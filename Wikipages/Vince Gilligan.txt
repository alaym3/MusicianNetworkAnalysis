== Early life ==

Vince Gilligan was born on February 10, 1967 in [[Richmond, Virginia]], the son of Gail, a grade school teacher, and George Vincent Gilligan Sr., an insurance [[claims adjuster]].<ref name="nytimes">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/10/magazine/the-dark-art-of-breaking-bad.html?pagewanted=all |title=The Dark Art of 'Breaking Bad' |last=Segal |first=David |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 6, 2011 |access-date=September 14, 2013 }}</ref> His parents divorced in 1974. He and his younger brother, Patrick, were raised in [[Farmville, Virginia|Farmville]] and [[Chesterfield County, Virginia|Chesterfield County]], and attended J.P. Wynne Campus School, the [[laboratory school]] run by [[Longwood College]], where his mother also taught; Gilligan would later use the name J.P. Wynne for the [[J. P.

His interest in film began when Wall's mother, Jackie, who also taught alongside Gilligan's mother at J.P. Wynne, would lend her [[Super 8 film cameras]] to him. He used the camera to make [[science fiction]] films with Patrick.<ref name="richmondmag">{{cite web|url=http://www.richmondmagazine.com/articles/bad-man-06-28-2011.html?page=1 |title=Bad Man |author= Foster, Richard |publisher=Richmond Magazine |date=July 2011 |access-date=September 20, 2013 }}</ref> One of his first films was entitled ''Space Wreck'', starring his brother in the lead role. One year later, he won first prize for his age group in a film competition at the [[University of Virginia]].<ref name="chesterfield" /> Jackie would take Wall and Gilligan to Richmond and drop them off at Cloverleaf Mall to see films, and encourage both of them to pursue a career in the arts. "I wouldn't be where I am today if it weren't for Jackie. She was a wonderful lady and a real inspiration," he recalls.<ref name="richmondmag" /> Gilligan was recognized for his talents and creativity at an early age. George Sr. described him as a "kind of a studious-type young man, and he liked to read, and he had a vivid imagination". He introduced Gilligan to [[film noir]] classics, as well as [[John Wayne]] and [[Clint Eastwood]] Westerns on late-night television.<ref name="richmondmag" /> Gilligan won a scholarship to attend the prestigious [[Interlochen Center for the Arts]]. After eighth grade, he moved back to Chesterfield to attend high school.<ref name="chesterfield" />

== Education ==
After graduating from [[Lloyd C. Bird High School]] in 1985, Gilligan went on to attend [[NYU]]'s [[Tisch School of the Arts]] on a scholarship, receiving a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in [[film production]].<ref>[http://www.mahalo.com/vince-gilligan "Biography at Mahalo"] November 25, 2009.</ref> While at NYU, he wrote the screenplay for ''[[Home Fries]]''; Gilligan received the Virginia Governor's Screenwriting Award in 1989 for the screenplay which was later turned into a film.<ref name="amctv1" /> One of the judges of the competition was [[Mark Johnson (producer)|Mark Johnson]], a film producer. He was impressed by Gilligan, saying he "was the most imaginative writer I'd ever read".<ref name="richmondmag" />

== Career ==

=== ''The X-Files'' and ''The Lone Gunmen'' ===
{{Main|The X-Files (franchise)}}
Gilligan's big break came when he joined the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television drama ''[[The X-Files]]''. Gilligan was a fan of the show, and submitted a script to Fox which became the second-season episode "[[Soft Light (The X-Files)|Soft Light]]".<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Truth is Out There: The Official Guide to the X-Files |first=Brian |last=Lowry |publisher=Harper Prism |year=1995 |isbn=0-06-105330-9| pages=219–221}}</ref> He went on to write 29 more episodes, in addition to being co-executive producer of 44 episodes, executive producer of 40, co-producer of 24, and supervising producer of 20. He also co-created and became executive producer of ''The X-Files'' spin-off series ''[[The Lone Gunmen (TV Series)|The Lone Gunmen]]''. The series only ran for one season of 13 episodes.

=== ''Breaking Bad'' and ''Better Call Saul'' ===

[[Image:Vince Gilligan 2010.jpg|thumb|195 px|right|Gilligan in 2010]]
Gilligan created, wrote, directed, and produced the [[AMC (TV network)|AMC]] drama series ''[[Breaking Bad]]''. He created the series with the premise that the [[hero]] would become the [[villain]]. "Television is historically good at keeping its characters in a self-imposed stasis so that shows can go on for years or even decades," he said. "When I realized this, the logical next step was to think, how can I do a show in which the fundamental drive is toward change?"<ref name="grantland">{{cite web|last=Klosterman|first=Chuck|title=Bad Decisions |url=http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/6763000/bad-decisions|work=Grantland|date=July 12, 2011 |access-date=July 17, 2011}}</ref> He added that his goal with [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] was to turn him from "[[Goodbye, Mr. Chips|Mr. Chips]] into [[Tony Montana|Scarface]]".<ref name="Bowles0713">{{cite news |last=Bowles |first=Scott |title='Breaking Bad' Shows Man at His Worst in Season 4 |work=[[USA Today]] |date=July 13, 2011 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2011-07-12-breaking-bad-season-4_n.htm |access-date=July 26, 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/60TswtrpQ?url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2011-07-12-breaking-bad-season-4_n.htm |archive-date=July 27, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> While pitching the show to studios, Gilligan was initially discouraged when he learned of the existing series ''[[Weeds (TV series)|Weeds]]'' and its similarities to the premise of ''Breaking Bad''. While his producers convinced him that the show was different enough to still be successful, he later stated that he would not have gone forward with the idea had he known about ''Weeds'' earlier.<ref name=huffington-weeds>{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/17/vince-gilligan-breaking-bad_n_1679038.html |title=Vince Gilligan Talks 'Breaking Bad' Beginnings, 'Weeds' |work=Huffington Post |date=July 17, 2012 |access-date=October 23, 2012}}</ref>

''Breaking Bad'' received widespread critical acclaim and has been praised by many critics as being among the greatest television dramas of all time.<ref name="grantland" /> Gilligan has been awarded numerous times for writing, directing, and producing the series. The [[Writers Guild of America]] has awarded him four times in straight succession, from 2012 to 2014; three as a part of the ''Breaking Bad'' writing team and one individually for writing the episode "[[Box Cutter (Breaking Bad)|Box Cutter]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=4816|title=2012 Writers Guild Awards Winners Announced|publisher=wga.org|access-date=February 10, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222040902/http://www.wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=4816|archive-date=February 22, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2013/02/18/2013-wga-awards-the-complete-list-of-winners/|title= 2013 WGA Awards Winners Complete List|publisher=time.com |date= February 18, 2013|access-date=February 10, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/wga-awards-2014-winners-676344|title= WGA Awards 2014 Winners Complete List|publisher=hollywoodreporter.com |access-date=February 10, 2014}}</ref> He also received two [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series|Primetime Emmys]] in 2013 and 2014 for producing the show.

In 2007, Gilligan and fellow ''The X-Files'' producer [[Frank Spotnitz]] wrote a [[sci-fi]] pilot entitled ''[[A.M.P.E.D.]]'', which was not picked up for a full series.

== Personal life ==
Gilligan has been with his girlfriend, Holly Rice, since 1991.<ref name="nytimes" /> In an interview in 2011, Gilligan stated that he was raised [[Catholic]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.npr.org/story/140111200|title='Breaking Bad' Creator Vince Gilligan On Meth And Morals|website=npr.org|access-date=March 25, 2018}}</ref> but added, "I'm pretty much agnostic at this point in my life. But I find atheism just as hard to get my head around as I find fundamental Christianity. Because if there is no such thing as cosmic justice, what is the point of being good?"<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/10/magazine/the-dark-art-of-breaking-bad.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=David | last=Segal | title=The Dark Art of 'Breaking Bad' | date=July 6, 2011}}</ref>

He further stated his philosophy as: "I feel some sort of need for biblical atonement, or justice, or something. I like to believe there is some comeuppance, that karma kicks in at some point, even if it takes years or decades to happen. My girlfriend says this great thing that's become my philosophy as well. 'I want to believe there's a heaven. But I can't not believe there's a hell.'"<ref name="nytimes.com" />
