'''The Maytals''', known from 1972 to 2020 as '''Toots and the Maytals''', are a Jamaican musical group, one of the best known [[ska]] and [[rocksteady]] vocal groups. The Maytals were formed in the early 1960s and were key figures in popularizing [[reggae]] music.

Hibbert met Henry "Raleigh" Gordon and Nathaniel "Jerry" Mathias in Kingston in 1962 and formed The Maytals as a vocal trio, a group whose early recordings were incorrectly attributed to The Flames and The Vikings in the UK by [[Island Records]].<ref name="Thompson" /> The first instrumentalist members added to the group included [[Jackie Jackson (bassist)|Jackie Jackson]], [[Hux Brown]], Rad Bryan, and [[Paul Douglas (musician)|Paul Douglas]].<ref>Sherman, Matthew. ''The Rise of Reggae, and the Influence of Toots and the Maytals''. The Dread Library, n.d. Web. 18 September 2016. http://debate.uvm.edu/dreadlibrary/sherman.html</ref> In 1972, the group changed its name from The Maytals to Toots and the Maytals,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-maytals-mn0000476645/biography |title=The Maytals: Artist Biography: AllMusic: Jo-Ann Greene |publisher=allmusic.com |access-date=6 November 2016}}</ref> with "Toots" referring to frontman [[Toots Hibbert]], and "the Maytals" referring to the group's instrumentalists and background vocalists.  In November 2016, Jackie Jackson described the formation of the group in a radio interview for Kool 97 FM Jamaica.<ref name=":1">Mikey T interview with Jackie Jackson, Paul Douglas, and Radcliffe "Dougie" Bryan. Kool 97 FM. kool97fm.com. 27 November 2016. <http://www.kool97fm.com> Retrieved 27 November 2016.</ref> Accompanied by [[Paul Douglas (musician)|Paul Douglas]] and Radcliffe "Dougie" Bryan in studio, Jackson explained, <blockquote>We're all original members of Toots and the Maytals band. First it was Toots and the Maytals, three guys: Toots, Raleigh, and Jerry…And then they were signed to [[Island Records]], [[Chris Blackwell]]. And we were their recording band...[<nowiki/>[[Chris Blackwell|Blackwell]]] decided that the backing band that back all of the songs, the recording band, should be the Maytals band. So everything came under Toots and the Maytals. And then we hit the road in 1975.<ref name=":1" /></blockquote>

===The 1960s===
The Maytals first had chart success when recording for [[Record producer|producer]] [[Coxsone Dodd|Clement "Coxsone" Dodd]] at [[Studio One (record label)|Studio One]].<ref name="Thompson" /> With musical backing from Dodd's [[house band]], [[the Skatalites]], the Maytals' close-[[harmony]] gospel singing ensured success, overshadowing Dodd's other up-and-coming vocal group, [[The Wailers (1963-1974 band)|the Wailers]]. After staying at Studio One for about two years, the group moved on to do sessions for [[Prince Buster]] before recording with [[Byron Lee]] in 1966.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |author=Mark Deming |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/toots-the-maytals-mn0000790988/biography |title=Toots & the Maytals &#124; Biography |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=19 August 2014}}</ref> With Lee, the Maytals won the first-ever [[Jamaica Independence Festival#Popular Song Competition|Jamaican Independence Festival Popular Song Competition]] in 1966 with their original song "Bam Bam". "Bam Bam" was later covered in a [[Dancehall]] style by [[Sister Nancy]] and also by [[Yellowman]] in 1982, but Toots and the Maytals were not credited or issued royalties for use of the song by either artist.<ref>{{cite web|title=What A Bam Bam! |publisher=The Jamaica Observer |url=https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/what-a-bam-bam-toots-moves-to-secure-royalties_200510 |date=10 August 2020 }}</ref><ref name="Bam Bam Copyright"> R.

Following Hibbert's release in 1967, the Maytals began working with the [[Chinese Jamaicans|Chinese Jamaican]] producer [[Leslie Kong]], a collaboration which yielded a string of [[hit record|hits]] throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s.<ref name="AMG"/> These included "[[Do the Reggay]]", released in 1968, which was the first song to first use the word "[[reggae]]" and gave the developing genre its name.<ref name="biography.com"/>

The Maytals are responsible for some of the biggest hits in reggae history, including "[[Pressure Drop (song)|Pressure Drop]]," "Sweet and Dandy" and "54-46 (That's My Number)".<ref name="biography.com" />

===The 1970s===
In 1970 "[[Monkey Man (Toots & the Maytals song)|Monkey Man]]" became the group's first international hit. By 1971, they signed a recording contract with [[Chris Blackwell]]'s [[Island Records]], become the biggest act in Jamaica, and had become international stars.<ref name="AMG"/> Blackwell initially concentrated on the UK market, where previous Jamaican acts had had success. The band's albums with Island Records were released through its Dragon Records imprint.

In 1972 the group won the Jamaican Independence Festival Popular Song Competition for a third time with "Pomp and Pride".<ref name="Thompson" /> That year, the group contributed two songs to the [[The Harder They Come (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] for ''[[The Harder They Come]]'', the 1972 film starring [[Jimmy Cliff]], named as one of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''{{'}}s top 10 soundtracks of all time.<ref name="Thompson" /> The film introduced Jamaican music to American audiences, and the band appears in one of the scenes.<ref name=":0" />

After Kong's death in 1971, the group continued to record with Kong's former [[audio engineering|sound engineer]], Warrick Lyn. Their re-instated producer Byron Lee renamed them Toots & the Maytals.<ref name="AMG"/> The group released three best-selling [[album]]s produced by Lyn and Blackwell of Island Records, and enjoyed international hits with ''[[Funky Kingston]]'' in 1973 and ''Reggae Got Soul'' in 1975. Music critic [[Lester Bangs]] described the album ''Funky Kingston'' in ''[[Stereo Review]]'' as "perfection, the most exciting and diversified set of reggae tunes by a single artist yet released".<ref>"Toots and the Maytals."

Encyclopedia.com. 6 October 2016 <http://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/toots-and-maytals>.</ref> [[Chris Blackwell]] had a strong commitment to Toots and the Maytals, saying "I've known Toots longer than anybody – much longer than Bob ([[Bob Marley]]).

{{quote box|quoteThe quick way to explain the Maytals is to say that in reggae they're the [[Beatles]] to [[the Wailers]]' [[Rolling Stones]]. But how do I explain Toots himself?

On 1 October 1975, Toots and the Maytals were broadcast live on [[KMET-FM]] as they performed at [[The Roxy Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]]. This broadcast was re-mastered and released as the ''Sailin' On'' album via Klondike Records.<ref>Toots and the Maytals (1975) Sailin' On. Obiterdictum. Web.

Toots and the Maytals' compositions experienced a resurgence of popularity in 1978–80 during the reggae punk and ska revival period in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], when [[the Specials]] covered "Monkey Man" on their 1979 debut album and [[the Clash]] covered the group's hit "[[Pressure Drop (song)|Pressure Drop]]". During this period Toots and the Maytals were also included in the [[lyrics]] to [[Bob Marley & the Wailers]]' song, "[[Punky Reggae Party]]": "The Wailers will be there, [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]], [[the Jam]], the Clash, the Maytals will be there, [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]] too".

===The 1980s===

====''Guinness Book of World Records''====
On 29 September 1980, the band recorded, pressed and distributed a new album, ''Toots Live'', to the record shops all in the space of 24 hours in an attempt to make the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]''.<ref name="Thompson" /> A live concert was recorded on reels of two-inch, 24-track analog tape, then rushed by van to sound engineers. After a running order was determined, the record label was quickly designed and sent to the printers. The album masters, labels and the outer covers were then separately sped to the Gedmel factory near [[Leicester]], and the finished product was assembled and delivered to [[Coventry]], where the band was playing the next day, successfully meeting the 24-hour deadline. Due to record label oversight, the achievement was not successfully registered with the ''Guinness Book of World Records''. [[Island Records]]' Rob Bell was quoted as saying, "Unfortunately, the record was ''not'' included in the Guinness book, because they required prior notification that the event was going to take place, and no one at Island had informed them of the project!"<ref>''Mojo'', September 2012, pp. 32–33</ref> The record for "fastest album release" was not officially held in the ''Guinness Book of World Records'' until 28 years later when Vollgas Kompanie claimed the honour in 2008 for recording and releasing their album ''Live'' in 24 hours – matching the time interval in which Toots and the Maytals recorded, pressed and distributed ''Toots Live'' in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/fastest-album-release/ |title= Fastest album release |publisher=guinnessworldrecords.com |access-date=29 June 2016}}</ref>

The group split up after releasing the 1981 album ''Knockout''.<ref name="Thompson" /> In 1982, Toots & the Maytals' "Beautiful Woman" reached [[chart-topper|number one]] in [[List of number-one singles in 1982 (New Zealand)|New Zealand]].<ref name="AMG"/>

Hibbert continued to record as a solo artist throughout the 1980s.

[[Donald Trump]] was quoted as appreciating the [[reggae]] music of Toots and the Maytals in 2004 when he said, "I heard the guest band, Toots & The Maytals, practising out on the set of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''" (Trump was the guest host on an episode in April 2004). "They sounded terrific, and I went out to listen to them for a while. My daughter [[Ivanka Trump|Ivanka]] had told me how great they were, and she was right.

In 2006, they recorded a reggae/ska version of [[Radiohead]]'s "[[Let Down (Radiohead song)|Let Down]]" for the [[tribute album]], ''[[Radiodread]]''. The album was a song for song makeover of the British [[rock band]]'s album ''[[OK Computer]]'' into reggae, dub and ska. In August 2007 Toots & the Maytals released ''Light Your Light'', which featured re-workings of older songs such as "Johnny Cool Man", as well as new material. The album was nominated in 2008 for a [[50th Grammy Awards|Grammy]] in the best reggae album category.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}

In May 2013, Hibbert was struck in the head with a 1.75-litre vodka bottle while performing onstage at a [[Richmond, Virginia]], festival. His injuries resulted in a concussion and treatment required six staples in his head. The man who threw the bottle was arrested, and despite Hibbert's pleas for clemency to the judge, was given a six-month sentence. Hibbert's letter to the judge also detailed the extent of his injury: "I continue to suffer from extreme anxiety, memory loss, headaches, dizziness and most sadly of all, a fear of crowds and performing.

Toots and the Maytals have been cited as an inspiration for other music artists when it comes to career longevity. Jamaican artist [[Sean Paul]] explains this by saying, "I've seen some great people in my industry, you know, people like Toots … Toots and the Maytals. Toots he's a great reggae artist and he's still doing it … He's up there in years and he's doing it. Those kind of artists inspire me. I know I’m just going to keep on doing music as long as I can."<ref>"Sean Paul". The Breakfast Club. 21 November 2016.

On 24 June 2017 at the [[Glastonbury Festival]], Toots and the Maytals were slotted for 17:30 with BBC Four scheduled to show highlights from their set. When they did not appear it was suspected they missed their time slot, and [[BBC]] broadcaster Mark Radcliffe apologised on their behalf stating, "If you were expecting Toots and the Maytals – and, frankly, we all were – it seems like they were on Jamaican time or something because they didn't make it to the site on time." The group was subsequently rescheduled by the Glastonbury Festival organizers giving them the midnight slot, with all other acts being shifted by one hour.<ref>Jones, Tim.

In November 2020, Paul Douglas and Jackie Jackson confirmed that the band would carry on, as a tribute to Hibbert.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.caribbeannationalweekly.com/entertainment/toots-is-gone-but-the-maytals-carry-on|title = Toots is Gone, but the Maytals Carry on|date = 27 November 2020}}</ref>

In July 2021 the family of Toots Hibbert issued a cease and desist letter to the members of The Maytals Band. The letter sought to prohibit the remaining band members from performing under the name "The Maytals" (the name the band has been performing under for over 50 years).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iriefm.net/music-fans-react-to-the-maytals-cease-and-desist-letter-from-toots-hibberts-estate/|title=Music fans react to the Maytals cease-and-desist letter from Toots Hibbert’s Estate|date=21 July 2021|publisher=iriefm.net}}</ref> Subsequently a Toots Hibbert tribute concert where multiple artists were scheduled to perform in [[London]] on 4 September 2021 was cancelled as a result of the cease and desist letter. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/entertainment/20210813/tribute-concert-toots-spiked-cease-and-desist-letter|title=Tribute concert for Toots spiked by cease-and-desist letter|date=13 August 2021|publisher=Jamaica Gleaner}}</ref>
