K.K. Slider will appear in the game after the player receives a three star rating in their island. After that, K.K. Slider will appear every Saturday (unless there is a special event) and accept requests for his songs. The first time the player listens to one of his songs, K.K. Slider will slide that song into their pockets - however only one song is received per week. Players can also select their own mood, let K.K. Slider pick his own song or type in the song they want.<ref>{{Cite web|title=K.K.
