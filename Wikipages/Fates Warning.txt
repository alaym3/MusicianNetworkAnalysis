'''Fates Warning''' is an American [[progressive metal]] band,<ref name=Allmusic/> formed in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], in 1982 by vocalist [[John Arch]], guitarists [[Jim Matheos]] and Victor Arduini, bassist Joe DiBiase, and drummer Steve Zimmerman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Fates+Warning |title=FATES WARNING Profile|website=Discogs.com |access-date=2012-03-06}}</ref> There have been numerous lineup changes over the course of their {{Age|1982|1|1}}-year career, and Matheos is the only constant member. As of 2020, the band consists of Matheos, vocalist [[Ray Alder]] (who replaced Arch in 1987), bassist [[Joey Vera]] (who replaced DiBiase in 1996), drummer [[Bobby Jarzombek]] and guitarist Michael Abdow. Fates Warning also had a revolving cast of drummers and guitarists by the time Jarzombek and Abdow joined the band in 2007 and 2020 respectively.

A pioneer of the progressive metal movement, Fates Warning has been referred to as one of the "Big Three" of the genre, creating and popularizing the style along with [[Queensrÿche]] and [[Dream Theater]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Progressive Metal|url=http://www.progarchives.com/subgenre.asp?style=19|website=Progarchives}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/progressive_metal_legend_jim_matheos_reveals_why_he_thinks_metal_has_become_repetitive_talks_new_archmatheos_album_and_more.html |title=Progressive Metal Legend Jim Matheos Reveals Why He Thinks Metal Has Become Repetitive, Talks New Arch/Matheos Album and More |website=Ultimate-Guitar.com |date=10 May 2019 |access-date=8 July 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://wailmusicmag.com/blogs/latest-news/posts/zonder-wehrkamp |title=Zonder/Wehrkamp: Members of Shadow Gallery, Fates Warning release debut album 'If It's Real' |publisher=Wail Music Magazine |access-date=8 July 2020}}</ref> Their early work, influenced by the [[new wave of British heavy metal]], is also important in the development of [[Power metal#American style|American power metal]].<ref name=MusicMight>{{cite web |author=Taniwha |title=Fates Warning biography |url=http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/united+states/connecticut/hartford/fates+warning |publisher=[[MusicMight]] |access-date=2015-08-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701011448/http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/united+states/connecticut/hartford/fates+warning |archive-date=1 July 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="AZ of Power Metal">{{Cite book|last1=Sharpe-Young|first1= Garry|author-link1= MusicMight|title= A–Z of Power Metal|series= Rockdetector Series|year= 2003|publisher= Cherry Red Books|isbn= 978-1-901447-13-2}}</ref> Fates Warning has released thirteen studio albums, two live albums, one compilation album, one VHS cassette, three DVDs (each featuring live concerts) and four demo tapes.

==History==

===Early career and first three albums (1982−1986)===
The first album, ''[[Night on Bröcken]]'', was released in 1984 on the [[Metal Blade]] label. The album was mainly influenced by [[Iron Maiden]] and other heavy metal bands, in songs like the title track and "Damnation" in particular. There were [[Progressive rock|prog]] aspects that would be further developed in subsequent albums. ''[[The Spectre Within]]'' (1985) featured a more progressive approach with songs like "The Apparition", "Epitaph", "Pirates of the Underground" and "Traveler in Time", with many tempo changes, a greater complexity in the arrangements, and fantasy lyrics full of symbolism and double meaning.{{sfn|Wagner|2010|pp=55-56}} During this period, Fates Warning had become a live staple in the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] areas of the US, sharing the stage with numerous bands like [[Motörhead]], [[Queensrÿche]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]], [[Anvil (band)|Anvil]] and [[Armored Saint]].<ref name="tour">{{cite web|url=http://fateswarning.com/tour/tour-history/|title=Tour History – Fates Warning|website=fateswarning.com|access-date=April 6, 2021}}</ref>

In 1986, original guitarist Victor Arduini left the band and was replaced by [[Frank Aresti]], and the third Fates Warning album, ''[[Awaken the Guardian]]'', was released in November of that year.<ref name="tour"/> It has been regarded as a groundbreaking and essential [[Progressive metal]] release,<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Essential Progressive Metal Album|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2016-10-23/10-essential-progressive-metal-albums|website=TeamRock}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Wagner|first1=Jeff|title=Awaken The Guardian|url=https://www.decibelmagazine.com/2016/03/02/fates-warning-awaken-the-guardian/|website=Decibel Magazine}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Awaken The Guardian|url=https://powerofprog.com/fates-warning-awaken-the-guardian-30th-anniversary-retrospective/|website=Power of Prog}}</ref> working towards creating a more mythical atmosphere and a more fully realized progressive approach in song form; with complex and unusual riffs, and numerous tempo changes amidst frenetic and evocative vocal lines, however maintaining a basic fluidity.{{sfn|Wagner|2010|pp=56-57}} ''Awaken the Guardian'' also made history by becoming the first album released on Metal Blade to enter the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart,<ref name="billboard"/> and saw Fates Warning sharing the stage with bands like Queensrÿche and [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]].<ref name="tour"/>

===Lineup changes and rise to near fame (1987−1993)===

[[File:Fates Warning during the Keep It True Festival, Germany, 2016 (2).jpg|alt=Fates Warning|thumb|Fates Warning at KIT Festival (2016)]]

In 1987, original vocalist John Arch left the band prior to the start of work on the band's next album, and was replaced by [[Ray Alder]]. Their first album with Alder, ''[[No Exit (Fates Warning album)|No Exit]]'' was released in March 1988<ref name="tour"/> and further developed the direction taken by the prior album with a more powerful sound all the while setting aside the fantasy themes and atmospheres. It featured one of the first [[Progressive metal|prog metal]] suite of the genre, "The Ivory Gate of Dreams," which is based on the [[Gates of horn and ivory]]. ''No Exit'' gave Fates Warning their highest chart position to date on the ''Billboard'' 200, entering at number 111 and staying on the chart for thirteen weeks;<ref name="billboard"/> it also helped build the band's popularity worldwide, with the videos for "Anarchy Divine" and "Silent Cries" receiving considerable airplay on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Headbangers Ball]]'',<ref name="hbb">{{cite web|url=https://www.headbangersballunofficialtributesite.com/episode-database|title=Headbangers Ball- The Unofficial Tribute Site - Episode Database|website=headbangersballunofficialtributesite.com|access-date=April 6, 2021}}</ref> and Fates Warning touring almost non-stop in support of the album, playing with bands like [[Krokus (band)|Krokus]], [[Savatage]], [[Armored Saint]] and [[Flotsam and Jetsam (band)|Flotsam and Jetsam]].<ref name="tour"/>

Following the tour in support of ''No Exit'', original drummer Steve Zimmerman left the band in 1988 and was replaced by [[Mark Zonder]], just as Fates Warning was preparing for their fifth studio album. The resulting album, ''[[Perfect Symmetry (Fates Warning album)|Perfect Symmetry]]'', was released in August 1989.<ref name="tour"/> The album abandoned the aggressive sound of ''No Exit'', in favor of a more melodic and experimental one along with a melancholic atmosphere and intimate lyrics. ''Perfect Symmetry'' was full of extremely complex arrangements and an unusual and very articulated rhythm section,{{sfn|Wagner|2010|pp=60-61}} and is often regarded as a seminal prog metal album, "which laid the foundations of the sound of the 90s".<ref name="rocking.gr">{{cite web|title=The Absolute Guide To Progressive Metal|url=http://www.rocking.gr/articles/en/The-Absolute-Guide-To-Progressive-Metal/17150/|website=rocking.gr}}</ref> [[Kevin Moore]] (keyboardist for [[Dream Theater]] at the time) was featured as a guest on the song "At Fate's Hands", while the cover was designed by [[Hugh Syme]], famous for his work with the Canadian [[progressive rock]] band [[Rush (band)|Rush]]. Although ''Perfect Symmetry'' was not as successful as ''No Exit'', the album nonetheless charted for nine weeks on the ''Billboard'' 200,<ref name="billboard"/> while its only music video "Through Different Eyes" managed to get some airplay on ''Headbangers Ball''.<ref name="hbb"/> The album also saw the band embark on their first full-length world tour, which lasted for a year between November 1989 and November 1990; they opened for [[Manowar]] in Europe and toured there again with [[Sanctuary (band)|Sanctuary]], who had also opened for Fates Warning in the US in early 1990.<ref name="tour"/>

1991 saw the release of ''[[Parallels (album)|Parallels]]'', distributed by [[Warner Music Group|Warner]]. The album, which started the collaboration with Rush producer [[Terry Brown (record producer)|Terry Brown]], contains more accessible and streamlined songs than in the past, except for tracks such as "The Eleventh Hour" and "Life in Still Water", which features guest vocals by [[James LaBrie]] (who had just joined [[Dream Theater]]).{{sfn|Wagner|2010|p=62}} ''Parallels'' is considered by some an essential album that "has influenced a great amount of subsequent musicians"<ref name="rocking.gr"/> and is possibly the band's most commercially successful record, despite the fact that it did not enter the ''Billboard'' 200 chart like the previous three albums did and was released during the [[grunge]] breakout; it did, however, appear on the Top 10 on the [[Top Heatseekers|''Billboard'' Heatseekers]] chart.<ref>{{cite web|title=Parallels|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/parallels-mw0000676962|website=AllMusic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/Fates-Warning/chart-history/NNE/song/180233|title=Parallels Chart History|website=Billboard.com|access-date=May 2, 2021}}</ref> With ''Parallels'', Fates Warning's popularity was still dominant in the US and Europe, with the videos for "Point of View" and "Eye to Eye" receiving heavy rotation on ''Headbangers Ball'',<ref name="hbb"/> and the band going on high-profile tours with the likes of [[Pantera]] and [[Savatage]] during 1992 as well as headlining the second night of the [[Wacken Open Air]] festival in Germany in 1993.<ref name="tour"/>

===Later years (1994−2009)===
Slowing down after the commercial success of previous releases, the follow-up to ''Parallels'' took two and a half years for Fates Warning to make. The resulting album, ''[[Inside Out (Fates Warning album)|Inside Out]]'' (1994), continued in the general vein of the previous album while adding more melody to their songs. The band's lineup also remained intact between albums for the first time since ''Spectre Within''. Band members have attributed the album's comparative lack of success to confusion while writing this album in the wake of the success of ''Parallels'' and their subsequent failure to maintain creative momentum. Just like ''Parallels'', ''Inside Out'' entered the Top 10 on [[Top Heatseekers|''Billboard'' Heatseekers]] chart in spite of little or no airplay due to the increasing popularity of grunge and [[alternative rock|alternative]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/Fates-Warning/chart-history/NNE/song/187478|title=Inside Out Chart History|website=Billboard.com|access-date=May 2, 2021}}</ref> and following its release, the band opened for [[Dream Theater]] in the U.S. and Europe on their ''[[Awake (Dream Theater album)|Awake]]'' tour.<ref name="tour"/>

A compilation album, ''[[Chasing Time (compilation)|Chasing Time]]'', was released in 1995 and included two previously unreleased songs.

In 1996, both Joe DiBiase and Frank Aresti left the group. The three remaining members, Alder, Matheos and Zonder, joined by new member [[Joey Vera]] on bass and [[Kevin Moore]] as a guest keyboardist, released ''[[A Pleasant Shade of Gray]]'' the following year. Written as a [[concept album]], ''A Pleasant Shade of Gray'' revealed a much darker and bleaker mood in writing style than had been heard before from the band. The album consists of a single 53-minute song split into twelve parts, making it the longest track Fates Warning has ever recorded.

A live two-CD set, ''[[Still Life (Fates Warning album)|Still Life]]'', was released in 1998, containing ''A Pleasant Shade of Gray'' performed live in its entirety. Joey Vera (bass), [[Redemption (band)|Bernie Versailles]] (guitars) and Jason Keazer (keyboards) accompanied the group on this album. A Japanese version included a studio cover of the [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]]' "In Trance".

The lineup for [[A Pleasant Shade of Gray]] consisting of Alder, Matheos, Zonder, Vera, and Moore, returned to record ''[[Disconnected (Fates Warning album)|Disconnected]]'' in 2000. In 2003, [[Frank Aresti]] was asked to fill in on a tour with [[Dream Theater]] and [[Queensrÿche]]. He officially rejoined the band as a full time member in 2005.

Their tenth studio release ''[[FWX]]'' was released in 2004. Drummer [[Mark Zonder]] stated it would be his last album with the band, as he wished to pursue other interests, and left in 2005. Although an official member again, Frank Aresti did not appear on the album because the writing had been completed and contracts had been signed already.

''[[Live in Athens (Fates Warning video album)|Live in Athens]]'', a concert DVD, was released in 2005; this DVD included guest drummer [[Nick D'Virgilio]].

In the liner notes to the 2005 expanded edition of ''[[Awaken the Guardian]]'', [[Dream Theater]] drummer [[Mike Portnoy]] noted that "very often fans and critics credit Dream Theater for creating a whole new genre of progressive metal music in the late '80s/early '90s, [...] but the truth is Fates Warning were doing it years before us."<ref>Review of the album ''Awaken the Guardian'' at [http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/f/fateswarning-awaken.shtml PopMatters.com]</ref>

The band has recorded songs for various "tribute" albums, including the tracks "[[Closer to the Heart]]" on the tribute to [[Rush (band)|Rush]], ''[[Working Man]]'', "Saints in Hell" on the 1997 ''Legends of Metal'', a [[Judas Priest]] tribute, and "Sign of the Southern Cross" on the 2000 ''Holy Dio'' [[Ronnie James Dio]] tribute. {{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Reunions with former members, ''Darkness in a Different Light'' and ''Theories of Flight'' (2010−2017)===
In 2010, Fates Warning played select dates with the ''[[Parallels (album)|Parallels]]'' lineup (Alder, Matheos, Zonder, Aresti and DiBiase) to celebrate the reissued, remastered and expanded edition of the classic album.

At the beginning of 2011, an announcement was made that Matheos and original vocalist John Arch had formed a band called [[Arch/Matheos]]. Their debut album was released in the autumn of that year, also featuring [[Joey Vera]] on bass guitar, [[Bobby Jarzombek]] on drums, and [[Frank Aresti]] on additional lead guitar.<ref>[http://www.bravewords.com/news/154379 Arch / Matheos Project Launched Featuring Past And Present Fates Warning Members; Band Tracking In The Studio], Bravewords.com. 2011-01-19. Retrieved on 2011-01-22.</ref>

After many delays, Fates Warning released its eleventh studio album ''[[Darkness in a Different Light]]'' on 27 September 2013. It was the band's first album since 2004's ''[[FWX]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=159803 |title=FATES WARNING To Begin Work On New Album |website=Roadrunnerrecords.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629051846/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=159803 |archive-date=29 June 2011 |access-date=2011-10-31 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=8057 |title=News - FATES WARNING To Release New Album In 2012 |website=[[KNAC|KNAC.com]] |date=23 June 2011 |access-date=2011-10-31 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930084122/http://knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=8057 |archive-date=30 September 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=193219 |title=FATES WARNING To Release 'Darkness In A Different Light' In September |website=Blabbermouth.net |access-date=2013-08-02}}</ref>

To celebrate the album's 30th anniversary, the ''Awaken the Guardian'' lineup (Arch, Matheos, Aresti, DiBiase and Zimmerman) reunited for a headlining appearance at the Keep It True festival in Germany on April 30, 2016.<ref>[https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/video-fates-warnings-awaken-the-guardian-lineup-performs-at-germanys-keep-it-true-festival/ "Fates Warning's Awaken the Guardian Lineup Performs at Germany's Keep it True Festival"].

===Return to Metal Blade and ''Long Day Good Night'' (2018−present)===
When asked in a June 2018 interview about the thirteenth Fates Warning album, frontman [[Ray Alder]] stated: "Right now, we're not in a writing mode. Everyone is kind of doing their own thing. I'm sure that will come out soon enough, of what everyone is doing. For the meantime, there are no plans to write another Fates Warning album — not in the near future, at least." Alder also commented on the band's future, saying: "Right now, there's just no plans to go into the studio or write. But, people are working on different things and we're working on another tour right now for South America, so that is still a little up in the air. It's 90 percent sure, but we'll see what happens with that. I can't say anything until it's confirmed."<ref>{{cite web|title=RAY ALDER: 'There Are No Plans To Write Another FATES WARNING Album In The Near Future'|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/ray-alder-there-are-no-plans-to-write-another-fates-warning-album-in-the-near-future/|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=June 25, 2018|access-date=June 30, 2018}}</ref>

On February 15, 2019, it was announced that Fates Warning had re-signed to [[Metal Blade Records]], and planned to begin working on a new album, for a 2020 release, after their spring tour with [[Queensrÿche]].<ref>{{cite web|title=FATES WARNING Returns To METAL BLADE RECORDS; New Album Due In 2020|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/fates-warning-returns-to-metal-blade-records-new-album-due-in-2020/|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=February 15, 2019|access-date=February 20, 2019}}</ref> In a December 2019 interview, bassist [[Joey Vera]] stated, "Fates Warning is not quite done writing, but pretty close.
