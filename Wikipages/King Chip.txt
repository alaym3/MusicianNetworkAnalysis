==Interior Crocodile Alligator==

In 2007, Worth appeared on PrettyBoy Floyd's show, "Street Stars' Radio", and performed a freestyle song to the beat of Ali & Gipp's "Go 'Head". It became known as the "S.L.A.B. Freestyle" (after his own label),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://genius.com/a/what-is-interior-crocodile-alligator-tiktok-meme-king-chip|title = A 2007 King Chip Freestyle "Interior Crocodile Alligator" is Going Viral on TikTok}}</ref> but it has, in recent years, come to be known more commonly as the "Interior Crocodile Alligator" song (or rap), after the iconic final four lines:

"Doors swang on niggas that got bad behavior / My four 15s woke up the neighbors / Interior crocodile alligator / I drive a Chevrolet movie theater."

This snippet of the freestyle became very popular on the internet, especially for usage in memes.
