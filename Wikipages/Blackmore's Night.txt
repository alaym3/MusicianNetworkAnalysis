'''Blackmore's Night''' is a British-American [[Folk music|traditional folk rock]] band formed in 1997, consisting mainly of [[Ritchie Blackmore]] ([[Steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitar]], [[hurdy gurdy]], [[mandola]], [[mandolin]], [[Nyckelharpa|nyckelharpe]] and [[electric guitar]]) and [[Candice Night]] (lead vocals, lyricist and [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]]). Their lineup has seen many changes over the years. To date, they have released eleven studio albums.

==History==
===Early===
Candice was a [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]] fan, and first encountered Ritchie Blackmore to ask him for an autograph in 1989, while she was working for a local New York radio station. The two started living together in 1991, and discovered they both had a passionate interest in [[Renaissance music]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smnnews.com/2011/01/07/blackmores-night-candice-night-vocals/ |title=Blackmore's Night – Candice Night (vocals) |work=SMNnews |author=Christian A. |date=7 January 2011 |access-date=30 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911134657/http://www.smnnews.com/2011/01/07/blackmores-night-candice-night-vocals/ |archive-date=11 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

During the reformed Rainbow's recording of the album ''[[Stranger in Us All]]'' in 1995, on which Night contributed some of the lyrics and backing harmony vocals, the duo were already gearing up their debut album. In 1997, the project started as being a [[pun]] of their own names, which would consist of themselves plus session musicians.

===1997 to 2005===

Their debut album ''[[Shadow of the Moon]]'' was a musical success and featured [[Ian Anderson]] of [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] on flute for the song "Play Minstrel Play". In subsequent albums, particularly ''[[Fires at Midnight]]'', there was an increased incorporation of rock guitar into the music, whilst maintaining a folk rock direction. Over time, Night has increasingly participated instrumentally as well as singing the vocals, and is competent in a wide variety of Renaissance instruments.
 
The group performs at [[Renaissance fair]]s and Renaissance festivals, as well as in stand-alone concert tours in appropriate venues including 'castle tours' of Europe, where they perform in historic surroundings for an audience dressed largely in period costume. The duo has been successful enough to inspire a number of international tribute bands including: ''Renaissance Night'', the Italian ''Morning Star,'' The ''Midnight'' and ''Elflore''.

They have also performed the music for [[MagiQuest]], a live simulation game.<ref>{{cite web |title=Blackmore's Night - The Music |work=The Official MagiQuest Homepage |url=http://magiquest.com/blackmores-night/ |access-date=11 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426025757/http://magiquest.com/blackmores-night/ |archive-date=26 April 2011 }}</ref>

===2006–present===

In 2006, Night performed a duet with [[Andi Deris]] on [[Helloween]]'s "Light the Universe", which was released as a single in certain countries and is available on their album ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys: The Legacy]]'', released in the same year.

On 27 June 2008, the duo released its seventh studio album called ''[[Secret Voyage]]'', a mix of medieval-sounding tracks and some contemporary ones. In addition to some covers of some traditional folk music (“Locked Within the Crystal Ball" is from the fourteenth century) and some originals, Blackmore's Night also performed a cover of a [[Rainbow (English band)|Rainbow]] song (“Rainbow Eyes”) and an [[Elvis Presley]] cover ("[[Can't Help Falling in Love]]").

A new album titled ''[[Autumn Sky]]'' was released at the end of 2010 in Europe and in 2011 in the U.S. This was followed by ''[[Dancer and the Moon]]'', in 2013, an album featuring covers of songs by [[Randy Newman]] ("[[I Think It's Going to Rain Today]]"), [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] ("[[Lady in Black (Uriah Heep song)|Lady in Black]]") and another Rainbow song (“Temple Of The King”, originally from the album ''[[Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow]]'').

Their album, ''All Our Yesterdays'', was released on 18 September 2015. Their latest studio album, ''Nature's Light'' was released worldwide on 12 March 2021.

==Personal life==
On 5 October 2008, Night and Blackmore were married after 19 years together. This is the fourth marriage for Blackmore.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.undercover.com.au/News-Story.aspx?id=6598 |title=Ritchie Blackmore and Candice Night Marry |first=Paul |last=Cashmere |date=20 October 2008 |work=Undercover.com.au |access-date=12 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211224750/http://undercover.com.au/News-Story.aspx?id=6598 |archive-date=11 February 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Autumn Esmerelda Blackmore was born on 27 May 2010.
