He had an older sister, Beverley (1935-2017).{{citation needed|date=June 2021}} His mother recognized Lightfoot's musical talent early on and schooled him into a successful child performer. His first public performance was "[[Too Ra Loo Ra Loo Ral]]" (an Irish lullaby) in grade four, which was broadcast over his school's public address system on a parents' day event.<ref name="larrywayneclark.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.larrywayneclark.com/lightfoot.html |title=Gordon Lightfoot—Portrait of a Painter |website=Larrywayneclark.com |access-date=April 13, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702050944/http://www.larrywayneclark.com/lightfoot.html |archive-date=July 2, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> As a youth, he sang, under the direction of choirmaster Ray Williams, in the choir of Orillia's St. Paul's United Church.

At the age of twelve, after winning a competition for boys whose voices had not yet changed, he made his first appearance at [[Massey Hall]] in Toronto. As a teenager, Lightfoot learned piano and taught himself to play drums and percussion. He held concerts in [[District Municipality of Muskoka|Muskoka]], a resort area north of Orillia, singing "for a couple of beers."<ref>{{cite web| title =Gordon Lightfoot article: "After 'Sundown,' Gordon Lightfoot makes up for lost time"|url=http://www.corfid.com/gl/press/press26.htm|website=Corfid.com| access-date=March 26, 2010}}</ref>

Lightfoot performed extensively throughout high school, [[Orillia District Collegiate & Vocational Institute]] (ODCVI), and taught himself to play folk guitar. A formative influence on his music at this time was 19th-century master American songwriter [[Stephen Foster]].<ref>Adria, Marco, "The Myth of Gordon Lightfoot," ''Music of Our Times: Eight Canadian Singer-Songwriters'' (Toronto: Lorimer, 1990), p. 15.</ref> He was also an accomplished high school track-and-field competitor and set school records for shot put and pole vault, as well as being the starting nose tackle on his school's Georgian Bay championship winning football team. His athletic and scholarly aptitude earned him scholarships at [[McGill University]]'s [[Schulich School of Music]] and the [[University of Toronto, Faculty of Music]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Lightfoot moved to California in 1958 to study jazz composition and orchestration for two years at Hollywood's Westlake College of Music, which had many Canadian students. To support himself while there, he sang on demonstration records and wrote, arranged, and produced commercial jingles. Among his influences were the folk music of [[Pete Seeger]], [[Bob Gibson (musician)|Bob Gibson]], [[Ian and Sylvia|Ian and Sylvia Tyson]], and [[The Weavers]].<ref>"Profile of Gordon Lightfoot" in ''Wilson Biographies''.

After his return to Canada, Lightfoot performed with The Singin’ Swingin’ Eight, a group featured on [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] TV's ''[[Country Hoedown]],'' and with the Gino Silvi Singers. He soon became known at Toronto folk music oriented coffee houses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nicholasjennings.com/before-the-gold-rush|title=Before the Gold Rush - Flashbacks to the Dawn of the Canadian Sound|website=Nicholasjennings.com|access-date=September 26, 2021}}</ref><ref>McPherson, David.

In 1963, Lightfoot travelled in Europe and in the United Kingdom, and for one year he hosted BBC TV's ''Country and Western Show'', returning to Canada in 1964. He appeared at the [[Mariposa Folk Festival]] and began to develop a reputation as a songwriter. [[Ian and Sylvia|Ian and Sylvia Tyson]] recorded "Early Mornin' Rain" and "For Lovin' Me"; a year later both songs were recorded by [[Peter, Paul and Mary]]; other performers who recorded one or both of these songs included [[Elvis Presley]], [[Chad & Jeremy]], [[George Hamilton IV]], [[The Clancy Brothers]], and the [[Johnny Mann|Johnny Mann Singers]]. Established recording artists such as [[Marty Robbins]] ("[[Ribbon of Darkness]]"), [[Leroy Van Dyke]] ("I'm Not Saying"), [[Judy Collins]] ("Early Morning Rain"), [[Richie Havens]] and [[Spyder Turner]] ("I Can't Make It Anymore"), and [[The Kingston Trio]] ("Early Morning Rain") all achieved chart success with Gordon Lightfoot's material.

==United Artists years==

In 1965, Lightfoot signed a management contract with [[Albert Grossman]], who also represented many prominent American folk performers, and signed a recording contract with [[United Artists]] who released his version of "[[I'm Not Sayin']]" as a single. Appearances at the [[Newport Folk Festival]], ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', and New York's [[The Town Hall (New York City)|Town Hall]] increased his following and bolstered his reputation. 1966 marked the release of his debut album ''[[Lightfoot!]]'', which brought him greater exposure as both a singer and a songwriter. The album featured many now-famous songs, including "For Lovin' Me," "Early Mornin' Rain," "Steel Rail Blues," and "Ribbon of Darkness". On the strength of the ''Lightfoot!'' album, which blended Canadian and universal themes, Lightfoot became one of the first Canadian singers to achieve definitive home-grown stardom without having moved permanently to the United States to develop it.

To kick off Canada's [[Canadian Centennial|Centennial]] year, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] commissioned Lightfoot to write the "[[Canadian Railroad Trilogy]]" for a special broadcast on January 1, 1967.  Between 1966 and 1969, Lightfoot recorded four additional albums for United Artists: ''[[The Way I Feel (Gordon Lightfoot album)|The Way I Feel]]'' (1967), ''[[Did She Mention My Name?]]'' (1968), ''[[Back Here on Earth]]'' (1968), and the live recording ''[[Sunday Concert]]'' (1969), and consistently placed singles in the Canadian top 40, including "Go-Go Round", "Spin, Spin", and "The Way I Feel". His biggest hit of the era was a rendition of Bob Dylan's "[[Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;3 on the Canadian charts in December 1965. ''[[Did She Mention My Name?]]'', released in January 1968, featured "Black Day in July", about the 1967 Detroit riot. Weeks later, upon the [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]] on April 4, radio stations in 30 states pulled the song for "fanning the flames", even though the song was a plea for racial harmony.  Lightfoot stated at the time radio station owners cared more about playing songs "that make people happy" and not those "that make people think."  Unhappy at a lack of support from United Artists, he defected to [[Warner Bros. Records]], scoring his first major international hit in early 1971 with "If You Could Read My Mind".

Lightfoot's albums from this time were well received abroad but did not produce any hit singles. Outside of Canada, he remained better known as a songwriter than as a performer.

His success as a live performer continued to grow throughout the late 1960s. He embarked on his first Canadian national tour in 1967, and also performed in New York City. Between 1967 and 1974, Lightfoot toured Europe and was well-received on two tours of Australia.

UA continued to release "Best of" album compilations in the 1970s even after Lightfoot became a subsequent success at Warner Bros./Reprise.

==Warner Bros./Reprise years==
Lightfoot signed to Warner Bros./Reprise in 1970 and scored a major hit in the United States with "[[If You Could Read My Mind]]," which sold over one million copies by early 1971 and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

}}</ref> The song had originally appeared on the poorly-selling 1970 album ''[[Sit Down Young Stranger]].'' After the song's success, the album was reissued under the new title ''If You Could Read My Mind;'' it reached No.&nbsp;5 nationally and represented a major turning point in Lightfoot's career. The album also featured a second recorded version of "[[Me and Bobby McGee]]", as well as "The Pony Man," "Your Love's Return (Song for Stephen Foster)," and "Minstrel of the Dawn."

Over the next seven years, he recorded a series of successful albums that established him as a singer-songwriter:
* ''[[Summer Side of Life]]'' (1971), with songs "Ten Degrees and Getting Colder", "Miguel", "Cabaret", "Nous Vivons Ensemble", and the title track
* ''[[Don Quixote (album)|Don Quixote]]'' (1972), with "Beautiful", "Looking at the Rain", "Christian Island (Georgian Bay)", and the title track, which is a concert favorite
* ''[[Old Dan's Records]]'' (1972), with the title track, the two-sided single "That Same Old Obsession"/"You Are What I Am", and the songs "It's Worth Believin'" and "Can't Depend on Love"
* ''[[Sundown (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Sundown]]'' (1974). Besides the title track, it includes "Carefree Highway", "Seven Island Suite", "The Watchman's Gone", "High and Dry", "Circle of Steel", and "Too Late for Prayin'"
* ''[[Cold on the Shoulder (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Cold on the Shoulder]]'' (1975). Along with title track are songs "Bend in the Water", "The Soul Is the Rock", "Rainbow Trout", "All the Lovely Ladies" and the hit "Rainy Day People"
* A double compilation LP ''[[Gord's Gold]]'' (in 1975) containing nine new versions of his most popular songs from the United Artists era<ref>The selections on ''Gord's Gold'' and ''Gord's Gold, Vol. 2,'' as explained in the liner remarks for ''Gord's Gold,'' are all re-recordings because Lightfoot dislikes listening to his earlier material.</ref>
* ''[[Summertime Dream]]'' (1976), along with "[[The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald]]" are the songs "I'm Not Supposed to Care", "Race Among the Ruins", "Spanish Moss", "Never Too Close", and the title track
* ''[[Endless Wire (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Endless Wire]]'' (1978) with "Daylight Katy", "If Children Had Wings", "Sweet Guinevere", a new version of "The Circle Is Small" from ''Back Here on Earth'', and the title track

During the 1970s, Lightfoot's songs covered a wide range of subjects, including "Don Quixote", about Cervantes' famous literary character, "Ode to Big Blue", about the widespread killing of whales, "Beautiful", about the simple joys of love, "Carefree Highway", about the freedom of the open road, "Protocol", about the futility of war, and "Alberta Bound", which was inspired by a lonely teenaged girl named Grace he met on a bus while travelling to Calgary in 1971.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

In 1972, Lightfoot contracted [[Bell's palsy]], a condition that left his face partially paralyzed for a time. The affliction curtailed his touring schedule but Lightfoot nevertheless continued to deliver major hits: in June 1974 his classic single "[[Sundown (Gordon Lightfoot song)|Sundown]]" from the album ''Sundown'' went to [[Hot 100 No. 1 Hits of 1974|No.1]] on the American and Canadian charts. It would be his only number one hit in the United States. He performed it twice on NBC's ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' series. "Carefree Highway" (about [[Arizona State Route 74]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]) was the follow-up single from the same album. It charted in the Top 10 in both countries.<ref>{{cite web|author=William R. Weiss |url=http://www.lightfoot.ca/chron03.htm |title=Gordon Lightfoot Chronology |website=Lightfoot.ca |access-date=April 19, 2014}}</ref> Lightfoot wrote it after traveling from [[Flagstaff, Arizona]] on [[Interstate 17]] to Phoenix.

In late November 1975, Lightfoot read a ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine article<ref>{{cite web |url= http://gordonlightfoot.com/WreckOfTheEdmundFitzgerald.shtml |title=Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald - Gordon Lightfoot Song Lyrics |work=gordonlightfoot.com |year=2011 |access-date=November 10, 2011}}</ref> about the loss of the {{SS|Edmund Fitzgerald}}, which sank on November 10, 1975, on [[Lake Superior]] during a severe storm with the loss of all 29 crew members. The lyrics in his song, "[[The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald|The Wreck of the ''Edmund Fitzgerald'']]", released the following year, were substantially based on facts in the article. It reached number two on the United States ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' chart and was a number one hit in Canada. Lightfoot appeared at several 25th anniversary memorial services of the sinking, and continues personal contact with the family members of the men who perished in the ''Edmund Fitzgerald.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ssedmundfitzgerald.org/gordon-lightfoot-song/|title="The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald" by Gordon Lightfoot|publisher=S S Edmund Fitzgerald Online|access-date=January 12, 2018}}</ref>

"Sundown" and "The Wreck of the ''Edmund Fitzgerald''" continue to receive heavy airplay on many classic rock stations{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}. In 1978, Lightfoot had another top 40 hit on the United States Hot 100, a re-recorded version of "The Circle Is Small (I Can See It in Your Eyes)," which reached number 33.

During the 1980s and the 1990s, Lightfoot recorded six more original albums and a compilation for Warner Bros./Reprise: ''[[Dream Street Rose]]'' (1980), ''[[Shadows (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Shadows]]'' (1982), ''[[Salute (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Salute]]'' (1983), ''[[East of Midnight]]'' (1986), another compilation ''[[Gord's Gold, Vol. 2]]'' (1988), ''[[Waiting for You (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Waiting for You]]'' (1993), and ''[[A Painter Passing Through]]'' (1998).

The album ''Dream Street Rose'' has the folk-pop sound that Lightfoot established during the previous decade.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} In addition to the title song, it includes songs such as "Ghosts of Cape Horn" and "On the High Seas". It also includes the [[Leroy Van Dyke]] 1950s composition "The Auctioneer," a bluegrass-like number that was a concert staple for Lightfoot from the mid 1960s to the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

The album ''[[Shadows (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Shadows]]'' represents a departure from the acoustic sound of the 1970s and introduces an adult-contemporary sound.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Songs like "Shadows" and "Thank You for the Promises" contain an underlying sadness and resignation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The 1982 American released single "Baby Step Back" marked his last time in the top 50 in that country.
The 1983 album ''[[Salute (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Salute]]'' produced no hit singles; the 1986 ''East of Midnight'' album had several [[Adult Contemporary]] songs like "A Passing Ship", "Morning Glory", and "I'll Tag Along" (East of Midnight). A single from ''East of Midnight'', "Anything for Love", made the Billboard Country & Western chart. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

In April 1987, Lightfoot filed a lawsuit against composer [[Michael Masser]], claiming that Masser's melody for the song "The Greatest Love of All," versions of which were recorded and released by [[George Benson]] in 1977 and [[Whitney Houston]] in 1985, had stolen 24 bars from Lightfoot's 1971 hit song "If You Could Read My Mind". The transitional section that begins "I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow" of the Masser song has the same melody as "I never thought I could feel this way and I got to say that I just don't get it; I don't know where we went wrong but the feeling's gone and I just can't get it back" of Lightfoot's song. Lightfoot later stated that he did not want people thinking that he had stolen his melody from Masser.<ref>{{cite web|author=Florian BODENSEHER |url=http://www.corfid.com/gl/biography.htm |title=Gordon Lightfoot – Biography |website=Corfid.com |access-date=April 19, 2014}}</ref> The case was settled out of court and Masser issued a public apology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://storyofsongs.blogspot.com/2009/08/greatest-love.html |title=Greatest Love |date=August 29, 2009 |access-date=May 5, 2019}}</ref>

Lightfoot rounded out the decade with his follow-up compilation ''[[Gord's Gold, Vol. 2]],'' in late 1988, which contained re-recorded versions of his most popular songs, including a re-make of the 1970 song "The Pony Man." The original had been brisk in pace, acoustic, and about three minutes long. This new version was slower, clocking in at four minutes plus.

Lightfoot performed with noted Canadian artist Ian Tyson at the opening ceremonies of the 1988 winter Olympics in Calgary.
 
During the 1990s, Lightfoot returned to his acoustic roots and recorded two albums. ''[[Waiting for You (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Waiting for You]]'' (1993) includes songs such as "Restless", "Wild Strawberries", and Bob Dylan's "Ring Them Bells".  1998's ''A Painter Passing Through'' reintroduced a sound more reminiscent of his early recordings,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Chrispell|first=James|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1-pH4i3jXvAC&q=With+the+release+of+A+Painter+Passing+Through%2C+Lightfoot+appears+to+have+found+home+and+has+turned+in+his+best+work+in+years.+Gone+are+the+uncertain+arrangements+of+the+past%3B+in+their+place%2C+there+is+a+welcome+return+to+the+essence+of+the+%22Sundown%22+musical+era.&pg=PA654|title=All Music Guide to Rock: The Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul|publisher=Backbeat Books|year=2002|isbn=9780879306533|editor-last=Bogdanov|editor-first=Vladimir|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=654|chapter=A Painter Passing Through / May 12, 1998 / Reprise|editor-last2=Woodstra|editor-first2=Chris|editor-last3=Erlewine|editor-first3=Stephen Thomas}}</ref> with songs like "Much to My Surprise", "Red Velvet", "Drifters", and "I Used to Be a Country Singer". Throughout the decade, Lightfoot played about 50 concerts a year.<ref>{{cite web|author=William R. Weiss |url=http://www.lightfoot.ca/tourschd.htm |title=Gordon Lightfoot Tour Schedules |website=Lightfoot.ca |access-date=June 14, 2010}}</ref> In 1999 Rhino Records released ''[[Songbook (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Songbook]]'', a four-CD boxed set of Lightfoot recordings with rare and unreleased tracks from the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s plus a small hardback booklet for his fans that described how he created his songs and gave facts about his career.

In April 2000, Lightfoot taped a live concert in [[Reno, Nevada]]; this one-hour show was broadcast by CBC in October, and as a PBS special across the United States. PBS stations offered a videotape of the concert as a pledge gift, and a tape and DVD were released in 2001 in Europe and North America. This was the first Lightfoot concert video released. In April 2001, Lightfoot performed at the Tin Pan South Legends concert at [[Ryman Auditorium]] in Nashville, closing the show.  In May, he performed "Ring Them Bells" at [[Massey Hall]] in honour of Bob Dylan's 60th birthday.

==Illness and return to performing==
By January 2002, Lightfoot had written 30 new songs for his next studio album. He recorded guitar and vocal demos of some of these new songs. In September, before the second concert of a two-night stand in [[Orillia]], Lightfoot suffered severe stomach pain and was airlifted to McMaster Medical Centre in Hamilton, Ontario. He underwent emergency vascular surgery for a ruptured [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/entertainment/gordon-lightfoot-is-happy-to-be-all-live|title=Gordon Lightfoot is happy to be All Live|date=April 27, 2012|website=nationalpost.com|access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref> and he remained in serious condition in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Lightfoot endured a six-week coma and a [[tracheotomy]], and he underwent four surgical operations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1197/is_/ai_n16519941 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210091226/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1197/is_/ai_n16519941 |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 10, 2008 |title=CBSi |website=FindArticles.com |access-date=December 17, 2016 }}</ref> All of his remaining 2002 concert dates were cancelled. More than three months after being taken to the McMaster Medical Centre, Lightfoot was released in December to continue his recovery at home.

In 2003, Lightfoot underwent follow-up surgery to continue the treatment of his abdominal condition. In November he signed a new recording contract with [[Linus Entertainment]] and began rehearsing with his band for the first time since his illness.  Also in 2003, [[Borealis Records]], a related label to Linus Entertainment, released ''[[Beautiful: A Tribute to Gordon Lightfoot]]''.  On this album, various artists, including The [[Cowboy Junkies]], [[Bruce Cockburn]], [[Jesse Winchester]], [[Maria Muldaur]], and The [[Tragically Hip]] interpreted Lightfoot's songs. The final track on the album, "Lightfoot", was the only song not previously released by Lightfoot. It was composed and performed by [[Aengus Finnan]].

In January 2004, Lightfoot completed work on his album ''[[Harmony (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Harmony]]'', which he had mostly recorded prior to his illness. The album was released on his new home label of Linus Records on May 11 of that year.  It was his 20th original album and included a single and new video for "Inspiration Lady". Other songs were "Clouds of Loneliness," "Sometimes I Wish," "Flyin' Blind", and "No Mistake About It". The album contained the upbeat yet reflective track called "End of All Time"

In July 2004, he made a surprise comeback performance, his first since falling ill, at Mariposa in Orillia, performing "I'll Tag Along" solo. In August he performed a five-song solo set in [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]], Ontario, at a flood relief benefit. In November he made his long-awaited return to the concert stage with two sold-out benefit shows in [[Hamilton, Ontario]].

Lightfoot returned to the music business with his new album selling well and an appearance on ''[[Canadian Idol]]'', where the six top contestants each performed a song of his, culminating in a group performance – on their own instruments – of his ''[[Canadian Railroad Trilogy]]''. In 2005, he made a low-key tour called the ''Better Late Than Never Tour''.

On September 14, 2006, while in the middle of a performance, Lightfoot suffered a minor stroke that eventually left him without the use of the middle and ring fingers on his right hand. He returned to performing nine days later and for a brief time used a substitute guitarist for more difficult guitar work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onmilwaukee.com/music/articles/lightfoot.html |title=Music: Stroke doesn't diminish Lightfoots skills as an entertainer |date=September 25, 2006 |website=Onmilwaukee.com |access-date=June 14, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Denis Armstrong |url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/L/Lightfoot_Gordon/ConcertReviews/2006/11/12/2326377.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710212859/http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/L/Lightfoot_Gordon/ConcertReviews/2006/11/12/2326377.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 10, 2012 |title=CANOE – JAM!

Lightfoot said in 2016 that he was not planning to return to songwriting later in life as he had concluded it was "such an isolating thing" for him earlier in his career, affecting his family life.<ref name=":0" /> However, that changed in 2019 when he announced plans for a new studio album for the first time in nearly two decades.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}

His 2017 and 2018 tours included dozens of dates in Canada and the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lightfoot.ca/2018.htm|title=Gordon Lightfoot Tour Schedule 2018|first=William R.|last=Weiss|website=Lightfoot.ca|access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lightfoot.ca/2017.htm|title=Gordon Lightfoot Tour Schedule 2017|first=William R.|last=Weiss|website=Lightfoot.ca|access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref>
Lightfoot's 2019 tour was interrupted when he was injured while working out in a gym.  In March 2020 his concert schedule was interrupted by governmental restrictions during the [[COVID-19 pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].

On March 20, 2020, Lightfoot released ''Solo'' without the accompaniment of other musicians. It was his 21st studio album, released more than 54 years after his debut album.  It was released by Warner Music Canada, marking Lightfoot's return to Warner Music Group.

==Legacy==
Lightfoot's music career has spanned more than six decades, producing more than 200 recordings. He helped define the folk-pop sound of the 1960s and 1970s, with his songs recorded by artists such as Bob Dylan, [[Gene Clark]], [[Dan Fogelberg]], [[Jimmy Buffett]], and [[Jim Croce]].<ref name="activemusician1"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Kerns |first=William |url=http://lubbockonline.com/entertainment/2010-08-13/gordon-lightfoot-says-his-music-has-improved-over-lengthy-career |title=Gordon Lightfoot says his music has improved over lengthy career|work=Lubbock Online |date=August 13, 2010 |access-date=April 19, 2014}}</ref> The Canadian band [[The Guess Who]] recorded a song called "Lightfoot" on their 1968 album ''[[Wheatfield Soul]]''; the lyrics contain many Lightfoot song titles.

Bob Dylan made this comment about the artist: "I can't think of any Gordon Lightfoot song I don't like. Everytime I hear a song of his, it's like I wish it would last forever.... Lightfoot became a mentor for a long time. I think he probably still is to this day".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.audible.ca/pd/Lightfoot-Audiobook/B0771QLJ77|title=Audible.com - Over 425,000 of the Best Audiobooks & Original Content|website=Audible.ca|access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref>

In June 2017, Lightfoot rated fifth in the CBC's list of the ''25 best Canadian songwriters ever''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbcmusic.ca/posts/11889/best-canadian-songwriters|title=25 best Canadian songwriters ever|website=Cbcmusic.ca|access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref>

Lightfoot's biographer, Nicholas Jennings, said: "His name is synonymous with timeless songs about trains and shipwrecks, rivers and highways, lovers and loneliness. His music defined the folk-pop sound of the 1960s and 1970s. He is unquestionably Canada's greatest songwriter."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/541324/lightfoot-by-nicholas-jennings/9780143199212|title=Lightfoot by Nicholas Jennings - Penguin Random House Canada|website=Penguin Random House Canada|access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref>

==Sound==
Lightfoot's sound, both in the studio and on tour, is centred on Lightfoot's [[baritone]] voice and folk-based [[Twelve-string guitar|twelve-string]] acoustic guitar.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/gordon-lightfoot|title=Gordon Lightfoot|encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|date=2 August 2017|access-date=August 17, 2019}}</ref> From 1965 to 1970, lead guitarist [[Laurice Milton “Red” Shea|Red Shea]] was an important supporting player, with bassists Paul Wideman and John Stockfish filling out the arrangements.
[[File:Gordon Lightfoot.jpg|thumb|left|Performing in Toronto, 2008, playing his [[twelve-string guitar]]]]
In 1968 bassist Rick Haynes joined the band, and lead guitarist Terry Clements joined the following year. Shea left the touring band in 1970, but continued to record with Lightfoot until 1975. He hosted his own Canadian variety show, played with Ian Tyson, and became band leader for [[Tommy Hunter]]'s TV show in the 1980s on CBC. Shea played on most of Lightfoot's early hits.  Haynes and Clements remained with Lightfoot and composed the core of his band.

In 1975, Pee Wee Charles added [[pedal steel]] guitar to Lightfoot's songs. Drummer Barry Keane joined the following year and in 1981, keyboardist Mike Heffernan completed the ensemble. This five-piece backup band remained intact until 1987, when Charles left the band to operate a radio station in Southern Ontario.

Three members of Lightfoot's band have died over the years: Red Shea in June 2008 from pancreatic cancer, Clements at 63 on February 20, 2011, following a stroke<ref>{{cite web|author=Doc Rock |url=http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/2011.html |title=2011 January to June |work=The Dead Rock Stars Club |access-date=April 19, 2014}}</ref> and original bassist John Stockfish from natural causes on August 20, 2012, at 69.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/Deaths.20120830.93301879/BDAStory/BDA/deaths |title=John Stockfish |work=globeandmail.com |date=August 30, 2012 |access-date=September 2, 2012 |location=Toronto |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022020423/http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/Deaths.20120830.93301879/BDAStory/BDA/deaths |archive-date=October 22, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Personal life==
Lightfoot has been married three times. His first marriage in April 1963 was to a Swedish woman, Brita Ingegerd Olaisson, with whom he had two children, Fred and Ingrid. They divorced in 1973, the marriage ending in part because of his infidelity. Lightfoot has acknowledged that his musical touring and the fact that he found fidelity difficult in a long-distance relationship contributed to the failure of at least two relationships.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

The song "[[If You Could Read My Mind]]" was written in reflection upon his disintegrating marriage. At the request of his daughter, Ingrid, he performs the lyrics with a slight change now: the line "I'm just trying to understand the feelings that you lack" is altered to "I'm just trying to understand the feelings that ''we'' lack." He has said in an interview that the difficulty with writing songs inspired by personal stories is that there is not always the emotional distance and clarity to make lyrical improvements such as the one his daughter suggested.

Lightfoot was unmarried for 16 years. He has two other children from relationships between his first and second marriages:  Gaylen McGee and Eric Lightfoot.<ref>[http://www.corfid.com/vbb/archive/index.php/t-15235.html "Gord's eldest children"]; Gordon Lightfoot Forums.  Retrieved December 3, 2017.</ref>

In 1989, he married Elizabeth Moon. They had two children: Miles and Meredith.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gordon Lightfoot 'still out there': 12/4/00|url=http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20001204/NEWS/312049924|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213073247/http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20001204%2FNEWS%2F312049924|archive-date=December 13, 2013|access-date=December 9, 2013|website=[[South Coast Today]]}}</ref> They divorced in 2011 after a separation that Lightfoot said had lasted nine years.

To stay in shape to meet the demands of touring and public performing, Lightfoot works out in a gym six days per week, but declared in 2012 that he was "fully prepared to go whenever I'm taken." He calmly stated, "I've been almost dead a couple times, once almost for real ... I have more incentive to continue now because I feel I'm on borrowed time, in terms of age."<ref name="thespec1">{{cite web|url = http://www.thespec.com/whatson-story/2197822-gordon-lightfoot-making-the-best-use-of-borrowed-time-/|title = Gordon Lightfoot making the best use of 'borrowed time'|publisher = Thespec.com|date = April 24, 2012|access-date = April 19, 2014|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140315191051/http://www.thespec.com/whatson-story/2197822-gordon-lightfoot-making-the-best-use-of-borrowed-time-/|archive-date = March 15, 2014|url-status = dead}}</ref>
