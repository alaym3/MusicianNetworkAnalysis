'''Ian Robins Dury''' (12 May 1942{{snd}} 27 March 2000) was a British singer-songwriter and actor who rose to fame during the late 1970s, during the [[punk rock|punk]] and [[new wave music|new wave]] era of rock music. He was the lead singer of [[The Blockheads|Ian Dury and the Blockheads]] and before that of [[Kilburn and the High Roads]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Dury was born, and spent his early years, at his parents' home at 43 Weald Rise, [[Harrow Weald]], Middlesex (though he often pretended that he had been born in [[Upminster]], Essex, which all but one of his obituaries in the UK national press stated as fact).<ref>{{cite book | first= Richard | last= Balls | year= 2000 | title= Sex & Drugs & Rock'N'Roll: The Life of Ian Dury | edition= 1st | publisher=Omnibus Press | location= London | pages= 14–16 | isbn= 0-7119-8644-4 }}</ref> His father, William George Dury (born 23 September 1905, [[Southborough, Kent|Southborough]], Kent; died 25 February 1968), was a local bus driver and a former boxer, while his mother Margaret (known as "Peggy", born Margaret Cuthbertson Walker, 17 April 1910, [[Rochdale]], Lancashire; died January 1995)<ref>{{cite web |first=Richard |last=Balls |url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/73862 |title=Dury, Ian Robins (1942–2000), popular singer, songwriter, and actor |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=12 June 2018 |archive-date=12 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612144132/http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/73862 |url-status=live }}</ref> was a [[health visitor]], the daughter of a [[Cornish people|Cornish]] doctor and the granddaughter of an [[Irish people|Irish]] landowner.

William Dury trained with [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] to be a [[chauffeur]], and was then absent for long periods, so Peggy Dury took Ian to stay with her parents in Cornwall. After the [[Second World War]], the family moved to Switzerland, where his father chauffeured for a millionaire and the [[Western European Union]]. In 1946 Peggy brought Ian back to England and they stayed with her sister, Mary, a doctor in [[Cranham]], a small village in Essex. Although he saw his father on visits, they never lived together again.<ref>Balls, Richard (2000), pp. 16–24</ref>

At the age of seven, Dury contracted [[polio]], most likely, he believed, from a swimming pool at [[Southend-on-Sea]] during the [[History of poliomyelitis#Epidemics|1949 polio epidemic]]. After six weeks in a full plaster cast in the [[Royal Cornwall Infirmary]], [[Truro]], he was moved to [[Black Notley]] Hospital, [[Braintree, Essex]], where he spent a year and a half before going to [[Chailey Heritage School|Chailey Heritage Craft School]], East Sussex, in 1951. His illness resulted in the paralysis and withering of his left leg, shoulder and arm.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/hit-me-with-your-rhythm-shtick-how-did-ian-dury-become-one-of-the-most-fascinating-rock-stars-of-the-1850025.html|title=Hit me with your rhythm shtick: How did Ian Dury become one of the most fascinating rock stars of the 1970s?|date=3 January 2010|access-date=16 March 2021|author=Coleman, Nick|author-link=Nick Coleman|work=[[The Independent on Sunday]]|archive-date=12 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012215954/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/hit-me-with-your-rhythm-shtick-how-did-ian-dury-become-one-of-the-most-fascinating-rock-stars-of-the-1850025.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Chailey was a school and hospital for disabled children, and believed in toughening them up, contributing to the observant and determined person Dury became.<ref>Balls, Richard (2000) pp. 30–35</ref> Chailey taught trades such as [[cobbling]] and printing, but Dury's mother wanted him to be more academic, so his aunt Moll arranged for him to enter the [[Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe]], where he recounted being punished for misdemeanours by being made to learn long tracts of poetry until a housemaster found him sobbing and put a stop to it:
{{quote|I had to go into a box room where the suitcases were stored and learn 80 lines of ''[[To Autumn|Ode to Autumn]]'' by yer man [[John Keats|Keats]].

From 1964 he studied art at the [[Royal College of Art]] under [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], and in 1967 took part in a group exhibition, "Fantasy and Figuration", alongside [[Pat Douthwaite]], Herbert Kitchen and [[Stass Paraskos]] at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in London.<ref>ICA, ''Fantasy and Figuration,'' exhibition cat., London, 1967, Tate Archive (London) ref.

===Kilburn and the High Roads===
Dury formed [[Kilburn and the High Roads]] (a reference to [[Kilburn High Road|the road in North West London]]) in 1971,<ref>{{cite book |first1=Harris M. |last1=Berger |first2=Michael Thomas |last2=Carroll |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HhYxPacpJTEC&q=Kilburn+%26+the+High+Roads&pg=PA223 |title=Global pop, local language |page=223 |publisher=Univ.

Managed first by [[Charlie Gillett]] and Gordon Nelki and latterly by fashion entrepreneur [[Tommy Roberts Mr Freedom|Tommy Roberts]], the Kilburns found favour on London's [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|pub rock]] circuit and signed to Dawn Records in 1974 but, despite favourable press coverage and a tour opening for English rock band [[The Who]], the group failed to rise above cult status and disbanded in 1975.

Kilburn and the High Roads recorded two albums, ''[[Handsome (Kilburn and the High-Roads album)|Handsome]]'' and ''[[Wotabunch!]]''.<ref>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r42250|first=|last=}}</ref>

===The Blockheads===
{{main|The Blockheads}}
[[File:Ian Dury 2.jpg|thumb|right|Live at [[The Roundhouse]], [[Chalk Farm]], London, 1978]]
Under the management of [[Andrew King (music manager)|Andrew King]] and [[Peter Jenner]], the original managers of [[Pink Floyd]], Ian Dury and the Blockheads quickly gained a reputation as one of the top live acts of [[new wave music]].

Dury's lyrics are a combination of lyrical poetry, [[word play]], observation of British everyday life, character sketches, and sexual humour: "This is what we find&nbsp;... Home improvement expert Harold Hill of Harold Hill, Of do-it-yourself dexterity and double-glazing skill, Came home to find another gentleman's kippers in the grill, So he sanded off his winkle with his Black & Decker drill". The song "[[Billericay Dickie]]" rhymes "I had a love affair with Nina, In the back of my [[Ford Cortina|Cortina]]" with "A seasoned-up hyena Could not have been more obscener".

The Blockheads' sound drew from its members' diverse musical influences, which included [[jazz]], rock and roll, [[funk]], and [[reggae]], and Dury's love of [[music hall]]. The band was formed after Dury began writing songs with pianist and guitarist [[Chas Jankel|Chaz Jankel]] (the brother of music video, TV, commercial and film director [[Annabel Jankel]]). Jankel took Dury's lyrics, fashioned a number of songs, and they began recording with members of [[Radio Caroline]]'s Loving Awareness Band{{snd}} drummer [[Charley Charles]] (born Hugh Glenn Mortimer Charles, [[Guyana]] 1945), bassist [[Norman Watt-Roy]], keyboard player [[Mick Gallagher]], guitarist [[John Turnbull (musician)|John Turnbull]] and former Kilburns saxophonist [[Davey Payne]]. An album was completed, but major record labels passed on the band. Next door to Dury's manager's office was the newly formed [[Stiff Records]], a perfect home for Dury's maverick style.

The single "[[Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll]]", released 26 August 1977, marked Dury's Stiff debut. Although it was banned by the [[BBC]] it was named Single of the Week by ''[[NME]]'' on its release.<ref name="pennyblack">{{cite web |url=http://www.pennyblackmusic.co.uk/magsitepages/Article/4896/Blockheads-Interview |first=John |last=Clarkson |title=Mickey Gallagher interview, October 2008 |publisher=Pennyblackmusic.co.uk |date=28 October 2008 |access-date=12 June 2018 |archive-date=12 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612152249/http://www.pennyblackmusic.co.uk/magsitepages/Article/4896/Blockheads-Interview |url-status=live }}</ref> The single issue was soon followed, at the end of September, by the album ''[[New Boots and Panties!!]]'' which, although it did not include the single (neither on the track list, album cover or record label, it was nonetheless actually present as track 1 on side 2 of all the original pressings), achieved platinum status.

[[File:duryegg.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Live at The Roundhouse, Chalk Farm, London, 1978]]
In October 1977 Dury and his band started performing as Ian Dury & the Blockheads, when the band signed on for the Stiff "Live Stiffs Tour" alongside [[Elvis Costello]] & [[the Attractions]], [[Nick Lowe]], [[Wreckless Eric]], and [[Larry Wallis]]. The tour was a success, and Stiff launched a concerted Ian Dury marketing campaign, resulting in the Top Ten hit "[[What a Waste]]", and the hit single "[[Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick]]", which reached No.&nbsp;1 in the UK at the beginning of 1979, selling just short of a million copies. Again, "Hit Me" was not included on the original release of the subsequent album ''[[Do It Yourself (Ian Dury & the Blockheads album)|Do It Yourself]]''. With their hit singles, the band built up a dedicated following in the UK and other countries and their next single "[[Reasons to be Cheerful, Part 3]]" made number three in the UK.
The band's second album ''Do It Yourself'' was released in June 1979 in a [[Barney Bubbles]]-designed sleeve of which there were over a dozen variations, all based on samples from the [[Crown Wallpaper|Crown wallpaper]] catalogue. Bubbles also designed the Blockhead logo.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.aural-innovations.com/robertcalvert/hawkwind/barney.htm |first=Roy |last=Carr |newspaper=[[New Musical Express]] |title=Barney Bubbles obituary |access-date=12 June 2018 |date=26 November 1983 |archive-date=5 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805175232/http://www.aural-innovations.com/robertcalvert/hawkwind/barney.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

Jankel left the band temporarily and relocated to the US after the release of "What a Waste" (his organ part on that single was overdubbed later) but he subsequently returned to the UK and began touring sporadically with the Blockheads, eventually returning to the group full-time for the recording of "Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick"; according to Mickey Gallagher, the band recorded 28 takes of the song but eventually settled on the second take for the single release. Partly due to personality clashes with Dury,<ref name="pennyblack"/> Jankel left the group again in 1980, after the recording of the ''Do It Yourself'' LP, and he returned to the US to concentrate on his solo career.
The group worked solidly over the eighteen months between the release of "Rhythm Stick" and their next single, "Reasons to Be Cheerful", which returned them to the charts, making the UK Top 10. Jankel was replaced by former [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]] guitarist [[Wilko Johnson]], who also contributed to the next album ''[[Laughter (Ian Dury & The Blockheads album)|Laughter]]'' (1980) and its two hit singles, although Gallagher recalls that the recording of the ''Laughter'' album was difficult and that Dury was drinking heavily in this period.<ref name="pennyblack"/>

In 1980–81 Dury and Jankel teamed up again with [[Sly and Robbie]] and the [[Compass Point All Stars]] to record ''[[Lord Upminster]]'' (1981). The Blockheads toured the UK and Europe throughout 1981, sometimes augmented by jazz trumpeter [[Don Cherry (jazz)|Don Cherry]], ending the year with their only tour of Australia.<ref name="Blockheads official website">{{cite web |url=http://www.theblockheads.com/biog.php |title=Blockheads official website |publisher=Theblockheads.com |access-date=30 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509084204/http://www.theblockheads.com/biog.php |archive-date=9 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
The Blockheads disbanded in early 1982 after Dury secured a new recording deal with [[Polydor Records]] through A&R man Frank Neilson. Choosing to work with a group of young musicians which he named the Music Students, he recorded the album ''Four Thousand Weeks' Holiday''. This album marked a departure from his usual style and was not as well received by fans for its American jazz influence.

The Blockheads briefly reformed in June 1987 to play a short tour of Japan, and then disbanded again. In September 1990, following the death from cancer of drummer Charley Charles, they reunited for two benefit concerts in aid of Charles' family, held at [[The Forum, London|The Forum]], [[Camden Town]], with [[Steven Monti]] on drums. In December 1990, augmented by Merlin Rhys-Jones on guitar and Will Parnell on percussion, they recorded the live album ''Warts & Audience'' at the [[Brixton Academy]].<ref name="Blockheads official website"/>

The Blockheads (minus Jankel, who returned to California) toured Spain in January 1991, then disbanded again until August 1992 when, following Jankel's return to England, they were invited to reform for the [[Madstock!]] Festival in [[Finsbury Park]];<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/ian-dury-and-the-blockheads/1992/finsbury-park-london-england-13ddf5d9.html |title=Ian Dury & The Blockheads Setlist |publisher=Setlist.fm |access-date=18 June 2018 |archive-date=19 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619140124/https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/ian-dury-and-the-blockheads/1992/finsbury-park-london-england-13ddf5d9.html |url-status=live }}</ref> this was followed by sporadic gigs in Europe, Ireland, the UK and Japan in late 1994 and 1995.<ref name="Blockheads official website"/> In the early 1990s, Dury appeared with English band [[Curve (band)|Curve]] on the benefit compilation album ''[[Peace Together]]''. Dury and Curve singer [[Toni Halliday]] shared vocals on a cover of the Blockheads' track "What a Waste".

In March 1996 Dury was diagnosed with cancer and, after recovering from an operation, he set about writing another album. In late 1996 he reunited with the Blockheads to record the album ''[[Mr. Love Pants]]'' (1997). Ian Dury & the Blockheads resumed touring, with Dylan Howe replacing Steven Monti on drums. Davey Payne left the group permanently in August and was replaced by [[Gilad Atzmon]]; this line-up gigged throughout 1999, culminating in their last performance with Ian Dury on 6 February 2000 at the [[London Palladium]]. Dury died six weeks later on 27 March 2000.<ref name="Blockheads official website"/>

The Blockheads have continued after Dury's death, contributing to the tribute album ''Brand New Boots And Panties'', then ''Where's The Party''. The Blockheads currently comprise Jankel, Watt-Roy, Gallagher, Turnbull, John Roberts on drums, Gilad Atzmon and Dave Lewis on saxes. Derek The Draw (who was Dury's friend and minder) is now writing songs with Jankel as well as singing. [[Lee Harris (guitarist)|Lee Harris]] is their '[[aide de camp]]'.

====Roger Daltrey====
In 1984, Dury was featured in the music video for the minor hit single "[[Walking in My Sleep]]" by [[Roger Daltrey]] of [[The Who]].

===Spasticus Autisticus===
Dury's 1981 song "[[Spasticus Autisticus]]"{{snd}} written to show his disdain for that year's [[International Year of Disabled Persons]], which he saw as patronising and counter-productive{{snd}} was banned by the [[BBC]]. Dury was a disabled person himself, having been left crippled by childhood polio. The lyrics were uncompromising:
<poem>
    So place your hard-earned peanuts in my tin
    And thank the Creator you're not in the state I'm in
    So long have I been languished on the shelf
    I must give all proceedings to myself</poem>
The song's refrain, "I'm spasticus, autisticus", was inspired by the response of the rebellious Roman [[gladiator]]s in the film ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'', who, when instructed to identify their leader, all answered, "I am [[Spartacus]]", to protect him. According to Professor George McKay, in a 2009 article in ''Popular Music'' called 'Crippled with nerves' (an early Dury song title):

{{quote|Ian Dury, that 'flaw of the jungle', produced a remarkable and sustained body of work that explored issues of disability, in both personal and social contexts, institutionalisation, and to a lesser extent the pop cultural tradition of disability. He also, with the single "Spasticus Autisticus" (1981), produced one of the outstanding protest songs about the place of disabled people in what he called 'normal land'.<ref>{{cite journal |first=George |last=McKay |date=2009 |url=http://usir.salford.ac.uk/2372/1/displayFulltext.pdf |title='Crippled with nerves': popular music and polio, with particular reference to Ian Dury |journal=Popular Music |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=341–365 |doi=10.1017/S0261143009990109 |s2cid=161590800 |access-date=12 June 2018 |archive-date=16 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916101509/http://usir.salford.ac.uk/2372/1/displayFulltext.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>}}

Dury described the song as "a war cry" on ''[[Desert Island Discs]]''. The song was banned from being broadcast by the [[BBC]] before 6 p.m. when it first came out; it was later used at the opening of the [[London 2012 Paralympics]].

===Acting and other activities===
[[File:Ian Dury2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Dury in concert]]
Dury's confident and unusual demeanour caught the eyes of producers and directors of drama. His first important and extensive role was in [[Farrukh Dhondy]]'s mini-series for the BBC ''[[King of the Ghetto]]'' (1986), a drama set in London's multi-racial [[Brick Lane]] area with a cast led by a young [[Tim Roth]].

Dury had small parts in several films, probably the best known of which was [[Peter Greenaway]]'s
''[[The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover]]'' (1989), as well as a [[cameo role|cameo appearance]] in [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[Pirates (1986 film)|Pirates]]'' (1986). He also appeared in the [[Eduardo Guedes]] film '' Rocinante'' (1986), [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]'s ''[[The Rainbow Thief]]'' (1990), and the [[Sylvester Stallone]] science fiction film ''[[Judge Dredd (film)|Judge Dredd]]'' (1995). His other film appearances included roles in ''Number One'' (1985) starring [[Bob Geldof]], the [[Bob Hoskins]] film ''[[The Raggedy Rawney]]'' (1988), and ''[[Split Second (1992 film)|Split Second]]'' (1992) starring [[Rutger Hauer]] and [[Kim Cattrall]]. He also appeared alongside fellow lyricists [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Tom Waits]], respectively, in the movies ''[[Hearts of Fire]]'' (1987) and ''Bearskin: An Urban Fairytale'' (1990), also by Eduardo Guedes.<ref>{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Willemen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/oct/17/guardianobituaries.filmnews1 |title=Obituary: Eduardo Guedes |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=17 October 2000 |access-date=12 June 2018 |archive-date=12 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612145118/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/oct/17/guardianobituaries.filmnews1 |url-status=live }}</ref> His later films included the comedy ''[[Different for Girls (film)|Different for Girls]]'' (1996), and ''[[The Crow: City of Angels]]'' (1996), directed by [[Tim Pope]], who had directed a few of Dury's music videos.

Dury also wrote a musical, ''Apples'', staged in London's [[Royal Court Theatre]]. In 1987 he appeared as the narrator (Scullery) in ''[[Road (play)|Road]]'', also at the Royal Court. Among the cast was actress and singer [[Jane Horrocks]], who cohabited with Dury until late in 1988, although the relationship was kept discreet.<ref>Balls, Richard (2000), pp. 264–6</ref>

Dury wrote and performed the theme song "Profoundly in Love with Pandora" for the television series ''[[The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole (TV series)|The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13¾]]'' (1985), based on the book of the same name by [[Sue Townsend]], as well as its follow-up, ''[[The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole (TV series)|The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole]]'' (1987). Dury turned down an offer from [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] to write the libretto for ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' (from which [[Richard Stilgoe]] reportedly earned millions).

When AIDS first came to prominence in the mid-1980s, Dury was among celebrities who appeared on UK television to promote [[safe sex]], demonstrating how to put on a [[condom]] using a model of an erect penis. In the 1990s, he became an ambassador for [[UNICEF]], recruiting stars such as [[Robbie Williams]] to publicise the cause. The two visited [[Sri Lanka]] in this capacity to promote polio [[vaccination]]. Dury appeared with [[Curve (band)|Curve]] on the ''[[Peace Together]]'' concert and CD (1993), performing "What a Waste", with benefits to the Youth of Northern Ireland.

Dury appeared in the ''[[Classic Albums]]'' episode that focused on [[Steely Dan]]'s album ''[[Aja (album)|Aja]]''. Dury commented that the album was one of the most "upful" he had ever heard, and that the album "lifted [his] spirits up" whenever he played it.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/jun/05/artsfeatures.popandrock2 |title=Eggheads of rock |first=John L |last=Walters |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=5 June 2003 |access-date=12 June 2018 |archive-date=12 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612143552/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/jun/05/artsfeatures.popandrock2 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Dury married Elizabeth "Betty" Rathmell (born 12 August 1942, [[Leamington Spa]], Warwickshire), on 3 June 1967 and they had two children, Jemima (born 4 January 1969, [[Hounslow]], Greater London) and [[Baxter Dury|Baxter]] (born 18 December 1971, [[Wingrave]], Buckinghamshire, England).<ref name=iandury>{{cite web |url=http://www.iandury.com/Biography/ |title=Ian Dury&nbsp;– a brief biography |publisher=www.iandury.com |access-date=16 February 2010 |archive-date=11 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111052730/http://www.iandury.com/Biography/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Dury divorced Rathmell in 1985, but remained on good terms. He cohabited with a young woman named Denise Roudette<ref name="iandury"/> for six years after he moved to London, [[squatting]] at [[Oval Mansions]] in [[Kennington]], which ''[[The Guardian]]'' referred to as "one of London's most notorious squatted buildings" and Dury himself dubbed "Catshit Mansions" while writing "most of his best songs there" according to ''The Guardian''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/sep/03/criminalising-squatters-hurts-british-music |title=Criminalising squatters will hurt British pop music |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=28 December 2013 |archive-date=31 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731104142/https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/sep/03/criminalising-squatters-hurts-british-music |url-status=live }}</ref> He also had two children, Bill and Albert, with another girlfriend, sculptor Sophy Tilson.<ref name=DuNoyer/>

===Illness and death===
It was known for some time before his death that Dury had cancer.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}} He was diagnosed with [[colorectal cancer]] in 1996 and underwent surgery, but tumours were later found in his liver, and he was told that his condition was terminal. Upon learning of his illness, Dury and Sophy Tilson got married.<ref name=DuNoyer>{{cite web |url=http://www.pauldunoyer.com/pages/journalism/journalism_item.asp?journalismID=338 |title=Ian Dury: Ambivalent Recollections |first=Paul |last=Du Noyer |publisher=pauldunoyer.com |date=29 September 2012 |access-date=9 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613095545/http://www.pauldunoyer.com/pages/journalism/journalism_item.asp?journalismID=338 |archive-date=13 June 2013 }}</ref>

In 1998, his death was [[List of premature obituaries|incorrectly announced]] on [[XFM]] radio by [[Bob Geldof]], possibly due to hoax information from a listener.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/500829/geldof-falsely-reports-dury-death/|title=Geldof Falsely Reports Dury Death|date=27 August 1998|newspaper=MTV News|access-date=3 December 2016|archive-date=20 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220032144/http://www.mtv.com/news/500829/geldof-falsely-reports-dury-death/|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1999, Dury collaborated with [[Madness (band)|Madness]] on their first original album in fourteen years on the track "[[Drip Fed Fred]]". [[Suggs (singer)|Suggs]] and the band cite him as a great influence. It was to be one of his last recordings. He also performed again with the Blockheads in mid-1999 at [[Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club|Ronnie Scott's]] in Soho. This was a special performance recorded for LWT's ''South Bank Show'' and the audience were invited fans and friends of the band and crew. His deteriorating condition was evident and he had to take rests between takes and be helped on and off stage.

Ian Dury & the Blockheads' last public performance was a charity concert in aid of Cancer BACUP on 6 February 2000 at the [[London Palladium]], supported by [[Kirsty MacColl]] and [[Phill Jupitus]]. Dury was noticeably ill and again had to be helped on and off stage.

Dury died of metastatic colorectal cancer on 27 March 2000, aged 57. An obituary in ''[[The Guardian]]'' called him "one of few true originals of the English music scene".<ref name="G270300"/> Meanwhile, he was described by Suggs as "possibly the finest lyricist we've seen". The Ian Dury website opened an online [[condolence book|book of condolence]] shortly after his death, which was signed by hundreds of fans. He was cremated following a [[Religious humanism|humanist]] funeral at [[Golders Green Crematorium]] with 250 mourners at the service, including fellow musicians Suggs and [[Jools Holland]] as well as other "celebrity fans" such as [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) [[Mo Mowlam]].

In 2002 a "musical bench" designed by Mil Stricevic was placed in a favoured viewing spot of Dury's near [[Richmond Park#James Thomson|Poets' Corner]],<!-- NOT Poets' corner as is named after only one poet, James Thomson - see Richmond Park article--> in the gardens of [[Pembroke Lodge]], in [[Richmond Park]], south-west London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milstricevic.net/pages/reasons.html/ |title=Reasons To Be Cheerful 2000 |access-date=12 June 2018 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203020714/http://www.milstricevic.net/pages/reasons.html |archive-date=3 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The back of the bench is inscribed with the words "[[Reasons to Be Cheerful, Part 3|Reasons to be cheerful]]", the title of one of Dury's songs.<ref name="Monuments">{{cite web | url=http://www.royalparks.org.uk/press/factsheets-on-the-royal-parks/monuments/monuments-in-richmond-park | title=Monuments in Richmond Park | publisher=[[The Royal Parks]] | access-date=8 October 2012 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204220436/http://www.royalparks.org.uk/press/factsheets-on-the-royal-parks/monuments/monuments-in-richmond-park | archive-date=4 February 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> This [[solar power]]ed seat was intended to allow visitors to plug in and listen to eight of his songs as well as an interview.<ref name="bench">{{cite web | url=http://www.ukseries.com/blog/2010/08/the-ian-jury-musical-bench-in-richmond-park/ | title=The Ian Dury Musical Bench in Richmond Park | publisher=UK Travel Blog | first=Trevor | last=Hartley | date=27 August 2010 | access-date=7 October 2012 | archive-date=15 November 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115100407/http://www.ukseries.com/blog/2010/08/the-ian-jury-musical-bench-in-richmond-park/ | url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1999 the autobiographical documentary ''On My Life'', directed by Mike Connolly, was released.

A musical, ''Reasons to be Cheerful'', was produced by the [[Graeae Theatre Company]] in association with [[Theatre Royal Stratford East]] and [[New Wolsey Theatre]].

Interviewed by the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' in 2010, son Baxter said his father "was like a "[[Polaris missile]]"... "He would seek out someone's weakness in seconds, and then lock onto it. That's how he controlled his environment. It was very funny, in a gruesome kind of way ... if it wasn't you he was picking on. But it was a strange obsession, too. Like, why do you want to be like that? He was never really physically violent{{snd}} he was a small disabled guy{{snd}} but there was a lot of mental violence."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/enduring-dad-the-truth-about-ian-dury-by-his-son-6701525.html|title=Enduring dad: The truth about Ian Dury, by his son|date=12 January 2010|website=Evening Standard|access-date=21 July 2019|archive-date=21 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721113339/https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/enduring-dad-the-truth-about-ian-dury-by-his-son-6701525.html|url-status=live}}</ref>
