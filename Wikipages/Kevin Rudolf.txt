'''Kevin Winston Rudolf''' (born February 17, 1983) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, rapper, and multi-instrumentalist from [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. He is best known for his 2008 single "[[Let It Rock (Kevin Rudolf song)|Let It Rock]]".

==Early life==
Kevin Winston Rudolf was born on February 17, 1983, in [[New York City, New York]], to Ellyn, an [[United States|American]] singer, and Stephen, a [[disc jockey]] originally from the [[United Kingdom]] and of [[English people|English]] extraction.  He grew up an only child on the [[Upper East Side]], his parents divorcing while he was still very young.

Rudolf has said that his first musical memory is of listening to the [[Van Halen]] song "[[Jump (Van Halen song)|Jump]]", while jumping around the apartment in which he grew up.<ref name="Clash Q&A">{{Cite news|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/kevin-rudolf|title=Kevin Rudolf-Clash Q&A|date=January 13, 2009|work=Clashmusic|access-date=May 25, 2013}}</ref> His skills on the instrument improved rapidly. "My mother actually said something really smart to me.  She said, 'Whatever you put in, you'll get out,' so I thought, that makes sense...I started practicing a lot."<ref name="Global Grind">{{Cite news|url=http://globalgrind.com/music/kevin-rudolf-signed-cash-money-interview|title=Kevin Rudolf: "Who Would've Thought I Would End Up On Cash Money?"

Rudolf played with several local bands, including an [[alternative rock]] group known as 'Paint', but soon found himself frustrated with the tensions and internal squabbles associated with a band situation. Taking matters into his own hands, Rudolf began creating his own beats and musical tracks, as well as writing the material.<ref name="Global Grind" />

==Musical career==

===2000–2006: Career beginnings===

In 2000, Rudolf began work on the group of songs that, nine months later, would form the basis for his [[major label]] debut.  Written, produced and engineered by Rudolf, and mixed by Mark Saunders, the album took nine months to complete.<ref name=Rovi-Binocular>Bonacich, Drago (2003). {{cite web |url=http://www.allrovi.com/name/binocular-mn0000771257 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-05-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130628104424/http://www.allrovi.com/name/binocular-mn0000771257 |archive-date=2013-06-28 }} Allrovi.com. Retrieved May 26, 2013</ref> Rudolf was signed to [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s record label, [[Maverick Records|Maverick]], which released the album under the [[pseudonym]], ''Binocular''. A song from the album, "You", was used in the TV show ''[[Smallville]]'' (2001), and a song not appearing on the album, "Maybe You're Gone" (written by Danny Scherr), was later used over the end credits of the movie "[[The Girl Next Door (2004 film)|The Girl Next Door]]" (2004).<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265208/soundtrack]  imdb.com.  Retrieved June 3, 2013.</ref> Despite receiving positive reviews, the album went largely unnoticed in the United States.<ref>Allmusic (2009). However, it was successful in the Philippines.

Rudolf's solo career took a detour in 2003, when recording engineer [[Jimmy Douglass]] introduced him to producer [[Timbaland]]. Rudolf was invited to watch a recording session, but, at Timbaland's urging, soon found himself participating, by playing guitar on [[Lil' Kim]]'s 2003 hit "[[The Jump Off]]." Rudolf remembers, "At first I just went into the studio to absorb what I could. I brought my guitar as sort of peace offering so I wasn't feeling completely useless. Soon I was playing parts on songs." Rudolf has stated that his time spent with Timbaland influenced his own attitude in making records. "Working with Timbaland, I was amazed by his work ethic and just how much he would work on something until he got the results he wanted."<ref name="Life in LA">{{Cite news|url=http://lifeinla.com/5237/202/KEVIN+RUDOLF+EXPOSED.html|title=Kevin Rudolf Exposed|date=June 19, 2010|work=Lifeinla.com|access-date=June 2, 2013}}</ref> He would go on to collaborate with Timbaland on many songs, including those by The [[Black Eyed Peas]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Nelly Furtado]], and [[David Banner]].<ref name="Clash Q&A"/>

===2007–2009: Major label success===
Rudolf continued to work on his solo material throughout 2007, while still working with Timbaland.  During one memorable session, he met [[Birdman (rapper)|Bryan "Birdman" Williams]] and [[Ronald "Slim" Williams]], brothers and co-CEO's of [[Cash Money Records]].  "I played them a couple of records I produced and wrote and they liked them for one of their artists. Then I played them my solo stuff and they flipped out over this song called 'Coffee and Donuts'. We built from there, and a few months later Lil Wayne got on '[[Let It Rock (Kevin Rudolf song)|Let It Rock]]' and they signed me, and the rest is history."<ref name="Clash Q&A" />

When Rudolf was signed to a record deal by Cash Money, he became the first white artist, as well as the first rock artist, signed to a label previously known for releasing records by African-American rap artists, including, most famously, [[Lil Wayne]]. CEO Slim Williams explained, "we love one-of-a-kind artists, and Kevin rolls that way in everything he does...we are always looking at the next step, the next level we can take our audience. I knew his work with other artists, but when he played me his solo stuff, we just knew we had to partner up."<ref name="Ask Men KevinRudolf">{{Cite news|url=http://www.askmen.com/celebs/men/entertainment/kevin-rudolf|title=Kevin Rudolf|date=October 13, 2012|work=Askmen|access-date=May 27, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131117160746/http://www.askmen.com/celebs/men/entertainment/kevin-rudolf/|archive-date=2013-11-17}}</ref>

 |filename =  |title="Let It Rock"|description="Let It Rock" was the first single from ''[[In the City (Kevin Rudolf album)|In the City]]'' (2008).}}
"[[Let It Rock (Kevin Rudolf song)|Let It Rock]]", the initial single from Rudolf's then-upcoming album, ''[[In the City (Kevin Rudolf album)|In the City]]'', was released on June 16, 2008. Written and produced by Rudolf, and featuring Lil Wayne, the song met with immediate success, debuting at number 5 on [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' magazine]]'s influential [[Hot 100]] chart.<ref name="KevinRudolf">{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1043745/kevin-rudolf-featuring-lil-wayne-let-it-rock|title=Kevin Rudolf featuring Lil Wayne, "Let It Rock"|date=July 2008|work=billboard.com|access-date=May 27, 2013}}</ref>  Noted music critic David Jeffries predicted that fans would find the song "a near-perfect highlight,"<ref name="In the city review">{{Cite news|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,4855267,00.html|title=In the city review|date=January 12, 2008|first=David|last=Jeffries|work=Artistdirect|access-date=May 27, 2013}}</ref> while critic Rick Florino called Rudolf's voice "sexy and bombastic" and noted his "diverse set of pipes."<ref name="In the city review"/> The song became a staple of sporting events, listed by [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] as the second most-played song in NFL, MLB and NHL arenas and stadiums.<ref name="Songsfacts">{{Cite news|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=12967|title=Let it Rock by Kevin Rudolf Songfacts|date=October 1, 2008|work=Songfacts|access-date=May 28, 2013}}</ref>

With "Let It Rock" already a massive hit, fans and media still noted a sense of "mystery" surrounding Rudolf. "There really was no mystery," he said. "The song just blew up faster than we could catch up with it. But it was great that the music was given a chance to speak for itself. People truly felt it--it wasn't anything fake. And with me, music always comes first. Unlike some artists, I don't want the attention to be put on myself as much as my music."<ref name="Life in LA" />

Rudolf's first studio album, titled ''[[In the City (Kevin Rudolf album)|In the City]]'', was released on November 24, 2008, and was produced and co-written by Rudolf, with the exception of one song, "She Can Get It", which was co-produced by [[the Neptunes]]. Rudolf explained that the album was about "growing up in [[New York City]] when the city was wild... it felt like there were no rules and you could be anyone you wanted. That is the landscape of this album."<ref name="Ask Men KevinRudolf" />
The album was noted for Rudolf's distinctive merging of musical styles, namely, rock and hip-hop. "It's about taking rock attitude vocally, hip hop drums, synths, and guitars and sharpening the edges of everything in a sense. You bring it together. That's how I do it."<ref name="Artist Direct">{{Cite news|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/entertainment-news/article/kevin-rudolf-talks-don-t-give-up-favorite-rock-bands-and-more/10124706|title=Kevin Rudolf talks Don't Give Up|date=June 4, 2012|work=Artistdirect|access-date=June 2, 2013}}</ref>

Rudolf's penchant for "genre-bending" was noted in many reviews of the album.  "'In the City' cribs tricks from both rap and rock 'n' roll, not in the pursuit of a bastardised [[Limp Bizkit]]-type hybrid, but with the intention to produce a crossover rock record with modern hip-hop tools...it's hard to deny Rudolf is a man with some big ideas."<ref name="BBC Review">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/fwgb|title= BBC - Review of Kevin Rudolf|date=December 12, 2008|work=BBC|access-date=May 31, 2013}}</ref>

With lead single "Let It Rock" still garnering the most attention, other songs from the album also began to have impact. "[[Welcome to the World]]", the album's second single, went gold and was featured prominently in advertisements for [[WrestleMania XXVI]].<ref name="RIAA singles">{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Kevin%20Rudolf&format=SINGLE&go=Search&perPage=50|title=RIAA – Gold & Platinum – September 4, 2010: Kevin Rudolf certified singles|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|access-date=September 4, 2010}}</ref><ref name="billboard1">[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=kevin rudolf|chart=Bubbling Under Hot 100}} Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles]</ref><ref>[http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?key=566549&cat=s Australian-charts.com - Welcome to the World - Kevin Rudolf featuring Kid Cudi - Chart positions]</ref> "NYC" was featured on an episode of ''[[CSI: NY]]''.<ref>{{cite episode| title = Enough| episode-link = Enough (CSI: NY)| series = CSI: NY| series-link = CSI: NY| airdate = 2008-11-05| season = 5| number = 6}}</ref>

Throughout most of 2009, Rudolf performed songs from ''In the City'' live, including appearances on ''[[The Jimmy Kimmel Show]]'', ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'', the [[Miss USA Pageant]] and the 2009 [[NBA All-Star Game]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.in.com/kevin-rudolf/biography-334900.html|title=Kevin Rudolf Biography|date=November 5, 2010|work=in.com|access-date=May 31, 2013}}{{dead link|date=April 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

===2010–2014: ''To the Sky''===
On June 15, 2010, Rudolf's second studio album, ''[[To the Sky]]'', was released. The album consists of 11 tracks with a total running time of 37 minutes. The first single from the album, "[[I Made It (Cash Money Heroes)]]", was released on February 2, 2010, in advance of the album, becoming Rudolf's second [[platinum single]].<ref name="RIAA singles" /> It was followed, on September 14, by the single "[[You Make the Rain Fall]]." Critical reviews were mixed, with one saying, "this is '[[In the City (Kevin Rudolf album)|In the City]]' evolved...to a higher level,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2010_06_rudolftothesky.html|title=Kevin Rudolf: To the Sky|publisher=rapreviews.com|date=June 8, 2010|access-date=June 1, 2013}}</ref> while others noted the "good songwriting," but lamented that "without a worthy '[[Let It Rock (Kevin Rudolf song)|Let it Rock]]' successor, this is hard to recommend over his debut."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/to-the-sky-mw0001998754|title=Kevin Rudolf: To the Sky Review|publisher=allmusic.com|date=June 10, 2010|access-date=June 1, 2013}}</ref>

Responding to a question about his song, "[[I Made It (Cash Money Heroes)|I Made It]]", Rudolf elaborated on his own feelings regarding success.  "I think that 'making it' is something that you do in stages. There's a certain feeling of 'I made it' when you have a hit on the radio for the first time and people are feeling it and buying it and reacting to it at shows. But I've also set new goals since then."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/the-beat-goes-on/posts/hitfix-interview-kevin-rudolf-talks-new-album-lil-wayne-rivers-cuomo-and-lifehouse|title=Kevin Rudolf: The Interview|publisher=hitfix.com|date=June 16, 2010|access-date=June 1, 2013}}</ref>

On July 2, 2013, [[Perez Hilton]] premiered Rudolf's video for his upcoming single, "Here's to Us."  Hilton stated, "'Here's To Us' will be the lead single off his upcoming third album. We seriously got goosebumps watching this video! It has such a positive message. We just LOVE Kevin's outlook on life!" On July 26, Rudolf announced via his official Twitter page that the single, "Here's to Us" would be available on iTunes as of Tuesday, July 30.<ref name="Kevin Rudolf">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/itsKevinRudolf|title=Here's to Us Will be Released on Tuesday on iTunes!!|last=Rudolf|first=Kevin|work=[[Twitter.com/itskevinrudolf]]|publisher=Twitter|access-date=July 27, 2013}}</ref> The song was also featured on the soundtrack of the video game ''[[2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil (video game)|2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil]]''.<ref name="FIFA Brazil">{{cite web|url=http://www.easports.com/2014-fifa-world-cup/news-updates-gameplay/article/ea-sports-2014-fifa-world-cup-soundtrack|title=EA SPORTS 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil Soundtrack Reveal|work=EA Sports|publisher=easports.com|access-date=June 27, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407101819/http://www.easports.com/2014-fifa-world-cup/news-updates-gameplay/article/ea-sports-2014-fifa-world-cup-soundtrack|archive-date=April 7, 2014}}</ref>

===2015–present: ''Space Rock''===
On January 13, 2015, Kevin Rudolf announced that he had completed his contract with Cash Money Records and now he was an independent artist.<ref name="Free Man from Cash Money">{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/kevinrudolf/status/555113578156789760|title=Free Man from Cash Money|date=Jan 2015|work=Twitter|access-date=May 27, 2015}}</ref> After being relaxed out of his record deal with Cash Money Records in January 2015, Rudolf could no longer release music under his own name for a period of three years, therefore Rudolf created a new project under the alias Space Rock.<ref name="Space Rock">{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/spacerockmusic/info?tab=page_info|title=About Space Rock|work=Space Rock|publisher=easports.com|access-date=June 27, 2015}}</ref>

After signing with [[Primary Wave Music]] in July 2015, Kevin dropped the name Space Rock and went back to Kevin Rudolf using ''Space Rock'' as the album title instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Kevin-Rudolf-Signs-with-Primary-Wave-Releases-New-Single-20150710|title=Kevin Rudolf Signs with Primary Wave, Releases New Single|author=BWW News Desk}}</ref> On May 21, 2015, Kevin released the first single from ''Space Rock'', titled "That Other Ship".

On June 22, 2015, Kevin released a song called 'Blaze Of Glory', featured on the WWE Tough Enough soundtrack.

On July 7, 2017, Rudolf released the single 'Nobody Gets Out Alive'.

===Production work===
In September 2009, having finished two solo albums, Rudolf moved from [[Miami]] to [[Los Angeles]] to concentrate on co-writing and producing records for several LA-based artists, including Amanda Kay (now [[Ava Max]]), [[Cobra Starship]], [[Leona Lewis]], [[Lifehouse (band)|Lifehouse]], [[Natasha Bedingfield]], [[Selena Gomez]] and [[Weezer]].<ref name="AAMINC">{{cite web|url=http://www.aaminc.com/category.php?cat=3&id=62|title=Kevin Rudolf|last=Kipnis|first=Andy|publisher=AAMINC|access-date=May 22, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810120223/http://aaminc.com/category.php?cat=3&id=62|archive-date=August 10, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> 
"I spent a lot of time in L.A. after a couple of my records blew up, and I got into producing and writing for a lot of other artists out there. I got into that whole game. Then when I got back to New York—I grew up in New York—I felt completely inspired all over again. I felt like I had done enough of writing songs for other people, that I wanted to really say something. I think what music's lacking right now is there's really no message. No one's saying anything...I just felt like I really wanted to put something back in the world that inspires people, says something, and means something."<ref name="YRB">{{Cite news|url=http://www.yrbmagazine.com/yrb-interview-kevin-rudolf|title=YRB Interview: Kevin Rudolf|date=November 5, 2012|first=Loriana|last=Yaport|work=YRB|access-date=June 2, 2013}}</ref>

In 2013, Rudolf took a break from recording his own album to co-write a song with country artist [[Keith Urban]] and country songwriters Brad and Brett Warren called "[[Little Bit of Everything (song)|Little Bit of Everything]]", which Urban debuted on May 16, 2013, on the Season 12 finale of ''[[American Idol]]''.<ref name="Music Row">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicrow.com/2013/05/keith-urban-to-perform-new-single-on-american-idol-finale/|title=Keith Urban to Perform New Single on 'American Idol' Finale|last=Nicholson|first=Jessica|publisher=Music Row|access-date=May 22, 2013}}</ref>

==Personal life==

[[File:Kevin Rudolf, Miami 2013.JPG|thumb|Kevin Rudolf, Miami 2013]]

Having grown up in [[New York City]], the only child of divorced parents, Rudolf has stated that he has found greater inspiration and a stronger sense of belonging in his adopted city of [[Miami]]. Rudolf first lived temporarily in Miami while doing session work with producer [[Timbaland]]. After relocating to Los Angeles in 2010 while writing and producing for several artists, Rudolf returned to New York for a brief time in 2012 to begin work on his upcoming album, then moved permanently to Miami.<ref name="Huffington Post">{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-ragogna/lp-music_b_1463462.html|title=Kevin Rudolf's Exclusive EPK|last=Ragogna|first=Mike|work=Huffington Post|access-date=June 2, 2013}}</ref>
