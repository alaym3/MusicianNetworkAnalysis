'''Warzone''' (formerly known as '''Rat Poison''')<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rettman |first1=Tony |title=Racist Skins Weren't Welcome in Warzone's LES War Zone |url=https://clrvynt.com/racist-skins-werent-welcome-in-warzones-les-war-zone/ |access-date=July 12, 2020}}</ref> was an American [[hardcore punk]] band formed on the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]] in 1983. The band helped develop the [[New York hardcore]] sound, the [[hardcore skinhead]] style and the [[youth crew]] subgenre. During the band's 14 years and many line-up changes, their primarily hardcore sound was flavored by influences ranging from [[Oi!]] (they toured several times with [[The Business (band)|The Business]] and played a cover of their song "The Real Enemy") to traditional [[punk rock]] to [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] (on their self-titled LP). Their fan base was diverse, with their concerts usually attended by skinheads, [[straight edge]] teens, metalheads, and punks of all ages. [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] has written that "one could argue that [Warzone] spearheaded the second and larger wave of hardcore bands that erupted in the NY scene in 1986-1987".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/warzone-women|title=Brotherhood and Sisterhood: Looking Back with New York Hardcore's Warzone Women|date=June 10, 2015|website=Noisey.vice.com|access-date=October 27, 2018}}</ref>

Frontman Raymond "Raybeez" Barbieri was the band's only consistent member through the vast majority of its years. He joined the band as the drummer in 1983 (the same year he played drums on the debut [[Agnostic Front]] 7" EP ''[[United Blood]]''), later taking over vocal duties<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.unityhxc.com/hardcore/raybeez.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-09-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031063404/http://www.unityhxc.com/hardcore/raybeez.htm |archive-date=2014-10-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref> after Warzone had already been in existence for two years (noting later, "in a band that [had] been running for so long, there has to be something there").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revelationrecords.com/band/179|title=Revelation Records : Warzone|website=Revelationrecords.com|access-date=27 October 2018}}</ref> Raybeez remained the singer of Warzone until his death on September 11, 1997 due to [[pneumonia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1435183/warzones-raybeez-dies-of-pneumonia/|title=Warzone's Raybeez Dies Of Pneumonia|website=Mtv.com|access-date=27 October 2018}}</ref> A [[U.S. Navy]] veteran,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadpunkstars.com/browse/203/raybeez.html|title=Dead Punk Stars † Raybeez † Sep. 11, 1997|first=Andy|last=Ramone|website=Deadpunkstars.com|access-date=27 October 2018}}</ref> he was receiving treatment in a [[Veterans Health Administration|VHA]] facility when the illness damaged his liver and took his life at the age of 35.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ineffecthardcore.com/features/warzone-remembering-raybeez/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-12-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712184159/http://www.ineffecthardcore.com/features/warzone-remembering-raybeez/ |archive-date=2015-07-12 }}</ref> A tribute sign reading "R.I.P Ray" hung outside [[CBGB]] for some time following his death, and for more than a year afterward, every release on [[Victory Records]] was dedicated to his memory, as were two independent compilations. These albums, as well as benefit concerts, raised funds for several non-profit groups Ray had worked for which helped at-risk youth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.punknews.org/bands/warzone|title=Warzone|website=Punknews.org|access-date=October 27, 2018}}</ref>
