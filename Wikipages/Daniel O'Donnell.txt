==Early life==
O'Donnell was born in and brought up in the village of [[Kincasslagh]], in [[The Rosses]] district in the west of [[County Donegal]], Ireland. He grew up as the youngest of a [[Roman Catholic]] family, with his parents, Julia (née McGonagle born 1919; died 18 May 2014)<ref>O'Donnell stated in a [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] interview, ''Up Close and Personal with Daniel O'Donnell'', screened on Friday 13 March 2009, that his mother would be 90 later that year.</ref> and Francis O'Donnell, and siblings John (the eldest), Margaret ([[Margo (singer)|Margo]]), Kathleen and James. He has described his upbringing as mostly happy, with the exception of the death of his father after a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] when O'Donnell was six years old.

During his school years, O'Donnell considered pursuing a career in [[bank]]ing. Despite this, a career in music was also always a possibility. As a youngster, O'Donnell performed in the local religious [[choir]]. In 1980, he went to [[Galway]] to pursue [[business studies]], however, he never settled down and by [[Christmas]] he was in his sister [[Margo (music)|Margo]]'s band. Margo had already forged a successful career in Ireland.

==Career==
===Rise to fame===
Not getting enough opportunities to perform solos with the band, in 1983 O'Donnell decided to record his own record. On 9 February 1983, he recorded his first single, [[Johnny McCauley]]'s "My Donegal Shore", with [[Irish pound|£]]1,200 of his own money, selling all the copies himself. Later that year, he formed his own musical group, Country Fever. After the group disbanded, he formed The Grassroots. In 1985, the manager of the Ritz label, Mick Clerkin, saw him perform and introduced him to Sean Reilly, who remains as his manager to this day.

Under the management of Reilly, O'Donnell started to sell concerts out in [[England]] on a regular basis. According to O'Donnell, by January 1992, he had hit rock bottom with [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]]. After a three-month recovery break, he returned to the stage, this time at the [[Point Theatre]], [[Dublin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emusic.com/artist/Daniel-O-Donnell-MP3-Download/11776956.html |title=Daniel O'Donnell music downloads, Daniel O'Donnell songs |publisher=eMusic.com |access-date=25 August 2011}}</ref>

===Success===
By the mid-1990s, O'Donnell had become a household name across [[Ireland]] and [[Great Britain]]. He appeared on popular television shows in both countries and won various awards. Among the accolades, O'Donnell was named Donegal Person of the Year in 1989, which he still rates as the best award. He was given the Irish Entertainer of the Year award in 1989, 1992 and 1996. O'Donnell's first chart hit single in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] was in 1992 with "I Just Want to Dance With You" (later covered by [[George Strait]]). This also led to his first appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''.

During his lengthy career, O'Donnell has made friends with his childhood idols, including [[Cliff Richard]] and [[Loretta Lynn]]. He also forged a close professional relationship with the [[Irish people|Irish]] songstress [[Mary Duff]], who regularly tours with O'Donnell.

O’Donnell had to cancel a series of concerts in Northern Ireland because of death threats from loyalists paramilitary in 1994. The threat was made in a phone call to Daniel O’Donnell's Viking House Hotel in Kincasslagh, County Donegal. The caller said O’Donnell would be killed if he went ahead with four sell out concerts to be held in the Slieve Donard Hotel in Newcastle, County Down.

===2000–present===
In 2002, he was awarded an Honorary (because of his Irish citizenship) [[Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire|MBE]] for his services to the music industry. He has had twenty [[UK]] Top 40 albums as well as fifteen Top 40 singles and has sold 10 million records to date. O'Donnell garnered considerable success in [[North America]], when he starred in seven concert specials on public television stations ([[PBS]]) in the United States. He has charted 18 albums in the Top 20 of the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s World Music Album Chart and also has had several entries in the Independent Albums Chart too.

In 2015, O'Donnell became the first artist to have charted at least one new album in the UK charts for 28 consecutive years (1988–2015), when his latest album ''The Hank Williams Songbook'' entered the UK Artist Albums Chart at number 5.

A Daniel O'Donnell Visitors' Centre was opened in [[Dungloe]] in May, 2012, which displays all his gold discs, awards and wedding suit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/republic-of-ireland/daniel-orsquodonnel-leads-fans-through-his-new-visitorsrsquo-centre-16155662.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120730144322/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/republic-of-ireland/daniel-orsquodonnel-leads-fans-through-his-new-visitorsrsquo-centre-16155662.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-30 |title=Daniel O’Donnel leads fans through his new visitors' centre – Republic of Ireland, Local & National |publisher=Belfasttelegraph.co.uk |date=2012-05-08 |access-date=2012-12-20 }}</ref>

In Autumn 2015, he appeared on ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]''.<ref>''Steve Wright in the Afternoon'', BBC Radio 2, 20 August 2015</ref><ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.evoke.ie/showbiz/daniel-hopes-his-sharp-tongue-wont-be-his-undoing-on-strictly-come-dancing/ |work=evoke.ie | title= Daniel hopes his sharp tongue won't be his undoing on Strictly Come Dancing| date=23 August 2015}}</ref> He was eliminated third; in week 4 of the series.

In October 2015, Daniel and his wife Majella starred in the first series of their TV programme ''Daniel and Majella's B&B Road Trip''. That series aired on [[UTV (TV network)|UTV]] but moved to RTÉ in 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/ten/news/2016/0512/788000-daniel-and-majellas-bb-road-trip-comes-to-rte-one/ |title=Daniel and Majella's B&B Road Trip travels to RTÉ| publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] |date=2016-05-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513112040/http://www.rte.ie/ten/news/2016/0512/788000-daniel-and-majellas-bb-road-trip-comes-to-rte-one/ |archive-date=2016-05-13}}</ref>

O'Donnell is arguably better known for his gentle, soft-spoken personality and clean-cut image, than for his music. Over the years he has attracted vast media attention and there have been many cultural references to the performer. O'Donnell is frequently satirised in Irish and British comedy because of a common supposition that his audience consists mainly of older women.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/daniel-is-shite-geldof-has-no-talent-says-louis-walsh-134107.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120802120044/http://www.independent.ie/national-news/daniel-is-shite-geldof-has-no-talent-says-louis-walsh-134107.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-08-02 |title=Daniel is 'shite', Geldof has no talent, says Louis Walsh – National News |publisher=Independent.ie |date=2006-08-27 |access-date=2012-04-18 }}</ref> He was parodied as celebrity singer "Eoin McLove" in the ''[[Father Ted]]'' episode "[[Night of the Nearly Dead]]", as well as an episode of [[BBC]] sketch-show ''[[Chewin' the Fat]]'', as an Irish singer named "Donald O'Daniel". The comedy show ''[[Bull Island (TV show)|Bull Island]]'' and the radio sketch segment "Gift Grub" portrayed him in sketches frequently singing about his "mammy".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/news/strictly-come-dancing-contestant-daniel-odonnell-we-profile-the-donegal-singer-31558889.html |title=Strictly Come Dancing contestant Daniel O'Donnell: We profile the Donegal singer | work=[[Belfast Telegraph]] DIGITAL |date=2015-09-26 |access-date=2018-06-19}}</ref> DJ [[Chris Moyles]] has parodied O'Donnell on numerous occasions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lyricsmania.com/daniel_odonnell_lyrics_chris_moyles.html |title=Chris Moyles – Daniel O'Donnell Lyrics |publisher=Lyricsmania.com |access-date=2011-08-25}}</ref>

O'Donnell is known for his close relationship with his fans and has a meet-and-greet session after almost every concert. He used to host a massive tea party for his fans outside his Donegal home every year.<ref name="dun-na-ngall.com" /> He has expressed a wish to appear in ''[[Coronation Street]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/ten/2010/1202/odonnelld.html |publisher=RTÉ |title=Daniel O'Donnell wants Corrie role |date=2010-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205012810/http://www.rte.ie/ten/2010/1202/odonnelld.html |archive-date=2010-12-05}}</ref>
