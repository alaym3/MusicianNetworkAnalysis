==Influences==

Although successful, Avant began drawing comparisons to fellow R&B singer [[R. Kelly]] and even faced some backlash from music critics.<ref>https://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/avant</ref>

Avant has cited Kelly as his biggest influence and inspiration. "Being compared to R. Kelly is a compliment in itself. He's been in the game for about twelve years. He is Mr. R&B. To be in the game, and to be named in the same sentence as that man is truly a privilege", Avant said.<ref>https://ratedrnb.com/2013/04/avant-talks-r-kelly-comparisons-making-love-to-his-music-on-sway-in-the-morning/</ref><ref>https://www.rapbasement.com/site/interviews/avant-interview.html</ref>
