==History==
===1962–1968: Formative years===
[[File:Status Quo, 1960s.jpg|thumb|left|"The Status Quo", from a promotional poster for the single "Black Veils of Melancholy" - clockwise from top: Rossi, Coghlan, Parfitt, Lynes, Lancaster]]
Status Quo was formed in 1962 under the name The Scorpions by [[Francis Rossi]] and [[Alan Lancaster]] at [[Sedgehill School|Sedgehill Comprehensive School]], [[Catford]], [[London]], along with classmates Jess Jaworski (keyboards) and Alan Key (drums).<ref name="Status Quo: Just Doin' It!">{{cite book |first=Bob |last=Young |year=2000 |title=Status Quo: Just Doin' It! |edition=1st |publisher=Cassell Illustrated |location=London |page=27 |isbn=1-84403-562-X}}</ref> Rossi and Lancaster played their first gig at the Samuel Jones Sports Club in [[Dulwich]], [[London]]. In 1963, Key was replaced by [[John Coghlan (drummer)|John Coghlan]] and the band changed their name to The Spectres.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/><ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book |first=Martin C. |last=Strong |year=2000 |title=The Great Rock Discography |edition=5th |publisher=Mojo Books |location=Edinburgh |pages=927–929 |isbn=1-84195-017-3}}</ref> After changing their name, Lancaster's father arranged for the group to perform weekly at a venue called the Samuel Jones Sports Club, where they were noticed by Pat Barlow, a [[gasfitter]] and budding [[Talent manager|pop music manager]]. Barlow became the group's manager and secured them spots at venues around London, such as El Partido in [[Lewisham]] and Café des Artistes in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]].<ref name="I Talk Too Much: My Autobiography">{{cite book |last1=Rossi |first1=Francis |title=I Talk Too Much: My Autobiography|publisher=Constable |isbn=978-1472130204 |page=Loc. 544–553 of 4402 (in the Amazon Kindle version) |ref=I Talk Too Much: My Autobiography |date=14 March 2019}}</ref> In 1965, when Rossi, Lancaster and Jaworski left school, Jaworski opted to leave the band and was replaced by [[Roy Lynes]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quoticker.de/SQTICKERUKYEARREVIEW65.htm |title=QUOTICKER - Year review 1965 |website=Quoticker.de |access-date=22 August 2018}}</ref>

They began writing their own material, and later that year met [[Rick Parfitt]] who was playing with a cabaret band called The Highlights. By the end of 1965, Rossi and Parfitt – who had become close friends after meeting at [[Butlins]] – made a commitment to continue working together. On 18 July 1966, the Spectres signed a five-year deal with [[Piccadilly Records]], releasing two singles that year, "[[Hurdy Gurdy Man (The Spectres song)|Hurdy Gurdy Man]]" (written by Alan Lancaster) and "[[I (Who Have Nothing)]]", and one the next year called "[[(We Ain't Got) Nothin' Yet]]" (a song originally recorded by [[New York City|New York]] psychedelic band the [[Blues Magoos]]).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> All three singles failed to make an impact on the [[record chart|charts]].<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/>

By 1967, the group had discovered [[psychedelia]] and named themselves Traffic, but were soon forced to change it to Traffic Jam to avoid confusion with [[Steve Winwood]]'s [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], following an argument over who had registered the name first.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> The band secured an appearance on BBC Radio's ''[[Saturday Club (BBC Radio)|Saturday Club]]'', but in June their next single, "[[Almost But Not Quite There]]", underperformed. The following month saw Parfitt, at the request of manager Pat Barlow, joining the band as rhythm guitarist and vocalist. Shortly after Parfitt's recruitment, in August 1967, the band officially became The Status Quo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quoticker.de/SQTICKERUKYEARREVIEW67.htm |title=QUOTICKER - year review 1967 |website=Quoticker.de |access-date=22 August 2018}}</ref>

===1968–1970: "Pictures of Matchstick Men" and psychedelic years===
In January 1968, the group released the [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]]-flavoured "[[Pictures of Matchstick Men]]".<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> The song hit the [[UK Singles Chart]], reaching number seven; "Matchstick Men" became the group's only Top 40 hit in the United States, peaking at number twelve on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Although Status Quo's albums have been released in the United States throughout their career, they never achieved the same level of success there as they have in Britain.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Though the follow-up was the unsuccessful single "Black Veils of Melancholy", they had a hit again the same year with a pop song penned by [[Marty Wilde]] and [[Ronnie Scott (songwriter)|Ronnie Scott]], "[[Ice in the Sun]]", which climbed to number eight.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> After the breakthrough, the band management hired [[Bob Young (artist)|Bob Young]] as a [[roadie]] and [[tour manager]]. Over the years Young became one of the most important songwriting partners for Status Quo, in addition to playing harmonica with them on stage and on record.

===1970–1981: ''Piledriver'' and ''Rockin' All Over The World''===
[[File:Status Quo1978.jpg|thumb|260px|right|The "Frantic Four" lineup; left-to-right: [[Francis Rossi]], [[Rick Parfitt]] and [[Alan Lancaster]] (obscured: [[John Coghlan (drummer)|John Coghlan]]) performing at the [[Hammersmith Odeon]] in London, 1978]]
After their second album, ''[[Spare Parts (album)|Spare Parts]]'', failed commercially, the band abandoned psychedelia and [[Carnaby Street]] fashions in favour of a [[hard rock]]/[[boogie]] sound, and faded denims and T-shirts, an image which was to become their trademark throughout the 1970s.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> Lynes left the band in 1970 and was replaced in the [[recording studio|studio]] by guests including [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] player Jimmy Horowitz and Tom Parker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quoticker.de/SQTICKERUKYEARREVIEW70.htm|title=QUOTICKER - year review 1970 |website=Quoticker.de|access-date=22 August 2018}}</ref> By 1976, [[Andy Bown]] – an ex-member of [[The Herd (UK band)|The Herd]], [[Judas Jump]] and the Peter Frampton Band – was brought in to cover keyboards, although as he was contracted as a solo artist with [[EMI]] he was not credited as an official member of Status Quo until 1982.

After two relatively poor-selling albums, ''[[Ma Kelly's Greasy Spoon]]'' and ''[[Dog of Two Head]]'' in 1970 and 1971, their major breakthrough came when they signed with the heavy rock and progressive label [[Vertigo Records|Vertigo]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Their first album for Vertigo, ''[[Piledriver (album)|Piledriver]]'', was released in 1972 and heralded an even heavier, self-produced sound.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> This album was essentially the stylistic template for each album they released up to and including ''[[Blue for You]]'' in 1976.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Quo's more popular songs from this era include "[[Paper Plane (song)|Paper Plane]]" (No. 8 in the UK chart) (1972), "[[Caroline (Status Quo song)|Caroline]]" (No. 5 in the UK chart) (1973), "[[Break the Rules (Status Quo song)|Break The Rules]]", (No. 8 in the UK Chart) (1974), "[[Down Down]]" (No. 1 in the UK chart) (1975), "[[Roll Over Lay Down]]" (No. 10 in the UK chart) (1975), "[[Rain (Status Quo song)|Rain]]" (No. 7 in the UK chart) (1976), "[[Mystery Song]]" (No. 11 in the UK Chart) (1976), "[[Wild Side of Life]]" (No. 9 in the UK chart) (1976), "[[Rockin' All Over the World]]" (No. 3 in the UK chart) (1977) and "[[Whatever You Want (Status Quo song)|Whatever You Want]]" (No. 4 in the UK Chart) (1979).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/status-quo-mn0000745241/biography|title=Status Quo &#124; Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=21 July 2021}}</ref> "Down Down" topped the [[UK Singles Chart]] in January 1975, becoming their only [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[List of number-one singles from the 1970s (UK)|No. 1]] single to date.<ref name="500 Number One Hits">{{cite book |first=Jo |last=Rice |year=1982 |title=The Guinness Book of 500 Number One Hits |edition=1st |publisher=Guinness Superlatives Ltd |location=Enfield, Middlesex |page=164 |isbn=0-85112-250-7}}</ref> In 1976, they signed a pioneering sponsorship deal with [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's]].<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> Quo have now{{when|date= February 2020}} sold approximately 118 million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statusquo.co.uk/factsheet.htm |title=Quo Facts |publisher=Statusquo.co.uk |access-date=15 July 2011}}</ref>

From 1977 onwards, the band's sound became more polished as they began to employ outside producers. These included [[Pip Williams]], [[Roger Glover]], and John Eden. Glover was the first outside producer to work with Quo since [[Pye Records|Pye]]'s [[John Schroeder (musician)|John Schroeder]] in the early 1970s, and produced "Wild Side of Life" and its [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] "All Through The Night" in 1976.

1977's ''[[Rockin' All Over the World (album)|Rockin' All Over the World]]''{{'}}s [[Rockin' All Over the World (song)|title track]], a minor hit for its writer [[John Fogerty]] (formerly of [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]]), became one of Status Quo's most enduring anthems.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> Sales remained high in the UK throughout the 1980s.

===1981–1991: Lineup changes, Live Aid and ''In The Army Now''===
Tensions within the band saw Coghlan leaving late in 1981.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> His replacement early the following year was [[Pete Kircher]] from the 1960s pop band [[Honeybus]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Andy Bown joined the band in an official capacity at this time. Although contracted to record more albums, this line-up played its last full-length gig on 21 July 1984 at the [[Milton Keynes Bowl]]. "Everybody was [[Cocaine dependence|coked-up]] and hating each other", Rossi recalled, "and I'd started drinking [[tequila]] on that tour. I don't remember that show at all – the encores or anything; just falling flat on my back at one point."<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Dave |last=Ling |title=Again again again… |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] #36 |date=January 2002|page=69}}</ref> "Deciding to retire from the road – all that was about was getting Francis a solo career," declared Lancaster. "Nobody on the outside knew it, but he didn't want to work with me or Rick anymore."<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Dave |last=Ling |title=Again again again… |magazine=Classic Rock #36 |date=January 2002 |page=73}}</ref>

Status Quo's final appearance with the Kircher line-up opened the [[Live Aid]] charity event at Wembley Stadium in July 1985. That year, Rossi recorded and released two solo singles with long-time writing partner Bernie Frost. Parfitt recorded a solo album, ''Recorded Delivery'', with bass player [[John Edwards (musician)|John "Rhino" Edwards]] and drummer [[Jeff Rich]]. The album remains unreleased, although some tracks were reworked and released sporadically as Quo [[B-side]]s until 1987.

In mid-1985, Rossi, Parfitt and Bown, with Edwards and Rich, started work on a new Quo album. Lancaster – by this time more or less settled in Australia – took out a [[Injunction|legal injunction]] to stop the band using the Status Quo name on records, citing increasing musical differences, notably during sessions for 1983's ''[[Back to Back (Status Quo album)|Back to Back]]''. The specific dispute concerned two tracks that became hits for the group around that time. Lancaster had co-written "[[Ol' Rag Blues]]", but was angered when the producers chose to release a version with Rossi singing the lead vocal instead of one sung by himself. The injunction also prevented the release of a single, "Naughty Girl", for which a catalogue number was issued by Vertigo.

An out-of-court settlement was made in January 1986, enabling the new Status Quo line-up to continue recording ''[[In the Army Now (album)|In The Army Now]]'', for which "Naughty Girl" was reworked as "Dreamin'". Lancaster remained in Australia, and in 1986 joined an Australian [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]], [[The Party Boys]], featuring [[Angry Anderson]] of [[Rose Tattoo]], [[John Brewster (musician)|John Brewster]] of [[The Angels (Australian band)|The Angels]] and [[Kevin Borich]], but achieved little success outside Australia. Lancaster left Status Quo formally in 1987.

In 1986, Quo supported [[Queen (band)|Queen]] on the latter's [[Magic Tour (Queen)|Magic Tour]]. The commercially successful ''[[In the Army Now (album)|In the Army Now]]'' album was released later that year. Its title track became one of the band's biggest UK singles, reaching number 2.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> The following album, ''[[Ain't Complaining]]'', in 1988, was less successful but produced the number 5 hit "[[Burning Bridges (Status Quo song)|Burning Bridges]]". Rerecorded (with new lyrics) in April 1994 with [[Manchester United F.C.]] as "[[Come On You Reds]]", the single would have given the band their second UK Number 1, but it was credited as 'by Manchester United'.

===1991–2010: ''Rock 'Til You Drop'', "Fun, Fun, Fun" and touring===
The early-to-mid-1990s saw falling album sales for the band. To promote the release of the ''Rock 'Til You Drop'' album (1991), Quo performed four arena gigs in Sheffield, Glasgow, Birmingham and London in the space of 12 hours, earning them a place in the Guinness Book of Records. The 1994 Quo album ''Thirsty Work'' included a cover of the [[Jennifer Warnes]] song "[[I'm Restless]]" revealing an alternative and lighter sound to the band.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> ''[[Don't Stop (Status Quo album)|Don't Stop]]'' (1996), and ''[[Famous in the Last Century]]'' (2000) consisted almost entirely of [[cover version]]s, (with the only exception being the title track to the latter).  The former brought some chart success for Quo with covers of [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s [[Don't Stop (Fleetwood Mac song)|"Don't Stop"]] and [[The Beach Boys]]' "[[Fun, Fun, Fun]]". The band became involved in an acrimonious dispute with [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] after the station refused to include the "Fun Fun Fun" single on the radio station's [[playlist]].<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/>

In 1993, Francis Rossi and Rick Parfitt attracted a crowd of over 25,000 when they performed the annual [[Blackpool Illuminations]] lights switch-on.

Parfitt underwent quadruple by-pass surgery in 1997, but was able to make a full recovery and returned with a performance at the Norwich City Football Club ground three months later. Status Quo also returned to Australia in 1997, completing their first tour there since 1978. A greatest hits compilation, ''Whatever You Want – The Very Best of Status Quo'' was also released, achieving silver sales in the UK that year. In 1999, Quo toured Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Dubbed the 'Last Night of the Proms', the band were backed by a full orchestra during the concerts.

Rich left in 2000 and was replaced by [[Matt Letley]]. Andrew Bown also took a year off at the same time following the death of his wife, and was temporarily replaced on stage by Paul Hirsh, formerly of [[Voyager (English band)|Voyager]].

In November 2000, the band played a gig at Grandchester in the [[outback]] in Australia, performing on a carriage of Australia's Orient Express, the [[Great South Pacific Express]].

In 2005 Rossi and Parfitt made cameo appearances in the long-running [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Coronation Street]]'' in a storyline which involved them being sued by the notorious layabout [[Les Battersby]], and performing live at his wedding as compensation.

In December 2005, it was announced that Parfitt had been taken ill and was undergoing tests for [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]]. All subsequent dates of the UK tour were cancelled as a result. However, the growths in Parfitt's throat were later found to be [[benign]] and were successfully removed. In May 2006, a fully recovered Parfitt and the band returned to the NEC Birmingham to play the show that they had postponed in December. This was their 40th show at the venue, and was recorded for a DVD, entitled "Just Doin' It".

On 1 July 2007, they performed in front of 63,000 people at the newly built [[Wembley Stadium]] as part of the ''[[Concert for Diana]]''. They also appeared on the TV programme [[Tiswas]] Reunited, in which the band got the usual greeting of custard pies and buckets of water whilst playing the song, "Gerdundula".

On 15 September 2007, Rossi and Parfitt appeared on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] programme [[Who Wants To Be A Millionaire]] and won £50,000 for their 2 charities Ebbisham Association and Nordoff Robbins.  

Their twenty-eighth studio album, ''[[In Search of the Fourth Chord]]'', was released on the band's own Fourth Chord label in September 2007 in the UK, and on Edel Records in the rest of Europe. Produced by veteran producer [[Pip Williams]], who had worked with Quo in the studio since 1977, the album was only moderately successful.

In 2008, they teamed up with [[Germany|German]] [[techno]] group [[Scooter (band)|Scooter]] to record a [[jumpstyle]] version of their 1979 single "[[Whatever You Want (Status Quo song)|Whatever You Want]]" entitled "[[Jump That Rock (Whatever You Want)]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scootertechno.com/ |title=Home |publisher=Scootertechno.Com |date=22 October 2013 |access-date=26 October 2013}}</ref> In December 2008, they released their 75th single and first Christmas single, entitled "[[It's Christmas Time (Status Quo song)|It's Christmas Time]]", which peaked at No. 40 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statusquo.co.uk/ |title=The Official Site |publisher=Status Quo |access-date=26 October 2013}}</ref>

===2010–2013: ''Hello Quo'', "Frantic Four" reunion tours and ''Bula Quo!''===
Rossi and Parfitt were each awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in the [[2010 New Year Honours]] for services to music. Their long-standing work for [[charitable organization|charities]] includes [[The Prince's Trust]], [[British Heart Foundation]] and Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy.

''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' magazine had reported on 17 March 2010 that the band had patched up their relationship with Alan Lancaster, and were discussing the possibility of a future collaboration.<ref name = crm>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/quo-kiss-and-make-up-with-former-bassist |title=Quo Kiss And Make Up With Former Bassist &#124; News, Top Posts &#124; Classic Rock |publisher=Classicrockmagazine.com |date=17 March 2010 |access-date=26 October 2013}}</ref> The article stated "While the band are back on friendly terms with Alan, it's unlikely we'll see any future reunion, with Quo continuing as normal and Lancaster busy with charity events and overseeing the activities of his son's band The Presence".<ref name = crm/>

On 20 September 2010, Status Quo was honoured with a [[PRS for Music]] plaque commemorating their first gig at the Welcome Inn in Well Hall Road, [[Eltham]], where the band first performed in 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://openplaques.org/plaques/4848 |title=Status Quo black plaque in London |publisher=Openplaques.org |date=20 September 2010 |access-date=21 May 2013}}</ref>

On 26 September 2010, a new version of "In the Army Now" was released through Universal / UMC. All profits from this updated and lyrically reworked version will be donated equally to the [[British Forces Foundation]] and [[Help for Heroes]] charities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.army.mod.uk/news-and-events/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723132032/http://www.army.mod.uk/news/21024.aspx|url-status=dead|title=News & Events|archive-date=23 July 2010|website=Army.mod.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertaimnet.wordpress.com/2013/10/25/its-still-the-status-quo-francis-rossi-is-in-the-army-now-interview-with-the-gomorr/ |title=Entertaim.net: interview with the GOMORR |publisher=Entertaim.net |date=25 October 2013 |access-date=26 October 2013}}</ref>

A [[box set]] of sessions, live concerts and TV appearances at the BBC was released on 25 October 2010, titled ''Live at the BBC''. The full 7CD version (+DVD) covers almost all appearances, while the 2CD and 4CD version present some highlights.

Their twenty-ninth studio album, ''[[Quid Pro Quo (album)|Quid Pro Quo]]'', was released in a deluxe format exclusively at [[Tesco]] on 30 May 2011.  The regular edition was released elsewhere on 7 June. The album peaked at number 10 in the UK chart.

December 2011 saw Status Quo undertake their first all-arenas UK winter tour. Quo also performed for the first time at [[The O2]] in London. The tour was dubbed ''Quofest'' and featured [[Roy Wood]] and [[Kim Wilde]] as support for all shows. They joined the band during the encore.

In August 2011, Status Quo began filming their first cinematic documentary with film director [[Alan G. Parker]]. Entitled ''Hello Quo!'', the production opened in cinemas on 22 October 2012. A Blu-ray/DVD release followed, through Anchor Bay Productions, on 29 October. The movie included contributions from [[Brian May]], [[Jeff Lynne]], [[Cliff Richard]], [[Joe Elliott]], [[Paul Weller]], [[Joe Brown (singer)|Joe Brown]], [[Jim Lea (musician)|Jim Lea]], [[Andy Scott (guitarist)|Andy Scott]] and [[Steve Diggle]].
