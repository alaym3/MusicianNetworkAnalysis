'''Jade Elizabeth Bird''' (born 1 October 1997) is an English singer, songwriter and musician. Bird's music has been influenced by many [[Folk music|folk]] and [[Americana (music)|Americana]] artists. The media, when describing Bird's music, have drawn comparisons with [[pop music|pop]], Americana, [[country music|country]] and [[folk rock]]. 

Bird's childhood was spent in [[Hexham]], London, Germany and [[Bridgend]], [[South Wales]]. It was in Bridgend, living with her mother following the separation of her parents, that Bird began to write songs. In her final year at [[BRIT School]], she recorded a [[Demo (music)|demo]] that led to a management deal. This, in turn, was followed by her signing to [[Glassnote Records]]. In 2017, she released her first [[extended play]] (EP) titled ''Something American''. This received a positive reception and she was listed in the [[BBC]] [[Sound of...|Sound of 2018]] list at the end of that year.

In 2018, she released the song "Lottery", which topped the [[Adult Alternative Airplay|Adult Alternative Songs]], making her the fifth female solo artist to top that chart since 2010. The release of her [[Jade Bird (album)|eponymous debut studio album]], in 2019, was met with a largely positive reception from critics. Her accolades include nominations at the [[Americana Music Honors & Awards]] and [[NME Awards]] and winning the award for International Breakthrough artist at the [[AIM Independent Music Awards]] in 2019. In 2020, amidst the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], Bird was the first artist to collaborate with [[Microsoft]] in what was named the RE:Surface project, a virtual live-streamed concert. In August 2021, she released her second album ''[[Different Kinds of Light]]''.

==Artistry==
===Influences===
[[File:Morissette.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Woman smiling in front of a multi-coloured background|Jade Bird has frequently cited [[Alanis Morissette]] (pictured) as an influence]]

Bird was introduced to folk music by a family friend; this included [[Neil Young]], [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]], [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Joni Mitchell]]. She took up guitar herself at this point, a time that also coincided with the separation of her parents. Bird commented, "I needed a vent, so I think that’s ultimately why I got into music so heavily, because of these transitions, so to speak".<ref>{{cite web|title=Meet Jade Bird, the Razor-Sharp British Folk Singer-Songwriter Taking Her Cues From Americana|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/jade-bird-love-has-all-been-done-before-new-song-interview|work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|date=6 November 2018|access-date=30 October 2020|last=Hahn|first=Rachel|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114234447/https://www.vogue.com/article/jade-bird-love-has-all-been-done-before-new-song-interview|archive-date=14 November 2020}}</ref> Also while learning to play guitar as a teenager, she was drawn towards [[Dolly Parton]] and [[The Civil Wars]].<ref name="Quinn1">{{cite web|title=Jade Bird|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jade-bird-jade-bird/|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=25 April 2019|access-date=30 October 2020|last=Moreland|first=Quinn|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201130214141/https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jade-bird-jade-bird/|archive-date=30 November 2020}}</ref> The Civil Wars was the first Americana artist that Bird listened to.<ref name="CSmith1">{{cite web|title=Jade Bird Is Serious About Being A Feminist Role Model|url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/05/200126/jade-bird-feminist-role-model-lottery-cathedral|publisher=[[Refinery29]]|date=27 May 2018|access-date=30 October 2020|last=Smith|first=Courtney E.}}</ref> ''[[Music Week]]'' stated that she regarded [[Patti Smith]] and [[Alanis Morissette]] highly and, in an interview with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', she opined that Morissette's ''[[Jagged Little Pill]]'' is her favourite album ever.<ref>{{cite web|title=On The Radar: Jade Bird|url=https://www.musicweek.com/radar/read/on-the-radar-jade-bird/071942|work=[[Music Week]]|date=28 March 2018|access-date=30 October 2020|last=Homewood|first=Ben|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201130214529/https://www.musicweek.com/radar/read/on-the-radar-jade-bird/071942|archive-date=30 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Get to Know 'Lottery' Singer-Songwriter Jade Bird: Watch|url=https://www.billboard.com/index.php/articles/news/8456811/jade-bird-get-to-know-lottery-singer-songwriter-video|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=21 May 2018|access-date=7 November 2020|last=Schiller|first=Rebecca|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201130214744/https://www.billboard.com/index.php/articles/news/8456811/jade-bird-get-to-know-lottery-singer-songwriter-video|archive-date=30 November 2020}}</ref>
