'''OnlyOneOf''' (온리원오브) is a South Korean boy group formed by RSVP and [[8D Creative]] in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://people.search.naver.com/search.naver?where=nexearch&sm=tab_ppn&query=%EC%98%A8%EB%A6%AC%EC%9B%90%EC%98%A4%EB%B8%8C&os=9813498&ie=utf8&key=PeopleService|title=온리원오브 프로필|publisher=Naver|language=ko}}</ref> The group debuted on May 28, 2019, with ''Dot Point Jump''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nocutnews.co.kr/news/5154401|title=보이그룹 온리원오브 데뷔일은 28일|publisher=No Cut News|language=ko}}</ref>

== History ==
=== 2016–2018: Pre-debut references and activities ===
In December 2016, [[Blockberry Creative]] announced the debut of a new group called "8x8x8", which would follow up from the ongoing debut project of girl group [[Loona]]. This name originated from the fact that they would debut on August 8, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wowtv.co.kr/NewsCenter/News/Read?articleId=A201612160066|title=이달의 소녀 만든 블록베리크리에이티브, 새 그룹 8X8X8 예고|publisher=wowtv|language=ko}}</ref> Along with this, Blockberry Creative also announced they would begin holding auditions from January 2017 to determine the lineup of this group.

The next year, in April 2017, the first of these trainees was revealed, with the appearance of leader Love in the music video for ViVi of Loona's solo album. Later, in September 2017, 8x8x8 was once again mentioned briefly in the description of [[Loona Odd Eye Circle]]'s music video for 'Girl Front', stating that the B-Side "Chaotic" on their mini-album "Mix & Match" had 'initially been chosen to be the title track for 8x8x8.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyInv6RWL0Q|title=Girl Front|date=September 20, 2017|last=이달의소녀|first=오드아이써클|publisher=YouTube|language=ko}}</ref>

However, as no further mention was made of the group after this point, with LOONA releasing their lead single for their debut album on August 7, 2018, it led many to believe that 8x8x8 had either been delayed or shelved, in order for BlockBerryCreative to prioritize their main group.

===2019: Debut with ''Dot Point Jump'' and First Comeback ''Line Sun Goodness''===
On April 30, however, Jaden Jeong (OnlyOneOf's creative director) posted the logo of OnlyOneOf to his Instagram,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bw4pJSSpVQh/|title=Logo OnlyOneOf|date=September 20, 2017|last=Jeong|first=Jaden|publisher=Instagram|language=ko}}</ref> announcing that the group would 'finally debut in May'. It has therefore been speculated that, after the departure of Jaden Jeong from Blockberry Creative, the trainees who had been selected for the lineup of "8x8x8" were transferred to [[8D Creative]]'s RSVP label.

With the release of the first group image a day later, as well as the music video teaser for "Savanna", familiar faces were soon spotted among the members. One of these was Love, who, as previously mentioned, had appeared in LOONA member ViVi's debut music video "Everyday I Love You", as well as starring as one of the male leads in the webdrama "Woomanna".

It was revealed on May 24, that the group would debut with two title tracks: fan title "Savanna" and pop title "time leap", as part of a mini album titled ''Dot Point Jump''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wowtv.co.kr/NewsCenter/News/Read?articleId=A201905240325|title='고품격 루키' 온리원오브, 대중 참여형 발매 방식 눈길|date=May 24, 2019|publisher=한국경제|language=ko}}</ref> Four days later, on May 28, 2019, the music videos for both title tracks "Savanna" and "time leap" were released, with each of the other tracks being unveiled individually once the hashtag '#OnlyOneOf' had been used 5,555 times on Twitter. These milestones were reached over the following days, with the full mini album being available for purchase as of June 13.

On October 4, the first teaser for their second mini album ''Line Sun Goodness'' was uploaded to YouTube, announcing that their first comeback would take place in the same month. A week later, the individual teaser photo for YooJung was released, revealing the album would be released on October 30.  OnlyOneOf made their first comeback with the title track "Sage". Due to technical difficulties,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/OnlyOneOf_twt/status/1189458473982971905|title=OnlyOneOf_twt|publisher=Twitter|language=ko}}</ref> the music video was not released until 3 days later, on November 2.

===2020: "Unknown art pop 2.1", "Yours only 2.2", and ''Produced by [ ]'' series===
On January 23, the first teaser for "unknown art pop 2.1" was released, and "dOra maar" was released a week later. To celebrate this, OnlyOneOf held a contest for participants to write English lyrics for "dOra maar", with the winner receiving a cash prize of $100,000, as well as having their version released as the official international version at a later date.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/onlyoneof_twt/status/1222716146320719872|title=OnlyOneOf_twt|publisher=Twitter|language=ko}}</ref>

On April 30, it was announced that there would by three separate releases for OnlyOneOf in the works ''Produced by [ ] series''. The first release, ''Produced by [ ] Part 1'', was produced by GRAY, BOYCOLD, Cha Cha Malone.  The first teaser was released five days later on May 4.  On May 21, the single album with the title track "Angel" was released.

On June 15, the first teaser for the second release, ''Produced by [ ] Part 2'', was released. On August 7, the first individual teaser of Yoojung was released. Following Yoojung, every member's individuals teasers were released in the following days. The second release was produced by [[GroovyRoom]], [[Samuel Seo]], and Jr Groove. The second single album was released on August 27 with the title track "a sOng Of ice & fire".

=== 2021–present: ''Instinct Part.1,'' ''Produced by [Myself]'', Love's departure and Japanese debut ===
On April 8, OnlyOneOf released their third mini album ''Instinct Part. 1'' with the title track "Libido".

On July 15, OnlyOneOf released their third single album ''Produced by [Myself]''.

On August 2, Love withdrew from the group due to personal reasons.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Park Soo-in|date=August 2, 2021|title=온리원오브 측 “개인적인 일로 러브 탈퇴 진행중, 일정 재조정”(공식입장 전문)|language=ko|trans-title=OnlyOneOf's side "Withdrawal from Love due to personal reasons, rescheduled" (full of official position)|work=Newsen|publisher=Naver|url=https://entertain.naver.com/now/read?oid=609&aid=0000474773|access-date=August 2, 2021}}</ref>
