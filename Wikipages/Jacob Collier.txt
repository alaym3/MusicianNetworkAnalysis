== Career ==

=== Early videos ===
Collier began uploading homemade, multi-instrumental content to YouTube in 2011, releasing vocal arrangements of "[[Pure Imagination]]" from the 1971 film ''[[Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory]]'', and in 2013, a multi-instrumental rendition of Stevie Wonder's "Don't You Worry 'bout a Thing". Collier's uploads utilized split screen, multitrack recordings of Collier singing each of the arrangement's harmonies. These videos gained solid traction, with some videos -such as the aforementioned "Don't You Worry 'bout a Thing" cover- garnering millions of views. His activity caught the attention of [[Quincy Jones]],<ref name="auto1" /> who flew Collier out to the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] where they met and then met with [[Herbie Hancock]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/interviews/meet-jacob-collier-jazz-sensation-gone-youtube-royal-albert/|title=Meet Jacob Collier: the jazz sensation that's gone from YouTube to the Royal Albert Hall|last=Hewett|first=Ivan|date=17 July 2018|work=The Telegraph|access-date=4 July 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>

Around this time, Ben Bloomberg, a PhD student at the MIT Media Lab, contacted Collier regarding the creation and development of musical hardware and software for live performance. Over the following months, he and Collier constructed a multimedia live experience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.audioxpress.com/article/Jacob-Collier-and-Ben-Bloomberg-Turn-to-DPA-Microphones-to-Record-Live-Stage-Shows|title=Jacob Collier and Ben Bloomberg turn to DPA Microphones.|access-date=27 June 2016}}</ref>

== Musical style and influences ==
Coming from a family of musicians, Collier was introduced to music at a very early age. With the support of his mother, he learned to play various instruments and began teaching himself musical theory. His recording career began in his family home, in a room filled with instruments that his mother used to teach violin lessons. There, he recorded himself singing and playing instruments – usually covers of folk or pop songs – using a split screen recording technique to visualize his vocals, which he uploaded to [[YouTube]]. These recordings often featured extreme uses of [[reharmonization]], [[Close and open harmony|close harmony]], [[Dissonance (music)|dissonance]], [[Microtonal music|microtonality]] and [[polyrhythm]]s, all relatively complex and uncommon concepts in popular music. Some of these incursions were aided by Collier's rare ability to recognize musical notes by ear, called [[absolute pitch]].<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Why All Your Favorite Artists Love Album of the Year Nominee Jacob Collier|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/awards/9536143/jacob-collier-grammy-album-of-the-year-interview/|access-date=2021-08-03|magazine=Billboard|language=en}}</ref>
