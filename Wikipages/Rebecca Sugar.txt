She stated that some of the changes in animation for years to come were inspired by what the show was able to do by being "very artist-driven," by independent comic artists like herself.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Moen |first1=Matt |title=In Conversation: Rebecca Sugar and Noelle Stevenson |url=https://www.papermag.com/rebecca-sugar-noelle-stevenson-2646446747.html |website=[[Paper Magazine]] |access-date=August 10, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200809164913/https://www.papermag.com/rebecca-sugar-noelle-stevenson-2646446747.html |archive-date=August 9, 2020 |date=August 5, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Production for ''Steven Universe'' began while Sugar was still working on ''Adventure Time''.
