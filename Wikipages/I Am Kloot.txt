'''I Am Kloot''' were an English [[Rock music|rock]] band, formed in [[Manchester]] in 1999. The band was composed of vocalist/guitarist [[John Bramwell]], bassist Peter Jobson and drummer Andy Hargreaves.

The band released six studio albums, and was nominated for the [[Mercury Prize]] in 2010 for the album ''[[Sky at Night (album)|Sky at Night]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local-news/i-am-kloot-have-eyes-on-the-mercury-prize-896312 |title=I Am Kloot have eyes on the Mercury Prize |publisher=Manchester Evening News |date=2010-08-12 |access-date=2014-08-19}}</ref> The band split up in 2016, with Bramwell concentrating on a solo career.

The origin of the band name was shrouded in secrecy for the majority of the band's existence, with Bramwell stating in 2013 that the band "never said and we never will" confirm the origin of the name and joked that "If I told you, I'd have to kill you". Jobson later claimed that the name I Am Kloot was inspired by the [[Alan J. Pakula]] film [[Klute]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.piccadillyrecords.com/prod/IAmKloot-FromHereToThere(OfficialSoundtrack)-Kudos-100141.html|title=I Am Kloot - From Here To There (Official Soundtrack) / Kudos from Piccadilly Records|date=8 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208062801/http://www.piccadillyrecords.com/prod/IAmKloot-FromHereToThere(OfficialSoundtrack)-Kudos-100141.html|access-date=20 October 2020|archive-date=8 December 2014}}</ref> and also that "I Am Kloot is a left handed card game made famous in the diaries of [[Jerome K.

The band released their second double A-Side single "Twist/86 TV's" in March 2000 on Ugly Man before signing to [[Wall of Sound (record label)|Wall of Sound]] imprint "We Love You" to release their debut album ''[[Natural History (I Am Kloot album)|Natural History]]'' in March 2001. Having decided against recording the album in the band's rehearsal space in Jobson's basement, it was recorded with [[Elbow (band)|Elbow]] frontman [[Guy Garvey]] in a church on the [[Isle of Mull]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRs5ECeChtcC&q=%22I+am+kloot%22+%22natural+history%22+%22Isle+of+mull%22&pg=PT53 |title=Reluctant Heroes: The Story of Elbow - Mick Middles - Google Books |date= 5 November 2009|access-date=2014-08-19|isbn=9780857120250 |last1=Middles |first1=Mick }}</ref> Despite being heralded by the [[NME]] as figureheads of the so-called New Acoustic Movement (although Bramwell didn't want to admit to there being an acoustic scene at the time "because of the labels that immediately get attached to ‘acoustic music’"),<ref name="collo.tripod.com"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-17731101.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714221901/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-17731101.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-07-14 |title=Trio's highly strung |publisher=Highbeam.com |access-date=2014-08-19}}</ref> the band returned home from touring to find the label had gone bust, owing the band money.<ref name="globaltexanchronicles.blogspot.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://globaltexanchronicles.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/i-am-kloot-best-is-to-come.html?m=1 |title=Global Texan Chronicles: I Am Kloot: The Best Is To Come |publisher=Globaltexanchronicles.blogspot.co.uk |date= 5 July 2014|access-date=2014-08-19}}</ref> The album went out of print in the UK, which Bramwell later described as a stalling moment for the band,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.7digital.com/features/interviews/i-am-kloot|title=I Am Kloot &#124; Interview &#124; High quality music downloads &#124; 7digital United Kingdom|publisher=7digital.com|access-date=2014-08-19|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724082843/http://www.7digital.com/features/interviews/i-am-kloot|archive-date=24 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> but was still available in Europe due to it being distributed by a different label, so the band toured Holland, Germany and France instead of focusing on the UK.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ben P Scott |url=http://www.godisinthetvzine.co.uk/2013/01/24/interview-i-am-kloots-john-bramwell/ |title=INTERVIEW: I Am Kloot's John Bramwell &#124; God Is In The TV |publisher=Godisinthetvzine.co.uk |date=2013-01-24 |access-date=2014-08-19}}</ref>

Following two years of contractual problems, the band signed to [[The Echo Label]] and released their self-titled second album ''[[I Am Kloot (album)|I Am Kloot]]'' in September 2003 with Bramwell stating that the band didn't "fit into the current Strokes/White Stripes rock thing, so we're out on a limb again."<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EBEEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22i+am+kloot%22+%22signed+to+echo%22&pg=PA65 |title=Billboard - Google Books |date=2003-10-04 |access-date=2014-08-19}}</ref> The album was produced by [[Chris Potter (record producer)|Chris Potter]], with [[Ian Broudie]] producing one song, "[[Life in a Day (song)|Life in a Day]]".<ref>{{cite web|title=I Am Kloot – I Am Kloot|url=http://www.discogs.com/I-Am-Kloot-I-Am-Kloot/release/643155|work=Discogs|publisher=Discogs|access-date=31 March 2013|year=2013}}</ref> Despite originally planning to release "Proof" as a single to promote the album, going as far as approving artwork and track listing, as well as commissioning a promo video starring [[Christopher Eccleston]], it ended up not receiving a commercial release in the UK. Instead, the promo video was made available through the band's website and only received a physical release in the [[Benelux]] countries on the PIAS record label. At the time, Bramwell claimed that the single wasn't released properly as they "didn’t want to do any singles any more",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pennyblackmusic.co.uk/MagSitePages/Article.aspx?id=3392 |title=I am Kloot : Interview with Jonny Bramwell Part 2 |publisher=Pennyblackmusic.co.uk |access-date=2014-08-19}}</ref> but later admitted that the record label refused to release it.<ref name="vanguard-online.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguard-online.co.uk/0910IIAK.htm |title=I Am Kloot Interview Sept 09 |publisher=Vanguard-online.co.uk |access-date=2014-08-19}}</ref>

The band released their third album ''[[Gods and Monsters (I Am Kloot album)|Gods and Monsters]]'' in April 2005 via The Echo Label. The album was recorded at Moolah Rouge Studios in [[Stockport]] with Joe Robinson, who had previously worked with [[Badly Drawn Boy]] and [[Alfie (band)|Alfie]]. During sessions for the album, they placed microphones everywhere, commenting that they "were miking up things that were vibrating because we were playing. If you’ve got a tabletop with cups and saucers on it, it might vibrate when you play a certain note, and not when you play others. So you mike up the tabletop, and play the song, and on certain notes you get these strange sounds" and added that they "kept it sparse, not layering it up so much as adding colour".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.threemonkeysonline.com/the-drama-of-it-all-i-am-kloot-in-interview/ |title=I am Kloot in Interview (Gods and Monsters) |publisher=Threemonkeysonline.com |date=2005-05-01 |access-date=2014-08-19}}</ref> Bramwell proclaimed that "something clicked in the last 12 months, I felt as if the band had just begun, as if we'd sprung from the head of Zeus in Full body armour",<ref name="hist" /> yet later claimed that he "got the shakes around Gods and Monsters. I was over-thinking, not going with my instincts writing-wise".<ref name="independent.co.uk"/>

In August 2005, the band parted ways with The Echo Label after it "became clear the label were unable to sustain the band's financial backing".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/8135/list.gigwise.com |title=I Am Kloot Part Company With Record Label |publisher=Gigwise |date=2005-08-25 |access-date=2014-08-19}}</ref> It transpired that the label's parent company, the [[Chrysalis Group]] had announced a restructuring of The Echo Label after announcing a loss of over £2.0 million,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chrysalis.com/investor_reports_db/Chrysalis%20Group%20Full%20Annual%20Report.pdf|title=Chrysalis Group PLC Annual Report 2006|website=Chrysalis.com}}</ref> resulting in a change of direction at the label and dropping many of its roster including [[Black Rebel Motorcycle Club]] and [[The Stands]], with I Am Kloot jumping before they were pushed.

On 21 November 2005, the band released the Guy Garvey/[[Craig Potter (musician)|Craig Potter]] produced stand-alone single "[[Maybe I Should]]" via their own label, [[Skinny Dog Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iamkloot.com/www/news.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20051202034947/http://www.iamkloot.com/www/news.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 December 2005 |title=News |publisher=I Am Kloot (imakloot.com) |date=2005-12-01 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The single followed a short UK tour, which saw the band play their biggest headlining shows to date, culminating with a show at the [[London Astoria]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.music-news.com/shownews.asp?H=Elbow-and-I-Am-Kloot-team-up&nItemID=7930 |title=Elbow and I Am Kloot team up |publisher=Music-News.com |access-date=2014-08-19}}</ref>

In October 2006, the band released [[BBC Radio 1 John Peel Sessions (I Am Kloot album)|BBC Radio 1 John Peel Sessions]], a compilation of session tracks that were recorded for [[John Peel]]'s BBC Radio One programme over two sessions in 2001 and 2004.<ref>{{cite web|title=I Am Kloot – BBC Radio 1 John Peel Sessions|url=http://www.discogs.com/I-Am-Kloot-BBC-Radio-1-John-Peel-Sessions/release/852293|work=Discogs|publisher=Discogs|access-date=31 March 2013|year=2013}}</ref>

Without a record deal, the band began work on their fourth album at Moolah Rouge Studios in early 2006, with Jobson describing the recording set up in May of that year as being "quite relaxed. When it feels right we record and hopefully that mood will pervade the album" and revealed that they were working with the studios owners Colin & Norman McLeod who also played live with the band, and added that "the atmosphere in the studio with them is inspiring".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iamkloot.blogspot.co.uk/2006/05/interview.html |title=I Am Kloot Fansite: INTERVIEW |publisher=Iamkloot.blogspot.co.uk |date=2006-05-25 |access-date=2014-08-19}}</ref> The band premiered several new songs at Manchester Academy in November 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/i-am-kloot/2006/manchester-academy-3-manchester-england-23d7e4e3.html |title=I Am Kloot Concert Setlist at Manchester Academy 3, Manchester on November 3, 2006 |publisher=setlist.fm |access-date=2014-08-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rjIy4zp4HY |title=IAK new songs better synch |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-01-04 |access-date=2014-08-19}}</ref> However, these recordings were ditched in 2007, with the band choosing to record the songs over three days<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culturecatch.com/music/i-am-kloot-play-moolah-rouge |title=Heavy Texture and Tone &#124; Dusty Wright's Culture Catch |publisher=Culturecatch.com |date=2008-05-16 |access-date=2014-08-19}}</ref> live in the studio with no overdubs, treating the recording as a gig.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/leisure/music/2190889.print/ |title=I Am Kloot, Komedia, Brighton, April 15 (From The Argus) |publisher=Theargus.co.uk |date=2008-04-11 |access-date=2014-08-19}}</ref> To reflect the live nature of the recordings, the album was released as ''[[I Am Kloot Play Moolah Rouge]]'', initially as a limited edition hand numbered 2000 copy CD in November 2007 at three shows at Manchester Academy (the same venue where they previewed some of the songs a year previous),<ref>{{cite web|title=I Am Kloot – Play Moolah Rouge|url=http://www.discogs.com/I-Am-Kloot-Play-Moolah-Rouge/release/1996881|work=Discogs|publisher=Discogs|access-date=31 March 2013|year=2013}}</ref> before receiving a full commercial release through Skinny Dog Records on 14 April 2008 with an additional DVD featuring a documentary on the band from the now defunct [[Channel M]] station.<ref>{{cite web|title=I Am Kloot I Am Kloot Play Moolah Rouge|url=http://drownedinsound.com/releases/13247/reviews/3389234-|work=Drowned In Sound|publisher=Drownedinsound.com|access-date=31 March 2013|author=Daniel Ross|date=4 June 2008|archive-date=4 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104172116/http://drownedinsound.com/releases/13247/reviews/3389234-|url-status=dead}}</ref> The album was dedicated to former bandmate and friend Bryan Glancy who died in January 2006, with Bramwell revealing that "lots of the lyrics on the album come from conversations with Bryan".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.muffathalle.de/cms/download.php?id=4563 |title=Download |publisher=Muffathalle.de |access-date=2014-08-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714212611/http://www.muffathalle.de/cms/download.php?id=4563 |archive-date=14 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Bramwell also commented that the band "might have returned to something that we had initially, which we all think is maybe quite a good idea".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manchesterconfidential.co.uk/Entertainment-and-Sport/Music/I-Am-Kloot-free-gig-this-weekend |title=I Am Kloot free gig this weekend &#124; Music |publisher=Manchester Confidential |date=2008-08-21 |access-date=2014-08-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714175935/http://www.manchesterconfidential.co.uk/Entertainment-and-Sport/Music/I-Am-Kloot-free-gig-this-weekend |archive-date=14 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It was revealed in November 2008 that film director [[Danny Boyle]], who had used the band's song "Avenue Of Hope" on the closing credits to his film ''[[Sunshine (2007 film)|Sunshine]]'' the previous year, had approached the band to develop an original musical with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/09/11/danny-boyle-in-talks-to-directa-musical/ |title=Danny Boyle In Talks To Direct…A Musical? |publisher=Moviesblog.mtv.com |access-date=2014-08-19}}</ref>

We got played on the radio, which had never happened before, and then to be nominated for the Mercury was massive for a band like us – we’ve always been about word of mouth" and admitting that prior to the album being released, that "after 10 years of gigging and working hard, we basically had nothing at all - no manager, label, money, we were pretty fucked up to be honest".<ref name="mancunion.com"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pagesdigital.com/interview-i-am-kloot/ |title=Interview: I Am Kloot |publisher=Pagesdigital.com |date=2011-01-21 |access-date=2014-08-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140709162049/http://www.pagesdigital.com/interview-i-am-kloot/ |archive-date=9 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Bramwell described the album as "a bit of a sidestep; a one-off, single-themed, late-night, romantic LP".<ref name="rocksucker.co.uk"/>

The band released their sixth studio album, ''[[Let It All In]]'' on 21 January 2013, and was preceded by a live stream of the album on the ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' website.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.iamkloot.com/letitallin/ | title = I Am Kloot - Let It All In | publisher = iamkloot.com | access-date = 2 October 2012 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://archive.today/20121222223558/http://www.iamkloot.com/letitallin/ | archive-date = 22 December 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=I Am Kloot – Let It All In: exclusive album stream|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/jan/14/i-am-kloot-let-it-all-in-stream|access-date=31 March 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 January 2013}}</ref> Less orchestrated than ''Sky at Night'', the album was recorded initially as a 3-piece, with the recordings finalised over 6 weeks with producers Garvey and Potter.<ref name="mancunion.com"/> On the song "Bullets" Bramwell can be heard singing with a lisp, initially claiming to have lost several teeth during a speedboat accident in the south of France, Bramwell later admitted that his teeth just started falling out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/features/79098/I-Am-Kloot-%27We%27ve-covered-drinking-and-disaster%27 |title=I Am Kloot: 'We've covered drinking and disaster' |publisher=Gigwise |date=2013-01-25 |access-date=2014-08-19}}</ref> The album featured the eventual release of the song "Even The Stars", which was regularly played live prior to the release of ''I Am Kloot Play Moolah Rouge'', but was omitted from that album. It was then set to feature on ''Sky At Night'', with Bramwell stating that the song was "almost like a single. The thing with singles is they tend to not have all the Kloot elements in them because they’ve got too poppy. But this song has got a real hook, it’s still got a lot of the soul and ghostliness that all Kloot songs should have",<ref name="vanguard-online.co.uk"/> but was then omitted from that album too. The version eventually released is much slower than previous versions, with Bramwell admitting that the band had "tried recording it in many different ways; I think we’ve finally found one that works in a Kloot way. There are some more exciting live versions of it that we’ve done, but when we tried recording it previously it didn’t work".<ref name="rocksucker.co.uk"/>

In July 2014, Jobson revealed that the band's "last 2 albums have been very elaborate and our business set up has been very corporate. Although that has brought benefits it has also distracted us from what Kloot is about. Some of the most commercially successful things we have done have been artistically and personally the most unrewarding" and added that this period had "taken its toll on our relationship. We were doing something we didn´t want to do. It took a while to find that out. We were pretty sick for a while there."<ref name="globaltexanchronicles.blogspot.co.uk"/>

The band released the [[live album]] ''[[Hold Back the Night (album)|Hold Back the Night]]'' on 13 April 2015 via [[Walk Tall Recordings]] / [[PIAS Recordings|PIAS]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://mediapias.fr/artistes/i-am-kloot-1 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150414104230/http://mediapias.fr/artistes/i-am-kloot-1 | title = I Am Kloot Hold Back The Night | publisher = PIAS France | archive-date = 14 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://louderthanwar.com/i-kloot-hold-back-night-album-review/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414103844/http://louderthanwar.com/i-kloot-hold-back-night-album-review/  | title = I am Kloot – Hold Back The Night – album review | first=Alan |last=Ewart | publisher = Louder Than War | date = 10 April 2015 | archive-date = 14 April 2015}}</ref>

The band performed in June 2016 as part of the 'Guy Garvey's Cultural Meltdown' at the Royal Festival Hall in London. Prior to that, the band had not played or met up together for over 12 months.

In November 2017, Bramwell revealed that the band had split up, stating that "There was no heavy break-up or anything. I just wanted to do something else. I'll never say never to getting back together but I was in I Am Kloot most of my adult life, but just as you can go to a great place on holiday year after year, sooner or later you want to go to somewhere else".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/leisure/music/15653693.Goodbye_I_Am_Kloot__hello_to_John_Bramwell_s_solo_career__VW_Campervan_travels_and_all/?ref=twt |title = Goodbye I Am Kloot, hello to John Bramwell's solo career, VW Campervan travels and all|website=Yorkpress.co.uk}}</ref> He later added that "the real reason I’ve gone solo is because I started as a finger-style classical and folk guitarist. It was great to be in a band, but at the end of the day it doesn’t really work in that format. It needs to be exposed".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://writewyattuk.com/2018/08/23/glade-alive-the-john-bramwell-interview/ |title = Glade Alive – the John Bramwell interview|website=Writewyattuk.com|date = 23 August 2018}}</ref>

Bassist Pete Jobson now resides full time in London with his actor wife and his young family.

Drummer Andy Hargreaves is currently playing live with singer-songwriter Matt Skinner.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/JoelTurnerPhotographer/photos/a.1660235787381450.1073741851.935482396523463/1660236010714761/?type=3 |title=Facebook |publisher=Facebook.com |access-date=2020-03-10}}</ref>

John Bramwell has spent time touring solo in the UK and Europe. He released his solo album 'Leave Alone The Empty Spaces' in November 2017.

==Awards==
''Sky at Night'' was shortlisted for the 2010 Barclaycard [[Mercury Music Prize]]. In response to the nomination, Bramwell stated: "I thought we'd be out of, off people's radar enough, that they wouldn't have, kind of, noticed. One of the factors why they actually did pay attention to this record is the fact that Guy [Garvey] and Craig [Potter] produced it."<ref name="Bbc">{{cite news|title=Elbow's Garvey and I Am Kloot's Bramwell talk Mercury Prize|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11184337|access-date=31 March 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=6 September 2010}}</ref>
