'''Tyler Colon''' (born November 9, 1995), known professionally as '''Tai Verdes''', is an American singer-songwriter. He grew up in California and played guitar, piano, and ukulele. Playing on the basketball team during his attendance at [[Babson College]], he maintained his love for music and eventually dropped out. He worked at a phone store during the [[COVID-19 pandemic|coronavirus outbreak]], but this still helped further his musical passion and during the same time, released his breakout single "Stuck in the Middle" in August 2020. The song went viral on [[TikTok]].<ref name="biography">{{Cite web|title=Tai Verdes Biography, Songs, & Albums|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/tai-verdes-mn0004005730/biography/|url-status=live|access-date=November 13, 2021|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> He responded to his newfound success by saying the song "doesn't just turn into a million dollars and a nice car.

==Career==
Tai released his first single "Stuck In the Middle" in mid-2020, which overtime racked millions of streams on multiple streaming services. During this time, he was sleeping on a friend's couch and working at a [[Verizon]] phone service store. Before this, he auditioned for shows like [[The Voice (American TV series)|''The Voice'']] and ''[[American Idol]]'', but to no avail. However, he did end up winning an MTV dating series. 

With $50,000 waiting to be spent, he moved to Los Angeles, working at any job he could. Whilst doing this, he worked on music.

The song became viral on [[TikTok]]. This success carried to other singles such as "Sheesh!" and "Drugs".<ref name="AOK" /><ref name="More success">{{Cite web|last=Kato|first=Brooke|date=July 13, 2021|title=From Verizon worker to star: Tai Verdes’ TikTok fairytale|url=https://www.nypost.com/2021/07/13/tai-verdes-rise-to-fame-from-verizon-worker-to-tiktok-star/amp/|url-status=live|access-date=November 13, 2021|website=[[New York Post]]}}</ref>
