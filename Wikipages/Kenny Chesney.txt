===Signing first publishing and record deals===
In 1992, the head of writer relations at [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]], Clay Bradley, recommended Chesney to his friend, [[Troy Tomlinson]], at Opryland Music Group by saying: "I met this kid today from East Tennessee. He's a good singer, a good songwriter, and more than anything, I think you're going to really like him as a person."<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Troy_Tomlinson_Interview.html |title=Interview With Troy Tomlinson |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=Dec 10, 2007 |access-date=May 10, 2011}}</ref> Chesney performed five songs during his audition for Tomlinson. Tomlinson's reaction was enthusiastic, later telling [[HitQuarters]]:

<blockquote>First of all I was attracted to the songs, because I thought that he painted great pictures in his lyrics, particularly for someone who had not been around the typical Music Row co-writes. I thought that he sang very well too. But more than anything there was a kind of this 'I-will-do-it' look in his eyes – I was really drawn in by the fact that he was so set on being successful in this business.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/></blockquote>

Chesney left the audition with a songwriter's contract. A year later, an appearance at a songwriter's showcase led to a contract with [[Capricorn Records]], which had recently started a country division.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===''In My Wildest Dreams'' (1994)===
Chesney's debut album, ''[[In My Wildest Dreams]]'', was released on the independent [[Capricorn Records]] label in April 1994.

The album sold approximately 10,000 copies before Capricorn Records closed its country music division in Nashville later that year and moved to Atlanta.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p64127|pure_url=yes}} |title=allmusic ((( Kenny Chesney – Biography ))) |access-date=2007-09-27 |last=Huey |first= Steve |work=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

===''Just Who I Am: Poets & Pirates'' (2007–2008)===
[[File:Kenny Chesney 20070830.jpg|thumb|Kenny Chesney performing in 2007]]
On September 11, 2007, Chesney released the album ''[[Just Who I Am: Poets & Pirates]]''. This album represented a move to a more [[gulf and western (music genre)|gulf and western]] sound with a number of "breezy, steel-drum island songs".<ref>Stephen Thomas Erlewine. [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1185082|pure_url=yes}} Review of ''Just Who I Am: Poets & Pirates''] at [[AllMusic]]</ref> [[Kanye West]] and [[50 Cent]]'s albums ''[[Graduation (album)|Graduation]]'' and ''[[Curtis (50 Cent album)|Curtis]]'' were both released that same day. Those artists were in the midst of a competitive sales war, with the latter claiming that he would end his solo rap career if West sold more albums than he did (remarks he later retracted as terms of his contract conflicted with the promise). Chesney, however, decided that he would give country music a place in the competition, claiming country artists were just as popular as those in the [[Rap music|rap]] genre. Chesney came in third place in record sales among the three musical artists.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The lead-off single from ''Just Who I Am: Poets & Pirates'' was "[[Never Wanted Nothing More]]". That song became Chesney's twelfth number one hit on the ''Billboard'' country charts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=791&t=Kenny_Chesney_sets_record_with_Never_Wanted_Nothing_More |title=Kenny Chesney sets record with "Never Wanted Nothing More" |access-date=2007-07-26 |work=CountryStandardTime.com}}</ref>  On the U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot Country Songs chart dated for the week ending on September 15, 2007, the album's second single "[[Don't Blink]]" debuted at No.&nbsp;16, setting a new record for the highest debut on that chart since the inception of [[MRC Data|SoundScan]] electronic tabulation in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kennychesney.com/news-full.html?pId=1804 |title="Don't Blink" Is Billboard's Highest Chart Debut Ever! |access-date=2007-08-29 |work=Kenny Chesney.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303211713/http://kennychesney.com/news-full.html?pId=1804 |archive-date=2016-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This record was broken one week later by [[Garth Brooks]]' "[[More Than a Memory]]", which debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on the same chart, making it the first song ever to do so. The third single, "[[Shiftwork (song)|Shiftwork]]" (a duet with [[George Strait]]) peaked at No.&nbsp;2 on the country charts. During the week of June 28, 2008, the fourth and final single, "[[Better as a Memory]]", became Chesney's fourteenth number one hit.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}
[[Image:kenny chesney tour bus 2008 (2695199093).jpg|thumb|Kenny Chesney's Poets and Pirates tour bus in 2008]]
Chesney started his ''Poets and Pirates Tour'' on April 26, 2008 at [[Williams-Brice Stadium]] in [[Columbia, South Carolina]]. During the introduction of his set, his boot got caught between a hydraulic lift and the lip of the stage surface, which crushed his foot causing a severe [[hematoma]] in the ankle; most of the damage was centering within his toes. It took about 30&nbsp;seconds for Chesney to pry his foot loose as he squatted down on the stage while the band continued to play an extended introduction of the song. When Chesney finally freed himself, he stood up and held his hand on his knee as he began singing.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Chesney did not acknowledge the injury during the early part of his performance. However, he was visibly limping and seemed to rest near a drum riser while leaning over and holding his knee during the instrumental breaks of his songs. As he came offstage, a doctor from the [[University of South Carolina]] cut off Chesney's cowboy boot and immediately began treating the foot injury. X-rays that were taken afterwards revealed several crushed bones in his right foot.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

That injury did not have him cancel any shows, as saying "[the doctor] told me it's going to hurt – though nothing could hurt worse than Saturday, I don't think – and they can give me something to deaden the pain when I get out there. I also have to have a doctor standing by should something give, but I'm going to tape it up, and I'm going to get out there".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1586431/despite-injury-kenny-chesneys-tour-continues-as-planned.jhtml|title=Despite Injury, Kenny Chesney's Tour Continues As Planned|website=Cmt.com|access-date=27 July 2018}}</ref>

On May 19, 2008, just a day after being honored as the ACM Entertainer of the Year at the 43rd Annual Academy of Country Music Awards, Chesney criticized the lack of choice in the producers' awarding the honor based on fan votes. "The entertainer of the year trophy is supposed to represent heart and passion and an amazing amount of sacrifice, commitment and focus", he said. "That's the way [[Garth Brooks|Garth]] [Brooks] won it four times, that's the way I won it, that's the way [George] [[George Strait|Strait]] won it, [[Reba McEntire|Reba]] [McEntire], [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]] all those years. That's what it's supposed to represent."<ref>{{cite web|author=Calvin Gilbert |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1587688/kenny-chesney-criticizes-acm-for-fan-voting-in-entertainer-category.jhtml |title=News : Kenny Chesney Criticizes ACM for Fan Voting in Entertainer Category |website=Cmt.com|date=2008-05-19 |access-date=2011-10-10}}</ref>

Zellweger cited fraud as the reason in the related papers, and after media scrutiny of her use of the word "fraud," she qualified the use of the term, stating that it was "simply legal language and not a reflection of Kenny's character."
