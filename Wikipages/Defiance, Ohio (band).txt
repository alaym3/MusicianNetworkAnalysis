== History ==

By the time they recorded their first demo, bz joined on violin, and Sherri on cello. Their first album ''[[Share What Ya Got]]'' was self released on CDr and on vinyl by Friends and Relatives. It was later reissued on vinyl by [[No Idea]].<ref>{{cite web |title= Defiance, Ohio - Share What Ya Got (Vinyl, LP, Album) at Discogs |url= https://www.discogs.com/Defiance-Ohio-Share-What-Ya-Got/release/2423087 |website= Discogs |accessdate= 25 March 2017}}</ref> The band moved to [[Bloomington, Indiana]], released two split [[Extended play|EPs]] with Ghost Mice,<ref>{{cite web |title= Defiance, Ohio / Ghost Mice (CD, Album) at Discogs |url= https://www.discogs.com/Defiance-Ohio-Ghost-Mice-Defiance-Ohio-Ghost-Mice-Split/release/3723468 |website= Discogs.com |accessdate= 25 March 2017}}</ref> and [[One Reason (band)|One Reason]]<ref>{{cite web |title= One Reason / Defiance, Ohio - One Reason / Defiance Ohio at Discogs (CD, Album) at Discogs |url= https://www.discogs.com/One-Reason-Defiance-Ohio-One-Reason-Defiance-Ohio/master/316480 |website= Discogs.com |accessdate= 25 March 2017}}</ref> and toured the US extensively, as well as [[Iceland]].<ref>{{cite web |title= Past Shows - Defiance Ohio |url= http://defianceohio.terrorware.com/past-shows/ |accessdate= 25 March 2017}}</ref> In 2004 Will moved to [[Eureka, California]], and Theo Hilton filled in on drums. Will returned from California, and Theo stayed with the band, switching back and forth on drums and guitar.

''[[The Great Depression (Defiance, Ohio album)|The Great Depression]]'' was released in 2006 on [[No Idea]].<ref>{{cite web |title= Defiance, Ohio - The Great Depression at Discogos |url= https://www.discogs.com/Defiance-Ohio-The-Great-Depression/master/140123 |website= Discogs.com |accessdate= 25 March 2017}}</ref> After making the decisions to work with No Idea, the band felt a need to explain their actions and maintain the sense of dialogue that they feel has been consistent in how they have conducted themselves as a band. They said that they would have preferred to release the album themselves, but that they did not have the capacity to do so while continuing to keep older releases in print.<ref>{{cite web |title= Interviews: Defiance, Ohio |url= https://www.punknews.org/article/35595/interviews-defiance-ohio |website= PunkNews.org |publisher=Punk News |accessdate= 25 March 2017}}</ref>

In 2007 the band released a split EP with Environmental Youth Crunch,<ref>{{cite web|title=Defiance, Ohio / Environmental Youth Crunch - Defiance, Ohio / Environmental Youth Crunch (Vinyl) at Discogs|url=https://www.discogs.com/Defiance-Ohio-Environmental-Youth-Crunch-Defiance-Ohio-Environmental-Youth-Crunch-Split/release/1555071|website=Discogs|accessdate=26 March 2017}}</ref> and a full-length ''[[The Fear, the Fear, the Fear|The Fear, The Fear, The Fear]]'' on [[No Idea]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Defiance, Ohio - The Fear, The Fear, The Fear at Discogs|url=https://www.discogs.com/Defiance-Ohio-The-FearFearFear/master/140118|website=Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=26 March 2017}}</ref> Theo moved to [[Athens, Georgia]], while the band continued to practice, tour and write together, and they toured [[Australia]] for the first time.

In 2009 the band released 4 songs as a benefit for the [[Icarus Project]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Defiance, Ohio/Icarus Project Benefit!|url=http://dev.theicarusproject.net/story/defianceohioicarusprojectbenefit|website=The Icarus Project|accessdate=26 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327080330/http://dev.theicarusproject.net/story/defianceohioicarusprojectbenefit|archive-date=27 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Music: Defiance, Ohio launch donation site for "Songs for the Icarus Project 1"|url=https://www.punknews.org/article/32697/media-defiance-ohio-launch-donation-site-for-songs-for-the-icarus-project-1|website=Punknews.org|publisher=Punk News|accessdate=26 March 2017}}</ref> These songs were later remastered and released as part of the full-length ''[[Midwestern Minutes]]'' in 2010. Geoff relocated to Chicago. Due to band members moving to different cities, and starting other musical projects, activity has slowed down in recent years compared to consistent and extensive touring of earlier years. Their latest release is a 6-song EP, The Calling on [[No Idea]]. Their last tour was in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=DEFIANCE, OHIO TOUR MARCH 2015!|url=http://defianceohio.terrorware.com/2015/01/10/defiance-ohio-tour-march-2015/|accessdate=26 March 2017}}</ref>
