'''Suicideboys''' (stylized as '''$uicideboy$'''<!-- Please do not change capitalisation or stylisation -->) is an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] duo from [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]],<ref name=$BTB>{{cite web|title=The Break Presents: Suicideboys - XXL|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/04/suicideboys-interview-the-break/|date=April 7, 2017}}</ref> founded in 2014 by cousins '''Ruby da Cherry''' and '''Scrim''' (stylized as '''$crim'''). Via the music sharing platform [[SoundCloud]], the duo rose to popularity for their abrasive, self-produced beats, as well as their harsh lyrical content and themes prominently featuring [[substance use disorder]] and [[suicidal ideation]]. They own and operate their own label, G*59 Records, under which all of their music is distributed by [[Virgin Music Label & Artist Services]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.g59records.com/|title=G*59 RECORD$|website=www.g59records.com|access-date=January 2, 2019|archive-date=December 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181214021934/http://www.g59records.com/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The duo are considered one of the most popular acts in the [[underground rap]] scene, and are also considered to have a [[cult following]].<ref name=":2">{{cite web|url=https://thespinoff.co.nz/music/09-05-2017/who-are-uicideboy-and-how-do-they-sell-out-shows-around-the-world-including-auckland/|title=Who are $UICIDEBOY$ and how do they sell out shows around the world – including Auckland?|date=9 May 2017}}</ref> After several years of solely releasing [[Extended play|EPs]] and [[mixtape]]s, Suicideboys' debut studio album ''[[I Want to Die in New Orleans]]'' was released on September 7, 2018. It fared well commercially, becoming their first top-ten album on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name="US" /> In May 2019, they released their collaborative six-track EP with [[Blink-182]] drummer [[Travis Barker]] entitled ''Live Fast, Die Whenever''. It also prominently featured [[Korn]] guitarist [[James Shaffer]].<ref name=":4" />

== Early years and formation ==
'''$crim''' was born Scott Anthony Arceneaux Jr. on April 11, 1989 in [[Marrero, Louisiana]]. Arceneaux originally was inspired by [[T-Pain]] and [[Kanye West]] to produce music, buying his first laptop which he used to start [[disc jockey|DJing]] with money gained from selling drugs. Arceneaux's passion for DJing extended when he started to attend [[Delgado Community College]], where he was hired to DJ parties. He also worked selling used furniture, getting fired for his new hand tattoos after three years.<ref name="auto">{{Citation|last=No Jumper|title=No Jumper - The Suicide Boys Interview|date=2015-12-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zvj_U1JOOzA|access-date=2018-09-09}}</ref>

'''Ruby da Cherry''' was born Aristos Norman Petrou on April 22, 1990 to an American mother and [[Greek Cypriots|Greek Cypriot]] father Pavlos Petrou, a former [[association football]] head coach at [[Mount Carmel Academy (Louisiana)|Mount Carmel Academy]] who arrived in the country after obtaining an [[athletic scholarship]] to the [[University of New Orleans]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wgno.com/news/from-greece-to-mount-carmel-how-pavlos-petrou-built-a-winning-soccer-program/|title=From Greece to Mount Carmel: How Pavlos Petrou built a winning soccer program|date=February 23, 2017}}</ref> Raised in [[Metairie, Louisiana]], Petrou's interest in music began when he was seven, playing violin and then drums when he was ten, eventually joining bands in middle school. He worked at his father's restaurant as a waiter, a job he held until 2015.<ref name="auto" /> His experience with the [[punk rock]] scene continued as he joined the band ''Vapo-Rats'' as its drummer; however, disillusioned with the apathy his bandmates showed towards the future of the band, Petrou left in order to pursue a career in [[hip-hop]] with Arceneaux.

Arceneaux and Petrou are [[cousins]], and as such shared a close relationship growing up. Realising that both were interested in taking a musical career seriously, and both dissatisfied with the direction of their lives, the two formed Suicideboys, making a pact that if their musical career didn't work out, they would both commit [[suicide]].<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/uicideboy-mn0003530108/biography|title=$uicideboy$ Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|author=Yeung, Neil|access-date=August 3, 2018}}</ref> Elaborating on this in an interview with [[Mass Appeal (media)|Mass Appeal]], Arceneaux states that, “it was pretty much like cutting the hand, bleeding, and making a pact that there's no plan B, that if this doesn't happen by the time we’re 30, I'm blowing my head off”.<ref name=":2"/>

== Musical career ==
The duo's first project together, a three-track [[Extended play|EP]] named ''{{Proper name|Kill Yourself Part I: The $uicide $aga}}'', was released in June 2014 on SoundCloud and Bandcamp, attracting attention for their collaboration with notable underground rapper [[Bones (rapper)|Bones]]. In the following months, the duo released a further nine iterations of the ''Kill Yourself'' series.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}
After a number of collaboration EPs with fellow underground artist Black Smurf, their first full-length project titled ''Gray/Grey'' was released on March 3, 2015.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Suicideboys' underground breakthrough came with the release of 2015 EP ''$outh $ide $uicide'', a collaboration with established [[South Florida]] rapper [[Pouya (rapper)|Pouya]], which thrust the duo into the [[underground rap]] spotlight. As of October 2018, the tape has gained over 75 million track plays on streaming platform [[SoundCloud]] alone. The duo's first foray onto the mainstream musical charts came with the release of ''{{Proper name|Radical $uicide}}'' in the summer of 2016. The five-track EP, produced by EDM musician [[Getter (DJ)|Getter]], peaked at number 17 on the [[Hot Rap Songs|Billboard Rap charts]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/suicideboys|title=$uicideboy$ Chart History|magazine=Billboard}}</ref>

On September 7, 2018, their debut [[studio album]] ''[[I Want to Die in New Orleans]]'' was released.<ref name="XXL1" /><ref name="HNHH">{{cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/suicideboys-share-release-date-for-i-want-to-die-in-new-orleans-news.56231.html|title=$uicideBoy$ Share Release Date For "I Want To Die In New Orleans"|website=HotNewHipHop|date=July 31, 2018|access-date=August 3, 2018}}</ref> A statement posted by the duo's official [[Instagram]] account stated, "We started recording this album in the beginning of 2017. Initially we wanted to write about our experiences on the road and express how our lives had become slightly more extravagant."<ref name="HB">{{cite web|url=https://hypebeast.com/2018/8/suicideboys-carrollton-i-want-to-die-in-new-orleans-release-date-cover-juicy-j-stream|title=$UICIDEBOY$ Debut New "Carrollton" Single & Reveal 'I Want To Die in New Orleans' Release Date|website=Hypebeast|date=August 2018|access-date=August 3, 2018}}</ref>

Suicideboys have gained a [[cult following]] in the [[hip hop]] scene, in part due to their niche subject matter involving subjects scarcely seen in rap such as [[suicidal ideation]], [[satanism]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. As of August 2021, their most viewed music video on [[YouTube]] is for their song ''Paris'', reaching nearly 150 million views; ''Kill Yourself (Part III)'' is the song with the most plays on their [[Spotify]] page, with 322 million plays.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqtobIpZt68|title=$UICIDEBOY$ - PARIS|last=G*59 Records|date=22 December 2015|via=YouTube}}</ref> The duo were featured in Billboard's list titled "Billboard Dance's 15 Artists to Watch in 2017".<ref name="billboard">{{cite web|last1=Medved|first1=Matt|last2=Bein|first2=Kat|title=Billboard Dance's 15 Artists to Watch in 2017|date=March 15, 2017|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/7647002/artists-to-watch-dance-electronic-edm-2017|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=27 June 2017}}</ref>

In late 2018, a rumor arose that the group had broken up following a series of ominous tweets. However, they soon clarified that the tweets were in relation to "personal issues" facing Arceneaux, and that they had in fact not broken up.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.48628/title.uicideboy-spark-break-up-rumors-following-ominous-tweets#|title=$uicideBoy$ Spark Break-Up Rumors Following Ominous Tweets|last=http://hiphopdx.com|first=HipHopDX -|work=HipHopDX|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en-US}}</ref>

In May 2019, the group put this rumor to rest with the release of their six-track EP ''Live Fast, Die Whenever'' in collaboration with [[Blink-182]] drummer [[Travis Barker]], and prominently featuring [[Korn]] guitarist [[James Shaffer]].<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hysteriamag.com/uicideboy-team-travis-barker-korn-guitarist-munky-new-ep/|title=$UICIDEBOY$ // Team Up With Travis Barker And Korn Guitarist 'Munky' On New EP|author=The Editor|date=2019-05-28|website=Hysteria Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-24}}</ref>

In August 2021, after a hiatus of over a year, the duo released their second studio album ''Long Term Effects of Suffering''. The album was received well by their fans, while being divisive in general media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/suicideboys-long-term-effects-of-suffering/|title=Long Term Effects of SUFFERING Album Review|author=Nadine Smith|date=2021-08-20|website=Pitchfork|language=en-US|access-date=2021-11-16}}</ref> Shortly after the release of the album, the duo began the Grey Day Tour 2021 along with other members of G*59.

In November 2021, the duo were awarded with their first [[RIAA]] platinum single, as their hit song ''...And to Those I Love, Thanks for Sticking Around'' reached one million sales.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=%24uicideboy%24#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum|website=RIAA|access-date=2021-11-16}}</ref>

=== Side projects ===
Along with their work in Suicideboys, Petrou and Arceneaux have both released sporadic solo work as well as worked with other artists individually.

Before Suicideboys, Arceneaux was an aspiring solo hip-hop artist, releasing several mixtapes under the name $crim. These include ''Narcotics Anonymous'', ''#DrugFlow2'' and ''Patron Saint of Everything Totally Fucked'', all of which were released before the group's formation in 2014. Arceneaux has also worked as an in-house producer for [[Republic Records|Universal/Republic]], producing several songs for artists, including one song that was commercially successful.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2018/09/suicideboys-say-they-influenced-soundcloud-rap-coming-for-their-credit|title=Suicideboys Say They Influenced SoundCloud Rap—And They're Coming for Their Credit|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2018-09-13}}</ref> In 2020, Arceneaux released his first solo album since the formation of $uicideboy$. The album, ''A Man Rose from the Dead'', received mixed reviews among fans.

Petrou has released two solo mixtapes under the name Oddy Nuff da Snow Leopard; ''The Jefe Tape'' in 2012 and ''Pluto'' in 2014. ''Pluto'' contained the first collaboration between Arceneaux and Petrou on a commercial project; Arceneaux featured on the song ''Smoke a Sack''.

===Controversies===

Suicideboys have come under much criticism by mainstream music critics for their often abrasive and offensive image, including their name, lyrical content, and behaviour. Many of their songs contain themes and insinuations of [[Satanism|devil worship]]; however, as Arceneaux states on an interview with [[Adam Grandmaison]], their use of satanic imagery is simply a metonym for the negative effects of money, drugs, and other items that have the potential to manipulate people.<ref name="auto"/>

Arceneaux is a former [[opioid]] addict, claiming in his [[Adam Grandmaison|No Jumper]] interview that he would lure people to him on [[Craigslist]] in order to rob them just to feed his addiction.<ref name="auto"/>

In September 2016, Canadian DJ and record producer [[Deadmau5]] accused the duo of [[copyright infringement]] following the success of their song ''Antarctica'' (off of the 2016 mixtape ''Dark Side of the Clouds'').<ref>{{cite web|title=deadmau5 Clashes With 'Shadow Rap' Group $uicideboys$ Over Copyright Infringement|url=https://djmag.com/news/deadmau5-clashes-shadow-rap-group-suicideboys-over-copyright-infringement|date=September 8, 2016}}</ref> The song samples parts of Deadmau5's "[[I Remember (Deadmau5 and Kaskade song)|I Remember]]", with [[Kaskade]]; the DJ lambasted the duo for this, claiming that Suicideboys were "publicizing other people's intellectual property without consent".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/deadmau5/status/773376970281201669?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https://djmag.com/news/deadmau5-clashes-shadow-rap-group-suicideboys-over-copyright-infringement|title=Goat lord on Twitter}}</ref> The song, which had been out since January and subsequently reached millions of plays on both [[YouTube]] and [[SoundCloud]], was taken down by Suicideboys on both platforms and no further action was taken. However, in time for their upcoming Grey Day Tour 2021, ''Antarctica'' was cleared for streaming after nearly four years of being off streaming services in September 2021.

==Musical style==

The music of Suicideboys varies between different subgenres of [[rap]]; while some songs have melancholy tones with lyrical content that focuses on subjects such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[suicidal ideation]] (topics not widely exposed in rap music), others are wildly aggressive, with themes of violence and sexual content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dbknews.com/2016/12/12/suicideboys-rap-music/|title=Underground hip-hop duo $uicideboy$ deserves your attention}}</ref> Some of their music is based around life growing up in [[New Orleans]]; song titles such as ''[[Audubon, New Orleans|Audubon]]'', ''[[Tulane University|Tulane]]'', ''[[Elysian Fields Avenue|Elysian Fields]]'' and ''[[St. Bernard Projects|St. Bernard]]'' reflect streets and neighborhoods that influenced the life of Arceneaux and Petrou.

There is a clear [[Three 6 Mafia]] influence in much of their music, with many earlier Suicideboys songs using samples from the group's songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1964486/were-in-another-three-6-mafia-moment-and-that-is-a-beautiful-thing/franchises/status-aint-hood/|title=We're In Another Three 6 Mafia Moment, And That Is A Beautiful Thing|date=September 27, 2017}}</ref> While the use of Three 6 Mafia has been met with reservations by some of its former members, particularly [[Gangsta Boo]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2017/12/gangsta-boo-accuses-artists-of-stealing|title = Gangsta Boo Calls Out Rappers 'Stealing' Three 6 Mafia Songs|website = [[Complex Networks]]}}</ref> it has been embraced by others; founding member [[Juicy J]] has been vocal about his support and mentorship of Suicideboys, and enlisted the duo to produce his mixtapes ''Highly Intoxicated'' and ''ShutDaF*kUp'', featuring artists such as [[ASAP Rocky]], [[Cardi B]], [[Wiz Khalifa]] and [[XXXTentacion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/new-music/2018/01/juicy-j-shutdafkup-mixtape-suicideboys/|title=Juicy J Drops 'ShutDaF*kUp' Mixtape With Suicideboys and More - XXL|first=C. Vernon Coleman|last=II|website=XXL Mag}}</ref>

A large portion of their music focuses on [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and its symptoms, an angle not often received in mainstream [[hip hop]]; Arceneaux elaborated on this in an interview with [[Mass Appeal (media)|Mass Appeal]], stating, “A lot of people take it as emo, or depressed music, or negative music... it's really just connecting. It's therapy, through music".<ref name=":3">{{cite web|url=https://massappeal.com/suicideboys-open-space/|title=Open Space: $uicideBoy$|date=21 April 2017}}</ref>

Excluding occasional guest producers and usage of purchased instrumental loops, the entirety of Suicideboys' discography is self-produced, mainly by Arceneaux under his pseudonym Budd Dwyer (an homage to the [[Budd Dwyer|former politician of the same name]]). Arceneaux has produced tracks for multiple artists, including [[Denzel Curry]], [[Dash (rapper)|Dash]] and [[Juicy J]]; additionally, he states that he once held an in-house deal with [[Republic Records|Universal/Republic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2018/09/suicideboys-say-they-influenced-soundcloud-rap-coming-for-their-credit|title=Suicideboys Say They Influenced SoundCloud Rap—And They're Coming for Their Credit|website=[[Complex Networks]]}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Arceneaux and Petrou are quite secretive when it comes to their personal lives. However, they both refer to women they have dated in their songs, most notably being ''CLYDE (I Hope at Least One of My Ex-Girlfriends Hears This)''.

Arceneaux has a history of drug addiction, most notably being heroin. However, he claims to have been sober since February 2019. Arceneaux has stated that he maintains his sobriety by attending 12 Step programs and therapy sessions.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/amp/articles/indie/9649488/suicideboys-new-album-headlining-tour-2021-interview|title=How $uicideboy$ Became the Multi-Million Dollar Brand You Never Heard Of|date=2021-10-22|magazine=Billboard|accessdate=2021-11-16}}</ref>

Petrou has also dealt with drug addiction. He has not been as open about his addiction as Arceneaux, however he has been more vocal about his addiction after the release of ''Long Term Effects of SUFFERING''. After an intervention by their management, Petrou checked into a drug rehabilitation facility in October 2020. Petrou has stated he not completely sober, due to him continuing to smoke marijuana.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/amp/articles/indie/9649488/suicideboys-new-album-headlining-tour-2021-interview|title=How $uicideboy$ Became the Multi-Million Dollar Brand You Never Heard Of|date=2021-10-22|magazine=Billboard|accessdate=2021-11-16}}</ref>
