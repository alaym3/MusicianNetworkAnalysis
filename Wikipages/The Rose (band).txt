'''The Rose''' ({{ko-hhrm|더 로즈}}) is a South Korean band formerly under J&Star Company. The band is composed of four members: Kim Woo-sung (vocals, guitar), Park Do-joon (keyboard), Lee Ha-joon (drums), and Lee Jae-hyeong (bass).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://people.search.naver.com/search.naver?where=nexearch&sm=tab_ppn&query=%EB%8D%94%EB%A1%9C%EC%A6%88&os=6199489&ie=utf8&key=PeopleService|title=The Rose official 'Naver' profile}}</ref> Prior to its debut with J&Star, the band had long been a popular indie group before making its official mainstream release with "Sorry" on August 3, 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.soompi.com/2017/08/02/watch-popular-indie-band-rose-officially-debuts-sorry/0|title=Watch: Popular Indie Band The Rose Officially Debuts With "Sorry"|last=Soompi|date=2017-08-02|access-date=2018-01-23}}</ref>

==History==
=== 2015–2016: Early formation and busking days ===
Dojoon and Jaehyeong met as the two were [[busking]] in Hongdae. Often busy as a [[DSP Media]] trainee, Dojoon rarely had the time to meet with Jaehyeong and later confessed on a radio interview that he was not the type to disobey his management company.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0bptHrmef4|title=The Rose - Arirang Radio [Sound K] (Full Interview) 2017.08.28|last=YouTube|date=2017-08-28|access-date=2018-01-23}}</ref> Jaehyeong started busking with Hajoon later in the year after the two met while practicing in the same studio, and the duo set out in search of another member.

By the end of 2015, Jaehyeong recruited Dojoon, who had left his company and returned to busking. The trio started the indie band Windfall and began to write their own music, while posting musical covers on [[YouTube]] and performing in the streets. When the band decided to search for their fourth and final member, Dojoon worked to recruit Woosung, who he had met through a mutual friend.

In 2016, the band entered J&Star Company.

=== 2017–2018: Mainstream debut, Paint it Rose Tour, ''Void'' and ''Dawn'' ===

On August 3, 2017, the band debuted its mainstream single, "Sorry", penned by Hajoon{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} and under a new name, The Rose. Later that month, the [[Rolling Stone|Rolling Stone India]] lauded The Rose's single for being "a fantastic introduction to the band’s soft-rock vibe" and described "Woosung’s immense control over his raspy vocals... particularly impressive."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://rollingstoneindia.com/8-korean-rock-bands-may-surprise/0|title=8 Korean Rock Bands That May Surprise You|last=Rolling Stone India|date=2017-08-23|access-date=2018-01-23}}</ref> The group then made a subsequent comeback on October 31 with its second single, "Like We Used To."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.soompi.com/2017/10/31/watch-rose-makes-beautiful-return-mv-like-used/0|title=The Rose Makes Beautiful Return With MV For "Like We Used To"|last=Soompi|date=2017-10-31|access-date=2018-01-01}}</ref>

On December 14, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' named The Rose's "Sorry" as one of the best Korean pop songs of 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/events/year-in-music-2017/8070355/best-k-pop-songs-of-2017-top-20|title=The Best K-pop Songs of 2017: Critics' Picks|last=Billboard|date=2017-12-14|access-date=2017-12-30}}</ref> By this time, the music video had garnered over 3 million views on [[YouTube]], a startling number for an amateur group. Later that month, the band announced its first European tour titled Paint It Rose, they performed in Brussels, Moscow, Istanbul, London and Budapest throughout the month of February 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.facebook.com/mmtglobal/posts/1766186183401043|title=Get ready for THE ROSE 2018 Paint It Rose Tour in Europe!|last=My Music Taste|date=2017-12-21|access-date=2018-01-01}}</ref> Woosung later announced during a radio interview with Arirang K-Show that the tour had sold out.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aEljR61rG4|title=The Rose - Arirang Radio [ Sound-K ] Full Interview|last=YouTube|date=2018-12-23|access-date=2018-01-23}}</ref>

On January 5, 2018, The Rose performed at the ''Rolling Hall 23rd Anniversary Concert,'' alongside other established indie artists such as Cheeze, O.WHEN, and Fromm. The band showcased three new unreleased songs, titled "Baby," "OMG," and "ILY."

On January 12, the band was listed as one of the top 5 Korean breakout artists to watch in 2018 by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/8094045/new-kpop-breakout-artists-to-watch-in-2018|title=Top 5 New K-Pop Artists to Watch in 2018|last=Billboard|date=2018-01-12|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref> The article wrote that it is "rare for rock-leaning bands to make a major K-pop impression upon debut, but The Rose's gorgeously emotive "Sorry" was able to do that, scoring a spot on Billboard's year-end critics' song list and confirming themselves a multifaceted, new talent on the scene."

On January 24, [[Soompi]] announced The Rose as one of the nominees for Rookie of the Year for its 13th Annual Soompi Awards.

On March 17, the band headlined the closing ceremony concert of the 29th Korean American Students Conference, hosted by [[Northwestern University]] in Chicago.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hellokpop.com/event/the-rose-29th-korean-american-students-conference/|title=The Rose To Perform At 29th Korean American Students Conference|last=hellokpop|date=2017-12-21|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref>

On February 28, The Rose reportedly filed a lawsuit against J&Star Company to terminate their exclusive contract. In their suit, the band alleged that the agency failed to provide any payment since their debut and that it demanded a rigorous promotional schedule. The Rose cited J&Star's pledge to provide them with monthly revenue reports which never materialized, as well as the company's unilateral decision to plan a 17-city American tour spanning 32 days, which would have required a concert every other day.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Seon-myeong|script-title=ko:[단독] "정산도 못 받고 무리한 스케줄 강행" 더로즈, 소속사에 전속계약 해지 요구|url=http://sports.khan.co.kr/entertainment/sk_index.html?art_id=202002280951003|website=[[Sports Kyunghyang]]|publisher=Kyunghyang Company|access-date=February 29, 2020|language=Korean|date=February 28, 2020}}</ref> J&Star Company denied the accusations and plan to "take all necessary legal measures".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kim|first1=Hyo-jeong|script-title=ko:밴드 더로즈, 소속사에 전속계약 해지 요구|url=https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20200228129400005|website=Yonhap News|publisher=[[Yonhap News Agency]]|access-date=February 29, 2020|language=Korean|date=February 28, 2020}}</ref>

On March 4, J&Star Company released a secondary statement that refuted The Rose's claims and accusations against the company, saying the group was being deceptive, and broke integrity and dignity. The label stressed their intent to take counter legal actions for violation of contract, defamation of character, and more.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ytn.co.kr/_sn/0117_202003041542456307|title=더로즈 소속사 "전속계약 위반한 적 없다...기만·비방 법적 대응" (공식입장)|date=2020-03-04|website=www.ytn.co.kr|language=ko|access-date=2020-03-13}}</ref>

{{Quote|quote=Hello, Our lovely Blackroses 
It's already our third year walking together on this beautiful road to wherever the destination may be. Everyday has been such a blessing for us ever since we met. Thank you always for being by our side through all the ups and downs. 
With every journey there is a detour or a resting period. We think with the members going to the army, now is the right time for us to just sit where ever we are and enjoy the view that we were not able to see while moving forward. There are things we can learn and experience only when we stop and take the time to appreciate. We really hope that we can come out of this and tell you guys all about our experiences. 
Until then we have prepared a little gift for our blackroses, which we hope to reveal soon.

Following the release of his solo single "Lazy," Woosung revealed in an interview with ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' in June 2021 that The Rose has settled their lawsuit with J&Star and had been released from their contract, saying, “Everything’s been figured out...We’re not under contract with anyone any more. The [other] members are in the army and we’re waiting for them to come out. That’s all I can say.” He also stated that the band plans to remain together.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Herman|first=Tamar|date=June 29, 2021|title=K-pop-rock singer Woosung on new single ‘Lazy’, his band The Rose’s future and why he writes music|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/k-pop/bands/article/3139172/k-pop-rock-singer-woosung-new-single-lazy-his-band-roses|url-access=limited|url-status=live|access-date=July 1, 2021|website=[[South China Morning Post]]}}</ref>
