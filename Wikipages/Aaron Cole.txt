He began his career at the age of four. He signed to [[Gotee Records]], a record label founded by [[Christian hip hop]] performer [[Toby McKeehan]]. Cole is known the best for his songs "Right on Time" and "One More Day".

==Early and personal life==
Cole was raised in a musical family, where his dad had his own recording studio in their apartment. Around the time of his high school years, Cole discovered that music is his true vocation, and he wants to serve it as a professional rapper. "I remember in junior high just enjoying being a regular kid, but I would get picked on because I wasn't smoking, drinking, or getting in trouble," says Cole. "One afternoon I came home and told my dad what was going on and why, and he shared that he thought I was called for a purpose and that this calling would cost me to not be like everyone else. It was that moment that I encountered God for the first time for myself, and I knew I was born to do this and began writing and putting my own songs together."<ref>{{cite web|title=Introducing Aaron Cole on Gotee Records |url=http://www.gospelmusic.org/introducing-aaron-cole-on-gotee-records/|publisher=GospelMusic|author=GIMA|accessdate=August 16, 2018}}</ref> Cole currently resides in Bristol, VA

==Music career==
Cole began his career at the age of four. One day, his father wrote him a song called "Jesus is the Rock". It was also the title of his first CD, released in July 2003. Throughout his career he bridged the gap between rapping and singing. He has since released a total of six independent projects. He has featured on songs by [[Hollyn]] and [[DJ Maj]]. In 2016, Cole was inducted into Christian Hip Hop's top media outlet Rapzilla's Freshman Class and noted by Essence Magazine as one of 16 gospel artists to watch.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rapzilla.com's 15 Freshmen of 2016
