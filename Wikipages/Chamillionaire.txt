He joined [[Los Angeles]]-based venture capital firm [[Upfront Ventures]] in 2015 and has been focusing on his entrepreneurial career over his musical career since.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/chamillionaire-entrepreneur-in-residence-upfront-ventures-2015-2 |title=Chamillionaire is an entrepreneur-in-residence at Upfront Ventures |first=Maya |last=Kosoff |date=February 25, 2015 |work=[[Business Insider]] |access-date=March 9, 2015}}</ref>

==Early life==
Chamillionaire was born to a [[Muslim]] [[Nigerian-American|Nigerian]] father and an African-American [[Christians|Christian]] mother in [[Washington D.C.]], and moved to [[Houston, Texas]] at the age of four. Chamillionaire's parents separated in his early teenage years. He settled into the [[Acres Homes]] neighborhood of northwest Houston. He attended [[Jersey Village High School]] alongside rap partner [[Paul Wall]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.chron.com/entertainment/article/Where-Houston-rappers-went-high-school-alumni-rap-14384824.php |title=Where your favorite Houston rapper went to high school |first=Matt |last=Young |date=August 28, 2019 |newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]}}</ref>

Rap and other forms of [[secular music]], which his parents had highly opposed in their household, became very appealing to Chamillionaire, who was still in his teens at the time. Chamillionaire has stated that he was inspired by southern rap acts such as the [[Geto Boys]], [[8 Ball & MJG]], and [[UGK (Underground Kingz)|UGK]], as well as other national acts such as [[N.W.A]] and [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]]. At a young age, Chamillionaire, along with fellow rap music artist and childhood friend [[Paul Wall]], had decided to make music their careers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Biography of Chamillionaire |url=http://www.channelaka.tv/Biography/CHAMILLIONAIRE |year=2009 |website=Channelaka.tv |access-date=February 2, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/691iCycQm?url=http://www.channelaka.tv/Biography/CHAMILLIONAIRE |archive-date=July 9, 2012}}</ref> Chamillionaire has a brother, who is three years younger than him, Rasaq Seriki, who is also an occasional rapper and a past member of [[The Color Changin' Click]].

==Music career==
===1998&ndash;2004: Career beginnings===
Seriki's stage name Chamillionaire is a [[portmanteau]] of "[[chameleon]]" and "[[millionaire]]"<ref>{{cite web |last=Salt |first=Limara |title="Not a Criminal" – Review |url=http://www.ukmusic.com/reviews/hip-hop-and-rnb/chamillionaire-feat.-kelis-not-a-criminal.html |website=UKMusic.com |year=2007 |access-date=February 2, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824191431/http://www.ukmusic.com/reviews/hip-hop-and-rnb/chamillionaire-feat.-kelis-not-a-criminal.html |archive-date=August 24, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="nobody smiling"/> While promoting at an event, Seriki and fellow rapper [[Paul Wall]] met Michael "5000" Watts, a popular mixtape DJ from northern Houston. After proposing to do promotions for Watts's company [[Swishahouse]], Chamillionaire and Paul Wall came to Watts's studio and convinced Watts to allow them to freestyle on an intro to Watts's radio show on Houston hip-hop radio station [[KBXX|KBXX-FM]]. Watts, who himself was convinced to rap on the record, enjoyed the freestyle so much that he put the verses on one of his mixtapes. Soon, Seriki (performing as Chamillionaire) and Paul Wall became regular staples on Houston's mixtape circuit, appeared on several of Watts's mixtapes, and became permanent members of Swishahouse.<ref name="Musicremedy">{{cite web |title=Chamillionaire – The Sound of Revenge |url=http://www.musicremedy.com/c/Chamillionaire/album/The_Sound_of_Revenge-1802.html |website=MusicRemedy.com |year=2005 |access-date=February 2, 2008}}</ref>

===2003&ndash;2005: Fly Rydes and Record Label===
In addition to being a musician, Hakeem 'Chamillionaire' Seriki has embarked a business career and established himself as an entrepreneur in a number of industries.

We'll do videos and rent all kinds of cars and people will waste all kinds of money on them, and instead, they can come spend that money with me."

Seriki founded his own record label; [[Chamillitary Entertainment]]. Seriki created the label after he had left his previous record labels; [[Swishahouse]] and [[Paid In Full Entertainment]] as he was unsigned. It was distributed by [[Universal Records]] but has been independent since January 15, 2011, due to Chamillionaire and the label parting ways.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.enotes.com/topic/Chamillitary_Entertainment |title=Chamillitary Entertainment |work=eNotes |access-date=March 9, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503090656/http://www.enotes.com/topic/Chamillitary_Entertainment |archive-date=May 3, 2012}}</ref>

"I will go out and see people and everybody wants to make money, and I will meet video girls who want to live the good life and all, but it is like, you gotta have a plan, you know?" Chamillionaire stated. "That is why it's called Masterpiece Mind Frame because in the word mind frame, your MIND comes before your frame. Print modelling can turn into movies and other stuff, and you can just step all the way up the ladder. It's like that with males and females, and if you're trying to go somewhere, just walk up the ladder, you know, and take it to the next step."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dirtysouthrap.com/news/2006/12/19/chamillionaire-talks-new-album-business-plans/ |title=Chamillionaire Talks New Album, Business Plans |date=December 19, 2006 |website=DirtySouthRap.com |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130121205256/http://dirtysouthrap.com/news/2006/12/19/chamillionaire-talks-new-album-business-plans/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 21, 2013}}</ref>

This marks the first time an honor of this kind has been bestowed upon a rap artist.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/@SermonsDomain/life-after-rap-chamillionaires-successful-transition-into-tech-664f7393f579 |title=Life After Rap: Chamillionaire's Successful Transition Into Tech |first=Erich |last=Donaldson |date=July 26, 2016 |website=Medium}}</ref> Chamillionaire hopes that this pivotal new role will allow him to help usher in the next generation of tech entrepreneurs as well as continue to offer valuable advice and investment capital to worthy start-ups.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2015/02/22/here-are-the-details-about-our-newest-eir-chamillionaire/ |title=Here are the details of about our newest EIR |first=Mark |last=Suster |date=February 23, 2015 |website=Both Sides of the Table |access-date=February 24, 2015}}</ref> A spokesperson for Upfront Ventures has stated that; "Chamillionaire brings a wealth of expertise in this area to the table based on his own years of employing successful tech and marketing strategies as both an independent music artist and later a label partner with Universal Records. Add to that he has quietly been a fixture in the tech world for many years: attending major conferences both as a keynote and audience member, making him a sought-after promotional partner, advisor and potential investor. It was in this capacity that he met Upfront partner, [[Mark Suster]], in 2009, becoming one of the earliest co-investors in [[Maker Studios]], now a subsidiary of [[The Walt Disney Company]]."<ref name="auto">{{cite web |url=https://instagram.com/p/zd2K8fkpMw/ |title=Chamillionaire broadens his portfolio |first=Isiah |last=Carey |website=[[Instagram]] |access-date=February 24, 2015}}</ref> In a letter penned by Mark Suster explaining the week he's had at Upfront Ventures in Los Angeles, he explains the presence of Chamillionaire around the office.

===2017&ndash;present: Convoz===
Seriki teased that he was working on something bigger than music in summer 2017 as part of being an EIR at Upfront Ventures with a soft launch of the social media app. In February 2018, at the Upfront Summit, Seriki announced Convoz, a social media app which allows an influencer to connect directly with his fans.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://social.techcrunch.com/2018/02/11/chamillionaire-is-a-presentation-genius-has-a-new-app/ |title=Chamillionaire is a presentation genius, has a new app |first=Katie |last=Roof |date=February 12, 2018 |website=Techcrunch}}</ref> Seriki describes the app as a "the place where you go to talk to people." and the launch comes after he "just wasn't happy with the communication channels that are currently existing on social media." The app permits users to share 15-second clips, which are usually addressed to celebrities. The celebrities can then decide which fan or user they can reply to, individually or all to see. The startup has a total of seven employees, and has cultivated an undisclosed amount of seed funding from Greycroft Ventures, Upfront Ventures, [[500 Startups]], Precursor VC, Okapi Ventures, XG Ventures, and a roster of angels including Justin Kan and Snoop Dogg.

In May 2019, Seriki, in an interview with [[Yahoo! Finance]], announced that they are going to invest $25,000 into a startup founded and managed by a [[woman]] or [[person of color]] alongside rapper [[E-40]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rapper-chamillionaire-invests-in-startups-founded-by-women-and-people-of-color-125334655.html |title=Ridin' to success: Rapper Chamillionaire is investing in startups founded by women and people of color |first=Marabia |last=Smith |date=May 26, 2019 |website=Yahoo!

After seeing the success of his initial $25,000 investment pledge, Seriki and E-40 launched another, much larger, $100,000 competition for minority or woman start-ups. [[Shark Tank]] judge [[Daymond John]] and Republic.co also joined the team to narrow the search.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/11/rapper-chamillionaire-launches-competition-for-minority-start-ups.html |title=Grammy winning rapper Chamillionaire launches $100,000 competition for minority-founded start-ups |first=Brandon |last=Gomez |date=November 11, 2019 |website=CNBC}}</ref> The winner of the competition was Pierre Laguerre and it was announced in January 2020.

==Personal life==
{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#bbccff |salign=right |width=350px |align=right |quote =Everyday I watch the news and look at how crazy the world is. It humbles you to see other people's problems and to see the amount of adversity others seem to be going through. If you think you're going through hard times, you can always turn on the TV to see someone else who's going through things 10 times worse than you. But then again, the media will also dedicate a majority of their time focusing on topics that I feel are not as news worthy, often times making celebrity gossip their main focal point. I wanted to do a record with some social commentary but also not be too heavy handed when it comes to discussing the stuff that we should really be focusing on. I wanted to find the perfect balance and go right down the middle." |source =&ndash; Seriki, on his main focus of making music.<ref>{{cite web |title=Biography of Chamillionaire |url=http://www.chamillionaireonline.com/bio.asp |year=2007 |website=ChamillionaireOnline |access-date=February 2, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/691iCPEOV?url=http://www.chamillionaireonline.com/bio.asp |archive-date=July 9, 2012}}</ref>}}

On June 3, 2010 Chamillionaire's third mortgage property home was foreclosed on by the bank. The rapper told TMZ in a public video claiming to have given it back to the bank after paying just over US$2 million on it and claims it was a bad investment and he was never in it.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tmz.com/2010/06/03/chamillionaire-rapper-foreclosure-houston-texas-mansion/ |title=Chamillionaire -- I Chose to Be Foreclosed On |date=June 3, 2010 |website=TMZ}}</ref>

==Controversy==
===Paul Wall===
On November 19, 2004, Chamillionaire's younger brother, Rasaq Seriki, was allegedly attacked by [[Paul Wall]] and his entourage at a nightclub. Chamillionaire expressed his disappointment in Paul Wall, arguing that they all used to be family and that these events should not have happened. Before the entire incident between Paul Wall and Rasaq they were all part of the group called "[[The Color Changin' Click]]" which now has become fragmented. Chamillionaire released a diss track with Rasaq titled "Go Head".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6-4fbEgJwY | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701113159/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6-4fbEgJwY| archive-date=2013-07-01 | url-status=dead|title=Chamillionaire - Go Head (Feat. Rasaq) [Paul Wall Diss] |website=YouTube |access-date=September 25, 2012}}</ref>

The dispute ended in 2010, when the pair reunited for a full tour. Paul Wall stated "It took a long time and us growing. You know, we started off as a group and a lot of times when you go your separates ways, a lot of people say, "Oh you can't do it without him" and so you wanna prove them wrong. I know for me, I wanted to prove everyone wrong and prove that I could make it on my own." Chamillionaire replied; "We had been bumping into each other a lot. It's kinda been died down for a little bit now but we just kinda needed that stamp of approval. I think the tour kinda just solidifies it for other people. It's not like today we just stopped beefing, we stop beefing a long time ago, but nobody believed us."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ballerstatus.com/2010/03/24/paul-wall-chamillionaire-discuss-moving-past-beef-jealousy-over-each-others-success/ |title=Paul Wall & Chamillionaire discuss moving past beef; jealousy over each others success |website=BallerStatus.com |access-date=September 25, 2012 |date=2010-03-24}}</ref>
