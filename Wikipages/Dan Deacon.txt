==Life and education==
Deacon was born and raised in [[West Babylon, New York]] on [[Long Island]]. He graduated from Babylon High School in 1999 where he was a member of the local ska band Channel 59 alongside Tim Daniels of [[The Complete Guide to Everything]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://channel59.tripod.com/dan.html|title=Dan Deacon- King Dork!|publisher=Channel59.tripod.com|access-date=2012-09-16}}</ref> He later attended the [[College or university school of music|Conservatory of Music]] at [[State University of New York at Purchase]] in [[Purchase, New York|Purchase]], New York where, in addition to performing his solo material, he played in many bands, including [[tuba]] for [[Langhorne Slim]] and guitar in the improvisational [[grindcore]] band Rated R, and had a small mixed chamber ensemble. He completed his graduate studies in [[Electro-acoustic music|electro-acoustic]] and [[computer music]] composition. He studied under composer and conductor [[Joel Thome]] and [[Dary John Mizelle]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/rat-theremin-dan-deacon|title=Finally, a Theremin for Rats|website=Atlas Obscura|language=en|access-date=2019-09-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2011/01/dan-deacon-a-pied-piper-of-pop-becomes-a-classical-prince-hal-067223|title=Dan Deacon: A Pied Piper of pop becomes a classical Prince Hal|website=Politico|language=en|access-date=2019-09-23}}</ref>

In 2004 he moved to [[Baltimore, Maryland]] and moved into the [[Copycat Building]] and, along with friends from SUNY Purchase, formed [[Wham City]], an arts and music collective.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=13624|title=Crazy Diamonds: Wham City Doesn't Want To Take Over The World-But It Just Might Anyway |work=[[Baltimore City Paper]] |access-date=2012-09-16}}</ref>

==Career==
===Early student work===
His first two releases as a solo artist, ''Meetle Mice'' and ''Silly Hat vs Egale Hat'' were released on [[CD-R]] on Standard Oil Records in 2003 while he was a student at SUNY Purchase. The albums are collections of both computer music and live recordings of ensemble pieces, and are markedly different from the electronic-pop body of work that began with his first popular record, 2007's ''[[Spiderman of the Rings]]'', in that most of the pieces are instrumentals and sound collages, and they contain almost no tracks where Deacon sings or uses vocal manipulation.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

He followed those two albums with a set of records made up of [[sine wave]] compositions, ''Green Cobra Is Awesome Vs The Sun'' and ''Goose on the Loose''. His next two releases were the EPs ''Twacky Cats'' on Comfort Stand Recordings and ''Acorn Master'' on Psych-o-path Records.

===Studio albums===

''[[Spiderman of the Rings]]'' was Deacon's first commercially distributed full-length album, released by [[Carpark Records]] in May 2007.<ref>Hughes, Josiah.[https://archive.today/20120708052753/http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=131&csid2=4&fid1=37466 "Dan Deacon's High Art Dance Party"], ''[[Exclaim!]]'', April 2009.</ref> The album was well received<ref>Marc Hogan, "[http://www.spin.com/reviews/dan-deacon-spiderman-rings-carpark Dan Deacon, 'Spiderman of the Rings' (Carpark): Baltimore Goofball Packs Ingenious Sonic Punch]", Spin.com; accessed September 11, 2009.</ref> and was included in the Best New Music section of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10207-spiderman-of-the-rings/|title=Dan Deacon – Spiderman of The Rings Album Review|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=23 September 2019}}</ref> The album was ranked as number 24 on the website's "Top 50 Albums of 2007".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/6753-top-50-albums-of-2007/3/|title=Staff Lists|work=Pitchfork|access-date=November 4, 2014}}</ref> ''Spiderman of the Rings'' marked the beginning of Deacon's body of recorded work as an electronic-pop musician; Deacon has stated the success of this record "completely changed my life in every possible way."<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/citypaper/bcpnews-q-a-with-dan-deacon-20171010-htmlstory.html|title=Q&A: Dan Deacon on the 10th anniversary of 'Spiderman of the Rings' and 'Ultimate Reality,' the state of DIY, and more|work=Baltimore City Paper|access-date=September 24, 2019}}</ref> 

The collaborative video-art piece ''Ultimate Reality'' was released as a DVD in November 2007 by [[Carpark Records]] and marked a return to composing music for others to perform. The pieces for percussion and electronics were performed by Jeremy Hyman of [[Ponytail (band)|Ponytail]] and Kevin Omeara of Videohippos. The sonic pieces were set to collaged and heavily altered video created by Deacon's long time friend and collaborator [[Jimmy Joe Roche]].<ref name="auto1"/> 

Deacon's next album, entitled ''[[Bromst]]'', was released on March 24, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carparkrecords.com|title=Carpark Records|access-date=4 November 2014}}</ref> It was produced by Chester Gwazda at Snow Ghost Studios in Whitefish, Montana and features live instruments including player piano and a variety of percussion instruments.

His album ''[[America (Dan Deacon album)|America]]'' was released on August 28, 2012, on [[Domino Recording Company|Domino Records]] in the US. Deacon has described the album as representing his conflicted feelings toward the country and world he calls home: "The inspiration for the music was my love of cross-country travel, seeing the landscapes of the United States, going from east to west and back again over the course of seasons. "The lyrics are inspired by my frustration, fear and anger towards the country and world I live in and am a part of. As I came closer to finishing the album these themes began to show themselves more frequently and greater clarity. There seemed no better world to encapsulate both inspirations than the simple beauty found in the word America."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dandeacon.com|title=America |publisher=Dan Deacon|access-date=2012-09-16}}</ref>

''[[Gliss Riffer]]'' was released on Domino Records on February 25, 2015. Deacon describes the album title as "something that auto-correct wants to make sure that no one can actually type." The album was produced by Deacon alone, who notes that he created the album "trying to confront my own anxieties or insecurities and the stresses in my life." ''Gliss Riffer'' yielded the singles "Feel the Lightning" and "Learning to Relax", as well as a viral video animated in the [[exquisite corpse]] style for "When I Was Done Dying", produced by [[Adult Swim]] and featuring the work of nine different animators.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuJqUvBj4rE|title=DDWIWDD (Dan Deacon "When I Was Done Dying") &#124; Off The Air &#124; Adult Swim|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> ''Gliss Riffer'' received four-star reviews from both ''The Guardian''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/19/dan-deacon-gliss-riffer-review|title=Dan Deacon: Gliss Riffer review – pop outsider relaxes into his own sound|first=Lanre|last=Bakare|date=February 19, 2015|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref> and ''AllMusic''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/gliss-riffer-mw0002801141|title=Gliss Riffer - Dan Deacon &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic}}</ref> In his A- review of the album for ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'', Derek Staples noted that "the universal motifs of his discography are now refracted through a more personal lens", and praised the record's "new lyrical depth".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2015/02/album-review-dan-deacon-gliss-riffer/|title=Dan Deacon – Gliss Riffer: Album Review|work=[[Consequence of Sound]]|access-date=23 September 2019}}</ref>

===Live shows===
[[File:Dan Deacons Equipment.jpg|thumbnail|right|Dan Deacon's equipment, February 26, 2008]]

In stark contrast to Deacon's electronic performances, the Bromst tour was with a 14-person ensemble of members of various Baltimore bands including [[So Percussion]], [[Future Islands]], and Chester Gwazda. He was accompanied by various acts including Nuclear Power Pants. This tour is also notable for the musicians' use of a [[biofuel|vegetable oil]] powered bus.

In the summer of 2009, Dan Deacon went on tour with two other notable acts, [[Deerhunter]], and [[No Age]], on the "No Deachunter" tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/35480-no-agedeerhunterdan-deacon-super-mega-awesome-tour-dates-revealed/|title=Pitchfork: No Age/Deerhunter/Dan Deacon Super Mega Awesome Tour Dates Revealed|work=Pitchfork|access-date=November 4, 2014}}</ref> 

In the fall of 2009, Dan Deacon was forced to cancel the small remainder of his North American tour, which included shows at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in [[Troy, New York]] and [[Connecticut College]] in [[New London, Connecticut]] due to health complications involving a battle with acute [[sciatica]], all of which were rescheduled in winter of 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/37112-dan-deacon-hospitalized-with-back-problems-shows-canceled|title=Pitchfork: Dan Deacon Hospitalized With Back Problems, Shows Canceled|work=Pitchfork|access-date=November 4, 2014}}</ref>

Deacon has stated numerous times that this is not true.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/35868-dan-deacon-on-the-drinking-out-of-cups-video-i-have-never-done-acid|title=Dan Deacon on the 'Drinking Out of Cups' Video: 'I Have Never Done Acid'|website=Pitchfork|date=2009-07-09|access-date=2010-04-13}}</ref>

===Film composer and curator===
In September 2010, Deacon collaborated with video artist [[Jimmy Joe Roche]] at the [[Incubate (festival)|Incubate festival]] in [[Tilburg]], The Netherlands. While in residency there, Deacon and Roche worked on a new piece of video art. Material was shot at 't Schop, a farm in [[Hilvarenbeek]], and in the area surrounding [[Tilburg]]. During the festival, the movie was shown at the farm before Deacon's performance.

Together with Jimmy Joe Roche and film critic Eric Allen Hatch, Dan Deacon curated and hosted the [[Maryland Film Festival#Gunky's Basement Film series|Gunky's Basement Film Series]], a [[Maryland Film Festival]] series of films that are favorites of these friends and collaborators, including ''[[RoboCop]]'', ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', and ''[[Something Wild (1986 film)|Something Wild]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/citypaper/bcpnews-gunky-s-basement-returns-with-a-slate-of-films-at-the-parkway-20170601-story.html|title=Gunky's Basement returns with a slate of films at the Parkway|website=The Baltimore Sun|language=en|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref>

Deacon's score for [[Theo Anthony]]'s 2017 documentary ''[[Rat Film]]'' was issued on October 13, 2017 as the inaugural release on the new Domino Soundtracks imprint.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dominomusic.com/news/us/dan-deacon-announces-rat-film-original-soundtrack/|title=Dan Deacon announces Rat Film (Original Soundtrack)|website=Domino Music|language=en|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref> During the recording of the score, Deacon experimented with the rodent subjects, placing rats onto a custom fiberglass table with sensors on each corner. "I thought it would be interesting to set up a group of theremins to be controlled by rats moving around an enclosure (the volumes and pitches would always be fluctuating based on where/how the rats moved)", he explained in a statement. "Using the data and patterns collected from the rat Theremin performance, as well as impulse data from recordings of rat brain activity, I began to compose the bulk of the score."

In November 2018, Deacon released ''Time Trial'', his original soundtrack score to Finlay Pretsell's cycling documentary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/dan-deacon-scores-new-cycling-documentary-time-trial-listen/|title=Dan Deacon Scores New Cycling Documentary Time Trial: Listen|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=2019-06-29}}</ref> Deacon's scores for both ''Rat Film'' and ''Time Trial'' were nominated for Best Original Score in the annual [[Cinema Eye Honors]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cinemaeyehonors.com/press/here-are-all-the-nominees-for-the-12th-annual-cinema-eye-honors/|title=Here are all the Nominees for the 12th Annual Cinema Eye Honors|website=Cinema Eyey|language=en|access-date=2019-09-24}}</ref>
