==History==
===1980s===
The group formed in [[East Orange, New Jersey]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2016/07/naughty_by_nature_returns_to_nj_hometown_to_celebr.html|title=Naughty by Nature returns to N.J. hometown to celebrate 25th anniversary|work=NJ.com|access-date=2018-01-18|language=en-US}}</ref> in 1986 as '''The New Style.''' The group first appeared on the music scene in 1989, releasing an album called ''[[Independent Leaders]]'', and the album generated the minor hit "Scuffin' Those Knees". After the release of their first album, the group was mentored by fellow New Jersey native [[Queen Latifah]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mp3.com/artist/naughty-by-nature/summary/ |title=Naughty By Nature MP3 Downloads - Naughty By Nature Music Downloads - Naughty By Nature Music Videos - Naughty By Nature Pictures |website=MP3.com |access-date=2010-09-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629033916/http://www.mp3.com/artist/naughty-by-nature/summary/ |archive-date=2010-06-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and subsequently changed their name.

===1990s===
Naughty by Nature's first hit was "[[O.P.P. (song)|O.P.P.]]", which sampled the [[Jackson 5]]'s hit "[[ABC (The Jackson 5 song)|ABC]]" and was released in 1991 on their self-titled album ''[[Naughty by Nature (album)|Naughty by Nature]]''. All keyboards, co-production and programming were performed by David Bellochio in his Marion Recording Studio in Fairview, New Jersey.{{cn|date=October 2019}} The track peaked at #6 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]],<ref name="allmusic.com">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p78/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}} |title=((( Naughty by Nature > Charts & Awards > Billboard Singles ))) |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2010-09-15}}</ref> and was named one of the top 100 rap singles of all time in 1998 by ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'' magazine,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/source.htm#singles |title=Rocklist.net...The Source 100 Best Rap Albums & Singles |website=Rocklistmusic.co.uk |access-date=2010-09-15}}</ref> and being ranked the 20th best single of the 1990s by ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/spin100.html#Various |title=Rocklist.net...Spin Magazine (USA) Lists...Page 2 |website=Rocklistmusic.co.uk |access-date=2010-09-15}}</ref> The album generated another hit with a reworking of [[Bob Marley]]'s "[[No Woman No Cry]]" called "[[Everything's Gonna Be Alright (Naughty by Nature song) |Everything's Gonna Be All Right]]" (the track was also called "Ghetto Bastard" on some explicit releases). That song detailed the experiences of Treach growing up in poverty, and now rising up to live a better life.  Powered by the success of that song and "O.P.P.", their self-titled album went [[platinum certification|platinum]].

Fellow New Jersey native [[Tony D]] accused Naughty by Nature of stealing a sample from his album ''Music Makes You Move'' and using it on "O.P.P." The matter was settled out of court.{{cn|date=October 2019}} Naughty by Nature scored a hit with the track "[[Uptown Anthem]]" from the soundtrack to the 1992 film ''[[Juice (film)|Juice]]'', in which Treach had a cameo appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1432607/19990210/naughty_by_nature.jhtml |title=News - Articles - 1432607 - 19990210 |website=Mtv.com |date=1999-02-10 |access-date=2010-09-15}}</ref> Treach began to pursue an acting career after befriending [[Tupac Shakur]] on the set of ''Juice'', and Naughty by Nature appeared in the 1993 film ''[[The Meteor Man (film)|The Meteor Man]]'' as a street gang. After Shakur died in 1996, Treach recorded a tribute song titled "[[Mourn You Til I Join You]]."

Later, the group had multiple hits from its third and fourth albums, called ''[[19 Naughty III]]'' and ''[[Poverty's Paradise]]'' respectively. Both albums reached the #1 spot on the R&B/Hip-Hop Charts. "[[Hip Hop Hooray]]" was a success from the album ''[[19 Naughty III]]''. Its video was directed by [[Spike Lee]] and featured cameos by [[Queen Latifah]], [[Eazy-E]], [[Run-D.M.C.]], and [[Da Youngstas]]. ''[[Poverty's Paradise]]'' won the Grammy Award in 1996 for [[Best Rap Album]], becoming the first album to win this award.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p78/charts-awards/grammy-awards|pure_url=yes}} |title=((( Naughty by Nature > Charts & Awards > Grammy Awards ))) |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2010-09-15}}</ref> It also spawned a hit song in "[[Feel Me Flow]]" which peaked at #17 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="allmusic.com"/>

They produced a remix of the Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson song "[[Scream (Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson song)|Scream]]" in 1995.

In the mid-1990s Naughty by Nature started their own music imprint, Illtown Records,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608001143/Naughty-by-Nature.html |title=Naughty by Nature Biography |website=Musicianguide.com |access-date=2010-09-15}}</ref> and in 1995 released an album from their protégés the [[Rottin Razkals]]. The group (mainly Kay Gee & David Bellochio) worked closely with a number of R&B groups over the next few years particularly [[Zhané]] and [[Next (band)|Next]]. Kay Gee produced Next's "[[Too Close (Next song)|Too Close]]", which became a #1 hit in 1998.{{cn|date=October 2019}}

In 1999 the group released its fifth album, titled ''[[Nineteen Naughty Nine: Nature's Fury]]''. The album was fairly successful, being certified Gold by the RIAA, and spawned the hit "Jamboree" that peaked at #10 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="allmusic.com"/>

===2000–2012===
After the release of ''[[Nineteen Naughty Nine: Nature's Fury]]'', a dispute regarding finances developed between Kay Gee and [[Treach]]. [[Treach]] blamed Kay Gee for squandering the group's finances. Due to these disagreements DJ Kay Gee decided to leave Naughty by Nature in late 2000.  He started to develop his own record label Divine Mill. In 2001 the group released a song 'Here Comes The Money' that has constantly been used as the entrance theme for [[Shane McMahon]] in [[WWE]]. The remainder of the group, [[Treach]] and Vin Rock, released an album in 2002 called ''[[IIcons]]''. Due to Kay Gee's absence, the group used a variety of different producers including [[Da Beatminerz]]. The album, however, received a lukewarm reception from the public. In 2002, the group disbanded.
In May 2006, Kay Gee reunited with [[Treach]] and rejoined Naughty by Nature at a concert at [[B.B. King]]'s nightclub.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ilovepwnage.com/video.php?v=MjQxMzI |title=Hip Hop Videos |website=iLovePwnage.com |access-date=2010-09-15 }}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In April 2010 they released the single "Get to Know Me Better", featuring rapper [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]],  while the B-side of the single was called "I Gotta Lotta". Later in 2010 they released the group's first mixtape, ''[[Naughty by Nature: Tha Mixtape]]''. In 2011 the group worked on their long-delayed seventh group album, and it finally saw release. Titled ''[[Anthem Inc. (album)|Anthem Inc.]]'', it came out December 13, 2011.<ref name="prefixmag1">{{cite web |url=http://www.prefixmag.com/reviews/naughty-by-nature/anthem-inc/41232/ |title=Naughty by Nature: Anthem Inc.

On June 11, 2011, Naughty by Nature became the first hip-hop group to perform at the esteemed baseball stadium [[Fenway Park]]. They performed "[[Hip Hop Hooray]]" as part of the mega boyband [[NKOTBSB]]'s concert.

In March 2012, following the release of a documentary on fellow New Jersey based hip hop group [[Sugar Hill Gang]], Naughty by Nature performed in Asbury Park, NJ at the Garden State film festival.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wilkinson|first=Carlton|title=Garden State Film Festival Opens March 22 in Asbury Park|url=http://www.app.com/article/20120319/NJENT01/303190002/Garden-State-Film-Festival-oepns-March-22-Asbury-Park|access-date=April 11, 2012|newspaper=Asbury Park Press}}</ref>

===2013–present: Breakup and reconciliation===

In May 2013, frontman Treach shocked fans when he revealed that Vin Rock had been "fired" from the group, after failing to put in the same amount of energy in the group as himself and member DJ Kay Gee. At the time, Treach said he and Vinnie hadn't been on speaking terms for around two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ballerstatus.com/2013/05/13/treach-explains-vinnie-booted-naughty-nature-fallout-exclusive/|title=Treach Explains Why Vinnie Is Booted From Naughty By Nature|website=BallerStatus.com|date=May 13, 2013}}</ref>

In April 2015, Treach said he and Vinnie had resolved their issues, but now their relationship is strictly "business". "You got teammates, sometimes, that's on the same team, they may not feel each other. At the end of the day, you going out to win. That's what we doing", Treach said. Although Vinnie and Treach are cordial, he said another Naughty by Nature album was unlikely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ballerstatus.com/2015/04/28/ddtv-treach-addresses-status-of-naughty-by-nature/|title=Treach Addresses Status Of Naughty By Nature|website=BallerStatus.com|date=April 28, 2015}}</ref>

In January 2016, in celebration of their 25th anniversary, Naughty by Nature posted the video of their song "God is Us" from ''Anthem Inc.'' to their YouTube account.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ballerstatus.com/2016/01/19/naughty-by-nature-ft-queen-latifah-god-is-us-video/|title=Naughty By Nature ft.

On May 2, 2019, the Mixtape Tour commenced in Cincinnati, OH. Performers on this tour include Naughty by Nature, [[Salt-N-Pepa]], [[Debbie Gibson]], and [[Tiffany Darwish|Tiffany]], with [[New Kids on the Block]] being billed as the headline performers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/new-kids-on-the-block-mixtape-tour-734118/ |title=New Kids on the Block Set 'MixTape' Tour With Salt-N-Pepa, Naughty by Nature |first=Daniel |last=Kreps |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=October 8, 2018 |access-date=June 27, 2019}}</ref>
