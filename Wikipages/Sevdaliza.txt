The title of the EP is about how people responded to Sevdaliza in social situations, saying "I realized that those things that deflect me from social situations—not getting along with your coach or your boss or whatever—it made me realize I had to choose a different path."<ref name="factmag"/> ''The Suspended Kid'' was produced by Sevdaliza and [[Rotterdam]]-based producer and frequent collaborator, Mucky. In September, a music video for the last remaining track on the EP, the [[Industrial music|industrial]] [[contemporary R&B|R&B]]<ref name="factmag"/> "That Other Girl", was released.<ref name="ThatOtherGirl-video"/> In June, she released "Marilyn Monroe", which served as the lead single from her second EP, ''Children of Silk''. The song has been characterized as [[trip hop]]<ref name="factmag"/> and was accompanied by a music video which was released in March 2016.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kameir |first=Rawiya |url=http://www.thefader.com/2016/03/30/sevdaliza-marilyn-monroe-video |title=Watch Sevdaliza Morph Into Her Future Self In The "Marilyn Monroe" Video |work=The Fader |date=30 March 2016 |access-date=23 December 2017}}</ref> ''Children of Silk'' was released in November.

[[File:Sevdaliza (184251).jpg|thumb|Sevdaliza performing in [[Oslo]] (2016)]]
In January 2017, Sevdaliza released her first Persian-language song, "Bebin",<ref>{{cite web |last=Romaine |first=Jenna |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/politics/7677096/iranian-dutch-singer-sevdaliza-immigration-ban-bebin |title=Iranian-Dutch Singer Sevdaliza on How Immigration Ban Inspired Her Reflective Song 'Bebin' |work=Billboard |date=1 February 2017 |access-date=23 December 2017}}</ref> in response to [[Executive Order 13769]]. She stated, "In protest of the inhumane political climate, I could not rest my head in privilege. I wrote 'Bebin' in Farsi (referring to [[Persian language|Persian]]), to solidify. I stand strong with love. In this case I choose to avoid mainstream media, because I have no interest in part taking in a victimized concept. Take this message without lights, camera, action. I am solely a messenger. In the brain of love, there is no place for racism nor bigotry."<ref>{{cite web |last=Lobenfeld |first=Claire |url=http://www.factmag.com/2017/01/30/sevdaliza-shares-new-song-bebin-response-muslim-ban/ |title=Sevdaliza shares new song 'Bebin' in response to Muslim ban |work=Fact |date=30 January 2017 |access-date=23 December 2017}}</ref> In February, a music video was released for "Amandine Insensible", which showcases the limited roles women are expected to fill in modern culture. Sevdaliza said, "The story of Amandine explores the concept of 'identity' in a contemporary world that is rapidly changing due to the disappearance of 'boundaries'. Amandine is everything you want her to be. An extreme extraction of average life, representing a world where we have become so universal all feelings have disappeared. Paradoxically, this makes you feel uncomfortable. Her life takes place in an infinite white space, composed with minimal objects that represent different facets of the cycle of daily life."<ref name="Amandine-video"/> In April, "Hero" was released as the second single from her debut studio album, ''ISON''.<ref name="Hero-single"/> The album was released in April 2017, and is named after [[Comet ISON]], a [[sungrazing comet]].<ref name="Fader-interview"/>

In January 2018, Sevdaliza released a new track "Soul Syncable" and it was released on the day of the super blue moon. "Soul Syncable" is the first song from Sevdaliza, following her debut album ''ISON''. In February, she released the track "Human Nature". "Soul Syncable" and "Human Nature" are part of her EP ''[[The Calling (Sevdaliza EP)|The Calling]]'', which was released in March.

In May, she released a [[Portuguese language|Portuguese-language]] version of her track "Human", titled "Humana", to celebrate and thank its 10 million views.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Matos |first1=Alexandra Oliveira |title=Sevdaliza no SBSR'18: humana e independente |url=https://www.rimasebatidas.pt/sevdaliza-no-sbsr18-humana-e-independente/ |work=Rimas e Batidas |date=22 July 2018 |language=pt-PT}}</ref>

=== 2019-present: ''Shabrang'' ===
On March 8, 2019, Sevdaliza released a new single which would be the beginning of a new musical chapter in her career, "Darkest Hour". It was succeeded by another standalone single "Martyr" the following month.

Sevdaliza then released three singles in 2020, "Oh My God", "Lamp Lady" and "Joanna", before announcing her second studio album ''[[Shabrang (album)|Shabrang]]'', which released 28 August 2020. ''Shabrang'' also features the single "Human Nature", which also appeared on her 2018 extended play ''The Calling''.

==Musical style and influences==
Sevdaliza's music incorporates [[Electronic music|electronic]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/rdz5eq/sevdaliza-children-of-silk-ep-premiere |title=PREMIERE: Sevdaliza's 'Children of Silk' EP Shows Strength in the Face of Confusion |website=[[Noisey]] |date=24 November 2015 |access-date=23 December 2017}}</ref> [[alternative R&B]],<ref name="wmagazine">{{cite web |last=Munzenrieder |first=Kyle |url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/sevdaliza-visual-album-ison |title=Iranian Singer Sevdaliza's Surprise Visual Album ''ISON'' Belongs in an Art Gallery |work=[[W (magazine)|W]] |date=26 April 2017 |access-date=23 December 2017}}</ref> [[trip hop]],<ref name="wmagazine"/> [[experimental pop]],<ref name="Fader-ISON"/> and [[avant-pop]].<ref name="Fader-interview"/> Critics have compared her music to the trip hop of [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]] with string arrangements recalling [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] circa "[[Dazzle (song)|Dazzle]]" and ''[[Homogenic]]''-era [[Björk]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Music Review: Sevdaliza's EP 'The Calling'|url=https://variety.com/2018/music/reviews/music-review-sevdalizas-the-calling-ep-1202739977/ |date=30 March 2018 |first=Jem |last=Aswad |work=Variety|access-date=30 March 2018}}</ref>

According to Sevdaliza, "I think my sound would mostly be described as pure and raw. I'm not necessarily drawn to a genre, but to a process, or towards a certain mood like melancholy. The interesting thing is that the music my music gets compared to is not necessarily music I've listened to, which makes it super interesting. I was performing once, and a conservatory professor came to me after the show, saying that he could really hear that I draw inspiration from old Persian singers. I asked him, "Wow, that's really interesting. How do you hear that?," and he said because I use certain semitones and microtones when I sing. But I've never had a singing lesson in my life, and I've never listened to Persian music in my life! It's really interesting to me that some things just come to you unconsciously like that. It's like you have this brain and it's unconsciously and consciously registering everything and in combination with your DNA it just becomes... something."<ref name="papermag">{{Cite news|url=http://www.papermag.com/a-chat-with-sevdaliza-about-magic-vulnerability-and-baring-it-all-2386740911.html|title=A Chat with Sevdaliza about Magic, Vulnerability, and Baring it All|last=Stegemoeller|first=Kristen|date=4 May 2017|work=[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]|access-date=1 March 2018}}</ref>

Sevdaliza's music is inspired by ideas of womanhood, identity, and motherhood.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/35581/1/sevdaliza-ison-interview|title=Sevdaliza on Motherhood, Mystery, and Metaphor|last=Philips|first=Lior|date=12 April 2017|work=[[Dazed]]|access-date=7 March 2018}}</ref>

==Artistry==
===Music videos===
Her album, ''ISON'', is a visual album and has a video that is 1 hour, 6 minutes, and 28 seconds long. Unlike similar visual albums, the film is abstract and meant to be viewed in one sitting, as it subtly changes like a "moving painting".<ref name="wmagazine"/> Her general goal with her music videos is to "make it vulnerable and more than human at the same time."<ref name="papermag"/>

===="Human"====
Sevdaliza appears to be a satyr and an erotic dancer performing in a semi-abandoned large building with classical detailing in front of an audience sitting on a mezzanine. The audience consists of only men, who are clearly wealthy, being served food and receiving this seemingly private and exclusive performance. The time and place that this is occurring remains ambiguous, mostly because of the mysteriousness of Sevdaliza's semi-mythological character, who is  dancing on dirt that has been plowed as in preparation for an animal race. Additionally, her outfit recalls that of [[Debra Paget]] in the 1959 film ''[[The Indian Tomb (1959 film)|The Indian Tomb]]'', a nod to old Hollywood nostalgia and popular roles women play catering to male sexual desire.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://atwoodmagazine.com/human-sevdaliza/|title=Sevdaliza Hypnotizes Us With the Otherworldly "Human"|last=Wojick|first=Regan|date=15 December 2016|work=Atwood Magazine|access-date=7 March 2018}}</ref> The audience members sweat and watch cautiously, as if scared of her. Her video on YouTube is accompanied by the quote, 'the basic human need to be watched was once satisfied by god'. There is an official rendition of the song in Portuguese. The video for Human was directed by [[Emmanuel Adjei]].

===="Amandine Insensible"====
Sevdaliza performs several archetypal figures of women in contemporary society. These archetypes are all solo and set against a bright white background, with watermarks and are meant to represent the limited roles accessible to women. As a commentary on the commercialization of everyday life, Sevdaliza sold clips from the music video to [https://www.shutterstock.com/video/clip-23881564-stock-footage-professional-woman-call-center-operator-business.html?src=same_model/23881801:0/3p Shutterstock]. There is the "confident, powerful woman active wear", "professional woman operator call center business", "glamorous sensual woman in silk garment", "confidant ethnic woman leather suit umbrella", and "glamorous woman wow white fur piano". Sevdaliza says that "The accessibility of information and matter has created a new universal language, in which commercial brands play a key role."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefader.com/2017/02/14/sevdaliza-amandine-insensible-music-video-stock-photos|title="Watch Sevdaliza's "Amandine Insensible" Then Buy Her Stock Videos"|last=Darville|first=Jordan|date=14 February 2017|work=The Fader|access-date=1 March 2018}}</ref>

===Album art===
====''ISON''====
The album art for ''ISON'' features a hyper-realistic bust of Sevdaliza herself, barely superimposed and upside down over a mannequin copy that appears to be covered with fresh bright red paint. The hair that is hanging upside down, drapes over the shoulder of the bright red bust. Both appear to be sweaty or wet. The silicone sculpture is by sculptor Sarah Sitkin. Stikin says "The idea is based around Sevdaliza being the mother to herself and her past lives. It carries her vulnerability stoically. Her features distorted, some omitted, some emphasized. A new form is repeated through her 16 children (number of songs) surrounding her."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/xyjygq/premiere-see-the-hyperrealistic-mask-sevdaliza-commissioned-for-her-new-album-cover|title=See the Hyperrealistic Mask Sevdaliza Commissioned for Her New Album Cover|last=Ainley|first=Nathaniel|date=18 April 2017|work=Creators Vice|access-date=1 March 2018}}</ref>
