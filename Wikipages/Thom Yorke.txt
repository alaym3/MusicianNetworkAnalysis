'''Thomas Edward Yorke''' (born 7 October 1968) is an English musician and the main vocalist and songwriter of the rock band [[Radiohead]]. A multi-instrumentalist, he mainly plays guitar and keyboards and is known for his [[falsetto]]. He has been described by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' as one of the most influential singers of his generation.

Yorke formed Radiohead with schoolmates at [[Abingdon School]] in [[Oxfordshire]]. After he graduated from the [[University of Exeter]], Radiohead signed to [[Parlophone]]; their early hit "[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]" made Yorke a celebrity, and Radiohead have gone on to achieve critical acclaim and sales of over 30 million albums. Yorke's early influences included [[alternative rock]] acts such as the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]] and [[R.E.M.]]; Radiohead's fourth album, ''[[Kid A]]'' (2000), saw Yorke and the band move into [[electronic music]], influenced by [[Warp (record label)|Warp]] acts such as [[Aphex Twin]].

Yorke's solo work comprises mainly electronic music. His debut solo album, ''[[The Eraser]]'', was released in 2006. To perform it live, in 2009 he formed a new band, [[Atoms for Peace (band)|Atoms for Peace]], with musicians including [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] bassist [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] and Radiohead producer [[Nigel Godrich]]; they released an album, ''[[Amok (Atoms for Peace album)|Amok]]'', in 2013. Yorke's second solo album, ''[[Tomorrow's Modern Boxes]],'' was released in 2014, followed by ''[[Anima (Thom Yorke album)|Anima]]'' in 2019. In 2021, Yorke debuted a new band, the [[The Smile (band)|Smile]], with Radiohead guitarist [[Jonny Greenwood]] and drummer [[Sons of Kemet|Tom Skinner]]. 

Yorke has collaborated with artists including [[PJ Harvey]], [[Björk]], [[Flying Lotus]] and [[Modeselektor]], and has composed for film and theatre; his first feature film soundtrack, ''[[Suspiria (2018 soundtrack)|Suspiria]],'' was released in October 2018. With artist [[Stanley Donwood]], Yorke creates artwork for Radiohead albums and his other projects. He often incorporates "erratic" dancing into his performances.

Yorke is an activist on behalf of [[human rights]], [[animal rights]], [[Environmentalism|environmental]] and [[anti-war]] causes, and his lyrics incorporate political themes. He has been critical of the music industry, particularly of [[Record label|major labels]] and [[Streaming media|streaming]] services such as [[Spotify]]. With Radiohead and his solo work, he has pioneered alternative release platforms such as [[Pay what you want|pay-what-you-want]] and [[BitTorrent]]. Along with the other members of Radiohead, he was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2019.

==Early life==
Yorke was born on 7 October 1968 in [[Wellingborough|Wellingborough, Northamptonshire]]. He was born with a paralysed left eye, and underwent five eye operations by the age of six.<ref>Randall, p. 19</ref> According to Yorke, the last surgery was "botched", giving him a [[Ptosis (eyelid)|drooping eyelid]].<ref name="MCLEAN">{{cite news |first=Craig |last=McLean |title=All messed up |date=18 June 2006 |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,,1795948,00.html |work=The Observer |access-date=26 March 2007 |location=London |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723180139/http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,,1795948,00.html |archive-date=23 July 2008  }}</ref> He decided against further surgery: "I decided I liked the fact that it wasn’t the same, and I’ve liked it ever since.

Yorke attended the boys' public school [[Abingdon School|Abingdon]]. He felt out of place and found sanctuary in the music and art departments. Terence Gilmore-James, the Abingdon director of music, recalled Yorke as "forlorn and a little isolated" thanks to his unusual appearance, but talkative and opinionated. He said Yorke was "not a great musician", unlike his future bandmate [[Jonny Greenwood]], but a "thinker and experimenter".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/sep/13/celebrity.television|title=What were today's celebrities like as children?|date=13 September 2008|work=The Guardian|access-date=14 April 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Yorke later credited the support of Gilmore-James and the head of the art department for his success.<ref name=":28"/>

At Abingdon, Yorke met [[Ed O'Brien]], [[Philip Selway]] and brothers [[Colin Greenwood|Colin]] and Jonny Greenwood.<ref>Randall, p. 26–33</ref> The group formed a band, On a Friday, named after the only day they were allowed to practice.<ref name="MCLEAN" /> After leaving school, Yorke took a [[gap year]] and tried to become a professional musician.<ref name=":28"/> He held several jobs, including a period selling suits, and made a [[Demo (music)|demo tape]].<ref name=":28"/> He was also involved in a serious car accident that influenced the lyrics of later songs, including the [[The Bends (album)|''Bends'']] B-side "Killer Cars" (1995) and "Airbag" from ''[[OK Computer]]'' (1997).<ref>Randall, p. 38–39</ref>

On the strength of their first demo, On a Friday were offered a record deal by [[Island Records]], but the members decided they were not ready and wanted to go to university first.<ref name=":28"/> Yorke had wanted to apply to [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's]] to read English at the [[University of Oxford]], but, he said, "I was told I couldn't even apply – I was too thick.

On a Friday resumed activity in 1991 as most of the members were finishing their degrees. Ronan Munro, editor of the Oxford music magazine ''[[Curfew (magazine)|Curfew]]'', gave the band their first interview while they were sharing a house in Oxford. He recalled that "Thom wasn't like anyone I'd interviewed before ... He was like 'This is going to happen… failure is not an option' ... He wasn't some ranting diva or a megalomaniac, but he was so focused on what he wanted to do."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-33176717|title=Radiohead, Foals and 25 years of discovering Oxford music|work=BBC News|date=13 March 2016|language=en-GB|access-date=14 March 2016}}</ref>

==Career==
===Radiohead===
{{main|Radiohead}}
In 1991, when Yorke was 22,<ref name=":12" /> On a Friday signed to [[Parlophone]] and changed their name to Radiohead. According to Yorke, around this time he "hit the self-destruct button pretty quickly"; he cut his hair and drank heavily, often becoming too drunk to perform.<ref>Randall, p.87</ref> Radiohead gained notice with their debut single, "[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]", which appeared on their 1993 debut album, ''[[Pablo Honey]]''.<ref name="BILL2">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=radiohead|chart=all}}|title=Radiohead: Artist Chart History|work=Billboard|access-date=9 November 2007}}</ref> Yorke said that the success inflated his ego; he tried to project himself as a rock star, which included bleaching his hair and wearing extensions. He said: "When I got back to Oxford I was unbearable ... as soon as you get any success you disappear up your own arse."<ref>Randall, p. 120</ref> During a 1993 performance for [[MTV]], Yorke was almost electrocuted after he jumped into a swimming pool and reached for a live microphone; an employee on the shoot kicked it away from him.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gallagher|first=Simon|date=2014-04-27|title=13 Actors Who Almost Died Filming Major TV Shows|url=https://whatculture.com/tv/13-actors-who-almost-died-filming-major-tv-shows|access-date=2021-05-12|website=WhatCulture.com|language=en}}</ref>

Recording Radiohead's second album, ''[[The Bends (album)|The Bends]]'' (1995), was stressful, with the band pressured to release a follow-up to "Creep".<ref name=":44">{{Cite journal|last1=Irvin|first1=Jim|last2=Hoskyns|first2=Barney|date=July 1997|title=We Have Lift-Off!|journal=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]|issue=45}}</ref> Yorke in particular struggled with the pressure; according to the band's co-manager [[Chris Hufford]], "Thom became totally confused about what he wanted to do, what he was doing in a band and in his life, and that turned into a mistrust of everybody else."<ref name=":44" /> ''The Bends'' received critical acclaim. The American rock band [[R.E.M.]], a major influence on Radiohead, picked them as their support act for their European tour.<ref>Randall, p. 177</ref> Yorke befriended R.E.M. singer [[Michael Stipe]], who gave him advice about how to deal with fame.<ref>randall, p. 178</ref>

[[File:Thom Yorke 1998.jpg|thumb|Yorke in 1998]]During the production of Radiohead's third album, ''[[OK Computer]]'' (1997), the members had differing opinions and equal production roles, with Yorke having "the loudest voice", according to O'Brien.<ref>Randall, p. 195</ref> ''OK Computer ''achieved critical acclaim and strong sales, establishing Radiohead as one of the leading rock acts of the 1990s, but Yorke was ambivalent about success.<ref name="ZORIC2">{{cite news|last=Zoric|first=Lauren|title=I think I'm meant to be dead&nbsp;...| work=The Guardian| date=22 September 2000| url=https://www.theguardian.com/friday_review/story/0,,371289,00.html| access-date=18 May 2007}}</ref> Following the ''OK Computer'' tour, he suffered a [[mental breakdown]]<ref name="ZORIC2"/> and found it impossible to write new music.<ref name="ECCLESTON2">{{cite web |last=Eccleston |first=Danny |title=(Radiohead article) |work=Q Magazine |date=October 2000 |url=http://www.followmearound.com/presscuttings.php?year=2000&cutting=89&PHPSESSID=c033bc19e81ba698894f33e264541fc4 |access-date=18 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311024424/http://www.followmearound.com/presscuttings.php?year=2000&cutting=89&PHPSESSID=c033bc19e81ba698894f33e264541fc4 |archive-date=11 March 2007  }}</ref> In 2013, he said:

To recuperate, Yorke moved to [[Cornwall]] and spent time walking the cliffs, writing and drawing. He restricted his songwriting to piano; the first song he wrote was "[[Everything in Its Right Place]]".<ref name="Dazed">{{cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/15601/1/splitting-atoms-thom-yorke|title=Splitting atoms with Thom Yorke|website=Dazed|date=12 February 2013|access-date=11 April 2016}}</ref> During this period, Yorke listened almost exclusively to the [[electronic music]] of artists such as [[Aphex Twin]] and [[Autechre]], saying: "It was refreshing because the music was all structures and had no human voices in it. But I felt just as emotional about it as I'd ever felt about guitar music."<ref name="ZORIC2" /> Radiohead took these influences to their next albums ''[[Kid A]]'' (2000) and ''[[Amnesiac (album)|Amnesiac]]'' (2001), processing vocals, obscuring lyrics, and using electronic instruments such as synthesisers, drum machines and samplers. The albums divided fans and critics, but were commercially successful and later attracted wide acclaim; at the turn of the decade, ''Kid A'' was named the best album of the 2000s by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''.<ref name="rollingstone.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-best-albums-of-the-2000s-153375/|title=100 Best Albums of the 2000s|work=Rolling Stone|date=18 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/7710-the-top-200-albums-of-the-2000s-20-1/?page=2|title=The 200 Best Albums of the 2000s - Page 2|website=Pitchfork}}</ref>

In 2003, Radiohead released their sixth album, ''[[Hail to the Thief]]'', a blend of rock and electronic music. Yorke wrote many of its lyrics in response to the [[War on Terror]] and the resurgence of [[right-wing politics]] in the west after the turn of the millennium,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/bitter-prophet-thom-yorke-on-hail-to-the-thief-87869/|title=Bitter Prophet: Thom Yorke on ''Hail to the Thief''|last=Fricke|first=David|date=26 July 2006|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=24 August 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> and his shifting worldview after becoming a father.<ref name="spininterview">{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2003/06/fitter-happier-radiohead-return/|title=Fitter Happier: Radiohead Return|author=Chuck Klosterman|date=29 June 2003|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|access-date=18 February 2012}}</ref> In 2007, Radiohead independently released their seventh album, ''[[In Rainbows]]'', as a [[pay-what-you-want]] download, the first for a major act; the release made headlines worldwide and sparked debate about the implications for the music industry.<ref name="nytimespay2">{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/arts/music/09pare.html?ex=1354856400&en=ec2f1c29937292be&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all|title = Pay What You Want for This Article|access-date = 30 December 2007|author = Pareles, Jon|author-link = Jon Pareles|date = 9 December 2007|work = The New York Times}}</ref> In 2011, Radiohead self-released their eighth album, ''[[The King of Limbs]]'', which Yorke described as "an expression of physical movements and wildness".<ref name="outtake22">{{Cite episode|title='Everything In Its Right Place' interview outtake: "Another outtake from my @Radiohead interview on @npratc with Thom and Ed.

Yorke has worked with producer [[Nigel Godrich]] on every Radiohead album since ''[[The Bends (album)|The Bends]]'' (1995), as well as most of his solo work.

Yorke often manipulates his voice with software and [[Effects unit|effects]], transforming it into a "disembodied instrument".<ref name="rollingstone" /> For example, on "[[Everything in Its Right Place]]", his vocals were treated to create a "glitching, stuttering collage".<ref name=":022">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/mar/09/whats-that-sound-kaoss-pad|title=Hey, what's that sound: Kaoss Pad|last=McNamee|first=David|date=9 March 2011|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|access-date=22 August 2018}}</ref> ''Pitchfork'' wrote in 2016 that, over the decades, Yorke's voice had evolved from "semi-interesting alt-rocker" to "left-field art-rock demigod" to "electronic grand wizard".<ref name=":25" /> In 2006, Yorke said: "It annoys me how pretty my voice is. That sounds incredibly immodest, but it annoys me how polite it can sound when perhaps what I'm singing is deeply acidic."<ref name="New York Times" /> He said he keeps vocals in mind whenever he builds music, no matter the genre: "It's almost impossible for me to listen to a dance tune from beginning to end without picturing a voice."<ref name=":6" />

In 2005, readers of ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' and [[MTV2]] voted Yorke the 18th greatest singer of all time. In 2008, ''Rolling Stone'' ranked him the 66th and wrote that he was one of the most influential singers of his generation, influencing bands including [[Muse (band)|Muse]], [[Coldplay]], [[Travis (band)|Travis]] and [[Elbow (band)|Elbow]].<ref name="rollingstone" />

Tortured often seems the only way to do things early on, but that in itself becomes tired. By the time we were doing ''Kid A'' I didn't feel I was writing about myself at all.

== Politics and activism ==
=== Music industry ===
Yorke has been critical of the [[music industry]] and has pioneered alternative release platforms with Radiohead and his solo work. Following Radiohead's 1993 ''Pablo Honey'' tour of America, he became disenchanted with being "right at the sharp end of the sexy, sassy, [[MTV]] eye-candy lifestyle" he felt he was helping sell.<ref name="REYNOLDS">{{Citation

=== Climate change ===
In 2000, during the recording of ''Kid A'', Yorke became "obsessed" with the [[Worldwatch Institute]] website, "which was full of scary statistics about icecaps melting and weather patterns changing".<ref name="optimist">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2008/mar/20/thomyorke|title=Thom Yorke: why I'm a climate optimist|last=Yorke|first=Thom|date=23 March 2008|publisher=Guardian|access-date=26 April 2015}}</ref> He said he became involved in the [[Climate movement|movement to halt climate change]] after having children and "waking up every night just terrified".<ref name=":4">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/earthnews/8885069/Thom-Yorke-on-board-the-Rainbow-Warrior-3.html|title=Thom Yorke on board the Rainbow Warrior 3|access-date=27 April 2015}}</ref>

Yorke has been a supporter of [[Friends of the Earth]] and their [[Big Ask Campaign]] since 2003. He and Jonny Greenwood headlined the Big Ask Live, a 2006 benefit concert to persuade the government to enact a new law on climate change.<ref name=":3">{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,,1795948,00.html|title=All Messed Up|author=Mclean, Craig|date=18 June 2006|newspaper=[[The Observer|Observer Music Monthly]]|access-date=18 June 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723180139/http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,,1795948,00.html|archive-date=23 July 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> In a ''Guardian'' article, Yorke wrote:{{cquote|At first I told Friends of the Earth that I was absolutely the wrong person to be associated with their campaign.

In 2006, Yorke refused an invitation from Friends of the Earth to meet prime minister [[Tony Blair]] to discuss climate change. Yorke wrote on Radiohead's site that "I have no intention of being used by spider spin doctors to make it look like we make progress when it is just words", and told the ''NME'' that Blair had "no environmental credentials as far as I'm concerned".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/mar/22/greenpolitics.politicsandthearts|title=Radiohead singer snubs Blair climate talks|last=Adam|first=David|date=22 March 2006|access-date=17 July 2008|work=The Guardian|location=London}}</ref> He told the ''Guardian'' that Blair's advisers had "wanted pre-meetings. They wanted to know that I was on-side. Also, I was being manoeuvred into a position where if I said the wrong thing post-the meeting, Friends of the Earth would lose their access. Which normally would be called blackmail."<ref name=":3" />

In 2008, Radiohead commissioned a study to reduce the carbon expended on tour; based on the study, they chose to play at venues supported by public transport, made deals with trucking companies to reduce emissions, used new low-energy [[LED]] lighting and encouraged festivals to offer reusable plastics.<ref name="optimist" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/06/radiohead-daydream-festival-led-lighting.php|title=Radiohead Pushes Festivals Like Daydream to Go Green|last=Scholtus|first=Petz|date=18 June 2008|access-date=21 February 2009|publisher=Treehugger}}</ref> In the same year, Yorke guest-edited a special climate change edition of ''[[The Observer|Observer Magazine]]'' and wrote: "Unlike pessimists such as [[James Lovelock]], I don't believe we are all doomed&nbsp;...
