His maternal grandfather, Albert Jones, was Welsh, and his maternal grandmother, Ada Jones, was born in Pontypridd, to parents from [[Somerset]] and Wiltshire.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/5490511/Sir-Tom-Jones-is-English.html |title=Sir Tom Jones 'is English' |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=10 June 2009|location=London |issn=0307-1235 |oclc=49632006 |access-date=4 May 2013}}</ref>

Jones did not like school or sports, but gained confidence through his singing talent.<ref name="DIDiscs TJ">{{cite episode |title=Desert Island Discs with Tom Jones |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00tx499 |series=Desert Island Discs | series-link=Desert Island Discs |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] |airdate=26 September 2010}}</ref> At 12 he was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]]. Many years later he said: "I spent two years in bed recovering. It was the worst time of my life." During convalescence, he could do little else but listen to music and draw.<ref name="closeup" />{{rp|9–10}}

Jones's bluesy singing style developed out of the sound of American [[soul music]]. His early influences included [[blues]], [[R&B]] and [[rock and roll]] singers [[Little Richard]], [[Solomon Burke]], [[Jackie Wilson]], [[Brook Benton]], [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]].<ref name="rollingstone2015">Appleford, Steve [https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/tom-jones-on-meeting-elvis-recording-with-bacharach-panty-magnet-phase-20151215 "Tom Jones on Meeting Elvis, Recording With Bacharach, 'Panty Magnet' Phase"]. ''Rolling Stone''. 17 December 2015. Retrieved 17 December 2015.</ref>

In March 1957, Jones married his high school girlfriend Linda Trenchard, when they were expecting a child together, both aged 16. The couple's son, Mark, was born in the month following their wedding. To support his young family, Jones took a job working in a glove factory and was later employed in construction.

==Career==
===Rise to fame===
Jones's voice has been described as a "full-throated, robust [[baritone]]".<ref name="allmusic"/> According to Jones himself, his young voice was a [[tenor]] voice. He said: "What you lose on the top end, you gain on the bottom end. I used to be able to hit a top C when I was young now it's a B flat."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/entertainment-arts-18158211|title=Tom Jones on his changing voice|work=BBC News}}</ref> He became the frontman in 1963 for Tommy Scott and the Senators, a Welsh [[beat group]]. They soon gained a local following and reputation in [[South Wales]]. In 1964, the group recorded several solo tracks with producer [[Joe Meek]], who took them to various record labels, but they had little success. Later that year, [[Decca Records|Decca]] producer Peter Sullivan saw Tommy Scott and the Senators performing in a club and directed them to manager [[Phil Solomon (music executive)|Phil Solomon]], but the partnership was short-lived.

The group continued to play gigs at dance halls and [[working men's club]]s in South Wales. One night at the Top Hat in [[Cwmtillery]], Jones was spotted by [[Gordon Mills]], a London-based manager who also originally hailed from [[South Wales]]. Mills became Jones's manager, took the young singer to London, and also renamed him "Tom Jones",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/tom-jones/pages/biography_02.shtml |title=Music – Tom Jones – Tom Jones biography – part two |website=BBC Wales |access-date=12 October 2015}}</ref> to exploit the popularity of the Academy Award-winning [[Tom Jones (1963 film)|1963 film]].<ref>{{cite magazine| magazine= [[Life (magazine)|Life]] |title= They can always go home to MAM| date= 18 September 1970 | page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=8lUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA54 54]| volume= 69| number= 12 |quote= Mills promptly changed the singer's name to Tom Jones, to exploit the popularity of the current film by that name, and for six months he and Tom and the accompanists lived off a loan Mills talked a bank into giving them.}}</ref>

Eventually, Mills got Jones a recording contract with [[Decca Records|Decca]]. His first single, "Chills and Fever", was released in late 1964. It did not chart, but the follow-up, "[[It's Not Unusual]]", became an international [[chart-topper|hit]] after offshore [[pirate radio]] station [[Radio Caroline]] promoted it. The following year was the most prominent of Jones's career, making him one of the most popular vocalists of the [[British Invasion]]. In early 1965, "It's Not Unusual" reached No. 1 in the United Kingdom and the top ten in the United States. During 1965, Mills secured a number of film themes for Jones to record, including the theme songs for the film ''[[What's New Pussycat?]]'' (written by [[Burt Bacharach]] and [[Hal David]]) and also for the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]''.<ref name="BioPart3"/> Jones was also awarded the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist]] in 1966.<ref name="Grammy">{{cite magazine| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5SgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA13 |title=Naras Champions of 1965| page= 12| magazine= Billboard | date= 26 March 1966| access-date= 8 April 2012}}</ref> During a filming break at Paramount Studios (1965) in Hollywood, Jones met [[Elvis Presley]] for the first time;<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kelly|first=Helen|date=30 January 2021|title=Sir Tom Jones spills on 'unbelievable' first meeting with Elvis Presley|url=https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/1391167/Sir-Tom-Jones-first-meeting-Elvis-Presley-The-Voice-BBC-video|access-date=30 January 2021|website=Daily Express|language=en}}</ref> he recalls Presley singing, 'With These Hands' as he walked towards him from the film set.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.express.co.uk/celebrity-news/1390614/Tom-Jones-Twitter-songs-single-new-music-The-Voice-UK-latest-news-update |title=Tom Jones: The Voice UK coach apologises to American fans 'Sorry it’s taken a while' |work=Daily Express |last=Tonks |first=Andrea |date=29 January 2021 |access-date=20 August 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref> The two men became good friends.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-50547933|title=Elvis: Sir Tom Jones was the one artist he 'truly called a friend'|work=BBC News|date=30 November 2019}}</ref>

In 1966, Jones's popularity began to slip somewhat, causing Mills to reshape the singer's image into that of a [[crooner]]. Jones also began to sing material that appealed to a wider audience, such as the country hit "[[Green, Green Grass of Home]]". The strategy worked, and Jones returned to the top of the charts in the UK and began hitting the Top 40 again in the US. For the remainder of the decade, he scored a string of hits on both sides of the Atlantic, including "[[I'll Never Fall in Love Again (Lonnie Donegan song)|I'll Never Fall in Love Again]]", "I'm Coming Home", and "Delilah", each of which reached No. 2 in the UK chart.<ref name="Tom Jones Nostalgia Central">{{cite web| url= http://www.nostalgiacentral.com/music/tomjones.htm | title= Tom Jones| website= nostalgiacentral.com |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060721100011/http://www.nostalgiacentral.com/music/tomjones.htm |archive-date= 21 July 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.classicbands.com/tomjones.html |title=Tom Jones |website=Classicbands.com |access-date=12 October 2015}}</ref>

===1967 to 1987===
In 1967, Jones performed in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] for the first time, at the [[Flamingo Las Vegas|Flamingo]].<ref name="BioPart3">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/tom-jones/pages/biography_03.shtml |title=Music – Tom Jones – Tom Jones biography – part three |website=BBC Wales |access-date=12 October 2015}}</ref> His performances and style of dress became part of his stage act, and increasingly featured his open, half-unbuttoned shirts and tight trousers. He soon chose to record less, instead concentrating on his lucrative club performances. Jones played in Las Vegas at least one week each year until 2011.

Jones had an internationally successful television variety show titled ''[[This Is Tom Jones]]'' from 1969 to 1971.  The [[Associated Television]]-produced show was worth a reported {{US$|9000000|1971|about=yes|round=-5}} to Jones over three years.  It was broadcast by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in the UK and by the [[American Broadcasting Company]] in the US.  As a result of the show, Jones was nominated in 1970 for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy|a "best actor" Golden Globe]].<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/tom-jones/pages/this-is-tom-jones-dvd.shtml |publisher= BBC| place= Wales| title= ''This Is Tom Jones'' DVD review| access-date= 5 January 2013}}</ref> From 1980 to 1981, he had a second television variety show, ''[[Tom Jones (TV series)|Tom Jones]]'', which was produced in [[Vancouver]], Canada, and lasted 24 episodes.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Both television shows were the subject of litigation with the original licence holder [[C/F International]].  {{As of|2004|12}}, C/F International was a secured judgment creditor of [[Classic World Productions]] and its principal, Darryl Payne, for approximately {{US$|1000000|2004|about=yes|round=-5}}, and was the principal secured creditor at the time of the subsequent bankruptcy filing by the company.

C/F International's rights to later Tom Jones material were also disputed.  In March 2007, Tom Jones and Tom Jones Enterprises sued C/F International to stop the company from licensing sound recordings made from the 1981 ''Tom Jones'' series.  It was contended that any rights that C/F International had to license the ''Tom Jones'' show did not include the right to make and license separate recordings of the performances on the show, and that any rights that C/F International had in the ''Tom Jones'' show no longer existed because of numerous breaches of contract.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?storyCode=26492&sectioncode=1 |title=Tom Jones seeks injunction over recordings |magazine=Music Week |date=2 March 2007 |access-date=12 October 2015}}</ref> Examples of contentious CDs are ''Live on the Tom Jones Show'', released in 2006, and ''Greatest Hits Live'', originally issued by C/F International in 1981 and later licensed to and issued by Prism Leisure Corporation as ''30 Greatest Hits – Live in Concert''.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.7digital.com/artists/various-artists/live-on-the-tom-jones-show/ |title= Live on The Tom Jones Show| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080124062521/http://www.7digital.com/artists/various-artists/live-on-the-tom-jones-show/ |archive-date=24 January 2008 | website= 7digital.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.discogs.com/Tom-Jones-30-Greatest-Hits-Live-In-Concert/release/10485850| publisher= Discogs| title= 30 Greatest Hits – Live in Concert| access-date= 29 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000URRAYC |title=Tom Jones – 30 Greatest Hits/Live in Concert | publisher= Amazon.com |access-date=12 October 2015}}</ref>

On 26 April 1970, [[CBS]] released the [[Raquel Welch]] television special ''[[Raquel!

In the 1970s, Jones toured with the female singing groups [[Quiet Elegance]] and [[the Blossoms]] as his backing groups. He had a number of hit singles, including "[[She's a Lady]]", "[[Till (song)|Till]]", and "[[The Young New Mexican Puppeteer]]", but in the mid-1970s his popularity declined. He did, however, have a big hit in 1976 with "[[Say You'll Stay Until Tomorrow]]", which went to No. 1 on the US country chart, No. 15 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and No. 40 on the UK Singles Chart.

In 1972, he co-starred with [[Jennifer O'Neill]] in David Winters's television special ''[[The Special London Bridge Special]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|date=6 May 1972|title=Lake Havasu city plays a starring role in special|page=12-D|work=Colorado Springs Gazette-Telegraph}}</ref>

In 1976, Jones was set to make his film debut in the film ''Yockowald'', in which he was to play a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] assassin. The film was shelved after the production ran out of money three weeks into filming.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/arts-culture-news/7-things-you-definitely-never-8824732|title=7 things you DEFINITELY never knew about Sir Tom Jones |first= Nathan |last= Bevan |date=12 March 2015 |website= Walesonline.co.uk|access-date=11 November 2018}}</ref>

In 1979, Jones made his acting debut in ''[[Pleasure Cove]]'', an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television film which was a pilot for a potential television series but was not picked up.

In the early 1980s, Jones started to record country music.

The following year, he covered [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s "[[Kiss (Tom Jones song)|Kiss]]" with [[Art of Noise]]. The song reached No. 5 in the UK and No. 31 in the US.

===1990s resurgence===

Jones received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 1989, located at 6608 [[Hollywood Boulevard]], Los Angeles, California, in front of [[Frederick's of Hollywood]]. He collaborated with [[Van Morrison]] on his album ''Carrying A Torch'', released in 1991 on [[Dover Records]], featuring Jones's cover of [[Carrying a Torch|Morrison's title track]].

In 1992, he made his first appearance at the UK's [[Glastonbury Festival]], and in 1993 he appeared as himself in episodes of two popular US sitcoms, ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'' ("[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (season 3)|The {{sic|Alma Matter|hide=y|expected=Alma Mater}}]]") and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' ("[[Marge Gets a Job]]").

Jones has stated that he had sex with up to 250 groupies a year at the height of his fame.<ref name= czone /> His [[philandering]] once led Linda to assault him.

One affair resulted in the birth of a son. In October 1987, while on tour in the US, Jones had a brief relationship with model Katherine Berkery, who then discovered she was pregnant. After a legal battle that included [[DNA]] [[paternity test|testing]], a United States court ruled in 1989 that Jones was the boy's father. Jones denied the court's findings, until finally, in 2008, he admitted they were true. He has shown no interest in meeting his son, Jonathan Berkery.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2008/12/14/tom-jones-admits-he-is-father-of-us-singer-91466-22470948|title=Tom Jones admits he is father of US singer|work=Wales Online|access-date=12 October 2015}}</ref>

Following the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|election of a Labour government in 1974]], Jones became a [[tax exile]] to avoid a 98 per cent income tax.<ref name="closeup"/> In June 1976, he purchased the red-brick mansion at [[363 Copa De Oro Road]] in the [[East Gate Bel Air, Los Angeles|East Gate Old Bel Air in Los Angeles]] from [[Dean Martin]] for $500,000.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/welsh-homes/8000-semi-6m-bel-air-8631385|title=From the £8,000 semi to $6m Bel Air mansion, inside the houses Sir Tom Jones has called home|work=Wales Online|date=12 February 2015|access-date=11 November 2015}}</ref> He sold it to [[Nicolas Cage]] in 1998 for a reported $6.469&nbsp;million. In 2009, after 35 years in the US, Jones said that he and his wife were planning to move back to the UK. "I've had a great time living in Los Angeles", Jones said, "but after all these years, we think now is the time to move home".<ref name="Tom Jones Bio"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/a163139/tom-jones-moving-back-to-britain.html|title=Tom Jones 'moving back to Britain'|work=Digital Spy|date=2 July 2009|access-date=17 October 2009}}</ref>

In October 2015 his autobiography, ''Over the Top and Back: The Autobiography'', was published by [[Michael Joseph (publisher)|Michael Joseph]].<ref>{{cite book|date=8 October 2015| first= Tom |last= Jones|isbn=978-0-7181-8068-3|title=Over the Top and Back: The Autobiography| publisher= Michael Joseph}}</ref> Reviewing the book in the ''[[Daily Express]]'', Clair Woodward said, "In the tradition of so many autobiographies these days, Tom Jones's doesn't tell you what you really want to hear. ... What you are left with is a riotously enjoyable story of Jones 'The Voice' which nicely doubles as the story of British pop and light entertainment from the Sixties onwards."<ref>{{cite news|last=Woodward |first=Clair |url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/books/609200/Over-The-Top-And-Back-The-Autobiography-Sir-Tom-Jones-Leading-Dictator-book-review |title=Book reviews: Over The Top And Back: The Autobiography |work=Daily Express|date=2 October 2015|access-date=7 November 2015}}</ref>

A few years after Linda's death there had been rumours that Jones was dating [[Priscilla Presley]]. In 2021 he openly commented that the two had known each other since the 1960s. The fact that they had been dining out together and were seen together at [[Jeff Franklin]]'s house had led some people to believe they might be dating, but their relationship did not include any romantic aspect; they just enjoyed spending time together.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://people.com/music/tom-jones-elvis-presley-friendship-priscilla-presley-dating-rumors/|title=Tom Jones Talks His 'Close' Friendship with the Late Elvis Presley, Addresses Priscilla Presley Dating Rumors|access-date=11 July 2021 |language=German}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.krone.at/2404862 |title=Etwa ein Paar?

Jones and his idol [[Elvis Presley]] had met in 1965 at the [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] film stage, when Elvis was filming ''[[Paradise, Hawaiian Style]]''.<ref name="rollingstone2015" /><ref name="BioPart3" /> They became good friends, spending more and more time together in Las Vegas and duetting until the early hours at Presley's private suite. The friendship endured until Presley's death in 1977.<ref name="BioPart3" /> Jones's guitarist between 1969 and 1974 was [[Big Jim Sullivan]], who also met and formed a friendship with Presley.

==Cultural influence==
[[Space (English band)|Space]] and [[Cerys Matthews]] released "[[The Ballad of Tom Jones]]", a song about a fighting couple who are calmed down by listening to Jones's music on the radio. The song reached No. 4 in the UK in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spacetheband.com/discography/singles/the-ballad-of-tom-jones|title=The Ballad of Tom Jones the Single by Space – Discography|publisher=Space the Band|access-date=12 October 2015}}</ref>

<blockquote>...the show itself, written by Mike James and directed by Geinor Styles, is a more humdrum—while hummable—affair than its star and subject deserves.

In the video game ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'', one of the playable characters, the Scout, is a collector of Tom Jones merchandise, and Tom Jones is depicted being murdered by another playable character, the Soldier in the tie-in comics. The Spy later convinces the Scout that Tom Jones is his father when using his shape-shifting ability when he suffers a near-death experience.
