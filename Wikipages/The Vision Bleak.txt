'''The Vision Bleak''' is a German [[gothic metal]] duo comprising Ulf Theodor Schwadorf (famous for his work with [[Empyrium]] and [[Noekk]]) and Allen B. Konstanz. The group's lyrics are noted for their [[Horror fiction|horror]] themes and heavily allude to works of classic writers/filmmakers of the genre, such as [[H. P. Lovecraft]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[George A. Romero]] and [[John Carpenter]], among others. They self-describe their musical style, which mixes gothic metal, [[doom metal]], [[symphonic metal]] and [[horror punk]] aesthetics, as "horror metal".

==History==
The Vision Bleak was formed in 2000, in the [[Bavaria]]n city of [[Mellrichstadt]], by Markus Stock (a.k.a. Ulf Theodor Schwadorf) and Tobias Schönemann (a.k.a. Allen B. Konstanz). Their first release was the independent extended play ''[[Songs of Good Taste]]'', which came out in 2001 and contained, among other tracks, a cover of [[The Moody Blues]]' "[[Nights in White Satin]]". The EP caught the attention of [[Prophecy Productions]], who approached them to record their first full-length, ''[[The Deathship Has a New Captain]]'', on 23 February 2004; counting with a guest appearance by [[Dark Sanctuary]] vocalist Dame Pandora, it would be their first of many releases under the Prophecy label. A [[The Vision Bleak (EP)|teaser EP]] containing two tracks which would eventually appear on the album was released the year prior.

In 2005 the band released "Carpathia", a promotional single for their then-upcoming second full-length, ''[[Carpathia: A Dramatic Poem]]'', which came out on 29 August 2005.

On 31 August 2007, the band released their third studio album, ''[[The Wolves Go Hunt Their Prey]]'' – it is a loose [[concept album]] whose first part is based on the story of the Indian [[Feral child|feral girls]] [[Amala and Kamala]], and its second part is mostly composed of the "Black Pharaoh Trilogy", a series of three songs based on [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s short story "[[The Haunter of the Dark]]". A [[Promotional recording|promo EP]] which served as a teaser for the album, ''[[Club Single]]'', was released the month prior.

The band's fourth album, ''[[Set Sail to Mystery]]'', came out on 2 April 2010;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.the-vision-bleak.de/|title=News from the studio|date=5 August 2009}}</ref> it would be their first album (and so far only) to not feature a teaser released before it. It is a concept album loosely based on the writings of [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poets such as [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Heinrich Heine]] and [[Lord Byron]] (its opening track, "A Curse of the Grandest Kind", takes its lyrics from an excerpt of Byron's 1817 dramatic poem ''[[Manfred]]'', while "Descend into Maelstrom" references in its lyrics and title Poe's short story "[[A Descent into the Maelström]]"), and also of [[H. P. Lovecraft]] and [[Clark Ashton Smith]]. [[Niklas Kvarforth]] of [[Shining (Swedish band)|Shining]] was a guest musician on the album.

The band's fifth album, ''[[Witching Hour (The Vision Bleak album)|Witching Hour]]'', came out on 27 September 2013. A [[stop motion]] [[music video]] for the track "The Wood Hag", directed and animated by [[Fursy Teyssier]], was uploaded on Prophecy's official [[YouTube]] channel as a teaser on 4 September.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDmmMbHWr0I The Vision Bleak - "The Wood Hag"]</ref>

On 31 October 2015, The Vision Bleak announced that they would begin a tour around Europe, accompanied by [[John Haughm]] of [[Agalloch]] and [[Denmark|Danish]] [[death-doom]] band [[Saturnus (band)|Saturnus]], to promote their sixth album, ''[[The Unknown (The Vision Bleak album)|The Unknown]]'', which was released on 3 June 2016.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/thevisionbleak.official/photos/a.389987432091.171998.268327887091/10153641562577092/?type=3 The Vision Bleak – Facebook (31 October 2015)]</ref><ref>[http://en.prophecy.de/the-vision-bleak-the-unknown.html PROPHECY.DE | The Vision Bleak - The Unknown]</ref> The "Into the Unknown Tour" lasted from 25 March to 20 August 2016. A four-track EP that served as a teaser to ''The Unknown'', entitled ''[[The Kindred of the Sunset]]'', was announced on 21 February 2016<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/thevisionbleak.official/photos/a.389987432091.171998.268327887091/10153873172757092/?type=3&permPage=1 The Vision Bleak – Facebook (21 February 2016)]</ref> and eventually released on 25 March. As a means to celebrate their 16th anniversary, and to introduce newcomers to their music, the band also released a [[compilation album]] entitled ''[[Timeline (The Vision Bleak album)|Timeline: An Introduction to The Vision Bleak]]'' as a companion to ''The Unknown''.<ref>[http://en.prophecy.de/the-vision-bleak/the-vision-bleak-timeline-an-introduction-to-the-vision-bleak.html PROPHECY.DE | The Vision Bleak - Timeline - An Introduction To The Vision Bleak]</ref>

On 27 December 2015, the band stated that Fursy Teyssier officially joined them as bassist for future live performances.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/thevisionbleak.official/photos/a.389987432091.171998.268327887091/10153752244197092/?type=3 The Vision Bleak – Facebook (27 December 2015)]</ref> Teyssier stayed with the band until 2017.
