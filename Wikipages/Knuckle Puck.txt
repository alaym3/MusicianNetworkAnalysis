'''Knuckle Puck''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band, formed in 2010 in the southwest suburbs of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. The group started out covering songs, before the band members started writing songs in April 2011. Following this, the group released a number of EPs, one of which, ''[[While I Stay Secluded]]'' (2014), peaked at number 5 on the [[Heatseekers Albums]] chart. The band released a split EP with the UK band [[Neck Deep]]. The group signed to [[Rise Records|Rise]] in December 2014 and released its debut album, ''[[Copacetic (Knuckle Puck album)|Copacetic]]'', through the label in July 2015.

The "knucklepuck" shot (ice hockey) was popularized by the 1994 film [[D2: The Mighty Ducks]].
