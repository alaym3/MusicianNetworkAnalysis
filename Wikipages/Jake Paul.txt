On May 11, he released another single titled ''My Teachers'', featuring now-former Team 10 members Sunny Malouf and Anthony Trujillo, along with the music video.

The latter song features Anthony and the duo as well; the music video was released later on September 12.

On August 15, 2018, Paul released another single titled "Champion," with a music video. The song was a [[diss track]] towards Paul's boxing opponent Deji Olatunji (ComedyShortsGamer), the younger brother of British YouTube star, internet personality, boxer, and rapper [[KSI (entertainer)|KSI]], in which their fight happened ten days later on August 25. Throughout the summer of 2018, Paul and Team 10 went on a tour within the United States, performing songs. Gradually, the Team 10 members all left one by one from the beginning of the year until the end.

===2019: Business enterprises and new group===
On March 1, 2019, Paul released the single "I'm Single", which was released along with the music video. The song focused on Paul's feelings about being single and his breakup with Erika Costell.

On September 10, Paul released another single titled "23", alongside a music video at his house, which only starred his older brother [[Logan Paul|Logan]] and also featured clips of him and a few of his friends. The title of the song refers to his age at the time, as well as American former basketball player [[Michael Jordan]]'s jersey number. On October 15, Paul released the single "Dummy", featuring Canadian rapper TVGucci, who is signed to fellow Canadian rapper [[Drake (musician)|Drake]]'s record label, [[OVO Sound]].

==Controversies and legal issues==

=== Content controversies ===
On January 3, 2018, Paul uploaded a video to his YouTube channel titled "I lost my virginity" which used a [[thumbnail]] of himself and his then-girlfriend [[Erika Costell]] posing semi-nude on top of each other. The video was age-restricted by YouTube as a result, and critics such as [[Keemstar]] criticized the thumbnail as being [[Age appropriateness|inappropriate for his younger audience]]. The thumbnail was later changed with both Paul and Costell fully clothed and not touching each other.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Alexander |first=Julia |date=January 5, 2018 |title=Logan Paul's brother Jake draws more negative attention to YouTube creators |url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/5/16853894/jake-paul-logan-paul-thumbnail-rap |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106173234/https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/5/16853894/jake-paul-logan-paul-thumbnail-rap |archive-date=January 6, 2018 |access-date=January 5, 2018 |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref> Two days later, on January 5, [[TMZ]] revealed a video in which Paul used the racial epithet "[[nigga]]" multiple times while [[freestyle rap]]ping.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lockett |first=Dee |date=January 5, 2018 |title=Not to Be Outdone by His Brother, Jake Paul Caught Dropping N-Word in Leaked Video |url=http://www.vulture.com/2018/01/jake-paul-caught-rapping-n-word-twice-in-leaked-video.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106120347/http://www.vulture.com/2018/01/jake-paul-caught-rapping-n-word-twice-in-leaked-video.html |archive-date=January 6, 2018 |access-date=January 5, 2018 |publisher=[[New York (magazine)#Digital expansion and blogs|Vulture.com]]}}</ref>

On November 29, 2020, Paul sparked frustration after stating he paved the way for content house creation and boxing matches between high-profile social media stars. Many objected to Paul's claim, observing that he did not create the first content house, nor was he the first YouTube star to fight in a boxing match.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jake Paul causes 'second hand embarrassment' for claiming he made first YouTube content house |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/jake-paul-youtube-content-house-logan-paul-ksi-boxing-match-b1723545.html |access-date=November 29, 2020 |website=Independent|date=November 29, 2020 }}</ref>

=== Scam allegations ===
On January 3, 2018, Paul started the website Edfluence, a program claiming to teach younger people how to be successful, learn life skills, and earn money online. The course cost [[United States dollar|US$]]7 per user, which would allow the user to unlock a series of videos for a "roadmap" to success as an influencer. However, the seven dollars did not unlock the entire program, but only gave a few basic tips. Paul also promised his audience that if they joined the course, they would get to join "Team 1000", which did not happen. Following the situation, Paul was accused of scamming young followers and stealing their money. Then, two years later, on January 31, 2020, Edfluence was shut down, which stopped the course permanently.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Farokhmanesh |first=Megan |date=January 23, 2018 |title=Jake Paul's school for social media stars will teach you all the wrong lessons |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/23/16874750/jake-paul-edfluence-social-media |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123184513/https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/23/16874750/jake-paul-edfluence-social-media |archive-date=January 23, 2018 |access-date=January 23, 2018 |website=[[The Verge]]}}</ref> On February 15, Paul announced that he would partner with Los Angeles-based brand development group GenZ Holdings Inc. to create a $19.99 per month platform aimed at teaching children how to build an online presence.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cleo Yap |first=Audrey |date=February 16, 2020 |title=YouTuber Jake Paul Launches Entrepreneur How-To Platform, Financial Freedom Movement |url=https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/youtube-jake-paul-launches-financial-freedom-movement-1203505286/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200603053017/https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/youtube-jake-paul-launches-financial-freedom-movement-1203505286/ |archive-date=June 3, 2020 |access-date=July 16, 2020 |website=Variety |language=en}}</ref> "The Financial Freedom Movement" promises to give subscribers access to "Jake Paul’s personal experience, rituals and secret formula" and "cutting edge mentorship, coaching, and training".<ref name="FFMTubeFilter">{{Cite web |last=Hale |first=James |title=Jake Paul Launches 'The Financial Freedom Movement,' A $19.99/Month Program For Kids To Become Influencers |url=https://www.tubefilter.com/2020/02/17/jake-paul-financial-freedom-movement-edfluence-program-kids-influencers/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200307121735/https://www.tubefilter.com/2020/02/17/jake-paul-financial-freedom-movement-edfluence-program-kids-influencers/ |archive-date=March 7, 2020 |access-date=July 16, 2020 |website=Tube Filter|date=February 17, 2020 }}</ref> The program has been criticized by some, with one interviewer questioning whether it would send a dangerous message to his young fanbase.<ref name="FFMTubeFilter" />

On January 3, 2019, Paul, along with fellow YouTuber [[RiceGum]], came under fire for promoting ''MysteryBrand'', a website that offers the chance to open a digital "mystery box" of pre-selected items with a promise to win one in real life at random. Many users have said they have not received prizes they won through the site.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Shamsian |first=Jacob |date=January 3, 2019 |title=Jake Paul and other influencers are promoting 'mystery boxes' to their young audiences.

===Party complaints, public nuisance lawsuits, and COVID-19===

On February 23, 2020, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Paul was involved in an altercation with British singer [[Zayn Malik]] at [[Westgate Las Vegas|Westgate]], the hotel near the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] at which the two were staying. Paul and Malik's rooms were right across from each other and when Paul's older brother, [[Logan Paul|Logan]], went to Paul's hotel room, an argument broke out between Malik and Paul because Paul believed Malik was using a rude tone. Following the interaction, Paul posted about it on Twitter, which drew attention from Malik's girlfriend and American model [[Gigi Hadid]]. Paul later deleted his tweets which criticized Malik and then posted another tweet stating that he tweeted about the incident since he was [[alcohol intoxication|drunk]], acknowledging the fact in a tweet later in the day, writing, "someone needs to take my phone when i'm drunk because I am a fucking idiot".<ref>{{Cite web |date=February 24, 2020 |title=Jake Paul Deletes Shady Zayn Malik Tweets And Apologises After Gigi Hadid Hit Back At YouTuber |url=https://www.capitalfm.com/artists/zayn/jake-paul-gigi-hadid-twitter-girlfriend-feud/#:~:text=Jake%20Paul%20has%20deleted%20his,to%20the%20One%20Direction%20singer. |access-date=February 24, 2020 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref> Logan released the video footage on the 161st episode of his podcast, ''[[Logan Paul|Impaulsive]]'', in which he explained the whole situation.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gigi Hadid and Pewdiepie Roast Jake Paul – IMPAULSIVE EP. 161 – YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKhrGfeoWxI |access-date=December 26, 2020 |website=Youtube.com}}</ref>

On July 11, 2020, Paul threw a large party at his home in [[Calabasas, California]], despite the ongoing [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. Dozens of people attended without wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. After complaints from neighbours and videos surfaced on social media, Calabasas mayor Alicia Weintraub expressed outrage, saying, "They're having this large party, no social distancing, no masks, it’s just a big huge disregard for everything that everybody is trying to do to get things back to functioning."

On November 25, 2020, Paul attracted further COVID-related controversy due to statements in an interview with ''[[The Daily Beast]]''. When interviewer Marlow Stern asked Paul if he regretted his words and actions regarding the July 11 party, Paul responded by saying that COVID-19 was a "[[Misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic|hoax]]", also stating that "98 percent of news [about COVID-19] is fake", and that he believed the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|measures against COVID-19 in the United States]] should end, calling them "the most detrimental thing to our society." He then incorrectly stated that the [[Influenza|flu]] had killed as many people in the United States in 2020 as COVID-19 did, and claimed that "Medical professionals have [recently] also said that masks do absolutely nothing to prevent the spread of coronavirus"; he later referred to said professionals as "dozens of my medical friends." When Stern tried to question his claims, Paul told Stern "You're arrogant. You're very arrogant", "you want clickbait", and "I've never even heard of you."<ref name="DailyBeastCOVIDHoax">{{Cite news |last=Torres |first=Ella |date=July 16, 2020 |title=Jake Paul Believes COVID Is 'a Hoax' and '98% of News Is Fake' |work=[[The Daily Beast]] |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/youtuber-jake-paul-believes-covid-is-a-hoaxand-i-am-fake-news?ref=scroll |url-status=live |access-date=July 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200716204238/https://abcnews.go.com/US/youtube-star-jake-paul-slammed-mayor-outrageous-party/story?id=71817831 |archive-date=July 16, 2020}}</ref><ref name="PageSixCOVIDHoax">{{Cite news |last=Bitsky |first=Leah |date=November 25, 2020 |title=Partying YouTuber Jake Paul thinks COVID-19 is a hoax |work=[[New York Post|Page Six]] |url=https://pagesix.com/2020/11/25/partying-youtuber-jake-paul-thinks-covid-19-is-a-hoax/ |access-date=November 26, 2020}}</ref><ref name="InsiderCOVIDHoax">{{Cite news |last=E.

===Attending a riot at an Arizona mall and FBI raid===
On May 30, 2020, Paul and a few of his friends came to have dinner at [[P. F. Chang's]] outside of [[Scottsdale Fashion Square]] in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], as part of the [[George Floyd protests]], where it escalated quickly and people began looting the mall. Multiple instances of footage show Paul and his friends outside of a P. F. Chang's witnessing the riot and they made their way inside the mall where they documented the incident.

===Investigated in Puerto Rico===
On May 15, 2021, Paul was investigated by the [[Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources]] for riding a motorized vehicle on [[Puerto Rico]]'s beaches, seen on a video which was posted online but then removed.
