'''Serebro''' ({{lang-rus|Серебро|t=Silver|p=sʲɪrʲɪˈbro|a=ru-серебро.ogg}}; stylized as '''SEREBRO''') was a Russian [[girl group]] formed by their manager and producer [[Maxim Fadeev]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BuYqVtIBUu0/|title = Login • Instagram}}</ref> Serebro was formed in 2007, consisting of [[Marina Lizorkina]], [[Olga Seryabkina]], and [[Elena Temnikova]] as a submitted proposal for consideration by [[Channel One Russia]] for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007]]. Serebro was selected to [[Russia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007|represent Russia]] at the 2007 Contest with the song titled "[[Song Number 1|Song #1]]". They subsequently placed third at the contest, scoring a total of 207 points. Serebro was then officially signed to Fadeev's record label [[Maxim Fadeev|Monolit Records]], and in 2012, the group had additional releases produced by [[Sony Music Entertainment]] and Ego Music. In 2009, Lizorkina announced her departure from the group; she was subsequently replaced by [[Anastasia Karpova]]. Karpova left the group in 2013 and was replaced by Dasha Shashina, who left in 2016. Temnikova left the group in 2014 due to health reasons, and Polina Favorskaya, who replaced Temnikova, left the group in 2017. Favorskaya was later replaced by Morgunova. In 2019, the line-up [[Olga Seryabkina]], Katya Kischuk, and Tatiana Morgunova, the last one to include the last original member, has been replaced by Elizaveta Kornilova, Marianna Kochurova and Irina Titova.

With Lizorkina at the time, the band recorded their debut studio album ''[[OpiumRoz]]''. The album received critical acclaim and spawned other singles in addition to "Song #1", but it never became a commercial success. The band's second album, called ''[[Mama Lover]]'', proved to be much more successful. It included the massive hit of the [[Mama Lover (song)|same name]] and went double platinum in Russia. The eponymous "Mama Lover" hit single received media attention worldwide, with reviewers commenting on both the raunchy music video and the song itself. The music video for the song received more than 20 million views on [[YouTube]] and became the subject of more than 250 parodies. After the success of "Mama Lover", the group began to garner commercial attention around the world. The group re-released ''Mama Lover'' in Japan (under the name ''Serebration'') after signing a contract with [[EMI Music]]. Their first international single under Ego Music and [[Universal Music Group]], "[[Mi Mi Mi]]", became a success on European music charts.

After their musical and image development, the group became known for a very [[Human sexual activity|sexually charged]] and over the top style. Some of their music videos have led to controversy in the media, including "Mama Lover" and "Mi Mi Mi".

==History==
===Formation and Eurovision Song Contest 2007===
[[File:ESC 2007 Russia - Serebro - Song No 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Serebro performs "Song #1" at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007]] in [[Helsinki]].]]

In early 2007, producer [[Maxim Fadeev]] began preparing a concept for a new band titled Serebro. The concept began as a proposal for [[Channel One Russia]] for a new Russian entry into the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007]]. Despite original indications that the concept was for a solo singer, it morphed into a group around the former [[Star Factory]] participant [[Elena Temnikova]] who was paired with two newcomers: [[Marina Lizorkina]] and [[Olga Seryabkina]].<ref name=Serebro1>{{cite web|first=Andy|last=Mikheev|title=Eurovision 2007 Rusia|url=http://www.esckaz.com/2007/rus.htm|work=ESCKaz|access-date=23 July 2013}}</ref> On 8 March 2007, the expert panel at Channel One Russia selected Serebro and the song "[[Song Number 1|Song #1]]" as [[Russia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007|Russia's entry]] to the 2007 Eurovision Song Contest.<ref name=Serebro1/> Due to Russia's successful result in the 2006 Contest, Serebro pre-qualified to compete directly in the final of the competition without having to participate in the semi-final.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

On 12 May 2007, Serebro performed at the contest and placed third in a field of 24 musical acts from competing nations, scoring 207 points. Serebro later said: "We are happy because of our third place. But, the most important thing is that we weren't there because of ourselves, it was for our fans, for Russia and for the Russian people". The performance in [[Helsinki]] became their first official release and first concert for a large live audience.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===2007—2008: Debut and ''OpiumRoz''===
After the success at [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007]] in [[Helsinki]], Serebro rapidly became one of the most popular bands in Russia. Starting in the summer of 2007, the group gave a number of concerts and performed at events throughout Russia, [[Kazakhstan]], Turkey, Poland, [[Uzbekistan]], and [[Belarus]]. All of the band's singles, without their real titles, are named Song #1, #2, #3, etc. According to the group and their management, this should make it easier to recall their songs.

Soon after the Eurovision contest, Serebro released "[[Song Number 1|Song #1]]" as a single CD, which contained 13 different versions of "Song #1" marked by colours, as well as an extended version of the video. The girls then released a Russian version of "Song #1", called "[[Song Number 1#Песня#1|Песня #1]]". It was Serebro's first Russian single. The song was a commercial success worldwide, particularly in European markets. The song charted in countries including Russia, Switzerland, Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom. As soon as the music video was release, the group received much commercial attention. In July 2007, the group released their second song, "[[Dyshi|Дыши]]". Though the song was somewhat commercially successful in their native Russia, the song did not chart around the globe and the group saw a marked drop in the level of commercial attention globally. Later in October, a video for "[[Dyshi|Дыши]]" was released.

At the [[MTV Russian Music Awards|RMA awards]] in early October 2007, Serebro performed a new song titled "What's Your Problem?", which was then rumored to be the third single from the then-forthcoming studio album, but this was denied in reports. Serebro was nominated in four categories at the [[MTV Russian Music Awards|MTV RMA 2007 awards]]: Best Pop-project, Best Debut, Best Song and Best Video, only to win the second nomination. In December 2007, Serebro won another award at the Russian Grammies. Serebro also won a [[World Music Award]] in 2007 as the best selling Russian artist. Unlike previous eastern European winners of a World Music Award (e.g. [[Ruslana]] from [[Ukraine]] in 2004 and [[Dima Bilan]] for Russia in 2006), Serebro did not perform at the event.

In late February, Serebro performed "[[Zhuravli|Журавли]]" on ''[[Zvezda (TV channel)|Звэзда]]'', a popular television programme in Russia, featuring artists singing patriotic songs. Originally written as a poem by [[Rasul Gamzatov]] "Журавли" is one of the most famous Russian songs coming out of World War II. On 13 May 2008 Serebro announced on their official website that they will be releasing their third official single, called "[[Opium (Serebro song)|Опиум]]". The song premiered on a Russian morning radio show ''BrigadaU'' on [[Europa Plus]] radio and until 17 March 2008 Europa Plus held exclusive rights to play the song.  The girls also announced an English version of "Опиум" titled "Why", but it was not released until its inclusion on their second studio album in 2012. The song did not enjoy worldwide success, but had success in their native Russia.

In 2008 the group continued their work on their first album, ''[[OpiumRoz]]'',<ref name="kp.ru">{{cite web|url=http://www.kp.ru/daily/press/detail/1472/ |title=Собираются ли девчонки из "Серебра" замуж? // |publisher=Kp.ru |access-date=2012-10-07}}</ref> which had a projected release date of 17 October.<ref name="Fadeev">{{cite web |author=Александр Пылов |url=http://www.fadeev.ru/serebro.htm |title=Макс Фадеев &#124; Silver-Серебро-Serebro |publisher=Fadeev.ru |access-date=2012-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518172109/http://www.fadeev.ru/serebro.htm |archive-date=18 May 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Unfortunately, there was a delay in the release of their [[OpiumRoz|debut album]] as there were some problems in the track list.<ref name="News">{{cite web|url=http://serebro.su/?go=news |title=Официальный сайт группы "СЕРЕБРО" &#124;&#124; Новости |publisher=Serebro.su |access-date=2012-10-07}}</ref> In November, the girls released the new song, "[[Skazhi, ne Molchi|Скажи, не Молчи]]" ("Say, Don't be silent").<ref name="Fadeev"/> The song did not achieve worldwide success, but managed to score the top spots in their native Russia. A music video was also aired for the single not long after its final release. In November 2008, Serebro was awarded by [[MTV Russian Music Awards|MTV RMA Awards for the Best Group]]. After a number of delays with their debut album, ''[[OpiumRoz]]'', it was finally released on 25 April 2009, and was presented at the band's concert on [[Poklonnaya Hill]].<ref name="Opiumroz">{{cite web|url=http://www.serebro.su/?go=news |title=Официальный сайт группы "СЕРЕБРО" &#124;&#124; Новости |publisher=Serebro.su |access-date=2012-10-07}}</ref> Serebro was supported by other musicians, including Russian entrant to the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004]] [[Yulia Savicheva]];<ref name="Opiumroz"/> ''OpiumRoz'' was the result of two years recording.<ref name="Opiumroz"/> Positive reactions came from both critics and the public alike.

On 15 September 2011, the music video for Mama Luba (Russian version of "Mama Lover") was released.
