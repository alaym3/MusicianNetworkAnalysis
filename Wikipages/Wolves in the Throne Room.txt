'''Wolves in the Throne Room''' is an American [[black metal]] band formed in 2003 in [[Olympia, Washington]]<ref name="bio">{{cite web|title=Official Biography|url=http://wittr.com/bio|access-date=2014-07-11|publisher=Wittr.com}}</ref> by brothers Aaron and Nathan Weaver. They have released seven full-length albums, two live albums, and one EP to date. They have stated one of the founding concepts of the band to be channeling the "energies of the Pacific Northwest's landscape" into musical form.<ref name="bio" />

==History==
=== Formation and ''Diadem of 12 Stars'' (2003–2006) ===
Brothers Aaron and Nathan Weaver formed the band in 2003.<ref name="bio" /> Their first practice took place in a falling-down cabin located on the then-abandoned and overgrown Calliope Farm, which they had recently moved to. Nathan met Nick Paul at a local party and the three began to write material for their first demo. At the time, Nick was heavily influenced by [[thrash metal]], [[speed metal]], and [[death metal]], citing bands like [[Death (metal band)|Death]] and [[Bolt Thrower]], as well as [[post-punk]] and [[gothic rock]] influences such as [[Swans (band)|Swans]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], and [[Fields of the Nephilim]]. Aaron and Nathan's musical style was more informed by [[Crust punk|crust]], [[Doom metal|doom]], Norwegian black metal and American black metal.

The band's first release was their 2004 demo, a black CD-R wrapped in fur with moss inside the lyric sheet.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aquarius Records|url=http://www.aquariusrecords.org/bin/search.cgi|work=Aquarius Records}}</ref> Nick Paul left the band soon after the first demo was recorded.

Richard Dalahn joined the band in early 2005. They then began working on material for a second demo, which would end up including 2 tracks off of their first studio album [[Diadem of 12 Stars]].

Their debut full-length album ''[[Diadem of 12 Stars]]'' was released in 2006.<ref name="Gnade">Gnade, Adam (2006) "[http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/Content?oid=68871&category=22153 Forest Doom: Black Wolves Hunt Souls in the Throne Room]", ''[[Portland Mercury]]'', October 5, 2006, retrieved December 24, 2011</ref> Diadem was recorded with a budget of $1100 by Tim Green at Louder Studios in San Francisco.<ref name="Grow">Grow, Kory (2005) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=GSsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA15&dq=%22wolves+in+the+throne+room%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=zST2TsuOMMWt8gOl2aC6AQ&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22wolves%20in%20the%20throne%20room%22&f=false Wolves in the Throne Room]", ''[[CMJ New Music Monthly]]'', Issue 139, p. 15, retrieved December 24, 2011</ref><ref name="Black Metal on Their Own Terms">{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatemetal.com/forum/interviews/238052-wolves-throne-room-black-metal-their-own-terms.html|title=Black Metal on Their Own Terms|work=Ultimate Metal}}</ref> The band played shows on the way down to San Francisco from Olympia to raise money for the project and borrowed equipment from local band [[Ludicra]].

Nathan had met singer Jamie Myers from the band [[Hammers of Misfortune]] at a squat show in Oakland on a previous tour and asked her to sing on the album. Jamie was nine months pregnant during recording of her vocal tracks.

The album attracted the attention of [[Southern Lord Records]], who signed the band, reissuing it on vinyl.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wolvesinthethroneroom.bandcamp.com/album/diadem-of-12-stars|title=Diadem of 12 Stars, by Wolves in the Throne Room|website=Wolves in the Throne Room|access-date=2016-09-01}}</ref>

The debut record received positive reviews, with Pitchfork stating that, "it's the inclusion of folk and goth that separates Wolves in the Throne Room from the pack, breaking up the madness with moments of poetic clarity."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9074-diadem-of-12-stars/|title=Wolves in the Throne Room: Diadem of 12 Stars Album Review {{!}} Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|access-date=2017-01-17}}</ref>

Aaron Weaver has also described their music as "striving to operate on the mythic level", commenting that "I think there's this sense that we've lost something and we can't have it back. And maybe it's not something we ever wanted to begin with. That sense of despair and loss and you don't even know what you lost. That's one of the central themes in black metal and that runs through our records as well." He went on to add that one of the central ideals of the band is "the idea of uncovering the occult or the spiritual or the energetic reality of place. Being deeply connected to a place and creating music and art that rises up out of a landscape."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westword.com/music/aaron-weaver-of-wolves-in-the-throne-room-about-the-mythic-levels-his-band-operates-on-5711434|title=Aaron Weaver of Wolves in the Throne Room about the mythic levels his band operates on|last=Murphy|first=Tom|date=2011-09-30|access-date=2016-09-01}}</ref>
