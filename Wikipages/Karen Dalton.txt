'''Karen J. Dalton''' (born '''Jean Karen Cariker'''; July 19, 1937 &ndash; March 19, 1993) was an American [[country blues|folk blues]] [[singing|singer]], guitarist, and [[banjo]] player. She was associated with the early 1960s [[American folk music revival|Greenwich Village folk music scene]], particularly with [[Fred Neil]], the [[Holy Modal Rounders]], and [[Bob Dylan]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5691531|title=Ordinary Songs Become Memorable Events|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-03-18|language=en}}</ref> Although she did not enjoy much commercial success during her lifetime, her music has gained significant recognition since her death. Artists like [[Nick Cave]],<ref name=":5" /> [[Devendra Banhart]],<ref name=":6" /> and [[Joanna Newsom]]<ref name=":7" /> have noted her as an influence.

==Life and career==
Dalton was born '''Jean Karen Cariker''' in [[Bonham, Texas]],<ref name=":0">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/mar/23/folk |title=The best singer you've never heard of |first=Laura |last=Barton |author-link=Laura Barton |date=23 March 2007 |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=2021-05-06}}</ref> but was raised in [[Enid, Oklahoma]]. She also lived in [[Stillwater, Oklahoma]], and [[Lawrence, Kansas]].<ref>{{cite news | title=For Karen Dalton, a long way home | url=https://newsok.com/article/feed/862317/for-karen-dalton-a-long-way-home | agency=[[Associated Press]] | date= 12 July 2015}}</ref> Her heritage was half Cherokee and half Irish.  With two divorces behind her at the age of 21, Dalton left Oklahoma and arrived in [[Greenwich Village]], New York City in the early 1960s.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92456345|title=Karen Dalton: A Reluctant Voice, Rediscovered|last=Rose|first=Joel|date=July 12, 2008|website=NPR}}</ref> She brought her [[Twelve-string guitar|twelve string guitar]], long-neck [[banjo]], and at least one of her two children with her.<ref name=":0" /> According to her daughter Abralyn Baird, at that point Dalton had lost two of her bottom teeth breaking up a fight between two of her boyfriends.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://timeline.com/karen-dalton-folk-tragic-8c042745bdc7|title=With a scorched-earth voice and a tragic downfall, Karen Dalton's music reflected her life|last=Aron|first=Nina Renata|date=November 8, 2017|website=Timeline}}</ref>

=== Greenwich Village scene ===
Dalton quickly became entrenched in the Greenwich Village folk musical scene of the 1960s. She played alongside big names of the time, including [[Bob Dylan]] (who occasionally backed her up on harmonica),<ref name=":1" /> [[Fred Neil]], Richard Tucker, and [[Tim Hardin]].<ref name=":0" /> She covered many of their songs in her own performances. Dylan later wrote that "Karen had a voice like [[Billie Holiday]] and played guitar like [[Jimmy Reed]].”<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Chronicles_Volume_1/h97UxHlubtMC?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=KAREN%20DALTON|isbn = 9780857209580|title = Chronicles Volume 1|date = July 7, 2011|publisher = Simon and Schuster}}</ref> She was among the first to sing Hardin's "[[Reason to Believe]]". She later married Tucker, with whom she sometimes played as a duo, and in a trio with Hardin.

While Dalton was a regular at famous folk venue [[Cafe Wha?|Café Wha?]] and performed at benefit concerts for civil rights groups,<ref>{{Cite book|title=KAREN DALTON: Songs, Poems, and Writings: Songs, Poems, and Writings|last=Walker|first=Peter|publisher=Ark Press|year=2012|isbn=978-1-939374-00-4|location=Woodstock, NY}}</ref> she was a reluctant performer and refused to perform her own songs.<ref name=":2" /> Combined with her use of alcohol and heroin, recording her music and touring was particularly hard.<ref name=":3" />

Dalton moved to Colorado with husband Richard Tucker and daughter Abralyn (Abbe) and lived there for a while in the 1960s, in a small mining cabin in Summerville. Eventually she moved back to New York via Los Angeles, and then to Woodstock, New York.<ref name=":2" />

===''It's So Hard to Tell Who's Going to Love You the Best'' (album) ===
Dalton was "not interested in playing the music industry's games in an era when musicians had little other choice," as bass player and producer [[Harvey Brooks (bassist)|Harvey Brooks]] noted.<ref name=":1" /> She often responded in anger when producers attempted to change her music while recording.

At first, producer Nik Venet was unsuccessful in recording her first album, ''[[It's So Hard to Tell Who's Going to Love You the Best]]'' ([[Capitol Records|Capitol]], 1969). It wasn't until he invited Fred Neil to a session that they were able to come away with recordings. Even then, Venet and Neil were only successful by tricking Dalton into thinking the tape wasn't rolling.<ref name=":0" /> Dalton cut most of the tracks with one take, and all in one night.<ref name=":3" /> The record features songs from Neil, Hardin, [[Jelly Roll Morton]], and [[Eddie Floyd]] & [[Booker T. Jones]].<ref name=":3" /> It was re-released by [[Koch Records]] on CD in 1996.

=== ''In My Own Time'' (album) ===
Dalton's second album, ''[[In My Own Time (album)|In My Own Time]]'' (1971), was recorded at [[Bearsville Studios]] (which was set up by Bob Dylan's manager, [[Albert Grossman]])<ref name=":0" /> and originally released by [[Woodstock Festival]] promoter [[Michael Lang (producer)|Michael Lang]]'s label, [[Just Sunshine Records]].<ref name=":0" /> The album was produced and arranged by [[Harvey Brooks (bassist)|Harvey Brooks]], who played bass on it. Piano player [[Richard Bell (Canadian musician)|Richard Bell]] guested on the album. Its liner notes were written by Fred Neil and its cover photos were taken by [[Elliott Landy]]. Dalton brought her two teenage children, her dog, and her horse from Oklahoma to feel more at ease with recording.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/6ev7er/karen-dalton-the-most-tragically-beautiful-folk-singer-youve-probably-never-heard-of|title=Karen Dalton: The Most Tragically Beautiful Folk Singer You've Probably Never Heard Of|last=Way|first=Mish|date=January 4, 2013|website=Vice}}</ref>

=== Re-releases and tributes ===
''It's So Hard to Tell Who's Going to Love You the Best'' was re-released on Koch Records in 1997, in collaboration with New York-based radio DJ and Karen Dalton fan Nicholas Hill, and with liner notes by [[Peter Stampfel]]. In 1999 the French label Megaphone music did a European re-release of the same album, which included a bonus DVD featuring rare performance footage of Dalton and a French TV feature on Karen Dalton from 1970. ''In My Own Time'' was re-released on CD and LP on November 7, 2006 by [[Light in the Attic Records]].

Two recordings from 1962 and 1963, previously owned by Karen's friend Joe Loop who ran the little club "The Attic" in Boulder in the early 60's, were released on Megaphone in 2007 and 2008 as live album [[Cotton Eyed Joe (album)|''Cotton Eyed Joe'']] and the home-recorded album ''Green Rocky Road.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91632808|title=Karen Dalton: Blues from Beyond the Grave|last=Thompson|first=Stephen|date=June 18, 2008|website=NPR}}</ref>''

The compilation tribute album, ''Remembering Mountains: Unheard Songs by Karen Dalton'', was released in 2015 by folk label Tompkins Square.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-ms-karen-dalton-20150526-column.html|title=Review: Folk singer Karen Dalton gets remarkable tribute in 'Remembering Mountains' album|last=Roberts|first=Randall|date=May 25, 2015|website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> In similar fashion to Wilco and Billy Bragg’s adaptions of Woody Guthrie songs in ''[[Mermaid Avenue]]'', the album features adaptations of Dalton's work by artists including [[Patty Griffin]], [[Lucinda Williams]], [[Josephine Foster]], [[Sharon Van Etten]], and [[Julia Holter]]. The songs feature lyrics and poems Dalton wrote before her death, which were in the care of her friend, folk guitarist [[Peter Walker (guitarist)|Peter Walker]].<ref name=":4" />

== Style ==
Dalton's bluesy, world-weary voice is often compared to [[jazz]] [[singing|singer]] [[Billie Holiday]], though Dalton loathed the comparison<ref name=":0" /> and said [[Bessie Smith]] was a greater influence. Dalton sang blues, folk, country, pop, [[Motown]]—making over each song in her own style. She played the [[twelve string guitar]] and a long-neck [[banjo]].

Known as "the folk singer's answer to Billie Holiday" and "Sweet Mother K.D.", Dalton is said to be the subject of the song "Katie's Been Gone" (composed by [[Richard Manuel]] and [[Robbie Robertson]]) on the album ''[[The Basement Tapes]]'' by [[The Band]] and [[Bob Dylan]], who wrote of Dalton that "My favorite singer...was Karen Dalton. Karen had a voice like Billie Holiday and played guitar like [[Jimmy Reed]]... I sang with her a couple of times."<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Chronicles: Volume One]]|last=Dylan|first=Bob|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2004|isbn=0-7432-2815-4}} (Page 12.)</ref> Fred Neil once remarked, "She sure can sing the shit out of the blues."<ref name=":0" />

Modern artists [[Adele]], [[Nick Cave]],<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/nick-cave-at-the-abbey-a-funny-strange-and-beautiful-evening-1.3521061|title=Nick Cave at the Abbey: A funny, strange and beautiful evening|last=Freyne|first=Patrick|date=June 6, 2018|website=The Irish Times}}</ref> [[Devendra Banhart]],<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/music/devendra-banhart-loves-karen-dalton-now-you-can-too/|title=Devendra Banhart loves Karen Dalton — Now You Can Too|last=Farrar|first=Justin|date=November 21, 2007|website=SF Weekly}}</ref> and [[Joanna Newsom]]<ref name=":7">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/inherent-vice-joanna-newsom-1970s-songs|title=_Inherent Vice'_s Joanna Newsom Shares Her Favorite Songs from the Seventies|last=Frank|first=Alex|date=January 15, 2015|website=Vogue}}</ref> have all noted her as an influence. So does country singer [[Lacy J. Dalton]], who knew Dalton in Greenwich Village and adopted her surname as a tribute.<ref name=":0" />

== Later life and death ==
Commercial failure of her album ''In My Own Time'' and her estrangement from her children contributed to further substance abuse later in Dalton's life.<ref name=":0" />

In later years, Dalton lived in a mobile home located in a clearing off Eagle's Nest Road, outside the town of [[Hurley, New York|Hurley]], near Woodstock.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/ec8ae580-45b3-11e1-93f1-00144feabdc0.html|title=Play, lady, play|last=Clayton|first=Richard|date=2012-01-27|newspaper=Financial Times|access-date=2016-02-11|issn=0307-1766}}</ref>

Friend [[Lacy J. Dalton]] helped send her to rehab in Texas in the early 1990s; a stay which lasted only a couple of days before she demanded to be taken back home to Woodstock again. She died there in March 1993 from an [[AIDS]]-related illness, aged 55. According to her friend [[Peter Walker (guitarist)|Peter Walker]], she had been living with the disease for more than eight years.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2008-02-08/589038/|title=In Her Own Time|website=www.austinchronicle.com|access-date=2016-02-11}}</ref>

== Documentary ==
A documentary, ''Karen Dalton: In My Own Time'', from filmmakers Richard Peete and Robert Yapkowitz, made its world premiere at [[Doc NYC]] in November 2020. Sheri Linden in [[The Hollywood Reporter]] writes, "As it introduces a one-of-a-kind artist to the uninitiated and celebrates her for aficionados, above all it listens — and invites us to do the same."<ref>{{Cite web|title='In My Own Time: A Portrait of Karen Dalton': Film Review {{!}} DOC NYC 2020 {{!}} Hollywood Reporter|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/in-my-own-time-a-portrait-of-karen-dalton-film-review-doc-nyc-2020|access-date=2020-11-22|website=www.hollywoodreporter.com}}</ref>
