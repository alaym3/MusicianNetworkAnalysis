'''Zimmers Hole''' is a Canadian [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Vancouver]]. The band formed in 1991, and features former [[Strapping Young Lad]] members [[Byron Stroud]], [[Jed Simon]] and [[Gene Hoglan]], along with vocalist [[Chris Valagao]].

== History ==
=== ''Bound by Fire'' ===
Zimmers Hole began life as a side project for members and friends of [[Strapping Young Lad]]. The band's debut album ''[[Bound by Fire]]'' was produced by [[Devin Townsend]] and released on his label [[Hevy Devy Records]]. The band was named after the [[sphincter]] of the band's late mutual friend Dean Zimmer, who would chase other people with his buttcheeks spread during parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zptd7GkOfJw&t=247|title=The Legend of Zimmer's Hole|last=Devin Townsend|date=September 3, 2016|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1585215/zimmers-hole-frontmans-spit-made-into-artwork-plus-guns-n-roses-slipknot-more-news-that-rules-in-metal-file/|title=Zimmers Hole Frontman's Spit Made Into Artwork; Plus Guns N' Roses, Slipknot & More News That Rules, In Metal File|website=Mtv.com}}</ref> Lyrics took inspiration from comedic anecdotes from tours past,<ref name="Bound By Fire Lyrics">{{cite web|url=http://www.metal.ee/devyworld/others/zimmer-lyrics.htm|title=Zimmers Hole - Bound By Fire Lyrics|date=January 1, 1998|website=Baldmosher.com|access-date=June 8, 2012}}</ref> backed by middle-of-the-road "metal flying V riffs", usually stolen from Kiss and Morbid Angel. Details of the bizarre back stories for all the songs were provided by Chris Valagao ("'Gospel Sodomy Boy on Blow' is about an asshole called Troy who wouldn't stop doing coke and spouting about Jesus") and posted on the official Strapping Young Lad forums by Tracy Turner around 1999.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

=== ''Legion of Flames'' ===
In 2001, when Strapping Young Lad finished touring, Jed Simon and Byron Stroud had Townsend to produce the second album, ''[[Legion of Flames]]''. It was released on Townsend's label [[Hevy Devy Records]]. ''Legion of Flames'' included song parodies such as "Gender of the Beast" ("Number of the Beast", [[Iron Maiden]]), "Sodomanaz" ("Go for a Soda", [[Kim Mitchell]]), and a spoof of [[Metallica]]'s "Master of Puppets" in the song "Evil Robots", with the line "Napster, Napster, where's the cash that I've been after?". The album also contained a cover of [[Joni Mitchell]]'s "This Flight Tonight", with humorously altered lyrics.

=== ''When You Were Shouting at the Devil...'' ===
In August 2007, Zimmers Hole signed with [[Century Media Records]] for the release of the band's third studio album.<ref name="Signed">{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=78077|title=Zimmers Hole Signs Worldwide Deal with Century Media, Enters Studio|date=August 3, 2007|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=August 3, 2008}}</ref> Stroud and Simon said:
{{cquote|Now with Zimmers Hole signing a fresh, new deal with Century Media, we have decided to give this band our full and undivided attention. No more 'side-project' status here; the men of the HOLE are fired up like a city on fire and we entered Vancouver's famed [[Armoury Studios]] today to begin tracking the new release. [...] As you can see, it's all about having a good time with the HOLE. Make no mistake though, we are very serious about our love of metal; it made us who we are, and we wear our influences on our sleeves proudly. We are now more focused than ever before and are so excited about the new album. So excited in fact, that the combined length of our erections may just reach out and touch ya!<ref name="Signed" />}}

Shortly after, drummer Steve Wheeler left the band, and in December 2007 was replaced by [[Gene Hoglan]], another former Strapping Young Lad member. Hoglan joined in time to start recording the new album.<ref name="Joins">{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=86213|title=Gene Hoglan Joins Zimmers Hole|date=December 5, 2007|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=August 3, 2008}}</ref> With this roster, Zimmers Hole includes three former Strapping Young Lad members, and Townsend is involved as vocal producer.<ref name="When">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1314699|pure_url=yes}}|title=When You Were Shouting at the Devil > Review|last=Henderson|first=Alex|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=August 3, 2008}}</ref> The band entered Vancouver's [[Armoury Studios]] in the same month to record the album. ''[[When You Were Shouting at the Devil... We Were in League with Satan]]'' was released on March 11, 2008, through Century Media Records.<ref name="album details">{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=89140|title=Zimmers Hole: New Album Details Revealed|date=January 23, 2008|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=August 3, 2008}}</ref>

In an interview with [[MTV]] on April 2008, Valagao explained the origin of the album's name:
{{cquote|I believe [[David Vincent (musician)|David Vincent]] of [[Morbid Angel]] was having a conversation with one of the guys from [[Forbidden (band)|Forbidden]]," he recalled. "They were drinking and fucking around, and they got into this argument over who's more metal. The dude from Forbidden, at one point, turned to Dave and said, "Dude, when you were [[Shout at the Devil|shouting at the devil]] [a reference to [[Mötley Crüe]]], I was [[Welcome to Hell|in league with Satan]] [a reference to [[Venom (band)|Venom]]]," and Jed was in the room and picked up on that. So we started saying it as a joke. That little statement applies to a whole bunch of shit. Basically, "When you were a poseur, I was the real deal".<ref name="MTV">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1585215/20080410/zimmers_hole.jhtml|title=Zimmers Hole Frontman's Spit Made Into Artwork; Plus Guns N' Roses, Slipknot & More News That Rules|last=Harris|first=Chris|date=2008-04-11|website=Mtv.com|access-date=2008-08-03}}</ref>}}
