==Early life and education==
Vanessa-Mae was born on 27 October 1978 in [[Singapore]], to a Singaporean mother Pamela Soei Luang Tan and Thai father Vorapong Vanakorn.  After adoption by a British father, she moved to London at the age of 4 where she began playing the violin, having already started the piano in Singapore. At the age of eight Vanessa-Mae embarked upon an intensive period of study with Professor Lin Yao Ji at the National Conservatoire of Music in Beijing. Vanessa-Mae returned to London and entered London's Royal College of Music.

==Musical career==
At age thirteen, Vanessa-Mae became the youngest soloist to record both the [[Beethoven]] and [[Tchaikovsky]] violin concertos, according to ''[[Guinness World Records]]''.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=Guinness World Records | publisher=[[Guinness World Records]] Ltd | year=2003 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec00folk/page/191 191] | isbn=978-1-892051-17-2 | title=Guinness World Records 2003 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec00folk/page/191 }}</ref>

Her first pop-style album, ''[[The Violin Player]]'', was released in 1995. She appeared on the 1997 [[Janet Jackson]] album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'' playing a violin solo on the song "Velvet Rope".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/pnhf|title=Review of Janet Jackson – ''The Velvet Rope''|first=Daryl|last=Easlea|year=2010|publisher=BBC Review}}</ref>

She was managed by her mother until Vanessa-Mae fired her in 1999.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3558008/Vanessa-Maes-journey-from-prodigy-to-performer.html| title=Vanessa-Mae's journey from prodigy to performer| first=Michael| last= Deacon| work=The Telegraph| date=7 August 2008| access-date=14 October 2011| location=London}}</ref>

In June 1999 she played at the [[MJ & Friends|Michael Jackson & Friends]] concerts in [[Seoul]] and [[Munich]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NUo-DQAAQBAJ&q=%22michael+jackson+and+friends%22+vanessa+mae&pg=PA25|title=Michael Jackson: Rewind: The Life and Legacy of Pop Music's King|last1=Easlea|first1=Daryl|last2=Chancler|first2=Ndugu|date=2016-10-07|publisher=Race Point Publishing|isbn=9781631063671|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=MJ & Friends Munich|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiYTlASkGOw&t=3600|language=en|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref>

On 7 March 2002 Vanessa-Mae performed a variation of [[Antonio Vivaldi]]: ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|The Four Seasons]]'' – "Summer: III. Presto" during the opening ceremonies of the [[2002 Winter Paralympics]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://saltlake2002legacy.com/paralympics/ceremonies | title = Ceremonies | website = Salt Lake 2002 Legacy | publisher = The Givens Company | location = Redondo Beach, California | access-date = 11 November 2014 }}</ref>

In April 2006, Vanessa-Mae was ranked as the wealthiest young entertainer under 30 in the UK in the [[Sunday Times Rich List]] 2006, having an estimated fortune of about £32&nbsp;million.<ref name="bbc-tops2006richlist">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4927490.stm  |title=Vanessa-Mae tops young rich list |work=BBC News |date=21 April 2006| access-date=11 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/11/vanessa-mae-violinist-banned-skiing-four-years |title = Violinist Vanessa-Mae in four-year skiing ban over fiddled races|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 11 November 2014|agency = Associated Press}}</ref>

===Composition===
Vanessa-Mae has occasionally recorded her own compositions.  Her 1997 album ''[[China Girl: The Classical Album 2]]'' included two pieces in which she shared a writing credit: ''Violin Fantasy on Puccini's 'Turandot''' and ''Reunification Overture'', marking the [[Handover of Hong Kong|reunification of China and Hong Kong]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Living doll |last=Walsh |first=John |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/living-doll-1140568.html |newspaper=The Independent |date=24 January 1998 |access-date=31 December 2011 |location=London}}</ref>

In 2017, ClassicFM compiled a list of the 300 best selling classical albums in the 25 years it has been running. Vanessa-Mae entered three times. ''The Classical Album 1'' reached 244, ''Storm'' reached 135 and her debut mainstream album ''The Violin Player'' is the 76th best selling. The site claims that her total album sales make "her the biggest-selling solo violinist in the chart".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://halloffame.classicfm.com/ultimate-chart/#225 |title=Classic FM Ultimate Chart |website=Halloffame.classicfm.com |access-date=2020-04-27}}</ref>

==Skiing career==
Vanessa-Mae stated that she "started skiing around the same time as I began playing the piano, at around four, before moving to the violin at five",<ref name="Telegraph-2010">{{cite news |title=Vanessa-Mae: I want to be an Olympic skier |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/7932222/Vanessa-Mae-I-want-to-be-an-Olympic-skier.html |access-date=13 June 2011 |newspaper=The Telegraph|date=8 August 2010 |location=London}}</ref> and that it had been her "dream to be a ski bum since I was 14."<ref name="Telegraph-2014-Jan">{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/winter-olympics/10583271/Winter-Olympics-2014-violinist-Vanessa-Mae-to-ski-for-Thailand-at-the-Sochi-Games.html |publisher= The Telegraph (London) |title= Winter Olympics 2014: violinist Vanessa-Mae to ski for Thailand at the Sochi Games |author= Sarah Knapton |date= 20 January 2014 |access-date= 7 February 2014 }}</ref> In 2009 Vanessa-Mae took up residence in the Swiss [[alpine resort]] of [[Zermatt]].<ref name=zermatt>{{cite web| url=http://www.blick.ch/people/international/vanessa-mae-startet-2014-bei-olympia-152164| website=Blick| language=de |title=Ski statt Geige: Vanessa Mae startet 2014 bei Olympia |first=Kaye |last= Anthon | date= 29 July 2010 | access-date=14 October 2011 |quote=Ich fahre so gerne Ski, dass ich meinen Wohnsitz von London nach Zermatt verlegt habe}}</ref> In August 2010, she told ''[[The Telegraph (UK)|The Telegraph]]'', "I am British, but realistically there is no way I could represent my own country, but because my natural father is Thai, they have accepted me."<ref name="Telegraph-2010"/> She registered as a Thai [[alpine skier]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher= FIS (International Ski Federation) |url= http://data.fis-ski.com/dynamic/athlete-biography.html?sector=AL&competitorid=168683&type=result&category=FIS&season=ALL&sort=&discipline=ALL&position=&place=&Submit=Search&limit=50 |title= Vanakorn Vanessa (905000) |access-date= 7 February 2014 }}</ref>

===Qualifying event===
In 2014, Thailand had no Alpine skiers in the top 500, and Olympic rules allowed such countries to send one man and one woman to the Olympics [[slalom skiing|slalom]] and [[giant slalom]], based on alternative criteria: The skier must have 140 points or less, smaller scores being better under the [[International Ski Federation]] (FIS) system,<ref name="Williams"/><ref name="chiangrai-qualifies"/> while starting at least five internationally recognised slalom or giant slalom events.<ref name="Telegraph-2014-Jan"/><ref name="Williams">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/winter-olympics/25802907|title=Violinist Vanessae-Mae set to compete at Winter Olympics|first=Ollie|last=Williams|date=20 January 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=20 January 2014}}</ref><ref name="chiangrai-qualifies">{{cite news |url= http://www.chiangraitimes.com/thai-skier-vanessa-vanakorn-qualifies-for-sochi-2014-winter-olympics.html |work= Chiangrai Times |title= Thai Skier Vanessa Vanakorn Qualifies for Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics |date= 20 January 2014 |access-date= 7 February 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160401192206/http://www.chiangraitimes.com/thai-skier-vanessa-vanakorn-qualifies-for-sochi-2014-winter-olympics.html |archive-date= 1 April 2016 |url-status= dead }}</ref>

At the request of Vanessa-Mae's management and the Thai Olympic Committee, a giant slalom competition was organised by the Alpine Ski Club [[Triglav National Park|Triglav]] and took place on 18 and 19 January 2014 at [[Krvavec Ski Resort|Krvavec]] in Slovenia, and would be the last chance for Vanessa-Mae to achieve the FIS-recognised score to qualify for the February 2014 Olympics.<ref name="fis-decision-20141111">{{cite press release | url = http://www.fis-ski.com/news-multimedia/news/article=decision-fis-hearing-panel-thai-competitions-krvavec-slo.html | title = Decision of FIS Hearing Panel: Thai competitions in Slovenia | date = 11 November 2014 | publisher = [[International Ski Federation]] | location = [[Oberhofen am Thunersee]], Switzerland | access-date = 12 November 2014 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141114002105/http://www.fis-ski.com/news-multimedia/news/article%3Ddecision-fis-hearing-panel-thai-competitions-krvavec-slo.html | archive-date = 14 November 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The event included a national junior championship, in which she was 14 years older than any of the competition.<ref name="chiangrai-qualifies"/>

===Investigation and appeal===
On 10 July 2014 four Slovenian ski competition organisers were reported to have each been given four-year bans on working with Slovenian Ski Union (Smučarska zveza Slovenije) and [[International Ski Federation|FIS]] competitions because of supposedly fixed Sochi Winter Olympics qualifications for the Thai ski team at Krvavec in January 2014<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rtvslo.si/news-in-english/vanessa-mae-qualifies-for-sochi-at-krvavec-ski-resort/327818 |title= Vanessa Mae qualifies for Sochi at Krvavec ski resort |publisher= RTV Slovenia |date= 20 January 2014 |access-date= 10 July 2014}}</ref> – with the only goal to successfully qualify Vanessa Mae.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.24ur.com/sport/zimski_sporti/se-obeta-velik-skandal-obstaja-sum-hudih-krsitev-v-primeru-olimpijskih-kvalifikacij-vanesse-mae-na-krvavcu.html |title= Epilog škandala že znan: prepoved delovanja zaradi primera Mae |publisher= 24ur.com |date= 10 July 2014 |access-date= 10 July 2014 }}</ref> However, no formal bans were ever handed out.

On 11 November 2014, the International Ski Federation (FIS) Hearing Panel issued its own findings about the Krvavec event less than 10 months earlier: The weather was such that no regular race could be held; the competition's referee said that "any comparable competition in Slovenia would have been cancelled". A previously retired competitor took part in the alleged competition solely to lower (improve) the scores of the participants.  The official results of "approximately 23 competitors" for the two races on 18 January included results at least two people who in fact did not attend. The official results for two giant slalom races on 19 January also included results for a person who was not even present at the Krvavec competition. One competitor who fell was given an official timing 10 seconds better than reality, and put in second place in the official results. At least one participant started outside the starting wand; afterward, the starter manually triggered the starting wand.<ref name="fis-decision-20141111"/>

The Hearing Panel issued a worldwide four-year ban against Vanessa-Mae,<ref name="bbc-20141111">{{cite news|title=Vanessa-Mae: Skiing violinist banned for four years|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/winter-sports/30005830|access-date=11 November 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=11 November 2014}}</ref><ref name="fis-decision-20141111"/> two-year ban against the Chief of Race [[Borut Hrobat]], and one-year bans against the FIS Technical Delegate, Chief of Timing, Referee, and Starter.<ref name="fis-decision-20141111"/> FIS president [[Gian-Franco Kasper]] commented to [[Associated Press]] concerning the violations: "Those who have been sanctioned have been sanctioned for good reason. At first we were laughing when we heard it. But then we realised it's quite a serious thing."<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/olympics/vanessa-mae-banned-over-fixed-olympic-qualifiers/2014/11/11/6890bc92-6995-11e4-bafd-6598192a448d_story.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141112150906/http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/olympics/vanessa-mae-banned-over-fixed-olympic-qualifiers/2014/11/11/6890bc92-6995-11e4-bafd-6598192a448d_story.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 12 November 2014 | title = Vanessa-Mae banned over fixed Olympic qualifiers | date = 11 November 2014 | agency = [[Associated Press]] | access-date = 12 November 2014 }}</ref>

As two or more participants worked in combination to violate the rules, the FIS Hearing Panel recommended that all four events during the Krvavec competition be annulled. The Hearing Panel noted that, if the results were to be annulled by the FIS Council, it will mean that Vanessa-Mae, [[Federica Selva]] of San Marino, and [[Ieva Januškevičiūtė]] of Lithuania will have not qualified for the 2014 Olympic Games.<ref name="fis-decision-20141111"/> Vanessa-Mae issued a statement calling the ban "nonsensical"<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/winter-sports/30074880 | title = Violinist Vanessa-Mae to contest 'nonsensical' skiing ban | first = Nick | last = Hope | date = 16 November 2014 | publisher = BBC | access-date = 26 November 2014 }}</ref> and saying "we will" appeal to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://olympictalk.nbcsports.com/2014/11/14/vanessa-mae-challenge-ski-ban-nonsense-olympics/ | title = Vanessa-Mae to challenge ski ban, calls it 'nonsense' | first = Nick | last = Zaccardi | date = 14 November 2014 | work = NBC OlympicTalk | publisher = [[NBC Sports]] | access-date = 26 November 2014 }}</ref>

The FIS Council met on 18 November and cancelled the results of "all four giant slalom races" at Krvavec and issued a press release saying that "Vanessa Vanakorn (THA) who competed in the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games therefore did not qualify and should not have been participating in the Sochi 2014 Games." The FIS Council was of the opinion that Federica Selva and Ieva Januškevičiūtė "were victims of the manipulated races", and forwarded the information to the [[International Olympic Committee]].<ref name="fis-decisions-20141118">{{cite press release | url = http://www.fis-ski.com/mm/Document/document/General/05/84/55/FISCouncilDecisionsNovember2014_Neutral.pdf | title = Decisions of the Autumn 2014 FIS Council Meetings in Oberhofen (SUI) | date = 18 November 2014 | publisher = [[International Ski Federation]] | location = [[Oberhofen am Thunersee]], Switzerland | access-date = 26 November 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924072700/http://www.fis-ski.com/mm/Document/document/General/05/84/55/FISCouncilDecisionsNovember2014_Neutral.pdf | archive-date = 24 September 2015 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Vanessa-Mae filed appeals with the Court of Arbitration for Sport on 4 December 2014 against both the FIS Hearing Panel and the FIS Council.<ref name=VMAppeals>{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/winter-sports/30333147 | title = Violinist Vanessa-Mae appeals against skiing ban | date = 4 December 2014 | publisher = BBC Sport | access-date = 11 February 2015 }}</ref>

On 19 June 2015 the Court of Arbitration for Sport voided Vanakorn's four-year ban, saying there was a lack of evidence that she herself manipulated the races; but the CAS dismissed her appeal to restore the qualifying results, confirming that the qualifying races "were so defective that their results and qualification points gained therefrom could not stand", and therefore "Vanessa Vanakorn remains ineligible to compete in the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games". The Court of Arbitration for Sport's decision also awarded an amount of money to be paid by the International Ski Federation to Ms Vanakorn.<ref name="guardian-overturned"/><ref name="cas-20150619"/>

===Confirmed Olympian status===
Despite Vanessa-Mae's successful result in nullifying the FIS race ban at the CAS appeal, there was still some doubt over the status of her races at the 2014 Winter Olympics. However, in January 2016 the media announced that the [[International Olympic Committee]] had confirmed that Vanessa-Mae could be called an Olympian.<ref name=VMOlympian>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/04/vanessa-mae-violinist-winter-olympics-sochi-2014-result-stands-ioc |title= Vanessa Mae's skiing result at Winter Olympics stands following IOC ruling | date= 4 January 2016 |work= The Guardian}}</ref>

===FIS apology to Vanessa-Mae===
