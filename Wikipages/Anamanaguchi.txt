'''Anamanaguchi''' is an American [[chiptune]]-based [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music|rock]] band from [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anamanaguchi.com/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010072005/http://anamanaguchi.com/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-10-10 |title=Anamanaguchi Home Page as of October 10, 2011 |access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref> The band has four members: lead songwriters and guitarists Peter Berkman and Ary Warnaar, bassist James DeVito, and drummer Luke Silas.<ref>Berkman, Peter, James DeVito, and Ary Warnaar. [http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-08-04/music/anamanaguchi-avoid-the-perils-of-cheap-nostalgia/ "Anamanaguchi Avoid the Perils of Cheap Nostalgia."] Interview by Vijith Assar. The Village Voice. August 4, 2009. Web. August 13, 2009.</ref>

Anamanaguchi combines digital electronic sounds such as those seen in [[chiptune]], [[bitpop]] and [[Nintendocore]] with traditional band instrumentation. As with other chiptune artists, they have created music using [[video game]] hardware from the mid- to late 1980s: namely a [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] and a [[Game Boy]].

The origin of the band's name is unclear. In one interview, Berkman said the name "Anamanaguchi" came about from a member in one of his former bands pronouncing gibberish in the style of [[Jabba the Hutt]].<ref>{{cite web |last = Machkovech |first = Sam |url = http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/5/20/4331048/anamanaguchi-the-ninja-turtles-of-rock |title = Anamanaguchi: The Ninja Turtles of Rock « Polygon |publisher = polygon.com |date = May 23, 2013 |access-date = May 22, 2013 }}</ref> On several other occasions, the band has explained that their name came about after the members worked as interns at [[Armani]] (Berkman and DeVito), [[Prada]] (Warnaar), and [[Gucci]] (Silas) while studying fashion at Parsons School of Design (though three of the four majored in Music Technology at [[New York University]]). People began calling them the "Armani-Prada-Gucci boys," which eventually was [[elision|elided]] into "Anamanaguchi."<ref>{{cite web |url = http://noisey.vice.com/blog/we-talked-to-anamanaguchi-about-bitcoins-and-dick-tricks |title = We Talked to Anamanaguchi About Bitcoin, Memes, and Dick Tricks &#124; NOISEY |publisher = Noisey.vice.com |access-date = June 1, 2013 }}</ref>
