The band played in fraternities and bars regularly before Panic signed a contract with Landslide Records in 1987. In February 1987 the band played the now-legendary series of one dollar Monday night shows at the Uptown Lounge in Athens and the crucial local press began to take notice—FLAGPOLE & Athens Observer art columnist Shan Clark emphasized Widespread Panic's musical virtuosity, songwriting and professionalism. In September of the same year, they recorded their first album, ''[[Space Wrangler]]'', at [[John Keane (record producer)|John Keane]]'s studio in Athens. [[Bruce Hampton|Col.

===1996–2002: Peak touring years and Houser's death===
[[File:Panic Streets Aerial View.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of crowd at ''Light Fuse, Get Away'' CD release party]]

On April 18, 1998, to celebrate the release of their first live album, ''[[Light Fuse, Get Away]]'', Widespread Panic offered a free "CD release party" concert in Athens Georgia. An estimated 80,000–100,000 fans descended on the town, transforming it into one of the largest CD release parties in history.

In 2002, the band received gold certification for their concert DVD ''Live at Oak Mountain''. They also headlined two nights of the first annual [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]] which drew a crowd upwards of 70,000 people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jambands.com/best-of-2002/2003/01/23/widespread-panic-bonnaroo-music-festival-manchester-tn-6-22-23/|title=Widespread Panic, Bonnaroo Music Festival, Manchester, TN- 6/22&23|date=January 23, 2003|website=Jambands.com|access-date=October 20, 2021}}</ref>

In early 2002, guitarist [[Michael Houser]] was diagnosed with [[pancreatic cancer]]. Houser continued to perform with the band into the middle of that year, but following a performance on July 2, 2002 in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]] he left the tour because of his declining health. Guitarist [[George McConnell]], a former bandmate of JoJo Hermann's in [[Beanland (band)|Beanland]], took over as lead guitarist for the remainder of the band's scheduled dates. [[Michael Houser]] died on August 10, 2002.<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/widespreadpanic/articles/story/5934417/widespreads_houser_dead_at_fort] {{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

===2003–2006: George McConnell joins===
In 2003, the band released ''[[Ball (Widespread Panic album)|Ball]]'', the first studio album with McConnell as the guitarist. The album was unique among the band's offerings in that none of the songs included had been performed live by the band prior to the recording. All of the material included was written specifically for the album with the exception of "Time Waits", a song which John Bell had performed in solo appearances, and "Don't Wanna Lose You", a song John Hermann had performed with his side-project Smiling Assassins. Late in 2003, the band announced that they would be taking a hiatus from both recording and performing in 2004. However, 2004 did see the release of three live albums, engineered by Billy Field: ''[[Night of Joy]]'' and ''[[Uber Cobra|Über Cobra]]''—both of which were recorded during a November 2003 three-night run of shows at the [[House of Blues]] in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]]—as well as ''[[Jackassolantern]]'', a compilation of cover songs performed during the band's Halloween shows over the years.  A third release from the Myrtle Beach shows, ''[[Live at Myrtle Beach]]'' was released in early 2005.

In January 2006, the band recorded their 9th studio album, ''[[Earth to America (album)|Earth to America]], ''in Nassau, Bahamas at [[Compass Point Studios]], with [[Terry Manning]] producing. It was released June 13, 2006.

This show was also released in DVD format on November 14, 2006, entitled ''[[Earth to Atlanta]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://widespreadpanic.com/recordnews.php?id=240 |title=News |website=Widespreadpanic.com |access-date=2015-07-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718045526/http://widespreadpanic.com/recordnews.php?id=240 |archive-date=July 18, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On August 2, 2006, nearing the end of the summer tour, the band announced that George McConnell had left the band, making July 30, 2006 at the [[Fox Theatre (St. Louis)|Fox Theater]] in St. Louis, his last show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://widespreadpanic.com/news_story.php?id=235&archive=true |title=George McConnell, lead guitarist with the rock band Widespread Panic, has moved on to further adventures |website=Widespreadpanic.com |access-date=February 25, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129161448/http://widespreadpanic.com/news_story.php?id=235&archive=true |archive-date=November 29, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Producer [[John Keane (record producer)|John Keane]] and former guitar technician Sam Holt filled in on guitar for the remaining two weeks of the tour.

The band continued to tour throughout the rest of 2008 and the spring of 2009.  In the summer of 2009, Widespread Panic teamed up with fellow southern rockers, [[The Allman Brothers]] to do a summer and fall co-headlining tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://widespreadpanic.com/ontour.php |title=Tour Dates and Tickets |publisher=Widespread Panic |access-date=August 13, 2010}}</ref>

On September 29, 2010, Widespread keyboardist Jojo Herman announced that the band would be going on hiatus in 2012. In an interview with ''[[The Vanderbilt Hustler]]'', Herman explained, "Next year will be our 25th anniversary. After that, we're probably going to call it (quits) for awhile. So we're looking forward to next year and going out on a high note."<ref name=InsideVandy>{{cite news|url=http://www.insidevandy.com/drupal/node/14831|title=Q&A with Widespread Panic's Jojo Hermann|last=Kesslering|first=Charlie|work=Insidevandy.com|date=September 29, 2010|access-date=September 29, 2010}}</ref>

The band went on to tour steadily throughout 2011, ending the year with their first show at [[Time Warner Cable Arena]] in Charlotte, North Carolina.  In early 2012, the band played a limited number of shows.  From January to February the band embarked on their first ever tour billed as completely acoustic.  Dubbed the Wood Tour, it started in January at the Fillmore in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]] and ended at The Belly Up in [[Aspen, Colorado]].  Two recordings from the Wood Tour were released in 2012, a special [[Record Store Day]]-only vinyl record entitled ''[[Live Wood (Widespread Panic album)|Live Wood]]'' in April and later ''[[Wood (Widespread Panic album)|Wood]]'', on October 16.

The rest of 2012 saw the band on hiatus but band members were active with other projects.  [[Dave Schools]] toured with the [[Mickey Hart]] Band, [[Jimmy Herring]] recorded a new album and toured with his own band, and Jojo Hermann played shows with the Missing Cats, occasionally opening and sitting in with the North Mississippi Allstars.  On August 17, the band announced their first scheduled shows after hiatus, including two nights in Charlotte, North Carolina and a 4-night run in the Dominican Republic.

Between the two short legs that made up the 2012 Wood Tour, the band played a four night run in Mexico, marking their first shows in the country, and beginning what would become an annual tradition called Panic en la Playa. The first Panic En La Playa was held on the beach at the Now Sapphire Resort in Puerto Morelos, Mexico in 2012. For 2013 and 2014, The concert was held at the Hard Rock Hotel in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, with the 2014 shows pushed back until March 17–20.

The band returned to regular touring in the spring of 2013 with a run of Mid-West and Southern shows beginning in April. During these shows, the band introduced new innovations in the audio broadcast of their live performance. Previously, Panic had allowed tapers to use audience recording devices to simulcast live shows to fans via the internet. The first live taper stream was at the Dodge Theatre in Phoenix, Arizona on 11/04/2009 by Coloartist and was continued by all the WP tapers through the Spring 2013 tour when the band took over streaming duties and started broadcasting live [[soundboard recording]]s of the show via [[Mixlr]].com and the Mixlr smartphone app.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mixlr.com/widespread-panic/me |title=Widespread Panic on Mixlr |publisher=Widespread Panic |access-date=April 29, 2013}}</ref> On December 31, 2013 the band returned to Philips Arena in Atlanta.

2014 saw a return of Wood Tour, with the band playing six all acoustic theater shows, as well as a special Wood performance held 333 feet underground in the Volcano Room at [[Cumberland Caverns]]  in [[McMinnville, Tennessee]] for a taping of an episode of [[PBS]]' [[Bluegrass Underground]]. The band played an extensive 2014 tour, with three-night stands at Red Rocks, [[The Joint (music venue)|The Joint]] at the [[Hard Rock Hotel and Casino (Las Vegas)|Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas]], The [[Riverside Theater (Milwaukee)|Riverside Theater]] in [[Milwaukee]], and [[1stBank Center]] in [[Broomfield, Colorado]], where they played their well-known Halloween shows.<ref>{{cite web|title=Everyday Companion, 2014 Setlists|url=http://www.everydaycompanion.com/asp/tour14.asp|website=Everyday Companion|access-date=1 May 2017}}</ref>

The band closed out 2014 with two shows in Charlotte, North Carolina: the annual Tunes for Tots benefit performance at The Fillmore in Charlotte, North Carolina on 12/30, followed by their annual New Year's Eve show, held this particular year at the TWC Arena in Charlotte, North Carolina.

===2014–present:  Todd Nance departure, reduced touring and Nance's Death===
On October 2, 2014, the band announced that [[Duane Trucks]] would join the band for 2014 fall tour. Trucks temporarily filled in for Todd Nance, who was taking time to attend to personal matters. Nance reunited with the band for four shows in Mexico in early February 2016. However, on February 9, 2016, the band announced that Todd Nance was leaving the band and that, "Duane [Trucks] will be the drummer for Widespread Panic moving forward."<ref name="WSP.com Special Tour Announcement">{{cite web|url=http://www.widespreadpanic.com/news/special-tour-announcement |title=Special Tour Announcement :: News |publisher=Widespread Panic |date=2014-10-02 |access-date=2015-07-25}}</ref> Trucks is the current drummer for [[Hard Working Americans]].

==Live shows==
===Setlists===
Known for never playing the same show twice, the band has a show-to-show ritual of choosing the night's setlist. At the beginning of each tour, a member of the band's road crew makes a master list of all the songs the band performs and laminates it. Each night before the show he marks the last three nights' set lists in different colors. The band can see what has been played recently and then decide what songs to play during the first set. They return to the list during setbreak to pick songs for the second set, and likewise, return after the second set for any additional sets if playing more than two, or the encore. This process is explained by the late Garrie Vereen in the DVD ''[[The Earth Will Swallow You]]''.

===Tapers===
Widespread Panic has the policy of allowing any of their fans to tape, trade, and to a limited extent freely distribute their shows. However, anonymous distribution such as [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|P2P]] and commercial distribution is not permitted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.widespreadpanic.com/qanda.php |title=Contact |publisher=Widespread Panic |access-date=2015-07-25}}</ref> Fans have been taping and trading shows since before they gained national prominence, allowing them to gain their strong national following.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.widespreadpanic.com/interview_detail.php?id=213&type=2 |title=Widespread Panic plays Bethel Woods |access-date=January 29, 2009 |last=Tomcho |first=Sandy |date=July 20, 2007 |newspaper=Bethel Times Herald-Record}}</ref>

===Incidents===
