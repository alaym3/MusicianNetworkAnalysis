When he was almost one year old, Healey lost his sight due to [[retinoblastoma]], a rare cancer of the eyes.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> His eyes had to be surgically removed, and he was given [[Ocular prosthesis|ocular prostheses]].

==Early career and success==
[[File:JeffHealeyAug312002.jpg|thumb|left|Healey performing on August 31, 2002]]
Healey began playing guitar when he was three, developing his unique style of playing the instrument flat on his lap.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> At nine years old, his musical talents were showcased in an interview on the TVOntario children's programme ''[[Cucumber (Canadian TV series)|Cucumber]]''. When he was 15, Healey formed the band Blue Direction,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://jeffhealey.com/2020/10/tale-of-blue-direction/|title=The Tale of Blue Direction|last=Rog|date=October 22, 2020|website=Jeffhealey.com|access-date=October 28, 2020}}</ref> a four-piece that primarily played bar-band cover tunes and featured bassist Jeremy Littler, drummer Graydon Chapman, and schoolmate Rob Quail on second guitar. The band played at clubs in Toronto,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> including the [[Colonial Tavern]].

Healey began hosting a jazz and blues show on radio station [[CIUT-FM]], where he was known for playing from his massive collection of vintage 78 rpm [[phonograph|gramophone]] records.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.cbc.ca/radio2/blog/2008/03/03/jeff_healey_1.html | title=Jeff Healey | website=Cbc.ca | access-date=May 23, 2011}}</ref>

Shortly thereafter he was introduced to bassist Joe Rockman and drummer Tom Stephen, with whom he formed a trio, the Jeff Healey Band. The band made their first public appearance at the Birds Nest, located upstairs at Chicago's Diner on [[Queen Street West]] in Toronto. They received a write-up in Toronto's ''[[Now (newspaper)|NOW]]'' magazine, and soon were playing almost nightly in local clubs, such as Grossman's Tavern and the famed blues club Albert's Hall (where Jeff Healey was discovered by guitarists [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] and [[Albert Collins]]).<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

After being signed to [[Arista Records]] in 1988, the band released the album ''[[See the Light (Jeff Healey album)|See the Light]]'', which appeared on the RPM Top 100 chart in 1989.<ref>[http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/item.aspx?IdNumber=4952& "RPM Top 100 Albums"]. ''RPM Magazine'' Volume 50, No. 24 October 14, 1989.</ref> It featured the hit single "[[Angel Eyes (The Jeff Healey Band song)|Angel Eyes]]" and the song "Hideaway", which was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. While the band was recording ''See the Light'', they were also filming (and recording for the soundtrack of) the [[Patrick Swayze]] film [[Road House (1989 film)|''Road House'']].<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Healey had numerous acting scenes in the movie with Swayze, as his band was the house cover band for the bar featured in the movie.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> In 1990, the band won the [[Juno Award]] for [[Juno Award for Entertainer of the Year|Canadian Entertainer of the Year]]. The albums ''[[Hell to Pay (Jeff Healey album)|Hell to Pay]]'' and ''[[Feel This (album)|Feel This]]'' gave Healey 10 charting singles in Canada between 1990 and 1994, including a [[cover version|cover]] of [[The Beatles]]' "[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]", which featured [[George Harrison]] and [[Jeff Lynne]] on backing vocals and acoustic guitar.<ref>Arista Records LP AL-8632, 1990.</ref>

==Later work and life==
[[File:Jeff Healey in 2007.jpg|thumb|left|Jeff Healey live in 2007 with the Jazz Wizards]]
By the release of the 2000 album ''[[Get Me Some (album)|Get Me Some]],'' Healey began to concentrate his talent in a different musical direction closer to his heart,{{citation needed|date=June 2021}} the appreciation for another original American music form, [[jazz]].

He went on to release three CDs of music of traditional American jazz from the 1920s and 1930s. He had been sitting in with these types of bands around Toronto since the beginning of his music career. Though known primarily as a guitarist, Healey also played trumpet during live performances.  His main jazz group for touring and recording was Jeff Healey's Jazz Wizards.

Healey was an avid [[record collecting|record collector]] and amassed a collection of well over 30,000 [[78 rpm]] records. Starting in 1990 he hosted a radio program of very early jazz on CIUT at the University of Toronto with Colin Bray. Later he went national on CBC Radio's program entitled ''My Kind of Jazz'', in which he played records from his vast vintage jazz collection. He moved the show two years later to Jazz FM - CJRT; as a part of ongoing celebrations for what would have been Healey's 50th birthday in 2016, the latter program began to air in repeats Wednesdays 9pm on jazz.fm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jeffhealey.com/2016/01/the-50th-celebrations-start-now|title=The 50th Celebrations Start Now!|last=Rog|date=January 20, 2016|website=Jeffhealey.com|access-date=March 10, 2019}}</ref>
 
For many years, Healey toured throughout North America and Europe and performed at his club, "Healey's" on [[Bathurst Street, Toronto|Bathurst Street]] in Toronto, where he played with his blues band on Thursday nights and also with his jazz group on Saturday afternoons. The club moved to a bigger location at 56 Blue Jays Way and was rechristened "Jeff Healey's Roadhouse." Though he had lent his name to the club and often played there, Jeff Healey did not own or manage the bar. (The name came from the 1989 film, ''[[Road House (1989 film)|Road House]],'' in which Healey appeared.)
At the time of his death, he had been planning to perform a series of shows in the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Netherlands, with his other band, the Jeff Healey Blues Band (aka the "Healey's House Band") in April 2008.

Over the years, Healey toured and sat in with many well-known performers, including [[The Allman Brothers]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], [[Buddy Guy]], [[BB King]], [[ZZ Top]], [[Steve Lukather]], [[Eric Clapton]] and many more. In 2006, Healey appeared on [[Deep Purple]] vocalist [[Ian Gillan]]'s CD/DVD ''[[Gillan's Inn (album)|Gillan's Inn]].''

Healey discovered and helped develop the careers of other musical artists, including [[Terra Hazelton]], [[Amanda Marshall]],<ref>[http://pages.infinit.net/sonicboy/amanda/ The Ultimate Amanda Marshall Homepage]. Pages.infinit.net. Retrieved on 2011-09-28.</ref> [[Shannon Curfman]], and [[Philip Sayce]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://philipsayce.com/about.html|title=About &#124; Philip Sayce|website=Philipsayce.com|access-date=September 10, 2021}}</ref>

In early 2009, Healey's album ''[[Mess of Blues (Jeff Healey album)|Mess of Blues]]'' won in The 8th Annual Independent Music Awards for Best Blues Album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/jukebox2009.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703183935/http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/jukebox2009.asp|url-status=dead|title=Independent Music Awards – 8th Annual Winners|archive-date=July 3, 2009|access-date=March 7, 2021}}</ref>
