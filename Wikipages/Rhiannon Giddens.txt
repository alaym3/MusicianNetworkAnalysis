==Musical career==
[[File:Rhiannon Giddens TFF 03.JPG|thumb|right|Rhiannon Giddens at Rudolstadt in 2015]]
In 2005, Giddens, who at that time was spending time competing in Scottish music competitions (specializing in the [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] [[lilting]] tradition, also known as mouth music),<ref>{{cite web|last=Wosahla |first=Steve |url=http://nodepression.com/article/carolina-chocolate-drops-digging-back-driving-forward |title=Carolina Chocolate Drops - Digging back, driving forward |publisher=No Depression |date=2008-04-30 |access-date=2017-04-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Sullivan |first=John Jeremiah |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/05/20/rhiannon-giddens-and-what-folk-music-means |title=Rhiannon Giddens and What Folk Music Means |magazine=New Yorker |date=2019-05-13 |access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref> attended the Black Banjo Then and Now Gathering, in [[Boone, North Carolina]]. There she met [[Dom Flemons]] and Sule Greg Wilson. The three started playing together professionally as  a "postmodern string band", Sankofa Strings.<ref>{{cite web|last=Epstein |first=Jon |url=http://clclt.com/charlotte/sankofa-strings/Content?oid=2141147 |title=Sankofa Strings: &#124; Features &#124; Creative Loafing Charlotte |website=Clclt.com |access-date=2017-04-02}}</ref> During that same time period, Giddens was also a regular caller at local [[contra dance]]s and featured in a Celtic music band called Gaelwynd. Later in 2005, after both Gaelwynd and Sankofa Strings had released CD albums, Giddens and Flemons teamed up with other musicians and expanded the Sankofa Strings sound into what was to become the Grammy winning [[Carolina Chocolate Drops]].

In 2007, Giddens contributed fiddle, banjo, "flat-footin'" dancing and additional vocals to [[Talitha MacKenzie|Talitha MacKenzie's]] album ''Indian Summer''.

Performing as a soprano, Giddens and mezzo-soprano Cheryse McLeod Lewis formed a duo called Eleganza to release a CD in 2009. ''Because I Knew You...'' consists of classical, religious, theater, and movie music. Giddens and Lewis were middle school classmates who reconnected after college while working in the same office. The friends started singing together in 2003, but did not begin recording until 2008.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pandolfi |first=Elizabeth |url=http://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/charleston/classical-duo-eleganza-mixes-it-up-musically/Content?oid=3612268 |title=Classical duo Eleganza mixes it up musically |newspaper=Charleston City Paper |access-date=2017-04-10}}</ref>
