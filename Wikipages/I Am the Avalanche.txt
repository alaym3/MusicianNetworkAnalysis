'''I Am the Avalanche''' is an American punk rock band from [[Brooklyn, New York]]. The group's name comes from a lyric written by Vinnie Caruana for a song which was later discarded. The phrase also appears in the poem ''"Oh, Immobility, Death's Vast Associate"'' by [[Stephen Dobyns]]; however, Caruana maintains that this is a coincidence, and that he was not aware of the poem until after naming the band.

== History ==
I Am the Avalanche was formed by vocalist [[Vinnie Caruana]] after the break-up of his previous band [[The Movielife]], and followed his short stint playing in [[Head Automatica]].<ref name=allmusic>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p740614/biography|pure_url=yes}} Biography], Allmusic.com</ref><ref>Brendan Manley, [http://google.com/search?q=cache:HxL9fVnxTJsJ:www.longislandpress.com/%3Fcp%3D145%26show%3Darticle%26a_id%3D5910+%22I+am+the+avalanche%22+review&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=50&gl=us Alive and Kicking]. ''[[Long Island Press]]'', September 29, 2005. Cached copy from Yahoo.com. Accessed July 3, 2007.</ref> The band also comprises drummer Brett "The Ratt" Romnes (who also produces the albums), and guitarist Brandon Swanson (former fill-in for [[Further Seems Forever]]),<ref name=allmusic/> guitarist Michael Ireland and Kellen Robson, the former bassist of Long Island band Scraps and Heart Attacks are also members. Aside from handling vocal duties, Caruana sometimes plays guitar on certain songs such as "This Is Dungeon Music," giving the band a three-guitar attack. He has also been seen playing guitar on "My Second Restraining Order." These are in line with the band's heavier, slower sound compared to the members' previous efforts.

The band toured the United Kingdom before they played America, playing 2 shows over the Halloween weekend in October 2004. Soon after this, on September 27, 2005, they released their self-titled debut album, produced by drummer Barrett Jones on [[Drive-Thru Records]]. The album received significant press coverage and mostly good reviews.<ref>Kim Owens, [http://www.kaffeinebuzz.com/musicreviews-iamtheavalanche.php Review]. Kaffeine Buzz.

The band played shows all over Australia in February 2009 as part of the annual [[Soundwave (Australian music festival)|Soundwave Festival]]. During their set on the Sydney leg, they played three demo tracks - "Winter Summer", "Brooklyn Dodgers" and "You've Got Spiders" (the latter two of which appeared on their second album Avalanche United) - and Vinnie Caruana also gave word of new album being released in the near future.

In 2009, Set Your Goals released the title track off their second studio album titled ''[[This Will Be the Death of Us]]'' through [[Myspace]], which featured Vinnie on vocals, furthering recent rumors that they were going to be doing a side-project together.

On March 6, 2011, I Am The Avalanche opened for [[Paramore]] during a concert in Puerto Rico, where they played several songs from their upcoming album. ''[[Avalanche United]]'' was then released on October 11, 2011, to incredibly positive reviews. In a review of the album, rock music magazine 'The 1st Five' acknowledged the long wait between the band's first and second records, and also the growth it had afforded them; ''"Yes, six years was a long time to wait for a new I Am The Avalanche record. But if they can make another leap like the one between their self-titled debut and Avalanche United I’ll wait as long as they like."''<ref>John-Michael Bond, [http://www.the1stfive.com/reviews/review-i-am-the-avalanche-avalanche-united Review]. The 1st Five Accessed Oct 14, 2011.</ref> I Am The Avalanche then played a stint on [[The Vans Warped Tour]] from June 16 - July 3, 2012, in support of the record, and also went on to play as part of that year's Soundwave Festival in Australia.

In September 2013, it was announced that I Am The Avalanche had entered The Barber Shop Studios to begin tracking their third full length, and on January 8, 2014, the band announced via their Facebook page that their third full-length album, titled ''Wolverines'', would be released on March 17 of that year on I Surrender Records. They wrote, 'WOLVERINES is an album that’s been a serious labor of love for us and one that we’re incredibly proud of. The Ratt, our super-talented drummer, produced the record and the great Will Yip mixed it.'. At the same time, they streamed the first single from the album, 'The Shape I'm In', on Esquire Magazine's website.
