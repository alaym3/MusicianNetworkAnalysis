==Artistry==

Amuro has a [[Mezzo-soprano]] vocal range. During the early stages of her singing career, she was noted for her limited vocal capabilities, and was criticized for constantly relying on production values to overlap these flaws. For example, her first two studio albums, ''[[Sweet 19 Blues]]'' and ''[[Concentration 20]]'', were examined by Ted Mills at [[AllMusic]], and labelled her voice very "limited" and occasionally sung "higher than she can manage".<ref name="allmusic1996">{{cite web|author=Mills, Ted|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/sweet-19-blues-mw0000920036|title=Namie Amuro – Sweet 19 Blues (album review)|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|date=July 22, 1996|access-date=June 20, 2017}}</ref><ref name="allmusic1997">{{cite web|author=Mills, Ted|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/concentration-20-mw0000914606|title=Namie Amuro – Concentration 20 (album review)|publisher=AllMusic|date=July 24, 1997|access-date=June 20, 2017}}</ref> By 2000, the [[English language]] started to heavily mix in with her music, starting with ''[[Genius 2000]]''. In several tracks, Amuro would record her vocals in Japanese (and additionally in English), whereas back-up vocalists would provide English translations and marry the two together.<ref name="genius2000"/> By ''[[Play (Namie Amuro album)|Play]]'', the singer would start to record tracks with less electronic synths and beats, particularly with the album track "[[Baby Don't Cry (Namie Amuro song)|Baby Don't Cry]]".

Throughout her career, Amuro has covered a wide range of musical styles and genres. Her music through the 1990s were influenced by [[eurobeat]] and the rise of [[J-pop]] music.<ref name="allmusic1996"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://artist.cdjournal.com/d/-/1195120551|title=Namie Amuro / Dance Tracks Vol. 1|work=CD Journal|access-date=June 20, 2017}}</ref> Additionally, she identifies [[Madonna]] and [[Janet Jackson]] as her inspirations, despite constant comparisons with sound and imagery by critics and publications alike.<ref name="8 things to know"/><ref name="allmusicbio">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/namie-amuro-mn0000362954/biography|title=Namie Amuro|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=October 4, 2017}}</ref> ''Sweet 19 Blues'' stuck with J-pop elements, but she began to experiment with Western genres such as [[R&B]], [[jungle music|jungle]], [[acid house]], [[house music|house]] and [[jazz music|jazz]].<ref name="allmusic1996"/> From ''Genius 2000'', she worked with American producer [[Dallas Austin]], resulting in a fully adapted [[hip hop music|hip hop]] record with elements of J-pop. She carried this sound on with ''[[Style (Namie Amuro album)|Style]]'' (2003), another record produced by Austin, and eventually onto ''[[Queen of Hip-Pop]]'' (2005).<ref name="allmusicbio"/> Amuro's transition from [[J-pop]] to "more mature, transatlantic" [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] was noted by critics, and the aforementioned title "Queen of Hip-Pop" was used by the [[Media of Japan|Japanese media]] to identify her (the term "Hip-Pop" is Amuro's combination of [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] and [[Pop music|pop]]).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=my4sBwAAQBAJ&q=Namie+Queen+of+Hip-Hop&pg=PA83|title=Rethinking the Humanities: Paths and Challenges|first1=Ricardo Gil|last1=Soeiro|first2=Sofia|last2=Tavares|date=15 November 2011|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443835558|via=Google Books}}</ref>

In 2007, Amuro released ''[[Play (Namie Amuro album)|Play]]'', which was highlighted as one of her key re-inventions of her entire career.<ref name="allmusic2007"/> Sonically, the record relied on R&B and hip hop elements, but started to involve contemporary [[dance-pop]] music. To an extent, Tills from AllMusic compared the effort to the works of [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[En Vogue]].<ref name="allmusic2007"/> ''Uncontrolled'' (2012) saw yet another transition with her sound, leaving R&B and focusing on [[electronic dance music]]. Additionally, this saw her first experimentation with full-length English language tracks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotexpress.co.jp/review/3586/|title=Uncontrolled / Namie Amuro|work=Hot Express|date=June 27, 2013|access-date=October 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004140058/http://www.hotexpress.co.jp/review/3586/|archive-date=October 4, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Unlike her previous records, ''Uncontrolled'' ventured into Western practitioners to helm the collection, including the likes of [[The Nervo Twins]], Henrik Nordenback, Christian Fast and [[Peter Mansson]].<ref name="Uncontrolled"/> This trend also moved onto her follow-up album ''Feel'', where she worked with artists such as [[Hook n Sling]], [[Dsign Music]] and [[Zedd]].<ref name="FEEL"/><ref name="feelreview"/> Her final studio album, ''Genic'' (2015), was her first record not handled by Japanese producers, and her second record to include almost all tracks entirely in English (after her 2013 album ''Feel'').<ref name="FEEL"/><ref name="Genic"/>

Ever since her debut, Amuro has been classified as one of Japan's most prominent and successful singers.<ref name="allmusicbio"/><ref name="hikaruutada">{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2016/09/25/music/hikaru-utada-iconic-women-japanese-pop-came/#.Wdq-6WiCzIU|title=Hikaru Utada and the iconic women of Japanese pop who came before her|work=The Japan Times|date=September 15, 2016|access-date=October 9, 2017}}</ref> In an opined article published by ''[[The Japan Times]]'', writer Ian Martin encompassed the singer alongside superlatives [[Yumi Matsutoya]], [[Utada Hikaru]], [[Seiko Matsuda]] and [[Hibari Misora]] as the leading female figures in Japanese music history. Although Martin identified Utada as one of the "only contemporaries" to break the Western society, he felt Amuro was her "most immediate predecessor," based solely on the fact that "[Amuro] represented a period when Japanese pop was learning to see itself as something that could stand alongside the Western music from which it took many cues."<ref name="hikaruutada"/> Additionally, Amuro's career has been constantly compared to the likes of Matsuda's, both whom grew up in the idol routine and having achieved commercial resilience ever since; music author Motti Regev regarded the musicians as part of the "golden age of J-Pop", before records declined due to the rise of the digital market in the mid-2000s.<ref>{{cite web|author=Grunebaum, Dan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/08/arts/08iht-Idols.html|title=As Japan Ages, Pop 'Idols' Aren't as Spry as They Used to Be|work=[[New York Times]]|date=October 7, 2010|access-date=October 9, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Regev, Motti|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=daIRAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT50|title=Pop-Rock Music: Aesthetic Cosmopolitanism in Late Modernity|date = 10 July 2013|publisher=Polity Press|isbn = 9780745670904|access-date=October 9, 2017}}</ref> Because of her longevity and the numerous musical and imagery re-inventions, numerous publications have referred her as the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Queen of Japanese Pop]]" and the Japanese equivalent to American singers [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Madonna]].<ref name="washington"/><ref name="Oahu"/>

Throughout her years active as a singer, Amuro has sold more than 36 million records in Japan according to [[Oricon]].<ref name="sales"/> According to a report by [[Entertainment Weekly]] announcing her retirement, she has sold more albums in Japan than [[Lady Gaga]], [[Katy Perry]] or [[Kesha]] have in the [[United States]] combined.<ref name="8 things to know"/> As of 2017, this makes her the fifth highest-selling female act, and fourth best-selling female solo act overall, just behind Yumi Matsutoya, Ayumi Hamasaki, [[Utada Hikaru]], and Japanese all-girl idol group [[AKB48]] ([[List of best-selling music artists in Japan|see total list here]]). Additionally, Amuro was ranked the 12th best-selling digital artist according to Japanese digital site Recochoku.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://recochoku.jp/special/100530/|title=Mobile Artist Ranking|publisher=Recochoku|access-date=October 9, 2017}}</ref> The singer has achieved nine number-one studio albums with an additional five compilation/collaborative inclusions, and 10 number-one singles.<ref name="oricon-positions"/> She is one of the only female solo artists to achieve the most accumulations of million-certified physical singles, with a total of five ("[[Chase the Chance]]", "[[Don't Wanna Cry]]", "[[You're My Sunshine]]", "[[A Walk in the Park]]" and "[[Can You Celebrate?]]" - [[Namie Amuro discography|see her discography for more]]).

With her sudden rise to stardom, Amuro was noted by journalists and commentators as a trendsetter to the Japan and across Asia.<ref name="allmusicbio"/> She eventually became the most prominent figure in fashion magazines and the general press for changing the typical [[Japanese idol]] image and styles of women in Japan, in favour of "dyeing their hair brown, plucking their eyebrows... thick-soled/long boots, a miniskirt, tanned-skin and tattoos". This made her a fashion icon, and created a phenomenon fan base known as Amuraa in the 1990s, with many young girls and women looked up to her fashion, hairstyle and makeup.<ref name="allmusicbio"/> Additionally, her fashions also paved the ways for a Japanese fashion culture, ''[[kogal]]'' , and fashion trends known as ''[[gyaru]]'',  a Japanese transliteration of gal.<ref name="allmusicbio"/><ref>{{Cite news|url= https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2018/09/5bff8871c4ea-japanese-pop-divas-fashion-legacy-lives-on-in-memory-youth.html|title = Japanese pop diva Namie Amuro's fashion legacy lives on in memory, youth |work =Kyodo News |access-date=September 12, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> However, David W. Edgington—writer of the novel ''Japan at the Millennium: Joining Past and Future''—opined that Amuro changed the stereotypical idol culture, whereas writer Marwan Kraidy believed she was part of "Japan's rising cultural power" towards the world.<ref>{{cite book|title=Japan at the Millennium: Joining Past and Future|year=2003|publisher=The University of British Columbia|isbn=9780774808996|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=El9Lj_EKzBAC&pg=PA156}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Kraidy, Marwan|title=Hybridity, Or the Cultural Logic of Globalization|year=2005|publisher=Temple University|isbn=9781592131457|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Ms7azOI8UgC&pg=PA169}}</ref> Furthermore, an author from the U.S.-Japan Women's Centre believed the success of ''Sweet 19 Blues'' was the reason many people emulated her as a [[role model]] between 1996 and 1997.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jānaru|first=Nichi-Bei Josei Jānaru|title=U.S.-Japan Women's Journal|year=2000|publisher=U.S.-Japan Women's Center}}</ref> Evidently, some commentators linked her sudden rise in success to the experiences of [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Madonna]].<ref name="washington"/><ref name="Oahu"/>
