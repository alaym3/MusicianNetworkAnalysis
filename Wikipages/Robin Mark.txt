'''Robin Mark''' (born 1957) is a Northern Irish Christian singer, songwriter, [[worship leader]], and recording artist based in [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland. Mark may be known best for "Days of Elijah", "Revival", "All for Jesus", "The Wonder of The Cross", and "Not by Might" amongst the many songs he has written and which are sung throughout the world. He has released thirteen albums in total, with sales of over two million worldwide, and has won the GMA's international award.

Though known within the United Kingdom and throughout Canada and Europe from the early 1990s, it was not until his 1999 live album ''Revival in Belfast'' that Mark became known well in the United States, Australia, and the rest of the world. His [[signature song]], "Days of Elijah", has proven popular since 1996.

Mark's album ''Revival in Belfast,'' released in 1999, remained high in both the Christian retail charts and ''Billboard'' charts for many years. It was still at No. 39 on the ''Billboard'' Top Christian Albums chart in 2004.<ref>"[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/robin-mark-p483275/charts-awards Charts & Awards]", [[AllMusic]]. Retrieved 24 July 2011</ref> When the follow up album, ''Come Heal This Land'', was released in 2001, it went straight to No. 1 in the Christian Retail Charts in the United States. Robin became the first artist from the UK to accomplish this feat.<ref>"[http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/news/Worship_Hit/30919/p1/]", [[crossrhythms]]. Retrieved 30 July 2011</ref>
