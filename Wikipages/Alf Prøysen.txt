'''Alf Prøysen''' (23 July 1914 – 23 November 1970) was a Norwegian [[author]], [[poet]], [[playwright]], [[songwriter]] and [[musician]].
Prøysen was one of the most important Norwegian cultural personalities in the second half of the twentieth century. He worked in several different media including books, newspapers and records. He also made significant contributions to music as well as to television and radio. He also wrote in the ''[[Arbeiderbladet]]'' from 1954 until his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oversetterleksikon.no/2018/05/31/alf-proysen-1914-1970/ |title=Alf Prøysen, 1914–1970 |publisher=Norsk Oversetterleksikon |author=Ove Røsbak |access-date=1 July 2019}}</ref>

He was also noted for his series of books featuring ''[[Mrs. Pepperpot]]'' (Norwegian: ''Teskjekjerringa''). The fictional character of a series of children's books established him as a children's author. The series of books were first published during 1956 and was first published in English in 1959.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://snl.no/Alf_Pr%C3%B8ysen |title=Alf Prøysen |publisher=Store norske leksikon |author=Erik Bjerck Hagen |access-date=1 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://barnboken.net/index.php/clr/article/view/190 |title=Teskedsgumman – en publikationshistoria på tre språk |publisher=Barnboken – Journal of Children's Literature Research.

==Background==
He was born Alf Olafsen at [[Rudshøgda]] in [[Ringsaker]] in [[Hedmark]] county, Norway. He was the son of Olaf Andreassen (1880–1959) and Julie Mathiasdatter (1879–1961). He was raised as the youngest of four children born to a rural farm family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.proysenhuset.no/alf-proeysen.470898.no.html |title=Alf Prøysen |publisher=proysenhuset.no |access-date=1 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.proysenhuset.no/det-nye-proeysenhuset.5722166-345813.html |title=Om huset Prøysenhuset |publisher=proysenhuset.no |access-date=1 November 2017}}</ref>

==Career==
Prøysen became an apprentice at the Norwegian School of Applied Sciences, where he was a copywriter and actor in the annual student reviews from 1942–45. He became associated with [[NRK]], making his recording debut in 1947. Prøysen soon became a national celebrity.	Through songs such as ''Husmannspolka'', ''Tango for to'', ''Lillebrors vise'', ''Du ska få en dag i mårå'', ''Julekveldsvis'', ''Jørgen Hattemaker'', ''Musevisa'' and ''Romjulsdrøm'' he became extremely popular through the 1950s and 1960s. Prøysen contributed to many artistic fields: children's radio, short stories, theater and music. Most of his stories and songs took place in an environment similar to the rural village where he grew up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nb.no/bibliografi/proysen/description;jsessionid=530505941B3720AACA23587BE92DF208.bibliografi7 |title=Alf Prøysen |publisher=Nasjonalbiblioteket |access-date=1 July 2019}}</ref>

In 1945 he debuted with ''Dørstokken heme'', a collection of short stories. His only novel ''Trost i taklampa'' (1950) was a success both as a book and as a play. He was frequently featured on radio and television programs during the 1950s and 1960s. Prøysen was awarded the Norwegian Cultural Council Honorary Prize (''Norsk kulturråds ærespris'') in 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://snl.no/Norsk_kulturr%C3%A5ds_%C3%A6respris |title=Norsk kulturråds ærespris |publisher=Store norske leksikon |access-date=1 November 2017}}</ref>

A large part of Prøysen's writing consisted of short stories. Much of his production was made for children. The first stories about ''Teskjekjerringa'' were published in the magazine ''Kooperatøren''. In 1956 the first book of a series about ''Teskedsgumman'' was published. From 1967, Swedish television featured a popular series. In the 1980s, a Japanese cartoon series for 130 episodes was made. Teskjekjerringa was published in the Penguin Books classic series becoming an international success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gyldendal.no/Forfattere/Proeysen-Alf |title=Alf Prøysen |publisher=Gyldendal Norsk Forlag AS |access-date=1 November 2017}}</ref>
