== Career ==

Fler was first recognized in the rap scene through collaborations with [[Bushido (rapper)|Bushido]]. Together, they released the collaborative album titled ''[[Carlo Cokxxx Nutten]]'' in October 2002. Fler had five feature parts on Bushido's first studio album, ''[[Vom Bordstein bis zur Skyline]]'', released July 2003.

Fler released his first solo album, ''[[Neue Deutsche Welle (album)|Neue Deutsche Welle]]'', on 1 May 2005. The first single was "NDW 2005", with a sample of [[Falco (musician)|Falco]]'s "[[Rock Me Amadeus]]".<ref>[[Michael Custodis]], ''Tadel verpflichtet.

====Attack on Fler====
On 27 September 2007 at 18:00, after co-hosting ''[[MTV]] [[Total Request Live|TRL]]: Urban show'', Fler was attacked by three unknown men armed with knives. One of his bodyguards was able to hold them off, while Fler left through the rear entrance. Nobody was harmed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.de/article/843374-aggro-berlin-fler-nach-angriff-bei-mtv-unverletzt.html |title=Top News - MTV |publisher=Mtv.de |access-date=28 November 2015}}</ref>

===2008–2010: Growth===
On 25 January 2008, Fler released his third solo album ''[[Fremd im eigenen Land (Fler album)|Fremd im eigenen Land]]''. The choice of the title was controversial due to a 1993 song of the same name by [[Advanced Chemistry]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Florence Feiereisen|author2=Alexandra Merley Hill|title=Germany in the Loud Twentieth Century: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-T22vJHaIKIC&pg=PA166|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-975939-2|pages=166–}}</ref>{{elucidate|date=November 2018}} There was also a 2007 album, ''Airmax Muzik''.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Fler had been in a quarrel with Bushido. After the [[Aggro Berlin]] recording label closed, he contacted Bushido and they officially showed their reconciliation with a photo shoot and interview for ''Bravo HipHop Special''.<ref>Bravo HipHop Special, July 2009</ref>
They created another collaborative album, ''[[Carlo Cokxxx Nutten&nbsp;2]]''. Its only single, "[[Eine Chance/Zu Gangsta]]", was released on 28&nbsp;August 2009 and reached No.&nbsp;26 in Germany and Austria.
The album was released on 11&nbsp;September and reached No.&nbsp;3 in the [[Media Control Charts]].<ref name="carlocokxxxnutten.de">{{cite web|url=http://www.carlocokxxxnutten.de/ |title=carlocokxxxnutten.de |publisher=carlocokxxxnutten.de |access-date=28 November 2015}}</ref> Bushido stated on the album's website that he "never believed" it would have such success considering the lack of promotion or digital release.<ref name="carlocokxxxnutten.de"/>

Fler's fifth studio album, ''[[Flersguterjunge]]'', was released in June 2010 through [[ersguterjunge]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/es/Fler-flersguterjunge/master/792054|title=Fler – flersguterjunge|website=Discogs}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/music/Fler/Flersguterjunge|title=Fler - Flersguterjunge|website=last.fm}}</ref>

==Influences==
Fler has cited several American rappers as his influences including [[Mobb Deep]], [[50 Cent]], [[Lunatic]] and [[Juelz Santana]].

== Feuds ==

===Eko Fresh===
In 2004, [[Eko Fresh]] released the [[Diss (music)|diss track]] "Die Abrechnung" ({{lang-en|The Reckoning}}), that mainly attacks [[Kool Savas]], but also referred to various German rappers, including [[Bushido (rapper)|Bushido]], [[Sido (rapper)|Sido]] and Fler.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laut.de/Eko-Fresh |title=Eko Fresh – laut.de – Band |publisher=Laut.de |access-date=28 November 2015}}</ref>

In December 2004, Fler responded with "Hollywoodtürke" ({{lang-en|Hollywood Turk}}), which mocked Eko Fresh as a "wanna be gangster" and also references the label [[Royal Bunker]] and rapper [[Bushido (rapper)|Bushido]].

Big Derill, Marcus Staiger and Boba Fettt of Royal Bunker responded with "Wer? Fler?" ({{lang-en|Fler who?}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalbunker.de/audio/ |title=ROYALBUNKER /audio |publisher=Royalbunker.de |access-date=28 November 2015}}</ref> and Eko Fresh with "FLERräter" (a wordplay on ''verräter'', meaning "traitor"), a track from his mixtape ''Fick noch immer deine Story'', that also features Bushido.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphop.de/magazin/news/detail/2005/01/10/bushido-und-eko-flerraeter/ |title=Bushido und Eko: Flerräter |date=10 January 2005 |publisher=Hiphop.de |access-date=28 November 2015}}</ref>
The feud continued as Fler and [[B-Tight]] dissed Eko Fresh on the track "Du Opfer" ({{lang-en|You victim}}).

Eko Fresh released a diss track titled "F.L.E.R." in 2006, rapping over the beat of his single "L.O.V.E.".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6zGcJrTusw |title=EGJ Eko Fresh - Diss gegen Fler F.L.E.R |publisher=YouTube |date=20 April 2008 |access-date=28 November 2015}}</ref> Fler responded on his 2007 mixtape ''Airmax Muzik'', mentioning Eko Fresh on some tracks. After that, both rappers kept quiet for some time. In 2011, Fler name-dropped Eko Fresh in his song "Autopsie", featured on the mixtape ''[[Airmax Muzik II]]''. Following that, Eko Fresh [[tweeted]] with irony to his fans, to buy Fler's album and called the song "whack".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hiphopholic.de/eko-fresh-macht-sich-uber-fler-lustig-bitte-kauft-euch-alle-airmax-muzik-ein-gutes-stuck-imagerap/ |title=Eko Fresh macht sich über Fler lustig: "Bitte kauft euch alle Airmax Muzik, ein gutes Stück Imagerap" |publisher=hiphopholic.de |access-date=28 November 2015}}</ref>

===Kollegah===
On 11 March 2009, the artists of label [[Selfmade Records]] released ''Chronik 2''. It features the track "Westdeutschlands Kings" by [[Kollegah]], [[Favorite (rapper)|Favorite]] and [[Farid Bang]], a diss track aimed at [[Sido (rapper)|Sido]], Fler and [[Kitty Kat]].<ref>[http://www.bassdraft.com/de/news/Aggro_Diss_Westdeutschlands_Kings/index.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707213450/http://www.bassdraft.com/de/news/Aggro_Diss_Westdeutschlands_Kings/index.html |date=7 July 2011 }}</ref>

On 20 March, Kollegah released "Fanpost", where he insulted Fler calling him a "fat potato" and mocked him claiming that he was penetrated with a carrot.<ref>[http://www.bassdraft.com/de/news/Kollegah_Fanpost_Fler_Diss/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707213801/http://www.bassdraft.com/de/news/Kollegah_Fanpost_Fler_Diss/ |date=7 July 2011 }}</ref>
Fler responded with the song titled "Schrei nach Liebe" ({{lang-en|Scream for love}}), which was based on [[Schrei nach Liebe|the song of the same name]] by [[Die Ärzte]].<ref>[http://www.bassdraft.com/de/news/Fler_Schrei_nach_Liebe_Kollegah_Diss/index.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707213812/http://www.bassdraft.com/de/news/Fler_Schrei_nach_Liebe_Kollegah_Diss/index.html |date=7 July 2011 }}</ref> After that, both rappers were quiet for nearly a year. In 2011, Fler name-dropped Kollegah in his song "Autopsie".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laut.de/Fler/Air-Max-Muzik-II-(Album) |title="Air Max Muzik II" von Fler – laut.de – Album |publisher=Laut.de |access-date=28 November 2015}}</ref>

In 2013, after the release of Kollegah and Farid Bang's collaboration album ''[[Jung, brutal, gutaussehend 2]]'', Fler released a track called "Mut zur Hässlichkeit" ({{lang-en|Courage to ugliness}}), in which he made fun of their image and also imitates them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://meinrap.de/2013/02/27/fler-mut-zur-hasslichkeit-jbg-audio/ |title=Fler - Mut zur Hässlichkeit (JBG) (Audio) |publisher=MeinRap.de |access-date=28 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228210340/http://meinrap.de/2013/02/27/fler-mut-zur-hasslichkeit-jbg-audio/ |archive-date=28 February 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== Business ventures ==
In March 2010, Fler opened his clothing store Psalm&nbsp;23, in Berlin-Wilmersdorf. The shop was later renamed Flerstore. In December 2011, the brick-and-mortar store was closed in favor of online sales for clothing and merchandise.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.hiphop.de/FrankWhiteNr.1/65633/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120707035919/http://blog.hiphop.de/FrankWhiteNr.1/65633/ |archive-date=7 July 2012 }}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=April 2014}} Since 2013, he has also established his own line of collections for his fashion brand, Maskulin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maskulin.de |title=Maskulin &#124; Der Streetwear Shop |publisher=Maskulin.de |access-date=28 November 2015}}</ref>
