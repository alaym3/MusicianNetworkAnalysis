==History==

===Formation, line-up changes and ''His Last Walk'' (2004–2007)===
{{main|His Last Walk}}
Blessthefall grew out of the high school practice sessions of rhythm guitarist Mike Frisby, lead guitarist Miles Bergsma, drummer [[Matt Traynor]], bassist and vocalist Jared Warth, keyboardist and vocalist Andrew Barr and later, vocalist [[Craig Mabbitt]]. Mabbitt's arrival resulted in Barr moving to strictly keyboards. Barr then departed in early 2005, with Warth picking up the keyboards when necessary. After founding member Miles Bergsma left to attend college at the [[Berklee College of Music]] in Boston, they released a three-track [[extended play|EP]] and newcomer Eric Lambert (Bergmas's replacement) became the lead guitarist to form their first solid line-up.<ref name="AllMusic bio">{{cite web|last=Mason |first=Stewart|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/blessthefall-p864094/biography |title=blessthefall |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=February 1, 2007 |access-date= February 11, 2015 |quote=A Christian-oriented screamo quintet with some hip-hop and nu metal influences, blessthefall started...}}</ref> Phoenix-area gigs with [[Greeley Estates]] and an openly religious orientation got the band local press and a deal with [[Warner Music|Warner]] subsidiary, Science Records.<ref name="evt">Ide, Chelsea.

===Mabbitt's departure and Bokan's induction (2007–2008)===
While on their first European tour (with [[Silverstein (band)|Silverstein]]) in late 2007, [[Craig Mabbitt]] left the band during the United Kingdom portion to spend more time with his daughter, whose childhood he felt he was missing out on. For the remainder of the tour, Jared Warth filled in for vocals while playing keyboards. When Mabbitt later attempted to return to Blessthefall, the band members decided not to let him back in, preferring to move on without him. On December 15, 2007, Blessthefall posted a blog on their MySpace page announcing their parting ways with Mabbitt, while Mabbitt posted a bulletin on his personal MySpace page stating his willingness to return to the band. Despite the departure, Mabbitt has remained great friends with the band.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Craig Mabbitt stated that the day after he finished recording his first album with [[Escape the Fate]], ''[[This War Is Ours]]'', he got a phone call from Blessthefall's management asking him to return to the band, but he refused.<ref name="AltPressPodcast">{{cite web|last=Press|first=Alternative|title=Podcast # 37|url=http://www.altpress.com/podcasts/entry/ap_podcast_37-guest_escape_the_fate/|work=Audio Podcast|publisher=Alternative Press|access-date=March 27, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825234348/http://www.altpress.com/podcasts/entry/ap_podcast_37-guest_escape_the_fate/|archive-date=August 25, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Mabbitt felt there was too much bad blood with their management. He also felt the band knew he had just finished a new album and that it was just bad timing, especially as he had begged to be back in for the previous eight months.<ref name="AltPressPodcast" />

The final song the band recorded and released with Mabbitt, called "I Wouldn't Quit If Everyone Quit", was released on the reissue of ''[[His Last Walk]]''. 

Shortly after this, on September 26, 2008, the band announced that they had made [[Beau Bokan]] the new lead singer and keyboardist. Bokan joined the band after leaving [[Take the Crown (band)|Take the Crown]], a group who released an EP and a full-length album but broke up due to the departures of James Campbell and Tony Gonzalez, lack of management, and financial burdens.<ref name="altpress1">{{cite web|title=Blessthefall announce Beau Bokan (ex-Take The Crown) as new vocalist, post song|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/archive_4781|publisher=Alternative Press|access-date=September 23, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012165832/http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/archive_4781|archive-date=October 12, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="TTC02">{{cite web|title=WE BROKE UP...read this|url=https://www.myspace.com/takethecrown/blog/435980948|publisher=Take the Crown|access-date=September 23, 2011}}</ref>
