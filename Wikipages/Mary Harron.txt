'''Mary Harron''' (born January 12, 1953)<ref name=caenc>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/mary-harron-profile|encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|title=Mary Harron|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190609144822/https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/mary-harron-profile|archive-date=June 9, 2019|author=Johnson, Brian D.|date=March 17, 2003}}</ref> is a Canadian [[filmmaker]] and [[screenwriter]], and former entertainment [[critic]]. She gained recognition for her role in writing and directing several [[independent film]]s, including ''[[I Shot Andy Warhol]]'' (1996), ''[[American Psycho (film)|American Psycho]]'' (2000), and ''[[The Notorious Bettie Page]]'' (2005). She co-wrote ''American Psycho'' and ''The Notorious Bettie Page'' with [[Guinevere Turner]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Bracebridge, Ontario]], Canada,<ref name=":33"/> Harron grew up with a family that was entrenched in the world of film and theater. She is the daughter of Gloria Fisher and [[Don Harron]], a Canadian actor, comedian, author, and director. Her parents divorced when she was six years old.<ref name=":13">{{Cite web|url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/films/article.jsp?content=33146.|title=Canadian Cool Meets American Psycho.|last=Johnson|first=Brian D.|date=April 10, 2000|website=Maclean's}}</ref> Harron spent her early life residing between Toronto and [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=caenc/> Harron's first stepmother, [[Virginia Leith]], was discovered by [[Stanley Kubrick]] and acted in his first film, ''[[Fear and Desire]]'' and was also featured in the 1962 cult classic ''[[The Brain That Wouldn't Die]]''. Leith's brief acting career partly inspired Harron's interest in making ''[[The Notorious Bettie Page]]''. Harron's stepfather is the novelist [[Stephen Vizinczey]] best known for his internationally successful book ''[[In Praise of Older Women (book)|In Praise of Older Women]]''. Harron's second stepmother is the Canadian singer [[Catherine McKinnon (actress)|Catherine McKinnon]]. Harron's sister, Kelley Harron, is an actor and producer.

Harron moved to England when she was thirteen and later attended [[St Anne's College, Oxford|St Anne's College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], where she received a Bachelors in English.<ref name=":13" /><ref>{{cite book | title=Michaelmas Term 1974 | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | series=Complete Alphabetical List of the Resident Members of the University of Oxford | year=1974 | page=137 }}</ref> While in England, she dated [[Tony Blair]], later the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], and [[Chris Huhne]], another Oxford student who later became a prominent politician.<ref name=Reuters2007-06-27/><ref name=theguardian2009-03-06/><ref name=independent2006-02-19/><ref name=oxfordstudent2015-05-10/><ref name=AVClub2017-12-08/> She then moved to [[New York City]] and was part of its 1970s [[Punk subculture|punk]] scene.

== Influences ==
During her adolescence, Harron was exposed to many different forms of art and film, and this is where she gained many of her influences. In her interview with ''The New School'', Harron states that she had many influences. “My parents took up to whatever films they wanted to see so I saw a lot of art films that would not be considered unsuitable for a child. She goes on to explain that her largest influences, especially as a child around the age of ten, were Alfred Hitchcock, Bergman, and Satyajit Ray. After she had moved to London in her teen years she began attending the National Film Theatre where she was exposed to other international filmmakers like Fritz Lang, Howard Hawks, Claude Chabrol, and Polanski. She was also exposed to noir films, namely ''Double Indemnity''. As she got older and became an adult, her taste for film changed as well. She stated she was inspired by the films ''Blue Velvet''. ''Drugstore Cowboy'', and ''The Piano'', directed by Jane Campion. While she said that she had plenty of exposure to Hollywood films, as most people do, she was enticed by these types of films because thy were, in her words, were “forerunners of independent film.”<ref>{{Cite web|last=York|first=The New School 66 West 12th Street New|last2=Ny 10011|date=2020-06-11|title=American Psycho Director Mary Harron Discusses her New School Residence and Film Career|url=https://blogs.newschool.edu/news/2020/06/american-psycho-director-mary-harron-discusses-her-new-school-residence-and-film-career/|access-date=2021-12-02|website=New School News|language=en-US}}</ref>  A scene that is reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock in ''American Psycho'' takes place in the staircase as Patrick Bateman is chasing the prostitute he named Christie with a chainsaw. The staircase symbolizes two of Hitchcock's films, both ''Vertigo'' and ''Psycho.'' It has aesthetic qualities that pertain to Hitchcock's style that definitely come through as an influence for Harron.

== Career ==

=== Early writing work ===
In New York, Harron helped start and write for ''[[Punk (magazine)|Punk]]'' magazine as a music journalist; she was the first journalist to interview [[the Sex Pistols]] for an American publication. She grew up in the early punk scene of America. She found the culture easy for her to fit into and was constantly evolving and spreading into new demographics.<ref name=":13"/> During the 1980s, she was a drama critic for ''[[The Observer]]'' in London for a time, as well as working as a music critic for ''[[The Guardian]]'' and the ''[[New Statesman]]''. In the late 1980s, Harron participated and began her film career writing and directing BBC Documentaries.<ref name=":13"/>

During the 1990s, Harron moved back to New York where she worked as a producer for PBS's ''Edge'', a program dedicated to exploring American pop culture. It was at this time that Harron became interested in the life of [[Valerie Solanas]], the woman who attempted to kill [[Andy Warhol]]. Harron suggested making a documentary about Solanas to her producers, who in turn encouraged her to develop the project into what would be her first feature film.<ref>Hurd, Mary. Women Directors and Their Films. Westport: Praeger Publishers, 2007. Print.</ref> Harron says she owes her success with her first film to Andy who helped to sell the controversial focus on the attempted murderess, Solanas.<ref name=":04"/>

===''I Shot Andy Warhol''===

Harron's feature film [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]], ''[[I Shot Andy Warhol]]'', released in 1996, is the partially imagined story of Valerie Solanas' failed assassination attempt on [[Andy Warhol]].{{sfn|Heller|2008|p=151}} She explains her interest in Solanas' life:

{{quote|For Solanas, there was this fierce, outsider quality to her unhappiness and frustration. That was a time in my life when I was frustrated myself in my work. I wanted to direct. I had the idea years before I got to direct myself. So I think there were elements of my own frustration and elements of what it was like growing up with an unfair attitude towards women&nbsp;... and Valerie was an extreme example of that. There was also the intellectual interest of how someone can be so brilliant and her life goes so wrong, and also, that she was so forgotten and misunderstood. In both cases, I felt like Valerie had been consigned to history as this lunatic, almost nothing written about her.<ref>Kaufman, Anthony (December 3, 2009). [http://www.indiewire.com/article/decade_mary_harron_on_american_psycho "Decade: Mary Harron on 'American Psycho'"]. ''[[indieWire]]''. Retrieved November 29, 2011.</ref>}}

It won the sole acting award at that year's [[Sundance Film Festival]] for [[Lili Taylor]]'s performance as Solanas.<ref>[https://ew.com/article/1996/02/09/1996-sundance-film-festival/ The 1996 Sundance Film Festival|EW.com]</ref>

===''American Psycho''===
Harron's second film, ''[[American Psycho (film)|American Psycho]]'', released in 2000, is based on the [[American Psycho|book of the same title]] by [[Bret Easton Ellis]], which is notorious for its graphic descriptions of torture and murder.<ref>[http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18522 The Perfect Billboard Erected for 'American Psycho']</ref> The protagonist, Patrick Bateman ([[Christian Bale]]), is an investment banker who goes on a killing spree. ''The New York Times''{{'}} Stephen Holden wrote of the film:

{{quote|From the opening credits, in which drops of blood are confused with red berry sauce drizzled on an exquisitely arranged plate of nouvelle cuisine, the movie establishes its insidious balance of humor and aestheticized gore.<ref>Holden, Stephen (April 14, 2000). [https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B05E6DC113EF937A25757C0A9669C8B63 "Film Review; Murderer! Fiend! (But Well Dressed)"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved November 29, 2011.</ref>}}

The film was mired in controversy before production began, due in large part to the legacy of the book's release.<ref name="LN">Marcus, Lydia. "The Pent Up and the Pinup." ''Lesbian News.'' April 2006: p. 43. Print.</ref> Harron has a liking for darker and more controversial topics, such as Valerie Solanas, but it was the satirical nature of the book that "inspired her film about perfunctory violence and obsessive consumption."<ref name=":22"/> As Harron began production, the crew had to contend with threats of protest, as the issue of violence in the media became crystallized by the [[Columbine shootings]]. Campaigns against the film continued throughout production, the [[Feminist Majority Foundation]] condemning the film as misogynist, and the Canadians Concerned About Violence in Entertainment (C-CAVE) convincing restaurant owners to deny Harron permission to film in their establishments.<ref name="NY">Harron, Mary. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/09/movies/film-the-risky-territory-of-american-psycho.html?pagewanted=2&src=pm The Risky Territory of 'American Psycho']". ''The New York Times'' 9 April 2000 late ed.: section 2. Print.</ref> When returning to work with Turner, Harron felt they were best suited for the job of ''American Psycho'' as they needed no hesitation on feminist values, especially after Turner's successful lesbian film ''Go Fish.''<ref name=":33">{{cite news|url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/the-monday-qa-mary-harron/article600379/|last=Punter|first=Jennie|date= September 5, 2011|access-date=May 19, 2019|title= The Monday Q&A: Mary Harron|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|location= Toronto|page= R3|archive-date=March 5, 2016|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160305005638/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/the-monday-qa-mary-harron/article600379/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Although some criticized ''[[American Psycho (film)|American Psycho]]'' for its violence against women, Harron and Turner made conscious decisions that project the female influence on this adaption. Harron's adaptation of this film changes the focus from purely Bateman's perspective to showcase the faces of the women as "the perspective in those murder scenes wasn't through Patrick Bateman but the women."<ref name="Bussmann2">Bussmann, Kate. "Cutting Edge". ''The Guardian''. March 5, 2009. p. 16. Print.</ref>

In the years following its release, the film has achieved [[Cult following|cult status]]; the controversy surrounding it, to some, gave way to an appreciation of the film's satirical qualities, while many others remain critical of its violence and depiction of 1980s decadence.<ref name="Bussmann2"/> Harron would later describe in an interview with [[BBC]], that ''American Psycho'' is a "period thing" that glimpsed at 1980s corporate capitalism, but from a distance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160317-why-american-psycho-has-never-been-more-relevant|title=Did American Psycho predict the future?|last=Barber|first=Nicholas|date=March 21, 2016|website=BBC Culture}}</ref>

===''The Notorious Bettie Page''===
''[[The Notorious Bettie Page]]'', released in 2005, starred [[Gretchen Mol]] as [[Bettie Page]], the 1950s pinup model who became a sexual icon. The film shows Page as the daughter of religious and conservative parents, as well as the fetish symbol who became a target of a Senate investigation of pornography. For this film, Harron did historical character research, and interviewed several of Page's friends as well as Page's first husband. Page was legally bound to another project and so unable to be interviewed. Harron saw Page as an unwitting feminist figure who represented a movement for women's sexual liberation, with some similarities to and differences from Solanas. About the film, Harron said in 2006:

{{quote|Clearly Bettie is a very inspiring figure to young women because she had a strong independent streak. She did what she wanted to do and she wasn't just doing it for men ... But I think it's a huge mistake to think of her as a conscious feminist heroine. As far as I can see, she didn't have an agenda, ever. She just followed her own path unconsciously. I don't think she thought of herself as a rebel in any way. She was kind of in her own world of dress-up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nerve.com/screeningroom/film/bettiepage/ |title=Bad Girls Go Everywhere: A Q&A with Mary Harron, director of ''The Notorious Bettie Page''|work=[[Nerve (website)|Nerve]]|date=April 14, 2006| access-date=November 29, 2011}}</ref>}}

Harron later stated that the film suffered from false expectations, in that many male critics and male viewers expected and wanted the film to be "sexy", but that the film instead portrayed "what it’s like to be Bettie", and Page herself did not get a "sexual charge" out of her modelling.<ref name="believer interview" />

===''The Moth Diaries''===

''[[The Moth Diaries (film)|The Moth Diaries]]'' (2011), Harron's fourth feature film, is another adaption of an American novel, being based on [[Rachel Klein (novelist)|Rachel Klein]]'s 2002 [[The Moth Diaries|novel of the same name]]. The film follows a group of girls living together at Brangwyn, a boarding school. A new student arrives, Ernessa ([[Lily Cole]]) and the girls begin to suspect that she is a vampire. Harron has described the film as a "gothic coming-of-age story"<ref>King, Randall. "The Notorious Mary Harron." Winnipeg Free Press. March 1, 2012. Print.</ref> that explores the nuanced friendships of teenage girls as they are repeatedly confronted with the prospect of adulthood. This Gothic horror feature entangles teenage experiences of sexuality, close female friendships, and drama with supernatural elements.

The film was shot in and around Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is a Canada-Ireland co-production as Harron worked with Irish production company Samson Films' David Collins.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/director-mary-harron-currently-behind-the-camera-for-the-big-screen-adaptation-of-the-moth-diaries-102524104.html|title=Director Mary Harron Currently Behind the Camera for the Big Screen Adaptation of THE MOTH DIARIES.|date=September 9, 2010|website=Canada NewsWire}}</ref>

===''Charlie Says''===
Harron directed the 2018 independent film ''[[Charlie Says (2018 film)|Charlie Says]]'', with a screenplay by Turner, which tells the real-life story of how three of [[Charles Manson]]'s female followers ([[Susan Atkins]], [[Patricia Krenwinkel]], and [[Leslie Van Houten]]) came to terms with the magnitude of their crimes while incarcerated in the 1970s. [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] played Manson in flashbacks. The film had initially been intended for another director, but when that director was no longer available Harron took over. Harron stated that she was fascinated by the psychological aspects of how the women ended up committing murder as a result of both manipulation by Manson and feelings of solidarity with one another.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/charlie-says-director-mary-harron-interview-1209251 |title='Charlie Says' Director Mary Harron Talks Depicting the "Tiny Choices" of the Manson Women |work=Hollywood Reporter |first=Abbey |last=White |date=May 13, 2019 }}</ref>

=== Other work ===
In addition to her films, Harron was also the executive producer of ''[[The Weather Underground (film)|The Weather Underground]]'', a documentary looking at the Weathermen (political activists and extremists of the 1970s). She has also worked in television, directing episodes of'' [[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]'', ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'', ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'', ''[[The L Word]]'' and ''[[Big Love]]''. Working on the episode of ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'' "The Rainbow of Her Reasons", Harron was brought back together with ''[[I Shot Andy Warhol]]'' actress, [[Lili Taylor]].<ref name=":04"/>

==Views==
Harron has been at times labelled a feminist filmmaker, in part due to her film on lesbian feminist [[Valerie Solanas]], ''I Shot Andy Warhol'', as well as a lesbian storyline within her 2011 teenage Gothic horror film ''[[The Moth Diaries (film)|The Moth Diaries]]'' (2011).<ref name=":04">{{Cite web|url=https://www.afterellen.com/tv/211980-mary-harron-is-a-feminist-queer-friendly-director-we-can-believe-in#Qc2RJgICbulyHrlf.99|title=Mary Harron is a Feminist, Queer-friendly Director We Can Believe In.|last=Bendix|first=Trish|date=March 24, 2014|website=After Ellen}}</ref> She has consistently denied this label, although she does consider herself a feminist. In a 2006 interview, she stated:

{{quote|I feel that without feminism, I wouldn't be doing this. So I feel very grateful. Without it, God knows what my life would be. I don't make feminist films in the sense that I don't make anything ideological. But I do find that women get my films better. Women and gay men. Maybe because they're less threatened by it, or they see what I'm trying to say better.<ref>Hornaday, Ann (April 16, 2006). "Women of Independent Miens: Nicole Holofcener and Mary Harron Prove a Woman's Place Is in the Director's Chair". ''[[Washington Post]]'', N01.</ref>}}

She is a member of [[Film Fatales]], a women's independent filmmaker collective.

Asked about her Canadian identity in a 2014 interview, Harron stated that she mostly felt "just not American." She stated that, to her, being Canadian meant "You don't think you're at the center of things." She also felt that, unlike American directors, she was not "a moralistic filmmaker. I’m not trying to tell people what to do, and I’m not trying to lead... I’m interested in ambiguity."<ref name="believer interview">{{cite web |title=An Interview with Mary Harron |url=https://believermag.com/an-interview-with-mary-harron/ |work=Believer Magazine |date=March 1, 2014 |first=Anisse |last=Gross}}</ref>

Although her films deal with controversial materials, like ''[[American Psycho (film)|American Psycho]],'' she does not put emphasis on gore and violence.<ref name=":22">{{Cite news|title=There's Something about Mary [Filmmaker Mary Harron has a Penchant for Controversial Material: American Psycho.]|last=Childerhose|first=Buffy|date=2000|work=Chatelaine|issue=5|volume=73|pages=40}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Harron lives in New York with her husband, filmmaker [[John C.

| quote       = But Tony Blair was not the only budding political leader Ms Harron - a flamboyant undergraduate who went on to direct American Psycho - dated as a carefree student. By remarkable coincidence, she also went out with Chris Huhne, an Oxford contemporary of Blair, who last week was tipped in the polls as the most likely contender to take over from Charles Kennedy as Liberal Democrat leader.

| quote       = Incidentally, one of those men was Tony Blair, who she went out with as an undergraduate; something which once again I can't reconcile with her wild child image, but Blair must have been more into his New York Dolls than New Labour while he was at St John's.
