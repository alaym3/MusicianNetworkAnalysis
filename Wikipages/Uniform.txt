A '''uniform''' is a variety of [[clothing]] worn by members of an [[organization]] while participating in that organization's activity. Modern uniforms are most often worn by [[armed forces]] and [[paramilitary]] organizations such as [[police]], [[emergency service]]s, [[security guard]]s, in some workplaces and [[school]]s and by inmates in [[prison]]s. In some countries, some other officials also wear uniforms in their duties; such is the case of the [[Public Health Service Commissioned Corps|Commissioned Corps]] of the [[United States Public Health Service]] or the [[France|French]] [[préfet|prefect]]s.  For some organizations, such as police, it may be illegal for non members to wear the uniform.

==Etymology==
From the Latin ''unus'', one, and ''forma'', form.<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Uniforms |volume=27 |page=582 |first=Charles Francis |last=Atkinson}}</ref>

==Corporate and work uniforms==

Workers sometimes wear uniforms or [[corporate]] clothing of one nature or another. Workers [[dress code | required to wear a uniform]] may include [[retail]] workers, [[bank]] and [[post-office]] workers, [[public security | public-security]] and [[health-care]] workers, [[blue-collar]] employees, [[personal trainer]]s in health clubs, [[Teacher| instructors]] in [[summer camp]]s, [[lifeguard]]s, [[janitor]]s, [[public transit | public-transit]] employees, [[towing]]- and [[truck]]-drivers, [[airline]] employees and holiday operators, and [[bar (establishment) |bar]], [[restaurant]] and [[hotel]] employees. The use of uniforms in commercial or public-service organizations often reflects an effort in [[brand]]ing and in developing a standard [[corporate image]]; it also has important effects{{which?|date=November 2021}} on the employees required to wear uniforms.
 
The term ''uniform'' may be misleading because employees are not always fully uniform in appearance and may not always wear attire provided by the organization, while still representing the organization in their attire. Academic work on organizational dress by Rafaeli & Pratt (1993) referred to uniformity (homogeneity) of dress as one dimension, and conspicuousness as a second.<ref>Rafaeli, A. & Pratt, M. J. 1993. "Tailored meaning: On the meaning and impact of organizational dress". ''Academy of Management Review'', 18(1): pp. 32-55.</ref> Employees all wearing black, for example, may appear conspicuous and thus represent the organization even though their attire is uniform only in the color of their clothing, not in its features. Pratt & Rafaeli, (1997) described struggles between employees and management about organizational dress as struggles about deeper meanings and identities that dress represents.<ref>Pratt, M. & Rafaeli, A. 1997. "Organizational dress as a symbol of multilayered social identities". ''Academy of Management Journal'', 40(4): pp. 862-898.</ref> And Pratt & Rafaeli (2001) described dress as one of the larger set of [[symbols and artifacts in organizations]] which coalesce into a communication [[Grammar (disambiguation) | grammar]].<ref>

'''Military uniform''' is the standardised [[dress]] worn by members of the [[armed forces]] and [[Paramilitary|paramilitaries]] of various nations. Military dress and military styles have gone through great changes over the centuries from colourful and elaborate to extremely [[Military camouflage|utilitarian]]. Military uniforms in the form of standardised and distinctive dress, intended for identification and display, are typically a sign of organised military forces equipped by a central authority.
The utilitarian necessities of [[war]] and economic frugality are now the dominant factors in uniform design. Most military forces, however, have developed several different uniform types.

Military personnel in most armed forces and some civilian officials may wear some or all of the following:

*[[combat uniform]]
*service dress
*[[dress uniform]]
*[[Full dress|full dress uniform]]
*[[mess dress]]

== Medical workers ==
Uniforms can distinguish various categories of staff in medical institutions: doctors, surgeons, nurses, ancillary staff and volunteers.

Note that traditional female [[nurse uniform | nurses' uniforms]] resemble uniforms ([[religious habit |habits]]) worn by [[religious order]]s.<ref>

==Educational==

Uniforms are required for students in many schools in different countries. School uniforms vary from a standard issue T-shirt to rigorous requirements for many items of formal wear at private schools. School uniforms are in place in many public schools as well.

Countries where mandatory school uniforms are common include [[Japanese school uniform|Japan]], [[Korean school uniform|South Korea]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Thailand]], [[India]], [[Australia]], [[UAE]], [[Singapore]], [[Albania]], [[Philippines]], some schools in [[Taiwan]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], [[Indonesia]] and the [[United Kingdom]], among many other places.  In some countries, uniform types vary from school to school, in the United Kingdom, many pupils between 11 and 16 of age wear a [[blazer]], [[necktie|tie]] and [[trousers]] for boys and [[blouse]], [[necktie|tie]] and [[trousers]], [[skirt]], or [[culottes]] for girls.  The ties tend to have a set pattern or a logo embroidered representing the school, and jackets will usually carry a badge on the breast pocket with the school's name, [[coat of arms]], and [[motto]] or [[emblem]]. Children in many British state primary schools will have a uniform jumper and/or polo shirt with the school name and logo.

Some universities in the [[School_uniforms_by_country#North_Korea|DPRK]] require students to wear uniforms.

==Diplomats==
{{main|Diplomatic uniform}}
From about 1800 to after the Second World War, diplomats from most countries (and often senior non-military officials generally) wore official uniforms at public occasions. Such uniforms are now retained by only a few diplomatic services, and are seldom worn.

==Police==

Members of the [[police]] in every country have a uniform for identification as [[Law enforcement|law-enforcement]] personnel or agents. They are distinguished from the public by the uniform the police wear during overt policing activity. Usually each country has its own different police uniform. 

Contrast [[plainclothes law enforcement]] and [[undercover operation]]s.

== Sports ==
{{See also|Sportswear (activewear)|Baseball uniform|Basketball uniform|Cricket whites|Kit (association football)|Uniform (American football)||Jersey (sport)}}
Most, if not all, [[sports]] [[sports team|teams]] also wear uniforms, made in the team's distinctive colors. In individual sports like tennis and golf, players may choose any clothing design allowed by the competition rules.

To prevent the confusion (for officials, players, and fans) that might result from two opposing teams wearing uniforms (kits) with similar colors, teams have different variations for "[[Home (sports)|home]]" and "[[Away colours|away]]" games, where typically one is dark and the other is light. In the four [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major North American sports leagues]], one of the two uniforms is almost always predominantly white, and each league except for the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) has a rule to determine which team should normally wear its white uniform. Customarily, [[National Football League]] (NFL) and [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) teams wear their ''color'' uniforms for home games. By contrast, [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) teams wear their ''white'' uniforms for home games. The NBA traditionally required home teams to wear white, or at least a light color, but as of the {{nbay|2017|app=season}} allows home teams to wear any uniform color, mandating only that away teams wear a color that sufficiently contrasts with the home team's choice.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Whitaker |first1=Lang |title=NBA, Nike unveil new uniforms for 2017-18 season |url=http://www.nba.com/article/2017/07/18/nba-nike-new-uniforms |website=NBA.com |access-date=October 15, 2018 |date=July 18, 2017}}</ref> These rules are not strictly enforced, however, for any of the four major professional sports leagues in North America. Some NFL teams, most notably the [[Dallas Cowboys]], prefer to wear their white jerseys for home games. When [[Joe Gibbs]] was the head coach of the [[Washington Redskins]] &mdash; first from 1981-1992, and again from 2004-2007 &mdash; the Redskins exclusively wore white jerseys at home games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-watch.com/research-projects/white-at-home-in-the-nfl|title=White at Home in the NFL|work=www.uni-watch.com|access-date=July 5, 2015}}</ref> In the [[United Kingdom]], especially in [[Association football|football]], the terms "kit" or "strip" (as in '[[football kit]]') are more common (instead of uniform).

{{See Also|Scouting#Uniform|Uniform and insignia of the Boy Scouts of America}}
The Scout uniform is a specific characteristic of the [[Scouting]] movement, in the words of [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell]] at the 1937 World Jamboree, "it covers the differences of country and race and make all feel that they are members one with another of one World Brotherhood". The original uniform, which has created a familiar image in the public eye, consisted of a khaki button-up [[shirt]], shorts and a broad-brimmed [[campaign hat]]. Baden-Powell himself wore shorts since being dressed like the youth contributed to reducing perceived "distance" between the adult and the young person. Nowadays, uniforms are frequently blue, orange, red, or green, and shorts are replaced by long pants in areas where the culture calls for modesty, and in winter weather. The campaign hats have also been dropped in some Scouting organisations.

==Buttons==

Some uniforms have specially-[[Manufacturing|manufactured]] buttons, which, in the case of [[antique]]s, often outlast the fabric components of the uniform, and become highly [[collectable]] items.<ref name="Button Country Uniform buttons page">{{cite web|url=http://buttoncountry.com/uniform.htm|title=Uniform (Division II)|last=Peach State Button Club|year=2010|work=Button Country|publisher=buttoncountry.com|access-date=11 March 2010|location=Georgia, USA}}</ref>  Nowadays, buttons come in different materials, shapes sizes and colors.

In some countries or regions such as the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Australia]] or [[Hong Kong]], the cost of cleaning one's uniform or work [[clothing]] can be partially deducted or rebated from the personal [[income tax]], if the organization for which the person works does not have a laundry department or an outsourced [[Industrial laundry|commercial laundry]].<ref name=se67240>{{cite web
