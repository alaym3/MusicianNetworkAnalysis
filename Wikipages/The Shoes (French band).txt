== History ==
On March 7, 2011, the band released their first album ''Crack My Bones'', on the independent French label Green United Music. The album includes ten original tracks, including nine in collaboration with French and international artists such as [[Esser (musician)|Esser]], [[Wave Machines]], Primary 1, Anthonin Ternant (from The Bewitched Hands) and Cock'n'Bull Kid.

At the same year, several of the songs on the album also resulted in the making of video clips: ''Cover Your Eyes'' (directed by We are from LA), ''Wastin' Time'' (directed by [[Yoann Lemoine]]) and ''Stay the Same'' (directed by Daniel Wolfe).
The Shoes performed at [[La Cigale]] during a sold-out concert on 9 November 2011. They were then among the ten finalists of the [[Prix Constantin|Constantin Prize]] in 2011 and won the 'Innovation Award' at the [[UK Music Video Awards]] 2011 with the clip ''Cover Your Eyes''.
The album ''Crack My Bones'' was placed in ninth place of the ranking of the "100 best albums of the year 2011" by the magazine [[Les Inrockuptibles]]
