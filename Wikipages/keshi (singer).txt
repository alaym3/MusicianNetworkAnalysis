Known for his distant falsetto vocals and textural instrumentals, he has accumulated over 700 million streams with songs such as ''like i need u'', ''2 Soon'' and ''right here''.<ref name="and he is a king:2">{{Cite web|title=Keshi|url=https://www.islandrecords.com/artists/keshi-0|date=2020-01-14|website=Island Records|language=en|access-date=2020-05-26}}</ref>

==Early life==

Keshi (Casey Luong) was born in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]], to [[Vietnamese Americans|Vietnamese]] parents and grew up in nearby [[Sugar Land, Texas|Sugar Land]]. Despite living in an ethnically diverse community with a large Asian population, he recalls that he often felt out of place and disconnected from his heritage while growing up, as others around him were mostly ethnically Chinese.<ref name=":vice"/> When he was 13, he began learning the guitar after picking it up from his grandfather. He began teaching himself the instrument while using his grandfather's Vietnamese music book. Another one of his motivations for learning guitar came from watching [[Drake Bell]] from the [[Nickelodeon]] TV show [[Drake & Josh]] attract girls through his guitar skills. In his early years playing guitar and writing music, he cites [[John Mayer]] and [[Ed Sheeran]] as his biggest influences.<ref>{{Cite web|title=keshi|url=https://genius.com/artists/Keshi|url-status=live|access-date=2021-04-03|website=Genius|language=en}}</ref> 

He graduated from [[Stephen F. Austin High School (Fort Bend County, Texas)|Stephen F. Austin High School]] in Sugar Land and earned a [[Bachelor of Science in Nursing]] from the [[University of Texas at Austin]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Guerra|first=Joey|date=2020-10-29|title=The journey of Houston's Keshi from TMC nurse to pop star|url=https://preview.houstonchronicle.com/music/houston-k-pop-star-keshi-is-making-it-on-his-own-15679000|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-07|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|language=en-US}}</ref> He then worked as an [[oncology]] nurse at the [[Texas Medical Center]] for two years.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wetmore |first1=Brendan |last2=Silvan |first2=Simone |title=Keshi Is the Internet's Triple Threat |url=https://www.papermag.com/keshi-interview-2640177450.html |website=PAPER Magazine |accessdate=7 November 2020 |language=en |date=3 September 2019}}</ref>

The name "Keshi" comes from the childhood name that his girlfriend's parents gave him. They have been childhood friends since 5th or 6th grade, and he would go over to her house everyday. When he visited, her parents would call him "Keshi," which they still do to this day. <ref>{{Cite web|last=Aben|first=Clarissa|date=2018-10-12|title=Interview: keshi|url=https://fromtheintercom.com/interview-keshi/|access-date=2021-11-25|website=From the Intercom|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Career==
During college, he created his moniker "Keshi", and began to share music via his [[SoundCloud]] page. He credited watching YouTube tutorials for teaching himself writing, producing, performing and engineering his music.<ref name=":0" /> Initially, he was in doubt of his abilities and musical direction, but slowly his distinct style, which relies on his dreamy vocals combined with lo-fi beats and guitar, garnered more attention and popularity.<ref name=":vice">{{Cite web|last=Liotta|first=Edoardo|date=2019-10-08|title=From Nursing To Lo-Fi Music: Keshi's Unusual Rise To Fame|url=https://www.vice.com/en_asia/article/ne8qdw/keshi-lo-fi-hip-hop-music|access-date=2020-06-09|website=Vice|language=en}}</ref> In 2017, he quit his job as a nurse and flew to [[New York City]] to sign with [[Island Records]]. His decision to quit nursing and the pursuit of music was ultimately made due to his realization that the fear of missed opportunities exceeded his fear of failure.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Tan<!--Tan is the family name-->|first=Mei Zi|title=Keshi's lo-fi EP 'bandaids' is laid-back soundtrack we all need during lockdown (VIDEO) {{!}} Malay Mail|url=https://www.malaymail.com/news/showbiz/2020/03/27/keshis-lo-fi-ep-bandaids-is-laid-back-soundtrack-we-all-need-during-lockdow/1850712|access-date=2020-06-09|newspaper=[[Malay Mail]]|language=en}}</ref> From there, his first singles attracted millions of listeners upon release.<ref name=":allmusic" /> 

He cites [[John Mayer]], [[Frank Ocean]], [[The 1975]], [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], and [[Bryson Tiller]] as some of his greatest musical influences.<ref name="and he is a king:2" />
