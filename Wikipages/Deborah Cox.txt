Born and raised in [[Toronto]], she began performing on television commercials at age 12, and entered various talent shows in her teenage years before becoming a professional backing vocalist for [[Celine Dion]]. In 1994, Cox relocated to the United States and was signed to [[Arista Records]] by [[Clive Davis]], releasing her [[Deborah Cox (album)|self-titled debut album]] the following year. Her second studio album, ''[[One Wish (Deborah Cox album)|One Wish]]'' (1998), was certified platinum in the United States. It was marked by the commercial success of the pop [[crossover (music)|crossover]] single "[[Nobody's Supposed to Be Here]]", which would become her most successful entry on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, peaking at number two and remaining there for eight consecutive weeks. Cox signed with [[J Records]] for her third studio album ''[[The Morning After (Deborah Cox album)|The Morning After]]'' (2002), which saw moderate commercial success.

Cox ventured into acting in the 2000s, making her film debut in the Canadian drama film ''[[Love Come Down (film)|Love Come Down]]'' (2000) and her stage debut in 2004, in the title role in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[Aida (musical)|Aida]]''. She has since appeared in smaller films and several musical productions, including the horror-drama ''[[Jekyll & Hyde (musical)|Jekyll & Hyde]]'', the biographical musical ''Josephine'' and the musical adaptation of ''[[The Bodyguard (musical)|The Bodyguard]]''. Cox's most recent studio albums, ''[[Destination Moon (album)|Destination Moon]]'' (2007) and ''[[The Promise (Deborah Cox album)|The Promise]]'' (2008), have been released through her own independent record label, Deco Recording Group.

==Career==
===1995–1999: Debut and ''One Wish''===
In 1995, label executive [[Clive Davis]] signed Cox to [[Arista Records]]. Featuring production from [[Dallas Austin]], [[Keith Crouch]], [[Tim & Bob]], and [[Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds]], she released her [[Deborah Cox (album)|self-titled debut album]] the same year. A middling commercial and critical success, the album peaked at number 102 on US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] but emerged as a steady seller, eventually receiving a gold certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), while going [[Music Canada|platinum in Canada]]. Lead single "[[Sentimental (Deborah Cox song)|Sentimental]]" entered the top five on the US [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]], while follow-up "[[Who Do U Love]]" attained worldwide success, becoming a top twenty success in Australia, New Zealand and the US, also reaching the top of ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Dance Club Songs]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IA8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA61 |title=Best-Selling Records of 1996 |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=BPI Communications Inc.|date=January 18, 1997 |access-date=May 8, 2015 |page=61 |issn=0006-2510|volume=109|number=3}}</ref> In 1996, ''Deborah Cox'' won Cox a [[Juno Award]] for [[Juno Award for R&B/Soul Recording of the Year|Best R&B/Soul Recording]] at the [[Juno Awards of 1996|annual award ceremony]] and earned her a Best Soul/R&B New Artist nomination at the [[American Music Awards of 1996|1996 American Music Awards]].

Cox contributed the non-album song "Things Just Ain't The Same" to the soundtrack to the 1997 film ''[[Money Talks (1997 film)|Money Talks]]''. A dance remix of the song, produced by [[Hex Hector]], became her second number-one hit on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Dance Club Songs chart and was included on her second album, 1998's ''[[One Wish (Deborah Cox album)|One Wish]]''. As with her self-titled debut album, her sophomore effort was once again executive-produced by Davis, but featured more uptempo, contemporary R&B, and a slew of new producers and personnel to incorporate dance and [[club music]], including [[Montell Jordan]], [[Shep Crawford|Anthony "Shep" Crawford]], [[Rodney Jerkins|Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins]], and [[DJ Quik]]. ''One Wish'' peaked at number 72 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and earned a [[RIAA certification|platinum]] certification from the RIAA, while reaching gold status in Canada. The album capitalized on the [[Crossover (music)|crossover]] success of lead single "[[Nobody's Supposed to Be Here]]" which became Cox's most successful entry on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number two, and remaining there for eight consecutive weeks, making it one of the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most weeks at number two (without hitting number one)|longest stays at number two in chart history]]. The song also reached number one on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]], spending a then record-breaking 14 weeks at number one, while the third single "[[We Can't Be Friends]]," a duet with [[R. L. Huggar]], reached the top ten, with "It's Over Now" and "I Never Knew" become chart-toppers on the [[Dance Club Songs]] chart.

===2000–2005: ''The Morning After'' and acting career===
After ''One Wish'', Cox collaborated with singer [[Whitney Houston]] on her single "[[Same Script, Different Cast]]" from the compilation album ''[[Whitney: The Greatest Hits]]''. Incorporating a backing track of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s "[[Für Elise]]" during the intro, it was released as a radio-only promo single and became a minor hit on [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number 70 while reaching number 14 on [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]]. In 2000, Cox made her acting debut when she starred in [[Clement Virgo]]'s Canadian drama film ''[[Love Come Down (film)|Love Come Down]]'', playing a [[nightclub singer]]. The film garnered eight nominations at the [[21st Genie Awards]], including two [[Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television Award for Best Achievement in Music – Original Song|Best Original Song]] nominations for Cox's songs "29" and "Our Love". In 2001, Cox then recorded "[[Absolutely Not]]", for the soundtrack to ''[[Dr. Dolittle 2]]'' which became her sixth number one hit on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Dance Club Songs]].

Cox's third album ''[[The Morning After (Deborah Cox album)|The Morning After]]'' was released in November 2002 on [[J Records]] following a frustratingly long departure from Arista. It marked the Cox's first record under [[Clive Davis]]'s label, with Davis, once more serving as executive producer.<ref name="billboard2002"/> Keen to build on the success of her previous album ''One Wish'', he enlisted the help of producers such as [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]], [[Jermaine Dupri]], [[Rodney Jerkins|Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins]], and [[Shep Crawford]] as well as up-and-coming producers [[Warryn Campbell]], [[Johntá Austin]] and [[Trackmasters|Alex Richbourg]] to work with Cox. A blend of urban R&B and adult contemporary songs with additional dance/house tracks, it became her highest-charting album on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] yet, debuting and peaking at number 38 and number seven, respectively. Commercially, the album was less successful than her previous album, however, though it produced two singles on the US [[Dance Club Songs]] chart, including "Mr. Lonely" and "Play Your Part".<ref name="billboard2002">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QA0EAAAAMBAJ&q=deborah+cOX+%22THE+MORNING+AFTER%22&pg=PA16|title=Cox Makes J Debut with 'The Morning After'|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=November 16, 2002|access-date=July 29, 2018}}</ref>

Also that year, her voice was featured in the movie ''[[Hotel Rwanda]]'' in the song "Nobody Cares". To sustain demand for Cox's club appearances, while focused on her family and new album projects, she released a dance single titled "House Is Not a Home" on [[Nervous Records (US)|Nervous Records]] in January 2006. Later in the year, her song "Definition of Love" was used in the movie ''[[Akeelah and the Bee]]'', but was not released as a single.

===2006–2009: ''Destination Moon'' and ''The Promise''===
Between 2005 and 2006 Deborah recorded her fourth album, called ''[[Destination Moon (album)|Destination Moon]]'', arranged and produced by [[Rob Mounsey]]. A tribute album to [[jazz]] singer [[Dinah Washington]], Cox noted it a [[concept album]] that she had in mind for years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deborahcox.com/ |title=The Official Deborah Cox Website |publisher=Deborah Cox |access-date=May 12, 2012}}</ref> Most of the album was recorded live with a forty-piece orchestra with Rob Mounsey arranging. Eventually released by [[Decca Records]] in June 2017, ''Destination Moon'' peaked at number three on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Top Jazz Albums. The same year, Cox co-starred alongside [[Golden Brooks]] and [[Darius McCrary]] in Leslie Small's film ''A Good Man is Hard to Find''. Based on the musical stage play of the same name, the comedy depicts the story of three women who each undergo romantic crises that challenge their personal and spiritual relationships.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10008746_good_man_is_hard_to_find?|title=A Good Man is Hard to Find (2007)|website=[[Rottentomatoes.com]]|access-date=July 29, 2018}}</ref> In 2008, Cox performed the [[O Canada|Canadian national anthem]] at the [[2008 NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star Game]] in [[New Orleans]], receiving rave reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxsports.com/southwest/story/top-10-nba-all-star-national-anthem-performances-020914|title=Top 10 NBA All-Star National Anthem Performances|website=FoxSports.com|access-date=July 29, 2018}}</ref> She also contributed the song "This Gift" to the soundtrack of the 2008 romantic drama film ''[[Meet the Browns (film)|Meet the Browns]]'', directed by [[Tyler Perry]], and served as a supporting act on [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s [[True Colors Tour 2008]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1046360/lauper-b-52s-anchoring-true-colors-tour|title=Lauper, B-52s Anchoring True Colors Tour|website=[[Billboard.com]]|access-date=July 29, 2018}}</ref>

Also that year, Cox finished work on her sixth studio album ''[[The Promise (Deborah Cox album)|The Promise]]'', released on November 11, 2008, through Deco Recording Group, Cox's own independent label, with distribution handled by [[Image Entertainment]]. A breakaway from her previous album, it marked her return to R&B music and saw her working with a wider number of songwriters and producers on the album, including The Avila Brothers, [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]], [[Devo Springsteen]], [[Sounds of Blackness|Big Jim]], and Shep Crawford.<ref name=linernotes>{{cite AV media notes|title=The Promise|others=Deborah Cox|year=2008|publisher=Deco, Image}}</ref>
