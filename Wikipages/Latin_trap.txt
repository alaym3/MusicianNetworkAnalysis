== History ==
=== 2000s ===
Latin trap originated in Puerto Rico and gained popularity throughout Latin America. The exact date of origin is unknown and has been widely debated. Puerto Rican reggaeton and Latin trap singer [[Ozuna (singer)|Ozuna]] states that it originated in 2007 with the song "El Pistolón", performed by [[Arcángel & De La Ghetto]], [[Yaga & Mackie]], and [[Jowell & Randy]] (the former two were duo at the time). [[De La Ghetto]] on the other hand, states that he has been performing Latin trap since around 2005 or 2006, and that people thought "he was crazy". Reggaeton artists at this time wanted to introduce elements of [[American hip hop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] to a Spanish audience.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/7933904/latin-trap-brief-history-ozuna-bad-bunny-de-la-ghetto|title=Ozuna, Bad Bunny, De La Ghetto, Farruko & Messiah Narrate a Brief History of Latin Trap|work=Billboard|access-date=April 16, 2018}}</ref>

=== 2010s ===
Latin trap began to gain prominence around 2014 when artists such as Alvaro Diaz, [[Myke Towers]] and Fuete Billete, the first Puerto Rican artists using early Latin trap beats to rap, began posting their songs through social media platforms. This new sound eventually gained popularity in Puerto Rico, and many Latin trap hits emerged, such as [[Bryant Myers]]'s "Esclava Remix", [[Lary Over]] and Brytiago's "Tú Me Enamoraste Remix", [[Farruko]]'s "Ella y Yo", and De La Ghetto's "La Ocasión", the latter to which Ozuna credits with expanding Latin trap internationally.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/us/kevin-fret-dead-puerto-rico.html|title=Kevin Fret, Openly Gay Latin Trap Artist, Is Shot and Killed in Puerto Rico|last=Zraick|first=Karen|date=January 10, 2019|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=January 10, 2019}}</ref>

==Criticism==
Latin trap's inability to be played on the radio stems from the profanity and lasciviousness of the lyrics.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bad-bunny-latin-trap-concert-tour-w517474|title=Bad Bunny: The Four-Billion-Stream Man Leading the Latin Trap Explosion|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=April 16, 2018}}</ref> The song "[[Cuatro Babys]]" by [[Maluma (singer)|Maluma]] has received much controversy over its lyrics as they arguably appear to suggest direct violence towards women.
