'''Fog Lake''' is the musical alias of Canadian singer-songwriter '''Aaron Powell'''. Powell began writing and recording songs in his hometown of [[Glovertown]], [[Newfoundland]]. In 2014, Powell moved from cassette label Birdtapes to become part of the [[New York City|New York]] based [[Orchid Tapes]], run by Warren Hildebrand. Powell's recordings have been described as "a complex collage of nebulous angst and heartfelt nostalgia".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wakethedeaf.co.uk/2015/07/14/fog-lake-victoria-park/|title=Fog Lake – Victoria Park|author=Liam Doyle|work=Wake The Deaf}}</ref> Fog Lake's latest full-length release entitled ''Tragedy Reel'' was released on April 23rd, 2021.

==History==
Powell began working on music during high-school years in [[Glovertown]], [[Newfoundland]]. The project began as ambient experiments, sampling and covers to "highly introspective, original recordings".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scarypretty.org/2013/08/03/interview-with-fog-lake/|title=INTERVIEW WITH FOG LAKE|work=SCARY PRETTY}}</ref> Powell's music is crafted in [[DIY]] format, on shoestring budgets.

Powell's first release was a compilation entitled ''There's a Spirit, There's a Soul'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://foglake.bandcamp.com/|title=Fog Lake – Bandcamp}}</ref> composed of pop/ambient songs recorded in high school. The project began to develop a following after the release of Fog Lake's first full-length album, ''Farther Reaches'', which was released independently in January 2013. Powell released the [[Extended play|EP]] ''Holy Cross'' in June 2013 via Birdtapes. Powell then followed up ''Farther Reaches'' with a second full-length record, [[Virgo Indigo]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyNjBy-mzn8/|title=Fog Lake – Virgo Indigo (Full Album) }}</ref> released  February 2014.
