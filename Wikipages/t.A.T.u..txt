'''t.A.T.u.''' ({{lang-ru|Тату}}, {{IPA-ru|tɐˈtu|pron|Tatu.ogg}}) was a Russian music duo that consisted of [[Lena Katina]] and [[Julia Volkova]]. The singers were part of children's music group [[Neposedy]] before being managed by producer and director [[Ivan Shapovalov]] and signing with Russian record label Neformat. t.A.T.u.'s debut album ''[[200 Po Vstrechnoy]]'' (2001) was a commercial success in [[Eastern Europe]], and that made the duo sign with [[Interscope Records]] to release its English-language counterpart, ''[[200 km/h in the Wrong Lane]]'' (2002). The album was certified platinum by the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry|IFPI]] for one million copies sold in Europe and became the first album by a foreign group to reach number one in Japan.{{efn|group=upper-alpha|Although ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' claimed t.A.T.u. as the first non-Japanese act to debut at number one in Japan,<ref>{{cite magazine|date=5 July 2003|title=Hitmakers with a Golden Touch|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3w0EAAAAMBAJ&q=t.a.t.u.+non-japanese&pg=PA52|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Nielsen Holdings|Nielsen Business Media, Inc.]]|volume=115|issue=27|page=52|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> South Korean singer [[BoA]] was the first artist overall to achieve such feat in 2002 with her debut Japanese album ''[[Listen to My Heart (BoA album)|Listen to my Heart]]''—the singer's second Japanese album ''[[Valenti (album)|Valenti]]'' also reached number one on its first week in 2003, one month before t.A.T.u.'s Japanese debut.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2009/03/20/music/no-constrictions-on-boas-ambitions/|first=Robert Michael|last=Poole|title=No constrictions on BoA's ambitions|work=[[The Japan Times]]|date=20 March 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190609020138/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2009/03/20/music/no-constrictions-on-boas-ambitions/|archive-date=9 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|date=15 February 2003|title=Hits of the World: Japan (Dempa Publications Inc.; 02/05/2003)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AQ8EAAAAMBAJ&q=japan+boa|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|volume=115|issue=7|page=40|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> According to [[Oricon]], t.A.T.u. became the first foreign group to reach number one with their self-titled Japanese debut album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oricon.co.jp/news/2096758/full/|title=【オリコン】BLACKPINK、アルバム初登場首位デビュー 海外歌手3組目|date=5 September 2017|language=ja|publisher=[[Oricon]]|access-date=28 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228032307/https://www.oricon.co.jp/news/2096758/full/|archive-date=28 February 2019}}</ref> The album had peaked at number three in its first week on the Oricon Albums Chart.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=22 March 2003|title=Hits of the World: Japan (Dempa Publications Inc.; 03/12/2003)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fw8EAAAAMBAJ&q=japan+200+km%2Fh|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|volume=115|issue=12|page=72|issn=0006-2510}}</ref>}} It was also certified gold in the United States and included the international hits "[[All the Things She Said]]" and "[[Not Gonna Get Us]]".

==History==

===1999–2001: Formation and ''200 Po Vstrechnoy''===
[[File:Tatu wordmark.svg|thumb|The wordmark logo of t.A.T.u.]]
Before production of t.A.T.u. began, the pair were in a group named [[Neposedi]]. Both [[Lena Katina]] and [[Julia Volkova]] were part of the band, along with members [[Sergey Lazarev]] and [[Vlad Topalov]]. Katina was also in a band named "Avenue" between 1994 and 1997.<ref name="askmen"/> It was reported that Volkova was banned from being in Neposedi, amid claims she was misbehaving and disrupting other members in the group, along with being accused of smoking, swearing and drinking.<ref name="askmen"/> However, Neposedi denied the claims and said that Volkova aged out of the group.

t.A.T.u. were formed in 1999 by [[Ivan Shapovalov]] and his friend/business partner Alexander Voitinskiy, who developed plans to create a musical project in Russia. With this idea in mind, Shapovalov and Voitinskiy organized auditions in Moscow in early 1999 for teenage female vocalists. By the end of auditioning, the partners narrowed their search down to ten girls, including the members that finally became t.A.T.u., Lena Katina and Julia Volkova. Lena and Julia knew each other before the auditions.<ref name="askmen">{{cite web |url=http://au.askmen.com/celebs/women/singer_150/170_tatu.html |title=T.A.T.U. - Askmen |publisher=Au.askmen.com |access-date=19 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617074837/http://au.askmen.com/celebs/women/singer_150/170_tatu.html |archive-date=17 June 2013 }}</ref>  Both girls stood out among the others because of their appearance and vocal experience, but the producers decided to start with 14-year-old Katina, who sang "[[It Must Have Been Love]]" by [[Roxette]]. Katina began recording demos, including "Yugoslavia", a protest song about [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sostav.ru/video/files/09yugoslavia.mp3 |title=Voitinsky about Yugoslavia |access-date=19 January 2013}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ok-magazine.ru/exclusive/item16832.php t. A. T. u.: «Мы и сейчас иногда целуемся!»] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021152116/http://www.ok-magazine.ru/exclusive/item16832.php |date=21 October 2014 }} // OK, № 20 (133), 2009</ref> After the demos were cut, Shapovalov insisted that another girl be added to the project. Thus, in late 1999, 14-year-old Julia Volkova was added to the group to complete the duo. She also started recording not long after Lena's "Yugoslavia" demo was finished.

According to Katina, Shapovalov was inspired to create the duo after the release of the Swedish film ''[[Show Me Love (film)|Show Me Love]]'' which focused on the romance between two school girls.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tatumedia.com/post/13311041014/lena-katinas-interview-in-story-caravan |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180211071905/http://tatumedia.com/post/13311041014/lena-katinas-interview-in-story-caravan |archive-date=11 February 2018 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> After completing the duo, the producers decided on the name "Тату" (Tatu). Sounding like the English word "[[tattoo]]", it is also a shortened version of the Russian phrase "'''Та'''  любит '''ту'''" (''ta lyubit tu''), meaning "This [girl] loves that [girl]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japantoday.com/jp/news/276939 |title=Japan Today: Japan News and Discussion |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121234841/http://www.japantoday.com/jp/news/276939 |archive-date=21 January 2008 }}</ref> For the release of their first English-language album, they decided to go by t.A.T.u., using uppercase letters and periods to distinguish themselves from an already existing Australian band, Tatu.

Over the next year, Katina and Volkova recorded songs with their producers. Voitinskij left the project, and Shapovalov decided to sign [[Elena Kiper]] as co-producer and co-writer for their debut album. They also enlisted the help of [[Trevor Horn]] to write the English-language version of "Ya Soshla s Uma". Trevor Horn went on to write t.A.T.u.'s most memorable song, "All the Things She Said", and helped produce most of the English album ''200 km/h In The Wrong Lane''. While working with Shapovalov, the group was "controlled" by him and it was reported that he was "strict" during the process of making the album.<ref name="askmen"/>

The first single was completed in autumn 2000, entitled "Ya Soshla S Uma" (later released in English as "[[All the Things She Said]]"). It was not physically and formally released until December 2000. The song describes the turmoil in a girl's soul because she is in love with another girl, but is afraid, as society frowns upon this. She asks her parents for forgiveness. Elena Kiper has been credited with the song, explaining that the idea came to her when she fell asleep at her dentist's office and had a dream in which she kissed another woman. She woke up saying out loud, "Я сошла с ума!" (Ya soshla s uma, meaning "I've lost my mind"). Ivan Shapovalov is said to have added the second phrase of the chorus, "Мне нужна она" (Mne nuzhna ona, meaning "I need her").

Their first album, ''[[200 Po Vstrechnoy]]'' was released on 21 May 2001. Their second single was "[[Nas Ne Dogonyat]]" which was only released in music video form rather than as an official CD single, although a promotional conjoined "Ya Soshla s Uma/Nas Ne Dagonyat" was released in [[Poland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/tATu-Ya-Soshla-S-Uma-Nas-Nie-Dogoniat/release/1798385 |title=TATU* – Nas Ne Dogonyat / Ya Soshla S Uma (CDr) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |access-date=19 January 2013}}</ref> This was followed by the third single "30 Minut", only available as a music video. The album was eventually released in [[Japan]], where it was certified gold by [[Recording Industry Association of Japan|RIAJ]]. The group went on tour in 2001, where their routines were described as "precise" and featured routines where the girls had to [[Striptease|strip]].<ref name="askmen"/> The tour appeared in countries including Germany, [[Bulgaria]], [[Slovakia]], the [[Czech Republic]], and [[Israel]].

===2002–2003: ''200 km/h in the Wrong Lane'' and Eurovision===
The English version of the album was released in December 2002 entitled ''[[200 km/h in the Wrong Lane]]''. The first single from the album was "[[All the Things She Said]]" which was released in October 2002. The song  peaked at the top spot in Australia, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The music video caused controversy worldwide, due to the members, who were both 17 at the time of the video's production, kissing behind a fence. Some believed the video promoted [[lesbian]]ism and [[pedophilia]]. Many musical journalists, publications and music critics had branded the group's music as "paedophilic pop".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2736367.stm |title=More to Tatu than shock tactics |date=14 February 2003 |work=[[BBC]] |access-date=30 January 2013 |first=Michael |last=Osborn}}</ref> The group announced their "Show Me Love Tour", which was to commence in the United Kingdom.

On 25 February 2003 the women mocked [[NBC]]'s insistence that they neither kiss nor comment on the Iraq war by performing "All the Things She Said" in white "T-shirts that bore the Russian language message [[Khuy Voyne!]] (Fuck the war!) across the front, and by blocking their faces with their hands as they kissed during a break in their performance."<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ivan Raykoff|author2=Robert Deam Tobin|title=A Song for Europe: Popular Music and Politics in the Eurovision Song Contest|date=2007|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|page=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=Eq7nilnv93cC&pg=PA111&lpg=PA111&dq=%22Jay+Leno%22++%22t.a.t.u.%22++kiss+censor&source=bl&ots=GE6GRUcNB-&sig=z_kkH5-Fg6ickdLq7TRm3pDZi14&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Mhx1U9z-FM3gsATcpIKgAw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22Jay%20Leno%22%20%20%22t.a.t.u.%22%20%20kiss%20censor&f=false 111]}}</ref>

The "Fuck the War!" T-shirts were banned on the ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' show and replaced with T-shirts that said "Censored". They still wrote the term on Jimmy Kimmel's hand.

The next single "[[Not Gonna Get Us]]" was released in May 2003. Though not as popular as their debut single, it managed to have success in most record charts. Also in May 2003, Shapovalov was arrested after arranging filming for the group's music video "[[Show Me Love (t.A.T.u. song)|Show Me Love]]" in Moscow's [[Red Square]] despite his application for filming being refused.{{cn|date=December 2019}} Shapovalov also attempted to film near London's [[Big Ben]] and various other locations.

In May 2003, t.A.T.u. represented Russia at [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003]], where they placed third. After the contest, Russia's Channel One complained that Irish broadcaster RTÉ (Ireland's national television broadcaster) had used a back-up jury, and that it had cost them victory; RTÉ did not use the televoting results after some network problems.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/may/30/russia.arts | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Vote switch 'stole Tatu's Eurovision win' | date=30 May 2003}}</ref> A statement by Channel One suggested that there were grounds to believe that the contest results could be much different for Russia. RTÉ responded by publishing the unused results of the Irish televote, which showed that had the jury not been used, Turkey, whose entry was also overlooked by the Irish Jury, would still have won. The group's record label, Universal Music Russia, were originally against the group's participation saying that the Eurovision contest was for "young artists" and said "artists of Tatu's level will not get much out of the participation in it, We [Universal] would much rather prefer the group to work on their new album, and not to participate in contests for rising stars [...]"<ref>[http://eng.tatysite.net/news/archive.php?id=755_0_5_0 Tatu's Recording Label is ::Against:: Their Participation in EuroVision!] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303183149/http://eng.tatysite.net/news/archive.php?id=755_0_5_0 |date=3 March 2016 }}.

===2004–2006: ''Dangerous and Moving'' and ''Lyudi Invalidy''===
On 26 September 2003, the group released a remix compilation, titled ''[[t.A.T.u. Remixes|Remixes]]''. In November 2003, the CD was released in Russia, with two new tracks and videos.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/tATu-Remixes/master/59727 |title=t.A.T.u. - Remixes |publisher=Discogs.com |access-date=19 January 2013}}</ref> The two new tracks were "Prostiye Dvizheniya" and "Ne Ver, Ne Boisya." Both of the tracks were released as singles, however "Prostye Dvizheniya" did not broadcast well in Russia, due to the promotion for "Ne Ver, Ne Boisya" in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. The DVD compilation ''[[Screaming for More (DVD)|Screaming for More]]'' was released on 24 November 2003, featuring music videos and behind-the-scenes. [[Anatomy of t.A.T.u.|''Anatomy of t. A. T. u.'']] aired on Russian television on 12 December 2003. The documentary revealed that the girls were not lesbians, and chronicled the group as they took part in Eurovision earlier in the year.

In early 2004, t.A.T.u. legally broke their contract with Ivan Shapovalov and Neformat. In the months before the split, t.A.T.u. and Shapovalov were being filmed for a reality show on [[STS (Russian television network)|STS]] in Russia titled ''[[Podnebesnaya]]''. The show followed the group as they were recording their second album, to little success, with their producer Ivan Shapovalov. The documentary aired on Russian television from January to March 2004.

There were many rumors around the split until the show aired, which depicted the group leaving due to a lack of interest and care from their producer. They also claimed the quality of the music being produced was too low, and that Shapovalov was only interested in creating scandals. Volkova stated, "He [Ivan] spends his time thinking up scandals instead of planning our artistic work. I'm sure our fans would rather hear new songs and new albums than new scandals." Katina then stated, "He made us out to BE lesbians when we were just singing FOR lesbians. We wanted people to understand them and not judge them. That they are as free as anyone else."<ref name=Ananova>{{cite web |author=Ananova Ltd |title=Tatu seeking new name and manager |publisher=ananova.com |year=2003 |url=http://www.ananova.com/entertainment/story/sm_864931.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061220092920/http://www.ananova.com/entertainment/story/sm_864931.html |archive-date=20 December 2006 }}</ref> In one of the final episodes, Volkova mentioned returning to the United States in spring of 2004 to record with new producers. However, she became pregnant soon thereafter, and recording was delayed.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news-article/tatu-singer-is-pregnant |title=Julia Volkova – Tatu Singer Is Pregnant |magazine=Contactmusic.com |date=16 May 2004 |access-date=19 January 2013}}</ref>

[[File:Gaudi arena.jpg|thumb|right|t.A.T.u. performing in October 2005]]

Volkova soon joined Katina and previous producer [[Sergio Galoyan]] in the studio. The group was backed by their record label, [[Universal Music International]], in finding adequate songs and production to release a new album. In August 2005, "[[All About Us (song)|All About Us]]" and "[[Lyudi Invalidy (song)|Lyudi Invalidy]]" were announced to be the first singles from the English and Russian albums, respectively. "All About Us" was a worldwide hit, charting in the top ten in the majority of European charts. The group released their second English album on 5 October 2005 titled ''[[Dangerous and Moving]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/tATu-Dangerous-And-Moving/master/31191 |title=Dangerous and Moving - t.A.T.u |publisher=Discogs.com |access-date=19 January 2013}}</ref> Its Russian counterpart was released on 19 October, titled ''[[Lyudi Invalidy]]''. The second single was "[[Friend or Foe (t.A.T.u song)|Friend or Foe]]". Soon after the video was released, the group's management replaced drummer Roman Ratej with Steve "Boomstick" Wilson, and appointed a new bassist, Domen Vajevec. On 25 March 2006, t.A.T.u. received the award for Best Group at the first edition of the ''[[TRL Awards]]''.

On 17 April 2006, t.A.T.u. returned to reality TV in Russia with ''t.A.T.u. Expedition'', which was broadcast on the Russian music channel Muz TV. It chronicled the release of their second album, and the recording of the video for their third single, "[[Gomenasai (t.A.T.u song)|Gomenasai]]", which was released during the airing of the show. The video, as well as the actual song, is quite a departure from t.A.T.u.'s usual style and leaves many of their fans cold.<ref>Alessandro Paolinelli, "t.A.T.u. story", CreateSpace Independent Publishing, 2014. {{ISBN|978-1497327382}}</ref> t.A.T.u. performed in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia on 28 April kicking off their Dangerous and Moving Tour. On 30 August 2006, the official website announced that the girls had left their record company, Universal/Interscope.

On 21 November 2006, the region of the [[Komi Republic]] in Russia filed a lawsuit against t.A.T.u. over the album and song "Lyudi Invalidy" due to the title translating to "disabled people". Leonid Vakuev, a human rights representative for the Komi Republic, interpreted the song as being directed towards disabled people and cited words written in the booklet for the album, which said: "[Lyudi Invalidy] do not know what it means to be a human being. They are fakes inside the human form. They do not live, but&nbsp;— function". Katina said, "Of course, we meant moral invalids, people who do not have [a] soul and human feelings." When asked if they had anything against disabled people, she stated that she finds it offensive to refer to people by that term, and added, "We take pictures together and make sure they have priority seats [at concerts]."<ref name=BBCRussia>{{cite web | author=Mornings On BBC

On 12 September 2007 the group released the concert DVD "[[Truth: Live in St. Petersburg|Truth]]". It was the group's first release since leaving Universal. In late 2007, "Белый Плащик", "Beliy Plaschik", the lead single from their upcoming Russian-language album, was released. The project was then known as "Управление Отбросами", "Upravleniye Otbrosami", which translates to "Waste Management". The second single, "220" ("Двести Двадцать", Dvesti Dvadtsat'), made its radio premiere in May 2008 and the music video was released on their official YouTube channel on 5 June 2008. "Beliy Plaschik" and "220" were the main attractions on a special release known as "[[Hyperion-Plate]]", the first-ever EP from the duo. The EP was released on 8 May 2008 and featured multimedia content including music, video, ringtones and wallpapers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/tATu-%D0%91%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8B%D0%B9-%D0%9F%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%89%D0%B8%D0%BA-White-Robe/master/199986 |title=t.A.T.u. - Белый Плащик / White Robe at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |access-date=19 January 2013}}</ref>

At the time of the "[[Hyperion-Plate]]" release, "Upravleniye Otbrosami / Управление отбросами" was scheduled to hit the stores in June 2008. The EP featured a poster which advertised that date, as well as a coupon redeemable for a discount on the album that expired on 30 June 2008. However, the release schedule abruptly stalled on 5 June 2008, when t.A.T.u.'s manager Boris Renski announced that Julia Volkova was seriously ill.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tatu.ru/en/news.html?id=653&page=4 |title=t.

On 9 September 2008, a press release appeared on the duo's official website that declared that the forthcoming album would be titled "Веселые Улыбки", "[[Vesyolye Ulybki]]" ("Happy Smiles") instead of "Upravleniye Otbrosami" ("Waste Management"). The name change reflected sarcastic comments about the state of the Russian music business made by Volkova and Katina in an interview with Moscow's Time Out Magazine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.tatu.ru/Media/2008/09/01/1220278500000.html |title=Там же одни проститутки! / It's full of whores! / Time Out Magazine / t.

On 12 September, the album's third single, "You and I" made its debut on Love Radio. The press release disappeared from the site shortly afterward, only to re-appear on 8 October with a change made to the cover art --- where there was once the face of a smiling astronaut on the original design, a black square now appeared.

On 15 October, t. A. T. u.'s website announced that "[[Vesyolye Ulybki]]" would be released on 21 October 2008, beginning with a special event at two Soyuz record stores in Moscow where fans could meet the girls and get their autographs. The album also went on pre-sale at the official t. A. T. u. web shop on 18 October, with a small number of buyers receiving a limited-edition postcard set as a prize. The songs were also made available internationally through the [[iTunes]] digital music store. Upon its release, it became apparent that the album essentially had two covers --- the astronaut cover was a slipcase, while the original design used for "Upravleniye Otbrosami" appeared inside. The black square from the press release had been hiding a [[Mars]] scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tatu.us/forum/viewtopic.php?t=18278&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=760&sid=4cb9858b2cefd521ba5d510631b7046f |title=Tatu :: View topic – New t.

Julia made headlines in Russia with an interview where she expressed her opinion on Lena's solo career, "She has the right to [sing t. A. T. u. songs], but it's so stupid, absolutely stupid.

===2011: Disbandment===
At the end of March 2011, t.A.T.u. management released a press release on their official website declaring t.A.T.u. over. Due to conflicts between the girls, and them both wanting to pursue solo careers, the duo was officially announced as disbanded. They finalised the duo's discography with a double remix album for ''Waste Management''. The management thanked fans for their loyalty over the past twelve years of the duo's history.<ref>[http://www.tatu.ru/en/ Official Press Release] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426022705/http://www.theprophetblog.net/t-a-t-u-s-lena-katina-tops-the-billboard-club-chart|date=15 April 2016 }} on tatu.ru</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/t-a-t-u/id429032922 |title=iTunes Store |publisher=itunes.apple.com |access-date=19 January 2013}}</ref>

After the split, the group decided to focus on their solo careers, both musically and in film. In August 2011, Lena revealed her debut solo single "[[Never Forget (Lena Katina song)|Never Forget]]" which eventually charted at number one on the US [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] for a sole week.<ref>[http://www.theprophetblog.net/t-a-t-u-s-lena-katina-tops-the-billboard-club-chart/ t.A.T.u.'s Lena Katina tops the Billboard Club Chart | The Prophet Blog] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814045050/http://www.theprophetblog.net/t-a-t-u-s-lena-katina-tops-the-billboard-club-chart/ |date=14 August 2016 }}.

===2012–present: Aftermath with Volkova and Katina arguments===
On 2 October 2012, Cherrytree Records/Universal Russia announced that they would be issuing a special re-release of t.A.T.u's ''200 km/h in the Wrong Lane.'' The "10th Year Anniversary Gold Edition" featured all new artwork, a never-before-released song from the 2002 sessions, "[[A Simple Motion]]", a brand new remix of "All the Things She Said" from producer Fernando Garibay, in addition to newly mastered songs. On 24 October 2012, Cherrytree Records released the official track listing for the album; it was a note addressed to fans handwritten and signed by Julia and Lena themselves. The album was released on 12 November 2012.

On 11 December 2012, Lena and Julia reunited to appear as musical guests on ''[[Vocea României (season 2)|The Voice of Romania]]''. It was their first performance together in three years. The duo t.A.T.u performed "All About Us" and "All the Things She Said" during the show. They also appeared in radio and on another television show before.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stirileprotv.ro/show-buzz/entertainment/rusoaicele-de-la-t-a-t-u-invitate-speciale-la-vocea-romaniei.html|title=Vocea Romaniei.

After the re-release, the group were interviewed by Bradley Stern on MuuMuse, and was asked about a reunion and relationship together. Volkova stated "We don't keep in touch", while Katina stated "Only when we see each other. We have very different lives in different countries now. We are not in a fight though."<ref name="muumuse">{{cite web |url=http://www.muumuse.com/2012/11/10-years-in-the-wrong-lane-an-interview-with-t-a-t-u.html/ |title= 10 years in the wrong lane: an interview with t.a.t.u.|last1=Stern |first1=Bradley |date=5 November 2012 |work=MuuMuse |access-date=10 January 2013}}</ref> As for a reunion, Katina said "I believe that there is always a chance for anything in this life. Maybe…." Volkova stated that, while she is not "ready for it", she said "But this won't stop us from reuniting for joint performances. We’ll see what happens!"<ref name="muumuse"/>

In April 2013, the group announced they would perform one live show at a Russian VIP Club. Lena also stated that "The t.A.T.u. comeback is very possible, we are talking about that right now." After Volkova had her second surgery for her ligaments, she officially confirmed that she and Katina were planning to reunite t.A.T.u.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vk.com/wall-8380?own=1 |title=T.A.T.U. &#124; Тату &#124; Tatu |publisher=Vk.com |access-date=16 November 2013}}</ref> However, soon Volkova told an interviewer that they were not reuniting after all. Katina also stated that her solo career was the number one goal at that time and if t.A.T.u. was going to reunite, it would only be for small things like commercials and concerts.

On 27 September 2013 t.A.T.u. performed a concert in Kiev, Ukraine. Shortly thereafter they wore their schoolgirls outfits from their first album again for a [[Snickers]] Japanese advertisement. Whilst in Japan they also performed "All the Things She Said" live in Tokyo.

On 17 February 2014, Katina posted a video message on her official YouTube channel stating that she would no longer be working with Julia and that t.A.T.u. was once again no longer a group.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zYvKwFQWvs|title=Обращение Лены Катиной к поклонникам (18.02.14)|date=17 February 2014|via=YouTube}}</ref> However, on 20 February, Volkova posted a video message saying that there is "no big reunion" but t.A.T.u. were having "joint projects".

On 6 April 2014, the music video to "Love in Every Moment" was released to the Cornetto Ru page on YouTube, in which Katina and Volkova filmed their scenes apart.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1csGuLoLsrQ|title=Юля Волкова & Лена Катина & Лигалайз & Майк Томпкинс - Любовь в каждом мгновении|date=6 April 2014|via=YouTube}}</ref> Towards the end of the video, Volkova is shown interacting with a body double of Katina, with the latter's face obscured.  The song is part of the "A Sight of Cupid" project which contains several short films about love. In the short film "Together Apart" the duo were portrayed as cupids. On 22 May 2014, both singers introduced the film at the Cannes Film Festival. Due to their conflict and in keeping with Katina's wishes to not interact with Volkova, both singers had separate interviews with reporters. Volkova announced during an interview with the Italian press that the film would be the last collaborative work between her and Katina.<ref>[

On 16 May 2016, the duo met publicly again at the 25th anniversary celebration of the children's musical group [[Neposedy]], which both were a part of before the formation of t.A.T.u. There, together with the children, Lena sang her song "All Around the World" and together with Julia, everybody sang "Nas Ne Dogonyat” ("Not Gonna Get Us").<ref>[http://neposedi.ru/2016/05/20/neposedy-s-razmahom-otmetili-svoyo-25-letie-v-luzhnikah/ «Непоседы» с размахом отметили своё 25-летие в Лужниках] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603235353/http://neposedi.ru/2016/05/20/neposedy-s-razmahom-otmetili-svoyo-25-letie-v-luzhnikah/ |date=3 June 2016 }}</ref>

On 7 August 2016, for the 15th anniversary of "Ya Soshla S Uma" being released, a remix video of "Ya Soshla S Uma" was uploaded to the official YouTube channel. The audio was a remix by Fly_Dream, and the video contained 'rare footage' of "Ya Soshla S Uma" in HD.

In October 2017, the official community of t.A.T.u. in [[VKontakte]] received a proposal to create a remix contest for rare a demo cappella, which was intended for the third studio album t.A.T.u. «Waste Management». During 2 months, different authors from around the world sent their works. On 13 August 2018 the video "НАВСЕГДА (Best Remixes) [AUDIO]" was uploaded to the official YouTube channel with 6 remixes: MZ Remix, Fly_Dream Remix, Alexander Davidov Remix, Niko Palonen Щели Remix, Niko Palonen Remix and Niko Palonen Remix instrumental.

t.A.T.u. was among hundreds of artists whose material was destroyed in the [[2008 Universal Studios fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=28 June 2019 |date=25 June 2019}}</ref>

On 8 June 2021, a lengthy interview and documentary about t.A.T.u.'s story titled "ТАТУ: 20 лет спустя! Главная российская группа в мире" was published on YouTube on journalist [[Ksenia Sobchak]]'s channel. The documentary discussed the formation of the group, its past controversies and Katina's and Volkova's personal and career developments after t.A.T.u. It also included interviews of former t.A.T.u. producer Ivan Shapovalov and Lena Katina's mother. Katina and Volkova were interviewed separately, as Katina rejected a common interview. The interview/documentary was the most trending video on Russian YouTube the day after it was published.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-lvHKc8_9k|title=ТАТУ: 20 лет спустя!

==Artistry and controversies==

===Public image===
Throughout their career the group has received criticism, particularly since the release of "All the Things She Said". The [[AllMusic]] review for ''200 km/h in the Wrong Lane'' labelled the band as an exceptionally tawdry gimmick.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://allmusic.com/album/200-kmh-in-the-wrong-lane-r608759 |title=200 KM/H in the Wrong Lane |author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |work=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=10 April 2012}}</ref> In 2003, after the release of their video of "All the Things She Said", some UK presenters campaigned to ban the video worldwide.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2718835.stm |title=Controversial duo top UK pop chart |author=BBC Music News |date=2 February 2003 |access-date=10 October 2012 |work=BBC News}}</ref> Despite subsequent reports that the [[BBC]] had banned the video from their pre-[[Watershed (broadcasting)|watershed]] programme ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', the BBC quickly denied the ban, stating only that they had better footage to show.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2723941.stm |title=BBC denies Tatu video ban |author=BBC Music News |date=4 February 2003 |access-date=10 October 2012 |work=BBC News}}</ref>

Just before the recording of their third studio album "Dangerous and Moving", it was announced that Julia was pregnant. This led to critics accusing the girls of being "fake", with regard to the impression they were lesbians, although Lena and Julia have said in the past they are not "together" or "in a relationship".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/06/14/1055220813616.html |title=Tatu bad to be true |date=14 June 2003 |work=[[The Age]] |access-date=10 April 2012 |location=Melbourne}}</ref>

===Cancellations of concerts controversy===
Between the years of 2002 and 2004, t.A.T.u. caused controversy for cancelling several concerts and tours around the world. In March 2003, the group announced dates for their "Show Me Love Promo Tour" in the United Kingdom. However the next month, just days before they were due to perform, the group dropped the dates and did not perform at the concert, due to poor ticket sales.<ref name="bbctickets"/> [[BBC News]] stated that only a fraction of the tickets were sold for the concert and said the stadiums (held in [[London]] and [[Manchester]]) had capacities of around 10,000.<ref name="bbctickets"/> A spokesman from their label, Interscope, did not understand why the cancellation took place.

In May 2003, t.A.T.u.'s management were sued by the promoters EEM Group for the cancellations of the concerts. EEM sued their management for £300,000, claiming they put "unachievable and numerous obstacles" in the way of ticket sales for the shows. They also claimed that Julia's illness was a reason for the cancellation, however due to the lack of evidence, the lawsuit was discarded.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/tatu/14181 |title=Tatu Sued! |date=1 May 2003 |work=[[NME]] |access-date=9 April 2012}}</ref> After the lawsuit, the group also cancelled their Asian promo tour for [[Japan]] and [[China]], due to Julia's sickness, with the excuse that Julia needed urgent surgery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eng.tatysite.net/news/archive.php?id=698_0_5_0 |title=TATU - News - The promo-tour in Japan has been cancelled |publisher=Eng.tatysite.net |date=18 April 2003 |access-date=16 November 2013}}</ref> The same month, the group postponed their German Promo tour, due to a late invitation to the 2003 [[MTV Movie Awards]], where they performed.<ref name="eng.tatysite.net"/> The following month they also cancelled their Riga concert and Japan concert in June, which led to a lawsuit from Pasadena Group Promotion, asking $180,000 in damages, as they did not receive any official letters regarding the cancellation.<ref>[http://eng.tatysite.net/news/archive.php?id=930_0_5_0 "Another lawsuit -- t.A.T.u. cancellations in Riga"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112183342/http://eng.tatysite.net/news/archive.php?id=930_0_5_0 |date=12 November 2013 }}.

While promoting their studio album ''[[Dangerous and Moving]]'', the group cancelled their appearances in Chile due to poor ticket sales and the withdrawal of one of the Chilean sponsors.<ref>[http://eng.tatysite.net/news/archive.php?id=2093_0_5_0 Tatu's visit in Chile is cancelled] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029193258/http://eng.tatysite.net/news/archive.php?id=2093_0_5_0 |date=29 October 2013 }}.

==Productions and T.A. Music==
When t.A.T.u. was first formed by Shapovalov, ''Neformat'' was created as the group's production company, with Shapovalov and Renski at the head. In 2004, the company was dissolved when t.A.T.u. left Shapovalov.

Since 2005, T.A. Music has been the Moscow-based production company of t.A.T.u. The liner notes that accompanied the release of ''[[Dangerous and Moving]]'' said that the company was composed of t.A.T.u., Boris Renski, Dasha Mischenko, and Andrey Artischev. After t.A.T.u. broke ties with Universal Music in 2006, it was announced in 2008 that T.A. Music would become the duo's record label, although only currently in the Russian market.  ''[[Vesyolye Ulybki]]'' was released internationally on iTunes through the T.A. Music label. T.A. Music also now acts as the label and management company for Lena Katina's solo project.
