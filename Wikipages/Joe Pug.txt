He has released two [[Extended play|EPs]], as well as the albums ''[[Messenger (Joe Pug Album)|Messenger]]'', ''[[The Great Despiser]]'', ''[[Windfall (Joe Pug Album)|Windfall]]'', ''The Flood in Color'', and ''The Diving Sun''.

While working as a carpenter in Chicago after dropping out of the [[University of North Carolina]], Pug wrote and recorded what would eventually become his debut EP, ''Nation of Heat.'' Its literate lyrics received widespread acclaim and Pug's unorthodox promotional strategy of distributing free CDs to anyone interested in sharing his music resulted in the EP selling over 20,000 copies. After touring with [[Steve Earle]] in 2009, Pug was signed by Nashville [[Independent music|indie]] label Lightning Rod Records and released ''Messenger'' in 2010.  After moving to [[Austin]], Pug released ''The Great Despiser'' in 2012.

Pug's acclaimed narrative songwriting has led critics to draw comparisons between his work and that of [[John Prine]]<ref name="AV Club">{{cite web|last=Murray|first=Noel|title=Joe Pug|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/joe-pug-72511|publisher=A.V.

== Background ==
Pug is originally from [[Greenbelt, Maryland]], where he lived in the [[Greenbelt Historic District|Old Greenbelt]] neighborhood.<ref name="Dear PG County">{{cite web|author=Leila|title=Dear Joe Pug: Let's keep it real.|url=http://dearpgcounty.tumblr.com/post/1315768633/dear-joe-pug-lets-keep-it-real|publisher=Dear PG County|accessdate=March 14, 2014}}</ref> He began performing music at a young age at Greenbelt's New Deal Cafe.<ref name="Greenbelt News Review">{{cite web|last=Peterson|first=Heather Elizabeth|title=NEW YEAR'S EVE 1997|url=http://duskpeterson.com/hometown/newsreview.htm|publisher=Greenbelt News Review|accessdate=March 14, 2014}}</ref>

Pug attended [[Eleanor Roosevelt High School (Greenbelt, Maryland)|Eleanor Roosevelt High School]]. While in high school, Pug, according to a ''Washingtonian'' interview, "played in cover bands and at New Year's Eve parties to make money" but "never seriously considered a career in music." One such band was Guys with Ties, an R&B and blues cover band which Pug co-founded and played saxophone for.<ref name="Guys with Ties">{{cite web|last=Boyes|first=Amy|title=Plans to help raise funds for Greenbelt's New Deal Café|url=http://ww2.gazette.net/gazette_archive/2001/200107/greenbelt/news/44279-1.html|publisher=The Gazette|accessdate=March 14, 2014}}</ref> He participated in the Roosevelt drama department, performing in [[Woody Allen]]'s "[[Don't Drink the Water (play)|Don't Drink the Water]]" among other plays.<ref name="Gazette 2">{{cite web|title=Drama department presents Woody Allen play|url=http://ww2.gazette.net/gazette_archive/1999/199947/greenbelt/news/a20864-1.html|publisher=The Gazette|accessdate=March 15, 2014}}</ref> He also performed improv comedy in his high school, a craft which he continued throughout his time at college.<ref name="Comedy Forums">{{cite web|url=http://forums.dsicomedytheater.com/showthread.php?t=88|publisher=DSI Comedy Forums|accessdate=March 15, 2014|title=GOLDEN MOMENTS: INSIDE IMPROV NOVEMBER 15th, 2003 |archive-date=March 15, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315053819/http://forums.dsicomedytheater.com/showthread.php?t=88}}</ref>

Pug graduated from high school in 2002 and enrolled at [[University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill]], where he studied playwriting.  Pug later told ''Kentucky.com'' that studying theater had helped his future music career:

{{blockquote|"Studying theater in college definitely helped in the performance aspect of what I do now. The creative part of it, where you're generating material and writing songs and then performing those songs... these are almost entirely different jobs. But theater definitely helped with the performance part."<ref name=Kentucky>{{cite web|last=Tunis|first=Walter|title=Joe Pug returns to Lexington, to play and then to record |url=http://www.kentucky.com/2014/02/20/3099171/joe-pug-returns-to-lexington-to.html|publisher=Kentucky.com|accessdate=16 April 2014}}</ref>}}

== Origins ==
In 2005
, on the night before his senior year fall classes were to start, Pug dropped out of college and drove directly to Chicago, having thought (as he mentioned later to ''[[The Daily Tar Heel]]''): "I had a moment where I realized life is short and I knew where I wanted to be and I should just get there."<ref name="Daily Tar Heel">{{cite web|last=Dixon|first=Alex|title=Joe Pug revives American folk|url=http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2012/06/joe_pug_revives_american_folk|publisher=The Daily Tar Heel|accessdate=March 17, 2014}}</ref> That week, he took a job as a carpenter and moved into an apartment in [[Logan Square, Chicago|Logan Square]]. Pug has described his two-day trip from [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]] in his [[Ford Ranger]] and his first week in Chicago as "the most magical experience of my entire life".<ref name="Otis Gibbs">{{cite news|last=Gibbs|first=Otis|title=Episode 58: Joe Pug|publisher=Thanks for Giving a Damn with Otis Gibbs}}</ref>

Pug soon began playing music again at open-mike nights at a local bar. When asked why he began pursuing [[folk music]] instead of other musical genres or the playwriting he studied at college, Pug responded:

{{blockquote|"It’s always been the music I’ve listened to most, though I’ve listened to different stuff along the way. I tried to write plays, but the reason it didn’t work is because I hadn’t seen or read enough plays. The albums I’ve listened to in the genre of American singer-songwriters hitting the road is innumerable. I feel really comfortable speaking that language."<ref name=Washingtonian>{{cite web|last=Scott|first=Erin Keane|title=Band Notes: Joe Pug|url=http://www.washingtonian.com/blogs/afterhours/music/band-notes-joe-pug.php|accessdate=17 March 2014}}</ref>}}

Developing on ideas and themes he was originally attempting to express in a play he was writing called "Austin Fish," Pug began writing the songs that would later become his first EP, ''[[Nation of Heat (Joe Pug EP)|Nation of Heat]]''.<ref name="Made Loud">{{cite web|last=Janetkjay|title=Joe Pug, "Messenger"|url=http://www.madeloud.com/articles/interviews/joe-pug-messenger|publisher=Made Loud|accessdate=March 17, 2014}}</ref> The songs were recorded at a local Chicago studio, where a friend snuck him in to record during late night slots that other musicians had cancelled. In 2009, after Pug self-released ''Nation of Heat'', he began shipping fans 2-song sampler CDs to pass along to their friends. The unconventional promotional strategy was a success, resulting in Pug sending out over 15,000 samplers and ''Nation of Heat'' selling over 20,000 copies. As Pug later recalled on his website:

{{blockquote|"People requested 2 copies, 5 copies, 10 copies, 20 copies. We’d send them all. We even covered the postage. Suddenly we’d be rolling into towns that we’d never been before and there would be crowds there who knew the songs. Our fans essentially became like a radio station for us, and they still are."<ref name=Bio>{{cite web|title=Bio|url=https://joepugmusic.com/bio/|publisher=JoePugMusic.com|accessdate=April 16, 2014}}</ref>}}

The EP was a critical success, drawing comparisons to the work of [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Josh Ritter]].  "Hymn #101," ''Nation of Heat'''s opening song, drew special attention, being spotlighted on [[National Public Radio|NPR]]'s ''Second Stage'' music blog.<ref name=NPR>{{cite web|last=Vallejos|first=Tamara|title=Joe Pug: 'Hymn #101'|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95798312|publisher=NPR Music|accessdate=April 12, 2014}}</ref>

After seeing Pug play as his opener, [[Rhett Miller]] passed Pug's music onto [[Steve Earle]], with whom he shared a manager.  Earle subsequently tapped Pug, at age 23, to open for his [[Townes Van Zandt]] tribute tour.<ref name="Otis Gibbs" /> Pug considers this his "first big break":

{{blockquote|"When Steve Earle released his Townes album, he tapped me to open his tour. It was a couple months in the U.S. and Europe. He was playing solo, so every night, there were only two people on stage. First me, then Steve. I was too young to be as terrified as I should have been. It was his endorsement that really made people take notice. Everyone needs that first hand up into the business, and Steve extended his to me. Grateful does not begin to describe the feelings I have for him. Since then, it’s been a slow and steady burn."<ref name="Austin Chronicle">{{cite news|last=Graham|first=William Harries|title=Music of the Mind: Joe Pug|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/music/2013-11-19/music-of-the-mind-joe-pug/|accessdate=16 April 2014|newspaper=The Austin Chronicle|date=November 19, 2013}}</ref>}}

As he toured the country in 2009 and 2010 in his 1995 [[Plymouth Voyager]], Pug became increasingly linked with the burgeoning indie-folk scene associated with bands such as [[The Low Anthem]], [[Langhorne Slim]], and [[Horse Feathers]].

In 2009, Pug released ''[[In the Meantime (Joe Pug EP)|In the Meantime]]'', an EP of songs that were recorded but not released on ''Nation of Heat''. This second EP was made available for free on Pug's website for anyone who joined his mailing list.<ref>http://www.hearya.com/2009/06/24/joe-pug-offers-free-ep-in-the-meantime//</ref>

== Lightning Rod Records and ''Messenger'' ==

The Earle tour and the crowds generated by ''Nation of Heat'' piqued the attention of Lightning Rod Records, the Nashville independent label behind [[folk music|folk]] and [[Americana music|Americana]] acts such as [[Jason Isbell]], [[James McMurtry]], [[Amanda Shires]], and [[High Cotton]]. In 2010, Lightning Rod signed Pug and released his debut full-length album, ''[[Messenger (Joe Pug Album)|Messenger]]''.<ref name="American Songwriter">{{cite web|last=Moss|first=Marissa R.|title=The Miseducation of Joe Pug|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/05/the-miseducation-of-joe-pug/|publisher=American Songwriter|accessdate=April 12, 2014}}</ref> On ''Messenger,'' a full backing band supplemented Pug's guitar, vocals and harmonica, a change featured most notably on an electric version of ''Nation of Heat'''s "Speak Plainly, Diana." Reviewers, like Steve Kolowich at the ''[[Washington City Paper]]'', noted that, with ''Messenger'', in contrast to ''Nation of Heat'', Pug turns from declarative and extroverted to reflective and introspective:

{{blockquote|"His lyrics are less declarative, and sometimes quake with doubt: 'Not So Sure' is a penitent ode to epistemology. 'Unsophisticated Heart' is an admission of immaturity that literally ends with a whimper. 'Disguised as Someone Else' is a fantasy in which the singer disavows his identity to hide from his regret. On the last record, Pug shouted, 'I have done wrong, I will do wrong, there’s nothing wrong with doing wrong!' Here, he seems to tack on a meek amendment: 'These days, I’m not so sure.'"<ref name="City Paper Review">{{cite web|last=Kolowich|first=Steve|title=Reviewed: Joe Pug's Messenger|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/38486/reviewed-joe-pugs-emmessengerem|publisher=Washington City Paper|accessdate=16 April 2014}}</ref>}}

The album met critical acclaim, with ''[[Paste Magazine]]'' rating it 9.1/10, adding: “unless your surname is [[Bob Dylan|Dylan]], [[Tom Waits|Waits]], [[Josh Ritter|Ritter]] or [[John Prine|Prine]], you could face-palm yourself to death trying to pen songs half as inspired as the 10 tracks on Joe Pug's debut full-length."<ref name="Paste Magazine" /> The success of ''Nation of Heat'' and ''Messenger'' led Pug to tours and performances with [[M. Ward]], [[Josh Ritter]] and [[Levon Helm]], as well as invitations to [[Lollapalooza]] and the [[Newport Folk Festival]]. In August 2010, Pug announced "The $10 Tour," an attempt by Pug to rein in ticket service fees for his shows. The tour was Pug's first headline tour with the Hundred Mile Band, his backing band consisting of Matt Schuessler on standup bass and Greg Tuohey on guitar.<ref name="$10 tour">{{cite web|last=Pug|first=Joe|title=The $10 Tour|url=http://joepugmusic.com/the-10-tour/|publisher=JoePugMusic.org|accessdate=April 16, 2014}}</ref>

== Austin and ''The Great Despiser'' ==

In 2011, Pug moved to [[Austin, Texas]], lured by the Texas songwriting tradition that produced the likes of, in Pug's listing, Steve Earle, [[Lucinda Williams]], [[Jimmie Dale Gilmore]],<ref name=Waco>{{cite web|last=Gilmore|first=Sara|title=Exclusive Interview: Joe Pug|url=http://wacoweekly.com/exclusive-interview-joe-pug/|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}</ref> [[David Halley]] and [[Billy Joe Shaver]]. Pug later described the move as follows:

{{blockquote|"Chicago is a very difficult place to leave, especially when it has supported my music to the level that it has. But I found myself enamored with the contributions that Texas has made to the American songbook and I had to go see where it was born."<ref name=Lightning>{{cite web|title=Joe Pug|url=http://www.lightningrodrecords.com/pug.html|publisher=Lightning Rod Records|accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref>}}

He frequently makes reference to the influence of Texas' songwriting legacy in interviews, telling KDHX "there's been a lot of songwriters I wasn't familiar with before I moved to Texas but now really think are influential in my writing."<ref name="Filled Up">{{cite web|last=Wheeler|first=Robin|title='I FEEL FILLED UP AGAIN' AN INTERVIEW WITH JOE PUG|url=http://kdhx.org/blog/2012/11/10/i-feel-filled-up-again-an-interview-with-joe-pug/|accessdate=April 17, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418234230/http://kdhx.org/blog/2012/11/10/i-feel-filled-up-again-an-interview-with-joe-pug/|archive-date=April 18, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> In his touring throughout 2011 and 2012, Pug began paying tribute to Austin musician Harvey "Tex" Thomas Young by playing "Deep Dark Wells," his cover of Thomas' "Start Again," which Thomas originally wrote as a poem to his jailed brother.

Pug toured with [[Strand of Oaks]] in April and May 2011. The two acts promoted the tour by releasing covers of each other's songs: Pug for Strand of Oaks' "End in Flames" and Strand of Oaks for Pug's "Hymn #101."<ref>http://www.hearya.com/2011/03/28/joe-pug-and-strand-of-oaks-cover-each-others-songs-announce-tour/</ref> Pug's April 29, 2011, performance during this tour at [[Lincoln Hall Chicago|Lincoln Hall]] in Chicago, Illinois was recorded live and released as ''[[Live at Lincoln Hall (Joe Pug Album)|Live at Lincoln Hall]]''.

As soon as ''Messenger'' was released, Pug immediately began writing the songs that would become his second full-length album. To help create thicker "arrangements that can stand shoulder to shoulder with the lyrics,"<ref name=Lightning /> Pug brought on producer Brian Deck, who he had known from his time in Chicago.<ref name=popmatters>{{cite web|last=Mistich|first=David|title=The Great Despiser Gets Inspired: An Interview with Joe Pug|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/161576-the-great-despiser-gets-inspired-an-interview-with-joe-pug/|publisher=PopMatters|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}</ref> ''[[The Great Despiser]]'' was released in April 2012.

''[[The A.V. Club]]'' described ''The Great Despiser'' as an album of literate regret, comparable to the work of [[John Prine]], [[Josh Ritter]], and [[Richard Buckner (musician)|Richard Buckner]]. The album's title track, "Hymn #76," which ''Paste Magazine'' described as "a fable of life and the reoccurring themes attached to growing older and moving on," is a continuation of the narrative in ''Nation of Heat'''s "Hymn #35" and "Hymn #101."<ref name=PasteBlanton>{{cite web|last=Blanton|first=Kristen|title=Joe Pug Talks The Great Despiser, Debuts New Track|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/av/2012/02/joe-pug-song-premieralbum-announcement.html|publisher=Paste Magazine|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}</ref>

== Break and ''Windfall'' ==
After a heavy touring schedule in 2013, Pug considered quitting music.  As he later told Denver's ''[[Westword]]'' that "hitting the road can make you go broke really quick" and that he "had expectations that were all out of whack."<ref name=Westword>{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Andy|title=Joe Pug on the Dangers of Expectation|url=http://www.westword.com/music/joe-pug-on-the-dangers-of-expectation-6626184|website=Westword|publisher=Westword|accessdate=May 1, 2015}}</ref> About the period, he wrote:
{{blockquote|"Everyone kept congratulating me on how well the tour was going, and the mood was probably the best it had ever been on the road. We finally got two hotel rooms in each city instead of one. We’ve got this incredible group of die-hard fans that somehow make each show bigger than our previous trip through town. Meanwhile my relationship was in shambles and creatively I was at a dead end.  There was absolutely no joy left in playing music.  So we walked off stage after a particular show when I played terribly, and pulled my manager aside in the green room and told him to cancel the rest of the tour dates and that I was essentially through."<ref name=Bio2015>{{cite web|last1=Pug|first1=Joe|title=Bio|url=http://joepugmusic.com/bio/|website=JoePugMusic.com|publisher=Lightning Rod Record|accessdate=1 May 2015|ref=Bio2015}}</ref>}}
However, in 2014, Pug took a break from touring, recommitting to, in his own words, "behaving like a human being again":
{{blockquote|"I needed to reconnect with my girlfriend. I needed to eat healthy food.  I needed to go enjoy live music as a fan. I really needed to make sure I still loved making music, because I really had my doubts at that point."}} He soon realized that he had the ability to give it all up, later telling ''[[American Songwriter]]'': "I don't feel like I would sacrifice everything for music. Life is bigger than that."<ref name=Songwriter2015>{{cite web|last1=Stephen|first1=Deusner|title=Joe Pug: The Big Picture|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2015/03/joe-pug-big-picture/|website=American Songwriter|date=March 10, 2015|publisher=American Songwriter|accessdate=May 1, 2015|ref=jo}}</ref> Coming out that turning point, he became engaged to fellow musician Jamie Zanelotti of The Hems<ref>{{cite web|last1=Corcoran|first1=Michael|title=As long as you're not finished: the Harvey "Tex Thomas" Young Story|url=http://www.artslabormagazine.com/as-long-as-youre-not-finished-the-harvey-young-story|website=Arts Labor Magazine|publisher=Arts Labor Magazine|accessdate=May 1, 2015|ref=YoungStory}}</ref> and began writing again, penning what would eventually become his next album.  Later that year, he began recording at producer Duane Lundy's Shangri-La Productions studio in Lexington, Kentucky, aiming to "capture the music just the way we play it, with minimal production."<ref name=Bio2015 /><ref name=LexGo>{{cite web|title=Critic's Pick: Joe Pug, 'Windfall'|url=http://www.kentucky.com/2015/03/30/3776441/critics-pick-joe-pug-windfall.html|website=LexGo|publisher=Kentucky.com|accessdate=May 1, 2015}}</ref>

This period of reflection and recommitment culminated in the 2015 release of ''[[Windfall (Joe Pug Album)|Windfall]]'', Pug's third album.  As a ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' review notes, the optimistic album "steps away from the more traditional Americana for a folk-soul hybrid that places greater emphasis on his vocals."<ref name=Paste2015>{{cite web|last1=Swedlund|first1=Eric|title=Joe Pug: Windfall Review|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/03/joe-pug-windfall-review.html|website=Paste Music|date=March 10, 2015|publisher=Paste Magazine|accessdate=May 1, 2015|ref=Paste2015}}</ref> The ''Lexington Herald-Leader'' praised the album's two-band approach as presenting an "elegiac, electric vitality" to the "unhurried solemnity" of the songs.<ref name=LexGo /> ''Windfall'''s hopeful final track &ndash; "If Still It Can't Be Found," which featured [[Wilco]]'s Pat Sansone on mellotron &ndash; received particular acclaim, with a ''Rolling Stone'' review noting that "it showcases the singer's unique and achingly honest point of view that spins lyrics into folk poetry."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=Marissa R.|title=Hear Joe Pug's Cathartic 'If Still It Can't Be Found,' Featuring Wilco's Pat Sansone|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/hear-joe-pugs-inspirational-if-still-it-cant-be-found-featuring-wilcos-pat-sansone-20141217|website=RSCountry|date=December 17, 2014|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=May 1, 2015}}</ref>

==Influences==
[[Image:Walt Whitman - Brady-Handy restored.png|left|125px|thumb|upright=1|[[Walt Whitman]], who Pug cites as "the biggest influence" for his first EP, ''[[Nation of Heat (Joe Pug EP)|Nation of Heat]]''.]] [[Image:Raymond Carver.jpg|right|125px|thumb|upright=1|[[Raymond Carver]], whose short stories influenced Pug's second album, ''[[The Great Despiser]]''.]]Pug's lyrics has been noted for their literary techniques and allusions. Pug admits to this influence, citing various novelists, short story writers and poets as inspirations.  John Steinbeck is referenced ''Messenger'''s "Not So Sure." Pug cited Walt Whitman as the biggest influence on ''Nation of Heat'', calling "Hymn #35" the "palest imitation of '[[Leaves of Grass]]' in recorded history!" He told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' that the biggest influence on ''The Great Despiser'' was short story writer Raymond Carver, praising him for how "when you return to a piece of his that you read long ago and realize just how much of your own detail was placed in the gaps."<ref name=Charley>{{cite web|last=Rogulewski|first=Charley|title=Joe Pug Brings New Tunes to SXSW|date=March 15, 2012|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/joe-pug-brings-new-tunes-to-sxsw-20120315|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}</ref> Pug has stated that he is attracted to "the narrative of the individual and the individual being the only thing you can be sure is real in yourself," which, he says, drew him to Walt Whitman and John Steinbeck when he was younger, and Raymond Carver and [[Cormac McCarthy]] as he has grown older.<ref name=popmatters />

Pug has cited John Hiatt as an influence on his melodic sense and narrative structures.<ref name=PasteKortya>{{cite web|last=Koryta|first=Michael|title=Catching Up With... Joe Pug|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2010/12/catching-up-with-joe-pug.html|publisher=Paste Magazine|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}</ref> He described the first John Prine record he received from his dad as a memorable moment in his development as a songwriter:

{{blockquote|"I’d never heard anything like that before. In a way, it was unfathomable to me that someone could write a song that would be as clear as a well-written book. I mean, I knew exactly what he was saying, immediately."}}
[[Image:Steve Earle 2.jpg|right|125px|thumb|upright=1|[[Steve Earle]], who Pug opened for in 2009.]]
Pug credits Steve Earle for teaching him "everything," calling his time touring with him a "master class" in performance. He later told ''PopMatters'':

{{blockquote|"For about a month in the states and a month overseas, it would just be me on stage by myself and then him on stage by himself—we’d be the only two people on stage. I was, like, I think, 23 at the time. So, luckily, I was too young and stupid at the time to know how daunting it was. (Laughs) If I had to do that now, I probably couldn’t get through it. I got to watch his show for ninety minutes or two hours every night. I took so much away from it, stuff that I still use on a daily basis. I’d go sell records after my set and as the lights would go down in the lobby I’d run backstage and pull up a chair next to his guitar tech and just watch the show from the side of the stage every night. I’d watch him as he sculpted the set, putting songs in different places. I’d watch him deal with everything from a seated, quiet Sunday night audience to a completely loud, drunk, standing audience somewhere in Scotland—I’d watch him deal with them as well. I got to see just about every scenario."<ref name=popmatters />}}

With ''Windfall'', Pug cites more contemporary influences, such as [[Josh Ritter]], [[Ryan Adams]], and [[M. Ward]].<ref name=Bio2015 /> However, Pug's trademark literary influences are still present: the chorus of "The Measure," which repeats, "all we’ve lost is nothing to what we’ve found" is inspired by a quote by [[Frederick Buechner]]'s novel ''[[Godric (novel)|Godric]]''. Of the reference, Pug explained:
{{blockquote|That was the original kernel for the song. It comes from a quote from Frederick Buechner's 'Godric,' which we've actually made the epigram for the album: "The secret that we share I cannot tell in full. But this much I will tell. What's lost is nothing to what's found, and all the death that ever was, set next to life, would scarcely fill a cup." I thought it was a beautiful phrase and tried to write a song that did justice to it.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McCartney|first1=Kelly|title=Song Premiere: Joe Pug, "The Measure"|url=http://www.folkalley.com/archives/001368.php|website=FolkAlley.com|publisher=FolkAlley.com|accessdate=1 May 2015}}</ref>}}
Throughout his career, Joe Pug has performed and recorded covers in tribute to his influences. He performed Harvey "Tex" Thomas Young's "You Can Go Crazy" on Young's ''More Than We Was'' album.  On ''Dead Man's Town: A Tribute to Born in the U.S.A.'', Pug performed [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s "Downbound Train", telling ''Esquire'': 
{{blockquote|"It is at once a testament to the timelessness of the Boss's songwriting and to the unchanged economic torpor of working people in America that this song is so relevant 30 years later. I was thrilled and honored that Lightning Rod Records gave me the opportunity to try to interpret one of my favorite songs from one of my favorite artists."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schrody|first1=Paul|title=Exclusive: Listen to Joe Pug's Gorgeous Cover of Bruce Springsteen|url=http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/music/news/a29708/joe-pug-bruce-springsteen/|website=Esquire|date=August 27, 2014|publisher=Esquire|accessdate=1 May 2015|ref=Esquire}}</ref>}}
