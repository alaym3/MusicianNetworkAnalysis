== Father Abraham ==
<!--- subeahders are unconventionally by the year of completion, because of their relative importance--->
In 1971, he created his well-known alter ego, Father Abraham, after writing a Dutch [[carnival]] song, "Father Abraham had seven sons".<ref>{{cite news|title=Pierre los van Abraham|newspaper=[[Het Parool]]|date=1973-11-30|via=[[Delpher]]|access-date=2021-11-26|url=https://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=ABCDDD:010838017:mpeg21:p019|first=Ben|last=Dull}}</ref> Initially he wore a fake beard, but subsequently grew a real beard which, along with a [[bowler hat]], became his trademark. Also in 1971, his duet with [[Wilma Landkroon]], ''"Zou het erg zijn, lieve opa"'' (Would it be bad, dear grandfather?), reached number one in the Dutch pop music charts.

In 1981 Kartner recorded a song about [[Weepul]]s, ''"Wij zijn de wuppies"'' (We are the Weepuls).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nieuws.nl/242167/Vader_Abraham_wil_meedelen_in_wuppiesucces|title=Vader Abraham wil meedelen in wuppiesucces|date=16 June 2006|work=Nieuws.nl|accessdate=15 December 2009|language=Dutch|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212065819/http://www.nieuws.nl/242167/Vader_Abraham_wil_meedelen_in_wuppiesucces|archivedate=12 February 2010}}</ref>

<!--- subeahders are unconventionally by the year of completion, because of their relative importance--->

{{Main|The Smurfs music}}
In May 1977, Kartner was asked to make a promotional song about [[The Smurfs]]. The record company initially only pressed 1,000 copies of the single, called "The Smurf Song", since they were unsure about the single's potential. However, they were all sold within one day at a [[Schlager]] festival.<ref>https://standbyproductions.nl/zangers/vader%20abraham.htm Biography from booking agency (in Dutch)</ref> After a repress, 400,000 singles were quickly sold. A full Smurfs album was then created, which sold 500,000 copies.<ref>"50 Jaar Nummer 1-Hits 1956-2006", Johan van Slooten, Becht Publishing, 2006</ref> The album was released in several dozen countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, and Sweden, and in various different languages. The album scored a number one hit in 16 countries. Subsequently, Kartner released other Smurf-themed albums, again in various countries and languages, such as ''Ga je mee naar Smurfenland'' (Dutch) and ''Vater Abraham im Land der Schlümpfe'' (German). In all, Kartner's Smurf works have sold around 17 million copies.<ref>https://www.ad.nl/show/vader-abraham-zei-eigenlijk-nee-tegen-smurfenlied~ae593920/ Dutch newspaper ''AD'', 23 October 2018</ref>

In 2005 Vader Arbaham recorded The Smurf Song together with the dance act Dyanmite.

=== Political songs, 1973-2016 ===
<!--- subeahders are unconventionally by the year of completion, because of their relative importance--->
As a reaction to the [[1973 oil crisis]], Kartner and the [[Conservatism|right-wing]] politician [[Hendrik Koekoek]] recorded the duet ''"Den Uyl is in den olie"'' (den Uyl is in the oil), blaming the [[Partij van de Arbeid|Social Democratic]] prime minister [[Joop den Uyl]] and Arabs for the crisis. In the carnival season of 1975, he published ''"Wat doen we met die Arabieren hier"'' (What do we do with the Arabs here?), containing the lines "What shall we do with the Arabs here?/They can't be trusted with our pretty women here.“ The record company has subsequently [[Deletion (music industry)|deleted the song]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/article/detail/3535606/2013/10/30/1972-Wat-doen-we-met-die-Arabieren.dhtml|title=1972 Wat doen we met die Arabieren?|last=van der Steen|first=Paul|language=Dutch|date=30 October 2013|access-date=4 February 2017}}</ref> His 1976 song, ''"Het leger der werklozen"'' (The army of unemployed) portrays the jobless as people who spend the day sitting in pubs, drinking alcohol. 

In 2002 Kartner recorded ''"Wimmetje gaat, Pimmetje komt"'' (Wim goes, Pim comes) with upcoming politician [[Pim Fortuyn]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.8weekly.nl/artikel/442/|title=Vader Abraham maakt partijlied Leefbaar Nederland|last=Bertens|first=Els|language=Dutch|date=31 January 2002|work=8 Weekly|access-date=15 December 2009}}</ref> predicting that Fortuyn may replace [[Wim Kok]] as prime-minister. Before this could happen, Fortuyn was assassinated. In 2012, he recorded ''"Beste Koning"'' (Dear King) and in 2016 ''"Ik wil mijn gulden terug"'' (I want the [[Dutch guilder|guilder]] back).
