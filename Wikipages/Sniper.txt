In addition to [[long range shooting|long-range]] and high-grade marksmanship, military snipers are trained in a variety of [[special operation]] techniques: detection, stalking, target range estimation methods, [[Military camouflage|camouflage]], [[field craft]], [[infiltration tactics|infiltration]], [[special reconnaissance]] and [[observation]], [[surveillance]] and [[target acquisition]].

==Etymology==
The name "sniper" comes from the verb "to snipe", which originated in the 1770s among soldiers in [[presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]] in reference to shooting [[snipe]]s,<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Pegler|first=Martin|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56654780|title=Out of nowhere : a history of the military sniper|date=2004|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=1-84176-854-5|location=Oxford|pages=16|oclc=56654780}}</ref><ref name="etymology">{{cite web|title=Snipe|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=snipe|access-date=8 April 2019|work=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref> a [[wader]] that was considered an extremely challenging [[game (hunting)|game bird]] for [[hunter]]s due to its alertness, camouflaging color and erratic flight behavior. Snipe hunters therefore needed to be stealthy in addition to being good trackers and marksmen.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="etymology" /> In the 18th century, letters sent home by English officers in India referred to a day's rough shooting as "going sniping",<ref name=":0" /> as it took a skilled [[flintlock]] sportsman a lot of patience and endurance to wing-shoot a snipe in flight.<ref name=":0" /> Accomplishing such an shot was regarded as exceptional, and inevitably during the late 18th century, the term "snipe shooting" was simplified to "sniping". This evolved to the [[agent noun]] "sniper", first appearing by the 1820s.<ref name="etymology" /> The term "sniper" was first attested militarily in 1824,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://army.ca/wiki/index.php/Sniper|title=Sniper – Army.ca Wiki|website=army.ca|access-date=17 October 2018|archive-date=2 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702044244/http://army.ca/wiki/index.php/Sniper|url-status=dead}}</ref> becoming common place in the [[First World War]].<ref name=":0" />

The older term "[[sharpshooter]]" comes from the [[calque]] of German word ''Scharfschütze'', in use by British newspapers as early as 1801.<ref name="etymology" /><ref>In the ''Edinburgh Advertiser'', 23 June 1801, can be found the following quote in a piece about the North British Militia; ''"This Regiment has several Field Pieces, and two companies of Sharp Shooters, which are very necessary in the modern Stile of War"''.</ref> The word alludes to good marksmanship, itself descendent of the [[shooting sport|shooting competitions]] (''Schützenfeste'')<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Pegler|first=Martin|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56654780|title=Out of nowhere : a history of the military sniper|date=2004|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=1-84176-854-5|location=Oxford|pages=30|oclc=56654780}}</ref> that took place throughout the year in [[Munich]] in the 15th century.<ref name=":1" /> Small companies of shooters (''Schützenfähnlein'')<ref name=":1" /> from the [[German states]] and [[Swiss cantons]] would form teams of ''Scharfschützen''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pegler|first=Martin|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56654780|title=Out of nowhere : a history of the military sniper|date=2004|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=1-84176-854-5|location=Oxford|pages=14|oclc=56654780}}</ref> for such popular competitions; proudly carrying flags depicting a [[crossbow]] on one side and a target [[musket]] on the other.<ref name=":1" /> The earliest known date for the creation of a shooting club formed specifically for the use of firearms comes from [[Lucerne]], [[Switzerland]], where one club has a charter dating from 1466.<ref name=":1" /> During the [[American Civil War]], [[Confederate Army|Confederate]] marksmen equipped with the imported [[Whitworth rifle]]s were famously known as the [[Whitworth Sharpshooters]].

Snipers are also called "hunters" in many languages, due to the nature of the craft (with the hunting horn also being a symbol of marksmanship), being called ''Caçadores'', ''Chasseurs'' and ''Jägers''. Other words for sniper include ''franc-tiréur'', ''tiréur d'élite'' and ''atirador de escol''.

===Military doctrine===
Different countries use different [[military doctrine]]s regarding snipers in [[military unit]]s, settings, and [[military tactics|tactics]].

Generally, a sniper's primary function in modern warfare is to provide detailed [[surveillance]] from a concealed position and, if necessary, to reduce the enemy's combat ability by neutralizing high-value targets (especially [[officer (armed forces)|officers]] and other [[VIP|key personnel]]) and in the process [[suppression fire|pinning down]] and [[demoralization (warfare)|demoralizing the enemy]].<ref name="Plaster p. ">{{harvnb|Plaster|2007|p=}}</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}<ref name="Plaster 1993 p. ">{{harvnb|Plaster|1993|p=}}</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2018}} Typical sniper missions include managing [[military intelligence|intelligence]] information they gather during [[reconnaissance]], [[target acquisition]] and [[bomb damage assessment|impact feedback]] for [[air strike]]s and [[artillery]], assisting employed combat force with accurate [[fire support]] and [[counter-sniper tactics]], killing enemy [[commander]]s, selecting targets of opportunity, and even [[matériel|destruction of military equipment]], which tend to require use of [[anti-materiel rifle]]s in the larger calibers such as the [[.50 BMG]], like the [[Barrett M82]], [[McMillan Tac-50]], and [[Denel NTW-20]].<ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

[[Soviet]]- and Russian-derived military [[doctrine]]s include [[military unit|squad-level]] snipers. Snipers have increasingly been demonstrated as useful by US and UK forces in the recent [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq campaign]] in a [[fire support]] role to cover the movement of infantry, especially in [[Urban combat|urban]] areas.<ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

Military snipers from the US, UK and other countries that adopt their military doctrine are typically deployed in two-man [[Sniper#Sniper teams|sniper team]]s consisting of a shooter and a [[spotter (sniping)|spotter]].<ref name="Senich p. ">{{harvnb|Senich|1988|p=}}</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2018}} A common practice is for a shooter and a spotter to take turns to avoid [[asthenopia|eye fatigue]].<ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}} In most recent combat operations occurring in large densely populated towns, such as [[Fallujah, Iraq]], two teams would be deployed together to increase their security and effectiveness in an urban environment. A sniper team would be armed with a long-range weapon and a rapid-firing shorter-ranged weapon in case of [[close quarter combat]].

The German doctrine of largely independent snipers and emphasis on concealment, developed during the Second World War, has been most influential on modern sniper tactics, and is currently used throughout Western militaries (examples are specialized camouflage clothing, concealment in terrain and emphasis on [[coup d'œil]]).<ref name="Senich 1982 p.

===Sniper teams===
{{more citations needed section|date=September 2019}}
[[Image:061019-A-7603F-151.jpg|thumb|right|A U.S. Army sniper team from [[Jalalabad]] Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT)]]
[[Sniper rifle]]s are classified as [[crew served weapon|crew-served]] in the [[United States military]]. A '''sniper team''' (or '''sniper cell''') consists of a combination of at least one primary weapon operator, (ie: the shooter), with other support personnel and force protection elements, such as a ''spotter'' or a ''flanker''. Within the ''[[Table of Organization and Equipment]]'' for both the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], the shooter does not operate alone, but has a backup shooter trained to fulfill multiple roles in addition to being sniper-qualified in the operation of the main weapon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://science.howstuffworks.com/sniper2.htm|title=How Military Snipers Work|last=Valdes|first=Robert|date=11 June 2004|website=HowStuffWorks}}</ref>

The shooter focuses mainly on firing the shot, while the spotter assists in observation of targets, accounts for [[atmospheric sciences|atmospheric conditions]] and handles ancillary tasks as immediate security of their location, communication with other parties (e.g. directing [[artillery]] fire and [[close air support]]). A flanker is an extra teammate who is tasked to act as a [[picket (military)|sentry]] observing areas not immediately visible to the sniper and spotter, assisting with the team's rear security and [[perimeter defense]], and therefore are usually armed with a faster-firing weapon such as an [[assault rifle]], [[battle rifle]] or [[designated marksman rifle]]. Both the spotter and flanker carry additional ammunition and associated equipment.<ref name="Shah">{{Cite web|url=https://fasttimesintech.com/2016/09/12/the-sniper-and-the-spotter/|title=The Sniper and the Spotter|last=Shah|first=Hiren|date=12 September 2016|website=Fast Times in Tech {{!}} Blog by Hiren Shah|language=en|access-date=24 March 2019}}</ref>

The spotter is responsible for detecting, identifying and assigning priority of targets for the shooter, as well as assessing the outcome of the shot. Using a [[spotting scope]] and/or a [[rangefinder]], the spotter will predict the [[external ballistics]] and read the [[wind speed]] using an [[anemometer]] or physical indicators like the [[mirage]] caused by ground heat. Also, in conjunction with the shooter, the spotter will calculate the distance, shooting angle ([[slant range]]), [[angular mil|mil]]-related correction, interference by atmospheric factors and the [[deflection shooting|required leads]] for moving targets. It is not unusual for the spotter to be equipped with a [[ballistic table]], a [[laptop|notebook]] or a [[tablet computer]] specifically for performing these calculations.

===Law enforcement applications===
[[File:YAMAM-sniper-0020.jpg|thumb|[[YAMAM]] (Israel's [[counter-terrorism unit]]) sniper shooting with suppressed [[Barrett MRAD]] sniper rifles]]
[[Law enforcement sniper]]s, commonly called police snipers, and military snipers differ in many ways, including their areas of operation and tactics. A police sharpshooter is part of a police operation and usually takes part in relatively short missions. Police forces typically deploy such sharpshooters in [[hostage]] scenarios. This differs from a military sniper, who operates as part of a larger army, engaged in warfare. Sometimes as part of a [[SWAT]] team, police snipers are deployed alongside negotiators and an assault team trained for [[Close combat|close quarters combat]]. As policemen, they are trained to shoot only as a last resort, when there is a direct threat to life; the police sharpshooter has a well-known rule: "Be prepared to take a life to save a life."<ref name="cbssniper"/> Police snipers typically operate at much shorter ranges than military snipers, generally under {{convert|100|m|yd|0|sp=us}} and sometimes even less than {{convert|50|m|yd|0|sp=us}}. Both types of snipers do make difficult shots under pressure, and often perform one-shot kills.

The need for specialized training for police sharpshooters was made apparent in 1972 during the [[Munich massacre]] when the German police could not deploy specialized personnel or equipment during the standoff at the airport in the closing phase of the crisis, and consequently all of the Israeli hostages were killed. While the German army did have snipers in 1972, the use of army snipers in the scenario was impossible due to the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]]'s explicit prohibition of the use of the military in domestic matters. This lack of trained snipers who could be used in civilian roles was later addressed with the founding of the specialized police counter-terrorist unit [[GSG 9]].

==Military history==
Before the development of [[rifling]], firearms were [[smoothbore]] and inaccurate over long distance. Barrel rifling was invented at the end of the fifteenth century, but was only employed in large cannons. Over time, rifling, along with other gunnery advances, has increased the performance of modern firearms.

===1701–1800===
Early forms of sniping or marksmanship were used during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. For instance, in 1777 at the [[battle of Saratoga]] the Colonists hid in the trees and used early model rifles to shoot British officers. Most notably, [[Timothy Murphy (sniper)|Timothy Murphy]] shot and killed General [[Simon Fraser of Balnain]] on 7 October 1777 at a distance of about 400 yards.<ref name="MastHalberstadt2007">{{cite book|author1=Gregory Mast|author2=Hans Halberstadt|title=To Be a Military Sniper|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A64US-2Em2YC&pg=PA18|access-date=12 July 2013|date=January 2007|publisher=Zenith Imprint|isbn=978-0-7603-3002-9|page=18}}</ref><ref name="Rose2008">{{cite book|author=Alexander Rose|title=American Rifle: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bWaAiSScrRcC&pg=PT46|access-date=12 July 2013|date=21 October 2008|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|location=New York|isbn=978-0-440-33809-3|page=46}}</ref><ref name="Dougan2006">{{cite book|author=Andy Dougan|title=Through the Crosshairs: A History of Snipers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CpJ7fH7I0gkC&pg=PA47|access-date=12 July 2013|date=1 June 2006|publisher=Da Capo Press, Incorporated|isbn=978-0-7867-1773-6|page=47}}</ref> During the [[Battle of Brandywine]], Capt.

A special unit of marksmen was established during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in the [[British Army]]. While most troops at that time used inaccurate [[smoothbore]] [[musket]]s, the British "[[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)|Green Jackets]]" (named for their distinctive green uniforms) used the famous [[Baker rifle]]. Through the combination of a leather wad and tight grooves on the inside of the barrel ([[rifling]]), this weapon was far more accurate, though slower to load. These [[Riflemen]] were the elite of the British Army, and served at the forefront of any engagement, most often in skirmish formation, scouting out and delaying the enemy. Another term, "sharp shooter" was in use in British newspapers as early as 1801. In the ''Edinburgh Advertiser'', 23 June 1801, can be found the following quote in a piece about the North British Militia; "This Regiment has several Field Pieces, and two companies of Sharp Shooters, which are very necessary in the modern Stile of War". The term appears even earlier, around 1781, in Continental Europe, translated from the German Scharfschütze.

===1801–1900===
[[Military of the Ashanti Empire#Organization|Scouts]] in the [[Military of the Ashanti Empire|Ashanti army]] were made up of professional hunters who used their skill as [[marksmen]] to snipe at advancing enemy forces in response to detection by the enemy. They executed this often from a perch high in trees.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tkm5UZJz8z0C&q=marksmen+to+snipe|last=Edgerton |first=Robert B. |year=2010 |title=The Fall of the Asante Empire: The Hundred-Year War For Africa's Gold Coast |page=54|isbn=9781451603736 }}</ref>
The [[Whitworth rifle]] was arguably the first long-range [[sniper rifle]] in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.americancivilwarstory.com/whitworth-rifle.html|title=Whitworth Rifle|website=American Civil War Stories}}</ref> A [[muzzleloader]] designed by Sir [[Joseph Whitworth]], a prominent British engineer, it used [[polygonal rifling]] instead, which meant that the projectile did not have to bite into grooves as was done with conventional rifling. The Whitworth rifle was far more accurate than the [[Pattern 1853 Enfield]], which had shown some weaknesses during the recent [[Crimean War]]. At trials in 1857 which tested the accuracy and range of both weapons, Whitworth's design outperformed the Enfield at a rate of about three to one. The Whitworth rifle was capable of hitting the target at a range of 2,000 yards, whereas the Enfield could only manage it at 1,400 yards.<ref>"Minutes of proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Volume 19" By Institution of Civil Engineers (Great Britain)</ref>

During the [[Crimean War]], the first optical sights were designed to fit onto rifles. Much of this pioneering work was the brainchild of Colonel D. Davidson, using optical sights produced by [[Chance Brothers]] of [[Birmingham]]. This allowed a marksman to observe and target objects more accurately at a greater distance than ever before.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=COCIaPM2_ksC&q=Battle+of+Freeman%27s+Farm+sniping|title=Out of Nowhere: A history of the military sniper, from the Sharpshooter to Afghanistan|author=Pegler, Martin|year=2011|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=9781849088756|access-date=18 November 2013}}</ref> The telescopic sight, or scope, was originally fixed and could not be adjusted, which therefore limited its range.

===Second Boer War===
[[File:Burnham in africa close up.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frederick Russell Burnham]] in Africa]] 
During the [[Boer War]] the latest [[breech-loading weapon|breech-loading]] [[rifling|rifled]] guns with [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]]s and [[smokeless powder]] were used by both sides. The British were equipped with the [[Lee–Metford]] rifle, while the Boers had received the latest [[Mauser]] rifles from Germany. In the open terrain of South Africa the marksmen were a crucial component to the outcome of the battle.

The first British sniper unit began life as the [[Lovat Scouts]], a Scottish Highland regiment formed in 1899, that earned high praise during the [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902).<ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}} The unit was formed by [[Simon Fraser, 14th Lord Lovat|Lord Lovat]] and reported to an American, Major [[Frederick Russell Burnham]], the British Army Chief of Scouts under [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]]. Burnham fittingly described these scouts as "half wolf and half jackrabbit.".<ref name="Plaster p. 5">{{harvnb|Plaster|2007|p=5}}</ref> Just like their Boer scout opponents, these scouts were well practised in the arts of marksmanship, [[field craft]], map reading, observation, and [[military tactics]].<ref name="cooper1994">{{cite journal| date=July 1994| title=Cooper's Scout rifle a gun for all reasons: whether it be for hunting or individual combat, this concept may just be the ultimate dual-purpose rifle | last=Copper | first= Jeff| journal=[[Guns & Ammo]]| volume=38| issue=7| issn=0017-5684| page=74}}</ref> They were skilled [[woodsmen]] and practitioners of discretion: "He who shoots and runs away, lives to shoot another day."

After the war, this regiment went on to formally become the first official sniper unit, then better known as ''sharpshooters''.<ref name="Plaster p. 5"/>

===World War I===

During [[World War I]], snipers appeared as deadly sharpshooters in the trenches. At the start of the war, only [[Imperial Germany]] had troops that were issued scoped [[sniper rifle]]s. Although sharpshooters existed on all sides, the Germans specially equipped some of their soldiers with scoped rifles that could pick off enemy soldiers showing their heads out of their trench.<ref name="Senich 1982 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}} At first the French and British believed such hits to be coincidental hits, until the German scoped rifles were discovered.<ref name="Senich 1982 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}} During World War I, the German army received a reputation for the deadliness and efficiency of its snipers, partly because of the high-quality lenses that German industry could manufacture.<ref name="Senich 1982 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

During the First World War, the static movement of [[trench warfare]] and a need for protection from snipers created a requirement for [[Loophole (firearm)|loopholes]] both for discharging firearms and for observation.<ref name="One">{{Cite web|url=https://ww1revisited.com/2014/03/16/trench-loopholes-le-linge/|title=Trench Loopholes, Le Linge|date=16 March 2014}}</ref> Often a steel plate was used with a "key hole", which had a rotating piece to cover the loophole when not in use.<ref name="One" />

Soon the British army began to train their own snipers in specialized sniper schools. Major [[Hesketh Hesketh-Prichard]] was given formal permission to begin sniper training in 1915, and founded the [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] School of Sniping, Observation, and Scouting at [[Linghem]] in France in 1916.<ref name="Parker pp. 211-212">{{harvnb|Parker|1924|pp=211–212}}</ref> Starting with a first class of only six, in time he was able to lecture to large numbers of soldiers from different Allied nations, proudly proclaiming in a letter that his school was turning out snipers at three times the rate of any such other school in the world.<ref name="Parker_p211-212">{{cite book|last=Parker|first=Eric|title=Hesketh Prichard|page=212}}</ref>

He also devised a metal-armoured double loophole that would protect the sniper observer from enemy fire. The front loophole was fixed, but the rear was housed in a metal shutter sliding in grooves. Only when the two loopholes were lined up—a one-to-twenty chance—could an enemy shoot between them.<ref name="sniping_chap5">{{cite book|last=Hesketh-Prichard|first=H.V.|title=Sniping in France|year=1994|pages=Chapter 5|url=http://www.allworldwars.com/Sniping%20in%20France%20by%20Major%20Hesketh-Prichard.html|isbn=0-85052-426-1}}</ref> Another innovation was the use of a dummy head to find the location of an enemy sniper.<ref name="sniping_chap2">{{cite book|last=Hesketh-Prichard|first=H.V.|title=Sniping in France|year=1994|pages=Chapter 2|url=http://www.allworldwars.com/Sniping%20in%20France%20by%20Major%20Hesketh-Prichard.html|isbn=0-85052-426-1}}</ref> The [[papier-mâché]] figures were painted to resemble soldiers to draw sniper fire. Some were equipped with rubber surgical tubing so the dummy could "smoke" a cigarette and thus appear realistic. Holes punched in the dummy by enemy sniper bullets then could be used for triangulation purposes to determine the position of the enemy sniper, who could then be attacked with [[artillery]] fire. He developed many of the modern techniques in sniping, including the use of spotting scopes and working in pairs, and using [[Kim's Game]] to train observational skills.<ref name="Prichard-Vernon pp. 10,19">{{harvnb|Prichard|Vernon|2004| pp=10,19}}</ref>

In 1920, he wrote his account of his war time activities in his book ''[[wikisource:Sniping in France|Sniping in France]]'', to which reference is still made by modern authors regarding the subject.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/cu31924027946619|title=Sniping in France : with notes on the scientific training of scouts, observers, and snipers|first=Hesketh Vernon Hesketh|last=Prichard|date=19 April 1920|publisher=New York : E.P.

===World War II===
[[File:Pav-Stamp.jpg|right|thumb|Soviet sniper [[Lyudmila Pavlichenko]] on a 1943 stamp.]]

During the [[interbellum]], most nations dropped their specialized sniper units, notably the Germans. Effectiveness and dangers of snipers once again came to the fore during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The only nation that had specially trained sniper units during the 1930s was the [[Soviet Union]]. Soviet snipers were trained in their skills as marksmen, in using the terrain to hide themselves from the enemy and the ability to work alongside regular forces. This made the Soviet sniper training focus more on "normal" combat situations than those of other nations.

Snipers reappeared as important factors on the battlefield from the [[Invasion of Poland|first campaign of World War II]]. During Germany's [[Battle of France|1940 campaigns]], lone, well-hidden French and British snipers were able to halt the German advance for a considerable amount of time. For example, during the pursuit to [[Dunkirk]], British snipers were able to significantly delay the German infantry's advance. This prompted the British once again to increase training of specialized sniper units. Apart from marksmanship, British snipers were trained to blend in with the environment, often by using special camouflage clothing for concealment. However, because the British Army offered sniper training exclusively to [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] and [[non-commissioned officer]]s, the resulting small number of trained snipers in combat units considerably reduced their overall effectiveness.<ref name="Shore p. 316"/>

During the [[Winter War]], Finnish snipers took a heavy toll of the invading [[Soviet army]].

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 169-0526, Russland, Scharfschütze in Stellung.jpg|thumb|left|German sniper in [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]], [[Soviet Union]] (1942)]]

One of the best known battles involving snipers, and the battle that made the Germans reinstate their specialized sniper training, was the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]. Their defensive position inside a city filled with rubble meant that Soviet snipers were able to inflict significant casualties on the Wehrmacht troops. Because of the nature of fighting in city rubble, snipers were very hard to spot and seriously dented the [[morale]] of the German attackers. The best known of these snipers was probably [[Vasily Zaitsev (sniper)|Vasily Zaytsev]], featured in the novel ''[[War of the Rats]]'' and the subsequent film ''[[Enemy at the Gates]]''.

German ''Scharfschützen'' were prepared before the war, equipped with [[Karabiner 98]] and later [[Gewehr 43]] rifles, but there were often not enough of these weapons available, and as such some were armed with captured scoped [[Mosin–Nagant]] 1891/30, SVT, Czech Mauser rifles or scoped Gewehr 98 from WW1. The Wehrmacht re-established its sniper training in 1942, drastically increasing the number of snipers per unit with the creation of an additional 31 sniper training companies by 1944. German snipers were at the time the only snipers in the world issued with purpose-manufactured sniping ammunition, known as the 'effect-firing' sS round.<ref>Peter R. Senich: German Sniper 1914–45, Page 91</ref> The 'effect-firing' sS round featured an extra carefully measured propellant charge and seated a heavy 12.8&nbsp;gram (198 gr) full-metal-jacketed boat-tail projectile of match-grade build quality, lacking usual features such as a seating ring to improve the already high ballistic coefficient of .584 (G1) further.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://home.scarlet.be/p.colmant/polte.htg/p41.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=6 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219092531/http://home.scarlet.be/p.colmant/polte.htg/p41.jpg |archive-date=19 February 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> For aiming optics German snipers used the [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] Zielvier 4x (ZF39) [[telescopic sight]] which had [[bullet drop compensation]] in 50 m increments for ranges from 100 m up to 800 m or in some variations from 100 m up to 1000 m or 1200 m. There were ZF42, Zielfernrohr 43 (ZF 4), Zeiss Zielsechs 6x, Zeiss Zielacht 8x and other telescopic sights by various manufacturers like the Ajack 4x, Hensoldt Dialytan 4x and Kahles Heliavier 4x with similar features employed on German sniper rifles. Several different [[Telescopic sight#Mounting|mountings]] produced by various manufacturers were used for mounting aiming optics to the rifles. In February 1945 the [[Zielgerät 1229]] active infrared aiming device was issued for night sniping with the [[StG 44]] assault rifle.

A total of 428,335 individuals received Red Army sniper training, including Soviet and non-Soviet partisans, with 9,534 receiving the sniping 'higher qualification'. During World War ІІ, two six-month training courses for women alone trained nearly 55,000 snipers, of which more than two thousand later served in the army.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shotgun.com.ua/class/sniping/snip_hist_12.html |title=Снайперское движение в РККА &#124; История снайперского искусства |publisher=Shotgun.com.ua |access-date=1 June 2011}}</ref>{{Verify source|date=January 2011}} On average there was at least one sniper in an infantry platoon and one in every reconnaissance platoon, including in tank and even artillery units.{{Verify source|date=January 2011}} Some used the [[PTRD]] [[anti-tank rifle]] with an adapted scope as an early example of an [[anti-materiel rifle]].

[[File:A sniper from "C" Company, 5th Battalion, The Black Watch, 51st (Highland) Division, in position in the loft space of a ruined building in Gennep, Holland, 14 February 1945. B14628.jpg|thumb|A British sniper in [[Gennep]], Holland, 14 February 1945.]]

[[File:Pte. L. V. Hughes, Canadian Military, WW2.jpg|thumb|upright|Canadian Sniper during [[World War II]].]]

In the United States Armed Forces, sniper training was only very elementary and was mainly concerned with being able to hit targets over long distances. Snipers were required to be able to hit a body over 400 meters away, and a head over 200 meters away. There was almost no instruction in blending into the environment. Sniper training varied from place to place, resulting in wide variation in the qualities of snipers. The main reason the US did not extend sniper training beyond long-range shooting was the limited deployment of US soldiers until the [[Normandy Invasion]]. During the campaigns in [[Operation Torch|North Africa]] and [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]], most fighting occurred in [[arid]] and mountainous regions where the potential for concealment was limited, in contrast to Western and Central Europe.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

The U.S. Army's lack of familiarity with sniping tactics proved disastrous in Normandy and the campaign in Western Europe where they encountered well trained German snipers.<ref name="Senich 1982 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}} In Normandy, German snipers remained hidden in the dense vegetation and were able to encircle American units, firing at them from all sides. The American and British forces were surprised by how near the German snipers could approach in safety and attack them, as well as by their ability to hit targets at up to 1,000m. A notable mistake made by inexperienced American soldiers was to lie down and wait when targeted by German snipers, allowing the snipers to pick them off one after another.<ref name="Senich 1982 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}} German snipers often infiltrated Allied lines and sometimes when the front-lines moved, they continued to fight from their sniping positions, refusing to surrender until their rations and munitions were exhausted.

Those tactics were also a consequence of changes in German enlistment. After several years of war and heavy losses on the Eastern Front, the German army was forced to rely more heavily on enlisting teenage soldiers. Due to lack of training in more complex group tactics, and thanks to rifle training provided by the [[Hitlerjugend]], those soldiers were often used as autonomous left-behind snipers. While an experienced sniper would take a few lethal shots and retreat to a safer position, those young boys, due both to a disregard for their own safety and to lack of tactical experience would frequently remain in a concealed position and fight until they ran out of ammunition or were killed or wounded. While this tactic generally ended in the demise of the sniper, giving rise to the nickname "Suicide Boys" that was given to those soldiers, this irrational behavior proved quite disruptive to the Allied forces' progress. After World War II, many elements of German sniper training and doctrine were copied by other countries.<ref name="Senich 1982 p. "/>

In the [[Pacific War]], the [[Empire of Japan]] trained snipers. In the jungles of Asia and the Pacific Islands, snipers posed a serious threat to U.S., British, and [[British Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] troops. Japanese snipers were specially trained to use the environment to conceal themselves. Japanese snipers used foliage on their uniforms and dug well-concealed hide-outs that were often connected with small trenches. There was no need for long range accuracy because most combat in the jungle took place within a few hundred meters. Japanese snipers were known for their patience and ability to remain hidden for long periods. They almost never left their carefully camouflaged hiding spots. This meant that whenever a sniper was in the area, the location of the sniper could be determined after the sniper had fired a few shots. The Allies used their own snipers in the Pacific, notably the U.S. Marines, who used [[M1903 Springfield rifle]]s.

Common sniper rifles used during the [[Second World War]] include: the Soviet M1891/30 [[Mosin–Nagant]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[SVT-40]]; the German [[Mauser]] [[Karabiner 98k]] and [[Gewehr 43]]; the British [[Lee–Enfield No. 4]] and [[Pattern 1914 Enfield]]; the Japanese [[Type 97 Sniper Rifle|Arisaka 97]]; the American [[M1903 Springfield rifle#Variants|M1903A4 Springfield]] and [[M1 Garand#Sniper models|M1C Garand]]. The Italians trained few snipers and supplied them with a scoped [[Carcano]] Model 1891.

==Training==

[[File:Rackandchamber.jpg|thumb|A US Marine extracts a fired cartridge casing and chambers a new round into his [[M40 (rifle)|M40A3]].]]

Military sniper training aims to teach a high degree of proficiency in [[camouflage]] and concealment, stalking, [[Observing|observation]] and map reading as well as precision marksmanship under various operational conditions. Trainees typically shoot thousands of rounds over a number of weeks, while learning these core skills.

Snipers are trained to squeeze the trigger straight back with the ball of their finger, to avoid jerking the gun sideways.<ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}} The most accurate position is [[Prone position|prone]], with a [[sandbag]] supporting the [[Stock (firearms)|stock]], and the stock's cheek-piece against the cheek.<ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}} In the field, a [[bipod]] can be used instead. Sometimes a [[sling (firearms)|sling]] is wrapped around the weak arm (or both) to reduce stock movement.<ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/> Some doctrines train a sniper to breathe deeply before shooting, then hold their [[human lung|lung]]s empty while they line up and take their shot.<ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}} Some go further, teaching their snipers to shoot between heartbeats to minimize barrel motion.<ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

===Accuracy===
[[File:Royal Marines snipers displaying their L115A1 rifles.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Marines]] sniper displaying his [[L115A1]] rifle resting on three-legged [[Shooting sticks (weapon mount)|shooting sticks]]]]

The key to sniping is accuracy, which applies to both the weapon and the shooter. The weapon should be able to consistently place shots within tight tolerances.<ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}} The sniper in turn must use the weapon to accurately place shots under varying conditions.<ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

A sniper must have the ability to accurately estimate the various factors that influence a bullet's trajectory and point of impact such as: range to the target, wind direction, wind velocity, altitude and elevation of the sniper and the target and ambient temperature. Mistakes in estimation compound over distance and can decrease lethality or cause a shot to miss completely.<ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

Snipers [[Calibration|zero]] their weapons at a target range or in the field. This is the process of adjusting the scope so that the bullets' points-of-impact are at the point-of-aim (centre of scope or scope's cross-hairs) for a specific distance.<ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}} A rifle and scope should retain its zero as long as possible under all conditions to reduce the need to re-zero during missions.<ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

A [[sandbag]] can serve as a useful platform for shooting a sniper rifle, although any soft surface such as a [[rucksack]] will steady a rifle and contribute to consistency.<ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}} In particular, [[bipod]]s help when firing from a prone position, and enable the firing position to be sustained for an extended period of time. Many police and military sniper rifles come equipped with an adjustable bipod.<ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}} Makeshift bipods known as [[Shooting sticks (weapon mount)|shooting sticks]] can be constructed from items such as tree branches or ski poles.<ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}} Some military snipers use three-legged shooting sticks.

Range and accuracy vary depending on the cartridge and specific ammunition types that are used. Typical ranges for common battle field cartridges are as follows:

Military snipers may be further trained as [[forward air control]]lers (FACs) to direct [[air strike]]s or [[Artillery observer|forward observers]] (FOs) to direct [[artillery]] or [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] fire.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Russian Army===
From 2011, the Russian armed forces has run newly developed sniper courses in [[military district]] training centres. In place of the Soviet practice of mainly squad sharpshooters, which were often designated during initial training (and of whom only few become snipers ''per se''), "new" Army snipers are to be trained intensively for 3 months (for conscripts) or longer (for contract soldiers). The training program includes theory and practice of countersniper engagements, artillery spotting and coordination of air support.<ref name="Shah"/> The first instructors are the graduates of the Solnechnogorsk sniper training centre.

The method of sniper deployment, according to the Ministry of Defence, is likely to be one three-platoon company at the brigade level, with one of the platoons acting independently and the other two supporting the battalions as needed.<ref>Gavrilov, Yuri [http://www.rg.ru/2011/10/19/snaiper.html "Take a bead: Army gets sniper schools"] Rossiiskaya gazeta'' 19 October 2011.</ref>

===Range finding===
The range to the target is measured or estimated as precisely as conditions permit and correct range estimation becomes absolutely critical at long ranges, because a bullet travels with a curved [[trajectory]] and the sniper must compensate for this by aiming higher at longer distances.<ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}} If the exact distance is not known the sniper may compensate incorrectly and the bullet path may be too high or low. As an example, for a typical military sniping cartridge such as [[7.62×51mm NATO]] (.308 Winchester) M118 Special Ball round this difference (or "drop") from {{convert|700|to(-)|800|m|yd|sp=us}} is {{convert|200|mm}}. This means that if the sniper incorrectly estimated the distance as 700 meters when the target was in fact 800 meters away, the bullet will be 200 millimeters lower than expected by the time it reaches the target.<ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

[[Laser rangefinder]]s may be used, and range estimation is often the job of both parties in a team.<ref name="Plaster 2006">{{harvnb|Plaster|2006|p=346}}</ref> One useful method of range finding without a laser rangefinder is comparing the height of the target (or nearby objects) to their size on the mil dot scope, or taking a known distance and using some sort of measure (utility poles, fence posts) to determine the additional distance. The average human head is {{convert|150|mm|sp=us}} in width, average human shoulders are {{convert|500|mm|sp=us}} apart and the average distance from a person's pelvis to the top of their head is {{convert|1000|mm|sp=us}}.

To determine the range to a target without a laser rangefinder, the sniper may use the [[Angular mil|mil]] dot [[reticle]] on a scope to accurately find the range. Mil dots are used like a [[slide rule]] to measure the height of a target, and if the height is known, the range can be as well. The height of the target (in yards) ×1000, divided by the height of the target (in mils), gives the range in yards. This is only in general, however, as both scope magnification (7×, 40×) and mil dot spacing change. The USMC standard is that 1 mil (that is, 1 milliradian) equals 3.438 MOA ([[minute of arc]], or, equivalently, minute of angle), while the US Army standard is 3.6 MOA, chosen so as to give a diameter of 1 yard at a distance of 1,000 yards (or equivalently, a diameter of 1 meter at a range of 1 kilometer.) Many commercial manufacturers use 3.5, splitting the difference, since it is easier to work with.<ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}{{verify source|date=June 2016}}

It is important to note that [[angular mil]] (''mil'') is only an approximation of a [[milliradian]] and different organizations use [[Angular mil#Definitions of the angular mil|different approximations]].

At longer ranges, bullet drop plays a significant role in targeting.<ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}} The effect can be estimated from a chart, which may be memorized or taped to the rifle, although some scopes come with [[telescopic sight#Bullet drop compensation|Bullet Drop Compensator]] (BDC) systems that only require the range be dialed in. These are tuned to both a specific class of rifle and specific ammunition. Every bullet type and load will have different [[ballistics]]. .308 Federal 175 grain (11.3 g) BTHP match shoots at {{convert|2600|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. Zeroed at {{convert|100|yd|m|-2}}, a 16.2 MOA adjustment would have to be made to hit a target at {{convert|600|yd|m|-2}}. If the same bullet was shot with 168 grain (10.9 g), a 17.1 MOA adjustment would be necessary.<ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

Shooting uphill or downhill is confusing for many because [[gravity]] does not act perpendicular to the direction the bullet is traveling. Thus, gravity must be divided into its component [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s. Only the fraction of gravity equal to the [[cosine]] of the angle of fire with respect to the horizon affects the rate of fall of the bullet, with the remainder adding or subtracting negligible velocity to the bullet along its trajectory. To find the correct zero, the sniper multiplies the actual distance to the range by this fraction and aims as if the target were that distance away. For example, a sniper who observes a target 500 meters away at a 45-degree angle downhill would multiply the range by the cosine of 45 degrees, which is 0.707. The resulting distance will be 353 meters. This number is equal to the horizontal distance to the target. All other values, such as windage, time-to-target, impact velocity, and energy will be calculated based on the actual range of 500 meters. Recently, a small device known as a cosine indicator has been developed.<ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}} This device is clamped to the tubular body of the [[telescopic sight]], and gives an indicative readout in numerical form as the rifle is aimed up or down at the target.<ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}} This is translated into a figure used to compute the horizontal range to the target.

Windage plays a significant role, with the effect increasing with wind speed or the distance of the shot. The slant of visible convections near the ground can be used to estimate crosswinds, and correct the point of aim. All adjustments for range, wind, and elevation can be performed by aiming off the target, called "holding over" or [[Kentucky windage]].<ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}} Alternatively, the scope can be adjusted so that the point of aim is changed to compensate for these factors, sometimes referred to as "dialing in". The shooter must remember to return the scope to zeroed position. Adjusting the scope allows for more accurate shots, because the cross-hairs can be aligned with the target more accurately, but the sniper must know exactly what differences the changes will have on the point-of-impact at each target range.<ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

For moving targets, the point-of-aim is ahead of the target in the direction of movement. Known as "leading" the target, the amount of "lead" depends on the speed and angle of the target's movement as well as the distance to the target. For this technique, holding over is the preferred method.<ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}} Anticipating the behavior of the target is necessary to accurately place the shot.<ref name="Plaster 1993 p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

===Hide sites and hiding techniques===
[[File:Camouflaged-sniper.jpg|thumb|right|A sniper wearing a [[ghillie suit]] to remain hidden in grassland terrain]]

The term "hide site" refers to a covered and concealed position from which a sniper and his team can conduct surveillance or fire at targets. A good hide conceals and camouflages the sniper effectively, provides cover from enemy fire and allows a wide view of the surrounding area.

The main purpose of [[ghillie suit]]s and hide sites is to break up the outline of a person with a rifle.

Many snipers use ghillie suits to hide and stay hidden. Ghillie suits vary according to the terrain into which the sniper wishes to blend. For example, in dry grassland the sniper will typically wear a ghillie suit covered in dead grass.

===Shot placement===
Shot placement, which is where on the body the sniper is aiming, varies with the type of sniper. Military snipers, who generally do not shoot at targets at less than {{convert|300|m|yd|abbr=on}}, usually attempt body shots, aiming at the chest. These shots depend on tissue damage, organ trauma, and [[Bleeding|blood loss]] to kill the target. Body shots are used because the chest is a larger target.

Police snipers, who generally shoot at much shorter distances, may attempt a more precise shot at particular parts of body or particular devices: in one incident in 2007 in [[Marseille]], a [[GIPN]] sniper took a shot from {{convert|80|m|yd|abbr=on}} at the pistol of a police officer threatening to commit suicide, destroying the weapon and preventing the police officer from killing himself.<ref name="www.laprovence.com">{{cite web|date= 2 August 2007|url = http://www.laprovence.com/article/region/jai-fait-mouche-sur-son-arme-a-80-metres-pour-le-sauver|title =J'ai fait mouche sur son arme à 80 mètres pour le sauver (ENG:I hit his weapon at 80 meters to save him)|publisher = laprovence.com| access-date = 14 May 2010| last=Pardini| first= Sèverine }}</ref>

In a high-risk or hostage-taking situation where a suspect is imminently threatening to kill a hostage, police snipers may take head shots to ensure an instant kill. The snipers aim for the [[medulla oblongata]] to sever the spine from the brain. While this is believed to prevent the target from reflexively firing their weapon, there is evidence that any brain-hit is sufficient.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sniper: SAS and Elite Forces Guide|author=Martin J Dougherty|year=2012|publisher=Amber Books|isbn=9781909160385|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j1Dm6EnU7mkC&q=sniper+medulla+oblongata&pg=PT205|access-date=12 January 2018}}</ref>

===Target acquisition===
{{main|Target acquisition}}
[[File:Marine sniper ghillie suit.JPG|right|thumb|A U.S. Marine sniper wearing a [[ghillie suit]].]]
[[File:IDF sniping competition. IIa.jpg|thumb|Two [[Israel Defense Forces]] snipers (one serves as the shooter and the other as a spotter), armed with the "Barak" ([[H-S Precision Pro Series 2000 HTR]]) sniper weapon system, during sniping contest.]]

Snipers are trained for the detection, identification, and location of a targeted soldier in sufficient detail to permit the effective employment of lethal and non-lethal means. Since most kills in modern warfare are by [[crew-served weapon]]s, reconnaissance is one of the most effective uses of snipers. They use their aerobic conditioning, infiltration skills and excellent long-distance observation equipment (optical scopes) and tactics to approach and observe the enemy. In this role, their [[rules of engagement]] typically let them shoot at high-value targets of opportunity, such as enemy officers.

The targets may be personnel or high-value [[materiel]] (military equipment and weapons) but most often they target the most important enemy personnel such as officers or specialists (e.g. communications operators) so as to cause maximum disruption to enemy operations. Other personnel they might target include those who pose an immediate threat to the sniper, like dog handlers, who are often employed in a search for snipers. A sniper identifies officers by their appearance and behavior such as symbols of rank, talking to [[Radioman|radio operators]], sitting as a passenger in a car, sitting in a car with a large radio antenna, having military servants, binoculars/map cases or talking and moving position more frequently. If possible, snipers shoot in descending order by [[Military rank|rank]], or if rank is unavailable, they shoot to disrupt communications.

Some rifles, such as the [[Denel NTW-20]] and [[Vidhwansak]], are designed for a purely [[anti-materiel rifle|anti-materiel]] (AM) role, e.g. shooting turbine disks of parked aircraft, missile guidance packages, expensive optics, and the bearings, tubes or wave guides of [[radar]] sets. A sniper equipped with the correct rifle can target radar dishes, water containers, the engines of vehicles, and any number of other targets. Other rifles, such as the .50 caliber rifles produced by [[Barrett Firearms Manufacturing|Barrett]] and McMillan, are not designed exclusively as AM rifles, but are often employed in such a way, providing the range and power needed for AM applications in a lightweight package compared to most traditional AM rifles. Other calibers, such as the [[.408 Cheyenne Tactical]] and the .338 Lapua Magnum, are designed to be capable of limited AM application, but are ideally suited as long range anti-personnel rounds.

===Relocating===
Often in situations with multiple targets, snipers use relocation. After firing a few shots from a certain position, snipers move unseen to another location before the enemy can determine where they are and mount a counter-attack. Snipers will frequently use this tactic to their advantage, creating an atmosphere of chaos and confusion. In other, rarer situations, relocation is used to eliminate the factor of wind.

===Sound masking===
As [[sniper rifle]]s are often extremely powerful and consequently loud, it is common for snipers to use a technique known as sound masking. When employed by a highly skilled marksman, this tactic can be used as a substitute for a noise [[suppressor]]. Very loud sounds in the environment, such as artillery shells air bursting or claps of thunder, can often mask the sound of the shot. This technique is frequently used in [[clandestine operations]], [[infiltration tactics]], and [[guerrilla warfare]].

===Psychological warfare===
[[File:USMC Sniper M24.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Special Reaction Teams|Special Reaction Team]] with an [[M24 Sniper Weapon System]] in 2004.]]
Due to the surprise nature of sniper fire, high lethality of aimed shots and frustration at the inability to locate and counterattack snipers, sniper tactics have a significant negative effect on morale. Extensive use of sniper tactics can be used to induce constant stress and fear in opposing forces, making them afraid to move about or leave cover. In many ways, the psychological impact imposed by snipers is quite similar to those of [[landmines]], [[booby-trap]]s, and [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]] (constant threat, high "per event" lethality, inability to strike back).<ref name="MastHalberstadt2007_2">{{cite book|author1=Gregory Mast|author2=Hans Halberstadt|title=To Be a Military Sniper|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A64US-2Em2YC&pg=PA22|access-date=12 July 2013|date=January 2007|publisher=Zenith Imprint|isbn=978-0-7603-3002-9|page=22}}</ref><ref name="Halberstadt2008">{{cite book|author=Hans Halberstadt|title=Trigger Men: Shadow Team, Spider-Man, the Magnificent Bastards, and the American Combat Sniper|url=https://archive.org/details/triggermenshadow0000halb|url-access=registration|access-date=12 July 2013|date=18 March 2008|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-35472-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/triggermenshadow0000halb/page/29 29]}}</ref><ref name="Pegler2011">{{cite book|author=Martin Pegler|title=Out of Nowhere: A history of the military sniper, from the Sharpshooter to Afghanistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=COCIaPM2_ksC&pg=PA21|access-date=12 July 2013|date=20 September 2011|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84908-875-6|page=21}}</ref>

Historically, captured snipers are often [[summary execution|summarily executed]]. This happened during [[World War I]]<ref name="firstworldwar.com">{{cite web |date= 22 August 2009 |url = http://www.firstworldwar.com/atoz/snipers.htm|title = Encyclopedia – Snipers|publisher = firstworldwar.com| access-date=10 May 2010 | last=Duffy| first= Michael }}</ref> and [[World War II]];<ref name="theregister.co.uk.2008.11.28">{{cite web |date= 28 November 2008|url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/11/28/sniper_feature/page2.html|title = Snipers – Cowardly assassins, or surgical soldiers?|website = The Register| access-date=10 May 2010 | last=Page | first= Lewis }}</ref> for example the second [[Biscari massacre#Compton Incident|Biscari Massacre]] when 36 suspected snipers were lined up and shot on 14 July 1943.

As a result, if a sniper is in imminent danger of capture, he may discard any items (sniper rifle, laser rangefinder, etc.) which might indicate his status as a sniper. The risk of captured snipers being summarily executed is explicitly referred to in Chapter 6 of US Army doctrine document FM 3-060.11 entitled "SNIPER AND COUNTERSNIPER TACTICS, TECHNIQUES, AND PROCEDURES":

{{quote|Historically, units that suffered heavy and continual casualties from urban sniper fire and were frustrated by their inability to strike back effectively often have become enraged. Such units may overreact and violate the laws of land warfare concerning the treatment of captured snipers. This tendency is magnified if the unit has been under the intense stress of urban combat for an extended time. It is vital that commanders and leaders at all levels understand the law of land warfare and understand the psychological pressures of urban warfare. It requires strong leadership and great moral strength to prevent soldiers from releasing their anger and frustration on captured snipers or civilians suspected of sniping at them.<ref name="http://www.globalsecurity.org.countersniper">{{cite web |date=27 April 2005|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-06-11/ch6.htm|title = Sniper and countersniper tactics, techniques, and procedures|publisher = [[GlobalSecurity.org]]| access-date=10 May 2010 }}</ref>|}}

The negative reputation and perception of snipers can be traced back to the [[American Revolution]], when American "Marksmen" intentionally targeted British officers, an act considered uncivilized by the British Army at the time (this reputation was cemented during the [[Battle of Saratoga]], when [[Benedict Arnold]] allegedly ordered his marksmen to target British General [[Simon Fraser of Balnain (general)|Simon Fraser]], an act that won the battle and French support).<ref name="Senich p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}} The British side used specially selected sharpshooters as well, often German mercenaries.<ref name="Senich p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

To demoralize enemy troops, snipers can follow predictable patterns. During the [[26th of July Movement]] in the [[Cuban Revolution]], the revolutionaries led by [[Fidel Castro]] always killed the foremost man in a group of President [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]]'s soldiers.{{Verify source|date=October 2008}} Realizing this, none of Batista's men would walk first, as it was suicidal. This effectively decreased the army's willingness to search for rebel bases in the mountains. An alternative approach to this psychological process is to kill the second man in the row, leading to the psychological effect of nobody wanting to follow the "leader".

===Counter-sniper tactics===
{{Main|Counter-sniper tactics}}

The occurrence of sniper warfare has led to the evolution of many counter-sniper tactics in modern military strategies. These aim to reduce the damage caused by a sniper to an army, which can often be harmful to both combat capabilities and morale.

The risk of damage to a chain of command can be reduced by removing or concealing features that would otherwise indicate an officer's rank. Modern armies tend to avoid saluting officers in the field, and eliminate rank insignia on [[battle dress uniform]]s (BDU). Officers can seek maximum cover before revealing themselves as good candidates for elimination through actions such as reading maps or using radios.

Friendly snipers can be used to hunt the enemy sniper. Besides direct observation, defending forces can use other techniques. These include calculating the trajectory of a bullet by [[triangulation]]. Traditionally, triangulation of a sniper's position was done manually, though radar-based technology has recently become available. Once located, the defenders can attempt to approach the sniper from cover and overwhelm them. The United States military is funding a project known as RedOwl (Robot Enhanced Detection Outpost With Lasers), which uses laser and acoustic sensors to determine the exact direction from which a sniper round has been fired.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2005/10/04/robotic_vacuum_maker_bu_team_up_on_antisniper_device/ |title=Robotic-vacuum maker, BU team up on anti-sniper device
|first=Hiawatha | last=Bray|work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=4 October 2005 }}</ref>

The more rounds fired by a sniper, the greater the chance the target has of locating him. Thus, attempts to draw fire are often made, sometimes by offering a helmet slightly out of concealment, a tactic successfully employed in the [[Winter War]] by the Finns known as "Kylmä-Kalle" (Cold Charlie).<ref>Petri Sarjanen (1998). Valkoinen kuolema: Talvisodan legendaarisen tarkka-ampujan Simo Häyhän tarina. {{ISBN|952-5170-05-5}}</ref> They used a shop mannequin or other doll dressed as a tempting target, such as an officer. The doll was then presented as if it were a real man sloppily covering himself. Usually, Soviet snipers were unable to resist the temptation of an apparently easy kill. Once the angle where the bullet came from was determined, a large caliber gun, such as a [[Lahti L-39]] "Norsupyssy" ("Elephant rifle") anti-tank rifle was fired at the sniper to kill him.

Other tactics include directing [[artillery]] or [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] fire onto suspected sniper positions, the use of [[smoke screen]]s, placing [[tripwire]]-operated munitions, [[Land mine|mines]], or other [[booby-trap]]s near suspected sniper positions. Even dummy trip-wires can be placed to hamper sniper movement. If anti-personnel mines are unavailable, it is possible to improvise booby-traps by connecting trip-wires to [[hand grenade]]s, [[smoke grenade]]s or [[flare]]s. Though these may not kill a sniper, they will reveal their location. Booby-trap devices can be placed near likely sniper hides, or along the probable routes to and from positions. Knowledge of sniper field-craft will assist in this task.

The use of [[Dog|canine]] units had been very successful, especially during the Vietnam War.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.k9history.com/history-vietnam-1960-1975.htm|title=K-9 History: Vietnam, 1960 – 1975|website=www.k9history.com|access-date=10 November 2017|archive-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114020048/http://www.k9history.com/history-vietnam-1960-1975.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Irregular and asymmetric warfare==
{{Main|Irregular warfare|Asymmetric warfare}}
[[File:Georgian sniper during South Ossetia war.jpg|right|thumb|A Georgian sniper in the [[Georgian-Ossetian conflict]] (2004)]]

The use of sniping (in the sense of shooting at relatively long range from a concealed position) to murder came to public attention in a number of sensational U.S. criminal cases, including the [[University of Texas tower shooting|Austin sniper incident]] of 1966 ([[Charles Whitman]]), the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]] (Lee Harvey Oswald), and the [[Beltway sniper attacks]] of late 2002 (Lee Boyd Malvo). However, these incidents usually do not involve the range or skill of military snipers; in all three cases the perpetrators had U.S. military training, but in other specialties. News reports will often (inaccurately) use the term sniper to describe anyone shooting with a rifle at another person.<ref name="Dockery2007">{{cite book|last=Dockery|first=Kevin|author-link=Kevin Dockery (author)|title=Stalkers and Shooters: A History of Snipers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nYWZFOKFQ2gC&pg=PT170|access-date=12 July 2013|date=3 July 2007|publisher=Penguin Group US|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4406-2890-0|pages=170–171}}</ref>

Sniping has been used in asymmetric warfare situations, for example in the [[Northern Ireland]] [[The Troubles|Troubles]], where in 1972, the bloodiest year of the conflict, the majority of the soldiers killed were shot by concealed [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] riflemen.<ref name="Taylor p. 132">{{harvnb|Taylor|1997|p=132}} – "In 1971, the Provisional IRA shot dead forty-two British soldiers. In 1972, this figure rose to sixty-four, most of them killed by snipers."</ref> There were some instances in the early 1990s of British soldiers and [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] personnel being shot with .50 caliber Barrett rifles by sniper teams collectively known as the [[South Armagh Sniper (1990–1997)|South Armagh sniper]].<ref>Jackson,

The sniper is particularly suited to combat environments where one side is at a disadvantage. A careful sniping strategy can use a few individuals and resources to thwart the movement or other progress of a much better equipped or larger force. Sniping enables a few persons to instil terror in a much larger regular force – regardless of the size of the force the snipers are attached to. It is widely accepted that sniping, while effective in specific instances, is much more effective as a broadly deployed psychological attack or as a force-multiplier.<ref name="RobertsSasser2004">{{cite book|author1=Craig Roberts|author2=Charles W.

Snipers are less likely to be treated mercifully than non-snipers if captured by the enemy.<ref name="theregister.co.uk.2008.11.28"/> The rationale for this is that ordinary soldiers shoot at each other at 'equal opportunity' whilst snipers take their time in tracking and killing individual targets in a methodical fashion with a relatively low risk of retaliation.

===War in Iraq===
{{Main|Iraq War}}

In 2003, the U.S.-led multinational coalition composed of primarily U.S. and UK troops occupied Iraq and attempted to establish a new government in the country. However, shortly after the initial invasion, violence against coalition forces and among various sectarian groups led to asymmetric warfare with the Iraqi insurgency and civil war between many Sunni and Shia Iraqis.

[[File:Sergeant H.A. Marshall of the Sniper Section, The Calgary Highlanders.jpg|thumb|right|Sergeant [[Harold Marshall (Canadian sniper)|H.A. Marshall]] of [[The Calgary Highlanders]]. Canadian snipers in the [[Second World War]] were trained scouts. Specialized equipment includes [[Lee–Enfield]] No. 4 Mk I(T) rifle and scope combination and a camouflaged [[Denison smock]]. PAC Photo, by Ken Bell (September 1944).]]

Even before [[firearm]]s were available, soldiers such as [[Archery|archers]] were specially trained as elite marksmen.

===17th century===
* [[Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke|Lord Brooke]], who represented the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] in the [[English Civil War]], was the first recorded British sniper victim, killed by a Royalist soldier hiding in a bell tower in [[Lichfield]].

===18th century===
* [[Timothy Murphy (sniper)|Timothy Murphy]] ([[American Revolutionary War]]) – killed British General [[General Simon Fraser of Balnian|Simon Fraser]] during the pivotal [[Battle of Saratoga]], hampering the British advance which helped cause them to lose the battle.<ref name="Senich p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}
* [[Patrick Ferguson]] ([[American Revolutionary War]]) – developer of the world's first breech-loaded military rifle (which advanced sniping and sharpshooting tactics), fought with his Corps of Riflemen (recruited from the 6th and 14th Foot) at the [[Battle of Brandywine]], where he may have passed up a chance to shoot George Washington.<ref name="Plaster pp. 39-45, 53-55">{{harvnb|Plaster|2007|pp=39–45, 53–55.}}</ref>

===19th century===
* [[Napoleonic Wars]] – Use of Marine sharpshooters in the mast tops was common usage in navies of the period, and Admiral Nelson's death at Trafalgar is attributed to the actions of French sharpshooters. The British Army developed the concept of directed fire (as opposed to massive unaimed volleys) and formed Rifle regiments, notably the 95th and the 60th who wore green jackets instead of the usual redcoats. Fighting as [[Skirmisher]]s, usually in pairs and trusted to choose their own targets, they wrought havoc amongst the French during the [[Peninsular War]].
* British [[Rifleman Thomas Plunkett]] (Peninsular War) – shot French General [[Auguste-Marie-François Colbert|Colbert]] and one of his aides at a range of between {{convert|200|and|600|m|yd|0}} using a [[Baker rifle]].<ref>Stuart Hadaway ''[http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/biographies/c_plunkett.html Rifleman Thomas Plunkett: 'A Pattern for the Battalion.']''</ref>
* Colonel [[Hiram Berdan]] ([[American Civil War]]) – commanded 1st and 2nd US Sharpshooters, who were trained and equipped Union marksmen with the .52 caliber [[Sharps Rifle]]. It has been claimed that Berdan's units killed more enemies than any other in the [[Union Army]].<ref name="Senich p. "/>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}

* During the American Civil War, an unidentified Confederate sniper shot Major General [[John Sedgwick]] during the [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House]] probably with a British [[Joseph Whitworth|Whitworth]] target rifle at the then-incredible distance of minimum {{convert|730|m|yd|0}}. Ben Powell of the 12th South Carolina claimed credit, although his account has been discounted because the general he shot at with a Whitworth rifled musket was mounted, probably Brig Gen. William H.
