'''Flanders and Swann''' were a British [[comedy duo]]. Lyricist, actor and singer [[Michael Flanders]] (1922–1975) and composer and pianist [[Donald Swann]] (1923–1994) collaborated in writing and performing [[comedy music|comic songs]]. They first worked together in a school revue in 1939 and eventually wrote more than 100 comic songs together.<ref name="Music">{{cite book| first= Paul| last= Du Noyer| year= 2003| title= The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music| edition= 1st | publisher= Flame Tree Publishing | location= Fulham, London| isbn= 1-904041-96-5| page= 421}}</ref>

Between 1956 and 1967, Flanders and Swann performed their songs, interspersed with comic monologues, in their long-running two-man [[revue]]s ''[[At the Drop of a Hat]]'' and ''[[At the Drop of Another Hat]]'', which they toured in Britain and abroad. Both revues were recorded in concert (by [[George Martin]]), and the duo also made several studio recordings.

==Musical partnership==
Flanders and Swann both attended [[Westminster School]] (where in July and August 1940 they staged a revue called ''Go To It'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.donaldswann.co.uk/hatshow.html|title=Hat Shows|website=Donaldswann.co.uk|access-date=3 September 2019}}</ref> and [[Christ Church, Oxford]], two institutions linked by ancient tradition. The pair went their separate ways during [[World War II]], but a chance meeting in 1948 led to a musical partnership writing songs and [[light opera]], Flanders providing the words and Swann composing the music. Their songs have been sung by performers such as [[Ian Wallace (singer)|Ian Wallace]] and [[Joyce Grenfell]].

In December 1956, Flanders and Swann hired the New Lindsey Theatre, [[Notting Hill]], to perform their own two-man revue ''At the Drop of a Hat'', which opened on New Year's Eve.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=470}}</ref> Flanders sang a selection of the songs that they had written, interspersed with comic monologues, accompanied by Swann on the piano. An unusual feature of their act was that both men remained seated for their shows: Swann behind his piano and Flanders in a wheelchair (having contracted [[poliomyelitis]] in 1943).<ref name="Larkin"/> The show was successful and transferred the next month to the [[Fortune Theatre]], where it ran for over two years, before touring in the UK, the United States, Canada and Switzerland.<ref name="Larkin"/>

In 1963, Flanders and Swann opened in a second revue, ''At the Drop of Another Hat'', at the [[Haymarket Theatre]].<ref name="Larkin"/> Over the next four years they toured a combination of the two shows in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, [[Hong Kong]], the United States and Canada, before finishing at the [[Booth Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. On 9 April 1967, they performed their last live show together.<ref name="Larkin"/> Ten days later, they moved into a studio and recorded the show for television.

Over the course of 11 years, Flanders and Swann gave nearly 2,000 live performances. Although their performing partnership ended in 1967, they remained friends afterwards and collaborated on occasional projects.

== Songs ==
Flanders and Swann's songs are characterised by wit, gentle satire, complex rhyming schemes, and memorable choruses. Flanders commented during the recorded performance of ''At the Drop of Another Hat'',
{{quote|The purpose of satire, it has been rightly said, is to strip off the veneer of comforting illusion and cosy half-truth.  And our job, as I see it, is to put it back again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iankitching.me.uk/humour/hippo/|title=Michael Flanders and Donald Swann|website=Iankitching.me.uk|access-date=17 April 2009|date=13 August 1995}}</ref>}}

They wrote over a hundred comic songs together.  The following selection gives an indication of their range.
{{unordered list
| "All Gall"—a political satire based on the long career of [[Charles de Gaulle]]. At the time of writing, de Gaulle had recently vetoed the UK's first application to join the [[European Economic Community]]. Sung to the tune of "[[This Old Man]]".
| "Bedstead Men", a wry explanation for the rusty bedsteads dumped in ponds and lakes in the UK, including a witty reference to "A Smuggler's Song" by [[Rudyard Kipling]] in which "Bedstead Men" are substituted for "Gentlemen".
| "First and Second Law"—a jazzy setting of the first and second laws of [[thermodynamics]]. "Heat is work and work is heat..." "Heat won't pass from a cooler to a hotter / You can try it if you like but you far better notter / Cos the cold in the cooler will get hotter as a ruler..." "Heat is work and work's a curse / And all the heat in the universe / is gonna cool down / because it can't increase / so there'll be no more work / and there'll be perfect peace" / [Swann] "Really?" / [Flanders] "Yeah, that's entropy, man." 
| "The Gasman Cometh"—a verse-and-chorus song in which a householder finds that no tradesman ever completes a job without creating another, related job for another tradesman. The melody quotes from "[[Dashing Away with the Smoothing Iron]]".<ref>{{cite web|title=Dashing Away with a Smoothing Iron by Traditional|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=11509|website=Songfacts.com|access-date=13 April 2013}}</ref> The title may have been inspired by that of ''[[The Iceman Cometh]]'' (1946).
| "The Hippopotamus"—one of Flanders and Swann's best-known songs (because of its memorable chorus, "Mud, mud, glorious mud"), and one of a range of songs that they wrote about different beasts, including:{{unordered list
  | "[[The Gnu]]", 
  | "The Rhinoceros",
  | "The Warthog" (both with the message that beauty is only skin deep)
  | "The Armadillo". 
  | "The Sloth"}}
"The Hippopotamus" is among those [[Ian Wallace (singer)|Ian Wallace]] included in his repertoire.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/ian-wallace-bass-baritone-celebrated-for-his-buffo-roles-ndash-and-for-his-rendition-of-the-hippopotamus-song-1802618.html "Ian Wallace: Bass baritone celebrated for his 'buffo' roles – and for his rendition of 'The Hippopotamus Song'"], ''The Independent'', 15 October 2009, accessed 26 December 2019</ref>
| "Ill Wind"—Flanders's words sung to a slightly cut version, with cadenza, of the ''rondo'' finale of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] [[Horn Concerto No. 4 (Mozart)|Horn Concerto No. 4 in E flat major]], K.&nbsp;495. It has to be sung since Flanders's French horn was apparently stolen.
| "Rockall" – deriding the British annexation of the island of [[Rockall]] in 1955.
| "In The Desert" ("''Верблюды''", ''lit.'' "[[camel]]s")—a "traditional Russian" song, performed by Donald Swann. He provides an [[English language|English-language]] translation after every line. The haunting music and poignant lyrics are undercut by the dry unemotional tone in which Swann gives the translation. Some of the original words are repetitive, rendering parts of the translation redundant.
| "In the D'Oyly Cart"—a satire about the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]]. It was first performed in the revue ''Oranges and Lemons'' (1948) and revived in ''Penny Plain'' (1951). It was included as the first track on Flanders and Swann's 1974 album, ''And Then We Wrote''.<ref>Shepherd, Marc. [http://gasdisc.oakapplepress.com/mdflaswa.htm "Flanders & Swann's "In the D'Oyly Cart" (1974)"], ''A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography'' (1999)</ref>
| "[[Have Some Madeira M'Dear]]"—an old [[roué]] sings to an [[Ingenue (stock character)|ingénue]] about the merits of that wine, hinting that he has seduction in mind, with complex word-play, including three oft-quoted examples of [[syllepsis]].
| "Holimakittiloukachichichi"—another (short) song of implied seduction, this time in the kingdom of Tonga, where the word means "no".
| "Misalliance"—a political allegory concerning a love affair between a [[honeysuckle]] and a [[bindweed]].
| "P** P* B**** B** D******" or "Pee Po Belly Bum Drawers"—a song comparing the use of profanity among the intelligentsia to playground swearing.
| "The Reluctant Cannibal"—an argument between father and son, on the topic of cannibalism. (Son: "Eating people is wrong", Father: "Must have been someone he ate"—"he used to be a regular anthropopha''guy''") The father says you might as well say "Don't fight people" and they agree: "Ridiculous!" (Swann had registered as a conscientious objector during World War II and served with the [[Friends' Ambulance Unit]].)<ref>{{cite news|last=Amis|first=John|title=Obituary: Donald Swann|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-donald-swann-1431432.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|access-date=26 April 2012|date=25 March 1994}}</ref>
| "[[Slow Train (Flanders and Swann song)|Slow Train]]"—an elegiac song about the railway stations on lines scheduled for closure by the [[Beeching Axe]] in 1963. {{anchor|A Song of Patriotic Prejudice}}
| "A Song of Patriotic Prejudice"—a parody of patriotic songs ("The English, the English, the English are best/I wouldn't give tuppence for all of the rest")
| "A Song of Reproduction"—about the then topical mania for do-it-yourself [[High fidelity|hi-fi]] as an end in itself. (Making much of the jargon of the hobby: "woofer", "tweeter", "wow on your top", "flutter on your bottom" and in a line added for the stereo remake: "If you raise the ceiling four feet, put the fireplace from that wall to that wall, you'll still only get the stereophonic effect if you sit in the bottom of that cupboard.") The closing verse references singers who were not necessarily in the contemporary public consciousness, [[Enrico Caruso]] having died in 1921 - "With a tone control at a single touch/ I can make a [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]] sound like [[Leslie Hutchinson|Hutch]]".
| "A Song of the Weather"—a parody of the 1834 poem "January Brings the Snow" by [[Sara Coleridge]]
| "There's a Hole in My Budget", a parody of [[There's a Hole in My Bucket]] in the form of a dialogue between the then Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] and the Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Denis Healey]].
| "To Kokoraki" (''Το Κοκοράκι'', ''lit.'' "The Cockerel")—a modern-Greek children's song, something like "[[Old McDonald Had a Farm]]", in which a different animal noise is added in each verse. Flanders, feigning impatience with it as Swann sings several more verses than strictly necessary, remarks sarcastically "We must have it in full some night. Alternate it with ''[[The Ring Cycle]]''."
| "A Transport of Delight"—with an increasing refrain about the "Big six-wheeler, scarlet-painted, [[London Transport Board|London Transport]], diesel-engined, ninety-seven–horse-power omnibus".
| "20 Tons of TNT"—a song in protest against [[thermonuclear weapon]]s.
| "The War of 14–18"—a translation of a [[French language|French]] song by [[Georges Brassens]], this song celebrates (satirically) [[World War I]].
| "The Whale (Mopy Dick)", which demonstrates Swann's expertise in [[musical parody]]: it deftly parodies the style of the English [[Fantasia on British Sea Songs|Sea-Song]] popular in the early 20th century. 
| "The Wompom"—a tale about a fictitious all-purpose plant each of whose parts is an excellent raw material of a different kind.
| "Twosome: Kang & Jag" (Kangaroo and Jaguar)—two more animal songs sung as a pair. The title recalls two operas "''Cav'' and ''Pag''" (i.e. ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' and ''[[Pagliacci]]'') which are often performed together.}}

A very rare song, "Vendor Librorum Floreat" (Let the bookseller flourish), was released as a single in 1960. It was written for the annual American Booksellers Association, the only known time Flanders & Swann accepted a private commission.

== Monologues ==
Flanders' comic monologues include:
* "By Air"—about the vogue for air travel. "I agree with the old lady who said, 'If God had intended us to fly, He would never have given us the railways.{{'"}}
* "Tried by the Centre Court"—a [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] match between Miss L. Hammerfest and [[Joan Jackson|Miss Joan Hunter-Dunn]], as told by an exasperated umpire. "They are bashing a ball with the gut of a cat".
* "Greensleeves"—about the background to the composition of the [[Greensleeves|famous English air]]. An annotated version, explaining all the jokes, is available online.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.beachmedia.com/gorbuduc.shtml|title=The Greensleeves Monologue annotated|website=Beachmedia.com|access-date=21 September 2010}}</ref>
* ''Los Olividados''— a satire on [[bullfighting]], about "the almost unbearable drama of a corrida d'olivas, or festival of olive-stuffing". "A cruel sport: some may think it so. But this is surely more than a sport, this is more than a vital artform. What we have experienced here today is total catharsis, in the acting out of that primeval drama, of man pitted against the olive." The title is a reference to ''[[Los Olvidados]]'', or ''The Forgotten Ones'', a 1950 movie by the director [[Luis Buñuel]].
* "Built-up Area"—a prehistoric inhabitant of [[Salisbury Plain]] complains about a new development: [[Stonehenge]].

==Homage and parody==
The British comedy [[double act]] [[Armstrong and Miller (comedians)|Armstrong & Miller]] have a recurring sketch on ''[[The Armstrong and Miller Show]]'' in which they parody Flanders and Swann, as Donald Brabbins (Armstrong as Flanders) and Teddy Fyffe (Miller as Swann). The parodies begin like a typical Flanders and Swann performance, but the songs are far more [[bawdy]], often being mock-censored for comedic effect.<ref>{{cite news |last=Davies | first=Serena | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3668664/The-Armstrong-and-Miller-Show.html | title=The Armstrong & Miller Show | newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=20 October 2007 | access-date=7 November 2012}}</ref>

British singer-songwriter [[Frank Turner]] covered "The Armadillo" in his "Mittens" EP.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://frank-turner.com/discography/mittens-ep/ | title = Mittens EP | website=Frank-turner.com | access-date=3 July 2019 }}</ref>
