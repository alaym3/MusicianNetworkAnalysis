==History==
===Formation and early releases (2003–2008)===
The Amity Affliction formed in Gympie, a South-East Queensland town in Australia by friends Ahren Stringer, Joseph Lilwall and Troy Brady in their final year of high school. The band was named for a close friend of the band, who died in a car accident at the age of 17. 'Amity' referred to the friendship and 'Affliction' was to indicate the struggle which dealing with the death caused the band members.
Whilst still at High School, the band spent many times playing at school concerts and lunch breaks.

In 2004, The Amity Affliction released a three track self-titled demo produced by Scott Mullane at Aisle 6 Recording. At the time there were four members with former members Garth Buchanan on bass and Lachlan Faulkner on drums. 
In late 2004, vocalist Joel Birch joined the band. Following, mid-2005, The Amity Affliction released their debut self-titled EP. After the release of the EP they toured the East Coast on their 2005 East Coast Tour.

In 2007, there was a line up change when Lachlan Faulkner quit and Garth Buchanan left to join [[Behind Crimson Eyes]]. Lachlan Faulkner later joined Saint Lucia. They then hired drummer, Troels Thomasson, Chris Burt on guitar (originally on bass), Ahren Stringer now on bass and the addition of a keyboardist, Trad Nathan. The Amity Affliction released a new five track EP entitled ''[[High Hopes (EP)|High Hopes]]'' which was named for the house in which ''The Amityville Horror'' took place. The first pressing came in a CD/DVD package. The DVD featured the band discussing the recording of the EP, it also featured the band on the road and performing.

===''Severed Ties'' (2008–2010)===
The band released their debut [[studio album]] in 2008, entitled ''[[Severed Ties]]''. The album spent a week on the [[ARIA Charts|Australian Albums Chart]] at number 26.<ref name="severed">{{cite web|author=Steffen Hung |url=http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=The+Amity+Affliction&titel=Severed+Ties&cat=a |title=The Amity Affliction - Severed Ties |publisher=australian-charts.com |access-date=1 May 2010}}</ref>

It is the first album to feature Chris Burt's brother Ryan Burt on drums. The album features guest vocals from [[Michael Crafter]] of [[I Killed the Prom Queen]]/Confession, Matthew Wright of [[the Getaway Plan]], JJ Peters of I Killed the Prom Queen/[[Deez Nuts (band)|Deez Nuts]]/Grips 'N' Tonic, Helmet Roberts and Lochlan Watt (Nuclear Summer).

His last show was in London in December 2009. While all the members are still good friends with Chris, the decision was made in the best interest of the band musically. Chris now plays guitar and sings in Brisbane based band SENSaii. Afterwards, Clint Ellis (Splattering) from the Getaway Plan took his place.<ref name="killyourstereo.com"/>

In April 2010, the band flew out to New York to record their second full-length record with producer Machine. On 10 May, the band uploaded a new song from this album, "I Hate Hartley" on their MySpace and the song was later available for free download.

On a pushed-forward date on 18 June as announced on their website (originally 25 June 2010), the band released their second studio album ''Youngbloods'' on Boomtown and Shock Records. The album was a huge success for the band, receiving critical acclaim and debuting at number 6 on the ARIA charts.

==Controversy==
Shortly after the announcement of the ''[[Chasing Ghosts (album)|Chasing Ghosts]]'' album, the album's cover was revealed. The cover depicts a man hanging from a tree who is thought to have committed suicide. The graphic nature of this image caused much controversy among social media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://themusic.com.au/news/all/2012/06/11/amity-affliction-statements/|title=/|website=The Music|access-date=2 October 2020}}</ref> The situation was very ironic due to the main message behind the album being anti-suicide and urging fans who feel suicidal to turn to people close to them and seeking help rather than taking their own life.<ref name="auto"/> The band later apologized for the artwork along with the responses band members made to fans regarding the artwork. Later uses of the cover art would remove the hanging man.

Slight controversy sparked during the [[Warped Tour]] 2013, when in the middle of a set Joel Birch called out the frontman of [[Memphis May Fire]], [[Matty Mullins]], on supposed sexist comments that had been made to female attendance at Warped.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theprp.com/2013/07/16/news/the-amity-affliction-vocalist-calls-out-memphis-may-fires-matty-mullins-at-vans-warped-tour/|title=The Amity Affliction Vocalist Calls Out Memphis May Fire's Matty Mullins At 'Vans Warped Tour' |website=Theprp.com|date=16 July 2013}}</ref> The frontman then went on to continue talking about racist taunts that had been made towards the band's replacement drummer/percussionist for the tour, Chad Hasty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/amity-affliction-frontman-calls-out-memphis-may-fire-vocalist-onstage-at-warped/|title=Amity Affliction Frontman Calls Out Memphis May Fire Vocalist Onstage at Warped |website=Musicfeeds.com.au|date=15 July 2013}}</ref>
