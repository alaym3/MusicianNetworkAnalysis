'''The Fisherman's Friends''' are a [[folk music]] group from [[Port Isaac]], [[Cornwall]], who sing [[sea shanties]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Strange-News/Fishermans-Friends-Cornish-Fishermen-Net-Catchy-Recording-Contract/Article/201003315575736?lpos=Strange_News_Second_UK_News_Article_Teaser_Region_2&lid=ARTICLE_15575736_Fishermans_Friends%3A_Cornish_Fishermen_Net_Catchy_Recording_Contract|title=Fisherman's Friends Net Catchy Album Deal|last=Sinclair|first=Lulu|date=18 March 2010|publisher=[[Sky News]]|access-date=5 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322210459/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Strange-News/Fishermans-Friends-Cornish-Fishermen-Net-Catchy-Recording-Contract/Article/201003315575736?lpos=Strange_News_Second_UK_News_Article_Teaser_Region_2&lid=ARTICLE_15575736_Fishermans_Friends%3A_Cornish_Fishermen_Net_Catchy_Recording_Contract|archive-date=22 March 2010}}</ref> They have been performing locally since 1995, and signed a record deal with [[Universal Music]] in March 2010.  Whilst essentially an [[a cappella]] group, their studio recordings and live performances now often include traditional simple  instrumentation.

==History==
The Fisherman's Friends' performances combine traditional songs of the sea with more contemporary folk music and a large dash of humour. 

The current members are brothers John and Jeremy Brown, John Lethbridge, Jason Nicholas, Toby Lobb, John McDonnell, and Jon Cleave. 

In the original line-up, all of the members of the group "grew up within half a mile of Port Isaac harbour" except for John McDonnell who is a Yorkshireman.{{cn|date=June 2021}} Three were fishermen, and the others were linked to the sea through service as coastguards or lifeboatmen. Peter Rowe was the oldest founding member. He died in January 2021 at the age of 88.<ref>[https://www.falmouthpacket.co.uk/news/18993692.peter-rowe-fishermans-friends-founder-dies/ Peter Rowe Fisherman's Friends founder dies]</ref>

In 2009 [[BBC Radio]] presenter [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker]] was in Cornwall on holiday and came across two of their homemade CDs. Walker's manager, Ian Brown, travelled to Port Isaac and negotiated a recording contract worth £1 million for them with [[Universal Music Group]], who released their first commercial album the following year.<ref name="gua2019">{{cite web |last1=Thorpe |first1=Vanessa |title=Fisherman's Friends: behind feelgood film of Cornwall's folk stars lies a tragedy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/18/fishermans-friends-tragedy-behind-feelgood-film |website=The Guardian |access-date=16 March 2019}}</ref>

Jon Cleave is one of the MCs of the group and also the author/illustrator of the children's book series ''Gully''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegullery.co.uk/ |title=Gully the Seagull Children's Story Books &#124; Port Isaac Cornwall &#124; Home Page |publisher=Thegullery.co.uk |access-date=2015-11-03}}</ref> as well as the full length, humorous novel ''Nasty Pasty''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nastypasty.info/ |title=Nasty Pasty the first novel by Jon Cleave from The Fisherman's Friends |publisher=Nastypasty.info |access-date=2015-11-03}}</ref>

They sing the chorus on [[Show of Hands]]' song "Cousin Jack" and the title track of Show of Hands' "best of" CD ''Roots''.

===Repertoire===
Their repertoire includes both shanties and other nautical songs, some of which are fairly lewd.<ref>{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Murphy |title=When the boat came in |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/7638223/Fishermans-Friends-when-the-boat-came-in.html |work=The Telegraph |date=29 April 2010 |access-date=2011-02-07 |location=London}}</ref>

With the addition of Nicholas and Lobb (accordion and guitar) to the founding members of the group, they have included musical accompaniment in their performances. Lobb and former member Hawkins are both supported by Vintage Guitars and regularly use their instruments on stage. 

===Notable performances===
The group performed at the 2010 [[Cornbury Park|Cornbury]] music festival in Oxfordshire,<ref>{{cite web|first=Ben |last=Parkinson |url=http://www.virtualfestivals.com/latest/news/7616 |title=Fisherman's Friends for Cornbury Festival |publisher=Virtual Festivals |date=23 April 2010 |access-date=2011-02-07}}</ref> the [[Glastonbury Festival]] on several occasions, typically on the Acoustic Stage, but on one occasion performing on the Pyramid Stage, and the [[Cambridge Folk Festival]].<ref name="Gifford" /> The band have also appeared at Towersey Festival, Wickham Festival, Beautiful days, Costa Del Folk, Shrewsbury Folk Festival, Tunes in the Dunes, Boardmasters and Celtic Connections, among others. 

Because they are semi-professional, the band do not tour extensively, but usually embark on short tours in November and February/March. They also regularly perform in Port Isaac, singing on the platt (beach) in the summer for charity.

===Recordings===
The group released three CDs themselves before signing with Universal. In 2002, under the name Port Isaac's 'Fishermen's Friends', they recorded an album, primarily to raise funds for the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]], which was released on the Clovelly label (#CLCD12702). The album, titled ''Fishermen's Friends Are Home from the Sea'', has 20 tracks and was recorded in St Peter's Church, Port Isaac, on the 26 and 27 April 2002. All the tracks are sung in the traditional a cappella style. The album was engineered by Bob Whitney and produced by John Perkins. Their first album with Universal, ''Port Isaac's Fisherman's Friends'', was recorded in [[St Kew]] Parish Church, Cornwall,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/8572962.stm |title=Cornwall singers win deal to make album of sea shanties|work=BBC News|date=18 March 2010 |access-date=2011-02-07}}</ref> and released in April 2010.<ref name="Gifford">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/ship-comes-in-at-last-for-cornish-folk-singers-2206359.html |title=Ship comes in at last for Cornish folk singers |first=Ralph |last=Gifford |date=7 February 2011 |work=The Independent |access-date=2001-02-07 |location=London}}</ref>

In 2010 they re-recorded their single, "No Hopers, Jokers or Rogues", with new lyrics, in support of England's [[FIFA World Cup]] campaign in South Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westbriton.co.uk/fishing-net/story-11517658-detail/story.html#ixzz3bVHRwlbm |title=Back of the fishing net as Fisherman's Friends record World Cup single |publisher=West Briton |date=2010-06-10 |access-date=2015-11-03}}</ref>

A second album with Universal, ''One and All'', was released on 26 August 2013.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/the-fishermans-friends-dedicate-new-album-one-and-all-to-tenor-trevor-grills-who-died-in-freak-accident-8672396.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Matilda | last=Battersby | title=The Fisherman's Friends dedicate new album One and All to tenor Trevor Grills who died in freak accident | date=25 June 2013}}</ref> The single "Mary Anne", taken from the album, was released on 25 June 2013.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-23031116 | work=BBC News | title=Fisherman's Friends release Trevor Grills memorial single | date=25 June 2013}}</ref>

In July 2015 the album ''Proper Job'' was released on the [[Sony Music]] label, in association with the [[St Austell Brewery]], who brew a beer of the same name. This album also saw the first appearance of new member Toby Lobb.<ref name="properjob">{{cite news|last1=Butler|first1=Jackie|title=Fisherman's Friends new album is a Proper Job|url=http://www.cornishguardian.co.uk/Fisherman-s-Friends-new-album-Proper-Job/story-26870496-detail/story.html|access-date=27 March 2016|work=Cornish Guardian|date=9 July 2015}}</ref>

In 2018 group released ''Sole Mates'', an album produced by Giles Woolley and band member Toby Lobb. Their aim was to celebrate their history and create a simpler album that represented their live sound more accurately. ''Sole Mates'' comprised tracks that the band had performed during their previous two tours and featured additional instrumentation from Phil Beer from Show of Hands and Emma Murfin from Cornwall-based folk act Black Velvet.

===Television===
[[Gareth Malone]]'s documentary on sea shanties, shown in May 2010 on BBC 4, included a contribution from the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00s97c0|title=Sea Shanties and Sea Songs with Gareth Malone |publisher=BBC |access-date=11 May 2010}}</ref> The Fisherman's Friends have also starred in an advert for fish company, [[Young's Seafood]].

The band have appeared on BBC One's ''The One Show'' on two occasions, been the subject of an ITV1 documentary that charted their early success, a SKY ARTS documentary which featured their performance at the Celtic Connections festival, BBC’s ''Countryfile'' with John Craven and many local news items. 

2018 also saw them feature in the Songs of Praise Christmas Special.

===Feature film===
{{Main|Fisherman's Friends (film)}}

The producers of the film, ''[[Fisherman's Friends (film)|Fisherman's Friends]]'', bought the band's [[life rights]] to be made into a feature film. The writers [[Nick Moorcroft]], Meg Leonard and Piers Ashworth adapted their story for the screen. Principal photography commenced on 30 April 2018 for 5 weeks on location in Port Isaac and London. The film was directed by [[Chris Foggin]] and was released in cinemas nationwide in the UK on 15 March 2019.<ref name="gua2019" />

The film stars an ensemble cast headed by [[James Purefoy]], [[Daniel Mays]] and [[Tuppence Middleton]], with [[David Hayman]], Dave Johns, Noel Clarke, [[Maggie Steed]], Sam Swainsbury and Christian Brassington playing key supporting roles. The film is based around a largely fictional story of Danny, a music industry executive who signs them to a London record label and develops a relationship with one of the band member's daughters, played by Middleton, and covers the period up to their first album release.<ref name="gua2019" />

All members of the band have cameos in the film and, according to Ashworth, "the singing is a blend of the voices of the group themselves and of the actors."<ref name="gua2019" />

In May 2019 a sequel titled ''Fisherman's Friends 2: Bound For South Australia'' was announced which will take them from performing at Glastonbury to struggling to put their second album together.{{cn|date=June 2021}}
