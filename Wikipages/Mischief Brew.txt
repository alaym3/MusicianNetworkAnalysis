'''Mischief Brew''' was an American [[folk punk]] band from [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] consisting of vocalist and guitarist Erik Petersen, bassist Shawn St. Clair, and drummers Christopher Petersen and Christopher Kulp. The band played [[DIY punk ethic|DIY]] [[folk punk]] and [[anarcho-punk]] music; it incorporated styles including [[American folk music|American folk]], [[Celtic music|Celtic folk]], [[Gypsy punk|Gypsy-punk]], and [[Swing jazz|swing]] with lyrics influenced by the [[labour movement]], [[Protest song|protest music]], and [[Punk subculture|punk culture]]. 

It was started by Erik Petersen as a solo project, but eventually grew into a band. Petersen drew inspiration from the protest movements of the 1960s,<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.mischiefbrew.com/wst_page8.html |title=Folk the System |publisher=Mischief Brew |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}</ref> "the idea that [[rebellion]] in music didn't originate in [[punk rock]]" ([[Profane Existence]] No.&nbsp;54, 2007), and [[anti-establishment]] artists like [[Woody Guthrie]] and [[Crass]].<ref name="ReferenceA" /> Petersen's lyrics often pay homage to American labor radicalism of the early 20th century.<ref>Kristen A.

==History==
Mischief Brew started after Erik Petersen's previous band, The Orphans, broke up in 2000. The Orphans were a punk band formed in [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]] in 1995 consisting of Erik Petersen on vocals and guitar, Andrew (Drew) Petersen on vocals and bass, Tom Johnson on guitar, and Andrew Baxter on drums. The group would go on to perform reunion shows in 2004 and 2008.

At first, Mischief Brew consisted of only Petersen on an [[acoustic guitar]] or [[mandolin]], playing songs off of the ''Mirth'' demo. In 2003, Petersen released the ''Bellingham & Philadelphia'' split with [[Robert Blake (folk singer)|Robert Blake]], and the ''Bakenal'' CDEP. After extensive acoustic touring in support of the first two releases, Petersen assembled the first full-band incarnation of Mischief Brew, featuring Chris "Doc" Kulp (of [[Red Devil (punk band)|Red Devil]]) on drums and Sean "Shantz" Yantz (of Evil Robot Us' and Abusing the Word) on bass. In 2005, Petersen released his first full-length, ''[[Smash The Windows]]'', featuring guest spots by artists from [[Leftöver Crack]], [[World/Inferno Friendship Society]], and [[Guignol]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.deadmetaphor.com/artnoise/?p=198 | archive-url=https://archive.today/20051220140604/http://www.deadmetaphor.com/artnoise/?p=198 | url-status=dead | archive-date=2005-12-20 |title = ARTNOISE is punk rock webzine on DM » mischief brew (Erik petersen) /…}}</ref> This release saw him experiment more musically, with styles ranging from gypsy-folk to swing.

The second album was ''Songs From Under the Sink'', a collection of songs written between 1997 and 2002 which stresses his anarchist beliefs and is complemented by his clever guitar melodies. Yantz left the band shortly after ''Songs from Under the Sink'' was released, and was replaced for a few shows by Kevin Holland and later by Shawn St. Clair (of Endless Nightmare, Lost Cause, Stations, the Bad Dudes and Wrought With Sickness), who played bass. Mischief Brew's released ''Photographs from the Shoebox'' in 2008, a split LP/CD with [[Joe Jack Talcum]] of [[The Dead Milkmen]].

In 2009, two versions of the song "Punx Win!" appeared on a split with [[Andrew Jackson Jihad]].  Rather than a traditional 7" single, Pirates Press Records released the record as an [[Unusual types of gramophone records#Parallel grooves|8" with parallel grooves]], therefore able to play either version of the track depending on where the needle is dropped. Petersen and [[Franz Nicolay|Guignol]] collaborated in 2009 on ''Fight Dirty''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/35621 |title=Mischief Brew and Franz Nicolay's Guignol release new collaboration |website=Punknews.org |date=2009-10-16 |accessdate=2016-07-16}}</ref> Mischief Brew released ''[[Stone of madness|The Stone Operation]]'' in May 2011. The previous year, on October 18, 2010, an unmastered track from the album, "Dallas In Romania," was previewed by [[Y-Rock On XPN|Y-Rock on WXPN]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thekey.xpn.org/2010/10/philly-local-philes-upper-darbys-mischief-brew-sings-about-dallas-in-romania/ |title=Philly Local Philes: Upper Darby's Mischief Brew sings about "Dallas In Romania" - The Key |website=Thekey.xpn.org |date=2010-10-18 |accessdate=2016-07-16}}</ref>

Leading up to and following the release of ''This Is Not For Children'', Mischief Brew released three music videos for their songs "O, Pennsyltucky!" (Fistolo, 2014), "City of Black Fridays" (Shibby Pictures, 2015), and "Squatter Envy" (Shibby Pictures, 2016), all three of which appeared on the album.

Mischief Brew have played shows in support of [[Food Not Bombs]], [[Iraq Veterans Against the War]], and [[ABC No Rio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2rP1US8UKo |title=Erik Petersen - Every Town Will Celebrate |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2007-04-06 |accessdate=2016-07-16}}</ref> In October 2011, Petersen played an acoustic set at [[Occupy Philadelphia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://onepeoplesproject.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=887:occupy-north-carolinawashington-dcphiladelphia-the-one-peoples-project-report-part-5&catid=67:occupy-together-news&Itemid=13 |title=OCCUPY NORTH CAROLINA/WASHINGTON, DC/PHILADELPHIA: THE ONE PEOPLE'S PROJECT REPORT, PART 5 |website=Onepeoplesproject.com |date=2011-10-25 |accessdate=2016-07-16}}</ref>
