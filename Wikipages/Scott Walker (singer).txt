==Life and career==
===Early life===
Noel Scott Engel was born on January 9, 1943, in [[Hamilton, Ohio]], US,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://4ad.com/|title=The official website for independent record label 4AD.|website=4AD|language=en|access-date=March 25, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p21307|pure_url=yes}} |title=Overview: Scott Walker |access-date=November 12, 2009 |website=AllMusic}}</ref><ref>Interview in Beat-Club, Radio Bremen, April 26, 1969.</ref> the son of Elizabeth Marie (Fortier), who was from [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada, and Noel Walter Engel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://birth-records.mooseroots.com/l/6596312/Noel-Scott-Eugel |title=Birth Record of Noel Scott Eugel : Born to Noel Walter Eugel and Elizabeth Marie Eugel |website=Mooseroots.com|access-date=January 5, 2017}}</ref> His father was an oil industry manager whose work led the family to successive homes in [[Ohio]], [[Texas]], [[Colorado]] and [[New York (state)|New York]]. Engel and his mother settled in California in 1959. Engel was interested in both music and performance and spent time as a child actor and singer in the mid to late 1950s, including roles in two Broadway musicals, ''[[Pipe Dream (musical)|Pipe Dream]]'' and ''[[Plain and Fancy]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-cast-staff/scotty-engel-94908|title=Scotty Engel – Broadway Cast & Staff |website=IBDb.com}}</ref> Championed by singer and TV host [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]], he appeared several times on Fisher's TV program. Engel cut some records including one named "Misery", which saw him briefly promoted as a [[teen idol]].<ref name="mojojan2013"/><ref name="guardianbrother"/>

Upon his arrival in Los Angeles, Engel had already changed both his taste and his direction. Interested in the [[Cool jazz|progressive jazz]] of [[Stan Kenton]] and [[Bill Evans]], he was also a self-confessed "Continental suit-wearing natural enemy of the Californian surfer"<ref name="mojojan2013"/> and a fan of European cinema (in particular [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Federico Fellini]] and [[Robert Bresson]]) and the [[Beat movement|Beat poets]]. In between attending art school and furthering his interests in cinema and literature, Scott played bass guitar proficiently enough to get session work in Los Angeles as a teenager.<ref name="mojojan2013"/>

In 1961, after playing with [[the Routers]], he met guitarist and singer John Maus,<!-- Do not wikilink this name to the other musician named John Maus who was born in 1980 --> who was using the stage name [[John Walker (musician)|John Walker]] on a fake ID to enable him to perform in clubs while under age. The two formed a band, Judy and the Gents, to back John Walker's sister Judy Maus, before joining other musicians to tour as [[the Surfaris]] (although they did not play on the Surfaris' records). In early 1964, Engel and John Walker began working together as [[the Walker Brothers]], later in the year linking up with drummer [[Gary Leeds]] whose father financed the trio's first trip to the UK.<ref name=walker>{{cite web |url=http://www.john-walker.org/Bio07.htm |title=John Walker biography |website=John-Walker.org |access-date=August 21, 2014}}</ref>

===1964–1967: The Walker Brothers===
{{Main|The Walker Brothers}}
As a trio, the Walker Brothers cultivated a glossy-haired and handsome familial image. Prompted by Maus, each of the members took "Walker" as their stage surname. Scott continued to use the name Walker thereafter, with the brief exception of returning to his birth name for the original release of his fifth solo album ''[[Scott 4]]'', and in songwriting credits. Initially, John served as guitarist and main lead singer of the trio, with Gary on drums and Scott playing bass guitar and mostly singing harmony vocals. By early 1965, the group had made appearances on TV shows ''Hollywood A Go-Go'' and ''Shindig'' and had made initial recordings, but the start of their real success lay in the future and overseas.<ref name="mojojan2013"/>

While working as a session drummer, Leeds had recently toured the United Kingdom with [[P.J. Proby]], and persuaded both John and Scott to try their luck with him on the British pop scene. The Walker Brothers arrived in London in early 1965. Their first single, "[[Pretty Girls Everywhere]]" (with John still installed as lead singer) crept into the charts but did not place highly. Their next single, "[[Love Her (song)|Love Her]]" – with Scott's deeper baritone in the lead – was a more substantial chart hit and he became the group's frontman.<ref name="Guardianobit">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/25/scott-walker-obituary |title=Scott Walker obituary |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=March 25, 2019}}</ref>

The Walker Brothers' next release, "[[Make It Easy on Yourself]]", a [[Burt Bacharach|Bacharach]]/[[Hal David|David]] ballad, went to No. 1 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] (number 16 on the U.S. charts) on release in August 1965. After hitting again with "[[My Ship Is Comin' In|My Ship Is Coming In]]" (number 3 UK), their second No. 1 (number 13 U.S.), "[[The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Any More]]", shot to the top in early 1966; shortly thereafter their fan club grew to contain more members than the official fan club of [[the Beatles]].<ref>{{cite video |people=Kijak, Stephen (Director) |year=2006 |title=Scott Walker:30 Century Man}}</ref> Although this is no indication that their actual fan base was larger than that of the Beatles, the Walker Brothers, especially lead singer Scott, attained pop star status.

Finding suitable material was always a problem. The Walkers' 1960s sound mixes [[Phil Spector]]'s "[[wall of sound]]" techniques with symphonic orchestrations featuring Britain's top musicians and arrangers, notably [[Ivor Raymonde]]. Scott served as effective co-producer of the band's records throughout this period (alongside their named producer, [[Johnny Franz]] and engineer [[Peter Oliff]]), later described as a "parallel, if invisible Walker Brothers."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anthonyreynolds.net/writing_walker_brothers/walker_brothers01.htm|title=The Walker Brothers Story|publisher=Anthony Reynolds|access-date=March 25, 2019}}</ref>  Many of their earlier numbers had a driving beat, but with the release of their third album, ''[[Images (The Walker Brothers album)|Images]],'' in 1967 ballads predominated.

By 1967, John Walker's musical influence on the Walker Brothers had waned (although he sang lead on a cover of "[[Blueberry Hill (song)|Blueberry Hill]]" and contributed two original compositions), which led to tensions between him and Scott. At the same time, Scott was finding the group a chafing experience: "There was a lot of pressure. I was coming up with all the material for the boys, and I was having to find songs and getting the sessions together. Everyone relied on me, and it just got on top of me. I think I just got irritated with it all."<ref name="guardianbrother"/> Artistic differences and the stresses stemming from overwhelming pop stardom led to the break-up of the Walker Brothers the same year, although they reunited briefly for a tour of Japan in 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.roughtrade.com/gb/music/everything-under-the-sun-osaka-japan-1968|title=Scott Walker and the Walker Brothers - Everything Under the Sun|publisher=Rough Trade|access-date=March 25, 2019}}</ref>

===1967–1974: Solo work===
For his solo career, Walker shed the Walker Brothers' mantle and worked in a style clearly glimpsed on ''[[Images (The Walker Brothers album)|Images]]''. Initially, this led to a continuation of his previous band's success. Walker's first four albums, titled ''[[Scott (album)|Scott]]'' (1967), ''[[Scott 2]]'' (1968), ''[[Scott 3]]'' (1969), and ''[[Scott: Scott Walker Sings Songs from his TV Series]]'' (1969), all sold in large numbers, with ''Scott 2'' topping the British charts.

 |description  = One of Walker's most popular recordings, the [[Jacques Brel]] cover "[[Jacky (Jacques Brel song)|Jackie]]" from ''[[Scott 2]]'' showcases Walker's style on his early solo albums.}}During this period, Walker combined his earlier teen appeal with a darker, more idiosyncratic approach (which had been hinted at in songs like "Orpheus" on the ''[[Images (The Walker Brothers album)|Images]]'' album). While his vocal style remained consistent with the Walker Brothers, he now drove a fine line between classic ballads, [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] hits and his own compositions, and also included risqué recordings of [[Jacques Brel]] songs (translated by [[Mort Shuman]], who was also responsible for the hit musical ''[[Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris]]''). Walker's own original songs of this period were influenced by Brel and [[Léo Ferré]]<ref>Young, Rob (2013). ''Scott: The Collection 1967–1970'', Universal.</ref> as he explored European musical roots while expressing his own American experience and reaching a new maturity as a recording artist.

Walker continued to grow as a producer. In 1968 (during the brief Walker Brothers reunion and tour of Japan), he produced a single with the Japanese rock group the Carnabeats, featuring Gary Walker on vocals.<ref name="The Impossible Dream">{{cite book |last=Reynolds |first=Anthony |title=The Impossible Dream: the Story of Scott Walker and the Walker Brothers |year=2009 |publisher=Jawbone Press |location=London |isbn=978-1-906002-25-1 |edition=1st}}</ref> Upon his return to the UK, he produced a solo album for the Walker Brothers' musical director and guitarist [[Terry Smith (British jazz guitarist)|Terry Smith]]. In 1968, Walker also produced ''[[Ray Warleigh]]'s First Album''. According to Anthony Reynolds, "[Warleigh's] album, recorded on December 13 and released in the following year, had little in common with the more esoteric progressive jazz that Scott was digging at the time, and the result veered more toward pleasantly middle-of-the-road muzak than the jazz fusion just around the corner."<ref name="The Impossible Dream"/> In 1968, Scott Walker also produced [[John Walker (musician)|John Maus]]'s solo single "Woman".<ref name="The Impossible Dream"/>

Walker's own relationship with fame, and the concentrated attention which it brought to him, remained a problem for his emotional well-being. He became reclusive and increasingly distanced from his audience. In 1968 he threw himself into an intense study of contemporary and classical music, which included a sojourn in [[Quarr Abbey]], a Catholic [[Benedictine]] monastery in [[Ryde]] on the [[Isle of Wight]], to study [[Gregorian chant]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iowrock.demon.co.uk/nothing/intro.html |first=Mike |last=Plumbley |title=From Tennyson to Hendrix |website=Isle of Wight Rocks |access-date=September 14, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926220343/http://www.iowrock.demon.co.uk/nothing/intro.html |archive-date=September 26, 2011}}</ref> building on an interest in [[lieder]] and classical musical modes.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/culture/2012/12/arbitrary-cult-status-scott-walker|title=The arbitrary cult status of Scott Walker|magazine=New Statesman|access-date=March 25, 2019}}</ref>

At the peak of his fame in 1969, Walker was given his own BBC TV series, ''Scott'', featuring solo Walker performances of ballads, big band standards, Brel songs and his own compositions. Archival footage of the show is extremely rare as recordings were not conserved. (However, audio selections from the show were released in 2019 as the box set ''Live on Air 1968-1969''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/release/14375660-Scott-Walker-Live-On-Air-1968-1969|website=Discogs|title=Scott Walker – Live On Air 1968-1969|accessdate=November 5, 2021}}</ref> In later interviews Walker has suggested that by the time of his third solo LP, a self-indulgent complacency had crept into his choice of material. His fourth solo album, ''[[Scott: Scott Walker Sings Songs from his TV Series]],'' exemplified the problems he was having in failing to balance his own creative work with the demands of the entertainment industry and of his manager Maurice King, who seemed determined to mould his protégé into a new [[Andy Williams]] or [[Frank Sinatra]].<ref name="mojojan2013" /> Despite the failure of the ''Scott'' TV show, the aforementioned companion LP ''Scott: Scott Walker Sings Songs from his TV Series'' was a commercial success, reaching the top 10 of the [[UK Albums Chart]] - Walker's last album to do so.

Having parted company with King, Walker released his fifth solo LP – ''[[Scott 4]]'' – in 1969. Compensating for his recent dip into passivity, this was his first record to be made up entirely of self-penned material. The album with songs from the TV series was [[Deletion (music industry)|deleted]] soon after. It has been speculated that Walker's decision to release ''[[Scott 4]]'' under his birth name of Scott Engel contributed to its chart failure. All subsequent re-issues of the album have been released under his stage name.

Walker then entered a period of self-confessed artistic decline, during which he spent five years making records "by rote, just to get out of contract"<ref name="mojojan2013" /> and consoling himself with drink.<ref name="mojojan2013" /><ref name="guardianbrother" /> His next album, ''[['Til the Band Comes In]]'' (1970), showed a pronounced split between its two sides. Side A featured original material (mostly co-written with new manager Ady Semel) while side B consisted almost entirely of cover versions. Subsequent releases saw Walker revert to cover versions of popular film tunes and a serious flirtation with [[country music]]. ''[[The Moviegoer (album)|The Moviegoer]]'' (1972), ''[[Any Day Now (Scott Walker album)|Any Day Now]]'' (1973), ''[[Stretch (album)|Stretch]]'' (1973), and ''[[We Had It All]]'' (1974) feature no original material whatsoever.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aquariumdrunkard.com/2015/01/14/scott-walker-we-had-it-all/|title=Scott Walker:We Had It all|publisher=Aquarium Drunkard|access-date=March 25, 2019}}</ref>

In the 2006 documentary ''[[Scott Walker: 30 Century Man]]'', Walker describes these as his "lost years" in terms of creativity. He has also confessed to having surrendered his direction due to outside pressure: {{blockquote|The record company called me in [following the commercial failure of ''[[Scott 4]]''] and carpeted me and said you've got to make a commercial record for us... I was acting in bad faith for many years during that time... I was trying to hang on. I should have stopped. I should have said, 'OK, forget it' and walked away. But I thought if I keep hanging on and making these bloody awful records... this is going to turn round if I just hang in long enough, and it didn't. It went from bad to worse...<ref name="guardianbrother"/>}}

=== 1975–1978: The Walker Brothers reunite ===
By the mid-1970s, Walker's career was at its nadir, and he joined back up with John Maus and Gary Leeds to revive the Walker Brothers in 1975. Their first comeback single, a cover of [[Tom Rush]]'s song "[[No Regrets (Tom Rush song)|No Regrets]]", from the [[No Regrets (The Walker Brothers album)|album of the same title]] reached number 7 in the UK Singles Chart, some months after its release. However, the parent album peaked at only number 49 in the [[UK Albums Chart]]. The two singles from the next album ''[[Lines (The Walker Brothers album)|Lines]]'' (its [[Lines (song)|title track]], which Scott regarded as the best single the group ever released, and "[[We're All Alone]]") both failed to chart, and the album fared no better.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gb.napster.com/artist/the-walker-brothers/album/lines-27715672|title=Lines|publisher=Napster|access-date=March 26, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://top40-charts.com/news.php?nid=145377|title=Singer/Songwriter Scott Walker Dies At 76|publisher=Top40-charts.con|access-date=March 26, 2019}}</ref>

With the imminent demise of their record label, the Walkers collaborated on an album of original material that was in stark contrast to the country-flavoured tunes of the previous 1970s albums. The resulting album, ''[[Nite Flights (album)|Nite Flights]]'', was released in 1978 with each of the Brothers writing and singing their own compositions. The opening four songs were Scott's, the final four John's, while the middle pair were by Gary. Scott's four songs – "[[Nite Flights (song)|Nite Flights]]", "[[The Electrician (song)|The Electrician]]", "Shut Out", and "Fat Mama Kick" – were his first original compositions since ''[['Til the Band Comes In]]'' and represented his first steps away from the [[Middle of the road (music)|MOR]] image and sound he had cultivated since the commercial failure of ''[[Scott 4]]''. The extremely dark and discomforting sound of Scott's songs, particularly "[[The Electrician (song)|The Electrician]]", was to prove a forerunner to the direction of his future solo work.<ref name="Guardianobit"/>

In spite of a warm critical reception (with his contributions particularly lauded), sales figures for ''Nite Flights'' were ultimately as poor as those of ''Lines''. The supporting tour saw the band concentrating on the old hits and ballads and ignoring the songs from their new record. Apparently now fated for a stagnant career on the revival circuit, the Walker Brothers lost heart and interest, compounded by Scott's increasing reluctance to sing live. By the end of 1978, now without a record deal, the group drifted apart again and Scott Walker entered a three-year period of obscurity and no releases.<ref name="mojojan2013"/>

===1981–1995: A new solo voice (''Climate of Hunter'' and ''Tilt'')===
In 1981, interest in Scott Walker's work was stimulated by the compilation ''[[Fire Escape in the Sky: The Godlike Genius of Scott Walker]]'', containing tracks selected by [[Julian Cope]], which reached number 14 on the [[UK Independent Chart]].<ref name="Lazell">{{cite book |last=Lazell |first=Barry |year=1998 |title=Indie Hits 1980–1989 |publisher=Cherry Red Books |isbn=0-95172-069-4 |page=250}}</ref> Building on the critical and sales momentum of the compilation, Walker subsequently signed with Virgin Records.<ref name="Guardianobit"/>

In 1984, Scott Walker released his first solo album in ten years, ''[[Climate of Hunter]]''. The album furthered the complex and unnerving approach Walker had established on ''[[Nite Flights (album)|Nite Flights]]''. While based loosely within the field of 1980s rock music (and featuring guest appearances by contemporary stars [[Billy Ocean]] and [[Mark Knopfler]]), it had a fragmented and trance-like approach.<ref name="mojojan2013"/> Many of its eight songs lacked either titles or easily identifiable melody, with only Walker's sonorous voice as the link to previous work. Like ''[[Nite Flights (album)|Nite Flights]]'' before it, ''[[Climate of Hunter]]'' was met with critical praise but low sales. Plans to tour were made but never came to fruition. A second album for Virgin was rumoured to be in the works (with [[Brian Eno]] and [[Daniel Lanois]] producing) but was abandoned after early sessions. Soon afterwards, Walker was dropped by the label.<ref name="FACT">{{cite web|url=https://www.factmag.com/2014/10/17/the-essential-scott-walker-2014/|title=The essential...Scott Walker|publisher=FACT magazine|access-date=March 25, 2019}}</ref>

Walker spent the late 1980s away from music, with only a brief cameo appearance in a 1987 [[Britvic]] TV advert (alongside other 1960s pop icons) to maintain his profile.<ref name="mojojan2013"/> He did not return to public attention until the early 1990s when his solo and Walker Brothers work was critically reappraised again. During this period Walker's first four studio albums were issued on CD for the first time and the compilation album ''[[No Regrets – The Best of Scott Walker and The Walker Brothers 1965–1976]]'' hit number 4 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Walker's own return to current active work was gradual and cautious. In 1992 he co-wrote and co-performed (with [[Goran Bregović]]) the single "[[Man from Reno (song)|Man From Reno]]" for the soundtrack of the film ''Toxic Affair''. Having signed to [[Fontana Records]], he began work on a new album. In the meantime [[David Bowie]] covered Scott's song "Nite Flights" on his ''[[Black Tie White Noise]]'' album, which also contained the Walker inspired 'You've Been Around'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bowiesongs.wordpress.com/2012/09/20/youve-been-around/|title=You've Been Around|publisher=Pushing Ahead of the Dame|access-date=March 26, 2019}}</ref>

''[[Tilt (Scott Walker album)|Tilt]]''  was released in 1995, developing and expanding the working methods explored on ''[[Climate of Hunter]]''. Variously described as "an anti-matter collision of rock and modern classical music",<ref name="mojojan2013" /> as "[[Samuel Beckett]] at [[La Scala]]" and as "indescribably barren and unutterably bleak... the wind that buffets the gothic cathedrals of everyone's favorite nightmares",<ref name=amgtilt>{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Thompson |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/tilt-mw0000595998 |title=Tilt – Scott Walker |website=AllMusic |access-date=August 21, 2014}}</ref> it was more consciously avant-garde than its predecessor with Walker now revealed as a fully-fledged modernist composer.<ref name="guardianbrother" /> Although Walker was backed by a full orchestra again, this time he was also accompanied by alarming percussion and industrial effects; and while album opener "Farmer in the City" was a melodic piece on which Walker exercised his familiar ballad voice, the remaining pieces were harsh and demandingly avant-garde.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://music.avclub.com/navigating-the-diverse-difficult-musical-career-of-sco-1798235081|title= Navigating the diverse, difficult musical career of Scott Walker|last= Murray|first= Noel|date= December 6, 2012|website= [[The A.V.

Lyrically, subject matter included the life and murder of [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] (and his relationship with [[Ninetto Davoli]]), [[cockfighting]], the [[First Gulf War]], a conflation of the trials of [[Adolf Eichmann]] and [[Caroline of Brunswick]], and a man talking to the corpse of [[Che Guevara]].<ref name="mojojan2013"/>

===1996–2005: Interim work (guest appearances, songs for others, ''Pola X'')===
In 1996, Walker recorded the [[Bob Dylan]] song "[[I Threw It All Away]]" under the direction of [[Nick Cave]] for inclusion in the soundtrack for the film ''To Have and to Hold''. In 1998, in a rare return to straightforward balladeering, he recorded the [[David Arnold]] song "Only Myself to Blame" (for the soundtrack of the [[James Bond (film series)|Bond film]] ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'') and also wrote and produced the soundtrack for the [[Léos Carax]] film ''[[Pola X]]'', which was released as an album. In 1999, he wrote and produced two songs for [[Ute Lemper]] on her album ''[[Punishing Kiss]]'', credited as N.S. Engel. (One of these, ''Lullaby'', is only available as a bonus track on the Japanese version of the CD.) <ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arM2xvCt87UC&q=Punishing+Kiss+japanese&pg=PT168|title=No Regrets:Writings on Scott Walker|first=Rob|last=Young|date=May 17, 2012|isbn=9781409110910}}</ref>

In 2000, Walker curated the London [[South Bank Centre]]'s annual summer live music festival, [[Meltdown (festival)|Meltdown]], which has a tradition of celebrity curators. He did not perform at Meltdown himself, but wrote the music for the Richard Alston Dance Project item ''Thimblerigging''. The following year he served as producer on [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]]'s 2001 album ''[[We Love Life]]'' (whose track "Bad Cover Version" includes a mocking reference to the poor quality of "the second side of ''[['Til The Band Comes In]]''").

In October 2003, Walker was given an award for his contribution to music by [[Q (magazine)|''Q'' magazine]], presented by [[Jarvis Cocker]] of Pulp. Walker received a standing ovation at the presentation. This award had been presented only twice before, the first time to [[Phil Spector]], and the second to [[Brian Eno]]. The release of a retrospective box set, ''[[5 Easy Pieces]]'', comprising five themed discs spanning Walker's work with the Walker Brothers, his solo career (including film soundtrack work), and the two pieces composed for Ute Lemper, followed soon after.
The British independent label [[4AD Records]] signed Walker in early 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.factmag.com/2019/03/25/scott-walker-dies-age-76/|title=Scott Walker dies age 76|publisher=GACT Magazine|access-date=March 25, 2019}}</ref>

===2006–2019: ''The Drift'', ''Bish Bosch'', ''Soused'', and others===
On May 8, 2006, Scott Walker released ''[[The Drift]]'', his first new album in 11 years. Critical acclaim for the album garnered a [[Metacritic]] score of 85.<ref name=Metacritic>{{cite web |title=Album Releases by Score (2006) |url=http://www.metacritic.com/browse/albums/score/metascore/year?sort=desc&view=condensed&year_selected=2006 |website=Metacritic |access-date=January 29, 2012}}</ref>

In both composition and atmosphere, ''[[The Drift]]'' was a continuation of the surreal, menacing, partially abstract approach displayed on ''[[Climate of Hunter]]'' and ''[[Tilt (Scott Walker album)|Tilt]]''. It featured jarring contrasts between loud and quiet sections; instrumentation was similar to ''[[Tilt (Scott Walker album)|Tilt]]'' in the use of rock instruments and a large orchestra, but the album also interpolated unnerving sound effects such as the distressed braying of a donkey, a demoniac Donald Duck impression, and (during a recording sequence captured on film) an orchestral percussionist punching a large cut of raw meat. Lyrical subjects included torture, disease, the relationship and eventual shared death of [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] and his mistress [[Clara Petacci]], and a conflation of the [[9/11]] attacks with a nightmare shared by [[Elvis Presley]] and his dead twin brother Jesse.{{r|'nymag'}}{{r|'wiremay2006'}} In contemporary interviews, Walker appeared more at ease with media attention, revealing a wish to produce albums more frequently and hinting at significant changes in the nature of his own material if and when it suits him. Although he mentioned the possibility of touring again with a compact, five-piece band in an interview with ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'' this never transpired.{{r|'wiremay2006'}}

In June 2006, ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' and radio honored Scott Walker with the [[MOJO Awards|MOJO Icon Award]]: "Voted for by ''Mojo'' readers and Mojo4music users, the recipient of this award has enjoyed a spectacular career on a global scale". It was presented by Phil Alexander.
A documentary film, ''[[Scott Walker: 30 Century Man]]'', was completed in 2006 by New York film director [[Stephen Kijak]] (''Cinemania'' and ''Never Met Picasso''). Interviews were recorded with [[David Bowie]] (executive producer of the film), [[Radiohead]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Gavin Friday]] and many musicians associated with Walker over the years. The World Premiere of ''Scott Walker: 30 Century Man'' took place as part of the 50th [[London Film Festival]]. When ''[[The Independent]]'' released its list of "Ten must-see films" at the 50th London Film Festival, ''Scott Walker: 30 Century Man'', was among them. A documentary on Walker containing a substantial amount of footage from the film was shown on BBC1 in May 2007 as part of the ''[[Imagine (TV series)|Imagine...]]'' strand, presented by [[Alan Yentob]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007lw6k|title=BBC One -imagine|publisher=BBC|access-date=March 25, 2019}}</ref>

Walker released "Darkness" as part of ''[[Plague Songs]]'', an album of songs for the ''Margate Exodus'' project, a re-telling of the [[Book of Exodus]], the story of [[Moses]] and his search for the [[Promised Land]]. Ten singer-songwriters were commissioned by Artangel to write and record a song inspired by one of the [[Plagues of Egypt|ten biblical plagues]]. Walker's evocation of "Darkness" appears as the ninth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Plague-Songs-Various-Artists/dp/B000S5C0QY|title=Plague Songs by Various Artists|publisher=Amazon|access-date=March 26, 2019}}</ref>

On September 24, 2007, Walker released ''[[And Who Shall Go to the Ball? And What Shall Go to the Ball?]]'' as a limited, never-to-be-re-pressed edition. The 24-minute instrumental work was performed by the [[London Sinfonietta]] with solo cellist [[Philip Sheppard (musician)|Philip Sheppard]] as music to a performance by London-based [[CandoCo]] Dance Company. The recording is currently unavailable. From November 13 to 15, 2008, ''Drifting and Tilting: The Songs of Scott Walker'' was staged at [[Barbican Centre|The Barbican]], in London. It comprised eight songs, two from ''[[Tilt (Scott Walker album)|Tilt]]'' – "Farmer in the City" and "Patriot (a single)" – and the rest from ''[[The Drift]]'': "Cossacks Are", "Jesse", "Clara (Benito's Dream)", "Buzzers", "Jolson and Jones" and "Cue". Each song was presented in a music-theatre manner, with the vocal parts taken by a number of singers, including [[Jarvis Cocker]], [[Damon Albarn]] and [[Dot Allison]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/17/scott-walker-review-barbican-pop|title=Review:Drifting and Tilting: The Songs of Scott Walker|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=March 25, 2019}}</ref>

Walker collaborated with [[Bat for Lashes]] on the song "The Big Sleep" from her 2009 album ''[[Two Suns]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/48624/Bat-For-Lashes-Duets-With-Scott-Walker-On-Second-Album |first=Scott |last=Colothan |title=Bat For Lashes Duets With Scott Walker on Second Album |work=Gigwise.com |date=January 9, 2009 |access-date=September 14, 2011}}</ref> He wrote the score for the ROH2 production of [[Jean Cocteau]]'s 1932 play ''Duet for One'', which was staged in the [[Linbury Studio]] in June 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://officiallondontheatre.com/news/alice-falls-down-the-rabbit-hole-at-the-royal-opera-house-109951/ |title=Alice falls down the rabbit hole at the Royal Opera House |date=March 11, 2010 |website=OfficialLondonTheatre.com|access-date=October 31, 2017}}</ref>

Walker's final solo album, ''[[Bish Bosch]]'', was released on December 3, 2012 and was received with generally favourable reviews.<ref name="bishboschmetacritic">{{cite web |title=Bish Bosch Reviews |url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/bish-bosch/scott-walker |website=Metacritic |access-date=May 30, 2014}}</ref>

In 2014, Walker collaborated with the experimental drone metal duo [[Sunn O)))]] on ''[[Soused (album)|Soused]]'', which was released on October 21, 2014.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8504059/scott-walker-career-ten-songs|title=Scott Walker's Iconoclastic Career in Music, Told Through 10 of His Best Songs|magazine=Billboard|access-date=March 26, 2019}}</ref>

In 2015, Walker composed the score for [[Brady Corbet]]'s film ''[[The Childhood of a Leader (film)|The Childhood of a Leader]]'';<ref>{{cite web|first=Kevin |last=Jagernauth |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/nymphomaniac-star-stacy-martin-joins-childhood-of-a-leader-with-robert-pattinson-scott-walker-to-score-film-20141013 |title=Nymphomaniac' Star Stacy Martin Joins Childhood of a Leader' With Robert Pattinson, Scott Walker To Score |website=IndieWire |date=October 13, 2014 |access-date=January 5, 2017}}</ref> this was followed in 2018 by the score for Corbet's film ''[[Vox Lux]]'', also featuring music by Australian singer-songwriter [[Sia (musician)|Sia]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Cameron|last=Bailey|url=https://www.tiff.net/tiff/vox-lux/ |title=Vox Lux |website=Toronto International Film Festival |date=August 21, 2018|access-date=August 22, 2018}}</ref>

==Artistry and compositional approach==
Initially working as an interpreter of other people's songs, Scott Walker had developed his own songwriting skills by the heyday of the Walker Brothers and by the time of his first solo album in 1967. In a 1984 interview he spoke of difficulty in writing songs: "I don't write songs for pleasure. I can only write when I have to – like I'm under contract, or to finish an album."<ref name="Terrill">{{Cite magazine |last=Terrill |first=Terry |year=1984 |title=Scott Walker Take Two |magazine=Debut |issue=2 |page=18}}</ref>

Walker's late 1960s and 1970s work was relatively conventional. On a superficial level, it followed the melodic orchestral pop template used by singers such as [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Andy Williams]] and [[Jack Jones (singer)|Jack Jones]] – mainstream artists whose career path he was initially expected to follow. Crucial differences came via the more avant-garde orchestrations of his arrangers (primarily [[Angela Morley]] (at the time known as Wally Stott), [[Peter Knight (composer)|Peter Knight]] and [[Reg Guest]]) and by Walker's own approach to lyrics, which involved a cinematic mise-en-scene approach once described as "unsettling short stories, all the more creepy for their delicate orchestral backdrop."<ref name="guardianbrother"/> As his solo career progressed, Walker began working political themes into his lyrics. Among the first of these was "The Old Man's Back Again (Dedicated to the Neo-Stalinist Regime)" (from ''[[Scott 4]]''). Further references came via his dramatisation of the work of a CIA torturer on "The Electrician" (''[[Nite Flights (album)|Nite Flights]]'').<ref name="FACT"/>

Walker's next artistic development as a songwriter came when he jettisoned his remaining conventional lyrical concerns along with his remaining connections to formal popular song (and, by extension, the easy-listening ballads which he had been famous for). The ''[[New York Times]]'' described Walker as arriving at "the point where he barely needs melody anymore. Instead, there are whirring synthesizers, great orchestral blocks of sound, noises of unknown provenance."<ref name="nymag"/> Despite the radical alteration of his methods, Walker commented that he did not consider himself a "composer" in the established sense of the term: "I think of myself as a songwriter, but I agree they are maybe not traditional songs. I know what people mean, but what else can you call them?"<ref name="guardianbrother"/>

Walker described his lyrical technique (assembling short blocks of text containing images that are sometimes seemingly unconnected and disparate from each other) as being similar to "a general, assembling troops on the battlefield." ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'' has noted that the short blocks of white-on-black text presented in the CD insert for ''[[The Drift]]'' is reflective of this. The roots of this compositional technique are apparent as early as the Scott Walker tracks on ''Nite Flights'' – the lyrics insert for the album clearly feature the technique, albeit with a black text on a white background.{{r|'wiremay2006'}}

Walker stated in the documentary film ''[[Scott Walker: 30 Century Man]]'' and in numerous interviews that for his entire career he has not listened to any of his own work after completion, either due to exhaustion from the project or self-criticism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/01/09/168915914/scott-walker-on-world-cafe |title=Scott Walker: 'I Don't Listen Again And I Move On' : World Cafe |website=Npr.org |date=2013-01-09 |access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Mark Brown |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jul/21/scott-walker-refuses-to-listen-to-old-songs-despite-proms-accolade |title=Scott Walker refuses to listen to old songs despite Proms accolade &#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref>
