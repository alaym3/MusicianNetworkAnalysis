==History==

===Formation and ''Ground Dweller'' (2008–2013)===
Formed in 2008 from the remnants of other local bands, So Long Safety and Eternal Debut, the band traveled to Chango Studios to record material to record ''[[Ground Dweller]]'' (which began as an EP, as stated by Woodley) with producer [[Cameron Mizell]]. However, the EP never was released and the band decided to re-record some of the tracks and record six new tracks for a full-length album.  In 2011, the band released singles for "This Ain't No Place for Animals" and "Lion Skin" (which features a few differences from the one included in their full-length) on iTunes, garnering over 5,000 single sales. They also released a demo version of "One Hundred" in their PureVolume profile.

In January 2012 the band signed with [[Rise Records]]<ref name="Alternative Press Magazine">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/hands_like_houses_sign_to_rise_records_stream_new_song|title=Alt Press Signing Announcement and New Song Stream|magazine=[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]|access-date=2012-04-14}}</ref> and released ''Ground Dweller'', in March,<ref name="Hevy Petal">{{cite web|url=http://www.hevypetal.com/news/180/hands-like-houses-announce-album-launch-date|title=Hands Like Houses Announce Album Launch Date|website=Hevypetal.com|access-date=2012-04-14|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627124535/http://hevypetal.com/news/180/hands-like-houses-announce-album-launch-date|archive-date=27 June 2012}}</ref> streaming the entire album on the ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' website.<ref name="full stream">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/hands_like_houses_stream_new_album_ground_dweller|title=Hands Like Houses Stream New Album, "Ground Dweller"|magazine=[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]|access-date=2012-04-14}}</ref> ''Ground Dweller'' debuted at No.&nbsp;141 on the [[Billboard 200|Billboard Top 200]] and number 2 on the [[Top Heatseekers|Billboard Heatseekers Chart]].<ref name="Billboard.com"/> and has been generally well received.
