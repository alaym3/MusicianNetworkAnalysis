==''Idol'' Career==
===2009–2011: ''American Idol'' Overview ===
[[File:Reinhart with Casey Abrams and Paul McDonald.jpg|thumb|left|Reinhart performing with Casey Abrams and Paul McDonald on the Idols Live Tour, July 2011]]
Reinhart first auditioned for the [[American Idol (season 9)|ninth season]] of ''American Idol'', in Chicago, but did not advance to the Hollywood round. However, she returned the following year for the [[American Idol (season 10)|tenth season]] of ''Idol'' in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], and advanced after singing [[The Beatles]]' "[[Oh! Darling]]". Although she auditioned with two songs, the first being [[Alicia Keys]]'s "[[Fallin' (Alicia Keys song)|Fallin']]", only her second song choice of "Oh! Darling" was aired on television.<ref name="Fallin">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5XNsjzB0Dw |title=Haley Reinhart interview on The Morning Show in Canada  |publisher=YouTube |date=October 25, 2014 |access-date=January 1, 2016}}</ref>

She successfully progressed through the first Hollywood solo round after singing "[[Breathless (Corinne Bailey Rae song)|Breathless]]" by [[Corinne Bailey Rae]]. In the group round of Hollywood week, her group mates included fellow finalist [[Paul McDonald (musician)|Paul McDonald]], and she advanced even after forgetting some of the lyrics to "[[Carry On Wayward Son]]." Later in the second solo round, she performed "[[God Bless the Child (Billie Holiday song)|God Bless the Child]]", impressing the judges and making a comeback from her weaker group performance. In the Vegas Round, she grouped up with fellow finalists [[Naima Adedapo]] and [[Jacob Lusk]] to perform [[The Beatles]]'s "[[The Long and Winding Road]]", which earned all three contestants a spot among the final 48 competitors. Reinhart was selected by the judges as a semi-finalist after her final Hollywood solo performance, and she was later voted into the Top 12 finalists after singing "Fallin'" by Alicia Keys during the live semi-final show. Though she was among the bottom three singers on four occasions during the finals, she advanced through to the penultimate week of the competition after giving memorable performances of "[[House of the Rising Sun]]" and "[[I (Who Have Nothing)]]" during Top 5-week and Top 4-week, respectively. She was eliminated in third place behind [[Scotty McCreery]] and [[Lauren Alaina]], who progressed to the finale. She sang "[[Bennie and the Jets]]" for her farewell encore performance. Though the judges often harshly criticized her for song choices and stage presence, she was considered a fan-favorite and a [[dark horse]] in the competition.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-haley-reinhart-postmodern-jukebox-cover-creep-20150408-story.html |title=Haley Reinhart's 'Creep' cover with Postmodern Jukebox is worth a listen |author=Gerrick D.
