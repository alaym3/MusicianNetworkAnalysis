==History==
===Formation and ''All Wound Up'' (1995–1997)===
In February 1995, [[Sully Erna]] decided to start a new band as the lead singer after playing the drums for more than 23 years, including more than two years in the now-defunct band Strip Mind.<ref name="Godsmack biography">{{cite web |url= http://www.godsmack.com/bio/bio.asp |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930171134/http://www.godsmack.com/bio/bio.asp |archive-date= September 30, 2007 |title=Godsmack – Bio |access-date=October 10, 2007 |publisher=Godsmack.com}}</ref> His new band, The Scam, formed with Erna on vocals, [[Robbie Merrill]] on bass, local guitarist and friend Lee Richards on guitar, and [[Tommy Stewart]] on drums. The Scam quickly changed its name to Godsmack, after recording one demo.<ref name="Rolling Stone with Sully">{{cite magazine |author=Scaggs, Austin |date=May 6, 2003 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/godsmack/articles/story/5936304/sully_awakes |title=Sully Awakes |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=December 2, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210033805/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/godsmack/articles/story/5936304/sully_awakes |archive-date=December 10, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The newly formed band started playing small bars in their hometown of [[Boston]]. Locally popular songs such as "[[Keep Away (song)|Keep Away]]" and "[[Whatever (Godsmack song)|Whatever]]" soon brought them to the top of the hit charts in the Boston/New England area.<ref name="Godsmack biography"/>

Many people think the band's name stemmed from an [[Alice in Chains]] song, but according to Erna, the band's name came from a small and personal incident. "I was making fun of somebody who had a cold sore on his lip and the next day I had one myself and somebody said, 'It's a godsmack.' The name stuck. We were aware of the Alice In Chains song but didn't really think much about it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/1999/godsmack_int.asp |title=Sully Erna of Godsmack on Karma, Christians and the Law of Three (NY Rock) |access-date=October 10, 2007 |author=Gabriella |date=October 1, 1999 |publisher=Nyrock.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011092214/http://nyrock.com/interviews/1999/godsmack_int.asp |archive-date=October 11, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref> In 1996, [[Tony Rombola]] and Joe D'Arco joined Godsmack as the guitarist and drummer, after Richards left upon learning he had a six-year-old child and Stewart left due to personal differences.<ref name="Richards leaving stuff">{{cite web |author=Seaver, Morley |url=http://www.rocknworld.com/morley/06/Godsmack.shtml |title=MorleyView Interview with Shannon Larkin of Godsmack |publisher=MorleyView |access-date=December 6, 2007}}</ref> In the same year, the band entered the studio for the first time, recording its first CD titled ''[[All Wound Up (album)|All Wound Up]]''. The CD was recorded in just three days for $2,600.<ref name="Godsmack biography"/>

For the next two years, the band played throughout the Boston area. Eventually Godsmack's CD landed in the hands of Rocko, the night-time DJ for Boston radio station [[WKVB (FM)|WAAF (FM)]]. The radio station put "Keep Away" into heavy rotation and the song rose to the number one spot at the station very quickly.<ref name="Godsmack biography"/> Newbury Comics, a New England record store chain, agreed to sell the CD on consignment. Shortly after the success of "Keep Away", Godsmack went back into the studio and recorded a single titled "Whatever", which became the new local favorite on WAAF (FM).<ref name="Godsmack biography"/> In an interview Sully Erna stated, "We had been selling maybe 50 copies a month at the time WAAF picked up the album. All of a sudden we started moving over a thousand records a week. (...) I was doing all this from my bedroom. After years of grinding away, things finally started taking off."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.barrystickets.com/concert-tickets/godsmack-tickets.php |title=Godsmack biography – Barrystickets |access-date=January 2, 2008 |publisher=barrystickets.com}}</ref>

[[File:Godsmack logo.png|thumb|right|220px|Band font]]

In mid-1998, [[Universal Music Group|Universal]]/[[Republic Records]] signed the band to their label. Joe D'Arco was dismissed from the band. He was replaced by former drummer [[Tommy Stewart]], who returned after expressing a desire to be in the band again.<ref name="Drummer switch">{{cite news|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?Mode=Archive&Date=8/13/2002 |title=Godsmack's Sully Erna Speaks out on drummer switch |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=August 13, 2002 |access-date=December 6, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221093400/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?Mode=Archive&Date=8%2F13%2F2002 |archive-date=December 21, 2007 }}</ref> The band's first studio recording ''All Wound Up'' was re-mastered, and the finished self-titled debut CD album ''[[Godsmack (album)|Godsmack]]'' was released to the public six weeks later. This led to the band's first headlining tour, "The Godsmack Tour" with [[Jim Rose Circus]] as the opening act.<ref name="Godsmack biography"/>
After the album's release the band went on the road playing club shows as well as playing at [[Ozzfest]] and [[Woodstock '99]]. This was followed by a tour in [[Europe]] supporting [[Black Sabbath]].<ref name="Godsmack biography"/> Roxanne Blanford from Allmusic gave the album three out of five stars, stating, "Godsmack confidently brought metal into the technological age".<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r373845|pure_url=yes}}|title=Godsmack – self-titled review |access-date=November 9, 2007 |last=Blanford |first=Roxanne |website=Allmusic }}</ref> The album entered the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at number twenty-two,<ref name="Billboard">{{cite magazine|title=Godsmack – Artist chart history|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=godsmack|chart=all}}|access-date=November 6, 2007|magazine=Billboard.com}}</ref> and was certified [[Recording Industry Association of America certification|4x platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in 2001<ref name="Godsmack – 10 Years of Godsmack arrives December 4">{{cite web|title=Godsmack – News |url=http://www.godsmack.com/news/news.asp?item=111184 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111060224/http://www.godsmack.com/news/news.asp?item=111184 |archive-date=November 11, 2007 |access-date=November 6, 2007 |publisher=Godsmack.com}}</ref> after being initially certified gold in 1999.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|title=Godsmack – Biography|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p308309|pure_url=yes}}|work=Allmusic|year=2006|access-date=May 7, 2008}}</ref>

The album sold well despite being initially pulled from the shelves in some stores due to concerns over some of its [[Lyrics|lyrical]] content.<ref name="Godsmack lyrics cause controversy">{{cite web |title=Godsmack Lyrics and Biography |url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608002718/Godsmack.html |last=Schwalboski |first=Ann M |publisher=Musician guide |access-date=November 10, 2007}}</ref> The band and its [[record label]] later added a [[Parental Advisory]] sticker to the album, and some stores ordered amended copies of the album. Erna commented in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine stating, "Our record has been in the marketplace for more than a year now without a parental advisory sticker and this is the one and only complaint&nbsp;... Stickers and lyrics are by nature subjective&nbsp;... We have decided to put a sticker on the record."<ref name="Godsmack lyrics cause controversy"/> This controversy did not appear to adversely affect album sales but, according to Erna, helped; "It's almost taunting kids to go out and get the record to see what we're saying on it." The album also had four successful singles which were "Whatever", "Keep Away", "Voodoo" and "Bad Religion".

Two of the songs on the album were used in United States Navy commercials ("[[Sick of Life]]" and "[[Awake (Godsmack song)|Awake]]") as background music. Erna stated, "Someone in the military is a fan, and they asked if they could use the music, and we accepted".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=51830 |title=Godsmack Frontman Gets Defensive Over Band's Alleged 'Pro-Military' Stance |access-date=November 10, 2007 |first=Jay |last=Babcock |date=May 4, 2006 |publisher=Arthur Magazine |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219212633/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=51830 |archive-date=December 19, 2007 }}</ref> However, Erna insisted in an interview that Godsmack does not support any war.<ref name="ArthurMag">{{cite web |url=http://www.arthurmag.com/magpie/?p=1244 |title=Talking to Godsmack (Whose Album is No.&nbsp;1 on the charts) about what they use their music for.|date=May 6, 2006 |publisher=ArthurMag.com}}</ref>
