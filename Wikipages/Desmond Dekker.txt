'''Desmond Dekker''' (16 July 1941 – 25 May 2006<ref name="Thompson">Thompson, Dave (2002) "Reggae & Caribbean Music", Backbeat Books, {{ISBN|0-87930-655-6}}, Note: some sources list year of birth as 1942 or 1943</ref>) was a Jamaican [[ska]], [[rocksteady]] and [[reggae]] singer-songwriter and musician. Together with his backing group [[The Aces (Jamaican group)|The Aces]] (consisting of Wilson James and Easton Barrington Howard), he had one of the earliest international reggae hits with "[[Israelites (song)|Israelites]]" (1968). Other hits include "[[007 (Shanty Town)]]" (1967), "[[It Mek]]" (1969) and "[[You Can Get It If You Really Want]]" (1970).

==Early life==
Desmond Adolphus Dacres was born in [[Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica|Saint Andrew Parish (Greater Kingston), Jamaica]], on 16 July 1941. Dekker spent his formative years in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]. From a young age he regularly attended the local church with his grandmother and aunt. This early religious upbringing, as well as Dekker's enjoyment of singing hymns, led to a lifelong religious commitment. Following his mother's death, he moved to the parish of [[Saint Mary Parish, Jamaica|St. Mary]] and later to [[Saint Thomas Parish, Jamaica|St. Thomas]]. While at St. Thomas, Dekker embarked on an apprenticeship as a tailor before returning to Kingston, where he became a [[welder]]. His workplace singing had drawn the attention of his co-workers, who encouraged him to pursue a career in music.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p2878/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography by Jo-Ann Greene |publisher=Allmusic.com |access-date=18 October 2009}}</ref> In 1961 he auditioned for [[Coxsone Dodd]] ([[Studio One (record label)|Studio One]]) and [[Duke Reid]] (Treasure Isle), though neither audition was successful. The unsigned vocalist then auditioned for [[Leslie Kong]]'s [[Beverley's]] record label and was awarded his first recording contract.<ref name="AMG"/>

==Career==
Despite achieving a record deal, it was two years before Dekker saw his first record released. Meanwhile, Dekker spotted the talent of [[Bob Marley]], a fellow welder, and brought the youth to Kong's attention. In 1962 "Judge Not" and "One Cup Of Coffee" became the first recorded efforts of Marley, who retained gratitude, respect and admiration for Dekker for the rest of his life. Eventually in 1963 Kong chose "Honour Your Mother and Father" (written by Dekker and the song that Dekker had sung in his Kong audition two years earlier), which became a Jamaican hit and established Dekker's musical career. This was followed by the release of the tracks "Sinners Come Home" and "Labour for Learning". It was during this period that Desmond Dacres adopted the stage-name of Desmond Dekker. His fourth hit, "King of Ska" (backing vocals by The Cherrypies, also known as [[Toots & the Maytals|The Maytals]]), made him into one of the island's biggest stars. Dekker then recruited four brothers, Carl, Patrick, Clive and Barry Howard, as his permanent backing vocalists to perform with him under the name Desmond Dekker and The Aces.<ref name="AMG"/>

The new group recorded a number of Jamaican hits, including "Parents", "Get Up Edina", "This Woman" and "Mount Zion". The themes of Dekker's songs during the first four years of his career dealt with the moral, cultural and social issues of mainstream Jamaican culture: respect for one's parents ("Honour Your Mother and Father"), religious morality ("Sinners Come Home") and education ("Labour for Learning"). In 1967 he appeared on [[Derrick Morgan]]'s "Tougher Than Tough", which helped begin a trend of popular songs commenting on the [[rude boy]] subculture which was rooted in Jamaican ghetto life where opportunities for advancement were limited and life was economically difficult. Dekker's own songs did not go to the extremes of many other popular rude boy songs, which reflected the violence and social problems associated with ghetto life, though he did introduce lyrics that resonated with the rude boys, starting with one of his best-known songs, "[[007 (Shanty Town)]]". The song established Dekker as a rude boy icon in Jamaica and also became a favourite dance track for the young working-class men and women of the United Kingdom's [[mod (subculture)|mod]] scene.<ref name=Telegraphobit>{{cite news|title=Desmond Dekker|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1519534/Desmond-Dekker.html|access-date=25 January 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=27 May 2006}}</ref> "007 (Shanty Town)" was a Top 15 hit in the UK and his UK concerts were attended by a large following of mods wherever he played.<ref name="AMG"/>

Dekker continued to release rude boy songs such as "Rude Boy Train" and "Rudie Got Soul", as well as mainstream cultural songs like "It's a Shame", "Wise Man", "Hey Grandma", "Unity", "If It Pays", "Mother's Young Girl", "Sabotage" and "Pretty Africa".<ref>On the 22 August 1970 edition of American Top 40, Casey Kasem claimed that Dekker had more than 40 #1 records in Jamaica.</ref>  Many of the hits from this era came from his debut album, ''007 (Shanty Town)''.<ref name="AMG"/>

In 1968 Dekker's "[[Israelites (song)|Israelites]]" was released, eventually topping the [[UK Singles Chart]] in April 1969 and peaking in the [[Top 40|Top Ten]] of the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in June 1969.  Dekker was the first Jamaican artist to have a hit record in the US with a form and style that was purely Jamaican.  That same year saw the release of "Beautiful and Dangerous", "Writing on the Wall", "Music Like Dirt (Intensified '68)" (which won the 1968 [[Jamaica Independence Festival#Popular Song Competition|Jamaica Independence Festival Song Contest]]), "Bongo Girl" and "Shing a Ling".<ref name="AMG"/> 1969 saw the release of "[[It Mek]]", which became a hit both in Jamaica and the UK.<ref>[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/desmond%20dekker%20%26%20the%20aces "UK Official Chart Hits for Desmond Dekker"] Retrieved 26 January 2013.</ref> Dekker also released "Problems" and "Pickney Gal", both of which were popular in Jamaica, although only "Pickney Gal" managed to chart in the UK Top 50.<ref name="AMG"/>

In 1969 Dekker took permanent residency in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|title=Desmond Dekker|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/obituaries/2006/06/desmond-dekker/|publisher=www.thestage.co.uk|date=26 June 2006|access-date=28 January 2013}}</ref>

===1970s===
In 1970 Dekker released "You Can Get It If You Really Want", written by [[Jimmy Cliff]], which reached No. 2 in the UK charts.  Dekker was initially reluctant to record the track but was eventually persuaded to do so by [[Leslie Kong]].<ref name="AMG"/>  Dekker's version uses the same backing track as Cliff's original.  Kong, whose music production skills had been a crucial part of both Dekker's and Cliff's careers, died in 1971, affecting the careers of both artists for a short period of time.<ref name="AMG"/>  In 1972 the rude boy film ''[[The Harder They Come]]'' was released and Dekker's "007 (Shanty Town)" was featured on [[The Harder They Come (soundtrack)|the soundtrack]] along with Cliff's version of "You Can Get It...", as well as other Jamaican artists' hits, giving reggae more international exposure and preparing the way for [[Bob Marley]].

In 1975 "Israelites" was re-released and became a UK Top 10 hit for a second time.  Dekker had also begun working on new material with the production duo Bruce Anthony in 1974.  In 1975 this collaboration resulted in the release of "[[Sing a Little Song]]", which charted in the UK Top Twenty; this was to be his last UK hit.

===1980s and later===
The 1980s found Dekker signed to a new label, [[Stiff Records]], an independent label that specialized in [[punk rock|punk]] and new wave acts as well as releases associated with the [[2 Tone (music genre)|2 Tone]] label, whose acts instigated a short-lived but influential ska revival. He recorded an album called ''Black & Dekker'' (1980), which featured his previous hits backed by [[Graham Parker & the Rumour|The Rumour]], [[Graham Parker]]'s backing band and [[Akrylykz]] (featuring [[Roland Gift]], later of [[Fine Young Cannibals]]).<ref name="Albums">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r856772|pure_url=yes}}|title=Allmusic ((( Black & Dekker > Credits )))}}</ref> A re-recorded version of "Israelites" was released in 1980 on the Stiff label, followed by other new recordings: Jimmy Cliff's "[[Many Rivers to Cross]]" and "Book of Rules". Dekker's next album, ''Compass Point'' (1981), was produced by [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]]. Despite declining sales, Dekker remained a popular live performer and continued to tour with The Rumour.<ref name="AMG"/>

In 1984 he was declared bankrupt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5018910.stm |title=Reggae legend Desmond Dekker dies |work=BBC News |date=26 May 2006 |access-date=3 June 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/52152/pages/9831/page.pdf "London Gazette Notice 29th May 1990"]. Retrieved 27 January 2013.</ref> Only a single live album was released in the late '80s.  In 1990 "Israelites" was used in a [[Maxell]] TV advert that became popular and brought the song and artist back to the attention of the general public. He collaborated with [[The Specials]] on the 1993 album, ''King of Kings'', which was released under Desmond Dekker and The Specials. ''King of Kings'' consists of songs by Dekker's musical heroes including [[Byron Lee]]; [[Theophilus Beckford]], [[Jimmy Cliff]], and his friend and fellow Kong label artist, Derrick Morgan.<ref name=KingofKings>{{cite web|title=Desmond Dekker And Specials, The– King of Kings|url=http://www.discogs.com/Desmond-Dekker-And-Specials-King-Of-Kings/release/921520|publisher=www.discogs.com|access-date=26 January 2013}}</ref> He also collaborated on a [[remix]] of "Israelites" with reggae artist [[Apache Indian (musician)|Apache Indian]].<ref name="AMG"/> In 2003 a reissue of ''[[The Harder They Come (soundtrack)#2003 reissue bonus disc|The Harder They Come]]'' soundtrack featured "Israelites" and "007 (Shanty Town)".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Harder They Come – Bonus Disc|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/release/the-harder-they-come-deluxe-edition-mr0000411544|publisher=www.allmusic.com|access-date=28 January 2013}}</ref>

Dekker died of a heart attack on 25 May 2006, at his home in [[Thornton Heath]] in the [[London Borough of Croydon]], England, aged 64<ref name="AMG"/> and was buried at [[Streatham Park Cemetery]]. He was preparing to headline a world music festival in [[Prague]]. Dekker was divorced and was survived by his son and daughter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.desmonddekker.com/ |title=Official Website |publisher=Desmond Dekker |access-date=3 June 2012}}</ref>
