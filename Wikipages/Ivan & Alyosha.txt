'''Ivan & Alyosha''', also known as I&A, is a folk-pop, indie, rock band from Seattle, Washington formed in 2007 by Tim Wilson and Ryan Carbary. They were later joined by Pete Wilson (Tim's brother) and Tim Kim and added Cole Mauro to complete the group. In 2009 the band was recognized nationally by NPR during coverage of [[SXSW]]. Ivan & Alyosha's songs are represented by [[Downtown Music Publishing]].

== Background ==

Ivan & Alyosha was formed by Tim Wilson and Ryan Carbary in 2007. The two met while working on other projects and soon found themselves working exclusively with each other. Together they decided to go into the studio to record. Their first release was an extended play, "The Verse, the Chorus," produced by Eli Thomson in [[Los Angeles, California]]. At the time the band did not have a name, but during a discussion about the nameless project Eli Thompson suggested "Ivan and Alyosha" from the '[[Brothers Karamazov]]'.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Leahey|first=Andrew|date=|title=Ivan & Alyosha {{!}} Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/ivan-alyosha-mn0001091393/biography|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-03|website=[[AllMusic]]|language=en-us}}</ref> The two original members were fans of the genre and the name stuck.<ref name="Spinner">{{cite web|url=http://www.spinner.com/2010/03/07/sxsw-2010-ivan-and-alyosha/|title=Ivan & Alyosha Interview: SXSW 2010|work=Spinner|last=Smith|first=Bethany|date=February 7, 2010|accessdate=July 22, 2010}}</ref> Ivan & Alyosha performed in Texas at SXSW 2010.

The band derives its name from two characters of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Fyodor Dostoevsky's]] masterwork [[The Brothers Karamazov]]. The two characters hold opposite views of the world. Ivan rejects God and toys with the idea that "all things are permitted", e.g. sin, and that God is dead. Alyosha on the other hand contends that all things are not permitted, and that this is evidence of God's existence. This is a [classic] clash of logical integrity, as both brothers have logically valid arguments, but only one can be right.

Tim and Ryan took roughly a year to write the record [[The Verse, the Chorus (EP)]]. Ivan & Alyosha spent a few weeks in Los Angeles tracking with Producer Eli Thompson and drummer [[Frank Lenz]] in October 2007. Spending six more months on the record mixing at Avast! 2 in Seattle, then mastering by [[T.W. Walsh]] in Boston their first release was finally ready. The extended play was released in March 2009.

Ivan and Alyosha was first nationally recognized by [[NPR]], and was highlighted in NPR's [[All Songs Considered]] SXSW 2010 preview,<ref name="NPR">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124493093|title=SXSW 2010 Preview|work=NPR|date=March 9, 2010|accessdate=July 25, 2010}}</ref> and were named one of NPR's top 100 of SXSW<ref name="NPR SXSW top 100">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124212838|title=The Austin 100: A SXSW 2010 Mix for 2010|work=NPR|date=March 2, 2010|accessdate=July 25, 2010}}</ref> In April, NPR's Song of the Day also featured Ivan & Alyosha, along with a review of their single "Easy to Love"<ref name="NPR song of the day">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126132430|title=Ivan & Alyosha: Love for the Loveable|work=NPR|last=Thompson|first=Stephen|date=April 20, 2010|accessdate=July 22, 2010}}</ref>
