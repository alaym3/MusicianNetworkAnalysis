==History==
===Pre–2008: Formation and prior endeavors===
[[File:Shm-logo 1.png|thumb|left|The Swedish House Mafia logo from its formation until the 2013 split]]
Before Swedish House Mafia, [[Axwell]], [[Steve Angello]], and [[Sebastian Ingrosso]] performed as solo DJs in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Angello and Ingrosso knew each other as children growing up in Stockholm,<ref name="SHM Bio">{{cite web|url=https://www.magneticmag.com/.amp/2015/05/swedish-house-mafia-bio/|title=Swedish House Mafia Bio - Magnetic Magazine|website=Magneticmag.com}}</ref> and would often collaborate under various aliases in their early careers. Collaborations with Axwell came later in the decade as the pair discovered the Swedish DJ by a chance meeting.<ref name="SHM Bio"/> Towards the mid 2000s Axwell, Angello, and Ingrosso found themselves often playing shows together, with fellow Swedish DJ [[Eric Prydz]] joining them for some shows. The name Swedish House Mafia came about after friends and fans began labelling the four as they played more and more shows together with the four being first officially referred to as "Swedish House Mafia" in March 2007 by the [[Winter Music Conference]].<ref name="Billboard Timeline">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/amp/articles/news/dance/8261433/swedish-house-mafia-timeline-history|title=The History of Swedish House Mafia: A Timeline|website=Billboard.com}}</ref> Eventually, the group officially adopted the name in late 2008, with Prydz deciding not to join the group, describing himself as a "control freak" in the studio who can't abide collaboration, even with close friends.<ref name="Billboard 2012">{{cite news | last1=Mason | first1=Kerry | title=Can EDM Maestro Eric Prydz Become a U.S. Star? | date=2012-09-29 | newspaper=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/485470/can-edm-maestro-eric-prydz-become-a-us-star | access-date=2016-06-17 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513064554/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/485470/can-edm-maestro-eric-prydz-become-a-us-star | archive-date=2016-05-13 }}</ref> Prydz announced he would be leaving the group, soon after the collective officially formed, in November 2008.<ref name="Billboard Timeline"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://inthemix.junkee.com/eric-prydz-talks-swedish-house-mafia-defection/10488|title=A Farewell From inthemix: Thanks For All The Memories|date=1 November 2018|website=Inthemix.junkee.com}}</ref>

In 2010, Swedish House Mafia signed a record deal with [[Universal Music Group|UMG]]'s [[Polydor Records]] (formerly [[Polygram]])<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sonika.fm/ |title=Sonika.FM |website=Sonika.FM |date=May 26, 2010 |access-date=May 30, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527180733/http://sonika.fm/ |archive-date=May 27, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jango.com/music/Swedish+House+Mafia/_full_bio?l=0 |title=Jango – Free Music – Internet Radio |website=Jango.com |access-date=May 30, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213812/http://www.jango.com/music/Swedish+House+Mafia/_full_bio?l=0 |archive-date=October 4, 2013 }}</ref> after a falling-out with previous record label [[EMI]], due to differing ideas. They released "[[One (Swedish House Mafia song)|One]]", their first official single under the name ''Swedish House Mafia'', on [[Beatport]] on May 2, 2010, where it achieved international success, charting at number 7 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The group followed this with an equally well-received vocal version featuring [[Pharrell Williams]], retitled "One (Your Name)".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://djz.com/featured_djs/swedish-house-mafia/|title=Swedish House Mafia Bio|website=DJZ.com|access-date=February 28, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403205855/http://djz.com/featured_djs/swedish-house-mafia/|archive-date=April 3, 2013}}</ref> Their next single, "[[Miami 2 Ibiza]]", with [[Tinie Tempah]], was released on October 1, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/miami-2-ibiza-single/id722219249|title=Miami 2 Ibiza - Single by Swedish House Mafia & Tinie Tempah on Apple Music|date=1 October 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230060222/https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/miami-2-ibiza-single/id722219249|archive-date=30 December 2017}}</ref> It charted at number 4 on the UK Chart<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/20101016/7501/|title=Official Singles Chart Top 100 - Official Charts Company|website=[[Official Charts Company]]}}</ref> and was featured on Tempah's debut studio album [[Disc-Overy]].

===2010: ''Take One'' documentary===
On November 29, 2010, Swedish House Mafia released their first DVD documentary called ''Take One''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youngrichandfakingit.com/nightlife/swedish-house-mafia-movie-take-one/ |title=NYC Nightlife Blog |website=Youngrichandfakingit.com |access-date=May 30, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314133612/http://www.youngrichandfakingit.com/nightlife/swedish-house-mafia-movie-take-one/ |archive-date=March 14, 2012 }}</ref> The movie was filmed over the course of 2 years, 253 gigs and 15 countries by Swedish directors Henrik Hanson & [[Christian Larson (director)|Christian Larson]]. He commented on ''Take One'' by saying "It's not narrated at all. It's just sequences of them and it's made into a story. It's all chronological. It's just me following them around and they become characters in their own film. It all happened pretty naturally because they are all such strong characters, all three of them."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1648866/20100928/swedish_house_mafia.jhtml |title=MTV Interview |website=Mtv.com |date=September 28, 2010 |access-date=May 30, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210081226/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1648866/20100928/swedish_house_mafia.jhtml |archive-date=December 10, 2010 }}</ref>

On May 2, 2019, Swedish House Mafia played the first of three shows at the [[Tele2 Arena]] in [[Stockholm]] as part of their 2019 tour — to be named ''[[Save the World Reunion Tour|Save the World]]'', after their 2011 single of the same name. The three nights saw a new stage design featuring wall-to-wall projection and a platform built into the stage. Their setup also changed adding drum samplers manned by Ingrosso and a synthesizer manned by Axwell on opposite sides of the stage, whilst Angello was in the middle with CDJs and all three meeting in the middle to a DJ. Approximately 120,000 people saw the group's first show since [[Ultra Music Festival|Ultra Miami]] 2018. Building on the promise of new music, two new IDs were played during the event. One, which has been given the working title "Underneath It All" featuring [[Mike Posner]] was expected to be their next single.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youredm.com/2019/05/02/see-swedish-house-mafias-first-set-since-their-reunion-at-ultra-2018-full-set/|title=See Swedish House Mafia's First Set Since Their Reunion At Ultra 2018 [FULL SET]|first=Matthew|last=Meadow|date=2 May 2019|website=Youredm.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://dancingastronaut.com/2019/05/swedish-house-mafias-reunion-officially-commences-in-stockholm-relive-the-full-performance/|title=Swedish House Mafia's reunion officially commences in Stockholm, relive the full performance|date=2 May 2019|website=Dancing Astronaut}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cultr.com/news/shm-stockholm|title=Swedish House Mafia Played Multiple New Tracks In Stockholm|website=CULTR}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://edm.com/.amp/news/swedish-house-mafia-tele2-arena-video-2019|title=Watch Swedish House Mafia's First Show of 2019 at the Tele2 Arena in Stockholm - EDM.com - The Latest Electronic Dance Music News, Reviews & Artists|website=Edm.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.edmtunes.com/2019/05/swedish-house-mafia-full-stockholm-day-1/|title=[Watch] Swedish House Mafia's Full Stockholm Day 1 Set + Photos|date=3 May 2019|website=Edmtunes.com}}</ref>

In the spring of 2006, Axwell and Steve Angello, under the Supermode alias, remixed [[Bronski Beat]]'s "[[Smalltown Boy]]", producing "Tell Me Why". In August 2007, Axwell teamed up with performer Max'C to create the track "[[I Found U]]", which peaked #6 in the UK Singles Chart.
Axwell has been producing remixes for other artists—mixes have included Usher's "Burn" (BMG), Room 5's "Make Luv" (Positiva), Clipse & Faith Evans "Ma, I Don't Love Her" (RCA), Stonebridge's "Put 'Em High" (Hed Kandi), N*E*R*D's single "Maybe" (Virgin), and more recently Hard-Fi's "Hard to Beat", Deep Dish's "Dreams", Pharrell's "Angel", Nelly Furtado's "Promiscuous" and Madonna's "Jump". In 2012, Axwell released the 'Axwell Mix' of the progressive house track, "In My Mind", which was originally released by [[Ivan Gough]] and [[Feenixpawl]] through Axtone.

[[File:Steve Angello 2015.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Steve Angello in 2015]]
{{Main|Steve Angello}}

In 2007 his remix with [[Laidback Luke]] of "[[Show Me Love (Robin S. song)|Show Me Love]]" by [[Robin S.]] was released on Data Records.
Angello produces under several different aliases. On his own, he has called himself Who's Who and released tracks called "Not So Dirty" and "Sexy Fuck". He often works closely with his childhood friend Sebastian Ingrosso on many projects. Aside from DJing together, they have also produced under the names Buy Now, Fireflies, General Moders, Mode Hookers, Outfunk, and The Sinners. Most recently, they released "Bodycrash" under their Buy Now alias, sampling the 1978 disco hit "[[Let's All Chant]]" by the Michael Zager group. The track was first played by Pete Tong on his Radio 1 show in late 2007. Eventually, the Dirty South remix of the tune leaked out onto the Internet in January 2008. The track has since received a much larger release via Positiva Records, also including the Laidback Luke remix.
He has produced with Eric Prydz under the name A&P Project. Also, he has created a track with his friend Axwell under the name Supermongo, later renamed Supermode. They made a cover of an old Bronski Beat track, calling it "Tell Me Why". This was released via Ministry of Sound's Data Records imprint in summer 2006.
Steve Angello's productions can mainly be classified as [[house music|house]] ("Summer Noize"), [[progressive house]] ("Yeah"), [[tech house]] ("Partouze") and [[electro house]] ("Raining Again"). He also owns his own record label, Size Records. Angello's brother, Antoine Josefsson, is a DJ and a producer who goes by the name [[AN21]].

{{Main|Eric Prydz}}
Eric Sheridan Prydz (born 19 July 1976), known for his 2004 hit single "[[Call on Me (Eric Prydz song)|Call on Me]]", rose to fame with the song and saw continued chart success with "[[Proper Education]]" in 2007, and "[[Pjanoo]]" in 2008. In 2016, he released his debut studio album, ''[[Opus (Eric Prydz album)|Opus]]''. In 2017, he won DJ of the Year at the [[Electronic Music Awards]] and was also nominated for Live Act of the Year. Although the "[[Call on Me (Eric Prydz song)|Call on Me]]" track made him immensely popular, Prydz has stopped playing it in his shows in an attempt to distance himself from it. In 2008, Prydz released the critically acclaimed single "Pjanoo", which topped the [[UK Dance Chart]].<ref>{{cite web|title=UK Dance Chart: Eric Prydz - Pjanoo|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/dance-singles-chart/20080831/104/|access-date=2017-04-14}}</ref> Together with [[Axwell]], [[Sebastian Ingrosso]] and [[Steve Angello]], Prydz formed a group of DJs that informally referred to themselves as the Swedish House Mafia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/281173/swedish-house-mafia/biography|title=Swedish House Mafia - Biography {{!}} Billboard|website=Billboard.com|access-date=2016-06-20}}</ref> When the group with the same name officially formed in late 2008, Prydz decided not to join his friends.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/eric-prydz-swedish-house-no-mafia-20130719|title=Eric Prydz: Swedish House, No Mafia|date=2013-07-19|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2016-06-20}}</ref> He has collaborated with Axwell under the name Axer<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youredm.com/2012/11/12/introducing-unsung-heroes-axer-axwell-eric-prydz-123-original-mix/ |title=Introducing Unsung Heroes!: AxEr [Axwell & Eric Prydz] - 123 (Original Mix) |date=2012-11-12 |website=Your EDM |language=en-US |access-date=2018-12-09}}</ref> and with Angello as A&P Project.<ref>{{Citation|last=TheSunbreathe|title=Steve Angello & Eric Prydz press.

The Pryda snare is a popular technique in [[house music|house]] and [[trance music]] consisting of using a compressed and sustained snare sample at the end of a bar. Commonly used to mark progressions in a song structure, it has been widely sampled in the electronic dance music world, notably by producers such as [[Martin Garrix]], [[Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike]], and [[W&W]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://splice.com/blog/pryda-snare/|title=The Pryda Snare; History and Recreating it|date=2014-09-23|website=Splice blog|access-date=2016-05-01}}</ref> On 21 May 2012, Prydz released his debut artist album, ''[[Eric Prydz Presents Pryda]]'', as a 3-disc album on [[Virgin Records]] ([[Astralwerks]] in the USA). Disc 1 is made up of new unreleased Pryda productions, which some fans may have heard as works in progress (including [[Old and Wise|Shadows]], Agag, Mighty Love, [[Polarkreis 18|Allein]] and the intro edit of Pjanoo). Discs 2 and 3 bring together many of the classic tracks from the Pryda catalogue, sequenced and continuously mixed by Prydz himself, including some of his special re-edits.<ref>{{cite web | title=Eric Prydz Presents: Pryda | website=EmiMusic.com | url=http://assets.emi.com/ericprydz/pryda/ | access-date=2012-03-21 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323205003/http://assets.emi.com/ericprydz/pryda/ | archive-date=March 23, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>
