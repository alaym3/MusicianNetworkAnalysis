'''Esperanza Emily Spalding''' (born October 18, 1984) is an American [[jazz]] [[bass guitar|bassist]], singer, songwriter, and composer. Her accolades include four [[Grammy Award]]s, a [[Boston Music Awards|Boston Music Award]], and a [[Soul Train Music Awards|Soul Train Music Award]].

A native of [[Portland, Oregon]], Spalding began playing music professionally in her childhood, performing as a violinist in the Chamber Music Society of Oregon at age five. She was later both self-taught and trained on a number of instruments, including guitar and bass. Her proficiency earned her academic scholarships to [[Portland State University]] and the [[Berklee College of Music]], both of which she attended, studying music.

Spalding released her first album, ''[[Junjo]]'', in 2006 on the Spanish label Ayva Musica, after which she signed with the independent American label [[Heads Up International|Heads Up]], who released her 2007 [[Esperanza (Esperanza Spalding album)|self-titled album]]. Her third studio album, ''[[Chamber Music Society]]'' (2010), was a commercial success, charting at number 34 on the ''[[Billboard 200]]'', and resulting in Spalding winning her first Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]]; Spalding was the first jazz artist to win in this category.<ref name="Allen">{{cite web |last1=Allen |first1=Floyd |title=Spalding has made history for winning best new artist award|work=[[International Business Times]] |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/112385/20110215/spalding-has-made-history-in-winning-best-new-artist-award.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713001210/http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/112385/20110215/spalding-has-made-history-in-winning-best-new-artist-award.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 13, 2011|date=July 13, 2011}}</ref> She saw further acclaim for her fourth release, ''[[Radio Music Society]]'' (2012), which earned the Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album|Best Jazz Vocal Album]], as well as the track "City of Roses" winning for [[Grammy Award for Best Arrangement, Instrumental and Vocals|Best Arrangement, Instrument and Vocals]].

After spending the following several years performing as a supporting band player, Spalding released her fifth studio album, a [[funk rock]]-inspired [[concept album]] titled ''[[Emily's D+Evolution]]'', co-produced by [[Tony Visconti]], on [[Concord Records]]. The following year, she released the album ''[[Exposure (Esperanza Spalding album)|Exposure]]'', which was limited to 7,777 copies. Her subsequent sixth studio record, ''[[12 Little Spells]]'', was released in 2019, and peaked at number one on ''Billboard's [[Top Jazz Albums]]''. The album also saw Spalding nominated for two Grammy Awards, winning in the Best Jazz Vocal Album category.

In addition to writing and performing music, Spalding has also worked as an instructor, first at the Berklee College of Music, beginning at age 20.
