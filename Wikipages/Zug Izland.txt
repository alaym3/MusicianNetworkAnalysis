'''Zug Izland''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], United States, currently signed to [[Psychopathic Records]]. The group sometimes refers to its fans as "[[juggalo|zuggalos]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zugizland.com/news/ |title=8th Annual Gathering of the Juggalos 2007 |access-date=2008-08-21 |year=2007 |publisher=[Zug Izland] - News |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015050024/http://www.zugizland.com/news/ |archive-date=October 15, 2008 }}</ref>

== Background ==
Zug Izland formed in 2001, named after [[Zug Island|an industrial site]] near [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]].<ref name="Loftus">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p554074|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography of Zug Izland |access-date=2008-08-22 |last=Loftus |first=Johnny |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> The band was formed by [[Insane Clown Posse]] member [[Violent J]] (Joseph Bruce) and Mike Puwal, out of Bruce's love of [[rock music]]. Bruce wanted to know what a "[[Juggalo]] Rock" band would sound like.<ref name=VJInterview>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/weird2/violentj/interview18.html |title=Violent J/Zug Izland: |publisher=Angelfire.com |access-date=2014-05-23}}</ref> Zug Izland's songs were written and developed during the recording of Insane Clown Posse's album ''[[The Wraith: Shangri-La]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smellslikemusic.com/artist/pages/zug.html |title=Zug Izland |publisher=Smellslikemusic.com |date=2003-01-28 |access-date=2014-05-23}}</ref>

Bruce and Puwal completed the basic tracks for two songs, but still required a lead singer. Bruce wanted a singer similar to [[Kurt Cobain]], [[Eddie Vedder]], [[Jim Morrison]] or [[Axl Rose]].<ref name=VJInterview/> Although Syn was sought by three other bands at the time, he joined Zug Izland as their official singer.<ref name=VJInterview/> The band broke onto the national competitive music scene in 2003 with their debut album, ''[[Cracked Tiles]]''.

The album peaked at No. 48 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] Heatseekers'' [[Billboard chart|chart]] and at No. 31 on the ''Top Independent Albums'' chart.<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r625101|pure_url=yes}} |title=Charts and awards for ''Cracked Tiles'' |access-date=2008-08-22 |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Zug Izland released a follow-up album ''[[3:33]]'' the 1st of June 2004. It peaked at No. 26 on the ''Top Heatseekers'' chart and at No. 22 on the ''Top Independent Albums'' chart.<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r693262|pure_url=yes}} |title=Charts and awards for ''3:33'' |access-date=2008-08-22 |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> The release of the ''3:33'' album amicably fulfilled [[Psychopathic Records]] contract with Zug Izland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.insaneclownposse.com/page.php?page_id=icp_news&month=9&year=2004 |title=Goodbye to Zug Izland |access-date=2008-08-21 |date=September 27, 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041011114529/http://www.insaneclownposse.com/page.php?page_id=icp_news&month=9&year=2004 |archive-date=2004-10-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

After parting ways with Psychopathic Records after the release of 3:33, Zug Izland began writing and recording songs for a new album entitled "Promised Land". The ill-fated album was never released however tracks 'Next To Me", "Lies" and "How Does it Feel" were released officially online with leaked songs "Promised land" and "Woke Up Screaming" surfacing online some time later. The Syn written and recorded "Chemical Girl" was also released via the official Zug Izland MySpace page, however it has also never featured on an album.

In 2005, Zug Izland recorded a cover of [[Pink Floyd]] classic "[[Another Brick In The Wall]]". The track was a crowd favourite that Zug Izland would often cover at their live shows. Re-working the lyrics, the new track took a "Juggalo" theme replacing Pink Floyd's child chorus with a group of angry Juggalos screaming "Hey! People! Leave Juggalos alone!" in reference to the Juggalo culture's misrepresentation in mainstream media. The finished track was made available through the ZugIzland.com, but never made available on an official release.

Following years of touring and various line up changes, Zug Izland reunited, and returned to Psychopathic Records, announcing plans to reissue ''Cracked Tiles'' record a new album and tour with Insane Clown Posse in promotion of ICP's ''[[The Mighty Death Pop!|Mighty Death Pop!]]'' album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faygoluvers.net/v5/2012/07/zug-izland-to-re-release-cracked-tiles-tour-with-icp-on-mighty-death-pop-tour/ |title=Zug Izland to re-release "Cracked Tiles", tour with ICP on Mighty Death Pop tour! |publisher=Faygoluvers |date=2012-07-18 |access-date=2014-05-23}}</ref><ref name="faygoluvers">{{cite web|url=http://www.faygoluvers.net/v5/2012/08/icp-twiztid-and-blaze-seminar-audio/ |title=ICP, Twiztid, and Blaze seminar audio! |publisher=Faygoluvers |date=2012-08-12 |access-date=2014-05-23}}</ref> In the December 21, 2012 edition of ''Hatchet Herald'', it was revealed that Zug Izland would release a "[[greatest hits]]" album, featuring three newly recorded songs recorded by Violent J and Mike Puwal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psychopathicrecords.com/hatchetherald/121221/mayan/index.html |title=Hatchet Herald |publisher=Psychopathicrecords.com |date=2012-12-21 |access-date=2014-05-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111152128/http://www.psychopathicrecords.com/hatchetherald/121221/mayan/index.html |archive-date=January 11, 2014 }}</ref>

In August 2013 Zug Izland's greatest hits compilation "Toxicology: Zug Izland's Dopest Bangers" was released on Psychopathic Records, their first official release since 3:33 in 2004. The album featured a collection of tracks from their debut album Cracked Tiles, three remastered songs from 3:33 and three new recordings. The new songs reverted to the writing/recording process of Cracked Tiles with Violent J of Insane Clown Posse writing lyrics and Mike P writing the music. According to Faygoluvers.net the line up is now Syn, Mike P, D-Lay & 2 Phat.

==Music style==
[[Allmusic]] reviewer Johnny Loftus describes Zug Izland's music style as incorporating elements of [[piano ballad]]s, [[Gothic rock|goth]], [[industrial music|industrial]] and [[electronic music]], [[nu metal]] and [[horror film]] scores.<ref name=zugreview>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r693262/review |title=Record Reviews, Streaming Songs, Genres & Bands |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> According to Loftus, "Zug Izland's sparer style [is] unique in an [[alternative metal|alt-metal]] climate of two-guitar lineups and monstrous [[Extended-range bass|six-string bass]] bottom ends."<ref  name=zugreview/>
