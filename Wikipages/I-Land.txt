[[BTS]] and [[TXT (band)|TXT]] appeared as guests on the last episode broadcast live with an earlier time slot, at 8:00 p.m. KST.<ref>{{Cite web|last=손|first=봉석|date=September 12, 2020|title='아이랜드'(I_LAND) 남궁민, 파이널 무대 향한 마지막 경쟁 몰입력 높이는 진행|url=https://sports.donga.com/article/all/20200912/102904250/2|access-date=September 12, 2020|website=스포츠경향}}</ref>

==Concept==
22{{Efn|Formerly 23 until episode 6.|name=|group=lower-alpha}} participants are transported to a complex (called by the same name as the show title, the I-Land) located in the middle of nowhere surrounded by a luscious green forest, for a total of 113 days.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-06-24|title=Mnet promises impartiality in new audition program with Big Hit|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/art/2020/08/732_291757.html|access-date=2020-08-25|website=koreatimes|language=en}}</ref> The participants will live in a 3-floor complex with modern living spaces, gym, dance studios, item room (for storage), and individual practice rooms; however, only 12 contestants can stay there. The remaining others will be on the "Ground", which is a simple building with a dance studio and dining area, and the trainees assigned to the Ground have to commute to and from the building every day at set times. The two sections are connected through a gate and a stage, where their skills will be tested. A key part of the concept is that, the participants' and producers' votes play a heavy role in the show, as they decide through voting who will stay in I-Land and who will go down to the Ground. A fixed number of 12 trainees will be in the I-Land, but they may be dropped and demoted to the Ground (and promptly be replaced by trainees from the Ground).

While the show primarily focuses on the trainees and producers votes,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Benjamin|first=Jeff|title=How Big Hit Entertainment & CJ ENM's 'I-Land' Program Can Create The 'Next Generation Of K-Pop'|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbenjamin/2020/06/30/i-land-big-hit-entertainment-cj-enm-review/|access-date=2020-08-25|website=Forbes|language=en}}</ref> the audience would be able to vote on who remains in the I-Land in the last part of part 1 of the show, and based on this, the show will eliminate all trainees in the Ground. From there, the I-Landers will compete among themselves in the second part of the series to determine who will debut in the final debut team of 7 members. The producers and audience are the only ones who can vote.<ref>{{Cite web|title=[종합]방시혁X비X지코 뭉친 '아이랜드', 진화된 오디션으로 Mnet 신뢰 회복할까|url=https://www.mk.co.kr/star/broadcasting-service/view/2020/06/646888/|access-date=2020-07-25|website=스타투데이|language=ko}}</ref> Thus, the show was originally supposed to focus on trainee and producer votes without much audience influence, but in part 2 of the show, the trainees did not vote at all, and global votes were introduced.

[[File:I-LAND (Mnet & tvN) logo.png|thumb|The I-LAND logo (retouched)]]

[[Namkoong Min]] serves as the official host, as well as the commentator/narrator of the program. The contestants are evaluated and judged by three producers: main producer [[Bang Si-hyuk]], CEO of Big Hit Music, South Korean singer [[Rain (entertainer)|Rain]] and rapper [[Zico (rapper)|Zico]], who are prominent figures in [[K-pop]] and [[Korean hip hop|K-hip hop]] of the early 21st century respectively. Rain and Zico will also act as mentors and train the participants.

A first in Korean survival programs, a [[Big Brother (franchise)|Big Brother]]-style live cams titled, ''I-LAND Cam,'' features 1-hour [[video on demand]] multi-camera footage inside the I-Land and Ground. New videos are released every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday on the [[Weverse]] app and on its website.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-07-03|title=Enter The I-Land With Big Hit and CJENM's New Show|url=https://thehoneypop.com/2020/07/02/enter-the-i-land-with-big-hit-and-cjenms-new-show/|access-date=2020-08-25|website=The Honey POP|language=en-US}}</ref> On the last week of I-LAND, ''I-LAND Cams'' are live streamed real-time every day for an hour starting at 6PM KST, while on the final day of I-LAND, same day as the final episode, ''I-LAND Cams'' are live streamed real-time at 5AM KST.

== System ==

=== Part 1 ===
Introduced in Episode 2, there is a system in place based on a scoring system out of 100. Each of the I-Landers are evaluated individually and given a score from 0–100. These scores are then displayed anonymously so that any particular individual's score is unknown, and then averaged to get the '''team score'''. Based on the team score, a certain number of I-Landers will have to be moved to the Ground and be replaced.

In episode 3, a separate "teamwork" score was also given and factored into the overall average score.

== Missions ==

=== Part 1 ===

==== Entry test ====
Trainees that came together or alone must perform in this test. Every other contestant must raise their hands to judge whether they are worth to be on the I-LAND. If a trainee received 12 or more votes, they are allowed to be on the I-Land. If not, they will be on the Ground. There is no limit to the count, but if there are more than 12 contestants after the whole test, the remaining contestants must pick one or more contestants to be moved out to the Ground until there are 12 contestants remaining.

==== Theme song ====
Trainees begin their first official mission with the theme "'''encounter'''"; the trainees are just getting to know each other. The contestants on the I-Land and the Ground must perform the show's theme song "Into The I-LAND" (original version by [[IU (singer)|IU)]]. There are 12 parts in this song and each trainee must pick which part they want to perform. The I-Land contestants will be evaluated individually by the producers and directors, and the average score of all of them will correspond to the number of contestants needed to move out from the I-Land.{{efn|See [[#System|System]]}} The Ground contestants will each submit a performance video daily to be reviewed by the producers and directors to determine who will replace the eliminated contestants from the I-Land, but they will not have an actual performance on stage.

Lee Hee-seung was appointed the leader and the part 1 position by the contestants but later gave up both positions to Ni-ki. Rain evaluated their performance two days before their mission. The I-Landers received an average score of 59 (from contestants individual scores) and therefore have to choose 6 contestants to be moved out from the I-Land.

==== Teamwork ====
Their second mission is designed to test and develop their '''teamwork'''. Both the I-Landers and the Grounders will perform a remix of "[[Fire (BTS song)|Fire]]" by [[BTS]]. They are given 6 days to prepare. The same scoring system will be used; however, the highest individual scorer in I-Land will be given a dropout exemption card, which can be used on any of the I-Landers, including himself. If the card is used, the next dropout candidate will automatically be eliminated. If there are no dropouts from I-Land in this round, the Grounders will not be able to perform at all.

Jay and Ni-ki became the leaders of the Grounders, while Hee-seung is the leader for the I-Landers. 2 days before the test, Rain and DOOBU evaluated the Grounders while Zico, Pdogg and Son Sung-deuk evaluated the I-Landers as a midpoint check. The I-Landers received a teamwork score of 80 and had an average of 78 and therefore have to choose 4 contestants to be moved out from the I-Land.

K received the highest score and, thus, the dropout exemption card. He used it to save Yang Jung-won from being dropped out of I-Land. Yang Jung-won being saved makes the next contestant, Ta-ki to move out from I-Land. They both have 5 votes but Ta-ki has a higher individual score than Jung-won so he was originally saved from being dropped out.

==== Representative Unit ====
Their third mission is picking representatives for '''vocal and dance battle''' between I-Land and Ground to test their sacrifice and ability to directly compete. If Ground wins, 6 contestants will be dropped out from I-Land. If I-Land wins, no contestants will be dropped out. They are given 6 days to prepare. Rain and Son Sung-deuk evaluated the I-Landers while Zico, Pdogg, and DOOBU evaluated the Grounders as a midpoint check, 3 days before the test. I-Land won the battle; therefore no I-Landers will be dropped out.

==== The Final 12 ====
The fourth and last mission of the first part of the show will decide the '''final 12 contestants'''. They will be performing a new original song titled, ''"I&credible"'' with the theme, '''"Awakening"'''. Like the theme song, there are 12 parts in this song and each trainee must pick which part they want to perform. They are given 7 days to prepare. Rain and Son Sung-deuk evaluated the Grounders while Zico, Pdogg, and DOOBU evaluated the I-Landers as a midpoint check. Jay and Jake help the I-Landers with the details of the choreography, and Ni-ki helps the Grounders.

From the I-Land, 3 contestants will be voted out by the I-Landers themselves and another 3 from the producers. 6 members from the Ground (including the dropped out I-Landers) who will fill up the 6 spots in I-Land will be picked by the global fans through voting. The 6 remaining I-Landers will automatically continue to the second part of the show.

After the eliminated I-Landers arrive in the Ground, they must perform again with the Grounders, they are given 3 days to redistribute parts and to prepare.

K, Lee Hee-seung, Park Sung-hoon, Yang Jung-won, Jake, and Jay are saved from being dropped out, thus, they will continue on to the second part of I-Land.

=== Part 2 ===

==== BTS Test ====
The first test of the 2nd part of I-LAND and the final 12 contestants is '''performing songs of [[BTS]]'''. The 12 contestants are divided into 3 units with each one performing a song by BTS. The group gave the mission themselves, recorded in the living room of I-Land while the contestants watched from the lobby. The producers will pick the contestant who will be eliminated based on individual scoring. The unit with the highest score will be exempted from elimination, if the contestant with the lowest score is in the first rank unit, the next member with the lowest score will be eliminated from I-LAND. They are given 7 days to prepare. Son Sung-deuk and DOOBU evaluated the I-Landers as a midpoint check.

Choreographer Bae Yoon Jung and Son Sung-deuk appeared to give a mini-mission which is a freestyle dance battle, the ranks 1-3 will be the leader of the group and will choose if they want to pick their members in the unit or choose a song.

The Fake Love unit ranked first. Ta-ki, who's part of the unit, received the lowest individual score but was saved from being eliminated. Lee Geon-u, who placed 11th, was eliminated instead.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-08-22|title='I-LAND' 이희승, 'BTS 테스트' 1등… 12등 타키 기사회생→11등 이건우 탈락|url=http://enews.imbc.com/News/RetrieveNewsInfo/290866|access-date=2020-08-25|website=iMBC 연예|language=ko}}</ref> The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd rank will be spending a day of freedom outside I-Land doing different activities.

They will be covering two songs of [[Seventeen (South Korean band)|Seventeen]] which are [[Love & Letter|Pretty U]] and [[An Ode|HIT]]. They are given a day to practice. [[The8]], [[Wen Junhui|Jun]], Dino and Hoshi of Seventeen came to I-Land to administer the mini-mission themselves. Team "Pretty U" won the mini-mission. Kim Sun-oo won first place and will pick his chosen song and members.

The contestants then will be divided into two groups and will be performing new singles, "Chamber 5 (Dream of Dreams)" as a '''refreshing concept''' and "Flame On" as '''explosion concept'''. The producers will pick the contestant who will be eliminated based on individual scoring. The 11th place contestant will participate in the mini-mission and practice for the concept test but will not be performing it in front of the producers.

Park Sung-hoon and Kim Sun-oo were appointed leaders of the teams. Ta-ki placed 11th place in the global votes for the Chemistry Test, thus, he was eliminated. Kim Sun-oo replaced Ta-ki with Park Sung-hoon in his group. K replaced Park Sung-hoon as being the leader of "Flame On". They are given 5 days to practice. Son Sung-deuk evaluated both teams as a midpoint check.

The top 6 trainees will be selected from global votes while one trainee will be chosen by the producers. They will be performing a new single titled, "Calling (Run Into You)" during the live broadcast. Son Sung-deuk and DOOBU evaluated the I-Landers as a midpoint check.

The I-Landers will also get to film their own PR video. The duration of their video will be based on their ranking. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd rank will get 60, 50, and 40 seconds, respectively, while the rest will have 30 seconds.

The 13 eliminated trainees came to I-LAND and they reunited with the current contestants to practice their first song, "Into The I-LAND" together and perform it during the live broadcast for the first time.

The debut group name is '''"Enhypen"''', from the symbol [[Hyphen]] (-) it creates new meanings including ''Connection, Discovery, & Growth.'' The final line-up are Yang Jung-won, Jay, Jake, Niki, Lee Hee-seung, Park Sung-hoon, with Kim Sun-oo as the producer's pick.
