'''Pat Carroll''' (born 1946 in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (state)|VIC]]) is an [[Australia]]n singer in the 1960s and early 1970s, she is probably best known for her television appearances and her collaboration with [[Olivia Newton John]].

==Biography and career ==
Carroll began her entertainment career at age eight when she started taking singing and dancing lessons. Appearances on children's TV shows followed by the time she was eleven years old. She continued by appearing in musical comedy shows such as ''Carnival'' and ''Bye Bye Birdie''.

This led to appearing on national Australian pop TV shows such as ''[[Bandstand (Australia)|Bandstand]]'' and ''[[The Go!! Show]]'' when in her mid-teens. Her first 45 single "He's My Guy" was released when she was 18.
 
In the mid-1960s Carroll and her friend Olivia Newton-John formed a singing duo called ''Pat and Olivia'' (see YouTube). Having won a song contest in Melbourne, they travelled to the United Kingdom. They achieved some success there on TV and in the clubs.  After a period of performing there, Carroll's visa expired, forcing her to return to Australia where she would eventually marry ex-[[The Strangers (Australian band)|Strangers]] member, [[John Farrar]].  Newton-John stayed on and launched her own international career.

Carroll released a number of singles with [[W&G Records]] and Interfusion during the 1960s and early 1970s most of which failed to chart. Her most successful single in Australia was her cover of [[Dana Rosemary Scallon|Dana]]'s [[Eurovision Song Contest 1970|1970 Eurovision winner]] "[[All Kinds of Everything]]".  However Carroll's best known single is "To the Sun" on account of its featuring [[Cliff Richard]] on backing vocals.

At about 1970, Farrar quit the Strangers and with Carroll, returned to London. During 70s and 80s, she often sang backing vocals on Olivia Newton-John's albums.

Currently living in [[Malibu, CA]] (USA) with husband John Farrar: her first son [[Sam Farrar]] (born 29 June 1978) is the bass player of American rock'n'roll band [[Phantom Planet]]. Her 2nd son [[Max Farrar]] is the keyboardist/guitarist of the rock 'n' roll band Azura.
