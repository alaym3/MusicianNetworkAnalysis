His first big success was with the single "7 godina", written by himself and Leontina Vukomanović. The song went to No. 1 on the Serbian pop music charts, and became very popular in other [[SFR Yugoslavia|former Yugoslav]] countries.

In 1999 he won his first big prize when becoming the Grand Prix winner of the International Festival of Arts [[Slavianski Bazaar in Vitebsk|Slavianski Bazaar]] in [[Vitebsk]], [[Belarus]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-12-10|title=Belarus: Slavianski Bazaar 2020 Selection - Vitebsk Results|url=https://eurovoix-world.com/2019/12/10/belarus-slavianski-bazaar-2020-selection-vitebsk-results/|access-date=2020-09-01|website=Eurovoix World|language=en-GB}}</ref>
