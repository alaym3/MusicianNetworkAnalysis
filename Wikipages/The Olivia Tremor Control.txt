'''The Olivia Tremor Control''' is an American [[Psychedelic music|psychedelic]] band from [[Athens, Georgia]]. The band's main line-up comprised [[Will Cullen Hart]], [[Bill Doss]], Eric Harris, [[John Fernandes]], and Peter Erchick. The Olivia Tremor Control's music encompasses a wide range of styles, including [[indie rock]], [[neo-psychedelia]], [[psychedelic pop]] and [[psychedelic rock]]. Among the band's more prominent influences include psychedelic pop bands of the 1960s, such as [[the Beach Boys]] and [[the Beatles]]. Their lyrics are often surreal and optimistic, and focus on large concepts such as self-improvement and identity.

The Olivia Tremor Control originated as a band called Cranberry Lifecycle, which was formed in [[Ruston, Louisiana]] in the late 1980s, by Hart and his high school friend and [[Jeff Mangum]]. Doss joined during this period, and after moving [[Athens, Georgia]], the band was renamed to Synthetic Flying Machine, then to the Olivia Tremor Control in 1993. Mangum left the band, and was replaced by Harris, Ferandes, and Erchick. With this line-up, the Olivia Tremor Control released two albums: ''[[Music from the Unrealized Film Script: Dusk at Cubist Castle|Dusk at Cubist Castle]]'' (1996) and ''[[Black Foliage: Animation Music Volume One|Black Foliage]]'' (1999). Both albums received positive reviews from critics.

After the release of ''Black Foliage'', tensions grew between Hart and Doss, and the Olivia Tremor Control broke up in 2000. Hart was hospitalized with [[multiple sclerosis]] in 2005, and when Doss went to visit him, the two reconciled and reunited the band in 2009. While recording a third album, Doss died of a reported [[aneurysm]]. The remaining band members decided to continuing performing, and as of 2019 the Olivia Tremor Control's third album is still being recorded.

==History==
===Early years===
The Olivia Tremor Control originated as a [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] band called Cranberry Lifecycle.{{sfn|Cooper|2005|p=17}} This band was formed in [[Ruston, Louisiana]] in the late 1980s, by high school friends [[Will Cullen Hart]] and [[Jeff Mangum]]. It was one of the many [[home recording]] projects they created with their friends [[Bill Doss]] and [[Robert Schneider]].{{sfn|Cooper|2005|p=17}} The four friends exchanged recordings among each other, and the constant stream of [[cassette tape]]s within their group led to the formation of a [[musical collective]] known as [[Elephant 6]].{{sfn|Shook Jr.|2013}} Musician Ross Beach describes Cranberry Lifecycle as the Elephant 6's "first collaboration of 'serious' songs."{{sfn|Cooper|2005|p=17}}

After high school, Doss, Hart, and Mangum moved to [[Athens, Georgia]], as they were drawn to the city's burgeoning [[Music of Athens, Georgia|music scene]].{{sfn|Cooper|2005|pp=24–25}} Cranberry Lifecycle was renamed to Synthetic Flying Machine, and the lineup consisted of Hart on electric guitar, Doss on bass guitar, and Mangum on drums.{{sfn|Cooper|2005|p=25}}{{efn|Beach also identifies Hart's then-girlfriend as a member of the band, but did not specify her role.{{sfn|Heater|2006}}}} The band gained a small following due in part to the psychedelic-infused music, which was different from the prevalent [[grunge]] sound in the city.{{sfn|Cooper|2005|pp=25–26}} Synthetic Flying Machine was later renamed the Olivia Tremor Control, and this band played its first live show in 1993.{{sfn|Heater|2006}} Mangum suggested the name, which was intended to be a [[surrealism|surreal]] sounding phrase with no further meaning.{{sfn|Kramer|n.d.|p=3}}{{efn|Doss offered a different explanation of the band name in 1998, stating: "It refers to two friends, Jacqueline and Olivia, who were separated during the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|California earthquake of 1906]] and have been searching for each other ever since, across different dimensions of time and space."{{sfn|Holmes|1998|p=03}}}}

The first Olivia Tremor Control release was the [[extended play]] (EP) ''[[California Demise]]'' in 1994.{{sfn|Kitching|2019}} Music critic Nig Hodgkins wrote: "''California Demise'' introduced the trademark splintered sound, complete with guitar effects and Beach Boys vocal harmonizing."{{sfn|Buckley|2003|p=749}} After ''California Demise'', Mangum left the group, and would go on to form [[Neutral Milk Hotel]].{{sfn|Hermes|1998|p=24}} Doss and Hart then recruited multi-instrumentalists [[John Fernandes]] and Eric Harris, and keyboardist Peter Erchick.{{sfn|Anon.|2016}} During this period, the Olivia Tremor Control released the 1994 [[split album|split single]] ''[[The Olivia Tremor Control/The Apples in Stereo]]'' with [[the Apples in Stereo]], and the 1996 EP ''The Giant Day''.{{sfn|Anon.|n.d.}}

===''Music from the Unrealized Film Script: Dusk at Cubist Castle''===
Doss and Hart had been working on songs for a studio album as early as 1993.<ref>{{harvnb|Anon.|1996}}; {{harvnb|Anon.|2016}}.</ref> Doss' ideas were more [[pop music|pop]] friendly while Hart wrote more experimental songs.{{sfn|Anon.|2016}} ''[[Stereogum]]'' compared their dichotomous partnership to [[Lennon–McCartney]] of [[the Beatles]].{{sfn|Anon.|2016}} In 1995, the Olivia Tremor Control went to [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]] to record their debut album, ''[[Music from the Unrealized Film Script: Dusk at Cubist Castle]]'' (commonly shortened to ''Dusk at Cubist Castle'').{{sfn|Anon.|2016}} It was recorded at [[Pet Sounds Studio]], and was produced by Schneider.{{sfn|Anon.|2016}}

At 74 minutes in length with 27 songs, ''Dusk at Cubist Castle'' was a large undertaking.<ref>{{harvnb|Houle|2011}}; {{harvnb|Anon.|2016}}.</ref> It was intended to be the [[soundtrack]] to an unmade film, and thus covers a wide range of genres, including psychedelia, [[krautrock]], [[noise music]], and [[folk-rock]].{{sfn|Ankeny|n.d.}} ''Dusk at Cubist Castle'' was released in August 1996, by Flydaddy Records.{{sfn|Anon.|2016}} Early CD pressings included a second album titled ''[[Explanation II: Instrumental Themes and Dream Sequences]]''.{{sfn|Anon.|n.d.}} This album contains nine [[ambient music|ambient]] songs, and in the [[liner notes]] it is suggested to play the two albums in synchronicity, as this would create [[quadraphonic sound]].<ref>{{harvnb|Anon.|1998}}; {{harvnb|Houle|2011}}.</ref>{{efn|Playing ''Dusk at Cubist Castle'' and ''Explanation II'' in synchronicity does not produce quadraphonic sound, as the two albums are of different lengths.{{sfn|Houle|2011}}}} The songs "The Opera House" and "Jumping Fences" were released as [[single (music)|singles]].{{sfn|Anon.|n.d.}} To promote the album, the Olivia Tremor Control served as an [[Opening act|opener]] for [[Beck]], and toured with [[Gorky's Zygotic Mynci]] in 1998.{{sfn|Buckley|2003|p=749}}

''Dusk at Cubist Castle'' received positive reviews from critics.<ref>{{harvnb|Anon.|2016}}; {{harvnb|Kitching|2019}}.</ref> Jason Cohen of ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' described the album as "intricate, gorgeous," but suggested the experimental noise songs could have been removed to enhance the quality.{{sfn|Cohen|1996}} Tom Cox of ''[[NME]]'' praised the genre hybridity, writing: "These men are experts at combining the absurd with the uplifting. In amongst the narcotic noisiness they scatter mouth-watering snatches of Beach Boy-type pop primed to keep boredom down to an absolute minimum."{{sfn|Cox|n.d.}} It ranked at number 37 on ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'s}} year-end [[Pazz & Jop]] critics' poll.{{sfn|Anon.|1997}}

===''Black Foliage: Animation Music Volume One''===
In the liner notes for ''Dusk at Cubist Castle'', the Olivia Tremor Control asked fans to mail [[cassette tapes]] of themselves describing their dreams.{{sfn|Deusner|2019}} These tapes would serve as the basis for band's second album ''[[Black Foliage: Animation Music Volume One]]'' (commonly shortened to ''Black Foliage'').{{sfn|Jacks|1998|p=59}} The Olivia Tremor Control wanted to explore the concept of dreams, and how dreams are an emulation of life with small deviations, such as going to work naked.{{sfn|Kramer|n.d.|p=4}} ''Black Foliage'' was recorded at Pet Sounds Studio, and Schneider once again served as the producer.{{sfn|Kitching|2019}}

Hart was influened by the electric sound of the 1969 album ''[[An Electric Storm]]'', which led him to splice the traditional compositions the band members had been writing with experimental electronic pieces.{{sfn|Kitching|2019}} These splices became an important [[Motif (music)|musical motif]] for ''Black Foliage''.{{sfn|Kitching|2019}} The album does not feature musical pauses or [[Fade (audio engineering)|fade]], and many songs eschew [[verse–chorus form]].{{sfn|Deusner|2019}} Stephen Deusner of ''Stereogum'' wrote: "''Black Foliage'' thrives on the contrast between rigidly constructed pop music and loosely structured experiments, between logic and intuition. Pop is controlled; noise is uncontrolled. Rather than a simple binary, however, the contrast between these two musical poles creates a static/signal ratio that is always shifting."{{sfn|Deusner|2019}}

''Black Foliage'' was released on March 23, 1999, by Flydaddy Records.{{sfn|Anon.|2020|p=2}} It was preceeded by the 1997 EP ''[[Those Sessions]]''.{{sfn|Bjorge|n.d.}}

===Breakup, reunion, and the death of Doss===
After the release of ''Black Foliage'', tensions began to grow between Doss and Hart.{{sfn|Allen|2011}} According to Doss, Hart wanted to take a hiatus from music, and was suffering from early symptoms of then-undiagnosed [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS).{{sfn|Allen|2011}} The two had a falling out, and the Olivia Tremor Control broke up in 2000.<ref>{{harvnb|Bogdanov|Erlewine|Woodstra|2001|p=292}}; {{harvnb|Allen|2011}}</ref> The last album to be released during this period was ''[[Singles and Beyond]]'', a [[compilation album]] featuring some of the band's rare and out of print songs.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Erlewine|Woodstra|2001|p=292}} Doss and Hart worked on other projects in the interim; Doss recorded music for his solo project [[The Sunshine Fix]] and was a member of the Apples in Stereo, while Hart formed the band [[Circulatory System (band)|Circulatory System]].{{sfn|Shook Jr.|2013}}

[[File:Bill Doss 2010.jpg|thumb|right|Bill Doss in 2010]]
Around 2005, Hart's condition with MS was worsening, and he was admitted to a hospital.{{sfn|Allen|2011}} After receiving the news, Doss decided to reconcile with Hart, and the members of Olivia Tremor Control started playing music with each other on a regular basis.{{sfn|Allen|2011}} After a brief reunion performance at the 2005 [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] festival, the Olivia Tremor Control scheduled more concerts over the next few years.{{sfn|Thiessen|2009}} Fernandes said: "When we got the offer to play [All Tomorrow's Parties] we were thinking about playing a few shows here and there, because everybody still lives here in town ... That went so well that we decided to do a few more."{{sfn|Heater|2006}} The Olivia Tremor Control announced an official reunion in 2009, and released two songs over the next two years: "North Term Reality" and "The Game You Play Is in Your Head, Parts 1, 2, & 3."<ref>{{harvnb|Breihan|2010}}; {{harvnb|Fitzmaurice|2011}}</ref>

On July 31, 2012, the band announced the death of Doss at the age of 43.{{sfn|Battan|2012}} ''[[Atlanta (magazine)|Atlanta]]'' reports the cause of death was an [[aneurysm]].{{sfn|Peisner|2018}} Prior to his death, the Olivia Tremor Control was recording music for an untitled album.{{sfn|Kitching|2019}} The remaining members decided to continue performing as the Olivia Tremor Control, and as of 2019, the album is still being recorded.<ref>{{harvnb|Shook Jr.|2013}}; {{harvnb|Kitching|2019}}</ref> Hart states it will be the band's final album, and said: "It is still being worked on, we're kind of slow with it ... We have three sides worth of songs done, though they're not sequenced properly yet to run three sides."{{sfn|Kitching|2019}}

==Artistry==
The Olivia Tremor Control's music encompasses a wide range of styles, including [[indie rock]], [[neo-psychedelia]], [[psychedelic pop]] and [[psychedelic rock]].<ref>{{harvnb|Houle|2011}}; {{harvnb|Bogdanov|Erlewine|Woodstra|2001|p=292}}; {{harvnb|Anon.|2016}}</ref> In regards to the band's dynamic sound, Paul Thompson of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' wrote: "Olivias' all-encompassing sound, some unthinkable matchup of ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]''-era [[The Beatles|Beatles]] or ''[[Smile (Beach Boys album)|Smile]]''-era [[The Beach Boys|Beach Boys]], the tornado-alley skronk of 1980s [[The Flaming Lips|Flaming Lips]] and [[The Butthole Surfers|Butthole Surfers]], and the surreal wooze of post-[[Steve Reich|Reichian]] tape manipulation."{{sfn|Thompson|2011}} Music critic Nig Hodgkins notes that the Olivia Tremor Control incorporate many elements found in psychedelic music of the 1990s, including: [[Reverse echo|backwards guitar echo]], [[Phase music|phasing]], dreamy vocals, and electronic sound effects.{{sfn|Buckley|2003|p=749}}

An important influence to the Olivia Tremor Control are the psychedelic pop bands of the 1960s, such as the Beach Boys and the Beatles.{{sfn|Kramer|n.d.|p=1}} Hart said: "They were great ... The singing was amazing and that's a big interest for us. And a lot of the way that they blended trickery and interesting sounds with pop."{{sfn|Kramer|n.d.|p=1}} Hart notes that the band members attempt to expand on the sound of 1960s psychedelic pop with modern recording technology, creating more holistic songs and avoiding what he calls "hippie [[jam session]]s."{{sfn|Kramer|n.d.|p=1}} Other influences include the recording techniques used by [[Musique concrète]] musicians like [[Pierre Henry]] and [[John Cage]], as well as 1990s indie rock bands like [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] and [[Sebadoh]].{{sfn|Allen|2011}}
