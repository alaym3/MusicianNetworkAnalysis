==History==

=== Beginning (''Ti lascio una canzone'') (2009–10)===
In 2009, Piero Barone, Ignazio Boschetto and Gianluca Ginoble were among the teens competing in the Italian televised singing competition ''[[Ti lascio una canzone]]'', held at the [[Teatro Ariston]] in [[Sanremo]] and broadcast by [[Rai 1]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2015/febbraio/10/Due_tenori_baritono_Volo_sogna_co_0_20150210_edc57fa2-b0f2-11e4-8e27-51d82bf3e5e9.shtml|work=[[Corriere della Sera]]|language=it|access-date=21 February 2015|title=Due tenori e un baritono "Il Volo" sogna la vittoria|author=Andrea Laffranchi|date=10 February 2015}}</ref> During the first episodes, they performed several songs as solo artists. Among the others, Gianluca Ginoble's rendition of "[[Il mare calmo della sera (song)|Il mare calmo della sera]]", originally by [[Andrea Bocelli]], won the first episode of the show, and later came in first place during the final held on 2 May 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.roseto.te.it/comunicati.php?id=457|publisher=[[Roseto degli Abruzzi|Comune di Roseto degli Abruzzi]]|date=3 May 2009|archive-date=21 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221171331/http://www.comune.roseto.te.it/comunicati.php?id=457|title=Gianluca vince la seconda edizione di Ti lascio una canzone. Montepulciano e Roseto in festa}}</ref> 
Director and creator of the show, Roberto Cenci, had the idea to put them together, with the purpose to create a trio similar to [[The Three Tenors]] ([[Plácido Domingo]], [[José Carreras]] and [[Luciano Pavarotti]]).<ref name="Rockol Renis Interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockol.it/news-641830/il-volo-intervista-esclusiva-a-tony-renis-nuovo-album-bocell?refresh_ce|publisher=Rockol.it|language=it|title=Esclusiva: Tony Renis racconta la vera storia de Il Volo (e torna con Bocelli)|author=Gianni Sibilla|date=11 February 2015}}</ref> During the fourth episode of the show, they performed together for the first time, singing Neapolitan classic song "[[’O sole mio]]".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rai.tv/dl/RaiTV/programmi/media/ContentItem-534e3df6-f01a-4d2a-b7ce-aa9f820dbdc4.html  | publisher = [[RAI]] | access-date = 28 June 2011 | title = Ti lascio una canzone 2009 – 'O sole mio}}</ref><ref name="Repubblica August 2013">{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/spettacoli/musica/2013/08/19/news/il_volo-64969227/|work=[[la Repubblica]]|language=it|access-date=21 February 2015|date=19 August 2013|title=Il Volo, tour americano e un film per la Disney.

While in [[Los Angeles]], Italian singer-songwriter and music producer [[Tony Renis]] casually discovered their performance through [[Rai International]]. 
Impressed by the trio, he decided to call Cenci to arrange a meeting with them. Since they were under the age of 18, Cenci talked with the singers' families, and they decided to trust Renis' proposal to work with him.<ref name="Rockol Renis Interview"/>
Thanks to lawyer Peter Lopez, Renis met with [[Geffen Records]]' [[Jimmy Iovine]] and [[Ron Fair]] and they offered a recording deal to the group, which allowed them to become the first Italian artists to directly sign with an American recording label.<ref name="Rockol Renis Interview"/><ref name="Il Volo debut Rockol">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockol.it/news-183967/esce-l-album-de-il-volo-destinazione-lo-stardom-internazionale|publisher=Rockol.it|language=it|title=Esce l'album de Il Volo: destinazione lo stardom internazionale?|date=29 November 2010}}</ref> Producer Michele Torpedine started to work with them as a manager.<ref name="Repubblica August 2013"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/471513/il-volo-transitions-from-italian-tv-to-american-idol|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=21 February 2015|title=Il Volo Transitions from Italian TV to American Idol|author=Kerri Mason|date=18 May 2011}}</ref>

The group was initially named "I Tre Tenorini", but their name was later changed to "The Tryo".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.famigliacristiana.it/articolo/tre-tenorini-senza-paura-di-volare.aspx|work=[[Famiglia Cristiana]]|language=it|title=Tre tenorini senza paura di volare|author=Giulia Cerqueti|date=11 December 2013|archive-date=21 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221145124/http://www.famigliacristiana.it/articolo/tre-tenorini-senza-paura-di-volare.aspx}}</ref> With this name, in 2010 the group participated in the [[charity record|charity single]] "[[We Are the World 25 for Haiti]]", a remake of the 1985 hit song "[[We Are the World]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wuz.it/articolo-libri/4284/Sanremo-The-TRYO.html|publisher=Wuz.it|language=it|date=17 February 2010|title=Zia Antonella Clerici e i tre piccoli tenori for Haiti|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215221125/http://www.wuz.it/articolo-libri/4284/Sanremo-The-TRYO.html|archive-date=15 February 2015}}</ref>
In February of the same year, they also performed the songs "[[Granada (song)|Granada]]" and "Un amore così grande" for [[Queen Rania of Jordan]] during the [[Sanremo Music Festival 2010|60th Sanremo Music Festival]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.corriere.it/spettacoli/speciali/2010/sanremo/notizie/sanremo-ospiti-seconda-serata_3bac0498-1bde-11df-a6d3-00144f02aabe.shtml | publisher = [[Il Corriere della Sera]] | date = 17 February 2010 | title = Serata tra Moulin Rouge, gaffe e regine all'Ariston | language = it | access-date = 28 June 2011}}</ref> In late 2010, their name was finally changed into "Il Volo" (English: ''the flight'')

=== ''Il Volo'' (2010–12) ===
In 2010, Il Volo started working on their first studio album, which was recorded in the [[Abbey Road Studios]] in [[London]] and produced by [[Tony Renis]] and [[Humberto Gatica]].<ref name="MTV">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.it/news/news-detail.asp?idnews=29999|publisher=[[MTV Italy]]|language=it|access-date=21 February 2015|title=Il Volo nei negozi|date=30 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314025740/http://www.mtv.it/news/news-detail.asp?idnews=29999|archive-date=14 March 2012}}</ref>

== Controversy ==
On 29 September 2015, Italian media reported that Il Volo had trashed a room of the Hotel Garni du Lac, in [[Locarno]], where they were staying. Apparently, the managers of the hotel had released some interviews to the German broadcast [[ZDF]] and later to the Italian media ''La Regione'' and ''Liberatv'', complaining about the acts of vandalism the trio had put into place before leaving the premises. Allegedly, they stated that "objects, mattresses and laundry had been haphazardly thrown everywhere", and that "there was urine out of the toilet in the bathroom and the room walls had been smeared with fecal matter". Seemingly, the behaviour was to be explained with a sort of revenge for the room carpeting, which the trio was allergic to. Il Volo's press manager Danilo Ciotti commented the news immediately after stating that "it's true that they don't love carpeting because of allergies, but I don't believe they caused damages intentionally".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ilgiornale.it/news/cronache/feci-sui-muri-e-hotel-distrutto-ora-volo-finisce-nei-guai-1176859.html|title=Feci sui muri e hotel distrutto.

Feci sul muro e materassi gettati alla rinfusa”|language=Italian}}</ref>
Subsequently, [[Barbara d'Urso]] arranged a live meeting during the Italian TV broadcast ''Pomeriggio 5'' between the director of the Hotel du Lac and Il Volo's press managers. The director denied all the statements attributed to him, clearly saying that all the story was fake news, resizing the events to some unmade beds and some depliants fallen from the desk in one of the rooms where the trio was staying.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/cultura/2015/09/29/musica-accuse-vandalismo-contro-il-volo-il-trio-falsita_235cd6be-20f0-4fe9-bd47-d9c82f9aa90d.html|title=Il Volo, anche albergatore ora smentisce accuse di vandalismo|language=Italian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ilmessaggero.it/societa/gossip/il_volo_albergatore_lugano-1273717.html|title=Il Volo, l'albergatore di Lugano smentisce: non hanno imbrattato le camere|language=Italian}}</ref>
