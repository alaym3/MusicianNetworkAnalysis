In 2016, the band officially changed their name from "Andrew Jackson Jihad" to AJJ (a moniker that many of their fanbases had been using to refer to them for several years). In a statement on the band's website, Bonnette wrote "1.) We are not Muslims, and as such, it is disrespectful and irresponsible for us to use the word [[jihad]] in our band’s name. 2.) We no longer wish to be a living reminder of the president [[Andrew Jackson]]. Interesting historical figure as he was, he was an odious person and our fascination with him has grown stale."<ref>[http://www.andrewjacksonjihad.com/big-news-today/ Statement on the band's website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407055507/http://www.andrewjacksonjihad.com/big-news-today/ |date=April 7, 2016 }} February 24, 2016</ref> On June 28, 2016, AJJ announced their 6th studio album, ''[[The Bible 2]]'', along with a tracklist and pre-order bundles. The band also released a music video for the album's lead single, "Goodbye, Oh Goodbye." The clip is a style parody of the [[viral video]] approach to music videos made by the band [[OK Go]]. On August 1, 2016, the music video for "Junkie Church" was released.

In 2017, the band released an EP on [[Lauren Records]] of new material entitled ''Back in the Jazz Coffin'', consisting of acoustic songs. They also released ''Decade of Regression'', a live album as a Record Store Day exclusive.

In August 2017, after Chris Clavin of Plan-It-X and Ghost Mice was accused of sexual abuse, the band took all of their music off of the label and re-released it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/AJJtheBand/status/900820689992560640/photo/1|title=AJJ on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-08-19|language=en}}</ref>

On October 30, 2019, AJJ announced a new studio album titled ''Good Luck Everybody''. This announcement coincided with the release of "A Poem", the lead single from the album. After three more singles and two music videos, for "Mega Guillotine 2020" and "Loudmouth", ''Good Luck Everybody'' was released on January 17, 2020. Unlike previous releases, ''Good Luck Everybody'' is self-published under a newly formed label entitled "AJJ unlimited LTD".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jenke |first1=Tyler |title=Folk-punk legends AJJ announce new album, 'Good Luck Everybody' |url=https://tonedeaf.thebrag.com/ajj-new-album-good-luck-everybody/ |website=Tone Deaf |access-date=31 October 2019}}</ref>
