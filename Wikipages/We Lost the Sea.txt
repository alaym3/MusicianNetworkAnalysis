'''We Lost the Sea''' are an [[instrumental]] band from [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]. The band was originally formed by friends from multiple bands that had dissolved in 2007 from the outer west Sydney suburb of Campbelltown, NSW. The current line up is composed of Mark Owen, Matt Harvey, Nathaniel D'Ugo, Mathew Kelly, Kieran Elliott and Carl Whitbread.

Their third album ''Departure Songs'' gained them widespread acclaim within the post-rock and metal scenes around the world. The band have reached notable success internationally for their emotional and energetic live performances and modern and thematic approach to the post-rock genre. They are currently released through Australian independent record label Bird's Robe Records, which is distributed through MGM in Australia and independently worldwide. Dunk!Records in Europe and Translation Loss in North America.

== History ==
=== Early years, ''Crimea'' ===
The band was formed when Mark Owen approached Nathaniel D’Ugo to start a band with him after Nathaniel's former band [[Omeratá]] had broken up. From here they called upon friends Chris Torpy on vocals and the twin brothers Grant and Brendon Warner on guitar from another local band Sound The Mute to join. The idea was to create a huge and heavy sounding project that would act like a collaborative of musicians. The band's member line up has changed many times, at one point consisting of nine members. The band's name doesn't have a specific meaning. The early members wanted a name that creates an enigmatic feeling, evokes emotion and leaves interpretation up to the listener. The group often incorporates themes into their albums such as loss, grief and hope, space exploration, war and stories from history. 
 
They released their first record entitled '' Crimea '' - engineered and mixed by [[Magnus Lindberg]] of [[Cult of Luna]] in February 2009 at Sing Sing studios in Melbourne, Australia. This was released only on CD and independently by the band the following year. This record was inspired by poems written about the [[Crimean war]] and famous heroic figures such as [[Florence Nightingale]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.echoesanddust.com/2014/03/we-lost-the-sea-crimea-remastered/|title=We Lost the Sea - Crimea (Remastered)|date=11 March 2014|website=Echoes And Dust|accessdate=13 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/74880/We-Lost-the-Sea-Crimea/|title=We Lost the Sea - Crimea (album review )|website=Sputnikmusic.com|accessdate=13 December 2018}}</ref>

=== ''The Quietest Place on Earth'' ===
In 2010 the band went into the studio to record their second album ''The Quietest Place on Earth''. Complications and member changes delayed the release of this record until 2012 when Grant Warner and Brad Garnam left the band and Matt Harvey (ex Omeratá) joined on guitars after receiving a last minute call from vocalist Chris Torpy, who asked him to come to a rehearsal. A short time after the band joined with Bird's Robe Records.

The record was received well and was followed up with a handful of highly successful local shows including their sold out album launch and supporting American post-metal band Rosetta where the band debuted the new line up and songs. Lochlan Watt from [[Triple J]] and Dave Drayton from [[FBi Radio]] both mentioned the band in the best of 2012 in Drum Media's writers poll.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/spa_magazines/docs/dm_1141/55|title=Drum Media Sydney Issue 1141|website=Issuu|accessdate=13 December 2018}}</ref>

In March 2013, their vocalist, Chris Torpy died by suicide, leaving the band to take a short break. Their first show without Chris took place on March 21, 2013 at the Annandale Hotel, opening for [[This Will Destroy You]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://themusic.com.au/news/all/2013/03/04/sydney-experimental-metal-band-we-lost-the-sea-confirm-singers-passing/|title=/|website=The Music|accessdate=13 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://themusic.com.au/reviews/reviews-live/2013/03/25/this-will-destroy-you-annandale-hotel-andrew-mcdonald/|title=/|website=The Music|accessdate=13 December 2018}}</ref>

On April 26, 2014 We Lost The Sea held a tribute and benefit show to raise awareness and money for suicide prevention and education surrounding depression and anxiety in association with [[beyondblue]] Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artascatharsis.com/tribute-show-for-chris-torpy-of-we-lost-the-sea/|title=Tribute show for Chris Torpy of We Lost The Sea|website=Artascatharsis.com|accessdate=13 December 2018}}</ref>

=== ''Departure Songs'' ===
In 2015 the band recorded and released their third LP ''Departure Songs'' initially through Bird's Robe Records and Art As Catharsis Records in Australia. It was later released in Europe through Dunk!Records and in North America through Translation Loss Records. This record is their first all-instrumental album and was a slight shift away from their old dynamic. Heavily affected by the loss of Chris, ''Departure Songs'' is a concept album inspired by failed, yet epic and honourable individual journeys or events throughout history where people have done extraordinary things for the greater good of those around them, and the progress of the human race itself. Each song has its own story and is a soundtrack to that story with its own piece of art to illustrate the journeys within the songs.

The artwork, made by guitarist Matt Harvey, helped wrap the theme of this record together with the music and found acclaim on its own merit with an article in Digital Arts Magazine (UK) and reaching over 42,000 views on Behance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/news/illustration/matt-harveys-beautifully-sad-artworks-show-noble-failures-sacrifices/|title=These beautifully sad artworks show noble failures and sacrifices|website=Digital Arts|accessdate=13 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.behance.net/gallery/27933607/We-Lost-The-Sea-Departure-Songs-Complete-Artwork/|title=Behance|website=Behance.net|accessdate=13 December 2018}}</ref>

''Departure Songs'' was widely received and reached critical acclaim all over the world in the highly regarded post-rock scene and even breaking out of the boundaries to reach different audiences everywhere. Their song "A Gallant Gentleman", the main single from the album and featuring a Sydney girls school choir, has been featured on video projects, student films, and promotion for media brands and football clubs and most recently featured on the soundtrack for Ricky Gervais' show After Life released on Netflix in 2019. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://tonedeaf.thebrag.com/ricky-gervais-fan-sydney-lost-sea/|title=Ricky Gervais Fan of Sydney We Lost The Sea|date=19 March 2019|website=Tonedeaf|accessdate=13 December 2018}}</ref> The final song on the album, Challenger - Part 1: Flight has been used for interpretative dance routines and over documentaries. One album stream on YouTube had more than 4.6 million views in June 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.echoesanddust.com/2015/07/we-lost-the-sea-departure-songs/|title=We Lost The Sea – Departure Songs|date=22 July 2015|website=Echoes And Dust|accessdate=13 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heavyblogisheavy.com/2015/07/28/we-lost-the-sea-departure-songs/|title=We Lost The Sea – Departure Songs|date=28 July 2015|website=Heavy Blog Is Heavy|accessdate=13 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://arcticdrones.com/reviews/we-lost-the-sea-departure-songs/|title=Review: We Lost the Sea - Departure Songs|first=Robert|last=Westerveld|date=23 August 2015|website=Arctic Drones|accessdate=13 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://canthisevenbecalledmusic.com/we-lost-the-sea-departure-songs/|title=We Lost The Sea - Departure Songs, an Analysis Of|first=Ignacio De|last=Vincenzi|date=4 May 2016|website=Canthisevenbecalledmusic.com|accessdate=13 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://hhhhappy.com/departure-songs-is-a-dense-journey-through-atmospheric-instrumental-terrain/|title=Departure Songs is a dense journey through atmospheric instrumental terrain|date=6 August 2015|website=Hhhhappy.com|accessdate=13 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carltonfc.com.au/video/2015-10-13/bound-by-blue|title=Bound by Blue|accessdate=13 December 2018|website=Carltonfc.com.au}}</ref>

===First Australian headline tour===
The band embarked on a nine date tour of Australia over the course of June and July 2016. The tour finished at a sold-out show at the Oxford Art Factory in Sydney where they played with the VOX youth choir from [[Sydney Philharmonia Choir]].

===The Last Dive Tour===
In January 2017 the band did a 3 date east coast headline run to celebrate the end of the [[#Departure Songs|''Departure Songs'']] album cycle in Australia before heading to Europe. It also signified the last shows guitarist Brendon Warner would play with the band after deciding to leave to focus on studies. The Sydney Morning Herald listed the Sydney show at the Newtown Social Club as top 5 gig of the week next to artists like Nick Cave, PJ Harvey and Refused. Both the Sydney and Melbourne shows sold out.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/top-5-gigs-20170118-gttgbu.html|title=Sydney's top gigs: Nick Cave, Refused, We Lost the Sea, PJ Harvey, Aurora|first=Bronwyn|last=Thompson|date=17 January 2017|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=13 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://themusic.com.au/news/all/2017/01/09/we-lost-the-seas-guitarist-brendon-warner-farewells-the-departure-songs-album-and-band/|title=/|website=The Music|accessdate=13 December 2018}}</ref>

===European Tour 2017===
In May 2017 the band embarked on their first ever overseas tour to Europe with their debut show at the Belgian post-rock festival Dunk! This was followed by 16 shows around the continent playing some shows to sold-out crowds such as A38 in Budapest and WERK-2 in Leipzig and ending with a huge sold-out show in Paris. Carl Whitbread (Lo!, Omeratá) came on board as their touring guitarist for this tour. The tour also included Sydney post-rock/prog bands Meniscus and Dumbsaint.

===TQPOE 5 year anniversary tour===
In December 2017 the group decided to tour in celebration of their second album ''The Quietest Place on Earth''’s fifth anniversary. They felt that it was underrepresented when it was released and Chris had passed away so soon after its official release that there was only a handful of shows played during that time. Joining them to fill in on vocals for this tour was Jarrod Krafczyk ([[The Amenta]], Omeratá) and former guitarist Brendon Warner filled in on third guitar. This tour also included a last minute support addition from [[Rosetta (band)|Rosetta]] who were in Australia touring with [[sleepmakeswaves]] at the time.

This tour is also when the band started working with Australian music booking agents Select Touring.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://themusic.com.au/music/livereviews/2017/12/12/we-lost-the-sea-lansdowne-hotel-brendan-delavere/|title=/|website=The Music|accessdate=13 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.echoesanddust.com/2017/10/matt-harvey-from-we-lost-the-sea/|title=Matt Harvey from We Lost The Sea|date=30 October 2017|website=Echoes And Dust|accessdate=13 December 2018}}</ref>

===China tour 2018===
On 22 March 2018 the band embarked on a 10 show tour of China managed by the touring company New Noise. This was their first tour to Asia and they played in front of their biggest headline crowd to date at Shenzhen B10 Live, concluding with a show at This Town Needs (formerly Hidden Agenda) in Hong Kong. One of the first shows after it re-opened after UK band [[This Town Needs Guns]] had issues with immigration the previous year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/this-town-needs-hidden-agenda-underground-music-venue-to-return/|title=This Town Needs Hidden Agenda: Underground music venue to return - Coconuts Hong Kong|first=|last=CoconutsHongKong|date=24 January 2018|website=Coconuts|accessdate=13 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smartshanghai.com/event/50329/|title=We Lost the Sea China Tour 2018 |website=Smartshanghai.com|accessdate=13 December 2018}}</ref>

==Record releases==
The band have had multiple pressings done of their records. They are known for high quality artwork and multiple colour variations. Most notably is Departure Songs which has been pressed 3 times with a total of 9 colour variations. All current pressings have sold out.

== Musical style and influences ==
The band's sound has changed over the years while the basis and heart of the music has stayed relatively the same. The loss of their vocalist made the band choose to release instrumental music whereas previously the band had been associated with post-metal, doom and sludge metal genres. They have always leaned towards thematic, long, atmospheric and heavy styles of writing and even with vocals there are many instrumental parts throughout their albums. The band has been referred to sounding like and being influenced by [[Godspeed You! Black Emperor]], [[Mogwai (band)|Mogwai]], [[Cult of Luna]], [[Explosions In The Sky]] and [[The Cinematic Orchestra]].
