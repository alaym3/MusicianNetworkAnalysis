Russell helped the blues guitarist [[Freddie King]] revive his career by collaborating on three of King's albums for Shelter Records during the early 1970s. During those same years, Russell profited from what was then called the "country and western" market by recording and performing under the moniker "Hank Wilson",<ref>{{cite web |last=Jurek |first=Thom |title=Best of Hank Wilson – Leon Russell &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/best-of-hank-wilson-mw0000819188 |website=AllMusic |date=June 23, 2009 |access-date=April 1, 2014}}</ref> and was a regular performer at [[Gilley's Club]], a honkytonk in [[Pasadena, Texas]], made famous by the film ''[[Urban Cowboy]]''.<ref>''Billboard'', August 18, 1979, page TO-4</ref>

Russell recorded the song "Get a Line on You" at [[Olympic Studios]] in October 1969, with contributions from Mick Jagger (lead vocal), Ringo Starr (drums), and probably also [[Bill Wyman]] (bass) and [[Mick Taylor]] (guitar). The recording was made during the recording sessions for the album ''Leon Russell'' (released in 1970), for which Starr and Wyman played drums and bass on some tracks, but was not included on the album.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}} It was shelved until 1993, when it was issued as a bonus track on the 24K gold re-release by DCC Compact Classics (DCC Compact Classics GZS 1049).
