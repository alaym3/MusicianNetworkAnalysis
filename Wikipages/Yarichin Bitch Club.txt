==Plot==
Takashi Tōno is a freshman student who is transferred from Tokyo to Morimori Academy, a private [[College-preparatory school|college prep]] boarding high school located deep in the mountains. Soon after arriving, he befriends Kyōsuke Yaguchi, who is a member of the soccer club and invites Tōno to join him in the club. Tōno's lack of interest in sports forces him to enter the quietest club of all: the photography club. However, the photography club is not what it seems, since the members' duties consist of having sex with other students of the school.

==Characters==
;{{Nihongo|Takashi Tōno|遠野 高志|Tōno Takashi}}
:{{voiced by|[[Yūsuke Kobayashi (voice actor)|Yūsuke Kobayashi]]}}
:Tōno was transferred to Morimori Academy from Tokyo due to his father's job. Unfortunately he entered the Yarichin Club believing it was just a normal photography club. He is hopeless at sports (especially ball games) and gets shy around people, and is often shocked by the activities of the Yarichin Club, frequently walking in on them by accident. He develops a crush on Yaguchi, which eventually falters into a regular friendship.
;{{Nihongo|Yū Kashima|加島 優|Kashima Yū}}
:{{voiced by|Daiki Hamano}}
:The second new transfer student to Morimori Academy. Joined the photography club for photos, but it had nothing to do with photography. He is good at studying and grew up in a big family. He likes Tōno and pretends to be in a relationship with him to prevent him from being raped after the monthly sex results, leading to him actually developing a major crush on him.
;{{Nihongo|Kyōsuke Yaguchi|矢口 恭介|Yaguchi Kyōsuke}}
:{{voiced by|[[Ayumu Murase]]}}
:Kashima's cousin and a member of the soccer club. Yaguchi is Tōno's only friend in class, and they strike up an easy friendship, with Tōno soon developing feelings for him. He comes off as cheerful and kind, and is very popular in class, but this is merely a facade; in reality, he is deeply troubled by jealousy from Kashima, who he looks up to as a master, and is actually a very dark and angry person when faced.
;{{Nihongo|Ayato Yuri|百合 絢斗|Yuri Ayato}}
:{{voiced by|[[Takuya Satō (voice actor)|Takuya Satō]]}}
:A second year student. He is a versatile, meaning he can be either a top or a bottom, and behaves very oddly, speaking in broken sentences and slurred words and frequently making random noises. Despite this, he is one of the smartest students in the entire school, and takes extra classes and tests.
;{{Nihongo|Yui Tamura|田村 唯|Tamura Yui}}
:{{voiced by|[[Kazuyuki Okitsu]] (BLCD)}}
:{{voiced by|[[Yūki Ono]] (OVA)}}
:A second year student who has an unrequited love towards Yaguchi. He has a great sense of loyalty and likes to do disgusting things to people. He can't express his thoughts very well, and usually ends up saying the complete opposite of what he intends.
;{{Nihongo|Keiichi Akemi|明美 圭一|Akemi Keiichi}}
:{{voiced by|[[Tsubasa Yonaga]]}}
:President of the Yarichin Club and Itome's boyfriend. Enrolled in Morimori Academy since middle school, he is half Japanese and half English. His full name is Keiichi Claude Akemi.
;{{Nihongo|Kōshirō Itome|糸目 幸士郎|Itome Kōshirō}}
:{{voiced by|Masahiro Yamanaka}}
:Akemi's boyfriend, a silent member of Yarichin Club with a romantic personality. Usually a top, but is a bottom when having sex with Akemi. Itome is deeply in love with Akemi and hails from a rich family.
;{{Nihongo|Itsuki Shikatani|鹿谷 樹|Shikatani Itsuki}}
:{{voiced by|[[Masatomo Nakazawa]]}}
:A clean freak with a persecution complex, and a hypochondriac towards most things except sex. Likes wearing women's clothing. He is a bottom and frequently suffers at the hands of Matsumura, a teacher, who blackmails him into having sex with him.
;{{Nihongo|Tōru Fujisaki|藤咲 透|Fujisaki Tōru}}
:{{voiced by|[[Kentarō Kumagai]]}}
:A first year student who becomes obsessed with Yuri after he saved his life when he tried to commit suicide by jumping from the roof of the school.
;{{Nihongo|Matsumura|松村}}
:{{voiced by|[[Daisuke Ono]]}}
