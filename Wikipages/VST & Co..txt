'''VST & Company''', or simply '''VST''', is a Filipino [[disco]] group from Manila, Philippines, formed in 1977. Hailed as one of the most successful Filipino bands of the late 1970s, the group is considered by many to be one of the original proponents of [[Original Pilipino Music|OPM (Original Pilipino Music)]]. Succeeding the [[Manila sound]] genre early in the decade as pioneered by the bands [[Hotdog (band)|Hotdog]] and [[Cinderella (Filipino band)|Cinderella]], the group rose to fame with their first hit song, "[[Awitin Mo at Isasayaw Ko]]". The song ignited Philippine disco culture, and sparked “VST Mania”; a craze that swept across the country throughout the late 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/01/18/20/awitin-mo-at-isasayaw-ko-turns-40-and-vst-co-are-holding-a-concert|title= 'Awitin Mo at Isasayaw Ko' turns 40 and VST & Co. are holding a concert|first=Leah|last=Salterio|work=ABS-CBN News}}</ref> With five best-selling long playing albums which host a catalogue of hits such as "[[Rock Baby Rock]]", “Swing It Baby”, “Disco Fever”, "[[Magsayawan]]", “Kiss, Kiss”, “Magnifica”, and “Step No, Step Yes”; three critically acclaimed full-length films: ''Disco Fever'' (1978), ''Swing It… Baby'' (1979), and ''Rock Baby, Rock'' (1979), hallmark the band's cultural influence and historical contributions to contemporary [[Pinoy pop|Philippine pop music]].

==History==
VST & Company was conceptualized by comedian [[Tito Sotto]], then vice president at [[Vicor Music Corporation]], in response to the success of the song "Dahil Mahal Kita" by the [[Boyfriends (Filipino band)|Boyfriends]]. In a 2011 interview with [[Arnold Clavio]], Sotto tells the story of hearing the Boyfriends tune being sung by a waitress, which gave him the impetus to create a better hit:<ref name="Arnold Clavio Show">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqJnfh_QCHE&t=108 Tito Sotto Interview on Arnold Clavio Show]</ref>
{{quote| Nung araw, nung ako'y vice president ng Vicor, lahat ng hit galing sa amin. Eh, may kayabangan ako. Ayaw ko nanggagaling ang hit sa ibang kompanya. Itong [[PolyEast Records|Octo]] (Arts) naka-tsamba, itong Boyfriends maghi-hit yung "Dahil Mahal Kita"... kinakanta nung ano... nung waitress! Ano bang kinakanta mo riyan? Maganda eh, sabi ko... kinabahan ako, mag hi-hit ito. Gumawa din kami! Gumawa ako. Ginawa ko, mas-class. May orkestra, tapos disco ang tira. Diba, "Awitin Mo At Isasayaw Ko", tapos yung flip-side nun eh, "Ikaw Ang Aking Mahal"? Yung pag-labas nun, naging monster hit.

[Back in the day, when I was vice president of Vicor, all the hits came from us. I had a bit of cockiness. I didn't want hits coming from another company. Octo (Arts) got lucky, "Dahil Mahal Kita" of the Boyfriends just made the waves... A waitress was singing it! 'Why are you singing that?' 'It was beautiful,' she said... I got nervous that this was already a hit; soon to be even more. I had to make something! I made something. What I made, had more class. There was an orchestra, and the style of execution was disco. "Awitin Mo at Isasayaw Ko", and its flip-side was, "Ikaw ang Aking Mahal", right? When that was released, it became a monster hit.]<ref name="Arnold Clavio Show">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqJnfh_QCHE&t=108 Tito Sotto Interview on Arnold Clavio Show]</ref>

In a mini documentary special by ''[[ASAP (TV program)|ASAP]]'', featuring artists that gave birth to the [[Manila sound]] movement, which then led to the beginnings of [[Original Pilipino Music|OPM (Original Pilipino Music)]], Male Rigor confirms Tito Sotto's anecdotal account:<ref name="ASAP">[https://youtube.com/watch?v=HcZ2CXVgoRc?t=427 ASAPinoy features the music of Manila sound]</ref>

{{quote| Tito Sotto worked for Vicor. There was one time, nandun siya sa [he was there at] Vicor... he had lunch sa [at the] canteen. Tinanong niya yung waitress [he asked the waitress], "anong kinakanta mo?" ["what are you singing?"]. Sabi ng waitress (the waitress said), "Sir! Hindi ninyo alam yan? Yun ang kanta ng Boyfriends!" ["Sir! You don't know this? That's the song of the Boyfriends!"] And he knew it came from OctoArts. So Tito thought, kailangan may panagot doon sa Boyfriends [there must be a counter response to the Boyfriends].<ref name="ASAP">[https://youtube.com/watch?v=HcZ2CXVgoRc?t=427 ASAPinoy features the music of Manila sound]</ref>

Foreign artists such as the [[Bee Gees]], [[Earth, Wind & Fire]] and [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] influenced the musical style of VST & Company, at a time when disco music dominated the airwaves during the mid-to-late 1970s. The band became a regular performer on the noontime show ''[[Eat Bulaga!]]'', hosted by the Sotto brothers (Tito, Vic) and Joey de Leon. The band's legacy is an attestment to their enduring popularity, as their hit songs continue to be played on the radio, and used in television and in film. In an interview with [[GMA Network News]] in 2008, songwriter Joey de Leon yearned to write new songs for VST & Co.<ref>[http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/showbiz/content/84826/joey-de-leon-wants-to-write-songs-for-vst-co-anew/story/ Joey de Leon wants to write songs for VST & Co anew GMA News]</ref>

'''"Awitin Mo at Isasayaw Ko" (1978)'''<br/>
VST & Company's first major hit, and most recognizable disco anthem, “[[Awitin Mo at Isasayaw Ko]]" ("''Sing and I Will Dance''"), was not originally intended to be the group's first single. Composed by Vic Sotto and Joey de Leon, the song was actually the B-side to the ballad, "[[Ikaw ang Aking Mahal]]" ("''You Are My Love''").<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/01/18/20/awitin-mo-at-isasayaw-ko-turns-40-and-vst-co-are-holding-a-concert|title= 'Awitin Mo at Isasayaw Ko' turns 40 and VST & Co. are holding a concert|first=Leah|last=Salterio|work=ABS-CBN News}}</ref> Original song arranger, Lorrie Ilustre recalls its genesis:

{{quote| As I was leaving Cinema Audio recording studios in Mandaluyong after a session, I got a call from Tito Sotto... He (Tito) asked me to come up with a recording ASAP, as our rival (another recording company) was planning to produce a new single and we had to get ahead of their release. My only direction from Tito was to create something different from what was currently on the airwaves. I had to go back to the studio that very moment. Vic Sotto with his acoustic guitar and Joey de Leon with a pencil and a yellow pad paper, were there trying to put a song together. As Joey (de Leon) was writing the lyrics, Vic (Sotto) would be figuring out the melody.

After a day, back at the studio, I called Jun Regalado (drums), Roger Herrera Jr. (bass) and Celso Llarina (guitar). I just laid down the basic rhythm track as I had to fly to Davao to do a couple of shows for The Jem Fever Tour. I wrote the orchestrations at the Hijo Plantation (now I think is a resort) in [[Tagum]], [[Davao del Norte]] where we stayed. I flew back to Manila with the horn section and from the airport, went straight to the recording studio and dubbed the horns. I had Mang Nardy Manalastas contract the string section and recorded them as well. Vocals were done and right after mixing, "Awitin Mo at Isasayaw Ko" went straight to the pressing plant.

I already had one other song previously arranged and recorded, "Ikaw ang Aking Mahal", a ballad which the record company decided to be the side A of the single which would be promoted and pushed. When the radio stations got hold of the single, the DJs preferred playing the song on side B, which turned out to be "Awitin Mo at Isasayaw Ko". This hit song started the group VST & Company and the rest is history.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/01/18/20/awitin-mo-at-isasayaw-ko-turns-40-and-vst-co-are-holding-a-concert|title= 'Awitin Mo at Isasayaw Ko' turns 40 and VST & Co. are holding a concert|first=Leah|last=Salterio|work=ABS-CBN News}}</ref>

'''VST Mania (1978-1982)'''<br/>
Upon the release of their debut album entitled "VST & Company ([[VST (album)|VST]])", in 1978, it didn't take long for the record to be certified gold. The album ignited Philippine disco culture which led to “VST Mania”: a phenomenal craze that quickly swept across the Philippines, turning the group into overnight celebrities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/01/18/20/awitin-mo-at-isasayaw-ko-turns-40-and-vst-co-are-holding-a-concert|title= 'Awitin Mo at Isasayaw Ko' turns 40 and VST & Co. are holding a concert|first=Leah|last=Salterio|work=ABS-CBN News}}</ref> Roger Rigor comments on the ups and downs of fame:

{{quote| What we thought as first as a quick stint in recording turned out to be life-changing. It is important to note here that VST was already a [[barkada]] to start with. The popularity of the songs in the ‘70s exposed the guys to the rollercoaster demands of being pop idols.

In a span of three years, everything VST and its music were on top of the music scene, with the attention among the youth greatly unexpected. We realized being ordinary guys, like walking to [[Greenhills (mall)|Greenhills]] or enjoying time out for a movie, was not something we could do anymore.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/01/18/20/awitin-mo-at-isasayaw-ko-turns-40-and-vst-co-are-holding-a-concert|title= 'Awitin Mo at Isasayaw Ko' turns 40 and VST & Co. are holding a concert|first=Leah|last=Salterio|work=ABS-CBN News}}</ref>
}}

The public's overwhelming response to VST's first album heralded the band's popular appeal and star potential.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/01/18/20/awitin-mo-at-isasayaw-ko-turns-40-and-vst-co-are-holding-a-concert|title= 'Awitin Mo at Isasayaw Ko' turns 40 and VST & Co. are holding a concert|first=Leah|last=Salterio|work=ABS-CBN News}}</ref> Roger Rigor recalls:

{{quote| In those days, you couldn’t go to a store and buy band merchandise. We would be greeted by fans in our concerts and they would be wearing VST t-shirts that they customized themselves. That was something that always delighted us. The love and dedication we get from our fans, to this day, are awe-inspiring.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/01/18/20/awitin-mo-at-isasayaw-ko-turns-40-and-vst-co-are-holding-a-concert|title= 'Awitin Mo at Isasayaw Ko' turns 40 and VST & Co. are holding a concert|first=Leah|last=Salterio|work=ABS-CBN News}}</ref>
}}

Their first major concert at [[Cebu Coliseum]] in [[Cebu City]], was themed “Galactica”; meant to celebrate the box office popularity of the sci-fi epic, ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars: A New Hope]]''. The band's primary members wore [[Darth Vader]] masks and matching black capes. The aftermath of the highly successful concert reflected band's immediate impact on Philippine pop culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/01/18/20/awitin-mo-at-isasayaw-ko-turns-40-and-vst-co-are-holding-a-concert|title= 'Awitin Mo at Isasayaw Ko' turns 40 and VST & Co. are holding a concert|first=Leah|last=Salterio|work=ABS-CBN News}}</ref>

'''Leaving the spotlight: "Coke Litro" Tour (1982-1983)'''<br/>
As the disco decade came to a close, VST & Company's last performance and public appearance as a band, would be during the nationwide [[Coca-Cola]] "Coke Litro" Tour. The promotional concert tour lasted an entire year, from 1982 to 1983. At the time the band quietly exited the entertainment industry, they had already completed five full-length albums filled with double platinum hits, and made three feature films.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/01/18/20/awitin-mo-at-isasayaw-ko-turns-40-and-vst-co-are-holding-a-concert|title= 'Awitin Mo at Isasayaw Ko' turns 40 and VST & Co. are holding a concert|first=Leah|last=Salterio|work=ABS-CBN News}}</ref>

'''The true meaning of "VST"'''<br/>
Speculation on the true meaning of the group's name has been debated for many decades. In early interviews by local magazines and newspapers, the group playfully suggested it to be: "Very, Secret, Talaga" ["Truly, Very, Secret"]. Although in recent years, it has been revealed that the acronym is simply the initialism of the first names of the group's three founding members: Vic (Sotto), Spanky (Rigor), and Tito (Sotto), as reported in a special by [[People's Television Network|PTV]] evening show ''XIAOTIME'' in 2016, hosted by [[Xiao Chua]], entitled: "VST & Co.: Kultura na Nagbubuklod sa Nasyong Pilipino".<ref name="XIAOTIME">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syIsxei1rnM&t=24 VST & Co.: Kultura na Nagbubuklod sa Nasyong Pilipino]</ref>

During an interview on the [[Arnold Clavio]] Show in 2011, Clavio asks Tito Sotto if "VST" is an initialization of his full name, "Vicente Sotto the Third":<ref name="Arnold Clavio Show">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqJnfh_QCHE&t=108 Tito Sotto Interview on Arnold Clavio Show]</ref>

{{quote| '''Arnold Clavio''': Vicente Sotto the Third. Ikaw yun? [That's you?]
'''Tito Sotto''': Ah, yun ang nakatagong talagang totohanang mga ibig sabihin nun. Although nung araw, sa sales, para ma-palusot ko yun dahil baka mag tampo sa'kin... bat mo... ikaw na lang ang may ari nito... at yung Vicor... Ang sabi ko: Vic, Spanky, Tito yun. [Ah, that's the real hidden meaning behind it. Although back in the day, in sales, so that I'd be able to slide it through as ill feelings may arise towards me... why would you... you're the only one that seems to own this... and with Vicor... I said it was: Vic, Spanky, Tito.]<ref name="Arnold Clavio Show">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqJnfh_QCHE&t=108 Tito Sotto Interview on Arnold Clavio Show]</ref>
}}

During VST's Anaheim concert on January 19, 2020, Roger Rigor jokingly hinted that VST meant, "Very, Secret, Talaga" ["Truly, Very, Secret"], referencing the answer they used to give the press during the band's heyday. Spanky Rigor then clarified that "VST" simply stands for, "Vic, Spanky, Tito":<ref name="VST Live in Concert The National Grove of Anaheim, 2020">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qtwt58BlQvw?t=3478 VST Live in Concert The National Grove of Anaheim, 2020]</ref>

{{quote| '''Roger Rigor''': This is the time that people want to know more about... exactly what VST means. Ah, "Very, Secret, Talaga" ["Truly, Very, Secret"].<br/>
'''Spanky Rigor''': Now you're stil wondering what the VST stands for... we had at least, maybe about two days... thinking about what name to give the band. We decided on VST, which stands for: Vic, Spanky, Tito.<br/> 
'''Roger Rigor''': That's the real story.<br/>
'''Spanky Rigor''': That's the real story. That's the real deal. Kung ano man ang sabihin ng iba [Whatever others may say]... yun po ang ibig sabihin ng VST [that, with respect, is what VST means].<ref name="VST Live in Concert The National Grove of Anaheim, 2020">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qtwt58BlQvw?t=3478 VST Live in Concert The National Grove of Anaheim, 2020]</ref>
