==Band history==
===1968–1981===
YU Grupa was formed in the autumn of 1968 by brothers [[Dragi Jelić|Dragi]] ([[vocals]], [[electric guitar|guitar]]) and [[Žika Jelić]] ([[bass guitar]]), both former members of the band [[Džentlmeni]], Miodrag Okrugić ([[Organ (music)|organ]]) and Velibor Bogdanović ([[drum kit|drums]]). In the beginning the band performed under the name Idejni Posed (''Notional Property''), which was suggested by [[Korni Grupa]] leader [[Kornelije Kovač]].<ref name="Janjatovic241"/> In November 1968, on their concert in Sinagoga club in [[Zemun]], [[disc jockey]] [[Zoran Modli]] asked the audience to suggest a name for the band. The name YU Grupa was suggested by a young man called Miroslav Stanivuk.<ref name="popboks.com"/><ref name="vreme.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=1047499|title=Pola veka u rokenrolu|website=Vreme.com|access-date=28 October 2021}}</ref> In accordance with the name, the band continued to hold birthday concerts on November 29, the date of [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] declaration.<ref name="Janjatovic241"/>

Their first song, "Nona", was recorded at the end of December 1968. The song was inspired by [[folk music]] of [[Kosovo]], and by recording it YU Grupa became one of the pioneers of combining rock and folk music elements on the Yugoslav rock scene.<ref name="Janjatovic241"/> Their first solo concert was organised by radio personality and [[chess master]] [[Nikola Karaklajić]] and journalist [[Peca Popović]], editors of the [[Radio Belgrade]] show ''Veče uz radio'' (''Evening by the Radio''). The concert was held in Dadov Theatre on January 21, 1969.<ref name="Janjatovic241"/> During the year they held a great number of concerts, mostly in Serbia. They recorded fourteen songs for the needs of Radio Belgrade, part of those songs later released on their vinyl singles.<ref name="Janjatovic241"/> All the copies of their first single "Nona" were sold immediately after the release, but the publisher, [[PGP-RTB]], refused to release a new number of copies, so YU Grupa signed a contract with [[Jugoton]]. The band appeared at the Belgrade Spring Festival with the song "Tajna" ("Secret"), a different version of the song performed at the same festival by [[Zdenka Kovačiček]].<ref name="Janjatovic241"/> The songs "Drveni most" ("Wooden Bridge"), "Mali medved" ("Little Bear") and "Devojka Džoj" ("Girl Named Joy") were well accepted on all of their concerts.<ref name="Janjatovic241"/> Okrugić's song "Opus 1" had a significant place on their live appearances, however, it was never recorded by YU Grupa.<ref name="Janjatovic241"/>

The band spent the summer performing at the prestigious club Lanterna in [[Rovinj]].<ref name="Janjatovic241"/> These concerts brought first conflicts inside the band.<ref name="Janjatovic241"/> After they returned to Belgrade, Okrugić left (later forming the band [[Opus (Yugoslav band)|Opus]]) and guitarist [[Bata Kostić|Miodrag "Bata" Kostić]] joined the band.<ref name="Janjatovic242">{{cite book|last=Janjatović|first=Petar|title=EX YU ROCK enciklopedija 1960-2006|year=2007|publisher=self-released|location=Belgrade|page=242}}</ref> Kostić was previously involved in the band's activity, as he was involved in writing of some of the band's songs. Dragi Jelić and Kostić were an effective guitar duo, and Kostić continued to write folk-inspired hits.<ref name="Janjatovic242"/> In March 1970, the band went on [[Bulgaria]]n tour, during which they held forty concerts.<ref name="Janjatovic242"/> Due to the fact that ''Veče uz radio'' show had a [[Cult following|cult]] status in Bulgaria, audience knew all of their songs, but one part of the public was shocked by their appearance.<ref name="Janjatovic242"/><ref name="pressonline.rs"/> After they returned to Yugoslavia, they performed at the rock evening of Belgrade Spring Festival, performing at [[Dom Sindikata]] Hall with [[Korni Grupa]], [[Time (rock band)|Time]] and [[Mladi Levi]].<ref name="Janjatovic242"/>

The band spent the summer of 1972 playing in Rovinj's Lanterna.<ref name="Janjatovic242"/> The concerts in Rovinj were crucial for the band's lineup once again. After returning to Belgrade Kostić and Bogdanović left the band, Kostić joining [[Jutro]], and later forming [[Opus (Yugoslav band)|Opus]] with Okrugić.<ref name="Janjatovic242"/> YU Grupa continued as a trio, with [[Ratislav Đelmaš|Ratislav "Raša" Đelmaš]], a former Mobi Dik, [[Pop Mašina]] and [[Siluete]] member, as the new drummer.<ref name="Janjatovic242"/> They spent the next year playing all across Yugoslavia, gaining new fans in [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]]. At that time, the [[keyboardist]] [[Tihomir Pop Asanović|Tihomir "Pop" Asanović]] was approached to become a new member, but refused, deciding to join [[Novi Fosili]] instead.<ref name="Janjatovic242"/> In February 1971, YU Grupa went to [[London]] to purchase new equipment, and the [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] producers, who earlier had an opportunity to hear their recordings, organized their concert in [[Marquee Club|The Marquee]].<ref name="Janjatovic242"/> Thanks to the concert the band got a term at a studio, recorded demos, and a cooperation with CBS records was planned. The band returned to Yugoslavia to hold a concert at [[Belgrade]]'s Hala sportova, and, holding a high position on [[Yugoslav rock scene]], the band discarded the career in [[England]],<ref name="Janjatovic242"/> also refusing to become the opening band on [[The Allman Brothers Band]] tour.<ref name="vreme.com"/><ref>[http://www.popboks.com/tekst.php?ID=9041 Dejan Cukić - "Dok se još sećam: London", popboks.com]</ref> In the summer of 1973 their [[YU Grupa (1973 album)|debut self-titled album]] was released.<ref name="Janjatovic242"/> The album brought numerous hits: "Trka" ("The Race"), "Čudna šuma" ("Strange Forest"), [[blues]]-oriented "More" ("The Sea"), and their cult ballad "Crni leptir" ("Black Butterfly"), which was sung by Žika Jelić. In November Kostić returned to the band.<ref name="Janjatovic242"/>

At the beginning of 1974, YU Grupa played on [[Srđan Marjanović]]'s debut album ''Srđan Marjanović i prijatelji'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/release/1775425-Srđan-Srđan-Marjanović-I-Prijatelji|title=Srđan – Srđan Marjanović I Prijatelji (1974, Vinyl)|access-date=28 October 2021|website=Discogs.com}}</ref> and later released their second studio album ''[[Kako to da svaki dan?]]'' (''How Come Every Day...?'').<ref name="Janjatovic242"/> The album was musically more diverse, but did not contain the same kind of numerous hits as the previous album. At the end of the year, Dragi Jelić went to serve the army, and until he returned YU Grupa performed as trio. In 1975, Yugoslav guitarists took part in Kongres rock majstora (''Congress of Rock Masters'') concert. The double album ''[[Kongres rock majstora]]'' was released, on which Žika Jelić and Đelmaš were the support band following Bata Kostić, [[Vedran Božić]] and [[Josip Boček]].<ref name="Janjatovic242"/>

Dragi returned in June 1975, and Kostić left the band conventionally. The band negotiated with the keyboard player [[Oliver Mandić]], but the cooperation was not agreed.<ref name="Janjatovic242"/> In 1975, they released ''[[YU Grupa (1975 album)|YU Grupa]]'', featuring hits "Oprosti ljubavi" ("Forgive Me, My Love"), "Novi zvuk" ("New Sound") and "Ja moram dalje" ("I Have to Move On").<ref name="Janjatovic242"/> In September 1976, a compilation album ''[[YU zlato]]'' (''YU Gold''), which featured their songs released on 7" singles, was released.<ref name="Janjatovic242"/> During the same year, Đelmaš left the band and formed [[Zebra (Yugoslav band)|Zebra]]. Dragan Micić replaced Đelmaš, and at the end of 1976, guitarist Nedžat Maculja joined the band. In 1977, they went on the [[USSR|Soviet Union]] tour, during which they held sixty-four concerts. During the same year, they released their fourth studio album ''[[Među zvezdama]]'' (''Among the Stars''). The album featured Bata Kostić as a guest musician.<ref name="Janjatovic242"/> 

In 1978, YU Grupa performed at the [[pop music|pop]]-oriented festival in [[Opatija]], and their song "Spali svoja sećanja" ("Burn Your Memories") was released on the festival album ''Opatija 78''.<ref name="Janjatovic242"/> At the end 1978, Kostić once again became the member of the band, and a former Mama Co Co and Ribeli member [[Dragoljub Đuričić]] (drums) and a former [[Zdravo (band)|Zdravo]] member Dragan Janković (keyboard) joined YU Grupa. This lineup held another [[USSR|Soviet Union]] tour.<ref name="Janjatovic242"/>

The next album ''[[Samo napred...]]'' (''Ride On...''), released in 1979, featured hits "Identitet ("Identity"), "Udaj se dobro" ("Get Married Well"), "Ideš mi na nerve" ("You're Getting on My Nerves"), "Autobus za raj" ("Bus to Heaven"). The album featured [[Bebi Dol]] and [[Slađana Milošević]] on backing vocals as guests.<ref name="Janjatovic242"/> At the time of [[New wave music in Yugoslavia|the great popularity of new wave bands in Yugoslavia]], YU Grupa's popularity, alongside the popularity of other bands with similar stylistic orientation, declined.<ref name="Janjatovic243">{{cite book|last=Janjatović|first=Petar|title=EX YU ROCK enciklopedija 1960-2006|year=2007|publisher=self-released|location=Belgrade|page=243}}</ref> At the end of 1981, their van which included musical equipment, burned down, and Žika Jelić got injured in the fire.<ref name="Janjatovic243"/> After this incident, YU Grupa members decided to end their activity.<ref name="Janjatovic243"/> The Jelić brothers started working as concert organisers, Đuričić became a member of [[Leb i Sol]], and Midorag Kostić became a [[Radio Belgrade]] editor.<ref name="Janjatovic243"/>

===1987–present===
Although they occasionally performed during the 1980s, YU Grupa officially reunited in 1987, in the lineup that featured Jelić brothers, Bata Kostić and Velibor Bogdanović.<ref name="Janjatovic243"/> They released their comeback album ''[[Od zlata jabuka]]'' (''Golden Apple''), with the title track inspired by folk music as the main hit.<ref name="Janjatovic243"/> YU Grupa performed at the Legende YU rocka (''Legends of Yugoslav Rock'') concert, alongside [[Indexi]], [[Drago Mlinarec (musician)|Drago Mlinarec]], [[Korni Grupa]], [[Time (rock band)|Time]] and [[Radomir Mihajlović Točak]].<ref name="Janjatovic243"/> Live versions of YU Grupa's "Čudna šuma", "U tami disko kluba" ("In the Darkness of Discothèque"), "Crni leptir" and a [[Medley (music)|medley]] compiled of "Nona", "Kosovski božuri" ("Kosovo [[Peony|Peonies]]") and "Sama" ("Alone") were released on the double live album ''[[Legende YU Rocka]]''.<ref name="Janjatovic243"/>

This album was followed by ''[[Tragovi]]'' (''Traces''), recorded with Đelmaš on the drums once again, and featuring [[Pera Joe]], [[Saša Lokner]] and [[Nikola Čuturilo]] as guests.<ref name="Janjatovic243"/>
