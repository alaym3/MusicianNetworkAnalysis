On May 18, 2021, Young Nudy released his second studio album, ''[[Dr. Ev4l]]''.

==Legal issues==
On February 3, 2019, while Nudy and his cousin 21 Savage were riding in a car in Atlanta, they were pulled over by police and arrested in an operation targeting Nudy and two other men. Savage was arrested by [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] and charged with being in the [[United States]] illegally from [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. Nudy was charged with aggravated assault and violation of the Georgia Gang Act. Nudy's lawyer stated "We believe that Young Nudy is innocent and this is a case of mistaken identity. Young Nudy's legal team is working closely with law enforcement to ensure this case does not get blown out of proportion." Nudy's attorney stated that the charges stem from a 2017 investigation, which he states Atlanta Police investigated Nudy on and dropped the charges. On February 12, Savage was released on bail, and on February 19, Nudy was granted $100,000 bail, and was released the next day.<ref name="Young Nudy Arrested" /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Burks |first1=Tosten |title=Young Nudy, Rapper Arrested With 21 Savage, Granted Release on Bond |url=https://www.spin.com/2019/02/young-nudy-21-savage-release-bond/ |website=spin.com |date=February 20, 2019 |publisher=Spin |access-date=2 March 2019}}</ref>
