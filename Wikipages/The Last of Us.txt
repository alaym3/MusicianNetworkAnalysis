Players control [[Joel (The Last of Us)|Joel]], a smuggler tasked with escorting a teenage girl, [[Ellie (The Last of Us)|Ellie]], across a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] United States. ''The Last of Us'' is played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]]. Players use firearms and [[improvised weapons]], and can use [[Stealth game|stealth]] to defend against hostile humans and [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] creatures [[Mycosis|infected]] by a mutated fungus in the genus ''[[Cordyceps]]''. In the [[online multiplayer]] mode, up to eight players engage in [[Cooperative video game|cooperative]] and competitive gameplay.

[[Development of The Last of Us|Development of ''The Last of Us'']] began in 2009, soon after the release of Naughty Dog's previous game, ''[[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]]''. For the first time in the company's history, Naughty Dog split into two teams; while one team developed ''[[Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception]]'', the other half developed ''The Last of Us''. The relationship between Joel and Ellie became the focus, with all other elements developed around it. Actors [[Troy Baker]] and [[Ashley Johnson (actress)|Ashley Johnson]] portrayed Joel and Ellie, respectively, through [[Voice acting|voice]] and [[motion capture]], and assisted creative director [[Neil Druckmann]] with the development of the characters and story. The [[Music of The Last of Us|original score]] was composed and performed by [[Gustavo Santaolalla]].

Following its announcement in December 2011, ''The Last of Us'' was widely anticipated. It was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] in June 2013; a remastered version was released for the [[PlayStation 4]] in July 2014.{{efn|name=Remastered}} It received critical acclaim, with praise going to narrative, gameplay, visuals, sound design, [[characterization]], and depiction of female characters. ''The Last of Us'' became one of the [[best-selling video games]], selling over 1.3 million units in its first week and 17 million by April 2018. The game [[List of accolades received by The Last of Us|won year-end accolades]], including multiple [[List of Game of the Year awards|Game of the Year]] awards, from several gaming publications, critics, and game award ceremonies. It has been cited as one of the [[greatest video games ever made]].

Naughty Dog released several [[downloadable content]] additions; ''[[The Last of Us: Left Behind]]'' adds a single-player campaign following Ellie and her best friend Riley. ''[[The Last of Us Part II]],'' a sequel, was released in June 2020. [[The Last of Us (TV series)|A television adaptation]] is currently in production by [[HBO]], written by Druckmann and [[Craig Mazin]] and starring [[Pedro Pascal]] as Joel and [[Bella Ramsey]] as Ellie.

== Gameplay ==
''The Last of Us'' is an [[action-adventure game]] played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]].<ref name="Kotaku Review"/> The player traverses [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] environments such as towns, buildings, forests, and sewers to advance the story. The player can use firearms, [[improvised weapons]], and [[Stealth game|stealth]] to defend against hostile humans and [[Zombie (fiction)|cannibalistic]] creatures infected by a mutated strain of the ''[[Cordyceps]]'' fungus. For most of the game, the player takes control of [[Joel (The Last of Us)|Joel]], a man tasked with escorting a young girl, [[Ellie (The Last of Us)|Ellie]], across the United States.<ref name="announcement"/> The player also controls Ellie throughout the game's winter segment,<ref name="Grounded"/> and briefly controls Joel's daughter Sarah in the opening sequence.<ref name="GamesRadar OPM"/>

In combat, the player can use long-range weapons, such as a rifle, a shotgun, and a bow, and short-range weapons such as a handgun and a short-barreled shotgun. The player is able to scavenge limited-use melee weapons, such as pipes and baseball bats, and throw bottles and bricks to distract, stun, or attack enemies.<ref name="Joystick bricks"/> The player can upgrade weapons at workbenches using collected items. Equipment such as [[First aid kit|health kits]], [[shiv (weapon)|shivs]], and [[Molotov cocktail]]s can be found or crafted using collected items. Attributes such as the [[Health (gaming)|health meter]] and crafting speed can be upgraded by collecting pills and medicinal plants. Health can be recharged through the use of health kits.<ref name="Shacknews Crafting"/>

[[File:The Last of Us Listen Mode.jpg|thumb|260px|Listen Mode allows players to discover the position of enemies and characters by displaying their outline through walls, achieved through a heightened sense of hearing and spatial awareness.<ref name="Listen Mode"/>|alt=The player character is crouching, with his companion nearby. Enemies lurk in the distance, with a white outline alerting players of their location.|left]]

Though the player can attack enemies directly, they can also use stealth to attack undetected or sneak by them. "Listen Mode" allows the player to locate enemies through a heightened sense of hearing and spatial awareness, indicated as outlines visible through walls and objects.<ref name="Listen Mode"/> In the dynamic [[cover system]], the player can crouch behind obstacles to gain a [[Positional advantage|tactical advantage]] during combat.<ref name="PCMag Review"/> The game features periods without combat, often involving conversation between the characters.<ref name="PrimaGames Conversations"/> The player can solve simple puzzles, such as using floating pallets to move Ellie, who is unable to swim, across bodies of water, and using ladders or dumpsters to reach higher areas. Story collectibles, such as notes, maps and comics, can be scavenged and viewed in the backpack menu.<ref name="GamesRadar Collectibles"/>

The game features an [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] system by which hostile human enemies react to combat. If enemies discover the player, they may take cover or call for assistance, and can take advantage of the player when they are distracted, out of ammunition, or in a fight. Player companions, such as Ellie, can assist in combat by throwing objects at threats to stun them, announcing the location of unseen enemies, or using a knife and pistol to attack enemies.<ref name="AI"/>

=== Multiplayer ===
The [[online multiplayer]] allows up to eight players to engage in competitive gameplay in recreations of multiple single-player settings. The game features three multiplayer game types: Supply Raid and Survivors are both team [[deathmatch]]es, with the latter excluding the ability to [[Spawning (video gaming)|respawn]];<ref name="Multiplayer"/> Interrogation features teams investigating the location of the enemy team's [[Safe|lockbox]], and the first to capture said lockbox wins.<ref name="IGN Multiplayer"/> In every mode, players select a faction—Hunters (a group of hostile survivors) or Fireflies (a revolutionary militia group)—and keep their clan alive by collecting supplies during matches. Each match is equal to one day; by surviving twelve "weeks", players have completed a journey and can re-select their Faction.<ref name="PSBlog Multiplayer"/> Killing enemies, reviving allies, and crafting items earn the player parts that can be converted to supplies; supplies can also be scavenged from enemies' bodies. Players are able to carry more equipment by earning points as their clan's supplies grow. Players can connect the game to their [[Facebook]] account, which alters clan members' names and faces to match the players' [[Facebook features#Friend|Facebook friends]].<ref name="GameSpot Multiplayer"/> Players have the ability to customize their characters with hats, helmets, masks, and emblems.<ref name="GameSpot Executions"/> The multiplayer servers for the PlayStation 3 version of the game were shut down on September 3, 2019.<ref name="GamesRadar Multiplayer"/>

== Plot ==
{{See also|List of The Last of Us characters}}

In 2013, an outbreak of a mutant ''Cordyceps'' fungus ravages the United States, transforming its human hosts into aggressive creatures known as the Infected. In the suburbs of [[Austin, Texas]], Joel ([[Troy Baker]]) flees the chaos with his brother Tommy ([[Jeffrey Pierce]]) and daughter Sarah ([[Hana Hayes]]). As they flee, Sarah is shot by a soldier and dies in Joel's arms.

Twenty years later, civilization has been decimated by the infection. Survivors live in [[totalitarian]] quarantine zones, independent settlements, and nomadic groups, leaving buildings and houses deserted. Joel works as a smuggler with his partner Tess ([[Annie Wersching]]) in the quarantine zone in the [[North End, Boston|North End]] of [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. They hunt down Robert ([[Robin Atkin Downes]]), a [[black market|black-market]] dealer, to recover a stolen weapons cache. Before Tess kills him, Robert reveals that he traded the cache with the Fireflies, a rebel [[militia]] opposing the quarantine zone authorities.

The leader of the Fireflies, Marlene ([[Merle Dandridge]]), promises to double their cache in return for smuggling a teenage girl, Ellie ([[Ashley Johnson (actress)|Ashley Johnson]]), to Fireflies hiding in the [[Massachusetts State House]] outside the quarantine zone. Joel, Tess, and Ellie sneak out in the night, but after an encounter with a government patrol, they discover Ellie is infected. Symptoms normally occur within two days, but Ellie claims she was infected three weeks earlier and that her immunity may lead to a cure. The trio make their way to their destination through hordes of the infected, but find that the Fireflies there have been killed. Tess reveals she has been bitten by an infected and, believing in Ellie's importance, sacrifices herself against pursuing soldiers so Joel and Ellie can escape. Joel decides to find Tommy, a former Firefly, in the hope that he can locate the remaining Fireflies.

With the help of Bill ([[W. Earl Brown]]), a smuggler and survivalist who owes Joel a favor, they acquire a working vehicle from Bill's neighborhood. Driving into [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], Joel and Ellie are ambushed by bandits, and their car is wrecked. They ally with two brothers, Henry ([[Brandon Scott (actor)|Brandon Scott]]) and Sam ([[Nadji Jeter]]). After they escape the city, Sam is bitten but hides it from the group. As his infection takes hold, Sam attacks Ellie, but Henry shoots him dead before taking his own life. In the fall, Joel and Ellie finally find Tommy in [[Jackson, Wyoming]], where he has assembled a fortified settlement near a [[hydroelectric]] dam with his wife Maria ([[Ashley Scott]]). Joel decides to leave Ellie with Tommy, but after she confronts him about Sarah, he lets her stay with him. Tommy directs them to a Fireflies enclave at the University of Eastern Colorado. They find the university abandoned, but learn that the Fireflies have moved to a hospital in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]. The two are attacked by bandits, and Joel is severely wounded while escaping.

During the winter, Ellie and Joel shelter in the mountains. Joel is on the brink of death and relies on Ellie to care for him. Hunting for food, Ellie encounters David ([[Nolan North]]) and James ([[Reuben Langdon]]), scavengers willing to trade medicine for food. David turns hostile after revealing the university bandits were part of his group. Ellie manages to lead David's group away from Joel, but is captured; David intends to recruit her into his cannibal group. Refusing, she escapes after killing James, but David corners her in a burning restaurant. Meanwhile, Joel recovers from his wounds and sets out to find Ellie. He reaches her just as she kills David with a machete, an act that traumatizes her, and Joel comforts her before they flee.

In the spring, Joel and Ellie arrive in Salt Lake City. Ellie is rendered unconscious after almost drowning before they are captured by a Firefly patrol. In the hospital, Marlene tells Joel that Ellie is being prepared for surgery: in hope of producing a vaccine for the infection, the Fireflies must remove the infected portion of Ellie's brain, which will kill her. Unwilling to let Ellie die, Joel battles his way to the operating room, kills the lead surgeon, and carries the unconscious Ellie to the parking garage. He is confronted by Marlene, whom he shoots and kills to prevent the Fireflies from pursuing them. On the drive out of the city, when Ellie wakes up, Joel claims that the Fireflies had found many other immune people, but were unable to create a cure and that they have stopped trying. On the outskirts of Tommy's settlement, Ellie expresses her [[survivor guilt]]. At her insistence, Joel swears his story about the Fireflies is true.<ref>{{cite video game |title=The Last of Us |developer=[[Naughty Dog]] |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |date=June 14, 2013 |platform=[[PlayStation 3]] |version=1.0 }}</ref>

[[Naughty Dog]] began [[Development of The Last of Us|developing ''The Last of Us'']] in 2009, following the release of ''[[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]]''.

While at university, Druckmann had an idea to merge the gameplay of ''[[Ico]]'' (2001) in a story set during a zombie apocalypse, like that of [[George A. Romero]]'s ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968), with a lead character similar to [[John Hartigan]] from ''[[Sin City]]'' (1991–2000). The lead character, a police officer, would be tasked with protecting a young girl; however, due to the lead character's heart condition, players would often assume control of the young girl, reversing the roles. Druckmann later developed it when creating the story of ''The Last of Us''.<ref name="failure">{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/19/4744008/making-the-last-of-us-ps3 |title=The power of failure: making 'The Last of Us' |last=Webster |first=Andrew |work=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=September 19, 2013 |access-date=October 20, 2014 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6TSrbm9qe?url=http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/19/4744008/making-the-last-of-us-ps3 |archive-date=October 20, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Druckmann views ''The Last of Us'' as a coming of age story, in which Ellie adapts to survival after spending time with Joel, as well as an exploration of how willing a father is to save his child.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/08/06/the-last-of-us-creators-inspirations/ |title=What inspired The Last of Us (interview) |last=Takahashi |first=Dean |work=GamesBeat |publisher=[[VentureBeat]] |date=August 6, 2013 |access-date=October 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6cNGcaLsV?url=http://venturebeat.com/2013/08/06/the-last-of-us-creators-inspirations/ |archive-date=October 18, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The 20-minute film was intended to "serve as a strong bridge" between the game and its sequel and would "reinterpret each of the chapters of the game with a unique visual treatment", but was canceled by Sony.<ref name="GamesRadar Animated"/>

=== Television series ===
{{main|The Last of Us (TV series)}}
In March 2020, a television adaptation of the game was announced in the planning stages at [[HBO]];<ref name="Variety Development"/> it was formally [[greenlit]] in November 2020.<ref name="Deadline Order"/> Druckmann and [[Craig Mazin]] will write and executive produce the series.<ref name="Variety Development"/> Additional executive producers include television producers [[Carolyn Strauss]] and Rose Lam, Naughty Dog president [[Evan Wells]], [[PlayStation Productions]]'s Asad Qizilbash and Carter Swan, and director [[Johan Renck]].<ref name="Variety Luna"/> [[Kantemir Balagov]] will direct the [[pilot episode]],<ref name="THR Balagov"/> with [[Ali Abbasi (director)|Ali Abbasi]] and [[Jasmila Žbanić]] set to direct later episodes.<ref name="Deadline Directors"/> The show is a joint production between [[Sony Pictures Television]], PlayStation Productions, Naughty Dog, The Mighty Mint, and Word Games; it is the first show produced by PlayStation Productions.<ref name="Variety Development"/><ref name="THR Development"/> Santaolalla will compose the score.<ref name="Collider Santaolalla"/> The show will star [[Pedro Pascal]] and [[Bella Ramsey]] as Joel and Ellie, respectively.<ref name="Deadline Pascal"/><ref name="THR Ramsey"/> [[Gabriel Luna]] will play Tommy,<ref name="Variety Luna"/> Merle Dandridge will reprise her role as Marlene,<ref name="THR Dandridge"/> and [[Nico Parker]] will play Sarah.<ref name="Variety Parker"/> Druckmann noted that some of the show's scripts borrow dialogue directly from the game, while others deviate more significantly; some of the game's action-heavy [[Tutorial (video games)|tutorial]] sequences will be changed to focus more on the show's character drama, at the request of HBO.<ref name="IGN SXSW"/> Filming for the series began in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]] in July 2021 and is expected to end in June 2022.<ref name="CBC Calgary"/>

== Sequel ==
{{main|The Last of Us Part II}}
