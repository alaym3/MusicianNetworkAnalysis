AllMusic: 2002</ref> Music videos were filmed for the singles "[[Ain't Love Grand (song)|Ain't Love Grand]]" and "[[Lip Gloss and Black]]".

All the way through to like [[Bleeding Through]] and stuff, well I wouldn't say they're an influence I guess because they're kind of new. I would say that most people or bands now have kind of stemmed out from [[Green Day]] and I can say that if it weren't for them, love 'em or hate 'em, a lot of these bands now wouldn't be existing. So I wouldn't say it was mostly musical influence but it got me off my ass and made me want to write ya know?<ref>{{Cite web |title=Atreyu Interview From Ozzfest '04 In Camden, NJ - in Interviews |url=http://www.metalunderground.com/interviews/details.cfm?newsid=9716 |access-date=February 7, 2016 |website=Metalunderground.com}}</ref>}}

In an interview with Rock Sound Magazine, frontman Alex Varkatzas stated {{cquote|This is going to sound a little cocky but I'm a singer in a band. I don't think we fit into any genre. I think we are hard to pin down. When we first started it was a little easier. We were a metallic hardcore band with singing parts. There wasn't any else like that when we were doing it. People get confused and say 'you're a metalcore band', but we invented metalcore. That may sound cocky but I don't care. We pre-date [[Poison the Well (band)|Poison the Well]] and [[Killswitch Engage]] and all those bands. I've been doing this since I was figuratively 12 years old.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Atreyu ATREYU FRONTMAN ALEX VARKATZAS: "WE INVENTED METALCORE.
