|work=Variety |date=2011-05-05 |access-date=2014-07-28}}</ref>

After a period of writer's block, Ahn isolated herself in a remote desert hotel to create new music for the album ''This is Where We Are''.  "I found the whole thing really inspiring, and suddenly, all these songs came pouring out.  I just needed a little isolation and focus, some new sounds to play with, and a carefree, 'this is just an experiment' attitude to begin writing again."<ref name="Philthy" /> ''This Is Where We Are'' was released in Japan on 19 July 2013 and later in Korea and Taiwan and was released in the US on 15 February 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.directcurrentmusic.com/dc-music-news-feed/2013/11/20/priscilla-ahn-plugs-in-for-february-25-this-is-where-we-are.html |title=Priscilla Ahn Plugs In for February 25 'This Is Where We Are' |publisher=Hot Press |date=2013-11-20 |access-date=2013-12-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216013228/http://www.directcurrentmusic.com/dc-music-news-feed/2013/11/20/priscilla-ahn-plugs-in-for-february-25-this-is-where-we-are.html |archive-date=2013-12-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

She also composed and performed music for the nationally successful Ghibli film in 2014: [[When Marnie Was There]] directed by [[Hiromasa Yonebayashi]] including the soundtrack in the credit sequence Fine on the Outside, as well as 9 other songs based on the film which were published in an album When Marnie Was There Song Album - Just Know That I Love You.

Ahn's music is described as grounded in folk, country, and pop.<ref name="letssingit1"/>
Ahn explored [[synthpop|electropop]] music in the album ''[[This Is Where We Are]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Monger|first=Timothy|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/this-is-where-we-are-mw0002612822 |title=Priscilla Ahn ''This Is Where We Are'' |publisher=Allmusic |date=2013-12-05 |access-date=2014-04-29}}</ref> Of the album's stylistic departure, she said, " I like to let things naturally flow out when I’m writing, and be whatever they’ll be. I think the biggest reason why this album ended up sounding so different from my previous two is because I wrote most of these songs on a keyboard, instead of my guitar. I bought a keyboard, learned how to use [[Logic Pro]], and used their basic audio samples as a songwriting tool. It opened up a whole new world to me sonically, and all these new songs just came pouring out."<ref name=":0" />

==Personal life==
Ahn married actor [[Michael Weston]] in May 2010. They have 2 children.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lim|first=Vincent|url=http://www.uschina.usc.edu/w_usci/showarticle.aspx?articleID=16939 |title=On Growing Up: Priscilla Ahn album review |publisher=US-China Today|date=2011-06-28 |access-date=2014-07-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Magazine|first=Audrey|date=2014-03-07|title=VOICES CARRY: Priscilla Ahn|url=https://charactermedia.com/voices-carry-priscilla-ahn/|access-date=2020-08-25|website=Character Media|language=en-US}}</ref>
