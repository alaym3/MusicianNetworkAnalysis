"'''Matador'''" or "'''El matador'''" ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "Killer", it means "bullfighter" in Spain) is a song written by Flavio Cianciarulo, bass player of [[Los Fabulosos Cadillacs]], a rock band from [[Argentina]]. It was first released in their 1993 album ''[[Vasos Vacíos]]'' and it is considered their [[signature song]] since the song topped the charts all across [[Hispanic America]].

Alongside "Mal Bicho", "Manuel Santillan, El León" and "Desapariciones" (a cover of [[Rubén Blades]]' song), "El Matador" is one of the Cadillacs' several thematic songs about the oppression and [[forced disappearance]]s during the years of military dictatorship across the Southern Cone, particularly [[National Reorganization Process|Argentina's last civil-military dictatorship]] (1976-1983). The song narrates the story of a revolutionary (known as "El Matador") who is being hunted down by pro-dictatorship law enforcement agents, and the narrative is told from the revolutionary's POV. The song also references [[Víctor Jara]], a [[Chile]]an folksinger and supporter of the [[Salvador Allende|Allende]] government who was kidnapped, tortured and assassinated shortly after the [[Chilean coup of 1973]] by military officials loyal to the [[dictator]] [[Augusto Pinochet]].
