'''Ivor Novello''' (born '''David Ivor Davies'''; 15 January 1893 – 6 March 1951) was a Welsh composer and actor who became one of the most popular British entertainers of the first half of the 20th century.

He was born into a musical family, and his first successes were as a songwriter. His first big hit was "[[Keep the Home Fires Burning (1914 song)|Keep the Home Fires Burning]]" (1914), which was enormously popular during the First World War. His 1917 show, ''[[Theodore & Co]]'', was a wartime hit. After the war, Novello contributed numbers to several successful [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedies]] and was eventually commissioned to write the scores of complete shows. He wrote his musicals in the style of [[operetta]] and often composed his music to the [[libretto|libretti]] of [[Christopher Hassall]].

In the 1920s, he turned to acting, first in British films and then on stage, with considerable success in both. He starred in two silent films directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]], ''[[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog|The Lodger]]'' and ''[[Downhill (1927 film)|Downhill]]'' (both 1927). On stage, he played the title character in the first London production of ''[[Liliom]]'' (1926). Novello briefly went to [[Hollywood]], but he soon returned to Britain, where he had more successes, especially on stage, appearing in his own lavish West End productions of musicals. The best known of these were ''[[Glamorous Night]]'' (1935) and ''[[The Dancing Years]]'' (1939).

From the 1930s, he often performed with [[Zena Dare]], writing parts for her in his works. He continued to write for film, but he had his biggest late successes with stage musicals: ''[[Perchance to Dream (musical)|Perchance to Dream]]'' (1945), ''[[King's Rhapsody]]'' (1949) and ''[[Gay's the Word (musical)|Gay's the Word]]'' (1951). The [[Ivor Novello Awards]] were named after him in 1955.

In 1914, at the start of the First World War, Novello wrote "[[Keep the Home Fires Burning (1914 song)|Keep the Home Fires Burning]]", a song that expressed the feelings of innumerable families sundered by [[World War I]]. Novello composed the music for the song to a lyric by the American [[Lena Guilbert Ford]], and it became a huge popular success, bringing Novello money and fame at the age of 21.<ref name=Grdn/><ref>''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove Music Online]]'' states that the song dates from 1915, but the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' gives the date as 1914, a fact confirmed by the [[British Library]] [http://catalogue.bl.uk/F/6U6CFV8D8YT61TJ95YFXQS36L1967UNQDCNB164KJNXYL77SCB-02460?func=full-set-set&set_number=030723&set_entry=000011&format=999 catalogue]</ref> In other respects, the war had less impact on Novello than on many young men of his age. He avoided enlistment until June 1916, when he reported to a [[Royal Naval Air Service]] (RNAS) training depot as a probationary flight sub-lieutenant. After Novello twice crashed aeroplanes, Marsh arranged his move to the [[British Admiralty|Admiralty]] office in central London for the rest of the war.<ref name=MP57>MacQueen-Pope, pp. 57–62</ref>

==Composer and actor==
[[File:Bobbie-Andrews-1921.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Robert Andrews (actor)|Bobbie Andrews]] in 1921]]
Novello continued to write songs while serving in the RNAS. He had his first stage success with ''[[Theodore & Co]]'' in 1916, a production by [[George Grossmith Jr.]] and [[Edward Laurillard]] with a score composed by Novello and the young [[Jerome Kern]].<ref>"Theodore & Co", ''[[The Play Pictorial]]'', September 1916, p. 50</ref> In the same year, Novello contributed to [[André Charlot]]'s revue ''See-Saw''.<ref name=dnb/> In 1917 he wrote for another Grossmith and Laurillard production, the [[operetta]] ''[[Arlette (musical)|Arlette]]'', for which he contributed additional numbers to an existing French score by [[Jane Vieu]] and Guy le Feuvre.<ref>Findon, B.W. "'Arlette' – An Operette in Three Acts", ''The Play Pictorial'', November 1917, p. 82</ref> In the same year, Marsh introduced him to the actor [[Robert Andrews (actor)|Bobbie Andrews]], who became Novello's life partner.<ref name=dnb/> Andrews introduced Novello to the young [[Noël Coward]]. Coward, six years Novello's junior, was deeply envious of Novello's effortless glamour.<ref name=Grdn/> He wrote, "I just felt suddenly conscious of the long way I had to go before I could break into the magic atmosphere in which he moved and breathed with such nonchalance".<ref>Hoare (1995), p.55</ref>

In 1918 and after the war, Novello continued to write successfully for musical comedy and revue. The former included ''Who's Hooper?'' (1919), an adaptation of a [[Arthur Wing Pinero|Pinero]] play, with a book by [[Fred Thompson (writer)|Fred Thompson]], lyrics by [[Clifford Grey]], and music by [[Howard Talbot]] and Novello,<ref>Findon, B. W. "Who's Hooper?", ''The Play Pictorial'', July 1919, p. 35</ref> and ''The Golden Moth'' by Thompson and [[P. G. Wodehouse]] (1921), for which Novello provided the entire score.<ref>"The Golden Moth", ''The Times'', 6 October 1921, p. 8</ref> For Charlot, he contributed numbers to the revues ''Tabs'' (1918), ''A to Z'' (1921) and ''Puppets'' (1924). For the second of these, his songs included one of his few well-known comedy numbers, "And Her Mother Came Too", with lyrics by [[Dion Titheradge]], written for [[Jack Buchanan]].<ref name=dnb/>

At the same time as his successes as a composer, Novello was making a career as an actor. With "a classic profile that gained him matinee idol status amongst the film-going public",<ref name=oxpop>[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/search_results?q=Ivor+Novello&search=quick "Ivor Novello"], ''Encyclopedia of Popular Music'', Oxford Music Online, accessed 16 March 2011 {{subscription}}</ref> he was sought out, on the strength of a publicity photograph, by the Swiss film director [[Louis Mercanton]]. Mercanton offered him a silent-film role as the romantic lead in ''The Call of the Blood'' (1920).<ref name=Grdn/> In the same year, he made another film for Mercanton, ''Miarka''.<ref name=dnb/> Novello made his first British film, ''Carnival'', the following year.<ref name=dnb/>

[[File:Nina Vanna and Ivor Novello.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Nina Vanna and Novello in "[[The Man Without Desire]]" (1923)]]
Novello made his stage debut in 1921 in ''Deburau'' by [[Sacha Guitry]],<ref>"The Theatres", ''The Times'', 20 October 1921, p. 8</ref> and, among other stage engagements in the next years, he played Bingley in a charity adaptation of ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''.<ref>"Plays of the Year", ''The Play Pictorial'', October 1922, p. 111</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Looser|first=Devoney|title=The Making of Jane Austen|location=Baltimore, MD|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2017|page=105|isbn=978-1421422824}}</ref> At about this time, Novello had an affair with the writer [[Siegfried Sassoon]]; it was short lived, but in the words of Sassoon's biographer John Stuart Roberts, Novello "was a consummate flirt who collected lovers as he gathered lilacs".<ref>Roberts, p. 195</ref>

In 1923, Novello made his American movie debut in [[D. W. Griffith]]'s ''[[The White Rose (1923 film)|The White Rose]]''. The same year, he starred in "[[The Man Without Desire]]", among other British films.<ref>Duguid, Mark. [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/506532/index.html "''The Man Without Desire'' (1923)"], BFI Screen Online, accessed 14 June 2017.</ref> He next co-wrote, produced and starred in the successful 1924 play ''[[The Rat (play)|The Rat]]''.<ref>It was credited to the pseudonymous David L'Estrange, but was the work of Novello and his friend, the actress [[Constance Collier]]: see ODNB</ref> The play was made into a [[The Rat (1925 film)|film]] in 1925, which was so successful that two sequels followed in 1926 and 1928.<ref name=dnb/> His dramatic roles in the West End included the title character in the first London production of [[Ferenc Molnár]]'s ''[[Liliom]]'' (1926).<ref>"Duke of York's Theatre", ''The Times'', 24 December 1926, p. 8</ref>

Other films in which Novello starred included [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog|The Lodger]]'', where he played the title character, and ''[[Downhill (1927 film)|Downhill]]'' (both in 1927). The British film company [[Gainsborough Pictures]] offered Novello a lucrative contract, which enabled him to buy a country house in [[Littlewick Green]], near [[Maidenhead]].<ref name=dnb/> He renamed the property Redroofs, and he entertained there famously and with little regard for convention. [[Cecil Beaton]], noting the frequent homosexual excesses, coined the phrase, "the Ivor – Noel naughty set".<ref>Hoare (1995), p.123</ref> Coward had by now caught Novello up professionally, despite a joint disaster when Novello starred in Coward's play ''[[Sirocco (play)|Sirocco]]'' in 1927, which was a débâcle, and closed within a month of opening.<ref>Hoare (1995), pp.187–88</ref><ref>"The Theatres. ''Sirocco'' to be Withdrawn", ''The Times'', 12 December 1927, p. 12</ref> In 1928 Novello starred in the silent adaptation of Coward's much more successful ''[[The Vortex]]'', and made his last silent film, ''[[A South Sea Bubble]]''.<ref name=dnb/> During the late 1920s, Novello was the most popular male British film star and was often dubbed as Britain's "handsomest screen actor".<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Davies|editor1-link=John Davies (historian)|editor2-first=Nigel |editor2-last=Jenkins | editor2-link=Nigel Jenkins| editor3-first=Baines|editor3-last=Menna|title=The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales |year=2008 |publisher=University of Wales Press |location=Cardiff|page=626 |isbn=978-0-7083-1953-6|display-editors=etal}}</ref><ref>Macnab, Geoffrey.

Novello returned to composing for the lyric stage in 1929, writing eight numbers for the revue ''The House that Jack Built''. In the same year, he presented his own play ''Symphony in Two Flats'', which he took to New York the following year. It was followed by a successful Broadway production of his ''[[The Truth Game]]'', which brought him to the attention of Hollywood studios. He accepted a contract to write for and appear in [[MGM]] films. He found little to do in Hollywood, however, beyond writing the dialogue for ''[[Tarzan the Ape Man (1932 film)|Tarzan the Ape Man]]''.<ref>According to the ODNB, "he reputedly originated the line that gave rise to the now mythical if inaccurate 'Me Tarzan. You Jane' (originally – with appropriate pointing – 'Tarzan. Jane.')"</ref> Returning to London, he starred in the sound remake of ''[[The Lodger (1932 film)|The Lodger]]'' (1932).<ref name=dnb/>

==1930s musicals==
[[File:Ivor Novello (David Ivor Davies) (1893–1951) (gcf03577).jpg|thumb|Portrait of Novello by Emil Veresmith (oil on canvas, 1924) ([[National Library of Wales]])]]
After beginning the 1930s with a series of non-musical plays: ''I Lived with You'' (1932), ''[[Fresh Fields (play)|Fresh Fields]]'', ''Proscenium'', ''Sunshine Sisters'', ''Flies in the Sun'' (all 1933) and ''Murder in Mayfair'' (1934), Novello returned to composition in 1935 with ''[[Glamorous Night]]'', which was the first of a series of enormously popular musicals.<ref name=Grdn/> ''[[The Times]]'' considered that it was for these that Novello would be popularly remembered.<ref name=times/> Paul Webb, in the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', writes that Novello's show saved the fortunes of the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]]:
{{blockquote|Dominating the British musical theatre from the mid-1930s to the early 1950s, his shows were heavily influenced by the operettas that he had grown up with (he saw ''[[Die lustige Witwe]]'' 27 times), but had a highly individual style of their own. Blending musicals with opera, operetta and both modern and classical dance, these shows were considered something of an anachronism in their own time, but that was part of their appeal.|}}
Another model was Coward's 1929 musical ''[[Bitter Sweet (operetta)|Bitter Sweet]]'', which Novello called "a ''lovely'', lovely thing ... sheer joy from beginning to end". That, too, was an old-fashioned musical, "so full of regret ... for a vanished kindly silly darling age".<ref>Letter from Novello to Coward, undated, in Day, p. 156</ref>

For all his four 1930s musicals, Novello wrote the book and music, [[Christopher Hassall]] wrote the lyrics, and the orchestrations were by Charles Prentice. ''Glamorous Night''  starred Novello and [[Mary Ellis]], with a cast including [[Zena Dare]], [[Olive Gilbert]] and [[Elizabeth Welch]], and ran from 2 May 1935 to 18 July 1936, at Drury Lane and then the [[London Coliseum]].<ref>"Theatres", ''The Times'', 2 May 1935, p. 12; and 18 July 1936, p. 12</ref> ''[[Careless Rapture]]'' ran from 11 September 1936 for 296 performances, with Novello, [[Dorothy Dickson]] and Zena Dare in the leading roles.<ref>"Drury Lane", ''The Times'', 12 September 1936, p. 10; and Gaye, p. 1529</ref> ''[[Crest of the Wave (musical)|Crest of the Wave]]'' starred Novello, Dickson and Gilbert, and ran from 1 September 1937 for 203 performances.<ref name=grove/> The last of Novello's prewar musicals was ''[[The Dancing Years]]'', which starred Novello, Ellis and Gilbert, opened at Drury Lane, closed on the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], and reopened at the [[Adelphi Theatre]], running for a combined total of 696 performances, closing on 8 July 1944.<ref>Gaye, p. 1530</ref> This show was the closest Novello came to fulfilling his mother's early ambitions for him to write operas; he played an Austrian composer-conductor at the [[Vienna State Opera|Wiener Hofoper]].<ref name=grove/>

==Second World War and last years==
Novello presented only two new shows during the Second World War. ''Arc de Triomphe'' (1943), a musical vehicle for Mary Ellis, was only a modest success, but ''[[Perchance to Dream (musical)|Perchance to Dream]]'' (1945) was immensely successful, running for 1,022 performances. In between the two shows, Novello had been in serious legal trouble and served four weeks in prison for misuse of [[Gasoline|petrol]] coupons, a serious offence under [[Rationing in the United Kingdom#World War II|rationing laws]] in wartime Britain. An admiring fan had stolen the coupons from her employer, but the court found that Novello was also culpable.<ref>MacQueen-Pope, p. 234. The offending fan, Dora Grace Constable, escaped with a £50 fine: see ODNB</ref> The prison term, though short, came as a severe shock to Novello, both mentally and physically, and had serious lasting effects.<ref name=dnb/> Not everybody was supportive; Coward's sympathy was limited: "He's been fighting like a steer to keep going as before the war and hasn't done a thing for the general effort",<ref>Hoare (1995), p.349; Coward's modified sympathy was later echoed in [[Ewan MacColl]]'s song "Ivor": see MacColl, Ewan. ''Bad Lads and Hard Cases'', Riverside LP 1957</ref> but when Novello returned to ''The Dancing Years'' after his release, he received "a rapturous ovation" on his first entrance.<ref name=dnb/>

Novello's last full-scale production in this style, ''[[King's Rhapsody]]'' (1949), was, in Webb's words, "a selfconsciously romantic counter-blast to the modern musical: crown princes, ballrooms, royal yachts, beautiful princesses and a full-scale coronation".<ref name=grove/> After the rigours of war, this escapist entertainment had strong box-office appeal, and ran for 841 performances.<ref>Gaye, p. 1533</ref> The show starred Novello, and the cast included [[Phyllis Dare]], Zena Dare, Olive Gilbert and Bobbie Andrews. It was still running, at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]], when Novello's last show opened. This was ''[[Gay's the Word (musical)|Gay's the Word]]'' (1951). Novello had written no role for himself; the show starred the comedy actress [[Cicely Courtneidge]] and was a departure from his established pattern, balancing the contrasting styles of European operetta and post-war American musicals.<ref name=dnb/> ''The Times'' commented that the show "cheerfully parodied the very [[Ruritania]]n romances to which he owed his most triumphant successes".<ref name=times/>

Only a few weeks before Novello's death, Coward had written of him: "Theatre – good, bad and indifferent – is the love of his life. For him, other human endeavours are mere shadows. ... The reward of his work lies in the indisputable fact that whenever and wherever he appears the vast majority of the British public flock to see him."<ref name=tls>[[Trewin, J. C.]] "Popular Idol", ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', 18 May 1951, p. 304</ref> ''The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'' writes of Novello that he was "until the advent of [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], the 20th-century's most consistently successful composer of British musicals".<ref name=grove/>

The [[Ivor Novello Awards]] for songwriting, established in 1955 in Novello's memory, are awarded each year by [[The Ivors Academy]] (formerly the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA)) to British songwriters and composers as well as to an outstanding international music writer.<ref>Pegler, Martin. ''Soldiers' Songs and Slang of the Great War'', Osprey Publishing, 2014, p. 248 {{ISBN|9781427804150}}</ref> A scholarship in memory of Novello was established at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]], and in 1952 a bronze bust of him by [[Clemence Dane]] was unveiled at Drury Lane. In [[St. Paul's, Covent Garden]], known as the actors' church, a panel was installed to commemorate Novello, and in 1972, to mark the 21st anniversary of his death, a memorial stone was unveiled in [[St. Paul's Cathedral]].<ref name=dnb/>

In 1993, the centenary of Novello's birth was marked by several celebratory shows around the UK, including one at the [[Players Theatre]] in London.<ref name=oxpop/> In 2005, the [[Novello Theatre|Strand Theatre]], above which Novello lived for many years, was renamed the Novello Theatre, with a plaque in his honour set at the entrance.<ref>[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1922138 "Ivor Novello plaque, Aldwych"], Geograph.org, accessed 26 September 2014.</ref> On 27 June 2009, a statue of Novello was unveiled outside the [[Wales Millennium Centre]] in [[Cardiff Bay]].

Novello was portrayed in [[Robert Altman]]'s 2001 film ''[[Gosford Park]]'' by [[Jeremy Northam]], and several of his songs were used for the film's soundtrack, including "Waltz of My Heart", "And Her Mother Came Too", "I Can Give You the Starlight", "What a Duke Should Be", "Why Isn't It You?" and "The Land of Might-Have-Been".

==Songs==
[[File:Cloth, souvenir (AM 783288-1).jpg|thumb|Silk handkerchief with manuscript for "[[Keep the Home Fires Burning (Ivor Novello song)|Keep The Home Fires Burning]]" ]]
Among Novello's well-known songs are "[[Keep the Home Fires Burning (1914 song)|Keep the Home Fires Burning]]",<ref>[http://www.firstworldwar.com/audio/keepthehomefiresburning.htm 1917 mp3 recording of "Keep the home fires burning"] sung by [[John McCormack (tenor)|John McCormack]], firstworldwar.com, accessed 20 November 2009.</ref> "Fold Your Wings", "Shine Through My Dreams", "[[Rose of England]]", "I Can Give You the Starlight", "And Her Mother Came Too", "My Dearest Dear", "The Land of Might-Have-Been", "When I Curtsied to the King", "[[We'll Gather Lilacs]]",<ref name=Grdn/> "Someday My Heart Will Awake", "Yesterday", "Waltz of My Heart", "Why Isn't It You", "My Life Belongs to You", "Fly Home Little Heart", "Take Your Girl" and "Primrose".

In ''Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', Webb writes that although Novello's oeuvre is generally thought of as "romantic" and "[[Ruritanian]]", his music "was far more varied than his current reputation suggests". Webb contends that such romantic hits as "Someday My Heart Will Awake" were balanced by "rousing operetta choruses ... and jazz age numbers" while {{"'}}Rose of England' is a stately patriotic piece that stands comparison with [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]] or [[William Walton|Walton]]".<ref name=grove/>
