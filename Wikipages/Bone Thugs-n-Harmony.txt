'''Bone Thugs-N-Harmony''' is an American hip hop group consisting of rappers [[Bizzy Bone]], Wish Bone, [[Layzie Bone]], [[Krayzie Bone]], and [[Flesh-n-Bone]]. The group was signed to [[Ruthless Records]] in late 1993, when they debuted with their EP ''[[Creepin on ah Come Up]]''. The EP included their breakout hit single "[[Thuggish Ruggish Bone]]".

In 1995, the group released its second album ''[[E. 1999 Eternal]]'', which included hits "[[1st of tha Month]]" and "[[East 1999]]". Their hit song "[[Tha Crossroads]]", a tribute to then-recently deceased Eazy-E, won a [[Grammy Award]] in 1997. ''[[The Art of War (Bone Thugs-n-Harmony album)|The Art of War]]'', the group's third album, was released in 1997. Bone Thugs-n-Harmony is the only group that has worked with [[2Pac]], [[the Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Eazy-E]], and [[Big Pun]] while they were all still alive. About.com ranked them {{abbr|No.|Number}} 12 on its list of the 25 Best Rap Groups of All Time,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rap.about.com/od/artist1/tp/BestHipHopGroups.01.htm |title=25 Best Rap Groups of All Time |access-date=July 11, 2012}}</ref> and [[MTV]] called them "the most melodic hip-hop group of all time."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/h/hip_hop_week/2007/groups/index12.jhtml |title=The Greatest Hip Hop Groups of All Time |publisher=MTV.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/695QeAhGI?url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/h/hip_hop_week/2007/groups/index12.jhtml |archive-date=July 11, 2012 |access-date=July 11, 2012 }}</ref>

In 2000, ''[[BTNHResurrection]]'' reached [[platinum disc|platinum]] in one month, while 2002's ''[[Thug World Order]]'' received more moderate sales and promotion, going [[gold disc|gold]] and peaking at {{abbr|No.|Number}} 3 on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart. After that album, the group went on hiatus from their label and released their sixth studio album, ''[[Thug Stories]]'', independently in 2006. In 2007 they had another major-label release, ''[[Strength & Loyalty]]'', on [[Swizz Beatz]]'s label [[Full Surface Records]]. Bone Thugs-N-Harmony "officially" returned with their 2010 album ''[[Uni5: The World's Enemy]]'', released by their own record label, [[BTNH Worldwide]], with distribution by [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]]

Due to conflicts within the group, longtime members Krayzie Bone and Wish Bone officially left the group in April 2011 to work with their independent label The Life Entertainment.<ref name=Krayzievid>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihwQrqU72Vc| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211031/ihwQrqU72Vc| archive-date=2021-10-31 | url-status=live|title=KRAYZIE BONE LEAVES BONE THUGS N HARMONY|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=December 1, 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref name=KillerHipHop>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPT9apmL-e0| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211031/TPT9apmL-e0| archive-date=2021-10-31 | url-status=live|title=Bone Thugs Interview In London (November 2011)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=December 1, 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref name=GlobalGrind>{{cite web |url=http://globalgrind.com/2012/05/16/where-are-they-now-bone-thugs-n-harmony-list/ |title=Where Are They Now?

==History==
===1993: B.O.N.E. Enterprise early years===
Formed in Cleveland, Ohio in 1991,<ref name="officialsite">{{cite web|url=http://www.bonethugsnharmony.com/bio/default.aspx|title=Bone Thugs-N-Harmony Biography|publisher=Bone Thugs-N-Harmony official website|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822005656/http://www.bonethugsnharmony.com/bio/default.aspx|archive-date=August 22, 2008}}</ref><ref name="Lacy">{{cite web|last1=Lacy|first1=Eric|title=Bone Thugs-N-Harmony sends Detroit back in time with legendary lyrical skills at Oakaloosa Festival|url=http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/detroit/index.ssf/2013/07/bone_thugs-n-harmony_wows_detr.html|website=[[Mlive.com]]|access-date=September 22, 2015}}</ref> the group was originally called "Band Aid Boys". They then formed B.O.N.E. Enterpri$e, which consisted of four members—[[Krayzie Bone]], [[Layzie Bone]], [[Bizzy Bone]], and [[Wish Bone]] (all except for [[Flesh-n-Bone]])—and recorded an album titled ''[[Faces of Death (album)|Faces of Death]]'' in the studio of their then-mentor, Kermit Henderson on his indie label Stoney Burke in 1993. Like so many aspiring rappers around the country, they put in calls to executives at record companies, hoping to find someone who would listen. In hopes of securing a record deal, the group was given an audition over the phone, receiving an unfulfilled promise from rapper [[Eazy-E]] to call them back. Determined to reach him, they scrounged together the money for [[intercity bus service|one-way bus tickets]] to Los Angeles. They left for a three-day Greyhound trek and spent four months on the city streets, putting in frequent calls to find him. Nothing came of their search except the news that Eazy-E was, in fact, on his way to Cleveland for a show.

The quartet returned to Ohio, where Diego Blak (born Diego Hodge), a marketer and promoter who had been co-executive producer of ''Faces Of Death'', introduced them to Eazy-E at a concert he promoted in Compton. There, on November 2, 1993, they auditioned for Eazy in his dressing room; Krayzie performed his verse of "Flow Motion" from the ''Faces of Death'' album, and Eazy was impressed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDXJZ7yz9Gc| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211031/bDXJZ7yz9Gc| archive-date=2021-10-31 | url-status=live|title=Krayzie Bone - Audition To Eazy E|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=December 1, 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref> B.O.N.E Enterpri$e then traveled back to Los Angeles after the Cleveland show to seal the deal. At this point, Eazy renamed them Thugs-N-Harmony, but as they wanted to keep the Bone name, they made their name Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. Eazy signed the group (minus Flesh-n-Bone) to his label [[Ruthless Records]].<ref name="officialsite" />

===1994: ''Creepin on ah Come Up''===
Released in June 1994, ''[[Creepin on ah Come Up]]'' was Bone Thugs-N-Harmony's debut with Ruthless. The album's subject matter was focused almost entirely on [[gangsta rap|violent criminal activity]]. Peaking at {{abbr|No.|Number}} 12 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Top 200 Albums]] chart and {{abbr|No.|Number}} 2 on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart,<ref name="Billboard albums">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p44741|pure_url=yes}}|title=Bone Thugs-N-Harmony: Charts & Awards: Billboard Albums|publisher=AllMusic.com|access-date=January 17, 2010}}</ref> it included the hit singles "[[Thuggish Ruggish Bone]]" and "[[Foe tha Love of $]]", the second of which featured a verse by Eazy-E. "Thuggish Ruggish Bone" peaked at {{abbr|No.|Number}} 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and {{abbr|No.|Number}} 2 on the [[Hot Rap Tracks]] chart, and "Foe tha Love of $" peaked at {{abbr|No.|Number}} 39 on the Hot 100 and {{abbr|No.|Number}} 4 on Rap Tracks.<ref name="Billboard singles">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p44741|pure_url=yes}}|title=Bone Thugs-N-Harmony: Charts & Awards: Billboard Singles|publisher=AllMusic.com|access-date=January 17, 2010}}</ref> After a slow start that saw the album's success limited to [[gangsta rap]] audiences, it broke through to the mainstream. The EP marked a major change in style for the group, as they now fully embraced the [[G-funk]] common in [[West Coast hip hop]] of the time. Beats were supplied by [[DJ Yella]], Rhythum D, and Kenny McCloud, and it was the group's first collaboration with newcomer producer [[DJ U-Neek]], who would craft the group's signature sound by producing the majority of their next two albums. For over a year, Eazy-E nurtured their career, continuing to serve as their executive producer and teaching them the business skills he had taught himself over the years. The growing relationship was cut short, however, when Eazy-E died on March 26, 1995, from complications from [[AIDS]]-related pneumonia. Briefly, the young rappers thought they had lost everything with the loss of their friend and mentor. However, the group's potential was apparent, and Ruthless Records continued to support them.

===1995–96: ''E. 1999 Eternal''===
In 1995, the group's second album, ''[[E. 1999 Eternal]]'', was released. It included the singles "[[1st of tha Month]]", which peaked at {{abbr|No.|Number}} 12 on the Hot 100 and {{abbr|No.|Number}} 4 on Hot Rap Tracks, and "[[Tha Crossroads]]", which reached {{abbr|No.|Number}} 1 on both the Hot 100 and Hot Rap Tracks charts. The album generally saw positive reviews from critics as Bone had diversified its content and musical style. Critics were particularly intrigued by the album due to Bone Thugs-N-Harmony's ability to reduce the banality associated with gangsta rap in their music at a time when the subgenre had become exceedingly cliché.<ref>Larkin, Colin. "Bone Thugs-N-Harmony – E. 1999 Eternal." The Encyclopedia of Popular Music. London: Muze, 1998. Print.</ref> A considerable portion of the album's concept was built upon violent subject matter, yet they also incorporated deeper themes, as its songs dealt with more [[spirituality]] and [[occult]] [[mysticism]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rapreviews.com/2009/10/bone-thugs-n-harmony-e-1999-eternal/|title=Bone Thugs-N-Harmony :: E. 1999 Eternal – RapReviews|last=Wallace|first=Emanuel|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref> The album was produced by [[DJ U-Neek]] (with co-production from Tony C. and Kenny McCloud). ''E. 1999 Eternal'' also introduced Bone's trademark tracks devoted entirely to the use of marijuana. The album name originated from one of the street names of a corner (E. 99th street and St. Clair) that was a familiar hangout to Bone members, as well as Eazy-E's album ''[[Eternal E]]''. Naming it after Eazy-E's album was just another way of showing respect and tribute to the rapper who had helped them reach success. Also in 1995, Flesh-n-Bone would become the first member of the group to release a debut album, titled T.H.U.G.S, which was certified [[gold disc|gold]] by the [[RIAA]]. In 1996, due to their success, the Cleveland clan established their own label, [[Mo Thugs Records]], and released the ''[[Family Scriptures]]'' compilation album to introduce many of the Cleveland-based and other artists whom they were developing. ''E. 1999 Eternal'' is the group's most commercially successful album; it has been certified 4x [[platinum disc|platinum]] by the RIAA.

There were plans for Bone Thugs-N-Harmony to collaborate with [[West Coast rap]]per [[2Pac]] on a studio album titled ''One Nation''. The project brought hip hop artists from all areas of the American map such as [[Boot Camp Clik]],<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Meara |first=Paul |url=http://hiphopdx.com/interviews/id.2067/title.black-moon-recall-meeting-tupac-and-creating-the-one-nation-album |title=Black Moon Recall Meeting Tupac And Creating The "One Nation" Album |magazine=HipHopDX |date=April 1, 2013 |access-date=May 24, 2017}}</ref> [[OutKast]], [[Scarface (rapper)|Scarface]], [[E-40]], and more.<ref name=":2">{{cite magazine|url=http://thesource.com/2015/02/06/handwritten-tupac-letter-reveals-one-nation-album-with-outkast-more/ |title=Handwritten Tupac Letter Reveals "One Nation" Album With Outkast & More |magazine=The Source |access-date=May 24, 2017}}</ref> However, 2Pac was shot and killed in September 1996 so the album never came into fruition. Bootlegs of songs produced while 2Pac was still alive have been distributed.

===1997–2001: ''The Art of War'' and ''BTNHResurrection''===
In 1997, the group released the double-disc set ''[[The Art of War (Bone Thugs-n-Harmony album)|The Art of War]]''. Bone explored a variety of subjects and styles, with focus on God and family and an overall ambient, mellow sound. The group incorporated violent lyrics, however, with a large portion of the album dedicated to what they labeled "clones" who claimed Bone had stolen their quick-tongued rapping style and vice versa. The album had been rumored to be titled "DNA Level C" which is Cleveland backwards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thesource.com/2016/07/29/today-in-hip-hop-history-bone-thugs-n-harmony-release-the-art-of-war-20-years-ago/|title=Today in Hip Hop History: Bone Thugs-N-Harmony Release ‘The Art of War’ 20 years ago|website=thesource.com|access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref> The single "[[Look into My Eyes (Bone Thugs-n-Harmony song)|Look into My Eyes]]" appeared on the soundtrack of the film ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]''. It peaked at {{abbr|No.|Number}} 4 on the Hot 100 and {{abbr|No.|Number}} 2 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart.<ref name="Billboard singles"/> "[[If I Could Teach the World]]", the other single from ''The Art of War'', peaked at {{abbr|No.|Number}} 20 on the Hot 100 and {{abbr|No.|Number}} 3 on the Hot Rap Tracks,<ref name="Billboard singles"/> and won an [[American Music Award]]. The album also included "Thug Luv" with [[Tupac Shakur]]. The group's promotional efforts were dampened by the absence of [[Bizzy Bone]] from the album's videos and from large portions of the ensuing tour and other public appearances. This absence eventually fueled rumors of a break-up.

In 2000, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony released ''[[BTNHResurrection]]'', featuring the single "[[Resurrection (Paper, Paper)]]", which peaked on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart at {{abbr|No.|Number}} 52.<ref name="Billboard singles"/> The album's first half featured a slew of hardcore and dark tracks, with the second half being considerably more introspective and soft. Other singles from the album, including "Can't Give it Up", failed to crack the Billboard Hot 100, and the big-budget video for "Change the World" failed to receive any rotation. This was their first group album to prominently feature [[Flesh-n-Bone]], whose presence had been limited on previous releases because he had never signed with the group's label, Ruthless Records. Flesh was convicted for assault with a [[firearm]] and criminal possession of a weapon in June 2000.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1426320/20000616/bone_thugs_n_harmony.jhtml|title=Flesh-N-Bone Convicted On Assault, Weapons Charges|last=Basham|first=David|date=June 16, 2000|publisher=MTV News|access-date=January 17, 2010}}</ref> Pleading guilty, Flesh was sentenced to 11 years in prison.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1426317/20000922/bone_thugs_n_harmony.jhtml|title=UPDATE: Flesh-N-Bone Gets 11 Years In Assault Case|last=Johnson|first=Tina|date=September 22, 2000|publisher=MTV News|access-date=January 17, 2010}}</ref>

The group again began having public disputes with Bizzy Bone. Bizzy Bone abstained from promoting ''BTNHResurrection'' because he felt that Ruthless Records owed him money.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1441984/bizzy-bone-has-a-gift-for-negotiation/|title=Bizzy Bone Has A Gift For Negotiation|last=Baker|first=Soren|date=2001-03-21|website=MTV News|language=en|access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref> He dropped a million-dollar lawsuit he had filed against [[Sony Music]] and [[Loud Records]] in exchange for a termination of his Sony contract.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1441984/20010321/bizzy_bone.jhtml|title=Bizzy Bone Has a Gift for Negotiation|last=Baker|first=Soren|date=March 22, 2001|publisher=MTV News|access-date=January 17, 2010}}</ref> Three members of Bone Thugs-N-Harmony released solo albums in 2001: Bizzy Bone with ''[[The Gift (Bizzy Bone album)|The Gift]]'', Layzie Bone (under the name L-Burna) with ''[[Thug by Nature]]'', and Krayzie Bone with ''[[Thug on da Line]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1441484/20010312/bone_thugs_n_harmony.jhtml|title=Three Bone Thugs-N-Harmony Members Dropping Solo LPs|last=Baker|first=Soren|date=March 13, 2001|publisher=MTV News|access-date=January 17, 2010}}</ref>

===2002–2006: ''Thug World Order'' and ''Thug Stories''===
In 2002, the group released ''[[Thug World Order]]''. This album, comprising what were described “politically slanted” songs, saw a drastic change in subject matter and tone for the group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theseahawk.org/10104/uncategorized/thug-world-order-not-a-comeback-for-bone/|title=“Thug World Order” not a comeback for Bone|last=Alston|first=J. K.|website=The Seahawk|access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref> The lyrics were almost completely void of any violence, while a larger number of tracks focused on the group itself. In contrast, several songs originally intended to be included on the album that were leaked after its release portrayed a much different album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rapreviews.com/2007/11/bone-thugs-n-harmony-t-h-u-g-s/|title=Bone Thugs-N-Harmony :: T.H.U.G.S. – RapReviews|last=Juon|first=Steve 'Flash'|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref> The album debuted at {{abbr|No.|Number}} 12 on the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref name="Billboard albums"/> The first single released from the album was "Money, Money" and the second was "Get Up & Get It", featuring [[3LW]]. The third single, "Home", which featured [[Phil Collins]] performing part of his song "[[Take Me Home (Phil Collins song)|Take Me Home]]", peaked at {{abbr|No.|Number}} 33 on the [[Rhythmic Top 40]], impacting the charts in a number of countries, most notably the United Kingdom.<ref name="Billboard singles"/> Bizzy Bone was expelled from the group in January 2003, leaving only 3 active members: Krayzie Bone, Layzie Bone, and Wish Bone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1459799/20030131/bone_thugs_n_harmony.jhtml|title=Bone Thugs Say Bizzy Is Out For Good This Time|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|date=January 31, 2003|publisher=MTV News|access-date=January 17, 2010}}</ref> ''Thug World Order'' was also Bone Thugs-N-Harmony's final album with Ruthless Records.

''[[Thug Stories]]'', Bone Thugs-N-Harmony's seventh album, was recorded on [[Koch Records]] and released on September 19, 2006. It marked the first time Bone Thugs-n-Harmony had recorded as a trio since they released an internet-only [[extended play|EP]] album called ''Bone 4 Life''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Bone-Life-bone-thugs-harmony/dp/B00186CDSW/ref=sr_1_11?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1453008705&sr=1-11&keywords=bone+thugs+n+harmony+bone+4+life |title=bone thugs -n- harmony - Bone 4 Life - Amazon.com Music |website=Amazon.com |access-date=May 24, 2017}}</ref> in September 2005. ''Thug Stories'' featured a slightly more mature style, and the group leaned more heavily towards its [[harmony|harmonic]] roots than its "[[gangsta rap|thug]]" origins. The album sold 38,000 in its first week and peaked at {{abbr|No.|Number}} 25 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]<ref name="Billboard albums" /> and {{abbr|No.|Number}} 1 on the [[Independent Albums]] chart.

===2007: ''Strength & Loyalty'' and ''T.H.U.G.S.''===
Originally to be titled ''The Bone Thugs Story'', ''[[Strength & Loyalty]]'' was released on May 8, 2007 on [[Interscope Records]] imprint [[Full Surface Records]]. Being their first major album after an absence of nearly five years, the album debuted at {{abbr|No.|Number}} 2 on the ''Billboard'' 200, and {{abbr|No.|Number}} 1 on iTunes and the ''Billboard'' [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|urban music]] charts.<ref name="Billboard albums" /> The album contains guest appearances by [[Mariah Carey]], [[The Game (rapper)|the Game]], [[will.i.am]], [[Akon]], [[Twista]], [[Bow Wow (rapper)|Bow Wow]], [[Yolanda Adams]], and [[Felecia Lindsey-Howse|Felecia]]. Producers on the album included [[Swizz Beatz]], [[Akon]], Pretty Boy, Bradd Young, [[DJ Toomp]], [[Jermaine Dupri]], [[will.i.am]], and others. The executive producer of the album was [[Swizz Beatz]]. The first single was "[[I Tried (Bone Thugs-N-Harmony song)|I Tried]]", which was their first top-10 hit in 10 years, peaking at number 6 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The second single was "[[Lil L.O.V.E.|Lil Love]]", which failed to reach the success of its predecessor. The album has been certified [[gold disc|gold]] by the RIAA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bonethugsnharmony.com/news/default.aspx?nid=9429 |title=Bone Thugs-N-Harmony: News: ''Strength & Loyalty'' Certified Gold |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410062053/http://www.bonethugsnharmony.com/news/default.aspx?nid=9429 |archive-date=April 10, 2008 }}</ref>

2007 also saw the release of the semi-autobiographical film ''I Tried'', directed by [[Rich Newey]], which explored what might have happened to Bone Thugs-N-Harmony had they not gotten their break with Eazy-E. Layzie, Krayzie, and Wish Bone starred in the film, playing themselves.<ref name="AllHipHop">{{cite web |url=http://allhiphop.com/2007/06/21/bone-thugs-n-harmony-shoot-new-movie-launch-new-watch-collection/ |title=Bone Thugs-N-Harmony Shoot New Movie; Launch New Watch Collection |website=AllHipHop.com |date=June 21, 2007 |access-date=August 28, 2015}}</ref> Also in 2007, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony won the [[American Music Award]] for Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Band, Duo or Group.

''[[T.H.U.G.S. (Bone Thugs-n-Harmony album)|T.H.U.G.S.]]'', an album featuring previously unreleased, largely remixed Bone Thugs-N-Harmony songs that hadn't made the final cut of ''[[BTNHResurrection]]'' and ''[[Thug World Order]]'', was released on November 13, 2007 by their former record label [[Ruthless Records]]. Although the album embodies old tracks, there are some notable changes: new beats, distorted production, voice manipulation, and new song titles. The sole single off the album was "Young Thugs", which was accompanied by a newly filmed music video featuring Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, and Wish.

In November 2007, Layzie Bone confirmed that he had completed ''[[Bone Brothers III]]'' with Bizzy Bone, spurring speculation about a full Bone reunion. In a video interview, Krayzie Bone stated that they all wanted to reunite, but that record label issues might prevent an official reunion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-25OrAQ_gM | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211031/h-25OrAQ_gM| archive-date=2021-10-31 | url-status=live|title=ThugLine TV – Krayzie Bone speaks on reunion |publisher=YouTube |date=June 12, 2008 |access-date=March 29, 2012}}{{cbignore}}</ref>
