'''The Weakerthans''' are an award-winning and Juno-nominated Canadian [[indie rock]] band from [[Winnipeg]]. The band, led by [[John K. Samson]], has released four studio albums and is currently inactive.

==History==
The band was formed in 1997 in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]] by [[John K. Samson]], after he left the punk band [[Propagandhi]] to start a publishing company. Samson joined bassist John P. Sutton and drummer [[Jason Tait]] of Red Fisher, another band from Winnipeg's punk scene,<ref>[https://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/article/a-comprehensive-look-at-winnipegs-rock-history-part-2 "A Comprehensive Look At Winnipeg’s PC Punk Scene"]. ''Noisey'', Sheldon Birnie Sep 22 2014,</ref> and created The Weakerthans as a vehicle for a more melodic and introspective brand of songwriting than their previous projects.

The origin of the band's name was explained, in 2004 by Samson, as having come from "a few places." The first was a line from the 1992 film ''[[The Lover (1992 film)|The Lover]]'': "Go ahead, I'm weaker than you can possibly imagine." A second (he gave only two) was a line from Ralph Chaplin's union anthem "[[Solidarity Forever]]": "What force on earth is weaker than the feeble strength of one?" The band includes this line in the song "Pamphleteer" from the album ''[[Left and Leaving]]''.<ref>{{cite interview| subject= John K.

The band's debut album, ''[[Fallow (The Weakerthans album)|Fallow]]'', was released in 1997 on [[G7 Welcoming Committee Records]], and garnered positive reviews from Canadian music critics.<ref>Haggart, B.

It also became the band's best-selling record to date, and in September appeared on the !earshot National Top 50 Chart as a result of significant airplay on Canadian radio.<ref>[http://earshot-online.com/charts/index.cfm?intChartTypeID=101&dWeekOfID=2003-09-16 "The National Top 50 For the Week Ending: Tuesday, September 16, 2003"].
