Until he was twelve years old, Tinie lived on the [[Aylesbury Estate]] in south-east [[London]] with his parents and three younger siblings: Kelly, Kelvin, and Marian.<ref name="Mirror" /> The family later moved to [[Plumstead]], with Tinie attending [[St Paul's Academy, Abbey Wood|St. Paul's Catholic School]] in nearby [[Abbey Wood]]. After earning 10 [[GCSE]]s,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/feb/13/tinie-tempah-interview-brit-awards|title=Tinie Tempah interview: "It's a new day, a new age, a new outlook"|first=Elizabeth|last=Day|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=13 February 2011|access-date=13 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118080332/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/feb/13/tinie-tempah-interview-brit-awards|archive-date=18 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> he sat [[GCE Advanced Level|A-Levels]] in Media Studies, Psychology, and Religious Studies at [[Saint Francis Xavier College (England)|Saint Francis Xavier Sixth Form College]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/tinie-tempah-hes-going-to-be-huge-2219315.html|title=Tinie Tempah: He's going to be huge|first=Ian|last=Burrell|date=19 February 2011|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|access-date=13 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210223730/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/tinie-tempah-hes-going-to-be-huge-2219315.html|archive-date=10 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24582845|title=Tinie Tempah: "I believe in the magic of music"|first=Mark|last=Savage|date=24 October 2013|publisher=BBC|access-date=22 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117010017/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24582845|archive-date=17 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> At twelve years old, Tinie conceived his [[stage name]] after viewing the music video for [[So Solid Crew]]'s "[[21 Seconds]]". He used a thesaurus in class, juxtaposing "tempah" ([[wiktionary:temper|temper]]), which he saw under "angry", with "tinie" ([[wiktionary:tiny|tiny]]), to ameliorate the aggressive sound of "tempah".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news/tinie-tempah-used-thesaurus-to-find-stage-name_1249518|title=Tinie Tempah Used Thesaurus to Find Stage Name|author=Wenn|website=Contactmusic.com|date=10 October 2011|access-date=3 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206172945/http://www.contactmusic.com/news/tinie-tempah-used-thesaurus-to-find-stage-name_1249518|archive-date=6 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

Regarding his London upbringing, Tinie states, "London is one of the only places in the world where you can live in a [[Council house|council]] block and see a beautiful semi-detached house across the street. Growing up around that was inspirational, it kept me motivated."<ref name="Tinie Tempah Official Website Biography" />

== Career history ==
=== 2005–2008: Early career ===
Tinie, then known as Tinie Tempah,<ref name=":0" /> began his music career in 2005 when he joined the Aftershock Hooligans (Aftershock →→Records), recording hundreds of songs amongst the fellow Hooligans. His first mixtape, "Chapter&nbsp;1: Verse 22", was released via Aftershock Records in 2005, as a free mixtape. In 2006, Tinie gained a great deal of airplay on British music TV channel [[Now 70s|Channel U]] for his song "Tears", and later on gained more recognition for "Wifey". Later in the year, he collaborated on a track with grime artist Ultra and [[Record producers|producers]] and songwriters Agent X. He released the mixtape ''Hood Economics Room 147: The 80 Minute Course'' in 2007 and left the label later that year. When asked why he left, he stated that he felt Aftershock didn't respect him as an artist and that it was time to move on.

Tinie, together with his manager and cousin Dumi Oburota founded the [[Independent record label|independent label]] Disturbing London primarily as an outlet for Tinie's music, but with the idea of also signing other young artists. According to Dumi: "We wanted to have a platform to put out our music and there wasn't any [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]] or [[Roc-A-Fella Records|Roc-A-Fella]] label equivalent in England. [Also] I wanted to create a major independent label with quality artists. I felt like the major labels had lost the passion for music."<ref name="hitquarters">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_DOint.html |title=Interview with Dumi Oburota |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=7 March 2011 |access-date=15 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711172104/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_DOint.html |archive-date=11 July 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> The activities of the label were initially largely funded by student loans and the proceeds from buying and selling cars.<ref name="hitquarters" /> Disturbing London also produce a clothing range that Tinie wears and promotes.

When scout and music consultant Jade Richardson saw Tinie performing at the 2009 [[Wireless Festival]] she called [[Parlophone Records]] president [[Miles Leonard]] saying: "You've got to check out this guy Tinie Tempah. He came on at lunchtime and there's about 1,000 kids screaming for him. He's only put out one independent release and he's got this huge audience."<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_MLeonardInt.html |title=Interview with Miles Leonard |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=7 February 2011 |access-date=11 February 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69MDHDVLm?url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_MLeonardInt.html |archive-date=22 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Leonard and [[A&R]] Nathan Thompson visited Tinie and his manager Dumi at their studio a few weeks later and were hugely impressed to hear about the work they had already done in developing Tinie's career and by the ambitious plans they had for his future.<ref name="hitquarters.com" /> Leonard told [[HitQuarters]]: "I thought it was incredible that an artist and manager were doing so much so soon with so little... That impressed as much as the music."<ref name="hitquarters.com" /> Tinie announced his signing to Parlophone in October 2009 by running a competition on his blog, with the winner invited to [[high tea]] at [[Claridges]] to celebrate the deal.<ref name="Milk and 2 Sugars">{{cite web|url=http://milkand2sugars.wordpress.com/2009/10/10/tinie-tempah-signs-to-parlophoneemi/|title=Tinie Tempah signs to Parlophone/EMI!
