==History==
We Butter the Bread with Butter was founded in 2007 by Marcel Neumann, who was originally  guitarist for [[Martin Kesici]]'s band,<ref name="smash-mag">{{Cite web|url=http://www.smash-mag.net/index.php/interviews/aktuelle-interviews/we-butter-the-bread-with-butter-uiiii-bree-jaaa-ja-bree-ull-ull.html|title=Interview |website=Smash-mag.com|access-date=12 October 2020}}</ref> and Tobias Schultka. The band was originally meant as a joke, but progressed into being a more serious musical duo. The name for the band has no particular meaning, although its origins were suggested from when the two original members were driving in a car operated by Marcel Neumann and an accident almost occurred. Neumann found Schultka "so funny that he briefly lost control of the vehicle."<ref name="smash-mag"/> Many of their songs from this point were [[cover (music)|covers]] of [[German folklore|German folk tales]] and [[nursery rhyme]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hardkern.de/reviews/show/we-butter-the-bread-with-butter/das-monster-aus-dem-schrank/|title=Review |website=Hardkern.de|access-date=12 October 2020}}</ref>
