==History==
[[File:Drake fox theatre.jpg|thumb|right|Drake founded the label in 2012]]
The label's roots can be traced back to 2006, when Drake's first official mixtape, ''[[Room for Improvement (mixtape)|Room for Improvement]]'', was released under the unofficial record label "All Things Fresh" which eventually became "October's Very Own". Drake later raised the profile of the label by prominently featuring OVO throughout his music, regularly mentioning the label in songs and on stage, as well as promoting OVO merchandise.

The record label was officially founded in 2012 by Drake and long-time collaborators Noah "40" Shebib and Oliver El-Khatib following the success of Drake's third studio album ''[[Nothing Was the Same]]''. According to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', Drake signed a partnership deal with [[Warner Records]] similar to that of [[Rick Ross]]' record company. Though Ross is signed as a solo artist to [[Epic Records|Epic]], the artists on Ross' [[Maybach Music Group]] label are signed to [[Atlantic Records]], former partners with Warner.

Drake was signed as a solo artist to [[Republic Records]] through [[Young Money Entertainment|Young Money]] and [[Cash Money Records|Cash Money]] for nine years.  Drake's 2018 release Scorpion was his last project under Young Money/Cash Money. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rap-up.com/2020/12/17/lil-wayne-umg-deal-drake-nicki-minaj-masters/|title = Report: Lil Wayne's UMG Deal Includes Drake and Nicki Minaj's Masters}}</ref> On the other hand, the artists Drake signs to OVO Sound through Warner have their content distributed through the latter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1698366/drake-ovo-warner-bros.jhtml |title=Drake's OVO Label Flies To Warner Bros.

Upon founding the label in 2012, Drake and 40 signed frequent collaborators [[Boi-1da]], [[T-Minus (producer)|T-Minus]], [[Mike Zombie]] to the label as in-house producers (the latter two are the only active signees in the label to come outside of Canada).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/08/10-artists-that-should-sign-to-drakes-ovo-sound/7/ |title=10 Artists That Should Sign To Drake's OVO Sound – Page 7 of 11 – XXL |publisher=Xxlmag.com |date=August 12, 2013 |access-date=August 25, 2013}}</ref> In April 2013, it was reported that Drake was close to signing the label's first [[Music artist (occupation)|recording artist]], [[PartyNextDoor]], which he ended up revealing shortly thereafter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/bangers/2013/04/listen-to-partynextdoor-drakes-new-artist-signing-to-ovo-soon/ |title=Listen to PARTYNEXTDOOR, Drake's New Artist Signing to OVO (Soon) – XXL |publisher=Xxlmag.com |date=April 22, 2013 |access-date=May 7, 2013}}</ref> In August 2013, Drake announced that he signed Toronto music duo [[Majid Jordan]] to OVO Sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/08/drake-wants-hold-on-were-going-home-to-be-played-at-weddings/|title=Drake Wants New Single To Be Played At Weddings|work=XXL}}</ref> OB O'Brien and [[iLoveMakonnen]] would soon sign in 2014, with the latter being the first non-Canadian act and second non-Canadian signee after to Mike Zombie. Makonnen would eventually leave OVO Sound in April 2016, wishing to pursue his interests as a solo artist with Warner. Canadian rap artist [[Roy Woods]] and R&B duo [[Dvsn]], composed of singer Daniel Daley and producer Nineteen85, soon joined the label in 2015 and 2016, with each act releasing an [[Extended play|EP]] and studio album respectively.<ref name="rollingstone">On June 10, 2017, newest signee Plaza's project, Shadow EP, debuted on OVO Sound Radio episode 45.

===OVO Sound Radio===
OVO Sound Radio was a radio program that aired on [[Apple Music|Beats 1]], fortnightly on Saturdays. The show primarily aired newer material, with at least one song premiering in each broadcast. The show's initial airing was on July 11, 2015, and it was hosted by Drake and Oliver El-Khatib. The show is notable for debuting hit Drake singles, such as platinum-selling "[[Hotline Bling]]", and chart-topping "[[One Dance]]". The show ended on October 27, 2018. On March 4, 2021 Drake announced that he and Oliver would debut their new 24 hour radio station, "SOUND42" on [[Sirius XM]] featuring the return of OVO Sound Radio that same night.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Listen to Drake's OVO Sound Radio on SiriusXM's SOUND 42 Channel|url=https://www.complex.com/music/stream-drakes-ovo-sound-radio-siriusxm-sound-42|access-date=2021-03-05|website=Complex|language=en}}</ref>

===OVO Clothing===
OVO Clothing was launched in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/style/2015/10/history-of-ovo-clothing-ovo-timeline|title=How the OVO Clothing Label Evolved With Drake's Career|access-date=August 11, 2016}}</ref> The series of clothing began with a series of collaborations between [[Roots Canada]] and OVO, which produced several parkas, jackets and other collaborations. In 2013, merchandise for the OVO figurehead included collaborations with the [[Toronto Raptors]], which coincided with Drake becoming the franchise's Global Ambassador. OVO has since morphed into a clothing line in itself, releasing a slew of clothes during every season of the year. [[T-shirt]]s, [[sweatshirt]]s, [[varsity jacket]]s, baseball hats, and knit beanies are seasonal installations. OVO Clothing oversaw the opening of the first OVO store for the brand's clothing in downtown [[Toronto]], opening on December 6, 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Drake Opens Flagship OVO Store in Totonto|url=https://us.fashionnetwork.com/news/Drake-opens-flagship-ovo-store-in-toronto,859433.html|url-status=live|website=Fashion Network}}</ref> Exactly a year after the opening in Toronto, OVO stores expanded to the United States, opening a [[flagship store]] in Los Angeles, California. Its New York store opened in December 2016 on [[Bond Street (Manhattan)|Bond Street]], and its Chicago store in August 2019 on Walton Street in [[Gold Coast Historic District (Chicago)|Gold Coast]]. OVO also opened its first location in Vancouver in December 2018.<ref>[https://www.chicagotribune.com%2Fcolumns%2Fryan-ori%2Fct-biz-drake-ovo-store-gold-coast-ryan-ori-20190717-xuaa7eg2izhazhxourwgjfn4wi-story.html&psig=AOvVaw3HY7sqrqW6i0YryF_SWvs8&ust=1565741032135361 Rap star Drake’s streetwear brand to open Gold Coast store] RYAN ORI, ''CHICAGO TRIBUNE'', July 17, 2019</ref>
Other OVO collaborations have included [[Canada Goose (clothing)|Canada Goose]], and [[Air Jordan]].

Its pre-2016 collection was composed of basketball shorts, OVO jerseys, [[track jacket]]s, and baggy hoodies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/first-look-at-ovos-pre-fall-2016-collection-news.23382.html?image=11 |title=OVO Apparel Line Pre-fall collection|last=Rooney |first=Kyle |date=August 10, 2016 |website=Hotnewhiphop |access-date=August 10, 2016}}</ref>

On November 9, 2020, it was revealed via the OVO Clothing Instagram account that [[National Hockey League|NHL]] [[Hockey Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Wayne Gretzky]] would be a model for the Fall and Winter 2020 collection.<ref>{{Cite web|title=October's Very Own on Instagram: "The Great One, Wayne Gretzky.
