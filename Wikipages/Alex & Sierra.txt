Alex & Sierra auditioned in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], making it to the next round after wowing the judges with a sultry version of [[Britney Spears]]' "[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]".

For Big Band night, Alex & Sierra performed [[Taylor Swift]]'s hit "[[I Knew You Were Trouble]]".<ref name=BigBand/> Demi said that they didn't like the arrangement at first, but Alex & Sierra made them like it by the end. Simon said that their arrangement was clever and cool and not obvious, and also praised Sierra: "You just shut up the witches of Eastwick here because that was a great, great vocal performance." They later faced off against the others in a group performance of "Cry Me A River", in which they received praise from Kelly, who said they "soared".<ref name=BigBand>{{cite web|last=Wightman|first=Catriona|title='The X Factor' USA Big Band Week recap: Swinging and swooning|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/s141/the-x-factor-us/news/a534421/the-x-factor-usa-big-band-week-recap-swinging-and-swooning.html|publisher=DigitalSpy|access-date=Nov 28, 2013 <!-- , 11:24am EST --> }}</ref>
