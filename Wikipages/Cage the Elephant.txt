==History==
===Previous careers===
Before he was a band member for Cage the Elephant, Matt Shultz worked in construction as a plumber.  In an interview with the "Rock It Out!" blog for ''Consequence of Sound'', he said he felt like if he did not quit that job, he would be stuck there for the rest of his life. He left to work at a sandwich bar with Brad Shultz, who had previously worked in telemarketing. Daniel Tichenor held a job at [[Lowe's]] and Jared Champion worked in a pet store.

Nick Bockrath is part of the band [[Nicos Gun]] and previously played bass with [[Morning Teleportation]]. Cage got to know him through their friendship with that band. Matthan Minster formed a band called YOURS in 2010.

===Formation and name===
Members of Cage the Elephant had previously been involved in the band Perfect Confusion when they were in high school and released a self-titled LP in 2005. Matt Shultz was also in an experimental punk band in middle school called Left Nostril.

The band's name, according to lead singer Matt Shultz, came from an incident in 2006 when a mentally disturbed man approached the band after a show.  He hugged Shultz and kept repeating the sentence "You have to cage the elephant" over and over again.<ref name="spin_WhyT">{{Cite web | title = Why They're Called… Cage the Elephant {{!}} SPIN | author = David Marchese | work = [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] | date = July 6, 2010 | access-date = 2016-06-12 | url = http://www.spin.com/2010/07/why-theyre-called-cage-elephant/?PageSpeed=noscript | quote = "The whole time he was saying, 'You have to cage the elephant, you have to cage the elephant.'

===Early years and ''Cage the Elephant'' (2007–2010)===

[[File:Cagetheelephant in 2008 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Brad Shultz at the Barfly in 2008]]
The band signed with [[Relentless Records]] after showcasing at the 2007 [[South by Southwest]] music festival. Their first tour was as a support act for [[Queens of the Stone Age]] in Canada. They then moved to London, England,<ref>{{cite web|title=Cage the Elephant Clears Up Hippie Commune Rumors |url=http://www.blackbookmag.com/article/cage-the-elephant-clears-up-hippie-commune-rumors/7395 |publisher=[[BlackBook Magazine]] |date=April 30, 2009 |access-date=2009-05-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720201259/http://www.blackbookmag.com/article/cage-the-elephant-clears-up-hippie-commune-rumors/7395 |archive-date=July 20, 2009 }}</ref> to the [[Leyton]] area on the outskirts of the city. At the time, Lincoln Parish was only 16 years old, so in order to be able to move, his parents had to sign over parental guardianship to the band. In 2008, they appeared on the British show ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]'' with [[Coldplay]], [[Sia Furler|Sia]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[John Mellencamp]], and [[Amy LaVere]] (all of whom served as audience to the band). They released their [[eponymous]] debut album, ''[[Cage the Elephant (album)|Cage the Elephant]]'', on June 23, 2008 in the United Kingdom and April 21, 2009 in the United States, Japan, Australia, and Canada, to mostly favorable reviews.
