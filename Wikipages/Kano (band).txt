'''Kano''' was an [[Italo disco]] music project formed in Milan, Italy in 1979 by producers/musicians Luciano Ninzatti, Stefano Pulga and Matteo Bonsanto.

==History==
Kano's debut single was the 1980 international hit "I'm Ready", combining elements of 1970s disco, funk and R&B while extensively using synthesizers and percussive handclaps as well as raw-processed and vocoderized vocals. Kano's self-titled debut album also included "It's a War", "Ahjia", "Now Baby Now" and the instrumental track "Cosmic Voyager". "I'm Ready" peaked at No. 21 on the U.S. [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles and Tracks|Black Singles]] chart, while "It's a War" and "Ahjia" were also hits on the [[Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] chart in the U.S., reaching No. 2 for five weeks.<ref>{{cite book |title= Hot Dance/Disco: 1974-2003|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |author-link=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=142}}</ref>

The project went on to record two other albums, including 1981's ''New York Cake'' (which included the minor hits "She's a Star", "Don't Try to Stop Me" and "Can't Hold Back") and 1983's ''Another Life'' (including the title track and "I Need Love"). Both albums introduced Kano listeners to West Indian-born singer Glen White. Their last song was 1985's "This Is the Night".

== Sampling and usage in media ==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2015}}
"I'm Ready" was later [[sampling (music)|sampled]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} on several songs, such as Gigolo Tony's 1986 hit "Hoki Poki" and Rofo's 1983 hit "Flashlight on a Disconight". The most well-known use of it as a sample is on [[Tag Team (group)|Tag Team]]'s 1993 hit, "[[Whoomp! (There It Is)]]". "Now Baby Now" was sampled by house artist [[Felix Da Housecat]] for his track "Glitz Rock" which appeared on the 2001 album ''[[Kittenz and Thee Glitz]]''. "Another Life" was remixed by [[Master Blaster (band)|Master Blaster]] which features on their 2003 album ''We Love Italo Disco''. "Another Life" was also sampled in the 2005 track "Discopolis" by Lifelike & Kris Menace. "Ikeya Seki" was sampled by French [[electro house]] artist [[Kavinsky]] for his track "Grand Canyon", which appeared on his 2007 EP, ''[[1986 (Kavinsky song)|1986]]''. Finnish rapper [[Petri Nygård]] sampled "Ahjia" on his 2009 song "Kotibileet". An arpeggio from "Another Life" was sampled in the 2011 single "[[Reaching Out (Nero song)|Reaching Out]]" by [[Nero (band)|Nero]].

"I'm Ready" was used as an intro/outro theme in the TV interstitial ''TV PIXxxx'' on WPIX-TV Channel 11, New York City.
