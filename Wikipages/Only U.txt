"'''Only U'''" is a song by American singer [[Ashanti (entertainer)|Ashanti]] from her third studio album, ''[[Concrete Rose]]'' (2004). The song's introduction uses a [[sampling (music)|sample]] of [[Club Nouveau]]'s 1986 song "[[Why You Treat Me So Bad]]". "Only U" is a [[rock music|rock-tinged]] song, that finds Ashanti in love and willing to do anything to be with the one she loves, no matter the cost.

Released on October 18, 2004, as the album's [[lead single]], the track reached number thirteen on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in January 2005. It peaked at number two in the United Kingdom and number four in Ireland, becoming her most successful single in both countries. The song received generally favorable reviews from music critics, with most praising its sensual lyrics and her vocal performance.

== Background and release ==
After her successful second studio album ''[[Chapter II (Ashanti album)|Chapter II]]'' (2003), which topped the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and was certified Platinum, spawned two hit singles, "[[Rock wit U (Awww Baby)]]" and "[[Rain on Me (Ashanti song)|Rain on Me]]",<ref name=allmusicchapterII>{{cite web|title=Chapter II - Ashanti : Awards : AllMusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/chapter-ii-mw0000032733/awards|work=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=March 28, 2013}}</ref> and earned her three [[Grammy]] nominations,<ref name=rockonthenet>{{cite news|title=Rock on the Net: Ashanti|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-a/ashanti.htm|access-date=March 28, 2013|newspaper=Rock on the Net}}</ref> Ashanti released her first [[Christmas album]] called "[[Ashanti's Christmas]]" in 2003.

"The Bland Is Out There" review was positive, writing that, "The beat complements Ashanti's slight voice It's the one single so far which has fit right into her range.

== Music videos ==
There are two official versions of the [[music video|video]], both directed by [[Hype Williams]] and shot in [[Vancouver]] and [[Mexico City]]. It is notable for making use of a blue-hue effect in numerous shots with overt noir and neo-noir influences in many shots. The first version is the original video (which has an alternate version itself) and the second version is the Dance Version, which was only aired on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]].

=== Original version ===
The original version is shot in widescreen format but the slots that are normally left black at the top and bottom of the screen were replaced with upside down or reversed images of the main shot in the middle of the screen, which flickered back and forth to give the illusion that two scenes were playing at once. The alternate version had the scenes shown in regular widescreen format with the shots and the top and bottom of the screen plain black.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0zs-3-5JEo |title=Only U (Alternate Version) |work=[[YouTube]] |access-date=June 7, 2008}}</ref> It starts off with a ''[[Blade Runner]]''-inspired environment and imagery of Ashanti's face depicted on a skyscraper—similar to a scene in ''Blade Runner''. In addition, there is a scene where she is sitting down on a seat while smoking as she appears to be watching something through a projector—again, a shot similar to that of a scene in ''Blade Runner''. The rest of the video features Ashanti in various situations, posing and wearing a variety of outfits. In one scene, Ashanti is in the shower and in another she is inside a [[pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]]-like lamp as air gushes from beneath, creating a vacuum effect - reminiscent of the scene in Blade Runner where Zhora goes to dry her hair inside a clear, fishbowl-like dryer. The video ends with her and a group of female dancers performing the song in concert. Bottles of [[Herbal Essences]] hair products can be seen during the shower scene as Ashanti was the then-new spokesperson for the haircare company.<ref>{{cite web |last=Slotek |first=Jim |url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/A/Ashanti/2005/03/16/962776-sun.html |title=Ashanti lets her hair down |work=[[Toronto Sun]] |date=March 16, 2005 |access-date=March 20, 2009 |via=[[Jam!]] |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711063344/http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/A/Ashanti/2005/03/16/962776-sun.html |archive-date=July 11, 2012}}</ref> [[Channel 7 (musician)|Seven Aurelius]], who co-wrote and produced the song, makes a guest appearance at the beginning and at the end of the video playing the guitar.

=== Dance version ===
The "Dance version" of the video consisted of the dance scene that is also shown at the end of the original video, with Ashanti and the back-up dancers dancing throughout the entire video. Seven Aurelius makes a cameo appearance in this version as well at the beginning and at the end of the video as the guitar player. Director Hype Williams featured his signature style of widescreen format in this version of the video also, except the slots that are normally left blank at the top and bottom of the screen were replaced with upside down or reversed images of the main shot in the middle of the screen.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a21wvCrc-9o |title=Only U (Dance Version) |work=[[YouTube]] |access-date=June 7, 2008}}</ref>
