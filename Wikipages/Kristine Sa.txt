Sa was born in Song Be, a small town near Saigon ([[Ho Chi Minh City]]) in Vietnam. When she was six, her family moved to Canada and she grew up in Toronto. She enjoyed singing and performing since she was little, and attended a special performing arts school in ninth grade.<ref name="bio vietscape"/> She was in a television pilot called ''Wexford''.<ref name="asianweek"/> When she was in high school, a friend of hers contacted Nemesis Records to look at her webpage and the CEO Minh-Dan Pham was interested in her writing. She sent in a demo cover of "[[Unbreak My Heart]]" and a self-written song and was soon signed.<ref name="bio vietscape"/><ref name="bio asiafinest"/>

While she was a college student at [[York University]], she released her debut album ''I Never Knew'' in 2002. It contains a mix of songs written and performed by Sa with what Steve Diabo of Animefringe calls "heartfelt ballads and experimental pop".<ref name="anime fringe"/> It was marketed mostly through online radio stations,<ref name="anime fringe"/> selling in Taiwan, Australia, and the United Kingdom. She toured in the United States, and became popular on the Internet and the anime convention circuit, including [[AnimeFest]] in Dallas in 2002,<ref name="anime fringe"/> and [[FanimeCon]] in San Jose in 2003.<ref name="asianweek">{{cite web|url=http://www.asianweek.com/2003/06/20/pop-asian-pacific-american-style-kristine-sa-to-perform-at-fanimecon-2003/|title=Pop, Asian Pacific American Style: Kristine Sa to perform at FanimeCon 2003|work=asianweek.com|accessdate=5 February 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205064601/http://www.asianweek.com/2003/06/20/pop-asian-pacific-american-style-kristine-sa-to-perform-at-fanimecon-2003/|archivedate=5 February 2016}}</ref> She continued her career with her second album, ''Rebirth'' in 2004.
