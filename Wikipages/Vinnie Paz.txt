== Biography ==

=== Early career (1992–1997) ===
Paz was born in [[Sicily]], Italy, where he lived for a short time before moving with his family to [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. He is of Sicilian/Italian heritage.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vulpescu |first=Andrei |url=https://archive.today/4QUQj |title=Jedi Mind Tricks, lectie de Hip-Hop la Agronomie|publisher=bestmusic|language=ro |date=March 14, 2007 |access-date=November 15, 2014}}</ref> He has both Italian and American citizenship. Paz originally started rapping with fellow Jedi Mind Tricks member [[Stoupe]] in his basement.

In 1996, Paz released the ''[[Amber Probe]]'' EP. This was the debut EP from the duo and it was released in 1996. It featured guest appearance from [[The Lost Children of Babylon]]. It was in 1997, Jedi Mind Tricks released their debut album; ''[[The Psycho-Social, Chemical, Biological & Electro-Magnetic Manipulation of Human Consciousness]]'' (often abbreviated as ''The Psycho-Social CD''). The group only consisted of Paz and [[Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind]] at this time and featured Apathy, [[Jus Allah]], and [[Black Thought]].

=== From Ikon to Vinnie, forming AOTP, ''Violent by Design'' (1998–2002) ===
In 1998, Paz formed [[Army of the Pharaohs]]. Paz formed the horrorcore outfit with the original roster of [[Bahamadia]], [[Chief Kamachi]], Virtuoso, [[7L & Esoteric]], plus Jedi Mind Tricks' other members [[Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind]] and [[Jus Allah]]. The group first released the "Five Perfect Exertions" and "War Ensemble" 12" on Paz's short-lived Recordings in 1998, but then the underground supergroup remained silent for several years. Together they released ''[[The Five Perfect Exertions]]''.

In 2000, Paz, along with Jedi Mind Tricks, released his second album, ''[[Violent by Design]]''. Stoupe and Paz recruited New Jersey rapper Jus Allah to join them on the album, and while he was never inducted into the group, it can be assumed he became JMT's third member on the release, as his contributions were not marked as "featuring Jus Allah", while other close group affiliates such as Army of the Pharaohs members Chief Kamachi, Esoteric and Virtuoso were marked as featured guests.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rapreviews.com/archive/BTTL_violentbydesign.html|title=Jedi Mind Tricks :: Violent by Design :: Superregular Recordings|access-date=November 15, 2014}}</ref> On the album, Ikon the Verbal Hologram changed his name to "Vinnie Paz", naming himself after [[Rhode Island]] boxer [[Vinny Pazienza]].

=== ''Visions of Gandhi'', ''Legacy of Blood'' and collaborations (2003–2006) ===
[[file:Vinnie Paz 2.jpg|thumb|Paz in 2006]]
In 2003, Jedi Mind Tricks released their third studio album, ''[[Visions of Gandhi]]''. The album title was inspired by [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]]'s verse on the song "Affirmative Action" from [[Nas]]' 1996 album ''[[It Was Written]]'', in which she raps "They praise Allah with visions of Gandhi". Paz explained that it was "always something that stuck in my head but I never applied it to anything. Then I thought with everything going on in Palestine, the war with Iraq, [[Mumia Abu-Jamal|Mumia's]] in jail. I just felt this is a time right now that the world and society need someone like [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]]. So Visions of Gandhi just kind of reflects that."<ref>Joel & Andy.

In 2005, Paz shifted his focus back on to the supergroup Army of the Pharaohs. They worked to release their debut album, ''[[The Torture Papers (album)|The Torture Papers]]''. It was released on March 21, 2006, on [[Babygrande Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.undergroundhiphop.com/store/detail.asp?UPC=BBG0324CD|title=Army Of The Pharaohs – Ritual Of Battle – reviews, track listing, album stream|author=Muhammet the Slav|date=May 30, 2014|work=UGHH|access-date=November 15, 2014}}</ref> After the release of this Paz went back to his group Jedi Mind Tricks and worked on fifth studio album, ''[[Servants in Heaven, Kings in Hell]]''.

In 2006, Vinnie Paz released his first solo album, ''The Sound & the Fury''. It featured guest appearance from [[Apathy (rapper)|Apathy]] and [[OuterSpace]]. It was hosted by [[DJ Kwestion]] and had 19 tracks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.datpiff.com/Vinnie-Paz-The-Sound-The-Fury-mixtape.13114.html|title=The Sound & The Fury (mixtape)|work=DatPiff|access-date=November 15, 2014}}</ref>

=== ''Ritual of Battle'', ''A History of Violence'', ''The Unholy Terror'' and solo career (2007–2010) ===
[[file:Vinnie Paz 2007 (2).jpg|thumb|upright|Paz in 2007]]
Paz got together members of Army of the Pharaohs to release their second album, ''[[Ritual of Battle]]''. It was released September 21, 2007, on [[Babygrande Records]]. The album's first single was "Bloody Tears", featuring Planetary, Doap Nixon, Demoz, and Paz, produced by DJ Kwestion. The song was based on the [[Castlevania]] tune of the same name.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuQnOzmk1E|title=Army of The Pharaohs - "Bloody Tears" [Official Video]|work=YouTube|access-date=November 15, 2014}}</ref>

On November 11, 2008, Jedi Mind Tricks released their sixth studio album, ''[[A History of Violence (album)|A History of Violence]]''. The album sold 4,451 units in its first week out.<ref>{{cite web|last=Paine |first=Jake |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.8116/title.hip-hop-album-sales-the-week-ending-11-17-08 |title=Hip Hop Album Sales: The Week Ending 11/17/08 &#124; Get The Latest Hip Hop News, Rap News & Hip Hop Album Sales |publisher=HipHop DX |date=November 19, 2008 |access-date=September 19, 2011}}</ref> Just like most albums, it was released on [[Babygrande Records]].<ref>[http://www.babygrande.com/news.jsp?id=153 Babygrande News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006213900/http://www.babygrande.com/news.jsp?id=153 |date=October 6, 2008 }}</ref> The album followed multiple summer releases from the Jedi Mind Tricks camp, including the group's first DVD, titled ''Divine Fire: The Story of Jedi Mind Tricks'', and the Vinnie Paz-executive produced projects ''Jedi Mind Tricks presents [[Doap Nixon]]: Sour Diesel'', ''Jedi Mind Tricks presents [[King Syze]]: [[The Labor Union]]'', and ''Jedi Mind Tricks presents [[OuterSpace]]: God's Fury''.<ref>[http://www.babygrande.com/news.jsp?id=137 Babygrande Jedi Mind Tricks News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080711035722/http://www.babygrande.com/news.jsp?id=137 |date=July 11, 2008 }}</ref>

In 2010, ''[[The Unholy Terror]]'' was released. It is the third studio album by Army of the Pharaohs.

It was released through Babygrande Records and through Paz's own Enemy Soil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thacorner.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1397:doom-reviews-the-army-of-the-pharaohs--the-unholy-terror&catid=41:music-reviews&Itemid=182 |title=The Leading The Corner Site on the Net |publisher=thacorner.net |access-date=October 4, 2012}}</ref>

It was during this time Paz released his debut solo album, ''[[Season of the Assassin]]''. Many critics said the album was a step forward for Paz as an artist. "Not only has he all-but perfected his grimy braggadocio, but he also exhibits unique storytelling abilities that will make critics who dismiss him as just another hardcore rapper bite their tongues clean off." said Sean Ryon, writer of ''HipHopDX''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/album-reviews/id.1460/title.vinnie-paz-season-of-the-assassin |title=Vinnie Paz - The Season of the Assassin - Underground Hip Hop|publisher=HipHopDX |access-date=October 4, 2012}}</ref> It was supposed to be called ''Assassin's Creed'' but Paz changed it due to legal issues with [[Ubisoft]]. The release date for the album was on June 22, 2010.<ref>{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=vinnie paz|chart=all}}</ref> A few months later, Paz released the ''[[Prayer for the Assassin]]'' [[Extended play|EP]].

=== ''Violence Begets Violence'' and ''God of the Serengeti'' (2011–2012) ===
{{quote box  |bgcolor=#bbccff |salign=left|width=500px |align=left| quote = Music is different from any art form in the world, because it has the unique power to take you back to a specific moment in your life. It's probably the closest thing we have to time travel, it allows you to re-live a memory or release the emotions surrounding that memory with unparalleled detail. You could be sitting in a restaurant, driving in your car and a particular song comes on and takes you to that exact time and place in your life like no book, movie or painting could ever do. I guess that's part of the reason why I gravitated to becoming a musician; it's what made me a fan of music and what made me wanna make music in the first place. I've had fans send me mail from all over the world telling me that my music had changed their lives, help them get off drugs, or helped them get through a death of a family member. You understand how important that is to me. That's definitely the best compliment you could get as a musician. That's why I make music. Everybody says this to the point where it's a cliché but the money is secondary. I make music to move people, to inspire people. That's what I was put here to do and that's what I'm gonna continue to do.| source =&ndash; Paz, on his main focus of making music in promotion for [[God of the Serengeti]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/Vinnie-paz-power-of-music-promo-lyrics |title=Vinnie Paz – Power of Music (Promo) Lyrics &#124; Genius Lyrics |website=Genius.com |access-date=2016-08-18}}</ref>}}

In 2011, Jedi Mind Tricks released their seventh studio album ''[[Violence Begets Violence]]''. It is the first JMT album without the production help of Stoupe, as Paz and Jus Allah grew tired of waiting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.16798/title.jedi-mind-tricks-address-stoupes-departure-citing-lost-passion|title=Jedi Mind Tricks Address Stoupe's Departure, Citing "Lost Passion"|author=HipHopDX|work=HipHopDX|date=September 20, 2011|access-date=November 15, 2014}}</ref> Paz stated; "By now you have heard that this is the first Jedi Mind Tricks album we've made without Stoupe handling the production. The bottom line is that at some point after making our last album, ''A History of Violence'', Stoupe lost his passion for making Hip Hop and wanted to try new things. Through our career, we've always waited on him to get inspired to make a new album, but this time around we got tired of waiting out his creative drought. He tried to produce some things for this new album, but we could tell early on that his heart wasn't in making JMT records anymore. He's moved on as a producer to work in other genres with his side-projects, Dutch and Vespertina, and we've moved on with a new crop of talented producers to make the hardcore Hip Hop we've always been known for."

Paz released his second studio album, ''[[God of the Serengeti]]'', on October 22, 2012. This effort followed up 2010's ''[[Season of the Assassin (album)|Season of the Assassin]]''. Nick Demolina (writer of ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]''), said "While Paz's raspy flow and violent imagery are generally coherent and amusing enough, there are a few head-scratchers sprinkled throughout. Such as, "I don't believe in crying at all/I'm a manic depressive—never get excited at all," and, "The bible is gone/you are watching a Viking perform," on "Cheesesteaks". While God of the Serengeti doesn't blaze any new ground, it is a release that will hold up to the Paz's legacy on the underground scene and will surely satisfy long-time fans."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/reviews/2012/10/vinnie-paz-god-of-the-serengti/|title=Vinnie Paz, God of the Serengeti Review XXL|access-date=August 13, 2012}}</ref>

Army of the Pharaohs released two albums in 2014: ''[[In Death Reborn]]'' on April 22, 2014, and ''[[Heavy Lies the Crown (Army of the Pharaohs album)|Heavy Lies the Crown]]'' on October 21, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/201373-Army-Of-The-Pharaohs |title=Army Of The Pharaohs Discography at Discogs |website=Discogs.com |access-date=August 18, 2016}}</ref>

==Themes and personal views==
Paz is known for his raw and gritty lyrical delivery. His lyrics frequently contain references to religion, war, politics, [[mythology]], [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], and the [[paranormal]]. His more recent albums such as ''Servants in Heaven, Kings in Hell'' show a more obvious approach to politics and world issues. This gritty style of Paz became apparent with the release of ''Violent by Design'', and has become progressively more defined since its release.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}Paz showed support towards [[Ron Paul]] during the [[2012 U.S. presidential election]], and has even referred to the former congressman in his lyrics.

Paz has a number of aliases, such as: "Ikon the Verbal Hologram", "Louie Doggs", "Boxcutter Pazzy", "Pack Pistol Pazzy", "Hologram", "Paz", "Vinnie P", "The Pazmanian Devil", Odrama Vin Laden", "Ikon the Python", and "Pazienza".{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Raised [[Catholic]], Paz is now a [[Muslim]], which plays a major role in much of his lyrics, often controversially, as on "[[Heavenly Divine]]", where he rapped "I'm with Allah 'cause he chose me, I broke into the Vatican, strangled The Pope with his rosary."<ref>Gloss, Jason. [http://www.philaflava.com/vinnie_paz.htm Philly should have been its own state]. Philaflava. Accessed June 13, 2008.</ref> Paz is also a [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] fan, and occasionally uses song titles and band names in JMT tracks and lyrics.
