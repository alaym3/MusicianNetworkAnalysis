'''Kerli Kõiv''' ({{IPA-et|ˈkerli ˈkɤ.iʋ|lang|Et-Kerli Kõiv.oga}}; born 7 February 1987), better known mononymously as '''Kerli''', is an Estonian singer and songwriter.

Born in [[Elva, Estonia|Elva]], Kerli entered multiple singing competitions before being signed to [[Island Records]] in 2006 by [[LA Reid]]. In 2007, she released her [[Kerli (EP)|debut self-titled extended play]] and in 2008, released her debut studio album, ''[[Love Is Dead (Kerli album)|Love Is Dead]]'', which charted on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The lead single from the album, "[[Walking on Air (Kerli song)|Walking on Air]]," charted in many countries and was also featured as the [[iTunes Store]]'s Single of the Week where it was downloaded over 500,000 times, a record at that time.<ref name="Paradigm">{{cite web|title=Kerli - A biography|url=http://www.paradigmagency.com/divisions/artist/index/2079|publisher=Paradigm Talent Agency|access-date=July 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424041628/http://www.paradigmagency.com/divisions/artist/index/2079|archive-date=2012-04-24|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the years following, Kerli was featured on ''[[Almost Alice]]'' with the song "[[Tea Party (song)|Tea Party]]" and she began to abandon her [[alternative rock]] sound and started to adopt a more [[electronic music|electronic]] and [[dance music|dance]]-influenced sound, as can be heard in her 2010 single "[[Army of Love]]".

Following the release of ''Love Is Dead'', Kerli began production on a second studio album which became her second [[extended play]] ''[[Utopia (EP)|Utopia]]'', released in early 2013, where it became Kerli's second release to chart on the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref name="billboard">{{cite magazine|title=Kerli Album & Song Chart History|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=kerli|chart=all}}|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=November 30, 2012}}</ref> Two promotional singles from the EP, "Army of Love" and "[[Zero Gravity (Kerli song)|Zero Gravity]]", were released prior to the release of the album's first official single, "[[The Lucky Ones (song)|The Lucky Ones]]". All three songs entered the top ten of ''Billboard{{'}}s'' [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] chart; two of them peaking at [[List of number-one dance hits (United States)|number one]]. Two songs which were co-written by Kerli for ''Utopia'' — "[[Skyscraper (song)|Skyscraper]]" and "[[I Feel Immortal]]" — were later recorded by artists [[Demi Lovato]] and [[Tarja Turunen]], respectively. Kerli's version of "I Feel Immortal" was later released on ''[[Frankenweenie (soundtrack)#Frankenweenie Unleashed!|Frankenweenie Unleashed!]]''.

In 2013, Kerli performed twice on ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 16)|Dancing with the Stars]]''; ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' called the performances a "major milestone in the [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] world."<ref>

== Career ==
=== 2002–2005: Career beginnings ===
In 2002, Kerli competed in the singing competition ''Laulukarussell'' in the age group category 13–15 and on May 18, won with the song "[[Bridge over Troubled Water (song)|Bridge over Troubled Water]]".<ref>{{cite web |title=2002 - History - Estonian Television - BBC |publisher=etv |year=2002 |url=http://etv.err.ee/index.php?0536429 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724051549/http://etv.err.ee/index.php?0536429 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 24, 2011 |access-date=October 3, 2010 }}</ref> Also in 2002, she falsified her age to enter the [[Baltic states|Baltic]] song contest ''Fizz Superstar'', as the minimum age was fifteen.

Kerli has stated, however, that she feels no resentment towards her home country.  In a 2008 interview she said the following:

{{cquote|''No, I don't feel any resentment [towards Estonia]. For a while, because I left Estonia and Estonians didn't hear anything about me so all these Estonian young singers were like...

After the release of ''Love Is Dead'', Kerli was labelled as "[[Gothic rock|goth]]" and a disagreeing critic said she was more along the lines of "[[Bubblegum pop|bubblegum]] goth." Kerli stated "that's exactly what I am" and that she was "going to take this concept and roll with it" and she created the derivative "BubbleGoth." Described by Kerli, BubbleGoth is "putting together light and dark, opposites, and things that you don't really necessarily think go together."<ref>{{cite web|title=Kerli Performs "Army Of Love"|url=http://www.cambio.com/shows/cambio-music/kerli-performs-army-of-love|publisher=Cambio|date=May 3, 2011|access-date=May 6, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529145245/http://www.cambio.com/|archive-date=May 29, 2012}}</ref> Kerli cites the [[Spice Girls]] as being a major influence on BubbleGoth, which she stated is "like a gothic spice girl".<ref>{{cite web|title=Buzznet Catches Up With Kerli as She Preps for Buzznet's SXSW show; BubbleGoth Goddess Cites the Spice Girls and Britney Spears as a Major Influence|url=http://wevegotyoucovered.buzznet.com/user/journal/7944261/buzznet-catches-up-kerli-preps/|author=We've Got You Covered|publisher=[[Buzznet]]|access-date=March 11, 2011|date=March 11, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321073529/http://wevegotyoucovered.buzznet.com/user/journal/7944261/buzznet-catches-up-kerli-preps/|archive-date=March 21, 2012}}</ref>

Kerli is fond of wearing various unique and colourful hairstyles, often inspired by [[cyberpunk]] and goth fashion.

The difference in musical style and composition in ''Love Is Dead'' compared to Kerli's further releases is significant. ''Love Is Dead'' being [[alternative rock]] and her current music being along the lines of [[synthpop]]. Kerli describes herself as being very depressed during the production of ''Love Is Dead'' and that she felt "scattered"<ref>{{cite web |title=hey kerli! i just wanted to know, what was different about when you where writing this album and your old one?... |url=http://www.formspring.me/bubblegoth/q/694579458 |author=Kerli |publisher=[[Formspring.me]] |access-date=September 28, 2011 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120802021657/http://www.formspring.me/bubblegoth/q/694579458 |archive-date=August 2, 2012 |url-status=dead }}<!--This is the only archived snapshot of the page. archive.org cannot access the page because of robots.txt.--></ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Okay.

== Personal life ==
[[File:Kerli at the 2011 South by Southwest 3 cropped.jpg|thumb|"Agnus Dei" tattooed on Kerli's arm]]
At the age of 15, Kerli asked her mother for a tattoo that read "music" in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] ("音乐"). Dubious, her mother told her that if she read "every book in town" on China and wrote a report on it, she would be allowed to get the tattoo. Kerli did as requested, and her mother took her to get the tattoo the day before her 16th birthday.<ref name="KiwiBoxYouTube2"/> She has two tattoos on her forearm; one is of a butterfly which symbolises "living every day like it was [her] last" and that she would never "leave a person that [she] loves without them knowing how much [she] loves them". The other tattoo states in Latin "Amicus Humani Generis", which Kerli translates "a friend of the human race". A tattoo on her left forearm, again in Latin, reads "[[Lamb of God|Agnus Dei]]".<ref name="KiwiBoxYouTube2"/> On her right foot, she has the letter "E", an initial of someone who "broke [her] heart".<ref name="BlairTattoos">{{cite web |last=Blair |first=Eric |title=KERLI talks Tattoos with Eric Blair 2008 |year=2008 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBhm2KyMkvA |publisher=[[YouTube]] |access-date=September 20, 2010}}</ref>
