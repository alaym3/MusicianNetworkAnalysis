'''Ileana Mercedes Cabra Joglar'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latintimes.com/ileana-cabra-calle-13-sister-announces-solo-project-singer-release-new-album-333081|title=Ileana Cabra, Calle 13 Sister, Announces Solo Project: Singer To Release New Album|first=Jessica Lucia|last=Roiz|date=August 5, 2015|website=Latin Times}}</ref> (born April 28, 1989), better known by the nickname "'''iLe'''", is a [[Puerto Rican Spanish|Puerto Rican]] singer, composer and vocalist. She began her musical career as a teenager as the sole female singer of [[Calle 13 (band)|Calle 13]], a group she took part in for 10 years alongside her brothers René Pérez Joglar ([[Residente]]) and Eduardo Cabra Martínez ([[Visitante]]).

Her first solo production, entitled ''iLevitable'' and launched in June 2016, won a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] in the category [[Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album|Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album]] in 2017, and for it iLe was also nominated for the [[Latin Grammy Award]]s as "Best New Artist".

iLe has performed in Puerto Rico, the United States and Europe.

== Background and artistic beginnings ==

iLe is the daughter of Flor Joglar de Gracia, an actress who formed part of the theatre troupe Teatro del Sesenta. Her father, José Cabra González is a creative advertiser and musician. Since a very young age, Ileana showed great interest in music.  She began to sing even while still learning how to speak, phonetically imitating the voices of famous singers or movie soundtracks that appealed to her. During this time she would often sing in private parties and family gatherings.

While attending Josefita Monserrate de Sellés elementary school, she joined the School Choir and the Handbell Choir headed by Evangeline Oliver. For eight years, she studied piano at El Conservatorio de Música de Puerto Rico.<ref name="rs">{{Cite web | author=Ecleen Luzmila Caraballo | website=[[Rolling Stone]] | title=Singer-Songwriter iLe Rallies for Puerto Rican Freedom - And Her Own - in Upcoming LP, 'Almadura'  | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-latin/ile-almadura-lp-2019-interview-824607/ | date=23 April 2019 | access-date=13 July 2020 }}</ref> Ileana inherited her voice from her mother and her grandmother, Flor Amelia de Gracia, teacher and composer, who is also featured on the back cover of Calle 13's [[Calle 13 (album)|self-titled debut album]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.primerahora.com/entretenimiento/farandula/nota/delutopormuertedesuabuelaelcantanteresidentecalle13-488727/ |title=De luto por muerte de su abuela el cantante Residente Calle 13 |publisher=Primerahora.com |access-date=April 12, 2017}}</ref> At age 16, as a second year high school student, her brother [[Residente]] picked her up one day after class and asked her to sing "La Aguacatona", a song he had written for a demo he was working on with her brother [[Visitante]]. She began to take private singing lessons with renowned Puerto Rican soprano Hilda Ramos and then additional vocal studies with Cuban singer [[Gema Corredera]], member of the group [[Gema y Pavel]].

== Calle 13 ==

=== Early years ===

From that point on, she began to collaborate as vocalist for her brothers' new musical project. "La Aguacatona"  caught the attention of [[White Lion Records]]. After recording a second song, "La Tribu", she was immediately nicknamed PG-13 by her cousin Ian Marcel Cardozo Joglar, since she was under-aged at the time she joined the group and [[Motion Picture Association film rating system|PG-13 is normally used to classify movies]] that require parental guidance for children under 13.

During 2005, she was active in the late-night circuit of shows and presentations in various venues throughout the island, which would help give form and structure to what was to become Calle 13. At only 16 years of age, she found herself singing on stage in front of thousands at the [[José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum|Coliseo de Puerto Rico José Miguel Agrelot]], as part of Calle 13's first concert. She chose to interpret "Puro Teatro", a song previously recorded by [[La Lupe]], which is one of her favorite artists.

On May 2, 2009, Calle 13 performed once again at the [[José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum|Coliseo de Puerto Rico José Miguel Agrelot]] for the release of their third album [[Los de Atrás Vienen Conmigo]]. "[[In The Heights]]" playwright [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]] was invited to make an appearance after [[Residente]] had seen his acceptance speech for [[Tony Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] at the [[62nd Tony Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/4462482 |title=Calle 13 & Lin Miranda – La Fucking Moda @ Calle 13 Concert in Puerto Rico on Vimeo |via=Vimeo |date=May 3, 2009 |access-date=April 12, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Visitante |first=Residente |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/calle13_oficial/3502774735 |title=LIn Manuel y Calle 13 en Coliseo Jose Miguel Agrelot |publisher=Flickr |date=May 3, 2009 |access-date=April 12, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eI6icWf6CB8 |title=Lin-Manuel Miranda Tony Acceptance Speech – In The Heights – YouTube |via=YouTube |date=June 16, 2008 |access-date=April 12, 2017}}</ref> Backstage, Flor Joglar de Gracia, mother of iLe and [[Residente]], revealed to Miranda their connection to [[Gilberto Concepción de Gracia]], founder of the [[Puerto Rican Independence Party]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Ayala |first=Leonor |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/lin-manuel-miranda-s-puerto-rican-town-crisis-worries-family-n565371 |title=In Lin-Manuel Miranda's Puerto Rican Town, Crisis Worries Family Members |publisher=NBC News |access-date=April 12, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://vanesabaerga.wordpress.com/2013/06/27/lin-manuel-miranda-a-paso-firme-en-las-alturas/ |title=A paso firme en las alturas {{pipe}} VANESA BAERGA |publisher=Vanesabaerga.wordpress.com |date=June 27, 2013 |access-date=April 12, 2017}}</ref> Miranda and [[Residente]] have since confirmed their family relation through social media.<ref>{{cite web|author=Lin-Manuel Miranda |url=https://twitter.com/lin_manuel/status/595335614427463680 |title=Lin-Manuel Miranda on Twitter: "Sometimes you run into your famous rapper cousin in the street." |publisher=Twitter |access-date=April 12, 2017}}{{Primary source inline|date=October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Lin-Manuel Miranda |url=https://twitter.com/lin_manuel/status/695110152106725376 |title=Lin-Manuel Miranda on Twitter: "The greatest rapper in the family came through tonight...@Residente aka mi primo RenĂŠ! #Asidegrandesonlasideas" |publisher=Twitter |access-date=April 12, 2017}}{{Primary source inline|date=October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://instagram.com/p/BBXtVLVLaB4/ |title=Instagram |publisher=Instagram |date=February 4, 2016 |access-date=April 12, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Lin-Manuel Miranda |url=https://twitter.com/lin_manuel/status/119507380508704768 |title=Lin-Manuel Miranda on Twitter: ".â€œ@belisa78: @Lin_Manuel are u and Rene from Calle 13 really primos or did u mean it like brother or buddy?i MUST know!â€? 3rd cousins." |publisher=Twitter |access-date=April 12, 2017}}{{Primary source inline|date=October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Lin-Manuel Miranda |url=https://twitter.com/lin_manuel/status/758489202522718208 |title=Lin-Manuel Miranda on Twitter|publisher=Twitter |date=July 27, 2016 |access-date=April 12, 2017}}{{Primary source inline|date=October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://instagram.com/p/BIY9DVRj5AE/ |title=Instagram |publisher=Instagram |date=July 28, 2016 |access-date=April 12, 2017}}</ref>

PG-13 continued traveling with Calle 13 during her junior year of high school. At that time, she had the opportunity to visit other countries and share the stage with some of her most admired artists, such as [[Gustavo Santaolalla]], [[Kevin Johansen]] and [[Susana Baca]].

=== Latin Grammy Awards performances ===

When she was 18, PG-13 sang at the [[8th Annual Latin Grammy Awards]] presentation held at the [[Mandalay Bay]] in Las Vegas, as part of Calle 13's interpretation of  "Pa'l Norte" which opened with PG-13 performing a solo ''[[a cappella]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Video Interpretación Calle 13/Orishas-Pal Morte|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wGRp20_KRc|via=YouTube}}</ref>

In November 2011, Calle 13 opened the Gala at the 12th edition of the Latin Grammy Awards with the theme "Latinoamérica" performed with a symphony orchestra arrangement by Alex Berti and conducted by Musical Director Gustavo Dudamel. According to Latino Fox News, PG-13's high notes left everyone in silence.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Greatereaux|first1=Alexandra|title=Calle 13 Sweep Breaks Records at the Latin GRAMMYs|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/entertainment/2011/11/11/latin-grammys-calle-13-makes-history/}}</ref>

== Solo career ==

=== First steps ===

By the end of 2012 she participated in the traditional [[Banco Popular]] TV Christmas Special which has been produced and transmitted each year since 1993.  On this occasion, for the special "Hecho con Sabor a Puerto Rico" Ileana had an impressive performance singing "La Pared"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyA3rtWTioI|title=ILEANA CABRA – LA PARED|date=December 2, 2012|via=YouTube}}</ref> which was described by the Diario of NY as "superb" 4 La Pared is one of the first successful songs written by Puerto Rican composer [[Roberto Angleró]].

=== Collaborations ===

In 2010 Kevin Johansen invited Joglar as a guest performer during his presentation at the Buenos Aires National Theatre where together they sang "Logo,"  a song included in Johansen's repertoire and recording; The Nada Liniers: Live in Buenos Aires.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kevin Johansen + The Nada + Liniers – Vivo en Buenos Aires|url=https://www.rollingstone.com.ar/1263561|access-date=December 3, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224205534/http://www.rollingstone.com.ar/1263561|archive-date=December 24, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2012, boxing champion [[Miguel Cotto]] chose Joglar to sing the [[La Borinquena|Puerto Rican National Anthem]] during the introduction ceremony prior to his fight against [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]]. Her interpretation was widely acclaimed, including by the legendary [[Bob Dylan]], who in 2015 mentioned her in his [[MusiCares Person of the Year]] speech: "I was in a boxing match a few years ago watching Floyd Mayweather fight a boxer from Puerto Rico and someone sang the Puerto Rican national anthem. And it was beautiful, it was heartfelt, it was moving".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=Randall|title=Grammys 2015: Transcript of Bob Dylan's MusiCares Person of Year speech|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-grammys-2015-transcript-of-bob-dylans-musicares-person-of-year-speech-20150207-story.html|access-date=October 13, 2015}}</ref>

In 2014 she collaborated with Gustavo Cordera on the theme "Estoy Real" for the "Cordera Vivo" production, which was recorded at La Trastienda Club in Buenos Aires, Argentina. One year later, in 2015, she was invited by Jorge Drexler to sing on stage the song "Olas y Arena" by Puerto Rican composer Sylvia Rexach during Drexler's concert in Puerto Rico as part of the Uruguayan singer's tour.

In 2017, she guest sang on "Hijos del Canãveral", the closing track of her brother's [[Residente (album)|debut solo album]].<ref name="efe31">{{cite web|last1=Ortiz|first1=Jorge J.

=== ''iLevitable'' ===

In May 2016, ''iLevitable'' was released to the praise of critic and peers. According to [[NPR]] "the album established her immediately as a first-class interpreter of the classic sounds that flow through Latin America."<ref>{{cite web|author=ET |url=https://www.npr.org/2016/05/20/478667340/first-listen-ile-ilevitable |title=Review: iLe, 'iLevitable' |publisher=NPR |date=May 20, 2016 |access-date=April 12, 2017}}</ref> [[Jon Pareles]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described it as "a knowingly retro survey of Latin music's past, full of romance and a longing that can turn despondent. She sings richly orchestrated boleros, delicate ballads and percussive boogaloo and mambo, without a hint of either irony or naïveté."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/02/arts/music/ile-ilevitable-review.html|title=Review: iLe's 'iLevitable' Finds That Longing Can Turn to Mourning|first=Jon|last=Pareles|date=June 1, 2016|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

Some of Puerto Rico's most prominent musicians collaborated on the album: [[Piro Rodríguez]], [[Charlie Sepulveda]], [[Bayrex Jiménez]], [[Eduardo Cabra]], Fofé Abreu from [[Circo (band)|Circo]], Louis García and the late [[Cheo Feliciano]] in one of his last recordings ever.

The first single released was "Caníbal" and it was accompanied by a dramatic video directed by Argentinian Juan Manuel Costa.

In February 2017, ''iLevitable'' won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album|Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album]].

=== ''Almadura'' ===

On May 20, 2019, iLe released her sophomore album, ''Almadura'', a title that literally translates to "strong soul" and is a play on words of the Spanish word for "armor" ("armadura").<ref name="wlrn">{{Cite news | title=Puerto Rican Singer iLe Brings Almadura's Seductive, Revolutionary Rhythms To North Beach | website=WLRN.org | publisher=Artburst Miami |author=Helena Alonso Paisley  | date=19 February 2020 | url=https://www.wlrn.org/post/puerto-rican-singer-ile-brings-almadura-s-seductive-revolutionary-rhythms-north-beach | access-date=13 July 2020 }}</ref> The album contains modern and electronic takes on Puerto Rican and other Caribbean musical styles and folklore, referencing traditional musical genres like bomba and featuring artists like jazz and salsa pianist [[Eddie Palmieri]].<ref name="rs" /><ref name="wlrn" />

''Almadura'' not only reflects on Puerto Rico's cultural roots, but on its present and future, as well, notably in the wake of [[Hurricane Maria]].<ref name="rs" /><ref name="wlrn" /> The video for the lead single, "Odio," reenacts the [[Cerro Maravilla murders]] as a message of empowerment and solidarity in response to the aftermath of the storm.<ref name="rs" /><ref name="rs2">{{Cite web | author=Isabela Raygoza  | website=[[Rolling Stone]] | title=iLe Sheds Light on Puerto Rico's Forgotten History in New Video for 'Odio'  | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-latin/ile-puerto-rico-new-video-premiere-odio-710977/ | date=15 August 2018 | access-date=13 July 2020 }}</ref>

In a year-end essay for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', [[Ann Powers]] cited ''Almadura'' as proof that [[Album era#2000s: Decline in the digital age, shift to pop and urban|the format is not dead]] but rather undergoing a "metamorphosis", with artists such as iLe utilizing the [[concept album]] through the culturally-relevant autobiographical narratives.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Powers|first=Ann|author-link=Ann Powers|date=December 17, 2019|url=https://slate.com/culture/2019/12/music-club-2019-concept-albums-not-dead.html|title=The album is evolving.|magazine=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|access-date=September 15, 2020}}</ref>
