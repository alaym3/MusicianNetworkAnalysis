During their existence, the band released two studio albums, one compilation of early recordings, one live recording, three 7" singles and appeared on various compilations. The band also recorded on a few independent labels, and released its two studio albums on [[C/Z Records]]. In 2003, each release in the band's discography was remastered and expanded with bonus tracks on Broken Rekids.

==History==

===Formation and early history===
The Gits met and formed in 1986 at [[Antioch College]], a [[liberal arts]] school in Yellow Springs, Ohio.<ref name="MacDonald" /> They called themselves the 'Snivelling Little Rat Faced Gits' (a reference to a [[Monty Python]] skit), but soon shortened the moniker to just 'The Gits'.<ref name="Johnson" /> In 1988 they recorded and self-released their "unofficial" debut album entitled ''Private Lubs'' with the help of friend Ben London (later of [[Alcohol Funnycar]] and solo). These recordings did not see widespread release until 1996, when the album was reissued by the Broken Rekids label as ''[[Kings & Queens (The Gits album)|Kings & Queens]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Masuo|first=Sandy|title=Gits / Kings & Queens / Broken|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PC0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA38&dq=%22mia+zapata%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=DGmnT5SgMuLd6QGV_YGgBA&ved=0CFUQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&q=%22mia%20zapata%22&f=false|accessdate=7 May 2012|newspaper=[[CMJ New Music Monthly]]|page=38|date=December 1996}}</ref><ref name="Allmusic entry">{{cite web|title=Kings & Queens – The Gits|url=http://allmusic.com/album/kings--queens-r267646|work=Allmusic|accessdate=7 May 2012}}</ref>

After relocating to [[Seattle, Washington]] in 1989, the band set up shop at "the Rathouse", an abandoned house in the [[Capitol Hill, Seattle, Washington|Capitol Hill]] district where they rehearsed and lived.<ref name="MacDonald">MacDonald, Patrick (2005) "[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2002288805_rocksiff26.html "The Gits" explores punk family and tragic fate of Seattle rocker]", ''[[The Seattle Times]]'', May 26, 2005, retrieved 2012-05-07</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Yarm|first=Mark|title=Everybody Loves Our Town: An Oral History of Grunge|publisher=Random House|isbn=9780307464446|pages=567|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z-44p7V2TrUC&pg=PA322&dq=%22mia+zapata%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dXKnT43sCe6N6QHGyYXPBA&ved=0CFIQ6AEwBDgo#v=onepage&q=%22mia%20zapata%22&f=false|accessdate=7 May 2012|date=13 March 2012}}</ref>  They quickly earned a following in the local scene and gained many friends, particularly in the city's punk rock community. During the early 1990s, buzz began surrounding the band, which caused some media outlets to erroneously lump them in with the then-burgeoning Seattle [[grunge music]] scene, and Zapata's persona led many{{who|date=April 2012}} to incorrectly associate The Gits with the [[Olympia, Washington]] [[riot grrrl|riot grrrl movement]].{{opinion|date=April 2012}}

The band's first official release was "Precious Blood", released by the local Big Flaming Ego Records. This single was quickly followed up by two more releases ("[[Second Skin (song)|Second Skin]]" on Broken Rekids (1991), "[[Spear & Magic Helmet]]" on Empty Records (1991), as well as the ''Bobbing For Pavement'' compilation (Rathouse/Broken Rekids, 1991).

In 1992 the band recorded and released their debut album, ''[[Frenching the Bully]]''.<ref name="Jeffries" />

==Murder of Mia Zapata==
On the night of July 7, 1993, Mia Zapata was brutally raped and murdered while walking home from a bar, The Comet.<ref name="Jeffries" /> The [[Seattle Police Department]] initially focused their investigation on Zapata's circle of friends, believing that her murderer must have been someone she knew. Using funds generated by the Seattle music community (from benefit shows and CDs), as well as their own money, the remaining band members hired private investigator Leigh Hearon to supplement the police department's investigation. For over three years, Hearon and the Seattle Police Department investigated the crime with few or no breaks in the case. In 1996, the investigation first gained national attention in an episode of ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]''. It however did not open any new leads. The case was later highlighted on several other TV shows including [[A&E Network|A&E's]] ''[[American Justice]]'', ''[[Cold Case Files]]'', ''[[City Confidential]]'', [[CBS]]'s ''[[48 Hours (TV series)|48 Hours]]'', [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX's]] ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'', and [[TruTV]]'s ''[[Forensic Files]]''.

Nine years passed with few new leads in the case, until a random [[DNA]] check conducted by the Seattle PD's Cold Case Unit and the Washington State Crime Lab led to the arrest of Jesus Mezquia. Mezquia, who briefly lived in Seattle during the time of Zapata's murder, was linked to the crime in 2003 when a DNA profile was extracted from a saliva sample left on Zapata's body;<ref name="Johnson">Johnson, Gene (2003) "[https://web.archive.org/web/20141011101119/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-9581110.html Florida Man Held for '93 Slaying of Punk Singer – Mia Zapata of The Gits was strangled in July 1993]", ''[[Yakima Herald-Republic]]'', January 12, 2003, retrieved 2012-05-07 via [[Highbeam Research]] {{Subscription required}}</ref> Mezquia had bitten her breast. The saliva sample had been kept in cold storage until the [[Short tandem repeat|STR]] technology was developed for full extraction. An original entry in 2001 failed to generate a positive result, but Mezquia's DNA entered the national data bank after he was arrested for burglary in Florida in 2002.

On March 25, 2004, a jury convicted Mezquia of Zapata's murder and he was later sentenced to 36 years in prison, the maximum allowed in the case under Washington state law.<ref name="JohnsonT">Johnson, Tracy (2004) "[https://archive.today/20130125064216/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-116137374.html Singer's Killer Gets 37 Years: Mia Zapata's Friends Fill Courtroom for Sentencing of Jesus Mezquia]", ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'', May 1, 2004, retrieved 2012-05-07 via [[Highbeam Research]] {{Subscription required}}</ref>

Mezquia died on January 21st, 2021.

==Legacy==

===Home Alive===
In the aftermath of Zapata's murder, friends created a [[non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[self-defense]] group called [[Home Alive]], which ceased operations in 2010, organized [[benefit concert]]s and CDs with the participation of several bands, including [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Heart (band)|Heart]], and the [[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|Presidents of the United States of America]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Breihan|first=Tom|title=Mia Zapata's Killer Sentenced for Good, Finally|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/34514-mia-zapatas-killer-sentenced-for-good-finally/|work=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]|accessdate=7 May 2012|date=2 February 2009}}</ref> The Home Alive group has its own instructors and seek to empower women with ways to protect themselves against predators.

===Dedications===
[[Portland, Oregon]]-based [[alternative rock]] band [[Everclear (band)|Everclear]] dedicated their 1993 album ''[[World of Noise]]'' to Zapata. The [[California]] [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]] band Retching Red included a Gits cover ("Spear and Magic Helmet") on their debut album ''Get Your Red Wings''. Also, the [[alt-country]] band [[Richmond Fontaine]] have a [[tribute]] song to the band, called "The Gits".

Punk rock band [[7 Year Bitch]], who were good friends and briefly label mates of The Gits, named their 1994 album ''[[¡Viva Zapata!]]'' in tribute to Mia Zapata. The album cover also featured a painting by artist Scott Musgrove featuring Zapata wearing bullet sashes. The song "M.I.A.", which explicitly deals with Zapata's death, appears on this album.

===Films===
In 1996, ''[[Hype!]]''—a documentary about the [[Seattle Sound|Seattle scene]], featuring The Gits—came out. Nine years later, in 2005, a movie chronicling the life of Mia Zapata during her time with The Gits was released. The final cut of the film was released theatrically in over 20 North American cities on July 7, 2008, the 15th memorial anniversary of Zapata's death. The following day saw the film released on DVD along with a ''Best of the Gits'' CD (both from Liberation Entertainment).

The story of the Gits was made into a "lively and engaging" documentary film,<ref name="Seattle Times documentary review">{{cite news|last=Fry|first=Ted|title=Mia Zapata, the Gits get their due in fan's documentary|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/movies/2008026219_gits01.html|accessdate=7 May 2012|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|year=2008}}</ref> titled simply ''The Gits'', and reflected a renewed interest in the band.<ref name="EW 2003: renewed interest">{{cite news|last=Sinclair|first=Tom|title=Viva Zapata|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,467437,00.html|accessdate=7 May 2012|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=1 August 2003}}</ref> The film, directed by Kerri O'Kane, had its first screenings in 2005 at the [[Seattle International Film Festival]].<ref name="MacDonald" /> A finalized version of the film was accepted and screened at the 2007 [[SXSW Film Festival|SXSW (South By Southwest) Film Festival]] held March 9–17, 2007, in [[Austin, Texas]]. In her review for [[NPR]], Sarah Bardeen found that "Above all, we fall for the music. Compared to many of their contemporaries, the Gits were instrumentally brilliant, playing fast, tight, classic punk rock which took a radical left turn when Zapata added her voice to the mix".<ref name="NPR documentary review">{{cite web|last=Bardeen|first=Sarah|title=The Gits' Mia Zapata Resurrected In Film|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94322927|work=[[NPR]]|accessdate=7 May 2012|date=5 September 2008}}</ref>

==Related projects==
Following the posthumous completion of ''[[Enter: The Conquering Chicken]]'', Spleen formed a hardcore punk band called the Dancing French Liberals of '48, and later toured briefly with hardcore legends [[Poison Idea]].<ref name="Jeffries" /><ref name="Woodlief">Woodlief, Mark & Robbins, Ira "[http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=gits Gits]", ''[[Trouser Press]]'', retrieved 2012-05-07</ref> Dancing French Liberals of '48 featured all of the remaining Gits as well as longtime friend and guitarist Julian Gibson (ex-DC Beggars). Their music was, as expected, much in the vein of the Gits although with a more [[hardcore punk]] attitude. Together the Liberals issued an EP (''Scream Clown Scream'') and a full-length album (''Powerline'') on the Broken Rekids label before disbanding in the late 1990s.

Following Zapata's death, [[Joan Jett]] and [[Bikini Kill]] frontwoman [[Kathleen Hanna]] co-wrote a song (entitled "Go Home") inspired by Zapata's death. Jett also included a message at the end of her video for the song asking for any information anyone had in regard to Zapata's murder. After seeing the video the remaining members of the Gits approached Jett about touring with the band. Jett agreed as she had long been a fan of The Gits. The band renamed themselves [[Evil Stig]] (''Gits Live'' backwards), and toured in early 1995 playing a mix of Gits and Joan Jett songs, with a majority of the profits going towards Zapata's murder investigation.<ref name="Jeffries" /> A self-titled album was issued later in the year, again with a majority of the profits going towards the investigation.<ref>{{cite news|last=Stewart|first=Allison|title=Evil Stig Evil Stig|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Li0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT8&dq=%22mia+zapata%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=DGmnT5SgMuLd6QGV_YGgBA&ved=0CFkQ6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&q=%22mia%20zapata%22&f=false|accessdate=7 May 2012|newspaper=[[CMJ New Music Monthly]]|page=32|date=October 1995}}</ref><ref name="Marsh">Marsh, Steven P.
