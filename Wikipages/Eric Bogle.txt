'''Eric Bogle''' (born 23 September 1944) is a Scottish [[folk music|folk]] singer-songwriter. Born and raised in Scotland, he emigrated to Australia at the age of 25, to settle near [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]. Bogle's songs have covered a variety of topics, and have been performed by many artists. Two of his best known songs are "[[No Man's Land (Eric Bogle song)|No Man's Land]]" (or "The Green Fields of France") and "[[And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda]]", with the latter named one of the [[APRA Top 30 Australian songs]] in 2001, as part of the celebrations for the [[Australasian Performing Right Association]]'s 75th anniversary.

==Early years==
Eric Bogle was born on 23 September 1944 in [[Peebles]], Scotland. His father was a railway signalman who played the [[Great Highland Bagpipe|bagpipes]].<ref name="Haliday"/><ref name="MABio"/> Bogle started writing poetry when he was eight years old.<ref name="MABio"/> After attending school until he was sixteen, Bogle worked in various trades: labourer, clerk and barman.<ref name="MABio"/> In 1969, Bogle emigrated to Australia and initially lived in the capital, [[Canberra]], where he worked as an accountant.<ref name="Haliday"/> He had an interest in politics and by 1980 had moved to Queensland before settling in Adelaide.<ref name="Haliday"/>

== Career ==
[[File:Eric Bogle at Georgetown Folk Festival 1994.jpg|thumb|Bogle on stage at the 1994 Tamar Valley Folk Festival, [[George Town, Tasmania|George Town]], Australia]]
Bogle taught himself to play guitar and joined a [[skiffle]] and rock band.<ref name="MABio"/> He was the leader of Eric and the Informers in Scotland.<ref name="Haliday"/> His early influences were [[Lonnie Donegan]], [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Ewan MacColl]].<ref name="MABio"/> He turned to folk music prior to emigrating to Australia – his first written songs concerned his parents. One of these, "Leaving Nancy", which sang of the day he left home for Australia, being the last time he saw his mother Nancy, was often covered, most notably by [[The Dubliners]] and [[The Fureys]].<ref name="Haliday"/> When living in Canberra he joined the local folk music scene and performed occasionally.<ref name="MABio"/>

Several of his most famous songs tell of the futility or loss of war. Prominent among these is "[[And The Band Played Waltzing Matilda]]", written in 1971. The lyrics recount the experiences of a member of the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] (ANZAC) in the [[Battle of Gallipoli]]. It has also been interpreted as a reaction to the [[Vietnam War]].

Another of his best-known songs, "[[No Man's Land (Eric Bogle song)|No Man's Land]]", is also World War I-themed. This song is commonly known as "The Green Fields of France", a title it was first given by [[The Fureys]], and which has subsequently been used in many further [[cover version]]s. The song refers to the traditional Scottish song "[[Flowers of the Forest]]" being played over the grave of a [[World War I]] soldier. Bogle deliberately gave the dead soldier an Irish name ("Willie McBride") as a counter to the anti-Irish sentiment prevalent in Britain during the 1970s. This song has been covered by [[Alex Beaton]] (with "A Scottish Soldier" from ''The Water is Wide''), [[Plethyn]] ("Gwaed ar eu Dwylo" (Blood on their Hands), sung in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] from "Blas y Pridd"), and [[Hannes Wader]] ("Es ist an der Zeit" (It is the Time)). American folk singer [[Charlie Zahm]] also has a version on his album ''Festival Favorites'', as does American Folk Singer Robert Marr on his 2011 album ''Celticism''. The lyrics from the song were referred to former British Prime Minister Tony Blair in 2003 as his favorite anti-war poem.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/music/and-the-band-plays-on-20030224-gdv9wt.html|title=And the band plays on . . .|date=24 February 2003|newspaper=[[The Age]]}}</ref>

"As if he Knows" (2001) widens the theme of the wastage of war to describe the sadness of Australian mounted soldiers in Palestine in 1918 as they are obliged to shoot their horses, "who asked so little and gave so much", before embarkation.

Another notable song on a similar theme, but with a more contemporary setting, is the [[The Troubles|Troubles]]-inspired "My Youngest Son Came Home Today", with its tale of a young man killed during fighting in [[Northern Ireland]]. Notably, the song does not take sides in the conflict; it does not mention whether the title character is a nationalist or loyalist. However, the song has been adopted by Nationalists and is now associated with Irish Republicanism. When [[Billy Bragg]] covered the song, he changed the line "dreams of ''freedom'' unfulfilled" (which echoes the language of Nationalists) to "dreams of ''glory'' unfulfilled". Memorable gigs can be recalled by fellow artists such as Fran Malone who played with Eric in An Rinn in the 1990s.

Bogle's songs cover a wide range of subjects and themes, including comedic songs ("The Aussie [[Barbecue|Bar-B-Q]]"), satires ("I Hate Wogs"), [[protest song]]s and serious songs about the human condition such as "Now I'm Easy". His song "Safe in the Harbour" is an homage to [[Stan Rogers]]. "Katie and the Dreamtime Land" is a tribute to American folk singer [[Kate Wolf]], who died from [[leukemia]] in 1986. Other well-known songs, with lighter subject matter, include two homages to departed pets, "Little Gomez" and "Nobody's Moggy Now" and an acknowledgment of his folk music fans with "Do You Sing Any Dylan?".

In 2000 a five-CD collection, ''Singing The Spirit Home,'' was released. His first and only live performance DVD was released in May 2009.

==Touring==
[[File:Eric Bogle-John Munro 2009.jpg|thumb|Bogle (left) with [[John Campbell Munro|John Munro]] in Watford during their 2009 farewell tour.]]
Bogle has undertaken an extensive concert tour of the UK (sometimes including appearances in continental Europe as well), every three years since 1985. These tours have usually included a supporting cast of Australian-based singers and musicians, most regularly [[John Campbell Munro|John Munro]] and [[Brent Miller (Musician)|Brent Miller]]. Bogle said that his 2009 tour, with John Munro, would be his last overseas tour. This featured a ''Saturday Night Special'' on 27 June with Martyn Wyndham-Read, Johnny Collins and Les Sullivan in [[Watford]], the closest venue to London.

More recent tours in Australia have included Adelaide-based musicians Emma Luker (fiddle) and Pete Titchener (guitar/bass)

Bogle was a prominent artist at the [[National Folk Festival (Australia)|National Folk Festival]] in Canberra over Easter 2011, has been a regular artist at the [[Port Fairy Folk Festival]] held in [[Port Fairy]], Victoria, Australia every March.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.folkfestival.asn.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/friday.pdf|title=Program|website=Folkfestival.asn.au|access-date=11 November 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726071822/http://www.folkfestival.asn.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/friday.pdf|archive-date=26 July 2011}}</ref>

==Tributes==
On 25 January 1987, Eric Bogle was appointed a [[Order of Australia|Member of the Order of Australia]], "In recognition of service to the performing arts as a song writer and singer".<ref name="Order"/>

Many of Bogle's songs have been covered by other artists; including [[John Schumann]], [[The Skids]], [[June Tabor]], [[The Men They Couldn't Hang]], [[The Clancy Brothers]], [[The Dubliners]], [[John McDermott (singer)|John McDermott]], [[Liam Clancy]], [[Mike Harding]], [[The Pogues]], [[De Dannan]], [[Dropkick Murphys]], [[The Corries]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[The Bushwackers (band)|The Bushwackers]], [[Slim Dusty]], [[Mary Black]], [[The Fureys]] and [[John Williamson (singer)|John Williamson]]. In May 2001 the [[Australasian Performing Right Association|Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA)]], as part of its 75th Anniversary celebrations, named his song, "[[And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda]]", as one of the [[APRA Top 30 Australian songs|Top 30 Australian songs]] of all time.<ref name="Kruger"/>
