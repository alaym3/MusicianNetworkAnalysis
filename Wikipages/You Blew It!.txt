'''You Blew It!''' was an American [[emo]] quintet based in [[Orlando, Florida]]. The band was formed in 2009 by Tanner Jones, Timothy Flynn, and Matt Messore. 

==History==
In 2012, the band released their debut LP, ''[[Grow Up, Dude]]'' under [[Topshelf Records]]. Prior to their LP, the band released two EPs: ''EP'' in 2009 and ''The Past in the Present'' in 2010.<ref name=bio>{{cite web|last1=Heaney|first1=Gregory|title=You Blew It! - Biography|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/5878257/you-blew-it/biography|website=Rovi|publisher=Billboard.com|access-date=23 November 2014}}</ref>

Following ''Grow Up, Dude'' the band released a split EP in 2013 entitled ''Florida Doesn't Suck'' with fellow Floridian band [[Fake Problems]]. Their 2014 LP, ''[[Keep Doing What You're Doing]]'', achieved the most commercial success of any of their albums, charting in the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], the ''Billboard'' [[Top Heatseekers]] and the [[Independent Albums]] charts. Later that same year, the band released a cover EP, entitled ''You Blue It'', which features covers from [[Weezer]]'s 1994 album, ''[[Weezer (1994 album)|The Blue Album]]''. The most recent work by the band was a twelve-track LP entitled ''[[Abendrot (album)|Abentrot]]'' which came out on November 11, 2016.

On October 9, 2017, the band announced their final two shows "for the foreseeable future." The band briefly reunited in August of 2018 to play three shows in Florida with the emo band, [[American Football (band)|American Football]], stating that "passing on the opportunity to play with them would forever rest in the back of our minds," via their Instagram. <ref>{{Cite web|last=Instagram|first=You Blew It!|title=Login â€¢ Instagram|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BiMqG7Hh-5H/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link|url-status=live|access-date=2021-07-25|website=www.instagram.com}}</ref> Since then, You Blew It! has not released any new material or played any live shows as a band.
