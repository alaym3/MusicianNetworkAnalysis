'''Zoot Woman''' is a British [[electronic music]] group consisting of [[Adam Blake (musician)|Adam Blake]], [[Johnny Blake]] and [[Stuart Price]].

Their debut studio album ''[[Living in A Magazine]]'' was released by [[Wall of Sound (record label)|Wall of Sound]] backed by singles "It's Automatic" and "Living In A Magazine". Their second eponymous album features the singles "Grey Day" and "Taken It All".

Zoot Woman songs have been remixed by [[Todd Edwards]], [[Le Knight Club]] featuring [[Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo]] of [[Daft Punk]], [[Adam Port]], [[Michael Mayer (musician)|Michael Mayer]], [[Ben Böhmer]], [[Boris Dlugosch]], [[Ninetoes]], [[Chopstick & Johnjon]].

Price and Adam Blake also remix under the alias [[Paper Faces]], as well as individually and have reworked tracks for Zoot Woman and established recording artists such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Scissor Sisters]], [[Armand Van Helden]], and [[Chromeo]]. 

==History==
=== ''Living in a Magazine'' (2001) ===
With the release of the conceptual debut album ''[[Living in A Magazine]]'' in 2001, Zoot Woman established themselves on the music scene, releasing the singles "It's Automatic" and "Living in a Magazine". The album's pop sensibility is evident on tracks such as "Jessie", "Holiday Home" and "Information First". [[Simon Price]] of ''[[The Independent]]'' wrote, "This is the sound of minor-key heartbreak in departure lounges and penthouse suites, an album which should come with "New York, London, Paris, Munich" embossed on the sleeve."{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Their track "It's Automatic" has been sampled by several [[Hip hop music]] artists, including [[JD Era]], while possibly the most well-known cover of "It's Automatic" is by [[Mickey Factz]] featuring Curtis Santiago, due to its use in an online car commercial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rhymesandreasons.honda.com/story/episode4/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412195441/http://rhymesandreasons.honda.com/story/episode4/ |archive-date=12 April 2010 }}</ref>

===''Zoot Woman'' (2003)===
A significant departure from the bright, pop feel of ''Living in A Magazine'', Zoot Woman's eponymous second album remains faithful to the musical qualities that made their debut record. ''[[Zoot Woman (album)|Zoot Woman]]'' features the singles "Grey Day" and "Taken It All". "Gem" from this album was used in the [[Kate Moss]]/[[Rimmel]] Cosmetics TV advertising campaign and "Calmer" appears in an episode of the [[CBS]] TV drama ''[[CSI (franchise)|CSI]]''.

The song "Hope in the Mirror" was featured in the soundtrack to [[Mack Dawg Productions]] 2004 snowboard video ''Chulksmack'', in the [[Jussi Oksanen]] section of the film. Their track "Grey Day" appeared in [[David Benedek]]'s film ''91 Words for Snow'' (2006, Blank Paper Studio). This helped spread the word to the snowboard community.

===''Things Are What They Used to Be'' (2009)===

In December 2007, a new single titled "[[We Won't Break (song)|We Won't Break]]" was released as a free download on [[RCRD LBL]]. The single was accompanied by a music video directed by Mirjam Baker and Michael Kren. In March 2008, the band made a second single ("Live in My Head") available for download on their MySpace page. Both songs are featured on their third album, ''[[Things Are What They Used to Be]]'', which was released on 21 August 2009 by Zoot Woman's own record label, [[Zoot Woman (Zoot Woman Records)|ZWR]]. Other singles include "Just a Friend of Mine", "More Than Ever", "[[Memory (Cats song)|Memory]]", and "Live in My Head".

Well received by critics; ''[[NME]]'' rated the album 8/10 with [[Camilla Pia]] writing, "The electro-clash survivors are at their most impressive yet: combining rip-your-heart-out lyrics with instantly singable melodies and frosty synths, all tinged with the occasional flurry of string and disco riffs. This is a masterclass in modern electronic music, finessed by innovation and emotional depth."

''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s [[Dave Simpson (journalist)|Dave Simpson]] wrote, "'More Than Ever' wraps undying love up in big keyboard stabs, 'Witness' is an effective moody stomp, and 'Lonely By Your Side' – a personal/existential crisis in a three-minute pop song – can hold its head up among their heroes.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/sep/11/zoot-woman-things-are-what-they-used-to-be-review | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Dave | last=Simpson | title=Zoot Woman: Things Are What They Used to Be | date=11 September 2009}}</ref>"

===''Star Climbing'' (2014)===
[[File:Johnny Blake Live In 2015.jpg|thumb|alt=Johnny Blake stands in front of a microphone while holding a guitar|Johnny Blake Live In 2015]]
On 1 January 2013, the band announced on Facebook and Twitter that they look forward to introducing and touring the new album ''[[Star Climbing (album)|Star Climbing]]''. On 11 December 2013, Zoot Woman's new single, "The Stars Are Bright" was made available on [[iTunes]], nearly one year after the initial album announcement.

Other singles from ''Star Climbing'' include the song "Don't Tear Yourself Apart". The latter is described by critics as "a ravishing melody paired with the unmistakable vocals of Johnny Blake."{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} It was recorded in a similar way to "It's Automatic", minimal music, simple song, written on an old [[Casio]] synthesizer and [[Roland TR-909]] drum machine.

[[Stuart Price]] said in a statement, "We recorded ''Star Climbing'' over a three-year period between our studios, working on songs and lyrics until we felt like we had found the albums direction. It is our most distinctive album to date, combining all our different tastes and styles into one."

===''Absence'' (2017)===
[[File:Zoot Woman at a promotional photo shoot in 2017.jpg|thumb|alt=Two members of Zoot Woman stand amidst white panels, surrounded by camera equipment. A third man, on his knees, tilts his head looking toward the Zoot Woman members|200px|left|Zoot Woman at a promotional photo session in 2017]]
In 2016 Zoot Woman started a social media campaign uploading short segments of 'songs in the making' that would eventually become the album [[Absence (Zoot Woman album)|Absence]]. Titles include ‘Haunt Me’, ‘Ordinary Face’ and ‘I Said It Again’. [[Absence (Zoot Woman album)|Absence]] is the band’s fifth album, and would appear to be the first to feature any collaborative songs. [[Kylie Minogue]] will feature on the track 'Still Feels Like The First Time'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/zootwomanteam/videos/another-snippet-from-the-new-zoot-woman-album-absence-out-1/10155504039529749/|title=Another snippet from the new Zoot Woman album 'Absence', out 1...|website=Facebook.com|access-date=2020-06-22}}</ref> The album release date listed on Zoot Woman Instagram and in the media: June 16th 2017. Released on [[Zoot Woman (Zoot Woman Records)|ZWR]] worldwide under licence to Snowhite Records, who are based in Berlin, Germany.

===''Redesigned'' (2018)===
At the end of 2017, Zoot Woman announced plans for the production of ''[[Redesigned (Zoot Woman album)|Redesigned]]''. The band's sixth album features new versions of previously released songs recorded in a different style. Fifteen tracks in total, three from each of the five albums released to date, ''[[Living in A Magazine]]'', ''[[Zoot Woman (album)|Zoot Woman]]'', ''[[Things Are What They Used to Be]]'', ''[[Star Climbing (album)|Star Climbing]]'' &  ''[[Absence (Zoot Woman album)|Absence]]''. 'Redesigned' is an album of predominantly acoustic versions of the band's songs.

===''Maxidrama'' (tba)===
In 2019, the band announced that work had begun on their next album ''[[Maxidrama (Zoot Woman album)|Maxidrama]]'' with new music to be released on August 30. The songs "Where Is The Man" and "Never Felt This Way" released as precursors to the album.

In 2021, a collaboration between [[Solomun]] and Zoot Woman was released. "Out Of Focus" features on Solomun's album ''[[Nobody Is Not Loved (Solomun album)|Nobody Is Not Loved]]'' (BMG)

==Musical style==
[[File:Zoot Woman Johnny Blake live.JPG|thumb|alt=Johnny Blake stands on a stage holding a microphone in both hands. He wears a guitar, there are speakers in front of him and behind him, and a bright green light shines behind him|300px|right|Johnny Blake in 2009]]
Zoot Woman's main genres are [[electronica]], [[alternative rock]] and [[synthpop]]. Heavy use of both [[Digital synthesizer|digital]] and [[Analog synthesizer|analogue synthesizers]] as well as [[drum machine]]s is evident on each album. They are known to blend the use of [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] and [[Electronic music|electronic]] instruments to create their sound.

Many Zoot Woman songs are characterised by lead vocalist Johnny Blake's voice. Blake supports his vocal with a very rhythmic guitar playing style. For live performances he favours the [[Fender Telecaster]] and [[Gibson SG]] guitars. He has written and collaborated with different artists including [[Justice]] on the albums ''[[Woman (Justice album)|Woman]]'' & ''[[Woman Worldwide]]''.

Zoot Woman cite the bands [[Kraftwerk]], [[Depeche Mode]], [[Steely Dan]] & [[The Police]] among their influences.

In an interview with [[Universal Audio (company)|Universal Audio]], Adam Blake discusses some of the group's recording techniques.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uaudio.com/webzine/2010/june/Zoot-Woman-Adam-Blake-UAD-Plug-Ins.html|title=Universal Audio Producer's Corner: Zoot Woman's Adam Blake|publisher=[[Universal Audio (company)|Universal Audio]]|access-date=24 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628041215/http://www.uaudio.com/webzine/2010/june/Zoot-Woman-Adam-Blake-UAD-Plug-Ins.html|archive-date=28 June 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Lyrics==
Zoot Woman song lyrics have been described as melancholic. Often the subject matter in each song centres around love, relationships or more introspective and personal themes. 

==Band's image==
Image is a key conceptual element to the band's output. Johnny Blake is quoted saying, "We've always said we want to look how we sound, so hopefully the look of the band could translate the music. But I think Zoot Woman is built foremost around the songs. There are bands out there where the show describes the band more than the actual music, but with Zoot Woman it's vice versa."{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Zoot Woman have worked with acclaimed video directors [[Dawn Shadforth]], [[Uwe Flade (video director)|Uwe Flade]], [[Michael Kren]], [[Mirjam Baker]] and [[Mike Mills (director)|Mike Mills]]. With photography by [[Rankin (photographer)|Rankin]], [[Sølve Sundsbø]], [[Ben Rigby]], [[Matthias Krause]], [[Normen Perke]] and styling by fashion designer [[Fee Doran]] aka "Mrs Jones".
