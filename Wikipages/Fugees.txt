'''Fugees''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|uː|dʒ|iː|z}}; sometimes '''The Fugees''') is an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group formed in the early 1990s. Deriving its name from a shortening of the word "refugees", the group consists of [[Wyclef Jean]],  [[Pras|Pras Michel]], and [[Lauryn Hill]].<!--There are no sources or citations indicating that Hill is Jamaican. Only add 'Jamaican' as her ethnicity if there is a source for that claim.--> The group rose to fame with its second album, ''[[The Score (Fugees album)|The Score]]'' (1996), one of [[List of best-selling albums|the best-selling albums of all time]]. The group is often cited as being one of the most significant [[alternative hip hop]] groups of the 1990s.

In 1993, the trio signed to [[Ruffhouse]], distributed through [[Columbia Records]]. The following year the group released its debut album, ''[[Blunted on Reality]]'' (1994); the album received mostly favorable reviews, and included the [[Underground hip hop|underground]] [[Salaam Remi]]-remixed hits "[[Nappy Heads]]" and "[[Vocab (song)|Vocab]]". They followed it up with their second and final studio album, ''[[The Score (Fugees album)|The Score]]'' (1996), which was a commercial success, peaking at number one on the US ''[[Billboard 200]]'' chart and being certified seven times platinum in the United States. It received universal acclaim, and is considered to be one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time; it included the hit singles "[[Killing Me Softly with His Song#Fugees version|Killing Me Softly]]", "[[Ready or Not (Fugees song)|Ready or Not]]", and "[[Fu-Gee-La]]". Afterwards, the Fugees released the single "[[Rumble in the Jungle (song)|Rumble in the Jungle]]" (featuring [[Busta Rhymes]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]] & [[John Forté]]), which peaked at number three in the UK. In 1997, the group disbanded so that the members could pursue solo careers. Fugees reunited in 2004, and again in 2021 for reunion tours.

The Fugees has sold over twenty-two million records worldwide, and is one of the biggest-selling hip hop groups of all time. In 2007, [[MTV]] ranked it the ninth-greatest hip-hop group of all time.<ref>{{cite web |title=MTV News: The Greatest Hip-Hop Groups of All Time |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/h/hip_hop_week/2007/groups/index3.jhtml |publisher=[[MTV]] |date=February 1, 2007 |access-date=February 1, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430125827/http://www.mtv.com/bands/h/hip_hop_week/2007/groups/index3.jhtml |archive-date=April 30, 2015}}</ref> [[U2]]'s [[Bono]] dubbed them as "[[The Beatles|the hip hop Beatles]]".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Fugees' Wyclef Reflects on 20th Anniversary of "The Score" - Music News - ABC News Radio|url=http://abcnewsradioonline.com/music-news/2016/2/12/the-fugees-wyclef-reflects-on-20th-anniversary-of-the-score.html|access-date=2021-04-11|website=abcnewsradioonline.com}}</ref> In 2012, [[BET]] placed the group on its list of 'Hip Hop's Greatest Trios'<ref>{{cite web|title=Hip Hop's Greatest Trios |url=https://www.bet.com/content/bet/music/photos/2012/08/rap-s-greatest-trios.html?cid=facebook |website=BET.com |access-date=April 11, 2021}}</ref> The Fugees has won many accolades, including two [[Grammy Award]]s<ref>{{cite web |title=Fugees|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/fugees/7429 |website=GRAMMY.com |date=November 23, 2020 |access-date=April 11, 2021}}</ref> and a [[Brit Award for International Group]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=https://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/1997 |website=BRIT Awards |access-date=April 11, 2021}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation and beginnings===
[[Lauryn Hill]] and [[Pras]] first met at [[Columbia High School (New Jersey)|Columbia High School]], in [[Maplewood, New Jersey]]. Pras, Lauryn, and a mutual friend [[Marcy Harriell]] formed a musical trio called Tyme; Pras' cousin, [[Wyclef Jean]], joined the line-up and Marcy left soon afterward, in 1990.<ref>{{cite journal |title=How Life Changed |journal=XXL |date=March 2011}}</ref> The moniker ''Tranzlator Crew'' refers to the name of their band at the time, which included Johnny Wise on drums, Ti Bass (Jerry) on bass guitar, and Leon (DJ).<ref name=Lorna /> In 1993, after some gigs and recorded demos, the trio signed to [[Ruffhouse]], distributed through [[Columbia Records]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lazerine |first1=Devin |last2=Lazerine |first2=Cameron |title=Rap-Up: The Ultimate Guide to Hip-Hop and R&B |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s5Y7-DTbSMcC&q=Fugees&pg=PT118 |publisher=Grand Central Publishing |date=February 29, 2008 |access-date=August 7, 2018 |isbn=9780446511629 |via=Google Books}}</ref> The members then changed the group's name to ''Fugees'', which was purposely taken from a word often used derogatorily to refer to Haitian-Americans (''refugee'').<ref name="Foege">Foege, Alec. "Fugees (cover story)", ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', September 5, 1996, p. 40-47</ref> Refugee Camp, while a name sometimes credited to the trio, also refers to a number of artists affiliated with the members, and particularly Jean.

=== ''Blunted on Reality'' ===
The trio soon changed musical direction, and released its first hip-hop LP, ''[[Blunted on Reality]]'', under the guidance of [[Kool and the Gang]]'s producer Ronald Bell. The group wrote and recorded the album in 1992 at the House of Music Studios in [[West Orange, New Jersey]]. However, due to a dispute with its record label, the album was not released until February 1, 1994. The Fugees members have subsequently said that they allowed the producers to have too much control over the album's content and form.<ref>''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]''. November 1996. p. 72. Accessed from May 31, 2013.</ref>

Although the album did not contain as many lyrics with overtly political messages as songs from their next and better-known album ''[[The Score (Fugees album)|The Score]]'', there were still political intentions.<ref name="Lorna">{{Cite episode |title=The Fugees |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fiz3BsYk0NY |series=Lorna's Corner |network=Hartford Public Access TV |airdate=1990}}</ref> ''Blunted on Reality'' spawned the singles "[[Blunted on Reality|Boof Baf]]", "[[Nappy Heads]]" and "[[Vocab (song)|Vocab]]", but gained little mainstream attention, despite earning plaudits for its artistic quality and innovative use of samples.<ref>Weheliye, Alexander G. ''Phonographies:Grooves in Sonic Afro-Modernity'', Duke University Press, 2005.</ref> The album's most successful single was "Nappy Heads", which peaked at number 49 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]].

===''The Score''===
The musical qualities of the first Fugees record were revisited with its second album ''[[The Score (Fugees album)|The Score]]'', which was released in February 1996.

''The Score'' became one of the biggest hits of 1996 and one of the best-selling hip-hop albums of all time. The Fugees first gained attention for its [[cover version]]s of old favorites, with the group's reinterpretations of "[[No Woman No Cry]]" by [[Bob Marley & the Wailers]] and "[[Killing Me Softly with His Song]]" (first recorded by [[Lori Lieberman]] in 1971, remade by [[Roberta Flack]] in 1973), the latter being their biggest hit.<ref>{{cite web |last1=February 15|first1=PreezyPublished|last2=2016|title=5 Best Songs From Fugees' 'The Score' Album |url=https://theboombox.com/5-best-songs-from-fugees-the-score-album/|access-date=2021-04-11|website=The Boombox}}</ref>

The album also included a re-interpretation of [[The Delfonics]]' "Ready or Not Here I Come (Can't Hide From Love)" in their hit single, "[[Ready or Not (Fugees song)|Ready or Not]]",<ref>{{cite web|title=First Listen: The Delfonics, 'Adrian Younge Presents The Delfonics'|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/03/04/172983631/first-listen-the-delfonics-adrian-younge-presents-the-delfonics|access-date=2021-04-11|website=NPR.org}}</ref> which featured a prominent [[Sampling (music)|sample]] of [[Enya]]'s "[[Boadicea (song)|Boadicea]]" without the singer's permission. This prompted a lawsuit resulting in a settlement where Enya was given credit and royalties for her sample.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://0-ehis.ebscohost.com.ignacio.usfca.edu/eds/detail?vid=3&hid=5&sid=9ecec6b3-37bd-47c4-ba48-edfd2eaf96f0@sessionmgr11&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ|title=Rap takes Enya's 12 notes up chart|last=Battles|first=Jan|date=March 28, 2004|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|access-date=October 11, 2011}}</ref> The group members have continuously thanked and praised Enya for her deep understanding of the situation, for example in the [[liner notes]] of ''The Score''.

The Fugees won two [[1997 Grammy Awards]] with ''The Score'' ([[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album|Best Rap Album]]) and "Killing Me Softly" ([[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group]]).

They produced remixes of [[Michael Jackson]]'s "[[Blood on the Dance Floor (song)|Blood on the Dance Floor]]" and "[[Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix|2 Bad]]".<ref>{{cite web|author=MTV News Staff|title=The Fugees Talk About Remixing Michael Jackson|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1429268/the-fugees-talk-about-remixing-michael-jackson/|access-date=2021-06-11|website=MTV News}}</ref>

===Later career===
In 1997, the Fugees all began solo projects: Hill began writing and producing for a number of artists (including [[Whitney Houston]], [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[Mary J. Blige]]) and started work on her critically acclaimed ''[[The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill]]''; Jean also began producing for a number of artists (including [[Canibus]], [[Destiny's Child]] and [[Carlos Santana]]) and recorded his debut album ''[[Wyclef Jean Presents The Carnival]]''; Pras, with [[Mýa]] and [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]], recorded the single "[[Ghetto Supastar (That Is What You Are)]]" for the soundtrack to the film ''[[Bulworth]]''. In 1998, they reunited to shoot a music video for the song "Just Happy to Be Me" which appeared in the ''[[Sesame Street]]'' special ''[[Elmopalooza]]'', and also on the Grammy Award-winning [[Elmopalooza! (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Q0EAAAAMBAJ&q=fugees+just+happy+to+be+me&pg=PA63|title=Billboard|date=2003-07-12|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.}}</ref>

The three Fugees reunited and performed on September 18, 2004, at the concert in [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]], [[Brooklyn]] featured in the film ''[[Dave Chappelle's Block Party]]'' (2004), headlining a star-studded bill that included [[Kanye West]], [[Mos Def]], [[Jill Scott]], [[Erykah Badu]], [[The Roots]], [[Talib Kweli]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[Big Daddy Kane]], [[Dead Prez]], [[Cody ChesnuTT]] and [[John Legend]]. Their performance received several positive reviews, many of which praised Hill's near [[a cappella]] rendition of "Killing Me Softly".<ref>{{cite web |last=Schwartz |first=Danny|date=2021-03-04|title=The Making of Dave Chappelle's Iconic 'Block Party'|url=https://www.theringer.com/movies/2021/3/4/22312236/dave-chappelle-block-party-making-of-history-anniversary|access-date=2021-04-11|website=The Ringer}}</ref>

The Fugees made their first televised appearance in almost ten years at [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]]'s 2005 Music Awards on June 28, opening the show with a twelve-minute set.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Baltin |first=Steve |date=2005-06-29|title=Fugees Surprise at BET Awards|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/fugees-surprise-at-bet-awards-118260/|access-date=2021-04-11|magazine=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref> With a new album announced to be in the works, their final track, "Take It Easy", was leaked online and eventually released as an [[Music download|Internet single]] on September 27, 2005.<ref>{{citation|title=The Fugees Take It Easy - IGN|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/09/29/the-fugees-take-it-easy |access-date=2021-04-11}}</ref> It peaked at number 40 on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks|R&B Chart]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Fugees|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/fugees/chart-history/BSI|access-date=2021-04-11|magazine=Billboard}}</ref>

In November 2005, Fugees embarked on a European tour – the members' first together since 1997 – from 30 November to 20 December, playing in [[Finland]], [[Austria]], [[Norway]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Slovakia]]. The group had been scheduled to play at the [[Hammersmith Apollo]] on November 25, 2005; however, it was forced to move the gig to December due to production issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/10365/the-fugees-forced-to-reschedule-tour-date|title=The Fugees Forced To Reschedule Tour Date|website=Gigwise.com|access-date=August 7, 2018}}</ref> The tour received mixed reviews. On February 6, 2006, the group reunited for a free show in Hollywood, with tickets given away to about 8,000 fans by local radio stations. Later that month, a new track called "Foxy" was leaked, a song dubbed the "real return of the Fugees" by several online music blogs.

However, following the reunion tour, the album that was said to be in the works did not materialize and was postponed indefinitely, as relationships between band members apparently deteriorated. During the recording of the album, the group was plagued with creative differences.<ref>{{cite web|date=2017-07-19|title=If You're Waiting for The Fugees Reunion, Don't Hold Your Breath|url=https://www.ebony.com/entertainment/music/sorry-fans-no-reunion-for-the-fugees/|access-date=2021-04-11|website=EBONY|language=en-US}}</ref> They recorded a song titled "Lips Don't Lie", but Hill did not like the song and, after some disagreements over it, the group disbanded again. The song was ultimately given to singer [[Shakira]] with featured vocals by Jean and after the title was changed to "[[Hips Don't Lie]]", the song was released a single and became a global hit.<ref>{{cite web|last1=February 26|first1=India Today Web Desk|last2=February 26|first2=2016UPDATED|last3=Ist|first3=2016 20:24|title=10 years of Shakira's Hips Don't Lie: 7 facts about the song the world is obsessed with|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/music/story/10-years-of-shakiras-hips-dont-lie-shakira-music-wyclef-jean-310727-2016-02-26|access-date=2021-04-11|website=India Today}}</ref> In August 2007, a year after the group's second disbandment, Pras stated, "Before I work with Lauryn Hill again, you will have a better chance of seeing [[Osama Bin Laden]] and [[George W.

In my personal opinion, those Fugees reunion shows shouldn't have been done, because we wasn't ready. I really felt we shoulda first all gone into a room with Lauryn and a psychiatrist... But, you know, I do believe Lauryn can get help. And, once she does work things out, hopefully a proper and enduring Fugees reunion will happen."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/360/wyclef_jean_perfect_gentelman/|title=WYCLEF JEAN: Perfect Gentleman |first=Stephen|last=Clark|website=Bluesandsoul.com|access-date=August 7, 2018}}</ref> On July 15, 2017, an old song by the Fugees was leaked on Hot 97 radio; this led to reports that the group was reforming, which were later denied by group members on Twitter.

After the group split, [[Wyclef Jean]] co-founded and headed the [[Yéle Haiti Foundation|Yele Haiti Foundation]], a non-profit organization "focusing on emergency relief, employment, youth development and education, and tree planting and agriculture" in [[Haiti]].<ref>"Who We Are."

Their sound was multifaceted because they were, too, their music diverse, just like the [[African-American culture|Black experience]]."<ref>{{cite web|title=Fugees: The Score|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/fugees-the-score/|access-date=2021-05-29|website=Pitchfork}}</ref> ''[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]]'' noted that Fugees delivered political messages and brought hip hop to the mainstream in their music by blending elements of [[Pop music|pop]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[dancehall]] and [[Caribbean Music|Caribbean music]], making it more palpable for a wider audience without making the message dense, stating "Fugees disguised resistance as art, the same way that [[Atlantic slave trade|enslaved Africans]] once hid martial arts from their colonial masters by pretending that they were a dance."<ref>{{cite web|last=Okwonga|first=Musa|date=2021-02-12|title=In 'The Score,' the Fugees Made Refugees the Heroes of an Epic Tale|url=https://www.theringer.com/music/2021/2/12/22280168/the-fugees-the-score-diguise-resistance-as-art|access-date=2021-05-29|website=The Ringer}}</ref>

Writing for [[The Recording Academy]], music journalist [[Kathy Iandoli]] wrote about the impact of the group on the hip hop genre stating: <blockquote>"As hip-hop's [[East Coast hip hop|East]] and [[West Coast hip hop|West Coasts]] continued their tussle, their lighter-hearted approach to socially conscious rap curtailed any overarching assumptions that hip-hop was going down a "bad road". Plus, they had Lauryn Hill, who doubled as a songbird and lyrical spitfire. Together, by juxtaposing life instrumentation, soulful melodies and abstract bars, The Fugees gave hip-hop a renewed spirit and propelled it to a different kind of [[Popular music|mainstream]]".<ref>{{cite web|date=2021-04-06|title=For The Record: The Fugees 'The Score' At 25|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/2021-for-the-record-fugees-the-score|access-date=2021-05-29|website=GRAMMY.com}}</ref></blockquote>Multiple recording artists have cited The Fugees as an influence, including [[Bono]],<ref>{{cite magazine |author=[[Bono]] |date=2020-05-15|title=Bono: 60 Songs That Saved My Life|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/bono-60-songs-that-saved-my-life-999226/|access-date=2021-05-30 |magazine=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref> [[Drake (musician)|Drake]],<ref>{{cite web|date=2016-01-29|title=8-Year-Old Drake Reciting "Ready Or Not" Is All Kinds Of Awesome|url=https://www.vibe.com/music/music-news/8-year-old-drake-killing-me-softly-401678/|access-date=2021-05-29|website=VIBE.com}}</ref> [[Kanye West]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Kanye West Influences|url=https://www.shmoop.com/through-the-wire/influences.html|access-date=2021-05-29 |website=www.shmoop.com}}</ref> [[Akon]],<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Scaggs |first=Austin |date=2007-04-19 |title=Q&A: Akon|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/qa-akon-77485/|access-date=2021-05-30 |magazine=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref> [[Black Eyed Peas]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Easlea |first=Daryl |title=Let's Get It Started: The Rise & Rise of the Black Eyed Peas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5zv_AgAAQBAJ&dq=%22fugees%22influenced+%22black+eyed+peas%22&pg=PT45|date=2012-10-15|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-0-85712-795-2}}</ref> [[Young Thug]],<ref>{{cite web |date=2017-01-17 |title=Young Thug's "Wyclef Jean" Video Is Weird & Awesome As F*ck|url=https://www.vibe.com/music/videos/young-thug-wyclef-jean-video-music-480598/|access-date=2021-05-29|website=VIBE.com}}</ref> [[Bridgit Mendler]],<ref>{{cite web|last=C|first=Jeff|date=2013-01-15|title=Bridgit Mendler Talks Fugees Influence On 'Ready Or Not' {{!}} popdirt.com|url=http://popdirt.com/bridgit-mendler-talks-fugees-influence-on-ready-or-not/122712/|access-date=2021-05-29 |website=popdirt.com|language=en-US}}</ref> [[Sean Kingston]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Watkins|first=Grouchy Greg |date=2007-05-04|title=Sean Kingston: Trenchtown Rap|url=https://allhiphop.com/features/sean-kingston-trenchtown-rap/ |access-date=2021-05-30|website=AllHipHop|language=en-US}}</ref> [[Ava Max]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Nast |first=Condé |title=Ava Max Creates the Playlist of Her Life|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/video/watch/playlist-of-my-life-ava-max-creates-the-playlist-of-her-life|access-date=2021-05-30|website=Teen Vogue|language=en-US}}</ref> [[Doja Cat]],<ref>{{cite web|date=2020-12-31|title=Who Is Doja Cat's Mom?

==Scholarship==
Alexander Weheliye's "Sounding Diasporic Citizenship" looks to the Fugees to consider the possibility for the term "refugee" to be a liberating call that builds international community as an empowering form of 'diasporic citizenship'. He writes that the Fugees "address the prejudices against Haitians in the States and also reclaim the figure of the Haitian refugee not as an instantiation of the abject but as a point of solidarity."<ref>Alexander G Weheliye. "Sounding Diasporic Citizenship" in ''Phonographies: Grooves in Sonic Afro-Modernity''. (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2005), 150.</ref>
