Gates' lyrics often deal with subjects like depression, poverty, and prison time.<ref name="Noisey"/><ref name="HHDXFiction"/> He has listed numerous artists among his influences including [[Nas]], [[Biggie Smalls]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Tupac Shakur]], [[Eminem]], and others.<ref name="RS2014"/>

==Personal life==
Gates married his longtime girlfriend, Dreka Haynes, in October 2015. The couple have two children, Islah and Khaza.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://thesource.com/2016/04/18/interview-meet-dreka-gates-kevin-gates-beloved-wife-the-force-behind-his-music-career/|title=[Interview] Meet Dreka Gates, Kevin Gates' Beloved Wife & The Force Behind His Music Career {{!}} The Source|date=April 18, 2016|work=The Source|access-date=December 31, 2017|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101135504/http://thesource.com/2016/04/18/interview-meet-dreka-gates-kevin-gates-beloved-wife-the-force-behind-his-music-career/|archive-date=January 1, 2018}}</ref> Gates hinted that he had children by other women in a 2013 interview with ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'': "I got some children. I'm real real close with them. I lay in the bed with them, hold them, love on them. It really doesn't make sense to say [how many kids I have]. Not in a bad way, but it's not like the public will ever get to see my children, and if they do see them, they aren't going to know they're mine."

Gates is a practicing [[Islam|Muslim]] along with his wife, and went in September 2016 to [[Mecca]] for [[Hajj]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/06/muslim-rappers/|title=22 Rappers Who Are Muslim |website=XXL Mag|access-date=December 1, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161205004134/http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/06/muslim-rappers/|archive-date=December 5, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/realdrekagates/status/774121047616397312|title=Dreka Gates on Twitter|newspaper=Twitter|access-date=December 1, 2016}}</ref>

== Legal issues ==
Gates' first arrest occurred when he was 13 for being a passenger in a stolen vehicle. Gates was briefly jailed for the offense, and said that being jailed had a profound effect on his life: "If they would've just pulled up to the jail, left me in the police car, never took me inside and just took me back home, I don't think I'd ever have done anything else again. But what it did was—by me going into jail at such a young age—all it did was criminalize me in a sense. It kinda steered me in the wrong direction after getting there and settling in; it took the fear of jail away from me."<ref name="TrapWorld" />

In 2003, Gates was involved in an altercation outside a movie theatre and stabbed his opponent multiple times.<ref name="TrapWorld" />

Gates was charged with battery for kicking a fan in the summer of 2015 while he was performing on stage at an event in [[Lakeland, Florida]].
