He first emerged as a rapper, releasing his debut album, ''[[Who Needs Actions When You Got Words]]'', in 2006.

Drew explained his stage name during an appearance on ''[[USA Today]]'' in 2007, stating, "The whole reason for calling myself Plan B was that I was doing this sweet-boy [[Justin Timberlake]] shit, but I never felt comfortable... when I started rapping, it was easier for me to feel comfortable."<ref name=USAToday>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2007-03-14-new-brits-planb_N.htm| title=Plan B: Not to be confused with Eminem| publisher=USA Today| access-date=10 January 2010 | first=Steve | last=Jones | date=15 March 2007}}</ref>

Butler, [[Vicky McClure]] and [[Kaya Scodelario]], which had its own premiere on 16 November 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stereoboard.com/content/view/162168/46 |title=Plan B Announces New Single 'Love Goes Down' – Stereoboard UK |publisher=Stereoboard.com |date=4 November 2010 |access-date=9 November 2010}}</ref>

He performed a duet of "[[I Guess That's Why They Call It the Blues]]" with [[Elton John]] as part of Elton's [[BBC Electric Proms]] performance at [[the Roundhouse]] in London in October 2010.

On 16 February 2011, Drew won Best British Male at the [[Brit Awards]]. Later that year he announced that he was working on a new album called ''The Ballad of Belmarsh'', which was to be a hip-hop [[concept album]] telling the story of Plan B's alter-ego, Strickland Banks. Work on the album was later put on hold to focus on the film ''Ill Manors'' and it was ultimately shelved completely.

In March 2012, he released the single and video for "[[Ill Manors (song)|Ill Manors]]", a song (containing a sample from [[Peter Fox (musician)|Peter Fox]]'s "[[Alles neu]]") which deals with the [[2011 London Riots]], and which was described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as "the first great mainstream protest song in years".<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/mar/15/plan-b-ill-manors | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Dorian | last=Lynskey | title=Why Plan B's Ill Manors is the greatest British protest song in years | date=15 March 2012}}</ref> A [[Ill Manors (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] and [[Ill Manors|film of the same name]] (Drew's first as both writer and director) were released in June 2012, followed by three more singles: "[[Lost My Way]]", "[[Deepest Shame]]" and "[[Playing with Fire (Plan B song)|Playing with Fire]]".

In July 2012, Drew issued an apology after he appeared on the cover of ''Shortlist'' magazine wearing a [[t-shirt]] featuring white supremacist rock band [[Skrewdriver]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/plan-b-28-1263842 |title=Plan B responds to 'neo-Nazi' t-shirt criticism |author=Jamie Crossan |date=22 July 2012 |newspaper=[[NME]]}}</ref>

On 18 May 2017, Drew released his first single in 5 years titled "In the Name of Man" and announced that he had been in the studio recording an album via [[Twitter]]. The album, ''[[Heaven Before All Hell Breaks Loose]]'', was released on 13 April 2018. He said in an interview that this album is less hip-hop orientated than his first two albums "....because I feel that I'm not being honest with myself if I'm living the high life and I'm trying to rap about the other side of things".<ref>{{cite news|title=Big albums for 2018: Kylie Minogue, Arctics Monkeys, and Plan B|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/big-albums-for-2018-kylie-minogue-arctics-monkeys-and-plan-b-36459849.html|newspaper=Belfasttelegraph|access-date=20 January 2018}}</ref> Drew said that he had taken time off from the music industry to focus on fatherhood, and also to connect with friends and family he says he felt alienated from after the release of ''Ill Manors''. "I felt spiritually lost at the end of ''Ill Manors''. I hadn't seen my family, really, since 2009. Certain friendships were just completely dissolving. I'd always felt like I was fighting to be taken seriously, fighting for recognition, and suddenly I had it all, and I thought, 'Shit, I've got nothing to fight for.'" <ref>{{cite web|last1=Mossman|first1=Kate|title=Time for a new Plan B: puppets, politics and parenthood|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/26/time-for-a-new-plan-b-puppets-politics-and-parenthood|website=The Guardian|date=26 May 2017|access-date=20 January 2018}}</ref>

== Film career ==

=== Acting ===
After previously appearing in [[Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard]]'s short film ''Walking After Acconci (Redirected Approaches)'' in 2005,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/826751? | title=Walking After Acconci (Redirected Approaches) | publisher=BFI | access-date=18 January 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022040113/http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/826751 | archive-date=22 October 2012 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Drew's first major film role was as a supporting character (Dabs) in [[Noel Clarke]]'s ''[[Adulthood (film)|Adulthood]]'' (2008).<ref name="IMDB">{{cite web| url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2304008/ | title= Ben Drew | publisher=The Internet Movie Database | access-date=27 December 2009}}</ref> His song "Kidz" was previously included in the soundtrack to ''[[Kidulthood]]'' (2006), which led to Drew being cast in the sequel.

In 2009, Drew had another supporting role as Noel Winters in the [[Daniel Barber (director)|Daniel Barber]] film ''[[Harry Brown (film)|Harry Brown]]'',<ref name="IMDB" /> starring [[Michael Caine]]. In 2010, Drew appeared in Noel Clarke's film ''[[4.3.2.1.]]''.<ref name="IMDB" /> Drew's most recent role has been co-starring in ''[[The Sweeney (2012 film)|The Sweeney]]'' film, based on the [[The Sweeney|1970s British TV show of the same name]], alongside [[Ray Winstone]], playing the role of George Carter. The film was released on 12 September 2012 and went straight in at number 1 in the box office charts.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gant |first=Charles |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/sep/18/the-sweeney-uk-box-office |title=The Sweeney is off to a Flying Squad start at the UK box office &#124; Film &#124; guardian.co.uk |work=The Guardian |date=18 September 2012 |access-date=23 March 2013}}</ref>

=== Directing ===
Drew expressed an interest in working in film early in his music career. In an interview about ''Who Needs Actions When You Got Words'', he said: "We're still promoting this album and I've started work on the next one, but I'm really getting into film at the moment. I'm writing this script, and I really want to find some time to focus on it, I really feel that's what I'm destined to be doing".<ref>[http://www.thebeatsbar.co.uk/ccinterviews/planb.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928014629/http://www.thebeatsbar.co.uk/ccinterviews/planb.html |date=28 September 2007 }}</ref>

In 2008, Drew directed his first short film ''Michelle'',<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dnrfilms.net/portfolio.php?id=1&art=12&pageNum_list_curr_portfolio_details=3&totalRows_list_curr_portfolio_details=19 | title=Plan B – Michelle | publisher=DNR Films | access-date=27 December 2009 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914070126/http://www.dnrfilms.net/portfolio.php?id=1&art=12&pageNum_list_curr_portfolio_details=3&totalRows_list_curr_portfolio_details=19 | archive-date=14 September 2010 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> which starred [[Adam Deacon]] and [[Ed Skrein]]. He also directed the music video for "[[Pieces (Chase & Status song)|Pieces]]" (his collaboration with [[Chase & Status]]).

Drew began production on his first full-length feature film, ''[[Ill Manors]]'', in September 2010. Speaking in March 2010 to UK soul-writer Pete Lewis (Deputy Editor of the award-winning [[Blues & Soul]]), Drew described 'Ill Manors': "It's a hip hop, music-based feature film which has six short stories that all kinda mix together to make one BIG story – and each mini-story will be represented by a different hip hop track. It'll all be narrated by me, and it'll actually be the reverse of 'The Defamation Of Strickland Banks' – in that with 'Ill Manors', the film will come out first and the soundtrack will come afterwards. And again the soundtrack will be a film for the blind, in that you'll be able to listen to it and it'll tell you the story of the film."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/522/plan_b_from_a_to_b |title=Plan B interview by Pete Lewis, 'Blues & Soul' April 2010 |publisher=Bluesandsoul.com |date=6 April 2010 |access-date=9 November 2010}}</ref>
