'''Fu-Schnickens''' were an American [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] trio from 1988 to 1995, based in [[Brooklyn]], New York.

== History ==
Fu-Schnickens was composed of '''Chip Fu''' ('''Roderick Roachford'''), '''Moc Fu''' ('''Joe Jones'''), and '''Poc Fu''' ('''Lennox Maturine'''). ''Fu'' stood for unity and ''schnicken'' was a made-up word that meant “coalition”.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p26098|pure_url=yes}}|title=Fu-Schnickens: Biography|author=Huey, Steve|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2009-07-18}}</ref> The three friends from [[East Flatbush, Brooklyn]], first gained attention after performing at a hip hop event at [[Howard University]], after which the group was signed by [[Jive Records]].<ref name="allmusic"/> The group's debut single, "Ring the Alarm", entered the top ten on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Rap Tracks]] chart in 1992,<ref name="charts">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p26098|pure_url=yes}}|title=Fu-Schnickens: Charts & Awards|publisher=allmusic|access-date=2009-07-18}}</ref> which sparked anticipation for the group's debut album, ''[[F.U. Don't Take It Personal]]'', and also inadvertently immortalized and ignited a new-found popularity for the original "Ring the Alarm", the signature tune of dancehall reggae [[singjay]] [[Tenor Saw]] from 1985, which the group sampled to create its track of the same name. Furthermore, with the hit singles "La Schmoove" (featuring [[Phife Dawg]] of [[A Tribe Called Quest]]) and "True Fu-Schnick," the album reached the top 20 on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart <ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="charts"/> and was certified for [[gold album|gold]]-level sales by the [[RIAA]].<ref name="Fu-SchnickensRIAA">{{certification Cite|region=United States|title=Take It Personally|artist=Fu-Schnickens|type=album}}</ref>

In 1993, Fu-Schnickens began work on its second album. The group recorded a fast-paced song called "What's Up, Doc?" which featured a sample of [[Bugs Bunny]] saying his famous [[catchphrase]]. But the group could not get sample clearance from [[Warner Bros.]] so the song was shelved. Meanwhile, the then-[[rookie]] [[NBA]] star [[Shaquille O'Neal]] was a media sensation. In many interviews, he talked about his love of [[hip hop music]] and stated that the Fu-Schnickens were his favorite hip hop group. This prompted the group to contact O'Neal for a collaboration. O'Neal recorded a verse that was added on to the already-recorded "What's Up, Doc?" with the group and O'Neal saying "What's up, doc?" to replace the [[Bugs Bunny]] sample. Although the group had not yet completed work on its album, the song was quickly released as a single to capitalize on O'Neal's popularity. The single was a [[Top 40|top-40]] hit in the summer of 1993,<ref name="charts"/> which briefly propelled the group into the mainstream.<ref name="allmusic"/> The group's second album, ''[[Nervous Breakdown (Fu-Schnickens album)|Nervous Breakdown]]'', did not arrive until 1994.

The group took part in a huge performance on the finale of ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'', alongside the likes of [[KRS-One]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Naughty by Nature]], [[MC Lyte]], [[Guru (rapper)|Guru]], [[Mad Lion]], [[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]], [[Das EFX]], [[CL Smooth]], and [[A Tribe Called Quest]].

Fu-Schnickens is also notable for its many references to [[martial arts films]] and [[Culture of Asia|Asian culture]] before [[Wu-Tang Clan]],<ref name="allmusic"/> which eventually helped make such references popular in hip hop music.
