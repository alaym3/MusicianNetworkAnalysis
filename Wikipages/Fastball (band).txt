== History ==

=== Formation ===
In 1995, [[Tony Scalzo]], Miles Zuniga, and Joey Shuffield formed Fastball in [[Austin, Texas]]. Zuniga and Shuffield first played together in a band called Big Car.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> After a stint with another group called Wild Seeds, Shuffield introduced Zuniga to Scalzo, who had played in a band called the Goods in [[Orange County, California]]. The trio decided to form their own band, and began playing around the Austin area.

When they first started out, the band tried out several names, such as Star 69, Magneto, Magneto USA, Ed Clark's Business Bible and Starchy, before finally deciding to adopt the name Fastball.

=== ''Make Your Mama Proud'' ===
Fastball quickly built a strong following in the Austin area, and created a regional buzz. As a result, a local journalist spotted them, and suggested that Hollywood Records check them out. They did, and Fastball soon signed a [[recording contract]]. Scalzo and Zuniga took turns singing and writing the songs, while Shuffield backed them up on drums. In 1996, ''[[Make Your Mama Proud]]'' arrived in stores. The album didn't sell very well, but it did win (they tied with another local Austin band, The Wannabes) for the "Best Pop Band" category at the Austin Music Awards. The following year, the members of Fastball were unsure of their future.

=== ''All the Pain Money Can Buy'' ===
The members of Fastball still had side jobs as late as January 1998. Tony Scalzo worked the graveyard shift at The [[Bagel]] Manufactory in Austin. He, Shuffield, and Zuniga would be on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' and ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' just four months later. Fastball's second album, ''[[All the Pain Money Can Buy]]'', was released on Hollywood Records. Within just six months, it had sold more than a million copies.

The single "[[The Way (Fastball song)|The Way]]" stayed on top of Billboard's [[Modern Rock Tracks chart]] for seven weeks, and was a top five hit on Billboard's [[Top 40 Mainstream]] chart. Scalzo was inspired to write the song in 1997, after reading a news article about Lela and Raymond Howard, an elderly couple who had disappeared in Texas. Though Lela had [[Alzheimer's]] and Raymond was recovering from brain surgery, the couple had been driving to a local festival.  They were discovered two weeks later, dead, at the bottom of a [[ravine]] near [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]], hundreds of miles off their intended route.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.texnews.com/texas97/coup071497.html|title=Salado couple shared passions for church, each other |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315061028/http://www.texnews.com/texas97/coup071497.html|archive-date=March 15, 2014 |access-date=October 3, 2016}}</ref>   Scalzo chose to imagine that they began reminiscing and decided to become [[Non-physical entity|ethereal beings]] on a permanent romantic trip, the answer to the song's question, "Where were they going without ever knowing the way?"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.signature-reads.com/2014/04/memoir-in-a-melody-the-tragic-disappearance-behind-fastballs-the-way/ |title=Memoir in a Melody: The Tragic Disappearance Behind Fastball’s ‘The Way’ |last1=Staggs|first1=Matt|date=April 23, 2014 |website=signature-reads.com |publisher=[[Penguin Random House]] |access-date=October 3, 2016}}</ref>

Fastball followed up "The Way" with a second single "[[Fire Escape (song)|Fire Escape]]" and a third single, "[[Out of My Head (Fastball song)|Out of My Head]]", which reached the top ten on Billboard's Top 40 chart and was a top ten hit on the Adult Top 40 chart for 29 weeks. The album's promotional tour featured [[Marcy Playground]] and [[Everclear (band)|Everclear]], after which Fastball moved to the [[H.O.R.D.E. Tour|H.O.R.D.E. tour]].

In 1999, Fastball received two [[Grammy Award]] nominations as a result of ''All the Pain Money Can Buy''. One was for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals, and the other was Best Long Form Video for "The Way". They also received an [[MTV Award]] nomination for Best New Artist.

=== ''The Harsh Light of Day'' ===
The group headed back into the studio to record their third album, ''[[The Harsh Light of Day]]''. Produced by Julian Raymond and Fastball, the album was released in September 2000.

The release included "[[You're An Ocean|You're an Ocean]]", which featured the piano stylings of [[Billy Preston]] (who previously collaborated with The Beatles).  Singer-guitarist [[Brian Setzer]] also contributed to the album with Latin guitar on "Love Is Expensive and Free." "Instead of tailoring the music for short attention spans, we tried to make an album that holds up well to extensive listening... kind of cinematic, where you notice new themes entering the frame each time you see the film," Zuniga said in the band's record company bio.

Although ''The Harsh Light of Day'' sold fewer than 85,000 copies (compared to ''All The Pain Money Can Buy's'' 1,000,000+), the trio didn't lose steam and chalked it up to lacking a musical category to fit into. "You can't write down what we do in a sentence," Zuniga told Mac Randall at [[Launch.com]]. "Marketing us is a problem. But in a way, that's our saving grace also, because you can't find an easy angle to summarize us and exploit us. We might sell more records if you could, but at the same time, it forces people that really want to be interested in us to pay a little more attention to what we're doing."

In October 2000, Fastball began touring in support of ''The Harsh Light of Day'' in [[Amsterdam]]. Despite the slowed success, the members of the group didn't regret any of their creative decisions, and their aim remained true. "It makes me feel proud that we're one of these song-oriented guitar bands," Scalzo told Richard Skanse in ''[[Rolling Stone]].'' "I think there's a couple of bands that are still putting out real good quality guitar rock songs, and I think we're one of them."

=== ''Keep Your Wig On'' ===

In June 2004, Fastball released their fourth album, ''Keep Your Wig On'', on a new record label, Rykodisc. ''Keep Your Wig On'' was home to singles "Airstream", "Drifting Away", and "Lou-ee, Lou-ee", with the last being released as a single in Europe only.

In 2007, "The Way" was voted No.&nbsp;94 on VH1's television special The 100 Greatest Songs of the 90s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.vh1.com/2007-12-13/top-100-songs-of-the-90s/ |title=The Top 100 Songs of the '90s |publisher=VH1 |access-date=April 17, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214035830/http://blog.vh1.com/2007-12-13/top-100-songs-of-the-90s |archive-date=February 14, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>

=== ''Little White Lies'' and solo projects===
On April 14, 2009, Fastball released its fifth album, ''[[Little White Lies (album)|Little White Lies]]''. The album was co-produced by Zuniga and experienced producer CJ Eiriksson, with mixing by [[Bob Clearmountain]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idiomag.com/peek/65311/white_lies|title=Fastball returns with "Little White Lies"|access-date=February 19, 2009|date=February 17, 2009|publisher=[[idiomag]]}}</ref>

Scalzo and Zuniga would work on separate solo projects in the following years, with Zuniga's solo album "These Ghosts Have Bones" being released in September 2011 and Scalzo releasing "My Favorite Year" in February 2013. Both were successfully funded with the help of their respective Kickstarter campaigns.

In April 2013, a new single titled "Love Comes in Waves" was released to digital outlets. The video premiered on YouTube on July 23, 2013.

=== ''Step Into Light'' ===
On February 5, 2015, the band began recording a new album at The Bubble recording studio in Austin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/498110930201359/photos/a.596964153649369.1073741828.498110930201359/931704996841948/|title=Fastball – Timeline Photos|access-date=June 18, 2015|date=February 5, 2015}}</ref> In March, the band announced that "Love Comes in Waves" would be featured on the band's forthcoming album ''Step Into Light'', which was released on May 19. A video for a second song from the album, "I Will Never Let You Down", was released in early March 2017.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Geslani|first1=Michelle|title=Fastball are back with a video for new song "I Will Never Let You Down" — watch|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/03/fastball-are-back-with-a-video-for-new-song-never-let-you-down-watch/|website=[[Consequence of Sound]]|access-date=21 April 2017|date=7 March 2017}}</ref>

In mid-September 2017 the band played a living room concert at the home of Los Angeles-based comic [[Chet Wild]] following a nearly-year long Twitter campaign (#FastballAtChets). The concert raised $12,500 via [[Indiegogo]] to assist with [[Hurricane Harvey]] relief efforts. Several attendees at the concert took part in the filming of the video for "Best Friend" earlier that day, directed by [[Nigel Dick]].

=== ''The Help Machine'' ===
In 2018 and 2019, the band debuted new songs "The Girl You Pretended to Be", "Help Machine" and "All Gone Fuzzy," from ''The Help Machine'', their seventh album, which was released on October 18, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fastballtheband.com/news/2019/7/31/new-album-the-help-machine|title=New Album: The Help Machine|website=Fastballtheband.com|access-date=December 5, 2019}}</ref>
