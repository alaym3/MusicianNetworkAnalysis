==Early life==
Archy Marshall was born to Rachel Howard and Adam Marshall in [[Southwark]], London.<ref name="guardian 2013 interview">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/24/king-krule-interview|title=King Krule: 'Basically, I hated everyone'|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Rob|date=2013-08-24|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-10|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> He has family in the [[Czech Republic]].<ref name="52 insights interview">{{Cite news|url=https://www.52-insights.com/king-krule-through-his-fractured-world-album-musician-industry-kanye/|title=King Krule Through His Fractured World|date=2017-10-12|work=52 Insights|access-date=2020-09-24}}</ref> During an interview with ''The Guardian''{{'}}s Rob Fitzpatrick, Marshall said that from a young age, he experienced discipline issues and refused to go to school.<ref name="guardian 2013 interview"/> Throughout his childhood, he spent much of his time between his father's house in [[Peckham]] and his mother's house in [[East Dulwich]]; his mother was much less strict than his father, who had many rules.<ref name="guardian 2013 interview"/> Marshall recalls that his father had to physically carry him to school, otherwise he would skip and hide in his room.<ref name="guardian 2013 interview"/> Once he turned 13 years old, he was given a private house tutor. He was later accepted into the [[Brit School]] to study art, where he struggled with discipline initially, but soon found his place.<ref name="guardian 2013 interview"/>

Marshall has said that he was tested for several mental health conditions at London's [[Maudsley Hospital]].<ref name="guardian 2013 interview"/> He claims that the tests took a toll on him; that the doctors, counsellors and psychiatrists were wrong most of the time; that he hated everybody; and that he would hide in his room for hours on end. He refers to his mental health issues, such as depression and insomnia, in some of his lyrics.<ref name="guardian 2013 interview"/>

During an interview with [[National Public Radio|NPR]], Marshall recalled that he often created art in many different media, as his parents encouraged creativity throughout his childhood.<ref name="npr every day">{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2015/12/10/459101505/we-make-stuff-every-day-king-krules-archy-marshall-on-his-new-multi-media-album|title='We Make Stuff Every Day': King Krule's Archy Marshall On His New Multi-Media Album|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-11-10|language=en}}</ref> He noted that visual art in particular is important to him, and he mentioned that he carefully crafts his music videos and album art such that they reflect his particular aesthetic sensibility.<ref name="npr every day"/>

== Career ==
During Marshall's years at [[Forest Hill School]] and then at the Brit School alongside long-time collaborator [[Jamie Isaac]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Zadeh|first1=Joe|title=OTW #531: Jamie Isaac|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/features/otw-531-jamie-isaac|website=Clash Music|access-date=18 September 2014}}</ref> between 2008 and 2011, he released two singles as "Zoo Kid". He created a genre of music called "Bluewave" and its form was realised in the mixtape entitled ''U.F.O.W.A.V.E''. In July 2011, Marshall began playing under a new moniker, King Krule, at a festival in [[Hyères]], France.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/07/timely-king-krule/|title=Timely – King Krule|newspaper=nytimes.com|date=7 September 2011}}</ref> Later that year he released his [[King Krule (EP)|eponymous debut EP]]. Contrary to some reports, his stage name is not inspired by the character of [[King K. Rool]] from the [[Donkey Kong#Donkey Kong Country series|''Donkey Kong'' ''Country'']] video game series, but rather by the [[Elvis Presley]] film ''[[King Creole]]''.<ref name="NYT: Krule on his debut"/>

On 9 December 2012, the [[BBC]] announced that he had been nominated for the [[Sound of...|Sound of 2013]] poll.<ref name="so13">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p010q6bc/profiles/kingkrule|title=Sound of 2013 Profiles: King Krule|publisher=BBC|date=9 December 2012|access-date=10 December 2012}}</ref>

King Krule released his debut album ''[[6 Feet Beneath the Moon]]'' on 24 August 2013, his 19th birthday. More than half of the tracks had already been released on his EPs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stillinrock.com/2013/09/album-review-king-krule-6-feet-beneath.html |title=Brooklyn based Music Blog: Album Review : King Krule – 6 Feet Beneath the Moon (Blue Wave) |publisher=Still in Rock |date=26 February 2004 |access-date=30 July 2014}}</ref> This brought him to prominence, especially in the US, with performances on ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'' and the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/52806-watch-king-krule-play-easy-easy-on-letterman/ |title=Watch King Krule Play "Easy Easy" on "Letterman" &#124; News |website=Pitchfork.com |date=29 October 2013 |access-date=30 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://teamcoco.com/video/king-krule-11-04-2013 |title=King Krule "A Lizard State" 11/04/13 @ |website=Teamcoco.com |access-date=30 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012134447/http://teamcoco.com/video/king-krule-11-04-2013 |archive-date=12 October 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On 8 January 2014, he released a video for "A Lizard State" which gained over 800,000 views on YouTube.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kingkrule.co.uk/watch-the-video-for-a-lizard-state/ |title=Watch The Video for a Lizard State |publisher=King Krule |date=8 January 2014 |access-date=30 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809213647/http://kingkrule.co.uk/watch-the-video-for-a-lizard-state/ |archive-date=9 August 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In February 2014, King Krule appeared on the cover of ''[[The Fader]]'' in its 90th issue.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thefader.com/2014/02/11/king-krule-god-save-the-king-cover-feature-story-interview/#/0 | title=King Krule: God Save The King | publisher=The FADER | work=The FADER | date=11 February 2014| access-date=3 July 2014}}</ref>

In December 2015, under the name Archy Marshall, he released an album titled ''A New Place 2 Drown'', which includes 12 songs, a 208-page book of visual art and text and a ten-minute documentary. He partnered with his brother, Jack Marshall, on this project.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://pigeonsandplanes.com/in-depth/2015/12/king-krule-didnt-know-new-place-drown/593849|title=593849 - 10 Things You Didn't Know About King Krule|work=PigeonsandPlanes|access-date=2017-11-10|language=en}}</ref> In an interview with NPR, Marshall said that he wanted the album to have a physical component, as well as something for the eyes and the ears.<ref name="npr every day"/> He released the album under the name Archy Marshall rather than King Krule to differentiate between the two different genres of music, as he claims that he thought of ''A New Place 2 Drown'' as a hip hop album rather than the dark alternative/[[jazz]] sound of ''6 Feet Beneath the Moon.''<ref name="npr every day"/>

Marshall took to NTS Radio, hosted by Mount Kimbie, and released two songs under the name Edgar the Beatmaker. The first song is untitled, and the second is titled "When and Why".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/04/archy-marshall-debuts-two-new-songs-on-mount-kimbies-radio-show-listen/|title=Archy Marshall debuts two new songs on Mount Kimbie's radio show — listen|date=2017-04-20|work=Consequence of Sound|access-date=2017-10-26|language=en-US}}</ref> In August 2017, Marshall released a new song entitled "Czech One".

On 8 March 2018 a live performance of songs from "The Ooz" was uploaded to the Molten Jets youtube channel, titled "King Krule - Live from the moon". This performance consisted of 8 different songs and was directed by Ja Humby.

==Musical style and influences==
Many reviewers and journalists have noted King Krule's unusual transcendence and appropriation of disparate genres. His music has been described mainly with jazz derivatives such as [[punk jazz]]<ref name="latimes"/> and [[jazz fusion]],<ref name="latimes"/> but also as [[darkwave]],<ref name="zoo"/> [[post-punk]] and [[hip hop music|hip hop]].<ref name="big">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.bigtakeover.com/recordings/king-krule-6-feet-beneath-the-moon|title=King Krule – 6 Feet Beneath The Moon|last=Morocco|first=AJ|date=7 September 2013|magazine=Big Takeover|access-date=15 January 2014}}</ref> Writers have also noted elements of [[trip hop]],<ref name="latimes">{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-review-king-krule-spooky-angry-musings-fonda-20131219,0,3310150.story#axzz2oL5a3xyQ|title=Review: King Krule's spooky, angry musings at the Fonda|newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|last=Brown|first=August|date=19 December 2013|access-date=23 December 2013}}</ref><ref name="big"/><ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/6-feet-beneath-the-moon-mw0002560697|website=[[Allmusic]]|title=6 Feet Beneath the Moon|last=Lymangrover|first=Jason|access-date=15 January 2014}}</ref> [[jazz rap]] and [[dub music|dub]] in some of his songs.<ref name="guardian">{{cite news|title=King Krule: 6 Feet Beneath the Moon – review|work=Guardian.co.uk|date=17 August 2013|access-date=15 January 2014|author=Kitty Empire|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/18/king-krule-6-feet-moon}}</ref> Jason Lymangrover of [[Allmusic]] states that his songs are mainly in the form of [[ballad]]s with [[major seventh]] chords, but by contrast there is also a "grittiness" to Archy's voice and persona, portraying him as "the type of kid who would be quick to throw a punch without asking questions."<ref name="allmusic"/>

His music has been likened to [[Morrissey]] and [[Edwyn Collins]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sixthformstyle.co.uk/tag/sixth-form-bands/ |title=New Music – Zoo Kid |website=Sixthformstyle.co.uk |date=28 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023011830/http://sixthformstyle.co.uk/tag/sixth-form-bands/ |archive-date=23 October 2010 }}</ref> He is inspired by disparate influences such as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Gene Vincent]], [[Josef K (band)|Josef K]], [[Chet Baker]], [[Fela Kuti]], [[J Dilla]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[Aztec Camera]] (his godfather is the band's former drummer, Dave Ruffy) and [[The Penguin Cafe Orchestra]].<ref name="zoo">{{cite web|url=http://houseanxietyrecords.bigcartel.com/product/zoo-kid-out-getting-ribs-has-this-hit-7 |title=HA0004 – Zoo Kid "Out Getting Ribs"/"Has This Hit" 7" |publisher=House Anxiety Records |date=28 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227002740/http://houseanxietyrecords.bigcartel.com/product/zoo-kid-out-getting-ribs-has-this-hit-7 |archive-date=27 February 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=NardwuarServiette|title=Nardwuar vs. King Krule|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgOd8QG0Gn8&t=5s|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref> Marshall said in an interview with [[The Guardian]] that he began his musical career with the influence of [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]] and [[The Libertines]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/24/king-krule-interview |title=King Krule: 'Basically, I hated everyone'|newspaper=The Guardian|date=24 August 2013|access-date=17 February 2019}}</ref>

Marshall's lyrics, according to a ''[[Flaunt]]'' magazine interview, generally consist of romance, sex, aggression, conflict, and depression. These themes link to his literary influences, in which Marshall further elaborated: "Literature, poems, songs are all very similar[.] I used to read lots of poetry and sit there for ages trying to decipher the meaning, or work out the narration behind it all, then I found my own form of that. [...] you can see how their metaphors develop and understand their uses. So really, I learnt to do that for myself."<ref>{{cite web |title=King Krule |url=https://www.flaunt.com/content/music/king-krule |website=[[Flaunt]] |access-date=10 November 2019 |date=14 October 2013}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Marshall is in a relationship with English photographer Charlotte Patmore. Patmore has been a collaborator with him on photography and videography projects for several years, and has been involved with several of his music videos, including the video for the song "Cadet Limbo", which Patmore directed.<ref name="Cadet Limbo: Archy & Charlotte">{{cite web |last1=Garcia |first1=Francisco |title=WePresent:It's like a road movie.
