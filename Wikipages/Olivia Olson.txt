They had to train her so her singing would sound more believable, and add the sounds of inhalations to the track.<ref name="ew2009" /> This led to guest spots on ''[[The Ellen Show]]'', ''[[The Tracy Morgan Show]]'' and singing with stars [[Jack Black]] and [[Kristin Chenoweth]]. Olson also posted original songs on her [[YouTube]] account. In 2017, Olson voiced Joanna in ''[[Red Nose Day Actually]]'', a short film which is a sequel to ''Love Actually''.<ref name="hough2021" />
