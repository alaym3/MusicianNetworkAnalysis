'''Band of Horses''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 2004 in [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]] by [[Ben Bridwell]]. The band has released five studio albums, including 2010's Grammy-nominated ''[[Infinite Arms]]''.<ref name=grammy/> The band's lineup, which included [[Mat Brooke]] for the debut album, has undergone several changes. The most-recent lineup of Bridwell, Ryan Monroe, [[Tyler Ramsey]], Bill Reynolds, and Creighton Barrett, was together several years and recorded three albums.  That lineup ceased when Ramsey and Reynolds departed in 2017.<ref name=Ramsey>{{cite web|url=https://instagram.com/p/BTkpU6wg2y1/|title=Saying farewell after 10 years to the band of horses.|last=Ramsey|first=Tyler|publisher=Instagram|date=May 1, 2017|access-date=May 2, 2017}}</ref><ref name=Reynolds>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/BillReynoldsMusic/posts/1168049576637959:0|title=I'd like to thank all the beautiful folks I have met out there on the road with Band of Horses.|last=Reynolds|first=Bill|publisher=Facebook|date=May 2, 2017|access-date=May 2, 2017}}</ref>

==History==

===Formation and ''Everything All the Time'' (2004–2006)===
Ben Bridwell (vocals, guitar) formed Band of Horses, who were originally briefly known as Horses, in 2004 after the break-up of his previous band, [[Carissa's Wierd]], along with bassist Chris Early and drummer Tim Meinig. They were soon joined by former Carissa's Wierd bandleader Mat Brooke (guitar, vocals).<ref>Tom Scanlon, [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/musicnightlife/2003157061_nite28.html For Band of Horses, Block Party is just one stop in whirlwind year] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622034958/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/musicnightlife/2003157061_nite28.html |date=June 22, 2011 }} ''[[The Seattle Times|Seattle Times]]'' – July 28, 2006</ref> The band initially received attention from [[Sub Pop]] after opening for [[Iron & Wine]] during [[Seattle]] area shows. In 2005, the band released the ''[[Tour EP (Band of Horses)|Tour EP]]'', which was sold at shows and on Sub Pop's website.

Their first full-length album, ''[[Everything All the Time]]'', was recorded in 2005 with producer [[Phil Ek]] and released by Sub Pop on March 21, 2006. It features the band's original four-piece lineup, although both Tim Meinig and [[Sera Cahoone]] receive drumming credits.<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r821786|pure_url=yes}} ''Everything All The Time'', Credits] ''Allmusic''</ref> The album included new versions of five of the six songs from the ''Tour EP'' along with five brand new songs. It was a minor hit in Scandinavia, entering the lower reaches of the Sweden and Norway album charts.<ref name=EATTU>[http://www.ultratop.be/nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Band+Of+Horses&titel=Everything+All+The+Time&cat=a ''Everything All the Time'' Ultratop entry] – ''[[Ultratop]]''</ref> Ben Bridwell explained the sound of the album, "I thought before recording that I really wanted an [[Electric Light Orchestra|ELO]]-sounding record, with strings and keyboards and synths, but then, as we got closer to it, we wanted to take a more raw approach."<ref>Matt Ryan, [http://www.magnetmagazine.com/2006/07/23/band-of-horses-confidence-men/ Band Of Horses: Confidence Men] ''[[Magnet (magazine)|Magnet]]'' – July 23, 2006</ref>

Bridwell found that there was a personality clash between himself and Meinig and Early and the two left soon after the recording of the album. Ben explained his side of the story, "All of a sudden I was...with two guys I didn't really even know...they were nice guys, there just wasn't a personality match."<ref>Jonny Cazzola, [http://www.fusedmagazine.com/2008/10/15/band-of-horses-interview/ Music: Band of Horses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719014629/http://www.fusedmagazine.com/2008/10/15/band-of-horses-interview/ |date=July 19, 2011 }} ''[[Fused Magazine]]'' – October 15, 2008</ref> For the subsequent tour, Joe Arnone (guitar and keyboards), Rob Hampton (bass and guitar) and Creighton Barrett (drums) were brought in to play with Bridwell and Brooke.

''Everything All the Time''{{'}}s first single was "[[The Funeral (Band of Horses song)|The Funeral]]", which has been used in numerous television series, films, video games, and advertisements. On July 13, 2006, the band performed the song on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' without Brooke, who had left the band.<ref>Justin Sheppard, [http://www.prefixmag.com/news/band-of-horses/7903/ Band of Horses loses Mat Brooke] ''prefixmag.com'' – July 26, 2006</ref> Subsequently, he formed [[Grand Archives]], who have since signed to [[Sub Pop]] and released two albums. Brooke explained how he joined Band of Horses, "So they ended up getting a show opening up for Iron and Wine in Seattle and Ben asked if I would just come up and do a couple songs, just 'cause we're friends. So...I did that. It was fun and then a couple of Iron and Wine tours came up...and then next thing I knew, we were in the studio making a record for Sub Pop." On why he left, he said, "I'd never really given the commitment to be a formal member. It was just a spur of the moment...and ''Everything All the Time'' took off really fast...I still didn't feel quite committed. It was still 100 percent Ben's project and I kinda wanted to see what else I could do."<ref>Stephen Seigel, [http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/volume-and-vigor/Content?oid=1091640 Volume and Vigor] ''[[Tucson Weekly]]'' – June 19, 2008</ref>

Band of Horses toured Europe and North America in 2007, prior to the release of their second album. Joe Arnone was no longer part of the band, which now toured as a six-piece band following the addition of Matt Gentling ([[Archers of Loaf]] – bass), Robin Peringer ([[Modest Mouse]], Carissa's Wierd – guitar) and Ryan Monroe (keyboards) to the line up. The album, ''[[Cease to Begin]]'', was recorded in [[North Carolina]] and produced by Phil Ek. It was released by Sub Pop Records on October 9, 2007.

Following the release of ''Cease to Begin'', Monroe became a permanent member of the band, along with new recruits Tyler Ramsey (guitar and vocals) and Bill Reynolds (bass). This once again made Band of Horses a six-piece band. In addition to his role in the band, Ramsey often performed solo as the opening act before the band play live.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}

This song is so nostalgic to me as my parents grew up in Atlanta and have so many family members in the great state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. It's always been a second home of sorts.
