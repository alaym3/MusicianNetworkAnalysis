{{lang|de|'''Einstürzende Neubauten'''|italic=no}} ({{IPA-de|ˈaɪnˌʃtʏʁtsn̩də ˈnɔʏˌbaʊtn̩}}, {{lit}} "Collapsing New Buildings") is a German [[experimental music]] group, originally formed in [[West Berlin]] in 1980. The group is currently composed of founder members [[Blixa Bargeld]] (lead vocals; guitar; keyboard) and [[N.U. Unruh]] ([[Experimental musical instrument|custom-made instrument]]s; [[Percussion instrument|percussion]]; vocals), long-time contributor [[Alexander Hacke]] (bass; vocals), plus Jochen Arbeit (guitar; vocals), and [[Rudolf Moser]] (custom-built instruments; percussion; vocals), who both joined the line-up in 1997.

One of their trademarks is the use of custom-built instruments, predominantly made out of scrap metal and building tools, and noises, in addition to standard musical instruments. Their early albums were unremittingly harsh, with Bargeld's vocals shouted and screamed above a din of banging and scraping metal percussion. Subsequent recordings found the group's sound growing somewhat more conventional, yet still containing many unorthodox elements.

==History==
===1980s===
On 1 April 1980, {{lang|de|Einstürzende Neubauten|italic=no}} made their first appearance, at the Moon Club in [[West Berlin]].<ref name=bio>{{cite web | url=http://www.neubauten.org/biography | title=Biography: Einstürzende Neubauten|website=Neubauten.org | access-date=22 May 2012}}</ref> This first lineup featured Beate Bartel and [[Gudrun Gut]], [[Blixa Bargeld]], and [[N.U. Unruh]]. The two female members, Bartel and Gut, left the band after a short period and founded [[Mania&nbsp;D]]. Shortly thereafter, [[Alexander Hacke]] (alias Alexander von Borsig), a sound technician and multi-instrumentalist who was 15 years old at the time, joined the band and became a longtime member.

In 1981, percussionist [[F.M. Einheit]] (from the [[Hamburg]] band {{lang|de|[[Abwärts]]}}) joined {{lang|de|Einstürzende Neubauten|italic=no}} and they released their first [[LP (format)|LP]], {{lang|de|[[Kollaps]]}} ("''Collapse''"),<ref name=bio/> a mixture of rough [[punk rock|punk]] tunes and industrial noises. The industrial noises were obtained from self-made music machines, electronics, and [[found object]]s such as metal plates. The live performances with Einheit in the 1980s included much metal banging and destruction on stage.

During their first German tour, [[Mark Chung (musician)|Mark Chung]] (previously the bass player with {{lang|de|[[Abwärts]]}}) joined the group of musicians.<ref name=bio/> This lineup lasted nearly 15 years.

In 1983, {{lang|de|Einstürzende Neubauten|italic=no}} recorded their second album, {{lang|de|[[Zeichnungen des Patienten O. T.]]}} ("''Drawings of Patient O.T.''").<ref name=bio/> The title came from a 1974 book by [[Leo Navratil]], describing the drawings of [[Oswald Tschirtner]]. It was also a guest performer on [[Fad Gadget]]'s "Collapsing New People" 7" single's B-side track ''Spoil The Child'', recorded at [[Hansa Tonstudio]], Berlin in November 1983.

Also in 1983, Bargeld joined the band [[The Birthday Party (band)|The Birthday Party]] (featuring [[Nick Cave]] and [[Mick Harvey]]) as a guitarist. That group soon disbanded, but Bargeld became a longtime member of one of the bands that sprang from it, [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]] (again featuring Cave and Harvey). Bargeld remained a full-time member of both {{lang|de|Einstürzende Neubauten|italic=no}} and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds until 2003, when he quit the Bad Seeds in order to focus on {{lang|de|Einstürzende Neubauten|italic=no}}.

In 1984, {{lang|de|Einstürzende Neubauten|italic=no}}, with guests including [[Genesis P-Orridge]], [[Stevo Pearce]], [[Fad Gadget|Frank Tovey]] and others, played a show titled ''The Concerto for Voices and Machinery'' at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|ICA]] in London. After 20 minutes the venue halted the show when the band began to dig through the venue's stage with drills and jackhammers.{{sfn|Neal|1987|pp=52, 108}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/feb/16/popandrock1 |title=How to destroy the ICA with drills |work=The Guardian |date=16 February 2007 |access-date= 10 April 2018}}</ref> 1984 also saw the first release of a best-of and rarities compilation, ''[[Strategies Against Architecture '80–'83]]''.

The band's next album, {{lang|de|[[Halber Mensch]]}} ("''Half Man''") in 1985,<ref name=bio/> may be seen as a developmental breakthrough. Musical structure became more evident, and Bargeld's lyrics and, especially, his singing changed. He moved from shouted words and phrases toward organized, poetic melodies.

The band played a show in [[Vancouver]], Canada, to kick off its third North American tour. The performance was sponsored by the German [[Goethe-Institut|Goethe Institute]] as part of the German contribution to ''[[Expo 86]]''. Also scheduled to appear were [[Test Dept]] and [[Skinny Puppy]], though not everyone was able to play.

On the tour, the group's experimental and improvised live performance style occasionally caused difficulties with venue management and law enforcement. A performance at [[The Palladium (club)|The Palladium]] in [[Manhattan]] ended after an improvised [[pyrotechnics]] display. The band ignited lighter fluid in a couple of metal pans, and management stopped the performance and cleared the venue.<ref>{{cite magazine| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B_38rmDqlLQC&pg=PA72|department=86'D: The Year Done Dirt Cheap|title=Einstürzende Neubauten set fire to New York Disco | first1=Glenn | last1=O'Brien | first2=Scott | last2=Cohen | first3=John | last3=Leland | magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] | volume=2 | issue=10 | date=January 1987 |page=72| access-date=22 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZTvrK1F34FAC&q=einsturzende+neubauten+palladium+fire&pg=PA227 | chapter=Einstürzende Neubauten | title=The Show I'll Never Forget: 50 Writers Relive Their Most Memorable Concertgoing Experience | editor=Manning, Sean | author=Estep, Maggie | page=227 | year=2007 | isbn=9780786734443 | access-date=22 May 2012}}</ref>

The one-hour film [[Halber Mensch (film)|''Halber Mensch'']] (1986) by [[Sōgo Ishii]] documents {{lang|de|Einstürzende Neubauten|italic=no}}'s visit to Japan in 1985. The next two albums, {{lang|de|[[Fünf auf der nach oben offenen Richterskala]]}} ("''Five on the open-ended Richterscale''") in 1987<ref name=bio/> and {{lang|de|[[Haus der Lüge]]}} ("''House of the Lie''") in 1989,<ref name=bio/> were great successes in the United States and Japan.

===1990s===
In 1990, the band tried something completely new, recording the soundtrack for East German playwright [[Heiner Müller|Heiner Müller's]] play {{lang|de|[[Die Hamletmaschine]]}} ("''The Hamlet Machine''") for East German radio {{lang|de|Rundfunk der DDR}}.<ref>{{lang|de|Die Hamletmaschine von Heiner Müller}}, Rough Trade Records, 1991</ref> <!-- The DDR ceased to exist in 1990. What's this about? -->The band image of {{lang|de|Einstürzende Neubauten|italic=no}} changed: Blixa Bargeld, formerly wearing punk/industrial style clothes, appeared at the live concerts in a suit.

1991 also saw the release of the double album, a best-of and rarities album, ''[[Strategies Against Architecture II]]''. This collection included a musical setting of [[Heiner Müller]]'s piece {{lang|de|Bildbeschreibung}} ("''Explosion of a Memory''" or "''Description of a Picture''").

In [[Vienna]], May 1992, {{lang|de|Einstürzende Neubauten|italic=no}} performed at [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna|The Academy of Fine Arts]]' 300th anniversary in a show by Erich Wonder, {{lang|de|Das Auge des Taifun}} ("''The eye of the typhoon''").

The next album, ''[[Tabula Rasa (Einstürzende Neubauten album)|Tabula Rasa]]'' (1993),<ref name=bio/> was an important turning point in the band's history, the music becoming softer and containing more electronic sounds.

In 1993, the band was booked to support [[U2]] during the European leg of the [[Zoo TV Tour]], but were thrown off the stage and off the tour when a band member threw an iron bar into the booing crowd.<ref>{{cite book | title = U2 Live: A Concert Documentary | first = Pimm Jal | last = de la Parra | year = 2003 | publisher = [[Omnibus Press]] | isbn = 0-7119-9198-7|pages=162}}</ref>

[[Mark Chung (musician)|Mark Chung]] left the band in 1994 after the recording of {{lang|de|Faustmusik}} for [[Werner Schwab]]'s play, and made a career in the music industry. [[F.M. Einheit]], who contributed much to the music and sound of the band, left the band a short time later in 1995, during the recording of the {{lang|de|Ende Neu}} album, at least partially because of a conflict with Bargeld. The last {{lang|de|Einstürzende Neubauten}} track Einheit worked on was {{lang|de|Was ist ist}}.<ref>see the booklet for ''[[Strategies Against Architecture III]]''</ref> [[Roland Wolf (musician)|Roland Wolf]] replaced them on bass guitar and keyboards only a short time before dying in a car accident in 1995.

A short time later, the band released the album {{lang|de|[[Ende Neu]]}} ("''Ending New''") in 1996.<ref name=bio/> The title is wordplay on the band's own name (i.e. "{{lang|de|Einstürz'''ende Neu'''bauten|italic=no}}"). The song ''Stella Maris'' – a duet between Bargeld and Hacke's then-wife, singer [[Meret Becker]] – became quite famous; a world tour followed the release. During this time, Jochen Arbeit and [[Rudi Moser]] (both members of {{lang|de|[[Die Haut]]}}) joined the band: Arbeit on guitar, and Moser on drums, with Hacke switching to bass guitar. This lineup, accompanied by [[Ash Wednesday (musician)|Ash Wednesday]] on keyboards for live concerts, has held ever since.

[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]] included Einstürzende Neubauten in their 1996 list of "100 underground inspirations of the past 20 years."<ref name="ap-11-100-1996">{{cite journal |last1=DeMarco |first1=Laura |editor=Michael Shea |title=100 Underground Inspirations of the Past 20 Years |journal=Alternative Press |date=1996 |volume=11 |issue=100 |pages=39-56 |publisher=Alternative Press Magazine, Inc. |location=Cleveland, OH |issn=1065 1667}}</ref>

In 1997, the album ''{{lang|de|Ende Neu}} Remixes'' was released, which featured remixes of the songs from {{lang|de|Ende Neu}} by artists such as [[Barry Adamson]], [[Pan Sonic]] and Darkus (alias [[Mark Rutherford (composer)|Mark Rutherford]]); Darkus's remix tracks, with others not included on ''{{lang|de|Ende Neu}} Remixes'', were made available separately in the same year on ''The NNNAAAMMM Remixes By Darkus'' release.

===2000s===
[[File:EN 2000-05-19 Karlsruhe 1.jpg|thumb|Live at "Tollhaus" in [[Karlsruhe]], May 2000: [[Alexander Hacke]] (left) and [[Blixa Bargeld]] (right)]]

From 27 March to 23 May 2000, {{lang|de|Einstürzende Neubauten|italic=no}} celebrated their 20th birthday with a "20th anniversary tour", playing in the Columbiahalle, [[Berlin]] on its birthday, 1 April, and released the album ''[[Silence Is Sexy]]'',<ref name=bio/> followed by a world tour. 2001 also saw the release of another double best-of and rarities album, ''[[Strategies Against Architecture III]]''.

Since 2001, {{lang|de|Einstürzende Neubauten|italic=no}} albums and web projects have been partially produced and supported by Bargeld's wife, Erin Zhu, who also serves as webmaster of {{lang|de|Einstürzende Neubauten|italic=no}}'s website.

In 2002, {{lang|de|Einstürzende Neubauten|italic=no}} began work on a new album without the backing of a record label, relying instead upon fan ("supporter") participation in an experiment of a type of [[Street Performer Protocol]] combined with an internet community and touches of the [[patronage]] system. An exclusive ''[[Supporter Album No.&nbsp;1]]'', and the ''[[Airplane Miniatures]]'' EP following, were made available in 2003.

Bargeld left [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]] in 2003. In order to go on tour, the band reneged on the idea of creating a supporter-only album, and cooperated with [[Mute Records]] to go on tour and release ''[[Perpetuum Mobile (album)|Perpetuum Mobile]]'' in 2004.<ref name=bio/> Air sounds, such as blowing the plastic pipes with an air compressor, were greatly explored and used for this album: the working title of the album was, for a long while, {{lang|de|Luftveränderung}} ("''Change of air''").
A half-hour documentary about the supporters project, {{lang|de|Traumfestival}}, was made by [[Ste van Holm]] and Dihcar, and is available on YouTube.

The live shows of the ''Perpetuum Mobile'' Tour were recorded by the band's sound engineers, then burned on CDRs with individual pictures of each show taken by [[Danielle de Picciotto]] and sold directly after the concerts; numerous "official" live albums were created during this tour as a result.

In November 2004, the band went on a mini-tour, which included a supporters-only performance at Berlin's {{lang|de|[[Palast der Republik]]}}. The performance was filmed and coordinated by [[Danielle de Picciotto]] and Ian Williamson and released on the exclusive supporter's DVD at the end of Phase II.

The band also started a new project called {{lang|de|Musterhaus}} in early 2005. The first CD, {{lang|de|[[Anarchitektur]]}}, was sent out in May 2005, and was also available for download to {{lang|de|Musterhaus}} subscribers. The {{lang|de|Musterhaus}} project was a "line of releases intended to give the band an outlet for more experimental impulses and exploration." {{lang|de|Musterhaus}} albums were released roughly every 3 months.

The second {{lang|de|Musterhaus}} CD, {{lang|de|Unglaublicher Lärm}} ("''Incredible noise''"), was finished on 15 August, and shipped out (as well as posted for download) shortly after.

Phase II of the {{lang|de|Neubauten|italic=no}} Supporter's project finished in August 2005, and the official site was taken down on 20 September. The supporter album {{lang|de|[[Grundstück]]}} ("''Plot of Land''") and DVD (containing footage from the November 2004 {{lang|de|Grundstück}} performance in Berlin) was shipped in early October 2005.

''{{lang|de|Musterhaus}} No.&nbsp;3 {{lang|de|[[Solo Bassfeder]]}}'' ("''Solo bass-spring''"), released 8 December, is a collection of bass spring compositions by the individual members of {{lang|de|Einstürzende Neubauten|italic=no}}.

Phase III of the Supporter's project started on 10 February. On 25 February, the fourth part of the {{lang|de|Musterhaus}} series, ''[[Redux Orchestra versus Einstürzende Neubauten]]'', was completed. One of the new additions to Phase III started in March 2006 was a piece-by-piece album, ''[[Jewels (Einstürzende Neubauten album)|Jewels]]'', finally finished in August 2007.

Danielle de Picciotto, Alexander Hacke's wife and longtime companion, released the DVD documentary ''{{lang|de|Einstürzende Neubauten}} - On tour with {{lang|de|neubauten}}.org'' which describes the supporter project in detail, having interviewed international supporters during the Perpetuum Mobile tour in 2004.
 
''{{lang|de|Musterhaus}} No.&nbsp;5 {{lang|de|[[Kassetten]]}}'' ("''Cassettes''"), finished 15 May with release scheduled for 31 May. At the same time, {{lang|de|[[Alles was irgendwie nützt]]}} ("''Everything of any use''"), an album that had been in the work since Phase 2, were completed. The album consists of rare live tracks, handpicked by 6 supporters of Phase 2 and mixed by Boris Wilsdorf. This was quickly followed by ''{{lang|de|Musterhaus}} No.&nbsp;6'' {{lang|de|[[Klaviermusik]]}} ("''Piano music''"), released on 31 August.

In October, Neubauten released a public DVD, the recording made at {{lang|de|Palast der Republik}}.

''{{lang|de|Musterhaus}} No.&nbsp;7 {{lang|de|[[Stimmen Reste]]}}'' ("''Voice Remainders''") was released on 2 December, consisting of vocal experiments, vocal recordings, and manipulations of voice recordings, enriched with leftover instrumental tracks made with polystyrene, electronic pulses, Hammond organ, bass guitar, and metal percussion.

It was announced on the band's website that it would be undertaking a "small (mostly) [[United Kingdom|UK]] tour" in April 2007, but playing in [[Hannover]] on 22 April beforehand. ''{{lang|de|Musterhaus}} No.&nbsp;8 {{lang|de|[[Weingeister]]}}'' ("''Wine spirits''") was released on 6 April, forming the final instalment of the {{lang|de|Musterhaus}} series.

A new commercial album was made available later in the year,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=25428_0_2_0_C|title=Einstürzende Neubauten to launch new album and tour|website=Side-line.com|access-date=1 December 2017}}</ref> the first release since 2004's ''Perpetuum Mobile''. The new album, {{lang|de|[[Alles wieder offen]]}} ("''All open again''"), was released in 2007<ref name=bio/> without the backing of a label, a move the band had intended to make with ''Perpetuum Mobile''. Fans who were part of the paid EN community at neubauten.org received access to an album with the same tracks plus a number of extra songs, and an optional DVD about the making of the album. The band also filmed a video for "Nagorny Karabach".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=27094_0_2_0_C|title=Behind-the-scenes look of Einsturzende Neubauten video 'Nagorny Karabach'|website=Side-line.com|access-date=1 December 2017}}</ref> They spent the first half of 2008 touring for the album, playing 32 dates in 19 European countries.

{{lang|de|Einstürzende Neubauten|italic=no}} celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2010 with a tour through Europe. An American leg was also planned, but on 29 November 2010 the band announced the cancellation of all U.S. dates due to visa scheduling problems.<ref>{{cite web|title=Einstürzende Neubauten cancel anniversary performances|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2010/11/einsturzende_ne_1.html|publisher=[[Brooklyn Vegan]]|date=29 November 2010|access-date=30 November 2010}}</ref>

''[[Silence Is Sexy]]'' was reissued on 1 July 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://neubauten.org/silenceissexy|title=Silence is Sexy &#124; Einstürzende Neubauten|website=Neubauten.org|access-date=13 October 2019}}</ref>

In May 2014, the band announced on their official website that it was back in the studio working on new material. It also announced dates for live shows to be held in November 2014. The album ''[[Lament (Einstürzende Neubauten album)|Lament]]'' was released on 7 November.<ref name="LamentEN">{{cite web |url=http://www.neubauten.org/lament |title=Lament |access-date=12 October 2014 |website=Neubauten.org}}</ref>

=== 2020s ===
{{Update|section|date=July 2020}}

In November 2019, the band announced on their official website that they would release a new studio album in 2020 and accompanying tour.<ref>{{cite web |title=NEW ALBUM AND THE YEAR OF THE RAT TOUR 2020 |url=https://neubauten.org/en/news |website=neubauten.org |access-date=7 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191107090855/https://neubauten.org/en/news |archive-date=7 November 2019 |date=4 November 2019}}</ref> The album, titled ''Alles in Allem'', would release on 15 May 2020.

==Band name==
The band name is usually translated into English as "Collapsing New Buildings". {{lang|de|Neubauten}} ("''new buildings''") is a general term referring to buildings constructed in Germany after 1945. These are often regarded as cheaper, flimsier, and less aesthetically attractive than {{lang|de|Altbauten}}, or pre-1945, especially pre-[[modernism|modernist]] buildings. Due to the extensive destruction throughout Germany during the [[Second World War]], and the extensive rebuilding thereafter, {{lang|de|Neubauten}} constitute a very familiar element of German cities.

The band's name attracted unexpected attention when on 21 May 1980, not two months after the band's forming, the roof of the [[Haus der Kulturen der Welt|Berlin Congress Hall]] famously collapsed, killing one person and injuring many. The resulting media attention surrounding the collapse of the German-American icon gave the meaning of their name a new dimension.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nick-cave.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=375&Itemid=38|title=Nick Cave Online - EINSTUERZENDE NEUBAUTEN - BIOGRAPHY|website=Nick-cave.com|access-date=1 December 2017}}</ref>

[[File:Einstürzende Neubauten logo.png|thumb|upright|[[Einstürzende Neubauten logo|The band logo]], sourced from [[prehistoric art]] based on a [[petroglyph]] [[cave drawing]]]] 
The [[Einstürzende Neubauten logo]] resembles a human [[stick figure]] with two arms, two legs (one shorter than the other), thin body and big round head consisting of a [[circled dot]]. It was not created by or for the band, but is a [[cave drawing]] of probably [[Toltec]] or [[Olmec]] origin, though its provenance has also been attributed to the much older sacred ring at [[Stonehenge]].<ref>Einstürzende Neubauten, Stampa Alternativa/Nuovi Equilibri, Roma, IT. {{ISBN|88-7226-101-5}} (IT,1993)</ref>
Singers [[Henry Rollins]], [[Joakim Thåström]], [[Gareth Liddiard]] and [[Alexis S.F. Marshall]] all have the {{lang|de|Einstürzende Neubauten}} logo tattooed.
