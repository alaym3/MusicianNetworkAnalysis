'''Kathleen Troccoli''' (born June 24, 1958) is an American [[contemporary Christian music]] singer, songwriter, author, and speaker.

== Early life and family ==

Born in [[Brooklyn]], New York, Troccoli was raised  in [[Islip Terrace, New York|Islip Terrace, Long Island, New York]],<ref>Troccoli, 2001, p.5.</ref> where she graduated from East Islip High School. Her father died of [[colon cancer]] when she was 15; her mother died of breast cancer in 1991, shortly before the release of her album ''Pure Attraction'' and its mainstream chart selection, "Everything Changes".

Troccoli was raised in a Catholic family, which was not particularly religious.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/troccoli-kathy|title=Troccoli, Kathy - Dictionary definition of Troccoli, Kathy {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=October 31, 2017}}</ref> As of 1998, she was a practicing Roman Catholic, but currently identifies as a non-denominational Christian. As of 2020, she continues to sing, speak and minister to the Church worldwide.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/time_is_right_for_catholic_music_with_pop_appeal|title=Time Is Right for Catholic Music With Pop Appeal|date= March 8, 1998|work=National Catholic Register|access-date=October 31, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://joymag.co.za/article/kathy-troccoli-singing-for-the-king/|title=Kathy Troccoli: Singing For The King – JOY!}}</ref>

== Musical career ==

After graduating from high school, Troccoli studied jazz and opera at the [[Berklee College of Music]] in [[Boston]] for a year, then returned to Long Island to major in voice at [[Suffolk County Community College]] (SCCC) also singing with a SCCC-based jazz band and later singing in Long Island clubs. In the summer of 1978, while working a "day job"{{Clarify|date=May 2017}} to help cover her college expenses, Troccoli formed a friendship with a [[born again|born again Christian]] co-worker; this led to Troccoli herself becoming a devout Christian. Troccoli's [[alto]] voice gained prominence when she opened for Ed Nalle's group, [[Glad (band)|GLAD]], when the group performed at the Long Island church Troccoli attended in 1980. Approximately six months afterwards, Nalle invited Troccoli to record a [[demo (music)|demo tape]], with his band's backing, and Kathy accepted. After she and GLAD had recorded it, the tape was submitted to Michael Blanton and Dan Harrell ([[Amy Grant]]'s brother-in-law); these two, as a result of hearing it, formed the Reunion Records label, in [[Nashville]], specifically to record Troccoli, and Kathy herself, in turn, moved to Nashville to reside with Harrell and his family.<ref name="Todays Christian Music">{{cite web|url=http://www.todayschristianmusic.com/artists/kathy-troccoli/features/kt-on-her-way-up/|title=Todays Christian Music - 24/7 Christian Music Streamed Free!|first=Timothy J.|last=Trudeau|website=www.todayschristianmusic.com}}</ref>

Troccoli's debut album, the 1982 release ''Stubborn Love'', was reportedly the best-selling debut album by a contemporary Christian music female artist. A second album, ''Heart and Soul'', was released in 1984; it led to her receiving her first [[Grammy]] nomination a year later, in 1986, in which year ''Images'' followed it. Troccoli then withdrew from her musical career returning to Long Island for a six-year sojourn, giving singing lessons and sang at weddings.<ref name="Tulsa World">{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/kathy-troccoli-won-t-compromise-her-music-crossover-artist-stubborn/article_633eb7d4-793d-55ee-be8b-27ee1f2ff7b1.html|title=Kathy Troccoli Won't Compromise Her Music // Crossover Artist Stubborn About Goals|first=Samuel|last=Autman}}</ref><ref name="Encyclopedia.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/troccoli-kathy|title=Troccoli, Kathy - Dictionary definition of Troccoli, Kathy - Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}</ref> In 1989, Troccoli was prominently featured on the selection "[[I'll Be Your Shelter]]", a [[Diane Warren]]-penned song which [[Taylor Dayne]] recorded for her album ''[[Can't Fight Fate]].'' "I'll Be Your Shelter" became a Top Ten single in 1990.<ref name="You’ve Got a Friend in Kathy Troccoli">{{cite web|url=http://www1.cbn.com/music/you&rsquo;ve-got-a-friend-in-kathy-troccoli|title=You've Got a Friend in Kathy Troccoli|website=CBN.com (beta)}}</ref>

After her mother's death, Troccoli returned to the Reunion Records label in 1991 for her secular album debut, ''Pure Attraction'', whose lead single, "Everything Changes", Warren had written and composed for Taylor Dayne. Dayne had turned the selection down, however,<ref name="You’ve Got a Friend in Kathy Troccoli"/> and [[Joe Galante]], then president of [[RCA Records]], through which Reunion releases were distributed, offered it to Troccoli, who recalled: "He played it, and I knew I could own it. This was something I wanted to say."<ref name="Encyclopedia.com"/> Peaking at No. 14 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', "Everything Changes" also charted on the magazine's [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary chart]] reaching No. 6.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicvf.com/song.php?title=Everything+Changes+by+Kathy+Troccoli&id=23901|title=Everything Changes (song by Kathy Troccoli) ••• Music VF, US & UK hits charts|website=www.musicvf.com}}</ref> "Help Myself To You" became Troccoli's first No. 1 hit in her ten-year career, and began a string of [[GMA Music Awards]] nominations, including numerous attempts at Female Vocalist.

Numerous hit songs came afterwards, including 1994's "My Life is in Your Hands", jointly written and composed with Bill Montvilo, which defined her career and inspired the devotional book of the same title, written in 1997, and 1995's "Go Light Your World", which began the rise of writer [[Chris Rice]] and was used for charity efforts that year.

In 1996, Troccoli was featured on the [[Beach Boys]]'s now out-of-print album ''[[Stars and Stripes Vol. 1]]'', singing lead vocals on a cover of their 1969 song "I Can Hear Music", itself a cover of a [[Phil Spector]] song. The Beach Boys sing on the track as well, providing harmonies and backing vocals.

== Media appearances ==

Over the years, Kathy has appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', ''[[Live with Regis and Kathie Lee]]'', ''[[The 700 Club]]'', ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', among others. She also appeared on [[Focus on the Family]]'s video for teens, ''Sex, Lies, & The Truth''.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} She has also been a regular co-host of the TV show "Red Letter Christians" with [[Tony Campolo]]. In 2010, she co-hosted a one-hour television program called ''The Mark and Kathy Show'' with [[Mark Lowry]], on [[The Inspiration Network]] (later called INSP).<ref>{{cite book|last=Powell|first=Mark Allan|title=Encyclopedia of contemporary Christian music|year=2002|publisher=Hendrickson Publishers|location=Peabody, Mass.|isbn=1-56563-679-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco00mark/page/962 962]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco00mark/page/962}}</ref>
