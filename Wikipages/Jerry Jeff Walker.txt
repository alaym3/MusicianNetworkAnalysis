==="Mr. Bojangles"===
Walker's "[[Mr. Bojangles (song)|Mr. Bojangles]]" (1968) is perhaps his best-known and most-often covered song.<ref name=Nash/>  It is about an obscure alcoholic but talented tap-dancing drifter who, when arrested and jailed in New Orleans, insisted on being identified only as "Bojangles" (which happened to be the nickname of famed dancer [[Bill Robinson]], leading to speculation that Robinson was the subject of the song).  In his autobiography, ''Gypsy Songman'', Walker made it clear the man he met was white, which would indicate that Robinson was not the inspiration. Further, in an interview with [[BBC Radio 4]] in August 2008, he pointed out that at the time the jail cells in New Orleans were segregated along color lines, so his influence could not have been black.<ref name="WP obit"/>

[[Mr. Bojangles (song)#Recorded versions|Notable covers of the song]] include a live version by his bandmate Bromberg on his album ''[[Demon in Disguise]]'' and a single by the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] that charted at number 9 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1971 (also released on their album ''[[Uncle Charlie & His Dog Teddy]]'').

==Later years and death==
Walker had an annual birthday celebration in Austin at the [[Paramount Theatre (Austin, Texas)|Paramount Theatre]] and at [[Gruene Hall]] in [[Gruene, Texas]].<ref name=Nash/> This party became an enormous event in Texas and brought some of the biggest names in country music out for a night of picking and swapping stories.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nashville Notes On the road with rabbits, doves, chimp|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/112956004/|page=39|first=Thomas|last=Goldsmith|date=February 13, 1988|access-date=October 26, 2020|newspaper=The Tennessean|location=Nashville, Tennessee}}</ref>  ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' reported in June 2019 that Walker was among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire|2008 Universal Studios fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=June 28, 2019 |date=June 25, 2019}}</ref>
