'''The Indelicates''' are a [[Sussex]]-based English [[indie rock]] band. Formed in 2005 by Julia and Simon Indelicate, the band's songs are known for their mix of dark, cynical lyrics and tuneful rock melodies. The Indelicates came to attention with their early [[demo (music)|demo]]s, which were released for free on their website. The band signed to independent record label Sad Gnome Records in 2006 and released several singles and an EP. After leaving Sad Gnome in 2007, the band signed to another independent label, [[Weekender Records]], which issued their first album, ''American Demo'', in 2008.

After Weekender found itself in financial difficulty, the Indelicates asked to be released from their contract. In 2010, the band formed Corporate Records, through which artists could sell their own work on a [[Pay what you want|pay-what-you-like]] basis and retain the bulk of the profits. The band's first release through the label was ''Songs for Swinging Lovers'' in 2010. Four more albums followed, including the [[concept album]] ''David Koresh Superstar'' in 2011, based on the life of [[Branch Davidian]] religious sect leader [[David Koresh]]. Their most recent album was released in 2017. The Indelicates are also known for their innovative and progressive marketing techniques, including [[crowdfunding]] their fourth album before [[Kickstarter]] had a UK presence, "Super Special Editions", and [[virtual reality]] and [[360-degree video|360-degree music videos]].

The band remain favourites in the [[blogosphere]], but although they received positive notices in the mainstream music press and achieved some popularity in Germany, they have never had a breakout hit. While Simon and Julia have been ever-present, the Indelicates have featured several line-ups since their formation, sometimes with a rotating roster of backing musicians for live shows, which they continue to perform in the UK and Europe.

==Early work==
===Formation===
The Indelicates were formed in 2005 in [[Brighton]], UK, by Julia and Simon Indelicate,{{refn|Sometimes credited as Julia Clark-Lowes and Simon Clayton.|group="nb"}} who had met five years previously at a [[poetry slam]].<ref name=godint>{{cite web|archive-url=https://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091014075143/http://www.godisinthetvzine.co.uk/content/content_detail.php?id=983&type=Interviews|url=http://www.godisinthetvzine.co.uk/content/content_detail.php?id=983&type=Interviews|title=The Indelicates - Interview.|author=Bill Cummings|date=24 August 2006|archive-date=14 October 2009|website=[[God Is in the TV]]|access-date=20 October 2020}}</ref> The pair created several independent and joint artistic projects, which they promoted through their individual [[MySpace]] pages. Julia was also a [[documentary photographer]] and Simon had been a [[Performance poetry|performance poet]] on the [[cabaret]] circuit.

The band's last release while signed to Sad Gnome was the [[extended play|EP]] "The Last Significant Statement To Be Made in Rock'n'Roll", on 12 February 2007.<ref name=sad/> The six-track CD consisted of the title track, plus "Sixteen", "Heroin", acoustic track "Unity Mitford", live track "Stars" and a remix of the title track.

===Touring and singles===
Through 2007, the Indelicates had continued to play venues in the UK and Europe. In Germany they headlined several times and played support for [[Art Brut]],<ref name=okt2/> whose lead singer, [[Eddie Argos]], had previously called the Indelicates his favourite band.<ref name=jet1/> In April 2007, for British Music Week the German edition of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' profiled "the most important" British bands that were playing German cities that year, calling the Indelicates' "We Hate The Kids" and "Waiting For Pete Doherty to Die" "so very brilliant".<ref>{{cite news|title=Brits Pro Minute|author=Staff|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] (German edition)|date=April 2017|pages=124–125}}</ref>

By mid-year, the Indelicates had left Sad Gnome to join another independent label, [[Weekender Records]],<ref name=art>{{cite news|title=Julia, We Don't Live in the 60s - Review|work=[[Artrocker]]|date=July 2007|author=Valentine Mackie}}</ref> and in July released "Julia, We Don't Live in the 60s" as a CD single and 7" vinyl. The latter featured "Point Me to the West" as a B-side, while the CD release added to that song a live version of "Unity Mitford".<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=Julia, We Don't Live in the 60s|title-link=The Indelicates |year=2007 |last=The Indelicates |type=Liner Notes |publisher=Weekender Records}}</ref> ''[[Artrocker]]'' magazine called "Julia&nbsp;..." "intelligent, poetic indie-rock".<ref name=art/> ''[[The Guardian]]'' called the song "reasonably agreeable", while noting that for a rock song that was "not really a compliment".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jul/14/3|title=New Releases|author=Pete Cashmore|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=14 July 2007|access-date=22 October 2020}}</ref> ''[[Gigwise]]'', reviewing a live rendition of the song, cited its "soaring riffs" and "wry, nostalgic and deliciously doom-laden" lyrics.<ref name=gig/> Eddie Argos appeared in the music video.<ref name=art/>

The band's final single of 2007 was "Sixteen", released on 8 October on CD, 7" vinyl and digitally.

Several industry publications, including ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', had predicted mainstream success for the Indelicates for several years,<ref name=roll/><ref name=gig/> and though the band had achieved popularity in the [[blogosphere]], by the start of 2008 a breakout hit had eluded them.<ref name=godad>{{cite web|archive-url=https://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091014080847/http://www.godisinthetvzine.co.uk/content/content_detail.php?id%3D2382%26type%3DAlbums|url=http://www.godisinthetvzine.co.uk/content/content_detail.php?id%3D2382%26type%3DAlbums|title=The Indelicates - Interview.|date=13 April 2008|archive-date=14 October 2009|website=[[God Is in the TV]]|author=George Bass|access-date=24 October 2020}}</ref><ref name=gig>{{cite web|url=https://www.gigwise.com/reviews/39937/|title=Thursday 10/01/08 The Indelicates @ The Windmill, Brixton, London|author=Richard Mellor|website=[[Gigwise]]|date=14 January 2008|access-date=22 October 2020}}</ref>

On 24 March 2008, the band released its fourth single, "America" on CD, 7" vinyl and digitally. The vinyl release B-side "No Religion" was joined by "The Last Bombed City" on the CD release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/america-mw0001648097|title=America - The Indelicates|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=24 October 2020}}</ref>{{refn|Of "The Last Bombed City" Julia said: "[The song] is much more about how it feels to live in a century that really, REALLY got fucked by the World Wars, in that they both allowed for a great number of cultural and political changes, but destroyed any stable notion of the godlike. It’s about taking responsibility, about fathers, and most importantly about fascism."|group="nb"}} ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]'' magazine called the song an "entertaining polemic, whose lack of subtlety extends to the suitably big, brash rock musical soundtrack."<ref>{{cite news|title=The Indelicates - America|author=Staff|url=https://www.clashmusic.com/reviews/the-indelicates-america|date=28 March 2008|access-date=24 October 2020}}</ref> ''Room Thirteen'' said the song was "truly refreshing&nbsp;... a great track which is up-beat and powerful" and said that both Simon and Julia's vocals were "excellent and certainly complement the political nature of their music." The reviewer also praised both B-sides, saying the release added up to a "knockout combination".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roomthirteen.com/cgi-bin/cd_view.cgi?CDID=7774|title=Indelicates - America|author=Matt Brown|date=18 March 2008|website=Room Thirteen|access-date=25 October 2020}}</ref>

===''American Demo''===
[[File:The Indelicates.jpg|175px|thumb|right|Simon and Julia on the cover of ''American Demo'']]
"America" preceded the Indelicates' first album release, ''American Demo'' on 14 April 2008. Produced by Brian O'Shaughnessy at Bark Studio, and issued by Weekender on CD and as a 12" vinyl [[LP record|LP]], the album featured 14 tracks and included new and previously-released material. The album was released simulataneously in Germany through Weekender's sister label.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=American Demo|title-link=American Demo|year=2008|last=The Indelicates |type=Liner Notes |publisher=Weekender Records}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/release/american-demo-mr0002609838|access-date=25 October 2020|title=American Demo – The Indelicates|publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

George Bass, writing for ''God is in The TV'', called ''American Demo'' "rewardingly consistent" and said that it "breaks none of the promises [The Indelicates] have spent the last three years making". Bass remarked that while the album might look like "most machined poprock" it was "deeper than your average post-rock [[gatefold]]." He singled out critical favourite "New Art for the People" in particular as the band's signature track, "a raw monolith that's lost none of its veracity in the jump from the stage to the studio."<ref name=godad/> Jo Vallance of ''Room Thirteen'' called the album a "fantastic debut" that "blows away all the indie bands claiming to make a difference and say something that counts" and further praised the album for its "variety of sound".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roomthirteen.com/cgi-bin/cd_view.cgi?CDID=7588|title=Indelicates – American Demo|author=Jo Vallance|date=16 February 2008|access-date=25 October 2020|website=Room Thirteen}}</ref>

Neil Jones of ''[[MusicOMH]]'' called the album "a broad set of tracks that which spit immaculate bile here, vintage melodies there, and its very first track is a musical statement if ever I’ve heard one, Julia&nbsp;... etching out a violin contrapuntal to make the hairs stand on end." Jones complimented the way the album married the album's "sweet" melodies with the more barbed lyrical content, and concluded, "Corrosive performance poetry and pop music passion, this is an album on immaculate themes. American Demo really is the aesthetic arm of the outsiders, and The Indelicates right now are pretty much unbeatable."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Indelicates – American Demo|author=Neil Jones|date=14 April 2008|access-date=25 October 2020|website=MusicOMH|url=https://www.musicomh.com/reviews/albums/the-indelicates-american-demo}}</ref>

The Indelicates also made available a "Super Special Edition"—a £300 package including the "CD, signed vinyl, exclusive download, art/poster book, lyric book, signed print, jewellery, fudge and rope." The special edition also included a live performance of the album at "any UK venue" which would be recorded and the copyright for that recording given to the buyer, who could then sell the recording on the Corporate Records website if they wished.<ref>{{cite web|title=Indelicates play 'special edition' shows|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/music/a289608/indelicates-play-special-edition-shows/|author=Mayer Nissim|date=24 November 2010|access-date=28 October 2020|website=Digital Spy}}</ref>

Simon said that musically the album better represented what the band heard in their heads, and that ''American Demo'' had been compromised through being produced under the constraints of a label. Julia said that ''Songs for Swinging Lovers'' was a more personal album, citing "Savages" in particular.<ref name=digicorp/> Writing for ''PopMatters'', Maria Schurr said of the album's style that while it represented a continuation of ''American Demo''{{'}}s "lyrical attacks on society coated over with giddy indie pop hooks" ''Songs for Swinging Lovers'' "has been infused with a swish of cabaret." She later said that it sounded like "[a] collaboration between [[The Mekons]], [[The Wedding Present]], Carter USM, and [[Luke Haines]], with a song co-written by [[Jacques Brel]] following a really awesome séance".<ref name=popkor/> Schurr said that the album was "dazzlingly close to perfection" and though its first half was its strongest, the second was "more convincing of the Indelicates' greatness than ten years' worth of 'Next Big Thing' issues of ''NME''".<ref name=popsongs>{{cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/125233-the-indelicates-songs-for-swinging-lovers-2496198010.html|title=The Indelicates: Songs For Swinging Lovers|date=4 August 2010|access-date=27 October 2020}}</ref>

In ''Digital Spy'' Mayer Nissim wrote that ''Songs for Swinging Lovers'' lacked "a bit of the coherence and gloss 'n' polish" of ''American Demo'', but that it was "an assured, aggressive follow-up". He said that, as with their debut, "The Indelicates' trick is to suck you in with hooks that have you either dancing or swooning before the lyrics smash you in the chops." Nissim singled out "Roses" as the album's standout and "Sympathy for the Devil" as an "odd misstep", concluding that while the Indelicates were doing nothing new musically, ''Songs for Swinging Lovers'' showed "that it really is what you do with it that counts".<ref name=digisong/>

The album was also praised by Neil Gaiman, and in Germany's ''[[:de:Intro (Zeitschrift)|Intro]]'' magazine, [[Jack Black]] singled out Julia's voice especially for praise, saying, "I love her."<ref>{{cite news|title=Platten Vor Gericht|author=Jack Black|work=[[:de:Intro (Zeitschrift)|Intro]]|date=January 2011|page=74}}</ref> In 2018, The Quietus ranked ''Songs for Swinging Lovers'' at #72 on its writers' poll list of "The Top 100 Albums of the Quietus' Existence" (2008–2018), calling it a "pop masterpiece".<ref name=quietus/>

In the absence of traditional [[Record chart#Chart hit|chart tracking]] for the album, the band said the measure of success for ''Songs for Swinging Lovers'' would be "if we're financially solvent&nbsp;... success is basically not having to stop".<ref name=digicorp/> Just over a year later, the band reported that it had sold well enough to fund the recording and release of their next album.{{refn|According to the Indelicates ''Songs for Swinging Lovers'' had by May 2011 sold "5,000 downloads&nbsp;... a whole bunch of CDs and LPs and quite a few £300 Super Special Limited Editions".|group="nb"}}<ref name=godkor>{{cite web|url=http://www.godisinthetvzine.co.uk/2011/05/18/video-the-indelicates-i-am-koresh-corporate-records/|title=Video: The Indelicates – I am Koresh (Corporate Records)|author=ManScared|date=18 May 2014|access-date=30 October 2020|website=God Is in the TV}}</ref>

Indie bands – This was done in your name and you could have crippled their argument by standing against it but chose not to."<ref name=digidea2/> The band would later address an all-party group of MPs at Parliament to present on the subject of [[digital rights]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.godisinthetvzine.co.uk/2011/04/12/119/|title=The Indelicates reveal third album|author=Bill Cummings|date=12 April 2011|access-date=27 October 2020|website=[[God Is in the TV]]}}</ref>

===''David Koresh Superstar''===
''David Koresh Superstar'' is a [[concept album]] about [[David Koresh]] and the [[Waco siege]] in 1993, during which 82 members of the religious sect [[Branch Davidians|Branch Davidian]] (including their leader, Koresh) and four personnel within the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms]] (ATF) law enforcement were killed. The album was released in the UK on 16 May 2011 and in the US on 24 May, through Corporate Records.<ref name=popkor/> It was re-released in the US with additional material in October 2011 to coincide with the Indelicates' first US tour. According to the band, the album's style is a mix of "rebel" [[country music]], luau, disco and [[rock opera]]. It was recorded at Ramble Creek Studio in [[Austin, Texas]] with producer [[Milton Mapes|Britton Beisenherz]], and at Bark Studio in London with producer Brian O’Shaugnessy.<ref name=godkor/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/music/a295865/indelicates-announce-imminent-new-album/|title=Indelicates announce 'imminent' new album|author=Mayer Nissim|date=4 January 2011|access-date=30 October 2020|website=Digital Spy}}</ref>

[[File:David koresh.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''David Koresh Superstar'' is a concept album about the life of Vernon Howell (later [[David Koresh]]).<ref name=godkor/>]]
''Koresh'' also features guest vocals from [[Jim Bob]] of [[Carter USM]], [[Mikey Georgeson]]{{refn|Also known by his stage name, The Vessel.|group="nb"}} of [[David Devant and his Spirit Wife]], [[Philip Jeays]] and Lily Rae, plus members of [[Luxembourg (band)|Luxembourg]], [[The Boyfriends (UK band)|The Boyfriends]] and [[Keith Top of the Pops & His Minor UK Indie Celebrity All-Star Backing Band]]. The bulk of recording had taken place by Summer 2010, with additional recording, mixing and mastering carried out towards the end of 2010.

At ''PopMatters'', Maria Schurr called ''David Koresh Superstar'' the Indelicates' "most ambitious undertaking to date" and that they had "done a stunning job at making history intriguing". In particular Schurr praised Julia and Simon's "strong, dramatic singing voices [as] suited to the material" while noting that Simon's American accent as Koresh was "convincing enough" but overindulgent during the album's second song, "The Road From Houston to Waco". She also praised the performances of Philip Jeays (as an ATF member) and Jim Bob (playing [[Timothy McVeigh]]). Schurr said that the album's high point was "Something's Goin' Down in Waco", which "gives a vivid illustration of the rapidly escalating events" and concluded that while ''Koresh'' "peaks and dives" and may "drag a bit", it was worth persevering with for the closing track, a "blistering rendition" of the folk song "[[John the Revelator (song)|John the Revelator]]".<ref name=popkor>{{cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/141328-the-indelicates-david-koresh-superstar-2496027082.html|title=The Indelicates: David Koresh Superstar|date=21 May 2011|access-date=31 October 2020|website=PopMatters}}</ref>

In Christian news magazine ''[[World (magazine)|World]]'', Arsenio Orteza wrote that the album "[gets] to the core of cult and conspiracy-theory mentality" and that the songs "A Single Thrown Grenade" and "I Don't Care If It's True" "articulate megalomania and its discontents at their most sadly poignant." Comparing the album to the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[The Book of Mormon (musical)|The Book of Mormon]]'' Orteza said that where that musical mocked its subject, the Indelicates' intention was to understand, and that "The extent to which they succeed is chilling."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://world.wng.org/2011/06/getting_religion|title=Getting religion|author=Arsenio Orteza|date=3 June 2011|access-date=31 October 2020|work=[[World (magazine)|World]]}}</ref>

''David Koresh Superstar'' was written before ''Songs for Swinging Lovers'', as the band had initially wanted to release a concept album to avoid [[sophomore slump|difficult second album syndrome]].<ref name=digicorp/> Simon later said he regretted describing ''Koresh'' as a concept album, as it gave the impression it existed outside the "main continuity" of the band, and the perception that it was a "side project" may have harmed its popularity with the band's fans.<ref name=source>{{cite news|url=https://brightonsource.co.uk/features/the-indelicates-interview/|title=The Indelicates Interview|date=16 October 2015|access-date=28 October 2020|author=Adam Peters|work=The Brighton Source}}</ref>

''God Is in the TV'' praised the first two tracks ("Bitterness is the Appropriate Response" and "Pubes") as having "more muscle" and as a departure from the band's usual style, but lamented that the rest of the album did not follow suit. The reviewer concluded that it remained "a fine album, with some great instrumentation and clever lyrics".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.godisinthetvzine.co.uk/2013/07/04/track-of-the-day-the-indelicates-bitterness-is-the-appropriate-response/|title=Track of The Day #305: The Indelicates – Bitterness Is the Appropriate Response|author=Staff|date=4 July 2013|access-date=31 October 2020|website=God Is in the TV}}</ref> Author and journalist [[Kieron Gillen]] singled out "Not Alone" as one of his songs of the year, "their [[Everybody Hurts]], but with all the necessary cruelty to make us cynics swallow it."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kierongillen.tumblr.com/post/73105294572/tracks-of-the-year-2013|title=Tracks Of The Year 2013|date=12 January 2014|access-date=1 November 2020|website=kierongillen.tumblr.com|author=Kieron Gillen}}</ref>

Maria Schurr of ''PopMatters'' said that ''Diseases of England'' "is as grand as anything in the duo’s back catalog" while being somewhat "slower and less reliant on humour" than the band's previous albums. She also noted the different tone of the first two tracks, from which the album moves to a more deliberate pace replacing their "youthful defiance" with "potent revulsion". Schurr said that while approximately "90% of the songs on here evoke filthy streets mottled with contaminated rainwater&nbsp;... the Indelicates are the band that can make such unsavory visions inviting". She concluded that the album was "a grimily beautiful release worthy of the heart that was put in to it".<ref name=popdiss>{{cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/171899-the-indelicates-diseases-of-england-2495753641.html|title=The Indelicates: Diseases of England|author=Maria Schurr|date=27 June 2013|access-date=31 October 2020|website=PopMatters}}</ref>

The Indelicates also released music videos for "Not Alone", "Everything Is Just Disgusting"—which features puppets of the band—and the [[machinima]] "Dovahkiin", which was created using the video game ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]''. In October 2013, the band also released ''Part IV'' of "Diseases of England" as [[Downloadable content|DLC]], consisting of four new songs recorded at Dean Street Stuidos with Keith TOTP, and ten demo versions of other songs from the album, recorded at Simon and Julia's home.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/music/a506043/the-indelicates-unveil-puppet-music-video-podcast-tease-new-material/|title=The Indelicates unveil puppet music video, podcast, tease new material|author=Mayer Nissim|date=12 August 2013|access-date=1 November 2020|website=Digital Spy}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/music/a519897/the-indelicates-release-diseases-of-england-part-4-dlc/|title=The Indelicates release 'Diseases of England' Part 4 DLC|author=Mayer Nissim|date=1 October 2013|access-date=1 November 2020|website=Digital Spy}}</ref>

By 2013, the Indelicates remained somewhat popular and acclaimed in Germany, but had still found success in the UK elusive.<ref name=source2/> After analysing the band's website traffic, Simon claimed that larger numbers of visitors had come from "obvious places" such as London and New York, but the remainder were single-person hits from "pretty much every city I've ever heard of". He concluded, "So we’re an unsuccessful band, but on a global scale!"<ref name=source/> Simon and Julia had also gathered an almost entirely new backing line-up for live shows, including Benny Lewis (drums) and Nick Kos (bass), who would remain with the band thereafter.<ref name=source2>{{cite news|url=https://brightonsource.co.uk/reviews/the-indelicates-review/|title=The Indelicates Review|date=1 May 2013|access-date=1 November 2020|author=Adam Peters|work=The Brighton Source}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indelicates.com/bio-2/|title=Bio – The Indelicates|access-date=1 November 2020|website=indelicates.com}}</ref>

In 2014, the Indelicates worked on creating a musical,{{refn|What would later become ''Paradise Rocks''|group="nb"}} but found the logistical challenges at odds with the band's availability, especially after Julia became pregnant with the couple's first child. Instead, they decided to work on recording and releasing a new album, ''Elevator Music''.

Simon described the intention of intentional listening environments was to "[recapture] some of the magic of the HMV listening booth or the bedroom record player and bringing music back out from the background – while adding emotional weight with short narrative experiences that mesh with and enhance the songs."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://virtualrealitytimes.com/2014/11/30/the-indelicates-use-oculus-rift-to-release-new-single/|title=The Indelicates Use Oculus Rift To Release New Single|author=Anushay Qaiser|date=30 November 2014|access-date=1 November 2020|website=Virtual Reality Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vrfocus.com/2014/11/rock-group-indelicates-release-vr-pop-single-oculus-rift/|title=Rock Group The Indelicates Release VR Pop Single With Oculus Rift|author=Jamie Feltham|date=30 November 2014|access-date=1 November 2020|website=VRFocus}}</ref>

Maria Schurr of ''PopMatters'', while praising the innovative marketing, said that the song "deserves repeat plays in its own right, with the sort of vital generational commentary that so many current bands fail to provide". Schurr also said that the song's "lush and orchestral" style represented a musical evolution for the band.<ref name=popgen/>

''Elevator Music'' was officially released on 13 October 2015, though fans who pre-ordered the album could receive a digital copy early, and the download-only version could be bought from August 2015.<ref name=digel>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/music/a663612/the-indelicates-launch-new-album-elevator-music-with-a-360-degree-spherical-music-video/|title=The Indelicates launch new album Elevator Music with a 360-degree spherical music video|author=Mayer Nissim|date=15 August 2020|access-date=1 November 2020|website=Digital Spy}}</ref> The CD and double vinyl editions were released on 20 November.<ref name=source/> The album was mainly recorded at Simon and Julia's home studio and produced by Simon, with additional material ("choirs and live drums") recorded at Dean Street Studios with Keith TOTP.<ref name=source/><ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=Elevator Music|title-link=The Indelicates |others=The Indelicates |year=2015|first=The |last=Indelicates |type=Liner Notes |publisher=Corporate Records}}</ref> As with the band's previous Corporate Records album releases, also available were several special edition packages, including the usual in-person live recording where the copyright for the recording would be handed over to the buyer, and a "Mark of the Beast" edition for £666, for which the band said they would "re-record all the vocals for you with metal-style screams and send you the results". To coincide with the album's release, the band made a video for "Beyond the Radio Horizon" as a [[360-degree video|360-degree]] (or "spherical") video, which would allow users to look around as the video played.<ref name=digel/>

The album's style was described as a departure from the band's previous music, "[covering] an even greater range of styles than you’d usually expect" from them, including "[[a cappella]] folksong and glam thrash" amid "power pop, cabaret punk and prog rock".<ref name=source/> Simon reluctantly called ''Elevator Music'' a concept album (owing to an aversion for the term after using it to describe ''David Koresh Superstar''), saying it was about "what happens when the Internet achieves consciousness".<ref name=source/>

===Juniverbrecher===
The Indelicates released their sixth album, ''Juniverbrecher'', digitally on 23 July 2017, the anniversary of the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|Brexit referendum]]. It was described by the band as about banishing the "[[Jimmy Savile]]/[[Mr. Punch]]/[[Brexit]]" demon. Recording the album, Simon and Julia were joined by band members Alastair Clayton, Nick Kos and Benny Lewis, plus violinist Louisa Wood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indelicates.com/bio-2/|title=The Indelicates|website=indelicates.com|access-date=1 November 2020}}</ref> To promote the album, the band played venues in London and Brighton and toured Germany, where they were supported by London indie rock band [[Fightmilk]].<ref>{{in lang|de}} {{cite web|url=https://www.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/inhalt.konzertevent-in-stuttgart-feuerbach-so-kommt-man-ins-bunkerkonzert.b9ccbb2c-fae6-411f-a2ec-4beb38b953ec.html|title=So kommt man ins Bunkerkonzert|author=Jan Georg Plavec|work=[[Stuttgarter Nachrichten]]|date=22 April 2018|access-date=1 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indelicates.com/tour2018/|title=Die Juniverbrecher Tour, 2018|website=indelicates.com|access-date=1 November 2020}}</ref> Heather Newton took over on violin for the tour.<ref>{{in lang|de}} {{cite web|url=https://www.gig-blog.net/2018/04/09/the-indelicates-fightmilk-07-04-2018-tiefbunker-feuerbach-stuttgart/|title=The Indelicates, FightMilk, 07.04.2018, Tiefbunker Feuerbach, Stuttgart|date=9 April 2018|access-date=1 November 2020|author=Christian Seyffert|website=gig-blog.net}}</ref> Writer Kieron Gillen named the track "Everything English Is the Enemy" from the album as his #9 song of 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kierongillen.substack.com/p/051-we-live-in-the-shadow-of-a-book|author=[[Kieron Gillen]]|title=Newsletter 051: We Live in the Shadow of a Book Avalanche|date=11 January 2018|access-date=1 November 2020|website=kierongillen.substack.com}}</ref>

==Other Work==
''Book of Job: The Musical'' was written by Simon and has been performed by Simon, Julia and others since 2005. Described by Simon as "an [[Andrew Lloyd-Webber]] type Biblical musical done in a very threadbare way, with the narrator describing what would be happening if the show had a Lloyd-Webber style budget for sets, cast and effects" the musical is usually performed with a cast of six people and with one [[acoustic guitar]]. The band revive the musical "every couple of years" and have performed it at venues around the UK, including Brighton, London, the [[Edinburgh Festival]], [[Cheltenham Literary Festival]],<ref name=3am/> and the [[Ledbury Poetry Festival]]. Gary Bills-Geddes, writing for the ''[[Worcester News]]'', called the musical "one of the most memorable and enjoyable things" he had seen.<ref name=led>{{cite news|title=Ledbury Poetry Festival announces highlights of 2019|url=https://www.worcesternews.co.uk/news/17308742.ledbury-poetry-festival-announces-highlights-2019/|author=Gary Bills-Geddes|date=18 December 2018|access-date=30 October 2020|work=[[Worcester News]]}}</ref>

The Indelicates released a two-part recording of the musical through the Corporate Records website—the first part on 28 February 2011 and the second on 7 March. Recorded at [[Dean Street Studios]] by Keith TOTP, the release featured Simon, Julia and Alastair from the band, plus [[Mary Hampton]], Chris Hodges, Sarah Pinkney, Laurie Penny and Michael Parker. Mikey Georgeson of David Devant and his Spirit Wife cameos.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mayer Nissim|title=Indelicates confirm two-part 'Job' release|date=24 February 2011|access-date=30 October 2020|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/music/a295865/indelicates-announce-imminent-new-album/|website=Digital Spy}}</ref> In 2015, Simon and Julia also created a children's show, ''Goblins Live'', for which they made the puppets and set decoration, and which they performed at local venues.<ref name=source/>

''Paradise Rocks'' is a musical set in the 1960s "in the style of an Elvis movie" and is based on the 17th century epic poem ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' by [[John Milton]]. Written by Simon in 2014, the musical was not performed until 2018 owing to the logistical challenges involved. Unlike ''Book of Job: The Musical'', ''Paradise Rocks'' required a larger number of actors, musicians and technicians.<ref name=source/> The Indelicates, with The Devil's Party Theatre Company, performed the musical at venues in the UK through 2019, including the Ledbury Poetry Festival, the [[Brighton Fringe]] festival and in London.<ref name=led/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://paradiserocks.co.uk/|title=Paradise Rocks!|website=paradiserocks.co.uk|access-date=1 November 2020}}</ref> For ''Fringe Review'', Robin Manuell said that the musical was "the most all round entertaining show I have had the pleasure to see" and that the songs were "excellent". He also praised director Lex Lake and choreographer Roger Duncan for "the quality of the ensemble work". Manuell said that while the cast all had moments of excellence and the singing was of a high standard, during the performance he saw "not all the performers can keep this up all the time" and some were "patchy". He nevertheless concluded that ''Paradise Rocks'' was "an outstanding play and an outstanding production".<ref name=fringe>{{cite web|url=http://fringereview.co.uk/review/brighton-fringe/2019/paradise-rocks/|date=22 May 2019|author=Robin Manuell|title=Brighton Fringe 2019 – Paradise Rocks|access-date=1 November 2020|website=Fringe Review}}</ref>
