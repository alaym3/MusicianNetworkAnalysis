==History==
===2015–17: Formation and ''Zest Pop''===
The band formed after lead singer Marco Rivero was kicked out of a previous band he was in with bassist Augusto Di Catarina and ex-drummer Armando Baeza. A month later, Rivero wrote the song "Taking Up Space" and shared it with Baeza; the two of them then gathered the rest of the band's members and started recording their first album.<ref name=mustardnite/> The name Mustard Service was taken from a band name generator. According to Rivero, "I did it like three times, it was between Mustard Service, Milk and Equality, and like… Johnny’s Trashcan."<ref name=wvum/>

Their debut album, ''Zest Pop'', was released on June 17, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://genius.com/albums/Mustard-service/Zest-pop|title=Mustard Service - Zest Pop|access-date=21 November 2021|website=Genius}}</ref>

===2018–20: "Need", "Daddy Dookie Brown", and ''C'est La Vie''===
In fall 2018, Mustard Service accompanied the Madrid band [[Hinds (band)|Hinds]] on a sixteen-date U.S. tour, where they received praise for their energetic stage performances.<ref name=mustardnite/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.miaminewtimes.com/music/new-miami-music-releases-oscar-g-virgo-mustard-service-jaialai-las-nubes-palomino-blond-11610670|last=Gibbs|first=Jessica|title=Five New Miami Music Releases to Get You Through Quarantine|date=1 April 2020|website=Miami New Times|accessdate=22 November 2021}}</ref><ref name=tampa>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cltampa.com/music/show-previews/article/21044056/tampa-bay-live-music-saturday-with-midnight-star-ray-barbee-and-more|title=Tampa Bay live music Saturday with Midnight Star, Ray Barbee and more|last=Roa|first=Ray|website=Creative Loafing: Tampa Bay|date=19 January 2019|accessdate=22 November 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://panthernow.com/2018/10/15/hinds-delivers-charismatic-performance/|title=Hinds delivers “charismatic” performance|last=Mosquera|first=Megan|website=PantherNOW|date=15 October 2018|accessdate=22 November 2021}}</ref>

Mustard Service released the single "Daddy Dookie Brown" and an accompanying music video on July 26, 2019.<ref>{{Cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuyLDtepJRA&ab_channel=MustardService|title=Mustard Service - Daddy Dookie Brown (Official Video)|date=26 July 2019|access-date=22 November 2021|last=Mustard Service|via=Youtube}}</ref> A second single, "Need", was released in November 2019.<ref name=wvum/>

Their sophomore album, ''C'est La Vie'', was released on March 23, 2020,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://open.spotify.com/album/6luAUwvP1B6JgCci2Tyoqc|title=Spotify – C'est La Vie|website=Spotify|access-date=22 November 2021}}</ref> and marked a change in style from their previous album both musically and thematically. Rivero remarked that since ''Zest Pop'', the band had "learned a lot more musically. So this one is a little bit more sophisticated."<ref name=mustardnite/> Rivero also noted that the lyrical themes of ''C'est La Vie'' were more light-hearted and less personal: "when we wrote ''Zest Pop'', I didn’t think that anyone would hear it, so I wrote whatever I wanted, kind of like a journal... and then I realized people started listening, so I said, I don’t want to write anything personal anymore. I wanted to write about a kid who liked to get peed on [in reference to "Daddy Dookie Brown"], so..."<ref name=wvum/> The writing process of ''C'est La Vie'' also differed from ''Zest Pop'' in that ''C'est La Vie'' was written by the whole band using a more collaborative approach, while ''Zest Pop'' had been written mostly by Rivero and Baeza.<ref name=marco>{{Cite interview|last=Rivero|first=Marco|interviewer=William Bazzone|title=An Interview: Marco Rivero Ochoa of Mustard Service|url=https://wtbazzone.wixsite.com/bazzreviews/post/an-interview-marco-rivero-ochoa-of-mustard-service|date=3 May 2020|access-date=23 November 2021}}</ref>

===2021–present: ''Fiddle Lake''===
On October 27, 2021, Mustard Service released their first EP, ''Fiddle Lake''. With songs reflecting on politics, addiction, and work culture, ''Fiddle Lake'' takes on more mature themes than Mustard Service's previous albums.<ref name=fiddle>{{Cite web|url=https://wsum.org/2021/11/17/mustard-service-fiddle-lake/|last=Phelan|first=Molly|title=Mustard Service – “Fiddle Lake”|website=WSUM|date=17 November 2021|access-date=23 November 2021}}</ref>
