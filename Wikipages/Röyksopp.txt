''Junior'' was followed by ''[[Senior (Röyksopp album)|Senior]]'', which is more quiet, "withdrawn and introspective" and "create[s] an atmosphere and an ambiance".<ref name="line">{{cite web| url = http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/2009/02/tlobf-interview-royksopp/| title = TLOBF Interview: Röyksopp| first = Andy| last = Johnson| date = 23 February 2009| publisher = The Line of Best Fit| access-date = 14 August 2010| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100706205150/http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/2009/02/tlobf-interview-royksopp/| archive-date = 6 July 2010| df = dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="prefix">{{cite web| url = http://www.prefixmag.com/reviews/royksopp/junior/24516/| title = Royksopp: Junior| first = Andria| last = Spring| date = 4 February 2009| publisher = Prefix| access-date = 14 August 2010| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100412194842/http://www.prefixmag.com/reviews/royksopp/junior/24516| archive-date = 12 April 2010| df = dmy-all}}</ref> Senior is the duo's first album to consist solely of instrumental tracks.<ref name="pitchforksenior">{{cite web | url = http://pitchfork.com/news/39250-royksopp-to-release-instrumental-lp/ | title = Röyksopp to Release Instrumental LP| last = Dombal| first = Ryan | date= 23 June 2009 | publisher = [[Pitchfork Media]] | access-date= 14 August 2010}}</ref> The first single from the album, "The Drug", was released on 9 August 2010.<ref name="discog"/> The album itself was released on 13 September 2010,<ref name="senior">{{cite web| url = http://royksopp.com/senior | title = Senior | author= Röyksopp| date = 23 June 2010 | publisher = Röyksopp.com| access-date= 14 August 2010}}</ref> and was successful in the band's native Norway, peaking at number one, the band's fourth consecutive release to do so.<ref name=NOR/>

===2013–2016: ''Do It Again'', ''The Inevitable End'' and ''Star Wars Headspace''===
In January 2013, Röyksopp released a song called "Running to the Sea", a collaboration with Norwegian artist [[Susanne Sundfør]]. According to the band, the song was written and recorded in two days for a televised performance.<ref>[http://royksopp.com/ Röyksopp | Official website]. Royksopp.com (16 June 2013). Retrieved on 3 July 2013.</ref> The single was released on 16 December 2013,{{Update after|2013|12|16}} with a B-side containing a song called "Something in My Heart", featuring Jamie McDermott from [[The Irrepressibles]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Listen: Röyksopp's new song "Something in My Heart"|date=15 November 2013|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2013/11/listen-royksopps-new-song-something-in-my-heart/|access-date=15 November 2013}}</ref> Röyksopp and Sundfør also collaborated in creating a cover version of [[Depeche Mode]]'s "[[Dreaming of Me|Ice Machine]]" for their [[Late Night Tales]] compilation album, ''[[Late Night Tales: Röyksopp]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Listen: Röyksopp – Ice Machine (Ft.

On 14 April 2014, Röyksopp announced a collaborative [[Extended play|EP]] with [[Robyn]] titled ''[[Do It Again (Röyksopp and Robyn album)|Do It Again]]'' to coincide with their [[Do It Again (Röyksopp and Robyn album)#Tour|joint tour]]. A snippet of one of the five tracks set to be released on the album, "Monument", was released the same day. The album was released on 26 May through Dog Triumph, [[Wall of Sound (record label)|Wall of Sound]], and [[Cooking Vinyl]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Robyn and Röyksopp announce collaborative album Do It Again|date=14 April 2014|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2014/04/robyn-and-royksopp-announce-collaborative-album-do-it-again/|publisher=[[Consequence of Sound]]|access-date=14 April 2014}}</ref> The duo stated that a re-worked version of "Monument" would form a part of their next album. On 29 September 2014, Röyksopp announced that their next album, titled ''[[The Inevitable End]]'', would explore "darker subject matter with emphasis on the lyrical content", and would be their last LP, though they will not stop making music.<ref>{{cite web|title=Goodbye to the Traditional Album Format…|date=29 September 2014|url=http://royksopp.com/2014/09/goodbye-traditional-album-format/|access-date=29 September 2014}}</ref> The album was released on 7 November 2014 by Dog Triumph. The special edition of the album includes new versions of the previously released tracks "Running to the Sea", "Do It Again" and "Monument" as well as the original version of "Something in My Heart". Some singles did precede the release of the album: "Skulls", "Sordid Affair" and the new version of "Monument". "Skulls" and "Monument" were accompanied by two new video clips. The video for "I Had This Thing" was shared on 11 May 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Röyksopp reveal video for new single 'I Had This Thing'|url=http://www.neverenoughnotes.co.uk/2015/05/royksopp-reveal-video-for-new-single-i-had-this-thing/|website=Never Enough Notes|publisher=Never Enough Notes|access-date=11 May 2015}}</ref>

In early 2015, it was announced that the band had composed a musical accompaniment to a comedic work based upon the novels of [[Franz Kafka]]. The project debuted at the Bergen International Festival in the same year.<ref name="fib.no"/> Also in 2015, the Norwegian public broadcaster [[NRK]] introduced a series of new jingles by Röyksopp for the TV output of the ''NRK Nyheter'' news division, as part of a comprehensive redesign of the sub-brand. On 8 February 2016, Röyksopp announced that a new track titled "Bounty Hunters" would be included on the ''[[Star Wars Headspace]]'' compilation.

=== 2019-2021: ''Lost Tapes'' ===
In February 2019, the band announced that they would be releasing B-sides, exclusives and previously unreleased tracks through the ''Lost Tapes'' playlist, starting with "I Wanna Know" and "Rising Urge".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://royksopp.com/2019/02/lost-tapes/|title=Lost Tapes|date=2019-02-27|website=Röyksopp|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> The tracks have been released for free on music streaming services, including Spotify and YouTube, but are also sold in digital stores like Amazon and the iTunes Store. In August 2019, Röyksopp released a collaborative single with [[Lars Vaular]], called "To minutter".<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-08-23|title=Effektiv spilletid|url=https://p3.no/musikk/effektiv-spilletid/|access-date=2019-08-23|website=NRK P3|language=no}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Lars Vaular teamer opp med Röyksopp på ny låt! {{!}} Sony Music Norway|url=https://www.ntbinfo.no/pressemelding/lars-vaular-teamer-opp-med-royksopp-pa-ny-lat?publisherId=8931514&releaseId=17869332|access-date=2019-08-23|website=www.ntbinfo.no|language=no}}</ref>

The band kept releasing new ''Lost Tapes'' until 25 January 2021, when they announced the project has come to a halt for the time being.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://royksopp.com/2021/01/lost-tapes-announcement/|title=A Lost Tapes Announcement|date=2021-01-25|website=Röyksopp|language=en-US|access-date=2021-01-25}}</ref> A total of 15 tracks have been released, the last track being a live version of "Alpha Male". 

In August 2021, the physical edition of ''Lost Tapes'' was announced. Due to be released on 17 September 2021, the release contains the first 10 tracks from the series and is available on vinyl, CD and casette.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-08-06|title=Röyksopp Lost Tapes announcement tweet|url=https://twitter.com/royksopp/status/1423629943787954186|url-status=live|access-date=2021-08-09|website=[[Twitter]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Lost Tapes|url=https://store.royksopp.com/collections/lost-tapes|access-date=2021-08-09|website=Röyksopp|language=en}}</ref>

==Style==

===Musical style===
Röyksopp's music is often referred to as "warm",<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="interview"/> a reference to the band's downbeat electronica that combines elements of house music and Afro-American sounds.<ref name="interview"/>

A notable component of Röyksopp's song repertoire relies on the use of multiple lead vocalists. For instance, ''Melody A.M.'' features the vocal talents of [[Anneli Drecker]] and [[Erlend Øye]],<ref name="meldoyamliner">{{cite AV media notes| title = Melody A.M. | title-link= Melody A.M. | year= 2001 | type= CD liner | publisher = Astralwerks}}</ref> ''The Understanding'' features [[Kate Havnevik]], [[Chelonis R. Jones]], and [[Karin Dreijer Andersson]],<ref name="underliner">{{cite AV media notes| title = The Understanding | title-link= The Understanding (Röyksopp album) | year= 2005 | type= CD liner | publisher = Astralwerks}}</ref> and ''Junior'' features [[Robyn]], Anneli Drecker, Karin Dreijer Andersson, and [[Lykke Li]].<ref name="juniorliner">{{cite AV media notes| title = Junior | title-link= Junior (Röyksopp album) | year= 2009 | type= CD liner | publisher = Astralwerks}}</ref>

Röyksopp enjoy using classic synthesizers, including the [[Monophony|monophonic]] [[Korg MS-20]], the [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] [[Roland Juno-106]], and multiple members of the [[Sampler (musical instrument)#Akai|Akai Sampler Series]].<ref name="barcode"/> The band has stated that they prefer using analogue synthesizers over digital ones.<ref name="interview"/><ref name="barcode"/> Svein Berge said, "It's fairly limited the fun you can have with the use of a mouse. We like to mix."<ref name="barcode"/>

In addition to writing their own music, the duo enjoy remixing songs.<ref name="barcode"/> Berge said, "It's obviously fun remixing people like [[Coldplay]], artists of such a big calibre. Whenever people approach us for a remix it's very nice; being approached by [[Roots Manuva]], [[The Streets]], and even [[Peter Gabriel]] is quite fun."<ref name="barcode"/> The band was also asked by [[Britney Spears]] for a remix, but had to turn down the offer due to scheduling conflicts.<ref name="musicone"/>

===Influences===
As they grew up in northern Norway, Svein Berge and Torbjørn Brundtland listened to [[Tromsø techno scene|local artists]] like [[Bel Canto (band)|Bel Canto]] and former Bel Canto member [[Biosphere (musician)|Biosphere]]<ref name="interview"/> (whom, coincidentally, Berge and Brundtland would remix in 1997 while they were part of Alanïa). The band has also expressed their interest in the music of [[Kraftwerk]], [[Brian Eno]], [[Giorgio Moroder]], [[Art of Noise]], [[Vangelis]], [[Erik Satie]], and [[Francis Lai]].<ref name="interview"/> Svein Berge has also stated that he is very fond of the production and programming skills of Datassette, who produced a remix of the Röyksopp single "Happy Up Here".<ref name="line"/>

Röyksopp often include references and homages to their musical influences. For instance, "Röyksopp Forever" pays homage to famous electronica musicians from the 1970s, including, "the likes of [[Vangelis]] and these people, and [[Krautrock]], like [[Tangerine Dream]] and even [[Pink Floyd]] and [[King Crimson]]."<ref name="line"/>

===Live performances===
Röyksopp is known for its elaborate concert performances. Marc Hogan of Pitchfork Media said that "Those who have heard Röyksopp's two albums&nbsp;... won't be surprised to learn the Norwegian duo's live set is much better and more raucuous than hunching next to the speakers at yer {{sic}} local [[Crate & Barrel]]".<ref name="pitchforklive">{{cite web | url = http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6863-royksopps-night-out/ | title = Pitchfork: Album Reviews: Röyksopp: Röyksopp's Night Out | last = Hogan| first = Marc | date= 26 April 2006 | publisher = [[Pitchfork Media]] | access-date= 14 August 2010}}</ref> When performing live, the duo often appear in eccentric outfits. Ari Stein, of [[Electronic Beats]], said, that during one particular live set, "Röyksopp returned with two separate encores, one which included Berge playing "Eple" with a space suit capsule on his head".<ref name="ebeats">{{cite web | url = http://www.electronicbeats.net/Events/Event-Reviews/Roeyksopp-live-at-Lido-Berlin | title = Röyksopp Live at Lido Berlin | last = Stein | first = Ari | date = 4 August 2009 | publisher = [[Electronic Beats]] | access-date = 14 August 2010 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090825211541/http://www.electronicbeats.net/Events/Event-Reviews/Roeyksopp-live-at-Lido-Berlin | archive-date = 25 August 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

However, some criticism has been aimed at the repetitive nature of the band and the trip hop genre in general. [[Robert Christgau]] said that, "chill-out tends toward waiting-room music for plastic surgeons who really want you to order that butt implant. Where once [Röyksopp] were extolled for their subtle melodicism, here their schlock candidly attacks the jugular. If they're [[Air (French band)|Air]], [[Goldie]] was [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]]."<ref name="robertchristgau">{{cite web | url = http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=R%F6yksopp | title = Robert Christgau: CG: Röyksopp| last = Christgau| first = Robert | access-date= 24 October 2010}}</ref> [[Pitchfork Media]], in their review of ''Senior'', said that "the kind of downtempo stuff that makes up the majority of Röyksopp's vocal-less compositions just doesn't hold up to concentrated, repeated listens like many other forms of instrumental electronic music."<ref name="pitchforksenior2">{{cite web | url = http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14624-senior/ | title = Pitchfork: Album Reviews: Röyksopp: Senior| last = Love| first = Joshua | date= 13 September 2010 | publisher = [[Pitchfork Media]] | access-date= 24 October 2010}}</ref>
