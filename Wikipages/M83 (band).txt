'''M83''' is a French [[electronic music]] project formed in [[Antibes]], [[Alpes-Maritimes]] in 1999 and currently based in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. The band's primary member is vocalist, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and record producer Anthony Gonzalez.{{efn|group=upper-alpha|While primarily a solo project by Anthony Gonzalez, the liner notes of ''[[Saturdays = Youth]]'' (2008) credit Loïc Maurin and [[Morgan Kibby]] as being part of M83.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Saturdays = Youth|year=2008|type=liner notes|publisher=[[EMI|EMI Music France]]|id=3099952058524}}</ref> Gonzalez has also stated: "For me, M83 is more of a collective than a solo project."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://exclaim.ca/music/article/m83-the_memoirist|title=M83 The Memoirist|work=[[Exclaim!]]|last=Lindsay|first=Cam|date=April 20, 2016|access-date=March 22, 2018}}</ref>}} The band was initially formed as a duo also with [[Team Ghost|Nicolas Fromageau]]; it has released eight albums and two soundtracks, including the [[Grammy Award]]-nominated ''[[Hurry Up, We're Dreaming]]''.

Gonzalez and Fromageau parted ways shortly after touring their second album ''[[Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts]]''.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/m83-mn0000175525 |title=M83 &#124; Music Biography, Streaming Radio and Discography |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2015-07-27}}</ref> Gonzalez records primarily on his own, with other artists as guest musicians. The band is signed to Mute Records and found international success in 2011 with the single "[[Midnight City]]". Their most recent album ''[[DSVII]]'' (the sequel of ''[[Digital Shades Vol. 1]]'') was released on 20 September 2019.

==Career==
===2001–2005===
At the age of 17, Gonzalez bought a synth to record a demo, which he sent to a number of French labels. When the Paris-based [[Gooom Records]] appeared interested, he recruited Nicolas Fromageau to "help me because I didn't feel like I had the shoulders to carry the project on my own".<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url = http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9488-m83/|title = Unrecorded Dreams: Anthony Gonzalez on M83's Early Years|date = 26 August 2014|website = pitchfork.com|publisher = Pitchfork|last = Cohen|first = Ian}}</ref> The band is named after the [[Messier 83|galaxy of the same name]].<ref name=":3" />

In spring 2001, M83 released its [[M83 (album)|self-titled debut album]] recorded on an [[Multitrack recording|8-track]] while Gonzalez was still in college.<ref name=":0" /> The release did not attract much attention outside Europe until September 2005, when [[Mute Records]] reissued the album for a worldwide release. M83's second album ''[[Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts]]'' followed in spring 2003 (and summer 2004 in North America) to widespread critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/m83/deadcitiesredseasandlostghosts/ |title=Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts reviews at |website=Metacritic.com |access-date=29 November 2011}}</ref> After worldwide touring for ''Dead Cities'' resumed, Fromageau left the band; he later formed the band [[Team Ghost]] in 2009.

Gonzalez returned to the studio to record the group's third studio album, ''[[Before the Dawn Heals Us]]'', which was released in January 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.soundsxp.com/1586.shtml|title = M83 Before The Dawn Heals Us|date = 12 February 2005|website = SoundXP.com|last = Roullier|first = Ian}}</ref> The same year, M83 provided a remix of "The Pioneers" by [[Bloc Party]], which was also included on Bloc Party's remix album ''[[Silent Alarm Remixed]]''. M83 also remixed [[Placebo (band)|Placebo]]'s "[[Protège-Moi]]", [[Goldfrapp]]'s "[[Black Cherry (Goldfrapp song)|Black Cherry]]", [[Depeche Mode]]'s "[[Suffer Well]]", [[Van She]]'s "Kelly", and [[The Bumblebeez]]'s "Vila Attack". Similarly, M83's songs have been remixed by Gooom labelmates [[Antoine Bédard|Montag]] and [[Cyann & Ben]].

===2006–2009===
[[File:M83 mp3h1704.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Maulini and Gonzalez from M83 performing at the Pully For Noise festival in 2008]]
In 2006, after the ''Before the Dawn Heals Us'' US tour, Anthony Gonzalez continued to explore a musical direction already heard on earlier M83 tracks and began writing and recording a collection of ambient works.<ref>{{cite web|last=Raper |first=Dan |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/m83-digital-shades-volume-1 |title=M83: Digital Shades Volume 1 – Reviews |website=PopMatters.com |access-date=29 November 2011}}</ref> The album was recorded primarily at his home studio with the assistance of Antoine Gaillet. The resulting project was called ''[[Digital Shades Vol. 1]]'', and was released in September 2007 with a sleeve illustrated by Laurent Fetis (known for his work with [[DJ Hell]], [[Beck]], and [[Tahiti 80]]). It is intended to be part of an ongoing series of ambient works.

''[[Saturdays = Youth]]'', M83's fifth studio album, was released in April 2008. It was recorded with Ken Thomas (known for his work with [[Sigur Rós]], [[The Sugarcubes]], [[Boys in a Band]], [[Cocteau Twins]], and [[Suede (band)|Suede]]), [[Ewan Pearson]] (who has also produced for [[Tracey Thorn]], [[The Rapture (band)|The Rapture]] and [[Ladytron]]) and [[Morgan Kibby]] (of [[The Romanovs (band)|The Romanovs]]). The album features a more focused approach to song structure and form, and Gonzalez stated that the main influence of the album came from music of the 1980s: "I think that '80s music is such a brilliant period for music history. It was the occasion for me to do a tribute to this '80s music, but [it was] also a tribute to my teenage years because the main theme of the album is being a teenager, and being a teenager means a lot to me."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.analoguemagazine.com/interviews/m83-interview/ |title=M83 interview |publisher=Analogue Magazine |date=23 October 2008 |access-date=29 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006201831/http://www.analoguemagazine.com/interviews/m83-interview/ |archive-date=6 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Four singles were released from the album: "Couleurs" in February 2008, "[[Graveyard Girl]]" in April, "[[Kim & Jessie]]" in July, and "We Own the Sky" in December.

Gonzalez, unprovoked, physically assaulted an elderly security guard when Gonzalez attempted to have members of the crowd join him on an unreinforced stage platform. The band later apologized to its fans for the incident. In 2010, on the eve of turning 30, Gonzalez moved to Los Angeles.<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2012/03/09/adule-aux-etats-unis-m83-s-attaque-a-la-france_1655614_3246.html|title=Adulé aux Etats-Unis, M83 s'attaque à la France|last=Davet|first=Stéphane|date=2012-03-09|newspaper=Le Monde.fr|language=fr|issn=1950-6244|access-date=2016-05-20}}</ref>

===2010–2015: ''Hurry Up, We're Dreaming'', ''Oblivion'' and commercial success===
In Spring 2010, M83 composed the score of French director Gilles Marchand's film ''[[L'autre monde|Black Heaven]]''. On 5 July 2010, the ''Black Heaven'' Soundtrack was released, which included two new songs by M83 called "Black Hole" and "Marion's Theme", along with five tracks from his back catalog. The soundtrack also includes songs from the score by Emmanuel D'Orlando, Moon Dailly and John & Jehn. However, his feelings towards the record were largely negative, leaving him depressed.<ref name="pitchfork.com">{{cite web|last=Dombal |first=Ryan |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/40556-m83-talks-very-very-very-epic-new-album/ |title=M83 Talks "Very, Very, Very Epic" New Album &#124; News |website=Pitchfork.com |date=22 November 2010 |access-date=29 November 2011}}</ref>

In 2011, Gonzalez started working on a new batch of songs for an album slated for release later in the year. He described the tracks as darker and "very, very, very epic". Speaking with ''[[Spin Magazine|Spin]]'', he said of the new album "It's a double album. It's mainly about dreams, how every one is different, how you dream differently when you're a kid, a teenager, or an adult. I'm really proud of it. If you're doing a very long album, all the songs need to be different and I think I've done that with this one."<ref name="spinJune62011">{{cite web|title=M83 Reveal Plans for "Epic" Double Album|url=https://www.spin.com/2011/06/m83-reveal-plans-epic-double-album/|work=[[Spin Magazine|Spin]]|access-date=19 July 2011|date=7 June 2011}}</ref> He recorded again with Morgan Kibby as well as others, including [[Medicine (band)|Medicine]]'s mastermind [[Brad Laner]], [[Nine Inch Nails]] bassist [[Justin Meldal-Johnsen]] and [[Zola Jesus]].<ref name="pitchfork.com" />

''[[Hurry Up, We're Dreaming]]'' is Gonzalez's first double album, something he had dreamed of making ever since hearing [[The Smashing Pumpkins]]' ''[[Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness]]''. "I wanted to make a very eclectic album but also something not too long. Making a double album was a dream of mine for a long, long time and I felt ready to make this move," he explains. Discussing the sound and process of creating this album, Gonzalez says it was "written like a soundtrack to an imaginary movie with different ambiances, different atmospheres, different tempos, different orchestrations and different instrumentation.... When I make an album it's always about nostalgia, melancholy in the past and memories."<ref>{{cite web|last=Lindsay |first=Cam |url=http://exclaim.ca/Interviews/FromTheMagazine/m83s_double_standard |title=M83's Double Standard |website=Exclaim.ca |date=2011-10-24 |access-date=2015-07-27}}</ref>

In August 2014, the first three albums produced by the band were re-released by Mute Records with additional material available separately for download.

==Style==
The band's musical aesthetic is characterized by extensive use of reverb effects and lyrics spoken softly over loud instruments. Gonzalez has been inspired by aspects of the [[American Dream]] and his songs have been outlined as themed around "adult-scripted teen dreams".<ref name=":0" /> Inspiration for the 1980s style found in much of Gonzalez's music includes bands such as [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]], [[Pink Floyd]], and [[Tangerine Dream]]. Between various electronic music properties and album artwork, M83's style includes a mix of both contemporary pop and 1980s [[dream pop]].
