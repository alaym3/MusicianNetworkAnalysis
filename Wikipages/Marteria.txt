== Early life ==
Laciny was born to a teacher (mother) and a sailor (father), and spent his childhood in the district of [[Rostock-Lichtenhagen|Lichtenhagen]] in [[Rostock]]. A talented footballer, he played for the youth team of [[F.C. Hansa Rostock]], that he still maintains a close relationship with. He played under [[Horst Hrubesch]] up in the [[Germany national youth football team|U-17 squad]] of the [[Germany national football team|German national football team]].

When he was discovered in 1999 during a trip to New York City by a model scout, he got model assignments all over the world. He worked for [[Diesel (brand)|Diesel]] and [[Hugo Boss]], among others, after which he discontinued his modeling and went back to Rostock to pursue his rap career. 

In 2003, he moved to [[Berlin]]. There, he trained as an actor at a drama school.

== Music career ==
At the age of 16, Marteria was a member of the hip hop group 'Underdog Cru', signed to the label Posin music. At 18, Marteria then signed his first solo contract with Punchline/SPV, and released his debut album. In 2002 he went as part of the Underdog Cru on a European tour with other British and German groups. A year before, in 2001, he performed as part of the Underdog Cru in the largest hip hop and reggae festival in Europe, [[Splash!_(festival)|Splash!]].

Marteria's debut album, ''Halloziehnation'', was praised by the press, and the scene magazine ''[[Juice (magazine)|Juice]]'' awarded 4 1/2 of 6 stars. He then released his second album ''Base Ventura''. These two albums he released on the [[indie label]] Magnum12, where he laid the foundations for his current career. In late 2007, he signed a contract with the music publisher Nesola. In December 2007, under his other pseudonym Marsimoto, he accompanied [[Jan Delay]] as tour support. In early 2008, he signed a label deal with [[Four Music]] (owned by [[Sony Music Entertainment]]). He also founded an own label called Green Berlin.

In addition to his stage name Marteria, he is also known under the pseudonym Marsimoto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rappers.in/Marteria-141_interview.html|title=Interview:Marteria|author=Lupa|date=3 September 2008|publisher=rappers.in|access-date=30 November 2012}}(German){{Dead link|date=August 2021}}</ref> Marsimoto originated as a tribute to [[Quasimoto]] – the alter ego of rapper [[Madlib]] – with an altered high pitched voice. The sound differs considerably from the Marteria sound, as he uses more [[experimental hip hop]], [[Electronic music|electronic]], [[reggae music]] and [[dubstep]] elements as Marsimoto. This [[alter ego]] resulted from a jam session and was later used by Marten Laciny at performances. Due to the positive response, he decided to release albums as Marsimoto. As Marsimoto, he published his solo albums ''Halloziehnation'', ''Zu zweit allein'', ''Grüner Samt'', ''Ring der Nebelungen'' and ''Verde''. A common leitmotif of all Marsimoto albums is the exaggerative consumption of [[Cannabis]].

== Personal life ==
Marteria has one son and currently lives in Berlin's [[Kreuzberg]] district.

He is married to German musician [[Jadu (artist)|Jadu]].
