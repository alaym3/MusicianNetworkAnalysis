'''Third Eye Blind''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], in 1993. After years of lineup changes in the early and mid-1990s, the songwriting duo of [[Stephan Jenkins]] and [[Kevin Cadogan]] signed the band's first major-label recording contract with [[Elektra Records]] in 1996. The band released their [[Third Eye Blind (album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1997, with the band largely consisting of Jenkins (vocals, rhythm guitar), Cadogan (lead guitar), Arion Salazar (bass guitar), and Brad Hargreaves (drums). Shortly after the release of the band's second album in 1999, ''[[Blue (Third Eye Blind album)|Blue]]'', with the same line-up, Cadogan was released from the band under controversial circumstances.

The band continued, but with many line-up changes and long gaps between album releases for the next 15 years. The band released ''[[Out of the Vein]]'' in 2003 and ''[[Ursa Major (album)|Ursa Major]]'' in 2009 with guitarist [[Tony Fredianelli]], but parted ways with him shortly afterwards, leaving only Jenkins and Hargreaves as the remaining core members. The band's lineup stabilized again in the mid-2010s, adding Kryz Reid (lead guitar), Alex Kopp (keyboards), and Alex LeCavalier (bass guitar). The new lineup lead to increased output with less time between releases - ''[[Dopamine (Third Eye Blind album)|Dopamine]]'' (2015), and a string of [[extended play|EP]]s, ''[[We Are Drugs]]'' (2016) and ''[[Thanks for Everything (EP)|Thanks for Everything]]'' (2018). After Kopp was replaced by Colin Creev, a sixth studio album, ''[[Screamer (album)|Screamer]]'' (2019) was released, and a seventh studio album, ''[[Our Bande Apart]]'', was released on September 24, 2021.

The band found commercial success in the late 1990s, with ''Third Eye Blind'' and ''Blue'' certified platinum six times and single platinum in the United States, respectively.<ref name="rockonthenet">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-t/thirdeyeblind_main.htm |title=Third Eye Blind |publisher=Rock On The Net |access-date=2014-04-23}}</ref>  Several songs were a commercial success as well, with "[[Semi-Charmed Life]]", "[[Jumper (Third Eye Blind song)|Jumper]]", and "[[How's It Going to Be]]", all reaching the Top 10 of the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and "[[Never Let You Go (Third Eye Blind song)|Never Let You Go]]" reaching the Top 20. Third Eye Blind has sold around 12 million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/419523/third-eye-blind/chart |title=Third Eye Blind - Chart history |magazine=Billboard |date=2009-08-26 |access-date=2014-04-23}}</ref>

==History==

===Formation and early years: 1990–1996===
The band's origins trace back to the early 1990s, with [[frontman]] [[Stephan Jenkins]] writing music, but struggling to put and hold together a consistent musical lineup.<ref name="BillboardEarly">{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7751391/third-eye-blind-self-titled-debut-album-oral-history|title='There Was No Overnight Success': An Oral History of Third Eye Blind's Self-Titled Debut|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref><ref name="PeopleMagEarly">{{Cite web|url=https://people.com/music/third-eye-blind-bassist-jason-slater-dead-at-49-liver-failure/|title=Original Third Eye Blind Bassist, Jason Slater, Dies at 49 from Liver Failure: Report}}</ref> Originally, Jenkins started his music career as one half of an interracial rap duo "Puck and Natty" with musician Herman Anthony Chunn, who went by the stage name "Zen".<ref name="1999Feature">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Blind-Ambition-Third-Eye-Blind-leader-Stephan-2893749.php|title=Blind Ambition / Third Eye Blind leader Stephan Jenkins makes sure his band is a success|date=November 28, 1999}}</ref> Due to legal issues from the musical group [[Tuck & Patti]], the duo later changed their name to "Puck and Zen".<ref name="1999Feature"/> The two managed to attract some attention from [[record label]]s - enough to get one of their few recorded songs "Just Wanna Be Your Friend" on a soundtrack for the television drama ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]''.<ref name="1999Feature"/> The two were in talks of being signed with [[Capitol Records]], but Jenkins did not see eye to eye on the label's views on the musical direction or what [[music producer]] they would work with, and negotiations fell through.<ref name="1999Feature"/> The group broke up shortly afterwards, and while short-lived, it was in the group that Jenkin's first developed connections in the industry, and wrote the first iteration of what would become Third Eye Blind's biggest hit, "[[Semi-Charmed Life]]".<ref name="1999Feature"/>

After the experience, Jenkins moved into the direction of starting up a rock band instead.<ref name="1999Feature"/> Jenkins recounted that over the span of a few years, he would recruit members, only to have them frequently dropout due to issues like drug addiction or joining other bands.<ref name="BillboardEarly"/> Jenkins would write and workshop early material with musician [[Jason Slater]] for years before the band started up formally, and the two would work together to record the band's first demo together in 1993.<ref name="PeopleMagEarly"/> Jenkins reconnected with music producer and [[sound engineer]] David Gleeson, a contact from his Puck and Natty days, to be able to record demos at professional studios, such as [[Skywalker Ranch]].<ref name="1999Feature"/><ref name="BillboardEarly"/> Gleeson would assist in the sessions, but eventually had a falling out with Jenkins and stopped working with the band.<ref name="1999Feature"/> [[George Earth]] also played guitar on some demos.<ref name="1999Feature"/> Much of the contents of the first demo, such as the track "Hold Me Down", would be scrapped and shelved entirely, but Jenkins would continue to work on some material like "Semi-Charmed Life" or "[[Alright Caroline]]" that would eventually see release.<ref name="PeopleMagEarly"/><ref name="BillboardEarly"/> Around this time, guitarist [[Tony Fredianelli]] would audition for the band as well, though according to Slater, Jenkins believed him to be "too [[heavy metal music|[heavy] metal]]" for the band.<ref name="PeopleMagEarly"/><ref name="THRLegal"/> Around the time frame of 1993 and 1994, Slater would depart the band, while guitarist [[Kevin Cadogan]] and bassist Arion Salazar would join.<ref name="PeopleMagEarly"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://people.com/celebrity/third-eye-blind-lawsuit/|title = Third Eye Blind Lawsuit}}</ref><ref name="BillboardEarly"/> The band cycled through a number of drummers - Adrian Burley, [[Steve Bowman]] ([[Counting Crows]]), and [[Michael Urbano]] ([[Smash Mouth]]).<ref name="PeopleMagEarly"/>

Salazar noted that the band struggled to make much progress prior to the arrival of Cadogan, and felt that the songs really started to develop when Cadogan's big guitar sound was added to Jenkin's more stripped down demos.<ref name="BillboardEarly"/> The two became songwriting partners, with Jenkins writing the lyrics and Cadogan helping him brainstorm musical ideas, and worked on a second set of demos.<ref>Knopper, Steve. [https://books.google.com/books?id=aA4EAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover "Third Eye Blind Sees Promise In Elektra"]. ''Billboard''. March 15, 1997. p. 24.</ref> The band toured locally extensively across 1994 and early 1995, building up a following. However, in July 1995, the band hit a significant setback with a disastrous "Battle of the Bands" performance that would see the winner be offered a record deal. Urbano, the drummer at the time, quit shortly before the show, Jenkins was sick and unable to perform well, and Cadogan blew out his [[guitar amp]] two songs into the show.<ref name="1999Feature"/> They lost the contest, and with it, the potential record deal and the confidence of their current management and studio team, who left the band right afterwards.<ref name="1999Feature"/> On the verge of breaking up, the band instead regrouped, recruited two new key people - a new drummer in [[Brad Hargreaves]], and a new manager, Eric Gotland, a long-time personal friend and confidant of Jenkins.<ref name="1999Feature"/> Jenkins, Cadogan, Salazar, and Hargreaves would go on to be the core lineup for the band during the recording of their first two studio albums.<ref name="BillboardEarly"/>

Through past connections of Slater and Gotland, they were able to start recording a third demo with producer and sound Engineer [[Eric Valentine]], with some additional funding from a partially interested [[RCA Records]], from late 1995 to February 1996.<ref name=Whiting/><ref name="1999Feature"/> Valentine noted that he had heard the demos the band had recorded prior to his arrival, but felt it was "not ready" and needed to be reworked or discarded.<ref name="BillboardEarly"/> He later expressed more satisfaction with material he had worked on.<ref name="1999Feature"/> RCA passed on the band after hearing the material, but the demos instead attracted the attention of [[Arista Records]].<ref name="1999Feature"/>  Label founder [[Clive Davis]] invited the band to perform at a band showcase in [[New York City]] in March 1996.<ref name=Whiting>Whiting, Sam.

Retrieved 2008-03-29.</ref> During Third Eye Blind concerts at the time, it was customary for the band to have a [[piñata]] release candy above their [[Moshing|mosh pits]], yet at the showcase for the record executives, lead singer Jenkins released live crickets from the piñata instead.<ref name=Whiting/> Cadogan noted that the performance was ultimately not successful, and Davis passed on signing the band, but the event built hype and notoriety for the band, and Salazar noted that the well-developed, 14 song demo they had recorded with Valentine still had helped the band feel more prepared to deal with record labels.<ref name="BillboardEarly"/> In April 1996, after Jenkins had challenged [[Epic Records]] executive Dave Massey in a meeting, the band landed an opening gig for [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] at the [[Bill Graham Civic Auditorium|San Francisco Civic Auditorium]].<ref name=Whiting/> In an unlikely scenario for an opening act, the band was invited back for an encore after playing their initial set<ref name="1997Feature">Ganahl, Jane.

Retrieved 2008-03-29.</ref> Afterwards, the band found themselves in a bidding war among record labels, and after another showcase in June 1996 in [[Los Angeles]], the band signed a contract with [[Sylvia Rhone]] of [[Elektra Records]] because they believed it offered the most artistic freedom.<ref name=Condon/> It was later reported as the largest publishing deal ever for an unsigned artist at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/third-eye-blind/id733629 |title=iTunes - Music - Third Eye Blind |website=Itunes.apple.com |access-date=2014-04-23}}</ref> Throughout this, the band had continued to work on their music, with much of the album being largely put together prior to being signed to Elektra. Some iterations of songs were even asked to be redone to be more similar to the original demos.<ref name="BillboardEarly"/>

===Debut album ''Third Eye Blind'': 1997–1998===
While the band had finally accomplished their goal of getting signed, troubles persisted with the band. Jenkins and Valentine clashed; Valentine was hired as a sound engineer, but felt he was tasked with duties that a full-fledged music producer would do, without the pay that would normally come with the role.<ref name="1999Feature"/> Valentine ended up getting a co-production credit, but people involved felt he did far more for the album than technically credited for.<ref name="1999Feature"/> Valentine also criticized Jenkins's decision to buyout all of Zen's early contribution to album material. Jenkins contended that he heavily reworked any of Zen's contributions.<ref name="1999Feature"/> Cadogan also became disillusioned throughout the recording sessions. His understanding was that his role in the band was of an equal partnership with Jenkins, but did not feel he was treated as such.<ref name="NYT2002"/> Valentine reported that while Jenkins and Cadogan recorded good material together, they were constantly at odds with one another in the studio, with their relationship deteriorating over time as they finished the album.<ref name="NYT2002">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/20/arts/the-pop-life-a-part-of-a-band-as-the-whole-band.html|title = The POP LIFE; A Part of a Band as the Whole Band|newspaper = The New York Times|date = June 20, 2002|last1 = Strauss|first1 = Neil}}</ref> Additionally, unbeknownst to the rest of the band until years later, even though both Cadogan and Jenkins were signed to the deal from the record label, days prior to the signing, Jenkins secretly set up a Third Eye Blind Inc" as a corporation, and named himself the sole owner and shareholder, giving him complete control over all legal and financial matters in the band.<ref name="NYT2002"/>

Despite the issues, the band's debut album, ''[[Third Eye Blind (album)|Third Eye Blind]]'', was finished and released in April 1997.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theringer.com/2017/4/6/16042244/third-eye-blind-20th-anniversary-semi-charmed-life-xeb-1f6cb7524abc|title="This is as Much Our Story as Anybody Else's"|date=April 6, 2017}}</ref> As a new artist, album did not particularly debut high in the US all-format [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album's chart, and only ever peaked at number 25 on the chart, but consistently sold each week, staying on the chart for over a year straight.<ref name="AllMBio">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/third-eye-blind-mn0000926237/biography|title = Third Eye Blind Biography, Songs, & Albums|website = [[AllMusic]]}}</ref><ref>"Third Eye Blind".

As the process would drag on, privately, internal strife would flare up again across 2008.<ref name="THRLegal"/> According to Fredianelli, morale was low at the time due to the departure of Salazar, Jenkins beginning to lose interest in the band, and tensions between Jenkins and long-time friend and band manager Eric Godtland.<ref name="THRLegal"/><ref name="RMRetrospective"/> Jenkins fired Godtland and sued him, accusing him of not paying Jenkins enough, and Godtland in turn counter-sued him, responding that the lower pay was due to lessened productivity by the band, a fault of Jenkins himself, not Godtland, and this had caused an unfair decrease in pay for Godtland himself.<ref name="RMRetrospective"/> Fredianelli then claimed that Jenkins insisted that the rest of the band also join in and file lawsuits against Godtland too, threatening to abandon the band if they didn't.<ref name="THRLegal"/> Fredianelli, not wanting to abandon the band after all the work done on the long-awaited album, went along with Jenkin's plan, creating a deposition against Godtland, creating friction between the two.<ref name="THRLegal"/> As months passed, Fredianelli felt guilt about it, and apologized to Godtland, offering to change his deposition, then angering Jenkins in return.<ref name="THRLegal"/> Jenkins lawsuit was eventually dismissed, and Godtland settled his case out of court.<ref name="RMRetrospective"/> The band's touring manager would unceremoniously quit shortly after.<ref name="RMRetrospective"/>

Additionally, for the first time, a fifth official member, Alex Kopp, was brought on as a dedicated [[keyboardist]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Condran|first1=Ed|title=Third Eye Blind a '90s band with staying power|url=http://www.mcall.com/entertainment/music/mc-third-eye-blind-bethlehem-levitt-steelstacks-20140918-story.html|website=[[The Morning Call]]|accessdate=4 May 2015|date=18 September 2014}}</ref> Work on a fifth album continued, with earliest reports showing plans for a 2011 release, but writer's block continued to hamper Jenkins ability to complete lyrics for songs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shotwell|first1=James|title=Third Eye Blind enter studio|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/third_eye_blind_enter_studio|website=[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]|accessdate=4 May 2015|date=6 June 2010|archive-date=November 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116181601/http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/third_eye_blind_enter_studio|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="ChicagoTribune"/> The only newly recorded studio music the band would release for years was the [[impromptu]]-written "If There Ever Was a Time" song released in support of the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement in November 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/entertainment-news/article/third-eye-blind-releases-occupy-wall-street-anthem/9801567 |title=Third Eye Blind Releases Occupy Wall Street Anthem |publisher= ARTISTdirect  |access-date=2012-04-27}}</ref> Moving into 2012, with writer's block continuing to hinder the process, Jenkins would begin to advertise the album as the band's last, feeling that the volume and structure of the album format was what made the writing process dificult for him.<ref name="ChicagoTribune"/> By the end of the year, the band did a short tour in [[India]] to help inspire the writing process; the band was far enough along to announce they were shooting a music video for a track.<ref name="RSI">{{cite web|url=http://rollingstoneindia.com/third-eye-blind-to-shoot-music-video-in-mumbai/ |title=Third Eye Blind To Shoot Music Video In Mumbai |work=Rolling Stone India |date= November 27, 2012|accessdate=2015-07-22}}</ref> However, the album's release continued to be delayed from 2013<ref>{{cite web|author1=Trace William Cowen |title=Re-Reviews: Third Eye Blind's 'Blue' |url=https://www.glidemagazine.com/114129/re-reviews-third-eye-blinds-blue/ |website=Glide Magazine |accessdate=4 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150508232418/http://www.glidemagazine.com/114129/re-reviews-third-eye-blinds-blue/ |archivedate=8 May 2015 |date=15 November 2013 |url-status=bot: unknown }}</ref> to 2014<ref>{{cite web|author1=Angel J Melendez|title=We Were There – Concert Review: Third Eye Blind at Revolution Live|url=http://www.fuzzyheadphonez.com/we-were-there-concert-review-third-eye-blind-at-revolution-live|website=FuzzyHeadphonez|accessdate=4 May 2015|date=21 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608173339/http://www.fuzzyheadphonez.com/we-were-there-concert-review-third-eye-blind-at-revolution-live/|archivedate=8 June 2015}}</ref> to 2015.<ref name="miamiherald">{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/entertainment/celebrities/article23026260.html |title=Alt rockers Third Eye Blind high on life |work=Miami Herald |date=2015-06-03 |accessdate=2015-07-22}}</ref> Writers block continued to be cited as the reason by Jenkins,<ref name="fdrmx">{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Lisa|title=Third Eye Blind Tour w/ Dashboard Confessional|url=http://fdrmx.com/third-eye-blind-tour-w-dashboard-confessional|website=FDRMX|accessdate=4 May 2015|date=10 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318063510/http://fdrmx.com/third-eye-blind-tour-w-dashboard-confessional/|archivedate=18 March 2015}}</ref> though Hargreaves also noted that their past successes had afforded them the luxury of taking their time on material without having to rush it due to financial matters.<ref name="diff1">{{cite web|author= |url=http://diffuser.fm/third-eye-blinds-brad-hargreaves-on-dopamine-why-it-may-be-their-last-album/ |title=Third Eye Blind's Brad Hargreaves on Their New Album |website=Diffuser.fm |date= |accessdate=2015-07-22}}</ref>
