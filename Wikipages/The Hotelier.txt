==History==
===Early years and ''It Never Goes Out'' (2009–14)===
The Hotelier formed in June 2009 when lead singer Christian Holden met Chris Hoffman, Zack Shaw, and Sam Frederick while attending high school in [[Dudley, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sanneh|first1=Kelefa|title=Suburban Renewal|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/01/suburban-renewal|publisher=New Yorker|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>

In 2009, the band released their first EP, titled ''We Are All Alone'',<ref name=WAAL>{{cite web|url=http://thehotelyear.bandcamp.com/album/we-are-all-alone|title=We Are All Alone - The Hotelier|date=10 June 2009|work=The Hotelier|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref> which received little success outside of Massachusetts. At the end of the year, the band released ''Two Song Demo''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehotelyear.bandcamp.com/album/two-song-demo|title=Two Song Demo - The Hotelier|date=25 December 2009|work=The Hotelier|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref> In 2011, the band released their first album, titled ''[[It Never Goes Out]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehotelyear.bandcamp.com/album/it-never-goes-out|title=It Never Goes Out - The Hotelier|date=2 January 2011|work=The Hotelier|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref> receiving some attention.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interviews: Christian Holden (The Hotelier)|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/54831/interviews-christian-holden-the-hotelier|publisher=Punk News|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>

Originally named The Hotel Year, the band changed its name because they did not think the name was particularly good, and there was a band called My Hotel Year which they did not want to be confused with.<ref name="namechanged">{{cite web|last1=Cooke|first1=Shawn|title=Lead singer of The Hotelier talks ambiguity, imagines the worst|url=http://pittnews.com/article/5653/archives/lead-singer-of-the-hotelier-talks-ambiguity-imagines-the-worst/|website=The Pitt News|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=20 June 2016|ref=namechanged}}</ref>

===''Home, Like Noplace Is There'' (2014–15)===
The band released their second album in 2014 titled ''[[Home, Like Noplace Is There]]'', which brought the band to attention in the [[emo revival]] scene.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Slessor|first1=Dan|title=The Hotelier - Home, Like Noplace Is There|url=http://www.altpress.com/reviews/entry/the_hotelier_home_like_noplace_is_there|publisher=Alternative Press|accessdate=25 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Ian|title=The Hotelier - Home, Like Noplace Is There|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18963-the-hotelier-home-like-noplace-is-there/|publisher=Pitchfork|accessdate=25 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Blest|first1=Paul|title=The Hotelier Want to Cut Through the Bro Culture Crap|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/the-hotelier-interview|publisher=Vice|accessdate=25 December 2014}}</ref> After releasing the album, vocalist Christian Holden stated in a blog post on the bands [[Tumblr]] that "Our new album deals with some real dark stuff. So to all my brooding and slightly damaged friends, have your a happy album or Rugrats in Paris nearby. It’s partly about my experience with friends and loved ones in the past three years which were very complicated, toxic, and abusive. But laid within is a lot about the deconstruction of self for personal growth and transformation. I hope it helps you live and stuff.
