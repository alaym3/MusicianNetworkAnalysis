He is best known for his platinum-selling [[single (music)|single]] "Walk", which peaked at number 20 on the [[Bubbling Under Hot 100|''Billboard'' Bubbling Under Hot 100]] chart and "Bands" with [[Rich the Kid]]. Both songs were included on his well-received debut mixtape, ''Bawskee'' (2018).<ref name="Derek" />

''Bawskee'' was followed up by three sequels; ''[[Bawskee 2]]'', ''[[Bawskee 3.5]]'' and ''Bawskee 4''.<ref name="Derek" /> His debut album, ''[[Pandemic (album)|Pandemic]]'', was released in early 2020 to mainly positive critical reception.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uproxx.com/music/best-new-hip-hop-albums-this-week-july-26-2019/|title=All The Best New Hip-Hop Albums Coming Out This Week|last=Williams|first=Aaron|publisher=[[Uproxx]]|date=July 25, 2019|accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref> In 2019, he was an ''XXL'' Freshman and performed his cypher alongside rappers [[Roddy Ricch]] and [[Tierra Whack]].

==Career==
Comethazine began posting his music on audio distribution platform [[SoundCloud]] and video distribution platform [[Spotify]] as a teenager, allowing him to quit his job as a mechanic to focus on music full-time.<ref name="xxl">{{cite web |url=https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/04/comethazine-interview-the-break/ |title=The Break Presents: Comethazine |last=Seabrook III |first=Robby |date=6 April 2018 |website=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]] |access-date=11 March 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vfiles.com/news/vfiles-premiere-comethazine-has-a-death-wish |title=VFILES Premiere: Comethazine Has a Death Wish |date=9 November 2017 |website=VFILES |access-date=11 March 2019 }}</ref>

In early 2018, a feature on SoundCloud that allows their original sound file to be switched was abused for an unofficial upload of [[YBN Nahmir]]'s song "Bounce Out with That", that was replaced with his song "Bands", causing it to acquire the chart data of "Bounce Out with That".<ref>{{cite news |last=Moore |first=Matthew |date=19 February 2018 |title=Fake the music and dance: pop song dodge boosts ratings |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/fake-the-music-and-dance-pop-song-dodge-boosts-ratings-x6cnc38xn |work=[[The Times]] |access-date=12 March 2019 }}</ref> It is unclear who perpetrated this, though the account associated with the switch has since been removed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/02/other-sites-have-fake-news-so-soundcloud-has-fake-music.html |title=Other Sites Have Fake News, So SoundCloud Has Fake Music |last=Guan |first=Frank |date=12 February 2018 |website=Vulture |access-date=11 March 2019 }}</ref> This incident helped increase the popularity of "Bands".

On March 27, 2020, Comethazine's debut studio album, ''[[Pandemic (album)|Pandemic]]'', was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.55150/title.comethazine-shares-pandemic-album|title=Comethazine Shares 'Pandemic' Album|work=HipHopDX|author=Justin Ivey|date=March 27, 2020|accessdate=March 31, 2020}}</ref> His next project, ''Bawskee 4'' followed on October 23, 2020, preceded by the music videos for "We Gone Win", "Air Max", and "Derek Jeter".<ref name="Derek" /> Comethazine shot another music video for the song, "556", and released the entire album alongside it.

In late December 2020, Comethazine announced that his upcoming album would be titled ''[[Comethazine the Album]]''. He directed and shot a television show called ''Doogie''. It will premiere on [[Amazon Prime Video]] on a date that is TBD.

On October 22, 2021, ''Comethazine the Album'' was released. It was promoted with the singles "Spinback" and "Six Flags".<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-10-22|title=Comethazine Is Content With Being A Lone Wolf On "Comethazine The Album"|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/comethazine-is-content-with-being-a-lone-wolf-on-comethazine-the-album-new-mixtape.122090.html|access-date=2021-10-23|website=HotNewHipHop|language=en}}</ref>

==Musical style and influences==
Comethazine's music has been compared as a mixture of [[Playboi Carti]], [[Smokepurpp]] and [[Tay-K]], and has been referred to as anti-melody, a derivative form of trap that uses the bass as a source of melody instead of traditional instrumentation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fordhamram.com/66770/culture/comethazine-and-the-rise-of-anti-melody/ |title=Comethazine and the Rise of Anti-Melody |last=Press-Reynolds |first=Kieran |date=13 February 2019 |website=The Fordham Ram |access-date=11 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328005022/https://fordhamram.com/66770/culture/comethazine-and-the-rise-of-anti-melody/ |archive-date=28 March 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He has cited rappers such as [[Big Mike (rapper)|Big Mike]], [[Pimp C]], [[Chingy]], [[Jadakiss]], [[Special Ed]], [[Chief Keef]], [[Playboi Carti]], [[Eminem]], [[Waka Flocka Flame]], [[50 Cent]], and [[Jim Jones (rapper)|Jim Jones]] as musical influences.<ref name="xxl" />
