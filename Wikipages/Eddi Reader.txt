'''Sadenia "Eddi" Reader''' [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (born 29 August 1959)<ref name=ERNet>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eddireader.net/eddibiog.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 August 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091105134724/http://www.eddireader.net/eddibiog.htm |archive-date=5 November 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> is a Scottish singer-songwriter, known for her work as frontwoman of [[Fairground Attraction]] and for an enduring solo career. She is the recipient of three [[BRIT Awards]]. In 2003, she showcased the works of [[Scotland]]'s national poet, [[Robert Burns]].

==Early career==
Reader was born in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, the daughter of a [[welding|welder]], and the eldest of seven children<ref>{{cite news |url=http://living.scotsman.com/features/Q--A-with-Eddi.3359115.jp |access-date=18 April 2009 |date=1 April 2007 |first=Lynn |last=O'Rourke |title=Q & A with Eddi Reader |work=[[The Scotsman]]}}</ref> (her brother, [[Francis Reader|Francis]], is vocalist with the band [[The Trash Can Sinatras]]). She was nicknamed Edna by her parents. Living at first in the district of [[Anderston]], in a tenement slum demolished in 1965, the young Reader family moved to a two-bedroomed flat in the estate of [[Arden, Glasgow|Arden]].<ref name=schooldays>[https://www.scotsman.com/education/my-schooldays-eddie-reader-1-568094 My Schooldays: Eddie Reader], The Scotsman, 22 May 2002</ref>

In 1976, due to overcrowding, the family was re-housed 25 miles from Glasgow, in a council development in [[Irvine, Scotland|Irvine]], [[North Ayrshire]]. However, Reader returned to Glasgow (where she lived with her grandmother in [[Pollok]]) to finish her compulsory schooling.<ref name=schooldays/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.eddireader.co.uk/discs/eddi_burns.pdf |access-date=18 April 2009 |date=12 May 2003 |title=Sings the songs of Robert Burns |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119140144/http://www.eddireader.co.uk/discs/eddi_burns.pdf |archive-date=19 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> She began playing the guitar at the age of ten, and started her musical career [[busking]], first in Glasgow's [[Sauchiehall Street]], then in the early 1980s in London and around Europe (where she also worked with [[circus]] and performance artists).

Back in Scotland, while finding factory work in Irvine and working part-time in Sirocco Recording Studio in [[Kilmarnock]], she answered an advert in the music press and travelled to London to audition and join the [[Punk rock|punk]] band [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]], who needed a backing singer for their appearance on British television music show ''[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]]'' and for their UK tour. This led to her first US tour with the band. After returning to the UK and leaving the band, she started working as a [[Session musician|session vocalist]] in London, picking up work singing jingles for radio advertisements and singing with such acts as [[Eurythmics]], [[The Waterboys]], [[Billy MacKenzie]], [[John Foxx]] and [[Alison Moyet]].<ref name=NME>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/artists/eddi-reader|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091121102315/http://www.nme.com/artists/eddi-reader|url-status=dead|title=Eddi Reader at ''NME''|archive-date=21 November 2009}}</ref>

==Fairground Attraction==
{{Main|Fairground Attraction}}
In 1984, Reader returned to the UK from Paris, where she had been working as a singer for the composer [[Vladimir Cosma]]. Through her contact with the brass section session players [[The Kick Horns]] in London, she signed a contract with [[EMI]], and recorded two singles with the [[disco]] group Outbar Squeek. Around the same time, she met and asked [[Mark E. Nevin]], a guitarist and songwriter from the band Jane Aire and the Belvederes to write for her and they recorded two songs as 'The Academy of Fine Popular Music'.  They subsequently formed [[Fairground Attraction]], together with [[Simon Edwards]] ([[Guitarrón mexicano|guitarrón]] – a Mexican acoustic bass guitar) and Roy Dodds (drums & percussion). In 1988 the band signed to [[RCA]]/[[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] records and released their first single, "[[Perfect (Fairground Attraction song)|Perfect]]", which became a UK number one,<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=999|title-link=Encyclopedia of Popular Music}}</ref> winning best single at the 1989 [[BRIT Awards]].  Their first album, ''[[The First of a Million Kisses]]'', was also a success, reaching number two in the [[UK Albums Chart]], and winning best album at the 1989 Brits.

This success was short-lived, however. In November 1989, after a break, during which Reader had her first child, Charlie, with her French-Algerian partner Milou, arguments arose within the group, and Nevin abandoned a recording session for the second album, which eventually led to the splitting of the band.<ref name="Larkin"/> A makeshift second album, a collection of [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] and live tracks, ''Ay Fond Kiss'', was rushed out the following year.

==Solo career==

===''Mirmama'' and ''Eddi Reader'' (1992–1994)===
Reader returned to Scotland, but before she embarked on her solo career she took a temporary detour into acting. She played Jolene Jowett, a singer and [[accordion]]ist, in John Byrne's [[Your Cheatin' Heart (TV series)|''Your Cheatin' Heart'']], a comedy-drama series for [[BBC Television]], set in the [[country music]] scene in Scotland. In 1993 Reader was the presenter of [[BBC Scotland]]'s [[No Stilettos]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12574132.Rock_makes_a_point_with_No_Stilettos/|title=Rock makes a point with No Stilettos|website=HeraldScotland|access-date=21 May 2018}}</ref> a music performance programme recorded in Glasgow. Her other acting credits include playing the part of ''Joy 3'' from the [[Michael Boyd (director)|Michael Boyd]] (artistic director of the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]) production of Janice Galloway's ''The Trick Is to Keep Breathing''.<ref name="Larkin"/> This was a [[BBC Radio 4]] production in 1996 and also a [[Tron Theatre]] production the same year.

Returning to London, Reader worked on new material with a backing band calling itself The Patron Saints of Imperfection (made up of Roy Dodds, Neill and Calum MacColl, and Phil Steriopoulos).<ref name="Larkin"/> This became her first solo album, recorded for [[RCA Records]]: 1992's ''[[Mirmama]]''.<ref name="Larkin"/> She met [[Geoff Travis]] who signed her to [[Warner Brothers]] subsidiary label, [[Blanco Y Negro]].<ref name="Larkin"/> The managing director Rob Dickens executively produced her second solo album ''[[Eddi Reader (album)|Eddi Reader]]'' (1994), which won her the "Best female singer" BRIT Award that year, followed by ''[[Candyfloss and Medicine]]'' (1996), and ''[[Angels & Electricity]]'' (1998).<ref name="Larkin"/> She parted from Warner Brothers and continued her work on Geoff Travis' [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]] label when she recorded  ''[[Simple Soul]]'' (2001) and ''[[Driftwood (album)|Driftwood]]'' (2002) – a "homegrown" release of songs recorded during the ''Simple Soul'' sessions. During this time, Reader also recorded the song "Ocean Love" for the soundtrack of the animated Danish film ''[[Help! I'm a Fish]]'' (2001).{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Reader also contributed vocals to one of [[Big Country]]'s final singles before [[Stuart Adamson]]'s death, "[[Fragile Thing]]".

===''Sings the Songs of Robert Burns'' (1994–2007)===

Reader continued to tour (England, Scotland, Japan, Australia, Spain, the United States, and Ireland). In 2003, she recorded her [[Sings the Songs of Robert Burns|album of material by Robert Burns]], with the [[Royal Scottish National Orchestra]], leading to good reviews and an international resurgence in interest in Scotland's "[[bard]]".<ref name=Guardian16May2003>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/may/16/artsfeatures.robertburns |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=16 May 2003 |access-date=4 April 2009 |first=Will |last=Hodgkinson |title=Life performers}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/pop/159017_hotcd03.html |access-date=4 April 2009 |date=3 February 2004 |first=Bill |last=White |title='Songs of Robert Burns' a magnificent gift from the heart of Scotland |work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]}}</ref>

In 2004, Reader sang at the re-opening of the new [[Scottish Parliament]] building, where she was presented to [[Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Building Opens |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/visitandlearn/16171.aspx |publisher=The Scottish Parliament |access-date=12 May 2014}}</ref> She has described the experience: "I was honoured to sing at the opening of the parliament although I almost didn’t get to. I wanted to sing ‘[[Auld Lang Syne]]' as I thought that would have been perfect for the politicians with everyone shaking hands but they wanted me to sing it in 'F’ key and that wasn't the key for me so I told them I wasn't doing it. It was only at the last minute that I eventually agreed."<ref>{{cite news |last=Biagi |first=Marco |title=Eddi Reader chats to The Edinburgh Reporter ahead of Usher Hall concert |url=http://www.theedinburghreporter.co.uk/2013/11/eddi-reader-chats-to-the-edinburgh-reporter-ahead-of-usher-hall-concert/ |access-date=12 May 2014 |newspaper=The Edinburgh Reporter |date=26 November 2013}}</ref>

She spent April 2006 touring Australia with [[Boo Hewerdine]] and Alan Kelly, following the release of ''St Clare's Night Out: Live at The Basement'', with Australian acts such as David Hosking invited to open the concerts.

Reader's eighth studio album, ''[[Peacetime (album)|Peacetime]]'', was released in 2007 on the [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]] record label. Produced by fellow Scottish [[folk music|folk]] musician, [[John McCusker]], the album features a few Burns composed songs, alongside original material with long-time collaborator [[Boo Hewerdine]] and [[The Trash Can Sinatras]]' John Douglas.

===''Love Is the Way'' (2008–2010)===

In spring 2008, Reader was a special guest at the [[Hotel Cafe Tour]] hosted by [[Tom McRae]]. In 2009, she performed in period-drama ''[[Me and Orson Welles]]'',<ref name="Eddi Reader Filmography (IMDb.com)">"[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0713916/filmoyear Filmography by year for Eddi Reader]". Internet Movie Database. Retrieved 18 February 2012.</ref> directed by [[Richard Linklater]] and starring [[Zac Efron]], [[Christian McKay]] and [[Claire Danes]].<ref name="myspace.com">{{Cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/eddireader/blog/431672826|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121202072047/http://www.myspace.com/eddireader/blog/431672826|url-status=dead|title=Me and Orson Welles von Eddi Reader bei Myspace|website=Archive.today|archive-date=2 December 2012|access-date=3 October 2019}}</ref> Reader performed re-arranged 1930s standards, with [[Jools Holland]], with whom she had previously collaborated on the single "Waiting Game".

To commemorate the 250th anniversary of Robert Burns' birth, Reader released ''[[The Songs of Robert Burns Deluxe Edition]]'' in January 2009. The new release brought together the original Burns album with seven additional songs, two from the original 2003 sessions ("Green Grow the Rashes O", "Of A' the Airts"), three from 2007's ''[[Peacetime (album)|Peacetime]]'' ("Ye banks and Braes", "Aye Waukin O" and "Leezie Lindsay") the unreleased "Dainty Davie", also from that session, and a brand new recording, "Comin' Thro the Rye/Dram Behind the Curtain". The new album was promoted, like the original release, with two sold-out shows at the annual [[Celtic Connections]] festival in Glasgow.

In 2009 Reader released her ninth studio album, ''[[Love is the Way]]'', which was self-produced. In a special arrangement with record label [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]] she sold an exclusive, pre-released and minimally-packaged version of the disc on her 19-date autumn 2008 UK tour.<ref name="MySpaceBlog">{{Cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/eddireader/blog/432637439|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121205200227/http://www.myspace.com/eddireader/blog/432637439|url-status=dead|title=LOVE IS THE WAY – PRE-RELEASE EXCLUSIVE FOR UPCOMING TOUR! von Eddi Reader bei Myspace|website=Archive.today|archive-date=5 December 2012|access-date=3 October 2019}}</ref>

===''Vagabond'' and recent work (2010–present)===

In early 2010, Reader appeared on the Irish language album ''[[Ceol '10 Súil Siar]]'', singing an Irish language version of the [[Fairground Attraction]] song "Perfect" called "Foirfe". In December she released a live album on her own label and sold exclusively via her online store, ''Live in Japan''. Recorded from the sound desk at her Japan shows in September 2009, it was mastered and mixed by Mark Freegard who had worked on the 2009 album ''[[Love is the Way]]''.

==Personal life==
In 2013, Reader married John Douglas, a songwriter and member of [[The Trashcan Sinatras]].

===Politics===
{{quote box|bgcolor=#CCDDFF | align=right | width=25%|quote=No decent English human being can fail to see how this 'union' is flawed from the English side. There is a distinct difference between walking... side by side... arm in arm. Or being as ignored as the lint in the back pocket of English psyche.

Reader is writing a book for publication about her great-uncle Seamus (or James) Reader, who was head of the Scottish Brigade of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]], when the [[Irish War of Independence]] broke out in 1919, later becoming a founder of the abortive Scottish Republican Army, which attempted to replicate the Irish struggle in Scotland between the wars.<ref name="belfast telegraph">{{cite news |title=Eddi Reader: still going for the Burns |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/news/eddi-reader-still-going-for-the-burns-29947910.html |access-date=12 May 2014 |newspaper=The Belfast Telegraph |date=24 January 2014}}</ref> On Facebook, she posted that he: "was in command of 4,000 Scots involved in the Irish Rising build-up and the Irish war against The British state. In telling the story I felt my ancestor was passing the baton to me to tell the truthful story of this time".<ref name=peterkin />  Reader has been an advocate for the [[Yes Scotland]] movement, campaigning for a Yes vote in the referendum for [[Scottish independence]] from the United Kingdom.<ref name=small>{{cite news |last=Small |first=Mike |title=Who better to convince Scots to reject independence than English celebrities? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/07/scots-independence-union-english-better-together |access-date=12 May 2014 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=7 January 2014}}</ref>

Her 2013 appearance on the British TV programme ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' was publicly criticised,<ref>{{cite news |last=McCartney |first=Jenny |title=Scottish independence: There's a kind of magic in our united kingdom |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/10485285/Scottish-independence-Theres-a-kind-of-magic-in-our-united-kingdom.html |access-date=12 May 2014 |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=30 November 2013}}</ref> with one viewer threatening on Twitter to cut her tongue out.<ref name=martin>{{cite news |last=Martin |first=Kate |title=Why is the Scottish independence debate dominated by men? |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/12/why-scottish-independence-debate-dominated-men |access-date=12 May 2014 |newspaper=New Statesman |date=11 December 2013}}</ref>
Reader has said she is "an egalitarian who believes in the autonomy of small nations, it's unconscionable that those who call people 'nationalists' for wanting their country to manage its own wealth, do not recognise the 'nationalistic' choice of supporting a 'BRITISH nation'".
Reader said that, in reprisal for her advocacy for Scottish independence, [[David Steel|Lord David Steel]] said in a debate on Scottish independence in the [[House of Lords]] that Reader's work on Robert Burns was "murdering Burns' simple melodies".  Reader also said that the newspaper ''[[The Scotsman]]'', in reprisal for Reader choosing to advocate a Yes vote, had published a story mischaracterising her political views and misrepresenting her great-uncle as a [[Nazi]] and leader in the [[Irish Republican Army]],<ref name=peterkin>{{cite news |last=Peterkin |first=Tom |title=Eddi Reader reveals great-uncle's life as IRA chief |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/eddi-reader-reveals-great-uncle-s-life-as-ira-chief-1-3117293 |access-date=12 May 2014 |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=29 September 2013}}</ref> stating: "there’s people out there in Scotland, especially in the Press, and especially at The Scotsman — which is a very wrong name for that paper, because they don’t believe in Scotland at all; they believe in London management — who believe that Scots do not deserve the vote. I don’t want to be in that team."<ref name="belfast telegraph" /> She issued a formal appeal to the [[Press Complaints Commission]] (PCC), saying that: "The article was trying to portray ALL people wanting to have Scots running Scotland and independence voters as having links with the early Fascists. The journalist scrapped around and tried to attach my great-uncle, who supported independence, to a 'Nazi' group and a terrorist organisation, creating hateful responses and threats to my family."<ref name=newsnew>{{cite news |title=Musician's anger at newspaper 'Swastika Revenge' smear |url=https://newsnet.scot/archive/musicians-anger-at-newspaper-swastika-revenge-smear/ |access-date=12 May 2014 |newspaper=Newsnet Scotland |date=3 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007102334/http://newsnetscotland.com/index.php/scottish-news/8121-musicians-anger-at-newspaper-swastika-revenge-smear |archive-date=7 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The PCC ruled in May 2013 that the image in the story, accompanied by the headline ‘Klan Alba’, did not breach the Editor’s Code of Practice.<ref name=newsnew/>
