Many of their modern hymns are rooted in the traditions of old [[Celtic music|Celtic]] and English hymns.

=== ''In Christ Alone'' album ===
The duo's debut release was ''In Christ Alone'', released in 2006. This record was a collection of Getty's best known ten hymns remade with Kristyn as the vocalist.

After a total [[Record distribution|distribution]] of approximately 200,000 units, ''In Christ Alone'' was nominated for a [[GMA Dove Award|Dove Award]] in 2007. "The Risen Christ", a choral collection based on the album, was also nominated for a Dove Award in 2009.<ref>[http://www.christiantoday.com/article/keith.and.kristyn.getty.return.to.irish.roots.with.new.release/23927.htm Keith and Kristyn Getty return to Irish roots with new release] at Christian Media Corporation; published 5 August 2009; retrieved 9 October 2015</ref>

Appearances included working with [[Billy Graham|Billy Graham Evangelical Association]] on two festivals with [[Franklin Graham]],<ref>[http://billygraham.org/decision-magazine/september-2006/making-disciples/ at Billy Graham Evangelistic Association]; published 8 September 2006; retrieved 9 October 2015</ref> appearances at [[Royal Albert Hall]], Pentagon, [[National Prayer Breakfast]] Media Dinner as well as two top ten inspirational Christian radio hits ("Higher Throne" and "Power of the Cross").
