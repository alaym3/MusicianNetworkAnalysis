'''The O'Jays''' are an American [[R&B]] group from [[Canton, Ohio]], formed in 1958 and originally consisting of [[Eddie Levert]] (born  June 16, 1942), Walter Lee Williams (born  August 25, 1943), William Powell (January 20, 1942 &ndash; May 26, 1977), Bobby Massey (born 1942, Canton) and Bill Isles (January 4, 1941  &ndash; March 28, 2019).<ref>{{cite web |title=Obituary: William Carvan Isles II, co-founder of The O'Jays, dies at 78 |url=https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/entertainment/music/story/2019-04-05/obituary-the-ojays-co-founder-william-carvan-isles-ii-has-died-at-the-age-of-78 |website=San Diego Union-Tribune |access-date=10 April 2019 |date=5 April 2019}}</ref>  The O'Jays made their first chart appearance with the minor hit "Lonely Drifter" in 1963, but reached their greatest level of success once [[Gamble & Huff]], a team of producers and songwriters, signed them to their [[Philadelphia International]] label in 1972. With Gamble & Huff, the O'Jays (now a trio after the departure of Isles and Massey) emerged at the forefront of [[Philadelphia soul]] with "[[Back Stabbers (song)|Back Stabbers]]" (1972), and topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100]] the following year with "[[Love Train]]". Several other US R&B hits followed, and the O'Jays were inducted into the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] in 2004, and [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2005, and in 2013 they were inducted into National Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame.

==Career==

The group was formed in Canton, Ohio, in 1958 while its members were attending [[Canton McKinley High School]]. Originally known as '''The Mascots,''' and then '''The Triumphs,'''<ref name="LarkinSM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Soul Music]]|editor-first=Colin|editor-last=Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|location=London, England|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-733-9|page=184}}</ref> the friends began recording with "Miracles" in 1961, which was a moderate hit in the [[Cleveland]] area. In 1963, they took the name 'The O'Jays', in tribute to Cleveland radio disc jockey Eddie O'Jay, who was part of the powerful management team of [[Frankie Crocker]], Herb Hamlett and O'Jay.<ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=Toop|author-link=David Toop|date=1991|title=Rap Attack 2: African Rap To Global Hip Hop|location=[[New York City]]|publisher=Serpent's Tail|isbn=1-85242-243-2}}</ref> In 1963, the O'Jays released "Lonely Drifter", their first national chart hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|'' Billboard'' Hot 100]],<ref name="LarkinSM"/> peaking at number 93. Their debut album, released shortly thereafter was ''Comin' Through''.<ref name="LarkinSM"/>

Throughout the 1960s, they continued to [[record chart|chart]] with minor hits such as "[[Lipstick Traces (On a Cigarette)|Lipstick Traces]]"<ref name="LarkinSM"/> (which they performed nationally on the ABC television program ''[[Shivaree (TV series)|Shivaree]]''), "Stand In for Love",<ref name="LarkinSM"/> "Stand Tall", "Let It All Out", "I'll Be Sweeter Tomorrow",<ref name="LarkinSM"/> "Look Over Your Shoulder", "Deeper in Love with You", and "[[One Night Affair]]". However, while they issued dozens of singles throughout the decade, they never hit the US top 40 (although "Lipstick Traces" made it to number 19 in Canada). On the R&B chart, the O'Jays were somewhat more prominent, but their only top 10 R&B single prior to 1972 was 1968's "I'll Be Sweeter Tomorrow".<ref name="LarkinSM"/>

In spite of their success as a touring group and on the R&B chart, the group had been considering quitting the [[music industry]] in 1972. Around that time, original members Bill Isles and Bobby Massey departed, leaving the group a trio.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> The remaining three original members, Eddie Levert, William Powell, and Walter Williams continued recording together, and [[Gamble & Huff]], a team of producers and songwriters with whom the O'Jays had been working for several years, signed them to their [[Philadelphia International]] label.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Suddenly, the O'Jays released their first million-seller, "[[Back Stabbers (O'Jays song)|Back Stabbers]]",<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

During the remainder of the 1970s, the O'Jays continued releasing hit singles, including "Put Your Hands Together" (Pop number 10), "[[For the Love of Money]]" (Pop number 9), "[[Give the People What They Want (The O'Jays song)|Give the People What They Want]]", "Let Me Make Love to You", "[[I Love Music (disco)|I Love Music]]" (Pop number 5), "[[Livin' for the Weekend (The O'Jays song)|Livin' for the Weekend]]", "[[Message in Our Music]]", and "[[Darlin' Darlin' Baby (Sweet Tender Love)]]".<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Original member William Powell died of [[cancer]] in 1977 at age 35.<ref name="LarkinSM"/>

After adding [[Sammy Strain]] (of [[Little Anthony and the Imperials]]), the O'Jays continued recording, though with limited success.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> In 1978, the group released "[[Use ta Be My Girl]]", which was their final top-five hit, though they continued placing songs on the R&B charts throughout the 1980s.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> The O'Jays' success was not confined to the United States, as they also logged up nine hit singles in the [[United Kingdom]] between 1972 and 1983, including four tracks that reached the top 20 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

In 1992, Sammy Strain left the group and returned to the Imperials. Strain's departure was filled by Nathaniel Best (born December 13, 1960), who was later replaced by Eric Grant. Later in the 1990s, the group did little recording, though they remained a popular live draw. Their latest album was ''Imagination'', released in 2004.

In 2003, the trio co-starred in the film ''[[The Fighting Temptations]]'', which starred [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]] and [[Beyoncé Knowles]]. In the film, they played three barbers with incredible vocal harmony who joined the local church choir to help out the film's protagonists: Darrin (Gooding) and Lilly (Knowles), who were the choir director and lead singer, respectively.

In 2005, the O'Jays were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Original members Eddie Levert, Walter Williams, Bobby Massey and, posthumously, William Powell, were inducted. In a note of controversy, Sammy Strain was also inducted with the group, while original member Bill Isles was not. (Strain is one of the few artists in popular music history who is a double RRHOF inductee: with the O'Jays in 2005, and [[Little Anthony and the Imperials]] in 2009). In 2006, the O'Jays performed at the [[ESPY]] awards, hosted by [[Lance Armstrong]]. "For the Love of Money" was the theme song to the hit reality TV show ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV Series)|The Apprentice]],'' starring [[Donald Trump]], and the group once performed the song live on the show.

On February 23, 2007, Radio-Canada's website reported that Canadian Industry Minister [[Jim Prentice]] had used the song "For the Love of Money" without the group's permission during a political event, a faux pas since Prentice is responsible for the application of the Copyright Act in Canada. Radio-Canada also reported that Prentice has since been contacted by the attorneys for both the O'Jays and [[Warner/Chappell Music]].

On June 28, 2009, at the 2009 [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] Award Show in the [[Shrine Auditorium]], the O'Jays were honored with BET's 2009 Life Time Achievement Award. [[Tevin Campbell]], [[Trey Songz]], [[Tyrese Gibson]] and [[Johnny Gill]] performed a medley of the group's songs, followed by the presentation of the award by [[Don Cornelius]]. The group reminisced, joked with the audience, and accepted their award before performing renditions of their hit songs.

On October 30, 2010, the group performed at [[Jon Stewart]] and [[Stephen Colbert]]'s [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] In Cleveland, Ohio, on August 17, 2013, the O'Jays were inducted into The National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame. The O'Jays are also two-time [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] Inductees for their songs "[[Love Train]]" (inducted 2006) and "[[For the Love of Money]]" (inducted 2016).<ref>[https://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/hall-of-fame#l]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626200735/https://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/hall-of-fame |date=2015-06-26 }}</ref>
