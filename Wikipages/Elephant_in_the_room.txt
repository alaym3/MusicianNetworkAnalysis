It is based on the idea/thought that something as conspicuous as an [[elephant]] can appear to be overlooked in codified social interactions and that the sociology/psychology of [[Repression (psychology)|repression]] also operates on the macro scale.

==Origins==
In 1814, [[Ivan Krylov]] (1769{{ndash}}1844), poet and fabulist, wrote a fable entitled "The Inquisitive Man", which tells of a man who goes to a museum and notices all sorts of tiny things, but fails to notice an elephant. The phrase became proverbial.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Dostoyevsky|first=Fyodor|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/31657709|title=Demons : a novel in three parts|last2=Достоевский, Федор, 1821-1881.|date=1994|publisher=Vintage|others=trans.

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' gives the first recorded use of the phrase, as a [[simile]], in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on June 20, 1959: "Financing schools has become a problem about equal to having an elephant in the living room. It's so big you just can't ignore it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50073129?| title=OED, Draft Additions June 2006: elephant, n.| publisher=OUP| access-date=2008-11-11}}</ref> According to the website the Phrase Finder, the first known use in print is from 1952.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Martin|first=Gary|title='The elephant in the room' - the meaning and origin of this phrase|url=https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/elephant-in-the-room.html|access-date=2020-09-22|website=Phrasefinder|language=en}}</ref>

This idiomatic expression may have been in general use much earlier than 1959. For example, the phrase appears 44 years earlier in the pages of the British ''Journal of Education'' in 1915. The sentence was presented as a trivial illustration of a question British schoolboys would be able to answer, e.g., "Is there an elephant in the class-room?"<ref>''Journal of education,'' Vol. 37 (1915), p. 288.</ref>

The first widely disseminated conceptual reference was a story written by [[Mark Twain]] in 1882, "[[The Stolen White Elephant]]", which recounts the inept, far-ranging activities of detectives trying to find an elephant that was right on the spot after all. This story, combined with Dostoyevsky's [[Ironic process theory|white bear]], may have been on [[Jerome Frank]]'s mind when he wrote in his dissent in ''United States v. Antonelli Fireworks'' (1946)<ref name="Antonelli">{{cite web |title=United States v. Antonelli Fireworks Co., 155 F.2d 631 (2d Cir. 1946) |date=1946-05-02 |website=Justia |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/155/631/1563658/}}</ref> and again in dissent in ''United States v. Leviton'' (1951)<ref>{{cite web |title=United States v. Leviton et al, 193 F.2d 848 (2d Cir. 1951) |date=1951-11-30 |website=Justia |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/193/848/349489/}}</ref> of "the Mark Twain story of the little boy who was told to stand in a corner and not to think of a white elephant."

The phrase may also be a response to philosopher Alfred North Whitehead's 1929 description<ref>Process and Reality, p. 6</ref> of the validity of immediate experience: "Sometimes we see an elephant, and sometimes we do not. The result is that an elephant, when present, is noticed."

In 1935, comedian [[Jimmy Durante]] starred on Broadway in the [[Billy Rose]] Broadway musical ''[[Jumbo (musical)|Jumbo]]'', in which a police officer stops him as he leads a live elephant and asks, "What are you doing with that elephant?"  Durante's reply, "What elephant?" was a regular show-stopper. Durante reprises the piece in the 1962 film version of the play, ''[[Billy Rose's Jumbo]]''.

==Usage==
The term refers to a question, problem, solution, or controversial issue which is obvious to everyone who knows about the situation, but which is deliberately ignored because to do otherwise would cause great embarrassment, sadness, or arguments, or is simply taboo. The idiom can imply a [[value judgment]] that the issue ought to be discussed openly, or it can simply be an acknowledgment that the issue is there and not going to go away by itself.

The term is often used to describe an issue that involves a social [[taboo]] or which generates disagreement, such as race, religion, politics, homosexuality, mental illness, or suicide.  It is applicable when a subject is emotionally charged; and the people who might have spoken up decide that it is probably best avoided.<ref>Palta, Namrata. (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?id=yhfCj3QVIFUC&pg=PA95&dq=  ''Spoken English: a Detailed and Simplified Course for Learning Spoken English,'' p. 95.]</ref>

The idiom is commonly used in addiction recovery terminology to describe the reluctance of friends and family of an addicted person to discuss the person's problem, thus aiding the person's denial. Especially in reference to alcohol abuse, the idiom is sometimes coupled with that of the [[Seeing pink elephants|pink elephant]], "the pink elephant in the room."{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The expression has also been used as a metaphorical idiom in Spanish.  In 1994, the [[8000 Process]] was a legal investigation of a Colombian presidential campaign.  There were accusations that the campaign of Colombian Liberal Party candidate [[Ernesto Samper]] was partially funded with drug money from the [[Cali Cartel]].  Insisting on his innocence, Samper stated that if drug money had entered the presidential campaign, it had done so "behind his back".  [[Pedro Rubiano Sáenz|Cardinal Pedro Rubiano]], a leader of Colombia's [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]], stated in an interview that not knowing that drug money financed part of the presidential campaign was similar to not noticing "an elephant entering one's living room".<ref>[http://www.canalrcn.com/noticias/index.php?op=info&idC=28266&idP=119&idS=742 Canal RCN - Noticias RCN<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928004609/http://www.canalrcn.com/noticias/index.php?op=info&idC=28266&idP=119&idS=742 |date=2007-09-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.semana.com/wf_InfoArticulo.aspx?IdArt=30217|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120910055609/http://www.semana.com/wf_InfoArticulo.aspx?IdArt=30217|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-09-10|title=Articulo Archivado FRASES DEL AÑO<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref>  Since then, the events that led to drug money financing the "Samper for President" campaign have been referred to as "The Elephant."

The title of [[Alan Clarke]]'s 1989 television film ''[[Elephant (1989 film)|Elephant]]'' references the term.  This was in turn influential in the naming of [[Gus Van Sant]]'s [[Elephant (2003 film)|2003 film of the same name]], although Van Sant thought [[blind men and an elephant|a different expression]] was being referenced. [[Alexandra Burke]]'s 2012 single [[Elephant (Alexandra Burke song)|Elephant]] also uses the concept.
