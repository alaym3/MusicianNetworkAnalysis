Wage War started in 2010 under the name "Empires" in [[Ocala, Florida]].<ref name="Bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/wage-war-mn0003408259/biography|title=Biography : Wage War|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|first=Neil Z.|last=Yeung|access-date=July 14, 2016}}</ref> The band originally consisted of Briton Bond ([[Death growl|unclean vocals]]), Cody Quistad (rhythm guitar/clean vocals), Seth Blake (lead guitar), Jordan Pierce (bass) and David Rau (drums).
