'''Slint''' was an American [[Rock music|rock]] band consisting of [[Brian McMahan]] (guitar and vocals), [[David Pajo]] (guitar), [[Britt Walford]] (drums and vocals), Todd Brashear (bass on ''Spiderland''), and [[Ethan Buckler]] (bass on ''Tweez''). They formed in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]], United States, in 1986. Slint's first album ''[[Tweez]]'' was recorded by engineer [[Steve Albini]] in 1987 and released in obscurity on the Jennifer Hartman Records label in 1989. It was followed two years later by the critically acclaimed ''[[Spiderland]]'', released on the independent label [[Touch and Go Records]].

They have reunited sporadically since 1990.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.clashmusic.com/news/slint-to-reform | title=Slint To Reform! | publisher=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]] | date=July 23, 2013 | access-date=July 23, 2013 | author=Murray, Robin}}</ref>

==History==
===Pre-Slint===
Walford and McMahan met in their pre-teens and attended [[the Brown School]], a [[Jefferson County Public Schools (Kentucky)|Louisville public school]] founded on a pedagogy of self-directed learning.<ref name="Brown School">{{cite web|title=About - J. Graham Brown School|url=http://www.mybrownschool.org/about|website=www.mybrownschool.org|access-date=7 January 2017}}</ref> They began performing music together at an early age, forming the Languid and Flaccid with Ned Oldham (later of The Anomoanon) while still in middle school.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.viceland.com/int/v10n5/htdocs/something.php |title=SOMETHING LIKE AN ANOMOANON&nbsp;– Is Something Like Will Oldham&nbsp;– Vice Magazine |publisher=Viceland.com |access-date=2010-11-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019022004/http://www.vice.com/read/something-v10n5 |archive-date=2012-10-19 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/features/060310-davidgrubbs.shtml |title=PopMatters Music Feature &#124; Louisville Born, Brooklyn Based |publisher=Popmatters.com |access-date=2010-11-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://louisvillepunk.awardspace.com/Photos/LanguidFlaccid00.html |title=back |publisher=Louisvillepunk.awardspace.com |access-date=2010-11-20 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AjhMbMnk?url=http://louisvillepunk.awardspace.com/Photos/LanguidFlaccid00.html |archive-date=2012-09-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In their teens Walford and McMahan played together in the seminal Louisville punk band [[Squirrel Bait]]. Walford left the band following their first recording session while McMahan went on to tour and record Squirrel Bait's two albums before the band's dissolution in 1987.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.louisvillehardcore.com/index.php?title=Maurice |title=Maurice&nbsp;– Louisville Punk/Hardcore History |publisher=History.louisvillehardcore.com |date=2010-02-27 |access-date=2010-11-20}}</ref>

Pajo and Walford (and, briefly, McMahan) were in the punk/prog-metal band Maurice with future members of Kinghorse. After being influenced by the music of the [[Minutemen (band)|Minutemen]], Pajo and Walford's musical direction became too obtuse for the other members of Maurice, who parted ways. Maurice's later material would form the basis of some of Slint's early compositions.<ref name="Bangs, 2014" />

=== 1986: Founding ===
Slint formed in the summer of 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/release/439361-Tweez/images|title=Images for Slint - Tweez|website=www.discogs.com|access-date=16 April 2018}}</ref> Walford and Pajo were joined by the slightly older Buckler (age 18 at the time) for a show for a [[Unitarian Universalist]] congregation on November 2; performing under the name Small Tight Dirty Tufts of Hair, most of the congregation left during the band's first two songs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mog.com/jsguntzel/blog/21046 |title=Invisible Histories: Slint (Part 2) |publisher=Mog.com |access-date=2010-11-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922125200/http://mog.com/jsguntzel/blog/21046 |archive-date=2012-09-22 }}</ref> They were soon joined by McMahan and named themselves Slint after one of Walford's pet fish.<ref name="Bangs, 2014" />

=== 1987–1989: ''Tweez,'' singles, and Ethan Buckler's departure ===
Slint's first album ''[[Tweez]]'' was recorded in the fall of 1987 by [[Steve Albini]], whom the band had chosen because they were fans of Albini's recently defunct group [[Big Black]]. Though Slint's members had composed the album's music during rehearsals in Walford's parents' basement, most of the lyrics were created in-studio, and included between-song sound effects and [[ad-lib]]bed conversations with Albini.<ref name="Bangs, 2014">{{cite AV media|last1=Bangs|first1=Lance|title=Breadcrumb Trail|date=2014|publisher=Touch and Go|location=Chicago}}</ref> During mixdown, Walford requested that Albini "make the bass drum sound like a ham being slapped by a catcher's mitt," and then spilled a cup of [[tea]] on Albini's mixing board.<ref name="Simpson, 2014">{{cite news|last1=Simpson|first1=Dave|title=Spiderland by Slint: the album that reinvented rock|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/01/spiderland-slint-album-reinvented-rock|work=The Guardian|date=1 May 2014}}</ref> Without formal song titles, eight of the album's tracks were named for the band members' parents, and a ninth for Walford's dog, Rhoda. Once completed, Buckler was dissatisfied with the recordings and left Slint to form the group [[King Kong (American band)|King Kong]], initially made up of all of Slint's members taking up different instruments. All of Slint's original members recorded the single "Movie Star" as King Kong in Steve Albini's studio while he was away on a trip in 1989.<ref name="Me Hungry">{{cite web|title=King Kong - "Me Hungry"|url=http://www.dragcity.com/products/me-hungry|website=www.dragcity.com|publisher=Drag City|access-date=7 January 2017}}</ref>

Buckler was soon replaced by bass player Todd Brashear. Slint had hoped that Touch and Go Records would release ''Tweez'', but the band did not hear back from the label.<ref name="Bangs, 2014" /> A friend of the group, Jennifer Hartman, paid for the album's release for a tiny run on the imprint Jennifer Hartman Records in 1989.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book

Original copies of ''Tweez'' included a flyer advertising a 12" single of these songs to be released on Jennifer Hartman. But by now the band had succeeded in catching the ear of [[Touch & Go Records]]'s founder [[Corey Rusk]] who agreed to release the group's next album. The master tapes to the proposed 12" were then shelved, making ''Tweez'' the sole release on the Jennifer Hartman label.<ref name="Bangs, 2014" />

=== 1988–1991: ''Spiderland'', Todd Brashear joins, and dissolution ===
By the time ''Tweez'' was released, most of the group had gone off to college and would return to Louisville during breaks to write and practice new material. Returning to the Walfords' basement, the group would spend hours repeating the same guitar riff and then adding in layers of nuance on top of it.<ref name="Simpson, 2014" /> After rehearsals, McMahan took practice tapes home and worked on vocals with the use of a 4-track tape recorder. Sitting in his parents' car made it possible to record softly spoken vocals over the band's loud music.<ref name="Bangs, 2014" /> After developing these new songs, Slint's members wanted a cleaner sound than that of their first LP, and approached Minneapolis producer Brian Paulson who had recorded two albums with McMahan's former bandmates' group [[Bastro]].<ref name="Bangs, 2014" /> On a trip to visit Bastro and Paulson during the recording sessions for their final studio album, ''Sing the Troubled Beast'', McMahan was in a near-fatal car accident. While in the ambulance, a paramedic called in "Code 138" and the immobilized McMahan regained consciousness singing the [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]] song "We are 138."<ref name="Bangs, 2014" /> McMahan's brush with death left the young musician feeling [[Depression (mood)|depressed]], a condition that would affect the recording and aftermath of Slint's next album.<ref name="Simpson, 2014" />

Paulson and Slint met over a weekend to record ''[[Spiderland]]'' in Chicago. All of the music was recorded live, with vocals overdubbed afterward in no more than two takes and with little to no rehearsal on the part of McMahan.<ref name="Simpson, 2014" /> The group used two different microphones to record vocals: one for softer, spoken voices, and one for louder, sung voices. During mixdown, Paulson and the group would try adding different effects, but all these were rejected, resulting in a very pared-down production sound.<ref name="Bangs, 2014" /> The day after ''Spiderland'''s recording session ended, McMahan checked himself into a mental hospital where he was diagnosed with depression, and subsequently left the band.<ref name="Simpson, 2014" />

Longtime friend of the band [[Will Oldham]] took numerous photos of the group as potential album covers. Some of these were taken in a nearby [[quarry]] and one was chosen with Slint's four members' heads bobbing above the surface of the water.<ref name="D, Minds, 2014">{{cite web|title=Slint and Will Oldham discuss that famous 'Spiderland' album cover|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/slint_and_will_oldham|website=DangerousMinds|access-date=7 January 2017|date=18 December 2014}}</ref> Touch and Go released ''Spiderland'' in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/5923-top-100-albums-of-the-1990s/9/ |title=Staff Lists: Top 100 Albums of the 1990s |publisher=Pitchfork |date=2003-11-17 |access-date=2010-11-20}}</ref>

  }}</ref> The album was unlike anything else that the label had released to date. Slint was to have gone on a European tour after its release, but with the band no longer together, there were no tours, interviews, photo or video shoots to promote the album.<ref name="Bangs, 2014" /> Despite this, the album's repute grew and it continued to sell several thousand copies annually in the years following its release, a considerable feat for an indie record by a defunct group and a mystique around the record, and the artists who made it, began to grow.<ref name="Bangs, 2014" />

''Spiderland'' is considered a seminal work,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Riggs |first1=Richard |url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4136138 |title=Slowcore Week: Slint and Codeine&nbsp;– a shared musical language? / In Depth // Drowned In Sound |publisher=Drownedinsound.com |date=2009-02-17 |access-date=2010-11-20 |archive-date=2012-09-17 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AjhSUcGo?url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4136138 |url-status=dead }}</ref> characterized by dark, [[Syncopation|syncopated]] rhythms, sparse guitar lines and haunting subject matter. The record's impact was such that many fans and critics consider it a foundational post-rock album,<ref name="D, Minds, 2014" /> helping to usher in a new wave of bands seeking a move away from the unfettered aggression of [[hardcore punk]] but not its underlying ethic.

===1992–present: Post-Slint===
The band briefly reformed in 1992, and again in 1994. During this time, Touch and Go Records reissued ''[[Tweez]]'' in 1993, and in 1994 an [[untitled Slint EP|untitled 10"]] [[Extended play|EP]] of the two songs from the shelved tapes recorded between their two albums—one a reinterpretation of "Rhoda" from ''Tweez'', and the other a track called "Glenn".

Members of Slint have since appeared in a number of bands.  In 2009, former guitarist [[David Pajo]] performed with [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]] as a live back-up musician.  He briefly played in [[Stereolab]], took up bass in [[Interpol (band)|Interpol]], and performs under the moniker [[David Pajo|PAJO]] and occasionally with his band [[Papa M]], also known as Ariel M, or just M.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/06/arts/music/06all.html?scp=3&sq=Jarmusch&st=cse | work=The New York Times | first1=Ben | last1=Ratliff | title=Iggy and the Stooges at All Tomorrow's Parties | date=2010-09-05}}</ref>  Pajo has also been a member of [[Dead Child]], [[Tortoise (band)|Tortoise]], [[Will Oldham|Palace]], [[The For Carnation]], [[Household Gods (band)|Household Gods]] and the short-lived [[Billy Corgan]]-fronted rock band [[Zwan]]. Guitarist Brian McMahan formed [[The For Carnation]] in 1994 and also played with [[Will Oldham]] in Palace. Britt Walford played drums in Evergreen, and for [[The Breeders]] under the pseudonym Shannon Doughton on the album ''[[Pod (The Breeders album)|Pod]]'', and as Mike Hunt on the ''[[Safari (Breeders EP)|Safari]]'' EP.  [[Ethan Buckler]] has released several albums with his group [[King Kong (American band)|King Kong]] featuring an ever-shifting cast of members who have occasionally included David Pajo.

====Reunions====
Nearly fifteen years after originally disbanding, three members of Slint—Brian McMahan, [[David Pajo]], and Britt Walford—reunited to curate the 2005 [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] (ATP) music festival in [[Camber Sands]], England. Also in 2005, Slint played a number of shows in the U.S. and in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.descendo.com/slint/ |title=Slint reunion 2005 |publisher=Descendo.com |access-date=2014-03-29}}</ref>  Though they insisted the reunion was short-term, the band regrouped once again in 2007 to perform ''Spiderland'' in its entirety in Barcelona as part of the [[Primavera Sound Festival]], in London as part of the ATP ''Don't Look Back'' series of shows, as well as at a handful of dates in Europe, the U.S. (at Chicago's Pitchfork Music Festival, the Showbox in Seattle, and the Henry Fonda Theatre in Hollywood), and Canada.  In addition to performing the album and the EP [[Slint (EP)|Slint]], they also debuted a new composition called "King's Approach",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.touchandgorecords.com/news/detail.php?id=238 |title=News &#124; Touch and Go / Quarterstick Records |publisher=Touchandgorecords.com |access-date=2014-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=zlayed|title=Slint - King's approach|date=2011-05-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCM5cvDAU6M|access-date=2018-10-27}}</ref> which remains unrecorded.

In a September 2012 interview conducted with Northern Irish music publication [[AU Magazine]], [[David Pajo]] hinted at more activity from the band in the coming months: "We still communicate regularly and we've got some surprises for next year that fans will be excited about. I know I am."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iheartau.com/2012/09/david-pajo/ |title=David Pajo |publisher=iheartau.com |access-date=2012-09-24}}</ref>

The band reunited in December 2013 to play as one of the headliners of the final [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] holiday camp festival in Camber Sands, England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpfestival.com/events/endofanerapart2.php |title=End Of An Era Part 2 curated by ATP & Loop - All Tomorrow's Parties |publisher=Atpfestival.com |access-date=2014-03-29}}</ref>

In an August 2013 interview with Vish Khanna, former producer [[Steve Albini]] revealed that the band was working on remastering their second album ''Spiderland'' with producer [[Bob Weston]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vishkhanna.com/2013/08/16/ep-24-steve-albini/ |title=Ep. #24: Steve Albini &#124; Kreative Kontrol |publisher=Vishkhanna.com |date=2013-08-16 |access-date=2014-03-29}}</ref>  The deluxe ''Spiderland'' boxset was announced in January 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/53769-slints-spiderland-gets-deluxe-box-set-reissue/ |title=Slint's Spiderland Gets Deluxe Box Set Reissue |publisher=Pitchfork |date=2014-01-30 |access-date=2014-03-29}}</ref> In 2014 Touch and Go released several live, demo, and practice sessions of songs recorded by the band between 1989 and 1990.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Slint-Spiderland/release/5584658|title=Slint - Spiderland|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2017-07-21}}</ref> These appeared as the LP ''Bonus Tracks'', as well as in box set editions of ''Spiderland'' alongside the DVD ''[[Breadcrumb Trail (film)|Breadcrumb Trail]]'', filmmaker [[Lance Bangs]]' 90-minute documentary about the band shot over the course of 12 years.<ref name="Nixon, 2014">{{cite web|last1=Nixon|first1=Dan|title=Some Fucking Stars: Slint Documentary Breadcrumb Trail Reviewed|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/14798-slint-breadcrumb-trail-review|website=The Quietus|access-date=7 January 2017|date=March 24, 2014}}</ref> In 2014, the band also performed at the [[Primavera Sound]] music festival in Spain and Portugal and [[Green Man Festival]] in Wales.

The group has no plans to record new material and have since disbanded after their most recent reunions in 2013 and 2014.

== Musical style ==
The band was noted for having syncopated guitar riffs, drastically altering dynamics, and complex song structures and time signatures.<ref name="Simpson">{{Cite news|last=Simpson|first=Dave|date=2014-05-01|title=Spiderland by Slint: the album that reinvented rock|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/01/spiderland-slint-album-reinvented-rock|access-date=2020-05-29|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> McMahan's and Walford's vocals comprised hushed spoken words, singing, and strained screaming.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Slint: Spiderland|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19182-slint-spiderland-remastered-box-set/|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=2020-05-29}}</ref>
