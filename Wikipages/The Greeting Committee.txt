'''The Greeting Committee''' is an American indie rock band from [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Missouri]] that is currently signed to [[Harvest Records]]. The band initially received attention after its single, "Hands Down", received airplay on Kansas City's [[KRBZ]] radio station in 2015. Two EPs preceded the release of the group's debut studio album, ''This Is It'', released in October 2018.

==History==

The Greeting Committee was formed by Addie Sartino (lead vocals), Brandon Yangmi (guitar), Pierce Turcotte (bass), and Austin Fraser (drums) while the four were attending [[Blue Valley High School]] in [[Overland Park, Kansas]] in the summer of 2014. The group's first gig was at a school talent show that year. In March 2015, The Greeting Committee self-released its first EP, ''It's Not All That Bad''. A copy of the collection was given to Lazlo Geiger, an on-air personality at Kansas City's KRBZ radio station. Geiger began playing the band's track, "Hands Down", on air.<ref name="KC">{{cite news | last=Finn| first=Timothy| title =KC band the Greeting Committee gets a swift, warm ‘hello’ from music world | newspaper =The Kansas City Star| date =20 March 2016 | url =https://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/ent-columns-blogs/back-to-rockville/article67257402.html| access-date = 23 August 2019}}</ref> The song has gone on to accrue over 10 million streams on various platforms since then.<ref name="Bsides">{{cite news | title =VIDEO: INTERVIEW – The Greeting Committee Talk Recording and Live Interpretation of Debut Album| work =B-Sides| date =24 June 2019 | url =http://b-sides.tv/interviews/20190624-video-interview-the-greeting-committee-talk-recording-and-live-interpretation-of-debut-album| access-date = 23 August 2019}}</ref>
