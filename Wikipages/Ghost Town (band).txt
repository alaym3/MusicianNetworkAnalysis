'''Ghost Town''' is an American [[electronic rock|electronic]] band from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], United States. The band formed on September 4, [[2012 in music|2012]], and in [[2013 in music|2013]] were signed to [[Fueled by Ramen]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ghost Town|url=http://www.fueledbyramen.com/artist/Ghost%20Town|website=fueledbyramen.com|publisher=Fueled by Ramen|accessdate=July 24, 2014}}</ref><ref name=":0" />

The band is made up of [[vocalist]] Kevin "Ghost" McCullough and [[keyboardist]] Evan Pearce, who left the band for a short period of time beginning in 2015, just a few weeks before the release of ''[[Evolution (Ghost Town album)|Evolution]]''. He returned late 2016. From the group's foundation in 2012 until 2017 the band also included [[drummer]] MannYtheDrummer and [[guitarist]]/[[backing vocalist]] Alix Koochaki. 

Alister Dippner creates artwork for the band's releases and is closely associated with them. Ghost Town Tuesday, or GTT, is an event that lasts over the course of a few weeks each round, and the band releases songs every Tuesday.<ref name=":0">{{cite magazine|author=Martins, Chris|date=10 April 2013|url=https://www.spin.com/2013/04/lets-get-slimed-how-ghost-town-social-mediad-their-way-to-overnight-success/|title=Let's Get Slimed: How Ghost Town Social Media'd Their Way to Overnight Success|magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|accessdate=July 25, 2014}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{cite web|author=Thompson-Smith, Oliver|date=26 November 2013|url=http://www.phasemagazine.co.uk/introducing-ghost-town/|title=Introducing: Ghost Town|publisher=Phase Magazine|accessdate=September 10, 2014}}</ref> The band has released three albums, ''[[Party in the Graveyard]]'', ''[[The After Party (album)|The After Party]]'', and ''[[Evolution (Ghost Town album)|Evolution]]'', as well as two acoustic EPs, ''Bare Bones'' and ''Tiny Pieces''.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=17 June 2014|url=http://substreammagazine.com/2014/06/review-ghost-town-the-after-party/|title=Review: Ghost Town – 'The After Party|magazine=[[Substream Magazine]]|accessdate=August 15, 2014}}</ref> ''The After Party'' charted at No. 135 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and reached No. 1 on [[Top Heatseekers|''Billboard'' Top Heatseekers]] chart.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ghost Town awards|accessdate=August 15, 2014|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ghost-town-mn0001649569/awards|website=allmusic.com}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation and ''[[Party in the Graveyard]]'' (2012–2013)===
Kevin McCullough, Alix Koochaki, and Alister Dippner all attended high school together in [[Palm Springs, California]]. Kevin moved to Hollywood, CA and started Ghost Town with Zachary LeCompte-Goble. They added producer Evan Pearce and drummer Manny Dominick after a few months. After high school, Alister moved to [[San Luis Obispo]] to follow his passion for painting. Still being friends, Kevin sent him rough cuts of Ghost Town's first songs. Alister listened to them and replied, "This is like my art as music. I want nothing more than to be a part of whatever you guys make."<ref name="Spin">{{cite web|title = Let's Get Slimed: How Ghost Town Social Media'd Their Way to Overnight Success|url = https://www.spin.com/2013/04/lets-get-slimed-how-ghost-town-social-mediad-their-way-to-overnight-success/|website = Spin.com|accessdate = 27 October 2014}}</ref>

On September 4, 2012, Alister Dippner uploaded a sped-up video of himself painting the artwork to "Game Freak" with the song playing in the background, and it went viral. They set up a [[PureVolume]] page shortly after and rose to the top of the site's charts.<ref name="Spin" />

After the release of "Game Freak", the band decided to write, produce, and release a new song every week, dubbing them "Ghost Town Tuesdays". They released 12 songs over the course of 9 weeks.<ref name=":1" />

Using many of the songs released over the course of four months, along with five new songs, the band self-released their first album, ''[[Party in the Graveyard]]''. The band uploaded a version of the album onto YouTube on December 21, 2012.<ref name=":0" /> The full album was available on iTunes on January 15, 2013.<ref name="Purevolume announcement">{{cite web|author=PureVolume|date=15 January 2013|accessdate=23 October 2015|title=Ghost Town Release Debut Full-Length Party in the Graveyard|url=http://www.purevolume.com/news/ghost-town-debut-full-length-party-in-the-graveyard}}</ref>

===Departure of Evan and ''Evolution'' (2015–2016)===
In July 2015, Evan Pearce announced his departure from Ghost Town due to undisclosed health reasons. In the press release, the band announced they would continue as a [[trio (music)|trio]].<ref name="Evan leaves">{{cite magazine|author=Leak, Brian|date=15 July 2015|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/evan_pearce_leaves_ghost_town_due_to_health_reasons|title=Evan Pearce leaves Ghost Town due to health reasons|magazine=[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]|accessdate=22 October 2015}}</ref> Evan Pearce is now back with Ghost Town as of 2017.

The album was recorded at Pulse Studios in Spring of 2015 with [[Josh Abraham]], Nico Stadi, Oligee, and Ryan Williams over a span of 6 weeks.<ref name="Kerrang">{{cite magazine|author=Carter, Emily|date=10 September 2015|url=http://www.kerrang.com/35444/ghost-town-announce-new-album-evolution/|title=Ghost Town Announce New Album, Evolution|magazine=[[Kerrang!]]|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref>

The album, according to Kevin Ghost, has a different message than the band's previous works.

{{quote|text="In the past we've written a lot of songs about very specific relationships or very specific situations that people go through. This is a broader spectrum. The message has to do with people opening their eyes and not being so tunnel-visioned. Don't do the first thing someone tells you to do just because it seems like the easiest thing to do. It's not about what you wear, or how many people follow you, or how you look. It's about creating a community of like-minded people and accepting everyone.|author=Kevin Ghost<ref name="Kerrang" />}}

The second single off of the album, "Mean Kids", focuses on the subject of bullying.<ref name="Mean Kids">{{cite web|title=Ghost Town Dissect Bullying On New Track "Mean Kids": Idolator Premiere|url=http://www.idolator.com/7611542/ghost-town-mean-kids-premiere|accessdate=16 October 2015}}</ref> On October 22, 2015, "Loner" was available for preview in an article on Billboard.
