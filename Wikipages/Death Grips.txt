Death Grips were scheduled to perform at [[Lollapalooza]] in August, but their performance was cancelled after the group failed to show up for an after-party show the previous night at the [[Bottom Lounge]], instead putting on a playlist of pre-recorded tracks. Draped over the back of the stage was a huge printout of a fan's suicide note, written to the group in the form of an email. Fans at the show destroyed and stole pieces of the band's equipment after being informed of the cancellation.<ref name="lollapalooza">{{cite news | title = Death Grips Fans Turn Violent After Band Skips Lollapalooza After Party Appearance | date = August 3, 2013 | publisher = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | url = https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/5638123/death-grips-fans-turn-violent-after-band-skips-lollapalooza | access-date = August 3, 2013 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130805235628/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/5638123/death-grips-fans-turn-violent-after-band-skips-lollapalooza | archive-date = August 5, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Death Grips Lollapalooza Set Cancelled, Band Replaced After No-Show To Official Afterparty | date = August 3, 2013 | work = The Huffington Post | url = https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/03/death-grips-cancelled-lol_n_3701104.html | access-date = August 3, 2013 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130824095237/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/03/death-grips-cancelled-lol_n_3701104.html | archive-date = August 24, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first = Marcus | last = Gilmer | title = Death Grips bail on Lollapalooza after-show, fans destroy band's equipment | date = August 3, 2013 | publisher = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | url = http://voices.suntimes.com/arts-entertainment/the-daily-sizzle/band-bails-on-lollapalooza-after-show-fans-destroy-bands-equipment/ | access-date = August 3, 2013 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130807090119/http://voices.suntimes.com/arts-entertainment/the-daily-sizzle/band-bails-on-lollapalooza-after-show-fans-destroy-bands-equipment/ | archive-date = August 7, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first = Miriam | last = Coleman | title = Fans Trash Death Grips' Equipment After Lollapalooza No-Show | date = August 3, 2013 | publisher = Rolling Stone | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/fans-trash-death-grips-equipment-after-lollapalooza-no-show-20130803 | access-date = August 3, 2013 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130805090105/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/fans-trash-death-grips-equipment-after-lollapalooza-no-show-20130803 | archive-date = August 5, 2013 }}</ref> Their subsequent performance scheduled for Montreal's [[Osheaga Festival|Osheaga Music and Arts Festival]] on the next day was cancelled, as well as performances in Boston and New York.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/death-grips-29-1249591|title=Death Grips cancel further shows following fans trashing equipment in Chicago – NME|date=2013-08-05|work=NME|access-date=2018-07-13|language=en-US|archive-date=2018-07-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180713165702/https://www.nme.com/news/music/death-grips-29-1249591|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first = Marc-André | last = Mongrain | title = OSHEAGA 2013 – Death Grips annule à son tour | language = fr | publisher = sorstu.ca | date = August 3, 2013 | url = http://www.sorstu.ca/osheaga-2013-death-grips-annule-a-son-tour/ | access-date = August 4, 2013 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130806233731/http://www.sorstu.ca/osheaga-2013-death-grips-annule-a-son-tour/ | archive-date = August 6, 2013 }}</ref> The group however, never planned to actually appear at Lollapalooza; they later stated that the drum kit, suicide note, and pre-recorded music "was the show".

They are also notable for engaging in extended periods of live musical improvisation interwoven into their set as bridges between songs, typically performed on the fly by Morin and Hill. Ride has been known to adopt many different vocal styles on record and during live performances, such as shouting, screaming, spoken word-style talking, and even whispering. Morin's unorthodox style of production and sampling and Hill's noisy, fast, and unconventional drumming styles and patterns are also distinct features of Death Grips' sound. The group is also notable for their distinctive and [[Lo-fi photography|lo-fi visual style]] made clear in their music videos, performances, and releases.
