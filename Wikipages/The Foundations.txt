'''The Foundations''' were a [[British soul]] band (m. 1967–1970). The group's background was [[West Indies|West Indians]], [[White British]], and [[Sri Lanka]]n. Their 1967 debut single "[[Baby Now That I've Found You]]" reached number one in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK]] and Canada, and number eleven in the US, while their 1968 single "[[Build Me Up Buttercup]]" reached number two in the UK and number three on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The group was the first [[multi-racial]] group to have a number one hit in the UK in the 1960s.<ref name="Allmusic Biography">{{cite web|author=Bruce Eder |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-foundations-mn0000067900/biography |title=The Foundations &#124; Biography |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=30 January 2014}}</ref>

The Foundations were one of the few British acts to successfully imitate what became known as the [[Motown]] Sound. The Foundations signed to [[Pye Records|Pye]], at the time one of only four big UK record companies (the others being [[EMI]], which included the [[HMV]], [[Columbia Graphophone Company|Columbia]] and [[Parlophone]] labels, [[Decca Records|Decca]], and [[Philips Records|Philips]], which also owned [[Fontana Records|Fontana]]).<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/>

==Biography==
===Origins===
The Foundations attracted much interest and intrigue due to the size and structure of the group. Not only was there a diverse ethnic mix in the group, but there was also diversity in ages and musical backgrounds. The oldest member of the group, Mike Elliott, was 38 years old. The youngest was [[Tim Harris (drummer)|Tim Harris]], who, at 18, was barely out of school. The West Indian [[horn section]] consisted of [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]]-born [[Mike Elliott (saxophonist)|Mike Elliott]] and Pat Burke, both saxophonists and Dominican-born [[Eric Allandale]] on trombone. They were all highly experienced musicians who came from professional [[jazz]] and [[rock-and-roll]] backgrounds. Mike Elliott had played in various jazz and rock and roll bands including [[Tubby Hayes]] and [[Ronnie Scott]],<ref name="Baby Now That I've Found You CD inlay booklet notes">Inlay notes to ''Baby Now That I've Found You'' CD, Sequel Records NEECD 300</ref> the Cabin Boys (led by [[Tommy Steele]]'s brother, Colin Hicks), and others. Pat Burke, a professional musician, was from the London Music Conservatorium. Eric Allandale had led his own band at one stage as well as having played with [[Edmundo Ros]] and was a former member of the [[Terry Lightfoot]]<ref>[http://www.50connect.co.uk/entertainment/music/artist_focus/a_chat_with_the_foundations_clem_curtis ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018192232/http://www.50connect.co.uk/entertainment/music/artist_focus/a_chat_with_the_foundations_clem_curtis |date=18 October 2008 }}</ref> and Alex Welsh bands. [[Alan Warner (musician)|Alan Warner]] was the guitarist. Bassist Peter Macbeth was a former teacher. Tony Gomez, the keyboard player, was a former clerk, while [[Clem Curtis]] had been an [[interior decorator]] and professional boxer.

There is some disagreement as to who was responsible for choosing the band's name, and various sources give slightly different accounts of their beginnings. One version is that they were originally called [[The Ramong Sound]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pluto-rockband.com/70141/info.php?p=2&pno=0 |title=Biography &#124; Look at the sky, See how to fly; The Original Pluto rock band |publisher=Pluto-rockband.com |access-date=30 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-htPfeAoQmQ |title=Down and out-Pluto |via=YouTube |date=27 January 2009 |access-date=30 January 2014}}</ref> or The Ramongs, and there were two lead singers, Clem Curtis and Raymond Morrison aka Ramong Morrison. When Raymond was imprisoned for six months, a friend of the band suggested future [[Psychedelic rock|Psychedelic]] shock rocker [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musickaleidoscope.blogspot.com/2008_05_29_archive.html |title=Music Kaleidoscope: 5/1/08 – 6/1/08 |publisher=Musickaleidoscope.blogspot.com |access-date=30 January 2014}}</ref>

The Foundations came together in [[Bayswater]], London, in January 1967. They practised and played in a basement club called the Butterfly Club, which they ran.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

They would get to bed around 6 or 7 a.m., sleep until 4 p.m., get up and begin again to get ready to open at 8 p.m. Sometimes they barely made enough money to pay the rent, let alone feed themselves. At times, they lived off the leftovers and a couple of pounds of rice.<ref name="Beat Instrumental">{{cite book

===Career from 1967===
The biography on [[AllMusic]] stated that Barry Class was the first to discover them,<ref name="Allmusic Biography"/> although others claim it was Ron Fairway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alan-warner.com/index.php/5 |title=The Foundations |website=Alan-warner.com |access-date=28 March 2017}}</ref>

When they were at the top spot with "Baby, Now That I've Found You", Fairway commented to ''[[Melody Maker]]'' that most management would pull them out of the "bargain priced dates" that were booked for some time. He expressed gratitude to everyone for their support, and said that they would fulfill every engagement for which they had signed.<ref name="Baby Now That I've Found You CD inlay booklet notes"/>

Not long after "Baby, Now That I've Found You" became a hit, rock historian Roger Dopson describes what followed as a "behind the scenes struggle",<ref name="Baby Now That I've Found You CD inlay booklet notes"/> where Fairway was "pushed out" and his partner, Barry Class, remained as sole manager of the group. Fairway later attempted to sue the band, alleging that he was wrongfully dismissed, though the band said that he had resigned of his own accord.<ref name="NME 02 December 1967">{{cite news
| date= 2 December 1967
| title= Foundations Sued

}}</ref> Dopson also noted that Fairway also leaked a story to the media saying that the Foundations had broken up which only served to keep the Foundations name in the news headlines.<ref name="Baby Now That I've Found You CD inlay booklet notes"/>

The band was playing so loud he could not judge how good they were, but he decided to give them a chance.<ref name="Baby Now That I've Found You CD inlay booklet notes"/> He would later comment in the book, ''1000 UK No. 1 Hits'' by Jon Kutner and Spencer Leigh, that he woke up that morning with a stinking headache, and when he got to the studio and heard the Foundations, he thought they were pretty terrible. He decided his hangover was to blame, and so he gave them the benefit of the doubt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shaynezucker.com/1967a.htm |title=Shaynezucker|publisher=shaynezucker.com |access-date=30 January 2014}}</ref>

At first, they found progress quite slow, and one of their sax players, Pat Burke, had to drop out of the band and take another job while they went through a rough patch. He did rejoin them again later in 1967.<ref name="New Musical Express">{{cite book

When "[[Baby Now That I've Found You]]" was first released it went nowhere. Luckily the [[BBC]]'s newly founded [[BBC Radio 1]] were looking to avoid any records being played by the [[pirate radio]] stations and they looked back at some recent releases that the pirate stations had missed. "Baby, Now That I've Found You" was one of them. The single then took off and by November was [[chart-topper|number]] one in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> This was the ideal time because of the soul boom that was happening in England since 1965 and with American [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] stars visiting the UK, interest and intrigue in the Foundations was generated. Their second single released in January 1968, "[[Back on My Feet Again]]", did not do as well but made it to No. 18 in the UK,<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> and No. 29 in Canada. Also in January 1968 they were invited to put down some tracks for [[John Peel]]'s radio show. One of the tracks that they laid down was a cover of [[? and the Mysterians]] garage classic "[[96 Tears]]".<ref name="Strong Foundations CD inlay booklet notes">{{cite book

The Foundations did tour the United States after their first hit and they toured 32 states with [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], [[Maxine Brown (soul singer)|Maxine Brown]], [[Tim Buckley]], [[Solomon Burke]], [[The Byrds]], [[The Crazy World of Arthur Brown]] and [[The Fifth Dimension]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BwwLBaH9488C&q=%22Mike+Elliott%22Saxophone&pg=PT324 |title=1000 UK Number One Hits |author=Jon Kutner |page=324 |date=26 May 2010 |isbn=9780857123602 |access-date=28 March 2017}}</ref>

Around this time after the release of their second single, tensions developed between the band and their songwriter/producer, Tony Macaulay. He would not allow them to record any of their own songs.<ref name="Allmusic Biography"/> In an interview, the band's organ player, Tony Gomez, told the ''[[NME|New Musical Express]]'' (''NME'') in an interview that he, Peter MacBeth, and Eric Allandale had some ideas that they wanted to put together. Curtis later recalled that Macaulay was a problem. "Tony Macaulay was very talented, but could be difficult to get on with. When we asked to record some of our own material – just as B sides, we weren't after the A side –  he called us 'ungrateful' and stormed out of the studio."<ref name="Baby Now That I've Found You CD inlay booklet notes"/>
The group felt that Macaulay had reined in their "real" sound, making them seem more pop-oriented than they were.<ref name="Allmusic Biography"/> Tony Macaulay was later to recall, "I was never close to the Foundations. I couldn't stand them, and they hated me! But the body of work we recorded was excellent."<ref name="Baby Now That I've Found You CD inlay booklet notes"/>

A third single, also released in 1968 "Any Old Time (You're Lonely and Sad)", reached No. 48.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/>

===Curtis and Elliott leave group===
Original vocalist Curtis left in 1968, because he felt that a couple of the band's members were taking it a bit too easy, thinking that because they had now had a hit, they did not have to put in as much effort as they had previously.<ref name="Allmusic Biography"/> Saxophonist Mike Elliott also left around this time and was never replaced. Curtis hung around and helped them audition a replacement singer. They auditioned 200 singers. It was reported in a ''NME'' article in 1968 that Curtis while being interviewed at a festival had mentioned that they were trying out Warren Davis to replace him. He said he would not leave the band until they found a replacement. He had become friendly with [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] and was encouraged to try his luck in the United States. He moved to the United States for a solo career on the [[nightclub|club]] circuit, encouraged by the likes of [[Wilson Pickett]] and [[Sam & Dave]], playing [[Las Vegas]] with [[The Righteous Brothers]]. His successful replacement was [[Colin Young]].

===New lead singer===
With Young the band had two more big hits; "[[Build Me Up Buttercup]]" which was their third hit in January 1968 and "[[In the Bad Bad Old Days (Before You Loved Me)]]" which was a hit in April 1969,<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> and reached No. 23 in Canada 5 May that year.

At the height of their popularity, the Foundations management were in negotiations with a UK TV company for a television series that would star members of the band. They had turned down a number of offers to appear in films because of script unsuitability.<ref name="Billboard – Google Books">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dCgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA43 |title=Billboard – Google Books |date=26 April 1969 |access-date=30 January 2014}}</ref>

Bassist Peter Macbeth left the band in 1969, to join the group Bubastis with Bernie Living,<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/sunsetstrip/diner/2674/living_bernie_a.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026201920/http://www.geocities.com/sunsetstrip/diner/2674/living_bernie_a.htm |date=26 October 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philbrodieband.com/muso_peter-macbeth.htm |title=A TRIBUTE TO JAMES JAMERSON by Pete Macbeth |publisher=Philbrodieband.com |date=2 February 1943 |access-date=30 January 2014}}</ref> and was replaced by [[Steve Bingham (guitarist)|Steve Bingham]].

===Beginning of 1970 to the breakup in late 1970===
After a successful run of hits, the Foundations broke off with their management and a [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]]-sponsored tour to support [[The Temptations]] at the newly opened Copacabana club. This ended up in disaster and the band came back to the UK in low spirits. It had been previously reported in a publicity sheet around early December 1969 that the band had broken away from their manager Barry Class, during the week of their departure from Barry Class, another bass player Tony Collinge joined the band. Jim Dawson who was formerly their agent and Mike Dolan took over the group's affairs.<ref name="Tony Brainsby Publicity Ltd">{{cite book

}}</ref> The group's final hits were "[[Born to Live, Born to Die]]" which was written by Eric Allandale and Tony Gomez.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/born-to-live-and-born-to-die-mt0012653592 |title=Born to Live and Born to Die - The Foundations &#124; Listen, Appearances, Song Review |publisher=AllMusic |date=11 September 2001 |access-date=30 January 2014}}</ref> and "[[My Little Chickadee (song)|My Little Chickadee]]", a US only hit which barely made the hot 100. Another member joined the band in 1970. Paul Lockey who had been with [[Robert Plant]] in [[Band of Joy]] joined as their bass guitarist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://birminghammusicarchive.co.uk/?page_id=51 |title=Band of Joy &#124; Birmingham Music Archive |publisher=Birminghammusicarchive.co.uk |date=30 March 2010 |access-date=30 January 2014}}</ref>

"My Little Chickadee" proved to be the band's last hit. In spite of releasing "[[Take a Girl Like You (song)|Take a Girl Like You]]", the title song to the [[Oliver Reed]] and [[Hayley Mills]] [[Take a Girl Like You (film)|film]], and a heavy blues rock song "I'm Gonna Be a Rich Man", the band split in late 1970.<ref>[http://www.kp-agency.com/thefoundations.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828090704/http://www.kp-agency.com/thefoundations.htm |date=28 August 2008 }}</ref>

===1971 to the end of the 1970s===
The last record released in the early 1970s as "The Foundations" was a single "Stoney Ground" b/w "I'll Give You Love" MCA MCA 5075 1971.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jbpco.freeuk.com/UKList/UKF.html |title=F r e e U K – FreeUK Broadband |publisher=Jbpco.freeuk.com |access-date=30 January 2014}}</ref> There would be two more singles released as "The Foundations" in the mid to late 1970s.

When Curtis returned to the UK, he formed a new version of the group with little success in spite of releasing several singles, but later had a lucrative spell on the 1960s nostalgia circuit. Curtis' re-formed Foundations have performed on several occasions and among the many musicians to be part of latter day Foundations were Marcus Williams, Hermann Stosser, Ibicus Bordeaux, Fekete Gabor and Bill<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billspringate.com/bio.htm |title=Bio |publisher=Billspringate.com |access-date=30 January 2014}}</ref> and John Springate, the latter becoming a member of [[The Glitter Band]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alwynwturner.com/glitter/springate.html |title=John Springate |publisher=Alwynwturner.com |access-date=30 January 2014}}</ref> Derek "Del" Watson, Paul Wilmot (all members of the band Elegy) and Roy Carter who later on joined [[Heatwave (band)|Heatwave]].<ref name="terrellissacs1">{{cite web|url=http://www.terrellissacs.net/Roycarter1.htm |title=Home |publisher=Terrellissacs.net |access-date=30 January 2014}}</ref>

Also in the 1970s, there would be a collaborative attempt between two former members of the Foundations. Original Foundations trombonist Eric Allandale attempted to work with original Foundations drummer [[Tim Harris (drummer)|Tim Harris]].<ref name="wilmer">{{cite web|work=The Guardian|title =Eric Allandale: Powerful trombone master of jazz and pop| author=Val Wilmer| author-link=Val Wilmer| url =https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/sep/21/guardianobituaries | date = 21 September 2001| access-date = 26 April 2009 }}</ref>

In the mid-1970s, while Clem Curtis and the Foundations were on the road, there was also another Foundations line-up that was led by Colin Young who were touring at the same time, and were playing basically the same material. This eventually led to court action which resulted in Curtis being allowed to bill his group as either the Foundations or Clem Curtis & the Foundations. Young was allowed to bill himself as "The New Foundations", or as "Colin Young & the New Foundations".<ref name="Baby Now That I've Found You CD inlay booklet notes"/>

Also in the mid-1970s, Young and his group, The New Foundations, released a lone single on Pye, "Something for My Baby" / "I Need Your Love".<ref name="Baby Now That I've Found You CD inlay booklet notes"/> There were actually two more singles released in the late 1970s as the Foundations. They were "Where Were You When I Needed Your Love" / "Love Me Nice and Easy" and "Closer to Loving You" / "Change My Life" on the Summit and [[Psycho Records|Psycho]] labels.<ref name="The Foundations - Discography">{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/artist/the-foundations |title=The Foundations Discography – UK |publisher=45cat |access-date=30 January 2014}}</ref> These featured Curtis as the lead singer.

Various sources erroneously state that there was an early 1970s English line-up that had nothing, or little to do with, the original Foundations. However, Curtis has been leading a new line-up of the Foundations since coming back to the UK and re-forming the group in the early 1970s.

===1980s to present===
There was another line-up formed in 1999 that included Young (vocals), Alan Warner (Guitar), Steve Bingham (bass), Gary Moberly (keyboards), Tony Laidlaw (sax) and Sam Kelly then Steve Dixon (drums). This version of the group was re-formed due to the popularity of the film ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'', and the interest created resulting from the 1968 hit "[[Build Me Up Buttercup]]" being featured in the film. Some time later Young left this version of the group and was replaced by Hue Montgomery (aka Hugh Montgomery).

==Discography==
;Summary of single releases
From the band's beginning to their breakup towards the end of 1970, the Foundations released ten singles in the United Kingdom including two versions of the same song. The majority of the singles were composed by Tony Macaulay and John Macleod. They had four significant hits from these plus a minor hit with one of their own compositions, "Born to Live, Born to Die". They had minor hit with "My Little Chickadee" in the United States. This was written by Tony Macaulay and John Macleod.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Foundations-Soloman-Grundy-My-Little-Chickadee/release/2407195 |title=Foundations, The – My Little Chickadee (Vinyl) at Discogs |publisher=discogs |access-date=30 January 2014}}</ref> There were other titles announced that were either never recorded or were never released. They were "Our Love Went Thataway",<ref name="NME">{{cite book

It is believed that this single was actually by Colin Young and his new backing band Development. It seems quite likely as the Colin Young and Development debut single "Any Time at All" pre-dates "Stoney Ground". In the mid and late 1970s, there were two more singles released under the Foundations name. They were "Where Were You When I Needed Your Love" and "Closer to Loving You" which featured the Northern Soul classic "Change My Life" as the B side. These last two singles to bear the Foundations name featured Clem Curtis once more as the lead vocalist.

;Summary of album releases
During the 1960s, the Foundations recorded and released four LPs in the United Kingdom. Before the release of their debut album, it was originally announced in the October 1967 by ''Beat Instrumental Monthly'', that the debut album's title was to be ''Sound Basis''.<ref name="Beat Instrumental"/> However, when it was released on Pye, it had the title of ''From the Foundations''. The American version of this album, which was released on the Uni label, was given the title of ''Baby, Now That I've Found You''. This album featured Curtis on lead vocals. The next release was in 1968. It was a live LP called ''Rocking the Foundations'', and also featured Curtis on lead vocals plus two instrumentals "[[The Look of Love (1967 song)|The Look of Love]]" and "Coming Home Baby". Also in 1968, another LP was released, this time on the [[Marble Arch Records|Marble Arch]] label. This self-titled third album featured re-recordings of their previous hits and songs, but with Young on vocals instead of Curtis. It also featured a version of a new track, "Build Me Up Buttercup." There was also a second American album released called ''Build Me Up Buttercup''. This release was a [[compilation album|compilation]] of Foundations tracks. Side one consisted of tracks from their ''Rocking the Foundations'' album, while side two consisted of "Build Me Up Buttercup", the B side of that single, plus some earlier Foundations tracks. The group's last LP release was ''Digging The Foundations'' in 1969, which featured their hit "In the Bad Bad Old Days" and the minor US hit "My Little Chickadee". A track "Why Does She Keep On" that was mentioned in the 26 April 1969 issue of ''Billboard'' magazine was not included.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dCgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA60 |title=Billboard – Google Books |date=26 April 1969 |access-date=30 January 2014}}</ref> Since then, there have been various compilations of the Foundations songs, released on both the Golden Hour and PRT labels.
