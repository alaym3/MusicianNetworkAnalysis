==History==
===Formation, first label signing, and ''We Are The Wrecks'' (2014-2017)===

In September 2014, Anderson and Kelley formed a pop-punk band, Coastbound, with three others.<ref>{{cite web |title=coastboundpunk |url=https://www.instagram.com/coastboundpunk/ |website=Instagram}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Coastbound |url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTQdH42HS9POF3KMGv65NKQ/videos?view=0&sort=dd&flow=grid |website=YouTube}}</ref> Coastbound continued performing at local music festivals in [[California]] throughout 2015;<ref>{{cite web |title=Winter Fest |url=https://www.facebook.com/CoastboundPunk/photos/a.785635638192663/813296405426586/ |website=Facebook Announcement |publisher=Local Pop-Punk Coalition}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=SouthBySoWhat?! |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/0c6yEylSB3/ |website=Instagram Announcement |publisher=Hopeless Records Acoustic Stage}}</ref> however, in September 2015, Aaron and Kelley announced their intentions to place the band on a hiatus to pursue a "new music endeavor with an indie rock project."<ref>{{cite web |title=Hiatus Announcement |url=https://twitter.com/coastboundpunk/status/648196355333054464 |website=Twitter}}</ref> Sometime in October 2015, Anderson's new project released a song, "Get 'Em Ready," which features in Episode 5 of [[CBS]]'s ''[[Limitless (TV series)|Limitless]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Limitless Soundtrack Season 1E5 · Personality Crisis |url=https://www.tunefind.com/show/limitless/season-1/25599 |website=Tune Find}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Twitter Announcement |url=https://twitter.com/WeAreTheWrecks/status/656670903418286080 |website=Twitter}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Nick Anderson (The Wrecks) |url=https://twitter.com/WRXNickA/status/1235630038877212673 |website=LACM |publisher=Los Angeles College of Music}}</ref>

Before the release of ''Panic Vertigo'', Anderson labeled the Wrecks an alternative rock band, saying, "I think 'alternative rock' is a really good bubble for us to be in because that allows you to go any which way."<ref>{{cite web |last1=London |first1=Larry |title=Border Crossings: The Wrecks |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehLqkO0n4f4&t=804s |website=YouTube |publisher=VOA Music}}</ref> While Anderson has also described the Wrecks as a [[Rock music|rock]] band, he has acknowledged the versatility of the band's musical style, making it difficult to allot them to a specific genre.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Whelan |first1=Addie |title=Artist of the Week: The Wrecks Q&A |url=https://www.beyondthestagemagazine.com/artist-of-the-week/ |website=Beyond the Stage Magazine}}</ref> With the release of ''Infinitely Ordinary'', the Wrecks ultimately transcended a confinement to any specific genre.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Devine |first1=Anna Milp |title=The Wrecks Release Static EP |url=https://www.noisetrend.com/the-wrecks-release-static-ep/ |website=Noise Trend}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Rollins |first1=Wendy |title=Introducing Nick Anderson-Episode 7 |url=https://open.spotify.com/episode/34H3EPWiVE8Wx1IEDY4SbU?si=yLlrMS42SNaP-nwRIFxRIg |website=Alter Natives |publisher=Spotify}}</ref>

The band's lyrics are primarily written by Anderson and Schmidt.<ref>{{cite web |title=Q&A: Indie Rock’s Best-Kept Secret, The Wrecks, Knock on Stardom With Their ‘Panic Vertigo’ EP |url=https://www.onestowatch.com/blog/qa-indie-rocks-best-kept-secret-the-wrecks |website=Ones to Watch}}</ref> "[Schmizz has] more of a rock brain... I’ve got more of a pop nature," Anderson has noted.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Wrecks Go Hi-LoFi for Debut |url=https://www.prosoundnetwork.com/recording/music-production/the-wrecks-go-hi-lofi-for-debut |website=Prosound Network}}</ref> Their songs are produced using [[Pro Tools]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Harvey |first1=Steve |title=The Wrecks Go Hi-LoFi for Debut |url=https://www.prosoundnetwork.com/recording/music-production/the-wrecks-go-hi-lofi-for-debut |website=Prosound}}</ref> The band has also acknowledged the [[DIY ethic#Music|DIY]] – "low budget, high effort" – attributes of their song production and music videos.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Durden |first1=Ashleigh |title=Alt-Rockers The Wrecks Close Out The Year With Charming New ‘Static’ EP |url=https://worldnewsera.com/news/entertainment/movie-reviews/tom-cruise-rant-parody-has-santa-unleashing-on-rudolph-and-his-elves/ |website=World News Era}}</ref> Even so, the band has denounced the practice of quickly recording songs and uploading them to [[Bandcamp]], instead opting to "[spend] months trying and failing to perfect a mix."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Heilman |first1=Max |title=BottleRock: The Wrecks are the go-getters rock music needs |url=https://riffmagazine.com/features/the-wrecks-go-getters/ |website=Riff Magazine}}</ref>

In regards to their band name, Anderson has stated, "Someone just said it one day. Coming up with a band name sucks."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nunn |first1=Jeremy |title=Nick Anderson The Wrecks talk about the band, return to Chicago |url=https://chicago.gopride.com/news/article.cfm/articleid/I1252084#:~:text=The%20group%20is%20composed%20of,Westen%20Weiss%20and%20Billy%20Nally. |website=Chicago: Go Proud}}</ref> On another occasion, Anderson has joked about the band name stemming from a traffic accident the band members were in:
{{cquote|[We were involved in a] five car pile-up on the north-eastern shore of New Jersey... in the middle of [[U.S. Route 9 in New Jersey|Route 9]]... turns out, none of us had insurance on our vehicles, so we decided to start a band, name it 'The Wrecks,' and use the money we make to pay for our excessive mechanic bills.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Whelan |first1=Addie |title=Artist of the Week: The Wrecks Q&A |url=https://www.beyondthestagemagazine.com/artist-of-the-week/ |website=Beyond the Stage Magazine}}</ref>}}
The Wrecks often utilize the namesake of their first EP, ''We Are The Wrecks'', as a social media handle – namely on Twitter, [[Instagram]], and for their website.

When asked about the robot that appears on promotional imagery and merchandise, Anderson said, "The ''We Are The Wrecks'' EP cover features a robot. His name is Otis. He's basically become the band mascot."<ref>{{cite web |title=The Wrecks |url=https://twitter.com/WeAreTheWrecks/status/843280763365867522 |website=Twitter}}</ref> Additionally, he said, "The identity of the robot is currently a secret... [that will] unravel eventually."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Coveleskie |first1=Kristen |title=The Wrecks |url=http://iamhighvoltage.com/2016/02/13/the-wrecks/ |website=High Voltage}}</ref> The robot iconography is also featured in the "Favorite Liar" music video and was the namesake of the Wrecks' first tour, the "Robot Army Tour." Furthermore, the band's [[fandom]] has been dubbed the "Robot Army."<ref>{{cite web |title=The Wrecks |url=https://twitter.com/WeAreTheWrecks/status/881052039001894912 |website=Twitter}}</ref>
