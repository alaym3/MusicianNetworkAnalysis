'''The Stone Roses''' are an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Manchester]] in 1983. One of the pioneering groups of the [[Madchester]] movement in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the band's classic and most prominent lineup consisted of vocalist [[Ian Brown]], guitarist [[John Squire]], bassist [[Mani (musician)|Mani]] and drummer [[Reni (musician)|Reni]].

The band released their debut album, ''[[The Stone Roses (album)|The Stone Roses]]'', in 1989. The album was a breakthrough success for the band and received critical acclaim, many{{who?|date=August 2021}} regarding it as one of the greatest British albums ever recorded. At this time the group decided to capitalise on their success by signing to a major label. Their record label at the time, [[Silvertone Records (1980)|Silvertone]], would not let them out of their contract, which led to a long legal battle that culminated with the band signing with [[Geffen Records]] in 1991.

The Stone Roses then released their second album, ''[[Second Coming (The Stone Roses album)|Second Coming]]'', in 1994, which was met with mixed reviews.<ref name="VoxFeb1995">{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Johnny|title=Coming Out|url=http://www.thestoneroses.co.uk/press/vox-february-1995|access-date=24 November 2011|newspaper=Vox|date=February 1995|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312041444/http://www.thestoneroses.co.uk/press/vox-february-1995 |archive-date=12 March 2010|pages=14–19|format=print}}</ref> The group soon disbanded after several line-up changes throughout the supporting tour, which began with Reni departing in early 1995, followed by Squire in April 1996. Brown and Mani dissolved the remains of the group in October 1996 following their appearance at [[Reading Festival]].

Following much intensified media speculation, The Stone Roses called a press conference on 18 October 2011 to announce that the band had reunited and would perform a [[Reunion Tour (The Stone Roses)|reunion world tour]] in 2012, including three homecoming shows in [[Heaton Park]], Manchester.<ref name="officialreunion">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/the-stone-roses/59839 |title=Ian Brown on the Stone Roses reunion: 'It's happening' |work=NME |date=17 October 2011 |access-date=17 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/18/stone-roses-reunite-world-tour?newsfeed=true|title=Stone Roses announce comeback gigs in Manchester with world tour in pipeline|date=18 October 2011|work=guardian.co.uk|access-date=18 October 2011|last=Topping|first=Alexandra|location=London|publisher=Guardian News and Media}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15348374|title=The Stone Roses to reunite for tour|date=18 October 2011|work=BBC News|access-date=18 October 2011}}</ref> Plans to record a third album in the future were also floated but only two singles were released.<ref name="newalbum">{{cite web|url=http://www.thespacelab.tv/spaceLAB/2011/10October/MusicNews-059-Stone-Roses-Reunion-Tour-New-Album-Press-Conference.htm|title=Stone Roses Reunion Tour and New Album is Happening|date=18 October 2011|work=Spacelab|access-date=18 October 2011}}</ref> In June 2012, Chris Coghill, the writer of a new [[Spike Island (film)|film]] which is set during the Stone Roses 1990 Spike Island show, revealed that the band "have at least three or four new tracks recorded".<ref name="Benson">''SSG Music'' (2012) [http://www.ssgmusic.com/stone-roses-confirm-new-material/ "Stone Roses Have Recorded New Material"]</ref><ref name="NME">''NME'' (2012) [https://www.nme.com/news/the-stone-roses/63911 "The Stone Roses have at least three or four new tracks recorded"]</ref> In June 2013, a documentary about the band's reformation directed by [[Shane Meadows]] and titled ''[[The Stone Roses: Made of Stone]]'' was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2126403/|title=The Stone Roses: Made of Stone (2013)|website=IMDb.com|access-date=2016-03-14}}</ref>

In 2016, they released their first new material in two decades. The band members continued to tour until June 2017, at which point cryptic remarks by Brown indicated the band had split again, later confirmed in a 2019 interview with Squire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/sep/16/john-squire-interview|title=John Squire: 'I don't think I'm a very good guitar player – or painter'|website=theguardian.com|date=16 September 2019|access-date=2019-09-17}}</ref>

==History==

===Formation (1983–1984)===
[[Ian Brown]] (at the time the bassist) and guitarist [[John Squire]], who knew each other from [[Altrincham Grammar School for Boys]], formed a short-lived [[The Clash|Clash]]-inspired band called The Patrol in 1980 along with singer/guitarist Andy Couzens and drummer [[Simon Wolstencroft]].<ref>Robb, p. 40</ref><ref name="Taylor">Taylor (2004)</ref> They played several gigs in 1980 and recorded a [[demo tape]], but towards the end of that year decided on a change of direction.<ref name="Robb46">Robb, p. 46</ref> Brown had got a taste of being a frontman during the last Patrol show, singing [[The Sweet|Sweet]]'s "[[Block Buster!]]" to close the set, with the band's friend/roadie Pete Garner standing in on bass, and Couzens wanting to concentrate on guitar.<ref name="Robb46" /> The band members lost enthusiasm in 1981, Brown selling his bass guitar to buy a scooter, and Wolstencroft joined [[Johnny Marr]] and [[Andy Rourke]]'s pre-[[The Smiths|Smiths]] band [[Freak Party]].<ref name="Robb48">Robb, p. 48</ref> Squire continued to practise guitar<ref name="Taylor" /> while working as an animator for [[Cosgrove Hall]] during the day, while Brown ran a [[Northern soul]] night in a [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] club. 
Squire and Couzens started a new band, The Fireside Chaps, with bassist Gary "Mani" Mounfield, later recruiting a singer named David "Kaiser" Carty and drummer Chris Goodwin, and changing their name to The Waterfront (after the film ''[[On the Waterfront]]''), their sound influenced by 1960s groups and contemporary bands such as [[Orange Juice (band)|Orange Juice]].<ref name="Taylor" /><ref name="Robb65">Robb, p. 65, 68</ref> Goodwin left before the band recorded their first demo and, shortly after the demo, Squire asked Brown to join as singer. A meeting with [[Geno Washington]] at a party at Brown's flat in Hulme, in which Washington told Brown that he would be a star and should be a singer, convinced Brown to take Squire up on his offer.<ref>Robb, p.&nbsp;70–71</ref> Brown joined The Waterfront in late 1983, for a time sharing vocals with Kaiser (Dave Carty).<ref>Robb, p. 71</ref>

Like the earlier attempts at bands, The Waterfront fizzled out, but in late 1983 Couzens decided to try again at starting a band, and approached Brown.<ref>Robb, p. 77</ref> They decided on Wolstencroft (who had turned down the job of drummer in The Smiths) as drummer and Pete Garner as bassist (despite his admission that he could not play anything but "Block Buster!").<ref name="Robb78">Robb, p. 78</ref> They also decided that they needed Squire in the band, and when he agreed the band's line-up was cemented.<ref name="Robb78" /> Leaving their previous bands behind, they worked solely on new material. Brown's vocal limitations prompted him to take singing lessons for three weeks.<ref>Robb, p. 79</ref> After rehearsing for some time without a band name, Squire came up with "The Stone Roses". Several stories later emerged suggesting that the band had initially been called "English Rose" or that the name was somehow linked to [[The Rolling Stones]], but these were untrue, Brown explaining "No, I don't know where that English Rose story came from. John thought up the name 'Stone Roses' - something with a contrast, two words that went against each other".<ref>Robb, p. 80</ref> The band rehearsed for six months, during which time Wolstencroft had been auditioning for other bands, and he left to join [[Terry Hall (singer)|Terry Hall]]'s band [[The Colourfield]].<ref>Robb, p. 81</ref> They got Goodwin to rejoin, but he lasted for only one rehearsal, so they advertised for a replacement and began auditioning, eventually recruiting Alan "Reni" Wren in May 1984.<ref>Robb, p.&nbsp;83–4</ref>

After rehearsing and writing songs over the summer, they recorded their first demo in late August, making 100 cassettes, with artwork by Squire, and set about trying to get gigs.<ref>Robb, p. 91</ref> They played their first gig as the Stone Roses on 23 October 1984, supporting [[Pete Townshend]] at an anti-[[heroin]] concert at the Moonlight Club in London, Brown having sent the demo with an accompanying letter stating "I'm surrounded by skagheads, I wanna smash 'em. Can you give us a show?".<ref name="Robb92">Robb, p.&nbsp;91–92</ref> The show was seen by journalists including ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]''{{'}} Garry Johnson, who arranged to interview the band a few weeks later.<ref>Robb, p. 98</ref> The band received management offers and more gigs soon followed.

Howard Jones, who had recently left his job as manager of [[The Haçienda]], producer [[Martin Hannett]], and Tim Chambers agreed to work with the band on an album, setting up Thin Line Records to release it, with Jones taking on management of the band, although they had already made a similar agreement with Caroline Reed in London.<ref>Robb, p.&nbsp;99–100</ref> The band got their first positive press in late December, with Johnson tipping them for success in 1985 in ''Sounds'', with a feature on the band following in January.<ref>Robb, p. 107</ref>

===Early tour and releases (1985–1988)===
The band played their first headlining gig on 4 January 1985, supported by [[Last Party]], after original headliners Mercenary Skank had pulled out.<ref>Robb, p. 108</ref> The band had their first recording session with Hannett in January 1985 at Strawberry Studios in [[Stockport]], aiming to record tracks for a debut single and an album.<ref>Robb, p. 103</ref> Further sessions followed in March, during which they recorded their debut single, the [[double A-side]] "[[So Young (The Stone Roses song)|So Young]]"/"Tell Me".<ref>Robb, p. 110</ref> The band were invited to play a live session on [[Piccadilly Radio]] in March, for which they premiered a new song, "I Wanna Be Adored".<ref>Robb, p. 113</ref> Tony Michaelides AKA Tony the Greek from the station arranged for five local bands to play at [[Dingwalls]] in London on February 8th.Glee Company, Communal Drop, Fictitious Names, Laugh and The Stone Roses. Compère for the night was another Piccadilly DJ [[Mark Radcliffe (radio broadcaster)|Mark Radcliffe]]. By this time they had started to build a sizeable following in Manchester, and their first gig in the North of England at Clouds in [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] attracted a large audience, but descended into a riot after technical problems and friction between the bands on the bill.<ref>Robb, p.&nbsp;115–7</ref>

The Roses embarked on a tour of Sweden in April, with their first gig in Manchester following on their return, at [[The International Nightclub Manchester|International 1]], a venue run by future Stone Roses managers Matthew Cummings and Gareth Evans.<ref>Robb, p. 122</ref> A performance at a warehouse party on 20 July helped to build interest in the band, and in August they returned to the studio to record their debut album.<ref>Robb, p. 128</ref> Unhappy with the results, and with the band's sound changing, it was shelved (it was later released as ''[[Garage Flower]]'').<ref name="Taylor" /> The "So Young"/"Tell Me" single, however, was released in September.

Frustrated with the lack of attention they were getting locally, they engaged in a graffiti campaign, with Brown and Wren spraying the band's name on walls from [[West Didsbury]] to the city centre.<ref>Robb, p. 138</ref> It brought them much negative publicity, but added to their increasing notoriety. In 1986 they began working on new material, including "[[Sally Cinnamon]]", and the planned follow-up singles to "So Young" ("I Wanna Be Adored" and "This Is the One") were shelved.<ref>Robb, p. 143</ref> They parted company with Jones and took on Gareth Evans as manager, using Evans' International 1 venue as their new rehearsal space. Around this time the band played several UK tour dates including 11 August 1986 at the Mardi Gras club in Liverpool with local promoter and record label owner Ken Kelly and his band Innervision at which several record company executives would be in attendance.<ref>Robb, p.&nbsp;146–8</ref>

As Brown and Squire began collaborating more closely on songwriting, they decided that they should take a larger slice of the money than the other band members. Couzens and Wren left the band in protest, although they soon returned. Couzens played an ill-fated gig with the band at the end of May before being pushed out of the band by Evans after flying home alone while the rest of the band returned in their van.<ref>Robb, p. 150</ref> Although they failed to achieve further success in 1986, their repertoire expanded to include songs such as "Sugar Spun Sister", taking on influences from bands such as [[The Jesus & Mary Chain]] and the indie-pop era [[Primal Scream]] ("[[Velocity Girl (song)|Velocity Girl]]" being a major influence on "Made of Stone"), and they stopped playing the older songs.<ref>Robb, p.&nbsp;154–5</ref>

In December 1986 they recorded their first demo as a four-piece, including the first studio recordings of "Sugar Spun Sister" and "Elephant Stone".<ref>Robb, p. 156</ref> In early 1987, Evans negotiated a deal with [[Revolver Music|Black/FM Revolver]] for a one-off release on the specially created Black Records label. By the time of the release of the single, "Sally Cinnamon", the group's sound had changed considerably, with chiming guitar [[Hook (music)|hooks]] and a strong melody, alienating some of their old fans, but attracting many new ones.<ref>Robb, p. 162</ref> "Sally Cinnamon" sold out its 1,000-copy run, but failed to make the desired impact.

In June, Garner announced that he had decided to leave the band, although he stayed until they found a replacement. He played his final gig with the band at the 'Larks in the Park' festival in Liverpool.<ref name="Robb166">Robb, p. 166</ref> Rob Hampson was Garner's replacement, with Garner teaching him the bass parts before leaving, although Hampson lasted only a week.<ref name="Robb167">Robb, p. 167</ref> A more permanent replacement was found in the form of former-Waterfront bassist Mani ([[Mani (musician)|Gary Mounfield]]), who played his first gig with the band in November 1987.<ref name="Robb167" /> Brown recalled, "When Mani joined it almost changed overnight. It became a totally different groove&nbsp;... Straight away, everything just fell into place".<ref name="McCready">McReady</ref>

In early 1988 the band played at Dingwalls in London, a show attended by representatives of [[Zomba Music Group|Zomba]] and [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]]'s [[Geoff Travis]], and both subsequently wanted to sign the band. Rough Trade even funded studio time to record a single, "[[Elephant Stone]]", with [[Peter Hook]] producing.<ref>Robb, p. 173</ref> Hook was considered to produce an album for the band, but was unavailable due to commitments with [[New Order (band)|New Order]], so Travis suggested [[John Leckie]].<ref>Robb, p. 176</ref> In May the band played a high-profile concert at Manchester's International II with [[James (band)|James]] organized by [[Dave Haslam]] to raise funds for a campaign against [[Section 28|Clause 28]].<ref name="Haslam">Haslam, p. 180</ref> The band attempted to usurp James by putting up posters around town listing the Stone Roses as headliners, and delaying their start time to get the headline time themselves and limit the time that James could play for.<ref>Robb, p. 180</ref> In the audience was a sixteen-year-old [[Liam Gallagher]], for whom it was the inspiration to form a band himself.<ref>Robb, p. 181</ref> [[Noel Gallagher]] too has stated that he was inspired to the same by attending one of their gigs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfR6JoDExcc |title=Noel Gallagher about Stone Roses |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-02-06 |access-date=2014-02-27}}</ref> Also in the audience was Glaswegian Roddy McKenna, [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] executive with Zomba, who later signed the band to the label. He asked if they could be transferred internally to Andrew Lauder's newly created guitar-based Silvertone Records subsidiary. The band were signed to an eight-album deal, buying the "Elephant Stone" tapes from Rough Trade and releasing them as a single in October 1988.

The band were co-managed by Matthew Cummings who died in 2007 following an accident.

===Debut album and breakthrough success (1989–1991)===
{{main|The Stone Roses (album)}}

In 1988 and early 1989 the Stone Roses recorded their debut album at Battery Studios and [[Konk (recording)|Konk Studios]] in London and [[Rockfield Studios]] in Wales, produced by Leckie.<ref name="Taylor" /> The first single for Silvertone, "[[Elephant Stone]]", made little impact, and in early 1989 the band's performances outside the north-west were still attracting small audiences.<ref>Robb, p. 195</ref> "[[Made of Stone]]" received more press attention and was picked up for airplay by DJ [[Richard Skinner (broadcaster)|Richard Skinner]] on his late night Radio One show, but peaked at number ninety on the [[UK Singles Chart]].

===''Second Coming'' and breakup (1992–1996)===
{{Main|Second Coming (The Stone Roses album)}}
Following the court case the Stone Roses separated themselves from Manchester's club culture and spent much of 1992 and 1993 travelling in Europe before starting work on their second album in mid-1993. Progress was slow, hampered by Brown's and Squire's new fatherhood and the death of several people close to the band. John Leckie ultimately left the project as the band would not sign a production contract. Afterwards the Stone Roses assumed production duties with engineer Simon Dawson at [[Rockfield Studios]] in Wales, where they spent 347 ten-hour days working on the album.<ref name="Spin 1995" />

The Stone Roses finally released the album, ''[[Second Coming (The Stone Roses album)|Second Coming]]'', on 5 December 1994.<ref name=VoxFeb1995 /><ref name="Spin 1995" /> Mostly written by John Squire, the music now had a shady, heavy [[blues rock]] sound. "[[Love Spreads]]" reached number two on the UK Singles Chart.<ref name="guinness_book" /> ''Second Coming'' received a mixed reception from the British press, which music journalist [[Simon Reynolds]] attributed to "the resentment that the Roses, divorced from the cultural moment that gave them meaning, were now just another band".<ref name="Spin 1995" />

In March 1995, just two weeks before a tour in support of ''Second Coming'' was due to begin, Reni exited the band, following a disagreement with Ian Brown.<ref name="SquireInterview">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWYWKqast70 | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211102/jWYWKqast70| archive-date=2021-11-02 | url-status=live|title=John Squire Stone Roses XFM Interview With Dave Haslam |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-01-07 |access-date=2016-03-14}}{{cbignore}}</ref> A replacement drummer was found in Robbie Maddix, who had previously worked with [[Rebel MC]].<ref name="Larkin">Larkin, Colin (ed.)

A secret "come-back" tour of the UK was planned for April 1995 but cancelled after the music press announced the dates. A major blow was the cancellation of their engagement at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] in June 1995. John Squire had suffered a mountain-biking accident in northern California weeks before the show, breaking his collarbone.<ref name="Strong2003" /> The band finally organised a full UK tour for November and December 1995 and all dates sold out in a day.

[[John Squire]] announced his departure on 1 April 1996, releasing a statement saying it was: "the inevitable conclusion to the gradual social and musical separation that we have undergone in the past few years".<ref name="Larkin" /> [[Simply Red]]'s 1987/88 tour guitarist [[Aziz Ibrahim]], a former classmate of Pete Garner's at Burnage High School, was recruited as a replacement. The band continued for another six months, but there was a noticeable deterioration in the quality of its public performances after Squire's loss, and at [[Benicassim festival|Benicassim Festival]] and the [[Reading Festival]] Brown's voice was described as "so off-key it was excruciating to have to listen".<ref name="Larkin" /> The music press was united in its criticism, the ''NME'' describing "I Am the Resurrection" as "more like the eternal crucifixion".<ref name="TWGOAT">Perrone, Pierre (2008) "[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/music-magazine/music-magazine-features/the-worst-gigs-of-all-time-772912.html The worst gigs of all time]", ''[[The Independent]]'', 24 January 2008</ref> Brown and Mani dissolved the group in October 1996.<ref name="Larkin" />

Ian Brown, John Squire and Mani have all had successful careers since the Roses' breakup. Squire formed [[The Seahorses]], who released one album before breaking up, as well as releasing two solo albums. In 2007 he told a reporter that he was giving up music for good to focus on his career as a painter.<ref name="giving up">{{cite news|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/p/1010580|title=Roses legend gives up music|work=Manchester Evening News|date=5 July 2007|last=Bourne|first=Dianne|access-date=15 September 2007|publisher=M.E.N.

Reni remained inactive for the most part after the Roses' breakup. He started a new band called [[The Rub]] in 1999, and played several gigs but nothing has been heard of The Rub since.

===Reunion, new material and second disbandment (2011–2017)===
{{main|Reunion Tour (The Stone Roses)}}
After the newspaper ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' published a story on 14 October 2011 citing that the Roses had signed for a series of gigs across the UK, rumours again began to circulate. The ''NME'' reported that [[Reni (musician)|Alan 'Reni' Wren]] had responded to these rumours, contacting them with a cryptic message that read: "Not before 9T will I wear the hat 4 the Roses again".<ref name="officialreunion" /> On 17 October, [[Dynamo (magician)|Dynamo]] told ''The Sun'' that Brown had confirmed the reunion by saying that the band were "ready to take the world by storm", and that Brown had sent him a text message with the words "It's happening".<ref name="officialreunion" /> On 18 October 2011, the Stone Roses announced at a press conference the end of a fifteen-year split.

==Relationship with the media==
During the band's time in the public eye, their relationship with the mass media was notably different from other bands before and after. The members would often display no interest in promoting themselves, which was typified through reticent and capricious behaviour. Even with The Stone Roses' reformation in 2011, the group continued to provide few interviews. This approach left many journalists confused and sometimes angered.

A typical example is the Spike Island press conference in 1990, which was attended by much of the world's music press. This ended in chaos when the gathered journalists began a small riot, believing the band to be deliberately upsetting them.

As John Robb commented: "The Stone Roses would stonewall the journalist[s]. With shy guffaws, muttered asides, dispassionate staring, foot-shuffling silences and complete mind-numbing gaps, punctuated by the odd piece of incisive home-spun philosophy from Brown, who occasionally hinted at a well-read mind. There would be complete silence from John Squire, witty banter from Reni, and Mani spouting off if he let his guard drop."<ref name="Robb, P. 225">Robb, P. 225</ref> However, Robb clarified they "were no fools when it came to the media".<ref name="Robb, P. 225"/> He concluded: "One feature of the band's career had been their ability to stay on the news pages of the rock press almost permanently for years on end, including the years when they did fuck all. And they did this by hardly saying anything at all."<ref name="Robb, P. 225"/>

Although the aforementioned reformation conference in October 2011 displayed an elated and talkative Stone Roses engaging with the press, it was followed by total media silence. Other than [[Shane Meadows]]' documentary in 2013, the band provided no further interviews.
