'''Mgła''' ({{IPAc-pl|m|g|ł|a}}; {{lang-en|"Fog"}}) is a Polish [[black metal]] band.

==History==
Initially founded as a studio project in the year 2000 at [[Kraków]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/mgla |title=Albums by Mgła |publisher= rateyourmusic.com |accessdate=25 October 2015}}</ref> by vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Mikołaj "M." Żentara with the collaboration of drummer Dariusz "Daren" Piper, both originally from the band Kriegsmaschine,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spirit-of-metal.com/fr/band/Kriegsmaschine|title=Kriegsmaschine - discographie, line-up, biographie, interviews, photos|website=www.spirit-of-metal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-07}}</ref> together they recorded two unreleased demos, a collaboration split album with [[Deathspell Omega]], [[Clandestine Blaze]], [[Stabat Mater (band)|Stabat Mater]], [[Exordium (band)|Exordium]] and Musta Surma and their first 2 EPs. Daren left the band in 2006 and was replaced by Maciej "Darkside" Kowalski. The band signed to [[Northern Heritage Records]] in 2008 and released their debut album ''Groza'' in that same year, Mgła has been signed to Northern Heritage ever since.

In 2012 after the release of ''With Hearts Toward None'' the band started touring worldwide, they enlisted bassist The Fall and guitarist Silencer, originally from Black metal band Medico Peste, to complete their live lineup and according to M. rehearsed for over a year before hitting the road.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metalstorm.net/bands/band.php?band_id=1951|title=Mgła - Metal Storm|website=www.metalstorm.net|access-date=2018-05-07}}</ref> In 2015 Silencer left the band and was replaced by E.V.T., also from Medico Peste, as live guitarist. The tour, which helped the band to gain notoriety, had various notable performances at well known metal festivals like Nidrosian Black Mass on Belgium, [[Brutal Assault]] on the Czech Republic and Dark Easter Metal Meeting and Party San on Germany. During the same year M. and Darkside created "No Solace"; a label and mailorder in which they catalogue the music from Mgła and other projects. Through "No Solace" M. and Darkside also release music under the Kriegsmaschine moniker.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.no-solace.com/ns.html|title=No Solace|website=No Solace}}</ref> No Solace is also the name of Żentara's music studio.
From 2015 to 2016, the band's lineup joined Mikko Aspa's Clandestine Blaze for various shows.

On October 21, 2018 alongside the release of the third Kriegsmaschine album, the band announced they were working on their fourth studio album and that it would be released in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/422295657874462/posts/1625356400901709/|title=Album announcements|author=|date=October 21, 2018|website=Facebook|accessdate=21 October 2018}}</ref> On August 3, 2019 the band revealed that their fourth album would be titled ''Age of Excuse'' and released the track "Age of Excuse II" on the No Solace YouTube channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/422295657874462/posts/2029327900504555/|title="Age of excuse", the fourth full-length album of Mgła is coming soon.|author=|date=August 3, 2019|website=Facebook|accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0ryOwlXkP4&fbclid=IwAR17MTg3SmjNv6xVEtvbaCFm2apQBFMgiYstb3-|title=Mgła "Age of excuse II"|author=|date=August 3, 2019|website=YouTube|accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref> ''Age of Excuse'' was released on September 2, 2019 on the band's [[Bandcamp]] and on CD through their label No Solace in collaboration with Northern Heritage, they also uploaded the album on streaming sites a week after the initial CD release. Northern Heritage released the vinyl version of the album on January 24, 2020. The band announced a European tour that lasted throughout September 2019 in support of the new album, and they also embarked on their first Latin American tour on the first quarter of 2020 but had to postpone or cancel future performances due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].

==Controversy==
In April 2019 the band went on a European tour with [[Revenge (Canadian band)|Revenge]] alongside guest bands Doombringer and Deus Mortem which was marred with controversy and two cancelled shows on [[Munich]] and [[Berlin]] after the German [[Antifa (Germany)|Antifa]] group "Linkes Bündnis gegen Antisemitismus München" (English: Left Alliance Against Anti-Semitism Munich) launched a boycott against Mgła because of their alleged associations to various [[National Socialist black metal]] artists, and accusing them of racism and Anti-Semitism. The group listed Mgła being signed to [[Mikko Aspa]]'s label [[Northern Heritage Records]]; Aspa has long been accused of having extreme [[Far-right politics|Far-right]] sympathies and ties with the NSBM scene in Finland and throughout Europe, the band's association with fellow Polish black metal band and tour mates Deus Mortem; which has members who on occasions played live with the openly [[Rock Against Communism|RAC]] Polish band Honor, and NSBM bands Warhead and Thunderbolt as well as Mikołaj Żentara's past [[dark ambient]] project "Leichenhalle", which one of its albums is titled “Judenfrei” (English: Free of Jews). Mgła have denied the accusations and proceeded to pursue legal action against "Linkes Bündnis" and the  sites that published their accusations, which the band described as false, a coordinated smear campaign and "defamation in print", they also asked fans to share the "defamatory publications" to support their case while offering apologies and discounts on the band's web store to those who planned to attend the cancelled concerts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/422295657874462/posts/1876988525738494/|title=Cancelled concerts announcement|website=Facebook|access-date=2019-04-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/mgla-deny-racism-accusations-give-statement-on-show-cancellations/|title=Mgła deny racism accusations, give statement on show cancellations|website=www.brooklynvegan.com|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2019/04/30/two-mgla-shows-have-been-canceled-amidst-ties-to-nsbm/|title=Two Mgła Shows Have Been Canceled Amidst Ties to NSBM|website=MetalSucks|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metaladdicts.com/site/two-mgla-shows-in-germany-cancelled-over-racism-accusations/|title=Two MGŁA Shows In Germany Cancelled Over Racism Accusations|author=Reeder|website=Metal Addicts|access-date=2019-05-02}}</ref>
