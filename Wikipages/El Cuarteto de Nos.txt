'''El Cuarteto de Nos''' (stylized as '''Cuarteto de Nos''') is an Uruguayan [[Rock music|rock]] group formed in 1980 in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]]. Over the years, due to its particular sound that mixes elements of [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[alternative rock]], [[comedy rock]] and [[Latin music]], the group has developed an immense amount of popularity and praise in [[Latin America]] and [[Hispanic]] countries. 

El Cuarteto is the oldest active Uruguayan band.{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}} It has gained universal praise, transcending local culture through universal themes and engaging everyday pathos in a humorous light. They have released a total of 16 studio albums since 1984, as well as two compilation albums ''La Misma Porquería'' (1995) & ''Lo Mejor de... Cuarteto de Nos'' (2010) on numerous record labels, including Ayuí/Tacuabé, Orfeo, [[Sony BMG]], [[Koala Records]], Manzana Verde, [[Bizarro Records]], [[EMI]], and Warner Music. They have experimented with many [[Music genre|genres]], and are one of the most important and recognized bands from Uruguay and [[Latin America]] in general. They have had only one change of membership since 1987.

== Summary ==
The group was started by the Musso Brothers, [[Roberto Musso]] (vocals and guitars) and [[Ricardo Musso]] a.k.a. Riki Musso (guitars and keyboards). From childhood, they listened to [[The Beatles]] and other bands that served as inspiration. They created an imaginary town named Tajo. Tajo's characters, places, and situations inspired the music in their first records. They were later joined by bassist [[Santiago Tavella]], with whom they started playing instrumentals and Beatles [[Cover version|covers]] at schools and theaters. They were hesitant at first to play original material, which was written by all three of them with comedic elements ranging from [[dark humor]] to [[slapstick]]. Contrary to their expectations, they began attracting more people to their shows as they allowed their ideas to shine. Once censorship ended in 1985 with the restoration of [[democracy]] after the [[Civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay|dictatorship]], the indie record label [[Ayuí]] offered the group the opportunity to release a shared album with artist Alberto Wolf. They agreed, and their resulting debut record ''[[Alberto Wolf y el Cuarteto de Nos]]'' featured one side with music from the group and guest drummer Leonardo Baroncini and the other side by Alberto.

In the same year, they officially performed on stage for the first time at the "Feria de Villa Biarritz" with their newly recruited drummer, [[Alvaro Pintos]]. They performed with outfits made out of tin and balloons attached to their heads, presenting themselves to the public with a creative identity. They also assisted the largest [[music festival]] to date in Uruguay, the [[Montevideo Rock]], with an audience of 60,000. In 1987, they released their first stand-alone [[LP record|LP]] titled ''[[Soy una Arveja]]'' (''I am a Pea''), followed by ''{{ill|Emilio García (album)|lt=Emilio García|es|Emilio García (álbum)}}'' the following year. For their third individual record, their songwriting moved away from topics related to Tajo, resulting in a more cohesive and mature sounding album that was only released on [[Cassette tape|cassette]] by their new label, [[Orfeo (record label)|Orfeo]]. The 1991 album ''[[Canciones del Corazón]]'' (''Songs from the Heart'') represented an important era in the band's history, delivering the first hits by the group with songs such as "Al Cielo No" (''Not to Heaven'') and "Corazón Maricón" (''My Gay Heart''), which showed a more experimental side of their music.

However, their fame in the country appeared with the 1994 album ''[[Otra Navidad en las Trincheras]]'' (''Another Christmas in the Trenches''), a longer album that incorporated sounds of [[salsa music|salsa]], [[electronic music]] and [[hard rock]], with a bevy of sarcastic and politically incorrect lyrics. This was their first record released in a [[CD]] format, unusual for the time, and to this date it is the best-selling rock album in Uruguay, obtaining 4 [[platinum records]] and massive overnight popularity for the band. This wave of success for the group extended to 1995's ''[[Barranca Abajo]]'' (''Downhill''), and their 1996 album ''[[El Tren Bala]]'' (''The Bullet Train''), which was also the first and only time that the government tried to censor an album, since the dictatorship had ended, in response to the polemic song "El Día que Artigas se Emborrachó" (''The day Artigas got Drunk'').

The popularity of the band, however, started to decline in mid-1997 when they were working on their eighth studio album, ''[[Revista ¡¡Ésta!!]]'' (''This one!! Magazine''), which was released in 1998 to lukewarm sales and reception, a result that extended to their 2000 decade opener ''[[Cortamambo]]'' (''Killjoy''), an album which, nevertheless, gained a cult following over the years. This album also resulted in Riki Musso leaving the group for most of 2001, due to issues he had with the album cover. However, their fate would completely change in 2004 when they decided to go for international success by re-recording the best songs from every album to date with a better, more consistent production achieved by [[Juan Campodónico]]. Their self-titled ''Greatest Hits'', made noise outside of Uruguay. Two years later they release their most famous and acclaimed record, 2006 Grammy-nominated ''[[Raro]]'' (''Weird''), an album which, according to many,{{whom|date=August 2021}} marks the breaking point between the old and new Cuarteto de Nos, given the change in music style to a more rap-centric [[lyricism]], and a more straightforward alternative rock.

In 2009 they released ''{{ill|Bipolar (El Cuarteto de Nos album)|lt=Bipolar|es|Bipolar (álbum de El Cuarteto de Nos)}}'', the last album to feature ''Riki Musso'' (who left due to creative differences) resulting in the follow-up ''[[Porfiado]]'' (''Obstinate'') featuring two new members: [[Gustavo "el Topo" Acuña]] on guitars, and [[Santiago Marrero]] on keyboards. It also gave them several [[Latin Grammy]] Awards in 2012. Two years later, they released ''[[Habla tu Espejo]]'' (''Your Mirror is Talking''), a more ballad-centric record which goes further into experimentation with [[synthesizers]] and more radio-friendly instrumentation that still applies many layers of arrangements. A similar formula was repeated on the successful 2017 album ''[[Apocalipsis Zombi]]'' (''Zombie Apocalypse''), and their last record to date, ''[[Jueves]]'' (''Thursday''), released in 2019.


== History ==

=== Beginnings ===
In 1984, El Cuarteto de Nos played their first show, an instrumental set in the "El Tinglado" theater.<ref name="Newspaper">{{cite news|url=http://www.lr21.com.uy/cultura/214816-rarezas-del-cuarteto-de-nos-en-escena|title=Rarezas del Cuarteto de Nos en escena|agency=LaRed21|language=Spanish|date=June 22, 2006|accessdate=June 7, 2010}}</ref> They also played at the "La Máscara", "El Circular", "Teatro de la Alianza Francesa" theaters while developing their own musical style. In 1984, their first [[album]] was released, in collaboration with Alberto Wolf, whom had six of the twelve songs; and [[drummer]] Álvaro Pintos joined the group afterwards.

In 1985, they stepped on a stage, located in a [[Street fair|fair]] from [[Villa Biarritz]], dressed up with [[aluminum foil]] on their legs and [[balloons]] tied to their heads.<ref name="History">[http://www.viajeauruguay.com/espectaculos/el-cuarteto-de-nos-un-grupo-raro.php Historia del Cuarteto de Nos, un grupo raro] (in Spanish) retrieved June 7, 2010.</ref>

=== First albums ===
In 1986, they edited their first [[LP album|LP]], ''Soy una Arveja'' (I am a Pea), on which they performed some hits.<ref name="Newspaper"/> The following year, band members dressed up as elderly women to promote the song ''Soy una Vieja'' (I am an Old Lady).<ref name="History"/>
In 1988, their second album, ''Emilio García'' (by then, the [[fictional]] manager), was released.<ref name="History"/>

In 1991, the album ''Canciones del Corazón'' (Songs of the Heart) was released in [[Compact Cassette|cassette]], and it was a great commercial success for the band.

=== Unexpected success ===
In 1994, after four years of hiatus, they released their album ''Otra Navidad en las Trincheras'' (Another Christmas in the Trenches), which achieved quadruple platinum status almost instantly, making them the first Uruguayan band ever to achieve it.<ref name="History"/>  This album has a wider musical amplitude, having mixed [[salsa music|salsa]], [[rock music|music]], and [[electronic music]], in the band's usual mocking style, the most successful songs of this album were "Sólo un rumor" (Just a Rumour), "El primer oriental desertor" (The First [[Uruguay]]an Deserter), "Soy un capón" (I'm a Eunuch), "Bo Cartero" (Hey, Mr. Postman; a mocking, Spanish version of "[[Please Mr. Postman]]"), "El putón del barrio" (The Biggest [[Slut]] in the Neighbourhood)  and "Me agarré el pitito con el cierre" (I Caught My [[Penis|Peepee]] in the Zipper, being said in a childish manner).

Mocking their success, they call their 1995 album ''Barranca abajo'' (Downhill), this album is acknowledged as darker than their previous works, and exploiting the success generated by ''Otra Navidad en las Trincheras'', they released in the same year, the album ''La Misma Porquería'' (The Same Rubbish), a [[Greatest hits|compilation]] of their first three albums.

=== Controversy ===
In late 1996, they released their seventh album ''El Tren Bala'' (The Bullet Train). This album was [[controversy|controversial]] in Uruguay, since one of its songs, named ''El día que Artigas se emborrachó'' (The Day Artigas Got Drunk) makes an allusion to [[José Gervasio Artigas]], the founding father of Uruguay, which led to attempts to ban the song,<ref name="History" /><ref name="Controversy">[http://www.montevideo.com.uy/notnoticias_97038_1.html El día que "El zurdo" se emborrachó] (in Spanish) retrieved June 7, 2010.</ref><ref name="Green Apple">[http://artists.letssingit.com/cuarteto-de-nos-54hvc/biography Cuarteto De Nos - Biography] (in Spanish) retrieved June 7, 2010.</ref> delaying the release of the album, being the reason of the creation of their own label, Manzana Verde (Green Apple, mocking the Beatles' Apple Records).<ref name="Green Apple" /> Because of the diversity of musical styles presented, the reception of this record was very high, becoming a [[gold record]] in a week.<ref name="Green Apple"/>

=== Decay ===
In 1998, the group signed a contract with [[Sony BMG]], and released ''Revista ¡¡Ésta!!'' (This one!! Magazine), which was received poorly, as was its next album, ''Cortamambo'' (Killjoy), released in 2000,{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} leading into a hiatus for some time while the band picked up things together from the brief disbanding that took place when Riki Musso, complaining about the sexual character of the album's cover (a woman's breasts are seen on both back and front cover) left the band for over a year.

=== Revival ===
In 2004, they released ''El Cuarteto de Nos'', a [[compilation album]] of their all-time hits played and recorded again, plus three new songs, called "Hay que comer" (We Have to Eat), "No quiero ser normal" (I Don't Want to Be Normal) and "Fui yo" (It Was Me), the album was made in a more rocker style and had a coherent production.

During 2005, they were dedicated to presenting a new album, as well as celebrating the band's 21st anniversary with a show, having as special guests the musicians [[Gabriel Peluffo]] and [[Tabaré Rivero]], amongst other famous musicians of Uruguay.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

On May 20, 2006, the album ''Raro'' (Weird) was released. It was a major commercial success, it rose to the top of the Uruguayan charts, reaching gold status only a few weeks later.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} In 2007, El Cuarteto de Nos was nominated for [[Latin Grammy]] with "Yendo a la casa de Damián" on their album ''Raro''. They started a trip around the world including stops at the [[Vive Latino|Vive Latino Festival]] in [[Mexico]], as well as the [[Rock al parque]] in [[Colombia]]. The album was truly the biggest success they had seen since ''Otra Navidad en las Trincheras'', and with the positive reviews and feedback it was safe to say they had found their new representative sound.

In 2008, they performed for [[Pepsi Music]] 2008, a huge festival in [[Argentina]], along with other big bands and solo artists.

=== Departing of Ricardo Musso and the releasing of Bipolar ===
On May 27, 2009, in the midst of the development of their album ''Bipolar'', it was said that Ricardo Musso had artistic and administrative differences with the course the band had taken. Majareta Productions announced that the band would not split, but would undergo structural change.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} With the departure of Ricardo Musso, two new musicians had joined the band, replacing Musso's guitar, [[Gustavo Antuña]] and the keyboardist [[Santiago Marrero]].
Finally, after many setbacks (such as the departure of Musso and the leaking of the album in [[Taringa!]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} when it was still in the making), the album was released in September 2009. This album was well received, winning five [[Graffiti Awards]] in June 2010.<ref name="Award">[http://www.tedelmecanico.com/2010/06/03/premios-graffiti-2010-ganadores.html Premios Graffiti 2010: Ganadores] (in Spanish) retrieved June 7, 2010.</ref>

=== Closing of the trilogy, present and future ===
When listening to ''Raro'' and ''Bipolar'' it is clear that they are similar albums in the topics they tackle, the style of the music and guitars, as well as the overall feel of the records.{{whom|date=August 2021}} This started a theory upon the release of the following album, ''Porfiado'' on 2012 that the three albums were somehow connected and made up a trilogy, after all the latter does follow that line of talking about topics such as life and its meaning, the different personalities and character traits found in people, and a diverse genre of musical rock styles. Roberto said publicly that this was not the case and that the albums were not intended to be connected, however many fans and sometimes even themselves do refer to this period of their careers as the "trilogy", since most of the songs that they play nowadays come from the three albums which gave them a setlist to go from when touring, almost completely abandoning the 10 albums that came before.

In 2014 ''Habla tu Espejo'' was released, breaking the topics of the so-called "trilogy", and being a darker album which focused on deep and sentimental topics such as stories related to Roberto's family (his mother's [[Alzheimer's]] is touched on in the song "21 de Septiembre" (September the 21st), his daughter's fears and his own fears as a parent make the lyrics of "No Llora" (She Doesn't Cry), and so on) as well as a look to themselves on songs like "Roberto" and "De Hielo", with [[poetry]] often being referenced through the grim record. It was especially well received, and the music video for "No Llora" went viral online through mid-2015. Their next album was supposed to be a [[concept album]] for different problems in modern society being perceived as [[monsters]] in a sort of [[zoo]], which resulted in the album ''Apocalipsis Zombi'', showcasing once more the clever song-writing of the band in tracks like the title number, which mocks use of social media in the modern day and repetitive musical genres, while using a beat that sounds just like a modern [[reggaeton song]]. Finally, the last album released by the quintet so far, ''Jueves'' was released without a storyline or concept, the only concept being the random nature of itself in having songs that do not relate to each other, spanning the hit tracks "Mario Neta" (Puppet displayed in a way that seems like it is a person's name), "Punta Cana" and "Contrapunto para Humano y Computadora" (Counterpoint for human and computer).
