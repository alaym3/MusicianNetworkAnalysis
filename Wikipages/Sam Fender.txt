==Career==

=== 2013–2015: Early beginnings ===
Fender began writing songs at the age of 14, being influenced by [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Jeff Buckley]], after being introduced to the albums ''[[Born to Run]]'', ''[[Darkness on the Edge of Town]]'', and [[Grace (Jeff Buckley album)|''Grace'']] by his brother.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-10-11|title=Sam Fender reacts to Bruce Springsteen comparisons|url=http://www.irishnews.com/magazine/entertainment/2019/10/11/news/sam-fender-reacts-to-bruce-springsteen-comparisons-1736978/|access-date=2021-03-27|website=The Irish News|language=en}}</ref> He started to play at his brother's open mic nights and formed his first band when he was 15.<ref name="gq-magazine.co.uk">{{Cite web|title=Sam Fender: 'The negative effects of greedy politicians have haunted the North East for years'|url=https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/sam-fender-interview|access-date=2021-03-27|website=British GQ|date=21 December 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref> In 2010, the band entered a [[Teenage Cancer Trust]] competition, where [[Matty Healy]] was a judge, and won.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Graves|first=Shahlin|date=2019-09-13|title=Interview: Sam Fender on his debut album 'Hypersonic Missiles'.|url=https://www.coupdemainmagazine.com/sam-fender/15996|access-date=2021-03-27|website=Coup De Main Magazine|language=en}}</ref> Fender acted in the 2011 pilot episode of the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] drama series [[Vera (TV series)|'' Vera'']] and a 2012 episode of the [[CBBC (TV channel)|CBBC]] fantasy series ''[[Wolfblood]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=VIDEO: Sam Fender appeared on the first episode of Vera|url=https://amp.radiox.co.uk/artists/sam-fender/video-sam-fender-killed-vera-tv-series-acting/|access-date=2021-03-27|website=amp.radiox.co.uk}}</ref> When he was about 18 he began performing paid gigs at restaurants.<ref name="gq-magazine.co.uk"/>

In 2013, Fender was spotted performing in the pub where he worked by [[Ben Howard]]'s manager Owain Davies, who took him on as a client.<ref>{{Cite web|title='It's a bit of a fairy tale': Manager Owain Davies on the incredible rise of Sam Fender|url=https://www.musicweek.com/talent/read/it-s-a-bit-of-a-fairy-tale-manager-owain-davies-on-the-incredible-rise-of-sam-fender/077566|access-date=2021-03-27|website=Musicweek.com|language=en}}</ref> Throughout 2013, Fender played a series of gigs across the country supporting a number of artists including [[Ben Howard]] and [[Willy Mason]].

Fender has said that prior to this time he tried to write songs that he thought would be popular as he was "desperate to do well" to get himself and his mother out of their financial and living situation.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-09-20|title=Fending off the demons|url=https://www.bigissuenorth.com/features/2019/09/fending-off-the-demons/|access-date=2021-03-27|website=Big Issue North|language=en-US}}</ref> However, Fender said that having a major health scare and facing the possibility of death changed his outlook on life. His recovery refocused his songwriting efforts and he began to write songs for himself. It was out of this period that Fender wrote a number of the songs he went on to release.<ref name="theguardian.com">{{Cite web|date=2019-08-03|title=Sam Fender: 'I don't want to cling on to the "class hero" thing'|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/03/sam-fender-interview-hypersonic-missiles-class-hero|access-date=2021-03-27|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref>
