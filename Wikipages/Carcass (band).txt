'''Carcass''' are an English [[extreme metal]] band from [[Liverpool]] that was formed in 1986. The band have gone through several line-up changes, leaving guitarist [[Bill Steer]] and bassist and vocalist Jeff Walker as the only constant members. They broke up in 1996,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/carcass_jeff_walker|title=Carcass' Jeff Walker|website=Exclaim.ca|date=27 August 2008|access-date=9 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://theageofmetal.com/bill-steer-of-carcass-chats-with-the-age-of-metal/|title=Bill Steer of Carcass chats with The Age of Metal|website=Theageofmetal.com|date=28 August 2013|access-date=9 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110164310/http://theageofmetal.com/bill-steer-of-carcass-chats-with-the-age-of-metal/|archive-date=10 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1477402/qa-carcass-on-surgical-steel-the-pitfalls-of-legacy-and-first-aid-kits/franchises/interview/|title=Q&A: Carcass On Surgical Steel, The Pitfalls Of Legacy, And First Aid Kits|website=Stereogum.com|date=17 September 2013|access-date=9 January 2017}}</ref> but reformed in 2007 without one of its original members, drummer [[Ken Owen]], due to health reasons.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/reunited-carcass-confirmed-for-next-year-s-wacken-open-air-festival/|title=Reunited Carcass confirmed for next year's Wacken Open Air|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=6 October 2007|access-date=6 October 2007}}</ref> To date, the band have released seven studio albums, two compilation albums, four EPs, two demo albums, one video album, and six music videos.

==History==
===Early days (1985–1989)===
[[Image:Carcass 30.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jeff Walker at [[Gods of Metal#2008|Gods of Metal]], Bologna, Italy (2008)]]

Carcass were first formed as a school band by Bill Steer and Ken Owen that soon after disbanded.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.collideartandculture.com/#!Interview-Bill-Steer-of-Carcass/c1lt4/55251a980cf215f35a4bc3c2|title=Interview: Bill Steer of Carcass|last=Lennon|first=Andi|date=8 April 2015|website=Collide Art & Culture Mag|access-date=3 March 2016}}</ref> Steer then joined the [[D-beat]] band Disattack with drummer Middie, Paul on bass and Pek on vocals.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url = http://www.stereogum.com/1424501/premature-evaluation-carcass-surgical-steel/franchises/premature-evaluation/|title = Premature Evaluation: Carcass Surgical Steel|last = Nelson|first = Michael|date = 2 August 2013|website = Stereogum|access-date = 3 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://toughriffs.weebly.com/interviews/interview-with-carlo-regadas-devoid|title=Interview with Carlo Regadas, Devoid|website=Toughriffs.weebly.com|access-date=3 March 2016}}</ref> After releasing a four track demo entitled ''A Bomb Drops ...'' in 1986,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://demoarchives.com/Bands/Disattack-Eng/disattack.asp|title=Disattack - The Bomb Drops demo listing.|website=Demoarchives.com|access-date=3 March 2016}}</ref> the bass player left the band and was replaced by Jeff Walker, formerly guitarist and vocalist of the [[Electro Hippies]]. Vocalist Andrew Pek changed his name to Sanjiv after a visit to India.<ref name=":0" /> At about the same time, Bill Steer joined [[Napalm Death]] (replacing [[Justin Broadrick]]) and recorded the second side of what became Napalm Death's first album, ''[[Scum (Napalm Death album)|Scum]]''. Walker also designed the cover art for ''Scum''.

Disattack then changed its name to Carcass as the group changed musical direction. This led to a change in drummer and saw Ken Owen join the band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.earache.com/bands/carcass/news_archive/carcass.html|title=Carcass: The First Interview in Five Years|date=30 May 2005|website=Earache.com|access-date=3 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923232451/http://www.earache.com/bands/carcass/news_archive/carcass.html#|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> In April 1987, they recorded the ''Flesh Ripping Sonic Torment'' demo, the only Carcass recording featuring vocalist Sanjiv, who left shortly after. Walker, Steer and Owen shared vocal duties for the debut album, which was done in only four days. Despite the primitive production values of Carcass's debut ''[[Reek of Putrefaction]]'' (1988), with which the band was very displeased,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goddamnbastard.org/carcass/interviews/rockhard40.html|title=Carcass - Perverted Sickos|date=June 1990|publisher=Rock Hard|access-date=30 April 2008}}</ref> it became a favourite of [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] DJ [[John Peel]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Mudrian |first=Albert |title=[[Choosing Death: The Improbable History of Death Metal and Grindcore]] |year=2004 |publisher=Feral House |location=Los Angeles, CA |page=132}}</ref> Due to his interest, they were asked to participate in their first [[List of Peel sessions#C|Peel Session]] in 1989, where they debuted new material for their second album. The Peel Session was released as an EP with the band members adopting [[pseudonyms]]: K. Grumegargler, J. Offalmangler, and W.G. Thorax Embalmer. Also that year, Steer and Walker appeared as members of Lister's fictional band ''Smeg and the Heads'' in an episode of [[Red Dwarf]].<ref name="Pathologist's Report">Carcass - The Pathologist's Report documentary</ref>

===Progress (1989–1993)===
[[Image:Bill Steer.jpg|thumb|upright|Bill Steer at Gods of Metal, Bologna, Italy (2008)]]

''[[Symphonies of Sickness]]'' (1989), the second album, which contained a much improved production quality (courtesy of Colin Richardson), featured more [[death metal]] structures and longer songs with more slow passages.<ref name=Purcell>{{cite book|last=J. Purcell|first=Natalie|title=Death Metal Music: The Passion and Politics of a Subculture|date=5 May 2003|isbn=0-7864-1585-1|pages=21–22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AwJJR5vvlIsC&q=Choosing+Death:+The+Improbable+History+of+Death+Metal+%26+Grindcore+Carcass|editor=McFarland|access-date=18 December 2011|quote=Carcass' following album, ''Symphonies of Sickness'', featured slower and catchier songs, and showed the band's movement into the Death Metal genre. The next album, ''Necroticism: Descanting the Insalubrious'', was pure Death Metal with intricate dynamics, complex structured songs, and refined guitar solos.}}</ref> The second half of the tour in support of ''Symphonies of Sickness'' saw the addition of second lead guitarist [[Michael Amott]], whose previous work included [[Carnage (band)|Carnage]]. Amott was to become a permanent member, playing on the second Peel Session and contributing material towards their third album.

''[[Necroticism – Descanting the Insalubrious]]'' (1991) showed even more intricate composition, further improved production and guitar solos.<ref name=Purcell/> Despite the addition of Amott to the ranks, Steer still handled all rhythm guitar duties, with Amott only contributing leads and one riff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/carcass-giving-people-what-they-want/|title=Carcass Giving People What They Want|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=18 September 2013|access-date=18 October 2013}}</ref> Carcass again supported the album with heavy touring, and were part of the Earache 'Gods of Grind' tour with [[Cathedral (band)|Cathedral]], [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]] and [[Confessor (band)|Confessor]] in both Europe and the United States. The ''[[Tools of the Trade]]'' EP was released in 1992 to coincide with the "Gods of Grind" tour.

===Columbia (1993–1995)===
[[Image:Michael Ammot.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Michael Amott at Gods of Metal, Bologna, Italy (2008)]]

The band's fourth album, ''[[Heartwork]]'', was released in the UK in October 1993,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Carcass-Heartwork/release/3670209|title=Carcass - Heartwork (1993, CD)|website=[[Discogs]]|access-date=4 November 2020}}</ref> and did not have a US release until three months later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Carcass-Heartwork/release/7488238|title=Carcass - Heartwork (1994, CD)|website=[[Discogs]]|access-date=4 November 2020}}</ref> It was considered a radical change by many fans,<ref>{{cite web|last=Franklin|first=Dan|title=Can You Feel The Forceps: Carcass, Surgical Steel And Heartwork Revisited|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/13361-carcass-surgical-steel-review|publisher=[[The Quietus]]|access-date=19 October 2013|date=16 September 2013}}</ref> which eliminated Steer's deeper vocals and the clinically gory lyrics. Again, Steer handled all rhythm guitar duties, this time due to Amott losing his passport in Israel (thus making him unable to return to England in time to record).<ref name="Pathologist's Report"/> Song structures, whilst still containing musically complex parts, were simpler, in some cases using the verse/chorus/verse formula.

After the release of ''Heartwork'', Carcass signed a worldwide deal with [[Columbia Records]], who hoped for commercial success, even suggesting that Jeff Walker learn how to sing. Michael Amott left the band right after ''Heartwork'' was recorded, and was for a while replaced by Mike Hickey, who was later replaced by Carlo Regadas.

During the summer of 1994, Walker remixed the track "Inside Out" for a [[Die Krupps]] remix album, although the version stayed fairly true to the original with the exception of Owen's drum samples from ''Heartwork'' replacing the Die Krupps original, and additional mixing from Walker and Colin Richardson at Parr Street studios (where ''Heartwork'' was recorded).<ref>{{cite web |title=Die Krupps – The Final Remixes (1994, CD) |url=https://www.discogs.com/release/4298830-Die-Krupps-The-Final-Remixes |website=Discogs |access-date=10 October 2021 |language=en}}</ref>

Carcass now set about writing songs for their major label debut. During the December 1994 UK tour Carcass showcased two songs from their current writing sessions – "Edge of Darkness" and "Firmhand", both showing a more straight forward song writing approach than on previous efforts.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Around this time, "Edge of Darkness" was recorded for the BBC Radio 1 Rock Show sessions – a session which could be found on later compilation albums.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

By late 1994, 17 songs were ready, and the band set about using their $200,000 advance to record the album, again with Colin Richardson, at Rockfield studios in [[Monmouth]], [[South Wales]] in early 1995. During the 6-week recording schedule, the record label began to withdraw support, stating that Carcass were not ready to record, and needed to write more songs. This advice was ignored, as was the suggestion to have [[Terry Date]] remix the album, and the band continued. At the time, Jeff Walker stated in an interview with the UK's [[Metal Hammer Magazine]] that the album was taking more of a classic rock approach, with drums, bass and twin guitars à la Thin Lizzy, in comparison to earlier "multi-layered guitar" productions. This has since been put down to Bill Steer's unwillingness to perform the time-consuming guitar layering (as once again Steer performed all rhythm guitar) through losing interest in the metal genre.

During the ''Swansong'' recording sessions, Carcass were asked to remix a [[Björk]] track - "[[Isobel (song)|Isobel]]". This was not a remix as such but more of a re-recording with only Björk's vocals remaining. The track saw the light of day in March 1996 on Björk's "[[Hyperballad]]" single.

===Demise (1996–2006)===
Continuing record company problems with Columbia/Sony caused the album to be delayed from late summer 1995 to June 1996, in which time Carcass moved back to [[Earache Records]], and broke up before even releasing ''[[Swansong (album)|Swansong]]''. The move back to Earache was dubbed by Walker as "the second great rock and roll swindle"<ref>''[[Kerrang!]]'', June 1996</ref> as they had effectively been paid twice for the same album. ''Swansong'' featured twelve of the seventeen tracks put to tape during the recording sessions. Walker has since stated in interviews that all seventeen songs should have been included in a double album, and that some songs omitted from ''Swansong'' were actually stronger than some of ''Swansong''{{'}}s actual content. Carcass also remixed [[Killing Joke]]'s "Democracy" (by re-recording the music, but keeping the original vocals), although this time Regadas performed all guitar duties, as it is thought Steer had quit the band by early 1996. The Carcass "Rooster Mix" was made available on Killing Joke's ''[[Democracy (album)|Democracy]]''. Around the time of ''Swansong'''s release, Carcass informed the press that they were ending the band without even a farewell tour, but most fans had guessed this may be the case via the album title.

The album sold well, staying near the top of the Indie Rock Chart in the UK for several months, above bands such as [[Placebo (band)|Placebo]], despite having no touring support from the band. It is rumoured that the band were offered several lucrative tours in 1995, such as supporting [[Iron Maiden]] on their "X-Factour 95" tour, which had the album been released as expected in 1995, could have improved the band's sales and longevity.

A posthumous compilation, ''[[Wake up and Smell the... Carcass]]'' was released in October 1996 to collect together Carcass' rarer material, including unreleased material, songs only available on EPs and compilations, and live tracks. An accompanying video was released a few weeks after the ''Wake Up'' CD with little knowledge from the band or their management. The video, later released on DVD, featured five of the band's promotional videos, a show from the Grindcrusher 1989 tour (as a three piece) and a show from the 1992 Gods of Grind tour. Sound on the two live shows is poor, particularly the latter, which Walker has described as "unmixed".

Owen, Walker, and Regadas continued with the band [[Blackstar (band)|Blackstar]], accompanied by former Cathedral bassist Mark Griffiths, using the second ''Swansong'' advance from Earache to fund the recording. Blackstar, later Blackstar Rising, became defunct after drummer Owen suffered a severe [[cerebral hemorrhage]]. Amott went on to found [[hard rock]] band [[Spiritual Beggars]] and successful Swedish melodic death metal band [[Arch Enemy (band)|Arch Enemy]]. In the biggest musical departure, Steer formed [[Firebird (band)|Firebird]], a [[Eric Clapton|Clapton]]-esque rock band.

===Reformation (2007–2012)===
In June 2006, in an interview with Walker, he discussed the possibility of reforming Carcass, but mentioned that it was unlikely that Owen would participate, since he could not replicate his former drumming proficiency due to the effects of the cerebral hemorrhage he suffered in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lordsofmetal.nl/showinterview.php?id=1376&lang=en|title=Archive|publisher=Lordsofmetal.nl|access-date=30 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606090953/http://www.lordsofmetal.nl/showinterview.php?id=1376&lang=en|archive-date=6 June 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> In September 2007, Michael Amott announced that he was rehearsing with Bill Steer, Jeff Walker and [[Daniel Erlandsson]] (replacing Ken Owen) in secret to rehearse old Carcass songs for a possible reunion tour. The original plans were to play at several festivals during the summer, but they couldn't meet the deadlines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/mike-amott-carcass-has-rehearsed-and-may-reunite-for-tour/|title=MIKE AMOTT: CARCASS Has Rehearsed And May Reunite For Tour|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=18 September 2007|access-date=18 October 2013}}</ref>

In October 2007, Carcass were confirmed to play at German heavy metal festival [[Wacken Open Air]] and Finland's [[Tuska Open Air Metal Festival]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wacken.com/en/woa2010/main-news/news/archiv/archiv-single/article/sensation-carcass-is-back/|title=Sensation : CARCASS is back!!|website=Wacken.com|access-date=30 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930101412/http://www.wacken.com/en/woa2010/main-news/news/archiv/archiv-single/article/sensation-carcass-is-back/|archive-date=30 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Carcass later embarked on a reunion tour, beginning on 6 June 2008 at the Sweden Rock Festival in Norje, Sweden. Carcass also played at [[Hellfest Summer Open Air]], [[Metalcamp]] and several other festivals. The band toured Australia and New Zealand in 2008, and then in North America during September and October 2008, followed by the band's first South American tour, playing in Colombia, Chile, Argentina and Brazil. On 15 November 2008, Carcass headlined the Danish Metal Awards held in Amager Bio, Copenhagen, Denmark. Steer also presented the award for Best Danish Debut Album, which went to SCAMP for ''Mirror Faced Mentality''. Carcass surprised the audience by bringing Ken Owen to the stage where he gave a brief drum solo to show how far he had come in recovering from his illness. Carcass performed an exclusive UK show at the [[Damnation Festival]] in Leeds. It was the first time Carcass had played in England in 14 years.

Carcass re-released their entire back catalogue with bonus material during 2008 on Earache Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://askearache.blogspot.com/2008/03/carcass-5-dvd-documentaries-coming-up.html|title=ASK EARACHE: CARCASS- 5 DVD documentaries coming up soon|website=Askearache.blogspot.com|access-date=30 January 2011}}</ref> When asked if the band were planning on writing and recording a new album, Steer replied:

{{quote|I would be very surprised if that would really happen. But never say never, I'm always the last one who needs to be convinced. Michael and Jeff are much more busy with those things than I am.

Carcass continued to play live in 2009, with a North American tour completed in March 2009. Carcass also headlined the [[Bloodstock Open Air]] in [[Derbyshire, England]] in August 2009.

===''Surgical Steel'' (2012–2019)===
Steer and Walker started talking about recording a new album after the reunion shows were done. They wrote some songs to see how they would turn out. According to Steer, "If it sounded like Carcass to us, we were going to proceed.

In a June 2014 interview with Metal Underground, Walker was asked if Carcass were going to make a follow-up to ''Surgical Steel''. He replied, "Ultimately, as long as we feel we got somewhere to go then we would create new material. We are not just going to do it just for the sake of it. We have to feel inspired. All I can say is I do see somewhere where we can take Carcass if we choose to do another album and personally I do want to do another album. I'm not completely satisfied with any album we've made so far. I don't think we've made the classic Carcass album, that's the way I feel."<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview With Carcass' Jeff Walker|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=103850|publisher=Metal Underground|date=22 June 2014|access-date=20 July 2014}}</ref>

Carcass released an EP titled ''[[Surgical Remission/Surplus Steel]]'' in November 2014. The EP is a collection of unreleased tracks recorded during the ''Surgical Steel'' sessions and it is released on physical and digital formats. "Well, let's call this tying up loose ends," commented Walker. "We thought we'd make all the tracks available from the ''Surgical Steel'' album session on an EP… just in case you bought the jewel case version, didn't buy the digipak, didn't buy the Japanese import, or maybe you never bought the [[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel magazine]] issue with the flexi disc? Well, here you go; ALL the songs on one disc along with a previously unreleased track. Even [[The Black Dahlia Murder (band)|Trevor Strnad's]] arm makes a guest appearance!

The new EP includes the previously released digital single "Under the Scalpel Blade". Walker commented: "Well, the COVID situation has put the release of the new Carcass album on the backburner for the time being. Given that we said there'd be new music in August, we thought it would be cool to have a stop-gap release and let you hear some of the tracks that never quite made the cut.
