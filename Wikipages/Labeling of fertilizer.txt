Many countries have standardized the '''labeling of fertilizers''' to indicate their contents of major nutrients.<ref name="Voluntary Standards for the Fertilizer and Supplements Industry">{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=cache:3KO6Nxn96cMJ:cfpf-fcpf.ca/files/PDF/Monachus_presentation.ppt+labeling+of+fertilizer+norway&hl=en&gl=us|title=Voluntary Standards for the Fertilizer and Supplements Industry |last=Chambers  |first=Albert|author2=Sally Rutherford |date=27 November 2007|accessdate=3 February 2010}}</ref><ref name="Draft Code">{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:CgW191hwEBIJ:www.fifa.asn.au/files/pdf/regulation/Draft%2520Code%2520of%2520Practice%2520for%2520Fertilizer%2520Description%2520%26%2520Labelling.pdf+labeling+of+fertilizer&hl=en&gl=us&sig=AHIEtbSJjp1liw8XbwDLtw2aqua-xK0n1g|title=Draft Code of Practice for Fertilier Description and Labeling|date=15 September 2008|publisher=Fertilizer Industry Federation Association (FIFA)|accessdate=3 February 2010}}</ref> The most common labeling convention, the '''NPK''' or '''N-P-K label''', shows the amounts of the [[chemical elements]] [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], and [[potassium]].

==Common labeling conventions==

===The NPK analysis label===

Fertilizers are usually labeled with three numbers, as in 18-20-10, indicating the relative content of the [[macronutrients]] nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), respectively.

More precisely, the first number ("N value") is the percentage of elemental nitrogen by weight in the fertilizer; that is, the [[mass fraction (chemistry)|mass fraction]] of nitrogen times 100.  The second number ("P value") is the percentage by weight of [[phosphorus pentoxide]] {{chem|P|2|O|5}} in a fertilizer with the same amount of phosphorus that gets all of its phosphorus from P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>.  The third number ("K value") is analogous, based on the equivalent content of [[potassium oxide]] {{chem|K|2|O}}.<ref>[http://www.flairform.com/hints/nutrient_analysis.htm] 22 October 2014</ref>

For example, a 15-13-20 fertilizer would contain 15% by weight of nitrogen, and the same amounts of phosphorus and potassium as a mixture of 13% by weight of {{chem|P|2|O|5}}, 20% {{chem|K|2|O}}, and 52% of some inert ingredient.

===Other labeling conventions===
In the [[U.K.]], fertilizer labeling regulations allow for reporting the elemental mass fractions of phosphorus and potassium. The regulations stipulate that this should be done in parentheses after the standard N-P-K values, as in "15-30-15
(15-13-13)".<ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1990/Uksi_19900887_en_4.htm UK Fertilizers Regulations 1990, Schedule 2] Part 1, Para. 7.</ref>

In Australia, macronutrient fertilizers are labeled with an "N-P-K-S" system, which uses elemental mass fractions rather than the standard N-P-K values and includes the amount of sulfur (S) contained in the fertilizer.

==Converting nutrient analysis to composition==

The values in an NPK fertilizer label are related to the concentrations (by weight) of phosphorus and potassium elements as follows:

* {{chem|P|2|O|5}} consists of 56.4% elemental oxygen and 43.6% elemental phosphorus by weight. Therefore, the elemental phosphorus percentage of a fertilizer is 0.436 times its P value.
* {{chem|K|2|O}} consists of 17% oxygen and 83% elemental potassium by weight. Therefore, the elemental potassium percentage is 0.83 times the K value.

The N value in NPK labels represents actual percentage of nitrogen element by weight, so it does not need to be converted.

So, for example, an 18−51−20 fertilizer contains by weight
*18% elemental nitrogen,
*0.436 × 51 = 22% elemental phosphorus, and
*0.83 × 20 = 17% elemental potassium.

As another example, the fertilizer ''[[sylvite]]'' is a naturally occurring mineral consisting mostly of [[potassium chloride]], KCl.  Pure potassium chloride contains one potassium atom (whose [[atomic mass]] is 39.09 [[gram|g]]/[[Mole (unit)|mol]]) for every chlorine atom (whose atomic mass is 35.45 g/mol).  Therefore, pure KCl is 39.09/(39.09 + 35.45) = 52% potassium and 48% chlorine by weight.  Its K value is therefore 52/0.83 = 63; that is, a fertilizer that gets all its potassium from {{chem|K|2|O}} and has the same potassium contents as pure KCl would have to be 63% {{chem|K|2|O}}.  Pure KCl fertilizer would thus be labeled 0-0-63.  Since sylvite contains other compounds that contribute no N, P, or K, it is usually labeled 0-0-60.
