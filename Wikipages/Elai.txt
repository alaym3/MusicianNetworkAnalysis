'''Elai''' ({{zh|c=恶来}}, ''Èlái'') was a bodyguard for [[King Zhou of Shang|King Zhou]] during the [[Shang Dynasty]] of ancient China. He was an ancestor of [[Feizi]], the founder of the [[state of Qin]]. His brother [[Jisheng]] ([[:zh:季勝|季勝]]) was an ancestor of [[Zaofu]], the founder of the [[state of Zhao]]. According to the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (''Shiji'') by [[Sima Qian]], Elai was known for his immense physical strength.

In the historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' by [[Luo Guanzhong]], [[Cao Cao]], impressed with [[Dian Wei]]'s strength, states "This is old Elai again." Thus this fictional nickname of Dian Wei stuck with him, and he was henceforth known as "Elai" Dian Wei.
