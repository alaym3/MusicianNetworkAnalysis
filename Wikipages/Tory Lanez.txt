In 2006, he was sent to live with his cousin Dahir Abib, Orane Forrest, in Jamaica, Queens, New York because of his behavior issues. Daystar then was forced to move to Toronto with his grandmother. Since she refused to take care of him, he was on his own at the age of 15. "I ended up moving downtown with these three dudes that I didn't really know. I came into the house and I didn't realize how things worked. From like fifteen to eighteen, I was just fighting them. It was every man for himself. That's what made me a man, having to fend for myself and being in a situation where there is no dad, no grandma and no mom to help you. It changed the person that I am today", he says.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/01/tory-lanez-show-and-prove-xxl-magazine-winter-2015-issue/|title=Tory Lanez Can't Be Stopped in 2016|last=Johnson|first=Miranda|date=January 11, 2016|website=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|access-date=April 10, 2016}}</ref> He then once again started rapping, before giving himself a nickname, Notorious (which is a reference to the late rapper [[Notorious B.I.G.]], whom he idolized), and adopted into his new moniker "Tory Lanez". At the age of 16, Daystar dropped out of the tenth grade, and he would begin performing songs at the outdoor concerts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greenmountainhiphop.com/tag/sean-kingston/|title=Sean Kingston &#124; Green Mountain Hip-Hop|date=March 20, 2012|access-date=July 14, 2015|author=Stevie Beats}}</ref> At the age of 17, Daystar began singing, which he found an interest in.

'''One Umbrella''' is a Canadian record label and management company founded by Tory Lanez in 2014.

== Musical style ==
In an interview on Nice Kicks with Ian Stonebook, Lanez described his own personal style he calls, Swavey: "Swavey is a two-adjective word. A lot of people use it as an attribute, but the real definition of swavey is a genre of music. The genre of music is the genre of fusing more than one together. I know it sounds strange, but if you ask an artist what they do they're going to say that they rap, they sing, they do rock, a lot of people are multi-talented. They get looked at confused, but I don't think that they're confused. I feel that they're just talented, swavey artists. Labels want to put you in one lane, but I feel like there are so many people are more than that and they're swavey artists."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nicekicks.com/2012/10/14/tory-lanez-talks-air-jordans-music-industry-advice-staying-swavey/|title=Tory Lanez Talks Air Jordans, Music Industry Advice & Staying Swavey &#124; Nice Kicks|date=October 14, 2012|access-date=July 7, 2015|author=Stonebook, Ian}}</ref>

== Controversies ==

===Drake===
In 2010, Lanez posted a video on YouTube, challenging fellow Canadian rapper [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], to whom he was rumored to be related. The video features him denying these rumors and announcing the $10,000 challenge. While showing Drake respect, Lanez again challenged him, but only if Drake would listen to some of his tracks from his second mixtape ''Playing for Keeps''. Lanez also claimed that if Drake did not like it, he would personally give to him $10,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://torylanez.wordpress.com/about/|title=Biography The Official Tory Lanez Fansite|access-date=December 3, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://drizzy.ning.com/m/discussion?id=3514281%3ATopic%3A110007|title=Tory Lanez $10,000 Challenge To Drake (Who Do Ya'll Think?)|date=March 27, 2010|author=Kevin G|access-date=June 3, 2015}}</ref> In August 2015, while appearing on the "Sway in the Morning" radio show on [[Shade 45]], Lanez had taken a shot at Drake, alluding to the infamous freestyle he had performed on [[Hot 97]] six years prior where he had read lyrics from his [[BlackBerry]]. In October 2015, Lanez created additional tension with the rapper when he expressed his dislike of the use of "the 6", a nickname for Toronto, and one that had, of course, been popularized by Drake.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rapdose.com/2015/10/12/tory-lanez-disses-drake-says-its-not-cool-to-call-toronto-the-6/|title=Tory Lanez Disses Drake, Says It's Not Cool To Call Toronto "The 6"|website=Rapdose.com|access-date=April 25, 2016}}</ref>

In the lyrics of his 2016 single "[[Summer Sixteen]]", Drake appears to make a subliminal diss at Lanez, rapping: "All you boys in the new Toronto want to be me a little." Many took this, and the ensuing lines, to be something off a shot taken towards Lanez. Drake also took aim at [[Meek Mill]] who, in the midst of their ongoing feud, criticised Drake for dissing Lanez on the song, "[[War Pain]]": "Tory from the 6, you hatin' on him, Lord knows!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/drake-goes-after-meek-mill-barack-obama-and-tory-lanez-on-summer-sixteen-news.19888.html|title=Drake Goes After Meek Mill, Barack Obama & Tory Lanez On "Summer Sixteen"|website=HotNewHipHop|access-date=March 12, 2016}}</ref> In an interview with [[Revolt (TV network)|Revolt]], Lanez was asked about the perceived shot. He was skeptical about whether it was aimed at him at all, he assured the press that he would not be responding even if it was: "Drake could diss me 20,000 times, and I'd never diss him. I'm a fan... I have no negativity on my side. All blessings to that man."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/tory-lanez-on-drake-id-never-diss-him-im-a-fan-news.20159.html|title=Tory Lanez On Drake: "I'd Never Diss Him – I'm A Fan"|website=HotNewHipHop|access-date=March 12, 2016}}</ref> When Lanez released his version of, "[[Uber Everywhere]]", he raps, "Pussy boy, smack that smile clean off your face / You don't know no trap niggas, you don't be around this way / You some actor nigga boy, I used to see you on the screen". Many people thought Lanez was taking shots at Drake. Lanez dissed Drake again in the song, "Line Up the Flex" with ASAP Ferg. Lanez rapped "I was never gang, gang, gang, gang/ I was One Umbrella Mob", in a response to Drake's shot at him on "Summer Sixteen".<ref name=":0" />

Drake fired back in the song "Still Here" on the album [[Views (album)|''Views'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/04/drake-views-from-the-6-album-subliminal-shots/|title=10 Subliminal Shots on Drake's 'Views' Album – XXL|website=XXL Mag|access-date=May 17, 2016}}</ref> In an interview with [[Zane Lowe]] on [[Beats 1]], Drake spoke on Lanez: "I encourage anybody to go out there and do the most damage that you possibly can. Do you things. Get all the fruits. Get everything. Become the biggest artist you can possibly be. Just don't get up there finally and start talking down on me, especially when we have no interaction."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.designntrend.com/articles/75288/20160502/drake-talks-torey-lanez-beef-blasts-young-rappper-trying-diss.htm|title=Drake Talks Torey Lanez Beef, Blasts Young Rapper For Trying To Diss Him|last=Nelson|first=Daryl|date=May 2, 2016|website=Design & Trend|access-date=May 16, 2016}}</ref> Lanez took shots at Drake again in the song, "For Real".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/new-music/2016/05/tory-lanez-drake-shots-for-real/|title=Tory Lanez Baits Drake Once More With Shots on 'For Real'|last=Ivey|first=Justin|date=May 6, 2016|website=XXL|access-date=May 16, 2016}}</ref> On June 27, 2016, Lanez talked to Ebro on the Ebro in the Morning show and he stated about Drake, and said "Hip-hop is a contact sport, I'm here to compete, I'm here to be #1." He went on to say, "I was a fan of his music before, no one's ever took that from me. That doesn't mean I'm not here to take my crown."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/tory-lanez-on-drake-we-cant-share-first-place-news.22509.html?|title=Ready to take crown|last=Lilah|first=Rose|date=June 27, 2016|website=Hotnewhiphop|access-date=June 27, 2016}}</ref>

===Jacquees===
In February 2016, [[Jacquees]] tweeted, "[[Chris Brown|Chris [Brown]]] my idol/big bro he don't count never will but you other guys im at yo throat #FuckHowYouFeel". The tweet meant that Jacquees is in a fierce competition with every [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] artist in the game, except for [[Chris Brown]], who he says is his idol. The tweet was not convincing to Lanez, who responded to Jacquees with two choice emojis. Jacquees took Lanez's emoji response as an assault, and he went on to call Lanez a "peasant" and "watermelon head ass". Jacquees did, however, take the time to compliment Lanez's penmanship, though he implied that Lanez's vocal talents are not up to par with his own. Lanez did not respond to Jacquees, but told his fans to "advise that boy".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/jacquees-challenges-randb-competition-tory-lanez-responds-news.20366.html|title=Jacquees Challenges R&B Competition, Tory Lanez Responds|website=HotNewHipHop|access-date=March 12, 2016}}</ref> The two later ended their rivalry at [[South by Southwest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/tory-lanez-and-jacquees-have-squashed-their-beef-news.20683.html|title=Tory Lanez & Jacquees Have Squashed Their Beef|website=HotNewHipHop|access-date=March 20, 2016}}</ref> They later announced in August 2016 that they were going on tour together.

=== Joyner Lucas ===
In November 2018, during an [[Instagram]] Live session, Lanez claimed that he's a better rapper than American rapper [[Joyner Lucas]].<ref name="Jahmal">{{cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/tory-lanez-is-resurrecting-friendly-competition-in-hip-hop-news.70768.html|title=Tory Lanez Is Resurrecting Friendly Competition in Hip-Hop|last=Jahmal|first=Karlton|date=n.d.|website=HotNewHipHop|access-date=July 12, 2019}}</ref> In response, Lucas challenged Lanez to a [[Battle rap|rap battle]], which led to several diss records being released between the two, including the "[[Lucky You (song)|Lucky You]] Freestyle" and the "[[Zeze (song)|Zeze]] Freestyle".<ref name="Jahmal"/> Although the beef was short-lived, Lanez expressed distaste at those who sided with Lucas.<ref name="Jahmal"/> The end of the beef was once more evident when the two released a remix of [[DaBaby]]'s song "[[Suge (DaBaby song)|Suge]]".

=== Don Q ===
Shortly after his beef with Joyner Lucas ensued, New York rapper [[Don Q (rapper)|Don Q]] dropped a battle track titled "I'm Not Joyner", alleging that Lanez was stealing Q's lyrics.<ref name="Jahmal"/> Lanez fired back with a track called "Dom Queen", before Q responded with another diss track.<ref name="Jahmal"/> Another rapper, [[Dreamville Records|Dreamville]] artist [[JID]] was involved in the beef, seemingly displeased with previous statements Lanez took aim at his mentor, [[J. Cole]].<ref name="Jahmal"/> Lanez then challenged the entire Dreamville artist roster in response, with rappers including DreamDoll responding with their own tracks aimed at Lanez.<ref name="Jahmal"/>

=== Response ===
In response to Lanez's various rap beefs, Karlton Jahmal of hip hop publication ''HotNewHipHop'' said "the art of the competitive, lyrical battle rap has been missing from the mainstream wave for years...", until Lanez brought the culture exactly what it has been missing with his friendly yet competitive take. Jahmal concluded that Lanez was essentially "engineering an overall shift back to the roots of hip-hop [...] more about proving lyrical talent than they are about utterly destroying an opponent".<ref name="Jahmal" />

==Legal issues==
On March 26, 2016, during a concert in [[Midland, Texas]], violent scuffles between security forces and concertgoers occurred. Lanez then proceeded to tell the crowd to "fuck shit up," which incited a full-on riot and forced police to shut down the show. Multiple people were arrested. The venue and concert promoters considered legal actions against Lanez.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.38087/title.tory-lanez-incites-riot-cops-shut-down-texas-concert|title=Tory Lanez Incites Riot & Cops Shut Down Texas Concert|last=Hernandez|first=Victoria|date=March 28, 2016|website=[[HipHopDX]]|access-date=April 9, 2016}}</ref>

===2020 shooting allegations and charges===
[[File:Megan Thee Stallion 2019 2.jpg|thumb|210x210px|[[Megan Thee Stallion]], who accused Lanez of shooting her, pictured in 2019]]
On July 12, 2020, after leaving a house party where there had been an argument that resulted in violence, Lanez was arrested in the [[Hollywood Hills]] and charged with [[carrying a concealed weapon]] in his vehicle. Another rap artist, [[Megan Thee Stallion]], was also in the car, and was initially reported to have had a foot wound caused by glass.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2020/music/news/tory-lanez-arrested-concealed-weapon-megan-thee-stallion-1234705605/|title=Rapper Tory Lanez Arrested After Police Find Concealed Weapon in Vehicle|last=Tangcay|first=Jazz|date=July 13, 2020|website=Variety|access-date=July 14, 2020}}</ref> However, in an Instagram post, Megan later disputed this, stating she underwent surgery after suffering "gunshot wounds, as a result of a crime that was committed against me and done with the intention to physically harm me". At the time, she did not state who shot her.<ref>{{Cite web|date=July 15, 2020|title=Megan Thee Stallion Says She's 'Incredibly Grateful to Be Alive' After Being Shot Multiple Times|url=http://www.billboard.com/amp/articles/columns/hip-hop/9418870/megan-thee-stallion-shot-multiple-times|access-date=July 15, 2020|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> On [[Instagram Live]] in August 2020, Megan stated that she was shot by Lanez during this incident. She also voiced her opinions against his publicist team, saying: "You shot me, and you got your publicist and your people going to these blogs lyin' and shit. Stop lyin'. Why lie?"<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bloom|first=Madison|date=August 21, 2020|title=Megan Thee Stallion Says Tory Lanez Shot Her|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/megan-thee-stallion-says-tory-lanez-shot-her/|access-date=August 21, 2020|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]}}</ref>

On September 25, 2020, Lanez released his fifth album, ''Daystar'', in which he addresses the shooting on nearly every song, and denies that he shot Megan, while also claiming she and her team were "trying to frame" him; on the song "Money Over Fallouts", he raps: "how you get shot in your foot, don't hit no bones or tendons".<ref name="Defensive"/> The same day, in a statement to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Megan's attorney, Alex Spiro, claimed Lanez's representatives had since attempted to launch a "smear campaign" against Megan to discredit her allegations. Spiro stated: "We have been made aware of manipulated text messages and invented email accounts that have been disseminated to the media in a calculated attempt to peddle a false narrative about the events that occurred".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/music/megan-thee-stallion-lawyer-tory-lanez-smear-campaign-shooting-allegations-2762581%3famp|title=Megan Thee Stallion's lawyer claims Tory Lanez's team launched "smear campaign" over shooting allegations|work=[[NME]]|last=Daly|first=Rhian|date=September 25, 2020|access-date=October 1, 2020}}</ref> Lanez's team denied this, saying that they would investigate who was behind the fake emails and will take appropriate action.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/amp/articles/columns/hip-hop/9456067/tory-lanez-megan-thee-stallion-300-entertainment-emails|title=Tory Lanez's Team Allegedly Sent Emails From Fake 300 Entertainment Account to 'Campaign Press' for Megan Thee Stallion Incident (Exclusive)|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=Lamarre|first=Carl|date=September 29, 2020|access-date=October 1, 2020}}</ref>

On September 29, 2020, following negative responses to Lanez from certain publications, the rapper claimed on Instagram that news sites had launched a smear campaign against him, stating that he has "never seen verified publications ... come together with 'biased' opinions for a smear campaign on an artist", and questioning who is "paying" them.<ref name="Marie">{{cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/tory-lanez-accuses-news-sites-of-being-paid-off-for-smear-campaign-news.118747.html%3f_amp|title=Tory Lanez Accuses News Sites Of Being Paid Off For "Smear Campaign"|work=HotNewHipHop|last=Marie|first=Erika|date=September 29, 2020|access-date=October 1, 2020}}</ref> In October 2020, Lanez was officially charged with felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, personal use of a firearm, and carrying a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://variety.com/2020/music/news/tory-lanez-charged-with-assault-megan-thee-stallion-shooting-1234798134/|title= Tory Lanez Charged With Assault in Megan Thee Stallion Shooting|work=Variety|publisher=Penske Business Media, LLC|date=October 8, 2020}}</ref> He also faces an allegation that he personally inflicted great bodily injury with a gun.

A protective order has since been issued against Lanez; he is to stay at least 100 yards away from Megan and not contact her. He was also ordered to surrender any guns he owns.<ref name="Away">{{cite web|url=https://www.rap-up.com/2020/10/13/tory-lanez-protective-order-megan-thee-stallion/amp/|title=Tory Lanez Ordered to Stay Away From Megan Thee Stallion|work=[[Rap-Up]]|date=October 13, 2020|access-date=October 14, 2020}}</ref> In an [[op-ed]] for ''[[The New York Times]]'', published on October 13, 2020, Megan addressed the shooting further, writing: "Black women are still constantly disrespected and disregarded in so many areas of life. I was recently the victim of an act of violence by a man. After a party, I was shot twice as I walked away from him. We were not in a relationship. Truthfully, I was shocked that I ended up in that place".<ref name="Away" />
