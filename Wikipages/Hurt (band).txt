'''Hurt''' is an American rock band formed in [[Virginia]] in 2000. The band has released four major label albums. The band first released the independent albums ''Hurt'' in 2000 and ''The Consumation'' in 2003. The band received worldwide acclaim with their major label debut album, ''[[Vol. 1 (Hurt album)|Vol. 1]]'', released on March 21, 2006. Their singles "Rapture" and "Falls Apart" garnered significant radio airplay. Their second album was the critically acclaimed ''[[Vol. II (Hurt album)|Vol. II]]'', released on September 25, 2007, and they gained their largest radio hit yet with the single "Ten Ton Brick".

The band went on to release two more albums, ''[[Goodbye to the Machine]]'' and ''[[The Crux (album)|The Crux]]''. They then disbanded in 2014 shortly before a release of ''Self-Entitled'', a re-release of their first album which was self-titled. No new material has been released since 2012. Cryptic videos were posted to the band's official Facebook page on December 24 and 27, 2019, suggesting the band would be releasing new material.

==History==
===Formation and independent releases (2000–2005)===
The band originally composed of J. Loren Wince, age 15, as the main singer, songwriter, and guitarist and Wil Quaintance as a drummer. The two sought other band members for years until picking up Steven Fletcher to play bass guitar. The band was named two years later, upon conception of their first album.

This band's self-titled first studio album was written and performed by Wince and Wil Quaintance on drums, with programming credits given to Brian Winshell on the entire album, except "Confession" by Jonathan Minis. It was released in 2000 and approximately 1,200 copies were created. The band's second independently released album, ''[[The Consumation]]'' was also written and performed by Wince, with Quaintance on drums, Shawn Sawyer on bass and given credits on the song "Unclean", with Brian Winshell on Engineering for "House of Cards" and "Velvet Rolls Royce". This album was released in 2003 in Wince's home state of [[Virginia]], with approximately 2000 sold, and around 3000 promos and full albums distributed for free.

The band (with the original line-up) was discovered by Tom Lewis, an ex-[[Universal Records]] A&R man, somewhere around 2005. The show was at The Continental in New York, where a friend of Lewis, Jay Silverman, passed the band's CD on to him.<ref name=foruminterview>{{cite web|title=Interview with J. Loren by John Shoulders |url=http://hurt.forumsunlimited.com/index.php?showtopic=2674&st=0 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080903141505/http://hurt.forumsunlimited.com/index.php?showtopic=2674 |archive-date=September 3, 2008 }}, March 30, 2008</ref> After the initial contact with Wince, it was another 8 months until they heard from Lewis again. The band met up with Lewis and his company (Metropolitan Hybrid).<ref name=allaccess>{{cite web | title=Interview with HURT by Scott Stratton | url=http://www.allaccessmagazine.com/vol4/issue03/hurt.html | access-date=March 31, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212124402/http://www.allaccessmagazine.com/vol4/issue03/hurt.html | archive-date=February 12, 2009 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The band went to record its demo to help find a record label. After undisclosed issues with the current drummer for the band, session drummer Evan Johns was asked if he could be a part of the recording, which Wince agreed to.<ref name=hitrock>{{cite web|title=Interview with J. Loren of HURT by Tim Nydell |url=http://www.hitrockbottom.org/hurt.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106200722/http://www.hitrockbottom.org/hurt.html |archive-date=January 6, 2009 }}, December 29, 2007</ref>

In the process of trying to find a major label, the bass player at the time decided it would be best if he quit the band, at which time they began to seek out his replacement, former [[Streetlight Manifesto]] bassist Josh Ansley.<ref name=hitrock/>

When asked about how he became part of the band, Paul Spatola has been quoted in saying that he received a phone call from Josh Ansley, saying he should fly to New York and try out for the band, as they were looking for guitarists. Spatola states, "A month later I didn't hear anything and I said 'I just gotta fly out there.'" His first performance with the band was at a night club called 'The Mint,' at which time, Spatola intended on being with the band for a few days but ended up staying for two weeks. The first day he tried out for the band, and with a little help from Tom Lewis, Wince was convinced to bring Spatola into the band as the guitarist.<ref name=allaccess/>

The next day, the band played a showcase in New York City, at which time they had spoken with several record companies including [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], [[Interscope Records|Interscope]], [[Island Records|Island]], [[Universal Records|Universal]], [[Virgin Records|Virgin]] and [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]], but nothing came of these conversations.<ref name=allaccess/>

Initially, [[Capitol Records]] had purchased the album, [[Vol. 1 (Hurt album)|Vol. 1]], from the band at cost which was approximately 100k. No other apparent changes other than signing the recordings rights to them took place.<ref name=foruminterview/>

===''Vol. 1'' and ''Vol. II'' (2006–2008)===
[[File:Victor hurt.jpg|thumb|left|Victor Ribas, the band's drummer]]
The band's first work under a major record label would be two albums entitled ''[[Vol. 1 (Hurt album)|Vol. 1]]'' and ''[[Vol. II (Hurt album)|Vol. II]]''. They were both recorded and produced with Eric Greedy. The initial plan was to have the albums be released as a double album, but [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] rejected the idea as "too much of an investment at once". Instead, the band used the extra time to re-record and improve upon ''Vol. II''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hurt Elevate Worn Road Of Hard Rock by Brett Hickman |url=http://www.staticmultimedia.com/music/features/hurt_elevate_worn_road_of_hard_rock |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071126120641/http://www.staticmultimedia.com/music/features/hurt_elevate_worn_road_of_hard_rock |archive-date=November 26, 2007 }}, October 21, 2007</ref> ''Vol. 1'' was released on March 21, 2006. Three singles were released to radio – "Rapture", "Falls Apart", and "Danse Russe". ''Vol. II'' was later released on September 25, 2007, along with two more singles, "Ten Ton Brick" and "Loded". After their having major record label exposure, the band opted to re-release ''The Consumation'' as ''The Re-Consumation'' on February 19, 2008, in response to fans spending hundreds of dollars to buy their now-rare original independent releases. The re-released contained one new song, and two other altered songs. Shortly afterwards, in April, Ansley announced his departure from the band, to pursue a career in writing and directing.

On May 12, 2009, Hurt received an award for the song "Ten Ton Brick" during [[SESAC]]'s 13th annual New York Music Awards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sesac.com/events/Event_News_Details.aspx?id=926 |title=SESAC Holds 13th Annual Music Awards |access-date=June 19, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329142841/https://www.sesac.com/events/Event_News_Details.aspx?id=926 |archive-date=March 29, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===''Goodbye to the Machine'' (2009–2010)===
''Vol. 1'' and ''Vol. II'' did not prove to be commercial successes, and as a result, the band was dropped from Capitol Records. Their next album, ''[[Goodbye to the Machine]]'', would be an allusion to the band's negativity towards major record labels. The album was released on April 7, 2009, on the much smaller label Amusement Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tunelabmusic.com/2009/01/13/hurt-announce-release-date-for-goodbye-to-the-machine/ |title=Hurt Announce Release Date For 'Goodbye to the Machine' &#124; TuneLab |publisher=Tunelabmusic.com |access-date=July 1, 2011}}</ref> Prior to the album's release, the single "Wars" was released to radio on February 3, 2009. The album has peaked at No.100 on the Billboard 200.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===''The Crux'' (2010–2014)===
The band began working on new material in early 2010. On February 5 the new song "Numbers" made its debut radio play on 94.1 WJJO in Madison, WI. It was released on iTunes on March 9, 2010, with artwork by Spatola.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hurt Message Board: New Song Videos |url=http://hurt.forumsunlimited.com/index.php?showtopic=6643 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711021405/http://hurt.forumsunlimited.com/index.php?showtopic=6643 |archive-date=July 11, 2011 }}</ref> On March 21, the band announced that all tracking had been completed.<ref>{{cite web |title= Hurt Facebook page |url= http://www.facebook.com/hurt |website=Facebook.com}}</ref> In August, the band announced they had signed to Carved Records, and aimed to release a new album in early 2012. It was also announced that Spatola had departed the band due to personal issues. On September 27, 2011, on Hurt's Facebook page, the band said that the new album would be a return to both the ''Vol.'' albums, in sound and style. The first single, "How We End Up Alone", was released through iTunes on January 3, 2012 and peaked at Number 10 on the Billboard 20. ''[[The Crux (Hurt album)|The Crux]]'' was released on May 1, 2012, and peaked at Number 75 on Billboard 200. This was the highest Billboard placement in the band's history, and the last time the world would see new material from the Band.

On April 8, 2014 Amusement Management announced their intentions to release a remastered version of the often spoke of the band's self-titled album, stating "It will be remastered and come with a handwritten replication of the lyrics by J. It will most likely not be available digitally". The announcement was made on the band's official Facebook page.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/hurt/posts/10152310350409462 |title=Hurt - We're planning on releasing a limited edition of... |website=Facebook.com |access-date=April 13, 2020}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=January 2020}} The album was released in a limited quantity of only 2000, each individual numbered and signed by J Loren Wince. The album included two bonus tracks; one previously unreleased, "Cellophane", and another, the original version of "Talking to God".
