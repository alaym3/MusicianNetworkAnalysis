== Biography ==

=== Early years ===

Luz Casal is the daughter of José Casal and Matilde Paz. When she went to live in Avilés she studied at Paula Frassinetti School, founded by the Dorotean Sisters of Charity. Then, the family went to live in the town of [[Gijón]] where she performed for the first time in front of fifty people. There, she studied piano and ballet, apart from that, she formed part of a Rock group called Los Fannys that made versions of other artist's songs. Luz formed part of another band too that performed in [[Asturias]], [[León, Spain|León]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. Nevertheless, she always wanted to be a solo singer.

In 1977, to start her career on the music scene, and after convincing her parents, she went to [[Madrid]], where she made her first recording called: "La guapa" (The beautiful), and made contact with a lot of record labels until an independent production company gave her an audition as a backing singer, which is how she entered the world of professional music. She was a backing singer for mand artist's recordings, in fact she accompanies [[Juan Pardo (singer)|Juan Pardo]] in his live performances. From that moment on, she started composing her first songs, of which she recorded ten, but they were not released. In these years, she made her only appearance in the theatre, taking the role of [[Raquel Meller]] in the musical "Las Divinas" (The Divines), performed in the Reina Victoria theatre in [[Madrid]].

In 1980 she released her first single with a multinational company, "El ascensor" (The elevator), a song with a strong [[Reggae]] flavour as a tribute to [[Bob Marley]]. She presented this song in "Tocata", a very popular music show in [[RTVE]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Canal Nostalgia|title=Luz Casal – El ascensor (1980)|date=1 May 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjl6SX2RQ4E|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref> After that she took part in many festivals held in a lot of countries and took dance classes with [[Karen Taft]], Arnold Taraborelli, [[Lindsay Kemp]], Merche Esmeralda and [[Goyo Montero]].

The following year she started the recording of her first solo album, en Madrid, Brussels and Amsterdam, which was released in September 1982 and was named: "Luz". The album was produced by Carlos Narea, and included songs composed by herself and by Roque Navaja. She appeared for the first time in a TV program, and participated in a book-album of the poet Xaime Noguerol. In 1983 she recorded the video of the [[Maxi single]] "No aguanto más" (I can't stand anymore), then she started making live performances and took part in the tour The rock of a summer night, with [[Miguel Ríos]] and [[Leño]], with whom she performed in 35 cities of Spain.

In 1984 she released her second album, "Los ojos del gato" (The eyes of the cat), recorded in Spain, [[Belgium]] and (Germany). Some of the songs, written by Ramoncín and Hilario Camacho, started being listened in the whole Europe. Luz kept on studying: piano, chorus and performance. Luz III, released a y year later, in 1985, contains a very popular track called "Rufino", by Carmen Santonja (Member of the band Vainica Doble). That year she performed in a festival held in [[Czechoslovakia]], with artists from other countries; Luz still remembers the impact of listening "No aguanto más" and "Ciudad sin ley" (Lawless city) being played by an orchestra with Wind instruments. In 1986 she gave more than 90 concerts and performed again for [[Česká televize|Czech Television]]. In (Germany) she recorded the song "The water is life", for an environmental campaign, with stars such as [[Mark Knopfler]].

In 1987 she recorded an a capella song with the group 'The Christians' for a television program and in May of that year, her next album "Quiéreme aunque te duela" (Love me even if it hurts you), was launched, in which she started to be less of a rocker and discovered herself as a great ballad performer, ballads that would be the greatest hits of that release. The album included her smash hit "[[A Cada Paso]]", which became her breakout hit in [[Latin America|Latin-America]], it climbed to the number one position in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Mexico; the Mexican female pop-band [[Flans]] made a cover of the song in 1990, and also became a big hit in that country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://luzcasal.es/biografia/|title=Luz Casal Biografia |accessdate=16 October 2013 |publisher=luzcasal.es|language=spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.esmas.com/entretenimiento/biografias/010535/flans/|title=Flans Datos Biograficos |accessdate=16 October 2013 |publisher=esmas.com|language=spanish}}</ref> She participated in the TV program "¡Qué noche la de aquel año!"

=== Massive success ===

In 1989 Luz Casal released her new company [[Hispavox]], the album "V" in which Luz counted with the production of Paco Trinidad and Chucho Merchán, a habitual musician of [[Eurythmics]]. The album, which sold over 300,000 copies and was her definitive leap to stardom, includes two of the most important songs of her career: "Te Dejé Marchar" (I Let You Go) and "No Me Importa Nada" (Nothing Matters For Me). That year she took part in a festival held in Chile in favour of human rights, among artists and groups such as [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and [[U2]].

In 1991 Luz, released ''A Contraluz'' (Backlight), which sold over 400,000 copies, obtaining four [[platinum album]]s. In this album is the [[bolero]] "Piensa en mí" (Think Of Me), composed by [[Agustín Lara]], and the song "Un año de amor" were chosen by [[Pedro Almodóvar]] for his film ''Tacones Lejanos'' (High Heels). Almodóvar translated the latter song, originally by the French [[Nino Ferrer]], from the Italian hit version by [[Mina (Italian singer)|Mina]]. These two massive hits made her a European superstar, especially admired in France.

Following that, Luz took a four-year break away from recording studies, a time when she started thinking about her career because of her success, but she kept on performing in Spain, Latin America, France and other European countries.

In early 1995, Luz travelled to London, with producer Paco Trinidad, to work with [[Eurythmics]] engineer [[Darren Allison]] and the members of [[Paul McCartney]]'s band, namely [[Paul Wickens|Paul"Wix" Wickens]], and Robbie Mackintosh, on tracks for her next album, entitled ''Como La Flor Prometida'' (Like The Promised Flower).
