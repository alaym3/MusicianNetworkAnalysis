Ware was educated at [[Alleyn's School]], a co-educational independent school in [[Dulwich]] in South London, where she was a schoolmate of [[Florence Welch]], [[Jack Peñate]], and Felix White of [[The Maccabees (band)|the Maccabees]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Maclean|first=Craig|date=17 February 2013|title=Watch this face: Jessie Ware is the new queen of the Brits|url=https://independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/watch-this-face-jessie-ware-is-the-new-queen-of-the-brits-8493763.html|publisher=independent.co.uk}}</ref> She then attended the [[University of Sussex]], where she graduated with a degree in English literature.<ref>[https://theguardian.com/music/2012/feb/26/jessie-ware-one-to-watch One to watch: Jessie Ware] Publisher: ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper.

==Music career==
===2009–11: Career beginnings===
In the years prior to releasing her first solo album, Ware did backing vocals at live shows for [[Jack Peñate]] (who took her on tour in the U.S.) and Man Like Me. Ware said she learned a lot during her time with Jack Peñate: "Performing with him was really good training, because I got to learn all about how other people do it – I was able to perform live without the pressure of being a lead singer. It gave me a taste of what to expect, and it prepared me for what I’m doing now."<ref>{{cite web|last=Duncan|first=Alasdair|title=Jessie Ware Wildest Dreams|url=http://thebrag.com/2013/01/30/music-interview-jessie-ware|publisher=The Brag}} {{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

One of Peñate's bandmates, Tic, first introduced Ware to [[SBTRKT]]; Ware and SBTRKT went on to collaborate on 'Nervous' (2010). She consequently met [[Sampha]], then known as SBTRKT's main collaborator. They created "[[Valentine (Jessie Ware and Sampha song)|Valentine]]" together, which was released on a special edition, heart-shaped vinyl by [[Young Turks (record label)|Young Turks]] in 2011. "Valentine" was partly inspired by [[James Blake (musician)|James Blake]]'s song "[[The Wilhelm Scream]]" and based on their own personal experiences in love.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jessie Ware|url=http://redbullstudios.com/london/artists/jessie-ware|publisher=Red Bull Studios London}}</ref> The music video for "Valentine" was directed by [[Marcus Söderlund]].<ref name="youtube">{{cite web|url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=2M6VItZtAh4|title=Jessie Ware & Sampha – Valentine – YouTube |publisher=youngturksrecords / YouTube.com |date=26 November 2012}}</ref> "Nervous", "Valentine" and an additional collaboration with DJ Joker ("The Vision") led Ware to a record deal with [[PMR Records]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Smirke|first=Richard|title=Jessie Ware, Mercury Prize Nominee, Preps EP for U.S. Release|url=http://billboard.com/articles/news/1481519/jessie-ware-mercury-prize-nominee-preps-ep-for-us-release|work=Billboard|date=8 December 2012}}</ref> She also featured on ''[[Ceremonials]]'', the 2011 album by [[Florence and the Machine]] in which her good friend [[Florence Welch]] is lead singer.

On 14 October 2011, Ware released her debut solo single "Strangest Feeling" on limited 10" purple vinyl,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://boomkat.com/vinyl/508363-jessie-ware-strangest-feeling |title=Strangest Feeling by Jessie Ware – 10" – Boomkat – Your independent music specialist |publisher=boomkat.com |date=14 November 2011 |access-date=28 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023012213/http://boomkat.com/vinyl/508363-jessie-ware-strangest-feeling |archive-date=23 October 2012}}</ref> although the song did not chart in the [[UK Singles Chart|United Kingdom]].

===2011–13: ''Devotion''===

On 20 August 2012, Ware released her debut album ''[[Devotion (Jessie Ware album)|Devotion]]'', which peaked at number&nbsp;five on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. She then released "[[Running (Jessie Ware song)|Running]]" on 24 February 2012 as the lead single from her debut studio album, ''[[Devotion (Jessie Ware album)|Devotion]]''.

Ware contributed a song for [[Nicki Minaj]]'s third studio album, ''[[The Pinkprint]]'' (2014), called "The Crying Game" in which Minaj alternates between "devastating verses and pensive crooning" whilst Ware adds "haunting" and "soulful" vocals to the chorus.<ref>{{cite web|title=Update: Nicki Minaj's The Pinkprint Leaked: Here's a Track-by-Track Breakdown|url=http://slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/12/12/nicki_minaj_s_the_pinkprint_leaked_here_s_a_track_by_track_breakdown_of.html/|work=Slate| access-date=17 December 2014}}</ref> Originally, Ware only received a songwriting credit, but she was then credited on updated versions of the album.
