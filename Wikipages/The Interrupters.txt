'''''The Interrupters''''' is a 2011 [[documentary film]], produced by [[Kartemquin Films]], that tells the story of three [[violence interrupter]]s who try to protect their Chicago communities from the violence they once employed.  It examines a year in which Chicago drew national headlines for violence and murder that plagued the city.

The film features the work of [[CeaseFire (organization)|CeaseFire]], an initiative of the [[Chicago Project for Violence Prevention]]. In 2004, [[Tio Hardiman]] (ex-Director of CeaseFire Illinois) created and implemented The Violence Interrupter concept. Violence interrupters Ameena Matthews, Cobe Williams and Eddie Bocanegra look back on their past experiences with street violence to try to steer young men and women in the right direction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kartemquin.com/films/the-interrupters/ |title=The Interrupters |publisher=Kartemquin.com |access-date=2014-08-14}}</ref>  Matthews, the daughter of former Chicago gang leader [[Jeff Fort]], comes to the aid of the mother of [[Derrion Albert]], a Chicago high school student whose death made national headlines when it was captured on videotape.

Produced by [[Kartemquin Films]], ''The Interrupters'' is directed by [[Steve James (producer)|Steve James]], director of the documentary ''[[Hoop Dreams]]'',<ref>{{cite web|author=The Editors |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20010708/REVIEWS08/107080301/1023/ |title=Hoop Dreams Movie Review & Film Summary (1994) &#124; Roger Ebert |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date=2001-07-08 |access-date=2014-08-14}}</ref> and co-produced by [[Alex Kotlowitz]], author of [[There Are No Children Here: The Story of Two Boys Growing Up in the Other America|''There Are No Children Here'']].<ref>[http://www.alexkotlowitz.com/02_03.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325232528/http://www.alexkotlowitz.com/02_03.html |date=March 25, 2010 }}</ref>

==Setting==
The documentary takes place on [[South Side, Chicago|Chicago's South Side]] in a myriad of troubled communities.  One of the main communities featured is [[Englewood, Chicago|Englewood]].  Englewood lies approximately 12 miles south of the Loop and began as a home to German and Irish farm and railroad workers.<ref name="autogenerated2005">"Englewood." Encyclopedia of Chicago. Chicago:  Chicago Historical Society, 2005. Web. 5 Mar 2012</ref><ref name="autogenerated1">"Zook."Black P Stones." Chicago Gangs. (2012) Web. 5 Mar 2012</ref>

However, after World War II, Englewood and the South Side of Chicago as a whole became known as the "Black Belt."  This is in reference to the predominantly African American population moving to this area.  As of the year 2000, 0.6% of Englewood residents are White, while 98.2% are Black or African American.  5.2% of Englewood residents over the age of twenty-five have obtained a bachelor's degree or higher. The unemployment rate of Englewood residents over the age of sixteen is 25.8%.<ref name="autogenerated2005"/><ref name="autogenerated1"/>

Residents participate in gang activities and [[drug trafficking]] to make money.  The crime statistics for February 24, 2012 detail thirty-three documented crimes in a span of twenty-four hours.  One third of those crimes were narcotic offenses.<ref name="autogenerated2005"/><ref name="autogenerated1"/>

Most of the drug activity can be traced back to two notorious gangs that run the area: The [[Gangster Disciples]] and the [[Black P Stones]].  The Interrupters' Ameena Matthews has ties to the Black P Stones as her father, Jeff Fort, was the founder and leader.<ref name="autogenerated2005"/><ref name="autogenerated1"/>
