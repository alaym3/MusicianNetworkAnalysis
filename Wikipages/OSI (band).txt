'''OSI''' is an American [[progressive rock]] band, originally formed by [[Fates Warning]] guitarist [[Jim Matheos]] in 2002. [[Chroma Key]] keyboardist and vocalist [[Kevin Moore]] is the only other full-time member of the band. The collaboration may be considered a studio project, as its members and contributors write and track most of their material independently, sharing and developing tracks long-distance, only coming together at the end of the process for mixing and additional tracking. The band's name is a reference to the [[Office of Strategic Influence]], a short-lived American [[government agency]] formed in 2001 to support the War on Terror through propaganda. The band has featured a number of guest musicians on its albums, including [[Sean Malone]], [[Steven Wilson]], [[Mikael Åkerfeldt|Mikael Akerfeldt]], [[Joey Vera]] and [[Gavin Harrison]].

Matheos recruited Moore, [[Dream Theater]]'s then-drummer [[Mike Portnoy]], and [[Sean Malone]] ([[fretless bass guitar|Fretless Bass]] and [[Chapman Stick]]ist) to perform on what was originally planned to be a Matheos solo album. Matheos and Portnoy originally planned to produce a [[progressive metal]] album similar to Matheos' work in Fates Warning, however Moore's impact changed the music's direction and genre, incorporating [[electronica]] into the original progressive metal sound. [[Office of Strategic Influence (album)|The Band's debut album]] was released by [[Inside Out Music|InsideOut Music]] in 2003.

OSI was originally intended to be a one-off project, but Matheos and Moore found they both had gaps in their schedules so produced a follow-up. ''[[Free (OSI album)|Free]]'' was released in 2006, with Portnoy returning to play drums as a session musician rather than a full band member, due to personal and musical differences between him and Moore. ''[[Blood (OSI album)|Blood]]'' was released in 2009, with [[Porcupine Tree]] drummer [[Gavin Harrison]] replacing Portnoy. The fourth album ''[[Fire Make Thunder]]'' was released in 2012 by [[Metal Blade Records]], with Harrison once again on drums.

Matheos, Moore and Portnoy recorded the album at Carriage House Studios in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] from June 2 to 9, 2002.<ref name=recording>{{cite web | url = http://www.dreamtheater.net/archive_osi.php#llrpix | title = Studio Photos: Jim Matheos, Mike Portnoy, Kevin Moore | work = Dream Theater – Official Site | access-date = February 11, 2010 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091007023302/http://www.dreamtheater.net/archive_osi.php#llrpix | archive-date = October 7, 2009 }}</ref> Songs with a strong progressive metal influence were mostly written by Matheos, while Moore had greater influence over the vocal-driven tracks.

===''Free'' and ''Blood'' (2005–2009)===
{{main|Free (OSI album)|Blood (OSI album)}}
Matheos and Moore did not plan to make a second OSI album, and returned to their own projects after the first album's completion. In 2005, they both had free schedules, so decided to produce a follow-up album. [[Joey Vera]] (also of Fates Warning) played bass on the album.<ref name=caustic>{{cite web | last = LaRose | first = Michelle | url = http://phantomphotography.com/I_OSI.html | title = OSI Interview | work = Caustic Truths | access-date = February 27, 2010 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110101013726/http://phantomphotography.com/I_OSI.html | archive-date = January 1, 2011 }}</ref> Portnoy originally told Matheos and Moore that he did not want to perform drums on the album, but was persuaded to perform on the album as a [[session musician]].<ref name = blistering />

''[[Free (OSI album)|Free]]'' was released on April 24, 2006,<ref name=iout06>{{cite web | url = http://www.insideout.de/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=458 | title = OSI: Free | work = [[InsideOut Music]] | access-date = May 7, 2010 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081125085634/http://www.insideout.de/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=458 | archive-date = November 25, 2008 }}</ref> receiving generally positive critical reception.

In September 2008, Moore posted an update on the Chroma Key website, stating that he and Matheos had been working on a third OSI album for several months.

All other instruments and programming were performed by Matheos and Moore, while lyrics and vocals were handled exclusively by Moore. The recordings for the album, with the exception of drums, were performed at the musician's respective home studio. In July 2011 at [[Sound Farm Studio & Recording Environment]] final overdubs as well as some additional writing and arranging were completed. The band mixed the album alongside engineer Matt Sepanic. Engineer Roger Siebel handled the final mastering.

===''Hiatus'' (2013–present)===
On the current status of O.S.I., co-founder and lead guitarist Jim Matheos offered the following quote in a June 2016 interview about the possibility of a future album, "No, as I just said it's the same situation with John. Kevin and I are both busy doing other things. I believe Kevin is experimenting and working on some Chroma Key material right now, so who knows… In the future I would love to do it and if it happens that's great, but there are no plans right now. My main focus for at least the rest of this year and probably next year is going to be Fates Warning."<ref name = Chris>{{cite web | url = http://noisefull.com/interviews/fates-warning-jim-matheos-0 | title = Fates Warning (Jim Matheos) | work = Interview by Chris Karadimitris and Nikos Katapidis - News | date = June 15, 2016 | access-date = January 20, 2018 }}</ref>

==Musical style==
Moore has described OSI's sound as "a new approach to [[progressive rock]]",<ref name=revelationz>{{cite web | last = Yoni | url = http://www.revelationz.net/index.asp?ID=704 | title = Interview with Kevin Moore – OSI | work = RevelationZ Magazine | access-date = January 19, 2010 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081120151625/http://www.revelationz.net/index.asp?ID=704 | archive-date = November 20, 2008 }}</ref> combining elements of [[progressive metal]] and [[electronica]].<ref name = brave /> Moore considers the two genres to be "almost natural enemies",<ref name = brave /> and that the conflict between the two genres "keeps [the music] interesting".<ref name = brave /> Matheos cites progressive rock and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands such as [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Black Sabbath]] and [[UFO (band)|UFO]] as influences.<ref name = PWorldInt /> Moore described his influences as [[minimal techno]], [[experimental music|experimental]], [[electronic music|electronic]] musicians and "bands that play live and then chop it up".<ref name = ytse />

Matheos and Moore primarily work alone, exchanging files and ideas by email.<ref name = nonema09 /> The writing process for all OSI's albums has been the same, with Matheos sending Moore an idea "from just a guitar riff to elaborate, almost completed songs",<ref name = AboutInt09 /> which Moore then edits and sends back to Matheos.<ref name = AboutInt09 /> Moore, the band's vocalist and lyricist, has described the process of writing lyrics as an "audio [[Rorschach test]]".<ref name = MadeLoud /> The lyrics on ''Office of Strategic Influence'' feature political themes, but the lyrics on later releases are less political, instead being based on Moore's personal experiences. "I'll start writing a song that has a little bit of a world view or political view or something," he said, "but then by the time I'm finished the lyrics it'll be about a relationship or something like that."<ref name = brave /> On ''Blood'', Moore largely abandoned his earlier stream-of-consciousness approach to writing lyrics, in an attempt to make the lyrics more coherent. "I didn't want it to be like 'Oh, you get your own impression of the lyrics. Everybody has their own idea!' I wanted to have an idea that I wanted to communicate, and something communicable," he explained.<ref name=MadeLoud>{{cite web|last=Reilly |first=Andrew |url=http://www.madeloud.com/articles/interviews/madeloud-interview-jim-matheos-and-kevin-moore-osi |title=MadeLoud Interview: Jim Matheos and Kevin Moore of OSI |work=MadeLoud |date=May 19, 2009 |access-date=April 15, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824152435/http://www.madeloud.com/articles/interviews/madeloud-interview-jim-matheos-and-kevin-moore-osi |archive-date=August 24, 2010 }}</ref>

Moore has acknowledged the narrow range of his vocals. He considers his vocal style to "[come] from how I feel when I'm singing, when I'm in the zone of writing lyrics and recording which, a lot of times, comes as the same time. It's sort of an introspective time. A lot of the material lends itself to that kind of voice and that kind of spirit."<ref name = brave />
