Petty also overcame a difficult relationship with his father. According to Petty, his father found it difficult to accept that Petty was "a mild-mannered kid who was interested in the arts" and subjected him to verbal and physical abuse on a regular basis.

==Career==
===1976–1987: Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers===
{{main|Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers}}
Shortly after embracing his musical aspirations, Petty started a band known as the Epics, which later evolved into [[Mudcrutch]]. The band included future Heartbreakers [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]] and [[Benmont Tench]] and was popular in Gainesville, but their recordings went unnoticed by a mainstream audience. They recorded at [[The Church Studio]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]].  Their only single, "Depot Street", released in 1975 by [[Shelter Records]], failed to chart.<ref name="mudcrutch1">{{cite web|last1=Greenberg|first1=Rudi|title=Tom Petty Turned Back the Clock with Mudcrutch at the 9:30 Club in D.C. on June 6|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2016/06/07/tom-petty-turned-back-the-clock-with-mudcrutch-at-the-930-club-in-d-c-on-june-6|website=The Washington Post|access-date=October 3, 2017|date=June 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004040807/https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2016/06/07/tom-petty-turned-back-the-clock-with-mudcrutch-at-the-930-club-in-d-c-on-june-6/|archive-date=October 4, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

After Mudcrutch split up, Petty reluctantly agreed to pursue a solo career. Tench decided to form his own group, whose sound Petty appreciated. Eventually, Petty and Campbell collaborated with Tench, [[Ron Blair]] and [[Stan Lynch]], forming the first lineup of the Heartbreakers. Their [[Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers (album)|eponymous debut album]] gained minute popularity amongst American audiences, achieving greater success in Britain. The singles "[[American Girl (Tom Petty song)|American Girl]]" and "[[Breakdown (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers song)|Breakdown]]" (re-released in 1977) peaked at {{Numero|40}} after the band toured in the United Kingdom in support of [[Nils Lofgren]]. The debut album was released by [[Shelter Records]], which at that time was distributed by [[ABC Records]].<ref name="all music">{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|title=Tom Petty: Biography|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5137/biography|pure_url=yes}}|website=AllMusic|year=2006|access-date=April 12, 2008}}</ref>

[[File:Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers 1977.jpg|thumb|left|Petty (''center'') with the Heartbreakers in 1977]]
Their second album, ''[[You're Gonna Get It!]]'', was the band's first [[Top 40]] album,<ref name="all music" /> featuring the singles "[[I Need to Know (Tom Petty song)|I Need to Know]]" and "[[Listen to Her Heart]]". Their third album, ''[[Damn the Torpedoes (album)|Damn the Torpedoes]]'', quickly went [[RIAA certification|platinum]], selling nearly two million copies; it includes their breakthrough singles "[[Don't Do Me Like That]]", "[[Here Comes My Girl]]", "[[Even the Losers]]" and "[[Refugee (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers song)|Refugee]]".<ref>{{cite web|title=Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers: History of the Band|url=http://www.mudcrutch.com/index.php?pageid=heartbreakers_history|work=Mudcrutch Farm|access-date=April 12, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415150228/http://www.mudcrutch.com/index.php?pageid=heartbreakers_history|archive-date=April 15, 2008}}</ref>

In September 1979, [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]] performed at a [[Musicians United for Safe Energy]] concert at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York.<ref>{{cite web|last=Finn|first=Natalie|title=Raitt, Browne & Nash Rerock Against Nukes|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=08ca35ba-fcf8-4e5d-89a3-db9ecaf79907|publisher=E!|date=October 23, 2007|access-date=April 12, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530083723/http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=08ca35ba-fcf8-4e5d-89a3-db9ecaf79907|archive-date=May 30, 2008}}</ref> Their rendition of "[[Cry to Me]]" was featured on the resulting album, ''[[No Nukes]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|title=''No Nukes'': Overview|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r315362|pure_url=yes}}|website=AllMusic|access-date=April 12, 2008}}</ref>

The 4th album ''[[Hard Promises]]'', released in 1981, became a top-ten hit, going platinum and spawning the hit single "[[The Waiting (song)|The Waiting]]". The album also featured Petty's first duet, "Insider" with [[Stevie Nicks]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Beviglia|first1=Jim|title=Behind The Song: Stevie Nicks with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers|url=http://americansongwriter.com/2016/02/behind-the-song-stevie-nicks-with-tom-petty-and-the-heartbreakers/|website=American Songwriter|access-date=October 3, 2017|date=February 10, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003125217/http://americansongwriter.com/2016/02/behind-the-song-stevie-nicks-with-tom-petty-and-the-heartbreakers/|archive-date=October 3, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Bass player [[Ron Blair]] quit the group and was replaced on the fifth album, ''[[Long After Dark]]'' (1982), by [[Howie Epstein]]; the resulting lineup lasted until 1994. The album contained the hit "[[You Got Lucky]]". In 1985, the band participated in [[Live Aid]], playing four songs at [[John F. Kennedy Stadium]], in [[Philadelphia]]. ''[[Southern Accents]]'' was also released in 1985. This album included the hit single "[[Don't Come Around Here No More]]", which was produced by [[David A. Stewart|Dave Stewart]]. The song's video featured Petty dressed as the [[Hatter (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Mad Hatter]], mocking and chasing Alice from the book ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', then cutting and eating her as if she were a cake. The ensuing tour led to the live album ''[[Pack Up the Plantation: Live!]]'' and an invitation from [[Bob Dylan]]—Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers joined him on his [[True Confessions Tour]]. They also played some dates with the [[Grateful Dead]] in 1986 and 1987. Also in 1987, the group released ''[[Let Me Up (I've Had Enough)]]'' which includes "[[Jammin' Me]]" which Petty wrote with Dylan.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jammin' Me: Review | url={{AllMusic|class=song|id=t2462926|pure_url=yes}} | website=AllMusic|access-date=April 19, 2009}}</ref>

===1988–1991: Traveling Wilburys and solo career===
{{Main|Traveling Wilburys|Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers}}
In 1988, Petty joined [[George Harrison]]'s group, the [[Traveling Wilburys]], which also included [[Bob Dylan]], [[Roy Orbison]], and [[Jeff Lynne]]. The band's first song, "[[Handle with Care (song)|Handle with Care]]", was intended as a B-side of one of Harrison's singles, but was judged too good for that purpose and the group decided to record a full album, ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1]]''. A second Wilburys album, mischievously titled ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3]]'' and recorded without the recently deceased Orbison, followed in 1990. The album was named ''Vol. 3'' as a response to a series of bootlegged studio sessions being sold as ''Travelling Wilburys Vol. 2''. Petty incorporated Traveling Wilburys songs into his live shows, consistently playing "Handle with Care" in shows from 2003 to 2006, and for his 2008 tour adding "surprises" such as "[[End of the Line (Traveling Wilburys song)|End of the Line]]" to the set list.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Graff|first1=Gary|title=Tom Petty / May 31, 2008 / Auburn Hills, Mich.

In 1989, Petty released ''[[Full Moon Fever]]'', which featured hits "[[I Won't Back Down]]", "[[Free Fallin']]" and "[[Runnin' Down a Dream]]". It was nominally his first solo album, although several Heartbreakers and other well-known musicians participated: [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]] co-produced the album with Petty and Jeff Lynne of [[Electric Light Orchestra]], and backing musicians included Campbell, Lynne, and fellow Wilburys Roy Orbison and George Harrison ([[Ringo Starr]] appears on drums in the video for "I Won't Back Down", but they were actually performed by Phil Jones).<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Readers' Poll: Tom Petty's 10 Best Songs|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/readers-poll-tom-pettys-10-best-songs-20130619/5-i-wont-back-down-0964154|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=June 19, 2013|access-date=October 3, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003125323/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/readers-poll-tom-pettys-10-best-songs-20130619/5-i-wont-back-down-0964154|archive-date=October 3, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Petty and the Heartbreakers reformed in 1991 and released ''[[Into the Great Wide Open]]'', which was co-produced by Lynne and included the hit singles "[[Learning to Fly (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers song)|Learning To Fly]]" and "[[Into the Great Wide Open (song)|Into the Great Wide Open]]", the latter featuring [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Faye Dunaway]] in the music video.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Patridge|first1=Kenneth|title=Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' 'Into the Great Wide Open' at 25: Classic Track-by-Track Album Lookback|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7423932/tom-petty-heartbreakers-into-the-great-wide-open-25-years|magazine=Billboard|access-date=October 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014202211/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7423932/tom-petty-heartbreakers-into-the-great-wide-open-25-years|archive-date=October 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Views on artistic control==
Petty was known as a staunch guardian of his [[artistic control]] and [[artistic freedom]]. In 1979, he was involved in a legal dispute when [[ABC Records]] was sold to [[MCA Records]]. He refused to be transferred to another record label without his consent. In May 1979, he filed for bankruptcy and was signed to the new MCA subsidiary [[Backstreet Records]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Runnin' Down a Dream: Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers|first=Tom|last=Petty|year=2007|publisher=Chronicle Books|page=[https://archive.org/details/runnindowndream00tomp/page/79 79]|isbn=978-0-811-86201-1|url=https://archive.org/details/runnindowndream00tomp/page/79}}</ref>

In early 1981, the upcoming Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers album, which would become ''[[Hard Promises]]'', was slated to be the next MCA release with the new list price of $9.98, following [[Steely Dan]]'s ''[[Gaucho (album)|Gaucho]]'' and the [[Olivia Newton-John]]/[[Electric Light Orchestra]] ''[[Xanadu (soundtrack)|Xanadu]]'' soundtrack. This so-called "superstar pricing" was $1.00 more than the usual list price of $8.98.<ref>{{cite news |last=Goldstein |first=Patrick |title=Petty Battling MCA Over Record Price Hike |work=Los Angeles Times |date=February 1, 1981 |page=N72}}</ref> Petty voiced his objections to the price hike in the press and the issue became a popular cause among music fans.

In 1987, Petty sued tire company [[Goodrich Corporation|B.F. Goodrich]] for $1&nbsp;million for using a song very similar to his song "Mary's New Car" in a TV commercial.

In January 2015, it was revealed that Petty and [[Jeff Lynne]] would receive royalties from [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]]'s song "[[Stay with Me (Sam Smith song)|Stay with Me]]" after its writers acknowledged similarities between it and "[[I Won't Back Down]]".
