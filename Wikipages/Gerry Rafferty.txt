'''Gerald Rafferty''' (16 April 1947{{nbsp}}– 4 January 2011) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[rock music|rock]] singer-songwriter.  His solo hits in the late 1970s included "[[Baker Street (song)|Baker Street]]", "[[Right Down the Line]]" and "[[Night Owl (Gerry Rafferty song)|Night Owl]]", as well as "[[Stuck in the Middle with You]]", which was recorded with the band [[Stealers Wheel]] in 1973.

Rafferty was born into a working-class family in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire]], Scotland. His mother taught him both Irish and Scottish folk songs when he was a boy; later, he was influenced by the music of [[the Beatles]] and [[Bob Dylan]].  He joined the folk-pop group [[the Humblebums]] (of which [[Billy Connolly]] was a member) in 1969. After they disbanded in 1971, he recorded his first solo album, ''[[Can I Have My Money Back?]]''. Rafferty and [[Joe Egan (musician)|Joe Egan]] formed the group Stealers Wheel in 1972 and produced several hits, most notably "Stuck in the Middle with You" and "[[Star (Stealers Wheel song)|Star]]". In 1978, he recorded his second solo album, ''[[City to City]]'', which included "Baker Street", his most popular song.

==Early years==
[[Image:Foxbar Paisley Renfrewshire.jpg|thumb|left|[[Foxbar]] in Paisley, Renfrewshire, where Rafferty grew up]]

Rafferty grew up in a [[council house]] in the town's [[Ferguslie Park]], in Underwood Lane, and was educated at [[St Mirin's Academy]].<ref name="T obit"/> His Irish-born father, an alcoholic, was a miner and lorry driver who died when Rafferty was 16.<ref name="G obit"/> Rafferty learned both [[Music of Ireland#Traditional music|Irish]] and [[Music of Scotland#Folk music|Scottish folk songs]] as a boy. He recalled, "My father was Irish, so growing up in Paisley I was hearing all these songs when I was two or three. Songs like [[She Moved Through the Fair|'She Moves Through the Fair']], which my mother sings beautifully. And a whole suite of Irish traditional songs and Scots traditional songs".<ref name="irwin" /><ref name="kilbride" /> Heavily influenced by folk music and the music of [[the Beatles]] and [[Bob Dylan]], Rafferty started to write his own material.<ref name="T obit">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/music-obituaries/8239825/Gerry-Rafferty.html |title=Music Obituaries: Gerry Rafferty |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=4 January 2011 |access-date=4 January 2011 |location=London |archive-date=7 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107102052/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/music-obituaries/8239825/Gerry-Rafferty.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Musical career==
Rafferty left St Mirin's Academy in 1963. He then worked in a butcher's shop, as a civil service clerk, and in a shoe shop. However, he explained in an interview, "But there was never anything else for me but music. I never intended making a career out of any of the jobs I did."<ref name="paisleyde" /> On weekends he and a classmate, future [[Stealers Wheel]] collaborator [[Joe Egan (musician)|Joe Egan]], played in a local group named the Maverix, mainly covering chart songs by groups such as the Beatles and [[the Rolling Stones]].<ref name=forsyth>{{cite web|last=Forsyth|first=Janice|title=Interview with Gerry Rafferty|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00x8fsj|work=BBC Radio Scotland|access-date=25 October 2012|quote=We were playing in dance halls... songs from the charts...

In 1966, Rafferty and Egan were members of the band the Fifth Column. The group released the single "Benjamin Day"/"There's Nobody Here" (Columbia 8068), but it was not a commercial success.

===The Humblebums/Stealers Wheel===
In 1969 Rafferty became the third member of a folk-pop group, [[the Humblebums]], along with comedian [[Billy Connolly]] and Tam Harvey. Harvey left shortly afterwards, and Rafferty and Connolly continued as a duo, recording two more albums for [[Transatlantic Records]]. A 1970 appearance at the [[Royal Festival Hall]], supporting [[Fotheringay]] with [[Nick Drake]], earned a positive review from critic [[Karl Dallas]], who noted that all three acts showed "promise rather than fulfilment", and observed that "Gerry Rafferty's songs have the sweet tenderness of [[Paul McCartney]] in his 'Yesterday' mood".<ref>{{cite news|last=Dallas|first=Karl|title=Group of Promise|newspaper=The Times|date=1 April 1970|pages=11}}</ref> In his own stand-up shows, Connolly has often recalled this period, telling how Rafferty made him laugh and describing the crazy things they did while on tour. Once Rafferty decided to look in the [[Berlin]] telephone directory to see if any [[Hitlers]] were listed.<ref>Undated "Prank call" video of Billy Connolly on YouTube, uploaded 25 November 2007, Connolly remembers Rafferty as a prank call "expert... he used to make me scream.... We were looking for [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] in a German phone book – and there are none!"</ref>

After the duo separated in 1971, Transatlantic owner [[Nathan Joseph]] signed Rafferty as a solo performer. Rafferty recorded his first solo album, ''[[Can I Have My Money Back?]]'', with Hugh Murphy, a staff producer working for the label.<ref name=bencromer>{{cite magazine|last=Cromer|first=Ben|title=Profile: Hugh Murphy Gets it Right with Gerry Rafferty|magazine=Billboard|date=12 June 1993|page=66A}}</ref> ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' praised the album as "high-grade folk-rock", describing it as Rafferty's "finest work" to date: "His tunes are rich and memorable with an undeniable charm that will definitely see him into the album and very possibly singles charts soon".<ref>{{cite news|title=British Scene|work=Billboard|date=6 November 1971|pages=RN-24}}</ref> Yet although the album was a critical success, it did not enjoy commercial success. According to Rafferty's daughter Martha, it was around this time that her father discovered, by chance, [[Colin Wilson]]'s classic book [[The Outsider (Colin Wilson)|''The Outsider'']], about [[Social alienation|alienation]] and creativity, which became a huge influence both on his songwriting and his outlook on the world: "The ideas and references contained in that one book were to sustain and inspire him for the rest of his life."<ref name=martharaffbiog>{{cite web|last=Rafferty|first=Martha|title=Gerry Rafferty: Where to Begin?|url=http://www.gerryrafferty.com/biography|access-date=2 June 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430165624/http://www.gerryrafferty.com/biography|archive-date=30 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Rafferty later confirmed that alienation was the "persistent theme" of his songs;<ref name="rollingstone78" /><ref name=chilton>{{cite news|last=Chilton|first=Martin|title=Gerry Rafferty and his songs of alienation|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/8241127/Gerry-Rafferty-and-his-songs-of-alienation.html|access-date=2 June 2012|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=5 January 2011|location=London|archive-date=12 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112025603/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/8241127/Gerry-Rafferty-and-his-songs-of-alienation.html|url-status=live}}</ref> "To Each and Everyone", from ''Can I Have My Money Back?'', was an early example.

[[File:Stealers Wheel - TopPop 1973 1.png|thumb|left|Rafferty with Stealers Wheel on [[TopPop]] in 1973]]
In 1972, having gained some airplay from his Signpost recording "Make You, Break You", Rafferty joined Egan to form Stealers Wheel and recorded three albums with the American songwriters and producers [[Leiber & Stoller]]. The group was beset by legal wranglings, but had a huge hit with "[[Stuck in the Middle with You]]", which earned critical acclaim as well as commercial success: a 1975 article in ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' described it as "a sort of cross between white label Beatles and punk Dylan yet with a unique Celtic flavour that has marked all their work".<ref name=sounds1>{{cite news|title=Join up the jigsaw and you have the Wheel|work=Sounds|publisher=Spotlight Publications|date=15 March 1975|page=34}}</ref> Twenty years later, the song was used prominently in the 1992 movie ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]''; Rafferty refused to grant permission for its re-release.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jolly|first=Mark|title=Film promotion by any music necessary|newspaper=The Times|location=London|date=27 February 1993|pages=10}}</ref> Stealers Wheel also produced the lesser top 50 hits, "Everyone's Agreed That Everything Will Turn Out Fine", followed by "Star", and there were further suggestions of Rafferty's growing alienation in tracks such as "Outside Looking In" and "Who Cares". The duo disbanded in 1975.<ref name="allmusic stealers">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/stealers-wheel-mn0000012877|title=Stealers Wheel &#124; Biography, Albums, Streaming Links|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=3 October 2019|archive-date=4 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704220033/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/stealers-wheel-mn0000012877|url-status=live}}</ref>

===''City to City'' / ''Night Owl''===
[[Image:Baker Street Sign.jpg|thumb|right|A street sign from [[Baker Street]] in central London, the inspiration for Rafferty's famous song]]
Legal issues after the break-up of Stealers Wheel meant that, for three years, Rafferty was unable to release any material.<ref name="allmusic stealers"/> After the disputes were resolved in 1978, he recorded his second solo album, ''[[City to City]]'', with producer Hugh Murphy, which included the song with which he remains most identified, "[[Baker Street (song)|Baker Street]]". According to Murphy, interviewed by ''Billboard'' in 1993, he and Rafferty had to beg the record label, United Artists, to release "Baker Street" as a single: "They actually said it was too good for the public."<ref name=bencromer /> It was a good call: the single reached #3 in the UK and #2 in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/soldonsong/songlibrary/bakerstreet.shtml|title=BBC Radio 2 – Sold on Song – TOP 100 – number 48 – Baker street|access-date=12 September 2008|publisher=BBC Music|archive-date=21 March 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66KDKqMnn?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/soldonsong/songlibrary/bakerstreet.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref> The album sold over 5.5&nbsp;million copies, toppling the ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' soundtrack in the US on 8 July 1978.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200|title=Top 200 Albums &#124; Billboard 200 chart|website=Billboard.com|access-date=3 October 2019|archive-date=4 July 2011|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5zva7hsN5?url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200|url-status=live}}</ref> Rafferty considered this his first proper taste of success, as he told ''Melody Maker'' the following year: "...all the records I've ever done before have been flops. Stealers Wheel was a flop. 'Can I Have My Money Back?' was a flop. The Humblebums were a flop... My life doesn't stand or fall by the amount of people who buy my records."<ref name=melodymaker>{{cite news|last=Gray|first=Michael|title=The Man Who Was Down to Earth|url=http://www.redstone-tech.com/gerry_bsb/melody_maker_1979.htm|access-date=3 June 2012|work=Melody Maker|date=12 May 1979|archive-date=20 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320170001/http://www.redstone-tech.com/gerry_bsb/melody_maker_1979.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

"Baker Street" featured a distinctive saxophone riff played by [[Raphael Ravenscroft]], although the origins of the solo have been disputed.<ref name="melodymaker" /><ref name="Cider">{{cite book | first=Stuart | last=Maconie | year=2004 | title=Cider With Roadies | edition=1st | publisher=Random House | location=London | isbn=978-0-09-189115-2 | page=256}}</ref><ref name="noakes-liner-notes">{{cite book|last=Noakes|first=Rab|title=City to City: Remastered: Collector's Edition: Liner Notes|year=2011|publisher=EMI Records|url=http://gerryrafferty.com/CitytoCityRemasteredCollectorsEdition2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117105157/http://gerryrafferty.com/CitytoCityRemasteredCollectorsEdition2011|archive-date=17 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As the singer recalled in a 1988 interview with Colin Irwin: "When I wrote the song I saw that bit as an instrumental part but I didn't know what. We tried electric guitar but it sounded weak, and we tried other things and I think it was Hugh Murphy's suggestion that we tried saxophone."<ref name="irwin" />

In a 2006 interview with ''The Times'', Ravenscroft recalled the episode differently, claiming he was presented with a song that contained "several gaps". "If you're asking me: 'Did Gerry hand me a piece of music to play?' then no, he didn't. In fact, most of what I played was an old blues riff."<ref name=paphides>{{cite news|last=Paphides|first=Pete|title=Shall we skip the light fandango, m'lud?|newspaper=The Times|location=London|date=24 November 2006|page=14}}</ref><ref name = "sos">{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news-2-15012/stuck-in-a-battle-with-booze-1-1435593|title=Stuck in a battle with booze|website=Scotsman.com|access-date=3 October 2019|archive-date=14 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191214155144/https://www.scotsman.com/news-2-15012/stuck-in-a-battle-with-booze-1-1435593|url-status=live}}</ref> Ravenscroft, a [[session musician]], was in the studio to record a brief [[soprano saxophone]] part and suggested that he record the now famous break using the [[alto saxophone]] he had in his car.
[[File:Hugh Murphy 02.jpg|thumb|right|Hugh Murphy produced seven of Rafferty's solo albums.]]

In his interview with Colin Irwin, Rafferty disputed this and said that Ravenscroft had been his second choice to play the saxophone solo, after [[Pete Zorn]], who was unavailable: "The only confusion at the time that I didn’t enjoy too much was the fact that a lot of people believed that the line was written by Raphael Ravenscroft, the sax player, but it was my line. I sang it to him."<ref name="irwin" /> When a remastered version of ''City to City'' was released in 2011, it included the original, electric guitar version of the song, confirming Rafferty's authorship of the riff. In the liner notes to the album, Rafferty's long-time friend and collaborator [[Rab Noakes]] commented: "Let's hope [the Baker Street demo] will, at last, silence all who keep on asserting that the saxophone player came up with the melody line. He didn't. He just blew what he was told by the person who did write it, Gerry Rafferty."<ref name="noakes-liner-notes" /> [[Michael Gray (author)|Michael Gray]], Rafferty's former manager, agreed: "The audible proof is there from the demos that Rafferty himself created the riff and placed it within the song's structure exactly where it ended up."<ref name=grayouttakes>{{cite web|last=Gray|first=Michael|title=Gerry Rafferty's "Baker Street" Revisited|url=http://michaelgrayouttakes.blogspot.co.uk/2012/01/gerry-raffertys-baker-street-revisited.html|work=Outtakes Blog|access-date=31 May 2012|archive-date=17 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517122050/http://michaelgrayouttakes.blogspot.co.uk/2012/01/gerry-raffertys-baker-street-revisited.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Ravenscroft went on to play on Rafferty's next two albums.

"Baker Street" remains a mainstay of soft-rock radio airplay<ref name = "sos"/> and, in October 2010, it was recognised by the [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] for surpassing 5 million plays worldwide. "Stuck in the Middle With You" has received over 4&nbsp;million plays worldwide, and "Right Down The Line" has had over 3&nbsp;million plays.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bmi.com/news/entry/2010_bmi_london_award_winners|title=2010 BMI London Award Winners|date=5 October 2010|website=BMI.com|access-date=3 October 2019|archive-date=24 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924045020/https://www.bmi.com/news/entry/2010_bmi_london_award_winners|url-status=live}}</ref> In a 2003 interview with ''The Sun (Scotland)'', Rafferty commented on how profitable his biggest song had been, stating: "Baker Street still makes me about £80,000 a year. It's been a huge earner for me. I must admit, I could live off that song alone". The "£80,000" figure has been widely repeated in newspaper articles ever since.<ref name="G obit" /><ref name="T obit" /> Rafferty loathed the 1992 [[Electronic dance music|dance music]] cover version of "Baker Street" by [[Undercover (dance group)|Undercover]], describing it as "dreadful, totally banal–it's a sad sign of the times".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=DiCola |first1=Peter |title=Valuing Control |journal=Michigan Law Review |date=March 2015 |volume=113 |issue=5 |page=683 |jstor=24770794 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24770794 |access-date=30 January 2021 |archive-date=4 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210204104453/https://www.jstor.org/stable/24770794 |url-status=live }}</ref> But it earned him another £1.5&nbsp;million, selling around three million copies in Europe and America. He never let "Baker Street" be used for advertising, despite lucrative offers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wroe|first=Martin|title=In Penny Lane there is an adman selling motor cars|newspaper=The Observer|location=London|date=15 February 1998|quote="Gerry Rafferty has never let Baker Street be used, despite lucrative offers."}}</ref>

"[[City to City#Singles|Right Down the Line]]" was the second single from ''City to City''. The song made No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and No. 1 on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks charts in the US. It remained at the top of the adult contemporary chart for four non-consecutive weeks. The third single from the album, "Home and Dry", reached No. 28 in the US Top 40 in early 1979.<ref name="BBTop40">Joel Whitburn, "The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits (6th Edition)", p. 493.</ref> One of the lesser-known songs from that time is "Big Change in the Weather" (the B-side of "Baker Street").<ref>United Artists Records, Catalogue 1192 (US Release), 1978</ref>

The lyrics of "Baker Street" reflected Rafferty's disenchantment with certain elements of the music industry. This was elaborated on by music journalist [[Paul Gambaccini]] for [[BBC World News]]:.<ref name="BBC">[[BBC World News]] (television), 5 January 2011</ref>

{{cquote|His song "Baker Street" was about how uncomfortable he felt in the star system, and what do you know, it was a giant world hit. The album ''City to City'' went to No. 1 in America, and suddenly he found that as a result of his protest, he was a bigger star than ever. And he now had more of what he didn't like. And although he had a few more hit singles in the United States, by 1980 it was basically all over, and when I say 'it', I mean basically his career, because he just was not comfortable with this.}}

His next album, ''[[Night Owl (album)|Night Owl]]'', also did well. Guitarist [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]] helped by performing on the track "Take The Money and Run", and the title track was a UK No. 5 hit in 1979. "Days Gone Down" reached No. 17 in the US. The follow-up single "Get It Right Next Time" made the UK and US Top 40.

Subsequent albums, such as ''[[Snakes and Ladders (Gerry Rafferty album)|Snakes and Ladders]]'' (1980), ''[[Sleepwalking (Gerry Rafferty album)|Sleepwalking]]'' (1982), and ''[[North and South (album)|North and South]]'' (1988), fared less well, perhaps due partly to Rafferty's longstanding reluctance to perform live, with which he felt uncomfortable.<ref name="melodymaker" />

In 1980, Rafferty and Murphy produced a record for [[Richard and Linda Thompson]]; though never released, it eventually evolved into their album ''[[Shoot Out the Lights]]''.<ref name="irwin" />

The 1982 album ''Sleepwalking'' saw Rafferty taking a very different approach to his work. [[Christopher Neil]] replaced Hugh Murphy, Rafferty's usual producer, introducing synthesisers and drum machines that give the album a harder, less acoustic sound, and apparently eschewing the richly detailed arrangements notable on Rafferty's three previous records. According to Murphy, interviewed a decade later: "Gerry had made three albums on the trot and I think he was pretty jaded at that time and feeling the pressure and he just thought, 'Well, I'll try another tack,' which is understandable".<ref name=bencromer /> Instead of a cover painting and hand-lettering by [[John Byrne (Scottish playwright)|John 'Patrick' Byrne]], who had illustrated every previous Rafferty and Stealers Wheel album, ''Sleepwalking'' featured a simple, stark photograph of an empty road stretching to the sky. There was change too in the songs. The deeply introspective lyrics of ''Sleepwalking'' suggest Rafferty found success far from glamorous: tracks like "Standing at the Gates", "Change of Heart", and "The Right Moment" suggest the singer was exhausted, burnt-out, and desperately seeking a new direction – and continued his long-running theme of alienation. Liner notes for the compilation album ''Right Down the Line'' (prepared with Rafferty's close co-operation<ref name="gilbert2">{{cite web |url=http://www.gerryrafferty.com/index.cfm?go=biography.main |title="Biography": Introductory text to Jerry Gilbert's notes from Gerry Rafferty's website |access-date=14 September 2017 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041010164314/http://www.gerryrafferty.com/index.cfm?go=biography.main |archive-date=10 October 2004 |df=dmy-all }}, Retrieved from Wayback Machine archive of www.gerryrafferty.com, 27 February 2011</ref>) confirmed this several years later, noting the singer was now "finding himself at the crossroads and looking to replace the treadmill with a new dimension in his life".<ref name="gilbert" />

Rafferty sang the [[Mark Knopfler]]-penned song "The Way It Always Starts" (1983) on the soundtrack of the film ''[[Local Hero (album)|Local Hero]]''.

Also in 1983, Rafferty announced his intention to take a break and devote more time to his family: "It dawned on me that since Baker Street I had been touring the world, travelling everywhere and seeing nowhere.

According to his former wife Carla, who discouraged visitors: "He was just stalling for time. Maybe some new project would suddenly happen, but I knew he'd crossed the line as far as the record business went."<ref name="gray1" /> His next album, ''North and South'', was released in 1988. In an interview that year with Colin Irwin to promote the album, Rafferty mentioned that he was interested in doing more production work and writing film soundtracks, and even floated the idea of writing a musical about the life of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]].<ref name="irwin" /> Reviews of the album were mixed. In ''The Times'', critic David Sinclair was particularly scathing: "On North and South, it sounds as if he has thumbed a lift up the road to a mock-Texan bar somewhere in his native Scotland.

In the early 1990s, Rafferty recorded a [[cover version]] of the [[Bob Dylan]] song "[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]" with [[Barbara Dickson]], who had contributed backing vocals to both ''City to City'' and ''Night Owl''. The track appeared on Dickson's albums ''Don't Think Twice It's All Right'' (1992) and ''The Barbara Dickson Collection'' (2006).<ref>[http://www.barbaradickson.net/dont_think_twice_its_all_right.html Don't Think Twice It's All Right] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019215138/http://www.barbaradickson.net/dont_think_twice_its_all_right.html |date=19 October 2013 }} by Barbara Dickson.

===''On a Wing and a Prayer'' / ''Over My Head''===
Rafferty released two further albums in the 1990s in what musician [[Tom Robinson]] later described as "a major return to form".<ref name=rightdowntheline>"Gerry Rafferty: Right Down the Line". TV documentary produced by Neon Productions (Glasgow) for BBC Scotland, co-produced by Valerie Lyon and Robert Noakes, 2011.</ref> ''[[On a Wing and a Prayer]]'' (1992) reunited him with his Stealers Wheel partner Egan on several tracks. It included three tracks co-written with Rafferty's brother Jim, also a singer-songwriter, who had been signed to [[Decca Records]] in the 1970s. Rafferty recorded a new version of his Humblebums song "Her Father Didn't Like Me Anyway" on the album ''[[Over My Head (album)|Over My Head]]'' (1994). These were the last two records Rafferty produced with Hugh Murphy, who died in 1998. According to guitarist Hugh Burns, Murphy's death was "a great blow to Gerry"<ref name=rightdowntheline /> and marked the end of a creative partnership that had lasted almost 30 years.

===''Another World''===
By the end of the 1990s, new technology enabled Rafferty to distance himself even further from the conventional approach of the music industry and work entirely on his own terms. Now based in London, he employed sound engineer Giles Twigg to assemble a [[Digidesign]] mobile recording studio and, with Twigg's help, recorded the album ''Another World'' in London, Scotland, Barbados, France, and Italy with collaborators from previous albums, including Hugh Burns, Mark Knopfler, [[Kenny Craddock]], and [[Mo Foster]].<ref>[http://www.uk.filmcrewpro.com/view.php?uid=263878 Giles Twigg CV details] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711001631/http://www.uk.filmcrewpro.com/view.php?uid=263878 |date=11 July 2011 }}.

''[[Another World (Gerry Rafferty album)|Another World]]'', released in 2000, was originally available only via direct order from his website,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gerryrafferty.com/ |title=Archived version of Gerry Rafferty's Website (6 December 2000) |access-date=26 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000308005440/http://www.gerryrafferty.com/ |archive-date=8 March 2000 |df=dmy-all }}, Retrieved from Wayback Machine, 26 February 2011</ref> but since 2003 has been available on the Hypertension label. ''Another World'', almost an esoteric work, also with the assistance of Mark Knopfler and Egan, featured an album cover illustrated by John 'Patrick' Byrne, who also illustrated the covers for ''Can I Have My Money Back?'', ''City to City'', ''Night Owl'', and ''Snakes and Ladders'', and all three Stealers Wheel albums. Byrne was also responsible for one of Rafferty's most prized possessions: a hand-painted [[C. F. Martin & Company|Martin]] acoustic guitar bearing his portrait and the name 'Gerry Rafferty', which features in many photographs of the singer.<ref name="paisleyde">[http://www.redstone-tech.com/gerry_bsb/paisley/jun23.htm You can take the boy out of Paisley... but you can't take Paisley out the boy!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314082302/http://www.redstone-tech.com/gerry_bsb/paisley/jun23.htm |date=14 March 2011 }}, Paisley Daily Express, 23 June 2000</ref><ref name="gilbert" />

''Another World'' marked a new departure for the singer. As he explained in a press release heralding the new record in November 2000: "My heart and soul have gone into this album, and by releasing it in this way my creative influence has not been diluted in any way."<ref>News Release, PR Newswire, 27 November 2000.</ref> Finally, thanks to the Internet, it seemed Rafferty no longer needed the music industry: technology was allowing him to put his music directly in the hands of an appreciative audience. Rafferty felt he had matured as an artist, as he told the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' at the time of the release: "At my time of life, I don't want to be talking to 23-year-old record executives who are just trying to sell their products to 19-year-olds. I'm older and my audience is older. They'll know where to find me." In the same interview, he said that the entire record had been made for approximately £200,000, with half spent on travel, the recording system costing £75,000, and the website and marketing adding £25,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=From Baker Street to the Super Highway|newspaper=London Evening Standard|date=24 November 2000}}</ref>

Rafferty maintained his enthusiasm for this new approach to recording for the next three years. In a blog posting dated 31 March 2004 he wrote: "Let's get back to music: after all that's the only reason that this website has been set up." Another posting announced that Rafferty would begin to release music regularly as free downloads: "In reality, Gerry could put a new track out every two weeks or so. We will keep you informed of developments as they happen."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gerryrafferty.com/index.cfm?go=biography.part1 |title=News section postings dated 23 February 2004 and 31 March 2004 |access-date=14 September 2017 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041023060155/http://www.gerryrafferty.com/index.cfm?go=biography.part1 |archive-date=23 October 2004 |df=dmy-all }}, Retrieved from Wayback Machine archive of www.gerryrafferty.com, 21 February 2011</ref> Only a handful of tracks were ever released, however, and the website eventually closed down without any explanation.

===''Life Goes On''===
During November 2009, Rafferty released what would be his final album, ''[[Life Goes On (Gerry Rafferty album)|Life Goes On]]''. This was again on the Hypertension music label. Featuring 18 tracks, the album contains six new recordings, covers of Christmas carols, plus also some traditional songs that had previously been available on the Gerry Rafferty website. The remaining tracks are remastered tracks from his previous three albums.<ref name="lgo" />

===Posthumous releases===
Rafferty's death in January 2011 rekindled interest in the singer's work. His daughter Martha relaunched Rafferty's old website, gerryrafferty.com, with a full discography, rare photos, and new artwork by John 'Patrick' Byrne. She portrayed her father as an [[autodidact]] with an "incredibly strong work ethic" and passion for books ("There were literally whole walls of book shelves at home and he'd read every single word. Mainly philosophy, art, religion, psychology and many a biography.").<ref name=martharaffbiog/>

In September 2011, EMI issued a remastered collector's edition of ''City to City'' featuring previously unheard demo versions of "Baker Street", "Mattie's Rag", "City to City", and other tracks from the album.

Other artists continue to be inspired by Rafferty's work. In 2012, Cuillin Recordings issued ''Paisley Spin'', a remix of three tracks from ''Can I Have My Money Back?'' by [[Celtic fusion]] artist [[Martyn Bennett]]. [[Bonnie Raitt]] recorded a reggae treatment of "Right Down the Line" for her ''Slipstream'' album released 10 April 2012. [[Barbara Dickson]] released a tribute album of 13 Rafferty songs, ''To Each and Everyone: The Songs of Gerry Rafferty'', in September 2013, including cover versions of "Baker Street", "The Ark", and "Steamboat Row".<ref name=folkwords2013>{{cite web|last=Carroll|first=Tim|title=Interview with Barbara Dickson|url=http://www.folkwords.com/interviewdickson.html|work=FolkWords|access-date=8 December 2013|archive-date=12 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212011131/http://www.folkwords.com/interviewdickson.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 3 September 2021 Parlophone UK released "Rest In Blue" an album on which Martha Rafferty completed a project started by her father from demos left by Rafferty. The collection of blues, rock, and folk demos had been planned for a new album before his death.

==Attitude toward the music industry==
Rafferty drew a clear distinction between the artistic integrity of a musician, on the one hand, and the music industry's need to create celebrities and sell products, on the other. In an interview with Colin Irwin in 1988, he said: "There's a thin line between being a songwriter and a singer and being a personality... If you feel uncomfortable with it you shouldn't do it. It's not for me – there are too many inherent contradictions."<ref name="irwin">[http://www.redstone-tech.com/gerry_bsb/folk_roots_1988.htm Gerry Rafferty Interview by Colin Irwin] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715165702/http://www.redstone-tech.com/gerry_bsb/folk_roots_1988.htm |date=15 July 2011 }}, Folk Roots, 1988</ref> Two decades later, speaking to the press after Rafferty's funeral, Charlie Reid of The Proclaimers confirmed Rafferty's dislike of celebrity: "He was not entirely comfortable with fame. Even more so than most people who work in this business, he saw it as not a good thing."<ref name="bbcfuneral">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-12246356 Gerry Rafferty's funeral is held in Paisley] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181203114406/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-12246356 |date=3 December 2018 }}, BBC News, 21 January 2011.</ref> Reid believed Rafferty was fundamentally unsuited to the pressures of celebrity: "He struck me as a very, very sensitive man and for someone like that, fame was probably not appropriate."<ref name="telefuneral">[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/8273339/Mourners-pay-tribute-to-Gerry-Rafferty.html Mourners pay tribute to Gerry Rafferty] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181118131524/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/8273339/Mourners-pay-tribute-to-Gerry-Rafferty.html |date=18 November 2018 }}, 'The Daily Telegraph'' (London), 21 January 2011.</ref> Billy Connolly agrees that Rafferty had different priorities: "I wanted success and fame and I got it, to a degree. Gerry wanted respect. He wanted his talent to be respected. He wanted his songs to be respected. And he certainly got that."<ref name=rightdowntheline/>

Generally an autobiographical writer,<ref name="paisleyde" /> Rafferty returned to this theme often, in the lyrics of Stealers Wheel songs such as "Stuck in the Middle With You" and "Good Businessman", and later solo tracks like "Take the Money and Run" (from ''[[Night Owl (album)|Night Owl]]''), "Welcome to Hollywood" (from ''[[Snakes and Ladders (Gerry Rafferty album)|Snakes and Ladders]]''), and "Sleepwalking" (from [[Sleepwalking (Gerry Rafferty album)|the album of the same name]]). The liner notes to the compilation album ''Right Down the Line'', written by Jerry Gilbert with Rafferty's close co-operation, note his consistent refusal to tour the United States and "generally 'play the industry game'."<ref name="gilbert">{{cite web |url=http://www.gerryrafferty.com/index.cfm?go=biography.part1 |title=Gerry Rafferty Biography: 'Right Down the Line' Liner Notes |access-date=14 September 2017 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041023060155/http://www.gerryrafferty.com/index.cfm?go=biography.part1 |archive-date=23 October 2004 |df=dmy-all }}, Retrieved from Wayback Machine archive of www.gerryrafferty.com, 21 February 2011</ref> It was ironic that Rafferty—a lover and collector of religious [[icon]]s, who would later name one of his publishing companies "Icon Music"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gerryrafferty.com/index.cfm?go=gallery.main&catID=3 |title='Icon Gallery' introductory notes by Gerry Rafferty |access-date=14 September 2017 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041211054150/http://www.gerryrafferty.com/index.cfm?go=gallery.main&catID=3 |archive-date=11 December 2004 |df=dmy-all }}, Retrieved from Wayback Machine archive of www.gerryrafferty.com, 21 February 2011</ref>—was also an [[Iconoclasm|iconoclast]].<ref name="gilbert" /> According to Michael Gray, Rafferty's personal manager at the height of his success, he turned down many opportunities to work with other artists:<ref name="gray1">[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jan/04/gerry-rafferty-obituary Gerry Rafferty Obituary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190411103205/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jan/04/gerry-rafferty-obituary |date=11 April 2019 }}, Michael Gray, 4 January 2011</ref> "... he retained a healthy scepticism not just about the music industry but about society, money and politics in general.

Rafferty never changed his mind about the music business; if anything, his views hardened. In 2000, he told the ''[[Paisley Daily Express]]'' that the second Stealers Wheel album, released in 1974, had been named ''Ferguslie Park'', after a deprived<ref name="bbcferguslie">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6058524.stm Study shows 'most deprived' areas] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105093115/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6058524.stm |date=5 January 2008 }} BBC News, 17 October 2006</ref> area of Paisley, "to get as far away as possible from all the bullshit of the music industry in London."<ref name="paisleyde" /> Monsignor John Tormey, celebrating Rafferty's funeral mass, suggested the singer's attitude to fame was an indication of his spiritual integrity: "He always searched for a more authentic way to live his life, shunning the outward trappings of celebrity so that he might live as he chose to live his life."<ref name="bbcfuneral" />

==Personal life==
[[File:Entrance to Eaglestone House (geograph 6397480).jpg|thumb|Eaglestone House in Strathpeffer]]
In 1965, 18-year-old Rafferty met 15-year-old Carla Ventilla, an apprentice hairdresser from an Italian family in [[Clydebank]], at a dancehall—a story he later recounted in the song "Shipyard Town" on ''North and South''. They married in 1970 and lived in [[Scotland]] with their daughter, Martha Mary, before moving to the south of England in the late 1970s,<ref name="melodymaker"/> where they divided their time between their farm near the [[Kent]]–[[Sussex]] border and a home in [[Hampstead]], London.<ref name="gray1" /> Rafferty's lengthy commutes from London to Scotland inspired some songs on the album ''City to City'' (including the title track and "Mattie's Rag", which recounted his delight at being reunited with his daughter), while the later move south inspired "The Garden of England" (from the album ''[[Snakes and Ladders (Gerry Rafferty album)|Snakes and Ladders]]'') and some songs on ''North and South''. Rafferty and Ventilla divorced in 1990.

After the completion of ''[[Another World (Gerry Rafferty album)|Another World]]'' in 2000, Rafferty planned to move back to Scotland and bought Eaglestone House,<ref>{{cite news|last=Dawson|first=Tim|title=Gerry Rafferty – Moving On|newspaper=The Sunday Times|date=2 January 2005|page=2}}</ref> "a substantial listed 1860s mansion" in the [[Highland (council area)|Highland]] village of [[Strathpeffer]],<ref name=robertson>{{cite news|last=Robertson|first=Alastair|title=Baker Street to easy street|url=http://property.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/property/article1054436.ece|access-date=24 September 2011|newspaper=The Times|location=London|date=4 April 2004|archive-date=14 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210314152717/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/|url-status=live}}</ref> although he sold the property two years later and never actually moved in.<ref name=pdavison>{{cite news|last=Davison|first=Phil|title=Obituary: Gerry Rafferty, singer and songwriter|url=http://news.scotsman.com/obituaries/Obituary-Gerry-Rafferty-singer-and.6681050.jp|access-date=24 September 2011|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=6 January 2011|location=Edinburgh|archive-date=9 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109010827/http://news.scotsman.com/obituaries/Obituary-Gerry-Rafferty-singer-and.6681050.jp|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Alcoholism===
Rafferty enjoyed alcohol from a young age,<ref name="melodymaker" /><ref name=hartfield /><ref name=rightdowntheline /><ref name="enzina2"/> and early songs, such as "One Drink Down", "Baker Street", and "Night Owl", freely mention the subject. According to Michael Gray, the singer's personal manager in the early 1980s: "It never occurred to me in all the time I knew him that he was heading for alcoholism. Maybe I should have realised, but I didn't. I'm unsure whether he did."<ref name="gray2" /> As the 1980s progressed, Rafferty's growing drinking problem placed his marriage under impossible strain<ref name="gray1" /> and his wife divorced him in 1990,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/473786/gerry-rafferty-baker-street-singer-dies-at-63 |title=Gerry Rafferty, 'Baker Street' Singer, Dies at 63 |work=Billboard |access-date=5 January 2011 |archive-date=23 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823133100/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/473786/gerry-rafferty-baker-street-singer-dies-at-63 |url-status=live }}</ref> though they remained close.<ref name="gray1" /> In the late 1980s, Rafferty had told journalist Colin Irwin "I was always very conscious about keeping a low profile because that's the way I like to go about it. And I don't plan to be in the public eye too much now either."<ref name="irwin" />

In 1995, Rafferty was deeply affected by the death of his older brother Joseph, an event from which family and friends said he never fully recovered.<ref name="enzina2" />

In the last decade of his life, having taken pains to shun the fame and celebrity that accompanied his musical achievements, Rafferty found himself making headlines once again as he struggled with alcoholism and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and the increasingly erratic behaviour they spawned.<ref name="nyt">{{cite news |last=Martin |first=Douglas |date=4 January 2011 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/05/arts/music/05rafferty.html |title=Gerry Rafferty, songwriter, Dies at 63 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=6 January 2011 |archive-date=30 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430083252/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/05/arts/music/05rafferty.html |url-status=live }}</ref> While the news stories focused on Rafferty's binges, they revealed nothing of the impact on his family and friends. His girlfriend Enzina Fuschini said she "felt that he was under some sort of evil spell. He felt crippled by it... I saw a man in despair".<ref name="enzina2" /> According to Rafferty's ex-wife Carla: "There was no hope. I would never have left him if there'd been a glimmer of a chance of him recovering."<ref name="gray1" />

===Disappearance===
In 2008, Rafferty moved away from [[California]] and briefly rented a home in Ireland, where his drinking soon became a problem again.<ref name="gray1" /> In July that year, he flew to London, where he stayed in the five-star Westbury Hotel in [[Mayfair]] and began a four-day drinking binge during which he extensively damaged his room. Speaking to ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper later, the hotel's director commented: "It was such a shame. In person, Mr Rafferty was a really nice man, he kept himself to himself and didn't bother the other guests but he was clearly on a downward spiral. He was in self-destruct mode."<ref name="skidrow">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/the-lonely-road-from-baker-street-to-skid-row-1623805.html |location=London |newspaper=[[The Independent]]|title=The lonely road from 'Baker Street' to skid row |date=17 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220184729/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/the-lonely-road-from-baker-street-to-skid-row-1623805.html |archive-date=20 February 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/andrewmcfbrown/100070519/gerry-raffertys-struggle-with-demons-and-the-willie-whitelaw-connection/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304134536/http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/andrewmcfbrown/100070519/gerry-raffertys-struggle-with-demons-and-the-willie-whitelaw-connection/ |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

There were conflicting reports about what happened next. The newspaper ''[[Scotland on Sunday]]'' reported that Rafferty had been asked to leave the hotel and had then checked himself into [[St Thomas' Hospital]] suffering from a chronic liver condition, brought on by heavy drinking. The same report claimed that on 1 August 2008, Rafferty had disappeared, leaving his belongings behind, and that the hospital had filed a missing persons report.<ref name="sos"/> No such missing persons report existed.<ref name="skidrow" />

On 17 February 2009, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that Rafferty was in hiding in the south of England, being cared for by a friend.<ref name=Gillan>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/feb/17/gerry-rafferty-in-hiding|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Audrey|last=Gillan|title=Missing Baker Street singer Gerry Rafferty is living in hiding|date=17 February 2009|location=London|access-date=14 December 2016|archive-date=27 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927185000/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/feb/17/gerry-rafferty-in-hiding|url-status=live}}</ref> Subsequently, Rafferty's spokesperson Paul Charles told ''The Independent'' that he had been in touch with Rafferty a fortnight previously and that he was alive and well but had no plans to either record or tour.<ref name=Gillan/> This was contradicted by a report in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' on the following day, which quoted a statement his solicitors made to [[Channel 4]] News: "Contrary to reports, Gerry is extremely well and has been living in Tuscany for the last six months... he continues to compose and record new songs and music... and he hopes to release a new album of his most recent work in the summer of this year [2009]."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/4683901/Gerry-Rafferty-happily-stuck-in-the-middle-of-Tuscany.html|location=London|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|first=Sarah|last=Knapton|title=Gerry Rafferty happily stuck in the middle of Tuscany|date=18 February 2009|access-date=2 April 2018|archive-date=28 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128174816/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/4683901/Gerry-Rafferty-happily-stuck-in-the-middle-of-Tuscany.html|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7896777.stm|work=BBC News|title='Missing' singer Rafferty is fine|date=18 February 2009|access-date=9 March 2009|archive-date=21 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221211255/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7896777.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> The album, titled ''Life Goes On'', was released in November 2009.<ref name="lgo">{{Cite web|url=https://hypertension-music.online-ticket.de/|title=Tickets & Eintrittskarten online kaufen &#124; Hypertension Music|website=Hypertension-music.online-ticket.de|access-date=3 October 2019|archive-date=4 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191004191234/https://hypertension-music.online-ticket.de/|url-status=live}}</ref>

After leaving St Thomas' Hospital, and while claiming he was in [[Tuscany]], he was moving from one London hotel to another. During this time, he met Enzina Fuschini, an Italian artist living in [[Dorset]]. Rafferty and Fuschini rented a large home together in [[Upton, Dorset|Upton]], near [[Poole]].<ref name="enzina3">[http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/8629389.Neighbours_of_Baker_Street_star_Gerry_Rafferty_speak_of_shock_at_his_collapse/ Neighbours of Baker Street star Gerry Rafferty speak of shock at his collapse] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929133532/http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/8629389.Neighbours_of_Baker_Street_star_Gerry_Rafferty_speak_of_shock_at_his_collapse/ |date=29 September 2012 }}, ''Bournemouth Echo'', 11 November 2010.</ref> Fuschini claims she cared for the singer during 2009 and tried to help him overcome his alcoholism, and that he proposed to her at the [[Hotel Ritz Paris|Ritz Hotel]] in Paris on Christmas Eve that year.<ref name="enzina2">[http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/8830312._I_lost_my_soulmate__says_Baker_Street_fiancee/ 'I lost my soulmate' says Gerry Rafferty's fiancee] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929133557/http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/8830312._I_lost_my_soulmate__says_Baker_Street_fiancee/ |date=29 September 2012 }}, ''Bournemouth Echo'', 3 February 2011.</ref>

==Death==
In November 2010, Rafferty was admitted to the [[Royal Bournemouth Hospital]] where he was put on a life-support machine and treated for multiple organ failure. After being taken off life support, Rafferty rallied for a short time, and doctors thought that he might recover.<ref>[http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/hope-for-family-as-rafferty-is-taken-off-life-support-machine-1.1067866 Hope for family as Rafferty is taken off life support machine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215202632/http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/hope-for-family-as-rafferty-is-taken-off-life-support-machine-1.1067866 |date=15 December 2010 }} by Brian Donnelly, ''The Herald'' (Glasgow), 12 November 2010</ref> Rafferty died of liver failure at the home of his daughter Martha in [[Stroud]], Gloucestershire, on 4 January 2011.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/8274804/Gerry-Raffertys-daughter-sings-at-his-funeral.html |title=Gerry Rafferty's daughter sings at his funeral |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=21 January 2011 |location=London |date=21 January 2011 |archive-date=22 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222195019/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/8274804/Gerry-Raffertys-daughter-sings-at-his-funeral.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stroudnewsandjournal.co.uk/news/8809078.Baker_Street_singer_Gerry_Rafferty_died_at_daughter_s_Stroud_home/ |title=Baker Street singer Gerry Rafferty died at his daughter's home in Stroud |website=Stroudnewsandjournal.co.uk |access-date=29 January 2011 |archive-date=20 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120104604/http://www.stroudnewsandjournal.co.uk/news/8809078.Baker_Street_singer_Gerry_Rafferty_died_at_daughter_s_Stroud_home/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

A [[requiem mass]] was held for Rafferty at [[St Mirin's Cathedral]] in his native town of [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]] on 21 January 2011. The mass was streamed live over the Internet. Politicians in attendance were the [[First Minister of Scotland]] [[Alex Salmond]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]], [[Wendy Alexander]] MSP, [[Hugh Henry]] MSP, and [[Robin Harper]] MSP. The musicians present included Craig and Charlie Reid of [[The Proclaimers]], former bandmates [[Joe Egan (musician)|Joe Egan]] and [[Rab Noakes]], [[Barbara Dickson]], and [[Graham Lyle]].

===Will and legal dispute over estate===
In October 2011, newspapers reported that Rafferty's immediate family were the beneficiaries of his £1.25&nbsp;million estate. Rafferty had apparently not changed his will after meeting Enzina Fuschini in 2008 and left her nothing. It was later reported that Fuschini had lost her case and £75,000 legal costs were awarded against her.<ref name=sarahcoles>{{cite news|last=Coles|first=Sarah|title=Gerry Rafferty's girlfriend loses battle for inheritance|url=http://money.aol.co.uk/2012/10/24/gerry-raffertys-girlfriend-loses-battle-for-inheritance/|access-date=26 October 2012|website=Money.aol.co.uk|date=24 October 2012|archive-date=25 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025234805/http://money.aol.co.uk/2012/10/24/gerry-raffertys-girlfriend-loses-battle-for-inheritance/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Tributes and legacy==
Newspapers printed lengthy obituaries for the singer; in ''[[The Guardian]]'', Michael Gray charted Rafferty's long downward spiral into alcoholism,<ref name="gray1" /> while a full-page obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' summarised his career more positively: "As well as being a singer of considerable talent who at one time had the pop world at his feet, Gerry Rafferty was also a consummate songwriter, blessed with sensitivity and an enviable melodic flair that at its best recalled [[Paul McCartney]]."<ref>Obituary, Gerry Rafferty. The Times, Wednesday 5 January 2011.</ref>

Other entertainers also paid tribute to Rafferty, with comedian and ex-bandmate Billy Connolly calling him "a hugely talented songwriter and singer who will be greatly missed" and musician [[Tom Robinson]] saying, "His early work with Stealers Wheel was an inspiration to a whole generation of songwriters in the 70s, including me."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-12115604 |title=Baker Street singer Gerry Rafferty dies at age of 63 |publisher=BBC |access-date=6 January 2011 |date=5 January 2011 |archive-date=6 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106004438/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-12115604 |url-status=live }}</ref> Speaking after the funeral, Charlie Reid of The Proclaimers said: "I think Gerry Rafferty was one of the few people who really successfully straddled the worlds of both folk and popular music. He did it really well and he was respected in both camps."<ref name="telefuneral" /> Barbara Dickson also paid tribute to her friend, whom she described as a "luminous, glorious Scottish musician".<ref name="kilbride">[http://news.stv.tv/scotland/west-central/218374-tributes-paid-to-gerry-rafferty/ Tributes paid to Gerry Rafferty] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210134609/http://news.stv.tv/scotland/west-central/218374-tributes-paid-to-gerry-rafferty/ |date=10 February 2011 }} by John Kilbride, STV, 5 January 2011</ref> [[Finbar Furey]], who knew Rafferty for over 40 years, said he "was in a different league completely. He didn't know how good he was. He was one of the most talented musicians and singers I ever knew but he completely underestimated his own talent. He was a very humble man."<ref name=finbarfurey>{{cite news|last=McCárthaigh|first=Seán|title=Finbar Furey leads tributes to the late singer-songwriter Gerry Rafferty|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/kfeykfcwgbsn/rss2/|access-date=24 October 2012|newspaper=Irish Examiner|date=6 January 2011|archive-date=22 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322080623/http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/kfeykfcwgbsn/rss2/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The reaction of younger artists suggests Rafferty's music has also inspired a new generation of fans. Shortly after news of the singer's death, [[Lily Allen]] tweeted the message "Rest in Peace Gerry x" with a video link to the song, "Right Down the Line", reputedly one of her favourite music tracks.<ref name="laroux">[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/apr/25/la-roux-soundtrack-of-life La Roux: Soundtrack of My Life] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312123421/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/apr/25/la-roux-soundtrack-of-life |date=12 March 2016 }} by Gareth Grundy, ''The Guardian'', 25 April 2010</ref> Electropop star [[Elly Jackson]] described "Right Down the Line" as "my favourite track of all time. It makes me think of home, nostalgia and happiness."<ref name="laroux" />

In November 2012, Rafferty's hometown of Paisley paid tribute to the singer by naming a street in the Shortroods area "Gerry Rafferty Drive". Gordon Laurie, director of the [[housing association]] behind the project, commented: "It is a fitting tribute to a brilliant musician who lives on through his music."<ref name=grdrive>{{cite news|title=Star tribute as Gerry Rafferty Drive opens|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/star-tribute-as-gerry-rafferty-drive-opens.1353592907|access-date=6 January 2013|newspaper=The Herald|location=Glasgow|date=22 November 2012|archive-date=14 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210314152703/https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13081955.star-tribute-as-gerry-rafferty-drive-opens/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In January 2013, [[BBC Radio 2]] re-broadcast "Bring It All Home – Gerry Rafferty Remembered", which had been recorded live at [[Celtic Connections]] 2012 in Glasgow and was presented by [[Ricky Ross (musician)|Ricky Ross]]. The commemorative show, recorded one year after Rafferty's death, had first been broadcast in February 2012. Contributing artists included his friend Rab Noakes, The Proclaimers, Barbara Dickson, [[Ron Sexsmith]], [[Jack Bruce]], [[Paul Brady]], [[Emma Pollock]], [[James Vincent McMorrow]] and [[Betsy Cook]]. Three of Rafferty's regular support musicians, guitarist Hugh Burns, multi-instrumentalist {{interlanguage link|Graham Preskett|fr}} and saxophonist [[Mel Collins]], were also featured.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01bwbqq |title=Bring It All Home – Gerry Rafferty Remembered |access-date=17 January 2013 |archive-date=30 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430090838/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01bwbqq |url-status=live }}</ref>
