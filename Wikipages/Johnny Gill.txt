==Music career==
{{Moresources|section|date=November 2021}}
===Early career===
Gill's recording career began in 1982, at the age of 16, when his childhood friend [[Stacy Lattisaw]] convinced him to record a demo. This demo fell into the hands of the president of [[Atlantic Records]], and his first [[Johnny Gill (1983 album)|self-titled debut album]] was released shortly thereafter on Atlantic subsidiary [[Cotillion Records]].<ref name="Larkin80"/> Gill then teamed up with Stacy for the duet album ''[[Perfect Combination]]''. A second solo album on Cotillion Records, ''[[Chemistry (Johnny Gill album)|Chemistry]]'', was released in 1985.<ref name="Larkin80"/>

===New Edition===
Gill began a new chapter in his career in 1987, when he was recruited by [[Michael Bivins]] to join [[New Edition]].<ref name="Larkin80"/> Bobby Brown had been voted out of the group and Gill was brought in to replace lead singer [[Ralph Tresvant]], who was rumored at the time to be leaving to pursue a solo career. Gill became the only member of New Edition who was not from [[Boston]]. With Gill, the oldest member, as one of the lead singers (along with Tresvant, who ended up staying with New Edition and delaying the launch of his solo career) on the album ''[[Heart Break]]'', the group developed a more mature, adult sound, hitting the charts with songs such as "Can You Stand The Rain", "N.E. Heartbreak", "If It Isn't Love", and the Gill-led "Boys To Men".

===Solo career===
Continuing his role as a romantic balladeer while emerging as a [[new jack swing]] star, he released a [[Johnny Gill (1990 album)|self-titled third album]] in 1990, which included the hits "[[My, My, My]]", "[[Rub You the Right Way]]", "Fairweather Friend", and "[[Wrap My Body Tight]]".<ref name="Larkin80"/>

In 1993, Gill released another solo project, ''[[Provocative (album)|Provocative]]'',<ref name="Larkin80"/> which included the songs "Quiet Time to Play", "A Cute, Sweet, Love Addiction", and the gospel song, "I Know Where I Stand".

In 1996, Gill released ''[[Let's Get the Mood Right]]'', which included the title song, "Love In an Elevator", and the single "Maybe". In 1996, Johnny reunited with New Edition and recorded the album ''[[Home Again (New Edition album)|Home Again]]''.

===LSG===
In 1997, he collaborated with [[Gerald Levert]] and [[Keith Sweat]] to form the [[supergroup (bands)|supergroup]] ''[[LSG (band)|LSG]]'' (Levert/Sweat/Gill),<ref name="Larkin80"/> which yielded the multi- platinum debut album, ''[[Levert.Sweat.Gill]]'', and their final album ''LSG2'' in 2003. In 2004, he reunited with New Edition; they signed with Bad Boy Records and released the album ''One Love'' which included the single "Hot 2Nite" in 2004.

===Return to solo career===
16 years after recording his last solo album, Gill returned with ''Still Winning'', which included "In The Mood", "Just The Way You Are", "It Would Be You", and "2nd Place". In 2014 Gill left Fontana Records and started his own label, J Skillz Records, on which he released a new album called ''Game Changer''. The album produced several adult R&B radio hits, including the singles "Behind Closed Doors" and the title track, "Game Changer". His New Edition bandmates appear on "This One's For Me And You". Gill joined Fantasia as an opener for Charlie Wilson's In It To Win It tour, which kicked off in February 2017.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Penrose|first1=Nerisha|title=Where are the Six Members of New Edition Now?|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7669914/new-edition-members-where-are-they-now|website=Billboard.com|access-date=February 6, 2017}}</ref> On September 6, 2019, Gill released his album ''Game Changer 2''.
