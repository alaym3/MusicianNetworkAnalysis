'''José Fernando Suárez''' (born October 15, 1980),{{cn|date=May 2021}} known professionally as '''Cosculluela''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/cosculluela-mn0001496816/biography|title=Cosculluela {{!}} Biography & History|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=April 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103133841/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/cosculluela-mn0001496816/biography|archive-date=January 3, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> is a Puerto Rican rapper, singer and songwriter. In 2018, he was caught up in a controversy after fellow Puerto Rican rapper [[Anuel AA]] released a [[Diss (music)|diss track]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8474986/anuel-aa-apologizes-offensive-song-cosculluela|title=Anuel AA Apologizes For Offensive Song Directed at Cosculluela: Watch|website=Billboard|access-date=April 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190503080315/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8474986/anuel-aa-apologizes-offensive-song-cosculluela|archive-date=May 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Cosculluela was born to a Cuban father and a Puerto Rican mother. He came from an upper-class family and was raised in the [[gated community]] of [[Palmas del Mar]]. At a young age, Cosculluela became interested in tennis and eventually played for his high school, ''Colegio San Antonio Abad.'' He also developed passions for golf and surfing.

== Career ==
At the age of sixteen, Cosculluela began producing [[Mixtape|underground mixtapes]] with his brother Jaime and his friends. After a few years of recording underground, popular [[Reggaeton]] producer Buddha found out about Cosculluela's talents in a [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] studio. Buddha was working with Latin hip hop producer Echo at the time. Buddha selected Cosculluela to replace rapper Tempo in the hip hop group Buddha's Family. Echo eventually signed Cosculluela to his label, Invasion Music.

Cosculluela gained international recognition with the hit single "Te Va Ir Mal" (feat. Getto) from the album [[Buddha's Family 2: Desde La Prisión|''Buddha's'' ''Family'' ''2'']] distributed by [[Machete Music]]/[[Universal Latino]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/buddhas-family-vol-2-desde-la-prision-mw0000333960|title=Buddha's Family, Vol. 2: Desde la Prision – Various Artists – Songs, Reviews, Credits|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=January 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103133844/https://www.allmusic.com/album/buddhas-family-vol-2-desde-la-prision-mw0000333960|archive-date=January 3, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Soon after, Cosculluela began working with famed producers ''Gocho'' and [[Alex Gárgolas|Alex Gargolas]] for multiple compilation albums. He also released a reworked version of his classic mixtape, ''"Este Es Mi Momento",'' in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYQy9qvfCdw|title=Cosculluela – Este es mi momento (Full Álbum) (2006)|last=Chuppe Mix|date=January 26, 2015|via=YouTube}}</ref>

After this, Cosculluela moved up in the ranks of [[reggaeton]], appearing on such albums as ''[[Los Bandoleros Reloaded]]'', ''Invasion'', ''Gargolas'', ''Los'' ''Bravos'', ''[[El Pentágono]]'', ''[[El Pentágono: The Return]], Los Brother'', ''[[Talento de Barrio]]'', and many more. Cosculluela is known to many as "''El Principe del Verso''" (''The Prince of Verse'') because of his exceptional lyrical abilities as an [[Master of ceremonies|MC]].

[[Echo (producer)|Echo]] was unable to get [[Universal Latino]] to release an album from any of his artists and only saw his compilation album "''Invasion vol. 1''" distributed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/echo-presenta-invasion-mw0000474494|title=Echo Presenta: Invasion – Various Artists – Songs, Reviews, Credits|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=January 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201035358/https://www.allmusic.com/album/echo-presenta-invasion-mw0000474494|archive-date=December 1, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> This caused Cosculluela to leave Invasion in 2007 and sign a recording contract with the renowned executive producer ''Elias De León'' and his influential record label [[White Lion Records]]. After struggling with record executives to set a release for his debut album, which was originally meant to be distributed on [[Sony Music Latin|Sony Latin]], and after various delays in 2009, [[Machete Music]] was pressured into releasing Cosculluela's hit debut album, "[[El Principe (album)|El Principe]]" (The Prince). It was released thanks to Cosculluela's friendship with [[Wisin y Yandel]], who had a partnership with [[Universal Latino]] for their record label [[WY Records]] and were very influential at the company due to their immense success and popularity.

===''El Príncipe''===
In 2009, Cosculluela released his first album, [[El Príncipe (Cosculluela album)|''El Príncipe'']]. The album was announced a year earlier and it was named after one of his nicknames. .<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/el-principe-mw0000834956|title=El Principe – Cosculluela – Songs, Reviews, Credits|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=January 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103193522/https://www.allmusic.com/album/el-principe-mw0000834956|archive-date=January 3, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It peaked at number three on the [[Top Latin Albums|''Billboard'' Top Latin Albums]] chart and spawned the hit singles "''Na Na Nau''", "''Prrrum''", and "''Plaka Plaka''".<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=cosculluela|chart=Latin Albums}}|title=Cosculluela – Chart History: Top Latin Albums|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=June 13, 2013}}</ref> It also reached number eight on the [[Rap Albums|''Billboard'' Rap Albums]] chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/299677/cosculluela/chart?f=3350|title=Cosculluela – Chart History: Rap Albums|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=June 13, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803210307/http://www.billboard.com/artist/299677/cosculluela/chart?f=3350|archive-date=August 3, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> A few tracks were left out of the final production. ''El Principe'' was one of the most successful [[reggaeton]] albums of the year, becoming ''critically acclaimed'' due to its diversity in lyrics and style.

===''El Principe: Ghost Edition''===
In 2010, Cosculluela released his first album called ''El Principe: Ghost Edition''. This album was a review of his first album, but with 5 new tracks. These 5 tracks were Cuidau Au Au, Humo, Prrrum Remix ft. Nardo Ranks, and Another Prrrum Remix. They were performed with [[Wisin & Yandel]], and the last track was De Noche y De Dia feat. [[Yandel]].

===''El Niño''===
{{main|Cosculluela: El Niño}}
''El Niño'' comes with many romantic, hip hop and reggaeton lyrics. Collaborations that have been announced so far are [[Wisin & Yandel]] and Los Mafiaboyz. Two singles have been released so far, they are: "Blam Blam" and "Si Tú No Estás." The remix of "Si Tú No Estás" will feature Puerto Rican artist [[Farruko]], Colombian sensation [[J Balvin|J-Balvin]] and the duo [[Ñejo & Dalmata]].

=== War Kingz (2012) ===
''War Kingz'' is the name of Cosculluela's first mixtape, which came out on December 11, 2012. This album helped new talents within the artist's company to apply themselves within the urban environment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/es/Cosculluela-War-Kingz/release/14353932|title=Cosculluela - War Kingz|access-date=June 9, 2020|website=Discogs|language=es}}</ref>

===''Blanco Perla''===

In 2014 Cosculluela left Universal Latino which lead to a bidding war among Latin labels to sign him, thanks to his success and much-publicized rap battle against Tempo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/cosculluela|title=Cosculluela BlancoPerla Chart History|website=Billboard|access-date=January 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119030852/http://www.billboard.com/music/cosculluela|archive-date=November 19, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Warner Music Latina]] won the right to distribute Cosculluela's works through his Rottweilas Inc imprint and immediately began work on his latest album "Blanco Perla".  Cosculluela released the hit single "Baby Boo" featuring renowned hitmakers [[Wise (composer)|Wise "The Gold Pen"]] and DJ Luian<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/dj-luian-mn0002600439/songs|title=DJ Luian – Songs|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=January 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103193528/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/dj-luian-mn0002600439/songs|archive-date=January 3, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> to prepare for his upcoming release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/search/charts?f%5B0%5D=ss_chart_search_title:%22Baby+Boo%22&f%5B1%5D=itm_field_chart_id:403&refine=1|title=Chart Search – Billboard|website=Billboard}}</ref>

Although he began 2015 with a domestic violence charge, he otherwise enjoyed major success that year. He released the smash hit "Te Busco" with [[Nicky Jam]], the first single from his album ''Blanco Perla''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/te-busco-mw0002886817|title=Te Busco – Cosculluela – Songs, Reviews, Credits|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=January 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103193513/https://www.allmusic.com/album/te-busco-mw0002886817|archive-date=January 3, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In October 2016, he released the album, which features major hits such as "Te Busco", "Manicomio", and "La Boda", the latter of which is about his wedding, which occurred in November 2015; it features singer O'Neill as well as an intro by rapper [[Kendo Kaponi]]. The album also features collaborations with artists such as [[Daddy Yankee]], [[Nicky Jam]], [[Farruko]], [[Arcángel (singer)|Arcangel]], [[De La Ghetto]], and [[Tempo (rapper)|Tempo]].

Blanco Perla remains Cosculluela's most notable work in terms of popularity as the artist decided to leave behind his hardcore [[hip hop]] roots in favour of the modern mainstream [[reggaeton]] sound of artists such as [[J Balvin]] and [[Nicky Jam]].  Hit singles from the album such as "Te Busco" feat. Nicky Jam, Manicomio, "La Boda", and "A Donde Voy" featuring Daddy Yankee have garnered hundreds of millions of plays through various streaming platforms and become some of the most well-known songs of Cosculluela's catalogue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/cosculluela|title=Cosculluela Te Busco Chart History|website=Billboard|access-date=January 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119030852/http://www.billboard.com/music/cosculluela|archive-date=November 19, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/cosculluela|title=Cosculluela Manicomio Chart History|website=Billboard|access-date=January 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119030852/http://www.billboard.com/music/cosculluela|archive-date=November 19, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sosF0xP57HE|title=Cosculluela – Manicomio [Video Oficial]|last=Cosculluela El Principe|date=October 14, 2016|via=YouTube|access-date=January 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180405085726/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sosF0xP57HE|archive-date=April 5, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

===2021===

In November 2021, Coscullela signed an exclusive deal with [[ONErpm]]. The contract is also in partnership with his longtime label Rottweilas, Inc.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Roiz|first=Jessica|title=Cosculluela Inks Exclusive Deal with ONErpm|url=https://www.power991fm.com/2021/11/23/cosculluela-inks-exclusive-deal-with-onerpm/|date=November 23, 2021|access-date=November 23, 2021|website=power99.1FM}}</ref>

==Controversy==
On September 15, 2018, [[Anuel AA]] released a [[Diss (music)|diss track]] aimed at Cosculluela. The track was widely criticized due to its foul language and offensive remarks about homosexuality and HIV patients.<ref name="Billboard1">{{cite news |last1=Fernandez |first1=Suzette |title=Anuel AA Apologizes For Offensive Song Directed at Cosculluela: Watch |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8474986/anuel-aa-apologizes-offensive-song-cosculluela |access-date=December 29, 2018 |date=September 13, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229171356/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8474986/anuel-aa-apologizes-offensive-song-cosculluela |archive-date=December 29, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Two years later, amid the George Floyd protests around the world, the urban artist expressed through Instagram Live that [[Afro-Puerto Ricans]] are not descendants of Africa.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jackson |first1=Jhoni |title=Cosculluela Suggests Black American Protestors "Kill Each Other," Goes on Racist Rant |url=https://remezcla.com/music/cosculluela-suggests-black-protestors-kill-each-other/ |access-date=June 7, 2020 |publisher=Remezcla |date=June 7, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200607183007/https://remezcla.com/music/cosculluela-suggests-black-protestors-kill-each-other/ |archive-date=June 7, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> This is contrary to the basic teachings of the Puerto Rican education system that educate on the history and colonization process of Puerto Rico which included the African slave trade that lasted almost 500 years, and the vast and evident African influence on Puerto Rican culture (along with European Spanish and indigenous Taíno influences). Although he did not clarify where he believed the Afro-Puerto Ricans are originally from, in his insulting expressions of June 7, 2020, he also called for Puerto Ricans to not join in on protests, calling the demonstrations a "crap that affects the economy". Later that day, the urban artist issued an apology.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=El Nuevo Día |title=Cosculluela pide disculpas por expresiones sobre manifestaciones antirracistas en Estados Unidos |url=https://www.elnuevodia.com/entretenimiento/farandula/nota/cosculluelapidedisculpasporexpresionesrelacionadasconlasmanifestacionesantirracistasenestadosunidos-2574206/ |access-date=June 7, 2020 |agency=GFR Media |date=June 7, 2020}}</ref>
