'''Young Marble Giants''' were a Welsh [[post-punk]] band formed in [[Cardiff]], Wales, in 1978. Their music was based around the vocals of [[Alison Statton]] along with the minimalist instrumentation of brothers Philip and Stuart Moxham. Their early sound was a sharp contrast with the more aggressive [[punk rock]] that dominated the underground at the time. Young Marble Giants released just one studio album, ''[[Colossal Youth]]'', in 1980. They also released two [[Extended play|EP]]s and recorded a [[John Peel]] session.

==History==
Young Marble Giants were formed from the ashes of 'True Wheel' which also included friends Matthew Davis and Louise Porter (later signed to EMI). Stuart Moxham wrote the majority of the band's songs. Their sound was characterised by Phil's prominent bass lines, Stuart's rhythm guitar (a [[Rickenbacker]] 425) and Galanti electric organ lines and Statton's vocals.<ref name="Larkinindie">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who’s Who of Indie and New Wave Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-579-4|page=319}}</ref> Stuart Moxham's girlfriend, Wendy Smith, lent Stuart the money to buy the Rickenbacker. Smith, an art student in Cardiff at the time the YMG's were forming, photographed the band's US tour, and also designed cover art for several singles and albums by [[Weekend (Welsh band)|Weekend]].

Very early in their existence, there was a fourth member of the band, Peter Joyce, who was a cousin of the Moxham brothers. Joyce was a telephone engineer and skilled at electronics, who had made his own synthesiser from a kit. It made sounds similar to [[Brian Eno|Eno]]'s synths in the early [[Roxy Music]] and [[Kraftwerk]], who employed similar 'low-tech/high-tech' electronics. The YMGs used tape recordings of Joyce's home-made drum machine, since they did not wish to have a drummer. They were also interested in effects devices such as [[ring modulator]]s and reverb units, with the emphasis always on simplicity.

Their first vinyl release was on the compilation LP ''Is The War Over?'' on Cardiff DIY label, Z Block Records, in October 1979. While signed to UK independent [[record label]], [[Rough Trade Records]] the YMGs released two EPs, ''Final Day'' and ''Testcard'', and an album, ''[[Colossal Youth]]''<ref name="Larkinindie"/> (a reference to the [[Archaic Greece|Early Greek]] '[[Kouros|Kouroi]]' marble statues, from which the YMGs took the inspiration for their name.) The artwork of the album was inspired by the Beatles album, ''[[With the Beatles]]''.

The band toured Europe and North America and played in Berlin, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Vancouver and New York. Touring companions included the band [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]]. In September 1980, they played the [[Music in Leeds#Gothic rock|Futurama 2 Festival]] in [[Leeds]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.concertarchives.org/concerts/futurama-2-festival-1980|title=09/13/1980: Futurama 2 Festival 1980 @ Queens Hall &#124; Concert Archives|website=Concertarchives.org}}</ref>

Musical influences included [[Brian Eno|Eno]], [[Kraftwerk]], [[Neil Young]], [[Lou Reed]], [[The Velvet Underground]], [[Roxy Music]], [[David Bowie]], [[Can (band)|Can]] and others. The band were acquainted with [[Scritti Politti]], the band of [[Cardiff]] native [[Scritti Politti|Green Gartside]], and signed to the same label, [[Rough Trade Records]]. It was revealed in the 2003 book ''Journals'' that the band were, along with [[The Vaselines]], [[Kurt Cobain]]'s favourite band. [[Courtney Love]]'s band [[Hole (band)|Hole]] covered the Young Marble Giants track "Credit in the Straight World"; a cover version of their song "The Man Amplifier" was included on [[The Magnetic Fields]] single "Why I Cry" as a B-side. Stuart Moxham was a fan of Manchester guitarist [[Vini Reilly]]'s early work, and was also very interested in [[Dub music|dub reggae]]. Their single "Final Day" was covered by both [[Belle and Sebastian]] and [[Galaxie 500]], and was included in ''[[The Pitchfork 500]]''.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Plagenhoef |editor1-first=Scott |editor2-last=Schreiber |editor2-first=Ryan |date=November 2008 |title=The Pitchfork 500 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |page=43 |isbn=978-1-4165-6202-3 |title-link=The Pitchfork 500 }}</ref>

==Post-breakup projects== 
After the band split up in 1980, Stuart Moxham formed The Gist,<ref name="Larkinindie"/> whose song "Love at First Sight" became a hit in continental Europe, when covered by French pop singer [[Étienne Daho]], under the title "Paris, Le Flore". Following a very severe motorbike accident Stuart concentrated on home recording, which resulted in the album ''[[Embrace the Herd]]'' (1982) again on Rough Trade,<ref name="Larkinindie"/> and his first CD album ''Signal Path'' (1992) on the Chicago-based Feel Good All Over label, before fans persuaded him to enter the studio again. The result was the album ''Random Rules'' (1993) and featured Spike (guitar and viola), younger brother Andrew (drums) and London-based French songwriter [[Louis Philippe (musician)|Louis Philippe]] (keyboard and arrangements). A band was formed to perform Stuart's new material, which gigged, albeit briefly, in France and the UK. Another album, ''Cars in the Grass'', followed. Stuart had also been recording in the US (the album ''Fine Tuning'' and six tracks on the album ''Barbara Manning Sings with the Original Artists'' (1993)), where he has acquired a small fanbase. Now based in the [[West Country]], Moxham is still writing songs. A new album, ''The Huddle House'', recorded as a duet with Philippe, with whom he has regularly performed, was released on Wonder Records in May 2007.

[[Alison Statton]], [[Spike (Welsh guitarist)|Spike]] and [[Simon Emmerson]] (later of [[Working Week (band)|Working Week]] and [[Afro Celt Sound System]]) formed [[Weekend (Welsh band)|Weekend]] (with Phil Moxham on bass)<ref name="Larkinindie"/> and several jazz musicians including [[Larry Stabbins]], [[Harry Beckett]] and [[Keith Tippett]].

In 1989 and 1990, Alison Statton worked with Ian Devine, the former guitarist of the [[post-punk]] group [[Ludus (band)|Ludus]]. They released two records together, ''The Prince of Wales'' and ''Cardiffians''. Blaine L. Reininger of [[Tuxedomoon]] was a featured performer on ''The Prince of Wales''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Devine-Statton-The-Prince-Of-Wales/master/132475|title=Devine & Statton – The Prince of Wales|publisher=Discogs}}</ref>

Later, Philip Moxham played bass for [[The Communards]] and [[Everything but the Girl]]. He featured on the latter's second UK album, ''[[Love Not Money]]'', and toured with EBTG in 1985 to promote it. He also worked with [[David Thomas (musician)|David Thomas]] and the Pedestrians.

==Reformation==
In early 2003, Statton and the Moxham brothers reunited for a [[BBC Radio Wales]] special. They performed one new song, "Alright".

A reunion show was held in [[Hay-on-Wye]] on 27 May 2007, part of the [[Hay-on-Wye|Hay-on-Wye Festival]], with Stuart Moxham's website explaining: "Young Marble Giants reform for a one-off celebration of [[Domino Recording Company|Domino Records]]' re-release of their album ''Colossal Youth'', combined in a triple CD package with the Lo-Fi, private reference recordings of the ''Salad Days'' album and the otherwise unobtainable [[John Peel|Peel Sessions]]."

[[File:Young Marble Giants in Belgium2008.jpg|thumb|The band after the gig at [[Nivelles]], Belgium, November 2008]]
Hay-on-Wye was not a one-off. Convinced by the booking agency, the band also played a show for the BB-Mix Festival in [[Boulogne-Billancourt]], just outside Paris, on 28 October 2007. The drum-machine part was played by younger Moxham brother Andrew, who played an electronic-drumkit.

The band continued to perform over this period, including appearances at the [[Primavera Sound]] Festival on 31 May 2008, and at the [[Hebbel am Ufer]] Theatre in Berlin on 16 January 2009. The YMGs played the entirety of ''Colossal Youth'' at [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] in [[Minehead]], Somerset, on 9 May 2009 – they were chosen by [[Jeff Mangum]] of [[Neutral Milk Hotel]] for a return performance at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival that he curated in March 2012, again in Minehead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpfestival.com/events/jeffmangum.php |title=ATP curated by Jeff Mangum (Neutral Milk Hotel) |work=All Tomorrow's Parties |access-date=27 August 2015}}</ref>

The band played gigs at the [[Dancehouse|Dancehouse Theatre]] in [[Manchester]] on 19 October 2014 and Stereo in [[Glasgow]] on 20 October.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts_ents/13185000.Why_Young_Marble_Giants__reunion_is_like_a_family_affair/ |title=Why Young Marble Giants' reunion is like a family affair |first=Neil |last=Cooper |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Glasgow Herald]] |date=17 October 2014 |access-date=27 August 2015}}</ref>

They also performed at the MIMI Festival, on the Frioul Island in [[Marseille]], on 3 July 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amicentre.biz/03-juillet.html |title=Festival MIMI: 3 Juillet |work=Aide aux Musiques Innovatrices |year=2015 |access-date=27 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amicentre.biz/-Festival-MIMI-2015-.html |title=Festival MIMI 2015 |work=Aide aux Musiques Innovatrices |access-date=27 August 2015}}</ref>

On 8 June 2016, Stuart Moxham wrote on the band's Facebook page that the band was no more. Young Marble Giants' last show was in London in August 2015.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}
