==History==

=== Formation: Doubting Thomas to An Acre Lost (1997–1998) ===
Poison the Well was originally formed under the name <bdi>'''Doubting Thomas'''</bdi> by lead vocalist Aryeh Lehrer and lead guitarist Ryan Primack in the autumn of 1997.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jeff Downey|title=Poison the Well : Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/poison-the-well-mn0000298225/biography|access-date=September 7, 2014|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> Lehrer was responsible for coining the name Doubting Thomas. The band was originally based in [[Coral Springs, Florida]], where the two attended [[J. P. Taravella High School]], but later moved to a rehearsal space in [[Miami|Miami, Florida]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Grabelle|first=Josh|date=June 21, 2000|title=Poison The Well|url=http://www.trustkill.com/bands/poison_the_well.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000621001507/http://www.trustkill.com/bands/poison_the_well.html|archive-date=June 21, 2000|access-date=March 4, 2021|website=[[Trustkill Records]]}}</ref> Lehrer, who had previously played in the band Reaching Out, recruited rhythm guitarist Russel Saunders, formerly of the band Side Order, and bassist Shane Halpern who had recently moved from North Carolina down to Florida. 

In December 1997, Doubting Thomas was renamed '''An Acre Lost''', a name Saunders' girlfriend came up with. 


=== ''The Opposite of December... A Season of Separation'' (1999–2001) ===
From October 2–10, 1999, Poison the Well recorded their first full-length album, ''[[The Opposite of December... A Season of Separation]]'', again with producer Jeremy Staska at Studio 13. The band invited former vocalists Hosein and Lehrer to provide backing vocals on the song "Not Within Arms Length", the lyrics of which had been written by Hosein before he left the band in 1998.

Bassist Landsman was kicked out of the band in late September 2000 due to ongoing personal differences.<ref name=":16">{{Cite web|last=Miller|first=Derek|date=January 11, 2001|title=Blame Canada|url=http://poisonthewell.wavez.net/news/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010124051600/http://poisonthewell.wavez.net/news/|archive-date=January 24, 2001|access-date=March 9, 2021|website=Poison the Well}}</ref><ref name=":14">{{Cite web|title=Message from Poison The Well regarding bassist|url=https://lambgoat.com/news/288/Message-from-Poison-The-Well-regarding-bassist|access-date=2021-03-08|website=lambgoat.com}}</ref> Landsman had been the vocalist in the Florida metalcore band [[Until the End (band)|Until the End]] and would later front the band [[Target Nevada (band)|Target Nevada]] with several ex-Poison the Well members. Nevertheless, Landsman agreed to honour Poison the Well's already-booked upcoming show on October 6, 2000 at Club Q in Davie, Florida. The show was a landmark event, not only as Landsman's final show with Poison the Well, but because it also celebrated the release of Until the End's debut extended play, already released on September 12, 2000 through [[Equal Vision Records]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Wylie|first=John|date=September 10, 2000|title=ALL THE LATEST EULOGY RELATED NEWS|url=http://www.eulogyrecordings.com/news.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001017195958/http://www.eulogyrecordings.com/news.html|archive-date=October 17, 2000|access-date=2021-03-08|website=[[Eulogy Recordings]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=September 12, 2000|title=Equal Vision Records|url=http://www.equalvision.com/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001003204429/http://www.equalvision.com/|archive-date=October 3, 2000|access-date=March 8, 2021|website=[[Equal Vision Records]]}}</ref> Despite rumors that he walking off stage mid-way through their show, Landsman finished Poison the Well's set and went on to perform with Until the End later that evening.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":14" /> However, Hornbrook was later asked to leave Until the End at Landsman's insistence.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Brickhouse|first=Chris|date=March 25, 2001|title=Poison The Well answers your questions|url=http://pahardcore.com/newsreviews/article.cfm?intarticleid=3042|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010410003102/http://pahardcore.com/newsreviews/article.cfm?intarticleid=3042|archive-date=April 10, 2001|access-date=March 12, 2021|website=PA Hardcore}}</ref>

Michael Gordillo was immediately announced as Landsman's replacement.<ref name=":15" /> Gordillo's first show with Poison the Well was on October 20, 2000 at the Downtime in Manhattan, New York.<ref name=":15">{{Cite web|title=Poison The Well's new bassist|url=https://lambgoat.com/news/222/Poison-The-Wells-new-bassist|access-date=2021-03-08|website=lambgoat.com}}</ref><ref name=":13">{{Cite web|date=October 19, 2000|title=CMJ Music Marathon Schedule|url=http://www.cmj.com/marathon/mmvenues.php|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001109022000/http://www.cmj.com/marathon/mmvenues.php|archive-date=November 9, 2000|access-date=March 8, 2021|website=[[CMJ]]}}</ref> 

Poison the Well continued touring for most of 2001 in promotion of ''The Opposite of December... A Season of Separation''. They performed at the Board Festival in Boston, Massachusetts, Hellfest in East Syracuse, New York, Monster Fest in Burlington, Vermont and Krazyfest in Louisville, Kentucky <ref>{{Cite web|title=Festival w/ Glassjaw, Poison The Well, etc.|url=https://lambgoat.com/news/382/Festival-w--Glassjaw-Poison-The-Well-etc|access-date=2021-03-12|website=lambgoat.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Poison The Well news & notes|url=https://lambgoat.com/news/727/Poison-The-Well-news-and-notes|access-date=2021-03-12|website=lambgoat.com}}</ref><ref name=":22">{{Cite web|title=Poison The Well summer tour|url=https://lambgoat.com/news/757/Poison-The-Well-summer-tour|access-date=2021-03-12|website=lambgoat.com}}</ref> 

In February 2001, Gordillo departed; a month later he was replaced by California-based bassist Javier Van Huss, formerly of the bands [[Enewetak (band)|Enewetak]], [[Eighteen Visions]], [[Throwdown (band)|Throwdown]], Breakneck, [[Bleeding Through]] and Wrench. From mid-March to mid-April 2001, Poison the Well toured with [[Candiria]], [[Origin (band)|Origin]] and [[Cryptopsy]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Poison The Well & Candiria tour|url=https://lambgoat.com/news/589/Poison-The-Well-and-Candiria-tour|access-date=2021-03-12|website=lambgoat.com}}</ref>

=== ''Tear from the Red'' (2001–2002) ===
[[Image:PTW-closeup-1.jpg|thumb|upright|Jeffrey Moreira live in 2007]]Poison the Well had originally planned to record their sophomore album in April 2001, after returning from a booked Asian tour, with a scheduled release date of August 1, 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|date=March 31, 2001|title=Poison The Well|url=http://www.trustkill.com/thewell/FAQ/index.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010331043330/http://www.trustkill.com/thewell/FAQ/index.html|archive-date=March 31, 2001|access-date=March 18, 2021|website=Poison the Well}}</ref> At that time, the release was to be made up of eleven original songs and a cover song.<ref name=":27">{{Cite web|title=Poison The Well news & notes|url=https://lambgoat.com/news/525/Poison-The-Well-news-and-notes|access-date=2021-03-12|website=lambgoat.com}}</ref> The cover song was quickly dropped and the band announced that they would instead track twelve original songs.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Poison The Well news & notes|url=https://lambgoat.com/news/644/Poison-The-Well-news-and-notes|access-date=2021-03-18|website=lambgoat.com}}</ref> Once the Asian tour was cancelled, the band took the opportunity to spend more time writing the album and opted to tour North America during the spring and summer of 2001.<ref name=":26">{{Cite web|title=Poison The Well album & tours|url=https://lambgoat.com/news/309/Poison-The-Well-album-and-tours|access-date=2021-03-12|website=lambgoat.com}}</ref><ref name=":27" /> ''Tear from the Red'' was written over a period of one year, from the summer of 2000 to the summer of 2001, during which time the band played with five different bassist. Landsman, Gordillo, Van Huss, Albert and Dovi each contributed to the songwriting and arrangements.

===''You Come Before You'' and abandoned album (2002–2005)===
The success of ''Tear from the Red'' and their continuous touring schedule helped Poison The Well gain the attention of some major labels, which had started to take interest in bands coming from the hardcore scene. The band signed with [[Atlantic Records]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=1394|title=Poison The Well getting new record deal|publisher=Lambgoat.com|access-date=September 7, 2014}}</ref> in 2002 and started writing for their third studio album, ''[[You Come Before You]]''.

Poison the Well wanted to continue the evolution of their sound and felt that they needed a team of people who understood where they were going and what they wanted to do. They recorded with Swedish producers Pelle Henricsson and Eskil Lövström.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=2164|title=Poison The Well begins tracking new album|publisher=Lambgoat.com|access-date=September 7, 2014}}</ref> Both had worked on many influential mid to late nineties Swedish hardcore records, including [[Refused]]'s ''[[Songs to Fan the Flames of Discontent]]''<ref>[http://www.burningheart.com/refused/refdisc06b.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203025323/http://www.burningheart.com/refused/refdisc06b.html |date=February 3, 2007 }}</ref> and ''[[The Shape of Punk to Come]]''.<ref>[http://www.burningheart.com/refused/refdisc02.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203021521/http://www.burningheart.com/refused/refdisc02.htm |date=February 3, 2007 }}</ref> The band first recorded in Van Nuys, California at Sound City Studios and completed the rest at Tonteknik Recording AB in Umeå, Sweden. After the record was complete, the band started a year and a half tour cycle that took them to Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=2321|title=Poison The Well update|publisher=Lambgoat.com|access-date=September 7, 2014}}</ref> Towards the end, many of the band members were worn out and unsure if they wanted to continue with Poison the Well.

Having experienced some level of success with their previous record, ''You Come Before You'', a long and hard touring cycle left certain members of the band disenchanted. In the summer of 2004, guitarist Derek Miller quit the band. Miller had been in Poison the Well for all three prior releases and was a major part of the writing process. Poison The Well had been in the middle of pre-production for an entire record's worth of material when Miller announced his departure.<ref>{{cite web|title=Derek Miller quits Poison The Well|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=3861|access-date=September 7, 2014|publisher=Lambgoat.com}}</ref>

===''Versions'' (2005–2008)===
Poison the Well eventually regrouped, added guitarist Jason Boyer to replace Miller, and started working on new musical ideas that would be the early stages of their fourth studio album, ''[[Versions (Poison the Well album)|Versions]]''. After months of working and writing material, the band set off in early 2005 to work and record with Pelle Henricsson and Eskil Lövström at Tonteknik Studios in Umeå, Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/cdreviews/fr/ptwellversions.htm|title=Poison The Well - Versions|publisher=Heavymetal.about.com|access-date=September 7, 2014}}</ref> After completing the first two recording sessions and returning home, Poison the Well announced that they were parting ways with Atlantic Records after only one album because of "creative differences". Atlantic Records had given full creative control with the writing and recording of ''You Come Before You'', not interfering and allowing the band to do what they pleased. But, after not seeing eye to eye on the direction Poison The Well had decided to move, Atlantic agreed to let the band go.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=6920|title=Poison The Well splits with Atlantic Recs|publisher=Lambgoat.com|access-date=September 7, 2014}}</ref>

Even though the band had no label, they returned to writing material for the third and final session. The band had been in contact with [[Ferret Music]] president Carl Severson about signing with the label. Severson had been friends and a fan of the band for many years and expressed interest in signing them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=7802|title=Poison The Well signs w/ Ferret Music|publisher=Lambgoat.com|access-date=September 7, 2014}}</ref> After signing at the end of 2006, the band left once again for Sweden to finish up the record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=7942 |title=Poison The Well finishes recording album |website=Lambgoat.com |date=December 10, 2006 |access-date=April 11, 2020}}</ref> ''Versions'' was released on Ferret Music on April 2, 2007 in Europe and April 3, 2007 worldwide. On February 22, 2007 they began touring in support of the album.

===''The Tropic Rot'' (2008–2009)===
[[File:Bradley Grace, Australia, 2009.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bradley Grace, Australia, 2009]]
The writing process for ''[[The Tropic Rot]]'' started a few weeks after Poison the Well finished up the touring cycle for ''Versions''. The band wanted to make a record that was more focused musically and bigger sonically. Poison the Well wrote the entire record in four and a half months in a condemned and purportedly haunted bar, the remnants of Ray's Downtown Blues which is now Longboards, in West Palm Beach, Florida. ''The Tropic Rot'' had originally been slated to be made with producer J. Robbins, but had to be cancelled due to a serious family emergency. 

[[Steve Evetts]] was picked among other potential producers the band thought could capture the record the way they wanted it and could start as soon as possible. The record was recorded at Castle Oaks Production and The Candy Shop studios and was released on July 7, 2009<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=4385025&blogId=478844489 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120722213232/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=4385025&blogId=478844489 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 22, 2012 |title=THE TROPIC ROT - available July 7th (date changed) von Poison The Well bei Myspace |website=Archive.is |date=July 22, 2012 |access-date=April 11, 2020}}</ref> through Ferret Music.<ref>[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/BLABBERMOUTH.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=116761]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The album charted at No.&nbsp;180 in its first week of release on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

While on the first stop of their September 2009 tour with [[Billy Talent]], Poison The Well was robbed at a tour stop in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]]. As the band was asleep in their hotel, thieves drove off with their van and trailer containing all of their musical gear, band merchandise, and a majority of their personal possessions and clothes. After taking a few days off to get a new van and obtain some temporary gear, the band quickly produced and began selling T-shirts to raise money and buy new equipment, with the shirts containing a detailed description of all musical gear stolen including guitar and amplifier serial numbers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/35245|title=Poison The Well robbed in Detroit|website=Punknews.org|access-date=September 7, 2014}}</ref>
