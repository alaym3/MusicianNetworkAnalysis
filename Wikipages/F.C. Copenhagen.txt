'''Football Club Copenhagen''' ({{lang-da|Football Club København}}, {{IPA-da|kʰøpm̩ˈhɑwˀn|pron}}), commonly known as '''FC København''', '''FC Copenhagen''', '''Copenhagen''' or simply '''FCK''',  is a professional Danish [[association football|football]] club in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark.  FCK was founded in 1992 through the merger of [[Kjøbenhavns Boldklub]] and [[Boldklubben 1903]].

F.C. Copenhagen has won 13 [[List of Danish football champions|Danish Football Championships]] and 8 [[Danish Cup]]s. In European football F.C. Copenhagen has reached the group stage of the [[UEFA Champions League]] and the group stage of the [[UEFA Europa League]] more times than any other Danish club and are the only Danish club who has reached the knockout stage of the Champions League. As of July 2019, Copenhagen are the highest ranked Scandinavian club in the UEFA team rankings list.<ref name="UEFA rank">{{cite web |url=https://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/uefarankings/club/index.html#/yr/2019 |title=UEFA Rankings |access-date=1 July 2019 |work=UEFA}}</ref>

Copenhagen plays its matches at the [[Parken Stadium]], which also serves as the venue for [[Denmark national football team]] matches. Since their foundation, FCK have developed a fierce rivalry with [[Brøndby IF]]. The [[Copenhagen Derby]] games between the two sides have attracted some of the biggest crowds in Danish football history.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090813230120/http://www.netsuperligaen.dk/VisRekorder.php?SeasonID=2006&sort=desc Attendance season records] at ''NetSuperligaen.dk'', which dates back to the [[Danish Superliga 1998-99]], shows that the biggest crowd each year has been a derby between F.C. København and Brøndby.</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of F.C. Copenhagen}}
[[File:F.C. Copenhagen 2017.jpg|333px|thumb|left]]

===Early success===
Football Club Copenhagen is, in many ways, both an old and a new club. Even though the club was established in 1992, it is rooted in more than 100 years of club tradition. The club's first team represents two separate clubs: [[Kjøbenhavns Boldklub]] (continental Europe's oldest football club) founded in 1876 and [[Boldklubben 1903]] founded in 1903. The two Copenhagen clubs merged their first teams to found Copenhagen on 1 July 1992. Copenhagen used Boldklubben's club license to play in the [[Danish Superliga]] championship, while [[Kjøbenhavns Boldklub]] became the official reserve team of the club. With the rebuilding of the [[Parken Stadium]], Denmark's national team stadium, the new club had a modern stadium to play at from the beginning. The initial ambition of the club was continually to qualify for one of the European competitions each season. To reach this goal, the club needed a solid economy, a relatively big fan base and an "attractive and positive style of football."<ref name="fck">{{cite web |url=http://fck.dk/english/history/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514000826/http://www.fck.dk/english/history/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2006-05-14 |title=History |year=2006 |work=F.C. Copenhagen }}</ref>

[[Benny Johansen]] managed the club and started its maiden season well. FCK made its first appearance in the European tournaments when it beat Swiss team [[Grasshopper Club Zürich|Grasshoppers]] 2–1 in the [[1992 Intertoto Cup|1992]] [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]].<ref name="1992-grasshoppers">{{cite web|url=http://fck.dk/index.php?pageid=168 |title=01.07.

The club won the [[1992–93 Danish Superliga|1992–93 Superliga season]] one point ahead of [[Odense Boldklub]] and two points ahead of third-place [[Brøndby IF]].<ref name="hist92">{{cite web |url=http://fck.dk/english/history/1992/ |title=Season 1992/93&nbsp;– "We are the champions" |access-date=27 October 2007 |work=F.C.

The season opened with a 0–6 thrashing at the hands of Italian team [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] in the [[1993–94 UEFA Champions League|1993–94 Champions League]] qualification. FCK went on winter break after the first half of the Superliga season in third place. In the spring of 1994, Copenhagen gained on leading team [[Silkeborg IF]]. In the penultimate match of the season, the two teams met at the Parken Stadium. In front of a record-setting attendance of 26,679,<ref name="sif-attendance">{{cite web |url=http://fck.dk/index.php?pageid=253 |title=05.06 F.C. Copenhagen&nbsp;– Silkeborg IF |work=F.C. Copenhagen |language=da}}</ref> FCK won the match 4–1. The club was one point ahead of Silkeborg, but because FCK lost 3–2 to Odense in the final game of the season, it had to settle for second place.<ref name="hist93">{{cite web |url=http://fck.dk/english/history/1993/ |title=Season 1993/94&nbsp;– So near...&nbsp;– but so far! |access-date=27 October 2007 |work=F.C.

===Years of underachievement===
For the next three seasons, Copenhagen had little success in the Superliga, despite winning two [[Danish Cup]]s. The team won the 1995 Cup final against [[Akademisk Boldklub]] with a 5–0 win, qualifying for European football once again, despite mediocre results in the league. [[Kim Brink]] took over as manager in 1996, but despite winning the second Cup trophy for the club, the eighth-place finish in the [[1996–97 Danish Superliga|1996–97 Superliga season]] prompted another change in managers.<ref name="hist94">{{cite web |url=http://fck.dk/english/history/1994/ |title=Season 1994/95&nbsp;– Record cup-final win! |access-date=27 October 2007 |work=F.C.

===Flemming Østergaard joins the board===
In February [[1997 in football (soccer)|1997]], [[Flemming Østergaard]], later given the nickname "Don Ø," joined the board of the club as [[vice chairman]] and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]]. After a successful [[Initial public offering|IPO]], generating [[Danish krone|DKK]] 75&nbsp;million, FCK was introduced on the [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange]] in November 1997. The 1997–98 season marked the first season that Copenhagen averaged more than 10,000 spectators at home, and the club bought their stadium Parken for DKK 138&nbsp;million in June 1998.<ref name="hist97">{{cite web |url=http://fck.dk/english/history/1997/ |title=Season 1997/98&nbsp;– A new era |access-date=27 October 2007 |work=F.C.

After 75 controversial days, however, he was fired in March 1999; Sports Director [[Niels-Christian Holmstrøm]] explained Andersen had created frustration among the players.<ref>Søren Olsen, "Eklatant fejl at hyre Christian Andersen", [[Politiken]], 1999-03-22</ref>

In 1999, Copenhagen made its impact in [[UEFA|Europe]] when it faced English side [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the second round [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]]. In the first leg away at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]], [[Bjarne Goldbæk]] gave Copenhagen the lead nine minutes before the end of the match, but Chelsea scored in the last minute of the game. Chelsea later won the second game at Parken with a goal by the Dane [[Brian Laudrup]], knocking out FCK. At the post-match press conference, it was announced that Chelsea's Brian Laudrup was signing with Copenhagen in January 1999, with Bjarne Goldbæk moving in the other direction for Chelsea. A four-time [[Danish Player of the Year]] award winner, Laudrup, however, could not help Copenhagen improve their league position, and the club ended the year in seventh in the [[1998–99 Danish Superliga|1998–99 Superliga season]]. Laudrup only stayed for just six months at the club before signing for [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] at the end of the season.<ref name="hist98">{{cite web |url=http://fck.dk/english/history/1998/ |title=Season 1998/99&nbsp;– So close to European-glory in London! |access-date=27 October 2007 |work=F.C.

Copenhagen struggled to make any significant impact and finished eighth in the league.

===Champions again===
In the winter [[2000 in football (soccer)|2000]] [[transfer window]], South African striker [[Sibusiso Zuma]] was signed from South African side [[Orlando Pirates]],<ref name="hist99">{{cite web |url=http://fck.dk/english/history/1999/ |title=Season 1999/00&nbsp;– Win some... draw most! |access-date=27 October 2007 |work=F.C.

From the [[2000–01 Danish Superliga|2000–01 season]], the club started to improve. The club won its second Superliga championship, winning 3–1 in the last [[Copenhagen Derby]] match of the season, at the Parken Stadium. The 2–0 goal was a [[bicycle kick]] by Zuma, who received the ball at his chest, bounced it in the air and in the same motion executed the overhead kick, volleying the ball into the far corner out of Brøndby goalkeeper [[Mogens Krogh]]'s reach. This was later voted the Danish goal of the year,<ref name="hist00">{{cite web |url=http://fck.dk/english/history/2000/ |title=Season 2000/01&nbsp;– Winning the championship...at last |access-date=27 October 2007 |work=F.C.

The 2001 season is also remembered for a highly dramatic event. During training on 13 March 2001 charismatic midfielder [[Ståle Solbakken]] suffered a heart attack. He was rapidly attended to by club doctor Frank Odgaard who found that his heart had stopped beating and started to administer cardiac massage. Upon the ambulance's arrival, Solbakken was pronounced clinically dead at the scene, but on the way to the hospital in the ambulance he was revived nearly seven minutes later. He survived the episode and had a pacemaker fitted. Shortly after, on medical advice, he announced his playing retirement, but would later return to the club and become its most successful manager.

Copenhagen faced Italian team [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] for qualification to the [[2001–02 UEFA Champions League|2001–02 Champions League]] qualification. A 2–1 win for FCK in the first game proved moot, as Lazio ultimately progressed with a 5–3 aggregate score. Copenhagen thus entered the [[2001–02 UEFA Cup]], where it defeated Dutch giants Ajax 1–0 on a goal from left back [[Niclas Jensen]]. In the next round, however, German team [[Borussia Dortmund]] eliminated Copenhagen. The [[2001–02 Danish Superliga|2001–02 Superliga season]] also ended in disappointment for København, as Brøndby won the championship on [[goal difference]] after FCK had caught up with Brøndby's ten-point lead after the first half of the season.<ref name="hist01">{{cite web |url=http://fck.dk/english/history/2001/ |title=Season 2001/02&nbsp;– European success...but a bitter end to the season |access-date=27 October 2007 |work=F.C.

In the Champions League second qualifying round in [[2004–05 UEFA Champions League|2004–05]], FCK won the first match against Slovenian club [[ND Gorica]] 2–1, but later lost at Parken 0–5. Under Backe, Copenhagen went on to win the 2004 and 2006 Danish championships and the 2004 Danish Cup. Copenhagen also won the inaugural [[2004–05 Royal League|2004–05 edition]] of the [[Royal League]] tournament, beating Swedish team [[IFK Göteborg]] on [[Penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout]] in the [[2005 Royal League Final|2005 final]].<ref name="2005-gothenburg">{{cite web|url=http://fck.dk/index.php?pageid=711 |title=26.05.

===European ambitions===
For the [[2006–07 F.C. Copenhagen season|2006–07 season]], [[Denmark national football team|Danish national team]] player [[Jesper Grønkjær]] reinforced Copenhagen. FCK looked forward to the [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League|2006–07 Champions League]] qualifiers, where it beat [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]]. For the first time in the club's history, FCK entered the group stage of the Champions League, being grouped with [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], all former winners of the trophy. Despite not losing a game at Parken (Benfica 0–0, Manchester United 1–0 and Celtic 3–1), FCK failed to qualify from the Champions League group stage after losing all of its away games.<ref name="2006-uclmatches">{{cite web |url=http://fck.dk/saesonen/kalender/fckoebenhavn/?cal_gt%5B%5D=championsleague&cal_ds=1151704800%7C1167519600 |title=Kalender (Champions League efterår 2006) |access-date=27 October 2007 |work=F.C.

Copenhagen}}</ref>

In the [[2007–08 F.C. Copenhagen season|2007–08 season]], Copenhagen lost the third qualification round of the Champions League with a 1–3 aggregate score to Benfica. After beating [[RC Lens|Lens]] 3–2, FCK qualified for the group stages of the [[2007–08 UEFA Cup]], where it played [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] (H), [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv Moscow]] (A), [[Atlético Madrid]] (H) and [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]].<ref name="2007-uc">{{cite web| url=http://www.uefa.com/footballeurope/club=52709/competition=14/index.html |title=FC København |access-date=27 October 2007 |work=[[UEFA]]}}</ref> Copenhagen fell to Panathinaikos and Atlético, but a win against Lokomotiv meant that the club needed only a draw against Aberdeen to qualify for the next round. However, a 0–4 defeat to Aberdeen put them out of the tournament.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7151528.stm |title=Aberdeen 4–0 Copenhagen |access-date=20 December 2007 |work=[[BBC]]  | date=20 December 2007}}</ref> In the [[2007–08 Danish Superliga|2007–08 Superliga]] season, Copenhagen finished third, with [[AaB Fodbold|AaB]] taking the title.

In the [[2008–09 F.C. Copenhagen season|2008–09 season]], Copenhagen began strong. The team qualified for the [[2008–09 UEFA Cup group stage]] by eliminating Northern Ireland club [[Cliftonville F.C.|Cliftonville]], Lillestrøm and [[FC Moscow]]. In the group, FCK lost at home to [[AS Saint-Étienne|Saint-Étienne]] and drew 1–1 against [[Valencia CF|Valencia]]. With a 1–1 draw against [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]] and a win over [[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]], Copenhagen qualified for the knockout phase of the competition, where it drew 2–2 in the first leg of the round of 32 against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on 19 February 2009. The club lost 1–2 in the second leg, a loss that ended its European season. In the domestic league, FCK battled for first place with Brøndby and Odense. Eventually, Copenhagen won the Cup final against AaB and claimed the league title with one game to spare in the tournament, thus securing the [[Double (association football)|Double]] for the second time in the club's history. 2010 proved to be yet another European success. Even though the team lost the [[2009–10 UEFA Champions League|2009–10 Champions League]] playoff match to [[APOEL FC|APOEL]] with a 2–3 aggregate loss, the team had already qualified to the [[2009–10 UEFA Europa League group stage|2009–10 Europa League group stage]] by eliminating [[FK Mogren]] and [[Stabæk Fotball|Stabæk]]. Copenhagen lost away to [[CFR Cluj]], won 1–0 at home against [[AC Sparta Prague|Sparta Prague]], 0–1 away loss against [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] and by beating Cluj at home 2–0 and 3–0 away over Sparta, Copenhagen qualified for the [[2009–10 UEFA Europa League knockout phase#Round of 32|round of 32]] to face [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]]. The match-up, however, resulted in two 1–3 losses for Copenhagen, thus eliminating them from the competition.

The team's qualification to the [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League|2010–11 Champions League]] was secured after it beating [[FC BATE Borisov|BATE Borisov]] (0–0 / 3–2) and Rosenborg (1–2 / 1–0). The team thus entered the [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League group stage|group stage]] in Group D and met [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], Panathinaikos and [[FC Rubin Kazan|Rubin Kazan]]. After a 3–1 win against Panathinaikos in their last group stage match, they qualified for the [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League knockout phase|round of 16]]—thereby becoming the first-ever Danish club to reach the stage in the Champions League—where [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] defeated them.

===Solbakken Returns===
Copenhagen won the [[2012–13 Danish Superliga]] to secure a direct place in the [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League group stage|group stage]] of the [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League|2013–14 Champions League]]. However, after a horrific start to the [[2013–14 Danish Superliga]] season, FCK fired manager [[Ariël Jacobs]], rehiring [[Ståle Solbakken]] as his replacement. Solbakken was given a two-year contract with the option for a further two-year extension. In the Champions League, the club was placed into Group B alongside [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]]. FCK secured four points by drawing 1–1 against Juventus at home and winning 1–0 at home over Galatasaray after a great goal by [[Daniel Braaten]]. The club, however, conceded its first-ever Champions League group stage home defeat after falling 0–2 to Real Madrid in the last round of the group stage.

Copenhagen finished the 2013–14 league in second place, despite having been situated third for numerous weeks. A 3–2 away win against [[FC Midtjylland]] saw them closing in on the second place. In the last round of the league, FCK beat [[Odense Boldklub]] 3–2 at home whilst Midtjylland lost their game 3–1, ensuring Copenhagen's seizure of second place and its subsequent spot in the qualifying round of the [[2014–15 UEFA Champions League qualifying phase and play-off round|2014–15 Champions League]].

After a busy summer transfer window with numerous new players arriving at the club, Copenhagen was drawn against Ukrainian outfit [[FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]] in the third qualifying round of the 2014–15 Champions League. After an aggregate victory of 2–0 over Dnipro, Copenhagen was drawn against German club [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]] in the play-off round. The Germans, however, defeated Copenhagen 7–2 aggregate, dropping Copenhagen to contention in the [[2014–15 UEFA Europa League|2014–15 Europa League]].

FCK drew Italian club [[Torino F.C.|Torino]], Club Brugge and Finnish side [[Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi|HJK Helsinki]]. Its campaign started well, securing a deserved 2–0 victory over HJK at home from two goals by [[Nicolai Jørgensen]]. Copenhagen's next two games were against Torino and Club Brugge respectively; it lost 1–0 against Torino and played to a 1–1 draw against Brugge after conceding a late goal in injury time in both matches. Copenhagen then failed to secure an important win against Brugge at home, a match they lost 0–4, setting up a must-win situation for FCK against HJK to progress to the round of 32. Copenhagen, however, failed—[[Macoumba Kandji]] managed to secure a 2-1 victory for HJK, their second win in the group, with another late goal. The result eliminated Copenhagen. The [[2014–15 F.C. Copenhagen season|2014–15 season]] ended with Copenhagen winning the [[2014–15 Danish Cup|Danish Cup]] and finishing second in the [[2014–15 Danish Superliga|Superliga]].

The [[2015–16 F.C. Copenhagen season|2015–16 season]] began with FCK bringing in six new players, most notably Danish international and former [[AaB Fodbold|AaB]] player [[Kasper Kusk]]. By placing second in 2014–15, Copenhagen began in the second qualifying round of the [[2015–16 UEFA Europa League]], where they were drawn against Welsh club [[Newtown A.F.C.|Newtown]], defeating them 5–1 on aggregate to qualify them for the next round against Czech outfit [[FK Baumit Jablonec|Baumit Jablonec]]. The opening game of the [[2015–16 Danish Superliga]] ended in a 2–1 away win for FCK against [[Esbjerg fB]] through goals from [[Marvin Pourié]] and [[Nicolai Jørgensen]]. Despite a 0–1 away win over Baumit Jablonec, Copenhagen lost its home game 2–3, resulting in a 3–3 aggregate loss on the [[away goals rule]]. This marked the first time in ten years that Copenhagen failed to qualify for either the Champions League or Europa League. On the 5th of May, the [[2015-16 Danish Cup|Danish Cup]] was won, after a 2–1 win Over AGF, with goals from [[Nicolai Jørgensen]] and [[William Kvist]].

After winning the title the previous season, Copenhagen would compete in the [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League|2016-17 Champions League qualifiers]]. In the playoff round they met [[APOEL FC]], and was faced with the challenge on getting revenge after their tie against them in 2009. The first leg at Parken stadium ended 1-0 to the home team, and in the second leg, Copenhagen equalised in the 86th minute via [[Federico Santander]]'s shot from a wide angle, qualifying for the group stage, with an aggregate score of 2-1. Copenhagen were subsequently placed in a group with [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], [[FC Porto]] and [[Club Brugge KV|Club Brügge]]. They would after 2 wins, 1 loss and 3 draws, finish 3rd in their group and move on to the [[2016-17 Europa League Round of 32]], where they met [[PFC Ludogorets Razgrad|Ludogorats]], whom they beat 2-1 on aggregate. In the round of 16, they met [[AFC Ajax|Ajax Amsterdam]]. In the first leg at home, Copenhagen won 2-1 after a first minute goal from [[Rasmus Falk]] and a goal in the 59th minute by [[Andreas Cornelius]]. The away leg finished 2-0 to Ajax, and Copenhagen were knocked out of the tournament, with that seasons achievements in the Europa League being their best finish in the competition at the time. Domestically, the season was another season to enjoy for fans of the club. Copenhagen won the league with the closest competition, Brøndby, finishing 24 points behind them. At the time they were crowned champions, following a draw against [[FC Nordsjælland]] they were unbeaten in the league, with their first loss of the season coming against [[FC Midtjylland]] 2 rounds later, and subsequently another loss against [[Lyngby Boldklub|Lyngby BK]] the round right after. Copenhagen also reached the cup final, where they met arch-rivals Brøndby. Copenhagen opened the scoring via [[Andreas Cornelius]]'s first ever goal against the club, with Brøndby responding just 10 minutes later with an equaliser. Copenhagen secured the win with two goals in rapid succession, in the 83rd and 85th minutes, both long balls from defence to attack, scored by Santander and Cornelius respectively, thus resulting in the club from the capital winning their third consecutive cup final, along with their second consecutive domestic double.

In September 2019, the club announced that it would change its name in European competitions and would subsequently be known as F.C. Copenhagen with UEFA changing their abbreviation 'KOB' to 'CPH'.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.fck.dk/en/news/fc-kobenhavn-and-fc-copenhagen |title=F.C. KØBENHAVN AND F.C.

Winning the [[2018–19 Danish Superliga]] placed Copenhagen in the second qualifying round of the [[2019-20 UEFA Champions League]], beating Welsh outfit [[The New Saints]]. The following round against [[Red Star Belgrade]] ended 2–2 on aggregate, with Copenhagen pulling the shortest straw and going out in penalties, thus sending Copenhagen to the [[UEFA Europa League]] instead. Here Latvian team [[Riga FC|Riga]] were beaten 3–2 on aggregate thus securing qualification for the Group Stage. Copenhagen finishing second in Group B contested with [[FC Lugano]], [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] and Scandinavian rivals [[Malmö FF]]. Copenhagen were then drawn against Scottish outfit [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in the first knockout round of the [[2019–20 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]]. The first match in [[Telia Parken]] finished 1–1, whilst Copenhagen won the return leg 3–1 at [[Celtic Park]]. The opponent for the next round were the Turkish club [[İstanbul Başakşehir F.K.|Istanbul Başakşehir]]. The game ended 1–0 with Copenhagen falling to a late penalty converted by [[Edin Višća]]. The subsequent return match in Copenahagen was temporarily put on hold due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. On 5 August 2020, Copenhagen won 3–0 over Istanbul Başakşehir to reach the quarter-finals for the first time in their history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/match/2028224--copenhagen-vs-istanbul-basaksehir/postmatch/report/ |title=Copenhagen 3–0 Istanbul Başakşehir |website=UEFA |date=5 August 2020 }}</ref> In the quarter-finals, Copenhagen lost 0–1 to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] with a penalty from [[Bruno Fernandes]] coming in after extra time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/aug/10/manchester-united-v-fc-copenhagen-europa-league-quarter-final-live |title=Manchester United 1-0 FC Copenhagen: Europa League quarter-final – as it happened |website=The Guardian |date=10 August 2020 }}</ref>

[[File:Fc Copenhagen v Juventus, 17 Sept 2013.jpg|thumb|[[Parken Stadium]]]]

FCK owns its stadium, the national arena [[Parken Stadium]]. It was built in 1992, the same year the club was founded. Until the stadium opened (as Parken) in September 1992, the club played its first home matches at the smaller [[Østerbro Stadion]], which is located adjacent to Parken. Parken has 38,065 seats, 4,000 fewer seats than the original capacity of 42,305.<ref name="capacity">{{cite web |url=http://fck.dk/fck/parken/ |title=PARKEN |work=F.C.

In 2006, a part of the lower "B-stand" was made a separate fan section for the fans who wanted to create more of an atmosphere and named ''Sektion 12''. In general, most of FCK's supporters are from, and live, in the Copenhagen area, unlike their rivals, Brøndby IF, who have a reported 57% of their fanbase coming from [[Jutland]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=1 November 2016|title=Fem foreløbige sæsonrekorder: Brøndby-boost til udebanerne - Brøndby IF|url=https://brondby.com/nyhed/2016/11/01/fem-foreloebige-saesonrekorder-broendby-boost-til-udebanerne?fbclid=IwAR3oZVjIbSMMP5Yq13bNCu1FRh7cFFqftQNR-4z5FbrBH4blPc9dXSK7Dxg|url-status=live}}</ref> The area Sektion 12 on the lower "B-stand" grew so popular that the fans in a dialogue with the club made it bigger. That meant that the former family-area in the stadium in the other part of the "B-stand" got the whole new area called the "D-stand". The Sektion 12 area on the whole lower "B-stand" grew more and more popular which meant that the fans had a new dialogue with the club. That dialogue went well for the supporters and the club supported the suggestion of making the upper "B-stand" the second part of Sektion 12. Sektion 12 on the whole "B-stand" is now Northern Europe's biggest active stand.

==Copenhagen in European competitions==
{{main|F.C. Copenhagen in European football}}

Copenhagen's first competitive European match was on 16 September 1992, in the [[1992–93 UEFA Cup]], beating [[Mikkelin Palloilijat|MP]] 10–1 before losing to [[AJ Auxerre]] in the second round. In their first ever [[UEFA Champions League]] group stage match, they beat [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] 1–0 at home, via a goal in the 73rd minute by [[Marcus Allbäck]].

Since then, the club has quickly become the most successful Danish team in European competition, reaching the group stage of the [[UEFA Champions League]] four times and advancing to the Round of 16 in [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League|2010–11]]. They also reached the quarter-finals of the [[UEFA Europa League]] in [[2019–20 UEFA Europa League|2019–20]] which they lost to Manchester United 1-0 in extra time.
