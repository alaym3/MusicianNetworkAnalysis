'''The Wedding Present''' are an English [[indie rock]] group originally formed in 1985 in [[Leeds]], England, from the ashes of the Lost Pandas.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=1240/1}}</ref> The band's [[music]] has evolved from fast-paced [[indie rock]] in the vein of their most obvious influences [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]], [[Buzzcocks]] and [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]] to more varied forms. Throughout their career, they have been led by vocalist and guitarist [[David Gedge]], the band's only constant member.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/may/19/cult-heroes-if-you-buy-into-david-gedges-worldview-the-wedding-present-is-the-greatest-gift-youll-ever-get|title=Cult heroes: if you buy into David Gedge's worldview, the Wedding Present is the greatest gift you'll ever get|last=Beaumont|first=Mark|date=2015-05-19|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-09-13}}</ref>

Closely linked to the [[C86]] scene, the band has charted a total of eighteen singles in the top 40 of the [[UK Singles Chart]], including a historic run of twelve singles – one for each month – in the year of 1992, which tied [[Elvis Presley]]'s record for most top 40 hits in a single year.

==History==
===Early stages and the Reception era (1985-1989)===
The band has its origins in the Lost Pandas, which folded in 1984 when Janet Rigby, the drummer for the band, left following departure of guitarist Michael Duane.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.brightonsfinest.com/html/index.php/9-articles/182-David-Gedge-The-Wedding-Present-interview|title=David Gedge from The Wedding Present - Interview|last=Samson|first=Frank|website=Brightonsfinest.com|access-date=2016-09-13}}</ref> David Gedge and The Lost Pandas' bass player, Keith Gregory, decided to continue the band, renaming it The Wedding Present.<ref name="Larkin"/> The name was jointly conceived by Gedge and his girlfriend at the time, as they were both avid fans of [[The Birthday Party (band)|The Birthday Party]] and it was an homage to their favourite band.<ref name=":0" />

{{quote|I’ve always thought that The Wedding Present was an inappropriate name for a [[pop music|pop]] band — more like a poem, or a book or something — and therefore quite attractive (to me!). I’ve also always been fascinated by weddings...<ref>David Gedge quoted from the [http://www.westnet.com/weddoes/faq.html#Q7.1 Wedding Present FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015102514/http://westnet.com/weddoes/faq.html |date=15 October 2007 }}.</ref>}}

Gedge and Gregory recruited an old schoolmate of Gedge's, [[Peter Solowka]], to play guitar and auditioned a string of drummers, including John Ramsden, and Mike Bedford, with whom they recorded a [[demo tape]], before settling on Shaun Charman.<ref name="Larkin"/> The country's clubs and bars were toured as the band prepared for the recording of their first, self-financed [[single (music)|single]]. "Go Out and Get ’Em, Boy!" was chosen over early favourite "Will You Be Up There?" Charman felt somewhat insecure about his drumming abilities and so the [[Single (music)|A-side]] features drumming by hired hand Julian Sowa (Charman does, however, play drums on its [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]). The single was released on the band's own [[Reception Records]] label<ref name="Larkin"/> with distribution through [[Red Rhino]].

Two more singles followed that did well on the independent charts helped by veteran [[BBC]] [[radio]] [[DJ]] [[John Peel]] who was one of their first champions.<ref name="Larkin"/> He invited them to do a radio session (three songs from the session are included on the 1988 [[compilation album|compilation]] ''Tommy 1985-1987;'' the entire session had already been released as an [[Extended play|EP]] in 1986), starting a long collaboration. By the time the band started work on their debut album, a number of independent and major [[record company|record companies]] showed interest, but the band declined all offers and decided to keep releasing their material themselves. The album was released in 1987 and titled ''[[George Best (album)|George Best]]'' after the well-known [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] [[football (soccer)|football]] [[George Best|player]].<ref name="Larkin"/> It was produced by the band and [[Chris Allison]].

Upon its release, the album was critically acclaimed and the band were soon classified, with some of their peers, as members of the 'shambling' or [[C86 (music)|C86]] scene, a categorisation that they vehemently declined (although they were featured on the original C86 compilation). Musically, the album featured fast-paced rhythm guitar; lyrically, apart from a few excursions into social critique ("All This and More") and politics ("All About Eve"), Gedge's main concerns (which would become his trademark) were [[love]], lust, heartbreak and revenge.<ref name="Larkin"/> Soon after the release of ''George Best'', the early singles and radio sessions were compiled and released as ''[[Tommy (1985-1987)]].'' When Solowka, who has [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] roots, started fooling around with a Ukrainian folk tune during one of their Peel sessions,<ref name="Larkin"/> the idea arose to devote some of their radio time to recording their versions of Ukrainian folk songs, encouraged by Peel. To this end, two guest musicians were invited, [[singing|singer]]/[[violin]] player [[Len Liggins]] and [[mandolin]] player [[Roman Remeynes]], and three Peel sessions were recorded with Gedge temporarily limiting himself to playing [[rhythm guitar]] and arranging the songs.

Between the recording of the first and the second 'Ukrainian' session, Charman was fired from the band. His replacement was [[Simon Smith (drummer)|Simon Smith]],<ref name="Larkin"/> who remained the band's drummer until 1997 and for a long time was, next to Gedge, the only other stable factor in the shifting line-ups. The band planned on releasing eight cuts from the Ukrainian sessions on a 10" [[vinyl record|LP]] and an initial batch was pressed when Red Rhino went into [[receivership]]. Rather than trying to find a new distribution company, the band decided to fold their Reception label altogether and sign with a regular [[record company]]: [[RCA]].

===The RCA era (1989-1993)===
Although the band were criticized by some quarters for 'selling out', under the terms of their contract they were allowed their own choice of producer and singles.  They also had the option of releasing any singles rejected by the label independently without breach of contract. The band's new record company bought the initial Reception stock of the Ukrainian record from the band, pressed another batch, and released the record in April 1989 under the name of ''[[Українські Виступи в Івана Піла]]'' (meaning 'Ukrainian John Peel Sessions'; the Latin [[transliteration]] ''Ukraïnski Vistupi v Ivana Peela'' appeared on the sleeve's spine only).

The first proper album that The Wedding Present recorded for their new label was released in the same year 1989 and reunited them with producer [[Chris Allison]]. ''[[Bizarro (album)|Bizarro]]''’s lyrical themes were largely the same as before and the songs featured the same [[three-chord song|three-chord]] structures, but its production values had increased due to a larger recording budget. The album was recorded at Jacobs Studios by Steve Lyon and mixed by him and [[Chris Allison]]. The album's companion single, "Kennedy", provided the band with their first British [[Top 40]] hit.<ref name="Larkin"/> 

In 1989, the band covered the song "Box Elder" by a then-unknown American indie rock band named [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]]. Gregory had found Pavement's limited pressing debut single during a trip to the United States and The Wedding Present's cover inspired [[John Peel]] to promote Pavement on his radio show, a key step in Pavement's breakthrough.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Wedding Present covered Pavement before anybody knew who that was|url=https://music.avclub.com/the-wedding-present-covered-pavement-before-anybody-kne-1798265390|access-date=2021-04-05|website=Music|language=en-us}}</ref>

Seeing that they were growing more popular in the American college radio scene, the band turned towards America for their next project. The band decided to re-record ''Bizarro'' track "Brassneck" with the former [[Big Black]] frontman [[Steve Albini]].<ref name="Larkin" /> It was the start of a two-year collaboration: the next single, "Corduroy" and album, ''[[Seamonsters]]'', were also recorded by Albini<ref name="Larkin" /> at [[Pachyderm Studio|Pachyderm Recording Studio]] in [[Cannon Falls, Minnesota]].

''[[Melody Maker]]'' likened listening to the record to sandpapering your ears. End of year readers polls, however, showed the opening track and lead single of the album, "Dalliance", amongst the top of the favourites list. Almost directly after recording the album, the band announced that they had sacked Solowka. His replacement was [[Paul Dorrington]] of local band, [[Tse Tse Fly (band)|Tse Tse Fly]] (also formerly of [[A.C. Temple]]). Solowka teamed up again with Liggins and Remeynes to form [[The Ukrainians]], and continued to blend post-punk with traditional Ukrainian music.<ref name="Larkin"/>

==== The Hit Parade (1992) ====
The next year saw the band release twelve 7" singles in one year.<ref name="Larkin"/> Each single had a limited pressing of 10,000 copies which all reached the Top 30 in the [[UK Singles Chart]],<ref name="Larkin"/> equalling [[Elvis Presley]]'s record for the most UK Top 30 hits in one year. To economise on songwriting, the [[B-side]]s consisted of cover versions of songs including [[Julee Cruise]]'s "Falling" (the theme tune from [[Twin Peaks]]). The singles and their B-sides, produced by various producers such as [[Ian Broudie]] ([[Lightning Seeds]]) and [[Jimmy Miller (producer)|Jimmy Miller]] ([[The Rolling Stones]]) were collected on two albums, ''[[Hit Parade 1]]'' and ''[[Hit Parade 2]]''.

The demand in the United Kingdom for The Wedding Present's singles were so high that distributors began poaching from a separate 5,000-copy stash meant for sale in all other markets to sell in the UK. The Wedding Present had the distinction of having all 12 hit singles be solely original material, whereas Elvis reached his record through archival re-issues. ''The Hit Parade'' effectively served as the band's third album under the RCA contract, and the band played ''Top of the Pops'' four times in the same year.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2011-07-19|title=An interview with David Gedge of The Wedding Present|url=https://www.on-magazine.co.uk/arts/arts-interviews/david-gedge/|access-date=2021-02-04|website=On: Yorkshire Magazine|language=en-GB}}</ref> 

''[[Seamonsters]]'', ''[[Hit Parade 1]]'' and ''[[Hit Parade 2]]'' were released in the [[United States]] in 1991 and 1992 by New York-based pseudo-indie label First Warning Records. Shortly after the 1992 singles scheme had ended, the band announced they were leaving RCA.<ref name="Larkin"/>

===The Island era (1994-1995)===
The band spent most of 1993 taking time off, occasionally playing gigs. A stopgap compilation of three more archive radio sessions, ''[[Peel Sessions 1987-1990]]'', was released by [[Strange Fruit Records|Strange Fruit]]. When they re-emerged in early 1994 with the news that they had signed to [[Island Records]], it was quickly followed by the announcement that Gregory had left the band, due to lack of enthusiasm, and was replaced by [[Darren Belk]].<ref name="Larkin"/> For their next album, The Wedding Present again left for the United States and enlisted [[Steve Fisk]] ([[Screaming Trees]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]). The result was ''[[Watusi (album)|Watusi]]''.<ref name="Larkin"/> The album's songs ranged from warm lo-fi pop ("Gazebo", "Big Rat") to semi-[[psychedelic music|psychedelic]], [[Velvet Underground|Velvets]]-like workouts ("Click Click", "Catwoman").

No further albums were recorded for Island, and the best part of 1995 was spent the same way as 1993: touring, writing new material, no recording. Paul Dorrington decided to quit the band; no replacement was made as Belk doubled on bass and guitar. In the autumn of 1995, The Wedding Present released "Sucker", a self-financed single that was sold at their gigs only (it has since been included on compilation albums). Shortly after, the band signed with independent label [[Cooking Vinyl]].

===The Cooking Vinyl era (1995-1997/99)===
The band, still a three-piece, recorded their newly written material and issued the [[motorcar|car]]-themed six-track mini-album, ''[[Mini (EP)|Mini]]''.<ref name="Larkin"/>  Belk played both guitar and bass on the songs but struggled at the lead instrument. Shortly after releasing the album, [[Jayne Lockey]], who had already sung backing vocals on ''Mini'', was announced as the band's new bass player. Belk decided to quit the band and was replaced by [[Simon Cleave]]. Both Lockey and Cleave were former members of Tse Tse Fly, along with Paul Dorrington and Mark Goodham.

The band still had material from their sabbatical year and went into the studio again to record ''[[Saturnalia (The Wedding Present album)|Saturnalia]]''.<ref name="Larkin"/>  This proved to be the last new material by The Wedding Present for a long time. After playing a number of gigs to support the album, the last one in [[Liverpool]] on 18 January 1997, the band took a long sabbatical.

===Contractual obligations and Cinerama (1997-2004)===
{{main article|Cinerama (band)}}

To fulfill contractual obligations, two more compilations were released by Cooking Vinyl: another Peel sessions volume, ''[[John Peel Sessions 1992-1995]]'' (1998), and ''[[Singles 1995-1997]]'' (1999). Additionally, Strange Fruit offered another radio sessions compilation, ''[[Evening Sessions 1986-1994]]'' (1997), and the band's American label released ''[[Singles 1989-1991]]'' (1999), a 2CD package which added rarities and live tracks.  Gedge recorded an album, ''Va Va Voom'', in 1998 under the [[Cinerama (band)|Cinerama]] band name with his girlfriend, Sally Murrell, and some session musicians. The project became a full-time band.

Following Gedge's split from Murrell in 2003, and with the increasing inclusion of Wedding Present songs in Cinerama's live sets (in previous years Gedge had good-naturedly refused calls from the audience to play Wedding Present songs, frequently replying "that's another band" or "you're at the wrong gig"), Gedge effectively renamed Cinerama in 2004, keeping the line up, reflecting the change in sound over the years to the more familiar territory of The Wedding Present.

===Reformation (2004-2019)===
[[File:The Wedding Present-01.jpg|thumb|250px|The Wedding Present in Barcelona in 2010.]]
News came in early September 2004 that Cinerama would be rebranded as The Wedding Present. The line-up was to be the same as the last line-up of Cinerama, which included Simon Cleave. The first new single, "[[Interstate 5 (The Wedding Present song)|Interstate 5]]", was issued on 15 November 2004, to lead off the new album, ''[[Take Fountain]]'', which was released on 14 February 2005. A second single, "[[I'm From Further North Than You]]", was released on 11 April 2005. Third and final single "[[Ringway to SeaTac]]" was released on 24 October 2005.

All singles, their B-sides and acoustic versions from this period were compiled on the 2006 compilation ''[[Search for Paradise: Singles 2004-5]]''. The release came with a bonus DVD compiling the videos for "Don't Touch That Dial" (a Cinerama single re-recorded for ''[[Take Fountain]]''), "Interstate 5", "I'm From Further North Than You", "Ringway to SeaTac" and others.

The Wedding Present toured [[Europe]] and [[North America]] in the Spring of 2005 (with John Maiden on drums) and again in Europe towards the end of 2005 (this time, with Simon Pearson on drums). During Christmas 2006, guitarist Simon Cleave left the group and was replaced by the group's sound engineer Chris McConville - who played on the 2006 tours of North America (with Charlie Layton on drums) and Europe (with Graeme Ramsay on drums).

Until 2009 the line-up remained stable with Gedge, De Castro, McConville, and Ramsay co-writing. They recorded 17 songs with [[Steve Albini]] in January 2008, some of which have been played live at gigs in recent years. Titles include "I've Lost the Monkey", "Soup", "Drink You Eat You", "Model, Actress, Whatever...", "The Thing I Like Most About Him Is His Girlfriend", "Twenty Jackies", "Swingers", "Peek-a-boo", "Hulk Loves Betty", "Boo Boo", "Palisades", "Santa Ana Winds", "Pinch Pull Twist Release", "The Trouble With Men", "Don't Take Me Home Until I'm Drunk" and "Spider-Man in Hollywood".

The album ''[[El Rey (The Wedding Present album)|El Rey]]'' was released on 20 May 2008 in [[North America]] and 26 May 2008 in [[Europe]], accompanied by the [[music download|digital download]]-only single "The Thing I Like Best About Him Is His Girlfriend". A compilation of singles and remixes ''How The West Was Won'' was released towards the end of 2008 and accompanied by a single "Holly Jolly Hollywood". The Wedding Present also covered [[The Cure]]'s "High" for [[American Laundromat Records]] tribute ''Just Like Heaven - a tribute to The Cure''.

Some months before a short tour of the UK and Japan in March 2009, Chris McConville left the band and was replaced by former guitarist Simon Cleave, who left the band again later that year. Graeme Ramsay subsequently moved from drums to guitar and Charles Layton once again became their drummer.

In 2009 two The Wedding Present songs, "[[I'm From Further North Than You]]", and  "[[Ringway to SeaTac]]" appeared in the award-winning [[Monty Miranda]] directed independent film ''[[Skills Like This]]''.  The director was praised for his use of music in an integrated soundtrack.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/movies/20skil.html | work=The New York Times | title=20-something Sloth and Larceny | first=Jeannette | last=Catsoulis | date=20 March 2009 | access-date=25 May 2010}}</ref>

In August 2010 it was announced that De Castro would not be touring with The Wedding Present for the Autumn 21st anniversary tour of ''Bizarro'', and that her last gig would be at 28 August 2010 at Gedge's mini festival "At the Edge of the Sea" in Brighton. This marked the end of a 12-year association with Gedge, stretching back to when Cinerama was formed. She was replaced by Pepe le Moko.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scopitones.co.uk/news/ |title=News &#124; The Official home of The Wedding Present and Cinerama |publisher=Scopitones.co.uk |access-date=2012-04-03}}</ref>
[[File:The Wedding Present in Valencia 02.jpg|thumb|David Gedge, singer of The Wedding Present in Valencia, Spain. October 2016]]
A new Wedding Present album, ''[[Valentina (The Wedding Present Album)|Valentina]]'' was released in March 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scopitones.co.uk/archives/4017 |title=New Wedding Present album to be released in March &#124; The Official home of The Wedding Present and Cinerama |publisher=Scopitones.co.uk |access-date=2012-04-03}}</ref> Shortly before its release, guitarist Graeme Ramsay left the band after six years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scopitones.co.uk/about/about#lineup |title=The Wedding Present line-ups|website=Scopitones.co.uk |access-date=2012-04-12}}</ref> and was replaced by Patrick Alexander (ex-The Young Playthings and The Pipettes).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.insound.com/The-Wedding-Present/A/19505/# |title=Biography at insound.com |access-date=2012-04-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414181829/http://www.insound.com/The-Wedding-Present/A/19505/ |archive-date=14 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

During 2012, The Wedding Present toured a set which usually featured the whole of ''[[Seamonsters]]'', performed live and in album order. The rest of the set was a mixture of songs from ''[[Valentina (The Wedding Present Album)|Valentina]]'' and the back catalogue. In April of the year, The Wedding Present toured Australia for the first time, playing concerts in Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne.

On 25 October 2012, the ''4 Songs'' Extended Player was released on download only. These four new songs ("Journey Into Space", "Pain Perdu", "1000 Fahrenheit" & "Can You Keep a Secret") recorded during the Valentina sessions could be downloaded following the purchase of 'Valentina: The Story of a Wedding Present, a book documenting the making of the long player itself. Valentina itself was re-released in May 2015 after being re-interpreted and re-recorded by David Gedge's other band Cinerama.

In early 2013 the band started a world tour including taking in the US, Australia and for the first time New Zealand. The Wedding Present played 'George Best' and 'The Hit Parade' in their entirety on this tour celebrating the 25th and 21st 'birthday' of these albums respectively.

The band released their ninth album, ''[[Going, Going...]]'' on 2 September 2016.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pearis|first1=Bill|title=The Wedding Present ready new album 'Going, Going…' (listen to two songs)|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/the-wedding-present-ready-new-album-going-going-listen-to-two-songs/|website=BrooklynVegan|access-date=7 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Wedding Present release new album|url=https://www.scopitones.co.uk/archives/6669|website=Scopitones.co.uk|access-date=12 September 2016|ref=ScopitonesGoing}}</ref>

2017 saw the 30th anniversary of the release of ''[[George Best (album)|George Best]]'', an anniversary tour and a feature-length documentary about the record titled ''The Wedding Present: Something Left Behind''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scopitones.co.uk/archives/7135|title=GEORGE BEST DOCUMENTARY |website=Scopitones.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-25}}</ref>

In mid-2019, the band issued a completely re-recorded version of 1988 compilation ''[[Tommy (The Wedding Present album)|Tommy]]'', plus their first picture disc - a 10" single featuring two new songs.

In late 2019, the band toured playing ''[[Bizarro (album)|Bizarro]]'' in its entirety.  During this tour the band were joined on guitar by Jon Stewart of [[Sleeper (band)|Sleeper]] and Chris Hardwick from [[My Life Story]] on drums.

===Acoustic versions and ''24 Songs'' (2020-present)===
In 2020 during the [[Covid-19 pandemic]], the band recorded various acoustic versions of the bands' tracks, with each musician recording their part of the song from home. The songs were released on the band's social media accounts. Twelve tracks including a duet of a previously unrecorded [[Sleeper (band)|Sleeper]] song called ''We Should Be Together'', recorded as a duet with [[Louise Wener]], were released in February 2021 as ''Locked Down and Stripped Back''.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Wedding Present 'Locked Down and Stripped Back' Upcoming Release |date=21 January 2021 |url=https://www.vivascene.com/the-wedding-present-locked-down-and-stripped-back-upcoming-release/ |publisher=Vivascene |access-date=17 August 2021}}</ref>

In December 2020 the band, and various ex-members and collaborators released an album of [[James Bond]] theme cover versions called ''Not From Where I’m Standing'', for the mental health charity [[Campaign Against Living Miserably]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Richards |first1=Will |title=The Wedding Present to release album of James Bond theme covers in aid of CALM |date=5 October 2020 |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-wedding-present-to-release-album-of-james-bond-theme-covers-in-aid-of-calm-2770984 |publisher=New Musical Express (NME) |access-date=17 August 2021}}</ref>

In April 2021, the band re-released a 30th anniversary version of ''Seamonsters'' including the b-sides to the singles released to promote the original 1991 album and tracks from a [[John Peel Session]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kean |first1=Jon |title=The Wedding Present: Seamonsters (30th Anniversary Reissue) |date=28 May 2021 |url=https://louderthanwar.com/the-wedding-present-seamonsters-30th-anniversary-reissue/ |publisher=Louder Than Bombs |access-date=17 August 2021}}</ref>

In October 2021, the band announced that in 2022 they would release a 7" single per month, featuring 2 new songs, for the duration of 2022, repeating their one single per month approach of 1992.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Taylor |first1=Tom |title=The Wedding Present to release two songs a month in 2022 |date=15 October 2021 |url=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/the-wedding-present-to-release-two-songs-a-month/ |publisher=Far Out Magazine |access-date=20 October 2021}}</ref> This ''24 Songs'' project will see songs written by David Gedge and Sleeper guitarist Jon Stewart, collaborating together to write tracks for the first time in the band's history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://superdeluxeedition.com/news/the-wedding-present-24-songs/|title = The Wedding Present / 24 Songs – SuperDeluxeEdition}}</ref>
