'''William Robert Young''' (born 20 January 1979) is a British actor and singer-songwriter who came to prominence after winning the 2002 [[Pop Idol (series 1)|inaugural series]] of the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] talent contest ''[[Pop Idol]]'', making him the first winner of the worldwide ''[[Idol series|Idol]]'' franchise. His double A-sided debut single "[[Anything Is Possible (Will Young song)|Anything Is Possible]]" / "[[Evergreen (Westlife song)#Will Young version|Evergreen]]" was released two weeks after the show's finale and became the fastest-selling debut single in the UK. Young also came in fifth place in ''[[World Idol]]'' performing the single "[[Light My Fire]]" written by the band [[the Doors]].

As a teenager, Young studied politics at the [[University of Exeter]] before moving to London, where he studied musical theatre at [[Arts Educational Schools, London|Arts Educational School]]. Young put his studies on hold in late 2001 to become a contestant on ''Pop Idol''. After winning the competition the following year, he released his debut album ''[[From Now On (Will Young album)|From Now On]]'' (2002) which went straight to number one. ''[[Friday's Child (album)|Friday's Child]]'' (2003) followed and enjoyed greater success, eventually going platinum five times in the UK and spawning three top five singles. His following albums ''[[Keep On]]'' (2005), ''[[Let It Go (Will Young album)|Let It Go]]'' (2008) and ''[[Echoes (Will Young album)|Echoes]]'' (2011) also went multi-platinum and ''[[85% Proof]]'' (2015) became his fourth UK number-one album. His albums have spawned many songs that have achieved top ten positions in the UK, four of which went to the number one spot. Young has also undertaken numerous concert tours, and has accumulated multiple honours, including two [[Brit Awards]] from 12 nominations, and the estimated worldwide sale of over eight million albums.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6783/is_2009_Nov_6/ai_n42030521/ |work=Evening Chronicle |title=Pop idol proves he's got longevity; Will Young is in Toon this month.

Alongside his music career, Young has acted in film, on stage and in television. For his performance in the [[2013 Laurence Olivier Awards|2013]] [[London stage|London]] revival of the musical ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'', he was nominated for the [[Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical|Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role in a Musical]].

== Early life and education ==

=== Early life and family ===
Young was born on 20 January 1979 in [[Wokingham]], [[Berkshire]], and is the second-oldest child of Robin Young, a [[company director]] of an engineering firm, and Annabel Young (née Griffith), a [[plant nursery]] gardener. Born six weeks prematurely, he was ten minutes older than his twin brother, Rupert (died August 2020).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2020/08/03/will-young-twin-brother-dies-13079157/ |title=Will Young heartbroken as his twin brother Rupert dies aged 41 |first=Alicia|last=Adejobi|date=August 3, 2020|access-date=August 4, 2020}}</ref> He also has an older sister Emma.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McPhee |first1=Erica |title=Will Young: The Biography |year=2005 |publisher=Michael O'Mara Books |location=London, UK |isbn=1-84317-175-9 |page=14}}</ref><ref>Young; Giddings (2002) p. 13.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/2462360/Rupert-Young-struggled-in-the-shadow-of-brother-Will-Youngs-success.html |title=Rupert Young struggled in the shadow of brother Will Young's success |first=Roya |last=Nikkhah |work=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=11 October 2016}}</ref>

Young was born into an affluent, middle-class family, whose paternal ancestry has strong ties to the British government and military services.<ref name="McP 63">McPhee (2005) p. 63.</ref> His grandfather, Digby Aretas Young (d. 1966) served in the Royal Air Force,<ref name="McP 63"/> and his great-great-great-great grandfather was Colonel Sir [[Aretas William Young]],<ref name="McP 63" /> who, in 1795 at seventeen years old, joined the [[British Army]] and served in Ireland and [[Egypt]] before fighting in the [[Peninsular War]]. Aretas was later stationed in [[Trinidad]] and eventually took charge of the Trinidadian government, before moving to [[Demerara]] where he was appointed Protector of Slaves. Aretas became the sixth [[Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island|Governor]] of [[Prince Edward Island]] in 1831, and three years later was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] by [[King William IV]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Prince Edward Island Governors, Lieutenant Governors and Administrators 1769 to May 2009 |year=2009 |publisher=Elections P.E.I. |location=Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island |page=9 |chapter=Hon.

=== Education ===
Young was brought up in [[Hungerford]], [[West Berkshire]], and was initially educated at Kingsbury Hill School in [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]], [[Wiltshire]], before attending [[Horris Hill School|Horris Hill Preparatory School]], [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]], between the ages of eight and thirteen.<ref>McPhee (2005) pp. 16–17.</ref> His first appearance on stage was at the age of four when he played a [[fir tree]] in a school production and had one line to speak.<ref>McPhee (2005) p.16.</ref> At Horris Hill, Young was head chorister in the school choir, and at the age of nine he learned how to play the piano.<ref>McPhee (2005) p.17.</ref> Young recalls that at Horris Hill, pupils were taught that they were more privileged than pupils from [[state school]]s, and that one day he wrote a letter stating, "I must pass [[Common Entrance Examination|common entrance]] to take me to public school, otherwise I'll be going to state school and everyone will be very disappointed."<ref name=schooldays>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/schools/my-schooldays-will-young-singer-1625513.html |title=My Schooldays: Will Young, Singer |first=Simon |last=Jablonski |date=19 February 2009 |work=The Independent |location=London, UK |access-date=12 February 2010}}</ref> At thirteen, Young and his brother were enrolled at [[Wellington College, Berkshire|Wellington College]] in [[Crowthorne]], Berkshire, a [[public school (privately funded)|public]] [[boarding school]].<ref name="McPhee 2005. p. 17">McPhee (2005). p. 17.</ref> Young appeared in several school productions and often gave speeches in assembly, despite later admitting that he never felt completely comfortable being the centre of attention.<ref name="McPhee 2005 p. 18">McPhee (2005) p. 18</ref>

It was during this period that he became interested in sports and for a time he dreamed of competing in the [[Olympic Games]] in the [[400 metre sprint]], which he could run in under fifty seconds&nbsp;– the Olympic average is forty-three seconds.<ref name="McPhee 2005. p. 17"/> He became captain of the school's [[basketball]] and athletics teams, and also represented the school in the triple jump, long jump, football and rugby.<ref name="McPhee 2005 p. 18"/> The only sport he says he felt uncomfortable playing was cricket.<ref name="McPhee 2005. p. 17"/>

Young left school with ten [[GCSE]]s,<ref name="McPhee 2005 p. 18"/> but achieved disappointing [[A-Level]] results and had to enroll in [[D'Overbroeck's College]], Oxford, to re-sit his exams.

In September 2001 he became a student at the [[Arts Educational Schools, London|Arts Educational Schools]], in [[Chiswick]], London.<ref>McPhee (2005) p. 24</ref>

== Career ==

=== 1999–2001: Early auditions and ''Pop Idol'' ===
{{See also|Pop Idol (series 1)}}
In 1999 during his second year at university, Young watched an episode of ''[[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]'' and learned that the show was holding a competition to find members for a new [[boy band]]. He mailed the producers an audition tape and received a letter back from the show telling him he had been selected as one of seventy-five competitors, and that he had to appear in London for an off-camera audition.<ref name="McP 22">McPhee (2005) p.22</ref> The 75 auditionees were whittled down to 9 finalists including Young, who were then invited to perform on the show. On 29 May 1999, Young appeared on the programme and performed a short rendition of [[the Jackson 5]] song, ''[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]]'',<ref>{{Cite episode |title=''This Morning'' |episode-link=This Morning (TV series)|series=This Morning |credits=[[Richard Madeley]], [[Judy Finnigan]] (presenters) |network=[[ITV1|ITV]] |airdate=29 May 1999}}</ref> in front of a panel of judges that included [[Simon Cowell]], an [[artists and repertoire]] executive at [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowell |first1=Simon |author-link1=Simon Cowell |title=I Don't Mean To Be Rude, But... |year=2003 |publisher=Broadway Books |location=New York |isbn=0767917413 |url=https://archive.org/details/idontmeantoberud00cowe }}</ref> and [[Kate Thornton]], a former editor of ''[[Smash Hits]]'', turned television presenter.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4673136.stm |title=Smash Hits magazine closing down |date=2 February 2006 |work=BBC News |access-date=14 February 2010}}</ref> One week later, Young was selected into the boy band alongside three other competitors. They were [[Lee Ryan]] who later joined the boy band [[Blue (English band)|Blue]], [[Declan Bennett]] who joined the boy band [[Point Break (band)|Point Break]], signed to [[Danielle Barnett]], the current lead singer of [[Urban Cookie Collective]] and Music Manager who contacted him directly following the This Morning audition, and [[Andy Scott-Lee]] who went on to compete in the second series of ''[[Pop Idol]]''.<ref>Young (2002) p. 9</ref><ref>{{Cite episode |title=''This Morning'' |episode-link=This Morning (TV series)|series=This Morning |credits=[[Richard Madeley]], [[Judy Finnigan]] (presenters) |network=[[ITV1|ITV]] |airdate=6 June 1999}}</ref><ref>{{Cite episode |title=''This Morning'' |episode-link=This Morning (TV series) |series=This Morning|credits=[[Philip Schofield]], [[Holly Willoughby]] (presenters) |network=[[ITV1|ITV]] |airdate=3 October 2013 |minutes=45}}</ref> Cowell said of the group, "We've tried to find people with star quality and these guys can sing and dance",<ref name="McP 23">McPhee (2005) p. 23.</ref> but the band failed to find any success and it soon dis-banded.<ref name="McP 23" /> Young's next audition was at the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] in London to be a jazz singer, but he accidentally arrived on the wrong date.<ref>Young (2002) p.10</ref>

On 20 June 2001, one of Young's university classmates showed him an advertisement in the ''[[News of the World]]'' for auditionees of ''[[Pop Idol]]'', a planned nationwide televised talent show to find a solo pop artist in a similar way that ''[[Popstars]]'' had created the pop band [[Hear'Say]] the previous year.<ref name="Young15–65">Young (2002) pp. 15–16</ref> The winner was guaranteed a [[GBP|£]]1&nbsp;million recording contract with [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] and representation by [[19 Management]].<ref>McPhee (2005) p.54.</ref> He printed out an application form from the website, filled it out and posted it on 28 June.<ref name="Young15–65" /> On 7 August 2001, he received a reply which told him he had been accepted for an audition at [[ExCeL London]] on 5 September 2001.<ref>Young (2002) p. 18</ref> On the day of the audition, Young performed [[Aretha Franklin]]'s "[[Until You Come Back to Me (That's What I'm Gonna Do)]]" in front of an assistant producer, and was deemed good enough to be given a second audition two days later.<ref>Young (2002) pp. 21–22.</ref> For his second audition, Young sang "[[Blame It on the Boogie]]" by the Jacksons in front of a show producer and won a place to the third round to perform before the show's judges:<ref>Young (2002) p. 23</ref> Simon Cowell; [[Nicki Chapman]], a ''Popstars'' judge who also worked as a publicist at [[19 Entertainment]], the company that was producing ''Pop Idol''; [[Pete Waterman]], a music producer who had written or produced twenty-one singles that had charted at Number One in the [[UK Singles Chart]], 200 Top Tens, and sold over 500 million records for the artists such as [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Rick Astley]], [[Bananarama]], [[Steps (group)|Steps]] and [[Westlife]]; and [[Neil Fox (media personality)|Neil "Dr Fox" Fox]], a disc jockey who presented the [[drivetime]] show on [[95.8 Capital FM|Capital FM]] and the nationally syndicated [[Pepsi Chart (UK)|Pepsi Chart]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Solanas |first1=Siân |title=Pop Idol: The Official Inside Story of the ITV Series |year=2002 |publisher=Carlton Books |location=London, UK |isbn=1842225367 |pages=8–9}}</ref> He was the final contestant the judges saw, and after a day of watching mostly poor performances they were not in the best spirits. Again, Young performed "Blame It on the Boogie", but the judges thought his overall performance was merely average. Chapman told him that his dance moves had let him down, but his vocal was good. Fox described him as [[camp (style)|cheesy]], Waterman was unimpressed by his stage presence and image&nbsp;– Young was wearing baggy and faded jeans, scuffed shoes and his grandfather's jumper which was stained with egg yolk&nbsp;– but conceded that his voice was "nice". Despite their uncertainty, however, they advanced him through to the next round.<ref name=audition>{{Cite episode |title=Open Auditions 5 |series=Pop Idol |series-link=Pop Idol |network=[[ITV1|ITV]] |airdate=20 October 2001 |series-no=[[Pop Idol (series 1)|1]] |number=5}}</ref> The following week, auditions were held at the [[Criterion Theatre]], and Young sang "[[All or Nothing (O-Town song)|All or Nothing]]" by [[O-Town]], [[the Drifters]]' "[[Up on the Roof (song)|Up on the Roof]]" and "[[Fast Love]]" by [[George Michael]]. Still not completely convinced by his performances, he was made to wait in the "Maybe" room until the judges decided to send him through to the Final 50.<ref>Young (2002) pp. 27–35.</ref><ref>McPhee (2005) pp. 29–31.</ref>

The first episode of ''Pop Idol'' was broadcast on 6 October 2001 on [[ITV1|ITV]], and Young's audition aired on the third show on 20 October 2001.<ref name=audition /> The next round of the competition was split into five heats that aired every Saturday between 3 November 2001 and 8 December 2001. Each show featured ten of the fifty competitors singing one song in the ''Pop Idol'' studios in front of the judges and an audience, but unlike previous rounds, the viewing public decided who would advance to the next round by [[interactive television|interactive]] [[televoting]] voting using their telephones, the [[Red Button (digital television)|Red Button]] on [[digital television]] [[remote control]]s, and the ''Pop Idol'' website. The two singers with the highest number of votes in each heat advanced to the final rounds of the competition. Young competed in Heat 4, broadcast on 24 November,<ref>Solanas (2002) pp. 26–27</ref> and sang a jazz/[[lounge music|lounge]] interpretation of "[[Light My Fire]]" by [[the Doors]].<ref>Young (2002) pp. 60–66.</ref> Judges Chapman, Fox and Waterman were all enthusiastic about his performance, but Cowell was unimpressed and called it "distinctly average," adding, "I just thought it was totally normal. In the context of the show I honestly didn't think it was good enough."<ref>Young (2002) p. 67</ref> The other judges and contestants all expressed shock at his comments, and Young responded, telling Cowell that while he was entitled to his opinion, it was wrong.<ref name="Young p68" />

In today's times it's so much easier and accepted to occupy other genders, ideas and explore new avenues. I wanted to understand what it might be like to sing their lyrics. A song about a boy called Daniel; crying on the bathroom floor, feeling like Elizabeth Taylor. This is not a covers album as such, well certainly not in the standard way. I wanted to bring songs from female artists who I admire into a new arena. I wanted to work with Richard X again and create a true pop record."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.clashmusic.com/news/will-young-announces-new-album-crying-on-the-bathroom-floor|title=Will Young Announces New Album 'Crying On The Bathroom Floor'|work=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]|last=Murray|first=Robin|date=26 April 2021|access-date=27 April 2021}}</ref>
