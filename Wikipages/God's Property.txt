'''God's Property''' was a [[Gospel music|gospel]] choir known for its collaborations with [[Kirk Franklin]] and other recording artists.

==Musical career==
God's Property Choir was organized and founded by a public school music teacher by the name of Linda Ray Hall-Searight in 1992 in Dallas, Texas. She and her son, Grammy Award Winner Robert Sput Searight, and daughters, Robin and Rachella Searight, were totally responsible for recruiting all of the original singers and musicians of this choir. Linda Searight groomed the choir into an exceptional performing organization that was often featured on national television shows in the mid and late 1990s. The choir began to collaborate with [[Kirk Franklin]] in 1994 and sang backup on his 1995 album, ''Whatcha Looking' 4''. Franklin, in turn, produced and co-wrote most of the songs on the group's 1997 album (also produced by Scott "Shavoni" Parker and Buster & Kevin Bond).<ref name="jet1998">{{cite web|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n23_v94/ai_21256447|title=God's Property sues Kirk Franklin|date=1998-11-02 |access-date=2007-11-08|work=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet Magazine]]}}</ref> [[Kirk Franklin]] often works out new material with the choir in the studio and has appeared with the choir on the [[Late Show with David Letterman]].  The choir itself has performed with [[Celine Dion]] at the encore of the "Call The Man/Power of the Dream" concert in [[Dallas, Texas]] and on The 10th Annual [[Essence Awards]] in 1997 with [[Stevie Wonder]].<ref name="RDLFA">{{cite web|url=http://www.delafont.com/music_acts/kirk-franklin.htm|title=Kirk Franklin, Richard De La Font Agency, Inc.|access-date=2006-11-18}}</ref> In 1998, a few of God's Property singers performed a few songs for Kirk Franklin's [[The Nu Nation Project]].

On November 2, 1998, God's Property sued their record label. The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles [[Superior Court]], alleges that Franklin's parent label executives Vickie Mack induced God's Property founder Linda Searight into signing an "onerous and one-sided" contract with [[GospoCentric Records|B-Rite Music]].<ref name="jet1998"/>
