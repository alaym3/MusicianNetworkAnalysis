'''Flaw''' is an American [[nu metal]] band from [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. The band was formed by guitarist Jason Daunt in 1996. After a string of rough independent recordings in the 1990s, the band signed to [[Republic Records|Republic]] and [[Universal Music Group]] and released two [[record label|major label albums]], ''[[Through the Eyes]]'' in 2001 and ''[[Endangered Species (Flaw album)|Endangered Species]]'' in 2004. Breakups, line-up changes, and internal strife plagued the band for the rest of the decade, though from 2015 to 2017, the band reformed with three of their core members to tour and write music. The band released their third studio album, ''[[Divided We Fall (album)|Divided We Fall]]'', in 2016. Their latest album, ''[[Vol IV: Because of the Brave]]'', was released in 2019. The band's lineup frequently shifts; lead vocalist [[Chris Volz]] is the only constant member.

==History==
===Formation and early independent releases (1996–2000)===
Flaw was formed in 1996<ref name="allmusic"/> when lead vocalist [[Chris Volz]] answered an ad in a local paper placed by guitarist Jason Daunt, looking for a lead vocalist for a band.<ref name="allmusic"/> Volz met with Daunt shortly after, with Volz bringing a demo tape containing some examples of his recorded vocals.<ref name="DRR"/> The meeting went well, with the two starting the writing process for Flaw material that night, and completing their first song, "Inner Strength", the next day.<ref name="DRR"/> The band's rhythm section progressed through several line-ups but solidified with the addition of bassist Ryan Jurhs in 1997.<ref name="allmusic"/> That same year the band recorded their first release, the independent ''American Arrogance''.<ref name="allmusic"/> Because they were low on money, the band ordered everything they needed to record from the [[Musician's Friend]] catalog, then returned it using the 30-day return policy. Their album gave them the opportunity to open for acts including [[Fear Factory]] and [[Econoline Crush]].<ref name="allmusic"/> A local radio station, [[The Fox (brand)|The Fox]], broadcast the songs from Flaw's indie disc, giving them further publicity. Two more independent releases, 1998's self-titled album ''Flaw'' and 2000's ''Drama'' [[extended play|EP]], were later produced as well,<ref name="blabbermouth2013"/> while the band's first stable line-up, including Lance Arny as a second guitarist, and Chris Ballinger on drums, was established in 1999.<ref name="allmusic"/>

===''Through the Eyes'' and ''Endangered Species'' (2001–2004)===
Flaw showcased at [[CBGB]] in [[New York City]] and were heard by [[Republic Records|Republic]] and [[Universal Music Group]].<ref name="allmusic"/> Flaw signed to the label in 2000, and began recording their first studio album in early 2001 at [[Sound City Studios|Sound City]] with [[music producer]] [[David Bottrill]].<ref name="allmusic"/> The finished product, ''[[Through the Eyes]]'', released in October 2001.<ref name="allmusic"/> The album topped the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top Heatseekers]] chart,<ref name="blabbermouth2013">{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/original-flaw-lineup-reunites/ |title=Original Flaw Lineup Reunites |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=November 19, 2013 |access-date=February 10, 2016}}</ref> and peaked at No.&nbsp;119 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/302215/flaw/chart |title=Flaw - Chart history |publisher=Billboard |access-date=September 1, 2015}}</ref> In promotion of the album, the band released two singles, "[[Payback (Flaw song)|Payback]]" and "Whole", and played the 2002 iteration of [[Ozzfest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/flaw-prepares-to-invade-europe-as-through-the-eyes-holds-strong-on-billboard-charts-band-joins-ozzfest-lineup-july-6-77304087.html |title=FLAW Prepares to Invade Europe as 'Through The Eyes' Holds Strong on... - re> NEW YORK, May 7 /PRNewswire/ |publisher=Prnewswire.com |access-date=September 1, 2015}}</ref> Another track, "Only the Strong," was also featured on ''[[The Scorpion King]]'' soundtrack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1451812/creed-nickelback-system-of-a-down-on-scorpion-king-soundtrack/ |title=Creed, Nickelback, System of a Down On 'Scorpion King' Soundtrack |publisher=MTV}} ''January 16, 2002''</ref>

===Breakups, side-projects, and internal strife (2005–2012)===

While the band initially had intentions on recording new material and releasing it, internal issues among members lead to many delays and hurdles.<ref name="blabbermouth.net"/> Progress slowed as Volz's focus turned to his solo work, recording and touring in support of his studio album ''[[Redemption (Chris Volz album)|Redemption]]'' across September and October 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/flaw-frontman-chris-volz-hits-the-road/ |title=Flaw Frontman Chris Volz Hits The Road |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=October 8, 2007 |access-date=February 10, 2016}}</ref> Additional complications occurred by the start of 2008, with Volz and Daunt breaking off to form a new band called Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=36240 |title=Flaw Frontman Forms New Band, Foundation - in Metal News |publisher=Metalunderground.com |access-date=February 10, 2016}}</ref> The offshoot played a number of shows through 2008,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tunelab.com/2008/07/20/foundation-add-new-tour-dates/ |title=Foundation Add New Tour Dates &#124; tunelab™ |publisher=Tunelab.com |date=July 20, 2008 |access-date=February 10, 2016}}</ref> but eventually returned to just performing as Flaw, as people became confused between the two considering the similar members and setlists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tunelab.com/2008/08/27/foundation-change-name-back-to-flaw/ |title=Foundation Change Name Back To Flaw &#124; tunelab™ |publisher=Tunelab.com |date=August 27, 2008 |access-date=February 10, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104830/http://tunelab.com/2008/08/27/foundation-change-name-back-to-flaw/ |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Still, the band continued to struggle with lineup changes, including short term stints with guitarist Nathan McDaniel,<ref name="tloss"/> bassist Jimmie Stalings,<ref name="t2009"/> and drummer Terry Harper.<ref name="tloss">{{cite web |url=http://tunelab.com/2008/12/29/flaw-lose-guitarist/ |title=Flaw Lose Guitarist &#124; tunelab™ |publisher=Tunelab.com |date=December 29, 2008 |access-date=February 10, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305170503/http://tunelab.com/2008/12/29/flaw-lose-guitarist/ |archive-date=March 5, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In March 2018, the band and their crowd funding campaign for a new tour van became the subject of a running joke on ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'', culminating in the band's appearance on the show in July 2018, in which [[Stephen Colbert]] presented them with a used tour van. The band also shot a music video during their appearance for their single "Conquer This Climb" featuring Colbert off of their upcoming ''Vol. IV'' album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2018/03/29/stephen-colbert-name-drops-flaw-on-the-late-show-increases-flaw-band-google-searches-8-trillion-percent/|title=Stephen Colbert Name Drops Flaw on The Late Show, Increases 'Flaw Band' Google Searches 8 Trillion Percent|date=March 29, 2018|website=MetalSucks.net|access-date=1 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2018/07/30/stephen-colbert-bought-flaw-a-15000-van/|title=Stephen Colbert Bought Flaw a $15,000 Van|date=July 30, 2018|website=MetalSucks.net|access-date=1 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv1YQjmJtOo|title=Flaw "Conquer This Climb"|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/flaw-new-van-stephen-colbert-conquer-this-climb-video/|title=Flaw Get New Van From Stephen Colbert, Shoot New Video|first=Chad|last=Childers|website=Loudwire.com|access-date=1 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-news/watch-stephen-colbert-buy-new-tour-van-for-nu-metal-band-704571/|title=Watch Stephen Colbert Buy New Tour Van for Nu-Metal Band|first1=Daniel|last1=Kreps|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=July 28, 2018|access-date=1 August 2019}}</ref>

''Vol IV: Because of the Brave'' was released on July 19, 2019.
