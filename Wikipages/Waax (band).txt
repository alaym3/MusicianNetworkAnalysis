'''Waax''' (stylised as '''WAAX'''; pronounced "wax") are an Australian rock band from [[Brisbane]], formed in 2012. The band consists of guitarists James Gatling and Ewan Birtwell, drummer Tom Bloomfield, bassist Tom Griffin, and vocalist Marie 'Maz' DeVita. Waax have released two independent EPs: ''[[Holy Sick]]'' (2015) and ''Wild & Weak'' (2017). Their debut album, ''[[Big Grief]]'', was released in 2019. They also won the [[Triple J Unearthed]] BIGSOUND competition in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.triplejunearthed.com/artist/waax|title=WAAX|publisher=[[Triple J Unearthed]]|accessdate=17 December 2018}}</ref> Their single "Labrador" won the No. 1 spot on the independent Brisbane radio station [[4ZZZ]]'s Top 100 in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/4zzzradio/status/1080040848086028290|title=4ZZZ - "#ZedHot100 2018 #01 WAAX @waaxband "Labrador" CONGRATS!

==History==
===Early years and ''Holy Sick'' (2012–2015)===
Waax was formed in June 2012 by Marie DeVita on vocals, bass and keys; Elijah Gall on lead guitar; Ewan Birtwell on rhythm guitar; and Tom Bloomfield on drums. Shortly after forming, DeVita moved into a strictly vocal role, and the band recruited Ariana Pelser as their full-time bassist.

Their debut single "Wisdom Teeth", released on 23 May 2014, earned the band a spot on the Triple J Unearthed stage at that year's BIGSOUND festival and lifted the band to national prominence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.aaabackstage.com/movies/6369-waax-release-debut-single.html|title=WAAX Release Debut Single|publisher=AAA Backstage|accessdate=26 February 2019}}</ref>

Pelser left the band in February 2015, followed by Gall shortly thereafter. The pair were replaced with Tom Griffin on bass and Chris Antolak on lead guitar. Waax's next single, "I For an Eye", was released in June and added to the band's popularity. An accompanying music video was released a month later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iNf-1Gfq_s|title=WAAX - I For An Eye - (Official Video)|author=WAAX|date=15 July 2015|accessdate=25 February 2019|via=YouTube}}</ref> Their newfound visibility in the mainstream also landed them opportunities to perform as a support act for Australian bands such as [[Kingswood (band)|Kingswood]], The Delta Riggs, [[Ecca Vandal]], Emperors and [[Stonefield (band)|Stonefield]], and international bands like [[Guitar Wolf]] and [[Upset (band)|Upset]].

Throughout their touring, the band found time to record and release their first EP, ''[[Holy Sick]]''. The EP was released to SoundCloud on 29 September 2014 with no prior announcement. The EP was met with praise from fans and positive reviews from critics. On 14 December, the EP was made commercially available as a digital download and on CD.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://waax.bandcamp.com/album/holy-sick-ep|title=Holy Sick EP {{!}} WAAX|website=BandCamp|date=14 December 2015|accessdate=17 July 2019}}</ref> Also in December, the band embarked on their first headlining tour throughout Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.aaabackstage.com/reviews/7936-review-waax-debut-ep-holy-sick.html|title=Review: WAAX Debut EP "Holy Sick"|first=Jack|last=Doonar|publisher=AAA Backstage|accessdate=26 February 2019}}</ref>

===Restructuring and ''Wild & Weak'' (2016–2017)===
After a brief period of restructuring, Waax released the single "Same Same" on 21 November 2016, with a music video following on 6 February 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeh3iM2DcT0|title=WAAX - Same Same (Official Video)|author=WAAX|date=6 February 2017|accessdate=9 July 2019|via=YouTube}}</ref> Another single, "Nothing Is Always", was released on 8 March,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://waax.bandcamp.com/track/nothing-is-always|title=Nothing is Always {{!}} WAAX|website=Bandcamp|date=8 March 2017|accessdate=9 July 2019}}</ref> followed shortly thereafter by the title track from their second EP, ''Wild & Weak''. The EP was released independently on 7 June. Drummer Tom Bloomfield described the band's new sound as "something spicy, like a really hot burrito".<ref name="LunchBox" /> To promote the release of the EP, the band performed a ten-date national tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wallofsoundau.com/2017/06/24/get-wild-weak-with-waax/|title=Get 'Wild & Weak' with WAAX|first=Paul|last=Brown|publisher=Wall of Sound|date=24 June 2017|accessdate=25 February 2019}}</ref>

===Antolak's departure and ''Big Grief'' (2018–present)===
During [[Fall Out Boy]]'s Australian ''Mania'' tour, Waax opened for them as a support band at four shows from February to March 2018.<ref name="Overdrive" /> Signing a label deal with Universal imprint [[Dew Process]], Waax released their single "Labrador" on 27 April, a month after announcing they would perform a twelve-date national tour in its support.
