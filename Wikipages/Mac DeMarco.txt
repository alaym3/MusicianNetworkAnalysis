In October 2021, DeMarco returned to live performances following a hiatus due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].

Andy White confirmed his departure shortly afterwards stating: "Mac’s an old friend, life is long, and no one knows the future. I'm incredibly stoked to see his new line-up soon as I can. I loved his band before I was in it. I loved playing in it, and I will always look forward to what our bud is putting together in the future."<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2021-10-19|title=Tonstartssbandht AMA|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/qif34y/tonstartssbandht_ama/|access-date=2021-11-01|website=reddit|language=en}}</ref>

==Artistry==
DeMarco's style employs the use of flat drums (little or no [[reverberation]] or [[dynamic range compression]]), [[Chorus effect|chorus]] and [[vibrato]] effects on the guitar and a generally lazy atmosphere ''a la'' [[soft rock]] records, muted and low frequency bass guitars. He has mentioned [[Shuggie Otis]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[Christopher Cross]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Jonathan Richman]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and [[Weezer]] as favourite artists.<ref name=PFORK2>{{cite web|last=Minsker|first=Evan|title=Mac DeMarco|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/guest-lists/8956-mac-demarco/|website=Guest Lists|publisher=Pitchfork Media|access-date=November 24, 2012}}</ref> He has also cited Japanese musician [[Haruomi Hosono]] as his favourite artist.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mac DeMarco's Favorite Artist Is YMO's Haruomi Hosono (2017 Interview) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6L1FtDroaU |website=[[YouTube]] |publisher=art/research |date=July 17, 2017 |access-date=November 14, 2018}}</ref> DeMarco's music has been generally termed as [[Indie rock]],<ref name="timeout">{{cite web | url=https://www.timeout.com/los-angeles/music/fyf-2013-artist-spotlight-mac-demarco | title=FYF 2013 artist spotlight: Mac DeMarco | publisher=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] | date=February 21, 2013 | access-date=August 4, 2014 | author=Lynch, Marley}}</ref> [[psychedelic rock]],<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Kelly |last= Dearmore |title= Six Stellar Artist-Curated Festivals |date= October 5, 2015 |magazine= [[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |url= https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/10/six-stellar-artist-curated-festivals.html |access-date= July 23, 2016}}</ref> [[jangle pop]],<ref name="timeout"/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.spin.com/reviews/mac-demarco-salad-days/ | title=Mac DeMarco is the Slacker With a Heart of Gold on the Endearing 'Salad Days' | publisher=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] | date=April 1, 2014 | access-date=August 4, 2014 | author=Mapes, Jillian}}</ref> and [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/lo-fi-master-mac-demarco-comes-to-tel-aviv/|title=Lo-fi master Mac DeMarco comes to Tel Aviv|website=timesofisrael.com|access-date=February 24, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Hood |first1=Bryan |title=VIDEO: An Interview with Lo-Fi Rocker Mac DeMarco |url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/839598/video-an-interview-with-lo-fi-rocker-mac-demarco |website=Blouinartinfo.com |access-date=May 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20170506175847/http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/839598/video-an-interview-with-lo-fi-rocker-mac-demarco |archive-date= May 6, 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref> His guitar-based compositions have moved from [[Glam rock|glam]]-inspired works to what reviewers describe as "off-kilter pop"<ref name="SP" /> or "folk rock".<ref name="EBSCO">[http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=1&sid=13a0fc29-fbe2-4f83-9906-754429fa0521@sessionmgr101&hid=104&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ==#AN=109303439&db=mah]{{dead link|date=May 2017}}</ref> DeMarco has self identified his style as "jizz jazz", going as far as naming his apartment studio Jizz Jazz Studios, as mentioned in a documentary starring himself, ''Pepperoni Playboy''.<ref name="Pepperoni Playboy">{{cite web|title=Pepperoni Playboy|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4081794/|website=IMDb.com|access-date=September 27, 2017}}</ref> DeMarco has pointed to artists such as [[John Maus]], [[Ariel Pink]], [[Brian Eno]], [[Daniel Lopatin]], [[Isao Tomita]] and [[R.

=== Equipment ===
[[File:Mac Demarco (13298382523) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|DeMarco performing with his [[Teisco]] electric guitar (2013)]]
DeMarco uses vintage equipment and gear for his music. He mainly played on a $30 [[Teisco]] electric guitar that was already in poor condition, and stopped playing it live since it would often break apart.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://the-editorialmagazine.com/a-conversation-with-mac-demarco/|title=The Editorial MagazineA Conversation with Mac Demarco - The Editorial Magazine|website=The-editorialmagazine.com|language=en-US|access-date=May 16, 2018}}</ref> He additionally uses [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] guitars, such as a 1970s [[Fender Stratocaster|Stratocaster]], a 1960s [[Fender Mustang|Mustang]], a 1990s [[Squier]] Stratocaster and an HSS Shawbucker Stratocaster, of which his live band were given 11 as a result of an endorsement deal with Fender.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.mixdownmag.com.au/gear-rundown-mac-demarco-0|title=Gear Rundown: Mac DeMarco|work=Mixdown|access-date=May 16, 2018|language=en}}</ref> His bass guitar mainly used for recording is a Teisco/Stagg bass.<ref name=":0" />

He uses vintage Japanese synthesizers, including a [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] [[Yamaha DX7|DX7]] and a [[Korg]] Microsampler. Additional models include a [[Rhodes piano]], a [[Moog synthesizer|Moog]] Realistic MG-1, a [[Sequential Circuits Prophet-5|Prophet 5]], a [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] [[Roland Juno-60|Juno 60]], JX-3P, and a Yamaha DX100.<ref>{{Citation|last=Stingray Music|title=Mac Demarco describes his perfect woman and writing process @ Osheaga 2014|date=August 29, 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB_Wlqy7NWY|access-date=May 16, 2018}}</ref> Amplifiers used include a 1970s Fender Twin Reverb, a Roland JC-120, and both a small Fender Vibro-Champ and a large Roland KC-550; DeMarco uses them during stage performances by hooking his keyboards with the vibro-champ amplifier which was linked to the KC-550.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bombmagazine.org/articles/mac-demarco|title=Mac DeMarco by Gary Canino - BOMB Magazine|website=Bombmagazine.org|access-date=May 16, 2018}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> Effect pedals used are a [[MXR]] Micro-Amp, a Boss CE-2 Chorus, a Boss VB-2 Vibrato, TU-3 tuner, an Electro-Harmonix Holy Grail Reverb, an [[Electro-Harmonix|EHX]] Polyphonic Octave Generator and a [[JHS Pedals]] Colour Box for overdrive tones.

DeMarco records his music on reel-to-reel tape recorders, such as a [[Fostex]] A-8, a Tascam 388, an [[Alesis]] Micro Limiter and a Roland Space Echo RE-201.<ref name=":0" /> However, he recorded his album ''[[This Old Dog]]'' on a [[MacBook]] with an [[Apogee Electronics|Apogee]] Quartet interface. He uses a Neumann U87 condenser mic, a Royer R-121 ribbon mic, and a four channel Neve Portico preamp strip with his [[Ableton Live|Ableton]] setup. DeMarco also uses a [[Roland CR-78]] drum machine to record demos.<ref name=reeltoreel />

==Personal life==
From around 2012, DeMarco resided in [[Queens, New York]]. In late 2016, he moved with his girlfriend, Kierra McNally, to the [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles|Silver Lake]] neighborhood in [[Los Angeles]], where he has resided since and regularly hosts jam sessions with musicians and friends such as [[Thundercat (musician)|Thundercat]] and [[Mac Miller]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Mac Miller x Thundercat x Mac Demarco Full Session|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOBQLDPpkq8|language=en|access-date=2021-10-21}}</ref>
