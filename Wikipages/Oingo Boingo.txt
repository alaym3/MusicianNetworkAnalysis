'''Oingo Boingo''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔɪ|ŋ|ɡ|oʊ|_|ˈ|b|ɔɪ|ŋ|ɡ|oʊ}}) was an American [[new wave music|new wave]] band formed by songwriter [[Danny Elfman]] in 1979.  The band emerged from a [[Surrealism|surrealist]] [[musical theatre]] troupe, [[The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo]], that Elfman had led and written material for in the years previous.<ref >{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/loopandreplay/mystic-knights-oingo-boingo-49f5170166a9 |title=The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo: Danny Elfman's Circus Theater Origins |last=Benson |first=Alex |date=May 15, 2018 |website=[[Medium (website)|Medium]] |access-date=October 13, 2019 }}</ref>

Oingo Boingo were known for their high energy live concerts and experimental music, which can be described as mixing [[rock music|rock]], [[ska]], [[pop music|pop]], and [[world music]].<ref name=AllMusic /> The band's body of work spanned 17 years, with various genre and line-up changes. Their best-known songs include "[[Only a Lad]]", "[[Dead Man's Party (song)|Dead Man's Party]]" and "[[Weird Science (song)|Weird Science]]".

As a rock band, Oingo Boingo started as a [[ska]] and [[Punk rock|punk]]-influenced<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/overcoming-stage-fright-danny-elfman-brings-nightmare-to-the-bowl-6188586|title=Overcoming Stage Fright, Danny Elfman Brings Nightmare to the Bowl|first=Lori|last=Denman-Underhill|date=October 22, 2015|website=laweekly.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022201537/http://www.laweekly.com/music/overcoming-stage-fright-danny-elfman-brings-nightmare-to-the-bowl-6188586|archive-date=October 22, 2015}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{cite AV media |people=Danny Elfman (interviewee) [[Jools Holland]] (interviewer) Derek Burbidge (director) |date=May 1982 |title=[[Urgh!

During the mid-1980s, the band changed line-ups and adopted a more pop-oriented style, until a significant genre change to [[alternative rock]] in 1994. At that point, the name was shortened to simply '''Boingo''' and the keyboard and horn section were dropped. The band retired after a farewell concert on Halloween 1995, for which they reverted to the name Oingo Boingo and readopted the horn section.

==History==
===The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo (1972–1979)===
{{Main|The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo}}
The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo began as a [[street theater]] troupe in Los Angeles, founded by [[Richard Elfman]]. The name was inspired by a fictional [[secret society]] on the ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'' TV series called ''[[List of fictional institutions#Chivalric, brotherly, and secret orders|The Mystic Knights of the Sea]]''. This version of the band employed as many as 15 performers at any given time, playing over 30 instruments, including some instruments built by band members.

Richard's brother Danny Elfman joined the band in 1974 and later became its leader. The group gradually moved away from its street theater origins and transformed into a dedicated musical theater act. The group performed an eclectic repertoire ranging from [[Cab Calloway]] covers to instrumentals in the style of [[Bali]]nese [[gamelan]] and Russian [[ballet music]], and later original songs by Danny Elfman. Guitarist Steve Bartek joined in 1976 as musical co-director.

===I.R.S. and A&M years (1979–1984)===
[[File:Danny Elfman (Oingo Boingo) Hagström Kent II guitar, HRC Montréal.jpg|thumb|Guitar used by Danny Elfman in Oingo Boingo, [[Hard Rock Cafe]] Montreal]]
In 1979, Danny Elfman reformed the group as a dedicated rock band, under the new name ''Oingo Boingo'', at which point most existing members left. Steve Bartek and a brass trio of Dale Turner, Sam "Sluggo" Phipps and Leon Schneiderman continued with the new band. Various reasons were given for the restart as a rock band, notably Danny's emerging musical interests and reducing the need for transportation and set-up of multiple stage sets and props. Elfman stated the shift was inspired by [[ska revival]] bands such as [[the Specials]], [[Madness (band)|Madness]], and [[the Selecter]], new wave bands like [[XTC]], [[Devo]], and [[Fun Boy Three]], as well as the "energy and speed" of [[Punk rock|punk]].<ref name="Halfyard2004">{{cite book|last1=Halfyard|first1=Janet|title=Danny Elfman's Batman: A Film Score Guide|year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OGOYqpxsyRgC&pg=PA6|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-5126-9|page=6}}</ref><ref name=MixOnline>{{cite web |url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_danny_elfman/ |title=An interview where Danny Elfman mentions the new wave and Ska influences in Oingo Boingo |publisher=Mixonline.com |date=May 1, 2001 |access-date=November 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229042619/http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_danny_elfman/ |archive-date=February 29, 2012}}</ref><ref name="auto"/><ref>{{cite tweet|user=dannyelfman|author=Danny Elfman|author-link=Danny Elfman|number=1146254698976075781|date=2 July 2019|title=Andy Partridge was a huge influence. It was that first year of getting back to the radio after a decade long moratorium, and the music of XTC, The Specials, Selector, Madness, Fun Boy Three, and Devo that turned me around.}}</ref>

For some early gigs during the reformation, the band used the shortened name '''The Mystic Knights''' (and in the animated short "Face Like a Frog" by [[Sally Cruikshank]], the song "Don't Go in the Basement" is credited to that name). The name '''Oingo Boingo''' was settled on in 1979, at which point their early song "I'm Afraid" appeared on the [[Rhino Records]] Los Angeles rock and new wave "up and coming" compilation, ''L.A. In''.

That same year, the band self-funded a promo EP record, known as the "Demo EP", for distribution to radio stations and recording industry A&R representatives to help land a contract. The effort paid off, as the record caught the attention of I.R.S. Records, who released a revised version of the EP in 1980; the ''[[Oingo Boingo (EP)|Oingo Boingo]]'' EP.

The band had now coalesced as an octet: Danny Elfman on lead vocals and rhythm guitar; [[Steve Bartek]] on lead guitar; [[Richard Gibbs]] on keyboards; Kerry Hatch on bass; Johnny "Vatos" Hernandez on drums; and Leon Schneiderman, [[Sam Phipps|Sam "Sluggo" Phipps]] and [[Dale Turner (trumpeter)|Dale Turner]] on horns. Early success for the group came in 1980 with the song "Only a Lad" from the [[Oingo Boingo (EP)|eponymous EP]]. The song aired frequently in Los Angeles on [[KROQ-FM]] and complemented the station's then-unusual new wave format.

Following regional success of "Only a Lad", the group released its first full-length album in 1981, also titled ''[[Only a Lad]]'' (and featuring a new recording of the song). The band released further albums ''[[Nothing to Fear (Oingo Boingo album)|Nothing to Fear]]'' in 1982 and ''[[Good for Your Soul]]'' in 1983. Although the band's sound was termed as new wave, Oingo Boingo's use of exotic percussion, a three-piece horn section, unconventional scales and harmony, and surreal imagery was a genre-skewing combination.

In 1984, bassist Kerry Hatch and keyboardist Richard Gibbs departed to form the short-lived band ''Zuma II'' and Oingo Boingo went on temporary hiatus, although this was not known publicly at the time. Elfman later claimed the two departing members had "lost the spirit", but stated, "I could never blame anybody for losing the spirit. It's very hard being an 8-piece ensemble doing what, at the time, was non-commercial music".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Darling |first=Cary |date=May 5, 1987 |title=Oingo Boingo's Difficult Teenage Years |magazine=BAM Magazine }}</ref>

===MCA years (1984–1992)===
[[File:boingo.png|thumb|upright|Oingo Boingo logo, adopted around the late 1980s]]
Elfman used the 1984 hiatus as an opportunity to release a solo album, co-produced with Steve Bartek, with the remaining members of Oingo Boingo returning as session musicians. This was released as ''[[So-Lo]]'' in late 1984. At this point, new manager [[Mike Gormley]], who had just left the position of VP of Publicity and Asst. to the Chairman of A&M, negotiated a release from the label and signed the band to [[MCA Records]].

Shortly after releasing ''So-Lo'', Oingo Boingo returned to performing with new bassist John Avila and keyboardist Mike Bacich. The first release with the new line-up was ''[[Dead Man's Party (album)|Dead Man's Party]]'' in 1985. The album marked a notable change towards more pop oriented songwriting and production style and became the band's most commercially successful record. It featured their highest-charting song on the Billboard Hot 100, "[[Weird Science (song)|Weird Science]]", which was written for the [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] [[Weird Science (film)|film of the same name]]. 

The band appeared on a number of movie soundtracks in the early to mid-1980s, including an appearance in the movie ''[[Back to School]]'' in 1986, performing their hit single "Dead Man's Party". The soundtrack to the movie ''[[Bachelor Party (1984 film)|Bachelor Party]]'' included a theme song written by Elfman and a song unreleased on any Oingo Boingo album, "Something Isn't Right".

During this era, Danny Elfman also began scoring major films, beginning with 1985's ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]''. Elfman would go on to write the scores to almost all of [[Tim Burton]]'s films. Oingo Boingo guitarist Steve Bartek has [[Orchestrator#Dedicated orchestrators|orchestrated]] most of Elfman's film and television scores.

The album ''[[BOI-NGO]]'' was released in 1987. Following its recording, Bacich was replaced by new keyboardist Carl Graves. The band's 1988 release, ''[[Boingo Alive]]'', comprised "live" re-recordings of previous album songs on a studio soundstage, plus a new song, "Winning Side". This new track was also released as a single and became a No. 14 hit on US Modern Rock radio stations.

In 1990, the band released their seventh studio album, ''[[Dark at the End of the Tunnel]]'', featuring more mellow songs than any previous release and including the singles "Out of Control" and "Flesh 'N Blood".

===Final years (1993–1995)===
Oingo Boingo continued to regularly perform live, most notably with annual Halloween concerts at Irvine Meadows and the Universal Amphitheatre. Following a short hiatus in 1992, during which time Elfman was busy scoring films, the band returned in 1993 with an increasingly different, hard-rock musical direction and debuted new material, such as "Insanity", "Helpless" and the unreleased song "Did It There". Shows during these years often included the so-called "Sad Clown Orchestra" providing additional accordion and circus percussion.

That same year, Oingo Boingo began recording an eighth studio album for new label [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]]. The sessions stalled when Elfman became heavily involved writing the music for animated musical ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' with Tim Burton.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/zombdog/6409356299/|title=The Elfman Cometh|last=Poggi|first=Alison|date=July 1994|work=SLAMM, San Diego's Lifestyle and Music Magazine via Flickr|access-date=July 5, 2017|language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluntinstrument.org.uk/elfman/archive/SFChronicle94.htm |title=San Francisco Chronicle article |access-date=March 24, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403045244/http://www.bluntinstrument.org.uk/elfman/archive/SFChronicle94.htm |archive-date=April 3, 2016 }}</ref> Of this period, Elfman would later reflect that, after over 15 years, he had begun losing his passion for the band.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://music.avclub.com/danny-elfman-on-oingo-boingo-film-scores-and-the-beat-1798274010 |title=Danny Elfman on Oingo Boingo, film scores, and the Beatles almost ruining Batman |publisher=AV Music |date=October 27, 2014 |access-date=May 13, 2019 }}</ref>

In 1994, the band consolidated their new musical style and shortened its name to "Boingo". Guitarist [[Warren Fitzgerald]] joined while keyboardist Carl Graves and the horn trio were removed. This marked the only year that the band toured without the horn section.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1994-05-15/entertainment/ca-57894_1_rock-band/4 |title=Los Angeles Times interview with Danny Elfman |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=October 22, 1985 |access-date=November 2, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110805113343/http://articles.latimes.com/1994-05-15/entertainment/ca-57894_1_rock-band/4 |archive-date=August 5, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boingo.org/articles/SFChronicle1994.html |title=San Francisco Chronicle Q and A with Danny Elfman | website=Boingo.org |date=June 12, 1994 |access-date= November 2, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111004154524/http://www.boingo.org/articles/SFChronicle1994.html |archive-date=October 4, 2011}}</ref>

The previously-shelved album was completed with the new 5-piece line-up, including orchestral instrumentation and several songs improvised in the studio for the first time in the band's history.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/zombdog/6409356299/|title=The Elfman Cometh| last= Poggi| first= Alison|date=July 1994|work=SLAMM, San Diego's Lifestyle and Music Magazine via Flickr|access-date= July 5, 2017|language=en-us}}</ref> This was released as ''[[Boingo (album)|Boingo]]'' in 1994, and would be the band's final studio album.

In 1995, it was announced that Boingo would be disbanding after 17 years. The band embarked on a "Farewell" tour in 1995, restoring the original horn trio and reverting its name back to Oingo Boingo, ending with a final Halloween performance at the [[Universal Amphitheatre]]. The concert was filmed and released as a [[Farewell (Oingo Boingo album)|live album and DVD]].

===Legacy===
Following the band's dissolution, Danny Elfman continued composing for film and has been nominated for four [[Academy Award]]s for his work. While he has provided the scores for Tim Burton's films almost exclusively since ''Pee-wee's Big Adventure'' in 1985, Elfman continues to be much sought-after by other directors in the movie business as well. Elfman's other scores have included those for ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'', ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'', ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]'', ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'', ''[[Big Fish]]'', and ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''. Elfman has also written themes for more than a dozen TV series, including ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', and ''[[Desperate Housewives]]''. Elfman almost exclusively employs former Oingo Boingo guitarist Steve Bartek as his orchestrator.

In the 1990s, John Avila and Johnny "Vatos" Hernandez, along with guitarist Michael Tovar, formed the trio Food for Feet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/food-for-feet-mw0000654309|title=Food for Feet - Food for Feet &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=October 20, 2021}}</ref> Avila and Hernandez also formed the rhythm section of [[Tito & Tarantula]], a Los Angeles band fronted by [[Tito Larriva]] of [[the Plugz]] and the [[Cruzados]]. Avila and Hernandez also joined Larriva and guitarist Stevie Hufstetter in a one-off project band called [[Tito Larriva#Psychotic Aztecs|Psychotic Aztecs]]. The Aztecs released one album on the Grita label called ''Santa Sangre''. Doug Lacy (Boingo live keyboardist and percussionist) recruited bassist John Avila, guitarist Steve Bartek, drummer Johnny "Vatos" Hernandez, and saxophonist Sam Phipps (among other musicians) for a band called Doug & The Mystics. They recorded one album, ''New Hat'', which included a cover of the Oingo Boingo song "Try to Believe", as well as original songs and covers of songs by Frank Zappa and other artists. Doug had released one solo album previously.

In 2003, former keyboardist Richard Gibbs scored the [[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|''Battlestar Galactica'' miniseries]] with composer [[Bear McCreary]]. In 2005, John Avila, Johnny "Vatos" Hernandez and Steve Bartek began contributing to the subsequent McCreary-scored ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' television series. 

Since the 2005 Halloween season, former drummer Johnny "Vatos" Hernandez has regularly put together an Oingo Boingo tribute band for performances at different venues, mainly throughout Southern California and Arizona, including [[the Grove of Anaheim]]. Initially billed as the "Johnny 'Vatos' Tribute to Halloween, Featuring Former Members of Oingo Boingo",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bearmccreary.com/|title=Bear McCreary |website=Bearmccreary.com|access-date=October 20, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goldstar.com/events/anaheim-ca/johnny-vatos-tribute-to-halloween-featuring-former-members-of-oingo-boingo|title=Johnny Vatos' 'Tribute To Halloween', Featuring Former Members of Oingo Boingo|website=Goldstar.com|access-date=January 22, 2020}}</ref> Hernandez eventually titled the project Johnny Vatos Oingo Boingo Dance Party and then Oingo Boingo Former Members.

In early 2007, Danny Elfman had said there would not be an Oingo Boingo reunion, due to fears that playing live would exacerbate his, and possibly other band members', hearing loss. Not withstanding this announcement, on Halloween 2015, Danny Elfman, along with two of the other original voices from the movie ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'', [[Catherine O'Hara]] and [[Ken Page]], performed at the [[Hollywood Bowl]], singing all of the songs from the movie with a complete orchestra, while the film played in its entirety. [[Paul Reubens]] made a special guest appearance in an encore performance of "Kidnap the Sandy Claws", reprising his original role of Lock from the film, and the event culminated in Elfman and Oingo Boingo guitarist Steve Bartek performing "Dead Man's Party" for the first time in twenty years.

Oingo Boingo were honored with a resolution at [[Los Angeles City Hall]] in April 2016. Popular L.A. radio and television personality [[Richard Blade]] gave a speech about the band's legacy. Several members attended the meeting from across the band's changing line-ups, including Johnny "Vatos" Hernandez, founding keyboardist Richard Gibbs, John Avila, Carl Graves and Sam "Sluggo" Phipps.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2016/04/20/la-city-council-to-honor-80s-band-oingo-boingo/ |title=80s Band Oingo Boingo Performs Acoustic Set At LA City Council Meeting |publisher=CBS Los Angeles |date=April 20, 2016 |access-date=August 9, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031143500/http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2016/04/20/la-city-council-to-honor-80s-band-oingo-boingo/ |archive-date=October 31, 2016}}</ref>
