'''Gerald Sheldon Herman''' (July 10, 1931 – December 26, 2019) was an American [[composer]] and [[lyricist]], known for his work in [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theater]].

One of the most commercially successful Broadway songwriters of his time, Herman was the composer and lyricist for a number of hit musicals, starting in the 1960s, that were characterized by an upbeat and optimistic outlook and what Herman called "the simple, hummable showtune". His shows include ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' (1964), at one time the longest-running musical in Broadway history, which also produced [[Hello, Dolly! (song)|the hit title song for Louis Armstrong]]; ''[[Mame (musical)|Mame]]'' (1966), a vehicle for [[Angela Lansbury]]; and ''[[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|La Cage aux Folles]]'' (1984), the first hit Broadway musical about a gay couple. 

In 2009, Herman received the [[Special Tony Award|Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Theatre]].  He was a recipient of the 2010 [[Kennedy Center Honors]].

Herman told ''People Magazine'' in 1986 that his mother, who died in 1954, long before his success on Broadway, "was glamorous like Mame and witty like Dolly."<ref name=":2" />

After marrying, his parents lived in Jersey City and continued to work in the summers in various camps until they became head counselors and finally ran Stissing Lake Camp in the small town of [[Pine Plains (town), New York|Pine Plains]], New York, in the [[Taconic Mountains]].

==Early career==
After graduation from the University of Miami, Herman moved to [[New York City]], where he produced the [[Off-Broadway]] [[revue]] ''I Feel Wonderful'', which was made up of material he had written at the University. It opened at the [[Theatre de Lys]] in [[Greenwich Village]] on October 18, 1954, and ran for 48 performances.<ref>Citron, Stephen, p. 33</ref> It was his only show his mother saw; she died of cancer at the age of forty-four in December 1954.<ref>[https://masterworksbroadway.com/artist/jerry-herman/ "Jerry Herman Biography"] masterworksbroadway.com, accessed September 1, 2019</ref> Herman said "I went into serious grieving."<ref>Citron, Stephen, p. 35</ref>

In 1957, Herman approached the owner of a West Fourth Street jazz club called the Showplace and asked to put on a revue. As well as supplying the music, Herman wrote the book and directed the one-hour revue, called ''Nightcap''. He asked his friend, [[Phyllis Newman]], to do movement and dance and it featured [[Charles Nelson Reilly]] (who later co-starred in ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]''). The show opened in May 1958 and ran for two years.<ref>Citron, Stephen. pp.39-40</ref>

Herman next collected enough original material to put together an [[Off-Broadway]] revue called [[Parade (revue)|''Parade'']] in 1960. Herman directed with choreography by Richard Tone. The cast included [[Charles Nelson Reilly]] and [[Dody Goodman]]. It first opened at the Showplace and, expanded, moved to the Players Theatre in January 1960.<ref>[http://www.jerryherman.com/parade.htm jerryherman.com], Parade information</ref><ref>Suskin, Steven.[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/66908.html/pg2 "Oh!

==Broadway career==
In 1960, Herman made his Broadway debut with the revue ''[[From A to Z]]'', which featured contributions from newcomers [[Woody Allen]] and [[Fred Ebb]] as well.<ref>[http://www.playbill.com/production/from-a-to-z-plymouth-theatre-vault-0000009611 " ''From A to Z'' Broadway"] ''Playbill'' (vault), retrieved June 26, 2018</ref> That same year producer Gerard Oestreicher approached him after seeing a performance of [[Parade (revue)|"Parade"]], and asked if he would be interested in composing the score for a show about the founding of the state of [[Israel]]. The result was his first full-fledged Broadway musical, ''[[Milk and Honey (musical)|Milk and Honey]] ''in 1961. The show, about American tourists in Israel, starred [[Robert Weede]], [[Mimi Benzell]] and [[Molly Picon]]. It received respectable reviews, was nominated for a Tony award, and ran for 543 performances.<ref name=":2" /><ref>[http://www.playbill.com/production/milk-and-honey-martin-beck-theatre-vault-0000008253 " ''Milk and Honey'' Broadway"] ''Playbill'' (vault), retrieved June 26, 2018</ref>

Herman met playwright [[Tad Mosel]] in 1960 and they collaborated on an Off-Broadway musical adaptation of Mosel's 1953 television play, ''Madame Aphrodite''. The [[Madame Aphrodite (musical)|musical of the same name]], which starred [[Nancy Andrews (actress)|Nancy Andrews]] in the title role, opened at the [[Orpheum Theatre (Manhattan)|Orpheum Theatre]] in December 1961 but closed after 13 performances.<ref name="Citron2008">{{cite book|author=Stephen Citron|title=Jerry Herman: Poet of the Showtune|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fFz5QgJsjL4C&pg=PA69|date=October 1, 2008|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-13324-0|pages=69–}}</ref> The show has never been performed since. The failure of the musical hurt Herman, who felt that the direction and casting had not worked, but described his decision to make it as a "very brave thing for me to do...It was a dark piece, something more suited to early Sondheim than me".<ref name="Citron2008"/>

In 1966, Herman's next musical was the hit ''[[Mame (musical)|Mame]]'' starring [[Angela Lansbury]], which introduced a string of Herman standards, most notably the ballad "If He Walked Into My Life", the holiday favorite "We Need a Little Christmas", and the title tune.<ref>[http://www.musicals101.com/1960bway2.htm#Mame ''Mame''] musicals101.com, retrieved June 26, 2018</ref><ref>[http://www.tamswitmark.com/shows/mame/ ''Mame''] tamswitmark.com, retrieved June 26, 2018</ref>

==Impact and recognition==
According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Herman's 1983 ''La Cage aux Folles'', which centered on a gay couple whose son is about to marry the daughter of a conservative family, "arrived during the height of the AIDS epidemic and helped put gay life into the cultural mainstream at a time when many gay men were being stigmatized."<ref name=":2" />

Herman is the only composer/lyricist to have had three original productions open on Broadway at the same time, from February to May 1969: ''[[Hello, Dolly!

==Personal life and death==
Having a flair for decorating in the 1970s, Herman took a break from composition after the failure of ''Mack and Mabel''. ''[[Architectural Digest]]'' wrote about the firehouse he renovated: he then redecorated other houses and sold them.

   |quote=The financial success of Dolly allowed Herman to buy an old firehouse and renovate it. The magazine [[House Beautiful]] ran an article on it, and Herman's second career was born. During the 1970s, he turned to decorating houses and reselling them. Herman could have lived well just off the profits of his hits, but he found decorating to be therapeutic.
