'''Dead Man's Bones''' is a rock duo consisting of actor [[Ryan Gosling]] and Zach Shields. Their first album, ''Dead Man's Bones'', was released on 6 October 2009 through [[ANTI-|ANTI- Records]]. The entire album is a collaboration with the [[Silverlake Conservatory of Music|Silverlake Conservatory Children's Choir]] — started by [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] bassist [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] — from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].<ref name=rollingstone>{{cite news|last=Carpenter|first=Ellen|title=Breaking: Dead Man's Bones|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/breaking-dead-mans-bones-20091014|accessdate=10 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Rolling Stone]]|date=14 October 2009}}</ref> Gosling performs under the alias "Baby Goose".

==Background and development==
When Shields and Gosling met in 2005 they discovered a mutual obsession with the [[Haunted Mansion]] ride at [[Disneyland]]. Zach was so preoccupied with ghosts as a kid that he was put into therapy, and Gosling's parents moved out of his childhood home because they believed it was haunted. Neither of them had really outgrown their fascination with graveyards or anything deathly and decided to write love stories about [[ghosts]] and [[monsters]]. 

The pair chose to play all the instruments on the record, even those they had never touched before. They also imposed rules on themselves during the recording process, such as not playing with a [[click track]], and trying to do no more than three takes on any song, letting any imperfections highlight the strengths of the music.<ref name=anti-press>{{cite web|title=Dead Man's Bones Sign To ANTI|url=http://www.anti.com/press/dead-mans-bones-sign-to-anti/|publisher=[[ANTI-]]|accessdate=10 April 2014|date=3 December 2009}}</ref> On 25 December 2008, Dead Man's Bones released a music video and free download for their song "In the Room Where You Sleep",<ref name=theinsider>{{cite web|last=taylorblue|title=Ryan Gosling Debuts His First Music Video|url=http://www.theinsider.com/news/1469771_Ryan_Gosling_Debuts_His_First_Music_Video|work=The Insider|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc.|accessdate=11 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091127131432/http://www.theinsider.com/news/1469771_Ryan_Gosling_Debuts_His_First_Music_Video|archivedate=27 November 2009|date=26 December 2008}}</ref> and on 4 April 2009, the band released another music video for their song "Name in Stone" on [[MySpace]] and [[YouTube]].
