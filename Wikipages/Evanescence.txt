'''Evanescence''' is an American [[rock music|rock]]<!--Discuss before changing--> band founded in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], in 1995 by singer, pianist, and keyboardist [[Amy Lee]] and guitarist [[Ben Moody]].<ref name="OotS-Evfounding" /><ref name="Berelian2005" /> After recording independent albums, the band released their first full-length album, ''[[Fallen (Evanescence album)|Fallen]]'', on [[Wind-up Records]] in 2003. On the strength of hit singles "[[Bring Me to Life]]" and "[[My Immortal]]", ''Fallen'' sold more than 17 million copies worldwide and helped the band win two [[Grammy Award]]s out of six nominations. A year later, Evanescence released their first live album, ''[[Anywhere but Home]]'', which sold more than one million copies worldwide. In 2006, the band released their second studio album, ''[[The Open Door]]'', which sold more than five million copies.<ref name="evnews20110518" />

The band reconvened in June 2009 with a new lineup; their next studio album, ''[[Evanescence (Evanescence album)|Evanescence]]'', was released in 2011. It debuted at the top of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart with 127,000 copies in sales.<ref name="www.billboard.com" /> The album also debuted at number one on four other different [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]]; the Rock Albums, Digital Albums, Alternative Albums, and the Hard Rock Albums charts. The band spent 2012 on tour in promotion of their latest album with other bands including [[The Pretty Reckless]] and [[Fair to Midland]]. [[Troy McLawhorn]] also became a full-time band member during this time. Following the end of the album's tour cycle in 2012, the band entered another hiatus.

In 2015, Evanescence emerged from hiatus and announced they would resume touring; however, they stated that new Evanescence material was not being produced, as Lee was focusing on a solo project instead. In addition, Balsamo left the band and was replaced by [[Jen Majura]]. In March 2017, Lee stated Evanescence was working on a fourth album for release later in 2017; ''[[Synthesis (Evanescence album)|Synthesis]]'' was released worldwide on November 10, 2017, and marked a stylistic change in the band's sound. On March 26, 2021, the band released their fifth studio album, ''[[The Bitter Truth]]''.

The lineup of the group changed several times over the course of the first two studio albums{{'}} productions and promotions: [[David Hodges]] left in 2002, co-founder Moody left in 2003 (mid-tour), followed by guitarist [[John LeCompt]] and drummer [[Rocky Gray]] in 2007, and [[Terry Balsamo]] in 2015. As a result, none of the band's five studio albums feature the same lineup. The latter two changes led to a hiatus, with temporary band members contributing to tour performances.

==History==

===1995–2001: Formation and early years===
Evanescence was founded by singer, pianist and songwriter Amy Lee and former lead guitarist and songwriter Ben Moody. The two met in 1994 at a Christian youth camp in Little Rock, where Moody heard Lee play [[Meat Loaf]]'s "[[I'd Do Anything for Love]]" on the piano.<ref name="MTVsplit" /><ref name="sac20111011">{{cite news |url=https://www.sacurrent.com/sanantonio/evanescence-comes-back-strong-while-keeping-jesus-mostly-out-of-it/Content?oid=2242627 |title=Evanescence comes back strong while keeping Jesus (mostly) out of it |work=San Antonio Current |first=Enrique |last=Lopetegui |date=October 11, 2011 |access-date=October 10, 2018}}</ref> The band became popular after performing in coffee shops around the Little Rock area.<ref name="fact-or-fiction">{{cite web |url=http://loudwire.com/evanescence-amy-lee-wikipedia-fact-or-fiction/ |title=Evanescence's Amy Lee Plays 'Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?' |work=[[Loudwire]] |last=Hartmann |first=Graham |date=October 26, 2016 |access-date=March 3, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322081835/http://loudwire.com/evanescence-amy-lee-wikipedia-fact-or-fiction/ |archive-date=March 22, 2017}}</ref> After experimenting with band names, such as Childish Intentions and Stricken, they decided on Evanescence, which means "disappearance" or "fading away" (from the word ''[[wikt:evanesce|evanesce]]'', which means "to disappear").<ref name="fact-or-fiction" /><ref name="EOA1" />

The band released three EPs. The first is the self-titled ''Evanescence'' EP (1998), of which about 100 copies were made and distributed at the band's early live performances. The second is the ''Sound Asleep'' EP, also known as the ''Whisper'' EP (1999). There was also a third EP called ''Mystary'' EP (2003). For their first full-length demo CD, ''[[Origin (Evanescence album)|Origin]]'' (2000), about 2,500 copies were produced and sold to concert audiences. ''Origin'' and the EPs contain demo versions of some songs on their debut album, ''Fallen''. During a radio interview, Lee and Moody encouraged fans to download the band's older songs from the Internet, rather than purchase them from online sources such as [[eBay]] where the material had been selling for over US$250.<ref name="EvRef-music" /><ref name="EvRef-mp3" />

===2002–2005: ''Fallen'' and ''Anywhere but Home''===
{{Main|Fallen (Evanescence album)|l1=Fallen}}
[[File:Evanescence (logo).svg|thumb|The band's signature font was created when ''[[Fallen (Evanescence album)|Fallen]]'' was in development. The label designers used slightly modified versions of each character to make the track titles look unique.<ref name="Draftlight" />]]
Having first encountered the band at [[Ardent Studios]] in Memphis and been suitably impressed, producer Pete Matthews played their demos to his friend at [[Wind-up Records]], [[Diana Meltzer]].<ref name="hitquarters.com" /> It was when Meltzer heard "[[My Immortal]]" that she became interested in signing the band, saying she "knew it was a hit". The Wind-up A&R told [[HitQuarters]] that, although they already exhibited huge talent, they were still young and needed to be developed, and "given the time and opportunity they could deliver a breakthrough sound."<ref name="hitquarters.com" /> Once signed the band were relocated to Los Angeles, given an apartment and rehearsal space and enrolled in a gym. Lee was given acting and vocal classes. After almost two years producer [[Dave Fortman]] was brought in to produce their first album ''[[Fallen (Evanescence album)|Fallen]]''.<ref name="hitquarters.com" /> Record label executives initially refused to release the album unless the band would agree to add a full-time male co-vocalist. When the band would not agree to this demand, the label relented and insisted only on having a male vocalist in the album's lead single, "Bring Me to Life". Lee was still not happy about this, but eventually she agreed to the decision.<ref name="Scuzz">{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbcgsjmNzO4&t=931 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319144353/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbcgsjmNzO4&gl=US&hl=en| archive-date=2013-03-19|title=Scuzz Meets Evanescence |work=[[Scuzz|Scuzz TV]] |via=YouTube |author1=Beez |first2=Amy |last2=Lee |name-list-style=amp|date=March 13, 2013 |access-date=December 29, 2013}}</ref>

In early 2003, the lineup was completed by Amy Lee and Ben Moody's friends, [[John LeCompt]], [[Rocky Gray]] and Will Boyd, all of whom worked on Evanescence's earlier songs. While they were looking to promote ''Fallen'', Evanescence accepted an offer from the video game company [[Nintendo]] to perform on the Nintendo Fusion Tour, which they headlined in 2003.<ref name="FusionTour1" />
<!--this section needs some development information, as well.-->

''Fallen'' spent 43 weeks in the top 10 of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], peaking at number three;<ref name="TODpr1" /> was certified 7× Platinum in the United States;<ref name="Fallen7xplat" /> and sold more than 17 million copies worldwide.<ref name="cbs821" /> The album was listed for 104 weeks on the ''Billboard'' 200,<ref name="billboard1" /> and it was one of eight albums in the history of the chart to spend at least a year in the top 50.<ref name="IGN" /> In addition, ''Fallen'' was number 6 on [[CBS]]'s list of "Top Bestselling Albums of the Last 10 Years".<ref name="cbs821" /> Evanescence's [[record label|major label]] debut single "[[Bring Me to Life]]", featuring guest vocals from Paul McCoy of [[12 Stones]], was a global hit for the band and reached number five on the American [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="bbchart" /> It provided Evanescence with a UK number-one single, where it stayed for four weeks from June–July 2003.<ref name="ukcharts" /> The song also became the official theme for [[No Way Out (2003)|WWE No Way Out 2003]]. "My Immortal" received similar success, peaking at number seven on the US and UK charts,<ref name="bbchart" /> and both songs were featured on the soundtrack for the action movie ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]''. "Bring Me to Life" was recognized at the [[46th Grammy Awards]] in 2004, where the band won the awards for [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] and were nominated for three others.<ref name="46grammy" /> The two other singles from ''Fallen'' are "[[Going Under (Evanescence song)|Going Under]]" (No. 5 U.S. Modern Rock Tracks,<ref name="bbchart" /> No.&nbsp;8 UK Charts) and "[[Everybody's Fool]]" (No. 36 U.S. Modern Rock Tracks,<ref name="bbchart" /> No.&nbsp;23 UK Charts); each was promoted by a music video.

On October 22, 2003, Moody left the band during the European tour for ''Fallen'', reportedly because of creative differences.<ref name="allmusic1" /> In an interview several months later, Amy Lee said: "...we'd gotten to a point that if something didn't change, we wouldn't have been able to make a second record." This became a point of confusion, as Moody and Lee stated on the ''Fallen'' album liner notes that they were best friends.<ref name="smh" /> Lee said it was almost a relief that Moody left because of tensions created within the band.<ref name="smh" /> During an interview, Lee has said, "I don't know, I just think it's exactly what I would've expected. He's more about kind of the pop influence sort of thing and also, you know, about being commercial and I mean selling albums: That's the part of him we often disagreed on. I wanted to do the more artistic weird thing and he'd wanna do the thing that people would want to hear..." She adds "So that's a lot of the reason [why] it's been so fun writing now, is [that] we're not thinking about that. It's like 'what do we like?', 'what's fun?', like 'what do we want to do that's different?'"<ref name="youtubequote" /> Moody was replaced by [[Terry Balsamo]] from [[Cold (band)|Cold]].<ref name="VH1newguitarist" />

[[File:Evanescence lezenith.jpg|thumb|Evanescence performing at the concert in [[Le Zénith]], Paris, featured on ''Anywhere but Home'']]

In 2004, Evanescence's new lineup released a DVD/CD compilation titled ''[[Anywhere but Home]]''. The DVD includes a concert in Paris, as well as behind-the-scenes features, including shots of the band backstage signing autographs and warming up. Also on the CD are the live songs "Breathe No More" (from the ''[[Elektra (2005 film)|Elektra]]'' movie soundtrack), "Farther Away", and the band's [[Cover version|cover]] of [[Korn]]'s "[[Thoughtless (Korn song)|Thoughtless]]". The album has sold more than a million copies worldwide.<ref name="evbio" />

===2006–2009: ''The Open Door''===
{{Main|The Open Door}}
A spokesperson for the band's label confirmed on July 14, 2006, that bassist Will Boyd had left the band for "not wanting to do another big tour" and wanting "to be close to his family." Amy Lee originally broke the news to the fans in a post on an unofficial Evanescence site, EvBoard.com.<ref name="VH1losebass" /> In an interview with MTV, posted on their website on August 10, 2006, Lee announced that [[Tim McCord]], former [[The Revolution Smile|Revolution Smile]] guitarist, would switch instruments and play bass for the band.<ref name="VH1inspiration" />

[[File:Amy Lee - Evanescence 07.jpg|thumb|left|Amy Lee in 2007]]

The album progressed slowly for several reasons, including Amy Lee's desire to maximize the creative process and not rush production, other band members' side projects, Balsamo's stroke, and turbulence within their management.<ref name="evbio" /> Although Lee stated on the fan [[internet forum|forum]] Evboard that Evanescence's new album would be completed in March 2006,<ref name="Evboardlovealbum" /> the release was pushed back allegedly because "Wind-up...wanted to make a few changes to the upcoming single '[[Call Me When You're Sober]]'", which hit modern rock and alternative rock radio on August 7, 2006. The 13-track album ''[[The Open Door]]'' was released in Canada and the United States on October 3, 2006;<ref name="TODpr1" /> the United Kingdom on October 2, 2006; and Australia on September 30, 2006.<ref name="TODAUrelease" /> The album sold 447,000 copies in the United States in its first week of sales and earned their first No.&nbsp;1 ranking on the ''Billboard'' 200 album chart.<ref name="billboard1" /><ref name="jb-sober" /> The music video for "Call Me When You're Sober" was shot in Los Angeles and is based on the [[fairy tale]] ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]''. ''The Open Door'' became available for pre-order on the [[iTunes Store]] on August 15, 2006; the music video for "Call Me When You're Sober" was also made available.<ref name="offnews1">{{cite web |url=http://www.evanescence.com/news.asp |title=On Tuesday Aug 15th... |website=Evanescence.com |access-date=August 9, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107112212/http://javieraroche.com/2006/10/02/the-open-door-available-tomorrow-conan-obrien-tonight/ |archive-date=January 7, 2012}}</ref>

The tour for ''The Open Door'' began on October 5, 2006, in [[Toronto]] and included locations in Canada, the U.S. and Europe during that year. This first tour continued on January 5, 2007, and included stops in Canada (alongside band [[Stone Sour]]), Japan and Australia (alongside band [[Shihad]]) and then returned to the U.S. for a second tour in the spring (alongside bands [[Chevelle (band)|Chevelle]] and [[Finger Eleven]]).<ref name="ev-tourtod2" /><ref name="evtod-tourtod2" /> As part of their tour, Evanescence performed on April 15, 2007, on the Argentinian festival Quilmes Rock 07 along with [[Aerosmith]], [[Velvet Revolver]] and other local bands.<ref name="quilmes" /> They also co-headlined on the [[Family Values Tour 2007]] along with Korn and other bands.<ref name="FamVal07" /><ref name="evnews0521" /> The group closed their European tour with a sell-out concert at the Amphi in [[Ra'anana]], Israel, on June 26, 2007,<ref name="Ynet07" /> and finished the album tour on December 9, 2007.<ref name="evthreads531972" />

On May 4, 2007, John LeCompt announced that he had been fired from Evanescence, and also stated that drummer Rocky Gray had decided to quit.<ref name="ladaily0737" /> They both would join Moody to eventually form the band [[We Are the Fallen]]. Wind-up issued a [[press release]] on May 17, 2007, stating that two [[Dark New Day]] members, drummer [[Will Hunt]] and guitarist [[Troy McLawhorn]], would be joining the band to replace LeCompt and Gray.<ref name="bm72791" /> It was initially stated that Hunt and McLawhorn would tour with Evanescence until the end of the Family Values Tour in September 2007,<ref name="blabbermouth268958" /> but both continued to play with the band through ''The Open Door'' tour.<ref name="evthreads531972" />

In a Facebook post, Lee revealed that the new album is titled ''[[Synthesis (Evanescence album)|Synthesis]]''. According to Lee, the album is an orchestral piece that contains instruments such as brass and other orchestral elements. She also revealed that David Campbell, who worked on all of the band's previous albums, would return to compose for the new project. Lee said that the album is about "orchestra and electronica", and that the band is taking selected songs from their previous albums and stripping out the rock guitars and drums, rebuilding them into a classical arrangement reminiscent of a soundtrack. The album contained two new original songs, one titled "Hi-Lo" starring [[Lindsey Stirling]]. The first recording session for ''Synthesis'' took place on May 23, 2017, and a remake of "Bring Me To Life" was released as a single on August 18.<ref>{{cite web |title=Evanescence - Bring Me To Life (Synthesis) |url=https://open.spotify.com/track/7h7BiKY7rhS6X8TDPUWGCg?si=PAfckCU8 |website=YouTube |date = August 18, 2017|publisher=Evanescence |access-date=August 18, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818174013/https://open.spotify.com/track/7h7BiKY7rhS6X8TDPUWGCg?si=PAfckCU8 |archive-date=August 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/Evanescence/posts/10154361100346786:0 |title=First day recording the orchestra... |work=Facebook.com |date=May 23, 2017 |access-date=May 23, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614134307/https://www.facebook.com/Evanescence/posts/10154361100346786%3A0 |archive-date=June 14, 2017}}</ref> On August 15, the band announced that recording ''Synthesis'' was in its final stages.

Lee claimed that she wrote a song for the 2005 film ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', but that it was rejected because of its dark sound. Lee went on to state that it was just "more great stuff [for ''The Open Door'']".<ref name="Evboardbunchostuff" /> Another song supposedly written for ''Narnia'' was the [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]-inspired "[[Lacrymosa (song)|Lacrymosa]]".<ref name="MetalEdge" /> The producers of ''Narnia'', however, rebutted her claim, stating this information was "news to them" and that no Evanescence music had been planned for inclusion in the soundtrack.<ref name="nzh569" />

In 2010, Evanescence released "Together Again" as a digital download, a song created for ''The Open Door'' but later cut. The song was released to aid the [[United Nations Foundation]] in [[2010 Haiti earthquake|Haiti earthquake]] recovery efforts.<ref name="unf2010" /> It later received an official release as a digital download on February 23, 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/together-again-single/945137442 |title=Together Again - Single |publisher=[[iTunes]] |date=February 23, 2010 |access-date=February 7, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207171529/https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/together-again-single/945137442 |archive-date=February 7, 2018}}</ref>

Critics vary in terming Evanescence a [[rock music|rock]] or [[Heavy metal music|metal]] band, but most identify them as some form of gothic band. Publications such as ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Rough Guides]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' have identified Evanescence as a [[gothic metal]] act,<ref name="Berelian2005" /><ref name="nytimes080208" /><ref name="rstone061005" /> while other sources such as [[IGN]], ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' and ''[[NME]]'' have termed them [[gothic rock]].<ref name="spin100305" /><ref name="Thompson, Ed" /> They have been compared to a variety of bands from differing genres, such as [[nu metal]] ensembles like [[Linkin Park]],<ref name="rstone030325" /><ref name="allmusicNuMetal" /> gothic metal groups like [[Lacuna Coil]],<ref name="PopLacuna" /> and [[symphonic metal]] acts like [[Nightwish]] and [[Within Temptation]].<ref name="PopNightwish" /> David Browne of ''Blender'' offers an elaborate description of the band's music as "goth Christian nü-metal with a twist of melancholic [[Enya]]."<ref name="blender2006" /> Adrien Begrand of ''[[PopMatters]]'' describes Evanescence's [[guitar riff]]s to be similar to nu metal.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/evanescence-fallen |title=Evanescence: Fallen |work=[[PopMatters]] |last=Begrand

Evanescence was originally promoted in Christian stores. Later, the band made it clear they did not want to be considered part of the [[Christian rock]] genre.<ref name="YM" /> Terry Hemmings, CEO of Christian music distributor Provident, expressed puzzlement at the band's about-face, saying: "They clearly understood the album would be sold in these [Christian music] channels".<ref name="RollingStone1" /> After many Christian stores began to remove the band's music from their shelves, Wind-up Records chairman [[Alan Meltzer]] then issued a press release in April 2003 requesting formally that they do this.<ref name="BillboardPull" /> In 2006, Amy Lee told ''Billboard'' that she had opposed the "Christian band" identification from the beginning, calling it a "[[Ben Moody|Ben]] thing".<ref name="Leeunlocksdoor" /> In a 2011 interview with the ''[[San Antonio Current]]'', Lee re-affirmed her Christian faith, but once again stressed that Evanescence "has never been a 'Christian band.'"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.sacurrent.com/sanantonio/evanescence-comes-back-strong-while-keeping-jesus-mostly-out-of-it/Content?oid=2242627 |title=Evanescence comes back strong while keeping Jesus (mostly) out of it |work=[[San Antonio Current]] |first=Enrique |last=Lopetegui |date=April 1, 2011 |access-date=January 10, 2020}}</ref>
