'''Heartless Bastards''' are an American rock band formed in [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]] in 2003. The band has released six albums.

==History==
Heartless Bastards originally started as a recording project of Erika Wennerstrom. Erika played most of the instruments and featured David Colvin on drums, along with contributions from Reuben Glaser on lead guitar and Jesse Ebaugh on bass. The 5-song demo was recorded in December 2002 at Ultrasuede Studios by Shannon McGee.   Erika put together a live band and played the first live show at The Comet, a bar in the [[Cincinnati]] community of [[Northside, Cincinnati|Northside]], in August 2003. The live line up came to be a three-piece with Kevin Vaughn on drums and Mike Lamping on bass.  The band was signed to [[Fat Possum Records]] in 2004 after [[Patrick Carney]] from [[The Black Keys]] passed along a demo he received from Erika. 

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' reviewed their debut album ''Stairs and Elevators'' and said, "the Heartless Bastards are a small-town band who are ready to show the big city no mercy".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/7046239/stairs_and_elevators |title=Rolling Stone Music &#124; Album Reviews |publisher=Rollingstone.com |access-date=2012-01-08}}{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> ''[[The Village Voice]]'' wrote: "deadeye accurate in pitch and message... what we've got is a hard, gnarled voice singing simple-seeming melodies that feel archetypal rather than ordinary, which is no easier to explain than it is to do". [[Stylus Magazine|Stylus]] gave the group high praise, stating, "(Erika Wennerstrom) and her two band mates have created an album with more rocking songs and fat hooks than most bands can dream of. It’s not just that they rock, it’s that you believe what you hear, that they love the sound they make, that Wennerstrom lays her soul bare in her lyrics without sounding like [[Sarah McLachlan]], that the women of rock who labored to make it OK for a girl to dream of playing guitar deserve far better than [[Avril Lavigne]] or [[Kelly Osbourne]] as their descendants."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/the-heartless-bastards/stairs-and-elevators.htm |title=The Heartless Bastards - Stairs And Elevators - Review|publisher=Stylus Magazine |date=2005-02-15 |access-date=2012-01-08}}</ref>

The second full-length album from the band, ''[[All This Time (Heartless Bastards album)|All This Time]]'', was released on August 8, 2006.  The band road tested many of the tracks on the record prior to releasing it and received rave reviews from audiences.  The album relies less on guitar riffs and belted vocals and more on musicianship, without leaving behind the group's unique sound. On the modern rock station [[WOXY (internet radio)|WOXY]], the band was ranked No.&nbsp;12 on the 97 Best of 2005, putting the band among the likes of [[Spoon (band)|Spoon]] and ahead of [[blues rock]]ers [[The White Stripes]].<ref>[http://woxy.com/music/best05.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422182806/http://woxy.com/music/best05.php |date=April 22, 2009 }}</ref>

According to Wennerstrom, the name of the band comes from a question on a Mega Touch trivia quiz game at a bar. A question asked the name of [[Tom Petty]]'s backing band, and one of the options was "Tom Petty and the Heartless Bastards". She thought it was funny, and used it when she later formed a band.<ref>{{cite web|author=Heard on Morning Edition |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=4702414 |title='Heartless Bastards' Take Cautious Steps Into Limelight |publisher=NPR |date=2005-06-14 |access-date=2012-01-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cincygroove.com/?q=node/1017 |title=Keeping The Music Alive |publisher=Cincy Groove |access-date=2012-01-08}}</ref>

In August 2008, a new line-up for the band was announced. Erika Wennerstrom remains the only constant member, rejoined by bassist Jesse Ebaugh and original Heartless Bastards drummer Dave Colvin.

Their third album ''[[The Mountain (Heartless Bastards album)|The Mountain]]'' was released February 3, 2009 on [[Fat Possum Records]] and was produced by [[Spoon (band)|Spoon]] producer Mike McCarthy. For this album the band broadened their sound to include elements of country music, employing violin, banjo, mandolin, and steel guitar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filter-mag.com/index.php?id=18614&c=11 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130123051052/http://www.filter-mag.com/index.php?id=18614&c=11 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-01-23 |title=FILTER Magazine |publisher=Filter-mag.com |date=2011-11-25 |access-date=2012-01-08 }}</ref>
