==Early life==
Ximena Sariñana was born in [[Guadalajara]], Mexico to producer/director Fernando Sariñana and screenwriter Carolina Rivera<ref name="Xime Sariñana">{{cite web|url= http://www.tusbandas.com/pop-en-espanol/ximena-sarinana.php|title= Ximena Sariñana|access-date= March 31, 2009|last= Birchmeier|first= Jason|year= 2008|publisher= AllMusicGuide}}</ref> and was raised in [[Mexico City]]. When she was two years old, Sariñana attended an [[Ella Fitzgerald]] concert, claiming this to be the beginning of her interest in music and one of her biggest influences. She soon started listening to other artists such as [[Paul Simon]] and [[Tracy Chapman]]. She would often be seen singing and dancing and dressed up in costumes as a child. When Sariñana was 7 years old, her neighbor, singer Cecilia Toussaint, suggested she should take singing lessons with her teacher, Ricardo Sánchez, who instructed some of Mexico's biggest talents. She also took up piano lessons with Hanna Cot. In 1994, Sariñana acted in the film ''Hasta morir'' ('''Til Death''<ref name="imdb"/>), which was produced by her father.<ref name="imdbhm">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109995/|title= Hasta morir (1994)|access-date= September 14, 2008|publisher= [[Internet Movie Database]]}}</ref> Sariñana was educated at the [[Fermatta Music Academy|Academia de Musica Fermatta]], a performing arts school and [[Edron Academy]], a private multi-lingual school, both located in Mexico City.
