'''Juto''' (real name Jarius Gay) is a singer and songwriter born in [[Springfield, Missouri]], raised in Gwinnett, Georgia, and based in [[Los Angeles]]. He was the first artist signed to Travis "Taco" Bennett's (of [[Odd Future]]) RE7AX Records in association with COR/TAN Records.

Juto plays six instruments, including guitar, bass, keyboards, and trombone, and writes music influenced by the R&B, pop, and gospel music he listened to growing up. He began releasing music on [[SoundCloud]] in 2015, and in February 2018 released a 10-minute EP called ''Text Talk'' that explored love through the prism of text messaging culture.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.onestowatch.com/blog/juto-is-creating-a-glittery-hybrid-of-pop-and-rb | title = Juto is Creating a Glittery Hybrid of Pop and R&B Romanticism | publisher = Ones to Watch | last = Ramos | first = Chuck | date = 18 April 2019 | accessdate = 19 December 2019 }}</ref> The EP's four tracks were all named with texting abbreviations,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://thelunchtabletalks.com/juto-text-talk-ep/ | title = Text Message Acronyms In A 4-Track EP: ‘Text Talk’ by Juto (Review) | publisher = The Lunch Table | last = Gonzalez | first = Matthew | date = 19 April 2018 | accessdate = 20 December 2019 }}</ref> including the single "BTW" which [[Apple Music]] featured in its playlist The Plug.
