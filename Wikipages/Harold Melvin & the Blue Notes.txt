'''Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes''' were an American [[Soul music|soul]] and [[R&B]] vocal group. One of the most popular [[Philadelphia soul]] groups of the 1970s, the group's repertoire included [[soul music|soul]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[doo-wop]], and [[disco]]. Founded in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] in the middle of the 1950s as '''The Charlemagnes''', the group is most noted for several hits on [[Gamble and Huff]]'s [[Philadelphia International]] label between 1972 and 1976, although they performed and recorded until Melvin's death in 1997. Despite group founder and original lead singer Harold Melvin's top billing, the Blue Notes' most famous member was [[Teddy Pendergrass]], their lead singer during the successful years at Philadelphia International. The remaining members of the Blue Notes have reunited for Soul Train Cruises in 2013, 2015, and 2017.

==History==
===Early years===
The group formerly known as The Charlemagnes took on the name "The Blue Notes" in 1954, with a line-up consisting of lead singer Franklin Peaker, Bernard Wilson, Roosevelt Brodie, Jesse Gillis, Jr., and Harold Melvin.<ref name="LarkinSM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Soul Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-733-9|pages=176/7}}</ref> The group recorded for a number of labels without success from its inception into the 1960s. The 1960 single "My Hero" was a minor hit for Val-ue Records,<ref name="LarkinSM"/> and 1965's "Get Out (and Let Me Cry)" was an R&B hit for Landa Records. During this period, the group's line-up changed frequently, with Bernard Wilson leaving the act to start a group called "The Original Blue Notes", and Harold Melvin bringing in new lead singer John Atkins.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> In 1970, the group recruited [[Teddy Pendergrass]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/teddy-mw0000653079|title=Teddy - Teddy Pendergrass - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}</ref> as the drummer for their backing band.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Pendergrass had been a member of Philadelphia R&B group The Cadillacs (not the New York group that had hits in the late 1950s) and was promoted to lead singer when John Atkins quit the same year.<ref name="LarkinSM"/>

===Philadelphia International success===
This line-up of the group, featuring Melvin, Pendergrass, Bernard Wilson, Lawrence Brown, and Lloyd Parks, was signed to [[Gamble & Huff]]'s [[Philadelphia International]] label in 1972.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Lloyd Parks was replaced by Jerry Cummings that same year.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Shortly after the arrival of Cummings, the Notes scored several major R&B and pop hits including million-selling singles and albums over the next four years.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Among the Blue Notes' most important and successful recordings are love songs such as 1972's "[[If You Don't Know Me by Now]]" (number 1 Billboard R&B, number 3 pop), their breakout single, "I Miss You" (number 7 R&B, number 58 pop), "[[The Love I Lost]]" (number 1 R&B, number 7 pop, 1973) and socially conscious songs such as "[[Wake Up Everybody (Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes song)|Wake Up Everybody]]" (number 1 R&B, number 12 pop) and "[[Bad Luck (Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes song)|Bad Luck]]" (number 4 R&B, number 15 pop), both in 1975.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> "If You Don't Know Me By Now" sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] on November 21, 1972.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

}}</ref> "Bad Luck" holds the record for the longest-running number-one hit on the [[Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] chart: 11 weeks. A fourth number 1 R&B hit for the group was 1975's "Hope That We Can Be Together Soon" which featured female vocalist Sharon Paige.

A 1976 remake of "Don't Leave Me This Way" by [[Motown]] artist [[Thelma Houston]] was a number-one hit on the US pop chart. The Blue Notes' version on the album, ''Wake Up Everybody'', was not released as a single in the US at the time, but proved to be the group's biggest hit in the UK (number 5) when released there as a single in 1977.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> The track was finally issued as a single in the US on 12-inch in 1979, coupled with "Bad Luck". The group recorded four albums with Gamble & Huff, all of them going gold (over 500,000 copies), according to RIAA, including ''To Be True'' (number 26, Billboard Top 40 albums) and ''Wake Up Everybody'' (number 9), both in 1975. ''Wake Up Everybody'' and a greatest hits compilation released in 1976, ''Collector's Item'', has now sold over a million copies.

Despite the success, the Blue Notes' line-up continued to change regularly. In 1972, Melvin brought in Jerry Cummings to replace Lloyd Parks and Sharon Paige was added to the line-up at that time, providing solo performances on several recordings.  While at the top of their success in 1976, Pendergrass quit after an argument over the money he earned.<ref name="LarkinSM"/>  A year earlier, he had gained billing recognition by having the act renamed to "Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes featuring Theodore Pendergrass", starting from the ''Wake Up Everybody'' album. Pendergrass went on to a successful solo career,<ref name="LarkinSM"/> with four consecutive million-selling albums with Philadelphia International between 1977 and 1981. His career was almost ended by a paralyzing 1982 car accident. He made a triumphant comeback in 1984, signing with Asylum/[[Elektra Records]], and recording the hit LP ''Love Language'' and then the platinum-selling ''[[Joy (Teddy Pendergrass album)|Joy]]'' LP, released in 1988, which featured the Grammy-nominated title song, an R&B number 1; his comeback was cemented by an appearance at the [[Live Aid]] concert in 1985.

===Later years===
Melvin replaced Pendergrass with [[David Ebo (singer)|David Ebo]].<ref name="LarkinSM"/> The Blue Notes departed Philadelphia International (who had signed Pendergrass for solo recordings) and joined  [[ABC Records]] in 1977, where they recorded two albums produced by Melvin.<ref name="LarkinSM"/>  "Reaching for the World" (number 7 R&B, number 74 pop) became the group's last major-selling single.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Harold Melvin, Jerry Cummings, and new members Dwight Johnson, David Ebo and William Spratley released ''The Blue Album'' in 1980 on Source Records, an imprint of [[MCA Records]], which had acquired ABC Records in 1979.  Their final album for MCA, ''All Things Happen in Time'', was released in 1981.<ref name="LarkinSM"/>

[[Gil Saunders]] took the lead position in 1982, replacing David Ebo. With Gil Saunders, the group had success in the United Kingdom with the Philly World album ''Talk It Up (Tell Everybody)'', and singles such as "Today's Your Lucky Day" and "Don't Give Me Up". Several of the Pendergrass-era hits were re-recorded in the UK with Gil Saunders on lead. Saunders left the act in 1992, and Harold Melvin continued to tour with various line-ups of Blue Notes, until suffering a [[stroke]] in 1996. 

Melvin died on March 24, 1997 at the age of 57<ref name="melvindead">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/27/arts/harold-melvin-57-led-the-blue-notes-to-success-in-the-70-s.html|title= Harold Melvin, 57; Led the Blue Notes To Success in the 70's|date=March 27, 1997|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|page=1|access-date=2011-11-03}}{{subscription required}}</ref> and was laid to rest at the [[Ivy Hill Cemetery (Philadelphia)|Ivy Hill Cemetery]] in Philadelphia.

===Legacy===
Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes hits have been re-recorded by other artists, including [[David Ruffin]], [[Simply Red]], [[Jimmy Somerville]], [[Sybil Lynch|Sybil]], [[The Three Degrees]] and [[John Legend]], while dance music DJ [[Danny Rampling]] cites "Wake Up Everybody" as his favorite song of all time. Gil Saunders continued to perform as a solo artist, and performed all the hits of the past as well as his own material. Several members of various incarnations of the Blue Notes continue to tour as "Harold Melvin's Blue Notes". Melvin's widow, Ovelia currently manages Harold Melvin's Blue Notes, featuring lead singer Donnell "Big Daddy" Gillespie, Anthony Brooks, Rufus Thorne and John Morris. For his album ''[[This Note's for You]]'', singer [[Neil Young]] named his back-up band, The Blue Notes, without permission from name rights holder Harold Melvin.  Melvin took legal action against Young over use of the Blue Notes name, forcing the singer to change the name of the back-up band to "Ten Men Workin'" during the balance of the tour that promoted the ''This Note's for You'' album.

The band is mentioned on [[Snoop Dogg]]'s 1993 album ''[[Doggystyle]]''.  In the intro for "[[Doggy Dogg World]]" Snoop says "Bitch, you without me is like Harold Melvin without the Blue Notes, you'll never go platinum!" Former member Jerry Cummings is an ordained minister and has been asked to form Jerry Cummings' Blue Notes but has turned down the offer. As of May 2014 Jerry Cummings became the Music Life Coach and producer of the X Factor superstar Lillie McCloud and Lillie has recorded one of Cummings' songs "The Other Part of Me".  Rapper [[Big Boi]] uses a sample of "I Miss You" on his song "Shine Blockas" feat. Gucci Mane. "I Miss You" was also sampled by [[Kanye West]] on [[Jay-Z]]'s song "This Can't Be Life", featuring [[Beanie Sigel]] and [[Scarface (rapper)|Scarface]]. Also the R&B singer [[Pleasure P]] used a sample of "I Miss You" on his song "Letter To My Ex" recorded in 2013.
