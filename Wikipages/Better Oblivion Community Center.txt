==Background==
Oberst and Bridgers first met in July 2016, when she performed at a secret showcase he was hosting at the Bootleg Theater in Los Angeles.<ref name="Billboard">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8494747/conor-oberst-phoebe-bridgers-better-oblivion-community-center-album-interview|title=Conor Oberst and Phoebe Bridgers On Their Surprise Joint Album 'Better Oblivion Community Center'|last=Reilly|first=Phoebe|date=January 24, 2019|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=January 24, 2019}}</ref> A mutual friend of theirs was helping organize the event and told Oberst that Bridgers was his favorite songwriter in LA at the time, so he invited her to play and was so impressed that he immediately asked her to send him the record she was working on.<ref name="BOCCDeadOceans">{{cite web |title=Better Oblivion Community Center: About |url=https://deadoceans.com/artists/better-oblivion-community-center/ |website=Dead Oceans |publisher=Dead Oceans}}</ref> She then opened for him on his European ''[[Ruminations (album)|Ruminations]]'' tour in January of 2017,<ref name="BrooklynVegan">{{cite web |last1=Sacher |first1=Andrew |title=Phoebe Bridgers releasing a new single, touring with Conor Oberst |url=https://www.brooklynvegan.com/phoebe-bridgers-releasing-a-new-single-touring-with-conor-oberst/ |website=Brooklyn Vegan}}</ref> and they continued to collaborate consistently over the following two years. He brought her onstage to sing the [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]] song "Lua" at [[WXPN]]'s Xponential Music Festival that July, he sang on the duet "Would You Rather" from her debut ''[[Stranger in the Alps]]'' in September, they covered Sheryl Crow with [[Soccer Mommy]] at the [[Music Hall of Williamsburg]] in February 2018, and they worked together on a new version of his song “LAX” for Amazon Music in October, among numerous other joint appearances at each other’s shows across the U.S.<ref name="TheMorningCall">{{cite web |last1=Moser |first1=John J. |title=REVIEW: At XPoNential Fest, Wilco sounds good but exposes faults; Conor Oberst eviscerates Trump in great set |url=https://www.mcall.com/entertainment/lehigh-valley-music/mc-ent-xponential-festival-review-wilco-trump-oberst-20170729-story.html |website=The Morning Call}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-conor-oberst-phoebe-bridgers-20190124-story.html|title=Phoebe Bridgers and Conor Oberst clandestinely make an L.A.-inspired album|last=Brown|first=August|date=January 24, 2019|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=January 24, 2019}}</ref><ref name="Uproxx1">{{cite web |last1=Halabian |first1=Layla |title=Phoebe Bridgers, Conor Oberst, And Soccer Mommy Covered Sheryl Crow In A Moment Of Indie Rock Triumph |url=https://uproxx.com/music/phoebe-bridgers-conor-oberst-soccer-mommy-sheryl-crow-cover/ |website=Uproxx}}</ref><ref name="Uproxx2">{{cite web |last1=Gilke |first1=Chloe |title=Conor Oberst And Phoebe Bridgers Collaborate Again On A New Version Of His Song ‘LAX’ |url=https://uproxx.com/music/conor-obsert-phoebe-bridgers-lax-new-song/ |website=Uproxx}}</ref>

The initial idea of forming the band apparently stemmed from Bridgers complimenting a cover Oberst had done of a [[The Replacements (band)|Replacements]] song one night, and him replying that they should start a band and sound like the Replacements.<ref name="GQBOCC">{{cite web |last1=Gayomali |first1=Chris |title=Conor Oberst and Phoebe Bridgers Imagine a Better Oblivion |url=https://www.gq.com/story/better-oblivion-community-center-interview |website=GQ |publisher=Conde Nast}}</ref> When they first started writing together, they hadn’t planned on putting out a record, and they thought they might be writing for one of each other’s solo efforts or for a third party. Bridgers has said that it’s common for Oberst to dream up “fake bands,” so she didn’t know that he was being serious until they had written “like, five songs.”<ref name="GQBOCC" /> They mentioned that they wanted to create a separate project with its own name so that they could feel free to create a sound different than their individual solo acts.<ref name="BOCCDeadOceans" />
