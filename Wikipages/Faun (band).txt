'''Faun''' is a German band that was formed in 1998 and plays [[pagan folk]], [[darkwave]], and [[medieval music]]. The originality of their music style is that it falls back to "old" instruments, and the singing is always the center of attention. The vocals are performed in a variety of languages, including German, English, Latin, Greek, and Scandinavian languages. Their instruments include [[Celtic harp]], Swedish [[nyckelharpa]], [[hurdy-gurdy]], [[bagpipe]]s, [[cittern]], [[flute]]s, and many others.

==History==

The band was founded in 1998 by Oliver s. Tyr, Elisabeth Pawelke, Fiona Rüggeberg, and Birgit Muggenthaler. Two years later, Rüdiger Maul joined the band as a percussionist. At the same time, Birgit left the band to continue her musical life with the folk-rock band [[Schandmaul]]. In 2002, they released their first album ''Zaubersprüche''. Niel Mitra was a guest musician on this album, and he later became a full-time member of the band, the only one playing only electronic instruments.

In 2003, the band released its second album, ''Licht'', and performed at several festivals in support of this music.<ref name=reflections>[http://www.reflectionsofdarkness.com/artists-f-j-concertreviews-158/13625-live-review-faun-berlin-2013 " Live Review: Faun – Berlin 2013"]. ''Reflections of Darkness'' 08 November 2013 Johannes Steigmann</ref>

Elisabeth Pawelke left Faun in 2008 to focus on her studies in classical song in [[Basel]], Switzerland. She was succeeded by Sandra Elflein, who left Faun in April 2010 due to a pregnancy and health issues. Singer and multi-instrumentalist Rairda replaced her but left the band in 2012. She was succeeded by Katja Moslehner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/1539449/faun/biography|title=Faun – Biography {{!}} Billboard|website=www.billboard.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-03}}</ref>

In 2013, the band toured Europe, including Berlin.<ref name=reflections /> Later that year, they published their seventh studio album ''[[Von den Elben]]'', which became the first Faun album to reach top ten positions in the album charts of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, and was also their first album to chart in the latter two countries.<ref name="Charts GER">{{cite web|url=https://www.offiziellecharts.de/suche?artistId=Faun|title=Discographie von Faun|publisher=GfK Entertainment|access-date=20 November 2019}}</ref><ref name="Charts AUT">{{cite web|url=http://austriancharts.at/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Faun |title=Discographie Faun – austriancharts.at |language=de |publisher=Hung Medien |access-date=1 September 2016}}</ref><ref name="Charts SWI">{{cite web|url=http://hitparade.ch/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Faun |title=Faun – hitparade.ch |language=de |publisher=Hung Medien |access-date=1 September 2016}}</ref> It was nominated for the [[ECHO (music award)|ECHO]] award in the categories 'National Rock/Pop Group'<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.echopop.de/pop-gruppe-national-rock/ |title=Nominierte 2014: Gruppe Rock/Pop National |language=de |work=[[ECHO (music award)|Echo]] |publisher=[[Bundesverband Musikindustrie]] |access-date=27 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330072716/http://www.echopop.de/pop-gruppe-national-rock/ |archive-date=30 March 2014 }}</ref> and 'National Newcomer of the Year'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.echopop.de/pop-newcomer-national/ |title=Nominierte 2014: Newcomer National |language=de |work=[[ECHO (music award)|Echo]] |publisher=[[Bundesverband Musikindustrie]] |access-date=27 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330072822/http://www.echopop.de/pop-newcomer-national/ |archive-date=30 March 2014 }}</ref>

==Style==

===Music===
[[File:Burgfolk Festival 2013 - Faun 19.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Faun in 2013]]
Faun is a prime example of "Mittelalter" music, a German musical style mixing [[Medieval]] folk and [[folk metal]]. To express their own bond with nature the band coined the term "Pagan Folk" for one style of their concerts. While the term was initially used for electronically amplified concerts only, it is now used by fans and band for their music itself. A quote by Oliver Pade reveals another possibility for having chosen this specific term: "We don't know ourselves what kind of music we play, so we call it paganfolk" (Oliver Pade 2004 in a song announcement at the 2004 Summer Darkness in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], Netherlands). The ''[[Münchner Merkur]]'' defines it as "a sometimes experimental mix of folk elements, medieval and traditional music from different epochs and regions as well as modern, even electronic influences".<ref>{{cite news |last=Leichsenring |first=Thomas |date=24 August 2020 |url=https://www.merkur.de/lokales/dachau/dachau-ort28553/die-romantik-vergangener-zeiten-90024320.html |title=Die Romantik vergangener Zeiten |work=[[Münchner Merkur]] |language=de |access-date=27 August 2020 |quote=...Pagan-Folk – ein mitunter experimenteller Mix aus Folkelementen, mittelalterlicher und traditioneller Musik aus verschiedenen Epochen und Regionen sowie modernen, sogar elektronischen Einflüssen. }}</ref>

Faun's repertoire ranges from melancholic ballads to exuberant dances like the [[Brittany|Brittanic]] [[An Dro]]. Thereby they set historical tunes from various periods and regions to music and on the other hand create a lot of their own compositions as well.

Faun combines ancient [[Persian traditional music|Perso]]-[[Arabic music|Arab]] melodies with the Swedish nyckelharpa and [[Middle High German]] lyrics. Equally distinguishing are Pawelke's and Rüggeberg's singing, mostly in two voices and, on newer recordings, the driving beat by Niel Mitra. Mitra has described the essence of the band as a form of "musical [[alchemy]]", due to the different musical interests of the members and how they are combined in Faun's music.<ref name="nightshade">Otti. 19 March 2006. [https://www.nightshade-magazin.de/beitrag.php?beitrag_id=121 Nightshade Interview - Faun]. Nightshade.</ref>

The debut album ''Zaubersprüche'' deals mainly with slow ballads from the era between the [[Late Middle Ages]] and [[Romanticism]]. The instrumentation is kept entirely acoustic and waives modern instruments and electronic beats. The second album features far less ballads but offers considerably more danceable tunes like ''Andro'', ''Unda'' or the double song ''Deva/Punagra''.

===Lyrics===

The lyrics originate from very different languages, [[Standard German]], [[Middle High German]], [[Old Icelandic]], [[Low German]], [[Old Norse]], [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], and [[Ladino language|Ladino]] among them. Among lyrics of their own, the group uses or writes lyrics inspired by classical texts such as the [[Carmina Burana]] ("Satyros", "Renaissance"), the [[Cantigas de Santa Maria]] ("Da que Deus", "Renaissance"), [[Jenaer Liederhandschrift]] from [[Vitslav III, Prince of Rügen]] ("Loibere Risen", "Renaissance"), [[Egils Saga]] ("Licht"), the [[Poetic Edda]] ("Sigurdlied", "Buch der Balladen"), [[Heinrich von Morungen]] ("Von den Elben", "Licht"), the [[ballad]] [[King Henry (song)|King Henry]], as well as from romantic and modern authors such as [[John Keats]] ("Der Wilde Wasermann", "Buch der Balladen"), [[Baron Munchausen]] ("2 Falken", "Totem" and "Jahrtausendalt", "Buch der Balladen"), [[José Melchor Gomis]] ("Tinta", "Totem"), [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff]] ("Der stille Grund", "Totem"), [[Felicitas Kukuck]] ("Tanz über die Brücke", Buch der Balladen") and others.

Faun seek to promote a form of [[paganism]] they characterise as [[nature religion]]. They are however not hostile to Christian culture and are open to performing Christian songs. They have stressed that many Christian traditions have a pagan origin or pagan components. Oliver s. Tyr has said that he is opposed to the church, but regards Christianity as a good religion and thinks it is better to be a Christian than to have no faith at all.<ref name="nightshade" />

===Meaning of the name===

[[File:FaunLogo.svg|thumb|The band's logo]]

The name Faun comes from ancient [[Greek mythology|Greek]]-[[Roman mythology|Roman]] mythology, where it equals the herders' deity [[Faunus]] or [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]. According to the band, this figure which is often also depicted as a natural or forestal spirit, shall express the members' connection with nature. For the same reason Oliver Pade's pseudonym is the [[Satyr]], who is closely related to Faunus.
