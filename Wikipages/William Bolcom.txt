'''William Elden Bolcom''' (born May 26, 1938) is an American [[composer]] and [[piano|pianist]]. He has received the [[Pulitzer Prize]], the National Medal of Arts, a{{r|Bolcom_ND}} [[Grammy Award]], the [[Detroit Music Award]] and was named 2007 Composer of the Year by Musical America. He taught composition at the [[University of Michigan]] from 1973 until 2008. He is married to [[mezzo-soprano]] [[Joan Morris]].

==Early life and education==
Bolcom was born in [[Seattle, Washington]]. At age 11, he entered the [[University of Washington]] to study [[musical composition|composition]] privately with [[George Frederick McKay]] and [[John Verrall]] and [[piano]] with Madame Berthe Poncy Jacobson. "He later studied with [[Darius Milhaud]] at [[Mills College]] while working on his Master of Arts degree, with [[Leland Smith]] at [[Stanford University]] while working on his D.M.A., and with [[Olivier Messiaen]] at the [[Paris Conservatoire]], where he received the 2ème Prix de Composition".{{r|Bolcom2017}}

==Career==
Bolcom won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for music in 1988 for ''[[12 New Etudes for Piano]]''.{{r|Pulitzer1988}} In the fall of 1994, he was named the [[Ross Lee Finney]] Distinguished University Professor of Composition at the [[University of Michigan]].  In 2006, he was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]]. Notable students include [[Gabriela Lena Frank]], [[Carter Pann]], [[Elena Ruehr]], [[Derek Bermel]], [[Joel Puckett]], and [[David T. Little]].

As a pianist, Bolcom has performed and recorded frequently in collaboration with Joan Morris, whom he married in 1975.{{r|GroveDict2001_Bolcom}} They have recorded more than two dozen albums together, beginning with the Grammy-nominated ''After the Ball,'' a collection of popular songs from around the turn of the 20th century. Their primary specialties in both concerts and recordings are show tunes, parlor, and popular songs from the late 19th and early 20th century by [[Henry Russell (musician)|Henry Russell]], [[Henry Clay Work]] and others, and [[cabaret]] songs. 

As a soloist, Bolcom has recorded his own compositions, as well as music by [[George Gershwin]], Milhaud{{r|GroveDict2001_Bolcom}} and several of the classic [[ragtime]] composers. His compositions have been recognized and highlighted at Michigan State University in their Michigan Writers Series.{{r|MathsonETAL2002}}

==Works==
{{main list|List of compositions by William Bolcom}}
Bolcom's earliest compositions were written when he was around eleven years old; his early influences include [[Roy Harris]] and [[Béla Bartók]]. His compositions from around 1960 employed a modified [[Serialism|serial technique]], under the influence of [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], and [[Luciano Berio]], whose music he particularly admired. In the 1960s he gradually began to embrace an eclectic use of a wider variety of musical styles. His goal has been to erase boundaries between [[Popular music|popular music]] and [[art music]].{{r|GroveDict2001_Bolcom}}

He has composed four major operas. Three of them, ''[[McTeague (opera)|McTeague]]'', ''[[A View from the Bridge]]'', and ''[[A Wedding (opera)|A Wedding]]'' were commissioned and premiered by the [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]] and conducted by [[Dennis Russell Davies]]. All of these were composed with librettist [[Arnold Weinstein]], sometimes in collaboration with other writers. ''McTeague'', based on the [[McTeague|1899 novel]] by [[Frank Norris]], with libretto by Weinstein, was premiered on October 31, 1992. ''A View from the Bridge'', with libretto by Weinstein and [[Arthur Miller]], was premiered October 9, 1999. ''A Wedding'', based on the [[A Wedding (1978 film)|1978 motion picture]] by [[Robert Altman]] and [[John Considine (actor)|John Considine]], with libretto by Weinstein and Altman, was premiered on December 11, 2004. His fourth opera, [[Dinner at Eight (opera)|''Dinner at Eight'']], composed with librettist [[Mark Campbell (librettist)|Mark Campbell]], based on the [[George S. Kaufman]] and [[Edna Ferber]] play of the same name, was premiered March 11, 2017, by the commissioning organization, Minnesota Opera.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

He has also composed concertos such as ''Lyric Concerto'' for Flute and Orchestra for [[James Galway]], the Concerto in D for Violin and Orchestra for [[Sergiu Luca]], the Concerto for Clarinet and Orchestra for [[Stanley Drucker]], and Concert Suite for [[alto saxophone]] and [[band (music)|band]], composed for University of Michigan professor [[Donald Sinta]] in 1998. He composed his concerto ''[[Gaea for Two Pianos Left Hand, and Orchestra|Gaea]]'' for two pianos (left hand) and orchestra for [[Gary Graffman]] and [[Leon Fleisher]], both of whom have suffered from debilitating problems with their right hands.  It received its first performance on April 11, 1996 by the Baltimore Symphony conducted by [[David Zinman]]. The concerto is constructed so that it can be performed in one of three ways, with either piano part alone with reduced orchestra, or with both piano parts and the two reduced orchestras combined into a full orchestra. This structure mimics that of a similar three-in-one work by his teacher, [[Darius Milhaud]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Bolcom's other works include nine [[symphony|symphonies]], twelve string quartets, four violin sonatas, a number of [[Ragtime|piano rags]] (one written in collaboration with [[William Albright (musician)|William Albright]]), four volumes of ''Gospel Preludes'' for organ, four volumes of cabaret songs, three musical theater works (''Casino Paradise'', ''Dynamite Tonite'', and ''Greatshot''; all with Weinstein), and a one-act chamber opera, ''Lucrezia'', with librettist Mark Campbell. William Bolcom was also commissioned to write ''Recuerdos'' for two pianos by [[The Dranoff International Two Piano Foundation]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

=== Song cycles ===
Bolcom has written a number of song cycles. A very large portion of these song cycles were cabarets with lyrics by librettist/lyricist Arnold Weinstein and meant to be sung by mezzo-soprano Joan Morris,{{r|Holland2007}} William Bolcom's wife. These 24 cabarets were released in four volumes from the 1970s to the 1990s{{r|AACCLib_a}}{{Failed verification|date=November 2018}}<!--Inaccessible subscription-only website.--> and were released all together on CD. Among Bolcom's other song cycles, the most well-known is his setting of William Blake's ''Songs of Innocence and of Experience.'' The recording of this massive work was estimated at $375,000 USD and its length stands at about two and a half hours.{{r|AACCLib_a}}{{Failed verification|date=November 2018}}<!--Inaccessible subscription-only website.-->.

===''Songs of Innocence and of Experience''===

Bolcom's setting of [[William Blake]]'s ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'', a three-hour work for soloists, choruses, and orchestra, was a culmination of 25 years of work on the piece.

:'''Inspiration '''
::At the age of seventeen, William Bolcom wanted to set the complete poems of ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'' by [[William Blake]] to music.{{r|Lister2006}} As he comprehended the huge diversity of the artistic ideas and the technical styles presented in the poems, he realized that he needed more musical vocabulary of different styles in order to complete his music. This realization also bolstered his ideas that genres of music should not be placed in a hierarchy and that there was no distinction between "serious" music and "popular" music.{{r|Hu2004}}

:'''Style and instrumentation'''
::Bolcom incorporated a variety of different musical styles and genres in the music, including modern classical style using pentatonic scales, tonal classical style, bluegrass, country, soul, folk vaudeville, rock musical, and reggae. Bolcom has used instruments that are not usually used in a traditional orchestra but are used in the genres that he chose: saxophones, guitar, electric guitar, bass guitar, harmonica, electric violin, and "country, rock, and folk singers".{{r|WBConversation2019}}

:'''Premiere and performances'''
::According to [[Naxos Records]], the premiere of the ''Songs'' at the Stuttgart Opera in 1984 was followed by performances in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Carnegie Hall]], and [[London]]'s [[Royal Festival Hall]], the latter performed by the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] under the direction of [[Leonard Slatkin]].{{r|Naxos2004_Slatkin}}

:'''Awards and reception'''
::In 2004, Naxos Records produced a recording of the ''Songs'' on location at [[Hill Auditorium]], featuring the [[University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance]] Symphony Orchestra, the student choirs from the same university, [[University Musical Society|University Musical Society Choral Union]], [[Michigan State University Children's Choir]], and a variety of solo instrumentalists and singers (who also included [[Joan Morris]], wife of Bolcom). In 2006, it won four [[Grammy Award]]s for Best Choral Performance, Best Classical Contemporary Composition, Best Classical Album, and Best Producer of the Year, Classical.{{r|NPRMusic20060209}}

::Composer and critic Robert Carl has stated that Bolcom wrote seemingly disparate genres of music with "sincerity," without irony, "as equal partners," and with "love for and mastery of popular music".{{r|Carl1990}}{{Page needed|date=March 2018}}

==Festivals==
VocalEssence celebrated the music of William Bolcom with a two-week festival in [[Minneapolis]] and [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] in April 2007. Nine different performances and a number of [[master class]]es were part of the festival.
