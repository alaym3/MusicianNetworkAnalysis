==Biography==

=== Personal life ===
Pedro began his career at age 12 in 2014, but starting singing at the young age of 8 years old in a bazaar in Vila Maria, a neighborhood in the North Zone of [[São Paulo]]. He was mainly influenced by the popular genre of his environment. The first song to jump start his career is titled "Dom Dom Dom". The song was made in collaboration with MC Livinho, and its lyrics were clearly related to oral sex. One of the versus states: "Get on your knees, get ready and give a nice blowjob." This song was released when Pedro was only 11 years old, a fact that was not well received by the media. A few months later Pedro launched a light version of the song, whose video clip was produced by Rio Tom Productions, without sex references. After this, he said in an interview that he would switch to the pop genre. He followed this path for a long time and continued making music in the so-called ''funk ousadia'' genre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musica.uol.com.br/noticias/redacao/2015/01/29/mp-quer-proibir-musicas-de-mc-pedrinho-em-todo-o-territorio-nacional.htm|title=MP quer proibir músicas de MC Pedrinho em todo o território nacional|work=uol.com.br}}</ref>

One of his songs which also was successful and ended up being directed more toward the funk fanfare was the "Differentiated Life" song with the participation of the renowned [[MC Léo da Baixada]]. According to an interview with G1 portal, Pedrinho says the funk you enabled a huge improvement in living conditions, and as a child went hungry. Among his other hit songs along the lines of [[proibidão]] are "Hit do Verão", "Matemática" and "Geometria da Putaria" which placed it as a major funk scene revelations in 2015. His page on Facebook accumulates about 2.5&nbsp;million fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/ceara/noticia/2015/01/justica-proibe-show-de-mc-pedrinho-em-fortaleza.html|title=G1 – Justiça proíbe show de MC Pedrinho em Fortaleza – notícias em Ceará|work=Ceará}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://entretenimento.r7.com/pop/musica/fotos/com-carrao-e-jatinho-mc-leo-da-baixada-e-mc-pedrinho-lancam-clipe-juntos-assista-25082014|title=Com carrão e jatinho, MC Léo da Baixada e MC Pedrinho lançam clipe juntos; assista|work=r7.com|access-date=August 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205221313/http://entretenimento.r7.com/pop/musica/fotos/com-carrao-e-jatinho-mc-leo-da-baixada-e-mc-pedrinho-lancam-clipe-juntos-assista-25082014|archive-date=February 5, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The claim of the prosecutor Luciano Tonet was that Pedrinho had a "musical repertoire endowed with clear sexual connotations, high erotic content, pornography, profanity and all kinds of vulgarity, incompatible with the specific conditions of the developing person". The next day, the prosecutor expressed the desire to ban the singer's songs throughout the national territory on the grounds of "a model for others". However, the singer was not bothered by the ban attempt and, just three days later, released another song with sexual content. Despite criticism of Pedrinho's lyrics, his mother, Analee Maia, said that she supports him in every way, but that she prefers the songs without swearing; another interesting fact is that he has said in several interviews that he never [[making out|made out]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entretenimento.r7.com/pop/fotos/funkeiro-de-12-anos-mc-pedrinho-lanca-proibidao-com-letra-sexual-apos-ter-show-cancelado-pela-justica-02022015#!/foto/1|title=Funkeiro de 12 anos, MC Pedrinho lança proibidão com letra sexual após ter show cancelado pela Justiça|work=r7.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vermelho.org.br/noticia/257204-11|title=Renato Barreiros: Ostentação em crise|work=vermelho.org.br}}</ref>
