'''Son Lux''' is an American [[experimental music|experimental]] band. Originally the solo project and moniker of founding member [[Ryan Lott]], the band's first three albums, ''[[At War with Walls & Mazes]]'', ''[[We Are Rising]]'' and ''[[Lanterns (Son Lux album)|Lanterns]]'' shaped the band's unique sound through [[post-rock]] and [[electronica]] influences.

With the release of their fourth studio album, ''[[Bones (Son Lux album)|Bones]]'', in 2015, [[Rafiq Bhatia]] and Ian Chang joined Son Lux, transforming the project into a three-piece band. After the release of their [[extended play|EP]]s ''Stranger Forms'' and ''Remedy'', the band's fifth album, ''[[Brighter Wounds]]'', was released in February 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/and-then-there-were-three-an-interview-with-son-lux/|title=And Then There Were Three: An Interview with Son Lux|date=2016-02-24|work=PopMatters|access-date=2018-02-11|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web |url=https://sonlux.bandcamp.com/album/brighter-wounds |title=Brighter Wounds, by Son Lux |website=[[Bandcamp]] |access-date=2019-04-13}}</ref>

Son Lux started in 2008 as the moniker and solo recording project of American musician and composer [[Ryan Lott]]. Their debut studio album, ''[[At War with Walls & Mazes]]'', was released in March of that same year.<ref name=amg>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/son-lux-mn0000989492|title=Son Lux|website=[[AllMusic]]|first=Marisa|last=Brown}}</ref> Following this release, NPR named Son Lux "Best New Artist" on their program ''[[All Songs Considered]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2008/12/08/97939029/the-year-in-music-from-all-songs-considered|title=The Year In Music From All Songs Considered|website=Npr.org|access-date=2018-02-11|language=en}}</ref>

Lott then released the second album ''[[We Are Rising]]'' on May 17, 2011, recorded in the entire month of February for the [[RPM Challenge]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchfork.com/news/42037-new-release-son-lux-we-are-rising/|title=New Release: Son Lux: We Are Rising|publisher=Pitchfork Media|first=Larry|last=Fitzmauriceon|date=March 28, 2011}}</ref> Adam Kivel, writing for ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'', described the album as "the dark, operatic middle ground between Owen Pallett and ''[[In Rainbows]]''-era [[Radiohead]] or [[Wild Beasts]]' fantastic, operatic heights."<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Kivel|first=Adam|title=Album Review: Son Lux - We Are Rising|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2011/05/album-review-son-lux-we-are-rising/|magazine=Consequence of Sound|access-date=2013-10-24}}</ref>

Son Lux signed with [[Joyful Noise Recordings]] in May 2013, the same month that their "haunting rendition" of "Black Waters" was featured in the epnoymous [[Flexi disc|flexi-disc]] series released by Joyful Noise.
