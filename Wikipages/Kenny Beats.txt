== Early life ==
Kenneth Blume III was born and raised in Greenwich, Connecticut.  He has been studying music since the age of 9 when he started playing the guitar, playing drums since the age of 11, and producing music since his sophomore year of high school.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|date=2019-12-13|title=Biography {{!}} www.kennybeats.com|url=https://kennybeats.wordpress.com/biography/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191213025001/https://kennybeats.wordpress.com/biography/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2019-12-13|access-date=2021-07-06}}</ref><ref name=":1" />  His first guitar was a Fender Stratocaster and his first amplifier was a Fender Hot-Rod Deluxe.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Amazing Producer and Songwriter Kenny Beats Demonstrates How the American Professional II Telecaster Is a Perfect Studio Guitar {{!}} Fender|url=https://www.fender.com/articles/artists/kenny-beats|access-date=2021-07-06|website=www.fender.com|language=en-US}}</ref>  During his junior year at Greenwich High School, he was able to enter a national electronic-music competition hosted by the National Association for Music Education (NAFME) and the National School Boards Association (NSBA).<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|date=2008-05-23|title=2008 NSBA Student Electronic Music Composition Talent Search Winners|url=https://nafme.org/2008-nsba-student-electronic-music-composition-talent-search-winners/|access-date=2021-07-06|website=NAfME|language=en-US}}</ref>  Blume III won second place in the competition, which motivated him to start taking music production seriously.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" />

After he graduated high school, he moved to New York, where he started interning for Cinematic Music Group in the summer of 2010.<ref name=":0" />  His internship at CMG led to his collaboration with artist Smoke DZA on 4 of his albums.<ref name=":0" />  It was also during the year 2010 when his music attracted the attention of Levi Maestro, leading to their collaboration on an ad campaign for Brisk.<ref name=":0" />  After spending some time in NY, he moved to Boston and studied Jazz Guitar and Music Business at Berklee College of Music.<ref name=":1">{{cite web |last1=Schwartz |first1=Danny |title=How Kenny Beats Became the Hottest Rap Producer on the Planet |url=https://www.theringer.com/music/2018/12/14/18139824/kenny-beats-best-rap-producer-2018-key-vince-staples-freddie-gibbs |website=The Ringer |access-date=2020-01-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416202815/https://www.theringer.com/music/2018/12/14/18139824/kenny-beats-best-rap-producer-2018-key-vince-staples-freddie-gibbs |archive-date=2020-04-16 |url-status=live}}</ref>

== Musical style ==
Kenny's production style varies. His [[Digital audio workstation]] (DAW) of choice is [[Ableton Live]]. He plays piano, bass guitar, electric guitar<ref>{{Cite web|title=KENNY BEATS - HOW TO MAKE A GUITAR SAMPLE - TUTORIAL - LIVE (03/31/20) 🔥🔥 - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i86bG2OsOSQ|access-date=2020-12-29|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref> & drums and often implements live instrumentation into his instrumentals, whether it performed by him or from a fellow instrumentalist.<ref>{{Cite web|title=quarantine - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R6ZetBOnUs|access-date=2020-12-29|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref name="youtube.com">{{Cite web|title=[KENNY BEATS] Phone Numbers - Dominic Fike {{!}} BREAKDOWN - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzn-KxId60w|access-date=2020-12-29|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref>

A lot of his productions credits often fall into the [[Trap music]] sub-genre of hip-hop, commonly using 16th/8th note hi-hats with slight variation (such as rolls), hard-hitting kick drums, snares & booming 808 bass shots. He also explores more versatile instrumentation, tempos, production styles etc. such as with the likes of the more laid back and instrumental approach of songs such as singer Dominic Fike's "Phone Numbers" which contains a live guitar sample (performed by SNL lead guitarist Jared Scharff) <ref name="youtube.com"/> and a more acoustic feel, backed by a [[Virtual Studio Technology]] (VST) version of a real electric bass within Ableton Live that plays the bass line, provided via the [[Kontakt (sampler)]] VST - or a more experimental sound, found within his collaborative project with rapper Denzel Curry "Unlocked" which contains many spoken word samples scattered throughout the tracks and a more disjointed feel, provided by various creative implementations of obscure musical samples found throughout the project. His songs often begin with the producer tag "Whoa, Kenny!", which was originally said by the Atlanta rapper KEY!, who is a frequent collaborator of Kenny's.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/levels/kenny-beats-is-hip-hop-productions-prodigal-son/|title=Kenny Beats Is Hip-Hop Production's Prodigal Son|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=2019-07-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713141941/https://pitchfork.com/levels/kenny-beats-is-hip-hop-productions-prodigal-son/|archive-date=2019-07-13|url-status=live}}</ref>

He has often talked about the importance of being in person with an artist he is recording and producing for, stating how valuable it can be to have immediate feedback on ideas and enhance the overall creativity and music that is produced.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Denzel Curry and Kenny Beats Talk Making of ‘Unlocked’ and Quiz Each Other - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=181&v=aa45q2Ces7Y&feature=youtu.be|access-date=2020-12-29|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref>

== LOUDPVCK ==
{{Main|Loudpvck}}
In 2009, while attending Berklee College of Music, Kenny met Ryan Marks, a DJ. These two became friends, and in 2012, they decided to form the EDM duo [[Loudpvck]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Watson |first1=Elijah |title=Kenny Beats Wants To Be Rap's Quincy Jones [Interview] |url=https://www.okayplayer.com/originals/who-is-kenny-beats-rico-nasty-777.html |website=OkayPlayer |access-date=2020-01-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200112041250/https://www.okayplayer.com/originals/who-is-kenny-beats-rico-nasty-777.html |archive-date=2020-01-12 |url-status=live}}</ref> Marks ultimately left the group in 2017 while Kenny transitioned from being a EDM producer to a hip-hop producer.

== Social media presence ==

Kenny calls his studio "The Cave", and beginning in March 2019, Kenny launched a YouTube series of the same name called "The Cave", in which he invites artists to rap 16-32 bars over a custom beat he creates during the video.  Usually, the artists are people that he already has experience with, or, is already friends with.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/46394/1/kenny-beats-how-to-produce-a-legendary-rap-freestyle-interview|title=Kenny Beats’ guide to producing a legendary rap freestyle|last=Dazed|date=2019-10-21|website=Dazed|language=en|access-date=2019-12-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191213025000/https://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/46394/1/kenny-beats-how-to-produce-a-legendary-rap-freestyle-interview|archive-date=2019-12-13|url-status=live}}</ref>  They come in, tell him what kind of beat they want, and in 10 to 15 minutes, he'll have something ready that caters to that particular style. The Cave is known for showcasing not only these artists' lyricism, but their personalities. As of April 1, 2020, Kenny has uploaded 23 episodes and amassed just over 31 million views.  In addition to being his studio and the name of his YouTube series, "The Cave" is also the home to D.O.T.S. (Don't Over Think Shit), a creative group that assists artists with their artistic vision.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.umusicpub.com/us/Artists/K/Kenny-Beats.aspx|title=Kenny Beats|website=Universal Music Publishing Group|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191227212718/https://www.umusicpub.com/us/Artists/K/Kenny-Beats.aspx|archive-date=2019-12-27|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>
