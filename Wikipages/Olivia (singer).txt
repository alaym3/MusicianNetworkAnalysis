Her second studio album ''Behind Closed Doors'' was shelved, but leaked a year later on several mixtape websites.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Behind Closed Doors (the Album We Never Received) Mixtape by Olivia Hosted by DJ Tre'i Starzz, G-unit, DJ Whoo Kid|url=https://www.datpiff.com/Olivia-Behind-Closed-Doors-the-Album-We-Never-Received-mixtape.12960.html|access-date=2020-06-17|website=www.datpiff.com}}</ref> In 2009, Olivia did a feature for Congolese singer [[Fally Ipupa]] on his song "[[Chaise Électrique (Fally Ipupa song)|Chaise Électrique]]" which was on the top of the Congolese and African Hits.
