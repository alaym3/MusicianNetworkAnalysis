'''Cibo Matto''' ({{IPA-it|ˈtʃiːbo ˈmatto|pron}}, [[Italian language|Italian]] for "crazy food") was an American [[alternative rock]] band formed by [[Yuka Honda]] and [[Miho Hatori]] in [[New York City]] in 1994.<ref name="last.fm">{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Cibo+Matto |title=Cibo Matto – Free listening, concerts, stats, & pictures at |publisher=Last.fm |access-date=2013-10-21}}</ref> Initially, the band's lyrics were primarily concerned with food,<ref name="allmusic.com">{{cite web|first=Jason|last=Ankeny |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cibo-matto-mn0000121778/biography |title=Cibo Matto &#124; Biography |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=2013-10-21}}</ref> before expanding into broader subject matter following the addition of [[Sean Lennon]], [[Timo Ellis]], and Duma Love to the band for their [[Stereo Type A|second studio album]].<ref name="b&n">{{cite web|url=http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/interview.asp?CTR=208191|title=Barnes & Noble - Cibo Matto Interview|publisher=[[Barnes & Noble]]|access-date=October 1, 2011|archive-date=September 18, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918092232/http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/interview.asp?CTR=208191|url-status=dead}}</ref>

While Honda and Hatori are Japanese [[expatriate]]s,<ref name="last.fm"/> the group initially did not gain as large a following in Japan as it did in the United States. Their first album ''[[Viva! La Woman]]'' sold 40,000 copies in Japan, but was more successful in the U.S., with over 74,000 copies sold.<ref>Bell, Carrie.

The EP caught the attention of [[Warner Bros. Records]], which signed Cibo Matto later in the year. Through Warner Bros., the duo released its first major album, ''[[Viva! La Woman]]''.<ref name="allmusic.com"/> Cibo Matto is an [[Italian language|Italian]] phrase that translates to "Crazy Food" and many of the tracks from ''Viva! La Woman'', which was produced by Mitchell Froom, featured lyrics related to food, including "Know Your Chicken", "Apple", and "Birthday Cake".<ref name="allmusic.com"/> The album's first single, "Sugar Water", was a modest [[campus radio|college radio]] and dance hit. The song was accompanied by an innovative split screen [[music video]] that was directed by [[Michel Gondry]], where each side showed the same footage—one side going forward, and one backward, meeting mid-song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.splitscreen.us/2005/07/cibo_matto__sug.html |title=Split Screen - Cibo Matto—Sugar Water |publisher=Splitscreen.us |date=2005-07-04 |access-date=2013-10-21}}</ref> After the music videos for "Know Your Chicken" and "Sugar Water" enjoyed success on [[MTV]], Cibo Matto made appearances on various television shows such as [[Oddville, MTV|''Oddville'']], ''[[Viva Variety]]'', and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''.

Cibo Matto continued to play live and tour until disbanding in 2002.<ref name="last.fm"/> Honda said: "We felt the need to move to the next step.

==Grand Royal involvement==
Although Cibo Matto was represented by Warner Bros. Records, they were also considered to be a major part of the [[Grand Royal Records]] family.
* Under Grand Royal, Honda and Hatori formed side-project band [[Butter 08]] (1996) with Russell Simins, Rick Lee and [[Mike Mills (director)|Mike Mills]].
* Hatori collaborated with the [[Beastie Boys]] (who founded Grand Royal) on their 1997 album, ''[[Hello Nasty]]''.
* [[Sean Lennon]] released his debut album, ''[[Into the Sun (Sean Lennon album)|Into the Sun]]'' (1998) on Grand Royal (which featured Honda, Hatori and Ellis).
* Yumiko Ōno of [[Buffalo Daughter]] (a former Grand Royal band) contributed [[moog synthesizer]] and backing vocals to ''Stereo-Type A'' (1999).

* In 2002, despite Grand Royal's recent "official" disbandment, the Grand Royal team was bought onto to provide additional soundtrack work on ''[[Jet Set Radio Future]]''. A number of Grand Royal-associated acts were included on the soundtrack because of so, including Cibo Matto's "Birthday Cake".<ref>{{cite video game|title=Jet Set Radio Future|developer=[[Smilebit]]|publisher=[[Sega]]|date=February 25, 2002|platform=[[Xbox]]|level=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OX0VHT80Fk Credits]}}</ref>
