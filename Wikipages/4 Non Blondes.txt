(4 Non Blondes song)|What's Up?]]".<ref name="Larkin" />

Originally, the band was all-female, with lead singer [[Linda Perry]], bassist Christa Hillhouse, guitarist [[Shaunna Hall]], and drummer Wanda Day.<ref name="HS-Hunt">{{Cite news |last=Hunt |first=Dennis |date=September 30, 1993 |title=4 Non Blondes; Color them unpredictable |work=Hamilton Spectator}}</ref> However, along with Day being replaced by [[Dawn Richardson]] (drums), Hall was replaced by [[Roger Rocha]] (guitar) before the release of the album.

Lead singer Linda Perry left the band in 1994, and the remaining members disbanded shortly thereafter.<ref name="Advocate-Bono" />

==Formation and debut album==
Bassist Christa Hillhouse and guitarist Shaunna Hall had been roommates and met drummer Wanda Day when they joined a band she was playing in. When the three left that band, they started playing as a trio, but after seeing Perry sing at a solo performance, Hillhouse and Hall asked her to join as vocalist.  

According to Perry, she and Hall were at Nightbreak, a San Francisco club, and when it was mentioned the trio was looking for a vocalist, Perry announced she was a singer, to which Hall replied, "I know". Their first rehearsal was supposed to be at 6:10 pm on October 17, 1989, but shortly after 5:00 pm the [[Loma Prieta earthquake]] hit the San Francisco area.<ref name="flipside">{{Cite news |last=Indiana |first=Gary |date=July–August 1991 |title=4 Non Blondes Interview |work=[[Flipside (fanzine)|Flipside]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=October 30, 1989 |last1=Griggs |first1=Lee |last2=Wyss |first2=Dennis |last3=Reingold |first3=Edwin M. |last4=Willwerth |first4=James |title=Earthquake |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,958883-1,00.html |url-status=dead |access-date=November 13, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224084935/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C958883-1%2C00.html |archive-date=December 24, 2008}}</ref>

The unusual name of the band came from an experience the group had in the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] with a blonde family. According to Christa Hillhouse, "Right next to us, there's a trash receptacle with a piece of pizza on top and the kid wanted to pick it up. The mom said, 'No, it's probably dirty, what with the pigeons and people.' And she stared right at us. We were Non Blondes."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Martin |first=Louise |date=September 24, 1993 |title=Mane of the game is success |work=The Age}}</ref>

The experience and the name became a symbol that they didn't fit the California stereotype.

They got their start in the San Francisco bar scene, especially lesbian bars, gaining a significant lesbian following.<ref name="Advocate-Bono">{{Cite magazine |last=Bono |first=Chastity |date=September 15, 1995 |title=Linda Perry: The lesbian singer of 4 Non Blondes goes solo with a bold and honest album |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hmQEAAAAMBAJ&q=Linda+Perry%3A+The+lesbian+singer+of+4+Non+Blondes+goes+solo+with+a+bold+and+honest+album&pg=PA37 |magazine=The Advocate |volume=609 |pages=37–40}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Walters |first=Barry |date=September 17, 1996 |title=Nonblonde ambition |magazine=The Advocate |volume=716 |pages=81–82 |issn=0001-8996}}</ref> In July 1991, the band was signed to [[Interscope Records|Interscope]]<ref name="HS-Hunt" /> following a performance at the [[Gavin Report|Gavin Convention]], where they opened for [[Primus (band)|Primus]] on Valentine's Day of the same year. As they began pre-production for their debut album, Day was fired and replaced by Dawn Richardson. In 1992, while recording ''[[Bigger, Better, Faster, More!]]'' the album's producer, [[David Tickle]], felt that Hall's guitar playing was "not happening" so she was let go from the band as well.<ref name="understood">{{Cite news |last=Chun |first=Kimberly |title=Noise: Miss understood |work=[[San Francisco Bay Guardian]] |url=http://www.sfbg.com/40/01/noise_miss_understood.html |url-status=dead |access-date=November 13, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028192212/http://www.sfbg.com/40/01/noise_miss_understood.html |archive-date=October 28, 2012}}</ref> 

Guitarist Louis Metoyer finished the record. The album and its song "[[What's Up? (4 Non Blondes song)|What's Up?]]" was released as the album's second single in 1993. It was successful in the United States<ref name="guitarcenter">{{Cite web |title=Linda Perry interview |url=http://gc.guitarcenter.com/interview/linda-perry/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303235058/http://gc.guitarcenter.com/interview/linda-perry/ |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |access-date=February 12, 2012 |website=[[Guitar Center]]}}</ref> and in several European countries, peaking at number one in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland.

[[Roger Rocha]] joined after completion of the album and stayed with the band until 1994. 

Openly lesbian lead singer Perry often performed with a prominent "dyke" sticker affixed to her guitar, including at the [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Awards]] in 1993<ref>{{Cite magazine |last1=Portwood |first1=Jerry |last2=Freeman |first2=Jon |last3=Brittany |first3=Spanos |last4=Suzy |first4=Exposito |last5=Lambe |first5=Stacy |last6=Camp |first6=Zoe |last7=Borton |first7=Marcus |last8=Shorey |first8=Eric |date=June 1, 2019 |title=Music's Unsung LGBTQ Heroes |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/musics-unsung-lgbtq-heroes-629374/ |access-date=August 24, 2021 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |language=en-US}}</ref> and on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Williams |first=Carla |date=October 15, 2004 |title=Music Video |url=http://www.glbtq.com/arts/music_video.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324165354/http://www.glbtq.com/arts/music_video.html |archive-date=March 24, 2007 |url-status=live |access-date=March 10, 2020 |website=glbtq: An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture}}</ref> 

4 Non Blondes contributed the song "[[Wayne's World 2 (soundtrack)|Mary's House]]" to the film ''[[Wayne's World 2]]'' in 1993.<ref name="BB-Triumph">{{Cite magazine |date=December 11, 1993 |title=4 Non Blondes Triumph Following A 'Shaky' Start |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> They also covered [[Van Halen]]'s "I'm the One" on the soundtrack for ''[[Airheads]]''.

==Disbanding==
The group disbanded in late 1994 during the recording of their second album. Perry has said that she had been unhappy with ''Bigger, Better, Faster, More!''<ref name="Advocate-Bono" /> She has also explained that her sexuality had a part to play in her tensions with the group. Perry was an out lesbian, but band members Hillhouse and Richardson were less comfortable being as open about their sexuality in the early 1990s.<ref name="BB-Halperin" />   

Perry went solo in 1995. She has released solo work, and produced and written songs on albums by [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Alicia Keys]], [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], [[Gwen Stefani]], [[Courtney Love]] and [[Kelly Osbourne]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=De La O |first=Maria |date=October 1, 2011 |title=What's up with Linda Perry: The lesbian rock legend shares her heartbreak with a new album |work=Curve}}</ref> 

Hall has recorded, produced, composed for and performed with various artists, including vocalist [[Storm Large]] (1999–2001), guitarist [[Eric McFadden]] (1995–2001) and funk pioneer [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] & [[Parliament Funkadelic]] and released "Electrofunkadelica: e3+FUNKnth = music for the body, mind & soul", a self-produced project in 2006 on Make Music, Not War! Records.

After leaving the Blondes in 1991, Day continued drumming with Malibu Barbi,<ref name="loud">{{Cite web |last=Hall |first=Shaunna |title=Life and Times of Wanda Day |url=http://loudithfaire.net/celebskin/shaunna_wandaday.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216141733/http://loudithfaire.net/celebskin/shaunna_wandaday.html |archive-date=December 16, 2008 |access-date=November 24, 2008 |website=Loudith Faire}}</ref> and then Bad Dog Play Dead. In late 1992, an accident crushed her legs and broke her back, which made drumming very painful.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} She moved out of San Francisco in 1995, spent some time in Arizona and eventually went back to Salt Lake City.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Day died on July 10, 1997,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Death: Wanda Marie Day |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/572565/Death--Wanda-Marie-Day.html?pg=all |access-date=April 30, 2014 |website=[[Deseret News]]|date = July 13, 1997}}</ref><ref name="understood" /> and is buried in [[Tropic, Utah]].

Perry and Hillhouse reunited in 1999 in support of Perry's solo tour.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Christa |first=Hillhouse |title=Linda Perry Tour 1999 |url=http://chillhousemedia.com/chillBlog/linda-perry-tour-1999/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424173813/http://chillhousemedia.com/chillBlog/linda-perry-tour-1999/ |archive-date=April 24, 2017 |access-date=April 24, 2017 |website=Chillhouse Music}}</ref> 

On May 11, 2014, the group reunited to perform a concert at a fundraiser entitled "An Evening For Women: Celebrating Arts, Music and Equality" which was held at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles. Perry produces the annual event for the L.A. Gay & Lesbian Center to raise money for the center. According to Perry, "the majority of the money goes to the youth center program, which is basically kids that get thrown out on the street by their own parents for being gay."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Jess |date=March 31, 2011 |title=Linda Perry Starts Pink's Party, Defends Christina Aguilera, Is Legendary |url=https://www.autostraddle.com/linda-perry-autostraddle-interview-830128/ |access-date=March 16, 2020 |website=Autostraddle}}</ref>
