His debut studio album, ''[[A Written Testimony]]'' was released in 2020 and followed up by ''[[Act II: The Patents of Nobility (The Turn)]]'' after years of speculation and delay.

==Early life==
Inspired by [[LL Cool J]], Jay Electronica began rapping at the age of 10. He grew up in the [[Magnolia Projects]] in [[New Orleans]] and attended the all-boys parochial high school [[St. Augustine High School (New Orleans)|St. Augustine High School]].

Electronica left New Orleans as a young adult in the late 1990s with the intention of moving to [[New York City]] but took a stop in [[Atlanta]]. Electronica was struck by "all the now hiring signs because of the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Olympics]]." In Atlanta, he accepted the teachings of [[Elijah Muhammad]] via the [[Five-Percent Nation]] before moving on to becoming a registered member of the [[Nation of Islam]] at its headquarters in [[Chicago]].

==Musical career==
In 2007, Jay Electronica released his first mixtape, ''[[Act I: Eternal Sunshine (The Pledge)]]'', via MySpace. It was downloaded over 50,000 times.<ref name="Boombox">{{Cite web|url=https://theboombox.com/revisiting-jay-electronica-act-one-the-pledge/|title=REVISITING… JAY ELECTRONICA'S 'ACT I: THE PLEDGE'|author=Sweeney Kovar|date=October 10, 2013|access-date=March 22, 2020|website=The Boombox}}</ref> That success and his catalog led to Electronica joining the [[Rock the Bells]] Tour in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Tribe Called Quest, Nas, Pharcyde Lead Rock the Bells 2008 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/a-tribe-called-quest-nas-pharcyde-lead-rock-the-bells-2008-89516/ |publisher=Rolling Stone |access-date=March 12, 2020}}</ref>

Later that year, producer [[Just Blaze]] and Jay Electronica selected songs for Guitar Center's GAIN project, Fresh Cuts Vol. 3 and included a (previously unnamed) song  which Just Blaze named "Exhibit A (Transformations)."<ref>{{cite web |title=Guitar Center Helps Employees Release Their Music with Fresh Cuts Vol. 3 Compilation CD |url=https://www.guitarplayer.com/.amp/miscellaneous/guitar-center-helps-employees-release-their-music-with-fresh-cuts-vol-3-compilation-cd |website=Guitar Player |access-date=March 12, 2020 }}{{Dead link|date=March 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

[[Just Blaze]] would later (October 27, 2009) debut [[Exhibit C]] on Tony Touch's Sirius Radio program,<ref>{{cite web |title=Just Blaze debuts Jay Electronica's "Exhibit C" and more on Toca Tuesday (Updated w/ lyrics) |url=http://www.missinfo.tv/index.php/just-blaze-debuts-jay-electronicas-exhibit-c-and-more-on-toca-tuesday/ |publisher=Miss Info |access-date=March 12, 2020}}</ref> where it quickly caught on, making its way to terrestrial radio stations like New York's Hot 97 and spawning artist remixes from MCs [[AZ (rapper)|AZ]], [[N.O.R.E]], [[Saigon (rapper)|Saigon]], [[Joell Ortiz]] and others.

A bidding war ensued with Jay finally signing (November 12, 2010) with [[Roc Nation]]. Though fans and critics anticipated a full-length debut, Electronica's output in the subsequent decade consisted of several collaborations and non-album solo songs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/03/your-guide-to-the-mythology-of-jay-electronica.html|title=Your Guide to the Extended Mythology of Jay Electronica, Rap's Great Mystery|last=Thompson|first=Paul|date=March 13, 2020|website=Vulture|language=en-us|access-date=March 27, 2020}}</ref>
