'''Primus''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[El Sobrante, California]] in 1984. The band is currently composed of bassist/vocalist [[Les Claypool]], guitarist [[Larry LaLonde|Larry "Ler" LaLonde]], and drummer [[Tim Alexander|Tim "Herb" Alexander]]. Primus originally formed in 1984 with Claypool and guitarist [[Todd Huth]], later joined by drummer [[Jay Lane]], though the latter two departed the band at the end of 1988. Featuring LaLonde and Alexander, Primus recorded the live album ''[[Suck on This]]'' in 1989, followed by four studio albums: ''[[Frizzle Fry]]'' (1990), ''[[Sailing the Seas of Cheese]]'' (1991), ''[[Pork Soda]]'' (1993), and ''[[Tales from the Punchbowl]]'' (1995). Alexander left the band in 1996 due to lack of interest <ref>{{Cite web|last=Young|first=Alex|date=July 4, 2016|title=Primus drummer Tim 'Herb' Alexander suffers heart attack|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2016/07/primus-drummer-tim-herb-alexander-suffers-heart-attack/|access-date=June 15, 2020|website=Consequence of Sound|language=en-US}}</ref> and was replaced by [[Bryan Mantia|Bryan "Brain" Mantia]], with whom Primus went on to record the original theme song for the TV show ''[[South Park]]'' and two more albums, ''[[Brown Album]]'' (1997) and ''[[Antipop]]'' (1999), before going on hiatus in 2000.

In 2003, Claypool and LaLonde reunited with Alexander and released an EP and accompanying DVD, ''[[Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People]]'', before touring sporadically through 2008. In 2010, Lane rejoined Primus, replacing Alexander who had again left the band, and the band released their seventh album, ''[[Green Naugahyde]]'', in 2011. In 2013, Lane left the band to focus on other projects, and Alexander rejoined once again. They have released some of their records on Claypool's own label [[Prawn Song Records]].
Primus is characterized by its irreverent, quirky approach to music. In 1993, [[Robert Christgau]] remarked: "[Primus is] quite possibly the strangest [[Billboard 200|top-10]] band ever, and good for them."<ref name="Christgau review">{{cite web|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Primus|title=CG: Primus|publisher=[[Robert Christgau]]}}</ref>

The duo initially had trouble finding a drummer, until Claypool's friend Vince "Perm" Parker returned home from a stint in the army, and together the three of them recorded their first demo, financed by Claypool selling his car.<ref name="bass player 1992">{{cite web|title=Les Claypool gets a Taste of the Big Time|publisher=[[Bass Player (magazine)|Bass Player]]|website=ram.org|first=Karl|last=Coryat|author-link=Karl Coryat|date=September 1992|url=http://www.ram.org/music/primus/articles/bp1.html|access-date=September 23, 2006}}</ref><ref name="through the years">{{cite web|url=http://mama.indstate.edu/users/primus/html/primus_through_the_years.html|title=Primus Through the Years: Les Claypool Reflects on His Past|author=Michael Goldberg|work=[[Addicted to Noise]]|access-date=May 1, 2011}}</ref> Primate changed their name to Primus after "about a month" when they were approached by a group called the Primates threatening legal action over the similarity of their names.<ref name="through the years" /> Parker was soon replaced by the band's second drummer, Peter Libby, who played on their first demo as Primus. After 2–3 years with the band he was himself replaced by Robbie Bean,  Tim "Curveball" Wright had the drum chair for 6 months in 1988.<ref name="family tree">{{cite web|title=Primus family tree|url=http://www.ram.org/music/primus/misc/family_tree.html|access-date=April 29, 2011}}</ref> After rising to fame in the local music scene with their brand of funk metal fusion, reaching the point where they were "selling out [[Berkeley Square (club)|Berkeley Square]]", Wright was fired from Primus in the summer of 1988 to be replaced by [[Jay Lane]], drummer with the [[Freaky Executives]], who were "getting dicked around by their record company", as Claypool later described it.<ref name="through the years" />

At the end of 1988, after recording another demo, titled ''Sausage'', Lane left Primus when "something good happened" with the Freaky Executives' record deal.<ref name="through the years" /> Huth also soon left the band, expressing a desire to dedicate more time to his family.<ref name="through the years" /> In 1987, Primus was put on hold briefly and Claypool rejoined his former band, [[Blind Illusion]], who at the time also featured one-time [[Joe Satriani]] student and ex-[[Possessed (band)|Possessed]] guitarist [[Larry LaLonde|Larry "Ler" LaLonde]].<ref name="birthday">{{cite web|url=http://www.ram.org/music/primus/articles/les_bday_atn.html|title=You Say It's Your Birthday: Les Claypool of Primus|work=Addicted to Noise, via ram.org|author=Randy Reiss|date=September 1997|access-date=May 1, 2011}}</ref> Claypool recruited LaLonde to reform Primus together with [[Tim Alexander|Tim "Herb" Alexander]], drummer with the [[Arizona]]-based group [[Major Lingo]], and a month later,<ref name="through the years"/><ref name="RoSto Naugahyde"/> the trio recorded their first album: ''[[Suck on This]]'' (1989), a live recording culled from two of their Berkeley concerts, funded by a loan from Claypool's father.<ref name="animals discog">Illustrated Discography, ''[[Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People]]'' DVD, 2003.</ref> [[Bryan Mantia|Bryan "Brain" Mantia]] (who later joined the band in 1996) was briefly a member of the band during this time period, before a broken foot forced him to leave the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brian-brain-mantia-mn0000517342/biography|title=Brian "Brain" Mantia - Biography & History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=January 15, 2018}}</ref>

In 1990, the band released their first studio album, ''[[Frizzle Fry]]'', and released singles for "[[John the Fisherman]]" and "[[Too Many Puppies]]". With a music video featuring [[Kirk Hammett]], a studio album and a tour with [[Jane's Addiction]], Primus' popularity grew to the point where they attracted attention from [[Interscope Records]], who signed them in 1990.

===''Seas of Cheese'', ''Pork Soda'', and ''Tales from the Punchbowl'' (1991–1996)===
Primus's major label debut was the album ''[[Sailing the Seas of Cheese]]''. The album was supported by the singles "[[Jerry Was a Race Car Driver]]" and "[[Tommy the Cat]]", both of which appeared on MTV. A third single, "[[Those Damned Blue Collar Tweekers|Those Damned Blue-Collar Tweekers]]", was also released but did not feature a video. The band appeared as contestants for the [[Battle of the Bands]] in ''[[Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey]]'' and made music for a [[Beavis and Butt-Head]] tribute album with a song entitled "Poetry and Prose". With a major label behind them, ''Sailing the Seas of Cheese'' went gold. The band then toured in support of [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[U2]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], and [[Fishbone]].

After the release of ''Sailing the Seas of Cheese'', in 1992, Primus released a [[cover song]] [[EP (format)|EP]] ''[[Miscellaneous Debris]]'', with their version of [[XTC]]'s "Making Plans for Nigel" receiving enough airplay to reach No.&nbsp;30 on [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s Modern Rock Tracks chart.<ref>
{{cite magazine|title=Primus Chart History, Singles|magazine=Billboard|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=primus|chart=all}}|access-date=April 1, 2007}}</ref>

In 1993, Primus released ''[[Pork Soda]]'', which managed to debut at No.&nbsp;7 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The album was darker than previous Primus efforts, dealing with murder, suicide, and alienation. The band has commented that prior to recording, they had been touring for nearly two solid years and were thus in a sombre mood. "[[My Name Is Mud]]" was the first single, reaching No.&nbsp;9 on the U.S. [[Alternative Songs]] chart.  "[[DMV (song)|DMV]]" and "[[Mr. Krinkle]]" followed, the latter made into a video featuring Claypool in a pig suit and tuxedo playing upright bass in an abandoned warehouse as a carnival of oddities parades behind him, including Claypool's wife and her twin sister. Claypool said he put his "heart and soul" into the video, but it received next to no airtime on MTV. In an interview with ''[[Guitar World]]'' magazine, Claypool disparaged the channel's unwillingness to air the video, saying "it got played like six times."

''Pork Soda'' was recorded at the band's rehearsal space in San Rafael. The band would subsequently record all of their albums at Claypool's home studio called [[Rancho Relaxo]] (a [[The Simpsons|Simpsons]] TV show reference).

In 1993, Primus headlined the [[alternative rock]] festival [[Lollapalooza]]. They also made an appearance at the [[Woodstock '94]] Music Festival. They were pelted with mud while they performed "My Name Is Mud".<ref>[https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6221688/exclusive-primus-les-claypool-talks-woodstock-94-20-years-later Primus' Les Claypool Talks Woodstock '94, 20 Years Later] billboard.com</ref> About a minute into the song the band stopped playing, and Claypool said, "Well I opened a big-ass can of worms with that one, didn't I? The song is called 'My Name Is Mud', but keep the mud to yourselves you son-of-a-bitch."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jambase.com/article/full-show-friday-primus-at-woodstock-1994|title=Full Show Friday &#124; Primus At Woodstock 1994|date=August 8, 2014|website=JamBase}}</ref>

During a lull in 1994, the early Primus lineup of Claypool, Huth, and Lane reunited to record ''[[Riddles Are Abound Tonight]]'' under the band name [[Sausage (band)|Sausage]], named after the demo they had recorded together in 1988. Among the songs they recorded is an early version of "The Toys Go Winding Down", retitled "Toyz 1988". The video for the title track "Riddles Are Abound Tonight" featured the band in blue leotards performing on stationary bicycles.

In 1995, Primus released their fourth album, ''[[Tales from the Punchbowl]]''. It contained Primus's most successful single to date, which is the Grammy-nominated "[[Wynona's Big Brown Beaver]]". The song was accompanied by a video with the band members dressed up in cartoonish plastic cowboy costumes (similar to the suits worn in the [[The Puttermans|then-current Duracell battery commercials]]). The band was invited to perform on the [[Late Show with David Letterman]] and [[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]. On the David Letterman show, Primus appeared dressed in penguin tuxedos. Two other less successful singles, "[[Mrs. Blaileen]]" and "[[Southbound Pachyderm]]" (the latter of which featured a claymation video that received only minimal airplay on MTV) were also released.

In 1996, Claypool self-produced his first solo album entitled ''Les Claypool and the Holy Mackerel Presents [[Highball with the Devil]]''. On this album many of the songs are done solely by Claypool himself. Claypool also employs the help of a number of other musicians. Experimental Bay Area guitarist [[M.I.R.V.]] joined Claypool and others. Performances include a spoken word piece from [[Henry Rollins]] on the song "Delicate Tendrils". This album was recorded at Rancho Relaxo.

===''Brown Album'', ''Antipop'', and hiatus (1997–2002)===
[[File:Primus copenhagen 1998.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Claypool, Mantia and LaLonde in 1998]]
Alexander left the band and was replaced by [[Bryan Mantia|Bryan "Brain" Mantia]] of Limbomaniacs and [[Praxis (band)|Praxis]]. Claypool stated "Herb's departure was like a marriage that just slowly decayed to an end."<ref>[http://www.ram.org/music/primus/articles/BAMinter.html Interview with Primus taken from BAM magazine, July 11, 1997.] Retrieved October 22, 2012.</ref> With Mantia aboard, Primus were asked in 1996 to compose the theme song to ''[[South Park]]''. Primus also later contributed to the ''[[Chef Aid: The South Park Album|Chef Aid]]'' album with the song "Mephisto and Kevin".

''[[Brown Album]]'' was released in 1997 and supported by the singles "Shake Hands with Beef" and "Over the Falls". In 1998, the band headlined the inaugural [[Sno-Core]] tour with [[the Aquabats]], [[Long Beach Dub Allstars]] and [[Blink-182]].

In late 1998, Primus released the ''[[Rhinoplasty (EP)|Rhinoplasty]]'' EP, which features covers of acts like [[XTC]], [[the Police]] and [[Peter Gabriel]]. The EP also includes two live recordings of Primus, as well as bonus content accessed through a [[CD-ROM]] portion of the CD. It was shortly followed by the video release ''[[Videoplasty]]''.

''[[Antipop]]'' was released in 1999, and featured production and guest appearances from [[James Hetfield]] of [[Metallica]], [[Tom Morello]] of [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[Matt Stone]], one of the creators of ''South Park'', [[Stewart Copeland]] of The Police, [[Jim Martin (musician)|Jim Martin]] of [[Faith no more]], and [[Fred Durst]] of [[Limp Bizkit]]. While producing the song "[[Lacquer Head]]", Durst encouraged Primus to return to the more aggressive sound of their earlier albums for ''Antipop''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Devenish |first1=Colin |title=Limp Bizkit |year=2000 |publisher=St. Martin's |isbn=0-312-26349-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/limpbizkit0000deve/page/159 159–60] |url=https://archive.org/details/limpbizkit0000deve/page/159 }}</ref> Some critics compared the album's murky downtuned guitars to [[nu metal]], which was popular during the time.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.spin.com/reviews/primus-green-naugahyde-prawn-songato|title=Primus, 'Green Naugahyde'|first=Christopher|last=Schultz|magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|access-date=November 24, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/reviews/primus-emgreen-naugahydeem|title=CD Review: PRIMUS Green Naugahyde|first=Jeremy|last=Uley|work=Metal Injection|access-date=November 24, 2012}}</ref> The band toured in support of ''Antipop'' at [[Ozzfest]] and on the [[Family Values Tour]]. The band released a music video for the album's only single, "Lacquer Head", which was banned from MTV because of references to and depictions of drug use, despite the song's anti-drug message. Tensions among the band rose considerably during this period, Claypool stated "there was some doubt at the label as to whether we knew what the hell we were doing anymore."<ref>{{cite AV media notes | others=Primus | title=[[They Can't All Be Zingers]]| year=2006 |publisher=[[Interscope Records]]}}</ref>

In 2000, Primus performed a cover of [[Black Sabbath]]{{'}}s song "[[N.I.B.]]" featuring vocals by [[Ozzy Osbourne]]. The track originally appeared on the album ''[[Nativity in Black|Nativity in Black II: A Tribute to Black Sabbath]]''. The track was also released as part of Osbourne's 2005 ''Prince of Darkness'' box set.

The band went on hiatus from 2000 to 2003, with Claypool later stating: <blockquote>"The end of the Nineties was an unhappy Primus camp. I hit a creative stagnation that wasn't helping us forward, and the personal elements, it just was time to stop. And I had been asked for many years, "How long can Primus go on?" And I always said, "I'll do it until it's not fun anymore." And it just wasn't fun anymore on many different levels."<ref name="RoSto Naugahyde"/></blockquote>

During this hiatus, Alexander released two albums with the band Laundry and performed with [[Blue Man Group]], [[A Perfect Circle]], and Born Naked, among others. Claypool explored the jam band scene with [[Oysterhead]] (featuring friend [[Trey Anastasio]] of [[Phish]] and [[Stewart Copeland]] of [[the Police]]) and his own [[Colonel Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade]] (featuring both Huth and Lane). He also collaborated with Brain, [[Buckethead]] and [[Bernie Worrell]] in the group [[Colonel Claypool's Bucket of Bernie Brains]].

===Reformation (2003–2009)===
[[File:PrimusLiveInOttawaJuly062008.JPG|thumb|left|Alexander, Claypool and LaLonde at the 2008 [[Ottawa Bluesfest]]]]
In late 2003, Primus reunited with Alexander on drums to record a five track EP. Released alongside a DVD containing the band's music videos and clips from live performances, the resulting package was titled ''[[Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People]]''. The band staged a two-month tour performing two sets per show, the second consisting of their 1991 release ''[[Sailing the Seas of Cheese]]'' in its entirety. 2004 saw them continue touring, this time performing their 1990 release ''Frizzle Fry'' in its entirety. For these two tours, the band sold recordings directly recorded from the sound-board online. The performance in Chicago was videotaped and released as a DVD titled ''[[Hallucino-Genetics|Hallucino-Genetics: Live 2004]]''.  They also performed a set at Bonnarroo in 2004, a late night set featuring a cover of "YYZ" by Rush and a guest appearance by [[Adrian Belew]] on "Thela Hun Ginjeet" a King Crimson cover.

In 2005, the band performed at [[Lollapalooza]] and [[Vegoose]]. Between Primus shows, Claypool created a new solo project called [[Les Claypool's Fancy Band]] which, like other projects, occasionally used Primus songs.

A May 10, 2006 article on [[IGN]] revealed that Primus had signed on with [[RedOctane]] to allow the [[master recording]] of [[John the Fisherman]] to be used in [[Guitar Hero II]], a game for the [[PlayStation 2]] and {{nowrap|[[Xbox 360]]}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/707/707004p1.html|title=E3 2006: Rock Out with Primus on Guitar Hero II|author=Kathleen Sanders}}</ref>

Primus performed on July 29, 2006, at the first annual [[Hedgpeth Festival]] in Twin Lakes, Wisconsin.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Roberts|first=Lee|date=July 20, 2006|title=Hedgpeth: Home to Country Thunder festival opens its doors to indie and alternative bands - and their fans|url=https://journaltimes.com/hedgpeth-home-to-country-thunder-festival-opens-its-doors-to-indie-and-alternative-bands-/article_c04eb1df-0005-5451-86c6-61544332c6b9.html|access-date=June 15, 2020|website=Journal Times|language=en}}</ref>

On October 17, 2006, Primus released both their first greatest hits CD ''[[They Can't All Be Zingers]]'', as well as their third DVD ''[[Blame It on the Fish]]: an Abstract Look at the 2003 Primus Tour de Fromage''. Containing live footage from the band's 2003 Tour de Fromage, interview segments and behind the scenes footage, the DVD includes a 70-minute feature film and 90 minutes of bonus material, including a 30-minute [[mockumentary]] about the band in the year 2065. ''Blame it on the Fish'' was directed by Matthew J. Powers. ''They Can't All Be Zingers: The Best of Primus'' includes 16 digitally remastered songs that span the band's career.

In November 2006, Primus commenced another tour <!--"Beat a Dead Horse" never caught on--> which concluded the following month. They played at a few festivals in 2008, including the [[Rothbury Festival]] (in Michigan), the Ottawa Blues Fest, the [[Quebec City Summer Festival]], and the Outside Lands Festival (in San Francisco). On November 24, 2009, Prawn Song re-released the band's first studio album, ''Frizzle Fry'', on [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]], along with some of Claypool's solo albums.

It was revealed in 2011 that Alexander lacked interest in continuing Primus, despite enthusiasm from LaLonde and Claypool.<ref name="RoSto Naugahyde"/> Claypool hinted that the band could have recorded with Alexander, but that "when we did readdress Primus in '03 and '06, it was more of a nostalgic thing. It was great at the time, but it just didn't have that creative spark as far as moving forward",<ref name="RoSto Naugahyde"/> and thus the reformation instead focused on touring.

===''Green Naugahyde'' (2010–2013)===
On March 18, 2010, it was announced by [[Phil Lesh]] on his official message board that former Primus drummer Lane would be leaving his previous band [[Furthur (band)|Furthur]] to rejoin Primus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philzone.org/ |title=Phil Lesh, Furthur, Grateful Dead Phan Forum |publisher=Philzone.org |access-date=October 22, 2011}}</ref> On May 3, 2010, Primus announced a new tour with [[Gogol Bordello]], [[Wolfmother]], and [[Critters Buggin#Critters Buggin Trio (2006)|the Dead Kenny G's]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/denver/articles/primus-announces-headlining-tour-new-album,40715|title=Primus announces headlining tour, new album|author=Tuyet Nguyen}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crittersbuggin.com/01live.html |title=Critters Buggin official website |publisher=Crittersbuggin.com |access-date=October 22, 2011}}</ref> The press release for the tour revealed that the band were looking to "refine their chops before heading into the studio to record their first album of brand new music since 1999's ''Antipop''."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spinner.com/2010/05/03/primus-returns-tour-new-album|title=Primus Returns to the Road, Plans New Album|publisher=Spinner.com|access-date=April 11, 2014}}</ref> Correlating with this announcement, the Primus website was updated with an animation of an elevator with its twelfth floor featuring a stylized question mark, and a sign reading "Primus will be with you shortly", alluding to future plans. In 2011, Claypool elaborated on the band's decision to record an album, stating that "(Lane) coming back has just breathed life back into the project.

On August 5, 2010, Primus released ''[[June 2010 Rehearsal]]'', a free four-track rehearsal EP available for download on their official website. The EP consists of new recordings of previously released Primus songs featuring Lane on drums.

Primus began their second annual Oddity Faire tour on September 14, 2010, with opening acts [[Portugal. The Man]], [[Split Lip Rayfield]], [[Mariachi El Bronx]], [[the New Orleans Bingo! Show]], [[Mucca Pazza]] and [[Gogol Bordello]].  The Squidling Brothers Circus Sideshow performers also entertained the crowd between bands on select dates. To promote this tour, Primus appeared on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' in September. The Oddity Faire tour did not include dates in Primus's hometown, the San Francisco Bay Area, because for promotional purposes it was too near to the planned New Year's dates December 30 and 31 in Oakland.<ref>Aidin Vaziri [http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-07-18/entertainment/21987233_1_primus-les-claypool-musical Pop Quiz: Les Claypool of Primus] {{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} ''[[sfgate.com]]'' July 18, 2010</ref>

The band performed their first set in front of the iconic ''Suck On This'' backdrop seen in the "[[Too Many Puppies]]" music video. For their second set, Primus were joined by "the [[Colonel Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade|Frog Brigade]] Ensemble", consisting of saxophonist [[Skerik]] and percussionist [[Mike Dillon (musician)|Mike Dillon]], as they performed the soundtrack from the 1971 film ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'' in its entirety.

At the beginning of 2020, the band announced that they would be doing a tour in which every night they would cover [[Rush (band)|Rush]]'s 1977 album ''[[A Farewell to Kings]]'' in its entirety. The tour was postponed twice. Once due to the fact that Primus joined Slayer on their retirement tour and again due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. In November 2020, they announced a livestream entitled "Alive From Pachyderm Station" that would air on December 11 at Primuslive.com if audience bought a ticket. The concert was filmed at Claypool's winery, "Claypool Cellars". The event marked the first time in 20 years that songs from ''Antipop'' were performed live, including the first official performance of the song (other than being played at soundcheck in Milwaukee in 1999) "Eclectic Electric". The "Tribute to Kings" tour commenced in August 2021 and will wrap up in October.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/primus-announces-rescheduled-dates-for-a-tribute-to-kings-tour-performing-rushs-a-farewell-to-kings-in-its-entirety/|title=PRIMUS Announces Rescheduled Dates For 'A Tribute To Kings' Tour Performing RUSH's 'A Farewell To Kings' In Its Entirety|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=April 27, 2021|access-date=August 17, 2021}}</ref>

Primus is also known for their unique live performances that feature extended solos and improvisation. Many of their songs have been upgraded significantly with changed lyrics, added solos, and general alterations in musical composition. Claypool often plays the [[whamola]] during drum solos.
