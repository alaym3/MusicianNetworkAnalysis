==Early life==
[[File:Mohammed Rafi's family tree.jpg|thumb|Rafi's family tree.]]
Mohammed Rafi was the second eldest of six brothers born to Haji Ali Mohammad. The family originally belonged to [[Kotla Sultan Singh]], a village near present-day [[Majitha]] in [[Amritsar district]] of [[Punjab, India]].<ref name="tribuneindia_striking">{{cite web | url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060223/aplus.htm#1 | title=Striking the right chord| author=Varinder Walia | publisher=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]: Amritsar Plus | date=16 June 2003 | access-date=28 April 2007}}</ref> Rafi, whose nickname was ''Pheeko'', began singing by imitating the chants of a [[fakir]] who roamed the streets of his native village [[Kotla Sultan Singh]] where his family lived. Rafi's father moved to [[Lahore]] in 1935, where he ran a men's hair cutting saloon - in Noor Mohalla in [[Bhati Gate]].<ref>[http://www.culturalindia.net/indian-music/indian-singers/rafi.html Mohammed Rafi Biography – Facts, Life History & Achievements]. Culturalindia.net. Retrieved 6 November 2018.</ref>
Rafi learnt [[Indian Classical Music|classical music]] from [[Ustad Abdul Wahid Khan]], Pandit Jiwan Lal Mattoo and Firoze Nizami.<ref name="tribuneindia_sang_for_kishore">{{cite web | url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020923/login/music.htm|title=When Rafi sang for Kishore Kumar|author= Amit Puri | work=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]] | date=23 September 2002}}</ref> His first public performance came at the age of 13, when he sang in Lahore [[Pakistan]] featuring [[K. L. Saigal]]. In 1941, Rafi made his debut in Lahore as a playback singer in the duet "Soniye Nee, Heeriye Nee" with Zeenat Begum in the [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] film ''Gul Baloch'' (released in 1944) under music director Shyam Sunder.<ref name="tribune_his_voice">{{cite web | url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040725/spectrum/main7.htm | title=His voice made him immortal | author=M.L.

He made his [[Hindi cinema|Hindi film]] debut in ''Gaon Ki Gori'' in 1945.<ref name="EBIndia2"/>

== Early career in Mumbai (then Bombay) ==
Rafi moved to [[Mumbai|Bombay]] (now Mumbai), [[Maharashtra]] in 1944. He and Hameed Sahab rented a ten-by-ten-feet room in the crowded downtown Bhendi Bazar area. Poet Tanvir Naqvi introduced him to film producers including [[Abdur Rashid Kardar]], [[Mehboob Khan]] and actor-director Nazeer.<ref name="dailytimes">{{cite web | url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_16-6-2003_pg3_6 | title=The Way It Was: Tryst With Bollywood | author=Syed Abid Ali | publisher=Daily Times, Pakistan | date=16 June 2003 | access-date=28 April 2007}}</ref> Shyam Sunder was in Bombay and provided the opportunity to Rafi to sing a duet with [[G. M. Durrani]], "Aji dil ho kaabu mein to dildar ki aisi taisi...," for ''Gaon Ki Gori'', which became Rafi's first recorded song in a Hindi film. Other songs followed.

Rafi's first song with [[Naushad]] was "Hindustan Ke Hum Hain" with Shyam Kumar, Alauddin and others, from A. R. Kardar's ''Pehle Aap'' (1944). Around the same time, Rafi recorded another song for the 1945 film ''Gaon Ki Gori'', "Aji Dil Ho Kaaboo Mein". He considered this song to be his first Hindi language song.<ref name="sangeetmahal_hall_of_fame"/>

Rafi appeared in two movies. He appeared on the screen for the songs "Tera Jalwa Jis Ne Dekha" in film ''Laila Majnu''(1945) and "Woh Apni Yaad Dilane Ko" in the Film ''Jugnu'' (1947).<ref name="sangeetmahal_hall_of_fame"/> He sang a number of songs for Naushad as part of the chorus, including "Mere Sapnon Ki Rani, Roohi Roohi" with [[K. L. Saigal]], from the film ''Shahjahan'' (1946). Rafi sang "Tera Khilona Toota Balak" from Mehboob Khan's ''Anmol Ghadi'' (1946) and a duet with [[Noor Jehan]] in the 1947 film ''Jugnu'', "Yahan Badla Wafa Ka". After partition, Rafi decided to stay back in India and had the rest of his family flown to [[Mumbai|Bombay]]. Noor Jehan migrated to [[Pakistan]] and made a pair with playback singer [[Ahmed Rushdi]].

In 1949, Rafi was given solo songs by music directors such as Naushad (''Chandni Raat'', ''Dillagi'' and ''Dulari''), Shyam Sunder (''Bazaar'') and Husnalal Bhagatram (''Meena Bazaar'').

Besides K. L. Saigal, whom he considered his favorite, Rafi was also influenced by G. M. Durrani. In the early phase of his career, he often followed Durrani's style of singing, but later evolved his own, unique style. He sang with Durrani in some of the songs such as "Humko Hanste Dekh Zamana Jalta Hai" and "Khabar Kisi Ko Nahiin, Woh Kidhar Dekhte" (''Beqasoor'', 1950).

In 1948, after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, the team of Husanlal Bhagatram-Rajendra Krishan-Rafi had overnight created the song "Suno Suno Ae Duniyawalon, Bapuji Ki Amar Kahani". He was invited by the Indian Prime Minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], to sing at his house. In 1948, Rafi received a silver medal from Jawaharlal Nehru on Indian Independence Day.<ref>{{cite book |author=Sujata Dev |title=Mohammed Rafi Voice of a Nation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=noAyCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT268 |date=1 October 2015 |publisher=Om Books International |isbn=978-93-80070-97-1 |page=268 }}</ref>

Rafi's association with Naushad helped the former establish himself as one of the most prominent playback singers in Hindi cinema.<ref name="sangeetmahal_hall_of_fame"/> Songs from ''[[Baiju Bawra (1952 film)|Baiju Bawra]]'' (1952) like "O duniya ke rakhwale" and "Man tarpat hari darshan ko aaj" furthered Rafi's credentials.<ref name="tribune_his_voice"/> Rafi ended up singing a total of 149 songs (81 of them solo) for Naushad. Before Rafi, Naushad's favorite singer was [[Talat Mahmood]]. Once Naushad found Talat smoking during a recording.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stories.motivateme.in/amazing-story-when-naushad-found-talat-mahmood-smoking-during-a-recording-and-got-irritated/|title=Amazing Story – And got irritated {{!}} MotivateMe.in – Stories|last=admin|website=stories.motivateme.in|access-date=6 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cineplot.com/talat-naushad/|title=Talat Mahmood – Naushad Collaboration|website=cineplot.com|access-date=6 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i0jvCwAAQBAJ&q=Naushad+found+Talat+smoking+during&pg=PA4|title=Remembering Mohammed Rafi|last=Poolakkal|first=Vijay|date=10 March 2014|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781329501775|language=en}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}} He was annoyed and hired Rafi to sing all the songs of the movie ''Baiju Bawra''.

===Work with O. P. Nayyar===
Rafi and [[O. P. Nayyar]] (OP) created music in the 1950s and 1960s. O. P. Nayyar was once quoted as saying "If there had been no Mohd. Rafi, there would have been no O. P. Nayyar".<ref name="Rafi001">{{cite web

Rafi and OP had a falling-out during the recording for movie "Sawan ki Ghata". As disclosed by OP during one of his interviews; Rafi reported late to the recording stating that he was stuck in [[Shankar Jaikishan]]'s recording.

===Work with Laxmikant-Pyarelal===
The composer duo [[Laxmikant–Pyarelal]] (L-P) patronized Rafi as one of their singers, right from their very first song by him from the film ''[[Parasmani]]'' (1963). Rafi and L-P won the [[Filmfare Award]] for the song "Chaahoonga Mein Tujhe Saanjh Suvere" from ''[[Dosti]]'' (1964). Rafi rendered the highest number of songs for this music director duo Laxmikant-Pyarelal, as compared to all the music directors: 388.<ref name="how_fair_raju1"/>

Once, when composer [[Nisar Bazmi]] (who had migrated to [[Pakistan]]) didn't have enough money to pay him, Rafi charged a fee of one rupee and sang for him. He also helped producers financially. As Laxmikant (of the Laxmikant-Pyarelal duo) once observed – "He always gave without thinking of the returns".

=== Work with Kalyanji Anandji ===
Kalyanji Anandji composed around 170 songs in the voice of Rafi. Kalyanji's relationship with Rafi started with the 1958 film, ''Samrat Chandragupta'', his debut film as a solo composer.<ref name="google1">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=noAyCwAAQBAJ&q=kalyanji+anandji+rafi+association&pg=PT94|title=Mohammed Rafi Voice of a Nation|last=Dev|first=Sujata|date=1 October 2015|publisher=Om Books International|isbn=9789380070971|language=en}}</ref> Kalyani-Anandji and Rafi went on to work together for the music of the [[Shashi Kapoor]]-starrer ''Haseena Maan Jayegi'' (1968), which featured songs like "Bekhudi Mein Sanam" and "Chale The Saath Milke".<ref name="google1"/>

===Work with contemporary singers===
Rafi associated with several of his contemporaries, singing duets with them and sometimes for them (as in case of Kishore Kumar who was also an actor).
Rafi sang the highest number of duets with [[Asha Bhonsle]] (female), [[Manna Dey]] (male) and [[Lata Mangeshkar]] (female).

In the song "Humko Tumse Ho Gaya Hai Pyaar Kya Karein" (''[[Amar Akbar Anthony]]''), Rafi sang one song with Kishore Kumar, Lata Mangeshkar, and Mukesh, the most legendary singers in [[Bollywood]]. This was probably the only time that all of them rendered their voices for one song.<ref name="zeenews_soulful">[http://www.zeenews.com/news459223.html Mohammed Rafi: The soulful voice lives on!]. Zee News. 31 July 2008.</ref>

=== Work with other music directors ===
Rafi sang frequently for all music directors during his lifetime, including Roshan, Jaidev, Khayyam, Rajesh Roshan, Ravindra Jain, Bappi Lahiri, Sapan Jagmohan etc. He had a special and major association with [[Usha Khanna]], [[Sonik Omi]], [[Chitragupta (composer)|Chitragupta]], [[S. N. Tripathi|S.N. Tripathi]], [[N. Datta]] and [[R. D. Burman|R.D. Burman]]. He also sang for many small time and lesser-known music directors. Many for whom he sang for free while making their compositions immortal. As he selflessly believed in financially assisting producers and helping small-time projects who could not afford much. Many in the industry received regular financial help from Rafi.<ref name="google2">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=noAyCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT232|title=Mohammed Rafi Voice of a Nation|last=Dev|first=Sujata|date=1 October 2015|publisher=Om Books International|isbn=9789380070971|language=en}}</ref>

===Private albums===
Rafi sang several songs in [[Chris Perry (musician)|Chris Perry]]'s [[Konkani]] album Golden Hits with [[Lorna Cordeiro]]. He recorded many private albums in various genres and languages. Rafi recorded Hindi songs in English on 7" release in 1968. He also sang 2 songs in [[Creole language|Creole]] while on his visit to [[Mauritius]] in the late 1960s.

===Royalty issue===
In 1962–1963, the popular female playback singer [[Lata Mangeshkar]] raised the issue of playback singers' share in the [[royalties]]. Recognizing Rafi's position as the leading male playback singer, she wanted him to back her in demanding a half-share from the 5% song royalty that the film's producer conceded to select composers. Rafi refused to side with her, stating that his claim on the film producer's money ended with his being paid his agreed fee for the song. Rafi argued that the producer takes financial risk and the composer creates the song, so the singer does not have any claim over the royalty money. Lata viewed his stand as a stumbling block on the royalty issue and stated that it is because of the singer's name also that the records get sold. This difference of opinion subsequently led to differences between the two. During the recording of "Tasveer Teri Dil Mein" (''Maya'', 1961), Lata argued with Rafi over a certain passage of the song. Rafi felt belittled, as music director [[Salil Chowdhury]] sided with Lata. The situation worsened when Lata declared that she would no longer sing with Rafi. Rafi stated that he was only so keen to sing with Lata as she was with him.<ref name="how_fair_raju3">{{cite web

In the early '70s, Rafi suffered a major setback, when Kishore Kumar emerged as the main Bollywood playback singer, with [[Aradhana (1969 film)|Aradhana]].

He could recover some of the lost ground in 1977, but the main songs of the period were by Kishore Kumar.

Some of Rafi's hit songs of the early 1970s were with music directors: [[Laxmikant–Pyarelal]], [[Madan Mohan (composer)|Madan Mohan]], [[R. D. Burman]] and [[S. D. Burman]]. These include "Tum Mujhe Yun Bhula Naa Paoge" (a signature song of 1971), from ''[[Pagla Kahin Ka]]''; "Yeh Duniya Yeh Mehfil" from ''[[Heer Ranjha (1970 film)|Heer Ranjha]]'' (1970); "Kaan Mein Jhumka" from ''[[Sawan Bhadon]]''; "Jhilmil Sitaron Ka" from ''[[Jeevan Mrityu]]'' (1970); "Gulabi Aankhen" from ''[[The Train (1970 film)|The Train]]'' (1970); "Yun Hi Tum Mujhse Baat" from ''[[Sachaa Jhutha]]''; "Yeh Jo Chilmun Hei" and "Itna To Yaad Hei Mujhe" from ''[[Mehboob Ki Mehndi]]'' (1971); "Mera Man Tera Pyaasa" '' from ''[[Gambler (1971 film)|Gambler]]''; "Chadhti Jawani" and "Kitna Pyara Vada" from ''[[Caravan (1971 film)|Caravan]]'' (1971); "Chalo Dildaar Chalo" from ''[[Pakeezah]]'' (1972); "Chura Liya Hai Tumne" from ''[[Yaadon Ki Baaraat]]'' (1973); "Na Tu Zumeen Ke Liye" from [[Dilip Kumar]]'s movie ''[[Dastaan (1972 film)|Dastaan]]'' (1972); "Tum Jo Mil Gaye Ho" from ''[[Hanste Zakhm]]'' (1973); "Tere Bindiya Re", from ''[[Abhimaan (1973 film)|Abhimaan]]'' (1973) and "Aaj Mausam Bada Beimaan Hai" from ''[[Loafer (1973 film)|Loafer]]'' (1973).

==Later years==
Rafi made a comeback as the leading singer in mid 1970s. In 1974 he won the Film World magazine Best Singer Award for the song "Teri Galiyon Mein Na Rakhenge Kadam Aaj Ke Baad" ([[Hawas]], 1974) composed by [[Usha Khanna]].<ref name="how_fair_raju1"/>

In 1976, Rafi sang all the songs for [[Rishi Kapoor]] in the hit film ''[[Laila Majnu (1976 film)|Laila Majnu]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1050729/asp/etc/story_5037312.asp|title=Forever velvet |work=The Telegraph |location=Calcutta |access-date=11 December 2017}}</ref> Rafi went on to sing many more songs for Rishi Kapoor in the subsequent hit films, including ''[[Hum Kisise Kum Naheen]]'' (1977) and ''[[Amar Akbar Anthony]]'' (1977).<ref>{{cite book |author=Sujata Dev |title=Mohammed Rafi: Voice Of A Nation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=noAyCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT71 |year=2015 |publisher=Om Books |isbn=978-93-80070-97-1 |pages=71–72}}</ref> In 1977, he won both Filmfare Award and the National Award for the song "Kya Hua Tera Wada" from the movie ''[[Hum Kisise Kum Naheen]]'', composed by [[R.

Rafi sang for many successful films in the late 1970s and the early 1980s many of whose hit songs were dominating the charts in the late 70s on radio programs such as ''Vividh Bharati, Binaca Geetmala and Radio Ceylon.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1050729/asp/etc/story_5037312.asp|title=The Telegraph – Calcutta : etc|website=The Telegraph|location=Kolkota|access-date=23 December 2017}}</ref> Some of these include ''[[Pratigya (1975 film)|Pratiggya]]'' (1975), ''[[Bairaag]]'' (1976), ''[[Amaanat]]'' (1977), ''[[Dharam Veer (film)|Dharam Veer]]'' (1977), ''[[Apnapan]]'' (1977), ''[[Ganga Ki Saugand]]'' (1978), ''[[Suhaag (1979 film)|Suhaag]]'' (1979), ''[[Sargam (1979 film)|Sargam]]'' (1979), ''[[Qurbani (1980 film)|Qurbani]]'' (1980), ''[[Dostana (1980 film)|Dostana]]'' (1980), ''[[Karz (film)|Karz]]'' (1980), ''[[The Burning Train]]'' (1980), ''[[Abdullah (film)|Abdullah]]'' (1980), ''[[Shaan (1980 film)|Shaan]]'' (1980), ''[[Aasha (1980 film)|Aasha]]'' (1980), ''[[Aap To Aise Na The]]'' (1980), ''[[Naseeb (1981 film)|Naseeb]]'' (1981) and ''[[Zamane Ko Dikhana Hai|Zamaane Ko Dikhana Hai]]'' (1981). In 1978, Rafi gave a performance at the Royal Albert Hall and in 1980 he performed at the Wembley conference centre. From 1970 until his death he toured around the world extensively giving concert performances to packed halls.

In December 1979, Rafi recorded six songs for the Hindi remake of Dilip Sen's Bengali superhit ''Sorry Madam''; the film was never completed due to a personal tragedy in Dilip Sen's life. These songs, written by Kafeel Aazar and composed by Chitragupta, were released digitally in December 2009 by the label Silk Road under the title "The Last Songs".<ref>{{cite web|title = Mohammed Rafi : "The Last Songs" – Silk Road Communications – Music Label & Sound Design|url = http://www.silkrd.com/catalogue/mohamed-rafi-the-last-songs|website = silkrd.com|access-date = 25 December 2015|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151226063830/http://www.silkrd.com/catalogue/mohamed-rafi-the-last-songs|archive-date = 26 December 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref> The physical album was released only in India by Universal.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Guinness World Records controversy===
During his last years, Rafi was involved in a controversy over Lata Mangeshkar's entry in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]]. In a letter dated 11 June 1977 to the Guinness Book of World Records, Rafi had challenged the claim that Lata Mangeshkar has recorded the highest number of songs ("not less than 25,000" according to Guinness). Rafi, according to his fans, would have sung more songs than Lata – he being the senior of the two. They estimated the number of songs sung by Rafi to be anything from 25,000 to 26,000. This prompted Rafi to write a letter, in protest, to Guinness.<ref name="dnaindia.com">{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-book-extract-mohammed-rafi-golden-voice-of-the-silver-screen-2161626|title=Book extract: Mohammed Rafi – Golden Voice of the Silver Screen {{!}} Latest News & Updates at Daily News & Analysis|date=3 January 2016|work=dna|access-date=11 December 2017}}</ref> After receiving a reply from Guinness, in a letter dated 20 November 1979, he wrote, "I am disappointed that my request for a reassessment vis-a-vis Ms Mangeshkar's reported world record has gone unheeded."<ref name="zeenews_soulful"/> In an interview to BBC recorded in November 1977, Rafi claimed to have sung 25,000 to 26,000 songs till then.<ref name="Rafi001"/>

After Rafi's death, in its 1984 edition, the&nbsp;Guinness Book of World Records gave Lata Mangeshkar's name for the "Most Recordings" and stated, "Mohammad Rafi (d 1 August 1980) [sic] claimed to have recorded 28,000 songs in 11 Indian languages between 1944 and April 1980."<ref name="how_fair_raju7">{{cite web | url=http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2006/aug/23sld7.htm | title=How fair were they to Mohammed Rafi?: Page 7 | author=Raju Bharatan | work=[[Rediff.com]] | date=23 August 2006 | access-date=28 April 2007}}</ref> The Guinness Book entries for both Rafi and Lata were eventually deleted in 1991.
