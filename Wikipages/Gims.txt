== Early life ==
Gandhi Djuna was born on 6 May 1986 in [[Kinshasa]], [[Zaire]] (Now the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 1997). He comes from a family of musicians: his father Djanana Djuna is the singer of [[Papa Wemba]]'s [[Viva La Musica]] troupe. He arrived in France in 1988 at the age of two, with his parents who were then foreigners in an irregular situation.

Because of his parents hiding, he explains having had a difficult childhood. He was placed with foster families, before living in squats until he was 18 years old. This passage from his life is mentioned in his book ''Vise le soleil''. He is part of a family of fourteen children. He is the brother of [[Dadju]], member of the group [[Shin Sekaï|The Shin Sekaï]], of Bedjik, Afi (formerly Xgangs) and Djelass all three rappers.<ref>{{Cite web|date=18 April 2013|title=Maître Gims invite ses frères Dadju, Bedjik et X-Gangs sur Subliminal ?! • RAPRNB|url=https://prod.raprnb.com/2013/04/18/maitre-gims-invite-ses-freres-dadju-bedjik-et-x-gangs-sur-subliminal/|access-date=1 August 2021|website=RAPRNB|language=fr-FR}}</ref> On his first album [[Subliminal (album)|''Subliminal'']] (2013), they participate in the song "Outsider".<ref>{{Cite web|title=lescharts.com – Les charts français|url=https://lescharts.com/search.asp?todo=notfound|access-date=1 August 2021|website=lescharts.com}}</ref> Gims grew up in the [[3rd arrondissement of Paris]]. His family then moved to the [[9th arrondissement of Paris|9th arrondissement]] and finally to the [[19th arrondissement]]. Gims studied graphic design and communication.<ref>{{Cite web|title=meltygroup|url=https://www.meltygroup.com/|access-date=1 August 2021|website=www.meltygroup.com|language=fr-FR}}</ref>

He takes the nickname "Gims" in reference to Asian cinema and the world of martial arts.

== Career ==

=== Sexion d'Assaut (2002–2012) ===
In 2002, Gims formed with the rappers [[Sexion d'Assaut|JR O Crom]] and Makan the trio Prototype 3015. The name of the group was chosen in reference to a film, mainly for its "combative" meaning. The name [[Sexion d'Assaut]] also includes a reference to the [[Sturmabteilung]] (SA), in French "Section d'Assaut", a famous [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] paramilitary unit, which the group learns by chance during a concert for the City of Paris.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Match|first=Paris|title=Sexion d’assaut, les doux agneaux du rap|url=https://www.parismatch.com/Culture/Musique/Sexion-d-assaut-les-doux-agneaux-du-rap-158244|access-date=1 August 2021|website=parismatch.com|language=fr}}</ref> In 2005, the trio merged with Assonance, another group from the Sexion d'Assaut collective. The group is now called 3rd Prototype.

After a few pieces produced independently, Sexion d'Assault meets their agent, Dawala, in the cellars of [[Châtelet–Les Halles|Châtelet-Les Halles]] in Paris. With Dawala, the 3rd Prototype released its first mixtape, ''La Terre du Milieu'', on 13 May 2006. Gims designed the CD cover. In 2007, they released the album ''Le Renouveau'', which contained the well-known piece "Anti Tectonick".

Through Prototype 3015 first, then Prototype 3, Gims is part of the [[Sexion d'Assaut]] supergroup. Sexion d'Assaut released his first songs between 2002 and 2003. Among them, we find Gang yaba Gang, Coup 2 pression and Frères de rue. With Sexion d'Assault, Gims participates twice in the ''12 Inch'All Star'', a famous rap competition in the Parisian underground which takes place at the [[Le Batofar|Batofar]]. He came in second place and gained notoriety, now known as one of the best kickers (freestylers) in France.
[[File:Gims.tiff|thumb|Gims in concert with [[Sexion d'Assaut]] at [[Cléon]] on 22 February 2010.]]
In 2008, the group presented monthly freestyles called Les Chroniques du mois: each month, at least two freestyle songs were released via audio or video. In January 2009, Sexion d'Assaut published a net-tape renamed ''[[Les Chroniques du 75]]'', a compilation also containing previously unreleased tracks, including the solo piece "À 30%" by Gims.

Sexion d'Assaut's second street album, ''[[L'Écrasement de tête]]'', was released in May 2009 on Because Music.<ref>{{Cite web|title=lescharts.com – Les charts français – L'Écrasement de tête|url=https://lescharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Sexion+d%27Assaut&titel=L%27%E9crasement+de+t%EAte&cat=a|url-status=live|access-date=19 August 2021|website=lescharts.com}}</ref> The last sub-entity of the supergroup, 3rd Prototype, disappears completely. ''LÉcrasement de tête'' acquired a certain notoriety with the general public thanks to titles and music videos, including "T'es bête ou quoi?" and "Wati Bon Son" (in collaboration with [[Dry (rapper)|Dry]]). Sexion d'Assaut goes on tour, notably opening for [[Orelsan]] and [[Medina]]. The Head Crush sells more than 50,000 copies. Following the release of ''LÉcrasement de tête'', the group left Because Music due to misunderstandings and signed with [[Sony Music]] Entertainment.

In 2010, Sexion d'Assaut released the studio album ''[[L'École des points vitaux]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=lescharts.com – Les charts français – L'École des points vitau|url=https://lescharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Sexion+d%27Assaut&titel=L%27%E9cole+des+points+vitaux&cat=a|url-status=live|access-date=19 August 2021|website=lescharts.com}}</ref> Gims is credited there as a singer-songwriter. He composed the instrumental tracks of several pieces, including "Ils appellent ça "Casquette à l'envers". Other beatmakers also participate in the album, such as SoulChildren with "La drogue te donne des ailes". The album met with great success with the general public, selling over 400,000 copies. The group opens for [[Suprême NTM]] at the Parc des Princes and performs at the [[Zénith Paris|Zénith de Paris]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Piermay|first=Floriane|date=16 June 2010|title=Sexion d’Assaut au Parc des Princes avec NTM samedi|url=https://www.melty.fr/sexion-d-assaut-au-parc-des-princes-avec-actu35624.html|access-date=1 August 2021|website=melty|language=fr-FR}}</ref>

In April 2011, a controversy broke out over the group's openly homophobic claims. In reaction to criticism, [[Sexion d'Assaut]] decided to release a mixtape entitled ''[[En attendant L'Apogée: les Chroniques du 75]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|title=lescharts.com – Les charts français – En attendant L'Apogée: les Chroniques du 75|url=https://lescharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Sexion+d%27Assaut&titel=En+attendant+l%27apog%E9e+%2D+Les+chroniques+du+75&cat=a|url-status=live|access-date=19 August 2021|website=lescharts.com}}</ref> which despite everything met with success with titles like "Paris va bien" and "Qui t'a dit". The project contains a DVD including one of the clips of the songs present, as well as a documentary retracing the group's journey.

In March 2012, they released their second album, ''[[L'Apogée]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|title=lescharts.com – Les charts français – L'Apogée|url=https://lescharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Sexion+d%27Assaut&titel=L%27apog%E9e&cat=a|url-status=live|access-date=19 August 2021|website=lescharts.com}}</ref> which was more successful than the first. The album sold over 700,000 copies. The same year, Gims published an online comic entitled ''Au cœur du vortex''.

In parallel with his career with Sexion d'Assaut, Gims tried his hand at musical composition. At the end of 2006, he released his first solo project, an [[Extended play]] entitled ''[[Pour ceux qui dorment les yeux ouverts]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Pour ceux qui dorment les yeux ouverts (EP) – Maître Gims|url=https://www.senscritique.com/album/Pour_ceux_qui_dorment_les_yeux_ouverts_EP/19730383|access-date=14 August 2021|website=www.senscritique.com}}</ref> The EP is produced by ATK's Fredy K and Noko.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Album "Pour Ceux Qui Dorment Les Yeux Ouverts" par Maître Gims⋆ Musique Urbaine|url=https://www.musiqueurbaine.fr/album/dorment-yeux-ouverts/|access-date=14 August 2021|website=Musique Urbaine|language=fr-FR}}</ref> Pressed to very few copies, the disc aims to make Gims known to the general public.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Check out Maître Gims on TuneIn|url=https://tunein.com/album/Pour-ceux-qui-dorment-les-yeux-ouverts-d1369804/|access-date=14 August 2021|website=TuneIn|language=en-us}}</ref> The record features tracks with [[Sexion d'Assaut]], [[Scred Connexion]] rapper Koma and a singer named Carole.<ref>{{Citation|title=Maitre Gims – Pour Ceux Qui Dorment Les Yeux Ouverts (2006, CD)|url=https://www.discogs.com/Maitre-Gims-Pour-Ceux-Qui-Dorment-Les-Yeux-Ouverts/release/3038450|language=fr|access-date=14 August 2021}}</ref>

In September 2013, he participated in the single "[[Game Over (Vitaa song)|Game Over]]" by singer [[Vitaa]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Vitaa dévoile "Un son pour des millions", nouvel extrait de l'album "Ici et maintenant"|url=http://www.chartsinfrance.net/Vitaa/news-89003.html|access-date=31 July 2021|website=chartsinfrance.net}}</ref> The song ranks first in sales of singles in France.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Top Singles : Vitaa détrône Bakermat, Lady Gaga débarque dans le top 10|url=http://www.chartsinfrance.net/actualite/news-88879.html|access-date=31 July 2021|website=chartsinfrance.net}}</ref> On 22 November 2013, Gims unveils his new clip "Changer", which ranks 17th for the week of 1 December 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|title=MEILLEURS CLIPS VIDÉOS, SEMAINE DU 1 DÉCEMBRE 2013|url=http://www.topclip.fr/classement-hebdomadaire/2013-48|access-date=31 July 2021|website=www.topclip.fr}}</ref> With this ballad, Gims hopes to reach a new, wider audience.

Although announced for the month of March, the release of the first single from the album "[[Est-ce que tu m'aimes?]]" took place on 28 April on Skyrock. In addition, he announces that the album will be divided into two parts: the Blue Pill which is a part made up of urban pop songs, and the Red Pill which is oriented towards [[Rapping|rap]]. This concept was inspired by the movie ''[[The Matrix]]''. Some time later, the first single from The Red Pill titled "Melynda Gates" followed by a clip is released.

Then, Gims unveils the second extract of the Blue Pill called "[[Laissez passer (song)|Laissez passer]]", the clip of which brings together his family, his father and his brothers.

When the rapper shouts to the audience "Shall we continue?" ", The spectators shout" No! ". Interviewed in Morocco, Gims reveals that he did not hear the whistles when he sang and that these violent criticisms did not shock him.

== Personal life ==
Gandhi Djuna married two women: a Frenchwoman married in 2003 who lives in Morocco, and with whom he had two children, from whom he is separated but would never have divorced; then a Frenchwoman of Malian origin Demdem, married in 2005 and with whom he has 3 children.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Maître Gims : privé de nationalité française car marié à deux femmes ?|url=https://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2018/04/03/2772583-maitre-gims-prive-nationalite-francaise-car-marie-deux-femmes.html|access-date=31 July 2021|website=ladepeche.fr|language=fr}}</ref> He spends his time between France and Morocco.<ref>{{Citation|title=Maître Gims & Vianney : INTERVIEW " Laurent Delahousse " + duo & selfie en direct !.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPTI46DneWU|language=en|access-date=31 July 2021}}</ref>

=== Monstre Marin Corporation ===
{{Main|Monstre Marin Corporation}}
In 2013, Gims founded [[Monstre Marin Corporation]] with Pascal Nègre. The latter announces the direct integration of MMC into Universal.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Maître Gims : le rappeur crée son propre label|url=http://www.non-stop-people.com/actu/musique/maitre-gims-le-rappeur-cree-son-propre-label-50207|access-date=3 August 2021|website=Non Stop People|language=fr}}</ref> "Gims is one of the most gifted artists of his generation!

In February 2014, [[L'Algérino]] joined the label, followed in June 2014 by [[Mac Tyer]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Generations|date=24 June 2014|title=Generations|url=https://generations.fr/news/coulisse/28039/mac-tyer-rejoint-le-label-monstre-marin-corporation|access-date=3 August 2021|website=Generations|language=fr-FR}}</ref> [[Monstre Marin Corporation]] published its first compilation ''La Monster Party chapitre 1'' on 30 June 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Squat|title=Maitre Gims présente la compilation Monstre Marin Corporation|url=https://www.13or-du-hiphop.fr/2014/04/17/maitre-gims-presente-compilation-monstre-marin-corporation/|access-date=3 August 2021|website=13OR-du-HipHop|language=fr-FR}}</ref> According to [[BFM TV]], Gims sold 50% of the label Monstre Marin Corporation in 2014 for 500,000 euros. This structure sold to [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music France]] brought together many artists such as [[Vitaa]], [[Souf (singer)|Souf]], [[Mac Tyer]], [[L'Algérino]], MA2X, [[Lartiste]] or even the Marin Monster duo,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Urban Fusions|url=https://www.urban-fusions.fr/|access-date=3 August 2021|website=Urban Fusions|language=fr-FR}}</ref> now all gone and replaced by emerging artists like [[DJ Arafat]], DJ Last One, Amalya or Savana blues.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Maître Gims signe le rappeur Lartiste sur son label !|url=https://www.public.fr/News/Maitre-Gims-signe-Lartiste-sur-son-label-827471|access-date=3 August 2021|website=Public.fr|language=fr}}</ref> The label ends its activities on 13 January 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title=MONSTRE MARIN CORPORATION (PARIS 5) Chiffre d'affaires, résultat, bilans sur SOCIETE.COM – 795004084|url=https://www.societe.com/societe/monstre-marin-corporation-795004084.html|access-date=3 August 2021|website=www.societe.com}}</ref>

== Artistic environment ==
Gims' music is influenced by [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] and dance, with pop and Latin touches. Just before his first album, Les Inrocks compares Gims to footballer [[Lionel Messi]] for his versatility: "Gims has a vast arsenal. He sings, raps, composes and produces."<ref>{{Cite web|title="Subliminal" de Maître Gims est l'album du week-end|url=http://www.chartsinfrance.net/Maitre-Gims/news-86015.html|access-date=31 July 2021|website=chartsinfrance.net}}</ref> For his first album, the artist addresses his joys, his questions, his anger and his rants. In September 2013, he told Liberation that "he is not forbidding himself anything. A rock or even varietal album 'does not scare him'.
[[File:Gims et moi.jpg|thumb|Gims with a fan in 11 October 2013|268x268px]]
The second album is divided into two parts: an "urban pop / [[Rhythm and blues|RnB]]" oriented, widely broadcast by radio and music channels, and a "[[Rapping|rap]]" oriented as it did when it started. The humorist of the web Jhon Rachid deplores that the second part "old-fashioned rap" is less known than the first, which hurts him "rap" (title of his show on YouTube). As for [[Joeystarr]], he often criticizes him on social networks, calling his music "music for prepubescent". The slammer Grand Corps Malade said in an interview that he does not adhere to the music of Gims, which is "teenage pop" with "poor lyrics and an unpleasant voice".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Pour Grand Corps Malade, Maître Gims c'est "des textes assez pauvres, une voix désagréable"|url=https://www.lci.fr/musique/pour-grand-corps-malade-maitre-gims-cest-des-textes-assez-pauvres-une-voix-desagreable-1512822.html|access-date=31 July 2021|website=LCI|language=fr}}</ref>

The Booska-P site evokes "Gims-bashing" in an article presenting the most hated French rappers which also include [[Bigflo & Oli]], [[Jul (rapper)|Jul]] and [[Booba]]. Rap "purists" like [[Joeystarr]] or Jhon Rachid cited above reproach him for the touches of pop and dance; some calling his music "camping music" or "[[zumba]]". Hated by a part of the rap fans, he is also hated by a part of the general public who do not like rap and prefer variety or rock. Part of the press considers Gims as an artist of the subculture with very weak texts, like the literary critic [[Éric Naulleau]] declaring that Gims made "the worst texts of French song".

=== Influences ===
He cites artists such as [[Nate Dogg]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[50 Cent]], [[Eminem]] or even Tandem as his main influences.

== Controversies ==
In April 2017, he would have canceled a concert in [[Alès]] for lack of a private jet to take him there; the organizer does not have the means to pay for it. The titles denounce a "star whim". Following the media coverage, he gave a free and improvised concert in the [[Paris Métro|Paris metro]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=VIDÉO – Polémique sur un jet privé : Maître Gims donne un concert sauvage à Châtelet et s’explique sur TPMP|url=https://www.lci.fr/faits-divers/video-polemique-sur-un-jet-prive-maitre-gims-donne-un-concert-sauvage-a-chatelet-et-s-explique-chez-hanouna-sur-tpmp-2050128.html|access-date=31 July 2021|website=LCI|language=fr}}</ref> In the program ''[[Touche pas à mon poste !]]'', he explains that the concert was initially only a proposal which was ultimately not accepted. However, the promoter had already started selling the tickets. Faced with the risk of financial loss, the promoter contacted the rapper's producer and offered to come by private jet. Gims tells him that even with a private jet, he cannot get to Alès because he has another concert scheduled.

=== Plagiarism ===
Gims and [[Vianney (singer)|Vianney]] are accused of [[plagiarism]] by the Belgian director [[Charlotte Abramow]] for the clip "[[La même]]". On the occasion of the International Women's Day of 8 March 2018, she had broadcast a production of a clip called ''Les Passantes'' by [[Georges Brassens]] with which that of "[[La même]]", according to her, had many similarities. She thus declares: "[this clip takes again] the same structure, the same esthetics, the same decorations in pastel colors and especially the same types of portraits".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Maître Gims et Vianney accusés de plagiat|url=https://www.cnews.fr/people/2018-05-26/maitre-gims-et-vianney-accuses-de-plagiat-782829|access-date=31 July 2021|website=CNEWS|language=fr}}</ref>

According to [[RTBF International|RTBF]], YouTube decides to censor Charlotte Abramow's clip because of "potentially offensive sequences" linked in particular to the bodies of too naked women. After an indignation of users on social networks, the video host lifts the censorship and broadcasts the clip again.<ref>{{Cite web|date=22 May 2018|title=Maître Gims aurait-il copié le clip de l'artiste belge Charlotte Abramow?|url=https://www.rtbf.be/info/medias/detail_maitre-gims-aurait-il-copier-le-clip-de-l-artiste-belge-charlotte-abramow?id=9924552|access-date=31 July 2021|website=RTBF Info|language=fr}}</ref> Maitre Gims responds by accusing Charlotte Abramow of having herself violated copyright by using a clip from the music video for the song "[[Silent All These Years]]" by [[Tori Amos]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Generations|date=25 May 2018|title=Generations|url=https://generations.fr/news/coulisse/44788/maitre-gims-reagit-a-l-accusion-de-plagiat|access-date=31 July 2021|website=Generations|language=fr-FR}}</ref> The song "[[La même]]" was the title most broadcast by French radio stations in 2018, totaling more than 75,000 airings, while the clip is the second in the ranking on TV according to the research company Yacast.<ref>{{Cite web|date=17 January 2019|title="La même" de Maître Gims et Vianney, chanson la plus diffusée en 2018|url=https://www.francetvinfo.fr/culture/musique/chanson-francaise/la-meme-de-maitre-gims-et-vianney-chanson-la-plus-diffusee-en-2018_3389505.html|access-date=31 July 2021|website=Franceinfo|language=fr-FR}}</ref>

[[File:Vortex VX.jpg|thumb|143x143px|Vortex VX logo.]]
At the beginning of 2013, Gims founded his own clothing brand, Vortex Vx, sold in particular at [[Veepee]] and Gémo. On 31 October 2018, the [[manga]] ''Devil's Relics'' was published, imagined by Gims with his brother Darcy, and co-signed by the two brothers with screenwriter [[Jean-David Morvan]] and designer Yoshiyasu Tamura.<ref>{{Cite news|date=31 October 2018|title=« Devil’s Relics », l’intrigante incursion de Maître Gims dans le manga|language=fr|work=Le Monde.fr|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2018/10/31/devil-s-relics-l-intrigante-incursion-de-maitre-gims-dans-le-manga_5377257_4408996.html|access-date=19 August 2021}}</ref>

=== Lyricist ===
In addition to writing his own texts, he also writes for other artists. In 2013, Gims participated as a "guest" in the [[Popstars (French TV series)|Popstars]] program, in which he gave young groups advice for their career. Following this intervention, he will write the first single of the winning group, [[The Mess]], entitled Au Top. This single will reach 8th place in the [[iTunes]] chart.
