'''Hawkwind''' <!--Please do not change to 'is' -->are<!-- 'are' is correct UK English. --> an English [[rock music|rock]] band known as one of the earliest [[space rock]] groups. Since their formation in November 1969, Hawkwind have gone through many incarnations and have incorporated many different styles into their music, including [[hard rock]], [[progressive rock]] and [[psychedelic rock]]. They are also regarded as an influential [[proto-punk]] band.<ref name="Abrahams">{{cite magazine | url= http://recordcollectormag.com/reviews/at-the-bbc-1972 | title= Hawkwind- At The BBC: 1972 | magazine=[[Record Collector]] | first=Ian | last=Abrahams | access-date=21 December 2015}}</ref> Their lyrics favour urban and [[List of science fiction themes|science fiction themes]].

Many musicians, dancers and writers have worked with the band since their inception. Notable musicians who have performed in Hawkwind include [[Lemmy]], [[Ginger Baker]], [[Robert Calvert]], [[Nik Turner]] and [[Huw Lloyd-Langton]]. However, the band are most closely associated with their founder, singer, songwriter and guitarist [[Dave Brock]], who is the only remaining original member.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-23957784 | title= Hawkwind star honoured at awards | work=BBC News | date=4 September 2013 | access-date=21 December 2015}}</ref>

Hawkwind are best known for the song "[[Silver Machine]]", which became a number-three UK hit single in 1972, but they scored further hit singles with "[[Urban Guerrilla]]" (another Top 40 hit) and "[[Shot Down in the Night]]". The band had a run of twenty-two of their albums charting in the UK from 1971 to 1993.<ref>{{cite book |editor=David Roberts |title=British Hit Singles and Albums |year=2006 |page=246 |publisher=Guinness World Records Limited |isbn=978-1904994107}}</ref> <!--see talk page about whether blanga merits mention in this article-->

==History==
===1969: formation===
[[File:Dave Brock Hawkwind.jpg|thumb|Dave Brock]]
[[Dave Brock]] and Mick Slattery had been in the London-based [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] band Famous Cure, and a meeting with bassist John Harrison revealed a mutual interest in [[electronic music]] which led the trio to embark upon a new musical venture together. Seventeen-year-old drummer Terry Ollis replied to an advert in a music weekly, while [[Nik Turner]] and Michael "Dik Mik" Davies, old acquaintances of Brock, offered help with transport and gear, but were soon pulled into the band.

Gatecrashing a local talent night at the [[All Saints Hall]], [[Notting Hill]], they were so disorganised as to not even have a name, opting for "Group X" at the last minute, nor any songs, choosing to play an extended 20-minute jam on [[the Byrds]]' "[[Eight Miles High]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceritual.net/history/index.html |title=spaceritual.net history |website=Spaceritual.net |access-date=16 November 2017}}</ref> [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[John Peel]] was in the audience and was impressed enough to tell event organiser, Douglas Smith, to keep an eye on them. Smith signed them up and got them a deal with [[Liberty Records]] on the back of a deal he was setting up for [[Cochise (band)|Cochise]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/mal/MO/philm/friends/douglas.html |title=Philm Freax: Days in the Life of Friends/Frendz Magazine: Doug Smith |first=Phil |last=Franks |website=Ibiblio.org |access-date=16 November 2017}}</ref>

The band settled on the name "Hawkwind" after briefly being billed as "Group X" and "Hawkwind Zoo".<ref name="Quietus">{{cite web |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/05509-dr-rock-hawkwind-interview-dave-brock |title=Dr Rock Goes Intergalactic: An Interview With Hawkwind's Dave Brock |date=January 6, 2011 |work=The Quietus |access-date=13 December 2017}}</ref>

An [[Abbey Road Studios|Abbey Road]] session took place recording demos of "[[Hurry on Sundown]]" and others (included on the remasters version of ''[[Hawkwind (album)|Hawkwind]]''), after which Slattery left to be replaced by [[Huw Lloyd-Langton]], who had known Brock from his days working in a music shop selling guitar strings to Brock, then a [[busking|busker]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Huw Lloyd-Langton...

===1970–1975: United Artists era===
[[Pretty Things]] guitarist [[Dick Taylor]] was brought in to produce the 1970 debut album ''[[Hawkwind (album)|Hawkwind]]''. Although it was not a commercial success, it did bring them to the attention of the [[UK underground]] scene, which found them playing free concerts, benefit gigs, and festivals. Playing free outside the [[Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music|Bath Festival]], they encountered another [[Ladbroke Grove]] based band, the [[Pink Fairies]], who shared similar interests in music and recreational activities; a friendship developed which led to the two bands becoming running partners and performing as "Pinkwind". Their use of drugs, however, led to the departure of Harrison, who did not partake, to be replaced briefly by [[Thomas Crimble (musician)|Thomas Crimble]] (about July 1970–March 1971). Crimble played on [[The Text of Festival|a few BBC sessions]] before leaving to help organise the Glastonbury Free Festival 1971; he sat in during the band's performance there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nikturner.com/tirnanog/glastonbury2010.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518105343/http://www.nikturner.com/tirnanog/glastonbury2010.html|url-status=dead|title=Nik Turner – Glastonbury, 40 Years On|archive-date=18 May 2011}}</ref> Lloyd-Langton also quit, after a bad [[LSD]] trip at the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1970|Isle of Wight Festival]] led to a [[nervous breakdown]].<ref>Mojo, September 1999 – The Egos Have Landed – [http://www.starfarer.net/intvw999.html www.starfarer.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314035625/http://www.starfarer.net/intvw999.html |date=14 March 2012 }}</ref>

Their follow-up album, 1971's ''[[In Search of Space]]'', brought greater commercial success, reaching number 18 on the UK album charts. This album offered a refinement of the band's image and philosophy courtesy of graphic artist [[Barney Bubbles]] and underground press writer [[Robert Calvert]], as depicted in the accompanying ''Hawklog'' booklet, which would be further developed into the ''Space Ritual'' stage show. Science fiction author [[Michael Moorcock]] and dancer [[Stacia]] also started contributing to the band. Dik Mik had left the band, replaced by sound engineer [[Del Dettmar]], but chose to return for this album giving the band two electronics players. Bass player [[Dave Anderson (musician)|Dave Anderson]], who had been in the German band [[Amon Düül II]], had also joined and played on the album but departed before its release because of personal tensions with some other members of the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawkwindmuseum.co.uk/fp1.jpg|title=Hawkwind Family Tree, Pete Frame 1979|website=Hawkwindmuseum.co.uk|access-date=16 November 2017}}</ref> Anderson and Lloyd-Langton then formed the short-lived band Amon Din.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawkwindmuseum.co.uk/huweypt.htm|title=Huwey PT Int|website=Hawkwindmuseum.co.uk|access-date=16 November 2017}}</ref> Meanwhile, Ollis quit, unhappy with the commercial direction the band were heading in.<ref>Carol Clerk, ''The Saga of Hawkwind'', p. 95.</ref>

The addition of bassist [[Lemmy|Ian "Lemmy" Kilmister]] and drummer [[Simon King (musician)|Simon King]] propelled the band to greater heights. One of the early gigs the band played was a benefit for the Greasy Truckers at [[The Roundhouse]] on 13 February 1972. A live album of the concert, ''[[Greasy Truckers Party]]'', was released, and after re-recording the vocal, a single, "[[Silver Machine]]", was also released, reaching number three in the UK charts. This generated sufficient funds for the subsequent album ''[[Doremi Fasol Latido]]'' Space Ritual tour. The show featured dancers Stacia and Miss Renee typically performing either topless or wearing only body paint, mime artist Tony Carrera and a light show by [[Liquid Len]] and was recorded on the elaborate package ''[[Space Ritual]]''. At the height of their success, in 1973, the band released the single "[[Urban Guerrilla]]", which coincided with an [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] bombing campaign in London, so the [[BBC]] refused to play it and the band's management reluctantly decided to withdraw it fearing accusations of opportunism, despite the disc having already climbed to number 39 in the UK chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawkwindmuseum.co.uk/micro.htm|title=micro articles|website=Hawkwindmuseum.co.uk|access-date=16 November 2017}}</ref>

Dik Mik departed during 1973 and Calvert ended his association with the band to concentrate on solo projects. Dettmar also indicated that he was to leave the band, so [[Simon House]] was recruited as keyboardist and violinist playing live shows, a North America tour and recording the 1974 album ''[[Hall of the Mountain Grill]]''. Dettmar left after a European tour and emigrated to Canada, whilst [[Alan Powell (drummer)|Alan Powell]] deputised for an incapacitated King on that European tour, but remained giving the band two drummers.

At the beginning of 1975, the band recorded the album ''[[Warrior on the Edge of Time]]'' in collaboration with [[Michael Moorcock]], loosely based on his [[Eternal Champion (character)|Eternal Champion]] figure. However, during a North American tour in May, Lemmy was caught in possession of [[amphetamine]] crossing the border from the US into Canada. The border police mistook the powder for cocaine and he was jailed, forcing the band to cancel some shows. Fed up with his erratic behaviour, the band dismissed the bass player<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorhead.ru/int7trials.htm|title=The Trials of Lemmy – NME 1975|work=motorhead.ru|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120804215913/http://www.motorhead.ru/int7trials.htm|archive-date=4 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> replacing him with their long-standing friend and former Pink Fairies guitarist [[Paul Rudolph (musician)|Paul Rudolph]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hit-channel.com/interviewnik-turner-hawkwindspace-ritualsphynxinner-city-unit/71548|title=Interview: Nik Turner (Hawkwind,Space Ritual,Sphynx,Inner City Unit)|work=Hit Channel|date=5 November 2014}}</ref> Lemmy then teamed up with another Pink Fairies guitarist, [[Larry Wallis]], to form [[Motörhead]], named after the [[Motorhead (song)|last song]] he had written for Hawkwind.

===1976–1978: Charisma era===
Calvert made a guest appearance with the band for their headline set at the [[Reading Festival]] in August 1975, after which he chose to rejoin the band as a full-time lead vocalist. Stacia chose to relinquish her dancing duties and settle down to family life. The band changed record company to Tony Stratton-Smith's [[Charisma Records]] and, on Stratton-Smith's suggestion, band management from Douglas Smith to Tony Howard.

''[[Astounding Sounds, Amazing Music]]'' is the first album of this era. On the eve of recording the follow-up "[[Back on the Streets (single)|Back on the Streets]]" single, Turner was dismissed for his erratic live playing<ref name = "trgnbs">Hawkwind Family Tree, Pete Frame 1979</ref> and Powell was deemed surplus to requirements. After a tour to promote the single and during the recording of the next album, Rudolph was also dismissed, for allegedly trying to steer the band into a musical direction at odds with Calvert and Brock's vision.<ref name = "trgnbs"/>

[[Adrian "Ade" Shaw]], who, as bass player for Magic Muscle, had supported Hawkwind on the ''Space Ritual'' tour, came in for the 1977 album ''[[Quark, Strangeness and Charm]]''. The band continued to enjoy moderate commercial success, but Calvert's mental illness often caused problems. A manic phase saw the band abandon a European tour in France,<ref>NME, 12 November 1977 – Hawklord in KGB Wedding Affair – [http://www.kadu.demon.co.uk/pages/bobswedding.html Jon's Attic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003015418/http://www.kadu.demon.co.uk/pages/bobswedding.html |date=3 October 2006 }}</ref> while a depression phase during a 1978 North American tour convinced Brock to disband the group.<ref>''This Is Hawkwind, Do Not Panic'', Chapter 6 – Kris Tait.</ref> In between these two tours, the band had recorded the album ''[[PXR5]]'' in January 1978, but its release was delayed until 1979. During the USA tour of Spring 1978, several recordings were made including those at the [[The Bottom Line (venue)|Bottom Line]] club, New York City; The [[Tower Theater (Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania)| Tower Theatre]] in [[Philadelphia]] and the [[Starwood Club]] in [[Los Angeles]].

On 23 December 1977 in [[Barnstaple]], Brock and Calvert had performed a one-off gig with Devon band Ark as the [[Sonic Assassins]], and looking for a new project in 1978, bassist [[Harvey Bainbridge]] and drummer Martin Griffin were recruited from this event. [[Steve Swindells]] was recruited as keyboard player. The band was named [[Hawklords]], (probably for legal reasons, the band having recently split from their management), and recording took place on a farm in Devon using a mobile studio, resulting in the album ''[[25 Years On]]''. King had originally been the drummer for the project but quit during recording sessions to return to London, while House, who had temporarily left the band to join a [[David Bowie]] tour, elected to remain with Bowie full-time, but nevertheless contributed violin to these sessions. At the end of the band's UK tour, Calvert, wanting King back in the band, dismissed Griffin, then promptly resigned himself, choosing to pursue a career in literature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aural-innovations.com/issues/issue18/03_jones.html|title=Working Down A Diamond Mine|website=aural-innovations.com|access-date=16 November 2017|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5w3x6IqGA?url=http://aural-innovations.com/issues/issue18/03_jones.html|archive-date=28 January 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Swindells left to record a solo album after an offer had been made to him by the record company [[Atco Records|ATCO]].

===1979–1986: Bronze, RCA and independents===
In late 1979, Hawkwind reformed with Brock, Bainbridge and King being joined by [[Huw Lloyd-Langton]] (who had played on the debut album) and [[Tim Blake]] (formerly of [[Gong (band)|Gong]]), debuting at the first Futurama (The World's First Science Fiction Music Festival) on 9 September in Leeds,<ref name="FUT1919">{{cite web| url=https://futuramafestival.com/news/futurama-1-1979/| title=Futurama 1 - 1979 - Futurama Festival 2021|access-date=12 June 2021 }}</ref> and then embarking upon a UK tour despite not having a record deal or any product to promote. Some shows were recorded and a deal was made with [[Bronze Records]], resulting in the ''[[Live Seventy Nine]]'' album, quickly followed by the studio album ''[[Levitation (Hawkwind album)|Levitation]]''. However, during the recording of ''Levitation'' King quit and [[Ginger Baker]] was drafted in for the sessions, but he chose to stay with the band for the tour, during which Blake left to be replaced by Keith Hale.

In 1981 Baker and Hale left after their insistence that Bainbridge should be dismissed was ignored,<ref>''This Is Hawkwind, Do Not Panic'', Chapter 7 – Kris Tait.</ref> and Brock and Bainbridge elected to handle synthesisers and sequencers themselves, with drummer Griffin from the Hawklords rejoining. Three albums, which again saw Moorcock contributing lyrics and vocals, were recorded for [[Active Records|RCA/Active]]: ''[[Sonic Attack (album)|Sonic Attack]]'', the electronic ''[[Church of Hawkwind]]'' and ''[[Choose Your Masques]]''. This band headlined the 1981 [[Glastonbury Festival]] and made an appearance at the 1982 [[Monsters of Rock|Donington Monsters of Rock Festival]], as well as continuing to play the summer [[solstice]] at [[Stonehenge Free Festival]].

In the early 1980s, Brock had started using drum machines for his home demos and became increasingly frustrated at the inability of drummers to keep perfect time, leading to a succession of drummers coming and going. First, Griffin was ousted and the band tried King again, but, unhappy with his playing at that time, he was rejected. [[Andy Anderson (drummer)|Andy Anderson]] briefly joined while he was also playing for [[The Cure]], and [[Robert Heaton]] also filled the spot briefly prior to the rise of [[New Model Army (band)|New Model Army]]. [[Lloyd Langton Group]] drummer John Clark did some recording sessions, and in late 1983 Rick Martinez joined the band to play drums on the ''Earth Ritual'' tour in February and March 1984, later replaced by Clive Deamer.

Turner had returned as a guest for the 1982 ''Choose Your Masques'' tour and was invited back permanently. Further tours ensued with Phil "Dead Fred" Reeves augmenting the line-up on keyboards and violin, but neither Turner nor Reeves would appear on the only recording of 1983–84, ''[[The Earth Ritual Preview]]'', however there was a guest spot for Lemmy. The ''Earth Ritual'' tour was filmed for Hawkwind's first video release, ''[[Night of the Hawk (Hawkwind video)|Night of the Hawk]]''.

[[Alan Davey (musician)|Alan Davey]] was a young fan of the band who had sent a tape of his playing to Brock,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawkwindmuseum.co.uk/alan3.htm|title=alan daveyhf|website=Hawkwindmuseum.co.uk|access-date=16 November 2017}}</ref> and Brock chose to oust Reeves moving Bainbridge from bass to keyboards to accommodate Davey. This experimental line-up played at the Stonehenge Free Festival in 1984, which was filmed and release as ''Stonehenge 84''. Subsequent personal and professional tensions between Brock and Turner led to the latter's expulsion at the beginning of 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starfarer.net/clippings12.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716100307/http://www.starfarer.net/clippings12.html|archive-date=2011-07-16|title=Hawkwind Press Clippings Part 12|date=16 July 2011}}</ref> Clive Deamer, who was deemed "too professional" for the band,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/_hwpress/hw19850500muk.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050105004200/http://mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/_hwpress/hw19850500muk.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 January 2005|title=Hawkwind|date=5 January 2005|access-date=26 February 2019}}</ref> was eventually replaced in 1985 by Danny Thompson Jr (son of folk-rock bassist [[Danny Thompson]]), a friend of Alan Davey, and remained almost to the end of the decade.

Hawkwind's association with Moorcock climaxed in their most ambitious project, ''[[The Chronicle of the Black Sword]]'', based loosely around the [[Elric]] series of books and theatrically staged with Tony Crerar as the central character. Moorcock contributed lyrics, but only performed some spoken pieces on some live dates. The tour was recorded and issued as an album ''[[Live Chronicles]]'' and video ''[[The Chronicle of the Black Sword (Hawkwind video)|The Chronicle of the Black Sword]]''. The band also performed at the [[Worldcon]] (World Science Fiction Convention) in Brighton.

In August 1985, The band performed at [[Crystal Palace Bowl]], with several other rock bands, for a benefit concert for [[Pete Townshend]]'s [[Double O (charity)|Double-O]] anti-heroin charity. Lemmy and Stacey were reunited with the band for this event. [[Vera Lynn]] closed the show.<ref name="Cooper">{{cite news |last1=Cooper |first1=Leonie |title=Yes: Dame Vera Lynn played an anti-heroin gig with Hawkwind and Lemmy |url=https://www.nme.com/blogs/dame-vera-lynn-tribute-hawkwind-lemmy-2690867 |access-date=18 June 2020 |work=[[NME]] |date=18 June 2020}}</ref>

===1986–1999: GWR through to EBS===
A headline appearance at the 1986 Reading Festival was followed by a UK tour to promote the ''Live Chronicles'' album which was filmed and released as ''[[Chaos (Hawkwind video)|Chaos]]''. In 1988 the band recorded the album ''[[The Xenon Codex]]'' with Guy Bidmead, but all was not well in the band and soon after, both Lloyd-Langton and Thompson departed.

Drummer Richard Chadwick, who joined in the summer of 1988, had been playing in small alternative free festival bands, most notably Bath's Smart Pils, for a decade and had frequently crossed paths with Hawkwind and Brock. He was initially invited simply to play with the band, but eventually replaced stand in drummer Mick Kirton to become the band's drummer to the present day.

To fill in the gap of lead sound, lost when Lloyd-Langton left, violinist House was re-instated into the line-up in 1989 (having previously been a member from 1974 until 1978), and, notably, Hawkwind embarked on their first North American visit in eleven years (since the somewhat disastrous 1978 tour), in which House did not partake. The successfully received tour was the first of several over the coming years, in an effort by the band to re-introduce themselves to the American market.

[[Bridget Wishart]], an associate of Chadwick's from the festival circuit, also joined to become the band's one and only singing front-woman, the band had been fronted in earlier days by Stacia but only as a dancer. This band produced two albums, 1990's ''[[Space Bandits]]'' and 1991's ''[[Palace Springs (album)|Palace Springs]]'' and also filmed a one-hour appearance for the ''[[Nottingham (Hawkwind video)|Bedrock TV]]'' series with dancer Julie Murray-Anderson, who performed with Hawkwind between 1988 and 1991.

1990 saw Hawkwind tour North America again, the second instalment in a series of American visits made at around this time in an effort to re-establish the Hawkwind brand in America. The original business plan was to hold three consecutive US tours, annually, from 1989 to 1991, with the first losing money, the second breaking even, and the third turning a profit, ultimately bringing Hawkwind back into recognition across the Atlantic. Progress, however, was somewhat stunted, due to ex-member Nik Turner touring the United States with his own band at the time, in which the shows were often marketed as Hawkwind.

Still supporting Space Bandits, 1991 commenced with perhaps the most surprising Hawkwind tour in the band's history, without Dave Brock. Brock's temporary replacement was former Smart Pils guitarist Steve Bemand (who had played with Chadwick and Wishart in the Demented Stoats). The tour began in Amsterdam on 12 March and took in Germany, Greece, Italy and France before wrapping up in Belgium on 10 April after 24 dates.<ref>Sonic Assassins, Chapter 17 – Ian Abrahams (Published by SAF publishing; {{ISBN|0-946719-69-1}})</ref>

In 1991 Bainbridge, House and Wishart departed and the band continued as a three piece relying heavily on synthesisers and sequencers to create a wall-of-sound. The 1992 album ''[[Electric Tepee]]'' combined hard rock and light ambient pieces, while ''[[It is the Business of the Future to be Dangerous]]'' is almost devoid of the rock leanings. ''[[The Business Trip]]'' is a record of the previous album's tour, but rockier as would be expected from a live outing. The ''[[White Zone]]'' album was released under the alias Psychedelic Warriors to distance itself entirely from the rock expectancy of Hawkwind.

A general criticism of techno music at that time was its facelessness and lack of personality, which the band were coming to feel also plagued them.<ref>Clerk, ''The Saga of Hawkwind'', p. 413.</ref> [[Ron Tree]] had known the band on the festival circuit and offered his services as a front-man, and the band duly employed him for the album ''[[Alien 4 (album)|Alien 4]]'' and its accompanying tour which resulted in the album ''[[Love in Space]]'' and ''[[Love in Space (Hawkwind video)|video]]''.

In 1996, unhappy with the musical direction of the band, bassist Davey left, forming his own Middle-Eastern flavoured hard-rock group Bedouin and a Motörhead tribute act named Ace of Spades.<ref>Clerk, ''The Saga of Hawkwind'', p. 418.</ref> His bass playing role was reluctantly picked up by singer Tree and the band were joined full-time by lead guitarist Jerry Richards (another stalwart of the festival scene, playing for Tubilah Dog who had merged with Brock's Agents of Chaos during 1988) for the albums ''[[Distant Horizons]]'' and ''[[In Your Area]]''. Rasta chanter Captain Rizz also joined the band for guest spots during live shows.

===1999–2007: Anniversaries, disputes and Voiceprint===
Hawkestra—a re-union event featuring appearances from past and present members—had originally been intended to coincide with the band's 30th anniversary and the release of the career spanning ''[[Epocheclipse|Epocheclipse – 30 Year Anthology]]'' set, but logistical problems delayed it until 21 October 2000. It took place at the [[Brixton Academy]] with about 20 members taking part in a more than 3-hour set, which was filmed and recorded. Guests included [[Samantha Fox]] who sang "Master of the Universe".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/suffolk/content/articles/2005/10/25/hawkwind_foster_feature.shtml |title=Hawkwind: The Leader Speaks |website=Bbc.co.uk|date=25 October 2005 |access-date=16 November 2017}}</ref> However, arguments and disputes over financial recompense and musical input resulted in the prospect of the event being re-staged unlikely, and any album or DVD release being indefinitely shelved.<ref>Clerk, ''The Saga of Hawkwind'', Chapter 30: The Great Hawkestra Disaster.</ref>

The Hawkestra had set a template for Brock to assemble a core band of Tree, Brock, Richards, Davey, Chadwick and for the use of former members as guests on live shows and studio recordings. The 2000 Christmas Astoria show was recorded with contributions from House, Blake, Rizz, Moorcock, Jez Huggett and Keith Kniveton and released as ''[[Yule Ritual]]'' the following year. In 2001, Davey agreed to rejoin the band permanently, but only after the departure of Tree and Richards.<ref>Clerk, ''The Saga of Hawkwind'', p. 486.</ref>

Meanwhile, having rekindled relationships with old friends at the Hawkestra, Turner organised further Hawkestra gigs resulting in the formation of xhawkwind.com, a band consisting mainly of ex-Hawkwind members and playing old Hawkwind songs. An appearance at Guilfest in 2002 led to confusion as to whether this actually was Hawkwind, sufficiently irking Brock into taking legal action to prohibit Turner from trading under the name Hawkwind. Turner lost the case and the band began performing as [[Space Ritual (band)|Space Ritual]].<ref>Clerk, ''The Saga of Hawkwind'', Chapter 32: The Hawkwars.</ref>

An appearance at the Canterbury Sound Festival in August 2001, resulting in another live album ''[[Canterbury Fayre 2001]]'', saw guest appearances from Lloyd-Langton, House, Kniveton with [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]] on "Silver Machine". The band organised the first of their own weekend festivals, named [[Hawkfest]], in Devon in the summer of 2002. Brown joined the band in 2002 for a Winter tour which featured some [[Kingdom Come (Arthur Brown)|Kingdom Come]] songs and saw appearances from Blake and Lloyd-Langton, the Newcastle show being released on DVD as ''[[Out of the Shadows (Hawkwind video)|Out of the Shadows]]'' and the London show on CD as ''[[Spaced Out in London]]''.

In 2005 a new album ''[[Take Me to Your Leader (Hawkwind album)|Take Me to Your Leader]]'' was released. Recorded by the core band of Brock/Davey/Chadwick, contributors included new keyboardist [[Jason Stuart (musician)|Jason Stuart]], Arthur Brown, tabloid writer and TV personality [[Matthew Wright (television presenter)|Matthew Wright]], 1970s New Wave singer [[Lene Lovich]], Simon House and Jez Huggett. This was followed in 2006 by the CD/DVD ''[[Take Me to Your Future]]''.

The band were the subject of an hour-long television documentary entitled ''Hawkwind: Do Not Panic'' that aired on [[BBC Four]] as part of the ''Originals'' series. It was broadcast on 30 March 2007 and repeated on 10 August 2007. Although Brock participated in its making he did not appear in the programme, it is alleged that he requested all footage of himself be removed after he was denied any artistic control over the documentary.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/shows/freakzone/tracklisting_20070204.shtml BBC 6 Music, Freakzone, 4 February 2007] – Nik Turner interview.</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last = Cumming | first = Tim | title = Hawkwind: They're still feeling mean | journal = [[The Independent]] | date = 30 March 2007 | url = http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/music/features/article2403301.ece | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090822221331/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/hawkwind-theyre-still-feeling-mean-442403.html | archive-date = 22 August 2009 | df = dmy-all }}
</ref> In one of the documentary's opening narratives regarding Brock, it is stated that he declined to be interviewed for the programme because of Nik Turner's involvement, indicating that the two men have still not reconciled over the xhawkwind.com incident.

December 2006 saw the official departure of Alan Davey, who left to perform and record with two new bands: Gunslinger and Thunor. He was replaced by Mr Dibs, a long-standing member of the road crew. The band performed at their annual Hawkfest festival and headlined the US festival Nearfest and played gigs in PA and NY. At the end of 2007, [[Tim Blake]] once again joined the band filling the lead role playing keyboards and [[theremin]]. The band played 5 Christmas dates, the London show being released as an audio CD and video DVD under the title ''[[Knights of Space]]''.

===2008–2016: Atomhenge and Eastworld===
In January 2008 the band reversed its anti-taping policy, long a sore-point with many fans, announcing that it would allow audio recording and non-commercial distribution of such recordings, provided there was no competing official release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hawkwindmuseum.co.uk/trading%20rules.htm |title=trade rules |access-date=17 January 2008|date=16 January 2008 |publisher=Hawkwind Museum}}</ref> At the end of 2008, Atomhenge Records (a subsidiary of [[Cherry Red Records]]) commenced the re-issuing of Hawkwind's back catalogue from the years 1976 through to 1997 with the release of two triple CD anthologies ''[[Spirit of the Age Anthology|Spirit of the Age (anthology 1976–84)]]'' and ''[[Spirit of the Age Anthology|The Dream Goes On (anthology 1985–97)]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cherryred.co.uk/atomhenge/news.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511095822/http://www.cherryred.co.uk/atomhenge/news.htm|archive-date=2011-05-11|title=Atomhenge - news|date=11 May 2011}}</ref>

On 8 September 2008 keyboard player Jason Stuart died due to a brain haemorrhage. In October 2008, [[Niall Hone]] (former Tribe of Cro) joined Hawkwind for their Winter 2008 tour playing guitar, along with returning synth/theremin player Tim Blake. In this period, Hone also occasionally played bass guitar alongside Mr Dibs and used laptops for live electronic improvisation.

In 2009, the band began occasionally featuring Jon Sevink from [[The Levellers (band)|The Levellers]] as guest violinist at some shows. Later that year, Hawkwind embarked on a winter tour to celebrate the band's 40th anniversary, including two gigs on 28 and 29 August marking the anniversary of their first live performances. In 2010, Hawkwind held their annual Hawkfest at the site of the original Isle of Wight Festival, marking the 40th anniversary of their appearance there.

On 21 June 2010, Hawkwind released a studio album entitled ''[[Blood of the Earth]]'' on Eastworld Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/137843|title=Eastworld Recordings Sign HAWKWIND; Blood of the Earth Details Revealed, E-Card Available|website=Bravewords.com|access-date=16 November 2017}}</ref> During and since the ''Blood of the Earth'' support tours, Hone's primary on-stage responsibility shifted to bass, while Mr. Dibs moved to a more traditional lead singer/front man role.

In 2011, Hawkwind toured Australia for the second time.

April 2012 saw the release of a new album, ''[[Onward (album)|Onward]]'', again on Eastworld. Keyboardist Dead Fred rejoined Hawkwind for the 2012 tour in support of ''Onward'' and has since remained with the band. In November 2012, Brock, Chadwick and Hone — credited as "Hawkwind Light Orchestra" — released ''Stellar Variations'' on [[Esoteric Recordings]].

2013 marked the first Hawkeaster, a two-day festival held in Seaton, Devon during the Easter weekend. A US tour was booked for October 2013, but due to health issues, was postponed and later cancelled.

In February 2014, as part of a one-off Space Ritual performance, Hawkwind performed at the O2 Shepherd's Bush Empire featuring an appearance by [[Brian Blessed]] for the spoken word element of Sonic Attack; a studio recording of this performance was released as a single in September 2014.<ref>{{cite web

Following Hawkeaster 2015, Hawkwind made their debut visit to Japan, playing two sold-out shows in Tokyo. Hawkwind performed two Solstice Ritual shows in December 2015, with [[Steve Hillage]] guesting, and Haz Wheaton joining Hawkwind on bass guitar. Wheaton is a former member of the band's road crew who had previously appeared with Technicians of Spaceship Hawkwind, a "skeleton crew" spin off live band. Additionally, he had guested on bass for Dave Brock's solo album ''Brockworld'' released earlier in the year.

===2016: Cherry Red projects===
The band released ''[[The Machine Stops (album)|The Machine Stops]]'' on 15 April 2016, a [[concept album]] based on [[E.M. Forster]]'s short story of the [[The Machine Stops|same name]].<ref name="MachineStopsCD">{{cite web | url=https://www.cherryred.co.uk/product/the-machine-stops/ | title=The Machine Stops CD Version | publisher=Cherry Red Records | access-date=17 November 2020}}</ref> Brock and Chadwick were joined on the recording by Hone, Dibs and Wheaton sharing bass duties, while Hone and Dead Fred contributed one solo piece each. The album entered the UK album chart at number 29. Dead Fred's last live appearance was at Eastbourne Winter Gardens on 1 April; Hone took on keyboard and synth duties until Blake returned for the summer shows.

The trio of Brock, Chadwick and Wheaton recorded the album ''[[Into the Woods (Hawkwind album)|Into the Woods]]'', released on 5 May 2017, with additional contributions from Dibs, Magnus Martin (whose band Tarantism had supported Hawkwind on many occasions) and Big Bill Barry.<ref name="IntoTheWoodsCD">{{cite web|url=https://www.cherryred.co.uk/product/into-the-woods-deluxe-cd-edition/ |title=Into The Woods: Deluxe CD Edition |website=Cherryred.co.uk |access-date=2020-11-16}}</ref><ref name="IntoTheWoodsLP">{{cite web|url=https://www.cherryred.co.uk/product/into-the-woods-double-vinyl-lp-edition/ |title=Into The Woods: Double Vinyl LP Edition |website=Cherryred.co.uk |access-date=2020-11-16}}</ref> Martin and saxophonist Michał Sosna (from Polish group hipiersoniK) joined the band for a 16-date UK promotional tour in the same month, and festival appearances at [[Hellfest (French music festival)|Hellfest]], [[Clisson]], France in June and [[Bluedot Festival]] at [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]], [[Cheshire]] in July. The [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]] gig, with a guest appearance from [[Phil Campbell (musician)|Phil Campbell]], was released as ''Hawkwind At The Roundhouse'' on 8 December in 2CD/DVD and 3LP formats.<ref name="AtTheRoundhouseCD">{{cite web|url=https://www.cherryred.co.uk/product/hawkwind-roundhouse-2cd1dvd-boxset/ |title=At The Roundhouse: Deluxe CD Edition |website=Cherryred.co.uk |access-date=2020-11-16}}</ref>

For the ''Into The Woods'' tour the group had performed an opening acoustic set before the main set, and they decided to capture some acoustic performances of their 1970s repertoire in the studio. A chance meeting with [[Mike Batt]] by Brock at the [[Embassy of the United States, London|US Embassy]] brought him into the project contributing production, arrangement and additional orchestrations. The album ''[[Road to Utopia (album)|Road to Utopia]]'' was released on 14 September 2018.<ref name="RoadToUtopiaCD">{{cite web | url=https://www.cherryred.co.uk/product/hawkwind-road-to-utopia/ | title=Hawkwind: Road To Utopia | publisher=Cherry Red Records | access-date=11 July 2018}}</ref> There was a guest appearance from [[Eric Clapton]], who Brock had performed with as a duo in the 1960s prior to his rise to fame in [[The Yardbirds]].<ref name=HowEricClapton>{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Dave |date=2006 |title=Cream: How Eric Clapton Took the World by Storm |location=London |publisher=Virgin Books |pages=31–32 |author-link=Dave Thompson (author)}}</ref>  Batt conducted a series of concerts titled ''In Search of Utopia - Infinity and Beyond'' featuring the band and [[Docklands Sinfonia]] Orchestra in October and November, with [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]] guesting.<ref name="RoadToUtopiaCD" /> After the recording of the album but before the shows, both Wheaton and Dibs left, while Hone rejoined on bass. Wheaton went on to join [[Electric Wizard]], and Dibs stated "irreconcilable differences" on the Hawkwind fans Facebook page, Brock claiming "we propped the fella up and kept him in the band longer than he should have been, because we were genuinely concerned... about his state of mind."<ref name="RecordCollector2020">{{cite web | url=https://recordcollectormag.com/articles/dave-brock | title=Issue 502: Dave Brock | publisher=[[Record Collector]] | date=21 January 2020 | access-date=17 November 2020}}</ref>

In October 2019 the group released ''[[All Aboard the Skylark]]'', marketed as a return to their space rock roots. This was the first album with the line-up of Brock, Chadwick, Hone and Martin. Accompanying the CD version, and sold as a separate vinyl LP, was ''Acoustic Daze'' which included tracks from the ''Road to Utopia'' minus the additions of Batt and Clapton.<ref name="AllAboardTheSkylark">{{cite web|url=https://www.cherryred.co.uk/product/hawkwind-all-aboard-the-skylark-2cd/ |title=Hawkwind: All Aboard The Skylark, 2CD - Cherry Red Records |website=Cherryred.co.uk |access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref> The album was promoted with a 15 date tour of Britain in November, culminating in a final show at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]].

Brock had started work on new material in his home studio with some contributions from Chadwick and Martin when the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] spread curtailing any further band activity. Brock would continue work with remote contributions from Martin, and the album ''Carnivorous'' (an anagram of [[coronavirus]]) was released in October 2020 under the name Hawkwind Light Orchestra to reflect the reduced personnel.<ref name="CARNLP">{{cite web|title=Hawkwind Light Orchestra: Carnivorous, CD Edition|url=https://www.cherryred.co.uk/product/hawkwind-lightorchestra-carnivorous-cd/|author=Cherry Red Records|author-link=Cherry Red Records|access-date=4 November 2020}}</ref><ref name="CARNCD">{{cite web|title=Hawkwind Light Orchestra: Carnivorous, LP Edition|url=https://www.cherryred.co.uk/product/hawkwind-carnivorous-vinyl/|author=Cherry Red Records|author-link=Cherry Red Records|access-date=4 November 2020}}</ref>

When the group returned to live performances post-COVID in late 2021, the line-up featured Brock, Chadwick, Martin and new members [[Thighpaulsandra]] on keyboards and Doug MacKinnon on bass, replacing Blake and Hone respectively. A new Hawkwind album, ''Somnia'', was released in September 2021.

Hard rock musician [[Lemmy]] of the band [[Motörhead]] gained a lot from his tenure in Hawkwind. He has remarked, "I really found myself as an instrumentalist in Hawkwind. Before that I was just a guitar player who was pretending to be good, when actually I was no good at all. In Hawkwind I became a good bass player. It was where I learned I was good at something."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/lemmy-id-still-be-in-hawkwind-if-they-hadnt-fired-me/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224164050/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/lemmy-id-still-be-in-hawkwind-if-they-hadnt-fired-me/|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 February 2014|title=Lemmy: I'd still be in Hawkwind if they hadn't fired me – Classic Rock|date=24 February 2014|access-date=16 November 2017}}</ref>
