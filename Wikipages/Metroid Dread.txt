{{Nihongo foot|'''''Metroid Dread'''''|メトロイド ドレッド|Metoroido Doreddo|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is an [[action-adventure game]] developed by [[MercurySteam]] and [[Nintendo EPD]], released on October 8, 2021, for the [[Nintendo Switch]]. Players control bounty hunter [[Samus Aran]] as she investigates the source of a mysterious transmission on the planet ZDR. It retains the [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] gameplay of previous 2D ''[[Metroid]]'' games and incorporates [[Stealth game|stealth]] elements.

''Dread'' was conceived for the [[Nintendo DS]] in the mid-2000s, but was canceled due to technical limitations. Industry commentators expressed interest in a new 2D ''Metroid'' game, and listed ''Dread'' in their "most wanted" lists. After their work on ''[[Metroid: Samus Returns]]'' in 2017, ''Metroid'' producer [[Yoshio Sakamoto]] appointed MercurySteam to develop ''Dread'', the first original side-scrolling ''Metroid'' game since ''[[Metroid Fusion]]'' (2002). Nintendo announced the game at [[E3 2021]].

''Dread'' received positive reviews from critics, and became the fastest-selling game in the ''Metroid'' franchise in Japan, the UK and the US upon its release. It has been nominated for [[The Game Award for Game of the Year|Game of the Year]] at [[The Game Awards 2021]].

==Gameplay==
''Metroid Dread'' is an [[action-adventure game]] in which players control bounty hunter [[Samus Aran]] as she explores the planet ZDR. It retains the [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] gameplay of previous ''Metroid'' games, alongside the free aim and melee attacks added in ''[[Metroid: Samus Returns|Samus Returns]]'' (2017). As the player explores, they discover new items and weapons, allowing them to access new areas.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=''Metroid Dread'', a 2D sidescroller, gets E3 reveal|url=https://kotaku.com/nintendo-announces-metroid-dread-1847072111|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-16|website=[[Kotaku]]|language=en-us|archive-date=June 16, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210616054712/https://kotaku.com/nintendo-announces-metroid-dread-1847072111}}</ref>

''Dread'' adds [[Stealth game|stealth]] elements, with Samus avoiding the EMMI robots in certain areas by hiding, reducing her noise, and using the Phantom Cloak, camouflage that makes her invisible but slows her movement. If an EMMI catches Samus, the player has two brief chances to perform melee counters and escape. If they fail, Samus is killed. EMMIs can only be destroyed when Samus obtains the temporary "Omega Blaster" upgrade, which is lost upon using it to destroy one; however, destroying an EMMI grants Samus a new permanent upgrade.<ref name=":2" /> Players unlock images in an in-game gallery based on their completion time, difficulty level, and percentage of items collected.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Parks |first1=William |title=''Metroid Dread'': All 100% Completion Rewards |url=https://gamerant.com/metroid-dread-100-completion-rewards/ |website=Game Rant |access-date=October 24, 2021 |date=October 20, 2021}}</ref>

==Plot==
{{Metroid Story Order}}
The Galactic Federation receives video evidence that the X, a dangerous species of parasite that can mimic any creature it infects, survives on the remote planet ZDR. The species was thought to be extinct since the events of ''[[Metroid Fusion]]''. They dispatch seven EMMI (Extraplanetary Multiform Mobile Identifiers) robots to ZDR to investigate, but lost contact with them shortly after. The Federation sends Samus Aran to ZDR to investigate.

Samus encounters a Chozo warrior deep underground, who destroys the exit, defeats her in combat and strips her suit of most of its abilities. Samus is instructed by her ship's computer, Adam, to find another path to the surface and return to her ship. Samus is attacked by the EMMI, which have been reprogrammed to consider her hostile. She escapes and absorbs mysterious energy from one of the planet's central units. The energy temporarily enables the Omega Blaster, with which she destroys the EMMI and regains some of her abilities.

In the Chozo sanctuary of Ferenia, Samus is captured by another EMMI but is saved by a Chozo named Quiet Robe, who deactivates them. Quiet Robe explains that, long ago, two Chozo tribes, the scientific Thoha and warrior Mawkin, banded together to trap the [[Metroid (fictional species)|Metroids]] on the planet SR388. The Thoha intended to destroy SR388 to eliminate the threat of the Metroids and X, but Raven Beak, the Mawkin leader and the Chozo who attacked Samus, wanted to use the Metroids as a bioweapon to conquer the galaxy. He slaughtered the Thoha tribe and spared Quiet Robe so the Metroids could be controlled with his Thoha DNA, but upon his return to ZDR his plans were delayed when a Mawkin soldier was infected with an X while returning and a [[pandemic]] broke out, while Samus eradicated the Metroids on SR388. However, once he learned that Samus had Metroid DNA implanted in her during the events of ''Metroid Fusion'', Raven Beak reprogrammed the EMMI robots and lured Samus to ZDR to extract the Metroid DNA in order to revive the extinct Metroids.

After Samus swears to stop Raven Beak, Quiet Robe opens a barrier to allow Samus to progress before he is assassinated by one of Raven Beak's robotic soldiers. In the Elun region, Samus encounters the X parasites and inadvertently releases them into the rest of the planet; one of the X possesses Quiet Robe's corpse and reactivates the remaining EMMI. Samus arrives on the surface, where she is attacked by the last of the EMMI; she destroys it by sapping its energy with her hand, a power gained from her Metroid DNA.

On the floating fortress of Itorash, Samus confronts Raven Beak, who has been masquerading as Adam. Raven Beak reveals that he spared her before so that she would awaken her Metroid powers. Raven Beak was a DNA donor for Samus when she was accepted into the Chozo, technically making them biologically related; he demands she submit and offer up her power, but she refuses. Samus battles Raven Beak but he gains the upper hand, revealing that her cooperation is no longer necessary and reveals a new plan: to clone Samus herself to create an army of the most powerful Metroid of all. Samus becomes enraged, fully awakening her Metroid abilities and she uses its energy-draining abilities to overpower Raven Beak while draining energy from Itorash and causing it to crash into ZDR. Raven Beak survives the crash but is shortly thereafter infected by an X, and Samus uses her newfound powers to destroy him. She also destroys the X that infested him, something that was once considered impossible for other races as the parasites are themselves, indestructible. Samus retreats to her ship as ZDR begins to self-destruct, but is unable to use the ship due to her energy-draining Metroid powers. The X possessing Quiet Robe appears and allows itself to be absorbed into Samus to neutralize her Metroid abilities, showing the same kindness that the Thoha himself showed to her when they first met, allowing her to escape ZDR before it explodes.
