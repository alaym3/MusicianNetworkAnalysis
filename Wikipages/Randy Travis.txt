'''Randy Bruce Traywick''' (born May 4, 1959), known professionally as '''Randy Travis''', is an American [[country music]] and [[gospel music]] singer, songwriter, guitarist, and actor.<ref name="Larkin">{{Cite book |title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] |date=1997 |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |isbn=1-85227-745-9 |editor-last=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]] |edition=Concise |page=1190}}</ref>

Active from 1978 until being incapacitated by a stroke in 2013, he has recorded 20 studio albums and charted more than 50 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including sixteen that reached the No.&nbsp;1 position. Considered a pivotal figure in the history of country music,<ref name="allmusic" /> Travis broke through in the mid-1980s with the release of his album ''[[Storms of Life]]'', which sold more than four million copies. The album established him as a major force in the [[neotraditional country]] movement. Travis followed up his successful debut with a string of platinum and multi-platinum albums. He is known for his distinctive baritone vocals, delivered in a traditional style that has made him a country music star since the 1980s.

By the mid-1990s, Travis saw a decline in his chart success. In 1997, he left [[Warner Bros. Records]] for [[DreamWorks Records]] and then for [[Word Records]], where he began recording more Christian material. Although the career shift produced only one more number-one country hit "[[Three Wooden Crosses]]", Travis went on to earn several [[Dove Awards]], including Country Album of the Year five times. Since his stroke, which severely limited his singing and speaking ability, he has released archival recordings and made limited public appearances. In addition to his singing career, he pursued an acting career, appearing in numerous films and television series, including ''[[The Rainmaker (1997 film)|The Rainmaker]]'' (1997) with [[Matt Damon]], ''[[Black Dog (film)|Black Dog]]'' (1998) with [[Patrick Swayze]], ''[[Texas Rangers (film)|Texas Rangers]]'' (2001) with [[James Van Der Beek]], ''[[National Treasure 2]]'' (2007) and seven episodes of the ''[[Touched by an Angel]]'' television series. He appeared in two episodes of the crime solving television series, ''Matlock''.

Travis Sold over 25 million records and has won seven Grammy Awards,<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/randy-travis |title=Randy Travis |date=June 4, 2019 |publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences |access-date=September 29, 2019}}</ref> six [[Country Music Association|CMA Awards]], eleven [[Academy of Country Music|ACM Awards]], 10 [[American Music Award|AMA Awards]], eight [[GMA Dove Award]]s, and a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p1846/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Randy Travis Biography |last1=Mansfield |first1=Brian |author2-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |last2=Erlewine |first2=Stephen Thomas |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=September 10, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.randytravis.com/about |title=About Randy Travis |access-date=September 18, 2011}}</ref> In 2016, Travis was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2016/03/29/watch-live-country-music-hall-fame-inductees-revealed/82364774/ |last=Watts |first=Cindy |title=Randy Travis, Charlie Daniels, Fred Foster to be inducted to Country Music Hall of Fame |newspaper=[[The Tennessean]] |date=March 29, 2016 |access-date=March 29, 2016}}</ref>

==Early life==
Randy Bruce Traywick was born on May 4, 1959, in [[Marshville, North Carolina]],<ref name="allmusic" /><ref name="Gregory">Gregory, Andy (2002) ''International Who's Who in Popular Music 2002'', Europa, {{ISBN|978-1-85743-161-2}}, p. 511</ref> as the second of six children of Bobbie (''née'' Tucker) (May 16, 1937 – May 21, 1998), a textile factory worker, and Harold Traywick (March 31, 1933 – October 8, 2016), a horse breeder, turkey farmer, substitute school teacher, and construction business owner.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/65/Randy-Travis.html |title=Randy Travis Biography (1959-) |website=Filmreference.com |access-date=September 29, 2019}}</ref><ref name=nice/>

Travis and his brother, Ricky, were encouraged to pursue their musical talents by their father, who was a fan of [[Hank Williams]], [[George Jones]], and [[Lefty Frizzell]].<ref name="Larkin" /> In 1967, at the age of eight, Randy began playing guitar and sang in his Church of Christ choir. Two years later, he and his brother began performing at local clubs and talent contests, calling themselves the Traywick Brothers.<ref name="allmusic" /> Although his father encouraged Travis in his pursuit of music, the two often quarreled, which was a contributing factor in Travis dropping out of high school;<ref>Gates, D. (October 22, 1990), "The voice of country music". ''Newsweek''. '''116''' (17):70.</ref> he later became a [[Juvenile delinquency|juvenile delinquent]] and was arrested for various offenses, including auto theft and burglary.<ref name="Larkin" /> However, Travis has since voiced regret for his past misdeeds.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kidsofwidneyhigh.com/2008/08/04/welcome-to-the-kids-new-home-online/ |title=Blog Archive " Welcome to the Kids' New Home Online |publisher=The Kids of Widney High |access-date=March 18, 2009}}</ref>

In 1975, Randy won a talent contest at a nightclub, Country City USA, in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. The club's owner, Elizabeth "Lib" Hatcher, took an interest in the young singer,<ref name="Larkin" /> hired him as a cook, and gave him regular singing jobs at the club.<ref name="nice">Miller, H.G. (October 1988), "Randy Travis: nice guy finishes first". ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]''. '''260''' (7):60–91.</ref> During the late 1970s, Randy worked and sang at Country City USA. Still in his late teens, Travis had one more encounter with the law. At his hearing, the judge told Travis that if he ever saw the singer back in his court, he should be prepared to go to jail for a long time. Travis was released into the guardianship of Hatcher, who also became his manager. The two began to focus on his career full-time.<ref name="allmusic" />

In 1978, he began recording for Paula Records.<ref name="Larkin" /> His first single with the label, "Dreamin'", was released in April 1978 and failed to chart. A second single, "She's My Woman", was released in September 1978 and spent four weeks on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, peaking at number 91.<ref name="whitburn" /> A full album on Paula Records was never released. Travis moved in with Hatcher, which put further strain on her already fragile marriage. She eventually left her husband and, in 1982, she and Travis moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. During this time an unlikely romance began to form between the two. Travis would later comment, "I think we discovered how much we needed each other."<ref name="aloha">[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20063512,00.html "The Aloha Cowboy"]. ''People''. '''42''' (9):36. September 14, 1994.</ref> He and Hatcher eventually came forward with their relationship and were married in a private ceremony in 1991.<ref name=aloha/>

== Music career ==
During the early 1980s, Travis was rejected by every major record label in Nashville. His early demo tapes were criticized by record executives as being "too country." To support them, Hatcher took a job as manager of a nightclub, The Nashville Palace, and hired Travis as a cook and singer,<ref name=nice/> where he performed under the name Randy Ray.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/flashback-see-randy-travis-perform-as-randy-ray-20150716 |title=Flashback: See Randy Travis Perform As 'Randy Ray' |website=Rolling Stone |date=July 16, 2015 |access-date=September 29, 2019}}</ref> In 1982, Travis recorded an independent album ''Live at the Nashville Palace'', and Hatcher used the album to secure a deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]]' Nashville branch.<ref name="Larkin" /> As part of the contract, label executives insisted they keep their romance a secret, and changed his stage name again, to Randy Travis.<ref name=aloha/>

In 1985, Warner Bros. Records released the single "[[On the Other Hand]]" which peaked at No.&nbsp;67 on the country charts.<ref name="Larkin" /> His next single, "[[1982 (Randy Travis song)|1982]]", became a Top 10 hit single.<ref name="Larkin" /> In 1986, Warner Bros. re-released "On the Other Hand", and the re-release became Travis's first No.&nbsp;1 single on that chart.<ref name="allmusic" /> These songs were included on his major-label debut ''[[Storms of Life]]'', which produced another number-one country single in "[[Diggin' Up Bones]]", plus "[[No Place Like Home (Randy Travis song)|No Place Like Home]]", which held the No.&nbsp;2 position on the ''Billboard'' country charts in early 1987.<ref name="Larkin" /> "On the Other Hand", "Diggin' Up Bones", and "No Place Like Home" were all co-written by [[Paul Overstreet]].<ref name="whitburn" /> ''Storms of Life'' received its highest [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) sales certification in 1992, when it was certified triple-platinum for shipments of 3 million copies.<ref name="riaa">{{Cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=randy+travis#search_section |title=RIAA search results |website=RIAA.com |access-date=November 23, 2017}}</ref> The album's producer was [[Kyle Lehning]], who would also serve in this capacity for nearly all of Travis's subsequent albums. In December 1986, Travis became a member of the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]''.<ref name="Larkin" />

Travis's second album for Warner Bros. was ''[[Always & Forever (Randy Travis album)|Always & Forever]]''. Released in April 1987, it accounted for four singles, all of which made No.&nbsp;1 at ''Billboard'': "[[Forever and Ever, Amen]]" (also co-written by Overstreet), "[[I Won't Need You Anymore (Always and Forever)]]", "[[Too Gone Too Long]]", and "[[I Told You So (Randy Travis song)|I Told You So]]", the last of which Travis wrote himself.<ref name="Larkin" /><ref name="whitburn" /> Of these, "Forever and Ever, Amen" held the top position for three weeks.<ref name="whitburn" /> ''Always & Forever'' won Travis his first Grammy for Best Male Country Vocal Performance in 1987.<ref name="whitburn" /> ''[[Old 8×10]]'', his third album, was issued in July 1988. Its first three singles, "[[Honky Tonk Moon]]", "[[Deeper Than the Holler]]", and "[[Is It Still Over?]]", all reached No.&nbsp;1 as well, while "[[Promises (Randy Travis song)|Promises]]" was less successful at No.&nbsp;17.<ref name="whitburn" /> The album achieved its highest RIAA certification of double-platinum in 1996,<ref name="riaa" /> and won Travis his second Grammy, for Best Country Vocal Performance, with ''Old 8x10'' in 1988<ref name=":0" />''.'' This was followed by Travis's first Christmas album, ''[[An Old Time Christmas]]'', late in 1989.<ref name="Larkin" />

In 1989, Travis recorded a cover of "[[It's Just a Matter of Time (song)|It's Just a Matter of Time]]",<ref name="Larkin" /> which was originally recorded by [[Brook Benton]] 30 years prior. Travis cut the song for a multi-artist tribute album titled ''Rock, Rhythm & Blues'' which was also released by Warner Bros., and persuaded the label to include it on what would become his fourth Warner album, ''[[No Holdin' Back]]''.<ref name="Larkin" /> Travis's version of the song, produced by [[Richard Perry]] (who also provided [[bass (vocal range)|bass]] vocals on it), was the lead single to that album, and charted at No.&nbsp;1 on Hot Country Songs in December 1989. It was the second time that a rendition of that song had topped the country charts, as [[Sonny James]] had previously sent his version to No.&nbsp;1 in 1970.{{sfn|Roland|1991|p=570}} Two more singles were released from ''No Holdin' Back'': "[[Hard Rock Bottom of Your Heart]]", which became Travis's longest-lasting No.&nbsp;1 single at four weeks in 1990, and "[[He Walked on Water]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;3.<ref name="whitburn" /> The album included one other cover song, "[[Singing the Blues]]",<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/no-holdin-back-mw0000202071 |title=No Holdin' Back |last=Jurek |first=Thom |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=November 23, 2017}}</ref> along with the track "[[Somewhere in My Broken Heart]]", co-written and later recorded by [[Billy Dean]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/young-man-mw0000310327 |title=Young Man |last=Roland |first=Tom |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=November 23, 2017}}</ref>

===1990s===
Travis's sixth studio album, ''[[Heroes & Friends]]'', consisted almost entirely of duets.<ref name="heroes">{{Cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/heroes-and-friends-mw0000309582 |title=Heroes & Friends |last=Mansfield |first=Brian |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=November 23, 2017}}</ref> It produced two singles: "[[A Few Ole Country Boys]]" (featuring [[George Jones]]) and the [[Heroes and Friends|title track]], also the only solo cut on the album,<ref name="heroes" /> both made top 10 on the country music charts in 1991.<ref name="whitburn" /> Other featured artists included [[B. B. King]] and [[Clint Eastwood]].<ref name="heroes" /> Another cut from the album was "We're Strangers Again", a duet with [[Tammy Wynette]]. Written by [[Merle Haggard]] and [[Leona Williams]], this song originally appeared on their 1983 duets album ''[[Heart to Heart (Merle Haggard album)|Heart to Heart]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/mw0000898987 |title=Heart to Heart |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=November 23, 2017}}</ref> The rendition by Travis and Wynette later appeared on the latter's ''Best Loved Hits'' compilation for [[Epic Records]], who issued it as a single in August 1991.<ref name="whitburn" />

Also in 1991, Travis took part in "[[Voices That Care]]", a multi-artist project that featured other top names in music for a one-off single to raise money for the allied troops in the [[Gulf War]]. He also appeared on ''[[Sesame Street]]'' that same year. The project included fellow singers [[Garth Brooks]], [[Kenny Rogers]], and [[Kathy Mattea]]. In addition, Travis recorded the patriotic song "[[Point of Light]]" in response to the [[Thousand points of light]] program initiated by [[George H. W. Bush]], then the President of the United States. This song was also the lead single to his seventh Warner album, ''[[High Lonesome (Randy Travis album)|High Lonesome]]''. This album produced three more singles, all of which Travis co-wrote with fellow country singer [[Alan Jackson]]: "[[Forever Together]]", "[[Better Class of Losers]]", and "[[I'd Surrender All]]".<ref name="whitburn" />

Warner Bros. released two volumes of a Greatest Hits package in September 1992: ''[[Greatest Hits, Volume 1 (Randy Travis album)|Greatest Hits, Volume 1]]'' and ''[[Greatest Hits, Volume 2 (Randy Travis album)|Greatest Hits, Volume 2]]''.<ref name="Larkin" /> One single from each compilation made No.&nbsp;1 that year: "[[If I Didn't Have You (Randy Travis song)|If I Didn't Have You]]" from ''Volume 1'', and "[[Look Heart, No Hands]]" from ''Volume 2''. Also released from ''Volume 1'' was "[[An Old Pair of Shoes]]", which charted at No.&nbsp;21.<ref name="whitburn" /> Later in 1992, Travis cut the album ''[[Wind in the Wire]]'', a disc of cowboy-inspired [[Western music (North America)|Western music]]<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Mullins |first=Jesse |date=May–June 1995 |title=Back Where He Belongs |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1OoCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA57 |magazine=American Cowboy |pages=57–59}}</ref> intended to accompany a television movie of the same name in which Travis appeared. This disc was his first not to produce any Top 40 country singles.<ref name="allmusic" /> Due to ''Wind in the Wire'' and other TV movies in which he starred, Travis took a hiatus from recording and touring for most of 1993. He later told ''Billboard'' magazine that "There seems to be this perception that I've completely quit".<ref name="wind">{{Cite magazine |last=Bessman |first=Jim |date=March 26, 1994 |title=New Warner Set Returns Travis To Country Spotlite |url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/90s/1994/BB-1994-03-26.pdf |magazine=Billboard |pages=14, 127}}</ref>

Lehning remarked of Travis's ninth album, ''[[This Is Me (Randy Travis album)|This Is Me]]'', that the singer seemed "reinvigorated", while Travis himself said that the songs on it seemed more "rowdy" than those on previous albums.<ref name="wind" /> Four singles from this album made the charts: "[[Before You Kill Us All]]", "[[Whisper My Name]]" (which peaked at No.&nbsp;1 in 1994), the [[This Is Me (Randy Travis song)|title track]], and "[[The Box (Randy Travis song)|The Box]]".<ref name="whitburn" /> His last album for Warner was 1996's ''[[Full Circle (Randy Travis album)|Full Circle]]'', which featured the singles "[[Are We in Trouble Now]]" (written by [[Mark Knopfler]]), "[[Would I]]", and "Price to Pay", the last of which failed to reach the country top 40. Also in 1996, Travis covered [[Roger Miller]]'s "[[King of the Road (song)|King of the Road]]" for the soundtrack to ''[[Traveller (1997 film)|Traveller]]''. This rendition, issued by [[Asylum Records]], spent 15 weeks on the country charts despite only peaking at No.&nbsp;51.<ref name="whitburn" />

In 1998, Travis won his third Grammy for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals for ''Same Old Train''<ref name=":0" />''.'' He then signed to [[DreamWorks Records]] later in 1998, where he issued ''[[You and You Alone (album)|You and You Alone]]''. For this album, Travis co-produced with [[Byron Gallimore]] (best known for his work with [[Tim McGraw]]) and [[James Stroud]]. Featured artists on the disc included [[Vince Gill]], [[Alison Krauss]], and [[Melba Montgomery]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/you-and-you-alone-mw0000035388 |title=You and You Alone |last=Owens |first=Thom |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=November 23, 2017}}</ref> Actor [[Patrick Swayze]] also contributed backing vocals on the track "I Did My Part".<ref name="liner">{{Cite AV media notes |title=You and You Alone |others=Randy Travis |year=1998 |type=CD booklet |publisher=DreamWorks Records |id=50034}}</ref> Its singles were "[[Out of My Bones]]", "[[The Hole (song)|The Hole]]", "[[Spirit of a Boy, Wisdom of a Man]]" (co-written by former [[Styx (band)|Styx]] member [[Glen Burtnik]]), and "[[Stranger in My Mirror]]".<ref name="whitburn" /> His only other DreamWorks album, ''[[A Man Ain't Made of Stone]]'', followed in 1999. Also co-produced by Stroud and Gallimore, it produced a Top 20 hit in its [[A Man Ain't Made of Stone (song)|title track]], but three other singles all failed to make top 40.<ref name="whitburn" />

===2000s===
Travis's career from 2000 onward was dominated by [[Christian country music]]. His first full album in the genre, 2000's ''[[Inspirational Journey]]'', was issued via [[Word Records]]. One cut from this album, "[[Baptism (song)|Baptism]]", was originally recorded by [[Kenny Chesney]] as a duet with Travis on Chesney's 1999 album ''[[Everywhere We Go]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/everywhere-we-go-mw0000663962 |title=Everywhere We Go |last=Roach |first=Pemberton |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=November 23, 2017}}</ref> The version appearing on ''Inspirational Journey'', a solo rendition by Travis, charted at No.&nbsp;75 on the country charts in late 2000.<ref name="whitburn" /> Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, Travis recorded the patriotic song "America Will Always Stand", which charted via distribution from Relentless Records.<ref name="whitburn" />

Travis's most successful venture in Christian country music was "[[Three Wooden Crosses]]". Released in December 2002 as the lead single to his album ''[[Rise and Shine (Randy Travis album)|Rise and Shine]]'', that song became his sixteenth and final No.&nbsp;1 single in early 2003.<ref name="whitburn" /> It was followed by ''[[Worship & Faith]]'', consisting mostly of gospel standards, in 2003. This album earned an RIAA gold certification three years after its release.<ref name="riaa" /> In addition, ''[[Rise and Shine (Randy Travis album)|Rise and Shine]]'' and ''[[Worship & Faith]]'' earned Travis his fourth and fifth Grammys in 2003 and 2004, respectively, with Travis taking home the award for Best Southern, Country, or Bluegrass Gospel Album in both years.<ref name=":0" /> Next came ''[[Passing Through (Randy Travis album)|Passing Through]]'', which accounted for his last solo chart entries in "Four Walls" and "Angels".<ref name="whitburn" /> ''[[Glory Train: Songs of Faith, Worship, and Praise]]'' in 2005 also consisted largely of gospel covers, while his second Christmas album, ''[[Songs of the Season]]'', followed in 2007. Travis won his sixth Grammy, for ''[[Glory Train: Songs of Faith, Worship, and Praise|Glory Train]],'' for Best Southern, Country, or Bluegrass Gospel Album of the year in 2006.<ref name=":0" />

''[[Around the Bend (album)|Around the Bend]]'' in 2008 returned Travis to a traditional country style, coinciding with a return to Warner Bros. Nashville. [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] noted of Travis's career in the preceding years that his turn to Christian music "was fruitful, producing a series of good, heartfelt records, yet they also had a nice side effect of putting commercialism way on the back burner, as the gospel albums were made without the charts in mind" while adding that ''Around the Bend'' "stands apart from trends, not defiantly but comfortably."<ref name="bend">{{Cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/around-the-bend-mw0000784592 |title=Around the Bend |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=November 23, 2017}}</ref> In 2009, [[Carrie Underwood]] covered "I Told You So" with Travis on duet vocals,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.countryuniverse.net/2009/03/24/carrie-underwood-featuring-randy-travis-i-told-you-so/ |title=Carrie Underwood featuring Randy Travis, "I Told You So" |last=Coyne |first=Kevin John |date=March 24, 2009 |website=Country Universe |access-date=November 23, 2017}}</ref> and this collaborative version charted at No.&nbsp;2 on the country charts<ref name="whitburn" /> and won Travis his seventh Grammy for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals.<ref name=":0" /> Travis released two more covers albums in 2013 and 2014: ''[[Influence Vol. 1: The Man I Am]]'', and ''[[Influence Vol. 2: The Man I Am]]''.

In 2016, Travis was selected as one of 30 artists to appear in the music video for "[[Forever Country]]", a mash-up track of "[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]", "[[On the Road Again (Willie Nelson song)|On the Road Again]]", and "[[I Will Always Love You]]", which celebrates 50 years of the [[CMA Awards]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/scenes-cmas-historic-music-video-featuring-30-country/story?id=42129062 |title=30 Country Music Stars Join Forces for Historic CMA Music Video |date=September 22, 2016 |publisher=ABC News |access-date=September 29, 2019}}</ref>

Travis was arrested in February 2012, when he was found in a parked car outside of a church in [[Sanger, Texas]], with an open bottle of wine and smelling of alcohol.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31749_162-57372021-10391698/randy-travis-arrested-for-public-intoxication/ |title=Randy Travis arrested for public intoxication |last=Moraski |first=Lauren |date=February 6, 2012 |access-date=July 9, 2013 |publisher=[[CBS News]]}}</ref> Travis's Chrysalis Ranch is outside [[Tioga, Texas]], about {{convert|20|mi}} from Sanger.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://abc7.com/archive/8533112/ |title=Randy Travis Arrested near Church, for Public Intoxication |last=Heller |first=Corine |website=Abc7.com |access-date=December 12, 2016}}</ref>

On August 7, 2012, state troopers in [[Grayson County, Texas]], responded to a call that an unclothed man was lying in the road. Troopers reported that they arrived to find Travis unclothed and smelling of alcohol.<ref name="cnn-2012">{{Cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/08/justice/texas-randy-travis-arrest/index.html |title=Country singer Randy Travis arrested, accused of DWI |last1=Martinez |first1=Michael |date=August 8, 2012 |publisher=[[CNN]] |access-date=August 8, 2012 |last2=Arioto, David}}</ref> The Texas Highway Patrol said that Travis crashed his car in a construction zone, and that when they attempted to apprehend him, Travis threatened the lives of the troopers. Travis was subsequently arrested for driving while intoxicated and terroristic threat against a public servant. He posted bail in the amount of $21,500.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/09/randy-travis-arrested |title=Randy Travis arrested after trying to buy cigarettes while naked |last=Michaels |first=Sean |date=August 9, 2012 |website=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> Earlier in the same evening, just prior to the DUI arrest, Travis allegedly walked into a Tiger Mart convenience store naked, demanding cigarettes from the cashier, who in turn called the authorities. According to the store clerk, Travis left the store upon realizing he did not have any money to pay for the cigarettes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Country/2012/08/13/20096771-wenn-story.html |title=Nude Travis demanded smokes? |date=August 13, 2012 |url-status=dead |access-date=March 13, 2021 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130115095018/http://jam.canoe.ca/Country/2012/08/13/20096771-wenn-story.html |archive-date=January 15, 2013}}</ref>

Travis filed a lawsuit to block police dash cam video of the incident from being released. After a 5-year legal battle, a judge ruled that the video did not violate his right to privacy, and the video was released to the public in December 2017.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://abc7chicago.com/entertainment/video-of-randy-travis-naked-2012-arrest-released/2741367/ |title=Video of Randy Travis' naked 2012 arrest released |date=December 5, 2017 |publisher=ABC7 Chicago |access-date=November 5, 2019}}</ref>

In 2016, it was reported he recovered his voice after about three years of rehabilitation and therapy, and could perform again.
