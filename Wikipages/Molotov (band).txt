'''Molotov''' is a Mexican [[rock en español]] band formed in [[Mexico City]] in 1995. Their lyrics, which are rapped and sung by all members of the group, feature [[Spanglish|a mixture of Spanish and English]]. The band members also switch instruments and roles depending on what song they are performing.

==Biography==
[[File:Molotov in Managua, Nicaragua.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Molotov in November 2006]]
The band began in 1995 when two friends, Tito Fuentes (guitar) and Micky "Chicho" Huidobro (bass), started playing together. [[Jay de la Cueva|Javier de la "J" Cueva]] and Iván Jared "La Quesadillera" Moreno joined them in September of that year, becoming the first line up for the band. Moreno would eventually leave and be replaced by Randy Ebright, the only American member of the band, in October 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dallasobserver.com/music/molotov-20-years-of-swear-words-and-latin-grammys-7080074|publisher=Dallas Observer|title=Molotov: 20 Years of Swear Words and Latin Grammys|first=Daryl|last=Smyers|date=5 August 2013|access-date=4 April 2019}}</ref> In February 1996, de la Cueva would also leave. He was replaced by Paco Ayala, establishing the four-member lineup that has remained consistent over the years.

Throughout 1996, the band played in many underground locations in [[Mexico City]] and began to gain a small group of fans. More success came when they opened for [[Héroes del Silencio]] in [[Monterrey]] and later for [[La Lupita]] in [[Puebla]]. During a concert at which they opened for Illya Kuryaki and The Valderramas, talent scouts from [[Universal Music Latin Entertainment]] offered them a record deal. It was a difficult period, with the band having to sell cassettes during their concerts while they prepared their debut album.

In July 1997, they released their debut album ''[[¿Dónde Jugarán las Niñas?]]'' The album took its name partly from [[Maná]]'s album ''[[¿Dónde Jugarán los Niños?]]'' This generated controversy, with stores refusing to sell it because of its lyrics and cover. Molotov went out to the street to sell their discs as a form of protest. In 1998, they participated with the song "Payaso" in the album ''[[Volcán: Tributo a José José]]'' a tribute to legendary singer [[José José]].

In 1998, Molotov released ''[[Molomix]]'', an album with remixes of ''Donde Jugarán'', including a version of the classic Queen song "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]" titled "Rap, Soda y Bohemia", and a new song, "El Carnal de las estrellas", which attacks the Mexican television network [[Televisa]] as a response to its refusal to air the band's videos. In September 1999, ''[[Apocalypshit]]'' was released and the band toured Europe, including Russia, and were also a part of the 1999 [[Vans Warped Tour]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H8S0WdfdaJQC&q=1999+Vans+Warped+Tour+molotov&pg=PA4|publisher=CMJ News Music Report|title=Warped Tour Lineup to Include Cypress Hill, Blink 182, Sevendust, Others|page=4|date=5 April 1999|access-date=4 April 2019}}</ref> In 2001, after a couple of years of touring, they took a rest and contributed to the soundtrack of the film ''[[Y tu mamá también]]''. The soundtrack was nominated for a [[Grammy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/alfonso-cuaron|publisher=Grammy|title=Grammy|access-date=4 April 2019}}</ref>) They also worked on the soundtrack of the film ''Atlético San Pancho''.

Molotov were part of the 2000 Watcha Tour,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1122746/molotov-ozomatli-set-for-watcha-2000-tour/|publisher=Mtv|title=Molotov, Ozomatli Set For Watcha 2000 Tour|date=2 August 2000|access-date=4 April 2019}}</ref> which included 17 shows with [[Los Enanitos Verdes]], [[Aterciopelados]], [[Café Tacuba]], and [[A.N.I.M.A.L.]] In 2003, the band's new album, ''[[Dance and Dense Denso]]'', was released and featured the Grammy-winning single "[[Frijolero (song)|Frijolero]]", which became the band's biggest hit to date. In 2004, the band released ''[[Con Todo Respeto]],'' which consisted of covers of groups such as [[Misfits (band)|The Misfits]], [[Beastie Boys]], [[ZZ Top]], and [[Los Toreros Muertos]].

On January 18, 2007, Molotov's official website addressed a separation rumor, saying that it could neither be confirmed or denied but that more information would be coming soon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.molotov.com.mx/index/main.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-02-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219113224/http://www.molotov.com.mx/index/main.htm |archive-date=2007-02-19 }}</ref> A few weeks later, the band confirmed on its website that it would indeed be touring and posted dates starting on April 3 in [[Ventura, California]], and ending on April 15 in [[Dallas, Texas]]. Despite no official break-up update, many radio stations announced the tour as Molotov's last. Later that year, the band released the album ''Eternamiente'' (a [[portmanteau]] of ''eternamente'' [eternally] and ''miente'' [he lies]) with the hit song "Yofo". The album saw first-week sales of nearly 1,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xw4EAAAAMBAJ&q=molotov+Eternamiente&pg=PA16|publisher=Billboard|title=Rock Three Times|first=Aya Ben|last=Yehuda|page=16|date=10 November 2007|access-date=4 April 2019}}</ref>

Molotov performed at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival#2009–2011|2009 Coachella Music Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/269508/mccartney-killers-cure-anchor-coachella-lineup|publisher=Billboard|title=McCartney, Killers, Cure Anchor Coachella Lineup|first=Jonathan|last=Cohen|date=20 January 2009|access-date=4 April 2019}}</ref> In an interview, the band talked about the possibility of releasing a live DVD. In a later interview, Ebright said the DVD would possibly be directed by ''Y tu mamá también'' director [[Alfonso Cuaron]]. The band's manager, Jorge Mondragón, has said that a book would be published recounting their 15 years as a band.

Band lead guitar Tito Fuentes said that their next album would be released independently during 2010. On May 14, 2010, it was announced that the band would perform at Mexico City's [[Zócalo]] for the first time in the band's history, having been denied the chance to play the venue in their hometown five times before. The band performed a concert along with other bands such as [[Jaguares (rock band)|Jaguares]] and [[Maldita Vecindad]] to protest against Arizona's [[SB 1070]] law.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fnsnews.nmsu.edu/the-arizona-prairie-fire-spreads/|publisher=FNS|title=The Arizona Prairie Fire Spreads|date=16 May 2010|access-date=4 April 2019}}</ref> The band recorded their performance at the Creation of Peace Festival in [[Kazan]] in Russia. In May 2012, this was released as the live album ''[[Desde Rusia con amor]]'', with an accompanying DVD. The band worked with Mexican film director [[Olallo Rubio]], providing music for a documentary called ''Gimme the Power'' in which Rubio analyzes Mexico under the power of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]]. The documentary was released on June 1, 2012.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2169326/</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.holamexicoff.com/films/gimme-power |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-11-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130125222136/http://www.holamexicoff.com/films/gimme-power |archive-date=2013-01-25 }}</ref>

==Music and lyrics==

Molotov's lyrics include a mixture of politics, sex, and expletives with dark humor and social commentary<ref name=BushApocalypshit/> which made it hard for Molotov to enter mainstream media. LGBT organization [[GLAAD]] criticized the band for their song "Puto", which GLAAD categorized as being homophobic. Molotov's lead vocalist and guitarist Tito Fuentes responded to the controversy over the song by stating, "It’s about cowards not homosexuals," further elaborating in regard to their lyricism, "We don’t [care] about being politically correct. We respect the art of it.  The expression."<ref name=Garcia/>

Publications such as ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' said that their music "is incendiary by nature [...] with poisoned darts aimed directly at the heart of the oppressive paternalism of the government".<ref name=Weingarten>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lywEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA120 |title=Molotov and Plastilina Mosh - The revolutionaries |last=Weingarten |first=Marc |work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]] |pages=120–121 |date=September 1998 |access-date=May 8, 2015}}</ref> For example, the song "Gimme Tha Power" contained a line that literally translated to, "We have to rip out the problem by the roots and change the government of our country." These lyrics reflected aspects of the tumultuous political climate of the late 1990s. In 2000, the [[Politics of Mexico|voting public in Mexico]] elected a president from a different political party than that which had held uninterrupted power since 1940.

==In popular culture==
