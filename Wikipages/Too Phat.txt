==Career==
{{Expand section|Critical reception, musical styles, early life of performers|date=January 2011}}
In the late 1990s Joe Flizzow, Malique and Kevin Felix @ Doctah'K at that time formed a musical trio who later became a duo under the [[Positive Tone]] label. Their first big break came in 1999 when their first singles, ''Li'l Fingaz'' and ''Too Phat Baby'' entered normal rotation on local radio.

On the back of the success of these first singles, work soon began on an album entitled ''whuttadilly?''. So far, ''Plan B'' has sold over 4,500,000 copies, earning double platinum status in Malaysia.

The music video for a track from ''Plan B'', "Just a Friend", was produced in collaboration with Maxis Hotlink and debuted on Malaysian television channel [[NTV7]]. The video features cameo appearances from local artistes [[M. Nasir]], [[Fauziah Latiff]] and [[Ferhad]], and Malaysian [[track and field]] athlete [[Watson Nyambek]]. Most of the scenes were shot locally, in the city of Kuala Lumpur. The group controversially used their video to confront issues regarding homosexuality, addressing a topic which is usually avoided in conservative Malaysia. Too Phat have also collaborated with American hip hop artist [[Warren G]].

In 2005, they produced their fourth and last studio album ''Rebirth into Reality'' featuring various hip-hop artists from East Asia. The album's first single ''Dua Dunia'' features award-winning Malaysian singer [[Siti Nurhaliza]]. The duo went on indefinite hiatus with Malique and Joe Flizzow pursue their solo careers.

In 2010, Too Phat reunited for a short period to promote their single, "Masih Hip Hop".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.utusan.com.my/hiburan/hiphop-yang-berliku-1.58017|title=Hip hop yang berliku|author=Muhammad Azrul Mohd Radi|publisher=[[Utusan Malaysia]]|date=10 February 2015|accessdate=16 February 2015|language=ms|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505035558/http://www.utusan.com.my/hiburan/hiphop-yang-berliku-1.58017|archive-date=5 May 2016}}</ref>
