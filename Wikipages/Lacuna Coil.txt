'''Lacuna Coil''' is an Italian [[gothic metal]] band from [[Milan]]. Since their formation in 1994, the group has had two name changes, being previously known as '''Sleep of Right''' and '''Ethereal''',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://events.pe.com/beaumont_tx/events/show/306015525-sevendust-with-lacuna-coil-and-avatar |title=Sevendust with Lacuna Coil and Avatar at Dixie Dance Hall |publisher=Events.PE}}</ref> and they have recorded nine studio albums, two extended plays, two live albums, two compilation albums, one video album, and sixteen singles and music videos.

Inspired by the combination of [[Gothic aesthetics|gothic]] imagery and music, the members have been known, musically, for composing mid-tempo songs consisting of prominent guitar lines and contrasting dual female/male vocal harmonies to help create a melodic, detached sound. Much of the band's recent material, however, sees a heavier and more down-tuned style, featuring a more distinct bass line and a higher mixing of the guitars within the songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/reviews/details.cfm?releaseid=246 |title=Lacuna Coil - "Karmacode" CD Review - in Metal Reviews |publisher=Metal Underground.com |access-date=June 10, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blistering.com/fastpage/fpengine.php/link/1/templateid/11535/tempidx/4/menuid/2 |title=Review: Lacuna Coil - Karmacode |publisher=Blistering.com |date=November 22, 2007 |access-date=June 10, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325124723/http://www.blistering.com/fastpage/fpengine.php/link/1/templateid/11535/tempidx/4/menuid/2 |archive-date=March 25, 2012 }}</ref>

They have toured internationally and were nominated in 2006 for a [[MTV Europe Music Award for Best Italian Act|MTV Europe Music Award]]. They won the 2012 [[Metal Female Voices Fest]] Award for the Best Album, the 2016 Metal Hammer Award for the Best International Band, and the 2018 [[Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards|Metal Hammer Golden Gods Award]] for Best Live Act. The band's 2012 release, ''[[Dark Adrenaline]]'', peaked at number 15 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. As of March 2012, Lacuna Coil have sold over two million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reflectionsofdarkness.com/artists-p-t-concertreviews-156/13630-live-review-paradise-lost-herford-2013|title=Live Review: Paradise Lost - Herford 2013|publisher=Reflections of Darkness}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation and debut EP (1994–1998)===
Vocalist [[Andrea Ferro]] and bassist/composer Marco Coti Zelati formed '''Sleep of Right''' in Milan, Italy, 1994,{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} and recruited Raffaele Zagaria on guitars, and Michaelangelo Algardi on the drums. After recording a song titled "Bleeding Souls" for the ''Noise of Bolgia'' compilation in 1995, Claudio Leo became the band's second guitarist, and Leonardo Forti replaced Michaelangelo on the drums after his departure. The band asked [[Cristina Scabbia]], a friend and girlfriend of Marco at the time, to sing background vocals briefly, which led to her officially joining the band. Soon after, the band changed their name to '''Ethereal''', and signed to [[Century Media Records|Century Media]] at the end of 1997. Finding that the name Ethereal was already taken by a Greek band, they changed their name to Lacuna Coil, meaning "empty spiral."<ref name=spyral>{{cite web|url=http://www.emptyspiral.net/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=95 |title=Emptyspiral.net - The Lacuna Coil Community |access-date=January 14, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927122948/http://www.emptyspiral.net/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=95 |archive-date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref>

Lacuna Coil released a self-titled [[extended play|EP]] through Century Media in 1998, shortly after Raffael Zagaria, Claudio Leo, and Leonardo Forti departed. As a result, guitarist Cristiano Migliore and drummer Cristiano Mozzati were recruited officially. At this point, the band was touring with [[Moonspell]] after the release of the [[Lacuna Coil (EP)|''Lacuna Coil EP'']].

===''In a Reverie'' (1998–2000)===
Following a second European tour, the band recorded their debut full-length album ''[[In a Reverie]]'' and added second guitarist Marco Biazzi. The band supported the album with another European tour, co-headlining with [[Skyclad (band)|Skyclad]]. [[Allmusic]] rated the album 4 stars, saying it was "a fine debut by a band that bears watching." The band toured mostly around Europe, generally as a support act.

===''Halflife'' EP and ''Unleashed Memories'' (2000–2002)===
Following their debut, ''In a Reverie'', the EP ''[[Halflife (EP)|Half-Life]]'' was released in 2000 with five songs: "Half Life," "Hyperfast," "Stars" (a cover of a [[Dubstar]] single), "Trance Awake" and a demo version of "Senzafine." The final version of the latter was included in the 2001 album ''[[Unleashed Memories]]''. While the studio album contained 10 songs, later re-releases included the ''Halflife'' EP. That same year, the band toured the United States for the first time, supporting [[Moonspell]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/moonspell-frontman-comments-on-nocturnal-mourning-tour/|title=MOONSPELL Frontman Comments On 'Nocturnal Mourning' Tour|date=June 19, 2006|website=BLABBERMOUTH.NET}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.emptyspiral.net/features/lacuna-coil-biography/|title=Lacuna Coil Biography|date=December 23, 2011}}</ref>

[[Image:Lacuna Coil Mera luna 2005.jpg|thumb|[[Cristina Scabbia]] (left) and [[Andrea Ferro]] (right) performing at the 2005 [[M'era Luna Festival]]]]
The band's breakthrough album ''[[Comalies]]'' was released in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|author=Andy Hinds |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/comalies-mw0000226154 |title=Comalies - Lacuna Coil &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=October 29, 2002 |access-date=June 28, 2016}}</ref> A significant player on Europe's metal scene for nearly a decade at this point, the band was virtually unknown in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.411mania.com/music/album_reviews/39395 |title=Music - Lacuna Coil – Karmacode Review |publisher=411mania.com |date=April 4, 2006 |access-date=June 10, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729084003/http://www.411mania.com/music/album_reviews/39395 |archive-date=July 29, 2009 }}</ref> The TV series ''[[Uranium (TV series)|Uranium]]'' gave the band some of its earliest US exposure; over a year later, the first single from ''Comalies'', "[[Heaven's a Lie]]," began to receive radio and media attention, pulling the band into North America's musical mainstream. They kicked off their first headlining U.S. tour in 2003, supported by [[Dog Fashion Disco]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacunacoil.it/biography/ |title=Biography |publisher=Lacunacoil.it |access-date=February 15, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325121422/http://www.lacunacoil.it/biography/ |archive-date=March 25, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apeshit.org/news/lacuna-coil-return-to-headline-us-tour/ |title=LACUNA COIL Return To Headline US Tour &#124; News |publisher=Apeshit |date=November 11, 2003 |access-date=February 15, 2013}}</ref> Networks such as Fuse played the song's video, for example.

The second single, "[[Swamped (song)|Swamped]]," was played in heavy rotation and used in the video game ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines]]''. It also appeared on the soundtrack for the movie ''[[Resident Evil: Apocalypse]]''. Videos were filmed for both songs and broadcast on [[MTV2]]'s ''[[Headbangers Ball]]'', which also saw the band perform an acoustic rendition of "Heaven's a Lie" live.

By 2004, ''Comalies'' had become the best-selling CD in [[Century Media]]'s history. The band appeared at [[Ozzfest]] in between headlining club tours in the United States and Europe. A bonus, extended version of ''Comalies'' was released both in stores and on iTunes. This version consisted of both live and acoustic versions of the songs "Heaven's A Lie," "Swamped," "Unspoken," "Aeon" and "Senzafine" from ''Unleashed Memories''.

===''Karmacode'' (2006–2008)===
The band and label postponed the release of their follow-up to ''Comalies'', ''[[Karmacode]]'', to early 2006. According to the band's website, this made it possible for more time to be spent on production and to avoid the crowded summer 2005 release schedule for metal albums. On December 23, 2005 the band announced on their web site that all recording, mixing, and mastering on ''Karmacode'' had been completed. It was then announced that ''Karmacode'' would be released in the United States on April 4, 2006.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

After their tour with Zombie, they performed main stage at [[Ozzfest]] 2006 along with [[System of a Down]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], and [[Hatebreed]], becoming the first female-fronted band to co-headline the heavy-metal festival. That summer they also played on the main stage of the [[Download Festival]] (a three-day music festival in England's [[Donington Park]]), which was headlined by [[Metallica]], [[Tool (band)|Tool]], and [[Guns N' Roses]]. That December, Lacuna Coil teamed up with In Flames, The Sword and Seemless for a US tour, as well as The Blackest of the Black 2006 Tour.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Four singles were officially released from ''Karmacode'': "[[Our Truth]]," "[[Closer (Lacuna Coil song)|Closer]]," "[[Within Me]]" and a cover of [[Depeche Mode]]'s "[[Enjoy the Silence (Lacuna Coil song)|Enjoy the Silence]]." "[[Our Truth]]" was the first single released and had a music video produced for it. The song was featured on the ''[[Underworld: Evolution]]'' soundtrack and entered the top forty on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock]] chart in the United States.<ref name="billboard1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/lacuna-coil |title=Lacuna Coil: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |access-date=June 10, 2010}}</ref>

The band toured extensively to support the album throughout 2007. This included the [[Jägermeister Music Tour]], The Hottest Chicks in Metal Tour 2007, [[Loudpark Festival]] '07 in [[Saitama City]]'s [[Saitama Super Arena]], and the Australian leg of [[Megadeth]]'s [[Gigantour]].

Lacuna Coil's first live DVD was released in November 2008, entitled ''[[Visual Karma (Body, Mind and Soul)]]''. The CD/DVD package is a retrospective of all things from the band's ''[[Karmacode]]'' album cycle. The set list features concerts filmed at Germany's [[Wacken Festival]] and at the Japanese [[Loudpark Festival]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centurymedia.com/us/news.php?artist_ID%3D31 |title=LACUNA COIL To Perform Acoustic On Fox 25 Morning News |access-date=February 8, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407101835/http://www.centurymedia.com/us/news.php?artist_ID=31 |archive-date=April 7, 2007 }}</ref>

[[File:Lacuna Coil 2010 0001.jpg|thumb|Lacuna Coil performing in Chile in June 2010]]
In 2008, it was announced that Lacuna Coil's fifth studio album would be produced by Don Gilmore and would include some [[Arabia|Arabic]] influences. [[Cristina Scabbia]] explained in the magazine [[Rock Sound]]: "It's different, but it's our style. We haven't done anything absolutely different from our style, because that wouldn't be natural, that would be weird - it wouldn't be us. The songs are definitely more powerful, more complete, more intense, more straight-to-the-point." [[Andrea Ferro]] said: "We've put more attention on the real meaning of the songs, so the vocals are a bit more prominent. We've worked a lot with Don Gilmore on the pronunciation of the words in English, so people really understand the meanings of the words. There are strong choruses, where people can relate and really understand what we mean."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/BLABBERMOUTH.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=110811|title=LACUNA COIL Discusses 'Shallow Life' Album Concept, Working With LINKIN PARK Producer|date=Dec 14, 2008|access-date=October 12, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606064349/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/BLABBERMOUTH.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=110811|archive-date=June 6, 2011}}</ref>
