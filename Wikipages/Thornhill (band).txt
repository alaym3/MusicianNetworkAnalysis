== History ==

=== Foundation and early years (2015–2017) ===
The band had its initial beginnings in 2015<ref>{{Citation|title=Get To Know: Thornhill|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQi-2DyrOsU|language=en|access-date=2021-04-13}}</ref> when Jacob Charlton, Ben Maida, Sam Anderson and Ethan McCann began performing in Battle of the Bands competitions<ref name=":1">{{Citation|title=Get To Know: Thornhill|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQi-2DyrOsU|language=en|access-date=2021-04-15}}</ref> whilst at high-school at [[Vermont Secondary College]] in outer suburban [[Melbourne]]. During this period the band described [[The Amity Affliction|Amity Affliction]], [[Muse (band)|Muse]] and [[Northlane]] as important musical influences. 

The band's first formal release occurred in 2016 with debut single ''XY'' on 2 June 2016, featuring [[Void of Vision]]'s Jack Bergin.<ref>{{Cite web|title=XY (Ft.

After a positive critical reception to ''13'' and ''Temperer'',<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Best Tracks of 2017 (so far) according to our Super Users!|url=https://www.triplejunearthed.com/article/best-tracks-2017-so-far-according-our-super-users|access-date=2021-04-16|website=triple j Unearthed|language=en}}</ref> the band toured as support acts for several Australian local metal bands including [[Void of Vision]] and [[Hellions (band)|Hellions]].
