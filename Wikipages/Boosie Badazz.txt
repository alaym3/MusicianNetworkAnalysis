Shortly after, it was reported that he may have to get his leg amputated. On November 22, Boosie stated he was at home healing with no amputations.

=== Controversies ===
In February 2020, Boosie was criticized for comments he made towards Zaya Wade, 12-year-old daughter of American basketball player [[Dwyane Wade]], who had recently come out as [[Transgender youth|transgender]], with the support of her parents, among them being "Don't cut his dick off, bruh."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/9325021/boosie-badazz-dwyane-wade-transphobic-comments|title=Boosie Badazz Stands Firm on Transphobic Comments About Dwyane Wade's son Zaya}}</ref> In the same video, he went on to complain that children had too much power, and about [[corporal punishment]] being illegal.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Boosie Badazz Doubles Down on Comments Aimed at Dwyane Wade's Daughter Zaya|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2020/03/boosie-badazz-doubles-down-comments-aimed-dwyane-wade-zaya|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=May 19, 2020}}</ref>

Also in February 2020, just days after the incident involving Zaya Wade, Boosie was asked by staff to leave a [[Planet Fitness]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]; Boosie alleged the gym's manager was hostile towards him for his comments towards Wade but a spokesperson for the company denied Boosie's claim that a personal grudge was the reason for his being asked to leave, instead stating that the rapper had failed to comply with company policies and had harassed members of the staff.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://allhiphop.com/news/planet-fitness-admits-boosie-was-kicked-out-of-gym-accuses-rapper-of-harassment-LoCMYUkNyEuywPB5gckWRw|title=Planet Fitness Admits Boosie Was Kicked Out Of Gym; Accuses Rapper Of Harassment}}</ref>

In May 2020, Boosie came under fire for a now-deleted video he'd uploaded to [[Instagram]] in which he spoke positively of paying an adult woman to perform oral sex on his son and nephew, then 12 and 13 years old, below the age of consent in any U.S. state,  and allowing his minor son to watch [[pornography]], as he felt pornography was more appropriate for children to watch than "cartoons with two men kissing."<ref>{{cite web|title=Boosie Badazz Faces Backlash After Claiming He Got 'Grown Woman' to Give His Underage Son Oral Sex|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2020/05/boosie-badazz-backlash-claims-he-got-his-underage-son-nephew-oral-sex-from-woman}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Boosie Badazz Faces Backlash After Claiming He Got 'Grown Woman' to Give His Underage Son Oral Sex|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2020/05/boosie-badazz-backlash-claims-he-got-his-underage-son-nephew-oral-sex-from-woman|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=May 14, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Rapper Boosie Badazz claims he paid for sex for 14-year-old son|url=https://nypost.com/2020/05/13/boosie-badazz-claims-he-paid-for-sex-for-14-year-old-son/|last=Weiss|first=Suzy|date=May 13, 2020|website=New York Post|language=en|access-date=May 14, 2020}}</ref> Previously in 2017, in a birthday post aimed at his soon-to-be 14-year-old son, Boosie bragged that he had secured his son a "bad bitch" to perform fellatio on him for his birthday, in a post liked by 27,000 users, though he later claimed he'd been joking, after public backlash occurred.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Here's What Boosie Has to Say About Offering His Son Oral Sex for His Birthday|url=https://www.bet.com/music/2017/08/07/boosie-badazz-son-head.html?cid=facebook|website=BET.com|access-date=May 19, 2020}}</ref>
