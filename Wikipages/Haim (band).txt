In addition to their primary instruments, each is proficient in several others. The group's pop sound on their studio work stands in contrast to the more rock-based music of their live shows.

The sisters grew up in a musical family, and began playing instruments from an early age in the [[cover band]] Rockinhaim, fronted by their parents, [[Mordechai Haim|Moti]] and Donna. The two elder sisters, Este and Danielle, began performing with the pop group Valli Girls in 2005. They released a few songs on soundtrack and compilation albums under that name, but left the group shortly after an appearance at the 2005 [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.thefader.com/2013/06/25/haim-best-friends-forever |title=Haim: Best Friends Forever |work=The FADER |access-date=October 19, 2017 |language=en |archive-date=October 19, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019164942/http://www.thefader.com/2013/06/25/haim-best-friends-forever |url-status=live }}</ref> They formed Haim with younger sister Alana in 2007, but did not seriously consider it a professional career for some years. After Danielle became a successful touring guitarist, first with [[Jenny Lewis]] and later with [[Julian Casablancas]], Haim reformed as a full-time operation in 2012.

The group's first release, ''Forever'' (an EP released as a limited-time download), combined with positive reception at the [[South by Southwest]] festival, led to a deal with [[Polydor Records]] and a management deal with [[Jay-Z]]'s [[Roc Nation]] group in mid-2012. The band began recording material for their first album, ''[[Days Are Gone]]'', in sessions between touring dates, including appearances at the [[Glastonbury Festival]]. The album charted in the top ten in several countries, including the number-one spot in the UK, and the group had won several "best of" awards by the end of 2013. The group was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] at the [[57th Annual Grammy Awards]]. Their second album, ''[[Something to Tell You]]'', was released in July 2017.<ref name="nyt">{{cite news |last=Reznick |first=Melissa |date=July 6, 2017 |title=Haim Wants to Prove That Vintage Vibes Feel Just Fine Now |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/arts/music/haim-something-to-tell-you-interview.html |work=New York Times |location=New York |access-date=July 6, 2017 |archive-date=July 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706163157/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/arts/music/haim-something-to-tell-you-interview.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Their third album, titled ''[[Women in Music Pt.

The three sisters, Este Arielle Haim (born March 14, 1986), Danielle Sari Haim (born February 16, 1989) and Alana Mychal Haim (born December 15, 1991) were all born and raised in the [[San Fernando Valley]], [[California]], U.S., to [[Jewish]] parents.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thejc.com/news/world-news/96586/jewish-singers-haim-tipped-sound-2013 |title=Jewish singers Haim tipped as Sound of 2013 |newspaper=The Jewish Chronicle |access-date=November 2, 2013 |archive-date=July 9, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709124422/http://www.thejc.com/news/world-news/96586/jewish-singers-haim-tipped-sound-2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Their [[Israel]]i-born father [[Mordechai Haim|Mordechai "Moti" Haim]] and their American mother Donna were both musical; though he had been a professional soccer player in Israel, Moti also played drums, while Donna won a contest on ''[[The Gong Show]]'' in the 1970s singing a [[Bonnie Raitt]] song.<ref name="salon">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.spin.com/featured/haim-spin-2013-october-cover-story |title=Falling for Haim |magazine=Spin |first=Camille |last=Dodero |date=September 30, 2013 |access-date=October 21, 2014 |archive-date=October 17, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017033204/http://www.spin.com/featured/haim-spin-2013-october-cover-story/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Vogue"/><ref name="lester"/> Their father's maternal Jewish family is originally from [[Bulgarian Jews|Bulgaria]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/haim-fashion-dior-guggenheim-gala|title = The Haim Sisters: "I Don't Know if You Can Tell, but We're a Fortress"}}</ref> While Danielle showed an aptitude for the guitar at a young age, Moti made the decision that Este would be more suited to the bass, buying her a second-hand [[Fender bass|Fender]] for $50.<ref name="weiner"/> The siblings were encouraged to listen to their parents' 1970s [[classic rock]] and [[Americana (music)|Americana]] records and, during their childhood, the family formed a band called Rockinhaim to play cover versions at local charity fairs, with Moti on drums and Donna on guitar.<ref name="Vogue" /><ref name="Guardian20121124" /><ref name="Interview">{{cite web |first=Emma |last=Brown |title=Discovery: HAIM |work=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] |date=February 8, 2012 |url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/discovery-haim |access-date=December 12, 2012 |archive-date=January 3, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103054128/http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/discovery-haim |url-status=live }}</ref> The group played typical wedding band material, including [[the Beatles]]' "[[Get Back]]", [[Billy Joel]]'s "[[You May Be Right (song)|You May Be Right]]" and [[Van Morrison]]'s "[[Brown Eyed Girl]]",<ref name="Evening Standard"/> but only did free community and benefit gigs at churches, schools and hospitals.<ref name="salon"/>

As they grew older, the sisters became more interested in incorporating pop and [[contemporary R&B]] into their music, and in 2007 they decided to form their own band.<ref name="weiner">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/how-haims-three-geeky-sisters-became-the-years-coolest-new-band-20131112 |title=How Haim's Three Geeky Sisters Became the Year's Coolest New Band |first=Jonah |last=Weiner |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=November 12, 2013 |access-date=October 20, 2014 |archive-date=October 22, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022083348/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/how-haims-three-geeky-sisters-became-the-years-coolest-new-band-20131112 |url-status=live }}</ref> For their first gig, the trio played at a Jewish deli in Hollywood and were paid in matzah ball soup.<ref name="Independent">{{cite news |first=Barry |last=Egan |title=Music: Haim – Sisters of super sounds |newspaper=The Independent |url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/music-haim-sisters-of-super-sounds-29739021.html |date=November 10, 2013 |access-date=May 19, 2014 |archive-date=May 25, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525234316/http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/music-haim-sisters-of-super-sounds-29739021.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Early gigs were sparsely populated; Danielle recalled, "We were [at the] bottom of the bill at 50-capacity venues and no one would show up".<ref name="mccormick"/>

For the next five years, Haim played local venues but did not consider music as a professional career, because all three sisters were busy with other projects.

In her survey of pop music in 2013, ''[[The Observer|Observer]]'' critic [[Kitty Empire]] praised the band for "using the vector of harmonies to splice R&B with 1970s soft rock. They laid waste, too, to a herd of ghastly old hobby horses about guitar bands being unmarketable and record sales only being tied to women's state of undress."<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/dec/22/best-pop-music-2013-review| title = The best pop of 2013: Kitty Empire's choice| author = Empire, Kitty| date = December 22, 2013| access-date = January 6, 2013| newspaper = The Guardian| archive-date = December 22, 2013| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131222221548/http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/dec/22/best-pop-music-2013-review| url-status = live}}</ref> ''[[The Independent]]'' was more ambivalent about the band, saying there was "an insubstantiality at their core" of their music, as they "plug unashamedly" into the heritage of acts such as [[Fleetwood Mac]] and [[The Bangles]], ultimately finding Haim as "Okay, but not much more".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/album-review-haim-days-are-gone-polydor-8842277.html|title=Album review: Haim, Days Are Gone (Polydor) |work=[[The Independent]] |last=Gill |first=Andy |date=September 30, 2013 |access-date=October 3, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003115200/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/album-review-haim-days-are-gone-polydor-8842277.html |archive-date=October 3, 2013}}</ref>
