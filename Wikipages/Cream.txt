[[File:Milk-bottle.jpg|thumb|275px|A bottle of unhomogenised milk, with the cream clearly visible, resting on top of the milk]]
'''Cream''' is a [[dairy product]] composed of the higher-fat layer skimmed from the top of [[milk]] before [[Homogenization (chemistry)|homogenization]]. In un-homogenized milk, the fat, which is less dense, eventually rises to the top. In the industrial production of cream, this process is accelerated by using [[centrifuge]]s called "[[Separator (milk)|separator]]s". In many countries, it is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content. It can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets, and contains high levels of [[saturated fat]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/everyone/basics/fat/saturatedfat.html|title=Nutrition for Everyone: Basics: Saturated Fat - DNPAO - CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=16 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140129222042/http://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/everyone/basics/fat/saturatedfat.html|archive-date=29 January 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/Eat-less-saturated-fat.aspx|title=Eat less saturated fat - Live Well - NHS Choices|first=NHS|last=Choices|website=www.nhs.uk|access-date=16 June 2017}}</ref>

Cream skimmed from milk may be called "sweet cream" to distinguish it from cream skimmed from [[whey]], a [[by-product]] of [[cheese]]-making. Whey cream has a lower fat content and tastes more salty, tangy and "cheesy".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oukosher.org/index.php/common/article/everything_is_in_butter/|title="Everything Is In Butter" - Kosher|date=8 June 2013|access-date=16 June 2017}}</ref> In many countries, cream is usually sold partially fermented: [[sour cream]], [[crème fraîche]], and so on.  Both forms have many culinary uses in sweet, bitter, salty and tangy dishes.

Cream produced by [[cattle]] (particularly [[Jersey cattle]]) grazing on natural [[pasture]] often contains some natural [[carotenoid]] pigments derived from the [[plant]]s they eat; this gives it a slightly yellow tone, hence the name of the yellowish-white color: [[cream (color)|cream]]. This is also the origin of [[butter]]'s yellow color. Cream from [[goat]]'s milk, water buffalo milk, or from cows fed indoors on grain or grain-based pellets, is white.

==Cuisine==
[[File:Merry christmas!.jpg|thumb|250px|Christmas cake covered with whipping cream]]
Cream is used as an ingredient in many foods, including [[ice cream]], many [[sauce]]s, [[soup]]s, stews, puddings, and some [[custard]] bases, and is also used for [[cake]]s. [[Whipped cream]] is served as a topping on ice cream [[sundae]]s, [[milkshake]]s, [[lassi]], [[eggnog]], sweet [[pie]]s, strawberries, blueberries or peaches. [[Irish cream]] is an alcoholic liqueur which blends cream with [[whiskey]], and often [[honey]], [[wine]], or coffee. Cream is also used in Indian curries such as masala dishes.

Cream (usually light/single cream or [[half and half]]) is often added to [[coffee]] in the US and Canada.

Both single and double cream (see [[Cream#Types|Types]] for definitions) can be used in cooking. Double cream or full-fat crème fraîche are often used when cream is added to a hot sauce, to prevent any problem with it separating or "splitting". Double cream can be thinned with milk to make an approximation of single cream.

The French word ''crème'' denotes not only dairy cream, but also other thick liquids such as sweet and savory [[custard]]s, which are normally made with milk, not cream.<ref>''[[Larousse Gastronomique]], 1938, translated 1961, p. 337</ref>

==Types ==

[[File:Stewed nectarines.JPG|thumb|right|Stewed [[nectarine]]s and heavy cream]]

Different grades of cream are distinguished by their fat content, whether they have been heat-treated, whipped, and so on. In many jurisdictions, there are regulations for each type.

===Australia and New Zealand===
The Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code – Standard 2.5.2 – Defines cream as a milk product comparatively rich in fat, in the form of an emulsion of fat-in-skim milk, which can be obtained by separation from milk. Cream sold without further specification must contain no less than 350 g/kg (35%) milk fat.<ref>{{cite act |title=Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code |type=Standard |number=2.5.2 |date=25 March 2015 |article=Proposal P1025 – Code Revision |articletype=Food Standards Variation |url= https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2015L00470 |access-date=2016-10-26}}</ref>

Manufacturers labels may distinguish between different fat contents, a general guideline is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|- 
! Name
! Fat Content
! Main Uses 
|- style="text-align: center;"
| Extra light (or 'lite')
| 12–12.5%
| 
|- style="text-align: center;"
| Light (or 'lite')
| 18–20%
|  
|- style="text-align: center;"
| Thickened Cream
| 35–36.5%
| Cream with added gelatine and/or other thickeners to give the cream a thicker texture, also possibly with stabilisers to aid the consistency of whipped cream. Such cream would not typically be used for cooking.
|- style="text-align: center;"
| Cream
| >= 35%
| Recipes calling for cream are usually referring to pure cream with about 35% fat. This is used for cooking as well as for pouring and whipping. It is comparable to ''whipping cream'' in some other countries.
|- style="text-align: center;"
| Double Cream
| 48–60%

=== Canada ===

Canadian cream definitions are similar to those used in the United States, except for "light cream", which is very low-fat cream, usually with 5 or 6 percent butterfat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dairygoodness.ca/cream/types-of-cream/5-or-6-light-cream-or-cream-and-milk-blend-for-coffee|title=5% or 6% Light Cream or Cream and Milk Blend for Coffee - Types of Cream - Cream - Dairy Goodness|first=Dairy Farmers of|last=Canada|website=www.dairygoodness.ca}}</ref> Specific product characteristics are generally uniform throughout Canada, but names vary by both geographic and linguistic area and by manufacturer: "coffee cream" may be 10 or 18 percent cream and "half-and-half" ("crème légère") may be 3, 5, 6 or 10 percent, all depending on location and brand.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bcdairy.ca/milk/articles/what-kind-of-cream-should-i-use|title=What Type of Cream Should I Use?|date=27 November 2016|access-date=16 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://metsdelacreme.com/lafamilledescremes/|title=Tout sur la fabrication de la crème et ses bienfaits - La Famille du lait|website=metsdelacreme.com|access-date=16 June 2017}}</ref>

Regulations allow cream to contain [[acidity regulator]]s and [[stabilizer (food)|stabilizer]]s. For whipping cream, allowed additives include skim milk powder (≤ 0.25%), glucose solids (≤ 0.1%), calcium sulphate (≤ 0.005%), and xanthan gum (≤ 0.02%).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._870/page-55.html#h-571830|title = Consolidated federal laws of canada, Food and Drug Regulations|date = 16 September 2021}}</ref> The content of milk fat in canned cream must be displayed as a percentage followed by "milk fat", "B.F", or "M.F".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._870/page-54.html#h-79|title=Consolidated federal laws of Canada, Food and Drug Regulations|last=Branch|first=Legislative Services|website=laws.justice.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-07-18}}</ref>

=== France ===
In France, the use of the term "cream" for food products is defined by the decree 80-313 of April 23, 1980.<ref>{{Citation|title=Décret n° 80-313 du 23 avril 1980 relatif aux crèmes de lait destinées à la consommation|date=1980-04-23|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000879692|access-date=2018-01-13}}</ref> It specifies the minimum rate of milk fat (12%) as well as the rules for [[Pasteurization|pasteurisation]] or [[Ultra-high-temperature processing|UHT sterilisation]]. The mention "crème fraîche" (fresh cream) can only be used for pasteurised creams conditioned on production site within 24h after pasteurisation. Even if food additives complying with French and European laws are allowed, usually, none will be found in plain "crèmes" and "crèmes fraîches" apart from lactic ferments (some low cost creams (or close to creams) can contain thickening agents, but rarely).{{cn|date=July 2019}} Fat content is commonly shown as "XX% M.G." ("matière grasse").

=== Russia ===
Russia, as well as other [[Eurasian Conformity mark|EAC countries]], legally separates cream into two classes: normal (10–34% butterfat) and heavy (35–58%),<ref name="EACDairy">[[Eurasian Customs Union]] Technical Requirements "[http://www.dairyunion.ru/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tex_reglament_moloko033.pdf On milk and dairy products safety]"</ref> but the industry has pretty much standardized around the following types:

===Sweden===
In [[Sweden]], cream is usually sold as:
*Matlagningsgrädde ("''cooking cream''"), 10–15 %
*Kaffegrädde ("''Coffee cream''"), 10-12 %, earlier mostly 12 %
*Vispgrädde (''whipping cream''), 36–40 %, the 36 % variant often has additives.

Mellangrädde (27%) is, nowadays, a less common variant. 
Gräddfil (usually 12 %) and Creme Fraiche (usually around 35 %) are two common sour cream products.

=== Switzerland ===
In Switzerland, the types of cream are legally defined<ref>{{cite swiss law | sr = 817.022.108 | link = 817_022_108 | art = 48 | date = 2010-11-23 | en = | enab = | de = Verordnung des EDI über Lebensmittel tierischer Herkunft | deab = | fr = Ordonnance du DFI sur les denrées alimentaires d'origine animale | frab = | it = Ordinanza del DFI sulle derrate alimentari di origine animale |es = | esab = | itab = }}</ref> as follows:

Thick cream (German: verdickter Rahm; French: crème épaissie; Italian: panna addensata) is defined as cream thickened using [[thickening agents]].

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, the types of cream are legally defined<ref>Food Labelling Regulations 1998</ref> as follows:

==Processing and additives==
Cream may have [[thickening agent]]s and [[Food additive|stabilizer]]s added. Thickeners include [[sodium alginate]], [[carrageenan]], [[gelatine]], [[sodium bicarbonate]], [[tetrasodium pyrophosphate]], and [[alginic acid]].<ref name=DairyFats>Dairy Fats and Related Products, edited by Adnan Tamime. This book has a great deal of technical information on cream and other dairy fat products. Extracts available on Google books [https://books.google.com/books?id=9h9dnGz7aP0C&lpg=PA296&ots=6Z3uB_hYUD&dq=cream%20alginate%20carrageenan%20-ice&pg=PA296#v=onepage&q=cream%20alginate%20carrageenan%20-ice&f=false]</ref>{{rp|296}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hispanagar.com/carrageenan.htm|title=Carrageenan: food thickener and gelling agent from Hispanagar|website=www.hispanagar.com|access-date=16 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180815191434/http://www.hispanagar.com/carrageenan.htm|archive-date=15 August 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Other processing may be carried out. For example, cream has a tendency to produce oily globules (called "feathering") when added to [[coffee]]. The stability of the cream may be increased by increasing the non-fat solids content, which can be done by partial demineralisation and addition of [[sodium caseinate]], although this is expensive.<ref name=DairyFats/>{{rp|297}}

==Other cream products==

[[File:Milkproducts v2.svg|thumb|275px|Chart of 50 types of milk products and relationships, including cream (click on image to enlarge)]]

{{nowrap|'''[[Butter]]''' is made}} by [[Churning (butter)|churning]] cream to separate the [[butterfat]] and [[buttermilk]]. This can be done by hand or by machine.

'''[[Whipped cream]]''' is made by [[whisk]]ing or [[mixer (cooking)|mixing]] [[air]] into cream with more than 30% fat, to turn the liquid cream into a soft solid. [[Nitrous oxide]], from [[whipped-cream charger]]s may also be used to make whipped cream.

'''[[Sour cream]]''', common in many countries including the U.S., Canada and Australia, is cream (12 to 16% or more milk fat) that has been subjected to a [[bacteria]]l culture that produces [[lactic acid]] (0.5%+), which [[souring|sours]] and thickens it.

'''[[Crème fraîche]]''' (28% milk fat) is slightly soured with bacterial culture, but not as sour or as thick as sour cream. Mexican '''[[Crema (dairy product)|crema]]''' (or '''cream espesa''') is similar to crème fraîche.

'''[[Smetana (cream)|Smetana]]''' is a heavy cream derived (15–40% milk fat) Central and Eastern European sweet or sour cream.

'''Rjome''' or '''rømme''' is [[Norway|Norwegian]] sour cream containing 35% milk fat, similar to [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] '''sýrður rjómi'''.

'''[[Clotted cream]]''', common in the United Kingdom, is made through a process that starts by slowly heating whole milk to produce a very high-fat (55%) product. This is similar to Indian '''[[malai]]'''.

'''[[Reduced cream]]''' is a cream product in New Zealand, often used to make [[Kiwi dip]].

==Other items called "cream"==
Some non-edible substances are called creams due to their consistency: shoe cream is runny, unlike regular waxy shoe polish;  hand/body "creme" or "skin cream" is meant for moisturizing the skin.

Regulations in many jurisdictions restrict the use of the word ''cream'' for foods. Words such as ''creme'', ''kreme'', ''creame'', or ''whipped topping'' (e.g., [[Cool Whip]]) are often used for products which cannot legally be called cream, though in some jurisdictions even these spellings may be disallowed, for example under the doctrine of ''[[idem sonans]]''.<ref>1952 Idaho Op. Atty. Gen. 20, cited in {{cite book|url=https://www.ag.idaho.gov/content/uploads/2017/12/1951-1952.pdf#page=33|last=Smylie|first=Robert E.|author-link=Robert E.

In some cases, foods can be described as cream although they do not contain predominantly milk fats; for example, in Britain, "[[ice cream]]" does not have to be a dairy product (although it must be labelled "contains non-milk fat") and [[salad cream]] is the customary name for a condiment that has been produced since the 1920s.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Ministry of Food.—statutory rules and orders|date=1 January 1945|journal=Analyst|volume=70|issue=833|pages=306–307|doi=10.1039/AN9457000306|bibcode=1945Ana....70..306.}}</ref>
