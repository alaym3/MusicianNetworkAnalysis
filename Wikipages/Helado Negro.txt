'''Roberto Carlos Lange''' (born 1980), better known by his stage name '''Helado Negro''', is an American musician. In 2019 he was awarded a [[United States Artists]] Fellow in Music<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unitedstatesartists.org/fellow/helado-negro/|title=United States Artists » Helado Negro|website=Unitedstatesartists.org|accessdate=April 16, 2019}}</ref> and also the recipient of a 2019 Grants to Artists award in Music from the [[Foundation for Contemporary Arts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foundationforcontemporaryarts.org/recipients/roberto-carlos-lange|title=Roberto Carlos Lange :: Foundation for Contemporary Arts|website=Foundationforcontemporaryarts.org|accessdate=April 16, 2019}}</ref> In 2015 he received a [[Joyce Foundation]] award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joycefdn.org/news/2015-joyce-awards-announced|title=2015 Joyce Awards Announced|website=The Joyce Foundation|accessdate=April 16, 2019}}</ref>

A South Florida native, born to Ecuadorian immigrants and based in Brooklyn, Roberto Carlos Lange's upbringing provides essential elements to his songwriting, including his consistently bilingual—English and Spanish—lyrics. Exploring the expressivity within intense states of being, Latinx identity, and pluralistic sensibilities, his music as Helado Negro is an engrossing statement achieved through lyrically personal and political avant-pop music. Since Helado Negro's 2009 debut album ''Awe Owe'', Lange has cultivated an untraditional approach to songcraft that places his voice on an adventurous musical impulse without shying away from familiar pop appreciation, through multiple projects under various aliases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unitedstatesartists.org/fellow/helado-negro/|title=United States Artists » Helado Negro|access-date=December 2, 2019}}</ref>

Helado Negro released his 2019 album ''[[This Is How You Smile]]'' through [[RVNG Intl.]], a Brooklyn-based music institution.

==Early life==
The son of Ecuadorean immigrants, Helado Negro (Roberto Carlos Lange) was born in South Florida in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joycefdn.org/staff/helado-negro-and-the-st-paul-chamber-orchestras-liquid-music-series|title=Helado Negro and the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra's Liquid Music Series|website=The Joyce Foundation|accessdate=April 16, 2019}}</ref> He grew up in [[Lauderhill, Florida|Lauderhill]] and [[Davie, Florida|Davie]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/entertainment/music/sf-helado-negro-pamm-20150506-story.html|title=A taste of Helado Negro|first=Ben|last=Crandell|website=Sun-Sentinel.com|accessdate=April 16, 2019}}</ref>

As a high school student during the early 1990s, Roberto Carlos Lange would stay up late watching "Liquid Television" on MTV. Intrigued by the experimental videos and animation he saw there, he "was fascinated by the mystery of how they were made, and was curious as to how to make them."<ref name="scad.edu">{{cite web|url=https://www.scad.edu/about/news-press-and-recognition/scad-alumnus-roberto-carlos-lange-makes-distinctive-visual-music|title=SCAD alumnus Roberto Carlos Lange makes distinctive visual music|website=Scad.edu|accessdate=April 16, 2019}}</ref>

In 1999 he enrolled at the [[Savannah College of Art and Design|Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD)]] in [[Savannah, Georgia]], to study Computer Art and Sound Design. His sound studies focused on installation, performance and experimental art. During his time at SCAD, he participated in experimental sound and art shows, and he began to develop his musical work by purchasing an [[Akai MPC|MPC]] sampler to create music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.connectsavannah.com/savannah/shiny-happy-people/Content?oid=3164782|title=SCAD alum Roberto Carlos Lange brings the bilingual, tinsel-clad world of Helado Negro to PULSE|first=Anna |last=Chandler|website=Connect Savannah|accessdate=April 16, 2019}}</ref> He graduated in 2003 with a B.F.A. in Computer Art from SCAD.<ref name="scad.edu"/>

In 2015, Helado released the single "Young, Latin and Proud" along with an animated-visual and lyric video. Lange describes the song as "It was as if I was singing my 6-year-old self a lullaby... It's about feeling a sense of pride and self-confidence, understanding that you're born into something and it's alright to feel good about it. Stereotypes and contradictions are built into identity and I think those are a strong current in both Latino and black identity in the U.S. today."<ref name="thefader.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2016/09/12/helado-negro-interview-private-energy|title=How Helado Negro Reinvented Himself By Embracing His Latino American Identity|last1=Fintoni|first1=Laurent|website=Thefader.com|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}</ref>

We're vulnerable and scared to share with people. I'm just sharing my own vulnerable shit. The hardest part is talking to somebody else about it. I'm the worst person to sum things up with words but the best [way] to sum it up is with music, you know?"<ref name="thefader.com" />

In 2019 he released his sixth studio album titled ''This Is How You Smile.'' "Roberto Carlos Lange's sixth and best album as Helado Negro deepens and expands upon the imagistic nature of his lyrics and cosmic synth-folk. It is a sublime, masterful piece of music."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/artists/28016-helado-negro/|title=Helado Negro – Albums, Songs, and News|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=December 1, 2019}}</ref>

==Visual and sound art==
In 2007 Lange collaborated with visual artist David Ellis to create "Trash Talk" for a [[Christian Marclay]] curated show at the ICA Philly. Sonic trash bags created by David Ellis rattled and bumped like a percussion team, put together out of garbage bags, cans, bottles, cardboard, plastic, paper, aluminum, tin, foam, wire, hardware, and electronics. The sequence was composed in collaboration with Roberto Lange.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theartblog.org/2007/09/weekly-update-icas-shows-noisy-and-still/|title=Weekly Update – ICA's shows, noisy and still|date=September 19, 2007|website=Theartblog.org|accessdate=April 16, 2019}}</ref> Together they collaborated on works that featured at Zoo Art Fair, NADA Art Fair, and Roebling Hall. Some of these pieces included : "All Purpose Primer" (2007),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq3619R-vdo|title=All Purpose Primer|date=February 27, 2008|accessdate=April 16, 2019|publisher=YouTube}}</ref> "Trash Talk (2007),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o-9qLj8e6I|title=David Ellis + Roberto Lange|date=8 July 2013|accessdate=16 April 2019|publisher=YouTube}}</ref> "Hell's Angel (2008),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvOlhq8upXM|title=Publico 2003–2008 (Part 2)|date=January 30, 2008|accessdate=April 16, 2019|publisher=YouTube}}</ref> and "Liberty".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.woostercollective.com/post/liberty-by-david-ellis-roberto-carlos-lange|title=Wooster Collective: Liberty By David Ellis + Roberto Carlos Lange|website=Wooster Collective|accessdate=April 16, 2019}}</ref>

The duo's collaborations extended into video as well, with Lange contributing the sonic score to several of Ellis's visual motion paintings; these pieces were created on-site including a commission by the clothing retailer Theory to create new works of art. Lange would sample and manipulate sound as it was being generated acoustically from Ellis's movements and incidental sounds while painting.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2DE153EF930A15750C0A96E9C8B63|title=PULSE; When There's No Such Thing as a Still Life|first=Karin|last=Nelson|website=Query.nytimes.com|accessdate=April 16, 2019}}</ref>

In 2009, Lange scored the collaborative work by Blu and Ellis called "combo".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uad17d5hR5s|title=COMBO a collaborative animation by Blu and David Ellis (2 times loop)|date=September 13, 2009|accessdate=April 16, 2019|publisher=YouTube}}</ref>

In 2011, Lange contributed a site-specific sound sculpture called "HVAC Music Box",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj4XS9tPZ-Q|title=HVAC Music Box|date=January 30, 2011|accessdate=April 16, 2019|publisher=YouTube}}</ref> for the "Sequence of Waves" group show at Saint Cecilia's Convent in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rhizome.org/editorial/2011/feb/01/sequence-waves/|title=Sequence of Waves|website=Rhizome.org|accessdate=April 16, 2019}}</ref> The HVAC Music Box is a piece that uses the idea of an HVAC unit as a resonator to circulate the sound of music boxes that are activated by viewers. The composition in the music box is an original piece that is on a continuous loop that is only advanced by turning the knobs. This is a manual kinetic sculpture. The sculpture was made for a site-specific group show called Sequence of Waves that was installed at the St. Cecilia Convent in Greenpoint, NY for one day only.

Also in 2011, Lange was commissioned by Flux Projects to create a week-long site-specific installation that involved sound in a public space. The piece he created was called "Sounding Up There".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fluxprojects.art/productions/009-roberto-carlos-lange/|title=009 : Sounding Up There|website=Fluxprojects.art|accessdate=April 16, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.artsatl.org/a-visit-to-roberto-carlos-langes-serene-audio-sculpture-sounding-up-there-the-latest-from-flux-projects/|title=Review: Roberto Carlos Lange's serene audio sculpture "Sounding Up There," the latest from Flux Projects|date=June 6, 2011|website=Artsatl.org|accessdate=April 16, 2019}}</ref>
