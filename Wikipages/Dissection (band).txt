'''Dissection''' was a Swedish [[extreme metal]] band from [[Strömstad]], formed in 1989 by guitarist, vocalist and main songwriter [[Jon Nödtveidt]] and bass guitarist Peter Palmdahl. Despite a number of lineup changes, Dissection released ''[[The Somberlain]]'' in 1993 and ''[[Storm of the Light's Bane]]'' in 1995, before splitting up in 1997 due to Nödtveidt's imprisonment for complicity in the murder of [[Keillers Park murder|Josef Meddour]].

After his release, Nödtveidt reformed the band in 2004 with new members who he felt could "stand behind and live up to the demands of Dissection's Satanic concept."{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} They released their third and final full-length album ''[[Reinkaos]]'' in April 2006, before disbanding that June. Nödtveidt said he had "reached the limitations of music as a tool for expressing what I want to express, for myself and the handful of others that I care about."<ref>{{Cite web|date=23 May 2006|title=Dissection - Final Interview with Jon Nödtveidt Available|url=http://bravewords.com/news/dissection-final-interview-with-jon-nodtveidt-available|access-date=29 July 2020|website=Brave Words}}</ref> Two months later, Nödtveidt committed suicide with a gun inside a circle of lit candles in his apartment in [[Hässelby]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Dissection released a number of live albums and EPs before its final dissolution, and played a central role in the development of Sweden's black metal and death metal scenes, particularly through the influence of the first two albums; it has sometimes been described as part of the [[Gothenburg metal|Gothenburg scene]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jRRvfWp95FIC&q=dissection|title=Swedish Death Metal|last=Ekeroth|first=Daniel|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Bazillion Points Books|isbn=9780979616310|language=en}}</ref>

== History ==

=== First era ===
In 1988, a [[thrash metal]] band by the name of Siren’s Yell was formed in the Swedish town of [[Strömstad]]. Its members were Jon Nödtveidt, [[Ole Öhman]], Peter Palmdahl, and Mattias "Mäbe" Johansson. The group recorded a single demo before breaking up in 1989.<ref name=biography>Andrea Biagi: [https://archive.today/20031005065926/http://www.dissection.nu/biography.htm ''Biography Part One''. ''"The First Era"''].</ref> Nödtveidt joined the band Rabbit’s Carrot, where Öhman played drums. Nödtveidt and Öhman "were never very comfortable in Rabbit's Carrot, which also explains their short time in that band, as they wanted the music and lyrics to evolve on the extreme dark side. Jon would write songs and arrange them together with Ole in the rehearsal place, but the other members, didn't feel that the material would fit the band."<ref name=biography/> In autumn 1989, Jon Nödtveidt formed Dissection together with Palmdahl on bass. In the spring of 1990, they recruited drummer Öhman. In April 1990, the first official rehearsal tape ''Severed into Shreds'' was recorded and sent to underground [[fanzine]]s worldwide "to mark the birth of Dissection, a band that was about to make heavy impact on the scene".<ref name=biography/> The band recruited former Siren’s Yell bassist Mattias "Mäbe" Johansson, who was now playing with the local death/thrash metal band Nosferatu, as a live session member playing the rhythm guitar. Dissection’s first concert was held in October 1990 with death metal act [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]].<ref name=biography/>

In December 1990, the band recorded and released the demo ''The Grief Prophecy''.<ref name=biography/> It contained three songs and featured illustrations by the artist known as [[Kristian Wåhlin|Necrolord]], who later created most Dissection album artworks.

In January 1991, second guitarist [[John Zwetsloot]] joined the band, which now had a complete line-up "and could further develop their characteristic dual-harmony guitar-sound that was to become an important part of the band's sound". The first concert with Zwetsloot was held in February 1991 at a local death metal event in the band’s hometown Strömstad. As the demo was spreading in the underground scene, the [[France|French]] [[record label]] Corpsegrinder Records offered Dissection a deal to record an EP.<ref name=biography/>

In April 1991, [[Per "Dead" Ohlin|Dead]], of the notorious [[Norway|Norwegian]] black metal group [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]]’s vocalist, committed suicide. A few days later, Dissection played the Mayhem song ''Freezing Moon'' in honor of Dead at a show in Falkenberg, Sweden, and made an unofficial special edition of ''The Grief Prophecy'' demo with a cover drawn by Dead. In September 1991 the band record three new tracks for the 7" EP ''Into Infinite Obscurity'', released in December 1991 by Corpsegrinder Records in a limited edition of 1000 copies. In December 1991 Nödtveidt and Öhman also played live in Askim, Norway, at a black metal concert arranged by the Norwegian Black Circle Nödtveidt had joined, and [[Euronymous]], who led the Circle and the band Mayhem. Nödtveidt, Öhman and Euronymous performed ''Freezing Moon'' live.<ref name=biography/>

In 1992 Dissection recorded a four-track promo tape and signed a one-album deal with [[No Fashion Records]]. In March 1993, the band recorded the full-length album ''[[The Somberlain]]'', recorded and mixed at Hellspawn/Unisound studios with [[Dan Swanö]]. During that time, the band’s members, who were temporarily living in different towns, all moved to [[Gothenburg]] after the summer of 1993, where they shared a steady rehearsal place with [[At the Gates]]. The album was released in December 1993 and dedicated to Euronymous, who had been murdered earlier the same year.<ref name=biography/>

As the band members "would find themselves rehearsing more and more without John [Zwetsloot] even showing up" and "even had to cancel gigs because he didn't show up for the preparing rehearsals", they "felt they had their hands tied behind their backs with John still in the band and that they could do nothing but kick him out". The last concert with Zwetsloot was performed in Oslo, Norway, on 14 April 1994. The day Zwetsloot was fired, Dissection called Johan Norman from Satanized (a short-lived project Nödtveidt was involved with), who showed up one day later and "proved to be a worthy replacement for John, having the motivation that John was lacking". Dissection continued playing live, wrote songs for a second album, and entered the studio twice to record demos of new songs and the contribution ''Anti-Christ'' for the [[Slayer]] tribute compilation album ''Slatanic Slaughter'' on Black Sun Records. In November 1994, Dissection signed a deal with [[Nuclear Blast]] and focussed on the second album. In March 1995, the band returned to the Hellspawn/Unisound studios to record the second full-length album ''[[Storm of the Light's Bane]]'', followed by a three date tour through the UK with [[Cradle of Filth]] and a few concerts in Sweden.<ref name=biography/>

During the summer of 1995 Nödtveidt and Norman joined the newly formed [[Satanism|Satanic]] organization Misanthropic Luciferian Order (MLO). In September 1995 drummer Ole Öhman left Dissection and was replaced by Tobias Kellgren (ex-Satanized). He was introduced to the Swedish fans at a show with [[Morbid Angel]] at Kåren in Gothenburg, 10 October 1995.<ref name=biography/>

In November 1995, ''Storm of the Light’s Bane'' was released by Nuclear Blast, followed by a two-week European tour through Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, Switzerland and Sweden in December 1995, and the World Tour of the Light’s Bane covering Europe and America, ending in 1997.<ref name=biography/>

By the beginning of January 1996, Dissection was playing shows in Sweden before leaving for a UK tour with At the Gates in February, followed by a vast US tour with At the Gates and Morbid Angel in March. Back in Scandinavia, Dissection played at the Rockefeller in Oslo together with [[Darkthrone]] and [[Satyricon (band)|Satyricon]], marking the start of a co-headlining European tour. In April, in connection with the co-headlining European tour, Dissection released the ''[[Where Dead Angels Lie]]'' MCD, which contained the title track’s studio and demo version as well as other demo recordings and two cover songs.<ref name=biography/>

In 1997, Dissection played the Gods of Darkness tour together with Cradle of Filth, [[In Flames]] and [[Dimmu Borgir]].<ref name=biography/> Dissection’s and Dimmu Borgir’s show at the Live Music Hall in Cologne, Germany, on 31 March 1997,<ref>Dimmu Borgir/Dissection: ''Live & Plugged Vol. II'', Nuclear Blast 1997.</ref> was recorded and released by Nuclear Blast on the live split video cassette ''Live & Plugged Vol. II''. Dissection’s World Tour of the Light's Bane ended with an appearance at the [[Wacken Open Air]] festival, which was recorded and released on the ''[[Live Legacy]]'' album, and the Nuclear Blast festivals.<ref name=biography/>

Although "[t]he first era of Dissection was now at its peak" and "the situation, at least on the surface, seemed to be stable and prosperous with the band's success peaking, personal differences prevailed". This resulted in Palmdahl leaving the band and being replaced by Jon Nödtveidt's brother Emil Nödtveidt for the summer festivals. After the summer Norman "suddenly 'disappeared' for several months without notice, with Tobias covering up for him claiming to know nothing (however remaining in close contact with Johan throughout this period). The background of this 'disappearance' being that Johan had turned his back on and betrayed the MLO, fearing their retribution." As Nödtveidt was a member of MLO, Norman had also left Dissection behind, Nödtveidt being the only member left in the band. He recruited a new line-up and booked the Studio Fredman for the supposed recording of the third studio album.<ref name=biography/>

====Nödtveidt's murder conviction====
{{Main article|Keillers Park murder}}
On 18 December 1997, Nödtveidt and fellow MLO member Vlad (Victor Draconi / Nemesis Khoshnood-Sharis) were arrested for the murder of a 37-year-old homosexual man, [[Keillers Park murder|Josef ben Meddour]], on 22 July 1997.<ref name=killing>{{cite web|url=http://www.dissection.nu/killing.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20040216045715/http://www.dissection.nu/killing.htm|url-status=dead|title=Official DISSECTION website|date=16 February 2004|archive-date=16 February 2004|website=Dissection.nu|access-date=27 October 2018}}</ref> Nödtveidt received a 10-year sentence,<ref name=biography/><ref name=killing/> and [[Necropolis Records]] released the compilation album ''[[The Past Is Alive (The Early Mischief)]]''. Vlad/Draconi is currently{{when|date=August 2021}} owner of the Dissection trademark.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.solidinfo.se/varumarkesok.aspx?sokord=dissection&sort=15|title=dissection - solidinfo.se|website=www.solidinfo.se|access-date=8 February 2019}}</ref>

=== Rebirth ===
Upon his release in 2004, Nödtveidt restarted the band with a completely new line-up, including only members able to "stand behind and live up to the demands of Dissection's Satanic concept".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dissection.nu/faustleaves.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20040127040134/http://www.dissection.nu/faustleaves.htm|url-status=dead|title=Official DISSECTION website|date=27 January 2004|archive-date=27 January 2004|website=Dissection.nu|access-date=27 October 2018}}</ref> Dissection recorded a two-track EP entitled ''[[Maha Kali]]'' and toured heavily with the ''Rebirth of Dissection'' tour.

In 2006, Dissection released their third full-length album ''[[Reinkaos]]'' through their own label, in association with [[The End Records]]. The band followed the teachings of the Swedish organisation known as the Misanthropic Luciferian Order (MLO), now known as [[Temple of the Black Light]], and the lyrics in the ''Reinkaos'' album contain [[magical formula]]e from the ''Liber Azerate'', and are based on the organisation's teachings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dissection.nu/disc/reinkaos.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20080208150021/http://www.dissection.nu/disc/reinkaos.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 February 2008 |title=REINKAΩS |website=Dissection.nu|access-date=10 February 2011 }}</ref>

=== Breakup ===
In May 2006, shortly after the release of ''Reinkaos'', the band announced plans to split following a short tour. The tour was scheduled to include two appearances in the United States, but these were eventually canceled after Nödtveidt was denied an [[Visa (document)|entry visa]] to the country, due to his previous incarceration. The band played its final European concert in Stockholm on [[Midsummer]], 24 June 2006. Some former members of Dissection have gone on to form other bands, also influenced by their beliefs based on the MLO.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tartareandesire.com/interviews/shaarimoth.html |title=Shaarimoth interview @ |website=Tartareandesire.com |access-date=10 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606111156/http://www.tartareandesire.com/interviews/shaarimoth.html |archive-date=6 June 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

=== Nödtveidt’s suicide ===
On 13<ref>"I onsdags kväll hittades Nödtveidt död i sin lägenhet i Stockholmsförorten Hässelby." Kajsa Sigvardsson: [http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article430279.ab ''Hittad död-hemma''. ''Morddömde stjärnans vän: Fruktansvärt'']. In: ''[[Aftonbladet]]'', 19. August 2006.</ref> August 2006, frontman Jon Nödtveidt committed suicide. According to the Swedish ''[[Expressen]]'', the police said that Nödtveidt was found with a Satanic Bible in front of him,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/svenske-hardrocksstjarnan-jon-nodtveidt-tog-sitt-liv/|title=Svenske hårdrocksstjärnan Jon Nödtveidt tog sitt liv - Nyheter - Expressen|website=Expressen.se|access-date=27 October 2018|language=sv}}</ref> which ''[[Blabbermouth.net]]'' falsely reported to be a copy of ''[[The Satanic Bible]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=56732|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711051035/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=56732|url-status=dead|title=DISSECTION Frontman Shot Himself In Head As Part O…|date=11 July 2012|archive-date=11 July 2012|website=Archive.is|access-date=27 October 2018}}</ref> It was later confirmed by band member Set Teitan to be a Satanic grimoire,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legacy.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=56947|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120526042845/http://legacy.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=56947|url-status=dead|title=DISSECTION Guitarist: JON NÖDTVEIDT Didn't Have Co…|date=26 May 2012|archive-date=26 May 2012|website=Archive.is|access-date=27 October 2018}}</ref> which is believed to be a copy of the ''Liber Azerate'' written by [[Frater Nemidal]], leader of the MLO. With Nödtveidt's death, any possibility to realize a reunion was lost, as he had remained the only original member since Dissection's foundation; in fact, second founding member Peter Palmdahl had left the band in 1997, when Nödtveidt was arrested.

== Musical style ==
Deathmetal.org notes how the band mixed the extreme style of death metal and black metal with "the 1970s style of melodic rock that [[Iron Maiden]] popularized and developed",<ref>{{Cite web|title=Dissection - Black Metal [Death Metal Underground: Black Metal, Death Metal, Grindcore, Speed/Power Metal, Thrash and Doom Metal reviews, discographies, mp3 samples, tracklists and images]|url=http://www.deathmetal.org/bands/dissection/|access-date=2021-04-25|website=www.deathmetal.org|language=en}}</ref> and according to Daniel Ekeroth the band "developed their own melancholic and atmospheric [[death metal]] style",<ref name=ekeroth336>Daniel Ekeroth: [https://books.google.com/books?id=jRRvfWp95FIC&pg=PA336 ''Swedish Death Metal'']. Second printing. Brooklyn, NY: Bazillion Points 2009, p. 336.</ref> which "combine[d] strong melodies with musical brutality".<ref name=ekeroth267/>

Dissection considered the "characteristic dual-harmony guitar-sound" to be "an important part of the band's sound"<ref name="biography" /> and therefore needed a second guitarist.<ref name="biography" /> Due to the band's turn towards [[melodic death metal]],<ref name="ekeroth343">Daniel Ekeroth: [https://books.google.com/books?id=jRRvfWp95FIC&pg=PA343 ''Swedish Death Metal'']. Second printing. Brooklyn, NY: Bazillion Points 2009, p. 343.</ref> [[Tomas Lindberg|Tomas "Tompa" Lindberg]] sees Dissection as a part of the Gothenburg scene.<ref name="ekeroth223" />

Dissection were one of the first bands to cross black metal with melodic death metal;<ref name="ekeroth267" /> due to this, Metal Injection has described them as being one of the biggest bands in the [[melodic black-death]] genre.<ref name="Blackened Melodic Death Metal: A History Lesson" />

== Involvement in MLO ==
{{Main article|Temple of the Black Light}}
The lead vocalist of Dissection, Jon Nödtveidt, was a member of the [[Temple of the Black Light|Misanthropic Luciferian Order]] founded in 1995.<ref name="mlo_interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/extreme/slayermagazine/interview_mlo2.html |title=interview_mlo |website=Angelfire.com |access-date=10 February 2011}}</ref> Nödtveidt was introduced to the organisation by close friends at a quite early stage.<ref name="rockdedector">[http://www.musicmight.com/artist/sweden/stromstad/dissection Dissection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018201325/http://www.musicmight.com/artist/sweden/stromstad/dissection |date=18 October 2012 }}.</ref><ref name=metalcentre>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalcentre.com/webzine.php?p=interviews&lang=eng&nr=123 |title=Dissection – Interview with Jon Nödtveidt |website=Metalcentre.com |access-date=10 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714075021/http://www.metalcentre.com/webzine.php?p=interviews&lang=eng&nr=123 |archive-date=14 July 2011 }}</ref> Nödtveidt said of the MLO in an interview: "MLO is a [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]]-Gnostic order, which seek the true light of [[Lucifer]] through the study, development and practice of all dark, [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] and Satanic magical systems. Our goal is to create a synthesis between the dark traditions of all [[aeon]]s, this way creating the [[occult]] keys that shall open the gates to the forthcoming endless dark aeon. My status within the order is the one of a full member of the second grade and a [[Priest of Satan]]. To become a candidate one must first of all already be an Anti-cosmic Satanist and actively practicing [[black magic]]ian. He/She must wholeheartedly sympathize and share the [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] and anti-cosmic values of the order, and then be ready to dedicate his/her entire existence to following his/her true will in accordance to the dark gods. Becoming an initiate is a long and hard process and can take several years."<ref name=metalcentre/>

Some members of Dissection were very involved in the Misanthropic Luciferian Order. Former bassist, Haakon Forwald of [[Disiplin]], pulled out of Dissection, saying it was partly in order to concentrate on his esoteric studies.<ref>{{cite web |author=Alternatives Musikmagazin - Whiskey-Soda |url=http://www.whiskey-soda.de/news.php?id=12247 |title=Dissection-Bassist Haakon Forwald ist raus |website=Whiskey-soda.de |access-date=10 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718092602/http://www.whiskey-soda.de/news.php?id=12247 |archive-date=18 July 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

When the police investigated the MLO after the murder of Josef ben Meddour, they interrogated its former members, who described the organisation and narrated the occult ceremonies they had attended. Rituals included meditation, invocations of demons and animal sacrifices – cats, which were bought through classified ads. During the weeks that preceded the murder of Josef ben Meddour, Vlad had been more and more extremist in his speech, and the idea of performing human sacrifices, followed by a mass suicide, was discussed at length. During a meeting at Nödtveidt's place, a list of possible victims was made. It included a former follower who had defected, band members from Dissection, and even Nödtveidt's girlfriend.<ref>Ohlin (2012), p. 13-14.</ref>
