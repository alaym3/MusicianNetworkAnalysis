'''The 5th Dimension''' is an American [[popular music]] [[vocal group]], whose [[repertoire]] includes [[Pop music|pop]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[jazz]], [[light opera]] and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] — a melange referred to as "champagne soul".

Formed as '''the Versatiles''' in late 1965, the group changed its name to "the 5th Dimension" by 1966. Between 1967 and 1973 they charted with 20 Top 40 hits on [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'''s Hot 100]], two of which – "[[Up, Up and Away (song)|Up – Up and Away]]" (no. 7, 1967) and the 1969 number one "[[Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In|Medley: Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In (The Flesh Failures)]]" — won the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]]. Other big hits include "[[Stoned Soul Picnic (song)|Stoned Soul Picnic]]" (no. 3), "[[Wedding Bell Blues]]" (no. 1), "[[One Less Bell to Answer]]" (no. 2), a cover of "[[Never My Love]]" (pop no. 12/[[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Easy Listening]] no. 1), "[[(Last Night) I Didn't Get to Sleep at All]]" (no. 8) and "[[If I Could Reach You]]" (pop no. 10/[[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Easy Listening]] no. 1). Three of their records reached the Top Ten of [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Rhythm & Blues/Soul]] chart. Five of their 19 Top 20 hits on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Easy Listening]] chart reached number one.

The five original members were [[Lamonte McLemore]], [[Marilyn McCoo]], [[Florence LaRue]], [[Ronald Townson]], and [[Billy Davis Jr.]] Their earliest recordings were on the [[Soul City Records (U.S. label)|Soul City]] record label, which was started by recording artist [[Johnny Rivers]]. The group later recorded for [[Bell Records (1950s-70s)|Bell]]/[[Arista Records]], [[ABC Records]], and [[Motown Records]].

Some of the songwriters who worked with the 5th Dimension went on to careers of their own, especially [[Ashford & Simpson]], who wrote the song "[[California Soul]]". The group is also notable for having more success with the songs of [[Laura Nyro]] than Nyro did herself, particularly with "Stoned Soul Picnic", "[[Sweet Blindness]]", "Wedding Bell Blues", "[[Blowing Away|Blowin' Away]]" and "[[Save the Country]]". The group also recorded songs by well-known songwriters including [[Burt Bacharach]] and [[Hal David]] ("One Less Bell to Answer") and [[Jimmy Webb]], who wrote "Up, Up and Away". The group's 1967 [[LP record|LP]] ''[[The Magic Garden]]'' features all but one song composed by Webb.

The 5th Dimension's producer [[Bones Howe]] used [[Bob Alcivar]] as the singers' vocal arranger, as well as instrumental backing by [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|the Wrecking Crew]] for their recording sessions.

==Career==
===Formation===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2021}}
In the early 1960s, [[Lamonte McLemore]] and [[Marilyn McCoo]] got together with three friends from Los Angeles—Harry Elston, Lawrence Summers. and Fritz Baskett—to form a group called 'the Hi-Fis' (which later became 'the Vocals').<ref name="LarkinSM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Soul Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-733-9|page=84/5}}</ref> In 1963, they sang at local clubs while taking lessons from a vocal coach. In 1964, they came to the attention of [[Ray Charles]], who took them on tour with him the following year. He produced a single by the group, "Lonesome Mood", a jazz-type song that gained local attention. However, internal disagreements caused Elston to go his own way, eventually leading to his forming [[the Friends of Distinction]], with latter day Hi-Fis member, Floyd Butler.

McLemore sought to form another group and started looking for members to join him and McCoo. McCoo, who had studied with the respected vocal coach Eddie Beal, had appeared in high school and college musical productions and was known for her ability to do torch songs. McLemore found [[Florence LaRue]], who had received training in singing, dancing, and violin; and who won the talent portion at the Miss Bronze California contest, which McLemore was assigned to photograph. McCoo had won the contest the prior year. About the same time LaRue was approached to join the group, McLemore recruited an old friend from [[St. Louis, Missouri]], [[Ronald Townson]], who had sung choir previously. His grandmother had arranged for voice and acting lessons as he grew up. In his teens, Townson toured with [[Dorothy Dandridge]] and [[Nat King Cole]], joined the Wings Over Jordan Choir, and played a small part in the film ''[[Porgy and Bess]]''. He demonstrated his skill as a classical artist by placing third in the Metropolitan Opera auditions held in St. Louis. After finishing high school, he worked his way through Lincoln University by conducting the school and church choir. After graduating, he organized his own 25-member gospel choir.

Another of McLemore's friends from St. Louis was [[Billy Davis Jr.]], who also had sung choir. Davis later saved enough money to buy a cocktail lounge in St. Louis, which he also used as a base for experimenting with musical groups. When asked to join McLemore's new group, he agreed, while hoping for a solo contract from Motown.

===Major hits===
[[File:5th Dimension 1970.jpg|thumb|The group performing in 1970]]
The members began rehearsing as the Versatiles in late 1965 and auditioned for Marc Gordon, who headed [[Motown]]'s Los Angeles office.<ref name="LarkinSM"/>  [[Berry Gordy]], the head of Motown Records, declined the group, but Gordon still believed in them and wanted to manage them. Gordon brought them to the attention of [[Johnny Rivers]], who had just started his own label, [[Soul City Records (American label)|Soul City Records]]. Soul City signed the group and in November 1966 released their first single as the 5th Dimension, "I'll Be Lovin' You Forever", however, the song failed to chart.
 
In 1965 [[the Mamas & the Papas]]' first single, lead member [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]]' "[[Go Where You Wanna Go]]", failed to become a major hit. At the suggestion of Rivers and their manager Marc Gordon, the 5th Dimension covered the song, virtually note-for-note except that the last verse of the 5th Dimension's version includes upward modulation. This 1967 release gave the 5th Dimension their breakthrough hit as it reached No. 16 on the US Hot 100 chart.<ref name="LarkinSM"/>

The budding songwriter [[Jimmy Webb]] wrote what would be another hit for the group, "Up – Up and Away",<ref name="LarkinSM"/> a 1967 No. 7 hit that would win five [[Grammy Award]]s. The following year, the group scored major hit singles with [[Laura Nyro]]'s songs "[[Stoned Soul Picnic (song)|Stoned Soul Picnic]]" (U.S. No. 3) and "[[Sweet Blindness]]" (U.S. No. 13).<ref name="LarkinSM"/>  The group received a gold record for their album ''Stoned Soul Picnic''.

That album included "California Soul", which peaked at No. 25 in February 1969.<ref name="LarkinSM"/>  Weeks later the group's success broke wide open, with "[[Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In]]" from the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' topping the Hot 100 for six straight weeks in April and May,<ref name="LarkinSM"/> and another Nyro song, "Wedding Bell Blues", doing the same for the first three full weeks in November.  Their cover of [[Neil Sedaka]]'s "[[Workin' On a Groovy Thing (song)|Workin' On a Groovy Thing]]" went to No. 20 in between.  Those four singles kept the group on the Hot 100 for all but four weeks in 1969.  By some reckonings, "Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In" was the biggest hit single for 1969.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musicradio77.com/Top1969.html|title=The Musicradio Top 100 of 1969|publisher=WABC|access-date=2020-06-11}}</ref>

Later top 20 hits included 1970's "One Less Bell to Answer" (U.S. No. 2),<ref name="LarkinSM"/> 1971's "[[Love's Lines, Angles and Rhymes (song)|Love's Lines, Angles and Rhymes]]" (U.S. No. 19) and "[[Never My Love]]" (U.S. No. 12), 1972's "[[(Last Night) I Didn't Get to Sleep at All]]" (U.S. No. 8) and "[[If I Could Reach You]]" (U.S. No. 10).  The group had seven other top 40 hits, the last being 1973's "[[Living Together, Growing Together]]" (U.S. No. 32) from the film ''[[Lost Horizon (1973 film)|Lost Horizon]]''.

===TV appearances===
The 5th Dimension performed "[[Sweet Blindness]]" on [[Frank Sinatra]]'s 1968 TV special ''Francis Albert Sinatra Does His Thing'' and appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' twice in 1969.  The group performed and sang "California Soul", and a medley consisting of "[[What the World Needs Now Is Love]]" and the Beatles' "[[All You Need Is Love]]", on February 23, 1969, and performed and sang "Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In" on May 18, 1969, the day after the medley fell from the Hot 100 summit.  That same year the group appeared on the British show ''[[This Is Tom Jones]]'', singing "Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In" and "Got My Mojo Workin'".

The 5th Dimension were the featured act of a July 28, 1969, CBS broadcast of highlights from the [[Harlem Cultural Festival]], the "Black Woodstock" gathering in [[Marcus Garvey Park|Mount Morris Park]] that drew 300,000 festival attendees over six shows. The New York Times reported the 5th Dimension show drew 60,000 alone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prrac.org/newsletters/aprmayjun2017.pdf|title=Parks and Recreation: Harlem at a crossroads in the summer of '69|work=Poverty & Race|publisher=Poverty and Race Research Action Council|date=June 2017}}</ref>

The group sang "[[Workin' On a Groovy Thing (song)|Workin' On a Groovy Thing]]" and "[[Wedding Bell Blues]]" on [[Woody Allen]]'s ''The Woody Allen Special'' in 1969. They introduced "Puppet Man" and "One Less Bell To Answer" as guests in the ''[[It Takes a Thief (1968 TV series)|It Takes a Thief]]'' episode "To Sing a Song of Murder" in 1970.  The latter song was used as a plot device in which its closing notes were to activate a bomb in an assassination attempt of the head of a fictitious country.

''The 5th Dimension: An Odyssey in the Cosmic Universe of Peter Max'', a television special, aired on CBS on May 21, 1970.

During the last season of ''The Ed Sullivan Show'', Sullivan dedicated the entire February 21, 1971, episode to the fifth anniversary of the 5th Dimension. The group opened the show with "[[Love's Lines, Angles and Rhymes (song)|Love's Lines, Angles and Rhymes]]" and later joined [[Connie Stevens]] for "Puppet Man". They came back for the last 15 minutes of the show and sang their hits "Up – Up and Away", "One Less Bell to Answer", "Stoned Soul Picnic", "Wedding Bell Blues", and finished up with "Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In". This appearance was the group's last on Sullivan.

on August 18, 1971, their television special,''The 5th Dimension Traveling Sunshine Show'', first aired.<ref>{{Cite news|title=It's Time to Take the 5th|volume=LXXXIX|work=Alexandria Daily Town Talk|url=}}</ref> The group also performed in ''Burt Bacharach in Shangri-La,'' a 1973 special attempting to promote ''[[Lost Horizon (1973 film)|Lost Horizon]].''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://filmthreat.com/uncategorized/the-bootleg-files-burt-bacharach-in-shangri-la/|title=THE BOOTLEG FILES: "BURT BACHARACH IN SHANGRI-LA" &#124; Film Threat|author=Terry Whittier|website=Filmthreat.com|date=20 May 2005|access-date=12 June 2021}}</ref>

The 5th Dimension made appearances on ''[[Soul Train]]'', ''[[American Bandstand]]'', ''[[The Flip Wilson Show]]'', ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'', and ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''.

===Regrouping===
In 1975, McCoo and Davis, who had married on 26 July 1969, left the group to do collective and individual projects.<ref name="LarkinSM"/>  The duo had success with "Your Love" and the [[chart topper]] "[[You Don't Have to Be a Star (To Be in My Show)]]",<ref name="Larkin60">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Sixties Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0149-X|page=195}}</ref> which won them their seventh Grammy award.

The remaining trio carried on with new members, and nearly had a hit in 1976 with the LaRue-sung "[[Love Hangover]]".  However, [[Motown]] issued [[Diana Ross]]' original version shortly after the 5th Dimension's, and their version peaked much further down the charts than hers, which soared to the top.  The group signed with Motown not long after, releasing two albums in 1978.  R&B singer [[Lou Courtney]] was in the group briefly in 1978 and 1979, Joyce Wright joined in 1979, and Phyllis Battle joined in 1988.

McCoo served a lengthy 1980s stint as the host of the TV show ''[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]]''.<ref name="Larkin60"/>

===Reunion and departure===
The original quintet reunited in 1990 and 1991 for a tour. Townson left the group to try a solo career, but soon returned, as the group resigned itself to the nostalgia circuit. In 1995, the quintet of LaRue, Townson, McLemore, Battle, and Greg Walker recorded a new album, ''In the House'', for Click Records. In 1998, Willie Williams replaced Townson, who died in 2001 due to kidney failure. Battle departed in 2002, to be replaced by Van Jewell. McLemore left the group in March 2006.

{{As of|2009|April}}, the group was actively touring as "the 5th Dimension featuring Florence LaRue", led by LaRue, with Willie Williams, Leonard Tucker, Patrice Morris, and Floyd Smith.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thefifthdimension.org/biography.pdf|title=Florence LaRue & The 5th Dimension: A Brief Biography|access-date=2009-04-25|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530155156/http://www.thefifthdimension.org/biography.pdf|archive-date=2009-05-30}}</ref>

McCoo and Davis, who have been married for over 50 years, continue to tour as their own act titled "Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis, Jr." In October 2011, McCoo and Davis were featured on the [[Cliff Richard]] album, ''[[Soulicious (Cliff Richard album)|Soulicious]]'', appearing live on stage in the tour of the same name, reprising several of their hits as well as dueting with Richard. In 2013, McCoo and Davis released their own double-CD project: ''Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis, Jr. Live''.

On February 14, 2015, McLemore released an autobiographical memoir, ''From Hobo Flats to The 5th Dimension: A Life Fulfilled in Baseball, Photography and Music''.

On June 21, 2016, the 5th Dimension featuring Florence LaRue performed in [[The Villages, Florida]], just days after the [[Orlando nightclub shooting]]. LaRue took the opportunity to share her thoughts on the tragedy: "We will not be terrorized. We know what's happening in the world, but this is a song about good health, love, peace and happiness. We still believe in those things today," she stated before the group performed "Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.villages-news.com/5th-dimensions-florence-larue-charms-sold-crowd-savannah-center |title=5th Dimension’s Florence LaRue charms sold-out crowds at Savannah Center |website=Villages-News.com|access-date=2016-08-25}}</ref>

In November 2017, the 5th Dimension appeared for 18 performances at the Andy Williams Performing Arts Centre in Branson, Missouri, in the Andy Williams Christmas Extravaganza hosted by Jimmy Osmond.

The 5th Dimension was among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=28 June 2019 |date=25 June 2019}}</ref>

There have been several compilations of the 5th Dimension issued in recent years. In 2004, Arista issued ''Ultimate 5th Dimension'', a single disc containing 20 hit singles plus a previously unreleased McCoo-led take on "Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye". In 2011, Sony/Legacy reissued the two-CD ''The Definitive Collection'' as ''The Essential 5th Dimension'', with a few changes to the repertoire. Legacy issued, in 2014, the group's entry in their "Playlist" series of single disc releases, including the radio edit of "Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In" (which was issued on the 1970 ''Greatest Hits'' vinyl album) and a few mono single versions. Finally, in December 2016, Real Gone Music issued the three-disc set ''The Complete Soul City/Bell Singles 1966–1975''.
