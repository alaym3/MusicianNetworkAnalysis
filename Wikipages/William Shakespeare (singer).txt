'''William Shakespeare''' (19 November 1948{{spaced ndash}}5 October 2010) was the stage name of Australian [[glam rock]] singer, born as '''John Stanley Cave''', also known as '''John Cabe''' or '''Billy Shake'''. He had two Australian hit singles, "[[Can't Stop Myself from Loving You]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;2 on the [[Kent Music Report]] in 1974 and "[[My Little Angel (William Shakespeare song)|My Little Angel]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;1 in 1975. Both hits were written by [[Vanda & Young]], who also turned Shakespeare into a glam rocker. After decades of [[alcohol addiction]] and clinical depression he became destitute; he was assisted by music industry benevolent society, Support Act, from 2001. He died suddenly in October 2010, aged 61.

==Early life==

Shakespeare was born as John Stanley Cave in 1948 and grew up in [[Dulwich Hill, New South Wales]].<ref name="Wilder">{{cite news | url = http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/music/shakespearean-tragedy-bright-star-of-pop-cut-short-by-scandal-and-alcohol-20101007-169w2.html?autostart=1 | title = Shakespearean Tragedy: Bright Star of Pop Cut Short by Scandal and Alcohol | author = Wilder, Gabriel | work = [[The Age]] | publication-date = 8 October 2010 | via = [[National Library of Australia]] | archive-url = https://webarchive.nla.gov.au/awa/20101011080757/http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/music/shakespearean-tragedy-bright-star-of-pop-cut-short-by-scandal-and-alcohol-20101007-169w2.html?autostart=1 | archive-date = 11 October 2010 | access-date = 25 April 2020 }}</ref> He was the only son of Stanley John Cave (ca. 1922–1962), a greengrocer, and Elizabeth May ([[Birth name#Maiden and married names|née]] Thursfield, died 1971).<ref name="Ryerson">{{cite web | url = http://ryersonindex.net/search.php | title = The Ryerson Index | publisher = [[Ryerson Index]] | access-date = 25 April 2020 }} Note: User must add 'Cave' into the Surname search parameter and 'Stanley John', 'Elizabeth May' or 'John Stanley' into the Any Given Name(s) parameter.</ref> The Cave family lived in Dulwich Hill for most of his early life.<ref>ABC Television: ''[[GTK (TV series)|GTK]]'', 1 January 1975 (last episode)</ref>

He was vocalist for [[beat music]] group, the Amazons, with Nick Barlow on guitar, Harry Brus on bass guitar, Chris Carroll on guitar and Dally Carroll<!-- familial relationship, if any, between the latter two is not shown in the source --> on drums.<ref name="McF">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop]]|chapter-url=http://www.whammo.com.au/encyclopedia.asp?articleid=362|chapter=Encyclopedia entry for 'William Shakespeare'|last=McFarlane|first=Ian|author-link=Ian McFarlane|publisher=[[Allen & Unwin]]|year=1999|isbn=1-86448-768-2|access-date=8 February 2009|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040419034226/http://www.whammo.com.au/encyclopedia.asp?articleid=362|archive-date=19 April 2004}} Note: McFarlane incorrectly gives last name as Caves and birth year as 1950. </ref> In 1966, they released a single, "Ain't that Lovin' You Baby". After The Amazons, Shakespeare continued performing in Sydney clubs as Johnny Cabe.

==Career==

In early 1974 Shakespeare was in [[Albert Productions|Albert Studios]] where [[Record producer|producer]]s and songwriters, [[Vanda & Young]] (ex-[[The Easybeats]]), were trying to record "[[Can't Stop Myself from Loving You]]", however, the singer they were working with was unable to reach its high notes.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Dave">{{cite book | url = http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3627037 | title = Countdown: the Wonder Years 1974–1987 | last =Warner|first=Dave|author-link=Dave Warner (musician)|date=June 2006|publisher=ABC Books | location = Sydney |pages=72–73|isbn=0-7333-1401-5|access-date=8 February 2009}}</ref> Shakespeare's [[falsetto]] voice was suitable and Vanda & Young used him to finish recording the track; they also signed him to Albert Productions and groomed him into William Shakespeare as a [[glam rock]]er along the lines of [[Alvin Stardust]] or [[Gary Glitter]].<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Dave"/> According to ABC-TV series, ''Long Way to the Top'' (2001), he was one of three contenders for lead vocalist of AC/DC.<ref name="LWttT Ep4">{{cite web | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150214041147/http://www.abc.net.au/longway/episode_4/ | url = http://www.abc.net.au:80/longway/episode_4/ | title = Episode 4: Berserk Warriors 1973–1981 | work = [[Long Way to the Top]] | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) | archive-date = 14 February 2015 | access-date = 25 April 2020 | url-status = dead }}</ref> However this was refuted by both of that group's founders, Angus and Malcolm Young.

"Can't Stop Myself from Loving You" was released as a single in July 1974 and peaked at No.&nbsp;2 nationally (No.&nbsp;1 in Sydney and Melbourne) on the [[Kent Music Report]] singles chart.<ref name="Kent">{{cite book|title=[[Kent Music Report|Australian Chart Book 1970–1992]]|last=Kent|first=David|author-link=David Kent (historian)|publisher=Australian Chart Book|location=[[St Ives, New South Wales|St Ives]], N.S.W.|year=1993|isbn=0-646-11917-6}} Note: Used for Australian Singles and Albums charting from 1970 until ARIA created their own charts in mid-1988.</ref> Also in that year, during the planning stages for the ABC-TV series, ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'', it was suggested that Shakespeare host the show. However, this was rejected, with [[Ian Meldrum]] becoming a regular contributor instead. A number of guest hosts including [[Graeme Strachan|Shirley Strachan]], [[John Paul Young]] and [[Daryl Braithwaite]] compered the show in its early years on an ''ad hoc'' basis.

In November 1974 Shakespeare released his debut album, ''Can't Stop Myself from Loving You'', produced by Vanda & Young for Albert Productions. All but one track was co-written by Vanda & Young.<ref name="APRA">{{cite web | publisher = [[APRA AMCOS]] | title = APRA search engine results for 'Can't Stop Myself from Loving You' | url = http://apraamcos.com.au/search?searchtype=works&keywords=cant+stop+myself+from+loving+you | access-date = 25 April 2020 }} Note: For additional work user may have to select 'Search again' and then 'Enter a title:' &/or 'Performer:' </ref> One track, "Time", was co-written by Shakespeare with Chris Gilbey, A&R manager at Alberts. The album peaked in the top&nbsp;30 on the Kent Music Report albums chart.<ref name="Kent"/>

His second single, "[[My Little Angel (William Shakespeare song)|My Little Angel]]", followed in December and peaked at No.&nbsp;1 on the Kent Music Report for three weeks in February of the next year and he became a national pop star.<ref name="Kent"/><ref>Noel McGrath.

==Criminal conviction and spell in Chelmsford==

In 1975 John Cave was convicted of [[carnal knowledge]] of a 15-year-old girl from his Melbourne fan club, and he received two years probation.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Cockington">{{cite book | last = Cockington | first = James | date = August 2001 | title = Long Way to the Top | chapter = ''Countdown'' | publisher = ABC Books | location = Sydney | isbn = 0-7333-0750-7 | page = 202 }}</ref><ref name="CountWill">{{cite web | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081224020547/http://www.countdown.com.au/the_music.asp?Page=&ArtistID=1 | url = http://www.countdown.com.au/the_music.asp?Page=&ArtistID=1 | title = Popular ''Countdown'' Acts | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)  | archive-date = 24 December 2008 | access-date = 25 April 2020 | url-status = dead }}</ref> He left [[Albert Productions]] in 1977 and had no further recordings — his pop music career was over due to his criminal conviction<ref name="Cockington"/> and changes in music styles.<ref name="Dave"/><ref name="CountWill"/>

In 1978 Shakespeare, who had an [[alcohol addiction]] and clinical depression, was treated with [[Deep Sleep Therapy]] (in combination with [[electroconvulsive therapy]] and other therapies) by Dr [[Harry Bailey]] at the [[Chelmsford Private Hospital]] for three weeks.<ref name="Wilder"/><ref name="GNT">{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/dimensions/dimensions_health/Transcripts/s881704.htm | title = ''George Negus Tonight'' > Health > Support Act | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) | year = 2005 | access-date = 25 April 2020 }}</ref> From 1979 until the mid 1990s, Shakespeare sometimes performed as Billy Shake in Sydney clubs as a 1970s revival act.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="GNT"/>

A temporary revival of his singing career occurred in 1990 when listeners of [[Triple M Melbourne]] voted "My Little Angel" as the [[Dags (subculture)|daggiest]] song of their generation and a [[cover version]] was provided by the Melody Lords. For his day job, Shakespeare was a car detailer at a [[Holden]] dealership in [[Arncliffe, New South Wales]] for most of his working life.<ref name="McF"/> In late 1992 he appeared as a guest on the "Countdown" segment in series 1 episode 12 of the ABC comedy show ''[[The Late Show (1992 TV series)|The Late Show]]'' and performed "My Little Angel" live.

==Decline and death==

Mental illness and alcoholism took its toll on his personal life and by 2001, Shakespeare was homeless and lived in a ticket booth at an oval next to [[St George Illawarra Dragons|St George's Leagues Club]] in [[Kogarah]], where he was found and assisted by [[Lindy Morrison]] (ex-[[The Go-Betweens]] drummer) of Support Act Limited, a company concerned with assisting artists in hard times.<ref name="Wilder"/><ref name="GNT"/>

In 2009 Shakespeare was living in government housing in the southern Sydney suburb of [[Riverwood, New South Wales|Riverwood]].<ref name="CountWill"/><ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/music/countdown-stars-topple-from-grace/2009/08/24/1251001841077.html Countdown star's topple from grace] – ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', ''24 August 2009''</ref> William Shakespeare (John Cave) died suddenly in Sydney on 5 October 2010.<ref name="Wilder"/> Tributes to his life and music appeared in the Australian media.<ref name="Wilder"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.undercover.fm/news/12375-william-shakespeare-dead-at-61|title=William Shakespeare Dead at 61|last=Cashmere|first=Paul|date=6 October 2010|work=undercover.fm|access-date=7 October 2010}}</ref>
