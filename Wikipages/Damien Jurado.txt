==Music career==
Jurado's solo career began during the mid-1990s, releasing lo-fi folk based recordings on his own cassette-only label, Casa Recordings. Gaining a local cult following in Seattle, he was brought to the attention of Sub Pop Records by [[Sunny Day Real Estate]] singer [[Jeremy Enigk]]. After two 7-inch releases (''Motorbike'' and ''Trampoline'') [[Sub Pop]] issued his first full album, ''[[Waters Ave S.]]'' in 1997. His second album ''[[Rehearsals for Departure]]'', was released in 1999, produced by [[Ken Stringfellow]] ([[The Posies]], [[Big Star (band)|Big Star]], [[R.E.M.]]).

He often makes use of [[found sound]] and field recording techniques, and has experimented with different forms of tape recordings. In 2000 he released ''Postcards and Audio Letters'', a collection of found audio letters and fragments that he had found from sources such as thrift store tape players and answering machines. Also released in 2000 was ''[[Ghost of David]]'', Jurado's bleakest and most personal sounding record to date. ''[[I Break Chairs]]'' (2002) was produced by long-time friend, [[Pedro the Lion]]'s [[David Bazan]]. It was his last album for Sub Pop, and was a much rockier, electric affair.

After signing for the Indiana-based label [[Secretly Canadian]], Jurado reverted to his trademark folk ballad-based style, releasing four more albums: ''[[Where Shall You Take Me?]]'' (2003), ''[[On My Way to Absence]]'', (2005) ''And Now That I'm in Your Shadow'' (2006) and the rockier ''[[Caught in the Trees]]'' (2008).<ref>Thiessen, Brock.[https://archive.today/20120709134114/http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=125&csid2=4&fid1=33226 "Damien Jurado Gets Personal"], ''[[Exclaim!]]'', September 2008.</ref>

In 2009, Jurado teamed with his brother Drake to issue an LP under the moniker ''Hoquiam'', released on February 23, 2010. The album preceded Damien's next solo release, dubbed ''[[Saint Bartlett]]'', which was released May 25, 2010 and was produced by label mate [[Richard Swift (singer-songwriter)|Richard Swift]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saintbartlett.com/ |title=damien jurado &#124; splash |publisher=Saintbartlett.com |access-date=April 2, 2012}}</ref> After touring the album with [[Kay Kay and His Weathered Underground]], Jurado began work on his next album.
