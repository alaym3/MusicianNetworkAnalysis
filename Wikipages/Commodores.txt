'''Commodores''' are an American [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] band, which were at their peak in the late 1970s through the mid 1980s. The members of the group met as mostly [[freshmen]] at Tuskegee Institute (now [[Tuskegee University]]) in 1968, and signed with [[Motown]] in November 1972, having first caught the public eye opening for [[the Jackson 5]] while on [[concert tour|tour]].

The group's most successful period was in the late 1970s and early 1980s when [[Lionel Richie]] was the co-lead singer. The band's biggest [[hit record|hit singles]] are [[Sentimental ballad|ballads]] such as "[[Easy (Commodores song)|Easy]]", "[[Three Times a Lady]]", and "[[Nightshift (song)|Nightshift]]"; and [[funk]]y dance hits which include "[[Brick House (song)|Brick House]]", "Fancy Dancer", "[[Lady (You Bring Me Up)]]", and "[[Too Hot ta Trot]]". 

Commodores were inducted into the [[Alabama Music Hall of Fame]] and [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]].<ref name=Vocal /><ref name=Alabama /> The band has also won one [[Grammy Award]] out of nine nominations. As well the Commodores have sold over 70 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.theurbanmusicscene.com/2019/04/the-commodores-receive-honors-from-two-alabama-cities/|title=Motown and R&B Legends The Commodores Receive Honors From Two Alabama Cities|website=theurbanmusicscene.com|date=April 5, 2019}}</ref><ref name=Grammy />

==History==
Commodores formed from two former student groups, the Mystics and the Jays. Richie described some members of the Mystics as "jazz buffs."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&dat=19800925&id=ukUjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qKQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1845,1760997&hl=en|title=The Montreal Gazette – Google News Archive Search|access-date=October 31, 2017}}</ref>
The new six-man band featured [[Lionel Richie]], [[Thomas McClary (musician)|Thomas McClary]], and William King from the Mystics, and Andre Callahan, Michael Gilbert, and [[Milan Williams]] from the Jays. To choose their name, William King opened a dictionary and randomly picked a word. "We lucked out," he remarked with a laugh when telling this story to ''[[People (American magazine)|People]]'' magazine. "We almost became 'The Commodes.'"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://people.com/archive/the-commodores-of-tuskegee-sail-on-a-golden-sea-of-hits-vol-9-no-7/ |title=The Commodores of Tuskegee Sail on a Golden Sea of Hits |last=Kelley |first=Ken |date=February 20, 1978 |website=People |access-date=April 6, 2019}}</ref>

The bandmembers attended [[Tuskegee University]] in Alabama.<ref name="LarkinSM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Soul Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-733-9|pages=55/7}}</ref> After winning the university's annual freshman talent contest, they played at fraternity parties as well as a weekend gig at the Black Forest Inn, one of a few clubs in Tuskegee that catered to college students. They performed cover tunes and some original songs with their first singer, James Ingram (not the [[James Ingram|famous solo artist]]).<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Ingram, older than the rest of the band, left to serve in [[Vietnam]], and was later replaced by Walter "Clyde" Orange, who wrote or co-wrote many of their hits.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> [[Lionel Richie]] and Orange alternated as lead singers. (Orange was the lead singer on the Top 10 hits "Brick House" and "[[Nightshift (song)|Nightshift]]".)

The early band was managed by Benny Ashburn,<ref name="LarkinSM"/> who brought them to his family's vacation lodge on Martha's Vineyard in 1971 and 1972. There, Ashburn test-marketed the group by having them play in parking lots and summer festivals.

Commodores made a brief appearance in the 1978 film, ''[[Thank God It's Friday (film)|Thank God It's Friday]]''. They performed the song "Too Hot ta Trot" during the dance contest; the songs "Brick House" and "Easy" were also played in the movie.

"[[Machine Gun (Commodores album)|Machine Gun]]," the instrumental title track from the band's debut album,<ref name="LarkinSM"/> became a staple at American sporting events,<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Commodores {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/commodores|website=Encyclopedia.com|access-date=May 29, 2020}}</ref> and is also heard in many films, including ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' and ''[[Looking for Mr. Goodbar (film)|Looking for Mr. Goodbar]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076327/soundtrack|title=Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1977)|access-date=October 31, 2017|publisher=IMDb}}</ref> It reached No. 22 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in 1974. Another instrumental, "[[Cebu]]" (named after an [[Cebu Province|island]] in the [[Philippines]]), later became a staple in the [[Quiet Storm]] radio format. Three albums released in 1975 and 1976 (''[[Caught in the Act (Commodores album)|Caught in the Act]]'', ''[[Movin' On (Commodores album)|Movin' On]]'', and ''[[Hot on the Tracks]]'') are considered{{By whom|date=October 2014}} the peak of their harder funk period. After those recordings the group developed the mellower sound hinted at in their 1976 Top Ten hits, "Sweet Love" and "[[Just to Be Close to You]]."<ref name="LarkinSM"/>  In 1977, the Commodores released "[[Easy (Commodores song)|Easy]]," which became the group's biggest hit yet, reaching No. 4 in the US, followed by "Brick House," also top 5, both from their album ''Commodores'', as was "Zoom."<ref name="LarkinSM"/>  The group reached No. 1 in 1978 with "[[Three Times a Lady]]."<ref name="LarkinSM"/>  In 1979, the Commodores scored another top-five ballad, "Sail On," before reaching the top of the charts once again with another ballad, "[[Still (Commodores song)|Still]]."<ref name="LarkinSM"/>  In 1981 they released two top-ten hits with "Oh No" (No. 4) and their first upbeat single in almost five years, "[[Lady (You Bring Me Up)]]" (No. 8).<ref name="LarkinSM"/>

In 1982, Lionel Richie left to pursue a solo career,<ref name="LarkinSM"/> and Skyler Jett replaced him as co-lead singer.  Also in 1982, their manager Benjamin Ashburn died of a heart attack at the age of 54.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2211&dat=19820911&id=5yEmAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KP4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1698,1005172&hl=en|title=The Afro American – Google News Archive Search|access-date=October 31, 2017}}</ref>
[[File:CommodoresPerforming.jpg|thumb|right|Band performance in Florida during the 1990s]]
Founding member McClary left in 1983 (shortly after Richie) to pursue a solo career,<ref name="LarkinSM"/> and to develop a [[gospel music]] company.  McClary was replaced by guitarist-vocalist [[Sheldon Reynolds (guitarist)|Sheldon Reynolds]].  Then LaPread left in 1986 and moved to [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]].  Reynolds departed for [[Earth, Wind & Fire]] in 1987, which prompted trumpeter William "WAK" King to take over primary guitar duties for live performances.  Keyboardist Milan Williams exited the band in 1989 after allegedly refusing to tour [[South Africa]].{{Cn|date=April 2020}}

The group gradually abandoned its funk roots and moved into the more commercial pop arena.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> In 1984, former [[Heatwave (band)|Heatwave]] singer James Dean "J.D." Nicholas assumed co-lead vocal duties with drummer Walter Orange.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> That line-up was hitless until 1985 when their final [[Motown]] album ''Nightshift'', produced by Dennis Lambert (prior albums were produced by James Anthony Carmichael), delivered the title track "[[Nightshift (song)|Nightshift]]," a loving tribute to [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Jackie Wilson]], both of whom had died the previous year.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> "Nightshift" hit no. 3 in the US and won the Commodores their first [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocals]] in 1985.

In 2010 a new version was recorded, dedicated to [[Michael Jackson]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mjfanclub.net/home/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3859:commodores-re-record-qnightshiftq-as-mj-tribute&catid=85:latest-news&Itemid=82 |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 25, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723211525/http://mjfanclub.net/home/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3859:commodores-re-record-qnightshiftq-as-mj-tribute&catid=85:latest-news&Itemid=82 |archive-date=July 23, 2011}}</ref> The Commodores were on a European tour performing at [[Wembley Arena]], [[London]], on June 25, 2009, when they walked off the stage after they were told that Michael Jackson had died. Initially the band thought it was a hoax. However, back in their dressing rooms they received confirmation and broke down in tears. The next night at [[Birmingham]]'s [[Barclaycard Arena|NIA Arena]], J.D. Nicholas added Jackson's name to the lyrics of the song, and henceforth the Commodores have mentioned Jackson and other deceased R&B singers.  Thus came the inspiration upon the one-year anniversary of Jackson's death to re-record, with new lyrics, the hit song "Nightshift" as a tribute.

In 1990, they formed Commodores Records and re-recorded their 20 greatest hits as ''Commodores Hits Vol. I & II''. They have [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] a live album, ''[[Commodores Live]]'', along with a DVD of the same name, and a Christmas album titled ''Commodores Christmas''. In 2012, the band was working on new material, with some contributions written by current and former members.

Commodores as of 2020 consist of Walter "Clyde" Orange, James Dean "J.D." Nicholas, and William "WAK" King, along with their five-piece band The Mean Machine.  They continue to perform, playing at arenas, theaters, and festivals around the world.
