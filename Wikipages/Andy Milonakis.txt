== Career ==
On January 26, 2003, the day of [[Super Bowl XXXVII]], Milonakis decided not to attend a friend's Super Bowl party and instead recorded a video titled "The Super Bowl Is Gay". He posted the video to the website AngryNakedPat.com, and within two weeks it went [[viral video|viral]]. A writer for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s new late-night show, ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', spotted it and got Milonakis on the program. At the time, Milonakis was working as a tech support staffer at a Manhattan accounting firm.<ref name="wash post 2005">{{cite news |last1=Segal |first1=David |title=Who's the Comedian? |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/10/AR2005081002371.html |access-date=October 26, 2014 |work=The Washington Post |date=August 11, 2005}}</ref><ref name="observer 2003">{{cite web |last1=Gay |first1=Jason |title=Elfin Singer Delights Viewers |url=http://observer.com/2003/03/elfin-singer-delights-viewers/ |website=[[observer.com|The Observer]]|access-date=October 26, 2014|date=March 24, 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Silver |first1=Stephen |title='The Super Bowl is Gay' Turns 10 |url=http://www.technologytell.com/entertainment/12210/the-super-bowl-is-gay-turns-10/ |website=TechnologyTell |publisher=GadgeTell |access-date=February 8, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906142043/http://www.technologytell.com/entertainment/12210/the-super-bowl-is-gay-turns-10/ |archive-date=September 6, 2017 |date=February 6, 2013 |url-status=usurped}}</ref>

Milonakis first started rapping on [[YouTube]]; his first song was called "The Andy Milonakis Rap". He was in [[Three Loco]], a group that also included rap artists [[Simon Rex|Dirt Nasty]] and [[Riff Raff (rapper)|Riff Raff]], but on September 26, 2014, he announced that the group had broken up.<ref name="Three Loco – We Are Farmers (Feat.

From 2014 to 2015, Milonakis hosted and starred in a cooking show called "Fat Prince" on Munchies, a YouTube channel that is part of the [[Vice Media|Vice]] network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://munchies.vice.com/show/fat-prince |title=Fat Prince &#124; MUNCHIES |date=2017-02-07 |access-date=2021-06-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207154722/https://munchies.vice.com/show/fat-prince |archive-date=2017-02-07}}</ref> In each episode, Milonakis and a changing cast of chefs combined cheap ingredients with expensive ingredients to make a unique meal.

In December 2016, Milonakis announced he was joining the Baited podcast, with YouTubers Anything4views, Colossal Is Crazy, and [[Keemstar]]. According to Twitchmetrics on February 26, 2017, he was the fastest-growing streamer in the "IRL" category of the popular streaming website [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] at that time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twitchmetrics.net/channels/growth?game=IRL |title=The Fastest Growing IRL Twitch Streamers, March 2017 |website=Twitchmetrics.net |access-date=March 28, 2017}}</ref>
