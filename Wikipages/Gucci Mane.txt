==Early life==
===Growing up: 1980–1993===
Davis was born on February 12, 1980, in [[Bessemer, Alabama]], to former U.S serviceman and power plant worker Ralph Everett Dudley (born August 23, 1955),<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Autobiography of Gucci Mane|last=Mane|first=Gucci|page=3}}</ref> and social worker and teacher Vicky Jean Davis (born 1955).<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |title=The Autobiography of Gucci Mane |last=Mane |first=Gucci |year=2017 |page=6}}</ref> Davis' family had a strong military background. His paternal grandfather, James Dudley, Sr., served in the military for twelve years, including during [[World War II]], as a chef,<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Autobiography of Gucci Mane |last=Mane |first=Gucci |year=2017 |page=4}}</ref> and his maternal grandfather, Walter Lee Davis, served in the Pacific during World War II and on the USS ''South Dakota''.<ref name=":0" /> Davis' father also served in the military, being stationed in Korea for two years.<ref name=":0" />

Davis' parents met in 1978; Davis' mother had a son from another relationship, Victor Davis. When Davis was born, his father was on the run from the police for dealing crack cocaine and heroin,<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |title=The Autobiography of Gucci Mane |last=Mane |first=Gucci |year=2017 |page=21}}</ref> and had fled to [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Autobiography of Gucci Mane |last=Mane |first=Gucci |year=2017 |page=8}}</ref> Davis' father was not present to sign the birth certificate, and Davis took his mother's last name.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Autobiography of Gucci Mane |last=Mane |first=Gucci |year=2017 |page=9}}</ref>

Growing up, Davis was raised by his paternal grandmother while his mother attended college to get her degree.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Autobiography of Gucci Mane |last=Mane |first=Gucci |year=2017 |page=11}}</ref> Davis' mother was a teacher who taught him to read at a young age, and spent most of her time teaching him scriptures from the Bible.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |title=The Autobiography of Gucci Mane |last=Mane |first=Gucci |year=2017 |page=20}}</ref> Davis' first school was Jonesboro Elementary, where he attended kindergarten and the first several grades of elementary school.<ref name=":1" /> His older half-brother Victor introduced Davis to hip hop when Davis was six years old by bringing Davis to a [[Run-DMC]], [[Beastie Boys]] and [[LL Cool J]] concert.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Autobiography of Gucci Mane |last=Mane |first=Gucci |year=2017 |page=12}}</ref> Before moving to Atlanta with his mother, Davis had a distant relationship with his father, who would visit at irregular intervals;<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Autobiography of Gucci Mane|last=Mane|first=Gucci|page=13}}</ref> the visits stopped when Davis' father had two children with another woman and began to prioritize his children in Atlanta over Davis.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book |title=The Autobiography of Gucci Mane |last=Mane |first=Gucci |year=2017 |page=18}}</ref>

Davis moved with his single mother to [[Atlanta]] when he was nine years old due to family problems in Bessemer. Davis' mother had a boyfriend in Atlanta and planned to move in with him, but she decided otherwise at the last minute. They later moved in with someone Davis' mother met in church.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Autobiography of Gucci Mane |last=Mane |first=Gucci |year=2017 |page=15}}</ref> Davis' family was kicked out of the house and did not have a stable living environment until his father set them up in a [[Knights Inn]].<ref name=":3" /> Davis grew up in an area which was high in crime.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Autobiography of Gucci Mane|last=Mane|first=Gucci|page=19}}</ref>

Davis' mother moved Davis and Victor to [[East Atlanta]] and Davis attended Cedar Grove Elementary School.<ref name=":2" /> He was generally good in school and considered himself athletic although he did not participate in school sports.<ref name=":1" /> Davis dealt drugs, mainly selling cannabis with his older brother. Davis sold cannabis on his own and ended up using his Christmas money to acquire crack cocaine while in the eighth grade, starting his career as a drug dealer.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Autobiography of Gucci Mane |last=Mane |first=Gucci |year=2017 |pages=25, 26}}</ref>

===Time as a drug dealer: 1993–2001===
By the time Davis began taking his side hobby as a drug dealer as a career, he was a freshman at Ronald E. McNair High School, where he got good grades and was considered popular among his peers.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Autobiography of Gucci Mane |last=Mane |first=Gucci |year=2017 |page=31}}</ref> Davis never actually took drugs for the first few years that he was dealing drugs, though his first experience was smoking cannabis with a girl he had a crush on. He entered a [[Casual sexual relationship|friends-with-benefits]] arrangement with the girl with whom he regularly smoked cannabis, leading to a slight psychological addiction.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Autobiography of Gucci Mane |last=Mane |first=Gucci |year=2017 |page=32}}</ref>

Even though Davis had been selling drugs for nearly two years by 1995, he had never encountered a violent situation. When he was fifteen, Davis was riding his push bicycle when a man stopped him and pointed a [[IMI Desert Eagle|Desert Eagle]] at his head. Davis was robbed of all valuable items following the encounter<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Autobiography of Gucci Mane |last=Mane |first=Gucci |year=2017 |page=33}}</ref> and began to carry a .380 caliber handgun.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Autobiography of Gucci Mane |last=Mane |first=Gucci |year=2017 |page=34}}</ref> Davis had numerous other life-threatening situations, including a feud with a local street gang who titled themselves "the East Shoals Boys" in 1997.

In April 2001, Davis was arrested on [[cocaine]] charges and sentenced to 90 days in county [[jail]].<ref name="Murder charge">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1502738/20050523/gucci_mane.jhtml|title=Atlanta Rapper Gucci Mane Faces Murder Charge|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=May 23, 2005|publisher=MTV News|access-date=May 3, 2009|archive-date=March 15, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315174400/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1502738/20050523/gucci_mane.jhtml|url-status=live}}</ref>

On May 10, 2005, Davis was attacked by a group of men at a house in [[Decatur, Georgia]]. Davis and his companions shot at the group, killing one. The corpse of that attacker, Pookie Loc, was found later behind a nearby middle school. Davis turned himself in to police investigators on May 19, 2005, and was subsequently charged with murder. Davis claimed that the shots fired by him and his party were in self-defense.<ref name="Murder charge"/> The [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]] district attorney's office dropped the murder charge in January 2006 due to insufficient evidence. The previous October, in an unrelated matter, Davis had pleaded no contest to a charge of aggravated assault for assaulting a nightclub promoter the previous June; at the time the murder charge was dropped, he was serving a six-month county jail sentence for this.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1519599/20060103/gucci_mane.jhtml|title=Murder Charges Against Gucci Mane Dropped|last=Harris|first=Chris|date=January 3, 2006|publisher=MTV News|access-date=May 3, 2009|archive-date=May 18, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518103246/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1519599/20060103/gucci_mane.jhtml|url-status=live}}</ref> Davis was released from jail in late January 2006.<ref name="allmusic"/>
