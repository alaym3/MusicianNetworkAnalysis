'''Vanessa Lynn Williams'''<ref name="Vanessa"/> (born March 18, 1963) is an American singer, actress, and fashion designer. She initially gained recognition as the first African-American woman to receive the [[Miss America]] title when she was crowned [[Miss America 1984]] in 1983. However, a scandal arose the following year when, a few weeks prior to the end of her reign, Williams learned that ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' magazine would be publishing unauthorized nude photographs of her in an upcoming issue. Amid growing media controversy and scrutiny, [[Vanessa Williams and Miss America|Williams resigned as Miss America in July 1984]] (under pressure from the Miss America Organization) and was replaced by first runner-up [[Miss New Jersey]] [[Suzette Charles]]. Thirty-two years later, Miss America CEO Sam Haskell offered her a public apology (during the [[Miss America 2016]] pageant) for the events of 1984.

Williams rebounded from the scandal with a successful career as a singer and actress. In 1988, she released her debut studio album ''[[The Right Stuff (album)|The Right Stuff]]'', whose [[The Right Stuff (Vanessa Williams song)|title single]] saw moderate success before "[[Dreamin' (Vanessa Williams song)|Dreamin']]{{-"}} peaked at number 8 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles chart in the United States in 1989. With her second and third studio albums, ''[[The Comfort Zone (album)|The Comfort Zone]]'' (1991) and ''[[The Sweetest Days]]'' (1994), she saw continued commercial success and received multiple [[Grammy Award]] nominations; this included her number-one hit (in early 1992) and [[List of signature songs|signature song]], "[[Save the Best for Last]]", which she performed live at the 1993 Grammy Awards ceremonies. Her later studio albums include ''[[Everlasting Love (Vanessa Williams album)|Everlasting Love]]'' (2005) and ''[[The Real Thing (Vanessa Williams album)|The Real Thing]]'' (2009).

As an actress, Williams enjoyed success on both stage and screen, receiving an [[NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture]] for her portrayal of [[Teri Joseph]] in the film ''[[Soul Food (film)|Soul Food]]'' (1997). Her best-known television roles are that of [[Wilhelmina Slater]] on ''[[Ugly Betty]]'' (2006–10), for which she was nominated three times for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series]], and [[Renee Perry]] on ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' (2010–12).

Williams was baptized at Our Lady of Grace Church in the Bronx.

==Name==
Williams is most often publicly recognized simply as "Vanessa Williams". There is, however, occasional confusion with the similarly named actress [[Vanessa E. Williams]]. It has been reported that Vanessa L. first became aware of Vanessa E. in the 1980s when her [[New York University]] registrar told her that another, similarly aged student with the same name and from the same state had applied.<ref name="canoe">Hobson, Louis B.

In the area of acting, the two ran into name conflict when [[Screen Actors Guild]] rules prohibited duplicate stage naming. Vanessa E. had registered the name "Vanessa Williams" first,<ref name="canoe"/> so as a compromise, Williams was occasionally credited as "Vanessa L. Williams" in acting credits. To compound the confusion, both actresses starred in versions of the drama ''[[Soul Food (film)|Soul Food]]'' (Williams in the film version, and Vanessa E. in its [[Soul Food (TV series)|TV series adaptation]]). The Screen Actors Guild eventually took the issue to [[arbitration]] and decided both actresses could use the professional name "Vanessa Williams".<ref name="tvguide"/>

Williams was the first [[African American]] recipient of the [[Miss America]] title when she was crowned [[Miss America 1984]] in September 1983.
