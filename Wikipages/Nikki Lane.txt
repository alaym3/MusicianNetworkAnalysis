On September 27, 2011, Lane released her debut album, ''Walk of Shame'', on [[Iamsound Records]].<ref name=wos>{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/walk-of-shame-mw0002210803 | title=Walk of Shame Review | work=AllMusic | accessdate=December 1, 2014 | author=Deming, Mark}}</ref> She co-wrote 'Gone, Gone, Gone' with producer [[Lewis Pesacov]] of [[Fool's Gold (band)|Fool's Gold]]. Her second album, ''[[All or Nothin' (Nikki Lane album)|All or Nothin]]{{'}}'', was released on [[New West Records]] on May 6, 2014.<ref name=npr>{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2014/04/27/305657596/first-listen-nikki-lane-all-or-nothin | title=First Listen: Nikki Lane, 'All Or Nothin | work=NPR | date=April 27, 2014 | accessdate=December 1, 2014 | author=Thompson, Stephen}}</ref> It was produced by [[Dan Auerbach]] of [[the Black Keys]],<ref name=npr/> whom she met at a flea market. Auerbach allowed Lane to record the album at his studio, Easy Eye Sound Studio, for free.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/rock-stars-like-the-black-keys-dan-auerbach-enter-the-production-booth-1410792992 | title=Rock Stars Enter the Production Booth | work=Wall Street Journal | date=September 18, 2014 | accessdate=December 2, 2014 | author=Danton, Eric R.}}</ref> Lane has said that working with Auerbach in the making of this album was very easy and natural for her.<ref name=billboard/> ''All or Nothin{{'}}'' features a duet between Lane and Auerbach, "Love's on Fire".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.avclub.com/review/nikki-lane-offers-fiery-takes-rebellion-surrender--203933 | title=Nikki Lane offers fiery takes on rebellion, surrender, and romance | work=The AV Club | date=May 6, 2014 | accessdate=December 1, 2014 | author=White, Caitlin}}</ref>

Lane's album  ''Highway Queen'' was released on February 17, 2017. It was recorded near Dallas, TX at The Echo Lab from February to June 2016 with Nikki's boyfriend Jonathan Tyler, as well as the other members of her current touring band. Two music videos were released ahead of the album's release; the title track, Highway Queen, in which Nikki and friends crush cars with a monster truck, and Jackpot, in which Nikki and Jonathan Tyler successfully try their luck in old Sin City, ultimately resulting in a Vegas chapel wedding.

In another video released in August 2017 for the song Send The Sun, Nikki and the band play live on a vintage country television studio set and also perform a two-person dance routine.

Unfortunate circumstances struck Nikki's band around the time of recording Highway Queen, when lead guitarist Alex Munos was sidelined by cancer and started receiving treatment in May 2016. He would later recover and return to the band around the time of Highway Queen's release.

In July 2017 former drummer Ben Eyestone passed away from colon cancer. He had played drums on Nikki Lane's first two albums.

In 2021 Nikki co-wrote and performed "Breaking Up Slowly" on the [[Lana Del Rey]] album ''[[Chemtrails over the Country Club|Chemtrails Over the Country Club]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hudak|first=Joseph|date=2021-03-19|title=Lana Del Rey Sings With Nikki Lane on Devastating 'Breaking Up Slowly'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/lana-del-rey-nikki-lane-breaking-up-slowly-1144695/|access-date=2021-03-23|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
Lane's sound has been compared to that of [[Wanda Jackson]],<ref name=billboard/> as well as the sound of [[Neko Case]]'s early albums.<ref name=wos/> She has also been referred to as the [[List of honorific titles in popular music|First Lady of Outlaw Country]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://larecord.com/interviews/2015/04/25/nikki-lane-all-or-nothin-interview | title=Nikki Lane: All or Nothin | work=L.A. RECORD | accessdate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>

===Walk of Shame===
A review of ''Walk of Shame'' in [[Exclaim!]] stated that Lane has "a petulant, [[Valley of the Dolls]] lyrical style" and praised her vocal delivery.<ref name=exclaim/> Another review of this album was written by Mark Deming, who said that "Lane has confidence to spare and a voice that lives up to her own self-worth" and gave the album 3.5 out of 5 stars. Deming also said that Lane has yet to fully master the art of recording music in a studio.<ref name=wos/>

===All or Nothin'===
According to review aggregator [[Metacritic]], ''All or Nothin{{'}}'' has received generally favorable reviews from critics, with a score of 79 out of 100.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/all-or-nothin/nikki-lane | title=All Or Nothin' | work=Metacritic | accessdate=December 1, 2014}}</ref> Holly Gleason, writing in ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'', awarded it a score of 8.5 out of 10 and said that the album's songs "read like Polaroids from a wild heart gone ragged".
