'''Chromatics''' is an American [[electronic music]] group and band from [[Portland, Oregon]], formed in 2001. The band consisted of [[Ruth Radelet]] (vocals, guitar, synthesizer), Adam Miller (guitar, vocoder), Nat Walker (drums, synthesizer), and [[Johnny Jewel]] (producer, multi-instrumentalist). The band originally featured a trademark sound indebted to [[punk rock|punk]] and [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] that was described as "noisy" and "chaotic".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/1363|title=Dusted Reviews: The Chromatics - Plaster Hounds|website=www.dustedmagazine.com|access-date=2011-01-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304202236/http://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/1363|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> After numerous lineup changes, which left [[guitarist]] Adam Miller as the sole original member, the band began releasing material on the [[Italians Do It Better]] record label in 2007, with their style streamlined into an [[Italo disco]]-influenced sound.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hapsis|first1=Emmanuel|title=Chromatics: Night Drive|url=https://ww2.kqed.org/arts/2007/10/24/chromatics_night_drive/|website=KQED Arts|accessdate=27 May 2017|language=en-us}}</ref>

Their third album ''[[Night Drive (album)|Night Drive]]'' (2007) was met with critical acclaim, as was their fourth album, ''[[Kill for Love]]'', which was released on March 26, 2012. Several of the band's songs have been featured in television series such as ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', ''[[Gossip Girl]]'', ''[[Mr. Robot]]'', ''[[The Mindy Project]]'', ''[[Parenthood (2010 TV series)|Parenthood]]'', ''[[Revenge (TV series)|Revenge]]'', ''[[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]]'', ''[[13 Reasons Why]]'', ''[[The 100 (TV series)|The 100]]'', ''[[Baby (Italian TV series)|Baby]]'' and ''[[Twin Peaks (2017 TV series)|Twin Peaks]]'', as well as being featured in the films ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'' (2011),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/drive_soundtrack_features_kavinsky_chromatics_due_september_6|work=Indiewire|title='Drive' Soundtrack Features Kavinsky, College, Chromatics & Cliff Martinez; Hits September 6th|author=Kevin Jagernauth|date=2011-08-01|accessdate=2013-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203014904/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/drive_soundtrack_features_kavinsky_chromatics_due_september_6|archive-date=2013-12-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''[[Taken 2]]'' (2012),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2012/09/taken-2-soundtrack-features-two-key-songs-from-drive-more-105717/|title='Taken 2' Soundtrack Features Two Key Songs From 'Drive' & More|first=Kevin|last=Jagernauth|date=22 September 2012|website=Indiewire.com}}</ref> and ''[[The Perfection]]'' (2019). In December 2014, the band announced what would have been their fifth studio album, titled ''[[Dear Tommy]].''<ref>{{Cite web|title = Chromatics Announce New Album ''Dear Tommy''|url = http://pitchfork.com/news/57714-chromatics-announce-new-album-dear-tommy/|accessdate = 2015-09-23}}</ref> While Chromatics have released a number of singles from it, ''Dear Tommy'' had yet to be released<ref name="destroy"/> when they instead issued the album ''[[Closer to Grey]]'' in October 2019. The band announced its break-up in August 2021.

==History==
===2001: A solo project on a 4-track===
Chromatics' first 7-inch, "Beach of Infants/Steps", was a solo project of Adam Miller. It was released by Hand Held Heart.  Miller has been Chromatics' sole consistent member. "Beach of Infants/Steps" was recorded in Seattle, Washington, on a Tascam 4-track. By the time the 7-inch was released, Chromatics had scaled up to a four-piece.

===2002–2003: Early lineup===
Miller also played in [[The Vogue]], a group that garnered media attention around Seattle. The Vogue were barely out of high school and created art punk that drew comparisons to [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/2000-03-15/music/meet-the-vogue/ |title=Meet the Vogue |last=Martin |first=Richard A. |work=[[Seattle Weekly]] |date=October 9, 2006 |accessdate=June 6, 2016}}</ref> This band featured Johnny Whitney of [[The Blood Brothers (band)|The Blood Brothers]] on vocals and [[Hannah Blilie]] who went on to play drums in [[The Gossip]]. After The Vogue's keyboardist departed, the remaining members formed [[Soiled Doves]], and released one 7-inch and one album. Although Chromatics began as a solo project for Adam Miller, he quickly added most of The Soiled Doves' lineup.  Adam Miller became the vocalist. Devin Welch played [[guitar]]. Michelle Nolan, a new addition, played [[bass guitar]]  Blilie played [[Drum kit|drums]]. After releasing their debut album ''[[Chrome Rats vs. Basement Rutz]]'' in 2003 on [[Gold Standard Laboratories]], all members except Miller left to form [[Shoplifting (band)|Shoplifting]].

===2003–2005: Stripped down===

Miller and a revamped lineup released the band's second studio album, ''[[Plaster Hounds]]'', in 2004 on Gold Standard Laboratories. This lineup featured Adam Miller performing double duty on guitar and vocals, with Nat Sahlstrom on bass and the Get Hustle's Ron Avila on percussion. The lineup changed once again, as Miller played many of the same songs from the ''[[Plaster Hounds]]'' era with Lena Okazaki replacing Sahlstrom on bass and a drum machine replacing the free jazz-influenced percussive style of Avila. This lineup of Miller and Okazaki released a few CD-Rs, still in the lo-fi art punk style that had been established, but the addition of the drum machine hinted at the major stylistic shift to come.

While Miller's CD-Rs with Okazaki hinted at an electronic direction, Okazaki left the band and Chromatics went through their largest reinvention around 2005, becoming the quartet of Miller, Ruth Radelet, Johnny Jewel, and Nat Walker. This resulted in a gradual but dramatic shift in the band's sound and live performance. Chromatics have often toured the world with labelmates [[Glass Candy]], since Jewel plays in both bands, as well as [[Desire (band)|Desire]], a side project of Jewel and Walker. Walker and Jewel also have an instrumental project called [[Symmetry (band)|Symmetry]].

===2006–2010: ''Night Drive''===
Chromatics' third studio album, ''[[Night Drive (album)|Night Drive]]'', released in 2007 on [[Italians Do It Better]], was the band's most acclaimed release.<ref name="harvell">{{cite web |last=Harvell |first=Jess |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10763-night-drive/ |title=Chromatics: Night Drive |work=Pitchfork |date=October 11, 2007 |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}</ref> On ''Night Drive'', the group ditched their "hairy noise-rock troupe" aesthetic in favor of a "neatly groomed [[dance-pop|pop-dance]] quartet". In their review of the album, ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' noted that "the transformation of Chromatics has been so effortless that it's still easy to be wowed by the results", adding that "listeners who are only familiar with the band's forays into shambling [[punk rock|punk]] will certainly be surprised by ''Night Drive''{{'}}s assured songwriting".<ref name="harvell"/>

Various songs from ''Night Drive'' have been licensed for usage in multiple Hollywood films, television shows, international television and internet advertisements, and runway shows.

Other releases have included the ''Nite'' and ''In Shining Violence'' EPs. In 2007, Chromatics' non-album tracks "In the City" and "Hands in the Dark", as well as a demo of ''Night Drive''{{'}}s "The Killing Spree", were featured on the Italians Do It Better compilation album ''[[After Dark (compilation album)|After Dark]]''.

===2011–2013: ''Kill for Love''===

Chromatics gained recognition for their song "Tick of the Clock" which was used in the film ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'', released in September 2011 by director [[Nicolas Winding Refn]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/drive_soundtrack_features_kavinsky_chromatics_due_september_6|title='Drive' Soundtrack Features Kavinsky,  College, Chromatics & Cliff Martinez; Hits September 6th|first=Kevin|last=Jagernauth|date=1 August 2011|access-date=27 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203014904/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/drive_soundtrack_features_kavinsky_chromatics_due_september_6|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> and its soundtrack,<ref>[http://frontpsych.com/2011/09/26/a-review-of-the-drive-soundtrack/ Gosling Noir – A Review of the Drive Soundtrack] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608083317/http://frontpsych.com/2011/09/26/a-review-of-the-drive-soundtrack/ |date=2012-06-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.browardpalmbeach.com/countygrind/2011/10/johnny_jewel_chromatics_glass_candy_moonfest.php|title=Johnny Jewel's Chromatics Unveil "Kill for Love," Glass Candy Headlines Moonfest|first=Reed|last=Fischer|date=25 October 2011|website=Blogs.browardpalmbeach.com|access-date=17 March 2012|archive-date=2 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502073738/http://blogs.browardpalmbeach.com/countygrind/2011/10/johnny_jewel_chromatics_glass_candy_moonfest.php|url-status=dead}}</ref> and again in the film ''[[Taken 2]]'', released in October 2012 by director [[Olivier Megaton]], and its soundtrack.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Taken-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B009DVCN02 | title=Taken 2 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) | work=amazon.co.uk | accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.songonlyrics.net/soundtracks/taken-2-soundtrack-list.html | title=Taken 2 Movie (2012) Soundtrack List – Tracklist | work=songonlyrics.net | accessdate=7 February 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207163818/http://www.songonlyrics.net/soundtracks/taken-2-soundtrack-list.html | archive-date=7 February 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.soundtrack.net/album/taken-2/ | title=Taken 2 tracklist | work=soundtrack.net | accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref> On December 23, 2011, Jewel and Walker—under the name [[Symmetry (band)|Symmetry]]—released ''Themes for an Imaginary Film'', which was described by Pitchfork as Jewel's "most ambitious project to date: a sprawling, 37-track, two-hour collection of cinematic noir-[[electro (music)|electro]]", featuring contributions from Chromatics and fellow Italians Do It Better acts Glass Candy, Desire and Mirage.<ref>{{cite web |last=Richardson |first=Mark |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/44950-johnny-jewel-glass-candy-chromatics-release-imaginary-film-score/ |title=Johnny Jewel, Glass Candy, Chromatics Release "Imaginary Film" Score |website=Pitchfork.com |date=December 23, 2011 |accessdate=April 10, 2015}}</ref>

On October 23, 2011, Chromatics released the title track from their then-upcoming fourth studio album, ''[[Kill for Love]]''. Reviews described the single as a "really hypnotizing, fascinating song that will definitely get you psyched for the record—Ruth Radalet warmly croons her sweet, cryptic confessional lyrics while her band effortlessly weaves a bubbling, dreamy, [[New Order (band)|New Order]]-esque soundscape."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prettymuchamazing.com/videos/recd-chromatic-kill-for-love|title=REC'D: Chromatics - "Kill For Love"|website=Prettymuchamazing.com}}</ref>

''[[The Fader]]'' mentioned, "Maybe ''Kill for Love'' will inaugurate a sea change where artists come to terms with themselves and start being open about how they sound when they sing. In basement studios everywhere, young vocalists will blink three times and start x-ing out effects in [[Ableton]], look at the mirror for the first time in weeks, deep into their beady, sun-deprived eyes and whisper, "God, there are no shortcuts... ''Kill for Love'' continues the band's penchant for popular-sound defiance that made Chromatics so exciting in the first place."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2011/10/25/video-chromatics-kill-for-love/|title=Video: Chromatics, "Kill For Love"|website=Thefader.com}}</ref>

After waiting patiently, Chromatics have begun to reach fans "five years after the release of their incredibly prescient ''Night Drive'' album."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.kcrw.com/musicnews/2012/02/chromatics-artist-you-should-know/|title=Chromatics: Artist You Should Know - KCRW Music Blog|website=Blogs.kcrw.com}}</ref> "Kill for Love" was featured in the television shows ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'' and ''[[Gossip Girl]]''. On February 11, 2012, the band leaked a second track from ''Kill for Love'', "Into the Black", a cover of the Neil Young song "[[My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)]]", which was featured in the television shows ''[[Mr. Robot]]'', ''[[Revenge (TV series)|Revenge]]'', ''[[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]]'', ''[[13 Reasons Why]]'', and ''[[The 100 (TV series)|The 100]]''. Chromatics followed their second leak with three additional tracks, "Lady", "Candy" and on March 11, 2012 their fifth leak "Back from the Grave".

As fans anticipated the album, Jewel mentioned that the process of creating ''Kill for Love'' resulted in a total of 36 tracks that have been narrowed down to 17 for the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.self-titledmag.com/2012/03/03/johnny-jewel-reveals-details-of-after-dark-ii-and-new-albums-from-chromatics-and-glass-candy-kill-for-love-body-work/|title=Johnny Jewel Reveals Details of 'After Dark II' and New Albums From Chromatics and Glass Candy - self-titled|date=3 March 2012|website=Self-titledmag.com|access-date=17 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416051900/http://www.self-titledmag.com/2012/03/03/johnny-jewel-reveals-details-of-after-dark-ii-and-new-albums-from-chromatics-and-glass-candy-kill-for-love-body-work/|archive-date=16 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Chromatics' fourth studio album, ''Kill for Love'', was released on March 26, 2012.

Chromatics were invited by [[Karl Lagerfeld]] to play the [[Chanel]] Spring Summer 2013 fashion show in Paris in early October.
