'''Youth suicide''' is when a young person, generally categorized as someone below the legal [[age of majority]], deliberately [[suicide|ends their own life]]. Rates of youth [[suicide]] and attempted youth suicide in [[Western societies]] and other countries are high. Youth suicide attempts are more common among girls, but adolescent males are the ones who usually carry out suicide.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Youth Suicide Risk and Preventive Interventions: A Review of the Past 10 Years|journal=Research Update Review}}</ref> Suicide rates in youths have nearly tripled between the 1960s and 1980s.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Death, Society, and Human Experience|last = Kastenbaum|first = Robert J.|publisher = Pearson|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0-205-00108-8|location = Boston|pages = 198}}</ref> For example, in [[Australia]] suicide is second only to [[motor vehicle accident]]s as its leading cause of death for people aged 15–25,<ref>Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian</ref> and according to the [[National Institute for Mental Health]], [[Teenage suicide in the United States|suicide]] is the third leading cause of death among teens in the [[United States]].<ref>National Institute [for] Mental Health</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=January 2021}}<ref name=rediff>Iype, George.

==Suicide contagion==
According to research conducted by the Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian in 2007, 39% of all youth suicides are completed by young people who have lost someone of influence or significance to them to suicide. The Commission terms this [[Copycat suicide|suicide contagion]] and makes several recommendations as to the importance of safeguarding young people and communities from suicide contagion.

In 2011 the [[Australian Federal Parliament]] Standing Committee for [[Department of Health and Ageing|Health and Ageing]] Inquiry into Youth Suicide met in a round table forum with young representatives from three organizations at the forefront of preventing youth suicide. These organizations included [[Sunnykids]],<ref>SunnyKids 2010</ref> Inspire, and [[Boys Town (organization)|Boys Town]]. The Standing Committee has since released a discussion paper highlighting the findings of their inquiry<ref>[http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/haa/youthsuicide/index.htm%20 Federal Parliament Health and Ageing Standing Committee Inquiry into Youth Suicide] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108195633/http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/haa/youthsuicide/index.htm%20 |date=January 8, 2011 }}</ref> and will seek to make final recommendations on the most effective means for reducing youth suicide.

===Teens at risk===
One of the problems facing teenagers at risk of suicide is getting psychiatric counseling when it is needed.<ref name=GM>[http://m.theglobeandmail.com/life/health/new-health/conditions/addiction/mental-health/a-four-part-action-plan-in-the-battle-against-teen-suicide/article2182663/ ]''The Globe and Mail,'' 2011-09-28.  Retrieved 2011-10-13.</ref> One research at the beginning of 2020 shows that Compared with older adolescents, younger adolescents particularly agree that increased cyberbullying and  despair are very important factors influencing suicide among adolescents.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Contemporary Characteristics and Lethality Correlates of Serious Suicide Attempts in Children and Adolescents|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2006.01615.x|access-date=2020-10-27|website=login.proxy.library.nyu.edu|doi=10.1111/sltb.12615}}</ref> One study says, "In teenagers, depression is considered a major – if not the leading – cause of teen suicide."<ref name=teen>[http://www.teensuicidestatistics.com/causes-issues.html ]"Teen Suicide Causes and Issues," Retrieved 2012-04-26.</ref> Factors and risks contributed to youth suicide are academic pressure, alcohol consumption, the loss of a valued relationship, frequent change of residency, and poor family patterns.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Death, Society, and Human Experience|last = Kastenbaum|first = Robert J.|publisher = Pearson|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0-205-00108-8|location = Boston|pages = 199–200}}</ref> Harassment is a leading cause of teen suicide, along with abuse. Gay teens or those unsure of their sexual identity are more likely to die by suicide, particularly if they have suffered bullying or harassment, as discussed next. The following campaigns have been started in hopes of giving teens hope and abolishing the feeling of isolation.

Lack of impulse control has been found to differentiate adolescent suicide attempters from a control group of adolescents with an acute illness (Slap, Vorters, Chaudhuri, & Centor, 1988). However, impulsivity does not characterize all suicide attempters, since group comparisons have found no differences between suicidal patients and psychiatric controls on a measure of cognitive impulsivity (Patsiokas, Clum, & Luscomb, 1979). Instead, impulsivity may be important in identifying high-risk subgroups.

=== Sexual minority youth and suicide ===
Youth that fall under the category of [[Sexual minority|sexual minorities]] are at an elevated risk of depression and succumbing to self-harm. Among the population of sexual minority youth, on average, 28% explain having past experiences with suicidal actions and/or thoughts.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Marshal|first1=Michael P.|last2=Dietz|first2=Laura J.|last3=Friedman|first3=Mark S.|last4=Stall|first4=Ron|last5=Smith|first5=Helen A.|last6=McGinley|first6=James|last7=Thoma|first7=Brian C.|last8=Murray|first8=Pamela J.|last9=D'Augelli|first9=Anthony R. |date=August 2011|title=Suicidality and Depression Disparities Between Sexual Minority and Heterosexual Youth: A Meta-Analytic Review |journal=Journal of Adolescent Health |language=en |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=115–123 |doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2011.02.005 |pmid=21783042 |pmc=3649127}}</ref> [[Lesbian]] and [[gay]] youth are the group most likely to face negative experiences, leading to a higher likelihood of the development of suicidal thoughts according to mental care professionals.<ref name=":1" /> [[Bisexuality]] also carries a higher likelihood of suicidality with bisexuals being five times more likely to report suicidal thoughts and actions.<ref name=":1" /> Sexual minority youth also report a higher incidence of substance abuse when compared to heterosexuals.<ref name=":1" /> Overall, studies suggest that sexual minority youth carry a higher incidence of suicide and depression, and that reforms centered on alleviating minority stigma attenuate this disparity.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kennedy |first1=Andrew |last2=Genç |first2=Murat |last3=Owen |first3=P.

=== Previous exposure, attempts, and age impacting youth suicide ===
Exposure to suicide, previous attempts of suicide, and age are some of the most influential factors of young individuals and their probability of dying by suicide. Adolescent exposure to suicide through classmates has caused researchers to hypothesize suicide as a contagion. They note how a child's exposure to suicide predicts [[suicide ideation]] and attempts.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Swanson |first=Sonja |last2=Colman|first2=Ian|title=Association between exposure to suicide and suicidality outcomes in youth|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=185.10|page=870}}</ref> Previous exposure to suicide through parental attempts have also been found to have a 3.5 increase in a youth's probability of having suicidal thoughts, with a 2.6 increased chance of them attempting suicide.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Niederkrotenthaler|first=Thomas|title=Exposure to Parental Mortality and Markers of Morbidity, and the Risks of Attempted and Completed Suicide in Offspring: an Analysis of Sensitive Life Periods |journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health|volume= 66|issue= 3|pages=233–239|doi=10.1136/jech.2010.109595|pmid=20924054|year=2012}}</ref> Aggression in families and its transference can be one of the main causes of transmission of suicidal tendencies in families.<ref>Hawton, K., Saunders, K. E., & O'Connor, R. C. (2012). Self-harm and suicide in adolescents. The Lancet, 379(9834), 2373–2382.</ref>

Previous attempts of suicide also play a major role in a youth attempting suicide again. On average, it has been recorded that the follow-up period for suicide-attempters was 3.88 years.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Christiansen|first=Erik|last2=Jensen|first2=Borge|title=Risk Of Repetition Of Suicide Attempt, Suicide Or All Deaths After An Episode Of Attempted Suicide: A Register-Based Survival Analysis |journal=Australian & New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry|volume=41.3|issue=3|pages=257–265|doi=10.1080/00048670601172749|pmid=17464707|year=2007}}</ref> Evidence shows those most at risk for suicide are those who previously attempted suicide, with research showing that they can have anywhere from a 40 to over a 100 times higher chance of dying by suicide compared to the general population.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Upadhyaya|first=Ajaya|title=Attempted Suicide in Older Depressed Patients: Effect of Cognitive Functioning|journal=The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry|pages=317–20}}</ref>

Age and experience also factor in suicide. It has been found that older, more experienced populations take more time to plan, choose deadlier methods, and have greater suicidal intent. This results in them eventually committing suicide at a higher rate than their younger counterparts.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=A Novel Brief Therapy for Patients Who Attempt Suicide: A 24-Months Follow-Up Randomized Controlled Study of the Attempted Suicide Short Intervention Program (ASSIP).|journal = PLOS Medicine|volume = 13|issue = 3|pages = e1001968|last=Gysin-Maillart|first=Anja|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001968|pmid = 26930055|pmc = 4773217|year = 2016}}</ref>

===Bereavement among young people===
The primary goals of suicide [[postvention]] include assisting the survivors of suicide with the grief process, along with identifying and referring those survivors who may be at risk for negative outcomes such as depressive and [[anxiety disorder]]s, and suicidal behavior. With 42% of youth suicides being suicide bereavement (or contagion) related – further research and investment must be made into supporting this group of people. A few suggestions to make sure the support is effective include making the individuals feel connected and understood.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

== Epidemiology ==
Two possible determinants to suicide attempts are lifetime [[sexual abuse]] and adult [[Violence|physical violence]].<ref name=":0">{{cite journal|last1=Fraser|first1=Sarah|last2=Geofroy|first2=Dominique|last3=Chachamovich|first3=Eduardo|date=3 April 2015|title=Changing Rates of Suicide Ideation and Attempts Among Inuit Youth: A Gender-Based Analysis of Risk and Protective Factors|journal=Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior|volume=45|issue=2|pages=141–156|doi=10.1111/sltb.12122|pmid=25255825}}</ref> Among participants aged 18–25, the [[odds ratio]]s for lifetime sexual abuse and adult physical violence are 4.27 and 3.85,<ref name=":0" /> respectively. In other words, those who died by suicide are 327% more likely to have experienced lifetime sexual assault. Similarly, a suicide victim is 285% more likely to have suffered physical violence as an adult. Based on a survey done on American high school students, 16% reported considering suicide and 8% reported attempting suicide sometime within the 12 months before taking the survey.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/toolstemplates/entertainmented/tips/suicideyouth.html|title=Suicide Among Youth &#124; Gateway to Health Communication &#124; CDC |website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-10-26}}</ref> Between 1980 and 1994, the suicide rates of young black males doubled. [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] and [[Alaska Natives]] die by suicide at a higher rate than any other ethnic group in the United States.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Teen Suicide|last = Woodward|first = John|publisher = Szumski|year = 2005|isbn = 978-0-7377-2428-8|location = Greenhaven|pages = 10}}</ref> In [[India]], one-third of suicides are young people 15–29. In 2002, 154,000 suicides were recorded in India. In the United States, about 60 percent of suicides are carried out with a gun. Some Aboriginal teens and gay or lesbian teens are at high risk, depending on their community and their own self-esteem. Several campaigns have been started to give them hope and help them to feel less isolated.

==Intervention==
One organization in Australia has found that young people who feel connected, supported, and understood are less likely to die by suicide. Reports on the attitudes of young people identified as at risk of suicide have been released.<ref>[http://www.sunnykids.org.au/pdf/print-media/Children's%20Commission%20Head%20High%20Submission%202009.pdf Head High Fact Sheet 1] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823025411/http://www.sunnykids.org.au/pdf/print-media/Children's%20Commission%20Head%20High%20Submission%202009.pdf |date=August 23, 2011 }}</ref> Such reports support the notion that connectedness, a sense of being supported and respected, is a protective factor for young people at risk of suicide. According to Pueblo Suicide Prevention Center (PSPC) for some reason kids today are experiencing more pressure.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Issues for communities===
Intervention issues for communities to address include suicide contagion, developmental understanding of suicide, development and suicide risk, and the influence of culture. Key matters in postvention responses for young people include: community context, life stage relevance of responses, identification, and referral (Postvention Co-ordination), developing a suite of services, and creating ongoing options.

== Prevention ==
[[File:Lifelinelogo.svg|thumb|right|[[Crisis hotline]]s, such as the [[National Suicide Prevention Lifeline]], enable people to get immediate emergency telephone counselling.]]
One can help prevent adolescent suicide by discouraging isolation, addressing a child's depression which is correlated with suicide, getting rid of any objects that a child could use to attempt suicide, and simply paying attention to what the child does or feels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/tween-and-teen-health/in-depth/teen-suicide/art-20044308?pg=2|title=Teen suicide: What parents need to know – Mayo Clinic|website=www.mayoclinic.org|access-date=2016-10-26}}</ref>

Schools are a great place to provide more education and support for suicide prevention. Since students spend the majority of their time at school, the school can be either a haven from or a source of suicidal triggers, and students' peers can heavily influence their state of mind. The school setting is an ideal environment to educate students on suicide and have support readily available.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}
