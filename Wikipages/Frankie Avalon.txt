== Early life and music ==
Avalon was born in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]],<ref name="Larkin50">{{cite book |title=The Virgin Encyclopedia of Fifties Music |editor=Colin Larkin |editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer) |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |date=2002 |edition=third |isbn=1-85227-937-0 |pages=25–26 |title-link=Encyclopedia of Popular Music}}</ref> the son of Mary and Nicholas Avallone.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southphillyreview.com/news/Golden-boy-Frankie-Avalon-returns-home-155823305.html |title=Golden boy Frankie Avalon returns home &#124; News |publisher=Southphillyreview.com |date=May 31, 2012|access-date=May 29, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604070255/http://www.southphillyreview.com/news/Golden-boy-Frankie-Avalon-returns-home-155823305.html |archive-date=June 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> His mother was originally from [[Sicily]].

In December 1952, Avalon made his American network television debut playing the trumpet in the [[Honeymooners]] "Christmas Party" sketch on ''[[The Jackie Gleason Show]]''. Two singles showcasing Avalon's trumpet playing were issued on [[RCA Victor]]'s "X" sublabel in 1954.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.globaldogproductions.info/x/x-vik.html |title = X Records singles discography |website = Global Dog Productions |access-date = September 17, 2013 }}</ref>  His trumpet playing was also featured on some of his LP songs as well.  As a teenager he played with [[Bobby Rydell]] in Rocco and the Saints.

In 1959, "[[Venus (Frankie Avalon song)|Venus]]" (5 weeks #1) and "[[Why (Frankie Avalon song)|Why]]" went to [[Record chart|number one]] on the [[Hot 100 number-one hits of 1959 (United States)|Billboard Hot 100]]. "Why" was the last #1 of the 1950s.

Avalon had 31 charted U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' singles from 1958 to late 1962, including "[[Just Ask Your Heart]]" (U.S. #7), "[[I'll Wait for You (Frankie Avalon song)|I'll Wait for You]]" (U.S. #15), "[[Bobby Sox to Stockings]]" (U.S. #8), and "[[A Boy Without a Girl]]" (U.S. #10). He was less popular in the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]], but did still manage four chart hits with "Why", "[[Ginger Bread (song)|Ginger Bread]]", "Venus" and "Don't Throw Away All Those Teardrops".<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book |first = David |last = Roberts |year = 2006 |title = British Hit Singles & Albums |edition = 19th |publisher = Guinness World Records Limited |location = London |isbn = 1-904994-10-5 |page = 34 }}</ref> Most of his [[Hit record|hits]] were [[songwriter|written]] and/or produced by [[Bob Marcucci]], head of [[Chancellor Records]].

== Film and TV career ==
[[File:Beach Party Annette Funicello Frankie Avalon Mid-1960s.jpg|thumb|right|Avalon and [[Annette Funicello]] during the "Beach Party" era]]  Avalon's first film was a short appearance in ''[[Jamboree (1957 film)|Jamboree]]'' (1957), playing a trumpet and singing "Teacher's Pet".

In the late 1950s, teen idols were often given roles in films, supporting older male stars in order to attract a younger audience, such as [[Ricky Nelson]] in ''Rio Bravo'' (1959).  [[Alan Ladd]]'s daughter was a Frankie Avalon fan, who recommended that he co-star with her father in the Western ''[[Guns of the Timberland]]'' (1960).<ref name="frankie">{{cite news|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jan/07/entertainment/et-king7|title=The reluctant Angel|date=7 January 2003|first=Susan|last=King}}</ref> Avalon sings two songs, "The Faithful Kind" and "Gee Whiz Whillikins Golly Gee"; both were released as singles.

Ladd announced he would reteam Avalon and his daughter in ''Six Steps to Freedom'' but the film was never made.<ref>{{cite news|author=Hopper, H.|date=March 17, 1960|title=Alan Ladd opts 'steps to freedom'|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|id={{ProQuest|167669299}}}}</ref>

Rushes for ''Timberland'' were seen by [[John Wayne]], who was looking for a young actor to play the (fictitious) role of "Smitty" in his passion project, ''[[The Alamo (1960 film)|The Alamo]]'' (1960). Avalon was cast in his second dramatic part.<ref>{{cite web|title=On the Set of The Alamo|url=http://www.texasarchive.org/library/index.php?title=On_the_Set_of_The_Alamo&gsearch=set%20of%20the%20alamo|publisher=Texas Archive of the Moving Image|access-date=August 4, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190717232317/https://www.texasarchive.org/library/index.php?title=On_the_Set_of_The_Alamo&gsearch=set%20of%20the%20alamo|archive-date=July 17, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> After making the film Wayne told the press "We're not cutting one bit of any scene in which Frankie appears. I believe he is the finest young talent I've seen in a long time."<ref>{{cite news|title=As Actor, Avalon Tops With Wayne: Frankie Signed for Repeats; 'West Side' Demands Unique|last=Scheuer|first=Philip K.|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=6 Apr 1960|page= C9}}</ref> "Mr Wayne said I was natural as far as acting goes," said Avalon.<ref name="don">{{cite news|title=A Fledglings Goal: Frankie Avalon Aims High Frankie Avalon Grabs for Handful of Stars|last=Alpert|first= Don|newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=15 May 1960|page=H11}}</ref> He added, "My ambition when I was ten years old was to have my own band like [[Harry James]]. I never expected anything like this... I'd like to be identified as a singer, dancer and actor. I don't want to be just one thing."<ref name="don"/>

"I like to appeal to teenagers and adults," he said in 1960. "Everybody".<ref>{{cite news |title=Now That Avalon's 20, He's Like a Little Adult |first=John |last=Crosby |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=June 19, 1960 |page=G14}}</ref>

Avalon was now in demand as an actor. He provided the singing voice for the lead character in the English-language version of a Japanese musical [[anime]], ''[[Alakazam the Great]]'' (1960), which was done at the behest of the US distributor, [[American International Pictures]] – the first in what would be a long association with that company.

For [[Irwin Allen]], Avalon had a small role and sang the title song in the science fiction adventure film, ''[[Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea]]'' (1961), a solid hit. He had a support role in a comedy, ''[[Sail a Crooked Ship]]'' (1961).

===AIP association===
Avalon was teamed with [[Ray Milland]] in the science fiction film, ''[[Panic in Year Zero!]]'' (1962), written by [[Lou Rusoff]]. [[Samuel Z. Arkoff]] of [[American International Pictures]] (AIP) said Avalon and Milland were teamed together because "they both have particular types of followers and the combination adds up to an attraction."<ref>{{cite news |title=Who Needs High Salaried Stars? Horrors! Film Makers Find Audiences Prefer Action |author=Alpert, Don |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=15 July 1962 |page=A8}}</ref>

For AIP, Avalon made a war movie with [[Tab Hunter]], ''[[Operation Bikini]]'' (1963), singing a few songs in flashback. At [[MGM]] he played the lead in an adventure film set in Africa, ''[[Drums of Africa]]'' (1963).

Of more significance for Avalon's career was a project originally written by Rusoff, ''[[Beach Party]]'' (1963). This cheerful musical comedy starred [[Annette Funicello]] and was directed by [[William Asher]]; Arkoff said AIP originally wanted [[Fabian Forte]] to co-star with Funicello, but when he proved unavailable they went with Avalon. It was a big hit and led to several sequels.

Avalon received an offer to appear in a swashbuckler set in 10th century Spain about [[Fernán González of Castile]], ''[[The Castilian]]'' (1963), then was in the first ''Beach Party'' sequel, ''[[Muscle Beach Party]]'' (1963). It was popular; even more so was ''[[Bikini Beach]]'' (1964), where Avalon had a dual role. In August 1964 Avalon announced he signed to make ten films in five years for AIP.<ref>{{cite news |title=Crosby, Hope Give Youngsters a Break: Bing Features Two Teeners; Avalon Signs for 10 Films |author=Hopper, Hedda |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=August 20, 1964 |page=26}}</ref>

''[[Pajama Party (film)|Pajama Party]]'' (1964) was unofficially the fourth in the series; it was a science fiction spoof in which Avalon ceded leading man duties to [[Tommy Kirk]], but had a cameo. He was back as leading man in ''[[Beach Blanket Bingo]]'' (1965). Avalon later recalled, "'That's the picture of mine that I think people remember best, and it was just a lot of kids having a lot of fun -- a picture about young romance and about the opposition of adults and old people... It was also fun because we got to learn how to fake skydive out of an airplane."<ref>{{cite news |title=Talking Head: Frankie Avalon |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]], Eastern edition; New York |date=July 16, 1999 |page=W2}}</ref>

Avalon appeared in nearly two dozen TV episodes, including [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The Bing Crosby Show (1964 TV series)|The Bing Crosby Show]]'' and ''[[The Patty Duke Show]]'', appearing often as himself. Later, he became a national television spokesperson for [[Sonic Drive-In]]. In 1965 he appeared in the ''[[Combat!]]'' episode "Brother, Brother" as a childhood friend of Pfc. Kirby, played by Jack Hogan.

Avalon and [[Tuesday Weld]] supported [[Bob Hope]] in a comedy, ''[[I'll Take Sweden]]'' (1965) for [[Edward Small]]. For AIP he teamed with [[Dwayne Hickman]] in a rip off of ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959), ''[[Ski Party]]'' (1965). That studio gave him the lead in a service comedy, ''[[Sergeant Deadhead]]'' (1965), playing another dual role. All this activity meant he was reluctant to appear in another "beach party" movie, so he let Hickman play the lead in ''[[How to Stuff a Wild Bikini]]'' (1965), although Avalon had a cameo.

The box office performance of these last few films were disappointing – especially ''Sergeant Deadhead'', for which sequels had been planned.<ref>{{cite news |title=Film Company Seeks a New Locale for Its Teen-Age Movies |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 6, 1965 |page=18}}</ref> More popular was ''[[Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine]]'' (1965), a comedy with [[Vincent Price]] and Hickman, for AIP. This was liked enough to justify a sequel, although Avalon did not appear, Fabian Forte taking over.

In January 1966, Avalon said he no longer wanted to make beach films. "Even a seagull leaves the beach from time to time and I'm getting a little sick of sand," he said.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hollywood Calendar: Her Art Belongs To Daddy |author=Scott, John L. |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 16, 1966 |page=m11}}</ref>

AIP tried to find a new formula for Avalon, and cast him as a stock car driver in ''[[Fireball 500]]'' (1966), alongside Fabian and Funicello, for director William Asher. It was a medium success, and led to other AIP stock car movies, though none with Avalon.

For [[Harry Alan Towers]] he played the lead in ''[[The Million Eyes of Sumuru]]'' (1967), and had a good part in ''[[Skidoo (film)|Skidoo]]'' (1968), a comedy from [[Otto Preminger]]. In England he was in ''[[The Haunted House of Horror]]'' (1968) for AIP.

==1970s and 1980s==
In 1976, Avalon updated his song "Venus" with a new disco treatment.

Materializing as a character called Teen Angel, his performance of "[[Beauty School Dropout]]" in the hit 1978 film of the musical ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' introduced Avalon to a new generation of viewers.<ref name=NYT />

The 1980 film ''[[The Idolmaker]]'', written by Ed Di Lorenzo and directed by [[Taylor Hackford]], was a thinly-disguised biography of Avalon ("Tommy Dee" in the film) as well as 1950s teenage star [[Fabian Forte]] (called "Caesare" in the film), along with songwriter/producer Bob Marcucci (called "Vinnie Vacarri"). In the film, Dee clashes with the record producer and younger singer Caesare, who he feels threatens his career. Eventually, Dee and Caesare quit the label, but their record careers collapse just as the [[British Invasion]] begins. The real Fabian threatened a lawsuit, despite the filmmakers' insistence that the film presented only fictional characters (though Marcucci was a paid consultant). Avalon denied most of the film's events.

In 1980 Avalon appeared in the film ''[[Blood Song]]'' as Paul Foley, a serial killer. The movie was shot in October - November 1980 in North Bend / Coos Bay, Oregon. It was released in October 1982.{{Citation needed |date=June 2020}}

He also appeared in the "[[Happy Days]]" episode "Poobah Doo Dah" playing himself where he sings his hits "Venus" and "Why".

Avalon had the idea of returning to beach party films with Funicello. He hired several screenwriters and shopped the screenplay around town, eventually managing to set up the project at Paramount [[Pictures]]. ''[[Back to the Beach]]'' (1987) was a moderate success.<ref name="times">{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-05/entertainment/ca-2209_1_paramount |title=Write The Wild Surf |author=Klady, Leonard |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=July 5, 1987 |page=K21 |access-date=December 18, 2014}}</ref>

In 1989, Avalon and Funicello appeared as themselves in cameo roles, out jogging the streets in ''[[Troop Beverly Hills]]''. Not long afterward Funicello retired, having been diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]].

==Later career==
Avalon then turned to marketing and created Frankie Avalon Products, a line of health and cosmetic aids.<ref name="Larkin50"/> He promoted his products on the [[Home Shopping Network]] with host [[Bob Circosta]].

Avalon made a cameo appearance as himself with [[Robert De Niro]] in the 1995 film, ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]''.<ref name=NYT />

In recent years, Avalon has starred in stage productions of ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'' in the role of Teen Angel and in ''[[Tony n' Tina's Wedding]]'' as a caricature of himself. Additionally, in 2007, he performed "Beauty School Dropout" with the four remaining female contenders (Kathleen Monteleone, Allie Schulz, Ashley Spencer, and winner Laura Osnes) for the role of Sandy on the [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] television reality show ''[[Grease: You're the One that I Want!]]''

On April 8, 2009, Avalon performed on ''[[American Idol]]''.

As part of a long-running concert tour, Avalon has toured with fellow Philadelphian early 60s teen idols [[Fabian Forte|Fabian]] and [[Bobby Rydell]] under the banner "Dick Fox's Golden Boys".

A cookbook with over 80 recipes from St. Martin's Press, ''Frankie Avalon's Italian Family Cookbook'', was published in 2015.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

On October 18, 2021, Avalon performed on ''[[Dancing with the Stars (American TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]''.

== Personal life ==
Avalon married Kathryn "Kay" Diebel on January 19, 1963.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chic Vintage Bride – Kay Deibel |url=http://chicvintagebrides.com/index.php/chic-vintage-bride/1960s-wedding-kay-deibel/ |publisher=Chic Vintage Bride |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811171905/http://chicvintagebrides.com/index.php/chic-vintage-bride/1960s-wedding-kay-deibel/ |archive-date=August 11, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> She was a [[beauty pageant]] winner he met while playing cards at a friend's house. He told that friend she was the girl he would marry. His agent warned him that marriage would spoil his [[teen idol]] mystique, to no avail.

The Avalons have eight children – Frankie Jr., Tony, Dina, Laura, Joseph, Nicolas, Kathryn and Carla – and ten grandchildren. Frankie Jr. is a former actor who appeared in the original ''[[The Karate Kid]]'' and is now a musician. Tony, the second-eldest son, plays guitar and taught at the Rock Nation School. Both sons play on tour with their father.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

[[File:Frankie Avalon 1960.JPG|thumb|right|Avalon performing in 1960]]
Avalon was mentioned in the [[System of a Down]] song "[[Mezmerize (System of a Down album)|Old School Hollywood]]". The song supposedly is about [[Daron Malakian|Daron Malakian's]] experience in a celebrity baseball game, where he and Avalon were both ignored.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/new-school-hollywood-6398766|title=New School Hollywood|first=Rob|last=Trucks|date=August 4, 2005|newspaper=[[Phoenix New Times]]|accessdate=October 22, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.revolvermag.com/music/6-things-you-didnt-know-about-system-downs-mezmerize-and-hypnotize|title=6 Things You Didn't Know About System of a Down's 'Mezmerize' and 'Hypnotize'|date=May 17, 2018|website=Revolver.com|accessdate=October 22, 2019}}</ref>

Avalon is also mentioned in "It Takes Two", a song from the hit musical ''[[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]]'', sung by the character Link Larkin, and in a song by the [[Wu-Tang Clan]] called "The City" which refers to his experiences of being a big part of the beach party film genre ("Ride the wave like Frankie Avalon").

One of numerous obscure cultural references present in Midway's video game ''[[Mortal Kombat 3]]'' was a lo-res image of Frankie Avalon's face that would dart up in the lower right-hand corner of the screen when Goro killed his opponent by knocking him into the spike pit on the Bridge level.

His song "Venus" was featured in [[Cranium Command]] (1989–2005), an attraction at [[Epcot]]'s [[Wonders of Life]] Pavilion (now closed) at [[Walt Disney World]]. In the attraction, a 12-year-old boy named Bobby (Scott Curtis), tries to survive the pressures of life and falls in love with a beautiful girl named Annie ([[Natalie Gregory]]) at school.

[[File:Frankie Avalon 1976.JPG|thumb|right|Avalon in 1976]]

Avalon and his song "Venus" are mentioned in [[Wendy Wasserstein]]'s 2005 play ''[[Third (play)|Third]]''. The main character, English professor Laurie Jameson, watches a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] reunion show featuring Avalon singing the song, and sings a line of it to her daughter. In stage productions of the show, part of the song is played and a portion of the supposed [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] special is screened as part of the scenery.

Avalon is also referenced in the 1994 film, ''[[The Stöned Age]]'', in which he makes an ending scene [[cameo appearance]].

His song "Venus" additionally appeared in [[Dexter (season 4)|season 4]] of the TV series ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'' in which [[John Lithgow]]'s character, [[Arthur Mitchell (character)|Arthur Mitchell]], plays it to remember his deceased sister. Also, "Venus" is sampled in [[Nick Bertke]]'s, single, "J'Adore Juin", a mashup of sounds from the movie [[The Apartment]].
"Venus" also appeared in the 2016 film ''[[10 Cloverfield Lane]]'' starring John Goodman.

Avalon is also mentioned in [[The Vaccines]]' song "[[Teenage Icon (song)|Teenage Icon]]".
