'''Marco''' "'''Benny'''" '''Benassi''' ({{IPA-it|ˈmarko ˈbɛnassi}}; born 13 July 1967) is an Italian DJ, record producer and remixer. He is widely seen as a pioneer of [[electro house]], a genre brought into the mainstream by his 2002 summer club hit "[[Satisfaction (Benny Benassi song)|Satisfaction]]".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.noiseprn.com/2016/07/11/benny-benassi-new-album/|title=Benny Benassi Announces New Album|work=Noiseporn|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en-US|quote=The chart-topping track paved the way for Benassi’s career and for what we know today as electro house.}}</ref>

He started his career as DJ along with his cousin [[Alle Benassi|Alessandro "Alle" Benassi]], forming the electronica duo [[Benassi Bros.]] Although he began to gain popularity with his pseudonym in 1997 by releasing the song "Electric Flying", his first international hit was "I Feel So Fine", launched in 2001 under the nickname KMC.

In 2003, Benassi released his first solo debut album, ''[[Hypnotica (Benny Benassi album)|Hypnotica]]'', to positive reviews. It incorporates electroclash sounds and many elements of house music, and won the [[European Border Breakers Award]]. The following year, the debut album of the Benassi Bros., ''[[Pumphonia]]'', was released. Their track "Illusion" became very popular in the American club scene, finally peaking at number 4 on [[Hot Dance Club Play]]. Following "Hit My Heart" peaked at 15.

==Career==

===Early days===
A native of [[Milan]] and raised in [[Reggio Emilia]], DJ and producer Benassi, started DJing alongside cousin Alle Benassi in the late 1980s in their hometown, before moving to [[Larry Pignagnoli]]'s Off Limits production studio in the mid-1990s, creating music for various acts, including [[Whigfield]], J.K. and Ally & Jo.<ref>{{cite web|title=Benny Benassi Bio, Music, News & Shows |url=http://djz.com/featured_djs/benny-benassi/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130410182125/http://djz.com/featured_djs/benny-benassi/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 10, 2013 |publisher=DJZ.com |access-date=March 7, 2013 }}</ref> In 2001, Benassi, under the name KMC, released his first hit called "I Feel So Fine", with vocals by [[Dhany]]. The track first climbed the charts in Benassi's native Italy, and soon became a #1 hit in the UK club charts.<ref name="Benny Benassi - About" />

Moving from house to electro, "[[Satisfaction (Benny Benassi song)|Satisfaction]]" took Benassi's success worldwide a year later with high-profile DJs like [[Carl Cox]], [[Darren Emerson]], and [[Roger Sanchez]] offering praises. The track reached #2 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/satisfaction/|title=satisfaction {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}</ref> after the [[Ministry of Sound]] record company replaced the original video (an almost still picture of the band, overlaid with graphics) with a video of models using power tools.

===2003–04: ''Hypnotica''===
In 2003 Benny Benassi released his first solo debut album ''[[Hypnotica (Benny Benassi album)|Hypnotica]]'' (he won the European Border Breakers Award<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://esns.nl/ebba/ebba-results/|title=EBBA-results - Eurosonic Noorderslag|work=Eurosonic Noorderslag|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en-US}}</ref> in 2005 which racked up the most sales for an Italian album outside Italy).

===2005–07: ''Pumphonia'' and ''…Phobia''===
Benassi often works with vocalists Paul French and Violeta, who are collectively known as The Biz. He produced a group with cousin Alle, called [[Benassi Bros.]], a project designed to shine the spotlight on the two Biz vocalists, Paul French and Violeta Claudia and other guest singers. A year after the release of ''Hypnotica'', the album ''[[Pumphonia]]'' marked their first full-length release, and in 2005, Benassi Bros. released their second album ''[[…Phobia]]''.

Some of Benassi's [[Single (music)|singles]] have charted high in the [[United Kingdom]] and have been played worldwide in [[Nightclub|clubs]]. Remixes for [[OutKast]], [[Goldfrapp]], and [[Felix da Housecat]] followed. Benassi also remixes music of his contemporaries, such as [[Tomcraft]] and [[Fischerspooner]].

In 2005, Benassi founded the record label Pump-Kin Music. The focus of the label is primarily new and unsigned producers. The stated aim of the venture is to give exposure to some of the lesser known DJ/production talent across the world.

In August 2007, Benassi released a remix of [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy's]] "Bring the Noise". The video for the track was created by [[Eclectic Method]] and features a montage of live footage from Public Enemy. It premiered on imeem.com. In February 2008, "Bring the Noise" won a Grammy for best Remix (Dance).

===2008–09: ''Rock 'n' Rave''===
His album ''[[Rock 'n' Rave]]'' was released on 16 June 2008. The first single from the album was "I Am Not Drunk."
