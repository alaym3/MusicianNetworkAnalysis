The group consists of 23 members as of April 2021, ranging in age from late teens to mid-twenties and divided into four different sub-units.

The group debuted their first sub-unit, the rotational '''NCT U''', on April 9, 2016 with the double digital single "The 7th Sense" and "Without You". It was followed by the [[Seoul]]-based sub-unit [[NCT 127]] on July 7, 2016 with their [[NCT 127 (EP)|eponymous extended play]] and the then-teenaged sub-unit [[NCT Dream]] on August 24, 2016 with the digital single "Chewing Gum". [[WayV]], a seven-member sub-unit based in China and NCT's first overseas sub-unit, debuted on January 17, 2019 with the single album ''[[The Vision (single album)|The Vision]]''. NCT's second overseas sub-unit, '''NCT Hollywood''', will be based in the [[United States]] and is set to debut at a later date.<ref name="Hollywood">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/nct-hollywood-survival-show-mgm-sm-1234949279/|title=MGM Television Teams With Korea’s SM Entertainment for U.S. K-Pop Competition Show|website=The Hollywood Reporter|date=May 6, 2021|access-date=May 6, 2021|archive-date=May 6, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210506201853/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/nct-hollywood-survival-show-mgm-sm-1234949279/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="future">{{cite web|last=Yoon|first=Sang-geun|url=https://star.mt.co.kr/stview.php?no=2021011201223338560&type=3|script-title=ko:[단독]NCT "2021년에는 하루빨리 팬들 보고 싶다"[인터뷰③]|trans-title=[Exclusive] NCT "I want to see my fans as soon as possible in 2021" [Interview③]|date=January 12, 2021|access-date=January 28, 2021|work=StarNews|archive-date=January 28, 2021|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210128052933/https://star.mt.co.kr/stview.php?no=2021011201223338560&type=3|url-status=live}}</ref>

Although each sub-unit promotes separately, NCT has united twice as a group to record two full-length albums, ''[[NCT 2018 Empathy|Empathy]]'' (2018) and ''[[NCT 2020 Resonance|Resonance]]'' (2020). Within two months of release, the latter sold over 2.6 million copies across its two parts, becoming the highest-selling physical album ever released by an act from SM Entertainment and earning the group their first Grand Daesang Award at the 2020 [[Asia Artist Awards]].

== Background and name ==
In January 2016, SM Entertainment founder [[Lee Soo-man]] delivered a presentation at the SM Coex Artium titled "SMTOWN: New Culture Technology 2016".<ref>{{Cite video|title=SMTOWN: New Culture Technology, 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ky5NvWsXnn8|language=en|access-date=2020-05-21}}</ref> The label planned to debut a new boy group that would "fall in line" with their [[Cultural technology|culture contents]] strategy, one that would contain an "unlimited" number of members that would debut in separate sub-units within the group. Furthermore, the members would form "sub-unit teams" and have "collaborations" with each other.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=SM Entertainment's next boy band to have 'unlimited' members|url=http://kpopherald.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=201601271758282555044_2|last=Jung|first=Min-kyung|date=January 27, 2016|website=Kpop Herald|access-date=December 4, 2019|archive-date=May 18, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200518065739/http://kpopherald.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=201601271758282555044_2|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=S.

The first members of NCT to be introduced were [[Lee Tae-yong|Taeyong]] and Jeno.<ref>{{Cite web|title=SM루키즈 공개… 슈퍼주니어 규현의 그녀(?)
