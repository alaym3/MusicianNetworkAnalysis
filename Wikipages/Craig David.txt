David was bullied by other students at school. He wrote and released the song "Johnny" in 2005 about his sad memories of being bullied.<ref>The David's Album "The Story Goes..." released in 6 September 2005</ref>

David's father played bass in a reggae band called Ebony Rockers. As a teen, David began accompanying his father to local dance clubs, where DJs let him take the microphone.

==Career==
===Early career===
David's earliest exposure came when he worked on a B-side to British group [[Damage (British band)|Damage]]'s cover of "[[Wonderful Tonight#Damage version|Wonderful Tonight]]", on the track "I'm Ready". He then started doing vocals for the English [[UK garage|garage]] duo [[Artful Dodger (duo)|Artful Dodger]], on tracks such as "Something" and "What Ya Gonna Do".

[[Telstar Records|Wildstar Records]] first became aware of David when the artist's then manager Paul Widger met the label's co-owner [[Colin Lester]] and played some of his music.<ref name="hitquarters">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Colin_Lester_Interview.html |title=Interview With Colin Lester |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=10 December 2001 |access-date=3 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221123/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_Colin_Lester_Interview.html |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Lester later told [[HitQuarters]] that he was particularly impressed by the first song he heard, "[[Walking Away (Craig David song)|Walking Away]]", saying "That was an absolute stand out ... It struck me that any seventeen year-old that could write a song like this had huge potential."<ref name="hitquarters"/> The Wildstar boss was further won over when, on later visiting the artist's home in Southampton, he found David's tiny bedroom stacked from floor to ceiling with 12" vinyl records, commenting: "That convinced me he was the real deal and not just some kid acting out the part."<ref name="hitquarters"/> At that point Lester offered him a development deal with his label. When Lester later heard the song "[[7 Days (Craig David song)|7 Days]]", he said he immediately heard a number-one record and promoted the contract to an album deal the same day.<ref name="hitquarters"/>

===2000–2003: ''Born to Do It'' and ''Slicker Than Your Average''===
The song "[[Re-Rewind (The Crowd Say Bo Selecta)]]", from the Artful Dodger album ''[[It's All About the Stragglers]]'', hit number two on the UK charts in 1999; thus, paving the way for a solo career. David's first single, "[[Fill Me In]]", released on [[Colin Lester]]'s and Ian McAndrew's [[Telstar Records|Wildstar Records]], topped the UK chart and was the first of a string of four top 10 singles from his debut album ''[[Born to Do It]]'', which eventually sold more than 8 million copies worldwide, earning multi-platinum status in more than 20 countries.<ref name=bio>[http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003632/Craig-David.html Craig David Biography<!-- Bot generated title -->] musicianguide.com</ref><ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=craig david|chart=all}} Billboard.com – Artist Chart History – Craig David<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The song "Key to My Heart", taken from the US version of the album, was also featured on the award-winning [[Warner Bros.]] animated film ''[[Osmosis Jones]]''.

The success of David's debut, which was written almost entirely by David and [[Mark Hill (musician)|Mark Hill]] of [[Artful Dodger (UK band)|Artful Dodger]], led to the United States release of "Fill Me In" in May 2001. It reached number 15 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. ''[[Born to Do It]]'' was released in the United States on 17 July 2001, peaking at number 11 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and sold over 1 million copies. The single "7 Days" hit the top 10 in the U.S.; although "Walking Away", which had reached number 3 in the UK and number 5 in [[Australia]], missed the top 40 in the U.S. and was the last of his singles to chart there.

In April 2009, MTV viewers voted ''Born to Do It'' as number 2 on their "Greatest Album of All-Time" poll, behind [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2009/04/09/michael-jackson-s-album-thriller-voted-best-album-since-1981-115875-21265620/|title=Michael Jackson's Thriller voted best album since 1981|website=[[Daily Mirror]]|access-date=3 September 2009}}</ref>

The follow-up album, ''[[Slicker Than Your Average]]'', was released in 2002. The album's first four singles continued David's streak of top 10 hits in the UK, bringing a total of nine consecutive top 10 hits until "World Filled with Love" peaked at number 15 in 2003. None of the six singles released from the album charted in the U.S.. Although "What's Your Flava?" and "[[Rise & Fall (Craig David song)|Rise & Fall]]" (duet with [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]) received airplay on the [[urban contemporary]] and [[Adult contemporary music#Soft adult contemporary|soft adult contemporary]] formats, they did not make the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart or the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart. However, "What's Your Flava?" made the [[Rhythmic (chart)|Rhythmic Top 40]] chart (number 32), [[Mainstream Top 40]] chart (number 24) and the [[Top 40 Tracks]] chart (number 37). According to the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], ''Slicker Than Your Average'' was certified Gold in the U.S..

David also commented that the album title could be looked at in two different ways: "On the one hand, it's coming across like I'm arrogant. On the other hand, it's saying I have a lot more composure on the album.""<ref>{{cite web |first=Adam |last=Gonshor |url=http://www.andpop.com/2002/11/29/interview-craig-david-releases-slicker-than-your-average/ |title=Craig David releases Slicker Than Your Average |publisher=andPop.com |date=29 November 2002 |access-date=9 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518052519/http://www.andpop.com/2002/11/29/interview-craig-david-releases-slicker-than-your-average/ |archive-date=18 May 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The album was leaked onto the internet prior to its official release but David was not too bothered as he feels it "spreads the word".

===2005–2008: ''The Story Goes...'' and ''Trust Me''===
[[File:Craig David by Nawaz Akbar.jpg|thumb|left|Live in London, 2005]]
David later signed on with [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music]] and put together his third album, ''The Story Goes...'', which was released worldwide in August 2005 (excluding the U.S. where it was never released). The first single, "All the Way", returned him to the top 3. The second single, "Don't Love You No More (I'm Sorry)", tied with "7 Days" as his longest-running single in the charts since "Re-Rewind", spending 15 weeks inside the UK top 75. The album's third single, "Unbelievable", debuted at number 18 in March 2006.

In 2007, David collaborated with British rapper [[Kano (rapper)|Kano]] on his album ''[[London Town (Kano album)|London Town]]'', for the single "[[This Is the Girl]]". The track was released on 27 August 2007 and debuted at number 18 on the UK charts.

The first single from his album ''[[Trust Me (album)|Trust Me]]'', "[[Hot Stuff (Let's Dance)]]", was released on 5 November 2007. David successfully sought permission from [[David Bowie]] to sample his 1983 [[List of UK Singles Chart number ones of the 1980s|number-one single]] "[[Let's Dance (David Bowie song)|Let's Dance]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/37188/craig-david-thanks-david-bowie-for-sample |title=Craig David Thanks David Bowie For Sample |work=Gigwise |date=22 September 2007 |access-date=14 February 2016}}</ref> The single was a top ten hit, whilst the album charted at number 18 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. "[[6 of 1 Thing]]", the second single to be taken from ''[[Trust Me (album)|Trust Me]]'', charted at number 39 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming his third-lowest-charting single to date.

"[[Officially Yours]]" was released on 23 June 2008 and peaked at number 158 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming his lowest-charting single to date and was the final single from ''Trust Me''. In July, a new track titled "Are You Up for This" started receiving airplay on various radio stations as part of a promo with Ice Cream Records, which also featured a remix with [[Wittyboy]] called "Nutter Butter". On 17 August 2008, David performed at a birthday tribute concert for songwriter [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]] at the [[London Palladium]]. He performed the song "Ben", originally a hit for [[Michael Jackson]].

David took part in ''[[Soccer Aid]]'' 2008 at [[Wembley Stadium]] on 7 September 2008. He picked up the "Man of The Match" award on the night and played in the same England side as ex-internationals such as [[Alan Shearer]], [[Teddy Sheringham]] and [[David Seaman]], and played against the likes of [[Romário]], [[Paolo Di Canio]], [[Jaap Stam]], and [[Luís Figo]]. David received two 2008 UK [[Urban Music Awards|Urban Music Award]] nominations for Best Album with ''[[Trust Me (album)|Trust Me]]'' and Best R&B Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanmusicawards.net/uk_vote_now.php|title=Urban Music Awards 2008 , Uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210040012/http://www.urbanmusicawards.net/uk_vote_now.php|archive-date=10 December 2008}}</ref> On 7 November 2008, David was recognised for his contribution to the music industry by receiving an honorary degree of Doctor of Music, from [[Southampton Solent University]] at a graduation ceremony held at Southampton Guildhall.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kennedy|first=Clare|title=Craig David receives an honorary degree of Doctor of Music from Southampton University|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/3827309.Singing_star_Craig_earns_another_degree_of_success/|work=[[Southern Daily Echo]]|location=Southampton|date=7 November 2008|access-date=14 July 2012}}</ref>

===2008–2009: ''Greatest Hits''===
[[File:Craig-David 2008.jpg|thumb|Live in Madrid, 2008]]
David released his first ''[[Greatest Hits (Craig David album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album on 24 November 2008. In support of the release, David released two singles to promote the album. "[[Where's Your Love]]" featuring [[Tinchy Stryder]] and [[Rita Ora]], a homage to his [[UK garage]] days, was digitally released on 10 November 2008.
