Along with frame builder [[Steve Potts (bicycle builder)|Steve Potts]] and his helper Mark Slate, Cunningham co-founded [[Wilderness Trail Bikes]] (WTB). Cunningham and Potts were forced out of WTB in 2002 for undisclosed reasons, at the urging of WTB's CEO, Patrick Seidler.{{cn|date=August 2019}} Cunningham  and his wife [[Jacquie Phelan]] are charter inductees to Crested Butte's Mountain Bike Hall of Fame.<ref name="hof"/>

==Early life==
Cunningham came from an Air Force family, who lived in Alabama, Virginia, Japan and San Diego during his childhood, ultimately settling in [[Mill Valley]] on [[Mt Tamalpais]], [[Marin County]]. His father, Bruce Cunningham, was a World War II and [[Korean War]] fighter pilot who won the [[Thompson Trophy]]  in 1949, the only year military jets (F-86) competed. His mother, Carol, was a book artist whose imprint ''Sunflower Press'' is found in several museum collections. In his twenties, Cunningham studied nutrition, water quality, and chemistry, as well as engineering. At 25 he recognized that automobile use in the USA is largely wasteful, polluting, and socially ruinous, and therefore turned to bicycles.

==Inventions==

In the early 1980s, Cunningham invented a number of features for use on modern mountain bikes:

*tubular-style fork crowns
*135&nbsp;mm lower-dish rear wheel for mountain bikes, which are now the standard
*identifying the fundamental [[Bicycle tire#Tread|tread]] design principles needed for well-performing mountain bike [[Bicycle tire|tires]]. Cunningham co-designed Ground Control,<ref>{{US patent reference |number=5088535 |y=1992 |m=02 |d=18 |inventor=Potts, Stephen M.; Slate, Mark J.; Cunningham, Charles B.; and Merz, James H. |title=Bicycle or motorcycle tire tread }}</ref> a tire incorporating these principles.
*the Grease Guard Bearing System<ref>{{US patent reference |number=4763957 |y=1988 |m=08 |d=16 |inventor=Poehlmann, Paul W.; Slate, Mark J.; Potts, Stephen M.; and Cunningham, Charles B. |title=Bicycle hub constructions and lubrication thereof }}</ref> that allows bicyclists to replace the dirty grease that gets into bicycle bearings with clean grease in seconds, thus extending component life and saving time and money spent fixing and/or replacing parts.
*the [[Bicycle brakes#Roller cam brakes|Roller Cam Brake]].<ref>{{US patent reference |number=4765443 |y=1988 |m=08 |d=23 |inventor=Cunningham, Charles B. |title=Caliper brake for mountain bicycles having wide tires }}</ref> The brake arms, the pivot mounting location, and the linkage combined to eliminate flex in the fork blades and frame stays. This brake also featured the linear spring he invented, now used on almost all V-Brakes today. The cam was eventually replaced with the Lever Link.

==Competitive career==

Cunningham raced competitively in 1984, placing 10th overall at the NORBA championships in [[Nederland, Colorado]]. He became National Vet Champion aged 36.

Cunningham built a total of 187 aluminum bicycles (the Indian, the Racer, and the Wombat for smaller people) between 1979â€“1992. They were guaranteed for life, and cost about six times as much as custom (steel) bikes. He is now a freelance inventor working on environmentally sustainable projects.
