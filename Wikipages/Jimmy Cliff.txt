'''James Chambers''' [[Jamaican Order of Merit|OM]] (born 30 July 1944), known professionally as '''Jimmy Cliff''', is a Jamaican [[ska]], [[rocksteady]], [[reggae]] and soul musician, multi-instrumentalist, singer, and actor. He is the only living reggae musician to hold the [[Jamaican Order of Merit|Order of Merit]], the highest honour that can be granted by the Jamaican government for achievements in the arts and sciences. 

Cliff is best known among [[mainstream]] audiences for songs such as "Wonderful World, Beautiful People", "[[Many Rivers to Cross]]", "[[You Can Get It If You Really Want]]", "[[The Harder They Come (song)|The Harder They Come]]", "[[Reggae Night]]", and "[[Hakuna Matata (song)|Hakuna Matata]]", and his [[cover version|covers]] of [[Cat Stevens]]'s "[[Wild World (song)|Wild World]]" and [[Johnny Nash]]'s "[[I Can See Clearly Now]]" from the film ''[[Cool Runnings]]''.

Cliff was one of five performers inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2010.

==Early life and education==
Jimmy Cliff was born James Chambers on 30 July 1944 in [[Saint James Parish, Jamaica|Saint James]], [[Colony of Jamaica]].<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|last=Greene|first=Jo-Ann|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/jimmy-cliff-mn0000295276/biography|title=Jimmy Cliff Biography|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=30 August 2020}}</ref> He began writing songs while still at primary school in St. James, listening to a neighbour's sound system. When Chambers was 14, his father took him to [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], where he would take up the stage name Jimmy Cliff.<ref name="Thompson">{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Dave |title=Reggae & Caribbean Music |year=2002 |publisher=Backbeat Books |isbn=0-87930-655-6|page=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ARrDQKqFo7AC&q=jimmy+cliff+somerton|via=Google Books}}</ref>

==Career==
===1960s and 1970s===
Cliff sought out many producers while still going to school, trying to get his songs recorded without success. He also entered talent contests. "One night I was walking past a record store and restaurant as they were closing, pushed myself in and convinced one of them, [[Leslie Kong]], to go into the recording business, starting with me," he writes in his own website biography.<ref name="Larkin"/> After two singles that failed to make much impression, his career took off when "Hurricane Hattie" became a hit while he was aged 14.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |first= Jo-Ann| last= Greene |url= http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jimmy-cliff-mn0000295276/biography |title=Jimmy Cliff Biography |publisher=AllMusic|access-date= 2012-12-23 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914060404/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jimmy-cliff-mn0000295276/biography |archive-date=14 September 2013}}</ref> It was produced by Kong, with whom Cliff remained until Kong's death from a heart attack in 1971.

Cliff's later local hit singles included "King of Kings", "Dearest Beverley", "Miss Jamaica", and "Pride and Passion". In 1964, Cliff was chosen as one of Jamaica's representatives at the [[1964 New York World's Fair|World's Fair]] in New York; and in the same year Cliff was featured in a program called "This is [[Ska]]!" alongside [[Prince Buster]], [[Toots and the Maytals]], and [[Byron Lee and the Dragonaires]].<ref>Jw31209.

It received excellent reviews and included "Waterfall" (composed by [[Nirvana (British band)|Nirvana]]'s Alex Spyropoulos and [[Patrick Campbell-Lyons]]), which became a hit in Brazil and won the International Song Festival.<ref name="AMG"/>

"Waterfall" was followed in 1969 by "Wonderful World, Beautiful People" and "Vietnam" in 1970, both popular throughout most of the world. [[Bob Dylan]] called "Vietnam" the best [[protest song]] he had ever heard.<ref name="Larkin"/> Also during this period, Cliff released a [[cover version|cover]] of [[Cat Stevens]]' "[[Wild World (song)|Wild World]]" as a single, but it was not included on his ''[[Wonderful World, Beautiful People]]'' album.

In 1972, Cliff starred as Ivanhoe "Ivan" Martin in the classic reggae film, ''[[The Harder They Come]]'', directed by [[Perry Henzell]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0070155/ |title=The Harder They Come (1972) |publisher=IMDb |access-date=2012-12-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222040855/http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0070155/ |archive-date=22 February 2012}}</ref> As the film tells Martin's story, he is a young man without funds. Arriving in Kingston from the country, he tries to make it in the recording business, but without success. Eventually, he turns to a life of crime. The soundtrack album of the film was a huge success that sold well across the world, bringing reggae to an international audience for the first time. It remains one of the most internationally significant films to have come out of Jamaica since independence. The film made its debut at London's [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]] cinema in [[Notting Hill]] on 1 September 1972.<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years 1">{{cite book| first= John| last= Tobler| year= 1992| title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years| edition= 1st| publisher= Reed International Books Ltd| location= London| page= 242| id= CN 5585}}</ref> In 1975, Cliff sang on the [[Saturday Night Live (season 1)|first season]] of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', episode 12, hosted by [[Dick Cavett]]. After a series of albums, Cliff took a break and traveled to Africa (the Nigeria-based Jamaican writer [[Lindsay Barrett]] was instrumental in Cliff's first trip there),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecaribzone.com/entertainment.php |title=Jimmy Cliff planning sequel to The Harder They Come |work=The Caribzone |publisher=thecaribzone.com |date=2009-11-24 |access-date=2014-04-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502001942/http://www.thecaribzone.com/entertainment.php |archive-date=2 May 2014}}</ref> and subsequently converted to [[Islam]], taking the new name: El Hadj Naïm Bachir.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lastfm.fr/music/Jimmy+Cliff |title=Jimmy Cliff – Découvrez de la musique, des vidéos, des concerts, des stats, & des photos sur Last.fm |publisher=lastfm.fr |access-date=2012-08-13 |language=fr |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120913194645/http://www.lastfm.fr/music/Jimmy+Cliff |archive-date=13 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.purepeople.com/people/jimmy-cliff_p1302#biography |title=Jimmy Cliff - Toute l'actu ! |website= PurePeople.com |access-date=2012-08-13 |language=fr |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121020000946/http://www.purepeople.com/people/jimmy-cliff_p1302#biography |archive-date=20 October 2012}}</ref>

===1980s and 1990s===
Cliff quickly returned to music, touring for several years before he recorded with [[Kool & the Gang]]. In 1984, Cliff appeared at the [[Pinkpop Festival]] in [[Landgraaf]], [[Netherlands]]. During [[The River Tour]], [[Bruce Springsteen]] and the [[E Street Band]] added Cliff's previously little-known song "[[Trapped (Bruce Springsteen song)|Trapped]]" to their live set; it achieved great prominence when included on 1985's ''[[We Are the World (album)|We Are the World]]'' benefit album. The follow-up, ''[[Cliff Hanger (album)|Cliff Hanger]]'' (1985), won a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for '[[Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album|Best Reggae Album]]', though it was his last major success in the United States until 1993. Also in 1985, Cliff contributed to the song "[[Sun City (song)|Sun City]]", a protest song written and composed by [[Steven Van Zandt]] and recorded by [[Artists United Against Apartheid]] to convey opposition to the [[South Africa]]n policy of [[apartheid]].<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years 2">{{cite book| first= John| last= Tobler| year= 1992| title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years| edition= 1st| publisher= Reed International Books Ltd| location= London| page= 409| id= CN 5585}}</ref> Cliff then provided [[backing vocalist|backing vocals]] on [[The Rolling Stones]]' 1986 album ''[[Dirty Work (The Rolling Stones album)|Dirty Work]]'', and appeared in the comedy ''[[Club Paradise]]'', co-starring with [[Robin Williams]] and [[Peter O'Toole]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0090856/ |title=Club Paradise (1986) |publisher=IMDb |access-date=2012-12-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222040937/http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0090856/ |archive-date=22 February 2012}}</ref> and contributed several songs to the soundtrack, including "Seven Day Weekend", which he sang with [[Elvis Costello]].

In 2001, Cliff became an inaugural member of the Independent Music Awards' judging panel to support independent artists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/imajudges2002.asp |title=Independent Music Awards - 1st Annual Judges |publisher=independentmusicawards.com |access-date=2012-12-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130329150729/http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/imajudges2002.asp |archive-date= 29 March 2013 }}</ref> In 2002, Cliff released the album ''Fantastic Plastic People'' in Europe, after first providing free downloads using [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|p2p]] software. This album featured collaborations with [[Joe Strummer]], [[Annie Lennox]], and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] as well as new songs that were very reminiscent of Cliff's original hits. In 2004, Cliff completely reworked the songs, dropping the traditional reggae in favour of an [[electronic music|electronic]] sound, for inclusion in ''Black Magic''. The album also included a recording of "Over the Border" with [[Joe Strummer]]. Cliff performed at the closing ceremony to the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]] and in 2003, his song "You Can Get It If You Really Want" was included in the soundtrack to the film, ''[[Something's Gotta Give (film)|Something's Gotta Give]]''.

Patterson]] honoured Cliff on 20 October 2003, by awarding him [[Jamaican Order of Merit|The Order of Merit]], the nation's fourth-highest honour, in recognition of his contributions to the film and music of Jamaica. Cliff and [[Mervyn Morris]] are the only currently living figures from the arts to hold this distinction and Cliff is the only living musician to do so.

In 2007, Cliff performed at the opening ceremony at cricket's [[2007 Cricket World Cup|World Cup]]. In the spring and summer of 2010, Cliff embarked on an extensive tour of the U.S. and Canada.
