==Early life==

==Musical style==
A.CHAL's music generally fits into the hip hop and R&B genres. ''[[USA Today]]'' has described his music as falling somewhere "in the negative space between Hip-Hop, R&B, [[chillwave]], and pop music."<ref name="USA"/> A.CHAL himself has described his music's genre as [[Soul music|soul]].<ref name="XXL"/> His sound has also been characterized as "sedated", "hazy", and "almost-psychedelic".<ref name="Remezcla"/><ref name="PP2015"/><ref name="HB">{{cite news | last=Montes| first=Patrick| title =A.Chal – Round Whippin| work =HypeBeast| date =June 23, 2015 | url =http://hypebeast.com/2015/06/a-chal-round-whippin| accessdate =December 5, 2016}}</ref> ''Remezcla'' has called his voice "sultry, sparse, and desperate".<ref name="Remezcla"/>

Lyrically, he largely discusses anecdotal experiences. Writing about his 2016 album ''Welcome to GAZI'', Jules Muir of ''Pigeons & Planes'' noted that A.CHAL attempts to cut "to the core of many of society's ills and triumphs by tapping into a deep well of personal experiences and anecdotes."<ref name="PP2016"/>
