==History==

===Formation and first releases (2005–2006)===

The Devil Wears Prada was founded during 2005 in [[Dayton Ohio]];<ref name="allmusic">{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p822710}}</ref> they derived their band name from [[The Devil Wears Prada (novel)|the story of the same title]].<ref name="highwiredaze.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.highwiredaze.com/thedevilwearprada.htm|title=The Devil Wears Prada &gt; Biography|work=High Wire Daze|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226194455/http://www.highwiredaze.com/thedevilwearprada.htm|archive-date=February 26, 2012}}</ref> Being founded with all Christian members and maintaining a theme that represents their religion, the group played their first show in 2005 with a fill-in bassist and only one guitarist. Rhythm guitarist Jeremy Depoyster and bassist Andy Trick joined the band soon afterward. They continued playing at local areas in Dayton before recording their demo later in the year which was titled ''Patterns of a Horizon''.<ref name=desertnews>{{cite web|last=Scott|first=Iwasaki|title=Metalcore band 'The Devil Wears Prada' spreads Christian message|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700015813/Metalcore-band-The-Devil-Wears-Prada-spreads-Christian-message.html|work=Deseret News|access-date=July 18, 2011}}</ref>

One year after the group recorded their demo and trialed for record labels, [[Rise Records]] took the band in with a contract. The band was unsatisfied with the demo so they re-recorded all of the tracks from the demo for their debut full-length album, ''[[Dear Love: A Beautiful Discord]]''. The album was recorded with [[Joey Sturgis]], at The Foundation Recording Studio held in [[Connersville, Indiana]] and it was released on August 22, 2006. The record's final track features guest vocals, courtesy of Cole Wallace who was formerly part of the band [[Gwen Stacy (band)|Gwen Stacy]]. With the release of the album, the band then began touring in multiple areas throughout the country, most notably at 2006's [[Cornerstone Festival]] after being recognized as a newer key musical group to Christian metal.

===''Plagues'' (2006–2008)===

With ''Dear Love'' released at the end of the summer of 2006, The Devil Wears Prada already had songs for their second album prepared by winter of the same year. With a recording duration lasting from that time and leading into spring of 2007, the band's second album, ''[[Plagues (album)|Plagues]]'' met its completion by the summer and was released on August 21, 2007. The demo version of their song "HTML Rulez D00d" was placed on the band's Myspace profile on January 1, 2007 for promotion of the record and on July 11, [[AbsolutePunk]] began to stream their song "Don't Dink and Drance", which led to further exposure for the band.<ref name="AbsolutePunk">{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=250178|title=The Devil Wears Prada track listing |last=Foucart|first=Jon|work=[[AbsolutePunk]]}}</ref>

The songs from the album "HTML Rulez D00d" and "Hey John, What's Your Name Again?" were released as the album's two singles, both of which spawned music videos that aired on television channels such as MTV and [[Fuse TV|Fuse]]. ''Plagues'' peaked at No.&nbsp;57 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] on September 8, 2007<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the devil wears prada|chart=all}} Discography index] ''Billboard'' 200</ref> and has been considered a great success since its original release, selling more than 30,000 copies more than their debut album, ''[[Dear Love: A Beautiful Discord]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interpunk.com/item.cfm?Item=149863& |title='&#39;Plagues'&#39; at |publisher=Interpunk.com |access-date=January 1, 2012}}</ref> It was re-released on October 28, 2008 in a [[digipak]] form that includes a DVD in which features the music videos for album's two singles as well as footage of The Devil Wears Prada playing at 2008's [[Warped Tour]] and Ultimatour. Later in the year, the band was interviewed by East Coast Romper, and stated that their primary influences are [[Underoath]] and [[Still Remains]], which was mistaken on their official website due to it incorrectly stating that they were not influenced by these bands. The band recorded a cover of the rap song "[[Still Fly]]", originally written and performed by [[Big Tymers]], the cover song was released on the compilation album ''[[Punk Goes Crunk]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thealbumproject.net/2008/04/full-review-va-punk-goes-crunk/ |title=Full Review: V/A – Punk Goes Crunk |publisher=The Album Project |access-date=January 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20080704035817/http://thealbumproject.net/2008/04/full-review-va-punk-goes-crunk/ |archive-date=July 4, 2008 }}</ref>

By January 2011, Hranica revealed in an interview with Tim Karan what the band's ideas and plans for their fourth full-length studio album would be. His comments were placed within comparison to their latest release (the ''Zombie'' EP and described that the record is "a more heavy-focused sound from us. We think it would be smart to push that beefy, heavy songwriting [from ''Zombie''] into the new full-length...but with a strong blend of what we usually do with melody." The album was confirmed to not be a [[concept album]] – like their previous work on the ''Zombie'' EP – but would have an overall theme, focused on anti-[[idolatry]], which, according to Hranica, "has been weighing on me lately."<ref>''The Devil Wears Prada'' • January 2011 — ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]''</ref> On June 13, ''Alternative Press'' began streaming a track, titled "Born to Lose", debuting off the upcoming album, and during the same month, the band signed with [[Roadrunner Records]].<ref name="Roadrunner">{{cite web|title=THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA Signs With ROADRUNNER RECORDS – June 21, 2011|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=159710|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=October 7, 2011}}</ref> Vocalist, Hrancia offered his opinion of the new material, stating that it will contain "the heavy aspects of the ''Zombie'' EP, meshed with the melody of the full-lengths. ‘Born to Lose’ captures some of those elements and serves as a comprehensive preview to the album."

==Musical style and influences==
Some sources described the band, and their works, were in their early years described as "metalcore".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/the-devil-wears-prada/album/with-roots-above-and-branches-below |title=With Roots Above And Branches Below : The Devil Wears Prada |publisher=Rhapsody}}</ref><ref name="LoudwireThrone" /> According to Audio Ink Radio, "by fusing the finest elements of American metal-core and European melodic metal, Dayton, Ohio's the Devil Wears Prada are living the heavy music dream: delivering metal with a slight facelift to the next generation of headbangers."<ref name = "audioinkradiothrone" /> The band members' beliefs, and the themes in their music, also led to their genre being described as "Christian metalcore".<ref name=desertnews />

In 2021, Sipress stated in a Reddit AUA in response to a question as to whether they still considered their music to be Christian based that, "we have not promoted the band a being Christian for a looong time. Most of us aren't Christians, but we do aim at writing music that is fun to play!".<ref>{{cite web|title=Hi we’re The Devil Wears Prada and just released our ZII EP, Ask Us Anything!|publisher=The Devil Wears Prada via [[reddit.com]]|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Metalcore/comments/nk6unr/hi_were_the_devil_wears_prada_and_just_released/gzbdwy2/|date=May 25, 2021|accessdate=May 27, 2021}}</ref><!-- Such a source is reliable, see [[WP:SOCIALMEDIA]] -->

==Band name==
Despite speculations that the band named themselves after [[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|the film of the same title]], it turned out that they were formed before the film was released. They have explained that their band name is based on an anti-materialistic mindset and derived their name from [[The Devil Wears Prada (novel)|the novel, ''The Devil Wears Prada'']]. At the time of naming the band, the members assumed that the novel included anti-materialism as its moral, until later discovering that the novel did not feature this as its message at all.<ref name="highwiredaze.com"/> Despite making this mistake, the band members refused to change the name and decided that they would create a new, [[materialism|non-materialistic]] definition indicating that at the [[Last Judgment]], God will not look at people's possessions.<ref name="highwiredaze.com"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://artists.letssingit.com/the-devil-wears-prada-6g9zn/biography |title=The Devil Wears Prada Biography |publisher=Artists.letssingit.com |date=May 28, 2013 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref>
