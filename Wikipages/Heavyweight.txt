==Boxing==
===Professional===
Boxers who weigh over {{convert|200|lb|kg stlb|lk=in}} are considered heavyweights by 3 of the 4 major professional boxing organizations: the [[International Boxing Federation]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iboboxing.com/ibo_championship_rules_and_regulations.html |work=IBO and also the sink board of control.

====Historical development====
Because this division had no weight limit, it has been historically vaguely defined. In the 19th century, for example, many [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|heavyweight champions]] weighed {{convert|170|lb|kg stlb}} or less (although others weighed 200 pounds).

In 1920, the light heavyweight division was formed, with a maximum weight of {{convert|175|lb|kg stlb}}. Any fighter weighing more than 175 pounds was a heavyweight.  The cruiserweight division (first for boxers in the 175–190 pound range) was established in 1979 and recognized by the various boxing organizations in the 1980s with a maximum weight of either {{convert|190|lb|kg stlb}} or {{convert|195|lb|kg stlb}}. Later these organizations increased the cruiserweight limit to 200 pounds.

Since 1975, the [[Amateur Athletic Union of the United States]] and the Soviet Sports Committee established a new concept in international boxing, called "Heavy Duals," an all-heavyweight team contest between the United States and the Soviet Union.<ref>'Heavy' Date, ''AAU News'', 1975, v. 45, p. 10.</ref>

As of 2021, [[Wladimir Klitschko]] holds record of most boxers beaten for the world heavyweight title, with 23.<ref name=business-insider-sg>{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.sg/wladimir-klitschko-plotting-boxing-comeback-2019-10|title=Wladimir Klitschko is plotting a spectacular boxing comeback, and he wants to break an old heavyweight record|last=Business Insider Singapore|website=businessinsider.sg}}</ref><ref name=boxing-records>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timesnews.net/Sports/2019/12/23/Sports-facts-that-may-surprise-you|title=Who knew?

Four boxers have regained the heavyweight title in an immediate rematch: [[Floyd Patterson]] in 1960, [[Muhammad Ali]] in 1978, [[Lennox Lewis]] in 2001, and [[Anthony Joshua]] in 2019. [[Mike Tyson]] holds the record for being the youngest heavyweight to ever achieve championship status, becoming champion at the age of 20. Tyson also became the first heavyweight to own all three major belts – WBA, WBC, and IBF as well as The Ring and lineal heavyweight titles at the same time.

==Professional wrestling==
The term "[[Professional wrestling championship|world heavyweight]]" in modern wrestling generally refers to a champion wrestler who is seen as a prominent competitor, rather than an adherent to a particular weight class. The World Heavyweight Championship in wrestling is usually considered the main title in a given promotion. Prior to the wrestling industry publicly acknowledging the predetermined nature of the sport, a Heavyweight title was generally competed for by larger wrestlers while smaller wrestlers competed as (among other names and classifications) "[[NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship|Junior Heavyweights]]" and "Light-Heavyweights".

==Analogous uses==
The word "heavyweight" is sometimes used in other fields (''e.g.'' politics) to denote a person who is especially powerful or influential. In this context, "big beast" has a similar meaning. Other boxing analogies include "punching above his [their] weight" to denote a person or entity (''e.g.'' a country) whose influence is arguably greater than his/its basic attributes would suggest.
