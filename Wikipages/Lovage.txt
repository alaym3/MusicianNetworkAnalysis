==Description==
[[File:Levisticum officinale 002.jpg|thumb|upright|Lovage flowers]]
Lovage is an erect, herbaceous, perennial plant growing to {{convert|1.8–2.5|m|ft|frac=2|abbr=on}} tall, with a basal rosette of leaves and stems with further leaves, the flowers being produced in umbels at the top of the stems. The stems and leaves are shiny [[glabrousness|glabrous]] green to yellow-green and smell somewhat similar to celery when crushed. The larger basal leaves are up to {{convert|70|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, tripinnate, with broad triangular to rhomboidal, acutely pointed leaflets with a few marginal teeth; the stem leaves are smaller, and less divided with few leaflets. The flowers are yellow to greenish-yellow, {{convert|2–3|mm|in|frac=16|abbr=on}} diameter, produced in globose umbels up to {{convert|10–15|cm|in|frac=2|abbr=on}} diameter; flowering is in late spring. The fruit is a dry two-parted [[schizocarp]] {{convert|4–7|mm|in|frac=16|abbr=on}} long, mature in autumn.<ref>Interactive Flora of NW Europe: [https://archive.today/20070621080912/http://ip30.eti.uva.nl/BIS/flora.php?selected=beschrijving&menuentry=soorten&id=3303 ''Levisticum officinale'' (Lovage)]</ref>

==Distribution==
The exact native range is disputed; some sources cite it as native to much of [[Europe]] and southwestern [[Asia]],<ref name="Virtuella">Den virtuella floran: [http://linnaeus.nrm.se/flora/di/apia/levis/levioff.html ''Levisticum officinale''] {{in lang|sv}}, with [http://linnaeus.nrm.se/flora/di/apia/levis/levioffv.jpg map]</ref> others from only the eastern Mediterranean region in southeastern Europe and southwestern Asia,<ref name="Huxley">{{cite book | editor = Huxley, A. | date = 1992 | title = New RHS Dictionary of Gardening | isbn = 0-333-47494-5}}</ref> and yet others only to southwestern Asia in [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]], citing European populations as [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalised]].<ref name="Blamey">{{cite book |author1=Blamey, M.  |author2=Grey-Wilson, C.  |name-list-style=amp | date = 1989 | title = Illustrated Flora of Britain and Northern Europe | isbn = 0-340-40170-2}}</ref><ref>{{GRIN | access-date = 11 December 2017}}</ref> It has been long cultivated in Europe, the [[leaf|leaves]] being used as an herb, the roots as a vegetable, and the seeds as a spice, especially in southern European cuisine.<ref name="Huxley"/>

==Properties and uses==
The [[leaves]] can be used in [[salad]]s, or to make [[soup]] or season broths, and the [[root]]s can be eaten as a [[vegetable]] or grated for use in salads. Its flavour and smell are reminiscent both of [[celery]] and [[parsley]], only more intense and spicy than those of either. The seeds can be used as a spice in the same way as [[fennel]] seeds.<ref name="Huxley"/>

<li>In [[Ukraine]], lovage (in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] любисток/liubystok), is an aphrodisiac.

Nowadays, you can buy hair conditioners which contain lovage extract to strengthen the hair. Lovage leaves and roots are also used in salads and as a spice in [[Ukraine]]. 
<li>In [[Romania]], the leaves are a preferred seasoning for the various local broths and are just as popular, in this respect, as parsley or [[dill]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://adevarul.ro/locale/arad/In-fel-ciorbe-indicat-folosim-leusteanul-multe-frunze-puternic-aromate-putem-pune-1_58ad5cad5ab6550cb8b4767b/index.html|title=În ce fel de ciorbe este indicat să folosim leuşteanul.

<li>In the [[UK]], an alcoholic lovage [[Liqueur|cordial]] is traditionally added to [[brandy]] as a [[winter]] drink and is or was popular in [[Cornwall]] where it was originally added to slightly spoiled smuggled brandy to hide the taste of salt.<ref>[http://www.farehamwinecellar.co.uk/0/4c7a5def1b38652380256a73004609dc.html Information on Lovage Cordial] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006225825/http://www.farehamwinecellar.co.uk/0/4c7a5def1b38652380256a73004609dc.html |date=2011-10-06 }}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[File:Unser Liebstöckel.jpg|thumb|upright|A lovage plant beginning to bloom in June, {{cvt|2.78|m|ftin}} tall]]
The name "lovage" is from "love-ache", ''ache'' being a medieval name for [[parsley]]; this is a [[folk etymology|folk-etymological]] corruption of the older French name {{Lang|fro|levesche}}, from late Latin {{Lang|la|levisticum}}, in turn thought to be a corruption of the earlier Latin {{Lang|la|ligusticum}}, 'of [[Liguria]]' (northwest Italy), where the herb was grown extensively.<ref name="OED">{{cite OED|term=lovage|id=110562}}</ref> In modern botanical usage, both Latin forms are now used for different (but closely related) genera, with ''Levisticum'' for (culinary) lovage, and ''[[Ligusticum]]'' for Scots lovage, a similar species from northern Europe, and for related species.<ref name="OED"/>
