After a fifteen-year hiatus from the group, he was re-united with Take That on 15 July 2010, co-writing and performing lead vocals on their album ''[[Progress (Take That album)|Progress]],'' which became the second fastest-selling album in UK chart history<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.news.yahoo.com/22/20101121/tuk-uk-britain-music-charts-fa6b408.html|title=Yahoo News UK & Ireland – Latest World News & UK News Headlines|date=20 April 2011|publisher=Uk.news.yahoo.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124175807/http://uk.news.yahoo.com/22/20101121/tuk-uk-britain-music-charts-fa6b408.html|archive-date=24 November 2010|url-status=dead|access-date=24 April 2014}}</ref> and the fastest-selling record of the century at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a288057/take-that-lp-posts-huge-sales.html|title=Take That LP posts huge sales|date=16 November 2010|work=Digital Spy|access-date=2 October 2011}}</ref> The [[Progress Live|subsequent stadium tour]], which featured seven songs from Williams's solo career, became the biggest-selling concert in UK history, selling 1.34 million tickets in less than 24 hours.

==Early life and education ==
Williams was born on 13 February 1974 in [[Stoke-on-Trent]], Staffordshire, England. His parents, Janet (''[[née]]'' Farrell) and Peter Williams (also known as Pete Conway), ran a pub called the Red Lion in [[Burslem]], before his father became the licensee at the [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale FC]] Social Club; this led to Williams' lifelong affinity for the team.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sherwin|first=Phil|title=The Port Vale Miscellany|publisher=The History Press|location=Brimscombe Port|year=2010|page=10|isbn=978-0-7524-5777-2}}</ref> His maternal grandfather was Irish and hailed from [[Kilkenny]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kclr96fm.com/news/robbie-williams-grandfather-came-from-kilkenny/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915121421/http://kclr96fm.com/news/robbie-williams-grandfather-came-from-kilkenny/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 September 2012 |title=Robbie Williams grandfather came from Kilkenny |publisher=KCLR96FM |date=12 September 2012 |access-date=28 June 2013}}</ref> Williams attended [[St Margaret Ward Catholic School]] in [[Tunstall, Staffordshire|Tunstall]],<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/news/Robbie-doing-kids-awards/article-339261-detail/article.html | title=Robbie doing it for the kids with awards | date=19 September 2008 | newspaper=[[The Sentinel (Staffordshire)|The Sentinel]] | access-date=8 August 2010 }}</ref> before attending dance school UKDDF in Tunstall. He participated in several school plays, and his biggest role was that of the [[Artful Dodger]] in a production of ''[[Oliver!]]'', the musical adaptation of the [[Charles Dickens]] novel ''[[Oliver Twist]]''.<ref>[https://www.nzherald.co.nz/northern-advocate/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503444&objectid=11004700 "Robbie Williams: The ego has flown"].

==Take That==
{{Main|Take That}}

===1990–1995: first stint===

In 1990, the sixteen-year-old Williams was the youngest member to join Take That. According to the documentary ''[[Take That: For the Record]]'', his mother read an advertisement seeking members for a new boy band and suggested that he try out for the group. He met fellow member [[Mark Owen]] on the day of his audition/interview with [[Nigel Martin-Smith]]. Although the majority of the group's material was written and performed by [[Gary Barlow]], Williams performed lead vocals on their first Top Ten hit "[[Could It Be Magic]]", as well as "[[I Found Heaven]]", and "[[Everything Changes (Take That song)|Everything Changes]]". Williams' use of [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and [[cocaine]] brought him into conflict with Martin-Smith over the behaviour rules for Take That members.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1479447/Robbie-Drugs-gave-me-best-times-of-my-life.html "Robbie: 'Drugs gave me best times of my life']. The Telegraph. Retrieved 14 June 2018</ref>

In November 1994, Williams's drug abuse had escalated; he had a near drug overdose the night before the group was scheduled to perform at the [[MTV Europe Music Awards]].<ref name="Robbie Williams early career">{{cite web|title=Robbie Williams early career|url=http://www.starpulse.com/Music/Williams,_Robbie/Biography/|work=Discographies, biographies, news|publisher=StarPulse.com|access-date=19 March 2013}}</ref> According to the documentary ''For the Record'', he was unhappy with his musical ideas not being taken seriously by lead singer Barlow and Martin-Smith; his desire to explore [[hip hop]] and [[rap (music)|rap]] conflicted with Take That's usual ballads. Barlow explained in interviews that Williams had given up trying to offer creative input.

Noting Williams' increasingly belligerent behaviour and poor attendance at rehearsals, and worried that he might leave the group during their upcoming tour, Orange and Barlow took their concerns to Martin-Smith. During one of the last rehearsals before the tour commenced, the three confronted Williams about his attitude and stated they wanted to do the tour without him. He agreed to quit and left the group in July 1995; it would be the last time for twelve years that they were all together. Despite the departure of Williams, Take That completed their [[Nobody Else Tour]] as a four-piece. They later disbanded on 13 February 1996, Williams's 22nd birthday.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/broken-promises-as-take-that-can-take-no-more-1318879.html "Broken promises as Take That can take no more"]. Independent. Retrieved 14 June 2018</ref>

Shortly afterwards, Williams was photographed by the press partying with the members of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] at [[Glastonbury Festival]]. Following his departure, he became the subject of talk shows and newspapers as he acknowledged his plans to become a solo singer, and he was spotted partying with [[George Michael]] in France. However, a clause in his Take That contract prohibited him from releasing any material until after the group was officially dissolved, and he was later sued by Martin-Smith and forced to pay $200,000 in commission. After various legal battles over his right to a solo career, Williams succeeded in getting released from his contract with [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]. On 27 June 1996, Williams signed with [[Chrysalis Records]].

===2006–2011: second stint===
[[File:Robbie Williams at Sunderland 2011a crop.jpg|thumb|210px|Williams performing in Take That's [[Progress Live]] tour in 2011. He rejoined the group in July 2010 and is open to another reunion in the future.]]

By March 2009, Williams had shown interest in rejoining [[Take That]];<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/5058174/Robbie-Williams-ready-to-rejoin-Take-That.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401165545/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/5058174/Robbie-Williams-ready-to-rejoin-Take-That.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=1 April 2009 |title=Robbie Williams ready to rejoin Take That|work=The Daily Telegraph |date=27 March 2009 |access-date=23 December 2009 | location=London}}</ref> however, the band completed their [[The Circus Live]] without him. In spite of rumours that Williams was working in [[New York City|New York]] with Take That in September that year,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/robbie-williams/47535 |title=Robbie Williams and Take That reunite in New York studio? &#124; News |publisher=Nme.Com |date=28 September 2009 |access-date=24 April 2014}}</ref> by the day of the [[Children in Need]] charity concert at [[The Royal Albert Hall]] in November they were still performing separately. However, both did join with the other acts in the final song of the evening, with Williams putting his arm around Gary Barlow and singing "[[Hey Jude]]".

On 15 July 2010, Williams reconciled with his former colleagues and rejoined Take That. In November 2010 the Take That album ''[[Progress (Take That album)|Progress]]'' was released, becoming the fastest selling album since 2000 and the second fastest selling album in UK history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestudentpocketguide.com/interviews/Take_That |title=Take That Interview &#124; Student Pocket Guide Online |publisher=Thestudentpocketguide.com |access-date=2 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930032541/http://www.thestudentpocketguide.com/interviews/Take_That |archive-date=30 September 2011 }}</ref> The group travelled across the UK on their [[Progress Live]] tour, which included eight nights at [[Wembley Stadium]] in London,<ref name="wembleystadium.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.wembleystadium.com/pressbox/pressReleases/take-that-sold-out |title=Archived copy |access-date=6 February 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228171126/http://www.wembleystadium.com/pressbox/pressReleases/take-that-sold-out |archive-date=28 December 2010 }}</ref> then continued across Europe. The tour was the fastest selling in UK history with ticket hotlines and websites crashing under the demand.<ref name="wembleystadium.com"/>

In August 2012, Take That performed at the [[2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]] of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]]. Williams was due to perform with Take That but missed the performance because his wife gave birth at around the same time; the group performed as a four-piece.<ref>{{cite web|author=Paul Martinovic|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a386293/take-that-george-michael-to-feature-in-london-2012-closing-ceremony.html |title=Take That, George Michael to feature in London 2012 closing ceremony}}</ref>

{{Main|Life thru a Lens|I've Been Expecting You}}
Williams launched his solo career in 1996 with a cover of [[George Michael]]'s "[[Freedom (Robbie Williams song)|Freedom]]", which reached number two in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="8notes">{{cite web|url=http://www.8notes.com/biographies/robbie_williams.asp |title=Robbie Williams |publisher=8notes.com |access-date=23 December 2009}}</ref> Recordings for Williams's first album began at London's Maison Rouge studios in March 1997. Shortly after his introduction to songwriter and producer [[Guy Chambers]], Williams released "[[Old Before I Die]]", the first single from his debut album. The single reached number two on the UK Charts;<ref name="8notes" /> however, it was largely ignored on international charts. His debut album, ''[[Life thru a Lens]]'', was released in September 1997. The album launched with his first live solo gig at the [[Élysée Montmartre]] theatre in Paris, France. The album debuted at number eleven on the [[UK Albums Chart]].

===2002–2005: ''Escapology'' and ''Intensive Care''===
{{Main|Escapology (album)|Greatest Hits (Robbie Williams album)|Intensive Care (album)}}
In 2002, Williams signed a record-breaking £80&nbsp;million contract with EMI.<ref>{{cite news |title=Robbie signs '£80m' deal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2291605.stm|work=BBC News |date=2 October 2002}}</ref> The contract included a number of provisos, including the label ceding greater creative control to the artist and a commitment to breaking Williams into the US market. So far it is the biggest music deal in British history. The deal was brokered by [[Ingenious Media]], a UK corporate finance advisory business. Williams began working on what would be his fifth studio album, spending a year in the recording studio. The album heralded a new era for Williams. He had taken a more active role in the making of this album.  "One Fine Day", "Nan's Song", and "[[Come Undone (Robbie Williams song)|Come Undone]]" were the first songs that Williams wrote without the input of Guy Chambers. Most of the songs were recorded in Los Angeles.

The album's first single, "[[Feel (Robbie Williams song)|Feel]]", written by Williams and Chambers, was recorded as a demo. When they started working on the album and were trying to re-record the vocals, Williams felt unsatisfied with it, so he decided to include the demo version and then release it as the first single. When the single was released in late 2002, it became Williams' biggest international hit, going number one in The Netherlands and Italy, as well as reaching the top ten in many European countries.<ref>{{cite web |title=Robbie Williams – Feel (Single) |url=http://www.dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Robbie+Williams&titel=Feel&cat=s |publisher=GfK Dutch Charts |access-date=17 December 2015 }}</ref> When Williams' fifth studio album, ''[[Escapology (album)|Escapology]]'', was released in late 2002, it hit number one in at least 10 countries around the world. In the United States, however, it failed to make such an impact. ''Escapology'' sold almost 2&nbsp;million copies by the end of 2003 in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/platinum/platinumright.asp?rq=search_plat&r_id=30860 |title=Platinum Awards Content |date=30 September 2007 |access-date=24 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618162807/http://www.bpi.co.uk/platinum/platinumright.asp?rq=search_plat&r_id=30860 |archive-date=18 June 2008 }}</ref> On 1–3 August 2003, Williams played three consecutive [[Concerts at Knebworth House|concerts at Knebworth]] to 125,000 people each night, making it the biggest event in UK music history.<ref name="Knebworth"/> Memorable performances included "Come Undone" where he interjected with "Britain, I'm Your Son", and further interacted with the audience when he brought a girl up on stage.<ref>[https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/seven-great-robbie-williams-live-7372033 "Are you ready for Robbie?

In October 2004, Williams released, ''[[Greatest Hits (Robbie Williams album)|Greatest Hits]]'', a retrospective of his career, and also, to reveal the new tracks he had been working on with the then-new collaborator, [[Stephen Duffy]]. "[[Radio (Robbie Williams song)|Radio]]", the compilation's first single, debuted at number one in the [[UK Singles Chart]]<ref name="UK Top 40 Database" /> (becoming Williams' sixth number-one hit). When the compilation was later released it debuted at number one in the UK<ref name="UK Top 40 Database" /> and was the best selling album of the year in the UK<ref name="timesonline.co.uk" /> and Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/plat2006.html |title=IFPI Platinum Europe Awards – 2006 |publisher=IFPI |year=2006}}</ref> Eight years after the release of "Angels", the British public voted it as the "Best Single of the Past Twenty-Five Years" at the [[2005 Brit Awards]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/news/brits2005/wdyt_2.shtml |title=Brits25: Did your favourites get awards? |publisher=BBC |date=9 February 2005}}</ref>

After touring Latin America in late 2004 for the promotion ''Greatest Hits'', Williams started working on his sixth studio album. Recorded at his house in the [[Hollywood Hills]], the album was co-written by [[Stephen Duffy]] over the course of 24 months. The album ''[[Intensive Care (album)|Intensive Care]]'' was launched in Berlin on 9 October. It became an international hit. In November 2005, Williams took home the [[MTV Europe Music Awards|MTV Europe Music Award]] for 'Best Male', but also, entered in ''[[The Guinness Book of World Records]]'' when he announced his World Tour for 2006, selling 1.6&nbsp;million tickets in one single day.<ref name="sp-13394">{{cite news|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Robbie-Williams-Enters-The-Guinness-Book-of-World-Records-13394.shtml |title=Robbie Williams Enters The Guinness Book of World Records |date=26 November 2005 |publisher=Softpedia |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006151507/http://news.softpedia.com/news/Robbie-Williams-Enters-The-Guinness-Book-of-World-Records-13394.shtml |archive-date=6 October 2014 }}</ref> Williams kicked off his ''[[Close Encounters Tour|Close Encounters World Tour]]'' in South Africa in April 2006, when he finished his European leg of the tour. 2.5&nbsp;million people had seen the show, and after touring Latin America and Australia the numbers went up to 3&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web |work=Time |url=http://www.emimusic.com.mx/portal/hgxpp001.aspx?{{formatnum:224135}},O,S,0,PAG;CONC;26;2;D;372970;1;PAG;, |title=EMI Music Mexico |publisher=Emimusic.com.mx |access-date=23 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019102950/http://www.emimusic.com.mx/portal/hgxpp001.aspx?%7B%7Bformatnum%3A224135%7D%7D%2CO%2CS%2C0%2CPAG%3BCONC%3B26%3B2%3BD%3B372970%3B1%3BPAG%3B%2C |archive-date=19 October 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Williams released his much anticipated dance/electro album, ''[[Rudebox (album)|Rudebox]]'', on 23 October 2006. It featured collaborations with the [[Pet Shop Boys]], [[William Orbit]], Soul Mekanik, [[Joey Negro]], [[Mark Ronson]], Chris Grierson, and The Orr Boys. It received mixed reviews: Allmusic gave it a four star rating, the ''[[NME]]'' 8 out of 10, and Music Week and MOJO were equally positive,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/robbie-williams/8052 |title=NME Magazine on "Rudebox" |work=NME |location=UK  |date=23 October 2006 |access-date=23 December 2009}}</ref> but it received much weaker reviews from some of the British press.

Williams has a strong interest in [[UFO]]s and related [[paranormal]] phenomena, and has pursued this interest during his 2007–08 sabbatical.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Ronson |title=I'm loving aliens instead |url=http://music.guardian.co.uk/pop/story/0,,2274878,00.html |work=The Guardian |date=19 April 2008 |access-date=19 April 2008 | location=London}}</ref> His interest in the subject led to him taking part in a documentary for [[BBC Radio 4]] with [[Jon Ronson]]. The documentary followed them to a UFO convention in [[Nevada]] during which Williams connected his interest in the paranormal with the desire to understand his childhood fears of his mother's interest in "the world's mysteries, elves, demons, witchcraft".<ref>{{cite book|last=Ronson|first=Jon|title=Lost at Sea: The Jon Ronson Mysteries|publisher=Riverhead Hardcover|year=2012|page=[https://archive.org/details/lostatseajonrons00jonr/page/94 94]|isbn=978-1594631375|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/lostatseajonrons00jonr/page/94}}</ref> In 2020, he also expressed his belief in the [[Pizzagate conspiracy theory]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-06-25|title=Robbie Williams suggests debunked Pizzagate conspiracy theory is true|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/robbie-williams-suggests-debunked-pizzagate-conspiracy-theory-is-true-the-right-questions-havent-been-asked-2695635|access-date=2021-03-18|website=NME|language=en-GB}}</ref>
