The band is currently signed to [[Kscope]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centurymedia.com/artist.aspx?IdArtist=330 |title=Century Media Records - TesseracT |publisher=Centurymedia.com |access-date=2014-07-12}}</ref> They are credited as one of the bands to pioneer the [[djent]] movement in progressive metal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tricolortimes.com/1244/a-e/the-sound-of-tesseract/|title=The Sound of Tesseract|last=Serrato|first=Diego|website=Tri-Color Times|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref> As of 2018, Tesseract have released four studio albums: ''[[One (Tesseract album)|One]]'', ''[[Altered State (Tesseract album)|Altered State]]'', ''[[Polaris (Tesseract album)|Polaris]]'' and ''[[Sonder (album)|Sonder]],'' as well as a live album, ''Odyssey/Scala'', and the extended plays ''[[Concealing Fate]]'', ''[[Perspective (EP)|Perspective]]'' and ''Errai''.

==History==
===Early years (2003–2009)===
Tesseract started out in 2003 while founding member Acle Kahney was recording and writing with his band Mikaw Barish. Kahney was also involved in the unofficial predecessor to Tesseract, [[Fellsilent]]. French vocalist Julien Perier supplied vocals during Tesseract's early stages, but the logistical difficulties of distance meant that he could not join the band permanently. After their first full lineup was realized, Tesseract began playing live shows and compiling material for their debut album; they released a three-song demo in 2007 containing parts of what would eventually become their debut album, ''[[One (Tesseract album)|One]]''.

===''One'' (2009–2011)===
In 2009, the original lead vocalist, Abisola Obasanya, left the band and was replaced by Daniel Tompkins.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hangout.altsounds.com/news/112121-dan-tompkins-announced-tesseract-front-man.html |title=Dan Tompkins announced as the new TesseracT front man - #AltSounds |publisher=Hangout.altsounds.com |access-date=2014-07-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927030808/http://hangout.altsounds.com/news/112121-dan-tompkins-announced-tesseract-front-man.html |archive-date=27 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Acle had come into contact with Tompkins while assisting with the production of the album, ''Atlantic'' with his previous band, [[First Signs of Frost]]. The band reworked the album's songs with Tompkins, moving towards a 2010 release. Just before beginning their first major tour series, Tesseract released ''[[Concealing Fate]]'', a six-track suite that forms the centrepiece of their debut album, ''[[One (Tesseract album)|One]]'', which was released on 22 March 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centurymedia.com/release.aspx?IdRelease=801 |title=Century Media Records - TesseracT - Concealing Fate EP |publisher=Centurymedia.com |access-date=2014-07-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centurymedia.com/release.aspx?IdRelease=1198 |title=Century Media Records - TesseracT - One |publisher=Centurymedia.com |access-date=2014-07-12}}</ref> Later that year, Tesseract toured throughout the UK in support of ''One'' with openers [[Chimp Spanner]] and [[Uneven Structure]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.holdtightpr.com/news/article/tesseract-announce-uk-tour-with-chimp-spanner-and-uneven-structure |title=Tesseract announces UK tour |publisher=holdtightpr.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110202824/http://www.holdtightpr.com/news/article/tesseract-announce-uk-tour-with-chimp-spanner-and-uneven-structure |archive-date=10 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and also performed at the [[Sonisphere Festival]] in [[Knebworth]].

=== ''Perspective'' EP (2011–2012)===
On 20 August 2011, rumours began spreading that vocalist Daniel Tompkins had left the band, as Tesseract were seen performing with a different vocalist during a gig at the Craufurd Arms in [[Milton Keynes]]. This was confirmed by the band a few days later on 23 August, when they introduced Elliot Coleman as the band's new vocalist.<ref>{{cite web|last=Neilstein |first=Vince |url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2011/08/23/exclusive-interview-tesseracts-amos-williams-on-the-bands-recent-vocalist-swap/ |title=Exclusive Interview: Tesseract'S Amos Williams On The Band's Recent Vocalist Swap |date=23 August 2011 |publisher=MetalSucks |access-date=2014-07-12}}</ref> Daniel Tompkins went on to sing for the [[progressive metal]] band, [[Skyharbor]], the pop rock band, In Colour, and his experimental side project [[White Moth Black Butterfly]].

In September 2011, an instrumental version of ''One'' was digitally released and in October 2011, both the original and the instrumental versions were released on vinyl as a double LP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmdistro.de/Item/TesseracT_-_One_-black_2_LP/1009 |title=TesseracT - One /black 2 LP |publisher=Cmdistro.de |access-date=2014-07-12}}</ref>

During early 2012, Tesseract worked on an acoustic EP inspired by the radio acoustic session they played in Brooklyn, New York a year before. This came to be known as [[Perspective (EP)|''Perspective'']], which was released on 25 May 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centurymedia.com/release.aspx?IdRelease=1342 |title=Century Media Records - TesseracT - Perspective EP |publisher=Centurymedia.com |access-date=2014-07-12}}</ref>

=== ''Altered State'' (2012–2014)===
On 12 June 2012 Tesseract announced that Coleman had amicably left the band.<ref>{{cite web |author=Tesseract |url=http://tesseractband.co.uk/sad-news-2/ |title=Sad News… - TESSERACT |publisher=Tesseractband.co.uk |date=2013-01-18 |access-date=2014-07-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110212317/http://tesseractband.co.uk/sad-news-2/ |archive-date=10 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> On 7 September 2012 the band announced that they had found their yet-unnamed new vocalist and would release the single, "Nocturne", on 12 October.<ref>{{cite web| last = Kraus| first = Brian| title = Tesseract announce new single, find new singer| work = [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]| date = 9 September 2012| url = http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/tesseract_announce_new_single_find_new_singer| access-date = 9 September 2012}}</ref> A series of shows in Europe was also announced, including a performance at [[Euroblast Festival]].<ref>metalsucks.net: [http://www.metalsucks.net/2012/06/14/metalsucks-presents-euroblast-8-featuring-scar-symmetry-jeff-loomis-animals-as-leaders-and-more/ ''Metalsucks presents: Euroblast Volume 8, featuring Scar Symmetry, Jeff Loomis, Animals As Leaders and more''] Retrieved 26 June 2012</ref><ref>euroblast.net: [http://www.euroblast.net ''Euroblast Festival''] Retrieved 26 June 1012</ref> It was later revealed that the new singer was Ashe O'Hara of British progressive metal band [[Voices from the Fuselage]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Voicesfromthefuselage?fref=ts |title=Voices From The Fuselage |publisher=Facebook |access-date=2014-07-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltisTotmTQs |title=Voices From The Fuselage - The Wreckage (LYRIC VIDEO) |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-03-12 |access-date=2014-07-12}}</ref> Tesseract issued a short statement about the new vocalist on their website.<ref>{{cite web |author=Tesseract |url=http://tesseractband.co.uk/biography/ |title=Biography - TESSERACT |publisher=Tesseractband.co.uk |date=2013-01-18 |access-date=2014-07-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627152630/http://tesseractband.co.uk/biography/ |archive-date=27 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

On 28 February 2013 the band unveiled a release date for ''[[Altered State (Tesseract album)|Altered State]]'' alongside a full track listing of the album. The album is a 51-minute continuous piece divided into four large sections (''Of Matter'', ''Of Mind'', ''Of Reality'', ''Of Energy''), each of which contains several tracks. On 30 April "Singularity" was aired on BBC Radio 1's Rock show,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006wq4s |title=BBC Radio 1 - Rock Show with Daniel P Carter |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=1970-01-01 |access-date=2014-07-12}}</ref> and was later released on their [[SoundCloud]] account.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/centurymedia/singularity-radio-edit |title=TESSERACT - Singularity (Radio Edit) by Century Media Records on SoundCloud - Hear the world's sounds |publisher=Soundcloud.com |access-date=2014-07-12}}</ref>

During a phone interview with Metal Injection, Williams stated that the band would be going on tour in the United States during the summer of 2013 and touring Europe in late 2013.

''Altered State'' was streamed in its entirety on 12 May 2013 on [[Century Media]]'s official [[YouTube]] channel,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmR0gkojHDs |title=TESSERACT - Altered State (Full Album Stream) |publisher=YouTube |date=2013-05-12 |access-date=2014-07-12}}</ref> two weeks before its 27 May release.

=== ''Odyssey/Scala'' and ''Polaris'' (2014–2016)===
On 27 June 2014, it was announced that Ashe O'Hara had left the band and that Dan Tompkins would be rejoining, leaving [[Skyharbor]] in the process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=104003 |title=Tesseract Splits With Vocalist Yet Again - in Metal News |publisher=Metal Underground.com |access-date=2014-07-12}}</ref> On 18 May 2015, Tesseract released ''Odyssey/Scala'', their first live DVD and album compilation.

Shortly after Daniel Tompkins reunited with the band, writing and recording for a third studio album began. The band made frequent updates on social media depicting the members tracking multiple instruments in studio. On 10 July 2015 Tesseract's official Facebook page released a video teaser for the new album titled ''[[Polaris (Tesseract album)|Polaris]]''.  They also released album art and set a release date for 18 September 2015. A full album stream was uploaded to YouTube by [[Kscope|Kscope Music]] on 15 September 2015. In November 2015, the band toured in support of the new album with opening bands including [[The Contortionist]], [[Erra (band)|ERRA]] and [[Skyharbor]].

=== ''Sonder'' (2017–present) ===
Writing for ''[[Sonder (album)|Sonder]]'' was done throughout 2017. The band released the promo single, "Smile", on 23 June 2017. Several band members, including Acle Kahney and Amos Williams, acknowledged that the single was not a complete final mix and it would be further refined before its release on Sonder. According to Amos on Kscope's website, "We have a solid idea of where we would like to take this track on the next album, as it is in no way finished."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kscopemusic.com/2017/06/23/tesseract-release-smile-the-new-single-and-lyric-video/|title=Kscope &#124; TesseracT release "Smile" – the new single and lyric video|date=28 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628184556/http://www.kscopemusic.com/2017/06/23/tesseract-release-smile-the-new-single-and-lyric-video/|access-date=15 October 2020|archive-date=28 June 2017}}</ref> Tesseract's fourth studio album, ''Sonder'', was announced on 8 February 2018. The lead single, "Luminary", was also released on 8 February, and a second single, "King", was released on 16 March. The full album was released on 20 April 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bravewords.com/news/tesseract-to-release-sonder-album-in-april-luminary-single-streaming-tour-dates-announced|title=TESSERACT To Release Sonder Album In April; "Luminary" Single Streaming; Tour Dates Announced|publisher=[[Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles]]|access-date=February 8, 2018|date=February 8, 2018}}</ref>

Dan Tompkins began to pursue a solo career during this period, releasing his first solo album ''Castles'' in 2019 and his second ''Ruins'' in 2020. ''Castles'' has a dark pop/electronic rock sound, whilst ''Ruins'' is a progressive metal re-working of ''Castles'' with a brand new song "The Gift" (a collaboration between him and [[Matt Heafy]] of [[Trivium (band)|Trivium]]).

In 2020, Tesseract performed ''Portals'', described as a "live cinematic experience" as a ticketed online stream. Drummer Jay Postones was replaced by Mike Malyan (drummer of [[Monuments (metal band)|Monuments]]) for the event, since Postones chose to stay in Texas due to the necessary two-week isolation from the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Texas|COVID-19 pandemic]].

==Musical style==
Tesseract play a specific style of [[progressive metal]] that features open tunings on their guitars, [[polyrhythmic]] [[riff]]s, [[odd time signatures]] and several atmospheric layers. The band have stated that they do not compose their music with specific polyrhythms in mind, but play what they feel fits the groove. They also include a mid-range distorted guitar tone and melodic clean passages, heavily influenced by ambient music.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tesseract Unveil New Video|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/tesseract-unveil-new-video|work=[[Guitar World]]|publisher=[[Future US]]|access-date=17 October 2011|author=GuitarWorld Staff Member|date=16 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Rivadavia|first=Eduardo|title=One review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/one-r2139772/review|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=17 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Rivadavia|first=Eduardo|title=Concealing Fate review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/concealing-fate-r2166510|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=17 October 2011}}</ref> The band typically plays in the style of the subgenre [[djent]], pioneered by [[Meshuggah]] and [[SikTh]].

The vocal style of the band has seen a considerable shift. On ''One'', Daniel Tompkins employed a mixture of clean and harsh vocals, with an emphasis on long, drawn out notes. However, Ashe O'Hara's performances on ''Altered State'' contained no harsh vocals at all. In an interview with Metalspree, Ashe stated, "[R]ight now, being ourselves is to have purely melodic vocals. With 'One' they felt they had to have harsh vocals in order to be accepted by the community. But, they've never really wanted to be that type of band".<ref>[http://metalspreev2.com/2013/04/27/a-quick-chat-with-tesseracts-ashe-ohara/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804021727/http://metalspreev2.com/2013/04/27/a-quick-chat-with-tesseracts-ashe-ohara/|date=4 August 2013}}</ref> Harsh vocals returned to the band's sound following Dan Tompkins' return to the band, although they stuck to a mostly melodic and clean direction with the vocals on ''Polaris'' and ''Sonder''.

Throughout their career, the band have produced, mixed and mastered all of their material themselves. Williams is a qualified audio engineer and Acle Kahney has carried out production, mixing and mastering work for several other progressive metal bands under the name 4D Sounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4dsounds.com/showreel|title=4D SoundsShowreel|website=4D Sounds|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>

Amos Williams stated in an interview<ref>{{cite web|last=Myungnotta |first=John |url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2013/02/01/big-bottoms-amos-williams-from-tesseract/ |title=Big Bottoms: Amos Williams from TesseracT |date=February 2013 |publisher=MetalSucks |access-date=2014-07-12}}</ref> that Tesseract's music is relatively reliant on the bass in comparison to other metal bands: He states that "[The bass] is always on its own little shelf" in the music and that during the production process, "We left a lot of room for there to be sub and actual bass stuff going on".
