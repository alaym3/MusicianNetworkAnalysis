'''Gregory Broussard''' (born August 31, 1963), better known by his stage name '''Egyptian Lover''', is an American musician, vocalist, producer and DJ, and was a part of the L.A. [[dance music]] and rap scene in the early 1980s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/egyptian-lover-helped-invent-80s-electro-now-hes-bringing-it-back-6191431|title=Egyptian Lover Helped Invent '80s Electro — Now He's Bringing It Back|last=Ohanesian|first=Liz|date=2015-10-26|work=L.A.

== History ==
The Egyptian Lover was born in [[Los Angeles, California]], and started out there as a [[DJ]] with [[Uncle Jamm's Army]], DJing dances as large as the L.A. Sports Arena with 10,000 people.<ref name=noisey>Bell, Max. [https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/egyptian-lover-anthology-interview-2016 "A Freak Is a Freak, and Egyptian Lover Is an Icon"], ''Noisey'', 13 April 2016. Retrieved 2017-04-22.</ref> He began recording around Los Angeles in 1982 as a member of the Radio Crew, as well as Uncle Jamm's Army.

Most of the Egyptian Lover's successful recordings were 12" singles. He eventually released some of the earliest rap LPs, but they were less popular than his singles. On the strength of an alternate mix of his most popular single "Egypt, Egypt", 1984's ''On the Nile'' was moderately successful. After a break in the early 1990s, Egyptian Lover returned in 1994 with ''Back from the Tomb'', his first full-length album in over ten years.

The Egyptian Lover also established his own record company, Egyptian Empire Records, which included artists such as [[Rodney O & Joe Cooley]] [[2 Oclock]] & [[Te & Joezee]].

His 2015 release, ''1984'', continues his tradition of using all [[Analogue electronics|analog]] equipment, including the [[Roland TR-808]], along with much of the same gear used on his recordings of the 1980s. The name "1984" refers to his earlier albums. The album was recorded at Skip Saylor, Encore Studios, and at RUSK Studios, the same studio where ''On The Nile'' was recorded in 1984. It is widely available on double gatefold LP, CD and cassette tape.
