Allegedly, the FBI attempted to enter the club in which Kodak Black was performing, but denied entry by the owner. [[TMZ]] stated it was "unclear" whether or not the bus was actually owned by Kodak Black. This came a week after his arrest at the U.S.-Canada border. It was stated Kodak Black himself did not get in trouble with law enforcement.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shifferaw |first1=Abel |title=FBI Raided Kodak Black's Tour Buses While Rapper Was Performing in Washington D.C. |url=https://www.complex.com/music/2019/04/kodak-black-tour-bus-reportedly-raided-by-cops-fbi-in-washington-dc |website=complex.com |publisher=Complex |access-date=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Centeno |first1=Tony |title=BUS OUTSIDE KODAK BLACK SHOW RAIDED BY FBI: REPORT |url=https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/04/kodak-black-fbi-raid/ |website=xxxlmag.com |publisher=XXL Magazine |access-date=April 25, 2019}}</ref>

On May 11, 2019, while preparing to perform at Rolling Loud Miami, Kodak Black was arrested on firearm charges before he could perform. He was arrested by Miami PD and Federal Officers, and is facing state and federal charges. This was nearly a month after he was arrested while entering the United States from Canada.<ref>{{cite web |last1=P. |first1=Milca |title=Kodak Black Reportedly Arrested At Rolling Loud Miami On Firearms Charges |url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/kodak-black-reportedly-arrested-at-rolling-loud-miami-on-firearms-charges-news.79899.html |website=hotnewhiphop |date=May 12, 2019 |publisher=hotnewhiphop |access-date=May 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Rapper Kodak Black arrested in Miami on weapons charges |url=https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article230309874.html |website=miamiherald.com |publisher=Miami Herald |access-date=May 12, 2019}}</ref> Kodak Black was charged with two counts of making a false statement on a governmental form, this apparently stems from January 2019, when he lied on a form while attempting to purchase firearms. He filed to use his $600,000 home as collateral for his $500,000 bond for the indictments and was granted the bond, being released. He reportedly faces up to 10 years in prison on the charges, and plead not guilty on May 15. Federal prosecutors, however, are attempting to revoke Kodak Black's bail, pointing to past violent crimes, such as a 2012 carjacking incident, and his possible connections to a shooting in March. The new arrest may also cause his bond in the 2016 South Carolina rape case to be revoked. Federal prosecutors stated that he is a danger to society due to his long history of criminal acts as well as his repeated violation of past probation rules. Kodak Black's lawyer stated that he voluntarily turned himself in upon hearing of a warrant, and is not a danger to society due to the crime being non-violent.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rapper Kodak Black pleads not guilty to weapons charges |url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rapper-kodak-black-not-guilty-weapons-charges |website=foxnews.com |date=May 16, 2019 |publisher=Fox News |access-date=May 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Muhammad |first1=Latifah |title=Federal Prosecutors Reportedly Claim Kodak Black Is A Danger To Society |url=https://www.vibe.com/2019/05/prosecutors-kodak-black-danger-to-society |website=vibe.com |date=May 18, 2019 |publisher=Vibe |access-date=May 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Fitzgerald |first1=Trent |title=FEDERAL PROSECUTORS SAY KODAK BLACK NEEDS TO STAY IN JAIL: REPORT |url=https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/05/prosecutors-kodak-black-jail/ |website=xxlmag.com |publisher=XXL Magazine |access-date=May 18, 2019}}</ref> It was reported by [[TMZ]] on November 13, 2019, that Kodak Black had taken a [[plea bargain]] and had been sentenced to 46 months in prison, a drastically shorter sentence than the 96 months that the courts had been considering as the rapper had been involved in a fight while incarcerated that involved injury to a prison guard.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/13/kodak-black-sentenced-46-months-prison-federal-gun-case/|title=Kodak Black Gets Nearly 4 Years in Prison in Federal Gun Case|website=TMZ|language=en|access-date=November 13, 2019}}</ref>
