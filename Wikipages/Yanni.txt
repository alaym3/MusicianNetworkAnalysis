==Early life==
Yanni was born November 14, 1954, in [[Kalamata]], Greece,<ref name="AllMusicBio"/> the son of a banker, Sotiri Chryssomallis,<ref name=Winters2004/> and a homemaker, Felitsa (short for Triandafelitsa, which means "rose"<ref name=AutobiographyP13/>). He displayed musical talent at a young age, playing the piano at the age of 6.<ref name="AllMusicBio"/> His parents encouraged him to learn at his own pace and in his own way, without formal music training.<ref name="AllMusicBio"/> The self-taught musician continues to use the "musical shorthand" that he developed as a child, rather than employ traditional [[musical notation]].<ref name="VOAnews20030615"/><ref name="HellenismYanniBio"/>

Yanni set a Greek national record in the 50-meter freestyle swimming competition at age 14.<ref name="VOAnews20120123"/><ref name="FtWayne20040311"/>

In November 1972, Yanni moved from Greece to the United States to attend the [[University of Minnesota]] beginning in January 1973, majoring in psychology.<ref name="AllMusicBio"/> For a time he earned money by washing dishes at the student union.<ref name="UMinnSpeech20040506"/> Yanni later explained that learning English forced him to read each paragraph several times in what he called a slow and frustrating process, but which helped him memorize the material and do well on tests.<ref name="UMinnSpeech20040506"/> He received a B.A. degree in psychology in 1976.<ref name="VOAnews20120123"/>

During his time as a student, Yanni played in a local rock band and continued to study piano and other keyboard instruments.<ref name="AllMusicBio"/> Upon graduating, when he dedicated himself exclusively to music for one full year and found he was the happiest he had ever been, he said he decided music would be his life's work.<ref name="UMinnSpeech20040506"/>

==Music career==
In 1977, Yanni joined the Minneapolis-based rock group [[Chameleon (American band)|Chameleon]], performing with its founder, drummer [[Charlie Adams (drummer)|Charlie Adams]],<ref name="AllMusicBio"/><ref name=DemingBillboardBio/> with whom he would work into the 2010s.<ref name=NWItimes20160128/> While in Minneapolis, Yanni also worked with choreographer [[Loyce Houlton]] to provide music for dance works produced by the [[Minnesota Dance Theatre]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} After touring with Chameleon from 1980 to 1984,<ref name=NWItimes20160128/> Yanni moved to Los Angeles in pursuit of movie soundtrack work.<ref name="VOAnews20120123"/><ref name="LehighMorningCall20120622"/>

===1980s to early 1990s: Emergence and recognition===
In 1980, Yanni recorded his first album ''[[Optimystique]],'' which [[Atlantic Records]] re-released in 1984 and [[Private Music]] re-released in 1989.<ref name="AllMusicBio"/><ref name="LATimes19930613"/>

Yanni formed a band in 1987 and began to tour in 1988 with an ensemble including pianist/singer [[John Tesh]] and drummer [[Charlie Adams (drummer)|Charlie Adams]], promoting his early albums ''[[Keys to Imagination]],'' ''[[Out of Silence (Yanni album)|Out of Silence]],'' and ''[[Chameleon Days]]''.<ref name="VOAnews20120123"/><ref name="LATimes19930613"/> A highlight of the tour was a performance with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra that elicited a positive review, considered seminal to Yanni's public recognition, from a ''[[Dallas Times Herald]]'' critic.<ref name="LATimes19930613"/> Yanni's emergence was said to be "timed perfectly" with the growing popularity of contemporary instrumental music.<ref name="LATimes19930613"/> In this time frame, Yanni wrote motion picture soundtracks for ''[[Steal the Sky]]'' (1988), ''[[Heart of Midnight (film)|Heart of Midnight]]'' (1988), ''I Love You Perfect'' (1989), ''[[She'll Take Romance]]'' (1990), ''[[When You Remember Me]]'' (1990), ''[[Children of the Bride]]'' (1990), and ''Hua qi Shao Lin'' (1994).<ref name=GreekRUbio/>

Yanni gained visibility as the result of his November 1990 appearances in ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine<ref name="EntWeekly19910118"/><ref name="People19901126"/> and on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' with actress [[Linda Evans]],<ref name="LATimes20001024"/><ref name="EntWeekly19910118"/> with whom he had been in a relationship since 1989.<ref name="LATimes19930613"/><ref name="LATimes19950527"/> However, high-visibility appearances on public television, best-selling records and videos, and overflow concerts earned him recognition beyond his relationship with Evans.<ref name="LATimes19950527"/>

''[[Dare to Dream (Yanni album)|Dare to Dream]],'' released in 1992, was Yanni's first [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-nominated<ref name="VOAnews20120123"/> album. It included "Aria," a song based on Léo Delibes' [[The Flower Duet]] (''Lakmé,'' 1883) and popularized by an award-winning<ref name="LATimes19930613"/> [[British Airways]] [[British Airways face advertisement|commercial]]. A second Grammy-nominated<ref name="VOAnews20120123"/> album, ''[[In My Time]],'' followed in 1993.

Yanni's breakthrough<ref name="ChicagoTrib19980215"/><ref name="VOAnews20030615"/> concert, ''[[Live at the Acropolis]],'' was filmed in September 1993 at the 2,000-year-old [[Odeon of Herodes Atticus|Herodes Atticus Theater]] at the [[Acropolis of Athens]], an album, [[VHS]] and [[Laserdisc]] being released in 1994.<ref name="VOAnews20120123"/> ''Acropolis'' was Yanni's first live album, and used his core band with a full sixty piece orchestra,<ref name="VOAnews20120123"/> the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] which was arranged and conducted by Iranian-American musician [[Shahrdad Rohani]].<ref name="AllmusicAcropolis"/><ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title = Making it in America: A Sourcebook on Eminent Ethnic Americans|last = Dallafar|first = Arlene|publisher = ABC - CLIO|year = 2001|isbn = 9781576070987|location = Santa Barbara, California|pages = [https://archive.org/details/makingitinameric00bark/page/320 320]|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/makingitinameric00bark/page/320}}</ref>

Without financial backing, Yanni risked $2 million of his personal fortune in the ''Acropolis'' production<ref name="ChicagoTrib19980215"/> in a strategy to boost his artistic profile and open new markets for his music.<ref name="VOAnews20030615"/> The resulting video was broadcast on [[PBS]] and became one of its most popular programs ever, seen in 65 countries by half a billion people.<ref name="VOAnews20120123"/><ref name="9news20120521"/> It became the second best-selling music concert video of all time (after ''[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Michael Jackson's Thriller]]''<ref name="TheNationThailand20111013"/>), selling more than 7 million copies worldwide.<ref name="MontrealGazette20120614"/><ref name="VOAnews20120123"/>

In March 1997, Yanni became one of the few Western artists permitted to perform and record at the [[Taj Mahal]] in India.<ref name="LATimes19970530"/> Yanni followed in May 1997 with performances at the [[Forbidden City]] in Beijing, China, becoming the first Western artist in modern times permitted to perform at the historic site.<ref name="LATimes19970530"/> Live broadcasts of the two concerts were seen by 100 million television viewers throughout the world.<ref name=WashPost_19980130/> The two events formed the live album and video, ''[[Tribute (Yanni album)|Tribute]],'' released in November 1997.<ref name="LATimes19970530"/>

After negotiating the demands of gaining permission to perform at the Taj Mahal and Forbidden City in 1997, breaking up with Linda Evans in early 1998, and completing a long world tour later in 1998, Yanni halted his music career.<ref name="LATimes20001024"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ryan|first1=Joal|title=Soul Mates Yanni and Linda Evans Uncouple|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/35853/soul-mates-yanni-and-linda-evans-uncouple|website=Eonline.com|access-date=August 21, 2014}}</ref> Yanni later related that he had become depressed, and returned to Greece to live with his parents for three months before traveling the world.<ref name="LATimes20001024"/> He didn't do an interview for two years, later explaining, "I traveled. I wanted to see other people's ideas of life, get out of the American dream."<ref name="LATimes20001024"/>

===2000s to 2010: After a hiatus, new perspectives===
In 2000, after the two-year hiatus, Yanni released ''[[If I Could Tell You]],'' his first studio album in seven years. The album sold 55,000 copies in its first week and landed at No. 20 on the ''Billboard'' charts, his highest debut to date.<ref name="LATimes20001024"/> Yanni described the album as more of an even-tempered "listening" album, less dramatic than the live concert albums ''Live at the Acropolis'' or ''Tribute.''<ref name="BandNinterview2000"/> He explained that he himself created all the album's sounds, including apparent vocalizations, through the manipulation of sound in his studio.<ref name="BandNinterview2000"/>

The music in Yanni's 2003 album ''[[Ethnicity (album)|Ethnicity]]'' represented many of the world's cultures, Yanni saying it uses [[wikt:ethnicity|ethnicity]] to reflect the color and beauty of a multicultural society.<ref name="Terra20070404"/> The album was released near the publication date of Yanni's autobiography, ''Yanni in Words.''<ref name="Terra20070404"/> On October 23, 2003, Yanni performed a keyboard instrumental version of ''[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]'' before Game 5 of the [[2003 World Series]].<ref name="Gleeman20031024"/>

The ''[[Truth of Touch]]'' album was released in February 2011, Yanni's first studio album of new material since ''Ethnicity'' eight years earlier.<ref name="VOAnews20120123"/> ''Truth of Touch's'' varied content reflected contemporary instrumental, electronic, and cinematic influences, and crossed over into popular, new age, and world music.<ref name="NewAgeMusicWorld20110124"/> Though Yanni said that ''Truth of Touch'' was started by experimenting with new sound designs,<ref name="MontrealGazette20120614"/> [[Allmusic]]'s James Christopher Monger said that the album shows Yanni returning to his instrumental roots, and should appeal to fans of his music from the mid-1990s.<ref name="AllmusicTruthOfTouch"/> Three of fifteen tracks on the predominantly instrumental album included vocals from respective ''Yanni Voices'' vocalists.<ref name="AllmusicTruthOfTouch"/>

In April 2012, Yanni released the ''[[Live at El Morro, Puerto Rico]]'' live album CD and DVD which were recorded and filmed at two outdoor concerts on December 16 and 17, 2011 on the grounds of the [[Castillo San Felipe del Morro|Castillo (Fort) San Felipe del Morro]] ("El Morro"), a UNESCO World Heritage Site in San Juan, Puerto Rico.<ref name="KPBS20120604"/> The recorded concerts were broadcast on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] beginning in March 2012, the production constituting Yanni's tenth collaboration with that organization.<ref name="KPBS20120604"/>

Yanni's 2010s tours included new vocalists, distinct from the 2008–2009 ''Yanni Voices'' vocalists, though the setlists remained predominantly instrumental.<ref name="CorreioBrazil20100923"/>

In March 2014, Yanni released his seventeenth studio album, ''[[Inspirato]],'' a collaboration with operatic tenor [[Plácido Domingo]] and producer [[Ric Wake]] that, like ''[[Yanni Voices]]'' five years earlier, highlighted vocal performances.<ref name=AllmusicInspirato/> In ''[[Inspirato]],'' distinguished operatic vocalists performed remakes of songs that Yanni had previously released over his career, the songs' titles and lyrics being predominantly in the Italian language.<ref name=AllmusicInspirato/>

In March 2015, Yanni released the title soundtrack for a Chinese documentary movie ''Hexi Corridor''.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

On October 30 and 31, 2015, Yanni performed two concerts on the grounds of the [[Egyptian pyramids]] and [[Great Sphinx of Giza]], his first performance in Egypt.<ref name=AlBawaba20151101/> The concerts included fireworks and a video broadcast from [[International Space Station]] commander [[Scott Kelly (astronaut)|Scott Kelly]],<ref name=AlBawaba20151101/><ref name=InverseAlBawaba20151103/> and were recorded in [[4K resolution|4K HD]] for subsequent broadcast on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]].<ref name=BroadwayWorld20151105/> To convey an image of stable security after the [[Egyptian Crisis (2011–14)]], an Egyptian security force of 3,000 people secured the concert area.<ref name=CairoPost20151022/>

In December 2015, Yanni produced a song, "Seven Billion Dreams," for a [[NASA]] video that marked the 15th anniversary of the [[International Space Station]].<ref name=WSJ20151227/>

Yanni's single, "When Dreams Come True", called a "minimal piano-led" piece, was composed incrementally throughout a 60-date North American tour as a series of improvisations performed during successive shows.<ref name=TheNationalAE20190226/> Its first complete live performance was in February 2019 at the [[Winter at Tantora Festival]] in [[Al-'Ula]], Saudi Arabia, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.<ref name=ArabNews_20190209/>

==Influences, music and concerts==
===Musical Influences===
From childhood, Yanni accepted a wide variety of musical styles, listening to radio stations from Northern Africa, Arab countries, and Europe.<ref name="LATimes19881202"/> He observed that "there were no ''rock'' stations or ''classical'' stations—[[full service (radio format)|each station would just play everything]]."<ref name="LATimes19881202"/> Yanni's music is said to reflect his encounters with cultures around the world<ref name="SavannahNow20120526"/><ref name="ChanVillager20120428"/> and embody his philosophy of "one world, one people."<ref name="SavannahNow20120526"/> In this vein, ''[[Booth Newspapers]]' '' Jeffrey Kaczmarczyk perceived the eclectic inspirations of Yanni's music to be an element of his success: Yanni's "Middle Eastern and Oriental scales and mixed meters sound just exotic enough to entice his middle-of-the-road fans, but not so authentic as to mystify folks who grew up with a backbeat, so you can't lose it," adding that certain songs "leave you with a sense that you've just heard a bit of a steel drum or a Greek bouzouki or a Japanese koto or possibly all three."<ref name="mLive20120508"/>

}}
Yanni's musical influences include music from Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East, as well as classical, rock and roll, and electronic music.<ref name="MontrealGazette20120614"/> Yanni explained that the 1970s, with its new technology and electronic instruments, were particularly influential at that stage in his career, and that even recently his ''Truth of Touch'' album (2011) was started by experimenting with new sound designs.<ref name="MontrealGazette20120614"/> Having been exposed to classical music very early in life—listening to Bach at age 8<ref name="LehighMorningCall20120622"/>—he counts several classical pianists and composers among his influences, citing [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] as a favorite<ref name="AugustaChron20120522"/> and [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]] as "No. 2 favorite."<ref name="LehighMorningCall20120622"/> Yanni mentioned being influenced not only by classical composers like [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], but also rock and roll bands such as [[Led Zeppelin]], the [[People!]], and [[Black Sabbath]].<ref name="LehighMorningCall20120622"/>

Yanni explained that "the most influence I've ever had from music was doing (soundtracks for) movies{{nbsp}}... mostly instrumental music," mentioning his love for the work of [[Jerry Goldsmith]] and [[John Williams]].<ref name="LehighMorningCall20120622"/> ''[[The Augusta Chronicle]]'s'' Kelly Jasper noted that most of Yanni's music is instrumental, indicating that Yanni surmised that the lack of lyrics is what allowed his music to become popular internationally.<ref name="AugustaChron20120522"/> Yanni went on to say, "There are no lyrics in my music for the most part, so the whole message is transmitted through the rhythm, melody, and sounds, and I think that has to do with crossing all the borders and being able to go to different countries."<ref name="AugustaChron20120522"/> "It is very difficult, if not impossible, to [[lie]] with instrumental music because it deals in emotions only."<ref name="BandNinterview2000"/> He has also said that words operate in a different area of the brain,<ref name="HellenismYanniBio"/> and lyrics "tend to put a song into a box."<ref name="TheNationThailand20111013"/>

However, Yanni performed with four vocalists in the forefront in ''[[Yanni Voices]]'' (2008–2009),<ref name="Billboard/Disney20081114"/> and performed with vocalists on tours and in the ''[[Live at El Morro, Puerto Rico]]'' concerts (December 2011) and CD/DVD (2012).<ref name="CorreioBrazil20100923"/> In late 2011 Yanni remarked that he tends to prefer instrumental music "because it's more open, but the human voice too can be the most expressive instrument known to man. There is power to it."<ref name="TheNationThailand20111013"/> Referring to his creative experiences on the 2009 ''Voices'' project, Yanni explained that "while most of the music I write is instrumental, I love to use the human voice as another instrument."<ref name="ArizonaRepublic20110711"/>

While Yanni has said that new age is "a spiritual definition more than a musical definition,"<ref name="Courant19920426"/> his music is said to be "adopted by"<ref name="CourierJournal20120426"/><ref name="MontrealGazette20120614"/> the [[New Age|New Age movement]] as it gained mainstream momentum. His music is also called ''contemporary instrumental''<ref name="CourierJournal20120426"/> and has been described as "an instrumental blend of fusion-jazz, world music, classical, and soft rock."<ref name="ChicagoTrib19980215"/> However, at least as early as 1988, Yanni was said to shun labels such as "Greek" and "new age," emphasizing that "when someone says new age music, I think of something that you put on in the background while you're vacuuming the house. I don't want to relax the audience; I want to engage them in the music, get them interested."<ref name="LATimes19881202"/> Distinguishing his work from what others have called ambient mood music, Yanni pointed out in 1994: ''"New age'' implies a more subdued, more relaxed music than what I do. My music can be very rhythmic, very energetic, even very ethnic."<ref name="LATimes19940227"/>

In 2012, Yanni remarked that he has never liked putting art into categories or assigning labels, adding that he always composed music "to honestly reflect the lessons learned and the experiences I have shared throughout my life."<ref name="MontrealGazette20120614"/> For example, Yanni's university study of [[psychology]] influenced his music: "When I create music, it is a reflection of my soul, my experiences in life and my relationships with other people and cultures. Psychology, and understanding who we are as people in this world, is present in almost every creative thought I have."<ref name="MontrealGazette20120614"/>

===Unconventional career track===
The genre of Yanni's music made it unsuitable for most commercial radio or for [[MTV|music television]].<ref name="Courant19920426"/><ref name="LATimes20001024"/> In 2012 Yanni expressed the importance of [[PBS]] to his career, saying that the network "always allowed me to present my music without any censorship or influence, and encouraged me to be the artist that I am," and had been "a great part of my career for over 20 years."<ref name="Musicilluminati20120716"/>

Yanni took an unconventional path to recognition, for example, by risking his personal fortune to fund historic-monument events such as his 1993 Acropolis concerts, by producing specials on public television, by creating alone in his home-built studio, and by performing many of his own production duties—thus by-passing the conventional music industry.<ref name="LATimes20001024"/> In 2000, ''The [[Washington Post]]'s'' David Segal wrote that Yanni was "a living metaphor for 'success on your own terms,' the dream of every American with an idea that is either ridiculed or ignored."<ref name="LATimes20001024"/>

===Music===
In an early-career review in the ''[[Dallas Times Herald]]'' in the late 1980s, Yanni's concert with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra was described as "exhilarating, moving and inspiring."<ref name="LATimes19930613"/> In 1995, ''The [[Los Angeles Times]]' '' Don Heckman wrote that Yanni's music is "based on sweeping romantic melodies underscored with energetic Mediterranean rhythms."<ref name="LATimes19950527"/> More analytically, the ''[[Hartford Courant]]'s'' Steve Metcalf "deconstructed" Yanni's music as being "from a harmonic standpoint, constructed of materials found in a lot of late-19th, early 20th century classical music. It is essentially tonal, tinged with mild whiffs of dissonance here and there, sometimes rhythmically frisky, graspable on first listening, and self-evidently mood-inducing. There are two basic moods to Yanni music: struttingly heroic with martial overtones, and dreamily contemplative{{nbsp}}... A kind of peaceful, easy-feeling link between pop music and classical music."<ref name="HartfordCourant19950625"/>

More recently, [[Allmusic]]'s Mark Deming characterized Yanni's compositions and performances as having "a pronounced sense of drama, dynamics, and romanticism," writing that Yanni has a "commanding performance style."<ref name="AllMusicBio"/> Rob Garratt wrote in ''The National'' that Yanni "breaks all the rules" in producing music "typically in two modes – poundingly heroic or reflectively ambient."<ref name=National20160926/> In 2012 Howie Grapek remarked in ''[[The Palm Beach Post]]'s'' ''PBPulse'' that "there are few modern-day composers with a unique sense of music and style which is truly their own. To compare new-age music with classic rock is a stretch, but for Yanni, it is possible. This Greek composer marries contemporary new-age spirituality with today's pop attitudes and delivers a unique sound."<ref name="PalmBeachPulse20120418"/> Yanni popularized the combination of electronic music synthesizers with a full scale symphony orchestra.<ref name=DNAindia20150122/>

Having been called a "true global artist,"<ref name=DNAindia20150122/> Yanni has employed musicians of various nationalities, and has incorporated a variety of exotic instruments from around the world from an Australian didgeridoo to a Peruvian charango, to perform with his classical orchestra, rock rhythm section, and electronic keyboards.<ref name="ChicagoTrib19980215"/> His music is described as "an eclectic fusion of ethnic sounds, from Native American chants to African rhythms and Asian harmonies."<ref name="VOAnews20030615"/> Before his 2015 concerts at the Egyptian Pyramids Yanni said that emotions are the same throughout the world, and that his predominantly instrumental music can communicate those emotions with people everywhere because it bypasses language.<ref name=AlBawaba20151029/>

''[[The Morning Call]]'s'' John L. Moser wrote that "trends come and trends go," but that Yanni's music "seems to defy trends and{{nbsp}}... feels like it's music for all time."<ref name="LehighMorningCall20120622"/> Moser interviewed the composer, asking if he intentionally tries to create "something that's going to last forever as opposed to something that's just going to sell 1 million copies right away," Yanni replied that "There's no way you can create art to last forever{{nbsp}}... so you can't have that in your mind."<ref name="LehighMorningCall20120622"/> Instead, describing his creative process, Yanni explained that his knowledge of music and instruments and his experience in different cultures is a "primordial soup that comes together and it shows itself and it appears. And it's fluid. It's effortless."<ref name="LehighMorningCall20120622"/>

Yanni's popularity with the public and his success on public television have contrasted sharply with views of some critics.<ref name="HartfordCourant19950625"/><ref name=TheNationalAE20190226/> The more extreme criticisms include statements that Yanni's music is "aural wallpaper{{nbsp}}... lacking in substance"<ref name=TheNationalAE20190226/> or characterizing Yanni as a "no-talent poseur" whose music has little intellectual weight,<ref name="HartfordCourant19950625"/> while his fans' opinions have been paraphrased as calling Yanni a "highly original artist whose profound spirituality has created a unique kind of music."<ref name="HartfordCourant19950625"/> In this regard, one commentator wrote in 2019 that Yanni's songs are "hazy and undefinable" and "unstructured in the traditional way", paraphrasing Yanni's statement that listeners' responses depend on the degree to which they "invest themselves in the music", which has a "relentless focus on feeling rather than [[Hook (music)|hooks]]".<ref name=TheNationalAE20190226/>

Yanni claims to have had [[absolute pitch|perfect pitch]] since childhood.<ref name="AugustaChron20120522"/><ref name="SavannahNow20120526"/> He continues to use the "musical shorthand" that he developed as a child rather than employ traditional [[musical notation]],<ref name="VOAnews20030615"/><ref name="HellenismYanniBio"/> and hires someone to perform the tedious process of making conventional written charts for orchestra members.<ref name="BandNinterview2000"/> Even so, since music is an auditory domain, Yanni must train the musicians in what cannot be conveyed in that writing.<ref name="BandNinterview2000"/>

===Concerts and live streaming===
''[[The Palm Beach Post]]'s'' Howie Grapek remarked about an April 2012 performance that the show was not a one-man keyboard show, but spotlighted individual long solos showcasing the band members' talents, and that Yanni "loves giving them the opportunity to shine individually."<ref name="PalmBeachPulse20120418"/> ''[[Booth Newspapers]]' '' Jeffrey Kaczmarczyk commented that Yanni "has great sidemen – always has."<ref name="mLive20120508"/> Further, Yanni expands sound variety by using multiple interchangeable keyboards that are interconnected so that playing one keyboard can cause other keyboards to play corresponding notes emulating different instruments.<ref name=MasterClass20160729/>

Yanni's concerts, known for their lighting and other technical aspects,<ref name="QuadCityTimes20120503"/> require over 2,000 timing cues for a show's lighting.<ref name=Harman20160731/> Yanni's longtime [[lighting designer]] remarked in 2013 that the lighting is critically timed to Yanni's music itself, accommodating its variety of [[time signature]]s, further observing that since Yanni plays mostly theatrical venues rather than arenas, the lighting can include subtle moves and color.<ref name="ProjectionLightsStaging201302"/> The lighting also emphasizes band members' solos, as well as specific moments in the concerts.<ref name="ProjectionLightsStaging201302"/>

Commenting on Yanni's "great lighting" on the stage and "plenty of reverb in the audience," ''[[Booth Newspapers]]' '' Jeffrey Kaczmarczyk remarked that a Yanni concert "can be an intoxicating experience."<ref name=mLive20120508/>

In early 2017 Yanni began his "An Evening in Conversation with Yanni"<ref name=BroadwayWorld20170207/> or "An intimate Conversation with Yanni"<ref name=patch20171030/> tour in which audience questions and on-stage participation guided the show, and Yanni played a piano without a band.<ref name=BroadwayWorld20170207/><ref name=patch20171030/> In May-June 2019, Yanni performed a multi-night residency at New York’s [[Lunt-Fontanne Theatre]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Pure Yanni in Residence on Broadway / Lunt-Fontanne Theatre |url=https://www.newyorktheatreguide.com/show/pure-yanni-in-residence-on-broadway|website=newyorktheatreguide.com |publisher=New York Theater Guide |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713170008/https://www.newyorktheatreguide.com/show/pure-yanni-in-residence-on-broadway |archive-date=July 13, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> two videos for which topped ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]]'' Top [[List of Facebook features#Live streaming|Facebook Live]] Videos chart<ref name=Billboard_20190718/> before other Yanni videos topped the same chart in October<ref name=Billboard_20191120/> December 2019,<ref name=Billboard_20200117/> and February 2020.<ref name=Billboard_20200320/>

Rising in popularity with the new age music boom of the 1980s and 1990s, Yanni's music became more well known through adult alternative radio airplay, appearances on public television and in television commercials, as well as international music tours.<ref name="AllMusicBio"/> Yanni's music has been used in television shows and televised sporting events, including the [[The Open Championship|British Open (golf)]],<ref name=Golfweek_20190625/> the [[U.S. Open (golf)]],<ref name=CBSsports_20200917/> the Super Bowl, ''Wide World of Sports'', U.S. Open tennis championships,  the Tour de France, the World Figure Skating Championships and the Olympic Games.<ref name="VOAnews20120123"/><ref name="LATimes19930613"/><ref name=GolfDigest20140612/> He also composed music for ABC's ''World News Now.''<ref name="Courant19920426"/>

}}
Yanni's "Acroyali/Standing in Motion" was determined to have the "[[Mozart effect]]" by the ''[[Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]]'' (April 2001) because the composition is similar to [[Sonata for Two Pianos in D major (Mozart)|Mozart's K 448]] in tempo, structure, melodic and harmonic consonance and predictability, characteristics thought to decrease seizure activity and to enhance spatial-temporal performance.<ref name="EpilepsyOrgMozartEffect"/>

During Yanni's October 2011 tour of China, Yanni became the first [[Western world|Western]] artist to be invited to adopt a [[giant panda]] (bear) cub at the [[Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding]], a "privilege{{nbsp}}... usually reserved for countries rather than [[celebrity|personalities]]."<ref name="reuters20111012"/> "Officials from the research base invited the musician to adopt the animal, saying their decision was made from the inspiration and harmony that derives from his music."<ref name="skynews20111012"/> Yanni named the panda "Santorini," also the name of a [[Santorini|Greek island]], explaining that the Greek word ''irini'' means 'peace'."<ref name="reuters20111012"/><ref name="skynews20111012"/>

In February 2013, Yanni and [[Celine Dion]] were the first non-Chinese artists invited to perform (separately) in China at the [[CCTV New Year's Gala|CCTV Spring Festival Gala]], a [[China Central Television|CCTV]] televised event with an annual audience of 700 million.<ref name="WantChinaTimes20130201"/><ref name="ChinaDaily20130208"/><ref name="CNTV20130209"/>

Yanni's albums ''[[Dare to Dream (Yanni album)|Dare to Dream]]'' (1992) and ''[[In My Time]]'' (1993) received [[Grammy Award]] nominations for [[Grammy Award for Best New Age Album|Best New Age Album]]."<ref name="VOAnews20120123"/>

The PBS specials ''Live at the Acropolis'' and ''Tribute'' received [[Emmy Award]] nominations for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Lighting Direction (Electronic) for a Drama Series, Variety Series, Miniseries, Movie or Special, in 1994<ref name="EmmyLighting1994"/> and 1998,<ref name="EmmyLighting1998"/> respectively.

At least sixteen Yanni albums peaked at No. 1 in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' "Top New Age Album" category, more than anyone except Jim Brickman and Mannheim Steamroller.<ref name=Billboard20160212/>

In addition to earning a B.A. in psychology in 1976 from the [[University of Minnesota|University of Minnesota, Twin Cities]],<ref name="VOAnews20120123"/> Yanni received an honorary [[Doctor of Humane Letters]] from the same institution on May 6, 2004.<ref name="ChanVillager20120428"/><ref name="UMinnSpeech20040506"/><ref name="StPaulPioneer20040508"/>
