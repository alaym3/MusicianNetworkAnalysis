==Early years==
Sampha was born in [[Morden]], [[South London]] to Sierra Leonean parents who came to the United Kingdom in the 1980s. His introduction to music came from learning to play on the piano at his parents' home in [[Morden]] and absorbing records given to him by his older siblings. Later, he discovered music production as a young teen, after his older brother, Sanie, built himself a makeshift home studio. He also went to [[Ewell Castle School]] for a number of years where he studied [[GCE Advanced Level|A-Level]] Music and in 2017 returned to open a new music building.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/15691229.mercury-prize-winner-sampha-sisay-returns-to-ewell-castle-school/|title=Mercury Prize-winner Sampha Sisay returns to Ewell Castle School|website=Your Local Guardian|language=en|access-date=2019-06-24}}</ref> Subsequently, in 2007, through [[Myspace]].com, Sampha met London producer, [[Kwes]], whose music Sampha said changed his life. Kwes guided and introduced Sampha to musicians, [[Mica Levi|Mica "Micachu" Levi]], [[Ghostpoet]], [[Dels (musician)|DELS]] and his now label-home, [[Young (record label)|Young]] in 2009, where he interned.<ref name="YTCPMercury2017">{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BZEhJOoFtAK/|title=Instagram post by Young Turks • Sep 15, 2017 at 5:47pm UTC|website=Instagram|access-date=17 December 2017}}</ref> Through Young, Sampha remixed '[[Basic Space]]' by [[The xx]] and met his earliest collaborators: [[SBTRKT]], [[Jessie Ware]], Bullion and [[Lil Silva]].
