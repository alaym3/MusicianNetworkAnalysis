== History ==

=== Formation and indie label releases (2008–2014) ===
Badflower's earliest incarnation, the Cartunes, formed in 2008, when music school students, Northridge CA born Josh Katz, and Gilroy CA transplant, Joey Morrow, met at their Hollywood CA apartment building. The pair moved in together, and began writing songs for their 5 piece band. They released a self produced EP in 2011 but after losing their bass player and rhythm guitarist, reformed as rock band Badflower, recruiting Espiritu and Sonetti to round out their ranks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/badflower-interview-ghost/|title=Badflower's Josh Katz Looks Into the Darkness on 'Ghost'|last=Sharp|first=Tyler|website=Loudwire|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bandwagmag.com/2016/12/badflower-behaving-like-animals/|title=Badflower: Behaving Like Animals - BandWagon Magazine|date=2016-12-05|newspaper=BandWagon Magazine|access-date=2016-12-23}}</ref> They played several shows in [[Los Angeles]] including a weekly residency at The Key Club<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://themusies.com/2016/12/the-musies-sit-down-with-republic-records-badflower/|title=The Musies Sit Down With Republic Records' Badflower|date=2016-12-12|website=The Musies|access-date=2016-12-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223203929/http://themusies.com/2016/12/the-musies-sit-down-with-republic-records-badflower/|archive-date=2016-12-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> and gained attention from [[satellite radio]] personality and former [[NSYNC]] member [[Lance Bass]].<ref>{{cite web|author=SiriusXM|title=Badflower with Lance Bass "A Lot to Say" // SiriusXM // OutQ|website=[[YouTube]]|date=2013-06-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzrgrSjUp68|accessdate=2016-12-23}}</ref> After a performance at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]], opening for [[Kongos (band)|Kongos]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.chloeatconcerts.com/kongos-badflower-take-troubadour/|title=Kongos and Badflower Take The Troubadour - chloe@concerts|date=2014-07-17|newspaper=chloe@concerts|access-date=2016-12-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224041615/http://www.chloeatconcerts.com/kongos-badflower-take-troubadour/|archive-date=2016-12-24|url-status=dead}}</ref> the band signed with former [[independent record label]] Hundred Handed and began recording their first music release.

Badflower released their debut single "Soap" via Hundred Handed records on March 4, 2015, and debuted its [[music video]] on [[Loudwire]] the same day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/badflower-soap-exclusive-video-premiere/|title=Badflower, 'Soap' - Exclusive Video Premiere|website=Loudwire|access-date=2016-12-23}}</ref> Shortly after the release the band flew to the [[United Kingdom]] to support [[Australians|Australian]] pop duo The [[The Veronicas|Veronicas]] and played to sold out venues including [[London]]'s Heaven. Then, upon returning home to the US, the band headed straight back on tour to play several showcases in [[Austin, Texas|Austin, TX]] for [[South by Southwest|SXSW]] and [[South by So What?!]] in [[Grand Prairie, Texas]] supporting [[Circa Survive]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.axs.com/south-by-so-what-2015-lineup-revealed-39160|title=South By So What?! 2015 lineup revealed|newspaper=AXS|access-date=2016-12-23}}</ref> A demo version of the band's song "Animal" was also used in record label executive [[John Varvatos]]'s show during [[New York Fashion Week]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/artist-news-premieres/badflower-premiere-new-song-animal/29745|title=Badflower Premiere New Song, "Animal"|date=2016-09-01|newspaper=Guitar World|access-date=2016-12-23}}</ref> The band was then flown out to [[New York City]] to showcase for Varvatos and head executives at [[Republic Records]] with the prospect of making a deal.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} After the performance, the label immediately began negotiations which included a buy-out from their previous deal with Hundred Handed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Impatient with the negotiations, the band took it upon themselves to begin recording an album in their garage. On March 10 the band signed with [[John Varvatos]] / [[Republic Records]]. When the conversation about making an [[album]] began, the band confessed they had already begun making it in their garage and submitted a nearly complete version of "Temper" to the label. To the band's surprise, the label loved the self-produced collection and began preparing to release the unanimous favorite, "Animal," as the first [[Single (music)|single]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://iamhighvoltage.com/2016/11/02/on-the-rise-badflower/|title=On The Rise: Badflower {{!}} High Voltage Magazine|website=iamhighvoltage.com|access-date=2016-12-23}}</ref> "Animal" was premiered on [[Guitar World]] website and released on September 1, 2016.<ref name=":0" /> Following the release of the single, the band performed across the US in support of [[Billy Talent]] on the "[[Afraid of Heights (Billy Talent album)|Afraid of Heights]]" tour in September, 16.

Josh Katz said the following about the single 'Ghost': "I was depressed and thinking about self-harm. So I just wrote it. I played out the whole scenario and put it into a song because that's what writers do, I suppose. I didn't even know if it was gonna go on the album. I was sorta hesitant to even show it to the rest of my band, But everyone heard it and loved it".<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rawmusictv.com/article/amp/2019/A-Beginners-Guide-to-Badflower-and-10-facts-about-the-band | title = A Beginners Guide to Badflower and 10 facts about the band | date = April 29, 2019 | accessdate = April 29, 2019 }}</ref>
