'''Looking Glass''' is an American [[pop rock]] group of the early 1970s that was part of the [[Jersey Shore sound]]. Their 1972 song "[[Brandy (You're a Fine Girl)]]" was a #1 hit on both the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and [[Cash Box Top 100|''Cash Box'' Top 100]] charts, remaining in the top position for one week.

==Career==
The group was formed in 1969, at [[Rutgers University]] in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]], New Jersey. The original version of the band broke up after college, with original members [[Elliot Lurie]] and Larry Gonsky recruiting two new members to form the classic Looking Glass lineup:<ref>{{cite web|last=Eder |first=Bruce |url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/looking-glass/biography/ |title=Looking Glass Biography – Yahoo!

The group had the [[chart-topper|#1]] [[hit single]] for the week of August 26, 1972 with "[[Brandy (You're a Fine Girl)]]", written by Lurie;<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/> and also a [[Top 40]] hit "[[Jimmy Loves Mary-Anne]]" (1973), subsequently recorded by [[Josie Cotton]]. "Brandy (You're a Fine Girl)" was released in the US in June 1972. It topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for one week and remained on the chart for 16 weeks.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/> This [[gramophone record|disc]], their only million seller, was [[music recording sales certification|certified gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] on August 9, 1972.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/>

Guitarist Brendan Harkin joined Looking Glass in early 1974, and Lurie left soon afterward to pursue a solo career, replaced by Michael Lee Smith, a singer from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Later that same year, the group changed its name to Fallen Angels. After [[Richie Ranno]] joined as second guitarist in September 1975, keyboardist Gonsky departed, and by late 1975, Fallen Angels's name had changed once again to [[Starz (band)|Starz]]. Lurie appeared as a solo artist with "Your Love Song," an entry on [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s "Easy Listening" [[record chart|chart]] in 1974.

Sweval died on January 23, 1990,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utopiaartists.com/bio_looking_glass.htm |title=Looking Glass Bio |publisher=Utopia Artists |access-date=2012-11-11}}</ref> having succumbed to [[AIDS]].<ref>[http://themusicsover.com/2010/01/23/peter-sweval-starz/ >>Died On This Date (January 23, 1990) Peter Sweval / Looking Glass; Starz @TheMusicsOver.com] Retrieved 12-31-2015.</ref><ref>[http://starzfanzcentral.yuku.com/topic/380/Remembering-PIETER-SWEVAL Remembering PIETER SWEVAL in Original Starz Board Forum] Retrieved 12-31-2015.</ref>

In 2003, Lurie reconstituted the group with new musicians.
