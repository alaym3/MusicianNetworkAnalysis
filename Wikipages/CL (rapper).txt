Following the group's hiatus at the turn of 2015, CL pursued a solo career with the release of the standalone singles "[[Hello Bitches]]" (2015) and "[[Lifted (CL song)|Lifted]]" (2016). The latter single led CL to become the first female Korean solo artist to place onto the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and the third Korean artist to do so overall. In November 2016, YG announced the disbandment of 2NE1 after nearly two years of hiatus, and CL subsequently remained under the label. Shortly after leaving YG in December 2019, she released her solo [[Extended play|EP]] project ''In the Name of Love'' (2019), consisting of six tracks written during the three years since her previous single "Lifted". Her debut studio album, ''[[Alpha (CL album)|Alpha]]'', was released in October 2021.

Known for experimentation across music styles as well as her live performances, CL is regarded as an influential figure in the international spread of the [[Korean wave]]. Beyond the field of music, she is recognized as a style icon by numerous worldwide publications.
