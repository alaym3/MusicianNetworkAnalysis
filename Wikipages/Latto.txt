===2016–2018: Career beginnings and ''The Rap Game''===
In 2016, Stephens became a contestant on the [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] reality series ''[[The Rap Game]]'', produced by [[Jermaine Dupri]] and [[Queen Latifah]]. The boot camp-style series followed young aspiring rappers in a competition against one another over a span of eight weeks. Latto, under the stage name "Miss Mulatto" at the time, was the overall winner of the competition. She was offered a recording contract from Dupri with [[So So Def Recordings|So So Def Records]] but ultimately turned down the deal claiming it wasn't enough money, opting to be an independent artist.<ref>{{Citation|title=Miss Mulatto on Turning Down Jermaine Dupri Deal: "It Wasn't Enough Money" (Part 3) - Hip Hot Hip Hop|date=March 17, 2018|url=https://hiphothiphop.com/miss-mulatto-on-turning-down-jermaine-dupri-deal-it-wasnt-enough-money-part-3/|access-date=May 26, 2019}}</ref>
