==Early and personal life==
Brian Patrick Carroll was born on May 13, 1969 to Tom and Nancy Carroll and is the youngest of five siblings along with Lynn, Lisa, Lori, and John.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laverneonline.com/2009/11/09/death-taxes-and-athletic-director-tom-carroll/ |title=Death, Taxes and Damien Athletic Director Tom Carroll |publisher=Laverneonline.com |date=2009-11-09 |access-date=2014-07-11 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307134550/http://www.laverneonline.com/2009/11/09/death-taxes-and-athletic-director-tom-carroll/ |archive-date=March 7, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> His father was the Athletic Director at [[Damien High School]] from 1973 until his retirement in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailybulletin.com/sports/20140905/longtime-damien-athletic-director-tom-carroll-passes-at-84|title=Longtime Damien athletic director Tom Carroll passes at 84|access-date=August 14, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810013655/http://www.dailybulletin.com/sports/20140905/longtime-damien-athletic-director-tom-carroll-passes-at-84|archive-date=August 10, 2017|df=mdy-all|date=September 5, 2014}}</ref>

Carroll grew up in a Southern California suburb near [[Disneyland]]. In his youth, he was an introvert, and spent most of his time in his room with books, games, martial-arts movie memorabilia, and toys. He also spent a lot of time at Disneyland.<ref name="MTV.com"/>

Carroll began playing guitar at the age of 12. He learned to play from an elderly man down the road. He is quoted as saying, however, he became serious a year later after he moved from [[Huntington Beach, California]] to [[Claremont, California|Claremont]]. His playing improved with lessons from various teachers at a local music store. His early teachers included Max McGuire, Johnny Fortune, Mark Hammond, Pebber Brown, [[Joey Tafolla]], and [[Paul Gilbert]]. In 2003, Buckethead played a tribute to all his early teachers as the Deli Creeps played a show at Styles Music's 25th anniversary. He then began making demo recordings of both his playing as well as his writing styles, which would later be released in 2007–2008.

The Buckethead persona came to be when Carroll saw the 1988 [[horror movie]] ''[[Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers|Halloween 4]]'' and was inspired by the film. He went out right after seeing it and bought a [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]]-like white mask. The bucket idea came later that night while eating chicken:<ref name="spin.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2017/10/buckethead-heart-condition-podcast/|title=Buckethead Talks Struggles With Heart Condition in Rare Out-of-Character Interview|date=October 12, 2017|access-date=October 13, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013123630/https://www.spin.com/2017/10/buckethead-heart-condition-podcast/|archive-date=October 13, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

After that, I wanted to be that thing all the time.|Buckethead, 1996, ''Guitar Player'' Magazine <ref name="MTV.com"/>}}

In October 2017, Carroll gave a rare out-of-character interview discussing all ranges of his life, the Buckethead character, his parents' deaths, his health problems, and how he copes with overcoming fear.<ref name="spin.com"/> During the podcast, he revealed he has been diagnosed with the potentially life-threatening condition of [[heart arrhythmia]]. He stated he had a [[cardiac ablation]] performed and uses medicine to control the problem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/buckethead-life-threatening-heart-condition/|title=Buckethead Reveals Life-Threatening Heart Condition|website=Loudwire|access-date=October 13, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012173306/http://loudwire.com/buckethead-life-threatening-heart-condition/|archive-date=October 12, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Career==
===1988–1994: Early solo career and Praxis===
In 1988, after leaving the band Class-X, Carroll entered a song called "Brazos" into a ''[[Guitar Player]]'' magazine contest. It was a runner-up, with editors writing:

{{quotation|An astonishingly skilled guitarist and bassist, he demonstrates post-[[Paul Gilbert]] speed and accuracy filtered through very kinky harmonic sensibilities. His psychotronic, demonic edge is very, very far removed from the clichés of classical metal and rock. A real talent to watch, also known as "Buckethead."<ref>''Guitar Player'' magazine 1988</ref>}}

In the same year, the magazine's editor, Jas Obrecht, came to know of Buckethead when Carroll and his parents left a demo recording at the magazine's reception desk for Obrecht. Impressed with this demo, he rushed into the restaurant where Buckethead and his parents were having lunch and encouraged him to make the most of his talent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://youngbuckethead.com/ |title=YoungBucketHead Premium Cigarettes |publisher=Youngbuckethead.com |date=2013-11-10 |access-date=2014-07-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521110157/http://www.youngbuckethead.com/ |archive-date=May 21, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> They soon became friends. In 1989, a song called "Soowee" by Buckethead got honorable mention in another song contest. In 1991, Buckethead moved into Obrecht's basement. The song "Brazos" was eventually released on the 1991 demo tape of his band [[Deli Creeps]], titled "Tribal Rites", and again as bonus material in Buckethead's ''Secret Recipe'' DVD in 2006. Luke Sacco was his teacher.

In 1991, Buckethead contributed to [[Derek Bailey (guitarist)|Derek Bailey]]'s [[Company (free improvisation group)|Company]] project alongside, among others, [[John Zorn]] and [[Alexander Bălănescu]], resulting in a triple album called ''Company 91''.

After his first two demo tapes, called ''Giant Robot'' and ''Bucketheadland Blueprints'', Buckethead released ''[[Bucketheadland]]'' on [[John Zorn]]'s Japanese Avant record label in 1992. Though available only as a pricey import, the record received positive reviews and earned some attention. At about this time, Buckethead fell into the orbit of prolific bassist/producer [[Bill Laswell]], himself an occasional Zorn collaborator; Buckethead (as a performer, producer, or composer) was introduced to Laswell with the help of Limbomaniacs drummer [[Bryan Mantia|Bryan "Brain" Mantia]], who gave Laswell a video of Buckethead playing in his room.<ref>[http://www.tedkurland.com/pbuild/linkbuilder.cfm?selection=doc.271] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061215182308/http://www.tedkurland.com/pbuild/linkbuilder.cfm?selection=doc.271 |date=December 15, 2006 }}</ref> Buckethead soon became Laswell's second staple guitar player, besides [[Nicky Skopelitis]].

In 1992, Buckethead, with Bill Laswell, [[Bernie Worrell]], [[Bootsy Collins]], and [[Bryan Mantia|Bryan "Brain" Mantia]], formed the [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Praxis (band)|Praxis]]. Their first album, ''[[Transmutation (Mutatis Mutandis)]]'', released the same year, was well received. The project was Bill Laswell's concept, and has since involved other guests such as [[Serj Tankian]] of [[System of a Down]], among many others. Buckethead participated in every release except the initial ''[[1984 (Praxis album)|1984]]'' release and ''[[Mold (Praxis album)|Mold]]'' (1998).

In 1993, Buckethead auditioned to play for the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]. The band eventually ended up with [[Arik Marshall]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kiedis|first1=Anthony|last2=Sloman|first2=Larry|title=Scar Tissue|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VUSZAAAAQBAJ|year=2004|publisher=Hachette|isbn=9781401381769}}</ref> and later [[Dave Navarro]]. After some legal complications with [[Sony Music Entertainment]], Buckethead decided to release his 1994 album ''[[Dreamatorium]]'' under the name of Death Cube K (an [[anagram]]).

{{quotation|Death Cube K is a separate entity that looks like a photographic negative version of Buckethead with a black chrome mask, like Darth Vader. This apparition haunts Buckethead and appears in his nightmares.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bucketheadland.com/faq/index.html#anchor1786800 |title=Buckethead FAQ v 1.0 |publisher=Bucketheadland.com |access-date=2012-02-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230003000/http://bucketheadland.com/faq/index.html#anchor1786800 |archive-date=December 30, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>}}

Buckethead released a second studio album that year, ''[[Giant Robot (Buckethead album)|Giant Robot]]'', which features many guest appearances by artists such as [[Iggy Pop]] and [[Bill Moseley]]. The name of the album came from the Japanese series ''[[Giant Robo (tokusatsu)|Johnny Sokko and his Flying Robot]]'', of which Buckethead is a fan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bucketheadland.com/faq/index.html#anchor6301 |title=in the lower part were it says " Acknowledgments" |publisher=Bucketheadland.com |access-date=2012-02-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230003000/http://bucketheadland.com/faq/index.html#anchor6301 |archive-date=December 30, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> He also released two other albums with [[Praxis (band)|Praxis]], their second and third studio efforts: ''[[Sacrifist]]'' and ''[[Metatron (Praxis album)|Metatron]]''.

===1995–1999: Collaboration work, movie soundtracks and Praxis===
In 1995, Buckethead did not release any solo albums but collaborated with several artists like [[Jonas Hellborg]] and [[Michael Shrieve]] (''Octave of the Holy Innocents''). He also contributed to several movie soundtracks, such as ''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat (soundtrack)|Mortal Kombat]]''.

Later, in 1996, Buckethead released his solo album ''[[The Day of the Robot]]'' with the help of English producer DJ Ninj and Laswell, plus another album with [[Bryan Mantia|Brain]] and keyboardist Pete Scaturro on the small Japanese label NTT Records, called ''Giant Robot''. Both albums were printed only in small quantities and are collectors' items now. A second demo tape by the [[Deli Creeps]] was also recorded.

Also in 1996, several [[Sega Saturn]] television ads featuring a screaming mask-like face pressing through the blue orb of the Saturn logo was released, with music by Buckethead.

In 1997, Buckethead began working on the album ''Buckethead Plays Disney'', but the album has not yet been released. According to his Web page:

{{quotation|This highly anticipated album, once listed in an Avant catalog, has yet to be completed. It is Buckethead's most precious personal project, so he won't record or release it until he knows he is ready.<ref>{{cite web |first=Robert |last=White |url=http://www.bucketheadland.com/faq/faq2/FAQ_2_0.html#34 |title=FAQ 2.0 |publisher=Bucketheadland.com |access-date=2012-02-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115151612/http://www.bucketheadland.com/faq/faq2/FAQ_2_0.html#34 |archive-date=November 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>}}

Also in 1997, Buckethead continued to contribute to movie soundtracks, appearing on ''[[Beverly Hills Ninja#Music|Beverly Hills Ninja]]'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (soundtrack)|Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]]'', the sequel to ''Mortal Kombat''.

Further releases were [[Arcana (jazz band)|Arcana's]] second and final studio album ''[[Arc of the Testimony]]'' in which he played with noted drummer [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]] and the one-off project ''Pieces'', with [[Bryan Mantia|Brain]]. Two live albums by Praxis, called ''[[Transmutation Live]]'' and ''Live in Poland'' (featuring recordings from European concerts) were also issued.

Death Cube K released an album that year called ''[[Disembodied (Buckethead album)|Disembodied]]''.

In 1998, Buckethead released ''[[Colma (album)|Colma]]'', an album dedicated to his mother, who at the time was suffering from [[colon cancer]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archives.citypaper.net/articles/111199/feat.20q.shtml |title=Buckethead |publisher=Archives.citypaper.net |access-date=2012-02-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109100522/http://archives.citypaper.net/articles/111199/feat.20q.shtml |archive-date=January 9, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The same year saw a compilation album by Praxis called ''Collection''.

In 1999, Buckethead released his fifth album, a collaboration with [[Les Claypool]] from the band [[Primus (band)|Primus]], titled ''[[Monsters and Robots]]'' — currently the best-selling album of his career. This album includes the song "[[The Ballad of Buckethead]]", for which his first music video ever was made.<ref>{{cite web |first=Robert |last=White |url=http://www.bucketheadland.com/faq/faq2/FAQ_2_0.html#18 |title=FAQ 2.0 |publisher=Bucketheadland.com |access-date=2012-02-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115151612/http://www.bucketheadland.com/faq/faq2/FAQ_2_0.html#18 |archive-date=November 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>
Buckethead began three new projects that year, the first being the band [[Cornbugs]], a collaboration with actor [[Bill Moseley]], drummer [[Pinchface]], and later keyboardist [[Travis Dickerson]]. Another project, Cobra Strike with an album called ''The 13th Scroll'', featured Pinchface, [[Bryan "Brain" Mantia]], [[DJ Disk]], and [[Bill Laswell]]. Buckethead also began a collaboration with actor [[Viggo Mortensen]], whom he first met through a recording project called ''Myth: Dreams of the World''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.specialrealms.com/VM/interviewarchive75.html |title="The Many Faces Of Viggo Mortensen" Interview Archive |publisher=Specialrealms.com |access-date=2012-02-29 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421031050/http://www.specialrealms.com/VM/interviewarchive75.html |archive-date=April 21, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> in 1996. Together they released ''One Man's Meat'', ''One Less Thing to Worry About'', and ''The Other Parade''. Buckethead contributed to the 1999 album [[Devil Dub]] by the San Francisco Bay Area band [[Ben Wa (band)|Ben Wa]] consisting of "Dr. Ware" and "House"(Limbomaniacs, [[Tommy Guerrero]], Buckethead's Giant Robot, MCM & the Monster).<ref>{{cite web|last=Spano |first=Charles |url={{Allmusic|class=artist |id=p485306 |pure_url=yes}} |title=Ben Wa – Music Biography, Credits and Discography |publisher=AllMusic |date=2001-08-21 |access-date=2012-06-26}}</ref>

===2000–2004: Guns N' Roses and other projects===
Buckethead achieved a higher public profile as lead guitarist for [[Guns N' Roses]] from 2000 to 2004.<ref>{{cite web |last=Saidman |first=Sorelle |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429767/20000315/guns_n_roses.jhtml |title=MTV news on "Buckethead in, Freese out" |publisher=Mtv.com |date=March 15, 2000 |access-date=2012-02-29 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510012948/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429767/20000315/guns_n_roses.jhtml |archive-date=May 10, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> He recorded the often-delayed album ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'' with the band and appeared live on stage in 2001 and 2002, including ''[[Rock in Rio 3]]'', [[MTV]]'s ''[[MTV Video Music Awards#2000s|Video Music Awards]]'', and parts of the [[Chinese Democracy Tour]].

Despite being a member of GN'R, Buckethead released his sixth studio album, called ''[[Somewhere Over the Slaughterhouse]]'' in 2001, and also his only [[Extended play|EP]], called ''KFC Skin Piles''. He also released two albums with his band [[Cornbugs]], and a third under his 'Death Cube K' pseudonym. In 2000, Buckethead released the second and last album by Cobra Strike, called ''[[Cobra Strike II - Y, Y+B, X+Y]]''. He joined two new projects during this period. The first was the progressive rock band Thanatopsis (named after a poem by [[William Cullen Bryant]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tdrsmusic.com/thanatopsis.html|title=Thanatopsis|website=Tdrsmusic.com|access-date=May 11, 2021}}</ref>) with Travis Dickerson and drummer Ramy Antoun;<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p508886|pure_url=yes}} |title=Thanatopsis > Overview |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2008-11-13 }}</ref> this group went on to release four albums. Some Thanatopsis material has also appeared on albums released by Buckethead and Dickerson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tdrsmusic.com/forum2/index.php?topic=2893.0|title=Thanatopsis "Requiem"|website=Tdrsmusic.com|access-date=May 11, 2021}}</ref>
Buckethead's second side project during this period was with Bill Laswell and Japanese producer [[Shin Terai]], released as the album ''[[Unison (Shin Terai album)|Unison]]''.

In 2002, Buckethead released three studio albums: ''Funnel Weaver'', a collection of 49 short tracks, ''[[Bermuda Triangle (album)|Bermuda Triangle]]'', and finally, ''[[Electric Tears]]'', a calming album that is similar to his earlier release, ''Colma''.
When Laswell was not able to play with Praxis at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts festival, Les Claypool asked to jam with Brain, Bernie Worrell, and Buckethead, forming a new [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] called [[Colonel Claypool's Bucket of Bernie Brains]]. The [[jamband]] experiment was successful enough to do some further live dates.

Later, in 2003, marking the release of his tenth studio album, Buckethead released the sequel of his debut ''[[Bucketheadland]]'', simply called ''[[Bucketheadland 2]]''. Together with actor [[Viggo Mortensen]], he did ''[[Pandemoniumfromamerica]]'', and with Thanatopsis, its second release, called ''Axiology''.

Buckethead's relationship with Guns N' Roses was somewhat erratic in its last year, despite contractual obligations. According to an interview with Rose, he seemingly 'left' the band in January 2004 without telling anyone, and 'rejoined' in a similar manner in February. "His transient lifestyle has made it impossible for even his closest friends to have nearly any form of communication with him whatsoever."<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.heretodaygonetohell.com/articles/showarticle.php?articleid=104 |title=Guns N' Roses Not Able to Perform at Rock in Rio |publisher=Here Today...

Since that time, his [[cult following]] in the [[underground music]] communities has steadily increased. He frequently performs at festivals and in clubs nationwide and often tours as the feature performer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sonoma/03.13.03/buckethead-0311.html |title=Metroactive Music &#124; Buckethead |publisher=Metroactive.com |access-date=2012-02-29 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002123315/http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sonoma/03.13.03/buckethead-0311.html |archive-date=October 2, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bingebuddies.com/Promo_index.htm |title=Buckethead at Bingebuddies.Com – Binge Goodies |publisher=Bingebuddies.com |access-date=2012-02-29 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311002516/http://www.bingebuddies.com/Promo_index.htm |archive-date=March 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The year 2004 saw the release of three new studio albums: ''Island of Lost Minds'', which was his first tour-only album being later re-released by TDRS Music; ''[[Population Override]]'', a blues-rock tour de force with Dickerson; and ''[[The Cuckoo Clocks of Hell]]'', considered his heaviest effort to date. The latter includes "[[Spokes for the Wheel of Torment]]," for which Syd Garon and Eric Henry made a music video based on the famous [[triptych]]s by [[Hieronymus Bosch]]. Buckethead also recorded the final two albums by the [[Cornbugs]], ''[[Brain Circus]]'' and ''Donkey Town'' as well as another release with [[Viggo Mortensen]] called ''Please Tomorrow'' and a second with [[Shin Terai]], titled ''[[Heaven & Hell (Shin Terai album)|Heaven & Hell]]''. [[C2B3]] also released their only album, ''[[The Big Eyeball in the Sky]]'', and toured it in North America.

In an interview with ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'', [[Ozzy Osbourne]] stated that he had offered to have Buckethead play guitar in his band at [[Ozzfest]], but changed his mind after meeting with him and realizing that he would not remove his costume:
{{Quote box

===2005–2006: Buckethead & Friends===
[[File:Belly up 2006 with that 1 guy.jpg|thumbnail|Buckethead and That 1 Guy, performing as The Frankenstein Brothers in 2006.]]
In 2005, Buckethead released the album ''[[Enter the Chicken]]'' through [[Serj Tankian]]'s record label, [[Serjical Strike Records|Serjical Strike]]. The album features Tankian himself, [[Maximum Bob (singer)|Maximum Bob]] (of the [[Deli Creeps]]), [[Death by Stereo]] singer [[Efrem Shulz]], [[Bad Acid Trip]] and others.<ref name="Buckknows">Leroy, Dan, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070212011322/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7702911/buckethead_knows_chicken Buckethead Knows Chicken], ''Rolling Stone'', Oct 13, 2005. Retrieved January 6, 2009 </ref> It is marked by its leaning toward more traditional song structures while still featuring typical Buckethead guitar skills. "[[We Are One (Buckethead song)|We Are One]]" was released as a single and also appeared on the soundtrack of ''[[Masters of Horror (soundtrack)|Masters of Horror]]''. "[[Enter the Chicken#Three Fingers|Three Fingers]]" was used for the soundtrack of the horror movie ''[[Saw II]]''. The final track, "Nottingham Lace", was first made public via his home page and soon became a concert staple and one of his most popular songs. Buckethead also released two further solo albums in 2005, ''[[Kaleidoscalp]]'' and ''Inbred Mountain''—the latter being the first album as a solo artist released on the label TDRS Music. Both albums originally were sold exclusively at concerts and only later got an official release through the label's website.

Buckethead released albums with other bands that year: with [[Cornbugs]], he released two compilation albums, called ''[[Rest Home for Robots]]'' and ''Skeleton Farm''. Gorgone's ''self titled album'' was released that year' itself based upon recording sessions from the album ''[[Population Override]]'' that Buckethead released in 2004.

In 2006, the cross-console video game ''[[Guitar Hero II]]'' was launched, featuring Buckethead's song "[[Jordan (Buckethead composition)|Jordan]]" as an unlockable bonus track. Although the song has been performed live in the past, the video game version is the only known studio recording of the song. When playing it live, Buckethead would almost always simply perform the verse and chorus of "Jordan" before transitioning into the next song. However, the ''Guitar Hero II'' version contains a special solo created specifically for the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guitarworld.com/guitar_heros_marcus_henderson_the_guitar_world_interview?page=0,3 |title=Guitar Hero's Marcus Henderson: The Guitar World Interview – Page 4 |publisher=Guitar World |date=2007-06-20 |access-date=2014-07-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224234842/http://www.guitarworld.com/guitar_heros_marcus_henderson_the_guitar_world_interview?page=0%2C3 |archive-date=February 24, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>

Also the same year, Buckethead released two DVDs, titled ''[[Young Buckethead Vol. 1]]'' and ''[[Young Buckethead Vol. 2]]'', featuring rare footage from 1990 and 1991. The DVD also contains three complete [[Deli Creeps]] shows, a sound check, backstage footage, and solo footage of just Buckethead. He also released the albums ''The Elephant Man's Alarm Clock'' and ''[[Crime Slunk Scene]]'', both sold on his tours but later sold on the TDRS Music website. The last album has the song "Soothsayer (Dedicated to Aunt Suzie)"; this song (along with "Jordan" and "Nottingham Lace") is one of his most popular songs and is often played live. Buckethead released his final compilation album with the band [[Cornbugs]], called ''Celebrity Psychos''. He also released an album with [[Travis Dickerson]], called ''Chicken Noodles'', a move that would see the start of a four-year long collaboration with the keyboardist. Buckethead's band Thanatopsis would also release ''[[Anatomize]]'' that year.

===2007–2010: Continued solo work and Michael Jackson tribute===
[[File:Insearchofthe910.JPG|left|thumb|190px|The massive ''[[In Search of The]]'' box set, a set of 13 albums by Buckethead, along with each copy's cover being hand-drawn differently.]]

In 2007, Buckethead released an unprecedented amount of new material. In February, a box set titled ''[[In Search of The]]'', containing 13 albums of original material, was released. It was handcrafted, numbered, and monogrammed by Buckethead and contained over nine hours of music. A regular solo album, called ''Pepper's Ghost'', was released in March. A disc of acoustic improvisations called ''[[Acoustic Shards]]'' was also released, becoming the twentieth studio album that the artist had released so far in his solo career. In midyear, he reissued his demo tape ''Bucketheadland Blueprints'', with two alternative album covers: a special edition with a hand-drawn cover made by him, or a standard edition with the original cover art. In October, he released his final two albums of the year, called  ''Decoding the Tomb of Bansheebot'' and ''Cyborg Slunks''. The latter again came in both a hand-drawn limited edition and (some weeks later) as a normal CD. Buckethead wrote three songs dedicated to Aunt Suzie in 2006-07: the aforementioned "Soothsayer" (Crime Slunk Scene), "Aunt Suzie" (Cyborg Slunks), and "Sail On Soothsayer", (Decoding The Tomb Of Bansheebot).

As ''Death Cube K'', Buckethead released two albums in 2007: an album called DCK, limited to 400 hand-numbered copies and released in August; and in December, the 5-CD box set ''Monolith'', which consisted of one unbroken track per CD.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://travisdickersonmusic.com/store/monolith.html |title=Monolith |publisher=Travisdickersonmusic.com |access-date=2012-02-29 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206184107/http://travisdickersonmusic.com/store/monolith.html |archive-date=February 6, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

During 2007, Buckethead also collaborated and appeared on numerous albums with other artists. The sequel to ''Chicken Noodles'' (a collaboration with [[Travis Dickerson]]), simply called ''Chicken Noodles II'', was issued by TDRS in December.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://travisdickersonmusic.com/store/chicken_noodles2.html |title=Chicken Noodles 2 |publisher=Travisdickersonmusic.com |access-date=2012-02-29 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206184044/http://travisdickersonmusic.com/store/chicken_noodles2.html |archive-date=February 6, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> A live record by [[Praxis (band)|Praxis]], titled ''[[Tennessee 2004]]''; the third album with [[Shin Terai]], called ''Lightyears''; and another album with drummer [[Bryan Mantia]], called ''Kevin's Noodle House'', were also released through the year.

That same year, it was revealed that Buckethead joined a project by the name of [[Science Faxtion]], a band featuring bassist [[Bootsy Collins]] and drummer [[Bryan Mantia|Bryan "Brain" Mantia]], with [[Greg Hampton]] supplying lead vocals. Their first album, called ''[[Living on Another Frequency]]'', was delayed several times and was finally released in November 2008.
[[File:Wakarusa 2008.jpg|thumbnail|right|Buckethead live at [[Wakarusa Music and Camping Festival|Wakarusa]], 2008]]
On January 1, 2008, the band [[Praxis (band)|Praxis]] released the long-awaited album ''[[Profanation (Preparation for a Coming Darkness)]]'' in Japan. The album had actually been recorded in 2005, but had to be put on hold when the original label went bankrupt. That year Buckethead released ''[[From the Coop]]'' through the label Avabella (where he released ''Acoustic Shards''), consisting of the demos Buckethead gave to Jas Obrecht back in 1988. This CD also included the first ever "official" biography of/by the artist. Later that same year, he announced the release of the album called ''Albino Slug'' (a tour-only CD until official release on December of the same year). Along with this album, he appeared on the album ''The Dragons of Eden'', with Dickerson and Mantia, and in collaboration with [[That 1 Guy]] as the ''Frankenstein Brothers'', an album called ''[[Bolt on Neck]]'' was released. [[That 1 Guy]] and Buckethead toured together through fall 2008, playing songs from this album.

Buckethead also appeared in the [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''[[American Music: Off the Record]]'', in which he appears only playing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0887710/ |title=American Music: Off the Record (2008) |publisher=Imdb.com |access-date=2012-02-29}}</ref> [[Serj Tankian]]'s label, [[Serjical Strike]], reissued the album ''[[Enter the Chicken]]'' with an extra song. Furthermore, Buckethead contributed to one track of actor [[Viggo Mortensen]]'s album ''At All'', and with Travis Dickerson and filmmaker Alix Lambert on the album ''Running After Deer''.

Buckethead appeared with [[Bootsy Collins]] in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], to promote the vote for the [[2008 United States presidential election]] for the organization [[Rock the Vote]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gvpLaMdc3M|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151113232511/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gvpLaMdc3M|url-status=dead|title=- YouTube|archive-date=November 13, 2015|access-date=May 11, 2021}}</ref>
He also joined Collins on ''Fallen Soldiers Memorial'', an album with proceeds going to the ''National Fallen Heroes Foundation''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bootsycollins.com/newsfull.php?newsId=119 |title=Bootzilla Productions &#124; News |publisher=Bootsycollins.com |access-date=2012-02-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224054158/http://www.bootsycollins.com/newsfull.php?newsId=119 |archive-date=February 24, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

More than four years after his departure from the band [[Guns N' Roses]], ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'' was made available. Buckethead appears on all but two songs and was given writing credits on "Shackler's Revenge" (which appeared in the popular video game ''[[Rock Band 2]]''); "Scraped"; and "Sorry", which features guest singer [[Sebastian Bach]]. The album features eleven of Buckethead's [[guitar]] [[Solo (music)|solo]]s.

On December 30, 2008, Buckethead released two new tracks via his website to honor the 24th birthday of basketball player [[LeBron James]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/fantasy/01/15/thursday.clicks/index.html | work=CNN | title=Fantasy Clicks: Chickens, a king and free throws – SI.com – Fantasy | date=January 15, 2009 | access-date=April 27, 2010 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629104819/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/fantasy/01/15/thursday.clicks/index.html | archive-date=June 29, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://bucketheadland.com/home_for_hemorrage.html |title=Welcome to Bucketheadland |publisher=Bucketheadland.com |date=December 30, 2008 |access-date=2012-02-29 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304023249/http://bucketheadland.com/home_for_hemorrage.html |archive-date=March 4, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> These tracks were later made available on the album, ''Slaughterhouse on the Prairie'', which was released a month later through TDRS Music. In 2009 he released the albums ''A Real Diamond in the Rough'', and ''Forensic Follies'', which was first sold at some of his tour dates but later released on TDRS. That year he also released the track ''[[The Homing Beacon]]'', a tribute to [[Michael Jackson]], who had been an early influence on him. The song was later included on his 2012 album ''[[Electric Sea (album)|Electric Sea]]''.

On February 5, 2010, Buckethead released an album called ''Shadows Between the Sky'' and later that month, [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] released the Buckethead Signature [[Gibson Les Paul|Les Paul]] guitar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/Les-Paul/Gibson-USA/Buckethead-Signature-Les-Paul.aspx |title=Gibson Buckethead Signature Les Paul |publisher=Gibson.com |access-date=2013-03-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210022814/http://www2.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/Les-Paul/Gibson-USA/Buckethead-Signature-Les-Paul.aspx |archive-date=February 10, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

On April 29, 2010, Buckethead's website was updated<ref name="http://www.bucketheadland.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.bucketheadland.com/ |title=Bucketheadland.com |publisher=Bucketheadland.com |access-date=2012-02-29 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020721125950/http://www.bucketheadland.com/ |archive-date=July 21, 2002 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> with a picture with the message "Greetings from Bucketheadland... Buckethead wants you to know he appreciates your support all these years, it means so much to him. Buckethead is having some animatronic parts replaced, Slip Disc snuck into the park and caused some mayhem." The mention of Slip Disc is a reference to a Bucketheadland nemesis found on the ''[[Bucketheadland]]'' album. Bootsy Collins continued to update his Twitter Web site about Buckethead's condition, stating that he had recently gone into therapy for a few months.

Nevertheless, after return from injury, on July 15, 2010, Buckethead, along with Brain and Melissa Reese, has released the first volume out of three 5-CD box sets called ''Best Regards''. On August 25, 2010, Buckethead announced his 28th studio album titled ''Spinal Clock'', which showcases his banjo skills. In October, two albums in collaboration with Brain were released, the first called ''Brain as Hamenoodle'', and the second installment of the "Regards" series with Brain and Melissa Reese called, ''Kind Regards''. Eventually, both projects were released on October 13. That month also saw a new solo album titled ''Captain EO's Voyage'' first available only on [[iTunes]]. It was later announced that a physical edition will be released on December 1.<ref name="itunes.apple.com">{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/album/captain-eos-voyage/id399552461?v0=9988&ign-mpt=uo%3D1 |title=Captain EO's Voyage by Buckethead – Download Captain EO's Voyage on iTunes |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=October 20, 2010 |access-date=2012-02-29 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110070218/https://itunes.apple.com/album/captain-eos-voyage/id399552461?v0=9988&ign-mpt=uo=1 |archive-date=November 10, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> This, along with Buckethead's final Travis Dickerson album were released on November 29.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tdrsmusic.com/cgi-bin/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=TDRS;action=display;num=1291045707;start= |title=Travis Dickerson Recording Studios Forum – Index |publisher=Tdrsmusic.com |access-date=2012-02-29 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501062903/http://www.tdrsmusic.com/cgi-bin/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=TDRS |archive-date=May 1, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In May 2010, Buckethead started to release albums under the concept of a kiosk within Buckethead's fictional "abusement" park called "Buckethead Pikes". The albums released within this concept were to resemble a comic book style and be shorter in length than his previous works at around half an hour in length.

===2011–2015: Focus on solo ''Pikes''===
[[File:Buckethead Syracuse.jpg|thumbnail|right|Buckethead live in Syracuse, 2011]]

Buckethead left Praxis in 2011, the Frankenstein Brothers in 2012, and Brain in 2013. He contributed to two tracks on [[Lawson Rollins]]'s album ''Elevation'' in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawsonrollins.com/elevation.html |title=Lawson Rollins |work=lawsonrollins.com |access-date=January 22, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125152627/http://www.lawsonrollins.com/elevation.html |archive-date=January 25, 2016 |df=mdy }}</ref> He also departed from his live touring schedule, with his final performance taking place  on December 31, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bucketheadland.com/tour/|title=Buckethead on Tour|work=bucketheadland.com|access-date=July 26, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150823044607/http://bucketheadland.com/tour/|archive-date=August 23, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> During his absence from touring and other projects, Buckethead's solo release schedule increased speed dramatically- reaching a peak in 2015 with 118 albums, around one every three days on average. Notably, the cover of ''Pike 13'' contains a photograph of Buckethead unmasked; the first such image released to the public. The cover of ''Pike 13'' does not feature the common elements of the Pikes series, and is simply a photograph of Buckethead during his teenage years, carrying an acoustic guitar and hugging his father. Buckethead continued to release albums throughout the year, breaking the numerical order occasionally (for example, Pike 34 ''Pikes'' was released three weeks after Pike 35 ''Thank you Ohlinger's''). The final album of the year ''Wishes'' was released on December 24, free of charge for a limited time.

During 2014, Buckethead continued releasing albums at an even faster pace. Sixty albums were released throughout the year, averaging one album every six days.

===2016–present: Continued ''Pikes'', return to touring, and reissues===
[[File:Buckethead killswitch.jpg|thumb|Buckethead letting fans use the [[Kill switch#Musical instruments|kill switch]] on his guitar during his show at the [[Granada Theater (Lawrence, Kansas)|Granada]] in [[Lawrence, Kansas]] on April 15, 2016.]]

Throughout 2016, Buckethead's release output declined sharply, with only 24 albums being released. Pike 226, "Happy Birthday MJ 23" was released on the 53rd birthday of basketball player [[Michael Jordan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.bucketheadpikes.com/album/happy-birthday-mj-23|title=Happy Birthday MJ 23, by Bucketheadland|website=Bucketheadland|access-date=August 14, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814061038/http://music.bucketheadpikes.com/album/happy-birthday-mj-23|archive-date=August 14, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> 2016 also saw Buckethead return to touring, after a four-year absence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/04/buckethead-announces-first-tour-dates-in-four-years/|title=Buckethead announces first tour dates in four years|date=April 12, 2016|access-date=September 9, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908045415/http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/04/buckethead-announces-first-tour-dates-in-four-years/|archive-date=September 8, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

2017 saw a slight increase in pace compared to the previous year, with 30 albums being released in total. In addition, Buckethead began to repress part of his older catalogue in vinyl format, the first time in over a decade that his albums have been pressed in a physical format other than CD. Inbred Mountain, The Elephant Man's Alarm Clock, Crime Slunk Scene, Decoding the Tomb of Bansheebot, Albino Slug, Slaughterhouse on the Prairie, A Real Diamond in the Rough, and Shadows Between the Sky have all been announced so far. Several reissues come in a variety of different packages, unique to each release. Some of these included signed copies, limited-edition posters or photographs, personalized recordings, among other things. As part of these reissues, the albums Albino Slug and [[Decoding the Tombs of Bansheebot]] underwent major changes with songs being re-recorded, and their album cover and title changed as well. Pike 241 "Sparks in the Dark" has also been announced on vinyl.

Also announced was the release of "Bucketheadland 5-13 10-31", an entirely new album to be released on Halloween exclusively on vinyl. It is the first album since 2012's [[Electric Sea]] not to be a part of the Pike series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bucketheadpikes.com/BHland_vinyl.html|title="Bucketheadland 5-13 10 31" Vinyl Edition Pre Order|website=Bucketheadpikes.com|access-date=August 14, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818060721/http://www.bucketheadpikes.com/BHland_vinyl.html|archive-date=August 18, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In addition, [[Bootsy Collins]] announced he is working with Buckethead once again on a collaborative album set to be released in the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://liveforlivemusic.com/news/bootsy-collins-buckethead/|title=Bootsy Collins And Buckethead Have A Collaborative Album In The Works|date=May 17, 2017|access-date=August 14, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811104148/http://liveforlivemusic.com/news/bootsy-collins-buckethead/|archive-date=August 11, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Influences==
[[file:Bux Live 2018 2.jpg|thumb|left|Buckethead wearing a [[Michael Jordan]] jersey, a major influence on his songs.]]
Buckethead cites a wide variety of musical influences, including [[Michael Jackson]], [[Parliament-Funkadelic]], [[Shawn Lane]], [[Michael Schenker]], [[Uli Jon Roth]], [[Paul Gilbert]], [[Yngwie Malmsteen]], [[Joe Satriani]], [[Eddie Hazel]], [[Randy Rhoads]], [[Larry LaLonde]], [[Mike Patton]], James Cutri, [[Louis Johnson (bassist)|Louis Johnson]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Jennifer Batten]], [[The Residents]], [[Eddie Van Halen]] and [[Angus Young]], as well as the many artists he has collaborated with over the years.<ref name="Buckethead FAQ">{{cite web |title=Buckethead FAQ v 1.0 |url=http://www.bucketheadland.com/faq/index.html#anchor1777417 |publisher=www.bucketheadland.com |access-date=July 25, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230003000/http://bucketheadland.com/faq/index.html#anchor1777417 |archive-date=December 30, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In addition to his musical influences, Buckethead cites a diverse range of non-musical influences manifested in several ways out of which dedicated songs to said inspirations have been a staple of Buckethead's discography with  particular attention to basketball players like [[Michael Jordan]] (songs "[[Jordan (Buckethead composition)|Jordan]]" and "[[Monsters and Robots|Jump Man]]", album "Happy Birthday MJ 23"), [[George Gervin]] (on "Iceman"), [[Blake Griffin]] (on "Crack the Sky" and "Griffin's Spike"), [[Pete Maravich|"Pistol" Pete Maravich]] (on "The Mark of Davis"), [[LeBron James]] (with four songs dedicated to him), and [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] (album "Kareem's Footprint"). Other influences include martial artist and actor [[Bruce Lee]] (on "The Game of Death" song and inspiration behind the use of nunchakus on stage), author [[H. P. Lovecraft]] (on the "Lurker at the Threshold" suite, and his 55th Pike, ''The Miskatonic Scale''), numerous [[science fiction]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]] TV shows and movies including ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]'s ''[[The Holy Mountain (1973 film)|The Holy Mountain]]'' (on [[Kaleidoscalp]]), and ''[[Giant Robo (tokusatsu)|Giant Robo]]t'' (mentioned on several songs, albums, and episodes shown on stage).<ref name="Buckethead FAQ" /> [[Disney]] and [[Disneyland]] are also major influences on Buckethead's career.<ref name="Buckknows" /> Buckethead is also inspired by Japanese filmmaker [[Takashi Miike]], to whom a song on Pepper's Ghost is dedicated. ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' franchise of movies is also a big inspiration to him and he has written many songs such as Jowls, which are heavily inspired by those movies. The song "To Infinity and Beyond" from ''Out Orbit'' was dedicated to then-recently deceased basketball reporter [[Craig Sager]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bucketheadpikes.bandcamp.com/track/to-infinity-and-beyond-dedicated-to-craig-sager|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317165110/http://music.bucketheadpikes.com/track/to-infinity-and-beyond-dedicated-to-craig-sager|url-status=dead|title=To Infinity and Beyond (dedicated to Craig Sager), by Bucketheadland|archive-date=March 17, 2018|access-date=May 11, 2021}}</ref>
