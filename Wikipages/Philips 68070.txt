The '''SCC68070''' is a [[NXP Semiconductors|Philips Semiconductors]]-branded, [[Motorola 68000]]-based 16/32-bit processor produced under license.  While marketed externally as a high-performance [[microcontroller]], it has been almost exclusively used combined with the Philips SCC66470 VSC (Video- and Systems Controller) in the [[Philips CD-i]] interactive entertainment product line.

Additions to the [[Motorola 68000]] core include:

* Operation from 4 - 17.5 MHz
* Inclusion of a minimal, segmented [[Memory management unit|MMU]] supporting up to 16 MB of memory
* Built-in [[Direct Memory Access|DMA]] controller
* [[IÂ²C]] bus controller 
* [[Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter|UART]]
* 16-bit counter/[[Programmable interval timer|timer]] unit
* 2 match/count/[[Input capture|capture]]<!--correct?--> registers allowing the implementation of a pulse generator, event counter or reference timer
* Clock generator

Differences from the [[Motorola 68000]] core include these:

* Instruction execution timing is completely different
* Interrupt handling has been simplified
* The '''SCC68070''' has [[Motorola 68010|MC68010]] style bus-error recovery.  They are not compatible, so exception error processing is different.
* The '''SCC68070''' lacks a dedicated [[address generation unit]] (AGU), so operations requiring address calculation run slower due to contention with the shared ALU.  This means that most instructions take more cycles to execute, for some instructions significantly more, than a 68000.
* The MMU is not compatible with the [[Motorola 68451]] or any other "standard" [[Motorola]] [[Memory management unit|MMU]], so operating system code dealing with memory protection and address translation is not generally portable.  Enabling the [[Memory management unit|MMU]] also costs a wait state on each memory access.

While the '''SCC68070''' is mostly [[binary compatible]] with the [[Motorola 68000]], there is no equivalent chip in the [[Motorola]] [[Motorola 68000 family|680x0 series]].  In particular, the '''SCC68070''' is not a follow-on to the [[Motorola 68060]].

Even though the '''SCC68070''' is a 32-bit processor internally, it has a 24-bit [[address bus]], giving it a theoretical 16MB maximum [[random-access memory|RAM]]. However, this is not possible, as all of the on-board peripherals are mapped internally.
