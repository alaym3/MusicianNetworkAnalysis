'''Da Yoopers''' are a traveling comedy show and musical group from [[Ishpeming, Michigan]], United States. They are known primarily for their humorous songs and skits, most of which center on life in the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]]. The band's name includes the term "Yooper", slang for residents of that part of the state, and the use of "da" instead of "the" is typical of the [[Yooper dialect]]. Da Yoopers have released twelve studio albums and two compilations, all on You Guys Records. Many novelty songs from other groups are often incorrectly attributed to them including "Da Turdy Point Buck" and "Grandma got run Over by a Reindeer".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Da Yoopers Musical Comedy Show|url=https://dayoopers.com/travshw.html|url-status=live|access-date=February 27, 2021|website=Da Yoopers Official Website}}</ref> The group's members are Jim Bellmore (guitar, bass guitar, vocals, songwriting, production) and his wife, Lynn Bellmore ([[née]] Anderson) (keyboards, vocals), along with Jim "Hoolie" DeCaire (drums, vocals, songwriting, production). The original band lineup in 1985 consisted of Anderson and DeCaire, along with Joe Potila (guitar, vocals, songwriting, production) and Jim Pennell (bass guitar, vocals), with a number of membership changes ensuing throughout the band's history.

==History==
Da Yoopers was founded in 1975 by Jim "Hoolie" DeCaire and Joe Potila, two songwriters from [[Ishpeming, Michigan]]. After unsuccessful attempts at getting songs cut by other artists, they began recording as Da Yoopers in 1985.<ref name="today">{{cite web | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/319097938/ | title=Da Yoopers | work=The Country Today | date=June 14, 1995 | access-date=December 6, 2019 | pages=24}}</ref> The band's original lineup consisted of DeCaire on drums and Potila on guitar, with both men also handling songwriting and production duties; completing the initial lineup were keyboardist Lynn Anderson and bassist Jim Pennell.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p30907/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=allmusic Da Yoopers: Biography |access-date=July 21, 2007 |last=Weber |first=Barry |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> They were originally known as the Joe Arkansas Band.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/189516128/ | title=Area fans say 'yah' to U.P.

A second album, ''Culture Shock'', was released a year later. This second album featured several comedy songs, including "Second Week of Deer Camp" and "Rusty Chevrolet" (the latter a parody of "[[Jingle Bells]]"), both of which became local hits,<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="yoop">{{cite web |url=http://personal.ashland.edu/~jpiirto/da%20yoopers.htm |title=Da Yoopers Deconstructed |last=Piirto |first=Jane |access-date=July 21, 2007 |work=A Location in the Upper Peninsula}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9bYLAAAAIBAJ&pg=6725,9069818&dq=da-yoopers&hl=en |title= Da Yoopers Sing U.P.

By the release of ''Camp Fever'', the band's third album, Joe DeLongchamp had replaced Pennell as bass guitarist.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oWkaAAAAIBAJ&pg=7000,4134957&dq=joe-delongchamp&hl=en |title= Let's Hear it for Da Yoopers, Once |last= Kloss |first= Gerald |date= July 30, 1989 |work= Milwaukee Journal |access-date= October 13, 2011}}</ref> In addition, Lynn Anderson married Jerry Coffey, who joined as percussionist and occasional drummer.<ref name="allmusic"/> It also included the first song of the band's career not to be written by Potila or DeCaire, as DeLongchamp wrote the title track. ''Yoop It Up'', their fourth cassette, was released in 1989.

===Early 1990s–present===
''Yoopy Do Wah'', released in 1991, was the band's first album on [[compact disc]],<ref name="allmusic"/> released shortly after Dave "Doc" Bradbury took over on bass guitar. Also that year, a compilation titled ''For Diehards Only'' was released, featuring a selection of songs from the group's first four albums. Da Yoopers' 1993 album ''One Can Short of a Six-Pack'' featured both regular and Christmas songs, including a parody of "[[Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer]]" titled "Grandpa Got Run Over By a Beer Truck". Potila retired in 1995 and was replaced by Jim Bellmore, who also assumed Potila's former role as co-writer and co-producer with DeCaire. Also at this point "Cowboy" Dan Collins joined as rhythm guitarist and occasional vocalist.<ref name="today"/> Bellmore's first studio appearance was on ''We're Still Rockin''' that same year. Potila died in 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.genealogybuff.com/mi/marquette/webbbs_config.pl/noframes/read/52|title=Marquette County, Michigan Obituary Collection - 52}}</ref>

Two albums were released in 2000: ''Jackpine Savage'' and ''Naked Elves in Cowboy Boots'', the latter an album of Christmas music. Both Dan Collins and Jerry Coffey left shortly after ''Naked Elves in Cowboy Boots''. ''Songs for Fart Lovers'' and ''Diehards II'' (a second compilation composed of songs from the first four albums) both came out in 2004, with the two-disc ''21st Century Yoopers in Space'' following in 2006. This album also featured several guest contributions in both performing and songwriting. Lynn, who divorced Jerry in 2005, was again credited as Lynn Anderson on ''21st Century Yoopers in Space'', and married Bellmore shortly after that album's release. The last touring lineup consisted of the Bellmores, Lusardi, Symons, and DeCaire.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/293346156 | title=It's music to your ears | work=Manitowoc Herald Times | date=August 19, 2010 | access-date=December 6, 2019 | author=Suzanne Weiss | pages=B1, B2}}</ref>

==Tourist Trap==

Da Yoopers also own and operate a gift shop near Ishpeming called "Da Yoopers Tourist Trap", located in Ishpeming. This gift shop features various Upper Peninsula-themed merchandise.<ref name="yoop"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MWSB&p_theme=mwsb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB8272A6724938B&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Da Yoopers' Store Offers a Yoo-nique Tourist Experience |access-date= August 14, 2008 |last= Maller |first= Pete |date=July 15, 1992 |work= [[Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel]] }}</ref>

Da Yooper's tourist trap not only contains merchandise, but two museums as well. The first museum is a mineral museum that contains various minerals found in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. It also has exhibits related to the local mining culture. This museum is found inside of Da Yooper's Tourist Trap. The other museum is an outdoor museum that is more oriented towards humor. It contains such things as a large chainsaw, called Big Gus, a large rifle, called Big Ernie, and Da Two-holer (a very special outhouse). This comical museum has various other displays in which tourists are encouraged to see in order to understand the humor of the Yooper culture.
