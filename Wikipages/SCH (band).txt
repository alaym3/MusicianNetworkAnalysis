'''SCH''' (an abbreviation for "[[Schizophrenia]]") is the musical and artistic project and band (or rather the ''band-[[Alter ego|alterego]]'')<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www428.pair.com/skenders/recenzijeen.html#SestanBH |title=Samir Šestan: Melancholic Optimism or Black Sun on the Horizon (BH DANI, SARAJEVO, MARCH 2006) |publisher=28.pair.com |accessdate=2011-12-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310210652/http://www428.pair.com/skenders/recenzijeen.html#SestanBH |archivedate=2009-03-10 }}</ref> of '''[[Senad Hadžimusić Teno|Senad Hadžimusić]]''', who is better known by his nickname ''[[Senad Hadžimusić Teno|Teno]]''. Formed in the early-eighties in [[Sarajevo]], the band has had an intensive creative and live existence. SCH represents one of the most significant names in the field of [[alternative rock]] music in the [[former Yugoslavia]]. ''Radio Student Ljubljana's'' Igor Bašin has noted: "As Ljubljana's got [[Laibach (band)|Laibach]] and Belgrade's got [[Ekatarina Velika|EKV]] and [[Disciplina Kičme]] alias [[Šarlo Akrobata]], thus Sarajevo's got SCH. SCH is the key-name of the Sarajevo Alternative Scene."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiostudent.si/article.php?sid=762 |title=Igor Bašin.

Bosnian writer [[Miljenko Jergović]] once described SCH as "...a group of Sarajevan alternative maniacs who have, infinitely and into infinity, dissipated more wild energy and artificial rebellion than one could fit into all the gothic underground cellars from Hamburg to London."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www428.pair.com/skenders/biodataen.html |title=SCH Intro |publisher=28.pair.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17}}</ref>

==SCH Music==
SCH's constantly changing, radically unconventional and experimental music is sometimes cursorily referred as "a mix of [[Laibach (band)|Laibach]], [[Electronic dance music|modern dance electronica]], [[punk rock|punk]] edge and [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnian]] [[folklore]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/thewire/message/16051 |title=Luka Zagoričnik: Radio Študent update (Oct 6, 2002) |publisher=Launch.groups.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-17}}</ref>

A number of reviewers have commented on the precise, determined, and [[Industrial rock|industrial]] aspects of their sound and production, shared by German [[Industrial rock|industrial]], [[Noise rock|noise]], and [[Krautrock]] bands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www428.pair.com/skenders/recenzijeen.html |title=SCH Reviews |publisher=28.pair.com |accessdate=2011-12-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310210652/http://www428.pair.com/skenders/recenzijeen.html |archivedate=2009-03-10 }}</ref> Eldin Hadžović notes in [[BH Dani]], "Noise has been a common denominator in the band's 20-year-old work, during which numerous line-ups have styles came and went, together with high and lows (the latter principally being a long production/performing pause)... SCH has not deviated one inch from its principal task - to serve as a mirror to our reality, seen through the prism of schizophrenia... SCH sounds like nothing that came before them, or anything that may come after they’ve gone."<ref>[http://www428.pair.com/skenders/recenzijeen.html#Krauts Eldin Hadžović: 2006, The Krauts Strike Back ([[BH Dani]], no. 470, 16 June 2006)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310210652/http://www428.pair.com/skenders/recenzijeen.html |date=10 March 2009 }}</ref>

===Milestones and influences===

* In its earliest phase (1983–1984), SCH's music was mixture of [[New wave music|new wave]], [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelia]]. Early influences included [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]], [[Brian Eno]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[Captain Beefheart]], [[Patti Smith]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[King Crimson]].<ref name="autogenerated2003">[http://www428.pair.com/skenders/interviewsCDR.html SCH Interview, December 2003] (translation of the Carpe Diem Records page at [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/carpe_diem_records/sch.htm&date=2009-10-25+17:00:37])</ref>
* SCH's second phase began in early 1985, continuing from an emphasis on recording and performance to a study of war, which became a theme in ''prior to'' and throughout the [[Yugoslav wars]]. This period (1985–1991) was characterized by radicalization of the band's sound and its shifting from post-[[New wave music|new wave]] into [[Noise rock|harsh noise]] and [[Industrial rock|industrial]]. Influences during this period included [[Swans (band)|Swans]], [[Sonic Youth]], [[Throbbing Gristle]], [[SPK (band)|SPK]], [[Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft|D.A.F.]] and early [[Einstürzende Neubauten]].<ref name="autogenerated2003"/>
* SCH continued to perform and record during the [[Siege of Sarajevo]] (1992–1995), but disbanded for several years thereafter, following a 1995 performance in Prague. During the hiatus (1995–2002), [[Senad Hadžimusić Teno|Teno]] published a book of SCH lyrics<ref>{{cite book

</ref> as well as ''[[During Wartime... Again!]]''.<ref name="autogenerated2003"/>

* [[VRIL (album)|''VRIL'']] (2002) marked a new and still actual phase in the band's development, in which electronic instrumentation and sampling have largely replaced its former, "classic" line-up of guitar, bass and drums.<ref name="autogenerated2003"/>

==Live line-up==
As of 2007, SCH live consists of '''Senad Hadžimusić Teno''' on vocals/guitars/synths; [[Rida Attarashany]] on synths/rhythm machine.
