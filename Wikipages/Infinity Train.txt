The series is set on a gigantic, mysterious and seemingly endless train traveling through a barren landscape, whose cars contain a variety of bizarre, fantastical and impossible environments. Passengers on the train proceed from car to car by completing challenges which help them resolve their psychological trauma and emotional issues. Every season of ''Infinity Train'' (referred to as a "Book", each with its own separate subtitle) follows its own storyline and set of characters, although some characters appear across multiple seasons.

All four seasons of ''Infinity Train'' have received critical acclaim for their complex themes and characters, writing, uniqueness, visual animation style, and voice acting. In August 2020, Dennis stated that, although he wanted to continue the series for a total of eight seasons, most of the crew had been laid off and the series was at risk of not being renewed for a fifth season; Dennis suggested that HBO Max might be concerned that the series' stories and themes were too dark and unappealing to children.<ref name="GizmodoFutureJeopardy" /><ref name="HITCRenewalS4" /><ref name="PolygonShowsPotential" /> Promotional material for the fourth season refers to it as the final season of ''Infinity Train''.<ref name="Book 4 WM PR">{{Cite press release|date=February 17, 2021|title=WarnerMedia Expands Kids & Family Offerings on Cartoon Network and HBO Max Under New Tagline Redraw Your World|url=https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/warnermedia-expands-kids-family-offerings-cartoon-network-and-hbo-max-under-new?language_content_entity=en&fb|url-status=live|access-date=February 17, 2021|website=|publisher=[[WarnerMedia]]|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210217181729/https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/warnermedia-expands-kids-family-offerings-cartoon-network-and-hbo-max-under-new?language_content_entity=en|archive-date=February 17, 2021}}</ref>

==Synopsis==
The series is set on a seemingly endless train traveling through a barren landscape; the cars of the train contain a variety of bizarre and fantastical environments. The passengers on the train are people it picks up who have unresolved emotional issues or trauma. As they travel through the train's cars, their adventures inside them give them the opportunity to confront and resolve their emotional problems, represented by a glowing number on their hand that goes down as they confront these issues. Once they resolve their issues and their number reaches zero, a portal opens and they are able to leave the train and return home.

The first season focuses on [[Tulip Olsen]], a girl struggling with her parents' recent divorce. She is accompanied by a small, confused robot named "One-One", and Atticus, the ruler of a kingdom of talking [[corgi]]s. She eventually uncovers many of the train's secrets and confronts Amelia, a passenger who, instead of resolving her trauma from her husband's death, has usurped the role of Conductor from One-One and tried to take control of the train. Before leaving the train, Tulip persuades Amelia to try to adapt to the changes in her life.

In one first-season episode, Tulip frees her own reflection from the mirror world, and the two part ways. The second season focuses on the emancipated [[Lake (Infinity Train)|Mirror Tulip ("MT")]], now on the run from enforcers attempting to execute her as punishment for abandoning her role as Tulip's reflection. She teams up with Jesse, a new train passenger, as well as Alan Dracula, a silent deer with a variety of powers. She helps Jesse leave the train by helping him learn to stand up for himself, and he returns to the train to help her escape to the outside world, as well.

The third season centers on [[Grace Monroe|Grace]] and Simon, the leaders of a cult of rogue passengers who vandalize the train and assault its denizens to keep their numbers high. Their travels with a young girl named Hazel and her gorilla friend, Tuba, make Grace more sympathetic to the train's denizens. After Simon kills Tuba, it is revealed that Hazel herself is one of Amelia's creations, and Grace realizes what she thought she knew about the train is wrong. After fighting off Simon's attempt to usurp control, Grace begins facing up to and mending her mistakes.

Set decades earlier, during the period while Amelia is establishing control over the train, the fourth season centers on Ryan and Min-Gi, two best friends who want to become famous musicians. Their relationship is strained due to Ryan's brashness and Min-Gi's fear of the future. While on the train, they meet a talking [[Call bell|service bell]] named Kez who has trouble owning up to her mistakes. Ryan and Min-Gi come to realize that they need each other in order for them to move forward in life, while Kez finally apologizes to other train denizens she harmed.

* [[Tulip Olsen]] ([[Ashley Johnson (actress)|Ashley Johnson]]) – A 13-year-old girl struggling with her parents' divorce who finds herself trapped on the train when trying to get to a game-design camp. She is analytical, down-to-earth, and determined to get off the train.
** Naomi Hansen and Lily Sanfelippo voice younger versions of Tulip, respectively at age 5 and from age 6 to 8.
* One-One – A spherical robot consisting of two separate hemisphere-shaped robots, formerly collectively known simply as One. In ''Book 1'', One-One accompanies Tulip on her journey, and eventually learns that it is the rightful Conductor of the train. At the end of ''Book 1'', One-One resumes its duties as Conductor, overseeing the operations of the train and passengers. Throughout the background of ''Book 4'', set in 1986, One bonds with Amelia, loosening restrictions on the passengers, before she usurps his position as the Conductor.
** Glad-One (Jeremy Crutchley) – The exuberant and optimistic part of One-One.
** Sad-One ([[Owen Dennis]]) – The morose and pessimistic part of One-One.
* Atticus ([[Ernie Hudson]]) – A talking [[Welsh Corgi|Corgi]] and the king of Corginia, one of the train cars. He accompanies Tulip on her journey.

====Book 2 – ''Cracked Reflection''====

At the start of ''Book 2'', she has been living on the train as a fugitive from the reflection police. She accompanies Jesse on his journey through the train while struggling with her sense of identity as an independent person, rather than Tulip's reflection or a construct of the train. Upon leaving the train at the end of Book 2, she names herself Lake.
* Jesse Cosay ([[Robbie Daymond]]) – A passenger who becomes MT's friend and helps her escape the train. He is easygoing and friendly, but has a hard time resisting [[peer pressure]]; his experience on the train teaches him how to stand up for his friends and his younger brother. Upon initially leaving the train in the middle of Book 2, he returns in order to help MT leave too.
* Alan Dracula – A magical [[shapeshifting]] [[white-tailed deer]], a denizen of the train who accompanies MT and Jesse.

====Book 3 – ''Cult of the Conductor''====
* [[Grace Monroe]] ([[Kirby Howell-Baptiste]]) – The young adult leader of the Apex, a gang of passengers who aim to raise their numbers to remain on the train indefinitely, and believe One-One to be an impostor who usurped the role of Conductor.

** Brooke Singleton voices Grace as a child
* Simon Laurent ([[Kyle McCarley]]) – Grace's second-in-command and best friend, who first appears alongside her in ''Book 2''. Although the two are very close, they gradually drift apart during ''Book 3'', due to Simon's unwillingness to acknowledge his mistakes and learn from them.
** Samuel Faraci voices Simon as a child
* Hazel (Isabella Abiera) – A 6-year-old girl who travels the train. Although she has a number on her hand, it does not glow; unknown to her, she is actually a denizen of the train created by Amelia's experiments.
* Tuba ([[Diane Delano]]) – Hazel's gorilla friend and protector, a denizen of the train.

====Book 4 – ''Duet''====
* Min-Gi Park (Johnny Young) – A young man who is hesitant to pursue his dreams of being a musician and feels pressured to live a conventional life instead.
* Ryan Akagi (Sekai Murashige) – Min-Gi's best friend, who aspires to become a famous musician and tends to make rash decisions.

==Production history==
===Conception and influences===
Prior to creating ''Infinity Train'', [[Owen Dennis]] worked as a storyboard artist on ''[[Regular Show]].'' Dennis conceived ''Infinity Train'' in 2010, originally as a film. He was inspired by "the feeling of waking up in an unsettling space" which he felt while on a return flight to the U.S. from China. Claiming when he had "woken up. I looked around, and there were a bunch of people staring into screens in the dark in this quiet room. I thought this was kind of creepy. And it sort of started from there."<ref name="'Infinity Train' tackles issues">{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2019-08-08/infinity-train-owen-dennis | title='Infinity Train' tackles issues many kids shows avoid.

===Development===
''Infinity Train'' has three staff writers, who make up the main story team in addition to showrunner Dennis and supervising producer/director Maddie Queripel. [[Cole Sanchez]] served on the story team for Book 1's development but departed to work as supervising producer on ''[[Summer Camp Island]]''. The process on each episode was that a writer would make an outline, an expansion of the outline, a script, and then would send it to a team of two board artists. The 'boarders' would have 5 weeks to make thumbnails, then the full boards, and then clean them up, before it would be sent away for animation. The animation is done by [[Sunmin Image Pictures]] in Seoul, South Korea using [[traditional animation]] methods.<ref>{{Cite web|last=LTD|first=SMIP CO|title=SMIP.

On August 16, 2020, while ''Infinity Train'' Book 3 was releasing on HBO Max, Dennis reported that though the team had plans for more seasons, the whole crew and most of the production staff had been laid off, and the possibility of a series renewal depended on the series' viewership on HBO Max.<ref>{{cite tweet |author=Owen Dennis |user=OweeeeenDennis |number=1295137670499168256 |date=August 16, 2020 |title=And we can make more, *IF* we get the views.

When asked how many more seasons of ''Infinity Train'' were planned, Dennis stated "We have rough ideas for themes and which characters we'd like to follow for five more seasons, up to season eight.

Dennis expressed interest in doing ''Infinity Train'' comic books that "are in canon and could be written by or starring non-Americans."<ref name="Future Is in Jeopardy"/><ref name="video game"/> Dennis said that there were plans to make an ''Infinity Train'' video game, and there was an ''Infinity Train'' [[Virtual reality game|VR]] experience "where you hung out and solved puzzles in Corginia."

In a [[Reddit AMA]] on April 16, 2021, the day after Book 4's release, Dennis confirmed that Book 5 would have been the aforementioned Amelia-focused movie, and although a full script had been written, Cartoon Network Studios passed it on because they didn't think it had a "child entry point."<ref>{{citation |quote=We wrote an ''Infinity Train'' movie.

Darren Franich of ''Entertainment Weekly'' still hailed it as "a solid season of television."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Franich |first1=Darren |title=Infinity Train is your next great discovery: Review |url=https://ew.com/tv/tv-reviews/infinity-train-is-your-next-great-discovery/ |website=Entertainment Weekly |access-date=19 June 2021}}</ref> James Poniewozik of ''The New York Times'' agreed that the ending was bittersweet with the knowledge that the series was ending before the creative team had planned, but praised its humor and characters.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Poniewozik |first1=James |title=The Strange, Lovely ‘Infinity Train’ Reaches the End of the Line |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/arts/television/infinity-train-final-season.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=19 June 2021}}</ref>
