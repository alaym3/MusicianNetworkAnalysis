'''Alfred Matthew''' "'''Weird Al'''" '''Yankovic''' ({{IPAc-en|'|j|æ|ŋ|k|ə|v|ɪ|k}} {{respell|YANG|kə|vik}};<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/nls/about/organization/standards-guidelines/yz/#y|title=Say How: Y|publisher=National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped|access-date=July 24, 2018}}</ref> born October 23, 1959) is an American singer, musician, record producer, and actor who is known for [[Comedy music|humorous songs]] that make light of [[popular culture|pop culture]] and often parody specific songs by contemporary musical acts. He also performs original songs that are style [[pastiche]]s of the work of other acts, as well as [[polka]] medleys of several popular songs, most of which feature his trademark [[accordion]].

Since having a comedy song aired in 1976, Yankovic has sold more than 12 million albums ({{as of|2007|lc=y}}),<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/09/AR2007080900305.html |last=Harrington |first=Richard |title=Weird Al's Imitation: A Funky Form of Flattery |work=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=August 10, 2007 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5kESmJdXg?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/09/AR2007080900305.html |archive-date=October 2, 2009 |url-status=live |date=August 10, 2007 }}</ref> recorded more than 150 parodies and original songs,<ref name="catchup">{{cite web|url=http://ninemsn.video.msn.com/v/en-au/v.htm?f=39&g=b738d4f6-1921-4e6f-9836-1ce2b2b0850c&p=autvshows_authecatchup&t=m2556&mediaid=77139 |title=Weird Al Yankovic's latest send-ups on The Catch-up|access-date=March 14, 2007|archive-date=September 22, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922002829/http://ninemsn.video.msn.com/v/en-au/v.htm?f=39&g=b738d4f6-1921-4e6f-9836-1ce2b2b0850c&p=autvshows_authecatchup&t=m2556&mediaid=77139}}</ref><ref name="catalog">{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/catalog.htm |title=Weird Al Yankovic: Catalog |access-date=October 28, 2006 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5kESmp2r0?url=http://www.weirdal.com/catalog.htm |archive-date=October 2, 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/bio.htm| title=Weird Al Yankovic: Biographies|access-date=October 28, 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061110025903/http://weirdal.com/bio.htm| archive-date= November 10, 2006}}</ref> and performed more than 1,000 live shows.<ref name="livepage">{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/livepage.htm |title=Weird Al Yankovic: Live Performances|access-date=November 10, 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061113132038/http://weirdal.com/livepage.htm| archive-date= November 13, 2006}}</ref> His work has earned him five [[Grammy Award]]s and a further 11 nominations, four [[RIAA certification|gold records]], and six [[RIAA certification|platinum records]] in the U.S. His first top ten ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' album (''[[Straight Outta Lynwood]]'') and single ("[[White & Nerdy]]") were both released in 2006, nearly three decades into his career. His latest album, ''[[Mandatory Fun]]'' (2014), became his first No. 1 album during its debut week.

Yankovic's success comes in part from his effective use of music videos to further parody pop culture, the song's original artist, and the original music videos themselves, scene-for-scene in some cases. He directed later videos himself and went on to direct for other artists, including [[Ben Folds]], [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]], [[the Black Crowes]], and [[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|the Presidents of the United States of America]]. With the decline of music television and the onset of social media, he used YouTube and other video sites to publish his videos; this strategy helped to boost sales of his later albums. He has stated that he may forgo traditional albums in favor of timely releases of singles from the 2010s onwards.

In addition to recording his albums, Yankovic wrote and starred in the film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' (1989) and the television series ''[[The Weird Al Show]]'' (1997). He has also made guest appearances and performed voice acting roles on many television shows and video web content, in addition to starring in ''[[Al TV]]'' specials on [[MTV]].<ref name=allmusic>{{cite news|last=Ankeny |first=Jason |title=Weird Al Yankovic Biography |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/weird-al-yankovic-mn0000817315/biography |publisher=[[AllMusic.com]] ([[Rovi]]) |access-date=July 24, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6aGZzJGWM?url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/weird-al-yankovic-mn0000817315/biography |archive-date=July 24, 2015 |url-status=live  }}</ref> He has also written two children's books, ''When I Grow Up'' (2011) and ''My New Teacher and Me!''

== Career ==
=== 1976–1981: Dr. Demento and early fame ===
Yankovic received his first exposure via syndicated comedy radio personality [[Dr. Demento]]'s Southern California-based radio show, saying "If there hadn't been a Dr. Demento, I'd probably have a real job now."<ref>{{cite news|title=Dr. Demento Marks 30 Years Of Funny Music|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/us/new-york/syracuse/syracuse-post-standard/2000/03-01/page-36|first=Jim|last=Bessman|agency=BPI Entertainment}}</ref> Despite his mother having caught Yankovic listening to Dr. Demento's program and banning him from listening to it again in the future, he found ways to hear it discreetly.<ref name="nytimes apr2020"/> In 1976, Dr. Demento spoke at Yankovic's school where the then-16-year-old Yankovic gave him a homemade [[Compact Cassette|tape]] of original and parody songs performed on the accordion in Yankovic's bedroom into a "cheesy little tape recorder". The tape's first song, "Belvedere Cruisin'" – about his family's [[Plymouth Belvedere#1962–1964|Plymouth Belvedere]] – was played on Demento's comedy radio show, launching Yankovic's career. Demento said, "'Belvedere Cruising' might not have been the very best song I ever heard, but it had some clever lines [...] I put the tape on the air immediately."<ref name="booklet"/><ref name="unlabeled tape">{{cite web |url=http://weirdal.com/rare89.htm |title="Weird Al" Yankovic: Rare Items: UNLABELED TAPE |access-date=August 24, 2006 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5fkODSx8I?url=http://weirdal.com/rare89.htm |archive-date=April 3, 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Yankovic also played at local coffeehouses, accompanied by fellow dorm resident Joel Miller on bongos.<ref name="wapost feb2017">{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/style/2017/02/16/how-weird-al-eclipsed-almost-every-star-he-ever-parodied/ | title = Was 'Weird Al' the real star all along? | first = Geoff | last = Edgars | date = February 16, 2017 | access-date = November 16, 2017 | work = [[The Washington Post]] }}</ref> Yankovic said:

During Yankovic's second year as an architecture student at Cal Poly, he became a disc jockey at [[KCPR]], the university's radio station. Yankovic had been called "Weird Al" originally as a more derogatory nickname from others within the dormitory he shared, as he was seen as the strange outcast compared to other residents.<ref name="nytimes apr2020"/> Though he initially took it as an insult, Yankovic eventually "took it on professionally" as his persona for the station.<ref name="booklet"/> In 1978, he released his first recording (as Alfred Yankovic), "Take Me Down", on the LP, ''Slo Grown'', as a benefit for the Economic Opportunity Commission of [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo County]]. The song mocked famous nearby landmarks such as [[Bubblegum Alley]] and the fountain toilets at the [[Madonna Inn]].

In mid-1979, shortly before his senior year, "[[My Sharona]]" by [[The Knack]] was on the charts and Yankovic took his accordion into the restroom across the hall from the radio station to take advantage of the [[echo chamber]] acoustics and recorded a parody titled "[[My Bologna]]".<ref name= takingoff/> He sent it to Dr. Demento, who played it to good response from listeners. Yankovic met The Knack after a show at his college and introduced himself as the author of "My Bologna". The Knack's lead singer, [[Doug Fieger]], said he liked the song and suggested that [[Capitol Records]] vice president [[Rupert Perry]] release it as a single.<ref name="booklet"/> "My Bologna" was released as a single with "School Cafeteria" as its B-side, and the label gave Yankovic a six-month recording contract. Yankovic, who was "only getting average grades" in his architecture degree, began to realize that he might make a career of comedic music.<ref name="booklet"/>

On September 14, 1980, Yankovic was a guest on the ''Dr. Demento Show'', where he was to record a new parody live. The song was called "[[Another One Rides the Bus]]", a parody of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s hit, "[[Another One Bites the Dust]]". While practicing the song outside the sound booth, he met [[Jon Schwartz (drummer)|Jon "Bermuda" Schwartz]], who told him he was a drummer and agreed to bang on Yankovic's accordion case to help Yankovic keep a steady beat during the song. They rehearsed the song just a few times before the show began.<ref name="booklet"/> "Another One Rides the Bus" became so popular that Yankovic's first television appearance was a performance of the song on ''[[The Tomorrow Show]]'' with [[Tom Snyder]] on April 21, 1981.<ref>{{cite document |title=TV Listings, Tuesday, April 21 |work=The Baltimore Sun |date=April 19, 1981 |page=TV24 |id={{ProQuest|535950110}} }}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet | number = 1385052648668221444 | user = alyankovic | title = Tonight marks the 40th anniversary... | first = "Weird Al" | last = Yankovic | author-link = "Weird Al" Yankovic | date = April 21, 2021 | accessdate = April 22, 2021 }}</ref> On the show, Yankovic played his accordion, and again, Schwartz banged on the accordion case and provided comical sound effects. Yankovic's record label, [[TK Records]], went bankrupt about two weeks after the single was released, so Yankovic received no royalties from its initial release.<ref name=takingoff>{{cite news |last=Harrington |first=Richard |title='Weird Al' Taking Off |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=May 19, 1983 |page=C8 |id={{ProQuest|147567013}} }}</ref>

=== 1981–1989: Band and fame ===
[[File:Weirdalclassic.jpg|thumb|Yankovic's "classic" look before eye surgery: with glasses, mustache and short, curly hair; used from 1979 to 1998]]
1981 brought Yankovic on tour for the first time as part of Dr. Demento's stage show. His stage act in a [[Phoenix, Arizona]], nightclub caught the eye of manager Jay Levey, who was "blown away".<ref name="booklet"/> Levey asked Yankovic if he had considered creating a full band and doing his music as a career. Yankovic admitted that he had, so Levey held auditions. [[Steve Jay]] became Yankovic's bass player, and Jay's friend [[Jim West (guitarist)|Jim West]] played guitar. Schwartz continued on drums. Yankovic's first show with his new band was on March 31, 1982.<ref name="livepage"/> Several days later, Yankovic and his band were the opening act for [[Missing Persons (band)|Missing Persons]].

Yankovic recorded "[[I Love Rocky Road]]", (a parody of "[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]" originally recorded by [[Arrows (British band)|The Arrows]]) which was produced by [[Rick Derringer]], in 1982. The song was a hit on Top 40 radio, leading to Yankovic's signing with [[Scotti Brothers Records]]. In 1983, Yankovic's first [["Weird Al" Yankovic (album)|self-titled album]] was released on Scotti Bros. The song "[[Ricky (song)|Ricky]]" was released as a single and the music video received exposure on the still-young [[MTV]]. "Ricky" broke the top 100 videos on MTV at the time, which Yankovic took as a sign that his career was in music, quitting his job as a mailroom clerk at the local offices of [[Westwood One (1976-2011)|Westwood One]] to pursue the music career.<ref name="wapost feb2017"/>

Yankovic released his second album ''[["Weird Al" Yankovic in 3-D]]'' in 1984. The first single "[[Eat It]]", a parody of the [[Michael Jackson]] song "[[Beat It]]", became popular, thanks in part to the music video, a shot-for-shot parody of Jackson's "Beat It" music video, and what Yankovic sarcastically described as his "uncanny resemblance" to Jackson. "Eat It" was also aided by the first of Yankovic's ''[[Al TV]]'' specials that aired on [[MTV]] on April 1, 1984, the network looking to Yankovic's rising popularity to help fill its programming time.<ref name="nytimes apr2020"/> Peaking at No. 12 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] on April 14, 1984,<ref>{{cite web |title=Eat It – Weird Al Yankovic |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=weird al yankovic|chart=all}} |work=Billboard}}</ref> "Eat It" remained Yankovic's highest-charting single until "[[White & Nerdy]]" placed at No. 9 in October 2006.<ref>{{cite news |title=White & Nerdy |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=weird al yankovic|chart=all}} |work=Billboard}}</ref> In Canada, "Eat It" reached No. 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/028020/f2/nlc008388.6319.pdf| title=RPM Top 100 Singles - April 14, 1984}}</ref>

In 1985, Yankovic co-wrote and starred in a [[mockumentary]] of his own life titled ''[[The Compleat Al]]'' (the title being a parody of the 1982 documentary ''[[The Compleat Beatles]]''), which intertwined the facts of his life up to that point with fiction. The movie also featured some clips from Yankovic's trip to Japan and some clips from the ''Al TV'' specials. ''The Compleat Al'' was co-directed by Jay Levey, who would direct ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' four years later. Also released around the same time as ''The Compleat Al'' was ''The Authorized Al'', a biographical book based on the film. The book, resembling a scrapbook, included real and fictional humorous photographs and documents.

Yankovic and his band toured as the opening act for [[The Monkees]] in mid-1987 for their second reunion tour of North America. Yankovic claims to have enjoyed touring with The Monkees, even though "the promoter gypped us out of a bunch of money".<ref>{{cite web |title='Ask Al' Q&As for November, 1998 |url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#1198 |access-date=June 5, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070609200738/http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#top |archive-date=June 9, 2007}}</ref>

In 1988 Yankovic was the narrator on the [[Wendy Carlos]] recording of [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]''.<ref>Steve Johnson, [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-07-25/features/8902200286_1_ex-police-sting-tune/2 "Weirdly Normal: Pop-tune Buster Al Yankovic Saves Worst Wackiness For The Screen"], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', July 25, 1989.</ref> The album also included a sequel to [[Camille Saint-Saëns]]'s composition ''[[The Carnival of the Animals]]'' titled "The Carnival of the Animals Part II", with Yankovic providing humorous poems for each of the featured creatures in the style of [[Ogden Nash]], who had written humorous poems for the original.

Yankovic's success led to a deal to make his film ''UHF'', which premiered in July 1989. While the film had since become a cult title, its initial release was against mediocre reviews, and it was up against several other summer blockbusters, including ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'', ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', and ''[[Licence to Kill]]''. While Yankovic released an associated soundtrack album, ''[[UHF – Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and Other Stuff]]'', it was not as successful as his previous albums. Yankovic fell into a slump over the next three years as a result of the poor performance of the film.<ref name="avclub">{{cite web | url = https://www.avclub.com/article/we-got-it-all-uhf-oral-history-weird-al-yankovics--215579 | title = We got it all on UHF: An oral history of "Weird Al" Yankovic's cult classic | first= Sean | last = O'Neil | date = March 23, 2015 | access-date = March 23, 2015 | publisher = [[The A.V.

===1990–1997: Revived career===
Yankovic had returned to the studio to prepare songs for his next album ''[[Off the Deep End]]'' around 1990. During production, [[Rubén Valtierra]] joined the band on keyboards in 1991, allowing Yankovic to concentrate more on singing and increasing his use of the stage space during concerts. Further, Yankovic took over production from [[Rick Derringer]] in 1992. While Derringer had produced six of Yankovic's previous albums, for which he won two [[Grammy Awards]], Derringer's drug-related issues had become an issue, along with Yankovic's more complex musical scores (involving horns and other instruments).<ref name="wapost feb2017"/>

By 1992, most of the original songs for ''Off the Deep End'' were complete, but Yankovic still did not have a strong parody and was waiting for the next big hit to work from, as he was still in a slump post-''UHF''. When Jackson released his next album, ''[[Dangerous (Michael Jackson album)|Dangerous]]'', and its hit single "[[Black or White]]", Yankovic had quickly written a parody, "Snack All Night", from it, and hoped Jackson would allow him to use the parody. Jackson denied Yankovic this, as Jackson felt "Black or White" carried a serious message that would be undermined by the parody.<ref name="drdinterview">{{cite interview | last = Yankovic | first = "Weird Al" | interviewer = Dr. Demento | title=The Dr. Demento Show|url = http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/interviews/otde.txt | year = 1992 | access-date = June 26, 2010 }}</ref> Again, Yankovic fell into a mood and delayed release of ''Off the Deep End'' without a lead parody. Around this time, [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and the grunge music scene began to take off. Yankovic wrote a parody of Nirvana's hit "[[Smells like Teen Spirit]]", "[[Smells Like Nirvana]]", and was able to secure the band's permission for the parody; Nirvana's lead singer [[Kurt Cobain]] was said that getting Yankovic to parody their work was a sign their band had "made it".<ref name="spin 20th">{{cite web | url = https://www.spin.com/2012/10/weird-al-yankovic-looks-back-at-20-years-of-smells-like-nirvana/ | title = 'Weird Al' Yankovic Looks Back at 20 Years of 'Smells Like Nirvana' | work = [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |publisher=[[Buzzmedia]] | first = Christopher R. | last = Weingarten | date = October 11, 2012 | access-date = October 11, 2012 }}</ref> "Smells Like Nirvana" became the lead song on ''Off the Deep End'', landing at #35 on the Billboard charts, his second top 40 hit in the United States. ''Off the Deep End'' reached #17 on the Billboard 200, and helped to revitalize Yankovic's career after the failure of ''UHF''.

Yankovic's next two studio albums were modest successes in light of ''Off the Deep End''. ''[[Alapalooza]]'' was released in 1993, and led with "[[Jurassic Park (song)|Jurassic Park]]", a spoof of "[[MacArthur Park (song)|MacArthur Park]]" by [[Richard Harris]] while mocking the [[Jurassic Park (film)|1993 film of the same name]]. ''Alapalooza'' peaked at #46 on the Billboard 200. ''[[Bad Hair Day]]'' in 1996 headlined with "[[Amish Paradise]]", a parody of [[Coolio]]'s "[[Gangsta's Paradise]]". "Amish Paradise" reached #53 on the top Billboard 100 singles, while the album reached #14 on the Billboard 200, and eventually was certified Double Platinum in sales by RIAA, making it one of Yankovic's more successful works.

In addition, Yankovic released a number of compilation works during this period, including ''[[Permanent Record: Al in the Box]]'', a four-CD collection which included most of Yankovic's previous works as well as an informational booklet with contributions from Dr. Demento. Other compilations included ''[[Greatest Hits Volume II ("Weird Al" Yankovic album)|Greatest Hits Volume II]]'', a collection of songs that were not included in ''Permanent Record'', and ''[[The TV Album]]'', featuring songs loosely based on television shows.

=== 1998–present: New look and later career ===

On January 24, 1998, Yankovic had [[LASIK]] eye surgery to correct his extreme [[myopia]].<ref>{{cite web |title=LASIK story and pictures |url=http://weirdal.com/thelook1.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025050146/http://www.weirdal.com/thelook1.htm |archive-date=October 25, 2007 }}</ref> When ''[[Running with Scissors ("Weird Al" Yankovic album)|Running with Scissors]]'' debuted in 1999, he unveiled a radically changed look. In addition to shedding his glasses, he had shaved off his moustache and grown out his hair. He had previously shaved his moustache in 1983 for the video of "[[Ricky (song)|Ricky]]" to resemble [[Desi Arnaz]], in 1989 for segments of the "[[UHF (song)|UHF]]" music video, and in 1996 for the "Amish Paradise" video. Yankovic reasoned, "If [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s allowed to reinvent herself every 15&nbsp;minutes, I figure I should be good for a change at least once every 20 years."<ref>{{cite web |title=Archive.org for www.weirdal.com/bio.htm for February 8, 2001 |url=http://www.weirdal.com/bio.htm |access-date=October 29, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010208173222/http://www.weirdal.com/bio.htm |archive-date=February 8, 2001}}</ref> He parodied the reaction to this "new look" in a commercial for his nonexistent ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' special. The commercial featured Yankovic in the short-haired wig from the music video for [[Hanson (band)|Hanson's]] "River", claiming his new look was an attempt to "get back to the core of what I'm all about", that being "the music".<ref>{{cite web |title='Weird Al' Yankovic MTV Unplugged Promo |url=http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/videos/EatItUnpluggedPromo.wmv |access-date=October 28, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929075952/http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/videos/EatItUnpluggedPromo.wmv |archive-date=September 29, 2006}}</ref>

''Running with Scissors'' was followed by his next studio album ''[[Poodle Hat]]'' in 2003. ''Poodle Hat'' was met with average reviews without any standout singles, though the album did peak at number 17 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Yankovic's following album was ''[[Straight Outta Lynwood]]'' in 2006, which featured the single "White & Nerdy", a parody of "[[Ridin']]" by [[Chamillionaire]]. "White & Nerdy" became Yankovic's first Billboard Hot 100 single, debuting at #29 and peaking at #9. "[[Canadian Idiot]]", a parody of "[[American Idiot (song)|American Idiot]]" by [[Green Day]], also charted in the Hot 100. The album as a whole reached #10 in the Billboard 200, and by 2008 was Yankovic's first [[certified platinum]] album, having reached over one million sales.

Following ''Straight Out of Lynwood'', Yankovic started to explore [[digital distribution]] of his songs. On October 7, 2008, Yankovic released to the [[iTunes Store]] "[[Whatever You Like ("Weird Al" Yankovic song)|Whatever You Like]]", a parody of the [[T.I.]] [[Whatever You Like|song of the same title]], which Yankovic said he had come up with two weeks before. Yankovic said that the benefit of digital distribution is that "I don't have to wait around while my songs get old and dated—I can get them out on the Internet almost immediately."<ref>{{cite web |last=Vreval |first=Jeff |title=Weird Al Goes Digital With T.I.

Yankovic had reported an interest in parodying [[Lady Gaga]]'s material,<ref name="bb">{{cite news |first=Gary |last=Graff |title=Weird Al May Parody Lady Gaga On Next Album |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/957666/weird-al-may-parody-lady-gaga-on-next-album |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=June 22, 2010 |access-date=September 13, 2010 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100828222609/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/957666/weird-al-may-parody-lady-gaga-on-next-album| archive-date= August 28, 2010}}</ref> and on April 20 announced that he had written and recorded a parody of "[[Born This Way (song)|Born This Way]]" titled "[[Perform This Way]]", to be the lead single for his new album. However, upon first submitting it to Lady Gaga's manager for approval (which Yankovic does as a courtesy), he was not given permission to release it commercially. As he had previously done under similar circumstances (with his parody of James Blunt's "[[You're Beautiful]]", which was titled "[[You're Pitiful]]"), Yankovic then released the song for free on the internet. Soon afterwards, Gaga's manager admitted that he had denied the parody of his own accord without forwarding the song to his client, and upon seeing it online, Lady Gaga granted permission for the parody. Yankovic has stated that all of his proceeds from the parody and its music video will be donated to the [[Human Rights Campaign]], to support the human rights themes of the original song.<ref name="Gaga Parody Permission">{{cite web|url=http://alyankovic.wordpress.com/the-gaga-saga/ |title=The Gaga Saga |date=April 20, 2011 |access-date=April 20, 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5y61XzOga?url=http://alyankovic.wordpress.com/the-gaga-saga/ |archive-date=April 20, 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref name="Gaga Parody Update">{{cite web |url=http://alyankovic.wordpress.com/2011/04/20/gaga-update/ |title=Gaga Update |date=April 20, 2011 |access-date=April 20, 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110426031039/http://alyankovic.wordpress.com/2011/04/20/gaga-update/| archive-date= April 26, 2011}}</ref> Yankovic was also a judge for the 10th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/pastjudges.asp |title=Past Judges |publisher=Independent Music Awards |access-date=October 26, 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110724134001/http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/pastjudges.asp| archive-date= July 24, 2011}}</ref>

===Parodies===
[[File:Kyle-cassidy-weird-al-yankovic.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Yankovic, photographed by [[Kyle Cassidy]]]]
Yankovic is well known for creating parodies of contemporary radio hits, typically which make up about half of his studio releases. Unlike other parody artists such as [[Allan Sherman]], Yankovic and his band strive to keep the backing music in his parodies the same as the original, transcribing the original song by ear and re-recording the song for the parody.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/weird-al-endures | title = Weird Al Endures | date = July 16, 2014 | access-date = August 8, 2014 | work = [[The New Yorker]] | first = Ian | last = Crouch }}</ref> In some cases, in requesting the original band to allow for his parody, the band will offer to help out with the recreation: [[Dire Straits]] members [[Mark Knopfler]] and [[Guy Fletcher]] perform on "[[Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*]]", Yankovic's parody of [[Dire Straits]]' "[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]", while [[Imagine Dragons]] provided Yankovic with advice on how to recreate some of the electronic sounds they used for "Radioactive" in Yankovic's parody "Inactive".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6157636/weird-al-yankovic-interview-pharrell-mandatory-fun |title='Weird Al' Yankovic On Getting Pharrell's Permission: 'He Could Not Have Been Nicer' |first=Gary |last= Graff |date=July 15, 2014 |access-date=July 15, 2014 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> Yankovic's career in novelty and comedy music has outlasted many of his "mainstream" parody targets, such as [[Toni Basil]], [[MC Hammer]], and [[Men Without Hats]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spokane7.com/music/stories/?ID=401|title=Weird Al's shtick still draws a crowd|access-date=October 16, 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927182156/http://www.spokane7.com/music/stories/?ID=401|archive-date=September 27, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/northofboston/x1575047109|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923200022/http://www.wickedlocal.com/northofboston/x1575047109|archive-date=September 23, 2012|title=Revenge of the nerd: 'Weird Al' gets all white and nerdy for summer tour|access-date=August 13, 2007}}</ref> Yankovic's continued success (including the top 10 single "White & Nerdy" and album ''[[Straight Outta Lynwood]]'' in 2006) has enabled him to escape the one-hit wonder stigma often associated with novelty music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tweak.com/phonetag/weirdal|title=Tweak: Phone Tag – Weird Al Yankovic|access-date=October 16, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509010828/http://www.tweak.com/phonetag/weirdal|archive-date=May 9, 2006}}</ref>

Yankovic considers his body of work to primarily feature parodies, rather than satires of the original song or artist, as he found that satire of songs or artists has already been done before.<ref name="vulture wordcrimes">{{cite web | url = https://www.vulture.com/2017/03/weird-al-on-turning-blurred-lines-into-word-crimes.html | title = Weird Al Yankovic Details Exactly How He Turned 'Blurred Lines' Into 'Word Crimes' | first = Jesse David | last=  Fox | date = March 25, 2017 | access-date = July 24, 2019 | work = [[Vulture (website)|Vulture]] }}</ref> Most Yankovic songs consist of the original song's music, with a separate, unrelated set of amusing lyrics. Yankovic's humor normally lies more in creating unexpected incongruity between an artist's image and the topic of the song, contrasting the style of the song with its content (such as the songs "Amish Paradise", "White & Nerdy", and "You're Pitiful"), or in pointing out trends or works which have become pop culture clichés (such as "[[eBay (song)|eBay]]" and "[[Don't Download This Song]]"). Yankovic's parodies are often satirical of popular culture, including television (''see [[The TV Album]]''), movies ("[[The Saga Begins]]"), and food (''see [[The Food Album]]''). Yankovic claims he has no intention of writing "serious" music. In his reasoning, "There's enough people that do unfunny music. I'll leave the serious stuff to [[Paris Hilton]] and [[Kevin Federline]]."<ref name="hub">{{cite web|url=http://hub.lsj.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070702/NOISE02/707040313/1104/HUB |title='Weird Al' Yankovic – Parodist promises a high-energy show – with costume changes |access-date=July 8, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930020306/http://hub.lsj.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20070702%2FNOISE02%2F707040313%2F1104%2FHUB |archive-date=September 30, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Yankovic considered that his first true satirical song was "Smells Like Nirvana", which references unintelligible lyrics in Nirvana's "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]".<ref name="avclub setlist">{{cite web |url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/weird-al-yankovic,58244 |title="Weird Al" Yankovic |first=Nathan |last=Rabin |date=June 29, 2011 |access-date=June 29, 2011 |publisher=[[The A.V. Club]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5zodtUwdj?url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/weird-al-yankovic,58244/ |archive-date=June 30, 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Other satirical songs include "[[Achy Breaky Song]]", which refers to the song "[[Achy Breaky Heart]]", "(This Song's Just) Six Words Long", which refers to the repetitious lyrics in "[[Got My Mind Set on You]]", and "Perform This Way", set to [[Lady Gaga]]'s "[[Born This Way (song)|Born This Way]]" that drew inspiration from Lady Gaga's outlandish but confident attitude.<ref name="vulture wordcrimes"/>

Yankovic is the sole writer for all his songs and, for "legal and personal reasons", does not accept parody submissions or ideas from fans.<ref name="faq"/> There exists, however, one exception to this rule: [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] was reportedly talking with a friend and happened to wonder aloud when Yankovic was going to turn her "[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]" into "[[Like a Surgeon ("Weird Al" Yankovic song)|Like a Surgeon]]". Madonna's friend was a mutual friend of Yankovic's manager, Jay Levey, and eventually Yankovic himself heard the story from Levey.<ref name="booklet"/> In writing his parodies as well as his original songs, Yankovic spends a great deal of time in deciding the right words that not only match the beat of the original song but that fit theme of the parody. He says that some songs have taken him weeks to compose the lyrics to as he permeates the various choices, sometimes entering a "zombie phase" as he mulls these over in his home. For example, Yankovic believes he could have written a completely different version of "White & Nerdy" based on the alternative choices of lyrics he had come up with and had discarded for the final song. He has also done significant research for other song parodies to get facts and keywords for certain areas of knowledge, such as for "I Think I'm a Clone Now" or hospitals for "Like a Surgeon". Yankovic has documented all these past lyrical attempts, first through binders and then computerized in case he needs to go back for future songs.<ref name="nytimes apr2020"/>

===Polka medleys===
Most of Yankovic's studio albums include a [[polka]] medley of about a dozen contemporary songs at the time of the album, with the choruses or memorable lines of various songs juxtaposed for humorous effect. In Yankovic's early career, before recording his first album, he had performed such polka medleys in live shows in California, though then using songs from lesser-known bands like [[Bad Brains]] and the [[Plasmatics]]. He had been inspired to do so from Spike Jones, who had transitioned classical music into polka.<ref name="avbook book excerpt">{{cite web | url = https://www.avclub.com/exclusive-book-excerpt-weird-al-isnt-just-a-parody-mas-1819695905 | title = Exclusive book excerpt: Weird Al isn't just a parody master | first = Ray | last = Padgett | date = October 25, 2017 | access-date = November 15, 2017 | work = [[The A.V. Club]] }}</ref> Yankovic said that converting these songs to polka was "...the way God intended".<ref name="livedaily 2007"/> Yankovic did not include a medley on his first album, but considered this for his second, ''In 3-D'', recognizing that it would only work if he used well-known songs. The resulting "Polkas on 45", which featured songs from [[Devo]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Berlin (band)|Berlin]], and [[The Beatles]], was popular, and the polka medley became a staple of all but one of Yankovic's future albums.<ref name="avbook book excerpt"/> Yankovic said that "fans would be rioting in the streets, I think, if I didn't do a polka medley."<ref name="livedaily 2007">{{cite web|url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/Weird_Al_talks_new_album_2007_tour-10776.html|title='Weird Al' talks new album, 2007 tour|access-date=October 26, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021191206/http://www.livedaily.com/news/Weird_Al_talks_new_album_2007_tour-10776.html?t=1|archive-date=October 21, 2006}}</ref> More current polka medleys features songs that Yankovic had wanted to parody but proved difficult, such as [[Daft Punk]]'s "[[Get Lucky (Daft Punk song)|Get Lucky]]", which lacked sufficient lyrics to parody.<ref name="avbook book excerpt"/> The polkas are recorded in studio, including the sound effects which are performed live during recording, which Yankovic considered one of his favorite parts of recording.<ref name="avbook book excerpt"/>

===Original songs===
Yankovic has recorded numerous original humorous songs, such as "[[You Don't Love Me Anymore ("Weird Al" Yankovic song)|You Don't Love Me Anymore]]" and "[[One More Minute]]".<ref name="faq"/> Many of these songs are style [[pastiches]] of specific bands with allusions to specific songs. For example, "First World Problems" from ''Mandatory Fun'' is a style take on the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], with the opening stanza reminiscent of the Pixies' "[[Debaser]]".<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.avclub.com/review/weird-al-yankovic-smartly-skewers-embraces-pop-cul-206851 | title = 'Weird Al' Yankovic smartly skewers, embraces pop culture | first = Annie | last = Zaleski | date = July 15, 2014 | access-date = August 8, 2014 | publisher = [[The A.V. Club]] }}</ref> Other style parodies includes those of [[Rage Against the Machine]] with "[[I'll Sue Ya]]" (which features many aspects of the hit song "[[Killing in the Name]]"), [[Devo]] with "[[Dare to Be Stupid (song)|Dare to Be Stupid]]", [[Talking Heads]] with "Dog Eat Dog", [[Frank Zappa]] with "Genius in France", [[Nine Inch Nails]] with "Germs", and [[Queen (band)|Queen]] with "Ringtone".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0100|title="Ask Al" Q&As for January 2000|access-date=October 30, 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061106023621/http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm| archive-date= November 6, 2006}}</ref> Some songs are pastiches of an overall [[music genre|genre]] of music, rather than a specific band (for example, [[country music]] with "Good Enough For Now", [[charity record]]s with "[[Don't Download This Song]]" and college fight songs with "Sports Song"). Yankovic stated that he does not have any unreleased original songs, instead coming up and committing to the song ideas he arrives at for his albums and other releases.<ref name="spin 2014">{{cite web | url = https://www.spin.com/2014/12/weird-al-yankovic-interview-best-of-2014-mandatory-fun/ | title = SPIN 2014 Exit Interviews: 'Weird Al' Yankovic | first = Dan | last = Weiss | date = December 19, 2014 | access-date = December 19, 2014 | work = [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] }}</ref>

Yankovic has contributed original songs to several films ("This Is the Life" from ''[[Johnny Dangerously]]''; "[[Polkamon]]" from the movie ''[[Pokémon: The Movie 2000]]'', and a parody of the [[James Bond]] title sequence in ''[[Spy Hard]]''), in addition to his own film, ''UHF''. Other songs of his have appeared in films or television series as well, such as "[[Dare to Be Stupid (song)|Dare to Be Stupid]]" in ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]''.

===Recurring themes===
One of Yankovic's recurring jokes involves the number [[27 (number)|27]]. It is mentioned in the lyrics of several songs, and seen on the covers for ''[[Running with Scissors ("Weird Al" Yankovic album)|Running with Scissors]]'', ''Poodle Hat''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/images/phathires.jpg|title=''Poodle Hat'' album cover|access-date=October 26, 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110612183015/http://www.weirdal.com/images/phathires.jpg| archive-date= June 12, 2011}}</ref> and ''[[Straight Outta Lynwood]]''. He had originally just pulled the number 27 as a random figure to use in filling out lyrics, but as his fans started to notice the reuse of the number after the first few times, he began to purposely drop references to 27 within his lyrics, videos, and album covers. He explains that "It's just a number I started using that people started attaching a lot of importance to."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/weird-al-yankovic,14163|title=Interview: "Weird Al" Yankovic|date=October 17, 2007|access-date=July 2, 2011|first=David|last=Wolinsky|publisher=[[The A.V. Club]]}}</ref> Other recurring jokes revolve around the names Bob (the ''Al TV'' interviews often mention the name,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGiUu2ciYY|title=Weird Al Interviews Avril Lavigne|access-date=October 29, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210155357/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGiUu2ciYY |archive-date=December 10, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> [[David Bowe (actor)|David Bowe]]'s character in ''UHF'' is named Bob, and a song called "Bob", done in the style of [[Bob Dylan]], is featured on ''Poodle Hat''), Frank (e.g. "Frank's 2000" TV"), and the surname "Finkelstein" (e.g. the music video for "[[I Lost on Jeopardy]]", or [[Fran Drescher]]'s character, Pamela Finkelstein, in ''UHF''). A number of songs use the phrase "internal organs". Also, a [[hamster]] called [[Harvey the Wonder Hamster]] is a recurring character in ''The Weird Al Show'' and the ''Al TV'' specials, as well as the subject of an original song on ''[[Alapalooza]]''. Other recurring jokes include Yankovic borrowing or being owed, $5. In a number of  ''Al TV'' interviews, he often asks if he can borrow $5, being turned down every time. This motif also occurs in "Why Does This Always Happen to Me?", in which his deceased friend owes him $5. Another recurring joke is his attraction to female nostrils or nostrils in general. This also appears in numerous  ''Al TV'' interviews as well as in several of his songs ("[[Albuquerque (song)|Albuquerque]]" and "[[Poodle Hat|Wanna B Ur Lovr]]" to name a few.) Yankovic also asks his celebrity guests if they could "shave his back for a nickel". This also appears in the song "Albuquerque". Yankovic has also put two [[backmasking]] messages into his songs. The first, in "Nature Trail to Hell", said "Satan Eats [[Cheez Whiz]]"; the second, in "I Remember Larry", said "Wow, you must have an awful lot of free time on your hands."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/faq/#secret|title=Al-oholics Anonymous' Frequently Asked Questions|access-date=August 24, 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060829151229/http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/faq/| archive-date= August 29, 2006}}</ref>

=== Music videos ===
While Yankovic's musical parodies generally do not include references to the songs or the artists of the original songs, Yankovic's music videos will sometimes parody the original song's music video in whole or in part.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/23/5926693/the-8-most-best-weird-al-parodies-video | title = The 8 best Weird Al parody videos | publisher = [[The Verge]] | date = July 23, 2014 | access-date = July 25, 2014 }}</ref> Most notably, the video for "Smells Like Nirvana" uses an extremely similar set to Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit", including using several of the same actors. This video contended with "Smells like Teen Spirit" at the 1992 [[MTV Video Music Awards]] for Best Male Video. Other videos that draw directly from those of the original song include "[[Eat It]]", "[[Fat (song)|Fat]]", "[[Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*]]", "[[Bedrock Anthem]]", "[[Headline News ("Weird Al" Yankovic song)|Headline News]]", "[[It's All About the Pentiums]]", "Amish Paradise", "[[Like a Surgeon]]", and "White & Nerdy". The video for "[[Dare to Be Stupid]]" is, as stated by Yankovic, a style parody in general of [[Devo]] videos.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0100|title=Ask Al" Q&As for January, 2000|access-date=August 5, 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070806052956/http://weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm| archive-date= August 6, 2007}}</ref>

Several videos have included appearances by notable celebrities in addition to Yankovic and his band. [[Dr. Demento]] appeared in several of Yankovic's earlier videos, such as "[[I Love Rocky Road]]" and "[[Ricky (song)|Ricky]]". Actor [[Dick Van Patten]] is featured in both "Smells Like Nirvana" and "Bedrock Anthem"; [[Drew Carey]], [[Emo Philips]] and [[Phil LaMarr]] appeared in "It's All About the Pentiums"; [[Keegan-Michael Key]], [[Jordan Peele]], [[Donny Osmond]], [[Judy Tenuta]] and [[Seth Green]] appeared in "White & Nerdy"; and [[Ruth Buzzi]] and [[Pat Boone]] appeared in "Gump". The video for "[[I Lost on Jeopardy]]" includes an appearance by [[Greg Kihn]], the artist whose song, "Jeopardy", was being parodied, along with [[Don Pardo]] and [[Art Fleming]], Jeopardy's original announcer and host, as themselves. [[Florence Henderson]] plays an Amish seductress in "Amish Paradise".

While most videos that Yankovic creates are aired on music channels such as MTV and [[VH1]], Yankovic worked with animation artists to create music videos for release with extended content albums. The [[DualDisc]] version of ''Straight Outta Lynwood'' features six videos set to songs from the release, including videos created by [[Bill Plympton]] and [[John Kricfalusi]]; one video, "Weasel Stomping Day" was created by the producers of the show ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', and aired as a segment of that program. For the 2010 ''Alpocalypse'', Yankovic produced videos for every song; four of those were previously released for each of the songs on the EP ''[[Internet Leaks]]'', with the videos for the remaining songs released via social media sites and included in the deluxe edition of ''Alpocalypse''. These live-action and animated videos were produced by both previous collaborators such as Plympton for "TMZ",<ref name="coedmag plympton"/> video content providers like [[Jib-Jab]] and [[SuperNews!]], and other directors and animators.

To help promote his 2014 album ''Mandatory Fun'' in social media circles, Yankovic produced eight music videos for the album releasing them over eight consecutive days with release of the album, believing it "would make an impact because people would be talking about the album all week long".<ref name="foxnews 8days">{{cite web | url = http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/07/18/weird-al-yankovic-adapint-to-digital-age/ | title = Weird Al Yankovic adapting to digital age | first = Ashley | last = Dvohrik | date = July 18, 2014 | access-date = July 19, 2014 | publisher = [[Fox News]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://time.com/2949882/weird-al-yankovic-not-that-weird/ | title = The Al Yankovic Paradox: He Doesn't Seem That Weird Anymore | first = Lily | last = Rothman | date = July 2, 2014 | access-date = July 2, 2014 | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] }}</ref> RCA Records opted not to fund production of any of these videos, and Yankovic turned to various social media portals including [[Funny or Die]] and [[CollegeHumor]] which he had worked with in the past; these sites helped to cover the production cost of the videos with Yankovic foregoing any ad video revenue.

=== Reactions from original artists ===
Under the "[[fair use]]" provision of U.S. [[copyright]] law, affirmed by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in the 1994 case ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]'', artists such as Yankovic do not need permission to record a parody.<ref name="rs chicken pot pie">{{cite web| url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/flashback-weird-als-rejected-wings-parody-chicken-pot-pie-20160526 | title = Flashback: Weird Al's Rejected Wings Parody, 'Chicken Pot Pie' | first = Andy | last = Greene | date = May 26, 2016 |access-date = October 13, 2016 | work = [[Rolling Stone]] }}</ref> However, as a personal rule and as a means of maintaining good relationships, Yankovic has always sought permission from the original artist before commercially releasing a parody.<ref name="rs chicken pot pie"/><ref name="avbook book excerpt"/> Yankovic stated of these efforts: "I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings. I don't want to be embroiled in any nastiness. That's not how I live my life. I like everybody to be in on the joke and be happy for my success. I take pains not to burn bridges."<ref name="wapost feb2017"/> The communications are typically handled by his manager Jay Levey, but at times Yankovic has asked the artist directly, such as flying to [[Denver]], Colorado, to attend an [[Iggy Azalea]] concert and speak to her personally about parodying her song "[[Fancy (Iggy Azalea song)|Fancy]]".<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/6188148/why-weird-al-yankovic-means-big-business | title = Why 'Weird Al' Yankovic Means Big Business | first = Gary | last =Graff | date = July 25, 2014 | access-date=  July 26, 2014 | work = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] }}</ref> He claims that only about two to three percent of the artists he approaches for permission deny his requests.<ref name="wired gaga"/>

Separately, Yankovic needs to negotiate for [[royalty payment|royalties]] to the original artists for including their songs within a polka medley, which is considered a [[cover version|cover]] in copyright law. This created difficulties in recording his first medley "Polkas on 45" since it involved thirteen different royalty schemes, but since then he has established a relationship with most large music publishers to easily secure the license to use their songs.<ref name="avbook book excerpt"/>

[[Michael Jackson]] was a big fan of Yankovic, and Yankovic claimed Jackson "had always been very supportive" of his work.<ref name="wired gaga"/> Jackson twice allowed him to parody his songs ("[[Beat It]]" and "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]" became "[[Eat It]]" and "[[Fat (song)|Fat]]", respectively).

[[Dave Grohl]] of Nirvana said that the band felt they had "made it" after Yankovic recorded "Smells Like Nirvana", a parody of the [[grunge]] band's smash hit, "Smells Like Teen Spirit".<ref name="faq"/> On his ''Behind the Music'' special, Yankovic stated that when he called Nirvana frontman [[Kurt Cobain]] to ask if he could parody the song, Cobain gave him permission, then paused and asked, "Um... it's not gonna be about food, is it?" Yankovic responded with, "No, it'll be about how no one can understand your lyrics." According to Nirvana bassist [[Krist Novoselic]] interviewed for ''Behind the Music'', when the band saw the video of the song, they were laughing hysterically. Additionally, Cobain described Yankovic as "America's modern pop-rock genious [sic]" in his posthumously released personal notebook.<ref name="spin 20th" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/gig-previews--reviews/weird-al-yankovic/2007/03/19/1174152930142.html|title=Weird Al Yankovic – Gig previews & reviews|access-date=April 16, 2007|location=Melbourne, Australia|work=The Age|date=March 19, 2007|first=Guy|last=Blackman}}</ref>

[[Mark Knopfler]] approved Yankovic's parody of the [[Dire Straits]] song "[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]" for use in the film ''UHF'' on the provision that Knopfler himself be allowed to play lead guitar on the parody which was later titled "[[Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0946148/bio|title=Biography for 'Weird Al' Yankovic|access-date=September 15, 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071020193329/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0946148/bio| archive-date= October 20, 2007}}</ref> Yankovic commented on the legal complications of the parody in the DVD audio commentary for ''UHF'', explaining "We had to name that song 'Money for Nothing "slash" Beverly Hillbillies "asterisk"' because the lawyers told us that had to be the name.

[[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|The Presidents of the United States of America]] were so pleased with "Gump", Yankovic's parody of their song "Lump", that they ended the song with his last line instead of their own ("And that's all I have to say about that") on the live recording of "Lump" featured on the compilation album ''[[Pure Frosting]]''. In 2008, Yankovic directed the music video for their song "[[Mixed Up S.O.B.]]"

[[Don McLean]] was reportedly pleased with "The Saga Begins", a parody of "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]", and told Yankovic that the parody's lyrics sometimes enter his mind during live performances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0999|title="Ask Al" Q&As for September 1999|access-date=October 29, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902121655/http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0999|archive-date=September 2, 2006}}</ref> His parody not only replicates the music from the original [[Don McLean]] song, but it replicates the multi-layered rhyming structure in the verses and chorus.

[[Chamillionaire]] was also very pleased, even putting Yankovic's parody "White & Nerdy" (a parody of "[[Ridin']]") on his official [[MySpace]] page before it was on Yankovic's own page. Chamillionaire stated in an interview, "He's actually [[rapping]] pretty good on it, it's crazy [...] I didn't know he could rap like that. It's really an honor when he does that.

In 2011, Yankovic was initially denied permission to parody [[Lady Gaga]]'s "[[Born This Way (song)|Born This Way]]" for his song "Perform This Way" for release on a new album, but through his release of the song on YouTube and subsequent spread via Twitter, Lady Gaga and her staff asserted that her manager had made the decision without her input, and Gaga herself gave Yankovic permission to proceed with the parody's release.<ref name="wired gaga">{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2011/06/weird-al-yankovic-alpocalypse|title=Alpocalypse Now: 'Weird Al' Yankovic Says 'Twitter Saved My Album'|first=Angela|last=Watercutter|date=June 20, 2011|access-date=June 20, 2011|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref><ref name="Gaga Saga">{{cite web|first=Alfred |last=Yankovic |title=The gaga saga |date=April 20, 2011 |url=http://alyankovic.wordpress.com/the-gaga-saga |access-date=April 20, 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5y61XzOga?url=http://alyankovic.wordpress.com/the-gaga-saga/ |archive-date=April 20, 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Gaga considered herself "a huge Weird Al fan",<ref>{{cite web|last=TMZ.com|title=Lady Gaga – I Didn't Reject Weird Al Yankovic|publisher=TMZ.com|date=April 20, 2011|url=https://www.tmz.com/2011/04/20/weird-al-yankovic-lady-gaga-rejected-born-this-way-parody-perform-this-way|access-date=April 20, 2011}}</ref> and she stated that the parody was a "rite of passage" for her musical career and considered the song "very empowering".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/videos/new-and-hot/lady-gaga-weird-al-parody-empowering-20110525|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528113911/http://www.rollingstone.com/videos/new-and-hot/lady-gaga-weird-al-parody-empowering-20110525|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 28, 2011|title=Lady Gaga – Weird Al parody 'empowering'|date=May 25, 2011|access-date=June 20, 2011|work=Rolling Stone}}</ref>

Yankovic states that his style parodies have also been met with positive remarks by the original artist. He noted that his friends and fellow musicians [[Ben Folds]] and [[Taylor Hanson]] helped to support their respective style parodies "Why Does This Always Happen To Me?" and "If That Isn't Love". He also noted positive reactions he got through friends his band members have, such as from [[Frank Black]] of [[The Pixies]] for "First World Problems" and [[Southern Culture on the Skids]] for "Lame Claim to Fame", and a similar praise when he encountered [[Graham Nash]] of [[Crosby, Stills, and Nash]] on the street, and was able to play his recently completed "Mission Statement" for him.<ref name="spin 2014"/>

==== Negative ====
[[File:Coolio.jpg|thumb|[[Coolio]] reacted negatively to "[[Amish Paradise]]", feeling it undermined the serious message of [[Gangsta Paradise|the original song]].]]
One of Yankovic's most controversial parodies was 1996's "Amish Paradise", based on "[[Gangsta's Paradise (song)|Gangsta's Paradise]]" by hip-hop artist Coolio, which, in turn, was based on "[[Pastime Paradise]]" by [[Stevie Wonder]]. Reportedly, Coolio's label gave Yankovic the impression that Coolio had granted permission to record the parody, but Coolio maintains that he never did. While Coolio claimed he was upset, legal action never materialized, and Coolio accepted [[Royalties|royalty]] payments for the song. After this controversy, Yankovic has always made sure to speak directly with the artist of every song he parodied. At the [[XM Satellite Radio]] booth at the 2006 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] Yankovic and Coolio made peace. On his website, Yankovic wrote of this event, "I don't remember what we said to each other exactly, but it was all very friendly. I doubt I'll be invited to Coolio's next birthday party, but at least I can stop wearing that bulletproof vest to the mall."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#042706 |title="Ask Al" Q&As for April 27, 2006 |access-date=September 2, 2006 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5gv2Zw4KL?url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm |archive-date=May 20, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In an interview in 2014, Coolio extended his apology for refusing his permission, stating that at the time "I was being cocky and shit and being stupid and I was wrong and I should've embraced that shit and went with it", and that he considered Yankovic's parody "actually funny as shit".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/blog/after-all-these-years-coolio-still-lets-his-nuts-hang |title=After All These Years, Coolio Still Lets His Nuts Hang |date=April 28, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318041016/http://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/blog/after-all-these-years-coolio-still-lets-his-nuts-hang |archive-date=March 18, 2015 |access-date=July 15, 2014 |work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |first=Dan |last=Ozzi}}</ref>

In 2000, [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] bassist [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] told ''Behind the Music'' that he was unimpressed and disappointed by Yankovic's 1993 song "Bedrock Anthem", which parodied two of the band's songs.

==== Refused parodies ====
On numerous occasions, [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] refused Yankovic permission to record parodies of his songs.

[[Paul McCartney]], also a Yankovic fan, refused Yankovic permission to record a parody of [[Wings (band)|Wings]]' "[[Live and Let Die (song)|Live and Let Die]]", titled "Chicken Pot Pie", because, according to Yankovic, McCartney is "a strict vegetarian and he didn't want a parody that condoned the consumption of animal flesh".<ref name="rs chicken pot pie"/> Though McCartney suggested possibly changing the parody to "Tofu Pot Pie", Yankovic, who is also a vegetarian, found this would not fit the lyrics he had written, which featured the sound of a chicken throughout the chorus. While never recorded for an album, Yankovic did play parts of "Chicken Pot Pie" as part of a larger medley in several tours during the 1990s.<ref name="rs chicken pot pie"/>

In 2003, Yankovic was denied permission to make a video for "[[Couch Potato (song)|Couch Potato]]", his parody of [[Eminem]]'s "[[Lose Yourself]]".

In 2006, Yankovic gained [[James Blunt]]'s permission to record a parody of "[[You're Beautiful]]". However, after Yankovic had recorded "You're Pitiful", Blunt's label, [[Atlantic Records]], rescinded this permission, despite Blunt's personal approval of the song.<ref name="wired gaga"/> The parody was pulled from Yankovic's ''[[Straight Outta Lynwood]]'' because of his label's unwillingness to "go to war" with Atlantic. Yankovic released the song as a free download on his MySpace profile, as well as his official website, and plays it in concert, since it was not Blunt himself objecting to the parody.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5482774|title=Free 'Weird Al' Yankovic!|newspaper=NPR|date=June 13, 2006|access-date=August 24, 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060820173526/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5482774| archive-date= August 20, 2006|last1=Thompson|first1=Stephen}}</ref> Yankovic referenced the incident in his video for "White & Nerdy" when he depicts himself vandalizing Atlantic Records' Wikipedia article.

Yankovic was considering a complete polka medley with only [[U2]] songs, but was denied the rights by the band.<ref name="avbook book excerpt"/> Similarly, he had included [[Weezer]]'s "[[Buddy Holly (song)|Buddy Holly]]" in a polka medley, but had to pull it when the band refused rights for it.<ref name="avbook book excerpt"/>

A second concert film, ''[["Weird Al" Yankovic Live!: The Alpocalypse Tour]]'', aired on [[Comedy Central]] on October 1, 2011, and was released on Blu-ray and DVD three days later. The concert was filmed at [[Massey Hall]] in Toronto, Canada, during Yankovic's tour supporting the album ''Alpocalypse''. As before, video clips (apart from those for his own videos) and unreleased songs were edited out for legal reasons.

Yankovic performed [[George Harrison]]'s "[[What Is Life]]" at the live-recorded [[George Fest]] (Los Angeles, 2014). DVD and Blu-Ray CD combos of the concert honoring Harrison became available in early 2016.

Following the release of ''Mandatory Fun'', Yankovic toured across the United States, Canada, and selected overseas venues in the "[[Mandatory World Tour]]" from 2015 through 2016, principally featuring songs from this album. After taking a year off, Yankovic returned to tour in the United States and Canada from February to June 2018 in "[[The Ridiculously Self-Indulgent, Ill-Advised Vanity Tour]]". On this tour, he performed mostly original songs (not parodies) and did not use costumes, props, or video screens. Comedian [[Emo Philips]] was the opening act.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Menta |first1=Anna |title=Weird Al Tour Dates Are Here, but the Shows Are 'Not for Everybody' |url=http://www.newsweek.com/weird-al-tour-dates-684571 |website=[[Newsweek]].com |access-date=October 13, 2017 |date=October 13, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Tour |url=http://weirdal.com/tour/ |website=WeirdAl.com |access-date=October 13, 2017}}</ref> A further staple of this tour was Yankovic's cover performance of a different famous song at each venue, which Yankovic stated was something he and his band enjoyed doing.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/hear-all-77-covers-weird-al-played-on-2018-tour-628740/ | title = Hear All 77 Covers 'Weird Al' Played on 2018 Tour | first=  Andy | last= Green | date = June 14, 2018 | access-date = October 31, 2018 | work = [[Rolling Stone]] }}</ref>

===Legacy and influence===
With "[[Word Crimes]]" from ''Mandatory Fun'' debuting at No. 39 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in 2014, Yankovic became the third musical artist after Michael Jackson and Madonna to have a song in the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 over each decade since the 1980s, his other Top 40 songs being "Eat It", "Smells Like Nirvana", and "White & Nerdy".<ref name="bb2">{{Cite web | url =https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6176808/magic-rude-no-1-hot-100-sam-smith-stay-with-me-iggy-azalea | title = MAGIC!'s 'Rude' No. 1 On Hot 100, Sam Smith's 'Stay With Me' Surges | work = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | date = July 22, 2014 | access-date = July 22, 2014 | first = Gary | last =Trust }}</ref> Since then, only [[U2]] and [[Kenny G]] have also entered this group.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8542554/kenny-g-top-40-hits-four-decades-kanye-west-use-this-gospel | title = Thanks to Kanye, Kenny G Is Just the Fifth Act With Hot 100 Top 40 Hits in Each of the Last Four Decades | first= Gary | last= Trust | date = November 4, 2019 | access-date = April 10, 2020 | work =[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] }}</ref> ''Billboard'' named Yankovic #15 of the top 100 music video artists of all time in an August 2020 compilation, addressing that alongside his musical fame, "his accompanying video parodies are a vital part of the recipe".<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/list/9440075/100-best-music-video-artists | title= The 100 Greatest Music Video Artists of All Time: Staff List | date = August 27, 2020 | access-date = August 28, 2020 | work = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] }}</ref>

With his four-decade career, Yankovic's work has also influenced newer artists.

=== ''UHF'' ===
{{Main|UHF (film)}}
In 1989, Yankovic starred in a full-length feature film called ''UHF'', co-written by himself and manager Jay Levey and filmed in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. A satire of the television and film industries, also starring [[Michael Richards]], [[Fran Drescher]], and [[Victoria Jackson]], it brought floundering studio [[Orion Pictures|Orion]] their highest [[test screening|test scores]] since the movie ''[[RoboCop]]''.<ref name="robo">{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0599 |title="Ask Al" Q&As for May, 1999|access-date=October 28, 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061106023621/http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm| archive-date= November 6, 2006}}</ref> However, it was unsuccessful in theaters due to both poor critical reception and competition from other summer blockbusters at the time such as ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', ''[[Lethal Weapon 2]]'', ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' and ''[[Licence to Kill]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.avclub.com/article/weird-als-iuhf-iis-uneven-but-that-just-made-it-ah-81212 | title = Weird Al's UHF is uneven, but that just made it ahead of its time  | publisher = [[The A.V.

The film has since become a [[Cult film|cult classic]], with out-of-print copies of the VHS version selling for up to $100 on [[eBay]] until the release of the DVD in 2002.{{Citation needed|date = April 2011}} Yankovic occasionally shows clips from the film at his concerts (to which [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], the film's current owner, initially objected in the form of a [[cease and desist]] letter).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0500 |title="Ask Al" Q&As for May, 2000|access-date=October 26, 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061106023621/http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm| archive-date= November 6, 2006}}</ref> In an apparent attempt to make it more accessible to overseas audiences, where the term [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] is used less frequently to describe TV broadcasts, the film was titled ''The Vidiot From UHF'' in Australia and parts of Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098546/ |title=UHF (1989)|date=July 21, 1989|access-date=October 26, 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061015173637/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098546/| archive-date= October 15, 2006}}</ref>

''UHF'' shows the creation of Yankovic's signature food—the Twinkie Wiener Sandwich. The snack consists of an overturned [[Twinkie]] split open as a makeshift bun, a [[hot dog]], and [[Easy Cheese]] put together and dipped in milk before eating. Yankovic has stated that he has switched to using [[tofu]] hot dogs since becoming a vegetarian, but still enjoys the occasional Twinkie Wiener Sandwich.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#1095 |title=Midnight Star 'Ask Al' Q&As for October/November, 1995|access-date=October 26, 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061106023621/http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm| archive-date= November 6, 2006}}</ref>

=== Live television ===
In his early career, Yankovic hosted the specials ''Al TV'' on MTV and ''Al Music'' on [[MuchMusic]] many times, generally coinciding with the release of each new album. These shows typically included some of Yankovic's videos to date and previews of songs on the upcoming album. A recurring segment of  ''Al TV'' involves Yankovic manipulating interviews for comic effect. He inserts himself into a previously conducted interview with a musician, and then manipulates his questions, resulting in bizarre and comic responses from the celebrity.

''[[The Weird Al Show]]'' was a live action skit-based children's show hosted by Yankovic, airing from September to December 1997 on [[CBS]], which featured several actors and bands as guests along with Yankovic and other actors. It was designed to be part of CBS's mandated [[E/I|Educational or Informative]] programming to teach children morals. The show had a troubled production due to this requirement and the desire by CBS to follow in the success of ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'', leading to the show's cancellation after one 13-episode season. The entire series was released on DVD by [[Shout! Factory]] on August 15, 2006.

[[VH1]] produced a ''[[Behind the Music]]'' episode on Yankovic. His two commercial failures (his film ''UHF'' and his 1986 album ''[[Polka Party!]]'') were presented as having a larger impact on the direction of his career than they really had. Also, Coolio's later disapproval of "Amish Paradise" was played up as a large feud. Much was also made over his apparent lack of a love life, though he got married shortly after the program aired. The episode was updated and re-released in early 2012 as part of the "Behind the Music Remastered" series.

Yankovic performed at the [[66th Primetime Emmy Awards]] singing a comedic medley of songs based on the themes of several Emmy-nominated shows such as ''[[Mad Men]]'' and ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.vulture.com/2014/08/watch-weird-al-emmys-tv-theme-song-medley.html | title = Watch Weird Al's Emmys TV Theme-Song Medley | first = Gilbert | last = Cruz | date = August 25, 2014 | access-date=  August 25, 2014 | work = [[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]] }}</ref>

=== Animation and voice work ===
Yankovic has done voice-overs for several animated series. He appeared in a 2003 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', singing "The Ballad of Homer & Marge" (a parody of [[John Mellencamp]]'s "[[Jack & Diane]]") with his band. The episode, "[[Three Gays of the Condo]]", in which [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] hires Yankovic to sing the aforementioned song to [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] in an attempt to reconcile their marriage, later won an [[Emmy Award]] for "Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming Less Than One Hour)". Yankovic also had a cameo in a 2008 episode, titled "[[That '90s Show (The Simpsons)|That '90s Show]]", during which he records a parody of Homer's grunge hit "Shave Me" titled "Brain Freeze" (Homer's song, "Shave Me", was itself a parody of Nirvana's "[[Rape Me]]") making Yankovic one of only a handful of celebrities to appear twice on the show playing themselves.

He appeared in the animated [[Adult Swim]] show ''Robot Chicken'', which provided him with a music video for the song "Weasel Stomping Day".<ref name="adult">{{cite AV media | url=http://video.adultswim.com/robot-chicken/weasel-stomping-day.html | title=Weasel Stomping Day | publisher=[[Adult Swim]] | medium=[[Cartoon Network]] | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514060537/http://video.adultswim.com/robot-chicken/weasel-stomping-day.html | archive-date=May 14, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="about">{{cite web | url=http://humor.about.com/od/comediansr/a/weird_al_qa_2.htm | title="Weird Al" Yankovic: An Interview About Humor | publisher=[[About.com]] | access-date=April 8, 2012 | author=Durrett, Mike | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205193149/http://humor.about.com/od/comediansr/a/weird_al_qa_2.htm | archive-date=February 5, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Yankovic is the voice for [[List of characters in The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy#Toadblatt's Summer School of Sorcery|Squid Hat]] on the [[Cartoon Network]] show, ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy]]''.

He also plays local TV talent show host Uncle Muscles on several episodes of ''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'' along with other appearances on the show. Weird Al has also supplied the voice of one-shot character 'Petroleum Joe' on ''[[The Brak Show]]''.

In 2015, Al voiced the supervillain [[Darkseid]] in a season 15 episode of [[Teen Titans Go!]]. He initially speaks with a deep, intimidating voice, but after complaining about having a cold and taking a [[lozenge]], Al speaks in his normal voice, and the heroes are no longer afraid of him. Another character points out that Darkseid sounds like Weird Al Yankovic, and the villain replies that Weird Al was "a true monster" for "undercutting musicians by subverting their words and compromising their artistic integrity." One of the protagonists calls Al "a national treasure", and they began to battle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoZ9C9_TTQM|title=Darkseid Sounds Like Weird Al I Teen Titans Go I Cartoon Network|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref>

[[Eric Appel]] produced a ''[[Funny or Die]]'' movie trailer for ''Weird: The Al Yankovic Story'', a fictional biographical film that parodies other films based on musicians; Yankovic (played by [[Aaron Paul]]) is seen hiding his "weirdness" from his parents ([[Gary Cole]] and [[Mary Steenburgen]]), making it big using song parodies with the help of Dr. Demento ([[Patton Oswalt]]), falling in and out of love with Madonna ([[Olivia Wilde]]), and fading into alcoholism and being arrested, at which point his father finally admits he is "weird" as well. Yankovic himself plays a music producer in the short.<ref name="rs 13th album"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://newsroom.mtv.com/2010/03/24/weird-al-yankovic-movie/ | archive-url = https://archive.today/20120712000611/http://newsroom.mtv.com/2010/03/24/weird-al-yankovic-movie/ | url-status = dead | archive-date = July 12, 2012 | title = 'Weird Al' Yankovic Gets The Parody Biopic He Deserves | date = March 24, 2010 | access-date = March 24, 2010 | first = Kyle | last = Anderson | publisher = MTV }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://scitech.blogs.cnn.com/2010/03/23/geek-out-trailer-for-weird-al-biopic-up-on-funny-or-die/ | title=  Geek Out!: Trailer for Weird Al 'biopic' up on Funny or Die | date = March 23, 2010 | access-date =March 24, 2010 | publisher = CNN | first = Doug | last = Gross }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2010/03/24/weird-al-gets-serious-biopic-treatment-thanks-to-funny-or-die/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100328192543/http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2010/03/24/weird-al-gets-serious-biopic-treatment-thanks-to-funny-or-die/ | url-status = dead | archive-date = March 28, 2010 | title = 'Weird Al' Gets Serious Biopic Treatment Thanks to Funny or Die | first = Daniel | last = Kreps | date = March 24, 2010 | access-date =March 25, 2010 |work=Rolling Stone }}</ref> Yankovic later appeared in another ''Funny or Die'' short alongside [[Huey Lewis]] which parodied the ax murder scene in the movie ''[[American Psycho (film)|American Psycho]]'', in which [[Christian Bale]]'s character [[Patrick Bateman]] discusses the nature of Lewis's musical work before killing his victim.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.spin.com/2013/04/weird-al-yankovic-huey-lewis-american-psycho-spoof-video/  |title = Watch Huey Lewis Ax-Murder 'Weird Al' in 'American Psycho' Spoof | work = [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] | date = April 4, 2013 | access-date = November 12, 2015 | first = Chris | last = Martins }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/e3662085fb/american-psycho-with-huey-lewis-and-weird-al | title = American Psycho with Huey Lewis and Weird Al | work = [[Funny or Die]] | date = April 3, 2013 | access-date = November 12, 2015 }}</ref>

== Misattribution and imitators ==
[[File:WeirdAlLimeWire.png|thumb|upright|A screenshot of [[LimeWire]] PRO, showing a large number of parodies misattributed to Yankovic, as well as numerous misspellings of his surname ({{start date|2007|02}})]]

Songs posted to [[file sharing]] networks are often misattributed to him because of their humorous subject matter. Often, his surname is misspelled (and thus mispronounced) as "Yankovich", among other variations. Much to the disdain of Yankovic, these misattributed files include songs that are racist, sexually explicit, or otherwise offensive. A young listener who had heard several of these offensive tracks by way of a file sharing service confronted Yankovic online, threatening a boycott because of his supposedly explicit lyrics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#100205 |title='Ask Al' Q&As for October 2, 2005 |access-date=August 24, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010626120633/http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm |archive-date=June 26, 2001 }}</ref> Quite a few of the songs, such as "[[Star Wars Cantina (song)#Parody song|Star Wars Cantina]]" by [[Mark Jonathan Davis]] (not, in a double misattribution, his lounge-singer character [[Richard Cheese]]), "[[Star Wars Gangsta Rap]]", "Yoda Smokes Weed", "Chewbacca", "[[The Devil Went Down to Georgia#Parody song|The Devil Went to Jamaica]]", "[[The Twelve Pains of Christmas]]" by [[Bob Rivers]] and several more have a ''[[Star Wars]]'' motif.<ref name="notalpage">{{cite web |url=http://free.house.cx/~eil/etc/notal_list.html |title=The Not Al Page: The most popular songs he didn't even write (or perform)! |access-date=December 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080728111957/http://free.house.cx/~eil/etc/notal_list.html |archive-date = July 28, 2008}}</ref> Some songs misattributed to him are not songs, but spoken skits, such as "[[Sesame Street]] on Crack", which is also widely misattributed to [[Adam Sandler]].

Yankovic cites these misattributions as "his only real beef with [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] sites":

{{Blockquote|If you do a search for my name on any one of those sites, I guarantee you that about half of the songs that come up will be songs I had absolutely nothing to do with.
