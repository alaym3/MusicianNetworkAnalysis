'''Kristian Humaidan''' (born 1981, [[Svendborg]], Denmark), better known by his stage name '''UFO''', is a Danish singer, rapper and hip hop artist. He was part of the rap duo '''[[UFO Yepha]]''' before splitting-up and going solo. With the split, UFO is noticeably branching into Danish music rather than hip hop as in the days with Yepha.

{{Main|UFO & Yepha}}
Kristian Humaidan (known as UFO) won the freestyle championship [[MC's Fight Night]] in 2002. Soon he started collaborating as a duo with Jeppe Bruun Wahlstrøm (known as Yepha, born 1983)<ref>[http://www.basunen.dk/html/ufo_og_yepha.html Basunen.dk: UFO og Yepha]</ref> through [[Svendborg]], and later from [[Aarhus]]. They were also known as '''Whyyou''' (taking lead from first letters of their names). They had a good number of chart successes before they split-up as a duo in 2011.

They had three albums charting on the official [[Danish Albums Chart]] as follows:
*''U vs. Y'' (2003 – reached #28)
*''Ingen som os'' (2006 – reached #20)
*''Kig mig i øjnene'' (2008 – reached #32)

They released many singles as UFO and Yepha including charting singles:
*"Hver dag" (2003, reached #1)
*"Næh næh" <small>(Ufo Yepha feat. [[Anna David (singer)|Anna David]])</small> (2008 – reached #20)
*"Stille og roligt knald pa" (2009, reached #27)

==2011– : Solo career==
