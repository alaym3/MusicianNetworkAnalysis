{{nihongo|'''Yukiko Okada'''|岡田 有希子|Okada Yukiko|August 22, 1967 – April 8, 1986}} was a Japanese singer and actress, active in the mid-1980s. After winning a nationwide television show at age 15 in 1983, she debuted as an [[Japanese idol|idol]] in 1984. Her death by [[suicide]] two years later led to a number of [[copycat suicide]]s, a phenomenon that would bear her name.

== Early life ==

Okada was born as Satō Kayo<ref name="wetherall">William Wetherall, [http://www.yoshabunko.com/suicide/Okada_Yukiko.html "The suicide of Okada Yukiko: Japanese youth and the Yukko Syndrome"], ''[[Far Eastern Economic Review]]'', July 17, 1986</ref>  (佐藤佳代) on August 22, 1967, the second daughter of the Satō family. The family later moved to [[Nagoya]]. In elementary school, Okada loved to read, especially manga, and she was a talented artist. In junior high school, Okada wanted to become a singer and applied for every possible audition, anything from major productions to the smallest talent recruitment, hoping to become a star. She was rejected every time until she was finally accepted to a TV talent program, ''[[Star Tanjō!]]'' on [[Nippon Television]] – similar to ''[[Star Search]]'', though the final stage was her singing to get interest from talent agents – singing Kitahara Sawako's "MY BOYFRIEND" for the audition, and [[Akina Nakamori]]'s "Slow Motion" for the final round, which she won in March 1983.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

== Career ==
Okada made her debut in 1984,<ref name="wetherall" /> when on April that year, she released her first single, "First Date", written by composer and singer [[Mariya Takeuchi]],<ref name = "takeuchi" /> later famous internationally for the [[city pop]] song "[[Plastic Love]]". She was nicknamed "Yukko" (ユッコ) by her fans, which is a common abbreviation for the name "Yukiko" in the Japanese language.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} Her smile bore the same name: the "Yukko smile".<ref name = "Pulvers">{{Cite web | last=Pulvers | first=Roger| date = 20 September 2009|title=Now suicide has become a political issue, how will Japan address it?|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2009/09/20/commentary/now-suicide-has-become-a-political-issue-how-will-japan-address-it/|access-date=22 June 2021|publisher=[[The Japan Times]]|language=en-US}}</ref>

Okada won Rookie of the Year in the year of her debut,{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}. and she was awarded the [[26th Japan Record Awards]] Grand Prix Best New Artist Award<ref name="minamino" /> for her third single, "-Dreaming Girl- Koi, Hajimemashite", also written by Takeuchi.<ref name = "m-on">{{cite web | url = https://www.m-on-music.jp/0000373709/ | title = 伝説のアイドル・岡田有希子のソングブックアルバムが異例のヒット！ 在りし日の姿が甦るトレーラー映像も大好評 | publisher = M-ON!

== Death ==
[[File:Sun Music Building in Tokyo 1999.jpg|thumb|The Sun Music Building, located in [[Yotsuya]], Tokyo]]

On April 8, 1986, Okada was found with a slashed wrist in her gas-filled Tokyo apartment, crouching in a closet and crying.<ref name="wetherall" /> She was discovered by a rescue team called in by the apartment's manager after other residents noticed the smell of gas. Okada's manager eventually arrived and took her to nearby {{Interlanguage link|Kita Aoyama Hospital|ja|北青山病院}}, where her injuries were treated.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

In a 2016 article on the ''[[The Asahi Shimbun|Asahi Weekly]]'', Sun Music former managing director<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.oricon.co.jp/special/52114/ |title = サンミュージック波乱の50年 引きずった岡田有希子の死「お父さんの一言に救われた」|date= 11 November 2018 |publisher = [[Oricon|Oricon News]] |language=Japanese |trans-title=50 years of Sun Music upheaval, Yukiko Okada's death, "I was saved by a word from her father" |access-date= 28 February 2021}}</ref> Tokio Fukuda recalled that Sun Music founder Hideyoshi Aizawa called him to pick up Okada from the hospital. When he met her, she was crying softly. He then asked her where she wanted to go: to her parents' home in Nagoya, her apartment, or the office. She replied that the office was good, so she was brought to the sixth floor of the Sun Music building. Aizawa then called Fukuda, leading him to step out.

While Fukuda, the management director and the staff were discussing how to avoid a media scandal,<ref name = "fukuda" /> Okada ran to the stairs, took off her shoes and jumped from the seven-story Sun Music building, resulting in instant death. It was 12:15 PM JST.<ref name="wetherall" /><ref name = "Pulvers" />

The reason for the suicide is still unknown. Okada was reported to have been "[u]pset and depressed about an unhappy love affair",<ref name = "greenless">John Greenless, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19870411&id=TRA1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=sKULAAAAIBAJ&pg=3855,2923905 Paradox ò Japan Epidemic of suicides among young people], The Glasgow Herald – 11.

Minegishi said that "he thought of her more as a younger sister".<ref name="minegishi" /> When asked if a relationship with an actor (who the article cited did not name) was the cause, Fukuda replied that he did not know.<ref name = "fukuda" />

Okada's remains were cremated,<ref name="wetherall" /> and were interred at the Jōman-ji Temple, [[Aisai]], [[Aichi Prefecture]], Japan.<ref name="minamino" />

== Legacy ==

Her fans were shocked and shattered by her untimely death. It resulted in many [[copycat suicide]]s in Japan,<ref name = "greenless" /> soon christened with the [[neologism]] "Yukiko Syndrome"<ref name = "greenless" /> or "Yukko Syndrome."<ref name="googlebooks">[https://books.google.de/books?id=cTLSH4RIqk0C&pg=PA97&lpg=PA97&dq=%22yukiko+syndrome%22&source=bl&ots=nA8XEo6tY9&sig=5PR8sSHIseqqwDmLwsI9NS9iOMY&hl=de&sa=X&ei=F3OLU-CYC--w7Ab8tYHQBQ&ved=0CKgBEOgBMA8#v=onepage&q=%22yukiko%20syndrome%22&f=false Japanese Society Since 1945] by Edward R.

In turn, it has been suggested that Okada may have had in mind idol [[Yasuko Endō]], who also committed suicide by falling from a rooftop ten days earlier.<ref name="googlebooks" /><ref name="wetherall" />

A ninth single, scheduled for release on 14 April 1986, was postponed on fears of more suicides.<ref name="wetherall" /> The single, "花のイマージュ" (Hana no Image), was eventually released.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

Mariya Takeuchi covered three of the songs she wrote for Okada on her fortieth anniversary album ''Turntable''. A compilation album of all eleven songs Takeuchi wrote for Okada, ''Yukiko Okada Mariya's Songbook'', was released in 2019,<ref name = "m-on" /><ref name = "oricon-mariya-songbook" /> and debuted at no. 13 on the Oricon Weekly Album Chart on October 28, 2019.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.oricon.co.jp/rank/ja/w/2019-10-28/p/2/ | title = オリコン週間 アルバムランキング 2019年10月14日～2019年10月20日 11～20位 | publisher = [[Oricon|ORICON NEWS]] | date = 28 October 2019 | language = Japanese | trans-title = Oricon Week Album Ranking October 14, 2019-October 20, 2019 11th-20th | access-date = 24 July 2021}}</ref> 

In the July 30, 2017 edition of the Chunichi Sport, it was mentioned that on July 29, 2017, a fan meeting was held at the 9th floor of the Tokai Radio Headquarters in Nagoya to celebrate what would have been the 50th birthday of Yukiko Okada in August 2017.  Entitled "Sing again! Yukko!", this was organized by 'Dotore Yamaguchi's Dokidoki Radio', '84/ Dr. Sato Yamaguchi in cooperation with Tokai Radio Magazine House, Pony Canyon, and Sun Music.  It was a time to remember the life of Yukiko Okada through pictures presentation and songs and displayed other memorabilia.
