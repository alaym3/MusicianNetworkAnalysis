Their distinct appearance is characterised by long, trailing [[kimono]], [[nihongami#geisha|traditional hairstyles]] and {{transl|ja|[[oshiroi]]}} make-up. Geisha entertain at parties known as {{transl|ja|ozashiki}}, often for the entertainment of wealthy clientele, as well as performing on stage and at festivals.

Modern geisha are not [[prostitute]]s. This misconception originated due to the conflation of Japanese [[oiran|courtesans]], [[oiran#modern oiran|modern day courtesan reenactors]], the extant {{transl|ja|tayū}}, and sex workers, who historically also wore kimono. The first female geisha appeared in 1751, with geisha before that time being male performers who entertained guests within the pleasure quarters; only later did the profession become mainly characterised by female workers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theculturetrip.com/asia/japan/articles/the-unknown-world-of-male-geishas/|title = Discover the Unknown World of Male Geishas|date = 5 January 2018}}</ref>{{efn|In fact, the first type of geisha in the yūkaku were men. Also called taiko mochi (drum bearers) or hōkan, they appeared in the 1660's as jesters and buffoons who would come to liven up parties held in the brothels. Some of them were cultured men who had squandered their fortunes in the yūkaku and were reduced to making their living within the confines of the quarters they knew so well. At this time, "geisha" was a masculine term, and the women who began to take on this profession were designated onna (female) geisha.{{sfn|Crihfield|1976|p=42–43}}}}

The arts that geisha perform are considered highly-developed and in some cases, unique throughout Japan to the world of geisha. For example, the Gion district of Kyoto is the only district wherein the {{transl|ja|[[kyo-mai]]}} style of [[Japanese traditional dance]] is taught. This style of dance is taught solely to the geisha within the district by the Inoue school, with the school's former head, [[List of Living National Treasures of Japan (performing arts)#Yachiyo Inoue|Inoue Yachiyo V]], having been classified as a "[[Living National Treasure (Japan)|Living National Treasure]]" by the Government of Japan, the highest artistic award attainable in the country, in 1955.{{sfn|Crihfield|1976|p=30}}

The word ''geisha'' consists of two [[kanji]]: {{nihongo3|meaning 'art'|[[wikt:芸|芸]]|gei}} and {{nihongo3|meaning 'person' or 'doer'|[[wikt:者|者]]|sha}}. The most literal translation of ''geisha'' in the [[English language]] would be "artist", "performing artist" or "artisan". Another regional term for geisha with a slightly different meaning is {{transl|ja|geiko}}, a term used to describe geisha in Western Japan, including Kyoto and Kanazawa. This term directly translates as "woman of art", and is part of the [[Kansai dialect#Kyoto|Kyoto dialect]] spoken by geisha in Kyoto and Western Japan.

Apprentice geisha are known as {{nihongo||舞妓|[[maiko]]}}, a term translating to "woman of dance". In some regions of Japan such as [[Tokyo]], apprentices are known instead as {{nihongo||半玉|han-gyoku}}, meaning "half-jewel", referring to one of the terms for a geisha's wages, "jewel money".<ref name="Masuda2003">{{harvnb|Masuda|2003}}</ref><ref name="Dalby2000">{{harvnb|Dalby|2000}}</ref> The two stages before an apprentice officially debuts as a {{transl|ja|maiko}} are known as {{nihongo3|"preparation" or "training"|仕込み|shikomi}}, followed by a period where apprentices are known as {{nihongo3|"learning by observation"|見習い|minarai}}.<ref name="Toki">{{cite web |title=The Life of a Geisha |url=https://www.toki.tokyo/blogt/2016/6/22/the-life-of-a-geisha |website=toki.tokyo |publisher=Toki Tokyo |access-date=1 June 2020}}</ref> During the {{transl|ja|minarai}} period, an apprentice will receive training through one specific teahouse, referred to as the {{transl|ja|minarai-jaya}}.

A number of terms are used to describe the profession and community that geisha both live and work in. Though each has its own distinct meaning and translation, some are used interchangeably to describe the geisha community on the whole, such as {{transl|ja|hanamachi}} and {{transl|ja|karyūkai}}.

* {{nihongo3|the "flower and willow world"|花柳界|Karyūkai}}: Before the decline and eventual disappearance of {{transl|ja|oiran}}, this term referred to the entertainment districts (the "world") of both geisha and courtesans, with {{transl|ja|oiran}} acting as the "flowers", ostensibly for their beautiful and showy appearance, and geisha being the subtler "willows".{{sfn|Downer|2003|p=5–6}}
* {{nihongo3|"flower town"|花街|[[Hanamachi]]}}: The district where a geisha works, is affiliated, and potentially lives. Geisha generally do not work outside of their {{transl|ja|hanamachi}}, though customers may call them for special occasions in other districts, or on excursions – however far away – to places outside the {{transl|ja|karyūkai}}. Engagements not held in licensed restaurants, teahouses, or a geisha's own {{transl|ja|hanamachi}} are known as {{transl|ja|tōde}}, "distant outings".{{sfn|Dalby|2000|p=204}}
* {{nihongo3|"flower towns"|花街|Kagai}}: An alternative term for the districts in which geisha live and work; interchangeable with {{transl|ja|karyūkai}}.

==History==
===Origins===
In the early stages of [[Japanese history]], {{transl|ja|saburuko}} (serving girls) were mostly wandering girls whose families had been displaced by war. Some of these {{transl|ja|saburuko}} girls offered sexual services for money while others with a better education made a living by entertaining at high-class social gatherings.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

After the imperial court moved the capital to [[Heian-kyō]] (Kyoto) in [[Heian period#History|794]], aspects of now-traditional Japanese art forms and [[Heian period#beauty|aesthetic ideals]] began to develop, which would later contribute to the conditions under which the geisha profession emerged.<ref name=Gal2003>{{harvnb|Gallagher|2003}}</ref> Skilled female performers, such as {{transl|ja|[[shirabyōshi]]}} dancers, thrived under the Imperial court, creating the traditions of female dance and performance that would later lead to both the development of geisha and [[kabuki]] actors.

During the Heian period, ideals surrounding relationships with women, sexual or otherwise, did not emphasise fidelity, with marriage within the Heian court considered a relatively casual arrangement. Men were not constrained to be faithful to their wives,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/05/16/the-rise-of-the-geisha-photos-from-19th-20th-century-show-the-japanese-entertainers/ |title=The Rise of the Geisha - photos from 19th & 20th century show the Japanese entertainers |first=Neil |last=Patrick |date=16 May 2016 |website=The Vintage News |access-date=6 November 2017 }}</ref> with the ideal wife instead being a modest mother who managed the affairs of the house, following [[confucian view of marriage|Confucian customs]] wherein love had secondary importance to the other roles a wife fulfilled within the marriage. As such, courtesans – who provided not only sexual enjoyment, but also romantic attachment and artistic entertainment – were seen as both an outlet for men, and common companions. Though geisha would not develop until the 1800s, the use and status of courtesans as artistic and romantic entertainers was a tradition that geisha would later come to employ, with the development of courtesan artforms leading the way for geisha to later develop.

Walled-in pleasure quarters known as {{nihongo||遊廓/遊郭|[[yūkaku]]}} were built in the 16th century,<ref>{{cite web |title=History of geisha |url=http://www.japan-zone.com/culture/geisha.shtml |website=Japan Zone |access-date=18 June 2010}}</ref> with the [[Tokugawa shogunate|shogunate]] designating prostitution illegal to practice outside of these "pleasure quarters" in 1617.<ref name="Downer2006"/> Within the pleasure quarters, {{nihongo3|"[women] of pleasure"|遊女|yūjo}} – a term used to refer to prostitutes as a whole – were [[prostitution in Japan#shogunate era|classified and licensed]], the upper echelons of which were referred to as {{transl|ja|"oiran"}}, a category with its own internal ranks, the highest of which being the {{transl|ja|tayū}}.

Though women in the lower ranks of {{transl|ja|yūjo}} did not provide as much artistic entertainment as they did sexual, {{transl|ja|oiran}}, whilst still prostitutes, also included the traditional arts as a key aspect of their entertainment, their practice of which differed considerably from those of geisha. As {{transl|ja|oiran}} were considered to be low-ranking members of the nobility, the instruments they played and the songs they sang were often confined to those considered "respectable" enough for the upper classes. This typically meant that {{transl|ja|oiran}} sang long, traditional ballads ({{transl|ja|[[nagauta]]}} – lit., "long songs"), and played instruments such as the {{transl|ja|kokyū}} (a type of bowed {{transl|ja|shamisen}}) and the {{transl|ja|[[koto (instrument)|koto]]}} (a 13-stringed harp).

However, some {{transl|ja|yūjo}} also performed theatrical plays, dances and skits; one such person was [[Izumo no Okuni]], whose theatrical performances on the dry riverbed of the [[Kamo River]] are considered to be the beginnings of [[kabuki]] theatre.<ref name="Downer2006"/>

===18th century emergence of the geisha===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Beauty - Gion Seitoku.jpg|thumb|Ukiyo-e scroll depicting a Gion geisha, 1800-1833]]
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - A Kyoto Geisha - Yamaguchi Soken.jpg|thumb|Ukiyo-e print by Yamaguchi Soken of a Kyoto geisha]]
Following their inception by the shogunate in the 17th century, the pleasure quarters quickly became popular entertainment centres that developed their own additional forms of entertainment outside of sex. The highly accomplished courtesans of these districts entertained their clients by dancing, singing, and playing music. Some were renowned poets and [[calligraphy|calligraphers]] as well; the development of the cultural arts of the pleasure quarters led to the rise in {{transl|ja|oiran}} being considered to be the celebrities of their day.

Around the turn of the 18th century, the first geisha, or forerunners of geisha, performing for guests of the pleasure quarters began to appear; these entertainers, who provided song and dance, developed from a number of sources. Some geisha, who were something of travelling entertainers going from party to party, were men, who would entertain the customers of courtesans through song and dance.<ref name="Downer2006"/> At the same time, the forerunners of female geisha, the teenage {{transl|ja|odoriko}} ("dancing girls"),{{sfn|Fujomoto|1917|p=18}} developed, trained and hired as chaste dancers-for-hire within these pleasure quarters. Further still, some courtesans, whose contracts within the pleasure quarters had ended, chose to stay on to provide musical entertainment to guests, making use of the skills they had formerly developed as part of their job.{{citation needed|reason=I'll have to dig out the source I have for this later.|date=August 2021}}

In the 1680s, {{transl|ja|odoriko}} had become popular entertainers and were often paid to perform in the private homes of upper-class samurai;{{sfn|Seigle|1993|p=171}} by the early 18th century, many of these {{transl|ja|odoriko}} had also begun offering sexual services as well as chaste performances. Performers who were no longer teenagers (and could no longer style themselves {{transl|ja|odoriko}})<ref>{{cite web |title=Osaka Prints: Glossary |first=J. |last=Fiorillo |url=http://www.osakaprints.com/content/information/glossary.htm |quote=''geiko'': "Arts child", originally dancing girls who were too young to be called geisha but too old (more than twenty years of age) to be called {{transl|ja|odoriko}}. {{transl|ja|"Geiko"}} was the pronunciation used in the Kamigata region. Some {{transl|ja|geiko}} operated as illegal prostitutes. By the 19th century the term became synonymous with geisha.}}</ref> adopted other titles in order to continue working – with one being "geisha", after the male entertainers of the time.

The first woman known to have called herself "geisha" was a prostitute from [[Fukagawa (Tokyo)|Fukagawa]], roughly around 1750,{{sfn|Tiefenbrun|2003|p=32}} who had become a skilled singer and {{transl|ja|[[shamisen]]}} player. The geisha, who took the name of Kikuya, became an immediate success, bringing greater popularity to the idea of female geisha.{{efn|Appendix II a timeline of geisha and related history; Gallagher says that "Kiku" from the Fukugawa district founded the profession in 1750, and that by 1753 one hundred {{transl|ja|odoriko}} were consigned to Yoshiwara, which licensed (female) geisha in 1761.{{sfn|Gallagher|2003|p=252}}}} In the next two decades, female geisha became well known for their talents as entertainers in their own right; these performers often worked in the same establishments as male geisha.{{sfn|Seigle|1993|p=172–174}}

===Geisha in the 19th century to present day===
[[File:Tokyo Geisha with Shamisen c1870s,.jpg|thumb|Tokyo geisha with {{transl|ja|shamisen}}, {{circa|1870}}s]]
By 1800, the profession of geisha was understood to be almost entirely female, and was established as a distinct role in its own right; however, geisha were, throughout various points within the [[Edo period]], unable to work outside of the pleasure quarters, being affected by reforms aimed at either limiting or shutting down the pleasure quarters. These reforms were often inconsistent, and were repealed at various times.

Once established as an independent profession, a number of edicts were then introduced in order to protect the business of courtesans and separate the two professions. Geisha were firstly forbidden from selling sex, though many continued to do so; if a courtesan accused a geisha of stealing her customers and business of sex and entertainment, an official investigation was opened, with the potential for a geisha to lose her right to practice the profession. Geisha were also forbidden from wearing particularly flashy hairpins or kimono, both of which were hallmarks of higher-ranking courtesans, who were considered to be a part of the upper classes.<ref name=Dalby2000/>

Despite their official status as lower-class entertainers, geisha continued to grow in popularity. While courtesans existed to meet the needs of upper-class men (who could not respectably be seen to visit a lower-class prostitute) and prostitutes met the sexual needs of lower-class men, this left a gap of skilled and refined entertainers for the emerging merchant classes, who, though wealthy, were unable to access courtesans due to their social class. The status of courtesans as celebrities and arbiters of fashion had also waned considerably; the art forms they practiced had become stiffly-cherished relics of the upper classes, as had their manner of speech and their increasingly gaudy appearance. In contrast, {{transl|ja|machi geisha}} (lit., "town geisha") had begun to successfully establish themselves as worldly, cutting-edge entertainers, more artistically daring than their cloistered, indentured cousins, and able to come and go and dress as they pleased.

This popularity was then increased by the introduction of various laws intended to clamp down on and regulate the lower classes – in particular, the emerging merchant classes who had established themselves as the premiere patrons of geisha. Both had, over time, come to hold much of the purchasing power within Japan, with their status as lower class allowing them a degree of freedom in their tastes of dress and entertainment, in contrast to upper class families who had little choice but to appear in a manner deemed respectable to their status. 

As the tastes of the merchant classes for kabuki and geisha became widely popular, laws introduced to effectively neuter the appearances and tastes of geisha and their customers were passed. This, however, had the adverse effect of leading to the rise in popularity of more refined and subversive [[iki (aesthetic ideal)|aesthetical senses]] within those classes, further alienating courtesans and their patrons from popularity and contemporary taste; the introduction of laws on dress only furthered the popularity of geisha as refined and fashionable companions for men. As a result, over time, courtesans of both higher and lower ranks began to fall out of fashion, seen as gaudy and old-fashioned. 

By the 1830s, geisha were considered to be the premiere fashion and style icons in Japanese society, and were emulated by women of the time.{{sfn|Dalby|2008|p=74}} Many fashion trends started by geisha soon became widely popular, with some continuing to this day; the wearing of {{transl|ja|[[haori]]}} by women, for example, was first started by geisha from the Tokyo {{transl|ja|hanamachi}} of Fukagawa in the early 1800s.

There were considered to be many classifications and ranks of geisha, though some were colloquial or closer to a tongue-in-cheek nicknames than an official ranking. Some geisha would sleep with their customers, whereas others would not, leading to distinctions such as {{transl|ja|'kuruwa'}} geisha – a geisha who slept with customers as well as entertaining them through performing arts – {{transl|ja|'yujō'}} ("prostitute") and {{transl|ja|'jorō'}} ("whore") geisha, whose only entertainment for male customers was sex, and {{transl|ja|'machi'}} geisha, who did not, officially and in reality, sleep with customers at all.{{sfn|Ohnuki-Tierney|2002|p=347}}

By the end of the 19th century, courtesans no longer held the celebrity status they once did.{{efn|"Unlike the previous two hundred years, when artists... praised the Yoshiwara [Edo brothel district] as an environment of both cultural sophistication and sexual liberation, however, 19th-century artists... described it in more critical, cynical terms. Though the precise reasons for this change in the public's perception of the Yoshiwara during the 19th century can only be speculated, the decline was as precipitous as it was undeniable. By the early 20th century, the aura of dignity and élan the courtesans had once exuded was all but lost, and these women, many of whom suffered from venereal disease, appeared more like sexual slaves than celebrities.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eichman |first1=Shawn | first2 = Stephen | last2 = Salel |title=Tongue in Cheek: Erotic Art of 19th Century Japan |url=http://shunga.honolulumuseum.org/2013/index.php?status=complete&page=102 |publisher=The Honolulu Museum of Art |access-date=30 May 2020 |format=Online exhibition}}</ref>}} This trend would continue until the [[Prostitution Prevention Law|criminalisation of prostitution in Japan]] in 1956.

====Pre-war and wartime geisha====
[[World War II]] brought lasting change to the geisha profession; before the war, geisha numbers, despite seeing competition from {{transl|ja|jokyū}} (café girls, the precursor to the [[Host and hostess clubs|bar hostess]] profession in Japan), had been as high as 80,000,<ref name=Dalby2000/>{{rp|84|q="[Bar graph displaying {{transl|ja|jokyū}} and geisha numbers between 1929 to 1934] The rise of the {{transl|ja|jokyū}} and the fall of the geisha. Source: Naimushō Keisatsu Torishimari Tokei [Department of the Interior, Police Regulation Statistics]."}}{{sfn|Dougill|2006|p=182}} however, following the closure of all geisha districts in 1944, mostly all geisha had been conscripted into the war effort proper, with many finding work in factories or elsewhere through customers and patrons.

Though geisha returned to the {{transl|ja|karyūkai}} relatively quickly after the war, many had decided to stay on in their wartime jobs, considering it to be a more stable form of employment. Both during and after the war, the geisha name lost some status, as some prostitutes began referring to themselves as "[[#"Geisha (Gee-sha) girls"|geisha girls]]" to members of the American military occupying Japan.<ref name=Dalby2000/>

====Post-war geisha====
In 1945, the {{transl|ja|karyūkai}} saw restrictions on its practices lifted with teahouses, bars, and geisha houses ({{transl|ja|okiya}}) allowed to open again. Though many geisha did not return to the {{transl|ja|hanamachi}} after the war, it was evident that working as a geisha was still considered to be a lucrative and viable career, with numbers increasing quickly. The vast majority of geisha after the war were aged 20–24, as many retired in their mid-twenties after [[#Danna partnership|finding a patron]] – a trend carried over from the pre-war {{transl|ja|karyūkai}}:

<blockquote>'I showed the mother of the Yamabuki [{{transl|ja|okiya}}, in 1975] some statistics on the age distribution of the geisha population in the 1920s. She remarked on the big dip in figures when women reached the age of twenty-five. "In those days, when you found yourself a patron you could stop working. If you were lucky you would be set up in your own apartment and have a life of leisure, taking lessons when you wanted to for your own enjoyment ... I think it's pretty unusual nowadays for a geisha to stop working when she gets a patron."'<ref name=Dalby2000/>{{rp|202-203|q=[Graph titled "Geisha Ages"] Distribution of geisha according to age. In the 1920s, more than half the geisha population retired from the profession at age twenty-four or twenty-five. This trend was still evident in 1947."}}</blockquote>

The status of geisha in Japanese society also changed drastically after the war. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, much discussion had taken place surrounding the status of geisha in a rapidly-Westernising Japanese society. Some geisha had begun to experiment with wearing Western clothing to engagements, learning Western-style dancing, and serving cocktails to customers instead of sake. The image of a "modern" pre-war geisha had been viewed by some as unprofessional and a betrayal of the profession's image, but as a necessary change and an obvious evolution by others. However, the incumbent pressures of the war rapidly turned the tide against Westernisation, leading to an effective abandonment of most radical "Western-style" geisha experiments.{{efn|Despite this, a few changes - such as the standardisation of a geisha's fees - did withstand, and remain in place to this day.<ref name=Dalby2000/>}}

After the war, geisha unanimously returned to wearing kimono and practicing the traditional arts, abandoning all experimental geisha styles of appearance and entertainment. This, however, led to the final blow for the profession's reputation as fashionable in wider society; though the geisha did not experience the rapid decline and eventual death that courtesans had experienced in the previous century, they were instead rendered as "protectors of tradition" in favour of preserving the image geisha had cultivated over time.<ref name=Dalby2000/>

Nonetheless, in the decades after the war, the profession's practices still underwent some changes. Following the introduction of the Prostitution Prevention Law in 1956, geisha benefited from the official criminalisation of practices such as {{transl|ja|[[#Mizuage|mizuage]]}}, a practice that had at times been undertaken coercively or through force by some {{transl|ja|maiko}} in mostly pre-war Japan. Despite this, the [[#Geisha and prostitution|misconception]] of geisha being on some level prostitutes and of {{transl|ja|mizuage}} being a common practice continues, inaccurately, to this day.{{sfn|Gallagher|2003|p=135}}

<blockquote>After Japan lost the war, geisha dispersed and the profession was in shambles. When they regrouped during the Occupation and began to flourish in the 1960s during Japan's postwar economic boom, the geisha world changed. In modern Japan, girls are not sold into indentured service. Nowadays, a geisha's sex life is her private affair.<ref name="Dalby Do They">{{Cite web |url=http://www.lizadalby.com/LD/ng_geisha_sex.html |title=Do They or Don't They |access-date=12 January 2010 |last=Dalby |first=Liza |website=lizadalby.com |quote=The question always comes up...just how 'available' is a geisha? ... There is no simple answer.}}</ref></blockquote>

From the 1930s onwards, the rise of the {{transl|ja|jokyū}} bar hostess began to overshadow geisha as the premiere profession of entertainment at parties and outings for men.{{sfn|Dalby|2000|p=84}} In 1959, the [[Ogden Standard Examiner|Standard-Examiner]] reported the plight of geisha in an article written for the magazine {{transl|ja|[[Bungeishunjū (magazine)|Bungei Shunju]]}} by Japanese businessman [[Tsûsai Sugawara]]. Sugawara stated that girls now "prefer[red] to become dancers, models, and cabaret and bar hostesses rather than start [the] training in music and dancing at the age of seven or eight" necessary to become geisha at the time.<ref>{{cite news |title=Goodby to Geisha Girl, She's on Her Way Out | page = 4 |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/ogden-standard-examiner-sep-27-1959-p-4 |url-access= subscription |work=The Ogden Standard-Examiner |location=Ogden, Utah |date=27 September 1959 |access-date=16 October 2019}}</ref>

Compulsory education laws passed in the 1960s effectively shortened the period of training for geisha apprentices, as girls could no longer be taken on at a young age to be trained throughout their teenage years. This led to a decline in women entering the profession, as most {{transl|ja|okiya}} required a recruit to be at least somewhat competent and trained in the arts she would later go on to use as a geisha;<ref name="bowing out">{{cite news |last=Taubman |first=Howard |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/06/12/archives/geisha-tradition-is-bowing-out-in-japan-geishas-fighting-losing.html |title=Geisha Tradition Is Bowing Out in Japan; Geishas Fighting Losing Battle Against New Trends in Japan |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 12, 1968 |page=49 |access-date=March 16, 2011}}</ref> by about 1975, {{transl|ja|okiya}} mothers in Kyoto began accepting both recruits from different areas of Japan in larger numbers, and recruits with little to no previous experience in the traditional arts.

By 1975, the average age of a geisha in the {{transl|ja|Ponto-chō}} district of Kyoto was roughly 39, with the vast majority being aged 35–49.<ref name=Dalby2000/> The population of geisha at this time was also surprisingly high, roughly equivalent to the numbers of young women within the profession; geisha no longer retired young when they found a patron, and were less likely than other women of the same age to have both children and an extended family to support them. In 1989, it was reported in the [[New York Times]] that there were an estimated 600-700 geisha left throughout the whole of Japan.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Weisman |first1=Steven R. |title=Ex-Geisha Accuses Uno Of a Dangerous Liaison |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/10/world/ex-geisha-accuses-uno-of-a-dangerous-liaison.html |access-date=3 June 2020 |work=The New York Times }}</ref>

====Present-day geisha====

Modern geisha mostly still live in {{transl|ja|okiya}} they are affiliated with, particularly during their apprenticeship, and are legally required to be registered to one, though they may not live there every day. Many experienced geisha are successful enough to choose to live independently, though living independently is more common in some geisha districts – such as those in Tokyo – than others.

Geisha are often hired to attend parties and gatherings, traditionally at tea houses or traditional Japanese restaurants ({{transl|ja|ryōtei}}).<ref name="kalman">{{harvnb|Kalman|1989}}</ref> The charge for a geisha's time, previously determined by [[incense clock#stick incense clocks|the time it took to burn one incense stick]] (known as {{nihongo3|"incense stick fee"|線香代|senkōdai}} or {{nihongo3|"jewel fee"|玉代|gyokudai}}, was modernised during the 19th century to a flat fee charged per hour.<ref name=Dalby2000/> In Kyoto, the terms {{nihongo||お花|ohana}} and {{nihongo||花代|hanadai}} (both meaning "flower fees") are used instead as part of the Kyoto dialect. However, appointments and arrangements are still made by the mother of the house (the {{transl|ja|okasan}}) through the official registry office ({{nihongo||検番|"kenban"}}), which keeps a record of both the appointments taken by a geisha and her schedule.

In modern Japan, geisha and their apprentices are a rarer sight outside of the {{transl|ja|hanamachi}} or {{nihongo3|"tea house district", often referred to as "entertainment district"|茶屋街|chayagai}}; most sightings of geisha and {{transl|ja|maiko}} in and around cities such as Kyoto are actually tourists who pay a fee to be dressed up as either a {{transl|ja|maiko}} or geisha for the day, a practice known as {{transl|ja|"henshin"}}.<ref name="Reuters Geisha">{{cite web|title=Modern-day geisha triumphs in closed, traditional world|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUST23171020080423?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0|last=Lies|first=Elaine|date=23 April 2008|website=Reuters|access-date=2 June 2009}}</ref>{{efn|{{transl|ja|Henshin}} studios are required to dress paying customers inaccurately if they wish to appear in costume in public, so that tourists and working {{transl|ja|maiko}} and geisha are visually distinct from one another.}}

Over time the number of geisha has declined, despite the efforts of those within the profession. Factors include the nature of the economy, declining interest in the traditional arts, the exclusive and closed-off nature of the {{transl|ja|karyūkai}}, and the expense of being entertained by geisha.{{efn|"An economic downturn in the 1990s forced businessmen to cut back on entertainment expenses, while high-profile scandals in recent years have made politicians eschew excessive spending. A dinner can cost around 80,000 yen (US$1,058) per head, depending on the venue and the number of geishas present. But even before the 90s, men were steadily giving up on late-night parties at {{transl|ja|ryotei}}, restaurants with traditional straw-mat tatami rooms where geisha entertain, in favour of the modern comforts of hostess bars and karaoke rooms."<ref name=Fuj07>{{cite news |title=World's oldest geisha looks to future to preserve past |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-geisha-idUST22760820071203 |date=3 December 2007 |first=Chisa |last=Fujioka|publisher=Reuters |access-date=12 November 2021}}</ref>}} The number of {{transl|ja|maiko}} and geisha in Kyoto fell from 76 and 548 in 1965 respectively to just 71 and 202 in 2006{{r|Dalby Geisha Notes|q=[Graph titled "change in the population of {{transl|ja|geiko}} and {{transl|ja|maiko}} in Kyoto"]}} as a result.

However, following the advent of wider accessibility to the internet from the mid-2000s onwards, a greater number of recruits have decided to join the profession with no existing ties to the {{transl|ja|karyūkai}} through watching online documentaries and reading websites set up by {{transl|ja|okiya}} to promote their business;<ref name="Reuters Geisha"/> documentary pieces commonly inspire young women to join the profession, such as the geisha Satsuki, who later became the most popular geisha in Gion for a seven-year period:

<blockquote>[Geisha] Satsuki first took an interest in the {{transl|ja|kagai}} while a middle school student in Osaka, at around the age of 14, after seeing a documentary about a {{transl|ja|maiko}}'s training. "I already had heard of {{transl|ja|maiko}}, but it was when I saw the documentary that I thought – I want to do that."<ref>{{cite web |author1=Buzzfeed Japan |title=トップ芸妓が語る仕事の流儀と淡い恋 「いまから思うと好きやったんかな？」 |url=https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20181222-00010002-bfj-soci&p=1 |website=headlines.yahoo.co.jp |publisher=Yahoo Japan |access-date=20 March 2020 |ref=Satsuki |language=ja}}</ref></blockquote>

In recent years, a growing number of geisha have complained to the authorities about being pursued and harassed by groups of tourists keen to take their photograph when out walking. As a result, tourists in Kyoto have been warned not to harass geisha on the streets, with local residents of the city and businesses in the areas surrounding the {{transl|ja|hanamachi}} of Kyoto launching patrols throughout Gion in order to prevent tourists from doing so.<ref>{{cite news|last=Demetriou|first=Danielle|date=30 December 2008|title=Tourists warned to stop 'harassing' Kyoto's geisha|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/4018220/Tourists-warned-to-stop-harassing-Kyotos-geisha.html|access-date=22 September 2018}}</ref>

A geisha's appearance changes symbolically throughout her career, representing her training and seniority. These constitute changes in hairstyle, hair accessories, and kimono style.

===Makeup===

Notice the green pin on the mid-left known as {{transl|ja|"tsunagi-dango"}}: this identifies her as a {{transl|ja|maiko}} of Gion Kobu under 18.]]
Both {{transl|ja|maiko}} and geisha wear traditional white foundation known as {{transl|ja|oshiroi}}; in the past, this white makeup - formerly made with [[lead]] - would have illuminated the face of a geisha when the only lighting available was that of [[candle|candlelight]]. {{transl|ja|Oshiroi}} is worn with red and black eye and eyebrow makeup, red lips and light pink blusher. Both {{transl|ja|maiko}} and geisha underpaint their lips with a red lipstick known as {{transl|ja|beni}}, but first-year apprentice geisha paint only the lower lip, and wear less black around the eyes and eyebrows than senior {{transl|ja|maiko}}. Younger apprentices may also paint their eyebrows slightly shorter or rounder to emphasise a youthful appearance.<ref name=Pra2006>{{harvnb|Prasso|2006}}</ref> {{transl|ja|Maiko}} wear noticeably more blush – known as {{transl|ja|tonoko}} – than geisha.<ref name=Tetsuo>{{harvnb|Tetsuo|2001|p=66–71}}</ref> Young apprentices may have the mother of the house or their "older sister" mentors help them apply makeup.

Geisha wear more black around the eyes and eyebrows than {{transl|ja|maiko}}, and older geisha tend only to wear a full face of traditional white makeup during stage performances or on special occasions; older geisha generally stop wearing {{transl|ja|oshiroi}} around the same time they stop wearing {{transl|ja|hikizuri}} to parties.

For a short period before becoming a geisha, {{transl|ja|maiko}} in some geisha districts [[Ohaguro|colour their teeth black]], usually accompanied by wearing the {{transl|ja|sakkō}} hairstyle and a decorated black formal kimono. Teeth blackening was once a common practice amongst married women in Japan and the imperial court in earlier times, but is now an extremely uncommon practice.

===Dress===

{{further|Maiko#Appearance}}
[[File:Maiko and geisha back.jpg|thumb|alt=A {{transl|ja|maiko}} (on the left) and a geisha (on the right) facing away from the camera, sat on a tatami mat.|A senior {{transl|ja|maiko}} (left) wearing a long {{transl|ja|darari obi}} and a geisha (right) wearing an {{transl|ja|obi}} in the {{transl|ja|taiko-musubi}} style]]
Geisha and {{transl|ja|maiko}} always wear kimono while working, and typically wear kimono outside of work. However, the type of kimono varies based on age, occasion, region and season of the year.

===={{transl|ja|Maiko}}====
Both {{transl|ja|maiko}} and geisha wear the collar on their kimono relatively far back, accentuating (for {{transl|ja|maiko}}) the red collar of the underkimono ({{transl|ja|juban}}), and displaying (for both) the two or three stripes of bare skin ({{transl|ja|eri-ashi}} and {{transl|ja|sanbon-ashi}} respectively) left just underneath the hairline when wearing {{transl|ja|oshiroi}}.

Apprentice geisha wear kimono known as {{transl|ja|[[Kimono#Hikizuri|hikizuri]]}}. Geisha also wear {{transl|ja|hikizuri}}; however, {{transl|ja|maiko}} wear a variety with {{transl|ja|furisode}}-style sleeves, with a tuck sewn into either sleeve, and a tuck sewn into each shoulder. {{transl|ja|Maiko hikizuri}} tend to be colourful and highly decorated, often featuring a design that continues inside the kimono's hem.

The style of this kimono varies throughout different regions; apprentices in Kyoto tend to wear large but sparsely-placed motifs, whereas apprentices elsewhere appear in kimono similar to a regular {{transl|ja|furisode}}, with small, busy patterns that cover a greater area.

Apprentices wear long, formal {{transl|ja|[[obi (sash)#Women's obi types|obi]]}}. For apprentices in Kyoto this is almost always a {{transl|ja|darari}} (lit., "dangling") {{transl|ja|obi}}, a type of {{transl|ja|obi}} roughly {{convert|6|m}} long, but elsewhere may be the shorter and narrower {{transl|ja|fukuro obi}}. {{transl|ja|Darari obi}} are always worn in a knot showing off the length, whereas apprentices elsewhere wear {{transl|ja|fukura-suzume}} and {{transl|ja|han-dara}} (lit., "half-dangling") knots. When wearing casual kimono in off-duty settings, an apprentice may still wear a {{transl|ja|nagoya obi}}, even with a {{transl|ja|[[Kimono#Yukata|yukata]]}}.

Apprentices wear either {{transl|ja|[[zōri]]}} or {{transl|ja|[[okobo]]}} with their kimono, with {{transl|ja|okobo}} being worn (in Kyoto at least) with all formal kimono.<ref name="Gal2003"/> For training and in everyday life, {{transl|ja|zōri}} are worn, even when wearing casual short-sleeved kimono such as {{transl|ja|[[Kimono#Komon|komon]]}} and {{transl|ja|yukata}}.

====Geisha====
Geisha wear kimono more subdued in pattern and colour than both regular kimono, and the kimono worn by apprentice geisha. A geisha always wears a short-sleeved kimono, regardless of occasion, formality, or even her age; however, not all geisha wear the {{transl|ja|hikizuri}} type of kimono, as older geisha wear regular formal kimono – with no trailing skirt, dipping collar or offset sleeves – to engagements. Regional geisha tend to have greater similarities with fellow geisha across the country in terms of appearance.

Geisha wear their {{transl|ja|obi}} in the {{transl|ja|nijuudaiko musubi}} style – a {{transl|ja|taiko musubi}} (drum knot) tied with a {{transl|ja|fukuro obi}}; geisha from Tokyo and Kanazawa also wear their {{transl|ja|obi}} in the {{transl|ja|yanagi musubi}} (willow knot) style and the {{transl|ja|tsunodashi musubi}} style. Though geisha may wear {{transl|ja|hakata ori obi}} in the summer months, geisha from Fukuoka – where the fabric originates from – may wear it the entire year.

Geisha exclusively wear solid white {{transl|ja|han-eri}}, and wear either {{transl|ja|geta}} or {{transl|ja|zōri}} when wearing kimono.

The hairstyles of geisha have varied throughout history. During the 17th century, the {{transl|ja|shimada}} hairstyle developed, which became the basis for the hairstyles worn by both geisha and {{transl|ja|maiko}}. When the profession of geisha first came into existence, dress edicts prevented geisha from wearing the dramatic hairstyles worn by courtesans, leading to the subdued nature of most geisha hairstyles.

Following World War II, many of the hairstylists who had previously served the {{transl|ja|karyūkai}} no longer operated, leading to the redevelopment of hairstyles for geisha and {{transl|ja|maiko}}. Geisha, unable to reliably book in with a hairstylist once a week to maintain their hair, began to wear human hair wigs in the {{transl|ja|shimada}} style that required restyling far less. The hairstyles of {{transl|ja|maiko}}, still utilising the apprentice's own hair, became wider, placed higher upon the head, and shorter in length.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/a-week-in-the-life-of-koaki-apprentice-geisha--schooled-in-the-arts-of-pleasure-1170322.html |title=A Week in the Life of: Koaki, Apprentice Geisha – Schooled in the arts of pleasure |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=8 August 1998}}</ref>

There are five different hairstyles that a {{transl|ja|maiko}} wears, which mark the different stages of her apprenticeship. The {{transl|ja|nihongami}} hairstyle with {{transl|ja|kanzashi}} hair ornaments are most closely associated with {{transl|ja|maiko}},<ref name=Tetsuo/> who spend hours each week at the hairdresser and sleep on special pillows ({{transl|ja|takamakura}}) to preserve the elaborate styling.<ref name="McCurry" />{{rp|3}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Dressing as a Geisha|url=http://money.howstuffworks.com/geisha4.htm|last=Layton|first=J.|website=howstuffworks.com|date=8 December 2005}}</ref> {{transl|ja|Maiko}} can develop a bald spot on their crown caused by the stress of wearing these hairstyles almost every day, but in the present day, this is less likely to happen due to the later age at which {{transl|ja|maiko}} begin their apprenticeship. {{transl|ja|Maiko}} in certain districts of Kyoto may also wear additional, differing hairstyles in the run up to graduating as a geisha.

In the present day, geisha wear a variety of the {{transl|ja|shimada}} known as the {{transl|ja|chū taka shimada}} – a flattened, sleeker version of the {{transl|ja|bunkin taka shimada}} worn as a bridal wig in traditional weddings. Though geisha also wear this hairstyle as a wig, it is usually shaped specifically to their face by a wig stylist. Older geisha may wear the {{transl|ja|tsubushi taka shimada}} style on special occasions, featuring a flatter "bun" ({{transl|ja|mage}}) than both the {{transl|ja|bunkin taka shimada}} and {{transl|ja|chū taka shimada}} styles.

Both the hairstyles of {{transl|ja|maiko}} and geisha are decorated with hair combs and hairpins ({{transl|ja|kanzashi}}), with geisha wearing far fewer {{transl|ja|kanzashi}} than {{transl|ja|maiko}}. The style and colour of hair accessories worn with some {{transl|ja|maiko}} hairstyles can signify the stage of an apprentice's training. Typical combs and hairpins may be made of tortoiseshell or mock-tortoiseshell, gold, silver and semi-precious stones such as jade and coral.

==Traditional performances==
[[File:Dancing geisha, Gion, Kyoto - August 30, 2007.jpg|thumb|Geisha are skilled artists, trained in and performing music and dance.]]
[[File:Two geishas playing shamisen.jpg|thumb|Geisha Komomo and Mameyoshi from Gion Kobu playing {{transl|ja|shamisen}}]]
Geisha entertain their guests with a combination of both their hostessing and conversational skills, and their skills in traditional Japanese art forms of dance, music and singing. Before deciding to begin a career as a geisha, new recruits are generally expected to have an interest in the arts, as well as some experience; however, as geisha numbers have fallen throughout the decades, this is no longer a strict prerequisite. Some {{transl|ja|okiya}} will take on recruits with no previous experience, with some young geisha, despite having existing experience, expected to begin their lessons from the beginning.<ref name=Dalby2000/>{{rp|189|q=A few [recruits] who have already become geisha are obliged to start lessons from the very beginning}}

The style of dance practiced by geisha today evolved from dance styles used in both {{transl|ja|[[nōh]]}} and kabuki theatre. Over time, the more exaggerated theatrical styles evolved into the subtle and more stylised form of dancing used today; despite the difference, elements of traditional Japanese dance, such as the use of gestures to tell a story and the symbolism used to represent this, run throughout both as a common feature.<ref name="Downer2006">{{harvnb|Downer|2006}}</ref>

These dances are accompanied by traditional Japanese music. The primary instrument used by geisha to accompany dance is the {{transl|jan|shamisen}}, a banjo-like three-stringed instrument played with a [[plectrum#non-western instruments|plectrum]]. Originating in China as the {{transl|zh|[[sanxian]]}}, it was introduced to Japan first through Korea, and then the [[Ryukyu Islands|Ryukyu]] Islands in the 1560s, obtaining its current form within a century. The {{transl|ja|shamisen}} soon became the mainstay instrument of geisha entertainment in the 1750s.{{sfn|Dalby|2000|p=258–259}}<ref name="Maske">{{harvnb|Maske|2004|p=104}}</ref> It is described as having a distinct and melancholic sound, with traditional {{transl|ja|shamisen}} music using only [[minor third]]s and sixths in its composition.<ref name="Maske"/>

All geisha must learn to play the {{transl|ja|shamisen}}, alongside additional instruments that often accompany the {{transl|ja|shamisen}}, such as the {{transl|ja|[[tsuzumi|ko-tsuzumi]]}} (small shoulder drum) and {{transl|ja|[[fue]]}} (flute), during their apprenticeship, as well as learning traditional Japanese dance; however, after graduation to geisha status, geisha are free to choose which art form they wish to pursue primarily. Geisha who pursue musicianship are known as {{nihongo3|"ground [seated, when playing instruments and singing] person"|地方|jikata}} geisha, whereas geisha who pursue dance are known as {{nihongo3|"standing person"|立方|tachikata}} geisha. Some geisha not only dance and play music, but also write poems, paint pictures, or compose music.<ref name="Downer2006"/>

===Public performances===
While traditionally geisha led a cloistered existence, in recent years they have become more publicly visible, and entertainment is available without requiring the traditional introduction and connections.

The most visible form of this are public dances, or {{transl|ja|odori}} (generally written in [[Historical kana orthography|traditional kana spelling]] as {{lang|ja|をどり}}, rather than modern {{lang|ja|おどり}}), featuring both {{transl|ja|maiko}} and geisha. All the Kyoto {{transl|ja|hanamachi}} hold these annually (mostly in spring, with one exclusively in autumn), dating to the [[Kyoto exhibition]] of 1872,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.intojapan.co.uk/festivals/maiko-dance.php |title=Maiko Dance |website=Into Japan | publisher = Into Japan Specialist Tours |access-date=26 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327131003/http://www.intojapan.co.uk/festivals/maiko-dance.php |archive-date=27 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and there are many performances, with tickets being inexpensive, ranging from around ￥1500 to ￥4500 – top-price tickets also include an optional tea ceremony (tea and {{transl|ja|[[wagashi]]}} served by {{transl|ja|maiko}}) before the performance.<ref name="geishadances">{{cite web |url=http://www.geishaofjapan.com/tourism/dances.html |title=Geisha dances |website=Geisha of Japan |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130102225341/http://www.geishaofjapan.com/tourism/dances.html |archive-date=2 January 2013}}</ref> Other {{transl|ja|hanamachi}} also hold public dances, including some in Tokyo, but have fewer performances.<ref name="geishadances"/>

==Training process==
[[File:Geisha, maiko, shikomi in Kyoto.jpg|thumb|Kyoto {{transl|ja|geiko}} Fumikazu with her {{transl|ja|minarai imōto}} Momokazu, and a {{transl|ja|shikomi}} from the Odamoto {{transl|ja|okiya}}]]
Before the 20th century, geisha began their training at a young age, around the age of six. In the present day this is no longer the case, and geisha usually debut as {{transl|ja|maiko}} around the age of 17 or 18. Labour laws stipulate that apprentices only join an {{transl|ja|okiya}} aged 18, although {{transl|ja|okiya}} in Kyoto are legally allowed to take on recruits at a younger age, 15–17.<ref name=Fuj07/>{{sfn|Prasso|2006|218}} Now, girls must graduate from middle school and then make the personal decision to train to become a geisha. Young women who wish to become geisha now most often begin their training after high school or even college. Many more women begin their careers in adulthood.<ref name=HitByPoorEconomy>{{cite news |last=Jones |first=N. |date=20 April 2007 |title=Japan's geisha hit by poor economy |newspaper=The Washington Times | url = https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/apr/19/20070419-103305-5994r/ |quote='Even the older sisters who became geisha as teenagers, they are [now] over 80 but still train every day'.... 'They hit the bottom a couple of years ago, but now more [university] students are interested in becoming geisha'.}}</ref>

Before debuting as a {{transl|ja|maiko}}, apprentices may live at the {{transl|ja|okiya}} as {{transl|ja|shikomi}} – essentially a trainee, learning all the necessary skills to become a {{transl|ja|maiko}}, as well as attending to the needs of the house and learning to live with her geisha sisters and within the {{transl|ja|karyūkai}}. By watching other geisha and learning from the mother of the house (known as the {{transl|ja|okā-san}} – lit., "mother"), apprentices learn how to speak with guests, the mannerisms necessary to be a geisha, and the traditions of the {{transl|ja|karyūkai}}. Apprentices also learn how to comfortably wear kimono.<ref name="tames-1993">{{harvnb|Tames|1993}}</ref><ref name="kalman"/>

Traditionally the {{transl|jan|shikomi}} stage of training lasted for years, and some girls were bonded to geisha houses as children. Daughters of geisha were often brought up as geisha themselves, usually as the successor ({{transl|ja|atotori}}, meaning "heir" or "heiress") or daughter-role{{clarify|reason=what does being brought up as the "daughter-role" mean?|date=June 2020}} ({{transl|ja|musume-bun}}) to the {{transl|ja|okiya}}. Successors, however, were not always blood relations. Nowadays, a girl is often a {{transl|ja|shikomi}} for up to a year.

A {{transl|ja|maiko}} is an apprentice and is therefore bonded under a contract to her {{transl|ja|okiya}}. The {{transl|ja|okiya}} will usually supply her with food, board, kimono, {{transl|ja|obi}}, and other tools of her trade, but a {{transl|ja|maiko}} may decide to fund everything herself from the beginning with either a loan or the help of an outside guarantor.<ref name=Dalby2000/> A {{transl|ja|maiko}}'s training is very expensive, and debts must be repaid over time with her earnings to either the {{transl|ja|okiya}} or her guarantor. This repayment may continue after graduation to geishahood, and only when her debts are settled can a geisha claim her entire wages and work independently (if loaning from the {{transl|ja|okiya}}). After this point she may chose to stay on living at her {{transl|ja|okiya}}, must still be affiliated to one to work, and even living away from the {{transl|ja|okiya}}, will usually commute there to begin her working evening.<ref name=Dalby2000/><ref name=Gal2003/>

A {{transl|ja|maiko}} will start her formal training on the job as a {{transl|ja|minarai}} (learning by observation) at an {{nihongo||お座敷|ozashiki}} (a geisha party), where she will sit and observe as the other {{transl|ja|maiko}} and geisha interact with customers. In this way, a trainee gains insights into the nature of the job, following the typical nature of traditional arts apprenticeships in Japan, wherein an apprentice is expected to learn almost entirely through observation. Although geisha at the stage of {{transl|ja|minarai}} training will attend parties, they will not participate on an involved level and are instead expected to sit quietly. Trainees can be hired for parties, but are usually uninvited – though welcomed – guests, brought along by their symbolic older sister as a way of introducing a new trainee to patrons of the {{transl|ja|karyūkai}}. {{transl|ja|Minarai}} usually charge just a third of the fee a typical geisha would charge, and typically work within just one particular tea house, known as the {{transl|ja|minarai-jaya}} – learning from the "mother" (proprietress) of the house. The {{transl|ja|minarai}} stage of training involves learning techniques of conversation, typical party games, and proper decorum and behaviour at banquets and parties. This stage lasts only about a month or so.{{sfn|Iwasaki|Brown|2002|p=132}}

[[File:Performing Gion Kouta.jpg|thumb|{{transl|ja|Maiko}} Katsumi and Mameteru performing the Gion {{transl|ja|Kouta}}.]]
After the {{transl|ja|minarai}} period, a trainee will make her official debut ({{transl|ja|misedashi}}) and become a {{transl|ja|maiko}}. This stage can last between three and five years. During this time, they learn from both other trainees senior to them, and their geisha mentors, with special emphasis placed on learning from her symbolic "older sister" ({{transl|ja|onee-san}}). Though any {{transl|ja|maiko}} or geisha "senior" in rank to an apprentice may be called "older sister", an apprentice's official "older sister" is a geisha bonded to her in an official ceremony, who will thereafter typically teach her about working in the {{transl|ja|karyūkai}}. This involves learning how to serve drinks, hold casual conversation, and some training in the arts, though the latter is usually carried out through by dance and music teachers.

[[File:Geisha-obi.jpg|thumb|left|Senior {{transl|ja|maiko}} Suzuha wearing {{transl|ja|sakkō}}, two weeks before her {{transl|ja|erikae}}.]]
There are three major elements of a {{transl|ja|maiko}}'s training. The first is the formal arts training, which takes place in schools found in every {{transl|ja|hanamachi}}. They study traditional instruments: the {{transl|ja|shamisen}}, the flute, and drums, as well as learning games,<ref name="kalman" />{{rp|29}} traditional songs, [[Japanese calligraphy#Today|calligraphy]],<ref name="McCurry">{{cite news|last=McCurry|first=J.|date=11 December 2005|title=Career geisha outgrow the stereotype|newspaper=The Age|location=Melbourne|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/career-geisha-outgrow-the-stereotype/2005/12/10/1134086848297.html|access-date=21 June 2010}}</ref>{{rp|2}} Japanese traditional dances (in the {{transl|ja|[[Buyō]]}} style), [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]], literature, and [[japanese poetry|poetry]].<ref name="coutsoukis-1">{{cite web |title=Japan Performing Arts |url=http://www.photius.com/countries/japan/society/japan_society_performing_arts.html |last=Coutsoukis |first=Photius |date=10 November 2004 | work = Countries of the World |access-date=2 June 2009}}</ref><ref name="coutsoukis-2">{{cite web |title=Japan Dance |url=http://www.photius.com/countries/japan/society/japan_society_dance.html |last=Coutsoukis |first=Photius |date=10 November 2004 | work = Countries of the World |access-date=2 June 2009}}</ref> The second element is the entertainment training which a trainee learns at various tea houses and parties by observing her "older sister". The third is the social skill of navigating the complex social web of the {{transl|ja|hanamachi}}; formal greetings, gifts, and visits are key parts of the social structure of the {{transl|ja|karyūkai}}, and crucial for the support network necessary to support a trainee's eventual debut as a geisha.

Around the age of 20–21, a {{transl|ja|maiko}} will graduate to geisha status in a ceremony known as {{transl|ja|[[erikae]]}} (turning of the collar).{{sfn|Ditmore|2006|p=184}}{{sfn|Gallagher|2003|p=159}}

Following debut, geisha typically do not go through major role changes, as there are no more formal stages of training. However, geisha can and do work into their eighties and nineties,<ref name=Fuj07/> and are still expected to train regularly,<ref name=HitByPoorEconomy /> though lessons may only be put on a few times a month. A geisha may decide to retire from her work, either to move away from the {{transl|ja|karyūkai}}, take on the role of "mother" of an {{transl|ja|okiya}}, or to mainly focus on performances and teaching other younger geisha.

===Non-Japanese geisha===
Since the 1970s, non-Japanese have also trained as and become geisha. [[Liza Dalby]], an American national, worked briefly with geisha in the Pontochō district of Kyoto as part of her doctorate research, although she did not formally debut as a geisha herself.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hyslop |first=Leah |title=Liza Dalby, the blue-eyed geisha |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatlife/8008802/Liza-Dalby-the-blue-eyed-geisha.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=18 July 2011 |location=London |date=4 October 2010}}</ref>{{sfn|Dalby|2000|p=106–109}}

==Geisha in Japanese society==
Geisha are regarded in wider Japanese society as some of the most successful businesswomen in Japan, with almost the entirety of the {{transl|ja|karyūkai}} being owned and run by women. New geisha are trained for the most part by their symbolic mothers and older sisters, and engagements are arranged through the mother of the house.<ref name=Dalby2000/>{{sfn|Rahayu|Emelda|Aisyah|2014|p=151}}
Infrequently, men take contingent positions within the {{transl|ja|karyūkai}} such as hair stylists,<ref name="McCurry"/> dressers (known as {{transl|ja|otokoshi}}, as dressing a {{transl|ja|maiko}} requires considerable strength) and accountants. The heads ({{transl|ja|iemoto}}) of some dance and music schools that geisha train under may also be male, with some barrier to entry for women to achieve the legacy of being the head of an artistic school.<ref name=Dalby2000/>

{{quote|text=The geisha system was founded, actually, to promote the independence and economic self-sufficiency of women. And that was its stated purpose, and it actually accomplished that quite admirably in Japanese society, where there were very few routes for women to achieve that sort of independence. |sign=Mineko Iwasaki in interview |source=''Boston Phoenix''<ref name="Wieder">{{Cite news |first=Tamara |last=Wieder |title=Remaking a memoir |url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/qa/documents/02473409.htm |newspaper=Boston Phoenix |date=17 October 2002 |access-date=12 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106181143/http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/qa/documents/02473409.htm |archive-date=6 January 2010 }}</ref>}}

Historically, the majority of women within Japan were wives who could not work due to familial duties. A geisha, however, could achieve independence by working to pay off her debts, making the profession one method for women to support themselves without becoming a wife.<ref name=Iwa02>{{harvnb|Iwasaki|Brown|2002}}</ref> Moreover, a geisha chosen as the heir ({{transl|ja|atotori}}) of a geisha house would have stable employment for much of her life, running the {{transl|ja|okiya}} throughout her career until the next generation.<ref name=Iwa02/>

Over time, some [[Feminism in Japan|Japanese feminists]] have seen geisha as exploited women, but some modern geisha see themselves as liberated feminists: "We find our own way, without doing family responsibilities. Isn't that what feminists are?"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/1656 |title=Japanese Feminism |access-date=12 January 2010 |last=Collins |first=Sarah |date=24 December 2007 |website=Serendip Studio |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012133023/http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/1656 |archive-date=12 October 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Geisha and male guests===
[[File:Geisha_Kyoto_Gion.jpg|thumb|A geisha entertaining a foreign male guest]]
Historically, geisha held an appeal for mainly male guests as a woman outside of the role of "wife". Wives were modest, responsible, and at times sombre, whereas geisha could be playful and carefree. Geisha would, on occasion, marry their clients, but marriage required retirement as a matter of fact.

Though relatively uncommon in previous decades, geisha parties are no longer understood to be affairs for male guests exclusively, with women commonly attending parties alongside other male guests. Though geisha will still gracefully flirt and entertain male guests, this is understood to be a part of a geisha's hostessing and entertainment skills, and is not taken as a serious sign of personal interest.

===Geisha and relationships===
Despite long-held connotations between sex and geisha, a geisha's sex and love life is usually distinct from her professional life.

{{blockquote|"Geishas are not submissive and subservient, but in fact they are some of the most financially and emotionally successful and strongest women in Japan, and traditionally have been so." |sign=Mineko Iwasaki, ''Geisha, A Life''<ref name=Iwa02/>}}

Most geisha are single women, though they may have lovers or boyfriends over time, and are allowed to pursue these relationships outside of [[#Danna partnerships|having a patron]]. In the present day, some geisha are married and continue to work in their capacity as geisha, despite it being uncommon; these geisha are likely to be based in regions outside of Kyoto, as its heavily traditionalist geisha districts would be unlikely to allow a married geisha to work.

===Geisha and prostitution===
Geisha have historically been conflated with [[prostitution in Japan|prostitution]] and commonly confused with prostitutes, despite the profession being mostly forbidden from receiving payment for sex since its inception. Despite this, some geisha have historically engaged in prostitution, either through personal choice, or through coercion and at times force.

In 1872, shortly after the [[Meiji Restoration]], the new government passed a law liberating "prostitutes ({{transl|ja|shōgi}}) and geisha ({{transl|ja|geigi}})", ambiguously grouping both professions together.{{sfn|Stanley|2013}} The terms of the law caused controversy, due to the unclear differentiation between each profession, with some officials claiming that prostitutes and geisha worked different ends of the same profession, and that there would be little difference in calling all prostitutes "geisha". Nonetheless, the government maintained an official distinction between both professions, arguing that geisha should not be conflated with or confused for prostitutes.{{sfn|Matsugu|2006|p=244}}

Though the law officially maintained a distance between geisha and prostitutes, some geisha still engaged in prostitution. Writing in 1956, former geisha Sayo Masuda wrote of her experiences in the {{transl|ja|onsen}} town of [[Suwa, Nagano|Suwa, Nagano Prefecture]], where she was sold for her virginity a number of times by the mother of her {{transl|ja|okiya}}. Such practices could be common in less reputable geisha districts, with {{transl|ja|onsen}} towns in particular being known for their so-called "double registered" geisha (a term for an entertainer registered as both a geisha and a prostitute).<ref name=Dalby2000/> A geisha working to pay off her incumbent debts to the mother of the house often had little choice but to engage in prostitution, whether forced to by her occupational "mother", or coerced to do it in order to pay off her debts.<ref name="Masuda2003"/>

In 1956, and following its implementation in 1958, the Prostitution Prevention Law {{transl|ja|(Baishun-bōshi-hō)}} criminalised the vast majority of prostitution, essentially leading to the outlawing of practices such as {{transl|ja|mizuage}} for geisha. In the present day, {{transl|ja|mizuage}} does not exist, and apprentices mark their graduation to geisha status with a series of ceremonies and events.

Despite this, the modern conflation between geisha and prostitutes continues as a pervasive idea, particularly in Western culture. Sheridan Prasso wrote that Americans had "an incorrect impression of the real geisha world ... geisha means 'arts person' trained in music and dance, not in the art of sexual pleasure".{{sfn|Prasso|2006|p=52}} Similarly, K.G. Henshall stated that the job of a geisha included "[entertaining] their customer, be it by dancing, reciting verse, playing musical instruments, or engaging in light conversation. Geisha engagements may include flirting with men and playful innuendos; however, clients know that nothing more can be expected. In a social style that is common in Japan, men are amused by the illusion of that which is never to be."<ref name="Henshall">{{harvnb|Henshall|1999|p=61}}</ref>

==={{transl|ja|Danna}} partnership===
In the past, it had been unspoken tradition for an established geisha to take a {{transl|ja|danna}}, or patron, who would pay for her expenses, buy her gifts, and engage her on a more personal level – at times involving sex – than a banquet or party would allow. This would be seen as a sign of the man's generosity, wealth, and status, as the expenses associated with being a geisha were relatively high; as such, a {{transl|ja|danna}} was typically a wealthy man, sometimes married, who may have been financially supporting the geisha in question through company expenses.<ref name=Dalby2000/>

In the present day, it is less common for a geisha to take a {{transl|ja|danna}}, purely due to the expenses involved and the unlikelihood that a modern man could support both his household and the cost of a geisha's living. Nonetheless, it was still common for geisha to retire from the profession in their mid-twenties to live off the support of their patron following the Second World War.<ref name=Dalby2000/> The practice continues today, though geisha do not take {{transl|ja|danna}} anywhere as commonly, and though intimacy in a {{transl|ja|danna}} partnership was in previous decades not seen as essential, in modern times it is valued to a much greater degree, due to the formal nature of the commitment and the awareness by both parties of how expensive it can be. The taking of a patron by a geisha is the closest thing to paid compensation for a personal partnership – whatever that partnership might entail – that a geisha officially engages in today.<ref name=Dalby2000/>{{update inline|reason=The source I'm using here states that the practice of having a danna is still undertaken, but it was written in the 1970s. If anyone can find a viable source stating it's still done in 2020, please add it in here.|date=May 2020}}

==="Geisha (Gee-sha) girls"===
During the [[occupied Japan|Allied occupation of Japan]], some prostitutes, almost exclusively working for the occupying forces in Japan, began to advertise themselves as "geisha girls", due in part to the fact that many foreign soldiers could not tell the difference between a geisha and a woman dressed in a kimono. These women came to be known commonly as "geesha girls",<ref name="Pra2006"/>{{sfn|Ozeki|2005}} a misnomer originating from the language barrier between the armed forces and the prostitutes themselves; the term spread quickly, as evidenced by the fact that shortly after their arrival in 1945, it was said that some occupying American GIs congregated in [[Ginza]] and shouted "We want geesha girls!".{{sfn|Booth|1995}}

The English term "geisha girl" soon became a byword for any female Japanese prostitute, whether actually selling sex or not; the term was applied to [[hostess bar|bar hostesses]] (who occupy the role of entertaining men through conversation, not necessarily sex) and [[streetwalker]]s alike.{{sfn|Prasso|2006|p=206}} The term "geisha girls", its quick spread to Western culture, and the accompanying mental image of a woman in a kimono offering sex and entertainment, is largely speculated as responsible for the continuing misconception in the West that all{{fact|date=September 2021}} geisha are engaged in prostitution.<ref name="Pra2006"/>

==={{transl|ja|Mizuage}}===
{{Main|Mizuage}}
{{nihongo3|"raising the waters"|水揚げ|Mizuage}}{{efn|"The resulting official line that geisha live by art alone is unrealistically prudish."{{sfn|Dalby|2009|p=190–191}}}} – was a ceremony undergone by junior {{transl|ja|kamuro}} (apprentice courtesans) and some {{transl|ja|maiko}} as part of the process of promotion to senior status. Originally meaning the unloading of a ship's cargo of fish, over time, the term became an innuendo for money earned in the {{transl|ja|karyūkai}},<ref name="Gal2003"/> another name for the entertainment business being the {{transl|ja|[[mizu shōbai]]}} – literally, "the water business".

Alongside changes in appearance – such as from the junior {{transl|ja|wareshinobu}} hairstyle to the more senior {{transl|ja|ofuku}} style,<ref name="Pra2006"/> – and visits paid to businesses and places of importance around the {{transl|ja|karyūkai}}, an apprentice would occasionally have their virginity sold to a patron, who ostensibly supported their graduation to geisha status – usually through the exorbitant fee charged for the privilege. Unscrupulous {{transl|ja|okiya}} owners would not uncommonly sell an apprentice's virginity more than once to different customers, pocketing the entire fee for themselves with the apprentice herself remaining an apprentice.

During [[World War II]], some prostitutes would use this term to refer to their acts with customers, leading to some confusion – particularly when referring to themselves as "geisha" when in the company of foreign soldiers, and sometimes amongst Japanese customers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://geishaofjapan.com/history/world-war-ii-and-the-american-occupation/ |title=World War II and the American Occupation |website=Geisha of Japan: Women of tradition and art | publisher = Geisha of Japan | date = n.d. | access-date = 20 October 2020}}</ref> After 1956, prostitution was criminalised in Japan, and {{transl|ja|mizuage}} is no longer practiced within the {{transl|ja|karyukai}}.{{sfn|Dalby|2000|p=115}}

==Geisha districts==
Geisha work in districts known as {{transl|ja|hanamachi}}{{snd}}lit. "flower towns", and are said to inhabit the {{transl|ja|karyūkai}}{{snd}}"the flower and willow world", a term originating from a time when both courtesans and geisha worked within the same areas. Courtesans were said to be the "flowers" in this moniker due to their showy and beautiful nature, with geisha being the "willows" due to their understated nature.

Part of the comparison between geisha and willows comes from the perceived loyalty amongst geisha to their patrons{{snd}}over time, it became known that certain factions, such as certain political parties, would patronise some geisha districts with their rivals patronising others. Though courtesans (and by extension, prostitutes) were humorously known for having loyalty only to the customer paying them for the night, a geisha would stand by her patrons and defend their best interests, her loyalty to her patrons being perceived as higher than her loyalty to her money.<ref name=Dalby2000/>

Historically, geisha on occasion were confined to operate in the same walled districts as courtesans and prostitutes; however, both professions have on some level always maintained a distance officially, despite often being legislated against by the same laws.

===Tokyo===
The six {{transl|ja|hanamachi}} in Tokyo are {{nihongo|Asakusa|浅草}}, {{nihongo|Akasaka|赤坂}}, {{nihongo|Kagurazaka|神楽坂}}, {{nihongo|Shimbashi|新橋}}, {{nihongo|Mukōjima|向島}}, and {{nihongo|Yoshichō|芳町}}. The [[Fukagawa, Tokyo|Fukagawa]] district of Tokyo is known for being the location of the first female geisha in Japan; however, the area faced decline following WWII, with its registry office closing temporarily in the 1980s, before being partially revived in the mid- to late-2000s.

Within the Tokyo prefecture but outside of the city's 23 wards,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://at-tama.tokyo/lang_en/ |title=Why we love TOKYO TAMA | work = Tokyo Tama | publisher = Tama Council for the Promotion of Tourism | access-date = 20 October 2020}}</ref> the city of [[Hachiōji]] has its own geisha culture heritage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://at-tama.tokyo/lang_en/geisya/ |title=Hachioji Geisha | work = Tokyo Tama | publisher = Tama Council for the Promotion of Tourism | access-date = 20 October 2020}}</ref>

===Kyoto===
The {{transl|ja|hanamachi}} in Kyoto are known for their adherence to tradition and high prestige, with the image of a Kyoto {{transl|ja|maiko}} typifying that of geisha culture within wider Japanese and international society.

In Kyoto, the different {{transl|ja|hanamachi}}{{snd}}known as the {{transl|ja|gokagai}} (lit., "five {{transl|ja|hanamachi}}"){{snd}}are seen as unofficially ranked. Gion Kobu, Ponto-chō and Kamishichiken are seen as the most prestigious,{{sfn|Dalby|2000|p=18–19}} with Gion Kobu at the top; below these three are Gion Higashi and Miyagawa-chō.{{sfn|Dalby|2008|p=6, 19 & 82}} The more prestigious {{transl|ja|hanamachi}} are frequented by powerful businessmen and politicians.<ref name="Downer2006"/>

In the 1970s, the geisha districts in Kyoto were known as the {{transl|ja|rōkkagai}} (lit., "six {{transl|ja|hanamachi}}"), as the district of Shimabara was still officially active as a geisha district, as well as hosting {{transl|ja|tayū}} reenactors; however, no geisha are active in Shimabara in the 21st century, despite modern {{transl|ja|tayū}} continuing to work there.<ref name="Dalby Geisha Notes"/>

===Niigata===
[[File:Niigata geisha dancing2.jpg|thumb|left|Niigata {{transl|ja|geigi}} dancing]]
The northern city of [[Niigata (city)|Niigata]] has its own geisha tradition dating back over 200 years to the Edo period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://enjoyniigata.com/en/spot/13698|title = Furumachi Geigi}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.niigata-cci.or.jp/geigi-en|title = Niigata Furumachi Geigi｜新潟商工会議所}}</ref> The geisha in Niigata are known as {{transl|ja|geigi}}. The Furumachi neighbourhoood is the place where most {{transl|ja|ochaya}} are located, with places such as the Nabechaya.

The Niigata {{transl|ja|geigi}} are known for holding more flexible rules and traditions than other geisha districts in Japan, leading to the district's revival in the modern day, following a period of decline in the 1980s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20211012-the-niigata-geigi-japans-other-geishas|title = The Niigata Geigi: Japan's 'other' geishas}}</ref>

===Regional {{transl|ja|hanamachi}}===
Though regional {{transl|ja|hanamachi}} are typically not large enough to have a hierarchy, regional geisha districts are seen as having less prestige than those in Kyoto, viewed as being the pinnacle of tradition in the {{transl|ja|karyukai}}.

Geisha in {{transl|ja|[[onsen]]}} towns such as [[Atami]] may also be seen as less prestigious, as geisha working in these towns are typically hired to work in one hotel for travelling customers they are usually not familiar with before entertaining; nevertheless, all geisha, regardless of region or district, are trained in the traditional arts, making the distinction of prestige one of history and tradition.
