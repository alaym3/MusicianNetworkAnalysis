==History==

===Formation and debut album ''Before The Fire'' (2006–2009)===
Rival Sons formed in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], where [[Jay Buchanan]] and Michael Miley lived. Buchanan previously recorded as a solo artist and with his ''Buchanan band''. He independently released ''All Understood'' in 2004 and ''True Love EP'' in 2006. Rival Sons formed from the remnants of guitarist [[Scott Holiday]]'s previous band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/rival-sons-mn0002672136|title=Artist Rival Sons|publisher=Allmusic|access-date=2014-05-24}}</ref> He had been active in a number of bands, including [[Human Lab]], who were signed to [[Atlantic Records]], but which he left and formed Black Summer Crush.

In 2006 Holiday came across Buchanan while searching on [[MySpace]] for a singer. Drummer Michael Miley had previously worked with Buchanan (as well as having been in [[Veruca Salt]] and the [[Carson Daly]] TV show band) and he had met bassist Robin Everhart playing at a benefit concert at [[Isaac Hayes]] house for [[Hurricane Katrina]] in Long Beach. The union of Holiday, Buchanan, Everhart and Miley led to the formation of Rival Sons.

As a singer-songwriter Buchanan was sceptical about joining a rock and roll band but after seeing the reception to the band's debut album ''Before the Fire'' (2009) produced by [[Dave Cobb]], Buchanan committed to Rival Sons full-time. Jack Rivera of the ''Huffington Post'' declared them "A rock band to watch" in November 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeff-rivera/rock-band-to-watch-rival_b_359148.html |title=Rock Band to Watch: Rival Sons &#124; Jeff Rivera |website=[[Huffingtonpost.com]] |date=2010-03-18 |access-date=2016-01-20}}</ref> Following this acclaim, they were invited to perform as a supporting act for [[AC/DC]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Kid Rock]] shows.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://earache.tumblr.com/post/2166446667/new-signings-rival-sons-to-support-kid-rock-at|title=Earache Records|website=Earache Records}}</ref> During this time, Rival Sons also performed on the race track during a televised show of the [[Indianapolis 500]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockchoice.com/riaval-sons-to-rock-indy-500 |title=Rival Sons To Rock Indy 500 |publisher=Rock Choice |date=2010-08-10 |access-date=2016-01-20}}</ref>

=== EP, signing and worldwide release of second album ''Pressure & Time'' (2010–2011)===

After the success of ''Before the Fire'', the band recorded a self-titled EP (independently released) in 2010, which caught the attention of [[Earache Records]] founder [[Digby Pearson]] and the band was offered a record deal in November 2010. The signing led to the band immediately recording the album ''[[Pressure & Time]]'' on the Earache label in early 2011. Their self-titled EP was re-released digitally by Earache Records in February 2011, from which their debut European single, "Torture", was taken.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earachenews.blogspot.co.uk/2011/01/rival-sons-self-titled-ep-out-now-on.html |title=Earache News: Rival Sons Self-Titled Ep Out Now On Itunes |website=Earachenews.blogspot.co.uk |date=January 10, 2011 |access-date=January 20, 2016}}</ref>

Rival Sons released ''Pressure & Time'' in June 2011. It reached number one on Amazon's Hard Rock best sellers and nineteen on the [[Billboard Hot 100]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7401032/rival-sons-new-album-hollow-bones-premiere|title=Rival Sons New Album Hollow Bones|magazine=Billboard|date=2016-06-09|access-date=January 20, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://earachenews.blogspot.co.uk/2011/04/rival-sons-reveal-pressure-time-album.html |title=Earache News: Rival Sons Reveal 'Pressure & Time' Album Cover |website=Earachenews.blogspot.co.uk |date=2011-04-21 |access-date=January 20, 2016}}</ref>

[[Storm Thorgerson]], who had worked with bands such as [[Pink Floyd]], [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], created the cover art for the album voluntarily.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/10-classic-storm-thorgerson-album-cover-designs-4132447|title=Ten Classic Storm Thorgerson Album Cover Designs|publisher=Creative Bloq|access-date=April 7, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.digitaljournal.com/a-and-e/music/interview-with-scott-holiday-from-rival-sons/article/387675|title=Interview with Scott Holiday from Rival Sons|publisher=Digital Journal|access-date=April 7, 2018}}</ref> Thorgerson liked Rival Sons, saying about the cover art:

{{quote|"I don't think you can be certain what's going on here. To me it's a picture about fear or concern. Here's someone about to descend and doesn't know what they'll face, or where this might lead. So, in his mind he's imagining the action. That's what you see, into his mind, as he focuses on what's about to happen.

When he gets to the bottom of the stairs, where does he go? Turn left, right or straight ahead, anything's possible. And I hope this cover will have fans of the band intrigued for a long while. To me, the cover should be part of the album, and not just packaging.”

- Storm Thorgerson (2011)}}

Rival Sons played a string of Canadian dates in May 2011, as well as SXSW, Hangout festival and [[the Viper Room]], before returning to Europe to play a series of European festivals such as [[Azkena Rock Festival|Azkena]], [[Sonisphere]], [[Rock Werchter]], [[Main Square Festival|Main Square]], Putte Parken, and [[Bospop]] in July 2011.

==Artistry==

===Songwriting and recording process===

Rival Sons' early albums, including ''Pressure & Time'', were written and recorded in the studio in an intense period of creativity. Speaking about the sophomore album that was written and recorded in 20 days, with producer Dave Cobb, guitarist Scott Holiday said, "This is just the simplest way to not cheat ourselves or the listener, rock and roll can't be over-thought, and if it is, it loses its immediacy and instinct...it needs to be a knife fight, not a knife dance."<ref>{{cite web |url= https://planetradio.co.uk/planet-rock/news/rock-news/rival-sons-reveal-new-album-details/ |title=Rival Sons reveal new album details |date=April 14, 2011 |work=Planet Rock |access-date=13 January 2021}}</ref>

Rival Sons have recorded regularly, releasing seven records in ten years. "Opting to keep the sound intact and very accurate as to deliver to the listener exactly what was happening in the room when we put it down" - Holiday, talking about the album ''Great Western Valkyrie''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/rival-sons-new-album-great-western-valkyre-june-release/|title=Rival Sons Set to Drop New Album 'Great Western Valkyrie'|first=Chad|last=Childers|website=Loudwire}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/in-the-studio-rival-sons-638213|title=In the studio: Rival Sons|first=Total Guitar02|last=June 2016|website=MusicRadar}}</ref>

The band has a long-standing, friendly and professional relationship with Grammy award-winning music producer Cobb, who has worked on all the band's albums and is often referred to as another member of the band. He is interested in simplicity in the recording and with the sound and vitality of real musicians in a room.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.soundonsound.com/people/dave-cobb|title=Dave Cobb|website=www.soundonsound.com}}</ref> Cobb encourages and captures the vocal punch of the band's mainman, Jay Buchanan. "He's unbelievable, a one-take guy — done. It's such a pleasure, because then you can get wild with things. You can experiment when it doesn't take long for the singer to do his thing."<ref name="auto"/>

Rival Sons recording process changed for their major label debut ''Feral Roots'', for the first time writing and recording over a process of months. Jay Buchanan stated that "You need to shift and constantly find new soil" within the creative process, taking eight months to write and record the Grammy nominated album instead of all their previous work which took less than six weeks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/rival-sons-vocalist-says-bands-writing-process-is-just-like-farming-you-need-to-shift-and-constantly-find-new-soil/|title=Rival Sons Vocalist Says Band's Writing Process Is 'Just Like Farming': 'You Need To Shift And Constantly Find New Soil'|date=November 23, 2018|website=BLABBERMOUTH.NET}}</ref>

===Style and influences===
