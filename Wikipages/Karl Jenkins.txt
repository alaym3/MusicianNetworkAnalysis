==Early life and education==

Karl Jenkins was born and raised in [[Penclawdd]], [[Gower Peninsula|Gower]], [[Wales]]. His mother was Swedish, and his father was Welsh. Jenkins received his initial musical instruction from his father, who was the local schoolteacher, chapel organist and choirmaster. He attended [[Gowerton Grammar School]].<ref name=CardUniKJ>{{cite web |url=http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/music/alumni/profiles/karljenkins.html |title=Alumni: Karl Jenkins |publisher=Cardiff University School of Music |access-date=22 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222162627/http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/music/alumni/profiles/karljenkins.html |archive-date=22 February 2015 }}</ref>

Jenkins studied music at [[Cardiff University]], and then commenced postgraduate studies in London at the [[Royal Academy of Music]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Karl Jenkins: Biography |url=http://www.karljenkins.com/biog |access-date=17 March 2016}}</ref>

==Career overview==

===Early career: Graham Collier's group and Nucleus===
For the bulk of his early career Jenkins was known as a [[jazz]] and [[jazz-rock]] musician, playing [[baritone saxophone|baritone]] and [[soprano saxophone]]s, keyboards and [[oboe]], an unusual instrument in a jazz context. He joined jazz composer [[Graham Collier]]'s group and later co-founded the jazz-rock group [[Nucleus (band)|Nucleus]], which won first prize at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in 1970.

===Soft Machine===
In 1972 he joined the [[Canterbury scene|Canterbury]] progressive rock band [[Soft Machine]]. The group played venues including [[The Proms]], [[Carnegie Hall]], and the [[Newport Jazz Festival]]. The album ''[[Six (Soft Machine album)|Six]]'', on which Jenkins first played with Soft Machine, won the ''[[Melody Maker]]'' British Jazz Album of the Year award in 1973. Jenkins also won the miscellaneous musical instrument section (as he did the following year). Soft Machine was voted best small group in the Melody Maker jazz poll of 1974. The albums in which Jenkins performed and composed were ''Six'', ''[[Seven (Soft Machine album)|Seven]]'' (1973), ''[[Bundles (album)|Bundles]]'' (1975), ''[[Softs (album)|Softs]]'' (1976) and ''[[Land of Cockayne (album)|Land of Cockayne]]'' (1981). Jenkins composed most of the tracks on ''Seven'' and nearly all of the tracks on the subsequent three albums.

After [[Mike Ratledge]] left the band in 1976, Soft Machine did not include any of its founding members, but kept recording on a project basis with line-ups revolving around Jenkins and drummer [[John Marshall (drummer)|John Marshall]]. Although ''Melody Maker'' had positively reviewed the Soft Machine of 1973 and 1974, [[Hugh Hopper]], involved with the group since replacing bassist [[Kevin Ayers]] in 1968, cited Jenkins's "third rate" musical involvement in his own decision to leave the band,<ref>''Soft Machine: Out-Bloody-Rageous'', Graham Bennett, 2008 ({{ISBN|0-946719-84-5}}) p. 246.</ref> and the band of the late 1970s has been described by band member [[John Etheridge]] as wasting its potential.<ref>''Soft Machine: Out-Bloody-Rageous'', Graham Bennett, 2008 ({{ISBN|0-946719-84-5}}) p. 324.</ref>

=== Other works===
In November 1973, Jenkins and Ratledge participated in a live-in-the-studio performance of [[Mike Oldfield]]'s [[Tubular Bells]] for the BBC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.memorabletv.com/global/uk-tv/second-house-tubular-bells-mike-oldfield/ |title=Second House: Tubular Bells |author= Mike Oldfield |work=Memorable TV |access-date=24 April 2011}}</ref> It is available on Oldfield's ''[[Elements – The Best of Mike Oldfield (video)|Elements]]'' DVD.

Jenkins has created advertising music, twice winning the industry prize in that field. From the 1980s, he developed a relationship with [[Bartle Bogle Hegarty]], starting with composing musics for their [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's]] jeans "Russian" series. He composed a classical theme used by [[De Beers]] diamond merchants for their television [[advertising campaign]] focusing on jewellery worn by people otherwise seen only in [[silhouette]]. Jenkins later included this as the title track in a compilation called ''[[Diamond Music]]'', and eventually created ''[[Palladio (Jenkins)|Palladio]]'', using it as the theme of the first movement. Other arrangements have included advertisements for the [[Renault Clio]].

As a composer, his breakthrough came with the crossover project ''[[Adiemus (albums)|Adiemus]]''. Jenkins has conducted the ''Adiemus'' project in Japan, Germany, Spain, [[Finland]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Belgium]], as well as London's [[Royal Albert Hall]] and [[Battersea Power Station]]. The ''[[Adiemus: Songs of Sanctuary]]'' (1995) album topped the classical album charts. It spawned a series of successors, each revolving around a central theme. In 2014 Jenkins released a tribute song for the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], performed by his [[new age music]] group also called Adiemus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newagemusicworld.com/olympic-tribute-song-by-adiemus/ |title=Olympic Tribute Song by Adiemus |date=8 January 2014 |first=John P. |last=Olsen |website=New Age Music World}}</ref>

Jenkins was the first international composer and conductor to conduct the [[University of Johannesburg]] Kingsway Choir led by Renette Bouwer, during his visit to South Africa as the choir performed his ''[[The Armed Man|The Armed Man: A mass for peace]]'' together with a 70-piece orchestra.

Jenkins' choral work ''The Peacemakers'', features texts from [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]], [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Anne Frank]] and [[Mother Teresa]], as well as words from the Bible and the [[Qur'an]] with some new text specially written by [[Terry Waite]]. On the 2012 record the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] is joined by different vocal forces including Rundfunkchor [[Berlin]], the [[City of Birmingham]] Youth Chorus, and the 1000-strong "[[The Really Big Chorus]]" made up of members of UK choirs from across the country brought together in one day, in one studio, to contribute to two movements on the album. Guest artists include violinist [[Chloë Hanslip]], soprano [[Lucy Crowe]], [[Davy Spillane]] on [[Uilleann pipes]], Indian [[bansuri]] player Ashwin Srinivasan and jazz musicians [[Nigel Hitchcock]] and [[Laurence Cottle]]. The album was released on 26 March 2012. The world premiere of this seventeen-movement work took place, however, in New York City's Carnegie Hall on 16 January 2012. Jenkins conducted from the podium, and John H. Briggs, Sr. conducted the Children's Chorus from a seated position. Briggs was the Choral Arts Conductor of one of the participating schools and its two choruses: ''Il Bel Canto'' and ''Die Meistersingers'' of Gwynn Park Middle School, Maryland.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Additional concerts in the UK and US took place later in the year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.karljenkins.com/news/news-view/new-album-coming-soon-the-peacemakers |title=Warner releases world-premiere recording of The Healer as part of 'Still With the Music' collection |publisher=Karl Jenkins}}</ref>
