== Early life ==
Vuong was born in [[Ho Chi Minh City]], Vietnam, on a rice farm. His grandmother was a young woman who grew up in the countryside while his grandfather was a white American soldier in the Navy originally from Michigan. His grandparents met during the Vietnam War, married and had three children, Vuong's mother being one of them. His grandfather had gone back to visit home in the U.S. but was unable to return when [[Fall of Saigon|Saigon fell to communist forces]]. His grandmother had separated his mother and aunts in [[orphanage]]s, concerned for their survival before reuniting as adults. They fled Vietnam after a police officer came to suspect that his mother was of mixed heritage and in turn was working illegally under Vietnamese law.<ref name=":3"/>

[[File:OceanWiki.jpg|thumb|left| Vuong in 2014]]
A two-year-old Vuong and his family eventually arrived in a refugee camp in the Philippines before achieving asylum and migrating to the United States, settling in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], United States with six relatives. His father abandoned his family after that. Vuong was reunited with his paternal grandfather later in life.<ref name="found"/><ref name=":0">{{Cite magazine|url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/how-a-poet-named-ocean-means-to-fix-the-english-language|title=How a Poet Named Ocean Means to Fix the English Language|magazine=The New Yorker|date=April 7, 2016|access-date=2017-06-28}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/books/review-night-sky-with-exit-wounds-verses-from-ocean-vuong.html|title=Review: 'Night Sky With Exit Wounds,' Verses From Ocean Vuong|date=2016-05-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name=":3"/> Vuong, who suspects [[dyslexia]] runs in his family,<ref name=":3">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/03/ocean-vuong-forward-prize-vietnam-war-saigon-night-sky-with-exit-wounds|title=War baby: the amazing story of Ocean Vuong, former refugee and prize-winning poet|first=Claire|last=Armitstead|date=3 October 2017|website=the Guardian|access-date=3 October 2018}}</ref> was the first in his family to learn to read,<ref name=":2"/> at the age of eleven.<ref name=":0"/>

== Education ==
Vuong attended [[Glastonbury High School]] in [[Glastonbury, Connecticut]], a school known for academic excellence. "I didn’t know how to make use of it," Vuong said, noting that his grade point average at one point was 1.7.<ref>Kat Chow, "Going Home With Ocean Vuong," ''The Atlantic'', 4 June 2019, accessed 2020-5-15.[https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/06/going-home-ocean-vuong-on-earth-were-briefly-gorgeous/590938/]</ref>

While in high school, he told fellow Glastonbury graduate Kat Chow he "understood he had to leave Connecticut." "After spending some time at a community college, Vuong headed to [[Pace University]], in New York, to study marketing. His time there lasted only a few weeks before he understood it wasn’t for him."<ref>[https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/06/going-home-ocean-vuong-on-earth-were-briefly-gorgeous/590938/ Kat Chow, "Going Home With Ocean Vuong."]</ref>

He then enrolled at [[Brooklyn College]] of the [[City University of New York]], where he studied 19th-century English literature under poet and novelist [[Ben Lerner]], and received his B.A. in English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/news/bcnews/bcnews_120605.php |title=Brooklyn College &#124; Ocean Sounds: A Brooklyn College Alumnus Reflects on His Life |publisher=Brooklyn.cuny.edu |date=2012-06-05 |access-date=2016-08-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/news/bcnews/bcnews_130614.php |title=Brooklyn College &#124; Mentoring Demands Respect, Says Ben Lerner About His Work with Ocean Vuong |publisher=Brooklyn.cuny.edu |date=2013-06-14 |access-date=2016-08-28}}</ref> He received his M.F.A. in poetry from [[New York University]].

In August 2020, Vuong was revealed as the seventh writer to contribute to the [[Future Library project]].<ref>{{cite news|title='You'll have to die to get these texts': Ocean Vuong's next manuscript to be unveiled in 2114|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/19/ocean-vuong-2114-book-future-library-norway|access-date=24 October 2020|website=The Guardian|date=19 August 2020}}</ref> The project, which compiles original works by writers each year from 2014 to 2114, will remain unread until the collected 100 works are eventually published in 2114. Discussing his contribution to the project, Vuong opined that, "So much of publishing is about seeing your name in the world, but this is the opposite, putting the future ghost of you forward. You and I will have to die in order for us to get these texts. That is a heady thing to write towards, so I will sit with it a while.”

Currently, Vuong lives in [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]], Massachusetts,<ref name="aboutocean">{{Cite web|url=https://www.oceanvuong.com/about|title=oceanvuong|website=oceanvuong|language=en|access-date=2018-03-11}}</ref> and is an associate professor in the MFA Program for Writers at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst|University of Massachusetts at Amherst]].<ref name="aboutocean"/> He is a [[Kundiman (nonprofit organization)|Kundiman]] fellow.<ref name="Fellows">{{Cite web|url=http://kundiman.org/fellows|title=Fellows|website=Kundiman|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-27}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Vuong has described himself as being raised by women. His mother, a [[manicurist]], gave him the name of Beach. During a conversation with a customer, Vuong's mother pronounced the word "beach" as "bitch". The customer suggested she use the word "ocean" to substitute for "beach". After learning the definition of the word ocean — the most massive classified body of water, such as the Pacific Ocean, which connects the United States and Vietnam — she renamed him Ocean.<ref name=":0" />

Vuong is openly gay,<ref>{{cite web|date=1 August 2011|title=Ocean Vuong: The TNB Self-Interview|url=http://thenervousbreakdown.com/ovuong/2011/08/ocean-vuong-the-tnb-self-interview/}}</ref> and is a practicing [[Zen Buddhist]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/scares-writer-zen-buddhist-ocean-vuong|title=What Scares Writer and Zen Buddhist Ocean Vuong|date=August 16, 2017}}</ref>
