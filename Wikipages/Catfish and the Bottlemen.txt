They promoted themselves by playing in support slots to friends' bands, such as Northwich's [[The Shallow Call]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Northwich band The Shallow Call to launch new single at DeBees Music Bar in Winsford |url=https://www.cheshire-live.co.uk/news/local-news/northwich-band-shallow-call-launch-5218548 |website=Cheshire Live |date=18 August 2009}}</ref> and by playing in car parks after other artists' gigs, including bands such as [[Kasabian]].<ref name=bio/> [[Steve Lamacq]] first played an early demo on [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] in March 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00hz20y/segments |title=BBC Radio 6 Music - Steve Lamacq, 06/03/2009 |website=Bbc.co.uk |date=2009-03-06 |access-date=2020-06-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2014/catfish-bbc-music-awards|title=BBC Introducing presents Catfish and the Bottlemen at the inaugural BBC music awards{{Snd}} Media Centre|website=Bbc.co.uk|access-date=2016-06-01}}</ref> During 2009, Catfish came runners up in the 'North Wales Battle of the Bands' having been beaten to the post by another local band The Fides who later closed the Conwy River Festival.

Original drummer Jon Barr was replaced by Robert Timothy John "Bob" Hall in 2010. Hall was introduced to the band by North Wales-based producer Russ Hayes who was working with the band at the time.<ref name="BPI" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mikedolbear.com/story.asp?StoryID=884|title=Interview with Dave Nuttall of Jalapeno Custom Drums |website=Mike Dolbear Drums |access-date=1 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916003723/http://mikedolbear.com/story.asp?StoryID=884#|archive-date=16 September 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

McCann met future band member Johnny Bond at Ravenstonedale festival in 2011, when the latter was a member of the band Symphonic Pictures. Bondy later joined the band in 2014.

The band derives its name from McCann's first childhood musical memory: that of an Australian street busker in Sydney, playing beer bottles strung to a wire who goes by the name [[Catfish the Bottleman]]. He was called "Catfish" because of an unusually styled spiky beard he had when he first began playing in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catfishthebottleman.com/|title=Catfish and the Bottlemen named after the legendary CATFISH THE BOTTLEMAN|access-date=7 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629230823/http://www.catfishthebottleman.com/|archive-date=29 June 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=10 Things You Never Knew About Catfish and the Bottlemen|url=https://www.nme.com/photos/10-things-you-never-knew-about-catfish-and-the-bottlemen-1409372|website=NME|access-date=27 June 2015|first=Emily|last=Barker|date=22 May 2015|archive-date=3 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103111539/http://www.nme.com/photos/10-things-you-never-knew-about-catfish-and-the-bottlemen-1409372}}</ref> McCann was reunited with Catfish the Bottleman in January 2015 at the studios of [[Triple J]] radio in [[Sydney]].
