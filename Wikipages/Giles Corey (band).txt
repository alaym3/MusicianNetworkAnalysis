'''Giles Corey''' is a musical project formed by [[Have a Nice Life]] member Dan Barrett. As of 2021, Barrett has released one studio album, two EPs and one live album under the Giles Corey name.

==History==
When speaking of his plans for the debut album, Barrett said "Giles Corey as a project started off very differently from where it ended. Initially, I was just wondering if I could write country and western songs, and sort of turn folk music into something that sounded like it came from me. I put restrictions on the kinds of instruments I could use, and so on. That kind of faded away as the record took on a life of its own" as well as "Giles Corey was meant to have no electronic instruments (though I broke that rule) and to be influenced by country music, and the songwriting style grew out of that".<ref name=":1">{{cite web| url=https://www.scenepointblank.com/features/interviews/giles-corey/| title=Interviews: Giles Corey| website=scenepointblank| date=2 November 2011| accessdate=30 October 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191030221255/https://www.scenepointblank.com/features/interviews/giles-corey/| archive-date=30 October 2019| url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://mithratemplezine.com/interview-dan-barrett-have-a-nice-life-giles-corey-nahvalr/| title=Interview Dan Barrett (Have a Nice Life, Giles Corey, Nahvalr)| website=mithratemplezine| date=3 January 2018| accessdate=30 October 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191030221255/http://mithratemplezine.com/interview-dan-barrett-have-a-nice-life-giles-corey-nahvalr/| archive-date=30 October 2019| url-status=live}}</ref> Barrett makes frequent use of sampling in the project.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Smith|first=Robin|date=February 12, 2014|title=The Quietus {{!}} Reviews {{!}} Have a Nice Life|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/14475-have-a-nice-life-the-unnatural-world-review|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-06-04|website=[[The Quietus]]|language=en-us}}</ref>

It is an exploration of cult leader Robert Voor and Barrett's own stories of depression and suicide. It continues the story of the accompanying book to ''[[Deathconsciousness]]''.<ref name=":1" /> It was described by Barrett as "an intensely personal, intimate portrait of depression".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theflenser.com/giles-corey-s-t-dlpbook-hinterkaifeck-lp/|title=GILES COREY "S/T" DLP+BOOK, HINTERKAIFECK LP|website=[[The Flenser]]|date=March 13, 2020|accessdate=March 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200325145357/http://theflenser.com/giles-corey-s-t-dlpbook-hinterkaifeck-lp/|archive-date=March 25, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

Opening track "The Haunting Presence" features piano and the sound of static and screams.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|last=Rosean|first=Samuel|date=January 31, 2020|title=The Beginner's Guide To: Slowcore|url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4152207-the-beginners-guide-to--slowcore|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2021-01-11|website=[[Drowned In Sound]]|language=en}}</ref> The song "Empty Churches" features a sample of a documentary monologue discussing ghosts and radio transmissions.<ref name=":0" /> According to Samuel Rosean of ''Drowned In Sound'' the album was "highly indicative of the more lo-fi and emotional centric design of modern [[slowcore]], predicting an almost full decade of spilling, unpretentious slowcore that was to come".<ref name=":2" />

On August 25, 2012, they released their first [[extended play]] (EP), ''Deconstructionist''. The EP, unlike the previous, was solely [[ambient music]], described by Barrett as "designed to induce trances, possession states, and out-of-body experiences".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://gilescorey.bandcamp.com/album/deconstructionist | title=Deconstructionist | website=bandcamp | date=25 August 2012 | accessdate=30 October 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190821133705/https://gilescorey.bandcamp.com/album/deconstructionist | archive-date=21 August 2019 | url-status=live }}</ref> Barrett was inspired by "ritual trance" while making the EP.<ref name="Wired" /> Musically, the EP is composed of [[Beat (acoustics)#Binaural beats|binaural beats]].<ref name="Wired" /> Phill Cameron described the EP as "disconcerting racket" that "instead of feeling claustrophobic" feels "almost lonely; every sound echoes, as if in a huge space, and the constant pressure of electronic beats adds a sense of desperate urgency to the music. It's unsettling and uncomfortable."<ref name="Wired" /> The EP was accompanied by a thirty-page [[Primer (textbook)|primer]].<ref name="Wired">{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/dan-barrett-deconstructionist|title=Binaural beats EP designed to send listeners into 'altered states of consciousness'|website=[[Wired UK|Wired]]|last=Cameron|first=Phill|date=March 23, 2013|accessdate=June 4, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170117003831/http://www.wired.co.uk/article/dan-barrett-deconstructionist|archive-date=January 17, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The second song, "Infinite Death" features a [[pitch shift]]ed sample of Yale philosophy professor [[Shelly Kagan]] and discusses "our inability to properly imagine our own deaths."

It was followed by their second [[extended play]] (EP) released on 21 February 2013 titled ''Hinterkaifeck''.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://gilescorey.bandcamp.com/album/hinterkaifeck | title=Hinterkaifeck | website=bandcamp | date=21 February 2013 | accessdate=30 October 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190512182213/https://gilescorey.bandcamp.com/album/hinterkaifeck | archive-date=12 May 2019 | url-status=live }}</ref>

Lastly, it was followed by a [[live album]], ''Live in the Middle of Nowhere'', released February 27, 2013. The album was recorded at the Enemies List Home Recordings Warehouse in Meriden, CT and features accompaniment from [[The Flenser|Flenser]] labelmate Thom Wasluck, who played the [[Musical keyboard|keyboard]] on "[[Deathconsciousness|Earthmover]]".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://gilescorey.bandcamp.com/album/live-in-the-middle-of-nowhere | title=Live in the Middle of Nowhere | website=bandcamp | date=27 February 2013 | accessdate=30 October 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190819015657/https://gilescorey.bandcamp.com/album/live-in-the-middle-of-nowhere | archive-date=19 August 2019 | url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2020, Barret was set to perform at the Roadburn Festival in Tilburg, Netherlands as Giles Corey in celebration of The Flenser's 10th anniversary. This performance would have been the first time project had been played as a full-band with Have a Nice Life band member Tim Macuga accompanying him.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Desk|first=TV News|date=November 14, 2019|title=The Flenser Announces 10 Year Anniversary Showcase At Roadburn 2020|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/netherlands/article/The-Flenser-Announces-10-Year-Anniversary-Showcase-At-Roadburn-2020-20191114|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-06-04|website=BroadwayWorld|language=en}}</ref> Due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic|coronavirus outbreak]] the show was cancelled with much of the program being postponed until 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Roadburn 2020 postponed to 15-18 April, 2021 – Roadburn Festival|url=https://roadburn.com/roadburn-2020-postponed-to-15-18-april-2021/|accessdate=Apr 30, 2020}}</ref>
