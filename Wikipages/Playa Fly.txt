'''Playa Fly''' (born '''Ibn Young''' on September 2, 1977) is an American [[rapping|rapper]] from [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. Fly was a member of the [[Three 6 Mafia]] (then known as Lil' Fly), but he stopped collaborating in 1995 due to monetary disputes and philosophical differences after recording one album under the group's guidance. Pursuing a solo career as Playa Fly, he released one independent album before signing a three-album contract with Super Sigg Records. During that period he had many underground hits, perhaps the most famous being "Nobody Needs Nobody". Fly's early hit immediately gained notoriety from the song "Triple Bitch Mafia", which lashed out against his former group.

==Biography==

===Early life and Triple 6 Mafia===
Young was born in Memphis in 1977 and grew up on South Parkway where he largely raised by his grandmother.<ref name="Lisle">Lisle, Andrea (2008) "[http://www.gomemphis.com/news/2008/sep/12/playa-fly-movin-and-groovin/ Concert preview: Playa Fly movin' and groovin']", ''[[The Commercial Appeal]]'', September 12, 2008, retrieved 2011-03-05</ref> His father was the musician Willie David Young. A.K.A, Mr. Bill Chill, a former member of The Avantis and The Ovations, while his mother was a [[drug dealer]], an activity that Young also got involved in at the age of thirteen.<ref name="Lisle" />

Under the title Lil' Fly, Young began his career at the age of sixteen, testing the waters with "Don't Never Test His Pimpin" as a start. He eventually became affiliated with [[DJ Paul]] and [[Juicy J]] of Triple 6 Mafia (Now known as [[Three 6 Mafia]]) and under the wing of the up-and-coming producers, "Slangin' Rocks" was produced (part one featured on his underground single, part two featured on DJ Paul's ''Vol. 16 For Da Summa Of '94''). He was featured on [[Gangsta Blac]]'s underground hit album, ''[[Breakin Da Law]]'', and the Three 6 Mafia's first mainstream album, ''[[Mystic Stylez]]''. It was even planned for releasing Fly's first album on their label (which was, at that time, [[Prophet Entertainment]]) and his first single, "From Da Darkness Of Da Kut", was released in 1994. After leaving the group a year later, Fly put out his infamous diss record, "Triple Bitch Mafia",<ref name="Birchmeier" /><ref name="Hess">Hess, Mickey (2009) ''Hip Hop in America: a Regional Guide: Volume 1 - East Coast and West Coast'', Greenwood Publishing Group, {{ISBN|978-0-313-34323-0}}, p. 566</ref> then changed his title to Playa Fly and was featured on [[Tommy Wright III]]'s ''On the Run'' album before signing with Super Sigg Records. Playa Fly has expanded all over the south by influencing young cliques like I.B.N. (who uses Fly's real name as their title), based in [[Decatur, Georgia]].

===Super Sigg===
In 1996, Playa Fly released his first album with Super Sigg, ''[[Fly Shit]]''.<ref name="Birchmeier">Birchmeier, Jason "[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/playa-fly-p206202/biography Playa Fly Biography]", [[Allmusic]], retrieved 2011-03-05</ref> The album had songs such as "Nappy Hair & Gold Teeth", "Da Show", "Crownin' Me", "Flizy Comin' (Triple Bitch Mafia pt.2)" and "Work To Do". It included other artists such as Gangsta Blac, Bill Chill, Criminal Manne, Icy K, D-A-V, Tay-Dog and Playa Posse. This album was also where Fly began his association with producer Blackout.

In 1998, ''[[Movin' On (Playa Fly album)|Movin' On]]'' was released. ''Movin' On'' had such tracks as "Situation", "Start Runnin", "Nobody", "[[Funk-N-Bonk]]" and "Write Sum Bump". It also featured Gangsta Blac, Bill Chill (Fly's father), Minnie Mae Mafia, and Cool B. Fly's father died shortly before this album's completion.

''[[Just Gettin' It On]]'', a re-release of his underground solo CD (with a bonus track), was released by Diamond in March 1999. ''[[Da Game Owe Me]]'' was released in November of the same year, the last album to be released by Super Sigg Records. ''Just Gettin' It On'' had songs like "Gettin' It On", "[[Just Awaken Shaken]]", "Triple Bitch Mafia" and "Fuck A Wanna Be". ''Just Gettin' It On'' included the Minnie Mae Mafia, Terror, Lil' Yo, Gangsta Blac and the late Bill Chill. The album's bonus track, "Fuck A Wanna Be", had a video made for it (under the title "Just A Wanna Be") and is Playa Fly's only [[music video]]. ''Da Game Owe Me'' featured Gangsta Blac, Thaistik, Blackout and Terror.

===Minnie Mae Muzik===
After leaving Super Sigg, Playa Fly created his own label named after his grandmother, Minnie Mae Muzik.<ref name="Lisle" /> On this label, Fly began production on ''[[Fly2K]]'' along with the forces of Diamond Records. Midway through the project, Fly was arrested for possession of narcotics and sent to prison to serve a seven-year sentence in 1999.<ref name="Lisle" /> The release date for ''Fly2K'' was pushed back from 2000 to 2002. Playa Fly was still present on his album while he was in prison, as he rapped [[a cappella]] over the phone ("Flexxin' Skit" and "Sap Sucka"). ''Fly2K'' was released in November 2002, the album included such songs like "Bill Chill Lives" (a tribute to Bill Chill), "Universal Heartthrob", "Here Fly Come", "Club Friendly", "We Ain't Playin Witcha", "Life Goes On" and "Few & Da Proud". The album included other artist like Mista Tito, Maimi Miane, D-A-V, Bubba Wiley, Thaistik, DeRico, R-E-G and LaCynthia.

In mid-2006, Fly was released from prison and resumed his career, with a new album planned - ''Mafia All Day''.<ref name="Lisle" /> On July 5, a single "Horses", was featured on the ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' website. In addition to his release, Fly joined the [[New Prophet Camp]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

In December 2010, Playa Fly released the single "Blast Off", taken from the new ''Mafia All Day'' album that has been delayed for more than two years.
