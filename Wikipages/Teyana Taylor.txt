Until I'm free, until I can get [Def Jam] to release me, yes I want to retire."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/9494974/teyana-taylor-confirms-music-retirement-comments/|title=Teyana Taylor Confirms Comments About Her Retirement From Music: 'I Don't Want To Do This Anymore'|work=Billboard|last=Peters|first=Mitchell|date=December 6, 2020|access-date=December 7, 2020}}</ref> She later stated much of the frustration leading to retirement could be traced back to her label undervaluing her, but she would not be retiring for good.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/teyana-taylor-explains-why-she-decided-to-announce-retirement-from-music-cites-frustration-with-record-label|title=Teyana Taylor Explains Why She Decided to Announce Retirement From Music, Cites Frustrations With Label|publisher=Complex}}</ref>
