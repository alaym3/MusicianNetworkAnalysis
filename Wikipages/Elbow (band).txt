==Contributions and collaborations==
Elbow recorded an acoustic cover of [[Destiny's Child]]'s "[[Independent Women]]" for a [[BBC Radio 1]] session which was turned into a popular web animation by [[Joel Veitch]], featuring a band of flat-capped northern kittens "performing" the song.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rathergood.com/independent_woman/ |title=Independent Woman – played by kittens |first=Joel |last=Veitch |website=Rathergood.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021012025042/http://www.rathergood.com/independent_woman/ |archive-date=12 October 2002}}</ref>

The band released several songs for [[War Child (charity)|War Child]] compilations. In 2002 Elbow recorded a cover of "[[Something in the Air (song)|Something in the Air]]" for the compilation ''[[NME in Association with War Child Presents 1 Love|1 Love]]''. Elbow contributed the song "Snowball" to another compilation, ''[[Help!: A Day in the Life]]'', in September 2005. The song was originally recorded for the ''[[Cast of Thousands]]'' record but omitted from the final album as the band felt it did not fit; the political lyrics suited the Warchild compilation.<ref name="Reluctant Heroes">{{cite book|last1=Middles|first1=Mick|title=Reluctant Heroes: The Story of Elbow|date=5 November 2009|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-0-85712-025-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRs5ECeChtcC&q=%22Cast+of+Thousands%22+snowball+elbow+warchild&pg=PT99|access-date=3 August 2015}}</ref> In 2009 Elbow contributed their cover of [[U2]]'s "[[Running to Stand Still]]" to ''[[War Child Presents Heroes]]''. Garvey explained: "When the band first met each other aged 17, Mark and Craig's father Gareth would lend us his Volvo to get our gear around. It seemed that for a year and a half all that we listened to in that car was ''Rattle and Hum''. I remember the excitement every time a U2 album was released, we just loved them. The first song we ever covered together before we had enough of our own songs to do a performance was 'Running to Stand Still'. For 'Heroes' we've changed the order of things but kept every musical theme in the song. We wrote it with the members of U2 in mind. War Child do exactly what it says on the tin. These kids shouldn't be in such circumstances in the first place, but they are, so thank god someone's doing something about it".<ref>{{cite news|title=War Child Album Previews on MySpace|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/war-child/war-child-album-previews-on-myspace-news|access-date=3 February 2013|newspaper=Uncut|date=2 February 2013}}</ref>
