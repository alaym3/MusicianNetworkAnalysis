They were signed to [[Island Records]] from 2001 to 2012 and have released six albums and one [[extended play]] to date.

==History==
===Early career (1994–2000)===
Vocalist Doug Robb had known guitarist Dan Estrin for some time before competing against him in a high school battle of the bands competition and subsequently, they decided to form a band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popsyndicate.com/index.php/site/story/playing_with_knives_chris_hesse_of_hoobastank/ |title=Playing With Knives: Chris Hesse of Hoobastank |publisher=PopSyndicate.com |access-date=November 7, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111155332/http://www.popsyndicate.com/index.php/site/story/playing_with_knives_chris_hesse_of_hoobastank/ |archive-date=January 11, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref>  They then recruited Markku Lappalainen and Chris Hesse to form Hoobastank.

In an interview, Chris Hesse explained that the band's name originated from Robb's mispronunciation of a German street name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orlandofloridaguide.com/entertainment/music/bands/hoobastank/interview.htm |title=Interview with Hoobastank Drummer Chris Hesse at Freebird Cafe in Jacksonville, FL |publisher=OrlandoFloridaGuide.com |access-date=October 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930051012/http://www.orlandofloridaguide.com/entertainment/music/bands/hoobastank/interview.htm |archive-date=September 30, 2011 }}</ref>

Hoobastank started playing gigs at the local venue [[Cobalt Cafe]] along with [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] and others. They recorded their first full-length self-released album in 1998 called ''[[They Sure Don't Make Basketball Shorts Like They Used To]]'', which features a saxophone section headed by Jeremy Wasser, who executive produced the album and recorded the ''Summer Romance'' saxophone solo on [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]]' ''[[S.C.I.E.N.C.E.]]'' album. The Incubus connections continued with Fourth Street Recording's music producer Jim Wirt and logos and visual design by Brett Spivey.

By this stage, Hoobastank had developed a strong reputation in Southern California. This attracted interest from [[Island Records]], who subsequently signed the band in 2000. At the time of signing, the band had completed a second full-length album, titled ''[[Forward (Hoobastank album)|Forward]]'', also featuring Jeremy Wasser. However, the band felt that the direction they were heading in would work best without a sax, so Wasser departed the band and the album was shelved. A few tracks were rerecorded for release on the band's self-titled 2001 release. The original recordings from the ''Forward'' sessions made their way to the Internet via peer to peer sites in late 2001.

===''Hoobastank'' (2001–2002)===
Hoobastank released its [[Hoobastank (album)|self-titled debut album]] in November 2001. The first single was "[[Crawling in the Dark]]", which was a breakthrough hit, reaching No.&nbsp;68 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], No.&nbsp;3 on the Modern Rock chart, No.&nbsp;7 on the Mainstream Rock chart<ref>{{cite web|url=https://billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.vnuArtistId=470278&model.vnuAlbumId=612770 |title=''Billboard.com'' |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225092120/http://billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.vnuArtistId=470278&model.vnuAlbumId=612770 |archive-date=December 25, 2007 }}</ref> and No.&nbsp;1 on an [[MP3.com]] download chart in early 2002. Also, the song was featured in the 2002 inline skating game, ''[[Aggressive Inline (video game)|Aggressive Inline]]'', appearing on the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[PlayStation 2]] and [[GameCube]] consoles. The second single "[[Running Away]]" was even more successful, reaching No.&nbsp;44 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, No.&nbsp;2 on the Modern Rock chart, No.&nbsp;9 on the Mainstream Rock chart and No.&nbsp;3 on the MP3.com download chart. The ''Hoobastank'' album went Platinum due to these hit singles and reached No.&nbsp;25 on the ''Billboard'' 200 album charts and No.&nbsp;1 on the ''Billboard'' Heatseeker chart.

The album achieved recognition internationally with the band touring in Europe and Asia in support of the record. "[[Remember Me (Hoobastank song)|Remember Me]]", the third single released from this album, was a moderate hit, reaching No.&nbsp;23 on the Modern Rock charts. The band made a song titled "Losing My Grip" for the soundtrack of the movie ''[[The Scorpion King]]''.

===''The Reason'' (2003–2005)===
In early 2003, the group contributed the song "Right Before Your Eyes" to ''[[Daredevil: The Album]]''. The band then entered the studio with producer [[Howard Benson]]. Recording was disrupted for a month when Dan Estrin was seriously injured in a minibike accident in August. Estrin had recovered by October and the band headed off on a [[Nokia]] Unwired Tour with [[The All-American Rejects]] and [[Ozomatli]] in November.

Their second album ''[[The Reason (Hoobastank album)|The Reason]]'' was released in December 2003. The single "Out of Control" was made available for download on the band's website. Doug Robb said on the band's website: "A lot of it is about asking questions or questioning all that people see. It's not all about religion. "Out of Control" is about that and about opening your eyes after being blinded by being devoted to anything." "Same Direction" would reach No.&nbsp;9 on the US Modern Rock chart, No.&nbsp;16 on the Mainstream Rock chart and No.&nbsp;16 on a composite World Modern Rock chart (based on the US, Germany, Sweden, Finland, Canada, and Australia). A year later, the ''[[Let It Out (DVD)|Let It Out]]'' DVD collected the band's videos. "The Reason" was put to a popular music video on [[tangle.com|Tangle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tangle.com/view_video.php?viewkey=acb74a48e2a0a871be96 |title=A reason to live - Today's Christian Videos |publisher=Tangle.com |access-date=October 18, 2011}}</ref>

The [[The Reason (Hoobastank song)|title track]] was released as a single in the first half of 2004. It became a hit, reaching No.&nbsp;2 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, No.&nbsp;1 on the US and World Modern Rock charts, No.&nbsp;10 in Australia, No. 12 in the United Kingdom and No.&nbsp;15 in Germany. In Canada, it spent 21 weeks at the top, setting a new record for most weeks at No.&nbsp;1.  Meanwhile, in the United States, the album reached No.&nbsp;3 on the ''Billboard'' 200 album chart.

The band's international profile was increased by a support slot on [[Linkin Park]]'s ''[[Meteora (album)|Meteora]]'' world tour in early 2004.

===''Every Man for Himself'' (2006–2007)===

Their third album ''[[Every Man for Himself (album)|Every Man for Himself]]'' was released in May 2006 and debuted at No.&nbsp;12 on the ''Billboard'' chart. Three singles, "[[If I Were You (Hoobastank song)|If I Were You]]", "[[Inside of You (Hoobastank song)|Inside of You]]", and "[[Born to Lead]]", were released. Another single, "If Only", was planned to be released but was canceled for unknown reasons, possibly because of the low chart achievements of the first three singles. Despite this, the album has been certified Gold in the United States.

On a 2005 co-headlining tour with [[Velvet Revolver]], the band received a chilly reception from some audiences and rumors of a feud between Robb and Velvet Revolver frontman [[Scott Weiland]] were soon filling Internet message boards. "If I Were You" from ''Every Man for Himself'' addressed the whole affair.<ref name="bio">{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=hoobastank|bio=true}}|title=Hoobastank Biography|magazine=Billboard.com}}</ref> Robb later said in an interview with MTV News online that he has nothing against Scott Weiland or any other member of Velvet Revolver.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1508953/20050906/hoobastank.jhtml|title=Hooba Have A Few Words For Velvet Revolver|publisher=MTV.com}}</ref>

===''For(N)ever'' and ''The Greatest Hits'' (2008–2009)===
In October 2007, Robb posted on the official Hoobastank message boards and said that they have "set the bar very very high for this next CD" and that they have "more ideas going into this CD than ever before". On June 2, 2008, Robb posted an update on their temporary website, announcing that the recording process of their upcoming album was almost done and to expect a release date within a couple of weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islandrecords.com/site/artist_newsinfo.php?uf_item_id=1-105390&uf_system_id=0&artist_id=316 |title=Studio Update: June 2, 2008 ''hoobastank.com'' |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116023643/http://www.islandrecords.com/site/artist_newsinfo.php?uf_item_id=1-105390&uf_system_id=0&artist_id=316 |archive-date=January 16, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On September 19, Robb posted a Myspace bulletin announcing that the "new Hoobastank album is nearly done".

The album ''[[For(N)ever]]'' was released on January 27, 2009, as announced by Doug Robb in a blog entry on the band's official website.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hoobastank.com/discography/ |title=Discography |access-date=April 25, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426230911/http://hoobastank.com/discography/ |archive-date=April 26, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The song was featured as the theme song for [[TNA Wrestling]]'s [[Destination X 2009]] [[Pay Per View]].

On April 20, 2010, a [[Vanessa Amorosi]] fan website revealed details of a collaboration between Hoobastank and the Australian singer, a duet version of "[[The Letter (Hoobastank song)|The Letter]]". On August 5, it was confirmed that there was another version of the song on [[Universal Music Group|Universal International]]. This one was a duet between Hoobastank and the American-Japanese singer, lyricist, actress and model [[Anna Tsuchiya]].<ref name=universal>{{cite web|url=http://www.universal-music.co.jp/u-pop/artist/hoobastank/ |title=The Greatest Hits Don'T Touch My Moustache -Deluxe Edition |publisher=Universal-music.co.jp |access-date=October 18, 2011}}</ref> The website, VanessaAmorosi.net, also provided the duet version to be streamed in full for the first time. The music video was shot in Los Angeles at Lacy Street Studio with director Paul Brown. The video and single was serviced to Australian media on May 4. While the single was released in Australia on June 19, 2009, featuring Vanessa Amorosi, the version of the song featuring Anna Tsuchiya<ref name=universal/> appears on Hoobastank's greatest hits album ''[[The Greatest Hits: Don't Touch My Moustache#Deluxe Edition|The Greatest Hits: Don't Touch My Moustache (Deluxe Edition)]]''.
