'''Enslaved''' is a Norwegian [[extreme metal]] band formed by [[Ivar Bjørnson]] and [[Grutle Kjellson]] in [[Haugesund]] in June 1991. They are currently based in [[Bergen, Norway]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=104 |title=Enslaved Encyclopaedia Metallum entry |publisher=Metal-archives.com |date=17 July 2002 |access-date=15 July 2011}}</ref> The band's lineup has changed many times over the years, and Bjørnson and Kjellson have been the sole constant members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/enslaved-mn0000739437/biography|title=Enslaved {{!}} Biography & History {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=6 November 2016}}</ref> The current lineup also includes lead guitarist [[Arve Isdal]], keyboardist/singer Håkon Vinje, and drummer Iver Sandøy.

The band's music draws heavily on the Viking cultural and religious heritage of their home country of Norway for inspiration, and most of the band's lyrics relate to [[Norse mythology]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2016-08-08/10-of-the-best-metal-bands-from-norway|title=10 of the best metal bands from Norway|date=8 August 2016|newspaper=Metal Hammer|language=en-GB|access-date=6 November 2016}}</ref><ref name="metalsucks.net">{{Cite web|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2008/11/04/enslaveds-gruttle-kjellson-the-metalsucks-interview/|title=ENSLAVED'S GRUTTLE KJELLSON: THE METALSUCKS INTERVIEW|date=4 November 2008|website=MetalSucks|access-date=6 November 2016}}</ref> Though they began as a traditional [[black metal]] band their sound has undergone significant changes over time resulting in a more progressive sound. In 2014, members of Enslaved were commissioned by the Norwegian government to create a musical piece in celebration of the 200th anniversary of the [[Constitution of Norway|Norwegian constitution]]. This was later released as a studio album called ''Skuggsjá'' in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.season-of-mist.com/news/skuggsj%C3%A1-2015-09-30|title=Skuggsjá News: SKUGGSJA {{!}} Season of Mist, Metal Label|website=season-of-mist.com|access-date=6 November 2016}}</ref> To date, the bands has released fifteen full-length studio albums; the most recent of which, ''[[Utgard (album)|Utgard]]'', was released in October 2020 on [[Nuclear Blast|Nuclear Blast Records]]. 

==History==
[[File:Enslaved-Live-Oslo 2012.JPG|210px|thumb|left|Enslaved performing live in [[Oslo]] in October 2012]]

Enslaved was formed in July 1991 by [[Ivar Bjørnson]] and [[Grutle Kjellson]] (also known as Kjetil Grutle) when they were 13 and 17 years old, respectively. The band name was inspired by an [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]] demo track, "Enslaved in Rot."<ref name="tartarean" /> After many line-up changes throughout their career, Bjørnson and Kjellson are the only remaining original members. By 2004 the line-up solidified with guitarist Arve "Ice Dale" Isdal, drummer Cato Bekkevold, and keyboardist/vocalist Herbrand Larsen.

Prior to forming Enslaved, Bjørnson and Kjellson had been playing in a [[death metal]] band called Phobia, but like many in the burgeoning extreme metal movement, they were looking for new sources of inspiration and expression.<ref name="tartarean">{{cite web|url=http://www.tartareandesire.com/bands/Enslaved/585/ |title=Enslaved |publisher=Tartarean Desire |access-date=15 July 2011}}</ref> Though Enslaved began as a prototypical [[Norwegian black metal]] band in 1991, by 1993 they were incorporating song structures unusual for the genre; several of their earlier songs reach the ten-minute mark (their debut album, ''[[Vikingligr Veldi]]'', has only one song that is under ten minutes). As such, the band has rejected the black metal label and prefers the term "[[extreme metal]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLy7w6mQuPE |title=Enslaved Interview from 2009 |via=YouTube |access-date=15 July 2011}}</ref> ''[[Mardraum]]'' (2000) contained several multi-part epics such as "Større enn tid - Tyngre enn natt" and "Entrance – Escape". Several of the band's tracks (most prominently, "As Fire Swept Clean the Earth" from ''[[Below the Lights]]'') have used [[mellotron]].<ref name="bmuk">{{cite web |url=http://blackmetal.co.uk/reviews/10-audio/756-Enslaved-Below-the-Lights.html |title=Below the Lights review |publisher=BlackMetal.co.uk |date=26 February 2009 |access-date=15 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809140843/http://blackmetal.co.uk/reviews/10-audio/756-Enslaved-Below-the-Lights.html |archive-date=9 August 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> ''[[Isa (album)|Isa]]'' (2004) and ''[[Ruun]]'' (2006) show a marked departure from previous sounds, most notably with the inclusion of sharp dynamic shifts, and Bjørnson considers the former a turning point for the band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.blistering.com/fastpage/fpengine.php/link/1/templateid/11881/tempidx/5/menuid/3|title=Enslaved Feature Interview at Blistering.com|website=blistering.com|access-date=6 November 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303185826/http://www.blistering.com/fastpage/fpengine.php/link/1/templateid/11881/tempidx/5/menuid/3|archive-date=3 March 2016}}</ref> Following ''[[Ruun]]'', in 2007–2008, Bjørnson, Kjellson, and Isdal collaborated with the Norwegian noise duo Fe-Mail under the name Trinacria.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.myspace.com/trinacriamusic|title=Trinacria|publisher=Myspace|access-date=6 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Trinacria/124954|title=Trinacria|publisher=Encyclopaedia Metallum|access-date=6 October 2014}}</ref>

Enslaved released the album ''[[Vertebrae (album)|Vertebrae]]'' in September 2008, their tenth studio album and their first on [[Nuclear Blast]]. Terrorizer Magazine named it the album of the year in 2008, notably above other metal releases such as [[Meshuggah]]'s ''[[obZen]]'' and [[Opeth]]'s ''[[Watershed (Opeth album)|Watershed]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/enslaved-s-vertebrae-crowned-terrorizer-magazine-s-album-of-the-year/|title=ENSLAVED's 'Vertebrae' Crowned TERRORIZER Magazine's 'Album of the Year'|date=31 December 2008|work=Blabbermouth.net|access-date=17 March 2014}}</ref> After touring Europe extensively, Enslaved embarked on a North American tour with the progressive death metal band [[Opeth]] in May 2009.<ref name="Enslaved Events">{{cite web|url=http://www.enslaved.no/index.php?module=events |title=Enslaved Events |publisher=Enslaved.no |access-date=15 July 2011}}</ref> The album is noted for its shift in its approach and its diverse sounds; Sammy O'Hagar from MetalSucks.net even says that "to call [Vertebrae] black metal would be quite a stretch" because "there's an impressive depth to [it] that surpasses the sour misanthropy so often (and rightfully) associated with the genre", and furthermore describing their sound as "heavy and surprisingly soft, focused and curious, true to their roots and longing to forget them".<ref name="metalsucks">{{cite web|last=O'Hagar|first=Sammy |title=Enslaved's Vertebrae: The Sound of a Band at the Top of Their Game|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2008/09/17/enslaveds-vertebrae-the-sound-of-a-band-at-the-top-of-their-game/|work=MetalSucks.net|access-date=17 March 2014}}</ref> The album's sound has been said to be akin to [[Pink Floyd]]'s sound on a few occasions,<ref name=metalsucks /><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Enslaved - Vertebrae: A Momentary Lapse in Norwegian?|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/reviews/Enslaved/Vertebrae/207825/|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Metallum|publisher=marktheviktor|access-date=17 March 2014}}</ref> as well as other black metal releases in a similar vein.<ref>{{cite web|last=Metzengerstein|first=Frederick|title=Nachtmysium's Assassins: Black Meddle Part 1 is a Solid Link between Psychedelia and Black Metal|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/27339/Enslaved-Vertebrae/|work=Sputnik Music|access-date=17 March 2014}}</ref>

== Musical style and influence ==
The band's early music was rooted in traditional black metal and Viking metal, however the band moved away from this sound with 2001's ''[[Monumension]]'' and 2003's ''[[Below the Lights]]''. It was at this point that the band was reduced to its two founding members, Bjørnson and Kjellson. They began to incorporate elements of progressive rock, jazz, and other distinct influences into their sound, and over time have continued this progression.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://crypticrock.com/interview-grutle-kjellson-of-enslaved/|title=Interview – Grutle Kjellson of Enslaved|access-date=6 November 2016}}</ref> Kjellson has named [[Pink Floyd]], [[King Crimson]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[Darkthrone]], early [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], and [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] as important influences on the band's sound.<ref name="metalsucks.net"/>
