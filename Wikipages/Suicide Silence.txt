==History==

===Formation, debut EP and ''The Cleansing'' (2002–2008)===
Suicide Silence was founded in 2002 at [[Riverside, California|Riverside]], [[California]]. At the time, it was a side project made up of musicians from other bands. The band's first release was in 2003 the ''Death Awaits'' [[demo (music)|demo]].<ref name="SS Story by Revolver">{{Cite journal |last=Wiederhorn |first=John |date=September 2009 |title=Bleeding Edge: Suicide Silence |journal=[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]] |location=[[South San Francisco]], [[California]] |publisher=[[Future US]] |issue=84 |pages=49–52 |issn=1527-408X}}</ref> After ''Death Awaits'' was completed, the band began recording a second demo, which was released in 2004 and introduced 3new members: Josh Goddard replacing Justin Tufano on drums, Mike Olheiser replacing Chris Grucelski on bass, and Mitch Lucker repealing Tanner Womack on vocals. It was by this time, the band members began committing more time to Suicide Silence. Soon after, they recorded and released their first EP backed by a label; [[Suicide Silence (EP)|a self-titled EP]] which was released in 2005. It was initially released by Third Degree Records, and later re-released in the UK through In at the Deep End Records.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Suicide Silence Completes Work On Debut Album |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=70194 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181710/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=70194 |archive-date=September 30, 2007 |access-date=April 15, 2007}}</ref> This EP would see Chris Garza as the only original member left, as it featured new guitarist Rick Ash who replaced Josh Tufano. Rick would not stick around for too long, and was replaced by Mark Heylum who remains to this day. 2006 marked the departure of drummer Josh Goddard, who was replaced by Alex Lopez (ex-guitarist for Blacheart Eulogy and [[The Funeral Pyre]]). 

Following these events, the band recorded six [[pre-production]] songs while in the process of signing with [[Century Media Records]] in 2006 which led to their then upcoming full-length album debut: ''[[The Cleansing (album)|The Cleansing]]''. The album was written, recorded, and completed in 2007<ref>{{Cite web |title=Century Media Records |url=http://www.centurymedia.com/us/news.php?artist_ID=100 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105150244/http://www.centurymedia.com/us/news.php?artist_ID=100 |archive-date=November 5, 2007 |access-date=April 15, 2007 |website=Century Media Records Welcomes Suicide Silence to Its Worldwide Family}}</ref> and was recorded in Los Angeles with engineer [[John Travis (producer)|John Travis]] and was produced and mixed by [[Tue Madsen]].
