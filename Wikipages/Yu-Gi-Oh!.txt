{{nihongo|'''''Yu-Gi-Oh!'''''|遊☆戯☆王|Yū-Gi-Ō!|[[Literal translation|lit.]] "King of Games"|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[manga]] series about [[trading card game|trading card gaming]] written and illustrated by [[Kazuki Takahashi]]. It was serialized in [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'' magazine between September 1996 and March 2004. The plot follows the story of a boy named [[Yugi Mutou]], who solves the ancient Millennium Puzzle. Yugi awakens a gambling alter-ego or spirit within his body that solves his conflicts using various games.

The manga series has spawned a [[media franchise]] that includes multiple spin-off manga and [[anime]] series, a [[Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game|trading card game]], and numerous video games. Most of these incarnations involve the fictional trading card game known as ''Duel Monsters'', where each player uses cards to "duel" each other in a mock battle of fantasy "monsters", forming the basis for the real life ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game]]'' tie in. The manga was adapted into two anime series; the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (1998 TV series)|first anime adaptation]] was produced by [[Toei Animation]], which aired from April to October 1998, while the second, produced by [[Nihon Ad Systems|NAS]] and animated by [[Gallop (studio)|Studio Gallop]] titled ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters]]'', aired between April 2000 and September 2004. ''Yu-Gi-Oh'' has since become one of the [[List of highest-grossing media franchises|highest-grossing media franchises]] of all time.

==Plot==
{{see also|List of Yu-Gi-Oh! characters}}
''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' tells the tale of [[Yugi Mutou]], a timid young boy who loves all sorts of games, but is often bullied around. One day, he solves an ancient puzzle known as the {{nihongo|Millennium Puzzle|千年パズル|Sennen Pazuru}}, causing his body to play host to a mysterious spirit with the personality of a gambler. From that moment onwards, whenever Yugi or one of his friends is threatened by those with darkness in their hearts, this other Yugi shows himself and challenges them to dangerous {{nihongo|Shadow Games|闇のゲーム|Yami no Gēmu|lit. "Games of Darkness"}} which reveal the true nature of someone's heart, the losers of these contests often being subjected to a dark punishment called a {{nihongo|Penalty Game|罰ゲーム|Batsu Gēmu}}. Whether it be cards, dice, or role-playing board games, he will take on challenges from anyone, anywhere.

As the series progresses, Yugi and his friends learn that this person inside of his puzzle is actually the spirit of a nameless [[Pharaoh]] from Ancient Egyptian times, who had lost his memories. As Yugi and his companions attempt to help the Pharaoh regain his memories, they find themselves going through many trials as they wager their lives facing off against gamers that wield the mysterious {{nihongo|Millennium Items|千年アイテム|Sennen Aitemu}} and the dark power of the Shadow Games.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Yu-Gi-Oh!

==Development==
In the initial planning stages of the manga, Takahashi had wanted to draw a horror manga.<ref>''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' (Japanese) Volume 36 ''Foreword''. 2004. ''[[Kazuki Takahashi (manga artist)|Kazuki Takahashi]]''</ref> Although the end result was a manga about games, it was clear that some horror elements influenced certain aspects of the story. Takahashi decided to use "battle" as his primary theme. Since there had been so much "fighting" manga, he found it difficult to come up with something original. He decided to create a fighting manga where the main character does not hit anybody, but also struggled with that limitation. When the word "game" came to mind, he found it much easier to work with.<ref>''Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist'' Volume 9. ''Foreword.'' ''[[Viz Media]]''</ref>

When an interviewer asked Takahashi if he tried to introduce younger readers to real life gaming culture referenced in the series, Takahashi responded by saying that he simply included "stuff he played and enjoyed", and that it may have introduced readers to role-playing games and other games. Takahashi added that he created some of the games seen in the series. The author stressed the importance of "communication between people," often present in tabletop role-playing games and not present in solitary video games. Takahashi added that he feels that quality communication is not possible over the Internet.<ref name="SJVolume2Issue8InterviewPage140">''Shonen Jump''. Volume 2, Issue 8. August 2004. ''VIZ Media''. 140.</ref>

Takahashi had always been interested in games, claiming to have been obsessed as a child and is still interested in them as an adult. In a game, he considered the player to become a hero. He decided to base the ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' series around such games and used this idea as the premise; Yugi was a weak childish boy, who became a hero when he played games. With friendship being one of the major themes of ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'', he based the names of the two major characters "Yūgi" and "Jōnouchi" on the word yūjō (友情), which means "friendship". Henshin, the ability to turn into something or someone else, is something Takahashi believed all children dreamed of. He considered Yugi's "henshin" Dark Yugi, a savvy, invincible games player, to be a big appeal to children.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Takeuchi Cullen, Lisa |title='I've Always Been Obsessed With Games' |url=http://www.time.com:80/time/interactive/multimedia/takahashi_int/frameset.exclude.html |url-status=dead |magazine=[[Time Asia]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020702174238/http://www.time.com:80/time/interactive/multimedia/takahashi_int/frameset.exclude.html |archive-date=July 2, 2002 |access-date=November 13, 2018 |quote=In a game, the player becomes the hero. [...] The main character, Yugi, is a weak and childish boy who becomes a hero when he plays games. [...] As far as the manga story goes, I think all kids dream of henshin [...] if you combine the "yu" in Yugi and the "jo" in Jounouchi [...] Yujo translates to friendship in English, [...]}}</ref>

Takahashi said that the card game held the strongest influence in the manga, because it "happened to evoke the most response" from readers. Prior to that point, Takahashi did not plan for the card game to make more than two appearances.<ref name="SJVolume2Issue9InterviewPage8">''Shonen Jump''. Volume 2, Issue 9. September 2004. ''VIZ Media''. 8.</ref>

Takahashi said that the "positive message" for readers of the series is that each person has a "strong hidden part" (like "human potential") within himself or herself, and when one finds hardship, the "hidden part" can emerge if one believes in him/herself and in his/her friends. Takahashi added that this is "a pretty consistent theme."<ref name="SJVolume2Issue9InterviewPage8" />

The editor of the English version, [[Jason Thompson (writer)|Jason Thompson]], said that the licensing of the ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' manga had not been entirely coordinated, so Viz decided to use many of the original character names and to "keep it more or less violent and gory." Thompson said that the manga "was almost unchanged from the Japanese original." Because the core fanbase of the series was, according to Thompson, "8-year-old boys (and a few incredible fangirls)," and because the series had little interest from "hardcore, Japanese-speaking fans, the kind who run scanlation sites and post on messageboards" as the series was perceived to be "too mainstream," the Viz editors allowed Thompson "a surprising amount of leeway with the translation." Thompson said he hoped that he did not "abuse" the leeway he was given.<ref name="Comixologyinterview">"[https://pulllist.comixology.com/articles/63/To-All-the-Manga-Ive-Edited-Before To All the Manga I've Edited Before] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208065514/https://pulllist.comixology.com/articles/63/To-All-the-Manga-Ive-Edited-Before|date=December 8, 2015 }}." [[Comixology]]. May 22, 2008. Last retrieved on December 1, 2015.</ref> In a 2004 interview, the editors of the United States ''Shonen Jump'' mentioned that Americans were surprised when reading the stories in Volumes 1 through 7, as they had not appeared on television as a part of the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters]]'' anime. Takahashi added "The story is quite violent, isn't it? ''[laughs]''"<ref name="SJVolume2Issue9InterviewPage8" />

The English language release by 4Kids has been subject to censorship to make it more appropriate for children, for example mentions of death or violence were replaced by references to "being sent to the Shadow Realm".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Anime Censorship in the 90s and Early 2000s {{!}} Comic Book Legal Defense Fund |url=http://cbldf.org/2019/03/anime-censorship-in-the-early-2000s/ |access-date=2019-12-08 |language=en-US}}</ref>

The 遊戯王 (''Yugiō''), which is stylized 遊☆戯☆王, means "king of games". The word 遊戯 (''yugi'', game) is also the name of the protagonist. [[Kazuki Takahashi]] has also stated{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} that the character names "Yūgi" and "[[List of Yu-Gi-Oh! characters#Katsuya Jonouchi|Jōnouchi]]" are based on the word 友情 (''yūjō'' "friendship"). This pun was represented with a [[Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game]] card known 友情 YU-JYO (''Yūjō Yūjō''; in English, "Yu-Jo Friendship"). ''Yūjō'' is pointed out by Jōnouchi to Yūgi at the end of the first manga chapter, as "something visible yet invisible" (what's visible is the two of them, what's invisible is their friendship), as a way to tell Yūgi that he wants to be his friend.

==Publication==
{{main|List of Yu-Gi-Oh! chapters}}
The original ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' manga by [[Kazuki Takahashi (manga artist)|Kazuki Takahashi]] was serialized in [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'' from September 30, 1996 to March 8, 2004. Unlike most other media, it features a variety of different games. The plot starts out fairly episodic and the first seven volumes includes only three instances of ''Magic & Wizards''. In the sixtieth chapter, the Duelist Kingdom arc starts and instances of ''Magic & Wizards'' becomes fairly common, and after the DDD arc, it reappears again and becomes part of an important plot point during the Battle City arc. The last arc of the manga focuses on a [[tabletop role-playing game]] that replicates the Pharaoh's lost memories, in which the battle system is based on an ancient Shadow Game played in his kingdom (stated in-series to be the precursor of ''Magic & Wizards'' and the indirect precursor to card games in general). The editors were Yoshihisa Heishi and Hisao Shimada. Kazuki Takahashi credits Toshimasa Takahashi in the "Special Thanks" column.<ref>''Yu-Gi-Oh! Millennium World'' Volume 7. [[VIZ Media]]. 218.</ref>

The English version of the ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' manga was released in the [[North America]] by [[Viz Media]], running in ''[[Shonen Jump (magazine)|Shonen Jump]]'' magazine between 2002 and December 2007. The original Japanese character names are kept for most of the characters (Yugi, Jonouchi, Anzu, and Honda, for instance), while the English names are used for a minor number of characters (e.g. [[List of Yu-Gi-Oh! characters#Maximillion Pegasus|Maximillion Pegasus]]) and for the ''Duel Monsters'' cards. Though largely unedited, several instances of censorship appear (such as editing out [[Finger (gesture)|the finger gesture]] in later volumes). Viz released the first volume of the ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' manga up to the end of the Monster World arc under its original title. Starting from the last chapter of the seventh Japanese volume, the "Duelist Kingdom", "Dungeon Dice Monsters", and "Battle City" arcs are released under the title ''Yu-Gi-Oh!: Duelist''; the "Memory World" arc was released under the ''Yu-Gi-Oh!: Millennium World'' title. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Other media==
===''Yu-Gi-Oh! R''===
{{main|Yu-Gi-Oh! R}}
A spin-off manga titled ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! R]]'' was illustrated by [[Akira Ito (manga artist)|Akira Ito]] under Takahashi's supervision. The story is of disputed canonicity and takes place in the original manga's universe, between the Battle City and Millennium World arcs, where Yugi and his friends must stop a man named Yako Tenma who plans to use Anzu Mazaki's body to revive the deceased Pegasus.<ref>In volume 1 of the ''Yu-Gi-Oh! R'' manga, Akira Ito explains the manga, which describes a hidden story that does not appear in the original ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' manga, as a {{nihongo|"reverse"|リバース|ribāsu}} of the original one, in an effort to expand the ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' franchise.</ref> The spin-off was serialized in ''V-Jump'' between April 21, 2004 and December 21, 2007 and was compiled into five tankōbon volumes. Viz Media released the series in North America between 2009 and 2010.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Viz Adds Yu-Gi-Oh!

====''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' (1998 TV series)====
{{Main|List of Yu-Gi-Oh! (1998) episodes}}
The first ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' anime adaptation was produced by [[Toei Animation]] and aired on [[TV Asahi]] between April 4, 1998 and October 10, 1998,<ref>{{Cite web |date=May 23, 1998 |script-title=ja:番組表 |url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/bangumi/index.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980523065859/http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/bangumi/index.html |archive-date=May 23, 1998 |access-date=June 1, 2009 |publisher=[[TV Asahi]] |language=ja}}</ref> running for 27 episodes and one theatrical movie released on the 6th March, 1999. This adaptation was never released outside Japan.

This series is heavily [[abridgement|abridged]] from the manga, skipping many chapters, and often changes details of the manga stories it does adapt, featuring several key differences from the manga. It also adds a new regular character to the group, Miho Nosaka, who was originally a one-shot minor character in the manga. This adaptation is not related to any other works in the franchise.

====''Duel Monsters'' (2000 TV series)====
{{Main|Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters}}
''Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters'', known outside Japan as simply ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'', is the second adaptation of the series. It was produced by [[Nihon Ad Systems]] and [[TV Tokyo]], while animation for the show was done by [[Gallop (studio)|Studio Gallop]]. Loosely adapting the manga from chapter sixty onwards, the series features several differences from the manga and the Toei-produced series and largely focuses around the game of Duel Monsters, tying in with the real life ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game]]''. The series aired in Japan on TV Tokyo between April 18, 2000 and September 29, 2004, running for 224 episodes. A remastered version of the series, focusing on specific duels, began airing in Japan from February 7, 2015.<ref>{{Cite news |date=December 22, 2014 |title=2016 Yu-Gi-Oh!

In 2001, [[4Kids Entertainment]] obtained the merchandising and television rights to the series from Nihon Ad Systems, producing an English-language version which aired in North America on [[Kids' WB!]] between September 29, 2001 and June 10, 2006, also releasing in various countries outside Japan. The adaptation received many changes from the Japanese version to tailor it for international audiences. These include different names for many characters and monsters, changes to the appearance of the cards to differentiate them from their real-life counterparts and various cuts and edits pertaining to violence, death, and religious references to make the series suitable for children.

An album containing some tracks from the English dub music entitled '''''Yu-Gi-Oh! Music to Duel By''''' was released on October 29, 2002 on [[DreamWorks Records]] on [[Compact Disc|Audio CD]] and [[Compact Cassette]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=October 3, 2002 |title=4Kids Entertainment and DreamWorks Records Sign Yu-Gi-Oh!

An uncut version, featuring an all-new English dub track and the original Japanese audio, began release in October 2004, in association with [[Funimation Entertainment]]. Only three volumes, comprising the first nine episodes, were ever released. 4Kids would later release the uncut Japanese episodes on [[YouTube]], in May 2009, but were forced to stop due to legal issues with [[ADK (company)|ADK]] and Yugi's Japanese voice actor, [[Shunsuke Kazama]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=August 24, 2009 |title=Removal of Yu-Gi-Oh!

====''Capsule Monsters''====
{{Main|List of Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monsters episodes}}
''Yu-Gi-Oh!

It is set before the end of ''Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters'', apparently somewhere between episodes 198 and 199, and involves Yugi and his friends being pulled into a world filled with real Duel Monsters they can summon using capsules. It is similar to the Virtual RPG arc in many respects, but it does not seem to have anything to do with the early Capsule Monster Chess game featured in early volumes of the original manga. It is currently the only animated ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' media not to be released in Japan, though it is referred to as ''Yu-Gi-Oh! ALEX''. A DVD containing a condensed version of the ''Capsule Monsters'' episodes was released in May 2006.<ref>{{Cite news |date=April 19, 2006 |title=Yu-Gi-Oh Capsule Monsters DVD in May |work=[[Anime News Network]] |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/article.php?id=8742}}</ref>

===Novel===
A novel adaptation revolves focuses on some of the beginning parts of the manga and the Death-T arc, written by Katsuhiko Chiba (千葉 克彦 ''Chiba Katsuhiko''). It was published in Japan by [[Shueisha]] on September 3, 1999 and has four sections.<ref>{{Cite web |title=遊・戯・王 &#91;Yu-Gi-Oh&#93 |url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=4-08-703086-5 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195443/http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=4-08-703086-5 |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |access-date=January 26, 2013 |publisher=[[Shueisha]]}}</ref> The fourth section is an original story, occurring only in the novel. Two weeks after Yugi's battle with Kaiba in Death-T, Yugi gets a call from Kaiba, who tells him to meet for a game at the top floor of Kaiba Corporation. Yugi accepts, and when the game begins, they use a special variation of ''Magic & Wizards'' called the "Bingo Rule," which prevents the used of a specific card in each player's deck. Mokuba stumbles in on them, and tells Yugi that Kaiba has not yet awoken from his catatonic state. It turns out that the Kaiba that Yugi is playing against is a "Cyber Kaiba", controlled by the KaibaCorp computer, using all of Kaiba's memories.

''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX'', known in Japan as ''Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters GX'', is the first spin-off anime series produced by NAS which ran for 180 episodes from October 6, 2004 and March 26, 2008. Taking place a few years after the events of ''Yu-Gi-Oh!

Like the previous seasons, 4Kids Entertainment licensed the series outside Japan and aired it in North America between October 10, 2005 and July 12, 2008, though episodes 157–180 were not dubbed.

A manga adaptation by [[Naoyuki Kageyama]] was serialized in Shueisha's ''V-Jump'' magazine between December 17, 2005 and March 19, 2011.

John Jakala of ''[[Anime News Network]]'' reviewed the ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' manga in 2003 as part of reviewing the U.S. ''[[Shonen Jump (magazine)|Shonen Jump]]''. Jakala said that while the commercials for the second series anime made the anime appear "completely uninteresting," the comic "is unexpectedly dark and moody." Jakala added that at one moment the series "reminded me of [[Neil Gaiman]]'s work: Yugi finds himself drawn into a magical world of ancient forces where there are definite rules that must be obeyed." Jakala concluded that the fact the series uses games as plot devices "opens up a lot of story possibilities" and that he feared that the series had the potential to "simply devolve into a tie-in for the popular card game."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Jakala |first=John |date=January 2, 2003 |title=''Shonen Jump'' Volume 1 Review |work=Anime News Network |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/shonen-jump-1 |url-status=live |access-date=May 23, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211212951/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/shonen-jump-1 |archive-date=February 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

[[Jason Thompson (writer)|Jason Thompson]], the editor of the English version of the manga, ranked ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' as number three of his five personal favorite series to edit, stating that he thinks "the story is actually pretty solid for a shonen manga" and that "you can tell it was written by an older man because of the obsession with death, and what might come after death, which dominates the final story arc," enjoying all the RPG and card gaming terminology found within the series.<ref name="Comixologyinterview" />

At the time when the manga series started to garner more popularity among Japanese children with the second series anime, video games, and trading card game, because of its somewhat "dark story lines, leggy girls and terrifying monsters", the series was not popular among Japanese parents, who believed that ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' was more meant for teenagers than the young kids that make up the audience for franchises such as ''[[Pokémon]]''.<ref name="Time Magazine 2001">{{Cite magazine |last=Takeuchi Cullen, Lisa |date=June 4, 2001 |title=Crouching lizard |url=http://www.time.com:80/time/interactive/entertainment/yugioh_np.html |url-status=dead |magazine=[[Time Asia]] |volume=157 |issue=22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010913025830/http://www.time.com:80/time/interactive/entertainment/yugioh_np.html |archive-date=September 13, 2001 |access-date=November 13, 2018}}</ref>
