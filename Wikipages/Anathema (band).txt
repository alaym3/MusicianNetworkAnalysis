'''Anathema''' were an English [[rock music|rock]] band from [[Liverpool]]. The group was formed in 1990 by [[Vincent Cavanagh|Vincent]] and [[Daniel Cavanagh]], bassist Jamie Cavanagh, drummer/keyboardist John Douglas, and vocalist Darren White.

The band maintained an active concert schedule throughout their career. They first toured in 1992 with the American death metal band [[Cannibal Corpse]]; they since performed throughout Europe, the United States, Central America, Australia,<ref>{{Cite web|title=LIVE REVIEW: Anathema – Perth, December 10th 2017 – The Rockpit|date=11 December 2017|url=https://www.therockpit.net/2017/live-review-anathema-perth-december-10th-2017/|access-date=2021-02-17|language=en-US}}</ref> New Zealand, India,<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|date=2012-12-05|title=Backstage With Vincent Cavanagh -|url=https://rollingstoneindia.com/backstage-with-vincent-cavanagh/|access-date=2021-02-17|language=en-US}}</ref> and Turkey.

==History==

===Early years: ''Serenades''  and ''The Silent Enigma''===
Anathema formed in 1990 as a [[doom metal]] band, initially going by the name Pagan Angel.<ref name=Larkin>Larkin, Colin (1999), ''The Virgin Encyclopedia of Heavy Rock''. p. 27. Virgin Books. {{ISBN|0-7535-0257-7}}.</ref> In November of that year, the band recorded their first demo, entitled ''An Iliad of Woes''.<ref name=Larkin/> This demo caught the attention of several bands and labels from the English metal scene.

}}

At the beginning of 1991, the band gained a lot of attention with the release of their second demo entitled ''All Faith Is Lost'', resulting in a four-album deal with [[Peaceville Records]].<ref name=Larkin/> Their first release under the label was ''[[The Crestfallen]]'' EP in November 1992. They took the material from that album on the road, touring with [[Cannibal Corpse]].

''[[Serenades (album)|Serenades]]'', Anathema's debut LP, attracted a lot of mainstream attention, propelling their "Sweet Tears" music video onto the [[MTV]] playlist. Anathema's first European tour was in 1994, and was closely followed by gigs at the Independent Rock Festival in Brazil.

In May 1995, vocalist [[Darren "Daz" White|Darren White]] parted with the band, eventually forming [[The Blood Divine]].<ref name=Larkin/> Rather than recruiting a new vocalist, the band decided that guitarist [[Vincent Cavanagh]] should assume White's role.<ref name=Strong>Strong, Martin C. (2001). ''The Great Metal Discography''. pp. 25–6. MOJO Books. {{ISBN|1-84195-185-4}}.</ref> This new formation debuted by touring with [[Cathedral (band)|Cathedral]] in the United Kingdom, and released ''[[The Silent Enigma]]'' soon after.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-silent-enigma-mw0000031072/releases|title=Anathema The Silent Enigma|website=allmusic.com|access-date=10 September 2021}}</ref> It also showed the band starting to take a direction akin to [[gothic metal]].

===Mid-1990s: ''Eternity'', ''Alternative 4'', and ''Judgement'' ===
The next member to leave the band was drummer John Douglas, who departed in the summer of 1997. He was replaced by [[Shaun Steels]], formerly of [[Solstice (UK doom metal band)|Solstice]], who would also later play drums for [[My Dying Bride]].<ref name=Strong/>
The release of ''[[Eternity (Anathema album)|Eternity]]'' came in 1996, relying more on atmospheric sounds, and starting the transition to clean vocals;<ref name=Strong/> the album ''[[Judgement (Anathema album)|Judgement]]'' would later consolidate this style. A European tour followed the album's release.

''[[Alternative 4 (album)|Alternative 4]]'' was released in 1998. During this time the band underwent many line-up changes. Bassist/keyboardist/songwriter [[Duncan Patterson]] quit due to musical differences and was replaced by [[Dave Pybus]] of Dreambreed, a band which Duncan had played bass for during a short period,<ref name=Strong/> and not long after this [[Martin Powell]] (who had played keyboards and violin for My Dying Bride previously) joined the band for live performances. Finally, founding drummer John Douglas returned to the drums in place of Steels.<ref name=Strong/>

In June 1999, the album ''[[Judgement (Anathema album)|Judgement]]'' was released, marking Anathema's complete shift from the doom metal genre, focusing instead on slower and more experimental songs. This new sound has been likened to artists such as [[Pink Floyd]], [[Jeff Buckley]], and to a lesser extent, [[Radiohead]]. Their songs continued to express a feeling of depression and, more often than not, desperation.

===2000s: ''A Fine Day to Exit'' and ''A Natural Disaster''===
[[File:Anathema 2005.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Anathema in concert at Istanbul [[Cemil Topuzlu Harbiye Amphitheatre]] in 2005]]
In 2000, Martin Powell switched positions with [[Cradle of Filth]]'s keyboardist [[Les Smith]], who came to be an integral member of Anathema.

Shortly before the release of ''[[A Fine Day to Exit]]'', [[Dave Pybus]] announced his departure from the band and later joined [[Cradle of Filth]]. He was replaced by touring bassist George Roberts, and later by Jamie Cavanagh.

In March 2002, [[Daniel Cavanagh]] announced his departure from the band, joining Duncan Patterson's band [[Antimatter (band)|Antimatter]]. However, he later rejoined Anathema in 2003 for the release of ''[[A Natural Disaster (album)|A Natural Disaster]]'', and started their European tour. This accelerated the changes in Anathema's tone, towards the atmospheric and progressive, as exhibited in album tracks "Flying" and "Violence".

Upon the closing of their label [[Music for Nations]] after its purchase by [[Sony BMG]], Anathema found itself without a record label, despite having completed an extensive tour of the UK with popular Finnish rock band [[HIM (Finnish band)|HIM]] in April 2006. During their search for a new label, the band adopted a more '[[DIY ethic|DIY]]' approach to music release, embracing the internet and releasing songs via their own website, for which fans may donate a monetary sum of their own choice. Despite the obvious lack of label-based tour support, the band continued to play dates across Europe, and guitarist [[Danny Cavanagh]] also playing the odd low-key acoustic concert.

===2010s: ''We're Here Because We're Here'' and ''Weather Systems''===
[[File:Lee Douglas 01.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Lee Douglas, John Douglas' sister, formally joined the band as a singer after some guest appearances.]]
On 20 March 2010, Anathema announced on their website<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anathema.ws |title=Anathema |publisher=Anathema.ws |access-date=20 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619034057/http://www.anathema.ws/ |archive-date=19 June 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and Facebook page<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/anathemamusic |title=Anathema official Facebook page|website=Facebook.com|access-date=22 January 2018}}</ref> the release date of their next album. ''[[We're Here Because We're Here (album)|We're Here Because We're Here]]'' was released on 31 May 2010 on the [[Kscope]] label. John Douglas' sister Lee Douglas joined the band in the capacity of a vocalist during the recording of this album. She had previously performed on the two previous albums as a guest vocalist.

On 6 July 2011, it was announced on the band's official page that their album of re-interpretations, ''[[Falling Deeper (Anathema album)|Falling Deeper]]'', would be released on 5 September 2011. The album was a follow-up to ''[[Hindsight (Anathema album)|Hindsight]]'' and contained new orchestral versions of songs from the past, as well as a version of "Everwake" featuring the vocals of [[Anneke van Giersbergen]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Anathema's official website news |url=http://www.anathema.ws/news.cfm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720183049/http://www.anathema.ws/news.cfm |archive-date=20 July 2011 }}</ref> On 12 September 2011, Les Smith's departure due to "creative and musical differences" was announced on the band's website.

On 16 April 2012, the band's ninth studio album, ''[[Weather Systems (Anathema album)|Weather Systems]]'', was released via [[Kscope]]. The album entered the UK album charts at No. 50 and the German album charts at No. 19.

On 8 November 2012, [[Daniel Cavanagh]] announced on Anathema's official website that [[Daniel Cardoso]] was joining in a full-time permanent basis, as a key element of the band. Cardoso and John Douglas both switch positions of keyboardist and drummer respectively.<ref>{{cite web|title=Anathema's official website news - BREAKING NEWS: DANIEL CARDOSO TO BECOME PERMANENT MEMBER OF ANATHEMA |url=http://www.anathema.ws/news.cfm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113080435/http://www.anathema.ws/news.cfm |archive-date=13 November 2012 }}</ref>

On 2 December 2012, Anathema announced their first concert in India. Anathema has performed at [[IIT Madras]] as part of the [[Saarang]] Rock Show on 12 January 2013.<ref name=":0" />

The band's live album, named ''Universal'', was released as a double vinyl album on 24 June 2013. The album is a recording of a special one-off gig at the [[Plovdiv Roman theatre|ancient Roman theatre]] of [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]] in 2012, where the band were joined by the [[Plovdiv Philharmonic Orchestra]]. The set was released on Blu-ray, DVD and CD under the name ''Universal'', with an alternate track order, on 17 September 2013.

The band performed on drummer Mike Portnoy's Progression Nation at Sea tour aboard the Norwegian Cruise Line ship ''Pearl'' that sailed from the Port of Miami on 18 February 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noisefull.com/interviews/anathema-vincent-cavanagh|title=Anathema (Vincent Cavanagh)|website=Noisefull.com|access-date=22 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123073626/http://noisefull.com/interviews/anathema-vincent-cavanagh|archive-date=23 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===''Distant Satellites,'' ''The Optimist'', and indefinite hiatus===
On 28 March 2014, the band announced their upcoming studio album would be called ''[[Distant Satellites]]''. The album came out on 9 June 2014 on the [[Kscope]] label, and was produced by Christer-André Cederberg in Oslo, Norway. Several tracks were mixed by Steven Wilson (of [[Porcupine Tree]]). Different from previous albums is the use of more [[electronica]] on this album. The album was released in four different versions: CD, vinyl, media book, and a deluxe version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://omerch.eu/shop/anathema|title=Anathema - Shop|website=Omerch.eu|access-date=22 January 2018}}</ref> The band toured the album starting 22 May in Istanbul, Turkey, continuing throughout Europe and travelling to Australia for the first time to perform three dates during August 2014.

Following the success of their short Australian tour, an acoustic tour was announced for New Zealand and Australia in 2015. Daniel, Vincent and Lee performed these show without the other band members. Later that year, the band released an acoustic live album and video entitled ''A Sort of Homecoming'', consisting in the record of a concert at the band's hometown [[Liverpool Cathedral]]. In 2017, the band released ''[[The Optimist (Anathema album)|The Optimist]]'', which won Album of the Year at the Progressive Music Awards.<ref name="munro"/>

At the end of August 2019, it was announced that Anathema would be leaving the Kscope record label and had signed a new deal with [[Mascot Label Group]]. Anathema planned to release their 12th studio album in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/anathema-sign-with-mascot-label-group-2020-album-planned|title=Anathema sign with Mascot Label Group and plan 2020 album|website=[[Louder Sound]]|last=Munro|first=Scott|date=28 August 2019|access-date=4 September 2019}}</ref> However, Anathema announced an indefinite hiatus on 22 September 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Anathema|url=https://www.facebook.com/anathemamusic/posts/10158682760833629|access-date=2020-09-22|website=www.facebook.com|language=en}}</ref>
