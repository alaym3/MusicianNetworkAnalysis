'''The 69 Eyes''' are Finnish [[Rock music|rock]] band. It was founded in 1989 in [[Helsinki]] by vocalist Jyrki 69 (who also writes the band's lyrics), guitarists Bazie, Timo-Timo and bassist Archzie, joined in 1992 by drummer Jussi 69; the lineup never changed since then. The 69 Eyes music blends [[gothic rock]] with [[glam metal]] and [[rock'n'roll]] in a style that was dubbed "goth'n'roll". 

The 69 Eyes is currently signed to [[EMI]] Finland. The band's albums are now distributed worldwide; The End Records acts as the band's official North American distributor, as [[Nuclear Blast Records]] provides distribution in Europe. Australia will be handled by AmpHead Music. All Asian and Latin American releases are handled by EMI affiliates.

==Music style==
[[File:Jyrki 69.jpg|thumb|250px|Vocalist Jyrki 69]]
Initially, The 69 Eyes' music style was of [[glam metal]] influenced by acts such as [[Mötley Crüe]] and [[Hanoi Rocks]]. However, they began to incorporate more influence from [[gothic rock]] bands such as [[The Mission UK|The Mission]], [[The Cult]], [[The Sisters of Mercy]] and [[The Lords of the New Church]]. Their sound was described as a mix of the gloominess of gothic rock with guitar-powered [[rock 'n' roll]].<ref name="Billboard1">[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the 69 eyes|chart=all}}w]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref> Their music continued to show further influence from other rock artists such as [[The Doors]], [[Elvis Presley]], and [[Billy Idol]] as well as vampire films and literature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.69eyes.com/angelsite/biography/|title=The 69 Eyes † Biography|access-date=19 September 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109185527/http://www.69eyes.com/angelsite/biography/|archive-date=9 January 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The term "goth 'n roll" is used by fans to describe their style. They are often described as a [[dark rock]] band,<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Jonathan|last=Mander|title=Finland Sets Midem Opener|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-xQEAAAAMBAJ&q=++%22dark+rock%22&pg=PA20 |magazine=Billboard Magazine|date=November 2005|page=20}}</ref> a term which the band has embraced.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Interview mit The 69 Eyes|year=2002|url=http://www.earshot.at/php/content/interviews_ok.php?action=show&idx=179|quote=Sie nahmen den Punk Weg, wir den Dark Rock. [They took the punk road, we chose the Dark Rock way.]|language=de}}</ref> In recent times, with the release of ''[[Back in Blood (The 69 Eyes album)|Back in Blood]]'', The 69 Eyes have moved back to a more guitar-based sound, although gothic imagery and lyrical themes remain forefront in their style.

==Band history==
Formed in the bars of [[Helsinki]], Finland in the summer of 1989 by Jyrki 69, Archzie (formerly of Syyskuu), Timo-Timo, Lotto and Bazie, The 69 Eyes originally had a [[glam metal]] style and were compared to other Finnish glam metal acts such as Smack and Hanoi Rocks.
The band's lineup has stayed the same since 1992 when drummer Jussi 69 replaced original drummer Lotto who had played on the band's first two 7" vinyl singles.

===1989–1999===
The band released their first 7" EP, "Sugarman", in 1990, followed by another 7", "Barbarella" in 1991. These are the only two releases that do not feature Jussi. These releases paved the way for the band's first album ''[[Bump 'n' Grind (The 69 Eyes album)|Bump 'n' Grind]]'' released in 1992 which contained some re-recorded versions of songs from the first two EPs. This same year, the band released their final two 7" EPs, titled "Juicy Lucy" and "High Times Low Lives".

The band's second CD "[[Motor City Resurrection]]" was released in 1994 via Japanese Label 1+2 Records. It has since been re-released with eight bonus tracks worldwide. Though not a full-length release, but rather a compilation album (much like Hanoi Rocks' [[Self Destruction Blues]]), it collected the majority of the band's early material and contributions to other compilations.
It was followed in 1995 by ''[[Savage Garden (69 Eyes album)|Savage Garden]]'' which featured Hanoi Rocks guitarist Andy McCoy on the track "Wild Talk".
Also released during this time were two VHS tapes "Motor City Resurrection" and "Savage Tales" available only through the band's self-run fan club (the aptly titled "Get Down to 69") which are seen rarely, if ever for sale online.

1997 saw the release of ''[[Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams (album)|Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams]]'', which fans generally mark as the last 69 Eyes "glam-era" album. The title track of this album was re-recorded for the Angels album 10 years later.
The goth rock infused ''[[Wasting the Dawn]]'' was released in 1999 and was considered a milestone success for the band. The CD was released internationally on Roadrunner Records and marked the band's major label debut. The album's hit single, the title track ''Wasting the Dawn'' lyrically paid tribute to [[The Doors]]' [[Jim Morrison]] and was released as a digipack CD single. Jyrki 69 developed a concept video for this track which featured long-time friend and collaborator [[HIM (Finnish band)|HIM]] member [[Ville Valo]] posing at a snowy cemetery as the ghost of Jim Morrison. This video was released on DVD in Finland with a bonus behind the scenes feature and marked first ever music DVD released in the country.
Both the video and feature were later added as extras on 2003's Helsinki Vampires DVD.

===2000–2002===
In early 2000, the band began working with producer Johnny Lee Michaels in Helsinki who would helm the band's next four albums, and contribute to the fifth.
Spring brought the single ''Gothic Girl'' which spent months on the Singles Top 10 and on Finnish nation radio playlists. It became the band's first gold record. This single was a precursor to the sixth album, released in September 2000, ''Blessed Be'' which rose to number 4 on the Finnish Album Charts and stayed in the top 10 for over a month. The album spawned four singles, the aforementioned ''Gothic Girl'', ''Brandon Lee'', ''The Chair'' and ''Stolen Season''. Videos were filmed for the first three singles. After the release of ''[[Blessed Be]]'', the band did their first short tour in Germany which included a show at the [[M'era Luna Festival]]. Support for the tour was Norwegian rock band [[Zeromancer]].

In 2002 the band released ''[[Paris Kills]]'', which would be known as their breakthrough album. It stayed for weeks as number 1 in Finland and went gold in a month of its release. It has since gone platinum. In Germany it rose to number 35 in the first week. After touring Europe and Finland for months, a sold-out show at Helsinki's famous [[Tavastia Club]] was filmed and documented in November 2002 for use in the "Helsinki Vampires" DVD.

===2003–2007===
At the end of 2003, The 69 Eyes signed to [[EMI]] Finland as they geared up to record ''[[Devils (The 69 Eyes album)|Devils]]''. The "Lost Boys" single was released in Finland at this time, paying homage to the film of the same name as anticipation for the full-length album grew.
2004 saw the release of ''[[Devils (The 69 Eyes album)|Devils]]'', their 8th album, to which they toured the UK in support of [[Wednesday 13 (band)|Wednesday 13]]. Once again the album was a success in their native Finland. It became the band's fourth album to reach gold status and the second to reach number one position on the Finnish TOP 40 album charts. It was Released in Finland in October 2004 and in October 2005 in the U.S. through 456 Entertainment.

In 2005, The 69 Eyes played nearly one hundred shows around the world in fifteen countries, from Mexico to Japan.<ref name="The 69 Eyes † Tour">{{cite web|url=http://www.69eyes.com/angelsite/tour/|title=The 69 Eyes † Tour<!-- Bot generated title -->|access-date=19 September 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117005123/http://www.69eyes.com/angelsite/tour|archive-date=17 January 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> ''[[Devils (The 69 Eyes album)|Devils]]'' was also released in the U.S. with an alternate cover from the international release.

===West End===
On 25 May 2019, The 69 Eyes announced they were to release their twelfth studio album on [[Friday the 13th]] of September 2019 via Nuclear Blast. Jyrki 69 gave a few details about the new record, saying "I feel like this planet is on some turning point. The end of the western world is near and the question is: What is happening when the west ends..? The title has multiple meanings for us… but be assured it has definitely nothing to do with The Pet Shop Boys or London."

"The track deals with the idea of Hollywood and everyone coming there to make their dreams come true, but it's very seldom that they succeed and this is something you can see there everywhere", Jyrki 69 contemplates. "It's a place that makes you desperate and I wanted to get these dark vibes into the song. But on the other hand the track is also a celebration of life – we should be excited to be here and everybody's a legend and they should realise that we should enjoy what we do instead of worry what other people think."<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rawmusictv.com/article/amp/2019/THE-69-EYES-Announce-new-studio-album-West-End-and-EU | title = THE 69 EYES Announce new album 'West End' and EU Tour + new Music Video | date = May 25, 2019 | access-date = May 25, 2019 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>
