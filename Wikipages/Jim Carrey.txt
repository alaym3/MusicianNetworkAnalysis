Touring venues throughout North America as the opening act for Rodney Dangerfield, Carrey made a triumphant return home to Toronto on 19 June 1982, performing two sold-out shows at [[Massey Hall]].

===1983–1994: Move to Hollywood===
In early 1983, Carrey decided to permanently move to Hollywood where he began regularly performing at [[The Comedy Store]]. Getting on ''The Tonight Show'' became his immediate career goal, and, by spring 1983, he appeared to have achieved it after getting booked for a stand-up set on the highly-rated late night show.<ref name="Carrey-sioux">{{cite web |first=Bruce |last=Miller |title=When Carson was king: Comedy careers were made, Jim Carrey says |url=https://siouxcityjournal.com/entertainment/television/when-carson-was-king-comedy-careers-were-made-jim-carrey-says/article_33e9c7fe-62b2-5659-add3-687641f80e06.html |work=[[Sioux City Journal]] |access-date=December 13, 2020 |date=June 2, 2017 }}</ref> However, a lukewarm club set at The Improv got him unbooked.<ref name="Carrey-sioux"/> Though struggling to replicate his success in Los Angeles, Carrey continued being a big hit in his hometown Toronto where he returned during late April 1983 to perform at the short-lived B.B. Magoon's theatrical venue on [[Bloor Street]] on three consecutive nights. While in town, [[CTV Television Network|CTV]]'s flagship newsmagazine program ''[[W5 (TV program)|W5]]'' did a feature on Carrey that aired nationally in Canada. Back in L.A., within months, he landed the main role on ''[[The Duck Factory]]'', a sitcom being developed for NBC, and, in late November 1983, still got to debut his impressionist act on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' via a promotional appearance for the sitcom about to start airing nationally in the United States on the same network.<ref name="Carrey-sioux"/> In the meantime, he was cast for a supporting role in the US$7 million [[Warner Bros.]] comedy production ''[[Finders Keepers (1984 film)|Finders Keepers]]'', shot in the Canadian province of [[Alberta]] during late summer 1983. For his ''Tonight Show'' [[List of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson episodes (1983)#November|appearance]] that aired on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|American Thanksgiving]], 21-year-old Carrey went through his most popular impressions—[[Elvis Presley]], [[Leonid Brezhnev]], [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Bruce Dern]], [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Charles Bronson]], [[Michael Landon]], [[James Dean]], [[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]], [[Charles Nelson Reilly]], characters from ''[[My Three Sons]]'', and [[Kermit the Frog]] & [[Miss Piggy]]—in rapid succession.<ref name="cbsnews">{{cite news |last=Leung |first=Rebecca |title=Carrey: 'Life Is Too Beautiful' |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/carrey-life-is-too-beautiful/ |work=CBS News |access-date=April 26, 2012}}</ref> After completing his set, though getting the [[OK gesture]] from Carson, the impressionist comic was notably not waved over by the host to join him on the couch—a usual indication that while sufficiently pleased, the powerful host was probably not ecstatic about the performance.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rhodes |first=Joe |title=Carson's Code |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/30/arts/television/carsons-code.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=30 January 2005 |access-date=7 January 2021}}</ref> The end of 1983 saw Carrey go back home to Toronto once more for a publicized New Years' Eve performance at the [[Fairmont Royal York|Royal York Hotel]]'s [[Imperial Room]].

Originally scheduled to start airing in January 1984, ''The Duck Factory'' sitcom debut in April, airing Thursdays at 9:30pm between ''[[Cheers]]'' and ''[[Hill Street Blues]]''.<ref>{{cite web |first= John J. |last=O'Connor |title=NBC ADDS MTM'S 'DUCK FACTORY' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/12/arts/nbc-adds-mtm-s-duck-factory.html |work=[[New York Times]] |access-date=December 30, 2020 |date=April 12, 1984 }}</ref><ref>{{IMDb title|0086702|The Duck Factory}}</ref> The same month, Carrey took a job hosting the 1984 [[CASBY Awards|U-Know Awards]] ceremony held in Toronto at the Royal York Hotel's Ballroom.<ref>{{cite news |last=Boon |first=Mike |title=U-Knows Highlights from 1984 |url=https://www.torontomike.com/2011/03/u-knows_highlights_from_1984/ |publisher=TorontoMike.com |date=March 27, 2011 |access-date=December 17, 2020}}</ref> By the time he made his debut appearance on NBC's ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' in late July 1984, the network had already cancelled ''The Duck Factory''; Carrey went back to touring with his impressionist act, including often opening for Rodney Dangerfield.

After being noticed doing stand-up by producer [[Samuel Goldwyn Jr.]] and contacted to audition for a teen horror [[sex comedy]] being developed by [[The Samuel Goldwyn Company]], Carrey landed a starring role in ''[[Once Bitten (1985 film)|Once Bitten]]'' shot in early 1985.<ref name="Carrey-herald">{{cite journal |title= Once Bitten interview: Jim Carrey |journal=[[West Seattle Herald]] |date=November 1985 }}</ref> The young impressionist comic would continue getting film roles; throughout late summer and early fall 1985, he shot a supporting part in [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[Peggy Sue Got Married]]'' which then went into a long post-production process.<ref name="Carrey-herald"/> In parallel, he decided to try out for ''Saturday Night Live'' again, this time ahead of the show's [[Saturday Night Live (season 11)|1985-86 season]] being prepared by returning executive producer [[Lorne Michaels]] who was looking to hire an all-new cast. Five years removed from his previous ''SNL'' audition, twenty-three-year-old Carrey got rejected again, reportedly never even getting the chance to audition his material—'[[Nuclear holocaust|post-nuclear]] Elvis' hybrid impression and impersonation of [[Henry Fonda]] from ''[[On Golden Pond (1981 film)|On Golden Pond]]''—in front of executive producer Michaels due to the show's producers and senior writers [[Al Franken]], [[Tom Davis (comedian)|Tom Davis]], and [[Jim Downey (comedian)|Jim Downey]] deciding that Michaels wouldn't like it.<ref name="Carrey-snl">{{cite news |last=Tabrys |first=Jason |title=The Story Behind Jim Carrey's Many Failed 'SNL' Auditions |url=https://uproxx.com/tv/the-story-behind-jim-carreys-many-failed-saturday-night-live-auditions/ |publisher=[[Uproxx.com]] |date=October 24, 2014 |access-date=January 9, 2020}}</ref> Unlike his previous ''SNL'' rejection, Carrey now had a bit of a movie career to fall back on in addition to his impressionist stand-up act; ''Once Bitten'' was released in mid November 1985 and turned out to be a modest box-office hit despite drawing poor reviews.

Back on the comedy club circuit with impressions, in fall 1986, Carrey auditioned for ''SNL'''s [[Saturday Night Live (season 12)|upcoming season]], his third attempt at getting on the ensemble sketch comedy show. Finally managing to perform for the show's executive producer Lorne Michaels at a [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] studio, with returning cast members [[Dennis Miller]], [[Jon Lovitz]], and [[Nora Dunn]] also watching the audition, Carrey was rejected again.<ref name="Carrey-snl"/> Among the group of hopefuls auditioning alongside Carrey on this occasion were [[Dana Carvey]] and [[Phil Hartman]], both of whom got hired.<ref name="Carrey-snl"/>

Sensing that doing only impressions was turning into a career dead-end, Carrey set out to develop a new live comedy act.<ref name="Carrey-Ebert">{{cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |title=Jim Carrey Laughs in Face of Success |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/jim-carrey-laughs-in-face-of-success |publisher=RogerEbert.com |date=July 24, 1994 |access-date=January 10, 2021}}</ref> Much to the dismay of comedy club owners booking him, he began abandoning trademark spastic celebrity impressions, opting instead to try adding [[Observational comedy|observational]] and [[Character comedy|character]] humour to his comedic repertoire, a process that often involved forcing himself to improvise and scramble in front of dissatisfied live audiences that came to see him do impressions.<ref name="Carrey-Ebert"/>

From 1990 to 1994, Carrey was a regular cast member of the ensemble comedy television series ''[[In Living Color]]''.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.tvovermind.com/tv-news/top-5-jim-carrey-characters-living-color |title=The Top 5 Jim Carrey Characters from in Living Color |date=June 13, 2017 |work=TVOvermind |access-date=January 12, 2018 |archive-date=November 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201117001042/https://www.tvovermind.com/top-5-jim-carrey-characters-living-color/ |url-status=live }}</ref> While short-lived, the popularity of this series helped him to land his first few major film roles.

Carrey portrayed the [[Batman]] villain [[Riddler|The Riddler]] in the [[Joel Schumacher]]-directed [[superhero film]] ''[[Batman Forever]]'' (1995). The film received mixed reviews, but was a box office success. He reprised his role as [[Ace Ventura]] in ''[[Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls]]'' which was also released in 1995. Like the original film, it was well received by the public, but poorly received by critics. It was a huge box-office success, earning $212&nbsp;million worldwide in addition to breaking records, with a $40&nbsp;million opening weekend.<ref name="mojo">{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=aceventura2.htm |title=Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995) |website=Box Office Mojo |date=March 2, 1996 |access-date=May 5, 2012 |archive-date=November 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201117001124/https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl121669121/weekend/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Carrey became the first actor to be paid $20&nbsp;million for his next film, ''[[The Cable Guy]]'' (1996).<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=Spring 2000|issue=540|page=111|title=Big Deals|last=Fierman|first=Daniel}}</ref> Directed by [[Ben Stiller]], the film was a [[satire|satirical]] [[black comedy]], in which Carrey played a lonely, menacing cable TV installer who infiltrates the life of one of his customers (played by [[Matthew Broderick]]). The role was a departure from the "hapless, hyper, overconfident" characters he had been known for. However, it did not fare well with most critics, many reacting to Carrey's change of tone from previous films.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cable_guy |title=The Cable Guy&nbsp;– Movie Reviews, Trailers, Pictures |website=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=March 12, 2012 |archive-date=November 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201117001253/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cable_guy |url-status=live }}</ref> Carrey also starred in the music video of the film's closing song, "[[Leave Me Alone (Jerry Cantrell song)|Leave Me Alone]]" by [[Jerry Cantrell]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQExlqz6slk |title=Jerry Cantrell – Leave Me Alone |via=YouTube |access-date=July 25, 2018 |archive-date=August 28, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180828173157/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQExlqz6slk&gl=US&hl=en |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite the reviews, ''The Cable Guy'' grossed $102&nbsp;million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=cableguy.htm |title=The Cable Guy (1996) |publisher=Boxofficemojo.com |date=August 30, 1996 |access-date=March 12, 2012 |archive-date=November 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201117001114/https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl3276375553/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

He soon bounced back with the critically acclaimed comedy ''[[Liar Liar]]'' (1997), playing Fletcher Reede, an unethical lawyer rendered unable to lie by his young son's birthday wish. Carrey was praised for his performance, earning a second Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor. [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said: "Well into his tumultuous career, Mr. Carrey finally turns up in a straightforward comic vehicle, and the results are much wilder and funnier than this mundane material should have allowed."<ref>{{cite news |first=Janet |last=Maslin |author-link=Janet Maslin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/21/movies/the-truth-shall-set-you-free-not.html |title=The Truth Shall Set You Free.

That same year, Carrey appeared as a fictionalized version of himself on the final episode of [[Garry Shandling]]'s ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'', in which he deliberately ripped into [[Larry Sanders (character)|Shandling's character]].

In 2004, Carrey starred in ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]''. The film received overwhelming acclaim upon release. Critics highly praised Carrey's portrayal of Joel Barish, in addition to the performance of his co-star [[Kate Winslet]], who received an Oscar nomination. According to [[CNN]]'s reviewer [[Paul Clinton]], Carrey's performance was the actor's "best, most mature and sharply focused performance ever."<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/18/review.sunshine/index.html CNN.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6CYTg83s0?url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/18/review.sunshine/index.html |date=November 30, 2012 }} "the best, most mature and sharply focused performance ever from Jim Carrey."</ref> Carrey received another Golden Globe nomination and his first BAFTA Award nomination for [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|Best Actor]].

Carrey's next appearance was in the 2004 black comedy fantasy film ''[[Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'', which was based on the popular children's novels [[A Series of Unfortunate Events|of the same name]]. The film was positively received; [[Desson Thomson]] from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said of Carrey's approach to the character of [[Count Olaf]],<blockquote>Olaf is a humorless villain in the book. He's not amusing like Carrey at all. To which I would counter: If you can't let Carrey be Carrey, put someone boring and less expensive in the role. In his various disguises he's rubbery, inventive and improvisationally inspired. I particularly liked his passing imitation of a dinosaur.<ref>{{cite news |author-link=Desson Thomson |first=Deeson |last=Thomson |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A4634-2004Dec16.html |title=A Fortunate Series of Scenes |date=April 17, 2004 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=April 10, 2009 |archive-date=November 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201117001151/https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A4634-2004Dec16.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lemony_snicket/ |title=Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=April 8, 2009 |archive-date=February 28, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228095729/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lemony_snicket/ |url-status=live }}</ref></blockquote> That same year, Carrey was inducted into the [[Canadian Walk of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Jim Carrey, 2004 inductee |url=http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/inductee/jim-carrey |publisher=Canada's Walk of Fame |access-date=September 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106114251/http://canadaswalkoffame.com/inductee/jim-carrey |archive-date=November 6, 2011}}</ref> In 2005, Carrey starred in the remake of ''[[Fun with Dick and Jane (2005 film)|Fun with Dick and Jane]]'' with [[Tea Leoni]], which grossed $200 million with a profit of $100 million. This film continued his brand of physical humor which propelled him to stardom in the 1990s.

===2007–2018: Change in pace===
Carrey reunited with [[Joel Schumacher]], director of ''[[Batman Forever]]'', for ''[[The Number 23]]'' (2007), a psychological thriller co-starring [[Virginia Madsen]] and [[Danny Huston]]. In the film, Carrey plays a man who becomes obsessed with the [[23 enigma|number 23]], after finding a book about a man with the same obsession. The film was panned by critics. The following year Carrey provided his voice for [[Dr. Seuss]]' ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (film)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'' (2008). Carrey voiced [[Horton the Elephant|the elephant]] for the CGI-animated feature, which was a box office success, grossing over $290&nbsp;million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/horton-hears-a-who2008/ |title=Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who |access-date=April 14, 2008 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |archive-date=November 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201117001127/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/horton-hears-a-who2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Carrey returned to live-action comedy, starring opposite [[Zooey Deschanel]] and [[Bradley Cooper]] in ''[[Yes Man (film)|Yes Man]]'' (also 2008). Carrey played a man who signs up for a self-help program that teaches him to say yes to everything. Despite reviews being mixed, Rene Rodriquez of ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' stated, "''Yes Man'' is fine as far as Jim Carrey comedies go, but it's even better as a love story that just happens to make you laugh."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.miami.com/yes-man-pg-13-article/ |title=Miami Herald ''Yes Man'' Review |work=[[The Miami Herald]] |date=December 19, 2008 |access-date=December 21, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503130332/http://www.miami.com/yes-man-pg-13-article |archive-date=May 3, 2009 }}</ref> The film had a decent performance at the box office, earning $225&nbsp;million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=yesman.htm |title=Yes Man (2008) |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=April 28, 2015 |archive-date=November 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201117001247/https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2860156417/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Since 2009, Carrey's work has included a leading role in [[Glenn Ficarra]] and [[John Requa]]'s ''[[I Love You Phillip Morris]]'', premiering in January 2009 at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] before receiving a wide release in February 2010. Carrey portrayed [[Steven Jay Russell]], a [[con artist]], imposter, and multiple prison escapee who falls in love with his fellow inmate, Phillip Morris (played by [[Ewan McGregor]]). The film received largely positive reviews, with Damon Wise of ''[[The Times]]'' giving the film four stars out of five, stating, "''I Love You Phillip Morris'' is an extraordinary film that serves as a reminder of just how good Carrey can be when he's not tied into a generic Hollywood crowd-pleaser. His comic timing remains as exquisite as ever."<ref>{{cite news |first=Damon |last=Wise |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/film_reviews/article5548068.ece |title=I Love You Phillip Morris at the Sundance Film Festival, Utah |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=January 20, 2009 |access-date=March 19, 2010 |location=London}}</ref>

Directed by [[Robert Zemeckis]], the film also starred [[Robin Wright Penn]], [[Bob Hoskins]], [[Colin Firth]], [[Gary Oldman]], and [[Cary Elwes]]. The film received decent reviews and was a financial success. Carrey landed the lead role in ''[[Mr. Popper's Penguins (film)|Mr. Popper's Penguins]]'' (2011), playing Thomas "Tom" Popper Jr. a realtor who becomes the caretaker of a family of penguins. The film received a mixed reception upon release.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mr_poppers_penguins_2010/ |title=Mr. Popper's Penguins&nbsp;– Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=June 17, 2011 |archive-date=November 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201117001129/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mr_poppers_penguins_2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>

He starred alongside former co-star [[Steve Carell]] in the [[Don Scardino]]-directed comedy film ''[[The Incredible Burt Wonderstone]]'' (2013).

In March 2013, Carrey announced that he had written a children's book titled ''How Roland Rolls'', about a scared wave named Roland.

Carrey released a statement the following day: {{quote|text=What a terrible shame.

In 2009, Carrey wrote an article [[Vaccine hesitancy|questioning the merits of vaccination]] for ''[[The Huffington Post]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-carrey/the-judgment-on-vaccines_b_189777.html |title=Jim Carrey: The Judgment on Vaccines Is In??? |work=HuffPost |access-date=February 7, 2011 |archive-date=November 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201117001208/https://www.huffpost.com/static/editors-note-vaccine |url-status=live }}</ref> With former partner [[Jenny McCarthy]], Carrey led a "Green Our Vaccines" march in Washington, D.C., to advocate for the removal of "toxic substances" from children's vaccines, out of a belief that children had received "too many vaccines, too soon, many of which are toxic".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/OnCall/story?id=4987758 |work=ABC News |title=Celeb Couple to Lead 'Green Vaccine' Rally |first1=Jonann |last1=Brady |first2=Stephanie |last2=Dahle |date=June 4, 2008 |access-date=March 16, 2011 |archive-date=December 7, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181207162725/https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/OnCall/story?id=4987758 |url-status=live }}</ref> The rally was criticized by [[David Gorski]], an American [[surgical oncologist]] on ''[[Science-Based Medicine]]'' blog, for being anti-vaccine and not "pro-safe vaccine",<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/jenny-mccarthy-jim-carrey-and-green-our-vaccines-anti-vaccine-not-pro-safe-vaccine/ |title=Jenny McCarthy, Jim Carrey, and "Green Our Vaccines": Anti-vaccine, not "pro-safe vaccine" |work=Science Based Medicine |access-date=July 3, 2015}}</ref> and by Steven Parker on the [[WebMD]] website for being "irresponsible".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blogs.webmd.com/healthy-children/2008/06/green-our-vaccines.html |title=Green Our Vaccines? |work=WebMD |access-date=July 3, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705214043/http://blogs.webmd.com/healthy-children/2008/06/green-our-vaccines.html |archive-date=July 5, 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

On July 1, 2015, after the signing of a [[California Senate Bill 277|new vaccination law]], Carrey called [[California Governor]] [[Jerry Brown]] a "corporate fascist" who was "poisoning" children by enacting the vaccination requirements.<ref name=fascist>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-actor-jim-carrey-vaccines-20150701-story.html |title=Jim Carrey calls Gov.

=== Political and spiritual views ===
Carrey believes in and advocates for the so-called "[[Law of attraction (New Thought)|law of attraction]]". In an interview with [[Oprah Winfrey]] on 17 February 1997,<ref>{{youtube|nPU5bjzLZX0|What Oprah Learned from Jim Carrey – Oprah's Lifeclass – Oprah Winfrey Network}}</ref> he revealed that as a struggling actor he would use [[Creative visualization|visualization]] techniques to get work.
