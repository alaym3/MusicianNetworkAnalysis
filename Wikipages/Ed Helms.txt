Helms was performing comedy in [[New York City]] when, as he recalled in a 2005 interview, "''[[The Daily Show]]'' had a sort of open audition with a casting company that I had dealt with. I read for the part, and got it".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecomical.com/features/ed_helms_interview.html |work=TheComical.com |title=Ed Helms on Politics, The Media and The Daily Show |date=2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724070121/http://www.thecomical.com/features/ed_helms_interview.html |archive-date=July 24, 2008 }}</ref> In his April 2002 to mid-2006 tenure on the satirical news program, Helms contributed "field reports" in addition to hosting various segments of the show, such as "[[The Daily Show recurring elements#Digital Watch|Digital Watch]]", "[[The Daily Show recurring elements#Ad Nauseam|Ad Nauseam]]", and "[[The Daily Show recurring elements#Mark Your Calendar|Mark Your Calendar]]".

His 2005 segment "Battle of the Bulge", which focused on the wearing of Speedo bathing suits on the beaches of [[Cape May, New Jersey]], and his "Mass.
