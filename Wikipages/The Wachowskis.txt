After its success, the Wachowskis directed two sequels [[Back to back film production|back-to-back]], ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' and ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'', both released in 2003.

During production of the first film, the Wachowskis and Spencer Lamm, who ran the film's official website, developed comics based on the setting of the film, which were published free of charge on the website. These and a few short stories were released in three series from 1999 to 2003, with several of them (along with new material) collected in two print volumes in 2003 and 2004. The Wachowskis themselves contributed "Bits and Pieces", a prequel to the movie that explains the origins of the Matrix, featuring illustrations by [[Geof Darrow]], the movie's conceptual designer. Other writers and artists that contributed to the series include [[Neil Gaiman]], [[Dave Gibbons]], [[Paul Chadwick]], [[Ted McKeever]], [[Poppy Z. Brite]], and [[Steve Skroce]].

After Lilly Wachowski came out as transgender, she encouraged looking back on her and Lana's works "through the lens of our transness", saying that the themes of identity, self-image and transformation are apparent in ''The Matrix''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.themarysue.com/the-matrix-trans-lens/|title=Lilly Wachowski Acknowledges Re-Examination of The Matrix With Lens Focused on Transness|website=themarysue.com |date=April 5, 2016|access-date=October 30, 2018}}</ref>

=== Later collaborations ===
The Wachowskis' next feature film was ''[[V for Vendetta (film)|V for Vendetta]]'', an adaptation of [[Alan Moore]] & [[David Lloyd (comics)|David Lloyd]]'s graphic novel [[V for Vendetta|of the same name]], starring [[Natalie Portman]] and [[Hugo Weaving]]. They wrote and produced the film with ''Matrix'' producer [[Joel Silver]], who had previously purchased the film rights to the graphic novel. The Wachowskis offered the film to [[James McTeigue]], the first assistant director of ''The Matrix'' trilogy, as his directorial debut. Moore did not participate in the production, as he was disappointed by previous Hollywood adaptations of his work, and disagreed with differences between his graphic novel and the screenplay. Following a statement to the press by Silver that Moore was supposedly excited to learn more about the movie, Moore demanded that Silver retract it, and had his own name removed from the credits when he didn't.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/movies/the-vendetta-behind-v-for-vendetta.html|title=The Vendetta Behind 'V for Vendetta'|first=Dave|last=Itzkoff|date=March 12, 2006|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 15, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419010342/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/movies/the-vendetta-behind-v-for-vendetta.html|archive-date=April 19, 2017}}</ref> The film's controversial storyline and themes have been both criticized and praised by sociopolitical groups.

In 2006, Silver had the Wachowskis and McTeigue hired to revamp ''[[The Invasion (film)|The Invasion]]'' for Warner Bros. The studio was disappointed in the film as produced by director [[Oliver Hirschbiegel]] and hired the Wachowskis to rewrite a portion of the script and add new action scenes, which McTeigue directed. The film, the fourth adaptation of the novel ''[[The Body Snatchers]]'', was released in 2007 and was not a critical or box office success.

The Wachowskis returned to directing with ''[[Speed Racer (film)|Speed Racer]]'' (2008) which starred [[Emile Hirsch]]. The film, which was again produced by Silver, was an adaptation of a [[Speed Racer#Manga|1960s Japanese manga series]] originally called ''Mach GoGoGo'', which had previously been adapted as an [[Speed Racer#Anime|anime television series]] in 1967. The Wachowskis were attracted to the project because the series was the first anime they had watched, and they wanted to make a family-friendly film for their nieces and nephews to enjoy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Film-Review/speed-racer-joel-silver-interview|title=IndieLondon: Speed Racer – Joel Silver interview – Your London Reviews |last=www.t75.org |publisher=indielondon.co.uk|access-date=September 14, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915005552/http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Film-Review/speed-racer-joel-silver-interview|archive-date=September 15, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/03/04/wondercon-07-wonder-woman-speed-racer-status|title=WonderCon 07: Wonder Woman, Speed Racer Status|first=Eric|last=Moro|date=March 3, 2007|publisher=ign.com|access-date=September 14, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131107224721/http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/03/04/wondercon-07-wonder-woman-speed-racer-status|archive-date=November 7, 2013}}</ref> In an effort to simulate the look of anime in live action, the Wachowskis had cinematographer [[David Tattersall]] shoot the movie [[Digital cinematography|digitally]] on a [[digital backlot]] with the intention of adding extensive visual effects in post-production.

Michael Straczynski]], who has worked with the Wachowskis on ''Ninja Assassin'' and ''Sense8'', has said that the sisters told him they were reading his column on scriptwriting for the ''[[Writer's Digest]]'' magazine, for inspiration and pointers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awardsdaily.com/tv/interview-sense8-straczynski/|title=Straczynski Talks 'Sense8' and the Outrageous Show's Diversity|date=June 9, 2016|publisher=awardsdaily.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610215350/http://www.awardsdaily.com/tv/interview-sense8-straczynski/|archive-date=June 10, 2016|access-date=October 31, 2016}}</ref> Straczynski contributed to the magazine from 1981 to 1991.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu/pipermail/b5jms/1996-April/000390.html|title=J.

In 1998, in the context of explaining how they got their start in filmmaking, the Wachowskis mentioned [[Roger Corman]]'s book ''How I Made A Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a Dime'', and indicated, with laughter, that they liked his movies, and began by wanting to "make a low-budget horror movie".<ref name="gadflyonline1" /> In the same interview they stated that they felt flattered, after their first film, by comparisons others had made between them and the [[Coen brothers]], who had "made five, maybe six great movies…" at that time.<ref name="gadflyonline1" />

Speaking to Bernard Weintraub of ''[[The New York Times]]'' in April 1999, the Wachowskis mentioned explicitly that they prepared for their first ''Matrix'' production by studying the works of [[John Woo]] "and other Hong Kong filmmakers", as well as reading and rereading Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', and studying the works of [[John Huston]], [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[Fritz Lang]], [[George Lucas]], [[Ridley Scott]], and [[Billy Wilder]].<ref name="nytimes">{{cite news |last=Weinraub |first=Bernard |title=Brothers Unleash the Comic Book of Ideas |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/05/movies/brothers-unleash-the-comic-book-of-ideas.html |url-status=live |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 5, 1999 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307045432/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/05/movies/brothers-unleash-the-comic-book-of-ideas.html |archive-date=March 7, 2016 |access-date=September 28, 2016 }}</ref>

Mark Miller, writing in ''Wired'' in 2003, also listed [[Homer]], [[Hermann Hesse]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], and philosopher [[Cornel West]].<ref name="wired" /> In an interview with ''[[Gadfly Online|Gadfly]]'' in 1998 (after their first movie), the Wachowskis reiterated their influence by or enjoyment of Huston (e.g. ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'') and Wilder (e.g., ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' and ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|Lost Weekend]]''), and added to these the impacts of [[Alfred Hitchcock]] (e.g. ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' and ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''), [[Roman Polanski]] (e.g. ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]''), and [[Francis Ford Coppola]] (the [[The Godfather (film series)|''Godfather'' movies]], and ''[[The Conversation]]'').<ref name="gadflyonline1" />

[[Ken Wilber]] has been cited as an influence.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/5184723|title=Anti Hero – the Hidden Revolution in Leadership & Change|journal=Academia.edu|page=60|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104035602/http://www.academia.edu/5184723/Anti_Hero_-_the_Hidden_Revolution_in_Leadership_and_Change|archive-date=November 4, 2016|access-date=October 1, 2016|last1=Mezey|first1=Matthew}}</ref>

The Wachowskis admit to a love for telling multi-part stories. "Because we grew up on comic books and the [[J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] [[The Lord of the Rings|trilogy]], one of the things we're interested in is bringing serial fiction to cinema," Lana has said. Lilly says: "We think movies are fairly boring and predictable. We want to screw with audiences' expectations."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmbug.com/db/341821 |title=Larry Wachowski |publisher=Filmbug |date=February 25, 2005 |access-date=July 19, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706125122/http://www.filmbug.com/db/341821 |archive-date=July 6, 2012 }}</ref> In terms of themes expressed in their body of work, Lana has cited "the inexplicable nature of the universe [being] in constant dialogue with our own consciousness and our consciousness actually affect[ing] the inexplicable nature of the universe",<ref name="ukscreen" /> "interconnectivity and about truth beneath the surface",<ref>McGrath, Charles (October 9, 2012) [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/movies/cloud-atlas-as-rendered-by-tom-tykwer-and-the-wachowskis.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1& "Bending Time, Bending Minds"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404035956/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/movies/cloud-atlas-as-rendered-by-tom-tykwer-and-the-wachowskis.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1& |date=April 4, 2015}}, ''The New York Times''.</ref> "the paradox of choice and choicelessness",<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia_mZ7IjBQM Lana and Andy Wachowski New Matrix, Jupiter Ascending, Sign Vendetta Mask @ Cloud Atlas Gala London] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503021729/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia_mZ7IjBQM |date=May 3, 2017}}.

The Wachowskis cited the art of comic book artist [[Geof Darrow]] as an influence on the look of ''The Matrix''. Also, they said that ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'', ''[[Ninja Scroll]]'', and ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' were anime that inspired them, saying "in anime, one thing that they do that we tried to bring to our film was a juxtaposition of time and space in action beats".

The Wachowskis cited [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' as a major influence for ''Cloud Atlas''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Corliss |first=Richard |date=October 25, 2012 |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/10/25/cloud-atlas-the-wachowskis-struggle-in-the-stratosphere/ |title='Cloud Atlas' Movie Review: The Wachowskis Struggle in the Stratosphere |work=Time |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111065512/http://entertainment.time.com/2012/10/25/cloud-atlas-the-wachowskis-struggle-in-the-stratosphere/ |archive-date=January 11, 2013 }}</ref> They first saw the film when they were ten and seven, respectively.<ref name="NewYorker" />

Lana has most been influenced by ''2001: A Space Odyssey'', ''[[Blade Runner]]'', ''[[Ma vie en rose]]'', and ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]''.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jeff |last=Oloizia |url=https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/sam-taylor-johnson-lisa-cholodenko-sarah-polley-and-other-female-directors-on-the-movies-that-influenced-them/#Wachowski |title=Sam Taylor-Johnson, Lisa Cholodenko, Sarah Polley and Other Female Directors on the Movies That Influenced Them |work=T Magazine |date=August 13, 2014 |access-date=August 18, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820135216/http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/sam-taylor-johnson-lisa-cholodenko-sarah-polley-and-other-female-directors-on-the-movies-that-influenced-them/#Wachowski |archive-date=August 20, 2014  }}</ref> Both Wachowskis are fans of the ''Ghost in the Shell'', ''Akira'', ''[[Wicked City (1987 film)|Wicked City]]'', ''Ninja Scroll'' and ''[[Fist of the North Star (1986 film)|Fist of the North Star]]'' [[anime]] films.<ref>''Manga Max'' No. 8, July 1999</ref>

None of the [[home video]] releases of their films feature any [[deleted scene]]s. Lana says that despite often having to cut scenes from their movies, they do not want to include deleted scenes in such releases, as this would suggest that their films suffer from incompleteness. They love their finished products and believe them complete.<ref name="webchat">{{cite web |url=http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/cmp/larryandychat.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213041503/http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/cmp/larryandychat.html |archive-date=February 13, 2010 |title=Chat with the Wachowski Brothers |publisher=whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com |date=November 6, 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Weintraub |date=October 27, 2012 |url=https://collider.com/andy-wachowski-lana-wachowski-cloud-atlas-speed-racer-interview/ |title=Andy Wachowski, Lana Wachowski, and Tom Tykwer Talk CLOUD ATLAS and SPEED RACER |work=Collider |access-date=October 8, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012111816/http://collider.com/andy-wachowski-lana-wachowski-cloud-atlas-speed-racer-interview/ |archive-date=October 12, 2014 }}</ref> For the same reason, they have not released their films for home video with [[Director's cut|director's]] or [[extended cut]]s. They also avoid recording [[audio commentary]] tracks, having participated only on the track recorded for the [[LaserDisc]] of ''Bound''. The sisters say they learned that offering an interpretation of their films means that viewers will be less likely to express their own interpretation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.matrixfans.net/symbolism-philosophy-and-allegory/the-many-meanings-of-the-matrix/ |title=The Many Meanings of the Matrix |publisher=MatrixFans.net |access-date=October 8, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013220100/http://www.matrixfans.net/symbolism-philosophy-and-allegory/the-many-meanings-of-the-matrix/ |archive-date=October 13, 2014 }}</ref><ref>Introduction by the Wachowski Brothers included in ''The Ultimate Matrix Collection''</ref>

The Wachowskis frequently hire the same basic [[film crew]] to make their movies. Lana says they do it in part to ensure a positive environment. "It's like family. Everyone is very respectful of each other," says Lana.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tabach-Bank|first=Lauren|url=https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/female-directors-hollywood-sam-taylor-johnson-jennifer-yuh-nelson-ava-duvernay-sarah-polley-lisa-cholodenko/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=1|title=Flipping the Script|work=The New York Times|date=August 13, 2014}}</ref> They used the same practice while selecting the [[television crew]] for their [[Netflix]] show, ''[[Sense8]]''.

=== Lana's gender transition ===
Rumors that Lana Wachowski was [[transitioning (transgender)|transitioning]] spread in the early 2000s, though neither sibling spoke directly on the subject at the time.<ref name="Guardian" /> In 2003, ''[[Gothamist]]'' reported the possible transition.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jen |last=Chung |url=http://gothamist.com/2003/06/05/sex_change_for_larry_wachowski.php |title=Sex Change for Larry Wachowski? |publisher=gothamist.com |date=June 5, 2003 |access-date=August 19, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324071241/http://gothamist.com/2003/06/05/sex_change_for_larry_wachowski.php |archive-date=March 24, 2012 }}</ref> In a 2007 interview, [[Joel Silver]], the producer of numerous Wachowski films, said that the rumors concerning the transition were "all untrue", saying that "they just don't do interviews, so people make things up." Crew members working on ''Speed Racer'' said similar things.<ref>{{cite news |first=Roger |last=Friedman |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,295909,00.html |title=No Sex Change for 'Matrix' Director Larry Wachowski |publisher=Fox News |date=September 6, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915193450/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,295909,00.html |archive-date=September 15, 2008  |access-date=February 28, 2013}}</ref>

Her acceptance speech was one of the longest public appearances by either of the reclusive sisters. Lana said that, although she and Lilly had not publicly commented on her transitioning during the previous decade, it was not because she was ashamed of it, nor had she kept it a secret from her family and friends. Rather, she stated, the two are generally shy about the news media and prefer to maintain their privacy. Comparing media exposure to losing one's virginity as an irreversible event that only happens once, the Wachowskis had tried to stay out of the public eye. They feared losing their privacy and the ability to go to public places without being noticed and harassed as celebrities.

Explaining her decision to appear at the HRC event, Lana said: <blockquote>
There are some things we do for ourselves, but there are some things we do for others. I am here because when I was young, I wanted very badly to be a writer, I wanted to be a filmmaker, but I couldn't find anyone like me in the world and it felt like my dreams were foreclosed simply because my gender was less typical than others. If I can be that person for someone else, then the sacrifice of my private civic life may have value.<ref name="HRC award speech transcript">{{cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lana-wachowskis-hrc-visibility-award-382177 |title=Lana Wachowski's HRC Visibility Award Acceptance Speech (Transcript) |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=October 24, 2012 |access-date=October 30, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026232657/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lana-wachowskis-hrc-visibility-award-382177 |archive-date=October 26, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}</ref></blockquote>

=== Lilly's gender transition ===
In March 2016, Lilly Wachowski also came out as a transgender woman, issuing a statement to the ''Windy City Times'' after a visit from a reporter from the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' newspaper who had attempted to get an interview with her about it.<ref name=hr20160308 /><ref name="var20160308" /><ref name="glaad20160308" /><ref name=windycitytimes>{{cite news| url =http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/Second-Wachowski-filmmaker-sibling-comes-out-as-trans-/54509.html|title= Second Wachowski filmmaker sibling comes out as trans |first=Tracy |last=Baim| work=[[Windy City Times]]| date=March 8, 2016|access-date=March 9, 2016| archive-date= March 9, 2016| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160309093348/http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/Second-Wachowski-filmmaker-sibling-comes-out-as-trans-/54509.html |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Davies |first1=Caroline |last2=Sweney |first2=Mark |title=Film director Lilly Wachowski comes out as transgender woman |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/09/matrix-director-lilly-wachowski-comes-out-as-a-transgender-woman |website=The Guardian |date=March 9, 2016 |access-date=October 27, 2018}}</ref> In that article, she said, "I am one of the lucky ones.

Lana and Lilly are self-proclaimed [[gamer]]s.

Asked about their feelings about turning the tightly controlled ''Matrix'' saga to the unpredictable form of an [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMORPG]] with ''[[The Matrix Online]]'', the duo appeared enthusiastic about the nature and possibilities of video games:
{{quote|The "vagaries of an MMO where unpredictable player behavior is the rule," is the reason for doing it. Our films were never intended for a passive audience. There are enough of those kinds of films being made. We wanted our audience to have to work, to have to think, to have to actually participate to enjoy them. This may be because while we enjoy movies, we also spend a lot of time (as in crack-den amounts of time) gaming.

Gaming engages your mind actively whereas most genre films (the films we tend to watch) are designed to provoke as little thinking as possible. Consider why the films in which everyone knows exactly what is going to happen are the films that make the most money.

Yet the fact that ''The Matrix'' films are three of the most successful adult films in history (despite of what much of the media would have us believe), suggests that there are other people like us. Those are the people, the people who thought about it, who worked at it, who we ultimately made the trilogy for and it now makes perfect sense to us that they should inherit the storyline. For us, the idea of watching our baby evolve inside the virtual bubble-world of this new radically developing medium, which has in our opinion the potential of combining the best attributes of films and games, of synthesizing reality TV with soap opera, RPGs and [''Mortal Kombat''], is fantastically exciting.|The Wachowskis<ref name="IGN" />}}
