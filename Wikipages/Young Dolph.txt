== Death ==
On November 17, 2021, at 12:22 pm, Thornton was fatally shot in Memphis while picking up cookies for his mother at Makeda's Homemade Butter Cookies, a bakery he frequently visited whenever he was back home. Two unidentified gunmen alighted from a white two-door Mercedes-Benz and gunned him down. Thornton was recorded mere moments before via a fan's smartphone at a Marathon gas station located just a few miles from where he was ultimately shot.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tmz.com/2021/11/18/young-dolph-moments-before-shooting-filling-up-gas-station/|title=Young Dolph Moments Before Shooting, Filling up at Gas Station|access-date=November 21, 2021|archive-date=November 20, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211120124505/https://www.tmz.com/2021/11/18/young-dolph-moments-before-shooting-filling-up-gas-station/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":6">{{cite web|date=November 18, 2021|title=Rapper Young Dolph shot and killed in Memphis, police say|url=https://www.fox13memphis.com/news/local/rapper-young-dolph-shot-killed-memphis-law-enforcement-sources-oconfirm/Y37EQYI6TJBHHMLLBAR6KSMPNA/|url-status=live|access-date=November 18, 2021|website=[[WHBQ-TV]] |archive-date=November 17, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211117225411/https://www.fox13memphis.com/news/local/rapper-young-dolph-shot-killed-memphis-law-enforcement-sources-confirm/Y37EQYI6TJBHHMLLBAR6KSMPNA/}}</ref><ref name=":7">{{cite web|date=November 17, 2021|title=Young Dolph Showed Love To Cookie Place He Was Killed At 1 Week Ago|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/young-dolph-showed-love-to-cookie-place-he-was-killed-at-1-week-ago-news.143124.html|access-date=November 18, 2021|website=HotNewHipHop |archive-date=November 18, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211118195729/https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/young-dolph-showed-love-to-cookie-place-he-was-killed-at-1-week-ago-news.143124.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Crowds of hundreds of people swarmed the scene of Thornton's death for hours; police had to prevent individuals from entering the area while they investigated.<ref name=":6" /> [[Tennessee House of Representatives|Tennessee House Representative]] [[London Lamar]] and Memphis councilman J.
