'''Vitamin String Quartet''' ('''VSQ''') is an American musical group from Los Angeles, widely known for its series of [[tribute album]]s to [[Rock music|rock]] and [[pop music|pop]] acts. 

VSQ is not a [[string quartet]] in the traditional sense. Rather, VSQ is a series of string quartet projects developed and produced by CMH Label Group, an independent record company based in Los Angeles. The CMH team works with an ever-evolving cast of arrangers, producers, string players and other creatives to bring each project to life. Their albums are released through [[Vitamin Records]] and primarily performed by a string quartet, though other instruments have been used. "Vitamin String Quartet is about applying rock n' roll attitude to classical technique," said Tom Tally,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vitaminstringquartet.com/about.html |title=VSQ Biography |author=Vitamin String Quartet |year=2009 |work=Vitamin String Quartet |publisher=Vitamin String Quartet |access-date=March 22, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220020025/http://vitaminstringquartet.com/about.html |archive-date=February 20, 2010 }}</ref> a violist and arranger who has performed on and produced over 50 Vitamin String Quartet albums.
