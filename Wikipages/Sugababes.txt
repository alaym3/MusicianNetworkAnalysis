'''Sugababes''' are a British [[girl group]] composed of [[Keisha Buchanan]], [[Mutya Buena]] and [[Siobhán Donaghy]]. The lineup changed several times before returning to the original lineup in 2019.

Formed in 1998 by [[All Saints (group)|All Saints]] manager Ron Tom, Sugababes released their debut album ''[[One Touch (Sugababes album)|One Touch]]'' through [[London Records]] in November 2000, which achieved moderate success and produced the top-ten single "[[Overload (Sugababes song)|Overload]]". In 2001, Donaghy departed the group and was replaced by [[Heidi Range]]. With Range's introduction, the group experienced a higher level of commercial success and went on to release three [[Music recording certification|multi-platinum]] albums: ''[[Angels with Dirty Faces (Sugababes album)|Angels with Dirty Faces]]'' (2002), ''[[Three (Sugababes album)|Three]]'' (2003) and ''[[Taller in More Ways]]'' (2005). In December 2005, Buena left the group and was replaced by [[Amelle Berrabah]]. Following the release of their [[Overloaded: The Singles Collection|first greatest hits album]], the new line-up released two further studio albums: ''[[Change (Sugababes album)|Change]]'' (2007) and ''[[Catfights and Spotlights]]'' (2008).

In September 2009, after 11 years in Sugababes, Buchanan, the final original member, was replaced by [[Jade Ewen]]. Range, Berrabah and Ewen released the group's seventh studio album, ''[[Sweet 7]]'' (2010), after which they signed to [[RCA Records]], before taking an indefinite hiatus in 2011. That year, the original lineup reformed as '''Mutya Keisha Siobhan''' and released the single "[[Flatline (Mutya Keisha Siobhan song)|Flatline]]". The trio regained the name Sugababes in 2019, and recorded a rendition of the song "[[Flowers (Sweet Female Attitude song)|Flowers]]" with [[DJ Spoony]]. In 2021, for the 20th anniversary of ''One Touch'', Sugababes released a reworking of their 2001 single featuring [[MNEK]], with plans for new music.

Sugababes have achieved six number-one singles: "[[Freak like Me#Sugababes version|Freak like Me]]", "[[Round Round]]", "[[Hole in the Head]]", "[[Push the Button (Sugababes song)|Push the Button]]", "[[Walk This Way]]" and "[[About You Now]]"; the [[Spice Girls]] are the only British girl group to have had more. They have also released five UK top ten albums, four of which were certified Platinum in the UK, and have been nominated for six [[Brit Awards]], winning for [[Brit Award for British Dance Act|Best British Dance Act]] in 2003. They have been a long-term fixture in the British tabloids due to their several line-up changes and alleged group infighting.

===2002–2004: Growing commercial success with ''Angels with Dirty Faces'' and ''Three''===
Having already started work on a second album with new member Range, the trio looked for a new record label, eventually signing to [[Island Records]]. Their first single on the new label, "[[Freak like Me]]" scored the group their first UK number 1 single. Follow-up single "[[Round Round]]" also debuted on top of the [[UK Singles Chart]] and peaked at number 2 in Ireland, the Netherlands and New Zealand. Both singles were certified silver by the [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]].<ref name=BPI-platinum>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/certified-awards.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124005813/http://www.bpi.co.uk/certified-awards.aspx|url-status=dead|title=Certified Awards<!-- Bot generated title -->|archive-date=24 January 2013|access-date=23 October 2021}}</ref> On the back of the success of the singles, the group's second album, ''[[Angels with Dirty Faces (Sugababes album)|Angels with Dirty Faces]]'', debuted at number 2 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and was later certified triple Platinum, selling almost a million copies in the UK alone.<ref name=MW-Nov2008/><ref name=BPI-platinum/> It is to date their highest-selling album.<ref name="fourteen">{{cite web| publisher=ifpi.org| title=Platinum Europe Awards 2003| url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/plat_month_20030311a.html| access-date=17 December 2006| url-status=live| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315100433/http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/plat_month_20030311a.html| archive-date=15 March 2012| df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the UK, the third single from the album, a ballad titled "[[Stronger (Sugababes song)|Stronger]]", gained the girls their third consecutive top ten hit in their native country. The track was released as a double-A side with "[[Angels with Dirty Faces (Sugababes song)|Angels with Dirty Faces]]" in the UK, the latter song chosen as the theme tune to ''[[The Powerpuff Girls Movie]]''. A fourth single, the [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]-sampling "[[Shape (song)|Shape]]", made the top ten in the Netherlands and Ireland in early 2003.

The group's third album, ''[[Three (Sugababes album)|Three]]'', was released in late 2003 and reached number 3 on the UK Albums Chart, earning the group a BRIT Award nomination for Best Album.
