Her family on her mother's side is Spanish and fled Nationalist Spain to go to [[Marseillette]], in the village's concert hall (subject of her second album).<ref>Olivia Ruiz et Anthony Blanc, émission d'Europe 1 C’est de famille, 16 août 2011</ref> She has a brother, Anthony, born in 1985.

At the age of 15, Ruiz started getting involved in music. She left her parents' house to live with her aunt in Narbonne, where she took theater and dance classes with her friends from [[Comigne]], the band Rock Five.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mfmradio.fr/|title=MFM}}</ref> Together, they did some opening acts in order to make some money by singing [[the Cranberries]]’ or [[Lenny Kravitz]]'s songs.  She also took dance classes at the Pelizzon School in Carcassonne and [[Trèbes]]. She entered the Médiévales de Carcassonne, a group of small artists, for their summer show. She started performing in different bars, along with Frank Marty (from the bands THC, Les Croquants and La Varda) a multi-instrumentalist from Narbonne. They mainly performed songs from old artists like [[Fréhel]], [[Yves Montand]] and [[Gilbert Bécaud]], but also songs from the new generation and Spanish standards.

In 2001, she was a prominent contestant in the first French edition of ''[[Star Academy (France)|Star Academy]]'', a popular TV reality show and musical contest. She was defeated in the semi-final by eventual winner [[Jenifer Bartoli]] but according to an interview on Europe 1 she claimed that she never wanted to win<ref>"Regarde Les Hommes Changer", Europe 1 13 September 2009</ref> and, following a post-series tour, worked to distance herself from the Star Ac image.
