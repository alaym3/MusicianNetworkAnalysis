'''Rush''' was a Canadian [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Toronto]] in 1968 by [[Alex Lifeson]] (guitars, composer), [[John Rutsey]] (drums, percussion, lyricist), and [[Jeff Jones (musician)|Jeff Jones]], who was immediately replaced by [[Geddy Lee]] (bass, vocals, keyboards, composer). After its formation the band went through several lineup configurations before arriving at its classic [[power trio]] lineup with the addition of [[Neil Peart]] in July 1974, who replaced Rutsey four months after the release of their [[Rush (Rush album)|self-titled debut album]]. This lineup remained intact for the remainder of the band's career.

Rush achieved commercial success in the 1970s with several albums, including ''[[Fly by Night (album)|Fly by Night]]'', (1975), ''[[2112 (album)|2112]]'' (1976), ''[[A Farewell to Kings]]'' (1977) and ''[[Hemispheres (Rush album)|Hemispheres]]'' (1978). The band's rise in popularity continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s, with some albums charting highly in both Canada and the US, including ''[[Permanent Waves]]'' (1980), ''[[Moving Pictures (Rush album)|Moving Pictures]]'' (1981), ''[[Signals (Rush album)|Signals]]'' (1982) and ''[[Counterparts (album)|Counterparts]]'' (1993). Rush continued to record and perform until 1997, after which the band entered a four-year hiatus due to personal tragedies in Peart's life. The trio regrouped in 2001 and released three more studio albums: ''[[Vapor Trails]]'' (2002), ''[[Snakes & Arrows]]'' (2007), and ''[[Clockwork Angels]]'' (2012). Rush ceased large-scale touring at the end of 2015, and Lifeson announced in January 2018 that the band would not continue.<ref name="blabbermouth.net">{{Cite news |date=January 19, 2018 |title=RUSH Guitarist ALEX LIFESON: "We Have No Plans To Tour Or Record Anymore.

Rush is known for its musicianship, complex compositions, and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction, [[fantasy]] and philosophy. The band's style changed over the years, from a blues-inspired [[hard rock]] beginning, later moving into [[progressive rock]], then a period marked by heavy use of synthesizers, before returning to guitar-driven hard rock since the end of the 1980s. The members of Rush have been acknowledged as some of the most proficient players on their respective instruments, with each winning numerous awards in magazine readers' polls.

Rush ranks 88th in the U.S. with sales of 25 million albums<ref>{{Cite web |title=RIAA – Top Selling Artists |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=top-selling-artists |access-date=August 10, 2019 |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] |archive-date=December 9, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209120422/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=top-selling-artists |url-status=live}}</ref> and industry sources estimate their total worldwide album sales at over 40 million as of 2005.

==History==
===1968–1974: Early years and debut album===
[[File:Alex Lifeson3.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Alex Lifeson, co-founder of Rush]]

The band was formed in the neighbourhood of [[Willowdale, Toronto|Willowdale]] in Toronto, Ontario, by guitarist [[Alex Lifeson]], bassist and frontman [[Jeff Jones (musician)|Jeff Jones]], and drummer [[John Rutsey]], in August 1968.<ref name="RV88">{{Cite web |last=Banasiewicz |first=Bill |title=Rush – Visions: The Official Biography – Chapter 1 |url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19880404banasiewiczvisions.htm |access-date=March 10, 2007 |archive-date=February 11, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211210145/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19880404banasiewiczvisions.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> Lifeson and Rutsey had been friends since a young age and played together in The Projection, a short lived band that broke up earlier in the year. The two stuck together and brought in Jones to form a new group; their first gig was in September at the Coff-Inn, a youth centre in the basement of St. Theodore of Canterbury Anglican Church in nearby [[North York, Toronto|North York]]. They were paid CA$25.<ref name=RV88/><ref name="PROG13">{{Cite web |last=Elliot |first=Paul |date=April 2013 |title=PROG: Rush Limited Edition – Men at Work |url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/20130400prog.htm |access-date=December 27, 2018 |website=Prog |issue=35 |archive-date=December 28, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181228035100/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/20130400prog.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> They had not named themselves at the time of the booking; Rutsey's brother Bill thought they needed a name that was short and to the point. He suggested Rush, and the group went with it.<ref name="LS16">{{Cite web |last=Elliott |first=Paul |date=February 3, 2016 |title=The History of Rush by Geddy Lee & Alex Lifeson: The Early Years |url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2016-02-03/rush-s-early-years-exclusive-interview-with-geddy-lee-alex-lifeson |access-date=February 6, 2017 |publisher=Loudersound |archive-date=January 25, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170125175241/http://teamrock.com/feature/2016-02-03/rush-s-early-years-exclusive-interview-with-geddy-lee-alex-lifeson |url-status=live}}</ref> When Jones chose to attend a party hours before their second gig, Lifeson got his schoolmate Gary "Geddy" Weinrib to step in on lead vocals and bass. Jones did not return, so Weinrib became their frontman, adopting the stage name [[Geddy Lee]]. Rush rehearsed a set mainly formed of covers by various rock artists, including [[Cream_(band)|Cream]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], and [[John Mayall]] and underwent several lineup configurations that included Lindy Young on keyboards and various instruments, Joe Perna on bass and vocals, and Mitchel Bossi on second guitar.<ref name=RV88/> For a brief time, Lee was kicked out of the band after Rutsey wished to recruit a new bassist; Lifeson complied and the group of Lifeson, Rutsey, and Perna named themselves Hadrian. After a disastrous gig with Perna, Rutsey invited Lee back and the group continued as Rush.<ref name=PROG13/> In May 1971, the band stabilized as a trio of Lifeson, Rutsey, and Lee. They secured [[Ray Danniels]], a promoter of Rush's early shows, as their manager with his business partner and agent Vic Wilson sharing duties.<ref name=RV88/>

Rush honed their skills with regular gigs, initially touring the Ontario high school circuit. In 1971, the legal drinking age was decreased from 21 to 18, allowing the band to play bars and clubs. Lee said it was at this point that Rush turned "from a basement garage band that played the occasional high school gig to a regular working band playing six days a week."<ref name=PROG13/><ref name=SUP85/> A demo tape was then shipped to various record labels, but Rush was unable to secure a deal, leading to the formation of their own label, [[Moon Records (Canada)|Moon Records]], with Danniels.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Somers |first=Marcie |date=July 4, 2007 |title=Geddy Lee of Rush – Making Music |url=http://www.popentertainment.com/rush.htm |access-date=July 15, 2019 |website=Pop Entertainment |archive-date=July 15, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190715043928/http://www.popentertainment.com/rush.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> Rush entered the studio in 1973 to record their first single; their cover of "[[Not Fade Away (song)#Rush version|Not Fade Away]]" by [[Buddy Holly]] was chosen as it had become a crowd favourite. "You Can't Fight It", an original song, was put on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]. Released in September, it went to No. 88 on the Canadian ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Top Singles chart. In late 1973, Rush performed their first major gig, opening for the [[New York Dolls]] in Toronto, and finished putting down tracks for their first album. The initial sessions produced undesirable results over the sound quality, so tracks were recut and remixed with a new engineer, [[Terry Brown (record producer)|Terry Brown]].<ref name=MR74/> Danniels sold his management company to help raise funds to make the record.<ref name=BH82/> Rutsey wrote the lyrics, but tore them up on the day Lee was to record them and would not produce a new set. Lee quickly wrote a fresh set based on earlier versions, which was used on the final takes.{{sfn|Popoff|2004|pp=13–14}}

[[File:Rush logo.png|thumb|left|The first Rush logo, as seen on their debut album]]
The debut album, ''[[Rush (Rush album)|Rush]]'', was released in March 1974; the initial pressing of 3,500 copies quickly sold out.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kerridge-Porter |first=Nathan |date=March 21, 2014 |title=Rush Reissue Their 1974 Self-Titled Moon Records |url=https://entertainment-focus.com/2014/03/21/rush-reissue-their-1974-self-titled-moon-records/ |access-date=January 4, 2021 |publisher=Entertainment Focus |archive-date=February 4, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210204163117/https://entertainment-focus.com/2014/03/21/rush-reissue-their-1974-self-titled-moon-records/ |url-status=live}}</ref> It went on to peak at No. 86 on the ''RPM'' Top Albums chart. Most critics considered the album highly derivative of [[Led Zeppelin]].<ref name="Led Zeppelin" /> It saw a limited release until it was picked up by [[Donna Halper]], a music director and DJ at rock station [[WMMS]] in [[Cleveland]], Ohio. She added "[[Working Man]]" to the station's regular playlist and the song's blue-collar theme resonated with hard rock fans in the predominantly working class city.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Halper |first=Donna |title=The Rush Discovery Story |url=http://www.rushtrader.com/interviews/discovery.htm |access-date=February 6, 2017 |website=RushTrader |archive-date=June 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190624191019/http://www.rushtrader.com/interviews/discovery.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> In June 1974, Danniels signed Rush to the American booking agency ATI, of which executive Ira Blacker sent a copy of ''Rush'' to [[Mercury Records]].

Following a series of Canadian dates, Rutsey played his last gig with the band on July 25, 1974. His preference for more straightforward rock was incompatible with the more complex music that Lifeson and Lee had written, and Lee recalled Rutsey had a general distaste for life as a touring musician.<ref name="SUP85">{{Cite web |last=Gett |first=Steve |year=1985 |title=Books – Success Under Pressure by Steve Gett |url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19850100gettsuccess.htm |access-date=January 4, 2021 |archive-date=September 15, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190915145909/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19850100gettsuccess.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> His [[juvenile diabetes]] caused further complications, as he required frequent hospital visits to have tests and receive insulin.<ref name=PROG13/><ref name="TCS11">{{Cite web |date=April 6, 2011 |title=The Girl Who Loved Rush: Donna Halper |url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/20110406clevelandsound.htm |access-date=January 1, 2021 |website=The Cleveland Sound |archive-date=February 4, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210204004803/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/20110406clevelandsound.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> For several weeks prior to his departure Rutsey was too ill to perform, leaving Rush to continue with a substitute drummer, Jerry Fielding.<ref name=LS16/>

The band followed ''Fly by Night'' quickly with ''[[Caress of Steel]]'' (1975), a five-track album featuring two extended multi-chapter songs, "The Necromancer" and "[[The Fountain of Lamneth]]".

In light of these events, Rush's record label tried to pressure the members into moulding their next album in a more commercially-friendly and accessible fashion; the band ignored the requests and developed their next album ''[[2112 (album)|2112]]'' with a 20-minute title track divided into seven sections. Despite this, the album was the band's first taste of significant commercial success as it reached No. 5 in Canada,<ref name="worldradiohistory.com" /> becoming their first to reach double Platinum certification.<ref name="CRIA" />

Rush toured ''2112'' between February 1976 and June 1977 with concerts in Canada, the US, and for the first time Europe, with dates in the UK, Sweden, Germany, and the Netherlands.<ref name=SUP85/>{{sfn|Popoff|2004|p=44}} The three sold out shows at [[Massey Hall]], Toronto in June 1976 were recorded for Rush's debut live album, ''[[All the World's a Stage (album)|All the World's a Stage]]''. Released in September of that year, the double LP reached No. 6 in Canada and became Rush's first to crack the US top 40.{{sfn|Popoff|2004|p=53}} ''Record World'' wrote: "Building its American reputation slowly but steadily Rush stands poised for breaking through all the way via this two record live set [...] All the highly charged electricity is here in an explosive setting."<ref name=BH82/> The liner notes includes the statement: "This albums to us, signifies the end of the beginning, a milestone to mark the close of chapter one in the annals of Rush."<ref name=SUP85/>

===1977–1981: Peak progressive era===
After the conclusion of the ''2112'' tour, Rush went to Wales to record ''[[A Farewell to Kings]]'' (1977) and ''[[Hemispheres (Rush album)|Hemispheres]]'' (1978) at [[Rockfield Studios]]. These albums saw the band members expanding the progressive elements in their music. "As our tastes got more obscure," Lee said in an interview, "we discovered more progressive rock-based bands like [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Van der Graaf Generator]] and [[King Crimson]], and we were very inspired by those bands. They made us want to make our music more interesting and more complex and we tried to blend that with our own personalities to see what we could come up with that was indisputably us."<ref>Wanderman, David. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110615053316/http://www.ugo.com/channels/music/features/rush/geddylee.asp "Geddy Lee Interview"]. UGO.com,</ref> Increased synthesizer use, lengthy songs, and highly dynamic playing featuring complex [[time signature]] changes became a staple of Rush's compositions. To achieve a broader, more progressive sound, Lifeson began to experiment with [[Classical guitar|classical]] and [[twelve-string guitar]]s, and Lee added [[Moog Taurus|bass-pedal synthesizers]] and [[Minimoog]]. Likewise, Peart's percussion became diversified in the form of [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangles]], [[glockenspiel]], wood blocks, [[cowbell (instrument)|cowbells]], [[timpani]], [[gong]], and [[tubular bell|chimes]]. Beyond instrument additions, the band kept in stride with the progressive rock trends by continuing to compose long, conceptual songs with science fiction and fantasy overtones. As the new decade approached, Rush gradually began to dispose of its older styles of music in favour of shorter and sometimes softer arrangements. The lyrics up to this point were heavily influenced by classical poetry, fantasy literature, science fiction, and the writings of novelist [[Ayn Rand]], as exhibited most prominently by their 1975 song "Anthem" from ''Fly By Night'' and a specifically acknowledged derivation in ''2112'' (1976).<ref>2112 and Ayn Rand [http://www.nimitz.net/rush/faq2ans.html#62 Rush FAQ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222184534/http://www.nimitz.net/rush/faq2ans.html#62 |date=February 22, 2017}}.

''Signals'' also represented a drastic stylistic transformation apart from instrumental changes. The album contained Rush's biggest hit single, "New World Man", while other more experimental songs such as "Digital Man", "The Weapon", and "Chemistry" expanded the band's use of [[ska]], reggae, and [[funk]].<ref name=BBH100/><ref>{{cite web |title=The Band: 40 Million Records. 40 + Years - About Rush (Moving Pictures) |url=https://www.rush.com/band |website=Rush.com |access-date=May 3, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Visions, the Official Rush Biography, Chapter 10 |url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/BanasiewiczVisions.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927185510/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/BanasiewiczVisions.htm |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |access-date=May 6, 2006 |website=Power Windows |publisher=2112.net}}</ref> The second single, "Subdivisions" reached No. 36 in Canada and No. 5 on the US Album Rock Tracks Chart.

Although the band members consciously decided to move in this overall direction, creative differences between the band and long-time producer Terry Brown began to emerge. The band felt dissatisfied with Brown's studio treatment of ''Signals'', while Brown was becoming more uncomfortable with the increased use of synthesizers in the music.<ref>Rush: Beyond The Lighted Stage Documentary</ref> Ultimately, Rush and Brown parted ways in 1983, and the experimentation with new electronic instruments and varying musical styles would come into further play on their next studio album.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

The style and production of ''Signals'' were augmented and taken to new heights on ''[[Grace Under Pressure (Rush album)|Grace Under Pressure]]'' (1984). It was Peart who named the album, as he borrowed the words of [[Ernest Hemingway]] to describe what the band had to go through after making the decision to leave Terry Brown. Producer [[Steve Lillywhite]], who gained fame with successful productions of [[Simple Minds]] and [[U2]], was enlisted to produce ''Grace Under Pressure''. He backed out at the last moment, however, much to the ire of Lee, Lifeson and Peart. Lee said "Steve Lillywhite is really not a man of his word&nbsp;... after agreeing to do our record, he got an offer from Simple Minds, changed his mind, blew us off&nbsp;... so it put us in a horrible position." Rush eventually hired Peter Henderson to co-produce and engineer the album instead.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Grace Under Pressure |url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/main/GUPlyrics.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091121230808/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/main/GUPlyrics.htm |archive-date=November 21, 2009 |access-date=February 16, 2008 |website=Power Windows |publisher=2112.net}}</ref>

Musically, although Lee's use of sequencers and synthesizers remained the band's cornerstone, his focus on new technology was complemented by Peart's adaptation of Simmons electronic drums and percussion.

With new producer [[Peter Collins (record producer)|Peter Collins]], the band released ''[[Power Windows (album)|Power Windows]]'' (1985) and ''[[Hold Your Fire]]'' (1987). The music on these two albums gives far more emphasis and prominence to Lee's multi-layered synthesizer work. While fans and critics took notice of Lifeson's diminished guitar work, his presence was still palpable. Lifeson, like many guitarists in the mid-to-late 1980s, experimented with processors that reduced his instrument to echoey chord bursts and thin leads. ''Power Windows'' went to No. 2 in Canada while peaking at No. 9 and 10 in the UK and US, respectively. The lead track, "[[The Big Money|Big Money]]" made the Top 50 in Canada, the UK and US, plus No. 4 on the US Mainstream Rock Chart. ''Hold Your Fire'' represents both an extension of the guitar style found on ''Power Windows'', and, according to Allmusic critic Eduardo Rivadavia, the culmination of this era of Rush.<ref> Hold Your Fire Review [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r17147|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic, Eduardo Rivadavia].

Rush started to deviate from its 1980s style with the albums ''[[Presto (album)|Presto]]'' and ''[[Roll the Bones]]''. Produced by record engineer and musician [[Rupert Hine]], these two albums saw Rush shedding much of its keyboard-saturated sound. Beginning with ''Presto'' (1989), the band opted for arrangements notably more guitar-centric than the previous two studio albums. Although synthesizers were still used, the instrument was no longer featured as the centrepiece of Rush's compositions.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gregory Heaney |title=Presto |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/presto-mw0000654443 |access-date=November 24, 2013 |website=Allmusic.com |archive-date=June 10, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610072302/http://www.allmusic.com/album/presto-mw0000654443 |url-status=live}}</ref> Continuing this trend, ''Roll the Bones'' (1991) extended the use of the standard three-instrument approach with even less focus on synthesizers than its predecessor. While musically these albums do not deviate significantly from a general pop-rock sound, Rush incorporated other musical styles such as funk and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] in "Roll the Bones" and jazz in the instrumental track "[[Rush instrumentals#Where's My Thing?|Where's My Thing?]]".<ref>''Roll the Bones'' [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r17152|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic:].

From ''Roll the Bones'', "[[Dreamline]] (No. 1) and "[[Ghost of a Chance (Rush song)|Ghost of a Chance]]" (No. 2) were successful on US Mainstream Rock Radio stations marking a resurgence of Rush's album sales in the US (No. 3 and Platinum), the UK (No. 10) and some other parts of northern Europe.

After the conclusion of the ''Test for Echo'' tour in 1997, the band entered a five-year hiatus primarily due to personal tragedies in Peart's life. Peart's daughter Selena died in a car crash in August 1997, followed by the death of his wife Jacqueline from cancer in June 1998. Peart took a hiatus to mourn and reflect, during which he travelled extensively throughout North America on his BMW motorcycle, covering {{convert|88,000|km|mi|abbr=on}}. At some point in his journey, Peart decided to return to the band. Peart's book ''[[Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road]]'' is a chronicle of his journey.

On January 16, 2018, Lifeson told ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' that it was unlikely that Rush would play any more shows or record new material. He said, "We have no plans to tour or record anymore.

==Musical style and influences==
Rush's musical style changed substantially over the years. Its debut album was strongly influenced by British blues-based hard rock: an amalgam of sounds and styles from such rock bands as [[Black Sabbath]], [[the Who]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]], and [[Led Zeppelin]].<ref name="Led Zeppelin">[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r17116|pure_url=yes}} Rush album] ''Allmusic''.

==Reputation and legacy==
{{Further|List of awards and nominations received by Rush}}
More than 40 years of activity has provided Rush with the opportunity for musical diversity across their discography. As with many bands known for experimentation, changes have inevitably resulted in dissent among critics and fans. The bulk of the band's music has always included synthetic instruments, and this has been a source of contention among fans and critics, especially the band's heavy usage of synthesizers and keyboards during the 1980s, particularly on albums ''Grace Under Pressure'', ''Power Windows'', and ''Hold Your Fire''.<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r17142|pure_url=yes}} "Grace Under Pressure"].

For two decades Peart honed his technique; each new Rush album introduced an expanded percussive vocabulary. In the 1990s, he reinvented his style with the help of drum coach [[Freddie Gruber]].<ref name="geocities">{{Cite web |title=Neil Peart Biography |url=http://www.geocities.com/sunsetstrip/venue/9123/history.html+22:33:16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021045636/http://geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Venue/9123/history.html |archive-date=October 21, 2009 |access-date=January 18, 2008}}</ref>

Rush's triple-CD live album, ''Rush in Rio'' (2003), was certified Gold, marking the fourth decade in which a Rush album had been released and certified at least Gold. In 2004, ''Feedback'' cracked the top 20 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and received radio airplay.

==Live performances==
The members of Rush shared a strong work ethic, desiring to accurately recreate songs from their albums when playing live performances. To achieve this goal, beginning in the late 1980s, Rush included a capacious rack of [[sampler (musical instrument)|digital samplers]] in their concert equipment to recreate the sounds of non-traditional instruments, accompaniments, vocal harmonies, and other sound "events" in real-time to match the sounds on the studio versions of the songs. In live performances, the band members shared duties throughout most songs. Each member had one or more [[MIDI controller]]s, which were loaded with different sounds for each song, and used available limbs to trigger the sounds while simultaneously playing their primary instrument(s).<ref>{{Cite web |date=September 2002 |title=Rush Rolls Again |url=http://www.onstagemag.com/ar/performance_rush_rolls_again/index.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021018005414/http://onstagemag.com/ar/performance_rush_rolls_again/index.htm |archive-date=October 18, 2002 |access-date=December 18, 2010 |publisher=OnStage Magazine}}</ref> It was with this technology that the group was able to present their arrangements in a live setting with the level of complexity and fidelity fans had come to expect, and without the need to resort to the use of [[backing tracks]] or employing an additional band member.<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 1990 |title=Backstage Club Newsletter |url=http://2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19900300backstageclub.htm |access-date=December 31, 2011 |website=Power Windows |publisher=2112.net |archive-date=March 2, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302025240/http://2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19900300backstageclub.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> The band members' coordinated use of pedal keyboards and other electronic triggers to "play" sampled instruments and audio events was subtly visible in their live performances, especially so on R30: 30th Anniversary World Tour, their 2005 concert DVD.{{citation needed|date = March 2018}}

A staple of Rush's concerts was a Neil Peart drum solo. Peart's drum solos included a basic framework of routines connected by sections of improvization, making each performance unique. Each successive tour saw the solo more advanced, with some routines dropped in favour of newer, more complex ones. Since the mid-1980s, Peart had used [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] [[Sound module|trigger pads]] to trigger sounds sampled from various pieces of acoustic percussion that would otherwise consume far too much stage area, such as a [[marimba]], [[harp]], [[temple blocks]], [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangles]], glockenspiel, [[Bell (instrument)|orchestra bells]], tubular bells, and [[vibraslap]] as well as other, more esoteric percussion.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

One prominent feature of Rush's concerts were props on stage, at one point called "diversions". These props have included washing machines, vintage popcorn poppers, or animations and inflatable rabbits emerging from giant hats behind the band.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Joyce |first=Mike |date=May 9, 1990 |title=Colorful Diversions From Rush |work=The Washington Post}}</ref> Starting in the mid-90s, the props often took up Lee's side of the stage ([[Blocking (stage)|stage left]]) as a way to balance out the amp stacks on Lifeson's side (stage right) when Lee opted to use a venue's house system instead of amps.

==Philanthropy==
Rush actively participated in philanthropic causes. The band was one of several hometown favourites to play [[Molson Canadian Rocks for Toronto]], also dubbed SARStock, at [[Downsview Park]] in Toronto on July 30, 2003, with an attendance of over half a million people. The concert was intended to benefit the Toronto economy after the [[SARS]] outbreaks earlier in the year.<ref>{{Cite web |date=July 31, 2003 |title=Stones, AC/DC Rock Toronto Benefit |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/69754/stones-acdc-rock-toronto-benefit |access-date=November 24, 2019 |website=Billboard.com |archive-date=August 19, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819224610/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/69754/stones-acdc-rock-toronto-benefit |url-status=live}}</ref> The band has also sustained an interest in promoting human rights.
