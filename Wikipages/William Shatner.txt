'''William Alan Shatner''' {{postnom|country=CAN|OC}} (born March 22, 1931) is a Canadian actor, author, producer, director, screenwriter, space tourist, and musician. In his seven decades of acting, he is best known for his portrayal of Captain [[James T. Kirk]] of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise.

Shatner began his screen acting career in Canadian films and television productions before moving into guest-starring roles in various American television shows. He appeared as Captain Kirk in all the episodes of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'', 21 of the 22 episodes of ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'', and the first seven [[List of Star Trek films|''Star Trek'' movies]]. Shatner has written a series of books chronicling his experiences playing Captain Kirk, being a part of ''Star Trek'', and life after ''Star Trek''. He has co-written several novels set in the ''Star Trek'' universe and a series of science fiction novels called ''[[TekWar]]'' that were adapted for television. Outside ''Star Trek,'' Shatner also played the eponymous veteran police sergeant in ''[[T. J. Hooker]]'' (1982–1986) and hosted the reality-based television series ''[[Rescue 911]]'' (1989–1996), which won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for Favorite New TV Dramatic Series. Shatner appeared in two episodes of the television detective series ''[[Columbo]]'' almost two decades apart amongst numerous guest star appearances on televison from the 1970s until the 2010s.

After his final appearance as Kirk in ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'' (1994), Shatner continued his acting career. From 2004 until 2008, he starred as attorney [[Denny Crane]] both in the final season of the legal drama ''[[The Practice]]'' and in its spinoff series ''[[Boston Legal]]'', a role that earned him two [[Emmy Award]]s, one on each series. He appeared in both seasons of the comical NBC real-life travelogue with other male companions "of a certain age" in ''[[Better Late Than Never (TV series)|Better Late Than Never]]'', from 2016 to 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/better-late-than-never-cancelled-no-season-three-for-nbc-tv-show/|title=Better Late Than Never: Cancelled; No Season Three for NBC TV Show|last=Pena|first=Jessica|publisher=TV Series Finale|date=July 16, 2018|access-date=July 16, 2018}}</ref> He appeared in seasons 4 and 5 of the [[NBC]] series ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]'' as the alien "[[Big Giant Head]]" to which the main characters reported.

Aside from acting, Shatner has had a music career consisting of eight albums, which began with the release of his debut album ''[[The Transformed Man]]'' (1968). Shatner typically [[Spoken word|speaks lyrics]] in an interpretive reading style. His cover songs usually involve Shatner doing dramatic readings of the lyrics, most famously in his covers of "[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]" and "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]". In 1978, Shatner hosted the [[5th Saturn Awards]] where he performed [[Elton John]]'s "[[Rocket Man (song)|Rocket Man]]", which became widely parodied.<ref>{{Cite web|title=A history of William Shatner's strange musical career in 11 tracks|url=https://www.metv.com/lists/a-history-of-william-shatners-strange-musical-career-in-11-tracks|access-date=October 14, 2021|website=Me-TV Network|language=en|archive-date=April 14, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210414072733/https://www.metv.com/lists/a-history-of-william-shatners-strange-musical-career-in-11-tracks|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2011, Shatner released his third and most successful album ''[[Seeking Major Tom]]'', which features covers of songs such as "[[Learning to Fly (Pink Floyd song)|Learning to Fly]]", "[[Space Oddity]]" and "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]".<ref name="auto">{{cite news|title=William Shatner releases metal album; Shatner's greatest hits|work=The Washington Post|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/blog-post/2011/02/william_shatner_adds_metal_alb.html|access-date=October 14, 2021|archive-date=February 10, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210210214814/http://voices.washingtonpost.com/blog-post/2011/02/william_shatner_adds_metal_alb.html|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2021, [[Blue Origin NS-18|Shatner flew to space]] aboard a [[Blue Origin]] sub-orbital capsule.

==Acting career==
===Early stage, film, and television work===
After graduating from McGill University in 1952, Shatner became the business manager for the Mountain Playhouse in Montreal before joining the Canadian National Repertory Theatre in Ottawa, where he trained as a classical [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] actor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://northerngentleman.com/portrait-of-a-northern-gentleman-william-shatner/|title=Portrait of a Northern Gentleman – William Shatner|date=November 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118220333/http://northerngentleman.com/portrait-of-a-northern-gentleman-william-shatner/|archive-date=January 18, 2017}}</ref> Shatner began performing at the [[Stratford Shakespeare Festival]] in [[Stratford, Ontario]], in 1954. He played a range of roles at the Stratford Festival in productions that included a minor role in the opening scene of a renowned and nationally televised production of [[Sophocles]]'s ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' directed by [[Tyrone Guthrie]], Shakespeare's ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', and [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe's]] ''[[Tamburlaine (play)|Tamburlaine the Great]]'', in which Shatner made his Broadway debut in 1956.<ref name="jordan20100903">{{cite journal |last=Jordan |first=Pat |date=September 5, 2010 |title=The Many Iterations of William Shatner |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/magazine/05Shatner-t.html |journal=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |page=MM24 |access-date=September 4, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429095009/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/magazine/05Shatner-t.html |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archives.stratfordfestival.ca/AIS/Details/people/9510|title=Stratford Festival Archives &#124; Details|website=archives.stratfordfestival.ca|access-date=April 4, 2019|archive-date=April 4, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404175124/https://archives.stratfordfestival.ca/AIS/Details/people/9510|url-status=live}}</ref> Shatner was an understudy to [[Christopher Plummer#Documentaries|Christopher Plummer]] in ''Henry V'', which afforded him the opportunity to distinguish himself for a performance when Plummer could not go on due to illness.

His first feature role came in the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] film ''[[The Brothers Karamazov (1958 film)|The Brothers Karamazov]]'' (1958) with [[Yul Brynner]], in which he starred as the youngest of the Karamazov brothers, Alexei.

In 1959, he received good reviews when he played the role of Lomax in the Broadway production of ''[[The World of Suzie Wong]]''.

He appeared in 2 episodes of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', "[[Nick of Time (The Twilight Zone)|Nick of Time]]" (1960) and "[[Nightmare at 20,000 Feet (The Twilight Zone)|Nightmare at 20,000 Feet]]" (1963). He appeared twice as Wayne Gorham in [[NBC]]'s ''Outlaws'' (1960) Western series with [[Barton MacLane]], and then in another ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' 5th-season episode titled "Mother, May I Go Out to Swim?" In 1961, he starred in the Broadway play ''[[A Shot in the Dark (play)|A Shot in the Dark]]'' with [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]] and directed by [[Harold Clurman]]. [[Walter Matthau]] (who won a [[Tony Award]] for his performance) and [[Gene Saks]] were also featured in the play. Shatner was featured in two episodes of the NBC television series ''[[Thriller (U.S. TV series)|Thriller]]'' ("The Grim Reaper" and "The Hungry Glass") and the film ''[[The Explosive Generation]]'' (1961).

Guthrie called the young Shatner the Stratford Festival's most promising actor, and he was seen as a peer to contemporaries like [[Steve McQueen]], [[Paul Newman]], and [[Robert Redford]]. Shatner was not as successful as the others, but during the 1960s he "became a working actor who showed up on time, knew his lines, worked cheap and always answered his phone." His motto was "Work equals work", however, Shatner's willingness to take any role, no matter how "forgettable", likely hurt his career.{{r|jordan20100903}} He took the lead role in [[Roger Corman]]'s movie ''[[The Intruder (1962 film)|The Intruder]]'' (1962) and received very good reviews for his significant role in the [[Stanley Kramer]] film ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'' (1961). In the 1963–64 season, he appeared in an episode of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series ''[[Channing (TV series)|Channing]]''. In 1963, he starred in the ''[[Family Theater]]'' production called "The Soldier" and received credits in other programs of ''The Psalms'' series. That same year, he guest-starred in ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]'', in the episode "Build Your Houses with Their Backs to the Sea".

In 1964, Shatner guest-starred in Season 2, Episode 2 (titled "[[Cold Hands, Warm Heart]]") of the ABC sci-fi anthology series ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]''. Also that year, he appeared in an episode of the CBS drama ''[[The Reporter (TV series)|The Reporter]]'' ("He Stuck in His Thumb") and co-starred with [[Laurence Harvey]], [[Claire Bloom]], Newman, and [[Edward G. Robinson]] in the Western feature film ''[[The Outrage]]''. 1964 also saw Shatner cast in an episode of ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' that also featured [[Leonard Nimoy]], with whom Shatner would soon be paired in ''Star Trek''. 1964 also saw him as the titular [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] in the pilot for a proposed series called ''Alexander the Great'' alongside [[Adam West]] as [[Cleander of Macedon|Cleander]]. The series was not picked up and the pilot wasn't broadcast until 1968 when it was repackaged as a TV movie to capitalize on West and Shatner's later fame. Shatner hoped that the series would be a major success but West was apparently unsurprised by the rejection, later noting that "It turned out to be one of the worst scripts I have ever read and it was one of the worst things I've ever done."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metv.com/stories/william-shatner-adam-west-alexander-the-great-1964-tv-pilot|title=The failure of one toga-clad TV pilot completely altered the landscape of Sixties pop culture|website=Me-TV Network|access-date=August 28, 2019|archive-date=August 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190828182158/https://www.metv.com/stories/william-shatner-adam-west-alexander-the-great-1964-tv-pilot|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | last1 = Boucher | first1 = Geoff | title = Before they were heroes | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | date = August 6, 2011 | url = https://www.pressreader.com/usa/los-angeles-times/20110806/286564514370681 | access-date = August 28, 2019 | archive-date = August 28, 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190828182202/https://www.pressreader.com/usa/los-angeles-times/20110806/286564514370681 | url-status = live }}</ref>

In 1965, Shatner guest-starred in ''[[Twelve O'Clock High (TV series)|12 O'Clock High]]'' as Major Curt Brown in the segment "I Am the Enemy". He also starred in the critically acclaimed drama ''For the People'' in 1965, as an [[District attorney|assistant district attorney]], co-starring with [[Jessica Walter]]. The program lasted only 13 episodes. Shatner starred in the 1966 [[Gothic fiction|gothic horror]] film ''[[Incubus (1966 film)|Incubus]]'' (Esperanto: Inkubo,) the second feature-length movie ever made with all dialogue spoken in [[Esperanto]]. He also starred in an episode of ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' in 1966 as the character Fred Bateman. He appeared as attorney-turned-counterfeiter Brett Skyler in a 1966 episode of ''[[The Big Valley]]'', "Time to Kill". In 1967, he starred in the little known film ''[[White Comanche]]'' starring as two characters: Johnny Moon, a virtuous half-Comanche gunslinger, and his twin brother Notah, a bloodthirsty warlord.

===''Star Trek''===

{{Main|Star Trek: The Original Series}}
Shatner was cast as Captain James T. Kirk for the second pilot of ''Star Trek'', titled "[[Where No Man Has Gone Before]]". He was then contracted to play Kirk for the ''Star Trek'' series and held the role from 1966 to 1969. During its original run on NBC, the series achieved only modest ratings and was cancelled after three seasons and seventy-nine episodes. In his role as Kirk, Shatner famously kissed actress [[Nichelle Nichols]] (Lt. [[Uhura]]) in the November 22, 1968 ''Star Trek'' episode "[[Plato's Stepchildren]]". The episode is popularly cited as the first example of a kiss between a white man and a black woman on scripted television in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/shattered-tv-taboos-1005496.aspx |title=Shattered TV Taboos: How Bea Arthur and Others Broke Barriers |last=Molloy |first=Tim |date=April 27, 2009 |website=TVGuide.com |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |location=San Francisco, CA |access-date=August 31, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616062610/http://www.tvguide.com/news/shattered-tv-taboos-1005496.aspx |archive-date=June 16, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/entertainment/060907_star_trek.html |title=After 40 Years, Star Trek 'Won't Die' |last=Malik |first=Tariq |date=September 7, 2006 |website=Space.com |publisher=[[TechMediaNetwork]] |access-date=August 31, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008123202/http://www.space.com/entertainment/060907_star_trek.html |archive-date=October 8, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trektoday.com/news/050901_05.shtml |title=Nichols Talks First Inter-Racial Kiss |last=Sparborth |first=Christian Höhne |website=TrekToday |publisher=Christian Höhne Sparborth |location=Utrecht, Netherlands |date=September 5, 2001 |access-date=August 31, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229160018/http://www.trektoday.com/news/050901_05.shtml |archive-date=February 29, 2012 }}</ref> In 1973, he returned to the role of Captain Kirk, albeit only in voice, in the [[Star Trek: The Animated Series|animated ''Star Trek'' series]], which ran for two seasons and twenty-two episodes.

===1970s===
After the cancellation of ''Star Trek'' in early 1969, Shatner experienced difficulty in finding work in the early 1970s, having become somewhat typecast from his role as Kirk. With very little money and few acting prospects, Shatner lost his home and lived in a truck-bed camper in the [[San Fernando Valley]] until small roles turned into higher-paying jobs. Shatner refers to this part of his life as "that period", a humbling time during which he would take any odd job, including small party appearances, to support his family.

Shatner again appeared in various movies, such as Corman's ''[[Big Bad Mama]]'' (1974), the horror film ''[[The Devil's Rain (film)|The Devil's Rain]]'' (1975),{{r|jordan20100903}} ''[[Kingdom of the Spiders]]'' (1977), and the TV movies ''[[The People (film)|The People]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Horror at 37,000 Feet]]'' (1973). Shatner received good reviews as the lead prosecutor in a 1971 [[PBS]] adaptation of Saul Levitt's play ''[[The Andersonville Trial]]''. Other television appearances included a starring role in the western-themed secret agent series ''[[Barbary Coast (TV series)|Barbary Coast]]'' during 1975 and 1976, and guest roles on many 1970s series such as ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'', ''[[Columbo]]'', ''[[The Rookies]]'', ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'', ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'' and ''[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]''. A martial arts enthusiast, Shatner studied [[American Kenpo]] [[karate]] under black belt Tom Bleecker (who trained under the founder of American Kenpo [[Ed Parker]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Shatner was an occasional celebrity guest on ''[[Pyramid (game show)|The $10,000 Pyramid]]'' and ''The $20,000 Pyramid'' in the 1970s, once appearing opposite Leonard Nimoy in a week-long match-up billed as "Kirk vs. Spock". In a notable 1977 appearance, he gave an illegal clue ("the ''blessed''" for ''Things That Are Blessed'' when he intended to say "the [[Virgin Mary]]") at the top of the pyramid ($200), which deprived the contestant of a big money win. He reacted strongly, throwing his chair out of the Winner's Circle.<ref>{{YouTube|id=-UyxR9g7xi4&NR|title="William Shatner blows $20K for a contestant"|link=no}}</ref> Other shows included ''[[The Hollywood Squares]]'', ''[[Celebrity Bowling]]'',{{r|jordan20100903}} ''[[Beat the Clock]]'', ''[[Tattletales]]'', [[Mike Stokey]]'s ''[[Pantomime Quiz#Revivals|Stump the Stars]]'' and ''[[Match Game]]''. [[Richard Dawson]], during an [[Archive of American Television]] interview, mentioned that Shatner was [[Mark Goodson]]'s first choice to host the ''[[Family Feud]]'' pilot in 1976, but (after Dawson's agent sent a sternly worded threat to Goodson)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7539078/|title=Game Changers|last=Thompson|first=J.

===Kirk's return and ''T. J. Hooker''===
After its cancellation, ''Star Trek'' engendered a [[cult following]] during the 1970s from [[syndicated rerun]]s, and Captain Kirk became a [[cultural icon]].{{r|jordan20100903}} Shatner began appearing at [[Science fiction convention|''Star Trek'' conventions]] organized by [[Star Trek fandom|Trekkies]].<ref name="hern19750411">{{cite news |last=Hern |first=Lee |date=April 11, 1975 |title={{-'}}Star Trek' fans still enthusiastic |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Dh5UAAAAIBAJ&dq=shatner%20trek%20convention&pg=6027%2C5877570 |newspaper=[[Boca Raton News]] |agency=[[King Features Syndicate]] |access-date=March 22, 2011 |archive-date=October 15, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211015230223/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Dh5UAAAAIBAJ&dq=shatner%20trek%20convention&pg=6027%2C5877570 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the mid-1970s, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] began pre-production for a revised ''Star Trek'' television series, tentatively titled ''[[Star Trek: Phase II]]''. However, the phenomenal success of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977) led the studio to instead consider developing a ''Star Trek'' motion picture. Shatner and the other original ''Star Trek'' cast members returned to their roles when Paramount produced ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', released in 1979. He would play Kirk in seven ''Star Trek'' films, to include ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'' (1982), ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock]]'' (1984), ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]'' (1986), ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'' (1989), ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'' (1991), and ending with the character's death in ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'' (1994).

Some later appearances in the role of Kirk are in the movie sequences of the video game ''[[Star Trek: Starfleet Academy (video game)|Starfleet Academy]]'' (1997), briefly for a [[Lap giraffe|DirecTV advertisement]] using footage from ''Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country'' running from late summer 2006, and the [[85th Academy Awards|2013 Academy Awards]], in which he reprised the role for a comedic interlude with host [[Seth MacFarlane]].

Although Trekkies resurrected ''Star Trek'' after cancellation, in a 1986 ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch about a ''Star Trek'' convention, Shatner advised a room full of fans to "get a life".<ref name="jenkins1992">{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first=Henry |author-link=Henry Jenkins |year=1992 |title=Textual Poachers: Television Fans & Participatory Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=71U9-cOx_ZwC&q=jindra&pg=PA9 |location=New York |publisher=[[Routledge]] |pages=9–13 |isbn=978-0-415-90572-5 |oclc=26055104 |lccn=92019400 |access-date=November 12, 2013 |archive-date=October 15, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211015214745/https://books.google.com/books?id=71U9-cOx_ZwC&q=jindra&pg=PA9 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{r|jordan20100903}} The much-discussed sketch accurately portrayed his feelings about Trekkies, which the actor had previously discussed in interviews.{{r|jenkins1992}} Shatner was their unwilling subject of adoration for years; as early as April 1968, a group attempted to rip his clothes off as the actor left [[GE Building|30 Rockefeller Plaza]].<ref name="lowry19680329">{{cite news |last=Lowry |first=Cynthia |date=March 29, 1968 |title=TV Fans Save Space Ship Enterprise From Mothballs |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kSgsAAAAIBAJ&pg=821,4386600 |newspaper=[[TimesDaily|Florence Times–Tri-Cities Daily]] |location=Florence, AL |publisher=Tri-Cities Newspapers, Inc. |agency=Associated Press |page=15 |access-date=November 12, 2013 |archive-date=April 17, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210417072415/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kSgsAAAAIBAJ&pg=821,4386600 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Shatner also appeared in the film ''[[Free Enterprise (film)|Free Enterprise]]'' in 1998, in which he played himself and tried to dispel the Kirk image of himself from the view of the film's two lead characters. He also has found an outlet in spoofing the cavalier, almost superhuman, persona of Captain Kirk in films such as ''[[Airplane II: The Sequel]]'' (1982) and ''[[National Lampoon, Incorporated|National Lampoon's]] [[Loaded Weapon 1]]'' (1993). In 1994, he starred as the murderer in the ''[[Columbo]]'' episode "[[List of Columbo episodes#Season 10 and specials|Butterfly in Shades of Grey]]".

Besides the ''Star Trek'' films, Shatner landed a starring role on television as the titular police officer ''[[T. J. Hooker]]'', which ran for five seasons and ninety-one episodes from 1982 to 1986. He then hosted the popular dramatic re-enactment series ''[[Rescue 911]]'' from 1989 to 1996. During the 1980s, Shatner also began directing film and television, directing both numerous episodes of ''T. J. Hooker'' and the feature film Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, though The Final Frontier was not well-received by many Trek fans.

===Subsequent acting and media career===
Shatner has enjoyed success with a series of science fiction novels published under his name, though most are widely believed to have been written by uncredited co-writers such as [[William Thomas Quick|William T. Quick]] and [[Ron Goulart]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Svetkey |first=Benjamin |date=January 15, 1993 |title=I'm Typing as Fast as I Can |url=https://ew.com/article/1993/01/15/william-shatners-story/ |journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |issue=153 |access-date=October 15, 2021 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131142848/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C20216787%2C00.html |archive-date=January 31, 2011 }} Goulart described his role on the "TekWar" books as that of "adviser", though Shatner also credits him with doing rewrites and generally playing a more active role.</ref> The first, published in 1989, was ''[[TekWar]]'', which Shatner claims he developed initially as a screenplay during a Writers Guild strike that delayed production of ''Star Trek V: The Final Frontier''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.retrovisionmag.com/tekworld.htm |title=Designing Tek World |last=Gross |first=Edward |website=RetroVision |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227121114/http://www.retrovisionmag.com/tekworld.htm |archive-date=February 27, 2009 |access-date=April 2, 2011}}</ref> The series of books led to four ''TekWar'' television movies, in which Shatner played the role of Walter Bascom, the lead character's boss. A short-lived [[TekWar (TV series)|television series]] followed, airing on [[USA Network]] and [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] in the United States and [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] in Canada, in which Shatner made several appearances in the Bascom role and directed some of the episodes.

He was the subject of an episode on ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' in December 1989, when he was surprised by [[Michael Aspel]] on the set of the [[Starship Enterprise]] at [[Universal Studios]] in Hollywood.<ref>{{cite web |title=This is Your Life: William Shatner |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0722037/ |website=imdb.com |date=December 27, 1989 |publisher=imbd.com |access-date=October 15, 2021 |archive-date=October 15, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211015201920/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0722037/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1995, a [[first-person shooter]] game called ''[[William Shatner's TekWar]]'' was released. He also played as a narrator in the 1995 American documentary film ''[[Trinity and Beyond]]: The Atomic Bomb Movie'' directed by Peter Kuran. He narrated a television miniseries shot in New Zealand ''[[A Twist in the Tale (1998 TV series)|A Twist in the Tale]]'' (1998). In the television series ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]'', Shatner appeared in several 1999–2000 episodes as the "[[Big Giant Head]]", a high-ranking officer from the same alien planet as the Solomon family who becomes a womanizing party-animal on Earth. The role earned Shatner an Emmy Award nomination.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/bios/william-shatner |title=William Shatner |publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] |access-date=November 12, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112123813/http://www.emmys.com/bios/william-shatner |archive-date=November 12, 2013 }}</ref>

Shatner has appeared in advertisements for many companies and products. In the early 1980s, he appeared in print and television ads endorsing the [[Commodore VIC-20]] [[home computer]].

He reprised the role in the sequel ''[[Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous]]'' (2004), in which Stan Fields was kidnapped in Las Vegas along with the winner of the pageant of the previous year. (Shatner hosted the [[Miss USA]] Pageant in 2001 as a real presenter in Gary, Indiana). In the live-action/animated film ''[[Osmosis Jones]]'' (2001), he voiced Mayor Phlegmming, the self-centred head of the "City of Frank", a community comprising all the cells and microorganisms of a man's body, who is constantly preoccupied with his reelection and his own convenience, even to the detriment of his "city" and constituents. In 2003, Shatner appeared in [[Brad Paisley]]'s "[[Celebrity (Brad Paisley song)|Celebrity]]" and "[[Online (Brad Paisley song)|Online]]" music videos along with [[Little Jimmy Dickens]], [[Jason Alexander]], and [[Trista Rehn]]. Shatner also had a supporting role in the comedy ''[[DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story]]'' (2004), which starred [[Ben Stiller]] and [[Vince Vaughn]]. ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' producer [[Manny Coto]] stated in ''Star Trek Communicator''{{'s}} October 2004 issue that he was preparing a three-episode story arc for Shatner. Shortly thereafter, ''Enterprise'' was cancelled.

After [[David E. Kelley]] saw Shatner's commercials,{{r|jordan20100903}} he brought Shatner on to the final season of the legal drama ''[[The Practice]]''. His Emmy Award-winning role, the eccentric but highly capable attorney Denny Crane, was essentially "William Shatner the man ... playing William Shatner the character playing the character Denny Crane, who was playing the character William Shatner."{{r|jordan20100903}} Shatner took the Crane role to ''[[Boston Legal]]'', and won a Golden Globe, an Emmy in 2005, and was nominated again in 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 for his work. With the 2005 Emmy win, Shatner became one of the few actors (along with co-star [[James Spader]] as [[Alan Shore]]) to win an Emmy Award while playing the same character in two different series. Even rarer, Shatner and Spader each won a second consecutive Emmy while playing the same character in two different series. Shatner remained with the series until its end in 2008 after five seasons and one hundred and one episodes.

Shatner made several guest appearances on ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]'', including cameos reciting [[Resignation of Sarah Palin|Sarah Palin's resignation speech]], Twitter posts, and [[Going Rogue: An American Life|autobiography]]. (Palin herself made a cameo on the show in December 2009, reciting passages from Shatner's autobiography, ''Up Till Now'' in front of Shatner). He has also recited Twitter posts by Levi Johnston, father of Palin's grandson. He also appears in the opening graphics of the occasional feature "[[In the Year 2000|In the Year 3000]]", with his disembodied head floating through space, announcing, "And so we take a cosmic ride into that new millennium; that far off reality that is the year 3000", followed by the tag line, "It's the future, man". He also played the voice of Ozzie the opossum in [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]]' 2006 feature ''[[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]]''.

==Music career==

=== 1968–1998: The Transformed Man and subsequent work ===
Shatner began his musical career with the [[spoken word]] 1968 album ''[[The Transformed Man]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://graphics.latimes.com/vignette-william-shatner-spoken-word-performances/|title=Graphic: William Shatner's spoken-word performances – Los Angeles Times|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507152213/http://graphics.latimes.com/vignette-william-shatner-spoken-word-performances/|archive-date=May 7, 2016}}</ref> delivering exaggerated, interpretive recitations of popular songs like "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]" and "[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]" paired with readings from famous plays.

In 1977 a [[Live album|live]] double album titled ''William Shatner Live'' was released. Recorded on a live tour shortly before, it features Shatner performing excerpts from ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' and [[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]], among other things.<ref>[http://eil.com/shop/moreinfo.asp?catalogid=186678 William Shatner William Shatner Live USA DOUBLE LP (186678)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607073804/http://eil.com/shop/moreinfo.asp?catalogid=186678 |date=June 7, 2011 }}.

In 1978, Shatner hosted the [[5th Saturn Awards]] where he performed [[Elton John]]'s "[[Rocket Man (song)|Rocket Man]]" (again, in a spoken voice). This performance has been widely parodied. Another live double album by Shatner, ''Captain of the Starship'', was also released in 1978.<ref>LaRosa, Frank.

Shatner has occasionally spoofed his earlier musical career. At the [[MTV Movie Awards 1992|1992 ''MTV Movie Awards'']] he performed all five of the Best Song From a Movie nominees. More recently, he performed in the same style for a series of [[Priceline.com]] television commercials. One such commercial featured Shatner with frequent collaborator [[Ben Folds]] performing an irony-laden version of the [[Diana Ross]] hit, "[[Do You Know Where You're Going To?]]". Shatner also appeared on Ben Folds's "In Love" and "Still in Love" (on the album ''[[Fear of Pop: Volume 1]]''). [[Audio Antihero]] founder Jamie Halliday named "In Love" by Fear of Pop and William Shatner as his "favourite song of all time."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goldflakepaint.co.uk/favourite-five-audio-antihero-records/|title=Favourite Five // Audio Antihero Records|date=August 29, 2012|website=GoldFlakePaint|access-date=October 16, 2021|archive-date=October 16, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211016222607/https://www.goldflakepaint.co.uk/favourite-five-audio-antihero-records/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://thefourohfive.com/news/article/the-405-guest-mix-audio-antihero |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 14, 2021 |archive-date=August 15, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815025829/http://thefourohfive.com/news/article/the-405-guest-mix-audio-antihero |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://sydenhamradio.co.uk/presenters/andrew-chatterton/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 14, 2021 |archive-date=July 5, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705035529/http://sydenhamradio.co.uk/presenters/andrew-chatterton/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://onlineantihero.blogspot.co.uk/2010/08/audio-antiheros-never-say-diy-radio.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 14, 2021 |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304132808/http://onlineantihero.blogspot.co.uk/2010/08/audio-antiheros-never-say-diy-radio.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== 2000–present: continuing his solo career ===
In the 2000 film ''[[Miss Congeniality (film)|Miss Congeniality]]'', Shatner performs the song "Miss United States". This song is included in the soundtrack album for the film.

Shatner performed the voice of [[Buzz Lightyear]] in a Star Command anthem called "To Infinity And Beyond" for the 2000 film ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins]]''.

On June 28, 2002, Shatner performed together with Brian Evans at the San Carlos Institute Theatre in [[Key West, Florida]]. He performed the songs "[[What Kind of Fool Am I]]" and "[[The Lady Is a Tramp]]". The concert was later released on the album ''Brian Evans Live with Special Guest: William Shatner''.

In October 2004, Shatner released an album entitled ''[[Has Been]]'', produced and arranged by [[Ben Folds]] and with songs composed by Shatner and Folds. The LP has been critically acclaimed for its unique "pop-driven" style. Its sole cover, a version of [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]]'s "[[Common People (song)|Common People]]" performed with [[Joe Jackson (musician)|Joe Jackson]], received positive reviews.

On June 9, 2005, Shatner performed a reworked rendition of "[[My Way (song)|My Way]]" at the presentation of [[George Lucas]]'s AFI Life Achievement Award, backed by a chorus line of dancers in [[Imperial Stormtrooper]] costumes who ultimately picked up Shatner and carried him offstage. On December 11, 2005, Shatner opened up [[Comedy Central]]'s ''Last Laugh 2005'' by performing as [[Lucifer]], singing a song about how 2005 was a good year for him as the devil.

On March 29, 2006, [[TV Land]] aired an episode of their ''Living in TV Land'' series centered on Shatner and subtitled "William Shatner in Concert". The episode features footage of Shatner working with Ben Folds on ''Has Been'', plus live footage of Shatner performing with Folds' band and Joe Jackson, ending with a defiant rendition of ''The Transformed Man''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" that is punctuated by Shatner [[Finger (gesture)|giving the finger]].

He also appears on the piece "'64 – Go" by [[Lemon Jelly]], featured on their 2005 album ''[['64 - '95]]''.

[[Brad Paisley]]'s music videos for "[[Celebrity (Brad Paisley song)|Celebrity]]" and "[[Online (Brad Paisley song)|Online]]" both feature Shatner as well, with the latter containing a [[meta-reference]] in which Shatner appears to be heartbroken when told he can't sing. He also appears as a studio producer in the music video for "Landed" by Ben Folds.

Also in 2007, a ballet called ''Common People'', set to ''Has Been'', was created by [[Margo Sappington]] (of ''[[Oh! Calcutta!]]'' fame) and performed by the [[Milwaukee Ballet]]. Shatner attended the premiere and had the event filmed. The filmed footage eventually turned into a feature film called ''[[William Shatner's Gonzo Ballet]]'', which had a very well received World Premiere at the [[Nashville Film Festival]] on April 17, 2009.

On July 27, 2009, Shatner gave a "[[poetry slam]]"-style interpretation of [[Resignation of Sarah Palin|Sarah Palin's farewell address]] on ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Newman|first=Craig|date=July 28, 2009|title=Sarah Palin says goodbye – the William Shatner way|publisher=Blogs.suntimes.com|url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/shinyobjects/2009/07/sarah_palin_says_goodbye_-_the_william_shatner_way.html|access-date=August 6, 2010|archive-date=September 9, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909030453/http://blogs.suntimes.com/shinyobjects/2009/07/sarah_palin_says_goodbye_-_the_william_shatner_way.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Mackey|first=Robert|date=July 28, 2009|title=Shatner Performs Palin's 'Poetry'|publisher=New York Times; The Lede|url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/28/shatner-performs-palins-poetry/?hp|access-date=October 23, 2021|archive-date=August 1, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801063852/http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/28/shatner-performs-palins-poetry/?hp|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=July 28, 2009|title=Long before Palin speech, William Shatner did Elton John's "Rocket Man"|work=Los Angeles Times|url=https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/07/long-before-palin-interpretation-william-shatner-did-elton-johns-rocket-man.html|access-date=August 6, 2010|archive-date=June 9, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609033421/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/07/long-before-palin-interpretation-william-shatner-did-elton-johns-rocket-man.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Scherer|first=Michael|date=July 28, 2009|title=William Shatner Reads Sarah Palin|publisher=Swampland.blogs.time.com|url=https://swampland.time.com/2009/07/28/william-shatner-reads-sarah-palin/|access-date=October 23, 2021|archive-date=May 8, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100508143017/http://swampland.blogs.time.com/2009/07/28/william-shatner-reads-sarah-palin/|url-status=live}}</ref> He returned to the ''Tonight Show'' on July 29, 2009, and performed a few of Palin's Twitter "tweets".<ref>{{cite web|date=July 30, 2009|title=William Shatner Returns To 'Tonight' To Tackle Sarah Palin's Tweets|url=http://www.mtv.com/news//2009/07/30/william-shatner-sarah-palin-twitter/|access-date=August 6, 2010|publisher=MTV|archive-date=January 29, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129123503/http://newsroom.mtv.com/2009/07/30/william-shatner-sarah-palin-twitter|url-status=live}}</ref> Shatner went on the ''Tonight Show'' again on December 11, 2009, to read excerpts from Palin's ''[[Going Rogue: An American Life]]'', but this was followed by an appearance from Palin herself reading excerpts from Shatner's autobiography, ''[[Up Till Now]]''.<ref>[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jac50hCoxZ_E2r6zUJUhDmp7sqVQD9CHGTG00] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217035625/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jac50hCoxZ_E2r6zUJUhDmp7sqVQD9CHGTG00|date=December 17, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Tucker|first=Ken|date=December 11, 2009|title=See Sarah Palin out-Shatner William Shatner on 'The Tonight Show'|url=https://ew.com/article/2009/12/11/sarah-palin-the-tonight-show/|access-date=October 15, 2021|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|archive-date=February 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213200852/http://watching-tv.ew.com/2009/12/11/sarah-palin-the-tonight-show/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Carter|first=Bill|date=December 11, 2009|title=Sarah Palin Appears on 'Tonight Show'|work=The New York Times|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/11/sarah-palin-to-appear-on-tonight-show-its-a-surprise/|access-date=August 6, 2010|archive-date=February 26, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226124512/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/11/sarah-palin-to-appear-on-tonight-show-its-a-surprise/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Backed by [[Theme from Star Trek|the musical theme]] from ''Star Trek'', it featured a voice-over based on his spoken introduction from the series' opening credits: "Space, the final frontier. These have been the voyages of the Space Shuttle ''Discovery''. Her 30-year mission: To seek out new science. To build new outposts. To bring nations together on the final frontier. To boldly go, and do, what no spacecraft has done before."<ref>{{cite news|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=March 7, 2011|title='Star Trek' moment for Earth-bound shuttle Discovery|website=space-travel.com|publisher=SpaceDaily|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|location=Gerringong, New South Wales, Australia|url=http://www.space-travel.com/reports/Star_Trek_moment_for_Earth-bound_shuttle_Discovery_999.html|url-status=live|access-date=March 9, 2011|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130202175212/http://www.space-travel.com/reports/Star_Trek_moment_for_Earth-bound_shuttle_Discovery_999.html|archive-date=February 2, 2013}}</ref>

Shatner's second marriage was to Marcy Lafferty, the daughter of producer [[Perry Lafferty]], and lasted from 1973 to 1996.

His third marriage was to Nerine Kidd, from 1997 until her death in 1999. On August 9, 1999, Shatner returned home around 10&nbsp;p.m. to discover Nerine's body at the bottom of their backyard swimming pool. She was 40 years old. An [[autopsy]] detected alcohol and [[Valium]] (diazepam) in her blood, and the coroner ruled the cause of death as accidental drowning. The LAPD ruled out foul play, and the case was closed. Speaking to the press shortly after his wife's death, a clearly shaken and emotional Shatner said that she "meant everything" to him, and called her his "beautiful soulmate".<ref name="quirk">{{cite journal |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=William Shatner: Captain Quirk |url= http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=149333 |journal=[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]] |date=October 3, 2006 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061027171515/http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=149333 |archive-date=October 27, 2006 |access-date=November 12, 2013}}</ref> Shatner urged the public to support Friendly House, a nonprofit organization that helps women reestablish themselves after suffering from alcoholism and drug addiction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue124/news.html|title=Science Fiction News of the Week |website= [[Science Fiction Weekly]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090325130127/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue124/news.html |archive-date=March 25, 2009 |access-date=March 7, 2012}}</ref> He later told [[Larry King]] in an interview that "my wife, whom I loved dearly, and who loved me, was suffering with a disease that we don't like to talk about: alcoholism. And she met a tragic ending because of it."<ref name="quirk" />

In his 2008 book ''Up Till Now: The Autobiography'', Shatner discusses how Leonard Nimoy helped take Nerine to treatment for her alcoholism. Shatner writes in an excerpt from his book:
{{blockquote|Leonard Nimoy's personal experience of alcoholism now came to play a central role in my life and it helped us bond together in a way I never could have imagined in the early days of ''Star Trek''. After Nerine and I had been to dinner with Leonard and Susan Nimoy one evening, Leonard called and said: "Bill, you know she's an alcoholic?" I said I did. I married Nerine in 1997, against the advice of many and my own good sense. But I thought she would give up alcohol for me. We had a celebration in Pasadena, and Leonard was my best man. I woke up about eight o'clock the next morning and Nerine was drunk. She was in rehab for 30 days three different times. Twice she almost drank herself to death. Leonard (sober many years) took Nerine to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, but she did not want to quit.}}

In 2000, a [[Reuters]] story reported that Shatner was planning to write and direct ''The Shiva Club'', a dark comedy about the grieving process inspired by his wife's death.<ref>{{cite news |title=Shatner takes inspiration from tragedy |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=July 4, 2000 |agency=[[Reuters]] |page=E2}}</ref> Shatner's 2004 album ''Has Been'' included a spoken word piece, "What Have You Done", that describes his anguish upon discovering Nerine's body.

In 2001, Shatner married Elizabeth Anderson Martin. In 2004, she co-wrote the song "Together" on Shatner's album ''Has Been''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/song/together-t7265302 |title=Together – William Shatner |website=[[AllMusic]] |publisher=All Media Network |access-date=October 19, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025005727/http://allmusic.com/song/together-t7265302 |archive-date=October 25, 2011 }}</ref> Shatner filed for divorce from Elizabeth in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pagesix.com/2019/12/10/william-shatner-files-for-divorce-after-18-years-of-marriage/|title=William Shatner files for divorce after 18 years of marriage|last=Hirsch|first=Chelsea|date=December 10, 2019|website=Page Six|language=en|access-date=December 12, 2019|archive-date=December 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191211140839/https://pagesix.com/2019/12/10/william-shatner-files-for-divorce-after-18-years-of-marriage/|url-status=live}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=October 2021}} The divorce was finalized in January 2020.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/william-shatner-finalizes-divorce-report|title=William Shatner finalizes divorce from fourth wife, will keep majority of $100 million fortune: report|last=Roberto|first=Melissa|work=Fox News|date=January 29, 2020|access-date=June 3, 2020|archive-date=June 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200603173549/https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/william-shatner-finalizes-divorce-report|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Relationships with other actors===
Shatner first appeared on screen with [[Leonard Nimoy]] in 1964 when both actors guest-starred in an episode of ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'', "The Project Strigas Affair". Much like their characters on ''Star Trek'', Shatner and Nimoy had a professional rivalry that developed into a close friendship. After the show's cancellation in 1969, Shatner and Nimoy reunited in the production of ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'', as well as ''The $20,000 Pyramid'', where "Kirk vs. Spock" appeared on two different tables. Nimoy also guest-starred on ''T. J. Hooker'', in which Shatner played the title role. Despite their decades-long friendship, in 2016 Shatner revealed that he and Nimoy had not spoken in the five years before his death the year before.<ref name="Hollywood Reporter">{{cite web |last1=Wilson Berg |first1=Katie |title=William Shatner Opens Up About Deathbed Rift With Leonard Nimoy and Their Long Friendship (Q&A) |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/william-shatner-opens-up-deathbed-864547/ |website=Hollywood Reporter |date=February 12, 2016 |access-date=June 2, 2021 |archive-date=June 2, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210602215640/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/william-shatner-opens-up-deathbed-864547/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Shatner's bereavement following his wife Nerine's death strengthened his friendship with Nimoy. Nimoy also appeared alongside Shatner at the [[TV Land Award]]s (hosted by [[John Ritter]]).

Nimoy spoke about their mutual rivalry during the ''Star Trek'' years:<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael Seth Starr|title=Shatner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xle9DwAAQBAJ|year=2019|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-1-4930-5065-9|chapter=6|pages=71–72|access-date=May 8, 2020|archive-date=March 5, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210305211343/https://books.google.com/books?id=xle9DwAAQBAJ|url-status=live}}</ref>

{{blockquote|Bill's energy was very good for my performance, because Spock could then be the cool individual. Our chemistry was successful right from the start. [We were] very competitive, with a sibling rivalry up to here, and after the show had been on the air a few weeks and they started to get a lot of mail about Spock, then the dictum came down from NBC: "Oh, give us more of that guy! They love that guy!" Well, that can be a problem for a leading man who's hired as the star of the show.|Leonard Nimoy}}

On an episode of the [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] series ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'', where it was also divulged that Nimoy was Shatner's best man at his wedding with his fourth wife Elizabeth, Nimoy said, "Bill Shatner hogging the stage? No. Not the Bill Shatner I know." When Nimoy died in 2015, Shatner said, "I loved him like a brother. We will all miss his humor, his talent, and his capacity to love." Although Shatner was unable to attend Nimoy's funeral due to other commitments, his daughters attended in his place, and Shatner created his own online memorial for Nimoy.

Shatner has been friends with actress [[Heather Locklear]] since 1982 when she began co-starring with him on ''T. J. Hooker''. As she was also appearing in a semi-regular role in another [[Aaron Spelling]] production, ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'', Locklear was asked by ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' whether her schedule was difficult. She replied, "I'd get really nervous and want to be prepared" for Shatner and for the experienced cast of ''Dynasty''. After ''T.J. Hooker'' ended, Shatner helped Locklear get other roles. She supported Shatner in 1999 when he was mourning Nerine's death. In 2005, Locklear appeared in two episodes of Shatner's ''Boston Legal'' as Kelly Nolan, a woman being tried for killing her much older, wealthy husband. Shatner's character is attracted to Nolan and tries to insert himself into her defence.{{Clarify|date=November 2014}} Asked how she came to appear on ''Boston Legal'', Locklear said, "I love the show. It's my favorite show, and I sorta kind of said, 'Shouldn't I be William Shatner's illegitimate daughter, or his love interest?'"

For years, some of Shatner's ''Star Trek'' co-stars accused him of being difficult to work with, particularly [[George Takei]], [[Walter Koenig]], and [[James Doohan]], the latter two of whom Shatner acknowledges in his autobiography ''Star Trek Movie Memories''. In 2011, Koenig appeared on Shatner's interview series ''Shatner's Raw Nerve'', and made clear that the animosity he once held was long over.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1774110/|title=Walter Koenig|via=IMDb|access-date=June 30, 2020|archive-date=March 9, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210309052049/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1774110/|url-status=live}}</ref> His feud with Takei was mentioned in Takei's 2004 memoir, ''[[To the Stars: The Autobiography of George Takei|To the Stars]]''.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Jen|last1=Yamato|access-date=June 18, 2021|title=William Shatner on 50 Years of 'Star Trek,' the Passing of David Bowie, and Pal Leonard Nimoy|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/01/20/william-shatner-on-50-years-of-star-trek-the-passing-of-david-bowie-and-pal-leonard-nimoy|newspaper=The Daily Beast|date=January 20, 2016|via=www.thedailybeast.com|archive-date=May 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170530211614/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/01/20/william-shatner-on-50-years-of-star-trek-the-passing-of-david-bowie-and-pal-leonard-nimoy|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first1=Tucker|last1=Archer|access-date=June 18, 2021|title=Inside William Shatner & George Takei's Decades-Long Feud|url=https://heavy.com/entertainment/star-trek/william-shatner-george-takei-feud-why/|date=January 14, 2021|archive-date=June 24, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624201855/https://heavy.com/entertainment/star-trek/william-shatner-george-takei-feud-why/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the 1990s, Shatner made numerous attempts to reconcile with Doohan, but was unsuccessful for some time, Doohan being the only former ''Star Trek'' co-star refusing to be interviewed by Shatner for his 1993 memoir ''[[Star Trek Memories]]''. Doohan did participate in the 1994 follow-up, ''Star Trek Movie Memories'', and an [[Associated Press]] article published at the time of Doohan's final convention appearance in August 2004 stated that Doohan, already suffering from severe health problems, forgave Shatner and they mended their relationship. At a convention directly preceding Doohan's last one, Sky Conway, the convention's head, stated, "At our show: 'The Great Bird of the Galaxy' in El Paso, Texas in November 2003, a celebration of Gene Roddenberry and ''Star Trek'', Bill and Jimmy went on stage together. Behind the scenes and before they went on stage, they hugged each other, apologized and expressed their love and admiration for each other. Bill specifically asked me to get them together so he could make amends and clear the air between the two of them before it was too late."<ref>{{cite news |last=Pascale |first=Anthony |date=December 9, 2010 |url=http://trekmovie.com/2010/12/09/george-takei-william-shatner-refused-to-appear-on-stage-with-james-doohan-at-farewell-con/ |title=George Takei: William Shatner Refused To Appear On-Stage With James Doohan At Farewell Con |work=TrekMovie.com |access-date=October 11, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006133257/http://trekmovie.com/2010/12/09/george-takei-william-shatner-refused-to-appear-on-stage-with-james-doohan-at-farewell-con/ |archive-date=October 6, 2014 }}</ref>

===Health===
Shatner suffers from [[tinnitus]], which he believes might be the result of a [[pyrotechnics|pyrotechnical]] accident on set while shooting the ''Star Trek'' episode "[[Arena (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Arena]]", though he did not begin to suffer symptoms until the early 1990s, about a quarter century later. Shatner is involved in the [[American Tinnitus Association]].
