'''Chic''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|iː|k}} {{respell|SHEEK|'}}), currently called '''Nile Rodgers & Chic''', is an American band that was organized in 1972 by guitarist [[Nile Rodgers]] and bassist [[Bernard Edwards]].<ref name="Huey"/> It recorded many commercially successful [[disco]] songs, including "[[Dance, Dance, Dance (Yowsah, Yowsah, Yowsah)]]" (1977), "[[Everybody Dance (Chic song)|Everybody Dance]]" (1977), "[[Le Freak]]" (1978), "[[I Want Your Love (Chic song)|I Want Your Love]]" (1978), "[[Good Times (Chic song)|Good Times]]" (1979), and "[[My Forbidden Lover]]" (1979). The group regarded themselves as a rock band for the disco movement "that made good on hippie peace, love and freedom".<ref name=Christgau>[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/books/review/le-freak-an-upside-down-story-of-family-disco-and-destiny-by-nile-rodgers-book-review.html?pagewanted=1&_r=2 The Rock Days of Disco] by [[Robert Christgau]] for The New York Times December 2, 2011</ref> In 2017, Chic was nominated for induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] for the eleventh time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/music/news/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-2017-nominees-tupac-journey-1201890991 |title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 2017 Nominees Include Tupac Shakur, Journey, Chic |website=Variety.com |date=2016-10-18 |access-date=2018-02-01}}</ref>

==History==
===1970–1978: Origins and early singers===
[[Nile Rodgers]] and Bernard Edwards met in 1970, as session musicians working in the New York City area. They formed a rock band named The Boys and later The Big Apple Band, playing numerous gigs around New York City.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book

They were later in the band New York City, which had a hit record in 1973 with "I'm Doing Fine Now", charting in the UK. The original demo tapes were made by DJ/studio engineer Robert Drake, who first played [[Acetate disc|lacquer records]] while DJing at a New York after hours club, Night Owl. New York City broke up in 1976.

After [[Walter Murphy]] released the single and album "[[A Fifth of Beethoven]]" under the name Walter Murphy and the Big Apple Band, they changed their name to Chic.

Inspired after attending a concert by English [[glam rock]] band [[Roxy Music]], Rodgers began developing the idea for a group whose music and image would form a seamless and immersive whole, taking additional influence from the anonymous, make-up wearing American rock band [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]].<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s2TTEJDvwY|title=Nile Rodgers Talks about Roxy Music and KISS|date=October 21, 2011|work=YouTube}}</ref> During 1977, Edwards and Rodgers recruited drummer [[Tony Thompson (drummer)|Tony Thompson]], formerly with [[Labelle]] and [[Ecstasy, Passion & Pain]], to join the band; they performed as a trio doing [[cover song|cover versions]] at various gigs.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Thompson recommended keyboardist Raymond Jones, 19, to join the band, as he had worked with him in Ecstasy, Passion & Pain. Needing a singer to become a full band, they engaged [[Norma Jean Wright]] by an agreement permitting her to have a solo career in addition to her work for the band.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Using a young [[recording engineer]], [[Bob Clearmountain]], they created the track "[[Dance, Dance, Dance (Yowsah, Yowsah, Yowsah)]]". As a result, Chic became a support act. The title of the first song recorded as Chic was "[[Everybody Dance (Chic song)|Everybody Dance]]", which was on their first album.

Under contract with [[Atlantic Records]] company, during 1977 they released the self-titled debut album ''[[Chic (album)|Chic]]'', which was an extension of the demonstration tape. But Edwards and Rodgers were convinced that to produce the band's recording studio sound when performing live with sound and visuals, they needed to add another female singer. Wright suggested her friend Luci Martin, who became a member during late winter/early spring of 1978.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Soon after the sessions ended for the debut album, the band members began to work on Wright's self-titled debut solo album ''[[Norma Jean (album)|Norma Jean]]'', released during 1978. This album included the successful nightclub song "Saturday". To facilitate Wright's solo career, the band had agreed to contract her with a separate record company.

The legal details of this contract eventually forced Wright to end her relationship with the band during mid-1978, but she participated in the sessions for Chic-produced [[Sister Sledge]] album ''[[We Are Family (album)|We Are Family]]'' (1979).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> She was replaced as a singer by Alfa Anderson, who had done back-up vocals on the band's debut album. For the Sister Sledge project, Edwards and Rodgers wrote and produced "He's the Greatest Dancer" (originally intended to be a Chic song), in exchange for "[[I Want Your Love (Chic song)|I Want Your Love]]" (intended originally to be performed by Sister Sledge).

===1978–1979: "Le Freak" and "Good Times"===
The group endeavored to express "deep hidden meaning" in every song they wrote.<ref name=Christgau/> During late 1978, the band released the album ''[[C'est Chic]]'', containing one of its better-known tracks, "[[Le Freak]]". It was created in a jam session in Edwards' apartment, after they had failed on [[New Year's Eve]] 1977 to meet with [[Grace Jones]] at New York's nightclub [[Studio 54]]. The original refrain "Aaa, fuck off", intended for the doormen of Studio 54, was replaced that night with "Aaa, freak out", after trying a version with "Aaa, freak off".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/apr05/articles/classictracks.htm|title=CLASSIC TRACKS: Chic 'Le Freak'|publisher=Sound on Sound|date=April 2005|access-date=October 12, 2008}}</ref> The resulting single was a great success, scoring No. 1 on the US charts<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> and selling more than six million copies. It was the best-selling single album ever of [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]]'s parent company, [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music]], until [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s "[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]" in 1990.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.loc.gov/static/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/documents/LeFreak.pdf |title=Le Freak - Chic (1978) |last=O'Dell |first=Cary |publisher= [[Library of Congress]]|access-date= May 15, 2015}}</ref> On March 21, 2018 "Le Freak" was selected for preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or artistically significant".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-18-028/|title=National Recording Registry Reaches 500|website=[[Library of Congress]]|access-date=September 9, 2018}}</ref>

The next year, the group released the ''[[Risqué (album)|Risqué]]'' album and the lead track "[[Good Times (Chic song)|Good Times]]", one of the most influential songs of the era. The track was the basis of [[Grandmaster Flash]]'s "Adventures on the Wheels of Steel" and the [[Sugarhill Gang]]'s breakthrough [[hip hop music|hip hop]] music single "[[Rapper's Delight]]". It has been sampled since by many dance and hip hop acts, as well as being the inspiration for [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[Another One Bites the Dust]]" (1980), [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s "[[Rapture (Blondie song)|Rapture]]" (1981), [[Captain Sensible]]'s "Wot?" (1982) and, two decades later, the bass line for [[Daft Punk]]’s "[[Around the World (Daft Punk song)|Around the World]]" (1997).

At the same time, Edwards and Rodgers composed, arranged, performed, and produced many influential disco and [[R&B]] records for various artists, including [[Sister Sledge]]'s albums ''[[We Are Family (album)|We Are Family]]'' (1979) and ''[[Love Somebody Today]]'' (1980); [[Sheila (and) B. Devotion|Sheila and B. Devotion]]'s "Spacer"; [[Diana Ross]]'s 1980 album ''[[Diana (album)|Diana]]'', which included the successful singles "[[Upside Down (Diana Ross song)|Upside Down]]", "[[I'm Coming Out]]" and "[[My Old Piano]]"; [[Carly Simon]]'s "[[Why (Carly Simon song)|Why]]" (from 1982 soundtrack ''[[Soup for One (film)|Soup for One]]''); and [[Debbie Harry]]'s debut solo album ''[[KooKoo]]'' (1981).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> An album recorded with [[Johnny Mathis]] was rejected by his label and remained unreleased until 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://open.spotify.com/album/4Y21CVaS4Be1B4wavY5qKi?si=UNX7w7h2Tx6ozmHeL9u4ug|title = I Love My Lady|website = [[Spotify]]|date = December 8, 2017}}</ref>

Chic also introduced a young session vocalist, [[Luther Vandross]], who sang on Chic's early albums.

=== 1980s–1990s: Disbanding, other projects, a brief reunion ===
After the [[Disco#Backlash and decline|anti-disco reaction]] at the end of the 1970s, the band struggled to obtain both airplay and sales, and during the early 1980s they disbanded. Rodgers and Edwards produced records for a variety of artists together and separately. The Chic rhythm section of Rodgers, Edwards, and Thompson provided instrumental back-up for the successful 1980 album ''[[Diana (album)|Diana]]'' for [[Diana Ross]] that ended up selling over ten million albums internationally, with Rodgers and Edwards producing. It yielded the four weeks at number-one single "[[Upside Down (Diana Ross song)|Upside Down]]" and the top ten song "[[I'm Coming Out]]". "[[My Old Piano]]" was also a top ten single for Ross in the United Kingdom. Rodgers co-produced [[David Bowie]]'s 1983 album ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]'' and was also responsible largely for the early success of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] during 1984 with her ''[[Like a Virgin (album)|Like a Virgin]]'' album, which again reunited Rodgers, Thompson, and Edwards, with keyboardist Rob Sabino and collaborators Jeff Bova, Jimmy Bralower and Oren Bar. During 1984, Rodgers was involved with a project of the band [[The Honeydrippers]] and helped produce [[The Honeydrippers: Volume One|that band's only EP]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Thompson and Edwards worked with the group [[Power Station (band)|Power Station]] on its successful 1985 album, as well as Power Station main singer [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]]'s solo success ''[[Riptide (album)|Riptide]]'' that same year, both of which Edwards produced. 1985 saw Rodgers producing the [[Thompson Twins]] successful ''[[Here's to Future Days]]'' album, and appearing live with them and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] at [[Live Aid]] in Philadelphia. During 1986, Rodgers produced the fourth album from [[Duran Duran]], ''[[Notorious (Duran Duran album)|Notorious]]''. Bernard Edwards later gave Duran Duran's bassist John Taylor the bass guitar he played on many of Chic's songs. Taylor had long been a Chic fan, his style influenced greatly by Edwards' playing.

After a 1989 birthday party where Rodgers, Edwards, [[Paul Shaffer]], and [[Anton Fig]] played old Chic songs, Rodgers and Edwards organized a reunion of the old band. They recorded new material – a single, "[[Chic Mystique]]" (remixed by [[Masters at Work]]) and subsequent album ''[[Chic-ism]]'' (1992), both of which charted— and played live all over the world, to great audience and critical acclaim.

During 1996, Rodgers was honored as the Top Producer in the World in ''[[Billboard Magazine]]'', and was named a JT Super Producer. That year, he performed with Bernard Edwards, Sister Sledge, [[Steve Winwood]], [[Simon Le Bon]], and [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] in a series of commemorative concerts in Japan. His longtime musical partner Edwards died of [[pneumonia]] at age 43 during the trip on April 18, 1996. His final performance was recorded and released as ''[[Live at the Budokan (Chic)|Live at the Budokan]]'' (1999). Chic continued to tour with new musicians.

===2000–2013: Compilations, nominations, and venues===
[[File:Chic 2013.JPG|thumb|right|200px|upright=1.75|Rodgers and Barnes onstage in 2013.]]

In 2013, Chic with Nile Rodgers headlined the West Holts Stage on Friday night at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] in the UK, and played a variety of tracks both from Chic and from Nile Rodgers' extensive list of songs he had worked on for other artists. [[Noel Gallagher]] noted "My favorite act at this year's Glastonbury, when I went, was not the Rolling Stones, as great as they were; was not the Arctic Monkeys, as good as they were; was not Disclosure, as good as they were; but it was Chic. They were fucking mega. Absolutely out of this world."<ref>{{cite web|last=Vozick |first=Simon |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/noel-gallaghers-epic-year-end-gripe-session-20131205 |title=Noel Gallagher's Epic Year-End Gripe Session Tackles Kanye West, Arcade Fire |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2013-12-05 |access-date=2014-08-10}}</ref>

Rodgers described how a lick he played to test a freshly-repaired guitar caught the ear of DJ [[Nicky Romero]], ending as an important part of a "huge song" on the upcoming album. Rodgers assumed "It sounds like a pop record".<ref name="Chich-2015">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/code/5894015/nile-rodgers-talks-new-chic-album-premieres-solo-track-in-google|title=Nile Rodgers Talks New Chic Album, Premieres Solo Track in Google Hangout: Watch|author=Billboard Staff|work=Billboard|publisher=Proemtheus Global Media|date=February 5, 2014|access-date=February 5, 2015}}</ref>

During the second and fourth leg of the American singer-actress [[Cher]]'s 2019 tour, Chic served as the opening act.

==Influences and awards==
In addition to refining a relatively minimalist disco sound, Chic helped to inspire other artists to create their own sound. For example, [[The Sugarhill Gang]] used "Good Times" as the basis for its success "[[Rapper's Delight]]" (1979), which helped initiate the [[hip-hop music|hip hop]] recorded music format that is known today. "Good Times" was used also by [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]] on its hit "[[The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel]]", which was used in the end sequence of the first hip-hop movie, ''[[Wild Style]]'', from 1982. [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s 1980 US number-one song "[[Rapture (Blondie song)|Rapture]]" was not only influenced by "Good Times" but was a direct tribute to Chic, and main singer [[Debbie Harry|Deborah Harry]]'s 1981 debut solo album ''[[Koo Koo]]'' was produced by Edwards and Rodgers.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Chic was cited as an influence by many successful bands from Great Britain during the 1980s. [[John Taylor (bass guitarist)|John Taylor]], the bassist from [[Duran Duran]] claims the bass part of their top 10 single "[[Rio (song)|Rio]]" (1982) was influenced by Edwards' work with Chic.<ref>Classic Albums episode</ref> Even [[Johnny Marr]] of [[The Smiths]] has cited the group as a formative influence. Rodgers' guitar work has been so emulated as to become commonplace, and Edwards' lyrical bass is also much-cited in music circles, as is Thompson's recorded drumwork. [[Queen (band)|Queen]] got the inspiration for its single "[[Another One Bites the Dust]]" (1980) from Bernard Edwards' familiar bass guitar riff on "[[Good Times (Chic song)|Good Times]]" after [[John Deacon]] met the band in [[Avatar Studios|The Power Station]] recording studio.<ref name="Jonisledgeonline.com">{{cite web|url=http://jonisledgeonline.com/healter-skelter-publising-everybody-dance-chic-politics-disco/ |title=Healter Skelter Publising: Everybody Dance – Chic and the Politics of Disco |publisher=Jonisledgeonline.com |date=2013-07-18 |access-date=2014-04-17}}</ref>

The French duo [[Modjo]] used the guitar sample from Chic's "Soup for One", as the basic theme for their single, "[[Lady (Hear Me Tonight)]]". Chic influenced the vocal and music style of the Italian-American disco band [[Change (band)|Change]], which had a series of successes during the early 1980s. The two acts also had a couple of things in common: Chic alumnus [[Luther Vandross]] was also Change's vocalist upon the latter's formation, and Change, like Chic, were signed to Atlantic through its distributed RFC label.
