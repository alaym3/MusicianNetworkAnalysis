'''Propaganda''' are a German [[synth-pop]] band formed in [[Düsseldorf]] in 1982. They were one of the initial roster of acts signed to [[Trevor Horn]]'s [[ZTT]] label, between 1984 and 1986, during which they released the critically acclaimed album ''[[A Secret Wish]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|date=1986-03-29|title=The Morning Call, 29 Mar 1986|pages=59|work=The Morning Call|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/65862488/the-morning-call-29-mar-1986/|access-date=2020-12-23}}</ref>

== History ==
=== 1982–1984: Early history ===
Propaganda was formed in [[Düsseldorf]], [[West Germany]], in 1982, by [[Ralf Dörper]] (a member of the German [[industrial music|industrial]] band [[Die Krupps]]). As a trio, with artist Andreas Thein and vocalist Susanne Freytag, the group made initial recordings in Germany which were destined for future release in the UK, where Ralf Dörper's early experimental recordings had received critical acclaim by radio DJ [[John Peel]] and journalist Chris Bohn (aka Biba Kopf). With the inclusion of classically trained musician and composer, Michael Mertens, and singer [[Claudia Brücken]] (who had worked with Freytag in her previous band, The Topolinos), music journalist [[Paul Morley]] signed the band to [[Trevor Horn]]'s newly formed [[ZTT Records]] label.<ref name="Larkinindie">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Indie and New Wave Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-579-4|pages=221/2}}</ref>

The group relocated to the United Kingdom and released the single "[[Dr. Mabuse (Propaganda song)|Dr. Mabuse]]",<ref name="Larkinindie"/> named after the [[Doctor Mabuse|fictional character]] made famous by filmmaker [[Fritz Lang]]. The single reached the Top 30 in the [[UK Singles Chart]],<ref name="Larkinindie"/> and the Top 10 in Germany. The group appeared on various TV shows in the UK, including Channel 4's ''[[The Tube (TV series)|The Tube]]''. Here, as well as performing "Dr. Mabuse", the group also gave one of its few performances of a cover version of [[Throbbing Gristle]]'s song "[[Discipline (Throbbing Gristle single)|Discipline]]".<ref>{{YouTube|7DAIQh6VFr0}}</ref>

Before the year was out, Thein was asked to leave the band due to musical differences. With Mertens now filling the gap left by his departure, the band forged ahead with recording its follow-up single and debut album. However both of these were to be delayed as a result of the unexpectedly huge success of ZTT's most famous signing, [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]].<ref name="Larkinindie"/> As the label was still in its infancy, ZTT was forced to spend all its limited resources on promoting and marketing Frankie Goes to Hollywood, and this also meant that Trevor Horn was not available to produce Propaganda's album.<ref name="Larkinindie"/> [[Stephen Lipson]], one of Horn's established studio engineers, took his place along with [[Andy Richards]] playing keyboards, but the delay meant that Propaganda's second single, the more pop-oriented "[[Duel (Propaganda song)|Duel]]", did not surface until April 1985.<ref name="Larkinindie"/> Perhaps the band's most recognisable release, it was also their highest-charting single in the UK, reaching number 21. The band made its single appearance on the flagship BBC music programme ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in June of that year. The song was the main theme of the soundtrack of the Italian comedy [[Yuppies_(film)|Yuppies, i giovani di successo]] (Yuppies, the successful youngsters) of 1986, and was also used as the theme music for the [[World Rally Championship]] (WRC) in 2005, the alternate version "Jewelled" having also been used as the theme music for the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Top Gear (1977 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' [[Rally GB|RAC Rally]] Report programmes in the late 1980s. In 1986 it featured, uncredited, in the episode ''The fix'' of the American hit-series ''Miami Vice'', together with ''P:Machinery''.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2825018/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1|title = Propaganda|website=IMDb.com}}</ref>

In May 1985, with Frankie Goes to Hollywood becoming [[tax exile]]s in Ireland, the band effectively headlined "The Value of Entertainment", a series of showcase gigs of ZTT signings, held at the [[Ambassadors Theatre (London)|Ambassadors Theatre]] in London. The shows also featured [[Art of Noise]], [[Anne Pigalle]], [[Andrew Poppy]] and [[Instinct (band)|Instinct]]. Propaganda were joined on stage by former [[Simple Minds]] bassist [[Derek Forbes]] and ex-[[Japan (band)|Japan]] drummer [[Steve Jansen]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/release/819687 |title=''ZTT: The Value Of Entertainment (Time Capsule Version)'' laserdisc|website=Discogs.com |access-date=8 April 2008}}</ref>

=== 1985: ''A Secret Wish'' ===
The first week of July 1985 finally saw the release of the band's debut album, ''[[A Secret Wish]]''.<ref name="Larkinindie"/> After receiving considerable critical acclaim and some commercial success, it reached number 16 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. The album was followed by another single, "[[p:Machinery]]", in August 1985,<ref name="Larkinindie"/> which only reached number 50 in the UK, but becoming a bigger hit in Italy, France, the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland and even being used in the hit US TV Show ''[[Miami Vice]]'' (1986 episode: ''The Fix'').<ref name="auto"/> The 12-inch version of this release caused controversy (even within the group) as Paul Morley thought it was a good idea to have the sleeve feature a quote by writer [[J. G. Ballard]], praising the activities of the German extremist group [[Red Army Faction]]. [[Ariola Records|Ariola]], who distributed ZTT's releases in Germany, refused to carry the 12" as a result, so the quote was changed on the German release to another by Ballard, on the aesthetic perfection of German suburbs.

The group spent the rest of the year on their "Outside World" tour, taking in Europe and America. They were joined once again by Derek Forbes on bass, with his fellow ex-Simple Minds colleagues [[Brian McGee (drummer)|Brian McGee]] on drums, and [[Kevin Armstrong (guitarist)|Kevin Armstrong]] on guitar, with backing tapes used for most of the keyboard parts. In the meantime a remix album, ''[[Wishful Thinking (Propaganda album)|Wishful Thinking]]'', was released in November 1985. Originally intended for the American club market, the album was also released in Europe, but against the wishes of the group themselves. The album peaked at number 82 in the UK. A remixed version of "p:Machinery" was also re-released as a single, only four months after its original release. In the UK, it too failed to make an impact and peaked at number 83, but was, again, more successful in France and Germany.

=== 1986–1987: Split ===
After making a second appearance on ''The Tube'' in January 1986, things went quiet for Propaganda. In late 1985, its management had introduced the band to the London-based music lawyer Brian Carr of Compton Carr, who had helped to win the case between [[John Lydon]] ([[Sex Pistols]]/[[Public Image Ltd.]]) and his management. Carr explained to the group members that under their current contracts with ZTT, they could go on making records for the rest of their lives and never make any money from them. Based on this information the band asked ZTT to renegotiate the contracts, which the company declined. Soon afterwards Claudia Brücken left Propaganda to pursue a solo career, remaining signed to ZTT.<ref name="Larkinindie"/> After a protracted legal battle, which saw the remaining members of Propaganda under an injunction by ZTT for fourteen months, they were finally released from their contract to ZTT in a hurried out-of-court settlement in the summer of 1987.<ref name="Larkinindie"/> Claudia Brücken formed the duo [[Act (band)|Act]] with [[Thomas Leer]] in 1988,<ref name="Larkinindie"/> and in 1991 she released a solo album (''[[Love: And a Million Other Things]]'') for [[Island Records]].<ref name="Larkinindie"/>

=== 1988–1997: New line-up ===
In 1988, the band (initially still including Ralf Dörper and Susanne Freytag) signed to [[Virgin Records]], and began recording new material. Alongside Michael Mertens was the new line-up of American vocalist [[Betsi Miller]], with bassist Derek Forbes and drummer Brian McGee (both ex-Simple Minds) who had both actually joined the band following their split with ZTT in 1986.<ref name="Larkinindie"/> The result was a new album, released in 1990 called ''[[1234 (Propaganda album)|1234]]'',<ref name="Larkinindie"/> produced by former [[Tears For Fears]]' associates [[Ian Stanley]] and [[Chris Hughes (record producer)|Chris Hughes]], Miller's future husband. Some of Dörper's lyrics were used and Freytag also made a guest appearance on the album. David Gilmour of [[Pink Floyd]] played guitar on what was to be the second single taken from the album, "Only One Word".{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The first single from the album, "Heaven Give Me Words", reached the UK Top 40, and the album peaked at number 46 in the UK. Although the album was not as successful as ''A Secret Wish'', it gave Propaganda its only real number 1 hit, with "Wound in My Heart" becoming a big success in South America and reaching number 1 in Argentina in 1990.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

=== 1998–2004: Reunion and second split ===
In 1998, Mertens, Brücken, and Freytag reunited, signed an options deal with [[East West Records]], and began working on new material. Several tracks were completed, including one produced by [[Tim Simenon]] and featuring [[Depeche Mode]]'s [[Martin Gore]] on guitar. A video for one song, "No Return", was produced in [[Morocco]] and directed by "[[Keyser Söze|Keyser Soze]]" in December 1998. Two minute clips of it, along with photos of the shoot, were released via the band's official website in early 2000. However, no album materialized and, in January 2002, Brücken announced, "The reunion was worth a try, but did not work out."{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In 2002, an untitled nine-track CD was leaked via file-sharing networks on the Internet. Track titles were "Ignorance", "Who's the Fool", "Beast Within", "No Return", "To the Future", "Turn to the Sun", "Dream Within a Dream", "Cloud 9" and "Anonymous". "Cloud 9" was later recorded by Brücken and former [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark|OMD]] member [[Paul Humphreys]] for their act [[Onetwo (band)|Onetwo]]. It first appeared on their 2004 5-track EP ''[[Item (EP)|Item]]''; then appeared again in 2007 on their album ''[[Instead (album)|Instead]]'', together with the song "Anonymous".

=== 2005–present: Recent activity ===
In early 2005, Propaganda, now comprising Susanne Freytag and Michael Mertens, started to release new material on the German independent label Amontillado Music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amontillado-music.com/ |title=Free Music, Mixes, Tour Dates, Photos, Videos |website=Amontillado-music.com |access-date=15 June 2013}}</ref> The 12" vinyl release "Valley of the Machine Gods" was sold out within 2 weeks. In November 2004, the original Propaganda line-up with Brücken and Dörper, but without Thein, performed "Dr. Mabuse" at the [[Wembley Arena]] showcase of Trevor Horn's lifetime celebration.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In July 2010, a 2-disc Deluxe Edition of ''A Secret Wish'', containing the varying tracks released on both the original vinyl album, cassette and CD versions, was released to mark the album's 25th anniversary. This edition also included unreleased 12-inch remixes and previously unheard demos. The booklet accompanying the release noted that "At the time of writing, spring 2010, Mertens, Brücken, Freytag and Dörper are back on terms and for the second time since 2000 they are considering working together."

On 2 March 2011, Claudia Brücken performed at [[Scala (club)|Scala]] in London and was joined by Ralf Dörper and Susanne Freytag for some of the tracks. [[Thomas Leer]] was also expected to perform but was unable to do so because of a throat operation. The gig was recorded for later DVD release and also featured [[Glenn Gregory]] and [[Martyn Ware]] of [[Heaven 17]] and [[Andy Bell (singer)|Andy Bell]] of [[Erasure]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alittlesign.blogspot.com/2011_03_01_archive.html |title=a little sign: March 2011 |website=Alittlesign.blogspot.com |access-date=15 June 2013}}</ref> However, in an interview around the same time, Brücken said that Mertens was unwilling to work with her any longer.<ref name="thequietus.com">{{cite magazine|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/06024-claudia-brucken-interview-combined |title=Features &#124; A Quietus Interview &#124; Breaking Free From The Past: An Interview With Claudia Brucken |magazine=The Quietus |access-date=15 June 2013}}</ref>

Andreas Thein (born 1954) died on 30 May 2013 from cancer.<ref>{{cite web|title=RIP, Andreas Thein (May 30, 2013) Co-Founder Of German Synth Pop Group, Propaganda|url=http://themusicsover.com/2013/05/30/andread-thein/|website=Themusicisover.com|access-date=29 April 2014}}</ref>

A number of their tracks have been resurfaced on ''Art of the 12"'' CDs.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In May 2018 [[Heaven 17]] announced that their tour support would be X-Propaganda featuring Claudia Brucken and Suzanne Freytag. The short tour took place in late November and early December 2018 to mark the 35th anniversary of [[The Luxury Gap]] album.
