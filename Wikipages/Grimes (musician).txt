According to the timestamps on her original [[Myspace]] page,{{Primary source inline|date=October 2021}} Boucher began writing music under the name Grimes in 2007. Her performer name was chosen because at the time, MySpace allowed artists to list three musical genres. She listed "grime" for all three, without knowing what the [[Grime (music genre)|grime music genre]] was.<ref name="seanmichaels">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/22/grimes-admits-moniker-grime-genre-option-myspace|title=Grimes admits lifting moniker from grime genre option on Myspace|first=Sean|last=Michaels|work=The Guardian|date=December 22, 2014|access-date=May 8, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524175427/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/22/grimes-admits-moniker-grime-genre-option-myspace|archive-date=May 24, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://myspace.com/grimesgrime/music/album/lethe-2016469|title=lethe|date=December 18, 2007|access-date=May 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611205916/https://myspace.com/grimesgrime/music/album/lethe-2016469|archive-date=June 11, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Grimes is self-taught in music and visual art.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/grimes-the-triumph-of-a-self-made-oddball-20151105|title=Grimes: The Triumph of a Self-Made Oddball|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=August 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820040853/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/grimes-the-triumph-of-a-self-made-oddball-20151105|archive-date=August 20, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.vogue.com/article/grimes-art-angels-album-hair-color-purple-beauty-makeup-personal-style|title=Grimes On Her New Scene-Stealing Look—And Why Instagram is Killing Her Hair Color Vibe|work=Vogue|access-date=August 23, 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823203901/http://www.vogue.com/article/grimes-art-angels-album-hair-color-purple-beauty-makeup-personal-style|archive-date=August 23, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the past, Boucher has been open about her drug use, stating during the creation of ''[[Visions (Grimes album)|Visions]]'' in 2012, she "blacked out the windows and did tons of [[amphetamine]] and stayed up for three weeks and didn't eat anything".<ref name="Altered Zone" /> In 2011, she and fellow Canadian artist [[D'Eon (musician)|d'Eon]] spent "a week playing shows and doing acid in [[Mexico City]]".

In 2014, Boucher wrote a blog post expressing her aversion to hard drugs, distancing herself from her previous endorsement, saying she does not want {{nobr|"[hard}} drug use] to be part of [her] narrative".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/21303/1/grimes-pens-anti-drugs-note-on-tumblr|title=Grimes pens anti-drugs note on Tumblr|last=Gorton|first=Thomas|date=August 19, 2014|work=[[Dazed & Confused (magazine)|Dazed & Confused]]|access-date=August 23, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821030306/http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/21303/1/grimes-pens-anti-drugs-note-on-tumblr|archive-date=August 21, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1699238/grimes-calls-out-the-trolls-putting-pro-drug-statements-on-her-wikipedia/news/|title=Grimes Calls Out The Trolls Putting Pro-Drug Statements On Her Wikipedia|last=Rettig|first=James|date=August 17, 2014|website=[[Stereogum]]|publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]|access-date=May 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510051307/https://www.stereogum.com/1699238/grimes-calls-out-the-trolls-putting-pro-drug-statements-on-her-wikipedia/news/|archive-date=May 10, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://actuallygrimes.tumblr.com/post/94992916264/losing-people-to-drugs-and-alcohol-is-the-worst|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820134008/http://actuallygrimes.tumblr.com/post/94992916264/losing-people-to-drugs-and-alcohol-is-the-worst|archive-date=August 20, 2014|title=losing people to drugs and alcohol is the worst …|publisher=[[Tumblr]]|date=August 17, 2014|access-date=August 17, 2014}}</ref> "Losing people to drugs and alcohol is the worst because they destroy any good memories you have of them before forcing you to deal with the empty space they leave behind.<ref name=":0" /> I want people to know that I hate hard drugs.
