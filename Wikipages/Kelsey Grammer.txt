===Legal issues===
In 1988, Grammer was arrested for possession of one-quarter gram of cocaine, after being pulled over in a traffic stop for driving with expired plates in [[North Hollywood]]. A year earlier, he had been arrested for a DUI in [[Van Nuys]], and would go on to serve 14 days of a 30-day sentence, as well as 10 days of community service, after failing to comply with the requirements of his parole in 1990.

In 1995, Grammer was accused of sleeping with his child's underage babysitter.
