Born and raised in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], her debut album, ''[[Fearless (Jazmine Sullivan album)|Fearless]]'', was released in 2008 to commercial and critical success. The record topped [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart and was [[RIAA certification|certified gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). It spawned four singles, including "[[Need U Bad]]" and "[[Bust Your Windows]]", both of which peaked in the top 40 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and the former of which became Sullivan's first and only number one on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|''Billboard'' Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart.

Sullivan followed this with her second studio album, ''[[Love Me Back (album)|Love Me Back]]'', in 2010, which was received favorably by critics. After taking a three-year break, Sullivan signed with [[RCA Records]] and released her first studio album under the label, ''[[Reality Show (album)|Reality Show]]'', in 2015, and it became her second album to peak at number one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. In 2021, she released her first EP, ''[[Heaux Tales]]''.

Sullivan has received one [[Billboard Women in Music|''Billboard'' Women in Music]] Award and two [[BET Awards]] over the course of her career.
