==Early life==
Raised in Arizona, Day was immersed in the café and art space her parents helped to create in their small mountain town of [[Pinetop-Lakeside, Arizona|Pinetop-Lakeside]]. She was first encouraged by her mother to learn guitar as practical means for achieving a sustainable career as a musician. Her first songs, written soon after picking up the guitar at age 9, took influence from the classic singer-songwriter records of her parents and the mystique of the rugged desert landscape around her.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/indie-pop-songstress-zella-day-comes-from-a-long-line-of-hardcore-bitches-5627822|title=Indie-Pop Songstress Zella Day Comes From a Long Line of Hardcore Bitches|last=Thomas-Hansard|first=Artemis|date=June 2, 2015|newspaper=[[L.A.
