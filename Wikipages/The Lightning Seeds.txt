'''The Lightning Seeds''' are an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Liverpool]] in 1989 by [[Ian Broudie]] (vocals, guitar, producer), formerly of the bands [[Big in Japan (band)|Big in Japan]], [[Care (band)|Care]], and [[Original Mirrors]].<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4756|pure_url=yes}}| title=Lightning Seeds biography| author=Ankeny, Jason|publisher=allmusic.com|access-date=2 November 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.lightning-seeds.co.uk/biography.htm The Lightning Seeds Biography] Retrieved 20 July 2011</ref> Originally a studio-based solo project for Broudie, the Lightning Seeds expanded into a touring band following ''[[Jollification]]'' (1994). The group experienced commercial success throughout the 1990s and are well known for their single "[[Three Lions]]", a collaboration with [[David Baddiel]] and [[Frank Skinner]] which reached No. 1 in the UK in 1996 and 1998. The single once again reached No. 1 in the UK in 2018.

==History==
===1989–1993: Formation and early years===
Prior to the forming his own project, [[Ian Broudie]] had been a member of the 1970s post-punk band [[Big in Japan (band)|Big in Japan]] and the [[New wave music|new wave]] bands [[Original Mirrors]] and [[Care (band)|Care]].<ref name="heraldscotland.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/music-features/ian-broudie-s-pop-life-was-joy-marvellous-and-perfect-but-then-came-three-lions-1.989143|title=Ian Broudie’s pop life was Joy, Marvellous and Perfect...but then came Three Lions|work=Herald Scotland}}</ref> By the late 1980s, Broudie was better known as a producer than as a musician, and had produced albums for new wave and alternative rock artists such as [[Echo & the Bunnymen]], [[Wall of Voodoo]] and [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]].<ref name="Larkinindie">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who’s Who of Indie and New Wave Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-579-4|page=162}}</ref>

In 1989, Broudie began recording alone under the name "Lightning Seeds".<ref name="Larkinindie"/> The name derives from a misheard lyric from [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s 1985 hit single "[[Raspberry Beret]]", in which Prince sings the line "thunder drowns out what the lightning sees". Broudie performed all vocals and instruments on the band's first album, 1989's ''[[Cloudcuckooland (album)|Cloudcuckooland]]'', which he also produced.<ref name="Larkinindie"/> The Lightning Seeds achieved success with their debut single, the [[Psychedelic music|psychedelic]] hit "[[Pure (The Lightning Seeds song)|Pure]]", which reached the top 20 in the UK,<ref name="Larkinindie"/> and the top 40 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the United States. Both "Pure" and followup single "All I Want" also reached the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] top 10.

Broudie resumed his production career after the success of the first Lightning Seeds album,<ref name="Larkinindie"/> but returned to songwriting in 1991 and moved labels from [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]] to [[Virgin Records|Virgin]]. He then resumed his Lightning Seeds recording career, drafting [[Simon Rogers]] as his studio partner in production, arrangements, and instrumentation. Rogers, who had also helped with programming on the first Lightning Seeds album, would continue as Broudie's in-studio partner throughout the rest of the Lightning Seeds' career.

The album ''[[Sense (The Lightning Seeds album)|Sense]]'' (1992) featured the song "[[The Life of Riley (song)|The Life of Riley]]", written by Broudie for his son, which reached No. 28 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. An instrumental version of the song later became better known as the [[BBC TV]] theme for the ''Goal of the Month'' competition. The album ''Sense'' would mark Broudie's first Lightning Seeds songwriting collaborations with former [[The Specials|Specials]] singer [[Terry Hall (singer)|Terry Hall]].

=== 1994–1998: Touring years ===
Broudie signed the Lightning Seeds to [[Epic Records]], put other projects on hold and embarked on a touring schedule: {{cquote|I'd been wanting to perform live again for some time and this was the first time I found myself talking to somebody at a record company who believed in ''Lightning Seeds''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lightning-seeds.co.uk/biography.htm|title=The works of Ian Broudie| website=Lightning-seeds.co.uk|access-date=2 November 2010}}</ref>}}

By the end of 1993 Broudie had finished the ''[[Jollification]]'' (1994) album, which included contributions from [[Terry Hall (singer)|Terry Hall]], [[Alison Moyet]] and [[Ian McNabb]], the promotional tour began in August 1994 with a consistently changing line up over the years with Broudie the only constant. The tour benefited from the success of the second single from the album "Change", which reached No. 13 in the [[UK Singles Charts]],  becoming the band's second UK top 20 hit. The song was also featured on the soundtrack for the hit movie [[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]. The album ''Jollification'' became a critical success<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lightning-seeds.co.uk/fs_net/written.htm#|title= Lightning Seeds reviews|website=Lightning-seeds.co.uk|access-date=2 November 2010}}</ref> and the singles taken from this album, "Lucky You", "Marvellous" and "Perfect" made noticeable impact. [[Mark Farrow]]'s album cover featured the use of [[computer graphics]] to create an enormous [[strawberry]] and depicting seeds with superimposed human faces.

During this period a number of songs were recorded at a private river barge studio located at [[Eel Pie Studios]], then owned by [[Pete Townshend]] for the fourth studio album ''[[Dizzy Heights]]''.<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web|url=http://www.lightning-seeds.co.uk/biography.htm|title=madasafish|website=Lightning-seeds.co.uk}}</ref> The single "Ready or Not" was released ahead of the album and reached No. 20 in the UK Singles chart.

In 1996 [[The Football Association]] commissioned Broudie to write an England song for the upcoming [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro '96]] football tournament. Broudie agreed on the condition that comedians [[Frank Skinner]] and [[David Baddiel]], who had presented the late-night television show ''[[Fantasy Football League]]'' participated. The resulting song, "[[Three Lions]]", became a No. 1 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and was adopted as a [[football chant]], not only in the UK but also in countries such as Germany, where the single and accompanying video reached No. 16 in their charts.

In 1997 Lightning Seeds headlined the [[Hillsborough disaster|Hillsborough]] Justice Concert, which was held at the [[Anfield|Liverpool Anfield stadium]] to raise fund for the families in their struggle for justice.

During this period the band achieved three more UK Top 20 hits, including a cover version of [[The Turtles]] "[[You Showed Me#The Lightning Seeds version|You Showed Me]]", which became one of their biggest hits. 

1997 gave the Lightning Seeds international exposure with the song "[[You Showed Me#The Lightning Seeds version|You Showed Me]]" included on the Austin Powers Soundtrack.  The release of ''[[Like You Do... Best of The Lightning Seeds|Like You Do...]]'' and a UK promotional tour followed.  In 1998, Broudie reworked and recorded an updated version of their hit football anthem for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup]] in [[France]]. "Three Lions '98", reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart and became the first song to top the charts on two occasions with different sets of lyrics.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/3535665.stm|work=BBC News|title=England's Euro 2004 Song released| date=31 May 2004|access-date=2 November 2010}}</ref> In 1998, ''The Lightning Seeds'' also performed on the Main Stage at both the [[Glastonbury Festival]] and the [[V Festival]] in the UK.

===1999–2005: ''Tilt'' and hiatus===
Their album ''[[Tilt (The Lightning Seeds album)|Tilt]]'' (1999) was dance-oriented and featured collaborations with [[Stephen Jones (Babybird)|Stephen Jones]]. The single "Life's Too Short" was heralded by [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[Chris Moyles]] as "one of the band's strongest singles to date"  and rose to No. 27 in the UK Singles Chart.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.lightning-seeds.co.uk/biography.htm|title=Lightning Seeds biography|website=Lightning-seeds.co.uk|access-date=2 November 2010}}</ref>

===2006–present===
The band's second greatest hits album ''[[The Very Best of the Lightning Seeds]]'' was released on 12 June 2006, followed by the re-release of "Three Lions", which rose to No. 9 in the UK Singles Chart. In 2009 Sony released a new collection of songs under the title ''[[Four Winds (album)|Four Winds]],''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/15/lightning-seeds-four-winds|title=Pop review: Lightning Seeds, Four Winds|first=Michael|last=Hann|date=14 May 2009|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=22 January 2018}}</ref> but the album was never toured. 

In 2014, the songs and career of Ian Broudie were celebrated in a concert held at the Liverpool Philharmonic Hall, featuring the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic orchestra and performances by [[Ian McCulloch (singer)|Ian McCulloch]] ([[Echo And The Bunnymen]]), [[Miles Kane]] ([[The Last Shadow Puppets]]), [[Terry Hall (singer)|Terry Hall]] ([[The Specials]]), James Skelly ([[The Coral]]) and Broudie himself<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/06/music-ian-broudie-review-philharmonic-hall-liverpool-bittersweet-undercurrents|title=The Music of Ian Broudie review – 'bittersweet undercurrents'|first=Dave|last=Simpson|date=6 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=22 January 2018}}</ref> with a band featuring musicians Sean Payne ([[The Zutons]]), Bill Ryder Jones and Nick Power ([[The Coral]]) and Broudie's son, Riley. The event was filmed but is yet to be released.

On 22 August 2014, the Lightning Seeds were joined by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in Liverpool's [[Sefton Park]] for a show in front of 30,000 people, reprising the Philharmonic show without the special guests.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/11/ian-broudie-lightning-seeds-three-lions-world-cup-interview|title=The Lightning Seeds' Ian Broudie: 'People didn't know what was on the England badge before Three Lions'|author=Dave Simpson|work=The Guardian}}</ref>
