==Career==
Nabil Salhy was born in [[Boulogne-Billancourt]], in the western suburbs of Paris, to a [[Moroccan people|Moroccan]] family. When his parents divorced he went to live with his mother in difficult conditions in Hautes Noués in [[Villiers-sur-Marne]], [[Val-de-Marne]] an eastern suburb of Paris, whereas his father stayed in Boulogne-Billancourt. In 1996, he formed the rap and hip hop group '''Dicidens''', a trio including Nessbeal and French-[[Martinique]] rapper Zesau and Korias realizing various maxis in 1999 and 2000 being signed to the independent label Magma that later was known as Paire d'As. He cooperated with the band [[Lunatic (group)|Lunatic]]. Their album ''HLM rezidants'' released in 2004, sold 10,000 copies and was their first chart success reaching number 78 on the [[SNEP]], French albums chart where it stayed for 3 weeks.

Nessbeal was also involved with collective 92I with [[Lunatic (group)|Lunatic]], la Malekal Morte, Sir Doum's etc. He took part in [[Booba]]'s first two releases. Not seeing a great progress of his career in 92I, he left after signing to Nouvelle Donne music label releasing two solo albums ''La mélodie des briques'' in 2006, considered a great example of underground rap followed by the more commercially successful ''Rois sans couronne'' in 2008 that reportedly sold 20,000 copies and in 2009 a mixtape, ''RSC Sessions Perdues''. With his brother Dedy, he declared establishing a fictional label he named Verbal Brolik.

Signed to 7th Magnitude label, in 2010, he released ''NE2S'', produced by [[Skread]] from [[Orelsan]]'s team.<ref name=wlmfr>[http://www.welovemusic.fr/chroniques/chroniques-dalbums/nessbeal-selection-naturelle/ WeLoveMusic.fr: Nessbeal - ''Sélection naturelle''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203124742/http://www.welovemusic.fr/chroniques/chroniques-dalbums/nessbeal-selection-naturelle/ |date=2014-02-03 }} {{in lang|fr}}</ref> The album became his biggest success with many collaborations with [[Orelsan]], [[La Fouine]], Bradley Jones, Isleym and [[Indila]]. With the popularity of the single "À chaque jour suffit sa peine" available online and with big coverage from French radio, ''NE2S'' sold close to 30,000 copies peaking at number 13 in the albums chart. In November 2011 came his fourth album and the second with 7th Magnitude under the title ''Sélection Naturelle'' with collaborations with rapper [[Soprano (rapper)|Soprano]], La Fouine, [[Mister You]], [[Mélissa Nkonda]]. It was also produced by Skread.<ref name=wlmfr/>

He took part with some materials in [[Mister You]]'s album ''MDR Mec de rue 2'' with the track "Mesdames, messieurs". He was involved also with some collective projects like ''[[Street Lourd Hall Stars]]'', Illicite projet and Talents fâchés etc. He also had two "fights" with [[Médine (rapper)|Médine]] and [[Youssoupha]]. After ''Sélection naturelle'', he announced that he was taking a break from rapping,<ref>[http://www.13or-du-hiphop.fr/le-blog/2012/11/12/nessbeal-que-devient-il/ 13 Or du Hip Hop: Nessbeal - Que devient-ils?] {{in lang|fr}}</ref><ref>[http://www.radiokif.be/nessbeal-veut-arreter-le-rap/ RadioKif: Nessbeal veut arrêter le rap] {{in lang|fr}}</ref> but by the end of 2013 announced he was preparing a new release in addition to composing for soundtrack of the film ''La Marche''.
