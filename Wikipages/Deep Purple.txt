Deep Purple have had several line-up changes and an eight-year hiatus (1976–1984). The 1968–1976 line-ups are commonly labelled Mark I, II, III and IV.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ram.org/music/reviews/deep_purple.html|title = Deep Purple reviews|website=Ram.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rock.co.za/files/marki.html|title = Deep Purple Mark I & Mark II|website=Rock.co.za}}</ref> Their second and most commercially successful line-up consisted of [[Ian Gillan]] (vocals) and [[Roger Glover]] (bass), who joined founder members [[Jon Lord]] (keyboards), [[Ian Paice]] (drums) and [[Ritchie Blackmore]] (guitar). This line-up was active from 1969 to 1973 and was revived from 1984 to 1989 and again from 1992 to 1993. The band achieved more modest success in the intervening periods between 1968 and 1969 with the line-up including [[Rod Evans]] (lead vocals) and [[Nick Simper]] (bass, backing vocals), between 1974 and 1976 with the line-up including [[David Coverdale]] (lead vocals) and [[Glenn Hughes (English singer)|Glenn Hughes]] (bass, vocals) (and [[Tommy Bolin]] replacing Blackmore in 1975), and between 1989 and 1992 with the line-up including [[Joe Lynn Turner]] (vocals). The band's line-up (currently including Ian Gillan, and guitarist [[Steve Morse]] from 1994) has been much more stable in recent years, although keyboardist Jon Lord's retirement from the band in 2002 (being succeeded by [[Don Airey]]) left Ian Paice as the last original Deep Purple member still in the band.

==History==
===Beginnings (1967–1968)===
In 1967, former [[The Searchers (band)|Searchers]] drummer [[Chris Curtis]] contacted London businessman Tony Edwards, in the hope he would manage a new group he was putting together, to be called Roundabout. Curtis' vision was a "supergroup" where the band members would get on and off, like a musical roundabout. Impressed with the plan, Edwards agreed to finance the venture with his two business partners [[John Coletta]] and Ron Hire, who comprised Hire-Edwards-Coletta Enterprises (HEC).<ref name="Thompson">{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Dave |author-link=Dave Thompson (author)|year=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LzzCw6xs9roC&pg=PA27 |title=Smoke on the Water: The Deep Purple Story |isbn=9781550226188 |access-date=18 January 2011}}</ref>

The first recruit to the band was classically trained [[Hammond organ]] player [[Jon Lord]], Curtis's flatmate, who had most notably played with [[the Artwoods]] (led by [[Art Wood]], brother of future [[Faces (band)|Faces]] and [[Rolling Stones]] guitarist [[Ronnie Wood]], and including [[Keef Hartley]]).<ref>Eder, Bruce. [http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p15491/biography The Artwoods] Allmusic. Retrieved 12 December 2011</ref> Lord was then performing in a backing band for the vocal group [[The Flower Pot Men (band)|The Flower Pot Men]] (formerly known as [[The Ivy League (band)|the Ivy League]]), along with bassist [[Nick Simper]] and drummer [[Carlo Little]]. (Simper had previously been in [[Johnny Kidd and the Pirates]], and survived the 1966 car crash that killed Kidd.) Lord alerted the two that he had been recruited for the Roundabout project, after which Simper and Little suggested guitarist [[Ritchie Blackmore]], whom Lord had never met.<ref name="darker">{{cite web |url=http://www.nicksimper.com/nick_simper_interview_july83.htm |title=Nick Simper Interview from "Darker than Blue", July 1983 |access-date=15 January 2014 |last=Robinson |first=Simon |date=July 1983 |work=Darker than Blue |publisher=Nick Simper official website}}</ref> Simper had known Blackmore since the early 1960s when his first band, the Renegades, debuted around the same time as one of Blackmore's early bands, the Dominators.<ref>Thompson, Dave (2004). "Smoke on the Water: The Deep Purple Story" p.5. ECW Press</ref>

HEC persuaded Blackmore to travel in from [[Hamburg]] to audition for the new group. He was making a name for himself as a studio session guitarist, and had also been a member of [[The Outlaws (UK band)|the Outlaws]], [[Screaming Lord Sutch]], and [[Neil Christian]], the latter artist prompting Blackmore's move to Germany. Curtis's erratic behaviour and lifestyle, fuelled by his use of [[LSD]], caused him to display a sudden lack of interest in the project he had started, forcing HEC to dismiss him from Roundabout. However, HEC was now intrigued with the possibilities Lord and Blackmore brought and persuaded Ritchie to return from Hamburg a second time. Lord and Blackmore began the recruitment of additional members, retaining Tony Edwards as their manager.<ref name="Curtis">[[Dave Thompson (author)|Thompson, Dave]]. [http://www.allmusic.com/artist/chris-curtis-p67960/biography Chris Curtis Biography] Allmusic.

The initial line-up of Deep Purple started in Cadogan Gardens in South Kensington. 

In March 1968, Lord, Blackmore, Simper and Woodman moved into Deeves Hall, a country house in [[South Mimms]], Hertfordshire.<ref>Dafydd Rees, Luke Crampton (1999). "Rock stars encyclopedia" p.279.

Tagging along with Evans was his band's drummer [[Ian Paice]]. Blackmore had seen an 18-year-old Paice on tour with the Maze in Germany in 1966, and had been impressed by his drumming. The band hastily arranged an audition for Paice, given that Woodman was vocally unhappy with the direction of the band's music.<ref name="darker"/> Both Paice and Evans won their respective jobs, and the line-up was complete.<ref name="autogenerated1983">Welch, Chris. "The Story of Deep Purple." In ''Deep Purple: HM Photo Book'', copyright 1983, Omnibus Press.</ref>

During a brief tour of Denmark and Sweden in April, in which they were still billed as Roundabout, Blackmore suggested a new name: "[[Deep Purple (song)|Deep Purple]]", named after his grandmother's favourite song.<ref name="Curtis"/><ref name="Bloom">{{cite book |author=Jerry Bloom |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FcKcrWE8aWgC&pg=PT163 |title=Black Knight: Ritchie Blackmore |publisher=Omnibus Press 2008 |isbn=9781846097577 |quote=Blackmore has stated; "It was a song my grandmother used to play on the piano."}}</ref> The group had resolved to choose a name after everyone had posted one on a board in rehearsal.

Early in 1969, the band recorded a single called "Emmaretta", named after Emmaretta Marks, then a cast member of the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', whom Evans was trying to seduce.<ref>Thompson, Dave (2004). "Smoke on the Water: The Deep Purple Story" p.324. ECW Press</ref> By March of that year, the band had completed recording for their third album, ''[[Deep Purple (Deep Purple album)|Deep Purple]]''. The album contained strings and woodwind on one track ("April"), showcasing Lord's classical antecedents such as [[Bach]] and [[Rimsky-Korsakov]], and several other influences were in evidence, notably [[Vanilla Fudge]]. (Lord and Blackmore had even claimed the group wanted to be a "Vanilla Fudge clone".)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehighwaystar.com/interviews/blackmore/rb199102xx.html |title=Ritchie Blackmore, Interviews |publisher=Thehighwaystar.com |access-date=7 November 2010}}</ref> This was the last recording by the original line-up.

Deep Purple's North American record label, Tetragrammaton, delayed production of the ''Deep Purple'' album until after the band's 1969 American tour ended. This, as well as lackluster promotion by the nearly broke label, caused the album to sell poorly, finishing well out of the ''Billboard'' Top 100. Soon after the third album's eventual release, Tetragrammaton went out of business, leaving the band with no money and an uncertain future. (Tetragrammaton's assets were assumed by [[Warner Bros. Records]], who would release Deep Purple's records in the US throughout the 1970s.)

During the 1969 American tour, Lord and Blackmore met with Paice to discuss their desire to take the band in a heavier direction. Feeling that Evans and Simper would not fit well with a heavy rock style, both were replaced that summer.<ref>Joel Whitburn (2007). "The Billboard Albums: Includes Every Album That Made the Billboard 200 Chart". p.227. Record Research Inc., 2007</ref> Paice stated, "A change had to come. If they hadn't left, the band would have totally disintegrated." Both Simper and Blackmore noted that Rod Evans already had one foot out of the door. Simper said that Evans had met a girl in [[Hollywood]] and had eyes on being an actor, while Blackmore explained, "Rod just wanted to go to America and live in America."<ref name="Rosen Interview 1">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3-xzGcPwjw Steve Rosen Interview with Ritchie Blackmore, 1974] Retrieved from YouTube "Ritchie Blackmore, Guitar God|Part 1/5" on 14 January 2014.</ref>

In search of a replacement vocalist, Blackmore set his own sights on 19-year-old singer [[Terry Reid]]. Though he found the offer "flattering", Reid was still bound by an exclusive recording contract with his producer [[Mickie Most]] and more interested in his solo career.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/interview-singer-and-guitarist-terry-reid-455709.html |work=The Independent |title=Interview: Singer and guitarist Terry Reid |date=7 March 2007 |access-date=23 June 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502125422/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/interview-singer-and-guitarist-terry-reid-455709.html |archive-date=2 May 2008}}</ref> Blackmore had no other choice but to look elsewhere. The band sought out singer Ian Gillan from [[Episode Six]], a band that had released several singles in the UK without achieving any great commercial success. Six's drummer [[Mick Underwood]] – an old comrade of Blackmore's from his days in [[The Outlaws (band)|the Outlaws]] – introduced the band to Gillan and bassist [[Roger Glover]]. According to Nick Simper, "Gillan would join only with Roger Glover."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockpages.gr/detailspage.aspx?id=4459&type=1&lang=EN |title=Rockpages.gr interview with Nick Simper |last=Anasontzis |first=George |publisher=Rockpages |access-date=25 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140901130712/http://www.rockpages.gr/detailspage.aspx?id=4459&type=1&lang=EN |archive-date=1 September 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> This effectively killed Episode Six, which gave Underwood a persistent feeling of guilt that lasted nearly a decade, until Gillan recruited him for [[Gillan (band)|his new post-Purple band]] in the late 1970s. According to Blackmore, Deep Purple was only interested in Gillan and not Glover, but Roger was retained on the advice of Ian Paice.<ref name="Rosen Interview 1"/>

So I said okay."|source =— Ritchie Blackmore on the hiring of [[Roger Glover]].<ref name="Rosen Interview 1"/>}}

This created the Deep Purple Mark II line-up, whose first release was a [[Roger Greenaway]]-[[Roger Cook (songwriter)|Roger Cook]] tune titled "Hallelujah".<ref name="Hallelujah"/> At the time of its recording, Nick Simper still thought he was in the band and had called John Coletta to inquire about the recording dates for the song. He then found that the song had already been recorded with Glover on bass. The remaining original members of Deep Purple then instructed management to inform Simper that he had been officially replaced.<ref>{{cite news |title=Simper recalls pain of Purple sacking |url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/deep-purple-nick-simper-pain-of-sacking |access-date=21 March 2020 |agency=Louder Sound.com}}</ref> Despite television appearances to promote the "Hallelujah" single in the UK, the song flopped.<ref name="Hallelujah"/> Blackmore had told the British weekly music newspaper ''[[Record Mirror]]'' that the band "need to have a commercial record in Britain", and described the song as "an in-between sort of thing"—a compromise between the type of material the band would normally record, and openly commercial material.<ref name="Hallelujah">Bloom, Jerry (2008). "Black Knight: Ritchie Blackmore" p.128. Omnibus Press, 2008</ref>

The band gained some much-needed publicity in September 1969 with the ''[[Concerto for Group and Orchestra]]'', a three-movement epic composed by Lord as a solo project and performed by the band at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London with the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]], conducted by [[Malcolm Arnold]].<ref name="Miles"/> Alongside ''[[Days of Future Passed]]'' by [[the Moody Blues]] and ''[[Five Bridges]]'' by [[the Nice]], it was one of the first collaborations between a rock band and an orchestra. This live album became their first release with any kind of chart success in the UK.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/ |title=Deep Purple The Official Charts Company |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |access-date=24 December 2011}}</ref> Gillan and Blackmore were less than happy at the band being tagged as "a group who played with orchestras", both feeling that the ''Concerto'' was a distraction that would get in the way of developing their desired hard-rocking style. Lord acknowledged that while the band members were not keen on the project going in, at the end of the performance "you could have put the five smiles together and spanned the Thames." Lord would also write the ''[[Gemini Suite Live|Gemini Suite]]'', another orchestra/group collaboration in the same vein, for the band in late 1970. In 1975, Blackmore stated that he thought the ''Concerto for Group and Orchestra'' wasn't bad but the ''Gemini Suite'' was horrible and very disjointed.<ref>{{cite web |author=Steven Rosen |url=http://guitarinternational.com/2010/09/14/ritchie-blackmore-the-rainbow-interview/ |work=Guitar International |year=1975 |title=Ritchie Blackmore Interview: Deep Purple, Rainbow and Dio |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222064521/http://guitarinternational.com/2010/09/14/ritchie-blackmore-the-rainbow-interview/ |archive-date=22 December 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Roger Glover later claimed Jon Lord had appeared to be the leader of the band in the early years.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Highway Star: Deep Purple's Roger Glover Interviewed |work=The Quietus |date=20 January 2011 |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/05569-deep-purple-interview}}</ref>

Shortly after the orchestral release, Deep Purple began a hectic touring and recording schedule that was to see little respite for the next three years. Their first studio album of this period, released in mid-1970, was ''[[Deep Purple in Rock|In Rock]]'' (a name supported by the album's [[Mount Rushmore]]-inspired cover), which contained the then-concert staples "[[Speed King]]", "Into The Fire" and "[[Child in Time]]". The non-album single "[[Black Night]]", released around the same time, finally put Deep Purple into the UK Top Ten.<ref name="Roberts">Roberts, David (2006). [[British Hit Singles & Albums]]. London: Guinness World Records Limited</ref> The interplay between Blackmore's guitar and Lord's distorted organ, coupled with Gillan's powerful, wide-ranging vocals and the rhythm section of Glover and Paice, now started to take on a unique identity that separated the band from its earlier albums.<ref name="Charlton">Charlton, Katherine (2003).

On the album's development, Blackmore stated: "I got fed up with playing with classical orchestras, and thought, 'well, this is my turn.' Jon was into more classical. I said, 'well you've done that, I'll do rock, and whatever turns out best we'll carry on with.'"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KS3P8AjJCc Steve Rosen Interview with Ritchie Blackmore, 1974] Retrieved from YouTube "Ritchie Blackmore, Guitar God|Part 2/5" on 14 January 2014.</ref> ''In Rock'' performed well, especially in the UK where it reached No. 4, while the "Black Night" single reached No. 2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], and the band performed the song live on the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Top of the Pops]]''.<ref>Jerry Bloom (2007). "Black Knight". p. 139. Music Sales Group.</ref><ref name="OCC"/> In addition to increasing sales in the UK, the band were making a name for themselves as a live act, particularly with regard to the sheer volume of their shows and the improvisational skills of Blackmore and Lord. Said Lord, "We took from jazz, we took from old fashioned rock and roll, we took from the classics. Ritchie and myself...used to swap musical jokes and attacks. He would play something, and I'd have to see if I could match it. That provided a sense of humour, a sense of tension to the band, a sense of, 'what the hell's going to happen next?' The audience didn't know, and nine times out of ten, neither did we!"<ref name="Thompson"/>

A second Mk. II album, the creatively progressive ''[[Fireball (album)|Fireball]]'', was issued in the summer of 1971, reaching number 1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name="OCC">[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/27669/DEEP-PURPLE "Deep Purple: UK Charts"].

Within weeks of ''Fireball''{{'}}s release, the band were already performing songs planned for the next album. One song (which later became "[[Highway Star (song)|Highway Star]]") was performed at the first show of the ''Fireball'' tour, having been written on the bus to a show in Portsmouth, in answer to a journalist's question: "How do you go about writing songs?" On 24 October 1971 during the US leg of the Fireball tour, the band was set to play the [[Auditorium Theatre]] in Chicago when Ian Gillan contracted [[hepatitis]], forcing the band to play without him, with bassist Glover singing the set. After this, the rest of the US dates were canceled and the band flew home.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehighwaystar.com/FAQ/history.html|title=Frequently Asked Questions|website=Thehighwaystar.com|access-date=14 October 2019}}</ref>

In early December 1971, the band travelled to Switzerland to record ''[[Machine Head (album)|Machine Head]]''. The album was due to be recorded at the [[Montreux Casino]] using the [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio]], but a fire during a [[Frank Zappa]] and [[the Mothers of Invention]] concert, caused by a man firing a flare gun into the ceiling, burned down the Casino. This incident famously inspired the song "[[Smoke on the Water]]". The album was later recorded in a corridor at the nearby empty [[Hôtel des Alpes-Grand Hôtel|Grand Hôtel de Territet]], with the exception of the music track to "Smoke on the Water". That was recorded at a vacant theatre called The Pavillon before the band was asked to leave.<ref>{{cite news |title=Deep Purple revient sur le lieu où est né "Smoke on the Water" |url=https://www.tdg.ch/culture/musique/deep-purple-revient-smoke-the-water/story/29995483 |access-date=10 April 2020 |work=Tribune deGeneve}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=How Deep Purple created their best hit 'Smoke on the Water' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/deep-purple-montreux-jazz-festival-lake-geneva-1971-a8418926.html |access-date=10 April 2020 |work=The Independent}}</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/sevenages/events/heavy-metal/deep-purple-release-machine-head/ Deep Purple release 'Machine Head'] BBC.

Continuing from where both previous albums left off, ''Machine Head'' was released in late March 1972 and became one of the band's most famous releases. It was the band's second No. 1 album in the UK while re-establishing them in North America, hitting No. 7 in the US and No. 1 in Canada.<ref name="OCC"/> It included tracks that became live classics, such as "Highway Star", "[[Space Truckin']]", "[[Lazy (Deep Purple song)|Lazy]]" and "Smoke on the Water", for which Deep Purple are most famous.<ref name="Roberts"/><ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/machine-head-r5332/charts-awards Billboard – Machine Head], [[AllMusic]].

[[File:Ian Gillan (1972).jpg|thumb|upright|Gillan on stage in [[Clemson, South Carolina]], 1972]]

In January 1972 the band returned to tour the US once again, then headed over to play Europe before resuming US dates in March. While in America Blackmore contracted hepatitis, and the band attempted one show in [[Flint, Michigan]], without a guitarist before attempting to acquire the services of [[Al Kooper]], who rehearsed with the band before bowing out, suggesting [[Spirit (band)|Spirit]] guitarist [[Randy California]] instead. California played one show with the group, in [[Quebec City]], [[Quebec]] on 6 April, but the rest of this tour was cancelled as well.<ref>[https://www.thehighwaystar.comFAQhistory.html] {{dead link|date=October 2019}}</ref>

The band returned to the US in late May 1972 to undertake their third North America tour (of four total that year). A Japan tour in August of that year led to a double-vinyl live release, ''[[Made in Japan (Deep Purple album)|Made in Japan]]''. Originally intended as a Japan-only record, its worldwide release saw the double LP become an instant hit, reaching platinum status in five countries, including the US. It remains one of rock music's most popular and highest selling live-concert recordings.<ref name="Made in Japan"/>

The classic Deep Purple Mark II line-up continued to work and released the album ''[[Who Do We Think We Are]]'' in 1973. Spawning the hit single "Woman from Tokyo", the album hit No. 4 in the UK charts and No. 15 in the US chart, while achieving gold record status faster than any Deep Purple album released up to that time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/deep%20purple |title=The Official Charts Company – Who Do We Think We Are |date=5 May 2013 |publisher=The Official Charts Company}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/who-do-we-think-we-are-mw0000196958/awards |title=Who Do We Think We Are on ''Billboard'' |publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=26 October 2012}}</ref> But internal tensions and exhaustion were more noticeable than ever.

This lineup's first studio album, released in February 1974 and titled ''[[Burn (Deep Purple album)|Burn]]'', was highly successful, reaching No. 3 in the UK and No. 9 in the US, and was followed by another world tour.<ref name="OCC"/> The [[Burn (Deep Purple song)|title track]], which opens the album and would open most concerts during the Mark III era, was a conscious effort by the band to embrace the progressive rock movement, which was popularised at the time by bands such as [[Yes (band)|Yes]], Emerson, Lake & Palmer, [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and [[Gentle Giant]].

=== Mk IV (1975–1976): ''Come Taste the Band'' and break up ===
Following Blackmore's departure, the group considered disbanding but decided to continue and find another guitarist. [[Clem Clempson]] ([[Colosseum (band)|Colosseum]], [[Humble Pie]]), [[Zal Cleminson]] ([[The Sensational Alex Harvey Band]]), [[Mick Ronson]] ([[The Spiders From Mars]]) and [[Rory Gallagher]] were considered, and the final choice was American [[Tommy Bolin]].<ref>Thompson, Dave (2004). ''Smoke on the Water: The Deep Purple Story'', pp.179–180.</ref> There are at least two versions of the Bolin recruitment story: Coverdale claims to have been the one who suggested auditioning Bolin.<ref>liner notes in the ''Deep Purple'' 4-CD boxed set:</ref> "He walked in, thin as a rake, his hair coloured green, yellow and blue with feathers in it. Slinking along beside him was this stunning Hawaiian girl in a crochet dress with nothing on underneath. He plugged into four [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] 100-watt stacks and...the job was his." But in an interview published by ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in June 1975, Bolin claimed that he came to the audition following a recommendation from Blackmore.<ref>{{cite web |author=Deep Purple Appreciation Society |url=http://www.deep-purple.net/interviews/tommy-bolin.htm |title=1975 Tommy Bolin interview |publisher=Deep-purple.net |date=28 June 1975 |access-date=7 November 2010}}</ref> Bolin had been a member of many late-1960s bands – Denny & The Triumphs, American Standard, and [[Zephyr (band)|Zephyr]], which released three albums from 1969 to 1972. Before he joined Deep Purple, Bolin's best-known recordings had been made as a session musician on [[Billy Cobham]]'s 1973 [[jazz fusion]] album ''[[Spectrum (Billy Cobham album)|Spectrum]]'', and as lead guitarist on two post-[[Joe Walsh]] [[James Gang]] albums: ''[[Bang (James Gang album)|Bang]]'' (1973) and ''[[Miami (James Gang album)|Miami]]'' (1974). He had also played with [[Dr. John]], [[Albert King]], [[the Good Rats]], [[Moxy (band)|Moxy]] and [[Alphonse Mouzon]], and was busy working on his first solo album, ''[[Teaser (Tommy Bolin album)|Teaser]]'', when he accepted the invitation to join Deep Purple.<ref name="Talevski"/>

The resulting album, ''[[Come Taste the Band]]'', was released in October 1975, one month before Bolin's ''Teaser'' album. Despite mixed reviews and middling sales (#19 in the UK and #43 in the US), the collection revitalised the band once again, bringing a new, extreme funk edge to their [[hard rock]] sound.<ref name=bbc>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/g8fd|title=BBC - Music - Review of Deep Purple - Come Taste the Band: 35th Anniversary Edition |first=Greg |last=Moffitt }}</ref> Bolin's influence was crucial, and with encouragement from Hughes and Coverdale, the guitarist developed much of the album's material. Despite Bolin's talents, his personal problems with hard drugs began to surface. During the ''Come Taste the Band'' tour many fans openly booed Bolin's inability to play solos like Ritchie Blackmore, not realising that Bolin was physically hampered by his addiction. At this same time, as he admitted in interviews years later, Hughes was suffering from cocaine addiction.<ref name=MkIV-story>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liGRWQECxZc | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406074106/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liGRWQECxZc| archive-date=2017-04-06|title=Gettin' Tighter: The Story Of Deep Purple Mk.

The Mark II line-up continued, releasing ''[[The House of Blue Light]]'' in 1987, which was followed by a world tour (interrupted after Blackmore broke a finger on stage while trying to catch his guitar after throwing it in the air) and another live album ''[[Nobody's Perfect (Deep Purple album)|Nobody's Perfect]]'' (1988) which was culled from several shows on this tour, but still largely based on the by-now familiar ''Made in Japan'' set-list. In the UK a new version of "Hush" (with Gillan on lead vocals) was released to mark 20 years of the band.

=== Mk V (1989–1992): ''Slaves and Masters'' ===
Gillan was fired in 1989; his relations with Blackmore had again soured, and their musical differences had diverged too far.

=== Second Mk II reunion (1992–1993) & Mk VI (1993–1994): ''The Battle Rages On...'' ===
With the tour complete, Turner was forced out, as Lord, Paice and Glover (and the record company) wanted Gillan back in the fold for the 25th anniversary. Blackmore grudgingly relented, after requesting and eventually receiving 250,000 dollars in his bank account<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockpages.gr/detailspage.aspx?id=1453&type=1&lang=EN |title=Ian Gillan Interview |author=George Anasontzis |work=Rockpages.gr |access-date=22 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022044109/http://www.rockpages.gr/detailspage.aspx?id=1453&type=1&lang=EN |archive-date=22 October 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> and the classic line-up recorded ''[[The Battle Rages On...]]'' in 1993. However, Gillan reworked much of the existing material which had been written with Turner for the album.

He was asked to join permanently, but his commitments to his contract with [[Epic Records]] prevented this.

=== Mk VII (1994–2002): ''Purpendicular'' and ''Abandon'' ===
Morse's arrival revitalised the band creatively, and in 1996 a new album titled ''[[Purpendicular]]'' was released, showing a wide variety of musical styles, though it never made chart success on the Billboard 200 in the US.<ref name="AllMusic.com"/> The Mark VII line-up then released a new live album ''[[Live at The Olympia '96]]'' in 1997. With a revamped set list to tour, Deep Purple enjoyed successful tours throughout the rest of the 1990s, releasing the harder-sounding ''[[Abandon (album)|Abandon]]'' in 1998, and touring with renewed enthusiasm.

In 1999, Lord, with the help of a Dutch fan, who was also a musicologist and composer, [[Marco de Goeij]], painstakingly recreated the ''[[Concerto for Group and Orchestra]]'', the original score having been lost. It was once again performed at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in September 1999, this time with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by Paul Mann.<ref name="Buckley"/> The concert also included songs from each member's solo careers, as well as a short Deep Purple set, and the occasion was commemorated on the 2000 album ''[[In Concert with The London Symphony Orchestra]]''.<ref name=Buckley>Buckley, Peter (2003).

AllMusic. Retrieved 4 November 2012</ref> Much of the next few years was spent on the road touring. The group continued forward until 2002 when founding member Lord (who, along with Paice, was the only member to be in all incarnations of the band) announced his amicable retirement from the band to pursue personal projects (especially orchestral work). Lord left his Hammond organ to his replacement, rock keyboard veteran [[Don Airey]], who had helped Deep Purple out when Lord's knee was injured in 2001.

=== Mk VIII (2002–present): ''Bananas'', ''Rapture of the Deep, Now What?!, Infinite'', ''Whoosh!'' and ''Turning to Crime'' ===
In 2003, Deep Purple released their first studio album in five years (''[[Bananas (album)|Bananas]]'') and began touring in support of the album. [[EMI Records]] refused a contract extension with Deep Purple, possibly because of lower than expected sales. Actually ''In Concert with The London Symphony Orchestra'' sold more than ''Bananas''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rockdetector.com/interviews/artist,2377.sm?id=70 |date=10 November 2005 |author=Garry Sharpe-Young |title=Roger Glover interview |work=[[Rockdetector]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209140852/http://www.rockdetector.com/interviews/artist%2C2377.sm?id=70 |archive-date=9 February 2006 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>
