'''Lucille Bogan''' (born '''Lucile Anderson'''; April 1, 1897{{snd}}August 10, 1948)<ref name="LarkinBlues"/> was an American [[classic female blues]] singer and songwriter, among the first to be recorded. She also recorded under the pseudonym '''Bessie Jackson'''. Music critic [[Ernest Borneman]] noted that Bogan was one of "the big three of the blues", along with [[Ma Rainey]] and [[Bessie Smith]].<ref name="Russell">{{cite book|first=Tony|last=Russell|year=1997|title=The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray|publisher=Carlton Books|location=Dubai|page=94|isbn=1-85868-255-X}}</ref> Many of Bogan's songs have been recorded by later blues and jazz musicians.<ref>Wheeler, Lorna (2004).

Many of her songs were sexually explicit, and she was generally considered to have been a "[[dirty blues]]" musician.<ref name="Russell"/>

==Life and career==
She was born Lucile {{sic}} Anderson, the daughter of Gussie and Wylie Anderson.<ref name="bare1">{{cite book| first1= Bob| last1= Eagle| first2= Eric S.| last2= LeBlanc| year= 2013| title= Blues: A Regional Experience| publisher=Praeger| location= Santa Barbara, California| pages=43–44| isbn=978-0313344237}}</ref>  According to some sources, she was born in [[Amory, Mississippi|Amory]], [[Mississippi]],<ref name="AMG">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p280/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Lucille Bogan: Biography|author=Chadbourne, Eugene|work=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=November 22, 2011}}</ref> but according to her entry in the [[1900 census]] her birthplace was [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]].<ref name="bare1"/><ref name="Russell"/> In 1914, she married Nazareth Lee Bogan, a railwayman, and gave birth to a son, Nazareth Jr., in either 1915 or 1916. She later divorced Bogan and married James Spencer, who was 22 years younger than her.

She first recorded [[vaudeville]] songs for [[Okeh Records]] in New York in 1923, with the pianist Henry Callens.<ref name="AMG"/> Later that year she recorded "Pawn Shop Blues" in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]; this was the first time a black blues singer had been recorded outside New York or Chicago.<ref name=williamson>{{Cite book|author=Williamson, Nigel|title=The Rough Guide to the Blues|year=2007|isbn=978-1-84353-519-5}}</ref> In 1927 she began recording for [[Paramount Records]] in [[Grafton, Wisconsin|Grafton]], [[Wisconsin]], where she recorded her first big success, "Sweet Petunia", which was covered by [[Blind Blake]]. She also recorded for [[Brunswick Records]], backed by [[Tampa Red]].

By 1930 her songs tended to concern drinking and sex, such as "Sloppy Drunk Blues" (covered by [[Leroy Carr]] and others) and "Tricks Ain't Walkin' No More" (later recorded by [[Memphis Minnie]]). She also recorded the original version of "[[Black Angel Blues]]", which (as "Sweet Little Angel") was covered by [[B. B. King]] and many others. With her experience in some of the rowdier [[juke joint]]s of the 1920s, many of Bogan's songs, most of which she wrote herself, have thinly veiled humorous sexual references. The theme of prostitution, in particular, featured prominently in several of her recordings. One of these was "Groceries on the Shelf (Piggly Wiggly)", which was originally written and recorded by [[Charlie "Specks" McFadden]].<ref name="bare">{{cite book| first1= Bob| last1= Eagle| first2= Eric S.| last2= LeBlanc| year= 2013| title= Blues: A Regional Experience| publisher=Praeger| location= Santa Barbara, California| page=134| isbn=978-0313344237}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Yanow, Scott |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/complete-recorded-works-1929-1937-mw0000100574 |title=Charlie McFadden, ''Complete Recorded Works 1929–1937'': Songs, Reviews, Credits |work=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2016-10-30}}</ref> [[Piggly Wiggly]] is the name of a successful American [[supermarket]] chain, operating in the [[Southern United States|South]] and the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], which first opened in 1916.<ref>{{cite news|first=Eric |last=Fleischauer |newspaper=[[The Decatur Daily|Decatur Daily]] |title=2 Decatur Piggly Wigglys to Become Food World Stores |url=http://www.decaturdaily.com/detail/46819.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120729204429/http://www.decaturdaily.com/detail/46819.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 29, 2012 |date=November 3, 2009 |access-date=2016-10-30 }}</ref> Bogan used the self-service notion in her amended lyrics to the song, part of which ran, "My name is Piggly Wiggly and I swear you can help yourself, And you've got to have your greenback, and it don't take nothin' else".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ltxEK8LM8qIC&q=lucille+bogan.+Groceries+on+the+Shelf+%28Piggly+Wiggly%29%22.+lyrics&pg=PA136 |title=The New Encyclopedia of Southern Culture: Foodways|edition= easyread |author=Edge, John T. |page=136 |date= September 2009|isbn=9781458721730|access-date=2016-10-31}}</ref>

In 1933, she returned to New York, and, apparently to conceal her identity, began recording as Bessie Jackson for the [[Banner Records|Banner]] label of [[ARC (record company)|ARC]]. She was usually accompanied on piano by [[Walter Roland]], with whom she recorded over 100 songs between 1933 and 1935, including some of her biggest commercial successes, "Seaboard Blues", "Troubled Mind", and "Superstitious Blues".<ref name="Russell"/> Her other songs include "Stew Meat Blues", "Coffee Grindin' Blues", "[[Georgia Grind|My Georgia Grind]]", "Honeycomb Man", "Mr. Screw Worm in Trouble", and "Bo Hog Blues".

Her final recordings with Roland and [[Josh White]] include two takes of "[[Shave 'Em Dry]]", recorded in New York on Tuesday, March 5, 1935. The unexpurgated alternate take is notorious for its explicit sexual references, a unique record of the lyrics sung in after-hours adult clubs.<ref name=williamson/> According to Keith Briggs' liner notes for [[Document Records]] Complete Recordings, these were recorded either for the fun of the recording engineers, or for "clandestine distribution as a 'Party Record.'" Briggs notes that Bogan seems to be unfamiliar with the lyrics, reading them as she sings them, potentially surprised by them herself.<ref>Liner notes. ''Lucille Bogan (Bessie Jackson) Complete Recordings, Vol. 3, 1934–1935''. Document Records BDCD-6038 (1993).</ref> Another of her songs, "B.D. Woman's Blues", takes the position of a "[[Dyke (slang)#Origins and historical usage|bull dyke]]" ("B.D."), with the lyrics "Comin' a time, B.D. women, they ain't gonna need no men", "They got a head like a sweet angel and they walk just like a natural man" and "They can lay their jive just like a natural man."<ref name="AMG"/>

She appears not to have recorded after 1935. She managed her son's jazz group, Bogan's Birmingham Busters, for a time, before moving to Los Angeles shortly before her death from [[Atherosclerosis|coronary sclerosis]] in 1948.<ref name="LarkinBlues">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Blues]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1995|edition=Second|isbn=0-85112-673-1|page=44}}</ref> She is interred at the Lincoln Memorial Park, in [[Carson, California]].
