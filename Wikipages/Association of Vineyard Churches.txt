The '''Association of Vineyard Churches''', also known as the '''Vineyard Movement''', is a [[neocharismatic]] [[evangelical]] [[Christian denomination]].<ref name=nscotland201>Despite the fact that some might see denominational labels as divisive, the founder of the movement [[John Wimber]] said "The Association of Vineyard Churches – for better or worse – is a denomination." Nigel Scotland ''Charismatics and the New Millennium'' (Guildford: Eagle, 1995).</ref>

The Vineyard Movement is rooted in the [[Charismatic movement|charismatic]] [[Renewal (religion)|renewal]] and historic evangelicalism. Instead of the mainstream charismatic label, however, the movement has preferred the term ''Empowered Evangelicals'' (a term coined by [[Rich Nathan]] and Ken Wilson in their book of the same name) to reflect their roots in traditional evangelicalism as opposed to classical [[Pentecostalism]]. Members also sometimes describe themselves as the "radical middle" between evangelicals and Pentecostals, which is a reference to the book ''The Quest for the Radical Middle,'' a historical survey of the Vineyard by Bill Jackson.

It has been associated with the "[[Signs and Wonders]]" movement,<ref name=nscotland>Nigel Scotland ''Charismatics and the New Millennium'' (Guildford: Eagle, 1995)</ref>{{rp|199}} the [[Toronto blessing]],<ref name=nscotland/>{{rp|222}} the [[Kansas City Prophets]]<ref name=nscotland/>{{rp|160}} and a particular style of [[Christian worship music]].<ref name=nscotland/>{{rp|212}}

The Vineyard operates a publishing house, Vineyard International Publishing.

==History==
The first local church started when Kenn Gulliksen brought together two Bible studies, both meeting at the houses of singer/songwriters: [[Larry Norman]] and [[Chuck Girard]] in 1974.<ref>Randall Herbert Balmer, ''Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism: Revised and expanded edition'', Baylor University Press, USA, 2004, p. 713</ref> In early 1975, thirteen groups met at the [[Beverly Hills]] Women's club.<ref name=radical>{{cite book| last = Jackson| first = Bill| title = The Quest for the Radical Middle| publisher = Vineyard International Publishing| year = 1999| isbn = 0-620-24319-8 }}</ref>{{rp|80}} These Bible studies, and others like them, were attended by many popular actors/actresses and musicians including [[Bob Dylan]].<ref name=radical/>{{rp|81}} Gulliksen's Vineyard had spun off sister churches.

In 1977, [[John Wimber]], an evangelical pastor and teacher on church growth, founded a [[Calvary Chapel]] in [[Yorba Linda, California]].<ref name=official_history>{{cite web|url=http://www.vineyardusa.org/site/about/vineyard-history |title=History & Legacy |website=Vineyardusa.org |access-date=2016-07-25}}</ref> Wimber's teaching on healing and the ministry of the [[Holy Spirit]] led to conflict. In a meeting with Calvary Chapel leaders, it was suggested that Wimber's church stop using the Calvary name and affiliate with Gulliksen's Vineyard movement.<ref name=Roozen136>Jackson, Bill. "A Short History of the Association of Vineyard Churches" in ''Church, Identity, and Change: Theology and Denominational Structures in Unsettled Times''. David A. Roozen and James R. Nieman, Editors. Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 2005. {{ISBN|0-8028-2819-1}}. p. 136.</ref> In 1982, Wimber's church changed its name to the Anaheim Vineyard Christian Fellowship. Gulliksen turned over the churches under his oversight to Wimber, beginning his leadership of the Vineyard movement. Evangelist [[Lonnie Frisbee]] credits Gulliksen as founder of the Vineyard movement.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Frisbee|first1=Lonnie|last2=Sachs|first2=Roger|title=Not By Might Nor By Power|date=2012|publisher=Freedom Publications|location=Santa Maria, CA|isbn=978-0978543310|page=127}}<!--|access-date=2 April 2015--></ref>

Beginning in 1988, Wimber established relationships with prophetic figures such as [[Paul Cain (minister)|Paul Cain]], Bob Jones, and [[Mike Bickle (minister)|Mike Bickle]] who pastored Kansas City Fellowship, an independent church which would come under the Vineyard banner as Metro Vineyard (see [[Kansas City Prophets]]). For a time, these men had considerable influence on Wimber and the Vineyard—according to Jackson, Wimber's son was delivered from drug addiction through a prophetic word from Jones.<ref name=Roozen137>Jackson (2005), p. 137.</ref> However, there were those in the Vineyard who were skeptical, and Wimber himself became disillusioned over the restorationist teaching and failed prophecies of these men. Around 1991, Wimber began to distance himself from the prophetic movement, leading the Vineyard back to a [[church-planting]] direction, while Bickle's church withdrew and dropped the Vineyard label.

The Vineyard Movement suffered a visible leadership vacuum after Wimber's death on November 16, 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vineyardboise.org/news_events/2000/radical_middle.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-09-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503021934/http://www.vineyardboise.org/news_events/2000/radical_middle.htm |archive-date=2006-05-03 }}</ref> However, [[Todd Hunter (bishop)|Todd Hunter]], who served as National Coordinator since February 1994 and as acting Director of the Vineyard at the time of Wimber's death, became the National Director in January 1998 and served in that capacity until he resigned in May 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vineyardusa.org/news/press.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-09-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910061734/http://www.vineyardusa.org/news/press.aspx |archive-date=2006-09-10 }}</ref> After Hunter's resignation, the National Board of Directors named Bert Waggoner of [[Sugar Land, Texas]], as the new National Director. As of 2007, the Association of Vineyard Churches includes over 2400 churches around the world, and this number continues to grow due to a strong priority placed on church-planting within the Vineyard mission.<ref name=official_history />  In October, 2011, Phil Strout was selected by the National Board of Directors to succeed Waggoner as National Director in January 2013.<ref name=strout>{{cite web|url=http://www.vineyardusa.org/site/about-vineyard |title=Vineyard Distinctives |website=Vineyardusa.org |access-date=2016-07-25}}</ref>  He served until October, 2021 when Jay Pathak was installed as the National Director.

==Statistics==
On the union's website, they claim that in 2020 it had 2,400 churches in 95 countries.<ref>Association of Vineyard Churches, [https://vineyardusa.org/about/our-global-family/ Our Global Family], vineyardusa.org, USA, retrieved May 30, 2020</ref>

==Beliefs and practices==
===Doctrinal statements===
For most of the early life of the Vineyard Movement, Vineyard churches had no official statement of faith.  This is not to be interpreted as an absence of a common belief structure; rather, the primary reasons for the absence of such a declaration were:

* the demonstrative teaching of John Wimber, who effectively set the tone and doctrinal beliefs of the movement
* a desire to reflect the "low-key," "low-pressure" environment of the church that encouraged people to "come as you are"
* specifically, de-emphasizing any atmosphere or actions that could be considered overtly dogmatic.

According to text in the official Vineyard Statement of Faith<ref name=statementoffaith>{{cite web|url=http://www.vineyardusa.org/site/files/about/statement-of-faith.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206022856/http://vineyardusa.org/site/files/about/statement-of-faith.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-02-06 |title=Foreword |website=Vineyardusa.org |access-date=2016-07-25 }}</ref> released in 1994, an effort to create a common Statement of Faith had been underway since 1983, but took 10+ years to complete because: "On one hand, we felt obliged to set forth our biblical and historically orthodox beliefs, on the other hand, we wanted to describe the values and priorities that make the Vineyard unique within the context of Evangelicalism."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thevineyardchurch.us/aboutus/sof.htm |title=Welcome to The Vineyard Church |website=Thevineyardchurch.us |access-date=2016-07-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025022921/http://www.thevineyardchurch.us/aboutus/sof.htm |archive-date=2007-10-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===LGBTQ+ position===
In a 2020 letter to local church leaders, Vineyard Canada expressed its position that having a non-heterosexual orientation is itself not sinful, however the church does not allow the officiating of same sex marriages or licensing people in same sex marriages for pastoral ministry. This letter also distinguished gender identity from sexual orientation as its own theological and policy matter that requires further consideration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://scvine.com/wp-content/themes/default/audio/20200205%20National%20Vineyard%20Letter.pdf |title=2020-02-05 National Vineyard Letter |access-date=2020-02-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200220223011/http://scvine.com/wp-content/themes/default/audio/20200205%20National%20Vineyard%20Letter.pdf |archive-date=2020-02-20 }}</ref>

==Controversies==
In 1994, a Vineyard church in [[Toronto]], Canada, was criticized by Christian leaders for promoting physical manifestations of the Holy Spirit, such as laughter, weeping, and shaking.<ref>Joe Maxwell, 
[https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/1994/october24/4tc078.html Is Laughing for the Lord Holy?], christianitytoday.com, USA, October 24, 1994</ref>  Critics, such as [[Hank Hanegraaff]] in his book,  "[[Counterfeit Revival]]", charged the [[Toronto Blessing]] (under Wimber's authority at the time) with promoting [[heresy]] for three main reasons: first, claiming unusual experiences of the [[Holy Spirit]] including physical responses, speaking in tongues, and prophesying; second, claiming that these experiences of spiritual revelation were equal in importance to the Bible; and third, claiming that these experiences were a sign that God was doing "something new."<ref name="ReferenceA">Hanegraaff, Hank ''Counterfeit Revival'' Word Publishing. 1997</ref>  Hanegraaff held that the Toronto Blessing (and thus the Vineyard movement) was denying ''[[sola scriptura]]'' or the “sufficiency of Scripture”, a doctrinal tenet to which the majority of Protestant churches adhere, by suggesting that all believers should come to see what "new thing" God was doing in Toronto.  To cessationist and conservative thinking, this "new thing" felt dangerous and potentially cultist, putting the inerrant word of God on equal footing with the expression of a spiritual gift or, in the Hanegraaff's position, undermining the Bible with false teachings.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>  In 1995, the Toronto church was evicted from Vineyard for losing focus on the Bible.<ref>James A. Beverley,[https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/1996/january8/6t1066.html Vineyard Severs Ties with 'Toronto Blessing' Church], christianitytoday.com, USA, January 8, 1996</ref>
