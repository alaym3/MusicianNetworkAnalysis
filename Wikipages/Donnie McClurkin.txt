== Early life ==
McClurkin was born in [[Chester, South Carolina|Chester]], [[South Carolina]] in the [[United States]] of America. When he was eight years old, his two-year-old brother was hit and killed by a speeding driver. Soon after the loss, McClurkin experienced family turmoil due to the loss of his brother, and shortly thereafter, he was a victim of [[childhood sexual abuse]] at the hands of his great uncle, and years after that by his great uncle's son. Two of his sisters dealt with [[substance abuse]] problems, and that's when  the young McClurkin found solace in his going to a church; and, also through an aunt of his who sang background vocals with [[gospel music]]ian, [[Andraé Crouch]]. By the time that he was a teenager, he had formed the McClurkin Singers, and later he formed another group, the New York Restoration Choir, with recordings from as early as 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wlib.com/pages/318905.php |title=WLIB New York Radio Station |publisher=WLIB |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723225400/http://wlib.com/pages/318905.php |archive-date=July 23, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.malaco.com/Catalog/Gospel/The-New-York-Restoration-Choir/list.php |title=Malaco Gospel |publisher=MalacoRecords |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515233549/http://www.malaco.com/Catalog/Gospel/The-New-York-Restoration-Choir/list.php |archive-date=May 15, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/i-see-a-world-mw0000611138 |title=I See a World: The New York Restoration Choir |website=All Music |access-date=May 3, 2021}}</ref>

== Ministry ==

He was hired, as an associate [[minister of religion|minister]], at [[Winans family|Marvin Winans']] Perfecting Church in [[Detroit, Michigan]], in 1989.<ref name=ebony>{{cite news|title=How Donnie McClurkin Overcame, Sexual Abuse and Leukemia Scare To Become A Gospel Music Star |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_10_56/ai_76770627 |publisher=Ebony |date=August 2001 |author=Jeffers, Glenn |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917030542/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_10_56/ai_76770627/ |archive-date=September 17, 2009 }}</ref>  McClurkin served as an assistant to Winans for over a decade.

In 1991, a sharp pain and swelling, followed by internal bleeding led, he says, to his being diagnosed as having leukemia. The doctor suggested immediate treatment, but McClurkin, who was then 31, decided to take his own advice. "I tell people to believe that God will save you," he says, "[and] I had to turn around and practice the very thing that I preached."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_10_56/ai_76770627/ |title=How Donnie McClurkin Overcame Rape, Sexual Abuse And Leukemia Scare To Become A Gospel Music Star |work=Ebony |date=August 2001 |first=Glenn |last=Jeffers |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917030542/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_10_56/ai_76770627/ |archive-date=September 17, 2009 }}</ref>

He was ordained and sent out by the Winans in 2001 to establish Perfecting Faith Church in [[Freeport, New York]], where he is now Senior Pastor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perfectingfaith.org|title=Official Perfecting Faith Church website |publisher=PFC}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_2_100/ai_75950915 |title=Popular Gospel Singer Donnie McClurkin Ordained As Pastor |work=Jet |date=June 25, 2001 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027171219/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_2_100/ai_75950915 |archive-date=October 27, 2007 }}</ref>

== Music ==

A friendship with a [[Warner Alliance]] executive resulted in his signing to the label for his 1996 self-titled LP, with producers Bill Maxwell, [[Mark Kibble]] of [[Take 6]], Cedric and Victor Caldwell plus [[Andrae Crouch|Andraé Crouch]]. The disc, which featured the perennially popular "Stand," went gold shortly after being publicly lauded by Oprah Winfrey.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_2_103/ai_96238156 |title=Donnie McClurkin: Gospel Music's Hidden Treasure |work=Jet |date=January 6, 2003 |first=Clarence |last=Waldron |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027171224/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_2_103/ai_96238156 |archive-date=October 27, 2007 }}</ref> At the 48th Annual Grammy Awards, he won in the category Traditional Soul Gospel Album, for "Psalms, Hymns & Spiritual Songs".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/Music/02/09/grammys.list/index.html |title=List of Grammy winners |website=CNN |date=February 9, 2006 |access-date=May 3, 2021 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5lSheSN0K?url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/Music/02/09/grammys.list/index.html |archive-date=November 21, 2009}}</ref> McClurkin is best known for his hit songs "Stand" and "We Fall Down" which were played in heavy rotation on both Gospel and Urban radio. His three solo albums have topped the Billboard charts.<ref>{{cite web|url= {{BillboardURLbyName |artist=donnie mcclurkin|chart=all}}| title=Billboard Charts|work=Billboard}}</ref>

Dovetailing off the success of his near double-platinum selling album,"Live in London and More" McClurkin released "Psalms,Hymns and Spiritual Songs" in 2005 and "We All Are One: Live In Detroit" in 2009 which also topped Billboard charts across various musical genres. McClurkin's love for people and desire to share gospel music, globally, is the reason he includes a language medley: Japanese, Russian, Spanish, and Dutch in most live performances.

== Radio and television ==

Tom Versen and Tony Sisti of T&T Creative signed McClurkin to a radio syndication deal with advertising giant Dial-Global and syndicator Gary Bernstein. T&T Creative provided a mobile recording studio in Pastor Donnie's church that he can also take on the road. He is quoted as saying, "As much as I love music and singing, I really love doing radio and the direct feedback I get from my listeners all over the country. I never thought I would be having this much fun doing radio and I could touch and impact so many beautiful people."[19]

In 2009, he also broadcast his own television series, ''Perfecting Your Faith'', on [[cable television]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blackchristiannews.com/news/2009/05/donnie-mcclurkin-launches-weekly-television-broadcast.html |title=Donnie McClurkin Launches Weekly Television Broadcast |publisher=Black Christian News |date=May 13, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517034656/http://blackchristiannews.com/news/2009/05/donnie-mcclurkin-launches-weekly-television-broadcast.html |archive-date=May 17, 2009 }}</ref> His television appearances include ''[[Good Morning America]]'', [[CBS]]’s ''[[The Early Show]]'', ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'', ''[[Girlfriends (U.S. TV series)|Girlfriends]]'' and ''[[The Parkers]]''. He has also been featured in such films as ''[[The Gospel (film)|The Gospel]]'' and ''[[The Fighting Temptations]]''. He played a Single Man or a Church Pastor.

== Personal life ==
McClurkin, in 2002, told a Christian website that, due to sexual abuse and porn, he had struggled with homosexuality. "McClurkin believes he "turned" gay because of childhood molestation and traumatic exposure to pornography, but was able to reverse his orientation through [[Pray the gay away|will and prayer]]."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/religion/2013/08/11/ex-gay-donnie-mcclurkin-fired-mlk-concert|title='Ex-gay' Donnie McClurkin Fired from MLK Concert|last=Broverman|first=Neal|date=August 11, 2013|website=Advocate|language=en|access-date=September 6, 2019}}</ref> He also said that he had rejected that "lifestyle": "I’ve been through this and have experienced God’s power to change my lifestyle.
