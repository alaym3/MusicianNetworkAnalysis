'''Joseph Francis Bruce''' (born April 28, 1972),<ref name="OWW">{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/i/icp.html |title=Insane Clown Posse profile |access-date=2008-09-03 |publisher=Black Pants, Inc }}</ref> known by his [[stage name]] '''Violent J''', is an American [[rapper]], record producer, [[professional wrestler]], and part of the hip hop duo [[Insane Clown Posse]]. He is co-founder of the [[independent record label|record label]] ''[[Psychopathic Records]]'', with fellow ICP rapper [[Shaggy 2 Dope]] (Joseph Utsler) and their former manager, Alex Abbiss. Also along with Utsler, Bruce is the co-founder of the [[professional wrestling promotion]] [[Juggalo Championship Wrestling]].

==Early life==
Joseph Bruce is a native of [[Berkley, Michigan]]. He was the last born of three children. His father, Richard Bruce, stole all of the family's money and left when Bruce was two years old.<ref name="BehindthePaint2">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |author2=Hobey Echlin  |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint|url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |year=2003|edition=2nd |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/n31 2]–16 |chapter=The Butterfly }}</ref> Joe's mother, Linda, was forced to care for him and his siblings, [[Robert Bruce (rapper)|Robert]] and Theresa, off the income she made as a janitor. At age seven, Joe and his brother caught a [[butterfly]], and both were fascinated by the vibrant colors and overall peacefulness of the creature.<ref name="BehindthePaint2"/> They kept the butterfly in a jar overnight, and intended to free it the following morning. When they awoke, the brothers found the butterfly had died, and felt as if they had committed a murder. The brothers made a vow that "one day, [they] will make it to heaven, so that [they] can [...] apologize to that Butterfly face-to-face."<ref name="BehindthePaint2"/> On every Insane Clown Posse album and EP it reads "Dedicated to the Butterfly."

Bruce received all of his clothes from [[rummage sale]]s, and his food from canned food drives held at his own school.<ref name="BehindthePaint20">Fostey, p. 20–33</ref> After moving to [[Oak Park, Michigan|Oak Park]], Bruce met John Utsler, and his little brother [[Shaggy 2 Dope|Joey]].<ref name="BehindthePaint51">Fostey, pgs. 51–61</ref> He also began his gang life by reluctantly getting involved in criminal activity in [[Royal Oak Charter Township, Michigan|Royal Oak Township]].<ref name="BehindthePaint51"/> Along with John and Joey, Bruce got heavily into rap music. In 1989, Bruce, as '''Jagged Joe''', Joseph Utsler, as Kangol Joe, and John Utsler, as Master J, released the single titled ''[[Party at the Top of the Hill]]'' under the name of ''JJ Boys'', but they did not pursue a serious career in music.<ref name="BehindthePaint539">Fostey, p. 539–540</ref>

Bruce [[Dropping out|dropped out of school]] in ninth grade,<ref name="BehindthePaint81">Fostey, p. 81</ref> and moved in with his friend, Rudy, in [[River Rouge, Michigan|River Rouge]].<ref name="BehindthePaint106">Fostey, p. 106–119</ref> There he formed his own gang called Inner City Posse, which would terrorize people with Army-issued [[tear gas]] and steal [[Car audio|car radios]] for money.<ref name="BehindthePaint106"/> One night, Joe's mother, who had just moved to [[Ferndale, Michigan|Ferndale]], had her house attacked by rival gang, Hazel Park Posse (HPP), from [[Hazel Park, Michigan|Hazel Park]].<ref name="BehindthePaint106"/> Fearing for his mother's life, Joe fled to Bonnie Doone, [[North Carolina]], a trailer park town just outside [[Fort Bragg (North Carolina)|Fort Bragg]], where his brother was staying with the [[U.S. Army]].<ref name="BehindthePaint106"/> It was there that Bruce witnessed the open racism which would later emerge as the hate for [[Bigotry|bigots]] referenced in Insane Clown Posse's lyrics.<ref name="BehindthePaint106"/>

At seventeen, Joe returned to Ferndale. He was soon jailed, and the experience convinced him to get away from gang life.<ref name="BehindthePaint121">Fostey, p.121–144</ref> In 1989, after a short career in professional wrestling, Bruce and his friend Dale Miettinen Jr. recorded ''[[Intelligence and Violence]]'' on a [[karaoke]] machine, which marked the debut of Bruce's [[stage name]] '''Violent J'''.<ref name="BehindthePaint121"/> Joe bought his own karaoke machine and, along with Joey and John Utsler,  formed the music group [[Insane Clown Posse#Formation of the group|Inner City Posse]], named after their gang. After the release of the album ''[[Bass-Ment Cuts]]'', the group hired record store owner Alex Abbiss as their manager, and established the [[Psychopathic Records]] record label with him in 1991.<ref name="BehindthePaint121"/>

==Musical career==

===Solo career (1990–present)===
In 1990, Bruce recorded his first solo release, ''Enter the Ghetto Zone'', using two [[Cassette deck|cassette players]]. One played the beat, while the other recorded, and Bruce stuck his head between the two and rapped.<ref name="BehindthePaint121"/> In 2003, Bruce released his second solo release ''[[Wizard of the Hood]]'', which was an extended reference to the [[Wizard of the Hood (song)|Wizard of the Hood songs]] which he recorded on Inner City Posse's ''[[Intelligence and Violence]]'' and ''[[Dog Beats]]'', and Insane Clown Posse's ''[[Carnival of Carnage]]''. In 2009, Bruce released the LP ''[[The Shining (Violent J album)|The Shining]]'', which was initially given away for free at the 2008 [[Gathering of the Juggalos]] before being nationally released.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Insane Clown Posse (Presenters) |title=Gathering 2008 – ICP Seminar |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1696178299931890293&ei=bIeoSKivKYSC4wKzpqQx&q=ICP+Seminar+2008&hl=en |medium=Videotape |access-date=2008-08-17 |time=1:30 }}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media |people=Violent J, as "Fats Pepper" |title=January 2009 – Weekly Freekly Weekly  |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbT1_Ja4qNY |publisher=[[Psychopathic Records]] |access-date=2009-01-27  }}</ref> During ICP's GOTJ 2013 seminar J and Shaggy stated that they were wanting to do solo albums. On December 10, 2015 with the release of "Phantom: X-tra Spooky" EP two flyers were released. One for Shaggy 2 Dope's new solo album titled "F.T.F.O.M.F." said to be released in 2016. The other flyer was for Violent J's new solo album titled "Karma Forest" said to be released in 2016.

===Insane Clown Posse (1989-present)===
{{Main|Insane Clown Posse}}
In late 1991, ''Inner City Posse'' changed their style, look, and name. Bruce recalled a dream of a clown running around in Delray, which became the inspiration for the group's new name: Insane Clown Posse.<ref name="BehindthePaint174">Fostey, p. 174–185</ref> Upon returning home that night, Bruce had a dream in which spirits in a [[traveling carnival]] appeared to him—an image that would become the basis for the [[Dark Carnival (Insane Clown Posse)|Dark Carnival]] mythology detailed in the group's Joker's Cards series.<ref name="BehindthePaint174"/> These stories each offer a specific lesson designed to change the "evil ways" of listeners before "the end consumes us all." Insane Clown Posse has a dedicated following, often referred to by the group as [[Juggalo]]s and Juggalettes.

John Utsler left the group about a month before the release of ''Carnival of Carnage'' and Insane Clown Posse has since been composed of Joseph Bruce and Joseph Utsler, who perform under the respective personas of the murderous, [[Evil clown|wicked clowns]] Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope. The duo performs a style of [[hardcore hip hop]] known as ''[[horrorcore]]'', and is known for its dark, violent lyrics and elaborate live performances. Insane Clown Posse has earned two [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] and five gold albums. According to [[Nielsen SoundScan]], the entire catalog of the group has sold 6.5 million units in the United States and Canada as of April 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/musicNews/idUSN0232707820070402?pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0 |title=Insane Clowns prosper even as album sales wane |access-date=2008-09-24 |publisher=[[Reuters]]/[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=April 2, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

===Golden Goldies (1995)===
Golden Goldies was a comical group whose lyrics focused solely on [[gold]].<ref name="BehindthePaint549">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |author2=Hobey Echlin  |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint|url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |year=2003|edition=2nd |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/n560 549]–550 |chapter=Complete Discography }}</ref> The group consisted of Psychopathic Record's employees and friends; Joseph Bruce ('''Golden Jelly'''), Joseph Utsler (Gold D), Robert Bruce (Golden Gram), Billy Bill (Gold Double B), Alex Abbiss (Gold Rocks), [[Mike E. Clark]] (Gold Digger), [[Legz Diamond|Rich Murrell]] (Golden Warrior), Frank Giammanco (Golden Frank), Keith Jex (Gold Teeth), Josh Silverstein (Rold Gold), Kelly Eubanks (Gold Spud), Dave Fink the East Side G (Golden Toby), and Matt Mackalantie (Gold Spakalantie).<ref name="BehindthePaint549"/> Their only LP, ''Gimme Them Fuckin' Nuggets Bitch, Or I'll Punch Your Fuckin' Face'', was recorded in 1995 in a span of one week, and was not publicly released.<ref name="BehindthePaint549"/> Golden Goldies was a project put together by Insane Clown Posse for entertainment purposes only. To add more humor to the album, each artist was given only five minutes to write their verses, and had only one take to record them, which resulted in some artists messing up their lines, and lyrics containing "some very strange things."<ref name="BehindthePaint549"/> The group held only one live performance, which occurred at the record release party for Insane Clown Posse's [[Riddle Box]].<ref name="BehindthePaint549"/>

===Dark Lotus (1998-2017)===
{{Main|Dark Lotus}}
Formed in 1998, Dark Lotus consisted of Bruce and Utsler of Insane Clown Posse, [[Jamie Spaniolo]] and [[Monoxide Child|Paul Methric]] of [[Twiztid]], and [[Blaze Ya Dead Homie|Chris Rouleau]].<ref name="True">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p507519|pure_url=yes}} |title=Dark Lotus > Biography |access-date=2008-07-14 |last=True |first=Chris |website=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Each member was said to "act as a 'petal' of the lotus,"<ref name="True"/> and it was announced that there would be six members. After switching between two different "sixth members," [[Marz (rapper)|Marz]], and [[Anybody Killa]], Dark Lotus decided to keep the group to only five. On January 19, 2017 via an interview with [[Faygoluvers]], Insane Clown Posse announced that the group disbanded.

===Early career (1983–1986)===
Bruce began wrestling alongside his friends Joseph and John Utsler. The three got involved in [[backyard wrestling]], and created two backyard [[wrestling ring]]s for their made up promotion ''Tag Team Wrestling'', later renamed ''National All-Star Wrestling''.<ref name="BehindthePaint51"/> The trio staged National All-Star Wrestling's first show, ''NAW Wrestling Extravaganza'', in front of friends and family. Among others, the show featured Bruce wrestling under the moniker Darryl "Dropkick" Daniels, and Joey Utsler wrestling as both Rhino, and the [[Lucha libre#Masks|masked]] NAW World Champion White Tiger.<ref name="BehindthePaint51"/> Bruce stopped wrestling after becoming involved in gang life and forming Inner City Posse.

===Independent circuit (1990, 1994–2004)===
After being released from jail in 1990, Bruce decided to get away from gang life and start a career in professional wrestling.<ref name="BehindthePaint121"/> Bruce's friend, Rudy Hill, got him booked in a local wrestling promotion. Rudy had lied to the promoter by telling him that Bruce had been trained at the [[Chris Adams (wrestler)|Chris Adams]] [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|Wrestling School]] in [[Texas]].<ref name="BehindthePaint121"/> At the event, Bruce met [[Rob Van Dam]] and [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]], two other first-timers with whom he became very good friends.<ref name="BehindthePaint121"/> Bruce wrestled as '''Corporal Darryl Daniels''', wearing a [[U.S. Army]] uniform that his brother had sent him while in the [[Gulf War]], and had his first match against "Irish" Mickey Doyle at Azteca Hall in Southwest Detroit.<ref name="BehindthePaint121"/> Training alongside Rob Van Dam, Bruce went on to wrestle for [[Al Snow]], including the event which featured the debut of Van Dam.<ref name="BehindthePaint121"/> After a short run in the business, Joe realized his dislike for the backstage politics, and decided to take up a career in music, taking the name '''Violent J'''.<ref name="BehindthePaint121"/>

Bruce returned to wrestling in the [[independent circuit]] in 1994, under the name '''Hector Hatchet'''.<ref name="VJCareer">{{cite web |url=http://cagematch.de/?id=2&nr=3469&view=matches#matches |title=Matches von Violent J |work=Violent J |publisher=Philip Kreikenbohm | language=de | access-date=2011-04-15}} {{unreliable source?|failed=y|date=October 2013}}</ref> He competed for Midwest Championship Wrestling throughout the next year, wrestling in between recording sessions and touring.<ref name="VJCareer"/> From 1996 to 1998, Bruce was involved in a rivalry with [[Shaggy 2 Dope|Sewer Dwella]] in Insane Championship Wrestling.<ref name="VJCareer"/> He continued to compete in several independent promotions for the next three years, including [[Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South|IWA Mid-South]] and NWA Mid American Wrestling.<ref name="OWW"/><ref name="VJCareer"/>

In 2001, Bruce appeared in [[Xtreme Pro Wrestling]] at ''XPW Rapture'' to aid Utsler. After Bruce suffered a [[Legit (professional wrestling)|real-life]] injury from a sloppy [[Professional wrestling attacks#Clothesline|clothesline]], the duo left the company.<ref name="XPW">{{cite web |url=http://www.socaluncensored.com/columns/steve041603.htm |title=Steve's View #107 |author=Steve |work=columns |access-date=2009-11-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919152834/http://www.socaluncensored.com/columns/steve041603.htm|archive-date=September 19, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> On October 5, 2002, he and Utsler wrestled in [[Ring of Honor]] and defeated Oman Tortuga and Diablo Santiago.<ref name="OWW"/> Bruce was later made a playable character in both [[Eidos Interactive]]'s video games [[Backyard Wrestling: Don't Try This at Home]] and [[Backyard Wrestling 2: There Goes the Neighborhood]] as Violent J. To help promote the games, he competed in a series of matches for Backyard Wrestling in 2003 and 2004.

===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1997)===
In August 1997, Bruce received a telephone call from friends Rob Van Dam and Sabu.<ref name="BehindthePaint336">{{cite book |last=Bruce|first=Joseph |author2=Hobey Echlin  |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint|url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol|url-access=registration|date=August 2003 |edition=2nd |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/336 336–349] |chapter=Calling of the Road }}</ref> They asked if he and Utsler could appear on [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW)'s second [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) program, [[Hardcore Heaven#1997|Hardcore Heaven]]. The duo went to Florida to discuss the ECW program's content with Van Dam, Sabu, and [[Paul Heyman]]. Heyman was pleased that Bruce and Utsler were former wrestlers, which meant that they could surprise the crowd by taking [[Bump (professional wrestling)|bumps]]. Heyman also favored the idea of using Insane Clown Posse, because it was unlikely that anyone knew of the relationship the group had with Van Dam and Sabu.<ref name="BehindthePaint336"/> Heyman presented his idea to Bruce and Utsler, who agreed to participate. Insane Clown Posse opened the ECW program by performing songs and exciting the crowd. Then Van Dam and Sabu, the main [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villains]] at the time, attacked Bruce and Utsler. The top [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]], [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]], came in and saved them by chasing away Van Dam and Sabu with his signature [[Shinai|Singapore cane]].<ref name="BehindthePaint336"/>

===ICP's Strangle-Mania Live (1997)===
Being avid wrestling fans, Bruce and Utsler owned, and were fascinated by, the [[Hardcore wrestling|death match]] wrestling collection ''Outrageously Violent Wrestling from Japan.'' The duo decided to create a compilation of their favorite matches, recording their own sports announcing under the personas named "Handsome" Harley Guestella a.k.a. "Gweedo" (Utsler) and "Diamond Donovan Douglas" a.k.a. "3D" (Bruce).<ref name="BehindthePaint353">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |author2=Hobey Echlin  |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |date=August 2003 |edition=2nd |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/353 353–365] |chapter=Life on the Road }}</ref> The compilation video was released nationwide under the title ''ICP's Strangle-Mania''. The video's success allowed Bruce and Utsler to host their own wrestling show, ''ICP's Strangle-Mania Live'', to a sold-out performance at St. Andrew's Hall. The main event featured Insane Clown Posse versus The Chicken Boys, who were played by two friends of Bruce and Utsler.<ref name="BehindthePaint353"/> With local wrestling [[List of professional wrestling terms#B|booker]] Dan Curtis, other wrestlers such as [[Mad Man Pondo]], [[2 Tuff Tony]], [[Steve Robinson (wrestler)|Corporal Robinson]], [[King Kong Bundy]], and [[Abdullah the Butcher]] were also booked on the show to wrestle in the same death match style as shown in ''ICP Strangle-Mania''.<ref name="BehindthePaint353"/>

In 1998, Insane Clown Posse were asked by the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation (WWF)]] to perform the entrance theme for the wrestling group [[The Oddities (professional wrestling)|The Oddities]].<ref name="BehindthePaint398">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |author2=Hobey Echlin  |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |date=August 2003 |edition=2nd |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/398 398–413] |chapter=Taking Bumps }}</ref> The WWF also wanted Bruce and Utsler to appear on their [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]] pay-per-view (PPV) program in August 1998 and rap live while The Oddities entered the ring. Once the duo arrived at the arena, they realized their wrestling dreams had come true; they had been contacted by wrestling's top company and were now set to appear on their PPV program at the company's most historic venue, [[Madison Square Garden]].<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/> Bruce and Utsler were assigned to the locker room with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and [[The Undertaker]], who were to wrestle during the main event that night. The duo immediately felt the animosity of the locker room that had previously driven them away from wrestling.<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/> Insane Clown Posse performed and was asked to return for the live broadcast of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' the following night. At the broadcast, Bruce and Utsler requested for more than just a rapping role; they wanted to wrestle. [[Vince McMahon|Vincent McMahon]] favored the idea and allowed them to participate.<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/>

Insane Clown Posse was put in a feud with [[The Headbangers]]. In the first wrestling match, The Headbangers were [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|stiff]], throwing real punches and kicks.<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/> In the rematch, a move was planned where The Headbangers would be flipped over by Bruce and Utsler. When the time came to flip over, however, The Headbangers refused to move, forcing Insane Clown Posse to genuinely flip them over and begin throwing punches.<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/> Realizing that the match was getting too heated, McMahon ended the feud after that match.<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/> Bruce and Utsler were put into other matches along with The Oddities. [[Vince Russo]] told Bruce and Utsler to "make it seem like you don't know anything about wrestling, and you guys keep choking and digging into their eyes".<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/> During this time, Bruce and Utsler had no contract with WWF. They, however, did have an agreement that the WWF would occasionally play Insane Clown Posse commercials, and in return, Bruce and Utsler would wrestle for free.<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/> Bruce and Utsler knew that airtime cost significantly more than any monetary compensation they would receive and were thus satisfied with the agreement. The duo were told they were to suddenly [[List of professional wrestling terms#T|turn]] on The Oddities in their match against The Headbangers, then join them in beating up the group. They were also informed that their commercial would air the very next week, which had still not aired after three months of being involved with the WWF.<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/> The next week Insane Clown Posse and The Headbangers had a match with Steve Austin. Backstage, Austin made it clear to Bruce and [[Thrasher (wrestler)|Thrasher]] that Thrasher would receive the first [[Stunner (professional wrestling)|Stone Cold Stunner]], after which Bruce would turn around and receive the second.<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/> During the match, Austin gave Bruce the Stunner first, catching him off guard, thus having Bruce [[Sell (professional wrestling)|sell]] the move awkwardly. Although disappointed over the events during the match, Bruce and Utsler continued in hopes that McMahon would air the commercial as promised. Bruce and Utsler contacted Abbiss to inquire about the commercial and were informed that it was not aired. Given that McMahon failed to uphold his promise to air Insane Clown Posse's commercial, Abbiss recommended that Bruce and Utsler terminate their agreement with the WWF.<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/>

===Hellfire Wrestling (1998)===
While involved with the WWF, Insane Clown Posse brought Dan Curtis with them. After leaving the WWF, Curtis suggested that Insane Clown Posse start its own promotion while continuing with its music. He came to Bruce's house each night to discuss ideas about the promotion. Curtis convinced Bruce to coordinate another ''Strangle-Mania Live'' show, to be followed by an eighty-city "Hellfire Wrestling" tour.<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/> Curtis booked the talent and wrote the scripts. ''Strangle-Mania Live'' sold out the [[Majestic Theater (Detroit, Michigan)|Majestic Theater]] in Detroit.<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/> Two days after the show, Curtis was found dead in his apartment, due to a sudden diabetic problem.<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/> The "Hellfire Wrestling" tour was subsequently canceled.

===World Championship Wrestling (1999–2000)===
Bruce then went on to wrestle a long stint in [[World Championship Wrestling]] with Shaggy 2 Dope. The duo formed two [[List of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stables]]. The first stable, ''The Dead Pool'', consisted of Insane Clown Posse, [[Vampiro]], and [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]]; the second consisted of Insane Clown Posse, Vampiro, [[Keiji Mutoh|Great Muta]], and [[Dale Torborg|Kiss Demon]], known as ''The Dark Carnival''.<ref name="BehindthePaint398"/>

Bruce was jailed for ninety days in 1989–1990 for death threats, robbery, and violating [[probation]];<ref name="BehindthePaint125">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph|author2=Hobey Echlin  |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint|url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/125 125–132] |chapter=Intelligence and Violence|date=August 2003 }}</ref> this experience convinced him to reduce his involvement in gang life.<ref name="BehindthePaint125"/>

On November 16, 1997, Bruce was arrested on an [[aggravated battery]] charge after allegedly striking an audience member thirty times with his [[microphone]] at a concert in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. Bruce was held for four hours before being released on US$5,000 bail.<ref name="MTV-battery">{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430327/19971120/i_c_p.jhtml |title=Insane Clown Charged With Battery |access-date=2008-05-04 |date=November 20, 1997 |publisher=[[MTV]]}}</ref>

After a show in [[Indianapolis]], Insane Clown Posse's tour bus stopped at a [[Waffle House]] in [[Greenfield, Indiana]]. When a customer began to harass Spaniolo and Bruce, a fight broke out between the customer and all of the bands' members.<ref name="BehindthePaint353"/> Months later on June 4, 1998, Bruce and Utsler pleaded guilty to misdemeanor [[disorderly conduct]] charges (reduced from [[battery (crime)|battery]]) in an Indiana court and were fined US$200 each.

On June 15, 2001, Bruce was arrested in [[Columbia, Missouri]] for an outstanding warrant in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] stemming from an incident in February 2001. That incident involved Insane Clown Posse allegedly attacking employees of a St. Louis radio station over disparaging remarks that a [[disc jockey]] made on the air. The police used several squad cars to detain Bruce, Utsler, and two associates a few miles from a venue where the group had completed a concert. Bruce was transferred to St. Louis the following day and released on bail without charge on June 18.<ref name="MTV-StLouis">{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1444587/20010618/i_c_p.jhtml |title=ICP's Violent J Spends Weekend In St. Louis Jail |access-date=2008-05-05 |last=D'Angelo |first=Joe |date=June 18, 2001 |publisher=[[MTV]] }}</ref> On February 6, 2002, Bruce plead guilty to two counts of misdemeanor assault in the second degree and was sentenced to 12 months' unsupervised probation.<ref>{{cite web|title=ICP's Violent J Gets Probation For Fight With St. Louis DJ|author=Joe D'Angelo|date=February 6, 2002|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1452190/icps-violent-j-gets-probation.jhtml}}</ref>
