'''Gustavo Alfredo Santaolalla''' (born 19 August 1951) is an Argentine musician, composer, and record producer. He was known for composing his film scores with his collaborator and acclaimed director [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]], which composed the first four [[psychological drama]] films Iñárritu directed.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Last of Us - Part II - PAN M 360 {{!}} Review|url=https://panm360.com/en/records/the-last-of-us-part-ii/|access-date=2021-11-06|website=PAN M 360|language=en-US}}</ref> He also composed the original scores for the video games ''[[The Last of Us]]'' (2013) and ''[[The Last of Us Part II]]'' (2020), as well as the themes for television series such as ''[[Jane the Virgin]]'' (2014–2019) and ''[[Making a Murderer]]'' (2015–present). He won [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] in two consecutive years, first for ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' (2005) and then ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]'' (2006).

==Early life==
Gustavo Alfredo Santaolalla was born in [[Ciudad Jardín Lomas del Palomar]] on 19 August 1951,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/gustavo_santaolalla|title=Gustavo Santaolalla discography|website=Rateyourmusic.com|access-date=30 September 2016}}</ref> and grew up during the [[Dirty War]].<ref name="On Being with Krista Tippett">{{cite web|url= http://www.onbeing.org/program/gustavo-santaolalla-how-movie-music-moves-us/7591| title= Gustavo Santaolalla - How Movie Music Moves Us | website = On Being with Krista Tippett| access-date= 11 June 2015}}</ref>

==Career==
Santaolalla's music career began in 1967 when he co-founded the group [[Arco Iris (band)|Arco Iris]],<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/15/arts/music/15gus.html|title=Gustavo Santaolalla's Film Scores Are Minimalist and His Tango Is Newfangled|last=Rohter|first=Larry|date=14 August 2008|work=The New York Times|access-date=13 September 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> a rock band that pioneered the fusion of rock and Latin American folk known as ''[[Argentine rock|rock nacional]]''. The band adopted the lifestyle of a yoga commune guided by former model Danais "Dana" Winnycka and her partner, musician Ara Tokatlian. The band had a few hits, such as "Mañanas Campestres" ("Country Mornings"), and made inroads into different forms of musical expression (notably a ballet piece for Oscar Aráiz). However, Santaolalla felt constricted by the strict requirements of Dana's teachings, which prohibited the consumption of meat, alcohol, and drugs; he left the group in 1975.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.viajeroinmovil.com/en/banda/67|title=ARCO IRIS|website=Viajero Inmóvil|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913232031/http://www.viajeroinmovil.com/en/banda/67|archive-date=2017-09-13|url-status=dead|access-date=13 September 2017}}</ref>

In 1976, Santaolalla assembled Soluna, a band in which he played alongside teenage pianist and singer [[Alejandro Lerner]] and his then-girlfriend Monica Campins. Together they recorded just one album (''Energía Natural'' in 1977). He then left for [[Los Angeles]], where he adopted a [[rock and roll]] sound and formed the band Wet Picnic with ex-[[Crucis (band)|Crucis]] member [[Aníbal Kerpel]]. He briefly returned to Argentina in 1981 to produce [[Leon Gieco]]'s ''Pensar en Nada'' and record his first solo album. As a solo artist, he has recorded three albums. His first self-titled album, ''Santaolalla'' (1981), broke new ground by incorporating the 1980s sound into rock in Argentina for the first time. He was joined by Lerner and the Willy Iturry-Alfredo Toth rhythm section, who were two-thirds of the band GIT. His second album, titled ''Gas'', was released in 1995.

Santaolalla's most recent solo album, ''Ronroco'' (1998), contained several tracks with the characteristic sound of the [[Charango|folk string instrument of the same name]], which later became a defining instrument in his soundtrack work. ''Ronroco'' also contains his solo piece for [[Iguazu Falls]], which was later used in films such as ''[[The Insider (film)|The Insider]]'' and ''[[Collateral (film)|Collateral]]'', as well as a 2007 [[Vodafone]] TV commercial and TV series such as ''[[Deadwood (TV)|Deadwood]]'', ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', and ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=TG What's That Song? - [16x03] February 6th 2011|url=https://forums.finalgear.com/top-gear-episode-songs-season-16/16x03-february-6th-2011-a-48136/|access-date=12 March 2017|work=Final Gear|date=29 November 2014}}</ref> It also contains the track "De Ushuaia a La Quiaca" used by [[Walter Salles]] in his ''[[The Motorcycle Diaries (film)|The Motorcycle Diaries]]''. Santaolalla aided the development of [[rock en español]] by acting as producer for the Mexican acts Neón, [[Maldita Vecindad]], [[Fobia]], [[Molotov (band)|Molotov]], [[Café Tacuba]], and [[Julieta Venegas]]; the Colombian singer [[Juanes]]; the Chilean rock trio [[Los Prisioneros]]; fellow Argentine rock musicians [[Divididos]], [[Bersuit Vergarabat]], [[Érica García]], and [[León Gieco]], among many others.

Santaolalla began working on film soundtracks in the late 1990s, producing albums for the films ''[[Amores Perros]]'', ''[[21 Grams]]'', and ''[[The Motorcycle Diaries (film)|The Motorcycle Diaries]]''. He provided the instrumental music for [[Brokeback Mountain (soundtrack)|the soundtrack]] to the 2005 film ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'', from which "[[A Love That Will Never Grow Old]]" won the 2006 [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]]. Santaolalla received the [[78th Academy Awards|2006 Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Original Music Score|Original Music Score]] for ''Brokeback Mountain''.<ref name=":0" /> In 2007, he received his second Academy Award for the [[Babel (soundtrack)|film score]] to  ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]'', and dedicated the award to his father and his home country Argentina.

Santaolalla acted as the producer of [[Gaby Kerpel]]'s ''Carnabailito'' and co-produced the [[Kronos Quartet]]'s ''[[Nuevo (album)|Nuevo]]'', an album which renders homage to the musical heritage of Mexico. He has also been part of the resurgent [[Tango music#Neo-tango|neo-tango]] movement, as the prime mover behind the [[Bajofondo Tango Club]] collective. He is mentioned as the co-producer of [[Calle 13 (band)|Calle 13]]'s song "[[Tango del Pecado]]", a song from their album ''[[Residente o Visitante]]''. In 2005, he received the Platinum [[Konex Award]] as best Argentine artistic producer of the 1995-2005 decade. In 2008, he composed the soundtrack for the [[Louis Vuitton]] film ''Where Will Life Take You?'' directed by [[Bruno Aveillan]]. Later that year, he recorded two songs on "[[All You Need Is Me]]", a single by English singer [[Morrissey]]. The tracks, "Children In Pieces" and "My Dearest Love", were recorded in Los Angeles.

Santaolalla directed music for Aamir Khan's movie [[Dhobi Ghat (film)|''Dhobi Ghat'']], which was released on 21 January 2011. He also collaborated with Argentine composer [[Osvaldo Golijov]] on several projects commissioned by soprano [[Dawn Upshaw]]. These include the opera ''Ainadamar'', based on the murder of Spanish poet [[Federico García Lorca]], and ''Ayre'', a collection of folk songs, in which Santaolalla plays with a group that calls itself The Andalucian Dogs. He provided the score for the 2012 film ''[[On the Road (2012 film)|On the Road]]'', produced by [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and directed by [[Walter Salles]]. That same year, he was nominated for Producer of the Year at the [[Latin Grammy Award]]s for his work on ''De Noche'' (Antonio Carmona), ''Entre la Ciudad y el Mar'' (Gustavo Galindo), and ''Rêverie'' (Luciano Supervielle), co-produced with [[Juan Campodónico]] from [[Bajofondo]].

Santaolalla received critical acclaim for composing the score to the 2013 action-adventure video game ''[[The Last of Us]]'', which was his first experience in the video game industry. In 2020, he returned to compose the music for its sequel, ''[[The Last of Us Part II]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://clips.twitch.tv/playstation/ExpensiveRaccoonOneHand |title=PlayStation® Experience 2016 &#124; Day 1 |publisher=Clips.twitch.tv |access-date=25 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220044248/https://clips.twitch.tv/playstation/ExpensiveRaccoonOneHand |archive-date=20 December 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 2015, Santaolalla was inducted into the [[Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Latin Songwriters Hall Of Fame to Induct Emilio Estefan, Myriam Hernandez, Gustavo Santaolalla, Alvaro Torres, Diego Torres and Hector Ochoa Cardenas at the LA MUSA AWARDS. Presented by WorldArts|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/latin-songwriters-hall-of-fame-to-induct-emilio-estefan-myriam-hernandez-gustavo-santaolalla-alvaro-torres-diego-torres-and-hector-ochoa-cardenas-at-the-la-musa-awards-presented-by-worldarts-300143537.html|access-date=16 October 2015|work=[[PR Newsire]]|date=16 September 2015}}</ref>

On 20 and 21 September 2019, [[Eric Clapton]] invited Santaolalla to participate at his Crossroads event at the [[American Airlines Arena]] in [[Dallas, Texas]]. He performed the song "De Ushuaia a la Quiaca" and a version of "Ando Rodando". He also played in the last song of the event on with Clapton, [[Gary Clark Jr]], [[Buddy Guy]], [[John Mayer]], [[Susan Tedeschi]], [[Derek Trucks]], [[Jimmie Vaughan]], [[James Bay (singer)|James Bay]] and others.

==Artistry==
Santaolalla does not know how to read or write musical notation, nor does he use an orchestra for his soundtracks. He said, "I don't see myself as a film composer. I see myself as more of an artist that uses different forms to express myself. I love it all."<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/gustavo-santaolalla-making-music-for-both-stage-and-screen Gustavo Santaolalla, Making Music For Both Stage and Screen, PBS News Hour, 14 October 2009)]</ref>

==Personal life==
Santaolalla lives in [[Los Angeles]] with his wife, Alejandra Palacios, and their daughter Luna (born 1994) and son Don Juan Nahuel (born 1999). He has a daughter named Ana (born 1980) from a previous relationship with Monica Campins.
