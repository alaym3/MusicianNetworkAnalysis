In February 2015, XYLØ released their debut single, "America", which received attention on [[YouTube]]. The self-released song was promoted through [[Hype Machine]] and [[NoiseTrade]]. The song eventually made it onto the top 10 of the Hype Machine chart and was debuted on American radio through [[KCRW]].

On June 4, XYLØ released their second song, "Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea". Through [[Apple Music]], the duo released their third song, "Afterlife", on July 22, 2015.

The following month, the group announced they were taking a break to focus on producing more material. Shortly afterward, they announced as signees to [[Sony Music Entertainment]].

In 2016, the duo had embarked on a number of their own live shows and released their debut EP, ''America''.

Two days before the extended play's release, they announced their sixth and final single to be released through the EP, entitled "BLK CLD", released February 26, 2016. The EP was released on February 27, 2016 through [[Sony Music Entertainment]].

On June 10, 2016, they released the ''America (The Remixes)'' EP, which includes remixes from [[Young Bombs]] and Win & Woo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://open.spotify.com/album/4odqf3eJ5PwlIj5xhqWvut|title=America (The Remixes) EP|date=10 June 2016|website=Open.spotify.com}}</ref> The group was slated to headline a North American tour with 26 dates across the US and Canada, but the tour was cancelled on August 29, 2017, "due to unforeseen circumstances".

The duo released a new single "Fool's Paradise" on August 5, 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedailylistening.com/listen-xylo-fools-paradise/|title=[LISTEN] XYLØ - "Fool's Paradise"|website=Thedailylistening.com|date=5 August 2016|access-date=20 November 2020}}</ref> The duo was featured on "[[Setting Fires (song)|Setting Fires]]" by [[the Chainsmokers]], released as part of the ''[[Collage (EP)|Collage]]'' EP on November 4, 2016.
