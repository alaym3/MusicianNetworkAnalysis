In his sophomore year, he raised his scoring average to 19.9 points per game and led the Wildcats to the conference championship. At the end of the season, Lillard was named [[Big Sky Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year|Big Sky Player of the Year]] as well as honorable mention [[NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans|All-American]] by the [[Associated Press]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Damian Lillard Named 2009–10 Big Sky MVP|url=http://www.weberstatesports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=99544&SPID=3470&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=8600&ATCLID=204900334|publisher=weberstatesports.com|access-date=December 14, 2011}}</ref>

In [[2010–11 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2010–11]], Lillard led the Big Sky in scoring with 19.7 points per contest before suffering a foot injury ten games into the season that forced him to take a medical [[Redshirt (college sports)|redshirt]] and sidelined him for the rest of the year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lillard gets medical redshirt; Wildcat star's junior season restored|url=http://www.standard.net/topics/sports/2011/06/02/lillard-gets-medical-redshirt-wildcat-stars-junior-season-restored|publisher=standard.net|access-date=December 14, 2011}}</ref>

As a redshirt junior, Lillard averaged 24.5 points and led the nation in scoring throughout most of the year but ended up finishing second to [[Oakland University]]'s [[Reggie Hamilton (basketball)|Reggie Hamilton]]. On December 3, 2011, against [[San Jose State Spartans men's basketball|San Jose State]], Lillard scored a college career-high 41 points, including a game-clinching [[three-point play]] to give Weber State a 91–89 double-overtime win.<ref>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=Weber St. 91, San Jose St. 89|url=https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/recap?gameId=313372692|work=ESPN.com|access-date=October 15, 2020|date=December 3, 2011}}</ref> At the end of the year, he was named to his third first-team all-conference selection and won his second Big Sky Player of the Year award.

Widely regarded as the top point guard prospect in the country, Lillard decided to skip his senior season to enter the [[2012 NBA draft]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.bigskyconf.com/news/2012/4/3/MBB_0403123109.aspx?path=mbball |title=Big Sky Conference – Lillard Declares for NBA Draft |publisher=.bigskyconf.com |access-date=January 1, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027091810/http://www2.bigskyconf.com/news/2012/4/3/MBB_0403123109.aspx?path=mbball |archive-date=October 27, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He finished his college career as the No. 2 scorer in Weber State history (1,934 points) and the No. 5 scorer in [[Big Sky Conference|Big Sky]] history.

Among other distinctions, he broke the all-time NBA rookie record for 3-pointers in a season (185), surpassing [[Stephen Curry]]'s 166 three-pointers in 2009–10; became the Portland franchise leader for most 3-point field goals in a season, breaking [[Damon Stoudamire]]'s record of 181 in 2004–05; and became the first rookie to lead the NBA in total minutes played (3,167) since [[Elvin Hayes]] in 1968–69.<ref name="nbabio"/>

==Music career==
Lillard is a [[hip-hop]] artist and rapper by the name of Dame D.O.L.L.A., which stands for Different On Levels the Lord Allows. He began rapping mainly to hang out in the car of his cousin Eugene "Baby" Vasquez, who moved to Oakland from New York City in the early 1990s. Another big influence on Lillard's rapping was his cousin Brookfield Duece, who had some success in the Oakland rap scene.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

He started a social media trend called "Four [[bar (music)|Bar]] Friday" in which he, and anyone who chooses to participate, submits a video of themselves [[rapping]] a small verse on [[Instagram]] every Friday with the [[hashtag]] #4BarFriday. In July 2015, he released his first full length single, "Soldier in the Game", via the online music streaming site [[SoundCloud]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sportingnews.com/us/other-sports/news/damian-lillard-rap-song-dame-dolla-soldier-in-the-game/mws55p6p3ab71khsy2m9x01v0|title=Damian Lillard aka Dame DOLLA drops new rap song 'Soldier in the Game'|website=www.sportingnews.com|language=en|access-date=April 30, 2019}}</ref> On October 21, 2016, Lillard released his debut album ''[[The Letter O]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2016/10/damian-lillard-new-album-stream-the-letter-o |title=Check Out Damian Lillard's Debut Rap Album 'The Letter O' |publisher=Complex.com |access-date=2020-08-13}}</ref> On October 6, 2017, Lillard released his second album ''[[Confirmed (album)|Confirmed]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2017/10/damian-lillard-dame-dolla-drops-confirmed-album|title=Damian Lillard a.k.a.
