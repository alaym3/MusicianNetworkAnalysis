== Career ==
The Partysquad started producing in the hip hop genre, collaborating with many Dutch rappers. In 2006, they released a hip hop album titled ''De Bazen Van De Club''. The album spawned 6 singles between 2006 and 2007, all of which charted on the Dutch [[Single Top 100]] chart. The song "Rampeneren" with Ali B and Yes-R also peaked at No. 4 on the Dutch Top 40. "Wat Wil Je Doen" was featured on the soundtrack of the 2005 Dutch comedy film [[Schnitzel Paradise|''Het Schnitzelparadijs'']].

Since 2007, the group switched to producing in a wide range of music genres including [[electro house]], [[reggae]], [[Dub music|dub]] and [[Trap music (hip hop)|trap]].<ref name="ps" /> They have performed as opening acts for [[50 Cent]], [[Kanye West]] and [[the Pussycat Dolls]], among others.<ref name="md" />

In 2008, the group went on hiatus, after DJ Jerry had a car accident which left him in coma. As he recovered, the Partysquad made a comeback in 2010, collaborating with [[Afrojack]] for the single "[[A Msterdamn]]".<ref name="ps" /> In 2009, they signed to [[Diplo]]'s record label [[Mad Decent]] and released their first international EP ''Hollertronix #10'' under the label.<ref name="md">{{cite web|title=The Partysquad|url=http://maddecent.com/artists/the-partysquad/|publisher=[[Mad Decent]]|accessdate=2013-08-23}}</ref> Their breakthrough on the U.S. dance scene came with the reggae-influenced collaboration track with [[Major Lazer]] titled "[[Original Don]]". After the success of the song, the Partysquad created a 6-song EP ''Badman Rave EP'', which expanded on the style of "Original Don". The group described their sound as "experimental rave EDM".<ref name="ps" /> The Partysquad created their own label Rebel Yard, as sub-label of [[Spinnin' Records]].<ref name="ps" /> Among the artists signed to the label are DJs and producers [[Armand van Helden]], [[A-Trak]], Boaz, FS Green, [[Major Lazer]] and Yellow Claw, and rappers [[M.I.A.
