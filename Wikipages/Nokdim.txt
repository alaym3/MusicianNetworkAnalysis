==History==
Nokdim was founded on 5 July 1982 by residents of [[Tekoa, Gush Etzion|Tekoa]]. The settlement was originally named ''El-David'' in memory of two residents of Tekoa - Eli Pressman, a [[aliyah|new immigrant]] from [[France]] who was killed in the [[1982 Lebanon War]], and David Rosenfeld, manager of the tourist site at [[Herodium]] who was murdered in July 1982 by two of his [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] employees. The name was rejected by the [[Government Naming Committee]] who suggested the name ''Nokdim'', which was accepted by the settlers.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CG_R01oa780C&pg=PA77| title=Settling in the hearts.

The name is taken from the Bible ({{Bibleverse||Amos|1:1|ESV}}) because of nearby settlement of Tekoa: "...Amos, who was among the ''shepherds'' of Tekoa".<ref>{{cite book| title= (1948–1998) Hamishim shenot hityashvut.

==Land dispute==
A 2006 [[Peace Now]]-report said that up to 30 percent of the land Nokdim is built on is privately owned, all or most of it by Palestinians. According to Israeli law, settlements on privately owned Palestinian land are illegal.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6168752.stm| title=Settlements 'violate Israeli law'| publisher= [[BBC]]| date=21 November 2006| access-date=1 April 2011}}<br />{{cite web| url=https://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,,1953702,00.html| title=39% of Israeli settlements 'on private land'| author=Rory McCarthy| work= [[The Guardian]]| date=22 November 2006| access-date=1 April 2011}}<br />{{cite web| url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/peace-now-40-percent-of-settlements-land-is-owned-by-private-palestinians-1.202005 | title=Peace Now: 40 percent of settlements' land is owned by private Palestinians| author=Nadav Shragai| publisher= [[Ha'aretz]] | date=22 November 2006| access-date=1 April 2011}}<br />
