== Biography ==

=== Formation ===
DJ Robert Abisi (also known as Rob Gainley), was born in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] and Nick Shanholtz (also known as Dr. No) a writer, producer, and multi-instrumentalist, was born in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://wegotthiscovered.com/music/exclusive-interview-lost-kings-signature-sound-originals/|title=Exclusive Interview: Lost Kings Talk Their Signature Sound And Recent Originals|last=Cameron|first=John|date=2015-10-27|newspaper=We Got This Covered|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-01}}</ref> The two met through a mutual friend and started the project when the duo talked about collaborating in music on Abisi's 25th birthday in 2014.<ref name=":3" /> The duo begin using 'Lost Kings' as a stage name because they 'felt lost' moving to Los Angeles and had goals they wanted to accomplish.<ref name=":0" />

=== Members ===

==== Robert Abisi ====
Abisi grew up in [[Andover, Massachusetts]] and initially had dreams to become a professional athlete but was always surrounded by music.<ref name=":3" /> After realizing the ambition was very unlikely to become true, he became a DJ and producer. He was able to meet many of his favorite musical artists, such as [[Coldplay]], at a young age because his father worked in the [[radio industry]]. In school, he started music blogs to introduce people to new music. When he was 19 years old, his parents bought him a DJ controller for Christmas as they realized about his musical passion. The year after that, he found out that his father was diagnosed with [[Throat Cancer|throat cancer]] when he was about to leave for a 'study-abroad' program in [[London]]. Just like that, he was in London, his aunt died due to cancer and his grandmother's husband too died. His father had been cancer-free since December 2009. He graduated from James Madison University in Virginia in 2011 and moved to Los Angeles. He wanted to pursue a musical career as a solo artist and had tried to book DJ gigs.<ref name=":3" />

==== Nick Shanholtz ====
Shanholtz grew up on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]].<ref name=":3" /> He wanted to become a professional musician (specifically, drummer in a band). He started playing the drums when he was 8 years old. He began playing the piano and guitar at 15 and realized he wanted to write and produce music. He went to Patapsco High School and Center for the Arts, and later went to Berklee College of Music in Boston. In 2010, he moved to Los Angeles to enroll in the LA Recording School. Upon arrival in LA, he had struggled to make friends until he met Abisi and surrounded himself with the right people.<ref name=":3" />

== Career ==

=== 2014–15 ===
Lost Kings was launched in 2014 by members Robert Abisi and Nick Shanholtz.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/6778010/lost-kings-remix-success-bad-spinnin-records-ep|title=Lost Kings Talk Remix Success & 'Bad' EP on Spinnin' Records: Exclusive|last=Rishty|first=David|newspaper=Billboard|access-date=2017-02-01}}</ref> They were signed to Disruptor Management, a joint venture by Sony Music and were managed by Adam Alpert and Enes Kolenovic who represented Disruptor Management.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lessthan3.com/news/i-bet-my-life-imagine-dragons-lost-kings-remix|title=I Bet My Life You Dig This Lost Kings Remix|last=Kim|first=David|date=January 31, 2015|website=Lessthan3|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-01}}</ref> They started the project by releasing remixes, in the progressive house genre before shifting to a more 'groove-tinged' sound. The duo sent their first remix to many record companies and received their first response from Alpert of Disruptor Records, prior to their signing to the label. Disruptor agreed with their visions of establishing themselves as artists with remixes before producing original songs. When asked about their diverse musical style, Shanholtz said they didn't want to be only recognized in a particular genre as that would make them 'predictable'. The duo attributed their success to [[Hype Machine]], stating that their music received a lot of plays from the music blog aggregator. They started to gain recognition when their remix of [[Disclosure (band)|Disclosure]]'s "[[Latch (song)|Latch]]" was played on the radio.<ref name=":2" />

They first achieved prominence in 2014 when their unofficial remix of [[Disclosure (band)|Disclosure]]'s "Latch" [feat. [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]]] was placed in regular rotation on [[Sirius/XM Satellite Radio|Sirius/XM]]'s BPM ("Beats Per Minute") Dance/Electronic channel, replacing the original.<ref name=":2" /> ''Billboard'' premiered their official remix of [[Imagine Dragons]]' "[[I Bet My Life]]" (#28 on the US Billboard Hot 100) on January 26, 2015,<ref name=":1" /> noting at the time that "[w]ith 20 native records living on their SoundCloud page, along with a few guest mixes sprinkled in, the Lost Kings’ diligent work ethic in the studio has translated to excellent streaming numbers and a multitude of radio spins.

They released their debut EP "The Bad" through Spinnin' Records.<ref name=":2" />

Their debut on [[Spinnin' Records]], "Bad" (feat. Jessame),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.youredm.com/2015/09/25/lost-kings-release-first-original-track-bad-spinnin/|title=Lost Kings Release First Original Track "Bad" [Spinnin']|last=KSpence|date=2015-09-25|website=Your EDM|access-date=2017-02-01}}</ref> entered Spotify's Global Viral Chart at No. 15 and gained over 4.7 million streams on Spotify and one million video views.

They were tapped to create an official remix of [[Rihanna]]'s ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart-topping "[[Work (Rihanna song)|Work]]" (feat. [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]]).

In October 2016 they signed to Disruptor Records/[[RCA Records]], releasing the single "[[Phone Down]]" (feat. [[Emily Warren (songwriter)|Emily Warren]]) to mark the occasion.
