Mering was heavily involved in the 2020 [[Tim Heidecker]] album ''[[Fear of Death]]'', singing on all twelve tracks, co-writing two and receiving a co-producer credit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timheidecker.bandcamp.com/album/fear-of-death|title = Fear of Death, by Tim Heidecker}}</ref> She received wider attention when she featured (along with [[Zella Day]]) on the closing track of the 2021 [[Lana Del Rey]] album ''[[Chemtrails over the Country Club]]'', a cover of the [[Joni Mitchell]] song "For Free".

==Influences==
Mering has stated that [[church music]], which figured prominently in her upbringing, has been an influence on her songwriting.<ref name=frame/> "Most of the great classical music and early music of our time is written for [[God]] in a sacred space," she said. "So sacred music and sacred space music — that was my favorite thing about music. Not so much content-wise. Not so much the theory and concept of God, but just the idea that we've built this gigantic, stone cathedral palace for people to sing in...When I record, I think about sacred space and I think about what would be the sound of your soul if there is music coming out of it. It would probably be an echoey, strange chamber."<ref name=frame/> In an interview with [[Nardwuar]] in 2019 she revealed that she is also influenced by [[The Velvet Underground]], [[Wolf Eyes]], and experimental artist Inca Ore. Mering states in the same interview that early in her career while making experimental music, people likened her songs to horror film soundtracks. So she began to listen to and be influenced by film soundtracks such as [[Jaws (soundtrack)|Jaws]] and the Wizard of Oz.<ref>{{Citation|title=Nardwuar vs. Weyes Blood|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIstaeDlf2A|language=en|access-date=2019-10-20}}</ref>

Mering is also highly influenced by the late singer songwriter, [[Harry Nilsson]], in both singing style and songwriting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/weyes-blood-album-titanic-rising-843084/|title=Weyes Blood on Stunning New LP, the Titanic Sinking and Climate Change|date=June 14, 2019}}</ref>
