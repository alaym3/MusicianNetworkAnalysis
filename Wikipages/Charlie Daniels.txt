==Politics==
[[File:Charlie Daniels at NavSta Great Lakes.jpg|thumb|upright|Daniels performing at U.S. Naval Station Great Lakes, September 11, 2003]]
Daniels's public politics were varied and idiosyncratic, in his late career trending in a general [[American conservatism|rightward]] progression.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}} His earliest hit, "Uneasy Rider", portrayed him as a country boy in the counterculture movement, caught in an argument with right-wingers at a "redneck" bar. "The South's Gonna Do It Again" had a mild message of Southern cultural identity within the Southern rock movement. Daniels was an early supporter of [[Jimmy Carter]]'s [[President of the United States|presidential]] bid and performed at his January 1977 inauguration.<ref name="Strong">{{cite book |last1=Strong |first1=M.C. |title=The Great Rock Discography |date=1996 |publisher=Canongate Publishing |location=Edinburgh |isbn=0862416043 |page=198}}</ref>
