''' Nothing More '''is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[San Antonio, Texas]]. Formed in 2003, the band spent much of the 2000s recording independent albums and struggling to maintain a steady lineup or attract [[record label]] interest. Towards the end of the decade, the band's long-time drummer, Jonny Hawkins, decided to switch to being the band's [[frontman]] and lead vocalist, stabilizing the band's core lineup along with other long-time members Mark Vollelunga (guitar) and Daniel Oliver (bass). The band self-funded and recorded their fourth studio album, ''[[Nothing More (album)|Nothing More]]'', over the course of three years and used it to gain the attention of [[Eleven Seven Music]] record label, who signed the band to a five album record contract upon hearing it. The album became the band's breakthrough release in 2014, with multiple charting singles, including "[[This is the Time (Ballast)]]", which hit number 1 on the [[Mediabase]] [[Active Rock]] chart and number 2 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]] chart, and "[[Mr. MTV]]", "[[Jenny (Nothing More song)|Jenny]]" and "[[Here's to the Heartache]]" all charting in the top 15 of both charts.

The band began working on a follow-up in 2016 while continuing to tour in support of their self-titled release, and in September 2017, released their fifth studio album - their second on a major record label - ''[[The Stories We Tell Ourselves]]''. The lead single, "[[Go to War]]", outperformed the prior singles, topping the Mainstream Rock chart, and the release earned the band three [[Grammy Award]] nominations; [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]] for the album, and [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song|Best Rock Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance|Best Rock Performance]] for "Go to War". The band continued to promote the release moving into 2018, releasing singles, "[[Do You Really Want It?]]" and "[[Just Say When]]", and embarking on multiple North American tours into 2019.

==History==
=== Formation and early independent releases (2000&ndash;2010) ===
Band member Jonny Hawkins began playing drums as early as the seventh grade, which is around the time he met guitarist Mark Vollelunga, by hearing him play guitar at a church camp. The two became friends, and would hold informal [[jam sessions]] together with other students throughout their middle and high school years.<ref name="LAMusic1">{{cite web|url=http://lamusicblog.com/2013/09/interview/interview-with-jonny-hawkins-of-nothing-more/|title=Interview With Jonny Hawkins Of Nothing More {{!}} LA Music Blog|website=lamusicblog.com|access-date=April 9, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200108045353/http://lamusicblog.com/2013/09/interview/interview-with-jonny-hawkins-of-nothing-more/|archive-date=January 8, 2020}}</ref> In 2003, Hawkins and Vollelunga officially formed the band.<ref name="LoudwireBio">{{cite web|url= http://loudwireawards.com/nothing-more-2017-loudwire-music-awards-performer/|title=Nothing More, 2017 Loudwire Music Awards Performer|website=Loudwire Music Awards|access-date=December 7, 2017}}</ref>

Around the end of high school, the band began recording music and touring locally, which they did for years, plagued by lineup changes and the inability to garner a contract from a [[record label]].<ref name="LAMusic1"/><ref name ="JonnhHawkins2014Int"/><ref name="Hawkins2009">{{cite web|url=http://independentclauses.com/interview-nothing-mores-jonny-hawkins/ |title=Nothing More Interview |website=Independentclauses.com |date=February 21, 2009 |access-date=August 18, 2015}}</ref> In 2004, the band released the more [[funk music|funk]]-influenced album ''Shelter'' with vocalist Josh Klaus, bassist Matt Reynolds, and second guitarist Josh Kercheville.<ref name="Hawkins2009"/><ref name=ShelterBooklet>{{cite AV media notes|title=Shelter |others=Nothing More |year=2004 |type=Booklet |publisher=Nothing More}}</ref> Klaus, followed shortly by Reynolds, were replaced in 2004 by Travis Cox and Daniel Oliver, respectively; they recorded and released the [[extended play|EP]] ''Madhatter's Bliss'' in July 2005.<ref name="Hawkins2009"/><ref name=MadHatBooklet>{{cite AV media notes|title=Madhatter's Bliss |others=Nothing More |year=2005 |type=Booklet |publisher=Nothing More}}</ref><ref name="allmusic.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/madhatters-bliss-mw0000757530|title=Madhatter's Bliss - Nothing More - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=December 7, 2017}}</ref> A compilation album, ''Vandura'', largely consisting of the tracks from the first two releases, was also released in May 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/vandura-mw0001532398|title=Vandura - Nothing More - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=December 7, 2017}}</ref> Cox was later replaced by singer Trey Graham, who had previously toured with [[Kelly Clarkson]].<ref name="Hawkins2009"/> The band found some form of success in the release, releasing the album ''Save You/Save Me'' in 2007 and touring with [[Thirty Seconds to Mars]] and getting on to [[The Warped Tour]], but ultimately felt unhappy with the compromise of moving in a more [[pop music|pop, mainstream]] influence from Graham, and parted ways with the singer. Around the same time, Kercheville left the band as well, leaving the band as a trio.<ref name="Hawkins2009"/>

By mid-2008, the band was at a crossroads. Hawkins began struggling with [[Depression (mood)|depression]], due to a number of personal issues, ranging from his mother's diagnosis, and eventual death, from [[cancer]], the end of a five-year romantic relationship, and stress from turnover in band membership.<ref name="Hawkins2009"/> Additionally, the band had won a "[[battle of the bands]]" contest prior to losing Graham and Kercheville, but collecting the prize money and instruments they had won required them to perform a showcase in front of [[record label]] executives.<ref name="BillboardBio14"/> Feeling a drastic change was in order, Hawkins decided, after over eight years as the band's drummer, to instead become the band's frontman and lead vocalist.<ref name="LAMusic1"/> While the performance, having Hawkins do drums and vocals concurrently, did not go over well, his instinct was that this was the correct direction for the band to pursue ultimately.<ref name="BillboardBio14"/> Despite Hawkins' lack of formal experience in singing, and even general fear of [[public speaking]], he garnered the support of remaining members Vollelunga and Oliver, and the band pushed forward, opting to use fill-in temporary drummers for live performances moving forward.<ref name="LAMusic1"/><ref name="Hawkins2009"/> The members saw this as a new beginning for the band, and later even removed all their previous recordings from any sort of retail space, feeling it no longer represented the band.<ref name ="JonnhHawkins2014Int"/><ref name="Hawkins2009"/><ref name="RockRevolt1">{{cite web|url=http://rockrevoltmagazine.com/nothing-interview/|title=INTERVIEW: NOTHING MORE|date=July 28, 2014|website=Rockrevoltmagazine.com|access-date=December 15, 2017}}</ref>

In 2009, the band released their first album with Hawkins as the lead vocalist, ''[[The Few Not Fleeting]]''.<ref name="LoudwireBio"/> Hawkins largely drew from the aforementioned personal issues for lyrical material on the album, and it largely being created by the core trio, the band was able to delve farther into their preferred music stylings, which the band described as more in the [[progressive rock]], [[alternative rock]], and [[hard rock]] veins than prior releases.<ref name="Hawkins2009"/> The album recorded in Hawkins' home studio, allowing the band to not be constrained by money or time restraints in the studio, which in turn improved the release's overall sound quality as well.<ref name="Hawkins2009"/> The band toured in support of the album for two years.<ref name="NNMag2015">{{cite web|url=http://newnoisemagazine.com/more-interview-guitarist-mark-vollelunga/|title=Nothing More: An Interview with Guitarist Mark Vollelunga - New Noise Magazine|date=February 24, 2015|website=Newnoisemagazine.com|access-date=December 15, 2017}}</ref> While Hawkins performed drums on the album,<ref name="RockRevolt1"/> the band recruited a new drummer, Devin Travieso, who toured in support of the album with the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sacurrent.com/sanantonio/nothing-more/Content?oid=2285543|title=Nothing More|first=Jeremy|last=Martin|website=San Antonio Current|access-date=December 16, 2017}}</ref>

=== Mainstream breakthrough with ''Nothing More'' (2011&ndash;2015) ===
[[File:Nothing More 2014.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.35|Nothing More performing in 2014]]
After the two years of touring in support of ''The Few Not Fleeting'', the band turned to working on recording new music in 2011.<ref name="NNMag2015"/> Still unable to secure a contract from a record label, the band decided to work independently again.<ref name ="JonnhHawkins2014Int"/> Despite this, they set their goal to make a record that sounded as good as a major label release, but on an independent budget.<ref name ="JonnhHawkins2014Int"/> The band recruited new permanent drummer, Paul O'Brien, who reached out to the band after his prior band, Pandemic, broke up.<ref name="LAMusic1"/> Nothing More members, who were familiar with his work with Pandemic, knew he would be a good fit, and hired him after a successful audition.<ref name="RockRevolt1"/> The four proceeded to move in to a house together and worked on the album for three years, writing about the cumulative five years in between the prior and then upcoming album, where they faced many personal hardships they had lived through during the recording process.<ref name="LAMusic1"/><ref name="LoudwireKick">{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/5-questions-nothing-more-jonny-hawkins-daniel-oliver/|title=5 Questions With Nothing More's Jonny Hawkins + Daniel Oliver|website=Loudwire|access-date=December 7, 2017}}</ref><ref name="NNMag2015"/><ref name="RockRevolt1"/> Feeling financial hardships during the time, the band raised money through a successful [[Kickstarter]] campaign.<ref name="LoudwireKick"/> The band had written 60 song ideas, and spent an entire year filtering through the song ideas into 20 songs, and then down to the 17 found on the album's final track list.<ref name="LoudwireKick"/>

The band finished the album, titled it ''[[Nothing More (album)|Nothing More]]'', released it independently in June 2013, and then began touring in support of the album.<ref name="ExpressNews1"/><ref name="BillboardBio14"/> Their big break occurred in September at the 2013 [[Aftershock Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.distortionmag.com/2013/09/18/live-photos-we-as-human-nothing-more-and-otherwise-at-aftershock-festival/|title=Live Photos: We As Human, Nothing More and Otherwise at Aftershock Festival!|date=September 19, 2013|website=Distortionmag.com|access-date=December 7, 2017}}</ref> After a successful show on the first day of the festival, they were asked to come back and perform on the second day, to replace a bigger-named band at one of the show's larger stages.<ref name ="JonnhHawkins2014Int"/> The shows exposed them to a much larger crowd than they usually played - between 10,000 and 13,000 audience members - and after a successful second show, the band finally began getting a number of record label offers.<ref name ="JonnhHawkins2014Int">{{cite web|last1=Shumate|first1=Neal|title=Nothing More Vocalist/percussionist Jonny Hawkins Discusses Striving as an Independent Band by Turning Negative Letdowns and Personal Struggles into Positive Fuel before Being Signed, Religious Background, Breaking Rules in Songwriting, Musical Influences, Future Goals|url=http://www.ootb646.com/interview/nothing-more-jonny-hawkins.html|website=Out Of The Blue|publisher=OOTB Publications|access-date=March 31, 2016}}</ref> In March 2014, the band decided to sign a contract with [[Eleven Seven Music]], not only ending their long-term search for record label support, but securing a five-album deal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/nothing-more-sign-eleven-seven-this-is-the-time-ballast-single/|title=Nothing More Unleash Single 'This Is the Time (Ballast)'|website=Loudwire|access-date=December 7, 2017}}</ref> ''[[Nothing More (album)|Nothing More]]'' was then given a much wider release by the label on June 4, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|author=James Christopher Monger |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/nothing-more-mw0002669653 |title=Nothing More - Nothing More &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=June 23, 2014 |access-date=July 22, 2014}}</ref> This time, the album charted, debuting at number 33 on the [[Billboard 200]] and selling 8,600 copies in its opening week.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/nothing-mores-self-titled-debut-cracks-u-s-top-40/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 22, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808162424/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/nothing-mores-self-titled-debut-cracks-u-s-top-40/ |archive-date=August 8, 2014 }}</ref>

Hawkins' lyrics essay familiar terrain â€“ heartbreak, emotional disaffection â€“ but the likes of 'Do You Really Want It?', with its sober hook 'Everybody wants to change the world / But no one ever wants to change themselves', and lacerating relationship tale 'Go to War' skilfully buck the genre's tendency to adolescent self-pity ... Their attack is ferocious â€“ crashing-airliner [[guitar riff|riffage]], dynamics that rephrase [[Electronic Dance Music|EDM]]'s start-stop rhythms and quiet/loud sonics in metallic tones, and even a very "[[djent]]" instrumental detour ... But Nothing More leaven the melee with [[melody]], often striking a balance between kinetic thrills and keening [[pop music|pop]] [[hook (music)|hooks]] with the skill of a [[Linkin Park]].<ref name="Guardian1207">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/07/nothing-more-review-dingwalls-london-jonny-hawkins|title=Nothing More review â€“ muscular melodies and bare-chested bravado|first=Stevie|last=Chick|date=7 December 2017|access-date=7 December 2017|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref>}}

The band's lyrical content has been inspired by a wide variety of factors. Hawkin's personal life has been a large influence; the single "[[Jenny (Nothing More song)|Jenny]]" is a song that was inspired by his aunt who struggles with schizophrenia and his sister Jenna who struggles with bipolar disorder.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/6516808/nothing-more-jenny-video-premiere-i-know-jenny-initiative|title=Exclusive: Nothing More Premieres Highly Personal 'Jenny' Video|website=billboard.com|access-date=December 7, 2017}}</ref> The band used the song, and respective music video, to help raise awareness and money for [[mental illness]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/nothing-more-mental-illness-awareness-jenny-video-tour/|title=Nothing More Spotlight Mental Illness Awareness in 'Jenny' Clip|website=Loudwire|access-date=December 7, 2017}}</ref> "God Went North" is about the passing of his mother.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://universitypulse.com/blog/2014/11/24/nothing-more-interview/#&gt;|title=Mark & Dan of Nothing More Interview - University Pulse|website=universitypulse.com|language=en-US|access-date=April 8, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019221235/https://universitypulse.com/blog/2014/11/24/nothing-more-interview/#>|archive-date=October 19, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> They have found inspiration from a wide variety of influential writers and philosophers as well, from [[Carl Jung]] to [[C.S. Lewis]].<ref name="BlabDontStop"/> Hawkins explained that "Films have inspired a lot of our songwriting, obviously through the stories but also through how certain directors communicate emotions through visual media, and I think a lot of philosophers like [[Alan Watts]] for instance, who has been a big influence on our lyrics and how we view songwriting altogether which affects how we end up creating all of it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiometal.com/en/article/nothing-more-and-yet-so-many-things-to-say,154237#more-154237|title=Nothing More and yet so many things to say - RADIO METAL|website=RADIO METAL|language=en-US|access-date=April 8, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504131513/http://www.radiometal.com/en/article/nothing-more-and-yet-so-many-things-to-say,154237#more-154237|archive-date=May 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Nothing More has also listed [[Eckhart Tolle]], [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[Terrence Malick]], and [[Dustin Kensrue]] as their influences.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://thehub.musiciansfriend.com/band-month/band-of-the-month-nothing-more|title=Nothing More May Band of the Month The HUB|website=The HUB from Musician's Friend|language=en-GB|access-date=April 8, 2016}}</ref>

[[Mike Wengren]], the drummer of the band [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]], cited Nothing More as one of his favorite newer hard rock bands, citing them as one of the examples against the "rock music is dead" argument.<ref name="blabbermouth.net"/>

==Live performances==
The band is known for its elaborate and energetic live performances, with it being likened to "some sort of twisted, [[rock 'n roll]] adaptation of [[Blue Man Group]] â€” if Blue Man Group ever opened for Rage Against the Machine."<ref name="LAMusic1"/> The band has set up two separate [[drum set]]s for their live show, one for the band's primary drummer Ben Anderson, and one for Hawkins to join in on intermittently, who had previously been a drummer himself in the early years of the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/nothing-more-los-angeles/|title=Nothing More Bring Energy-Packed Show to Los Angeles|website=Loudwire|access-date=December 7, 2017}}</ref> The performances also include a number of contraptions created by the bands themselves, including "The Scorpion Tail" in 2016, an animated structure created out of [[scrap metal]] and salvaged [[auto part]]s, weighing 400 pounds and measuring 14 feet tall.<ref name="BillboardDYRWI"/> Hawkins rides the structure, while also using it to create digital electronic effects for the songs as well.<ref name="BillboardDYRWI"/> Its design is based on the "Drumtron"/"Bassinator" contraption the band has used prior, which also allowed the band to perform 3 person bass solos by Hawkins, Vollelunga, and Oliver.<ref name="BillboardDYRWI"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://kfmx.com/nothing-more-the-scorpion-tail/|title=Jonny Hawkins Discusses New Stage Piece, 'The Scorpion Tail'|website=Kfmx.com|access-date=December 20, 2017}}</ref>
