===Nonsensical Rifle Addiction (2017)===
On 8 October 2017, one week after the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting]], ''Zondag met Lubach'' aired a spoof advertisement called "Nonsensical Rifle Addiction", which highlighted the issue with [[Gun violence in the United States|gun violence]] and [[mass shootings in the United States]], and also lampooned the United States's [[Gun politics in the United States|inability to introduce any binding form of gun control]]. The title is a play on the influential American gun rights organisation [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA). The video was retweeted by American actor [[Samuel L. Jackson]] after the [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting]] in February 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bandt.com.au/campaigns/spoof-ad-lampoons|title=Spoof Ad Lampoons America's 'Nonsensical Rifle Addiction' - B&T|date=11 October 2017}}</ref><ref>[https://www.bustle.com/p/this-dutch-video-about-americas-nonsensical-rifle-addiction-hits-the-nail-on-the-head-2842255 This Dutch video about America's nonsensical rifle addiction hits the nail on the head], bustle.com.</ref>

===Gouden Televizier-Ring (2017)===
====Best Television show====
During the Televizier-Ring Gala on 11 October 2017, ''Zondag met Lubach'' was awarded the Gouden Televizier-Ring (Golden television ring) for "Best television program".<ref name="Nos">{{Cite news |url=https://nos.nl/artikel/2197703-gouden-televizier-ring-voor-zondag-met-lubach.html |title=Gouden Televizier-Ring voor Zondag met Lubach |work=[[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|Nos]] |date=12 October 2017 |access-date=23 October 2017|language=nl}}</ref> Zondag met Lubach got a plurality of the vote with 47%. During the airing of the award show people could vote for one of the three nominees for "Best television program". The two other nominees were [[Beste Zangers]] and [[Expeditie Robinson]]. Arjen Lubach started off his acceptance speech with saying "Wat ontzettend terecht", meaning "How very much deserved" (meant as a joke).<ref name="Nos"/> Furthermore, he praised the rest of his team and acknowledged their importance. This was the first time that a vpro-program won the prize.<ref name="Nrc11">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2017/10/12/lubach-uitgeroepen-tot-populairste-tv-programma-13466235-a1577125 |title=Arjen Lubach wint Gouden Televizier-Ring |work=[[NRC Handelsblad]] |date=12 October 2017 |access-date=23 October 2017|language=nl}}</ref> To get people to vote for ''Zondag met Lubach'' during the show, Arjen Lubach had an advert placed on the [[Ziggo Dome]]. In this advert the presenters of ''Beste zangers'' and ''Expeditie Robinson'' were urging people to vote for ''Zondag met Lubach.'' Lubach later thanked the presenters. This initially angered some people, because they thought that the advert was paid for with tax money. However, Lubach later said that this was not the case, but that he knew a few people who could get this done.<ref name="Televizier">{{Cite news |url=https://www.televizier.nl/categorie/televizier-ring/dit-was-de-ziggo-dome-stunt-van-arjen-lubach.4035197.lynkx |title=Dit was de Ziggo Dome-stunt van Arjen Lubach |work=[[televizier]] |date=13 October 2017 |access-date=23 October 2017|language=nl}}</ref>

====Best actor====
To gain the attention of his viewers about the nomination for best actor, Lubach talked about it on his show, however he didn't talk about his own nomination. Instead, he talked about [[Erik de Vogel]], who got nominated in the category for best actor. He requested people to vote for De Vogel, together with a catchphrase "Ludo verdient een kudo" meaning Ludo (name of the actor's role in [[Goede tijden, slechte tijden]]) deserves kudos.<ref name="YouTube">{{Cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Xa629dwYuA |title=Ludo verdient een kudo - Zondag met Lubach (S07) |work=[[YouTube]] |date=24 September 2017 |access-date=23 October 2017|language=nl}}</ref> De Vogel did however not win the award, as it was given to [[Jeroen van Koningsbrugge]] instead.<ref name="Televizier1">{{Cite news |url=https://www.televizier.nl/categorie/televizier-ring/zilveren-televizier-ster-acteur-voor-jeroen-van.4035074.lynkx |title=Zilveren Televizier-Ster Acteur voor Jeroen van Koningsbrugge |work=[[televizier]] |date=12 October 2017 |access-date=23 October 2017|language=nl}}</ref>
