'''Uverworld''' (stylized as '''UVERworld''') is a Japanese [[Rock music|rock]] band consisting of six members and originating from [[Kusatsu, Shiga]]. "Uverworld" is a term coined by the band members, combining the [[German language|German]] word "über" (meaning "over") with the English word "world" to form a phrase that means "crossing above the world".<ref name="Ro69 profile"/> They have released nine studio albums and over twenty singles and have sold over three million records worldwide. The band's musical style was influenced by 1960s rock bands like [[The Beatles]], [[The Zombies]], and [[The Beach Boys]], and later influenced by [[The Cookies]], [[The Kinks]], and [[The Cramps]]. Vocalist Takuya cited [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[David Bowie]], [[Weezer]], [[Green Day]], and later [[My Chemical Romance]] as influences for the band.

==History==
===2000–2005: Beginnings and debut===
The six-member band known as Uverworld first formed in 2002, and were known as '''Sound Goku Road''', (more popularly known as "Sangoku Road" in the independent music scene).<ref name="Real Sound profile"/><ref name="AllMusic profile"/> The band originally consisted of seven members, and released ''Prime'03'', a [[Demo (music)|demo]] CD which ended up selling 3,000 copies. Unfortunately, two of the band members, the saxophonist Seika, and Ryohei the second-man vocalist left. After Seika's departure, Ace∞Trigger renamed himself '''TAKUYA∞''' and they changed the name to '''UVERworld''' as Akira's idea.

According to an interview with the band, there was another vocalist who left the band. However, this vocalist has not yet been identified. Seika is the only one of the two credited on the demo CD and pictured with very early live photos of the band pre-Uverworld.
