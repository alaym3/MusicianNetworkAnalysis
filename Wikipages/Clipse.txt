'''Clipse''' is an American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] duo, formed by brothers [[No Malice|Gene "No Malice" Thornton]] and [[Pusha T|Terrence "Pusha T" Thornton]] in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]] in 1992. The group was affiliated with the production team [[the Neptunes]], and in 2001 signed to their imprint [[Star Trak Entertainment]].
The duo achieved favorable commercial success, while receiving greater critical acclaim during the 2000s. They are considered pioneers of the [[Mafioso rap]] subgenre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/da/article/6x4pk6/youneedtohearthis-the-evolution-of-clipse|title = The Evolution of Clipse}}</ref>

After forming the duo in 1992, the duo had trouble securing a recording contract. After having their original debut [[Exclusive Audio Footage]] shelved by [[Elektra Records]], the duo was dropped from the label. It would not be until the early 2000s, when Pharrell Williams would sign the duo to [[Arista Records]] through his recently established [[Star Trak Entertainment|Star Trak]] imprint. With the backing of the Neptunes and the record label, the duo released their debut album ''[[Lord Willin']]'' on August 20, 2002. It debuted number 4 on the [[Billboard 200]] and received widely positive reviews from critics. The album was certified [[RIAA]] gold 2 months later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Clipse&ti=Lord+Willin%27#search_section|title=Clipse|publisher=[[RIAA]]}}</ref>

The duo's second album ''[[Hell Hath No Fury (Clipse album)|Hell Hath No Fury]]'' was released in 2006. Despite its modest sales, it received widespread critical acclaim and is considered to be one of the best albums of the 2000s. A third album, ''[[Til the Casket Drops (Clipse album)|Til the Casket Drops]]'', was released in 2009. It is their final project as Clipse, and in 2010 the duo went on hiatus and both members have since pursued solo careers. In 2019, Clipse reunited for the first time in 10 years on Kanye West's song "[[Use This Gospel]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/kanye-west-reunites-clipse-jesus-is-king/|title = Kanye West Reunites Clipse for New Song on Jesus is King Album}}</ref>

==History==

===1993–2000:  Formation and ''Exclusive Audio Footage''===
The Thornton brothers were born in [[The Bronx]], and in 1979 their family moved to [[Virginia Beach]]. It was here the brothers were exposed to the illegal [[Cocaine]] trade, and this would become an essential part of their musical career. Malice started out as a solo act, formed the group Jarvis and was introduced to [[Pharrell Williams]], one half of the production team [[the Neptunes]]. Impressed with his lyrical talents, Williams formed a working relationship with the him. Pusha was just a bystander with his brother, but one day he decided to write a rap and perform. Malice and Pharrell were impressed with his talent, and it was Pharrell who suggested they should become a duo. Thus, the Clipse was born.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Eh-oUMkYM|title=Clipse talk to CNN about their past lives}}</ref> However, in 1992 Malice went to serve in the [[United States Army|Army]] to support his family. This was a hold up in the duo's plans, and it wouldn't be until 1994 when Malice would return from his duties they would eventually start working together. Then, [[Pharrell Williams]] helped them secure a recording contract with [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] in 1996. Under Elektra, and with the Neptunes handling its production, the Clipse recorded its debut album, ''[[Exclusive Audio Footage]]''. The group's 1st single, "The Funeral", helped to generate fan interest in the album, but failed to make a significant chart impact. With "The Funeral" deemed a failure, ''Exclusive Audio Footage'' itself was shelved. The Clipse was released from Elektra shortly thereafter but promotional CDs of the album still exist.<ref>{{cite web | last = Brackett| first = Nathan | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/clipse/articles/story/5938804/new_faces_the_clipse | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071114072658/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/clipse/articles/story/5938804/new_faces_the_clipse | url-status = dead | archive-date = November 14, 2007 | title = New Faces: The Clipse | work = Rolling Stone| access-date = July 31, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mtv.com/news/1454978/lord-willinthe-clipses-time-has-come/|title=LORD WILLIN',THE CLIPSE'S TIME HAS COME|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|date=June 3, 2002|access-date=July 31, 2008}}</ref>

===2001–2002: Breakthrough and ''Lord Willin'''===
In early 2001, Williams signed the duo to [[Arista Records]] through his recently established [[Star Trak Entertainment|Star Trak]] imprint. With the backing of the record label and the Neptune's, Clipse proceeded to record material for their debut album. The lead single "[[Grindin']]" was dropped on May 14, 2002 and was an instant hit. It peaked at number 30 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The song would later go on to become Clipse's most famous song, and many publications would go on to rank the single highly on their year end lists. The second single "[[When the Last Time]]", was dropped on July 30. It would become the group's highest charting song, peaking at number 19 on the Billboard Hot 100, and staying on the chart for 21 weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/clipse/chart-history/HSI/song/415497|title=Clipse |work=Billboard}}</ref> Clipse then released its commercial debut ''[[Lord Willin']]'' on August 20, 2002. The album opened at Number 1 on Billboard's [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart and Number 4 on the [[Billboard 200]], selling 122,000 in its first week.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/74394/eminem-gets-on-with-the-show-at-no-1 |title=Eminem Gets On With The 'Show' At No. 1 |work=Billboard}}</ref> On October 1, 2002—a month after its release—''[[Lord Willin']]'' was certified Gold by the [[RIAA]].<ref name="Reference 1">{{cite web|url=http://allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=1239 |title=Clipse Strike Gold, Neptunes Want To Go Country |last=Kalev |first=Dorit |date=October 9, 2002 |format=Online news article |work=AllHipHop.com |access-date=June 11, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506010520/http://www.allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=1239 |archive-date=May 6, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A third single, "[[Ma, I Don't Love Her]]" featuring [[Faith Evans]] was released on December 3, 2002. It was a modest hit, peaking at number 86 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]], staying on the chart for 6 weeks.
Clipse made another dent in the rap music world that year by providing rhymes for [[Justin Timberlake]]'s first solo single, "[[Like I Love You]]," another Neptunes-produced crossover radio hit. It peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100. Clipse also featured on the song "What Happened to That Boy" with [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]]. Pusha T featured in singer [[Nivea (singer)|Nivea's]] 2nd single [[Run Away (I Wanna Be with U)]] which peaked at #47 in Australia. In 2003, Clipse went on tour with rapper [[50 Cent]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20030313005395/en/Clipse-WILLIN-Tour-50-Cent-%21%21|title= Clipse is WILLIN' to Tour with 50 Cent !!}}</ref>

===2003–2006: Label dispute and ''Hell Hath No Fury''===
In late 2003, Clipse began recording material for their second album, ''[[Hell Hath No Fury (Clipse album)|Hell Hath No Fury]]''. However, further work on the album ground to a halt in 2004, when [[Arista Records]]'s urban artists were absorbed by its sister label [[Jive Records]] as part of a larger merger between [[Sony Music Entertainment]] and [[Sony BMG|BMG]]. Due to contractual requirements, Clipse was forced to stay on Jive, while Star Trak and the rest of its roster moved to a new home at [[Interscope Records]].
[[File:Re-Up Gang.jpg|thumb|[[Pusha T]] and [[No Malice]] of Clipse performing with Ab-Liva from the [[Re-Up Gang]].]]

While Clipse resumed work on the album, and eventually finished its recording, the duo became increasingly frustrated with Jive, as the label overlooked it in favor of the more [[pop (music)|pop]]-oriented acts on its roster, which caused numerous delays in the release of ''Hell Hath No Fury''. As delays continued, the group asked for a formal release from its contract. When Jive refused to grant this request, the duo sued the label. While the litigation took place, Clipse released new material through their legendary ''[[We Got It 4 Cheap]]'' mixtape series, which featured Clipse and [[Philadelphia]] rappers Ab-Liva and Sandman. The group was known collectively as the [[Re-Up Gang]]. ''We Got it 4 Cheap Vol. 1'', which was the first official collection of new material from Clipse since the release of their debut album Lord Willin', was released in 2004 and received positive reviews from critics.  Vol. 2 of the series was released in 2005 received widespread critical acclaim. It is considered to be one of the best mixtape of the 2000s. Online music magazine [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] placed the tape at number 130 on their list of top 200 albums of the 2000s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7707-the-top-200-albums-of-the-2000s-150-101/3/|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|first=Jayson|last=Greene|work=Staff Lists|page=3|title=The Top 200 Albums of the 2000s: 200-151|date=September 28, 2009|access-date=October 1, 2009}}</ref> and number 2 on their list of the top 50 rap mixtapes of the millennium.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/9908-the-50-best-rap-mixtapes-of-the-millennium/?page=5|title=The 50 Best Rap Mixtapes of the Millennium - Page 5}}</ref>

On May 9, 2006 Clipse finally reached an agreement with [[Jive Records]]. They were to release the album through its own [[Re-Up Records]] label along with Jive. They then toured with [[Ice Cube]] throughout May, and set the release date as August 29.<ref name="Reference 2">{{cite web|url=http://allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=5650 |title=Clipse Tour With Ice Cube; Album Release Date Set |last=Lopez |first=Rodrigo |date=May 9, 2006 |work=AllHipHop.com |access-date=April 27, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060521025035/http://www.allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=5650 |archive-date=May 21, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Clipse dropped the first single, "[[Mr. Me Too]]" with [[Pharrell Williams]] on May 23, 2006. It peaked at number 65 on [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart. However, the release date of the album was pushed to October 31. On October 31, Clipse did not drop the album, instead dropped the single "[[Wamp Wamp (What It Do)]]" with [[Slim Thug]]. The song peaked at number 96 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. ''[[Hell Hath No Fury (Clipse album)|Hell Hath No Fury]]'' was finally released on November 28, 2006. The album received universal acclaim with many publications citing it to be the duo's best. The [[hip hop music|hip hop]] magazine ''[[XXL magazine|XXL]]'' gave the album a "XXL" rating, marking it as a five-star album. Only five albums had previously received that honor. The album currently holds an average score of 89 on [[Metacritic]]. It debuted at number 14 on the [[Billboard 200]], selling 80,000 copies in its first week. The album would go on to receive high positions on many publications year and decade end charts, and is considered to be one of the best albums of the 2000s.

===2007–2009: Columbia Records and ''Til the Casket Drops''===
In a May 19, 2007, interview with ''[[Eye Weekly]]'', Clipse revealed that the group had been officially released from its recording contract with Jive.<ref name="Reference 3">{{cite web|url=http://www.eyeweekly.com/eye/issue/issue_05.17.07/music/feature.php|title=Keys Open Doors|last=Morris|first=Dave|date=May 17, 2007|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000821/http://www.eyeweekly.com/eye/issue/issue_05.17.07/music/feature.php|archive-date=September 27, 2007 |work=eyeweekly.com}}</ref> After this, the duo began discussions with several record labels, eventually signing with [[Columbia Records]] on October 26, 2007.<ref name="Reference 5">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1047652/exclusive-the-clipse-signs-with-columbia|title=The Clipse Signs With Columbia|last=Crosley|first=Hillary|date=October 26, 2007|publisher=Nielsen Inc.|work=Billboard.com|access-date=October 26, 2007}}</ref> On February 5, 2008, the duo released the 3rd installment in the We Got it 4 Cheap mixtape series as a free download on their website. On August 8, 2008, the duo released the [[Re-Up Gang]]'s debut studio album, ''[[Clipse Presents: Re-Up Gang|Clipse Presents: The Re-Up Gang]]'' through [[Koch Records]]. The album's first single, "Fast Life", was produced by [[Scott Storch]]. The single was originally slated for the duo's third album, but they felt it would be better used for the Re-Up Gang album. Only Malice and Pusha-T appear on the track. It is the only studio album from the group as after the release of the album, Sandman left the group.

In November 2008, Clipse announced the launch of their fashion line, Play Cloths.<ref name="Reference 7">{{cite web|url=https://theboombox.com/the-clipse-launch-play-cloths-release-new-mixtape/|title=Clipse officially launches fashion line Play Cloths and releases new mixtape|date=November 20, 2008|work=theboombox.com}}</ref> A mixtape called ''Road to Till the Casket Drops'' was released on December 1, 2008 in promotion of the line and their upcoming album.

===2010-present: Solo endeavors, hiatus, and return===
At a concert on April 30, 2010, Malice announced that he and Pusha T would release solo albums later in the year.<ref>Alexis, Nadeska [http://www.theboombox.com/2010/05/05/the-clipse-planning-solo-albums-for-2010/ The Clipse Planning Solo Albums for 2010] at ''The Boombox'' May 2010.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.11195/title.pusha-t-and-malice-going-solo|title=Pusha T and Malice Going Solo?|first=HipHopDX -|last=http://hiphopdx.com|access-date=2010-05-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927082057/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.11195/title.pusha-t-and-malice-going-solo|archive-date=2013-09-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> On September 12, 2010, Pusha T confirmed to [[MTV]] that he had signed to [[Kanye West]]'s [[G.O.O.D.

There have been many rumours of a Clipse reunion. However, No Malice said at SXSW 2014 that the band was finished, that there will not be another Clipse album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2014/03/malice-emphatically-confirms-wrap-clipse/|title=No Malice Emphatically Confirms It's A Wrap For The Clipse - XXL|website=XXL Mag|access-date=2016-04-27}}</ref> But despite that, in a 2016 interview, No Malice said "I’ma tell you that I learned to never say never, and I don't shut the door on anything. I really don't. In fact, I would like to see Clipse do it" in regard to a potential Clipse reunion, adding that "I’ve said it before, my brother and I would definitely make clown soup out of all these MCs.
