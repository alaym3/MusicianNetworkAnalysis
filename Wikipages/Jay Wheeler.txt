== Early life ==

Wheeler was born José Ángel López Martínez on April 25, 1994 to a working class family in [[Salinas, Puerto Rico]]. He first developed an interest in music as a child through singing at his local church, where he also learned to play the piano. Throughout his teenage years Wheeler stopped singing and instead began experimenting with production, after developing a fear of singing in public due to the regular bullying he suffered at school.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite web|url=http://www.reggaeton.co.uk/magazine/music/spotlight/2020/06/21/jay-wheeler|title=Jay Wheeler|date=June 20, 2020|website=Reggaeton.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.primerahora.com/entretenimiento/musica/notas/jay-wheeler-nunca-se-dio-por-vencido/|title=Jay Wheeler nunca se dio por vencido|website=Primera Hora}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated3>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/9404783/jay-wheeler-latin-artist-on-the-rise|title=Latin Artist on the Rise: Jay Wheeler's Bringing His Romantic Flow To Reggaeton|website=Billboard}}</ref> At the age of 16, Wheeler separated from his girlfriend, an incident that inspired him to write a new song, "''Ahora Estoy Mejor''" and record himself singing it. After showing it to a friend, he was encouraged to post it online, where it went viral overnight, generating over 500,000 views and serving as a platform for Wheeler to seriously pursue a career as a musician.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://historia-biografia.com/jay-wheeler/|title=Jay Wheeler|first1=Información personalNombre CompletoJosé Ángel López Martínez|last1=Nacimientonoviembre 21|first2=1994Edad26 añosOcupaciónCantante y compositor Apodo/PseudónimoJay Wheeler NacionalidadPuertorriqueñoGénerosReguetón y trapMovimientosUrbanoSigno|last2=zodiacalEscorpio|date=July 24, 2020}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated3 />

== Career ==

=== Early years (2016–2018) ===
Wheeler used his newfound fanbase to continue to release music through both Instagram and Facebook, building up a steady following and earning the nickname "''La Voz Favorita''" (The Favourite Voice).<ref name=autogenerated3 /> He would later choose to go by the stage name Jay Wheeler; he asked his fans to choose a name that would go with "Jay", eventually choosing Wheeler as the best suggestion; he believed "Jay Wheeler, La Voz Favorita" just sounded right.<ref name=autogenerated3 /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/jay-wheeler-mn0003925202/biography|title=Jay Wheeler &#124; Biography & History|website=AllMusic}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1 /> After a steady number of releases between 2016 and 2018, Wheeler was noticed by Dynamic Records, who signed him to his first record deal. A video of Wheeler bought to tears on stage at the sight of fans singing his music went viral in 2018, and was later seen by [[DJ Nelson]], who reached out to Wheeler and offered to be his mentor.<ref name=autogenerated3 />

=== 2019–present: Platónico, Platónicos and work with DJ Nelson ===

DJ Nelson told Wheeler that he had an exact vision for him as an artist and offered to executively produce his debut studio album ''Platónico'', released in 2019, containing the successful ''Otra Noche Mas'' remix with [[Farruko]].<ref name=autogenerated3 />

Wheeler began work on his second effort soon after, a sequel to his first album to be known as Platónicos.
