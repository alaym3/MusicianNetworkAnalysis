'''Army of the Pharaohs''' (most commonly abbreviated as '''AOTP''' or '''A.O.T.P.''') is an American [[underground hip hop]] [[musical collective|collective]] originating from [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, formed by [[Jedi Mind Tricks]] founder [[Vinnie Paz]] in 1998. The collective has strong links to other underground [[East Coast hip hop|east coast]] groups such as [[OuterSpace|Outerspace]], [[Snowgoons]], [[La Coka Nostra]], [[Demigodz]], [[7L & Esoteric]], and [[JuJu Mob]]. AOTP's affiliations and member roster has changed several times since its formation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicthread.net/2010/12/21/celph-titled-and-buckwild-%E2%80%93-nineteen-ninety-now-album-review/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130222032557/http://www.musicthread.net/2010/12/21/celph-titled-and-buckwild-%E2%80%93-nineteen-ninety-now-album-review/|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 22, 2013|title=Celph Titled and Buckwild – Nineteen Ninety Now album review|access-date=December 15, 2019}}</ref>{{cbignore}}

Paz formed the outfit in the late 1990s with the original roster of [[Bahamadia]], [[Chief Kamachi]], Virtuoso, [[7L & Esoteric]], plus Jedi Mind Tricks' other member [[Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind]]. The group first released the "Five Perfect Exertions" and "War Ensemble" 12" on Paz's short-lived Recordings in 1998, but then the underground supergroup remained silent for several years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.com/jedi-mind-tricks-presents-army-of-the-pharaohs/biography-1968642.html|title=Celebrity Photo Gallery, Celebrity Wallpapers, Celebrity Videos, Bio, News, Songs, Movies|work=in.com|access-date=9 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924042738/http://www.in.com/jedi-mind-tricks-presents-army-of-the-pharaohs/biography-1968642.html|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> After a couple of successful Jedi Mind Tricks albums and a new deal with [[Babygrande]] by 2003, Paz resurrected the crew, adding OuterSpace, [[Celph Titled]], [[Reef the Lost Cauze]], [[King Syze]], [[Des Devious]], and [[Apathy (rapper)|Apathy]]; however, Stoupe, Bahamadia, and Virtuoso had defected from the group. Babygrande issued their "Tear It Down" 12" and first album, ''[[The Torture Papers (album)|The Torture Papers]]'', in 2006. The 2007 follow-up album, [[Ritual of Battle]], saw Jus Allah and JMT protégés [[Doap Nixon]] and [[Demoz (rapper)|Demoz]] joining the Pharaohs.<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/army-of-the-pharaohs Army of the Pharaohs on Answers] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315031646/http://www.answers.com/topic/army-of-the-pharaohs |date=March 15, 2014 }} Written by Cyril Cordor, Rovi</ref>

==Recording history==

===1998&ndash;2003: The original incarnation of the group===
The original incarnation of the group included five [[Master of ceremonies|MC]]s: [[Vinnie Paz]], [[Chief Kamachi]], Esoteric, Virtuoso, and Bahamadia, along with [[Jedi Mind Tricks]] producer [[Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind]]. The group released their debut [[Extended play|EP]]/single "[[The Five Perfect Exertions b/w War Ensemble]]" in 1998.<ref name="thatrealness.blogspot.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://thatrealness.blogspot.co.uk/2008/07/army-of-pharaohs-five-perfect-exertions.html|title=That Realness Is Now Closed!!!|access-date=March 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129015313/http://thatrealness.blogspot.co.uk/2008/07/army-of-pharaohs-five-perfect-exertions.html|archive-date=November 29, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Both tracks were later included on Jedi Minds Tricks' 2000 album ''[[Violent by Design]]''; with "The Five Perfect Exertions" being remixed into "Exertions Remix", and both "Exertions" and "War Ensemble" shedding Chief Kamachi's appearance. The Army of the Pharaohs project was put on the back-burner while JMT's career took off.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Army+of+the+Pharaohs|title=Army of the Pharaohs|work=Last.fm|access-date=March 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626153944/http://www.last.fm/music/Army+of+the+Pharaohs|archive-date=June 26, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2003, AOTP released their debut [[compilation album]] ''[[Rare Shit, Collabos and Freestyles]]''.<ref name="discogs.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Army-Of-The-Pharaohs-Rare-Shit-Collabos-and-Freestyles/release/810368 |title=Army Of The Pharaohs - Rare Shit, Collabos And Freestyles (CDr) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |access-date=August 18, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925201734/http://www.discogs.com/Army-Of-The-Pharaohs-Rare-Shit-Collabos-and-Freestyles/release/810368 |archive-date=September 25, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> It contained various tracks from members of the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xhellz.skyrock.com/3107843461-Army-Of-The-Pharaohs-Rare-Shit-Collabos-&-Freestyles.html|title=Son Profil - Xhellz - Skyrock.com|work=Skyrock|access-date=March 9, 2015}}{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===2004&ndash;2007: ''Torture Papers'' and ''Ritual of Battle''===
[[File:ArmyofthePharaohs.jpg|thumb|left|Prominent members of the group, 2006]]
The group did not return until 2005, without Virtuoso and Bahamadia. The group was now composed of Paz, Kamachi, [[7L & Esoteric]], [[OuterSpace]], [[Apathy (rapper)|Apathy]], [[Celph Titled]], [[Reef the Lost Cauze]], Des Devious, [[King Syze]] and Faez One. After years of anticipation, the group recorded its first album, ''[[The Torture Papers (album)|The Torture Papers]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.undergroundhiphop.com/store/detail.asp?UPC=BBG0324CD|title=Army Of The Pharaohs - Ritual Of Battle - tracklisting, reviews, producer|author=Muhammet the Slav|date=May 30, 2014|work=UGHH|access-date=March 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913222632/http://www.undergroundhiphop.com/store/detail.asp?UPC=BBG0324CD|archive-date=September 13, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> It was released in March 2006 on [[Babygrande Records]]. The album was produced by AOTP affiliates such as DC the MIDI Alien,  Undefined, Beyonder, Loptimist, and German producer Shuko. The album includes the singles "Tear It Down" and "Battle Cry", the former having a music video. The latter was a [[posse cut]] with nine of the group's then ten members. The album entered the top 50 on [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s Top Independent Album Chart, and reached #42 on the magazine's Heatseekers chart. An unofficial continuation of ''The Torture Papers'' soon began circulating around the Internet called ''The Bonus Papers''. It was composed of tracks not released on the album as it was thought that the songs didn't fit the artistic design of the album while others were known to have been extremely political and were possibly held back to reduce controversy.<ref>[http://slumz.boxden.com/f87/army-pharaohs-bonus-papers-975582/ Army Pharaohs - Bonus Papers] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221214740/http://slumz.boxden.com/f87/army-pharaohs-bonus-papers-975582/ |date=February 21, 2014 }} (Accessed: March 2005)</ref>

Army of the Pharaohs released another mixtape in 2007 titled [[After Torture There's Pain]].

''Ritual of Battle'''s single, "Bloody Tears", used a sample taken from the soundtrack of the video game series [[Castlevania]]. The group added four new members for the album: [[Jedi Mind Tricks]] member [[Jus Allah]], [[Doap Nixon]], [[Demoz (rapper)|Demoz]] and King Magnetic. Apathy was not on ''Ritual of Battle'' as he was working on another project with [[Styles of Beyond]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jmthiphop.com/|title=JMTHIPHOP.COM - Official Home of Jedi Mind Tricks, Vinnie Paz, and Army of the Pharaohs|access-date=March 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150309023808/http://www.jmthiphop.com/|archive-date=March 9, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

===2008&ndash;2010: ''Chief Kamachi Feud & The Unholy Terror''===
In 2008, Chief Kamachi of [[JuJu Mob]] left Army of the Pharaohs due to an apparent feud with [[Vinnie Paz]] and [[Apathy (rapper)|Apathy]]. He released a diss track titled ''First Warning'' taking aim at Paz and Apathy. Apparently, it started over an e-mail Apathy didn't respond to from Kamachi, what was written in the e-mail hasn't been disclosed.<ref name="youtube.com"/> Chief Kamachi later went on to saying ''It wasn't nothing personal, it was more or less a business decision.''<ref>[http://www.kevinnottingham.com/2010/04/02/chief-kamachi-speaks-on-fallout-with-jedi-mind-tricksaotp-new-album/ Kevin Nottingham interviews Kamachi] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20140209124519/http://www.kevinnottingham.com/2010/04/02/chief-kamachi-speaks-on-fallout-with-jedi-mind-tricksaotp-new-album/ |date=February 9, 2014 }} chief-kamachi-speaks-on-fallout-with-jedi-mind-tricksaotp-new-album</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rapmusic.com/threads/chief-kamachi-and-apathy-go-at-it-against-each-other-on-interview.1286616/|title=chief kamachi and apathy go at it against each other on interview ...|work=Rapmusic.com|access-date=March 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402115247/http://rapmusic.com/threads/chief-kamachi-and-apathy-go-at-it-against-each-other-on-interview.1286616/|archive-date=April 2, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> On May 17, 2009, Apathy mentioned on his [[Myspace]] blog that a new AOTP album was completely finished.

===2015&ndash;2020: ''Hiatus and departure of Doap Nixon & King Magnetic''===
As of 2015, the group has been on a hiatus whilst they all focus on their solo careers and other ventures. In a 2018 poll, Jedi Mind Tricks, the group that spawned AOTP scored 43.64% in a comparison with rival hip hop group [[Slum Village]], who scored 56.34% as the [[wiktionary:G.O.A.T.|G.O.A.T.]] rap group in the fourth installment of Ambrosia For Heads' annual battle series features.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2018/04/slum-village-vs-jedi-mind-tricks-vote/|title=Finding The GOAT Group: Slum Village vs. Jedi Mind Tricks. Who Is Better?|first=Ambrosia For|last=Heads|date=April 18, 2018|website=Ambrosia For Heads|access-date=September 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180825200444/http://ambrosiaforheads.com/2018/04/slum-village-vs-jedi-mind-tricks-vote/|archive-date=August 25, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

On February 13, 2020, King Magnetic released his diss track towards Vinnie Paz entitled "Be Quiet", thus removing himself from the collective.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3T6dzzqYuY |title=King Magnetic "Be Quiet" (Vinnie Paz Diss) |publisher=YouTube |access-date=February 15, 2020}}</ref> The next day on February 14, 2020, Doap Nixon subsequently released another diss track towards Paz entitled "Leg Shot" on the same day as Paz's fourth studio album ''As Above So Below'', thus removing himself from the collective as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d29jf4ojDIk |title=Leg Shot: Vinnie Paz Diss - Doap Nixon |publisher=YouTube |access-date=February 15, 2020}}</ref> Within their tracks, they both announced their departure from the supergroup.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.siccness.net/wp/doap-nixon-leg-shot-vinnie-paz-diss|title=Doap Nixon Leg Shot Vinnie Pas Diss|work=www.siccness.net|access-date=February 15, 2020}}</ref> The issues between the pair and Paz supposedly started in 2009 with numerous trivial matters which were all squashed in 2015. Magnetic caught up with Paz after his 2016 Jedi Mind Tricks show in Albuquerque, New Mexico and agreed to put aside the differences they had. Unfortunately however, with Nixon's release of ''Sour Diesel II'', Paz threatened to remove his lyrics and track contributions on the album unless Nixon removed King Magnetic's verses from his album. This is what resulted in the releases of the diss track "Be Quiet" by Magnetic which was supposedly recorded many years earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://respect-mag.com/2020/02/whatsbeef-king-magnetic-be-quiet-vinnie-paz-diss/ |title=#WHATSBEEF: King Magnetic - "Be Quiet (Vinnie Paz Diss)" &#124; RESPECT |publisher=Respect-mag.com |access-date=February 15, 2020}}</ref>
