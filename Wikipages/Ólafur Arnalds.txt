==History==

===Early life===
Ólafur's grandmother introduced him to the music of Frédéric Chopin from an early age.<ref>https://www.alternativeclassical.co.uk/interviews/olafur-arnalds</ref>

===Early career (2004–2007)===
In 2004, Ólafur composed and recorded the intro and two outros for tracks on the album ''[[Antigone (album)|Antigone]]'' by German metal band [[Heaven Shall Burn]]. On his Facebook page, he described how he got to know them: "I was playing drums in a hardcore band and we were supporting the German metal band Heaven Shall Burn on their Icelandic tour. Being a huge fan, I gave them a demo with some very overly dramatic prog-rock songs I had been making at home – it was not so classic like this but had some badly computerized strings and piano in it. A few months later they contacted me asked if I would write some intros and outros for their new album, but only with the piano/strings elements – So I wrote my first classical pieces. Their album was a big success in Europe and a few months later I got a phone call from a label asking 'would you be interested in making a full album with compositions like this?' I hadn't really considered continuing writing music like this, but said yes."<ref>{{cite web|last=Arnalds|first=Olafur|title=Song from the past #6|url=https://www.facebook.com/olafurarnalds/posts/462594400427734|work=Facebook|accessdate=22 August 2013|date=1 September 2012}}</ref>

In 2014 Ólafur announced his electronic debut album in collaboration with Janus Rasmussen under his project [[Kiasmos]].

===''The Chopin Project'' and further projects (2015)===

In 2015 Ólafur collaborated with German-Japanese pianist [[Alice Sara Ott]] on ''The Chopin Project'', which was a release to introduce an exciting new take on the music of [[Frédéric Chopin]]. Arnalds chose a program of Chopin works to create an emotional arc throughout the album and then composed linking sections for string quintet, piano, and synthesizer based on the atmosphere and motifs of those pieces.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Chopin Project|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Chopin-Project-%C3%93lafur-Arnalds/dp/B00SJ9UEPU|website=Amazon|accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref>

''The Chopin Project'' began as a dedication to Ólafur’s grandmother, in some respects. Out of respect for her, a younger, metal-loving Ólafur would sit with her to listen to Chopin’s work whenever they had visited one another. At her deathbed, Ólafur said “she was just lying there, old and sick, but very happy and proud. And I sat with her and we listened to a Chopin sonata. Then I kissed her goodbye and left. She passed away a few hours later.”<ref>{{cite web|last1=Frahm|first1=Jonathan|title=The Chopin Project|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/191703-lafur-arnalds-alice-sara-ott-the-choping-project/|website=Pop Matters|accessdate=4 January 2017|date=2 April 2015}}</ref>

In 2015, Ólafur's collaborations with Nils Frahm, ''Life Story Love and Glory'' (a completely improvised recording) and ''Loon'', were collected on a double CD entitled ''Collaborative Works'' along with 2012's ''Stare'' and a live improvisational film entitled ''Trance Frendz - An evening with Ólafur Arnalds and Nils Frahm''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bedian |first1=Knar |title=Interview: Ólafur Arnalds and Pianos That Go Bleep Bloop |url=http://soundofboston.com/interview-olafur-arnalds/ |website=Sound of Boston |publisher=Sound of Boston |accessdate=21 December 2018}}</ref>  2015 also saw the full release of his work on ''[[Broadchurch]]''.

===''Island Songs'' (2016)===

In June 2016 Ólafur announced his ''Island Songs''<ref>{{cite web|title=Island Songs|url=http://www.islandsongs.is/|website=Island Songs|accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref> project, which would involve him working with director Baldvin Z and travelling to seven different locations in Iceland over seven weeks, collaborating with seven different artists. Each week the audio and video for each track would be released, culminating in the final track, "Doria", being released on 8 August 2016.

List of tracks with collaborators:
#"Árbakkinn" (ft. Einar Georg)
#"1995" (ft. Dagný Arnalds)
#"Raddir" (ft. South Iceland Chamber Choir)
#"Öldurót" (ft. [[Atli Örvarsson]] & SinfoniaNord)

===''Re:member'' (2018)===
[[File:Olafur with Stratus Pianos.jpg|thumb|With Stratus Pianos at Iceland Airwaves, 2018]]
Ólafur's fourth official solo album, ''Re:member'' was released in August 2018. The album featured his new musical system called Stratus. The Stratus Pianos are two self-playing, semi-generative player pianos which are triggered by a central piano played by Arnalds. The custom-built software was born out of two years of work by the composer and audio developer, Halldor Eldjarn. As Arnalds plays a note on the piano, two different notes are generated by Stratus, creating unexpected harmonies and surprising melodic sequences. 

The algorithms generated from Stratus were also used to create the album artwork. In an interview with Sound of Boston, Arnalds explains that the artist, Torsten Posselt from FELD studios, used the Stratus software as a starting point and made his own software that translated the same MIDI signals used for the music. Each dot corresponds to a piano note in the title track: 88 fields correspond to 88 notes; the thicker the dot, the higher the frequency of that note being played.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bedian|first1=Knar|title=Interview: Ólafur Arnalds and Pianos That Go Bleep Bloop|url=http://soundofboston.com/interview-olafur-arnalds|website=Sound of Boston|publisher=Sound of Boston|accessdate=21 December 2018}}</ref>

He composed the main theme for the  [[Apple TV|Apple +]] mini series [[Defending Jacob (miniseries)]].
