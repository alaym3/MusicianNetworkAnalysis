On 3 August 2009, in response to the question "How do you find Hayko Cepkin?" in a program on [[Cine5]], Davut Güloğlu said ''"He looks like a monkey, as if he has come out of a horror movie, it's not clear whether he looks like a cat or a dog, the likes of him are [[buffoon]]s, if I see something like him at night, I would definitely attack it."''<ref name="ref749">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com.tr/NewsDetail.aspx?NewsId=6616|title=MTV EMA 2018|website=MTVEMA}}</ref> After his comments, Cepkin took a case to the court and filed a lawsuit on the grounds of "personal offense" and demanded 2 years in prison as punishment for Davut Güloğlu.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://haykocepkin.im/davut-guloglu-yine-polemik-pesinde/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109120328/http://haykocepkin.im/davut-guloglu-yine-polemik-pesinde/ |archive-date=9 January 2014 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>
