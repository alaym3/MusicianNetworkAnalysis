==History==
WLOX announced its grand opening on May 27, 1948 as part of the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]].<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s)/no by-line.--> |title=WLOX Grand Opening Thursday May 27 6AM - 12PM (advertisement) |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/81587982/ |work=Sun Herald |location=Biloxi, Mississippi |date=May 26, 1948 |page=five|via=newspapers.com}}</ref>

In 2018, [[Alpha Media]] sold its Biloxi stations, including WANG, to Telesouth Communications.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Alpha Sells Biloxi Cluster To Telesouth|url=https://radioinsight.com/headlines/172784/alpha-sells-biloxi-cluster-to-telesouth/|access-date=2020-12-27|website=RadioInsight|language=en-US}}</ref> The sale was consummated on March 1, 2019, at a price of $2.5 million.

On March 8, 2019, WANG ended its sports format simulcast with [[WTNI]], and changed its format to classic country, branded as "103.5 The Possum".<ref>[https://radioinsight.com/headlines/175060/pair-of-classic-country-flips-in-biloxi/ Pair of Classic Country Flips in Biloxi] Radioinsight - March 8, 2019</ref> In June 2019, WTNI ended the remaining sports programming and also flipped to classic country, by resuming its simulcast of WANG.

On December 22, 2020, translator station W278CE moved to 106.3, and WANG and WTNI flipped to a [[Travelers' information station|tourist information]] format as ''106.3 Casino Radio''. The stations primarily carry segments and advertising highlighting local casinos, restaurants, and other attractions in the Biloxi area.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Casino Radio Debuts In Biloxi|url=https://radioinsight.com/headlines/203241/casino-radio-debuts-in-biloxi/|access-date=2020-12-25|date=2020-12-22|website=RadioInsight|language=en-US}}</ref>

On October 10, 2021 WANG and WTNI changed their formats from tourist information to adult hits, branded as "Bob 106.3".<ref>[https://radioinsight.com/headlines/213956/bob-returns-to-biloxi-gulfport/ Bob Returns To Biloxi/Gulfport] Radioinsight - October 10, 2021</ref>
