==Early life==
Jonathan Monroe Craig was born in [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Minot, North Dakota]].<ref name="altpress.com"/> In a further interview with the music blog ''Eat Yo Beats'', Jonny said "my mom made me listen to tons of shit when I was kid, everything from [[Michael Bolton]] to some weird ass Christian rock bands" and also that it was this that became his main influence, rather than gospel music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eatyobeats.com/jonny-craig-eat-yo-beats-featured-artist-for-april-2013|title=Interview with Jonny Craig|website=EatYoBeats.com}}</ref> Craig cites some of his early idols as [[Boyz II Men]] and [[New Found Glory]].

He was put into the school choir as a default elective but was ultimately kicked out. As a child, he says that he "had a hard time keeping out of trouble" and that "high school wasn't for him." He would explain later that that was the reason he left high school and attained his G.E.D, then focused on music full-time. "I just wanted an escape from a lot of the things when I was a child I guess. I just wanted to get away from a lot of the problems that I was dealing with at home and stuff", Craig states in an interview with [[KLSU]] radio as his reason for starting his path in music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8EXHNhd234 |title=YouTube |publisher=[[YouTube]] |access-date=2016-01-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R4yransyRI |title=Emarosa VIdeo Interview HARDTIMES.CA |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2009-01-29 |access-date=2016-01-07}}</ref>

==Music career==
===Beginnings as a musician (2000&ndash;2007)===
After moving to America and attending high school in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]], Craig auditioned for bands but ultimately was not accepted into one. Craig then formed the band westerHALTS in 2000, a [[garage rock|garage band]] from [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], Washington. At age 15, Craig released his first known song with them titled "Change, Leisure, and Retirement" in 2001. In an [[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]] Podcast he stated that the band was "...just something to help pay for weed, something I played over the weekends." He then joined as the lead vocalist for [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]]-based [[pop punk]] band Ghost Runner on Third in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.purevolume.com/ghostrunneronthird |title=Ghost Runner on Third at |website=Purevolume.com |access-date=2011-02-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628182251/http://www.purevolume.com/ghostrunneronthird |archive-date=June 28, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Jonny Craig says that he met the guitarist in high school. He received positive reviews with this band's debut EP, Speak Your Dreams, released on January 4, 2005. [[AllMusic]] stated that Craig was, "the band's secret weapon, a passionate vocalist. There's not a bad track to be found here, but Craig tends to outshine his bandmates throughout."<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r718606|pure_url=yes}} Speak Your Dreams Review]. [[Allmusic]].</ref>

Early on in his career with Ghost Runner On Third it has been cited that overwhelming drug problems led to his departure, as told by [[Dance Gavin Dance]] in an old blog post concerning Craig after he was kicked out of the band. Though Craig has denied the statements made, [[Dance Gavin Dance]] has not backed off from those remarks, which they explain was the reason for all the band's problems and partly for his former band Ghost Runner on Third.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=9718 |title=Dance Gavin Dance kicks out singer |website=Lambgoat.com |date=2007-11-10 |access-date=2016-01-07}}</ref> Dance Gavin Dance has also partially blamed guitarist Sean O'Sullivan's departure on Craig's behavior, although there were other contributing factors. Despite their past differences, both past and present members of [[Dance Gavin Dance]] have since become friends. Consider the Thief (O'Sullivan's previous band), was also listed in Emarosa's ''[[Relativity (Emarosa album)|Relativity]]'' album on the "special thanks" section of the info-booklet.

===Dance Gavin Dance and Emarosa (2007&ndash;2012)===
Jonny Craig's singing in Dance Gavin Dance's debut EP [[Whatever I Say Is Royal Ocean]] and debut full-length album, [[Downtown Battle Mountain]], received positive reviews from critics. [[Allmusic]] stated that "co-frontman Jonny Craig's regularly hysterical yelping may change your mind forever."<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1058992|pure_url=yes}} Downtown Battle Mountain Review]. [[Allmusic]].</ref>

In March 2007, it was explained that Jonny Craig came up with the name ''Dance Gavin Dance'' and had planned to name his previous band, "Ghost Runner On Third", by that name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=224538 |title=Dance Gavin Dance - 03.27.07 - Interview |website=AbsolutePunk.net |access-date=2016-01-07}}</ref> After being kicked out of Dance Gavin Dance after the "Saints and Sinners Festival" in New Jersey, Jonny Craig immediately filled in for [[A Skylit Drive]]'s Lead Vocalist  Jordan Blake while he was ill. The band said at shows, and on their website, that he was not the new lead singer and the situation would only be temporary. It had been only two weeks since he quit [[Dance Gavin Dance]] in which he joined [[Emarosa]] who was left without a lead singer.

On August 18, 2010, [[Dance Gavin Dance]] parted ways with vocalist Kurt Travis, and Jonny Craig, along with other original vocalist, Jon Mess, returned to the band to record a new album. The reunited lineup would also embark on a headlining run the following spring. Craig was to remain in Emarosa as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/exclusive_dance_gavin_dance_part_ways_with_vocalist_original_vocalist_/ |title=News &#124; Exclusive: Dance Gavin Dance part ways with vocalist, original vocalist Jonny Craig back |website=Altpress.com |date=2010-08-18 |access-date=2011-02-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205130737/http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/exclusive_dance_gavin_dance_part_ways_with_vocalist_original_vocalist_/ |archive-date=February 5, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The rapper [[Game (rapper)|Game]] and [[DJ Skee]] sampled Craig's vocals on the song "Heels & Dresses" from their Break Lights mixtape album, which comes from the song "The Robot With Human Hair Pt. 1."{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Rapper [[Bizzy Bone]] also sampled Craig's vocals on the song "Bottled Up Like Smoke" from his Crossover EP and Crossroads album, using portions of "I Still Feel Her pt. III" from his debut solo album, "A Dream Is a Question You Don't Know How to Answer."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allhiphop.com/stories/news/archive/2010/07/24/22309577.aspx |title=Daily News - : Bizzy Bone Prepping Heavy Metal Mash Up With New Deal |website=Allhiphop.com |access-date=2011-02-21}}</ref>

On April 11, 2011, Emarosa publicly announced that Jonny Craig would no longer be a member of the group. According to a statement made by the band, "This decision has been a hard one to make, but we feel it is in the best interest for the band going forward."<ref name="altpress-outofEmarosa"/> "Jonny Craig" was the top trending topic on [[Twitter]] the day of the announcement.

On August 13, 2012, Jonny Craig was "kicked out" of Dance Gavin Dance yet again for reasons pertaining to Craig being "publicly scolded by the owner of [[Sumerian Records]] for multiple offenses".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinsider.net/drama/dance-gavin-dances-jonny-craig-kicked-off-of-the-all-stars-tour |title=Dance Gavin Dance's Jonny Craig Kicked Off Of The All Stars Tour |publisher=[[Metal Insider]] |date=2012-08-13 |access-date=2016-01-07}}</ref> The news surfaced after Jonny released a statement on his personal Twitter.

===Isles & Glaciers (2008&ndash;2010)===
In early September 2008, [[Chiodos]] and [[Cinematic Sunrise]] vocalist [[Craig Owens (musician)|Craig Owens]], announced that both he and Jonny Craig would be recording an EP record by the end of the year, also mentioning [[Vic Fuentes]] and others.<ref>[http://www.iamcraigowens.com/2008/09/04/5-records-for-september/#comments ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016030716/http://www.iamcraigowens.com/2008/09/04/5-records-for-september/#comments |date=October 16, 2008 }}</ref>

On December 15, 2008, [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] officially announced and revealed the name and lineup of this new project, [[Isles & Glaciers]]. The band's first EP, [[The Hearts of Lonely People]], was produced by Casey Bates in Seattle, Washington, was reworked in April 2009 in [[Michigan]] and was released March 9, 2010.

A tweet reading in part "...and people wonder why we won't do another I & G record."<ref>{{cite web|last=Owens|first=Craig|title=Twitter / @Craig Owens|url=https://www.twitter.com/craigowens/status/39791369199435776|archive-url=https://archive.today/20131115160703/https://www.twitter.com/craigowens/status/39791369199435776|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 15, 2013|publisher=[[Twitter]]|access-date=May 22, 2012|date=February 21, 2011}}</ref> was sent out by [[Craig Owens (entertainer)|Craig Owens]] in 2011, as the MacBook scandal was breaking. This suggests that Isles & Glaciers will be unlikely to release any further albums, at least with a lineup that includes Jonny Craig.

Jonny Craig talked about Isles and Glaciers in an interview stating he would be willing to participate in making a new record, but suspects tension with what he calls, "the more popular people in the group".

===Solo work (2009–2014)===
Jonny Craig released his debut solo album ''[[A Dream Is a Question You Don't Know How to Answer]]'' on August 18, 2009, through [[Rise Records]]. This is the first individual artist on the label. For promotional purposes he took press photos for the release in late 2009 with photographer Gage Young in Orlando, Florida.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/gageyoungphotography/3246932339/ |title=Gage Young at |publisher=[[Flickr.com]] |access-date=2011-02-21}}</ref> He further released three songs on his Myspace profile from the solo album, titled; "Istillfeelher III", "Children of Divorce" and "7 AM, 2 Bottles And The Wrong Road". Craig went on his first solo tour from November through December, supporting acts [[AFI (band)|AFI]], [[Cinematic Sunrise]], and then headlining with support from Tides of Man and [[Sleeping With Sirens]]. He was headlining a tour with support from [[Tides of Man]] and [[Eye Alaska]] and will be playing [[The Bamboozle]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://party.thebamboozle.com/page/california-lineup|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091116221350/http://party.thebamboozle.com/page/california-lineup|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 16, 2009|title=California Lineup - The Bamboozle Music Festivals|date=November 16, 2009|access-date=February 16, 2019}}</ref> festival and [[SXSW]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://my.sxsw.com/events/eid/11012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425040313/http://my.sxsw.com/events/eid/11012|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 25, 2010|title=SXSW: Jonny Craig|date=April 25, 2010|access-date=February 16, 2019}}</ref>

Craig was featured in Alternative Press's issue #288 that was released June 5, 2012.

In November 2012, somebody hacked Craig's personal e-mail that contained some demos that circulated on the internet; Craig stated the leaked material will not be on his upcoming solo EP. From Craig's personal Twitter page: "don't trip the songs that leaked are not what my album is going to sound like. that was me just fucking around with some stuff."{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Craig set up an account on [[Indiegogo]] where fans donated money to produce Craigs upcoming EP. He also confirmed in a recent interview that he has bought out his contract with Rise Records. He released his solo EP, Find What You Love and Let It Kill You, on September 24, 2013, as an independent release.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

On November 26, 2013 Jonny has released the Special Edition of Find What You Love And Let It Kill You. The Special Edition includes a new song, which features two people that paid to be on the album from the Indiegogo campaign. He has also released a new song, "Dirty Christmas" which is available also on November 26, 2013. In an interview with rockforevernagazine, Jonny has said he wants to do "maybe one or two more tours(before recording), with me as like a third spot... Maybe a Circa tour?" He also said that his new second album may be coming out next year. He also has stated him and Kyle Lucas are making an album together. On January 15, Jonny stated he was starting a new band. The following day, he tweeted that the band's name would be Slaves. According to ''Under the Gun Review'', along with Craig as lead vocalist, Slaves will consist of guitarists Jason Mays, Alex Lyman, and Christopher Kim, drummer Tai Wright, and bassist Colin Vieira.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jacob Tender |url=http://www.underthegunreview.net/2014/01/15/exclusive-details-meet-jonny-craigs-new-band |title=EXCLUSIVE DETAILS: Meet Jonny Craig's New Band |website=Underthegunreview.net |date=2014-01-15 |access-date=2016-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303170300/http://www.underthegunreview.net/2014/01/15/exclusive-details-meet-jonny-craigs-new-band/ |archive-date=March 3, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Slaves (2014-2019)===
Artery Recordings have announced the signing of Jonny Craig's new band, [[Slaves (American band)|Slaves]], which also features members Alex Lyman and Christopher Kim ([[Hearts & Hands]]) with Tai Wright ([[Four Letter Lie]]). The band have released their debut album in the summer of 2014 via Artery. They've released a short video trailer, which features clips of the new music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com |title=Home - Alternative Press |website=Altpress.com |access-date=2016-01-07}}</ref> The band's debut album entitled Through Art We Are All Equals, was released June 24, 2014 via Artery Recordings. The album features guest vocals from Kyle Lucas, Tyler Carter of [[Issues (band)|Issues]] and Vic Fuentes of [[Pierce The Veil]]. Its lead single "The Fire Down Below" premiered April 22, 2014.<ref>{{cite web |author=Kriston McConnell |url=http://www.underthegunreview.net/2014/04/08/slaves-confirm-release-date-for-debut-album/ |title=Slaves Confirm Release Date For Debut Album |website=Underthegunreview.net |date=2014-04-08 |access-date=2016-01-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126051416/http://underthegunreview.net/2014/04/08/slaves-confirm-release-date-for-debut-album/ |archive-date=January 26, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In early 2015, Craig released the albums ''[[The Blueprint For Going In Circles]]'', in collaboration with singer-songwriter Kyle Lucas, and ''The Le Cube Sessions'', respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/jonny_craig_drops_surprise_album |title=Jonny Craig drops surprise album - News - Alternative Press |website=Altpress.com |date=2015-03-26 |access-date=2016-01-07}}</ref>

In 2017, Slaves released a new single entitled "I'd Rather See Your Star Explode" along with an accompanying music video. The group's third studio album, ''[[Beautiful Death (Slaves album)|Beautiful Death]]'' was released on February 16, 2018. An acoustic EP called "Revision" was released on January 18, 2019.

The following Thursday, January 24, 2019, in a message posted on the band's official Twitter account, Slaves announced that they had removed Jonny Craig from the band. The message stated, in part, “We all have struggles in our daily life, but for some, those struggles are personally and physically dangerous. It is no secret that Jonny has battled with addiction in his personal life, sometimes those battles are won, and most recently lost. It's also unfair for a band to rely on someone who just can't rely on themselves. Addiction is a disease, and we hope Jonny gets the help that he needs. Unfortunately, Jonny chose his addiction over the band and left them high & dry while checking in for their international flight while he boarded a plane back home.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mobile.twitter.com/SLAVESOFFICIAL/status/1088408995474358272|title=Twitter|website=mobile.twitter.com|access-date=February 16, 2019}}</ref>

Currently, Jonny Craig remains a solo artist, with his second and most recent solo album release being "The Places We'll Never Be" on September 10, 2021.

== Controversies ==

===Internet scam and drug-related issues===
In February 2011, several of Craig's fans accused him of being involved in an internet scam. According to the alleged victims, Craig would claim to be selling a used [[MacBook]] through his Twitter account. After accepting an online payment on average between [[USD|US$]]600 and $800 for the product from at least 16 individuals, Craig was reported to have discontinued communication with the buyers, and no MacBooks were ever distributed. He initially denied the accusations and claimed that his Twitter had been hacked and he had no involvement.<ref name="meb-breaking-story" /> However, the following week it was announced that Craig had dropped off his current tour in Emarosa with Chiodos to enter [[drug detoxification|detox]] in order to treat his ongoing battles with [[heroin addiction]]. Rise Records and the Artery Foundation assumed financial responsibility for the internet scam and intended to reimburse anyone who had been victimized. [[Tilian Pearson]], formerly of [[Tides of Man]], substituted for Craig during his absence from [[Dance Gavin Dance]].<ref name="altpress-rehab" /> A public apology was issued after his detox treatment was completed on March 8, 2011.<ref name="altpress-apology" />

In October 2011, Craig was jailed for two counts of possession of narcotics, two counts of possession of drug paraphernalia, and one count of [[failure to appear]] on a felony charge with bail set at US$15,000. As a result of this incident, Dance Gavin Dance cancelled their upcoming tour and went on hiatus.<ref name="altpress-narcoticscharges" /><ref name="noisecreep-arrested" /> Craig was released from jail a few weeks later and was scheduled to enter a court-ordered rehabilitation facility. His follow-up hearing was scheduled for April 30, 2012.<ref name="altpress-jailrelease" /> Dance Gavin Dance went on with their tour as planned but without Craig. He completed a 30-day court-ordered detox and was released March 30, 2012. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

On April 2, 2014,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theprp.com/2014/04/02/news/jonny-craig-slaves-etc-fends-off-new-drug-use-accusations |title=Jonny Craig (Slaves, Etc.)

Craig addressed the issue in a now-deleted video where he took a drug test on screen. He is quoted saying, "just woke up to a nice surprise from the ex. So I'm headed right down to the office to prove to you guys without a doubt I'm not using and that those videos are old. She's crossed a line and needs to get it through her head that this isn't the way you deal with someone not loving you anymore. So let's go! I have nothing to hide".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkeqjwJEmZs |title=Jonny Craig drug test (CLEAN) |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2014-04-02 |access-date=2016-01-07}}</ref>

On April 14, 2016, a few days following Slaves' split, Craig posted an open letter via the band's official Facebook page, confessing that he was continuing to struggle from his addiction and will seek the help he needs following his already booked solo tour. The tour consisted of the US and a few European dates with Slaves (with select members).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadpress.co.uk/60684/news-jonny-craig-posts-open-letter-confesses-hes-struggling |title=NEWS: Jonny Craig posts open letter; confesses he's struggling |website=deadpress.co.uk |date=2016-04-14 |access-date=2016-04-14}}</ref> On May 20, 2016, Jonny announced on Slaves's Facebook page that the band was going through difficult times but had not broken up. Jonny and Colin were the only members remaining at this point.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/slaves_share_new_statement_no_we_didnt_break_up/|title=Slaves share new statement: "No we didn't break up"|date=May 20, 2016|website=Altpress.com|access-date=February 16, 2019}}</ref>

On January 24, 2019, in a Twitter post made by the official account for Slaves, it was announced that Jonny Craig had been kicked out of the band. The message said in part, "We all have struggles in our daily life, but for some, those struggles are personally and physically dangerous. It is no secret that Jonny has battled with addiction in his personal life, sometimes those battles are won, and most recently lost. It's also unfair for a band to rely on someone who just can't rely on themselves. Addiction is a disease, and we hope Jonny gets the help that he needs. Unfortunately, Jonny chose his addiction over the band and left them high & dry while checking in for their international flight while he boarded a plane back home.”

The Bristol UK show after this post was cancelled, but the tour resumed with [[Matt McAndrew]], a former contestant from ''[[The Voice (American TV series)|The Voice]]'', as a temporary choice for his replacement. Matt then became their permanent addition, and in 2020 they announced they would be permanently changing their name from "Slaves" after the release of their newest album, further showing their progression as a group.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-06-26|title=Slaves Announce They're Changing Their Band Name|url= https://www.spin.com/2020/06/slaves-announce-theyll-be-changing-their-band-name/|website=Spin|language=en}}</ref>

=== Sexual assault allegations ===
In 2015, Slaves were kicked off the [[Warped Tour]] after Craig sexually harassed a female merchandise worker.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-07-20|title=Slaves Voted Off Warped Tour For Allegedly Assaulting Merch Girl, Dumping Sewage|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1817569/slaves-voted-off-warped-tour-for-allegedly-assaulting-merch-girl-dumping-sewage/news/|access-date=2020-11-11|website=Stereogum|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Warped Tour's Kevin Lyman & Slaves' Jonny Craig Respond to Band's Dismissal From Tour|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/6648353/warped-tour-kevin-lyman-slaves-jonny-craig-sexual-harassment-2015|access-date=2020-11-11|website=Billboard|language=en}}</ref>

In 2017, numerous women accused Craig of sexual assault and rape, which led to Slaves being dropped from their record label, [[Artery Recordings]], shortly before the scheduled release of their third album [[Beautiful Death (Slaves album)|''Beautiful Death'']].<ref>{{cite web|date=November 17, 2017|title=Artery Recordings drops Slaves|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/artery_recordings_drops_slaves/|access-date=February 16, 2019|website=Altpress.com}}</ref>

In 2019, Craig was accused of sexual assault and domestic violence from his ex-girlfriend, Taylor Nicole Dean, in a lengthy video posted to her [[YouTube]] channel.<ref>{{cite web|date=December 31, 2019|title=My Experience with my Ex.

==Personal life==
In a 2013 acoustic set with music magazine ''[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]'', Johnny Craig explained the story behind his single "Children of Divorce." Craig said his then girlfriend had become pregnant, and after an admission by Craig months later that he didn't love her, she left. He said he never heard from her again and was unable to see his child.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2013-05-22|title=Acoustic Story: Jonny Craig, "Children Of Divorce"|url=https://www.altpress.com/features/acoustic_story_jonny_craig_children_of_divorce/|access-date=2019-03-10|website=Alternative Press|language=en-US}}</ref>

Jonny is also father to his son, Storm Parker-Monroe Craig, his first child with current fiancée Sydney England "Syd", as they revealed their pregnancy on March 27, 2020 and announced their son's birth on July 13 2020.<ref>{{cite web|date=2020-07-14|title=Jonny Craig and Girlfriend Syd Welcome Baby Boy, Storm Parker-Monroe Craig|url= https://musicmayhemmagazine.com/jonny-craig-and-girlfriend-syd-welcome-baby-boy-storm-parker-monroe-craig/|access-date=2021-10-03|website=Music Mayhem Magazine|language=en}}</ref> The couple announced their engagement on September 3, 2020 on his Instagram, and he's since been filmed possibly proposing a second time to her during his tour.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-09-03|title=Jonny Craig Instagram|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/CFfTZHNhc1l/?utm_medium=copy_link|website=Instagram|language=en-US}}</ref>


In an interview, Craig proceeded to describe himself as an atheist with a Christian background especially in music. He states that all of his music is soulful and has some kind of meaning mainly because his music career began as a child singing gospel music with his church/school.<ref name="youtube.com">{{cite web|title=Exclusive Interview: JONNY CRAIG|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8EXHNhd234|access-date=2011-02-21|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> Jonny Craig gives all credit for his musical talent to his grandmother (Ruth Lyons) who he says, "taught me everything I know about music, she was super Christian, super gospel. Her husband was a preacher. She taught me everything I know about music and despite the fact that I may not believe in her beliefs, I believe in what she taught me."<ref name="youtube.com"/>

Craig is inspired by [[soul music]], mainly artists [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Boyz II Men]], and [[Craig David]]. He has also mentioned [[Motown]] acts and the band [[Mewithoutyou]] as influences.<ref name="youtube.com"/><ref>{{cite web|date=2009-10-05|title=fuck yeah, jonny craig|url=http://fuckyeahjonnycraig.tumblr.com/post/205199287/to-say-jonny-craig-has-been-busy-would-be-an|access-date=2016-01-07|website=Fuckyeahjonnycraig.tumblr.com}}</ref> Craig has performed live covers of the songs "[[Cry Me a River (Justin Timberlake song)|Cry Me a River]]" by [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Marvins Room]] by [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] and "[[Fuck You (Cee Lo Green song)|Fuck You]]" by [[Cee Lo Green]]. 

''Hollywood Music Magazine'' stated of Craig, "The guy's a legend and if you've yet to hear him sing you have been missing out."<ref>{{cite web|date=2010-08-16|title=Jonny Craig "Album Review"|url=http://hollywoodmusicmagazine.com/whoshot/albumreviews/jonny-craig-album-review/|access-date=2016-01-07|publisher=Hollywood Music Magazine}}</ref>
