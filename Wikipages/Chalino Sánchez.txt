'''Rosalino Sánchez  Félix''' (30 August 1960 - 16 May 1992), known profesionally as '''Chalino Sánchez''', was a Mexican singer and songwriter. He specialized in [[Regional Mexican]] music and was especially famous for his [[corrido]]s. Chalino's son [[Adán Sánchez|Adán Chalino Sánchez]] was born 14 April 1984, and was also a Regional Mexican singer in his own right.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://elnorte.estrellatv.com/notas/hoy-se-cumplen-10-anos-de-la-muerte-de-adan-chalino-sanchez/|title=Hoy se cumplen 10 años de la muerte de Adan "Chalino" Sanchez|date=March 27, 2014|publisher=[[KQQK]]|language=Spanish|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029160651/http://elnorte.estrellatv.com/notas/hoy-se-cumplen-10-anos-de-la-muerte-de-adan-chalino-sanchez/|archive-date=October 29, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Adán died in a [[Traffic collision|car crash]] in Sinaloa in 2004.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/80906.fallece-adan-chalino-sanchez.html|title=Fallece Adán 'Chalino' Sánchez|date=March 27, 2004|work=El Siglo de Torreón|language=Spanish}}</ref>

==Early life==
Rosalino Sánchez Félix was born on "El Guayabo", a small ranch in [[Sinaloa]], Mexico. He was the youngest of 7 children. His parents were Santos Sanchez (?–1964) and Senorina Felix (?–1991). Chalino grew up poor and lived a difficult life. His sister, Juana, called him a curious and mischievous child who always dreamed about becoming a singer. His birth name is Rosalino, but he later changed it to his nickname Chalino.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Src='https://Www.gravatar.com/Avatar/D41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e?s=80|first=<img Class='guest_author_avatar Avatar' Style='width:20px;height:20px'|last2=d=mm|last3=Weekly|first3=r=g'/>L A.|date=1998-07-29|title=Sing Now, Die Later|url=https://www.laweekly.com/sing-now-die-later-2/|access-date=2021-05-26|website=LA Weekly|language=en-US}}</ref>

In 1975, at the age of 15, his sister was raped by "Chapo" Perez, a rich and dangerous man.{{Citation needed|reason=the article cited does not contain the name or descriptors about him, need to cite source of name|date=May 2021}} Two years later in 1977, a 17-year-old Chalino saw the man at a party and allegedly shot him in revenge, killing him.<ref>{{Cite web|last=POV|date=2006-01-17|title=El Valiente: Chalino Sánchez {{!}} Al Otro Lado {{!}} POV {{!}} PBS|url=http://archive.pov.org/alotrolado/el-valiente-chalino-sanchez|access-date=2021-05-26|website=POV {{!}} American Documentary Inc.|language=en-US}}</ref> After committing this act, Sanchez left for [[Tijuana]] with his gun and a [[Jesús Malverde]] chain. During his time in Tijuana, he worked as a [[Coyote (person)|"coyote"]] (an immigrant smuggler), bringing immigrants into the United States.

The same year, Chalino himself crossed into the United States as an undocumented migrant worker. He began in [[Oregon]] and later moved to [[Los Angeles]] to live with his aunt in [[Inglewood, California]]. He washed dishes, sold cars, and, according to his friends, dealt small quantities of marijuana and cocaine. He also helped his older brother, Armando, run an immigrant-smuggling operation.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Src='https://Www.gravatar.com/Avatar/D41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e?s=80|first=<img Class='guest_author_avatar Avatar' Style='width:20px;height:20px'|last2=d=mm|last3=Weekly|first3=r=g'/>L A.|date=1998-07-29|title=Sing Now, Die Later|url=https://www.laweekly.com/sing-now-die-later-2/|access-date=2021-05-26|website=LA Weekly|language=en-US}}</ref>

Chalino met Marisela Vallejos through his cousin, Rosalba; in 1984 they married in a simple and intimate wedding. They married with their son, [[Adán Sánchez]], on the way and had a second child, Cynthia Sanchez. They were married until Chalino Sanchez's death in 1992.

== Career ==
In 1984, Armando was shot and killed in a hotel in Tijuana, which inspired Chalino to compose his first corrido, or ballad.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Shazam|url=https://www.shazam.com/track/59656766/recordando-a-armando-sanchez|access-date=2021-05-25|website=Shazam}}</ref> Around this time, Chalino was arrested. He began to compose songs for his fellow inmates and anyone that had a story worth telling.<ref>{{Cite web|last=POV|date=2006-01-17|title=El Valiente: Chalino Sánchez {{!}} Al Otro Lado {{!}} POV {{!}} PBS|url=http://archive.pov.org/alotrolado/el-valiente-chalino-sanchez|access-date=2021-05-25|website=POV {{!}} American Documentary Inc.|language=en-US}}</ref> Chalino began to earn money through his compositions and would be gifted with guns and 'presents' by his customers. Among his many customers are Lucio Villareal, El Pelavacas,<ref>{{Cite web|title=El pela vacas LETRA - Chalino Sanchez|url=https://www.musica.com/letras.asp?letra=1383638|access-date=2021-05-26|website=musica.com|language=es}}</ref> and Jorge "El Coquio" Castro. A small group known as "Los Cuatro de la Frontera" recommended Chalino go to a recording studio in [[Olympic Boulevard (Los Angeles)|Olympic Boulevard]] in [[Los Angeles]]. The studio was called San Angel Records and was owned by Angel Mariscal. Originally another artist was meant to sing Chalino's songs, but he cancelled, so Chalino sang his own songs.

In 1989, Chalino recorded his first cassette of 15 songs. While selling his cassettes out of his car trunk, Chalino stocked tapes at local swapmeets, bakeries, and various other businesses across [[South Los Angeles|South Central Los Angeles]]. Chalino connected with another Mexican immigrant, Pedro Rivera, who had set up a small recording studio in [[Long Beach, California]]. Called Cintas Acuario, this studio allowed aspiring musicians to record for cheap.

Chalino and Rivera pioneered the "prohibited corridos" (corrido prohibido), songs that mythologized drug smugglers, murderers or "valientes". The Cintas Acuario roster (which later included Pedro’s children, [[Lupillo Rivera|Lupillo]], [[Juan Rivera (singer)|Juan]], and the late [[Jenni Rivera]]) was not initially aired on radio, but they became the foundation of the Latino genre in Los Angeles.

Promoters across the Southland quickly sought to book Chalino at their clubs. Chalino sang his songs, in his cadence and Sinaoloan slang, something no big singer had ever tried to do.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Twenty-Five Years After His Murder, Chalino Sánchez Remains As Influential As Ever – OC Weekly|url=https://www.ocweekly.com/twenty-five-years-after-his-murder-chalino-sanchez-remains-as-influential-as-ever-8149408/|access-date=2021-05-25|website=www.ocweekly.com}}</ref>

=== 1992 Coachella Incident ===
On 25 January 1992, Chalino was hired to sing at Los Arcos night club in the desert city of [[Coachella, California|Coachella]]. During his performance, Eduardo Gallegos, 34, a local unemployed mechanic of [[Thermal, California]], under the influence, jumped up on stage and began firing a small .25 caliber pistol at Chalino. Chalino pulled a 10mm pistol from his waistband and began a running gun battle chasing Gallegos. Four hundred people were in attendance of which seven to ten people were reportedly hit in the exchange. Among them was Chalino and the group accordionist, Ignacio ‘Nacho’ Hernandez. A local man, 20-year-old Claudio Rene Carranza was killed. A bystander wrestled and killed Gallegos with his own pistol. Chalino was in critical condition and underwent surgery at [[Torney General Hospital|Desert Hospital]], [[Palm Springs]].

The shooting made [[ABC World News Tonight|ABCWorld News Tonight]] as well as both U.S. and Spanish-speaking newspapers. Chalino saw success with his sales and began getting airplay, although it was a single, old-fashioned, non-narco song called “Nieves de Enero”. His next Los Angeles appearance at El Parral, doors had to close at 6 pm, 5–6 hours before he was due on stage.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Valdemar|first=Richard|title=Chalino Sanchez and the Narcocorridos|url=https://www.policemag.com/373240/chalino-sanchez-and-the-narcocorridos|access-date=2021-05-26|website=www.policemag.com|language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=News|first=Deseret|date=1992-01-26|title=GUNFIRE AT NIGHTCLUB KILLS 1 MAN, INJURES 10, INCLUDING PERFORMER|url=https://www.deseret.com/1992/1/26/18964171/gunfire-at-nightclub-kills-1-man-injures-10-including-performer|access-date=2021-05-26|website=Deseret News|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=POV|date=2006-01-17|title=El Valiente: Chalino Sánchez {{!}} Al Otro Lado {{!}} POV {{!}} PBS|url=http://archive.pov.org/alotrolado/el-valiente-chalino-sanchez|access-date=2021-05-26|website=POV {{!}} American Documentary Inc.|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Murder==
On 15 May 1992, 4 months after the Coachella incident, Chalino performed at the Salon Bugambilias, [[Culiacán]]. In the video of the incident, an audience member can be seen handing him something, widely believed to be a note telling him he would die after he was done performing. Chalino looked around nervously for a few seconds, before resuming his performance with all the passion he was known for, despite knowing this would probably be his last show.

After midnight, Chalino drove away from the club with two of his brothers, a cousin, and several young women. They were pulled over by a group of armed men in unmarked cars. They showed [[state police]] ID cards and told Chalino their commandant wanted to see him. Chalino agreed and got into one of their cars while the others followed behind.{{Citation needed|reason=the article cited does not contain the name or descriptors about him, need to cite source of name|date=May 2021}}

At 6 am on 16 May 1992, two farmers found Chalino’s body by an irrigation canal near Highway 15, near the neighbourhood of Los Laureles, Culiacán. He was blindfolded and his wrists had rope marks. He had been shot in the back of the head.{{Citation needed|reason=the article cited does not contain the name or descriptors about him, need to cite source of name|date=May 2021}}

Nobody was ever arrested for Sanchez's killing, but because he was pulled out of his car by Sinaloa State Police officers, it is likely he was extrajudicially executed on behalf of the Sinaloa Cartel, who he had often spoken out against, as its members had raped his sister and killed his brother. The Sinaloa State Police is known to carry out assassinations on behalf of the cartel.

==Legacy==
Since his death, his fame and recordings have grown in popularity. Chalino still amasses millions of streams nearly 3 decades after his death and remains popular with young Hispanic listeners.{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}}
