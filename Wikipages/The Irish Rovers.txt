'''The Irish Rovers''' is a group of Irish musicians that originated in Toronto, Canada. Formed in 1963 named after the traditional song "[[The Irish Rover]]" they are best known for their international television series, contributing to the popularisation of [[Irish Music]] in North America, and for the songs "[[The Unicorn (song)|The Unicorn]]", "[[Drunken Sailor]]", "Wasn't That a Party", "[[The Orange and the Green]]", "[[Whiskey on a Sunday (song)|Whiskey on a Sunday]]", "[[Lily the Pink (song)|Lily the Pink]]" and "[[The Black Velvet Band]]".

The primary voices heard in the group's early songs were [[Will Millar]] (tenor), [[Jimmy Ferguson]] (baritone), [[George Millar (singer)|George Millar]] and Joe Millar, and in the last twenty years, also John Reynolds and Ian Millar. Wilcil McDowell's accordion has been a signature sound of the band throughout their more than fifty years.

Founding member George Millar and his cousin Ian are both from [[Ballymena]], Davey Walker from Armagh, Sean O'Driscoll from [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Gerry O'Connor (fiddle player)|Gerry O'Connor]] from Dundalk, with Morris Crum from Carnlough and percussionist Fred Graham from Belfast.<ref name="maui scot">{{Cite web |title=Irish Rovers back home in Northern Ireland to make DVD |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/news/irish-rovers-back-home-in-northern-ireland-to-make-dvd-14947629.html |website=Belfast Telegraph, 2010 |publisher=Belfast Telegraph Northern Ireland}}</ref> Flute and whistle player [[Geoffrey Kelly]] was born in [[Dumfries, Scotland|Dumfries]], Scotland.

In the 1980s, the group briefly renamed itself '''The Rovers'''. During this period, their "Wasn't That a Party" led to crossover success in the country rock genre.

The Irish Rovers have represented Canada at five [[World's fair|World Expos]], and in 2018 were honoured as one of Ireland's greatest exports at Dublin, Ireland's [[EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum]].

==History==

===Northern Ireland===
The brothers [[George Millar (singer)|George Millar]] and [[Will Millar]] were both born in [[Ballymena]], County Antrim, Northern Ireland.<ref>He was 16 in 1963, according to [http://theirishroversmusic.com/ the band's official net-site].</ref> The children grew up in a musical household as their father Bob played button-key accordion for several bands throughout the years. Their cousin Joe Millar, who also sang, took part in the family kitchen parties playing button-key accordion and harmonica. As children, George and Will performed with their sister, [[Sandra Beech]] as "The Millar Kids" in Ireland, before the family emigrated to Canada.

===Early years===
In 1963, George met fellow Irish native [[Jimmy Ferguson]] at an Irish function in [[Toronto]]. They sang together until dawn, and founded the Irish Rovers. According to a Calgary Herald article in 1971, "George and Jimmy formed the first Irish Rovers for an amateur variety show in Toronto and won."

George's cousin, Joe also soon emigrated to Toronto and was recruited as he stepped off the plane.

The name "The Irish Rovers" was suggested by George's mother. The traditional Irish song about a sailing ship had been a favourite from their kitchen parties in Ballymena. For a short time, George, Jimmy and Joe were joined by Vic Marcus and Doug Henderson. George's father, Bob, became The Irish Rovers's first manager booking the new band at folk song festivals, clubs, hootenannies and The Port o' Call.<ref name="Jjfahrni">'Irish Rovers are Digging out those old Folk songs', By Ballymena Weekly Editor, Ballymena Weekly Telegraph, N. Ireland – 20 August 1964</ref> According to a 1964 newspaper in the Millars' home town in Ireland, "The folk singing 'boom' in the United States and Canada proved profitable for three young Ballymena men who form the nucleus of a popular, Toronto-based group who call themselves 'The Irish Rovers.'”

In the early 60s, [[Will Millar]] and his friend Brian Evans performed in a Toronto Calypso group, The Kalypso Kews. After moving to Calgary, Will formed a folk trio in Calgary along with another Ulster native, Derek Swinson. He also developed quite a following singing at Phil's Pancake House, and then landing a job singing on Calgary's ''Just 4 Fun'', a local TV show for children.

In 1964, after more than six months performing in the Toronto area, George and Jimmy left to visit Will in Calgary. In 1979, Jimmy told ''Canadian Music Magazine'', "We actually formed the group in Toronto. I sang, George played guitar and at that time Joe was playing a little button key accordion. We were ambitious in those days, we'd played the clubs to death in Toronto and we didn't know what to do next; what direction to take. So we decided to visit Will in Calgary, ended up staying there, and the Irish Rovers became four. "".<ref>{{Cite news |year=1979 |title='The Irish Rovers', Canadian Music Magazine}}</ref> Joe moved his family out from Toronto, and the band continued in Calgary.

George was enrolled in a local Calgary high school and Jimmy worked at a local Calgary slaughter house. Jimmy's job would last but a few hours. George soon quit school and Will's home became the new home base for the band.

The Irish Rovers became regulars at Calgary's Depression Coffeehouse, a folk club operated by John Uren that also contributed to the start of [[Joni Mitchell]]'s career.

==="US America"===
Will introduced the group to his manager Les Weinstein who became the band's full-time manager, while Will became the band leader.

The Rovers drove to California in 1966, hoping to perform in the folk clubs there. On the way, their car broke down near an Italian restaurant owned by two Irish immigrants in northern California. The boys were given room and board and an introduction to Jan Brainerd, a booking agent who helped them secure an appearance at [[The Purple Onion]] in San Francisco where they played sold-out houses for five months. The group was then booked at other folk clubs across California.

In 1966, the Rovers signed a recording contract with [[Decca Records]] with [[Charles "Bud" Dant|Charles Dant]] and recorded their first album, ''[[The First of the Irish Rovers]],'' at The Ice House in Pasadena. The album was successful enough to warrant another album, which included their first hit, which was from a song originally written and recorded in 1962 by [[Shel Silverstein]], ''[[The Unicorn (song)|The Unicorn]].'' [[Glen Campbell]] played guitar on the original recording.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Rockingham |first=Graham |date=11 March 2011 |title=From pub-dom to international stardom |work=Hamilton Spectator |url=http://www.thespec.com/whatson/music/article/498869--from-pub-dom-to-international-stardom}}</ref> After recording the album, Joe left the band for a more "reliable" income for a family man. It was at this time that they invited All-Ireland Champion Wilcil McDowell to join the band. After the success of "The Unicorn", Joe returned to the band. The album included the Irish tunes "[[The Orange and the Green]]" and "[[The Black Velvet Band]]". Wilcil's accordion has continued to be a signature sound of the band.

Starting in the late 60s, the Irish Rovers performed on various North American television programs including several appearances on the TV western ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]],'' as well as ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]],'' ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]],'' ''[[The Dating Game]],'' ''[[The Pig And Whistle]],'' and ''[[The Beachcombers]].''

In 1968, they were named "Folk Group of the Year" by the predecessor of the [[JUNO Award]]s, and in 1969 they received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for "Folk Performance of the Year".

===The Rovers Era===
In the early 1980s, the group adjusted its style and began aiming itself towards the country-rock field. Renamed The Rovers, the group scored a major international hit with "Wasn't That a Party" and also found success with the Christmas novelty recording "Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer". By the late 1980s, however, the group had reverted to their original Irish Rovers branding.

===Television===
In 1971, The Irish Rovers were offered their own CBC-produced television series, ''The Irish Rovers Show''.<ref name="Inc.1972">{{Cite journal |last=Bennett |first=Michael |date=30 September 1972 |title=Western Canada:Activity abounds on all fronts |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YUUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA48 |pages=48– |issn=0006-2510 |work=Billboard}}</ref> While entertaining a family audience, the show promoted Ireland and Irish music to North Americans. Guest stars included their friends [[The Clancy Brothers]] and [[Tommy Makem]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Carl Perkins]], [[Bobby Darin]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[Vera Lynn]] and [[Anne Murray]]. Visits from [[Shari Lewis]] and her puppets, including [[Lamb Chop (puppet)|Lamb Chop]], were audience favourites. There were regularly taped visits to Northern and Southern Ireland, Scotland, England, New Zealand, P.E.I., Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Banff and even Alert – at the tip of Ellesmere Island – the farthest, northerly inhabited base in the world.<ref>{{Cite news |date=25 February 1978 |title='They're Not Stars, They're Friends' by Jeani Read |work=TV Guide}}</ref>

"The Irish Rovers Show" ran for 7 years, winning an [[ACTRA Award]] for Best Variety Performance.  Brothers Will and George Millar co-wrote the majority of their original Irish compositions. Producer and Director [[Ken Gibson (producer)|Ken Gibson]] and [[Michael Watt (director)|Michael Watt]] often hosted special effects technicians from L.A. who were learning the new green screen technology, which were used for comedic leprechaun segments featuring Will, George and Jimmy, and is later used in ''The Mother Goose Video Treasury'' in 1987. The Rovers then continued with another television series on the [[Global Television Network]] in conjunction with [[Ulster Television]] in Ireland.

Although most of their music focuses on the band's Irish roots, in the early 1980s The Irish Rovers recorded an unknown novelty Christmas song written by Randy Brooks. Record producer [[Jack Richardson (record producer)|Jack Richardson]] produced The Rovers' album, ''It Was A Night Like This.'' The single release of "[[Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer]]" rose to the top 20 in Canada within a week of airplay.<ref>{{Cite news |date=11 December 2011 |title=Rovers release holiday songs |work=Nanaimo News bulletin |url=http://www.nanaimobulletin.com/entertainment/135618323.html |access-date=14 May 2012}}</ref> Exposure of the music on television also added to the popularity of their music.

In 1980, their crossover hit recording of [[Tom Paxton]]'s "Wasn't That a Party", which was inspired by the boys' own after-show partying, put them at the top of the charts again. In 1981, the group starred in their second Canadian TV series: ''The Rovers Comedy House,'' a seven-part CBC series of comedy and boisterous Irish music produced by Ken Gibson. For most of the 1980s the band was known as "The Rovers" and followed up hits with songs such as "[[Chattanoogie Shoe Shine Boy]]" and "No More Bread and Butter".

Their third television series, ''Party with the Rovers,'' ran from 1984 to 1986 with [[Jack Richardson (record producer)|Jack Richardson]] as Musical Director and Ken Gibson as Executive Producer. The show was set in a traditional pub setting featuring music sessions with the band performing together with [[Liam Clancy]], [[Tommy Makem]], [[John Allan Cameron]], [[Kenny Rogers]], [[Lonnie Donegan]], [[Andy Gibb]], [[Rita Coolidge]], [[Ronnie Prophet]], and many others. The series was produced for [[Global Television Network|Global]] in conjunction with [[Ulster Television]] in Ireland, and was syndicated around the world.

The band members became Canadian citizens after Canada's Prime Minister, [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau]], asked them to do so, to officially represent Canada around the world. By 1989 they had represented Canada at five world Expos: Montreal (1967), Osaka, Japan (1970), Okinawa, Japan (1976), Vancouver (1986), and Brisbane, Australia (1988). In recognition of their quarter century of contributions of Canadian music to the International music world, they were awarded Canada's top music honour, the Performing Rights Organization's (PROCAN) Harold Moon Award. With their double album ''25th Anniversary Collection'' in 1989, which featured the backing of [[The Chieftains]] and songs written by, amongst others, [[Randy Bachman]], Bryan Adams and [[Jim Vallance]], the band was, once again, officially known as The Irish Rovers, but many fans still refer to them as The Rovers.

Will announced his departure in 1994 and has become a successful artist focusing on the Ireland of old as a favourite subject matter. Upon departure, George replaced him as bandleader and hired fellow musicians John Reynolds and Wallace Hood.

After a court battle for the name of "The Irish Rovers", the full band continued to tour, then filmed the video "The Irish Rovers, Live and Well", plus the CD, 'Celtic Collection: The Next Thirty Years'. Over the following two years they followed up with two more albums, "Gems", and "Come Fill Up Your Glasses". While the band was on tour in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] in October 1997, Jimmy Ferguson died of a heart attack.

For a return to television in 2011, the band filmed the television special, ''The Irish Rovers, Home in Ireland.'' Locations for the special included [[Dunluce Castle]], [[Carnlough]] Harbour, [[Portglenone]], and various spots along the northeast coast of Northern Ireland. The show was transmitted in 2011 and 2012 across the PBS Network in North America.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Ken |first=Kelly |date=12 December 2011 |title=Have a merry time with The Irish Rovers |work=Music Nerd Chronicles |url=http://musicnerd.ca/2011/12/have-a-merry-time-with-the-irish-rovers/}}</ref>

In 2012 ''The Irish Rovers Christmas'' television special, which was filmed at various locations in [[Banff National Park]], [[Sunshine Village]] and [[Chatham-Kent]]'s Capitol Theatre, was shown across the PBS Network throughout the US and Canada and was broadcast in New Zealand on Sky TV.

In 2015 The Rovers filmed their own 50th Anniversary LIVE on St. Patrick's Day concert in [[Nanaimo]], Canada. [[Shaw Communications]] also filmed behind the scenes at the event for a music documentary titled "The Irish Rovers 50th Anniversary Special". It was broadcast nationally in Canada on SHAW Video on Demand in 2015 and 2016.

The two-DVD set "LIVE on St. Patrick's Day" which was filmed at The Port Theatre on Vancouver Island and Lismore, Ireland, was released in 2017. All three television specials were released on DVD and may be rebroadcast during the holiday seasons.

===Rover Records and touring===
The band continued to tour and record. Joe Millar retired from the band in 2005 when his son, Ian Millar, took up the family ranks. Joe and Ian performed once together on stage before Ian took over his father's spot.

The present line-up of [[George Millar (singer)|George Millar]], Wilcil McDowell, Ian Millar, Sean O'Driscoll, Fred Graham, Morris Crum, [[Geoffrey Kelly]] and [[Gerry O'Connor (fiddle player)|Gerry O'Connor]] continues to tour Canada, the United States, Australia and New Zealand.

In 1993 the band formed their own record company, Rover Records, which allowed them artistic freedom that as a younger band they could not afford. George Millar continues to write songs for the band, with Rover Records producing their last sixteen albums including ''Celtic Collection,'' ''Come Fill Up Your Glasses,'' ''Down by the Lagan Side,'' ''[[Still Rovin' After All These Years]],'' and their Greatest Hits albums, ''40 Years a-Rovin','' and ''The Irish Rovers's Gems.'' Their Irish homeland continues to be the primary subject of their music, as in "Erin's Green Isle", "I'll Return", "Dear Little Shamrock Shore", "[[Dunluce Castle]]", "Home to [[Bantry Bay]]", "The [[Dublin]] Pub Crawl", and "[[Gracehill Fair]]". Recently, their recording of "[[Drunken Sailor]]" reached a younger audience on YouTube.

In 2010, The Irish Rovers marked their 45th anniversary with the release of the CD ''Gracehill Fair,'' which won a local music award on their home base of Vancouver Island.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Irish Rovers win SOCAN song award at 2011 VIMAs |url=http://www.socan.ca/jsp/en/pub/news_events/VIMA2011Report.jsp |access-date=30 June 2011 |publisher=SOCAN, Canada}}</ref>

The band returned to the World Music charts in 2011 with their album, ''Home in Ireland.''

In 2012, their single, "The Titanic", released from their ''Drunken Sailor'' album, focused attention on Belfast and the [[Harland and Wolff]] shipyard that had built the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'' a century before.<ref>{{Cite news |date=22 February 2012 |title=Video: Irish Rovers release Titanic tribute song |work=The Belfast Telegraph |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/news/video-irish-rovers-release-titanic-tribute-song-16121007.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=24 February 2012 |title=Irish Rovers return with Titanic tribute |work=Belfast News Letter |url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/local/irish-rovers-return-with-titanic-tribute-1-3557071 |access-date=4 May 2012}}</ref> After the song, and accompanying video made headlines in Belfast, N. Ireland, it was also featured in a Canadian documentary for the CBC which aided in returning the credit of building the ship to the Northern Ireland shipyards of [[Belfast]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ormiston |first=Susan |title=The Pride of Belfast |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeS9MlqQ2Qk |access-date=3 April 2012 |publisher=CBC, The National |format=video}}</ref> The album was produced in response to YouTube activity.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Ferguson |first=Jon |date=8 March 2012 |title=Intelligencer Journal – Irish Rovers inspired by tradition – and YouTube |work=Intelligencer Journal |url=http://lancasteronline.com/article/local/601101_Irish-Rovers-inspired-by-tradition----and-YouTube.html |access-date=14 May 2012}}</ref>

The band slowed down their touring schedule in their fiftieth year. The release of ''The Irish Rovers, 50 Years'' compilation album supported their Farewell To Rovin' Tour which will take a few years to complete.<ref>{{Cite news |date=October 2013 |title=Video: Irish Rovers say respect kept them together for 50 years |work=Toronto Star |url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2013/10/03/irish_rovers_say_respect_kept_them_together_for_50_years.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=2 October 2013 |title=Wasn't that a party: Irish Rovers launch one last global tour from the Rock |work=Times Colonist |url=http://www.timescolonist.com/entertainment/wasn-t-that-a-party-irish-rovers-launch-one-last-global-tour-from-the-rock-1.646582}}</ref> In 2018, Wilcil McDowell retired from touring and keyboardist Morris Crum replaced him, leaving George Millar as the only remaining current member tied to the 1960s lineup.

After the long tours are done, the band intends to continue recording and performing for special events.
