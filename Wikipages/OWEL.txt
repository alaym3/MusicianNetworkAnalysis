'''OWEL''' is an alternative indie rock band formed in Woodbridge, NJ in late 2012. The band currently consists of Jay Sakong (lead vocal, guitar, keys), Nunzio Moudatsos (bass, vocals), Seamus O'Connor (guitar, keys, vocals), Jane Park (violin, viola, keys, vocals), and Ryan Vargas (percussion).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.equalvision.com/artists/owel/|title = OWEL}}</ref> The band signed to [[Equal Vision Records]] in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chorus.fm/news/owel-sign-with-equal-vision-records/|title = Owel Sign with Equal Vision Records}}</ref> According to lead singer Jay Sakong in an Instagram livestream, there is no meaning behind the band's name and it is supposed to be seen as just a name.

OWEL is known for incorporating orchestral elements into their alternative rock sound.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
The band began in late 2012 as a reincarnation of another group which included lead singer/guitarist Jay Sakong and percussionist Ryan Vargas who both attended the same high school in Woodbridge, NJ. Sakong later met guitarist/keyboardist Seamus O'Connor while both attended the Institute of Audio Research in New York City. Violinist/keyboardist Jane Park, a childhood friend of Sakong's, would eventually join the group which would later become OWEL. Bassist Nunzio Moudatsos, another high school friend of Sakong and Vargas, would join the band in 2015 after several member changes.{{Quote|text=I knew everyone from different points of my life. Jane since I was a kid, Ryan and Nunzio from high school, and I took an audio engineering course with Seamus. When I was thinking about putting together a group of people to play music with I just thought of the people that were already in my life that I thought would be fun to work with.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thepreludepress.com/interviews/2015/3/27/qa-with-jay-sakong-of-owel-1|title=Q&A with Jay Sakong of OWEL &#124; Prelude Press}}</ref>}}
