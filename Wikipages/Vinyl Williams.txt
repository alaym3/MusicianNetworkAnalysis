''The Guardian'' gave the album a positive 4 out of 5 rating,<ref name=hann/> while ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' critic Patric Fallon said, "Lionel 'Vinyl' Williams' retro-obsessed psych-pop is obscured in lo-fi tape hiss, riddled with microphone distortions, and sounds as if it was crafted purely from the dust lifted off of Can records. His wavering voice floats inside gobs of delay and reverb, constantly changing tone and pitch amidst the thick smoke of smoldering synth tones and destroyed guitar strums".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14484-higher-worlds/ |title=Vinyl Williams: "Higher Worlds" &#124; Tracks |publisher=Pitchfork |date=2012-10-23 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>
 
Vinyl Williams was interviewed by ''[[Dazed & Confused (magazine)|Dazed & Confused]]'' in October 2012, and contributed original art to the article.<ref name="dazeddigital1">{{cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/14932/1/vinyl-williamss-whoa-art |title=Vinyl Williams's "WHOA!" art |publisher=Dazed Digital |date=2011-10-21 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>

No Pain in Pop released the "Stellarscope" single on March 1, 2013, including a Europa51 remix featuring ex-[[Stereolab]] member [[Andy Ramsay]].<ref>[http://nopaininpop.com/vinyl-williams-stellarscope-interactive-music-video-remix/]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619112312/http://nopaininpop.com/vinyl-williams-stellarscope-interactive-music-video-remix/ |date=2013-06-19 }}</ref> Williams and Arefkia created an interactive music video to coincide with the release, which premiered the same day on ''[[Dazed Digital]]''. Williams said: "'Stellarscope' is an interactive environment. It's meant to be explored as a generative process - in other words you create the visuals by wandering throughout. Certain objects have sounds that emanate out of them (rainforest sounds in the jungle, ambient drones out of celestial tree disks, low drones out of the ending chalice) which are in congruency with the actual song. If you can make into a close proximity to those objects during the duration of the song, in a sense you can jam with it. It's supposed to allow navigation into a visual and sonic improvisational world. There is no interface or goal, it's really about exploring, and ultimately a test of digital dexterity. It appears to be a little difficult to navigate through a space jungle kingdom built on seamless stream-of-consciousness."<ref name="dazeddigital">{{cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/15761/1/vinyl-williamss-stellarscope-a-v-experience |title=Vinyl Williams's Stellarscope A/V Experience |website=Dazeddigital.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-16}}</ref>

While in [[Seoul]], South Korea, Williams met with Chaz Bundick of [[Toro y Moi]] and the two decided to collaborate on a conceptual, interactive record combining music and visuals; ''Trance Zen Dental Spa'' was released as a free digital EP on December 10, 2014 by Bundick's Company Records. Williams explained: "The most conceptually-intact way for this project to exist is as a digital form. It's about issues of simulated phenomena that ultimately end up as choose-your-own-adventure hypnotism".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://blog.bittorrent.com/2014/12/09/vinyl-williams-and-chaz-bundick-trance-zen-dental-spa/?shareadraft=baba5674_54860bfeba8b9 | location=London | work=bittorrent blog| title=Vinyl Williams and Chaz Bundick: Trance Zen Dental Spa | date=2014-12-10}}</ref>
