==History==
Leathermouth was formed in 2007 by some friends of [[My Chemical Romance]]'s rhythm guitarist [[Frank Iero]].<ref name="epitaph-bio"/> Iero had heard a few demo tracks from the band, and wanted to sign the band to his own independent label, Skeleton Crew. It was not until the previous lead singer had failed to write any lyrics that Iero became a member.<ref name="mtv-bummed out"/> He uses the band as a way to vent the frustrations he has with the current political and social climate; he has additionally stated that writing the lyrics was a way for him to cope with anxiety and depression he had felt during his life, with some of the songs written before the band had even formed. <ref name="mtv-bummed out">Harris, Chris.

Iero thought that it would be difficult to promote the album himself, if released through his own label, with his current obligations to My Chemical Romance and the other bands signed to his label. Epitaph Records president, [[Brett Gurewitz]], was impressed with the band's "intensity and songwriting of the music."<ref>[http://hangout.altsounds.com/news/104721-epitaph-to-release-leathermouth-debut-album-26th-january-2009-a.html "Epitaph to Release Leathermouth Debut Album 26th January 2009"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123085656/http://hangout.altsounds.com/news/104721-epitaph-to-release-leathermouth-debut-album-26th-january-2009-a.html |date=January 23, 2009 }} ''Altsounds''.

In a 2012 interview with Iero, he revealed that many of the other band members turned to religion and decided not to be a part of Leathermouth anymore. Iero also stated he would like to continue Leathermouth, but is unsure if it will actually happen. He said, "There's still part of me that would hate not doing that band again. There's something brewing, but I don't know what it is. I really wanted that band to go on longer, but Jesus had other plans."<ref>{{cite web| last = Pettigrew| first = Jason| title = Flavor Of The Bleak: A brief Q&A with My Chemical Romance's Frank Iero| work = [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]| date = October 1, 2012| url = http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/flavor_of_the_bleak_a_brief_qa_with_my_chemical_romances_frank_iero| accessdate = October 1, 2012}}</ref>
