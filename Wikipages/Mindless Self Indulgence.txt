'''Mindless Self Indulgence''' (often shortened to '''MSI''') is an American [[electropunk]] band formed in [[New York City]] in 1997. Their music has a mixed style which includes [[punk rock]], [[alternative rock]], [[electronica]], [[techno]], [[Industrial music|industrial]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[breakbeat hardcore]].

==History==
Between 1987 and 1996, [[Jimmy Urine]] recorded about 35 songs which varied in musical style, usually settling in an industrial/electronic punk style. These songs were recorded with himself and his brother, Markus Euringer in New York City using rudimentary equipment. Urine and his brother released an album titled ''Mindless Self-Indulgence'', featuring Steve, Righ?, on 'Bed of Roses', which featured songs performed in an industrial style akin to [[Nine Inch Nails]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Mindless-Self-Indulgence-Mindless-Self-Indulgence/release/262775 |title=Mindless Self-Indulgence* – Mindless Self-Indulgence (1995, CD) |website=Discogs.com |access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>

According to the band's website, their first live concert was on November 5, 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mindlessselfindulgence.com/tour/downtime-new-york-ny-11-05-1998/ |title=Downtime, New York, NY, 11/05/1998 |website=Mindlessselfindulgence.com |date=1998-11-05 |access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>

In 1997, Urine recorded a cover of [[Method Man]]'s "Bring the Pain" that was made by merging six different styles of the same cover into one song. This became the basis for the Mindless Self Indulgence sound. Shortly after, the current band was formed when Jimmy Urine was joined by Steve, Righ? on guitar, Urine's brother Markus Euringer on second guitar (replaced by bassist Vanessa Y.T., who was subsequently replaced by bassist Lyn-Z), and Urine's cousin<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elftown.com/_Mindless%20Facts |title=Mindless Facts |publisher=Elftown.com |access-date=2014-02-28}}</ref> Kitty on drums. They have released six albums, four EPs, eight remix albums, one live album, one compilation album, and one live DVD.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/51619-Mindless-Self-Indulgence?limit=500&page=1 |title=Mindless Self Indulgence Discography |website=discogs.com |access-date=2021-06-27}}</ref> Rather than signing traditional record contracts, the band has licensed most of their albums to record labels, retaining ownership of the music.

In summer of 2007, the band toured as part of the Revolution Stage of [[Projekt Revolution]], a music festival hosted by [[Linkin Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://linkinpedia.com/index.php?title=Projekt_Revolution_2007 |title=Projekt Revolution 2007 |website=Linkinpedia.com |access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref> In January 2009, the band headlined the [[Kerrang!]] Relentless Energy Drink tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1302301/kerrang-tour-returns-in-2009 |title=Kerrang!

In December 2010, they released a comic titled ''Adventures Into Mindless Self Indulgence'' about various tour stories and significant moments of the band's career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=29278 |title=Mindless Self Indulgence to Sign New Book at Two West Coast Events |date=6 November 2010 |publisher=Comic Book Resources |access-date=2012-07-03}}</ref> The band released a remastered CD/DVD version of their first full-length album, ''[[Tight (Mindless Self Indulgence album)|Tight]]'', in 2011, titled ''Tighter''. It included bonus tracks and recordings from their early days. On October 25, 2012, the band announced their fifth album via a [[Kickstarter]] campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1268472090/brand-new-mindless-self-indulgence-record|title=Brand New Mindless Self Indulgence Record!|publisher=[[Kickstarter]]|author=Mindless Self Indulgence|date=2012-10-25 |access-date=2012-10-26}}</ref> ''[[How I Learned to Stop Giving a Shit and Love Mindless Self Indulgence]]'' was released in May 2013, following with the release of singles "It Gets Worse" in December and "Fuck Machine" in January 2014.

On September 18, 2015, Mindless Self Indulgence released ''Pink'', a collection of 19 songs recorded between 1990 and 1997 by Urine. The album includes cut-down and remastered versions of songs from the self-titled album, an audio diary recorded by Urine from July 1992, and covers of [[Depeche Mode]]'s "Personal Jesus" and [[Duran Duran]]'s "Girls on Film".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mindlessselfindulgence.com/news/pink/ |title=The Msi Historical Society Presents: "Pink" |publisher=Mindlessselfindulgence.com |date=2015-06-25 |access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>

=== Sexual assault allegations against Jimmy Urine ===
On August 9, 2021 a lawsuit was filed against James Euringer (Jimmy Urine) in New York Supreme Court with the charge of sexual battery of a minor. In the suit, the accuser, whose identity was left anonymous because she was a minor at the time, claims that she had a sexual relationship with Euringer for over two years — from January 1997 to June 1999 — starting when she was 15 years old and Euringer was 27. Euringer, the suit alleges, "groomed and manipulated [her] into believing that his sexually assaultive behavior was not criminal and that by engaging in sexual activity with him Plaintiff was actually helping to protect younger girls from sexual assaults." Euringer knew the accuser was a minor, according to the suit, having at one point written her a letter wishing her a happy fifteenth birthday. "During this time, Euringer acted as and treated Plaintiff as though she was his girlfriend and the two were in a consensual relationship," says the suit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/mindless-self-indulgence-frontman-jimmy-urine-sued-for-sexual-assault-of-minor-3015167|title=Mindless Self Indulgence frontman Jimmy Urine sued for sexual assault of minor|date=10 August 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wmleader.com/entertainment/138704/mindless-self-indulgence-singer-jimmy-urine-sued-over-alleged-sexual-relationship-with-15-year-old/|title=Mindless Self Indulgence Singer Jimmy Urine Sued over Alleged Sexual Relationship with 15-Year-Old}}</ref>

According to the lawsuit, it is alleged that throughout the relationship, Euringer took pictures of the plaintiff naked and requested that she "act like a small child, suck her thumb, drool, and pee in her pants," during sexual acts. Euringer also allegedly bought the accuser a fake ID so she could go to concerts with him and drink alcohol. Euringer allegedly tried to hide their relationship by telling her not to act affectionately with him while in public. The lawsuit claims that the woman has suffered emotional distress since the relationship started.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Millman|first=Ethan|date=2021-08-09|title=Mindless Self Indulgence Singer Jimmy Urine Sued for Sexual Assault of Minor|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/mindless-self-indulgence-jimmy-urine-sexual-assault-1209677/|access-date=2021-08-09|magazine=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.mxdwn.com/2021/08/09/news/jimmy-urine-of-mindless-self-indulgence-sued-for-alleged-sexual-battery-of-a-minor-in-the-late-90s/|title = Jimmy Urine of Mindless Self Indulgence Sued for Alleged Sexual Battery of a Minor in the Late '90s -|date = 9 August 2021}}</ref>
