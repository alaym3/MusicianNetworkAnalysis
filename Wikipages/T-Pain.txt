'''Faheem Rasheed Najm''' (born September 30, 1984),<ref name="carter2014factfiction" /> better known by his stage name '''T-Pain''', is an American rapper, singer, songwriter and record producer. Throughout his career as a singer, T-Pain popularized the creative use of the [[Auto-Tune]] [[pitch correction]] effect, used with extreme parameter settings to create distinctive vocal sounds. His success with the effect has influenced several other major artists to adopt it as well, namely [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Lil Wayne]], [[Kanye West]], [[Future (rapper)|Future]] and [[Travis Scott]], among others. After signing with American singer [[Akon]]’s [[Konvict Kartel|Konvict Muzik]], T-Pain subsequently founded his own [[vanity label]] imprint, [[Nappy Boy Entertainment]], established in 2005.

His debut album, ''[[Rappa Ternt Sanga]]'', was released in 2005. In 2007, T-Pain released his second album, ''[[Epiphany (T-Pain album)|Epiphany]]'', which reached number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. His third album, ''[[Three Ringz]]'', was released in 2008. The albums included a string of [[hit single]]s, including "[[I'm Sprung]]", "[[I'm 'n Luv (Wit a Stripper)]]", "[[Buy U a Drank (Shawty Snappin')]]", "[[Bartender (T-Pain song)|Bartender]]", "[[Can't Believe It (T-Pain song)|Can't Believe It]]", and "[[5 O'Clock (T-Pain song)|5 O'Clock]]". T-Pain has earned two [[Grammy Award]]s from 12 nominations, one with [[Kanye West]] for "[[Good Life (Kanye West song)|Good Life]]" and the other with [[Jamie Foxx]] for "[[Blame It]]". From 2006 to 2010, T-Pain was featured on more than 50 chart topping singles. His most successful feature to date was on [[Flo Rida]]'s debut single "[[Low (Flo Rida song)|Low]]", which has since been certified [[List of music recording certifications#Digital download singles|diamond (10x platinum)]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).

Speaking in May 2007 to noted UK R&B writer Pete Lewis, of the award-winning [[Blues & Soul]] about his reason for naming his second album 'Epiphany', T-Pain stated: "One of the two dictionary meanings of epiphany is 'a sudden moment of insight or revelation'. And to me the title 'Epiphany' signifies the moment I realized that, to make the best music I can, I needed to just go in the studio and be myself, and not concentrate so hard on following other people's formulas."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/238/no_pain_no_gain/ |title=T-Pain interview|publisher=Bluesandsoul.com |date=February 2008 |access-date=November 1, 2011}}</ref>

== Legal issues ==
*On April 28, 2007, T-Pain refused to shorten his performance at [[Radio One (company)|Radio One]]'s Spring Fest Concert in [[Miami]], which caused police presence to escalate backstage. He became agitated after concert officials stopped his performance of "Buy U a Drank (Shawty Snappin')". Police chased him and his entourage out of the premises and detained them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.5184/title.t-pain-arrested|title=T-Pain Arrested|last=Springer|first=Anthony Jr.|date=May 1, 2007|work=HipHopDX|access-date=July 27, 2009}}</ref>
