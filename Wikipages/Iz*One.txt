The initiative raised ₩1,000,000,000 (roughly US$900,000), its funding goal, but despite the support from the entire WIZ*ONE community, the initiative failed, and Iz*One disbanded as planned.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-04-22|title=IZ*ONE fans raise US$2million in hopes of keeping the group from disbanding|url=https://www.nme.com/en_asia/news/music/izone-fans-raise-usd-2million-keep-group-from-disbanding-2925545|access-date=2021-05-02|website=NME|language=en|archive-date=August 26, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210826064339/https://www.nme.com/en_asia/news/music/izone-fans-raise-usd-2million-keep-group-from-disbanding-2925545|url-status=live}}</ref>
