'''Zodiac''' (Zodiak, {{lang-ru|Зодиа́к}}, {{lang-lv|Zodiaks}}) was a [[space disco]] music band that existed in the 1980s in [[Latvia]], then a part of [[Soviet Union]]. The band was extremely popular in the Soviet Union and has been credited by critics as the Soviet answer to the [[France|French]] band [[Space (electronic band)|Space]] who were popular at the time.

==Biography==

Zodiac was formed by Jānis Lūsēns, then studying [[musical composition|composition]] at the [[Latvian State Conservatory]] in [[Riga]] (now [[Jāzeps Vītols Latvian Academy of Music]]). The other four members of the group were also students of various faculties of the same conservatory.

Zodiac's first [[vinyl record]] ''Disco Alliance'' (Russian: Диско альянс, Latvian: Disko alianse) was released in 1980 on the [[Monopoly|monopolist]] [[Melodiya]] [[Record label|label]], during the band members' studentship. The album was produced by [[Aleksandrs Grīva]], who was also the father of band member Zane Grīva. The music featured a lot of then-unusual [[synthesizer|synthesized]] sounds and effects together with more conventional [[euro disco]] elements.

The second album ''Music in the Universe'' ({{lang-ru|Музыка во Вселенной}}) released two years later was much inspired by a meeting with [[cosmonaut]]s in the [[Star City, Moscow]] and their tales about space flights. The music of the second album was much more [[rock music|rock]]-influenced than the first.

During that time the band also performed the music of [[Viktor Vlasov (composer)|Viktor Vlasov]] for the films ''Женские радости и печали'' (''Woman's Joys and Sorrows'', 1982) and ''Экипаж машины боевой'' (''The Tank Crew'', 1983), the [[soundtrack]]s for both films were released on a [[vinyl record]] ''Music from the Films'' ({{lang-ru|Музыка из кинофильмов}}) in 1985. The music of the group was also used in the [[documentary film]] about the cosmonaut artist [[Alexei Leonov]] ''Звёздная палитра'' (''Star Palette'', 1982).

The album ''In memoriam'' was composed and produced by Jānis Lūsēns alone and released in 1989. The album was dedicated to the ancient and modern cultural and natural heritage of [[Latvia]]. The sounding of the album turned from disco to light [[techno]]/[[synthpop]] while gaining a lot of [[european classical music|classical music]] influences as well as the influence of [[Jean Michel Jarre]]'s [[ambient music|ambient]] works.

The last album ''Clouds'' was released in 1991 by RiTonis (former [[Melodiya]]). It contains a hit song of the early 1990s in [[Latvia]] "My favourite flowers".

''Disco Alliance'' and ''Music in the Universe'' were released together on [[compact disc]] by [[Mikrofona Ieraksti]] (which represents [[EMI]] in the [[Baltic states]]).

In the early 2000s, the Russian electronic duo [[PPK (group)|PPK]] recorded a remix of Zodiac's composition "Zodiac" from the ''Disco Alliance'' album. This remix, titled "Reload", entered the charts in a number of territories. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}
