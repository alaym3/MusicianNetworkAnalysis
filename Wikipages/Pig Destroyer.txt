'''Pig Destroyer''' is an American [[grindcore]] band formed in 1997 in [[Alexandria, Virginia]].  The band was formed by vocalist J.R. Hayes, guitarist [[Scott Hull (musician)|Scott Hull]], and drummer John Evans. Throughout the band's earlier history, they were a three-piece group until sampler Blake Harrison joined in 2006, notably had no bassist until the inclusion of John Jarvis in 2013, and went through 2 past drummers with the role currently held by Adam Jarvis. Pig Destroyer is one of the most well-known grindcore bands in the genre due to Hayes's poetic lyrics,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/rpyamz/pig-destroyer-interview-2015|title=Pig Destroyer's Lyrical Genius J. R. Hayes Is Inspired by Death and Loves Fugazi - Noisey|work=Noisey.Vice.com|access-date=December 4, 2018}}</ref> Hull's incorporation of thrash, punk, and doom influences in songwriting, and technical drum work.

==Biography==
The band formed in 1997 after the break-up of a short-lived political [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]] band, Treblinka, with 2 former members of said band, vocalist J. R. Hayes ([[Enemy Soil (band)|Enemy Soil]]), guitarist [[Scott Hull (musician)|Scott Hull]] ([[Agoraphobic Nosebleed]], Japanese Torture Comedy Hour, ex-[[Anal Cunt]]), and drummer John Evans, who left the band for an unspecified school not long after the band's formation. After the departure of Evans, he was soon replaced by Brian Harvey.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/arts/music/article/13021457/face-it-youre-a-metal-band|title=Face It, You're a Metal Band - Washington City Paper|work=WashingtonCityPaper.com|date=12 January 2001}}</ref>

In an interview, Scott Hull claims that they picked the band name on the criteria that it was insulting, yet somewhat more creative than the name of his last band, Anal Cunt. Deciding that "Cop Killer" or "Cop Destroyer" would be tactless, they eventually settled on "Pig Destroyer" ("pig" being a pejorative [[United States|American]] [[slang]] term for the [[police]]). Derived from a non-musical source as extreme as the band's sound, Pig Destroyer's easily identifiable logo was created using a graphic from ''[[ANSWER Me!]]'' magazine as a template. 
[[Relapse Records]] signed the band and issued a split 7" with [[Isis (band)|Isis]] on the label's Singles Series in July 2000. ''[[38 Counts of Battery]]'' was a complete discography of Pig Destroyer releases up to the year 2000, which included split records with Gnob and influential [[screamo]] act [[Orchid (screamo band)|Orchid]], as well as their debut album, ''[[Explosions In Ward 6]]'', and the demo that secured their record deal.

''[[Prowler in the Yard]]'', released in 2001, was the first of the band's records to really break through to what could contextually be considered the "mainstream". Garnering rave reviews from popular press such as ''[[Kerrang!]]'' and ''[[Terrorizer Magazine|Terrorizer]]'', the record earned Pig Destroyer headlining slots at the 2002 [[New England Metal and Hardcore Festival]] and the 2002 Relapse Records CMJ Showcase, as well as a high placing at 2003's Relapse Contamination Fest alongside scene legends [[High on Fire]] and [[The Dillinger Escape Plan]] (documented on the Relapse Contamination Fest DVD).

2004's ''[[Terrifyer]]'' boasted a much clearer sound than ''Prowler in the Yard'' or ''38 Counts of Battery'', as well as lyrics and prose from Hayes. The record came with an accompanying DVD soundscape entitled "Natasha", which was intended to be listened to in [[surround sound]] (although a more recent Japanese edition of the album has "Natasha" as an ordinary CD with four bonus tracks). Session guitarist Matthew Kevin Mills, Hull's former guitar teacher, recorded the lead guitar parts in the song "Towering Flesh".

A compilation of tracks from the [[split EP]]s with Gnob and [[Benümb]] is also available, entitled ''[[Painter of Dead Girls]]''. The album features alternative versions of older songs from the ''38 Counts'' era (such as "Dark Satellites"), a series of new songs (such as "Rejection Fetish" and "Forgotten Child"), and covers of bands who could be considered an influence (such as [[The Stooges]] and [[Helmet (band)|Helmet]]).

Pig Destroyer have stated that they would release a series of 9 split 7" EPs in 2006. Bands on the flipside include [[Orthrelm]] and [[Blood Duster]]; however, nothing has yet been released. The 7" series was put on hold for the release of ''Phantom Limb''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=24046|title=Pig Destroyer Recording New Album|publisher=Metalunderground.com|access-date=12 October 2014}}</ref> Sampler Blake Harrison ([[Hatebeak]], Triac) joined prior to recording of the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blabbermouth.net//news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=66120|title=Pig Destroyer Begins Recording New Album - Blabbermouth.net|work=BLABBERMOUTH.NET|access-date=12 October 2014}}</ref>

2007 saw the release of album ''[[Phantom Limb (album)|Phantom Limb]]'' via [[Relapse Records]], complete with album artwork designed by John Baizley ([[Baroness (metal band)|Baroness]], [[Torche (band)|Torche]]).

In 2011, Harvey was replaced by [[Misery Index (band)|Misery Index]] drummer Adam Jarvis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theprp.com/2011/07/07/news/pig-destroyer-confirm-new-drummer/|title=Pig Destroyer Confirm New Drummer|work=Theprp.com - Metal And Hardcore News Plus Reviews And More|access-date=12 October 2014}}</ref>
