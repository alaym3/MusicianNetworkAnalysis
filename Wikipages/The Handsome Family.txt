==History==
Husband-and-wife duo Brett Sparks (vocals, guitar, keyboards) and Rennie Sparks (bass, banjo, vocals) formed the band in 1993, along with drummer Mike Werner.  The band would later revolve around Rennie, who writes the lyrics, and Brett, who writes the music.<ref>Doole, Kerry.

Regarding the band name, Brett said in an interview: "It's just kind of a stupid name. We used to have this really obnoxious drummer, and he used to call me 'Handsome', that was his nickname for me, I think for sarcastic reasons...  And he wanted to call it the Handsome Family... and we thought it was funny, too. We thought it was a good name."<ref>[http://www.triste.co.uk/handsome.htm The Handsome Family, The Triste Interview]. ''Triste''.</ref>

Brett is originally from [[Odessa, Texas|Odessa]], [[Texas]] and Rennie from [[Long Island]].<ref name="Layne">Layne, Joslyn "[{{Allmusic |class=artist |id=p200378| pure_url=yes}} The Handsome Family Biography]", ''[[Allmusic]]'', Macrovision Corporation</ref> The band toured extensively throughout both America and Europe in support of early releases ''[[Odessa (The Handsome Family album)|Odessa]]'' (1994) and ''[[Milk and Scissors]]'' (1996).<ref name="Strong" />  During that time, Brett suffered an emotional breakdown, resulting in his hospitalization and diagnosis of [[bipolar disorder]].<ref name= "Layne" />

They wrote their third full-length album, ''[[Through the Trees]]'', in the aftermath of these events, and included a song inspired by Brett's experiences in the psychiatric unit.<ref>Lyrics to "My Ghost", [http://www.handsomefamily.com/Nlyrics.html Handsome Family.]</ref>  They recorded the album in 1998, using [[Jeff Tweedy]]'s mobile studio,<ref name= "Strong" /> and brought the band to a wider audience.  ''[[Uncut (magazine) |UNCUT]]'' named it the "Best New Country Album of the Year".<ref name="Layne" />

A growing following and raised profile allowed Brett and Rennie to give up their day jobs and work on the band full-time. They toured America and Europe again in support of the 2000 album ''[[In the Air (The Handsome Family album)|In the Air]]''.<ref name="Layne" /> That year, Rennie's book of short stories, ''Evil'', was released by Chicago publisher Black Hole Press.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/rennie-sparks-ievili-6591|title=Review: Rennie Sparks: Evil|publisher=The A.V.

The duo appeared in the 2003 documentary ''[[Searching for the Wrong-Eyed Jesus]]'',<ref name=infoBox>{{cite news|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0389361/?ref_=ttfc_fc_tt| date=2014 |access-date=May 15, 2014 |title=''Searching for the Wrong-Eyed Jesus'' |publisher=IMDb}}</ref> as well as the soundtrack album released two years later.<ref name=meowgonSoundtrack>{{cite news|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/music-from-searching-for-the-wrong-eyed-jesus-mw0000208146| first=James | last= Christopher Monger |date=2014 |access-date=May 15, 2014 |title=''Searching for the Wrong-Eyed Jesus'' |publisher=Allmusic}}

They have subsequently released the albums ''[[Singing Bones]]'' (2003), ''[[Last Days of Wonder]]'' (2006), ''[[Honey Moon (The Handsome Family album)|Honey Moon]]'' (2009), and ''[[Wilderness (The Handsome Family album)|Wilderness]]'' (2013) as well as the collections ''[[Smothered and Covered]]'' (2003) and ''[[Scattered (The Handsome Family album)|Scattered]]'' (2010).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/171749-the-handsome-family-wilderness/|title=The Handsome Family: Wilderness|publisher=Popmatters.com|last=Arado|first=Matt|date=2013-05-10|access-date=2014-02-23}}</ref> Their latest album, ''[[Unseen (The Handsome Family album)|Unseen]]'' was released in September 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/the-handsome-family-unseen/}|title=The Handsome Family: Unseen|publisher=Popmatters.com|last=Coberlake|first=Justin|date=2016-10-05|access-date=2017-08-05}}</ref>

The track "Far from Any Road," from the album ''[[Singing Bones]]'', was used as the main title theme song for HBO's 2014 crime drama ''[[True Detective (TV series)|True Detective]]'' by the show's music director, [[T Bone Burnett]]. ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' included season one's opening sequence in their list of the "Ten of the Best" title sequences on television.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/how-patrick-clair-won-the-emmy-for-90-seconds-of-true-detective-20140818-104xuz.html |title=How Patrick Clair won the Emmy for 90 seconds of True Detective |first=Paul |last=Kalina |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] |date=August 22, 2014 |access-date=January 24, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105215333/http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/how-patrick-clair-won-the-emmy-for-90-seconds-of-true-detective-20140818-104xuz.html |archive-date=November 5, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Their songs have been covered repeatedly by musician [[Andrew Bird]], including a full-length album of covers released in 2014, ''[[Things Are Really Great Here, Sort Of…]]''

==Musical style==
The Handsome Family's style is a blend of traditional [[Country music |country]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and [[murder ballad]]s.<ref name= "Layne" /> Early recordings have [[Rock music |rock]] elements, but these were less evident from 1996's ''Milk and Scissors'' onwards.<ref name= "Layne" /> The duo's penchant for a tongue-in-cheek, macabre approach to alt-country has been noted by many critics; Andy Fyfe of ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' called them "Americana's ghostly [[Sonny & Cher]]."<ref name=Mojo>{{cite magazine |last=Fyfe |first=Andy |date=2016-09-16 |title=The Handsome Family: Unseen |magazine=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]] }}</ref> A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn described their music as "rootsy, literary country-rock that’s a little like a collaboration between [[Hank Williams]] and [[Edgar Allan Poe]]."<ref name=avclub>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-handsome-family-wilderness,97670/|title=The Handsome Family: Wilderness|publisher=Avclub.com|last=Bahn|first=Christopher|date=2013-05-14|access-date=2013-07-08}}</ref>

Rennie's lyrics have a strong [[storytelling]] component, drawing on themes from [[Gothic fiction]], as well as [[American folk music]], and often involving macabre subjects as murders, suicides and ghosts.  Some songs are also based on actual historical figures or events, including the lives and deaths of [[Amelia Earhart]] ("Amelia Earhart vs. the Dancing Bear", on ''[[Milk and Scissors]]''), [[Emily Shore]] ("Emily Shore 1819–1839", on ''Milk and Scissors''), [[Robert Wadlow]] ("The Giant of Illinois", on ''[[Through the Trees]]''), [[Natalie Wood]] ("Natalie Wood", an [[outtake]] from ''[[Twilight (The Handsome Family album) |Twilight]]'', which appears on ''[[Smothered and Covered]]''), and [[Nikola Tesla]] ("Tesla's Hotel Room", on ''[[Last Days of Wonder]]'').  The title of ''Last Days of Wonder'' is a reference to [[Puritan]] scientist and witch-hunter [[Cotton Mather]]'s 1693 book ''[[Wonders of the Invisible World]]'', which Rennie found intriguing because of what she called its "madness brimming under the surface of things."<ref name = "avclub-interview">{{cite news | last = Bahn | first = Christopher | title = Interview: Brett and Rennie Sparks of The Handsome Family | work = A.V.
