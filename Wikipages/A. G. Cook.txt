== Early life ==
Alexander Guy Cook is the son of English architect [[Peter Cook (architect)|Sir Peter Cook]] and Israeli architect Yael Reisner. He attended [[Goldsmiths, University of London]], where he studied music.<ref name="diy-hunt">{{cite web|title=Inside the hard drive of PC Music|url=http://diymag.com/2014/06/11/inside-the-hard-drive-of-pc-music|last=Hunt|first=El|date=11 June 2014|website=[[DIY (magazine)|DIY]]|access-date=5 February 2015}}</ref>

It was at [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths]] he reconnected with [[Danny L Harle]], with whom he had gone to school as a teen.<ref name="tank-golsorkhi" /> The two bonded over their shared musical tastes and interest in comedy duo [[Tim & Eric]]. This grew into a musical project called Dux Content.<ref name="dummy-bulut">{{cite web |url=http://www.dummymag.com/features/next-danny-l-harle-interview |title=Next: Danny L Harle |last=Bulut |first=Selim |date=24 February 2015 |website=Dummy |access-date=25 February 2015}}</ref>

== Career ==
=== 2011–2013: Career beginnings ===
Since they did not have a vocalist, Dux Content focused on musical experiments like [[compound metre]]s and changes in [[tempo]].<ref name="dummy-bulut" /> One of their earlier works was a collection of compositions for the [[Disklavier]], released with Spencer Noble and Tim Phillips under the name "Dux Consort".<ref name="pitchfork-sherburne" />

[[File:EasyFun logo.png|thumb|left|Cook has worked on graphics for PC Music acts including easyFun and Maxo.<ref name="pitchfork-sherburne" />]]
Cook created Gamsonite, a "pseudo-label" collecting his early collaborations.<ref name="diy-hunt" /> Dux Content released its songs with strange renderings of digital avatars for promotional artwork.<ref name="pitchfork-sherburne" /> They contributed to the score for Alicia Norman's animated film ''Heart of Death'' and began considering a children's television show titled ''Dux Content's Jungle Jam''. Cook and Harle explored how to build rhythms out of a vocalist's natural singing tempo and released the results as "Dux Kidz". The project was noticed by producer [[Sophie (musician)|Sophie]], who later worked with PC Music's acts.<ref name="dummy-bulut" /> Cook began working on building flashy websites with [[Hannah Diamond]] and decided to focus on using websites to promote music.<ref name="diy-hunt" />

=== 2013–2015: Foundation of PC Music ===

In August 2013, Cook founded PC Music as a way of embracing an [[A&R]] role, with the aim of "recording people who don't normally make music and treating them as if they're a major label artist."<ref name="tank-golsorkhi" /> In January 2014, Cook released "Keri Baby" as his first solo single, with vocals by Diamond.<ref name="awl-cliff">{{cite web |url=http://www.theawl.com/2014/11/pc-music-forever |title=PC Music Forever |last=Cliff |first=Aimee |date=21 November 2014 |publisher=[[The Awl]] |access-date=6 February 2015}}</ref> The track uses pop clichés and glitchy vocals to depict Diamond as a digital entity on a screen.<ref name="awl-cliff" /><ref name="dazed-cliff">{{cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/22868/1/the-top-20-tracks-of-2014 |title=The top 20 tracks of 2014 |last=Cliff |first=Aimee |website=[[Dazed]] |date=12 December 2014 |access-date=6 February 2015}}</ref> His follow-up single "Beautiful" was released in June.

Cook's style of music amplifies the clichés of mainstream pop music from the 1990s and 2000s.<ref name="dazed-cliff-100" /> He follows the work of "mega-producers" such as [[Max Martin]] and [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]].<ref name="tank-golsorkhi" /> Cook references [[Scritti Politti]]'s album ''[[Cupid & Psyche 85]]'' for its "conscious decision to take pop music and make it as shiny and detailed as possible".<ref name="cmu-barchi">{{cite web|url=http://www.completemusicupdate.com/article/cmu-artists-of-the-year-2014-pc-music/ |title=CMU Artists Of The Year 2014: PC Music |last=Barchi |first=Aly |publisher=[[Complete Music Update]] |date=12 December 2014|access-date=12 January 2015}}</ref> He cites Korean and Japanese pop music as influences, as well as [[gyaru]] subculture.<ref name="tank-golsorkhi" />

Cook begins constructing tracks by constructing chords and melodies note by note.<ref name="tank-golsorkhi" /> He prefers the sounds of virtual instruments and avoids sound design early in the process, giving his music a deadpan simplicity. He experiments with combining dissonant sounds, and the resulting dense, multi-layered arrangements are influenced by the [[Black MIDI]] techniques.<ref name="pitchfork-sherburne" /><ref name="tank-golsorkhi" /> Cook's arrangements are inspired by the mechanized music of composer [[Conlon Nancarrow]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/11/arts/music/review-pc-music-and-sophie-in-a-high-concept-extravaganza-at-bric-house.html |title=Review: PC Music and Sophie in a High-Concept Extravaganza at BRIC House |last=Pareles |first=Jon |author-link=Jon Pareles |date=10 May 2015 |website=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=11 May 2015}}</ref> When collaborating with other artists, he prepares an extensive demo so that they can complete lyrics and record vocals straight away. Cook thoroughly processes the vocals, [[chopping (sampling technique)|chopping]] them to use as a rhythmic element atop the melody.<ref name="tank-golsorkhi" />

In contrast to most of the artists on PC Music, Cook wears plain clothing.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/02/pc-music-dance-music-collective |title=PC Music: the future of pop or 'contemptuous parody'? |last=Wolfson |first=Sam |date=2 May 2015 |website=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=2 May 2015}}</ref> [[GFOTY]] jokingly characterised his style as [[normcore]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02mrwmt |title=PC Music Interview |last=Stephens |first=Huw |author-link=Huw Stephens |date=25 March 2015 |publisher=[[BBC Radio 1]] |access-date=2 May 2015}}</ref>
