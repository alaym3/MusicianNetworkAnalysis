He is one of the co-founders of ''The D-Generation''.<ref>{{cite news|first=Chris|last=Hook|title=Evolution of breakfast radio moves into its next phase with rival stations poised for battle|date=14 January 2014|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/evolution-of-breakfast-radio-moves-into-its-next-phase-with-rival-stations-poised-for-battle/story-fni0cvc9-1226804819076|access-date=19 January 2014}}</ref> 

Cilauro wrote for, and performed in, the troupe's show during its 1986–87 run on [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC TV]] (which also led to the album ''The Satanic Sketches''). Cilauro continued as a member of the D-Gen when the team hosted their ''Breakfast Show'' on Triple M radio (1986–1992), appearing as the simple-minded "Wayne from [[St Albans, Victoria|St. Albans]]" and "Gino Tagliatoni" amongst other roles. Cilauro was a writer/performer on the D-Generation's 1992–1993 sketch comedy ''[[The Late Show (1990s Australian TV series)|The Late Show]]'', appearing on such segments as ''Graham & the Colonel'', ''The Oz Brothers'' and ''Jeff & Terry Bailey''.{{cn|date=September 2015}}

After the second and last season of ''The Late Show'', Cilauro starred as Stix in the 1994 ABC cop show satire ''[[Funky Squad]]'', which he also co-created and served as one of the writer/producer/directors. He went on to help set up the [[Working Dog Productions|Working Dog]] production company and was one of the writer/producer/directors of ''[[Frontline (Australian television series)|Frontline]]'' (1994–97), in which he also had a recurring onscreen role as weatherman Geoffrey Salter. Since then, Cilauro co-wrote Working Dog's popular films ''[[The Castle (1997 Australian film)|The Castle]]'' (1997) and ''[[The Dish]]'' (2000) and appeared as a regular member (and occasional host) of the 1998–2003 [[Network Ten]] programme ''[[The Panel (Australian TV series)|The Panel]]''. 

Cilauro has been an executive producer of several Working Dog productions, including ''The Panel'', ''[[A River Somewhere]]'' (1997–98), and ''[[All Aussie Adventures]]'' (2001–02). He played the Head of Market Research, Theo Tsolakis, on ''[[The Hollowmen]]'' (2008), a series which Cilauro co-wrote and co-produced. Cilauro also played IT technician Griffin on the [[Shaun Micallef]] sitcom ''[[Welcher & Welcher]]'' (2003) and K2 on the 1996 Working Dog radio sketch ''[[Johnny Swank]]''.

During the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], he hosted a nightly comedy/variety show called ''[[Santo, Sam and Ed's Cup Fever!]]'' live from Melbourne alongside [[Ed Kavalee]] and [[Sam Pang]].
In 2014 Cilauro joined his Working Dog colleagues, Sitch and Gleisner to stage the group's first play, ''The Speechmaker''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Woodhead|first1=Cameron|title=Review: The Speechmaker|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/theatre/the-speechmaker-a-slippery-clever-entertaining-circus-20140606-zrzq5.html|access-date=12 August 2014|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=6 June 2014}}</ref>
