Sembello was nominated for an [[56th Academy Awards|Academy Award]] and a [[41st Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] for his 1983 song "[[Maniac (Michael Sembello song)|Maniac]]", which he sang and co-wrote. The song reached number one in the United States<ref name=hot100/> and featured in the [[Flashdance (soundtrack)|''Flashdance'' film soundtrack]].

He is the brother of the late songwriter and composer [[Danny Sembello]] and the late singer songwriter John Sembello of [[Dino & Sembello]] fame.

==Early life==
Sembello was born and raised in [[Ardmore, Pennsylvania]], a western suburb of Philadelphia.<ref>{{cite web |title=Europeans Crazy About Main Line's 'Maniac' |url=https://patch.com/pennsylvania/ardmore/europeans-crazy-about-main-lines-maniac-9ad3006d |website=Ardmore-Merion-Wynnewood, PA Patch |language=en |date=November 27, 2012}}</ref>

==Career==
Sembello began his career in music as a session musician, working as a guitarist. By age 17, he was working professionally with [[Stevie Wonder]] on electric and acoustic guitar as a studio player on Wonder's ''[[Fulfillingness' First Finale]]''.<ref name="Millward2018">{{cite book|author=Steve Millward|title=Fast Forward: Music And Politics In 1974|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TXswDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT58|date=9 April 2018|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd|isbn=978-1-78589-540-1|pages=58–}}</ref> He continued the same year, chosen as one of the core artists who worked on ''[[Songs in the Key of Life]]'', an ambitious double album that took two years to create. He was credited as lead and rhythm guitarist on most of the tracks—including the intricate [[Jazz fusion|jazz rock]] lead guitar part of the instrumental "Contusion"<ref>{{Citation|title=Pat Martino Documentary Michael Sembello Interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJ-kBgbAwhE|language=en|access-date=2019-11-30}}</ref>—and shares songwriting credit with Wonder on the song "Saturn", according to the album's liner notes.

Sembello wrote the song "Carousel", which [[Michael Jackson]] recorded for his 1982 album ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]'', but it was replaced on the track list by "[[Human Nature (Michael Jackson song)|Human Nature]]".<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Human Nature |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/human-nature-michael-jackson |first=Garin |last=Pirnia |date=May 7, 2012 |magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/music/the-maestro-quincy-jones-and-his-singing-montreal-protege/article18762448|title=The maestro Quincy Jones and his singing Montreal protégé|last=Wheeler|first=Brad|date=20 May 2014|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/7373w6BOh?url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/music/the-maestro-quincy-jones-and-his-singing-montreal-protege/article18762448|archive-date=October 12, 2018|access-date=October 12, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The song was included as a bonus track on ''[[Thriller 25]]'', the 25th-anniversary edition reissue of the album; the full version was released on iTunes in 2013 as part of The Ultimate Fan Extras Collection.<ref>{{cite web |title=Carousel |url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nearly-270-michael-jackson-tracks-packed-into-new-anthologies-the-indispensable-collection-and-the-ultimate-fan-extras-collection-available-now-exclusively-on-itunes-213956461.html |first=Legacy |last=Recordings |date=July 2, 2013 |publisher=PR NewsWire.}}.

Sembello released his first solo album ''[[Bossa Nova Hotel]]'' in 1983. The song "[[Maniac (Michael Sembello song)|Maniac]]" from that album, which he co-wrote with his keyboardist Dennis Matkosky, was selected for inclusion in the film ''[[Flashdance]]''. "Maniac" was the second-best-charting song from the soundtrack (after the [[Flashdance... What a Feeling|title track]]) and the ninth-biggest single of 1983. That soundtrack won a [[26th Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy Award in 1984]] for [[Best Album of Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or a Television Special]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=H7MjAAAAIBAJ&pg=6742,7885903&dq=michael-sembello&hl=en|title=Jackson Claims 8 Grammys|date=February 29, 1984|work=[[Times-News (Hendersonville, North Carolina)|Times-News]]|access-date=December 21, 2010}}</ref> Sembello and Matkosky have claimed that the song was supposed to be about a vicious pet murderer after having seen a [[slasher flick]], possibly ''[[Maniac (1980 film)|Maniac]]'' or ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]''.<ref>{{citation|title=The Number Ones: Michael Sembello's "Maniac"|author=Tom Breihan|date=July 22, 2020|website=Stereogum|url=https://www.stereogum.com/2092075/the-number-ones-michael-sembellos-maniac/columns/the-number-ones/}}</ref> In 2020, Sembello, along with Matkosky, appeared in ''Maniac Men'', an interview included on the 4K UHD Blu-ray reissue of ''Maniac''.<ref>{{citation|title='Zombie' and 'Maniac' Coming to 4K UHD Blu-ray May 26 From MVD and Blue Underground|author=Stephanie Prange|date=March 19, 2020|url=https://www.mediaplaynews.com/zombie-and-maniac-coming-to-4k-uhd-blu-ray-may-26-from-mvd-and-blue-underground/}}</ref>

Records]] debut. They recorded the album ''Moon Island'', released on [[EMI Records|EMI Japan]].
