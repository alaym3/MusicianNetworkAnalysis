==Quartier Latin International==
{{main|Quartier Latin International}}

In the late 1990s, a key meeting sealed the beginning of a musical ascension, when he joined [[Quartier Latin International]] founded by [[Koffi Olomide]]. Ipupa became "conductor of the orchestra". Ipupa included his composition "Eternelement" in the ''Force de frappe'' album. He was also known for duets with Koffi Olomide in ''Effrakata'' specially the track "Effervescent" in 2001. As with many other Congolese stars, the public liked to have nicknames for artists and soon he was called "Di Caprio", "Anelka" and "The Great One". With success in the orchestra, he also promoted his own solo projects including his own album ''[[Droit Chemin (album)|Droit Chemin]]'',''Arsenal des Belles mélodies '', Power, Tokos and Control. He has been heavily involved in the planning of the commemoration of the band's 30th anniversary, despite having quit the band in 2006.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=http://fr.africatime.com/republique_democratique_du_congo/articles/pour-les-30-annees-du-quartier-latin-international-fally-ipupa-simplique-dans-lorganisation&prev=search|title=For the 30 years of the Quartier Latin International: Fally Ipupa is involved in the organization of the event|
