==History==

===2010–2014: Formation and early years===
[[File:Lemaitre_plain_background_origami_styled_logo,_singularity_album.png|thumb|right|Lemaitre's logo, used in almost every EP made by them as a means of visual identification]]
During an interview, Lund and Jansen explained that the band is named after [[Georges Lemaître]], a Belgian priest who first proposed the [[Big Bang|Big Bang Theory]] and derived the physics concept now referred to as [[Hubble's law|Hubble's Law]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Duncan|title=Video: Lemaitre, "Fiction" + Interview|url=http://www.thefader.com/2013/03/07/video-lemaitre-fiction-interview/|work=Fader|accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref> In a 2014 music discovery piece with [[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] magazine,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/discovery-lemaitre#_|title=Discovery: Lemaitre|website=Interview Magazine|date=24 March 2014|access-date=2016-03-30}}</ref> Jansen further added "Le maitre" means "the master" in French, though the pair were unaware of this when first choosing a name for the project.

Lemaitre's first track was titled "<span class="plainlinks">[https://soundcloud.com/serious-url/momentum Momentum]</span>",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/serious-url/momentum|title=Lemaitre's track Momentum}}</ref> now dating {{Years ago|2010|10|07}} years since its initial release. This track was one of two tracks released prior to releasing their debut EP, ''The Friendly Sound—''the other being ''"<span class="plainlinks">[https://soundcloud.com/serious-url/lem-aitre-primeval-atom Primeval Atom]</span>"''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-friendly-sound-ep/id496870364|title=The Friendly Sound EP on iTunes}}</ref>

====Relativity series====

Lemaitre is most commonly recognized for their series of EPs: the ''Relativity Series''.<ref name="relativitySeries">{{cite web|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/discovery-lemaitre|title=since their Relativity series came out|date=24 March 2014}}</ref> This series consists of the following EPs: ''Relativity 1'', ''Relativity 2'', ''Relativity 3'', and ''Relativity By Nite''. The duo was praised for their use of all original samples.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://radio.com/2014/07/17/new-music-to-know-lemaitre-brings-indie-pop-sensibilities-and-some-scientific-theories-to-the-dance-floor/|title=New Music to Know: Lemaitre Brings Indie-Pop Sensibilities & Some Scientific Theories to the Dance Floor|access-date=2016-03-30}}</ref>

''Relativity By Nite'' was differed from most of Lemaitre's previous EPs in that it was longer in comparison to previous EP releases and almost entirely consisted of unheard remixes and instrumental pieces.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/relativity-by-nite/id704528963| title=Lemaitre's Relativity By Nite EP on iTunes}}</ref>

Lemaitre's third EP and second in the ''Relativity Series'', ''Relativity 2'', topped the Canadian charts and US iTunes electronic albums category during May of 2012. The EP went to top charts across a number of countries, placing #3 in Switzerland, #8 in Australia and #10 in France. Worldwide, ''Relativity 2'' charted at #4 in iTunes' Pop category.<ref name="charts">[http://www.last.fm/music/Lem%C3%A2itre "Charts Information"], Retrieved on 30 March 2013.</ref>

====Joining Astralwerks====

In January 2014, the duo signed to [[Astralwerks Records]]: home to notable acts, including [[Daft Punk]], whom Lemaitre has previously referenced as a significant source of inspiration for the group's music style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musicnorway.no/2014/01/07/lemaitre-inks-astralwerks-us-deal/ |title=Lemaitre inks Astralwerks US deal}}</ref> Consequently, Lemaitre had the opportunity to work on remixes for other [[Astralwerks Records|Astralwerks]] artists, such as [[Porter Robinson]]. Jansen and Lund are credited and featured on the song "Polygon Dust" from Porter Robinson's album, ''[[Worlds (Porter Robinson album)|Worlds]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3SdHjS4hSE|title=Lemaitre remix of a Porter Robinson track}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1ZhnSNN8UI|title=Lemaitre collaborated with Porter Robinson}}</ref>

Furthermore, Lemaitre mentioned that the 'choice [to join Astralwerks] felt right', especially given that the label was home to some their own "sonic heroes", namely [[Daft Punk]] and [[The Chemical Brothers]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://news.beatport.com/en/norwegian-electro-pop-duo-lemaitre-is-living-a-low-budget-la-dream/ | title=The choice felt right, as the label had been home to their sonic heroes; Daft Punk and the Chemical Brothers | access-date=9 February 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409034723/https://news.beatport.com/en/norwegian-electro-pop-duo-lemaitre-is-living-a-low-budget-la-dream/ | archive-date=9 April 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

===2014–present: ''1749 and Chapter One''===
On 29 January 2016, the duo released their seventh EP, ''1749''.<ref name=":0" /> The name "''1749"''  was inspired by the home<ref>{{citation|title=The title references their current address|url=https://news.beatport.com/en/norwegian-electro-pop-duo-lemaitre-is-living-a-low-budget-la-dream/|access-date=9 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409034723/https://news.beatport.com/en/norwegian-electro-pop-duo-lemaitre-is-living-a-low-budget-la-dream/|archive-date=9 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Lemaitre has been living in during their time in Los Angeles—which also serves as a low budget–home studio for the pair. The home was previously owned by famed American rapper and producer [[Dr. Dre]] during the 1990s.<ref>{{citation|title=A luxury that surely pleased Dr. Dre when he lived in this same house in 1995|url=https://news.beatport.com/en/norwegian-electro-pop-duo-lemaitre-is-living-a-low-budget-la-dream/|access-date=9 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409034723/https://news.beatport.com/en/norwegian-electro-pop-duo-lemaitre-is-living-a-low-budget-la-dream/|archive-date=9 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Following the release of ''1749'', Lemaitre embarked on a short 7-city European tour during February, including a stop in their homeland in Oslo, Norway. During this time, the music video for the song "Stepping Stone" featuring artist Mark Johns, a member of [[Skrillex]]'s [[OWSLA]] creative collective, was released on 18 February 2016.<ref>{{Citation|last=LemaitreVEVO|title=Lemaitre - Stepping Stone ft.
