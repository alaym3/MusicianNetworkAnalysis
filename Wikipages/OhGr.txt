{{lowercase|title=ohGr}}
'''ohGr''' is an American [[industrial band]] formed by [[Nivek Ogre]] and [[Mark Walk]] of [[Skinny Puppy]]. Early ohGr releases incorporated [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[synth-pop]] influences, and in contrast to Skinny Puppy, utilized conventional structures and a lighter tone. Ogre noted that this direction was inspired by the [[pop music|pop]] bands he enjoyed as a child, such as [[The Archies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJXCLfItrcE|title=He Played The Killing Game First - Nivek Ogre Q&A - Texas Frightmare Weekend 2014 - May 4th, 2014|date=September 8, 2014|access-date=October 15, 2017|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> However, in releases such as ''[[Devils in my Details]]'', ohGr has taken to a more abrasive, non-linear flavour of [[electro-industrial]], while continuing to release pop albums such as 2018's ''[[Tricks (album)|Tricks]]''.

==History==
The band was officially formed in 2000, although the material for the first album, ''[[Welt (album)|Welt]]'' dates back to the mid-nineties, having been held up due to legal trouble with [[American Recordings (US)|American Recordings]]. [[W.E.L.T.]] was actually originally the title of the group (an [[acronym]] of "When Everyone Learns Truth"), until it was discovered that in the interval it had been taken by a Californian punk band. [[Al Jourgensen]] was also originally involved (who had the then band's name tattooed in anticipation of the project), and only one track he collaborated on has been leaked to the public, titled "Noreen". The music of that song later became [[industrial metal]] group [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]]'s "[[The Fall (Ministry song)|The Fall]]", on their 1996 album ''[[Filth Pig]]''.

ohGr's third album titled ''[[Devils in my Details]]'' was released on October 17, 2008 in Germany,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spv.de/scripts/kcover_d.asp?nummer=92792&label=ns|title=SPV|website=Spv.de|access-date=October 15, 2017}}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> October 20 in the United Kingdom, and October 21 in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.devilsinmydetails.com|title=金融商品を利用した資産の作り方: 金融商品を利用した資産の作り方|website=Devilsinmydetails.com|access-date=October 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921081447/http://www.devilsinmydetails.com/|archive-date=September 21, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> ohGr toured in support of the album release during the autumn of 2008.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://litany.net/|title=Litany: Music News Covering Skinny Puppy, Download, ohGr and Related Projects|first=Corey|last=Goldberg|website=Litany.net|access-date=October 15, 2017}}</ref> At Comic-Con 2008, Ogre announced that [[Bill Moseley]] will be contributing to the new ohGr album, as a result of them becoming friends through [[Repo! The Genetic Opera]]. 

It was tentatively revealed in a [[Online chat|chat]] with the band that an album of [[B-side]]s from [[Devils in my Details]] (entitled "D-Sides") and an album of unreleased material from the 1990s (entitled "Dfault") was due to be released.<ref name="auto"/> In October 2009 a [[Hyperlink|link]] to [https://web.archive.org/web/20110521093307/http://www.wdihtf.com/ www.wdihtf.com] appeared on [[Skinny Puppy]]'s website. When users sign up to the [[mailing list]] they receive a [[Hyperlink|link]] to the song COLLIDOSKOPE which starts with many different voices saying "Welcome to Collidoskope".

As of May 10, 2011, ohGr has released a new studio album, ''[[unDeveloped]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metropolis-mailorder.com/product.php?prodnum=MET+720|title=Innovative Pop, Rock and Electronic Music – Metropolis Records|website=Metropolis-mailorder.com|access-date=October 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303030135/http://www.metropolis-mailorder.com/product.php?prodnum=MET+720|archive-date=March 3, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>  The album was a collaboration with [[Mark Walk]], with whom the previous album was created. Also on the album was the audio from the [[9-1-1|911]] call reporting [[Michael Jackson]]'s death (Track titled ''crash'').

In 2017, ohGr announced a [[PledgeMusic]] campaign to raise funds for their new album ''[[Tricks (album)|Tricks]]''.<ref name=Billboard>{{cite web |last1=Stutz |first1=Colin |title=PledgeMusic, Once a Crowdfunding Haven for Artists, Now Owes Them Thousands of Dollars (January 24, 2019) |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8494827/pledgemusic-crowdfunding-owes-artists-thousands-late-payments |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=25 February 2019}}</ref> The album was originally scheduled for release on October 31, 2017, but was delayed due to mastering errors.<ref>{{cite web |title=ohGr: Tricks Release |url=https://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/ohgr/updates/90624 |publisher=[[PledgeMusic]] |access-date=June 18, 2018}}</ref> The band submitted their final mix to PledgeMusic in Spring 2018, but received no word from the company regarding payment. Without the money promised by PledgeMusic, the band released the album digitally and went on tour without any physical media to sell.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Trapp |first1=Philip |title=Crowdfunding Platform PledgeMusic Owes Its Artists Thousands (January 24, 2019) |url=https://www.altpress.com/news/pledgemusic-owes-artists-thousands-report/ |website=[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]] |access-date=25 February 2019}}</ref> Walk went to the media following reports of similar situations happening to other bands who were using PledgeMusic. According to Walk, the band had received only $40,000 of the $140,000 they had raised during the campaign and were unable to pay for the manufacturing of the products they promised fans.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Stutz |first1=Colin |title=PledgeMusic's Failed Promise Leaves Artists in Limbo and the Future of Music Crowdfunding in Jeopardy (February 8, 2019) |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8497348/pledgemusic-music-crowdfunding-industry-artist-campaigns-regulation |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=25 February 2019}}</ref>

==Touring==
The band toured in 2001 to support the release of their debut album ''[[Welt (album)|Welt]]''; the live band consisted of [[Nivek Ogre]], [[Tim Sköld]] (bass), [[cEvin Key]] (drums, keyboards), Loki der Quaeler (keyboards), and [[William Morrison (director)|William Morrison]] (guitars). 2003 saw the release of a follow up, ''[[SunnyPsyOp]]'' (a play on the phrase "[[Fried egg|sunny side up]]" and military [[Psychological Operations|PsyOps]]). There were initially plans to tour for ''SunnyPsyOp'', with [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] in a festival type arrangement. These plans fell through, although much of the material from the second album had already been played live on the ''[[Welt (album)|Welt]]'' tour.

2008 saw ohGr on tour throughout the U.S. and Canada in support of the album ''[[Devils in my Details]]'' with a live band including William Morrison returning on guitars, drummer [[Justin Bennett]], keyboardist Jeff "Squigg" Smith.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.litany.net/archive/?month=12&year=2011|title=Litany: Music News Covering Skinny Puppy, Download, ohGr and Related Projects|first=Corey|last=Goldberg|website=Litany.net|access-date=October 15, 2017}}</ref>

In late 2011, ohGr announced a December 2011 West Coast USA and Canada tour consisting of nine dates with direct support by fellow [[Metropolis Records]] artist [[Left Spine Down]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metropolis-records.com/news/?id=79|title=ohGr with Left Spine Down live dates announced! – Metropolis Records|website=Metropolis-records.com|access-date=October 15, 2017}}</ref>

In autumn 2017, ohGr supported [[KMFDM]] on a North American tour.

The 2018 touring lineup consisted of Ogre on lead vocals and samples, Morrison on bass, keyboards and backing vocals, Bennett on drums, [[Matthew Setzer]] on guitars and backing vocals, and Dustin Schultz on keyboards and backing vocals.

==Videos==
ohGr has released three promotional videos, all directed by [[William Morrison (director)|William Morrison]]. The first was a [[stop-motion]] creation for the track "Cracker".  The second was a live performance of "Minus", filmed by Michael Condo at several venues from the 2001 tour. The third was for "MaJiK", from the second album; this also employed [[stop-motion]], and was a [[collaboration]] with artist [[Thomas Kuntz]]. "Cracker" and "MaJiK" have both been played occasionally on [[MTV2]] and [[Fuse (television)|Fuse]]. All three have been available through ohGr's website, and "MaJiK" appeared on the audio CD for ''[[SunnyPsyOp]]'', albeit with some serious technical glitches. You can also see and hear a partial live performance from the 2001 tour on the short film John E. Dirt by director Bill Draheim.
