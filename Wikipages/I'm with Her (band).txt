== History ==
When [[Sarah Jarosz]] was nine years old, she met [[Sara Watkins]] at a festival.<ref name="pareles2018" /> Both of them grew up with [[bluegrass music]].<ref name="lewis2018" /> Jarosz began playing the mandolin when she was ten,<ref name="npr2009" /> and [[Aoife O'Donovan]] noticed her when she was fifteen. O'Donovan said about Jarosz:<ref name="pareles2018" />

<blockquote>You were this amazing young person. You just had so much confidence and skill but you were never, like, "Look at me, I'm so good and I'm so young, heh heh heh." You always seemed like a peer.</blockquote>

Watkins, Jarosz and O'Donovan started collaborating at a workshop at the 2014 [[Telluride Bluegrass Festival]], where they had been asked to sing together.<ref name="pareles2018" /><ref name="guardian2018" /> They performed for the first time at the January 2015 [[Celtic Connections]] festival in Scotland, and continued to tour in Europe. In mid-2015, they wrote songs together for four days in [[Los Angeles]], where Watkins lives. In December that year, they wrote for eight days at a farmhouse in [[Vermont]] with a [[hot tub]] and a wood-burning fireplace, surrounded by snow and near a barn with horses.<ref name="pareles2018" /><ref name="guardian2018" /><ref name="greenberg2018" /><ref name="lewis2018" /><ref name="cirisano2018" /><ref name="hallenbeck2018" /> The group began using the phrase "I'm with Her" as their tour name in early 2015.<ref name="lewis2018" /> The phrase was later adopted by the [[Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign|2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign]], unrelated to the band.<ref name="pareles2018" />

The group covered [[John Hiatt]]'s "[[Crossing Muddy Waters#Track listing|Crossing Muddy Waters]]" in 2015, and released the single "Little Lies" in 2017, touring the US later that year.<ref name="gold2017" /> They recorded their debut album ''[[See You Around]]'' at [[Real World Studios]] in [[Bath, Somerset]], England, three weeks after they had written it. The album was co-produced by [[Ethan Johns]] and released on February 16, 2018. American singer-songwriter [[Gillian Welch]] wrote the album's last track "Hundred Miles"; the trio is credited with writing all other songs on the album. The group toured in the U.S. and in Europe in the first half of 2018.<ref name="pareles2018" /><ref name="lewis2018" /><ref name="levenson2018" /><ref name="mckenna2018" />

At the 62nd Grammy Awards on January 26, 2020, I'm With Her won the award for Best American Roots Song for their recording of "Call My Name." The song was co-written by Jarosz, Watkins, and O'Donovan.
