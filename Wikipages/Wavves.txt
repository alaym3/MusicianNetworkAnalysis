== History ==

=== Early years and early releases (2008–2009) ===
Wavves started in 2008 as the recording project of Nathan Williams. Wavves released several 7"s as well as a cassette leading up to the first release, ''[[Wavves (album)|Wavves]]''. After gaining recognition, Ryan Ulsh was enlisted as a touring drummer and Wavves embarked on their first US and European tours. Wavves released their self-titled debut album in 2008, subsequently drawing the attention of [[Pitchfork Media]].<ref>Hogan, Marc, [http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/147966-on-repeat-wavves-wavves-mp3-stream "On Repeat: Wavves: "Wavves""] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303212223/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/147966-on-repeat-wavves-wavves-mp3-stream |date=March 3, 2009 }}, ''Pitchfork Media'', December 8, 2008.</ref><ref>New Music Monday, [https://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=6630685 "Hot Indie Albums for 2009"], ''ABC News'', January 12, 2009.</ref> At the time, the band consisted of guitarist Nathan Williams and drummer Ryan Ulsh, who replaced Baby Animal during production. Their second full-length album, ''[[Wavvves]]'', was released on February 3, 2009,<ref>Fat Possum Records, [http://www.fatpossum.com/albums.php "Wavves: ''Wavvves''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217105713/http://fatpossum.com/albums.php |date=February 17, 2009 }}, fatpossumrecords.com, retrieved February 11, 2009.</ref> and was well received by outlets such as ''[[Spin Magazine|Spin]]'',<ref>Kornharber, Spencer, [http://www.spin.com/reviews/wavves-wavvves-fat-possum "Wavves, "Wavvves" (Fat Possum)"], February 28, 2009.</ref> [[The A.V.

Singer Nathan Williams experienced a public breakdown as the band was unable to complete their set at the 2009 Barcelona Primavera Sound Festival. Williams, who admitted he had taken a cocktail of [[MDMA|ecstasy]] and [[Diazepam|Valium]], fought with drummer Ryan Ulsh and insulted the Spanish crowd, who then pelted him with bottles. Apologizing for their performance, Williams admitted the next day that he was addicted to alcohol. As a result, the band cancelled the remainder of their European tour.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2010/06/23/wavves-king-of-beach-rock-roll-hotel/|title=Bigger Than the Basement: Wavves, 'King of the Beach,' at Rock and Roll Hotel|date=June 23, 2010|access-date=June 25, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613042746/http://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2010/06/23/wavves-king-of-beach-rock-roll-hotel/|url-status=live|archive-date=June 13, 2015}}</ref> When Ulsh quit the band, [[Zach Hill]] replaced him as the drummer of Wavves for a brief time.
