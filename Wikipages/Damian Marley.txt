Damian Marley was nicknamed "Jr. Gong" in honour of his legendary father, Bob "Tuff Gong" Marley. His mother, [[Cindy Breakspeare]], is a [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] jazz musician, former model and crowned [[Miss World]] 1976. After seeing the movie ''[[Damien: Omen II]]'', which is about the coming of the Antichrist, one of Bob's last requests in Germany was to have Damian's name changed. "Damien being a devil...It was inappropriate for him as a Rastafarian to have a child with that name," Bob said and Damian's name was later changed.<ref>White, Timothy.
