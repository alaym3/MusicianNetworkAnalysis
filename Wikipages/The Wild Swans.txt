==Synopsis==
[[File:The queen disenchants the wild swans and fains upon the funeral pyre.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration from 'the book ''Fairy Tales by Hans Christian Andersen'', London: Sampson Low, Marston, Low, and Searle, 1872]]

In a faraway kingdom, there lives a widowed king with his twelve children: eleven princes and one princess. One day, he decides to remarry, but marries a wicked [[Queen consort|queen]] who is a [[witch]]. Out of spite, the queen turns her eleven stepsons into magnificent [[swan]]s, who are allowed to temporarily become human only at nights, and forces them to fly away. When their sister Elisa has reached the age of fifteen, the queen tries to bewitch her – but Elisa's goodness is too strong for this, so the queen has her banished after making her unrecognisable by dirtying her face. Elisa finds her brothers, who carry Elisa to safety in a foreign land where she is out of the reach of her [[evil stepmother]].

There, Elisa is guided by the queen of the [[fairies]] to gather [[stinging nettle]]s in graveyards to knit into shirts that will eventually help her brothers regain their human shapes. Elisa endures painfully blistered hands from nettle stings, and she must also take a vow of silence for the duration of her task, for speaking one word will kill her and her brothers. The handsome king of another faraway land happens to come across Elisa, who cannot talk, and falls in love with her. He grants her a room in his castle where she continues her knitting. Eventually he proposes to crown her as his queen and wife, and she accepts.

However, the [[archbishop]] is chagrined because he thinks Elisa is herself a witch, but the king will not believe him. One night Elisa runs out of nettles and is forced to collect more in a nearby church graveyard where the archbishop is watching. Ghoulish spirits that devour the bodies of the dead are also in the churchyard, and the archbishop believes that Elisa is in league with them.  He reports the incident to the king as proof of witchcraft. The statues of the [[saint]]s shake their heads in protest, but the archbishop misinterprets this sign as confirmation of Elisa's guilt. The archbishop orders Elisa put on [[Witch-hunt|trial for witchcraft]]. She can speak no word in her defense, and is sentenced to death by [[death by burning|burning at the stake]].

The brothers discover Elisa's plight and try to speak to the king but fail, thwarted by the rising sun. Even as the [[tumbril]] bears Elisa away to execution, she continues knitting, determined to continue up to the last moment of her life. This enrages the people, who are on the brink of snatching and ripping the shirts into pieces when the swans descend and rescue Elisa. The people interpret this as a sign from Heaven that Elisa is innocent while she already finishes the last shirt, but the executioner still prepares for the burning. When Elisa throws the shirts over the swans, her brothers all return to their human forms. Although in some versions, The youngest brother has a swan's wing instead of an arm, as Elisa did not have time to finish one sleeve of his shirt. Elisa is now free to speak and tell the truth but faints from exhaustion, so her brothers explain. As they do so, the firewood around Elisa's stake miraculously takes root and bursts into flowers. The king plucks the topmost flower and places it on Elisa's chest. She is revived by the white flower, and the king and Elisa are married.
