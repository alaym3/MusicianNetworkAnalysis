'''Hiram''' "'''Hank'''" '''Williams''' (September 17, 1923 – January 1, 1953) was an American singer, songwriter, and musician. Regarded as one of the most significant and influential American singers and songwriters of the 20th century, he recorded 35 singles (five released posthumously) that reached the top 10 of the ''Billboard'' Country & Western Best Sellers chart, including 11 that reached No. 1 (three posthumously).

Born and raised in [[Alabama]], Williams was given guitar lessons by African-American [[blues music|blues]] musician [[Rufus Payne]] in exchange for meals or money. Payne, along with [[Roy Acuff]] and [[Ernest Tubb]], had a major influence on Williams's later musical style. Williams began his music career in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] in 1937, when producers at local radio station [[WLWI (AM)|WSFA]] hired him to perform and host a 15-minute program. He formed the [[Drifting Cowboys]] backup band, which was managed by his mother, and dropped out of school to devote his time to his career. When several of his band members were [[Conscription in the United States|drafted]] during [[World War II]], he had trouble with their replacements, and WSFA terminated his contract because of his alcoholism.

Williams married singer [[Audrey Williams|Audrey Sheppard]], who was his manager for nearly a decade. After recording "Never Again" and "Honky Tonkin'" with [[Sterling Records (US)|Sterling Records]], he signed a contract with [[MGM Records]]. In 1947, he released "[[Move It On Over (song)|Move It on Over]]", which became a hit, and also joined the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' radio program. One year later, he released a cover of "[[Lovesick Blues]]", which carried him into the mainstream. After an initial rejection, Williams joined the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. He was unable to read or [[musical notation|notate music]] to any significant degree. Among the hits he wrote were "[[Your Cheatin' Heart]]", "[[Hey, Good Lookin' (song)|Hey, Good Lookin']]", and "[[I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry]]".

Years of back pain, alcoholism, and prescription drug abuse severely compromised Williams's health. In 1952, he divorced Sheppard and married singer [[Billie Jean Horton]]. He was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry because of his unreliability and alcoholism. On New Year's Day 1953, he suffered from heart failure and [[Death of Hank Williams|died suddenly]] at the age of 29 in [[Oak Hill, West Virginia]]. Despite his relatively brief career, he is one of the most celebrated and influential musicians of the 20th century, especially in [[country music]]. Many artists have covered his songs and he has influenced [[Elvis Presley]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[George Jones]], [[George Strait]], [[Charley Pride]], and [[The Rolling Stones]], among others. Williams was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1961, the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1970, and the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1987. The [[Pulitzer Prize]] jury awarded him a posthumous [[Pulitzer Prize Special Citations and Awards|special citation]] in 2010 for his "craftsmanship as a songwriter who expressed universal feelings with poignant simplicity and played a pivotal role in transforming country music into a major musical and cultural force in American life".

==Early life==
[[File:Hank-Williams-Georgiana-House.jpeg|thumb|Williams's family house in [[Georgiana, Alabama]]]]

Williams was born Hiram Williams{{sfn|Turpen|2007|p=?}}<!-- <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hank-Williams |title=Hank Williams &#124; American musician |website=Encyclopedia Britannica }access-date= December 26, 2019}}</ref> --> on September 17, 1923,{{sfn|Koon, George William|1983|p=6}} in the rural community of Mount Olive in [[Butler County, Alabama]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Hank's Bio |url=https://thehankwilliamsmuseum.net/bio |website=The Hank Williams Museum |access-date=September 25, 2019 |quote=Hank Williams was born on September 17, 1923, in the rural community of Mount Olive, AL. His birth certificate says "near Garland", Butler County. This is located 50 miles south of Montgomery.}}</ref> He was the third child of Jessie Lillybelle "Lillie" (née Skipper) and Elonzo Huble "Lon" Williams. He was of English descent. Elonzo was a [[railroad engineer]] for the W. T. Smith lumber company and was drafted during [[World War I]], serving from July 1918 to June 1919. He was severely injured after falling from a truck, breaking his collarbone and suffering a severe blow to the head.{{sfn|Koon, George William|1983|p=4}} The family's first child, Ernest Huble Williams, was born on July 5, 1921; he died two days later. They later had a daughter named Irene. Since Williams's parents were both followers of [[Freemasonry]],<ref>His father was a Mason and his mother was a member of the [[Order of the Eastern Star]].</ref> Williams was named after [[Hiram I]]. His name was misspelled as "Hiriam" on his birth certificate, which was prepared and signed when he was 10 years old.{{sfn|Flippo, Chet|1985|p=12}}

As a child, Williams was nicknamed "Harm" by his family and "Herky" or "Skeets" by his friends.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M|1981|p=7}} He was born with [[spina bifida occulta]], a birth defect of the [[spinal column]], which gave him lifelong pain; this became a factor in his later alcohol and drug abuse.{{sfn|Koon, George William|1983|p=10}} Williams's father was frequently relocated by the lumber company railway for which he worked, and the family lived in many southern Alabama towns. In 1930, when Williams was seven years old, Elonzo began suffering from facial [[paralysis]]. At a [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Affairs]] clinic in [[Pensacola, Florida]], doctors determined that the cause was a [[brain aneurysm]], and Elonzo was sent to the VA Medical Center in [[Alexandria, Louisiana]]. He remained hospitalized for eight years, rendering him mostly absent throughout Williams's childhood.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M|1981|p=9}} From that time on, Lillie assumed responsibility for the family.{{sfn|Middleton, Richard|2000|p=318}}

In the fall of 1934, the Williams family moved to [[Greenville, Alabama]], where Lillie opened a [[boarding house]] next to the Butler County courthouse.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M|1981|p=26}} In 1935, they settled in [[Garland, Alabama]], where Lillie opened a new boarding house; they later moved with Williams's cousin Opal McNeil to [[Georgiana, Alabama]],{{sfn|Williams, Roger M|1981|p=18}} where Lillie took several side jobs to support the family despite the bleak economic climate of the [[Great Depression]]. She worked in a [[cannery]] and served as a night-shift nurse in the local hospital.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M|1981|p=13}} Their first house burned down, and the family lost their possessions. They moved to a new house on the other side of town on Rose Street, which Williams's mother soon turned into another boarding house. The house had a small garden on which they grew diverse crops that Williams and his sister Irene sold around Georgiana.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M|1981|p=14}} At a chance meeting in Georgiana, Williams met U.S. Representative [[J. Lister Hill]] while Hill was campaigning across Alabama. He told Hill that his mother was interested in talking to him about his problems and her need to collect Elonzo's [[disability pension]]. With Hill's help, the family began collecting the money.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M|1981|p=27}} Despite his medical condition, the family managed fairly well financially throughout the Great Depression.{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|p=17}}

{{Listen |filename=MyBucket'sGotAHoleIn.ogg |title=My Bucket's Got a Hole in It |description=The popular song "My Bucket's Got a Hole in It" became a hit for Hank Williams in 1949.}}

There are several versions of how Williams got his first guitar. His mother stated that she bought it with money from selling peanuts, but many other prominent residents of the town claimed to have been the one who purchased the guitar for him. While living in Georgiana, Williams met [[Rufus Payne|Rufus "Tee-Tot" Payne]], a street performer. Payne gave Williams guitar lessons in exchange for money or meals prepared by Lillie.{{sfn|Koon, George William|1983|p=13}}{{sfn|Lipsitz, George|1994|p=26}} Payne's base musical style was [[blues]].{{sfn|Campbell, Michael|2012|p=126}} Payne taught Williams chords, chord progressions, bass turns, and the musical style of accompaniment that he would use in most of his future songwriting. Later on, Williams recorded "[[My Bucket's Got a Hole in It]]", one of the songs that Payne taught him.{{sfn|Brackett, David|p=98|2000}} His musical style contained influences from Payne along with several other country influences, among them [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], [[Moon Mullican]], and [[Roy Acuff]].{{sfn|Dicaire, David|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MYMQl9dsKJEC&lpg=PA124&dq=Rufe%20Payne&pg=PA124#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 124]|2007}} In 1937, Williams got into a fight with his physical education teacher about exercises the coach wanted him to do. His mother subsequently demanded that the school board terminate the coach; when they refused, the family moved to [[Montgomery, Alabama]]. Payne and Williams lost touch, though Payne also eventually moved to Montgomery, where he died in poverty in 1939. Williams later credited him as his only teacher.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.alabama.gov/aha/markers/montgomery.html |title=Rufus Payne, 1884–1939|work=The Alabama Historical Association |publisher=The [[Alabama Historical Association]]|date=January 11, 2010 |access-date=March 6, 2011 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214200800/http://www.archives.alabama.gov/aha/markers/montgomery.html|archive-date=February 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Career==
===1930s===
[[File:HankWilliams1938-Cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Williams performing in Montgomery in 1938]]

In July 1937, the Williams and McNeils opened a [[boarding house]] on South Perry Street in downtown Montgomery. It was at this time that Williams decided to change his name informally from Hiram to Hank. Williams told a story in later concerts that attributed his name change to a cat's yowling. The authors of ''Hank Williams: The Biography'' pointed out that "Hank" sounded more "like a hillbilly and western star" than "Hiram".{{sfn|Escott|Merritt|MacEwen|2009|p=21}} During the same year, he participated in a talent show at the Empire Theater. He won the first prize of $15, singing his first original song "WPA Blues". Williams wrote the lyrics and used the tune of [[Riley Puckett]]'s "Dissatisfied".{{sfn|Koon, George William|1983|p=16}}

He never learned to read music; instead he based his compositions in storytelling and personal experience.{{sfn|Browne, Ray Broadus|2005|p=66}}
After school and on weekends, Williams sang and played his [[Silvertone (instruments)|Silvertone]] guitar on the sidewalk in front of the [[WLWI (AM)|WSFA]] radio studio.{{sfn|Koon, George William|1983|p=153}} His recent win at the Empire Theater and the street performances caught the attention of WSFA producers who occasionally invited him to perform on air.{{sfn|Koon, George William|1983|p=16, 17}} So many listeners contacted the radio station asking for more of "the singing kid", possibly influenced by his mother, that the producers hired him to host his own 15-minute show twice a week for a weekly salary of US$15 ({{Inflation|US|15|1937|fmt=eq|r=-2|cursign=$}}).{{sfn|Koon, George William|1983|p=18}}

In August 1938, Elonzo Williams was temporarily released from the hospital. He showed up unannounced at the family's home in Montgomery. Lillie was unwilling to let him reclaim his position as the head of the household. Elonzo stayed to celebrate his son's birthday in September before he returned to the medical center in Louisiana. Williams's mother had claimed that he was dead.{{sfn|Koon, George William|1983|p=153}}

Williams's successful radio show fueled his entry into a music career. His salary was enough for him to start his own band, which he dubbed the [[Drifting Cowboys]]. The original members were guitarist Braxton Schuffert, fiddler Freddie Beach, and comedian Smith "Hezzy" Adair. James E. (Jimmy) Porter was the youngest, being only 13 when he started playing [[steel guitar]] for Williams. Arthur Whiting was also a guitarist for the Drifting Cowboys.{{sfn|Koon, George William|1983|p=11}} The band traveled throughout central and southern Alabama performing in clubs and at private gatherings. James Ellis Garner later played fiddle for him. Lillie Williams became the Drifting Cowboys' manager. Williams dropped out of school in October 1939 so that he and the Drifting Cowboys could work full-time.{{sfn|Koon, George William|1983|p=10}} Lillie Williams began booking show dates, negotiating prices and driving them to some of their shows. Now free to travel without Williams's schooling taking precedence, the band could tour as far away as western Georgia and the [[Florida Panhandle]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2015|p=48}} The band started playing in theaters before the start of the movies and later in [[honky-tonk]]s.{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2015|p=29}} Williams's alcohol use started to become a problem during the tours; on occasion he spent a large part of the show revenues on alcohol. Meanwhile, between tour schedules, Williams returned to Montgomery to host his radio show.{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|p=34}}

===1940s===
[[File:Hank Williams Drifting Cowboys Cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Williams, Sheppard, and the Drifting Cowboys band in 1951]]
The American entry into [[World War II]] in 1941 marked the beginning of hard times for Williams. While he was [[Selective Training and Service Act|medically disqualified from military service]] after suffering a back injury caused by falling from a bull during a [[rodeo]] in [[Texas]], his band members were all [[Selective Training and Service Act|drafted]] to serve. Many of their replacements refused to play in the band due to Williams's worsening alcoholism.{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|p=39}} He continued to show up for his radio show intoxicated, so in August 1942 the WSFA radio station fired him for "habitual drunkenness". During one of his concerts, Williams met his idol, [[Grand Ole Opry]] star [[Roy Acuff]] backstage,{{sfn|Cusic, Don|p=61|2008}} who later warned him of the dangers of alcohol, saying, "You've got a million-dollar talent, son, but a ten-cent brain."{{sfn|Hemphill, Paul|2005|p=40}}

He worked for the rest of the war for a shipbuilding company in [[Mobile, Alabama]], as well as singing in bars for soldiers.{{sfn|Koon, George William|1983|p=16}} In 1943, Williams met [[Audrey Williams|Audrey Sheppard]] at a [[medicine show]] in [[Banks, Alabama]]. Williams and Sheppard lived and worked together in Mobile.{{sfn|Lipsitz, George|1994|p=27}} Sheppard later told Williams that she wanted to move to Montgomery with him and start a band together and help him regain his radio show. The couple were married in 1944 at a Texaco Station in [[Andalusia, Alabama]], by a justice of the peace. The marriage was declared illegal, since Sheppard's divorce from her previous husband did not comply with the legally required 60-day trial reconciliation.{{sfn|Lipsitz, George|1994|p=28}}{{sfn|Koon, George William|1983|p=19}}

In 1945, when he was back in Montgomery, Williams started to perform again for the WSFA radio station. He wrote songs weekly to perform during the shows.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M|1981|p=42}} As a result of the new variety of his repertoire, Williams published his first songbook, ''Original Songs of Hank Williams''.{{sfn|Cusic, Don|p=61|2008}} The book only listed lyrics, since its main purpose was to attract more audiences, though it is also possible that he did not want to pay for transcribing the notes. It included 10 songs: "Mother Is Gone", "Won't You Please Come Back", "My Darling Baby Girl" (with Audrey Sheppard), "Grandad's Musket", "I Just Wish I Could Forget", "[[Let's Turn Back the Years]]", "Honkey-Tonkey", "I Loved No One But You", "A Tramp on the Street", and "You'll Love Me Again".{{sfn|Koon, George William|1983|p=111}} With Williams beginning to be recognized as a songwriter,{{sfn|Williams, Roger M|1981|p=42, 59}} Sheppard became his manager and occasionally accompanied him on duets in some of his live concerts.{{sfn|Ribowsky, Mark|2016|p=156}}

On September 14, 1946, Williams auditioned for Nashville's [[Grand Ole Opry]], but was rejected. After the failure of his audition, Williams and Audrey Sheppard attempted to interest the recently formed music publishing firm [[Acuff-Rose Music]]. Williams and his wife approached [[Fred Rose (songwriter)|Fred Rose]], the president of the company, during one of his habitual ping-pong games at WSM radio studios. Audrey Williams asked Rose if her husband could sing a song for him on that moment,{{sfn|Williams, Roger M|1981|p=59}} Rose agreed, and he liked Williams's musical style.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M|1981|p=60}} Rose signed Williams to a six-song contract, and leveraged this deal to sign Williams with [[Sterling Records (US)|Sterling Records]]. On December 11, 1946, in his first recording session, he recorded "Wealth Won't Save Your Soul", "Calling You", "[[Never Again (Will I Knock on Your Door)]]", and "When God Comes and Gathers His Jewels", which was misprinted as "When God Comes and ''Fathers'' His Jewels".{{sfn|Cusic, Don|p=61|2008}} The recordings "Never Again" and "[[Honky Tonkin']]" became successful, and earned Williams the attention of MGM Records.{{sfn|Young|Young|2010|p=234}}
{{Listen |filename=Lovesick Blues Hank Williams.ogg |title=Lovesick Blues |description=A major hit for Hank Williams, "[[Lovesick Blues]]" moved him to the mainstream of country music and assured him a position in the [[Grand Ole Opry]].}}

Williams signed with [[MGM Records]] in 1947 and released "[[Move It On Over (song)|Move It on Over]]"; considered an [[Origins of rock and roll|early example]] of [[rock and roll]] music, the song became a massive country hit. In 1948, he moved to [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], and he joined the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'', a radio show broadcast that propelled him into living rooms all over the Southeast appearing on weekend shows. Williams eventually started to host a show on [[KWKH]] and started touring across western Louisiana and eastern Texas, always returning on Saturdays for the weekly broadcast of the ''Hayride''.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M|1981|p=70, 71}} After a few more moderate hits, in 1949 he released his version of the 1922 [[Cliff Friend]] and [[Irving Mills]] song "[[Lovesick Blues]]",<ref name=pc9/> made popular by [[Rex Griffin]]. Williams's version became a huge country hit; the song stayed at number one on the ''Billboard'' charts for four consecutive months,<ref>Keillor, Garrison.

===1950s===
[[File:HankWilliams1951concert.jpg|thumb|Williams performing in 1951|left|upright=0.9]]
In 1950, Williams began recording as "Luke the Drifter" for his religious-themed recordings, many of which are recitations rather than singing. Fearful that disc jockeys and jukebox operators would hesitate to accept these unusual recordings, Williams used this alias to avoid hurting the marketability of his name.{{sfn|Ching, Barbara|p=[https://archive.org/details/wrongswhatidobes00chin/page/55 <!-- quote=Luke the drifter. --> p. 55]|2003}} Although the real identity of Luke the Drifter was supposed to be anonymous, Williams often performed part of the material of the recordings on stage. Most of the material was written by Williams himself, in some cases with the help of Fred Rose and his son [[Wesley Rose|Wesley]].{{sfn|Williams, Roger M|1981|p=127}} The songs depicted Luke the Drifter traveling around from place to place, narrating stories of different characters and philosophizing about life.{{sfn|Bernstein|Nunnally|Sabino|1997|p=250}}{{sfn|Peppiatt, Francesca|p=82|2004}} Some of the compositions were accompanied by a [[pipe organ]].{{sfn|Ching, Barbara|p=[https://archive.org/details/wrongswhatidobes00chin/page/55 <!-- quote=Luke the drifter. --> p. 55]|2003}}
Around this time Williams released more hit songs, such as "[[My Son Calls Another Man Daddy]]", "[[They'll Never Take Her Love from Me]]", "[[Why Should We Try Anymore]]", "[[Nobody's Lonesome for Me]]", "[[Long Gone Lonesome Blues]]", "[[Why Don't You Love Me (Hank Williams song)|Why Don't You Love Me]]", "[[Moanin' the Blues]]", and "[[I Just Don't Like This Kind of Living]]".<ref>{{cite web|date=January 13, 1951|work=Billboard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XR8EAAAAMBAJ&q=My%20Son%20Calls%20Another%20Man%20Daddy%22%2C%20%22They'll%20Never%20Take%20Her%20Love%20from%20Me%22%2C%20%22Why%20Should%20We%20Try%20Any%20More%3F%22%2C%20%22Nobody's%20Lonesome%20for%20Me%22%2C%20%22Long%20Gone%20Lonesome%20Blues%22%2C%20%22Why%20Don't%20You%20Love%20Me%3F%22%2C%20%22Moanin'%20the%20Blues%22%20and%20%22I%20Just%20Don't%20Like%20This%20Kind%20of%20Livin'&pg=PA19 |title=The Year's Top Country and Western Records|page=9}}</ref> In 1951, "[[Dear John (Hank Williams song)|Dear John]]" became a hit, but it was the [[A-side and B-side|flip side]], "[[Cold, Cold Heart]]", that became one of his most recognized songs. A pop cover version by [[Tony Bennett]] released the same year stayed on the charts for 27 weeks, peaking at number one.{{sfn|Whitburn, Joel|p=26|1991}}

Williams's career reached a peak in the late summer of 1951 with his [[Hadacol]] tour of the U.S. with [[Bob Hope]] and other actors. On the weekend after the tour ended, Williams was photographed backstage at the Grand Ole Opry signing a motion picture deal with [[MGM]].{{sfn|Escott, Colin|Merritt, George|MacEwen, William|2015|p=198}} In October, Williams recorded a demo, "[[There's a Tear in My Beer]]" for a friend, "[[Big Bill Lister]]", who recorded it in the studio.{{sfn|Escott|Merritt|MacEwen|2009|p=180-181}} On November 14, 1951, Williams flew to New York with his steel guitar player Don Helms where he appeared on television for the first time on ''[[The Perry Como Show]]''. There he and [[Perry Como]] sang "Hey Good Lookin'".{{sfn|Escott|Merritt|MacEwen|2009|p=191-193}}

In November 1951, Williams suffered a fall during a hunting trip with his fiddler Jerry Rivers in [[Franklin, Tennessee]]. The fall reactivated his old back pains. He later started to consume painkillers, including morphine, and alcohol to help ease the pain.<ref name="aol"/> On May 21, he had been admitted to North Louisiana Sanitarium for the treatment of his alcoholism, leaving on May 24.{{sfn|Koon, George William|1983|p=153, 154}} On December 13, 1951, he had a spinal fusion at the [[Vanderbilt University Medical Center|Vanderbilt University Hospital]], being released on December 24.{{sfn|Koon, George William|p=153, 154|1983}} During his recovery, he lived with his mother in Montgomery, and later moved to Nashville with [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]].{{sfn|Wolff, Kurt|p=160|2000}}

During the spring of 1952, Williams flew to New York with steel guitarist Don Helms, where he made two appearances with other Grand Ole Opry members on ''[[The Kate Smith Show]]''. He sang "[[Cold, Cold Heart]]", "[[Hey Good Lookin' (song)|Hey Good Lookin']]'", "Glory Bound Train" and "[[I Saw the Light (Hank Williams song)|I Saw the Light]]" with other cast members, and a duet, "[[I Can't Help It (If I'm Still in Love with You)]]" with [[Anita Carter]].{{sfn|Escott|Merritt|MacEwen|2009|p=211}} That same year, Williams had a brief extramarital affair with dancer Bobbie Jett, with whom he fathered a daughter, [[Jett Williams]].{{sfn|Escott|Merritt|MacEwen|2009|p=226, 227}}

In June 1952, he recorded "[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)]]", "Window Shopping", "Settin' the Woods on Fire", and "I'll Never Get out of this World Alive". Audrey Williams divorced him that year; the next day he recorded "You Win Again" and "I Won't be Home No More". Around this time, he met [[Billie Jean Horton|Billie Jean Jones]], a girlfriend of country singer [[Faron Young]], at the Grand Ole Opry. As a girl, Jones had lived down the street from Williams when he was with the Louisiana Hayride, and now Williams began to visit her frequently in Shreveport, causing him to miss many Grand Ole Opry appearances.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M|1981|p=201-204}}

On August 11, 1952, Williams was dismissed from the Grand Ole Opry for habitual drunkenness and missing shows. He returned to Shreveport, Louisiana, to perform on [[KWKH]] and [[WBAM]] shows and in the ''Louisiana Hayride'', for which he toured again. His performances were acclaimed when he was sober, but despite the efforts of his work associates to get him to shows sober, his abuse of alcohol resulted in occasions when he did not appear or his performances were poor.{{sfn|Lornell |Laird|2008|p=82}} In October 1952 he married Billie Jean Jones.{{sfn|Koon, George William|1983|p=70}}

During his last recording session on September 23, 1952, Williams recorded "[[Kaw-Liga (song)|Kaw-Liga]]", along with "[[Your Cheatin' Heart]]", "[[Take These Chains from My Heart]]", and "I Could Never be Ashamed of You". Due to Williams's excesses, Fred Rose stopped working with him. By the end of 1952, Williams had started to suffer heart problems.<ref name="aol"/> He met Horace "Toby" Marshall in [[Oklahoma City]], who said that he was a doctor. Marshall had been previously convicted for forgery, and had been paroled and released from the [[Oklahoma State Penitentiary]] in 1951. Among other fake titles, he said that he was a [[Doctor of Science]]. He purchased the DSC title for $25 from the ''Chicago School of Applied Science''; in the diploma, he requested that the DSC be spelled out as "Doctor of Science and Psychology". Under the name of Dr. C. W. Lemon he prescribed Williams with [[amphetamines]], [[Seconal]], [[chloral hydrate]], and [[morphine]], which made his heart problems worse.{{sfn|Koon, George William|p=74|1983}} His final concert was held in Austin, Texas, at the Skyline Club on December 19.{{sfn|Pugh, Ronnie|1998|p=191}}

==Personal life==
On December 15, 1944, Williams married [[Audrey Williams|Audrey Sheppard]]. It was her second marriage and his first. Their son, Randall Hank Williams (now known as [[Hank Williams Jr.]]), was born on May 26, 1949. The marriage was always turbulent and rapidly disintegrated, and Williams developed serious problems with alcohol, morphine, and other painkillers prescribed for him to ease the severe back pain caused by his [[spina bifida occulta]].{{sfn|Koon, George William|1983|p=10}} The couple divorced on May 29, 1952.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M|1981|p=96}} In June 1952, Williams moved in with his mother, even as he released numerous hit songs such as "[[Half as Much]]" in April, "[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)]]" in July, "[[You Win Again (Hank Williams song)|You Win Again]]" in September, and "I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive" in November. His substance abuse problems continued to spiral out of control as he moved to Nashville and officially divorced Sheppard.{{sfn|Koon, George William|1983|p=XII}} A relationship with a woman named Bobbie Jett during this period resulted in a daughter, [[Jett Williams]], who was born five days after Williams died. His mother adopted Jett, who was made a ward of the state and then adopted by another couple after her grandmother died. Jett did not learn that she was Williams's daughter until the early 1980s.{{sfn|Williams |Roberts |p=127|2010}}

On October 18, 1952, Williams and [[Billie Jean Jones]] were married by a justice of the peace{{sfn|Celon, Curtis|p=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780878057221/page/80 <!-- quote=Andrew Johnson Hotel hank williams. --> 80]|1995}} in [[Minden, Louisiana]].{{sfn|Koon, George William|1983|p=70}} It was the second marriage for both (each being divorced with children).{{sfn|Koon, George William|1983|p=70}} The next day, two public ceremonies were held at the New Orleans Civic Auditorium, where 14,000 seats were sold for each.{{sfn|Celon, Curtis|p=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780878057221/page/80 <!-- quote=Andrew Johnson Hotel hank williams. --> 80]|1995}} After Williams's death, a judge ruled that the wedding was not legal because Jones' divorce had not become final until 11 days after she married Williams. His first wife and his mother were the driving forces behind having the marriage declared invalid, and they pursued the matter for years. Williams had also married Sheppard before her divorce was final, on the 10th day of a required 60-day reconciliation period.{{sfn|Williams, Roger M|1981|p=46}}

During the [[1952 United States presidential election|1952 presidential election]], Williams was a vocal supporter of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. According to singer [[Jo Stafford]], Williams sent Eisenhower a birthday telegram on October 14, informing him that he considered it a personal honor to endorse a military figure to lead the nation in its coming future. Eisenhower was sworn in as president 19 days after Williams's death.{{sfn|Weston, Paul|2012|p=195}}

A man named Lewis Fitzgerald (born 1943) claimed to be Williams's illegitimate son; he was the son of Marie McNeil, Williams's cousin.{{sfn|Ribowsky, Mark|2016|p=43}} In 2005, the [[BBC]] documentary series ''[[Arena (British TV series)|Arena]]'' featured an episode on Williams.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hank Williams - Honky Tonk Blues|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074sf6|work=BBC|date=February 5, 2005|access-date=February 10, 2021}}</ref> Fitzgerald was interviewed, and he suggested that Lillie Williams operated a brothel at her boarding house in Montgomery. A friend of the family denied his claims, but singer [[Billy Walker (musician)|Billy Walker]] remembered that Williams mentioned to him the presence of men in the house being led upstairs.{{sfn|Ribowsky, Mark|2016|p=43}}

Williams was scheduled to perform at the [[Charleston Municipal Auditorium|Municipal Auditorium]] in [[Charleston, West Virginia]], on December 31, 1952. Advance ticket sales totaled $3,500. That day, Williams could not fly because of an ice storm in the Nashville area; he hired a college student, Charles Carr, to drive him to the concerts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessatlanta.com/news/entertainment/hank-williams-last-ride-driver-recalls-lonesome-en/nYbpz/ |title=Hank Williams' last ride: Driver recalls lonesome end |first=Jim |last=Tharpe |website=AccessAtlanta.com |date=July 2, 2013 |access-date=June 13, 2016}}</ref> Carr called the Charleston auditorium from Knoxville to say that Williams would not arrive on time owing to the ice storm and was instead ordered to drive Williams to [[Canton, Ohio]], for a New Year's Day concert there.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wvculture.org/goldenseal/winter02/hankshow.html |title=Hank's Lost Charleston Show |first=John |last=Lilly |publisher=West Virginia Division of Culture and History |access-date=March 8, 2011}}</ref> The two arrived at the [[Andrew Johnson Building|Andrew Johnson Hotel]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], and Carr requested a doctor for Williams, who was affected by the combination of the [[chloral hydrate]] and alcohol he had drunk on the way to Knoxville.{{sfn|Olson, Ted|2004|p=296}} Dr. P. H. Cardwell injected Williams with two shots of [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] that also contained a quarter-grain of [[morphine]]. Carr and Williams checked out of the hotel, but the porters had to carry Williams to the car as he was coughing and hiccuping.{{sfn|Olson, Ted|2004|p=298}}

At around midnight on January 1, 1953, when the two crossed the Tennessee state line and arrived in [[Bristol, Virginia]], Carr stopped at a small all-night restaurant and asked Williams if he wanted to eat. Williams said he did not, and those are believed to be his last words.{{sfn|Olson, Ted|2004|p=300}} Carr later drove on until he stopped for fuel at a gas station in [[Oak Hill, West Virginia]], where he realized that Williams had been dead for so long that [[rigor mortis]] had already set in. The station's owner called the local police chief.{{sfn|Olson, Ted|2004|p=303}} In Williams's Cadillac, the police found some empty beer cans and unfinished handwritten lyrics.{{sfn|Koon, George William|1983|p=79}} Dr. Ivan Malinin performed the [[autopsy]] at the Tyree Funeral House.

After [[Hawkshaw Hawkins]] and other performers started singing Williams's song "[[I Saw the Light (Hank Williams song)|I Saw the Light]]" as a tribute to him, the crowd realized that he was indeed dead and began to sing along.{{sfn|Celon, Curtis|p=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780878057221/page/80 <!-- quote=Andrew Johnson Hotel hank williams. --> 80]|1995}}

On January 2, Williams's body was transported to [[Montgomery, Alabama]], where it was placed in a silver casket that was displayed at his mother's boarding house for two days. His funeral took place on January 4 at the Montgomery Auditorium, with his casket placed on the flower-covered stage.{{sfn|Stanton, Scott|2003|p=[https://archive.org/details/tombstonetourist00stan_0/page/262 <!-- quote=hank williams funeral boarding house silver. --> p. 262]}} An estimated 15,000 to 25,000 people passed by the silver casket, and the auditorium was filled with 2,750 mourners.{{sfn|Peterson, Richard A.|1997|p=182}} His funeral was said to have been far larger than any ever held for any other citizen of Alabama, and the largest event ever held in Montgomery.{{sfn|Sheckler Finch, Jackie|2011|p=72, 73}}<ref>{{cite book |title=Hank Williams Trail Brochure |url=http://alabama.travel/trails/hank-williams-trail|work=Alabama Tourism Department |access-date=March 14, 2011 |publisher=Alabama Tourism Department}}</ref> Williams's remains are interred at the Oakwood Annex in Montgomery. The president of [[MGM Records]] told ''Billboard'' magazine that the company got only about five requests for pictures of Williams during the weeks before his death, but over 300 afterwards. The local record shops reportedly sold all their Williams records, and customers were asking for all records ever released by Williams.{{sfn|Peterson, Richard A.|1997|p=182}}

Williams's final single, released in November 1952 while he was still alive, was titled "[[I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive]]". His song "Your Cheatin' Heart" was written and recorded in September 1952, but released in late January 1953 after his death. The song, backed by "[[Kaw-Liga]]", was No. 1 on the country charts for six weeks. It provided the title for the [[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|1964 biographical film of the same name]], which starred [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] as Williams.{{sfn|Koon, George William|1983|p=161}} "Take These Chains From My Heart" was released in April 1953 and reached No. 1 on the country charts.{{sfn|Koon, George William|1983|p=128}} Released in July, "I Won't Be Home No More" went to No. 4.

In 2006, a janitor of [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]] found in a dumpster the unfinished lyrics written by Williams that had been found in his car the night he died.

Material recorded by Williams, originally intended for radio broadcasts to be played when he was on tour or for its distribution to radio stations nationwide, resurfaced throughout time.{{sfn|Koon, George William|1983|pp=153–154}} In 1993, a double-disc set of recordings of Williams for the ''Health & Happiness Show'' was released.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/health-happiness-shows-mw0000093617 |title=Health and Happiness Show |work=Allmusic |publisher=Rovi Corporation |access-date=May 26, 2014}}</ref> Broadcast in 1949, the shows were recorded for the promotion of Hadacol. The set was re-released on ''Hank Williams: The Legend Begins'' in 2011. The album included unreleased songs. "Fan It" and "[[Alexander's Ragtime Band]]", recorded by Williams at age 15; the homemade recordings of him singing "Freight Train Blues", "[[New San Antonio Rose]]", "[[Saint Louis Blues (song)|St. Louis Blues]]" and "Greenback Dollar" at age 18; and a recording for the 1951 [[March of Dimes]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/nashville-skyline/1670831/nashville-skyline-johnny-cash-and-hank-williams-got-some-more-music-here.jhtml |title=Nashville Skyline: Johnny Cash and Hank Williams: Got Some More Music Here |date=September 15, 2011 |first=Chet |last=Flippo |work=Country Music Television |access-date=May 26, 2014}}</ref> In May 2014, further radio recordings by Williams were released. ''[[The Garden Spot Programs, 1950]]'', a series of publicity segments for plant nursery Naughton Farms originally aired in 1950. The recordings were found by collector George Gimarc at radio station [[KSIB (AM)|KSIB]] in [[Creston, Iowa]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/03/28/hank-williams-unreleased-garden-spot-mind-your-own-business/7001777/ |title=Hear a newly discovered Hank Williams performance |work=USA Today |date=March 28, 2014}}</ref> Gimarc contacted Williams's daughter Jett, and Colin Escott, writer of a biography book on Williams.

===Lawsuits over the estate===
After Williams's death, Audrey Williams filed a suit in Nashville against MGM Records and [[Acuff-Rose Music|Acuff-Rose]]. The suit demanded that both of the publishing companies continue to pay her half of the royalties from Hank Williams's records. Williams had an agreement giving his first wife half of the royalties, but allegedly there was no clarification that the deal was valid after his death. Because Williams may have left no will, the disposition of the remaining 50 percent was considered uncertain; those involved included Williams's second wife, [[Billie Jean Horton]] and her daughter, and Williams's mother and sister.<ref>{{cite journal |title=File Action to Untangle Hank Williams Estate |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=March 13, 2011 |issn=0006-2510 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EQ0EAAAAMBAJ&q=audrey%20hank%20williams%20billboard%20suit&pg=PA15 |page=15 |date=May 23, 1953 }}</ref> On October 22, 1975, a federal judge in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, ruled Horton's marriage to Williams was valid and that half of Williams's future royalties belonged to her.{{sfn|Koon, George William|1983|p=247}}

====WSM's ''Mother's Best Flour''====
In 1951, Williams hosted a 15-minute show for ''Mother's Best Flour'' on WSM radio. Due to Williams's tour schedules, some of the shows were previously recorded to be played in his absence.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/28/entertainment/et-backtracking28 |title=There's Plenty Cookin' |work=Los Angeles Times |date=October 28, 2008 |last=Hilbourn |first=Robert |access-date=March 14, 2011}}</ref> The original acetates made their way to the possession of Jett Williams. Prior to that, duplicates were made and intended to be published by a third party. In February 2005, the [[Tennessee Court of Appeals]] upheld a lower court ruling stating that Williams's heirs—son, [[Hank Williams Jr]], and daughter, [[Jett Williams]]—have the sole rights to sell his recordings made for a Nashville radio station in 1951.

The court rejected claims made by [[PolyGram Records]] and Legacy Entertainment in releasing recordings Williams made for the ''Mother's Best Flour Show''. The recordings, which Legacy Entertainment acquired in 1997, include live versions of Williams's hits and his cover version of other songs. PolyGram contended that Williams's contract with MGM Records, whose back catalogue they owned at the time, prior to current owner [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music's]] absorption of PolyGram the next year, gave them rights to release the radio recordings. A 3-CD selection of the tracks, restored by Joe Palmaccio, was released by [[Time-Life]] in October 2008 titled ''The Unreleased Recordings''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-ragogna/mothers-best-hanks-best-a_b_781999.html |title=Mother's Best, Hank's Best: A Conversation With Jett Williams and the Students |author=Mike Ragogna |work=The Huffington Post |publisher=AOL |date=November 11, 2011}}</ref>
