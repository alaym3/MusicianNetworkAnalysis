==Genre==
Since the beginning of his career, Ghostpoet has avoided identifying his music as belonging to a particular genre. In March 2018, during his European tour, many venues started listing Ghostpoet as "hip hop" or "trip hop". Ghostpoet promoted the events via Twitter, always including a declaration along the lines of "I am not Hip Hop".

On 7 March 2018, when challenged by a fan via Twitter with the question "WHAT are you?", Ghostpoet responded: "So Interesting. Why is it so important for me to be part of a predetermined genre with its parameters and rules? I'm just an artist who experiments with sounds and loves guitars. It's ok to be confused, not everything in life needs explanation, sometimes we just have to go with it".

In recent times Ghostpoet has grown more comfortable with his increasing connection to the [[alternative rock]] and [[electronica]] genres.
