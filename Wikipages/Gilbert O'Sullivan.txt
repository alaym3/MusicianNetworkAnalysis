O'Sullivan's songs are often marked by his distinctive, percussive piano playing style<ref name="Sodajerker"/> and observational lyrics using word play.<ref name="Interview: Gilbert O Sullivan"/>

Born in [[Waterford]], Ireland, O'Sullivan settled in [[Swindon]], England, as a child. In 1967, O'Sullivan began pursuing a career in music. Worldwide, he has charted 16 top 40 records including six No. 1 songs, the first of which was 1970's "[[Nothing Rhymed]]". Across his career, he has recorded 19 studio albums, up to his UK top 20 self-titled record in 2018.

In 1967, O'Sullivan moved from Swindon to [[London]] in pursuit of a career in music. Determined to get a record deal and looking to stand out, he created an eye-catching visual image comprised a pudding basin haircut, cloth cap and short trousers. O'Sullivan has said his love of [[silent film]] inspired the look.<ref>{{cite news|title=Still singing, naturally|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/still-singing-naturally-1.292528|access-date=27 August 2020|date=20 March 2001}}</ref> He scored a five-year contract with April Music, [[CBS Records International|CBS Records']] house publishing company, after coming to the attention of the professional manager Stephen Shane,<ref>'In 1967 ... [h]e took a part-time Christmas job at the C&A Department store on Oxford Street. While there, a colleague brought his tapes to the attention of the CBS record company executives. They liked what they heard, and he was signed up.' ''Ireland's Own'', 12 June 2015, No. 5501, pg 9</ref> who also suggested changing his name from Ray to Gilbert as a play on the name of the operetta composers [[Gilbert & Sullivan]]. He was paid an advance of £12 (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{inflation|UK|12|1967|r=-2}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}), with which he bought a piano. He was signed to CBS Records by the [[A&R]] manager Mike Smith, who produced [[the Tremeloes]], [[the Marmalade]] and [[Love Affair (band)|the Love Affair]].

His first single was "Disappear", produced by Mike Smith and released in November 1967 credited to the mononym 'Gilbert'. It failed to chart, as did his second single "What Can I Do", released in April 1968.  A switch to the Irish record label [[Major Minor Records|Major Minor]] in 1969 yielded a third single  "Mr. Moody's Garden", again unsuccessful. O'Sullivan then sent some demo tapes to [[Gordon Mills]], the manager of [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] and [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]], whereupon O'Sullivan was signed to Mills' newly founded label, MAM Records. Mills reportedly hated O'Sullivan's self-created image, but O'Sullivan insisted on using it initially.<ref name="Record Mirror">{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Peter |title=Gilbert O'Sullivan |journal=Record Mirror |date=20 March 1974 |page=14 |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/UK/Record-Mirror/70s/74/Record-Mirror-1974-04-20.pdf |access-date=9 June 2020}}</ref> O'Sullivan's unique signature look garnered much attention, and often saw him compared to the [[Bisto|Bisto Kids]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ingle|first1=Roisin|title=Himself Again Naturally|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/himself-again-naturally-1.1211786|access-date=29 March 2018|date=23 June 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Gilbert O'Sullivan|url=http://www.salvo-music.co.uk/artists/artistmaintop.asp?MArID=328|website=Salvo|access-date=29 March 2018}}</ref> O'Sullivan explained his thinking behind his appearance in a 1971 interview: "My mother probably doesn't like [[Neil Young]] because she hates the way he looks, his hair and everything. If you can get them interested in the way you look then they tend to like the music. The thing which I'm trying to create is of the thirties; [[Buster Keaton|Keaton]] and [[Charlie Chaplin|Chaplin]]".<ref name="The Working Class Hero">{{cite web|last1=Watts|first1=Michael|title=The Working Class Hero|url=http://gilbertosullivan.net/in_print/melody_maker_01.htm|website=Gilbert O'Sullivan|access-date=24 August 2020}}</ref>

===Early success===
At the end of 1970, O'Sullivan achieved his first UK [[Top 40|top 10]] hit with "[[Nothing Rhymed]]",<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> which also reached [[chart-topper|No. 1]] in the [[Netherlands]],<ref name="Top40/">{{cite web|url=http://www.top40.nl/top40/1971/week-08|title=Top40 Chart|website=Top40.nl|access-date=27 October 2017}}</ref> where it earned O'Sullivan his first [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/> Over 1971, O'Sullivan scored hits with "Underneath The Blanket Go" (which also reached [[chart-topper|No. 1]] in the Netherlands), "[[We Will (song)|We Will]]" and "No Matter How I Try", the latter being named "Best Ballad or Romantic Song" at the 17th Ivor Novello Awards in 1972.<ref>{{cite web|title=1972|url=http://theivors.com/archive/1970-1979/the-ivors-1972/|website=The Ivors|access-date=3 April 2018}}</ref> O'Sullivan released his debut album, ''[[Himself (Gilbert O'Sullivan album)|Himself]]'', in August 1971.<ref name="AMG"/> It received a warm critical reception, with O'Sullivan's observational and conversational style of songwriting garnering comparisons to [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Randy Newman]].<ref name="The Working Class Hero" /><ref name="NME - Gilbert O'Sullivan">{{cite web|last1=Norman|first1=Tony|title=NME - Gilbert O'Sullivan|url=http://www.gilbertosullivan.net/in_print/new_musical_01.htm|website=Gilbert O'Sullivan|access-date=24 August 2020}}</ref> O'Sullivan opted not to tour in promotion of the album, but did however make a number of appearances on British television during 1971, most notably recording an edition of ''[[BBC]] In Concert'' broadcast 18 December 1971.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gilbert O'Sullivan In Concert|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/0425a555586d4f04b57fb7ae4c86fbdb|website=BBC Genome|access-date=22 April 2018}}</ref>

[[File:GilbertOSullivan1972.jpg|thumb|200px|left|O'Sullivan in 1972]]In 1972, O'Sullivan achieved major international [[celebrity|stardom]] with "[[Alone Again (Naturally)]]", a [[Sentimental ballad|ballad]] which touches upon [[suicide]] and loss. It reached No. 3 in the UK, No. 1 in the US (spending six non-consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]] and selling nearly two million copies), No. 2 in New Zealand (11 weeks on the charts in total), No. 1 in Canada for 2 weeks (13 weeks in the Top 40);<ref name="Webfitz">[http://www.webfitz.com/lyrics/Charts/1972]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref> and No. 1 in Japan (21 weeks on the chart). In total US sales for 1972, O'Sullivan's hit was topped only by [[Roberta Flack]]'s "[[The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face]]". Both songs were nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in the [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] categories in 1973, but Flack won both. This international success coincided with O'Sullivan discarding the appearance he'd used since 1967. He unveiled a more modern 'college-like' look in which he often wore a [[sweater]] bearing a large letter 'G'.<ref name="AMG"/> This was a deliberate attempt to prevent "[making] an impact like [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]]" in the US that "would have taken years to shake off," and the subsequent American edition of ''Himself'', which included "Alone Again (Naturally)", featured an updated image of O'Sullivan on the album artwork.<ref name="Gambaccini">{{cite magazine|last1=Gambaccini|first1=Paul|title=Gilbert O: He Knows He's a Mechanical Man|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=2 August 1973|url=http://www.gilbertosullivan.net/images/InPrint/in_print_rolling_stone_02.jpg|access-date=4 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315103602/http://www.gilbertosullivan.net/images/InPrint/in_print_rolling_stone_02.jpg|archive-date=15 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> O'Sullivan followed up on the success of "Alone Again (Naturally)" with "[[Clair (song)|Clair]]", which reached No. 2 in the United States on the Hot 100 and No. 1 in the UK, Norway, France, Belgium, Ireland and Canada (14 weeks in the Canadian Top 40).<ref name="Webfitz"/><ref>https://tsort.info/music/v64raf.htm</ref> Its parent album (and O'Sullivan's second), ''[[Back to Front (Gilbert O'Sullivan album)|Back to Front]]'', spawned a further hit with "[[Out of the Question (Gilbert O'Sullivan song)|Out of the Question]]", which reached No. 17 in the US and No. 14 in Canada.<ref name="Webfitz"/> 
O'Sullivan's [[gramophone record|disc]] sales exceeded ten million in 1972 and made him the top star of the year.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/> O'Sullivan's success led to his taking part in the [[BBC]]'s anniversary programme ''Fifty Years of Music'' in November 1972. O'Sullivan was ranked by ''[[Record Mirror]]'' as the number 1 male singer of 1972,<ref>{{cite web|title=Flashback 1972: Gilbert O'Sullivan mobbed on Irish return|url=https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/music-news/flashback-1972-gilbert-osullivan-mobbed-on-irish-return-34148933.html|website=Independent.ie|access-date=2 May 2018|date=1 November 2005}}</ref> and in May 1973, he won an [[Ivor Novello]] award for "British Songwriter of the Year."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Ivors 1973|url=http://theivors.com/archive/1970-1979/the-ivors-1973/|website=The Ivors|access-date=2 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807135120/http://theivors.com/archive/1970-1979/the-ivors-1973/|archive-date=7 August 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

1973 saw the release of O'Sullivan's third album, ''[[I'm a Writer, Not a Fighter]]'', which reflected a new emphasis on [[rock music]] and [[funk]] influences. Its lead single, the [[electric keyboard]]-based "Get Down", reached No. 1 in the UK, Belgium and Germany,<ref>https://tsort.info/music/v64raf.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chartsurfer.de/artist/gilbert-o-sullivan/get-down-song_vrgg.html|title=Get Down von Gilbert O'Sullivan|last=Chartsurfer.de|website=Chartsurfer.de|access-date=27 October 2017}}</ref> No. 7 in both the US and Canada, and No. 3 in the Netherlands.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/><ref name="Webfitz"/> Following "Alone Again (Naturally)" and "Clair", "Get Down" was O'Sullivan's third million-seller, with the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] gold disc award presented on 18 September 1973.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/> His November 1974 single "Christmas Song" reached No. 12 in the UK and No. 5 in Ireland.

O'Sullivan enjoyed nearly five years of success with MAM, a run that included seven UK top 10 singles and four UK top 10 albums; three US top 10 singles and one top 10 album; five Dutch top 10 singles and three top 10 albums; five New Zealand top 10 singles; three Canadian top 10 singles; and seven Japan top 10 singles.<ref name="Gilbert">{{cite web |url=http://www.gilbertosullivan.com |title=The Official Gilbert O'Sullivan Website – A Friend of Mine |publisher=Gilbertosullivan.com |access-date=22 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050811074659/http://www.gilbertosullivan.com/ |archive-date=11 August 2005 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> By 1974, his sales were decreasing.<ref name="AMG"/> His fourth album ''[[A Stranger In My Own Back Yard]]'', was his first to miss the top five on the [[UK Albums Chart]], charting at No. 9. Its lead single, "A Woman's Place", generated controversy due to its lyric ("I believe / A woman's place is in the home"), seen by some as [[sexism|sexist]]. It was O'Sullivan's first single since his 1970 breakthrough to miss the top 40 of the [[UK Singles Chart]], reaching a peak of No. 42.<ref name="Official Charts - Gilbert O'Sullivan">{{cite web|title=Gilbert O'Sullivan|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/17499/gilbert-osullivan/|website=Official Charts|access-date=25 August 2020}}</ref> In June 1975, O'Sullivan had his last top 20 hit, "I Don't Love You But I Think I Like You".<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/><ref name="AMG"/>

Gilbert released a fifth album with MAM in 1977, ''[[Southpaw (album)|Southpaw]]'', but it failed to chart. O'Sullivan discovered his recording contract with MAM Records greatly favoured the label's owner, Gordon Mills.  A lawsuit followed, with prolonged argument over how much money his songs had earned and how much of that money he had actually received.<ref name="500 Number One Hits">{{cite book

Although he had won, the court battle put his [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] career on hold.{{cn|date=November 2021}}

===Later career===
In 1980, after a five-year hiatus, he returned to his old record label, CBS.

The first single, "What's in a Kiss?", reached No. 19 in the UK in 1980 and No. 21 in Japan.<ref name="Gilbert"/> It was his first UK top 20 hit in five years. Following this release, and due in part to the then-ongoing MAM court case, O'Sullivan released no new material between 1983 and 1986.<ref name="AMG"/> Apart from the single "So What?" in 1990 and a [[compilation album]] in 1991, ''Nothing But the Best'', O'Sullivan was absent from the charts until another compilation album, ''The Berry Vest of Gilbert O'Sullivan'', returned him to the UK top 20 in 2004.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/>

O'Sullivan is also noted for his role in bringing about the practice of clearing samples in [[hip hop music]] as a result of the 1991 court case, [[Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records, Inc.]],<ref>''[[Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records, Inc.]]'', [[Case citation|780 F. Supp. 182]] ([[S.D.N.Y.]] 1991)</ref> in which he sued [[rapping|rapper]] [[Biz Markie]] over the rights to use a [[sampling (music)|sample]] of his song "Alone Again (Naturally)".<ref name="AMG"/> He won 100% of the royalties and made sampling an expensive undertaking.<ref name="Grauiad-1">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/aug/25/gilbert-o-sullivan-reappraisal|title=Gilbert O'Sullivan: time for a reappraisal?|last=Stanley|first=Bob|date=25 August 2011|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=11 March 2017}}</ref>

O'Sullivan has continued to record and perform into the 21st century. He enjoys [[Big in Japan (phrase)|particular acclaim in Japan]].<ref name="AMG"/> His album ''A Scruff at Heart'' was released in 2007, featuring "Just So You Know". On 14 July 2008, O'Sullivan released "Never Say Di". He appeared at the [[Glastonbury Festival 2008|2008 Glastonbury Festival]], and played London's [[Royal Albert Hall]] on 26 October 2009. On 26 August 2010, O'Sullivan announced that he had joined Hypertension, a record company whose artists have included [[Leo Sayer]], [[Chris DeBurgh]], [[Fleetwood Mac]] and [[Gerry Rafferty]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hypertension-music.de/?page_id=3 |title=Hypertension " Artists |publisher=Hypertension-music.de |access-date=2015-08-26}}</ref>

His album ''Gilbertville'' was released on 31 January 2011; it featured "All They Wanted to Say", which dealt with the 2001 [[September 11 attacks|attacks on the World Trade Center]], and his single "Where Would We Be (Without Tea)?". On 19 July 2011, O'Sullivan played live on the [[BBC Radio 2]] [[Ken Bruce]] Show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b012hkht |title=BBC Radio 2 – Ken Bruce, 19/07/2011 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=19 July 2011 |access-date=22 April 2013}}</ref> On 26 August that year, the documentary ''Out on His Own'' was broadcast by BBC 4 (before by Irish RTÉ). In March 2012, the compilation album ''Gilbert O'Sullivan: The Very Best Of – A Singer & His Songs'' entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 12. 2015 saw Gilbert re-emerge on Irish and BBC radio and television. He toured Ireland beginning of June, and on 8 June 2015 his Peggy Lee-inspired new album ''Latin ala G!'' was released.

On 24 August 2018, O'Sullivan released his 19th studio album ''Gilbert O'Sullivan''. The album entered the UK Album Chart at No. 20, his first UK charting studio album for over 40 years.

==Personal life==
O'Sullivan purposely avoided dating at the peak of his career; he feared that doing so would inhibit his songwriting abilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gilbertosullivan.net/in_print/rolling_stone_02.htm |title=Gilbert O'Sullivan &#124; In Print |website=Gilbertosullivan.net |date=1973-08-02 |access-date=2016-10-08}}</ref> In January 1980, O'Sullivan married his [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] girlfriend Aase Brekke.
