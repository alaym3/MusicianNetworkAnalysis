In 2005 the band recorded their next album ''3rd Draft'', however its release was denied by the label after [[Geffen Records|Geffen]] bought out DreamWorks.

After several years of sporadic touring, the band's fifth studio album ''[[Always and Forever (Alien Ant Farm album)|Always and Forever]]'' was released in February 2015.

===''ANThology'' (2001–2002)===

[[file:Alien Ant Farm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Alien Ant Farm in 2001]]
In 2001, their cover of [[Michael Jackson]]'s song, "[[Smooth Criminal (Alien Ant Farm song)|Smooth Criminal]]", was a No. 1 single in Australia and New Zealand, a No.&nbsp;3 single in the UK, and No.&nbsp;1 on the US [[Alternative Airplay|Modern Rock charts]]. The music video features numerous homages to Michael Jackson and his videos. Corso, the band's guitarist, addressed this in an MTV interview on the set of the music video, saying, "We want to pay homage to Michael Jackson, but on our level. Obviously we're not that glitzy, so we just want to tastefully take the stuff that's cool in his videos and apply it in our own dirty little backyard way."

The song appeared on the soundtrack of the first season of ''[[WWE Tough Enough]]'' and in the film ''[[American Pie 2]]''. Their following single "[[Movies (Alien Ant Farm song)|Movies]]" was a Top 5 hit in the UK and a Top 20 hit in New Zealand. The band began touring in promotion of these two singles and their album, which later went [[platinum]].

In spring of 2002, the band contributed "Bug Bytes" to the first [[Music from and Inspired by Spider-Man|''Spider-Man'' soundtrack]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1452991/sum-41-alien-ant-farm-spin-songs-for-spider-man/ |title=Sum 41, Alien Ant Farm Spin Songs For 'Spider-Man' |last=Dangelo |first=Joe |date=March 20, 2002 |website=MTV.com |access-date=March 3, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303225137/http://www.mtv.com/news/1452991/sum-41-alien-ant-farm-spin-songs-for-spider-man/ |archive-date=March 3, 2018 }}</ref>

In May 2002, the band was involved in a bus accident while touring in Spain.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1454457/alien-ant-farm-injured-in-bus-accident/ |title=Alien Ant Farm Injured In Bus Accident |last=Dangelo |first=Joe |date=May 22, 2002 |website=MTV.com |access-date=March 3, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303225118/http://www.mtv.com/news/1454457/alien-ant-farm-injured-in-bus-accident/ |archive-date=March 3, 2018 }}</ref> While the whole band suffered minor injuries, the driver, 26-year-old Christopher Holland, was killed, and lead singer Mitchell suffered a fractured [[C2 vertebra]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/75599/alien-ant-farm-recovering-after-bus-accident |title=Alien Ant Farm Recovering After Bus Accident |date=May 30, 2002 |website=Billboard.com |access-date=March 3, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121072957/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/75599/alien-ant-farm-recovering-after-bus-accident |archive-date=November 21, 2015 }}</ref><ref name="BBC">{{Cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2003255.stm |title=Alien Ant Farm driver dies in crash |date=May 22, 2002 |website=BBC.co.uk |access-date=March 3, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414014113/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2003255.stm |archive-date=April 14, 2009 }}</ref>

===''TruANT'' (2003–2004)===

Alien Ant Farm soon returned to the studio to work on their next album, ''[[Truant (album)|Truant]]'', which was released in 2003 and produced by [[Stone Temple Pilots]]' [[Robert DeLeo|Robert]] and [[Dean DeLeo]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1470463/stone-temple-brothers-to-pilot-alien-ant-farm-album/|title=Stone Temple Brothers To Pilot Alien Ant Farm Album|last=Widerhorn|first=Jon|date=March 10, 2003|website=mtv.com|access-date=September 22, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923031735/http://www.mtv.com/news/1470463/stone-temple-brothers-to-pilot-alien-ant-farm-album/|archive-date=September 23, 2016}}</ref> The video for "[[These Days (Alien Ant Farm song)|These Days]]", the first single from the album, was filmed on top of a nearby building during the Red Carpet at the 2003 [[BET Awards]]. "Glow" was a mainstream radio success, achieving long lasting Top 20 success in New Zealand. Two months after this album was released, however, their record label closed its doors. This hindered the album's popularity over time, and the album was much less successful than their platinum-selling debut.

In October 2003, guitarist Corso split with the band citing "irreconcilable differences".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/alien-ant-farm-5-1379231 |title=ALIEN ANT FARM GUITARIST QUITS |date=November 3, 2003 |website=NME.com |access-date=March 3, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303225115/http://www.nme.com/news/music/alien-ant-farm-5-1379231 |archive-date=March 3, 2018 }}</ref> Victor Camacho (a long-time friend of the band and guitar player) immediately joined the band and completed the remainder of the Truant tour until the band returned home. Joe Hill was named the new guitarist in 2005 (formerly of Spiderworks).

In 2004, the band recorded the song "Dark in Here" for ''[[The Punisher (2005 video game)|The Punisher]]'' video game. The band was forced to wait for [[Geffen Records|Geffen]] to allow them to record another album (after [[Universal Music]] bought DreamWorks and assigned the band to its Geffen Records label).

===''3rd Draft'' and ''Up in the Attic'' (2005–2007)===

In 2005, the band recorded with producer Jim Wirt (who recorded their independent, debut release ''Greatest Hits'') and planned to release the album during that summer.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2005/08/19/features/index3.html |title=Alien Ant Farm on rebound trail |last=Genegabus |first=Jason |date=August 19, 2005 |access-date=March 3, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808203155/http://archives.starbulletin.com/2005/08/19/features/index3.html |archive-date=August 8, 2010 }}</ref> However, Geffen shelved the album and subsequently denied the band the rights to release it themselves.<ref name="3rd"/> The band hit the road and made bootleg copies of the album material available to all of their fans.<ref name="3rd"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.popentertainment.com/alienantfarm.htm |title=ALIEN ANT FARM BACK FROM THE ATTIC |last=Jacobs |first=Jay S. |date=July 21, 2006 |access-date=March 3, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303164647/http://www.popentertainment.com/alienantfarm.htm |archive-date=March 3, 2018 }}</ref> This unofficial release was dubbed ''3rd Draft'' by fans.

Four video games have featured the band's songs.

In late 2005, Geffen finally agreed to let the band release the album on another Universal label, Universal Music Enterprises (its catalog division).<ref name="3rd">{{Cite web |url=https://www.popmatters.com/alien-ant-farm-up-in-the-attic-2495696319.html |title=Alien Ant Farm: Up in the Attic |last=Schiller |first=Mike |date=September 26, 2006 |website=PopMatters.com |access-date=March 3, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303170236/https://www.popmatters.com/alien-ant-farm-up-in-the-attic-2495696319.html |archive-date=March 3, 2018 }}</ref> On May 30, 2006, the new album, ''[[Up in the Attic]]'', was released digitally on [[iTunes]] and sold at various retailers. The [[Best Buy]] Edition included a bonus track, "Repeat Defender". The first single was "Forgive and Forget", the one added track to ''3rd Draft''.

In April 2006, bassist Tye Zamora left the band and decided to go to college.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/news/443/Tye-Zamora-leaves-AAF/ |title=Tye Zamora leaves AAF |date=May 14, 2006 |website=SputnikMusic.com |access-date=March 3, 2018}}</ref> The short amount of live shows thereafter featured Alex Barreto on bass. On June 29, 2006, the band performed on [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]]'s ''[[Attack of the Show]]'', and on July 18, 2006, ''Up In The Attic'' was released worldwide, along with ''BUSted: The Definitive DVD''. Included on the DVD were music videos for "Forgive and Forget", "Around the Block", and "She's Only Evil". Notably, the three videos feature only Dryden Mitchell and Mike Cosgrove.

The band released "Around the Block", the second single from ''[[Up in the Attic]]'', on the [[iTunes Store]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/ca/music-video/around-the-block/189675119|title="Around the Block" on Apple Music|access-date=March 3, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304003804/https://itunes.apple.com/ca/music-video/around-the-block/189675119|archive-date=March 4, 2018}}</ref>

===Rejoining of Zamora and Corso (2007–2010)===

On February 11, 2008, the band posted a statement on their website stating Terry Corso and Tye Zamora had rejoined the band. It was also revealed that the band had "unofficially broken up" in 2007 due to the fact that 2006's ''[[Up in the Attic]]'' was their least successful album.

Around this time, vocalist Dryden Mitchell formed a new band, Send the Sages. Guitarist Terry Corso and drummer Michael Cosgrove worked on a side project titled Ghost In The Flesh, bassist Tye Zamora worked with the band eEnik. Alien Ant Farm toured sporadically, and released a new live album, Alien Ant Farm: Live In Germany.

In 2009, they played the [[Sonisphere Festival]] in Knebworth, UK on August 1.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4137545-sonisphere-2009-the-dis-review|title=Sonisphere 2009 - The DiS Review|last=Eddy|first=Kevin|date=August 6, 2009|website=drownedinsound.com|access-date=April 13, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429081853/http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4137545-sonisphere-2009-the-dis-review|archive-date=April 29, 2016}}</ref> They had also performed "[[Smooth Criminal]]" at the 2009 [[Vans]]' [[Warped Tour]] in memory of Michael Jackson, who had recently died.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ocregister.com/2009/06/27/punks-in-pomona-scenes-from-the-15th-annual-warped-tour/ |title=Punks in Pomona: Scenes from the 15th annual Warped Tour |last=Wener |first=Ben |date=June 27, 2009 |access-date=March 3, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303225244/https://www.ocregister.com/2009/06/27/punks-in-pomona-scenes-from-the-15th-annual-warped-tour/ |archive-date=March 3, 2018 }}</ref>
