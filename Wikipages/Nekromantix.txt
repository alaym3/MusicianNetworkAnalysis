The '''Nekromantix''' is a Danish-American [[psychobilly]] band founded in 1989 in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark. Their lyrics are generally structured around monster and [[horror fiction|horror]] themes. A central icon of the band's image is founder and frontman [[Kim Nekroman]]'s "coffinbass", a custom-built [[double bass]] with a body in the shape of a [[coffin]] and a [[headstock]] the shape of a [[cross]]. Nekroman has been the sole constant member of the band. The current lineup consists of guitarist Francisco Mesa and drummer Rene "Delamuerte" Garcia, known as a guitarist and singer of the Canadian band "The Brains".

The Nekromantix released five albums on various European record labels during their first decade, then crossed over to American audiences in the early 2000s by signing to [[Los Angeles]]-based [[Hellcat Records]], through which they have released three albums since 2002. Their eighth studio album, ''[[What Happens in Hell, Stays in Hell]]'', was released in August 2011.

==History==
===Formation===
The Nekromantix were formed in 1989 in [[Copenhagen]] by Kim Nekroman after he left the Danish Navy, in which he had been a [[submarine]] [[radio]] operator for eight years.<ref name="houston">{{cite news|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/2002-11-07/music/romancing-the-bones/|title=Romancing the Bones|website=Houstonpress.com|access-date=2009-05-22}}</ref> Deciding to launch a new career in music, he initially played [[Drum kit|drums]] in a [[rockabilly]] band prior to the foundation of Nekromantix.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Learning to play the double bass and to sing, Nekroman set about forming a horror-themed psychobilly band with himself as the frontman. Initially consisting of Nekroman, [[guitarist]] Paolo Molinari and drummer Jens Brygman, the band took the name Nekromantix.<ref name="starkult">{{cite web|title=Nekromantix |work=Starkult Promotion |url=http://www.starkult.de/bands/index.php3?band=nekromantix.txt |access-date=2007-07-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060809052444/http://www.starkult.de/bands/index.php3?band=nekromantix.txt |archive-date=August 9, 2006 }}</ref><ref name="thursby">{{cite web|last =Thursby|first =Eric|title =On the Lighter Side of Death: Interview With Nekromantix|work =EU Jacksonville|date =April 26, 2007|url =http://eujacksonville.com/pages/04-19-07/nekromantix.htm|archive-url =https://archive.today/20121208124208/http://eujacksonville.com/pages/04-19-07/nekromantix.htm|url-status =dead|archive-date =December 8, 2012|access-date =2007-08-10}}</ref>

A centerpiece of the band's image was Nekroman's self-constructed "coffinbass," an upright bass in the shape of a [[coffin]]. The first of these was constructed using an actual child-sized coffin, but over the years he has constructed new models in order to achieve better [[acoustics]] and collapsibility for easier transportation.<ref name="thursby"/> By the time of the band's first official recordings, Molinari and Brygman had been replaced respectively by Peter Sandorff and Sebastian Jensen, who used the [[pseudonym]] Peek.<ref name="FAQ">{{cite web|title =FAQ's and other useful info|work =Nekromantix official MySpace profile|url =http://www.myspace.com/nekromantix|access-date =2007-11-21}}</ref>

After six months of practice and two local performances in Copenhagen at the Stengade 30 club, the Nekromantix appeared at large psychobilly festival in [[Hamburg]], Germany.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Their performance earned them a recording contract with [[Tombstone Records]] for their first album ''[[Hellbound (Nekromantix album)|Hellbound]]''. The band began touring Europe and built a name for themselves in the European psychobilly movement, which at the time was largely dominated by [[United Kingdom|British]] acts.<ref name="starkult"/> In 1991 the band released their second album ''[[Curse of the Coffin]]'' through [[Nervous Records]] and supported it with a [[music video]] for the title track which received some play on the [[MTV]] program ''[[Alternative Nation Festival|Alternative Nation]]''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

===Lineup changes===
In 1992 both Peek and Sandorff left the band. They were replaced by guitarist Jan Daggry and drummer Tim Kristensen, who used the stage names Ian Dawn ("Dawn" being an English translation of the Danish name Daggry) and Grim Tim Handsome. This lineup recorded the album ''[[Brought Back to Life]]'', released in 1994, which earned a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for "Best Heavy Metal Album."<ref name="starkult"/>

Daggry then left the band and was replaced on tour first by Emil Oelund and then by Tormod Holm, until the band found new permanent guitarist Søren Munk Petersen.<ref name="FAQ"/> The Nekroman/Petersen/Kristensen lineup recorded 1996's ''[[Demons Are a Girl's Best Friend]]''. During this time the band toured most of Europe including [[Finland]], [[Germany]], [[United Kingdom|the UK]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Sweden]], and [[France]], and also toured [[Japan]]. They began to achieve cult status in the [[United States]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} where their albums were as yet only available as imports.

At a 1996 festival in [[Cologne, Germany]] Nekroman met fellow Copenhagen native [[Patricia Day]], with whom he launched a new band called [[HorrorPops]] with himself on guitar and Day on double bass and lead vocals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The two would later marry, and their activity with HorrorPops put the Nekromantix on hold for several years, during which time Kristensen and Petersen both left the band.

===International success===
In 1997 Peter Sandorff returned to Nekromantix, bringing along his brother, Kristian, to play drums. In 1999 the band played a tenth-anniversary performance at Stengade 30 in Copenhagen, where they had performed their first shows after forming the band.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} This performance was recorded by Danish National Radio for a series of live shows and released the following year as the live album ''[[Undead 'n' Live]]''. In 2000 the Nekromantix played their first performances in the United States, beginning with the first annual [[New York City]] "Psychobilly Rumble" and continuing with a nine-date tour of the west coast.<ref name="starkult"/>

In February 2001 Nekroman gave a demo of new songs to [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] singer/guitarist and [[Hellcat Records]] label owner [[Tim Armstrong]], a longtime fan of the band.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The Nekromantix soon signed to the [[Los Angeles]]-based Hellcat and released the 2002 album ''[[Return of the Loving Dead]]''. Recorded in Denmark, it was the band's first album to be widely distributed in the U.S. and helped make them part of an emerging psychobilly movement on the west coast centered around the Hellcat label and spearheaded by bands such as [[Tiger Army]]. The album was supported with a music video for the song "Gargoyles Over Copenhagen" and the band toured the United States several times.

===Move to the United States===
[[File:Nekromantix 2011-08-13 08.jpg|thumb|right|Guitarist Francisco Mesa (right) joined the band in 2009, while drummer Lux (center) joined in 2010.]]
Following the release of ''Return of the Loving Dead'' Nekroman relocated to Los Angeles, touring and recording two albums with the [[HorrorPops]]. The Sandorff brothers remained in Denmark, and recording of the Nekromantix' 2004 album ''[[Dead Girls Don't Cry]]'' was done almost entirely in Los Angeles, with only Peter Sandorff's backing vocals recorded in Copenhagen. In April 2005 the Sandorffs left the band leaving only Nekroman in band.<ref name="aversion">{{cite news|url=http://www.aversion.com/news/news_article.cfm?news_id=4107|title=Nekromantix Lose Guitarist, Drummer|website=Aversion.com|access-date=2009-05-22}}</ref> To replace them Nekroman recruited guitarist Troy Russel (Tröy Deströy) and drummer James Mesa (Wasted James) of the California-based psychobilly band the [[Rezurex]]. That year the band's third album ''[[Brought Back to Life]]'' was remastered and re-released by Hellcat under the title ''Brought Back To Life Again''.

===Recent activity===
In May 2006 Meza left the Nekromantix, later joining [[Tiger Army]]. He was replaced by Andrew Martinez (Andy DeMize) of The Rocketz. ''[[Life Is a Grave & I Dig It!]]'' was released in April 2007. In November 2007 the band announced Tröy Deströy's departure to focus on a solo career. Pete Belair of the [[Australia]]n band Firebird was announced as the band's new guitarist and performed with them during their 2008 tours, living in Australia complicated things and Francisco Mesa, formerly of [[Barcelona]]-based Nightbreed and Ultimo Asalto, joined as a permanent guitarist.<ref>{{cite web|title =Nekromantix ReVamped! & Still NekroTastic|work =Nekromantix official MySpace profile|url =http://www.myspace.com/nekromantix|access-date =2009-05-19}}</ref>

It was later announced in June 2014 that Adam Guerrero, formerly of Rezurex, would replace Lux as the new Nekromantix drummer. In October 2017, Guerrero departed from the band and Lux returned to fill in for a few shows. In April 2018 it was announced that Rene "Delamuerte" Garcia, from The Brains and BAT! would be the new Nekromantix drummer.
