Jonwayne's love of poetry led to his involvement in [[hip hop]] at 17 years old when a [[rap music|rap]] group from [[West Covina]] began bringing their equipment to a Young Artists Workshop that he attended. In early 2009, he began frequenting [[Low End Theory]], the [[Los Angeles]] club event where he would meet his friend and mentor, [[Dibiase]]. By 2010, he had booked his first gig at Low End Theory and became one of the youngest artists ever to perform there. He came to the attention of [[Stones Throw Records]] head [[Peanut Butter Wolf]] when the two were on the same bill at a benefit show at Low End Theory in 2010.<ref name=residentadvisor/>
