'''Omerta''' were an [[indie rock]] band from [[Manchester]], [[England]].  The band were an early forerunner of later UK Top 10 Albums act [[Slow Readers Club]]. In their own right, the band achieved considerable radio airplay and radio sessions.

== History ==
Omerta formed in 2003 when the four members decided to try to make a name for themselves by writing music that they enjoyed playing and listening to. James, Nick, and Neil were the first members of the band, having met one another while at school, they were already good friends and had previously been in a band called Foghead. They met Aaron in 2003 and Omerta was created.

Initially, the band were practicing all the time and writing new songs while learning where their musical influences would take them. By February 2004, they were playing venues across Manchester and the North West while still writing material.

By August 2004, Omerta had recorded their first [[Demo (music)|demo CD]], and while playing in [[York]], they distributed all the copies they had to the gathered crowd. Positive reviews soon followed and interest in the band became more evident with increased attendance at gigs and requests for music from record companies. Omerta continued to perform live, record and write more material for the next few months.

In February 2005, local indie label, Northern Ambition offered to release the band's first [[Single (music)|single]].  April 2005 saw the release of debut [[Double A-side]] single Everyone is Frozen / Learn to Love the System on a limited 7" run and stockists were forced to restrict purchase to only one copy per customer in the interests of public order.  Stocks in [[Manchester]] and [[London]] sold out in three days. Fans who were too late bid on [[eBay]] for up to fifteen times the disc's original value.

The Everyone is Frozen single was playlisted on [[XFM]], chosen as record of the week by [[Claire Sturgess]] and recommended by [[Steve Lamacq]] on his [[BBC 6 Music]] show.<ref>{{cite web

In early October 2005 the band released their second single "One Chance" on a limited edition of 400 T inch vinyl singles and 400 CDs. Much like the first single, "One Chance" received considerable radio airplay and press, and the entire pressing sold out in only one day. In addition the single also went in at Position 36 in the BBC Indie/Rock Official Chart Listing.

Omerta were in XFM's top 5 live sessions of 2005 (which included many signed artists) and they were Piccadilly Records' number 1 Indie Single of 2005 as well as making their list of 2005's best sellers).<ref>{{cite web

In 2006 the band released a single "One More Minute" on Northern Ambition.  However, by summer 2007 the band had split, and in 2008 Starkie, Turvin and Ryan formed a new band under the name The [[Slow Readers Club]].
