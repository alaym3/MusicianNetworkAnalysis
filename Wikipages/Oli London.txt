==Career==
After their appearances on the documentary series ''Hooked On The Look'', many [[YouTubers]] began reacting and commentating to the episode.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.koreaboo.com/stories/popular-youtuber-found-bts-superfan-oli-londons-tiktok-flabbergasted-content/|website=Koreaboo|title=Popular YouTuber Found BTS Superfan Oli London's TikTok, Flabbergasted by the Content|date=26 December 2019}}</ref> It quickly went [[Viral video|viral]], and their channel grew.

London's first single, "Perfection", was released in 3 February 2019, and their debut album "Fallen Angel" is scheduled for release on 1 December 2021.<ref name="interview1" />

London has appeared on multiple TV shows, and they have a film “Gangnam Beauty” about identity and plastic surgery, which has been premiered in multiple film events across Europe.

==Identity==
London came out as [[Non-binary gender|non-binary]] and "[[Transracial (identity)|transracial]]" on Twitter in 2021 and stated that they use the pronouns "they/them/Korean/Jimin" (or, alternatively, "kor/ean"),<ref name="Neumann">{{cite news |last1=Neumann |first1=Laiken |title=White influencer under fire for appropriating Korean flag after getting plastic surgeries to 'look Korean'|url=https://www.dailydot.com/irl/white-influencer-nonbinary-korean/ |work=The Daily Dot |date=21 June 2021 |quote=Many social media users also criticized London's use of 'Kor/ean' and 'Korean/Jimin' as pronouns and said that using them to express a transracial identity is offensive. '[[Neopronouns]]' third-person pronouns that are not officially recognized in a particular language. 'Ze' and 'zir,' for example, indicate gender neutrality.}}</ref> and says they are in the process of [[Ethnic plastic surgery|"transitioning" from white to Asian]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Oli London: British influencer defends 'identifying as Korean' after surgery to look like BTS star |url=https://news.sky.com/story/oli-london-british-influencer-defends-identifying-as-korean-after-surgery-to-look-like-bts-star-12344765 |access-date=30 June 2021 |work=Sky News |date=29 June 2021}}</ref>

Their transition is controversial, with social media users arguing London’s statements are harmful to the transgender community.<ref name="Neumann"/> Sandra Song in ''[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]'' magazine said: "As someone who actually has Korean DNA though, I can say that some white fetishist — as proven by those 15 surgeries to look like Jimin — suddenly deeming themself 'Korean' is incredibly offensive, especially since it effectively trivializes our identities because they're suddenly 'trendy'."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Song |first1=Sandra |title=Oli London Says They're 'Nonbinary Korean'|url=https://www.papermag.com/oli-london-nonbinary-korean-2653496117.html |work=Paper |date=23 June 2021}}</ref>

In May 2021, London's [[Instagram]] was erroneously labelled as "memorialised", usually meaning that the owner of the account was dead, which drew media attention. This occurred after there were rumours that London [[Suicide|took their own life]], fuelled by a [[fake news]] article.<ref name="Haasch">{{cite news |last1=Haasch |first1=Palmer |title=A British influencer got plastic surgery to look like a BTS member.
