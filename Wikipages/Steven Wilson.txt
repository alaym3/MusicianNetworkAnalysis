==Biography==
===Early years===
Born in [[Kingston upon Thames]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://no-man.co.uk/biography-1980s.html|title=no-man|access-date=2010-04-05}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> London, Wilson was raised from age six in [[Hemel Hempstead|Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire]], where he discovered his interest in music around the age of eight. According to Wilson, his life was changed one Christmas when his parents bought presents for each other in the form of [[Gramophone record|LPs]]. His father and mother received [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' and [[Donna Summer]]'s ''[[Love to Love You Baby (album)|Love to Love You Baby]]'', respectively. It was Wilson's affinity for these albums that helped craft his guitar and songwriting abilities.<ref>{{cite web|first=Steven |last=Rosen |url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/interviews/steven_wilson_porcupine_tree_was_gonna_be_a_one-off_thing.html |title=Steven Wilson: 'Porcupine Tree Was Gonna Be A One-Off Thing'  |website=Ultimate Guitar Archive |date=2011-12-14 |access-date=2016-03-22|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108002946/https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/steven_wilson_porcupine_tree_was_gonna_be_a_one-off_thing.html|archive-date=2012-01-08}}</ref>

Both LPs influenced his future song writing. He says "in retrospect I can see how they are almost entirely responsible for the direction that my music has taken ever since". His interest in Pink Floyd led him towards [[experimental music|experimental]]/[[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] [[Concept album|conceptual]] progressive rock (as exemplified by [[Porcupine Tree]] and [[Blackfield]]), and Donna Summer's [[hypnosis|trance]]-inflected [[groove (popular music)|grooves]] inspired the initial musical approach of [[No-Man]] (Wilson's long-running collaboration with fellow musician and vocalist [[Tim Bowness]]), although the band would later develop a more meditative and experimental [[Talk Talk]]-esque approach.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

As a child, Wilson was forced to learn the guitar, but he did not enjoy it; his parents eventually stopped paying for lessons. However, when he was eleven, he found a nylon string [[classical guitar]] from his attic and started to experiment with it; in his own words, "scraping microphones across the strings, feeding the resulting sound into overloaded reel to reel tape recorders and producing a primitive form of multi-track recording by bouncing between two cassette machines". A year later, his father, who was an [[electronic engineer]], built him his first multi-track tape machine and a [[vocoder]] so he could begin experimenting with the possibilities of studio recording.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freewilliamsburg.com/september_2002/porcupine.html|title=Porcupine Tree|publisher=Free Williamsburg|access-date=2008-04-13|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121209213001/http://www.freewilliamsburg.com/september_2002/porcupine.html|archive-date=9 December 2012}}</ref>

===Early bands===
[[File:Steven Wilson Strawberry Fayre Cambridge 1997.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Wilson in 1997]]
Wilson says his taste in music diverged from his peers in the 1980s:<blockquote>I grew up in the 80s, and it was a pretty bad decade for music. There were some interesting things developing, but everyone I knew wanted to be in [[Level 42]], [[Simple Minds]] or [[U2]]. I wasn't interested in any of that, so I found solace in the 60s and 70s music that my parents were listening to. And I began to discover this wonderful era, what you'd call the great album era, from 1967 to 1977, from ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|Sgt Pepper]]'' through to [[punk rock|punk]].<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-50-greatest-guitarists-of-all-time | title= The 50 Best Guitarists of All Time | work=Louder | date=29 September 2018 | access-date=25 September 2019}}</ref> </blockquote>

One of Wilson's earliest musical projects was the psychedelic duo Altamont (featuring a 15-year-old Wilson working with synth/electronics player Simon Vockings). Their one and only cassette album, ''Prayer for the Soul'', featured lyrics by English psychedelic scenester Alan Duffy, whose work Wilson would later use on first two Porcupine Tree albums. Around the same time that Wilson was part of Altamont, he was also in a progressive rock band called Karma, which played live around Hertfordshire and recorded two cassette albums, ''The Joke's on You'' (1983) and ''The Last Man To Laugh'' (1985). These contained early versions of "Small Fish", "Nine Cats" and "The Joke's on You", which were subsequently resurrected as Porcupine Tree songs.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

Wilson went on to join the New Wave/AOR band Pride of Passion as keyboard player, replacing former [[Marillion]] keyboard player Brian Jelliman (another former Marillion member, Diz Minnitt, also played in the band). Pride of Passion would later change their name to Blazing Apostles and alter their lineup and approach, finally coming to an end in 1987.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themarqueeclub.net/interview-diz-minnitt-of-marillion|title=Interview - Diz Minnitt of Marillion|website=[[Marquee Club|TheMarqueeClub.net]]|date=August 2006 |access-date=2010-09-15| first=Koldo|last=Barroso |url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061224175221/http://www.themarqueeclub.net/interview-diz-minnitt-of-marillion| archive-date=2006-12-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.graham-collins.com/drummer/index.php/bio/about|title=About HISTORY|access-date=2010-09-15|first=Graham|last=Collins|date=2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909181857/http://www.graham-collins.com/drummer/index.php/bio/about|archive-date=9 September 2010}}</ref>

===Breakthrough work===
{{section citations needed|date=February 2021}}

Up to this point Wilson's diverse musical experiments had contained [[avant-garde]] and [[industrial music|industrial]] recordings, psychedelia and progressive rock. He was, however, also becoming more interested in songwriting and pop music, something that would manifest itself in his next developments.

In 1986, Wilson launched the two projects that would make his name. The first of these was initially called "No Man Is An Island (Except The Isle of Man)", although it would later be renamed "[[No-Man]]." This began life as a solo Wilson instrumental project blending progressive rock with synth pop, subsequently moving towards art-pop when singer/lyricist [[Tim Bowness]] joined the project the following year. The second project was "[[Porcupine Tree]]", which was originally intended to be a full-on pastiche of psychedelic rock (inspired by the similar [[Dukes of Stratosphear]] project by [[XTC]]) carried out for the mutual entertainment of Wilson and his childhood friend Malcolm Stocks.

Over the next three years, the projects would evolve in parallel. Of his two efforts, No Man Is An Island (Except The Isle of Man) was the first to release a commercial single (1989's "The Girl From Missouri", on Plastic Head Records), while Porcupine Tree built an increasing underground reputation via the release of a series of cassette-only releases via The Freak Emporium (the mail-order wing of British psychedelic label [[Delerium Records]]).

By 1990, No Man Is An Island (Except The Isle of Man) had fully evolved into No-Man and was a voice/violin/multi-instrument trio which had incorporated dance beats into its art-pop sound. The second No-Man single – a crooned cover of the [[Donovan]] song "Colours" arranged in a dub-loop style anticipating [[trip hop]] - won the Single of the Week award in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' and gained the band a recording contract with the high-profile independent label [[One Little Indian]] (at the time, famous for [[The Shamen]] and [[Björk]]). Their debut One Little Indian single, "Days in the Trees", won the same Single of the Week award the following year. The single also briefly charted and, although sales were not outstanding, Wilson had now gained credibility in the record industry (as well as enough finance to fit out his home studio with the equipment he would need to advance his music).

By this time, Wilson had also released the official Porcupine Tree debut album, ''[[On the Sunday of Life]]...''  (which compiled the best material from the underground tapes). No-Man's debut full-length release – a compilation of EP tracks called ''Lovesighs – An Entertainment'' – followed in 1992, as did Porcupine Tree's infamous LSD-themed maxi-single "[[Voyage 34]]" which made the ''[[NME]]'' [[indie (music)|indie]] [[music chart|chart]] for six weeks.<ref name="Porcupine Tree Biography">{{cite web|url = http://www.porcupinetree.com/background.cfm|title = Porcupine Tree Biography|access-date = 2007-05-15|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080410092648/http://www.porcupinetree.com/background.cfm|archive-date = 10 April 2008}}</ref> No-Man also toured England with a six-piece band including three ex-members of the art-pop band [[Japan (band)|Japan]] – [[Mick Karn]], [[Steve Jansen]] and (most significantly) keyboardist [[Richard Barbieri]]. 1993 saw Wilson consolidating his initial success with albums from both Porcupine Tree (''[[Up the Downstair]]'') and No-Man (''Loveblows And Lovecries – A Confession'').

Porcupine Tree, meanwhile, toured frequently and passed through various overt phases of different musical stylings (including psychedelia, progressive rock, modern guitar rock and heavy metal) while retaining the core of Wilson's sonic imagination and songwriting. By the mid-2000s Porcupine Tree had become a well known rock band with albums on major labels such as Atlantic and Roadrunner. Also by this time, Wilson had become in-demand as a producer and was being cited as an influence by various up-and-coming musicians.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===Diversification and collaborations===
[[File:Steven Wilson acoustic.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Wilson in 1999]]
During the late 1990s, Wilson's love of experimental, drone and ambient music led to a series of new projects, notably [[Bass Communion]] and [[Incredible Expanding Mindfuck]] (also known as IEM). He also began to release a series of CD singles under his own name.

Having established himself as a producer, Wilson was invited to produce other artists, notably the Norwegian artist [[Anja Garbarek]] and Swedish progressive-metal band [[Opeth]]. Though he claims to enjoy production more than anything else, with the demands of his own projects, he has mostly restricted himself to mixing for other artists in the last few years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swhq.co.uk/guest.cfm|title=Guest Appearances - Steven Wilson Headquarters|access-date=2008-04-06|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-08-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191133/http://www.swhq.co.uk/guest.cfm}}</ref>

Wilson has written reviews for the Mexican edition of the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. They are all translated into Spanish.

In addition to this, he has collaborated on many projects with Belgian experimental musician Dirk Serries of [[Vidna Obmana]] and [[Fear Falls Burning]], most notably on their collaboration project [[Continuum (music project)|Continuum]] which has so far produced two albums. Wilson is also featured on a Fovea Hex EP ''Allure'' (Part{{nbsp}}3 of the "Neither Speak Nor Remain Silent" trilogy of EP's) on bass guitar.

On 5 March 2020, Wilson began a teaser campaign across his online channels, centering on modern themes of [[consumerism]], [[Branding (promotional)|product branding]] and manipulative social media.<ref>{{Cite web|last=March 2020|first=Scott Munro05|title=Steven Wilson teases new project The Future Bites|url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/steven-wilson-teases-new-project-the-future-bites|access-date=2020-03-10|website=Prog Magazine|language=en}}</ref> A few days later, artwork for "Personal Shopper" was unveiled with a release date of 12 March 2020 at 9am GMT.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Steven Wilson on Instagram: "STEVEN WILSON x @THEFUTUREBITES // PRODUCT DROP "PERSONAL SHOPPER" // 12-03-20 9AM GMT #stevenwilson #thefuturebites #productdrop…"|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B9hsGMpjynN/|access-date=2020-03-10|website=Instagram|language=en}}</ref> On 12 March 2020, Wilson announced that his sixth solo album ''The Future Bites'' would be released on 12 June 2020.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Steven Wilson Announces New Album 'The Future Bites'|url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/steven-wilsons-new-album-the-future-bites-delayed-until-2021|access-date=2020-03-18|website=Clash Magazine|language=en}}</ref> The first single to be taken from the album, "Personal Shopper" (featuring a spoken word appearance by [[Elton John]]), was released the same day.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Hartmann|first=Graham|title=Steven Wilson Releases Futuristic Song 'Personal Shopper,' Announces New Album|url=https://loudwire.com/steven-wilson-personal-shopper-new-album/|access-date=2020-03-18|website=Loudwire|language=en}}</ref>

On 22 April 2020, Wilson announced that the release date of ''The Future Bites'' would be pushed back to 29 January 2021, due to logistical/creative challenges facing the music industry amid the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Peacock|first=Tim|date=2020-04-22|title=Steven Wilson New Album The Future Bites Delayed Until January 2021|url=https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/steven-wilson-future-bites-delayed/|access-date=2020-04-22|website=uDiscover Music|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== 2021–present: 7th & 8th studio albums, autobiography ===
On 22 March 2021, Wilson announced that due to uncertainty surrounding live performances amidst the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], The Future Bites Tour (scheduled to begin in September 2021) would be cancelled.<ref>{{Cite web|last=March 2021|first=Jerry Ewing22|title=Steven Wilson cancels rescheduled The Future Bites tour|url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/steven-wilson-cancels-rescheduled-the-future-bites-tour|access-date=2021-03-22|website=Prog Magazine|language=en}}</ref> Wilson stated that he will now concentrate on upcoming music projects, working on two albums that are planned for release in 2022 and 2023 respectively. Wilson also confirmed that he is finishing an autobiography due to be published by [[Little, Brown and Company]] in late 2021.

==Musical projects==
===Porcupine Tree===
{{Main|Porcupine Tree}}
Porcupine Tree started out as a duo of Wilson and his school friend Malcolm Stocks (with Wilson providing the majority of the instrumentation and Stocks contributing mostly ideas, additional vocals and experimental guitar sounds). Wilson began experimenting by recording music in his home until he had the hunch it could become someway marketable. The material was subsequently compiled into three demo tapes (''[[Tarquin's Seaweed Farm]]'', ''[[Love, Death & Mussolini]]'' and ''[[The Nostalgia Factory]]''). For the first tape, he even wrote an inlay introduction to an obscure (imaginary) band called "The Porcupine Tree", suggesting the band met in the early '70s at a rock festival, and they had been in and out of prison many times. The booklet also contained information about band's obscure members like Sir Tarquin Underspoon and Timothy Tadpole-Jones, and crew members like Linton Samuel Dawson (if put into initials forming [[LSD]]). Wilson: "It was a bit of fun. But of course like anything that starts as a joke, people started to take it all seriously!".<ref name="DPRP">{{cite web |url=http://www.dprp.net/proghistory/index.php?i=1999_01 |title =DPRP - Counting Out Time |website=Dutch Progressive Rock |access-date=1 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090444/http://www.dprp.net/proghistory/index.php?i=1999_01 |archive-date=2007-09-29}}</ref> When Wilson signed to [[Delerium Records|Delerium]] label, he selected what he considered the best tracks from these early tapes. All those songs were mastered and made up Porcupine Tree's first official studio album, ''[[On the Sunday of Life]]...''.

Quickly after, Wilson would release the [[Single (music)|single]] "[[Voyage 34]]", a thirty-minute long piece that could be described as a mixture of [[ambient (music)|ambient]], [[trance (music)|trance]] and [[psychedelia]]. This was done partly as an attempt to produce the longest single yet released, which it was until it was later exceeded by The Orb's "Blue Room." With non-existent radio play "Voyage 34" still managed to enter the ''[[NME]]'' [[indie (music)|indie]] [[music chart|chart]] for six weeks and became an underground [[Relaxation technique|chill-out]] classic.<ref name="Porcupine Tree Biography"/>

The second full-length album, ''[[Up the Downstair]]'' (though Wilson considers it the first 'proper' PT album since it was made as such and not simply compiled), was released in 1993 and had a very good reception, praised by ''[[Melody Maker]]'' as "a psychedelic masterpiece... one of the albums of the year".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snappermusic.com/ms/porcupinetree/ |title=Porcupine Tree's Digital Releases |publisher=[[Snapper Music]] |access-date=2008-02-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511152024/http://www.snappermusic.com/ms/porcupinetree/ |archive-date=11 May 2008 }}</ref> This was the first album to include ex-[[Japan (band)|Japan]] member, keyboardist [[Richard Barbieri]] and [[Australian]]-born [[bassist]] [[Colin Edwin]]. About the end of the year, Porcupine Tree became a full band for the first time with the inclusion of [[Chris Maitland]] on [[Drum kit|drums]].

Wilson continued exploring the ambient and trance grounds and issued ''[[The Sky Moves Sideways]]''. It also entered the ''NME'', ''Melody Maker'', and ''[[Music Week]]'' charts<ref name="Porcupine Tree Biography"/> and many fans started hailing them as the [[Pink Floyd]] of the nineties, something Wilson would reject: "I can't help that. It's true that during the period of 'The Sky Moves Sideways', I had done a little too much of it in the sense of satisfying, in a way, the fans of Pink Floyd who were listening to us because that group doesn't make albums anymore. Moreover, I regret it."<ref name="DPRP"/>

The band's fourth work, ''[[Signify]]'', included the first full-band compositions and performance, which resulted in less use of drum machines and a more full-band sound. It can be considered a departure from its predecessors for a more song-oriented style.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jerry Kranitz |author2=Keith Henderson |url=http://www.aural-innovations.com/issues/issue7/ptree03.html |title=Porcupine Tree (Review/Interview) |website=Aural Innovations |date=July 1999 |access-date=3 April 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101095651/http://www.aural-innovations.com/issues/issue7/ptree03.html |archive-date=2008-01-01}}</ref> After the release of the live album ''[[Coma Divine - Recorded Live in Rome|Coma Divine]]'' concluded their deal with Delerium in 1997, the band moved to [[Snapper Music|Snapper]] and issued two poppier albums, ''[[Stupid Dream]]'' in 1999 and ''[[Lightbulb Sun]]'' in 2000.

Two years would pass until their seventh studio album, and in the meantime the band switched labels again, this time signing to the major label [[Lava Records|Lava]]. Drummer [[Chris Maitland]] was also replaced by [[Gavin Harrison]]. ''[[In Absentia]]'' was released in 2002, featuring a heavier sound than all the group's previous works. It charted in many European countries and remains one of the top-selling Porcupine Tree albums to date. The 2004 special edition was also their first record to be released in [[5.1 Surround Sound]], winning the "Best Made-For-Surround Title" award from the Surround Music Awards 2004 shortly afterwards.

In 2005, Porcupine Tree released ''[[Deadwing]]'', a record inspired by a film script written by Steven Wilson and his friend Mike Bennion. This became the first Porcupine Tree album to chart on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], entering at #132. The album won ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' magazine's "album of the year" award<ref name="Steven Wilson - The Complete Discography (6th Edition)">{{cite web|url=http://www.voyage-pt.de/swdisco.pdf|title=Steven Wilson -The Complete Discography (6th Edition), p. 111|access-date=1 November 2005|first=Uwe|last=Häberle|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621210549/http://www.voyage-pt.de/swdisco.pdf|archive-date=21 June 2007}}</ref> and its surround version received the "Best Made-For-Surround Title" once again.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.surroundexpo.com/awards.shtml | title = Surround Expo 2005 | date = 2005-12-15 | access-date= 2005-12-15 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20051214183245/http://www.surroundexpo.com/awards.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 14 December 2005}}</ref>
[[File:Porcupine Tree @ Poznan, Poland 2007 02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Wilson with Porcupine Tree at Arena, [[Poznań]], Poland, November 2007]]

Wilson started writing Porcupine Tree's next album in early 2006 in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]], alongside work on the second album for his side-project [[Blackfield]]. Writing sessions finished in London, UK, in June 2006. In August of the same year the band released their first live [[DVD]], titled ''[[Arriving Somewhere...]]'', and started a tour between September and November to promote it; the first half of each show was made up of all-new material. When the tour concluded the band went into the studio and finished recording and mastering the album. In early January 2007, the band revealed the album title was going to be ''[[Fear of a Blank Planet]]'' (a deliberate reference to Public Enemy's ''[[Fear of a Black Planet]]'') and the concept was influenced by the [[Bret Easton Ellis]] novel [[Lunar Park]]. The album hit the shops on 16 April 2007 in Europe and 24 April in USA. The lyrics revolve around common 21st Century issues such as technology alienation, teen violence, prescription drugs, [[attention deficit disorder]] and [[bipolar disorder]].

''Fear of a Blank Planet'' resulted in the most successful album to date in terms of market and sales, and also received the most favourable reviews of the band's whole career. It entered the Billboard 200 at #59, and charted in almost all European countries, peaking at #31 in the UK. It was nominated for a US [[Grammy]], and won several polls as the best album of the year (e.g. ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' magazine, Aardshock, The Netherlands). In July 2007 the ''Nil Recurring'' EP was released, containing material that had been left off the album.

At a European show in August 2008, Wilson said Porcupine Tree was beginning work on material for their next album with an eye toward a release in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theseaweedfarm.com/2008/10/new-porcupine-tree-album-in-2009.html |title=New Porcupine Tree Album in 2009 |date=20 October 2008 |access-date=2008-11-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205163630/http://www.theseaweedfarm.com/2008/10/new-porcupine-tree-album-in-2009.html |archive-date=5 December 2008}}</ref> This album was later revealed to be titled ''The Incident''. ''The Incident'' is a double CD set containing "The Incident", a 55-minute "song cycle", on the first disc and four shorter songs on the second. It has received significant attention and media coverage and the band achieved their highest chart positions to date, reaching 5{{nbsp}}in The Netherlands, 9{{nbsp}}in Germany, 23 in the UK and 25 on the Billboard 200 in the USA. The subsequent tour of the US and Europe highlighted a large increase in the band's following, with many shows sold out.  The single from ''The Incident'', "Time Flies" was available as a free download from iTunes for one week in October 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://porcupinetree.com/news.cfm |title=Porcupine Tree - Official Website |publisher=porcupinetree.com |date=2009-10-22 |access-date=2010-05-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419042624/http://www.porcupinetree.com/news.cfm |archive-date=19 April 2010}}</ref>
In 2010 after this tour, the band became inactive as Wilson committed himself to his solo work and other members began working on their own separate projects. The band made a surprise reformation in 2021 after a 12 year hiatus. The band is now made up of a trio line-up of Wilson, Barbieri and Harrison. The band’s former bassist, Colin Edwin, did not return. The reformation was formally revealed on 1 November 2021, with the simultaneous release of the "Harridan" single and the announcement of a new studio album, [[Closure/Continuation]], to be released on 24 June 2022. <ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-11-01|title=Porcupine Tree return with new single 'Harridan' and 'CLOSURE/CONTINUATION' album announcement|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/porcupine-tree-return-with-new-single-harridan-and-closure-continuation-album-announcement-3084235|access-date=2021-11-04|website=NME|language=en-GB}}</ref>

===No-Man===
{{Main|No-Man}}
No-Man is Wilson's long-term collaboration with singer and songwriter [[Tim Bowness]]. Influenced by everything from ambient music to hip-hop, their early singles and albums were a mixture of dance beats and lush orchestrations. However, after a few years the duo started to create more textural and experimental music. Beginning with ''[[Flowermouth]]'' in 1994, they have worked with a very wide palette of sounds, and many guest musicians, blending balladry with both acoustic and electronic sounds. No-Man was the first Wilson project to achieve any degree of success, signing with UK independent label [[One Little Indian]] (the label of [[Björk]], [[The Shamen]] and [[Skunk Anansie]] among others).
On 22 November 2019, the band released their seventh album ''[[Love You to Bits]]'', their first original recording in 11 years.

===I.E.M.===
{{Main|Incredible Expanding Mindfuck}}
In 1996 came the first in a series of albums by I.E.M. (The Incredible Expanding Mindfuck, a name which had also been considered for Porcupine Tree in its infancy), dedicated to exploring Wilson's love of [[krautrock]] and experimental rock music. Initially Wilson had planned for the project to be anonymous, but then label Delerium Records published a song on their Pick N Mix compilation with the composition credited to "Steven Wilson" and so attempts to pass off the project in this way were abandoned.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.porcupinetree.com/background.interviews.cfm?press=1471#i| title =  Porcupine Tree Interviews: Record Collector November 1996 Issue 207  | access-date= 2008-03-25|url-status=dead|archive-date=2008-05-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510061050/http://www.porcupinetree.com/background.interviews.cfm?press=1471}}</ref> The project released two more albums ''[[Arcadia Son]]'', and ''IEM Have Come For Your Children'', in 2001. A box set of four CDs, consisting of everything Wilson recorded under the name - billed as "an homage and a final farewell to I.E.M." - was released in June 2010.

===Bass Communion===

In 1998 Wilson launched Bass Communion, a project dedicated to recordings in an industrial, [[ambient music|ambient]], [[drone music|drone]], and/or electronic vein.

===Blackfield===
{{Main|Blackfield}}
In 2001 Wilson met and began to collaborate with [[Israelis|Israeli]] [[rock music|rock]] musician [[Aviv Geffen]], with whom he created the band [[Blackfield]]. Since then the duo have released three acclaimed albums of what they refer to as "melodic and melancholic rock." The albums spawned several singles, notably "Blackfield," "Pain" and "Once." A live DVD from a show in New York was released in 2007.  A third album titled "[[Welcome to my DNA]]" came in March 2011. Later that year Wilson decided to take a secondary role in the band, feeling that with so much of his time and attention devoted to his solo career, there was not enough left for him to properly fill the role of co-leader of Blackfield as well. He still contributed to the band's [[Blackfield IV|fourth album]] in 2013 as singer and producer. Wilson left the band after a short European tour in February 2014<ref>{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=Steven |url=http://stevenwilsonhq.com/sw/blackfield-tour-reminder/ |title=Blackfield European tour remainder |publisher=StevenWilsonHQ |access-date=2014-01-29 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203031231/http://stevenwilsonhq.com/sw/blackfield-tour-reminder/ |archive-date=3 February 2014}}</ref> and a final date in New York City on 1{{nbsp}}May 2014,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/blackfield/2014/best-buy-theater-new-york-ny-13c31d09.html |title=Blackfield Concert Setlist at Best Buy Theater, New York on May 1, 2014 |publisher=Setlist.fm |access-date=2015-04-15 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924125911/http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/blackfield/2014/best-buy-theater-new-york-ny-13c31d09.html |archive-date=24 September 2015}}</ref> due to his increasingly tight schedule with his solo career and upcoming projects.

===Storm Corrosion===

In March 2010 Wilson and [[Mikael Åkerfeldt]], the front man of [[Opeth]], decided to work on a new project as a collaboration under the name of ''Storm Corrosion''. The self-titled album was released in May 2012 on ''[[Roadrunner Records]]''. It has been described as being "the final part in the odd trilogy of records completed by (Opeth's) ''[[Heritage (Opeth album)|Heritage]]'' and Steven Wilson's second solo album ''[[Grace for Drowning]]''."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theprp.com/2011/09/26/news/opethporcupine-tree-project-to-release-debut-early-next-year-opeth-ny-soundcheck-footage-available/ |title=Opeth/Porcupine Tree Project To Release Debut Early Next Year, Opeth NY Soundcheck Footage Available &#124; Theprp.com – Metal, Hardcore And Rock News, Reviews And More |publisher=Theprp.com |date=2011-09-26 |access-date=2013-02-26 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412034542/http://www.theprp.com/2011/09/26/news/opethporcupine-tree-project-to-release-debut-early-next-year-opeth-ny-soundcheck-footage-available/ |archive-date=12 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=74431 |title=Steven Wilson Talks Mikael Akerfeldt Collaboration - in Metal News |publisher=Metal Underground.com |date=2011-11-28 |access-date=2013-02-26 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412043427/http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=74431 |archive-date=12 April 2013}}</ref> Åkerfeldt and Wilson did no shows in support of the album,<ref name="innerviews1">{{ cite web | last = Prasad | first = Anil | author-link = Anil Prasad | url = http://www.innerviews.org/inner/wilson.html | title = Steven Wilson - Art as a mirror | website = Innerviews | date = 2012 | access-date = 2012-05-06 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120503132912/http://www.innerviews.org/inner/wilson.html | archive-date = 3 May 2012 }}</ref> and while the two have expressed interest in working together again, they are not currently writing another album for ''Storm Corrosion''.<ref name=RM>{{cite web|last=Phil|first=Philippe|title=Storm Corrosion: Soul Mates|url=http://www.radiometal.com/en/article/storm-corrosion-soul-mates,71733|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130201054402/http://www.radiometal.com/en/article/storm-corrosion-soul-mates,71733|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 February 2013|publisher=Radio Metal|access-date=4 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=album>{{cite web|title=Opeth's Mikael Akerfeldt Talks Pale Communion Album, Possibility of a Second Storm Corrosion Album|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/opeths-mikael-akerfeldt-talks-pale-communion-album-possibility-of-second-storm-corrosion-cd-audio/|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=13 June 2014|access-date=24 June 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620043004/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/opeths-mikael-akerfeldt-talks-pale-communion-album-possibility-of-second-storm-corrosion-cd-audio/|archive-date=20 June 2014}}</ref>

For live shows, Wilson plays barefoot. His habit goes back to his early childhood, where he has said, "I always had a problem wearing shoes and I've always gone around with bare feet".<ref name = Rockeyez>{{cite web | url = http://www.rockeyez.com/interviews/int-porcupine-tree.html | title = Interview: Steven Wilson (Porcupine Tree) | website = rockeyez.com | date = 2005-05-12 | access-date = 2008-03-10 | first1 = Carlos | last1= Rodrigues | first2 = David | last2 = Felix | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20051025045819/http://www.rockeyez.com/interviews/int-porcupine-tree.html | archive-date = 25 October 2005 }}</ref> He has said that another factor in performing barefoot is the advantage it gives in operating his diverse guitar pedals.<ref name="swedish">{{cite web | date=23 March 2001 |url = http://www.dprp.net/specials/porcupinetree/index.html | title = Specials - Steve Wilson Interview | publisher = Dutch Progressive Rock Page | access-date = 2008-03-10 | first=Joakim|last=Jahlmar | location = Borås, Sweden | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040504090452/http://www.dprp.net/specials/porcupinetree/index.html | archive-date = 4 May 2004 }}</ref> He has injured his feet as a result: in one of his early shows, he ended up with a syringe inserted in his foot and had to get a [[tetanus vaccine]].
