The origins of New Found Glory date back to 1997 when [[Jordan Pundik]] (vocals) and [[Ian Grushka]] (bass) played together in the band "Inner City Kids" and later "Flip 60".  After disbanding "Flip 60", they recruited [[Steve Klein (musician)|Stephen Klein]] (guitar), who Pundik met at [[Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School]] and had previously played with him in the band "Fallview". The three began to jam together. Practicing in Grushka's garage, they later invited Joe "Taco Joe" Marino to play drums. Shortly thereafter, Chad Gilbert (lead guitar), former vocalist of [[Shai Hulud (band)|Shai Hulud]], joined to complete the quintet.

Pundik later stated the band name was created while he and Klein were working at [[Red Lobster (restaurant)|Red Lobster]] together; "We came up with A New Found Glory, we wrote it on a napkin. I think we pulled some of it from "[[A Newfound Interest in Massachusetts]]" by the [[Get Up Kids]]".<ref name="Oral2">{{Citation | title = 1996-1997: The Oral History of New Found Glory | url = http://i49.tinypic.com/2vlnqs4.jpg | newspaper = [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] | date = March 2010|author=Manley, Brendan|issue=260|page=63|access-date=January 31, 2010|issn = 1065-1667}}</ref> 
The band recorded their debut EP, ''[[It's All About the Girls]]'' (1997) in a friend's apartment, and the EP was distributed by local [[independent label]] [[Fiddler Records]].  Soon after, Marino was replaced by current drummer Cyrus Bolooki after two rehearsal sessions.<ref name="Oral2"/> The band went on to tour up and down the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and quickly sold out the entire pressing of the EP.<ref name="AllMusic">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p384007/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=New Found Glory Biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|author=Ankeny, Jason|access-date=July 8, 2009}}</ref> The band's [[underground music|underground]] success soon caught the attention of [[Eulogy Recordings]] and the quintet subsequently signed shortly afterwards in order to increase distribution of their music.<ref name="Oral2"/>

Following the success of their EP, the band recorded their debut full-length album, ''[[Nothing Gold Can Stay (album)|Nothing Gold Can Stay]]'' (1999), initially selling one-page insert copies at their shows supporting [[MxPx]].<ref name="Oral3">{{Citation | title = 1999-2000: The Oral History of New Found Glory | url = http://i46.tinypic.com/2rz5rhg.jpg | newspaper = [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] | date = March 2010|author=Manley, Brendan|issue=260|page=64|access-date=January 31, 2010|issn = 1065-1667}}</ref> [[Richard Reines]], co-founder of [[Drive-Thru Records]] had also noted their devout following and held talks with the band. Drive-Thru subsequently signed the five-piece and paid Eulogy $5,000 to license ''Nothing Gold Can Stay'', which went on to sell more than 300,000 copies.<ref name="Oral3"/>

===Rise in popularity and stardom (2000–2005)===
The five-piece signed their first proper [[record contract|record deal]] with [[Drive-Thru Records]],<ref name="AMP">{{cite web|url=http://www.ampmagazine.com/index.php/interviews/comments/new_found_glory_shares_insight_on_their_new_upcoming_2009_album |title=New Found Glory Shares insight on their new upcoming 2009 Album |work=[[AMP (magazine)|AMP]]|author=Carlton, Liz |access-date=January 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121214143/http://ampmagazine.com/index.php/interviews/comments/new_found_glory_shares_insight_on_their_new_upcoming_2009_album |archive-date=January 21, 2009 }}</ref> and released an EP of [[cover songs]] from film soundtracks entitled ''[[From the Screen to Your Stereo]]'' in 2000. Drive-Thru's relationship with [[MCA Records]] ensured that the smaller label's more popular bands would be picked up by the major. Later that year, debut single "[[Hit or Miss (New Found Glory song)|Hit or Miss]]" peaked at No.&nbsp;15 on the [[US Modern Rock|US Modern Rock Chart]],<ref name="PopRadio">{{cite web|url=http://www.popradiotop20.com/Modern-Rock/NewFoundGlory.htm|title=Modern Rock Chart History New Found Glory|website=Popradiotop20.com|access-date=August 18, 2009}}</ref> which helped propel the band to a mainstream audience. Subsequently, their self-titled second album and major label debut ''[[New Found Glory (album)|New Found Glory]]'' (2000) reached number one on the ''Billboard'' [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers]] chart,<ref name="Self Titled">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r500248/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}}|title=New Found Glory > Charts & Awards > Billboard Albums|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=January 16, 2010}}</ref> and spent 21 weeks on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart.<ref name="BB">{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=new found glory|chart=Billboard 200}}|title=New Found Glory > Chart History|magazine=[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]|access-date=August 18, 2009}}</ref> In a ''[[Kerrang!]]'' magazine article years later, they referred to the album as the band's ''Essential Purchase''. They wrote, "marking one of the biggest and quickest improvements in [[alternative music]], the major label debut hurled them to the forefront of the [[Punk subculture|punk scene]] barely 12 months after its predecessor. Packed with infectious melodies and sing-along anthems, it would see them jostling with the likes of [[Blink-182]] for the genre's crown."<ref name="Kerrang2"/> The album also marked the official debut of the band's new moniker, which dropped the indefinite article "A" from their original name due to some fans struggling to find the band's records in stores.<ref name="Kerrang2"/> The album was certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] by the [[RIAA]].<ref name="riaa">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |title=RIAA Search - New Found Glory |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] |access-date=July 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626050454/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |archive-date=June 26, 2007 }}</ref> In 2001 the band performed at EdgeFest Calgary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chartattack.com/damn/2001/08/2413.cfm|title=LIVE: Edgefest Calgary|date=December 23, 2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011223040841/http://chartattack.com/damn/2001/08/2413.cfm|access-date=May 5, 2019|archive-date=December 23, 2001}}</ref>

Between 2002 and 2004, the band experienced the height of their popularity with headline slots on the [[Vans Warped Tour|Warped Tour]] with Blink-182 and a supporting tour with [[Green Day]]. Third album ''[[Sticks and Stones (New Found Glory album)|Sticks and Stones]]'' was released on June 11, 2002 and peaked at number four on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart.<ref name="BB"/> The record spawned two popular singles; "[[My Friends Over You]]" and "[[Head on Collision]]".<ref name="PopRadio"/> Following the success of the album, the band headlined the [[Warped Tour 2002|2002 Warped Tour]] and later saw the album certified gold by the RIAA.<ref name="riaa"/>

The lead single for their fourth album, "[[All Downhill from Here]]" reached number eleven in the Rock Chart before ''[[Catalyst (New Found Glory album)|Catalyst]]'' (2004) was released.
