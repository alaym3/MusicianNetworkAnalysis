==Life and career==
Born in [[Prokuplje]] and raised in the village of [[Žitorađa]], at the age of 15, Ceca rose to prominence as a recording artist for [[PGP-RTB]] with her debut album ''[[Cvetak zanovetak]]'' (1988), receiving the song of the year award for the title track at the [[Ilidža Folk Music Festival]]. She achieved further commercial success and acclaim in the 1990s by collaborating with song-writing duo [[Marina Tucaković]] and Milan Radulović on her signature hits, such as "Kukavica", "Volela sam, volela", "Beograd" and "Nevaljala". After releasing her best-selling album to date, ''[[Decenija]]'' (2001), she held a sold-out concert at the Belgrade's [[Red Star Stadium|Marakana]] stadium in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.novine.ca/ms/www.novine.ca/arhiva/2002/18_06_02/kultura.html|title=Ceca Ražnatović pdržala koncert na Marakani pred 70.000 ljudi|publisher=Nezavisne novine|access-date=30 September 2020|date=18 June 2002|language=sr}}</ref> Nevertheless, she managed to surpass that success in 2006 by performing at Belgrade's [[Ušće, Belgrade|Ušće]] in front of more than 100,000 fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pulsonline.rs/puls-poznatih/na-uscu-150000-ljudi-skandiralo-ceco-mi-te-volimo/52ns06k|title=Na Ušću 150.000 ljudi skandiralo "Ceco, mi te volimo"|website=pulsonline.rs|access-date=30 September 2020|language=sr}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hellomagazin.rs/2013/06/29/ceca-raznatovic-spektakl-na-uscu-pred-150-000-ljudi/|title=Ceca Ražnatović: Spektakl na Ušću pred 150.000 ljudi|publisher=Hello|access-date=30 September 2020|date=29 June 2013|language=sr}}</ref> Ceca has released sixteen albums to date.

Next to singing, Ražnatović also starred as [[Koštana]] in the [[Impure Blood (film)|film adaptation]] of [[Borisav Stanković]]'s novel ''[[Impure Blood]]'', but was eventually cut out from the picture due to poor critical reception. She has served as a judge on the televised singing contests ''[[Pinkove Zvezde]]'' (2014-2016) and ''[[Zvezde Granda]]'' (2021–present).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nova.rs/zabava/showbiz/ceca-stigla-na-prvo-snimanje-nove-sezone-zvezda-granda-foto/|title=Ceca stigla na prvo snimanje nove sezone Zvezda Granda|website=[[Nova S|Nova.rs]]|author=Dejanović, M.|access-date=7 September 2021|date=7 September 2020|language=sr}}</ref>

Ceca was married to career criminal and [[paramilitary]] commander in the [[Yugoslav Wars]], [[Arkan|Željko Ražnatović "Arkan"]], with whom she has two children. Their wedding, which was broadcast internationally, was portrayed as the "Serbian fairytale" by the local media.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraf.rs/jetset/vesti-jetset/3124900-nedelja-sve-po-obicajima-sutra-se-zeni-veljko-a-ovako-je-bilo-na-svadbi-cece-i-arkana-1995|title=Detalji svadbe Cece i Arkana 1995. godine koje ste možda zaboravili: Šta su joj ubacili u cipelu?|website=Telegraf.rs|author=Dejanović, M.|access-date=7 September 2021|date=23 November 2019|language=sr}}</ref> Many also think that Arkan's influence significantly contributed to Ceca's success.

However, despite her popularity, Ceca has been known as the subject of controversies.<ref name="Legal Issues">{{cite web|url=https://nova.rs/zabava/showbiz/kriminalni-estradni-dosijei-pljacke-pronevere-pucnjave/|title=Kriminalni estradni dosijei: pljačke, pronevere, pucnjave...|website=[[Nova S|nova.rs]]|date=August 19, 2020|access-date=7 September 2021|language=sr}}</ref> Following the [[Assassination of Zoran Đinđić|assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić]] in March 2003, Ražnatović was arrested for [[Illegal possession of a firearm|illegal firearm possession]] as a part of the police [[Operation Sabre (Serbia)|Operation Sabre]] and subsequently spent 121 days in commitment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/2230203.html|title=Serbian Pop Diva Investigated Over Soccer Transfers|publisher=rferl|access-date=25 November 2010|date=1 May 2013}}</ref><ref name="Legal Issues"/> In 2011, Ražnatović, who had pleaded guilty, was also charged for [[embezzlement]] from the transfers of football players as the head of her husband's club, [[FK Obilić]], and was sentenced with [[euros|€]]1,5 million fine and to a year in house arrest.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/29/serb-singer-ceca-charged|location=London|publisher=The Guardian|first=Ed|last=Vulliamy|title=Serbian singer Ceca charged with embezzlement|date=29 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/09/serbia-ceca-svetlana-raznatovic|title=Serbian pop singer Ceca, widow of warlord Arkan, avoids jail term|publisher=Guardian|access-date=9 May 2011|date=1 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/sr/story/135/Hronika/912962/Ceca+u+ku%C4%87nom+pritvoru.html|title=Ceca u kućnom pritvoru|publisher=RTS|access-date=22 June 2011|date=1 May 2013}}</ref> Moreover, due to her legal issues, Ražnatović is officially banned from entering [[Croatia]], being proclaimed ''persona non grata''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/ceca-persona-non-grata-u-hrvatskoj-mogu-se-samo-nasmijati-na-njihove-zabrane-nisam-se-nimalo-potresla.-moja-brojna-publika-iz-rh-uvijek-nade-put-do-mene-3707481|title=Ceca, Persona Non Grata u Hrvatskoj 'Mogu se samo nasmijati na njihove zabrane, nisam se nimalo potresla.
