'''Boston''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from namesake [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]], that had its most notable successes during the 1970s and 80s. The band's core members on their most popular recordings included [[multi-instrumentalist]] founder and leader [[Tom Scholz]], who played the majority of instruments on the debut album, and lead vocalist [[Brad Delp]], among a number of other musicians who varied from album to album.<ref name="amgov">{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=mn0000079960}}</ref> Boston's best-known songs include "[[More Than a Feeling]]", "[[Peace of Mind (Boston song)|Peace of Mind]]", "[[Foreplay/Long Time]]", "[[Rock and Roll Band]]", "[[Smokin' (Boston song)|Smokin']]", "[[Don't Look Back (Boston song)|Don't Look Back]]", "[[A Man I'll Never Be]]", and "[[Amanda (Boston song)|Amanda]]".

==History==
===Early years (1969–1975)===
Tom Scholz first started writing music in 1969 while he was attending [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), where he wrote an instrumental, titled "Foreplay".<ref name="bioofficial">{{cite web |url=http://www.bandboston.com/html/history_html.html |title=Official Boston Website – History |access-date=August 16, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601000627/http://www.bandboston.com/html/history_html.html |archive-date=June 1, 2012 }}</ref> While attending MIT, Scholz joined the band Freehold, where he met guitarist [[Barry Goudreau]] and drummer Jim Masdea,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bandboston.com/html/jm_html.html |title=Musicians |access-date=November 25, 2018 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608015726/http://www.bandboston.com/html/jm_html.html |archive-date=June 8, 2012 }}</ref> who would later become members of Boston. Vocalist [[Brad Delp]] was added to the collective in 1970.  After graduating with a master's degree,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alum.mit.edu|title=MIT Alumni Association's Infinite Connection – MIT Alumni Association's Infinite Connection|website=Alum.mit.edu|access-date=June 25, 2016}}</ref> Scholz worked for [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]], using his salary to build a recording studio in his basement, and to finance demo tapes recorded in professional [[recording studio]]s.<ref name="bioofficial"/> These early demo tapes were recorded with (at various times) Delp on vocals, Goudreau on guitar, Masdea on drums, and Scholz on guitar, bass and keyboards. The demo tapes were sent to record companies, but received consistent rejections.<ref name="bioofficial"/> In 1973 Scholz formed the band Mother's Milk with Delp, Goudreau, and Masdea.<ref name="bioofficial"/> That group disbanded by 1974, but Scholz subsequently worked with Masdea and Delp to produce six new demos, including "[[More Than a Feeling]]", "[[Peace of Mind (Boston song)|Peace of Mind]]", "[[Rock and Roll Band]]", "Something About You" (then entitled "Life Isn't Easy"), "Hitch a Ride" (then entitled "San Francisco Day"), and "Don't Be Afraid". Scholz stated they finished four of the six by the end of 1974, and they finished "More Than a Feeling" and "Something About You" in 1975.<ref>{{cite web|title=Feelin' Satisfied: An Interview with Tom Scholz of BOSTON|url=http://www.thirdstage.ca/boston/articles/online-articles/523-feelin-satisfied-an-interview-with-tom-scholz-of-boston|website=Thirdstage.ca|access-date=June 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=BOSTON shows, myths, and truths |author=Scholz, T. |author-link=Tom Scholz |url=http://www.rockhistorybook.com/artist/boston_tom_scholz_press_release_blog_april_2009.html |publisher=Rock History Book |access-date=June 13, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213145740/http://www.rockhistorybook.com/artist/boston_tom_scholz_press_release_blog_april_2009.html |archive-date=December 13, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Scholz played all the instruments on the demos, except for the drums, which were played by Masdea, and used self-designed pedals to create the desired guitar sounds.<ref name="bioofficial"/>

This final demo tape attracted the attention of promoters Paul Ahern and Charlie McKenzie.  Masdea left the band around this time. According to Scholz, the managers insisted that Masdea had to be replaced before the band could get a recording deal.<ref name="bioofficial"/> Years later, Delp told journalist Chuck Miller: "[Jim] actually told me he was losing interest in playing drums. I know Tom felt very bad when the whole thing happened. And then, of course, we started getting some interest."<ref name="miller-boston">{{cite web|url=http://www.chuckthewriter.com/boston.html |title=The Chuck Miller Creative Writing Service: Boston |website=Chuckthewriter.com |access-date=February 19, 2012}}</ref><ref name="musicians-magazine-87">{{cite web|url=http://www.gonnahitcharide.com/en/media-library/articles/musician-magazines/249-musician-magazine-1987 |title=Musician Magazine 1987 |website=Gonnahitcharide.com |access-date=February 19, 2012}}</ref> Scholz and Delp signed a deal with [[Epic Records]] after Masdea's departure, thanks to Ahern and McKenzie. Before the deal could be finalized, the band had to do a live audition for the record company executives. The duo recruited Goudreau on guitar, bassist [[Fran Sheehan]] and drummer [[Sib Hashian]] to create a performing unit which could replicate Scholz's richly layered recordings on stage. The showcase was a success and the band agreed to put out ten albums over the next six years.<ref name="bioofficial"/><ref name="miller-boston"/>

In addition to the firing of Masdea, the record label insisted that Scholz re-record the demo tapes in a professional studio. However, Scholz wanted to record them in his basement studio so that he could work at his own pace.<ref name="bioofficial"/>  Scholz and producer [[John Boylan (record producer)|John Boylan]] hatched a plan to send the rest of the band to Los Angeles to make the record label happy, while Scholz recorded most of Boston's debut album at home, with Masdea playing drums on the track "Rock and Roll Band" and Scholz playing the other instruments.<ref name="bioofficial"/> The multitrack tapes were then brought to [[Los Angeles]], where Delp added vocals and the album was mixed by Boylan. It was then that the band was named "Boston", by suggestion of Boylan and engineer Warren Dewey.<ref name="bioofficial"/>

===''Boston'' and ''Don't Look Back'' (1976–1978)===
[[Image:Brad Delp.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Brad Delp]], the original lead singer. Along with Scholz, Delp was the only other person signed to Epic Records as Boston.]]
The debut album, ''[[Boston (album)|Boston]]'', released on August 25, 1976, ranks as one of the best-selling debut albums in U.S. history with over 17 million copies sold.<ref>{{cite news |last=Zito |first=Tom |date=December 13, 1976 |title=Boston Group and How It Grew |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |page=F20 |quote=On Aug. 23, 1976, their first LP simply titled "Boston" was shipped to record stores. }}</ref><ref name="nme">{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.ie/music/feature/Top-5-best-selling-debut-albums/201/4830.htm |title=Music &#124; Top 5 best-selling debut albums |website=Entertainment.ie |date=November 20, 2013 |access-date=March 23, 2017}}</ref>

During late summer and early fall of 1976, Boston attracted publicity due to the record sales. However, there was "a conscious effort to de-emphasize Scholz as the total mastermind behind Boston".<ref name="crowe">{{cite magazine |last=Crowe |first=Cameron |magazine=Rolling Stone |title=The Band from the Platinum Basement |url=http://www.theuncool.com/2013/11/25/archives-boston-takes-over/ |access-date=November 25, 2018}}</ref> After opening for [[Black Sabbath]], [[Blue Öyster Cult]], [[Foghat]] and others in the fall, the band embarked on a headlining tour in the winter and spring of 1976–1977 to support the album.<ref name="bostonorghistory">{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.org/faqtext.html |title=SECTION 1: HISTORY OF BOSTON v2.01 |website=Boston.org |access-date=August 16, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214062731/http://www.boston.org/faqtext.html |archive-date=February 14, 2009  }}</ref> This helped establish Boston as one of rock's top acts within a short time, being nominated for a [[Grammy award]] as a "Best New Artist".<ref name="bostonorghistory"/><ref name="rockwell">Rockwell, Jorn (February 12, 1977).

The album spawned three singles, "More Than a Feeling", "Long Time", and "Peace of Mind", all of which made the national charts.<ref name="bostonorghistory"/> Additionally, the album peaked at No.&nbsp;3 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and remained on the charts for 132 weeks.<ref name="billboarddebut">{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200?chartDate=1976-12-11 |title=Music Albums, Top 200 Albums & Music Album Charts Billboard.com |work=Billboard  |access-date=August 16, 2009}}</ref>

Despite having problems with manager Paul Ahern, being caught in the middle of a fight between Ahern and his business partner Charles McKenzie, and doing most of the recording work alone,<ref name="crowe"/> Scholz completed the second Boston album two years after the debut album's release. The second album, ''[[Don't Look Back (Boston album)|Don't Look Back]]'', was released by Epic in August 1978.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

At the time this was considered a long gap between albums, but Scholz still considered ''Don't Look Back'' to be a rush job and was unhappy with the album's second side in particular.<ref name="officialdlb">{{cite web |url=http://www.bandboston.com/html/album2_html.html |title=Official Boston Website – Don't Look Back – 1978 |last=Wild |first=David |access-date=August 16, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504075530/http://www.bandboston.com/html/album2_html.html |archive-date=May 4, 2009  }}</ref> Overall, ''Don't Look Back'' sold about half as well as the debut album, eventually selling over 7 million records.<ref name="riaa">{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS |title=RIAA – Gold & Platinum – August 17, 2009 |publisher=RIAA |access-date=August 16, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225031458/http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS |archive-date=February 25, 2013 }}</ref>

Another tour followed (playing with the likes of [[AC/DC]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[Van Halen]], [[Sammy Hagar]] and [[The Doobie Brothers]]),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/van-halen-1978-tour-highlights/|title=How Van Halen Conquered the World in Just 10 Shows|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|access-date=July 15, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ac-dc.net/archive/acdc_tour_history.php?date_id=1302|title=AC/DC Tour History - 27 May 1979 Orlando (Tangerine Bowl)|website=Ac-dc.net|access-date=July 15, 2021}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160613021840/http://rocktourdatabase.com/tours/dont-look-back] </ref> and the album's title track became a top-5 hit. Additionally, two other singles, "[[A Man I'll Never Be]]" and "[[Feelin' Satisfied]]", went top 40 and top 50, respectively.<ref name="bostonorghistory"/> Despite the success, Scholz's relationship with Ahern completely deteriorated.<ref name="Ahern vs. Scholz">{{cite web |url=http://media.ca1.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/getopn.pl?OPINION=95-1146.01A |title=U.S. First Circuit Court of Appeals – USCA1 Opinion – 95-1146.01A |access-date=July 7, 2014}}</ref> Delayed by technical renovations to his studio, Scholz eventually began the process of working on Boston's third album, determined to complete the album at his own pace and up to his demanding standard.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

===Solo projects and CBS lawsuit (1979–1985)===
In late 1979, Scholz began writing new material, but Boston's former co-manager, Paul Ahern, argued that, according to an agreement Scholz had signed years earlier with Ahern, Ahern owned a percentage of all songs Scholz wrote from that point on.<ref name="Ahern vs. Scholz"/> Delayed further by the dispute, Scholz suggested that in the meantime the individual members should work on whatever other projects they might be considering.
Goudreau then decided to record a solo album that featured Boston members Delp and Hashian, and which was recorded with the help of Paul Grupp,<ref>{{cite web |last=Grupp |first=Paul |title="Paul Grupp – Discography Credits ("worked with")" |url=http://paulgrupp.com/worked_with_credits.html |access-date=July 29, 2012}}</ref> an engineer and producer familiar with Scholz's studio techniques.<ref name="bostonorghistory"/> The album, released in 1980, was titled ''[[Barry Goudreau (album)|Barry Goudreau]]'' and featured the minor hit single "Dreams". There was tension when [[CBS]]'s marketing connected Goudreau's solo album to Boston's signature guitar sound, despite Scholz not having played at all on this album.<ref name="officialdlb"/><ref name="officialb">{{cite web |url=http://www.bandboston.com/html/album1_html.html |title=Official Boston Website – Boston |last=Scholz |first=Tom |access-date=August 20, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608015621/http://www.bandboston.com/html/album1_html.html |archive-date=June 8, 2012  }}</ref> Scholz objected to the ad copy, but it became irrelevant when [[Epic Records|Epic]] dropped promotion on Goudreau's album citing lack of interest. Goudreau left the band in 1981 and formed [[Orion the Hunter (band)|Orion the Hunter]]. Delp contributed vocals and co-wrote songs on the debut album, but returned to Boston and recorded vocals on the third Boston album.<ref name="bostonorghistory"/>

While Scholz and Delp were recording new material for the third Boston album, CBS filed a $60 million lawsuit against Scholz, alleging breach of contract for failing to deliver a new Boston album on time.<ref name="bostonorghistory"/>

During this same period, Scholz founded his high-tech company [[Scholz Research & Development]] (SR&D), which made amplifiers and other musical electronic equipment. Its most famous product, the [[Rockman (amplifier)|Rockman amplifier]], was introduced in 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockman.fr/Products/List.htm |title=SR&D Rockman products list |website=Rockman.fr |access-date=February 19, 2012}}</ref>

The legal trouble slowed progress toward the completion of the next album, which took six years to record and produce. Joining Scholz in the album's development again were Delp and Jim Masdea.<ref name="officialts">{{cite web |url=http://www.bandboston.com/html/album3_html.html |title=Official Boston Website – Third Stage – 1986 |last=Scholz |first=Tom |access-date=August 20, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608015731/http://www.bandboston.com/html/album3_html.html |archive-date=June 8, 2012  }}</ref> In 1985, guitarist [[Gary Pihl]] left [[Sammy Hagar]]'s touring band to work with Scholz as both a musician and an [[Scholz Research & Development, Inc.|SR&D]] executive. As CBS v. Scholz played out in court, CBS opted to withhold royalty payments to Scholz, hoping to force him to settle on unfavorable terms.<ref name="bostonorghistory"/>

The lawsuit's first round was eventually decided in Scholz's favor, and Scholz moved the band to [[MCA Records]].<ref name="bostonorghistory"/>

The CBS case took seven years to run its course, and in April 1990 Scholz won.<ref name="bostonorghistory"/>

===''Third Stage'' (1986–1988)===
Despite the adversity, progress continued to be made on the third Boston album. A tape of one of the songs, "[[Amanda (Boston song)|Amanda]]", leaked out of the studio in 1984. The song became the lead single when ''[[Third Stage]]'' was finally released on September 23, 1986.<ref name="Boston Encyclo Ref">{{cite encyclopedia |year=1995 |title=Boston |encyclopedia=The New Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll |publisher=Simon & Schuster Inc. |location =New York, NY |id =0-684-81044-1}}</ref>

The album and lead single "Amanda" both went to No.&nbsp;1 on ''Billboard'', and the subsequent singles "[[We're Ready]]" and "Can'tcha Say" were top 10 and top 30, respectively.<ref name="bostonorghistory"/> "Cool the Engines" also got significant airplay on rock radio. The album sold over 4 million copies.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

The group headed off on tour to promote ''Third Stage'' in 1987 and 1988. ''Third Stage'' was played in sequence in its entirety during the shows, with expanded arrangements of some cuts. Boston opened with "Rock and Roll Band" and brought back the original drummer, Jim Masdea, to play drums for this one song. For the tour, the group was joined by Doug Huffman and David Sikes, both of whom stayed with the band into the mid-1990s.<ref name="bostonorghistory"/>

===Departure of Delp; ''Walk On'' (1989–1996)===
By spring 1990, Scholz was back in the studio working on the band's fourth studio album.<ref name="bostonorghistory"/> Later that year, Delp told Scholz he wanted to concentrate on other projects, and might not be available for some time.<ref>(2007) ''Limelight Magazine''.</ref> With Delp's departure, Scholz was then the last remaining original member. Before he left, Delp co-wrote with Scholz and David Sikes the song "Walk On", which eventually became the title track of the new album.<ref name="officialwo">{{cite web |url=http://www.bandboston.com/html/album4_html.html |title=Official Boston Website – Walk On – 1994 |last=Scholz |first=Tom |access-date=August 20, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624212543/http://www.bandboston.com/html/album4_html.html |archive-date=June 24, 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

Delp subsequently joined Barry Goudreau's new band, [[Return to Zero (rock band)|RTZ]].<ref name="bostonorghistory"/> Scholz eventually replaced him with vocalist Fran Cosmo, who had been in Goudreau's previous band [[Orion the Hunter (band)|Orion the Hunter]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

For the second album in a row, and for the second time in a decade, Scholz's work was delayed by renovations to his studio. In the end, eight years passed between ''Third Stage'' and ''Walk On'', which was released in June 1994. ''Walk On'' was certified platinum by the [[RIAA]], and reached No.&nbsp;7 on the ''Billboard'' Top 200 Albums chart.<ref name="bostonorghistory"/> Unlike Boston's previous albums, it failed to chart in the top 5. It produced one hit single, "[[I Need Your Love (Boston song)|I Need Your Love]]", which was widely played on some rock radio stations.<ref name="bostonorghistory"/> Delp reunited with Boston at the end of 1994. Their first appearance was for two benefit shows at the House of Blues on December 12–13, 1994, in Cambridge.<ref name="bostonorghistory"/> The band also handed a check of $5,000 to Globe Santa and another check of $5,000 to Operation Christmas in Fall River.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&p_theme=bg&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EADE11C7A778768&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=SCHOLZ AND BOSTON ROCK TO PERFECTION FOR A CAUSE |date=December 13, 1994 |last=Morse |first=Steve |access-date=September 11, 2009}}</ref>

The group, with Delp now back in the band, toured in the summer of 1995 with both Cosmo and Delp combining vocals. By that time drummer Huffman had been replaced by Curly Smith, who was previously with [[Jo Jo Gunne]].<ref name="bostonorghistory"/>  Following the conclusion of the "Livin' For You" tour in 1995, Scholz announced that a greatest hits album would be released.<ref name="bostonorghistory"/> Initially planned for release in August 1996, the album was pushed back to a 1997 release date.<ref name="bostonorghistory"/>

===''Greatest Hits'' and ''Corporate America'' (1997–2006)===
Boston released a compilation album in 1997, titled simply ''[[Greatest Hits (Boston album)|Boston: Greatest Hits]]''. The album featured all of the band's hit singles except "We're Ready", "Can'tcha Say (You Believe In Me)/Still In Love", and "I Need Your Love" along with three new songs, "Higher Power", "Tell Me", and an instrumental version of the "[[Star Spangled Banner]]". Smith and Sikes left the band in late 1997 and recorded an album together.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bandboston.com/html/ds_html.html |title=Official Boston Website – David Sikes |access-date=September 11, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217214436/http://www.bandboston.com/html/ds_html.html |archive-date=December 17, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Scholz headed back to the studio in 1998 to begin work on a fifth album, which eventually turned out to be ''[[Corporate America (album)|Corporate America]]''. The title track of "Corporate America" was uploaded by Tom Scholz to [[MP3.com]] under the pseudonym of "Downer's Revenge" in early 2002 in order to test the album's appeal to a younger demographic.<ref name="yahoo">{{cite web |url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/boston/news/bostons-new-song-popular--just-not-under-the-bands-name--12056773 |date=September 18, 2002 |publisher=Yahoo! |last=Simon |first=Bruce |title=Boston's New Song Popular—Just Not Under The Band's Name |access-date=September 11, 2009}}</ref> The song reached No.&nbsp;2 on the progressive rock charts on the website for two weeks.<ref name="yahoo"/>

On March 9, 2007, lead singer Delp died by suicide at his home in [[Atkinson, New Hampshire]].<ref name="delpsuicide">{{cite web |url=http://www.guitarworld.com/article/brad_delp_details_emerge_about_his_tragic_suicide |date=April 27, 2007 |title=Brad Delp: Details Emerge About His Tragic Suicide |work=Guitar World |access-date=September 11, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830024012/http://www.guitarworld.com/article/brad_delp_details_emerge_about_his_tragic_suicide |archive-date=August 30, 2009 }}</ref> Police found him dead in his master bathroom, along with several notes for whomever would find him.<ref name="delpsuicide"/> In the bathroom where he died, two charcoal grills were found on the bathroom fixtures, and the door was sealed with duct tape and a towel underneath.<ref name="delpsuicide"/> Police called the death "untimely" and said no foul play was indicated.<ref name="delpeagletribune">{{cite web |url=http://www.eagletribune.com/punewsnh/local_story_069094553?keyword=topstory+page=0 |title=Brad Delp, lead singer for band Boston and Merrimack Valley resident, dies |work=Eagle Tribune |date=March 10, 2007 |last=Benson |first=Jessica |access-date=September 11, 2009}}</ref> Delp was alone at the time of his death, according to the police report.

A concert in honor of Delp named "Come Together: A Tribute to Brad Delp" occurred on August 19, 2007, at the Bank of America Pavilion in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. The concert included [[Ernie and the Automatics]], [[Beatlejuice]], Farrenheit, [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]], [[Godsmack]], [[Return to Zero (rock band)|RTZ]], [[Orion the Hunter (band)|Orion the Hunter]], and finally the current version of Boston.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/blog/2007/07/brad_delpboston.html |title=Brad Delp-Boston Tribute Take Two |date=July 2, 2007 |last=Rodman |first=Sarah |access-date=September 11, 2009 |work=The Boston Globe}}</ref>

All of the living members of Boston were invited to perform in the concert. The singers for Boston included [[Michael Sweet]] of [[Stryper]], former band member Curly Smith, band member Kimberley Dahme, and a Boston fan from North Carolina named [[Tommy DeCarlo]], who was chosen to sing based on his performances of Boston cover songs on his [[MySpace]] page.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tommydecarlo.com/ |title=Tommy DeCarlo :: Home|website=Tommydecarlo.com |access-date=September 11, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/boston-find-new-lead-singer-on-myspace-157345 |title=Boston find new lead singer – on MySpace |website=MusicRadar.com |date=May 30, 2008 |access-date=September 11, 2009}}</ref>

===New line-up and intermittent performances (2008–2012)===
The ongoing conflicts among the surviving band members spilled over to the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 Presidential campaign]]. Barry Goudreau appeared with [[Mike Huckabee]] and played with him at some rallies in New Hampshire.<ref name="foxnews">{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Feb15/0,4670,HuckabeeBostonBand,00.html |title=Rocker Tells Huckabee to Lay Off Song |date=February 15, 2008 |last=Ramer |first=Holly |publisher=Fox News |access-date=September 11, 2009}}</ref> Huckabee used "[[More Than a Feeling]]" as a [[Mike Huckabee presidential campaign, 2008|campaign]] theme song.<ref name="foxnews"/> Scholz, a self-described "[[Barack Obama|Obama]] supporter",<ref name="huckabee">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/02/14/more-than-a-feeling-writer-says-mike-huckabee-has-caused-him-damagen |title="More Than a Feeling" Writer Says Mike Huckabee Has Caused Him "Damage" |date=February 14, 2008 |access-date=September 11, 2009 |work=Rolling Stone}}{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> sent an open letter to Huckabee in February 2008 stating that the band had never endorsed any candidate, and that he had never authorized the use of "More Than a Feeling" as Huckabee's theme song.<ref name="foxnews"/> Scholz made a point of saying that he, and not Goudreau or Sheehan, actually played all the guitars on "More Than a Feeling" as well as most of Boston's songs.<ref name="huckabee"/> Huckabee eventually stopped using the song for his campaign.

In the spring of 2008, Scholz and Sweet introduced a new Boston lineup, which subsequently did a North American summer tour, playing 53 dates in 12 weeks (on a double bill with [[Styx (band)|Styx]]). Scholz was the only founding member of Boston to play on the tour, although longtime member [[Gary Pihl]] was also part of the band, and Dahme and Neal returned on bass and drums, respectively. DeCarlo and Sweet shared lead vocals.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

Scholz and Pihl led the band on a 2012 North American tour, beginning on June 28, 2012, at the Seminole [[Hard Rock Live]] arena in [[Hollywood, Florida]] and ending on September 8 at the U.S. Cellular Grandstand in [[Hutchinson, Kansas]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gonnahitcharide.com/en/news/6-the-band-boston-announces-2012-tour-dates-the-band-boston-announces-2012-tour-dates |title=The Band Boston Announces 2012 Tour Dates |date=February 15, 2012 |access-date=April 21, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bandboston.com/html/tour_html.html |title=Tour Dates |access-date=November 25, 2018 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121227105148/http://www.bandboston.com/html/tour_html.html |archive-date=December 27, 2012 }}</ref> Victor and DeCarlo shared lead vocals, with drummer Curly Smith returning for the first time in over a decade, and former Stryper member [[Tracy Ferrie]] on bass. Neither Dahme nor Neal played on the tour.

===''Life, Love & Hope'' (2013–2017)===
Boston's sixth album, ''[[Life, Love & Hope]]'', was released on December 3, 2013, by Frontiers Records; it includes lead vocals from Brad Delp, Tommy DeCarlo, Kimberley Dahme, David Victor, and Tom Scholz. Work on the album started in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/life-love-hope/boston%7D|title=Life Love & Hope by Boston|website=Metacritic.com|access-date=June 25, 2016}}</ref> On December 11, 2013, Boston re-recorded a Christmas song, "God Rest Ye Metal Gentleman 2013"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/boston-release-new-christmas-single-god-rest-ye-metal-gentlemen|title=Boston Release New Christmas Single, "God Rest Ye Metal Gentlemen"|date=December 11, 2013|website=Guitarworld.com|access-date=June 25, 2016}}</ref> (previously released in 2002 as "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"). In 2014 Boston embarked on the "Heaven on Earth Tour" spanning the United States and Japan with a lineup including Scholz, Pihl, DeCarlo, Victor and Ferrie. Dahme returned, this time performing rhythm guitar and vocals, and drumming duties were split between Neal and Smith, with Neal handling the first leg of the tour. Victor departed the lineup partway through the tour for unspecified reasons. In his stead, [[Siobhan Magnus]] joined the tour as a guest vocalist in July, performing lead vocals on 'Walk On'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bandboston.com|title=Just another band out of BOSTON – Official Website|website=Bandboston.com|access-date=June 25, 2016}}</ref>

In 2015, Boston launched another tour with a lineup consisting of Scholz, Pihl, DeCarlo, Ferrie and new member [[Beth Cohen (musician)|Beth Cohen]], who performed keyboards, rhythm guitar and vocals. Cohen had previously recorded with the group on both ''Corporate America'' and ''Life, Love & Hope'' as a vocalist and flautist. Initially, the lineup was to include former [[Spock's Beard]] drummer and vocalist [[Nick D'Virgilio]] for its first month of shows, with Neal then returning, but D'Virgilio proved "not the right fit" and Smith rejoined in his place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thirdstage.ca/boston/news/2015-archive/901-meet-nick-dvirgilio/|title=Meet Nick D'Virgilio|date=April 30, 2015|website=Third Stage|access-date= July 19, 2017}}</ref> This seven-person lineup proved Boston's most stable lineup in some time, touring as well in the summers of 2016 and 2017. The 2016 tour marked the group's 40th anniversary and included shows in Boston's [[Wang Theatre]], their first full performances in their namesake town since 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/2016/03/28/boston-40th-anniversary-tour/|title=Boston to end 40th anniversary tour with rare show in Boston|last=Collis|first=Clark|date=March 28, 2016|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date= July 19, 2017}}</ref>

===Upcoming seventh album (2017–present)===
In April 2017, Scholz reported that he has been writing new material for the seventh Boston album. He told ''[[Sun Herald]]'', "I find that I'm in a position that I really need to write things that we can play at the shows. We play basically everything that people expect to hear that we can fit into two hours. We also do a lot of things that aren't on any of the records by adding things and segues and instrumental parts, so I always have to come up with new stuff. It's quite a challenge. I have to write new things for the tour every year, which is what I wanted to do in the first place. But I got sidetracked in the studio, recording. Now, I'm actually a performing musician, and I have to tell you, it's much more fun."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sunherald.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/by-the-way/article145933904.html|title=Catching up with Boston's Tom Scholz before 'Hyper Space' hits the Coast|last=Clark|first=Jeff|date=April 21, 2017|website=[[Sun Herald]]|access-date=December 23, 2018}}</ref> When asked the same month about a potential release date of the album, Scholz said, "Who knows?

===Appearances===
*''[[Boston (album)|Boston]]'' – Two long lines of guitar shaped starships flee a planet that is breaking apart. The ships all have blue flames coming out of the bottom.
*''[[Don't Look Back (Boston album)|Don't Look Back]]'' – The Boston ship is flying low or perhaps hovering over a grassy, crystalline planet. The ship has searchlights on.
*''[[Third Stage]]'' – The Boston ship is headed towards a large flat spaceship resembling a bank of pipe organ pipes over a blue planet.
*''[[Walk On (Boston album)|Walk On]]'' – The Boston ship is shown crashing through a rock outcropping.

*''[[Life, Love & Hope]]'' – The Boston ship is flying in space, near a nebula.

Their spaceship also appeared on their tours in the late 1980s, early 1990s, and early 2000s in the form of a giant lighting rig and accompanied on stage by their giant pipe-organ set piece, which is known to Boston insiders as Bertha because of its sheer size.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

==Innovation and style==
Boston's genre is considered by most to be [[hard rock]] and [[arena rock]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NNVDBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA164|title=Rock'n America: A Social and Cultural History|last=Weinstein|first=Deena|date=2015|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9781442600157|page=164}}</ref> while combining elements of [[progressive rock]] into its music.<ref name="yahoo" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/boston/albums/album/300997/review/6068063/boston |title=Boston: Boston Music Reviews |date=October 7, 1976 |last=Nicholson |first=Kris |work=Rolling Stone |access-date=November 6, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317231314/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/boston/albums/album/300997/review/6068063/boston |archive-date=March 17, 2007 }}</ref>

Boston founder, guitarist, and primary songwriter Tom Scholz's blend of musical styles, ranging from classical to 1960s English pop, has resulted in a unique sound, most consistently realized on the first two albums (''Boston'' and ''Don't Look Back''). This sound is characterized by multiple lead and blended [[harmony|harmonies]] guitar work (usually harmonized in thirds), often alternating between and then mixing [[electric guitar|electric]] and [[Steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitar]]s. The band's harmonic style has been characterized as being "violin-like" without using synthesizers.<ref>"No Synthesizers. That's right! Honest! And no violins either. In other words, the Boston sound is powered by old, straight ahead rock-n-roll equipment, as opposed to midi-interconnected-computer-sequenced synthesizers."{{cite web|title=Official Boston Website|url=http://www.bandboston.com/html/album3_html.html|access-date=December 21, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608015731/http://www.bandboston.com/html/album3_html.html|archive-date=June 8, 2012}}</ref> Scholz is well-regarded for the development of complex, multi-tracked guitar harmonies. Another contributing factor is the use of handmade, [[high-tech]] equipment, such as the [[Rockman (music)|Rockman]], used by artists such as [[Journey (band)|Journey]] guitarist [[Neal Schon]], the band [[ZZ Top]], and [[Ted Nugent]]. [[Def Leppard]]'s album ''[[Hysteria (Def Leppard album)|Hysteria]]'' was created using only Rockman [[technology]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Scholz's production style combines deep, aggressive, comparatively short guitar [[riff]]ing and nearly ethereal, generally longer note vocal harmonies. A heavier, lower, and darker overall approach came in the next two albums (''Third Stage'' and ''Walk On''). The original track "Higher Power", on the ''Greatest Hits'' album, exhibits a near [[Neue Deutsche Härte]] and almost techno influence with its sequencer-sounding keyboards, a sound most fully realized on ''Corporate America'''s title track.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Tom Scholz also credited the late [[Brad Delp]] with helping to create Boston's sound with his signature vocal style. Delp, who was strongly influenced by the [[The Beatles|Beatles]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gonnahitcharide.com/en/media-library/articles/web/304-brad-delp-interview-by-par-winberg/ |title=Brad Delp interview by Par Winberg |website=Gonnahitcharide.com |access-date=February 19, 2012}}</ref> was well known for his extended vocal range, shown on hits such as "[[More Than a Feeling]]".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07071/768874-387.stm |title=RIP Brad Delp (1951–2007) |date=March 12, 2007 |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |access-date=November 6, 2009}}</ref>
