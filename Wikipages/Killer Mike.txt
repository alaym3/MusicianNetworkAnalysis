'''Michael Santiago Render''' (born April 20, 1975), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Killer Mike''', is an American rapper, actor, and activist. Mike made his debut on [[Outkast]]'s 2000 LP ''[[Stankonia]]'', and later appeared on their [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-winning single "[[The Whole World]]" from their greatest hits album ''[[Big Boi and Dre Present... Outkast]]'' (2001). He has since released five full-length albums as a solo artist. He is the founder of Grind Time Official Records, which he launched through [[SMC Recordings|SMC]] and [[Fontana Distribution]]. 

In December 2008, Mike signed to fellow Atlanta-based rapper [[T.I.]]'s [[Grand Hustle Records]]. In 2012, he released ''[[R.A.P. Music]]'', produced entirely by American rapper and producer [[El-P]]. Killer Mike and El-P subsequently formed the duo [[Run the Jewels]] in 2013; they were signed to [[Fool's Gold Records]] and released their [[Run the Jewels (album)|self-titled debut]] in June of that year.

Mike is also known as a social and political activist, focusing on subjects including [[social inequality]], [[police brutality]], and [[systemic racism]]. In addition to addressing themes of racism and police brutality in his music, he has also delivered several lectures at colleges and universities, written about social justice topics for publications such as ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', and been the subject of interviews regarding police misconduct and race relations. He was a visible and vocal supporter of [[Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016|Bernie Sanders' 2016 U.S. presidential campaign]], refusing to support [[Hillary Clinton]] after Sanders left the race, and again supporting Sanders in [[Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2020|his 2020 presidential campaign]].

Mike has appeared in films such as ''[[Idlewild (film)|Idlewild]]'', ''[[Baby Driver]]'', and ''[[ATL (film)|ATL]]''. The documentary series ''[[Trigger Warning with Killer Mike]]'', in which he explores issues in the U.S. that affect the black community, premiered on [[Netflix]] in January 2019.

===Graffitis SWAG Barbershop===
Mike and his wife, Shana, opened a barbershop in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] on November 1, 2011. The two acquired and reworked a barbershop and named it "Graffitis SWAG" (Shave, Wash, And Groom). He had waited nine years before choosing to open the barbershop, after having an early business manager advise him against the plan. It took his wife advising him to do it now while he had the time and money to pursue his lifelong dream. He eventually plans to open 150 shops across the United States over time, predominantly in cities with large black communities.<ref name=BarberSchools>{{cite web |last=Physioc |first=Heather E. |url=http://www.barber-schools.org/blog/killer-mikes-barber-shop-in-atlanta-ga-graffiti-swag |title=Killer Mike's Barbershop in Atlanta, GA - Graffiti's SWAG |website=Barber-Schools.org |date=July 2, 2012 |access-date=July 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705210418/http://www.barber-schools.org/blog/killer-mikes-barber-shop-in-atlanta-ga-graffiti-swag |archive-date=July 5, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The barbershop is decorated with artwork on the walls honoring historic black leaders, including [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] Mike said that he hopes to "lift up men in the community who are out of work and help move them toward sustainable, lifelong careers" and give his employees "opportunity for real economic elevation". As of 2012, the shop employed six barbers, with plans to add four to six more licensed barbers to the team. Mike also said that he hoped to pursue his own barber license in the winter of 2012.<ref name=BarberSchools/>

The enterprise has been successful and the shop has become a gathering place for the community, in addition to hosting events such as a season premiere for ''[[The Boondocks (TV series)|The Boondocks]]'' and serving as the setting for several music videos.

In an [[op-ed]] published in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine, Killer Mike stated that "there is no reason that Mike Brown and also [[Death of Eric Garner|Eric Garner]] are dead today—except bad policing, excessive force, and the hunt-and-capture-prey mentality many thrill-seeking cops have adapted".<ref name=Billboard_op-ed>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/6221888/op-ed-killer-mike-on-the-problems-underlying-the-chaos-in-ferguson |title=Op-Ed: Killer Mike on the Problems Underlying the Chaos in Ferguson |newspaper=Billboard |date=August 19, 2014 |author=Killer Mike |access-date=April 22, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502045520/http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/6221888/op-ed-killer-mike-on-the-problems-underlying-the-chaos-in-ferguson |archive-date=May 2, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Commenting on the [[2015 Baltimore uprising]] related to the [[death of Freddie Gray]], Killer Mike noted that he understood the frustrations leading to violent demonstrations, but encouraged protesters to use their energy to organize for lasting change. In a ''Billboard'' op-ed, Mike stated:

{{quote|For the people of Baltimore—I don't criticize rioting because I understand it. But after the fires die down: organize, strategize, and mobilize. Like Ferguson, you have an opportunity to start anew. I don't have a solution because whoever's there will have to come up with it.

He made similar points in an interview with the ''[[Harvard Political Review]]'': "Baltimore is an opportunity for us to do something different.
