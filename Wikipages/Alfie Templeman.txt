In 2016 he began recording and releasing demos at the age of 13.<ref name="Clash">{{cite web |url=https://www.clashmusic.com/next-wave/next-wave-910-alfie-templeman |title=Next Wave #910: Alfie Templeman |work=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]] |date=24 June 2019 |accessdate=13 June 2020 |author=Hansen, Susan}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://slantedpress.com/articles/spotlight-alfie-templeman |title=Spotlight: Alfie Templeman |work=Slanted Press |date=27 March 2019 |accessdate=13 June 2020 |author=Standring, Ben}}</ref> Templeman made his professional solo debut in 2018 and has released four extended plays since then.

==Early life==
Templeman was born in [[Carlton, Bedfordshire|Carlton]], Bedfordshire.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.readdork.com/features/alfie-templeman-interview-feb19 |title=Alfie Templeman is a name you need to know for 2019: "I'm not interested in anything else apart from music" |work=[[Dork (magazine)|Dork]] |date=13 February 2019 |accessdate=13 June 2020 |author=Muir, Jamie}}</ref> He cites the area as an influence on his music.<ref name=":2" /><ref name="Clash"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://diymag.com/2019/06/05/get-to-know-alfie-templeman-interview |title=Get To Know... Alfie Templeman |work=[[DIY (magazine)|DIY]] |date=5 June 2019 |accessdate=13 June 2020}}</ref>

Templeman grew up around his father's collection of guitars and his sister, whose musical talents included playing the piano and trumpet. Templeman has stated this is what "[drew him] into the world of music".<ref name=":2" />

At the age of seven, he developed an interest in drums and received his first guitar at age eight.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://thelast-magazine.com/alfie-templeman-musician-like-an-animal-stop-thinking-about-me-interview-profile/|title=Alfie Templeman Is the Nicest Guy in Music|last=Pitcher|first=Laura|date=2 April 2019|website=THE LAST MAGAZINE|language=en|access-date=19 November 2019}}</ref><ref name=":1" /> Until then, he'd taught himself how to play his father's left-handed guitars upside down.<ref name=":2" /> Self-taught at everything apart from drums, Templeman began recording at home and making CDs with his friends at age ten.<ref name=":2" /> By the time he turned 13, he had already acquired a fair understanding of music production software on his own and began working on creating full-length tracks.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/alfie-templeman-mn0003785530/biography|title=Alfie Templeman {{!}} Biography & History|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=19 November 2019}}</ref><ref name=":1" /> His mother encouraged him to sing. Templeman transitioned from producing simple instrumentals to fully-formed compositions.

==Career==
In 2018, Templeman recorded and released his debut single "Orange Juice", followed soon after by his debut EP, ''Like an Animal'', released in October 2018 by Chess Club Records.<ref name=":3" /> Templeman wrote, performed and recorded his debut EP ''Like an Animal'' in his bedroom after school.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=Less|first=Baylee|date=1 March 2020|title=Escaping Monotony: An Interview with Alfie Templeman|url=https://atwoodmagazine.com/atdw-alfie-templeman-interview-2020/|access-date=4 October 2020|website=[[Atwood Magazine]]}}</ref> Before signing with Chess Club, Templeman would upload his music on [[Spotify]] and was noticed when he featured on their "Discover Weekly" playlist.<ref name=":2" />

After completing his [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSEs]], Templeman left high school in 2019 at 16 years old to pursue a full-time music career.<ref>{{Cite web|title=On The Rise: Alfie Templeman|url=https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/features/interviews/alfie-templeman-on-the-rise|access-date=11 October 2019|website=The Line of Best Fit|language=en}}</ref>

Following the success of his debut, Templeman released his second EP, ''Sunday Morning Cereal'', in June 2019 and his third EP, ''Don't Go Wasting Time'', later that same year.

In April 2019, Templeman performed at the [[O2 Brixton Academy|O2 Academy Brixton]]<ref>{{Cite web|last=Pitcher|first=Laura|date=2 April 2019|title=Alfie Templeman Is the Nicest Guy in Music|url=https://thelast-magazine.com/alfie-templeman-musician-like-an-animal-stop-thinking-about-me-interview-profile/|access-date=13 October 2020|website=THE LAST MAGAZINE|language=en}}</ref> supporting [[Sundara Karma]] and has also supported Sports Team on their UK tour and played the Five Day Forecast and [[Eurosonic Noorderslag|Eurosonic]] in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Pitcher|first=Laura|date=2 April 2019|title=Alfie Templeman Is the Nicest Guy in Music|url=https://thelast-magazine.com/alfie-templeman-musician-like-an-animal-stop-thinking-about-me-interview-profile/|access-date=13 October 2020|website=THE LAST MAGAZINE|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Chess Club signee Alfie Templeman drops "Don't Go Wasting Time" and announces his third EP|url=https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/new-music/song-of-the-day/alfie-templeman-dont-go-wasting-time|access-date=13 October 2020|website=The Line of Best Fit|language=en}}</ref> In January 2020, Templeman started his first mini-tour, with first performing at Headrow House in Leeds, on the 17th January, before selling out his first London headline show at Colours, Hoxton. His 2020 single "Happiness in Liquid Form" was added to [[Rotation (music)|rotation]] on Australian youth broadcaster [[Triple J]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2 June 2020|title=Alfie Templeman is a music making machine|url=https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/good-nights/alfietempleman/12313292|access-date=13 October 2020|website=triple j|language=en-AU}}</ref> Templeman's 2020 single "Forever Isn't Long Enough" was released on 28 September 2020, and launched with a third consecutive [[Annie Mac]]'s [[Annie Mac (radio show)|Hottest Record in the World]] on [[BBC Radio 1]]. Templeman singles "Happiness in Liquid Form" and "Obvious Guy" both earned a space on the [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] C List.

In an interview with [https://headlinermagazine.net/emerging-headliner/alfie-templeman-forever-isnt-long-enough.html Headliner Magazine] in 2021, Templeman said of his single "Everybody’s Gonna Love Somebody": “I'm just doing it in my room; I’m a normal bloke just making a bit of a tune. It's literally just been me messing around, really; I'm not a professional at it at all. I just know how to piece it together enough to make it not sound like a bunch of noise!"

In November 2020, he was shortlisted as a finalist for MTV Push UK & IRE 2021 for best upcoming artists.<ref>[http://www.mtv.co.uk/mtv-push-uk-ire-2021/news/meet-our-mtv-push-uk-ire-2021-shortlist MTV UK: Meet our MTV PUSH UK & IRE 2021 shortlist]</ref>

==Notes==
:{{note|epnote|a}} All releases prior to ''Orange Juice'' were removed from streaming platforms at an unknown date, presumably shortly before or after its release. However, these EPs were subsequently re-uploaded to [[Bandcamp]] in 2020, and therefore they are regarded as official releases.
