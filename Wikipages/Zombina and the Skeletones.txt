'''Zombina and the Skeletones''' are a [[horror punk]] band from [[Liverpool]], England, formed in 1998 around the nucleus of vocalist Zombina and songwriter Doc Horror.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zombina and the Skeletones|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/245215-Zombina-and-the-Skeletones|website=[[Discogs]]|access-date=11 December 2016}}</ref><ref name="IM">{{cite web|last1=Rivera|first1=Alberto|title=Unearthing Zombina and the Skeletones|url=http://indiemusic.co/2011/12/24/unearthing-zombina-and-the-skeletones/|website=Indiemusic.co|access-date=11 December 2016}}</ref> {{As of|2021}}, their last recording was a self-released [[Extended play|EP]] in 2017, and their official website is [http://www.zombina.com/ dismantled]. 

Their musical style is pop-oriented, with elements of [[Garage punk (fusion genre)|garage punk]], [[doo-wop]] and [[hard rock]]. Due to their apparent obsession with [[B-movie]]s and [[black humour]], their fanbase extends to the [[gothic rock]], [[deathrock]] and [[psychobilly]] scenes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Horror Punk Inspiration: Zombina and the Skeletones|url=http://www.rebelcircus.com/blog/horror-punk-inspiration-zombina-skeletones/|website=Rebelcircus.com|access-date=11 December 2016|archive-date=20 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220104202/http://www.rebelcircus.com/blog/horror-punk-inspiration-zombina-skeletones/|url-status=dead}}</ref> The majority of their lyrical content deals with themes of [[Horror fiction|horror]] and [[science fiction]].

== History ==
=== Formation ===
Zombina met Doc Horror at [[Calderstones School]] in 1998. They started a band called The Deformed, producing a demo tape "No Sleep 'Til Transylvania", in early 1999.<ref name="IM"/> This tape featured songs that would later be featured on Zombina and the Skeletones albums: "The Grave... And Beyond!", "Braindead" and "Leave My Brain Alone". Since the early years of their formation, the band established a strong B-Movie informed horror theme recalling the early efforts of [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]] and [[The Cramps]].<ref name="IM"/>

=== Career ===
