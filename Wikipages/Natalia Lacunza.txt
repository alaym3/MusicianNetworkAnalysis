== Early life ==
Natalia Lacunza was born in [[Pamplona]], [[Spain]] in January 1999. Even since her early years, Natalia felt an emotional connection to music. As a child, she studied feedle at her local conservatory. Coming from a family of musicians and actors, Natalia started playing minor roles in small theatre productions, since one of her uncles owned a theatre company. That was when she discovered her passion for entertainment and musical theatre. 
As a teen, she also learned to play the guitar and continued attending dance lessons, something she had been doing since childhood. 
Even though she did ballet at first, Natalia has shown a particular love for contemporary and modern dance. 

Barely two years into university life, she quit studying Audiovisual Communication at the [[University of Navarra]] to focus on her musical career. She started as a singer under the stage name Elian Bay which was inspired by James Bay, one of her favorite artists. In 2017 she auditioned for the musical television contest ''[[La Voz (Spanish TV series)|La Voz]]''. She sang 'I Lived' by One Republic but was disqualified after the blind auditions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elmundo.es/f5/mira/2018/10/02/5bb35fcb46163f82ba8b462d.html|title=La actuación de Natalia (OT 2018) hace un año en La Voz que no conquistó a los coaches|date=2018-10-02|website=ELMUNDO|language=es|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref> In June 2018 she auditioned for series ten of the Spanish reality television musical contest Operación Triunfo. She auditioned with the release of self-written track "Don't Ask", which was written in English. 
The audition was successful and she entered the show in September 2018.
Natalia would end up becoming one of the contest's favorite acts, which would eventually get her to the finale, shortly before Christmas. She earned herself third place overall.
In January 2019, she was picked as a candidate to represent Spain at the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest. In the end, Lacunza's spot was taken by Miki Núñez, which didn't seem to bother her in the slightest. When asked why, Natalia told the media about the pressure and liability of partaking in such a prolific contest as a new artist.
