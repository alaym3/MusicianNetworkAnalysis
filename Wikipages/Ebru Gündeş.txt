'''Ebru Gündeş''' ({{IPA-tr|ebˈɾu ɟynˈdeʃ}}, born 12 October 1974) is a Turkish pop-folk singer, actress, and television personality.

==Early life==
Ebru Gündeş was born in [[Istanbul]]. She attended primary school in [[Ankara]], but she was forced to discontinue her education due to financial difficulty. She comes from a prominent religious Sunni Muslim family known for its military leaders.

The quality of her voice was discovered at an early age when one of her relatives took her to Neşe Demirkat, a partner in Raks Neşe Müzik, which is a record label in [[Turkey]]. Demirkat was impressed with her voice and introduced her to music producers Koral Sarıtaş and [[Selçuk Tekay]].

==Career==
Ebru Gündeş sings the kind of desperately tragic [[Arabesque (Turkish music)|Arabesque]] love songs that are the core of [[Turkish pop music]].

Her debut album, ''Tanrı Misafiri'', was released in 1992. It proved to be a massive success, selling 1,250,000 copies nationwide. At this stage, she was regarded as a very sweet and innocent-looking girl, slim, dressed in white and with an attractive habit of raising one eyebrow. She was on billboards all over [[Istanbul]]. Her subsequent albums have been hugely successful.

Gündeş released her fifth studio album ''Sen Allah'ın Bir Lütfusun'' in 1998. On 5 April 1998, the album ranked among the top 10 on [[MÜ-YAP]]'{{'}}s list of 50 best-selling albums,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://gazetearsivi.milliyet.com.tr/Ara.aspx?&ilkTar=05.04.1998&sonTar=05.04.1998&ekYayin=&drpSayfaNo=&araKelime=alb%C3%BCm&gelismisKelimeAynen=Ebru%20G%C3%BCnde%C5%9F&gelismisKelimeHerhangi=&gelismisKelimeYakin=&gelismisKelimeHaric=&Siralama=tarih%20asc&SayfaAdet=20&isAdv=true | title = Zirvedeki 10 albüm | publisher = [[Milliyet]] | date = 5 April 1998 | accessdate = 24 August 2014 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120553/http://gazetearsivi.milliyet.com.tr/Ara.aspx?&ilkTar=05.04.1998&sonTar=05.04.1998&ekYayin=&drpSayfaNo=&araKelime=alb%C3%BCm&gelismisKelimeAynen=Ebru%20G%C3%BCnde%C5%9F&gelismisKelimeHerhangi=&gelismisKelimeYakin=&gelismisKelimeHaric=&Siralama=tarih%20asc&SayfaAdet=20&isAdv=true | archivedate = 26 August 2014 | url-status = live }}</ref> and on 25 April and 2 May it rose to the second position on the list of pop albums sold by Megavizyon and Mephisto music markets.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://gazetearsivi.milliyet.com.tr/Ara.aspx?&ilkTar=25.04.1998&sonTar=05.05.1998&ekYayin=&drpSayfaNo=&araKelime=Megavizyon&gelismisKelimeAynen=ebru%20g%C3%BCnde%C5%9F&gelismisKelimeHerhangi=&gelismisKelimeYakin=&gelismisKelimeHaric=&Siralama=tarih%20asc&SayfaAdet=20&isAdv=true | title = Çok satanlar | publisher = [[Milliyet]] | date = 2 May 1998 | accessdate = 24 August 2014 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160307110602/http://gazetearsivi.milliyet.com.tr/Ara.aspx?&ilkTar=25.04.1998&sonTar=05.05.1998&ekYayin=&drpSayfaNo=&araKelime=Megavizyon&gelismisKelimeAynen=ebru%20g%C3%BCnde%C5%9F&gelismisKelimeHerhangi=&gelismisKelimeYakin=&gelismisKelimeHaric=&Siralama=tarih%20asc&SayfaAdet=20&isAdv=true | archivedate = 7 March 2016 | url-status = live }}</ref> For the album's first music video, Gündeş was accompanied by the Nigerian footballer and [[Fenerbahçe S.K.

She suffered from a cerebral haemorrhage in December 1999, while recording ''[[Dön Ne Olur]]''. After two operations, Ebru eventually returned to full health. ''Dön Ne Olur'' was one of the best-selling albums of all time in Turkey. In November 2001, she released the album ''[[Ahdım Olsun]]''. It was followed by ''[[Şahane]]'' (2003), ''Bize de Bu Yakışır'' (2004), ''Kaçak'' (2006) and ''Evet'' (2008).

Ebru Gündeş then released another album, ''Beyaz'' ("White"). The album, like most albums released that year, was unsuccessful, selling just over 100,000 throughout the year. In 2012, she released the album ''13.5'', which consisted only of covers of old popular songs. The album reached average sales in the country. However, the general perception of music critics had been one of disappointment, as the album consisted solely of covers and was therefore considered to be 'repetition'. In October 2014, her fourteenth studio album, ''Araftayım'', was released. The album sold more than 100,000 copies.

Gündeş's fifteenth studio album ''Âşık'' was released by Blue Music on 31 January 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/ebru-gundes-in-yeni-albumune--asik--olduk-mu--molatik-10859/|title=Ebru Gündeş'in yeni albümüne 'Aşık' olduk mu?|newspaper=Milliyet|first=Mayk|last=Şişman|date=1 February 2019|accessdate=2 July 2019}}</ref> According to the data provided by [[Apple Music]], it became the best-selling and most-downloaded album in Turkey on its day of release. The song "Aşık" also broke the record of the most downloaded song on its day of publication in Turkey.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ntv.com.tr/sanat/ebru-gundesten-iki-rekor-applemusic-verileri,umYbSeg7UU6aiH-CitYuVw|title=Ebru Gündeş'ten iki rekor (AppleMusic verileri)|publisher=NTV|date=25 February 2019|accessdate=2 July 2019}}</ref> Three separate music videos were release for the songs "Âşık", "Gidiniz" and "Çabuk Unutma".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/kelebek/keyif/4-ayda-3-klip-41229090|title=4 ayda 3. klip|newspaper=Hürriyet Daily News|date=29 May 2019|accessdate=2 July 2019}}</ref>

===Television career===
Ebru Gündeş has made hundreds of television appearances in Turkey as a singer and as an actress in the comedy series ''İmkansız Aşk'' (Impossible Love). She was also the host of ''Mega Show'', which was one of the most popular television shows in Turkey. Every week Ebru was joined by a variety of other Turkish singers, most notably her long-time friends [[Serdar Ortaç]] and [[İbrahim Tatlıses]]. The show featured Ebru singing her own songs, singing classic songs and singing duets with other singers. She then appeared in the hugely popular singing contest ''[[Popstar Alaturka]]'' as a judge alongside some of Turkey's most popular singers, namely [[Bülent Ersoy]] and [[Orhan Gencebay]] and TV presenter [[Armağan Çağlayan]]. Just before leaving ''Popstar Alaturka'', she released the album ''Evet'' (''Yes'').

In 2010, Gündeş who was presenting a television program on [[TGRT]] at the time, repeatedly performed a song based on verses from [[Ataol Behramoğlu]]'s poem ''Yaşadıklarımdan öğrendiğim bir şey var'', without asking permission or paying for the copyright. Behramoğlu later filed a lawsuit against Gündeş, the program's producer and broadcaster for violating his rights, asking for compensation due to material and moral damages.<ref>[http://hurarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/goster/ShowNew.aspx?id=-218072/ Ebru Gündeş'e şiir davası] ''Hürriyet Daily News''. Retrieved 23 July 2010.</ref>

She was also a judge on ''[[O Ses Türkiye]]'' (Turkish version of ''[[The Voice (franchise)|The Voice]]'') between 2013 and 2016.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.milliyet.com.tr/gundes-o-ses-turkiye-den-ayrildi-magazin-2306740/| title = Gündeş ‘O Ses Türkiye’den ayrıldı| work = [[Milliyet]] | accessdate = 6 September 2016 | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20170526122929/http://www.milliyet.com.tr/gundes-o-ses-turkiye-den-ayrildi-magazin-2306740/| archivedate = 26 May 2017}}</ref>

==Personal life==
At the age of 16 Gündeş married her first husband Hamdi Vardar. The couple later divorced, and in 2002 she married the lawyer Ömer Durak. Her third marriage was to [[Iranian Azerbaijani]] businessman [[Reza Zarrab]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite web | title = Ebru Gündeş gizlice evlendi | url = http://www.milliyet.com.tr/ebru-gundes-gizlice-evlendi/magazin/magazindetay/11.02.2010/1197531/default.htm | publisher = milliyet.com.tr | accessdate = 9 May 2016 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160514121349/http://www.milliyet.com.tr/ebru-gundes-gizlice-evlendi/magazin/magazindetay/11.02.2010/1197531/default.htm | archivedate = 14 May 2016 | url-status = live }}</ref> They have one daughter.<ref>{{cite web | title = Ebru Gündeş anne oldu | url = http://www.haberturk.com/magazin/herkes-bunu-konusuyor/haber/679606-ebru-gundes-anne-oldu | publisher = haberturk.com | accessdate = 9 May 2016 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160514121353/http://www.haberturk.com/magazin/herkes-bunu-konusuyor/haber/679606-ebru-gundes-anne-oldu | archivedate = 14 May 2016 | url-status = live }}</ref> Reza Zarrab was arrested on 17 December 2013 by Istanbul police in light of [[2013 corruption scandal in Turkey|a corruption scandal]], which involved some members of the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]] being accused of giving bribes totaling 63 million dollars to government ministers or their proxies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/25412674.asp |title=2 Bakan oğlu ile Reza Zarrab tutuklandı |work=Hürriyet Daily News |accessdate=23 March 2014}}</ref> Ebru Gündeş reportedly filed for divorce in September 2016,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/son-dakika-haberi-ebru-gundes-ile-reza-zarrab-bosaniyor-40230898|title=Ebru Gündeş'ten 'boşanma' için ilk açıklama|language=Turkish|work=Hürriyet Daily News|date=25 September 2016|accessdate=8 September 2017}}</ref> but they reconciled shortly afterwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/bosanma-davasinda-surpriz-gelisme-40314705|title=Reza Zarrab ile Ebru Gündeş'in boşanma davasında sürpriz gelişme|language=Turkish|work=Hürriyet Daily News|date=4 August 2017|accessdate=8 September 2017}}</ref> In April 2021, Gündeş again filed for divorce.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/ebru-gundes-ile-reza-zarrabin-bosanma-davasina-yayin-yasagi-1828721|title=Ebru Gündeş ile Reza Zarrab'ın boşanma davasına yayın yasağı|work=[[Cumhuriyet]]|date=16 April 2021|accessdate=20 April 2021}}</ref> Their divorce was finalized on 7 May 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazetevatan.com/unlu-sarkici-ebru-gundes-ile-reza-zarrab-in-11-yillik-evliligi-re-1389411-magazin-galeri-haber/|title=Ünlü şarkıcı Ebru Gündeş ile Reza Zarrab'ın 11 yıllık evliliği resmen sona erdi|work=Vatan|date=7 May 2021|accessdate=7 May 2021}}</ref>
