'''Placebo''' are an English rock band, formed in London in 1994 by vocalist–guitarist [[Brian Molko]] and bassist–guitarist [[Stefan Olsdal]]. Drummer [[Robert Schultzberg]] joined in late 1994, but left in 1996 shortly after the release of the band's [[Placebo (album)|eponymous debut album]] due to conflicts with Molko, and was replaced the same year by [[Steve Hewitt]].

Following the release of a demo, a split single, and [[Placebo (album)|their eponymous debut album]], Placebo gained exposure in 1997 after the single "[[Nancy Boy]]" became popular in the UK, a song notorious at the time for its [[Gender bender|gender-bending]] content. The band stood out amongst the [[Britpop]] scene they were associated with at the time for their [[Androgyny|androgynous]] appearance and musical content,<ref name="Trouser Press">{{cite web |url=http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=placebo |title=TrouserPress.com :: Placebo |last=Neugebauer |first=Delvin |website=[[Trouser Press|TrouserPress.com]] |access-date=4 July 2016}}</ref> and lyrics which openly discussed sexuality, mental health, and drug use.

Hewitt left Placebo in 2007, due to personal and musical differences. He was replaced the following year by [[Steve Forrest (musician)|Steve Forrest]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://popspoken.com/music/2013/08/part-time-dj-part-time-tattoo-model-full-time-drummer-for-placebo| title = Be Infected by Steve Forrest's Optimism | website = [[Popspoken]].com | date = 29 August 2013 }}</ref> Placebo released two albums with Forrest, who left in 2015 to pursue his own musical career. Since 2015, Placebo perform as a duo with four additional live musicians on stage.

Placebo have collaborated with various artists over the years, including [[David Bowie]], [[Justin Warfield]], [[Michael Stipe]] and [[Alison Mosshart]]. To date, Placebo have released seven studio albums, all of which have reached the Top&nbsp;20 in the United Kingdom, and have sold around 11&nbsp;million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jimdunlop.com/artist/placebo |title=Dunlop Manufacturing :: Artists :: Placebo |work=[[Dunlop Manufacturing|Dunlop]] |access-date=5 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322023810/http://www.jimdunlop.com/artist/placebo |archive-date=22 March 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==History==
===Formation (1994–1995)===
Placebo founders [[Brian Molko]] and [[Stefan Olsdal]] had both attended the [[International School of Luxembourg|American International School of Luxembourg]], without speaking to each other, as they were part of different social circles.<ref name="sallystraton">{{cite web|last=Straton|first=Sally|url=http://www.placeboworld.co.uk/archive/sstrat.htm|title=PLACEBO in conversation with Sally Stratton August 1998|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929031237/http://www.placeboworld.co.uk/archive/sstrat.htm|archive-date=29 September 2006|access-date=9 July 2017|url-status=dead}} Note: copy stored at Placebo Official Website.</ref> The two met by chance in 1994, in London, England. At the time, Olsdal was taking guitar lessons and was on his way home when he met Molko at the [[South Kensington tube station]]. Molko, observing that Olsdal had a guitar strapped to his back, invited Olsdal to watch him perform at a local gig.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bryant |first=Miranda| url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/placebo-we-met-by-chance-at-the-tube-10058864.html |title=Placebo: We met by chance at the Tube8 |work=Evening Standard|access-date=9 July 2017|date=20 February 2015}}</ref> On the strength of Molko's performance, Olsdal decided that they should start a band. The two formed as Ashtray Heart,<ref name="You R Here">{{cite web |url=http://yourhereblog.mtv.com/2007/08/18/girls-gone-punk-placebo-the-sex-and-the-drugs-and-the-complications/ |title=New Music Videos, Reality TV Shows, Celebrity News, Pop Culture |date=18 August 2007 |work=You R Here |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202070634/http://yourhereblog.mtv.com/2007/08/18/girls-gone-punk-placebo-the-sex-and-the-drugs-and-the-complications/ |archive-date=2 December 2008 |access-date=26 June 2013}}</ref> named after the [[Captain Beefheart]] song of the same name.<ref name="Trouser Press"/> Molko, however, denied in 2009 that Ashtray Heart was the first name of the band, dismissing this as a rumour and claiming that the band had more names initially.<ref name= "adelaidenow">{{cite web |url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/placebos-battle-to-find-a-new-identity/news-story/4778d2555706020546878fc35c9f9e0c |title=Placebo's battle to find a new identity |date=3 June 2009 |work=The Advertiser|location=Adelaide|access-date=9 July 2017}}</ref>

Originally, the two were unable to decide on a drummer. They played for a while with [[Steve Hewitt]], a friend of Molko,<ref name= "sallystraton"/> but Hewitt had prior commitments to local band Breed.<ref name= "drummerszone">{{cite web | url=http://www.drummerszone.com/artists/artist.php?artistNR=054f2a879887475224348b55fb8d23dd&bioLimit=all |title=Steve Hewitt |work= drummerszone.com| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314054132/http://www.drummerszone.com/artists/artist.php?artistNR=054f2a879887475224348b55fb8d23dd&bioLimit=all |archive-date=14 March 2012 |access-date=9 July 2017}}</ref> [[Robert Schultzberg]] assumed the position of drummer in late 1994.<ref name=Thompson>{{cite book |author=Dave Thompson  |author-link=Dave Thompson (author) |year=2006 |title=Hallo Spaceboy: The Rebirth of David Bowie |publisher=[[ECW Press]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k0l_cQEHV5oC&pg=PA159 |isbn=1550227335}}</ref>

The band eventually chose the name Placebo, due to its meaning in Latin, "I shall please".<ref name="pleasureprincipal">{{cite web |url=http://www.placeboworld.co.uk/archive/princ.htm |title=THE PLEASURE PRINCIPAL |work=[[Melody Maker]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.

<blockquote>It's a complex question to answer, really. As musicians you try to find a name for your band that represents you and you never really do, because, basically, names for bands lose their meaning after a while. They become a series of sounds that you associate with people in music. The most important thing for a name is that you can imagine forty-thousand people screaming it in unison.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lxop360sc0 | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211103/0Lxop360sc0| archive-date=2021-11-03 | url-status=live|title=Placebo (Brian Molko) Interview 2000 – YouTube |via=YouTube |access-date=26 June 2013}}{{cbignore}}</ref></blockquote>

===Debut album, line-up change and glam connection (1996–1998)===
In October 1995 the band released "[[Bruise Pristine]]", a split single with the band Soup, on Fierce Panda.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/release/1576915|publisher=Discogs|title=Placebo / Soup (25) – Bruise Pristine / M.E.L.T.D.O.W.N.}}</ref> Molko would later speak in negative terms about this release.<ref name="mmakerready">{{cite web |url=http://www.placeboworld.co.uk/archive/spook.htm |title=READY, STEADY, SPOOK |work=[[Melody Maker]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.

By 1996 Placebo were signed with [[Caroline Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/placebo-mn0000355412/biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|author=Greg Prato|title=Placebo Biography by Greg Prato}}</ref> Their debut album, the self-titled ''[[Placebo (album)|Placebo]]'', was released on 17 July 1996.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Reece |first=Doug |date=14 September 1996 |title=Popular Uprisings |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |page=28 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wQkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA28}}</ref> The album was produced by Brad Wood and was influenced, according to Molko, by [[Sonic Youth]] and [[Depeche Mode]].<ref name= "noiseyvice">{{cite web |last=Lindsay |first=Cam|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/article/3bkk98/rank-your-records-brian-molko-skeptically-rates-placebos-eight-lps |title=Rank Your Records: Brian Molko Skeptically Rates Placebo's Eight LPs |work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |access-date=9 July 2017|date=14 October 2016}}</ref> The release peaked at No.&nbsp;5 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] at the height of the [[Britpop]] era; their highest-charting album in the country to date.<ref name="UK charts">{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/placebo/ |title=Placebo |work=[[Official Charts Company|Official Charts]] |access-date=26 June 2013}}</ref> When reviewing a concert, ''[[the New York Times]]'' compared them to bands of the "first wave of post-punk rock, particularly [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[the Cure]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], early [[U2]] and [[Talking Heads]]".<ref>{{cite web|first=Jon |last=Pareles |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/30/arts/in-performance-pop-568120.html |title=A Terse Outsider Enumerates His Woes Placebo The Cooler |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=30 September 1996 |access-date=10 June 2013}}</ref>

Tension with Schultzberg and the rest of the group had begun to rise in the previous year. The band initially fired him in September 1995, but he was rehired to record the first seven-inch single "Bruise Pristine". After an argument in August 1996, Molko decided that it would be best for the band if Schultzberg left. The band came to an agreement that Schultzberg would leave once they had finished the promotion of ''Placebo''.<ref name="Placebo City">{{cite web |url=http://www.placebocity.com/forum/sujet-6802-exclusive-interview-of-robert-schultzberg |title=Exclusive: Interview of Robert Schultzberg! / Forum Placebo City |date=18 November 2007 |work=Placebo City |access-date=26 June 2013}}</ref>

Eventually, Schultzberg did indeed leave the band in September 1996, on a United States tour. Before going on stage for their first show in the state of New York, Olsdal informed Schultzberg that he wasn't going on the tour in Germany that was following the US one. At the manager's request, Schultzberg did two more shows with the band in Paris after the US tour, the last of which was a performance on the French TV show ''Nulle part ailleurs''. According to Schultzberg "Molko said that he was 'tired of being the focus of Robert's rages against the world', and quite frankly, I was tired of being his".<ref name="Placebo City"/> While Schultzberg was with the band, several early works were recorded, including their first 7" single "Bruise Pristine", the "[[Come Home (Placebo song)|Come Home]]" EP, the single version of "Nancy Boy" (with B-sides "[[Slackerbitch]]", "Miss Moneypenny" and the [[The Smiths|Smiths]] cover "Bigmouth Strikes Again") and their eponymous debut album. On the track "I Know", Schultzberg played [[didgeridoo]] as well as drums.

Steve Hewitt, who had played with the band in 1994, joined Placebo as a full-time member at Molko's request.<ref name="drummerszone" />

The most successful song on the debut album was "[[Nancy Boy]]", which peaked at number 4 in the UK Singles Chart upon its release in 1997.<ref name="everyhit">{{cite web |url=http://everyhit.com/ |title=Search Results – Singles|work=everyhit.com|access-date=9 July 2017}}</ref> The song had been written in 1994, being partially inspired by an infamous quote of [[Suede (band)|Suede]]'s [[Brett Anderson]]: "I'm a [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] man who's never had a homosexual experience."<ref name= "teamrock">{{cite web |last=Hughes |first=Rob|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2016-12-07/the-story-behind-nancy-boy-placebo-interview|title=The Story Behind The Song: Nancy Boy by Placebo |work=teamrock.com|date=7 December 2016 |access-date=9 July 2017}}</ref> Its lyrics were full of sexual allusions, and Molko admitted at the time: "It's not absurd.

The song attracted the attention of [[David Bowie]],<ref name= "teamrock"/> who invited the band to open several of his concerts in early 1996.<ref>{{cite web |last=Milliken |first=Alice|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/04/21/placebo-footage-david-bowie/|title=Rare David Bowie video shows the star saying: 'I am never going to die' |work=[[PinkNews]]|date=21 April 2017 |access-date=9 July 2017}}</ref> In the following January, Bowie invited them to play at his 50th birthday celebrations at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]].<ref name="Prato">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/placebo-mn0000355412 |title=Placebo – Music Biography, Credits and Discography : AllMusic |last=Prato |first=Greg |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=26 June 2013}}</ref> The party also included [[Billy Corgan]] of [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] of [[The Cure]] and [[Lou Reed]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://76.12.46.30/bowie.htm |title=David Bowie at the Garden with Special Guests (NY Rock) |last=Young |first=Cook |date=1 September 1997 |website=76.12.46.30|access-date=9 July 2017}}</ref>

The band's [[glam rock]] connections continued. In 1998, Placebo recorded a cover of [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]]'s "[[20th Century Boy]]" for the ''[[Velvet Goldmine]]'' soundtrack and the band appeared in minor roles in the film.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120879/fullcredits#cast |title=Full cast and crew for ''Velvet Goldmine''|publisher=[[IMDb]] |access-date=9 July 2017}}</ref> Bowie made a special appearance on-stage with Placebo during a tour stop in New York as part of the band's late February tour with [[Stabbing Westward]].<ref name="NYC Bowie">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1426395/david-bowie-joins-placebo-onstage-nyc-show.jhtml |title=David Bowie Joins Placebo Onstage for NYC Show |date=1 April 1999 |publisher=[[MTV News]] |access-date=26 June 2013}}</ref> Placebo played "20th Century Boy" live with David Bowie at the [[BRIT Awards]] show in 1999.<ref name="NYC Bowie"/>

Placebo were heavily criticised by the media due to their unorthodox attitude and Brian Molko's androgynous appearance.<ref name= "independent">{{cite web |last=Meadley |first=Phil|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/placebo-accept-no-substitute-545316.html|title=Placebo: Accept no substitute |work=[[The Independent]]|date=24 October 2004 |access-date=9 July 2017}}</ref> In a 2016 interview related to their early years, Molko commented:
<blockquote>
We were reacting very strongly against the machismo, terrace chants and revisionism of Britpop, and the [[nationalism]] that we interpreted as [[xenophobia]] of the musical kind. We were trying to make a strong political statement about the fluidity of [[sexuality]] with the dresses and make-up that we wore. We set out to confuse, and I guess ''Nancy Boy'' was the perfect soundtrack to that.<ref name= "teamrock"/>

The last single on the album, "[[Without You I'm Nothing (song)|Without You I'm Nothing]]" was re-recorded and released as a duet with David Bowie, at Bowie's request.

The album created additional UK top&nbsp;20 hits in "[[Taste in Men]]" and "Slave to the Wage", which reached number 16 and 19 in the UK Singles Chart, respectively.<ref name="everyhitsingles"/>

In a 2001 interview, Molko declared:
<blockquote>
I think it's the album we always wanted to make. I think without exaggerating even the tiniest bit, we love it and we've never been so happy with an album. Our debut was fast and rough, punk pop, ''Without You I'm Nothing'' showed our melancholy, depressed side and ''Black Market'' shows a perfect combination of both sides.<ref name= "nyrock"/>
</blockquote>

The singer would later become more reserved towards ''Black Market Music'', describing it in 2016 as "real somber", and expressing the regret of not having been involved enough during the production phase.<ref name= "noiseyvice"/>

Placebo encountered resistance from the British music industry upon release of the single "[[Special K (song)|Special K]]" due to its reference of a [[ketamine]] high as a simile for love.

Placebo released their fourth album, produced by Jim Abbiss<ref name = "Billboard review">{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/71681/sleeping-with-ghosts|title=Sleeping With Ghosts |date=12 April 2003 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=9 July 2017}}</ref> and named ''[[Sleeping with Ghosts]]'', on 24 March 2003.<ref name= "discography"/> The sound of the album was described in a ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' review as being infused with "edgy electronic flourishes".<ref name = "Billboard review"/>

Molko explained the title of an album in an interview:
<blockquote>
It is romantic without being sentimental. It's an album full of colour. It's also the first time when we recorded an album during the summer, after a long break. Before, we were in a sort of rock'n'roll bubble, we were alternating the studio sessions and the live concerts, we were pretty much cut off from the real world. It's dangerous to live too much in this kind of bubble. We had the chance to distance ourselves a bit from everything that happened since 1996 up until now. I also had the occasion to reflect to the montagne russe that is my personal life after these seven years. The ghosts I'm talking about are the people, the events you're wearing into your soul consciously or not.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.placebocity.com/article-placebo-64-interview-l-effet-placebo.html |title=L'effet Placebo ! |work=Studyrama |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081114175419/https://www.placebocity.com/article-placebo-64-interview-l-effet-placebo.html |archive-date=14 November 2008 |access-date=9 July 2017}} Note: copy stored at Placebo City</ref>

[[File:Steve_hewitt_love_amongst_ruin_backstage.jpg|right|thumb|Former drummer Steve Hewitt left the band in 2008 due to personal and musical differences.]]

The relationship between Steve Hewitt and the rest of the band had become tense during the recording of ''Meds''<ref name = "noiseyvice"/> and eventually, in October 2007, the band announced that Hewitt was no longer in Placebo. Molko commented that "Being in a band is very much like being in a marriage, and in couples—in this case a triple—people can grow apart over the years. To say that you don't love your partner anymore is inaccurate, considering all that you've been through and achieved together. There simply comes a point when you realise that you want different things from your relationship and that you can no longer live under the same roof, so to speak".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.placeboworld.co.uk/mynews.php?id=412 |title=Placebo / News |date=1 October 2007 |work=placeboworld.co.uk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224180247/http://www.placeboworld.co.uk/mynews.php?id=412 |archive-date=24 December 2011 |access-date=26 June 2013}}</ref> Olsdal commented "We couldn't go on with Steve Hewitt. We didn't have the same goals, nor the same vision anymore. We had to separate. It all went wrong during the ''Meds'' tour. [...] There was no communication between us.

Lyrically, Placebo's music contains many references to [[recreational drug use|drugs]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.voicemag.uk/feature/who-did-it-better-placebo-or-lou-reed |title=Who did it better: Placebo or Lou Reed |last=Taylor |first=Luke |date=2 February 2016 |work=Voice Magazine |access-date=9 July 2017}}</ref> and [[LGBT culture|LGBT themes]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/538xpq/brian-molko-placebo-queerness-90s-nancy-boy-20-years |title=20 Years After "Nancy Boy": How Brian Molko Queered Up the 90s |last=Jones |first=Daisy|date=7 April 2017 |work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |access-date=9 July 2017}}</ref> The title of the song "Special K", for instance, is slang for [[ketamine]]. Molko has been open about his use of recreational drugs: in a 1997 interview with ''[[Kerrang!]]'' magazine he admitted that heroin was "probably the only drug on this planet I haven't tried".<ref>{{cite journal |date=18 January 1997 |title=New York Doll |journal=[[Kerrang!]] |url=http://placeboworld.co.uk/archive/doll.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080130153315/http://placeboworld.co.uk/archive/doll.htm |archive-date=30 January 2008 |access-date=26 February 2012}}</ref> However, he later admitted to using heroin as well.<ref name="handling">{{cite web |url=http://www.placeboworld.co.uk/archive/selpussy.htm |title=I Thought I Was Good At Handling Pussy |work=[[Select (magazine)|Select]] |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324003724/http://www.placeboworld.co.uk/archive/selpussy.htm |archive-date=24 March 2008 |access-date=9 July 2017 |url-status=dead  }} Note: copy stored at Placebo Official Website.</ref> Pharmaceutical drugs are also referenced, as evidenced by the band's name as well as the album ''Meds'' and its title track. Molko admitted in 2003 that many of his initial excesses were due to his mental issues; he was officially diagnosed with [[major depressive disorder]] in his late twenties.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/06/12/1055220707026.html |title=The drugs don't work |work=smh.au |date=13 June 2003 |access-date=9 July 2017}}</ref> The singer claimed in 2016 that he gave up drugs completely after the recording and release of ''Meds''.<ref name= "noiseyvice"/>

Outsider themes are also explored, as evidenced in lyrics such as "the back of the class is where I'm from" on "One of a Kind" and "I'm forever black-eyed/A product of a broken home" on "Black-Eyed". Molko has been quoted as calling the band "for outsiders, by outsiders".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theo2.co.uk/indigo2/view-event.html?eventId=2132 |title=Placebo Tickets |work=[[The O2]] |access-date=4 July 2013}}</ref>
