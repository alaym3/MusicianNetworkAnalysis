'''Vektor''' is an American [[thrash metal]] band from [[Tempe, Arizona]] (and based in [[Philadelphia]] since 2012). Their music is heavily themed around scientific, philosophical, futuristic and astronomical topics.

== History ==

=== Formation and first albums (2002–2011) ===
The band was formed under the name Locrian in December 2002 by the front man/guitarist David DiSanto, but changed their name to Vektor a year later and released their first demo, "Nucleus". Vektor became popular in the Phoenix metal scene, with a musical style that mixes progressive metal and technical thrash metal, with high-pitched screaming vocals. In 2006, Vektor released a demo entitled "Demolition", followed by a two track demo "Hunger for Violence" (2007). After four years of local and regional performances as the opening act for such national acts as [[Testament (band)|Testament]], [[Hirax]], [[Iced Earth]] and [[Municipal Waste (band)|Municipal Waste]], Vektor embarked on a tour, alongside label mates Exmortus, in support of Black Future in December 2009 through January 2010. The band subsequently toured the US in June–August 2010 on their own. Their first full-length album, ''[[Black Future]]'', was released on November 17, 2009, on Heavy Artillery Records.<ref name="Vektor: 'Black Future' Release Date Announced">{{cite web|title=Vektor: 'Black Future' Release Date Announced|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/vektor-black-future-release-date-announced/|website=Blabbermouth.net|date=September 18, 2009|publisher=Blabbermouth|access-date=March 13, 2016}}</ref> The band released its second album, ''[[Outer Isolation]]'', on November 22, 2011, on the Heavy Artillery label.<ref name="Vektor – Outer Isolation">{{cite web|title=Vektor – Outer Isolation (CD, Album) at Discogs|url=https://www.discogs.com/Vektor-Outer-Isolation/release/3390492|website=Discogs.com|publisher=Discogs|access-date=March 13, 2016}}</ref> In 2012, the band signed with [[Earache Records]] after the label acquired Heavy Artillery's roster of artists.

=== Touring, ''Terminal Redux'', and hiatus (2012–2016) ===

In the summer of 2012 Vektor went on a small headlining tour, and in November opened on an extended tour with [[Napalm Death]], [[Municipal Waste (band)|Municipal Waste]] and [[Exhumed (band)|Exhumed]]. In January 2013, the band played the Earache Records Showcase in California.

The band played their first European show at [[Hellfest (French music festival)|Hellfest]] in June 2013. They embarked on their first full European headlining tour in November and December 2015 alongside [[Angelus Apatrida]] and Distillator which included an appearance at Eindhoven Metal Meeting and culminated in a show at the Camden Underworld in London.<ref name="Vektor reveal new album title and announce debut European Tour">{{cite web|title=Vektor reveal new album title and announce debut European Tour|url=http://www.loudnoise.nl/vektor-reveal-new-album-title-and-announce-debut-european-tour/|website=loudnoise.nl|publisher=Loud Noise|access-date=March 13, 2016}}</ref> In early 2016, the band embarked on an American tour opening for [[Voivod (band)|Voivod]].
