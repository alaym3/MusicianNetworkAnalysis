The Norwegian vocalist [[Roy Khan]] joined for the album ''[[Siége Perilous]]'', and shared songwriting credit with Youngblood until his departure in April 2011. On June 22, 2012, Youngblood announced on their website that their new vocalist would be the Swedish singer [[Tommy Karevik]], who was first featured on Kamelot's album ''[[Silverthorn (album)|Silverthorn]]'' as the main vocalist, co-songwriter, and lyricist.

==History==

===Early years, ''Eternity'', ''Dominion'' and ''Siége Perilous'' (1987–1998)===

The band was formed back in 1987, in Florida, by guitarist [[Thomas Youngblood]], with Richard Warner on drums, Rob Beck on vocals and Dirk Van Tilborg on bass and keyboards, as "Camelot". This name was originally suggested by Youngblood's mother, since she loved [[John F. Kennedy]].<ref name="portfolio">{{cite web|url=https://sylrmartin.com/portfolio/interviewing-thomas-youngblood-kamelot/|title=Interviewing Thomas Youngblood (KAMELOT)|date=June 2, 2015|access-date=June 2, 2015}}</ref> In 1988, they recorded the song "Breaking The Silence", composed by Youngblood and Warner, for "Tampa Bay's Metal Mercenaries: The Invasion", a cassette-only compilation of various Heavy Metal bands from Tampa Bay, produced by Keith "Thumper" Collins (ex-bassist for [[Savatage]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thecorroseum.org/comps/tampabaysmetalmercenaries.html|title=Tampa Bay's Metal Mercenaries: The Invasion}}</ref>

In 1991, Sean Tibbetts (then using the stage name Sean Christians) joined as bass guitarist, Rob Beck was replaced on vocals by Mark Vanderbilt and Dirk Van Tilborg left the band.<ref name="bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.tartareandesire.com/bands/Kamelot/879/|title=Kamelot Bio|date=December 4, 2009|access-date=19 March 2010}}</ref> They changed its name into "Kamelot" because there was a local record store named Camelot and to set it apart from the whole Camelot tales.<ref name="interview">{{cite web|url=https://thegreatsouthernbrainfart.com/?p=10303|title=Blowin' Wind with Kamelot's Thomas Youngblood: ""It doesn't matter who sings for Kamelot.

One year later, Glenn Barry replaced Sean Christians on bass guitar and, on the following year, the band recorded its second demo. After this, David Pavlicko was recruited as keyboardist and, on the next year, the band signed a deal with [[Noise Records (Germany)|Noise Records]] and released its first album, ''[[Eternity (Kamelot album)|Eternity]]'', in 1995. The next album, ''[[Dominion (Kamelot album)|Dominion]]'', was released in 1997. Later that year, founder Richard Warner departed the band and drummer Casey Grillo was brought in. In 1998, the singer Mark Vanderbilt was unable to tour and [[Roy Khan]] (of [[Conception (band)|Conception]]) was picked up as the new lead vocalist.<ref name="bio"/><ref>{{Cite web|title = KAMELOT's Thomas Youngblood|url = http://www.metal-rules.com/metalnews/2005/08/24/kamelots-thomas-youngblood/|access-date = 2015-06-18|date = January 29, 2000|website = metal-rules.com}}</ref> When Roy Khan was selected, he had to prove himself by skydiving with the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metalcrypt.com/pages/interviews.php?intid=198|title=Kamelot Interview|publisher=The Metal Crypt|date=July 30, 2007|access-date=February 9, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalstorm.net/bands/trivia.php?band_id=136&bandname=Kamelot|title=Kamelot - Trivia|publisher=Metal Storm|access-date=February 9, 2020}}</ref> With these two new members, Kamelot released its third studio album, ''[[Siége Perilous]]''.

In mid-2000, Kamelot undertook the "New Allegiance Tour" through Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Greece and Spain, during which the recordings for Kamelot's first live album ''[[The Expedition]]'' were made. A few months later, the band released its fifth album, ''[[Karma (Kamelot album)|Karma]]''. The sixth album, ''[[Epica (Kamelot album)|Epica]]'', was released in 2003. Both ''Epica'' and the band's seventh album, ''[[The Black Halo]]'', which was released in 2005, are based on [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s version of the legend of ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Kamelot: The Black Halo|date=August 2005|access-date=November 11, 2013|first=Harley |last=Carlson|work=Last Rites|url=http://lastrit.es/reviews/1831/kamelot-the-black-halo|quote=Continuing as well as greatly broadening the Faustus themed concept first introduced on 2003’s Epica, its successor The Black Halo offers an even deeper and darker glimpse into an already complex and introspective storyline.}}</ref> a man who sells his soul to the devil. To support the new album, the band toured through Europe (with [[At Vance]] as a supporting band) and Japan.

In a June 2020 interview with the "Jones.Show", Youngblood revealed that he, Karevik and Palotai have been working on new material for the upcoming thirteenth Kamelot album: 
{{quote|We have material for the new album right now that we're working on. And everything is fresh, but it still has this signature sound that we want to have and we feel is important. That's the trick for an artist — you've gotta make sure you give fans what they expect, but you don't want to give them the same thing, because then you're not growing and it's just gonna be boring. But we have been able to do that.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/thomas-youngblood-on-next-kamelot-album-everything-is-fresh-but-it-still-has-this-signature-sound/|title=THOMAS YOUNGBLOOD On Next KAMELOT Album: 'Everything Is Fresh, But It Still Has This Signature Sound'|work=Blabbermouth|date=June 2, 2020|access-date=June 2, 2020}}</ref>}}
