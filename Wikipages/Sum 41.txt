On May 10, 2006, [[Dave Baksh]] announced in a statement through his management company that he was leaving Sum 41 to work with his new band, [[Brown Brigade]], which has a more "classic metal" sound.

Recording of the band's fourth studio album, ''[[Underclass Hero (album)|Underclass Hero]]'', began on November 8, 2006, and finished on March 14, 2007. On April 17, 2007, the band released a song on [[iTunes]], "[[March of the Dogs]]". Although not a single, the band released it early because, according to Whibley, "the record [wouldn't] be out until the summer". Whibley was threatened with deportation for the song, because he metaphorically "killed the [[George W. Bush|president]]" on it.<ref>{{cite web|title=Whibley Threatened With Deportation|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news/whibley-threatened-with-deportation_1038245|work=Contactmusic|access-date=November 18, 2012|date=July 22, 2007}}</ref>

In a November 2004 interview, Deryck Whibley said: "We don't even consider ourselves punk. We're just a rock band. We want to do something different. We want to do our own thing. That's how music has always been to us."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.concertlivewire.com/interviews/deryck.htm |work=Concert Livewire |title=Deryck Whibley of Sum 41 Interview - One on One |last=Bonyata |first=Phil |date=November 25, 2004 |access-date=October 3, 2018}}</ref> Dave Baksh reiterated Whibley's claims, stating "We just call ourselves rock... It's easier to say than punk, especially around all these fuckin' kids that think they know what punk is.
