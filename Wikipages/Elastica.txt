'''Elastica''' were a British [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[London]] in 1992 that were influenced by [[punk rock]], [[post-punk]] and [[new wave music]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/elastica-p44835 |title=Elastica > Biography |access-date=2 February 2012 |author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> Their 1995 album ''[[Elastica (album)|Elastica]]'' produced singles that charted in the United Kingdom and United States, including its highest-charting US Hot 100 hit, "[[Connection (Elastica song)|Connection]]." The band broke up in 2001, about a year after releasing their second LP.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/elastica-reunite-return-studio-1956368 |title=Elastica reunite and return to the studio |work=nme.com |author=Damien Jones |date=23 Jan 2017}}</ref> The band's members changed several times; [[Justine Frischmann]] and [[Justin Welch]] were the only members who remained from beginning to end.

==History==
In mid-1992, ex-[[Suede (band)|Suede]] band members Justine Frischmann and Justin Welch decided to form a group. By autumn of that year, bassist [[Annie Holland]] and guitarist [[Donna Matthews]] were added. After initially gigging under names such as "Onk," they settled on the name "Elastica" in October 1992. They released their first single, "[[Stutter (Elastica song)|Stutter]]," in October 1993, which benefited from the promotional efforts of [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ and [[Deceptive Records]] label boss [[Steve Lamacq]], who discovered the band earlier that year. In 1994, they released two UK [[Top 40|Top 20]] singles, "[[Line Up (song)|Line Up]]" and "[[Connection (Elastica song)|Connection]]", and performed on numerous [[radio station|radio]] shows. Frischmann's relationship with [[Blur (band)|Blur]] frontman [[Damon Albarn]] made [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] headlines.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book |first=Martin C. |last=Strong |title=The Great Rock Discography |publisher=Mojo Books |location=Edinburgh |edition=5th |year=2000 |pages=312–313 |isbn=1-84195-017-3}}</ref>

Elastica's first LP, ''[[Elastica (album)|Elastica]]'', was released in March 1995, and entered the [[UK Albums Chart]] at No.&nbsp;1;<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> it became the fastest-selling debut album since [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]' ''[[Definitely Maybe]]''.<ref name="Stylus"/> This record was held for over ten years, until it was surpassed by the [[Arctic Monkeys]]' debut ''[[Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not]]'' in 2006.<ref>{{cite news |title=Stuff events - Arctic Monkeys |url=http://events.stuff.co.nz/artist/arctic-monkeys |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |access-date=2 January 2017}}</ref> The album was preceded by their fourth single "[[Waking Up (song)|Waking Up]]" which went to No.&nbsp;13 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], their highest placing therein.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

The band became subject to controversy when several bands sued them for [[plagiarism]]. Specifically, the [[art punk]] band [[Wire (band)|Wire]] (whom Elastica counted as one of their main influences) claimed that many of the band's melodies were taken from Wire compositions, as well as by [[the Stranglers]]. Notably, Wire's "I Am the Fly" has a chorus similar to Elastica's "Line Up" and the intro synthesizer part in Elastica's "Connection" (later also repeated on guitar) is lifted from the guitar riff in Wire's "Three Girl Rhumba" and transposed a semitone, and the Stranglers also passed comment that Elastica's "Waking Up" bore a marked resemblance to their song [[No More Heroes (The Stranglers song)|"No More Heroes"]]. The disputes were resolved by out-of-court settlements.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/><ref name="Stylus">{{cite web |url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/artist_profile/elastica.htm |title=Artist Profile Elastica |last=Bloch |first=Sam |work=[[Stylus Magazine]] |date=1 September 2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626021851/http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/artist_profile/elastica.htm |archive-date=26 June 2012}}</ref>

The mid-90s witnessed another "British Invasion" in America. "Stutter" and "Connection" received airplay on [[modern rock]] radio and both charted on the [[Billboard Hot 100]], peaking at nos 67 and 53 respectively; their debut album also charted and was later certified [[music recording sales certification|gold]]). After performing at the 1995 [[Glastonbury Festival]], the band joined the [[Lollapalooza]] tour continuing an almost solid year of constant gigs where they toured North America four times.<ref name="Stylus"/> Citing exhaustion, Annie Holland quit the band in early August 1995 and was replaced for the remainder of the tour by session bassist [[Abby Travis]]. Holland was not permanently replaced until the arrival of Sheila Chipperfield in the spring of 1996. Around this time, keyboardist David Bush (ex-[[The Fall (band)|the Fall]]) was added to the line-up.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

After playing more shows and demoing new material in the first half of 1996, Elastica entered the studio in the later part of the year to begin work on their second album. By late 1998 Matthews had left the band. She was replaced by guitarist Paul Jones (of the band [[Linoleum (band)|Linoleum]]) and keyboardist Mew. Around this time, Chipperfield was replaced by the returning Annie Holland.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

As a tribute to the "lost years" of the band, a self-titled six-track EP appeared in August 1999, collecting a variety of recordings from a multitude of aborted sessions. This EP marked the first new material from the band in over four years. After re-recording most of these songs in mid-1999, along with new compositions, the band played their first set of shows in years. Their second proper album, ''[[The Menace (album)|The Menace]]'', was released in April 2000. After the release of the farewell single "The Bitch Don't Work" in 2001, the band announced their amicable break-up.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

===After the break-up===
In 2005, Frischmann emigrated to Boulder, [[Colorado]], and studied art at [[Naropa University]]. She had begun working as an artist by 2008, and later moved to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].<ref>{{cite news |title=On my radar: Justine Frischmann's cultural highlights |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/may/07/on-my-radar-justine-frischmann-cultural-highlights-eliott-smith-wendy-white-bernie-sanders |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=23 January 2019 |date=7 May 2017}}</ref> Matthews is a pastor in [[Totnes]], and according to a recent{{when|date=August 2020}} [[BBC 6]] show has been linked romantically to [[Lawrence Chandler]] of [[Bowery Electric]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Holland lives in [[Brighton]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Welch and Mew are married, and live in [[Hastings]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Welch played drums for [[Lush (band)|Lush]]'s 2015-16 reunion shows and now plays in Piroshka, https://bellaunion.com/artists/piroshka/, releasing two albums on Bella Union. <ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Bonner |first1=Michael |title=Lush announce first live show for almost twenty years |url=https://www.uncut.co.uk/news/lush-announce-first-live-show-for-almost-twenty-years-70941 |magazine=Uncut |access-date=23 January 2019 |date=28 September 2015}}</ref> Jones is the [[A&R]] man at Rough Trade joining after managing his Slogan label, which released the Fall's ''[[Fall Heads Roll]]''.

On 21 January 2017, the band's official Facebook page posted photos featuring three-quarters of the original line-up – Matthews, Holland and Welch – during a visit to Abbey Road Studios in London. They were working on a remaster of their debut ''Elastica'' with Mastering engineer Sean McGee. Frischmann also worked on the remaster.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Marotta |first1=Michael |title='They hadn't seen each other for 20yrs': Elastica are back in the studio |url=http://www.vanyaland.com/2017/01/21/they-hadnt-seen-each-other-for-20yrs-elastica-are-back-in-the-studio |publisher=Vanyaland |access-date=23 January 2019 |date=21 January 2017}}</ref> The record was reissued in April on [[Record Store Day]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Trendell |first1=Andrew |title=Elastica respond to reunion rumours |url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/elastica-respond-reunion-rumours-2020045 |magazine=NME |access-date=23 January 2019 |date=17 March 2017}}</ref>
