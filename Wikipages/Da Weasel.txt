'''Da Weasel''' are a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[hip hop music|hip hop]]/[[rock music|rock]] band from [[Almada]] (a suburb of [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]]), fronted by [[MC]]s Pacman (now known as Carlão)<ref>http://lyricstranslate.com/es/carl%C3%A3o-lyrics.html</ref> and Virgul. They are one of the oldest hip-hop projects in Portugal, having been formed in 1993 and terminated in 2010, and notorious for being a full session band, instead of relying on a DJ and samples. The band announced their reunion in 2019.<ref>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz3rdYeB04P/</ref> Their music uses elements from [[hard rock]], [[pop music|pop]] and [[ska]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.songaah.com/singer/da-weasel.html|title=Da Weasel|website= SongAah}}</ref>
==Career==

Da Weasel's first release was the [[extended play|EP]] ''More Than 30 Motherfuckers'', featuring only six songs, all in English. The group featured Pacman as the MC, Pedro Quaresma, Jay Jay Neige, Guilherme Silva and João Fagulha on live instruments, Yen Sung as backup vocalist and [[Armando Teixeira (musician)|Armando Teixeira]] as DJ and producer. The following year, in 1994, the band rode the wave of the ''Rapública'' [[compilation album|compilation]], which presented Portuguese hip-hop to the mainstream audience, by releasing their first full album, ''Dou-lhe Com A Alma''. This time, the band wrote all the songs in Portuguese, incorporating influences derived from [[Cypress Hill]] and [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]].

Before production of their third release (''3º Capítulo'') in 1997, Yen Sung left the band to start a career as an [[acid jazz]] producer, as well as DJing. She was replaced by Virgul, a rapper/singer which introduced a few ragga and afro elements to the band's sound, as was seen in the singles "Todagente" and "Duia", with Virgul imposing his personality without outshining main MC Pacman. Da Weasel also went on tour for the first time.

In 1999, after taking part in [[Mario Caldato Jr.]]'s ''[[Tejo Beat]]'' compilation and the [[Xutos & Pontapés]] tribute album ''XX Anos - XX Bandas'', Da Weasel went back to the studio to record their fourth album, ''Iniciação A Uma Vida Banal - O Manual''. The critically acclaimed album was the band's first silver record, and helped increase their previous release sales enough to grant them a second silver. Da Weasel also served as a opening act to [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]' concert at the [[Atlantic Pavilion]] in [[Lisbon]].

Armando Teixeira then left the band to pursue a solo career, and experienced pop-rock producer Mário Barreiros helmed the recording of ''Podes Fugir Mas Não Te Podes Esconder'' in 2001. Da Weasel's work now blended influences from hip-hop, heavy metal, reggae and African music to produce a unique sound that was still undeniably Portuguese. Paris-based Cuban hip-hop trio [[Orishas (band)|Orishas]] was featured on the album. ''Podes Fugir...'' soon rose up to gold and later platinum record sales.

In 2004, Mário Barreiros was replaced by João Martins as producer, and DJ Glue joined the band as live DJ, filling a spot vacant for three years. They helped Da Weasel reinvent themselves on their latest album, ''Re-Definições'', a deeply thought-out piece of work which refined the sound heard in the previous album. Music fans responded enthusiastically, with over 80,000 copies sold, making it Da Weasel's best selling album.

In 2005 the band played a sold-out concert at the [[Paris Olympia|Olympia]] in [[Paris]], its first ever big international performance.

In 2006 Da Weasel publishes a Track named "Play Up" inspired by the statement of [[Bob Marley]]: "Football is Music" which expresses their passion for [[Association football|football]]. The track is found exclusively on the CD ''PlayUp'', among 15 other football tracks written by various artists.

On April 2, 2007, Da Weasel released their latest album entitled ''Amor, Escárnio e Maldizer''. It reached platinum status on the same day, with over 20,000 copies sold.

The band sang a song called ''[[Nigga]]'' on [[Gato Fedorento]]'s last episode of the season ''Diz Que É Uma Espécie de Magazine''. They were before presented with a Gato Fedorento's audio sketch, "Nigga, Tu És Nigga, Nigga?" ("Nigga, Are You Nigga, Nigga?"), and they quoted part of the sketch.

On December 9, 2010, Da Weasel announced the band's breakup.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tvi24.iol.pt/musica/nos-alive/da-weasel-regressam-aos-palcos-em-2020|title=DA WEASEL REGRESSAM AOS PALCOS EM 2020|website=TVI24}}</ref>

In July 13, 2019, It was announced that Da Weasel will be reuniting for an exclusive concert on July 11, 2020 in the [[NOS Alive]] festival in Portugal.<ref>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz3rdYeB04P/</ref> The reunion has been postponed to 10 July 2021 after the cancellation of the 2020 edition of the festival, due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal|COVID-19 pandemic]].
