'''Anthony L. Ray''' (born August 12, 1963), better known by his stage name '''Sir Mix-a-Lot''', is an American [[rapper]], songwriter, and record producer. He is best known for his 1992 hit song "[[Baby Got Back]]", which peaked at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

==Early life==
Anthony Ray was born on August 12, 1963, in [[Auburn, Washington]], a suburb of [[Seattle]], and grew up in Seattle's Central District. Growing up, Ray's mother worked as a licensed practical nurse (LPN) at the King County Jail making 6 or 7 dollars an hour. Ray was a fan of [[hip hop]] and started rhyming in the early 1980s.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/sir-mix-a-lot/biography/| title=Sir Mix-a-Lot Biography| access-date=July 13, 2015}}</ref>

While living in the Bryant Manor apartments on 19th Ave and East Yesler Way, Anthony Ray started school at [[Roosevelt High School (Seattle)|Roosevelt High School]], near the University District, when the Seattle Public School District was in the throes of what would be a 21-year experiment to integrate the school system; [[Guns N' Roses]] member [[Duff McKagan]] and actress and [[Charmed]] star [[Rose McGowan]] also went there. Students were bused from their neighborhoods to schools at the other end of the city. From 1978, when the busing program started, to 1999, when it was shelved, minorities carried the burden of busing, piling onto buses from the South End and the Central Area that were headed for predominantly white schools in the North End.<ref name="Busing Blues">{{cite web| url= http://kuow.org/post/busing-blues-when-seattle-sent-black-kids-white-north-end| title=Busing Blues| access-date=January 2, 2018}}</ref>

Ray said he knew that some North End residents didn't want black kids bused into their neighborhoods. But for him, the experience offered respite from the projects. "I’ve heard things like, 'Forced integration is not good,' 'I want my kid to be able to go to school in our community; that’s why we moved here' – all those things I totally understand," he said. "But from my perspective, I didn’t have the luxury of living in a neighborhood where a good school was. We didn’t make that kind of money. So from my perspective, it was the best thing that could have happened to me."<ref name="Busing Blues"/> A music teacher at Eckstein Middle School introduced Ray to the possibility of a music career. Before becoming a rapper, Ray at an early age was interested in electronics and CB radio, one of his early jobs was working at a pinball arcade servicing machines, during that time he also started to fix keyboards and other musical equipment. He still works with electronics as a hobby.<ref>{{cite podcast |host=Bomani Jones|title=Sir Mix-A-Lot|website=ESPN|publisher=ESPN Radio|date=19 August 2018|time=12:24 |url=http://www.espn.com/espnradio/play/_/id/23862570 |access-date=19 August 2018}}</ref>

==Career==
===1980s===
Early on, Sir Mix-A-Lot had an ear and a passion for music.  Soon after high school he began DJing parties at local community centers.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=50163| title=Going Way Back A Brief History of 206 Hiphop| access-date=January 2, 2018}}</ref>  By 1983 Mix-A-Lot had begun playing weekends regularly at the Rainier Vista Boys and Girls Club in South Seattle. Soon he moved locations and started throwing his parties at the Rotary Boys and Girls Club in the Central District.  It was there that he met 'Nasty' Nes Rodriguez, a local radio DJ and host of Fresh Tracks, the West Coast's first rap radio show on Seattle station KKFX (KFOX).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.blackpast.org/aaw/sir-mix-lot-ray-anthony-1963| title=Sir Mix-A-Lot / Ray, Anthony| access-date=January 2, 2018}}</ref>

Sir Mix-a-Lot partnered with Nasty Nes and local businessman Ed Locke to found the Nastymix record label in 1983.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blecha |first1=Peter |title=Nastymix Records' party marks Gold Record awarded to Sir Mix-A-Lot's SWASS album on April 29, 1989 |url=https://www.historylink.org/File/9793 |website=www.historylink.org |access-date=1 April 2019}}</ref> The first song to gain popularity outside of Seattle was "Square Dance Rap" in 1986. Mix-a-Lot had originally decided to rap the entire song slow, then speed and pitch it up in post production, Mix later told Seattle Refined in 2018 that "I didn't want to rap, that's why I use this weird Smurf voice".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Karlinsky |first1=Malia |title=Rapping with the King of Old School: Seattle's own Sir Mix-A-Lot |url=http://seattlerefined.com/lifestyle/rapping-with-the-king-of-old-school-aka-seattles-sir-mix-a-lot |website=Seattle Refined |publisher=Sinclair Broadcast Group |access-date=1 April 2019 |date=20 September 2018}}</ref> After the song was picked up by DJs in clubs nationwide, he went touring in Florida, New York, and other states. While in Arizona, he noticed a street named Broadway with a restaurant named Dick's, just like Seattle. This gave him the idea to write his next hit "Posse on Broadway".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Weingarten |first1=Christopher R. |title=Best of '88: How Sir-Mix-A-Lot's 'Posse on Broadway' Put Seattle on Rap's Map |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/best-of-88-sir-mix-a-lot-posse-on-broadway-751314/ |website=Rolling Stone |access-date=1 April 2019 |date=6 November 2018}}</ref>

Mix-a-Lot's next hit, released in 1987, was the single "[[Posse on Broadway]],"  whose title referred to [[Broadway (Seattle)|Broadway]] in Seattle's [[Capitol Hill, Seattle, Washington|Capitol Hill]] district.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|last=Huey|first=Steve|title=Sir Mix-A-Lot – Biography|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p96|pure_url=yes}}|website=[[AllMusic]]|year=2003|access-date=2015-03-27}}</ref> The song made the Top 100 but quickly disappeared, although it remains popular in the Seattle area for its references to many local landmarks.
