==Notes==
There has been at least one significant [[remix]] of "Rude". A remix by Russian-German producer/DJ [[Zedd (musician)|Zedd]] was premiered in his set at [[Lollapalooza]] 2014. It was released on 2 September 2014, Zedd's 25th birthday. Zedd had said, "I'm gonna give myself a birthday present and release my remix of "Rude" on my bday, sept 2nd!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enjoygram.com/m/795123997754020954_28855276|title=@zedd – I'm gonna give myself a birthday present and... – EnjoyGram}}</ref> He also released official, completed full-length audio on his Soundcloud on 28 August 2014, which garnered nearly 400,000 plays within 24 hours. While the original was still in number-one position on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], there was speculation that release of the remix on [[mainstream]] music outlets online would assist the original song in maintaining its position on the chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edmnations.com/zedd-remix-of-magics-rude-turns-the-sleepy-song-into-a-fist-pumping-dance-anthem-listen/|title=ZEDD REMIX OF MAGIC!'S "RUDE" TURNS THE SLEEPY SONG INTO A FIST-PUMPING DANCE ANTHEM — LISTEN|work=EDM Nations|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903123603/http://edmnations.com/zedd-remix-of-magics-rude-turns-the-sleepy-song-into-a-fist-pumping-dance-anthem-listen/|archive-date=2014-09-03}}</ref>
