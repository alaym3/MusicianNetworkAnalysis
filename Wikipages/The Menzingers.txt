'''The Menzingers''' are an American [[punk rock]] band from [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], United States, formed in 2006. The band consists of Greg Barnett (vocals, guitar), Tom May (vocals, guitar), Eric Keen (bass) and Joe Godino (drums). To date, the band has released seven studio albums, with their most recent, ''From Exile,'' released on September 25, 2020.

==History==
The Menzingers formed in the wake of Scranton [[ska-punk]]/[[pop punk]] bands Bob and the Sagets (featuring Tom May, Joe Godino, Eric Keen, and non-Menzingers members Lee Hartney & Curtis Irie, currently of Irie Idea) and Kos Mos (featuring Greg Barnett, Adam Mcilwee of [[Tigers Jaw]] and [[Wicca Phase Springs Eternal]], and Leo Vergnetti of [[Captain, We're Sinking]]). Their first release was a self-titled demo tape made in 2006, which made its way onto many top ten lists of that year.<ref>{{cite web |title=About the Menzingers |url=http://www.punknews.org/bands/themenzingers|website=Punknews.org |date=2009-05-16 |access-date=2009-05-16 }}</ref>

Their debut full length, "[[A Lesson in the Abuse of Information Technology]]" (released on [[Go-Kart Records]]), was produced by [[Jesse Cannon]]. According to Cannon, "I record bands every day and almost all of them are missing something. The Menzingers have it all — the songs, the aggression, the heart, and the passion that most only dream of."

In 2009, the band released a four-song EP titled "Hold On Dodge" through [[Red Scare Industries]], their first vinyl release (including a 600-run olive edition).<ref>{{cite web |title=The Menzingers: Episode 1 |url=http://notpopular.com/2009/03/16/the-menzingers-episode-1/|website=Notpopular.com |date=2009-03-16 |access-date=2009-05-16 }}</ref> A bonus track for the EP titled "Kentucky Gentleman" is available through [[iTunes]].

Early in 2010, the band did a brief stint with [[Anti-Flag]]. April 13 saw the release of their second full length, ''[[Chamberlain Waits]]'', through Red Scare Records. In March and April they also toured in support of [[Against Me!]].

On May 17, 2011, they announced that they had signed to [[Epitaph Records]]. [[Brett Gurewitz]], founder of Epitaph Records and guitarist of [[Bad Religion]] said this about the signing of the band: <br/>
"These guys play the kind of pure punk rock that I grew up with. They are seriously talented songwriters and I'm happy to welcome them to the Epitaph family. I think the band is a great fit here."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/42660 |title=Exclusive: The Menzingers join Epitaph |website=Punknews.org |date=2011-05-17 |access-date=2017-03-06}}</ref>

They released ''[[On the Impossible Past]]'' on February 20, 2012, and it was met with critical acclaim. A music video was shot and released for the song "Nice Things."

''On the Impossible Past'' went on to be voted "Album Of The Year" 2012 for both Absolutepunk.net and Punknews.org. It was also voted "Album Of The Year" by ''RockZone'' magazine in Spain.

The Menzingers released a split 7" EP with [[The Bouncing Souls]] in November 2013. Both bands released a new original song on the split, along with a cover of one of the other band's songs. The Menzingers covered "Kate is Great" from ''[[The Bouncing Souls (album)|The Bouncing Souls]]'', and The Bouncing Souls covered "Burn After Writing" from ''On the Impossible Past''.

On November 29, 2013, while performing at the [[Bowery Ballroom]], Greg Barnett said that the band had just come out of the studio. The new album, ''[[Rented World]]'', was released on April 22, 2014. A music video for a song from the new album, "In Remission", was released on February 18, 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/the-menzingers-in-remission-song-rented-world-stream |title=Check Out the First Song from the Menzingers' New Album, 'Rented World' |first=Dan |last=Ozzi |website=Noisey.vice.ocom |access-date=2014-02-18}}</ref>
