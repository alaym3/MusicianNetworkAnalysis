'''Front Line Assembly''' ('''FLA''') is a Canadian [[electro-industrial]] band formed by [[Bill Leeb]] in [[1986 in music|1986]] after leaving [[Skinny Puppy]]. FLA has developed its own sound incorporating elements of [[electronic body music]] (EBM) and [[electro-industrial]]. The band's membership has rotated through the years, including Michael Balch, [[Rhys Fulber]], and [[Chris Peterson (producer)|Chris Peterson]], all of whom are associated with several other acts.

Since their inception, the group have produced over a dozen studio albums and EPs, several of which have charted on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s Top Dance/Electronic Album chart. The albums ''[[Tactical Neural Implant]]'' and ''[[Hard Wired]]'' are two of the group's most successful records, the former being considered a classic among industrial music fans. They have also produced soundtracks for video games such as ''[[Quake III: Team Arena]]'' (a collaboration with [[Sonic Mayhem]]) and ''[[AirMech]]''.

Over the years, the band's name has sometimes been published as "Front Line Assembly" and sometimes as "Frontline Assembly". The former spelling is the most common, and the band's members have stated that the version with three separate words is preferred.<ref name="sonicenvelopefulberinterview2">{{cite web | url=http://www.sonicenvelope.com/interviews/fulber2.html | title=More "Stuff" Than "Dat" – an interview with Rhys Fulber of Front Line Assembly | publisher=Sonic Envelope Magazine | last=Blink | first=Anastasia | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030926015307/http://www.sonicenvelope.com/interviews/fulber2.html | archive-date=September 26, 2003 | access-date=July 21, 2014}}</ref>

==History==

===Formation (1985–1986)===
Between 1985 and 1986, Bill Leeb performed with [[Skinny Puppy]] under the name Wilhelm Schroeder, a combination of his first name and the name of the [[Schroeder (Peanuts)|Peanuts character]] and was meant as a joke.<ref name="eklectiqueinterview">{{cite web | url=http://www.darkwaver.com/eklectique/two/frontline.html | title=Front Line Assembly | publisher=Eklectique Magazine | last=Porter | first=Alicia | date=November 8, 1998 | access-date=July 13, 2014}}</ref> Leeb had no musical training, and learned to play synthesizer while contributing [[bass synth]] and backing vocals for the band.<ref name="barcodeinterviewkey">{{cite web |url=http://www.barcodezine.com/Cevin%20Key%20Interview.htm |title=cEvin Key interview |date=2003 |publisher=Barcode |access-date=August 7, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407055306/http://www.barcodezine.com/Cevin%20Key%20Interview.htm |archive-date=April 7, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="phoenixnewtimesinterview">{{cite web |url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2011-06-02/music/front-line-assembly-leads-cyborg-armies-through-post-apocalyptic-soundscapes/full/ |title=Front Line Assembly Leads Cyborg Armies Through Post-Apocalyptic Soundscapes |last=Raven |first=Daniel |date=June 2, 2011 |website=Phoenix New Times | access-date=August 7, 2014}}</ref> He also supported their 1985 tour.<ref name="joeradiointerview1988">{{cite web | url=http://www.darkdb.com/eklein/intervw/fla1.html | title=Interview: Front Line Assembly | last=Radio | first=Joe | date=April 24, 1988 | access-date=March 31, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416174519/http://www.darkdb.com/eklein/intervw/fla1.html | archive-date=April 16, 2014 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Not prepared for another tour, Leeb left Skinny Puppy in early 1986.<ref name="barcodeinterviewkey" />

Having developed some instrumental skills and music industry experience,<ref name="mphistory">{{cite web | url=http://www.mindphaser.com/archive/history/ | title=History | publisher=Mindphaser.com | access-date=March 31, 2014}}</ref> and wanting to do more vocal work,<ref name="mplivelyartsinterview" /> Leeb decided to take the risk of starting his own project.<ref name="phoenixnewtimesinterview" /><ref name="chaoscontrolinterview93">{{cite web | url=http://www.chaoscontrol.com/front-line-assembly-3/ | title=Front Line Assembly | publisher=Chaos Control Magazine | date=1993 | access-date=July 21, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411143127/http://www.chaoscontrol.com/front-line-assembly-3/ | archive-date=April 11, 2012 | url-status=dead }}</ref>  Leeb decided to call the project Front Line Assembly to reflect his belief that strength lies in working together.<ref name="mplivelyartsinterview" />

Leeb started by producing a demo tape, ''[[Nerve War]]'', which was distributed on a limited basis. Contacts in the music scene he had gathered while with Skinny Puppy led to contract offers from the first two labels that Leeb later approached with cassettes.<ref name="chaoscontrolinterview93" />

Around this time, Leeb and Rhys Fulber became friends when they discovered they both had a similar interest in underground music. As an unofficial member at this time, Fulber partnered with Leeb during the production of ''[[Total Terror]]'' and was credited for the song "Black Fluid" on the demo. Both demo releases were limited to 100 and mostly distributed amongst friends.<ref name="joeradiointerview1988" />

===Early releases and Michael Balch (1987–1989)===
The band members were influenced by early electronic and [[industrial music|industrial]] acts such as [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], [[Portion Control (band)|Portion Control]], [[Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft|D.A.F.]], [[Test Dept]], [[SPK (band)|SPK]], and [[Severed Heads]],<ref name="mplivelyartsinterview">{{cite magazine | title=Front Line Assembly | last=Armstrong | first=Emily | magazine=Lively Arts | year=1987 }}</ref> but mainly by the electronic body music style of [[Front 242]].<ref name=Johnson2012>{{cite web |url=https://somethingelsereviews.com/2012/06/01/on-second-thought-front-line-assembly-civilization-2004/ |title=On Second Thought: Front Line Assembly – Civilization (2004) |last=Johnson |first=Tom |date=June 1, 2012 |website=Something Else Reviews |access-date=May 14, 2021}}</ref>

The first appearance of Front Line Assembly was the track "Aggression",<ref name="darkdbcomp">{{cite web |url=http://www.darkdb.com/eklein/comp/compf.html#278 | title=Compilations F |last=Klein |first=Ed |publisher=Ed Klein |access-date=August 7, 2014}}</ref> which was included on the compilation ''For Your Ears Only'', released in 1987 by [[United Kingdom|British]] [[independent record label]] [[Third Mind Records|Third Mind]]<ref name="reclamationbooklet">{{cite AV media notes |title=Front Line Assembly - Reclamation |others=Front Line Assembly |year=1997 |pages=2–3 |publisher=[[Roadrunner Records|Roadrunner]] |last=Levermore |first=Gary |type=booklet |location=[[New York City|New York]]}}</ref> showcasing the label's repertoire at the time. The  track would be re-released the following year on the ''[[Disorder (EP)|Disorder]]'' EP. Although the contact to Third Mind would later develop into a long-standing collaboration, the band debuted its first album ''[[The Initial Command]]'' with credited assistance by Fulber and Michael Balch on [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[independent record label]] KK at the end of 1987. The album had been produced on a tight budget which would determine whether or not cuts would be done with an eight track system or split into two four track cuts.<ref name="interviewaltpress">{{cite interview |last=Leeb |first=Bill |subject-link=Bill Leeb |interviewer=Mike Shea |title=Interview with Bill Leeb |work=[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] |location=Cleveland |year=1988}}</ref> 
With the next album ''[[State of Mind (Front Line Assembly album)|State of Mind]]'', released in January 1988, the band switched to [[Germany|German]] independent label Dossier.<ref name="allmusicstateofmind">{{AllMusic | class=album | id=state-of-mind-mw0000674566 | label=Front Line Assembly: ''State of Mind'' > Overview | access-date=March 31, 2014}}</ref> They changed labels as Leeb did not want to be bound to one label,<ref name="chaoscontrolinterview93" /> so the releases were issued only on European labels.<ref name="joeradiointerview1988" />

In 1988, Balch became an official band member<ref name="joeradiointerview1988" /> and began writing songs alongside Leeb for the next few albums. Balch mostly contributed by providing keyboards and programming.<ref name="mphistory" /> This partnership produced the releases ''[[Corrosion (Front Line Assembly album)|Corrosion]]'' and ''Disorder''. A planned release on the [[Canada|Canadian]] label [[Nettwerk]] fell through,<ref name="interviewaltpress"/> and the two finished masters were issued instead by Third Mind in 1988.<ref name="convulseinterviewlevermore">{{cite web | url=http://obsolete.com/convulsion/interviews/convulse/2.11.html |title=Third Mind Records |last=Bains |first=Jon |publisher=Convulse |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990505072734/http://www.obsolete.com/convulsion/interviews/convulse/2.11.html |archive-date=May 5, 1999 |access-date=August 7, 2014}}</ref> Through Levermore ''Corrosion'' was licensed to [[Wax Trax! Records|Wax Trax!]]. Both records were re-released together with three more unreleased tracks on the [[Compilation album|compilations]] ''[[Convergence (Front Line Assembly album)|Convergence]]'' later that year and ''[[Corroded Disorder]]'' in 1995.

Adhering to Third Mind for Europe and Wax Trax! for North America resulted in better availability of the albums in both places,<ref name="joeradiointerview1988" /> and the signing with Third Mind attracted the attention of established music magazines, including ''[[Melody Maker]]''<ref name="melodymakerrevcorrosion">{{cite magazine | last=Stubbs | first=David | date=February 20, 1988 | title=Front Line Assembly - Corrosion | magazine=[[Melody Maker]] | publisher=[[IPC Media]] | location=London }}</ref><ref name="melodymakerrevdisorder">{{cite magazine | last=Stubbs | first=David | date=May 28, 1988 | title=Front Line Assembly - Disorder | magazine=[[Melody Maker]] | publisher=[[IPC Media]] }}</ref><ref name="melodymakerrevconvergence">{{cite magazine | author=The Stud Brothers | title=Front Line Assembly - Convergence CD | magazine=[[Melody Maker]] | publisher=[[IPC Media]] | location=London}}</ref><ref name="melodymakerrevgashed">{{cite magazine | last=Smith | first=Mat | title=Front Line Assembly - Gashed Senses & Crossfire | magazine=[[Melody Maker]] | publisher=[[IPC Media]] | location=London}}</ref> or ''[[NME]]''<ref name="nmerev">{{cite magazine | last=Lamacq | first=Steve | date=May 7, 1988 | title=Front Line Assembly - Corrosion | magazine=[[NME]] | publisher=[[IPC Media]] | location=London}}</ref> as well as the underground magazine ''Music From the Empty Quarter''.<ref name="emptyquarterrev">{{cite magazine | author=Deadhead | title=Front Line Assembly - Convergence | magazine=Music From the Empty Quarter}}</ref>

Front Line Assembly produced their next album ''[[Gashed Senses & Crossfire]]'' in 1989.  This album introduced their first single ''[[Digital Tension Dementia]]'' which became their first chart success and peaked at position 45 of the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] chart.<ref name="billboarddtd">{{cite web |url={{BillboardURLbyName |artist=Front Line Assembly |chart=Dance/Club Play Songs}} |title=Front Line Assembly Album & Song Chart History |work=Billboard |access-date=August 7, 2014}}</ref>  In support of their latest release, the band, together with Fulber as live metal percussionist, headed out to Europe and North America for their first tour.  However, during the show in London in July 1989 their first live album ''[[Live (Front Line Assembly album)|Live]]'' was recorded under unfavourable circumstances. Presumably not well attended, the audience's reactions at the show had to be reworked.<ref name="reedassimilate3">{{cite book | last=Reed | first=S.

===Rhys Fulber and growing popularity (1990–1999)===

Accompanied by the release of two singles in 1990, "Iceolate" and "Provision", the album raised Front Line Assembly's profile in the industrial music scene and in the media considerably.<ref name="chaoscontrolinterview93" /><ref name="reclamationbooklet" /> [[Melody Maker]] elected both album singles ''Single of the week''<ref name="reedassimilate3"/> while the promotional video for "Iceolate"<ref name="coma101songs">{{cite web |url=http://coma-online.com/feature-101-greatest-industrial-songs-101-81/ |title=101 Greatest Industrial Songs of All Time' |last=Schock |first=David |publisher=COMA |date=March 9, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821162902/http://coma-online.com/feature-101-greatest-industrial-songs-101-81/ |archive-date=August 21, 2014 |access-date=August 24, 2014}}</ref> received some airplay on [[MTV]].

On ''Caustic Grip'' the band started working with [[Greg Reely]] which would evolve into a long-term partnership.<ref name="reclamationbooklet" /> The tour in support of the album started in January 1991 in the United States<ref name="convulseinterviewfla">{{cite web | url=http://www.obsolete.com/convulsion/interviews/convulse/1.2.html |title=Front Line Assembly |last=Barr |first=Stuart |date=May 1991 |publisher=Convulse |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127143602/http://obsolete.com/convulsion/interviews/convulse/1.2.html |archive-date=November 27, 2010 |access-date=August 24, 2014}}</ref> to be followed by a European leg in February which was accompanied by the release of stand-alone single ''Virus'' the same month.<ref name="reclamationbooklet" /> Chris Peterson, who would later become a full-time member of Front Line Assembly, gave his debut for the band on this tour, completing the live line-up as percussionist.

In [[1992 in music|1992]], Front Line Assembly reached a turning point in the band's musical style with the album ''[[Tactical Neural Implant]]''. The media, including ''[[Melody Maker]]'',<ref name="melodymakertnirev">{{cite magazine |author=The Stud Brothers |year=1992 |title=Front Line Assembly - Tactical Neural Implant | magazine=[[Melody Maker]] |location=London}}</ref> Siren Magazine<ref name="sireninterview">{{cite interview |last=Leeb |first=Bill |subject-link=Bill Leeb |interviewer=Ian Cheek |title=Interview |work=Siren |date=April 1992 |issue=9}}</ref> and fanzine Industrial Strength<ref name="industrialstrengthtnirev">{{cite magazine |year=1992 |title=Front Line Assembly: Tactical Neural Implant |magazine=Industrial Strength |location=DeKalb, Illinois |issue=2 |page=27}}</ref> all commented particularly on the more melodious approach featured on the album and noted the use of multi-layered sounds which would become a trademark of the band. Asked about this composing style by [[Industrialnation|Industrial Nation]], Leeb explained that the band continually experimented with new ways to use technology to make each recording different, and had focused on clarity and sustain in their instrumentation and structure in their songs.<ref name="interviewindnation1992">{{cite interview |last=Leeb |first=Bill |subject-link=Bill Leeb |interviewer=Kim Traub |title=Interview |location=Oakland, California |work=[[Industrialnation|Industrial Nation]] |publisher=Paul Valerio |issue=5 |year=1992}}</ref><ref name="interviewWCRD1992">{{cite interview |last=Leeb |first=Bill |subject-link=Bill Leeb |interviewer=Michael Tressler |title=Interview with Bill Leeb of Front Line Assembly Live on WCRD |publisher=CRD |location=Muncie, Indiana |date=March 19, 1992}}</ref>

The next album ''[[Millennium (Front Line Assembly album)|Millennium]]'' ([[1994 in music|1994]])<ref name="allmusicstateofmind" /> featured a combination of [[heavy metal music|metal]] guitars, electronic music, and media sampling (much of which was taken from the [[Michael Douglas]] film ''[[Falling Down]]'') which had become one of the characteristics of [[industrial rock]] and [[industrial metal]] during the 1990s. ''[[Hard Wired]]'' ([[1995 in music|1995]])<ref name="allmusicstateofmind" /> and the [[Concert tour#Concert tour|world tour]] following the release was FLA's most successful commercial and critical period. Leeb has stated he was influenced to pursue this style of music after listening to [[Pantera|Pantera's]] "[[Walk (Pantera song)|Walk]]", which he later incorporated into the single "[[Surface Patterns]]".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Front Line Assembly Interview - June 2011 - COMA Music Magazine|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbHrraQwFec| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/YbHrraQwFec| archive-date=2021-11-17 | url-status=live|access-date=2020-08-10|website=YouTube|language=en}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

In September 1996 the band made a live performance in Vancouver for the [[iHeartRadio MMVAs|MuchMusic Video Awards]] which was broadcast via satellite.<ref name="mmva1996billboardannounce">{{cite magazine |last=LeBlanc |first=Larry |title=MuchMusic To Launch M3 In '97 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |location=New York |publisher=Howard Lander |date=September 14, 1996 |volume=108 |issue=37 |page=47 |issn=0006-2510 |oclc=67058557}}</ref>

In 1997, Fulber left the band to concentrate on producing [[Fear Factory]] with other bands. [[Chris Peterson (producer)|Chris Peterson]], who had already supported the band's live shows, replaced Fulber. Soon after Fulber's  departure, the album ''[[FLAvour of the Weak|&#91;FLA&#93;vour of the Weak]]'' was released. Yet again, the album was stylistically divergent from previous releases. The metal influences found in ''[[Millennium (Front Line Assembly album)|Millennium]]'' gave way to a more [[electronica]] sound within the new release.

Front Line Assembly returned somewhat to their former sound with the album ''[[Implode (album)|Implode]]'' ([[1999 in music|1999]]).  Front Line Assembly composed the soundtrack for the video game, ''[[Quake III Arena|Quake III Team Arena]]''. In October 1999, it was made public that the band had left their label Metropolis.<ref name="sidelinenews19991028">{{cite news | url=http://www.side-line.com/news13.htm | title=Front Line Assembley have left Metropolis | work=Side-Line | date=October 28, 1999 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010709081342/http://www.side-line.com/news13.htm |archive-date=July 9, 2001 | access-date=February 26, 2017}}</ref>

===Success in the new millennium (2000–2011)===

Fulber rejoined the band in [[2003 in music|2003]].  The reunited duo released the single "[[Maniacal (song)|Maniacal]]" in October of that year.

In April 2007, Front Line Assembly released a remix album titled ''[[Fallout (Front Line Assembly album)|Fallout]]''.

In 2010, Front Line Assembly released two new singles, "[[Shifting Through the Lens]]" and "Angriff", and an album, ''[[Improvised Electronic Device]]''; ''I.E.D.'' saw the band embrace a heavier, more guitar-driven sound, much like ''Millenium''.<ref name="popmattersrev">{{cite web |last=Schiller |first=Mike |url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/128553-front-line-assembly-improvised-electronic-device |title=Front Line Assembly: Improvised.

===Back to electronic roots and new influences (2012–present)===
Having integrated guitars into their sound since the late 1980s, either sampled or as live guitars, FLA returned in 2012 to making exclusively electronic music.

== Musical style ==
The band has explored many music genres across their releases, including: Industrial, [[industrial rock]], industrial metal, EBM and electro-industrial.<ref name=Johnson2012/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/front-line-assembly-mn0000660941/biography |title=Front Line Assembly – Biography |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=May 14, 2021}}</ref>

=== Development ===
Although being established as a largely [[Industrial music|industrial]] project, the band is known to take liberty in adapting their sound across many of their releases over the years. The band's early catalogue has been largely described as EBM, industrial and electro-industrial from ''Total Terror'' to ''Gashed Senses and Crossfire''. Rhys Fulber has featured as a prominent collaborator with Leeb across many FLA releases, as both found they have a shared interest in electronic music. Fulber officially replaced longtime member Micheal Balch on ''Caustic Grip'', who was busy with other projects at the time. Fulber has since worked on and off with the band across several releases, he rejoined as a member in 2014.

''Caustic Grip'' (1990) marked a shift to [[industrial rock]] on the single "Provision", featuring guitar work that would later be featured much more extensively on the next several albums. The opening track (''Resist'') also features guitar, which is uncredited and is possibly a sample. ''Tactical Neural Implant'' released soon after in 1992 and marked a major change in the bands sound, exploring more melodic and electronic styles throughout the album. The album was the first to feature widespread use of multiple film and instrumental samples, another element to be expanded on later. The release is considered one of the bands very best by fans and critics alike.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-05-10|title=Rediscover: Front Line Assembly: Tactical Neural Implant|url=https://spectrumculture.com/2016/05/09/rediscover-front-line-assembly-tactical-neural-implant/|access-date=2021-05-13|website=Spectrum Culture|language=en-US}}</ref>

''Millennium'' (1994) then followed and became the band's first industrial metal record, containing several guitar samples from prominent [[Heavy metal music|metal]] bands such as [[Pantera]] ("[[Walk (Pantera song)|Walk]]") alongside the [[Session musician|session]] guitar work of [[Devin Townsend]], who also appears on the follow-up ''Hard Wired'' (1995). The inclusion of guitars has since become common on recent FLA albums, such as ''Improvised Electronic Device'' (2010), though not a permanent change.

[''FLA]vour of the Weak'' (1997) is similar to ''Tactical Neural Implant'', though it has significant electronica and big beat influences and is possibly the band's most melodic and musically varied album in their entire catalogue. The album largely eschews previously used guitars and samples, featuring a more stripped-down sound. ''Flavour''' and the next two releases, ''Implode'' (1999) and ''Epitaph'' (2001), featured Chris Peterson as a collaborator (including future albums) before the return of Fulber on ''Civilization'' (2004). ''Echogenetic'' (2013) saw the band incorporate [[dubstep]] into their music, which was popular at the time.

The band released a [[soundtrack album]] titled ''AirMech'' in 2012, followed by ''WarMech'' in 2018. The albums feature a continuation of the electronica style of the band's later material. The first is the eponymous soundtrack of the game and the latter is for the game's sequel, titled ''AirMech Wastelands.''
