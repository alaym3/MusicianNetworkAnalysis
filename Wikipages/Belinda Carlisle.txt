'''Belinda Jo Carlisle''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɑr|l|aɪ|l}}; born August 17, 1958) is an American musician, singer, and author. She gained fame as the lead singer of [[the Go-Go's]], one of the most successful [[all-female band]]s of all time, and went on to have a prolific career as a solo artist.

Raised in [[Southern California]], Carlisle became the lead singer of the Go-Go's after the band's formation in 1978. With their chart-topping debut release ''[[Beauty and the Beat (The Go-Go's album)|Beauty and the Beat]]'' in 1981, the group helped popularize [[new wave music]] in the United States. The Go-Go's were the first (and to date only) all-female band in history who wrote their own songs and played their own instruments to achieve a No.&nbsp;1 album. The Go-Go's have sold over seven million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/celebs/women/singer_60/93_belinda_carlisle.html|title=Belinda Carlisle Biography|publisher=AskMen.com|access-date=November 27, 2010|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Bghno6Tj?url=http://www.askmen.com/celebs/women/singer_60/93_belinda_carlisle.html|archive-date=October 25, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

After the dissolution of the Go-Go's in 1985, Carlisle went on to have a successful solo career with radio hits such as "[[Mad About You (Belinda Carlisle song)|Mad About You]]", "[[I Get Weak]]", "[[Circle in the Sand]]", "[[Leave a Light On (Belinda Carlisle song)|Leave a Light On]]", and "[[Heaven Is a Place on Earth]]". The Go-Go's reformed in 1999, and Carlisle continues to perform with them regularly while also maintaining her solo career. 

Carlisle's autobiography, ''Lips Unsealed'', published in June 2010, was a [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller]] and received favorable reviews.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/2010/06/02/belinda_carlisle_lips_unsealed/|work=Salon|title="Lips Unsealed": Belinda Carlisle comes clean|author=Eby, Margaret|date=June 2, 2010|access-date=January 26, 2017}}</ref> In 2011, Carlisle, as a member of The Go-Go's, received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/go-gos/|title=The Go-Go's|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> She and the band were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on October 30, 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/go-gos-rock-hall-induction-cleveland/|title=Go-Go’s Inducted Into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|website=[[Ultimate Classic Rock]]}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
[[File:Belinda Carlisle 1976 yearbook photo.png|thumb|left|upright=.8|Carlisle in her 1976 yearbook photo]]
Belinda Jo Carlisle was born in [[Hollywood]], [[Los Angeles]], California, on August 17, 1958{{sfn|Carlisle|2011|p=6}} to Harold Carlisle, a gas station employee, and his wife, Joanne (née Thompson), a homemaker.{{Sfn|Carlisle|2011|pp=5–6}} Her mother met her father, who was 20 years her senior, at age 18, and Carlisle was born nine months later.{{sfn|Carlisle|2011|p=6}} She was named after her mother's favorite film, ''[[Johnny Belinda (1948 film)|Johnny Belinda]]'' (1948).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/500308/belinda-carlisle/|work=MTV|title=Belinda Carlisle|access-date=January 26, 2017}}</ref> Carlisle was the first of seven siblings; she has three brothers and three sisters. When she was five years old, Carlisle's father abandoned their family, and she has stated that she spent most of her childhood impoverished.{{sfn|Carlisle|2011|p=23}} As a teenager, she recalled owning "like, two outfits."<ref name=vanmeter/> According to Carlisle, her mother was very religious, while her father was not.<ref name=vanmeter/> In an interview with ''[[Slash (fanzine)|Slash]]'' magazine, she described herself as a reject from a [[Southern Baptist]] household.<ref>Lips Unsealed: A Memoir by Belinda Carlisle, p. 54</ref>

Her mother later remarried Walt Kurczeski, who Carlisle says was an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]],<ref name=vanmeter/> and with whom she had a tumultuous relationship.{{Sfn|Carlisle|2011|p=7}} The family moved frequently during her childhood, from [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley]] to [[Reseda, Los Angeles|Reseda]], before settling in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] when Carlisle was seven years old.{{Sfn|Carlisle|2011|pages=8–9}} At age ten, Carlisle began to express interest in music, and recalled [[the Beach Boys]], [[Cat Stevens]], [[the Stylistics]], and [[the Animals]] as being early musical influences.{{Sfn|Carlisle|2011|p=16}}

The family relocated again during Carlisle's adolescence, this time to [[Thousand Oaks, California]]; she attended Colina Junior High School in Thousand Oaks, where she was a 3rd-string guard on the men's basketball team, and later [[Newbury Park High School]], where she was a [[Cheerleading|cheerleader]]. During her teenage years, [[Belinda Carlisle discography|Carlisle]] became rebellious: "By the time I hit fourteen, I'd gone really wild," she said. "I ran away from home, smoked [[Cannabis|pot]], dropped [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|acid]]&nbsp;... you name it, I'd try it."<ref name=bio>{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/belinda-carlisle-5882#early-life|work=Biography.com|title=Belinda Carlisle - Singer|publisher=[[The Biography Channel]]|access-date=January 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219093300/http://www.biography.com/people/belinda-carlisle-5882#early-life|archive-date=February 19, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> After high school, Carlisle worked at a [[Jo-Ann Stores|House of Fabrics]] store, and as a [[photocopier]] at the [[Hilton Inc.|Hilton Hotels Corporation]] in Los Angeles at age 18.{{Sfn|Carlisle|2011|p=5}} She took night classes attending [[beauty college]], but dropped out in the first year.{{Sfn|Carlisle|2011|pages=31–2}} At the age of 19, Carlisle left her parents' home to pursue a career in music.{{Sfn|Carlisle|2011|p=6}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/celebs/women/singer_60/93_belinda_carlisle.html#bio|title=Belinda Carlisle Biography|publisher=AskMen.com|access-date=November 27, 2010|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Bghno6Tj?url=http://www.askmen.com/celebs/women/singer_60/93_belinda_carlisle.html#bio|archive-date=October 25, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Carlisle's first venture into music was in 1977 as drummer for the [[punk rock]] band the [[Germs (band)|Germs]], under the name Dottie Danger.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bag|first=Alice|author-link=Alice Bag|title=Violence Girl: East L.A.

Soon after leaving the Germs, she co-founded the Go-Go's (originally named the Misfits) with friends and fellow musicians Margot Olavarria, Elissa Bello, and [[Jane Wiedlin]]. Olavarria and Bello were soon out of the group and the new line-up included bassist-turned-guitarist [[Charlotte Caffey]], guitarist-turned-bassist [[Kathy Valentine]], and drummer [[Gina Schock]].<ref name=ggbio>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220175635/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/the-go-gos/biography|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/the-go-gos/biography|work=Rolling Stone|title=The Go-Go's|series=Biography|access-date=September 19, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 20, 2015}}</ref> All five women were largely untrained musicians, and Carlisle recalls having to use tape as [[fret]] markers during their initial songwriting: "[Charlotte] had to show us how to plug in our amps," she said.<ref name=vanmeter>{{cite journal|journal=Spin|title=Lucky Star|author=Van Meter, Jonathan|pages=43–5; 86|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Wf6jGc6xEcC&q=belinda+carlisle+pop+music&pg=PA43|date=January 1990}}</ref>

The Go-Go's went on to become one of the most successful American bands of the 1980s, helping usher [[new wave music]] into popular American radio, and becoming the first and only all-female band that wrote their own music and played their own instruments<ref name=vanmeter/> to ever achieve a No.&nbsp;1 album, ''[[Beauty and the Beat (The Go-Go's album)|Beauty and the Beat]]'', which featured the hits "[[We Got the Beat]]" and "[[Our Lips Are Sealed]]".<ref name=ggchartalbum>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/411192/go-gos/chart?f=332|work=Billboard|title=The Go-Go's - Chart history|series=Catalog Albums|access-date=September 22, 2017|archive-date=September 21, 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20170921064541/http://www.billboard.com/artist/411192/go-gos/chart?f=332|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Go-Go's recorded two more studio albums on [[I.R.S.

===Solo career===
====1985–1990====
The Go-Go's disbanded in 1985, and Carlisle embarked on a solo career. Carlisle's first solo album ''[[Belinda (Belinda Carlisle album)|Belinda]]'' was released in 1986,<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Spin|page=11|title=Working Out|date=August 1986|via=Google Books|author=Cabrini, John|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6_7o2bblz_cC&q=belinda+carlisle&pg=PA11}}</ref> also on I.R.S. Records.<ref name=ggbio/> This album was successful in North America and was certified Gold in the United States and Platinum in Canada. Her summer hit "[[Mad About You (Belinda Carlisle song)|Mad About You]]" peaked at No.&nbsp;3 in the United States,<ref name=ggbio/> topped the Canadian Singles Chart, and charted in the top 10 in Australia. "Mad About You" was followed by the Motown-influenced single "[[I Feel the Magic]]" written by [[Charlotte Caffey]], and by a cover version of the [[Freda Payne]] song "[[Band of Gold (Freda Payne song)|Band of Gold]]". All three songs were included on her debut album. The single "[[Since You've Gone]]", co-written by [[Lindsey Buckingham]] of [[Fleetwood Mac]], was used only for promotion. [[Susanna Hoffs]] co-wrote the single "I Need a Disguise" in which she also sang back-up vocals along with [[Jane Wiedlin]]. [[Duran Duran]]'s [[Andy Taylor (guitarist)|Andy Taylor]] played guitar on some album tracks and appeared in her "Mad About You" [[video clip]].{{sfn|Carlisle|2011|p=138}}

During this time, Carlisle also had songs featured on [[Soundtrack|movie soundtrack]]s, notably "In My Wildest Dreams" from the movie ''[[Mannequin (1987 film)|Mannequin]]'', "Shot in the Dark" from the [[Anthony Michael Hall]] thriller ''[[Out of Bounds (1986 film)|Out of Bounds]]'', as well as "Dancing in the City" from the [[Whoopi Goldberg]] movie ''[[Burglar (film)|Burglar]]'' (1987).<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Jet|title=Whoopi Goldberg Makes her Funniest Film in 'Burglar'|page=56|date=April 20, 1987|volume=72|number=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q7MDAAAAMBAJ&q=Whoopi+Goldberg+Makes+her+Funniest+Film+in+%27Burglar&pg=PA56|via=Google Books}}</ref>

The musical style of 1987's ''[[Heaven on Earth (Belinda Carlisle album)|Heaven on Earth]]'' eschewed the 1960s-influenced pop of Carlisle's first album in favor of slickly produced 1980s power-pop. It was released in the United States through [[MCA Records|MCA]], and in the United Kingdom through [[Virgin Records]]. The album became a Top&nbsp;5 bestseller in the UK and Australia, and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].<ref name=bio/> 

The album's first single, "[[Heaven Is a Place on Earth]]", topped the single charts in the United States and the UK, with the [[dance music|dance]] mix of the song also topping the [[Dance Club Songs|''Billboard'' dance chart]] in the United States. The [[music video|promotional video]] was directed by [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning American actress [[Diane Keaton]]. The second single from the album was the [[Diane Warren]]-penned "[[I Get Weak]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;2 in the United States and No.&nbsp;10 in the UK. The third single from the album was "[[Circle in the Sand]]", another Top&nbsp;10 hit in the United States, the UK, and Germany. "[[World Without You]]" was another British hit. Following the success of the album, Carlisle embarked on the ''Good Heavens'' world tour, which sold out [[Wembley Arena]] in London.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

Carlisle's follow-up to the success of ''Heaven on Earth'' was ''[[Runaway Horses (album)|Runaway Horses]]'', released on October 23, 1989. The album hit the Top 5 in both Australia and the UK, certified [[Music recording sales certification|double platinum]] in Australia and [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] in the UK and in Canada. The first release, "[[Leave a Light On (Belinda Carlisle song)|Leave a Light On]]", peaked at No.&nbsp;11 in the United States, and became another Top 5 smash in the UK, Australia and Canada.{{sfn|Carlisle|2011|p=155}} 

1989 also saw Carlisle performing vocals with [[The Smithereens]] in a duet with [[Pat DiNizio]] on the song "Blue Period". The song was featured on their album "[[11 (The Smithereens album)|11]]". 

The second United States single, "[[Summer Rain (Belinda Carlisle song)|Summer Rain]]", reached No.&nbsp;30 in early 1990.<ref name=fullchart/> The song reached No.&nbsp;6 in Australia. It was the final release from ''Runaway Horses'' in the UK where it was released as the album's sixth single in December 1990, peaking at No.&nbsp;23 in January 1991.<ref name=fullchart/> Three further singles were released: the title track; "[[La Luna (song)|La Luna]]", which reached the Top 10 in Switzerland and Top 20 hit in Germany and Australia; and "[[(We Want) The Same Thing]]", which reached No.&nbsp;6 in the UK.<ref name=fullchart>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/24617/belinda-carlisle/|work=The Official Charts Company|title=Belinda Carlisle: Full Official Chart History|access-date=September 22, 2017}} (Default is single history; may require users to click "album" tab to view album chart history).</ref>

In the late autumn of 1990, the Go-Go's reunited for a tour to support their first best-of album, ''[[Greatest (The Go-Go's album)|Greatest]]'', including a new recording of the cover song "Cool Jerk" (The Go-Go's original cover was featured on their 1980 European EP, with a second version being released in 1982). A notable feature of the tour was an anti-fur campaign, where the band members supported the [[animal rights]] organization [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Larkin, Colin|year=1997|title=The Virgin Encyclopedia of Eighties Music|publisher=Virgin|page=210|isbn=978-0-753-50159-7}}</ref>

====1991–1999====
In 1991, Carlisle released her fourth solo album, ''[[Live Your Life Be Free]]''. The album marked somewhat of a return to 1960s-influenced music for Carlisle and included songs mainly written and produced by [[Rick Nowels]] but also two songs co-written by Carlisle. The single "[[Do You Feel Like I Feel?]]" was accompanied by a video inspired by the [[B movie]] ''[[Attack of the 50 Foot Woman]]''. The title track, "[[Live Your Life Be Free]]", released as first single outside the United States, was a Top 20 hit single in many countries reaching No.&nbsp;12 in the UK<ref name=fullchart/> and No.&nbsp;13 in Australia. Subsequent releases "[[Half the World (Belinda Carlisle song)|Half the World]]" and "[[Little Black Book (song)|Little Black Book]]" (co-written by [[Marcella Detroit]] under her real name Marcy Levy) were also hits outside the United States. The album was also a success in Europe (Top 10 in the UK and Gold certification). To date, "Do You Feel Like I Feel?" is Carlisle's final single to enter in the Billboard Hot 100 chart, peaking at No.&nbsp;73.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

Still active in Europe and Australia with a record contract at Virgin Records, her 1992 greatest hits album ''[[The Best of Belinda, Volume 1]]'' reached No.&nbsp;1,<ref name=fullchart/> and was certified double platinum in the UK and platinum in Australia. This first greatest hits album included all the hits taken from ''Heaven on Earth'', ''Runaway Horses'', and ''Live Your Life Be Free''. The United States version of the album was named ''Her Greatest Hits'' and also included songs from the first album ''Belinda''.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

Carlisle's fifth solo album, ''[[Real (Belinda Carlisle album)|Real]]'', was released in 1993 on the Virgin label in the United States and in Europe. Produced without Nowels, the disc was a departure from Carlisle's polished pop music formula. Even the album's [[cover art|cover]] photograph featured her with little or no make-up. Carlisle co-produced and co-wrote much of the album, collaborating heavily with friend and ex-Go-Go [[Charlotte Caffey]]. The album was Carlisle's fifth consecutive to reach the UK Top 10 peaking at number 9.<ref name=fullchart/> It peaked also at number 23 in Sweden. Its first single, "[[Big Scary Animal]]", peaked at No.&nbsp;12 in the UK.<ref name=fullchart/> The second single from ''Real'' was "[[Lay Down Your Arms (The Graces song)|Lay Down Your Arms]]", which made the Top 30 in the UK.<ref name=fullchart/> [[Gregg Alexander]] of the [[New Radicals]] co-wrote the single "Here Comes My Baby".  Also in 1993, Carlisle provided guest vocals on [[The Lemonheads]] album ''[[Come on Feel the Lemonheads]]''.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

The Go-Go's reunited in 1994 to support the retrospective double-CD ''[[Return to the Valley of The Go-Go's]]'', their second collection, which featured three new songs, including the single "[[The Whole World Lost Its Head]]". However, the band broke up again, soon after the promotional [[Concert#Concert tour|tour]].{{cn|date=August 2020}}

Carlisle returned to the recording studio, and resumed working again with [[Rick Nowels]]. In 1996 she released in the UK and Australia her sixth solo album, ''[[A Woman and a Man]]'', on the [[Chrysalis Records|Chrysalis]] label. This album, consisting of mostly relaxed [[Adult contemporary music|adult pop]], revitalized her solo career in Europe, and included several hits. The leadoff single, "[[In Too Deep (Jenny Morris song)|In Too Deep]]", returned Carlisle to the [[UK Singles Chart|UK Top 10]] for the first time in six years, reaching No.&nbsp;6. "[[Always Breaking My Heart]]", written and produced by [[Roxette]]'s [[Per Gessle]], also made the UK Top 10, peaking at No.&nbsp;8.<ref name=fullchart/>

The album spawned two further hits in the UK: "[[Love in the Key of C]]", and "[[California (Belinda Carlisle song)|California]]", which featured arrangement and back-up vocals by [[Brian Wilson]].{{sfn|Carlisle|2011|p=191}} The album reached No.&nbsp;12 in the UK,<ref name=fullchart/> and was certified gold. As a result of ''A Woman and a Man''{{'}}s UK success, the album was released in the United States during the summer of 1997 on the small [[Ark 21 Records|Ark21]] label. In 1997, she recorded "[[I Won't Say (I'm in Love)]]" for the Disney movie ''[[Hercules (1997 film)#Music|Hercules]]''. The song was released as a single exclusively in France and Germany.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

In 1999, Carlisle released a greatest hits album in the UK, a double-disc on the Virgin label, collectively titled ''[[A Place on Earth: The Greatest Hits]]''. The first disc featured Carlisle's hits plus three new tracks recorded for the album: the single "[[All God's Children (song)|All God's Children]]", and the songs "A Prayer for Everyone" and "Feels Like I've Known You Forever". The second disc, subtitled ''A Place on Earth'', contained previously released [[remix]]es of some of her hits and some [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]s which had not previously been released on CD. Some of the remixes were by [[William Orbit]]. ''[[A Place on Earth: The Greatest Hits]]'' was certified Gold in the UK and went on to sell in excess of one million copies worldwide. A European version was marketed with an interview CD in which Carlisle provides answers to over 40 questions sent in by fans.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

===Later recordings and Go-Go's reunions===
====2001–2009====
[[File:The Go-Gos - Belinda Carlisle, Kathy Valentine and Gina Schock.jpg|thumb|right|Carlisle live with the Go-Go's, Austin, Texas, 2008]]
In 2001, the Go-Go's reunited again and released an album of new material, ''[[God Bless The Go-Go's]]''. [[Green Day]]'s lead singer [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] co-wrote the only released single "[[Unforgiven (The Go-Go's song)|Unforgiven]]".{{cn|date=August 2020}}

''God Bless The Go-Go's'' received mixed reviews from critics. Peter Fawthrop of ''AllMusic'' wrote "Every bit as Go-Go's, that is, as their non-hits and less remarkable material. While the Go-Go's sound is intact, there is not a "We Got the Beat" or a "Head Over Heels" to be found. It is feasible that in this age of pop rebirth, the Go-Go's decided it was now or never ... The album doesn't attempt to update the band's sound with hip-hop moves or electronic frippery, for which God should bless 'em, indeed. The girls' hold on the current pop world remains so strong that Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong co-writes a song ("Unforgiven") in impeccable Go-Go's drag".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/god-bless-the-go-gos-mw0000001425|title=God Bless The Go-Go's|author=Fawthrop, Peter|work=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=September 21, 2017}}</ref>

Between 2011 and 2012, Carlisle embarked on a United States tour with the Go-Go's, which included concerts at the [[Greek Theatre (Los Angeles)|Greek Theatre]] in Los Angeles in August 2011 and the [[Hollywood Bowl]] in September 2012. In March 2013, Carlisle released her first U.S. single in 17 years titled "[[Sun (Belinda Carlisle song)|Sun]]", an up-tempo pop song, which was included on "ICON", a new greatest hits compilation album. The single was also released in the United Kingdom. The song was written by Carlisle, [[Jane Wiedlin]] of the Go-Go's and singer-songwriter [[Gabe Lopez]]. Lopez also produced the song. While the track did not chart, it received positive reviews.<ref>{{cite web|last=Heal |first=Clare |url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/music/419626/Belinda-Carlisle-Still-punk-rock-in-my-heart |title=Belinda Carlisle: Still punk rock in my heart |work= Daily Express |access-date=September 21, 2017|date=August 4, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiocremebrulee.com/80sartistreturns/belinda-carlisles-sun-radiates-in-all-its-glory |title=Belinda Carlisle's "Sun" radiates in all its glory |work=Radio Creme Brulee |date=March 28, 2013 |access-date=September 9, 2017}}</ref> 

In August 2013, Edsel Records released remastered, three-disc versions of ''Heaven on Earth, Runaway Horses, Live Your Life Be Free'' and ''Real''. Each album comprised a remastered version of the original LP followed by the [[single (music)#7-inch format|7-inch]] or radio edits of each single from that album, a second disc of remixes and [[single (music)#12-inch format|12-inch]] versions of all the singles, and a DVD comprising the promotional videos for the singles. Some of singles and remixes had never previously been released on CD. In March 2014, a new ''Greatest Hits'' titled ''[[The Collection (Belinda Carlisle album)|The Collection]]'' was released containing 18 hits and one new song, "Goodbye Just Go", along with a DVD of 18 videos. The album reached number 24 in the UK albums chart.<ref name=fullchart/>

Also in March 2014, another digitally remastered, five-disc retrospective collection titled ''Anthology'' was released. The anthology included "Dancing in the City", which had previously only been available on the Japanese LP/CD for the soundtrack to the 1987 movie "I Won't Say I'm in Love" which had previously only been released in 1997 as a CD single in France. It also included all three singles from her first album and all four singles from ''A Woman and a Man''. Later in 2014, Carlisle's three other studio albums, ''Belinda, A Woman and a Man'' and ''Voila'' were re-issued by Edsel on CD, although there were a number of issues with their production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.superdeluxeedition.com/news/disney-cast-gate-crash-new-belinda-carlisle-deluxe-reissue/|title=Disney cast gate crash new Belinda Carlisle deluxe reissue|work=Super Deluxe Edition|date=September 3, 2014|author=Sinclair, Paul|access-date=December 22, 2016}}</ref>

Carlisle confirmed in a radio interview in August 2015 that she has completed work on a new album, tentatively earmarked for release in January 2016.
