'''Willem "Wim" Sonneveld''' ({{IPA-nl|ˌʋɪləm ʋɪm ˈsɔnəvɛlt}}; 28 June 1917 – 8 March 1974) was a Dutch [[cabaret]] artist and singer. Together with [[Toon Hermans]] and [[Wim Kan]], he is considered to be one of the 'Great Three' of Dutch cabaret. Sonneveld is generally viewed as a Dutch [[cultural icon]] for his work and legacy in theatre, musicals and music.

==Biography==

Wim Sonneveld was born in Utrecht, Netherlands, to Gerrit Sonneveld and Geertruida van den Berg. In 1922, at a very young age, he lost his mother. After his time at school, where he was the class clown, he had a few unsuccessful jobs.

In 1932 he started singing in an amateur choir, the ''Keep Smiling Singers'', after which he teamed up with [[Fons Goossens]] in 1934 to form a duo and perform at anniversaries of associations and institutions. Later that year he met reviewer [[Huub Janssen]] and after a journey through France in 1936 they started living together in Amsterdam, at first on the Westermarkt, later on the Prinsengracht.<!-- This is in direct contradiction with this webpage http://www.eenlevenlangtheater.nl/wim%20sonneveld/Biografie/Artiest%20en%20jongste%20bediende%20tegelijk that even lists addresses -->{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} In that same year he worked for [[Louis Davids]]. During the day he worked as an administrator and in evening he played small roles and sang [[chanson]]s. In that same period he performed with his partner Huub in his own club ''De Rarekiek''. In 1937 he sang in 'cabarets' (floor shows in nightclubs) with [[Suzy Solidor]] and [[Agnes Capri]] in France.

After the [[German declaration of war against the Netherlands|declaration of war of 1940]] he returned to the Netherlands, where he acted in plays and in the [[revue]] of [[Loekie Bouwmeester]]. In 1940 he performed in the ''Theater der Prominenten'' and at [[Abraham van der Vies]]' ''De Sprookjesspelers''. Here he met [[Conny Stuart]]. In 1943 he formed his own association, consisting among others of Conny Stuart, [[Lia Dorana]], [[Albert Mol]], [[Joop Doderer]], [[Hetty Blok]] and [[Emmy Arbous]].

Wim Sonneveld was gay, though not openly as it would have been unacceptable during that era.

He died in 1974 due to a heart attack.

==Rim Ram==
Between 1943 and 1959 he staged with his own cabaret association ''Rim Ram'' a great number of shows:
*1943 ''Alleen voor dames'' (text by [[Hella Haasse]])
*1944 ''Sprookjes''

==Willem Parel==
A famous creation of Wim Sonneveld was ''Willem Parel'', son and grandson of a [[Dutch street organ]] grinder<!-- note: linking organ grinder instead definitely gives the wrong impression, look at the linked article for the reason --> as well as chairman of the ''En-pé-gé'', the Dutch Pearl Association (Nederlands ParelGenootschap). This brought him great success on the [[Omroepvereniging VARA|VARA]]-radio in the early fifties. ''Parel'' would expose movingly about ‘organ grinding in general and the psychology of the penny cup in particular’. Over time Wim Sonneveld came to hate his creation, but he knew that ''Willem Parel'' drew a large audience and he couldn't live from just singing chansons. In 1955 a movie was shot called ''[[The Wondrous life of Willem Parel]]''.

==Film, musical, solo==
Wim Sonneveld has played in some movies: the aforementioned ''The Wondrous life of Willem Parel'' as well has the Hollywood thriller ''[[The Pink Hippopotamus]]'' (1956) and a later the films ''[[Silk Stockings (1957 film)|Silk stockings]]'' (1957) and ''[[Wasp End]]'' (1957).

After 702 performances of the musical ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', since 1960, after his own club went bankrupt in 1959, with which he ‘wore out’ three Eliza Doolittles ([[Margriet de Groot]], [[Dorien Mijksenaar]] and [[Jasperina de Jong]]) in his role as dr. Higgins, he went solo with television shows like ''Doe es wat, meneer Sonneveld'' (1962) and ''Blijf in Holland'' (1963). In 1964 he again took the stage with ''Een avond met Wim Sonneveld''.

Remarkable was his threefold guest role in episode 16 of the television series ''{{ill|Ja zuster, nee zuster|nl}}'' by [[Annie M.G. Schmidt]] and [[Harry Bannink]] in 1967, as himself, Arie Pruijselaar junior and Arie Pruijselaar senior. In 1967 he performed alongside [[Ina van Faassen]] in a theater show and in 1971 with [[Willem Nijholt]] and [[Corrie van Gorp]]. His last film was ''Op de Hollandse toer'' (1973).

He would have liked to end his career singing French chansons, because his heart lay in France, where he had a house in [[Roquefort-les-Pins]].

On 1974-03-08 Wim Sonneveld died at the age of 56 in the VU hospital in Amsterdam from his second heart attack.

Even though Wim Sonneveld never publicly stated that he was homosexual, he shared his life only with men, first with Hubert Janssen, later with prop designer, text writer and painter [[Friso Wiegersma]] (1925–2006) whom he met in 1947 and who created the character ''Nikkelen Nelis'' (Nickle Nelis) for him, a character, made from the well-known street singer from Rotterdam, named {{ill|Koperen Ko|nl}} (Copper Ko).
