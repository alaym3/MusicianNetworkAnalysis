==History==

===Pre–Electric Wizard (1988–1993)===
[[File:Electric Wizard logo.png|right|thumb|The Electric Wizard logo]]

The origins of Electric Wizard go back to 1988 when [[Jus Oborn]] formed the band Lord of Putrefaction. They put out three demo tapes from 1989 to 1991 and also did one split with Mortal Remains. In 1992, the name was changed to Thy Grief Eternal after Adam Richardson left the band. They put out one demo under this name titled ''On Blackened Wings''. In 1993, James Evans left the band and they once again changed their name, shortening it to Eternal. The band released two demos under this name. After Gavin Gillingham left the band, Oborn started Electric Wizard.  The recordings from this era were issued on the ''[[Pre-Electric Wizard 1989–1994]]'' compilation in 2006.

===Formation, debut album, ''Come My Fanatics'', ''Dopethrone'' and ''Let Us Prey'' (1993–2003)===
[[File:Black Sabbath (1970).png|left|thumb|Electric Wizard's name was taken from two Black Sabbath songs.]]

Electric Wizard began in [[Wimborne]] in Dorset, [[England]] during 1993, and was composed of guitarist-vocalist [[Jus Oborn]], bassist Tim Bagshaw, and drummer Mark Greening. The band's name was taken from two [[Black Sabbath]] songs: "Electric Funeral" and "[[The Wizard (Black Sabbath song)|The Wizard]]".  Oborn remarked, "Is the name Electric Wizard made out of two Black Sabbath song titles? Hahahaha, yeah it is!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalrage.com/interviews/268/electric-wizard-smoking-cans.html |title=Interview: Electric Wizard - Smoking cans - Called the number of the beast and left a voicemail |publisher=Metalrage.com |access-date=2013-04-20}}</ref>

In 1995 the band signed to [[Rise Above Records]] and released their [[Electric Wizard (album)|self-titled debut album]].<ref name=rock>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicmight.com/artist/united+kingdom/dorset/bournemouth/electric+wizard|title=MusicMight :: Artists :: ELECTRIC WIZARD|publisher=Musicmight.com|access-date=27 September 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413094439/http://www.musicmight.com/artist/united+kingdom/dorset/bournemouth/electric+wizard|archive-date=13 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The music was in the vein of traditional doom metal, and received positive reviews. Later that year, they released the song "[[Electric Wizard/Our Haunted Kingdom|Demon Lung]]" as a split-single with Our Haunted Kingdom (later to become [[Orange Goblin]]).

In 1997 the band recorded and released ''[[Come My Fanatics…]]'', which introduced the [[stoner metal|stoner]] and [[sludge metal|sludge]] elements that have come to define Electric Wizard's sound.<ref name=rock/> Later that year, [[Man's Ruin]] Records released the ''[[Chrono.Naut]]'' EP.<ref name=rock/> Following the release of ''Come My Fanatics...'' Electric Wizard released the ''[[Supercoven]]'' EP on Bad Acid Records in 1998 and then recorded and released ''[[Dopethrone]]'' in 2000, which was described by [[Allmusic]] as a "dirge masterpiece"<ref name="Allmusic Dope">{{cite web|last=Rivadavia|first=Eduardo|title=Electric Wizard: Dopethrone|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/dopethrone-mw0000115961|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=22 April 2013}}</ref> and is regarded as the band's [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]].<ref name="Allmusic LUP" /> Kerrang! has noted that despite the "groovy" [[stoner rock]] vibes usually associated with the band, lyrics for songs like ''We Hate You'' were more like "an indiscriminate spray of bile against everyone" than the typical stoner rock themes of "shagging and cars".<ref>{{cite news |title=The 50 Most Evil Songs Ever |url=https://www.kerrang.com/features/the-50-most-evil-songs-ever/ |access-date=20 July 2019 |publisher=Kerrang!}}</ref>

During the three years following the release of ''Come My Fanatics...'', the members of Electric Wizard encountered a series of setbacks, with Oborn suffering a collapsed eardrum during a concert and later severing a fingertip while laying a carpet.<ref name="kerrang"/> Greening broke his collarbone in an accident.<ref name=amg>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/electric-wizard-mn0000164175/biography|title=Electric Wizard - Biography - AllMusic|work=AllMusic|access-date=27 September 2014}}</ref> Speaking to ''[[Kerrang!]]'' in July 2009, Jus Oborn remembered the days of the recording:

{{quote|At the time, we were pretty bad people. I got arrested for arson of a car, outside a police station. Tim [Bagshaw] went to nick a crucifix off a church roof so we could use it onstage, then slipped, fell off through the window and sliced his arm open. He got community service for that. Then Mark [Greening] got nicked for robbing an [[Off licence|offie]]. He smashed the window, nicked a bottle of whiskey, then sat there drinking it outside! We weren't very nice people, to be honest. We were feeding off that shit at the time. It made us feel like we were more of a [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band.<ref name="kerrang">Ruskell, Nick. ''[[Kerrang!]]'' #1269, July 2009. Treasure Chest. An Intimate Portrait Of Life In Rock. Jus Oborn, p.60</ref>}}

Their next album, ''[[Let Us Prey]]'', was released in 2002. It was Electric Wizard's most experimental record to date.<ref name="Allmusic LUP">{{cite web|last=Rivadavia|first=Eduardo|title=Electric Wizard: Let Us Prey|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/let-us-prey-mw0000221508|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=22 April 2013}}</ref> Following the release, the band embarked on a North American tour that raised tensions between band members. It was announced that the band was breaking up after the last concert of the tour. However, Electric Wizard did a UK tour with [[Cathedral (band)|Cathedral]] soon after, with Justin Greaves (of [[Iron Monkey (band)|Iron Monkey]]) on drums.<ref name=rock/><ref name="amg"/> In April 2003, Greening and Bagshaw left the band.<ref name=rock/>

===Line-up changes and ''We Live'' (2003–2007)===
[[File:Electricwizard LizBuckingham.jpg|left|thumb|Liz Buckingham live in Damnation Festival 2009]]

In August 2003, Oborn revealed Electric Wizard's new line-up – drummer Greaves, second-guitarist [[Liz Buckingham]] (of [[13 (band)|13]] and [[Sourvein]]), and bassist Rob Al-Issa.<ref name=rock/> This new lineup recorded ''[[We Live]]'' in 2004, just days after Buckingham began rehearsing with the band. As Oborn explained, the addition of Buckingham was crucial given the departure of his previous writing partner, Bagshaw:

{{quote|1=(The addition of) Liz was the most important element...because Tim had left the band and we were writing partners so to speak. So when Liz came aboard we were writing partners again. Our styles were very similar. We have the same sort of down-stroke pattern. And since we were writing together, Electric Wizard was happening again. I have to have a writing partner.<ref name=Prefix>{{cite web|last=Bugbee|first=Tim|title=Electric Wizard: Interview|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/features/electric-wizard/elecrric-wizard-interview/47944/|publisher=Prefix|access-date=24 April 2013}}</ref> }}

The band toured England and Australia in support of the album and played at the 2005 [[Roadburn]] Festival. Greaves left the band in 2006 and was replaced by Shaun Rutter.  The parting was not amicable, with Oborn remarking that "We fell out big time with that loser. You know, I would piss on his grave."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/features/electric-wizard/elecrric-wizard-interview/47944|title=Electric Wizard: Interview|work=Prefixmag|access-date=27 September 2014}}</ref>

===''Witchcult Today'', ''Black Masses'' and touring (2007–2012)===
[[File:Tas%2C_Electic_Wizard.jpg|upright|thumb|Tas, bassist of Electric Wizard]]

In November 2007, the band released ''[[Witchcult Today]]''. In 2008, bassist Rob Al-Issa left the band and was replaced by Tas Danazoglou.<ref name=riseabove>[http://www.riseaboverecords.com/bandpages.asp?band=ewiz]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907170002/http://www.riseaboverecords.com/bandpages.asp?band=ewiz |date=7 September 2006 }}</ref>  Three years later, in November 2010, Electric Wizard released their seventh album: ''[[Black Masses]]''.

[[File:Electric Wizard - Tuska 2011 - 01.JPG|left|thumb|Electric Wizard performing at Tuska Open Air 2011]]

On 31 March 2012, Electric Wizard played in [[London]] at the [[London Forum|HMV Forum]], debuting its newest members, bassist Glenn Charman and drummer Simon Poole. A 7" EP titled ''Legalise Drugs and Murder'' was available for sale at the show. After the gig it was announced that it would be released worldwide and that more EPs would follow.  On 1 October 2012, some copies of ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' came with a cassette EP of ''Legalise Drugs and Murder'' which contained the two songs from the 7" along with two outtakes and two new songs. Electric Wizard also headlined the 2012 edition of [[Maryland Deathfest]] on 27 May, their first show in the United States in ten years.

===Label complications, founding member Mark Greening rejoins, ''Time to Die'' and ''Wizard Bloody Wizard'' (2013–present)===

They headlined the 2013 edition of the [[Roadburn Festival]] called the 'Electric Acid Orgy,' which was also curated by Oborn.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadburn.com/tag/the-electric-acid-orgy/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-02-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227151212/http://www.roadburn.com/tag/the-electric-acid-orgy/ |archive-date=27 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
