==Early and personal life==
Caroline Esmeralda van der Leeuw was born on 26 April 1981, in [[Amsterdam]], the Netherlands<ref name="Riviera Life - EP Caro Emerald">{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/nl/album/riviera-life-ep/id432592760|title=iTunes Preview|year=2011|work=Riviera Life – EP Caro Emerald reviews|publisher=Grandmono Records, & Apple Inc|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112174933/https://itunes.apple.com/nl/album/riviera-life-ep/id432592760|language=nl, en|access-date=6 May 2012|archive-date=12 November 2012}}</ref> to a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] father and an [[Aruba]]n mother. She started singing lessons at age 12 with James Gilloffo in Amsterdam and joined a girl vocal group, ''Les Elles'', under his guidance. Following high school, she trained as a jazz vocalist at the [[Amsterdam Conservatory]], graduating in 2005.{{fact|date=September 2021}}

During her September 2013 UK tour, she announced her pregnancy. She gave birth to a girl in March 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nu.nl/achterklap/3736763/caro-emerald-bevallen.html|title=Caro Emerald bevallen|publisher=nu.nl|date=26 March 2014|access-date=29 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://caroemeraldtribute.com/caro-emerald-pregnant-gives-birth-baby/|title=CARO EMERALD GIVES BIRTH TO HER BABY|publisher=caroemeraldtribute.com|date=3 April 2014|access-date=29 June 2014}}</ref>

Emerald gave birth to a second daughter in August 2017.{{fact|date=September 2021}}

==Career==
In early 2007 Dutch producer Jan van Wieringen invited van der Leeuw to sing the vocal on a demo he was producing with David Schreurs. The song, "[[Back It Up (Caro Emerald song)|Back It Up]]", had been written by Schreurs and Canadian songwriter [[Vincent DeGiorgio|Vince Degiorgio]] and was based around a [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] beat created by Robin Veldman and Jan van Wieringen. Caro's jazzy vocal was considered a "perfect match" for the new song.<ref name="hitquarters">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_DSQ_A.html |title=Q&A on Caro Emerald with songwriter David Schreurs |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=23 September 2011 |access-date=27 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623154922/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_DSQ_A.html |archive-date=23 June 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The demo was pitched to various publishers and labels but without result.<ref name="hitquarters"/> But online the demo quickly reached public notice around the world and radio stations started playing the song.

Degiorgio, Schreurs, van Wieringen and van der Leeuw realised their sound had potential and started working on a studio album. Writing began in the summer of 2008 using "Back It Up"'s mix of 40s–50s jazz, [[easy listening]], orchestral Latin, combined with infectious beats as a model.<ref name="hitquarters"/> Adopting a sample based approach but with live instrumentation, the writing sessions drew from a wide range of influences including jazz organist Jackie Davis, exotica composer [[Martin Denny]], [[Mambo (music)|mambo]] king [[Perez Prado]], 1920s/30s jazz and van der Leeuw's own vocal inspirations of [[The Andrews Sisters]], [[Billie Holiday]] and [[Sarah Vaughan]].<ref name="hitquarters"/> The usual method would be for Schreurs to create the ideas and backing tracks and then get together with top line writer and lyricist Degiorgio to write the songs. Van der Leeuw co-wrote several songs on the album, and van Wieringen co-created the tracks for "The Other Woman" and "Dr Wanna Do".<ref name="hitquarters"/> Schreurs and Degiorgio are credited as "Creative Directors".

===2009–12: ''Deleted Scenes from the Cutting Room Floor''===
[[File:Caro Emerald 2010.jpg|thumb|right|Emerald singing in Rotterdam, Netherlands on 9 July 2010]]
After record labels either refused or failed to sign the project, Schreurs set up their own label Grandmono. "Back It Up" was released as debut single on 6 July 2009. The song gained airplay and popularity overnight and listed in the [[Dutch Top 40]] for 12 weeks, peaking at No. 12. It became the most played song on 3FM in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/kunst/article1366735.ece/Caro_Emerald_meest_gedraaid_op_3FM|title=Caro Emerald meest gedraaid op 3FM|date=6 April 2010|work=de Volkskrant|language=nl|trans-title=Caro Emerald most played on 3FM}}</ref>

Debut album ''[[Deleted Scenes from the Cutting Room Floor]]'' was released on 28 January 2010 in The Netherlands by Grandmono. It entered at #1 in the Album Charts and stayed there for weeks. By August 2010, the album had been #1 for 27 weeks, beating Michael Jackson's chart record for ''Thriller'' (26 weeks #1 in 1983).<ref name="nu.nl record" /> The album returned to #1, spending a total of 30 non-consecutive weeks on top spot of the Dutch Albums Chart.

The album reached double platinum (>100,000 copies) status in the Netherlands on 5 July 2010.<ref name="dplatinum">{{cite web|url=http://www.caroemerald.com/news/double-platinum/|title=Double Platinum|date=5 July 2010}}</ref> In August 2010 it reached triple platinum,<ref name="nu.nl record"/> in November 2010 four times platinum (200,000),<ref name="4x Platinum NED">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbiznewz.nl/artikel_12047_caro-emerald-brengt-speciaal-album-uit.html |title=4x Platinum NED |date=November 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724165526/http://www.showbiznewz.nl/artikel_12047_caro-emerald-brengt-speciaal-album-uit.html |archive-date=24 July 2011 }}</ref> and in December 2011, sextuple platinum (>300,000 copies).
