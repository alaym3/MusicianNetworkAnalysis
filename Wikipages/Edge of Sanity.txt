'''Edge of Sanity''' was a Swedish [[death metal]] band that, alongside [[Opeth]], is commonly regarded as being the first to fuse [[extreme metal]] styles like [[death metal|death]] and [[black metal]] with [[progressive rock]]. The group was founded by [[Dan Swanö]] in 1989 and ended in 2003.

== History ==
Edge of Sanity began as a death metal band with their debut release ''[[Nothing but Death Remains]]''. The band's second release, ''[[Unorthodox (Edge of Sanity album)|Unorthodox]]'', with tracks like "Enigma" and "When All Is Said", showed Edge of Sanity branching out from some of the genre's conventions. ''[[The Spectral Sorrows]]'', ''[[Until Eternity Ends]]'', and ''[[Purgatory Afterglow]]'' continued the trend, so that by the release of ''[[Crimson (Edge of Sanity album)|Crimson]]'' (1996), Edge of Sanity was a [[progressive metal]] band. ''Crimson'' was a 40-minute [[concept album]] consisting entirely of one track, concerning a [[post-apocalyptic]] future in which mankind had lost the ability to breed. After one more album, ''[[Infernal (Edge of Sanity album)|Infernal]]'' (1997), guitarist/vocalist/songwriter [[Dan Swanö]] left Edge of Sanity, and his departure is generally associated with a decline in quality in the band's material. Swanö was replaced by Robert Karlsson, the vocalist of [[Pan.Thy.Monium]] (a [[side project]] in which Swanö was also involved), but after one more album, ''[[Cryptic (album)|Cryptic]]'', the band split up.

In 2003, Swanö revived the outfit as a one-man band (with several session musicians), and recorded a sequel to ''Crimson'', ''[[Crimson II]]''. Immediately after, he re-dissolved the project.

The ''Kur-Nu-Gi-A'' demo was re-released on LP in 2011, and on CD in 2012.
