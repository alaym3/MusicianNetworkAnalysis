'''Parkway Drive''' are an Australian [[metalcore]] band from [[Byron Bay, New South Wales]], formed in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/parkway-drive-p820903|title=Parkway Drive – Biography, Albums, Streaming Links – AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}</ref><ref>[http://www.fretplay.com/reviews.php?band=parkway_drive&title=Killing+with+a+Smile&format=cd&id=B000GH3CO8 Killing with a Smile] Fret Play</ref> As of 2018, Parkway Drive have released six studio albums, one EP, two DVDs, a split album and one book, titled ''Ten Years of Parkway Drive''. The band's latest four albums have reached the top 10 of the Australian [[ARIA Charts]], with ''[[Ire (album)|Ire]]'' reaching number 1 in October 2015, and ''[[Reverence (Parkway Drive album)|Reverence]]'' in May 2018.

The band's line-up has been consistent since the addition of bassist Jia O'Connor in 2006, with Brett Versteeg having left in 2004 and Shaun Cash in 2006.

== History ==
=== Early years and ''Killing with a Smile'' (2003–2006) ===
{{main|Killing with a Smile}}

Parkway Drive were formed at the beginning of 2003.<ref name="Official Band Facebook Page">{{cite web|title=Band's Official Bio|url=https://www.facebook.com/parkwaydrive/info?tab=page_info|website=Facebook|access-date=7 July 2015}}</ref> The band took their name from the street where their home rehearsal space and live venue, 'The Parkway House', was located.  The 2009 documentary 'Parkway Drive: The DVD' explains that there was a lack of venues for [[punk rock]] and [[hardcore punk]] bands to practice and perform and that 'Parkway House' was like 'a little oasis for us and all our friends'.<ref name="ReferenceA">'Parkway Drive: The DVD'  Epitaph Records, 2009</ref> The group played their first show at the Byron Bay Youth Centre where [[I Killed the Prom Queen]] vocalist [[Michael Crafter]], visiting from Adelaide, also first saw the group and gained their interest.  The ''[[I Killed the Prom Queen / Parkway Drive: Split CD]]'' was released June 2003 and both groups toured Australia over the rest of the year.  After signing with [[Resist Records]], the band released the ''[[Don't Close Your Eyes (EP)|Don't Close Your Eyes]]'' EP in 2004 and opened for [[Shadows Fall]], [[Chimaira]], [[Hatebreed]] and [[Alexisonfire]] on subsequent Australian tours.  Winston McCall commented on the EP in early 2005 that he was surprised that 'for six songs it's done amazing for us...I'm surprised that kids picked it up so well'<ref>Parkway Drive-previously unreleased interview 2005 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umEIP9EhbgU</ref> Following Brett Versteeg's replacement by Shaun Cash, Parkway Drive flew to the [[United States]] where they recorded their debut full-length ''[[Killing with a Smile]]'' with [[Killswitch Engage]] guitarist [[Adam Dutkiewicz]] in just two weeks.  Manager Graham Nixon later noted that 'it was not the "done thing" for an Australian band to head overseas and work with a producer of that sort of calibre'.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The album debuted in the Australian Album (ARIA) charts at 39.  In 2006 the group toured in Europe, their first time performing overseas, and later returned to North America.  In late May 2006, bass player Shaun Cash left the band for personal reasons with full support from the rest of the members. He was replaced by their "merch guy" and long-time friend, Jia "Pie" O'Connor.  Parkway Drive signed to American punk label [[Epitaph Records|Epitaph]] in June 2006.

=== ''Horizons'' (2007–2009) ===
{{main|Horizons (Parkway Drive album)}}

Following their return to Adam Dutkiewicz's studio, ''Horizons'' was released on 6 October 2007. The album was generally acclaimed by critics and fans alike; especially [[Blunt Magazine]], 'simply slays from the get go'<ref name="Blunt Magazine's review">{{cite web|title=PARKWAY DRIVE'S HORIZONS TOPS THE CHARTS!|url=http://epitaph.com/news/article/parkway-drives-horizons-tops-the-charts|website=Epitaph|access-date=7 July 2015}}</ref> and awarded it 10/10, and planet-loud.com, which suggested that it would 'set the benchmark for metal albums to come'. It debuted at number&nbsp;6 on the [[ARIA Charts]].<ref>{{cite web |author= Hung, Steffen | url = http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Parkway+Drive&titel=Horizons&cat=a | title=Parkway Drive ''Horizons'' | publisher = Australian Charts Portal (Hung Medien) | access-date = 18 January 2014 }}</ref>

In an interview with NME, Winston spoke briefly about an upcoming fourth studio album. Winston is quoted as saying, "We've got ideas for this record that are bigger than anything we've done in the past. We're trying to pencil it in, but we want to get in the studio sooner rather than later."<ref name="NME-PD4A discuss"/> The vocalist also gave an update on the condition of the band's guitarist Luke 'Pig' Kilpatrick. The guitarist has been forced to play with the band from a wheelchair after a surfing accident, but McCall said he was improving and would be up on his feet for the band's next tour. He said: "I think he'll be in a cast for a couple more weeks. His leg had swelled up to the size of a football, but it's come down now. He still can't walk on it yet. It's made for an interesting couple of tours and it'll be weird when he is walking around again."<ref name="NME-PD4A discuss">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/parkway-drive/57913 |title=Parkway Drive discuss 'bigger' new album at Sonisphere| publisher = [[New Musical Express]] |date=10 July 2011 |access-date= 14 July 2012}}</ref>
