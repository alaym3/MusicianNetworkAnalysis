'''iamamiwhoami''' ({{IPAc-en|,|ai|ae|m|.|ae|m|ai|.|'|h|u:|ae|m|ai}} {{respell|eye|am|am|eye|HOO|am|eye}}) is the [[electronic music]] and [[audiovisual]] project of Swedish singer-songwriter [[Jonna Lee (singer)|Jonna Lee]] in collaboration with her longtime record producer [[Claes Björklund]]. The project has since 2009 released audiovisual series on their {{URL|youtube.com/iamamiwhoami|YouTube}} channel followed by a large international audience. Visual collaborators of the project include Swedish director Robin Kempe-Bergman, until 2013, and visual collective Wave, consisting of Lee and cinematographer John Strandh, and formerly Agustín Moreaux.

Their videos in particular have spread [[viral marketing|virally]], and the project is notable not only for its artistic multimedia output, but also the creators' leveraging of YouTube and [[viral video]]s to disseminate their music and the accompanying videos, garnering a [[cult following]]. In 2010, Lee founded a record label for iamamiwhoami, [[:sv:To whom it may concern|To whom it may concern.]], which she runs. One of their videos called ''"y"'' is listed at the first place of Google search under the search results for the letter "y", which generated more than 50 million views already, since it is the first link Google would get you to if the web browser does not autocomplete ''"youtube"'' properly. This slowly became a viral [[internet meme]].

Since December 2009, iamamiwhoami's [[music video]]s have been released in several series on the project's YouTube channel, while their music is available through digital music retailers. By May 2013, a total of 24 videos had been released on iamamiwhoami's YouTube channel. Running from an initial set of prelude videos to a series of full-length songs, the videos and songs form a continuous story featuring Lee as a protagonist. iamamiwhoami released their debut physical album, the audiovisual album ''[[Kin (iamamiwhoami album)|Kin]]'', in June 2012, while the initial full-length series, ''[[Bounty (album)|Bounty]]'' (2010–2011), was released physically in June 2013. A third album, ''[[Blue (iamamiwhoami album)|Blue]]'', was released in November 2014.

The project has also remixed songs for [[Moby]] and [[The Irrepressibles]], as well as performing live in [[concert|concert tours]] revolving around the releases of ''Kin'', ''Bounty'' and ''Blue''. An online [[performance art]] "concert" in support of the ''Bounty'' series was streamed online in 2010, taking place in a forest. On 29 April 2015, a second online [[performance art]] "concert" in support of the ''Blue'' series was streamed online; this "concert" was released physically and digitally in September 2015 as ''[[Concert in Blue]]'', and includes the first new iamamiwhoami song ("The Deadlock") since 2014.

In March 2017, Lee embarked on solo career as [[ionnalee]], stating that it is continuation of iamamiwhoami, though "the two projects will not exist simultaneously".

==Background==
[[File:Jonna Lee 20080607.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Lee, seen performing here in 2008, developed iamamiwhoami with Björklund after the release of her second album in 2009]]
Musically, iamamiwhoami is the brainchild of Swedish singer-songwriter [[Jonna Lee (singer)|Jonna Lee]] and her longtime record producer [[Claes Björklund]].<ref name="playground"/> Lee, giving an interview to Playgroundmag.net, stated that iamamiwhoami was born from "experiencing convention in its purest form", a reference to her previous releases as a solo artist.<ref name="playground">{{cite web| url=http://www.playgroundmag.net/music/music-magazine-articles/music-interviews/trying-to-lift-the-veil-of-mystery-off-iamamiwhoami| title=Trying To Lift The Veil Of Mystery Off iamamiwhoami| publisher=Playgroundmag.net| author=del Amo, Sergio| date=7 September 2012| access-date=7 September 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916183308/http://www.playgroundmag.net/music/music-magazine-articles/music-interviews/trying-to-lift-the-veil-of-mystery-off-iamamiwhoami#| archive-date=16 September 2012| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref>
Indeed, iamamiwhoami's musical and visual style is a departure from the guitar-led [[pop music|alternative pop]] that Lee had previously created, although she acknowledges that "the change is probably more apparent from an external point of view."<ref name="thisispaper"/> Lee began developing iamamiwhoami in 2009 and started creating the music together with Björklund in real time with their releases in 2009–2010. Lee has explained they wanted it to "grow freely and [tear] the formerly [sic] by its roots and start over",<ref name="playground"/> envisioning the ability to "physically visualize" their songs. Lee began collaborating with visual directors Robin Kempe-Bergman, Agustín Moreaux, still photographer John Strandh, and most recently, fashion and costume designer Mathieu Mirano, who are credited as part of the visual team of iamamiwhoami,<ref name="playground"/><ref name="credits">{{cite web |url=http://www.bangonpr.com/campaigns/press-release/iamamiwhoami-kin-3rd-september-album-release-kin-video-trailer |title=Press release: Album release: iamamiwhoami; kin |publisher=Bang On |date=7 June 2012 |access-date=6 March 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BmHcOmYk?url=http://www.bangonpr.com/campaigns/press-release/iamamiwhoami-kin-3rd-september-album-release-kin-video-trailer# |archive-date=29 October 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and Lee has defined the collective as being herself in a "collaboration with amazing people" that she loves, also stating "iamamiwhoami is not something [she] can shake off."<ref name="notion 2012">{{cite news|last=Davidson-Vidavski|first=Doron|title=What can you do with nothing?|url=http://www.planetnotion.com/2012/09/17/iamamiwhoami-what-can-you-do-with-nothing-pt-2/|newspaper=Notion Magazine|date=18 September 2012}}</ref> The process of forming iamamiwhoami began with "a need of change" and the fact that there were songs already in development.<ref name="thisispaper">{{cite web| url=http://thisispaperstories.com/iamamiwhoami/| title=iamamiwhoami Interview| publisher=This is paper| author=Gasior, Zuzanna| date=3 September 2012| access-date=7 September 2012| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908150911/http://thisispaperstories.com/iamamiwhoami/| archive-date=8 September 2012| df=dmy-all}}</ref> Lee has acknowledged they are working with limited means independently through her label [[:sv:To whom it may concern|To whom it may concern.]] to maintain their creative freedom.

Since the upload of their first video to [[YouTube]], the project's videos and music have been continuous and operate in "real time", and each song is completed just before being made available for viewing.<ref name="thisispaper"/> The first upload, "Prelude 699130082.451322" surfaced on YouTube in December 2009 and was the beginning of a since abstract storyline. Lee has said of this process "every time a production starts, it's being released very soon after to keep the conversation with the audience in the present. It's a chronological storyline of an evolution, from the very beginning up to now. I think the Internet is the place where you can do that."<ref name="dazeddigital">{{cite web |url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/14028/1/exclusive-iamamiwhoami |title=Exclusive Q&A: iamamiwhoami |work=[[Dazed]] |date=20 August 2012 |access-date=7 September 2012}}</ref> Lee states that essentially, "the core of iamamiwhoami is our music, where the lyrics are the script for the story happening and being shared in real time.

==History==

===2009–2011: First uploads and ''Bounty''===
[[File:Iamamiwhoami live at Way Out West 2011.jpg|thumb|250px|iamamiwhoami's first concert before a live audience at [[Way Out West (festival)|Way Out West]] portrayed their unconventional performance style and featured Lee singing to the audience on a bed made of toilet rolls.

The appearance continues the events in the videos of "; john" and "clump" that were released simultaneously to the Way out west performance.]]

The first two iamamiwhoami videos were uploaded to YouTube on 4 December 2009, and were forwarded from an anonymous email account to a number of music journalists and blogs.<ref name="goodw">{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Cragg|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/15/iamamiwhoami-good-worker|title=New music: iamamiwhoami – good worker |newspaper=The Guardian|date=15 March 2012|access-date=8 September 2012}}</ref> These videos continued and featured an unknown blonde woman whose face had been distorted, and displayed themes such as birthing and growth. Imagery associated with the [[folklore]] of the [[Mandrake (mythology)|mandragora]] (the flowering humanoid, berries, dogs used to pull out the mandrake, and semen of a hanged man) recurs throughout iamamiwhoami's videos. Each of the first six clips end with a drawing of a different animal (a [[goat]], [[owl]], [[whale]], [[bee]], [[llama]], and [[monkey]]). Having blogged about the videos, [[MTV]] journalist James Montgomery received a package by a messenger, which included a lock of blond hair, a piece of bark, and a pictogram of the six animals with the question "Says what?"<ref name="mtvpackage">{{cite web| url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2010/03/05/iamamiwhoami-mail/| title=Iamamiwhoami Makes Contact, Sends MTV News A Package| publisher=MTV| author=Montgomery, James| date=5 March 2010| access-date=13 September 2012| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917010650/http://newsroom.mtv.com/2010/03/05/iamamiwhoami-mail/| archive-date=17 September 2012| df=dmy-all}}</ref> Furthering the mystery; the sixth video ("23.5.12.3.15.13.5–8.15.13.5.3383") ends with the woman whispering "Why" or "Y."<ref name="CB1" /> Each video displayed a numerical code as part of its title. When indexed into the alphabet, these spell out words such as "educational", "I am", "its me", "mandragora", "officinarum", and "welcome home". ''[[Mandragora officinarum]]'' refers to the mandrake root, which when fresh or dry may cause hallucination and grows from a hanged man's sperm .<ref name="CB1">{{cite web| url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=11318| title=Musical Mystery| author=Lundin, Leigh| date=14 March 2010| publisher=Criminalbrief.com}}</ref> In 2012, Lee revealed their aim is to "let the work be in focus and push the boundaries of convention in different forms."<ref name="mtviggy"/> This initial stage of the project received positive, if skeptical reviews and many websites found themselves asking readers to guess the identity of the blonde woman within the clips. iamamiwhoami was speculated to be a project of many artists, including [[Lady Gaga]], [[Goldfrapp]], [[Björk]], [[The Knife]], [[Trent Reznor]] and [[Christina Aguilera]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Seitz|first=Carine|title=Who am I? Why I am...|url=http://www.leithermagazine.com/2010/09/25/who-am-i-why-i-am%E2%80%A6.html|newspaper=Leither Magazine|date=25 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Robinson|first=Peter|title=Pop goes the viral|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/mar/27/pop-music-viral-videos-guidelines|newspaper=The Guardian|date=26 March 2010}}</ref> The number series which were highly stylized teaser videos setting the tone of the project, established several mysteries, and served to foreshadow the projects' complete songs. For instance, "23.5.12.3.15.13.5–8.15.13.5.3383" contained vocally distorted lyrics that later appeared in the later song "o". On 25 November 2017, a full version of "13.1.14.4.18.1.7.15.18.1.1110" was released under the side project [[Jonna Lee (singer)|ionnalee]], featuring the distorted full verse as the main chorus of the song "GONE"

The second "series"<ref name="playground"/> of the iamamiwhoami project began with the upload of a full song and music video titled "b", one month following the final prelude video. Garnering positive reviews for its dramatic change in style and heavy use of a [[piano]] as well as vocal distortion techniques, the song was the first to be uploaded to the [[iTunes Store]], being offered as a paid [[music download|digital download]] on 15 March 2010.<ref name="popjusticeB">{{cite web| url=http://www.popjustice.com/briefing/that-iamamiwhoami-song-is-on-itunes-by-the-way/49418/| title=That iamamiwhoami song is on iTunes, by the way| author=Robinson, Peter| date=25 March 2011| access-date=13 September 2012| publisher=[[Popjustice]]}}</ref> Although a "reveal" of the artist behind the moniker was anticipated, the videos showed a clearer view of Jonna Lee's face. Swedish media recognized Lee. However, Lee's previous North American management team [[Philadelphonic]] commented "If Jonna is involved in this, we have no knowledge of such."<ref name="phil">{{cite web|first=James |last=Montgomery|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1633956/iamamiwhoami-swedish-singer-jonna-lee-behind-viral-campaign.jhtml |title='Iamamiwhoami': Is Swedish Singer Jonna Lee Behind Viral Campaign?|publisher=MTV|date=15 March 2010}}</ref> Despite this, her involvement in the project was eventually thought to be confirmed with the release of the video for "t", in which her face was fully revealed without any makeup or distortion to conceal her identity. According to rraurl.com and [[MTV Brasil]], "o" was directed by Viktor Kumlin, who is also the director of Lee's music video for "Something So Quiet". This proved to be false.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tecoapple.mtv.uol.com.br/2010/08/30/clipes-exibidos-no-mtv-labteco-apple-26/ |title=Clipes exibidos no MTV Lab/teco apple #26 |publisher=MTV Brasil |date=30 August 2010 |access-date=20 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315202655/http://tecoapple.mtv.uol.com.br/2010/08/30/clipes-exibidos-no-mtv-labteco-apple-26/ |archive-date=15 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rraurl.com/videos/1582/iamamiwhoami_-_o |title=vídeos: iamamiwhoami – o [2010] |publisher=rraurl.com |access-date=20 February 2012}}</ref> As the seven videos with letter titles were slowly released, fans gathered that the videos were likely to spell the word "Bounty". Each of the seven videos begins with the corresponding sound of the animal, however, the animal sounds are not present in the released tracks. The conclusion of the live performance art event ''[[In Concert (iamamiwhoami album)|IN CONCERT]]'' of 2010 reveals that the [[onomatopoeia]] used to represent the animals' calls can be made to approximate the pronunciation of the English word "Bounty". On 7 February 2011, several registered songs on [[International Standard Musical Work Code|ISWC]] were discovered to be closely related to iamamiwhoami. For example, songs titled, "Up!/Higher", "The Sound of Letting Go/Love", and "Little Hope/Sing a Song of Fire" all pertain to lyrics in iamamiwhoami's songs, "b", "o", and "y", respectively. The works were registered by Lee and Claes Björklund. These songs were registered around the same time as several songs from Lee's ''This Is Jonna Lee'' 2009 album.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://iswcnet.cisac.org/iswcnet/MWI/result/detail.do?workDetails=0 |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160214163306/http://iswcnet.cisac.org/iswcnet/MWI/result/detail.do?workDetails=0 |archive-date=14 February 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In October 2010, iamamiwhoami requested a volunteer from the audience to be presented to them with their full name through a message video; no instructions followed. Fans of the project set up voting polls and presented a volunteer from the YouTube community with the YouTube username of ShootUpTheStation. One month later, on 16 November 2010, a live online concert was streamed on To whom it may concern.'s website where ShootUpTheStation was led through the forests of iamamiwhoami by Lee and brought to be buried and burned inside a paperbox. ''In Concert'' featured performances of both the preludes, ''Bounty'' and a new song titled "." and ran at one hour and four minutes.<ref name="playground"/>

In August 2011, iamamiwhoami played their first live show at the annual [[Way Out West (festival)|Way Out West Festival]] in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden. After a long absence, they released the songs "; John" and "Clump" which was revealed to be an [[epilogue]] to ''Bounty''.<ref name="playground"/><ref name="epilogue">{{cite web| url=http://www.mtvhive.com/2012/02/01/iamamiwhoami-6-11-12/| title=New iamamiwhoami Video Teases Happening on 6/11/12| publisher=MTV Hive; [[MTV]]| author=Ehrlich, Brenna| date=1 February 2012| access-date=27 April 2012}}</ref> As a conclusion to ''Bounty'', Bullett Media posted an interview article with iamamiwhoami for their Winter 2011 'Secrets' Issue. Questions were answered strictly with sampled lyrics from the current repertoire of songs, with some additional and unknown phrases purported to be lyrics for future musical releases. The article also included promotional images of iamamiwhoami, nude in the forest and posed among similar elements from "; John" and "T".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bullettmedia.com/article/iamamiwhoami/ |title=An Inscrutable Interview with (and Exclusive Photo Series from) iamamiwhoami |publisher=Bullett Magazine |date=11 November 2011 |access-date=20 February 2012}}</ref> The article is referenced to be written and photographed by iamamiwhoami. Following their performance at Way Out West, iamamiwhoami began recording and preparing their debut studio album.<ref name="playground"/>

''Bounty'' was critically well received, with Kathy Iandoli of [[MTV]] describing ''Bounty'' as having "portrayed a flaxen, ethereal goddess twisting her way throughout nature, while other [videos] included distorted imagery that housed industrial, synthy soundscapes set on fire. The combination was mysterious, yet alluring, representing a combination of horror film imagery with new age sensibilities. The titles to the songs were equally vague, ... numbers and clusters of words .... The videos never fell short of several hundred thousand views&nbsp;– and even much greater ... people obviously took notice."<ref name="mtviggy"/>
At the [[Grammis|Swedish Grammis]] held on January 2011, iamamiwhoami won their first award in the category of "Innovator of the Year" ({{lang-sv|Årets innovatör}}), which had been newly inaugurated. An anonymous woman, later confirmed to be Nina Fors,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/nina.fors.92 |title=Nina Fors's Facebook |publisher=Facebook |language=sv}}</ref> the mother of Emil Fors, a Swedish musician who worked as production manager for the videos, received the award on their behalf and handed to the speaker an envelope with the words "To whom it may concern." taped in front. The content is revealed to be an empty piece of white paper. Before leaving, the woman acknowledged by saying, "Thank you. That's all I can say". iamamiwhoami won an [[O Music Awards|MTV O Music]] award in 2012 in the "Digital Genius" category.

===2012–2013: ''Kin''===
On 1 February 2012, iamamiwhoami's YouTube channel once again became active with the posting of the video "kin 20120611", which was sent to music blogs much in the same manner as the original release.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.nme.com/nme-video/youtube/id/AfLYfz_25BI| title=iamamiwhoami; kin 20120611 video| work=[[NME]]| access-date=7 September 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002203847/http://www.nme.com/nme-video/youtube/id/AfLYfz_25BI| archive-date=2 October 2013| url-status=dead}}</ref> This continued with each successive release in the ''Kin'' series.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ehrlich |first=Brenna |url=http://blog.omusicawards.com/2012/05/iamamiwhoami-drops-new-track-rascal-before-debut-album-in-june/ |title=iamamiwhoami Drops New Track, "Rascal", Before Debut Album In June |website=[[O Music Awards]] |date=8 May 2010 |access-date=10 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619045331/http://blog.omusicawards.com/2012/05/iamamiwhoami-drops-new-track-rascal-before-debut-album-in-june/ |archive-date=19 June 2013}}</ref> It was speculated that the title of the video pertained to the date 11 June 2012, using the Gregorian big-endian dating system most common in Sweden. The video was followed by the original music video in the ''[[Kin (iamamiwhoami album)|Kin]]'' series, titled "Sever", later the opening track on iamamiwhoami's debut studio album. The series consists of nine songs and videos, which culminates in "Goods" and is a continuation of the story arc founded by the original uploads, online concert and ''Bounty'' series.<ref name="thisispaper"/> Together, the videos form a collective film also titled ''Kin'' which was released in CD/DVD and has been screened at several European film festivals.<ref name="inconcert">{{cite web |url=http://towhomitmayconcern.cc/in_concert.html |title=in concert |publisher=towhomitmayconcern.cc |access-date=7 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829232518/http://www.towhomitmayconcern.cc/in_concert.html |archive-date=29 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> A digital download of each song was released to retailers one day following the YouTube upload.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cotter |first=Neal |url=http://www.insidevandy.com/life/music/article_2023782a-717f-11e1-92a6-001a4bcf6878.html |title=Iamamiwhoami: An audiovisual experience |publisher=Inside Vandy |date=18 March 2012 |access-date=20 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825070155/http://www.insidevandy.com/life/music/article_2023782a-717f-11e1-92a6-001a4bcf6878.html |archive-date=25 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In terms of imagery, much of ''Kin'' contains large hairy creatures which interact with Lee throughout the narrative, which she explained as "represent[ing] a part of me and most others. Life with it is very much a delight. I have experienced the consequences of living without it."<ref name="playground"/> The release resulted in the first interviews conducted by Lee in promotion of the album, for the first time describing the process of creating the iamamiwhoami visuals and music. She referred to the making of ''Kin'' in an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'' as having been "nine months of hard labour".<ref name="guardian 2012"/> Lee has also explained ''Kin'' "came to life after a close encounter with the audience at the first live concert in 2011" and called herself a "proud mother".

In preparation for the release, iamamiwhoami were signed to [[Cooperative Music]], a British group of independent labels founded by [[V2 Records]].

Originally produced and released in a series of singles throughout 2010 and 2011, ''Bounty'' was released as an album on 3 June 2013 on iamamiwhoami's label To whom it may concern, distributed by Cooperative Music, a group of independent labels. The first music video from ''Bounty'', titled "B", was released on 14 March 2010 on iamamiwhoami's YouTube channel, after which followed "O", "U-1", "U-2", "N", "T" and "Y". Digital singles were released shortly after each music video was uploaded to YouTube. The titles collectively formed the word "Bounty". While it was assumed that these songs solely consisted of ''Bounty''{{'s}} track listing, in 2011 two more singles and music videos, "; John" and "Clump" were released and were not confirmed as belonging to ''Bounty'' until June 2012 when iamamiwhoami's YouTube channel grouped them into a playlist named "Bounty" along with the previous tracks mentioned.

On 4 December 2012, iamamiwhoami's label website To whom it may concern. was updated with a note on the front page which stated "20130603&nbsp;– iamamiwhoami; Bounty", forecasting a physical release of the ''Bounty'' series. This was confirmed on the very next day when the Release section of the website displayed ''Bounty''{{'s}} album cover art, along with its track listing.<ref>[http://shop.towhomitmayconcern.cc/Releases]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

iamamiwhoami embarked on a worldwide tour in support of ''Kin'' and ''Bounty'' in 2012 and 2013, including their first dates in North America.
