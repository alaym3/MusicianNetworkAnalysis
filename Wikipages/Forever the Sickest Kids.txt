==History==
===Early projects and formation (2001–2006)===
In 2001–2004, the members of Forever the Sickest Kids were slowly brought together from separate paths. From [[Burleson, Texas]], Jonathan Cook and Kyle Burns were in a band together in [[Burleson High School|high school]], Good Day Josif.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.purevolume.com/gooddayjosif|title=Good Day Josif|website=Purevolume.com}}</ref> About the same time in [[Hurst, Texas]], Marc Stewart and Kent Garrison were in a band together called Triumph Over Tragedy,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.purevolume.com/triumphovertragedy|title=Triumph Over Tragedy|website=Purevolume.com}}</ref> with friends from their high school. In [[Rockwall, Texas]], Turman and Bello were in an acoustic pop band, Committed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.soundclick.com/artist/default.cfm?bandID=197367|title=Committed|website=Soundclick.com|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>

The three bands all played local clubs around Dallas/Fort Worth, and on occasion, at the same events and concerts. Burns and Stewart are step-brothers, resulting in Good Day Josif and Triumph Over Tragedy sharing a practice space in their parents' garage.

In 2004, upon the break up of Good Day Josif and Triumph over Tragedy, Cook, Stewart and Burns formed the band the Flipside,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/music/The+Flipside|title=The Flipside music, videos, stats, and photos|website=Last.fm|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> along with their friend Chris Hill. Soon after, Craig Calloway (from Triumph over Tragedy) was added to the Flipside's lineup, and Garrison soon replaced Chris Hill on bass guitar. The band went on to play at numerous local shows and released an independent eponymous [[Extended play|EP]].<ref name="Formation" />

Around the same time, Committed broke up, and childhood friends Austin Bello and Caleb Turman formed an [[Acoustic music|acoustic]]/[[Electronic music|electronic]] project called Been Bradley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/music/Been+Bradley|title=Been Bradley music, videos, stats, and photos|website=Last.fm|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> Although they never released any official albums or EPs, many of the band's songs were released online through the group's [[MySpace]] profile, such as "All for Angela" and "X Me Out."<ref name="Formation" />

When both bands, the Flipside and Committed, eventually ended, Cook and Stewart came into contact with Bello and Turman, and it was suggested that the remaining members from both bands could form in a new band. Their new band, Forever the Sickest Kids, was formed. Cook remained on vocals, Turman took on rhythm guitar and vocals, Bello was on bass guitar and vocals, Stewart was on lead guitar, Burns was on drums, and Garrison switched to [[keyboard (instrument)|keyboard]]. Calloway (of the Flipside) did not take part in the band, but would later be a part of the band [[Artist vs. Poet]] as a guitarist.<ref name="Formation" />

===Label signing and ''Underdog Alma Mater'' (late 2006–2009)===
Days after the formation of Forever the Sickest Kids, Cook accidentally spent $350 that the band did not have on [[PureVolume]] to receive a front-page placement of a song. The band also did not have any songs written yet. The band then quickly contacted producer Geoff Rockwell and managed to write the song "Hey Brittany" and have it recorded in a studio. The song was a success and received many plays and views on the Internet. The band landed a record deal with [[Universal Motown Records]] in April 2007. The band released its first EP, ''[[Television Off, Party On]]'', with the label on July 3. Two more EPs, ''The Sickest Warped Tour EP'' and ''[[Hot Party Jamz EP|Hot Party Jamz]]'' followed, months afterward.<ref name="Formation"/>

On April 1, 2008, the band released its first single, "[[Whoa Oh! (Me vs. Everyone)]]", soon followed by a music video. The song would later be re-released as "Whoa Oh!", a duet version featuring [[Selena Gomez]]. It was then announced that the band's debut album, ''[[Underdog Alma Mater]]'', would be released on April 29. The album sold well and was soon followed by the album's second single, "[[She's a Lady (Forever the Sickest Kids song)|She's a Lady]]", which was released on July 14. The music video for "She's a Lady" was released shortly afterward. During this time, the band also covered "[[Men in Black (song)|Men in Black]]" by [[Will Smith]] for the [[compilation album]] ''[[Punk Goes Crunk]]''.

The band went on the 2008 ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' tour from March 14 to May 2, played on its first headlining tour, and later performed on the 2008 Vans Warped Tour. The band appeared on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' on June 12, performing "Whoa Oh! (Me vs. Everyone)". The band then headed to [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] to perform at the annual Summer Sonic Festival. In late September, the band undertook a brief headlining tour in the UK, after [[Cobra Starship]], the original headlining act, postponed its tour. The band played at the [[Warped Tour 2009|2009 Vans Warped Tour]] from July 22 to August 26.

In June, it was announced that ''Underdog Alma Mater'' would be re-released as a [[special edition|deluxe edition]] album. The deluxe edition of the album featured the original twelve songs from ''Underdog Alma Mater'', seventeen additional tracks that were mainly demos and acoustics from the band's old days, and a DVD that included recorded live shows of the band and music videos. The deluxe edition was released on July 7, 2009.

===''The Weekend: Friday'' (mid-2009–2010)===
On October 30, the band released a new single, "[[What Do You Want from Me (Forever the Sickest Kids song)|What Do You Want from Me]]". It was announced that the band would be releasing a new EP entitled ''[[The Weekend: Friday]]'' on November 17, including "What Do You Want from Me". On November 12, the entire EP was streamed on the band's MySpace profile. A music video for "What Do You Want from Me" was released in late December.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbCEcX0pzMg|title=What Do You Want from Me music video|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

On December 9, the band was announced to be the supporting act for British band [[You Me at Six]] on their UK tour from March 2 to March 28, 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.alterthepress.com/2010/03/live-review-you-me-at-six-forever.html|title=Live Review: You Me At Six, Forever The Sickest Kids and We The Kings - O2 Brixton Academy, London - 20.3.2010|first=Sean|last=Reid|website=Alterthepress.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/archive_ymaswtkftskuk/|title=You Me At Six plan UK tour with We The Kings, Forever The Sickest Kids|website=Altpress.com|date=December 9, 2009}}</ref>

On January 25, 2010, the band was featured on an episode of the [[MTV]] series ''[[Silent Library (MTV series)|Silent Library]]''. In February, the compilation album ''[[Punk Goes Classic Rock]]'' was released, with the band covering "[[Crazy Train]]" by [[Ozzy Osbourne]]. In March, a version of "What Do You Want from Me" with slight editing of the lyrics was used in the ending credits of the film ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (2010 film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]''.

The band then released two prequel videos to its single and music video "She Likes (Bittersweet Love)" on its [[YouTube]] account in April. The official full music video was released on April 19.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X-VqlIlSwQ&list=UL|title=She Likes (Bittersweet Love) music video|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> As soon as it was released, it was selected as ''[[Kerrang!]]''{{'}}s video of the week.

Other supporting acts with the band included [[3OH!3]], [[Good Charlotte]], [[Cartel (band)|Cartel]], and [[Simple Plan]].

=== Self-titled album, departure of Garrison and Stewart, and label closure (2010–2011) ===

On September 14, 2010, the band released a new song called "Keep On Bringing Me Down" on YouTube. It was announced that this would be the lead single from ''The Weekend: Saturday'', which was planned to be the continuation from the group's previous EP, ''The Weekend: Friday''. The band then went on "The Summer Camp for the Dope Awesome Kids Tour", which featured [[The Scene Aesthetic]], [[The Ready Set]], [[A Cursive Memory]] and Phone Calls from Home.
[[File:Kent Garrison.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Garrison in 2010]]

On November 25, Cook revealed through his [[Tumblr]] account that the band would not be releasing ''The Weekend: Saturday'', but instead a self-titled album. The band explained this decision was made because as they had gone into the studio with producer [[David Bendeth]], they continued to quickly write more than five songs for the EP and decided to release a full-length album instead.<ref name="Forever Girl"/> While touring, the band began to play a new track from the new album, called "Life of the Party". On November 8, the band leaked the track "I Guess You Can Say Things Are Getting Pretty Serious" on [[Stickam]].

On January 10, 2011, two months before the release of the self-titled album, Garrison posted on his blog that he was leaving the band, stating that he wanted to "pursue other opportunities."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kentallengarrison.com/post/2691979150/future |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-02-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114211831/http://www.kentallengarrison.com/post/2691979150/future |archive-date=2011-01-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A month later, on February 11, the band released a video of them playing an instrumental version of the track "What Happened to Emotion?

We want it to be easy to sing along to but so catchy you don't wanna stop."<ref name="Formation">{{Cite web|url=https://www.jambase.com/band/forever-the-sickest-kids|title=Forever The Sickest Kids: Tour History|date=July 15, 2015|website=JamBase.com|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>

In nearly every song by the band, Cook, Bello, and Turman share [[lead vocals]]. Cook usually sings the [[Refrain|chorus]] of the song, while Bello and Turman take on the [[Song structure (popular music)#Verse|verses]], although it is not limited to this routine. Cook generally sings with a powerful, screeching voice and frequently ranges from a low to high pitch. Bello's vocals are similar to Cook's; however, Bello usually sings with a higher pitch and has a more distinct voice. Turman is known for taking the lead in the band's acoustic songs, such as "Coffee Break" and "Forever Girl", due to having a much softer voice than Cook and Bello. He also sang prominently in "What Happened to Emotion? (Killing Me)", with Cook and Bello only singing the [[Bridge (music)|bridge]] of the song.

[[Blink-182]], [[Fall Out Boy]], [[Weezer]], [[Bowling for Soup]], [[New Found Glory]], and [[Fountains of Wayne]] have served as some of the main influences for the band.<ref>{{cite web|title=Artist Influences for Forever the Sickest Kids|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/forever-the-sickest-kids/related-artists/?filter=influencedBy|website=MTV.com|access-date=2 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302194223/http://www.mtv.com/artists/forever-the-sickest-kids/related-artists/?filter=influencedBy|archive-date=2 March 2016}}</ref>
