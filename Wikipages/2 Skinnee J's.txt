A second cassette release entitled ''American Heroes'', was released in 1994 with the band titled "Too Skinnee J's". Several personnel changes saw original rapper J-Slim bass player Sammy B and guitarist Joey Viturbo part with the band; whilst J Guevara (formerly of Canadian ska band [[Me Mom and Morgentaler]]) and Stevie Spice (of Connecticut ska band Spicy Gribblets) were recruited. Former bassist Sammy B rejoined the band in 1995 as a guitarist and using the name King Vitamin.<ref name=allmusic-2sj/>

Special J, Eddie Eyeball, Lance Rockworthy and Andy Action got together for the band's next reunion tour, billed as "acoustically-charged, tell-all brawls," of which there were seven dates between Feb. 12 and April 16, 2010. These shows were a unique way for fans to connect personally with the band, as they were held at small, intimate venues, and featured heavy audience participation, through Q&As and singalongs. In between acoustic versions of selections from their entire catalog of songs, each band member told stories about how songs were written, life on the road and the evolution of the band. J Guevara was scheduled to join the band for two of the April shows, and several hints were dropped about plans for a "full-on electric" tour to follow in summer 2010.
