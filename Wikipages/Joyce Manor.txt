==Background==
The idea for the name "Joyce Manor" was thought of by Barry. It came from the name of an apartment building by frontman Barry Johnson's house.<ref name="tex" /> Joyce Manor was originally a duo group consisting only of members Johnson and Knobbe, which they first thought of while [[alcohol intoxication|drunk]] during a visit to [[Disneyland]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} Joyce Manor released a split 7" with Summer Vacation in the fall of 2010 via Muy Autentico Records.

They joined 6131 Records in 2010. Their [[Joyce Manor (album)|self-titled full-length debut]] was released in 2011 to a host of critical and fan praise. Punknews named it their "2011 Album of the Year" and it landed the band on many year-end best-of lists.<ref>{{cite web|title=Joyce Manor, The Exquisites, The Weaks|url=http://www.manicproductions.org/event/584353-joyce-manor-danbury/|publisher=Manic Productions|access-date=4 August 2014}}</ref> Joyce Manor moved over to Asian Man Records (and Big Scary Monsters in the UK) for their next album, ''[[Of All Things I Will Soon Grow Tired]]'', released in April 2012. This album contains a cover of [[The Buggles]]' "[[Video Killed the Radio Star]]".<ref>{{cite web|last=Ableson |first=Jon |url=http://www.alterthepress.com/2012/04/atp-track-by-track-exclusive-joyce.html |title=ATP!
