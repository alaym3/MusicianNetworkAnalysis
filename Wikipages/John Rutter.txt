==Biography==
Born on 24 September 1945<ref>{{cite web |last1=Schwarm |first1=Betsy |title=John Rutter |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Rutter |website=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]}}</ref> in London, the son of an industrial chemist and his wife, Rutter grew up living over the Globe pub on London's [[Marylebone Road]].<ref name="macfarlane">{{cite web|last=Macfarlane|first=Alan|title=Interview with John Rutter|url=http://www.alanmacfarlane.com/DO/filmshow/rutter1_fast.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304201132/http://www.alanmacfarlane.com/DO/filmshow/rutter1_fast.htm |archive-date=4 March 2016 |access-date=18 December 2013}}</ref> He was educated at [[Highgate School]] where fellow pupils included [[John Tavener]], [[Howard Shelley]], [[Brian Chapple]] and [[Nicholas Snowman]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=Patrick|last2=Davies|first2=Ian F.|title=Highgate School Register 1833–1988|edition=7th|publisher=Castle Cary Press}}</ref> and as a chorister there took part in the first (1963) recording of [[Britten]]'s ''[[War Requiem]]'' under the composer's baton.<ref name=Naxos>{{cite web|title=About this Recording|url=https://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.557130&catNum=557130&filetype=About%20this%20Recording&language=English|work=Rutter: Requiem/Anthems|publisher=[[Naxos Records|Naxos]]|year=2003|access-date=1 November 2016}}</ref> He then read music at [[Clare College, Cambridge]], where he was a member of the choir. While still an undergraduate, he had his first compositions published, including the "Shepherd's Pipe Carol" which he had written aged 18.<ref name=Naxos/> He served as [[director of music]] at Clare College from 1975 to 1979 and led the choir to international prominence.

In 1981, Rutter founded his own choir, the [[Cambridge Singers]], which he conducts and with which he has made many recordings of sacred choral repertoire (including his own works), particularly under his own label ''[[Collegium Records]]''. He resides at [[Hemingford Abbots]] in Cambridgeshire and frequently conducts many choirs and orchestras around the world.

In 1980, he was made an honorary fellow of [[Westminster Choir College]], Princeton, and in 1988 a fellow of the [[Guild of Church Musicians]]. In 1996, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] conferred a [[Lambeth degree|Lambeth Doctorate of Music]] upon him in recognition of his contribution to church music. In 2008, he was made an honorary Bencher of the [[Middle Temple]] while playing a significant role in the [[2008 Temple Festival]].

From 1985 to 1992, Rutter suffered severely from [[Chronic fatigue syndrome|myalgic encephalomyelitis]] (ME, or chronic fatigue syndrome), which restricted his output; after 1985, he stopped writing music on commission, as he was unable to guarantee meeting deadlines.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4AhL_gzo|title=Composer of the Week: John Rutter |publisher=BBC Radio 3|via=YouTube|access-date=28 September 2014}}</ref>

Rutter also works as an arranger and editor. As a young man, he collaborated with Sir [[David Willcocks]] on five volumes of the extraordinarily successful ''[[Carols for Choirs]]'' anthology series.

He was inducted as a National Patron of [[Delta Omicron]], an international professional music fraternity in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://delta-omicron.org/index00.html |title=Welcome To Delta Omicron International Music Fraternity |publisher=Delta Omicron |access-date=22 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127130549/http://delta-omicron.org/index00.html |archive-date=27 January 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.delta-omicron.org/news/2008Mar29_NAT_Patron.html |title=News |publisher=Delta Omicron |date=29 March 2008 |access-date=22 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725225040/http://delta-omicron.org/news/2008Mar29_NAT_Patron.html |archive-date=25 July 2011 }}</ref> Rutter is also a Vice-President of the Joyful Company of Singers, President of [[The Bach Choir]], and President of the Association of British Choral Directors (ABCD).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.abcd.org.uk/about |title=About ''abcd'' |publisher=Association of British Choral Directors |access-date=7 February 2019}}</ref>

==Compositions==
Rutter's compositions are chiefly choral, and include [[Christmas carol]]s, [[anthem]]s and extended works such as the [[Gloria (Rutter)|Gloria]], the [[Requiem (Rutter)|Requiem]] and the [[Magnificat (Rutter)|Magnificat]].

The world premiere of Rutter's Requiem (1985), and of his authoritative edition of Fauré's [[Requiem (Fauré)|Requiem]], took place with the Fox Valley Festival Chorus, in Illinois. In 2002, his setting of [[Psalm 150]], commissioned for the Queen's [[Golden Jubilee]], was performed at the Jubilee thanksgiving service in [[St Paul's Cathedral]], London. Similarly, he was commissioned to write a new anthem, "This is the day", for the [[wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton]] in 2011, performed at Westminster Abbey during the service.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/royal-wedding/8479433/Royal-wedding-the-Order-of-Service-in-full.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429040318/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/royal-wedding/8479433/Royal-wedding-the-Order-of-Service-in-full.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 April 2011|title=Order of Service|date=28 April 2011|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=7 February 2019}}</ref>

Rutter's work is published by [[Oxford University Press]]. It has been recorded by many choirs, but he conducts his own recordings principally on his label [[Collegium Records]].

==Influences==
Rutter's music is eclectic, showing the influences of the French and English choral traditions of the early 20th century as well as of [[light music]] and [[Great American Songbook|American classic songwriting]]. Almost every choral anthem and hymn that he writes{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} has a subsequent orchestral accompaniment in addition to the standard piano/organ accompaniment, using various different instrumentations such as strings only, strings and woodwinds or full orchestra with brass and percussion. Many of his works have also been arranged for concert band with optional chorus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bandmusicpdf.net/Catalogue8.html |title=Music of John Rutter |publisher=Bandmusicpdf.net |access-date=7 February 2019}}</ref>

Despite composing and conducting much religious music, Rutter told the US television programme ''[[60 Minutes]]'' in 2003 that he was not a particularly religious man yet still deeply spiritual and inspired by the spirituality of sacred verses and prayers.<ref name="cbs">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/12/17/60II/main589173.shtml |title=Spreading Good Cheer |publisher=CBS News |date=11 February 2009 |first= Rebecca |last=Leung |access-date=7 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4727014/The-carol-singers-shining-star.html|title=The carol singers' shining star|first=Michael |last=White|date=14 December 2001|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref> The main topics considered in the ''60 Minutes'' programme, which was broadcast a week before Christmas 2003, were Rutter's popularity with choral groups in the United States, Britain and other parts of the world and his composition ''[[Mass of the Children]]'', written after the sudden death of his son Christopher while a student at [[Clare College, Cambridge|Clare College]], Cambridge, where Rutter himself had studied.

In a 2009 interview, Rutter discussed his understanding of "genius" and its unique ability to transform lives – whether that genius is communicated in the form of music or other media. He likened the purity of music to that of mathematics and connected the two with a reference to the discovery made by the early Greeks that frequencies of harmonic pitches are related by whole-number ratios.<ref name="macfarlane" />

==Reception==
Rutter's music is very popular, particularly in the US.<ref name="cbs" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rhinegold.co.uk/choir_organ/meet-john-rutter-touching-peoples-hearts/|title=Meet John Rutter: Touching people's hearts |first=David |last=Blackwell |publisher=Rhinegold|access-date=7 February 2019}}</ref> In the UK, many hold him in high regard, as illustrated by the following quotation from a review in the London ''[[Evening Standard]]'' (25 September 2005): "For the infectiousness of his melodic invention and consummate craftsmanship, Rutter has few peers".  [[Sue Lawley]] referred to Rutter as "the most celebrated and successful composer of carols alive today"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p009384s|title=John Rutter, Desert Island Discs |publisher=BBC Radio 4 |access-date=7 February 2019}}</ref> and [[Sean Rafferty]] heralded Rutter as "a creator of not just carols, but wonderfully great things for the human voice."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02tms2c|title=John Rutter, In Tune Highlights |publisher=BBC Radio 3 |access-date=25 March 2016}}</ref> One British composer, David Arditti, did not regard him as a sufficiently "serious" composer, saying that Rutter is "hard to take seriously, because of the way in which his sheer technical facility or versatility leads to a superficial, unstable crossover style which is neither quite classical nor pop, and which tends towards mawkish sentimentality in his sugarily-harmonised and orchestrated melodies."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.expansivepoetryonline.com/journal/music112001.html|title=Expansive Poetry Online|publisher=Expansivepoetryonline.com|access-date=28 September 2014}}</ref> ''The Guardian'' remarked that "it is as a writer of carols that he has really made his mark ... His larger-scale works – particularly the Gloria (1974), Requiem (1985) and Magnificat (1990) – are also well established in the choral repertoire."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/friday_review/story/0,3605,414360,00.html|title=Sing a song of Christmas |newspaper=The Guardian |date=22 December 2000 |access-date=7 February 2019}}</ref> [[David Willcocks]] considered Rutter "the most gifted composer of his generation."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicfm.com/composers/rutter/guides/john-rutter-story|title=John Rutter: a Life|publisher=Classic FM|access-date=28 September 2014}}</ref>
