'''Shelton Hank Williams''' (born December 12, 1972), known as '''Hank Williams III''',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hank3.com/ |title=The official website |publisher=Hank3 |access-date=2011-09-14}}</ref> is an American musician, singer and multi-instrumentalist, known for his unique combination of traditional [[country music]], [[rockabilly]], and [[punk rock]].<ref name="Bisdeker" /> He is the principal member of the [[death metal]] and [[metalcore]] band [[Assjack]],<ref name=Jurek>{{cite web|last=Jurek|first=Thom|title=Assjack|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/assjack-mw0000822334|access-date=August 26, 2021|publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> the drummer of [[hardcore punk]] band [[Arson Anthem]], and former bassist of [[Phil Anselmo]]'s band [[Superjoint Ritual]]. He has released eleven studio albums, including five for [[Curb Records]]. Williams is the grandson of [[Hank Williams]], the son of [[Hank Williams Jr.]], the nephew of [[Jett Williams]], and the half-brother of [[Holly Williams]].

==Music career==

===Early career===
Williams spent much of his early career playing drums in [[punk rock]] bands during the late 1980s and early-to-mid-1990s. During this time frame, Williams was informed that he had fathered a son, Coleman Finchum, who was five years old by that time; a family court judge ordered Williams to find more stable employment so that Finchum could receive [[child support]].<ref name=hank3sonIV/>

Williams later played bass guitar in  the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band Superjoint Ritual, now renamed as [[Superjoint]] for legal reasons, led by former [[Pantera]] vocalist [[Phil Anselmo]]. Williams also played drums for [[Arson Anthem]], formed with Anselmo and [[Mike Williams (singer)|Mike Williams]] of the [[sludge metal]] band [[Eyehategod]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=18998 |title=Metal News – Superjoint Ritual Is No More |publisher=Metalunderground.com |access-date=2011-09-14}}</ref>

=== Recordings for Curb Records (1996-2010) ===
Capitalizing on his family name and resemblance to his grandfather, he signed a contract with [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] music industry giant [[Curb Records]]. ''[[Three Hanks: Men with Broken Hearts]]'' was issued shortly thereafter, which spliced together recordings to make it seem that three generations of Williams men were singing alongside one another. In the late 1980s, upon first meeting Hank Williams III, [[Minnie Pearl]], a friend of the late Hank Williams Sr., reportedly said "Lord, honey, you're a ghost", as she was astonished by his striking resemblance to his grandfather.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harris |first=Will |url=http://www.bullz-eye.com/music/interviews/2008/hank_williams_iii.htm |title=A chat with Hank Williams III, Hank Williams III interview, Damn Right Rebel Proud, Tyler Torreance was his manager  |publisher=Bullz-eye.com |access-date=2011-09-14}}</ref>

Williams' first solo album, ''[[Risin' Outlaw]]'', was released in September 1999 to respectable sales and strong reviews, despite Williams's own hatred of the record.<ref>{{cite web| first=Tom | last=Netherland | url=http://www.rockabilly.net/articles/hank3c.shtml | title=Hank Williams III: Like grandfather, like grandson| publisher=Rockabilly.net | date=1999-09-07 | accessdate=2012-04-20}}</ref>

In 2003, Williams recorded ''This Ain't Country'' for Curb, who chose not to release it. On May 17, 2011, Curb released the album under the title ''[[Hillbilly Joker]]'', without the consent or input from Williams after his contract with the label had been terminated. Williams told his fans, "Don't buy it, but get it some other way and burn the hell out of it and give it to everyone."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.savingcountrymusic.com/hank-iii-in-billboard-top-10-for-all-the-wrong-reasons |title=Hank III in Billboard Top 10 For All The Wrong Reasons |publisher=Savingcountrymusic.com |date= June 3, 2011|access-date=2011-09-14}}</ref>

In 2006, after resolving a contractual dispute with [[Curb Records]], Williams released ''[[Straight to Hell (album)|Straight to Hell]]'' on Curb's rock imprint, Bruc. Battles with [[Walmart]] delayed the appearance of this album, which was released on February 28, 2006, as a two-disc set in two formats: a censored version (for Wal-Mart), and an uncensored version that was the first major-label country album ever to bear a [[parental advisory]] warning. ''Straight to Hell'' was also the first release through Curb's [[Bruc Records]] imprint. However, the uncensored version was released through Bruc, and the clean version was released through Curb. One of the songs, "Pills I Took", was written by a little-known Wisconsin group called [[Those Poor Bastards]], who originally released the song on their 2004 CD ''Country Bullshit''.

Williams released [[Assjack]]'s [[Assjack (album)|self-titled debut album]] on August 4, 2009, through Curb.

His next album, ''[[Rebel Within]]'', was released in May 2010, and was his last album with Curb Records.<ref>http://www.hank3.com/media.htm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205172409/http://www.hank3.com/media.htm |date=December 5, 2008 }}</ref> It charted at number 20 in ''Billboard'' magazine.

Between 2012 and 2017, Curb would release a series of unauthorized compilations of Williams' music. On April 17, 2012, Curb released a Williams album titled ''[[Long Gone Daddy]]'', marking the second album the company has released under his name since his departure. In April 2014, Curb Records released a new album under Hank Williams III's name titled ''Ramblin' Man''. The album contains previously unreleased material that Williams recorded while on their label. The following year, Curb released another Williams album of previously unreleased songs titled ''Take As Needed for Pain''. The album is mostly a rock album but the single released was a country song titled "Ruby Get Back to the Hills". On August 18, 2017, Curb released a ''Greatest Hits'' album featuring select tracks from Williams' first four albums, mostly from ''Straight to Hell''.

===Independent releases (2011–2014)===
[[File:Hank Williams III 2010 2b.jpg|thumb|right|Williams in 2010]]
On June 23, 2011, it was revealed through Williams' personal Facebook that he would be releasing four new CDs on September 6, 2011. It said to expect country, doom-rock, and speed metal with cattle callin' on the releases. Entitled ''[[Ghost to a Ghost/Gutter Town]]'' (a 2-disc country record with some ambient and folk influences), ''3 Bar Ranch Cattle Callin''' (a metal record in the newly anointed cattle core genre) and ''[[Attention Deficit Domination]]'' (a doom-rock record), these new albums were released on Williams's own record label Hank3 Records through [[Megaforce Records]], and feature guest appearances by [[Tom Waits]], [[Les Claypool]] ([[Primus (band)|Primus]]), Alan King (Hellstomper), Ray Lawrence Jr., Troy Medlin (Sourvein), Dave Sherman (Earthride) and Williams' dog, Trooper.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/hank3 |title=Hank 3 |publisher=Facebook |access-date=2011-09-14}}</ref>

On March 4, 2013, on Williams's web site, it was announced that he is working on two new albums. It has been confirmed that there are at least 25 new songs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hank3.com/news.html |title=The Official Website |publisher=Hank3 |access-date=2013-08-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009054457/http://hank3.com/news.html |archive-date=October 9, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On May 3, 2013, Williams released the names of two new albums: a country album ''[[Brothers of the 4×4]]'' and punk album ''A Fiendish Threat'', under the band name "3".

On January 1, 2013, it was announced that Williams was working on a new side project as well as the release of two new videos; one for ''Brothers of the 4x4'', the other for ''A Fiendish Threat''. The albums were released in the fall of 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hank3.com/news.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-08-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009054457/http://hank3.com/news.html |archive-date=October 9, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

On July 6, 2018, Williams was featured on [[DevilDriver]]'s cover of his song "Country Heroes", which appears on their album ''[[Outlaws 'til the End: Vol. 1]]''.

== Personal life ==
Saving Country Music reported in 2016 that Williams was forced to move out of his longtime home and headquarters, known as "The Haunted Ranch", and that his dog Trooper, who had been featured or referenced on a number of his songs, had died. His public appearances from that point onward became increasingly rare, and speculation emerged that an attempt at replacing the headquarters had been unsuccessful. Williams's last known public statement said that almost everything he owned had been taken from him, which prevented him from recording or touring, as the result of unnamed forces attempting a "systemic elimination of Hank3."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Trigger |title=Hank Williams III: "The Systematic Elimination of Hank3 Will Be Over Soon." |url=https://www.savingcountrymusic.com/hank-williams-iii-the-systematic-elimination-of-hank3-will-be-over-soon/ |website=Saving Country Music|date=March 2, 2018 }}</ref>

On March 7, 2021, it was confirmed that Williams' son, Coleman Finchum, would pursue a career in music under the name "IV" (to disambiguate from a different performer who uses the Hank Williams IV name, reputed to be Finchum's second cousin). His debut single, "Son of Sin", was released on April 20 with an LP to follow. Finchum plans on legally adopting the Williams surname as part of his entry into show business.<ref name=hank3sonIV>{{cite web |last1=Trigger |title=The Hank Williams Lineage Continues with Hank3's Son "IV" |url=https://www.savingcountrymusic.com/the-hank-williams-linage-continues-with-hank3s-son-iv/ |website=Saving Country Music|date=March 7, 2021 }}</ref>

== Music style ==

Williams' music is a mixture of traditional [[country music]], [[rockabilly]] and [[punk rock]].<ref name=Bisdeker/> His songs have been classified as country, [[cowpunk]]<ref name=Gilbert/><ref name=Wolcott/><ref name=Abbott/> and [[psychobilly]].<ref name=Gilbert/><ref name=Ollison/><ref name=Bisdeker/> They fuse the "tempo and structure of [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]]" with the "attitude and swagger of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]".<ref name=Hanover>{{cite web |url=https://spectrumculture.com/2012/07/02/rediscover-hank-iii-straight-to-hell/ |title=Rediscover: Hank III: Straight to Hell |last=Hanover |first=Nick |date=July 2, 2012  |publisher=Spectrum Culture |access-date=August 26, 2021}}</ref> Williams' lyrical themes include drug use, hedonism and the outlaw life, as well as criticism of the mainstream country music industry.<ref name=Hanover/><ref name=Deming>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/straight-to-hell-mw0000209869 |title=Straight to Hell |last=Deming |first=Mark  |publisher=Allmusic |access-date=August 26, 2021 }}</ref><ref name=Murray>{{cite web |url=https://www.avclub.com/hank-iii-straight-to-hell-1798201541/amp |title=Hank III: Straight To Hell |last=Murray |first=Noel |publisher=AV Club |access-date=August 26, 2021}}</ref>

Williams' live shows typically follow a [[Jekyll and Hyde]] format: a country music set featuring fiddle player David McElfresh and steel guitar player Dan Johnson, followed by a "hellbilly" set of cowpunk and psychobilly songs, and then an [[Assjack]] set, which consists of [[death metal]] and [[metalcore]] songs.<ref name=Jurek/>

The lineup for Assjack includes the addition of supplemental vocalist Gary Lindsey and the departure of his fiddle and steel guitar players. McElfresh's predecessor was fellow-fiddle-player Michael "Fiddleboy" McCanless, who would play all three sets, adding traditional violin for the country set of the concert before turning on different effect pedals for later sets. Fiddleboy died on February 1, 2003. Another former band member was guitarist [[Duane Denison]], previously with [[The Jesus Lizard]], who left The Damn Band and Assjack in January 2001 and later that year formed [[Tomahawk (band)|Tomahawk]].
