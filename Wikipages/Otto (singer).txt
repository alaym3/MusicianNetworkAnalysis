'''Otto Maximiliano Pereira de Cordeiro Ferreira''' (born June 28, 1968), known [[Mononymous person|mononymously]] as '''Otto''', is a Brazilian singer-songwriter, drummer, and television actor and presenter, famous for being one of the founding members of the pioneering [[Mangue Bit]] band [[Mundo Livre S/A]], of which he served as its drummer from 1984 to 1996.

==Early life and career==
Otto was born in [[Belo Jardim]], Pernambuco, on June 28, 1968, and is of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Native Brazilian]] descent.<ref>[http://www.dicionariompb.com.br/verbete.asp?tabela=T_FORM_A&nome=Otto Dicionário MPB: Otto] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015153906/http://www.dicionariompb.com.br/verbete.asp?tabela=T_FORM_A&nome=Otto |date=October 15, 2009 }} {{in lang|pt}}</ref> During his early teens he moved to [[Recife]], where he befriended [[Chico Science]] and [[Fred 04]]; with the latter he would form [[Mundo Livre S/A]], one of the first [[Mangue Bit]] bands ever alongside Science's [[Nação Zumbi]]. Otto provided drums for Mundo Livre S/A's first two studio albums, until leaving the band in 1996 to pursue a solo career.

In 1998 Otto released his first solo album, ''Samba pra Burro'', through independent record label Trama, which mixed traditional Brazilian genres such as ''[[samba]]'' and [[Música popular brasileira|MPB]] with [[electronica]], [[drum and bass]] and [[Hip hop music|rap]]. Produced by Apollo 9 and counting with guest appearances by [[Skowa]], [[Bebel Gilberto]], former Mundo Livre S/A bandmate Fred 04 and Erasto Vasconcelos (brother of [[Naná Vasconcelos]]), it received a good critical reception, and [[Pro-Música Brasil]] chose it as the best album of 1998. The album catapulted Otto into nationwide acclaim, later leading him to open shows for bands such as [[The Prodigy]] in the same year,<ref>[https://naopuloumafaixa.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/otto-samba-pra-burro/ Não Pulo uma Faixa (Otto – Samba pra Burro)] {{in lang|pt}}</ref> and in 1999 he played alongside [[Tom Zé]] at the Heineken Concerts in [[São Paulo]]. In 2000 a [[Remix album|remixed]] version of ''Samba pra Burro'' was released, also through Trama, entitled ''Changez Tout''.

Otto's subsequent album, ''Condom Black'', released in 2001, saw him advancing into a "more organic" sonority, in his words, but without abandoning the electronica influences. As with his previous album, ''Condom Black'' was also produced by Apollo 9. In the following year, he collaborated with [[synthpop]] band [[Metrô (band)|Metrô]] on their third album, ''[[Déjà-Vu (Metrô album)|Déjà-Vu]]''; he provided additional vocals for the album's title track.

Also in 2002 he made a contribution to the soundtrack of the critically acclaimed film ''[[Mango Yellow]]'' (alongside Jorge dü Peixe of Nação Zumbi and Fred 04). The following year saw the release of his third studio album, ''Sem Gravidade''.

in 2005 he made a guest appearance on the pilot episode of the TV series ''[[Mandrake (TV series)|Mandrake]]'' as Orlandinho.

In 2009 he released his fourth album, ''Certa Manhã Acordei de Sonhos Intranquilos'', his first not to come out through long-time label Trama. The album's title is an allusion to the opening line of [[Franz Kafka]]'s 1915 novella ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'', and counted with guest appearances by [[Céu]] and [[Julieta Venegas]], who later became one of Otto's major collaborators.

His fifth album, ''The Moon 1111'', was released in 2012 through [[Deckdisc]].

Since 2011 he also serves as co-host of the TV program ''Minha Vida É a Minha Cara'', alongside actress [[Hermila Guedes]], which is broadcast by [[FashionTV Brasil]].

In 2015 Otto announced on an interview to the newspaper ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'' that he began work on his sixth album, ''Ottomatopeia'', eventually released on July 28, 2017 through independent label Pomm_elo.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2015/06/1647716-otto-prepara-album-ottomatopeia-com-rock-e-melancolia.shtml|title=Otto prepara álbum ''Ottomatopeia'' com rock e melancolia|last=Balloussier|first=Anna Virgínia|date=June 26, 2015|publisher=[[Folha de S.Paulo]]|language=Portuguese|accessdate=29 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://miojoindie.com.br/resenha-ottomatopeia-otto/|title=Resenha: ''Ottomatopeia'', Otto|last=Facchi|first=Cleber|date=August 1, 2017|publisher=Miojo Indie|language=Portuguese|accessdate=15 August 2017}}</ref> It was elected the 14th best Brazilian album of 2017 by the Brazilian edition of ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.<ref name="rsbmelhores2017">{{cite web |title=Melhores Discos Nacionais de 2017 |url=https://rollingstone.uol.com.br/galeria/melhores-discos-nacionais-de-2017/|work=[[Rolling Stone]] Brasil |publisher=Grupo Spring de Comunicação |accessdate=January 25, 2019 |year=2017}}</ref>
