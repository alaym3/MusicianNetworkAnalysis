==Assault incident==
On January 22, 2014, Navarro was attacked and severely beaten by a group of men inside a condominium unit in [[Fort Bonifacio]], [[Taguig]], according to his manager, [[Chito S. Roño]]. Roño said Navarro was invited by a female friend named Deniece Cornejo to visit her condominium unit, where he was tied up and blindfolded by several men, threatened and then beaten up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/01/24/14/vhong-navarro-beaten-threatened-inside-fort-condo |title=Vhong Navarro beaten up, threatened inside Fort condo |publisher=ABS-CBN News |date=January 23, 2013 |access-date=January 25, 2014}}</ref> The perpetrator was identified as Cedric Lee, who was also accompanied by several other men during the time of the incident. Following this, it was stated that Navarro would temporarily not be appearing on ''[[It's Showtime (Philippine TV program)|It's Showtime]]'' and other television projects while he continues to recover.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/01/24/14/vice-ganda-vhongs-condition-nakakapanginig |title=Vice Ganda on Vhong's condition: Nakakapanginig |publisher=ABS-CBN News |date=January 23, 2013 |access-date=January 25, 2014}}</ref>

Navarro was accused of alleged attempted rape, which he did not accept. In an interview with TV host [[Boy Abunda]] on ''[[Buzz ng Bayan]]'', Navarro said he just arrived at the model's condo unit and then suddenly there were armed men that beat him up.<ref>{{cite web|last=Suerte |first=Cecille |url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2014/01/27/1283442/vhong-i-am-not-rapist-i-was-set |title=Vhong: I am a not rapist and will never be &#124; Headlines, News, The Philippine Star |work=The Philippine Star |date=November 13, 2013 |access-date=January 27, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.inquirer.net/131605/vhong-navarro-im-not-a-rapist |title=Vhong Navarro denies rape charge &#124; Inquirer Entertainment |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |access-date=January 27, 2014}}</ref> On January 29, 2014, one week after the incident, Cornejo filed a rape case against Navarro, but the National Bureau of Investigation said it was unlikely that there was an attempted rape on Cornejo, based on the [[CCTV]] footage.<ref>{{cite web|last=Carcamo |first=Dennis |url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/2014/01/29/1284353/nbi-no-attempt-rape-deniece |title=NBI: No attempt to rape Deniece &#124; Nation, News, The Philippine Star |work=The Philippine Star |date=November 13, 2013 |access-date=January 30, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/346067/news/metromanila/cctv-footage-appears-to-bolster-vhong-s-version-of-events |title=CCTV footage appears to bolster Vhong's version of events &#124; GMA News Online |publisher=Gmanetwork.com |access-date=January 30, 2014}}</ref>

The controversial incident had initially raised [[Me Too movement|ideologically motivated]] concerns over [[rape culture]] and [[victim blaming]], particularly surrounding the negative treatment of Cornejo, the [[False accusation of rape|supposed rape]] victim. Navarro earned himself sympathy from the public as himself a victim of [[defamation]] and [[physical violence]], whereas Cornejo faced the brunt of the public's ire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/01/29/14/anne-curtis-speaks-backs-vhong |title=Anne Curtis speaks up, backs Vhong |publisher=ABS-CBN News |access-date=February 26, 2014}}</ref> The public quickly dismissed the fact that Navarro willingly cheated on his girlfriend, Tanya Winona, with the unsuspecting Cornejo.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jansen Tumabing |url=http://amazingnews.ph/tanya-winona-bautistas-love-for-vhong-navarro-after-the-mauling-incident/ |title=Tanya Winona Bautista and Vhong Navarro after the mauling incident |publisher=Amazingnews.ph |date=February 9, 2014 |access-date=February 26, 2014}}</ref> Moreover, the public responded to Navarro's mauling by sending Cornejo death threats, and even more rape threats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/02/06/14/deniece-cornejo-high-spirits-despite-threats-calleja |title=Deniece Cornejo in high spirits despite 'threats' – Calleja |publisher=ABS-CBN News |access-date=February 26, 2014}}</ref> In an article posted on GMA News Online, Carljoe Javier expressed consternation with the treatment of the alleged rape of Cornejo:
<blockquote> "I understand that there are certain aspects of this case which raise possible opportunities for discussion. The most important point for discussion would be the way that we are now discussing rape. It’s disgusting how certain people have taken this as an opportunity to attempt to discredit rape victims as people who are just crying wolf. Many women are victims of sexual assault and sexual abuse and we must acknowledge this and attempt to prevent these terrible acts from happening. This is a truth regardless of the veracity of the claims of Deniece Cornejo." </blockquote>

When asked to explain her situation, Cornejo reported to the Inquirer and stated, "Victim blaming is a very common practice throughout the world especially for rape victims".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.inquirer.net/135160/deniece-cornejo-denies-being-an-escort |title=Deniece Cornejo denies being an escort &#124; Inquirer Entertainment |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=February 17, 2014 |access-date=February 26, 2014}}</ref>

On February 19, 2014, another rape case was filed against Navarro, by a woman named Roxanne Cabanero, alleging the rape took place in 2010.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Dumaual |first1=Miguel |title=Vhong Navarro a 'monster,' Roxanne claims |url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/02/21/14/vhong-navarro-monster-roxanne-claims |access-date=20 November 2020 |work=ABS-CBN News |date=21 February 2014}}</ref>

On March 8, 2014, Navarro made a return to ''It's Showtime''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/video/entertainment/03/08/14/watch-emotional-vhong-navarro-gives-speech-its-showtime |title=WATCH: Happy Vhong Navarro gives speech on 'It's Showtime because of support to his case even though he mean it' |publisher=ABS-CBN News |access-date=March 8, 2014}}</ref>

On April 10, 2014, [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|DOJ]] dismissed the rape complaint filed by Deniece Cornejo against Navarro.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/04/10/14/doj-junks-denieces-rape-case-vs-vhong |title=DOJ junks Deniece's rape case vs Vhong |publisher=ABS-CBN News |access-date=April 10, 2014}}</ref> A week later, DOJ issued a warrant of arrest against Cornejo and Lee. On April 26, Lee and his accomplice were captured and arrested in [[Oras, Eastern Samar]].<ref>[http://entertainment.inquirer.net/140608/cedric-lee-accomplice-nabbed-in-samar-police]</ref> On May 5, Cornejo surrendered to [[Camp Crame]].

On September 16, 2014, the Taguig court set a [[Philippine peso|PhP]] 500,000 bail for Lee, Raz and Cornejo.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.inquirer.net/152659/vhong-navarro-dismayed-by-court-ruling-for-bail-to-deniece-cornejo-et-al|title=Vhong Navarro dismayed by court ruling for bail to Deniece Cornejo et al|date=September 16, 2014 |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer}}</ref>

On January 25, 2015, businessman Ferdinand Guerrero was arrested by agents of the [[National Bureau of Investigation (Philippines)|National Bureau of Investigation]] (NBI) inside the penthouse of Ritz condominium in Makati as one of the suspects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/81998-ferdinand-guerrero-suspect-vhong-navarro-mauling-arrested |title=Suspect in Vhong Navarro mauling arrested |publisher=Rappler |date=January 26, 2015 |access-date=January 26, 2015}}</ref>
