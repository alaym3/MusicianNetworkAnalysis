'''Walter Anthony''' "'''Tony'''" '''Bradford''' (born March 3, 1989),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://judicial.peoriacounty.org/Portal/Home/WorkspaceMode?p=0|title = Peoria County Records Portal}}</ref> better known by his stage name '''Montana of 300''' (or simply '''Montana'''), is an American rapper, singer and songwriter from [[Peoria, Illinois]]. His debut [[studio album]], ''Fire in the Church'', was released on May 20, 2016. He is best known for his rap style, incorporating [[Trap music (hip hop)|trap]], [[R&B]], and [[drill (music genre)|drill]] beats, while also making remixes to hit songs that, like his originals, often include religious subtext.

Since releasing ''Fire in the Church,'' Montana has committed to releasing an album every year on May 20. The significance of the date is unknown. His third album, ''Don't Doubt the God'', was released on May 20, 2017, and his fourth album, ''Pray 4 the Devil'', was released on May 20, 2018, and his fifth album “A Gun In The Teacher’s Desk” on November 16, 2018, on May 20, 2019 Montana would later release his sixth album ''Views from the General's Helmet''. On February 18, 2020 Montana would release his EP mixtape titled “A Cold Day In Hell”. Montana planned to end his solo career with his final album titled “Rap God” which was set to be released in May 20, 2020 but was postponed due the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Early life==
Tony Bradford was born on March 3, 1989 in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. He has two brothers and three sisters.<ref name="Noisey">{{cite web|title=What Makes so Many People Listen to Montana of 300?|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/montana-of-300-interview-land-of-the-dark-video-premiere|work=[[Vice (magazine)#Website|Noisey]]|date=March 3, 2016|access-date=February 13, 2017}}</ref> He started rapping at age 15, and grew up listening to artists such as [[2Pac]], [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], [[Lil Wayne]] and [[Jay Z]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview: Montana of 300|url=http://www.factmag.com/2016/02/05/montana-of-300-interview/|work=[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]]|date=February 5, 2016|access-date=February 13, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Montana Of 300: 9 Albums That Changed My Life|url=http://read.tidal.com/article/montana-of-300-5-albums-that-changed-my-life|work=[[Tidal (service)|Tidal]]|date=March 21, 2016|access-date=February 13, 2017}}</ref> Both his parents suffered from serious substance abuse issues, his father from alcohol and his mother from crack cocaine.

In 2008, Montana, his friend from high school, Montelle Talley (known professionally as "Talley of 300"), as well as several others joined together to form the rap group "300". The name for the group was based on the [[300 (film)|movie of the same name]], in which a group of 300 Spartans overcome more than 300,000 Persian Soldiers to hold on to their territory. Montana was particularly inspired by the line, "No Surrender, No Retreat, Only the hard, only the strong, Against all odds".<ref>{{cite web|title=Montana of 300|url=http://www.hipwiki.com/Montana+Of+300|access-date=22 July 2016}}</ref>

In September 2015, Montana made a cameo appearance in the popular television show, ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Donaldson|first=Erich|title=Snitch B*tch: Empire's Fake Songs Are Becoming Real Hits|url=http://djbooth.net/news/entry/2015-10-01-petey-pablo-re-emerges-on-empire-writes-four-songs|access-date=22 July 2015}}</ref> In December 2015, Montana and Talley of 300 released a collaborative mixtape titled ''Gunz and Roses''.
