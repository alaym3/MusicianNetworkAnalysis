===2013–2014: Hiatus and reunion ===
On February 28, 2013 Legacy announced via Twitter that the group had been working on their third album for Warner Music Bros. Records.  However, on November 9, 2013, after many speculations that the group has gone their separate ways, member Earl "Ben J" Benjamin officially stated they have decided to split up in order to pursue solo careers.  He stated in an interview: "We've shared our talents with the world as a duo and had a very successful career in doing so, our songs stayed on the charts and our videos always received millions and millions of organic views on YouTube and Vevo. But after selling out shows and touring all over the world, we've decided that we'd like to share our talents with our fans individually. Together or apart; we've made our mark in American music history and our imprint will never be forgotten. I wish my brother (Legacy) the best in all that he does, and can’t wait till we're both at the Grammy's getting nominated for our solo efforts; and so begins a New chapter, in a New book; with this New Boy."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/the-new-boyz-officially-call-it-quits-news.8075.html|title=The New Boyz Officially Call It Quits|first=Kevin|last=Goddard|date=9 November 2013|work=HotNewHipHop|access-date=24 September 2015}}</ref> The group reunited in the 2014 film "[[School Dance (film)|School Dance]]".
