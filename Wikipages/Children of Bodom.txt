'''Children of Bodom''' was a [[melodic death metal]] band from [[Espoo]], [[Finland]]. Formed in 1993 as '''Inearthed''', the final line-up of the group upon their split in 2019 consisted of [[Alexi Laiho]] ([[lead guitar]], [[Lead vocalist|lead vocals]]), [[Jaska Raatikainen]] ([[Drum kit|drums]]), [[Henkka Seppälä]] ([[Bass guitar|bass]]), [[Janne Wirman]] ([[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s), and [[Daniel Freyberg]] ([[rhythm guitar]]). The band released ten studio albums, two live albums, two EPs, two compilation albums and one DVD.

The band's third studio album, ''[[Follow the Reaper]]'', was their first album to receive a [[music recording certification|gold certification]] in Finland, and subsequent studio albums acquired the same status. Their next four albums debuted at [[list of number-one albums (Finland)|number one]] on the [[The Official Finnish Charts|Finnish album charts]],<ref name="FIN">{{cite web| url=http://finnishcharts.com/search.asp?cat=a&search=Children+of+Bodom |title=Discography Children of Bodom |language=fi |publisher=Finnish charts |access-date=24 May 2009}}</ref> and have also seen chart positions on the United States [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. They are [[List of best-selling music artists in Finland|one of Finland's best selling artists of all time]] with more than 250,000 records sold there alone.

In 2019, Children of Bodom held their last concert in Helsinki named A Chapter Called Children of Bodom, before disbanding the band.

== History ==
{{More citations needed section|date=January 2021}}
=== Formation and early years (1993–1996) ===

Children of Bodom was formed in 1993 by guitarist [[Alexi Laiho|Alexi "Wildchild" Laiho]] and drummer [[Jaska Raatikainen]] under the name of '''Inearthed'''. They had known each other since early childhood and had shared an interest in heavy metal, especially [[death metal]] groups, such as [[Dissection (band)|Dissection]], [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]], [[Cannibal Corpse]], [[Autopsy (band)|Autopsy]], and [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]] and classic metal groups such as [[Iron Maiden]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[Metallica]], [[Dio (band)|Dio]], and [[Ozzy Osbourne]]. Bassist Samuli Miettinen completed the initial line-up of the band. Inearthed recorded its first [[Demo (music)|demo]], ''Implosion of Heaven'', during August of the same year.

[[File:Masters of Rock 2007 - Children of Bodom - Alexi Laiho - 08.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Lead guitarist and singer Alexi Laiho in 2007]]
Samuli was the main composer of the band's lyrics for the two years that he took part in Inearthed, but his family moved to the [[United States]] in 1995, making it impossible for him to remain in the band. His last contributions to Inearthed were the lyrics of the songs from their second demo, ''Ubiquitous Absence of Remission'' which was the first time they worked with producer [[Anssi Kippo]] at Astia-studios (Lappeenranta, Finland). In this demo, keyboards were incorporated into the band's songs for the first time. In order to achieve this, both Laiho and Raatikainen played the keyboards separately and subsequently mixed the recorded track with the other instruments. Laiho, who had previously only composed the melodies of the songs, assumed the role of the band's lyricist.

At the time, Raatikainen played [[French horn]] in a local big band, and during a rehearsal, he met [[Alexander Kuoppala]], a [[trumpet]] player and also a proficient guitarist. Shortly after the recording of their second demo, Kuoppala was invited to join Inearthed as a rhythm guitarist.

The bassist chosen to replace Samuli was Henkka "Blacksmith" Seppälä, whom Laiho and Raatikainen had previously known from school. Apart from playing the bass, Seppälä also often doubles as the band's backing vocalist. Also, the band recruited a musician to specialize on keyboards, whose name was Jani Pirisjoki. Both joined Inearthed in early 1996.

With this new line-up, Inearthed proceeded to record their third demo, entitled ''Shining''. This demo did not impress record labels any more than the previous ones had, and none took interest in the band.<ref name =cos-interview>{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/chats/1-207_children_of_bodom.aspx |title=CoC : Children of Bodom : Interview : 1/16/1999 |publisher=Chroniclesofchaos.com |access-date=6 November 2011}}</ref> Despite their efforts, their music got little exposure and managed only to play at local events. As a last resort, the band decided to record an independent, self-funded album.

Laiho wanted to make use of the keyboards more effectively, but Pirisjoki was not attending rehearsals. Thus, he was fired and replaced by a friend of Raatikainen's, a jazz pianist named Janne "Warman" Wirman.<ref name="cos-interview"/>

Wirman was the component which was previously missing from Inearthed. His presence allowed the band to assume the style which would later characterize Children of Bodom. With Wirman, the band successfully recorded their first album in 1997. Their debut, ''Something Wild'', was supposed to be released by a small Belgian label, Shiver Records, but second vocalist Sami Tenetz (from [[Thy Serpent]]) acquired a copy of their album through the hands of Kuoppala. They both worked for the same company at the time. Shortly after Inearthed signed this contract, [[Spinefarm Records]]' boss became interested in signing them for a country-wide release.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The latter deal was much more attractive to the band since the Belgian label was offering them close to no help, to the point where they would have to distribute and sell the album themselves.

The band was required to create a new name to sign up to Spinefarm Records. The contract with Shiver records had already been signed under the name of Inearthed. The answer to that problem came as the members looked for good names in their local phone book. When they stumbled upon [[Lake Bodom]], they realized that it was a name with impact and one which had an interesting story behind it. A long list of possible names involving the word Bodom was then made, and they settled with '''Children of Bodom'''. The band's name is derived from the [[Lake Bodom murders]].<ref name="Children Of Bodom FAQs">

''[[Something Wild (album)|Something Wild]]'' was produced, recorded and mixed by [[Anssi Kippo]] and Children of Bodom at Astia-studios (Lappeenranta, Finland). In an attempt to promote their band, they opened a show for [[Dimmu Borgir]] in 1997. Their success was such that a representative from the [[Nuclear Blast]] label approached them with a contract for a European release, a deal which started on the subsequent year.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} ''Something Wild'' was released in late 1997 in Finland and in 1998 worldwide. In early 1998, for promotional purposes, the band recorded a [[music video]] of the song "Deadnight Warrior". The video was directed by Mika Lindberg and had a slim budget of €1000. It made use of simple scenery, which consisted essentially of an outdoors location after a snowstorm. The band played for a couple of hours at night, with an average temperature of minus fifteen degrees Celsius.

Although Laiho is very critical of all of the music he has written, he notes that he dislikes ''Something Wild'' the most of all of his albums. When recording this album, Laiho had tried to mimic the style of one of his idols, [[Yngwie Malmsteen]], which is why ''Something Wild'' is considered one of the most technical albums Children of Bodom have produced.  Despite this, he still considers it to be their "most important" record, as it "put them on the map."

Children of Bodom's first European tour began in February 1998. They played with bands such as [[Hypocrisy (band)|Hypocrisy]] (at such festivals as Under the Black Sun), [[The Kovenant]] and [[Agathodaimon (band)|Agathodaimon]], but suffered from the absence of Wirman, who was concentrating on finishing his studies.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} He was replaced by pianist [[Erna Siikavirta]] for the duration of the tour.

Months later, the band recorded two new songs again at Astia-studios with producer [[Anssi Kippo]], entitled "Towards Dead End" and "Children of Bodom". The latter was included in a compilation by Spinefarm Records, which after being released remained on the top of Finnish charts for eight consecutive weeks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In late August, the band played the song "Forevermore" live for the first time during a show in Russia. This song was later renamed "Downfall".

Their second European tour occurred in September of that same year, but once more Wirman was not able to perform with them. Laiho's then-girlfriend [[Kimberly Goss]] (from [[Sinergy]] and formerly of [[Dimmu Borgir]], [[Ancient (band)|Ancient]] and [[Therion (band)|Therion]]) assumed the keyboards this time. By the end of the tour, Kimberly invited Laiho to join Sinergy, which at the time was still in its early stages.

The second album, ''[[Hatebreeder]]'', was recorded between the end of 1998 and the beginning of 1999 by [[Anssi Kippo]] at Astia-studios (Lappeenranta, Finland). It was originally entitled ''Towards Dead End'', but while in studio the members of the band opted for the current title. To create anticipation in Finland, the '"Downfall" single was released two weeks prior to the album's release. It was accompanied by a new music video, once more directed by Mika Lindberg. ''Hatebreeder'' ultimately topped the charts in many European countries. In July 1999, the success of the "[[Downfall (Children Of Bodom song)|Downfall]]" single and ''Hatebreeder'' allowed Children of Bodom to schedule three concerts in Japan with Sinergy and [[In Flames]]. During two of these concerts, the live album ''[[Tokyo Warhearts]]'' was recorded. In it the band managed to seamlessly reproduce and at times improve on their songs. At their request, no [[overdub]]s were used on the recording of the concert.

=== Rise to popularity: ''Follow the Reaper'' and ''Hate Crew Deathroll'' (2000–2003) ===
[[File:Jaska Raatikainen - Ilosaarirock 2009 2.jpg|thumb|[[Jaska Raatikainen]]]]
For their next release, Children of Bodom decided to make use of [[Peter Tägtgren]]'s Abyss studio in Sweden instead of the Finnish Astia-studio from [[Anssi Kippo]] where they had recorded all of their previous releases including the demos from Inearthed. The band wrote eight songs for the album. While in the studio, they decided to include an extra track that was hastily composed and featured lyrics improvised by Laiho; that track would eventually receive the name of "Kissing the Shadows". The band gave the album the name of ''[[Follow the Reaper]]'' and recording sessions took place between August and September 2000; the album saw a worldwide release in late 2000. A music video for "[[Everytime I Die]]" was recorded by the Finnish director Tuukka Temonen shortly after.

In February 2002, Children of Bodom began writing songs for their upcoming album, entitled ''[[Hate Crew Deathroll]]''. They returned to Astia-studio (Lappeenranta, Finland) to work with producer [[Anssi Kippo]] again. The session ensued during the months of August and September, and the album was released January 2003 in Finland. It remained on the top of the Finnish charts for a total of three weeks and subsequently became the band's first gold album. Eventually, all of the band's albums reached this status and ''Follow the Reaper'' reached platinum.

On 3 January 2003, the Finnish Metal Music Awards were held at [[Tavastia Club]] in Helsinki. Voting was open to all the metal fans and was presented through the various media outlets that were working with the event's organizers. Children of Bodom was awarded Finnish Band of the Year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=7129 |title=Metal News - Finnish Metal Music Awards 2003 Results ( Metal Underground . com ) |publisher=Metalunderground.com |access-date=22 July 2011}}</ref>

Children of Bodom's first world tour began in 2003 and lasted until late 2004. The tour had many sold-out concerts and marked the consolidation of the band in [[North America]], but was also accompanied by an unexpected announcement: Kuoppala decided to quit Children of Bodom for personal reasons right in the middle of the tour without giving previous warning. In an interview, when Laiho was asked why Kuoppala left the band, he stated that "Well, I try to be careful about what I say about him because there is no bad blood between us. He told me that he just got sick of touring and the whole band/rock 'n roll lifestyle living in hotels and tour buses and stuff. For me it was really weird because he was always the one who was SO into it! He was a die hard rock 'n roller and suddenly he made a quick 180 turn in his whole life. This whole situation involves a new girlfriend."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/ChildrenOfBodom-Sept2003.htm |title=Interview with Children of Bodom's Alexi Laiho |publisher=Metal-Rules.com |access-date=22 July 2011}}</ref> [[Griffin (band)|Griffin]]'s guitarist [[Kai Nergaard]] was invited by Laiho to replace Kuoppala, but did not accept the offer. Thus, Alexi's bandmate from Sinergy, [[Roope Latvala]] (founding member of [[Stone (band)|Stone]], one of the bands which started the heavy metal movement in Finland) assumed the guitars as a session player, until a more permanent solution could be found. This formation was introduced in [[Moscow]] on 16 August.

=== Breakthrough with ''Are You Dead Yet?'' (2004–2006) ===
[[File:Children of Bodom - Elbriot 2017 31.jpg|thumb|[[Janne Wirman]] ]]
After finishing the world tour with Latvala – who then assumed a permanent position in the band's line-up – Children of Bodom proceeded to record and release the [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Trashed, Lost & Strungout]]'' and the single "In Your Face", which contained songs from their upcoming album and a [[parody music|parody cover]] of "[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]" by [[Britney Spears]]. In late 2005, the album ''[[Are You Dead Yet?]]'' was released, featuring a style different from what had been presented by the band on its previous works. Simpler and heavier guitar [[riff]]s were incorporated into Children of Bodom's sound, as well as elements from [[industrial music]]. Reactions from fans to the release were varied; however, the album remains the band's most commercially successful. It was awarded gold status in Finland and reached first place on the Finnish charts, 16th in Germany, 16 in Sweden and 17 in Japan. The next release of the band was a DVD-single for the song "In Your Face", which included the music video, [[wiktionary:backstage|backstage]] footage from the band and a live recording of the song "Sixpounder" at Wacken Open Air festival in 2004. In June, Children of Bodom was in front of 120,000 spectators, one of their biggest concerts, on the last concert of the [[Böhse Onkelz]]. The DVD of the concert, called [[Vaya Con Tioz]], includes Children of Bodom's performance of "Everytime I Die".

Children of Bodom's [[live album|live]] DVD ''[[Stockholm Knockout Live|Chaos Ridden Years - Stockholm Knockout Live]]'' was released on 5 December 2006. It contains a recording of a live concert performed on 5 February 2006 in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, with over 90 minutes of live footage. "Chaos Ridden Years" refers to a documentary featuring interviews with band members about the history of the band and footage of the band on tour. It also contains every [[music video]] Children of Bodom has made, except for "Needled 24/7". Guitarist Alexi Laiho was voted world's best guitarist of 2006 by [[Metal Hammer]] magazine.

In June 2006, the band embarked on one of their biggest tours: [[The Unholy Alliance (tour)|The Unholy Alliance]] tour, playing alongside [[Slayer]], [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]], [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]], [[In Flames]] and [[Thine Eyes Bleed]]. The bands toured the US through June and July, and Europe through October and November.

On 31 January 2007, Laiho slid down the lane at a bowling alley after accidentally stepping over the foul line. He slammed hard into the wall, breaking his left shoulder. This rendered him unable to play guitar for six weeks. Due to this incident, Children of Bodom was forced to cancel their first 2007 tours, and a festival that they were slated to headline.

On 31 March 2007, the band's website released information on Laiho's condition stating that while Laiho's injury will never fully heal, it no longer affects his ability to play the guitar. The same notice also stated that the band had already written some songs for a new album and would start recording sometime later in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cobhc.com |title=Children of Bodom Hate Crew Official Website &#124; The Ugly World Tour 2011 |publisher=Cobhc.com |access-date=22 July 2011}}</ref>

After the ''Blooddrunk'' tour ended, Children of Bodom started recording their new album. During the recording of the drum tracks there was a small tornado and the power was cut out.

The three track names they released were entitled: "Pussyfoot Miss Suicide", "Ugly", and "Was It Worth It?"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jorzine.com/default.aspx?Page=intNews&ID=1850&month=10&year=2010 |title=CHILDREN OF BODOM New Song titles Revealed |publisher=Jorzine.com |access-date=6 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713120535/http://www.jorzine.com/default.aspx?Page=intNews&ID=1850&month=10&year=2010 |archive-date=13 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cobhc.com/index.php?id=news |title=Children of Bodom Hate Crew Official Website |publisher=www.cobhc.com |access-date=26 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120155242/http://cobhc.com/index.php?id=news |archive-date=20 November 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
