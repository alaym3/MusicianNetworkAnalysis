'''Worry''' refers to the thoughts, images, [[emotions]], and actions of a [[Pessimism|negative nature]] in a repetitive, uncontrollable manner that results from a proactive cognitive risk analysis made to avoid or [[Problem solving|solve]] anticipated potential threats and their potential consequences.<ref>[http://www.personal.kent.edu/~dfresco/mindfulness/CPSP_borkovec.pdf Borkovec TD. (2002). Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice 9, 76–80.]</ref>

== Introduction ==
[[File:Worried little girl.jpg|thumb|left|130px|A young girl looking worried]]
Psychologically, worry is part of
[[Perseverative Cognition]] (a collective term for continuous thinking about negative events in the past or in the future).<ref name="BPT2005">{{cite journal | vauthors = Brosschot JF, Pieper S, Thayer JF | title = Expanding stress theory: prolonged activation and perseverative cognition | journal = Psychoneuroendocrinology | volume = 30 | issue = 10 | pages = 1043–1049 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 15939546 | doi = 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2005.04.008 }}</ref> As an [[emotion]] "worry" is experienced from [[anxiety]] or concern about a real or imagined issue, often personal issues such as health or finances, or external broader issues such as environmental pollution, social structure or technological change. It is a natural response to anticipated future problems. Excessive worry is a primary diagnostic feature of [[generalized anxiety disorder]]. Most people experience short-lived periods of worry in their lives without incident; indeed, a mild amount of worrying have positive effects, if it prompts people to take precautions (e.g., fastening their [[seat belt]] or buying insurance) or avoid [[risk]]y behaviors (e.g., angering dangerous animals, or [[binge drinking]]), but with excessive worrisome people they overestimate future dangers in their assessments and in its extremities tend to [[Exaggeration|magnify]] the situation as a dead end which results stress. Overestimation happens because analytic resources are a combination of external [[locus of control]], personal experience and belief fallacies. Chronically worried individuals are also more likely to lack confidence in their problem solving ability, perceive problems as threats, become easily frustrated when dealing with a problem, and are pessimistic about the outcome of problem-solving efforts.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bredemeier K, Berenbaum H | title = Intolerance of uncertainty and perceived threat | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 28–38 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17983612 | doi = 10.1016/j.brat.2007.09.006 }}</ref>

Seriously anxious people find it difficult to control their worry and typically experience symptoms like restlessness, fatigue, difficulty in concentrating, irritability, muscle tension and sleep disturbance.

== Theories ==
{{Mental state}}

=== Avoidance model ===
The avoidance model of worry (AMW) theorizes that worry is a verbal linguistic, thought based activity, which arises as an attempt to inhibit vivid mental imagery and associated somatic and emotional activation.<ref>{{Cite book| vauthors = Borkovec TD, Alcaine OM, Behar E |title=Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Advances in Research and Practice|publisher=Guilford Press|year=2004|pages=77–108}}</ref> This inhibition precludes the emotional processing of fear that is theoretically necessary for successful [[habituation]] and extinction of feared stimuli.<ref>{{Cite book|pages = 27–43|doi = 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199735969.003.0017| vauthors = Gillihan SJ, Foa EB |title = Associative Learning and Conditioning Theory|year = 2011|isbn = 9780199735969}}</ref> Worry is reinforced as a coping technique due to the fact that most worries never actually occur, leaving the worrier with a feeling of having successfully controlled the feared situation, without the unpleasant sensations associated with exposure.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Behar E, DiMarco ID, Hekler EB, Mohlman J, Staples AM | title = Current theoretical models of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD): conceptual review and treatment implications | journal = Journal of Anxiety Disorders | volume = 23 | issue = 8 | pages = 1011–1023 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19700258 | doi = 10.1016/j.janxdis.2009.07.006 }}</ref>

=== Cognitive model ===
This model explains pathological worry to be an interaction between involuntary (bottom-up) processes, such as habitual biases in attention and interpretation favoring threat content, and voluntary (top-down) processes, such as attentional control. Emotional processing biases influence the probability of threat representations into the awareness as intruding negative or positive thoughts. At a pre-conscious level, these processes influence the competition among mental representations in which some correspond to the assertive power of worry with impaired cognitive process and others to the preventive power of worry with attentional control or exhaustive vigilance. The biases determine threatening degree and nature of worry content the worrier attempts to resolve the perceived threat and the redirection of anticipations, responses and coping in such situations.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hirsch CR, Mathews A | title = A cognitive model of pathological worry | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 50 | issue = 10 | pages = 636–646 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22863541 | pmc = 3444754 | doi = 10.1016/j.brat.2012.06.007 }}</ref>

There are some who respond to mental representations in an uncertain or ambiguous state in regard to the stressful or upsetting event.<ref>{{Cite book|title = A Cognitive Model of Generalized Anxiety Disorder: the Role of Intolerance of Uncertainty|publisher = John Wiley & Sons Ltd|date = 2006-01-01|isbn = 9780470713143|pages = 201–216|doi = 10.1002/9780470713143.ch12| vauthors = Koerner N, Dugas MJ | veditors = Davey GC, Wells A }}</ref> In this state the worrier is held in a perpetual state of worry. This is because availability of an overwhelming number(maybe 2 or 3, depending upon the worry-prone individual) of possibilities of outcomes which can be generated, it puts the worrier in a threatening crisis and they focus their attentional control voluntarily on the potential negative outcomes, whereas others engage in a constructive problem solving manner and in a benign approach rather than to engage with heightened anticipation on the possible negative outcome.<ref>{{Cite book|publisher = John Wiley & Sons Ltd|date = 2013-01-01|isbn = 9781118330043|pages = [https://archive.org/details/cbtforanxietydis0000unse/page/57 57–85]|doi = 10.1002/9781118330043.ch3| vauthors = Robichaud M | veditors = Simos G, Hofmann SG |title = CBT for Anxiety Disorders|chapter = Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Targeting Intolerance of Uncertainty|chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/cbtforanxietydis0000unse/page/57}}</ref>

==Philosophical perspectives==
Greek thinkers such as [[Stoicism|stoic]] [[philosopher]] [[Epictetus]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] advised against worry. [[Albert Ellis]], the creator of [[Rational emotive behavior therapy|Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy]], was inspired by the Stoics’ therapeutic ideas.<ref>{{cite web | vauthors = Evans J | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/wellbeing/10146546/Anxious-Depressed-Try-Greek-philosophy.html | title = Anxious?

==Religious perspectives ==
[[Image:Guido Reni 040.jpg|thumb|right|[[Guido Reni]]'s 17th-century painting of [[John the Baptist]] depicts anguish and worry.]]
The [[Hebrew Bible|biblical]] word used in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for worry ({{lang-he|דָּאַג}}, ''{{transl|he|daag}}'') regards worry as a combined form of fear and sorrow which affects [[nephesh]], the totality of our being. The bible takes a fortitude-strengthening approach regarding worrying e.g. [[Psalm 94]]:
:''In the multitude of my anxieties within me, your comforts delight my soul.''<ref>{{bibleverse||Psalms|94:19|NKJV}}</ref>

In the [[New Testament]], the [[Gospel of Matthew]] encourages:
:''And can any of you by worrying add a single hour to your span of life? ... So do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring worries of its own. Today’s trouble is enough for today.''<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|6:27,34|NKJV}}</ref>

The Greek word used for worry in Matthew is ''merimnaō'',<ref>{{cite web |title=Is Worry a Sin? |url=https://www.christianityunfiltered.com/is-worrying-a-sin/ |website=Christianity Unfiltered}} Retrieved 2019-10-29.</ref> which means to be anxious about, or to be troubled with cares.

St. Paul writes to the [[Philippi]]an church, "There is no need to worry"<ref>Philippians 4:6 - [[Jerusalem Bible]]</ref> and in the [[pastoral epistles]], 2 Timothy 1:7 emboldens:
:''For [[God]] did not give us a spirit of [[cowardice]], but rather a spirit of power and of love and of [[self-discipline]].''
Similarly [[Epistle of James|James]] 1:2-4 motivates to face trials of any kind with joy, because they produce endurance (strength and courage). Further [[Saint Peter]] reveals his understanding of healthy living in [[Second Peter]] 1:3,5–7:
:''We have a sure hope ... this is a cause of great joy for us.''<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/versions/New-Revised-Standard-Version-NRSV-Bible/ "New Revised Standard Version"] Retrieved on 2015-01-17</ref>

A late [[India]]n spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] stated that worry is caused by desires and can be overcome through detachment:
:''Worry is the product of feverish imagination working under the stimulus of desires ... (It) is a necessary resultant of attachment to the past or to the anticipated future, and it always persists in some form or other until the mind is completely detached from everything.''<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Baba M | author-link1 = Meher Baba|title=Discourses |date=1995 |publisher=Sheriar Foundation |location=Myrtle Beach, S.C., U.S.A. |isbn=978-1-880619-09-4 | volume = 3 | pages = 121–122}}</ref>

== Management ==
The worry system is activated from exposure to a potential triggering event, traumatic experience or vulnerability, this brings worrisome thoughts and feelings which bring about physical stress reactions and response to avoid worrisome behavior, to ensure [[allostasis]]. But under the crisis this activity feeds back into the first worrisome thoughts and feelings which generates and [[Conditioned emotional response|strengthens]] the vicious worry cycle. Relaxation, risk assessment, worry exposure and behavior prevention have been proven effective in curbing the excessive worry, a chief feature of generalized anxiety disorder.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = O'Leary TA, Brown TA, Barlow DH | chapter = The efficacy of worry control treatment in generalized anxiety disorder: A multiple baseline analysis. | title = Meeting of the Association for Advancement of Behavior Therapy | location = Boston | date = 1992 }}</ref> Cognitive behavioral techniques hasn't branched out enough to address the problem holistically but therapy can control or diminish worry.<ref name="Zinbarg_1992">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zinbarg RE, Barlow DH, Brown TA, Hertz RM | title = Cognitive-behavioral approaches to the nature and treatment of anxiety disorders | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 235–67 | date = 1992 | pmid = 1539944 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ps.43.020192.001315 }}</ref>
