'''New Radicals''' (stylized as '''Иew Radicals''') were an American [[alternative rock]] band formed in 1997 in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. The band was centered on frontman [[Gregg Alexander]], who [[songwriter|wrote]] and [[record producer|produced]] all of their songs. The band's only other permanent member was keyboardist and percussionist [[Danielle Brisebois]].

The band released only one album, 1998's ''[[Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too]]'', an alternative rock album heavily influenced by the [[rock music|rock]] and [[soul music|soul]] of the 1970s,<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r379720|pure_url=yes}}|title=Allmusic Guide Review of "Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too"}}</ref> containing—among radio-friendly [[modern rock]] tracks and [[love song]]s—strong criticism of corporate America.<ref name="Misunderstood">{{cite web | url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/513079/03251999/new_radicals.jhtml|title=New Radicals Song Misunderstood, Singer Says|work=VH1.com|access-date=August 6, 2005}}</ref><ref name="Watch">{{cite journal | author=Austin Clarke | title=It's the End of the World as We Know It (and New Radicals are going to kick your a$$?!?) | journal=Watch | year=1999 | issue=Winter '99 | pages= 16–18}}</ref> The band is known for their debut [[single (music)|single]] "[[You Get What You Give (song)|You Get What You Give]]".

Tired of touring and promotional interviews, Alexander disbanded the group in mid-1999 before the release of their second single, "[[Someday We'll Know]]", to focus on writing and producing songs for other artists. Alexander and Brisebois' songwriting partnership continued following the disbanding of the group, with the two being nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] in 2015 for their composition "[[Lost Stars]]" from the film ''[[Begin Again (film)|Begin Again]]''.

Since their disbandment, the group has received numerous offers for a reunion tour or new album, but Alexander has repeatedly turned these down. However, the band finally reunited for a one off performance on January 20, 2021, at President [[Joe Biden]]'s [[2021 presidential inauguration|presidential inauguration]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Carr|first=Debbie|date=2021-01-18|title=New Radicals to reform after 22 years for Joe Biden’s Inauguration|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/new-radicals-to-reform-after-22-years-for-joe-bidens-inauguration-2858822|access-date=2021-01-21|website=NME|language=en-GB}}</ref>

==Members==
New Radicals had a "revolving-door policy" and no permanent members other than Gregg Alexander, who produced, wrote, sang and played various instruments for the band. The only other person considered a relatively constant member was former [[child actor|child actress]] [[Danielle Brisebois]] (''[[All in the Family]]'', ''[[Archie Bunker's Place]]'').<ref>{{cite video |people=[[Danielle Brisebois]] (Interviewee) |date=2002 |url=http://www.tv.com/one-hit-wonders/vh1s-100-greatest-one-hit-wonders-hour-2/episode/291769/summary.html |title=VH1's 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders |medium=TV-Series |location=North America |publisher=[[VH1]]}}</ref> She acted as background singer, keyboardist and [[percussion instrument|percussionist]] on the album, at live shows and in the band's [[music video]]s. She also co-wrote their second single "Someday We'll Know" with Alexander and Debra Holland. Brisebois had previously worked with Alexander on his 1992 album ''[[Intoxifornication]]'' and on her 1994 solo debut ''[[Arrive All Over You]]'', and was concurrently working with him on her solo album ''[[Portable Life]]'' at the time (which was not officially released until 2008).

Most of the musicians who worked on ''Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too'' were friends of Alexander and Brisebois, including [[pianist|piano player]] [[Paul Gordon (musician)|Paul Gordon]], [[drum kit|drummer]]s Matt Laug and [[Josh Freese]], [[Paul McCartney]]'s [[guitar]]ist [[Rusty Anderson]], guitarist [[Michael James (producer)|Michael James]] (who also mixed),  [[bassist]]s Paul Bushnell, Dan Rothchild  and [[John Pierce (musician)|John Pierce]], percussionist Lenny Castro, pianist [[Greg Phillinganes]], and producer [[Rick Nowels]], who played [[piano]] on two tracks on the album (and who had previously produced Alexander's debut album ''[[Michigan Rain]]''). 

Other musicians who were at some point part of the live line-up include drummer Stuart Johnson, guitarist [[Brad Fernquist|Bradley Fernquist]], keyboardist [[Jim McGorman]] and [[bass guitar|bassist]] Sasha Krivtsov. The latter two were later also part of the [[house band]] in ''[[Rock Star: INXS]]''. Sasha and Jim also played with [[Kiss (band)|KISS]]' [[Paul Stanley]] on his "Live To Win" solo tour in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rockstar.msn.com/show/houseband |title=Rock Star: INXS The House Band |publisher=MSN.com |access-date=December 8, 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214042409/http://rockstar.msn.com/show/houseband |archive-date=December 14, 2005 }}</ref>

==History==

===Rise to mainstream fame===
New Radicals were formed in [[Los Angeles, California]], in 1997 by Gregg Alexander, who had previously released two unsuccessful solo albums, 1989's ''[[Michigan Rain]]'' and 1992's ''[[Intoxifornication]]''. Michael Rosenblatt, [[MCA Records]]' [[A&R]] Senior Vice President, signed the band to the label in 1998,<ref>{{cite web |author=Laskow, Michael |url=http://www.taxi.com/faq/ar/rosenblatt.html |title=Michael Rosenblatt Sr. Vice President, A&R MCA Records |publisher=taxi.com |access-date=January 1, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107110147/http://taxi.com/faq/ar/rosenblatt.html |archive-date=January 7, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and Alexander received a $600,000 advance for their first (and only) album, ''Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Christgau, Robert |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/music/scnewrad-98.php |title=The Sound of the City |work=[[Village Voice]] |date=December 22, 1998 |access-date=August 6, 2005}}</ref> The album was released on October 20, 1998, and was well received by music critics, who praised the record for its wide range of atypical influences for a modern [[pop rock]] album, such as [[Todd Rundgren]], [[World Party]] and [[Hall & Oates]], and compared its funk and soul-influenced [[upbeat]] pop rock to the early work of [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[Mick Jagger]].

Some critics disliked the album's themes, dismissing Alexander's criticism of society and the frequent references to [[recreational drug use|drugs]] and [[sexual intercourse|sex]] that run throughout the album as "shallow posturing" and "empty social pronouncements",<ref>{{cite web |author=Wright, Rickey |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000DF6J/ |title=Editorial Reviews: Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too |work=[[Amazon.com]] |access-date=August 6, 2005}}</ref> while others stated that these criticisms "would sound clichéd if they {{sic|werent}}<!-- DO NOT CORRECT THIS, [sic] indicates it is a letter-for-letter quote --> so insightful and articulated with such uninhibited truth."<ref>{{cite web

</ref> Popular opinion, by contrast, pushed the album to No.&nbsp;10 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and No.&nbsp;41 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in the U.S., where it also achieved [[RIAA certification|platinum]] status (1,000,000 copies sold). It was also certified [[British Phonographic Industry#Certifications|gold in the United Kingdom]] (100,000 copies sold) and [[Canadian Recording Industry Association#Album certifications|in Canada]] (50,000 copies sold).

===''Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too''===
{{main|Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too}}
To promote their album, New Radicals embarked on a tour through the United States, starting in late 1998. Apart from many concerts and festivals, the tour also included several live performances on the radio, appearances on ''[[The Tonight Show|The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' and [[Nickelodeon]]'s ''[[All That]]'' and a performance at the [[House of Blues]] in [[Chicago]] on [[New Year's Eve]] 1998—which is probably the only New Radicals show of which [[bootleg recording|bootlegs]] are circulating.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041031171737/http://www.hitmanscorner.com/others/newradicals_live.htm The New Radicals.] The Hitman's Corner. Accessed on October 5, 2005</ref> They also opened for the [[Goo Goo Dolls]] on their tour starting on March 30, 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429613/19990201/story.jhtml |title=Goo Goo Dolls Tap New Radicals For Charitable Tour |work=MTV.com |access-date=August 6, 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050108020426/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429613/19990201/story.jhtml |archive-date=January 8, 2005 }}</ref>

The album was followed on November 17, 1998, by the release of their first single, "[[You Get What You Give (song)|You Get What You Give]]" (co-written with [[Rick Nowels]]), which reached No.&nbsp;36 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], No.&nbsp;5 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], and No.&nbsp;1 on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Canadian Singles Chart. The song received heavy radio [[airplay (song)|airplay]] and rotation on [[MTV]] and much media attention. In large part this attention focused on the celebrity-slamming line "Fashion shoots with [[Beck]] and [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]] / [[Courtney Love]] and [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] / You're all fakes run to your mansions / Come around we'll kick your ass in."

When asked about it in an interview, Marilyn Manson replied he was "not mad that [Alexander] said he'd kick my ass, I just don't want to be used in the same sentence with Courtney Love" and would "crack his skull open if I see him."<ref name="MTV" /> Beck reported that "I was in a grocery store and he [Alexander] came running up to me, so apologetic, and saying, 'I hope you weren't offended. It wasn't supposed to be personal.' I was kind of pleased, because he's a big guy."<ref name="Beck" /> The members of Hanson said they weren't really bothered by the song, as they saw it as just a pop-culture reference. They also co-wrote the song "Lost Without Each Other" from their 2004 album ''[[Underneath (Hanson album)|Underneath]]'' with Alexander. [[Zac Hanson]] said that "It was cool working with Gregg... [he]'s definitely a character but he's a cool guy."<ref>{{cite news |last=Fuoco |first=Christina |title=liveDaily Interview: Zac Hanson of Hanson |url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/6813.html?t=98 |publisher=Live Daily News |date=July 19, 2004 |access-date=2005-12-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040811141102/http://www.livedaily.com/news/6813.html?t=98 |archive-date=August 11, 2004 }}</ref>

Following the mass media's excitement about the celebrity insults, Alexander explained that the verse, along with the lines directly preceding it ("Health insurance rip off lying / [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] big bankers buying / Fake computer crashes dining / Cloning while they're multiplying") were an experiment to see if the media would focus on the real issues, or on the celebrity ridicule.<ref name="Misunderstood" /> Similar complaints and attacks on [[Christianity|Christian religion]], American society, politics and corporations can be found in other songs on the album as well, and Alexander would often use promotional interviews to talk about these topics, complaining about—among other things—corrupt, greedy politicians and [[corporate title|corporate officer]]s, [[credit card interest]], the poor American [[Social Security (United States)|social security system]], and lack of education.<ref name="Watch" />

The drums on the album's title track were sampled from the [[XTC]] song 'All of a Sudden' (from their ''[[English Settlement]]'' album). According to XTC's songwriter [[Andy Partridge]], the sample was used without permission; and the band and its record company eventually received £70,000 in compensation for its use.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

===Breakup and post–New Radicals===
When the band canceled their appearance at the [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] open-air music festival RockFest, as well as their UK tour (scheduled to start on May 17, 1999), rumors started they would break up, while MCA Records claimed an unspecified member of the band being ill was the cause for the canceled shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1432630/19990519/story.jhtml |title=New Radicals Cancel RockFest Appearance |work=MTV.com |access-date=August 6, 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523095955/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1432630/19990519/story.jhtml |archive-date=May 23, 2006 }}</ref> New Radicals went on to shoot the video for their second single "[[Someday We'll Know]]"; however, less than two weeks before its release, Gregg Alexander issued a press release on July 12, announcing the breakup of the group. Alexander said that New Radicals "will no longer be a recording, promoting, or performing entity" and that he would focus on producing and writing material for other artists. He went on to say that he "accomplished all of [his] goals with this record" and that "the fatigue of traveling & getting three hours sleep in a different hotel every night to do boring 'hanging and schmoozing' with radio and retail people, is definitely not for [him]", that he "lost interest in fronting a '[[one-hit wonder|One Hit Wonder]]' to the point that [he] was wearing a hat while performing so that people wouldn't see [his] lack of enthusiasm" and that he would go on to form a production company to focus on producing and writing songs freelance for other artists.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=49834 |title = New Radicals Dissolves |date=July 12, 1999 |access-date=2005-08-06}}</ref> His first production work after New Radicals' breakup was the album ''[[Portable Life]]'' by fellow Radical Danielle Brisebois, originally set to be released in October 1999, but cancelled by [[RCA Records]] until eventually being released digitally almost a decade later in September 2008. Given the band's breakup and the resulting lack of promotion, "Someday We'll Know" failed to have a notable impact on the charts (it did not chart the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and reached only No.&nbsp;28 on the U.S. [[Adult Top 40]] and No.&nbsp;48 on the UK Singles Chart)

Although no third single was released, there are some (conflicting) clues as to what would have been the third single: certain promotional copies of ''Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too'' come with a sticker reading "includes 'You Get What You Give', 'I Don't Wanna Die Anymore' and 'Someday We'll Know'",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.new-radicals.com/promo/FullAlbum.htm |title=Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too with promo sticker |publisher=new-radicals.com |access-date=February 18, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205500/http://www.new-radicals.com/promo/FullAlbum.htm |archive-date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref> suggesting that "I Don't Wanna Die Anymore" would join the other two as a single release. Several websites selling the album also marked the track as "Album Version", indicating that there would be a single version at some point.<ref>[http://music.msn.com/album/default.aspx?album=10334837 Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311132012/http://music.msn.com/album/default.aspx?album=10334837 |date=2007-03-11 }} msn.com. Retrieved on October 28, 2005.</ref> However, there also exist copies of "Mother We Just Can't Get Enough" as both a one-track [[promotional single]]<ref>[http://eil.com/shop/moreinfo.asp?catalogid=311851 NEW RADICALS Mother We Just Can't Get Enough.] eil.com. Retrieved on October 5, 2005</ref> and as a four-track commercial single with a barcode.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.new-radicals.com/official/155%20641-2.htm |title=Mother We Just Can't Get Enough single |publisher=new-radicals.com |access-date=February 10, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205454/http://www.new-radicals.com/official/155%20641-2.htm |archive-date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref> These apparently never made it to retail and were probably test pressings.

In addition to the songs released on the United States version of ''Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too'', two studio songs by New Radicals were produced. The song "To Think I Thought" was included as the B-side to "You Get What You Give" and as an additional track on the Japanese version of the album, and "The Decency League" was a B-side to the single "Someday We'll Know".

In the years following New Radicals' breakup, Alexander worked with artists such as [[Ronan Keating]], [[Sophie Ellis-Bextor]] and [[Enrique Iglesias]], often collaborating with producer/songwriter [[Rick Nowels]]. His most successful song as a producer/songwriter was the [[Grammy Awards of 2003|2003 Grammy Award]]-winning "[[The Game of Love (Santana song)|The Game of Love]]" by [[Carlos Santana|Santana]] and [[Michelle Branch]]. [[Rod Stewart]] also recorded Alexander and Nowels' "I Can't Deny It" for his 2001 album ''[[Human (Rod Stewart album)|Human]]''.

In 2003, a new Gregg Alexander song entitled "[[A Love Like That]]" was released at PickTheHits.com, a website where users could rate new music. While it was uncredited, fans immediately recognized Alexander's voice and parts of the lyrics that had already appeared in the booklet for ''Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too''. The song was (as official sites listing Alexander's song repertoire reveal) written by Alexander and Rick Nowels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emimusicpub.com/worldwide/servlet/lyrics?song_id=2281331 |title="A Love Like That" Song Details |work=EMI Music Publishing |access-date=May 13, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927025346/http://www.emimusicpub.com/worldwide/servlet/lyrics?song_id=2281331 |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Since their breakup, New Radicals' songs have been used for several commercials and trailers (for example the trailer to 1999's ''[[Big Daddy (1999 film)|Big Daddy]]'' with [[Adam Sandler]], the 2001 film ''[[Bubble Boy (film)|Bubble Boy]]'', and the 2006 film ''[[Click (2006 film)|Click]]''), TV shows (like ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'', ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]'', ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', and ''[[Daria]]''), on soundtracks (such as ''[[A Walk to Remember (film)|A Walk to Remember]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed]]'', ''Click'' and ''[[Surf's Up (film)|Surf's Up]]'') and covered by artists such as [[Mandy Moore]] and [[Jon Foreman]] (lead singer of [[Switchfoot]]) and [[Hall & Oates]] (both covered "Someday We'll Know" – Moore and Foreman on the soundtrack to ''A Walk to Remember'', Hall & Oates on their 2003 album ''[[Do It for Love (Hall & Oates album)|Do It For Love]]''). Ronan Keating also covered the song during his 2002 Destination Everywhere tour and included "You Get What You Give" in his [[celebrity playlist]] on [[iTunes Music Store|iTunes]], as did [[Joni Mitchell]] on her ''Artist's Choice'' CD, released by [[Starbucks]]' [[Hear Music]]. She also declared New Radicals "the only thing I heard in many years that I thought had greatness in it... I loved that song 'You Get What You Give.' It was a big hit, and I said, 'Where did they go?' It turns out the guy [Gregg Alexander] quit. I thought, 'Good for him.'
