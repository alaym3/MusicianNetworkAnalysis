'''Alexander David Turner''' (born 6 January 1986) is an English musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer. He is best known as the frontman and principal songwriter of the rock band [[Arctic Monkeys]], with whom he has released six albums. He has also recorded with his side project [[The Last Shadow Puppets]] and as a solo artist.

When Turner was 16, he and three friends formed Arctic Monkeys in their native [[Sheffield]]. Their debut album, ''[[Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not]]'' (2006), became the fastest-selling debut album in British history and was ranked at No. 30 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'s}} list of the greatest debut albums of all time,<ref>{{cite news |title=100 Best Debut Albums of All Time |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-100-greatest-debut-albums-of-all-time-20130322/whatever-people-say-i-am-that-s-what-i-m-not-19691231 |access-date=27 July 2018 |work=Rolling Stone |date=22 March 2013}}</ref> with the single "[[I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor]]" becoming a UK number-one hit. The band's subsequent studio albums, ''[[Favourite Worst Nightmare]]'' (2007), ''[[Humbug (album)|Humbug]]'' (2009), ''[[Suck It and See]]'' (2011), ''[[AM (Arctic Monkeys album)|AM]]'' (2013) and ''[[Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino]]'' (2018), have experimented with [[Palm Desert Scene|desert rock]], indie pop, R&B, and [[lounge music]]. Arctic Monkeys headlined [[Glastonbury Festival]] in both 2007 and 2013, and performed during the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|2012 London Summer Olympics opening ceremony]].

As the co-frontmen of The Last Shadow Puppets, Turner and [[Miles Kane]] have released two [[orchestral pop]] albums: ''[[The Age of the Understatement]]'' (2008) and ''[[Everything You've Come to Expect]]'' (2016). Turner also provided [[Submarine (EP)|an acoustic soundtrack]] for the feature film ''[[Submarine (2010 film)|Submarine]]'' (2010), and co-wrote and co-produced [[Alexandra Savior]]'s debut album ''[[Belladonna of Sadness (album)|Belladonna of Sadness]]'' (2017).

Turner's lyricism, ranging from [[kitchen sink realism]] to [[surrealism|surrealist]] wordplay, has been widely praised. Each of his eight studio albums have topped the [[UK Albums Chart]]. He has won seven [[Brit Awards]], an [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Award]], and a [[Mercury Prize]] (having been nominated six times).

===Stage persona===
In an otherwise positive review of a 2006 show, Richard Cromelin of the ''Los Angeles Times'' noted that Turner seemed "a little spooked by the attention" and hoped he would learn "to reach out more to the audience" in time.<ref name="Welcome to the jungle"/><ref>{{cite news |title=The Arctic Monkeys are a thriving species |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-sep-27-wk-monkeys27-story.html |access-date=1 February 2020 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=27 September 2007}}</ref> In 2007, Kitty Empire of ''The Observer'' noted that he was a "reserved" presence on stage: "He chats a bit to about 15 people in the middle of the front rows, and only looks up at the balcony, once, a little apprehensively."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Empire |first1=Kitty |title=Pop: Arctic Monkeys, Astoria, London WC2 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/apr/15/popandrock.features1 |access-date=25 January 2020 |work=The Observer |date=14 April 2007}}</ref> Following Arctic Monkeys' headlining appearance at Glastonbury Festival in 2007, Rosie Swash of ''The Guardian'' remarked upon Turner's "steady, wry stage presence": "Arctic Monkeys don't do ad-libbing, they don't do crowd interaction, and they don't do encores."<ref name="swash"/> Simon Price of ''The Independent'' said Turner seemed "to freeze like a rabbit in the spotlights" during a headlining set at Reading Festival in 2009.<ref>{{cite news |title=Reading Festival, Berkshire |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/reading-festival-berkshire-1782283.html |access-date=8 February 2020 |work=The Independent |date=6 September 2009 }}</ref>

In late 2011, Turner began to change his stage persona and style, most notably changing his hairstyle to a "[[rockabilly]]-inspired [[quiff]]".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Empire |first1=Kitty |title=Arctic Monkeys – review |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/nov/06/arctic-monkeys-review-manchester |access-date=28 January 2020 |work=The Observer |date=6 November 2011}}</ref> Brian Hiatt of ''Rolling Stone'' noted of his "newfound showmanship" that he "puts his guitar down to strut and dance, drops to his knees for solos when he does play, [and] flirts shamelessly with the female fans".<ref name="hiatt"/> In reviewing a 2013 concert, Dorian Lynskey of ''The Guardian'' said, "Turner, a shy sort for a frontman, used to seem unnerved by attention and he's coped by adopting a tongue-in-cheek persona that suggests a comic-strip version of a 50s rock star, a [[Blackpool]] [[Buddy Holly]]: all quiff and quips.
