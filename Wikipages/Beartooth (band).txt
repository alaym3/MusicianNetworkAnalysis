Shomo himself commented on his intentions with Beartooth's style in an interview with ''Alternative Press'' in January 2013, when ''Sick'' had not been released yet, saying: "We just want to make fun, punk-rock, hardcore, wild music, play crazy shows and have a good time without any pressure from anything". When asked about the absence of electronic elements, which he has often worked with, from his new music, he stated: "I don't want any electronics in Beartooth. It is very hardcore and punk roots sounding. I have my electronic thing and I have this more hardcore thing, and I don't want those things to bleed into each other musically."<ref name="shomo's beartooth" /> In an interview with ''[[Kerrang!]]'' Shomo stated that he does not intend to change the band's sound on their second album, and that it will be dark and intense like their debut.<ref name=":0" />
