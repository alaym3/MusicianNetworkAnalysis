'''Jawbreaker''' is an American [[punk rock]] band active from 1986 to 1996, and again since 2017.<ref name="reunion">{{cite web |title=Jawbreaker Reunite After 21 Years for Riot Fest 2017 |date=2017-04-19 |publisher=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork.com]] |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/72987-jawbreaker-reunite-after-21-years-for-riot-fest-2017/ |access-date=2017-04-19}}</ref> The band is considered to be influential to the 1990s [[emo]] genre.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/article/best-emo-songs.html |title=The 100 Greatest Emo Songs of All Time |website=Vulture.com |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |author1=Ian Cohen |author2=David Anthony |author3=Nina Corcoran |author4=Emma Garland |author5=Brad Nelson |date=February 13, 2020 |access-date=February 15, 2020}}</ref> 

Lead vocalist and guitarist [[Blake Schwarzenbach]], bassist Chris Bauermeister, and drummer Adam Pfahler formed the band while students at [[New York University]], later relocating to [[Los Angeles]] where they released their debut album ''[[Unfun]]'' (1990) through [[independent record label]] Shredder Records. Relocating again to [[San Francisco]] the next year, they released 1992's ''[[Bivouac (album)|Bivouac]]'' through the Tupelo Recording Company and The Communion Label.

Schwarzenbach's charisma and personal, frustrated lyrics helped establish him as a [[cult following|cult idol]], even as he underwent surgery to remove painful, voice-threatening [[polyp (medicine)|polyp]]s from his throat. Jawbreaker toured with [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] in 1993 and released ''[[24 Hour Revenge Therapy]]'' in 1994, attracting the attention of major labels. They signed a $1 million contract with [[DGC Records]] and released 1995's ''[[Dear You]]'', but its more polished production and smooth vocals caused significant backlash from the band's core audience.<ref name="Kelley, 81"/><ref name="Greenwald, 25"/> Internal tensions led to Jawbreaker's dissolution in 1996 and Schwarzenbach had repeatedly stated that a reunion would never happen.<ref name="Kelley, 82">Kelley, p. 82.</ref> However, the band announced a reunion in April 2017,<ref name="reunion"/> and they are currently in the process of making the follow-up to ''Dear You''.<ref name="tonedeaf">{{Cite web|title=Legendary punk band Jawbreaker to work on first new music in 23 years|url=https://tonedeaf.thebrag.com/jawbreaker-new-music-23-years/|website=tonedeaf.thebrag.com|date=March 29, 2018|access-date=May 20, 2020}}</ref>

Following the breakup, the members of Jawbreaker were active in other projects including [[Jets to Brazil]] and [[Whysall Lane]]. Pfahler continued to issue previously-recorded Jawbreaker material through his Blackball Records label, and public interest in the band continued due in part to nationally charting [[pop punk]] and emo acts openly indebted to Jawbreaker's sound. In 2004, Pfahler licensed the out-of-print ''Dear You'' from DGC's parent company [[Geffen Records]] and re-released it to positive reviews. [[audio mastering|Remastered]] versions of the rest of the band's catalog have since been released.

== History ==
=== 1986–90: Formation and ''Unfun'' ===
Prior to forming Jawbreaker, [[Blake Schwarzenbach]] and Adam Pfahler were childhood friends in [[Santa Monica, California]] and classmates at [[Crossroads High School]].<ref name="Kelley, 79">{{Cite journal |last=Kelley |first=Trevor |title=The Oral History of Jawbreaker |journal=[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] |page=79 |date=September 2010  |volume=25 |issue=266 |location=[[Cleveland]]}}</ref> In 1986 they moved to [[New York City]] to attend [[New York University]] and decided to start a band.<ref name="Kelley, 79"/> Seeking a [[bassist]], they responded to a [[flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]] posted on campus by Chris Bauermeister.<ref name="Kelley, 79"/> "It wasn't just this Xeroxed thing", Pfahler later recalled, "It was something he had drawn, like a poster. It was all colored and it named all the right bands."<ref name="Kelley, 79"/> The trio began practicing together at Giant Studios on [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]], with Schwarzenbach on [[guitar]] and Pfahler on [[drum kit|drums]].<ref name="Kelley, 79"/> "It was just us, trying to figure each other out in that hourly room for a while", recalls Schwarzenbach, "We went through ''a lot'' of incarnations before we sounded anything like the band we became. I am glad we didn't play live [very much then], because I had to go through my [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] phase."<ref name="Kelley, 79"/> They practiced with several singers and went through several names during this time, eventually settling on the name Rise.<ref name="Kelley, 79"/>

In the fall of 1987 Schwarzenbach, Pfahler, and Bauermeister took time off from college and moved to [[Los Angeles]] to pursue Rise, adding Bauermeister's childhood friend Jon Liu on lead vocals.<ref name="Kelley, 79"/> This changed, however, when Schwarzenbach wrote and sang "Shield Your Eyes" for the band's [[demo (music)|demo]]. It was the first recording on which he sang, and he later noted that it "kind of defined where we would go as a band".<ref name="Kelley, 79"/> According to Liu, "That was the song where everything worked. The vocal arrangements. The lyrics. It was a perfect piece. But to my detriment, I kind of bristled against it. I was like, 'This is amazing, and I don't think I can do ''anything'' like this.{{' "}}<ref name="Kelley, 79"/> The band soon changed their name to Jawbreaker and Schwarzenbach, Pfahler, and Bauermeister decided to continue as a trio with Schwarzenbach on vocals.<ref name="Kelley, 79"/> Bauermeister was given the task of informing Liu that he was no longer in the band, which proved awkward since the two were roommates.<ref name="Kelley, 79"/> "I am cool with it now," reflected Liu in 2010, "It was to everybody's benefit. But at the time, there was some bitterness."<ref name="Kelley, 79"/>

"Shield Your Eyes" was the first Jawbreaker song to be released, on the 7" vinyl [[compilation album]] ''The World's in Shreds Volume Two'' on [[independent record label]] Shredder Records.<ref name="Kelley, 79"/><ref name="Etc.">{{cite AV media notes |title=Etc. |title-link=Etc.

{{quote box |quote=We were beat to shit. We broke up at the end of the tour because, well, why ''wouldn't'' we? We were driving around in Chris' van, with a [[artificial leather|pleather]] couch sliding around in the back, with no air conditioner in the summer. By the end, we were pretty much at each other's throats. So it was like, "Fuck this, let's call it quits. This is insane."<ref name="Kelley, 79"/> |source=–Pfahler on the band's breakup following the "Fuck 90" tour |align=right |salign=right |width=33%}}

In the summer of 1990 Jawbreaker embarked on the "Fuck 90" tour with [[Econochrist]], which proved to be a grueling experience that briefly broke up the band.<ref name="Kelley, 79"/> "It was roughly two months, in the summer, for a totally unknown band", according to Schwarzenbach. "Of that tour, we probably had six rad shows. Then there were maybe 25 utterly forgettable metal-club-in-Florida-type shows."<ref name="Kelley, 79"/> Bauermeister stopped speaking to Pfahler and Schwarzenbach when the tour reached Canada, with several weeks still to go. By the conclusion of the tour, tensions between the members had risen to the point where they announced the band's breakup.<ref name="Kelley, 79"/> Schwarzenbach and Bauermeister returned to New York University to finish their degrees, and rarely spoke to each other.<ref name="Kelley, 80">Kelley, p. 80.</ref>

=== 1991–92: Relocation and ''Bivouac'' ===
Pfahler quickly regretted the breakup, while Schwarzenbach and Bauermeister eventually reconciled in New York.<ref>Kelley, pp. 79–80.</ref> The trio decided to continue with Jawbreaker and relocate to [[San Francisco]], where they had already earned the acceptance of local acts Econochrist and [[Samiam]].<ref name="Kelley, 80"/> In 1991 they moved into an apartment complex in the [[Mission District, San Francisco|Mission District]]; Pfahler and Schwarzenbach shared an apartment across the hall from Bauermeister, [[J Church (band)|J Church]]'s Lance Hahn and roadie Raul Reyes.<ref name="Kelley, 80"/> They recorded their second album, ''[[Bivouac (album)|Bivouac]]'', with [[recording engineer]] [[Billy Anderson (producer)|Billy Anderson]], and it was released in 1992 through the local labels Tupelo Recording Company and The Communion Label.<ref name="Kelley, 80"/> Pfahler has described the album as "varied and ambitious", noting that it "took ages to finish" and "I think we were trying to prove something with that record. We were definitely stretching out."<ref name="Etc."/><ref name="Kelley, 80"/>

By the time of ''Bivouac''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release Schwarzenbach had developed a [[polyp (medicine)|polyp]] on his throat, causing him to lose his voice onstage.<ref name="Kelley, 80"/><ref name="Greenwald, 23"/> As the band drove across the United States to fly from New York City to begin a European tour, he began to suffer serious vocal problems.<ref name="Kelley, 80"/> Though the condition caused him great pain while singing, threatened his voice, and was potentially fatal should the polyp burst or lodge in his throat, the band decided to do the European tour anyway.<ref name="Kelley, 80"/> "That period seemed really arduous for me because I was so physically challenged by singing", recalls Schwarzenbach, "Every day was full of dread, having to stand up there and see what would happen. But it was too late. We had to play or else we would have bankrupted our friends."<ref name="Kelley, 80"/> By the time the band reached [[Ireland]], Schwarzenbach's condition had worsened and the tour was put on hold while he had surgery to remove the polyp.<ref name="Kelley, 80"/> The tour resumed a week later.<ref name="Kelley, 80"/>

=== 1993–94: ''24 Hour Revenge Therapy'' and signing to DGC ===
Upon returning to San Francisco, Pfahler and Schwarzenbach were homeless and slept in the band's touring van for a brief period.<ref name="Kelley, 80"/> They soon found new residences, with Schwarzenbach moving to nearby [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] where he began writing lyrics for the band's third album, ''[[24 Hour Revenge Therapy]]''.<ref name="Kelley, 80"/> Jawbreaker travelled to [[Chicago]] in May 1993 and recorded the bulk of the album with engineer [[Steve Albini]],<ref name="Kelley, 80"/> though the album's production is officially credited on liner notes and packaging to Fluss, Albini's cat. They recorded three additional tracks with [[Billy Anderson (producer)|Billy Anderson]] in San Francisco that August, and the album was released in early 1994 through Tupelo/Communion.<ref name="Kelley, 80"/> Music journalist [[Andy Greenwald]] and ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> Trevor Kelley both cite it as the album most beloved by the band's fans.<ref name="Kelley, 80"/><ref name="Greenwald, 24">Greenwald, p. 24.</ref> "''24 Hour Revenge Therapy'' is arguably Jawbreaker's best album," writes Greenwald, "but it is also far and away its most loved, the best example of Schwarzenbach's innate ability to marry the boozy, bluesy regretfulness of [[The Replacements (band)|the Replacements]] with the loose, seat-of-the-pants attitude of [[924 Gilman Street|Gilman Street]] punk."<ref name="Greenwald, 24"/> As [[dubbing (music)|dubbed]] copies of the album began to circulate in late summer 1993, the band began to earn a devoted fanbase.<ref name="Kelley, 80"/>

[[File:Ben-weasel2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Ben Weasel]] was among the figures in the punk rock community openly critical of Jawbreaker's signing to DGC.]]
In October 1993, prior to ''24 Hour Revenge Therapy''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release, Jawbreaker were asked to open for [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] on six dates of their ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]'' tour.<ref name="Kelley, 81">Kelley, p. 81.</ref> Fans bristled against this, wary that it would result in Jawbreaker—a beloved independent band—signing to major label [[DGC Records]], whom Nirvana were contracted to.<ref name="Kelley, 81"/> "I think we were fortunate [with ''24 Hour Revenge Therapy'']", recalls Schwarzenbach, "But we ''still'' got some flack. Even at that point, there were people who didn't think we were especially punk-rock, as some people practiced it. I don't think there was any major pushback, though, until we did the Nirvana tour. That's ''officially'' when it started."<ref name="Kelley, 81"/> According to Pfahler: "People really came down on us for going on tour with Nirvana. They really saw it as, 'Okay, here we go. This is the first step. The next thing that happens is that someone from the label sees them and they get snapped up.' Which is kind of what happened."<ref name="Kelley, 81"/>

Following the release of ''24 Hour Revenge Therapy'' in February 1994, Jawbreaker received contract offers from major record labels.<ref name="Kelley, 81"/> Though they had already decided to break up following the album's supporting tours due to tiredness and frustration, the band decided to consider the offers, partly due to the major label successes of their peers [[Green Day]] and [[Jawbox]].<ref name="Kelley, 81"/><ref name="Greenwald, 25">Greenwald, p. 25.</ref> They met with a number of labels over the course of the year, narrowing their options to [[Warner Bros. Records]], [[Capitol Records]], and DGC.<ref name="Kelley, 81"/> They signed to DGC in a one million-dollar deal, due in part to the relationship they had developed with [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] representative Mark Kates who they had met on the Nirvana tour.<ref name="Kelley, 81"/> Fans and key figures in the punk rock community were quick to denounce the band for the move.<ref name="Kelley, 81"/> In an interview for [[Ben Weasel]]'s ''Panic Button'' zine following the Nirvana tour, Schwarzenbach had stated flatly that Jawbreaker was not interested in signing to a major record label. In response to the signing, Weasel took the band to task in a column for ''[[Maximumrocknroll]]'' accompanied by a photo depicting him eating his own hat, which he had promised to do if the band ever signed to a major.<ref name="Kelley, 81"/>

=== 1995–96: ''Dear You'' and breakup ===
Jawbreaker began recording their major-label debut, ''[[Dear You]]'', in February 1995 at [[Fantasy Studios]] in [[Berkeley, California]] with [[Rob Cavallo]], who had [[record producer|produced]] Green Day's breakthrough album ''[[Dookie]]'' the previous year.<ref name="Kelley, 81"/> Recording sessions lasted two months and resulted in disenchantment and tension within the band, particularly between Bauermeister and Schwarzenbach.<ref name="Kelley, 81"/> After a week of recording drums and bass guitar, Bauermeister and Pfahler were largely absent from the rest of the sessions while Schwarzenbach continued to work on the album with Cavallo.<ref name="Kelley, 81"/> "I didn't even go", recalled Bauermeister in 2010, "I just hung out at home with my wife. I was already trying to separate myself from the band, while Blake became more of the major force."<ref name="Kelley, 81"/> With a large recording budget at their disposal, Schwarzenbach and Cavallo spent much of their time polishing the record's production value, making the vocals and guitar clear and bringing them to the forefront of the [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mix]].<ref name="Kelley, 81"/> According to Cavallo, "Blake really wanted to be heard. I think he wanted his voice to be heard for the first time. He also decided to sing differently. Then, to me, I thought those songs could benefit from some precision."<ref name="Kelley, 81"/>

[[File:Rob Cavallo.jpg|thumb|upright|Producer [[Rob Cavallo]] gave ''Dear You'' very polished production value in comparison to Jawbreaker's previous albums.]] 
In the months leading up to the album's release, a number of music publications positioned Jawbreaker as the next stars of the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] punk scene, sometimes referring to them as "the thinking man's Green Day".<ref name="Kelley, 81"/> When ''Dear You'' was released in September 1995, however, its polished production and clear vocals strongly divided the band's fanbase.<ref name="Kelley, 81"/><ref name="Greenwald, 25"/> "[''Dear You'']'s production glistened and gleamed," says Greenwald, "Schwarzenbach's voice was sanded and smoothed, and the songs were mellow, introspective affairs. The reaction was harsh—those who had entrusted their emotional lives to Schwarzenbach, had viewed him as a tattered, secular priest to lay their burdens on, felt betrayed."<ref name="Greenwald, 25"/> Ben Weasel was so displeased with the album, particularly the sound of Schwarzenbach's singing, that he wrote Pfahler a letter detailing his complaints with it.<ref name="Kelley, 81"/> Despite a [[music video]] in rotation to support the [[single (music)|single]] "Fireman," sales of ''Dear You'' were poor.<ref name="Greenwald, 25"/>

As the band toured in support of the album, audience reaction toward the new material was either lukewarm or outright negative.<ref name="Kelley, 81"/> "I have never seen anything like that—before or since", said Kates, "There was a point where they were headlining the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy]] and there were kids sitting on the floor, with their backs to the stage, when they were playing songs from ''Dear You''. I'm not making that up. If you were to try to explain that to somebody now, it would make no sense."<ref name="Kelley, 81"/> Jawbreaker continued touring in 1996, opening for the [[Foo Fighters]] that spring, but audience reception did not improve.<ref name="Kelley, 81"/> Samiam's Sergie Loobkoff cites a show at [[The Warfield]] in San Francisco as a turning point: "That is when I knew they were ''definitely'' going to break up. It was their hometown; they had put out the big major-label record. But then you're looking around and it was like no one cared."<ref name="Kelley, 81"/>

Attitudes between the band members continued to sour, particularly between Bauermeister and Schwarzenbach, who took to traveling in separate vans.<ref name="Kelley, 81"/> Tensions came to a head in [[Salem, Oregon]], culminating in a fistfight between the two which spilled out of the van and onto the sidewalk.<ref name="Kelley, 81"/><ref name="Baker">{{cite web |last=Baker |first=Jordan |title=Jawbreaker / Timmy Hansell (In Honor.org) |date=2008-08-30 |website=Pastepunk.com |url=http://www.pastepunk.com/site/jawbreaker-timmy-hansell-in-honororg/ |access-date=2010-09-30}}</ref> "I remember just calling Blake a 'fucking [[prima donna]]' and a 'stupid son of a bitch who thinks it's all about him.' Just letting it all out", says Bauermeister, "It definitely put a wedge between us."<ref name="Kelley, 82"/> On returning to San Francisco, the band called a meeting and decided to break up, though Pfahler was resistant to the idea.<ref name="Kelley, 82"/>

=== 1997–2016: Post-Jawbreaker projects ===
[[File:Blake Schwarzenbach.jpg|thumb|right|Schwarzenbach in 2001 with his post-Jawbreaker act [[Jets to Brazil]].]]
Following the band's breakup, Schwarzenbach moved to [[Brooklyn]] where he [[Disc jockey|DJ]]'d and wrote freelance [[video game]] reviews for websites.<ref name="Kelley, 82"/><ref name="Greenwald, 26">Greenwald, p. 26.</ref> He formed and fronted [[Jets to Brazil]] from 1997 to 2003, combining [[Britpop]] influences, [[piano ballad]]s, and stark lyrics.<ref name="Kelley, 82"/><ref name="Greenwald, 26"/> Fans and critics, however, still associated him primarily with Jawbreaker and did not warm to his new project: "Schwarzenbach was so adored for what he had done that few were willing to allow him to gracefully move on", writes Greenwald, "Jets to Brazil, though popular, has received unspeakably scathing reviews, boiling with the bitterness usually reserved for a cheating lover."<ref name="Greenwald, 26"/>

Bauermeister, meanwhile, returned to his job at the toy store he had worked at before Jawbreaker had begun touring.<ref name="Kelley, 82"/> "I had been on tour, playing in front of thousands of people", he later remarked, "And here I was, working as a toy shop clerk. I was devastated."<ref name="Kelley, 82"/> He eventually returned to music, joining the [[Chicago]] [[pop punk]] band [[Horace Pinker]] from 1999 to 2001, performing on their 2000 EP ''Copper Regret'' before forming the shortlived [[Shorebirds (band)|Shorebirds]] and Mutoid Men with Mattie Jo Canino, formerly of [[Latterman]]. Bauermeister additionally recorded bass on [[RVIVR]]'s 2014 EP ''Bicker & Breathe'', a band also fronted by Canino.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.punknews.org/bands/shorebirds|title=Shorebirds|website=Punknews.org}}</ref><ref name="Kelley, 82"/><ref>{{cite web |last=DaRonco |first=Mike |title=Review: ''Copper Regret'' |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=copper-regret-r492921/review|pure_url=yes}} |access-date=2010-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Heisel |first=Scott |title=Chris Bauermeister's status in Horace Pinker |date=2002-07-24 |website=Punknews.org |url=http://www.punknews.org/article/3928 |access-date=2010-09-30}}</ref>

In August 2007 filmmakers Keith Schieron and Tim Irwin began work on a [[documentary film]] about Jawbreaker, having previously made the 2005 [[Minutemen (band)|Minutemen]] documentary ''[[We Jam Econo]]''.<ref name="Kelley, 82"/><ref name="Kelley, 78">Kelley, p. 78.</ref> All three band members were convinced to take part in the film and met at a San Francisco studio, the first time they had all met together in eleven years.<ref name="Kelley, 82"/> "A couple years ago, I began to have a really nice time with the memory of Jawbreaker," said Schwarzenbach, "I just thought, 'That's good, people finally get it.' It was nice. So I was happy with the idea. I wanted to do it."<ref name="Kelley, 82"/> Bauermeister was unsure about seeing Schwarzenbach again, but stated that "there was a moment when I realized that my resentment was not so much through Blake, but what he had come to represent in my mind.

Coinciding with the band's reunion, the long-in the works documentary ''Don't Break Down: A Film About Jawbreaker'' was premiered on August 11, 2017 in San Francisco, and screened at [[Nitehawk Cinema]] in New York City on August 31. On the night of the documentary's screening, frontman [[Blake Schwarzenbach]] participated in a Q&A session, where he hinted at more shows and added that there was "95% chance of a New York show." He explained, "If we aren't burned alive in Chicago, we wanna do more, and not have to have people make it a destination and pay a ton of money to see us." Schwarzenbach also stated that Jawbreaker was "trying to" write new material.<ref>{{cite web |title=Blake gives Q&A at Jawbreaker screening, says "95% chance of a New York show" |date=2017-09-01 |website=[[BrooklynVegan|Brooklynvegan.com]] |url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/blake-gives-qa-at-jawbreaker-screening-says-95-chance-of-a-new-york-show/ |access-date=2017-09-03}}</ref> Also coinciding with the reunion, Jawbreaker's first demo from 1989 was remastered and remixed, and re-released on their [[Bandcamp]] page.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jawbreaker release remixed/remastered version of first demo (listen) |date=2017-12-04 |website=[[BrooklynVegan|Brooklynvegan.com]] |url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/jawbreaker-release-remixedremastered-version-of-first-demo-listen/ |access-date=2017-12-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Jawbreaker re-release first demo |date=2017-12-05 |website=Punknews.org |url=https://www.punknews.org/article/65350/jawbreaker-re-release-first-demo |access-date=2017-12-17}}</ref>

In a March 2018 interview on the Going Off Track podcast, Schwarzenbach confirmed that, in the summer, Jawbreaker would work on what might result in the band's first album since 1995's ''[[Dear You]]''.

==Lyrics and influence==
{{quote box |quote=[Schwarzenbach's] appeal was his publicly private torment. There was a bitterness and frustration in his lyrics that was both universal and magnetic. Schwarzenbach was the [[poet laureate]] of scruffy white male angst and, by couching his thoughts in his own inscrutable metaphors, he set a pattern for bands that would follow for the next decade.<ref name="Greenwald, 21-22">Greenwald, pp. 21–22.</ref> |source=–[[Andy Greenwald]] |align=right |salign=right |width=33%}}

Many of Schwarzenbach's lyrics were rooted in his specific concerns, often lifted directly from his journal.<ref name="Greenwald, 21">Greenwald, p. 21.</ref> This focus on personal, immediate matters, coupled with descriptive imagery and word choices, attracted listeners to Schwarzenbach and made him a cult idol in rock and roll circles.<ref name="Greenwald, 21-22"/> "The attraction then was to the songwriter," writes Greenwald in ''[[Nothing Feels Good: Punk Rock, Teenagers, and Emo]]'', "it wasn't the song that the listeners related to, it was the singer."<ref name="Greenwald, 20"/> Jawbreaker's tour manager Christy Colcord recalls that "Most of [the fans] hovered around Blake because he was, like, this poet to them. It was all these people who really wanted their heartbreak validated by someone who could understand—or wanted to drink whiskey with them."<ref>Kelley, pp. 80–81.</ref> The idolization of Schwarzenbach came to be described as the Cult of Blake.<ref name="Greenwald, 22">Greenwald, p. 22.</ref> According to rock critic Chris Ryan, "In terms of contemporary music, the Cult of Blake is probably matched only by the Cult of [[Morrissey]]".<ref name="Greenwald, 22"/>

Before ''Bivouac''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release, Jawbreaker recorded the song "Kiss the Bottle" for a Mission District-themed compilation of vinyl singles titled ''17 Reasons: The Mission District''.<ref name="Etc."/> It was the last song they recorded before Schwarzenbach's throat surgery, and his vocals on the recording are mottled and choked.<ref name="Greenwald, 23"/> Greenwald cites the track as "one of [Jawbreaker's] seminal and best-loved songs", calling it "sludgy and churning, a working-class anthem with a steady, proletarian heart".<ref>Greenwald, pp. 22–23.</ref> With lyrics profiling a pair of drunks outside a Mission District liquor store, {{" '}}Kiss the Bottle,' more than any other song, captures the sensitive boy machismo that drew (and continues to draw) male listeners to the altar of Schwarzenbach. With its fictional scrim, 'Kiss the Bottle' functions like a country song: the emotional impact is heightened by the specificity, not lessened.
