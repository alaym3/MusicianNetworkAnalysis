Since their formation, they have released multiple studio albums and one live album, ''[[Live from Portland]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/musica?aid=kyvgwawzgaP&sa=X&oi=music&ct=result |title=Search Features |publisher=Google.com |access-date=October 15, 2011}}</ref> They have sold over 3 million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-20296-jesus_freaks.html|title=Kutless: Portland's 3-million Selling Christian Rockers|work=wweek.com|access-date=May 26, 2015}}</ref>

== History ==
=== Earlier years (1999–2000) ===
The band was formed in Portland, Oregon, as a campus worship band named "Call Box". They performed during the 1999–2000 school year at [[Warner Pacific College]]. Their first guitarist, Andrew Morrison, decided to leave the band shortly before they signed with BEC records. James Mead replaced Andrew at lead guitar.<ref>personal account from Andrew Morrison</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kutless.com/kutlessHistory.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809032856/http://www.kutless.com/kutlessHistory.aspx|title=Kutless History  . . . / Kutless \ . . .|archive-date=August 9, 2010|work=kutless.com|access-date=May 26, 2015}}</ref> The Band changed their name to "Kutless" in October 2001,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kutless.com/kutlessTimeline.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113053420/http://www.kutless.com/kutlessTimeline.aspx|title=Kutless Timeline  . . . / Kutless \ . . .|archive-date=November 13, 2009|work=kutless.com|access-date=May 26, 2015}}</ref> before releasing their first three-track EP followed up by their full-length album in 2002 on [[BEC Recordings]]. Kutless chose their name because of a [[Bible]] verse. [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 6:23 says, "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord" (NRSV). Because of this, the band says, "He took our cuts for us... leaving us 'Kutless'."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kutless.com/faq.aspx|title=General Info about Kutless.../ Kutless \...|work=kutless.com|access-date=May 26, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715013608/http://www.kutless.com/Faq.aspx|archive-date=July 15, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

=== Early releases (2002–2007) ===
Kutless' first two singles from their self-titled debut album were "Your Touch" and "Run". The latter would hold the record for the longest-charting song in the history of the ''[[R&R (magazine)|R&R]]'' Top 40 charts.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Kutless had their touring debut between February and April 2003 when they opened up for [[Audio Adrenaline]] and [[MercyMe]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In 2004, Kutless released their second full-length album ''[[Sea of Faces]]''. The album peaked at No.&nbsp;97 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} After selling over 250,000 copies, Kutless went on their first headlining tour, X 2004. That year, Kutless was scheduled to perform at the 2004 Summer [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] in Greece, but could not make it because the airline canceled their flight.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In 2005, Kutless played a Katrina Benefit Relief Concert in Portland, Oregon. They also released their first worship album, ''[[Strong Tower]]'' that peaked at No.&nbsp;87 on the ''Billboard'' 200 albums chart. After recording but before release of ''Strong Tower'', [[bassist]] Kyle Zeigler and [[drummer]] Kyle Mitchell left the band to form Verbatim Records, a nationally distributed record label based in the Portland, Oregon area. They were replaced with bassist Dave Luetkenhoelter and drummer Jeffrey Gilbert, who both came from the recently broken-up Christian rock band [[Seven Places]]. Kutless also went on the Strong Tower tour that year.

The fourth album, ''[[Hearts of the Innocent]]'', was released on March 21, 2006, peaking at No.&nbsp;45 on the ''Billboard'' 200 Albums chart.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} The band followed up with a tour, also featuring [[Stellar Kart]], [[Disciple (band)|Disciple]], and [[Falling Up (band)|Falling Up]].

On the March 28, 2006, an episode of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', "[[My Bright Idea]]", incorporated a significant portion of the song "All the Words" from ''[[Sea of Faces]]'' during the final scene. The episode hit an eleven-week ratings high, and was among the first ''Scrubs'' episodes that could be downloaded on iTunes. Laura Hutfless from the William Morris Agency said, "Placing the Kutless song, 'All the Words', on Scrubs was truly a team effort. We at William Morris were all very pleased with the way the song was incorporated into the television show and are thrilled that millions of Americans have now been exposed to this incredible band. I'm confident that this is only the beginning for Kutless as they continue to give their audience captivating and inspirational music and win new fans everyday." Kutless's video "Shut Me Out" has been placed on an exclusive Microsoft/Wal-Mart DVD give-a-way. Consumers who purchase the new [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] game "The Apprentice," featuring Donald Trump, will receive a copy of Kutless's new video. This is estimated to be in the hands of 350,000 gamers. Plus, Target Stores announced that the "Shut Me Out" video will play nationwide in all stores on Target TV (Red Channel) beginning in May (from Big Machine Media). [[Suzuki Motor Corporation]] announced that it will be the sole sponsor of the band's Hearts of the Innocent tour.
