'''Elizabeth''' was an [[Music of the United States|American]] [[psychedelic rock]]/[[progressive rock]] [[musical group|band]] that were active from 1967 to 1970. They were based out of Philadelphia and known for their unique musical and sonic blend of [[baroque music|baroque]], [[classical music|classical]], [[Folk music|folk]], [[American rock]], [[British rock]], [[country music|country]], and [[ragtime]].  Elizabeth's members were: Steve Weingarten (lead guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), who died in 2007; Bob Patterson (rhythm guitar, lead and backing vocals); Jim Dahme (flute, lead and backing vocals); Steve Paul Bruno (bass, organ, backing vocals); and, Hank Ransome (drums).

==History==
In 1968, the band recorded and released their self-titled album on [[Vanguard Records]] (produced by [[Sam Charters]]).<ref>[http://www.redtelephone66.com/2010/09/elizabeth-elizabeth-1968/ "Elizabeth"] Retrieved on 9 July 2012</ref> Vanguard's artist roster at the time included [[Joan Baez]], [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]] and [[Country Joe and the Fish]]. Elizabeth performed with [[Cream (band)|Cream]],<ref name="blogspot1">[http://rockprosopography101.blogspot.com/2010/06/2201-arch-street-philadelphia-pa.html "Elizabeth"] Retrieved on June 2, 2010</ref> [[Blue Cheer]],<ref name="blogspot1"/> [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Ritchie Havens]], [[The Chambers Brothers]] and many other musical luminaries of that era. Some of the bands' many Philadelphia area performances included concerts and sets at: [[The Main Point]], The Second Fret, The [[Electric Factory]], and most Be-INs at Belmont Plateau in Philadelphia's Fairmount Park.

As the band was starting to come together (nameless at that point), Steve and Robert "[[Stewkey]]" Antoni, bandmates from Newport, RI, made an unexpected stop in Philadelphia on their way to Florida. After a week in the [[City of brotherly love]], they decided to forgo Florida and help form Elizabeth.<ref>[http://www.bignoisenow.com/nazz.html "Elizabeth"] Retrieved on March 21, 2014</ref> Some interesting guitarists auditioned for the band, including future rock star [[Todd Rundgren]] who was with Woody's Truck Stop at the time; and, [[Nick Jameson]], soon to be a founder and guitarist of [[Nick Jameson|The American Dream]] (both were Philly bands). Within a month or so of landing in Philadelphia, Stewkey left Elizabeth to join Todd's new band, [[The Nazz]]. Of note, [[Mandrake Memorial|Linda Cohen]], a Philadelphia classical guitarist, was Elizabeth's first drummer (briefly). During the spring and summer of 1969, she teamed up with Michael Kac from [[Mandrake Memorial]] and, together, performed as a classical-pop fusion guitar-harpsichord duo. Linda died in 2009<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/lindacohen |title=LINDA COHEN, 1947 - 2009 &#124; Listen and Stream Free Music, Albums, New Releases, Photos, Videos |publisher=Myspace.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-22}}</ref> of lung cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/2009-01-28/news/25279050_1_classical-guitarist-teaching-guitar-new-music |title=Linda Cohen, 61, guitarist, composer, committed teacher - Philly.com |publisher=Articles.philly.com |date=2009-01-28 |accessdate=2014-07-22}}</ref> Mandrake Memorial and Elizabeth shared the stage many times.

==Post-Elizabethan life==
After Elizabeth disbanded in 1970, the band's members pursued various musical and non-musical endeavors. Hank went on to play with the group Good God.<ref>[http://badcatrecords.com/BadCat/GOODgod.htm "Good God"] Retrieved on 9 July 2012</ref> Steve began a recording/engineering career that kicked off at Vanguard and [[Electric Lady Studios]]. Bob moved to Florida and is quite active to this day as a Singer, Songwriter, Storyteller and Visual Artist. Linda Cohen recorded 3 albums (1971-1973) that were produced by [[Mandrake Memorial|Craig Anderton]] from Mandrake Memorial. Stewkey recorded 3 albums with The Nazz (1968-1971).

The Elizabeth album was re-mastered from the original tapes and re-released on CD in 2000 by the Akarma Vanguard label. The release comes housed in a mini album-styled sleeve that perfectly reproduces the original records foldout cover graphics. The popular Elizabeth track, "You Should Be More Careful", appears on the 2010 Vanguard album release (2-disk vinyl set) entitled [http://www.vanguardrecords.com/index.php?controller=albums&task=view&id=452&option=com_vgrecords "Follow Me Down: Vanguard's Lost Psychedelic Era (1966-1970)"]<ref>[http://www.vanguardrecords.com/index.php?controller=albums&task=view&id=452&option=com_vgrecords "Side B, Track 1.
