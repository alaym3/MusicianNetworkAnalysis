'''Darrell Wayne Evans''' (born May 26, 1947) is a former American [[baseball]] player, coach and manager. He played 21 seasons in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB), beginning his career as a [[third baseman]] with the [[Atlanta Braves]] (1969–1976, 1989), alternating between [[first baseman|first]] and third base with the [[San Francisco Giants]] (1976–1983), and playing much of his later career as a first baseman and then a [[designated hitter]] for the [[Detroit Tigers]] (1984–1988). He won a [[1984 World Series|World Series]] championship with the Tigers in [[1984 Detroit Tigers season|1984]]. Evans had most of his success in the early and late stages of his career. He was a two-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]], first with the Braves in 1973 and then with the Giants in 1983. He led MLB in [[home run]]s in 1985 with the Tigers, and [[Base on balls|walks]] in 1973 and 1974 with the Braves.

Born in [[Pasadena, California]], Evans was the son of a professional fast pitch softball player. He attended [[Pasadena City College]] and helped lead the baseball and [[basketball]] teams to California junior college championships. In the majors, Evans had a breakout season in 1973, finishing third in MLB with 41 [[home run]]s and leading the league in [[runs created]] and walks. He was traded to the [[San Francisco Giants]] in the middle of his lackluster 1976 season. His best season with the Giants was his 1983 All-Star season when he hit 30 home runs and compiled a .378 [[on-base percentage]] in his last year with the team. Evans signed as a free agent with the [[Detroit Tigers]] prior to the 1984 season, winning the [[1984 World Series|World Series]] in his first year with the team. He led MLB in home runs in 1985 at age 38, becoming the oldest player to lead the [[American League]] in home runs and the first in MLB history to have a 40-homer season in both the American and the [[National League]]s. Evans concluded his playing career with a return to the Braves in 1989.

Baseball historian [[Bill James]] rated Evans as "the most underrated player in baseball history."<ref name=BJ/> He was the 22nd player in MLB history to hit 400 home runs and the second to hit at least 100 home runs with three different teams. His 1,605 walks ranked eighth in MLB history at the time of his retirement, and he drew 90 or more walks in eight separate seasons (reaching 100+ walks five times). His skill in drawing walks contributed to a .361 career [[on-base percentage]] despite a .248 career [[Batting average (baseball)|batting average]]. After retiring as a player, Evans served as a [[Manager (baseball)|manager]] and coach in [[Minor League Baseball]] and [[Independent baseball league|independent leagues]] from 1990 to 2010. His career as a manager included stints with the [[Wilmington Blue Rocks]] and the [[Huntsville Stars]] in the minors.

==Professional baseball player==
===Minor leagues===
Evans was drafted by the [[Chicago Cubs]] in 1965, the [[New York Yankees]] and [[Detroit Tigers]] in 1966, and the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] and [[Kansas City Athletics]] in 1967.<ref name=BR/> He originally didn't sign with the Cubs out of high school because he was planning to play baseball on full scholarship at the [[USC Trojans baseball|University of Southern California]], but that did not materialize. In June 1967, he finally signed a pro contract with the Athletics, receiving a $15,000 signing bonus.<ref name=Party/><ref>{{cite news|title=Evans Signs Contract For $20,000|newspaper=Pasadena Independent|date=June 23, 1967|page=A4|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33272405/evans_signs_contract_for_20000/}}</ref>

Evans played for three different minor league clubs during the 1967 season: Leesburg in the [[Florida State League]], Peninsula in the [[Carolina League]], and Bradenton of the [[Gulf Coast League]].

===Atlanta Braves===
====1969 to 1972 seasons====
In December 1968, after the A's chose not to include Evans on their list of protected minor league players, Evans was selected by the [[Atlanta Braves]] in the [[Rule 5 draft]] for $25,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Braves Draft Two Players|newspaper=The Atlanta Constitution|date=December 3, 1968|page=38|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33273325/braves_draft_two_players/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Evans, Braves Bounce Nats, 9-4: Rookie Bids For Position|newspaper=The Atlanta Constitution|date=March 29, 1969|page=15|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33274161/evans_braves_bounce_nats_94_rookie/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> Evans began the 1969 season with the Braves but was limited to pinch-hitting.

Evans began the 1971 season with Richmond where he was moved to the outfield and batted .307 with a .437 on-base percentage.<ref name=BRM/>  In late May, Evans received an opportunity to become the Braves' starting third baseman when the team released [[Clete Boyer]] following Boyer's open criticism of the team's general manager.<ref>{{cite news|title=Boyer Departs Quietly After High Noon Talk|newspaper=The Atlanta Constitution|date=May 29, 1971|page=1C|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33276975/boyer_departs_quietly_after_high_noon/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref>  Evans appeared in 72 games at the third base for the 1971 Braves; he hit .242 in 260 at bats in his rookie season.<ref name=BR/> Atlanta hitting coach (and later manager) [[Eddie Mathews]] worked with Evans on his fielding.<ref name=Improv/> Evans later recalled: "Eddie was not only my manager, he was my friend.

In 1972, Evans was the Braves' regular third baseman, appearing in 125 games. He demonstrated his control of the strike zone, drawing 90 walks (fifth in the National League) and compiling a .384 on-base percentage (seventh in the league). Although his 25 errors ranked second among National League third basemen, he improved defensively, leading the league's third basemen with a range factor of 3.24 per game and ranking high among the league's third basemen with 126 putouts (second), 273 assists (fourth), and 20 double plays (fourth).<ref name=BR/>

====1973 breakout season====
Evans had a breakout season in [[1973 Atlanta Braves season|1973]].  He was selected as the reserve third baseman (behind starter [[Ron Santo]]) on the 1973 National League All-Star team, ultimately finishing the year with 41 home runs (third in MLB behind [[Willie Stargell]] and teammate [[Davey Johnson]]) and an on-base plus slugging percentage (OPS) of .959 (third in MLB behind teammate [[Hank Aaron]] and Stargell). Evans also led the major leagues in walks with 125 and runs created with 143. With his high walk rate, he reached based 294 times, second only to [[Pete Rose]], and had a .403 on-base percentage. Additionally, he was third in extra-base hits with 74, and also finished fourth in runs scored with 114 and fifth in RBIs with 105. This was the only season of Evans's career where he had over 100 runs or 100 RBIs.<ref>{{cite web|title=1973 MLB Batting Leaders|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|work=Baseball-Reference.com|access-date=June 26, 2019|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/1973-batting-leaders.shtml}}</ref> He also ranked among the best defensive third basemen in the National League with a 3.08 range factor per game (first in NL), 124 putouts (second in NL), and 325 assists (second in NL).<ref name=BR/> Evans told reporters in July 1973 that his defensive improvement "has meant more to me than the home runs."<ref>{{cite news|title=Homer-Hitting Darrell Evans Proud of Improved Defense|newspaper=[[Palladium-Item]]|date=July 21, 1973|page=12|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33279870/homerhitting_darrell_evans_proud_of/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref>

Evans' 1973 accomplishments were overshadowed by teammate [[Hank Aaron]]'s pursuit of [[Babe Ruth]]'s career home run record. Evans responded to the lack of attention to his accomplishments, telling reporters in August 1973: "I can't say it bothers me. Hell, I enjoy reading about Hank, just like everyone else."<ref>{{cite news|title=The Man In Aaron's Shadow|newspaper=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|author=Bob Hertzel|date=August 3, 1973|page=31|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33279661/the_man_in_aarons_shadow/}}</ref> Evans hit before Aaron in the Braves' batting order, and in April the following season, he was on first base when Aaron hit his historic 715th home run.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Muder |first1=Craig |title=Henry Aaron Hits Homer No. 715 |url=https://baseballhall.org/discover-more/stories/inside-pitch/henry-aaron-hits-home-run-number-715 |website=Baseball Hall of Fame |access-date=7 March 2020}}</ref> The 1973 Braves were the first team in major league history to have three players – Evans, Aaron, and [[Davey Johnson]] – hit at least 40 home runs.<ref>{{cite news|title=The year they went for 40|newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|date=July 12, 2005|page=C5|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33302498/the_year_they_went_for_40/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> Despite the surge in power, the 1973 Braves finished fifth in the National League West with a 76–85 record due to a pitching staff that allowed the most runs in the National League.<ref>{{cite web |title=1973 NL Team Statistics |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1973.shtml |website=Baseball-Reference.com |publisher=Sports Reference LLC |access-date=7 March 2020}}</ref>

====1974 to 1976 seasons====
Prior to the 1974 season, Evans pursued salary arbitration,<ref>{{cite news|title=Evans seeks $30,000 raise|newspaper=[[Billings Gazette]]|date=February 15, 1974|page=19|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33280661/evans_seeks_30000_raise/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> where he was awarded a $52,500 salary.<ref name=BR/>  Evans appeared in 160 games at third base for the [[1974 Atlanta Braves season|Braves]].

Evans attributed his less impressive performance in part to "personal problems, some private things that were bothering me."<ref name=ETOW/>

The 1975 season was Evans' final full season with the Braves.  Following the trade of Hank Aaron, Evans took over Aaron's third spot in the batting over.<ref name=KPDE>{{cite news|title=King Praises Darrell Evans|newspaper=[[The News Herald (Panama City)|The News-Herald]] (Panama City, FL)|date=April 26, 1975|page=5B|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33281795/king_praises_darrell_evans/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref>  After a strong start in April,<ref name=KPDE/> Evans' output slowed.

His power output also declined, as he totaled just 22 home runs and 73 RBIs to go along with a .406 slugging percentage.<ref name=BR/> Evans' output declined further at the start of the 1976 season. With [[Jerry Royster]] taking over at third base, Evans was moved to first base.

===San Francisco Giants===
[[File:Darrell Evans 1983.jpg|thumb|right|145px|Evans with the Giants in 1983]]
On June 13, 1976, the Braves traded Evans with [[Marty Perez]] to the [[San Francisco Giants]] in exchange for [[Willie Montañez]], [[Craig Robinson (baseball)|Craig Robinson]], and two other players.<ref>{{cite news|title=Braves Trade Evans, Perez To Giants|newspaper=The Atlanta Constitution|date=June 14, 1976|page=1D|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33282450/braves_trade_evans_perez_to_giants/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> He promptly became the Giants' starting first baseman. In his first season in San Francisco, Evans compiled a .222 batting average with 10 home runs in 92 games.<ref name=BR/> In his early years with the Giants, Evans shifted between left field, third base, and first base. In 1978, he settled in at third base, starting 612 games at that position from 1978 to 1982. 

In 1983, Evans shifted back to first base and had his best season in San Francisco. He was named to the National League All-Star team as a reserve first baseman, hit 30 home runs and compiled a .378 on-base percentage and .516 slugging percentage.<ref name=BR/> He won the team's 1983 [[Willie Mac Award]] for his spirit and leadership. Evans spent eight seasons with the Giants, appearing in 1,094 games, compiling a .255 batting average, .358 on-base percentage, and .422 slugging percentage with 142 home runs, 525 RBIs and 605 walks.<ref name=BR/>

Playing for the World Series champion [[1984 Detroit Tigers season|1984 Detroit Tigers]], Evans hit a three-run home run in his first regular season game in a Detroit uniform on the road against Minnesota. One week later, he hit another three-run home run with his first swing at Tiger Stadium.<ref>{{cite news|title=Roaring 20|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=June 22, 2004|page=1D|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33302744/roaring_20/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> For the season, he appeared in 131 games, 62 as the designated hitter, 47 at first base, and 19 at third base. His .238 batting average was the lowest since 1976, but 77 walks (seventh in the American League) boosted his on-base percentage to .353. He also totaled 16 home runs and 63 RBIs for the 1984 Tigers. In the [[1984 World Series]], Evans managed only one hit in 15 at bats for a .067 batting average.<ref name=BR/>

====1985 season and home run title====
In 1985, Evans had one of the best offensive seasons of his career. He appeared in 151 games, 113 at first base, 33 as the designated hitter, and seven at third base.<ref name=BR/> At age 38, he led the major leagues with 40 home runs, while driving in 94 runs.<ref>{{cite news|title=Evans is finally hearing those three little words|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|author=[[Mitch Albom]]|date=October 4, 1985|page=1D|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33288183/evans_is_finally_hearing_those_three/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> He became the oldest player to register 40 home runs in American League history, a feat not topped until [[Nelson Cruz]] hit 41 homers for the [[Minnesota Twins]] in 2019 at age 38/39. Evans was also the oldest player to lead the American League in home runs, and the first player to hit 40 home runs in both the National and American Leagues.<ref name=TOY/> He also registered a .356 on-base percentage (as a result of drawing 85 walks), and his .519 slugging percentage was his best since his breakout season in 1973.<ref name=BR/> He was selected by both Detroit sports writers and fans for the 1985 Tiger of the Year award.<ref name=TOY>{{cite news|title=He's the Tiger of the Year: Darrell Evans a big hit in the polls|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=November 2, 1985|page=1D|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33288368/hes_the_tiger_of_the_year_darrell/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref>

====1986 to 1988 seasons====
At the start of the [[1986 Detroit Tigers season|1986 season]], Detroit manager [[Sparky Anderson]] announced that Evans would not be the Tigers' first baseman and would instead be the team's designated hitter.  Evans publicly expressed his frustration at losing his spot in the lineup after hitting 40 home runs.<ref>{{cite news|title=Evans, a sensitive leader, is suddenly focus of conflict|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=April 6, 1986|page=7F|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33288510/evans_a_sensitive_leader_is_suddenly/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> In the end, Anderson relented, and Evans played 105 games at first base and 42 as the designated hitter for the 1986 Tigers. He hit 29 home runs (part of a Tigers [[Infield (baseball)|infield]] in which all four players hit at least 20 homers) and had 85 RBIs while compiling a .356 on-base percentage.<ref name=BR/>

Evans' three-year contract expired after the 1986 season, and the Tigers decided not to offer him a contract to avoid triggering Evans' arbitration rights.<ref>{{cite news|title=Evans given Tigers' last offer, Lajoie says|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=February 6, 1987|page=1D|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33288687/evans_given_tigers_last_offer/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref>  No other teams made offers to Evans, and in late February 1987, he signed a one-year contract with the Tigers; the contract cut his salary by $200,000 to between $500,000 and $550,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=A cut above: Evans, Herndon endure pay slashes|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=February 27, 1987|page=1D|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33288760/a_cut_above_evans_herndon_endure_pay/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> During the 1987 season, Evans appeared in 150 games for the Tigers, including 105 at first base and 44 as the designated hitter. He drew 100 walks in 1987, fourth most in the American League, pumping his on-base percentage to .379, his highest since 1974. He also hit 34 home runs, had 99 RBIs (second most in his career), and finished 12th in the voting for the American League Most Valuable Player Award.<ref name=BR/> In the [[1987 American League Championship Series]], he compiled a .294 batting average and .455 on-base percentage.<ref name=BR/> However, he was also picked off at third base in the fourth game of the ALCS, "hammering the final nail" into the Tigers' defeat.<ref>{{cite news|title=We'll miss Evans, for all the right reasons|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=October 29, 1988|page=1D|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33289013/well_miss_evans/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> 

Evans returned to Detroit for one last season in 1988. He appeared in 144 games (72 at DH, 65 at 1B) and had 22 home runs, including his 400th career homer in September, but he saw his batting average drop precipitously to .208.<ref name=BR/> At the end of the 1988 season, the Tigers announced that Evans, age 41, would not be offered a contract for the 1989 season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Terrell dealt; Evans won't get contract|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=October 29, 1988|page=1D|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/33289040/terrell_dealt_evans_wont_get_contract/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> Evans appeared in 727 games in five years with the Tigers, hit 141 home runs, and compiled a .358 on-base percentage and .450 slugging percentage.<ref name=BR/>

He appeared in his final major league game on October 1, 1989, at age 42.<ref name=BR/> At the beginning of April 1990, the Braves released Evans, ending his playing career. At the time, Evans told the [[Associated Press]]: "It's happened to a lot of my friends and it's not easy. I guess when it slaps you in the face you don't know how to feel. I don't know what to expect because I've never been in this situation before."<ref>{{cite news|title=Braves Release 21-Year Veteran Darrell Evans|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 5, 1990|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-04-05-sp-1206-story.html}}</ref> Evans appeared in 866 games in nine years with the Braves, hitting 131 home runs and compiling a .368 on-base percentage.<ref name=BR/>

Evans hit 60 home runs after reaching age 40, at the time a major league record.

Evans averaged 97 walks per 162 games, and drew 100 or more walks five times (1973–1975, 1978, and 1987).<ref name=BR/>   His career total of 1,605 walks ranked eighth in major league history at the time of his retirement and remains 12th most in major league history.<ref>{{cite web|title=Career Leaders & Records for Bases on Balls|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|work=Baseball-Reference.com|access-date=June 26, 2019|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/BB_career.shtml}}</ref>
