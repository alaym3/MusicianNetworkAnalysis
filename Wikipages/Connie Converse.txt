'''Elizabeth Eaton Converse''' (born August 3, 1924, disappeared August 1974), known professionally as '''Connie Converse''', was an American singer-songwriter and musician, active in New York City in the 1950s. Her work is among the earliest known recordings of the [[singer-songwriter]] genre of music.<ref name=IY>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29258982|title=Connie Converse: The mystery of the original singer-songwriter|date=October 1, 2014|access-date=October 16, 2021|first=Ian|last=Youngs|publisher=BBC News|archive-date=October 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191028101650/https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-29258982|url-status=live}}</ref>

Converse left her family home in 1974 in search of a new life and was not heard from again.<ref name=IY/> Her music was largely unknown until it was featured on a 2004 radio show and a compilation album of her work, ''How Sad, How Lovely'', was released in March 2009.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Converse was born in [[Laconia, New Hampshire]] on August 3, 1924.<ref name=":1">{{Cite magazine|last=Nast|first=Condé|date=November 21, 2016|title=Connie Converse's Time Has Come|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/connie-converses-time-has-come|access-date=July 14, 2021|magazine=The New Yorker|language=en-US}}</ref> She was raised in [[Concord, New Hampshire]] as the middle child in a strict [[Baptists|Baptist]] family; her father was a minister and her mother was "musical", according to music historian [[David Garland (musician)|David Garland]]. Her brother [[Philip Converse]] became a prominent [[Political science|political scientist]].<ref name=":1" />

Converse attended [[Concord High School (New Hampshire)|Concord High School]], where she was [[valedictorian]] and won eight academic awards,<ref name="DV">{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/The-musical-mystery-of-Connie-Converse-3248530.php|title=The musical mystery of Connie Converse|work=SFGate|date=March 8, 2009|agency=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=August 9, 2015|author=Vigil, Delfin|archive-date=September 24, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924160103/http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/The-musical-mystery-of-Connie-Converse-3248530.php|url-status=live}}</ref> including an academic scholarship to [[Mount Holyoke College]] in [[Massachusetts]]. After two years' study, she left Mount Holyoke and moved to New York City.<ref name="TA">{{cite news|url=http://www.theawl.com/2010/08/the-story-of-connie-converse|title=The Story of Connie Converse|date=August 3, 2010|access-date=June 1, 2013|last=Jefferson|first=Cord|newspaper=The Awl|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616234900/http://www.theawl.com/2010/08/the-story-of-connie-converse|archive-date=June 16, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Career===

During the 1950s, Converse worked for the Academy Photo Offset printing house in New York's [[Flatiron District]]. She first lived in [[Greenwich Village]], then in the [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] and [[Harlem]] areas.<ref name=":0"/> She started calling herself Connie, a nickname she had acquired in New York. She began writing songs and performing them for friends, accompanying herself on guitar.<ref name=TA/> She began smoking during this time and started drinking; traits strongly contrary to her religious upbringing.<ref name=TA/> Possibly as a result, her parents rejected her music career, and her father never heard her sing before his death.<ref name=TA/>

Converse's only known public performance was a brief television appearance in 1954 on ''The Morning Show'' on [[CBS]] with [[Walter Cronkite]], which graphic artist [[Gene Deitch]] had helped to arrange.<ref name=TA/> By 1961 (the same year that [[Bob Dylan]] moved to Greenwich Village and quickly met mainstream success), Converse had grown frustrated trying to sell her music in New York. That year, she moved to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], where her brother [[Philip Converse|Philip]] was a professor of political science at the [[University of Michigan]]. Converse worked in a secretarial job, and then as a writer for and Managing Editor of the ''[[Journal of Conflict Resolution]]'' in 1963.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Converse|first=Elizabeth|date=January 1, 1968|title=The War of All against All: A Review of The Journal of Conflict Resolution, 1957–1968|jstor=173462|journal=The Journal of Conflict Resolution|volume=12|issue=4|pages=471–532|doi=10.1177/002200276801200404|s2cid=145911704}}</ref><ref name=TA/> Following her move to Michigan, she mostly ceased writing new songs.

==Personal life==

Converse was very private about her personal life. According to Deitch, she would respond to questions about her personal life with curt "yes" or "no" answers. Both Deitch and Connie's brother Philip have said it is possible she might have been a lesbian, although she never confirmed or denied this notion.<ref name=WL>'' We Lived Alone: The Connie Converse Documentary'', directed by Andrea Kannes.</ref><ref name=TA/> Her nephew, Tim Converse, has said there is no evidence that she was ever involved in a romantic relationship.<ref name=WL/> Her family noted that Connie relied more heavily on smoking and drinking towards the end of her time living in Michigan.<ref name=WL/><ref name=TA/>

==Disappearance==

By 1973, Converse was [[occupational burnout|burnt out]] and depressed. The offices of ''[[The Journal of Conflict Resolution]]'', which meant so much to her, left Michigan for [[Yale]] at the end of 1972, after being "auctioned off" without her knowledge. Converse's colleagues and friends pooled their money to give her a six-month trip to England in hopes of improving her mood, to no avail.<ref name=TA/> Her mother requested that she join her on a trip to [[Alaska]], and Converse begrudgingly agreed. Her displeasure with the trip appeared to have contributed to her decision to disappear. Around that time, Converse was told by doctors that she needed a [[hysterectomy]], and the information appeared to have devastated her.<ref name=TA/>

In August 1974, days after her 50th birthday,<ref name=IY/> Converse wrote a series of letters to her family and friends, discussing her intention to make a new life somewhere else. She wrote, "Let me go. Let me be if I can. Let me not be if I can't. [...] Human society fascinates me & awes me & fills me with grief & joy; I just can't find my place to plug into it." With her letter to Philip, Converse included a check and a request that he make sure that her [[health insurance]] was paid for and in good standing for a certain amount of time following her departure, but for him to cease paying the policy on a certain date.<ref name=WL/>

Converse was expected to go on an annual family trip to a lake, but by the time the letters were delivered, she had packed her belongings in her [[Volkswagen Beetle]] and driven away, never to be heard from again.<ref name=TA/> The events of her life following her disappearance remain unknown. Several years after she left, someone told her brother Philip that they had seen a [[Telephone directory|phone book]] listing for "Elizabeth Converse" in either [[Kansas]] or [[Oklahoma]], but he never pursued the lead.<ref name=TA/> About ten years after she disappeared, the family hired a [[private investigator]] in hopes of finding her. The investigator told the family, however, that even if he did find her, it was her right to disappear, and he could not simply bring her back.<ref name=":0"/> After that, her family respected her decision to leave, and ceased looking for her. Philip suspects she may have [[suicide|taken her own life]]—he specifically thinks she may have driven her car into a body of water—but her actual fate remains unknown.<ref name=":0"/>

==Legacy==

In January 2004, Deitch—by then 80 years old and having lived in [[Prague]] since 1959—was invited by New York music historian [[David Garland (musician)|David Garland]] to appear on his [[WNYC]] radio show ''Spinning on Air''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/62100-background-the-deitch-connection/|title=Background: the Deitch Connection|publisher=WNYC|work=Spinning on Air|date=March 15, 2009|access-date=August 8, 2015|author=Garland, David|archive-date=March 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081706/http://www.wnyc.org/story/62100-background-the-deitch-connection/|url-status=live}}</ref> Deitch played some of the recordings of Converse he had made on a [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape recorder]], including her song, "One by One".<ref name=IY/> Two of Garland's listeners, Dan Dzula and David Herman, were inspired to track down any additional recordings of Converse.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://www.theawl.com/2011/12/the-connie-converse-double-album-that-never-got-crowd-funded|title=The Connie Converse Double Album That Never Got Crowd-Funded|publisher=The Awl|date=December 2, 2011|access-date=August 8, 2015|author=Anderson, L.V.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909100543/http://www.theawl.com/2011/12/the-connie-converse-double-album-that-never-got-crowd-funded|archive-date=September 9, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> They found two sources for Converse's music: Deitch's collection in Prague, and a filing cabinet in Ann Arbor containing recordings which Converse had sent to Philip in the late 1950s.<ref name=RF>{{cite news|url=https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2009/june/1274511577/robert-forster/lost-women-found|title=Lost Women Found|work=The Monthly: Australian Politics, Society & Culture|date=June 2009|agency=The Monthly|access-date=August 8, 2015|author=Forster, Robert|location=Australia|archive-date=September 12, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912125949/https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2009/june/1274511577/robert-forster/lost-women-found|url-status=live}}</ref> In March 2009, ''How Sad, How Lovely'', containing 17 songs by Converse, was released by Lau derette Recordings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/tony-sachs/50-years-late-connie-conv_b_173386.html|title=50 Years Late, Connie Converse Is Music's Next Big Thing|publisher=Huffington Post|work=HuffPost Entertainment|date=April 10, 2009|access-date=August 8, 2015|author=Sachs, Tony|archive-date=September 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925011859/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tony-sachs/50-years-late-connie-conv_b_173386.html|url-status=live}}</ref> That same month, ''Spinning on Air'' broadcast an hour-long special about Converse's life and music.

Apart from her 1954 appearance on ''The Morning Show'' and a performance of her music in 1961 by folksinger [[Susan Reed (singer)|Susan Reed]] at the Kaufmann Concert Hall in New York, Converse's music was not available to the public until it resurfaced in 2004.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.broadcastnewsroom.com/article/Elias-Arts-and-LauDerette-Recordings-Restore-and-Release-Music-from-50s-Singer-Connie-Converse-730257|title=Elias Arts and LauDerette Recordings Restore and Release Music from 50s Singer Connie Converse|publisher=Broadcast Newsroom|date=April 28, 2009|access-date=August 8, 2015|archive-date=September 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923194659/http://www.broadcastnewsroom.com/article/Elias-Arts-and-LauDerette-Recordings-Restore-and-Release-Music-from-50s-Singer-Connie-Converse-730257|url-status=live}}</ref> Since the 2009 release of her album, however, Converse's life and music have been the subject of news reports around the world.<ref name=RF/><ref name=PHB>{{cite web|url=http://www.jotdown.es/2014/10/vine-cante-desapareci/|title=Vine, canté, desaparecí|publisher=Jotdown|date=October 2014|access-date=August 9, 2015|author=Pablo Hernández Blanco|archive-date=June 28, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628060324/http://www.jotdown.es/2014/10/vine-cante-desapareci/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://focus.levif.be/culture/musique/l-album-de-la-semaine-connie-converse-how-sad-how-lovely/article-review-401749.html|title=L'album de la semaine: Connie Converse – How Sad, How Lovely|work=Focus Vif|date=June 22, 2015|agency=Focus|access-date=August 8, 2015|author=Broquet, Julien|location=France|archive-date=July 17, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717135653/http://focus.levif.be/culture/musique/l-album-de-la-semaine-connie-converse-how-sad-how-lovely/article-review-401749.html|url-status=live}}</ref> In addition to the mystery surrounding her disappearance, many of these articles focus on the content and style of Converse's music—and the possibility that she may be the earliest performer in the singer-songwriter genre.<ref name=IY/><ref name=DG/><ref name=PHB/><ref name=RF/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rebeatmag.com/5-reasons-connie-converse-is-the-most-interesting-female-musician-youve-never-heard-of/|title=5 Reasons Connie Converse is the Most Interesting Female Musician You've Never Heard Of|publisher=Rebeat Mag|access-date=August 8, 2015|author=McEneaney, Andrea|archive-date=July 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725064006/http://www.rebeatmag.com/5-reasons-connie-converse-is-the-most-interesting-female-musician-youve-never-heard-of/|url-status=live}}</ref> According to Garland, "Converse wrote and sang back in the 1950s, long before singer-songwriter was a recognized category or style.

Converse's life and music have served as the inspiration for numerous contemporary artworks, including a play by [[Howard Fishman]], who also produced the album ''Connie's Piano Songs'' featuring music written but never recorded by Converse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conniespianosongs.com/liner-notes/|title=Liner Notes — Connie's Piano Songs|publisher=Conniespianosongs.com|date=August 3, 1924|access-date=March 17, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415011640/http://www.conniespianosongs.com/liner-notes/|archive-date=April 15, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Other works inspired by Converse include the modern dance piece "Empty Pockets" by John Heginbotham, which was performed at the [[Miller Theater]] in 2015; British singer Nat Johnson's "Roving Woman" tribute performances; as well as tribute performances of Converse's music by Jean Rohe and [[Diane Cluck]] as part of the ''Spinning on Air'' 25th-anniversary special.<ref name=IY/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/05/arts/dance/review-barnard-columbia-dances-at-the-miller-theater.html|title=Review: Barnard/Columbia Dances at the Miller Theater|work=New York Times Arts|date=May 4, 2015|agency=The New York Times|access-date=August 8, 2015|author=Seibert, Brian|archive-date=February 4, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210204215320/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/05/arts/dance/review-barnard-columbia-dances-at-the-miller-theater.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/254236-spinning-on-air-in-the-greene-space-with-yoko-ono-john-zorn-and-others/|title=Spinning On Air in The Greene Space with Yoko Ono, John Zorn, and others|publisher=WNYC|work=Spinning on Air|date=December 12, 2012|access-date=August 8, 2015|archive-date=August 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810175001/http://www.wnyc.org/story/254236-spinning-on-air-in-the-greene-space-with-yoko-ono-john-zorn-and-others/|url-status=live}}</ref>
