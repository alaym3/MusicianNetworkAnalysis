'''Gideon''' ({{IPAc-en |ˈ|g|ɪ|d|i|ə|n}}; {{Hebrew Name|גִּדְעוֹן|Gīdʿōn|Gīḏəʿōn}}) also named '''Jerubbaal'''{{efn|{{lang|he|יְרֻבַּעַל |rtl=yes}} {{lang|he-Latn|Yərubaʿal}}}} and '''Jerubbesheth''',{{efn|{{lang|he|ירֻבֶּשָׁת|rtl=yes}} {{lang|he-Latn|Yərubešāṯ}}}}{{sfn|Cheyne|1901|p=}} was a military leader, [[biblical judges|judge]] and prophet whose calling and victory over the [[Midianites]] are recounted in {{bibleref2|Judges|6-8|NKJV}} of the [[Book of Judges]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]].

Gideon was the son of [[Joash the Abiezrite|Joash]], from the [[Abiezrite]] clan in the [[tribe of Manasseh]] and lived in [[Ophrah|Ephra (Ophrah)]].{{sfn|Gigot|1909}} As a leader of the [[Israelites]], he won a decisive victory over a Midianite army despite a vast numerical disadvantage, leading a troop of 300 "valiant" men.{{bibleref2c|Judges|7|NIV}}
Archaeologists in southern Israel have found a 3,100-year-old fragment of a jug with five letters written in ink that appear to represent the name Jerubbaal, or Yeruba'al.{{sfn|Gershon|2021}}

==Names==
The nineteenth-century [[Strong's Concordance]] derives the name "Jerubbaal" from "Baal will contend", in accordance with the folk etymology, given in {{bibleref2|Judges|6:32}}.<ref name=StrongH3378 />{{efn|name=Mud}} According to biblical scholar [[Lester L. Grabbe|Lester Grabbe]] (2007), "[Judges] 6.32 gives a nonsensical etymology of his name; it means something like 'Let Baal be great.{{'"}}{{sfn|Grabbe|2007|p=99}}

Likewise, where Strong gave the meaning "[[hewer]]" to the name Gideon, Biblical scholar Simon John DeVries (1975) suggests the etymology "driver".<ref name=StrongH1438 />{{sfn|DeVries|1975|p=79}}

The "besheth" part of the name "Jerubbesheth" (II Samuel 11:21) means "shame", a pious editorialization of "Baal" as is also found in Saul's son and grandson [[Mephibosheth]].<ref name="Mandelkern1937"> {{cite book|editor-first =Solomon | editor-last = Mandelkern|title=Heykhal ha-Ḳodesh/Veteris Testamenti Concordantiæ|publisher=Schocken|page=1474}}</ref>

According to modern scholars, the use of both names "Gideon" and "Jerubbaal" reflects two originally independent sets of stories combined by an editor who wishes them to be seen as referring to a single character.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=46}}{{sfn|DeVries|1975|p=79}}{{sfn|Amit|1999|p=102}}

==Biblical narrative==
[[File:Maarten van Heemskerck 024.jpg|thumb|upright|"[[Adam and Eve/Gideon and the Fleece|Gideon thanks God for the Miracle of the Dew]]", painting by [[Maarten van Heemskerck]] ([[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg]])]]
[[File:Schnorr von Carolsfeld Bibel in Bildern 1860 075.png|thumb|right|''Gideon's Call'', 1860 woodcut by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]]]]
As is the pattern throughout the [[Book of Judges]], the [[Israelites]] again turned away from [[Yahweh]] after 40 years of peace brought by [[Deborah]]'s victory over [[Canaan]], and [[Midian]]ites, [[Amalek]]ites and other [[Bedouin]] peoples harried Israel for seven years.<ref> Holman Bible Editorial Staff, ''Holman Concise Bible Dictionary'', B&H Publishing Group, USA, 2011, p. 264</ref> According to Louis Ginzberg's "The Legends of the Jews" "Elated by the victory over Sisera, Israel sang a hymn of praise, the song of Deborah, and God, to reward them for their pious
sentiments, pardoned the transgression of the people. But they soon slipped back into the old ways, and the old troubles harassed them. Their back-
sliding was due to the witchcraft of a Midianite priest named Aud. He made the sun shine at midnight, and so convinced the Israelites that the idols of Midian were mightier than God, and God chastised them by delivering them into the hands of the Midianties. They worshipped their own images reflected in the water, and they were stricken with dire poverty. They could not bring so much as a meal offering, the offering of the poor. On the eve of one Passover, Gideon uttered the complaint: "Where are all the wondrous works which God did for our fathers in this night, when he slew the first-born of the Egyptians, and Israel went forth from slavery with joyous hearts?" God appeared unto him, and said: "Thou who art courageous enough to champion Israel, thou art worthy that Israel should be saved for thy sake."<ref>[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2882/2882.txt Ginzberg's Legends of the Jews" pp.92-96]</ref>God chose Gideon, a young man from the [[tribe of Manasseh]], to free the people of Israel and to condemn their [[idolatry]]. The [[Angel of the Lord#Hebrew Bible|Angel of the Lord]], or "the Lord’s angelic messenger" ({{Bibleref2|Judges 6:11|NET}}) came "in the character ... of a traveller who sat down in the shade [of the terebinth tree] to enjoy a little refreshment and repose"<ref>[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/judges/6.htm Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary] on Judges 6, accessed 21 October 2016</ref> and entered into conversation with Gideon. The narrative has echoes of the meeting between [[Abraham]] and the visitors who came to him in the [[terebinth]]s of [[Mamre]] and promised Abraham and [[Sarah]], in their old age, that they would have a son ({{Bibleref2|Genesis 18:1-15}}).

The Angel of the Lord greeted Gideon:
{{quote|The Lord is with you, you mighty man of valor!}}

Gideon requested proof of God's will by three miracles: firstly a sign from the Angel of the Lord, in which the angel appeared to Gideon and caused fire to shoot up out of a rock ({{Bibleref2|Judges 6:11-22}}), and then two signs involving a [[Wool|fleece]], performed on consecutive nights and the exact opposite of each other. First waking to his fleece covered in dew, but the surrounding ground dry. Then the next morning, his fleece dry but the surrounding ground covered in dew.  ({{Bibleref2|Judges 6:36-40}}).

On God's instruction, Gideon destroyed the town's altar to [[Baal]] and the symbol of the goddess [[Asherah]] beside it, receiving the byname of ''Jerubbaal'' from his father:
{{quote|Therefore on that day he (Joash) called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.||{{Bibleref2|Judges 6:32}}}}

He went on to send out messengers to gather together men from the tribes of [[tribe of Asher|Asher]], [[tribe of Zebulun|Zebulun]], and [[tribe of Naphtali|Naphtali]], as well as his own tribe of Manasseh, in order to meet an armed force of the people of Midian and the Amalek that had crossed the [[Jordan River]], and they encamped at the [[Well of Harod]] in the [[Valley of Jezreel]]. But God informed Gideon that the men he had gathered were too many – with so many men, there would be reason for the Israelites to claim the victory as their own instead of acknowledging that God had saved them. God first instructed Gideon to send home those men who were afraid. Gideon invited any man who wanted to leave, to do so; 22,000 men returned home and 10,000 remained. Yet with the number, God told Gideon they were still too many and instructed him to bring them to the water. All those who lap the water with their tongues, as a dog laps, you shall put to one side; all those who kneel down to drink, putting their hands to their mouths, you shall put to the other side. The number of those that lapped up the water raised to their mouths by hand was three hundred; but all the rest of the troops knelt down to drink water. <ref>for an explantion of this division see [https://www.aish.com/sp/pg/83524782.html Honor and Disgrace:Ethnics of Fathers 4:8 Aish.Torah]</ref> Then the Lord said to Gideon, “With the three hundred that lapped I will deliver you, and give the Midianites into your hand. Let all the others go to their homes.” ({{Bibleref2|Judges 7:4–7}}).

===Night attack===
During the night, God instructed Gideon to approach the Midianite camp. There, Gideon overheard a Midianite man tell a friend of a dream in which "a loaf of [[barley bread]] tumbled into the camp of Midian" ({{Bibleref2|Judges 7:13}}), causing their tent or camp to collapse. This was interpreted as meaning that God had given the Midianites over to Gideon. Gideon returned to the Israelite camp and gave each of his men a trumpet (''[[shofar]]'') and a clay jar with a torch hidden inside. Divided into three companies, Gideon and his 300 men marched on the enemy camp. He instructed them to blow the trumpet, give a battle cry and light torches, simulating an attack by a large force. As they did so, the Midianite army fled ({{Bibleref2 |Judges 7:17–22}}).

Gideon sent messengers ahead into Israel calling for the [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraimites]] to pursue the retreating Midianites and two of their leaders, [[Oreb and Zeeb]]. Gideon and the three hundred pursued [[Zebah and Zalmunna]], the two Midianite kings. When he had asked for provisions in his pursuit, the men of [[Sukkot (place) |Succoth]] and [[Peniel (biblical) |Peniel]] refused and taunted Gideon. After capturing the two kings, Gideon punished the men of Succoth, and pulled down the tower of Peniel killing all the men there.  Gideon invited his eldest son, [[Jether]], to slay Zebah and Zalmunna, but being still young at the time, he did not have the confidence to carry out his father's request, so Zebah and Zalmunna called on Gideon to perform the deed himself. Gideon then killed Zebah and Zalmunna as justice for the death of his brothers ({{Bibleref2 |Judges 8:19–21}}). The place where Gideon slew Oreb after the defeat of the Midianites was called the ''Rock of Oreb''. It was probably the place now called Orbo, on the east of Jordan, near [[Bethshean]]. Zeeb was killed at "the wine press of Zeeb".

The Israelites invited Gideon to become their king and to found a [[dynasty]], but he refused, telling them that only God was their ruler ({{Bibleref2|Judges 8:22–23}}). [[G. A. Cooke]], writing in the [[Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges]] notes the discontinuity between Ephraimite anger towards Gideon shown in {{Bibleref2|Judges 8:1–3}} and the proposition of kingship over [all] Israel, and therefore concludes that "these verses appear to come from a [secondary] source".<ref>[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/judges/8.htm Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges], Judges 8, accessed 27 October 2016</ref>

Gideon went on to make an ''[[ephod]]'' out of the gold won in battle; according to Lois Ginzberg's "The Legends of the Jews" "..In the high priest's breastplate, Joseph was represented among the twelve tribes by Ephraim alone, not by Manasseh, too. To wipe out this slight upon his own tribe, Gideon made an ephod bearing the name of Manasseh. He consecrated it to God, but after his death homage was paid to it as an idol. In those days the Israelites were so addicted to the worship of Beelzebub that they constantly carried small images of this god with them in their pockets, and every now and then they were in the habit of bringing the image forth and kissing it fervently."<ref>[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2882/2882.txt Ginzberg Legends of the Jews pp.101-102]</ref>; according to the Bible this action eventually caused the whole of Israel to turn away from God yet again and the ruin of Gideon and his family. Gideon had 70 sons from the many women he took as wives. He also had a [[Shechem]]ite concubine who bore him a son whom he named [[Abimelech (Judges) |Abimelech]], which means "my father is king" ({{Bibleref2|Judges 8:31}}).

There was peace in Israel for 40 years during the life of Gideon. As soon as Gideon died of old age, the Israelites again turned to worship the false god [[Baal Berith]] and ignored the family of Gideon ({{Bibleref2|Judges 8:33}}). [[Louis Ginzberg]]'s [[Midrash]] [[anthology]] ''[[The Legends of the Jews]]'' records the following remarks on Abimelech: "[[Tanhuma]] B 1 103. The parable of [[Jotham]] is said to refer to the prominent judges: [[Othniel]] [=Olive tree], [[Deborah]] [=fig tree], Gideon [=vine], and [[Elimelech]] [=bramble]. Tan. also states that Abimelech reigned for three years, as a reward for the modesty of his father Gideon, who in a "tripartite"  sentence refused the royal crown offered him by his people; see Jud. 8.23. Abimelech, in contrast to his father [Jud.8.27], was very greedy for riches, and his end therefore came speedily; Aggadat Bereshit 26, 54., see also ibid., 52-53 where Abimelech's wickedness and greed was contrasted with the piety and liberality  of his namesake Abimelech, the King of Getar. The ingratitude of the  Israelites who permitted Abimelech to murder the children of their benefactor Gideon was counted unto them as though they had forsaken God; ingratitude is as grave a sin as idolatry; [[Yelammedenu]] in Yalkut II, 64."{{sfn|Szold|Radin|1998|p=201}}

==Textual history==
In the early twentieth century, the text of Judges 6–8 was regarded by the "critical school" as a composite narrative, combining [[Jahwist]], [[Elohist]] and [[Deuteronomic]] sources, with further interpolations and editorial comments of the [[Second Temple period]].{{sfn|Hirsch|1906}} [[Emil G. Hirsch]] alleged a historical nucleus in the narrative, reflecting the struggle of the [[tribe of Manasseh]] with hostile Bedouins across the Jordan, along with "reminiscences of tribal jealousies on the part of Ephraim" in the early period of Hebrew settlement, later conflated with the religious context of connecting Yahweh with the shrine at Ophrah.{{sfn|Hirsch|1906}}

The D source or (D) material has an overwhelming presence in Judges 6–8. The earlier source material used is present. However, the message and theological view has the style of the Deuteronomistic school of Authors.{{sfn|Niditch|2008|p=10}} The core (Jahwist) narrative consists of Gideon wishing to avenge the death of his brothers, gathering 300 men of his own clan and pursuing the Midianite chiefs Zebah and Zalmunna, slaying them and consecrating an idol (''ephod'') made from the spoils of war, which makes his city of Ophrah the seat of an oracle and giving Gideon himself the status of a rich chief with a large harem (Judges 8:4–10a, 11–21, 24–27a, 29–32).{{sfn|Hirsch|1906}}

The name Jerubbaal given to Gideon is originally a theophoric name meaning "Baal strives", but it was later given the interpretation of "let Baal strive against him" in order to avoid conflict with the more rigorous development of the religion of Yahweh in later centuries.{{efn|name=PurFra}}

==Christian reception==
[[File:Unicorn annunciation.jpg|thumb|upright|Gideon's fleece, as symbol of Mary, in a "Hunt of the Unicorn [[Annunciation]]" (ca. 1500) from a Netherlandish [[book of hours]]. For the complicated [[iconography]], see [[Hortus Conclusus]].]]
In the [[New Testament]], Gideon is mentioned in chapter 11 of the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] as an example of a man of faith, one of several "heroes of faith" mentioned there:<ref>[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/11.htm Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges] on Hebrews 11, accessed 16 January 2017</ref>
{{Quote | Time would fail me to tell of Gideon [and others] who through faith subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became valiant in battle, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.<ref>{{bibleverse||Hebrews|11:32–34|NKJV}}</ref>}}

He is also made reference to in chapter 28 of [[Meqabyan#First Book of Ethiopian Maccabees (Meqabyan 1)|1 Meqabyan]], a book considered [[Orthodox Tewahedo biblical canon|canonical]] in the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://torahofyeshuah.blogspot.com/2015/07/book-of-meqabyan-i-iii.html|title = Torah of Yeshuah: Book of Meqabyan I - III}}</ref>

Gideon is regarded as a [[saint]] by Eastern Orthodox, Eastern Catholic and Latin Rite Catholic Churches. He is also commemorated, together with the other righteous figures of the Old Testament, on the Sunday before Christmas (Fourth Sunday of [[Advent]]). He is commemorated as one of the [[Saints]] of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] on July 30, and in the [[Roman Martyrology]] of the Latin Rite on September 26.

In the [[Protestant Reformation]], the Gideon narrative was employed in polemics against the Catholic clergy. [[Hans von Rüte]]'s ''Gideon'' (1540) compares the removal of saints' relics from churches to Gideon's destruction of Baal's altar.

[[Gideons International]] is an American organization dedicated to Christian evangelism, founded in 1899, dedicated to the distribution of free Bibles. The organization's logo represents a two-handled pitcher and torch, symbolizing the implements used by Gideon to scare the Midianite army.

==Military references==
Much like the 300 Spartans [[Battle of Thermopylae|at Thermopylae]], Gideon has become symbolic of military success of a small elite force against overwhelming numerical odds.
The 12th-century ''[[Poem of Almería]]'' invokes "the strength of Samson and the sword of Gideon" in the context of the [[Reconquista]] of [[Almería]] led by [[Ponce Giraldo de Cabrera]] (1147).
[[Benedikt Gletting]] (16th century) invokes the "Sword of Gideon" in a call for a pious and confident defense of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] against the threat of the [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.5169/seals-117277|doi = 10.5169/seals-117277|year = 1978|last1 = Schwarzenbach|first1 = Rudolf|title = "...

The [[Gideon Force]] was a small British-led  special force in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] during World War II. [[El Junquito raid]] code-named Operation Gideon in 2018 and [[Operation Gideon (2020)]] were dissident military operations in Venezuela.
