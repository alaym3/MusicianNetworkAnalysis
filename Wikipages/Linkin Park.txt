During an Instagram live chat on December 17, 2017, Shinoda was asked whether Linkin Park would perform with a hologram version of Bennington in the future. He replied, "Can we not do a holographic Chester? I can't even wrap my head around the idea of a holographic Chester. I've actually heard other people outside the band suggest that, and there's absolutely no way.

On January 28, 2018, Shinoda replied to a tweet from a fan inquiring about his future with Linkin Park, writing "I have every intention on continuing with LP, and the guys feel the same.

On February 18, 2019, Shinoda said in an interview that the band is open to the idea of continuing though what form that takes has yet to be decided. Shinoda stated "I know the other guys, they love to be onstage, they love to be in a studio, and so to not do that would be like, I don't know, almost like unhealthy." When asked about the band's future minus Bennington, Shinoda stated, "It's not my goal to look for a new singer. If it does happen, it has to happen naturally. If we find someone that is a great person and good stylistic fit, I could see trying to do some stuff with somebody. I would never want to feel like we are replacing Chester."<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=Mike Shinoda Open to Finding New Linkin Park Vocalist |url=http://loudwire.com/mike-shinoda-open-finding-new-linkin-park-vocalist/ |magazine=Loudwire |access-date=February 19, 2019 |archive-date=November 21, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201121163550/https://loudwire.com/mike-shinoda-open-finding-new-linkin-park-vocalist/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The vocal interplay between Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda plays as a major part within Linkin Park's music, with Bennington being the lead vocalist and Shinoda as the [[rapping]] vocalist. On Linkin Park's third album, ''Minutes to Midnight'', Shinoda sings lead vocals on "In Between", "Hands Held High", and on the B-side "No Roads Left". On numerous songs from band's fourth album, ''[[A Thousand Suns]]'', such as the album's singles ("[[The Catalyst]]", "[[Burning in the Skies]]", "[[Iridescent (song)|Iridescent]]"), both Shinoda and Bennington sing. The album has been regarded as a turning point in the band's musical career, having a stronger emphasis on electronica.<ref name="reflectionsofdarkness1">{{cite web|url=http://www.reflectionsofdarkness.com/artists-k-o-cdreviews-133/8220-linkin-park-a-thousand-suns.html |title=Linkin Park – A Thousand Suns |publisher=Reflectionsofdarkness.com |date=September 17, 2010 |access-date=January 2, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619232916/http://www.reflectionsofdarkness.com/artists-k-o-cdreviews-133/8220-linkin-park-a-thousand-suns.html |archive-date=June 19, 2015}}</ref><ref name="killyourstereo1">{{cite web |url=http://www.killyourstereo.com/reviews/488/linkin-park-a-thousand-suns/ |title=Linkin Park – A Thousand Suns &#124; Reviews |publisher=Kill Your Stereo |access-date=January 2, 2012 |archive-date=March 30, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330165623/http://www.killyourstereo.com/reviews/488/linkin-park-a-thousand-suns/ |url-status=live }}</ref> James Montgomery, of MTV, compared the record to [[Radiohead]]'s ''[[Kid A]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1646930/20100831/linkin_park.jhtml |title=Linkin Park's A Thousand Suns: Kid A, All Grown Up? |last=Montgomery |first=James |date=September 6, 2010 |access-date=September 9, 2010 |archive-date=September 3, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903171649/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1646930/20100831/linkin_park.jhtml |url-status=live }}</ref> while Jordy Kasko of ''Review, Rinse, Repeat'' likened the album to both ''Kid A'' and [[Pink Floyd]]'s landmark album ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]''.<ref name="Jordy Kasko">{{cite web|url= http://www.reviewrinserepeat.com/artist/linkin-park/album/a-thousand-suns/review|title= Linkin Park – A Thousand Suns|last= Kasko|first= Jordy|date= September 10, 2010|access-date= September 11, 2010|archive-date= October 1, 2018|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181001222817/http://www.reviewrinserepeat.com/artist/linkin-park/album/a-thousand-suns/review|url-status= live}}</ref> Shinoda stated that he and the other band members were deeply influenced by [[Chuck D]] and [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]].
