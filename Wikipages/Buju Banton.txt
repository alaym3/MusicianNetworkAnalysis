==Biography==
===Background===
Buju Banton was born in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], Jamaica in an area known as Barbican Road, Kingston 8. Buju is a nickname given to him by his mother as a child. ''Banton'' is a Jamaican word that refers to someone who is a respected storyteller, and it was adopted by Myrie in tribute to the [[Deejay (Jamaican)|deejay]] [[Burro Banton]], whom he admired as a child.<ref name="Thompson">Thompson, Dave (2002) "Reggae & Caribbean Music", Backbeat Books, {{ISBN|0-87930-655-6}}</ref> Buju emulated Burro's rough vocals and forceful delivery, developing his own distinctive style. Buju's mother was a [[higgler]], or [[street vendor]], while his father worked as a labourer at a [[tile]] factory. He was the youngest of fifteen children born into a family that was directly descended from the [[maroon (people)|Maroons]] of Jamaica.

Banton has homes in [[Jamaica]] and [[Tamarac, Florida]] (United States).<ref>"[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/960784/buju-banton-pleads-not-guilty-to-drug-charge Buju Banton Pleads Not Guilty To Drug Charge]", billboard.com, 8 January 2010.

===Early career===
As a youngster, Buju would often watch his favourite artists perform at outdoor shows and local dancehalls in [[Denham Town]]. At the age of 12, he picked up the [[microphone]] for himself and began [[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]] under the moniker of [[Gargamel]], working with the Sweet Love and Rambo Mango [[Sound system (Jamaican)|sound systems]].<ref name="Thompson" /> In 1986, he was introduced to producer [[Robert Ffrench]] by fellow deejay Clement Irie, and his first single, "The Ruler" was released not long afterward in 1987.<ref name="Thompson" /> This led to recording sessions with producers such as Patrick Roberts, [[Bunny Lee]], [[Winston Riley]], and Digital B.

===1990s===
In 1991, Buju joined [[Donovan Germain]]'s [[Penthouse Records]] label and began a fruitful partnership with producer [[Dave Kelly (producer)|Dave Kelly]] who later launched his own [[Madhouse Records]] label.<ref name="Thompson" /> Buju is one of the most popular musicians in [[History of Jamaica|Jamaican history]], having major chart success in 1992, with "Bogle" and "Love me [[Jamaican Patois|Browning]]", both massive hits in Jamaica. Controversy erupted over "Love Me Browning" which spoke of Banton's penchant for lighter-skinned black women: "Mi love my car mi love my bike mi love mi money and ting, but most of all mi love mi browning." Some accused Banton of denigrating the beauty of darker-skinned black women. In response, he released "Love Black Woman", which spoke of his love for dark-skinned beauties: "Mi nuh Stop cry, fi all black women, respect all the girls dem with dark [[complexion]]".<ref name="Barrow">Barrow, Steve & Dalton, Peter (2004) "The Rough Guide to Reggae, 3rd edn.", Rough Guides, {{ISBN|1-84353-329-4}}</ref> 1992 was an explosive year for Buju as he broke [[Bob Marley]]'s record for the greatest number of #1 singles in a year. Buju's gruff voice dominated the Jamaican airwaves for the duration of the year. Banton's debut album, ''[[Mr. Mention]]'', includes many of his greatest hits from that year including "Bonafide Love" featuring Wayne Wonder, the singer who first brought Buju out as a guest star on the annual Jamaican stage show Sting. 1992 also saw the unsanctioned re-release of "Boom Bye Bye", a controversial song recorded several years earlier when the artist was 15 years old, which resulted in a backlash that threatened to destroy his career.<ref name="Thompson" /> several years later, the song would later become the subject of outrage in the United States and Europe, leading to Banton being dropped from the line-up of the [[World of Music, Arts and Dance|WOMAD]] festival as well as numerous other scheduled performances.<ref name="Thompson" /> Banton subsequently issued a public apology.<ref name="Thompson" />

Now on the major [[Mercury Records|Mercury]]/[[PolyGram]] label, Banton released the hard-hitting ''[[Voice of Jamaica]]'' in 1993. The album included a number of conscious tracks. These tracks included "Deportees", a song which criticises those Jamaicans who went abroad but never sent money home; "Tribal War" a collaboration with [[Tony Rebel]], [[Brian and Tony Gold|Brian & Tony Gold]], and Terry Ganzie, a sharp condemnation of political violence that interpolates [[Little Roy]]'s classic reggae song of the same name; and "Willy, Don't Be Silly", which promotes [[safe sex]] and the use of [[contraceptives]], particularly the [[condom]], profits from which were donated to a charity supporting children with [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]].<ref name="Thompson" /> Banton was invited to meet Jamaican Prime Minister [[P. J. Patterson]], and won several awards that year at the Caribbean Music Awards and the Canadian Music Awards.<ref name="Thompson" />

Some of Banton's lyrics dealt with violent themes, which he explained as reflecting the images that young Jamaicans were presented with by the news media. The reality of Kingston's violence was brought home in 1993 by the murders in separate incidents of three of his friends and fellow recording artists, the deejays [[Pan Head]] and Dirtsman and singer Mickey Simpson.<ref name="Thompson" /> His response was the single "Murderer", which condemned gun violence, going against the flow of the prevailing lyrical content in dancehall. The song inspired several clubs to stop playing songs with the excessively violent subject matter. Late in 1994, Buju was also affected by the death of his friend [[Garnett Silk]]. Buju's transformation continued, as he embraced the [[Rastafari movement]] and began growing [[dreadlocks]]. His performances and musical releases took on a [http://www.boomshots.com/index.php/2014/07/reasoning-with-buju-banton-my-life-is-an-open-book/ more spiritual tone]. Banton toured Europe and Japan, playing sold-out shows.

''[['Til Shiloh]]'' (1995) was a very influential album, incorporating live instrumentation as well as digital rhythms, and incorporating the sounds of [[roots reggae]] along with the harder-edged dancehall sounds that first made Banton famous. The artist was embracing his Rastafari faith and his new album reflected these beliefs. ''Til Shiloh'' successfully blended conscious lyrics with a hard-hitting dancehall vibe. The album included earlier singles such as "Murderer" along with instant classics like "Wanna Be Loved" and "[[Untold Stories (Buju Banton song)|Untold Stories]]". "Untold Stories" revealed an entirely different side of Buju Banton from the one that had stormed to dancehall stardom. It is regarded by many as one of his best works and has become a staple in the Banton performance repertoire. Reminiscent in mood and delivery to "[[Redemption Song]]" by [[Bob Marley]], "Untold Stories" won Buju Banton many favorable comparisons to the late singer. This album had a profound impact on dancehall music and proved that dancehall audiences had not forgotten the message that Roots Reggae expounded with the use of "conscious lyrics". Dancehall artists did not abandon slack and violent lyrics altogether, but the album did pave the way for a greater spirituality within the music. In the wake of Buju's transformation to [[Rastafari]], many artists, such as [[Capleton]], embraced the faith and began to denounce violence in their music.

In 1996, Buju contributed "Wanna Be Loved (Desea ser Amado)" along with [[Los Pericos]] to the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s album ''[[Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin]]'' for the [[Red Hot Benefit Series]]. This series raises money to increase AIDS awareness.

That same year Buju Banton took control of his business by establishing his own Gargamel Music label, releasing the popular single "Love Sponge" on vinyl in Jamaica and overseas. In years to come Gargamel would expand into an outlet for Buju's own productions and providing an outlet for fresh new talent.

''[[Inna Heights]]'' (1997) substantially increased Banton's international audience as Buju explored his singing ability and recorded a number of [[roots reggae|roots]]-tinged tracks, including the hugely popular "Destiny" and "Hills and Valleys". The album also included collaborations with artists such as [[Beres Hammond]] and the legendary [[Toots Hibbert]]. The album was well received by fans at the time and critics praised Buju's soaring vocals. The album has aged well and remains a highly regarded work over 20 years after its release.

In 1998, Buju met the [[Punk rock|punk]] band [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] and recorded three tracks with them: "No More Misty Days", "Hooligans" and "Life Won't Wait". The latter became the title track of Rancid's 1998 album ''[[Life Won't Wait]]''.

===2000s===
[[File:Buju Banton (Apollo theater, 2007).jpg|thumb|right|150px|Buju Banton performing in 2007.]]
Buju signed with [[Anti- (record label)|Anti- Records]], a subsidiary of [[Brett Gurewitz]]'s [[Epitaph Records]], and released ''[[Unchained Spirit]]'' in 2000.<ref name="Moskowitz">Moskowitz, David V. (2006) ''Caribbean Popular Music: an Encyclopedia of Reggae, Mento, Ska, Rock Steady, and Dancehall'', Greenwood Press, {{ISBN|0-313-33158-8}}, p.20</ref> The album showcased diverse musical styles, and featured guest appearances by [[Luciano (singer)|Luciano]], [[Morgan Heritage]], [[Stephen Marley (musician)|Stephen Marley]], and [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]]. It carried little of the roots feel heard on ''Til Shiloh'' and virtually none of the hardcore dancehall sound which had brought him to public acclaim early in his career.

Several singles followed in the start of the new decade, which was perceived as more mellow and introspective, as opposed to the dancehall approach of his early career. In March 2003, Banton released ''[[Friends for Life (Buju Banton album)|Friends for Life]]'', which featured more sharply political songs, including "Mr. Nine", an anti-gun song that was a hit in Jamaica's dancehalls as well as internationally.<ref>Spaulding, Gary.

''Jamaica Gleaner''.  13 December 2009. Retrieved 28 February 2011.</ref> The album focused on political messages regarding the [[African diaspora]], featuring excerpts from a speech made by [[Marcus Garvey]]. "Paid Not Played", also featured on the album, displayed a gradual return to the themes more popular in dancehall. The album also featured some [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] influence with the inclusion of rapper [[Fat Joe]].

2006 saw the release of the ''[[Too Bad (album)|Too Bad]]'', an album that was more dancehall-oriented in style. One of the slower tracks from the album, "Driver A", went on to become a major hit, while at the same time reviving [[Sly and Robbie]]'s "Taxi" [[riddim]].

Banton performed at the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]] Opening Ceremony with [[Third World (band)|Third World]] and [[Beres Hammond]].

The album ''Rasta Got Soul'' was released on 21 April 2009, a date which marked the 43rd anniversary of Emperor [[Haile Selassie]]'s visit to Jamaica in 1966. Produced by Banton, with contributions from longtime collaborators [[Donovan Germain]], Stephen Marsden and [[Wyclef Jean]], ''Rasta Got Soul'' was a 100% roots reggae album recorded over a seven-year period before its release. It went on to earn Banton his fourth Grammy nomination for Best Reggae Album in 2010.

===2010s===

On 13 February 2011, one day before the scheduled start of his second court trial in [[Tampa, Florida]], Buju Banton's ''Before the Dawn'' album was announced as the winner of Best Reggae Album at the [[53rd Annual Grammy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Buju-to-be-re-indicted-before-grand-jury |title=Buju to be re-indicted before grand jury – News |publisher=JamaicaObserver.com |date=29 September 2010 |access-date=19 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628183549/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Buju-to-be-re-indicted-before-grand-jury |archive-date=28 June 2011}}</ref>

The song was recorded at the Gargamel Music Studio, Donovan Germain's own recording studio in the Corporate Area. On 12 November of the same year, he released his first official music video entitled “Trust”. The video marked the first anniversary of Banton's release from prison and was produced in collaboration with [[Dave Kelly (producer)|Dave Kelly]] and directed by Kieran Khan.

===2020s===

In January 2020, Buju was featured on the ''[[Bad Boys for Life (soundtrack)]]'' which was produced by [[DJ Khaled]]. His song titled "Murda She Wrote" was a nod to a 1992 dancehall classic called "[[Murder She Wrote (song)|Murder She Wrote]]" by Jamaican reggae duo [[Chaka Demus & Pliers]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dancehallmag.com/2020/01/17/music/buju-banton-releases-murda-she-wrote-featured-on-bad-boys-for-life-soundtrack.html|title=Buju Banton Releases 'Murda She Wrote' Featured On 'Bad Boys For Life' Soundtrack|date=17 January 2020|website=DancehallMag|language=en-US|access-date=18 February 2020}}</ref>

==Controversies==
===Anti-gay controversy===
Banton has been criticised for the lyrical content of his song "Boom Bye Bye", which was released when he was 19 years old in 1992. The song has been interpreted as supporting the murder of [[gay men]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Nelson |first=Leah |url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2010/winter/harmonies-of-hate |title=Jamaica's Anti-Gay 'Murder Music' Carries Violent Message &#124; Southern Poverty Law Center |publisher=Splcenter.org |access-date=19 February 2013}}</ref> In 2009, gay-rights groups appealed to venues around the United States not to host Buju Banton.<ref>GLN MURDER MUSIC NEWS [http://www.gayliberation.net/murdermusic/2009/0830bujubantontour.html "Buju Banton's 2009 U.S.A. tour: Canceled Shows & Current Bookings"]</ref>

In 2007, Banton was allegedly among a number of reggae artists who signed a pledge, called the Reggae Compassionate Act, created by the [[Stop Murder Music]] campaign, to refrain from performing [[homophobic]] songs or making homophobic statements.<ref>Topping, Alexandra.

I recognize that the song has caused much pain to listeners, as well as to my fans, my family and myself. After all the adversity we've been through I am determined to put this song in the past and continue moving forward as an artist and as a man. I affirm once and for all that everyone has the right to live as they so choose. In the words of the great Dennis Brown, 'Love and hate can never be friends.' I welcome everyone to my shows in a spirit of peace and love. Please come join me in that same spirit."<ref>[https://genius.com/a/buju-banton-has-permanently-removed-the-infamously-homophobic-boom-bye-bye-from-his-catalog "Buju Banton Has Permanently Removed The Infamously Homophobic 'Boom Bye Bye' From His Catalog"], [[Genius (website)|Genius]], 22 March 2019.</ref>
