James|publisher=[[Florida Department of Corrections]]|access-date=January 8, 2021}}</ref> is an American murderer and sex offender. His appearance on the national television show ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'' led to his capture and [[conviction]] for the killings of an 8-year-old girl and her grandmother in September 1993.

== Biography ==
James was born in [[Bristol, Pennsylvania]].<ref>Walsh, p. 4</ref> He believed his last name was Matlack until the age of 10, when he discovered that the man raising him was his stepfather. At 11, James met and went to live with his biological father, who introduced him to drugs. Ironically, his father was a [[Intervention (counseling)|drug counselor]].<ref>Walsh, pp. 4-5 "And here's the sick irony: Eddie's dad was a drug counselor. 'He made a joke out of how he was a drug counselor and he did more drugs than the people he was counseling,' Eddie remembered."</ref> In his mid-teens, James returned to live with his mother in [[Casselberry, Florida]]. His life now revolved around fighting and drugs, and he claimed to be having [[Anterograde amnesia|blackouts]]. His mother sought assistance from a [[mental health counselor]]; however, his violence and anger continued.<ref>Walsh, pp. 5-6</ref>

James dropped out of high school in his junior year and joined the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] when he was 17. He was stationed in Germany but was soon [[Military discharge|discharged]] for "failure to conform".<ref>Walsh, p. 6</ref> James returned to Casselberry, where he became friends with a man named Tim Dick. James was welcomed into Dick's extended family, and, in the summer of 1993, he rented a room from Dick's mother, Betty.<ref>Walsh, p. 7</ref><ref>Edward James vs. State of Florida, p. 3</ref>

== Murders ==
On September 20, 1993, James returned home from a party to find Betty Dick's four grandchildren sleeping in the living room.<ref>Edward James vs. State of Florida, pp. 4-5</ref> He grabbed 8-year-old Toni Neuner by the neck and [[Choking|choked]] her, then took her to his bedroom and raped her, after which he put her body between his bed and the wall.<ref name=Walsh>Walsh</ref><ref name="Page 5">Edward James vs. State of Florida, p. 5</ref>

James proceeded to Dick's bedroom, where he hit her in the head with a candlestick and repeatedly stabbed her with a knife. Dick screamed, waking up Toni's sister, 9-year-old Wendi, who came to the bedroom.<ref name="orlando">{{cite news|last1=Brooks|first1=Mary|title='Most Wanted' Eddie James Jailed In California|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-10-07/news/9310070359_1_eddie-james-casselberry-police-valdez|access-date=April 21, 2017|work=tribunedigital-orlandosentinel|publisher=Orlando Sentinel|date=October 7, 1993|language=en}}</ref> James tied Wendi up and put her in the bathroom.<ref>Edward James vs. State of Florida, p. 5 "Appellant turned around and saw Wendi at which point he grabbed her, tied her up, and placed her in the bathroom. Wendi asked Appellant if he was going to hurt her brothers, and Appellant told her, 'NO, I'm not going to hurt your brother or I'm not going to hurt you. You've been through enough pain.'"</ref> He got a [[butcher knife]] from the kitchen and returned to Dick's bedroom, sticking the knife in her back. After showering and taking jewelry from Dick's bedroom, James fled in her car.<ref name="Page 5"/>

==Apprehension and sentencing==
On September 28, 1993, ''America's Most Wanted'' (''AMW'') broadcast information related to the case, resulting in hundreds of viewer phone calls. Several tips indicated that he was traveling west. On October 5, 1993, ''AMW'' rebroadcast the details of the case, including this updated information. The next day, a viewer spotted James at the California state unemployment office in [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] and contacted authorities.<ref name=Walsh/> Once in police custody, he gave two taped statements.<ref>Edward James vs. State of Florida, p. 6</ref>

On April 5, 1995, James [[plea]]ded guilty to two counts of [[Murder#Degrees of murder in the United States|first-degree murder]], and one count each of [[Aggravation (legal concept)|aggravated]] [[child abuse]], attempted [[Battery (crime)|sexual battery]], [[kidnapping]], [[grand theft]] and [[Motor vehicle theft|grand theft auto]]. He also pleaded [[Nolo contendere|no contest]] to two counts of capital sexual battery charged by separate information.<ref>Edward James vs. State of Florida, p. 1</ref>

On August 18, 1995, James was sentenced to [[Capital punishment|death]] for the murders of Toni Neuner and Betty Dick, as well sentences ranging from 15 years to [[Life imprisonment|life]] on the other charges.<ref>Edward James vs. State of Florida, p. 2</ref> He is incarcerated at [[Union Correctional Institution]] in [[Raiford, Florida]].
