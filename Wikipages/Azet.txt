'''Azet ''' is a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Hautes-Pyrénées]] [[Departments of France|department]] in the [[Occitanie]] region of south-western [[France]].

The inhabitants of the commune are known as ''Azetois'' or ''Azetoises''.<ref>[http://www.habitants.fr/habitants_departement_hautes-pyrenees_65.html Inhabitants of Hautes-Pyrénées] {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

==Geography==
Azet is located some 55&nbsp;km south by south-east of [[Tarbes]] and 20&nbsp;km west of [[Bagnères-de-Luchon]]. Access to the commune is by road D225 from [[Estensan]] in the west to the village. The public square of the village is 1,172 metres above sea level at the intersection of the Aure and Louron valleys with the [[Col de Val Louron-Azet]] to the south-east.  The commune is very rugged and inaccessible with extensive forests in the south.<ref name=Google>[https://www.google.com/maps/place/Azet,+France/@42.7736545,0.3638585,13184m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x12a86c0b25055995:0x406f69c2f3d8a30?hl=en Google Maps]</ref>

The ''Ruisseau de Lustau'' flows north from the ''Lustou Lake'' in the south of the commune, gathering many tributaries including the ''Ruisseau de Sarrouyes'' which flows from lakes in the south-east of the commune, and becoming the ''Mousquere'' before passing the village and continuing north to join the [[Neste (river)|Neste d'Aure]] north of [[Vielle-Aure]].<ref name=Google/>

==Toponymy==
The probable etymology of the name is ''Adet, adou, ados, âne, asou'', then ''Azet'' meaning a place marking the end of the terrain which could only be crossed by donkey or horse.

==History==
[[File:Azet-Hautes-Pyrenees-en-hiver.JPG|thumb|Azet in winter]]
There is little evidence to trace the origin of the village except the church, which dates from the fourth quarter of the 12th century<ref name=Church/> In 1887 the village had two primary schools. Village resources were mainly [[pastoralism]] with livestock farming of sheep, cows, horses, and donkeys as well as crops such as wheat, rye, meslin, barley, buckwheat, beans, peas, potatoes, turnips, flax sprouts, and hay.

From the 1880s the population decreased due to the waves of [[typhoid fever]] during 1886-1887 and the [[rural exodus]] of young people.
