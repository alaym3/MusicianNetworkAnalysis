'''Empyrium''' is a [[Germany|German]] symphonic [[folk metal|folk]]/[[doom metal]] and (later) [[neofolk]]/[[dark folk]] band.

== History ==
Empyrium was founded in 1994 by [[Markus Stock (musician)|Markus Stock]] (mostly using the [[pseudonym]] [[Ulf Theodor Schwadorf]]) and Andreas Bach, but later many other musicians participated.

The band draws inspiration from [[nature]]. Empyrium are often referred to as a [[dark folk]] or [[apocalyptic folk]] band{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}, expressing in their music sentiments akin to those expressed by some other 'legislators' of the genre, [[Forseti (band)|Forseti]], [[Orplid]], and [[Ulver]] ([[Kveldssanger]]){{citation needed|date=March 2020}}.  Like the [[Norway|Norwegian]] black metal band [[Burzum]], Empyrium also used [[Theodor Kittelsen]]'s drawing on one of their album covers (''[[Where at Night the Wood Grouse Plays]]'').

=== Metal records ===
Their first two albums, ''A Wintersunset'' and ''Songs of Moors and Misty Fields'', following a demo entitled ''...Der wie ein Blitz vom Himmel fiel...'', are considered [[doom metal]] (or [[folk metal]]) with [[folk music|folk]] and [[symphony|symphonic]] influences. They combine [[Death growl|harsh]] and [[opera]]tic male [[vocals]], with deep slow [[guitar]] parts and atmospheric sounds.

=== Acoustic records ===
The following two albums, ''[[Where at Night the Wood Grouse Plays]]'' and ''[[Weiland (album)|Weiland]]'' are [[acoustic instrument|acoustic]], display a constantly heavier [[neofolk]] influence. Instead of keyboards, the band switched to acoustic instruments such as [[acoustic guitar]]s, [[violin]]s, [[cello]]s and the [[flute]]. Operatic male vocals are still used, and in ''Weiland'' the band uses choir vocals and the piano. Though the music remains dark and melancholic, Empyrium's music has largely moved away from [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]].

=== Departure ===
After their 2002 album, ''Weiland'', the band decided to stop recording. As Schwadorf himself put it,

<blockquote>
''Empyrium has explored nature-mystics since 1994, and after 8 years we feel to move on and made a glorious farewell to the concept with "Weiland"''<ref>[http://www.empyrium.de] {{dead link|date=October 2020}}</ref>
</blockquote>

=== ''A Retrospective'' ===

In August 2006, Empyrium's label, [[Prophecy Productions]], announced publicly for the first time that a new album was going to be released in late November the same year. Called ''A Retrospective'', it is a look back on the history of the band. Aside from ten remastered tracks from their previous albums, it contains a re-recorded version of ''The Franconian Woods In Winter's Silence'' from the album ''A Wintersunset'', as well as two new tracks in the [[neofolk]] style of late Empyrium (''Der Weiher'' and ''Am Wolkenstieg''). The sixty-page [[book]]let provides an extensive account of the musical influences of the band, and how Empyrium has changed over the years. The album leaked onto the [[Internet]] in early November 2006.

=== Comeback ===
On September 17, 2010, [[Prophecy Productions]] and Schwadorf personally announced that the band had reunited and revealed plans to release a new album soon, beside contributing to the label's upcoming v/a compilation ''[[Whom The Moon A Nightsong Sings]]''.<ref>[http://www.prophecyproductions.de/front_content.php?idcat=257&lang=1] {{dead link|date=October 2020}}</ref>

<blockquote>
We are incredibly happy to announce that Empyrium, the most renowned Prophecy act ever, has decided to reunite and to record new music! Here's the official statement of Schwadorf on the reunion: ''Since the rumours start to spread we think it's about time to make this official: Empyrium is alive again! Our first new sign of life will be the song 'The Days Before The Fall' on the Prophecy Prod. compilation 'Whom The Moon A Nightsong Sings' but we have plans for more! The spirit is back and it really feels right to us to start writing songs with Empyrium again. We are not in a rush though so don't expect a full length today or tomorrow but we have the patience and faith to make this new songs outstanding and unique. Just as Empyrium ever was...''<ref>[http://www.prophecyproductions.de/front_content.php?idcat=257&lang=1] {{dead link|date=October 2020}}</ref>
