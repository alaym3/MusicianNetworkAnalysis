'''StarKid Productions''', also known as '''Team StarKid''',  is an American [[musical theatre]] company founded in 2009 at the [[University of Michigan]] by [[Darren Criss]], Brian Holden, Matt Lang, and Nick Lang. Originally known for the viral success of their first musical, ''[[A Very Potter Musical]]'', a parody of the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, the troupe primarily produces musical comedies inspired by pop culture, with original scripts, songs and music. StarKid distributes their musicals for free on [[YouTube]], with recent projects being funded by [[Kickstarter]] and physical ticket sales.

Since the success of ''A Very Potter Musical'', the group has produced eleven stage musicals (including two Potter sequels), two [[concert tour|national tours]], two reunion concert specials, three [[sketch comedy]] shows, and three web series.

As of 2020, the company has charted 12 albums on the Billboard charts. The cast recording of ''[[Me and My Dick]]'' debuted at number 11 on the US [[Billboard charts|Cast Albums]] chart in 2010, becoming the first student-produced musical recording to chart on ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]''. The following year they landed at number one on the same chart with the cast recording of ''[[Starship (album)|Starship]]'', a feat that has since been repeated with their 2019 musical ''[[Black Friday (musical)|Black Friday]]''.

== History ==
StarKid Productions is composed of actors, writers, directors, composers, choreographers, and designers, most of them originating from the [[University of Michigan]]'s School of Music, Theater and Dance. The members met while collaborating on plays through Basement Arts, the university's student-run theater organization.

In April 2009, the students staged a musical parody of the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series entitled ''[[A Very Potter Musical]]''. The video of the play went [[viral video|viral]] on the Internet, garnering StarKid a worldwide fanbase. Inspired by the viral nature of the video, StarKid Productions was formed, named after a quote from ''[[A Very Potter Musical]]''. Later, two sequels were performed and released on YouTube, ''[[A Very Potter Sequel]]'' in 2010 and ''[[A Very Potter Senior Year]]'' in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teamstarkid.com/|title=Team StarKid|publisher=StarKid Productions|access-date=July 21, 2019}}</ref><ref name="ChicTribune">{{cite news|last=Borrelli|first=Christopher|title=What exactly is Team StarKid?|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-ent-1102-focus-starkid-group-20111101,0,6956013,full.story|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=Bruce Dold|access-date=December 18, 2011|date=November 1, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929025441/http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-ent-1102-focus-starkid-group-20111101,0,6956013,full.story|archive-date=September 29, 2013}}</ref>

The Team StarKid YouTube channel was established on June 19, 2009.<ref name="youtube.com">https://www.youtube.com/user/StarKidPotter/about</ref> The channel currently has over 730,000 subscribers and over 310,000,000 combined views.<ref name="youtube.com"/> Aside from the viral ''[[Harry Potter]]'' adaptions, Team StarKid have produced a number of other musical theatre parody shows, creating both original stories and pop culture-based parodies of [[Disney]], [[DC Comics]], [[Star Wars]]'', ''and [[The Oregon Trail (series)|The Oregon Trail]]''.

Team Starkid has had two major moves since its founding in 2009. The first was to Chicago after the founders graduated from [[The University of Michigan]]. Several shows were performed in Chicago before most of the company's members moved once again, this time to Los Angeles.

Starkid has most recently gained attention for their Hatchetfield series of musicals and short films. The series began in 2018 with the musical, ''[[The Guy Who Didn't Like Musicals]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Guy Who Didn't Like Musicals|url=https://www.teamstarkid.com/the-guy-who-didnt-like-musicals|access-date=2020-09-24|website=StarKid Productions|language=en-US}}</ref> and continued in 2019 with the premiere of [[Black Friday (musical) |''Black Friday'']].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Black Friday|url=https://www.teamstarkid.com/black-friday|access-date=2020-09-24|website=StarKid Productions|language=en-US}}</ref> Future installments of the series have been announced, including “Workin’ Boys”, a short film spin-off of ''The Guy Who Didn’t Like Musicals'', and a new musical titled ''Nerdy Prudes Must Die''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=https://twitter.com/nicklangtweets/status/1234249688653561857|url=https://twitter.com/nicklangtweets/status/1234249688653561857|access-date=2020-09-24|website=Twitter|language=en}}</ref>

==Members==
There have been many actors involved with StarKid projects over the years, and it's usual for actors to feature in a few of their productions as opposed to just one.

Among the cast members who have appeared in more than half of their projects, and can therefore be considered regular collaborators, are Jaime Lyn Beatty, Jeff Blim, Denise Donovan, Brian Holden, Lauren Lopez, Jim Povolo, Joey Richter, Dylan Saunders, Meredith Stepien, Corey Dorris, and Joseph Walker.

Several members of Team StarKid have gone on to notable careers in television or theatre.  This includes [[Emmy Award]] winner [[Darren Criss]] ([[Glee (TV series)|''Glee'']] and [[The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story|''The Assassination of Gianni Versace'']]), [[A. J. Holmes]] ([[The Book of Mormon (musical)|''The Book of Mormon'']]), [[Carlos Valdes (actor)|Carlos Valdes]] ([[The Flash (2014 TV series)|''The Flash'']]) and Britney Coleman ([[Tootsie (musical)]], [[Company (musical)]],[[Sunset Boulevard (musical)]] and [[Beautiful: The Carole King Musical]]).

Team StarKid produced a sequel to their 2011 musical ''Starship'' called ''Starship: Requiem'' that was performed on August 2, 2014 at LeakyCon in Orlando, FL. However, it was a one-time "theatrical reading" and, as such, Team StarKid does not include it in their musical canon.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=LeakyCon|author=LeakyCon|number=450731685592989696|date=March 31, 2014|title=ANNOUNCING! @TeamStarKid will perform at theatrical reading of "STARSHIP: REQUIEM" http://www.leakycon.com/?p=8224}}</ref> The story followed the adventures of the android Mega-Girl and her half-witted Starship Ranger husband, Tootsie Noodles, as the newlyweds go to visit Mega-Girl's human-hating family.<ref name="StarshipLeakyCon">{{cite web|url=http://www.leakycon.com/starship-requiem-to-be-performed-at-leakycon/|title="Starship: Requiem" to be Performed at LeakyCon 2014|author=Jordan|work=[[Mischief Management#LeakyCon|LeakyCon]]|publisher=[[Tumblr]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407073630/http://www.leakycon.com/starship-requiem-to-be-performed-at-leakycon/|archive-date=April 7, 2014|access-date=March 31, 2014}}</ref>

An audio recording of ''Starship: Requiem'' was created as a perk for those who helped fund the musical ''Firebringer'', featuring music by the band Jim and the Povolos, which included numerous members of Team Starkid. A production of ''A Very Potter Christmas'' was also included,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/TeamStarKid/status/813018086257332224|title=Happy Christmas, Everyone!

However, Eric Kahn Gale, one of the writers for the show, stated that he would write and publish a synopsis of season 2, which was released on September 3, 2013 on his [[Tumblr]] page.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gale|first=Eric Kahn|title=Little White Lie Season 2 Synopsis|url=http://erickahngalepresents.tumblr.com/post/60223046875/little-white-lie-season-2-synopsis|publisher=[[Tumblr]]|date=September 3, 2013|access-date=September 4, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930010802/http://erickahngalepresents.tumblr.com/post/60223046875/little-white-lie-season-2-synopsis|archive-date=September 30, 2013}}</ref>

===''Movies, Musicals, and Me''===
In October 2017, StarKid debuted its second web series on YouTube, ''Movies, Musicals, and Me''. The series takes place in an alternate world where every popular movie ever has been adapted into a Broadway musical. The best of these musicals all star the same man, Halpert Evans, a vain and pompous, though brilliant, actor. The series is structured as a mocumentary of Evans, chronicling the most significant musical roles of his career, along with commentary from various colleagues in Halpert's line of work. The series introduces StarKid newcomers Esther Fallick as Halpert Evans and Mary Kate Wiles as Judy Davendale. Joey Richter, Nick Lang, Brian Holden, Dylan Saunders, Lauren Lopez, Jaime Lyn Beatty, Corey Dorris, and Clark Baxtresser also star.
