==Early life==
Giacchino was born in [[Riverside Township, New Jersey]]. His father's ancestors were Italians, coming from [[Sicily]], and his mother's ancestors emigrated from [[Abruzzo]] in the center of [[Italy]].  His brother [[Anthony Giacchino]] is a documentary filmmaker and holds dual American and Italian citizenship,<ref name="Ansa">[http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/english/2010/03/08/visualizza_new.html_1731171433.html "Oscar winners thank Italy – News in English"].

Accessed February 3, 2013. "Giacchino, a graduate of Holy Cross High School (Class of '86), was scoring video games when Abrams gave him his first big break writing the music for TV's ''Alias'' and ''Lost.''"</ref>

Giacchino began combining images and music at age 10, when he began creating [[stop-motion animation]] with homemade soundtracks in his basement. While in high school, an art teacher who mentored Giacchino recommended to his parents that he attend the [[School of Visual Arts]] in [[New York City]]. Giacchino describes visiting the school with his parents thus:<ref name="VAJ">Lincourt, Carrie. "Q + A". ''Visual Arts Journal''. Volume 19, Number 1. Spring 2011. [[School of Visual Arts]]. Pages 46–49.</ref>

<blockquote>I thought, wow, this is fantastic. They actually have colleges like this? Where I can do the things that I am really interested in doing? That was amazing to me. I loved SVA. I loved the kind of freedom that it provided. It was kind of like this great experiment—okay, you're here because you like something. So let's see how much you like it. We're not going to regulate you too much. We're going to see how passionate and driven you are, and how much you want this thing.<ref name="VAJ" /></blockquote>

Giacchino enrolled at SVA, majoring in film production and minoring in history. During his final year at SVA, his instructor in film publicity announced an unpaid internship was available at [[Universal Pictures]]. Giacchino, who was the only one interested, obtained the six-month position, which he filled at night while attending school during the day and working at [[Macy's]] to pay his rent. He graduated from SVA in 1990 with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]], after which he took music classes at the [[Juilliard School]], and then at UCLA.<ref name="VAJ" /><ref name="NewYorkTimes">Burlingame, Jon (May 7, 2006).

==Career==

===Video games===
When Giacchino's internship ended, Universal hired him, giving him a job upon graduation from college. He later moved to Disney, and when Disney relocated to Los Angeles, Giacchino moved with them, working in publicity, while taking night classes in instrumentation and orchestration at [[UCLA]]. His work for Disney had him interacting with the various personnel who worked in films, such as the producers who hired composers, so when a job at [[Disney Interactive Studios|Disney Interactive]] opened for a producer, Giacchino obtained the job, thinking he could hire himself to write music for the games he produced.<ref name="VAJ" /><ref name="NewYorkTimes" /><ref name="Mackie.com" />

Giacchino's composition work for Disney Interactive during the 16-bit era included the [[Sega Genesis]] game ''[[Gargoyles (video game)|Gargoyles]]'', the SNES game ''[[Donald in Maui Mallard|Maui Mallard in Cold Shadow]]'' and the various console versions of ''[[The Lion King (video game)|The Lion King]]''.<ref name="MobyGames">[http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,47852/ "Michael Giacchino"]. MobyGames.

Giacchino has since continued his relationship with DreamWorks which also included composing the score for the ''[[Small Soldiers]]'' [[Small Soldiers (video game)|video game]] in 1998, providing full orchestral scores for many of their popular videogames. He also worked with Pandemic studios to create the theme for ''[[Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction]]''. Giacchino's award-winning compositions covers the first four installments of the ''[[Medal of Honor (computer game)|Medal of Honor]]'' series, (''[[Medal of Honor (1999 video game)|Medal of Honor]]'', ''[[Medal of Honor: Underground|Underground]]'',  ''[[Medal of Honor: Allied Assault|Allied Assault]]'' and ''[[Medal of Honor: Frontline|Frontline]]''), ''[[Medal of Honor: Heroes 2|Heroes: 2]]'', and also the scores for several other World War II-related video games like ''[[Secret Weapons Over Normandy]]'', ''[[Call of Duty]]'' and ''[[Call of Duty: Finest Hour]]''.<ref name="MichaelGiacchino">{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelgiacchino.com/works.html|title=Michael Giacchino.com – Works|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080330044225/http://www.michaelgiacchino.com/works.html|archive-date=March 30, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Additionally, Giacchino composed themes for ''[[The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer]]'', and co-wrote the theme of ''[[Black (video game)|Black]]'' with composer [[Chris Tilton]].<ref name="ChrisTilton.com">[http://www.christilton.com/black.htm Chris Tilton.com – Black] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830210811/http://www.christilton.com/black.htm |date=August 30, 2006 }}</ref> He also composed the score for ''[[Alias (video game)|Alias]]'', which was based on the television series of the same name.

===Film and television===
Giacchino's work on various video games led to his entrance into television.

In 2001, [[J. J. Abrams]], producer of the television series ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'', discovered Giacchino through his video game work and asked him to provide the new show's soundtrack. The soundtrack featured a mix of full orchestral pieces frequently intermingled with upbeat [[electronic music]], a departure from much of his previous work. Giacchino would go on to provide the score for J. J. Abrams's 2004 television series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'',<ref name="Amazon.com">[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EHSVDM Lost Soundtrack]. Amazon. Retrieved on August 21, 2011.</ref> creating an acclaimed score which employed a unique process of using spare pieces of a [[fuselage|plane fuselage]] for percussion parts. The score for ''Lost'' is also notable for a signature thematic motif: a brass fall-off at the end of certain themes.<ref name="TheLogBook">[http://www.thelogbook.com/music/lost-music-by-michael-giacchino/ The Log Book – Lost] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303080708/http://www.thelogbook.com/music/lost-music-by-michael-giacchino/ |date=March 3, 2007 }}</ref> Just like his counterpart [[Stu Phillips (composer)|Stu Phillips]], he worked with the television show creator Abrams on his shows with his music scores while Abrams supplied the show's main themes on certain series such as ''Alias''.

In 2004, Giacchino received his first big feature film commission. [[Brad Bird]], director of [[Pixar]]'s ''[[The Incredibles]]'', asked Giacchino to provide the soundtrack for the film after having heard his work on ''Alias''.<ref name="Cinemusic.net">{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemusic.net/reviews/2004/incredibles.html|title=Maintenance |work=Cinemusic}}</ref> The upbeat [[jazz]] orchestral sound was a departure in style not only for Giacchino but for Pixar, which had previously relied on [[Randy Newman|Randy]] and [[Thomas Newman]] for all of its films. Director Brad Bird had originally sought out [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] – perhaps best known for his work on the early [[James Bond]] films—but Barry was reportedly unwilling to repeat the styles of his earlier works.<ref>[http://www.moviemusic.com/mb/Forum1/HTML/013243.html Message Boards: The Incredibles!]. Moviemusic.com. Retrieved on August 21, 2011.</ref>

Giacchino was nominated for two [[Grammy Awards]] in 2005 for ''The Incredibles'': [[Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media|Best Score Soundtrack Album for Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition|Best Instrumental Composition]].<ref name="Mlscmusic.com">[http://www.mlscmusic.com/Charts%20Awards/48%20grammy/48Grammy%20Nom%20List.pdf Grammy Nominations 2005 – PDF] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929174801/http://www.mlscmusic.com/Charts%20Awards/48%20grammy/48Grammy%20Nom%20List.pdf |date=September 29, 2007 }}</ref>

Like his other counterparts [[Joel McNeely]], [[J. A. C. Redford]] and [[Frank DeVol]], Giacchino mostly associated with Disney from early in his career up to most recently, ranging from video games such as ''[[Mickey Mania]]'' and ''[[Gargoyles (video game)|Gargoyles]]'' to films such as ''The Incredibles'' and eventually collaborated with [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] in creating two new soundtracks for the updated versions of [[Space Mountain (Disneyland)|Space Mountain]] at [[Disneyland]], [[Space Mountain: Mission 2]] at [[Disneyland Paris]], and [[Space Mountain (Hong Kong Disneyland)|Space Mountain]] at [[Hong Kong Disneyland]].<ref name="Allearsnet.com">[http://www.allearsnet.com/dlr/tp/dl/space.htm Space Mountain]. Allearsnet.com (May 27, 1977). Retrieved on August 21, 2011.</ref>

Giacchino also composed scores for the 2005 films ''[[Sky High (2005 film)|Sky High]]'' and ''[[The Family Stone]]'', and the television movie ''[[The Muppets' Wizard of Oz]]''. Additionally, he wrote the music for [[Joseph Barbera]]'s final theatrical [[Tom and Jerry]] cartoon ''[[The Karate Guard]]'', and scored the Abrams-directed 2006 film ''[[Mission: Impossible III]]''.<ref name="CDUniverse.com">[http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/7068767/a/Mission+Impossible+III.htm M:I – Iii]. CDUniverse (May 9, 2006). Retrieved on August 21, 2011.</ref> Giacchino's next musical achievement was his Paris-inspired score for the Disney-Pixar film ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'', which includes the theme song "Le Festin", performed by French artist [[Camille (French singer)|Camille]]. He received his first [[Academy Award]] [[80th Academy Awards|nomination]] for this score. He also created the score for Abrams' 2009 ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' film.

Giacchino [[Up (film score)|scored]] the [[Pixar]] film ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' (and its accompanying animated short ''[[Partly Cloudy]]''), for which he collaborated with director [[Pete Docter]]. This marked the first time Giacchino worked with a Pixar director other than Brad Bird. This work gained Giacchino his first [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]: the first-ever win for Pixar in that category. Giacchino notes that he won on the same night as his SVA classmate Joel Harlow won for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup|Best Makeup Oscar]] for ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]''.<ref name="VAJ" />

Giacchino has continued his collaboration with J. J. Abrams. For the Abrams-produced monster film ''[[Cloverfield]]'', Giacchino wrote an homage to Japanese monster scores in an overture titled "ROAR!", which played over the credits, and constituted the only original music for the film. He composed the score for J. J. Abrams' feature ''Super 8'' in 2011. He also composed for the pilot of the Abrams-produced American television series ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'', after which Giacchino gave scoring duties to his assistant [[Chad Seiter]], who scored the first half of [[Fringe (season 1)|season one]]. The task was then passed on to [[Chris Tilton]], who scored the latter half of season one and all subsequent seasons.

In 2016, Giacchino composed the score for the Marvel film ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]],'' as well as the score for the Disney film ''[[Zootopia]]''. Giacchino also composed the fanfare for the new [[Marvel Studios]] logo, which debuted with ''Doctor Strange''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/marvel-studios-new-logo-fanfare-michael-giacchino/ |title=Watch: Marvel Studios Debuts New Logo with Fanfare by Michael Giacchino |last=Goldberg |first=Matt |website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |date=July 24, 2016 |access-date=July 30, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725145310/http://collider.com/marvel-studios-new-logo-fanfare-michael-giacchino/ |archive-date=July 25, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> In September 2016, it was announced that Giacchino had been chosen to replace composer [[Alexandre Desplat]] as the composer for the ''[[Star Wars]]'' anthology film ''[[Rogue One]]'' after Desplat was unavailable following reshoots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-wars-rogue-one-replaces-929387|title='Star Wars: Rogue One' Replaces Its Composer (Exclusive)|date=September 15, 2016}}</ref> Giacchino then scored two more Marvel films, 2017's ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' and its sequel, 2019's ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/spider-man-homecoming-be-scored-by-michael-giacchino-944508|title='Spider-Man: Homecoming' to Be Scored by Michael Giacchino|work=hollywoodreporter.com|date=November 6, 2016|access-date=November 7, 2016}}</ref>

Giacchino returned to Pixar to score ''[[Coco (2017 film)|Coco]]'' (2017) and ''[[Incredibles 2]]'' (2018).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/2015/10/29/incredibles-2-brad-bird-confirms-michael-giacchnio-back-as-compo/|title=Incredibles 2: Brad Bird Confirms Michael Giacchino Back As Composer|work=ComicBook.com|date=October 29, 2015}}</ref>
He also composed the score for Taika Waititi's ''[[Jojo Rabbit]]''. In 2022, Giacchino will re-team with Matt Reeves to score'' [[The Batman (film)|The Batman]]''.

In 2018, Giacchino wrote, directed and scored [[imdbtitle:8961056|Monster Challenge]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Monster Challenge Archives » Michael Giacchino|url=https://michaelgiacchino.com/tag/monster-challenge/|website=Michael Giacchino|language=en-US|access-date=2020-06-01}}</ref> The short film is a satirical take on Japanese game shows, starring [[Patton Oswalt]], [[Ben Schwartz]], [[Dermot Mulroney]], [[Amy Brenneman]], [[imdbname:2473598|Taishi Mizuno]], [[imdbname:1641303|Ann Madox]], and [[imdbname:2954839|Teruko Nakajima]].

Michael Giacchino's music can also be heard in "[[Star Tours: The Adventure Continues]]" during the "travel log videos" shown in the queue for both the Disneyland and Walt Disney World versions of the attraction.

In 2009, he was asked to conduct the Academy Awards orchestra for the [[81st Academy Awards]]. For this project he rearranged many famous movie themes in different styles, including a 1930s Big Band treatment of ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' and a bossa nova of ''[[Moon River]]''. Giacchino also composed the fanfare for the 100th Anniversary logo of [[Paramount Pictures]], which debuted with ''[[Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol]]'' on December 7, 2011 at the [[Dubai International Film Festival]], which it carried onto the logos of [[Paramount Players]], which debuted alongside the logo with ''[[Nobody's Fool (2018 film)|Nobody's Fool]]'' on November 2, 2018, [[Paramount Animation]], which debuted alongside the logo with ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run]]'' on August 14, 2020 in Canada and [[Paramount Television Studios]], which debuted with an episode of ''[[Minority Report (TV series)|Minority Report]]'' and was also used on the [[Paramount Network]] Original Productions logo with ''[[68 Whiskey]]'', as well as the new fanfare for [[Marvel Studios]], which debuted alongside its logo with ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'' on October 13, 2016 in Hong Kong, in which he also composed the [[Spider-Man (theme song)|theme song of the 1967 ''Spider-Man'' cartoon series]], in ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'', replacing his work on the fanfare of the Marvel Studios logo for that film.
