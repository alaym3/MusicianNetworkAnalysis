'''Karin Elisabeth Dreijer''' (born 7 April 1975) is a Swedish singer-songwriter and record producer. Dreijer was one half of the [[electronic music]] duo [[the Knife]], formed with their brother [[Olof Dreijer]]. Dreijer released their [[Fever Ray (album)|debut solo album]] under the alias '''Fever Ray''' in January 2009. Their second studio album, ''[[Plunge (album)|Plunge]]'', under the same alias, was released in October 2017.

Dreijer's vocal style is notable for both shrill and deep tones, and also the use of multitracked vocals, with different uses of pitch-shifting technology on each track, creating an intricate and mysterious effect. Visually, they employ the use of masks, face and body paint, intricate costumes, and other theatrical elements in photo shoots, videos and live performances, during which they often perform behind a gauze screen that partially obscures the audience's view.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hogan |first=Marc |url=https://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/7631-fever-ray/ |title=Interviews: Fever Ray |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=30 March 2009 |access-date=6 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408154532/http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/7631-fever-ray/ |archive-date=8 April 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The duo performed live for the first time in 2006, when they went on the [[Silent Shout Tour]] in support of their third album [[Silent Shout|of the same name]] (2006). In 2009, the duo were commissioned alongside [[Mount Sims|Mt. Sims]] and [[Planningtorock]] by the Danish performance group Hotel Pro Forma to compose an opera, titled ''[[Tomorrow, in a Year]]'', which is based on [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theknife.net/tommorow-in-a-year-information.html |title=The Knife in Collaboration with Mt.

The duo disbanded in November 2014, after completing the [[Shaking the Habitual Tour]].

===Solo work===
While The Knife were on hiatus, Dreijer released, under the alias Fever Ray, their [[Fever Ray (album)|self-titled solo debut album]]. It was released digitally on 12 January 2009 and physically on 18 March 2009 through [[Rabid Records]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.feverray.com/?p=82 |title=Fever Ray album out – 18/23 March |publisher=FeverRay.com |date=13 January 2009 |access-date=20 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222085844/http://www.feverray.com/?p=82 |archive-date=22 December 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The album was preceded by its lead single "[[If I Had a Heart]]" (2008), which was used in numerous television series, including ''[[Person of Interest (TV series)|Person of Interest]]'', ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' and ''[[Wentworth (TV series)|Wentworth]]'', as well as the opening theme song for the Canadian-Irish historical drama television series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]''.

In September 2009, Dreijer composed the soundtrack to ''[[Dirty Diaries]]'', a collection of feminist pornographic short films. In a review of the collection, Swedish newspaper ''[[Smålandsposten]]'' described the soundtrack as appropriate for the film, though repetitive.<ref>{{cite web |last=Carnmo |first=Camilla |url=http://www.smp.se/noje_o_kultur/film/dirty-diaries(1504761).gm |title=Dirty Diaries |language=sv |work=[[Smålandsposten]] |date=4 September 2009 |access-date=23 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217100810/http://smp.se/noje_o_kultur/film/dirty-diaries(1504761).gm |archive-date=17 December 2009}}</ref>

Contrary to a statement from the film's director, Dreijer did not make a cameo appearance in the 2011 film ''[[Red Riding Hood (2011 film)|Red Riding Hood]]''. However, the soundtrack features a new track performed by Dreijer as Fever Ray, "The Wolf", as well as "Keep the Streets Empty for Me" from their debut album.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://feverray.com/2010/11/18/new-fever-ray-music-to-feature-in-upcoming-film-red-riding-hood/ |title=New Fever Ray music to feature in upcoming film, Red Riding Hood |publisher=FeverRay.com |date=18 November 2010 |access-date=1 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123195634/http://feverray.com/2010/11/18/new-fever-ray-music-to-feature-in-upcoming-film-red-riding-hood/ |archive-date=23 November 2010}}</ref> "The Wolf" was also featured in [[Ubisoft]]'s ''[[Far Cry Primal]]'' announcement trailer, as well as during the game's final mission.

Dreijer wrote the music for the theatrical adaptation of [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s 1968 horror film ''[[Hour of the Wolf]]'', which premiered at Stockholm's [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]] on 12 March 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://feverray.com/2010/11/01/vargtimmen-the-wolf-hour-premiere/ |title='Vargtimmen, The Wolf Hour' premiere |publisher=FeverRay.com |date=1 November 2010 |access-date=25 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315181348/http://feverray.com/2010/11/01/vargtimmen-the-wolf-hour-premiere/ |archive-date=15 March 2011}}</ref> One of these tracks, "No Face", appeared in demo form on the 2012 compilation album ''We Are the Works in Progress'', organised by [[Blonde Redhead]] to benefit victims of the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|2011 Japanese tsunami]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Stosuy |first=Brandon |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/44961-hear-new-music-from-fever-rays-karin-dreijer-andersson/ |title=Hear New Music From Fever Ray's Karin Dreijer |work=Pitchfork |date=29 December 2011 |access-date=13 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111192947/http://pitchfork.com/news/44961-hear-new-music-from-fever-rays-karin-dreijer-andersson/ |archive-date=11 January 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Collaborations===
In 2005, Dreijer supplied vocals on the track "[[What Else Is There?]]" by [[Röyksopp]] on the album ''[[The Understanding (Röyksopp album)|The Understanding]]''. The song charted highly, raising Karin's profile at an early stage of their career. They also appeared in the video for that single, but not as the vocalist, who was portrayed by the Norwegian model [[Marianne Schröder]]. In 2008, Dreijer provided vocals for the [[Deus (band)|Deus]] song "Slow" from the band's ''[[Vantage Point (album)|Vantage Point]]'' album. Dreijer was featured on the tracks "This Must Be It" and "Tricky Tricky" again by [[Röyksopp]], appearing on their 2009 album ''[[Junior (Röyksopp album)|Junior]]''. On 6 September 2019, a collaborative EP between [[Björk]], Dreijer (credited as Fever Ray), and the Knife titled ''[[Country Creatures]]'' was released. It contains remixes of Björk's song "Feature Creatures" by Dreijer and by the Knife as well as a remix of Dreijer's "This Country" by Björk.

==Personal life==
Dreijer largely keeps their private life outside the headlines, but in 2017, they told ''[[The Guardian]]'' in an interview that they were previously married and had dropped Andersson from their name following a divorce. In the same interview, they described themself as "definitely a queer person, but [...] very gender-fluid."<ref name="guardian2017">{{cite web |last=Cragg |first=Michael |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/18/fever-ray-pleasure-patriarchy-political-revolution-plunge-karin-dreijer |title=Fever Ray: on pleasure, patriarchy and political revolution |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=18 November 2017 |access-date=21 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171120130943/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/18/fever-ray-pleasure-patriarchy-political-revolution-plunge-karin-dreijer |archive-date=20 November 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Dreijer uses [[Singular they|they/them]] pronouns.<ref name=pronoun>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/09/04/642253284/karin-dreijer-is-the-21st-centurys-sonic-shapeshifter |title=Karin Dreijer Is The 21st Century's Sonic Shapeshifter |work=[[NPR]] |date=26 November 2019 |access-date=29 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221142636/https://www.npr.org/2018/09/04/642253284/karin-dreijer-is-the-21st-centurys-sonic-shapeshifter |archive-date=21 December 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> They have two daughters.<ref name="guardian2017"/>
