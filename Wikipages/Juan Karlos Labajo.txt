After the season of The Voice Kids Philippines Labajo, along with his other three co-finalists in The Voice Kids, officially became a part of [[Star Magic]], ABS-CBN's training and management center.<ref name="StarMagic">[http://entertainment.abs-cbn.com/tv/shows/starmagic/show-updates/2014/08/19/the-voice-kids-top-4-joins-star-magic "The Voice Kids Top 4 Joins Star Magic"]. ''ABS-CBN''. Retrieved August 20, 2014.</ref>

Labajo's first project as part of Star Magic was in ABS-CBN's [[family drama]] series ''[[Hawak Kamay (TV series)|Hawak-Kamay]]''. A preview on August 15, 2014, showed him with the show's cast.<ref>[http://philnews.ph/2014/08/16/juan-karlos-labajo-to-join-hawak-kamay-casts/ "Juan Karlos Labajo To Join ''Hawak Kamay'' Casts"].

===2015: ''Ipaglaban Mo'', ''Pangako Sa 'Yo'', Debut Album===

To continue Labajo's acting career he played as Nico in ABS-CBN's TV Series ''[[Ipaglaban Mo!|Ipaglaban Mo: Sa Dulo ng Daan]]'' episode last May 9, 2015. Labajo was also cast in "''[[Pangako Sa ’Yo (2015 TV series)|Pangako Sa 'Yo]]''" and plays the role of "Amboy Mobido", one of Yna's friends and is the brother of "Egoy"/Jonathan Mobido (Grae Fernandez ) At auditions for a church play "Josephine the Dreamer" Amboy is filled with awe as he sees the beautiful Lia Buenavista daughter of Governor Buenavista known to Amboy as "Lia B". At the auditions when it is time for Lia to tryout Amboy love struck as usual interrupts constantly to tell the judges to give the part. Although Amboy thinks Lia sings beautifully but she does not get the part. Later on Lia tries again for a second time and both Amboy and Egoy are there. As they watch the auditions Egoy innocently falls in love but tries to resist knowing how much his brother loves her. Egoy and Amboy's contributions to the storyline of the show will start to intertwine as the series continues.

In August 2015, Labajo released his debut album, "JK". It has a total of 8 songs, including a special band version of "Para Sa 'Yo," and an acoustic version of "This Gravity". "Di Ka Man Lang Nagpaalam" is a special song on the album, because JK dedicates it to his late mother.<ref>http://myxph.com/features/24840/myxclusive-jk-labajo-unveils-debut-album/</ref>

In October, he was the MYX Celebrity VJ for the month of October, which was his first time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://myxph.com/features/25232/watch-juan-karlos-labajo-is-our-myx-celebrity-vj-for-october/|title=WATCH: JUAN KARLOS LABAJO Is Our MYX Celebrity VJ For October!|work=myxph.com|date=October 2, 2017|access-date=November 27, 2018}}</ref>

===2016: We Love OPM: The Celebrity Sing-Offs, Pinoy Big Brother: Lucky 7===

In May 2016, Labajo was one of the contestants in the Filipino reality music competition show [[We Love OPM]] The Celebrity Sing-Offs on [[ABS-CBN]] which was aired from May 14, 2016 to July 17, 2016. His other co-teammates were The Voice Kids Season 2 Finalist Kyle Echarri and PBB 737 Teens' Finalist [[Bailey May]]. Their CelebriTeam's name was supposedly "Poon and Fork", Labajo jokingly suggested to their mentor [[Richard Poon]], but Poon declined Labajo's witty suggestion. And so, the three decided that their CelebriTeam's name would be Voice Next Door.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment2.abs-cbn.com/tv/shows/iloveopm/videos/2016/05/14/9551416-we-love-opm-meet-team-voice-next-door|title=We Love OPM: Meet Team Voice Next Door|work=etertainment2.abs-cbn.com.com|date=May 14, 2016|access-date=January 15, 2017}}</ref> They performed the songs Sa Kanya popularized by [[Martin Nievera]], Pangarap na Bituin by [[Sharon Cuneta]], Lalake by [[Hagibis]], Paano by [[Gary Valenciano]], Kung Tayo'y Magkakalayo by [[Rey Valera]] with the [[Yeng Constantino|Oh My Girls]] CelebriTeam which consists of [[Alexa Ilacad]], [[Ylona Garcia]], and Krissha Viaje, Macho Gwapito by [[Rico J. Puno]], Sayang na Sayang by [[Aegis]], Wag Kang Pabebe by [[Vice Ganda]], and Blue Jeans by [[APO Hiking Society]].

Labajo wasn't present in some episodes due to fever or for having another schedule during the taping of those episodes. From week nine of the show until the semi-finals, Labajo was permanently absent due to his competition in [[Pinoy Big Brother: Lucky 7]] in Vietnam and in the Philippines. And so his co-teammates Kyle Echarri and [[Bailey May]] were the only ones left in the group. The Voice Next Door was eliminated in the Semi-finals of the show.

After, Labajo with Andrea Brillantes and the other Kapamilya Teen Stars' production in ASAP last July 3, 2016, [[Robi Domingo]] and [[Toni Gonzaga]] announced that he will be joining the new [[Pinoy Big Brother: Lucky 7]]. Labajo shared some of his expectations and said that he is excited to be part of the reality show. On "Day 0", he, [[Yassi Pressman]], [[Jinri Park]], [[Mccoy De Leon]], and [[Nikko Natividad]] were introduced as the first five celebrity housemates. They were flown from [[Manila]] to [[Vietnam]] becoming the show's first time out of the country experience. Although, Jinri, JK, and Hideo were the only ones left due to their visa and immigration conflict.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://entertainment.abs-cbn.com/tv/updates/8270716-pbb-housemates-na-sina-jk-jinri-at-hideo-naharang-sa-immigration-dahil-sa-kulang-sa-papeles|title=PBB Housemates na sina JK, Jinri at Hideo, naharang sa immigration dahil sa kulang sa papeles|work=entertainment.abs-cbn.com|date=July 6, 2016|access-date=January 15, 2017}}</ref>

On "Day 2", the three were finally able to arrive in [[Vietnam]] after the immigration and visa issue. In that morning, they were chained and blindfolded inside the living room in the Big Brother Vietnam House, making the housemates to unchain them within 30 minutes. Luckily, they were successful with their task.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://entertainment.abs-cbn.com/tv/shows/pbbseason7/videos/2016/07/12/15371216-pbb7-day-2-lucky-celeb-housemates-nagulat-sa-pagdating-ng-bagong-tatlong-housemates | title=PBB7 Day 2: Lucky Celeb Housemates, nagulat sa pagdating ng bagong tatlong housemates | work=[[ABS-CBN Corporation]]| publisher=Pinoy Big Brother  | date=July 12, 2016 | access-date=January 15, 2017}}</ref>

On "Day 19", Labajo came back to the PBB House, since the girl housemates were able to guess him while they were blindfolded.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://entertainment.abs-cbn.com/tv/shows/pbbseason7/show-updates/2016/08/01/11780116-pinoy-big-brother-season-7-day-19-episode-highlights | title=Pinoy Big Brother Season 7 Day 19: Episode Highlights | work=[[ABS-CBN Corporation]]| publisher=Pinoy Big Brother  | date=August 2, 2016 | access-date=August 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/08/01/16/pbb-with-one-touch-elisse-recognizes-jeromes-hands | title='PBB': With one touch, Elisse recognizes Jerome's hands | work=news.abs-cbn.com| publisher=[[ABS-CBN News]] |date=August 2, 2016 | access-date=January 15, 2017}}</ref>

During their 2nd Lucky Task which was to come up with a water puppet show, Labajo suggested something but Nonong and Chacha didn't approve to his suggestion, making him feel ignored. Labajo later on went to the confession room to have some advice from Kuya. He cried for a little inside the confession room because he felt like he didn't have any worth since he was the youngest among the celebrity housemates. Kuya told him to be more open to his housemates since they were his second family.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/pinoybigbrother/comments/4tkcde/pbb_lucky_7_e05_jk_cries_for_control/|title=PBB Lucky 7: E05 – JK cries for control|work=reddit.com|date=July 19, 2016|access-date=January 15, 2017}}</ref> Nonong and Chacha suspected that he wasn't feeling okay, and so they asked him what was wrong. Labajo didn't say anything about it and both Nonong and Chacha gave him the offer to control the puppets, but he refused and stuck with playing the guitar for the music of their water puppet show. After their successful task, the three of them talked again until Labajo admitted that he was feeling ignored with his suggestions by them. Also, he followed Kuya's advice to be open to them.

On July 15's episode of the show, Kuya asked Labajo in the confession room about his personal life. He then shared about his past in Cebu, how hard it was for him and how he felt about it. After Kuya asking him about his mother, he teared up and told Kuya how regretful he was because he wasn't able to spend much time with his mother like how others kids do with theirs. He also shared that he was present during his mother's death. Kuya told him that his mother is very proud of him, regardless of wherever she is. Kuya also told him that he has come far from where he was, and that he will experience more as he grows older so that he should live his life as a child since he still is.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/07/15/16/pbb-why-jk-labajo-cried-about-mom|title='PBB': Why JK Labajo cried about mom|work=news.abs-cbn.com|date=July 16, 2016|access-date=January 15, 2017}}</ref>

During the celebrity housemates' Big Jump Challenge, Labajo's helper for that challenge was his younger half-brother Louie Stephan Labajo, who made him shock when he first saw him after many months. After the Big Jump Challenge, Labajo was in the confession room. Kuya asked how his relationship with his brother was, and he told him that it was a neighborly type. He admitted that he was jealous of his mother's second family since his mother spent more of her time with her family rather than with him. He also mentioned that he and his two younger half-brothers weren't close, making him say that he always wanted a sibling. Although mentioned earlier, he wasn't close with them. He cried but Kuya told him that he's still young and he has the ability to spend his time with his brothers because dreams can be reached.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.abs-cbn.com/tv/shows/pbbseason7/videos/2016/08/03/10580316-pbb-day-21-jk-naluha-nang-makita-ang-kanyang-kapatid-sa-game-of-throws-task|title=PBB Day 21: JK, naluha nang makita ang kanyang kapatid sa Game of Throws task|work=entertainment.abs-cbn.com|date=August 4, 2016|access-date=January 15, 2017}}</ref>

He was asked by Kuya to play Vivoree's own song composition, which he did.

On January 16, MCA Music announced on their social media accounts that his first ever major solo concert and birthday concert entitled, "JKL Live" was "postponed indefinitely due to unforeseen circumstances." Last February 6, 2017, Labajo's second album entitled, "JKL", was released in selected Astroplus and Astrovision stores. His album consists of 8 tracks with his 3 own compositions entitled, "Demonyo", "Forever" a wedding song, and "Move On" which he composed when he was still in [[Pinoy Big Brother|PBB]]. It also comes up with an EDM-like version.

This February 13, his first ever movie appearance was in the movie premiere of Joven Tan's indie film "Tatlong Bibe"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://thestandard.com.ph/mobile/article/227528|title= 'Tatlong Bibe' nursery rhyme turned into movie|work= thestandard.com.ph|date= January 24, 2017|access-date= February 16, 2017}}</ref> along with his former contestant in [[The Voice Kids Philippines]], [[Lyca Gairanod]], Marco Masa, [[Raikko Mateo]], and others. He is the grandson of [[Eddie Garcia]] in the movie and is paired up with [[Sharlene San Pedro]]. The film's opening nationwide was on March 1.

As Lucas Noble in A Love to Last, bashing from the viewers leads his way to improvement in acting. "The people on set, I ask them, is it okay na ganito or baka masira ako or whatever? Tapos sabi nila it's actually great kasi effective daw 'yung acting ko. Sabi nila I should be proud kasi naaapektuhan ang mga tao," he said in an interview just recently. "I am flattered kasi for me, I am not good enough so I really feel happy when people compliment me with all those really amazing stuff. Pero actually wala pa akong acting workshops so I am really planning on doing some acting workshop kasi I really feel I need it," he said.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/05/24/17/why-jk-labajo-doesnt-mind-getting-hate-tweets|title= Why JK Labajo doesn't mind getting hate tweets|work= news.abs-cbn.com|date= May 24, 2017|access-date=May 27, 2017}}</ref> JK mentioned that A Love to Last was his biggest break so far, and that he's blessed to be working with actors who are much more advanced than he is such as [[Ian Veneracion]] who plays as his father in the show, [[Iza Calzado]] who is his mother that betrayed him, and [[Bea Alonzo]] as Andrea Agoncillo, the fiancé of Anton.

Recently, he's been sharing both in interviews and social media that some of his inspirations in his career are [[Daniel Day-Lewis]], [[Joel Torre]],<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exS-szkqYYU "TWBA Online Exclusive: JK Labajo"].
