'''The Twilight Sad''' are a Scottish [[post-punk revival|post-punk]]/[[indie rock]] band, comprising James Graham (vocals), Andy MacFarlane (guitar), Johnny Docherty (bass), Brendan Smith (keyboards) and Sebastien Schultz (drums). The band are signed to [[Rock Action Records]] and have released five albums, as well as several EPs and singles. Their 2007 debut album, ''[[Fourteen Autumns & Fifteen Winters]]'', drew widespread acclaim from critics,<ref name="Metacritic FA&FW">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/twilightsad/fourteenautumnsandfifteenwinters |title=Fourteen Autumns & Fifteen Winters by The Twilight Sad |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=CNET Networks, Inc |access-date=18 May 2010}}</ref> who noted Graham's thick Scottish accent and MacFarlane's dense sonic walls of [[shoegazing]] guitar and wheezing accordion. The Twilight Sad's notoriously loud live performances have been described as "completely ear-splitting",<ref>{{cite web |first=Ian |last=Cohen |title=Pitchfork: Album Reviews: The Twilight Sad: Here, It Never Snowed.

Sessions inspired by stripped-down and reworked live performances yielded the 2008 mini-album, ''[[Here, It Never Snowed. Afterwards It Did]]''.

Their second album, ''[[Forget the Night Ahead]]'', marked a shift in the band's direction; lyrically more personal and musically darker and more streamlined,<ref>{{cite web |first=Heather |last=Phares |title=Forget the Night Ahead – The Twilight Sad |url=http://allmusic.com/album/forget-the-night-ahead-r1633968/review |access-date=8 December 2010}}</ref> it was released in 2009 to acclaim.<ref name="Metacritic FTNA">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/twilightsad/forgetthenightahead |title=Forget the Night Ahead by The Twilight Sad |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=CNET Networks, Inc |access-date=19 July 2010}}</ref> Recording sessions for the album also produced the mid-2010 release ''[[The Wrong Car]]'', which followed the departure of founding bassist Craig Orzel in February 2010. The Twilight Sad's third album, ''[[No One Can Ever Know]]'', was released in February 2012 and marked another stylistic shift, with the band citing [[industrial music]] and [[krautrock]] influences for a darker, sparser sound.<ref name="AudioPerv">{{cite web |title=The Twilight Sad Set To Release New Album 'No One Can Ever Know' On 7 February, Playing SXSW |url=http://theaudioperv.com/2011/11/14/the-twilight-sad-set-to-release-new-album-%E2%80%98no-one-will-ever-know%E2%80%99-on-february-7-playing-sxsw/ |date=14 November 2011 |access-date=23 December 2011}}</ref> The band's fourth album, entitled ''[[Nobody Wants to Be Here and Nobody Wants to Leave]]'', was released in late October 2014 to universally positive reviews,<ref name="MetaNobody">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/no-one-wants-to-be-here-and-no-one-wants-to-leave/the-twilight-sad |title=Nobody Wants to Be Here and Nobody Wants to Leave by The Twilight Sad |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=CNET Networks, Inc |access-date=13 November 2014}}</ref> and was the band's last album with founding member Mark Devine, who left amicably in January 2018. The Twilight Sad's fifth studio album, ''[[It Won/t Be Like This All the Time]]'', was released in January 2019 to further critical acclaim.

==History==

===Beginnings (2003–2006)===
The foundation for the group started in [[Kilsyth]] and the neighbouring village of [[Banton, North Lanarkshire|Banton]], when vocalist James Graham met guitarist Andy MacFarlane in high school and went on to form a cover band with some friends, which included drummer Mark Devine. After leaving school, they decided to take it more seriously. In late 2003, MacFarlane met bassist Craig Orzel in a bus stop and invited him to join the newly formed band.<ref name="SK">{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Lindsay |title=Seven years of Sad-ness, and now? |url=http://stereokill.net/2010/05/interview-craig-orzel-the-twilight-sad/ |publisher=Stereokill |date=20 May 2010 |access-date=26 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120720090350/http://stereokill.net/2010/05/interview-craig-orzel-the-twilight-sad/ |archive-date=20 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> They took their name from a line in the poem ''But I Was Looking at the Permanent Stars'' by British poet [[Wilfred Owen]], which reads "Sleep mothered them; and left ''the twilight sad''."<ref name="GoodReads">{{cite web |title=Quote by Wilfred Owen |url=http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/show/384343 |access-date=12 July 2012}}</ref><ref name="Twitter">{{cite web|date=7 July 2012|title=Twilight Sad: Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/thetwilightsad/status/221658830906474496|access-date=12 July 2012}}; James Graham confirmed this in a Twitter update: [sic] "our names from a Wilfred Owen poem but unfortunately people think we've got something to do with a teen vampire series :("</ref>

They performed two highly experimental shows at [[The 13th Note Café]] in [[Glasgow]] that revolved around 30-minute noise jams with guitars, bass, drums, theremin, tape loops from films and old folk and country songs, effects pedals, toy keyboards, thumb pianos, and computer games.<ref name="FatCat Bio">{{cite web |title=FatCat Records: The Twilight Sad |url=http://fat-cat.co.uk/fatcat/artistInfo.php?id=107 |access-date=18 January 2011}}</ref> Afterwards, they decided to take a more traditional approach, which led them to write their first song, "[[That Summer, at Home I Had Become the Invisible Boy]]".<ref name="firstsong">{{cite web |first=Chitra |last=Wamaswamy |title=Tripping the light fantastic – Scotland on Sunday |url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/features/Tripping-the-light-fantastic-.3713947.jp |date=27 January 2008 |access-date=23 March 2011}}</ref>

In September 2005, they produced a 4-song demo with a 24-track desk, trying to get the best representation as possible, and sent it over to [[Brighton]]-based [[Fat Cat Records]]. Alex Knight, co-founder of the label, went to Glasgow to watch the band perform their third gig and signed them on the spot.<ref name="Q&A">{{cite web |first=Rich |last=Hughes |title=Q&A: The Twilight Sad |url=http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/2007/05/qa-the-twilight-sad/ |date=4 May 2007}}</ref><ref name="disbandbio">{{cite web |title=The Twilight Sad // Drowned In Sound |url=http://drownedinsound.com/directory/artists/The_Twilight_Sad |access-date=23 March 2011 |archive-date=3 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203125613/http://drownedinsound.com/directory/artists/The_Twilight_Sad |url-status=dead }}</ref> The demo recordings were later issued commercially on a split cassette tape release with [[Frightened Rabbit]] for [[Record Store Day]] in 2011.<ref name="TTSFRDemos">{{cite web |title=Frightened Rabbit / Twilight Sad, The – Demos (Cassette) at Discogs |url=http://www.discogs.com/release/2852395 |access-date=4 December 2014}}</ref>

It gave us a lot of confidence we were on the right path." The band's first commercial release, [[The Twilight Sad (EP)|their self-titled EP]], was mixed by label mate [[Max Richter]] and released in November 2006 in the United States only. They then proceeded to play the fourth gig of their career at New York's [[CMJ Music Marathon]]. During this time the band also toured with [[Micah P.

Whilst on tour with [[Errors (band)|Errors]] in October 2010, vocalist James Graham stated that "the next [album] is not going to be anything like the first two.

The Twilight Sad's third album, ''[[No One Can Ever Know]]'', was released on 6 February 2012.

In an interview with ''[[NME]]'', posted on 9 July 2018, Andy MacFarlane stated that the band's fifth studio album is "finished", with a tentative release date of January 2019.<ref name="NME5" /> MacFarlane said, "It all came together really well. To me, it's like a different band almost. I did a stupid thing of writing loads of music, then giving it to James to write stuff over, then I deleted all the music. So then I wrote another album under it... I think we just needed to shake up the routine. One of our mates bought us those [[Brian Eno]] [[Oblique Strategies|Oblique Strategy cards]]. I picked one out and it was like 'delete everything, must try harder, don't tell James'. The aim was to try and do stuff that we'd enjoy playing live, to make it more interesting for ourselves as well as everyone else."<ref name="NME5"/> In the same interview, James Graham discussed the album's lyrics and themes, describing them as "heavier": "It's all pretty full on but there's some lighter shades and some hope on there. The first song that we're going to come back with epitomises the record. It's got really noisy guitars but it's pretty melodic. I think it's the next stage of who we're meant to be. ...I won't say exactly what it's dealing with [lyrically] because a lot of it might be quite obvious, but I'm not hiding behind a lot of metaphors anymore. I've done that, what's the point in trying to do it again? I'm really proud of our lyrics in the past but this is just what came out. I don't need to hide behind anything any more. It's a bit of a leap to just go 'this is actually how I'm feeling.' I think now is the time to just be more open and honest with people. For myself it was important to say these things, but when it was done it was great to share it's okay to feel that way."<ref name="NME5"/>

On 10 July 2018, the band announced that they had signed to [[Mogwai]]'s label [[Rock Action Records]] and released their new single, stylised as "I/m Not Here [missing face]", for streaming and as a digital download. The release coincided with an announcement of late 2018 tour dates in North America and Europe.<ref name="RA1">{{cite web |title=The Twilight Sad sign to Rock Action, announce new single and tour |url=http://www.rockaction.co.uk/news/2779/the_twilight_sad_sign_to_rock_action___announce_new_single_+_tour |date=10 July 2018 |access-date=10 July 2018}}</ref> On 5 September, the band announced that their fifth studio album, titled and stylised as ''[[It Won/t Be Like This All the Time]]'', would be released on 18 January 2019.

All five of us will be taking part and sharing memories from past gigs, sharing thoughts on playing live and many other things."<ref name="NME" />

==Music style and influences==
When asked to describe their debut album, Graham says the band likes to see their songs as "[[Folk music|folk]] with layers of noise", as they are based on experiences that have happened to them, around their hometowns or people they know.<ref name="noripcord"/> They often cite the works of [[Daniel Johnston]], [[Serge Gainsbourg]], [[Phil Spector]], [[Arab Strap (band)|Arab Strap]], and [[Leonard Cohen]] as influences.<ref name="FatCat Bio"/><ref name="Q&A"/> Graham lists the 2003 Arab Strap album ''[[Monday at the Hug & Pint]]'' amongst his favourite releases of the 2000s, stating that it was "the first Arab Strap album that I ever listened to... For me it was the first record that I realized it was OK to sing in your own [[Scottish English|accent]]. [[Aidan Moffat|Aidan [Moffat]]] is one of the best lyricists of the past two decades!"<ref name="RaggedWords">{{cite web |title=James Graham's (The Twilight Sad) albums of the decade |url=http://www.raggedwords.com/content/james-grahams-twilight-sad-albums-decade |publisher=Ragged Words |access-date=2 March 2012}}</ref> Graham also cites [[Arcade Fire]]'s debut album ''[[Funeral (Arcade Fire album)|Funeral]]'' as a key influence. In a 2015 feature with ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]'' magazine, he said, "It was around the time that Andy [MacFarlane] had been saying to me that he wanted me to write some songs with him, and it was also around the time that I finally knew what I wanted to write about. Without this record I don't know if I'd have approached our debut album in the way that I did. ''Funeral'' had a massive influence on my songwriting style and the way in which I approach writing songs. The way in which the storytelling within the song develops as the track progresses, the power of repeating the same line within a song and the different ways to deliver the line to give it different meanings... ''Funeral'' is an album that will stay with me for the rest of my life and will always influence the music I write."<ref name="ArcadeFire">{{cite web |first=Mike |last=Diver |title=The Top 100 Albums Of Clash's Lifetime: 4-2 |url=http://www.clashmusic.com/features/the-top-100-albums-of-clashs-lifetime-4-2 |date=1 December 2015 |access-date=10 June 2016}}</ref> Graham also mentions his liking for bands such as [[Joy Division]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://muzikalia.com/entrevistamos-the-twilight-sad/|first=Manuel|last=Pinazo|title=Entrevistamos a The Twilight Sad|publisher=muzikalia.com|date=28 October 2019|access-date=28 October 2019}}</ref> By the time of their third album, the band began exploring [[post-punk]] and [[krautrock]] facets of their influences, with MacFarlane citing artists such as [[Public Image Ltd.|PiL]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Can (band)|Can]], [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]] and [[Wire (band)|Wire]] as key inspirations.<ref name="Thefourohfive">{{cite web |first=Darren |last=Carle |url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/music/interviews/the-twilight-sad-we-never-want-to-remake-the-same-record-just-because-it-s-pleased-some-people |title=The Twilight Sad: "We never want to remake the same record just because it’s pleased some people" |publisher= Theskinny.co.uk |date=5 January 2012 |access-date=23 December 2016}}</ref>

In an October 2009 interview with ''[[The Fly (magazine)|The Fly]]'', they admitted, "We are still at the stage where we don't really know where we are in this whole music industry thing. We know people like us, but we don't really know where we fit in or, if we go to certain places, up or not. [...] It's not like we're a stadium band. We're not a lads band, like [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] or something. We're not a scenestery band, and yet we're not a pure experimental band either. Obviously we're noisy and stuff, but we write proper songs as well."<ref name="flymag">{{cite web |first=JJ |last=Dunning |title=The 'Light Fantastic |url=http://www.the-fly.co.uk/words/features/6013/the-'light-fantastic |date=1 October 2009}}</ref>

Where the band's recorded sound is layered with many melodies, their live sound is a more intense experience with a more visceral wall of noise, something the band wanted to do all along.<ref name="Q&A"/> Graham stated, "We like having the contrast between the record and playing live. There are a lot more instruments on the record. There's only four of us in the band, so we have to keep it as simple as possible. I don't know about you, but I don't like going to see a band that sounds just like their album. That's what we try not to do."<ref name="impose">{{cite web |first=Jeremy |last=Krinsley |title=Twilight Sad's fly by night summer stopover |url=http://www.imposemagazine.com/bytes/twilight-sads-fly-by-night-summ# |date=19 June 2007}}</ref>

In a 2014 interview with Jazz Monroe of ''[[The Skinny (magazine)|The Skinny]]'', James Graham commented on the misconception of the band's "disturbed reputation" pertaining to his lyrics, as well as designer Dave "DLT" Thomas' "darkly suggestive" artwork. Monroe wrote, "There's a misconception that James himself had a difficult childhood; in fact, ''The Skinny'' has it on good authority that the Grahams are proud, attendant fans at many of their gigs." Graham elaborated that, "My mum and dad are actually the biggest supporters of our band. The songs aren’t about me having a really bad childhood; it’s about, from the outside, looking in at other people in my community. And the shite that happened to my family – not in my family. It's about other dickheads influencing our lives, whether or not they realise. Writing these songs is about making people feel things they wouldn't usually feel, things they're scared to feel – loss, anger, depression. To write a love song for somebody would probably be the hardest thing. I've never done that."<ref name="Skinterview">{{cite web |first=Jazz |last=Monroe |title=Breaking Sad: James Graham and Andy MacFarlane on The Twilight Sad's fourth album |url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/music/features/309110-this_records_statement_not_prove_people_wrong_but_prove_people |date=6 October 2014 |access-date=21 November 2014}}</ref>
