'''Kirsty Anna MacColl''' (10 October 1959 – 18 December 2000) was a British singer and songwriter. She recorded several pop hits in the 1980s and 1990s, including "[[There's a Guy Works Down the Chip Shop Swears He's Elvis]]" and cover versions of [[Billy Bragg]]'s "[[A New England#Kirsty MacColl version|A New England]]" and [[The Kinks]]' [[Days (The Kinks song)#Kirsty MacColl version|"Days"]]. Her song "[[They Don't Know (Kirsty MacColl song)|They Don't Know]]" was covered with great success by [[Tracey Ullman]]. MacColl also sang on recordings produced by her then-husband [[Steve Lillywhite]], most notably "[[Fairytale of New York]]" by [[The Pogues]].

==Early life and career==
Kirsty MacColl was the daughter of [[folk music|folk]] singer [[Ewan MacColl]] (1915–1989) and dancer Jean Newlove (1923–2017). Her father was born in England of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] parents. MacColl and her brother, Hamish MacColl, grew up with their mother in [[Croydon]], where she attended Park Hill Primary School, Monks Hill High School and John Newnham High School, making appearances in school plays. At the time of her birth, her father had been in a relationship with folk singer, multi-instrumentalist and songwriter [[Peggy Seeger]] since 1956 (a relationship that would continue until his death in 1989), and already had a son with her.

She came to notice when [[Chiswick Records]] released an EP by local [[punk rock]] band the Drug Addix (originally called Tooting Fruities) with MacColl on backing vocals (''The Drug Addix Make A Record'') under the pseudonym Mandy Doubt (1978). [[Stiff Records]] executives were not impressed with the band, but liked her and subsequently signed her to a solo deal.<ref>{{cite news|title=Obituary Kirsty MacColl|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/dec/20/guardianobituaries.adamsweeting|work=The Guardian|access-date=14 August 2017}}</ref>

==1979–1986==
Her debut solo single "[[They Don't Know (Kirsty MacColl song)|They Don't Know]]", released in 1979, peaked at number two on the Music Week airplay chart.<ref name=airplay>{{Citation | title = REVIEW: Kirsty MacColl, Galore (I.R.S.) | url = http://www.westnet.com/consumable/1995/Feb27.1995/revkirst.html | first = Bob | last = Gajarsky | date = 27 February 1995 | access-date = 4 February 2011 | publisher = Consumable on line | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://archive.today/20120630070910/http://www.westnet.com/consumable/1995/Feb27.1995/revkirst.html | archive-date = 30 June 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirstymaccoll.com/information/articles/1979-1984/nme81/index.htm|title=NME or Melody Maker, 1981|last=Soave|first=Daniela|year=1995|publisher=The Kirsty MacColl web site|access-date=20 May 2010|archive-date=25 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225102949/http://www.kirstymaccoll.com/information/articles/1979-1984/nme81/index.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, a distributors' strike prevented copies of the single getting into [[record store]]s, and the single consequently failed to appear on the [[UK Singles Chart]].

MacColl recorded a follow-up single, "[[You Caught Me Out (song)|You Caught Me Out]]", but felt she lacked Stiff Records's full backing, and left the label shortly before the song was to be released.  The single was pulled, and only a few "white label" promo copies of the single are known to exist.

MacColl moved to [[Polydor Records]] in 1981. She had a number 14 UK hit with "[[There's a Guy Works Down the Chip Shop Swears He's Elvis]]",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://recordcollectormag.com/articles/kirsty-maccoll-remembered|title=KIRSTY MacCOLL REMEMBERED – Record Collector Magazine|website=Recordcollectormag.com}}</ref> from her critically acclaimed debut album ''[[Desperate Character]]''. In 1983, Polydor dropped her just as she had completed recording the songs for a planned second album (to be called ''Real'') which used more synthesizers and had new wave-styled tracks. She returned to Stiff, where pop singles such as "[[Terry (Kirsty MacColl song)|Terry]]" and "[[He's on the Beach]]" were unsuccessful, but a cover of [[Billy Bragg]]'s "[[A New England]]" in 1985 reached number 7 on the UK charts. This included two extra verses specially written for her by Bragg. Also around this time, MacColl wrote and performed the theme song "London Girls" for [[Channel 4]]'s short-lived sitcom ''[[Dream Stuffing]]'' (1984).

In the United States, MacColl was most likely recognisable as the writer of "They Don't Know", when [[Tracey Ullman]] turned it into a ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Top Ten hit.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Paytress |first=Mark |date=March 1994 |title=Kirsty MacColl |url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/kirsty-maccoll-2 |magazine=[[Record Collector]] |access-date=16 October 2019 |via=[[Rock's Backpages]] |url-access=subscription }}</ref> Ullman's version reached No. 8 on the US [[Hot 100]] in April 1984<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/tracey-ullman |title=Tracey Ullman: Hot 100 |website=[[Billboard.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190419152723/https://www.billboard.com/music/tracey-ullman |archive-date=19 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> (and did even better in the UK, hitting No. 2 in September 1983).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/20221/tracey-ullman/ |title=Tracey Ullman: Singles |website=[[Officialcharts.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190420172913/https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/20221/tracey-ullman/ |archive-date=20 April 209 |url-status=live }}</ref> MacColl also sang back-up on the track, providing the "Baay-byy" because it was too high a pitch for Ullman.<ref>{{Cite web|title=BBC Radio 4 - Desert Island Discs, Tracey Ullman, actor and comedian|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00100hn|access-date=2021-10-20|website=BBC|language=en-GB}}</ref>  It was played over the closing credits of Ullman's HBO show ''[[Tracey Takes On...|Tracey Takes On]]''... in 1996. Ullman also recorded three more of MacColl's songs, "You Broke My Heart In 17 Places" and "You Caught Me Out", as the title tracks of her first and second albums respectively, and "Terry" which was released as a single in 1985.

In 1986, she contributed backing vocals for [[the Smiths]] song "[[Ask (song)|Ask]]".<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/shows/anglophenia/blog/2010/12/kirsty-maccoll-remembered-10-years-later|title=Kirsty MacColl Remembered 10 Years Later|first=Kevin|last=Wicks|website=BBC America}}</ref> Kirsty contributed backing vocals to the [[Simple Minds]] 1984 album, ''[[Sparkle in the Rain]]''.

==Chart re-emergence==
When Stiff Records went bankrupt in 1986, MacColl was left unable to record in her own right, as no record company bought her contract from the [[official receiver]]. However, she had regular session work as a backing vocalist, and she frequently sang on records produced or engineered by her husband, [[Steve Lillywhite]], including tracks for [[Robert Plant]], [[The Smiths]], [[Alison Moyet]], [[Shriekback]], [[Simple Minds]], [[Talking Heads]], [[Big Country]], [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]] (of [[ABBA]]) and [[The Wonder Stuff]] among others.  She appeared in the videos "[[Welcome to the Cheap Seats]]" for The Wonder Stuff and "[[(Nothing But) Flowers]]" for Talking Heads (along with [[Johnny Marr]], ex-member of [[The Smiths]]). MacColl also set the track sequencing for [[U2]]'s acclaimed breakthrough album ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'', for which Lillywhite provided mixes.

MacColl re-emerged in the British charts in December 1987, reaching Number 2 with [[The Pogues]] on "[[Fairytale of New York]]", singing a duet with [[Shane MacGowan]]. This led to her accompanying The Pogues on their British and European tour in 1988, an experience which she said helped her temporarily overcome her [[glossophobia|stage fright]].<ref name=RoughGuide>{{cite book|last=Buckley|first=Jonathan|title=Rock : the rough guide|year=1999|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=978-1-85828-457-6|pages=622–623|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fie47qSuTsoC&q=Kirsty+MacColl+stage+fright&pg=PA1715|edition=2. ed., expanded and complety rev.|access-date=15 December 2011|quote=...she toured Ireland and suffered from stage fright...}}</ref> In March 1989, MacColl sang backing vocals on the [[Happy Mondays]]' ''[[Hallelujah (Happy Mondays album)|Hallelujah]]'' EP.

After the contract issue was resolved, MacColl returned to recording as a solo artist and received critical acclaim upon the release of ''[[Kite (Kirsty MacColl album)|Kite]]'' (LP) in 1989. The album was widely praised by critics, and featured collaborations with [[David Gilmour]] and [[Johnny Marr]]. MacColl's lyrics addressed life in [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s Britain and addressed the vagaries of love in "[[Don't Come the Cowboy with Me Sonny Jim!]]" Although ''Kite'' contained many original compositions, MacColl's biggest chart success from the album was the cover of [[The Kinks]]' song "[[Days (The Kinks song)|Days]]", which gave her a UK Top 20 hit in July 1989. A bonus track on the CD version of ''Kite'' was a cover of [[the Smiths]] song "You Just Haven't Earned It Yet, Baby".

During this time, MacColl featured on the British TV sketch comedy ''[[French and Saunders]]'', appearing as herself, singing songs including "15 Minutes" and "Don't Come The Cowboy With Me Sonny Jim!" (from ''Kite''), "Still Life" (the B-side of the "Days" single), "Girls On Bikes" (a reworking of B-side "Am I Right?") and, with comedy duo Raw Sex, the [[Frank Sinatra|Frank]] and [[Nancy Sinatra]] hit "[[Somethin' Stupid]]". She continued to write and record, releasing the album ''[[Electric Landlady]]'' in 1991. The album's title was coined by [[Johnny Marr]] as a play on the [[Jimi Hendrix]] album title ''[[Electric Ladyland]]''. It included her most successful chart hit in North America, "[[Walking Down Madison]]", co-written with Marr and a Top 30 hit in the UK. Despite the song's U.S. chart success, ''Landlady'' was not a hit for Virgin Records and in 1992, when Virgin was sold to EMI, MacColl was dropped from the label.

==Later work==
MacColl released ''[[Titanic Days]]'', informed by her failing marriage with Lillywhite,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,101956,00.html|title=Elegy for a One-Woman Girl Group|first=Ed|last=Grant|date=9 March 2001|website=Content.time.com}}</ref> in 1993, but [[ZTT Records]] had agreed only to release the album as a "one-off" and declined to sign her to a contract. In 1995, she released two new singles on Virgin, "[[Caroline (Kirsty MacColl song)|Caroline]]" and a cover of [[Lou Reed]]'s "[[Perfect Day (Lou Reed song)|Perfect Day]]" (a duet with [[Evan Dando]]), together with the "best of" compilation ''[[Galore (Kirsty MacColl album)|Galore]]''.

''Galore'' became MacColl's only album to reach the top 10 in the [[UK Albums Chart]], but neither of the new singles, nor a re-released "Days", made the Top 40. MacColl did not record again for several years; her frustration with the music business was exacerbated by a lengthy case of writer's block. MacColl herself admitted that she was ready to give up her music career and become an English teacher in South America.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In 1998, the album ''[[What Do Pretty Girls Do?]]'' was released, containing BBC Radio 1 live sessions (featuring [[Billy Bragg]] on two songs) that were broadcast between 1989 and 1995.

After several trips to Cuba and Brazil, MacColl recorded the [[world music]]-inspired (particularly Cuban and other Latin American forms) ''[[Tropical Brainstorm]]'', which was released in 2000 to critical acclaim.  It included the song "[[In These Shoes?]]", which garnered airplay in the U.S., was covered by [[Bette Midler]] and featured in the HBO show ''[[Sex and the City]]''. After MacColl's death it was adopted by [[Catherine Tate]] as the theme tune for her [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] [[The Catherine Tate Show|TV show]]<ref name="auto"/> and featured on the soundtrack to film ''[[Kinky Boots (film)|Kinky Boots]]''.

However, despite the relative success of ''Tropical Brainstorm'', MacColl had been dropped by [[V2 Records]] prior to her death.

==Television==
MacColl featured regularly in the third series of the ''[[French and Saunders]] Show'', a comedy show on the BBC. Unlike other guests on the show, she was not part of any of the sketches but sang her songs whilst performing as in a music video. She also made regular appearances on [[Jools Holland]]'s TV shows, also on the BBC, singing during the 1995 ''[[Hootenanny (UK TV series)|Hootenanny]]'' a rendition of "Miss Otis Regrets" with the Pipes and Drums of the [[Irish Guards]].

MacColl appeared in the 1991 Channel 4 historic musical fantasy ''The Ghosts of Oxford Street'' as [[Kitty Fisher]], performing "Fairytale of New York" opposite Shane MacGowan as the Duke of York.

On 18 December 2000, she and her sons went diving at the Chankanaab reef, part of the National Marine Park of Cozumel, in a designated diving area that watercraft were restricted from entering. With the group was a local veteran divemaster, Iván Díaz. As the group was surfacing from a dive, a powerboat moving at high speed entered the restricted area. MacColl saw the boat coming before her sons did. Louis, age 13 at the time, was not in its path, but Jamie, age 15, was. She was able to push him out of the way (he sustained minor head and rib injuries), but she was struck by the boat which ran over her.

===Aftermath===
The powerboat involved in the collision was controlled by [[Comercial_Mexicana#Executives|Guillermo González Nova]], multimillionaire president of the [[Comercial Mexicana]] supermarket chain, who was on board with members of his family. The boat was owned by [[Carlos González Nova]], brother and founder of the chain.

Cen Yam was found guilty of [[culpable homicide]] and was sentenced to 2 years 10 months in prison. He was allowed under Mexican law to pay a [[Punitive damages|punitive fine]] of 1,034 [[Mexican peso|pesos]] (about €63, £61 or US$90) in lieu of the prison sentence. He was also ordered to pay approximately US$2,150 in restitution to MacColl's family, an amount based on his wages.

===Justice for Kirsty campaign===
MacColl's family launched the Justice for Kirsty campaign in response to the events surrounding her death. Among the group's efforts:
* Lawyers for MacColl's family and the group campaigned for a judicial review into the events surrounding her death. They were in repeated contact with the Mexican government and made an application to the [[Inter-American Commission of Human Rights|Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]].
* MacColl's friends and family were critical of what they perceived as a lack of cooperation from the Mexican authorities. In May 2006, Emilio Cortez Ramírez, a federal prosecutor in Cozumel, was found liable for breach of authority in his handling of the MacColl case.<ref name="prosecutor-liable">{{cite web

{{Multiple image | direction = vertical| image1=Empty bench in Soho Square.jpg|width=200|image2=Empty bench close-up.jpg|caption1=Kirsty MacColl [[memorial bench]] in Soho Square|caption2=A close-up of the engraved lyrics}}
Since MacColl's death, [[Billy Bragg]] has always included her extra verses when performing "[[A New England]]". She was honoured in 2002 with a memorial concert in London at the [[Royal Festival Hall]], featuring a number of musicians who had worked with her or been influenced by her.  A similar memorial concert took place on her birthday (10 October 2010) at the [[O2 Shepherd's Bush Empire]], to support her favourite charity, The Music Fund for Cuba.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.musicweek.com/news/read/maccoll-memorial-gig-to-benefit-cuban-artists/043154|title=MacColl memorial gig to benefit Cuban artists|website=Musicweek.com}}</ref>

In 2001, a bench was placed by the southern entrance to London's [[Soho Square]] as a memorial to her, after a lyric from one of her most poignant songs: "One day I'll be waiting there / No empty bench in Soho Square". Every year on the Sunday nearest to MacColl's birthday, 10 October, fans from all over the world hold a gathering at the bench to pay tribute to her and sing her songs.

MacColl continues to receive media exposure; in 2004, ''Kirsty MacColl: The One and Only,''  a biography of MacColl written by Karen O'Brien, was published. A retrospective three-CD set spanning her full career, ''[[From Croydon to Cuba: An Anthology|From Croydon to Cuba]],'' was released in 2005. ''Titanic Days'' was re-released in 2005 as a deluxe 2-CD set, and ''Kite'' and ''Electric Landlady'' were also remastered and rereleased with additional tracks. Her first album, ''Desperate Character,'' was given its first CD issue in 2012 on the Salvo label. On 7 August 2005, ''[[The Best of Kirsty MacColl]]'', a single-disc compilation that included a "new" single, "Sun on the Water", made its debut on the UK album charts at number 17, climbing to No. 12 a week later.

MacColl's collaboration with the Pogues, "[[Fairytale of New York]]", remains a perennial Christmas favourite. In 2004, 2005 and 2006, it was voted favourite Christmas song in a poll by music video channel [[VH1]].<ref name="bbc-fairytale">{{cite news

}}</ref> The song was re-released in the UK in December 2005, with proceeds being split between the Justice for Kirsty Campaign and charities for the homeless. The re-release reached number 3 on the UK charts, and spent five weeks in the top 75 over the Christmas and New Year period. It reached the top 10 for the third time in its history in 2006, peaking at number 6, and charted yet again in December 2007. The song has also made the Top 20 in subsequent years, and has now spent more time in the top 20 than any other song. With the exception of the 2005 and 2012 re-releases, the seasonal re-charting in the 21st century is due to download sales, and not due to further releases (download sales counting toward the singles chart since 2005). A 7" single was produced in 2012 to mark the 25th anniversary of its original appearance (Rhino Records WEA400), backed with an instrumental version.
