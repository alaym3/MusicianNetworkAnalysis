=== 2013–2017: Nouvelle Star and career beginnings ===
In February 2014, Yseult competed in the final of the Nouvelle Star, having auditioned and made her way through the competition since the show aired in October 2013. She competed in the final against Mathieu Saikaly, the winner of the season, and performed songs such as [[Roar (song)|Roar]], [[Feeling Good]], and [[Wasting My Young Years]] throughout her duration on the show.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Yseult - biographie, news, clips, paroles de chansons...|url=https://www.nrj.fr/artistes/yseult|access-date=2020-12-15|website=NRJ.fr|language=fr}}</ref>

Following the show, Onguenet signed to Polydor Records under the name Yseult, and announced that she was preparing her debut album, working with French composer and singer, [[Da Silva (singer)|Emmanuel Da Silva]].

In May 2014, Yseult released the lead single to her album, ''"La Vague"'', the video to which she later posted on her [[Vevo]] channel. As of December 2020, the music video has over one million views.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Yseult - La Vague - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7IqYee8rME|access-date=2020-12-15|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref> Prior to the release of her album, she uploaded her covers to [[It's a Man's Man's Man's World]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Yseult - It's A Man's Man's Man's World (Covered By Yseult) - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwEczRizdwA|access-date=2020-12-15|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref> and [[La mamma (song)|La Mamma]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Yseult - La mamma - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fqq7wCpXBw|access-date=2020-12-15|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref> on [[YouTube|Youtube]].

On January 5, 2015, she released her debut album, titled ''Yseult''. The album peaked at no. 69 on the [[Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique|French album chart]], selling just 5,000 copies.<ref>{{Cite web|last=à 13h00|first=Par Tanneguy de KerpoissonLe 15 juillet 2019|date=2019-07-15|title=Depuis "Nouvelle Star", Yseult a suivi sa voix|url=https://www.leparisien.fr/culture-loisirs/musique/depuis-nouvelle-star-yseult-a-suivi-sa-voix-15-07-2019-8117157.php|access-date=2020-12-15|website=leparisien.fr|language=fr-FR}}</ref> The album's commercial performance was a disappointment for both Onguenet and her label, and influenced her decision to end her contract with Polydor a couple years later. Nevertheless, Yseult went on to release three videos for ''Bye Bye Bye'', ''Pour l'impossible'', and ''Summer Love'', all songs from her album, across 2015.

In March 2017, Yseult released her final single with the label, a cover of [[Blondie (band)|Blondie's]] [[Heart of Glass (song)|Heart of Glass]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Shazam|url=https://www.shazam.com/track/344334133/heart-of-glass|access-date=2020-12-18|website=Shazam}}</ref> In April 2017, she worked in a writing seminar for the Black Eyed Peas,<ref>{{Cite news|title=MEET YSEULT, THE FRENCH TRIPLE THREAT|language=en-GB|work=ASOS|url=https://www.asos.com/women/fashion-feed/2018_10_09-tue/asos-mag-meet-yseult/|access-date=2020-12-18}}</ref> organised by Polydor, after which she decided to end her contract with the label later that year.<ref>{{Cite news|title=MEET YSEULT, THE FRENCH TRIPLE THREAT|language=en-GB|work=ASOS|url=https://www.asos.com/women/fashion-feed/2018_10_09-tue/asos-mag-meet-yseult/|access-date=2020-12-18}}</ref>
