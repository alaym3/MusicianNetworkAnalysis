The band were founded at the [[University of Dundee]] in 1994 by Lightbody, [[Mark McClelland]], and Michael Morrison of [[Shrug (band)|Shrug]]. After briefly using the name Polarbear, releasing the [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Starfighter Pilot]]'' (1997) and losing Morrison as a member, the band became Snow Patrol in 1997 and added Quinn to its line-up. Their first two studio albums, ''[[Songs for Polarbears]]'' (1998) and ''[[When It's All Over We Still Have to Clear Up]]'' (2001), were commercially unsuccessful and were released by the independent record label [[Jeepster Records]]. The band then signed to the major record label [[Polydor Records]] in 2002.

Connolly joined Snow Patrol in 2002, and after their major-label debut album, ''[[Final Straw]]'', the following year, with "[[Run (Snow Patrol song)|Run]]" the album’s major hit, the band rose to national fame. The album was certified [[Music recording sales certification|5× platinum]] in the UK. Their next studio album, ''[[Eyes Open]]'' (2006), and its hit single, "[[Chasing Cars]]"—reported in 2019 to be the most-played song of the 21st century on UK radio—propelled the band to greater international fame. The album topped the [[UK Albums Chart]] and was the best-selling British album of the year. In 2008, the band released their fifth studio album, ''[[A Hundred Million Suns]]''; then, in 2009, they released their first compilation album, ''[[Up to Now]]''; and, in 2011, released their sixth studio album, ''[[Fallen Empires (album)|Fallen Empires]]''. The band released their seventh album, ''[[Wildness (album)|Wildness]]'', on 25 May 2018.

During the course of their career, Snow Patrol have won seven [[Meteor Music Awards#Winners|Meteor Ireland Music Awards]] and have been nominated for six [[Brit Awards]] and one [[Grammy Award]]. ''Final Straw'', ''Eyes Open'' and ''A Hundred Million Suns'' albums have sold 10 million copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/a176894/snow-patrol-to-release-greatest-hits.html|title=Snow Patrol to release greatest hits|last=Balls|first=David|date=11 September 2009|work=[[Digital Spy]]|access-date=11 September 2009}}</ref>

==History==
===Early years (1994–1997)===
[[File:Shrug - December 1994.jpg|thumb|Snow Patrol originated from a band called [[Shrug (band)|Shrug]], which formed in 1994 and consisted of [[Gary Lightbody]], Michael Morrison and [[Mark McClelland]].]]

Snow Patrol were originally formed in early 1994 by [[University of Dundee]] students [[Gary Lightbody]], [[Mark McClelland]], and Michael Morrison under the name [[Shrug (band)|Shrug]].<ref name="brianbebo">{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/music/interviews/snow-patrol-video-interview-quiz-biography-pictures.html |title=Snow Patrol |publisher=[[Channel 4]] |access-date=14 October 2008 }}</ref> The band started by performing gigs at the university and surrounding pubs such as Lucifer's Mill. Their first EP was entitled "The Yogurt vs. Yoghurt Debate". In 1996, they changed their name to Polarbear to avoid issues with any American bands that were also named Shrug. Shortly afterwards, drummer Michael Morrison left the band after suffering a breakdown and returned to Northern Ireland. In mid-1997, Polarbear released a three-track [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Starfighter Pilot]]'', on the [[Electric Honey (label)|Electric Honey]] label.<ref name="pilotis">{{cite web|url=http://www.interscope.com/artist/releases/detail.aspx?pid=10&aid=410 |title=Snow Patrol – Starfighter Pilot EP |access-date=17 July 2008 |publisher=[[Interscope Records]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207020739/http://www.interscope.com/artist/releases/detail.aspx?pid=10&aid=410 |archive-date=7 February 2009 }}</ref> The band again renamed, this time to Snow Patrol in 1997,<ref name="allmusic"/> because of a naming conflict with [[Polar Bear (American band)|another band]] of the same name fronted by [[Jane's Addiction]]'s ex-bassist [[Eric Avery]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snowpatrol.com/band|title=Biography|website=Snowpatrol.com|access-date=10 May 2014}}</ref>

===''Songs for Polarbears'' and ''When It's All Over We Still Have to Clear Up'' (1997–2001)===

Snow Patrol joined independent label [[Jeepster Records|Jeepster]] in 1997, home of [[Belle & Sebastian]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/music-magazine/music-magazine-features/label-profile/label-profile-jeepster-772565.html |title=Label profile: Jeepster |last=Birke |first=Sarah |date=23 January 2008 |work=[[The Independent]] |access-date=10 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5kww0nasi?url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/music-magazine/music-magazine-features/label-profile/label-profile-jeepster-772565.html |archive-date=1 November 2009 }}</ref> Jeepster had the same idea for Snow Patrol as the approach they had with Belle & Sebastian, who had become popular by word-of-mouth, without heavy promotion. The band were happy to be associated with an indie label, because it provided them greater independence than a major label. At that time, they were quoted as saying they expected Jeepster wouldn't expect them to have a strict work ethic or focus too much on promotional efforts.<ref name="STRUGGLE">{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/07/24/1090464906092.html |title=That's Snow business |date=25 July 2004 |newspaper=[[The Age]]|access-date=29 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5kskyWtQq?url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/07/24/1090464906092.html |archive-date=29 October 2009 }}</ref>

The band began to work harder and tour more.

The band's manager at the time was Danny McIntosh. Lightbody has described him as "the angriest man in pop: great, great man". He has said that he loved the band "with every atom in his body", and was never angry towards them. He has credited him with keeping the band together in those years. McIntosh had a gold coloured splitter bus in which the band used to travel to play concerts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spinner.com/2009/11/23/snow-patrol-get-revolutionary-with-back-catalogue/ |title=Snow Patrol get revolutionary with back catalogue |last=Dowling |first=Stephen |date=23 November 2009 |publisher=[[Spinner.com]] |access-date=24 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130630090442/http://www.spinner.com/2009/11/23/snow-patrol-get-revolutionary-with-back-catalogue/ |archive-date=30 June 2013 }}</ref>

==Recognition==
The success of Snow Patrol has influenced the thriving Belfast music scene positively. This includes Lightbody, who returned to the city and now lives there. The band's kindness towards local bands, partly by founding Polar Music, and Lightbody being an active part of the [[Oh Yeah (music centre)|Oh Yeah Music Centre]] reportedly resulted in high optimism in the scene in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/travel/2009/0919/1224254836875.html |title=Magical musical tour |last=Clayton-Lea |first=Tony |date=19 September 2009 |newspaper=[[The Irish Times]] |access-date=1 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5kD1Q7sVJ?url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/travel/2009/0919/1224254836875.html |archive-date=1 October 2009 }}</ref>

==Other ventures==
Snow Patrol founded Polar Music, a publishing company run through Kobalt Music. The venture is independent from the band's publishing deal with [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]].
