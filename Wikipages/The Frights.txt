'''The Frights''' are an American [[Surf punk (music genre)|surf punk]] band formed in [[San Diego, California]], in 2012. Since 2017, the band has consisted of Mikey Carnevale (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Richard Dotson (bass guitar, backing vocals), Marc Finn (drums) and Jordan Clark (lead guitar, backing vocals).

== History ==
The Frights were formed in 2012 by lead vocalist/guitarist Mikey Carnevale, bassist Richard Dotson, and drummer Adam Lomnitzer as a simple time-killer project following the trio's graduation from high school. Their musical style mixed elements of [[Surf music|surf]], [[Punk rock|classic punk]], and [[doo-wop]], resulting in "tunes that managed to be catchy, aggressive, and playfully ridiculous all at once."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Deming|first=Mark|date=2020|title=The Frights|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-frights-mn0003454218/biography|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=June 12, 2020|website=AllMusic}}</ref>

The band separated shortly after formation, with all three members attending college, but rejoined in December 2012 to play a one-off show during Christmas break. The intent was to disband once again after this show, but the band were approached by an audience member who offered to sign the band to local label Postmark Records.

The Frights released their first single “''Hippie Lips”'' on the Postmark Records YouTube channel in February 2013. In March 2013, The Frights' debut EP ''Dead Beach'' was released by Postmark. This was followed by their second EP, ''Fur Sure'', in May 2013, and their self-titled debut studio album on October 31, 2013.

In 2014, the band would continue to perform live as well as record and release new material starting with the single "Tongues / Puppy Knuckles" in April.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dafrights.bandcamp.com/album/tongues-puppy-knuckles|title=Tongues / Puppy Knuckles, by The Frights|website=The Frights|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> On July 22, The Frights and Death Lens would release a split EP titled ''DeathFrights''. This marked the band's final release with Postmark, as well as the exit of drummer Adam Lomnitzer who would be replaced by Marc Finn shortly after.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/6887759/the-frights/biography |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-12-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223073232/http://www.billboard.com/artist/6887759/the-frights/biography |archive-date=December 23, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.postmarkrecords.com/the-frights.html|title=The Frights|website=Postmark records|access-date=January 9, 2018}}</ref> Due to other commitments, Finn would not be able to gig consistently with the group until spring 2015, during which Ryan Ward would sit in on drums. Afterwards, Ward would continue to play with the band as a guitarist until his departure in September, 2016.

The Frights signed with independent label [[Dangerbird Records]] in 2015. Subsequently, they released their sophomore studio album ''You Are Going to Hate This'', produced by [[FIDLAR]] frontman Zac Carper, on February 12, 2016.

In February, 2018 The Frights returned to the studio with Carper<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stitchedsound.com/album-review-the-frights-hypochondriac/|title=Album Review: The Frights "Hypochondriac"|date=2018-08-27|website=Stitched Sound|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-05}}</ref> to record their third studio album ''[[Hypochondriac (album)|Hypochondriac]]'', this marked a shift in lyrical themes and musical style, with frontman Mikey Carnevale writing more personal songs about past relationships and mental health.
