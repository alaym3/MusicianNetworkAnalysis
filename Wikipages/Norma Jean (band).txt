'''Norma Jean''' (formerly known as '''Luti-Kriss''') is an<!--DO NOT ADD OR CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE LEAD WITHOUT FIRST CONSULTING THE DISCUSSION PAGE--> American [[metalcore]] band from [[Douglasville, Georgia]], a suburb of [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]. Since their inception in 1997, numerous lineup changes have left the band with no original members. To date, Norma Jean has released eight studio albums and received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination in 2006 for [[Grammy Award for Best Recording Package|Best Recording Package]] for their second album ''[[O' God, the Aftermath]]''. The band's name is derived from the real name of actress [[Marilyn Monroe]].

==History==
{{BLP sources section|date=August 2019}}

===Luti-Kriss and debut album (1997–2004)===
Norma Jean formed in 1997 under the name Luti-Kriss with [[Josh Scogin]] on vocals, guitarists Scottie Henry and Chris Day, Josh Swafford on bass, Mick Bailey on turntables, and [[Daniel Davison]] on drums. The band recorded a split EP with [[Travail (band)|Travail]] that was released in 1999 through [[Pluto Records]]. Luti-Kriss's songs from the split would later be released on ''5ep'', which was released on July 25, 2000 through Pluto Records.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Pluto Records]]|url=https://plutorecords.bandcamp.com/album/5ep|title=5ep {{!}} Pluto Records|access-date=January 7, 2020}}</ref> The sound of theses EPs differed greatly from future releases, featuring an aggressive [[nu metal]] and [[rap metal]] style.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|last=Torreano|first=Bradley|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/5-mw0000974773|title=5 - Luti-Kriss|access-date=January 7, 2020}}</ref> Shortly after the release of ''5ep'', Swafford would leave the band and be replaced by Josh Doolittle. The band then would start working on the debut album ''[[Throwing Myself]]'', with Bailey leaving during the album's production. 

Evolving from Luti-Kriss, the original Norma Jean lineup consisted of the final Luti-Kriss lineup, utilizing additional percussion on recordings instead of turntables. Drummer [[Daniel Davison]], explained that the band got their name from actress [[Marilyn Monroe]], whose real name is Norma Jeane Baker. It was not until after they decided upon that name that they "were looking at a book" which apparently claimed that "Norma" means "pattern", and "Jean" means "God's grace and mercy", combined into "Patterns of grace and mercy".<ref>{{cite web |author=Karma E. |url=http://www.fourteeng.net/normajean.html |title=Norma Jean Interview |publisher=Fourteeng.net |access-date=November 17, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120909010403/http://www.fourteeng.net/normajean.html |archive-date=September 9, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> In 2002 the band released ''[[Bless the Martyr and Kiss the Child]]'' on [[Solid State Records]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.solidstaterecords.com/artist_bio.php?id=205&album=420 |title=Artist |publisher=Solid State Records |access-date=November 17, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222045421/http://www.solidstaterecords.com/artist_bio.php?id=205&album=420 |archive-date=February 22, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Their original vocalist [[Josh Scogin]] left the band shortly after the release of ''Bless the Martyr and Kiss the Child'', stating that "it was just something that I felt led to do." Scogin has been known to join in with Norma Jean during live performances to sing "Memphis Will Be Laid To Waste" since his departure. Original bassist Joshua Doolittle also left the band around the same time as Scogin. Doolittle was replaced by Jake Schultz.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.solidstaterecords.com/artist_bio.php?id=201&expand=1 |title=Artist |publisher=Solid State Records |access-date=November 17, 2012}}</ref> Scogin left the band and later went on to start [[The Chariot (band)|the Chariot]]; he was replaced by Brad Norris for about a year and nine months.

=== Early releases (2005–2009)===

In March 2005 they released their second album, titled ''[[O God, the Aftermath]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.solidstaterecords.com/artist_bio.php?id=205&album=486 |title=Artist |publisher=Solid State Records |access-date=November 17, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222045853/http://www.solidstaterecords.com/artist_bio.php?id=205&album=486 |archive-date=February 22, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was also Cory Brandan's first album performance for Norma Jean. The artwork for the band's second album, ''O God, the Aftermath'' was nominated for [[Best Recording Package]] at the [[Grammy Awards of 2006]].  The artwork was designed by [[Invisible Creature|Asterisk]] studios in Seattle, Washington.

''Redeemer'', their third album, was recorded with producer [[Ross Robinson]]. On September 21, 2007, original drummer [[Daniel Davison]] announced that he would be leaving the band after their current tour ended, via the band's official website. His last show was on November 7, 2007 at Irving Plaza in New York, NY.

On December 17, 2007, Norma Jean announced that they would start writing for their new album, ''[[The Anti Mother]]'',<ref>Synyard, Dave.[https://archive.today/20120708204224/http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=125&csid2=4&fid1=33228 " Norma Jean Power Up "], ''[[Exclaim!]]'', September 2008.</ref> in January, record in April, and will be playing the entire 2008 [[Warped Tour]].

In an interview with Exclaim! Magazine that was published the day of the ''Meridional'' album release, drummer Chris Raines spoke of how the sound of ''Meridional'' came to be and what influenced it." The last few records have been doing different things; this one truthfully mixed a lot of those records with what we wanted to do this time. I think we took all the good that we liked from the past records and added the new touch that we wanted to put on it, which was a heavier and darker theme."

Drummer Chris Raines was replaced by Matt Marquez in late 2010 with no formal announcement made for this exchange or if Raines would ever return.<ref name="drummag">{{cite web| last = Doerschuk| first = Andy| title = Norma Jean Enlists Matt Marquez For Tour| work = Drum!| publisher = Enter Music Publishing, Inc.| date = November 23, 2010| url = http://www.drummagazine.com/wiretap/post/norma-jean-enlists-matt-marquez-for-tour/| access-date = March 11, 2011| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110109102535/http://www.drummagazine.com/wiretap/post/norma-jean-enlists-matt-marquez-for-tour/| archive-date = January 9, 2011| df = mdy-all}}</ref> In 2016, Raines addressed leaving the band in an interview with Trav Turner (formerly of [[Aletheian]], [[UnTeachers]], [[Solamors]]) that it was mainly family issues.<ref name=ATSG>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/as-the-story-grows/id962812433?mt=2#episodeGuid=db9b5fa1-ef3a-4064-8ced-a07f6d491246|title=Chris Raines of Spitfire, Sunndrug|publisher=As The Story Grows|first=Chris|last=Raines|interviewer=Trav Turner|date=March 20, 2016|access-date=March 20, 2016}}</ref>
