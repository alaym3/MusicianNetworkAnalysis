Subsequently, he embarked on a solo career which led to international recognition and made Idol a lead artist during the [[MTV]]-driven "[[Second British Invasion]]" in the United States. The name "Billy Idol" was inspired by a schoolteacher's description of him as "idle".<ref name="Radio with Pictures">{{cite web|title=Radio with Pictures|publisher=Television New Zealand alternative music show interview with [[Karyn Hay]] (cue to 04:30s), broadcast April 1984|url=https://www.nzonscreen.com/title/radio-with-pictures-billy-idol-1984|access-date=25 June 2019}}</ref>

Idol began his music career in late 1976 as a guitarist in the punk rock band [[Chelsea (English band)|Chelsea]]. However, he soon left the group. With his former bandmate [[Tony James (musician)|Tony James]], Idol formed Generation X. With Idol as lead singer, the band achieved success in the United Kingdom and released three albums on [[Chrysalis Records]], then disbanded. In 1981, Idol moved to New York City to pursue his solo career in collaboration with guitarist [[Steve Stevens]]. His debut studio album, ''[[Billy Idol (album)|Billy Idol]]'' (1982), was a commercial success. With music videos for singles "[[Dancing with Myself]]" and "[[White Wedding (song)|White Wedding]]" Idol soon became a staple of then newly-established MTV.

Idol's second studio album, ''[[Rebel Yell (album)|Rebel Yell]]'' (1983), was a major commercial success, featuring hit singles "[[Rebel Yell (song)|Rebel Yell]]" and "[[Eyes Without a Face (song)|Eyes Without a Face]]". The album was certified [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for shipment of two million copies in the US. In 1986, he released ''[[Whiplash Smile]]''. Having accumulated three UK top 10 singles ("Rebel Yell", "White Wedding" and "[[Mony Mony#Billy Idol version|Mony Mony]]") Idol released a 1988 greatest hits album titled ''[[Idol Songs: 11 of the Best]]''; the album went platinum in the United Kingdom. Idol then released ''[[Charmed Life (Billy Idol album)|Charmed Life]]'' (1990) and the [[concept album]] ''[[Cyberpunk (album)|Cyberpunk]]'' (1993).

Idol spent the second half of the 1990s focusing on his personal life out of the public eye. He made a musical comeback with the release of ''[[Devil's Playground (album)|Devil's Playground]]'' (2005) and again with ''[[Kings & Queens of the Underground]]'' (2014).

==Early life==
Idol was born William Michael Albert Broad on 30 November, 1955 in [[Stanmore]], Middlesex, England.{{sfn|Guinness|1992|p=1222}} His parents were devout [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] and attended church regularly. In 1958, when he was two years old, he moved with his parents to [[Patchogue]], New York. They also lived in Rockville Centre, New York. His younger sister, Jane, was born during this time. The family returned to England four years later and settled in [[Dorking]], Surrey.<ref name=filmr>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/96/Billy-Idol.html |title=Film Reference biography |publisher=Filmreference.com |access-date=11 October 2011}}</ref> In 1971, the family moved to [[Bromley]] in southeastern London, where Idol attended [[Ravensbourne School (Bromley)|Ravensbourne School for Boys]]. His family later moved to the [[Worthing]] suburb of [[Goring-by-Sea]] in West Sussex, where he attended [[Worthing High School, West Sussex|Worthing High School for Boys]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Billy|last=Idol|title=Dancing with Myself|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2015|isbn=9781451628517}}</ref> In October 1975, he attended the University of Sussex to pursue an English degree and lived on-campus (East Slope), but left after year one in 1976. He then went on to join the [[Bromley Contingent]] of [[Sex Pistols]] fans, a loose gang that travelled into town when the band played.<ref name="Telegraph">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/3557048/Billy-Idol-the-return-of-Billy-the-kid.html |title=Billy Idol: the return of Billy the kid |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=24 July 2008 |access-date=9 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rcnVLioLCNIC&q=bromley+contingent+billy+idol&pg=PA33 |title=''The Roxy London WC2: A Punk History'' - Paul Marko |access-date=9 April 2014|isbn=9780955658303 |year=2007 |last1=Marko |first1=Paul }}</ref>

==Career==
===1976–1981: Generation X===
{{main|Generation X (band)}}

The name "Billy Idol" was coined due to a schoolteacher's description of Idol as "idle".<ref>Edmunds, Ben, untitled essay in ''Greatest Hits'' (2001)</ref> In an interview on 21 November 1983, Idol said the name "Billy Idol" "was a bit of a goof, but part of the old English school of rock. It was a 'double thing' not just a poke at the superstar-like people ... It was fun, you know?"<ref>ConcertVault interview 21 November 1983</ref> In another interview for ''[[BBC Breakfast]]'' in October 2014, he said that he wanted to use the name "Billy Idle", but thought the name would be unavailable due to its similarity to the name of [[Monty Python]] star [[Eric Idle]] and chose Billy Idol instead.<ref>{{YouTube|o0cZL_rDKS0|"BBC Breakfast Billy Idol Interview (27 October 2014)"}}. BBC. Retrieved 28 October 2014</ref> Idol has claimed in interviews that the name was an inspired response to being described on his school report card as "idle" by his Chemistry teacher, a subject which he admits he hated and in which he underachieved.<ref name="Radio with Pictures"/>

In late 1976, he joined the newly-formed West London 1960s [[retro-rock]] band [[Chelsea (band)|Chelsea]] as a guitarist.<ref>History of the band 'Chelsea'{{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130003950/http://steveharnett.com/Chelsea.html |date=30 January 2016 }}</ref> The act's singer/frontman [[Gene October]] styled Idol's image, advising him to change his short sighted eye-glasses for contact lenses, and dye his hair blonde with a [[crew cut]] for a retro-1950s rocker look. After a few weeks performing with ''Chelsea'', Idol and [[Tony James (musician)|Tony James]], the band's bass guitarist, quit the act and co-founded [[Generation X (band)|Generation X]], with Idol switching from guitarist to the role of singer/frontman. Generation X was one of the first punk bands to appear on the BBC Television music programme ''[[Top of the Pops]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4351/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography by Greg Prato |publisher=AllMusic|access-date=30 November 2011}}</ref> Although a punk rock band, they were inspired by mid-1960s British pop, in sharp contrast to their more militant peers, with Idol stating; "We were saying the opposite to [[the Clash]] and the Pistols. They were singing 'No Elvis, Beatles or the Rolling Stones', but we were honest about what we liked. The truth was we were all building our music on the Beatles and the Stones".<ref name="Telegraph"/>
In 1977, Idol sang 'Your Generation' on the '[[Marc (TV series)]]'. Generation X signed with Chrysalis Records, released three albums, performed in the 1980 film ''[[D.O.A. (1980 film)|D.O.A.]]'', and then disbanded.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Gold & Platinum|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/|access-date=2021-11-05|website=RIAA|language=en-US}}</ref>
