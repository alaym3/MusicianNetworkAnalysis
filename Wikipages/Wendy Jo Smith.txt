Smith's first release was the rap album ''The Gospel According to Ho'', for which the music video for the track ''Bitch, I Stole Yo' Purse'' was produced. The video earned its way into circulation on the cable music video channel [[Logo TV]]. Logo viewers voted the video the "ultimate funniest video in February 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.logotv.com/video/wendy-ho/175368/bitch-i-stole-yo-purse.jhtml?id=1582266 |title=The Click List: Ultimate Funniest Videos, 02.01.08 |publisher=[[Logo TV]] |accessdate=September 26, 2013 |date=February 1, 2008}}</ref> The television series ''[[Nip/Tuck]]'' also hired [[Jennifer Coolidge]] to play a parody of the Wendy Ho persona called "Hot Coco", who sings a song titled ''Yo Stank'' from an album titled ''The Gospel According to Coco'' (the name of which parodies the title of Smith's first album). After the performance Coolidge stated "Wendy Ho is about as cool as it gets. I'd never seen anything like her."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.advocate.com/comedy/2010/04/01/jennifer-coolidge-dinahs-best-show?page=0,3 |title=Comedy |accessdate=September 26, 2013 |date=April 1, 2010 |author=Brandon Voss |publisher=[[Advocate Weekly Newspapers|Advocate]]}}</ref>

The song ''Fuck Me'' became a favorite among drag queens in the United States, who began commonly performing to the song after its release. Smith later released a remixed version of the song on her album ''Number 2'' in the summer of 2010 and released her second full album ''Yes, I'm a Ho!'' in October 2010.<ref name=int /><ref name=ddd /><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2012/01/26/out-about-jan-27/ |title=Out & About: Jan. 27 |date=January 26, 2012 |accessdate=September 26, 2013 |newspaper=Washington Blade}}</ref> Television appearances for Smith have included her appearance on the Showtime series ''I Can't Believe I'm Still Single''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.banderasnews.com/1203/ent-wendyho.htm |title=Wendy Ho 'The Queen of Sass and Crass' at The Palm |author=Tracy Parks |publisher=Banderas News |accessdate=September 26, 2013 |date=March 14, 2012}}</ref> In 2014, her album ''Greatest Shits'' entered the Billboard Comedy Album top 10 chart, hitting number eight for the November 1, 2014 list.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/2014-11-01/comedy-albums |title=Billboard Comedy Albums |magazine=Billboard |date=November 1, 2014 |accessdate=October 27, 2014}}</ref>
