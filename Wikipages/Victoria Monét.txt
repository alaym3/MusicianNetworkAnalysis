==Career==

===2010–2015: Songwriting and ''Nightmares & Lullabies''===
Outside of dance rehearsals, Monét began exchanging poetry with an older cousin and found a new passion. This soon translated into her writing her own music. Meanwhile, she had been educating herself on the production world, learning about producers, and making music at a local recording studio. She learned about [[Rodney Jerkins]] (aka Darkchild) and decided to add him on [[Myspace]].<ref name="IGotSoul">{{cite web|last1=YKIGS|title=Interview: Victoria Monét Talks Nightmares & Lullabies Project, Working With Ariana Grande, & Signing With Atlantic Records|url=http://youknowigotsoul.com/interview-victoria-monet-talks-nightmares-lullabies-project-working-with-ariana-grande-signing-with-atlantic-records|website=YouKnowIGotSoul.com|access-date=April 13, 2015}}</ref> Shortly after that, he invited her to come to [[Los Angeles]] and audition for a new girl group he was forming, Purple Reign.<ref name="SoulTrain">{{cite journal|date=December 12, 2014|title=Profile: Victoria Monet |journal=[[Soul Train]]|url=http://soultrain.com/2014/12/12/profile-victoria-monet/}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-06-13|title=Victoria Monét on her 'Friendship-Based' Writing Success With Ariana Grande|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8515625/victoria-monet-billboard-cover-story-2019|access-date=2020-09-19|website=Billboard}}</ref> The group landed a record deal with [[Motown]] a year later, but was dropped before releasing any music.
