== Formation ==
The roots for the formation of Flatland Cavalry were first laid when Cleto Cordero and Jason Albers began playing at local venues while rooming together at [[Midland College]].<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=http://www.midlandlivingmagazine.com/2019/05/28/200570/flatland-cavalry-takes-texas-by-storm|title=Flatland Cavalry takes Texas by Storm {{!}} Midland Living|last=|first=|date=|website=Midland Living|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> The two had been jamming together since junior high but it was not until they moved to Lubbock in 2012 that the band began to take shape. It was here, while studying at [[Texas Tech University]], that the duo met Laura Jane at a house party. Jonathan Saenz and Reid Dillon joined the rest in 2014 and the band's lineup was complete.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":0" />

Cordero himself began playing the guitar at age 14 and wrote his first song by the time he was 17 years old for Lee High School's Rebel Lee Court Awards Ceremony.<ref name=":5" /> He writes most of the band's songs apart from playing the role of lead guitarist and singer with Jason Albers on drums, Jonathan Saenz on bass, Reid Dillon on guitar and Wesley Hall on violin. Hall took the place of Laura Jane when she parted ways with the band in 2018.<ref name=":1" /><ref name="koke" />
