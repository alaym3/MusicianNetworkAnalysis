'''Domingo Edjang Moreno''' (born 28 April 1977<ref>[http://www.webfamosos.com/chojin/ Web de fans de Chojin]</ref>), better known by his stage name '''El Chojin''' (pronounced as in Japanese {{Nihongo|||Chōjin}}, not with a [[voiceless velar fricative|Spanish ''J'']]), is a Spanish rapper and songwriter. He is the current [[Guinness World Record]] holder for most syllables rapped in one minute.<ref>http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records/arts_and_media/music_feats_and_facts/fastest_rap_mc.aspx</ref>

== Early life ==
Chojin was born in [[Torrejón de Ardoz]], Madrid, to a father from [[Equatorial Guinea]] and an [[Extremadura]]n (Spanish) mother.

==Career==
El Chojin takes his name from the Overfiend in the [[hentai]] [[anime]] ''[[Urotsukidōji]]''. During the first part of his rap career, he was a member of the WFN crew ("Wild for da Night"), so called after a [[Rampage (rapper)|Rampage]]/[[Busta Rhymes]] song of the same name.<ref>[http://www.hhdirecto.net/entrevistas/chojin.php Hip Hop Directo interview]</ref> He was later part of the group 995 and with them released four albums.

As a solo artist he has put out twelve LPs as of 2013, including ''Cuando Hay Obstáculos...'' and ''...Jamás Intentes Negarlo'' (the initials of those two titles spelling out C.H.O.J.I.N.). After his first five full-length solo records, in 2004 Chojin returned with a demo, ''Rap por placer'', available as a free download.

In early 2005, his eighth [[LP album|LP]] ''8jin'' was released. The record tackles such issues as professionalism in rap and violence against women. The album cover was chosen from among almost 400 submissions, from a contest organized by the rapper through his webpage.

In 2007 he released ''Striptease'', an album in which he "bares" his soul. It is a collaboration with various producers, both veteran and new, and includes instrumentation such as guitars, harmonicas, pianos, and a [[gospel music|gospel]] chorus. The following year he released ''Aún rap por placer'', a follow-up to his previous demo, consisting of six solo tracks and one featuring [[Duo Kie]]. Like its predecessor, it could also be legally downloaded for free.

In March 2009, he released ''Cosas que pasan, que no pasan y que deberían pasar'' (''Things that Happen, Don't Happen, and Should Happen''), a 30-track album with a diverse array of contributors, including Locus from Duo Kie, Maika Sitté from [[blues]] band Red House, comedian [[El Gran Wyoming]], and singer-songwriter [[Luis Eduardo Aute]], as well as others.

Chojin is known for the social commentary of his lyrics, his solo record ''Mi turno'' being perhaps his most "radical" work. He avoids coarse language in his music, and his raps also frequently espouse [[non-violence]], [[anti-racism]], and warn of the dangers of [[narcotics|drugs]] and alcohol. One of the main themes covered on most albums is the discrimination against and general mistreatment of immigrants. Although, being born and raised in Spain, he is not an immigrant himself, he is well aware of the problems they face. As is reflected in his songs "Yo no soy de esos", "Mami, el negro está rabioso", and "Cara sucia", he has suffered such discrimination due to the colour of his skin. He also is known for his track "Lola", promoting condom use, which came to be used in a [[Barcelona]] contraceptive awareness campaign. [[Amnesty International]] used one of his songs (featuring [[Meko]] and [[Kraze Negroze]]) for their "Ponte en mi piel" ("Put Yourself in My Skin") campaign, another attempt to raise awareness, this time regarding immigration, and, with the release of ''8jin'', Amnesty selected "El final del cuento de hadas" ("The End of the Fairy Tale") for a campaign against [[gender-based violence]].

In addition to lyrics, Chojin has also written poetry and various articles. In 2007, he wrote and starred in ''El alma de Alexander Oboe'' (''The Soul of Alexander Oboe''), a [[stage play|play]] produced by Casa de los Pueblos, which debuted at the Festival Madrid Sur and went on to tour various theatres in Spain. While finishing and preparing for the launch of his first book, ''98 rimas y 7 leyendas'' (''98 Rhymes and 7 Legends''), he has collaborated on [[movie soundtrack]]s such as ''Tánger'' and created what he calls "the first [[rap opera]] in Spanish", entitled ''Rimas para todos los públicos'' (''Rhymes for All Audiences'').

Since 28 January 2010, El Chojin has appeared every Wednesday on [[TVE2|Noticias 2]], performing a rap summarizing the week's news.

=== World record ===
On 23 December 2008, El Chojin appeared on [[Telecinco]] in an attempt to break Rebel XD's record, but failed to rap more than 852 syllables within 42.2 seconds. El Chojin did however create his own separate record from Rebel XD, where he took 1 minute to rap 921 syllables, which came out to be 15 syllables per second on his song titled "Vo-ca-li-za". Rebel XD rapped 20 syllables per second.

As of January 2015, no one has beaten the 852 syllables in 42 seconds record, or the 921 in 60 seconds record, except [[Outsider (rapper)|Outsider]] whose attempt did surpass El Chojin by 2 syllables per second but wasn't accepted because he rapped in Korean.
