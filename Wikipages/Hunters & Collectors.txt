'''Hunters & Collectors''' are an Australian rock band formed in 1981. Fronted by founding mainstay, singer-songwriter and guitarist [[Mark Seymour]], they developed a blend of [[Pub rock (Australia)|pub rock]] and [[funk|art-funk]]. Other mainstays are John Archer on bass guitar, Doug Falconer on drums and percussion. Soon after forming they were joined by Jack Howard on trumpet and keyboards, [[Jeremy Smith (Australian musician)|Jeremy Smith]] on [[French horn]], guitars and keyboards, and Michael Waters on [[trombone]] and keyboards. Also acknowledged as a founder was [[audio engineering|engineer]] and [[art director|art designer]] Robert Miles. Joining in 1988, [[Barry Palmer (musician)|Barry Palmer]], on lead guitar, remained until they disbanded in 1998. The group reformed in 2013 with the 1998 line-up.

Originally Hunters & Collectors were influenced by [[Krautrock]] and productions of [[Conny Plank]], featuring strong percussive influences, noisy guitar, and driving [[bass line]]s. Their sound was in the vein of the [[Talking Heads]] album, ''[[Remain in Light]]'' (1980). Hunters & Collectors used Plank to produce two of their early albums, ''[[The Fireman's Curse]]'' (1983) and ''[[The Jaws of Life]]'' (1984), but neither charted into the Top&nbsp;50 of the Australian [[Kent Music Report]] Albums Chart. Their first Top&nbsp;10 album, ''[[Human Frailty]]'' (1986), also featured their logo, a H & C symbol, where the "&" consists of twin snakes entwined around a [[hunting knife]], a variation of a [[caduceus]].

Later Top&nbsp;10 studio albums were ''[[Ghost Nation (album)|Ghost Nation]]'' (1989), ''[[Cut (Hunters and Collectors album)|Cut]]'' (1992), and ''[[Demon Flower]]'' (1994). Their hit singles were "Talking to a Stranger" (1982), "[[Throw Your Arms Around Me]]" (1984), "[[Say Goodbye (Hunters & Collectors song)|Say Goodbye]]" (1986), "When the River Runs Dry" (1989), "True Tears of Joy" (1992), and "[[Holy Grail (Hunters & Collectors song)|Holy Grail]]" (1993). They became one of the best live acts in Australia and according to [[musicologist]], [[Ian McFarlane]], their "great achievement was to lay bare human emotions in the intensely ritualistic milieu of the pub-rock gig".

==History==
===1978–1980: Formation===
Hunters & Collectors' founding mainstays are John Archer (bass guitar), Doug Falconer (drums) and [[Mark Seymour]] (guitar and lead vocals).<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="Nimmervoll"/> They met as residential students of [[Ormond College (University of Melbourne)|Ormond College]] at the [[University of Melbourne]] in the late 1970s.<ref name="Thirteen"/> Seymour is the older brother of [[Nick Seymour]], the bass guitarist for [[Crowded House]].<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Nimmervoll"/> In 1978 with Robert Miles ([[audio engineering|sound engineer]]) Archer, Falconer and Seymour formed a casual band, The Schnorts (named after a Belgian tennis racket).<ref name="Thirteen"/>[[File:The Schnortocaster.JPG|thumb|The electric tennis racquet used by The Schnorts.]] They played cover versions of 1960s songs, including "[[To Sir, with Love (song)|To Sir, with Love]]".<ref name="Thirteen"/><ref name="Webb"/> Their lead singer, [[Margot O'Neill]], was a journalist on radio [[3RRR]] program, ''Talking Headlines''.<ref name="Thirteen"/>

A more ambitious band, The Jetsonnes, followed in September 1979, with the addition of Ray Tosti-Gueira on guitar and backing vocals.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> According to music journalist, [[Clinton Walker]], The Jetsonnes had a "clever post-punk pop sound" which "was lighter, bouncier (rather than funkier) and more infectious than other like-minded bands".<ref name="McFarlane"/> Their only released track is "Newspaper" which was one side of a gig give away [[split album|split single]] in June 1980 with "Miniskirts in Moscow" by fellow pop group, International Exiles, as the other.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Thirteen"/><ref name="Inner"/> By September that year The Jetsonnes had disbanded but Archer, Falconer, Miles, Seymour and Tosti-Gueira decided to continue with new members, Geoff Crosby on keyboards and Greg Perano (ex-True Wheels) on percussion to form a new band.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="Thirteen"/>

===1981–1983: ''World of Stone'' to ''The Fireman's Curse''===
Hunters & Collectors formed in Melbourne in early 1981 with the initial line-up of Archer, Crosby, Falconer, Miles, Perano, Seymour and Tosti-Gueira.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> Miles was credited as an equal part of the band's output and stayed throughout their main career.<ref name="McFarlane"/> Perano provided the band's name from "Hunters and Collectors", a track on 1975's ''[[Landed (album)|Landed]]'' album by German group [[Can (band)|Can]].<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Nimmervoll"/> Australian musicologist, [[Ian McFarlane]], compared the new band with The Jetsonnes and found it to be "a far more radical and unremitting concept".<ref name="McFarlane"/>

Originally Hunters & Collectors were influenced by the [[Krautrock]] genre and the productions of [[Conny Plank]], featuring strong percussive influences, noisy guitar, and driving bass lines.<ref name="McFarlane"/> As lead singer and guitarist, Seymour became the principal lyricist and the linchpin of the group.<ref name="Nimmervoll"/> The core of Hunters & Collectors was expanded by a brass section, later dubbed Horns of Contempt, consisting of Nigel Crocker and Michael Waters both on [[trombone]]; Jack Howard, Andy Lynn and Chris Malherbe each on trumpet; and [[Jeremy Smith (Australian musician)|Jeremy Smith]] on [[French horn]].<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/>

[[Mushroom Records]] specifically formed a new [[Alternative music|alternative]] label, White Label Records, when they signed Hunters & Collectors.<ref name="McFarlane"/> Their first release was ''[[World of Stone (EP)|World of Stone]]'', a three-track 12" extended play in January 1982.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> It reached the top&nbsp;50 on the Australian [[Kent Music Report]] Singles Chart.<ref name="Kent"/> Their debut [[Hunters & Collectors (album)|self-titled album]] followed in July and was produced by the band and engineered by Sydney-based [[Tony Cohen]].<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> It peaked at No.&nbsp;21 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart,<ref name="Kent"/> and No.&nbsp;14 on the [[Recording Industry Association of New Zealand|New Zealand Albums Chart]].<ref name="NZ Charts"/> The album's lead single, "Talking to a Stranger", also released in July, was accompanied by a music video directed by film maker [[Richard Lowenstein]],<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Hutchence"/><ref name="Rowe"/> but it did not enter the Top&nbsp;50.<ref name="Kent"/> By that time, Tosti-Gueira was replaced by Martin Lubran (ex-Spiny Norman) on guitar and the Horns of Contempt were reduced to three: Howard, Smith and Waters.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/>

Another EP, ''[[Payload (EP)|Payload]]'', was released in November, its four tracks were co-produced by [[Mike Howlett]] (ex-[[Gong (band)|Gong]]) and the band.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> The EP peaked at No.&nbsp;31 on the New Zealand Singles Chart.<ref name="NZ Charts"/> Lowenstein also directed the music video for the lead single, "Lumps of Lead",<ref name="Hutchence"/><ref name="Rowe"/> but it did not chart in Australia or New Zealand.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="NZ Charts"/> In 1983 the band toured the United Kingdom for six months and signed with [[Virgin Records]].<ref name="McFarlane"/> The label recompiled three tracks from the Australian version of ''Hunters & Collectors'' and all four tracks from ''Payload'' into the international version of ''Hunters & Collectors'', which was released in April.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Thirteen"/> While in the UK and attempting to enter the local market, the group's members "were doing odd jobs, illegally, to keep afloat and getting steadily more miserable in the process".<ref name="Export"/>

By mid-year the band had decamped to Conny's Studio in Germany, where they recorded their second album, ''[[The Fireman's Curse]]'', co-produced by Plank (Can, [[Cluster (band)|Cluster]], [[Kraftwerk]]), with Dave Hutchins engineering, and released by White Label and Virgin Records on 5 September 1983.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> McFarlane felt it was "overly ambitious and cluttered, and generally suffered from a lack of fresh ideas".<ref name="McFarlane"/> The album did not reach the top&nbsp;50 in Australia but did so in New Zealand.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="NZ Charts"/> A three-record deal with Virgin was broken when band members insulted the label's executive, Simon Draper, by telling him that he was "a [[wikt:ponce|poncy]] little [[Nobility#"Blue" blood|blueblood]]" with no faith in them.<ref name="Thirteen"/><ref name="Webb"/> Its lead single, "Judas Sheep" (August), reached the top&nbsp;40 in New Zealand but did not chart in Australia.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="NZ Charts"/> After November's single, "Sway", failed to chart in both markets,<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="NZ Charts"/> they disbanded briefly.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Thirteen"/>

===1984–1986: ''The Jaws of Life'' to ''Human Frailty'' ===
Late in 1983, Hunters & Collectors had briefly disbanded, but soon reformed without Lubran and Perano.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> Seymour explained to ''[[The Canberra Times]]''{{'}} Neil Lade why the group had reconvened "[we] have something valuable to offer the Australian music scene".<ref name="Lade"/> The 1984 line-up now featured greater use of keyboards by Crosby, as well as more emphasis on work by Howard, Smith and Waters.<ref name="McFarlane"/> The band began to pare back the [[art rock]] elements of their earliest albums, although they retained a muscular, bass-driven sound, rounded off by the band's distinctive horn section. Seymour's lyrics became less abstruse and focused on the twin themes of the fraught personal relationships and the politics of the day.<ref name="Nimmervoll"/>

The first album featuring the new line up was ''[[The Jaws of Life]]'' which appeared on 6 August 1984.<ref name="McFarlane"/> McFarlane described it as having "a stripped-down rock sound, a driving rhythm, more concise arrangements and stronger songs".<ref name="McFarlane"/> While [[Toby Creswell]] writing for ''[[Rolling Stone Australia|Rolling Stone]]'' felt its "aesthetic push ranged from the barrenness and isolation of outback Australia to the beer-swilling machismo of the suburbs".<ref name="McFarlane"/> The album reached the top&nbsp;100 in Australia and top&nbsp;40 in New Zealand.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="NZ Charts"/> Again co-produced with Plank,<ref name="Holmgren"/> it was recorded at the old Can studio by [[René Tinner]]. The title, cover art and opening track, "42 Wheels", all refer to the murder of five people by an intoxicated, outback trucker, [[Douglas Crabbe]].<ref name="Thirteen"/>

''The Jaws of Life'' provided a single, "The Slab" (also in August), which did not chart.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Kent"/> However relentless touring, airplay on radio station [[Triple J]] plus their music videos screening on ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'' and other music video shows, fostered a devoted following on the [[Pub rock (Australia)|pub rock]] scene. In November they issued the first version of "[[Throw Your Arms Around Me]]" as a single-only, it had no chart success in Australia but reached No.&nbsp;28 in New Zealand in the following March.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Kent"/><ref name="NZ Charts"/>

On 24 and 25 August 1984 Hunters & Collectors performed two gigs at The Venue in Melbourne, the performances were recorded and filmed. For the gigs Smith and Waters also played organs.<ref name="Relph"/> The band issued their first live album, ''The Way to Go Out'',<ref name="McFarlane"/> on 1 April 1985, which was recorded and mixed live by Miles.<ref name="Relph"/> A month later the group released their first video album, on [[VHS]], of the same name, which also included three previously aired music videos, "Talking to a Stranger", "Lumps of Lead", and "Judas Sheep".<ref name="Relph"/> The live album reached the top&nbsp;100 in Australia and No.&nbsp;21 in New Zealand.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="NZ Charts"/> It "captured all the ferocious power and muscular energy that characterised the band's pub gigs" according to McFarlane.<ref name="McFarlane"/> A live version of "Throw Your Arms Around Me" also appeared on the album and VHS. Crosby left after ''The Way to Go Out'' was released and Waters took over on keyboards.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/>

Greater Australian commercial success came in April 1986, with their fourth studio album, ''[[Human Frailty]]'', which McFarlane found was "a further refinement of the sinewy and dynamic approach established" previously.<ref name="McFarlane"/> It was co-produced by the group with Gavin MacKillop.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> Australian music journalist, [[Ed Nimmervoll]], noted "Seymour's themes of alienation and sexual politics came to the fore" with the album.<ref name="Nimmervoll"/> It became their first Australian Top&nbsp;Ten album and reached No.&nbsp;5 in New Zealand.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="NZ Charts"/> In 2008 ''Human Frailty'', was featured by [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] TV on the ''Great Australian Albums'' second series. Creswell presented the series and noted that "the album documents, in the most candid terms, the course of a doomed love affair that [Seymour] was then going through. A parallel narrative is also running through the album, which is of a group adjusting to life on the road and an exploration of what it means to be Australian in the 1980s".<ref name="Creswell"/>

"[[Say Goodbye (Hunters & Collectors song)|Say Goodbye]]", the lead single, was issued ahead of the album in February and peaked at No.&nbsp;24 in Australia and No.&nbsp;20 in New Zealand.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="NZ Charts"/> The single's back cover art includes their logo, a H & C symbol, where the "&" is stylised with twin snakes entwined around a [[hunting knife]], a variation of a [[caduceus]]. Nimmervoll described how the group "had discovered how to tap the unique vein they had unearthed; where, in a sweat-dripping venue packed to the rafters with a beer swilling macho rock fans the audience would and could at the top of their voices unselfconsciously sing along to a chorus like 'you don't make me feel like a woman any more'".<ref name="Nimmervoll"/> The chorus appears in "Say Goodbye" and Pollyanna Sutton of ''[[The Canberra Times]]'' felt that Seymour had written "a line which he could sing in a pub with a lot of vulgarity that would get both guys and girls singing".<ref name="Sutton"/>

A third version of "Throw Your Arms Around Me" was recorded for the album and was issued as its second single, which peaked at No.&nbsp;49 in Australia in May 1986.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="NZ Charts"/> Eventually it became one of their most popular songs, voted in the Top&nbsp;5 on the Triple J [[Hottest 100]] for 1989, 1990, and 1991.<ref name="AutoYQ-1"/> Two further singles from ''Human Frailty'' were released, "[[Everything's on Fire]]" (August 1986) and "Is There Anybody in There?" (October), both reached the top&nbsp;50 in New Zealand but not in Australia.<ref name="Kent"/> The band had signed a parallel deal with [[I.R.S. Records]] for North America, which released the album there in July 1987.<ref name="Thirteen"/>

===1987–1991: ''Living Daylight'' to ''Collected Works'' ===
After ''Human Frailty'' appeared in Australia Hunters & Collectors toured the US twice and then released their third EP, ''[[Living Daylight]]''.<ref name="McFarlane"/> It was co-produced with Greg Edward and released in Australia in April 1987.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> McFarlane felt it was "something of a stop-gap measure".<ref name="McFarlane"/> The three-track EP appeared on the Australian Top&nbsp;50 Singles Chart and reached No.&nbsp;25 in New Zealand.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="NZ Charts"/> It was followed by their fifth studio album, ''[[What's a Few Men?]]'', also co-produced with Edward and released in November. It peaked at No.&nbsp;16 in Australia and No.&nbsp;9 in New Zealand.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="NZ Charts"/>

The album provided the singles "Do You See What I See" (October) and "Still Hangin' Round" (February 1988).<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Relph"/> "Do You See What I See" reached the top&nbsp;40 in Australia and in New Zealand it became their highest charting single at No.&nbsp;13.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="NZ Charts"/> "Still Hangin' Round" was deemed to be too "Australian": it was cut from the US configuration of the album, which was retitled ''Fate'', and released in September 1988.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Relph"/> Three new tracks were recorded for the US CD version, including "Back on the Breadline", which was issued as a single and charted at No.&nbsp;6 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Modern Rock Tracks|Modern Rock Tracks]].<ref name="AMGSingles"/> In August 2003 a re-issue of ''What's a Few Men?'' by the [[Liberation Music|Liberation Blue]] label featured all 15 tracks from the two versions.<ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="Relph"/>

Early in 1988 Barry Palmer (also a member of Harem Scarem<!-- Melbourne band (1982–89), not Canadian (1987–2008) nor Scottish (2003–2009?) one -->, ex-[[Stephen Cummings]] Band) joined the group on guitar.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> ''[[Ghost Nation (album)|Ghost Nation]]'', co-produced with Clive Martin<ref name="Holmgren"/> and released in November 1989, was their second Australian Top&nbsp;Ten, it appeared on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Albums Chart]].<ref name="AusCharts"/> In New Zealand it reached the top&nbsp;30 and also charted in Sweden reaching No.&nbsp;31 on the [[Sverigetopplistan]].<ref name="NZ Charts"/><ref name="SWECharts"/> McFarlane enthused "[it] was perhaps the band's finest album to date".<ref name="McFarlane"/> However [[Allmusic]]'s Mike DeGagne declared that it was "one of this Australian band's weakest attempts, [it] suffers greatly from bland lyrics and gray instrumental work through the entirety of the album".<ref name="DeGagne"/> It provided four singles, beginning with "When the River Runs Dry", appearing in September and peaking at No.&nbsp;23 in Australia in December and No.&nbsp;5 on ''Billboard'' Modern Rock Tracks in 1990.<ref name="AMGSingles"/><ref name="AusCharts"/>

Hunters & Collectors supported [[Midnight Oil]]'s North American tour of 1990 and, although the band struggled to find further chart success in the US, they maintained their status in Australia and New Zealand as local favourites. During that year [[Rolling Stone Australia|''Rolling Stone'' (Australia)]] named them Australian Band of the Year.<ref name="McFarlane"/> Contemporary singer-songwriter, [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]], recalled that by the late 1980s the band "were peaking in the pubs, gathering an army ... [the group] had a big, fat industrial bass sound, an anthemic horn section, and their singlet-clad singer [Seymour], as fit as a trout, held nothing back".<ref name="Kelly"/>

At the [[ARIA Music Awards of 1990]] the group were nominated in six categories and ''Ghost Nation'' won Best Cover Art for Miles' work.<ref name="ARIA1990"/> A compilation album, ''[[Collected Works (Hunters & Collectors album)|Collected Works]]'', was released on 19 November 1990, and was another Top Ten album in Australia.<ref name="AusCharts"/> It contained a fourth version of "Throw Your Arms Around Me" which was released as a single for a third time by December that year.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="AusCharts"/> It peaked at No.&nbsp;34 in Australia – the highest position of all three versions.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="AusCharts"/> Another single, "Where Do You Go", which was co-produced by [[Nick Sansano]] and issued in late 1991, also reached the Top&nbsp;40.<ref name="AusCharts"/>

===1992–1998: ''Cut'' to ''Under One Roof''===
On 6 October 1992 Hunters & Collectors released their seventh studio album, ''[[Cut (Hunters and Collectors album)|Cut]]'', co-produced by [[Don Gehman]] ([[Jimmy Barnes]]), Sansano and the band.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> Although relationships were strained due to Gehman's aggressive working methods, the band almost broke up during recording sessions,<ref name="Jenkins"/> ''Cut'' peaked at No.&nbsp;6 in Australia and No.&nbsp;17 in New Zealand.<ref name="NZ Charts"/><ref name="AusCharts"/> It retained a balance between the band's artistic core and its commercial ambitions.<ref name="Webb"/>

The album provided six singles, all charted on the ARIA Singles Chart Top&nbsp;100.<ref name="AusCharts"/> The fourth one, "True Tears of Joy" from January 1993, peaked at No.&nbsp;14 in Australia to become their highest charting single.<ref name="AusCharts"/> It was followed by the anthemic single, "[[Holy Grail (Hunters & Collectors song)|Holy Grail]]".<ref name="Webb"/> Seymour wrote the track, with Smith, after he had read a novel by [[Jeanette Winterson]], ''The Passion'' (1987), detailing [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s march to Russia in 1812.<ref name="Jenkins"/> Seymour's lyrics also reflect the band's own flagging attempts to "crack" the American market and their recent "internal tension" while recording ''Cut''.<ref name="Jenkins"/> "I wanted to write a song to serve up this idea that regardless of what happens you've got to stay true to the quest".<ref name="Jenkins"/> The song is often heard in context with the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL), and was [[Network Ten|Channel 10]]'s theme song for their AFL TV coverage from 2002 to 2006, it was sung by Seymour at the 2002 AFL Grand Final, although he doesn't follow the game.<ref name="Thirteen"/>

''[[Demon Flower]]'', their eighth studio album, followed on 16 May 1994, which was co-produced with Nick Mainsbridge ([[The Triffids]], [[Martha's Vineyard (band)|Martha's Vineyard]], [[Ratcat]]).<ref name="Holmgren"/> McFarlane noticed that it "featured a stronger emphasis on guitars".<ref name="McFarlane"/> It peaked at No.&nbsp;2 in Australia – their highest charting album – and No.&nbsp;9 in New Zealand.<ref name="NZ Charts"/><ref name="AusCharts"/> ''Demon Flower'' provided "Easy", which reached the top&nbsp;40 in both countries, and three other singles, which did not chart.<ref name="NZ Charts"/><ref name="AusCharts"/> ''Demon Flower'' was dominated by themes relating to the politics in the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], particularly the [[economic rationalism|economic rationalist]] policies of Premier [[Jeff Kennett]].

A double live album, ''Living ... In Large Rooms and Lounges'', was released in November 1995, with one disc consisting of an acoustic set at the now-defunct Continental Cafe in [[Prahran, Victoria|Prahran]], and the other was a typical pub performance. ''[[Juggernaut (Hunters & Collectors album)|Juggernaut]]'', their ninth studio album, was co-produced with [[Kalju Tonuma]] ([[The Mavis's]], [[Boom Crash Opera]]) and [[Mark Opitz]] ([[Hoodoo Gurus]], Jimmy Barnes, [[INXS]]).<ref name="Holmgren"/> The album was recorded in 1997 and released in January 1998, and featured the single "True Believers". With its release, Hunters & Collectors announced that they would disband after the Juggernaut Say Goodbye tour.<ref name="McFarlane"/>

Hunters & Collectors embarked on their final tour of Australia in 1998, with a concert performed at Selina's, [[Coogee, New South Wales|Coogee Bay]] Hotel, Sydney being recorded and released on CD and DVD as ''[[Under One Roof (album)|Under One Roof]]''.<ref name="McFarlane"/> The group's last public show was on 22 March 1998 in Melbourne.<ref name="McFarlane"/> According to rock historian, Ian McFarlane, their "great achievement was to lay bare human emotions in the intensely ritualistic milieu of the pub-rock gig".<ref name="McFarlane"/>

In March 2009 Seymour told Patrick Donovan of ''[[The Age]]'' "It was a pretty serious decision to retire, and all the guys in the band are heavyweight professionals in their respective areas of employment. Obviously we have to put ourselves first. There's just no momentum in the idea (of reforming)".<ref name="Donovan"/>

===1999–current: Post-breakup===
After leaving Hunters & Collectors Tosti-Gueira was in Soldiers of Fortune.<ref name="Holmgren"/> Lubran has worked for numerous artists including Permanent Press, The Dying People, Apocalypse, Connection, Great Temptation, Red=Yellow=Blue, The Index, The Possum Hunters, [[Slaughtermen (band)|The Slaughtermen]] (1989), Mercy Mercy, [[Dave Graney]] and The White Buffalos (1989–90), The Trailblazers, Truckasaurus (1993), and George Huxley's International Velvet.<ref name="Holmgren"/> Perano has been a member of Pierre's World, Swell Maps, Big Choir, Love Rodeo (1984–85), The Deadly Hume (1985–88), Funkicide, and [[Kylie Minogue]] Band (1990).<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/>

Back in August 1995, while still a member of Hunters & Collectors, Palmer formed a side project, [[Deadstar]], with [[Peter Jones (drummer)|Peter Jones]] (of Crowded House) on drums and percussion; and [[Caroline Kennedy-McCracken|Caroline Kennedy]] on lead vocals and guitar.<ref name="McFarlane Deadstar"/> In 1996 Seymour undertook a solo tour and, with Palmer producing, he started recording his debut solo album, ''[[King Without a Clue]]'', which was issued in October 1997.<ref name="McFarlane"/> Deadstar members Palmer, Jones, and Kennedy had been joined by Seymour's brother, Nick in November 1996; all were used on Seymour's album.<ref name="McFarlane Deadstar"/> Subsequent to Hunters & Collector's disbandment in 1998, Seymour and Howard have each pursued solo musical careers. After Deadstar disbanded in 2001 Palmer became a producer-songwriter and was the subject of a 2005 reality TV series, ''The Hit Game''.

"Throw Your Arms Around Me" has been covered by many artists including Crowded House, [[Pearl Jam]], [[Luka Bloom]], and the [[Doug Anthony All Stars]] (and subsequently by member [[Paul McDermott (comedian)|Paul McDermott]]).<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="APRA Throw"/> In May 2001 it was recognised by the [[Australasian Performing Right Association]] (APRA) as one of the [[APRA Top 30 Australian songs|Top 30 Australian songs]] of all time.<ref name="AutoYQ-4"/> In 2009 the track was listed at No.&nbsp;23 in [[Triple J Hottest 100 of All Time, 2009|Triple J's Hottest 100 of All Time]].<ref name="AutoYQ-1"/>

On 14 July 2005 Hunters & Collectors were inducted into the [[ARIA Hall of Fame]] at the Plaza Ballroom alongside [[Split Enz]], [[Renée Geyer]], [[Normie Rowe]], [[Smoky Dawson]], and [[The Easybeats]].<ref name="ARIAHoF"/><ref name="ARIAAwards"/><ref name="ARIA2005"/> They were inducted into the Hall of Fame by [[Peter Garrett]], former lead singer of tour mates, Midnight Oil,<ref name="AutoYQ-5"/> At the ceremony Hunters & Collectors provided a one-off performance of "Say Goodbye" and "Throw Your Arms Around Me".<ref name="AutoYQ-6"/>

In 2008 Seymour published his memoirs, ''Thirteen Tonne Theory: Life Inside Hunters and Collectors'', detailing his experiences with the group.<ref name="Thirteen"/> He described the difficulty in writing tracks for the band with all members involved, "the thing that ultimately made things more difficult was the sheer size of the band".<ref name="Donovan"/>

In his autobiography ''Small Moments of Glory'' ([[Brolga Publishing]], 2020), Jack Howard wrote, "In 2008, a special and wonderfully-packaged box set, in the form of a cabinet of architectural drawers, of all our recordings had been released".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Pepper|first=Karen|date=2020-09-17|title=Literary Scene: Jack Howard - Small moments of glory|url=https://whatsmyscene.com/book-review-jack-howard/|access-date=2021-06-09|website=What's My Scene|language=en-AU}}</ref> Titled ''Horn of Plenty'' ([[Liberation Records]]), the box set included 14 CDs and 2 DVDs; Noel Mengel of ''The News'' described it as the "best box set" of the year.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2008-12-14|title=Year's best albums leave an impression|url=https://www.news.com.au/news/albums-leave-an-impression/news-story/285857c39c69b64dbb21849d0be9e345|access-date=2021-06-09|website=NewsComAu|language=en}}</ref>

Hunters & Collectors played at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] on 14 March 2009 for [[Sound Relief]], which was a multi-venue rock music concert in support of victims of the [[February 2009 Victorian bushfires|Victorian Bushfire Crisis]].<ref name="Brumby"/><ref name="Mitchell"/> The event was held simultaneously with a concert at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]].<ref name="Brumby"/> All the proceeds from the Melbourne Concert went to the [[Red Cross]] Victorian Bushfire relief.<ref name="Brumby"/><ref name="Mitchell"/> Appearing with Hunters & Collectors in Melbourne were, [[Augie March]], Bliss N Eso with Paris Wells, [[Gabriella Cilmi]], [[Kasey Chambers]] & Shane Nicholson with [[Troy Cassar-Daley]], [[Jack Johnson (musician)|Jack Johnson]], [[Jet (band)|Jet]], [[Kings of Leon]], [[Liam Finn]] (joined on stage with Crowded House), Midnight Oil, Paul Kelly, Split Enz and [[Wolfmother]].<ref name="Official"/>

Seymour expressed the group's motivation "This event is not about Hunters & Collectors ... It's about contributing to the groundswell of generosity that has emerged in the community after the cataclysm that's been inflicted on people simply because of where they live. It's a very big Australian story and it's got a cultural dimension. It's a huge honour to be part of it".<ref name="Donovan"/> Hunters & Collectors performed a selection of their most popular songs over a 40-minute set, including an encore performance of "The Slab". The Sound Relief concert, including the Hunters & Collectors set, was broadcast on Australian cable TV and FM radio, which was released on DVD.

A tribute album, ''Crucible – The Songs of Hunters & Collectors'', was released in September 2013, including contributions by [[Birds of Tokyo]], [[Eddie Vedder]] and [[Neil Finn]] (of Crowded House), [[Cloud Control]], [[Something for Kate]], and [[The Rubens]], as well as a remix of the original "Talking to a Stranger" by [[The Avalanches]].<ref name="AutoYQ-7"/>

The band reunited in their 1998 line-up of Archer, Falconer, Howard, Palmer, Seymour, Smith and Waters, at the [[2013 AFL Grand Final]] playing "Do You See What I See" and "The Holy Grail".<ref name="Cashmere"/> They headlined a series of A Day on the Green outdoor concerts in early 2014, and supported [[Bruce Springsteen]] and the E Street Band during their tour of Australia on 15 and 16 February 2014 at [[Melbourne Rectangular Stadium]].<ref name="Cashmere"/><ref name="AutoYQ-9"/><ref name="AutoYQ-10"/> Paul Busch of ToneDeaf website caught their gig on 4 April at the [[Enmore Theatre]] in Sydney: "Seymour was in fine vocal form and the sound, although a bit too loud to start with, settled down ... The joy could also be seen in the energy of the band".<ref name="Busch"/> On 12 April 2014 they performed their last concert for the reunion series at the [[Palais Theatre]] in [[St Kilda, Victoria|St. Kilda]].<ref name="AutoYQ-10"/><ref name="Mercury"/> The band subsequently won the 2014 [[Helpmann Awards|Helpmann Award]] for Best Australian Contemporary Concert.

In November 2017, ''Cut'', the band's 7th album was given a 25th anniversary release with a bonus disc of "offcuts", "precuts"  and "postcuts".

The band were scheduled to reunite again to headline the Red Hot Summer Tour across Australia in early 2020, accompanied by [[James Reyne]], [[The Living End]], [[The Angels (Australian band)|The Angels]], [[Baby Animals]], [[Killing Heidi]] and [[Boom Crash Opera]]. The first date of the tour is 4 January 2020 in [[Bendigo]] and concludes 26 April 2020 in [[Noosa]].<ref name="RedHot2020" />
