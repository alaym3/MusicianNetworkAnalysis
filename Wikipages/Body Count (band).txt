'''Body Count''' is an American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band formed in Los Angeles in 1990. The group is fronted by [[Ice-T]], who first established himself as a [[rap music|rapper]] but co-founded the group with lead guitarist [[Ernie C]] out of their interest in heavy metal music. Ice-T took on the role of vocalist and writing the lyrics for most of Body Count's songs, while Ernie C has been responsible for writing the group's music.

Body Count's [[Body Count (album)|self-titled debut album]] was released on [[Sire Records]] in 1992, and garnered much attention due to a controversy around the song "[[Cop Killer (song)|Cop Killer]]". Their label, Sire Records, and their parent company, [[Warner Bros. Records]], defended the song; however Ice-T chose to remove it from the album because he felt that the controversy had eclipsed the music itself. The group left Sire the following year, and they have since released six more albums.

Three out of the band's original seven members are deceased: D-Roc died from [[lymphoma]], [[Victor Ray Wilson|Beatmaster V]] from [[leukemia]] and [[Mooseman]] in a [[drive-by shooting]]. Body Count's current lineup includes vocalist Ice-T, guitarists Ernie C and [[Juan Garcia (guitarist)|Juan Garcia]], bassist Vincent Price, drummer Will "Ill Will" Dorsey Jr., and backing vocalists Sean E Sean and Little Ice, the latter of whom is Ice-T's son.

The band received their second Grammy nomination and later won the award at the [[63rd Annual Grammy Awards]] in 2021 for [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance|Best Metal Performance]] with their song "Bum Rush" from the album ''[[Carnivore (Body Count album)|Carnivore]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Rachael|first=Dowd|title=BODY COUNT WIN BEST METAL PERFORMANCE AT THE 2021 GRAMMY AWARDS|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/body-count-wins-best-metal-performance-2021-grammys|website=[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]|date=March 14, 2021|access-date=March 14, 2021}}</ref>

==History==
===Pre-formation (1990–1991)===
[[Ice-T]]'s interest in [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] stemmed from sharing a room with his cousin Earl, who was a fan of [[rock music]] and only listened to the local rock stations. Ice-T particularly enjoyed heavy metal, citing [[Edgar Winter]], [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Black Sabbath]] as his favorite bands.<ref name=IceCentury-127/> Ice-T attended [[Crenshaw High School]], where a few classmates shared his interest in the genre, including musicians [[Ernie C]], D-Roc the Executioner, [[Beatmaster V]], and [[Mooseman]]. Ice-T began a solo career as a rapper, and later decided to form Body Count with these friends.<ref name=IceCentury-127/><ref name="AllMusic">{{Cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=Body Count {{!}} Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/body-count-mn0000078191/biography|access-date=March 14, 2021|website=[[AllMusic]]|language=en}}</ref>

Ice-T co-wrote the band's music and lyrics with lead guitarist Ernie C, and took on the duties of lead vocalist, even though he felt that he did not have a great singing voice.<ref name="IceOpinion">{{cite book |author1=Ice T |last2=Sigmund |first2=Heidi |title=The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a Fuck? |year=1994 |publisher=Pan Books |isbn=0-330-33629-0 |pages=99–101; 166–180 }}</ref> The original line-up consisted of D-Roc on [[rhythm guitar]], Beatmaster V on [[Drum kit|drums]] and Mooseman on [[Bass guitar|bass]].

===Touring and debut album (1991–1992) ===
Ice-T introduced the band at [[Lollapalooza]] in 1991, devoting half of his set to his hip hop songs, and half to Body Count songs, increasing his appeal with both alternative music fans and middle-class teenagers.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=Ice-T {{!}} Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/ice-t-mn0000072003/biography|access-date=March 14, 2021|website=[[AllMusic]]|language=en}}</ref> Some considered the Body Count performances to be the highlight of the tour.<ref>{{cite book |last=Apter |first=Jeff |title=Fornication: The Red Hot Chili Peppers Story |year=2004 |publisher=Omnibus Press |isbn=1-84449-381-4 |page=250 }}</ref> The group made its first album appearance on Ice-T's 1991 solo album ''[[O.G. Original Gangster]]''. The song, "Body Count", was preceded by a spoken introduction in which Ice-T responds to allegations that he had "sold out" by incorporating rock elements into his rap albums by pointing out that rock music originated with [[African-American]] artists such as [[Chuck Berry]], [[Bo Diddley]] and [[Little Richard]], in addition to stating that "as far as I'm concerned, music is music. I don't look at it as rock, [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], or all that kind of stuff. I just look at it as music. [...] I do what I like and I happen to like [[Rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]], and I feel sorry for anybody who only listens to one form of music".<ref>Ice-T (1991). "Body Count". ''O.G. Original Gangster''. [[Sire Records|Sire]]/[[Warner Bros. Records]]. {{ISBN|7-5992-6492-2}}</ref>

Body Count's [[Body Count (album)|self-titled debut album]] was released on [[Sire Records|Sire]]/[[Warner Bros. Records]] on March 31, 1992. On the strength of the album, Body Count toured internationally, developing a strong following.<ref name=IceCentury-127/> When the group performed in [[Milan]], [[Italy]], some of the [[punk subculture|punks]] in the crowd began spitting at Ernie C.<ref name=IceCentury-127/> Ice-T attempted to calm the situation by telling the crowd not to spit, but the spitting continued.<ref name=IceCentury-127/> As the band prepared to play "[[Cop Killer (song)|Cop Killer]]", Ice-T identified an audience member who spit in his direction; Ice-T responded by rushing into the crowd and punching the spitter.<ref name=IceCentury-127/> As the band began to play, some of the audience began fighting with Ice-T. Body Count escaped the crowd mid-song, and the promoter immediately shut the concert down.<ref name=IceCentury-127/>

Outside the venue, angry audience members trashed the band's tour bus. The band hailed a taxicab, but its driver abandoned the cab when the mob surrounded the taxi and shot at it, leading the promoter, representing Body Count, to steal the taxi in order to escape, abandoning it and their tour coats a mile away from the venue.<ref name=IceCentury-127/> The promoters representant was Rolf Stahlhofen, who later became the singer of the German multiplatinum selling band [[Söhne Mannheims]]. They hailed another cab, and the driver attempted to take them back to the venue until the band screamed at the driver to take them to the hotel.<ref name=IceCentury-127/> The incident was the subject of much controversy and coverage on Italian television. The band appeared on a Milan radio station, where the disc jockey told his audience, "Some clowns tried to ruin his concert. We should be angry at them. Ice-T is a guest in our country, we invited him to do all these sold-out shows, and we love him!"<ref name=IceCentury-127/> Several Italian fans apologized for the behavior of the Milan audience.<ref name=IceCentury-127/>

===Controversy over the song Cop Killer (1992)===
{{main|Body Count (album)|Cop Killer (song)}}

The song "Cop Killer", intended to criticize corrupt [[police officer]]s, encountered controversy, as it was seen as an attack against the entire police force.<ref name="IceOpinion"/><ref name="Time">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,976203,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930055333/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,976203,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 30, 2007 |title=Ice T Melts |access-date=October 9, 2007 |date=August 10, 1992 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] }}</ref> According to Ice-T, "I thought I was safe. I thought within the world of rock'n'roll, you could be free to write what you want. Hell, I was listening to [[Talking Heads]] singin' '[[Psycho Killer]]'. Fuck it, I'll make 'Cop Killer'! But, that was the cross of metal with something that was real. Now we're not just killing your family, we're killing somebody so real that everybody just went, 'oh shit'".<ref name="Escapi">{{cite web |url=http://www.escapimusic.com/eu/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=108&Itemid=31 |title=Body Count |access-date=October 9, 2007 |publisher=Escapi Music Group |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928084335/http://www.escapimusic.com/eu/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=108&Itemid=31 |archive-date=September 28, 2007}}</ref>

The Dallas Police Association and the Combined Law Enforcement Association of Texas launched a campaign to force [[Warner Records|Warner Bros. Records]] to withdraw the album.<ref name="YouthMedia">{{cite book |last=Osgerby |first=Bill |title=Youth Media |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-23808-0 |pages=68–69 }}</ref> Within a week, they were joined by police organizations across the [[United States]].<ref name="YouthMedia"/> Some critics argued that the song could cause crime and violence.<ref name="YouthMedia"/> Many defended the song on the basis of the group's right to [[freedom of speech]]. In ''The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a Fuck'', Ice-T wrote that "The people who did have a platform were way off backing me on the First Amendment. That's not where all the anger should have been directed. The anger should have been generated back at the police. [...] Because people jumped on the wrong issue they were able to drive this thing totally through Warner Brothers."<ref name="IceOpinion"/>

Over the next month, controversy against the band grew. Vice President [[Dan Quayle]] branded "Cop Killer" as being "obscene", and President [[George H. W. Bush|George H.W. Bush]] publicly denounced any record company that would release such a product.<ref name="YouthMedia"/> At a [[WarnerMedia|Time-Warner]] shareholders' meeting, actor [[Charlton Heston]] stood and read lyrics from the song "KKK Bitch" to an astonished audience and demanded that the company take action.<ref name="YouthMedia"/> The criticism escalated to the point where death threats were sent to Time-Warner executives, and [[shareholder]]s threatened to pull out of the company. Finally, Ice-T decided to remove "Cop Killer" from the album of his own volition.<ref name="IceOpinion"/><ref name="Time"/><ref name="Roc">{{cite web|url=http://www.theroc.org/roc-mag/textarch/roc-11/roc11-09.htm|title=Ice-T speaks out on censorship, Cop Killer, his leaving Warner Bros., and more|access-date=October 9, 2007|last=Heck|first=Mike|publisher=The Roc|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013112856/http://theroc.org/roc-mag/textarch/roc-11/roc11-09.htm|archive-date=October 13, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> In an interview, Ice-T stated that "I didn't want my band to get pigeon-holed as that's the only reason that record sold. It just got outta hand and I was just tired of hearing it. I said, 'fuck it,' I mean they're saying we did it for money, and we didn't. I'd gave the record away, ya know, let's move on, let's get back to real issues, not a record but the cops that are out there killing people."<ref name="Roc"/>

"Cop Killer" was replaced by a new version of "Freedom of Speech", a song from Ice-T's 1989 solo album ''[[The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech... Just Watch What You Say!]]''. The song was re-edited and remixed to give it a more rock-oriented sound. Ice-T left Warner Bros. Records the following year because of disputes over the Ice-T solo album ''[[Home Invasion (album)|Home Invasion]]'',<ref name="IceOpinion"/> taking Body Count with him. Despite the controversy, the album received some praise, including A- reviews from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' and ''[[The Village Voice]]'', who later ranked the album among their list of ''The 40 Best Albums of 1992''.<ref name="VillageVoice">{{cite news |title=The 40 Best Albums Of 1992 |newspaper=[[The Village Voice]] |date=March 2, 1993 }}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that the album had sold 480,000 copies by January 29, 1993.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Augusto |first1=Troy J. |last2=Turman |first2=Katherine |title=WB board put Ice-T out in cold |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR103473.html?categoryid=16&cs=1 |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=January 29, 1993 |access-date=October 9, 2007 }}</ref>

===Continued albums: ''Born Dead'', ''Violent Demise'' and ''Murder 4 Hire'' (1993–2008)===
[[File:Icet.jpg|right|thumb|Ice-T performing with Body Count in 2006]]
In 1993, Body Count recorded a cover of "[[Hey Joe]]" for the [[Jimi Hendrix]] tribute album ''[[Stone Free: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r188440|pure_url=yes}} |title=''Stone Free: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix'' overview |access-date=October 9, 2007 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |website=[[AllMusic]] }}</ref> The band released their second album, ''[[Born Dead]]'' in 1994 on [[Virgin Records]]. Prior to the recording of Body Count's third album ''[[Violent Demise: The Last Days]]'' (1997), bassist Mooseman left the group and was replaced by Griz. Drummer Beatmaster V died of [[leukemia]] soon after the album was completed,<ref name="RSdeaths">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/icet/articles/story/6436921/body_count_guitarist_dead |title=Body Count Guitarist Dead |access-date=October 9, 2007 |last=Devenish |first=Colin |date=August 19, 2004 |magazine=Rolling Stone |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013111109/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/icet/articles/story/6436921/body_count_guitarist_dead |archive-date=October 13, 2007 }}</ref> and a new drummer named O.T. filled in the position. Bassist Griz left the band later on, and in the meanwhile, former bassist Mooseman was shot in a drive-by shooting in February 2001 after recording an album and preparing for another tour with [[Iggy Pop]] in his band the Trolls.<ref name="RSdeaths"/> In late 2004, rhythm guitarist D-Roc died due to complications from lymphoma, leaving only Ice-T and Ernie C from the original line-up.<ref name="RSdeaths"/>

Ice-T has stated that "For me, honestly, after something like that, you can either come to a dead stop or you can go on. [...] It was so emotional. We were in the middle of making a new record together and he goes and dies? It was like, 'damn!' Soon enough, though, everybody was like, 'c'mon c'mon you gotta do it.' It was make-or-break. The key essence of Body Count is it's a band made up of friends. It's not about going out and hiring the best drummer or the best guitarist. If we don't know you, you can't be in the band."<ref name="Escapi"/>

In July 2006, Body Count released their fourth album, ''[[Murder 4 Hire]]'' on the indie record label Escapi Music.<ref name="Escapi"/> Its album cover, featuring [[Uncle Sam]] holding a cardboard sign reading "Will Kill for Money", compares the [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]] to [[Contract killing|contract killers]].<ref name="Decibel">{{cite web |url=http://www.decibelmagazine.com/features_detail.aspx?id=4908 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020204850/http://www.decibelmagazine.com/features_detail.aspx?id=4908 |archive-date=October 20, 2006 |title=Interview with Ice-T |access-date=October 9, 2007 |last=Bennett |first=J |publisher=[[Decibel Magazine]]}}</ref> The then-line-up included drummer O.T., bassist Vincent Price and rhythm guitarist Bendrix. The band then took an extended hiatus for a couple of years; in regards to the future of Body Count, Ernie C stated, "We will carry on the band. I don't know if it will be Body Count, but in some form, Ice and I will always play together."<ref name="RSdeaths"/>

===Hiatus, ''Gears of War 3'' soundtrack (2009–2012)===
The band's presence between after 2009 was sporadic: On September 6, 2009, Body Count made an appearance at the [[Warped Tour|Vans Warped Tour]] 15th-anniversary party at Club Nokia in downtown Los Angeles. The group played a 20-minute set, covered [[Slayer]], and closed with their controversial classic "Cop Killer".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=126679 |date=September 9, 2009 |title=Body Count Is Back! |access-date=September 11, 2009 |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913052821/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=126679 |archive-date=September 13, 2009 }}</ref> Also on the bill were [[NOFX]], [[Katy Perry]], [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]], [[Bad Religion]] and [[Rise Against]].

==Style==
===Lyrics===
Ice-T's lyrics focus on reality-based themes, including [[gang]] life, because he felt it would be scarier than the fantasy-based horror themes of most heavy metal bands.<ref name=IceCentury-127/> The band's third album, ''[[Violent Demise: The Last Days]]'', featured album cover art depicting the hand signs of these gangs.<ref name=IceCentury-127/> According to Ice-T, "We named the group Body Count because every Sunday night in L.A., I'd watch the news, and the newscasters would tally up the youths killed in gang homicides that week and then just segue to sports. 'Is that all I am,' I thought, 'a body count?'"<ref name="IceOpinion"/>

When the band's debut album was released, Ice-T defined it as being "a rock album with a rap mentality".<ref name="Dellamora">{{cite book |last=Dellamora |first=Richard |title=Postmodern Apocalypse: Theory and Cultural Practice at the End |year=1995 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=0-8122-1558-3 }}</ref> Like Ice-T's hip hop albums, the group's material focused on various social and political issues, with songs focusing on topics ranging from police brutality to drug abuse.

===Music===
Body Count's musical style derives from the dark, ominous tones of traditional [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands such as [[Black Sabbath]] and [[thrash metal]] bands such as [[Slayer]],<ref name=IceCentury-127>{{cite book |last1=Marrow |first1=Tracy |last2=Century |first2=Douglas |title=Ice: A Memoir of Gangster Life and Redemption—from South Central to Hollywood |year=2011 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-0-345-52328-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icememoirofgangs00icet/page/127 127–140] |chapter=Freedom of Speech |chapter-url-access=registration |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/icememoirofgangs00icet/page/127 }}</ref> as well as [[hardcore punk]]'s aggressiveness. According to Ernie C, "We wanted to be a big [[punk rock|punk]] band [...] Our first record is almost a punk record."<ref name="MorningCall"/> The presence of a rapper in a heavy metal band has been credited for paving the way for the rise of [[rap metal]] and [[nu metal]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Body Count's Ice-T Talks Shit but Does the Shooting|url=http://decibelmagazine.com/blog/featured/body-counts-ice-t-talks-shit-but-does-the-shooting|website=Decibel Magazine|access-date=May 2, 2015|date=June 4, 2014|quote=Back in the day, Body Count was categorized as "rap metal" or "nu metal."
