'''1349''' is a Norwegian [[black metal]] band from [[Oslo, Norway]], formed in 1997. The band's name is a reference to the year the [[Black Death]] reached Norway.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.tartareandesire.com/interviews/1349.html| title=1349 Interview| publisher=tartareandesire.com| quote=What is the meaning behind the name 1349? 1349 is the year the Black Death (a bubonic plague) came to norway, wiping out a third of the population and ending the golden age of Norway.| date=June 2003| accessdate=30 March 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080409150853/http://www.tartareandesire.com/interviews/1349.html| archivedate= 9 April 2008}}</ref>

== History ==
1349 formed in 1997 and comprises several former members of the band [[Alvheim]]. Drummer [[Kjetil Haraldstad|Frost]] is also a member of [[Satyricon (band)|Satyricon]].

In recognition of 1349's influences, the band performed a cover of [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]]'s "Buried by Time and Dust" on their debut album, ''[[Liberation (1349 album)|Liberation]]''. At 1349's live shows, the band has also covered [[Celtic Frost]], whom vocalist Ravn cites as his principal influence.

1349 tours on a regular basis. The band's live shows often begin with Frost and guitarist Archaon breathing fire. In 2006, 1349 toured the US with Celtic Frost.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/and-sahg-to-support-celtic-frost-on-u-s-tour/| title=1349 and Sahg to support Celtic Frost on U.S. tour| publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]| date=5 July 2006| accessdate=25 December 2009}}</ref> Ravn also appeared on the Celtic Frost album ''[[Monotheist (album)|Monotheist]]'' (2006), performing guest vocals on the CD digipack bonus track, "Temple of Depression". In 2007, during the French [[Hellfest Summer Open Air|Hellfest]] festival, 1349 was slated to play during the day, but asked to reschedule their appearance to play in the dark instead.<ref>{{cite web

A music video for "Sculptor of Flesh" was made following the release of ''[[Hellfire (album)|Hellfire]]'' (2005). The video, directed by Judd Tilyard, alternates between footage of the band performing the song in Norway and clips of surgery filmed in Australia.

During late 2008, 1349 recorded its fourth album, ''[[Revelations of the Black Flame]]''.<ref name="blackflame">{{cite web| url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=39842371&blogID=464454947| title=New album – update| publisher=Band myspace page| quote=1349 are currently putting their last touch to the bands new album entitled ''Revelations of the Black Flame'', follow-up to 2005's Hellfire.

''Revelations of the Black Flame'' marked a change in direction for the band, as songs on the album were slower than previous releases, and there were also some dark ambient and industrial-tinged tracks.

At the beginning of 2010 the band signed a contract with [[Indie Recordings]] for the release of its fifth album in Europe, with [[Prosthetic Records]] distributing the album in North America.<ref name="blabber-demonoir">{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/new-album-title-announced/|title=1349: new album title announced|date=23 February 2010|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|accessdate=23 February 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100226032508/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=135615| archivedate= 26 February 2010}}</ref>

1349 released its fifth album, ''[[Demonoir]]'', on 26 April 2010. The album shows a return to 1349's earlier sound, before ''[[Revelations of the Black Flame]]'', while continuing the low-fi production and ambient sensibilities of ''Revelations''. 1349 toured Canada and the United States with Tom Gabriel Fischer's project [[Triptykon]] in October 2010. A deluxe box set of ''Demonoir'' was released in October 2011. The band's first live DVD, titled ''Hellvetia Fire – The Official 1349 Bootleg'', was released on 24 October 2011 by Candlelight Records.
