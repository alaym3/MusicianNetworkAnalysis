'''William Ezechukwu Onyeabor''' ({{IPAc-en|ɒ|n|ˈ|j|ɑː|b|ɔː|}}, {{respell|on|YAH|baw}}; 26 March 1946 – 16 January 2017) was a Nigerian [[funk]] musician and businessman.<ref name="New Yorker 2014">{{cite news|last=Donohue|first=John|title=Doctor Who|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/2014/05/05/140505goli_GOAT_nightlife_donohue|access-date=5 January 2021|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=5 May 2014|page=16}}</ref> His music was widely heard in Nigeria in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but he remained an enigmatic figure, private and reclusive.

Onyeabor's songs are often heavily rhythmic and synthesized, occasionally epic in scope, with lyrics decrying war, sung by both Onyeabor himself and female backing vocalists. In the 2010s, some of his songs appeared on various compilations, most frequently his biggest hit, "Better Change Your Mind", which appeared on ''Africa 100'', ''World Psychedelic Classics 3: Love's a Real Thing – The Funky Fuzzy Sounds of West Africa'',<ref>{{cite news |title=The Temptations of the Power Ballad |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/13/arts/music/13play.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 February 2005 |access-date=27 July 2010 | first=Jon | last=Pareles}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=A whole new beginning; New New Pornographers, no coup for Trews and some funky good times |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/886680641.html?dids=886680641:886680641&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Aug+25%2C+2005&author=MICHAEL+BARCLAY&pub=The+Record&desc=A+whole+new+beginning%3B+New+New+Pornographers%2C+no+coup+for+Trews+and+some+funky+good+times&pqatl=google |work=[[Waterloo Region Record|The Record]] |date=25 August 2005 |access-date=27 July 2010 | first=Michael | last=Barclay}}</ref> and ''Nigeria 70: The Definitive Story of 1970's Funky Lagos'',<ref>{{cite news |title=Various – Nigeria 70 |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=10573910 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=22 May 2009 |access-date=27 July 2010 |first=Scott |last=Kara}}</ref> through labels such as [[Luaka Bop]].

==Biography==
Onyeabor was born into a poor family, but became financially successful enough to travel to Europe to study record manufacturing.<ref name=graun>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/18/who-was-william-onyeabor-nigerian-synthesizer-whiz |title=William Onyeabor: one of music's most insoluble puzzles to the end |last=Lynskey |first=Dorian |date=18 January 2017 |website=[[theguardian.com]]|access-date=18 January 2017}}</ref> Some biographies claim that he studied [[cinematography]] in [[Russia]], returning to Nigeria in the 1970s to start his own Wilfilms music label and to set up a recording and production studio. He was later crowned a [[High Chief]] in [[Enugu]], where he lived as a businessman working on government contracts and running his own [[semolina]] flour mill.<ref>[http://www.roughtrade.com/events/2013/10/233 "A William Onyeabor Experience", Rough Trade Records]. Retrieved 11 October 2013</ref><ref name=graun /> His business successes saw him named West African Industrialist of the Year in 1987.<ref name=graun />

According to the Luaka Bop record label, Onyeabor "self-released eight albums between 1977 and 1985 and then became a [[born-again Christian]], refusing to ever speak about himself or his music again." The label reported that through attempting to speak with Onyeabor himself, and by talking to people who seem to have firsthand knowledge, it tried to construct an accurate biography of him for 18 months, without success.<ref>[http://luakabop.com/onyeabor/ "Who is William Onyeabor?", Luaka Bop Records]. Retrieved 11 October 2013</ref>

In 2014, the music website Noisey, affiliated to ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' magazine, released a 31-minute documentary entitled ''Fantastic Man'' that documents Onyeabor's history and legacy as well as Noisey's attempt to track him down for an interview.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiaRp0M2fxE/ Fantastic Man – A Film About William Onyeabor].
