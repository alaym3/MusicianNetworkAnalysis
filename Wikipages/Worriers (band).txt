==History==
Worriers are a Brooklyn-based punk rock band formed by singer, guitarist, and songwriter Lauren Denitzio in 2011, who was previously a member of the Measure and is also a visual artist and a published author. Denitzio (who was credited as Lauren Measure on the group's first recordings) has been the sole constant in the Worriers' lineup, with [[Mikey Erg]], [[Caves (band)|Lou Hanman]], John McLean, Rachel Rubino, Nick Psillas, and Audrey Zee Whitesides among Denitzio's most frequent collaborators.<ref name="Allmusic Bio">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/worriers-mn0002769163/biography|title=Worriers Biography|last=Deming|first=Mark|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=12 May 2018}}</ref>

The band released their first single ''Past Lives'' on [[No Idea Records]] in May 2011. After a second single, ''Sinead O'Rebellion'' through Yo-Yo Records, Worriers teamed up with [[Don Giovanni Records]] for the seven-song EP ''Cruel Optimist'' in October 2013.

In 2015 Worriers returned with ''Imaginary Life'', the band's first album, with all songs written solely by Denitzio, and produced by [[Laura Jane Grace]] of [[Against Me!]] For this record the Worriers' lineup included Denitzio on lead vocals and guitar, guitarists Rachel Rubino and John McLean, bassist Audrey Zee Whitesides, and drummer Mike Yannich, with Lou Hanman guesting on backing vocals.<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/>

The band signed with [[SideOneDummy Records]] in June 2017, and released their second album ''Survival Pop'' in September of that year. For this record Denitzio was backed by Hanman on guitar, Nick Psillas on bass, and Mikey Erg on drums.<ref name="Allmusic Survival Pop">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/survival-pop-mw0003093299/credits|title=Worriers Survival Pop Credits|website=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> With the scaling back of SideOneDummy's operations in early 2018 the band re-released the album with 6131 Records, and the addition of two new songs.

On December 12, 2019 Worriers announced they would be releasing a third album titled ''You or Someone You Know'', again with 6131 Records, on March 6, 2020.
