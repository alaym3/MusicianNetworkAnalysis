==Biography==
{{More citations needed|section|date=March 2021}}
Originally from [[Anchorage, Kentucky]], a suburb of [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], Osborne moved to New York City in the late 1980s to study filmmaking at New York University, where she had classes with legendary documentarian [[George C. Stoney|George Stoney]], among others. Osborne was paying her own way through college and taking time off to earn money for another semester when, by chance, she sang at an open mic night at the Abilene Café. The other musicians encouraged her to return, and she began singing weekly at the Abilene's open mic and at other blues open mics in NYC's East Village. She soon became immersed in NYC's live music scene, forming her own band and playing in nightclubs alongside groups like the Sweetones, [[Surreal McCoys]], [[Spin Doctors]], [[Blues Traveler]], and the [[Holmes Brothers]], and artists like [[Chris Whitley]], [[Frankie Paris]], and [[Jeff Buckley]].

In 1991, she formed her own record label, Womanly Hips, to release her first full-length album, ''[[Soul Show: Live at Delta 88]]'', and she began to tour around the Northeast, building a devoted regional following. She signed a recording contract with Rick Chertoff of [[Mercury Records]], and released her second (and first major label) album ''[[Relish (album)|Relish]]'' (1995), which became a hit on the strength of the single "[[One of Us (Joan Osborne song)|One of Us]]". "Right Hand Man" and "St. Teresa" were minor hits, and "Spider Web" also received radio play. Osborne wrote and directed the second music video for "St. Teresa".

Osborne was a co-headliner for the [[Lilith Fair]] in 1997.

In 2001, Osborne produced an album for her friends the [[Holmes Brothers]], ''Speaking in Tongues'', engineered by Grammy winner [[Trina Shoemaker]] and featuring backing vocals from [[Catherine Russell (singer)|Catherine Russell]], [[Maydie Miles]], and Osborne. The album was released by Alligator Records.

In 2001, Osborne appeared on ''[[Austin City Limits]]'', singing material mainly from ''[[Righteous Love]]''. In a brief interview segment at the end of the episode, Osborne reflects on her gladness to have gotten out of the limelight of her mid-1990s stardom. She was featured in the 2002 documentary film ''[[Standing in the Shadows of Motown]]'', and toured with [[Motown Records|Motown]] sidemen [[The Funk Brothers]]. She and her band accompanied the [[Dixie Chicks]] for a national tour in the summer of 2003, during which time she also joined veteran San Francisco jam-rockers [[The Dead (band)|The Dead]] as a vocalist, and released her fourth album, titled ''How Sweet It Is'', a collection of classic [[rock and roll|rock]] and [[soul music|soul]] [[cover version|covers]].

During 2005 and 2006, Osborne performed on numerous occasions with [[Phil Lesh and Friends]]. Her vocals were featured prominently on the album ''[[Live at the Warfield]]''.  She continues to make appearances with the band.

In February 2007, she appeared on the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]''. In May 2007, she issued ''[[Breakfast in Bed (album)|Breakfast in Bed]]'', produced by [[Tor Hyams]], a return to the soul music that she had covered on ''How Sweet It Is''. ''Breakfast in Bed'' also featured the two songs ("[[(Love Is Like a) Heat Wave|Heatwave]]" and "[[What Becomes of the Brokenhearted]]") that she had covered for the film ''[[Standing in the Shadows of Motown]]''. The same year, Osborne appeared as a featured guest in the third season of the ''[[Transatlantic Sessions]]'' television series, performing "Saint Teresa", "Holy Water", and "Please Don't Tell Me How the Story Ends".

Osborne sang lead vocals on the cover of the [[Willie Dixon]]-penned  "[[Spoonful]]" on [[Vivian Campbell]]'s solo album ''Two Sides of If''. She also provided some vocals for "Wayfaring Stranger" on [[Michael Franti|Spearhead]]'s 1997 album ''[[Chocolate Supa Highway]]''. She covered [[Dolly Parton]]'s "Do I Ever Cross Your Mind" on the 2003 tribute album ''[[Just Because I'm a Woman: Songs of Dolly Parton]]''. She is featured on the Holmes Brothers 2007 collection ''State of Grace'' performing "[[Those Memories of You]]", an old Alan O'Bryant [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] tune.

Osborne released the studio album ''[[Little Wild One]]'' in September 2008. She performed as a guest vocalist on ''[[Sgt. Pepper Live]]'', the 2009 album and DVD by [[Cheap Trick]]. In 2010, she was awarded the Woman of Achievement Award from [[Women's Project Theater]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wptheater.org/special-events/award-recipients/ |title=Women of Achievement Honorees |website=Women's Project Theater |access-date=October 7, 2014}}</ref> She performed with [[The Waybacks]] at [[Merlefest]], 2011, during the Hillside Album hour, featuring [[The Allman Brothers]]' ''Eat a Peach''.
