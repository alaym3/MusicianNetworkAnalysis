'''Guapo''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[experimental rock]]/[[art rock]] band formed in the mid-1990s by drummer/percussionist Dave Smith and guitarist/vocalist Matt Thompson, though the band gained a wider audience with the contribution of multi-instrumentalist [[Daniel O'Sullivan (musician)|Daniel O'Sullivan]].  The current lineup consists of Smith, guitarist [[Kavus Torabi]], bassist [[James Sedwards]] and keyboardist Emmett Elvin of [[Chrome Hoof]].

==Music==
Guapo have affiliations with the [[Rock in Opposition]] movement, after performing with bands such as [[Magma (band)|Magma]] and [[Present (band)|Present]] at the [[Rock in Opposition]] Festival at [[Carmaux]], [[France]] in 2007.

==The Trilogy==
The Guapo album ''Elixirs'' concludes a recondite trilogy of recordings initiated by ''[[Five Suns (album)|Five Suns]]'' (2003) and ''Black Oni'' (2004), which has been referred to as the "[https://web.archive.org/web/20080306022637/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/18272-black-oni Empire Strikes Back]" record. Every record takes on new musical hues and offers disparate ideas and perspectives. However, an upheaval in the line-up, which of recent years had been anchored by the trio of Daniel O'Sullivan, Matthew Thompson, and David Smith, triggered a change in course when Thompson left the band in 2005.

==Other projects==
Both Smith and O'Sullivan perform in the antique-prog band [[Daniel O'Sullivan (musician)|Miasma & the Carousel of Headless Horses]]. Smith created a large scale, multi media installation entitled "The Other Side of the Island" for which he made a soundtrack with O’Sullivan and Antti Uusimaki under The Stargazers Assistant moniker (the recordings of which were released on Aurora Borealis last year). Smith also plays with members of [[Coil (band)|Coil]], [[Cyclobe]] and [[Shock Headed Peters]] in the Amal Gamal Ensemble. Despite these distractions, Guapo has been maintained as a primary focus and "Elixirs" has been three years in the making.

==Line-up==
Following the departure of Thompson, O’Sullivan and Smith added two London musicians to the fold, [[James Sedwards]] (of avant-rock band Nought) and [[Kavus Torabi]] (of [[Cardiacs]], Knifeworld and formerly [[The Monsoon Bassoon]]). The line-up toured the US in 2006 with synth-prog band, [[Zombi (band)|Zombi]].  O'Sullivan recently left the band to concentrate on other projects ([[Deep in Ocean Sunk the Lamp of Light|Æthenor]] (Vhf Records), Mothlite ([[Southern Records]]), Grumbling Fur as well as moonlighting in the live line-up of [[Sunn O)))]]) and keyboardist Emmett Elvin recently joined. More recently Sam Warren (Tunguska Butterfly, Thumpermonkey) has joined on bass.
