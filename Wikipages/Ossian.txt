'''Ossian''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|ʃ|ən|,_|ˈ|ɒ|s|i|ən}}; [[Irish Gaelic]]/[[Scottish Gaelic]]: ''Oisean'') is the narrator and purported author of a cycle of [[epic poem]]s published by the Scottish poet [[James Macpherson]], originally as ''Fingal'' (1761) and ''Temora'' (1763),<ref name=oxford-mythical>{{cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History|editor=T. M. Devine, Jenny Wormald|chapter=Mythical Scotland|authors=Colin Kidd, James Coleman|pages=67-70|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4f8xhlabjPsC&pg=PA67}}</ref> and later combined under the title ''The Poems of Ossian''. Macpherson claimed to have collected [[word-of-mouth]] material in [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]], said to be from ancient sources, and that the work was his translation of that material. Ossian is based on [[Oisín]], son of Finn or [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]], anglicised to Finn McCool,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rainbolt |first1=Dawn |title=Finn McCool & the Giant’s Causeway |url=https://www.wildernessireland.com/blog/build-bridge-myths-legends-giants-causeway/ |website=Wilderness Ireland |access-date=7 February 2020}}</ref> a legendary bard who is a character in [[Irish mythology]].  Contemporary critics were divided in their view of the work's authenticity, but the current consensus is that Macpherson largely composed the poems himself, drawing in part on traditional Gaelic poetry he had collected.<ref name=britannica/>

The work was internationally popular, translated into all the literary languages of Europe and was highly influential both in the development of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] and the [[Gaelic revival]]. Macpherson's fame was crowned by his burial among the literary giants in [[Westminster Abbey]]. [[William Paton Ker|W.P. Ker]], in the ''Cambridge History of English Literature'', observes that "all Macpherson's craft as a philological impostor would have been nothing without his literary skill."<ref>In ''The Cambridge History of English Literature'', vol. 10 "The Age of Johnson": "The Literary Influence of the Middle Ages" p. 228.</ref>

==The poems==
[[File:Krafft Ossian und Malvina.jpg|thumb|''Ossian and Malvina'', by [[Johann Peter Krafft]], 1810.]]

In 1760 Macpherson published the English-language text ''Fragments of ancient poetry, collected in the Highlands of Scotland, and translated from the Gaelic or Erse language''.<ref name="litpedia">{{citation |title=[[The Literary Encyclopedia (English)|Literary Encyclopedia]] |year=2004 |contribution-url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&UID=9045 |contribution=Fragments of Ancient Poetry, Collected in the Highlands of Scotland |access-date=27 December 2006}}</ref> Later that year, he claimed to have obtained further manuscripts and in 1761 he claimed to have found an [[Epic poetry|epic]] on the subject of the hero Fingal (with Fingal or ''Fionnghall'' meaning "white stranger"<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.behindthename.com/php/view.php?name=fingal |title=Behind the Name: View Name: Fingal}}</ref>), written by Ossian. According to Macpherson's prefatory material, his publisher, claiming that there was no market for these works except in English, required that they be translated. Macpherson published these translations during the next few years, culminating in a collected edition, ''The Works of Ossian'', in 1765. The most famous of these Ossianic poems was ''Fingal'', written in 1761 and dated 1762.

The supposed original poems are translated into poetic prose, with short and simple sentences.  The mood is [[epic poetry|epic]], but there is no single narrative, although the same characters reappear.  The main characters are Ossian himself, relating the stories when old and blind, his father Fingal (very loosely based on the Irish hero [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]]), his dead son Oscar (also with an [[Oscar (Irish mythology)|Irish counterpart]]), and Oscar's lover [[Malvina (character)|Malvina]] (like [[Fiona]] a name invented by Macpherson), who looks after Ossian in his old age.  Though the stories "are of endless battles and unhappy loves", the enemies and causes of strife are given little explanation and context.<ref name="Okun, 328">Okun, 328</ref>

Characters are given to killing loved ones by mistake, and dying of grief, or of joy.  There is very little information given on the religion, culture or society of the characters, and buildings are hardly mentioned.  The landscape "is more real than the people who inhabit it. Drowned in eternal mist, illuminated by a decrepit sun or by ephemeral meteors, it is a world of greyness."<ref name="Okun, 328"/> Fingal is king of a region of south-west Scotland perhaps similar to the historical kingdom of [[Dál Riata]] and the poems appear to be set around the 3rd century, with the "king of the world" mentioned being the Roman Emperor; Macpherson and his supporters detected references to [[Caracalla]] (d. 217, as "Caracul") and [[Carausius]] (d. 293, as "Caros", the "king of ships").<ref>[http://www.exclassics.com/ossian/aera.htm "A Dissertation concerning the Aera of Ossian"], published as prefatory matter in later editions of the poems.</ref>

==Reception and influence==
The poems achieved international success. [[Napoleon]] and [[Diderot]] were prominent admirers and [[Voltaire]] was known to have written parodies of them.<ref>Howard Gaskill, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=uDYPtqw0MHwC&pg=PA140 The reception of Ossian in Europe]'' (2004)</ref> [[Thomas Jefferson]] thought Ossian "the greatest poet that has ever existed",<ref>Quoted in {{cite journal|first=Frederick|last=Carpenter|title=The Vogue of Ossian in America|journal=American Literature|volume=2|year=1930–1931|pages=405–17}}</ref> and planned to learn Gaelic so as to read his poems in the original.<ref>{{cite book |year=1989 |editor1-last=Wilson |editor1-first=Douglas L. |title=Thomas Jefferson's Literary Commonplace Book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2wwABAAAQBAJ&pg=PA172|location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=172 |isbn=0691047200 |access-date=8 April 2015 }}</ref> They were proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] writers such as [[Homer]].  "The genuine remains of Ossian...are in many respects of the same stamp as the Iliad," was Thoreau's opinion.<ref>Thoreau, Henry David. ''Thoreau: Collected Essays and Poems''. The Library of America. p. 141. {{ISBN|1-883011-95-7}}</ref> Many writers were influenced by the works, including [[Walter Scott]], and painters and composers chose Ossianic subjects.

The Hungarian national poet [[Sándor Petőfi]] wrote a poem entitled ''Homer and Ossian'', comparing the two authors, of which the first verse reads:
{{poemquote|
Oh where are you Hellenes and Celts?
Already you have vanished, like
Two cities drowning
In the waters of the deep.
Only the tips of towers stand out from the water,
Two tips of towers: Homer, Ossian.}}

Despite its doubtful authenticity, the Ossian cycle popularized Scottish national mythology across Europe, and became one of the earliest and most popular texts that inspired romantic nationalist movements over the following century. European historians agree that the Ossian poems and their vision of mythical Scotland spurred the emergence of enlightened patriotism on the continent and played a foundational role in the making of modern European nationalism.<ref name=oxford-mythical/>

The cycle had less impact in the British Isles. [[Samuel Johnson]] held it up as "another proof of Scotch conspiracy in national falsehood," while the Irish objected to what they saw as Macpherson's misappropriation of their own traditions. [[David Hume]] eventually withdrew his initial support of Macpherson and quipped that he could not accept the claimed authenticity of the poems even if "fifty bare-arsed Highlanders" vouched for it. By the early 19th century, the cycle came to play a limited role in Scottish patriotic rhetoric.<ref name=oxford-mythical/>

==Authenticity debate==
[[File:François Pascal Simon Gérard 001.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''Ossian Evoking ghosts on the Edge of the Lora'', by [[François Gerard|François Pascal Simon Gérard]], 1801]]

There were immediate disputes of Macpherson's claims on both literary and political grounds. Macpherson promoted a Scottish origin for the material, and was hotly opposed by Irish historians who felt that their heritage was being appropriated. However, both Scotland and Ireland shared a common [[Gaels|Gaelic]] culture during the period in which the poems are set, and some [[Fenian Cycle|Fenian]] literature common in both countries was composed in Scotland.

[[Samuel Johnson]], English author, critic, and biographer, was convinced that Macpherson was "a [[wikt:mountebank|mountebank]], a liar, and a fraud, and that the poems were forgeries".<ref>{{Harvnb|Magnusson|2006|p=340}}</ref> Johnson also dismissed the poems' quality. Upon being asked, "But Doctor Johnson, do you really believe that any man today could write such poetry?" he famously replied, "Yes. Many men. Many women. And many children." Johnson is cited as calling the story of Ossian "as gross an imposition as ever the world was troubled with".<ref name="fagles">Introduction of Robert Fagles' translations of [[The Iliad]] and [[The Odyssey]]</ref> In support of his claim, Johnson also called Gaelic the rude speech of a barbarous people, and said there were no manuscripts in it more than 100 years old. In reply, it was proved that the Advocates' library at Edinburgh contained Gaelic manuscripts 500 years old, and one of even greater antiquity.<ref name=amcyc>{{AmCyc|wstitle=Ossian|inline=1}}</ref>

Scottish author [[Hugh Blair]]'s 1763 ''A Critical Dissertation on the Poems of Ossian'' upheld the work's authenticity against Johnson's scathing criticism and from 1765 was included in every edition of ''Ossian'' to lend the work credibility. The work also had a timely resonance for those swept away by the emerging [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] and the theory of the "[[noble savage]]", and it echoed the popularity of [[Edmund Burke|Burke's]] seminal ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'' (1757).<ref>J. Buchan, ''Crowded with Genius'' (London: Harper Collins, 2003), {{ISBN|0-06-055888-1}}, p. 163.</ref>

In 1766 the Irish antiquarian and Gaelic scholar [[Charles O'Conor (historian)|Charles O'Conor]] dismissed Ossian's authenticity in a new chapter ''Remarks on Mr. Mac Pherson's translation of Fingal and Temora'' that he added to the second edition of his seminal history.<ref>O'Conor, C. ''Dissertations on the ancient history of Ireland (1753) [http://www.exclassics.com/ossian/oconor.pdf (Copy at Ex-Classics)]''</ref> In 1775 he expanded his criticism in a new book, ''Dissertation on the origin and antiquities of the antient Scots''.

[[File:Ossian's Cave front, The Hermitage.JPG|left|thumb|upright=1.2|Ossian's Cave at [[The Hermitage (Scotland)|The Hermitage]] in [[Dunkeld]], Scotland]]

Faced with the controversy, the Committee of the [[Highland Society of London|Highland Society]] enquired after the authenticity of Macpherson's supposed original. It was because of these circumstances that the so-called [[Glenmasan manuscript]] (Adv. 72.2.3) came to light in the late 18th century, a compilation which contains the tale ''Oided mac n-Uisnig''. This text is a version of the Irish ''Longes mac n-Uislenn'' and offers a tale which bears some comparison to Macpherson's "Darthula", although it is radically different in many respects. Donald Smith cited it in his report for the Committee.<ref>{{citation |first=Donald |last=MacKinnon |title=The Glenmasan Manuscript |journal=The Celtic Review |volume=1 |issue=6 |year=1905 |pages=3–17}}</ref>

The controversy raged on into the early years of the 19th century, with disputes as to whether the poems were based on Irish sources, on sources in English, on Gaelic fragments woven into his own composition as Johnson concluded,<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.floridabibliophilesociety.org/Fingal.html |title=Lord Auchinleck's Fingal |publisher=Florida Bibliophile Society |access-date=9 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726060119/http://www.floridabibliophilesociety.org/Fingal.html |archive-date=26 July 2011}}</ref> or largely on Scots Gaelic oral traditions and manuscripts as Macpherson claimed. In the late 19th century, it was demonstrated that the only "original" Gaelic manuscripts that Macpherson produced for the poems were in fact back-translations of his work from English.<ref name=britannica>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ossian|title=Ossian|access-date=Jan 19, 2021}}</ref> During the same period, [[Peter Hately Waddell]] defended the authenticity of the poems, arguing in ''Ossian and the Clyde'' (1875) that poems contained topographical references that could not have been known to Macpherson.<ref>"Waddell, Peter Hately". Dictionary of National Biography. London: Smith, Elder & Co. 1885–19.</ref>

In 1952, the Scottish literary scholar [[Derick Thomson]] investigated the sources for Macpherson's work and concluded that Macpherson had collected genuine Scottish Gaelic [[ballads]], employing scribes to record those that were preserved orally and collating manuscripts, but had adapted them by altering the original characters and ideas, and had introduced a great deal of his own.<ref>{{citation |first=Derick |last=Thomson |title=The Gaelic Sources of Macpherson's 'Ossian' |year=1952}}</ref>

According to historians [[Colin Kidd]] and James Coleman, ''Fingal'' (1761, dated 1762) was indebted to traditional Gaelic poetry composed in the 15th and 16th centuries, as well as to Macpherson's "own creativity and editorial laxity", while the second epic ''Temora'' (1763) was largely his own creation.<ref name=oxford-mythical/>

==Translations and adaptations==

One poem was translated into French in 1762, and by 1777 the whole ''corpus''.<ref name="Okun, 330">Okun, 330</ref> In the German-speaking states [[Michael Denis]] made the first full translation in 1768–69, inspiring the proto-nationalist poets [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock|Klopstock]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], whose own German translation of a portion of Macpherson's work figures prominently in a climactic scene of ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' (1774).<ref>{{Harvnb|Berresford Ellis|1987|p=159}}</ref><ref>Arnold M. ''Thor, myth to marvel''; Continuum Publishing, 2011, pp92-97.</ref> Goethe's associate [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] wrote an essay titled ''Extract from a correspondence about Ossian and the Songs of Ancient Peoples'' (1773) in the early days of the [[Sturm und Drang]] movement.

Complete Danish translations were made in 1790, and Swedish ones in 1794–1800.  In [[Scandinavia]] and Germany the Celtic nature of the setting was ignored or not understood, and Ossian was regarded as a Nordic or Germanic figure who became a symbol for nationalist aspirations.<ref>Okun, 330, 339</ref> In 1799, the French general [[Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte]] named his only son Oscar after the character from Ossian, at the suggestion of [[Napoleon]], the child's godfather and an admirer of Ossian.<ref name="Okun, 330"/> Bernadotte later was made King of [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]]. In 1844, his son became King [[Oscar I of Sweden and Norway]], who was, in turn, succeeded by his sons [[Charles XV of Sweden|Charles XV]] and [[Oscar II]] (d. 1907). "Oscar" being a royal name led to its becoming also a common male first name, especially in Scandinavia but also in other European countries.

[[Melchiore Cesarotti]] was an Italian clergyman whose translation into Italian is said by many to improve on the original, and was a tireless promoter of the poems, in [[Vienna]] and [[Warsaw]] as well as Italy.  It was his translation that Napoleon especially admired,<ref name="Okun, 330"/> and among others it influenced [[Ugo Foscolo]] who was Cesarotti's pupil in the [[University of Padua]].

[[File:Ossiansongs.JPG|thumb|right|''The Songs of Ossian'', ink and watercolours, [[Ingres]], 1811–13]]

By 1800 Ossian was translated into Spanish and Russian, with Dutch following in 1805, and Polish, Czech and Hungarian in 1827–33.<ref name="Okun, 330"/> The poems were as much admired in [[Hungary]] as in France and Germany; Hungarian [[János Arany]] wrote "Homer and Ossian" in response, and several other Hungarian writers – Baróti Szabó, [[Mihály Csokonai Vitéz|Csokonai]], [[Sándor Kisfaludy]], [[Ferenc Kazinczy|Kazinczy]], [[Kölcsey]], [[Ferenc Toldy]], and Ágost Greguss, were also influenced by it.<ref>{{citation |first=Elek |last=Oszkár |title=Ossian-kultusz Magyarországon |journal=Egyetemes Philologiai Közlöny |issue=LVII |year=1933 |pages=66–76}}</ref>

The first partial [[Polish language|Polish]] translation of Ossian was made by [[Ignacy Krasicki]] in 1793. The complete translation appeared in 1838 by [[Seweryn Goszczyński]].

British composer [[Harriet Wainwright]] premiered her opera ''Comala'', based on text by Ossian, in London in 1792.

[[Jean-François Le Sueur|The]] opera ''[[Ossian, ou Les bardes]]'' by [[Jean-François Le Sueur]] (with the famous, multimedial scene of "Ossian's Dream“) was a sell-out at the [[Paris Opera]] in 1804, and transformed the composer's career. The poems also exerted an influence on the burgeoning of [[Romantic music]], and [[Franz Schubert]] in particular composed [[Lieder]] setting many of Ossian's poems. In 1829 [[Felix Mendelssohn]] was inspired to visit the Hebrides and composed the ''[[Hebrides Overture]]'', also known as ''Fingal's Cave''. His friend [[Niels Gade]] devoted his first published work, the concert overture ''Efterklange af Ossian'' ("Echoes of Ossian") written in 1840, to the same subject.

==Ossian and Gaelic print==
{{original research section|date=June 2017}}

Macpherson's ''Ossian'' made a strong impression on [[Dugald Buchanan]] (1716–68), a Perthshire poet whose celebrated ''Spiritual Hymns'' are written in a Scots Gaelic of a high quality that to some extent reflects the language of the classical Gaelic common to the bards of both Ireland and Scotland.  Buchanan, taking the poems of ''Ossian'' to be authentic, was moved to revalue the genuine traditions and rich cultural heritage of the Gaels. At around the same time, he wrote to [[Sir James Clerk, 3rd Baronet|Sir James Clerk of Penicuik]], the leading antiquary of the movement, proposing that someone should travel to the Isles and Western Coast of Scotland and collect the work of the ancient and modern bards, in which alone he could find the language in its purity.

Much later, in the 19th and 20th centuries, this task was taken up by collectors such as [[Alexander Carmichael]]<ref>''Carmina Gadelica'', Alexander Carmichael, printed by T. & A. Constable, Edinburgh, 1900.</ref> and [[Lady Evelyn Stewart Murray]],<ref>''Tales from Highland Perthshire'', collected by Lady Evelyn Stewart Murray, translated and edited by Sylvia Robertson and Tony Dilworth, Scottish Gaelic Texts Society, Volume 20, 2009.</ref> and to be recorded and continued by the work of the [[School of Scottish Studies]] and the Scottish Gaelic Texts Society.

==In art==
Subjects from the Ossian poems were popular in the art of northern Europe, but at rather different periods depending on the country; by the time French artists began to depict Ossian, British artists had largely dropped him.  Ossian was especially popular in [[Danish art]], but also found in Germany and the rest of Scandinavia.

===Britain, Germany and Scandinavia===
British artists began to depict the Ossian poems early on, with the first major work a cycle of paintings decorating the ceiling the "Grand Hall" of [[Penicuik House]] in [[Midlothian]], built by [[Clerk Baronets|Sir James Clerk]], who commissioned the paintings in 1772.  These were by the Scottish painter [[Alexander Runciman]] and lost when the house burnt down in 1899, though drawings and [[etching]]s survive, and two pamphlets describing them were published in the 18th century.<ref>Okun, 331–334</ref> A subject from Ossian by [[Angelica Kauffman]] was shown in the [[Royal Academy]] exhibition of 1773, and Ossian was depicted in ''Elysium'', part of the Irish painter [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]]'s ''magnum opus'' decorating the [[Royal Society of Arts]], at the [[Adelphi Buildings]] in London (still ''in situ'').<ref>Okun, 334–335</ref>

Works on paper by [[Thomas Girtin]] and [[John Sell Cotman]] have survived, though the Ossianic landscapes by George Augustus Wallis, which the Ossian fan [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]] praised in a letter to Goethe, seem to have been lost, as has a picture by [[J.M.W. Turner]] exhibited in 1802.  [[Henry Singleton (painter)|Henry Singleton]] exhibited paintings, some of which were engraved and used in editions of the poems.<ref>Okun, 336–338</ref>

A fragment by [[Novalis]], written in 1789, refers to Ossian as an inspired, holy and poetical singer.<ref>Schmidt, 976</ref>

The Danish painter [[Nicolai Abildgaard]], Director of the [[Copenhagen Academy]] from 1789, painted several scenes from Ossian, as did his pupils including [[Asmus Jacob Carstens]].<ref>Okun, 339–341</ref> His friend [[Joseph Anton Koch]] painted a number of subjects, and two large series of illustrations for the poems, which never got properly into print; like many Ossianic works by Wallis, Carstens, Krafft and others, some of these were painted in Rome, perhaps not the best place to evoke the dim northern light of the poems. In Germany the request in 1804 to produce some drawings as illustrations so excited [[Philipp Otto Runge]] that he planned a series of 100, far more than asked for, in a style heavily influenced by the linear illustrations of [[John Flaxman]]; these remain as drawings only.<ref>Okun, 338–345</ref> Many other German works are recorded, some as late as the 1840s;<ref>Okun, 335–346</ref> word of the British scepticism over the Ossian poems was slow to penetrate the continent, or considered irrelevant.

===France===
[[File:Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson 001.jpg|thumb|left|''Ossian Receiving the Ghosts of Fallen French Heroes'', [[Anne-Louis Girodet]], 1805]]

In France the enthusiasm of Napoleon for the poems accounts for most artistic depictions, and those by the most famous artists, but a painting exhibited in the [[Paris Salon]] in 1800 by [[Paul Duqueylar]] (now [[Musée Granet]], [[Aix-en-Provence]]) excited ''Les Barbus'' ("the Bearded Ones") a group of primitivist artists including [[Pierre-Maurice Quays]] (or Quaï) who promoted living in the style of "early civilizations as described in Homer, Ossian, and the Bible".<ref>Okun, 346–347</ref> Quays is reported as saying: "Homère? Ossian? ... le soleil? la lune? Voilà la question. En vérité, je crois que je préfère la lune. C'est plus simple, plus grand, plus ''primitif''". ("Homer? Ossian? ... the sun? the moon? That's the question. Truthfully I think I prefer the moon. It's more simple, more grand, more ''primitive''").<ref>Rubin, 383</ref> The same year Napoleon was planning the renovation of the [[Château de Malmaison]] as a summer palace, and though he does not seem to have suggested Ossianic subjects for his painters, two large and significant works were among those painted for the reception hall, for which six artists had been commissioned.

[[File:Anne-Louis Girodet.jpg|thumb|left|Study by [[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson|Girodet]] for his ''Ossian'' painting, 1801, [[Louvre]]]]

These were [[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson|Girodet]]'s painting of 1801–02 ''Ossian receiving the Ghosts of the French Heroes'', and ''Ossian Evoking ghosts on the Edge of the Lora'' (1801), by [[François Gérard|François Pascal Simon Gérard]]. Gérard's original was lost in a shipwreck after being bought by the King of Sweden after the fall of Napoleon, but survives in three replicas by the artist (a further one in Berlin was lost in 1945).  One is now at Malmaison (184.5 × 194.5&nbsp;cm / 72.6 × 76.6 in), and the [[Kunsthalle Hamburg]] has another (180,5 × 198,5&nbsp;cm). A [[watercolour]] copy by [[Jean-Baptiste Isabey]] was placed as [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] to Napoleon's copy of the poems.<ref>Okun, 347–348; Rubin throughout, and pp. 384–386 on the variety of titles by which the work has been known; [http://www.musees-nationaux-napoleoniens.org/pages/page_id19162_u1l2.htm Château de Malmaison] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705234627/http://www.musees-nationaux-napoleoniens.org/pages/page_id19162_u1l2.htm |date=5 July 2007 }}</ref>

Duqueylar, Girodet and Gérard, like [[Johann Peter Krafft]] (above) and most of the ''Barbus'', were all pupils of [[Jacques-Louis David|David]], and the clearly unclassical subjects of the Ossian poems were useful for emergent French Romantic painting, marking a revolt against David's [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] choice of historical subject-matter. David's recorded reactions to the paintings were guarded or hostile; he said of Girodet's work: "Either Girodet is mad or I no longer know anything of the art of painting".<ref>Honour, 184–190, 187 quoted</ref>

Girodet's painting (still at Malmaison; 192.5 x 184&nbsp;cm) was a ''success de scandale'' when exhibited in 1802, and remains a key work in the emergence of French Romantic painting, but the specific allusions to the political situation that he intended it to carry were largely lost on the public, and overtaken by the [[Peace of Amiens]] with Great Britain, signed in 1802 between the completion and exhibition of the work.<ref>Okun, 349–351; [http://www.musees-nationaux-napoleoniens.org/pages/page_id19164_u1l2.htm  Chateau de Malmaison] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905195833/http://www.musees-nationaux-napoleoniens.org/pages/page_id19164_u1l2.htm |date=5 September 2008 }}</ref> He also produced ''Malvina dying in the arms of Fingal'' (c. 1802), and other works.

Another pupil of David, [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], was to depict Ossianic scenes over most of his long career. He made a drawing in 1809, when studying in Rome, and in 1810 or 1811 was commissioned to make two paintings, ''[[The Dream of Ossian]]'' and a classical scene, to decorate the bedroom Napoleon was to occupy in the [[Palazzo Quirinale]] on a visit to Rome. In fact the visit never came off and in 1835 Ingres repurchased the work, now in poor condition.
