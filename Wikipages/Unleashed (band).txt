'''Unleashed''' is a Swedish [[death metal]] band that was formed in 1989 by Johnny Hedlund in [[Stockholm]]. Common lyrical themes found in the band's music include [[Viking]] culture, recollection of a pre-Christian world, and [[Norse mythology|Norse]] folklore. A number of their recent songs also contain references to [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. Unleashed (along with [[Dismember (band)|Dismember]], [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]] and [[Grave (band)|Grave]]) is considered one of the "big four" of Swedish death metal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://metal-rules.com/review/viewreview.php?month=June&year=2012&pos=48|title=METAL RULES|date=9 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109113236/http://metal-rules.com/review/viewreview.php?month=June&year=2012&pos=48|access-date=10 October 2020|archive-date=9 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.terrorizer.com/news/news-news/grave-sign-with-century-media/ |title=Grave Sign With Century Media |website=Terrorizer.com |access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>

==History==
Unleashed was founded in 1989 by vocalist and bassist Johnny Hedlund. Unleashed recorded demos "Revenge" and "Utter Dark", which got them a record deal with the German label [[Century Media Records]]. In 1991, the band released their debut [[studio album]], ''[[Where No Life Dwells]]'', and toured with [[Morbid Angel]] in Europe and the US.

In 1992, Unleashed released their second studio album, ''[[Shadows in the Deep]]'', including a [[cover version]] of [[Venom (band)|Venom]]'s "[[Countess Bathory (song)|Countess Bathory]]". Their next studio albums were ''[[Across the Open Sea]]'' in 1993 and ''[[Victory (Unleashed album)|Victory]]'' in 1995, the latter being the last album which guitarist [[Fredrik Lindgren (musician)|Fredrik Lindgren]] played on. Lindgren began to focus strongly on playing punk rock, so Unleashed replaced him with Fredrik Folkare, who played guitar on the fifth Unleashed studio album ''[[Warrior (Unleashed album)|Warrior]]'' in 1997.

The band went on hiatus after 7–8 years of recording and touring. They were concentrating on life outside the music business, their musical side projects, and studying. After a reissue of the band's classics in 2002, the band released a new album called ''[[Hell's Unleashed]]'' in the same year, and they began to tour once again. This was also the same year Hedlund had come under scrutiny because of allegations that he was a [[Nazism|Nazi sympathizer]]. [[Dave Grohl]] of [[Foo Fighters]] initially had intended to approach Hedlund, hoping he would contribute lead vocals to one of the songs for his [[Probot]] metal project, but the album producer, [[Matt Sweeney]], discouraged him from doing so because of the rumors of Hedlund's alleged sympathies.<ref>{{cite web|url         = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=37802|title = DAVE GROHL NIRVANA 'Ripped Off' UNLEASHED Song|publisher   = blabbermouth.net|date        = 2005-06-08|access-date  = 2007-10-02|url-status= dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080116181559/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=37802|archive-date = 2008-01-16}}</ref> Hedlund quickly branded these accusations as false and stated, ''Unleashed praises nature, beast and man. Man....regardless of background, place of birth or color of the skin''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.metalstorm.ee/bands/biography.php?band_id=356&bandname=Unleashed| title=Unleashed Biography| website=Metalstorm.ee| access-date=2007-10-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/unleashed-we-are-not-nazi-sympathizers/|title=UNLEASHED: We Are Not Nazi Sympathizers!|date=2002-10-23|work=BLABBERMOUTH.NET|access-date=2017-08-01}}</ref>

In 2004, Unleashed released their seventh studio album, ''[[Sworn Allegiance]]''. In October 2006, the band released their eighth studio album, ''[[Midvinterblot (album)|Midvinterblot]]''. Unleashed toured Europe in November 2006 as part of the Masters of Death tour, with [[Grave (band)|Grave]], [[Dismember (band)|Dismember]], and [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]]. On February and March 2007, they headlined a North American tour with [[Krisiun]] and [[Belphegor (band)|Belphegor]]. June 2008 saw the release of their ninth studio album entitled ''[[Hammer Battalion]]''.

On 24 July 2009, Unleashed signed a contract with German label [[Nuclear Blast Records]] for the release of their tenth album entitled ''[[As Yggdrasil Trembles]]''. In the press statement the band said, "We are very much looking forward to this new cooperation! The recording of the album is scheduled for October/November this year."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=124143| archive-url=https://archive.today/20120913045931/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=124143| url-status=dead| archive-date=2012-09-13| title=UNLEASHED Signs With NUCLEAR BLAST RECORDS - July 24, 2009}}</ref>

In summer 2010, Unleashed was part of the [[Summer Breeze Open Air]] and the [[With Full Force]] heavy metal festivals in Germany.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=132192|title=1349, REBELLION Confirmed For Germany's SUMMER BREEZE Festival|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=2009-12-17|access-date=2010-03-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606080839/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=132192|archive-date=2011-06-06}}</ref> The band's 11th studio album ''[[Odalheim]]'' was released also on Nuclear Blast Records in April 2012, and their twelfth record ''[[Dawn of the Nine]]'' was released 24 April 2015. Followed three years later by ''[[The Hunt for White Christ]]'' for the Austrian label [[Napalm Records]]. In February 2021, the band has announced that they are at work to the 14th studio album.
