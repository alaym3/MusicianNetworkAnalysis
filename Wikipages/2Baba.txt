== Early life ==
Innocent Ujah Idibia was born in [[Jos]], [[Nigeria]]. He is from the [[Idoma people|Idoma]] ethnic group in the southern part of [[Benue State]], in [[Middle Belt|central Nigeria]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newswatchngr.com/editorial/prime/bob/10109113755.htm |title=Rise and Rise of Tu-Face |publisher=newswatchngr.com |date=9 January 2006 |access-date=6 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715031503/http://www.newswatchngr.com/editorial/prime/bob/10109113755.htm |archive-date=15 July 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref> He attended Mount Saint Gabriel's Secondary School in Makurdi, [[Benue State]]. Tuface enrolled at Institute of Management & Technology, [[Enugu]] (IMT), where he did his preliminary National Diploma course in Business Administration and management. While attending IMT, Idibia performed at school organised shows and parties, as well as other regional schools such as the [[University of Nigeria]] and [[Enugu State University of Science & Technology]]. He eventually dropped out of school to pursue his music career. While attending IMT, 2face Idibia started composing and singing [[jingles]] at the GB Fan Club at [[Enugu State Broadcasting Services]] (ESBS) in 1996.{{fact|date=September 2021}}

Also in 1996, he adopted the stage name "2Face" (Tuface). He cited the reason as "trying to demarcate my personal life with my business life".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLOjyMuKH20  |title=2Face Idibia Live in London |via=YouTube |access-date=11 March 2012}}</ref>

In 2016, he officially changed his name from Tuface to 2Baba.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musicinafrica.net/magazine/2face-%E2%80%98officially%E2%80%99-changes-name-2baba|title=2face ‘officially’ changes name to 2baba |publisher=Music In Africa |access-date=14 January 2016}}</ref>

== In Plantashun Boiz ==
He moved to [[Lagos, Nigeria|Lagos]] and started performing with rapper [[Blackface Naija]]. He met BlackFace during his secondary education in Benue, Nigeria.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pulse.ng/entertainment/music/2face-idibia-heres-both-sides-of-the-story-as-blackface-says-2baba-is-suing-him-for/wb08f8s|title=Here's both sides of the story as Blackface says 2baba is suing him for N50M |website=Pulse |access-date=19 September 2019}}</ref> With Blackface (Ahmedu Augustine Obiabo) and with musician [[Faze (musician)|Faze]] (Chibuzor Orji), he went on to form the trio band called [[Plantashun Boiz]].{{fact|date=September 2021}}

Plantashun Boiz released two successful albums: ''Body and Soul'' (2000) and ''Sold Out'' (2003) under Nelson Brown's label (Dove Records)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thenet.ng/2013/06/2face-idibia-working-with-nelson-brown-on-upcoming-album/|title=2face Idibia working with Nelson Brown on upcoming album |work=Nigerian Entertainment Today |access-date=9 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402170019/http://thenet.ng/2013/06/2face-idibia-working-with-nelson-brown-on-upcoming-album/|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> before disbanding in 2004. Relations were marred for many years during which the band broke up and its members started their solo careers. Long after the break-up known as the "Faze vs Tuface" beef, the band came back together in 2007 for the purpose of recording a third and final album entitled ''Plan B'' (2007).<ref name=Idomaland>{{cite web |url=http://www.idomaland.org/icon/innocent-ujah-idibia-2face |title=Innocent Ujah Idibia (2Face) |website=Idomalang.org |access-date=11 March 2012}}</ref>

On numerous occasions, BlackFace claimed 2Face was performing songs co-written by both of them and not remitting revenues to him. After a long legal and media battle, the matter was finally laid to rest amicably.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.channelstv.com/2019/11/28/theft-claim-blackface-apolgises-to-2baba-settle-out-of-court/|title=Theft Claim: Blackface Apolgises To 2Baba, Settles Out Of Court|website=[[Channels TV]] |access-date=28 November 2019}}</ref>

==Solo career==
After the disbandment of Plantashun Boyz in 2004, all band members sought separate musical careers. 2Baba released his debut solo album ''[[Face 2 Face (2face Idibia album)|Face 2 Face]]'' (2004), which established him as a viable solo artist.{{fact|date=September 2021}}

Following the release of his debut album, he released his second album ''[[Grass 2 Grace]]'' in 2006, which contained hits likes "One Love", "True Love, "4 Instance". 2face is the founder of Hypertek Entertainment.{{fact|date=September 2021}}

==Social crusade and activism==
2Baba has over the years lent his voice to the voice of the oppressed using his celebrity status to bring more awareness to issues of governance in his country and in Africa at large.<ref>{{cite news |title=2Baba calls out African leaders over the oppression of their citizens |url=https://www.pulse.ng/entertainment/celebrities/2face-idibia-calls-out-african-leaders-over-oppression-of-their-citizens/j2enzb8 |date=15 March 2021}}</ref> In April 2021, he chided the [[Nigeria Centre for Disease Control]] for frustrating travelers by collecting a mandatory fee (about N50,000 - fifty thousand naira) for Covid 19 arrival test on the NCDC's portal and the portal not delivering the necessary QR codes needed for this test. Many travelers were stranded because of this.<ref>{{cite news |title=COVID-19: 2baba calls out NCDC for allegedly frustrating travellers |url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/entertainment/music/456649-covid-19-2baba-calls-out-ncdc-for-allegedly-frustrating-travellers.html |date=21 April 2021}}</ref>

==Controversies==
On 25 January 2017, Tuface made an announcement through his [[Instagram]] handle that he would be leading a nationwide protest on 5 February 2017; the protest was against obnoxious policies implemented by the [[Muhammadu Buhari]] administration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/entertainment/music/221502-recession-2face%e2%80%8e-plans-lead-nationwide-protest.html|title=Recession: 2Face plans to lead nationwide protest|last=Augoye|first=Jayne|date=2017-01-25|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lifestyle.thecable.ng/2face-idibia-protest-nationwide/|title=2face announces nationwide protest against 'obnoxious policies' of FG|date=2017-01-25|website=TheCable Lifestyle|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dailypost.ng/2017/01/25/2face-idibia-announces-nationwide-protest-buharis-policies/|title=2face Idibia announces nationwide protest against Buhari's policies|last=Inyang|first=Ifreke|date=2017-01-25|website=Daily Post Nigeria|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref> In a way to stop the protest, the administration through the [[Lagos State|Lagos state]] police commissioner Fatai Owoseni, released a statement that the protest was ban in the state, stating that hoodlums would hijack it and use the protest to cause havoc, the statement was rebuffed and ignored publicly why publicity of the protest continued on social media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://saharareporters.com/2017/02/02/tuface-protest-despite-police-ban-warnings|title=Tuface To Protest Despite Police Ban, Warnings|date=2017-02-02|website=Sahara Reporters|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://guardian.ng/news/police-ban-tuface-from-protesting-in-lagos/|title=Police Ban Tuface from Protesting in Lagos|website=guardian.ng|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref>

On 4 February 2017, Tuface released a video that he was cancelling the protest due to security reasons but rumors circulating around the digital space have it that the administration through the DSS picked him up earlier that day and pressured him to cancel the much-hyped protest, though he later made a series of tweets from his official [[Twitter]] account to deny the claim.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://punchng.com/not-arrested-tuface/|title=I was not arrested – Tuface|website=Punch Newspapers|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dailypost.ng/2017/02/06/cancelled-protest-not-arrested-dss-2face/|title=Cancelled protest: I was not arrested by DSS - 2face|last=Nwachukwu|first=John Owen|date=2017-02-06|website=Daily Post Nigeria|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pulse.ng/entertainment/celebrities/2face-idibia-i-was-not-arrested-by-the-dss-music-star-says/qqp3x4r|title='I was not arrested by the DSS' - music star says|date=2017-02-06|website=pulse.ng|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref>
