'''Aimee Elizabeth Mann''' (born September 8, 1960) is an American singer-songwriter. Over the course of four decades, she has released more than a dozen albums.

Mann was born in [[Richmond, Virginia]], and studied at [[Berklee College of Music]] in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]]. In the 1980s, after playing with the [[the Young Snakes|Young Snakes]] and [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], she co-founded the [[New wave music|new wave]] band [['Til Tuesday]] and wrote their top-ten single "[[Voices Carry]]" (1985). The band released three albums and disbanded in 1990 when Mann left to pursue a solo career.

Mann released her first solo album, ''[[Whatever (Aimee Mann album)|Whatever]]'', in 1993, followed by ''[[I'm with Stupid (album)|I'm With Stupid]]'' in 1995. They received positive reviews but low sales. Mann achieved wider recognition when she recorded songs for the [[Magnolia (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to the [[Paul Thomas Anderson]] film ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'' (1999), earning nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal]].

After Mann's record company [[Geffen Records|Geffen]] refused to release her third solo album, ''[[Bachelor No. 2 or, the Last Remains of the Dodo|Bachelor No. 2]]'', Mann self-released it under her own label, SuperEgo Records, in 2000. She has released seven albums since. She has won two [[Grammy Award]]s and was named one of the world's ten greatest living songwriters by [[NPR]] in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Best Living Songwriters|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5536035|first=Robin|last=Hilton|website=[[NPR]]|date=July 5, 2006|access-date=February 8, 2019}}</ref>

As a teenager, Mann enjoyed [[David Bowie]] and [[Iggy Pop]], and found [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[new wave music]] inspiring.

=== 1990s: Solo beginnings and ''Magnolia'' ===
Mann developed her first solo albums with producer and former 'Til Tuesday bandmate [[Jon Brion]].<ref name=":0" /> Her debut solo album, ''[[Whatever (Aimee Mann album)|Whatever]],'' was released in 1993 on the independent label [[Imago Records|Imago]].<ref name=":4">{{Cite news|last=Meter|first=Jonathan Van|date=1999-07-11|title=What's a record exec to do with Aimee Mann?|language=en-US|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/11/magazine/what-s-a-record-exec-to-do-with-aimee-mann.html|url-access=subscription|access-date=2021-11-07|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> After she finished her second album, ''[[I'm with Stupid (album)|I'm With Stupid]]'', Imago encountered financial problems; they eventually sold the album to [[Geffen Records|Geffen]], who signed Mann in 1994 and released ''I'm With Stupid'' in 1995.<ref name=":4" /> According to ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'', Mann's first two solo albums showed that she was "a witty, self-possessed songwriter", but they did not meet sales expectations, with sales "in the low six figures".<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|last=Berman|first=Judy|date=17 November 2019|title=Aimee Mann: ''Bachelor No. 2 or, the Last Remains of the Dodo''|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/aimee-mann-bachelor-no-2-or-the-last-remains-of-the-dodo/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-11-07|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|language=en}}</ref> Mann began to be seen as "an 80s pop casualty"<ref name="stereogum" /> who was "approaching has-been status".<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|last=McLevy|first=Alex|title=Aimee Mann got cinematic with the gorgeous Magnolia soundtrack|url=https://www.avclub.com/the-magnolia-soundtrack-made-sweet-music-from-a-cinemat-1844139288|url-status=live|access-date=2021-11-07|website=The A.V.

Mann received wider recognition after she contributed songs to the 1999 film ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]''. Her music had inspired the film; director [[Paul Thomas Anderson]] said he "sat down to write an adaptation of Aimee Mann songs".<ref name=":3" /> The film features dialogue taken from Mann's lyrics and a sequence in which the cast sing her song "Wise Up".<ref name=":3" /> The [[Magnolia (soundtrack)|''Magnolia'' soundtrack album]] was eventually [[Certified Gold|certified gold]].<ref name=":3" /> The song "[[Save Me (Aimee Mann song)|Save Me]]" was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] and a [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal]];<ref name=":3" /> Mann performed it at the [[72nd Academy Awards]].<ref name=":5" /> Mann later said the song "really gave a blood transfusion to my career.

=== 2000s: ''Bachelor No. 2, The Forgotten Arm'', ''@#%&*! Smilers'' and label independence ===
Geffen refused to release Mann's third album, ''[[Bachelor No. 2]]'', feeling it contained no hit singles.<ref name=":5" /> In response, Mann sold homemade EPs of her music on tour, a move she described as a "DIY fuck-you-record-company-I'm-selling-it-myself" gesture.<ref name="stereogum" /> When Geffen gave Mann the opportunity to leave her record contract, she took it; she said later: "I could not have gotten out of there fast enough."<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-11-25|title=Aimee Mann Looks Back On 'Bachelor No. 2' In Advance Of 20th Anniversary Reissue|url=https://americansongwriter.com/bachelor-number-two-aimee-mann-album-interview/|access-date=2021-11-07|website=American Songwriter|language=en-US}}</ref>
