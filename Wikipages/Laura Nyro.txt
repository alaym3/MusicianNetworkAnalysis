She achieved critical acclaim with her own recordings, particularly the albums ''[[Eli and the Thirteenth Confession]]'' (1968) and ''[[New York Tendaberry]]'' (1969), and had commercial success with artists such as [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[the 5th Dimension]] recording her songs.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Nyro was born Laura Nigro in the [[Bronx]], the daughter of Louis Nigro, a piano tuner and jazz trumpeter, and Gilda (née Mirsky) Nigro, a bookkeeper. Laura had a younger brother, Jan Nigro, who has become a well-known children's musician.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://singingTelegramGifts.com/about|title=About Jan Nigro — Singing Telegram Gifts|publisher=Singingtelegramgifts.com|access-date=November 17, 2013|archive-date=July 7, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707030326/http://singingtelegramgifts.com/about/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Laura was of Russian Jewish and Polish Jewish descent, with Italian ancestry from her paternal grandfather.<ref name=Rocheleau>{{cite web|url=http://home.earthLink.net/~peter_rocheleau/ |title=The Divine Miss N – An Essay by Peter Rocheleau |publisher=earthLink.net |access-date=April 29, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050208214836/http://home.earthlink.net/~peter_rocheleau/ |archive-date=February 8, 2005 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Bloom|first=Nate|title=Jewish Stars 12/16 |publisher=[[Cleveland Jewish News]]|date=December 15, 2011|url=https://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/archives/jewish-stars/article_7be302da-267e-11e1-b2fe-001871e3ce6c.html|quote=Her maternal grandparents were Russian Jews, as was her father's mother. Her paternal grandfather was Italian Catholic}}</ref>

"I've created my own little world, a world of music, since I was five years old", Nyro told ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine in 1970, adding that music provided, for her, a means of coping with a difficult childhood: "I was never a bright and happy child."<ref>Dexter, Dave, Jr. "Dexter's Scrapbook", ''Billboard'', February 21, 1970, p. 28.</ref> As a child, she taught herself piano, read poetry, and listened to her mother's records by [[Leontyne Price]], [[Nina Simone]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Billie Holiday]], and classical composers such as [[Debussy]] and [[Ravel]]. She composed her first songs at age eight. With her family, she spent summers in the [[Catskills]], where her father played trumpet at resorts. She credited the Sunday school at the [[New York Society for Ethical Culture]] with providing the basis of her education; she also attended Manhattan's [[High School of Music & Art]].<ref name="anb1">{{cite encyclopedia|first=Dawn|last=Lawson|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/18/18-03520.html|title=Nyro, Laura|publisher=American National Biography Online|date=June 2000|access-date=December 7, 2008}}</ref>

Nyro was close to her aunt and uncle, artists [[Theresa Bernstein]] and William Meyerowitz, who helped support her education and early career.<ref>Kort, Michele. ''Soul Picnic: The Music and Passion of Laura Nyro''. New York: St. Martin's Press, Kindle Version, 157/5869</ref><ref>Kort, Michele. ''Soul Picnic: The Music and Passion of Laura Nyro''. New York: St. Martin's Press, Kindle Version, 4790/5869</ref>。

While in high school, she sang with a group of friends in subway stations and on street corners. She said, "I would go out singing, as a teenager, to a party or out on the street, because there were harmony groups there, and that was one of the joys of my youth."<ref name="lauraNyro1">{{cite web|url=http://www.lauraNyro.com/bio.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000304100558/http://www.lauranyro.com/bio.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 4, 2000 |title=Laura Nyro biodata |publisher=Lauranyro.com |work=Laura's Anthology |access-date=December 7, 2008 }}</ref> She commented: "I was always interested in the social consciousness of certain songs. My mother and grandfather were progressive thinkers, so I felt at home in the peace movement and the women's movement, and that has influenced my music."<ref name="lauraNyro1"/>

===Early career===
Louis Nigro's work brought him into contact with record company executive Artie Mogull and his partner Paul Barry, who auditioned Laura in 1966 and became her first managers. However, Nigro later said he did "not even once" mention Laura to any of his clients, adding "they would have laughed at me if I did."<ref name=Rocheleau/>

As a teenager, Laura went by various surnames. She just happened to be using "Nyro" at the time she was discovered, and it stuck.

Mogull had negotiated her a recording and management contract, and she recorded her debut album, ''[[More Than a New Discovery]]'', for the Verve Folkways label (later re-named [[Verve Forecast]]). Later, other songs from the album became hits for The 5th Dimension, [[Blood, Sweat & Tears]], and [[Barbra Streisand]].

On July 13, 1966, Nyro recorded “Stoney End” and “Wedding Bell Blues”, as well as an early version of “Time and Love”, as part of ''More Than A New Discovery'' at Bell Sounds Studios, 237 West 54th Street, Manhattan. About a month later, she sold "[[And When I Die]]" to [[Peter, Paul, and Mary]] for $5,000. On September 17, 1966, Nyro and Verve-Folkways released “Wedding Bell Blues"/"Stoney End” as a single. "Wedding Bell Blues" became a minor hit, especially on the west coast. She completed ''More Than A New Discovery'' in New York on November 29, 1966; and, starting on January 16, 1967, made her first extended professional appearance at age 19, performing nightly for about a month at the "[[hungry i]]" coffeehouse in San Francisco. In February 1967, Verve Folkways released ''More Than A New Discovery''. On March 4, 1967, Nyro appeared on ''Clay Cole's Diskoteck'', Episode 7.23, along with [[Dion and the Belmonts]] and others, but the recording of the episode is lost. On March 21, 1967, she appeared on ''[[Where the Action Is]]" (episode 3.140) with videos of “Wedding Bell Blues” (partially extant), “Blowin' Away” (lost) and "Goodbye Joe" (lost).

On June 17, 1967, Nyro appeared at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]]. Although some accounts described her performance as a fiasco that culminated in her being booed off the stage,<ref>Harrington, Joe S. ''Sonic Cool: The Life and Death of Rock 'n' Roll.'' Hal Leonard (2002), p. 231. {{ISBN|0-634-02861-8}}.</ref> recordings later made publicly available contradict this version of events.<ref name="anb1"/>

Soon afterwards, [[David Geffen]] approached Mogull about taking over as Nyro's agent. Nyro successfully sued to void her management and recording contracts on the grounds that she had entered into them while still a [[Minor (law)|minor]]. Geffen became her manager, and the two established a publishing company, Tuna Fish Music, under which the proceeds from her future compositions would be divided equally between them. Geffen also arranged Nyro's new recording contract with [[Clive Davis]] at [[Columbia Records]], and purchased the publishing rights to her early compositions. In his memoir ''Clive: Inside the Record Business'', Davis recalled Nyro's audition for him: She had invited him to her New York apartment, turned off every light except that of a television set next to her piano, and played him the material that would become ''[[Eli and the Thirteenth Confession]]''. Around this time, she considered becoming lead singer for [[Blood, Sweat & Tears]] after the departure of founder [[Al Kooper]], but was dissuaded by Geffen. Blood, Sweat & Tears went on to have a hit with a cover of Nyro's "And When I Die".

The new contract allowed Nyro more artistic freedom and control. In 1968, Columbia released ''Eli and the Thirteenth Confession'', her second album, which received high critical praise for the depth and sophistication of its performance and arrangements, which merged pop structure with inspired imagery, rich vocals, and avant-garde jazz; it is widely considered one of her best works. It was followed in 1969 by ''[[New York Tendaberry]]'', another highly acclaimed work that cemented Nyro's artistic credibility. "Time and Love" and "[[Save the Country]]" emerged as two of her most well-regarded and popular songs in the hands of other artists. During the weekend after Thanksgiving in November 1969, she gave two concerts at [[Carnegie Hall]].<ref>Tom King, ''The Operator: David Geffen Builds, Buys, and Sells the New Hollywood'', p. 125, Broadway Books (New York 2001).</ref> Her own recordings sold mostly to a faithful cadre of followers. This prompted Clive Davis, in his memoir, to note that her recordings, as solid as they were, came to resemble demonstrations for other performers.

In 1969, Verve reissued Nyro's debut album as ''The First Songs''. The same year Geffen and Nyro sold Tuna Fish Music to CBS for $4.5 million. Under the terms of his partnership with Nyro, Geffen received half of the proceeds of the sale, making them both millionaires.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessWeek.com/stories/1992-06-28/david-geffen-tries-out-a-new-act|title=David Geffen Tries Out A New Act|work=Businessweek.com}}</ref>

Nyro's fourth album, ''[[Christmas and the Beads of Sweat]]'', was released at the end of 1970. It contained "Upstairs By a Chinese Lamp" and "When I Was a Freeport and You Were the Main Drag" and featured [[Duane Allman]] and other [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studio|Muscle Shoals]] musicians. The following year's ''[[Gonna Take a Miracle]]'' was a collection of Nyro's favorite "teenage heartbeat songs", recorded with vocal group [[Labelle]] ([[Patti Labelle]], [[Nona Hendryx]], and [[Sarah Dash]]) and the production team of [[Kenny Gamble]] and [[Leon Huff]]. With the exception of her attribution of "Désiree" (originally "Deserie" by [[The Charts (American group)|the Charts]]), it was Nyro's sole album of wholly non-original material, featuring such songs as "[[Jimmy Mack]]", "[[Nowhere to Run (song)|Nowhere to Run]]" and "[[Spanish Harlem (song)|Spanish Harlem]]".

During 1971, David Geffen worked to establish his own recording label, [[Asylum Records]], in part because of the trouble he had trying to secure a recording contract for another of his clients, [[Jackson Browne]] (with whom Nyro was in a relationship at the time). Geffen invited Nyro to join the new label and announced that she would be Asylum's first signing; however, shortly before the signing was due to take place, Geffen learned that Nyro had re-signed with Columbia instead, without telling him. When interviewed about the matter for a 2012 PBS documentary on his life, Geffen, who'd considered Nyro his best friend, described her rejection as the biggest betrayal of his life up to that point, and said he "cried for days" afterwards.<ref>Lacy, Susan. ''American Masters. Inventing David Geffen'', PBS, 2012.</ref>

By the end of 1971, Nyro was married to carpenter David Bianchini. She was reportedly uncomfortable with attempts to market her as a celebrity and she announced her retirement from the music business at the age of 24. In 1973 her Verve debut album was reissued as ''The First Songs'' by Columbia Records.

===Later career===
By 1976, her marriage had ended, and she released an album of new material, ''[[Smile (Laura Nyro album)|Smile]]''. She then embarked on a four-month tour with a full band, which resulted in the 1977 live album ''[[Season of Lights]]''.

After the 1978 album ''[[Nested]]'', recorded when she was pregnant with her only child, she again took a break from recording, this time until 1984's ''[[Mother's Spiritual]]''. She began touring with a band in 1988, her first concert appearances in 10 years. The tour was dedicated to the [[animal rights movement]]. The shows led to her 1989 release, ''[[Laura: Live at the Bottom Line]]'', which included six new compositions.

Her final album of predominantly original material, ''[[Walk the Dog and Light the Light]]'' (1993), her last album for Columbia, was co-produced by [[Gary Katz]], best known for his work with [[Steely Dan]]. The release sparked reappraisal of her place in popular music, and new commercial offers began appearing. She turned down lucrative film-composing offers, although she contributed a rare protest song to the [[Academy Award]]-winning documentary ''[[Broken Rainbow (film)|Broken Rainbow]]'', about the unjust relocation of the [[Navajo people]].

Nyro performed increasingly in the 1980s and 1990s with female musicians, including her friend Nydia "Liberty" Mata, a drummer, and several others from the lesbian-feminist [[women's music]] subculture, such as members of the band [[Isis (horn-rock band)|Isis]]. She appeared at such venues as the 1989 [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival]] and the 1989 [[Newport Folk Festival]], of which a CD containing portions of her performance was released. On July 4, 1991 she opened for [[Bob Dylan]] at the [[Tanglewood Music Center]] in [[Lenox, Massachusetts]].<ref>Jim Sullivan, ''Boston Globe'', July 5, 1991, p. 10.</ref> Among her last performances were at Union Chapel, Islington, London, England in November 1994; The New York Bottom Line Christmas Eve Show in 1994; and at McCabe's in Los Angeles February 11 and 12, 1995. 
  
''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' pursued Nyro for TV appearances, but she turned them down, citing her discomfort with appearing on television. (She made only a handful of early TV appearances, and one fleeting moment on VH-1 performing the title song from ''Broken Rainbow'' on Earth Day in 1990.) According to producer Gary Katz, she also turned down an invitation to be the musical guest on the 1993 season opener of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref>Denny Sanders, [http://blogs.telosalliance.com/meet-the-man-behind-the-dan "Meet the Man Behind 'the Dan'"] (Gary Katz interview), The Telos Alliance, July 12, 2016.</ref> She never released an official video, although there was talk of filming some ''[[The Bottom Line (venue)|The Bottom Line]]'' appearances in the 1990s.

===Personal life===
Nyro was bisexual, though this fact was known only to her closest friends.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/1997/04/25/laura-nyros-legacy-passion/|title=Laura Nyro's legacy of passion|website=Ew.com|access-date=June 14, 2021}}</ref> She had a relationship with singer/songwriter [[Jackson Browne]] in late 1970 to early 1971. Browne was Nyro's opening act at the time.<ref>Kort, Michele. ''Soul Picnic: The Music and Passion of Laura Nyro''. New York: St. Martin's Press, p. 122-123.</ref>

Nyro married Vietnam War veteran David Bianchini in October 1971<ref>Lawson, Dawn. [http://www.anb.org/articles/18/18-03520.html "Nyro, Laura"],
''American National Biography Online'' June 2000 Update. Retrieved July 31, 2014.</ref> after a whirlwind romance and spent the next three years living with him in a small town in Massachusetts. The marriage ended after three years, during which time she had grown accustomed to rural life, as opposed to the life in the city, where she had recorded her first five records.

After Nyro split from Bianchini in 1975, she suffered the trauma of the death of her mother Gilda to ovarian cancer at the age of 49. She consoled herself largely by recording a new album, enlisting [[Charles Calello|Charlie Calello]], with whom she had collaborated on ''Eli and the Thirteenth Confession''.

In 1978, a short-lived relationship with Harindra Singh produced a son, Gil Bianchini (also known as musician Gil-T), whom she gave the surname of her ex-husband.

In the early 1980s, Nyro began living with painter [[Maria Desiderio]] (1954–1999),<ref>Connecticut Department of Health. ''Connecticut Death Index, 1949–2001'' [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2003.</ref> a relationship that lasted 17 years, the rest of Nyro's life.

Nyro was a [[Feminism|feminist]] and openly discussed it on a number of occasions, once saying, "I may bring a certain feminist perspective to my songwriting, because that's how I see life."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cwhf.org/inductees/arts-humanities/laura-nyro/ |title=Laura Nyro &#124; Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame |publisher=Cwhf.org |access-date=November 17, 2013 |archive-date=October 26, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026182715/http://www.cwhf.org/inductees/arts-humanities/laura-nyro |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/laura-nyro/bio/ |title=Laura Nyro Biography &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |access-date=November 17, 2013}}</ref>

By the late 1980s, Nyro had become an [[animal rights activist]] and [[vegetarian]], and began to offer literature on the subject at her concerts.<ref>{{cite book|access-date=12 August 2018|title=Soul Picnic: The Music and Passion of Laura Nyro|first=Michele |last=Kort|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|date=10 May 2016|isbn=978-1250122612|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=48TVCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT283|pages=283–284, 290|quote=Around the same time, Nyro also decided to become a vegetarian. [...] by that time [1988], she had decided she wouldn't eat anything that had a face, let alone a creature that she loved. [...] her staunch support of animal rights led her to offer literature about various organizations at her concerts, [...]}}</ref>

===Death===
In late 1996, Nyro, like her mother, was diagnosed with [[ovarian cancer]]. After the diagnosis, [[Columbia Records]], with Nyro's involvement, prepared a two-CD retrospective of material from her years at the label. She lived to see the release of ''[[Stoned Soul Picnic: The Best of Laura Nyro]]'' in 1997.

She died of ovarian cancer in [[Danbury, Connecticut]], on April 8, 1997, at 49,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Holden|first1=Stephen|title=Laura Nyro, Intense Balladeer Of 60's and 70's, Dies at 49|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/10/arts/laura-nyro-intense-balladeer-of-60-s-and-70-s-dies-at-49.html|access-date=March 9, 2015|date=April 10, 1997}}</ref> the same age at which her mother died.

===Posthumous releases===
Nyro's posthumous releases include ''Angel In The Dark'' (2001), which includes her final studio recordings made in 1994 and 1995, and ''The Loom's Desire'' (2002), a set of live recordings with solo piano and harmony singers from ''The Bottom Line'' Christmas shows of 1993 and 1994.

===Influence===
Nyro's influence on popular musicians has also been acknowledged by such artists as [[Joni Mitchell]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Joni Mitchell|last=Bego|first=Mark|date=2005-05-26|publisher=Taylor Trade Publications|isbn=9781589792210|pages=318|language=en}}</ref> [[Carole King]],<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2017/apr/19/laura-nyro-songwriter-passion-and-soul |title=The passion and soul of Laura Nyro |last=Barton |first=Laura |author-link=Laura Barton |date=2017-04-19 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |language=en |access-date=2021-05-06}}</ref> [[Tori Amos]],<ref name=":0" /> [[Patti Smith]], [[Kate Bush]], [[Diamanda Galas]], [[Bette Midler]],<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/spotlight-central/i-thought-i-was-listening-to-laura-nyro-d1ed24ac030e|title="I Thought I Was Listening to Laura Nyro!"

[[Cyndi Lauper]] acknowledged that her rendition of the song "[[Walk On By (song)|Walk On By]]", on her [[Grammy Award]]-nominated 2003 cover album ''[[At Last (Cyndi Lauper album)|At Last]]'', was inspired by Nyro.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMaM42nLLSc | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211107/CMaM42nLLSc| archive-date=2021-11-07 | url-status=live|title=Cyndi Lauper - Promo do DVD "At Last" (Legendado) |publisher=YouTube |date=June 9, 2009 |access-date=November 17, 2013}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

[[Elton John]] and [[Elvis Costello]] discussed Nyro's influence on both of them during the premiere episode of Costello's interview show [[Spectacle: Elvis Costello with...|''Spectacle'']]. When asked by the host if he could name three great performer/songwriters who have largely been ignored, John cited Nyro as one of his choices. He also addressed Nyro's influence on his 1970 song "[[Burn Down the Mission]]", from ''[[Tumbleweed Connection]]'', in particular. "I idolized her," he concluded. "The soul, the passion, just the out and out audacity of the way her rhythmic and melody changes came was like nothing I've heard before."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sundancechannel.com/spectacle/episodes |title=Series – Sundance Channel |publisher=Sundancechannel.com |date=August 13, 2013 |access-date=November 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615164437/http://www.sundancechannel.com/spectacle/episodes/ |archive-date=June 15, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Bruce Arnold, leader of the pioneering soft rock group [[Orpheus (band)|Orpheus]], was a fan of Nyro's music. They both worked with legendary studio drummer [[Bernard Purdie]]. While recording with Purdie, Arnold mentioned his love of Nyro's music, and the drummer responded with a story about Nyro: At Nyro's home one night in the late 1970s, Purdie mentioned that he was the uncredited drummer for [[Orpheus (band)|Orpheus]]. Nyro got excited and brought him into a room where she kept her record collection. She pulled out well-worn copies of every Orpheus LP, as well as copies sealed for posterity.

[[Diane Paulus]] and [[Bruce Buschel]] co-created ''Eli's Comin''', a musical revue of the songs of Nyro, which, among others, starred [[Anika Noni Rose]].

[[Louis Greenstein]] and [[Kate Ferber]] wrote "One Child Born: The Music of Laura Nyro," a one-woman show featuring Ferber and directed by Adrienne Campbell-Holt. "One Child Born" was developed at [[Collaborative Arts Project 21 (CAP21)|CAP21]] in [[New York City]] and has sold out [[Joe's Pub]] and the [[Laurie Beechman Theatre]] in New York, [[World Cafe (radio program)#World Cafe Live|World Cafe Live]] in [[Philadelphia]], and other venues.<ref>{{cite web |title=Return Engagement |url=https://americanrepertorytheater.org/shows-events/return-engagement-one-child-born-the-music-of-laura-nyro/ |website=A.R.T.

The [[Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater]] and the National Ballet of Canada have also included her music in their performances; notably, "Been On A Train" from ''Christmas and the Beads of Sweat'', in which a woman describes watching her lover die from a drug overdose, comprises the second movement of Ailey's 1971 solo for [[Judith Jamison]], ''Cry''.  Alvin Ailey choreographed  ''Quintet'' in 1968 with 5 female members of his troupe dancing to several of Laura's songs from the first two albums.

On October 2, 2007, three-time Tony nominee [[Judy Kuhn]] released her new album ''Serious Playground: The Songs of Laura Nyro''. The album, which debuted as a concert to a sold-out house at Lincoln Center's American Songbook Series in January 2007, includes several of Nyro's biggest hits ("Stoned Soul Picnic", "Stoney End") as well as some of her lesser known gems.

In 1992, English shoegaze/Britpop band [[Lush (band)|Lush]] released a song about Laura Nyro ("Laura") on their first full-length album ''[[Spooky (album)|Spooky]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eyesore.no/html/interview/Lush.interview.kirkcaldie.html |title=Lush: Emma Anderson interviewed |publisher=Eyesore.no |date=August 7, 1994 |access-date=November 17, 2013}}</ref> Several of the band's songs (specifically those written by [[Emma Anderson]]) have echoed Nyro's music in their titles – "When I Die", "Single Girl". More recently, in 2012, Anderson has referred to Laura Nyro as "wondrous" on her Twitter account.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/evjanderson/status/268059438877925376 |title=Twitter / evjanderson: Please sign to save the Union |publisher=Twitter.com |access-date=November 17, 2013}}</ref>

[[Jenny Lewis]] of [[Rilo Kiley]], when promoting her 2006 solo album ''[[Rabbit Fur Coat]]'' repeatedly cited Nyro's 1971 album ''[[Gonna Take a Miracle]]'' as a big influence on her music. Lewis performed the first track on that album "I Met Him on a Sunday" on the Rabbit Fur Coat tour.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Barnett |first1=Laura |title=Jenny Lewis: soundtrack of my life |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/19/jenny-lewis-soundtrack-of-my-life-interview-voyager-rilo-kiley |access-date=30 November 2021 |work=Guardian |agency=Guardian News & Media Limited |date=19 Sep 2014}}</ref>

In the 2004 drama film ''[[A Home at the End of the World (film)|A Home at the End of the World]]'' can be heard Nyro's recordings of "Désiree" and "It's Gonna Take a Miracle", both songs from the album ''[[Gonna Take a Miracle]]''.

[[Paul Shaffer]], bandleader for the CBS Orchestra and sidekick on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', stated that his desert island album would be ''[[Eli and the Thirteenth Confession]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_xIcrP_YXw | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211107/7_xIcrP_YXw| archive-date=2021-11-07 | url-status=live|title=Paul Shaffer |publisher=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

===Biographies, analyses and tributes===
On October 27, 1997, a large-scale tribute concert was produced by women at the [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]] in New York. Performers included [[Rickie Lee Jones]], [[Sandra Bernhard]], [[Toshi Reagon]], and [[Phoebe Snow]].

''And a World To Carry On'', an original tribute show celebrating the music and life of Laura Nyro, written by Barry Silber and Carole Coppinger, was first performed in 2008 (2nd performance late August 2015) at Carrollwood Players Theatre in Tampa, Fla.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://carrollwoodplayers.org/a-world-to-carry-on-laura-nyro-remembered/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 13, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713181151/http://carrollwoodplayers.org/a-world-to-carry-on-laura-nyro-remembered/ |archive-date=July 13, 2015 }}</ref>

''To Carry On'', an original tribute show celebrating the music and life of Laura Nyro, starring Mimi Cohen, is in its second return engagement as of January 19, 2011, at Cherry Lane Theatre in Manhattan.

A biography of Nyro, ''Soul Picnic: The Music and Passion of Laura Nyro'', written by [[Michele Kort]], was published in 2002 by Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Press.

An analysis of Nyro's music by music theorist Ari Shagal was written at the University of Chicago in 2003, linking Nyro's work to the [[Great American Songbook]] by demonstrating the similarities between her chordal language and those of [[Harold Arlen]], [[Harry Warren]], and [[George Shearing]].

Nyro's life and music were celebrated in a 2005 [[BBC Radio 2]] documentary, ''Shooting Star&nbsp;– Laura Nyro Remembered'', which was narrated by her friend [[Bette Midler]] and included contributions from her one-time manager [[David Geffen]], co-producers [[Arif Mardin]] and [[Gary Katz]], and performers [[Suzanne Vega]] and [[Janis Ian]]. It was rebroadcast on April 4, 2006.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/02_february/27/nyro.shtml |title=Bette Midler pays tribute to Laura Nyro |publisher=BBC  |date=February 27, 2005 |access-date=December 7, 2008}}</ref>

[[Janis Ian]], who attended the High School of Music and Art in New York at the same time as Nyro, discussed her friendship with Nyro during the late 1960s in her autobiography, ''Society's Child''. Ian described her as looking like a "[[Morticia Addams]]" caricature with her long, dark hair, and called her a "brilliant songwriter" but "oddly inarticulate" in terms of musical terminology. Ian was a fan of Nyro's work with producer [[Charlie Calello]] and chose him as the producer of her 1969 album ''Who Really Cares'' on the basis of his work with Nyro.<ref>Ian, Janis. ''Society's Child: My Autobiography.'' New York: Tarcher, 2008, p. 99.</ref>

Comedian, writer, and singer [[Sandra Bernhard]] has spoken extensively of Laura Nyro as an ongoing inspiration. She dedicated a song, "The Woman I Could've Been" on ''[[Excuses for Bad Behavior (Part One)]]'', to her. She also sang Nyro's "I Never Meant to Hurt You" in her film ''[[Without You I'm Nothing (film)|Without You I'm Nothing]]''.

[[Rickie Lee Jones]]'s album ''[[Pirates (album)|Pirates]]'' and songs such as "We Belong Together" and "Living It Up" are reminiscent of early Laura Nyro songs, and Jones acknowledged Nyro's influence.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pinnock |first1=Tom |title=Rickie Lee Jones on the music that shaped her: “I was enchanted!” |url=https://www.uncut.co.uk/features/interviews/rickie-lee-jones-on-the-music-that-shaped-her-i-was-enchanted-121735/ |website=Uncut |publisher=NME Networks |access-date=30 November 2021}}</ref>  In her memoir, ''Last Chance Texaco'',<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Last-Chance-Texaco/Rickie-Lee-Jones/9781797129969|title=Last Chance Texaco|date=2021-04-13|isbn=978-1-7971-2996-9|language=en}}</ref> Jones describes discovering Nyro's music in the summer of 1970, saying “Somehow, the moment I fell in love with Laura I loved myself just a little more. I believe an invisible cord came out of me and attached itself to Laura Nyro that summer. Or vice versa.”<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-10-01|title=Stuff I've Been Reading: Rickie Lee Jones, Emma Dabiri, and More|url=https://believermag.com/stuff-ive-been-reading-nick-hornby/|access-date=2021-11-20|website=Believer Magazine|language=en-US}}</ref>

[[Todd Rundgren]] has also acknowledged the strong influence of Nyro's 1960s music on his own songwriting. While a member of the pop group [[Nazz]], his great admiration for Nyro led him to arrange a meeting with her (which took place shortly after she had recorded the ''[[Eli and the Thirteenth Confession]]'' LP). Nyro invited Rundgren to become the musical director of her backing group, but his commitments to [[Nazz]] obliged him to decline. Rundgren's debut solo album ''[[Runt (album)|Runt]]'' (1970) includes the strongly Nyro-influenced "Baby Let's Swing" which was written about her and mentions her by name. Rundgren and Nyro remained friends for much of her professional career and he subsequently assisted her with the recording of her album ''[[Mother's Spiritual]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.puremusic.com/todd3.html |title=Todd Rundgren (p.3) |publisher=Puremusic.com |access-date=November 17, 2013}}</ref>

On April 14, 2012, Laura Nyro was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. The induction speech was delivered by singer [[Bette Midler]] and the award was accepted by her son, [[Gil Bianchini]]. The song "[[Stoney End (song)|Stoney End]]" was performed by singer [[Sara Bareilles]] at the induction ceremony.<ref name="wsj"/>

A [[hybrid (botany)|hybrid]] [[daylily]] named for Laura Nyro was introduced in 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.daylilies.org/DaylilyDB/detail.php?id=46941|title=AHS Daylily Cultivar Detailed Information|website=Daylilies.org}}</ref>

The Scottish band [[Cosmic Rough Riders]] released a tribute song, "Laura Nyro," on their 2001 album ''Pure Escapism''.

The song "Mean Streets" by the band [[Tennis (band)|Tennis]] is a tribute to Nyro.

[[Kanye West]] sampled Nyro on his [[Graduation (album)#Critical reception|widely acclaimed]] 2007 album ''[[Graduation (album)|Graduation]]''.

On July 22, 2014, composer/arranger [[Billy Childs]] released ''[[Map to the Treasure: Reimagining Laura Nyro]]''. The album features ten Laura Nyro songs performed by a long list of stars including [[Rickie Lee Jones]], [[Shawn Colvin]], [[Alison Krauss]], [[Dianne Reeves]], and [[Wayne Shorter]]. The album was nominated for three Grammys, with the "[[New York Tendaberry (song)|New York Tendaberry]]" track featuring [[Renee Fleming]] and [[Yo-Yo Ma]] winning for Best Arrangement, Instrumental and Vocals.

In 2015, The Christine Spero Group released "Spero Plays Nyro", the Music of Laura Nyro along with a highly acclaimed live tour. The album features eleven of Nyro's songs and an original song, "Laura and John" by Christine Spero, a tribute to Laura Nyro and John Coltrane, whom Nyro admired. This was evidenced in the lyrics of her song "The Roll of the Ocean" ("I want Coltrane in the moon
Just that starry aching tune
Will do").
