==History==

===Formation===
The group originally formed as '''Drowned''' in 1996 when many of the band were just 14 years old.<ref name="AMG"/> The members of the band at that time were [[Dave McPherson (musician)|Dave McPherson]] as guitarist / vocalist, Joe Morgan as bassist / backing vocalist and Simon Taylor as drummer. They played several local venues, getting their first interviews and airplay on Brentwood-based [[radio station]], [[Phoenix FM]]. They recorded many unreleased tracks such as "acid drop" and "apricot"  The band scored their break when a scout from [[Music for Nations|MFN]] caught the end of one of their sets, whilst attending a gig to see another band. They signed with [[Music For Nations|MFN]] in 2001, and changed their name to InMe to avoid confusion with Drowned, an [[United States|American]] [[Christian rock]] band of the same name.<ref name="AMG"/>

===Overgrown Eden (2001–2003)===
''[[Overgrown Eden]]'' was released through [[Music for Nations]] in January 2003, after numerous delays.<ref name="AMG"/> It reached No.&nbsp;15 in the [[UK Albums Chart]],<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

[[Music for Nations]] went out of business during 2004,<ref name="AMG"/> when they were absorbed into a parent company. During this time the rights for ''Overgrown Eden'' were lost, and because of this, the album was eventually re-released in June 2006 when those rights were re-obtained. InMe played ''Overgrown Eden'' in its entirety in two separate dates in November 2010 as a part of a greatest hits tour to support their "best-of" album ''Phoenix: The Best Of InMe''. The London show was recorded and was initially intended to be released through [[Sony BMG]] as a part of a re-release of [[Overgrown Eden]]. The DVD was eventually released through Graphite Records in 2012 along with the band's 5th Album ''[[The Pride (InMe album)|The Pride]]''.

===White Butterfly (2004-2005)===
Their second album, ''[[White Butterfly (album)|White Butterfly]]'', was released on 20 June 2005. It was released in two forms in the UK, a standard edition with thirteen tracks, and a [[limited edition]] with two [[bonus track]]s "Every Whisper Aches" and "Angels with Snipers".<ref name="AMG"/> The first single from ''White Butterfly'' was "Faster The Chase" in 2004, when the band were still with MFN. Before the release of the album, there was a leak where several tracks, due to be released for the first time on the album were downloaded. The first in-store single to be released on the new label was "7 Weeks" which reached No.&nbsp;36 in the UK chart, whilst the second single, "So You Know", peaked at No.&nbsp;33.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> The release of ''White Butterfly'' was sandwiched between a tour of the UK. ''White Butterfly'' was produced by [[Josh Abraham]] and [[Colin Richardson]].

The band released a [[double A-side]] download single "White Butterfly" / "Safe In a Room" on 19 December 2005, with a five track live [[Extended play|EP]].

''White Butterfly'' was played in its entirety at two of InMe's shows on their greatest hits tour in November 2010.

In September 2007, InMe released their third album ''[[Daydream Anonymous]]''.<ref name="AMG"/> It charted in the UK at No.&nbsp;71, making it the lowest charting InMe album to date. ''Daydream Anonymous'' featured thirteen tracks. "I Won't Let Go" was released as the only single. ''Daydream Anonymous'' was played in its entirety on two nights of InMe's greatest hits tour in December.

A [[double A-side]] single "All Terrain Vehicle" / "Nova Armada" was released in June 2010, with an accompanying video for "Nova Armada". Marlow's first recording with the band was with him playing second guitar on an acoustic version of "Nova Armada".
