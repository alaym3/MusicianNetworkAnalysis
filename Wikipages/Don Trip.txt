== Introduction ==

Cee Lo Green) - Single by Don Trip on Apple Music|website=iTunes|language=en|access-date=2017-05-16}}</ref> This eventually led to his signing to [[Interscope Records|Interscope]] in 2012,<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=http://djbooth.net/news/entry/don-trip-in-mix-0117121|title=Don Trip Jumps "In the Mix" [DJBooth Interview Exclusive] - DJBooth Article|work=DJBooth.net|access-date=2017-05-16}}</ref> and being named an [[XXL (magazine)|XXL Freshman]] later that year.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=http://www.stereogum.com/962771/xxl-freshman-class-of-2012/franchises/list/|title=XXL Freshman Class Of 2012|date=2012-02-28|work=Stereogum|access-date=2017-05-16}}</ref> After being dropped from the label, he managed to find further success as an independent artist with his critically acclaimed series of mixtapes titled Step Brothers, in collaboration with fellow Tennessee rapper [[Starlito]].

== Early life ==
As a child, Don Trip grew up in the low-income [[East Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee|East Memphis]].<ref name=":0" /> Living in a fatherless household, Trip watched as his mother worked three jobs, and still struggled to support him along with his brother and sister. At the age of 12, he began working to provide for his siblings, saying that "all we ever had was us."<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/features/don-trip-interview/57046/|title=Don Trip: 'Help Is On the Way' (Interview) - Prefixmag.com|last=sasheezy|work=Prefixmag.com|access-date=2017-05-16|language=en-US}}</ref> Even at an early age, though, Don Trip was inspired by [[Jay Z|Jay-Z]] and [[Tupac Shakur|Tupac]], and even studied [[Jadakiss]] verses with an almost religious fervor.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2011/09/21/interview-don-trip|title=Interview: Don Trip|website=The FADER|access-date=2017-05-16}}</ref> At 15, he noticed his family was falling apart, and felt the urge to do something more to help them. Inspired by the pre-teen duo of [[Kris Kross|Kriss Kross]], he began rapping and making music.<ref name=":3" />

== Career ==

=== Early Career - 2012 ===

Don Trip's career began at 15, when he started rapping.<ref name=":3" /> After working on his craft, he began to release mixtapes and singles in very late 2000s, leading to a string of 9 projects being released between October 2010 (Crossface Crippler)<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://mrdontrip.bandcamp.com/album/crossface-crippler|title=Crossface Crippler, by Mr. Don Trip|website=Mr. Don Trip|access-date=2017-05-16}}</ref> and February 2012 (Guerilla).<ref name=":6">{{Citation|title=Don Trip - Guerilla (Hosted by DJ Drama) {{!}} Download & Listen [New Mixtape]|url=http://hotnewhiphop.com/don-trip-guerilla-hosted-by-dj-drama-mixtape.45857.html|accessdate=2017-05-16}}</ref> Releasing his mixtapes on websites such as [[DatPiff|Datpiff]] and HotNewHipHop, Don Trip began to amass a following as a street rapper. However, his song "Letter to My Son," (originally released in 2009) went semi-viral on [[YouTube]], fueling his transition toward mainstream hip-hop.<ref name=":4" /> The song, which detailed Trip's struggle with being unable to see his son due to  court ruling, was lauded for its accurate depiction of a hardship not often portrayed in rap music. In 2012, hot on the heels of "Letter to My Son," Don Trip was named one of XXL's 2012 freshmen, alongside [[Future (rapper)|Future]], [[Danny Brown]], [[Hopsin]], and more.<ref name=":2" /> Soon after, he was signed to Epidemic Records, a joint enterprise between production duo [[Cool & Dre]] and Interscope Records.<ref name=":1" />

=== Step Brothers - Present ===

Prior to his signing at Interscope, Don Trip scored big with his collaborative [[Step Brothers (duo)|Step Brothers]] mixtape with Starlito.<ref name="Step Brothers, by Mr. Don Trip">{{Cite web|url=https://mrdontrip.bandcamp.com/album/step-brothers-2|title=Step Brothers, by Mr. Don Trip|website=Mr. Don Trip|access-date=2017-05-16}}</ref> Released in 2011, the mixtape was peppered with references and in-jokes relating to the [[Judd Apatow]] movie [[Step Brothers (film)|Step Brothers]], and gained a cult following among the rap community. A few months before the mixtape's release, Starlito and Don Trip were introduced to each other by [[Yo Gotti]], with whom Don Trip was touring.<ref name=":4" /> Both rappers were already familiar with the other's music, and after discovering their musical compatibility, decided to make a joint project.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/microphonecheck/2014/01/15/262088432/starlito-and-don-trip-writers-first-rappers-second|title=Starlito And Don Trip: Writers First, Rappers Second|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-05-16|language=en}}</ref> Three studio sessions later, Step Brothers was fully recorded. Due to the success of the mixtape as well as their collaborative chemistry, Starlito and Don Trip continued to collaborate, releasing the Step Brothers 2 mixtape in 2015.<ref name=":7">{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/step-brothers-two/id720272062|title=Step Brothers Two by Starlito & Don Trip on Apple Music|website=iTunes|language=en|access-date=2017-05-16}}</ref> While Don Trip was based in Memphis while Starlito was based in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], the two continued to meet up to record, never emailing each other songs back and forth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/10/starlito-don-trip-interview|title=Interview: A Discussion With Starlito and Don Trip On Independence, the Evolving Industry, and "Step Brothers 2"|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2017-05-16}}</ref> Eventually, in 2017, the two linked up again for the third installment of the Step Brothers series,<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/step-brothers-three/id1211484765|title=Step Brothers THREE by Starlito & Don Trip on Apple Music|website=iTunes|language=en|access-date=2017-05-16}}</ref> preceded by the Karate in the Garage collaborative mixtape.<ref name="hotnewhiphop.com">{{Citation|title=Starlito & Don Trip - Step Brothers (Karate In The Garage) {{!}} Download & Listen [New Mixtape]|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/starlito-and-don-trip-step-brothers-karate-in-the-garage-new-mixtape.116852.html|accessdate=2017-05-16}}</ref> Released independently, like the two previous mixtapes, Step Brothers 3 received widespread critical acclaim from publications such as [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23047-starlito-don-trip-step-brothers-three/|title=Starlito / Don Trip: Step Brothers THREE Album Review {{!}} Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-16}}</ref> [[XXL (magazine)|XXL]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/reviews/2017/04/starlito-don-trip-step-brothers-3-album-review/|title=Starlito and Don Trip Deliver a Dose of Reality Rap With 'Step Brothers Three' - XXL|website=XXL Mag|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-16}}</ref> and [[USA Today]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2017/04/05/step-brothers-3-don-trip-starlito-memphis-nashville/99829178/|title='Step Brothers 3': Don Trip, Starlito continue Memphis/Nashville union|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2017-05-16|language=en}}</ref>
