Her 1997 debut single, "[[Love You Down]]," was a cover of [[Ready for the World]]'s 1986 hit. INOJ reached number 25 in the United States with her version. Her 1998 debut album was also named ''[[Ready for the World (album)|Ready for the World]]''.

She also released a version of [[Anita Ward]]'s "[[Ring My Bell]]".

==Early career==
INOJ was born in [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. As baby, she started singing [[War (American band)|War's]] "[[The Cisco Kid (song)|The Cisco Kid]]" in her crib before she was talking.<ref name=Taylor1998>{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GwoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA96 |page=96 |title=Ingénue INOJ Follows Her Instincts As 'Time After Time' Clicks At Top 40 |last=Taylor |first=Chuck |date=September 19, 1998 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=110 |number=38 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref> She sang in the high school choir.<ref name=AllMusic>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/inoj-mn0000092189/biography |title=INOJ Biography |last=Phares |first=Heather |website=AllMusic |access-date=February 6, 2021}}</ref> She wanted to have a singing career, but her parents convinced her to pursue engineering, another passion. She decided to attend the [[University of Baltimore]] because it was near Washington, D.C. and not too far from New York City, and she had a better chance of connecting with music producers. In her sophomore year of college, she joined a girl group called Spellbound, who got signed to a major label recording contract. The group disbanded, and she became a songwriter.<ref name=Brooks>{{cite web |last=Brooks |first=Crispin |date=November 17, 2020 |title=Interviews: INOJ |website=Planet Thirty |url=https://planetthirty.com/inoj/ |access-date=February 6, 2021}}</ref>

She was asked by [[So So Def]] producers to sing a reference track for someone else to hear and emulate, and she recorded her vocals to "[[Love You Down]]". The producers immediately put her version out as the final product. At this time, she created her stage name INOJ, pronounced "eye know jay". The name is "Joni" spelled backwards; her birth name is Ayanna and she had been nicknamed Yanni, but she spelled the nickname ''Joni'' for personal style.<ref name=Brooks/>

==Musical style==
When discussing her musical style in an interview with [[Billboard magazine|''Billboard'']], INOJ stated that she doesn't identify with one particular genre of music.<ref name=genre>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GwoEAAAAMBAJ&q=inoj&pg=PA96|title=Ingenue INOJ Follows Her Instincts As "Time After Time" Clicks At Top 40 |work=[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]|page=96|date=September 19, 1998|accessdate=October 31, 2019}}</ref> According to her " I try not to classify my sound, but I think I would call myself rhythm and pop instead of R&B". She continued saying, "R&B is more street today than rhythm and blues, and i'm definitely not urban, so I guess i've come up with a new category of my own."<ref name=genre/>

INOJ said she was raised listening to artists such as [[the Carpenters]] and [[Sandy Patty]].<ref name=genre/> She is influenced by artists [[Minnie Riperton]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Backstreet Boys]], [[NSYNC]], [[Shania Twain]], [[Shawn Colvin]] and [[Aaliyah]].<ref name=genre/>
