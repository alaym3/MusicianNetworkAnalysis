==History==
===Beginnings, ''Stay Up, Get Down'', and ''The Way We Talk'' (2006–2007)===
Bassist Garrett Nickelsen and drummer Patrick Kirch had been playing in local bands together, and when one of them disbanded in 2006, they opted to start over with a new name and sound. Singer John O'Callaghan joined soon after auditions - with no prior vocal experience - along with guitarists Alex Ross and Ryan Osterman, officially forming The Maine in January 2007.<ref name="The Maine formation">{{Cite web|url=http://www.youthradio.org/news/music-the-maine|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130629091653/http://www.youthradio.org/news/music-the-maine|url-status=dead|title=Music: The Maine |website=Youthradio.org|archive-date=June 29, 2013}}</ref> Together, they released the EP ''[[Stay Up, Get Down EP|Stay Up, Get Down]]''. Months later Osterman left the band and was replaced by Kennedy Brock, and Alex Ross was replaced by Jared Monaco. The Maine signed to [[Fearless Records]] and on December 11, 2007, they debuted a five-song EP entitled ''[[The Way We Talk EP|The Way We Talk]]'', produced by [[Matt Grabe]].<ref name="allmusic2007">{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/matt-grabe-p847773/credits | title=Matt Grabe - AllMusic | publisher=Rovi Corporation | work=AllMusic | year=2007 | access-date=November 9, 2011}}</ref>

Furthermore, in July, the band performed on the [[Vans Warped Tour]], a popular touring music festival.

===''Black and White'' (2009–2011)===
On July 13, 2010, The Maine released its second full-length album, ''[[Black and White (The Maine Album)|Black & White]],'' produced by [[Howard Benson]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/howard-benson-p55948/credits/date-asc/300 | title=Howard Benson - AllMusic | publisher=Rovi Corporation | work=AllMusic | year=2010 | access-date=November 9, 2011}}</ref> In November 2010, while on the Harmony tour, The Maine and [[Never Shout Never]] had fans gather canned foods to help those in need. As a 'thank you' gift, both acts released a split EP titled ''Split - EP''. On December 27, 2010, The Maine released the short film "[[In Darkness and in Light]]" on [[iTunes]].

The band embarked on their first headlining tour in 2010, ''An Evening with The Maine''.

In February 2011, The Maine set off on an international tour that began in the Philippines.

===''Forever Halloween'' and ''Imaginary Numbers'' (2013–2014)===
On April 12, 2013, the band announced that their fourth studio album ''[[Forever Halloween]]'' would be released on June 4, 2013. The album was released independently in the US in partnership with their management team 8123, via Universal Music in Canada, and Rude Records in Europe, UK, Australia and Japan. It sold over 10,000 copies in its first week, debuting at number 39 on the Billboard 200.<ref name="The Maine Billboard Chart History">{{cite web|url=https://www.wesrch.com/afterhours/paper-details/press-paper-AF1AEH000OTOV-another-addition-to-the-maine-8123-fest-lineup|title=8123 Fest by The Maine|access-date=25 June 2013}}</ref>

On November 5, 2013, The Maine announced online that they would be releasing a five-song acoustic EP titled ''[[Imaginary Numbers (The Maine EP)|Imaginary Numbers]]'' on December 12, 2013. The first song from the EP, "Raining in Paris" was released November 5 via YouTube with a lyric video.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lozwVvEtgfw |title=The Maine &#124; Raining In Paris (Official Lyric Video) |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2013-11-05 |access-date=2016-08-07}}</ref> ''Imaginary Numbers'' was released on December 10, 2013.

The Maine later released a deluxe edition of Forever Halloween on June 17, 2014, containing five new tracks.

===''American Candy'' (2015–2016)===
The band released their fifth studio album, ''[[American Candy]]'', on March 31, 2015. The first single from the album, ''English Girls'', dropped February 11, 2015 with a debut at #17 on the iTunes Alternative Chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popvortex.com/music/charts/top-alternative-songs.php#chart-position-10 |title=iTunes Top 100 Alternative Songs 2016 |website=Popvortex.com |access-date=2016-08-07}}</ref>
The second single from the album, "Miles Away" debuted at #16 on the iTunes Alternative Chart on March 10, 2015. 
''Verity Magazine'' infers, "Miles Away" is a more relaxed and laid back track, but nonetheless, you'll still want to get up and dance. The last song they released, "English Girls" was very upbeat and just spilling positive vibes, which is quite a stark contrast to their slower and darker previous album Forever Halloween. From the two tracks released so far, this album is sounding more like older albums from The Maine like Pioneer and Black and White".  "Same Suit, Different Tie" was released via SoundCloud the day before the album was set to release. In order to celebrate the release of the album, The Maine hosted "24 Hours of American Candy", where they live streamed their activities on the release day of ''American Candy''.

The tour for this album took place in Spring 2015 with [[Real Friends (band)|Real Friends]] and [[Knuckle Puck]] and The Technicolors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/the_band_made_this_record_just_for_the_fansamerican_candy_producer_talks_th |title="The band made this record just for the fans"—'American Candy' producer talks the Maine, progression - News - Alternative Press |website=Altpress.com |date=2015-02-05 |access-date=2016-08-07}}</ref> The band were also on the main stage for the entirety of the 2016 Vans Warped Tour, announcing that this would be their last tour before they headed into the studio to record their sixth studio album, scheduled for release in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=JOHN + GARRETT FROM THE MAINE TALK ABOUT BEING A BAND FOR A DECADE & PLANS FOR UPCOMING ALBUM|url=http://celebsecrets.com/2016/09/01/john-garrett-from-the-maine-talk-about-being-a-band-for-a-decade-plans-for-upcoming-album|publisher=WordPress|access-date=2 September 2016}}</ref>
