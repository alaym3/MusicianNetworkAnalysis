== History ==

=== Formation (2013) ===
Orbit Culture was formed with the idea of the vocalist and rhythm guitarist Niklas Karlsson and ex-guitarist Maximilian Zinsmeister. They met each other through mutual friends at the age of 17 and decided to create a small group. They hired a small rehearsal place in an old power plant station. At that time, Maximilian was currently playing with another local band called Abstract Noise and he recruited Orbit Culture's fellow drummer Markus Bladh and later, Christoffer Olsson joined to play bass guitar.<ref>{{cite web |url=  https://www.moshville.co.uk/feature/botd/2020/08/band-of-the-day-orbit-culture/|title= Band of the Day: Orbit Culture|publisher= The Moshville Times |date= 7 August 2020}}</ref>

=== ''Odyssey'' (2013) ===
Shortly after the band's formation, Karlsson started to write songs for their debut EP and the band spent most of the summer of 2013 recording, mixing, and producing their first set of songs, ''Odyssey''. The production ended on 17 August 2013, and ''Odyssey'' was released shortly after.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.revolvermag.com/music/meet-orbit-culture-small-town-swedes-grand-vision-inspired-metallica-gojira |title= Meet Orbit Culture, Small-Town Swedes With Grand Vision Inspired by Metallica, Gojira|publisher=Revolver Magazine|date= 5 May 2020}}</ref> In December that year, the band released the [[remaster]]ed version of their EP with new artwork and the instrumental versions of the songs. The band and their EP gained local interest and they performed their first shows in their hometown.

=== ''In Medias Res'' (2014) ===
After positive feedback towards ''Odyssey'', the band started production on their first full-length album and released ''In Medias Res'' on 23 July 2014. They released a music video for the song "Obscurity" on 31 October 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://metalstorm.net/bands/biography.php?band_id=9850&bandname=Orbit+Culture|title= Orbit Culture – Biography |publisher=Metal Storm|date= 8 August 2020}}</ref>

=== Maximilian's departure and ''Rasen'' (2016) ===
After promoting ''In Medias Res'' through multiple live shows, Zinsmeister decided to leave the band shortly after to focus on his academic studies. The band had teased on social media images and videos of them working on a second full-length album, and on 11 March 2016, their second full-length album ''Rasen'' was released. On 25 August 2016, the band released their second music video "Sun of All", which has reached almost 600,000 plays on [[YouTube]]. Karlsson commented that things started to heat up in the underground metal community for them after this video.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://distortedsoundmag.com/orbit-culture-finding-their-formula/|title=Orbit Culture: Finding Their Formula |publisher=Distorted Sound Magazine|date= 27 September 2020}}</ref>
