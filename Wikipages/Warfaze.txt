They are considered to be one of the pioneering [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band in Bangladesh. Multiple changes have taken place in membership after its founding since 1984. Since their inception, the band has released eight albums, including seven studio albums and one compilation album. In addition, they have released several singles in band mixed albums and one Lalon Tribute album.

The band has experimented with different subgenres of [[hard rock music|hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] over the years like [[Progressive Metal]]. The Band adapting the styles of Western rock and heavy metal sound led the band's establish a new flavor of Bangla music.

==History==

=== First decade and breakthrough – ''[[Warfaze (album)|Warfaze]]'' and ''অবাক ভালোবাসা'' (Astonishing Love) (1984–94) ===

The first lineup of Warfaze in 1984 consisted Bappi on vocals, Mir and Naimul on guitars, Kamal on bass, Helal on drums. This initial line-up underwent the first of many changes with Helal, Mir, and Bappi having to leave the band for personal reasons. By that time Kamal met Tipu early 1986 and Tipu joined Warfaze as the drummer and co-founder. The band was far from breaking through to the mainstream music scene in Bangladesh. Heavy metal music was not much popular in Bangladesh back then.<ref name="Warfaze Biography">{{cite web|title=Warfaze Biography|url=http://banglamusic.com/artists/warfaze/|publisher=banglamusic.com|access-date=29 March 2013}}</ref>

In 1986, Kamal took up lead guitar duties, Sheikh Monirul Alam Tipu as drummer, and Kamal and Tipu took Babna Karim as the bassist, and Reshad as the vocalist. This second line up had to be discontinued when Naimul emigrated to the US. At that time, there were three other Dhaka-based metal bands: [[Rockstrata]], In Dhaka, and Aces. Mashuk Rahman from in Dhaka and Fuad from Aces volunteered to help Warfaze as guest members (guitarist) and Warfaze introduced Keyboard position in the band and Russell took the position. At the time, Warfaze was mostly a cover band, covering bands such as [[Deep Purple]], [[Whitesnake]], [[Dokken]], [[Iron Maiden]] or [[Guns N' Roses]].<ref name="In Conversation with Warfaze">{{cite news |title=In conversation with Warfaze |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/pod-details.php?nid=15 |newspaper=The Daily Star |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616230929/http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/pod-details.php?nid=15 |archive-date=16 June 2010 |access-date=14 March 2011}}</ref>

In 1988, Reshad had left the band for some personal reason and his place was filled by Sunjoy. Kamal had made arrangements for further education in the US by 1991. However, inspired by Maqsud, former vocalist of [[Feedback (band)|Feedback]], the band performed their own Bangla songs at a concert arranged by BAMBA at the [[University of Dhaka]] on 26 April 1992. The band at this concert decided to make a mixed album, but as it turned out Warfaze had enough songs to be able to release a solo album. The band went to release their self-titled album, ''Warfaze'', on 21 June 1991. The album featured the songs "Boshe Achi Eka" and "Ekti Chele". At the time, Bangladeshi music listeners were still new to metal. Any lyrics other than those inspired by romanticism or patriotism were rare. It took several months for the album to gain popularity but later succeeded.

The album was followed up by a concert on 7 January 1992 at the Rawa Club. The next album, ''Obak Bhalobasha'', was released by Sargam in 1994. ''Obak Bhalobasha'' featured songs with heavier sounds. Warfaze's sound got developed on this album. ''Obak Bhalobasha'', the titled song from the album was big hit. This song was composed with soft melodic structures in a progressive way. The song is one of the earliest progressive rock songs in history of Bangladesh. The song was sung by Babna Karim (Warfaze's bassist), instead of their lead singer, Sunjoy. Obak Bhalobasha is one of the fewest Warfaze's hit songs which weren't sung by their lead singers. Obak Bhalobasha is also one of the longest track recorded by Warfaze, spanning for 8 minutes and 37 seconds. After completing Obak Bhalobasha Russel Ali left the band at this stage to start a music career in the United States later that year.

=== "জীবনধারা (Jibon Dhara)" and "অসামাজিক (Oshamajik)" (1996–1998) ===

The band released the album ''Jibondhara'' in 1996 December, with the line-up of vocal- Sunjoy, guitar- Kamal, bass & vocal- Babna Karim, drums- Tipu and guest keyboardist Fuad played together on the same album. Iqbal Asif Jewel joined as guest backup vocal and Ruchi backup vocal (guest).

[[Iqbal Asif Jewel]] joined as a guitarist and second vocalist from another rock band, Legend. Babna had to leave for his career and study to U.S.A. therefore he was replaced by [[Bassbaba Sumon|Saidus Sumon]] who played for ''Oshamajik'' 1 April 1998. After completing Oshamajik Sunjoy left for his personal career.<ref name="Face to Face with Sumon">{{cite web|title=Face to Face with Sumon|url=http://banglamusic.com/artists/sumon/index.html|publisher=banglamusic.com|access-date=29 March 2013}}</ref>

[[Sumon (Aurthohin)|Sumon]] left to pursue a career both as a solo artist with his band [[Aurthohin]] and Biju joined replacing Sumon. [[Iqbal Asif Jewel]] left the band to join miles. [[Fuad Ibne Rabbi]] also left the band for his personal career.

=== "আলো (Alo)" and "মহারাজ (Moharaj)" (2000–2003) ===

The band underwent many changes in line-up over the next 8 years. Their guitarist [[Balam (singer)|Balam]], replaced Iqbal Asif Jewel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Balam 2 Bangla Music Album|url=http://banglamusic.com/reviews/balam-2-bangla-music-album-646.html|publisher=banglamusic.com|access-date=28 March 2013}}</ref> Mizan replaced Sunjoy on vocals while Shams became a keyboard player from 1999 and Biju as bass. Tipu and Kamal stood in their position still. This line-up released the album ''[[Aalo (album)|আলো (Light)]]'' in 2000.

However, 2002 marked changes in the line-up once again with Mizan leaving the band for personal reasons and Kamal left the band for his personal and family issues. Kamal joined Sumon's band Aurthohin in 2006. Balam, who already sang three notable songs in the album 'Alo' took up vocal & guitar duties as Mizan left and Sazzad was recruited from ''Metal Maze'' as the lead guitarist replacing Kamal. Bass player Biju left for Canada for his study and career. All the while, Tipu solely held the band together for its existence and recruited Cézanne as bassist of the emerging progressive metal band [[Artcell]]. Later Balam departed to pursue a solo career as a commercial pop artist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Balam|url=http://banglamusic.com/interviews/interview-with-balam-403.html|publisher=banglamusic.com|access-date=29 March 2013}}</ref>

Kamal rejoined the band in 2007 and the band recruited Oni Hasan from the band Vibe, resulting a major change in their sound, with [[neoclassical metal]] influences especially in live performances.

=== "পথচলা (Pothchala)" (2009) ===
[[File:Warfaze current.jpg|thumb|Warfaze in 2008.]]
Following the release of a compilation album (sponsored by [[Nokia]]) which includes re-recorded versions of their songs along with a couple of new singles titled ''"Tomake"'' and ''"Omanush"'', and the band began touring extensively. With a new and stable line up since 2007 that had stayed together for almost more than 5 years then, the band went on to celebrate their silver jubilee at a gala concert, which featured performances from both past and present members of Warfaze at the Winter Garden, [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Hotel Sheraton]], [[Dhaka]].<ref name="Warfaze: 25 years and still going strong">{{cite news |title=Warfaze: 29 Years and Still Going Strong |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=85454 |work=The Daily Star}}</ref> Tipu announced that a live concert recording album was planned, along with a new studio album which later came out in 2012 titled ''Shotto''.

The band continued to experiment with their sound with the release of a fusion album entitled ''Somorpon'', merging elements of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] with traditional Bangladeshi [[folk music]] as a tribute to [[Hason Raja]], [[Lalon]], and [[Baul Shah Abdul Karim]] working with Sumon's band Aurthohin and solo artist [[Habib Wahid]]. Warfaze tributed the songs of [[Lalon]], Aurthohin tributed the songs of [[Hason Raja]] and Habib Wahid tributed the songs of [[Baul Shah Abdul Karim]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Banglalink launches folk album Shomorpon today |url=http://www.daily-sun.com/details_yes_08-08-2011_Banglalink-launches-folk-album-Shomorpon-today_305_1_7_1_2.html |work=The Daily Sun |access-date=27 March 2013}}</ref>

=== "সত্য (Sotto)" (2012) ===

''Shotto'', the new album was released on 21 October 2012 featuring the same line-up as in ''Poth Chola''. Tracks from the album include "Agami", "Na", "Purnota", "Shotto", "Jedin", "Rupkotha", "Jonosrot", and "Projonmo". The album also included an unreleased single from the early 2000s called "Protikkha".<ref>{{cite web|title=Warfaze’s Shotto in Banglalink Music Station|url=http://www.amadergaan.com/?p=5105|publisher=[[AmaderGaan.com]]|access-date=28 March 2013}}</ref><ref name="Warfaze’s New Album 'Shotto'">{{cite web|title=Warfaze’s New Album 'Shotto'|url=http://www.amadergaan.com/?p=4841|publisher=[[AmaderGaan.com]]|access-date=28 March 2013}}</ref>

With Oni Hasan taking a break for his studies in the United Kingdom and Kamal recovering from surgeries, the band asked Faisal (from ''Metal Maze''), Samir (from ''Powersurge''), and ''Shrapnel Method'' to perform as guest members on live shows.<ref name="Warfaze: Official Facebook Page">{{cite web|title=Warfaze Official Facebook Page|url=https://www.facebook.com/warfazefans?ref=ts&fref=ts|access-date=18 February 2013}}</ref>

With Oni playing lead guitar in the band, the sound of the album got significantly changed. Along with [[Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal|Kamal's]] [[Shred guitar|shredding]], Oni's heavy [[groove metal]] riffs was introduced. As well as his jaw-dropping [[Dive bomb (guitar technique)|dive bomb]]s, [[whammy pedal]] uses, melodic fast [[Arpeggio|arpeggiated]] [[Guitar solo|solos]] with [[sweep picking]] can be heard.

At midnight on 13 February 2013, Warfaze performed at the Projonmo Chattar to show their support for the [[Shahbag protest]] in Dhaka, Bangladesh, in demand of capital punishment for Abdul Quader Mollah and all the other accused war criminals of the 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Liberation War]] of Bangladesh. It also marked the return of Kamal with his solos.<ref>{{cite news |date=1 March 2013 |title=Spotlight: What Fuels a Revolution |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/campus/2013/03/01/spotlight.htm |newspaper=Star Campus |publisher=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |access-date=29 March 2013}}</ref>
