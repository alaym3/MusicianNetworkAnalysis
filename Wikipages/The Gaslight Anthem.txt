The Gaslight Anthem released their debut album, ''[[Sink or Swim (Gaslight Anthem album)|Sink or Swim]]'', on XOXO Records in May 2007, and their second album, ''[[The '59 Sound]]'', on [[SideOneDummy Records]] in August 2008.

==History==
===Before the Gaslight Anthem===
Brian Fallon was in a number of bands prior to the Gaslight Anthem, most recently This Charming Man. The band went through a number of line-up changes, to the point where the band consisted of Fallon, Mike Volpe, Benny Horowitz, and Alex Levine. At this stage, the band renamed themselves to the Gaslight Anthem, due to a change in direction. After this, Volpe left and Alex Rosamilia joined, and the current line-up of the Gaslight Anthem was formed.<ref name="TGAR Earlier">{{cite web|url=http://www.gaslightanthem.org/earlier.htm|title=Earlier bands|access-date=December 17, 2012}}</ref>

On July 29, 2013, rumors about the band’s hiatus peaked from  a Tumblr post  by Brian Fallon.

In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' published May 23, 2014, Fallon described the new record as "completely different than anything we had ever done before.

So if it's heavy-handed and not that cool, then let's not do it. But we all feel that this is an important record to not only us, but to the people that love it.

Fallon stated, however, that the band would not be working on new material during the reunion: "I think [[Green Day]]'s ''[[American Idiot]]'' is probably the best comeback or mid-career record that any band has done.

I don't have a ''[[Born to Run]]'' in me."<ref name="auto"/> Fallon elaborated, "People will always say, 'Why are you doing a solo record?' And I'm like, 'because I don't have anything to say with Gaslight'. Those five records, that's what you got. That’s the piece. I feel it's a lot like [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]]. There's no new music because that's all [[Paul Westerberg]] and the band has to say. When the book is over, it's over.

== Description and influences ==
''The New York Times'' music critic Jon Caramanica described the band as "part of a rich tradition of New Jersey punk, spanning [[Misfits (band)|the Misfits]] to the [[Bouncing Souls]]."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/arts/music/20gaslight.html|title=A New Dawn Breaks for the Gaslight Anthem | work=The New York Times | first=Jon | last=Caramanica | date=June 18, 2010}}</ref> The Gaslight Anthem's music also embraces many elements of the [[Jersey Shore sound]]. Brian Fallon's fondness for [[Bruce Springsteen|Springsteen]], a significant influence on their music, is a fact celebrated by fans and critics alike. However, the band claims they never set out to sound like the New Jersey icon.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/article/834387--rising-for-the-gaslight-anthem|title=For The Gaslight | location=Toronto | work=The Star | first=Chandler | last=Levack | date=July 12, 2010}}</ref> Representative of such views, one critic wrote, "The Gaslight Anthem are like something out of speculative fiction: this is what pop music would be if Springsteen hadn't listened to his producer, let [[the Ramones]] record ''[[Hungry Heart]]'', and launched the [[CBGB|C.B.G.B.]]'ers into megastardom."<ref>"Review of 'Senor and the Queen.'"

We didn't start listening to him until we joined the band. I always liked his songs when I heard them, but I wasn't a big fan until I met Brian [Fallon]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressplus1.com/music/setting-the-stage-on-fire-the-gaslight-anthem.html|title=Setting the Stage on Fire – The Gaslight Anthem|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715114657/http://www.pressplus1.com/music/setting-the-stage-on-fire-the-gaslight-anthem.html|archive-date=July 15, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Following the release of their third album, ''American Slang'', Fallon himself said, "There's so much else that we look at for our sound and influences that you don't want to be notched in with one guy... There's a lot of things [Springsteen] does that I admire. We come from a lot of the same places but a lot of different places, too. But at the same time, that's a good thing to be compared to. I think it's one of those things we're gonna have to wear until it wears out."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/957420/the-gaslight-anthem-talks-springsteen-comparisons-american-slang-success|title=The Gaslight Anthem Talks Springsteen Comparisons, 'American Slang' Success|date=July 12, 2010|website=Billboard.com|access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref> Of the Springsteen comparisons, Rosamilia added, "I think there's enough out there on the Internet about that already."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metroactive.com/music-clubs/gaslight-anthem.html|title=The Gaslight Anthem &#124; Music & Clubs &#124; Metro Newspapers|website=Metroactive.com|access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref>

The song "I'da Called You Woody, Joe" is a tribute to [[Joe Strummer]], who has been spoken about and referenced by lead singer Brian Fallon often. Similarly, [[Tom Petty]] is referenced in several songs, either by name or through references to particular songs of his. The band has covered Petty's "[[American Girl (Tom Petty song)|American Girl]]" and "Refugee" live.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://intunemusiconline.com/2009/04/27/the-gaslight-anthem-heartless-bastards-nyc-327/ |title = inTuneMusic Online: The Gaslight Anthem / Pela / Good Old War @ Asbury Park 5/9 |author = Ambrose, Anthony |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://archive.today/20120710152705/http://intunemusiconline.com/2009/04/27/the-gaslight-anthem-heartless-bastards-nyc-327/ |archive-date = July 10, 2012 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> As a bonus track for the deluxe version of ''Handwritten'', the Gaslight Anthem covered the [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]] song "[[You Got Lucky]]".
