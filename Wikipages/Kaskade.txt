==Musical career==
===1995–2000: Early beginnings===
In 1995, Raddon began DJing his first monthly Monday night party at a basement venue called Club Manhattan. He used this additional income to purchase studio essentials.<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/10/fashion/a-200000-a-night-dj-known-as-kaskade-is-really-ryan-raddon-a-mormon.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|title=How Ryan Raddon Became the -a-Night D.J.

To Raddon's benefit, San Francisco was an emerging site of a new [[deep house]] movement.<ref name="nytimes.com"/> While at OM records he continued DJing and producing music. Soon after, Raddon created his alter ego, Kaskade, which his wife worried would remind people of the dish detergent.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/10/fashion/a-200000-a-night-dj-known-as-kaskade-is-really-ryan-raddon-a-mormon.html?_r=0|title=A 200,000 a Night DJ Known as Kaskade is Really Ryan Raddon a Mormon|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=2015-11-26}}</ref> He took his stage name from a nature book when he saw a picture of a waterfall and a co-worker agreed "cascade" was a good choice, but he then changed the spelling. He did not take his name from the [[Cascade Range]] in the Pacific Northwest as fans sometimes cite.<ref name="name-origin">{{cite web|title=On the roof with producer/DJ Kaskade |url=http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/blogs/off-the-record/2009/apr/03/roof-producerdj-kaskade/ |access-date=April 3, 2009}}</ref>

After mixing the third volume in the Sounds of Om series, Ryan was offered a three-album deal for Kaskade. He kicked off the deal with a full-length house debut, It's You It's Me. Garnering critical acclaim, spawning several singles, and receiving a prestigious Dance Star nomination for Best New Artist, the release put Kaskade squarely on the dance music world's radar.<ref>Preve, Francis.
