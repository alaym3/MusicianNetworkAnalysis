'''Françoise Madeleine Hardy''' ({{IPA-fr|fʁɑ̃swaz madlɛn aʁdi}}; born 17 January 1944) is a French singer and songwriter. Mainly known for singing melancholic [[sentimental ballad]]s, Hardy has been an important figure in [[French pop]] music since her debut, spanning a career of more than fifty years with over thirty studio albums released. She rose to prominence in the early 1960s as a leading figure of the [[yé-yé]] wave, a genre of [[pop music]] and associated [[youth culture]] phenomenon that adapted to French the pop and [[Rock music|rock]] styles that came from the United States and the United Kingdom. The singer differentiated herself from her peers by writing her own material, a rare feat in an industry dominated by older, male composers and producers. France's most exportable female singer of the era, Hardy rose to international fame and released music sung in English, Italian and German, in addition to her native French. She also landed roles as a [[supporting actress]] in the films ''[[Nutty, Naughty Chateau|Château en Suède]]'', ''[[A Bullet Through the Heart|Une balle au cœur]]'' and the American big-budget production ''[[Grand Prix (1966 film)|Grand Prix]]'', although she never pursued a serious acting career. In the mid-1960s, she also established herself as a [[Pop icon|pop]] and fashion icon with the aid of photographer [[Jean-Marie Périer]], becoming a muse for top designers such as [[André Courrèges]], [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]] and [[Paco Rabanne]]. In the English-speaking world, her trendy public image and personal style led her to become an icon for the [[Swinging London]] scene, and attracted the admiration of several famous artists. Long after the height of her career in the 1960s, Hardy remains one of the best-selling singers in French history, and continues to be regarded as an iconic and influential figure in both music and fashion. Her work has appeared on several critics' lists.

Born and raised in the [[9th arrondissement of Paris|9th arrondissement]] of [[Paris]], Hardy had a troubled childhood marked by the strict upbringing of her [[single mother]] and a largely absent father. As a teenager, she discovered English-language [[rock and roll]] performers including [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Brill Building pop]] acts such as [[Paul Anka]] through the radio, and decided to pursue a singing career. Hardy made her musical debut in 1962 on French label [[Disques Vogue]] and found immediate success through the [[hit song]] "[[Tous les garçons et les filles]]", which remains one of her most popular compositions. Disliking the production of her early releases, she began to record in London in 1964, which allowed her to broaden her sound with albums such as ''[[Mon amie la rose (album)|Mon amie la rose]]'', ''[[L'amitié]]'', ''[[La maison où j'ai grandi (album)|La maison où j'ai grandi]]'' and ''[[Ma jeunesse fout le camp...]].'' In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Hardy sought to assert herself as an artist, although this implied less commercial repercussion. The albums ''[[Comment te dire adieu (album)|Comment te dire adieu]]'', ''[[La question (album)|La question]]'' and ''[[Message personnel (album)|Message personnel]]''—released during this period—are among her most influential and critically acclaimed works. In them, Hardy began to work with more renowned songwriters such as [[Serge Gainsbourg]], [[Patrick Modiano]], [[Michel Berger]] and [[Catherine Lara]]. Between 1977 and 1988, she worked with producer [[Gabriel Yared]] in a string of successful albums, including ''Star'', ''Musique saoûle'', ''Gin Tonic'' and ''À suivre''. Her 1988 record ''Décalages'' was widely publicized as Hardy's final album, although she returned eight years later with ''Le danger'', which completely reinvented her sound to a harsher [[alternative rock]]. Her following albums of the 2000s—''[[Clair-obscur (album)|Clair-obscur]]'', ''Tant de belles choses'' and ''(Parenthèses...)''—saw a return to her mellow style.

As a public figure, Hardy is known for her [[shyness]], disenchantment with [[celebrity]] life and [[Self-deprecation|self-deprecatory]] attitude—attributed to  her lifelong struggles with [[anxiety]] and [[Emotional security|insecurity]]. In addition to music, Hardy has developed a renowned career as an [[astrologer]], having written extensively on the subject since the 1970s as a proponent of the "conditionalist" [[school of thought]]—outlined by Jean-Pierre Nicola—which rejects the [[divinatory]] use of the discipline. Since the 2000s, she has also worked as a writer of both [[fiction]] and [[non-fiction]] books, including a bestselling [[autobiography]] and two [[essays]]. Through these works, Hardy has been noted for her frankness in discussing her family life and health problems related to [[MALT lymphoma]] and [[old age]], as well as her sometimes controversial political ideas. In 2006, she was awarded the ''[[Grande médaille de la chanson française]]'' honorary award given by the [[Académie française]], in recognition of her career in music. In the 2010s, Hardy released her last three albums: ''La pluie sans parapluie'', ''[[L'Amour fou (album)|L'amour fou]]''—released alongside her eponymous first [[novel]] in celebration of the 50th anniversary of her music career—and ''[[Personne d'autre]]''—which brought her out of a previously declared retirement. She has been married to fellow French singer-songwriter [[Jacques Dutronc]] since 1981 and their only son, [[Thomas Dutronc|Thomas]], is also a musician. In 2021, Hardy announced that her health had worsenered and that she would not be able to sing again due to the effects of [[cancer therapy]].

==Early life==
[[File:Rue dAumale Paris.jpg|thumb|Hardy was raised in a modest apartment on the Rue d'Aumale street, in [[Paris]]' [[9th arrondissement of Paris|9th arrondissement]].]]
Françoise Madeleine Hardy was born on 17 January 1944 at the Marie-Louise Clinic in the [[9th arrondissement of Paris|9th arrondissement]] of [[Paris]], in [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Nazi-occupied France]] during [[World War II]].<ref name="HardyOne">Hardy, 2018 [2008], "One"</ref> At the time of her birth, there was an [[Bombing of France during World War II|air raid]] alert in place, with the windows of the clinic "exploding".<ref name="radio"/> She has related being born during this violent context with the "abnormally anxious temperament" that she developed as an adult.<ref name="radio"/> Her mother Madeleine Hardy, who came from an ordinary background, raised Françoise and her younger sister Michèle—born eighteen months after her—as a [[single parent]].<ref name="QuinoneroEnfance">Quinonero, 2017, "«C'est ton enfance / Qui se promène à cloche-pied / Dans ta mémoire..."</ref> Her father Étienne Dillard—a married man that came from a much wealthier family—did little to help them financially and was largely an absent figure in their upbringing,<ref name="QuinoneroEnfance"/><ref name="linternaute"/> only visiting the children a couple of times a year.<ref name="rfi"/> Madeleine Hardy raised her daughters strictly, in a modest apartment on the 9th arrondissement's Rue d'Aumale street.<ref name="QuinoneroEnfance"/> Hardy had an unhappy and troubled childhood,<ref name="rfi"/> and mainly engaged in solitary activities like reading, playing with dolls or listening to the radio.<ref name="QuinoneroMonLit">Quinonero, 2017, "«Dans mon lit / Je dors, je rêve ou je lis»"</ref> At the insistence of their father, the girls went to a [[Catholic school]] called Institution La Bruyère, under the tutelage of [[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] nuns.<ref name="HardyOne"/> The gap of social origin between Hardy and her classmates was a source of permanent humiliation for her.<ref name="QuinoneroEnfance"/> She recalled in her autobiography: "This is most likely where the feeling of shame that has tormented me non-stop since I was a child took root. Everything fell into place: the social status of my parents who I naively believed were divorced, (...) the good sisters' constant complaints that my father was generally a year behind in his payments, and the various differences with the other girls."<ref name="HardyOne"/> Her lifelong insecurities were also fuelled by her regular visits to her maternal grandmother in [[Aulnay-sous-Bois]],<ref name="HardyOne"/><ref name="QuinoneroEnfance"/> who "told [her] repeatedly that [she] was unattractive and a very bad person".<ref name="mortality"/>  Between 1952 and 1960, Hardy and her sister were sent every summer to Austria to learn German, encouraged by her mother's new lover, an [[Austrian nobility|Austrian baron]].<ref name="QuinoneroAustria">Quinonero, 2017, "Les étés autrichiens"</ref> As her father played piano, Hardy was encouraged to receive piano lessons as a very young child, from which she quickly dropped out after experiencing stage fright when she was supposed to display her talents onstage at the [[Salle Gaveau]].<ref name="HardyTwo"/> 

A disciplined student, Hardy skipped two years of secondary education and passed her ''[[baccalauréat]]'' in 1960 at age sixteen.<ref name="Two">Hardy, 2018 [2008], "Two"</ref> To mark the occasion, her father asked her what gift she would like and she chose a guitar, with which she began to sing her own melodies.<ref name="Two"/> Following her mother's orders, she enrolled in the [[Paris Institute of Political Studies]] while still a teenager.<ref name="Two"/> Considering it too challenging, she quickly left the institution and joined the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] to study German.<ref name="QuinoneroGuitare"/> Hardy used the time left from her courses to devote herself to composing songs on her guitar.<ref name="Two"/> She began to test her repertoire on the small stage of venue Moka Club, also known as Club des mordus, where she performed every Thursday "in front of an audience of retirees".<ref name="QuinoneroGuitare"/> Around this time, she auditioned for record label [[Pathé-Marconi]] after reading an ad in ''[[France-Soir]]''.<ref name="QuinoneroGuitare"/> Although she was rejected, Hardy was impressed that she had held the directors' attention for longer than she expected.<ref name="QuinoneroGuitare"/> She also felt encouraged after hearing her recorded voice, which she found "less off-key and tremulous than [she] feared".<ref name="HardyTwo"/> The aspiring singer then went to [[Philips Records]], where she was recommended to take singing lessons.<ref name="QuinoneroGuitare"/> Following this advice, Hardy joined ''Le Petit Conservatoire de la chanson'' in 1961, a school for radio performers—the first of its kind in France—led by singer [[Mireille Hartuch]]. Originally launched as a radio program in 1955, the ''Petit Conservatoire'' was turned into a popular TV show beginning in June 1960.<ref name="QuinoneroGuitare">Quinonero, 2017, "«Un air de guitare..."</ref><ref name="INAfille">{{cite web|url=https://www.ina.fr/contenus-editoriaux/articles-editoriaux/1962-francoise-hardy-jeune-espoir-du-petit-conservatoire|language=French|access-date=21 May 2021|date=29 March 2021|first=Florence|last=Dartois|title=1962, Françoise Hardy, jeune espoir du "Petit conservatoire"|publisher=[[Institut national de l'audiovisuel|INA]]}}</ref> When a student gave a satisfactory performance, they were given the chance to release it on the radio, or even perform it again for television.<ref name="HardyTwo"/> Hartuch—who was known to be very selective—accepted Hardy right away, recalling in 1966: "The first time Françoise entered the classroom to audition, I didn't know if she sang, if she played guitar, what she was doing, I just looked and felt like there was a spark, something that lit up."<ref name="QuinoneroGuitare"/> They developed a "mother-daughter relationship" and a long friendship based on mutual esteem.<ref name="QuinoneroGuitare"/>

On 14 May 1961, Hardy auditioned for the French label [[Disques Vogue]], where was received by directors Serge Goron and Léo Vidaly, who recommended that she take music theory and harmony lessons with a pianist.<ref name="QuinoneroVogue"/> Her good looks impressed Vogue sound engineer André Bernot—feeling that she "would make a nice record cover"—who offered to teach her some rudiments of music theory in order to improve her sense of rhythm.<ref name="QuinoneroVogue"/> Bernot later recorded a four-track [[Demo (music)|demo]] with her, which he submitted to Jacques Wolfsohn, the most influential director at Vogue.<ref name="QuinoneroVogue"/> At that time, Wolfsohn was looking for a female singer to record "Oh oh chéri", a French-language version of [[Bobby Lee Trammell]]'s song "Uh Oh".<ref name="Hardy Two">Hardy, 2018 [2008], "Two"</ref><ref name="QuinoneroVogue"/> After an audition in person, Wolfsohn immediately offered her a one-year contract,<ref name="Hardy Two"/> which she signed on 14 November 1961.<ref name="QuinoneroVogue">Quinonero, 2017, "En Vogue"</ref> Upon learning of Hardy's new record deal, Mireille Hartuch presented her student at the ''Petit Conservatoire'' TV show on 6 February 1962, in what has been described as "one of the most popular French TV extracts of all time".<ref name="rfi"/><ref name="petitfille">{{cite web|url=https://www.ina.fr/contenus-editoriaux/articles-editoriaux/1962-francoise-hardy-jeune-espoir-du-petit-conservatoire/|title=1962, Françoise Hardy, jeune espoir du "Petit conservatoire"|access-date=28 May 2021|date=29 March 2021|language=French|publisher=[[Institut national de l'audiovisuel|INA]]|first=Florence|last=Dartois}}</ref> In a much remembered exchange, the hostess asked the young singer what the English-language "yeah! yeah!" in her lyrics meant, after she performed "La fille avec toi" on her guitar.<ref name="petitfille"/><ref name="HardyTwo"/> The [[transliteration]] "[[yé-yé]]" was later popularized by sociologist [[Edgar Morin]] through an article published in ''[[Le Monde]]'' on 7 July 1963, in which he analyzed the burgeoning youth-led pop music scene.<ref name="Briggs1425"> Briggs, 2015, pp. 14–25</ref><ref name="QuinoneroTournee"/> The yé-yé phenomenon was spearheaded by the massively popular radio program ''[[Salut les copains (radio program)|Salut les copains]]''—created by [[Daniel Filipacchi]]—and a successful [[Salut les copains (magazine)|magazine of the same name]].<ref name="Briggs1425"/><ref name="QuinoneroGarcon"/>

Recorded in the spring, Vogue released her first [[extended play]] in May 1962, which included "Oh oh chéri" along with her own compositions "Il est parti un jour", "J'suis d'accord" and the sentimental ballad "[[Tous les garçons et les filles]]", which despite her wishes was relegated as a [[B-side]] because the label deemed it too melancholic for young audiences.<ref name="QuinoneroProjets">Quinonero, 2017, "«Des projets d'avenir»"</ref> On 5 June 1962, the singer proudly shared the record sleeve at the ''Petit Conservatoire''.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Institut national de l'audiovisuel|INA]]|language=French|access-date=26 May 2021|url=https://m.ina.fr/video/I06051237/francoise-hardy-au-petit-conservatoire-video.html|title=Françoise Hardy au Petit Conservatoire}}</ref> In early October, Hardy filmed a black-and-white [[music video]] for "Tous les garçons et les filles" directed by Pierre Badel, which aired on TV show ''Toute la chanson''.<ref name="QuinoneroVogue"/> The song was chosen at the initiative of Hardy and the show's producer André Salvet, despite Wolfsohn's reluctance to promote it.<ref name="QuinoneroVogue"/> Hardy was introduced to the large majority of French people on the evening of 28 October 1962, when the clip was rebroadcast during an interlude of the televised results of the [[1962 French presidential election referendum|presidential election referendum]].<ref name="linternaute">{{cite web|url=https://www.linternaute.com/musique/biographie/1777696-francoise-hardy-malade-ce-que-l-on-sait-sur-sa-sante/|language=French|access-date=10 May 2021|title=Françoise Hardy malade: ce que l'on sait sur sa santé|first=Sarah|last=Dieu|date=31 March 2021|publisher=[[L'Internaute]]}}</ref><ref name="abc">{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.es/cultura/musica/abci-francoise-hardy-nuevo-disco-201210300000_noticia.html|language=Spanish|access-date=11 May 2021|title=Françoise Hardy: nuevo disco y primera novela|last=de la Fuente|first=Manuel|date=21 October 2012|work=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]}}</ref><ref name="QuinoneroElectre"/> The exposure propelled the song to widespread popularity among young people—particularly teenage girls—aided by the wide airplay it received by radio stations, starting with youth-favorite [[Europe n° 1]].<ref name="QuinoneroProjets"/> "Tous les garçons et les filles" was further popularized by a [[Scopitone]] music video directed by [[Claude Lelouch]], which shows the singer in an amusement ride alongside two girls whose skirts are lifted up by the wind.<ref name="QuinoneroElectre">Quinonero, 2017, "«Électre en ciré noir»"</ref>

Her 1965 English-language single "[[All Over the World (Françoise Hardy song)|All Over the World]]" was a substantial hit in the United Kingdom, reaching the Top 20 and staying in the charts for fifteen weeks.<ref name="allovertheworld">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/all-over-the-world-mt0028665336|author-link=Richie Unterberger|first=Richie|last=Unterberger|access-date=14 May 2021|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|title=All Over the World – Françoise Hardy}}</ref> It was also successful in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand,<ref name="QuinoneroLondres"/> probably being her most popular recording among English-speaking audiences.<ref name="allovertheworld"/> She promoted the song with performances on the British TV shows ''Ready Steady Go!'', [[Five O'Clock Club|''Ollie and Fred's Five O'Clock Club'']], ''[[Thank Your Lucky Stars (TV series)|Thank Your Lucky Stars]]'' and ''[[Top of the Pops]]''.<ref name="QuinoneroMonde">Quinonero, 2017, "«Dans le monde entier»"</ref>

In 1965, Hardy flew to New York City to sign a record deal with [[Kapp Records|Kapp]], allowing them to distribute her records in the United States.<ref name="QuinoneroMonde"/> The label released her debut studio album under the title ''The "Yeh-Yeh" Girl From Paris!'', as well as the single "However Much"—an English-language version of the previously released track "Et même...".<ref name="QuinoneroMonde"/> While in the United States, Hardy made her first appearance in American television in [[NBC]]'s program ''[[Hullabaloo (TV series)|Hullabaloo]]'', where she performed "However Much", a bilingual version of [[Charles Trenet]]'s "[[Que reste-t-il de nos amours ?]]" and a rendition of "[[The Girl from Ipanema]]".<ref name="QuinoneroMonde"/>

The singer became famous overnight in Germany after her 28 April 1965 appearance on TV show ''Portrait in Musik'', in a series of staged musical performances directed by Truck Branss.<ref name="HardyThree"/><ref name="QuinoneroMonde"/> Shortly after, the album ''[[In Deutschland]]'' was released, which, in addition to containing translated versions of her previous songs, included five original compositions.<ref name="QuinoneroMonde"/> Her most popular track in Germany was "Frag' den Abendwind", which remained in the national singles' chart for twenty-four weeks.<ref name="QuinoneroMonde"/>

Pressured by her French and Italian record companies,<ref name="HardyThree"/> Hardy took part in the [[Sanremo Music Festival 1966]], where she reached the finals with the [[Edoardo Vianello]]-penned song "Parlami di te".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o1HE8o8RTXgC&pg=PA233|page=233|access-date=14 May 2021|title=L'enciclopedia di Sanremo: 55 anni di storia del festival dalla A alla Z|year=2005|first=Marcello|last=Giannotti|isbn=978-8884403797|language=Italian|publisher=Gremese Editore}}</ref>

On 12 April 1966, Hardy was among the forty-six performers that took part in the famous group photograph shot by [[Jean-Marie Périer]] for ''Salut Les Copains'', which became a symbol of the yé-yé era and came to be known in France as the "photo of the century" (French: "''photo du siècle''").<ref name="linternaute"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.lematin.ch/story/la-photo-du-siecle-a-50-ans-238515438548|language=French|access-date=12 May 2021|title=La "photo du siècle" a 50 ans|last=Flückiger|first=Laurent|date=12 April 2016|work=[[Le Matin (Switzerland)|Le Matin]]}}</ref>

Beginning in late 1967, Hardy began to release her records under her own production company Asparagus, although Vogue continued to distribute them.<ref name="QuinoneroSeptieme">Quinonero, 2017, "Septième album"</ref> She later regretted this decision, recalling in 1999: "Wolfsohn had sensed that the singers were going to want to be more and more independent. So it was he himself who suggested that I create a production house. At first I was very seduced, then I realized that it was a trap: the CEO of Vogue, Léon Cabat, was also in this production company and, between them, owned the majority of the shares. This has given rise to a lot of harassment, lawsuits."<ref name="QuinoneroSeptieme"/> Her seventh French studio album ''[[Ma jeunesse fout le camp...]]''—the first one produced under Asparagus—was released in November 1967.<ref name="QuinoneroSeptieme"/>

Hardy gave her last three live performances in [[Kinshasa]], Congo during June 1967.<ref name="QuinoneroAnglais">Quinonero, 2017, "«En anglais»"</ref>

On the advice of English producer Noel Rodgers, Hardy recorded her [[En anglais|second English-language album]] in the spring of 1968, known variously as ''En anglais'', ''The Second English Album'', ''Will You Love Me Tomorrow'' and ''Loving'', depending on the country.<ref name="QuinoneroAnglais"/>

===1969–1976: Transition to artistic maturity===
[[File:Francoise-hardy-amsterdam-1969-ii-large (cropped 2).png|thumb|Hardy in Amsterdam, December 1969.]]
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Hardy sought to assert herself as an artist, although this implied less commercial repercussion than that which she had achieved with Disques Vogue.<ref name="efeeme">{{cite web|url=https://www.efeeme.com/la-question-1971-de-francoise-hardy/|language=Spanish|access-date=8 May 2021|title=La question (1971), de Françoise Hardy|date=30 May 2020|first=Javier de Diego|last=Romero|publisher=Efe Eme}}</ref> In 1970, the singer definitively broke up with the label and signed a three-year contract with [[Sonopresse]], a subsidiary of [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]].<ref name="QuinoneroDomicile">Quinonero, 2017, "Double changement de domicile"</ref> She also created a new production company—called Hypopotam—and founded her own music publishing company—Kundalini.<ref name="QuinoneroDomicile"/> Hardy received high advances from Sonopresse, which allowed her to finance her own projects.<ref name="HardySeven"/> She has described this period as "the happiest time", as she was now able to work independently on her music endeavours.<ref name="QuinoneroDomicile"/> This transitional period in her career was kicked off by the 1970 publication of several [[compilation albums]]—including the French release ''Françoise''—as well as the studio albums ''[[One-Nine-Seven-Zero]]''—recorded in English—and ''[[Träume]]'', her last German-language release.<ref name="QuinoneroDomicile"/>

<blockquote>
I have never been as proud of one of my records as I was of [''La question'']. (...) This album seems to me to be more homogenous, "classier," and sophisticated than my previous efforts, and while it did not enjoy great success with the public at large, at least I can claim that it did touch another audience. (...) Often an ambitious record can be more or less ignored when it is released but ends up having a long life. The sole concern, and it is a valid one, is that some of the artists who played on it were in no position to wait twenty years to feed themselves. I became increasingly concerned about this situation as time passed, even though creating songs remains a very particular life choice, one that involves accepting natural selection and precarious employment.<ref name="HardySeven"/>
</blockquote>
Following the poor commercial performance of ''La question'', Hardy decided to move towards a different sound and enlisted British arranger [[Tony Cox (record producer)|Tony Cox]] to produce her following album.<ref name="HardySeven"/> Known as ''Et si je m'en vais avant toi'', ''L'éclairage'' or "the orange album"—in reference to its cover—the record was released in November 1972 and promoted through the single "La berlue", released in June.<ref name="QuinoneroRouge"/> Immediately after finishing ''Et si je m'en vais avant toi'', Hardy and Cox recorded the English-language release ''[[If You Listen]]'', which included cover versions of several little-known American and British songs.<ref name="HardySeven"/> Hardy's Sonopresse period, which had started off well thanks to the success of ''Comment te dire adieu?'' and ''Soleil'', ended on a sour note with the commercial failure of ''La question'', ''Et si je m'en vais avant toi'' and ''If You Listen''—which she nevertheless considered her "best [albums] by far".<ref name="HardySeven"/> After her contract expired, the record label decided not to renew it.<ref name="QuinoneroVI"/> The singer was relatively unbothered by the poor sales, feeling that she had been artistically vindicated with these records.<ref name="rfi"/><ref name="HardySeven"/> 

Around 1972, Hardy contacted songwriter and producer [[Michel Berger]] with the intention of working with him, after being impressed by his work with [[Véronique Sanson]].<ref name="HardyEight"/><ref name="QuinoneroVI">Quinonero, 2017, "«TOUS CES MOTS QUI FONT PEUR QUAND ILS NE FONT PAS RIRE...

For her following project, Hardy wrote ten songs that revolved around a common, underlying story.<ref name="HardyNine"/><ref name="QuinoneroFaim"/> To put the words into music, she mainly relied on her friend [[Catherine Lara]], also working with Jean-Pierre Castelain and Gérard Kawczynski (with whom she had worked in ''Message personnel''), André Georget and Michel Sivy.<ref name="QuinoneroFaim"/> Produced by [[Hughes de Courson]], the [[concept album]] ''Entr'acte'' was released in November 1974 and promoted through the songs "Ce soir", "Je te cherche" and "Il y a eu des nuits".<ref name="QuinoneroFaim">Quinonero, 2017, "«Il y a eu des nuits / Où je mourais de toi / Comme on meurt de faim...»"</ref> It was a commercial failure.<ref name="HardyTen"/> The singer then decided to stay away from music and devote more time to raising her child, releasing only two singles between 1975 and 1976.<ref name="rfi"/><ref name="QuinoneroFaim"/> The first one was the [[Jean-Michel Jarre]]-penned "Que vas-tu faire?"—backed by "Le compte a rebours"—<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Que vas-tu faire?|others=Françoise Hardy |year=1975|type=7-inch single|location=France|publisher=[[Warner Records|Warner Bros.

Around 1976, Berger recontacted Hardy with the intention of signing her to his new record label Apache and she sent him the songs "Ton enfance", "Star" and "L'impasse".<ref name="HardyTen">Hardy, 2018 [2008], "Ten"</ref> However, Berger was keen on releasing an album with compositions structured around a unifying concept, so she gave up the idea of joining the label.<ref name="HardyTen"/> She finally signed a three-year contract with [[Pathé-Marconi]].<ref name="QuinoneroYared">Quinonero, 2017, "Gabriel Yared, le gentil tyran"</ref>

[[File:Françoise Hardy05.JPG|thumb|upright|Hardy in Deauville, Normandy, July 1992.]]
For 1977's ''Star'', her first album released under Pathé-Marconi, Hardy enlisted [[Gabriel Yared]] as a producer and arranger.<ref name="QuinoneroYared"/> The "patchwork album" includes six tracks written by Hardy, along with songs written by [[Serge Gainsbourg]], [[William Sheller]], Catherine Lara, [[Luc Plamondon]], Roland Vincent and [[Michel Jonasz]].<ref name="QuinoneroYared"/> At first, their relationship was tense,<ref name="QuinoneroYared"/> and ''Star'' was recorded under a "strained atmosphere", which earned her the nickname "ice queen".<ref name="rfi"/><ref name="independent05"/> According to Frédéric Quinonero, "the singer deemed it necessary to immediately dispel any misunderstanding, physical or sentimental, before being integrating into a faithful friendship."<ref name="QuinoneroYared"/> ''Star'' was a commercial success that put the singer back into the media spotlight, introducing her work to a new generation of young people.<ref name="rfi"/> Despite their stiff relationship in the recording studio, Hardy and Yared would continue to work together for nearly six years and record five albums.<ref name="rfi"/><ref name="QuinoneroYared"/> In 1991, the singer recalled her work with the producer:
<blockquote>
Gabriel [Yared] is demanding, rigorous and, consequently, disturbing, destabilizing, in work as in friendship. He had great influence over me. The five albums we made together were not easy, there were even tensions on the verge of breaking up, but I consider that it was one of the great chances of my life to find myself again under the guidance of a musician of this dimension.<ref name="QuinoneroYared"/>

Her 1978 follow-up ''Musique saoûle'' included compositions by Yared, Alain Goldstein and Michel Jonasz.<ref>{{cite AV media|type=LP record|location=France|title=Musique saoûle|publisher=[[Pathé-Marconi]]|id=2C 070-14697|year=1978|others=Françoise Hardy}}</ref> The album changed Hardy's musical direction to a more danceable sound with commercial success, aided by the popularity of lead single "J'écoute de la musique saoule", especially its extended remix version.<ref name="QuinoneroTonic"/> It was promoted through intensive televised appearances, which showed the singer "awkwardly" performing the track among a dancing crowd.<ref name="QuinoneroTonic"/> Fueled by the popularity of "J'écoute de la musique saoule" with young people, Yared and collaborator Bernard Ilous worked on her following 1980 album ''Gin Tonic'' with an even more commercial approach.<ref name="QuinoneroTonic"/> Its album cover attempted to present a "furiously modern" image of the singer and was photographed by a collaborator from ''Façade'', a French magazine modelled after [[Andy Warhol]]'s journal ''Influence''.<ref name="QuinoneroTonic"/> ''Gin Tonic'' was promoted through singles "Jazzy rétro Satanas" and "Juke-box", with only the former achieving modest commercial success.<ref name="QuinoneroTonic"/> Despite reduced sales and mixed reviews, the singer's respectability remained intact and she was invited as a distinguished guest in [[Maritie and Gilbert Carpentier]]'s TV show ''Numéro Un'' in 1980.<ref name="QuinoneroTonic"/> Hardy's following album ''À suivre'' was released in April 1981 on label Flarenasch, in breach of contract with Pathé-Marconi.<ref name="QuinoneroMariage"/> It featured a new array of collaborators—presumably because of her dissatisfaction with her previous songs—with Yared enlisting composers [[Louis Chedid]], Pierre Groscolas, Jean-Claude Vannier, [[Michel Bernholc]], Daniel Perreau, Jean-Pierre Bourtayre and [[Étienne Roda-Gil]].<ref name="QuinoneroMariage"/> ''À suivre'' was promoted through singles "Tamalou" and "Villégiature", with only the former achieving commercial success.<ref name="QuinoneroMariage"/>

''Décalages'' was released on 2 May 1988.<ref name="QuinoneroDecalages"/> Promoted as Hardy's final album, it was a commercial success and was certified [[Gold disc|gold]] for selling a hundred thousand copies.<ref name="QuinoneroDecalages">Hardy, 2017, "Décalages et dérapages"</ref>

In 1990, the singer wrote the song "[[Fais-moi une place]]" for [[Julien Clerc]], which was included in his album of the same name.<ref name="linternaute"/>

==Astrological career==
In addition to music, Hardy has developed a career as an [[astrologer]], having written extensively on the subject. She aligns herself with the so-called "conditionalist" [[school of thought]]—outlined by Jean-Pierre Nicola in his 1964 book ''La condition solaire''—which puts forward a non-[[divinatory]] character of the discipline and considers that it should be used taking into account other factors such as hereditary, educational and socio-cultural determinants.<ref name="HardyAtrologia">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RtAwDwAAQBAJ|access-date=6 May 2021|last=Hardy|first=Françoise|author-link=Françoise Hardy|trans-title=La astrología universal|title=L'astrologie universelle|orig-year=1987|type=eBook|year=2007|isbn=978-8431535810|language=Spanish|location=Barcelona|publisher=De Vecchi Ediciones|chapter=Introducción}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0lcMEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA103|pages=103–104|language=French|access-date=10 May 2021|title=L'astrologie: le grand voyage en soi et dans l'avenir|first=Yves|last=Lenoble|year=2020|publisher=BoD|isbn=978-2382580141}}</ref> Hardy has written about her distrust of most astrologers and of "predictive astrology", explaining:
<blockquote>
... I believe this human science is restricted to offering information on one of the many factors that conditions our lives—the one connected with the rhythms of our solar system. It simply allows us to get our bearings and identify as best we can the various phases of our development, which are dependent on many more factors than just planetary cycles and configurations, and does not necessarily translate into terms of particular events and outcomes.<ref name="HardySix"/>
</blockquote>
Hardy first became interested in the practice after consulting astrologer André Barbault in the mid-1960s.<ref name="HardySix">Hardy, 2018 [2008], "Six"</ref> She took public courses, learned to draw up a [[birth chart]] and read many specialized books before meeting Catherine Aubier, who recommended her professor to Hardy.<ref name="HardySix"/> Hardy was then taught traditional astrology for two years by Madame Godefroy in Paris.<ref name="HardySix"/> She became more dedicated to astrology after meeting Nicola in late 1974, who contacted her to be part of a new magazine he was developing.<ref name="HardySix"/> The singer has described Nicola as "the best astrologer in the world"<ref name="clash">{{cite web|url=https://www.clashmusic.com/features/another-person-fran%C3%A7oise-hardy-interviewed|access-date=6 May 2021|date=23 April 2018|first=Hayley|last=Scott|work=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]|title=Another Person: Françoise Hardy Interviewed}}</ref> and wrote: "[he] initiated me into an intelligent understanding of astrology and trained me to use it, by his side, to the best of my ability."<ref name="HardySix"/> Besides astrology, Hardy was initiated into the [[Tarot card reading|reading]] of the [[Tarot of Marseilles]] by [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]].<ref name="HardyTwelve">Hardy, 2018 [2008], "Twelve"</ref> As a complement to her astrological knowledge, she also took courses with [[graphologist]] Germaine Tripier, the dean of the French Society of Graphology.<ref name="HardyTwelve"/>

Between recordings of her album ''Gin Tonic'' in 1979, Hardy was asked by Nicola to collaborate on a collection on the zodiac signs launched by Tchou Editions, being tasked with writing the book dedicated to [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]].<ref name="HardyEleven">Hardy, 2018 [2008], "Eleven"</ref> Since she had no time to write the book by herself, she shared her work with fellow astrologer Béatrice Guénin.<ref name="HardyEleven"/> She also collaborated with magazine ''Quinze Ans''.<ref name="QuinoneroTonic"/> In late 1980, Hardy was contacted by Pierre Lescure of the [[RMC (France)|RMC]] radio station to entrust her with the daily horoscope as well as a weekly show, and she asked Nicola to help her so as to aid him financially.<ref name="HardyEleven"/> In 1982, Hardy began a new weekly broadcast titled ''Entre les lignes, entre les signes'', in which she interviewed a film or music figure using their birth chart, while graphologist Anne-Marie Simmond—whose courses she had taken as well—drew up their psychological portrait using their handwriting.<ref name="HardyTwelve"/> The duo also wrote a book under the same title that compiled the interviews and profiles of the show's guests, first published by RMC in 1986.<ref>{{cite book|title=Entre les lignes, entre les signes|author-link=Françoise Hardy|last1=Hardy|first1=Françoise|last2=Simmond|first2=Annne-Marie|language=French|publisher=[[RMC (France)|RMC Edition]]|year=1986|location=France|isbn=978-2868550064}}</ref><ref name="independent05"/>

In 1990, Hardy continued her astrological work by writing articles in Swiss newspaper ''[[Le Matin (Switzerland)|Le Matin]]'' and by hosting a weekly section in [[Thierry Ardisson]]'s program ''Télé Zèbre'' on [[Antenne 2]].<ref name="QuinoneroPour">Quinonero, 2017, "Là pour personne ?"</ref> On 7 May 2003, Hardy released ''Les rythmes du zodiaque'', which she conceived as "a book that would allow me to make my little contribution to modern astrology."<ref name="HardyEighteen">Hardy, 2018 [2008], "Eighteen"</ref> The making of the book was a laborious and stressful process that took Hardy over two years to write.<ref name="HardyEighteen" />

| quote  = Few splendors remain so long in the memory. If the music of the yé-yé girls was always a jovial gleam that dazzled, that of Françoise Hardy survives as perhaps the most intense due to her sentimental complexity, a whole swirl of past and future nostalgia sung with overwhelming intimacy. Today it seems like one more trifle, but then, back in the sixties of the last century, hearing a song of heartbreak in the mouth of this woman with a sweet and penetrating voice marked a milestone.

Hardy has discussed the intimacies of her family history in depth, including the tragic fate of her father and younger sister.

===Health===
Between late 2004 and early 2005, Hardy was diagnosed with [[MALT lymphoma]],<ref name="avisnon"/><ref name="QuinoneroDefera">Quinonero, 2017 "«Rien ne défera jamais nos liens»"</ref> which inaugurated a "hellish period" that disrupted her life.<ref name="HardyEighteen"/> The singer then underwent [[chemotherapy]] treatment that was initially successful.<ref name="HardyEighteen"/> In March 2015, Hardy's condition worsened and she had to be admitted to the hospital, where she was put into an [[artificial coma]] and nearly died.<ref name="figaroavis"/> During her hospitalization, the singer also broke her hip and elbow.<ref name="figaroavis"/> That month, she told ''Le Figaro'': "I am very isolated, very handicapped by illness. I was diagnosed with lymphoma over ten years ago. But it is especially in the last three years that my symptoms have worsened. I also have a lot of difficulty walking. (...) There are times when I absolutely cannot see anyone and I cannot go out.

Her health has since worsened and in 2021 she made news as a proponent for the legalization of [[physician-assisted suicide]] in France, expressing her desire to have recourse to [[euthanasia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parismatch.com/People/Francoise-Hardy-l-hymne-a-l-amour-1729389|language=French|access-date=6 May 2021|title=Françoise Hardy: "Je n'ai pas peur de mourir mais j'ai très, très peur de souffrir"|work=[[Paris Match]]|date=17 March 2021}}</ref> She told [[RTL (French radio)|RTL]]'s Flavie Flament: "It's absolutely appalling, but for the moment I'm reassured. I manage to cook for myself. As long as I can do that, okay! But if it does become even worse, if I am weakened to the point of not being able to do anything, I would seriously think about euthanasia. I cannot stay like this waiting for death to come, because I cannot live any more. I can't do the things that my life requires."<ref name="diseasertl"/> She also disclosed her inability to continue singing as a result of the effects of the treatments.<ref name="parismatch21"/>

===Politics===
As a public figure, Hardy is known for her frankness regarding her sometimes controversial political views,<ref name="sixties"/> which have been described as [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]].<ref name="QuinoneroDecalages"/><ref name="gay"/> Raised in a [[Gaullist]] family, she told ''Télérama'' in 2011: "I kept that sensitivity. I don't like everything that is said or done on the right, and I don't denigrate everything that is done or said on the [[Left-wing politics|left]]. To be honest, basically I'm pretty [[centrist]]."<ref name="QuinoneroEnfance"/> In her 2008 autobiography, she claimed: "I only identify with [[Environmentalism|ecology]], which I absolutely believe is neither right nor left, but the fact I am not a puppet of the established authority will likely be enough to pigeonhole me."<ref name="HardyThirteen"/>

In promotion of her album ''Décalages'' in 1988, Hardy was interviewed by the magazine ''Rockland'' in a conversation that branched off into political news, as the [[1988 French presidential election|presidential election]] had taken place the day before.<ref name="QuinoneroDecalages"/> Believing that the off-the-record discussion would not be included in the final article, Hardy expressed her contempt for people on the left.<ref name="QuinoneroDecalages"/> Although outraged by the publication of the political conversation, Hardy defended her position on 13 May in a televised interview with [[Thierry Ardisson]], in which she recounted an altercation with singer [[Renaud]], claiming he had insulted her for her support of Minister of Culture [[François Léotard]].<ref name="QuinoneroDecalages"/> In the ''Rockland'' interview, she also caused controversy with her statements about [[racism in France]], claiming that: "we do not talk about [[Anti-French sentiment|anti-French]] racism, that there are places where you are more likely to enter if you are not French";<ref name="QuinoneroDecalages"/> as well as [[antisemitism in France|antisemitism]], suggesting that "those who see it everywhere could actually be sowing its seeds."<ref name="HardyThirteen">Hardy, 2018 [2008], "Thirteen"</ref> The singer later distanced herself from these remarks, writing in her autobiography: "Since then, I have become more aware of the ethnic, social, and cultural differences that separate individuals. However, I still believe that the affinities of the heart and soul weigh more heavily on the scales and also have the marvelous power of transforming opposites into complementarities."<ref name="HardyThirteen"/> 

Hardy was a known opponent of the [[solidarity tax on wealth]] (French: ''impôt de solidarité sur la fortune''; ISF). In 2010, she defended the [[tax shield]] put in place by the government of [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] and, in 2012, caused controversy when denouncing [[François Hollande]]'s tax program amidst the [[2012 French presidential election|presidential elections]], telling ''Paris Match'': "I believe that most people do not realize the tragedy that the ISF causes to people in my category. I am forced, almost 70 years old and ill, to sell my apartment and move out."<ref name="QuinoneroISF"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.france24.com/fr/20120410-programme-fiscal-hollande-deplait-francoise-hardy-chanteuse|title=Françoise Hardy dénonce le programme fiscal de François Hollande|access-date=12 May 2021|date=10 April 2012|publisher=[[France 24]]|first=Ségolène|last=Allemandou|language=French}}</ref> This prompted her son Thomas Dutronc to write on [[Twitter]]: "But no mom, don't worry I'll invite you over to my place just in case...".<ref name="moches"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ThomasDutronc/status/190170066594181121|title=Mais non maman, ne t'inquiète pas je t'inviterais chez moi au cas où...|publisher=[[Thomas Dutronc]] on [[Twitter]]|access-date=12 May 2021|date=11 April 2012}}</ref> Annoyed by the extent of her remarks, the singer later complained: "First, contrary to what has been written, I did not speak of the 'tragedy' of people who pay the ISF. The tragedy is the people who are losing their jobs because of offshoring and the [[European debt crisis|crisis]], and about whom we hear about every day in the newspapers. Then I never said I was going to be homeless. It's absurd. And even less that I was going to go into exile!"<ref name="QuinoneroISF"/>

Hardy has expressed her support for the [[legality of abortion]], while at the same time distancing herself from [[feminism]].<ref name="HardyFive">Hardy, 2018 [2008], "Five"</ref> She wrote in 2008: "It is better to forgo having a child if you are not able to supply the minimum resources and time required for it to develop into a healthy, balanced adult. (...) In contemporary French society, we hear a lot more talk about rights than we do their inseparable duties. This can be seen in how the feminist discourse has advanced the right of women to do as they wish with their own bodies, while passing over in silence — exactly like the puritan position — the fate of the children, although their fate should take precedence over everything else."<ref name="HardyFive"/> In 2015, the singer caused controversy for her criticism of [[Feminist movement|feminist activists]] in her [[essay]] "Avis non autorisés ...", in which she wrote: "I find them surly, ugly, that is to say not feminine for two cents. I have never been able to identify in anything with feminists. There are, however, some that I could have idealized..."<ref name="moches">{{cite web|url=https://www.lesinrocks.com/actu/pour-francoise-hardy-les-feministes-sont-hargneuses-et-moches-363365-06-03-2015/|language=French|work=[[Les Inrockuptibles]]|access-date=12 May 2021|date=6 March 2015|title=Pour Françoise Hardy, les féministes sont " hargneuses " et " moches "|last=Boinet|first=Carole}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/eloise-bouton/francoise-hardy-feminisme_b_6826950.html|title=Françoise Hardy ou la misogynie à l'ancienne|access-date=12 May 2021|date=9 March 2015|work=[[HuffPost]]|first=Éloïse|last=Bouton|language=French}}</ref>

Amidst the [[2017–2018 protests in France]], Hardy expressed her support for President [[Emmanuel Macron]], stating: "We must let him reform France. Part of the French people don’t want to see the reality and are stuck in the [[Marxist ideology]]. What I like about President Macron is that he is an idealist but not an ideologue and is firmly grounded in reality."<ref name="nytimes">{{cite news|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201109041625/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/arts/francoise-hardy-interview.html|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/arts/francoise-hardy-interview.html|archive-date=9 November 2020|access-date=12 May 2021|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Françoise Hardy, a French National Treasure, Is Back from the Brink|date=9 May 2018|first=Agnès C.|last=Poirier}}</ref>
