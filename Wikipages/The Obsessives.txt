== History ==
Made up by best friends Nick Bairatchnyi and Jackson Mansfield, The Obsessives started in 2013 as a two piece band. The outfit was often compared to similar sounding [[Emo]] bands, though Bairatchnyi cites a lot of his early inspiration from the band [[Weatherbox]].<ref name="BlackontheCanvas">{{cite web|url=https://blackonthecanvas.com/2015/01/07/new-infatuation-obsessives/|title=THE OBSESSIVES INTERVIEW|publisher=blackonthecanvas.com|accessdate=2017-08-15}}</ref> They self-released their first EP, ''Die Trying'' on May 2, 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theobsessives.bandcamp.com/album/die-trying|title=Die Trying, by The Obsessives|website=The Obsessives|access-date=2018-09-30}}</ref>
