A follow-up, ''[[Music for Men]]'', was released in 2009. The band play a mix of [[post-punk revival]], [[indie rock]], and [[dance-rock]]. Their last album, ''[[A Joyful Noise (Gossip album)|A Joyful Noise]]'', was released in May 2012.

==History==

===Formation and early history===
Gossip was formed in 1999 in Olympia, Washington, by vocalist [[Beth Ditto]], [[guitarist]] Nathan "Brace Paine" Howdeshell, and [[drummer]] Kathy Mendonça.<ref name="southerncomfort">{{Citation | last = Abreu | first = Amelia | title = Southern Comfort | newspaper = Dallas Observed | date = 2001-02-08 | url = http://www.dallasobserver.com/2001-02-08/music/southern-comfort/ | access-date = 2010-03-25}}</ref>
All three were originally from [[Searcy, Arkansas]]; Mendonça moved to Olympia to attend [[Evergreen State College]] and Howdeshell and Ditto followed.<ref name="southerncomfort"/> Howdeshell and Mendonça had been in bands together in Arkansas.<ref>{{Citation | last = Coble | first = Margaret | title = Hot Gossip | journal = The Advocate | date = 2001-02-13 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tWMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA51}}</ref> Gossip coalesced when the three members were roommates in Olympia.<ref name="southerncomfort"/>
 
In 1999, the [[independent record label]] [[K Records]] released Gossip's first recording, their debut [[Extended play|EP]] ''The Gossip'', to coincide with the band's tour with [[Sleater-Kinney]].<ref name="southerncomfort"/>
Gossip played at the first [[Ladyfest]] in Olympia in August 2000 and was included in Time Magazine's article on the festival.<ref>{{cite magazine | last = Nugent | first = Benjamin | title = Olympia Ladystyle | magazine = Time | date = 2000-07-30 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,51245-1,00.html| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20010214034726/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,51245-1,00.html| url-status = dead| archive-date = February 14, 2001}}</ref>

Their next record was the debut studio album ''[[That's Not What I Heard]]'', released by the label [[Kill Rock Stars]] on January 23, 2001. They followed it with the EP ''Arkansas Heat'' on May 7, 2002. ''[[Movement (The Gossip album)|Movement]]'', their second studio album, was released on May 6, 2003. In November 2003, two months after the release of their first live album ''[[Undead in NYC]]'' on September 9, drummer Kathy Mendonça left the band to pursue a career as a [[midwife]]. Established punk drummer [[Hannah Blilie]] joined to replace her. The band then dropped "The" from their name, continuing as plain "Gossip".{{citation needed|date=November 2013|reason=Dating the name-change would be a big improvement.}}

The first release featuring new drummer Hannah Blilie was the band's next album, ''[[Standing in the Way of Control]]''. It was released on January 24, 2006 on Kill Rock Stars and later in 2006 on UK independent label Back Yard Recordings. The record was produced by [[Ryan Hadlock]], owner of [[Bear Creek Studio]], and [[Fugazi]] singer/guitarist [[Guy Picciotto]].

===2007–2011: Mainstream success and moving to a major label===
[[File:Ditto in 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Gossip at the London Barfly, 16 May 2007]]
The album ''Standing in the Way of Control'' has earned Gold Record Status in the UK. Gossip's first UK TV appearance was on BBC1's ''[[Friday Night With Jonathan Ross]]'', where they performed the title track "[[Standing in the Way of Control (song)|Standing in the Way of Control]]".

As reported on ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' in March 2007, the group signed to Music With a Twist, a subsidiary of Sony Music Label Group, concentrating on [[LGBT]] music acts.<ref>Phillips, Amy [http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/41616 "Pitchfork News "The Gossip Sign to Columbia"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320131946/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/41616 |date=2007-03-20 }}, ''[[Pitchfork Media]]'', March 8, 2007.</ref>
During the summer of 2007, Gossip was a part of the multi-artist [[True Colors Tour 2007]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truecolorstour.com/ |title=True Colors Tour 2007 |publisher=Truecolorstour.com |access-date=2012-02-22}}</ref> which traveled through 15 cities in the United States and Canada. Hosted by comedian [[Margaret Cho]] and headlined by [[Cyndi Lauper]], the tour also included [[Debbie Harry]], [[Erasure]], [[Rufus Wainwright]], [[The Dresden Dolls]], [[The MisShapes]], [[The Cliks]], and special guests. Profits from the tour went to benefit the [[Human Rights Campaign]].

Gossip is based in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] and has played with bands such as [[Sleater-Kinney]], [[Le Tigre]], [[CSS (band)|CSS]], [[Erase Errata]], [[Mika Miko]], Panther, Comanechi, and [[Mates of State]]. They also opened for [[Scissor Sisters]] on three dates of their November 2006 tour.

On June 24, 2007 Gossip closed the [[Glastonbury Festival]], playing the final set on the John Peel stage during which Ditto gave a tribute to the late [[John Peel]]. The band also performed the following year, on the Pyramid Stage.

Gossip launched their ''Live in Liverpool'' album in the UK and the U.S. in April 2008. The album was produced by [[Rick Rubin]] and also features a DVD of their live performance. A new studio album called ''[[Music For Men]]'' was released in June 2009. The first single from the album, "[[Heavy Cross]]", was especially successful in Germany where it was certified triple gold<ref>[http://www.musikindustrie.de/gold_platin_datenbank/?action=suche&strTitel=Heavy+Cross&strInterpret=&strTtArt=&strAwards=checked data base] of Bundesverband Musikindustrie (German)</ref> for selling over 450,000 copies, and was mentioned as the "most successful internationally produced single" of all time in September 2010.<ref>[http://www.gfk-entertainment.com/news/single-rekord-fuer-gossip.html press text] released by media control (German)</ref> In January 2011 the single broke the German record for the longest-selling track in chart history.
