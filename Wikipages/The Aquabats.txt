'''The Aquabats''' are an American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Huntington Beach, California]] in 1994. Throughout many fluctuations in the group's line-up, singer [[Christian Jacobs|The MC Bat Commander]] and bassist [[Chad Larson|Crash McLarson]] have remained the band's two constant fixtures. Since 2006, The Aquabats' members also include keyboardist [[James Briggs (musician)|Jimmy the Robot]], drummer [[Richard Falomir|Ricky Fitness]] and guitarist [[Ian Fowles|Eaglebones Falconhawk]].

Easily identified by their masks and matching costumes, The Aquabats are perhaps most recognized for their comedic persona in which they claim to be crime-fighting [[superhero]]es. This theme serves as subject for much of the band's music and as part of their theatrical stage shows, which typically feature various stunts and fight scenes with costumed villains and monsters. Musically, The Aquabats have continuously evolved over the course of their career, starting as an eight-member [[ska]] band before reinventing themselves in the early 2000s as a [[New wave music|new wave]]-influenced rock quintet. The band's current musical style mixes rock and [[punk rock|punk]] with elements of new wave, ska and [[synth-pop]].

The Aquabats have released six studio albums, two extended plays, one compilation and one soundtrack album, among [[The Aquabats discography|other recordings]]. To date, three of The Aquabats' albums have charted on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]: 1997's ''[[The Fury of The Aquabats!]]'', 2011's ''[[Hi-Five Soup!]]'' and 2019's ''[[The Aquabats! Super Show! Television Soundtrack: Volume One]]''. The Aquabats' sixth studio album, ''[[Kooky Spooky...In Stereo]]'', was released on August 21, 2020.

From 2012 to 2014, The Aquabats also created and starred in ''[[The Aquabats! Super Show!]]'', a live-action musical action-comedy television series which aired on American cable channel [[Discovery Family|The Hub]]. The series ran for three seasons, earning a total of eight [[Daytime Emmy Award]] nominations and ultimately winning one. Following a successful [[Kickstarter]] campaign, the series was independently revived as a biweekly [[YouTube]] series in late 2019.

==History==

===Formation===
[[File:13-04-27 Aquabats 17.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Singer [[Christian Jacobs]] and bassist [[Chad Larson]] (pictured above in 2013) formed The Aquabats with former trumpeter [[Boyd Terry]] as a joke band in 1994.]]
In the early 1990s, musicians [[Christian Jacobs]], [[Chad Larson]] and [[Boyd Terry]] met and befriended each other while living in [[Brea, California]].<ref name="Saturday Morning">{{cite web|title=The Aquabats' Saturday Morning Mission; Who Are Those Masked Men?

With Jacobs assuming vocal duties, Larson on bass guitar and Terry on trumpet, the trio recruited several more musician friends from other local bands to piece together a full ensemble. Each member of the original line-up had musical backgrounds in various genres, including ska, punk, [[surf music|surf]] and [[New wave music|new wave]], all elements which were incorporated into the band's music and aesthetic:<ref name="TLCCrash">{{cite web |url=http://www.tlchicken.com/view_story.php?ARTid=2615 |title=The Aquabats' Crash McLarson |date=August 2004 |publisher=Tastes Like Chicken}}</ref><ref name="eNotesBats">{{cite web |url=http://www.enotes.com/aquabats-reference/aquabats |title=The Aquabats— eNotes |publisher=[[eNotes]] |year=1997}}</ref> for example, the name "The Aquabats" was created to sound like a classic surf band, while a shared admiration of [[Devo]] inspired the idea of matching costumes.<ref name="Saturday Morning" /><ref name="CrashMcLinterview">{{cite web |url=http://www.splendidmagazine.com/departments/shorttalk/aquabats.html |title=A Short Talk with The Aquabats' Crash McLarsen |publisher=Splendid Magazine |year=2005 |author=Sullivan, Sean |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211224557/http://www.splendidmagazine.com/departments/shorttalk/aquabats.html |archive-date=February 11, 2008 }}</ref> Jacobs simply recalled in a 2013 interview, "We wanted to combine Devo with surf music and ska".<ref name="LATimesBat2013">{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-return-of-the-aquabats-interview-20130613,0,2302339.story |title=Return of the Aquabats, Interview II: The Q&A |date=June 15, 2013 |author=Lloyd, Robert |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> Rehearsing only once in a house Jacobs and Larson shared at the time, The Aquabats played their first show a mere week after forming at a house party in August 1994.<ref name="Saturday Morning" /><ref name="NitroBio">{{cite web |url=http://www.nitrorecords.com/artist.php?artist_id=26 |publisher=[[Nitro Records]] |title=The Aquabats biography— Nitro Records}}</ref> Larson remembered this show as merely "a joke...we weren't trying to be a band. We were trying to have fun".<ref name="Saturday Morning" /> Nevertheless, encouraged by a positive audience reception, The Aquabats started performing more local shows, soon becoming familiar faces within the Orange County underground.

===1994–1996: Early years===
With professionalism far from foremost concern, The Aquabats' earliest band line-ups changed with almost every concert, occasionally featuring as many as twelve to fourteen musicians at a time onstage, with the majority typically playing brass instruments.<ref name="NitroBio" /><ref name="MCBCheadExplode">{{cite news |url=http://www.ocweekly.com/2012-03-01/music/aquabats-super-show-mc-bat-commander-christian-jacobs/2/ |title=MC Bat Commander's Head Explodes! |newspaper=[[OC Weekly]] |date=March 1, 2012 |access-date=May 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506194409/http://www.ocweekly.com/2012-03-01/music/aquabats-super-show-mc-bat-commander-christian-jacobs/2/ |archive-date=May 6, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> As they gradually developed a steady following and began playing shows with more regularity, the band settled into a tighter and more manageable unit consisting of around eight to nine musicians, filled out by a [[horn section]], two guitarists and a keyboardist. It was with this type of line-up that The Aquabats began recording, independently producing the [[Demo (music)|demo tapes]] [[The Aquabats discography#Demos|''The Revenge of the Midget Punchers'']] in 1994 and [[The Aquabats discography#Demos|''Bat Boy'']] in 1995.

[[File:13-04-27 Aquabats 15.jpg|thumb|250px|left|As part of the band's [[superhero]] image, each member of The Aquabats adopted a [[stage name]] and backstory. Christian Jacobs' alter ego is "The MC Bat Commander", whose trademark look includes a drawn-on mustache and blacked-out tooth.]]
Initially, The Aquabats intended to make each of their performances unique by wearing a different set of matching costumes for every concert, ranging from [[chef's uniform]]s to [[grass skirt]]s and [[fez (hat)|fezzes]], all with an individual persona — during one show wearing chef outfits, for instance, the band hosted an actual onstage [[barbecue]].<ref name="LATimesBat2013" /><ref name="MCBCheadExplode" /> When the group's props and get-ups soon became more cumbersome to transport than their musical equipment, it was ultimately decided a singular costume was required.<ref name="MCBCheadExplode" /> Terry, a future apparel designer who was employed by the wetsuit manufacturing company [[Aleeda]] at the time, acquired a large amount of spare rubber and [[neoprene]] and fashioned together a set of helmets and [[rashguard]]s for the band members.<ref name="eNotesBats" /><ref name="NitroBio" /> The addition of customized vinyl belts, donated to the band by then-unknown artist [[Paul Frank]], effectively completed the style The Aquabats would maintain for the rest of their career.<ref name="TLCCrash" />

To accompany their distinct new uniforms, The Aquabats constructed a backstory which alleged they were actually [[superhero]]es hailing from the distant island of "Aquabania", though Larson admits the entire mythology was simply made up piece by piece as they went along from one interviewer to the next.<ref name="CrashMcLinterview" /> As their mythology grew, the members soon adopted superhero [[stage name]]s and identities, and began tailoring their live shows around a comic book aesthetic by incorporating onstage stunts and mock battles with costumed villains, antics which were originally ploys to get the band's friends into shows for free.<ref name="MCBCheadExplode" /><ref name="GetInspired">{{cite web |url=http://startupgrind.com/2012/04/get-inspired-aquabats-founder-turns-his-high-school-band-into-a-wacky-empire/ |title=Aquabats Founder Turns His High School Band Into a Wacky Empire |date=April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510124836/http://startupgrind.com/2012/04/get-inspired-aquabats-founder-turns-his-high-school-band-into-a-wacky-empire/ |archive-date=May 10, 2012 }}</ref> Jacobs' brothers [[Parker Jacobs|Parker]] and Tyler, a [[cartoonist]] and [[graphic designer|graphic artist]], respectively, were brought in to help develop the band's cartoon-influenced visual style, designing their logos and promotional material as well as playing characters in The Aquabats' stage shows and mythology.<ref name="MCBCheadExplode" />

In 1995, The Aquabats independently produced and recorded their debut album, ''[[The Return of The Aquabats]]'', pressing the CDs themselves. Having already amassed a sizable [[cult following]] for their increasingly eccentric live shows, the band managed to sell a respectable 20,000 copies of their album without any marketing or distribution.<ref name="GetInspired" /> With the growing mainstream popularity of ska music, The Aquabats quickly rose to prominence within Orange County's booming ska scene, regularly touring alongside the likes of such commercially successful bands as [[No Doubt]], [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]] and [[Reel Big Fish]] and bringing them to the brink of achieving mainstream recognition.<ref name="Saturday Morning" /><ref name="MCBCheadExplode" />

===1997–1998: ''The Fury of The Aquabats!'' and mainstream breakthrough===
[[File:TravisBarker 9.19.2008.JPG|thumb|right|125px|Drummer [[Travis Barker]] was a member of The Aquabats during their commercial peak in 1997 and 1998, before leaving to join pop punk band [[Blink-182]].]]
By late 1996, propelled by the multi-platinum success of No Doubt and Sublime, ska had broken through into the American mainstream to become one of the most popular forms of alternative music.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/third-wave-ska-revival-d2773 |title=Explore: Third Wave Ska Revival |publisher=[[allmusic]].com}}</ref> With record labels now turning their attention towards ska bands, The Aquabats were promptly signed to [[Goldenvoice]] Records and released their second album, ''[[The Fury of The Aquabats!]]'', in October 1997 through [[Time Bomb Recordings]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/sep/28/entertainment/ca-36945 |title=Mining Gold |date=September 28, 1997 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> While still predominantly a ska album, ''The Fury'' showcased a more ambitious musical streak than ''The Return'', incorporating stronger elements of punk and surf, as well as featuring [[instrumental]]s, parodies of [[ragtime]] and [[tango music]], and a variety of unconventional instruments including [[sousaphone]]s and [[banjo]]s.<ref name="Saturday Morning" /><ref name="CrashMcLinterview"/> Released at the commercial height of the American ska revival, ''The Fury'' earned The Aquabats minor mainstream success, peaking at number 172 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and number 12 on its [[Top Heatseekers]], while lead single "[[Super Rad!]]" found regular airplay on [[MTV]] and Los Angeles' influential [[KROQ-FM]].<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p210908|pure_url=yes}}|title=allmusic ((( The Aquabats > Charts & Awards > Billboard Albums )))|access-date=December 9, 2008}}</ref><ref name="Saturday Morning" /> On July 25, 1998, they fought the alien rock band [[Gwar]] during The Ska Parade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonska.net/news/gwar-vs-the-aquabats/1336/ |title=GWAR vs The Aquabats on The Ska Parade; RIP Dave Brockie {{pipe}} Boston Ska (dot) net |website=Bostonska.net |date=2014-03-24 |access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>

The Aquabats spent 1997 and 1998 touring extensively behind ''The Fury'', carrying out both supporting and headlining tours of the United States and traveling internationally as part of the 1998 [[Warped Tour]].  By this time, the band had settled into a stable touring line-up of Jacobs (The Bat Commander), Larson (Crash McLarson), Terry (Catboy), drummer [[Travis Barker]] (The Baron Von Tito), guitarists [[Charles Gray (musician)|Charles Gray]] (Ultra Kyu) and [[Courtney Pollock]] (Chainsaw, the Prince of Karate), trumpeter [[Adam Deibert]] (Prince Adam) and keyboardist/saxophonist [[James Briggs (musician)|James Briggs]] (Jaime the Robot, later Jimmy the Robot).<ref name="AquabatsAllmusicBio">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-aquabats-p210908/biography |title=The Aquabats biography |publisher=[[allmusic]].com}}</ref> This line-up would last The Aquabats up until 1998, when, in the middle of a tour with [[pop punk]] trio [[Blink-182]], Blink unexpectedly fired their drummer [[Scott Raynor]] and recruited Barker as a last-minute replacement to sit in for the rest of the tour. By the tour's close, the band was so impressed with Barker's performance that they invited him to join Blink-182 as a full-time member, an offer which Barker accepted, amicably parting ways with The Aquabats.<ref name="Justice">{{cite news|title=The Aquabats fight for justice and good punk|last=Chun|first=Gary|date=May 10, 2002|newspaper=[[The Honolulu Star Bulletin]]|publisher=Oahu Publications Inc.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Blink-182, Aquabats Play Musical Drummers |work=MTV.com |date=July 14, 1998 |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1424999/19980714/aquabats.jhtml |access-date=August 23, 2007}}</ref> Barker was succeeded by Gabe Palmer (Doctor Rock), solidifying a line-up which would last the remainder of the decade.

With the band now finding enough success to generate both an adequate income and media visibility, Jacobs — a former [[child actor]] with ties in the entertainment industry — began to conceive the idea of adapting The Aquabats' superhero mythology into a television series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nerdreactor.com/2012/04/03/nr-interview-the-aquabats-christian-jacobs-aka-the-mc-bat-commander/ |title=NR Interview: The Aquabats' Christian Jacobs, AKA The MC Bat Commander |publisher=Nerd Reactor |date=April 3, 2012 |author=Nguyen, John}}</ref> After pitching the concept to several networks, [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television|Buena Vista Television]] eventually agreed to help produce a short live-action [[television pilot|pilot]] in 1998, directed by comedian [[Bobcat Goldthwait]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bell, Carrie |date=May 16, 1998 |title=Still Skanking |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=110 |issue=20 |pages=78–79}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1425000/aquabats-hook-up-with-bobcat-tv-pilot.jhtml |title=Aquabats Hook Up With Bobcat For TV Pilot |publisher=[[MTV.com]] |date=July 8, 1998}}</ref> Titled simply ''The Aquabats!'', the pilot followed the fictional misadventures of the eight band members in an intentionally [[camp (style)|campy]] style similar to [[Saturday morning cartoon]] shows.<ref name="ComicConVideo">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur4AeawJSTw |title=The Aquabats— Comic-Con 2011 |publisher=[[The Hub (TV channel)|The Hub]] |date=July 2011}}</ref> The pilot, which has yet to be made available for public viewing, failed to attract any network interest and was later openly disowned by the band themselves.<ref name="ComicConVideo" />

===1999–2004: Change in genre, career decline and semi-hiatus===
By the time The Aquabats began writing new material for their next studio album in 1998, the group had begun to feel [[pigeonholing|pigeonholed]] by their public status as a "cheesy ska band" and consciously decided to start exploring more diverse musical styles rather than merely returning to a ska-based sound.<ref name="CrashMcLinterview" /> As such, the band's third album, ''[[The Aquabats vs. the Floating Eye of Death!]]'', marked an abrupt stylistic shift, completely abandoning the ska rhythms which dominated their previous albums in favor of more punk and new wave-influenced textures, emphasizing guitar and [[synthesizer]]-driven melodies over brass and woodwinds. With the total absence of The Aquabats' formerly marketable ska sound, Goldenvoice expressed mixed feelings over ''Floating Eye'', reportedly telling the band that the album had no potential single material and would be difficult to promote.<ref name="CrashMcLinterview" /> In a 2005 interview, Larson retrospectively lamented upon ''Floating Eye''{{'}}s lack of a commercial sound, noting that while he and the band felt the material was strong, it "probably wasn't the record we should have put out at that time".<ref name="CrashMcLinterview" />

True to their predictions, ''Floating Eye'' failed to match the commercial success of its predecessor, charting only at a mere 35 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Top Heatseekers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allmusic.com/album/aquabats-vs-the-floating-eye-of-death-r442255/charts-awards |title=Aquabats Vs. the Floating Eye of Death! > Charts & Awards |publisher=[[allmusic]].com}}</ref> Despite the album's underwhelming performance, Goldenvoice nevertheless granted The Aquabats a small budget for a music video, which the band instead used to film a five-minute promotional video as another prospective television pilot, ''[[The Aquabats! Super Show!#History and previous attempts at a series|The Aquabats! In Color!]]'', an action-oriented series styled similarly to Japanese [[tokusatsu]] shows. Despite potential interest from the [[ABC Family|Fox Family Channel]] prior to their acquisition by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] which cancelled all development deals, the pilot again failed to generate any interest, bringing The Aquabats' career to a standstill.<ref name="ComicConVideo" /><ref name="LAtimesBats">{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/tv/la-ca-aquabats-20120226,0,5306168.story |title=Fighting for truth, justice the silly way |date=February 26, 2012 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |author=Ito, Robert}}</ref>
[[File:13-04-27_Aquabats_13.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Richard Falomir]] (Ricky Fitness) joined the band during their career lull in 2002, eventually serving the longest tenure of any Aquabats drummer.]]
Following the huge financial losses Goldenvoice suffered from the inaugural [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] in 1999, the company was eventually forced to cease operations, leaving the Aquabats without a record label.<ref name="Justice"/><ref name="MishMashBats">{{cite web |url=http://www.mishmashmagazine.com/2005/music/interviews/the-aquabats-interview/ |title=The Aquabats: Interview |publisher=Mish Mash Magazine |date=July 28, 2005}}</ref> After an unsuccessful search for a new label, the band eventually turned to the Internet to independently manage and promote themselves while the members resumed their day jobs to continue funding the band.<ref name="Justice"/><ref name="MishMashBats"/> Jacobs likened the experience to a superhero's [[alter ego]], working by day and fighting crime [read: being an Aquabat] by night.<ref name="Justice"/> While The Aquabats could not secure a proper recording contract, the band did negotiate a [[distribution deal]] with [[Fearless Records]], releasing a collection of outtakes and demos from the ''Floating Eye'' sessions entitled ''[[Myths, Legends, and Other Amazing Adventures, Vol. 2]]'' before slipping back into a period of relative inactivity.

With a lack of label support leaving the band to finance themselves entirely out of pocket, The Aquabats indefinitely postponed all plans for future recording or extensive touring, limiting their activity primarily to sporadic shows in the southwest United States.<ref name="MishMashBats" /> The loss of touring income, coupled with the band members' return to their jobs and families, eventually contributed to the departure of several key members: in 2000, guitarist Gray left the band, followed by Palmer and co-founder Terry in 2002.<ref name="MishMashBats" /> To avoid the financial constraints of hiring two new members, Adam Deibert assumed a dual role as trumpeter and guitarist for the band's live shows, while Palmer was replaced by former Assorted Jelly Beans drummer [[Richard Falomir|Ricky Falomir]] (Ricky Fitness). With this more stable and compact line-up, The Aquabats returned to the studio to record original music for [[Evan Dorkin]]{{'}}s ''[[Welcome to Eltingville]]'', a 2002 animated television pilot which aired on [[Adult Swim]] but was ultimately not picked up as a series. The following year, the band would release their first DVD, ''[[Serious Awesomeness!]]'', featuring a full live performance filmed in [[Pomona, California]] and numerous clips spanning their entire career.

In 2004, with almost five years passed since having released any official studio material, The Aquabats independently recorded and released the five-track [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Yo! Check Out This Ride! EP|Yo! Check Out This Ride!]]'' as an attempt to both satisfy the band's fanbase and serve as a potential demo to attract interest from record labels.<ref name="MishMashBats" /> As their first recording with only six members and no use of a horn section, ''Yo! Check Out This Ride!'' marked the most drastic shift yet in The Aquabats' sound, taking the band even further into keyboard-driven rock and new wave-influenced songwriting.<ref name="MishMashBats" /> This would also mark Deibert's final recording with the band, as he would officially retire from the group later in the year, reducing The Aquabats to a quintet.<ref name="MishMashBats" />

===2005–2009: ''Charge!!'' and renewed success===
[[File:The Aquabats 4.JPG|thumb|left|250px|The departure of [[Adam Deibert]] in 2004 left The Aquabats a five-piece, effectively changing the band's sound and setting the stage for their career rejuvenation with ''Charge!!''.]]
In the summer of 2004, The Aquabats were signed to independent label [[Nitro Records]] and began work on a new studio album in the fall.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.punknews.org/article/9610 |title=Nitro Records signs The Aquabats |publisher=Punknews.org |date=July 4, 2004}}</ref> Despite this fortuitous turn of events, the group were still uncertain of their future following their semi-hiatus and radical shift in line-up; Jacobs later admitted that the band spent the recording sessions under the belief that it could possibly be their last album.<ref name="ComicConVideo" /> After several months of production and much online hype, The Aquabats released their fourth album, ''[[Charge!!]]'', on July 7, 2005. Continuing with the direction set by ''Yo! Check Out This Ride!'', ''Charge!!'' was a bold introduction to The Aquabats' new musical style of guitar-driven, new wave-influenced rock.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nitrorecords.com/news.php?id=39 |publisher=[[Nitro Records]] |date=April 1, 2005 |title=April 1, 2005— THE AQUABATS— CHARGE!! New album details}}</ref>

Released to a largely positive critical reception with many critics praising the band's shift in genre, ''Charge!!'' effectively revitalized The Aquabats' career as the band recommitted themselves to regular touring. Days after the album's release, The Aquabats headlined a successful 34-city tour of the United States with similarly theatrical bands [[The Epoxies]] and [[The Phenomenauts]], followed by tours of the United Kingdom and Japan, the latter supporting Nitro Records founders [[The Offspring]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theaquabats.com/news/072805.html |publisher=theaquabats.com |title=TheAquabats.com news update |date=July 28, 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611021510/http://theaquabats.com/news/072805.html |archive-date=June 11, 2012 }}</ref> On September 23, 2005, The Aquabats made their national television debut on the [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] program ''[[Attack of the Show]]'', performing ''Charge!!''{{'}}s lead single, "[[Fashion Zombies!]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.g4tv.com/attackoftheshow/episodes/4500/ronald-d-moore-danica-mckellar-the-aquabats.html |publisher=[[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]].com |title=Attack of the Show episode guide— September 23, 2005}}</ref>

While the following year would present even more lucrative touring opportunities for The Aquabats, the band's renewed success would also have its drawbacks. In May 2006, it was announced that guitarist Pollock had reluctantly departed the group after 12 years, claiming the band's increased touring activity was conflicting with his business schedule. Pollock was succeeded by former [[Death by Stereo]] member [[Ian Fowles]] (Eaglebones Falconhawk), though he would continue to contribute guitar tracks to The Aquabats' studio albums and perform with the band as a second guitarist for their southern California concerts and major festival shows.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ampmagazine.com/4839/the-aquabats-interview-with-the-mc-bat-commander-by-tyler-evans/ |work=[[AMP (magazine)|AMP]]|title=The Aquabats – Interview with the MC Bat Commander |date=October 11, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227024548/http://www.ampmagazine.com/4839/the-aquabats-interview-with-the-mc-bat-commander-by-tyler-evans/ |archive-date=December 27, 2010 }}</ref> After releasing a limited-print tongue-in-cheek "One Year Anniversary Edition" of ''Charge!!'', The Aquabats carried out another national tour before announcing a brief hiatus in January 2007 to focus on writing their next album.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.punknews.org/article/16467/aquabats-to-re-release-charge-add-more-tour-dates |title=Aquabats to re-release "Charge!!," add more tour dates |date=March 26, 2006 |publisher=Punknews.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.punknews.org/article/21682 |title=Aquabats announce "last" show before they "go underground" |publisher=Punknews.org |date=January 10, 2007}}</ref>

During this period, Jacobs had been pursuing a career in television production with his creative partner and longtime Aquabats collaborator [[Scott Schultz (producer)|Scott Schultz]], independently filming prospective pilots for family television shows. In 2007, Jacobs and Schultz successfully sold one of their pilots, a preschooler show called ''[[Yo Gabba Gabba!]]'', to [[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]]{{'}}s [[Nick Jr.]] channel. As a musically oriented program, ''Yo Gabba Gabba!'' featured several guest appearances by The Aquabats, appearing onscreen performing both old and new songs and starring in various sketches. The series went on to become an award-winning international sensation, bringing a generous amount of media attention towards both Jacobs and The Aquabats, just enough to persuade ''Gabba''{{'}}s production company [[Wild Brain]] to help produce a new pilot again based on the band.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ocregister.com/entertainment/aquabats-342894-jacobs-says.html |author=Larsen, Peter |title=O.C.'s Aquabats go from stage to screen |newspaper=[[The Orange County Register]] |date=March 2, 2012}}</ref><ref name=assemb>{{cite web |url=http://geek-news.mtv.com/2012/03/01/interview-christian-jacobs-assembles-the-the-aquabats-super-show |title=MTV Geek— Interview: Christian Jacobs Assembles 'The Aquabats!

Shot on location throughout California in early 2008, The Aquabats' third television pilot, titled ''[[The Aquabats! Super Show!]]'', was a fully realized half-hour episode featuring both live-action and animated storylines starring and featuring original music by the band. The Aquabats spent the remainder of 2008 heavily promoting the ''Super Show!'' pilot through extensive [[viral marketing|viral advertising]] and further touring, including appearances at the 2008 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], where the pilot was publicly debuted for fans, high-profile festivals including the [[Bamboozle Left]] and [[Groezrock]] in April 2009, and opening for Blink-182 on two dates of their [[Blink-182 in Concert|2009 reunion tour]].

Though The Aquabats continued to be a popular touring draw, the band experienced a tumultuous period of pre-production on their proposed fifth studio album lasting for nearly two years. Though a July 2007 news update announced that preliminary recording had already begun, no new material ever surfaced from these sessions or was ever performed live.<ref>{{cite web |title=News Update July 26, 2007— The Aquabats Refuse to Quit! |publisher=www.theaquabats.com |date=July 26, 2007}}</ref> As the band resumed touring throughout the United States and Europe, fewer updates were reported on the album's progress until all plans were abruptly ceased in April 2009, when The Aquabats were dropped from Nitro Records due to "trying economic times and a struggling musical landscape", according to Jacobs.<ref name="aquabats leave nitro">{{cite web|title = The Aquabats! leave Nitro|publisher = Punknews.org|url = http://www.punknews.org/article/32948|date = April 3, 2009|access-date = April 10, 2009}}</ref> With a glum confirmation of "no record company, no record", The Aquabats' future seemed once again shadowed in doubt.<ref name="aquabats leave nitro" />

Despite the lack of a record label, The Aquabats continued to tour internationally throughout 2010 and 2011, headlining tours of the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as appearing at the 2010 [[Soundwave (Australian music festival)|Soundwave]] festival in Australia — the band's first ever visit to the continent. In August 2010, The Aquabats suddenly announced on their website that they would be independently releasing their next studio album in November of that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theaquabats.com/news |title=The Aquabats news |publisher=theaquabats.com |access-date=August 13, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128071648/http://theaquabats.com/news/ |archive-date=November 28, 2010 }}</ref> However, following a last-minute distribution deal with [[Fearless Records]], the album's release date was postponed to 2011 to provide for proper marketing and promotion, and an EP containing its first single, ''[[Radio Down!]]'', was released in its place.<ref>{{cite web |title = The Aquabats Official Website— October 2010 Update |date = October 28, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = The Aquabats— Interview with the MC Bat Commander by Tyler Evans|work='[[AMP (magazine)|AMP]]|url = http://www.ampmagazine.com/4839/the-aquabats-interview-with-the-mc-bat-commander-by-tyler-evans/|date = October 11, 2010|access-date = October 11, 2010|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101227024548/http://www.ampmagazine.com/4839/the-aquabats-interview-with-the-mc-bat-commander-by-tyler-evans/|archive-date = December 27, 2010}}</ref> ''[[Hi-Five Soup!]]'', The Aquabats' fifth full-length album, was released on January 18, 2011, becoming the band's highest-charting album since ''The Fury'', debuting at number 181 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and number 5 on Top Heatseekers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allmusic.com/album/hi-five-soup-r2102455/charts-awards |title=Hi-Five Soup!— The Aquabats > Charts & Awards |website=[[allmusic]]}}</ref> In promotion of the album, the band embarked on a 21-city national tour supporting [[Reel Big Fish]], followed by a performance at the 2011 [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]].

On March 24, 2011, it was formally announced via [[press release]] that ''[[The Aquabats!

After spending the majority of 2011 in production, the first season of ''The Aquabats! Super Show!'' ran for thirteen episodes from March 3, 2012 to June 16, 2012, meeting with a largely positive critical reception and consistently high ratings for the modestly sized channel, eventually earning a [[Daytime Emmy]] nomination for Outstanding Children's Series, which it ultimately lost to fellow Hub series ''[[The Haunting Hour: The Series|R.

In a ''[[The Huffington Post|Huffington Post]]'' feature on the band prior to the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]], Jacobs revealed that The Hub had opted not to renew ''The Aquabats! Super Show!'' for another season following extensive network [[rebranding]] by Hasbro and Discovery, effectively canceling the series. Jacobs admitted he was surprised by this turn of events, noting "Everything we heard was that the show has been a real Cinderella story for the Hub and that it was rating really well with viewers. We just assumed that we'd eventually go back into production or at least get picked up for Season 3", but ultimately concluded "it is what it is" in regard to the network's decision.<ref name="HuffAqua">{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-hill/the-aquabats-celebrate-th_b_5615811.html |title=The Aquabats!

===2014–2018: Continued touring and anniversary shows===
Since the 2012 premiere of ''The Aquabats! Super Show!'', The Aquabats largely cut back on extensive touring in order to accommodate their television production schedule, once again limiting their live shows to occasional performances within the Southwestern United States. In April 2013, the band carried out a six-show tour of Europe and the United Kingdom, concluding with an appearance at the [[Groezrock]] punk rock festival in [[Belgium]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.punknews.org/article/51019/tours-the-aquabats-europe |title=Tours: The Aquabats (Europe) |publisher=Punknews.org |date=March 21, 2013}}</ref> The following June, The Aquabats were once again featured on the [[Warped Tour]], though only played eight shows in the Southwest region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://punkmusic.about.com/od/warpedtour2013/a/The-2013-Vans-Warped-Tour-Lineup.htm |title=The 2013 Vans Warped Tour Lineup |publisher=[[About.com]]}}</ref> Despite playing a limited portion of the tour, the band were regularly featured on the second season of [[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse]]{{'}}s ''[[Warped Roadies]]'', a reality series documenting the [[road crew]] of the Warped Tour, where they were most notably the subject of one episode in which they incur the wrath of a stage manager for repeatedly playing over their set times.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3409568/ |title="Warped Roadies" Terry Is An Idiot |publisher=[[Internet Movie DataBase]]}}</ref>

On March 17, 2014, in celebration of their 20th anniversary as a band, The Aquabats announced the first leg of their "20th Anniversary Tour" for May, their first extensive headlining United States tour in years, covering fifteen shows in nine states on the East Coast.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aquabatsblog.tumblr.com/post/79909769329/brand-new-tour-dates |title=Brand new tour dates! |publisher=[[Tumblr]] |author=The Aquabats |date=March 17, 2014}}</ref> The following July, the band carried out five more dates across California, Washington and Oregon, then announced eleven more dates covering six states across the western half of the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aquabatsblog.tumblr.com/post/90432545165/are-you-in-the-west-coast-and-feeling-a-little |title=Untitled blog entry |publisher=[[Tumblr]] |date=July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://aquabatsblog.tumblr.com/post/91089320660/new-the-aquabats-tour-dates-ca-az-ut-nv-co-tx |title=New Aquabats tour dates |date=July 2014 |publisher=[[Tumblr]]}}</ref>

Following another stretch of relative inactivity for most of 2015 and 2016, The Aquabats announced a 13-date tour of the American Midwest and East Coast in May 2017, supported by [[Reggie and the Full Effect]], [[C. J. Ramone]] and [[Kepi Ghoulie]], subsequently followed by a six-date tour of the West Coast in October with [[Dog Party (band)|Dog Party]]. Ticket options for these shows included "Super Rad Packages" with bonus exclusive merchandise, most notably a split [[single (music)|7" single]] of full-length versions of the ''Super Show!'' songs "[[Burger Rain]]" and "Beat Fishin'", The Aquabats' first new studio recordings since 2011's ''Hi-Five Soup''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/theaquabats/photos/a.272474334291.140927.13162339291/10155374482989292/?type=3 |title=The Aquabats! - Posts |date=May 11, 2017 |publisher=[[Facebook]]}}</ref> In mid-February 2018, The Aquabats played nine dates in the [[United Kingdom]] with [[Army of Freshmen]] supporting [[Bowling for Soup]] on their "Get Happy!" tour.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://distortedsoundmag.com/bowling-for-soup-announce-get-happy-tour-2018/ |title=Bowling For Soup announce 'Get Happy Tour 2018' |author=Weaver, James |date=September 25, 2017 |publisher=Distorted Sound}}</ref>

In celebration of the 20th anniversary of 1997's ''The Fury of The Aquabats!'', the band worked with veteran producer and engineer Cameron Webb on a complete [[remaster]] of the album which was independently released on vinyl and CD with bonus material on April 6, 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musictap.com/2018/03/26/20th-anniversary-remastered-and-expanded-reissue-of-classic-aquabats-album-the-fury-of-the-aquabats/ |title=20th Anniversary Remastered and Expanded Reissue Of Classic Aquabats Album, The Fury Of The Aquabats! |date=March 26, 2018 |publisher=Music Tap |author=Marowe}}</ref> The following day, The Aquabats played two sold-out shows at Los Angeles' [[The Fonda Theatre|Fonda Theater]] where they performed ''The Fury of The Aquabats!'' in its entirety, joined by former members Pollock, Terry and Deibert. Notably, Travis Barker appeared during the evening show to play three songs as his Baron von Tito persona, marking the first time Barker had performed with the band since 1998.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://x96.com/news/travis-barker-reunites-with-the-aquabats-for-one-night-only/ |title=Travis Barker Reunites With The AQUABATS for One Night Only! |publisher=[[X96]] |date=April 10, 2018 |author=Smith, Jon}}</ref> Three weeks later on April 28, this extended line-up performed as part of Barker and [[John Feldmann]]'s Back To The Beach ska festival in [[Huntington State Beach]], where Barker again joined the band for three songs.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.ocregister.com/2018/04/19/4-reasons-you-should-go-to-the-back-to-the-beach-festival/ |title=4 reasons you should go to the Back to the Beach Festival |newspaper=[[The Orange County Register]] |date=April 19, 2018 |author=Fadroski, Kelli Skye}}</ref>

===2019-present: ''The Aquabats! RadVentures!'' and ''Kooky Spooky...In Stereo''===
On July 31, 2018, after several weeks of teasing a major band announcement, The Aquabats launched a high-profile [[Kickstarter]] campaign with the goal of raising a minimum of $1.1 million to help finance an entire return season of ''The Aquabats! Super Show!'', as well as the production and release of three albums: a new studio album, a ''Super Show!'' soundtrack and a re-recorded greatest hits compilation.<ref name="BillboardKickstarter">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8467965/the-aquabats-kickstarter-campaign-video |title=The Aquabats Return With Kickstarter Campaign, Guest Star-Filled 'I Am the Aquabats' Video |author=Graff, Gary |date=July 31, 2018 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> The campaign video featured a slew of celebrity cameos voicing support for the band, though most prominently featured actor and musician [[Jack Black]], who was confirmed by ''Billboard'' to serve as executive producer for the series' return.<ref name="BillboardKickstarter" /> Along with the launch of the Kickstarter, The Aquabats began releasing a series of [[metafiction]]al ''Super Show!'' "mini-episodes" exclusively to their YouTube channel, depicting the MC Bat Commander's quest to reunite the estranged Aquabats following their show's cancellation. 

By August 28, mere days before the campaign's end date of September 1, the Kickstarter had only raised $601,629 of the band's desired $1.1 million goal. The funding was voluntarily cancelled and the campaign was significantly restructured, resurrected the same day with a new goal of $100,000 for a new album and continuing production of ''Super Show!'' "mini-episodes". The $100,000 mark was met within minutes and the project ultimately raised over $600,000, which was stated to be used to independently produce "at least twelve" mini-episodes of ''Super Show!'', two new Aquabats studio albums, one live album, and  two ''Super Show!'' soundtrack albums.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/theaquabats/bringbacktheaquabats |title=Bring Back THE AQUABATS!}}</ref>

Throughout 2019, The Aquabats worked resolutely to fulfill their Kickstarter-funded projects. In March, the band simultaneously released ''[[The Aquabats! Super Show! Television Soundtrack: Volume One]]'', a soundtrack compilation of songs from ''Super Show!''{{'}}s first season, and ''The Fury of The Aquabats! Live at The Fonda!'', a live recording of a 2018 performance of ''The Fury of The Aquabats!'', as exclusive digital downloads for Kickstarter backers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theaquabats.com/kickstarter/shipping |title=SHIPPING! The Aquabats! |publisher=www.theaquabats.com}}</ref> In June, preceded by the release of the single "Cobraman Theme!", ''The Aquabats! Super Show! Television Soundtrack: Volume One'' was given a wide physical release on The Aquabats' self-operated label Gloopy Records, premiering at 165 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and number one on Top Heatseekers, the band's highest placement on each chart to date.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://open.spotify.com/album/1NsN7Zs6TKTcKVWqfJ5Mkk |title=COBRAMAN THEME! |publisher=[[Spotify]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/The-Aquabats-Super-Show-Television-Soundtrack-Volume-One/master/1562671 |title=Super Show!

"Skeleton Inside!", the first single from The Aquabats' sixth studio album, premiered on the band's YouTube channel on October 25, 2019, though did not make mention of an album title or a tentative release date beyond "later this year".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n16T5Udik5M |title=Skeleton Inside! - The Aquabats! Lyrics Music Video! |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=October 25, 2019}}</ref> The album's official title, ''[[Kooky Spooky...In Stereo]]'', was revealed in February 2020, followed by the album's second single, the [[couch potato]]-themed "Pajamazon!", on April 10. Inspired by the ongoing [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States]], which necessitated mass self-[[quarantine|quarantining]] and [[social distancing]], "Pajamazon!" was promoted by a music video primarily made up of self-submitted videos of fans and friends of The Aquabats dancing to the song in their homes, marking The Aquabats' first music video since "Fashion Zombies!" in 2005. While ''Kooky Spooky...In Stereo'' was originally scheduled for a June 20 release date, manufacturing delays resulting from the coronavirus pandemic as well as political tensions from the ongoing [[George Floyd protests]] which began in late May 2020 prompted the band to postpone the album's release; in an uncharacteristically serious public statement, The Aquabats acknowledged that "There will always be time for goofy, rowdy rock...but it doesn't feel right to us to be loud and self-promoting at this moment in time", encouraging open discussion about race and racism and linking to resources from the [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] and confirming a new digital release date of August 21, 2020.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.readjunk.com/news/music/the-aquabats-releasing-new-album-kooky-spooky-in-stereo-on-june-20th/ |title=The Aquabats Releasing New Album "Kooky Spooky...In Stereo" on June 20th! |author=Kremkau, Bryan |date=April 10, 2020 |publisher=ReadJunk}}</ref>

Having originally formed as a part of Orange County's burgeoning [[third wave ska]] scene, much of the band's early material was rooted in the genre. Boasting an eight-piece line-up featuring two [[lead guitar]]ists, a [[keyboardist]] and a [[horn section]] consisting of two [[trumpet]]s and a [[saxophone]], The Aquabats' style of ska was primarily driven by brass and guitar, incorporating elements of [[surf rock]] and [[punk rock]].<ref name="Saturday Morning" /><ref name="eNotesBats" /> Their second album, 1997's ''[[The Fury of The Aquabats!]]'', while still predominantly ska-based, found the band starting to expand their sound into newer territory, featuring more pronounced punk and surf influences and [[Wikt:tongue-in-cheek|tongue-in-cheek]] experimentalism, including several [[instrumental]]s, pastiches of [[ragtime]] and [[tango music]] and the utilization of such unconventional instruments as [[clarinet]]s, [[electric sitar]]s and even [[Manualism (hand music)|manualism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-fury-of-the-aquabats-r317730/credits |title=The Fury of The Aquabats > Credits |publisher=[[allmusic]].com}}</ref><ref name="CrashMcLinterview" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drumlessons.com/drummers/travis-barker/ |title=Travis Barker biography |publisher=DrumLessons.com}}</ref>

In 1999, The Aquabats underwent a significant shift in style for their third studio album, ''[[The Aquabats vs. the Floating Eye of Death!]]'', and its companion piece ''[[Myths, Legends, and Other Amazing Adventures, Vol. 2]]'', further exploring the multi-genre eclecticism which had been hinted at with ''The Fury''. A conscious decision by the band to write more diverse material, these albums saw a near-complete forfeit of the brass-driven ska of their previous albums in favor of more guitar and [[synthesizer]]-structured songwriting, embracing a punk rock and new wave sound greatly influenced by [[Devo]] and [[Oingo Boingo]], two of The Aquabats' biggest inspirations.<ref name="Saturday Morning" /><ref name="CrashMcLinterview" /><ref name="NitroBio" /><ref name="PunkNewsBio">{{cite web |url=http://www.punknews.org/bands/theaquabats |title=The Aquabats! biography |publisher=Punknews.org}}</ref> The band also began widening their genre experimentation to encompass such disparate styles as [[electronica]], [[synthpop]] and even [[hip-hop]], elements which persist in their sound to present day.

During The Aquabats' career lull in the early 2000s, several of the band's key members departed from the line-up, eventually reducing the former octet down to a mere quintet of vocals, guitar, keyboards, bass, and drums.<ref name="AquabatsAllmusicBio" /> This inevitably had a profound impact on The Aquabats' sound, in particular the complete loss of their once characteristic horn section. 2005's ''[[Charge!!]]'', the first release featuring this reduced line-up, marked an abrupt shift from the eclecticism of their previous records, firmly establishing The Aquabats' current rock-based musical style, mixing elements of punk, new wave and ska, a style which has also been described as some publications as "[[geek rock|nerd rock]]" owing to the band's lyrical emphasis on pop culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/charge-r778331/review |title=Charge!!— The Aquabats > Review |publisher=[[allmusic.com]] |author=Loftus, Johnny}}</ref><ref name="NitroBio" /><ref name="Salgado">{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2014/03/the-greatest-nerd-rock-records-of-all-time/full-post/|title=The Greatest Nerd Rock Records of All Time|work=[[Consequence of Sound]]|first1=Nick|last1=Freed|first2=Christina|last2=Salgado|date=March 14, 2014|access-date=2015-03-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2008-12-11/music/the-aquabats/full/|title=The Aquabats|first=John|last=Linn|date=December 11, 2008|work=[[Phoenix New Times]]}}</ref>

In recent years, The Aquabats have introduced an increased presence of keyboards and synthesizers into this style, with critics noting their 2011 album ''[[Hi-Five Soup!]]'' as featuring more noticeable elements of synthpop and electronica.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.punknews.org/review/9926 |date=January 25, 2011 |publisher=Punknews.org |title=The Aquabats— Hi-Five Soup! review}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.altpress.com/reviews/entry/the_aquabats_-_hi-five_soup/ |date=January 18, 2011 |magazine=[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] |title=Reviews – The Aquabats— Hi-Five Soup!}}</ref>

===Departure from ska genre===
Although the band continues to incorporate occasional elements of ska into their music, The Aquabats have since distanced themselves from their association with the ska genre after having moved away from an overtly ska-based sound in the early 2000s, having since labeled themselves as simply a "rock band" in their official press biographies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/theaquabats |title=The Aquabats!

We were just The Aquabats. And some of the songs we happened to play were ska", noting elsewhere, "It was never a deliberate thing [to stop playing ska], but I think it just naturally happened because there's a lot of different styles of music that we play. I've always been into bands like [[Ween]] and things like that, that can chameleon-like drift from genre to genre and play whatever music they want...there's no boundaries. If you set yourself up as a punk band, then you pretty much just have to play punk. Or if you're a ska band, you just play ska".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvweb.com/news/exclusive-christian-jacobs-talks-the-aquabats-super-show-series-premiere-on-the-hub |title=Christian Jacobs Talks 'The Aquabats!

So as we grew as musicians, we wanted to experiment with different rhythms", adding "we were never really a good ska band anyway".<ref name="CrashMcLinterview" />

==Live performances==

Since the earliest days of the band, The Aquabats have earned a reputation for their theatrical live performances featuring a variety of comedic stunts and antics based around their superhero-themed persona.

During the 1990s, when their concerts were at their most elaborately staged, a typical Aquabats performance would often include choreographed [[stage combat|fight scene]]s with costumed villains, the use of numerous props, acrobatic stunts and varying degrees of [[pyrotechnics]], ranging from small [[firework]]s to The MC Bat Commander [[fire breathing]].<ref name="Saturday Morning" /><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/548664/Aquabats-and-Mealticket-to-return-for-Ska-Patricks-Day-fest-in-Provo.html?pg=all |title=Aquabats and Mealticket to return for Ska Patrick's Day fest in Provo |newspaper=[[Deseret News]] |date=March 14, 1997}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://joonbug.com/tag/aquabats |title=The Aquabats on joonbug.com |publisher=joonbug.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513011138/http://joonbug.com/tag/aquabats |archive-date=May 13, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/579947/The-Aquabats.html?pg=all |title=The Aquabats |newspaper=[[Deseret News]] |date=August 29, 1997}}</ref> While many of these elements were eventually phased out of the live shows in the early 2000s, the one consistent staple of every Aquabats concert has remained the band's onstage "battles" with villains and monsters.<ref name="MishMashConcertReview">{{cite web |url=http://www.mishmashmagazine.com/2007/music/live-reviews/the-aquabats-8-17-07/ |title=Live Reviews: The Aquabats— 8/17/07 |publisher=Mish Mash Magazine |date=August 19, 2007}}</ref> These villains, typically played by The Aquabats' [[road crew]], will crash the stage at one or two moments in the show and exchange humorous banter with the band before engaging each other in mock combat.<ref name="FilmJunkSA">{{cite web |url=http://www.filmjunk.com/2003/11/30/the-aquabats-serious-awesomeness-dvd/ |publisher=FilmJunk |title=The Aquabats – Serious Awesomeness (DVD) |date=November 30, 2003}}</ref> These fights have ranged from short, improvised fistfights to fully choreographed stage combat utilizing breakable props, maneuvers such as [[flying kick]]s and [[Flip (acrobatic)|back flips]], and sometimes spreading out into the audience, with The Aquabats ultimately winning most—but not all—encounters.<ref name="Justice" /><ref name="FilmJunkSA" /> For some performances, in place of a villain, The Aquabats will feature a sketch with one of their "allies": for example, to segue into their song "Magic Chicken", the titular character— a man in a [[chicken suit]]— will come onstage to hand out [[fried chicken]] to audience members.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/uponsun/2008/12/the_aquabats_at_marquee_theate.php |title=The Aquabats at Marquee Theater on Dec. 13 |website=[[Phoenix New Times]] |date=December 14, 2008}}</ref>
[[File:AquabatsFloatieRaces.jpg|thumb|left|250px|"Pool Floatie Races" is one of many ways The Aquabats incorporate audience participation into their shows.]]
[[Audience participation]] is a common element of The Aquabats' stage shows.

On the visual end of these performances, keeping in line with their cartoon and [[popular culture|pop culture]]-inspired aesthetic, The Aquabats' stage shows are accompanied by a large video screen backdrop which plays montage clips of various cartoons, movies, TV shows, and [[stock footage]] specifically edited to match each song.<ref name="NewTimesShowReview" /><ref name="TampaBayBats" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/rftmusic/2010/03/review_the_aquabats_mustard_plug_samuriot_firebird_st_louis_march_21_2010_photo_video.php |title=Review: The Aquabats, Mustard Plug and Samuriot at the Firebird, Sunday, March 21 |publisher=[[The Riverfront Times]] |date=March 22, 2010 |access-date=August 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513072838/http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/rftmusic/2010/03/review_the_aquabats_mustard_plug_samuriot_firebird_st_louis_march_21_2010_photo_video.php |archive-date=May 13, 2014 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> This screen also plays prerecorded comedy videos starring the band which introduce and close each show, as well as [[parody advertisement|fake commercials]] for fictional Aquabats-brand products which serve as impromptu "[[television advertisement|commercial breaks]]" between songs.<ref name="NewTimesShowReview" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.centralfloridafuture.com/2.10658/anti-pop-at-club-firestone-1.1419862 |title=Anti Pop at Club Firestone |date=November 20, 2008 |publisher=[[Central Florida Future]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513012658/http://www.centralfloridafuture.com/2.10658/anti-pop-at-club-firestone-1.1419862 |archive-date=May 13, 2014 }}</ref> These visuals, along with the band's props and costumes, are regularly changed to accommodate special seasonal performances, in particular The Aquabats' annual [[Christmas and holiday season|holiday]] shows.

==Superhero mythology==
[[File:TheAquabatsvillainfight.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The Aquabats fighting villains in [[San Francisco]] in 2012. Many of these onstage villains have been established in The Aquabats' fictional superhero mythology, with developed backstories of their own.]]
Perhaps even more so than for their music, The Aquabats are widely recognized for their eccentric [[superhero]] identity which adheres to a comprehensive [[mythology]] reflected in the band's music, stage shows and promotional material in which the members are in fact a team of musical crimefighters on a quest to save the world.

Detailed in their lyrics, [[liner notes]], website and [[The Aquabats! Super Show!|television series]], The Aquabats have developed a small but elaborate [[fictional universe]] surrounding this mythology, describing the band's fictitious history and outlandish adventures as well as conceiving an extensive roster of enemies and allies, many of whom are the subjects of specific songs and have appeared as part of The Aquabats' stage shows in mock [[Stage combat|fight scenes]] or comedic skits. Over the years, this mythology, and in particular the fictional backstory regarding their origins, has continually changed, evolved and occasionally been [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] to explain changes in the band's line-up.

The Aquabats' [[origin story]] can be separated into two distinct eras. For the first half of their career, the band maintained a consistently canonical backstory established over the course of their first two albums, alleging the band members were actually humanoid bat creatures hailing from a distant tropical island called Aquabania. According to legend, Aquabania had been invaded by the villainous Space Monster "M", forcing the surviving inhabitants to flee into the ocean where they eventually washed ashore in California and were taken in by Professor Monty Corndog, a [[mad scientist]] who used "chemicals" to give them [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]]. Donning costumes including such accessories as "radioactive [[rashguard]]s", "power belts", and "anti-negativity helmets", The Aquabats chose to channel their powers through music in order to "take over the world" by attracting legions of fans to aid them in combating Space Monster "M" and reclaiming their homeland, fighting the numerous villains and monsters who'd attempt to thwart their musical quest along the way.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theaquabats.com/aquatale.html |title=The History of The Aquabats |year=1998 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990202162007/http://www.theaquabats.com/aquatale.html |archive-date=February 2, 1999 |publisher=Theaquabats.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite av media |title=Liner notes for ''The Fury of The Aquabats!'' |year=1997}}</ref>

With the heavy line-up changes in the early-to-mid 2000s which left only two of the original members remaining, The Aquabats eventually dropped the Aquabania elements out of their backstory, reestablishing themselves as a group of freelance superheroes of indeterminate origin who travel the countryside, fighting evil and "destroying boredom".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theaquabats.com/bio |title=The Aquabats' fictional biography as of 2008 |publisher=www.theaquabats.com |year=2008 |access-date=April 18, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414011452/http://theaquabats.com/bio/ |archive-date=April 14, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This loose framework would later serve as the basis for the band's television series, ''[[The Aquabats! Super Show!]]'', where each member's character was further developed to showcase their own individual powers and personalities, transitioning the Aquabats' mythology from a [[story arc]] to a character ensemble.<ref name="GeeklyEntertainment">{{cite web |url=http://www.entertainmentgeekly.com/2012/03/28/christian-jacobs-talks-the-aquabats-super-show/ |title=The Geekly Interview: Christian Jacobs— The MC Bat Commander Himself— Talks 'The Aquabats! Super Show!' |publisher=Entertainment Geekly |date=March 28, 2012}}</ref> While the series' first season left the band's origins intentionally vague, several episodes of the second season feature each member of The Aquabats recounting the band's history in animated [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]] sequences; while one of these sequences recalls the original Aquabania mythos, each member's flashbacks directly contradict one another, leaving it unknown which could be considered officially canonical.

==Aquacadets and The Aquabats Cadet Faction==
[[File:The Aquabats at The Glass house.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Aquabats' dedicated fanbase and members of their official fan club are referred to as "Aquacadets".]]
Fans of The Aquabats are referred to by the band as '''Aquacadets''' or the more casual "Cadets", a title which has held alternately official and unofficial status among their fanbase for most of the band's career.

Throughout the late 1990s and into the mid-2000s, The Aquabats operated an official [[fan club]] known as The Aquabats Cadet Faction, selling membership packages which typically offered a variety of exclusive merchandise, access to exclusive web content, a subscription to an official [[newsletter]] written by members of the band and entrance into occasional semi-private "secret shows" held at smaller venues. Most significantly, enrollment into The Aquabats Cadet Faction granted card-carrying members admission into official [[fan convention]]s known as Cadet Summits, where fans could meet and interact with The Aquabats through Q&A panels, games and award shows where fans received trophies in categories including "Cadet of the Year". The Aquabats held five such Cadet Summits throughout Southern California from 1997 to 2006:

* October 25, 1997, [[Fountain Valley, California|Fountain Valley]]: The Aquabats hosted a day for fans at [[Boomers! Parks|Bullwinkle's Family Fun'N'Food]] [[family entertainment center]], which featured the premiere screening of the "[[Super Rad!]]" music video.
* December 5, 1998, [[Pomona, California|Pomona]]: the band performed an exclusive show at The Glass House concert venue alongside screenings of various videos including the only public showing of ''The Aquabats!'' 1998 television pilot.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mycitypaper.com/articles/112599/mus.aqua.shtml |date=December 5, 1998 |publisher=My City Paper |author=Rea, Hillary |title=Fear Not the Eye}}</ref>
* April 6, 2000, [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]]: advertised as "The Third Sorta-Annual 1999/2000 Aquacadet Summit", The Aquabats performed an extended awards show-themed concert at The Galaxy Theatre, featuring additional performances by side projects The Moon Monkeys, [[Digital Unicorn]] and Le Pigbat.
* January 18, 2002, [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]]: The Aquabats hosted a picnic gathering on the beach, highlighted by an acoustic singalong set made up entirely of fan requests. This performance was recorded and later released as an officially sanctioned [[The Aquabats discography#Bootlegs|bootleg cassette]] in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/The-Aquabats-Cadet-Beach-Party/release/5779393 |title=The Aquabats - Cadet Beach Party |publisher=[[Discogs]]}}</ref>
* June 6, 2006 in [[San Diego]]: hosted at the Concourse Meeting Hall during [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]] weekend, the band celebrated the 10th anniversary of ''The Return of The Aquabats'' by performing the album in its entirety with former member Prince Adam.

Following the 2006 Cadet Summit, The Aquabats Cadet Faction lapsed into an extended period of complete inactivity, upon which fans independently carried on unofficial fan club operations through [[social media]], most notably the formation of numerous splinter factions based around certain themes, shared interests or geographic location: while most of these groups were small sub-sections within online fan communities such as [[Tumblr]], some factions like "Piratebats" and "Ninjabats" cultivated a small real-world presence by attending The Aquabats' concerts in accordingly themed costume attire. In 2018, The Aquabats temporarily resurrected The Aquabats Cadet Faction as part of the ''Bring Back The Aquabats!'' Kickstarter campaign, again issuing personalized ID cards and exclusive merchandise and web content. As of 2020, however, Cadet Faction packages are no longer available, and there are no current plans for a future Cadet Summit.

In 2019, independent record label Related Records, who had previously released the officially sanctioned 2014 bootleg of The Aquabats' acoustic performance at the 2002 Cadet Summit, compiled and released ''No Singles: A 20 Year Anniversary Tribute to The Aquabats vs. The Floating Eye of Death'', a fourteen-track [[tribute album]] covering the entirety of the band's 1999 ''Floating Eye of Death'' album by various underground punk, [[electronica]] and [[experimental music|experimental]] musicians including The Emotron.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://relatedrecords.bandcamp.com/album/no-singles-a-20-year-anniversary-tribute-to-the-aquabats-vs-the-floating-eye-of-death |title=No Singles: A 20 Year Anniversary Tribute to The Aquabats vs. The Floating Eye of Death |publisher=[[Bandcamp]] |author=Related Records |date=December 24, 1999}}</ref>

After leaving The Aquabats in 1996, Ben Bergeson founded the instrumental [[surf rock]] band The Moon Monkeys, playing numerous shows with The Aquabats and GOGO13 before releasing their sole studio EP ''So Far, Far Out!'' in 1999 on Horchata Records.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moonmonkeys.com/Moon_Monkeys/Oh,_those_Moon_Monkeys_are_sooo_elusive....html |title=The Moon Monkeys |publisher=moonmonkeys.com}}</ref> Corey Pollock, following his own departure from The Aquabats in 2006, joined the Costa Mesa [[pop punk]] trio and longtime Aquabats tourmates [[Supernova (American band)|Supernova]] in August 2008, playing with them under his Aquabat stage name of "Chainsaw" until their hiatus in January 2010.

As professional musicians, current guitarist [[Ian Fowles]] and drummer [[Richard Falomir|Ricky Falomir]] have performed and recorded with many bands and musicians of note, though are best known as original members of the punk rock bands [[Death by Stereo]] and [[Assorted Jelly Beans]], respectively. In relation to The Aquabats, Fowles was a guest bassist for [[Hunter Burgan]]{{'}}s Hunter Revenge and – in costume as EagleBones – [[Kepi Ghoulie]]{{'}}s band during both groups' tours with The Aquabats, and in 2014, became an official member of [[My Chemical Romance]] singer [[Gerard Way]]{{'}}s solo band after the two had become acquainted working together on ''The Aquabats! Super Show!'', recording and co-writing on Way's 2014 debut ''[[Hesitant Alien]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archives.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/gerard-way-keeps-going-thanks-to-other-peoples-art/Content?oid=2908916 |title=Gerard Way keeps going thanks to other people's art |author=Lanham, Tom |newspaper=[[The San Francisco Examiner]] |date=October 12, 2014}}</ref> In June 2015, both Fowles and Falomir made up ex-[[Ramones]] bassist [[C.

The band's original instrumental version of "Sequence Erase!", recorded with [[Parry Gripp]], was used as the title theme for the band's original television pilot, ''The Aquabats! In Color!''. From 2004 to 2010, this recording was used as the theme song to the main series of ''[[Mega64]]'', a video game-themed comedy series produced by a comedy troupe of the same name. As longtime friends and associates of The Aquabats, the main cast and crew of ''Mega64'' would later go on to produce interstitial sketches for ''The Aquabats! Super Show!'' television series.
