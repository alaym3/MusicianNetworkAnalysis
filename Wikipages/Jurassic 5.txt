'''Jurassic 5''' is an American [[alternative hip hop]] group formed in 1993 by [[Rapping|rappers]] Charles Stewart ([[Chali 2na]]), Dante Givens (Akil), Courtenay Henderson ([[Soup (Jurassic 5)|Soup]] aka Zaakir), Marc Stuart (Marc 7); and [[disc jockey]]s Mark Potsic ([[DJ Nu-Mark]]) and Lucas Macfadden ([[Cut Chemist]]).<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/pop-jurassic-5s-monster-success-1159447.html "Pop: Jurassic 5's monster success"] by Tim Perry, ''The Independent'', May 16, 1998.</ref> 
The six piece crew that was formed, came out of the [[Los Angeles]] venue Good Life.<ref>[http://www.last.fm/music/Jurassic+5/+wiki] by Last.fm, "Jurassic 5", Retrieve April 7, 2012.</ref>
The group broke up in 2007,<ref name="timescolonist">[https://archive.today/20130204162940/http://www.timescolonist.com/entertainment/learning+swim+alone/3567124/story.html 2na learning to swim alone] by Mike Devlin, ''The Times-Colonist'', September 23, 2010</ref>
shortly after releasing their fourth LP ''Feedback'', citing "musical differences,"<ref>[https://archive.today/20120716021800/http://music.aol.com/artist/jurassic-5/biography] by John Bush: Rovi, "Jurassic 5 Biography", Retrieved April 7, 2012.</ref> but returned to the stage in 2013 and released a new track in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Minsker|first1=Evan|title=Jurassic 5 Sample the White Stripes on "The Way We Do It", Their First New Song in Eight Years|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/55274-jurassic-5-sample-the-white-stripes-on-the-way-we-do-it-their-first-new-song-in-eight-years/|website=Pitchfork Media|access-date=11 December 2014}}</ref> The members have continued to release music individually.

==History==
Jurassic 5 debuted nationally in 1995 from [[TVT Records]] with their first single, "Unified Rebelution". Jurassic 5 released their first record, ''[[Jurassic 5 EP]]'', in 1997. 
After Jurassic 5 put out their first record, it "cemented their position in the 1990s alternative hip hop movement, alongside artists such as Company Flow, Black Star and Kool Keith." {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} The group later signed to [[Interscope Records]] and the EP was repackaged with additional tracks and released in December 1998 as the full-length, eponymous debut album entitled ''[[Jurassic 5 (album)|Jurassic 5]]''.<ref name="timescolonist" /> In a 2002 interview with ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', the group explained the origin of their name. Chali 2na revealed, "I played the song to my friend’s mother and she made a joke: ‘You guys think you sound like the Fantastic Five, but you sound more like the Jurassic Five.’ And we started laughing but, well, the name stuck."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rapdirt.com/jurassic-5-explain-origin-of-their-name/599/|title=Jurassic 5 Explain Origin Of Their Name|access-date=11 March 2015}}</ref>

This was followed by their second album ''[[Quality Control (album)|Quality Control]]'', which peaked at #43 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name="billboard">[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=jurassic 5|chart=all}} Jurassic 5 Chart History], ''billboard.com'', Retrieved October 18, 2010.</ref>

In 2002, they released their third album, ''[[Power In Numbers]]'' which peaked at #15 on the Billboard 200 chart.

Jurassic 5 eventually toured without [[Cut Chemist]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pixelsurgeon.com/interviews/interview.php?id=241 |title=www.pixelsurgeon.com |access-date=11 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20060811172451/http://www.pixelsurgeon.com/interviews/interview.php?id=241 |archive-date=11 August 2006 }}</ref> who left the group to pursue a solo career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cutchemist.com/#/bio|title=Home - Cut Chemist|access-date=11 March 2015}}</ref> The remaining five members released their fourth and final album, ''[[Feedback (Jurassic 5 album)|Feedback]]'', on July 25, 2006. The album peaked at #15 on the Billboard 200.<ref name="billboard" />

The group split in 2007.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Jurassic 5 announce split|url=https://www.nme.com/news/nme/27208|magazine=NME|access-date=23 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712093108/http://www.nme.com/news/nme/27208|archive-date=12 July 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Reasons for the break-up were attributed to disagreements among members of the group.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Rapper Bitter About Jurassic 5 Split|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/rapper-bitter-about-jurassic-5-split_1025611|magazine=Contactmusic.com|access-date=23 August 2011}}</ref>

In 2013, the group re-formed, including the return of Cut Chemist, for the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] and an international tour, primarily in the UK but also including dates in Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Japan and the United States.<ref name="Billboard2013">{{cite news |title=Jurassic 5 Talks Reunion, Doc Plans Backstage At Coachella |first=Nicole |last=Pajer |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/1557420/jurassic-5-talks-reunion-doc-plans-backstage-at-coachella |work=Billboard.com |date=April 13, 2013 |access-date=October 27, 2013}}</ref><ref name="HipHopDX">{{cite news |title=Jurassic 5 Announces International Summer Tour Dates |first=Jake |last=Paine |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.23693/title.jurassic-5-announces-international-summer-tour-dates |work=Hip Hop DX |date=April 24, 2013 |access-date=27 October 2013}}</ref> They played at Glastonbury in 2014 and had a Word of Mouth Reunion Tour during the Summer of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/line-up-poster/ |title=2014 - Glastonbury Festival |author=Pretty Good Digital |access-date=11 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417014545/http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/line-up-poster |archive-date=17 April 2010 }}</ref>
