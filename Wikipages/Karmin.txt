'''Karmin''' was an American [[Pop music|pop]] duo consisting of [[Qveen Herby|Amy Renee Noonan]] and Nick Noonan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/entertainment/t/blogEntry?id=16300239|title=Karmin: 7 Things You Don't Know About the Pop Duo - ABC News|work=go.com|access-date=March 30, 2015}}</ref> Starting as a novelty act that released covers on YouTube, they signed in 2011 with [[Epic Records]]. In May 2012, Karmin released their debut EP ''[[Hello (Karmin EP)|Hello]]'', which spawned the singles [[Brokenhearted (Karmin song)|"Brokenhearted"]] and [[Hello (Karmin song)|"Hello"]], and received mixed reviews.  ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named Karmin's lead singer Amy as the winner of "Women Who Rock" 2012 contests.<ref>{{cite news | title =Karmin Interview with Rolling Stone | newspaper =Rolling Stone | url =https://www.rollingstone.com/womenwhorock#video-popup | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20120620204419/http://www.rollingstone.com/womenwhorock#video-popup | url-status =dead | archive-date =June 20, 2012 | access-date =April 2, 2014 }}</ref> In March 2014, the duo released their debut album, ''[[Pulses (Karmin album)|Pulses]]''. The album's lead single, [[Acapella (Karmin song)|"Acapella"]], charted in the top 10 in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], and went Gold in the [[United States]]. They left Epic Records in the middle of 2014 and have since released music independently. Their second album ''[[Leo Rising]]'' was released on September 9, 2016.<ref name="billboard.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6509542/karmin-along-the-road-video-exclusive-interview |title=Exclusive Video Premiere: Karmin Go DIY Video Route for New Single 'Along The Road' |website=Billboard.com |date=March 24, 2015 |access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref>

In 2017, the duo disbanded Karmin to focus on [[Qveen Herby]], Amy Noonan's alter ego. The project moves away from pop in favor of more of an R&B and hip-hop/rap sound.

==Life and career==
===Early life and career beginnings===
Amy Heidemann and Nick Noonan met while attending [[Berklee College of Music]] in [[Boston]], from which they graduated in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berklee.edu/news/4133/the-mastermind-behind-karmin|title=The Mastermind Behind Karmin|first=Darry|last=Madden|publisher=Berklee College of Music|date=February 6, 2012}}</ref> Heidemann is a graduate of Seward High School in [[Nebraska]]. Noonan graduated from Old Town High School in [[Maine]], where he was a member of the concert band and jazz ensemble. The duo has also been a couple since September 2005 and in March 2016 confirmed that they had married.

===2014–2016: Split from Epic Records and ''Leo Rising''===
In 2014, after the release of their debut album ''[[Pulses (Karmin album)|Pulses]]'' and the attendant tour, Karmin left Epic Records. In an interview with Billboard, Heidemann said: "We were hungry to try a more musically honest approach. We wanted to be a little bit nerdier than we think they had hoped".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6509542/karmin-along-the-road-video-exclusive-interview|title=Exclusive Video Premiere: Karmin Go DIY Video Route for New Single 'Along The Road'}}</ref> Six months after the release of ''Pulses'', in September 2014, Karmin released a single with rapper [[George Watsky]] titled "No Flex Zone (Remix)", inspired by the song "No Flex Zone" by Rae Sremmurd. It was produced by Nick Noonan.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Later that year, Karmin began work on their second album, ''[[Leo Rising]]''.<ref name="billboard.com"/> Two digital singles were released in 2014: "Sugar" on October 8, followed by "Yesterday" on October 24, 2014. Another single "[[Along The Road (song)|Along the Road]]" was released on March 25, 2015 and was slated to be the lead single off the project, was later relegated as a promotional release.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In 2016, Wild Culture released the ''Sugar'' EP in collaboration with Karmin. It features three remixes of "Sugar" and a remix of Riley Pearce's single "Brave".{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The album ''[[Leo Rising]]'' was released on September 9, 2016.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===2017–present: Qveen Herby===
At the beginning of 2017, Amy Noonan revealed in a livestream that a Leo Rising tour would not be held in 2017, and if there was one it would be in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/KarminLately/status/816728463918989312|title=Qveen Herby Lately on Twitter|website=twitter.com|access-date=April 9, 2018}}</ref> She also revealed that alongside the launch of a new website, new music was in the works.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/KarminLately/status/816728195106033664|title=Qveen Herby Lately on Twitter|website=twitter.com|access-date=April 9, 2018}}</ref>

In 2017, all of Karmin's social media was rebranded to [[Qveen Herby]] and a small preview stating "Karmin Is Dead, Long Live the Queen" was posted. Noonan soon formally announced her solo career and launched the website Qveenherby.com.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qveenherby.com/|title=qveenherby|website=qveenherby|access-date=April 9, 2018}}</ref> The music video for Qveen Herby's first single "Busta Rhymes" was released on June 1, 2017, followed by the release of ''EP 1'' a day later.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} The EP received positive reviews from critics, who praised Herby's rebranding as an artist and the exploration of [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[hip hop music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://salutemag.com/review-qveen-herby-plays-no-games-ep1/|title=Review: Qveen Herby Plays No Games on EP1 -Salute Magazine|website=salutemag.com|language=en-US|access-date=October 29, 2017}}</ref> The EP also experienced fair success, peaking at number 37 on the US ''Billboard'' Independent Albums Chart and 13 on the US Heatseekers Albums chart.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}
