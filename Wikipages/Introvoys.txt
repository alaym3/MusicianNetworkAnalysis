==History==

===Formation and early years: 1986-1988===
INTRoVOYS was formed in Manila, Philippines  in 1986 by 3rd-G Cristobal, [[Paco Arespacochaga]], Jonathan Buencamino. 3rd-G and Paco were classmates in high school, but have known each other since elementary. The first incarnation of INTRoVOYS had Jonathan Buencamino, Paco Arespacochaga and 3rd-G Cristobal in a small rehearsal space on the corner of Katipunan and Santolan in Quezon City, Philippines. During their first rehearsal, 3rd-G taught Paco how to play the drums. Later, they added Jonathan Buencamino's younger brother Jj to play keyboards, Ira Cruz, lead guitars, and Jobert Buencamino for bass guitar.  They recorded the song ''Just a Dream'' which was released in  the ''10 of Another Kind'' compilation album in 1989.

===''Back to the Roots'': 1989-1991===
Due to other priorities, 3rd-G had to give up his position as the band’s rhythm guitar player. The band released their debut album, ''Back to the Roots'' in 1990. Their first two singles received a lukewarm response and the band's label, Dyna Records, was ready to drop them. In spite of this, their third single ''However Which Way'', went to No. 1 in Metro Manila in just two weeks. It became the No. 1 song in the country after a month, paving the way for a national tour. Culled from the same album are certified No. 1 singles such as, ''Calling All Nations'', ''Maynila'' and ''Lullabye'' among many others.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}. Ira Cruz left the band in 1991.

===''Breaking New Grounds'' and ''Line To Heaven'': 1991-1994===
When Cruz left INTRoVOYS, Vic Carpio replaced him as their new guitarist. The band's second album, ''Breaking New Grounds'', was released in 1992. Included in this album were the hits ''Will I Survive'', ''Di Na Ako Aasa Pa'', ''Stay'' and ''Are You Happy''. The album achieved [[Music recording sales certification|quadruple platinum]] status, earning INTRoVOYS the tag "The No. 1 Band in the Land".{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}. In 1993, the band released their third album, ''Line to Heaven'', wherein the carrier single was written after Arespacochaga suffered the tragic loss of his parents.  This album also included another hit song, "Kailanman".

===''Greatest Hits...Live'', ''One'' and ''Eroplano'': 1994-1999===
Jobert Buencamino left the band in 1994 for health and personal reasons. The band invited Paku Herrera of [[Neocolours]] to take on Jobert’s chores. They released their first greatest hits concert ''Greatest Hits...Live'' followed by their carrier single ''Living My Life'' in 1995. The band's fourth album ''One'' released in 1996, included hits ''Tell Me Why'', ''More Than A Friend'' and ''Magkaisa Tayong Lahat''. This was Arespacochaga's last album and he left the band in 1996 and was replaced by Toto Villanueva as the new drummer. They released their fifth album ''Eroplano'' features the hits "Fool", "My Child", "Eroplano", "The Big Ride" and a cover of Mr. [[Rey Valera]]'s hit ''Kung Kailangan Mo Ako''. A year later, Jonathan Buencamino was forced to leave due to an illness that caused him to lose his voice indefinitely.

===Short-Lived Reunion and Hiatus: 2000-2004===
In 2000, Paco Arespacochaga went solo and released his album called ''Rebirth'',  featuring three popular songs of his former band and a collaboration with his former wife [[Geneva Cruz]]. Paco Arespacochaga rejoined the band in 2000. [[Ira Cruz]], who had played with INTRoVOYS from 1988 to 1991, rejoined with the original line-up members.  Paco, Jonathan, Jj & Jobert Buencamino and Vic Carpio for the short-lived reunion run in 2001 and after that, he decided to pursue other interests. He joined Passage and Co-founded the Band [[Kapatid (band)|Kapatid]]. Vic Carpio and Jobert Buencamino decided to retire and pursue other interests and the other members decided to go on an indefinite hiatus.

===''A Brighter Day'' and ''New Beginnings'': 2005-2013===
After years of hiatus, Arespacochaga, Jonathan & Jj Buencamino decided to get back together and work on a new album with their two new members, Henry Abesamis on bass guitar and Jonathan Manuel on guitars. In 2005, they released the album entitled ''A Brighter Day'', marks a beginning of a new chapter for the band. The landmark album, released 7 years after their last album, ''Eroplano'', marks the exodus of the band from the Philippines to the United States. 

In December 2006, the band released their first studio Greatest Hits album entitled, ''New Beginnings'', a collection of re-arranged 18 major hits and introduced two new members, Steve Guadiz on guitar and Chot Ulep on bass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://talk.philmusic.com/index.php?topic=78554.25|title=Where did the Introvoys & After image go?|website=talk.philmusic.com}}</ref>

In October 2011, at the ''Tanduay Rockfest'', Arespachochaga performed signature INTRoVOYS hits including ''Line To Heaven'' and ''Di Na Ako Aasa Pa''. Buoyed by the warm welcome he got from the crowd, he stated, ''"Salamat. Maraming, maraming salamat. By next year, kasama ko na ang buong banda"'' ("Thank you. Thank you very much. By next year, the rest of the band will be with me."){{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} In June 2012, Jonathan Dela Paz became the new bassist for the band. In May 2013, Jj Buencamino decided to retire and Art Pangilinan became their new keyboardist.
