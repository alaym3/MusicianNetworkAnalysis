'''2AM''' ({{lang-ko|투에이엠}}) is a South Korean boy group, that consists of [[Jo Kwon]], [[Lee Chang-min (singer)|Lee Chang-min]], [[Lim Seul-ong]] and [[Jeong Jinwoon]]. The band was formed by [[JYP Entertainment]] through the Mnet documentary ''Hot Blood'', which spawned the eleven-member boy band [[One Day (South Korean band)|One Day]]; 2AM primarily perform ballad songs while their brother group [[2PM]] performed more dance-focused music. With the addition of Changmin from [[Big Hit Music|Big Hit Entertainment]], the group was co-managed by JYP and Big Hit from 2008 to 2014. They officially debuted on July 11, 2008,<ref name="2AM info">{{cite web|date=2010-05-18|title=2AM vs 2PM..맞대결의 끝이 안보인다|url=https://star.mt.co.kr/stview.php?no=2010051813395494608&type=1&outlink=1|access-date=January 12, 2013|website=Star News|language=ko}}</ref> on [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS']] ''[[Music Bank (TV show)|Music Bank]]'', performing their debut single "This Song". The group also debuted in Japan with the single "[[Never Let You Go: Shindemo Hanasanai]]" in January 2012.

2AM's albums and singles were commercially successful. Several of their Korean albums have charted within the top ten in the [[Gaon Album Chart]], with their album ''[[Can't Let You Go Even If I Die|I Was Wrong]]'' (2010) marking their first number one album. Several of their singles have achieved high peaks at the [[Gaon Digital Chart]], with "[[Can't Let You Go Even If I Die]]," "You Wouldn't Answer My Calls," and "I Wonder If You Hurt Like Me" topping the chart. Their Japanese singles have also peaked within the top ten of the [[Oricon Singles Chart]].  

After the group departed JYP and Big Hit, 2AM was put on hiatus as the members moved to different companies and labels and pursued solo careers. Their hiatus extended as most of the group took part in their [[Conscription in South Korea|mandatory military service]]. Following the end of their military service, the group reunited after seven years with their fourth extended play, ''[[Ballad 21 F/W]]'' (2021).
