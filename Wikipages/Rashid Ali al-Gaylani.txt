'''Rashid Ali al-Gaylani'''<ref group="note">in Arab standard pronunciation '''Rashid Aali al-Kaylani'''; also transliterated as '''Sayyad Rashid Aali al-Gillani''', '''Sayyad Rashid Ali al-Gailani''' or sometimes '''Sayyad Rashid Ali el Keilany''' ("[[Sayyid|Sayyad]]" serves to address higher standing male persons)</ref> ({{lang-ar|رشيد عالي الکَيلاني}}, {{IPA-ar|raʃiːd ʕaːliː al.keːlaːniː}})&nbsp;(1892 – 28 August 1965) was an Iraqi politician who served as [[List of Prime Ministers of Iraq|Prime Minister]] of the [[Kingdom of Iraq]] on three occasions: from March to November 1933, from March 1940 to February 1941 and from April to May 1941. He is chiefly remembered as an ardent [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]] who attempted to remove the [[United Kingdom|British]] influence from [[Iraq]] by starting a coup against the government in 1941. During his brief tenures as Prime Minister in 1940 and 1941, he attempted to negotiate settlements with the [[Axis powers]] during [[World War II]] in order to counter British influence in Iraq.

==Early life==
Rashid Ali was the son of Sayyid Abdul Wahhab al-Gaylani and born into the prominent [[Baghdad]]-based Gaylani family. He also had origins in the Circassian governors of the Ottoman Vilayet. Members of the Gaylani family were known as [[Sayyid|''sayed'']], as the family’s ancestry can be traced back to the [[Islam]]ic prophet [[Muhammad]].<ref>Makiya, p. 216</ref> Rashid Ali enrolled in law school in Baghdad and was a lawyer until his political career.<ref>Cleveland, p. 212</ref>

==Political career==
In 1924, Rashid Ali al-Gaylani began his career in politics in the first government led by [[List of Prime Ministers of Iraq|Prime Minister]] [[Yasin al-Hashimi]]. Yasin al-Hashimi appointed Gaylani as the Minister of Justice. The two men were ardent [[Arab nationalism|nationalists]] and were opposed to any [[United Kingdom|British]] involvement in the internal politics of Iraq. They rejected the [[Anglo-Iraqi Treaty (1930)|Anglo-Iraqi Treaty]] signed by the government of Prime Minister [[Nuri as-Said]] in 1930. They formed the [[Party of National Brotherhood]] to promote nationalist aims. Gaylani served as Prime Minister for the first time in 1933 but held office for less than eight months. In 1938 he was seized and exiled to 'Ana for his suspected role in the Baghdad bomb-throwing of November and the general political upheaval.<ref>Longrigg, 1953, p. 274</ref>

He was elected as the [[Chamber of Deputies of Iraq|president of the Chamber of Deputies]] in 1925 and 1926.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xLnbFLjcX4sC&q=%22President+of+the+Chamber+of+Deputies%22+iraq&pg=PA93|title=Britain in Iraq: Contriving King and Country, 1914-1932|first=Peter|last=Sluglett|date=December 28, 2007|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231142014|via=Google Books}}</ref>

During the Hashimi government, Gaylani served as Minister of Interior with the additional benefit of the lucrative trusteeship of the Qadiri Awqaf. Later, as prime minister, he would retain the interior portfolio as public works projects progressed, including the laying of the foundations for a mosque to be named the Faysal Mosque.<ref>Longrigg, 1953,  pp. 248, 283</ref>

On 31 March 1940, when Gaylani was again appointed Prime Minister, [[World War II]] had started and Iraq had just experienced the premature death of King [[Ghazi of Iraq|Ghazi]]. Ghazi's reign was followed by a [[Regent|Regency]] for his four-year-old son who was now the new King [[Faisal II of Iraq|Faisal II]]. Faisal's Regent was Ghazi's uncle, [[Emir]] [[Abdul Illah, Regent of Iraq|Abdul-Illah]]. Abdul-Illah supported Britain in the war, but he was unable to control Gaylani, who used the war to further his own nationalist goals by refusing to allow Allied troops passage through Iraq to the front. He also rejected calls for Iraq to break its ties with [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Fascist Italy]] and sent his Justice Minister, [[Naji Shawkat]], to Ankara to meet with Germany's ambassador to [[Turkey]], [[Franz von Papen]], to win German support for his government. German Foreign Ministry archives record that Shawkat met von Papen on July 5, 1940, and he carried a letter of introduction from [[Mohammad Amin al-Husayni]], the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, expressing a desire for a treaty of friendship and collaboration.<ref>Aboul-Enein and Aboul-Enein, 2013, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4WRVAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA51 51]-52</ref> Baghdad was the early base for Nazi Middle East intelligence operations during World War II.<ref>Lewis, 2003, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=fFZ0LuFIa0QC&pg=PA69   69]-70</ref>

===1941 Iraqi coup d'état===

Britain responded with severe economic sanctions against Iraq. Meanwhile, news of [[Operation Compass|British victories against Italian forces in North Africa]] weakened support for Gaylani. On 31 January 1941, under pressure from Regent Abdul-Illah, he resigned as Prime Minister. This only exacerbated his mistrust of Britain and its supporters in the government. Together with the members of the [[Golden Square (Iraq)|Golden Square]], Gaylani made plans to assassinate Regent Abdul-Illah and seize power. On 31 March, Abdul-Illah discovered the plot to assassinate him and fled the country.

[[1941 Iraqi coup d'état|On April 1, the Golden Square executed their coup d'état]]; on April 3, the "National Defence Government" replaced the government of the Regent with Gaylani as Prime Minister. As one of his first acts, Gaylani sent an Iraqi [[artillery]] force to confront [[RAF Habbaniya|the RAF base in Habbaniya]]. By the end of April, Iraqi forces held in strong positions on the escarpment above the base, and a siege began.

Iraq had been a major supplier of [[petroleum]] to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort and represented an important landbridge between British forces in [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]] and [[British Raj|India]]. To secure Iraq, [[Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] ordered General [[Archibald Wavell]] to protect the air base at Habbaniya. On 18 April, British forces from India landed in [[Basra]], ''[[Iraqforce|Sabine Force]]''. In the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], another force was created to enter Iraq from the west and relieve RAF Habbaniya, ''[[Habforce|Habbaniya Force]]''.

===Anglo-Iraqi War===
{{main|Anglo-Iraqi War}}
At Habbaniya, the besieging Iraqis demanded the cessation of all training activities and of all flights in and out of the base. On 2 May, the commander at RAF Habbaniya, [[Air Vice-Marshal]] [[Harry George Smart]], responded to the Iraqi demands by launching a pre-emptive strike against the Iraqi forces overlooking the air base. This action initiated the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]]. Within a week, the Iraqis abandoned the escarpment. By mid-May, British forces consisting mainly of Assyrian levies from Habbaniya had moved on to [[Fallujah]] and, after overcoming Iraqi resistance there, moved on to Baghdad. On 29 May, as British troops were closing in on his position, Gaylani fled to [[Iran]]. Before he left Baghdad, Gaylani contacted [[Mulla Effendi]] and informed him that he had chosen his house as a safe haven for the royal family to stay until the conflict ended.{{fact|date=June 2021}}

On 31 May, an [[armistice]] between the British and the Iraqis was signed. On 1 June, the Regent returned to Baghdad and his government was restored. Immediately afterwards, the Farhud, a violent [[Farhud|pogrom against Jews]], took place in [[Baghdad]].

===Iran, Italy, Germany and Saudi Arabia===

Gaylani was not to stay long in Iran. [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|On 25 August 1941, British and Soviet forces invaded Iran]] and removed [[Reza Shah]] from power. Gaylani then fled to Italy.<ref>"Preachers of Hate: Islam and the War on America" p. 106</ref> Later he was received by German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] in Berlin, and he was recognized as the leader of the Iraqi [[government in exile]]. Upon the [[End of World War II in Europe|defeat of Germany]], Gaylani again fled and found refuge, this time in [[Saudi Arabia]].

==Later life and death==
Gaylani did not return from exile until after the revolution that overthrew the Iraqi monarchy, in 1958. Once again, he attempted to seize power; he plotted a revolt against [[Abdul Karim Kassem|Abdul Karim Qasim]]'s government. The revolt was foiled and Gaylani was sentenced to death, but later pardoned, allowing him to live in Lebanon until 1965 when he died at the age of 72.
