==Early life==
The youngest of four children, Modugno was born at [[Polignano a Mare]], in the [[province of Bari]] ([[Apulia]]), on 9 January 1928.<ref name=Parents/> His father, Vito Cosimo Modugno,<ref name=Birth>{{Cite web | url = http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2002/01/09/polignano-mister-volare-storia-di-un.html | work = [[la Repubblica]] | language = it | access-date = 11 June 2012 | title = Polignano & Mister Volare storia di un amore impossibile | date = 9 January 2002 | author = Raffaele Lorusso}}</ref> was a [[Municipal police (Italy)|municipal police]] commander,<ref name=Parents>{{Cite web |url=http://www.okmusik.com/it/artisti/domenico-modugno_2222 |publisher=OkMusic.com |language=it |access-date=11 June 2012 |title=Artisti – Domenico Modugno |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68LegzPQg?url=http://www.okmusik.com/it/artisti/domenico-modugno_2222 |archive-date=11 June 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> while his mother, Pasqua Lorusso,<ref name=Birth/> was a housewife.<ref name=Parents/>

At the age of 9, his family moved to [[San Pietro Vernotico]], in the [[Province of Brindisi]],<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1995/agosto/07/Controfesta_per_Modugno_nel_paese_co_0_9508077179.shtml | work = [[Corriere della Sera]] | language = it | date = 7 August 1995 | access-date = 11 June 2012 | title = Controfesta per Modugno nel paese che lo adottò | author = Alberto Selvaggi}}</ref> where his father was transferred for a new job position.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2002/01/10/era-orgoglioso-delle-sue-radici.html | work = [[la Repubblica]] | language = it | access-date = 11 June 2012 | title = Era orgoglioso delle sue radici | author = Antonella Gaeta | date = 10 January 2002}}</ref> Here Domenico attended primary school and learned San Pietro Vernotico's dialect, which belongs to the linguistic area of [[Lecce]]'s language, similar to Sicilian. He attended secondary school in Lecce.<ref name=bio/>

==Career==
While still studying, he had a role in a cinematographic version of ''[[Filumena Marturano]]'' by [[Eduardo De Filippo]] as well as some other films.<ref name=bio/> In 1957, his song "[[Lazzarella]]", sung by [[Aurelio Fierro]], came second in the [[Festival della Canzone Napoletana]], bringing him his first taste of popularity.<ref name=bio/> 
[[File:Partitissima modugno67.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Modugno in 1967]]
In 1958, Modugno took part in Antonio Aniante's comedy ''La Rosa di Zolfo'' at the Festival della Prosa in [[Venice]]. Also in 1958, he discovered the Italian [[comedy duo]] of [[Franco Franchi]] and [[Ciccio Ingrassia]], became their manager and got them into a long running film career.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vivarelli |first=Nick |url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117925454/ |title=Variety Reviews – How We Got the Italian Cinema into Trouble: Franco & Ciccio's Real Story – Film Reviews – Venice – Review by Nick Vivarelli |publisher=Variety.com |date=2 November 2004 |access-date=10 April 2012}}</ref> The turning point of his career came in that year, when he also participated in the [[Sanremo Music Festival]], presenting, together with [[Johnny Dorelli]], the song "[[Volare (song)|Nel blu dipinto di blu]]." Co-authored by Modugno and [[Franco Migliacci]], the song won the contest and became an enormous success worldwide.  It received two [[Grammy Award]]s<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book

Modugno reportedly used the money gained with "Nel blu dipinto di blu" to purchase a [[Ferrari]], however, his car was totaled in an accident, which included his fenders being smashed. This was mentioned in the [[Allan Sherman]] song "America's a nice Italian Name."

In 1959, Modugno won the Sanremo Music Festival for the second time in a row, with "[[Piove (Ciao, ciao bambina)|Piove]]" (also known as "Ciao, ciao bambina"), and received second place in 1960 with "Libero." This was a successful period of time for Modugno who again represented Italy in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1959|Eurovision Song Contest of 1959]]. Later his hit song "Io" was sung by [[Elvis Presley]] in English with the title "Ask Me."<ref name=bio/>

In 1962, Modugno won the Sanremo Music Festival a third time with "Addio..., addio...."  Four years later, he again represented Italy at [[Eurovision Song Contest 1966|Eurovision]] with "[[Dio, come ti amo]]." [[Sergio Franchi]] recorded it in Italian (titled "Oh How Much I Love You (Dio, come ti amo!)) on his 1967 RCA Victor album, ''From Sergio-with Love.'' [[Jack Jones (singer)|Jack Jones]] recorded it in English for his 1967 album, ''Our Song,'' under the title "Oh How Much I Love You."<ref name=bio/>

Modugno was an actor in 44 movies (such as ''[[Appuntamento a Ischia]]''), and was a film producer of two (''Tutto è musica'' of 1963 was his own biographical production).<ref name=bio/>

In the 1970, Modugno focused on more classic music genres and profiles, as a singer and as a musician, adapting poetry, acting on television and in lead singing roles of modern operas.<ref name=bio/>

==Final years==
In 1984, Modugno suffered a severe stroke and remained partially paralyzed; this forced him to abandon his artistic career and devote himself to rehab.<ref name=bio/>

From 1986, he worked for the rights of disabled people, and in June 1987, he was elected congressman for [[Turin]] in Italian Parliament, in the ranks of the [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radical Party]], a liberal-social political group.<ref name=bio/> In the past he had supported the campaigns of the [[Italian Socialist Party]] and one for divorce, in addition to criticizing the human rights' violation by the regime of [[Augusto Pinochet]], that cost him a denial of entry in [[Chile under Pinochet|Chile]], where he had been scheduled to hold a concert.<ref name=bio/> In this last stage of his life, instead, he was very active in social issues, fighting against inhuman conditions of patients in the [[Agrigento]] [[psychiatric hospital]].<ref name=bio/>

Modugno returned on the music scene, definitively (he already held a concert for former inmates of Agrigento's mental asylum, in 1989), in 1992–1993. His last song was ''Delfini'' (''Dolphins''), in 1993 with his son, [[Massimo Modugno|Massimo]].<ref name=bio/>

On 6 August 1994, Modugno died at the age of 66, from a heart attack, on the island of [[Lampedusa]], south of Sicily, while he was in his home by the sea.<ref name=bio/> His beach-villa was put up for sale in 2020. It is located on Rabbits' Islet beach, the location is part of a natural protected reserve with limestones and crags.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tgcom24.mediaset.it/spettacolo/lampedusa-in-vendita-la-villa-appartenuta-a-domenico-modugno_23366393-202002a.shtml|access-date=6 October 2020|website=www.tgcom24.mediaset.it|title=Lampedusa, in vendita la villa appartenuta a Domenico Modugno}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|author=Silvia Marchetti|title=A hit song writer's former villa on one of the world's best beaches is up for sale|url=https://www.cnn.com/style/article/volare-domenico-modugno-villa-for-sale-lampedusa/index.html|access-date=6 October 2020|website=CNN|language=en}}</ref>
