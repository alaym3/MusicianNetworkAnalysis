From 2005, Schumann and McDonald performed together as part of [[John Schumann and the Vagabond Crew]].

==History==
Redgum was formed in 1975 when three students at [[Flinders University]], [[John Schumann]], [[Michael Atkinson (musician)|Michael Atkinson]] and Verity Truman collaborated for a musical assessment piece for their Politics and Art course.<ref name="McF"/> The trio quickly gained fame around the University community for their forthright songs, and by 1976 had been joined by violinist Chris Timms who had previously attended Flinders University.<ref name="McF"/> The group were soon in demand for parties, pubs and rallies throughout [[South Australia]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. On the first album, ''[[If You Don't Fight You Lose]]'' (1978) Redgum showed it was one of the few Australian bands prepared to tackle domestic politics and culture. "One More Boring Night in Adelaide" for some will remain, despite some of its dated references, a classic analysis of Australian provincial [[parochialism]]. Initially a part-time band, performing weekends and school holidays (two members were teachers), it was only after they released their second album, ''[[Virgin Ground]]'' (late 1980), to strong sales and critical acclaim, that the group became full-time and started touring nationally.<ref name="McF"/>

The group's success continued to grow with the release of their next three albums, ''[[Virgin Ground]]'', ''[[Brown Rice and Kerosine]]'' (1981) and the EP ''[[Cut to the Quick]]'' (September 1982), and they weathered several line-up changes including the addition of a [[didgeridoo]] and the replacement of Timms in May 1982 with [[Hugh McDonald (Australian musician)|Hugh McDonald]], among others. They released a [[Song book|songbook]] ''The Redgum Songbook: Stubborn Words, Flagrant Vices'' (1981).

[[File:CaughtInTheAct.jpg|thumb|1983's ''Caught in the Act.'']]

Collaboration with influential Australian folk producer [[Trevor Lucas]] (from UK folk group [[Fairport Convention]]) brought the high-point of their career – the live LP ''[[Caught in the Act (Redgum album)|Caught in the Act]]'' was released in May 1983 and "[[I Was Only 19]]" aka "A Walk in the Light Green" (March 1983) hit number one on the Australian singles chart. The song precipitated a [[Royal Commission]] into the use and effects of chemical agents in the [[Vietnam War]] by the Australian military. The album included "The Diamantina Drover" and "The Last Frontier" which are indicative of their folk music style.

The band released their next LP, ''[[Frontline (Redgum album)|Frontline]]'' (June 1984) with its single "I've Been to Bali Too", and started touring folk venues in the UK and Europe with some success. Late in 1985, Schumann announced that he had signed a solo deal with [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] and would be quitting. Redgum released one more album of new material, ''[[Midnight Sun (Redgum album)|Midnight Sun]]'' (1986), and a last single "Roll it on Robbie" (1987) after which Atkinson left. There were plans to release another album<ref>That Striped Sunlight Sound blog [http://stripedsunlight.blogspot.com/2008/06/redgum-lost-album.html Redgum: The lost album]</ref> but this did not occur. The album was recorded at Warrenwood in Melbourne but never released due to the studio going into liquidation. The remaining members who recorded this album Hugh McDonald, Verity Truman, Michael Spicer, James Spicer and Tim Hannaford performed until 1990, when the band's considerable debts were cleared. After this was achieved Redgum disbanded.<ref name="ARDb"/>

==Band members post-Redgum==
After leaving the band, Schumann released two solo albums before pursuing a brief political career as an independent, standing for the South Australian seat of [[Division of Mayo|Mayo]] in the 1998 Federal election and losing by a small margin. He was later employed by the Democrats as a staffer. He left the Democrats in 2000 and returned to further solo works. Schumann returned to recording in 2005 with the [[John Schumann and the Vagabond Crew|Vagabond Crew]] (which includes fellow Redgum member [[Hugh McDonald (Australian musician)|Hugh McDonald]]) and new albums were released in 2005 and [[Behind the Lines (John Schumann album)|2008]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.schumann.com.au/john/news.html |title=John Schumann Official website Latest News |access-date=3 November 2007 }}</ref>

Chris Timms left to further a career in Adult Education within the Dept. of [[TAFE]] in South Australia. He was active within the [[Australian Labor Party]] for a time.<ref>Bmusic [http://www.bmusic.com.au/links/whatsnew/newsletters/archives/newsno216.html#where Where are they now? Redgum (Updated)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911170728/http://www.bmusic.com.au/links/whatsnew/newsletters/archives/newsno216.html#where |date=11 September 2007 }}</ref>

Other members of Redgum continue to work in the Australian music scene. [[Michael Atkinson (musician)|Atkinson]] has worked in film and television.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0040771 |title=Internet Movie Database entry on Michael Atkinson |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] |access-date=3 November 2007 }}</ref> He composed the music for films including ''[[Heaven's Burning]]'' (1997), starring Russell Crowe.

Truman performs in Adelaide as a longtime member of cabaret/cover band CrossRoads.

In 2005, Redgum was again brought to attention through the recording of an acoustic / [[hip hop music|hip hop]] cover of "I Was Only 19" by Australian group [[The Herd (Australian band)|The Herd]] with Schumann providing some vocals. The song received high rotation on popular national radio station [[Triple J]]. Michael Spicer is currently teaching MIDI, Synthesis & Composition in Singapore Polytechnic.

Hugh McDonald died of cancer on 19 November 2016 at the age of 62.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.noise11.com/news/r-i-p-hugh-mcdonald-of-redgum-1954-2016-20161119|title=R.I.P. Hugh McDonald of Redgum 1954-2016|first=Paul|last=Cashmere|date=19 November 2016|website=Noise11.com}}</ref>
