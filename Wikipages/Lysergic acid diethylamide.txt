<!-- History and culture -->
LSD was first synthesized by Swiss chemist [[Albert Hofmann]] in 1938 from [[lysergic acid]], a chemical derived from the [[hydrolysis]] of [[ergotamine]], an [[alkaloid]] found in [[ergot]], a fungus that infects primarily rye among other grains.<ref name="EU2018" /><ref name="NIH2018C">{{cite web |title=Commonly Abused Drugs Charts |url=https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/commonly-abused-drugs-charts#lsd |website=National Institute on Drug Abuse |access-date=14 July 2018 |date=2 July 2018}}</ref> LSD was one of various [[lysergamides]] Hofmann synthesized from lysergic acid while working for [[Novartis|Sandoz]] in [[Basel|Basel, Switzerland]] while trying to develop a new [[respiratory stimulant]]. Hofmann discovered its effects in humans in 1943, after somehow unintentionally ingesting the substance, possibly absorbing it through his skin.<ref name="Hofmann2009">{{Cite book| vauthors = Hofmann A |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/610059315|title=LSD, my problem child: reflections on sacred drugs, mysticism, and science |date=2009 |publisher=Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies |year=2009|isbn=978-0-9798622-2-9 |edition=Fourth |location=Santa Cruz, CA|oclc=610059315}}</ref><ref name="Lee1992">{{Cite book | vauthors = Lee MA, Shlain B |url= |title=Acid dreams: the complete social history of LSD: the CIA, the Sixties, and beyond|date=1992|publisher=Grove Weidenfeld| isbn=0-8021-3062-3|edition=|location=New York|oclc=25281992}}</ref><ref name="Ettinger2017">{{cite book | vauthors = Ettinger RH |title=Psychopharmacology |date=2017 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-1-351-97870-5 |page=226 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XT4lDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA226 |language=en}}</ref> LSD was subject to exceptional interest within the field of [[psychiatry]] in the 1950s and early 1960s, with Sandoz distributing LSD to researchers under the trademark name Delysid in an attempt to find a marketable use for it.<ref name="Lee1992" /> 

LSD was initially believed to mimic [[schizophrenia]], being classified as a '[[psychotomimetic]]', and as a result was viewed as a tool to better understand how schizophrenia changes cognition subjectively. The fact that [[dopamine]] and [[mescaline]] are chemically similar – since they are both [[Substituted phenethylamine|phenethylamines]] – combined with the high potency of LSD also gave rise to the theory that schizophrenia was caused by an endogenously produced hallucinogenic substance in small enough quantities to remain undetected.<ref name="Lee1992" /> However, the psychotomimetic model was eventually abandoned due to its reported ability to induce transcendental experiences with lasting psychological benefit – in contrast to schizophrenia. A medical use for this property was pioneered in the form of LSD-assisted [[psychotherapy]] by psychiatrists such as [[Humphry Osmond]], with promising results in areas such as [[alcoholism]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Psychiatric Research with Hallucinogens|url=https://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/lsd/grob.htm|access-date=2021-07-26|website=www.druglibrary.org}}</ref><ref name="Lee1992" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chwelos N, Blewett DB, Smith CM, Hoffer A | title = Use of d-lysergic acid diethylamide in the treatment of alcoholism | journal = Quarterly Journal of Studies on Alcohol | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 577–90 | date = September 1959 | pmid = 13810249 | doi = 10.15288/qjsa.1959.20.577 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Krebs TS, Johansen PØ | title = Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) for alcoholism: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials | journal = Journal of Psychopharmacology | volume = 26 | issue = 7 | pages = 994–1002 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22406913 | doi = 10.1177/0269881112439253 | s2cid = 10677273 }}</ref> resulting in Osmond coining the term 'psychedelic' (lit. ''mind manifesting'') as a term for LSD and mescaline to replace 'psychotomimetic'. During this time, the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) was interested in LSD as an addition to its preexisting research into using [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive substances]] to aid [[interrogation]] under [[Project MKUltra]], although the CIA eventually ceased research into this in favor of the possibility of giving LSD to world leaders so that they would discredit themselves under its influence, resulting in the CIA administering LSD to unwitting test subjects in order to observe how they would react, one of the most well known examples of this being [[Operation Midnight Climax]].<ref name="Lee1992" /> LSD was one of several psychoactive substances evaluated by the [[Chemical Corps|U.S. Army Chemical Corps]] as possible non-lethal incapacitants at the [[Edgewood Arsenal human experiments|Edgewood Arsenal]] in [[Maryland]]; some of these tests were also conducted on humans.<ref name="Lee1992" /> 

In the 1960s LSD and other psychedelics were adopted by, and became synonymous with, the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture movement]] due to their perceived ability to 'expand consciousness', resulting in LSD being viewed as a cultural threat to American values and the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam war effort]] and being designated as a [[List of Schedule I drugs (US)|Schedule I]] substance in 1968.<ref>{{Cite book | author = United States Congress House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce Subcommittee on Public Health and Welfare |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qbY6xQEACAAJ|title=Increased Controls Over Hallucinogens and Other Dangerous Drugs: Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Public Health and Welfare of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, House of Representatives, Ninetieth Congress, Second Session, on H.R. 14096, a Bill to Amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to Prescribe Penalties for the Possession of LSD and Other Hallucinogenic Drugs by Unauthorized Persons : H.R. 15355, a Bill to Amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by Increasing the Penalties for Illegal Manufacture and Traffic in Hallucinogenic Drugs (including LSD) and Other Depressant and Stimulant Drugs, Including Possession of Such Drugs for Sale Or Other Disposal to Another, and by Making it a Misdemeanor to Possess Any Such Drug for One's Own Use Except when Prescribed Or Furnished by a Licensed Practitioner, and for Other Purposes (and Similar Bills), February 19, 26, 276, and March 19, 1968|date=1968|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|language=en}}</ref> It was listed as a [[schedule 1 controlled substance]] by the [[United Nations]] in 1971<ref name=EU2018/> and currently has no approved medical uses.<ref name=EU2018/>

LSD is commonly used as a recreational drug in the company of friends, in large crowds, or by oneself.<ref>{{cite web|title=DrugFacts: Hallucinogens – LSD, Peyote, Psilocybin, and PCP|url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/hallucinogens-lsd-peyote-psilocybin-pcp|publisher=National Institute on Drug Abuse|access-date=February 17, 2015|date=December 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216030833/http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/hallucinogens-lsd-peyote-psilocybin-pcp|archive-date=February 16, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Spiritual===
LSD can catalyze intense spiritual experiences and is thus considered an [[entheogen]]. Some users have reported [[out of body]] experiences. In 1966, [[Timothy Leary]] established the [[League for Spiritual Discovery]] with LSD as its [[sacrament]].<ref>{{cite book | title = Alcohol and Drugs in North America: A Historical Encyclopedia | veditors = Fahey D, Miller JS | isbn = 978-1-59884-478-8 | page = 375 }}</ref><ref>''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' September 20, 1966 Page One</ref>  [[Stanislav Grof]] has written that religious and mystical experiences observed during LSD sessions appear to be [[Empirical research|phenomenologically]] indistinguishable from similar descriptions in the [[Sacred Scriptures|sacred scriptures]] of the great religions of the world and the texts of ancient [[civilization]]s.<ref name="Grof1979">{{cite book| vauthors = Grof S, Grof JH | author-link1 = Stanislav Grof | title = Realms of the Human Unconscious (Observations from LSD Research)| publisher = Souvenir Press (E & A) Ltd| year = 1979| location = London| pages = 13–14| url = http://www.csp.org/chrestomathy/realms_of3.html| isbn = 978-0-285-64882-1| url-status=dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071018164416/http://csp.org/chrestomathy/realms_of3.html| archive-date = October 18, 2007| df = mdy-all| access-date = November 18, 2007}}</ref>

===Physical===
LSD can cause [[Mydriasis|pupil dilation]], reduced [[appetite]], profuse sweating, and wakefulness. Other physical reactions to LSD are highly variable and nonspecific, some of which may be secondary to the psychological effects of LSD. Among the reported symptoms are elevated body temperature, [[blood sugar]], and heart rate, alongside [[goose bumps]], jaw clenching, mouth dryness, and [[hyperreflexia]]. In negative experiences, numbness, weakness, nausea, and tremors have also been exhibited.<ref name="EU2018" />

===Psychological===
The most common immediate psychological effects of LSD are [[visual hallucination]]s and [[illusion]]s (colloquially known as "[[acid trip|trips]]"), which vary depending on how much is used and how the dosage interacts with the brain. Trips usually start within 20–30 minutes of taking LSD orally (less if snorted or taken intravenously), peak three to four hours after ingestion, and can last up to 20 hours in high doses. Users may also experience an "afterglow" of improved mood or perceived mental state for days or even weeks after ingestion in some experiences.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Majić T, Schmidt TT, Gallinat J | title = Peak experiences and the afterglow phenomenon: when and how do therapeutic effects of hallucinogens depend on psychedelic experiences? | journal = Journal of Psychopharmacology | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 241–53 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25670401 | doi = 10.1177/0269881114568040 | s2cid = 16483172 }}</ref> Good trips are reportedly deeply stimulating and pleasurable, and typically involve intense joy or euphoria, a greater appreciation for life, reduced anxiety, a sense of spiritual enlightenment, and a sense of belonging or interconnectedness with the universe.<ref name="erowid-faq" /><ref name="PMID6054248" /> Negative experiences, colloquially known as "bad trips," evoke an array of dark emotions, such as irrational fear, anxiety, panic, paranoia, dread, distrustfulness, hopelessness, and even [[suicidal ideation]].<ref name="cdasa" /> While it is impossible to predict when a bad trip will occur, one's mood, surroundings, sleep, hydration, social setting, and other factors can be controlled (colloquially referred to as "[[set and setting]]") to minimize the risk of a bad trip.<ref name=MedlinePlus>{{citation|title=Substance use – LSD | vauthors = Rogge T |date=21 May 2014|access-date=14 July 2016|publisher=MedlinePlus, U.S. National Library of Medicine|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000795.htm|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728004220/https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000795.htm|archive-date=July 28, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=CESAR>{{citation|title=LSD |author=CESAR |publisher=Center for Substance Abuse Research, University of Maryland |date=29 October 2013 |access-date=14 July 2016 |url=http://www.cesar.umd.edu/cesar/drugs/lsd.asp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160715071823/http://www.cesar.umd.edu/cesar/drugs/lsd.asp |archive-date=July 15, 2016 }}</ref>

===Sensory===
LSD causes an [[Animation|animated]] sensory experience of [[sense]]s, [[emotion]]s, [[memory|memories]], time, and [[awareness]] for 6 to 20 hours, depending on dosage and tolerance.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news| vauthors = Sloat S |date= 27 January 2017 |title=This is Why You Can't Escape an Hours-Long Acid Trip |work=Inverse |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/27067-lsd-acid-trip-brain-receptor-serotonin|url-status=live|access-date= 3 February 2020 }}</ref> Generally beginning within 30 to 90 minutes after ingestion, the user may experience anything from subtle changes in perception to overwhelming [[cognitive shift]]s.

Some sensory effects may include an experience of radiant or more vibrant colors, objects and surfaces appearing to ripple, "breathe," or otherwise move, spinning fractals superimposed on one's vision, colored patterns behind closed eyelids, an altered sense of time, geometric patterns emerging on walls and other textured objects, and morphing objects.<ref name="linton-langs">{{cite journal | vauthors = Linton HB, Langs RJ | year = 1962 | title = Subjective Reactions to Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD-25) | url = http://www.maps.org/w3pb/new/1962/1962_linton_2052_1.pdf | journal = Arch.

===Mental disorders===
LSD may trigger [[panic attack]]s or feelings of extreme anxiety, known colloquially as a "[[bad trip]]".

===Flashbacks===
"[[Flashback (psychology)|Flashbacks]]" are a reported psychological phenomenon in which an individual experiences an episode of some of LSD's subjective effects after the drug has worn off, persisting for months or years after [[hallucinogen]] use.<ref name="Halpern2003">{{cite journal | vauthors = Halpern JH, Pope HG | title = Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder: what do we know after 50 years? | journal = Drug and Alcohol Dependence | volume = 69 | issue = 2 | pages = 109–19 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12609692 | doi = 10.1016/S0376-8716(02)00306-X }}</ref> Individuals with [[hallucinogen persisting perception disorder]] experience intermittent or chronic flashbacks that cause distress or impairment in life and work.<ref name="Halpern2018" />

==Overdose==
A report in 2008 stated that, though there was no "comprehensive review since the 1950s" and "almost no legal clinical research" since the 1970s, there had been "no documented human deaths from an LSD overdose". Eight individuals who accidentally consumed very high amounts by mistaking LSD for cocaine developed comatose states, hyperthermia, vomiting, gastric bleeding, and respiratory problems—all survived, however, with supportive care.<ref name=Pas2008/> According to more recent reports, several behavioral-related fatalities and suicides have occurred due to LSD.<ref>{{cite web|title=LSD – National Library of Medicine HSDB Database|url=https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+3920|website=toxnet.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=21 March 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322021122/https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+3920|archive-date=March 22, 2018|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=LSD (Acid) Fatalities/Deaths|url=https://erowid.org/chemicals/lsd/lsd_death.shtml|website=Erowid|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170601225905/https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/lsd/lsd_death.shtml|archive-date=June 1, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
Reassurance in a calm, safe environment is beneficial. Agitation can be safely addressed with [[benzodiazepine]]s such as [[lorazepam]] or [[diazepam]]. [[Neuroleptic]]s such as [[haloperidol]] are not recommended because they may have adverse effects. LSD is rapidly absorbed, so [[activated carbon|activated charcoal]] and emptying of the stomach is of little benefit, unless done within 30–60 minutes of ingesting an overdose of LSD. Sedation or physical restraint is rarely required, and excessive restraint may cause complications such as [[hyperthermia]] (over-heating) or [[rhabdomyolysis]].<ref name=Medscape>{{EMedicine|article|1011615|LSD Toxicity Treatment & Management|treatment}}</ref>

Massive doses "should be treated with supportive care, including respiratory support and [[endotracheal intubation]] if needed. [[Hypertension]] [high blood pressure], [[tachycardia]] [rapid heart-beat], and hyperthermia should be treated symptomatically. [[Hypotension]] [low blood pressure] should be treated initially with fluids and subsequently with [[pressor]]s if required." "Intravenous administration of [[anticoagulants]], [[vasodilators]], and [[sympatholytics]] may be useful" when treating [[ergotism]].<ref name=Medscape/>

Most [[serotonergic psychedelic]]s are not significantly [[dopaminergic]], and LSD is therefore atypical in this regard.

==Chemistry==
[[File:Lysergide stereoisomers structural formulae v.2.png|thumb|The four possible stereoisomers of LSD. Only (+)-LSD is psychoactive.]]

LSD is a [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] compound with two [[stereocenter]]s at the [[carbon]] atoms C-5 and C-8, so that theoretically four different [[optical isomerism|optical isomers]] of LSD could exist. LSD, also called (+)-<small>D</small>-LSD,{{citation needed|reason=incorrect stereochemical notation small capital D|date=September 2018}} has the [[absolute configuration]] (5''R'',8''R''). The C-5 [[isomer]]s of lysergamides do not exist in nature and are not formed during the synthesis from [[Descriptor (chemistry)#dl|''d'']]-lysergic acid. [[Retrosynthesis|Retrosynthetically]], the C-5 stereocenter could be analysed as having the same configuration of the alpha carbon of the naturally occurring amino acid L-[[tryptophan]], the precursor to all biosynthetic ergoline compounds.

However, LSD and iso-LSD, the two C-8 isomers, rapidly interconvert in the presence of [[base (chemistry)|bases]], as the alpha proton is acidic and can be [[deprotonation|deprotonated]] and reprotonated. Non-psychoactive iso-LSD which has formed during the synthesis can be separated by [[chromatography]] and can be isomerized to LSD.

Pure salts of LSD are [[triboluminescent]], emitting small flashes of white light when shaken in the dark.<ref name="tihkal" /> LSD is strongly [[fluorescent]] and will glow bluish-white under [[UV light]].

===Reactivity and degradation===
"LSD," writes the chemist [[Alexander Shulgin]], "is an unusually fragile molecule ... As a salt, in water, cold, and free from air and light exposure, it is stable indefinitely."<ref name="tihkal" />

LSD has two [[Lability|labile]] protons at the tertiary stereogenic C5 and C8 positions, rendering these centers prone to [[epimerisation]]. The C8 proton is more labile due to the electron-withdrawing [[carboxamide]] attachment, but removal of the [[Chirality|chiral]] proton at the C5 position (which was once also an alpha proton of the parent molecule [[tryptophan]]) is assisted by the inductively withdrawing nitrogen and pi electron delocalisation with the [[indole]] ring.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

LSD also has [[enamine]]-type reactivity because of the electron-donating effects of the indole ring. Because of this, [[chlorine]] destroys LSD molecules on contact; even though chlorinated tap water contains only a slight amount of chlorine, the small quantity of compound typical to an LSD solution will likely be eliminated when dissolved in tap water.<ref name="tihkal" /> The [[covalent bond|double bond]] between the 8-position and the [[aromatic hydrocarbon|aromatic ring]], being conjugated with the indole ring, is susceptible to [[Nucleophile|nucleophilic]] attacks by water or [[alcohol]], especially in the presence of UV or other kinds of light.

A controlled study was undertaken to determine the stability of LSD in pooled urine samples.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Li Z, McNally AJ, Wang H, Salamone SJ | title = Stability study of LSD under various storage conditions | journal = Journal of Analytical Toxicology | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 520–5 | date = October 1998 | pmid = 9788528 | doi = 10.1093/jat/22.6.520 | doi-access = free }}</ref>
The concentrations of LSD in urine samples were followed over time at various temperatures, in different types of storage containers, at various exposures to different wavelengths of light, and at varying pH values. These studies demonstrated no significant loss in LSD concentration at 25&nbsp;°C for up to four weeks. After four weeks of incubation, a 30% loss in LSD concentration at 37&nbsp;°C and up to a 40% at 45&nbsp;°C were observed. Urine fortified with LSD and stored in amber glass or nontransparent polyethylene containers showed no change in concentration under any light conditions. Stability of LSD in transparent containers under light was dependent on the distance between the light source and the samples, the wavelength of light, exposure time, and the intensity of light. After prolonged exposure to heat in alkaline pH conditions, 10 to 15% of the parent LSD epimerized to iso-LSD. Under acidic conditions, less than 5% of the LSD was converted to iso-LSD. It was also demonstrated that trace amounts of metal ions in buffer or urine could catalyze the decomposition of LSD and that this process can be avoided by the addition of [[EDTA]].

===Detection===
LSD may be quantified in urine as part of a [[Drug test|drug abuse testing program]], in plasma or serum to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims or in whole blood to assist in a forensic investigation of a traffic or other criminal violation or a case of sudden death. Both the parent drug and its major metabolite are unstable in biofluids when exposed to light, heat or alkaline conditions and therefore specimens are protected from light, stored at the lowest possible temperature and analyzed quickly to minimize losses.<ref>R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 12th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2020, pp. 1197-1199.</ref>

The apparent plasma half life of LSD is considered to be around 5.1 hours with peak plasma concentrations occurring 3 hours after administration.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Papac DI, Foltz RL | title = Measurement of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in human plasma by gas chromatography/negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry | journal = Journal of Analytical Toxicology | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 189–90 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2374410 | doi = 10.1093/jat/14.3.189 }}</ref>

LSD can be detected using an [[Ehrlich's reagent]] and a Hofmann's reagent.

A similar and connected nexus of LSD use in the creative arts developed around the same time in [[London]]. A key figure in this phenomenon in the UK was British academic [[Michael Hollingshead]], who first tried LSD in America in 1961 while he was the Executive Secretary for the Institute of British-American Cultural Exchange. After being given a large quantity of pure Sandoz LSD (which was still legal at the time) and experiencing his first "trip," Hollingshead contacted [[Aldous Huxley]], who suggested that he get in touch with Harvard academic [[Timothy Leary]], and over the next few years, in concert with Leary and [[Richard Alpert]], Hollingshead played a major role in their famous LSD research at [[Millbrook, New York|Millbrook]] before moving to New York City, where he conducted his own LSD experiments. In 1965 Hollingshead returned to the UK and founded the World Psychedelic Center in [[Chelsea, London]].

===Music and art===
{{Main|LSD art}}
In both music and art, the influence of LSD was soon being more widely seen and heard thanks to the bands that participated in the Acid Tests and related events, including [[the Grateful Dead]], [[Jefferson Airplane]] and [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], and through the inventive poster and album art of San Francisco-based artists like [[Rick Griffin]], [[Victor Moscoso]], [[Bonnie MacLean]], [[Stanley Mouse]] & [[Alton Kelley]], and [[Wes Wilson]], meant to evoke the visual experience of an LSD trip. LSD had a strong influence on the Grateful Dead and the culture of "[[Deadhead]]s."<ref name=Jarnow/>

Among the many famous people in the UK that Michael Hollingshead is reputed to have introduced to LSD are artist and [[Hipgnosis]] founder [[Storm Thorgerson]], and musicians [[Donovan]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[John Lennon]], and [[George Harrison]]. Although establishment concern about the new drug led to it being declared an illegal drug by the Home Secretary in 1966, LSD was soon being used widely in the upper echelons of the British art and music scene, including members of [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[the Moody Blues]], the [[Small Faces]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Jimi Hendrix]] and others, and the products of these experiences were soon being both heard and seen by the public with singles like the Small Faces' "[[Itchycoo Park]]" and LPs like the Beatles' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' and Cream's ''[[Disraeli Gears]]'', which featured music that showed the obvious influence of the musicians' recent psychedelic excursions, and which were packaged in elaborately-designed album covers that featured vividly-coloured psychedelic artwork by artists like [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], [[Martin Sharp]], [[Hapshash and the Coloured Coat]] ([[Nigel Waymouth]] and [[Michael English (illustrator)|Michael English]]) and art/music collective [[The Fool (design collective)|The Fool]].

In the 1960s, musicians from [[psychedelic music]] and [[psychedelic rock]] bands began to refer (at first indirectly, and later explicitly) to the drug and attempted to recreate or reflect the experience of taking LSD in their music. A number of features are often included in psychedelic music.

===Legal status===
The [[United Nations]] [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] (adopted in 1971) requires the signing parties to prohibit LSD. Hence, it is illegal in all countries that were parties to the convention, including the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and most of Europe. However, enforcement of those laws varies from country to country. Medical and scientific research with LSD in humans is permitted under the 1971 UN Convention.<ref>{{cite web | work = UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances | date = 1971 | url = http://www.unodc.org/pdf/convention_1971_en.pdf | title = Final act of the United Nations Conference | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120415011336/http://www.unodc.org/pdf/convention_1971_en.pdf | archive-date = 15 April 2012 }}</ref>

In November 2009, the UK [[Transform Drug Policy Foundation]] released in the House of Commons a guidebook to the legal regulation of drugs, ''After the War on Drugs: Blueprint for Regulation'', which details options for regulated distribution and sale of LSD and other psychedelics.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tdpf.org.uk/blueprint%20download.htm | title = After the War on Drugs: Blueprint for Regulation | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131005145241/http://www.tdpf.org.uk/blueprint%20download.htm | archive-date = 5 October 2013 | work = Transform Drug Policy Foundation | date = 2009 }}</ref>

====United States====
LSD is Schedule I in the United States, according to the [[Controlled Substances Act]] of 1970.<ref>From {{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/concern/lsd.html |title=LSD |access-date=February 5, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005063651/http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/concern/lsd.html |archive-date=October 5, 2009 | quote = LSD is a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act. | work = Drug Enforcement Agency | publisher = U.S. Department of Justice }}</ref> This means LSD is illegal to manufacture, buy, possess, process, or distribute without a license from the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA). By classifying LSD as a Schedule I substance, the DEA holds that LSD meets the following three criteria: it is deemed to have a high potential for abuse; it has no legitimate medical use in treatment; and there is a lack of accepted safety for its use under medical supervision. There are no documented deaths from chemical [[toxicity]]; most LSD deaths are a result of behavioral toxicity.<ref>{{EMedicine|article|1011615|LSD Toxicity}}</ref>

There can also be substantial discrepancies between the amount of chemical LSD that one possesses and the amount of possession with which one can be charged in the US. This is because LSD is almost always present in a medium (e.g. blotter or neutral liquid), and in some contexts, the amount that can be considered with respect to sentencing is the total mass of the drug and its medium. This discrepancy was the subject of 1995 [[United States Supreme Court]] case, ''Neal v. United States'', which determined that for finding minimum sentence lengths, the total medium weight is used, while for determining the severity of the offense, an estimation of the chemical mass is used.<ref>{{cite court| litigants=Neal v.

In April 2021, the bill has been approved by the Senates Public Safety Committee and the Health Committee, in May 2021, it was cleared by the Senate Appropriations Committee and approved by the California Senate, and in June 2021, advanced by the Assembly Public Safety Committee.<ref>{{Cite web| vauthors = Jaeger K |date=2021-06-29|title=California Lawmakers Approve Bill To Legalize Psychedelics Possession In Committee|url=https://www.marijuanamoment.net/california-lawmakers-approve-bill-to-legalize-psychedelics-possession-in-committee/|access-date=2021-07-08|website=Marijuana Moment|language=en-US}}</ref>

====Mexico====
In April 2009, the [[Congress of the Union|Mexican Congress]] approved changes in the General Health Law that decriminalized the possession of illegal drugs for immediate consumption and personal use, allowing a person to possess a moderate amount of LSD. The only restriction is that people in possession of drugs should not be within a 300-meter radius of schools, police departments, or correctional facilities. Marijuana, along with cocaine, opium, heroin, and other drugs were also decriminalized; their possession is not considered a crime as long as the dose does not exceed the limit established in the General Health Law.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.elpensador.com.mx/2009/10/17/Ley-de-Narcomenudeo/ | title = Ley de Narcomenudeo | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101130224127/http://www.elpensador.com.mx/2009/10/17/Ley-de-Narcomenudeo/ | archive-date = 30 November 2010 | language = Spanish | work = El Pensador | date = 17 October 2009 }}</ref> Many{{vague|date=October 2018}} question this, as cocaine is as synthesised as heroin, and both are produced as extracts from plants.

====Czech Republic====
In the Czech Republic, until 31 December 1998 only drug possession "''for other person''" (i.e. intent to sell) was criminal (apart from production, importation, exportation, offering or mediation, which was and remains criminal) while possession for personal use remained legal.<ref name="Cz expl rep" />

On 1 January 1999, an amendment of the Criminal Code, which was necessitated in order to align the Czech drug rules with the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]], became effective, criminalizing possession of "''amount larger than small''" also for personal use (Art. 187a of the Criminal Code) while possession of small amounts for personal use became a misdemeanor.<ref name="Cz expl rep">{{Citation

===Economics===

====Price====
The street price of a single dose of LSD can be anywhere from $2 to $50.<ref>{{Cite web|title=LSD Price: How Much Is Acid Blotter, Sheet, Tab, Pyramid or Vial?|url=https://addictionresource.com/drugs/lsd/price/|website=Addiction Resource|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-13}}</ref> In Europe, as of 2011, the typical cost of a dose was between {{€}}4.50 and {{€}}25.<ref name=EU2018/>

====Production====
[[File:LSDLabGlassware.jpg|thumb|Glassware seized by the DEA]]

An active dose of LSD is very minute, allowing a large number of doses to be synthesized from a comparatively small amount of raw material. Twenty five kilograms of precursor [[ergotamine]] [[tartrate]] can produce 5–6&nbsp;kg of pure crystalline LSD; this corresponds to around 50-60&nbsp;million doses at 100&nbsp;µg. Because the masses involved are so small, concealing and transporting illicit LSD is much easier than smuggling [[cocaine]], [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], or other illegal drugs.<ref name="DEA-pub">{{cite web|author = DEA | year = 2007 | title = LSD Manufacture – Illegal LSD Production|url         = https://fas.org/irp/agency/doj/dea/product/lsd/lsd-5.htm |website  = LSD in the United States |publisher = U.S. Department of Justice Drug Enforcement Administration | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070829023659/https://fas.org/irp/agency/doj/dea/product/lsd/lsd-5.htm|archive-date = August 29, 2007}}</ref>

Manufacturing LSD requires laboratory equipment and experience in the field of [[organic chemistry]]. It takes two to three days to produce 30 to 100 grams of pure compound. It is believed that LSD is not usually produced in large quantities, but rather in a series of small batches. This technique minimizes the loss of precursor chemicals in case a step does not work as expected.<ref name="DEA-pub" />{{Dead link|date=January 2015}}

=====Forms=====
[[File:5 LSD blotters.png|thumb|Five doses of LSD, often called a "five strip"]]

LSD is produced in crystalline form and is then mixed with [[excipient]]s or redissolved for production in ingestible forms. Liquid solution is either distributed in small vials or, more commonly, sprayed onto or soaked into a distribution medium. Historically, LSD solutions were first sold on sugar cubes, but practical considerations forced a change to [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]] form. Appearing in 1968 as an orange tablet measuring about 6&nbsp;mm across, "Orange Sunshine" acid was the first largely available form of LSD after its possession was made illegal. [[Tim Scully]], a prominent chemist, made some of these tablets, but said that most "Sunshine" in the USA came by way of Ronald Stark, who imported approximately thirty-five million doses from Europe.<ref name=Stafford1992>{{cite book | vauthors = Stafford P | year = 1992 | title = Psychedelics Encyclopaedia | chapter = Chapter 1 – The LSD Family | pages =  62 | edition = Third Expanded | publisher = Ronin Publishing Inc | isbn = 978-0-914171-51-5 }}</ref>

Over a period of time, tablet dimensions, weight, shape and concentration of LSD evolved from large (4.5–8.1&nbsp;mm diameter), heavyweight (≥150&nbsp;mg), round, high concentration (90–350&nbsp;µg/tab) dosage units to small (2.0–3.5&nbsp;mm diameter) lightweight (as low as 4.7&nbsp;µg/tab), variously shaped, lower concentration (12–85&nbsp;µg/tab, average range 30–40&nbsp;µg/tab) dosage units. LSD tablet shapes have included cylinders, cones, stars, spacecraft, and heart shapes. The smallest tablets became known as "Microdots."<ref name=Laing2003>{{cite book | vauthors = Laing RR, Beyerstein BL, Siegel JA | year = 2003 | title = Hallucinogens: A Forensic Drug Handbook | chapter = Chapter 2.2 – Forms of the Drug | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=l1DrqgobbcwC | pages = 39–41 | publisher = Academic Press | isbn = 978-0-12-433951-4 }}</ref>

After tablets came "computer acid" or "blotter paper LSD," typically made by dipping a preprinted sheet of [[blotting paper]] into an LSD/water/alcohol solution.<ref name=Stafford1992/><ref name=Laing2003/> More than 200 types of LSD tablets have been encountered since 1969 and more than 350 blotter paper designs have been observed since 1975.<ref name=Laing2003/> About the same time as blotter paper LSD came "Windowpane" (AKA "Clearlight"), which contained LSD inside a thin [[gelatin]] square a quarter of an inch (6&nbsp;mm) across.<ref name=Stafford1992/> <!-- Please do not add any street names here unless you can provide evidence for their notability and importance!

=====Modern distribution=====
LSD manufacturers and traffickers in the [[United States]] can be categorized into two groups: A few large-scale producers, and an equally limited number of small, clandestine chemists, consisting of independent producers who, operating on a comparatively limited scale, can be found throughout the country.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = MacLean JR, Macdonald DC, Ogden F, Wilby E | chapter = LSD-25 and mescaline as therapeutic adjuvants. | veditors = Abramson H | title = The Use of LSD in Psychotherapy and Alcoholism | publisher = Bobbs-Merrill | location = New York | date = 1967 | pages = 407–426 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Ditman KS, Bailey JJ | chapter = Evaluating LSD as a psychotherapeutic agent | veditors = Hoffer A | title = A program for the treatment of alcoholism: LSD, malvaria, and nicotinic acid | pages = 353–402 }}</ref>

As a group, independent producers are of less concern to the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] than the large-scale groups because their product reaches only local markets.<ref>^ LSD: The Drug</ref>

Many LSD dealers and chemists describe a religious or humanitarian purpose that motivates their illicit activity. Nicholas Schou's book ''Orange Sunshine: The Brotherhood of Eternal Love and Its Quest to Spread Peace, Love, and Acid to the World'' describes one such group, [[the Brotherhood of Eternal Love]]. The group was a major American LSD trafficking group in the late 1960s and early 1970s.<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Schou N |title=Orange Sunshine: The Brotherhood of Eternal Love and Its Quest to Spread Peace, Love, and Acid to the World|url=https://archive.org/details/orangesunshinebr00scho_0|url-access=registration|date=2010|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|isbn=9780312551834}}</ref>

In the second half of the 20th century, dealers and chemists loosely associated with the [[Grateful Dead]] like [[Owsley Stanley]], [[Nicholas Sand]], Karen Horning, Sarah Maltzer, "Dealer McDope," and [[Leonard Pickard]] played an essential role in distributing LSD.<ref name=Jarnow>{{cite book| vauthors = Jarnow J |title=Heads: A Biography of Psychedelic America|date=2016|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=9780306822551}}</ref>

Many street users of LSD are often under the impression that blotter paper which is actively hallucinogenic can only be LSD because that is the only chemical with low enough doses to fit on a small square of blotter paper. While it is true that LSD requires lower doses than most other hallucinogens, blotter paper is capable of absorbing a much larger amount of material. The DEA performed a [[chromatography|chromatographic]] analysis of blotter paper containing [[2C-C]] which showed that the paper contained a much greater concentration of the active chemical than typical LSD doses, although the exact quantity was not determined.<ref name="microgram november 2005">{{Cite journal | journal = Microgram Bulletin | date = November 2005 | volume = 38 | issue = 11 | author = United States Drug Enforcement Administration | url = http://www.justice.gov/dea/pr/micrograms/2005/mg1105.pdf | title = Bulk Marijuana in Hazardous Packaging in Chicago, Illinois | access-date = August 20, 2009 | url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121018052300/http://www.justice.gov/dea/pr/micrograms/2005/mg1105.pdf | archive-date = October 18, 2012 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Blotter LSD mimics can have relatively small dose squares; a sample of blotter paper containing [[2,5-Dimethoxy-4-chloroamphetamine|DOC]] seized by [[Concord, California]] police had dose markings approximately 6&nbsp;mm apart.<ref name="microgram december 2007">{{Cite journal | journal = Microgram Bulletin | date = December 2007 | volume = 40 | issue = 12 | author = United States Drug Enforcement Administration | url = http://www.justice.gov/dea/pr/micrograms/2007/mg1207.pdf | title = SMALL HEROIN DISKS NEAR GREENSBORO, GEORGIA | access-date = August 20, 2009 | url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121017234332/http://www.justice.gov/dea/pr/micrograms/2007/mg1207.pdf | archive-date = October 17, 2012 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Several deaths have been attributed to 25I-NBOMe.<ref name="Erowid25I-NBOMe">{{cite web | url=https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/2ci_nbome/2ci_nbome_death.shtml | title=25I-NBOMe (2C-I-NBOMe) Fatalities / Deaths | publisher=Erowid | website=Drug Website | access-date=February 28, 2016 | author=Erowid | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305193143/https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/2ci_nbome/2ci_nbome_death.shtml | archive-date=March 5, 2016 | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="NY Daily news">{{cite news| vauthors = Hastings D |title=New drug N-bomb hits the street, terrifying parents, troubling cops|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/new-synthetic-hallucinogen-n-bomb-killing-users-cops-article-1.1336327|access-date=May 7, 2013|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=May 6, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510103039/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/new-synthetic-hallucinogen-n-bomb-killing-users-cops-article-1.1336327|archive-date=May 10, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="Ireland injuries">{{cite news| vauthors = Feehan C |title=Powerful N-Bomb drug – responsible for spate of deaths internationally – responsible for hospitalisation of six in Cork|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/powerful-nbomb-drug-responsible-for-spate-of-deaths-internationally-responsible-for-hospitalisation-of-six-in-cork-34384507.html|access-date=January 22, 2016|newspaper=Irish Independent|date=January 21, 2016}}</ref><ref name="ACMD Report2">{{cite web| vauthors = Iversen L |title=Temporary Class Drug Order Report on 5-6APB and NBOMe compounds|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/204808/J_TCDO_report_on_5-6APB_and_NBOMe_compounds.pdf|website=Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs|publisher=Gov.Uk|access-date=June 16, 2013|date=May 29, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921234700/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/204808/J_TCDO_report_on_5-6APB_and_NBOMe_compounds.pdf|archive-date=September 21, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Psychedelic therapy===
{{see also|Psychedelic therapy}}
In the 1950s and 1960s LSD was used in psychiatry to enhance psychotherapy known as [[psychedelic therapy]]. Some psychiatrists{{who|date=January 2015}} believed LSD was especially useful at helping patients to "unblock" repressed subconscious material through other [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] methods,<ref>Cohen, S.

Zabriskie Point was filled with the sound of a kindergarten playground overlaid with electric tonalities. ''Kontakte'' followed. [[Glissando]]s bounced off the stars, which glowed like incandescent pinballs. Foucault turned to Michael and said this is the first time he really understood what Stockhausen had achieved".</ref> According to Wade, as soon as he came back to Paris, Foucault scrapped the second History of Sexuality's manuscript, and totally rethought the whole project.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Foucault in California: [A True Story-–Wherein the Great French Philosopher Drops Acid in the Valley of Death]| vauthors = Wade S |publisher=Heyday Books|year=2019|isbn=9781597144636}} In a letter to Wade, dated 16 September 1978, Foucault authorised the book's publication and added: "How could I not love you?"</ref>
