==Formation==
A Great Big Pile of Leaves formed when Farewell to Arms, a band that Weiland and Soucy were in, split up. The duo then moved from [[Connecticut]] to [[Brooklyn, New York]] and released their first two EPs. Tucker Yaro then joined the band as the bassist and they began playing live shows. Along with their music, the band are known for their unique name. In an interview with ''[[AMP (magazine)|AMP]]'', Tyler Soucy, the band's drummer, said that Weiland and himself "would always go to this brewery in [his] hometown after writing and recording. We’d sit there for hours talking about names, Google searching to see what had been taken, and it probably took us about a month to settle on the name A Great Big Pile of Leaves. It was actually one of Pete’s first suggestions and it seemed to be the name that we kept circling back to, and one day it just stuck. I think it’s pretty memorable and I’d like to think it stands out from the sea of band names out there today." He also described the name as being "a throwback to being a kid and having fun".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ampmagazine.com/28105/tyler-soucy-of-a-great-big-pile-of-leaves-talks-about-the-bands-founding-working-with-a-producer-for-the-first-time-and-touring-with-bands-like-motion-city-soundtrack-and-say-anything/ |title=AMP Magazine – Tyler Soucy of A Great Big Pile of Leaves talks about the band's founding, working with a producer for the first time, and touring with bands like Motion City Soundtrack and Say Anything |work=[[AMP (magazine)|AMP]]|date=2012-03-01 |accessdate=2012-11-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421115718/http://www.ampmagazine.com/28105/tyler-soucy-of-a-great-big-pile-of-leaves-talks-about-the-bands-founding-working-with-a-producer-for-the-first-time-and-touring-with-bands-like-motion-city-soundtrack-and-say-anything/ |archivedate=2012-04-21 }}</ref>
