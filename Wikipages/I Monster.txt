'''I Monster''' are an English [[electronic music]] duo, composed of the [[Sheffield]] based record producers Dean Honer and Jarrod Gosling.

I Monster and its label Twins of Evil are both named after [[horror film]]s starring [[Peter Cushing]] (i.e., ''[[I, Monster]]'' and ''[[Twins of Evil]]'').<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.whoaretheymag.com/2012/11/imonsterinterview.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 October 2014 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141008031655/http://www.whoaretheymag.com/2012/11/imonsterinterview.html |archive-date=8 October 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==History==
===Formation and ''These Are Our Children''===
They formed in 1997 and released their debut [[album]] ''These Are Our Children'' in 1998. However, due to Honer being involved with hitmakers [[All Seeing I]], it was not until 2001 that they released their first [[single (music)|single]], "Daydream in Blue", a [[remix]] of The Gunter Kallmann Choir's version of The Wallace Collection's "[[Daydream (Wallace Collection song)|Daydream]]". The song was originally released on 7" on Honer's own [[record label]] Cercle Records, which he founded with [[Add N to (X)]]'s Barry Seven. It was later re-released with a new mix on [[Instant Karma (record label)|Instant Karma]] (in association with their own label Twins of Evil); which has also released material from [[Kings Have Long Arms]] and Mu Chan Clan.  The song also featured on episode 3 of season 1 in the [[BBC Television]] television drama ''[[Hustle (TV series)|Hustle]]''. The track peaked at #20 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in June 2001.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

The members are regular guest [[Disc jockey|DJ]]s across the country and have played live shows in [[London]] and at various [[Europe]]an [[music festival]]s. Part of the live band is made up of Fred de Fred and Marion Benoist from [[The Lovers (band)|The Lovers]], on [[guitar]] and [[human voice|vocals]] respectively. Bonus tracks and rarities from "Neveroddoreven" were released on the albums ''Rare'' and ''Remixed'' (both 2012).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musicforstowaways.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/i-monster-rare/|title=I Monster – Rare|website=Musicforstowaways.wordpress.com|date=28 February 2013|access-date=2020-06-21}}</ref>

===''Fast, Cheap and Out of Control''===
In 2007, I Monster started collaborating with Finnish pop artist, [[HK119]], for her second album.  The resulting project, ''[[Fast, Cheap and Out of Control (album)|Fast, Cheap and Out of Control]]'' was released in September 2008 on [[One Little Indian Records]], and saw I Monster co-write and co-produce over three quarters of the album. This collaboration came from Dean Honers previous role as a remixer for HK119's debut single, "Pick Me Up", from her debut eponymous album in 2006.

===''A Dense Swarm of Ancient Stars''===
In 2009, the band released the follow-up to ''Neveroddoreven'', titled ''A Dense Swarm of Ancient Stars'', their third album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dense-Swarm-Ancient-Stars/dp/B001R6TSXG/|title=Released on Amazon MP3 Download Store on 16 March 2009|website=Amazon.co.uk|access-date=2020-06-21}}</ref>
