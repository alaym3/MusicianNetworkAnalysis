Billed as "The Only Band That Matters", they also contributed to the {{nowrap|[[post-punk]]}} and [[new wave music|new wave]] movements that emerged in the wake of punk and employed elements of a variety of genres including [[reggae]], [[Dub music|dub]], [[funk]], [[ska]], and [[rockabilly]]. For most of their recording career, the Clash consisted of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist [[Joe Strummer]], lead guitarist and vocalist [[Mick Jones (The Clash guitarist)|Mick Jones]], bassist [[Paul Simonon]], and drummer [[Topper Headon|Nicky "Topper" Headon]]. Headon left the group in 1982 due to internal friction surrounding his increasing heroin addiction and it was more internal friction which led to Jones' departure the following year. The group continued with new members, but finally disbanded in early 1986.

The Clash achieved critical and commercial success in the United Kingdom with the release of their self-titled debut album, ''[[The Clash (album)|The Clash]]'' (1977) which continued with their second album, ''[[Give 'Em Enough Rope]]'' (1978). Their experimental third album, ''[[London Calling]]'', released in the UK in December 1979, earned them popularity in the United States when it was released there the following month. It was declared the best album of the 1980s a decade later by ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. Following continued musical experimentation on their fourth album, ''[[Sandinista!]]'' (1980), the band reached new heights of success with the release of ''[[Combat Rock]]'' (1982), which spawned the US top 10 hit "[[Rock the Casbah]]", helping the album to achieve a 2× Platinum certification there. A final album, ''[[Cut the Crap]]'', was released in 1985,<ref name="bbcco-Strummer_dies">{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2600669.stm | title = Clash star Strummer dies | access-date =20 November 2007 | date = 27 December 2002 | format = STM | work=Entertainment | publisher=BBC News World Edition}}</ref> and a few weeks later, the band broke up.

In January 2003, shortly after the death of Joe Strummer, the band—including original drummer [[Terry Chimes]]—were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. In 2004, ''Rolling Stone'' ranked the Clash number 28 on its [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time"]].<ref name="rollingstone.com-30_the_clash">{{cite web | title = The Clash by The Edge | work = Rolling Stone Issue 946 | date = 15 April 2004 | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/5702/31963/32154 | access-date = 15 September 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101207053013/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/5702/31963/32154 | archive-date = 7 December 2010 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

==History==

===Origins: 1974–1976===
Before the Clash's founding, the band's future members were active in different parts of the London music scene.

[[Joe Strummer|John Graham Mellor]] sang and played rhythm guitar in the [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|pub rock]] act [[The 101ers]], which formed in 1974. By the time the Clash came together two years later, he had already abandoned his original stage name, "Woody" Mellor, in favour of "Joe Strummer", a reference to his rudimentary [[Strum|strumming]] skills on the ukulele as a [[Busking|busker]] in the [[London Underground]].

[[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]] played guitar in [[protopunk]] band [[London SS]], which rehearsed for much of 1975 without ever playing a live show and recording only a single demo. London SS were managed by [[Bernard Rhodes]], a sometime associate of impresario [[Malcolm McLaren]] and a friend of the members of the McLaren-managed band, the [[Sex Pistols]]. Jones and his bandmates became friendly with Sex Pistols [[Glen Matlock]] and [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]], who would assist them as they tried out potential new members.{{sfn|Robb|2006|pp=130–132}} Among those who auditioned for London SS without making the cut were [[Paul Simonon]], who tried out as a vocalist,{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=72}} and drummer [[Terry Chimes]]. [[Topper Headon|Nicky Headon]] drummed with the band for a week, then quit.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=56}}<ref name=Gilmore>{{cite magazine|last=Gilmore|first=Mikal|title=The Fury and the Power of the Clash|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=3 March 2011|issue=1125|pages=60–79}}</ref>

After London SS broke up in early 1976, Rhodes continued as Jones' manager. In February, Jones saw the Sex Pistols perform for the first time: "You knew straight away that was it, and this was what it was going to be like from now on. It was a new scene, new values—so different from what had happened before. A bit dangerous."{{sfn|Robb|2006|p=151}} At the instigation of Rhodes, Jones contacted Simonon in March, suggesting he learn an instrument so he could join the new band Jones was organising.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=72}} Soon Jones, Simonon on bass, [[Keith Levene]] on guitar and "whoever we could find really to play the drums" were rehearsing.<ref name="bass player">{{cite journal

}}</ref> Chimes was asked to audition for the new band and got the job, although he soon quit.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=79}}

The band was still searching for a lead singer. Chimes recalls one Billy Watts (who "seemed to be, like, nineteen or eighteen then, as we all were") handling the duties for a time.{{sfn|Strongman|2008|p=103}} Rhodes had his eye on Strummer, with whom he made exploratory contact. Jones and Levene had both seen him perform and were impressed as well.{{sfn|Robb|2006|pp=192, 193}} Strummer, for his part, was primed to make the switch. In April, he had taken in the opening act for one of his band's gigs—the Sex Pistols. Strummer later explained:<blockquote>I knew something was up, so I went out in the crowd which was fairly sparse. And I saw the future—with a snotty handkerchief—right in front of me. It was immediately clear. Pub rock was, "Hello, you bunch of drunks, I'm gonna play these boogies and I hope you like them." The Pistols came out that Tuesday evening and their attitude was, "Here's our tunes, and we couldn't give a flying fuck whether you like them or not. In fact, we're gonna play them even if you fucking hate them."<ref name="joestrummer.us2">{{cite web|url=http://www.joestrummer.us/?n9P81fmSnwwFUbhFAMuAAxe6bb31IUP&p=2&aOHDhtT57WPxn9Z7bWGQa3BBQbFVu17LfZSa&c=1&CxeQAdg5hVrrDtzOUCasLrnVGV7&XUZHs|title=Interview|year=2000|publisher=Joe Strummer Resource|work=Record Collector|access-date=5 December 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005220200/http://www.joestrummer.us/?n9P81fmSnwwFUbhFAMuAAxe6bb31IUP&p=2&aOHDhtT57WPxn9Z7bWGQa3BBQbFVu17LfZSa&c=1&CxeQAdg5hVrrDtzOUCasLrnVGV7&XUZHs|archive-date=5 October 2011}}</ref></blockquote>On 30 May, Rhodes and Levene approached Strummer after a 101'ers gig and invited him to meet up at the band's rehearsal location on Davis Road. After Strummer turned up, Levene played "Keys to Your Heart", one of Strummer's own tunes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mudkiss.com/keithleveneinterview.htm |title=keithleveneinterview – MUDKISS FANZINE |publisher=Mudkiss.com |access-date=17 April 2014 |archive-date=23 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123144317/http://www.mudkiss.com/keithleveneinterview.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Rhodes gave Strummer 48 hours to decide whether he wanted to join the new band that would "rival the Pistols." Within 24 hours, he agreed.<ref>According to band biographer Marcus Gray (2005), "Bernie phoned him a day ahead of schedule, and demanded an answer there and then" (p. 127). In ''Westway to the World'', Jones confirms the 48-hour deadline, while Strummer says it was he who made the call after just 24 (11:34–11:40). Jones elsewhere gave a different account, according to which Strummer was originally given 24 hours to decide, and Rhodes called after just eight ([[#CITEREFRobb2006|Robb 2006]], p. 194).</ref> Simonon later remarked, "Once we had Joe on board it all started to come together."<ref name="bass player" /> Strummer introduced the band to his old school friend Pablo LaBritain, who sat in on drums during Strummer's first few rehearsals with the group. LaBritain's stint with the band did not last long (he subsequently joined [[999 (band)|999]]), and Terry Chimes—whom Jones later referred to as "one of the best drummers" in their circle—became the band's regular drummer.{{sfn|Letts|2001|loc=17:16–17:22}}

In ''Westway to the World'', Jones also says, "I don't think Terry was officially hired or anything. He had just been playing with us."<ref>According to Gray (2005), Rhodes asked Chimes to rejoin (pp.&nbsp;133–34).</ref> Chimes did not take to Strummer at first: "He was like twenty-two or twenty-three or something that seemed 'old' to me then. And he had these retro clothes and this croaky voice".{{sfn|Strongman|2008|p=103}} Simonon came up with the band's name after they had briefly dubbed themselves the Weak Heartdrops and the Psychotic Negatives.<ref name="MTV-Rockumentary">{{cite web | title = MTV Rockumentary | author= Presenter: Kurt Loder | publisher = MTV | location = London, England | url = http://www.londonsburning.org/art_mtv_rockumentary_1.html | website = Londonsburning.org | access-date = 6 December 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20010303040150/http://londonsburning.org/art_mtv_rockumentary_1.html | archive-date = 3 March 2001 | url-status = dead }}</ref>{{sfn|Topping|2004|p=12}} He later explained the name's origin: "It really came to my head when I started reading the newspapers and a word that kept recurring was the word 'clash', so I thought 'the Clash, what about that,' to the others. And they and Bernard, they went for it."<ref name="MTV-Rockumentary" />

===Early gigs and the growing scene: 1976===
After rehearsing with Strummer for less than a month, the Clash made their debut on 4 July 1976, supporting the Sex Pistols at the [[Boardwalk (nightclub)|Black Swan]] in [[Sheffield]]. The band apparently wanted to make it on-stage before their rivals in [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]]—another London SS spinoff—made their own scheduled debut two days later. The Clash would not play in front of an audience again for another five weeks.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=143}}<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> Levene was becoming disaffected with his position in the group. At the Black Swan, he approached the Sex Pistols' lead singer, [[John Lydon]] (then going by Johnny Rotten), and suggested they form a band together if the Pistols broke up.{{sfn|Robb|2006|p=196}}

Hours after their debut, the band members along with most of the Sex Pistols and much of the rest of London's "inner circle" of punks showed up at [[Dingwalls]] club to attend a concert by [[New York City|New York]]'s leading punk rock band, the [[Ramones]]. Afterward "came the first example of the rivalry-induced squabbling that was to dog the punk scene and undermine any attempts to promote a spirit of unity among the bands involved."{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=144}} Simonon got into a scuffle with [[Jean-Jacques Burnel|J.J. Burnel]], the bass player of [[the Stranglers]]. A slightly older band, the Stranglers were publicly identified with the punk scene, but were not part of the "inner circle" centered on the Sex Pistols.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=144}}

With Rhodes insisting that the band not perform live again until they were much tighter, the Clash rehearsed intensely over the following month. Strummer later described how seriously the band devoted itself to forging a distinct identity: "We were almost Stalinist in the way that you had to shed all your friends, or everything that you'd known, or every way that you'd played before."{{sfn|Letts|2001|loc=14:57–15:08}} Strummer and Jones shared most of the writing duties—"Joe would give me the words and I would make a song out of them", Jones later said.{{sfn|Robb|2006|p=326}} Sometimes they would meet in the office over their [[Camden Town|Camden]] rehearsal studio to collaborate directly.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=144}} According to a later description of Strummer's, "Bernie [Rhodes] would say, 'An issue, an issue. Don't write about love, write about what's affecting you, what's important."<ref>[[#CITEREFSavage1992|Savage 1992]], p. 232. Jones's later take on the matter: "Bernie had a hand in everything. Not the lyrics—he didn't help with the lyrics. He didn't tell us not to write love songs, as the myth goes—that's kind of simplified version of it. He told us to write what we knew about" ([[#CITEREFRobb2006|Robb 2006]], p. 197).</ref>

Strummer took the lead vocals on the majority of songs; in some cases he and Jones shared the lead. Once the band began recording, Jones would rarely have a solo lead on more than one song per album, though he would be responsible for two of the group's biggest hits. On 13 August, the Clash—sporting a paint-spattered "[[Jackson Pollock]]" look—played before a small, invitation-only audience in their Camden studio.{{sfn|Robb|2006|pp=195–197}} Among those in attendance was ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' critic [[Giovanni Dadamo]]. His review described the band as a "runaway train&nbsp;... so powerful, they're the first new group to come along who can really scare the Sex Pistols shitless".{{sfn|Strongman|2008|p=133}}

On 29 August, the Clash and [[Manchester]]'s [[Buzzcocks]] opened for the Sex Pistols at The Screen on the Green, the Clash's first public performance since 4 July. The triple bill is seen as pivotal to the British punk scene's crystallisation into a movement,{{sfn|Robb|2006|pp=212–215}} though ''[[New Musical Express|NME]]'' reviewer Charles Shaar Murray wrote, "The Clash are the sort of garage band that should be speedily returned to the garage, preferably with the motor still running".{{sfn|Salewicz|2006|p=162}} Strummer later credited Murray's comments with inspiring the band's composition [[Garageland (song)|"Garageland"]].{{sfn|Letts|2001|loc=24:23–24:43}}

In early September, Levene was fired from the Clash. Strummer would claim that Levene's dwindling interest in the band owed to his supposedly extravagant use of [[Amphetamine|speed]], a charge Levene has denied.{{sfn|Robb|2006|pp=215–216}}{{sfn|Savage|1992|p=220}} Levene and Lydon would form [[Public Image Ltd.]] in 1978. On 21 September, the Clash performed publicly for the first time without Levene at another seminal concert: the [[100 Club Punk Special]], sharing the bill with the Sex Pistols, [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] and [[Subway Sect]].{{sfn|Gray|2005|pp=164–166}}{{sfn|Robb|2006|pp=216–223}}<ref>{{cite web

By the turn of the year, punk had become a major media phenomenon in the UK. On 25 January 1977, the Clash signed to [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] for £100,000, a remarkable amount for a band that had played a total of about thirty gigs and almost none as a headliner.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=216}} As Clash historian Marcus Gray describes, the "band members found themselves having to justify [the deal] to both the music press and to fans who picked up on the critics' muttered asides about the Clash having 'sold out' to the establishment."{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=217}} [[Mark Perry (musician)|Mark Perry]], founder of the leading London punk periodical, ''[[Sniffin' Glue]]'', let loose with what he would later call his "big quote": "Punk died the day the Clash signed to CBS."{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=218}} As one band associate described it, the deal "was later used as a classic example of the kind of contract that no group should ever sign—the group had to pay for their own tours, recordings, remixes, artwork, expenses&nbsp;..."<ref>Roadent, quoted in [[#CITEREFStrongman2008|Strongman 2008]], p. 199.</ref>

Mickey Foote, who worked as a technician at their concerts, was hired to produce the Clash's debut album, and Terry Chimes was drafted back for the recording. The band's first single, "[[White Riot]]", was released in March 1977 and reached number 34. The album, ''[[The Clash (album)|The Clash]]'', came out the following month. Filled with fiery punk tracks, it also presaged the many eclectic turns the band would take with its cover of the reggae song "[[Police and Thieves]]". "Amidst the Sex Pistols' inertia in the first half of 1977, the Clash found themselves as the flag-wavers of the punk rock consciousness", according to music journalist and former punk musician [[John Robb (musician)|John Robb]].{{sfn|Robb|2006|p=325}} Though the album charted well in the UK, climbing quickly to number 12, CBS refused to give it a US release, believing that its raw, barely produced sound would make it unmarketable there.{{sfn|Gimarc|2005|p=61}} A North American version of the album, with a modified track listing, was eventually released in the US two years later in 1979, after the UK original became the best-selling import album of the year in the United States.<ref name="RS198004-The_Clash">{{cite magazine| last = Henke| first = James| date = 3 April 1980| title = There'll Be Dancing In The Streets: The Clash|magazine=Rolling Stone | pages = 38–41}}</ref>

Chimes, whose career aspirations owed little to the punk ethos, had left the band again soon after the recording sessions. He later said, "The point was I wanted one kind of life and they wanted another and, like, why are we working together, if we want completely different things?"{{sfn|Letts|2001|loc=18:09–18:16}} As a result, only Simonon, Jones and Strummer were featured on the album's cover, and Chimes was credited as "[[Tory]] Crimes". Strummer later described what followed: "We must have tried every drummer that then had a kit. I mean every drummer in London. I think we counted 205. And that's why we were lost until we found Topper Headon."{{sfn|Letts|2001|loc=30:30–30:41}}  Headon, who had played briefly with Jones's London SS, was nicknamed "Topper" by Simonon, who felt he resembled the [[Topper (comic book)|''Topper'' comic book]] character [[Mickey the Monkey]].<ref>[[#CITEREFGray2005|Gray 2005]], p. 244. Gray misspells the character's name as Micky.</ref> An excellent musician, Headon could also play piano, bass and guitar. The day after he signed up, he declared, "I really wanted to join the Clash. I want to give them even more energy than they've got—if that's possible";{{sfn|Coon|1977}} interviewed over two decades later, he said his original plan was to stay briefly, gain a name for himself, and then move on to a better gig.{{sfn|Letts|2001|loc=38:07–38:11, 38:33–38:35}} In any event, Strummer later observed, "Finding someone who not only had the chops, but the strength and the stamina to do it was just the breakthrough for us".{{sfn|Letts|2001|loc=38:35–38:44}}

In May, the band set out on the White Riot Tour, headlining a punk package that included the Buzzcocks, Subway Sect, [[the Slits]] and [[the Prefects]].{{sfn|Robb|2006|pp=329–339}} The day after a Newcastle gig, Strummer and Headon were arrested for stealing pillowcases from their hotel room.{{sfn|Robb|2006|p=338}} That same month, CBS released "[[Remote Control (The Clash song)|Remote Control]]" as the debut LP's second single, defying the wishes of the band, who saw it as one of the album's weakest tracks.{{sfn|Strongman|2008|pp=201–202}} Headon's first recording with the band was the single "[[Complete Control]]", which addressed the band's anger at their record label's behaviour. It was co-produced by famed reggae artist [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]], though Foote was summoned to "ground things" a bit and the result was pure punk rock. Released in September 1977—''[[NME]]'' noted how CBS allowed the group to "bait their masters"—it rose to number 28 on the British chart and has gone on to be cited as one of punk's greatest singles.{{sfn|Strongman|2008|pp=203–204}}<ref name=RS500Songs>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/500songs/page/4 |title=The RS 500 Greatest Songs of All Time |access-date=22 November 2007 |date=9 December 2004 |magazine=RollingStone |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071120033613/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/500songs/page/4 |archive-date = 20 November 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> In February 1978, the band came out with the single "[[Clash City Rockers]]". June saw the release of "[[(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais]]", which surprised fans with its reggae rhythm and arrangement.

Before the Clash began recording their second album, CBS requested that they adopt a cleaner sound than its predecessor in order to reach American audiences. [[Sandy Pearlman]], known for his work with [[Blue Öyster Cult]], was hired to produce the record. Simonon later recalled, "[R]ecording that album was just the most boring situation ever. It was just so nitpicking, such a contrast to the first album&nbsp;... it ruined any spontaneity."{{sfn|Letts|2001|loc=42:43–42:56}} Strummer agreed that "it wasn't our easiest session."{{sfn|Ferraz|2001}} Although some listeners complained about its relatively mainstream production style, ''[[Give 'Em Enough Rope]]'' received largely positive reviews upon its November release.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=291–292}}<ref>{{cite web |last=Marcus |first=Greil |author-link=Greil Marcus |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/theclash/albums/album/248769/review/5940574/give_em_enough_rope |title=The Clash: Give 'Em Enough Rope |access-date=29 March 2008 |date=25 January 1979 | work=Rolling Stone|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080318055407/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/theclash/albums/album/248769/review/5940574/give_em_enough_rope |archive-date = 18 March 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> It hit number 2 in the UK, but it was not the American breakthrough CBS had hoped for, reaching only number 128 on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard charts|chart]]. The album's first UK single, the hard rocking "[[Tommy Gun (song)|Tommy Gun]]", rose to number 19, the highest chart position for a Clash single to date. In support of the album, the band toured the UK supported by the Slits and [[The Innocents (UK punk band)|the Innocents]].

The band subsequently undertook its first, largely successful tour of North America in February 1979.<ref>Kozak, Roman (3 March 1979). "Surprisingly Few Clashes Noted As the Clash Tours the Nation".

In August and September 1979, the Clash recorded ''[[London Calling]]''. Produced by [[Guy Stevens]], a former [[A&R]] executive who had worked with [[Mott the Hoople]] and [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], the double album was a mix of punk rock, reggae, ska, rockabilly, traditional rock and roll and other elements possessed of an energy that had hardly flagged since the band's early days and more polished production.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> Its final track, a relatively straightforward rock and roll number sung by Mick Jones called "[[Train in Vain]]", was included at the last minute and thus did not appear in the track listing on the cover. It became their first US Top 40 hit, peaking at number 23 on the ''Billboard'' chart. In the UK, where "Train in Vain" was not released as a single, ''London Calling'''s [[London Calling (song)|title track]], stately in beat but unmistakably punk in message and tone, rose to number 11—the highest position any Clash single reached in the UK before the band's break-up.

Released in December, ''London Calling'' hit number 9 on the British chart; in the United States, where it was issued in January 1980, it reached number 27. The cover of the album, based on the cover of [[Elvis Presley]]'s self-titled [[Elvis Presley (album)|1956 debut LP]], became one of the best known in the history of rock.<ref name=BBC2010/> Its image, by photographer [[Pennie Smith]], of Simonon smashing his bass guitar was later cited as the "best rock 'n roll photograph of all time" by ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite news|author=Battersby, Matilda|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/london-calling-top-uk-artists-pay-tribute-to-the-clashs-war-artist-2000876.html|title=London Calling: Tracey Emin and friends pay tribute to the Clash's 'official war artist'|date=16 June 2010|access-date=17 June 2010|work=The Independent|location=UK|archive-date=19 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619233517/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/london-calling-top-uk-artists-pay-tribute-to-the-clashs-war-artist-2000876.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=503}} During this period, the Clash began to be regularly billed as "The Only Band That Matters".

Around the turn of the year, the band members attended a special private screening of a new film, ''[[Rude Boy (film)|Rude Boy]]''; part fiction, part [[rockumentary]], it tells the story of a Clash fan who leaves his job in a [[Soho]] sex shop to become a roadie for the group. The movie—named after the [[rude boy]] subculture—includes footage of the band on tour, at a London [[Rock Against Racism]] concert, and in the studio recording ''Give 'Em Enough Rope.'' The band was so disenchanted with it that they had [[Better Badges]] make buttons that declared "I don't want RUDE BOY Clash Film".<ref>[[#CITEREFGray2005|Gray 2005]], p.334.

The Clash had planned to record and release a single every month in 1980. CBS balked at this idea, and the band came out with only one single—an original reggae tune, "[[Bankrobber]]", in August—before the December release of the 3-LP, 36-song ''[[Sandinista!]]'' The album again reflected a broad range of musical styles, including extended [[dub music|dubs]] and one of the first forays into [[Hip hop music|rap]] by a major rock band, following "Ant Rap" by Adam and the Ants, which had been released a month earlier. Produced by the band members with the participation of Jamaican reggae artist [[Mikey Dread]], ''Sandinista!'' was their most controversial album to date, both politically and musically.<ref>Jaffee, Larry (1987). ''The Politics of Rock'' (Popular Music and Society), pp. 19–30.</ref> Critical opinion was divided, often within individual reviews.

In 1981, the band came out with a single, "[[This Is Radio Clash]]", that further demonstrated their ability to mix diverse influences such as dub and hip hop. They set to work on their fifth album in September, originally planning it as a 2-LP set with the title ''Rat Patrol from Fort Bragg''. Jones produced one cut, but the other members were dissatisfied. Production duties were handed to [[Glyn Johns]], and the album was reconceived as a single LP, and released as ''[[Combat Rock]]'' in May 1982. Though filled with offbeat songs, experiments with [[sound collage]], and a spoken word vocal by [[Beat Generation|Beat]] poet [[Allen Ginsberg]], it contained two "radio friendly" tracks. The leadoff single in the US was "[[Should I Stay or Should I Go]]", released in June 1982. Another Jones feature in a rock and roll style similar to "Train in Vain", it received heavy airplay on [[Album-oriented rock|AOR]] stations. The follow-up, "[[Rock the Casbah]]", put lyrics addressing the Iranian clampdown on imports of Western music to a bouncy dance rhythm. (The singles were released in the opposite order in the UK, where they were both preceded by "[[Know Your Rights]]".) The music for "Rock the Casbah" was composed by Headon, who performed not only the percussion but also the piano and bass heard on the recorded version.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=380}} It was the band's biggest US hit ever, charting at number 8, and the video was put into heavy rotation by MTV. The album itself was the band's most successful, hitting number 2 in the UK and number 7 in the US.

===Disintegration and break up: 1982–1986===
After ''Combat Rock'', the Clash began to disintegrate. Headon was asked to leave the band just before the album's release because heroin addiction was damaging his health and drumming.{{sfn|Letts|2001|loc=1:07:11–1:08:09, 1:08:59–1:09:54.}}<ref name=Cromelin>{{cite journal|last=Cromelin |first=Richard |date=31 January 1988 |title=Strummer on Man, God, Law and the Clash |journal=Los Angeles Times |url=http://www.strummernews.com/latimes88.html |access-date=19 November 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020203022/http://strummernews.com/latimes88.html |archive-date=20 October 2007 }}</ref> Chimes was brought back to drum for the next few months. The loss of Headon, well-liked by the others, exposed growing friction within the band. Jones and Strummer began to feud. The band opened for [[the Who]] on a leg of their final tour in the US, including a show at New York's [[Shea Stadium]].

Though the Clash continued to tour, tension continued to increase. In early 1983, Chimes left the band after the Combat Rock Tour because of in-fighting and turmoil. He was replaced by Pete Howard for the [[US Festival]] in [[San Bernardino, California]], which the Clash co-headlined, along with [[David Bowie]] and [[Van Halen]]. The band argued with the event's promoters over inflated ticket prices, threatening to pull out unless a large donation was made to a local charity. The group ultimately performed on 28 May, the festival's New Music Day, which drew a crowd of 140,000. After the show, members of the band brawled with security staff.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=398}} This was Jones' last appearance with the group: in September 1983, he was fired. Shortly thereafter, he became a founding member of [[General Public]], but left that band as they were recording their first album.

[[Nick Sheppard]], formerly of the [[Bristol]]-based band [[The Cortinas (punk band)|the Cortinas]], and [[Vince White]] were recruited as the Clash's new guitarists. Howard continued as the drummer. The reconstituted band played its first shows in January 1984 with a batch of new material and launched into the self-financed Out of Control Tour, travelling widely over the winter and into early summer. At a striking miners' benefit show ("Scargill's Christmas Party") in December 1984, they announced that a new album would be released early in the new year.

The recording sessions for ''[[Cut the Crap]]'' were chaotic, with manager Bernard Rhodes and Strummer working in [[Munich, Germany|Munich]]. Most of the music was played by studio musicians, with Sheppard and later White flying in to provide guitar parts. Struggling with Rhodes for control of the band, Strummer returned home. The band went on a busking tour of public spaces in cities throughout the UK, playing acoustic versions of their hits and popular cover tunes.

After a concert in [[Athens, Greece|Athens]], Strummer went to Spain to clear his mind. While he was abroad, the first single from ''Cut the Crap'', the mournful "[[This Is England (song)|This Is England]]", was released to mostly negative reviews. "CBS had paid an advance for it so they had to put it out", Strummer later explained. "I just went, 'Well fuck this', and fucked off to the mountains of Spain to sit sobbing under a palm tree, while Bernie had to deliver a record."<ref name="joestrummer.us">{{cite web|url=http://www.joestrummer.us/?n9P81fmSnwwFUbhFAMuAAxe6bb31IUP&p=2&aOHDhtT57WPxn9Z7bWGQa3BBQbFVu17LfZSa&c=1&CxeQAdg5hVrrDtzOUCasLrnVGV7&XUZHs |title=Interview |work=Record Collector |year=2000 |access-date=5 December 2008 |publisher=Joe Strummer Resource |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005220200/http://www.joestrummer.us/?n9P81fmSnwwFUbhFAMuAAxe6bb31IUP&p=2&aOHDhtT57WPxn9Z7bWGQa3BBQbFVu17LfZSa&c=1&CxeQAdg5hVrrDtzOUCasLrnVGV7&XUZHs |archive-date=5 October 2011 }}</ref> However, critic Dave Marsh later championed "This Is England" as one of the top 1001 rock singles of all time.<ref>Marsh, Dave (1989). ''The Heart of Rock & Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made'' (Penguin), pp. 77–80. {{ISBN|0-14-012108-0}}.</ref> The single has also received retroactive praise from [[Q (magazine)|''Q'' magazine]] and others.

"This Is England", much like the rest of the album that came out later that year, had been drastically re-engineered by Rhodes, with synths and football-style chants added to Strummer's incomplete recordings. Although Howard was an adept drummer, drum machines were used for virtually all of the percussion tracks. For the remainder of his life, Strummer largely disowned the album,<ref name=Cromelin/> although he did profess that "I really like 'This Is England' and [album track] 'North and South' is a vibe."<ref name="joestrummer.us"/> In early 1986, the Clash disbanded. Strummer later described the group's end: "When the Clash collapsed, we were tired. There had been a lot of intense activity in five years. Secondly, I felt we'd run out of idea gasoline. And thirdly, I wanted to shut up and let someone else have a go at it."{{sfn|Johnstone|2006|p=104}}

This period of disintegration, featuring interviews with members of the Clash, is the subject matter of Danny Garcia's book and film, ''The Rise and Fall of the Clash''.<ref name="The Rise and Fall of The Clash">author= Danny Garcia publisher= Thin Man Press, London. ASIN 956247326.</ref>

===Collaborations, reunions and Strummer's death: 1986–present===
After the break-up, Strummer contacted Jones in an effort to reform the Clash. Jones, however, had already formed a new band, [[Big Audio Dynamite]] (B.A.D.), that had released its debut late in 1985. The two did work together on their respective 1986 projects. Jones helped out with the two songs Strummer wrote and performed for the ''[[Sid and Nancy]]'' soundtrack. Strummer, in turn, cowrote a number of the tracks on the second B.A.D. album, ''[[No.&nbsp;10, Upping St.]]'', which he also co-produced.<ref name="joestrummer.us"/> With Jones committed to B.A.D., Strummer moved on to various solo projects and screen acting work. Simonon formed a band called [[Havana 3am]]. Headon recorded a [[Waking Up (Topper Headon album)|solo album]], before once again spiraling into drug abuse. Chimes drummed with a succession of different acts.

On 2 March 1991, a reissue of "Should I Stay or Should I Go" gave the Clash its first and only number 1 UK single. That same year, Strummer reportedly cried when he learned that "Rock the Casbah" had been adopted as a slogan by US bomber pilots in the [[Gulf War]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/strummer.html|title=Revolution Rock: Documentary Pays Tribute to Clash Frontman Joe Strummer|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=1 February 2008|access-date=13 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313094918/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/strummer.html <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archive-date=13 March 2008}}</ref>

In 1999, Strummer, Jones and Simonon cooperated in compiling of the live album ''[[From Here to Eternity: Live|From Here to Eternity]]'' and video documentary ''[[The Clash: Westway to the World|Westway to the World]]''. On 7 November 2002, the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] announced that the Clash would be inducted the following March.<ref>{{cite web

Simonon did not want to participate because he believed that playing at the high-priced event would not have been in the spirit of the Clash. Strummer's sudden death from a congenital heart defect on 22 December 2002 ended any possibility of a full reunion. In March 2003, the Hall of Fame induction took place; the band members inducted were Strummer, Jones, Simonon, Chimes and Headon.<ref name="rockhall-The_Clash" />

In early 2008, [[Carbon/Silicon]], a new band founded by Mick Jones and his former London SS bandmate [[Tony James (musician)|Tony James]], entered into a six-week residency at London's Inn on the Green. On opening night, 11 January, Headon joined the band for the Clash's "Train in Vain". An encore followed with Headon playing drums on "Should I Stay or Should I Go". This was the first time since 1982 that Headon and Jones had performed together on stage.<ref>{{cite web

In July 2012, Strummer's daughters, Jazz and Lola, gave a rare interview to discuss the upcoming tenth anniversary of their father's passing, his legacy and the possibility of a Clash reunion had their father lived. Jazz said "There was talk about the Clash reforming before he died. But there had been talk for years and years about them reforming. They had been offered stupid amounts of money to do it, but they were very good at keeping the moral high ground and saying no. But I think if Dad hadn't died, it would have happened. It felt like it was in the air."<ref>{{cite news|author=Lena Corner |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/28/joe-strummer-daughters-jazz-lola |title=Our dad, Joe Strummer, remembered &#124; Life and style |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=1 September 2013 |location=London |date=28 July 2012}}</ref>

On 9 September 2013 in the UK (and a day later in the US), the Clash released ''[[Sound System (album)|Sound System]]'', a twelve-disc box set featuring their studio albums completely re-mastered on eight discs with an additional three discs featuring demos, non-album singles, rarities and B-sides, a DVD with previously unseen footage by both [[Don Letts]] and Julien Temple, original promo videos and live footage, an owner's manual booklet, reprints of the band's original 'Armagideon Times' fanzine as well as a brand new edition curated and designed by Paul Simonon and merchandise including dog tags, badges, stickers and an exclusive Clash poster. Both Mick Jones and Paul Simonon oversaw the project including the re-masters. The box set came in a package shaped as an 80s [[ghetto blaster]]. The box set was accompanied by ''[[5 Album Studio Set]]'', which contains only the first five studio albums (excluding ''[[Cut the Crap]]''), and ''[[The Clash Hits Back]]'', a 33-track, two-CD best of collection sequenced to copy the set played by the band at the Brixton Fair Deal (now the Academy) on 19 July 1982.<ref>{{cite news|author=Michael Hann |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/21/the-clash-box-set-remastered-albums-rarities |title=The Clash to release new box set of remastered albums and rarities &#124; Music |work=theguardian.com |access-date=1 September 2013 |location=London |date=21 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sound-System-The-Clash/dp/B008U3NU38/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1369126674&sr=8-1&keywords=the+clash+sound+system |title=Sound System: Music |website=Amazon |date=25 May 2013 |access-date=1 September 2013}}</ref>

In a 3 September 2013 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Mick Jones discussed the band reuniting saying it likely would have never happened. Jones said "There were a few moments at the time I was up for it (Hall of Fame reunion in 2003), Joe was up for it. Paul wasn't. And neither, probably, was Topper, who didn't wind up even coming in the end. It didn't look like a performance was going to happen anyway. I mean, you usually play at that ceremony when you get in. Joe had passed by that point, so we didn't. We were never in agreement. It was never at a point where all of us wanted to do it at the same time. Most importantly for us, we became friends again after the group broke up, and continued that way for the rest of the time. That was more important to us than the band". Jones also stated that the ''Sound System'' box set was the last time he will ever be involved in the band's releases. "I'm not even thinking about any more Clash releases. This is it for me, and I say that with an exclamation mark." Jones said.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Andy Greene |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-clashs-mick-jones-this-is-it-for-me-20130830 |title=Mick Jones on Clash Box Set &#124; Music News |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=30 August 2013 |access-date=17 April 2014}}</ref>

In an October 2013 interview with BBC 6Music, Jones confirmed that Strummer did have intentions of a Clash reunion and in fact new music was being written for a possible album. In the months prior to Strummer's death, Jones and Strummer began working on new music for what he thought would be the next Mescaleros album. Jones said "We wrote a batch – we didn't use to write one, we used to write a batch at a time – like gumbo. The idea was he was going to go into the studio with the Mescaleros during the day and then send them all home. I'd come in all night and we'd all work all night." Jones said months had passed following their work together when he ran into Strummer at an event. Jones was curious as to what would become of the songs he and Strummer were working on and Strummer informed him that they were going to be used for the next Clash album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/story/mick-jones-secret-strummer-tunes-could-have-sparked-the-clash-s-comeback_3892188 |title=The Clash – Mick Jones: 'Secret Joe Strummer Tunes Could Have Sparked The Clash's Comeback'|publisher=Contact Music|access-date=4 October 2013|date=4 October 2013}}</ref>

 | quote  = The moment that best exemplifies the Clash&nbsp;... took place in August 1977, at a music festival in Liege, Belgium. The band was playing before 20,000 people and had been under fire from a crowd that was throwing bottles at the stage. But that wasn't what bothered lead singer Joe Strummer. What enraged him was a 10-foot-high barbed-wire fence strung between concrete posts and forming a barrier between the group and the audience&nbsp;... [He] jumped from the stage and attacked the fence, trying to pull it down&nbsp;... The Clash were the only performers at the show who tried to do anything about the obstacle. They were more willing to run the risk of the crowd than to tolerate barbed wire that was meant to fend off that crowd. This is more or less what the Clash were about: fighting the good fight that few others would fight.<ref name="Gilmore"/>

Their politics were made explicit in the lyrics of such early recordings as "White Riot", which encouraged disaffected white youths to riot like their black counterparts; "[[Career Opportunities (song)|Career Opportunities]]", which addressed the alienation of low-paid, routinised jobs and discontent over the lack of alternatives; and "London's Burning", about the bleakness and boredom of life in the inner city.<ref>Gray (2004), pp. 145–146, 158–159, 169–171.</ref> Artist [[Caroline Coon]], who was associated with the punk scene, argued that "[t]hose tough, militaristic songs were what we needed as we went into [[Thatcherism]]".{{sfn|Gilbert|2005|p=190}} The scope of the band's political interests widened on later recordings.

The title of ''Sandinista!'' celebrated the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|left-wing rebels]] who had recently overthrown Nicaraguan despot [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]], and the album was filled with songs driven by other political issues extending far beyond British shores: "[[Washington Bullets (song)|Washington Bullets]]" addressed covert military operations around the globe, while "The Call-Up" was a meditation on US draft policies.<ref>Gray (2004), pp. 355–356</ref>{{sfn|Reynolds|Press|1996|p=72}} ''Combat Rock''{{'}}s "[[Straight to Hell (The Clash song)|Straight to Hell]]" is described by scholars [[Simon Reynolds]] and Joy Press as an "around-the-world-at-war-in-five-verses guided tour of hell-zones where boy-soldiers had languished."{{sfn|Reynolds|Press|1996|p=72}}

The band's political sentiments were reflected in their resistance to the music industry's usual profit motivations; even at their peak, tickets to shows and souvenirs were reasonably priced.<ref name="RS198004-The_Clash" /> The group insisted that CBS sell their double and triple album sets ''London Calling'' and ''Sandinista!'' for the price of a single album each (then £5), succeeding with the former and compromising with the latter by agreeing to sell it for £5.99 and forfeit all their performance royalties on its first 200,000 sales.<ref>Gray (2004), p. 349.</ref> These "VFM" (value for money) principles meant that they were constantly in debt to CBS, and only started to break even around 1982.<ref name="bbcco-Strummer_dies" />

[[Jake Burns]] of [[Stiff Little Fingers]], the first major punk band from [[Northern Ireland]], explained the record's impact:
<blockquote>
[T]he big watershed was the Clash album—that was go out, cut your hair, stop mucking about time, y'know. Up to that point we'd still been singing about bowling down California highways. I mean, it meant nothing to me. Although the Damned and the Pistols were great, they were only exciting musically; lyrically, I couldn't really make out a lot if it&nbsp;... [T]o realise that [the Clash] were actually singing about their own lives in West London was like a bolt out of the blue.{{sfn|Strongman|2008|pp=188–189}}
</blockquote>
The Clash also inspired many musicians who were only loosely associated, if at all, with punk. The band's embrace of ska, reggae and England's Jamaican subculture helped provide the impetus for the [[2 Tone (music genre)|2 Tone]] movement that emerged amid the fallout of the punk explosion.{{sfn|D'Ambrosio|2004|p=298}} Other musicians who began performing while the Clash were active and acknowledged their debt to the band include [[Billy Bragg]] and [[Aztec Camera]].<ref>{{cite news| author = Gray, Chris| title = Fans Mourn Passing of the Political Man of Punk| work = The Independent| location = UK| date = 24 December 2002| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/fans-mourn-passing-of-the-political-man-of-punk-611922.html| access-date = 28 August 2009| archive-date = 26 November 2010| archive-url = http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20101126031807/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/fans-mourn-passing-of-the-political-man-of-punk-611922.html| url-status = dead}}</ref> [[U2]]'s [[the Edge]] has compared the Clash's inspirational effect to that of the [[Ramones]]—both gave young rock musicians at large the "sense that the door of possibility had swung open."<ref>Stockman, Steve (2005).
