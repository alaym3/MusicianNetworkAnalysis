'''Vocal Few''' are an American [[folk pop]] husband and wife duo, consisting of Matt and Kristie MacDonald, from [[Seattle]], Washington. Vocal Few, a side project to Matt MacDonald's band, The Classic Crime, began as a 'pre-baby bucket list' item for the couple before the birth of their first daughter, Praise MacDonald. Their first EP, ''She'll Be Right'', was released in January 2012, one month after Praise was born. Their second EP, Tall Trees, was released in May 2013 shortly after finding out they were pregnant with their second daughter, Piper MacDonald. Their love for making music together expanded beyond the inspiration of their offspring – their third EP, titled ''The Dream Alive'' was released on October 30, 2015 with no new babies on the way. Their most recent release is a collection of original winter songs aptly named 'The Snowdrift EP', which was released on November 30, 2016.
