==Music career==

===Immigration to Germany===
Najafi was head of an underground music band in [[Iran]] before his immigration to Germany, but he was banned for his offenses towards the Islamic faith in Iran by the [[Iranian government]] after his second music show.<ref name="bbc.1.3"/> He was also the head of the Inan music band in Germany. Then he joined the Tapesh 2012 music band.<ref name="r.farda.1.1">{{cite web |title=Protest of music to the patriarchal society of Iran |url=http://www.radiofarda.com/Article/2008/05/11/f4_Tapesh_band_music_.html |work=RFE/RL |publisher=[[Radio Farda]] }}</ref> Tapesh 2012 were welcomed by Persian broadcasters and the international media by political and social songs and poems of Najafi.<ref name="dw.1.2">{{cite web |title=Music Festival Bochum Total and presence and performance of 'Tapesh 2012' music band |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4863077,00.html |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711125132/http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0%2C%2C4863077%2C00.html |archivedate=11 July 2010}}</ref>

An article published in No. 19194 of the conservative newspaper ''[[Kayhan]]'' on 29 September 2008 criticized Tapesh 2012's activities. ''Kayhan'' published the article titled ''Establishing democracy with drum & circle''. A part of it goes as follows:

{{quote|Recently, opponents of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]] continue their goals in universities and in the form of music groups to make known the autocracies of the Iranian government. Recently some blogs of opposition students have published a statement about "Tapesh 2012" which gives news Establishing [[One Million Signatures]] by "Tapesh 2012". This group is composed of some iranian and german that are not affiliated with any party or group. The purpose of this group is attempting to collect signatures and present it on the anniversary of Human rights (10 December) to [[Parliament of Europe]] in Brussels. They have attracted world media attention to inappropriate conditions in Iran and dissatisfaction of Iranian people. The [[Parliament of Europe]] announced the official support for the group plans. They encourage people to consider how the regime suppresses human rights.<ref name="kei.1.1">{{cite web |title=Establishing democracy with drum & circle: "Tapesh 2012" |url=http://kayhannews.ir/870708/6.htm#other604 |work=Daily newspaper|publisher=[[Kayhan]] }}</ref>}}

===Release of first studio album===
On 1 May 2008, Najafi released his first studio album, ''Ma mard nistim'' (We Are Not Men), with partnership and composition of the Tapesh 2012 music band. This album was his official and professional beginning in [[Persian hip hop]] music. The album attracted the audience and listener more than any album before it was released in [[Persian hip hop]] style.<ref name="dw.1.3">{{cite web |title=The success of 'We Are Not Men' |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3311081,00.html |work=International public broadcaster |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] }}</ref>

===Separation from Tapesh 2012===
Najafi ended cooperation with Tapesh 2012 from the beginning of 2009. A variety of reasons have been proposed related to his separation from this group. The main reason is releasing the "Around us" single song in [[Voice of America]] TV without permission. The supervisor of Tapesh 2012 later apologised to Najafi and stated: the song has been inadvertently released in [[Voice of America]] TV. Najafi accepted the apology.<ref>{{cite web |title=Separation from Tapesh 2012 |url=http://sharr.blogfa.com/post-108.aspx |publisher=Shahin Najafi }}</ref>

===Reaction to the 2009 Iranian presidential election===
After the [[2009–2010 Iranian election protests|Iranian election protests]], Najafi released a single named ''Neda'' in July 2009 dedicated to [[Neda Agha-Soltan]], an activist killed during the protests.<ref>{{cite web |title=a memorial for Neda Agha-Soltan |url=http://www.sharr.blogfa.com/post-132.aspx |publisher=Shahin Najafi }}</ref> He released his second studio album titled ''[[Illusion (Shahin Najafi album)|Tavahhom]]'' (Illusion) on 19 September 2009 by the German-Iranian publishing house "Pamas-Verlag". In this album, several songs are about the intense protests against the [[Iranian government]] and the political oppression that occurred after the presidential election.<ref name="shah.4.3">{{cite web |title=more about Illusion |url=http://www.sharr.blogfa.com/post-146.aspx |publisher=Shahin Najafi }}</ref><ref name="shah.4.4">{{cite web |title=more about Illusion(2)|url=http://www.sharr.blogfa.com/post-147.aspx |publisher=Shahin Najafi }}</ref>
Can be cited to "Vaghti khoda khabe (When God is asleep)" through these songs. The song's lyrics protest the [[2009 Iran poll protests trial]], militia violence, the use of torture on prisoners and the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]].

===Formation of Antikarisma===
He formed a new rock band as '''Antikarisma''' band in January 2010. The new band, Antikarisma, consists of Najafi, Babak Khazaei, Armin Mostaed, and Pejman Afshari, who live in Germany.<ref>{{cite web |title=Shahin najafi and Antikarisma band |url=http://www.zirzamin.org/?q=node/871 |date=10 February 2010 |work=Zir Zamin-Iranian alternative music magazine |publisher=Ferri Tafreshi |accessdate=10 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303102228/http://www.zirzamin.org/?q=node%2F871 |archivedate=3 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Shahin Najafi and Antikarisma – Voices of Change – Persian Hip hop Festival in Sweden |url=http://www.zirzamin.org/?q=node/878 |date=10 February 2010 |work=Zir Zamin-Iranian alternative music magazine |publisher=Ferri Tafreshi |accessdate=10 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308085551/http://www.zirzamin.org/?q=node%2F878 |archivedate=8 March 2010}}</ref>
