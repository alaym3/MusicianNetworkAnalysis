==History==
===Early history (''Uprooted'' and ''In The Attic of the Universe'' 2006-2007)===
{{Main|Uprooted (The Antlers album)|In the Attic of the Universe}}
Initially, The Antlers was the solo project of vocalist and guitarist Peter Silberman, who started recording solo concept albums in 2003. Silberman eventually renamed the project to The Antlers shortly after moving to [[Brooklyn]], New York City in late 2005.<ref name="pinklipiview">[http://pinklippariah.blogspot.com/2009/06/antlers-peter-silberman.html "Interview with Peter Silberman"] Retrieved on 2009-07-04. {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120630151951/http://pinklippariah.blogspot.com/2009/06/antlers-peter-silberman.html |date=2012-06-30 }}</ref> Silberman's first album, ''[[Uprooted (The Antlers album)|Uprooted]]'', contained nine songs which he wrote and recorded himself. It was self-released in October 2006. The follow-up album ''[[In the Attic of the Universe]]'' was also written and recorded by Silberman. It was released for free online in March 2007 and also received a CD release in November 2007 on [[Fall Records]].

===''Cold War'' and ''New York Hospitals'' (2007)===
After the release of ''In the Attic of the Universe'', Silberman recorded two EP's entitled ''Cold War'' and ''New York Hospitals'', the latter featuring Michael Lerner and [[Sharon Van Etten]] as guests. Shortly thereafter, Michael Lerner and Darby Cicci came on board transforming The Antlers into a collaborative group.

===''Hospice'' (2009)===
{{Main|Hospice (The Antlers album)}}
The Antlers’ third full-length album, ''[[Hospice (The Antlers album)|Hospice]]'', marked the beginning of the project's shift from Silberman's solo project into its full-band incarnation, featuring significant contributions from Lerner and Cicci, as well as guest vocals by [[Sharon Van Etten]].<ref>{{cite web|title='Hospice' by The Antlers – An Album Review|url=http://helicopterseeds.com/2009/04/04/hospice-by-the-antlers-an-album-review/|website=Helicopter Seeds|accessdate=2009-07-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804100730/http://helicopterseeds.com/2009/04/04/hospice-by-the-antlers-an-album-review/|archivedate=2009-08-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> The band self-released the album in March 2009, selling out all of the quantities in stock.

This 4 song EP has been described by the band as an imitation of "the serenity of drifting off to sleep or sinking to the bottom of the ocean."<ref>{{cite web|author=Gina Cargas |url=http://prettymuchamazing.com/reviews/antlers-undersea |title=Review: The Antlers - Undersea « PMA |publisher=Pretty Much Amazing |date=2012-07-30 |accessdate=2014-07-13}}</ref> The record received widespread critical acclaim, with [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] stating that the band's "mutually reliant interplay has never been stronger than it is here."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16860-undersea/ |title=The Antlers: Undersea &#124; Album Reviews |website=Pitchfork |date=2012-07-26 |accessdate=2014-07-13}}</ref> Darby Cicci designed the artwork for the EP.

===''Familiars'' (2014)===
{{Main|Familiars (album)}}
The band's fifth full-length studio album entitled ''[[Familiars (album)|Familiars]]'' was released on June 17, 2014 via [[ANTI-]] in the U.S. and [[Transgressive Records|Transgressive]] in the U.K./Europe. The album was recorded and produced by the band in their Brooklyn based studio, and mixed by Chris Coady. On March 31, 2014, after releasing a cryptic video teaser the week prior, the band announced the release of the nine-track album along with a music video to the album's first single "Palace".  The video was directed by Hana Tajima. Darby Cicci designed the artwork for the album.

''Familiars'' received rave reviews from publications such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', who commented that "''Familiars'' finds the Antlers on a new, magnificent level of heavy songwriting."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ayers|first1=Mike|title=The Antlers Familiars Album|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/familiars-20140617|website=Rolling Stone}}</ref> Many critics alluded to the growth of The Antler's artistic approach on the album. [[Mojo (magazine)|MOJO]] called the work "another existentially-minded beauty...turning agony into something approaching ecstasy." [[Loud and Quiet]] commented on the record's success: "Slow-burning, poised and richly beautiful... The Antlers have been responsible for a handful of the most soul-shifting moments in guitar-based indie rock over the last few years, and this should see the band cement their place in the genre's upper echelons."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Watkeys|first1=Chris|title=Familiars by The Antlers|url=http://www.loudandquiet.com/2014/06/familiars-by-the-antlers/|website=LOUD AND QUIET|access-date=2014-07-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728052748/http://www.loudandquiet.com/2014/06/familiars-by-the-antlers/|archive-date=2014-07-28|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Hiatus (2015–2019)===
Shortly after the release of ''Familiars'', Silberman experienced hearing loss. He was unsure he could continue making music, and left Brooklyn in 2015 to a cabin in [[upstate New York]] to record a solo album, entitled ''Impermanence'', which was released in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Brodsky |first=Rachel |date=February 24, 2017 |title=How Peter Silberman Lost His Hearing, Then Rediscovered Sound |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/music/peter-silberman/how-peter-silberman-lost-his-hearing-and-rediscove/ |access-date=October 1, 2021 |website=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]}}</ref> The Antlers went on a hiatus.
