== Influence ==
The project has described its own work as a focus on the surreal qualities of [[vaporwave]] rather than a 1980s or 1990s aesthetic. In the group's interview with Rolling Stone, HKE said when describing ''Birth of a New Day'', "We wanted to show how the whole vaporwave vibe could be made as original music rather than just relying on the same [[Elevator Music|muzak]] and kitsch-pop samples everyone else had been using for years..." Not Not Fun Records boss Brit Brown called the album "amazing cyberfuture ambient vaporwave," while Vice called the duo "vaporwave superstars."<ref name=":02">{{Cite web|title=Prepare to Get Deliriously Dreamy with Vaporwave Sensation 2814's "Shinjitsu no Koi"|url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/qkann5/prepare-to-get-deliriously-dreamy-with-vaporwave-sensation-2814s-shinjitsu-no-koi|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vice.com|language=en}}</ref>

Their later album, ''[[Rain Temple]]'', was described by HKE as "intense, dramatic and cinematic" and as containing elements of [[spirituality]].<ref name=":neon">{{Cite web|url=https://www.neondystopia.com/cyberpunk-music/vapour-dreams-an-interview-with-hke-of-dream-catalogue-and-2814/|title=Vapour Dreams: An interview with HKE of Dream Catalogue and 2814|website=Neon Dystopia|access-date=2016-11-02}}</ref>

== Reception ==
As of 2015, its albums were often staples of the [[Bandcamp]] charts.<ref name=":1" /> Their LP Birth of a New Day managed to gain much praise from critics,<ref name=":02" /><ref name=":12">{{Cite web|date=2015-11-25|title=10 New Artists You Need to Know: November 2015|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/10-new-artists-you-need-to-know-november-2015-147133/|access-date=2020-11-03|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref> while maintaining a cult following from internet users.
