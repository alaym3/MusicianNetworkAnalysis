He is the founder of the [[record label]] [[No Limit Records]], which was relaunched as [[New No Limit Records]] through [[Universal Records (defunct record label)|Universal Records]] and [[Koch Records]], and again as [[Guttar Music Entertainment]], and currently, [[No Limit Forever Records]]. He is also the founder and [[CEO]] of P. Miller Enterprises and Better Black Television, which was a short-lived online television network. Miller initially gained fame in the mid-1990s with the success of his [[hip hop music|hip hop]] group [[TRU (group)|TRU]] as well as his fifth solo rap album ''[[Ice Cream Man (album)|Ice Cream Man]]'', which contained his first [[Single (music)|single]] "[[Mr. Ice Cream Man]]". Miller gained further popularity in 1997 after the success of his [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] single "[[Make 'Em Say Uhh!]]". In total, Miller has released 15 studio albums.

Percy Robert Miller was born and raised in [[New Orleans]] in the [[Calliope Projects]]. He is the oldest of five children. He has one sister, Germaine and three brothers: Kevin and platinum-selling rap artists Corey "[[C-Murder]]" and Vyshonne "[[Silkk the Shocker]]" Miller. He attended [[Booker T. Washington High School (Shreveport, Louisiana)|Booker T.

On February 15, 1990, Master P released the cassette tape ''Mind Of A Psychopath''. His brother Kevin Miller was killed that same year in New Orleans. This increased his motivation to become a successful entrepreneur to change his life and save his family.<ref name="Biography.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/print/profile/master-p-597332|title=Master P|publisher=A&E Networks|website=Biography.com|access-date=August 20, 2013}}</ref>

== Music career ==
=== Early works ===
Master P released his debut studio album ''[[Get Away Clean]]'' on February 12, 1991. This was followed by his second album ''[[Mama's Bad Boy]]'', which was released in April 1992. Both albums were released through In-A-Minute Records. In 1993, Master P released his first collaboration album with his group [[TRU (group)|TRU]] titled ''[[Who's da Killer?]]'' Master P released his third studio album ''[[The Ghettos Tryin to Kill Me!]]'' on March 18, 1994; it was later re-released in 1997 as a limited edition under [[Priority Records|Priority]]. That same year Master P collaborated on the No Limit compilation albums ''[[West Coast Bad Boyz, Vol. 1: Anotha Level of the Game]]'' and ''[[West Coast Bad Boyz: High fo Xmas]]''. On June 6, 1995, Master P released his fourth studio album ''[[99 Ways to Die (album)|99 Ways to Die]]''. Master P and TRU released their third album ''[[True (TRU album)|True]]'' in 1995, which was the group's first major release after two independent albums. The album reached number 25 on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] and number 14 on the [[Top Heatseekers]]. The album was known for its first single and one of Master P's best known songs "I'm Bout' It, Bout It". He also worked on the compilation album, ''[[Down South Hustlers: Bouncin' and Swingin']]'', during that year.

Master P said that when he used to open for [[Tupac Shakur]] in the early 1990s, the people responsible for introducing him would frequently call him "Mr. P the country singer".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2018/12/master-p-interview-stories-from-his-iconic-career-from-2pac-to-solange|title=From 2Pac to Solange: Master P Shares Stories From His Iconic Career|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=December 17, 2018}}</ref>

=== 1995–2000: Return to New Orleans and mainstream success ===
In 1995, Master P moved from California back to [[New Orleans]] to relocate No Limit Records with a set of new artists and in-house producers [[Beats By the Pound]]. On April 16, 1996, Master P released his fifth album ''[[Ice Cream Man (album)|Ice Cream Man]]''. It contained the hit single "[[Mr. Ice Cream Man]]". Later in 1996, Master P returned with TRU to work on ''[[Tru 2 da Game]]'', which would not be released until February 18, 1997. At that time, TRU was reduced to a trio with just Master P alongside his brothers [[C-Murder]] and [[Silkk the Shocker]]. On September 2, 1997, Master P released his breakthrough album ''[[Ghetto D]]''. The first week sales of the album were the highest of any of Master P's albums, selling over 760,000 copies, and it went on to go certified triple platinum. It contained the hit single "[[Make 'Em Say Uhh!]]", Master P's highest-charting single to date. The song earned him an [[MTV Video Music Award]] nomination the following year for "Best Rap Video", but lost to [[Will Smith]]'s "[[Gettin' Jiggy Wit It]]". On June 2, 1998, Master P released his seventh and best-selling album to date ''[[MP Da Last Don]]''. Master P released a film of the same name earlier that year. The album debuted at number 1 on the Billboard Top 200 charts selling over 400,000 copies in its first week, and went on to sell over four million copies. On October 26, 1999, Master P released his eighth studio album ''[[Only God Can Judge Me]]'', which contained his single "Step To Dis". The album went certified gold, selling over 500,000 copies. In 1999, Master P and TRU released their fifth studio album ''[[Da Crime Family]]''. On November 28, 2000, he released his ninth studio album ''[[Ghetto Postage]]'' which contained his hit singles "Bout Dat" and "Souljas". Also in 2000, Master P and his new group [[504 Boyz]] released their debut album ''[[Goodfellas (504 Boyz album)|Goodfellas]]'', which peaked at number 1 on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] and contained their hit single "[[Wobble Wobble]]".

=== 2001–2005: The New No Limit ===
On December 18, 2001, Master P released his tenth studio album ''[[Game Face]]'', the first Master P album released on The New No Limit, which had a partnership with [[Universal Records (defunct record label)|Universal Records]]. In 2002, The [[504 Boyz]] released their second album [[Ballers (album)|Ballers]]. Both albums charted high on the Hip-Hop charts, but shortly after, No Limit began to decline in popularity. Record sales as well as roster changes and lawsuits caused No Limit Records to file for bankruptcy on December 17, 2003.

Master P's eleventh album, titled ''[[Good Side, Bad Side (Master P album)|Good Side, Bad Side]]'', was released on March 23, 2004, through Koch Records, debuting at number 1 on the ''Billboard'' [[Independent Albums]] chart. Master P and TRU released their last album ''[[The Truth (TRU album)|The Truth]]'' in 2005 followed by Master P's twelfth studio album ''[[Ghetto Bill]]'' Vol. 1.

=== 2005–2007: Guttar Music ===
In 2005, Master P and his son [[Romeo Miller]] formed the independent label [[Guttar Music]]. On November 29, 2005, Master P released his first independent album and thirteenth overall, ''[[Living Legend: Certified D-Boy]]'', on Guttar Music. Master P and [[504 Boyz]] released their last album titled ''[[Hurricane Katrina: We Gon Bounce Back]]'' that year, and it was dedicated to the victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]].

In April 2006, Master P released a compilation album ''[[America's Most Luved Bad Guy]]''. In 2007, Master P released a collaboration album with Romeo titled ''[[Hip Hop History]]'' that sold 32,000 copies worldwide.

== Business career ==
Aside from being a rapper, Master P has enjoyed a successful career as an entrepreneur and investor. Miller opened a record store in [[Richmond, California]] called [[No Limit Records]], which later became the foundation for his own record label of the same name.<ref>[https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Rap-s-Master-P-Has-a-Master-Plan-Media-rejects-2824304.php Master P plan] Retrieved April 23, 2021</ref>

Miller was one of the first rappers to notice and take advantage of the retail potential of the music industry. As an investor, Master P was one of the first rappers to build a business and financial empire by investing in a wide range of business and investment ventures from a variety of industries. He has since invested the millions of dollars he made from his No Limit record company into a travel agency, a [[Foot Locker]] retail outlet, [[real estate]], stocks, film, music, and [[television production]], toy making, clothing, telecommunications, a jewellery line, auto accessories, book and magazine publishing, car rims, fast food franchises, and gas stations.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Master_P.aspx | title=Master P | publisher=Encyclopedia | access-date=February 18, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=Hip Hop Culture | author=Emmett George Price | pages=70}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.inquisitr.com/2791359/how-is-master-ps-net-worth-still-ranked-as-one-of-raps-top-5-highest-paid/ | title=How Is Master P's Net Worth Still Ranked As One Of Rap's Top 5 Highest Paid? | publisher=Inquisitr | date=February 13, 2016 | access-date=February 18, 2016 | author=Antonio J.

Rappers had historically focused more on the artistic and glamorous side of hip hop music while paying very little attention to the business, investment and financial aspects. All that changed in 1996 when Master P signed a music distribution deal with Priority Records, one where No Limit Records would retain 100% ownership of their master recordings and keep 85% of their record's sales while giving Priority 15% in return for pressing and distribution which allows No Limit to profit from future sales such as catalogs and reissues.<ref name="Master P" /> Master P went on to make hundreds of millions of dollars from this deal. Additionally, Master P invented many innovative marketing techniques. According to Wendy Day, CEO of the Rap Coalition, "Master P had a whole marketing movement. He was the first person to market the way a corporate entity like IBM would market to their clientele." Whereas the traditional model for marketing records was to spend millions of dollars on expensive videos and air play, Miller did not have such a luxury. As an independent artist, Miller had to find a way to sell, market and build platinum record selling demand on a limited recording budget. He was known for keeping upfront business expenses down and [[profit margin]]s high. He began selling tapes out the trunk of his car in every city and town in America where there was potential demand for his music. He gave out free samples to people with expensive cars and had them playing his music throughout their neighborhoods. This street level [[guerrilla marketing]] technique set the foundation to build a larger fanbase for the future. After signing his deal with Priority, Miller began a high volume business model of cranking out as many records as possible, as frequently as possible. He branded all his albums, so that the No Limit brand became more important than the actual artist's name. Miller cross-promoted all his artists and albums inside the album covers. He also used [[Pen & Pixel|pen and pixel graphics]] and [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]]-inspired themes to make his albums stand out using Photoshop. He offered 20 songs per album, whereas most albums offered 15 or less, as Miller learned that customers wanted more for their money. He turned his artists into [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] [[comic book]]-like characters rather than just rappers. He made sure his artists were number one on [[Nielsen SoundScan|SoundScan]] every time they released an album, to build the perception of popularity. He used inexpensive videos to promote his artists and he cross-promoted albums using films and vice versa and tied them altogether as a package. Brand image and identity became more important than just music quality. Miller's record labels have sold 75 million records as a result of his innovative marketing and branding strategies.<ref name="NEIL STRAUSS" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/master-p-597332 | title=Master P – Biography | publisher=Biography.com | access-date=July 9, 2013}}</ref>

As founder and CEO of No Limit Entertainment, Miller at one time presided over a business empire that included his conglomerate No Limit Enterprises, [[No Limit Records]], Bout It Inc., No Limit Clothing, No Limit Communications, No Limit Films, No Limit Sports Management, P. M. Properties, and Advantage Travel. Miller represented former NFL running back [[Ricky Williams]] when he was drafted by the [[New Orleans Saints]]; however, the deal was rated the worst contract for a player in NFL History by [[ESPN]].<ref>{{Cite news| url = http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=contracts |title= The worst contracts in NFL history |author=Thomas Neumann|publisher=[[ESPN]] |date =February 19, 2009}}</ref> Miller manages the music, film, and television career of his son, rap star [[Romeo Miller]], as well as pop star Forrest Lipton and Atlanta rapper [[Gucci Mane]].
