==Military service==
Having been sponsored through university on an army bursary, Blunt was committed to serve a minimum of four years in the armed forces. He trained at the [[Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst]], in intake 963,<ref name="RS 07" /><ref name=commissioningGazette>{{London Gazette|issue=54899 |supp=y|page=10720|date=22 September 1997}}</ref> and was commissioned into the [[Life Guards (British Army)|Life Guards]], a reconnaissance regiment.

The Life Guards, part of the [[Household Cavalry Regiment]], were primarily based in [[Combermere Barracks]]. Blunt was trained in [[British Army Training Unit Suffield]] in Alberta, Canada, where his regiment was posted for six months in 1998 to act as the [[OPFOR|opposing army]] in combat training exercises.<ref name="Reg History">{{cite web | title = Household Cavalry, Brief regimental history | url =http://www.householdcavalry.info/hcr1992.htm | access-date =1 January 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070911122708/http://www.householdcavalry.info/hcr1992.htm |archive-date = 11 September 2007}}</ref>

In 1999, Blunt volunteered to join a [[Blues and Royals]] squadron deploying with [[NATO]] to Kosovo.<ref>{{cite web|title = NATO Occupies Tense Kosovo Capital|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/balkans/stories/kosovo061399.htm|website = [[The Washington Post]]|access-date = 6 December 2015|date = 13 June 1999|first = Michael|last = Dobbs}}</ref> Initially assigned to carry out reconnaissance of the [[North Macedonia]]–[[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] border, Blunt's [[troop]] worked ahead of the front lines, locating and targeting [[Serb]]ian forces for the [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO bombing campaign]].

During Blunt's Kosovo assignment he had brought along his guitar, strapped to the outside of his tank, and would sometimes perform for locals and troops.

Blunt left the British Army in 2002 so that he could pursue his musical career.<ref name="GW 2006"/> He started using the stage name "Blunt" in part to make it easier for others to spell; "Blount" is pronounced the same way, and remains his legal last name.<ref name = "RS Feb06">{{cite news|first=Austin|last=Scaggs|title=Q&A|work=Rolling Stone Magazine |publisher=Wenner Media LLC (Jann S.

===2003–2006: ''Back to Bedlam''===
{{Main|Back to Bedlam}}
[[File:James-Blunt2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Blunt performing in the United States, 2008]]
Blunt recorded ''[[Back to Bedlam]]'' in 2003 with Rothrock as producer in [[Conway Recording Studios]] and Rothrock's home studio in Los Angeles, playing many instruments himself.<ref name="PS Blunt"/><ref name="Album">{{cite journal |title=[[Back to Bedlam]] album liner notes|publisher=Atlantic Records|date=October 2004}}</ref> During recording, he lodged with actress [[Carrie Fisher]]. Fisher contributed in naming the album, and he recorded the song "[[Goodbye My Lover]]" in her bathroom.<ref name = "Telegraph"/> ''Back to Bedlam'' was released in the UK in October 2004.

Blunt's debut single in the UK was "[[High (James Blunt song)|High]]" (co-written with [[Ricky Ross (musician)|Ricky Ross]] of [[Deacon Blue]]). This song initially peaked below the Top 100 of the [[UK Singles Chart]], however after the subsequent success of "[[You're Beautiful]]" it made the Top 75 before being re-released.<ref name = "Billboard 2005">{{cite news |first= Margo |last=Whitmire |author2=Emmanuel Legrand |title=Blunt's Journey |work=[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] |publisher=Neilsen Business Media |page=31 |date= 17 September 2005 }}</ref> The song was chosen to appear in a [[Vodafone]] commercial in Italy, and was a Top 10 hit in that country.<ref name="Billboard 2007"/>

The debut album from the unknown Blunt initially attracted little critical attention; there were no published reviews from major UK music journals. His live performances, mainly in support of better-known musicians, received generally favourable reviews. His lack of performing experience and inconsistent approach with audiences was commented upon, while his music was likened to that of [[Damien Rice]] and [[David Gray (musician)|David Gray]].<ref name="Rescue Rooms">{{cite web |last=Allcock |first=Anthony |title=James Blunt at Rescue Rooms |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) |date=7 November 2004 | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/content/articles/2004/11/08/entertainment_music_event_reviews_2004_11_james_blunt_feature.shtml | access-date =10 February 2008}}</ref><ref name="93 Feet East">{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Mugan |title=James Blunt, 93 Feet East, London |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/james-blunt-93-feet-east-london-486079.html |work=The Independent |location=UK |publisher=[[Independent News & Media]] |date=10 January 2005 |access-date=10 February 2008 }}{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> In March 2004, with Blunt performing in the support role for [[Katie Melua]] in Manchester, Alex McCann of ''Designer Magazine'' wrote, "Blunt's ascendance is a dead cert and this time next year it isn't that far removed from reality to suggest that a number one album, Brit Award and countless accolade's <nowiki>[sic]</nowiki> will be his for the taking."<ref name="Lowry">{{cite web|last=McCann|first =Alex|title= Katie Melua/James Blunt – The Lowry, Manchester|work=Design Magazine|date=7 March 2004|url=http://designermagazine.tripod.com/KatieMeluaLIVEREV1.html|access-date =10 February 2008}}</ref> After the release of the album, concert support slots for [[Elton John]] and [[Lloyd Cole and the Commotions]] in late 2004 and early 2005 followed, as did a band residency at London club 93 Feet East.<ref name="tour">{{cite web|url=http://www.jamesblunt.co.uk/archives/tourdates.html|title= Tour Dates Archive|work=Jamesblunt.co.uk|access-date=31 December 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928120550/http://www.jamesblunt.co.uk/archives/tourdates.html |archive-date = 28 September 2007}}</ref> In March 2005, his second single, "[[Wisemen]]", was released.

"Goodbye My Lover" was released as the fourth UK single from the album in December 2005, and the second US single. The songs "High" and "Wisemen" were subsequently re-released in 2006.

In 2005, Blunt performed 90 live shows, mainly across the UK and Europe, and supported [[Jason Mraz]] in a North American tour. The "Back to Bedlam World Tour" started off in January 2006, covering cities in Europe, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, as well as three separate headline tours in North America, ending in November of that year.<ref name="tour"/> Not including promotional appearances, he performed over 140 live shows in 2006.

The videos for all of Blunt's singles from ''Back To Bedlam'' feature symbolism and dark imagery. In the first video for "High", he is buried in a desert. In the first video for "Wisemen", he is kidnapped and taken hostage. In the video for "You're Beautiful", he alludes to suicide by jumping off a cliff into the sea. In the "[[Goodbye My Lover]]" video, he is the outsider in a love triangle, imagining the couple, a man and woman (played by [[Matt Dallas]] of ''[[Kyle XY]]'' and [[Mischa Barton]] of ''[[The O.C.]]'') together. The re-release video for "High" features Blunt running in a forest. The re-release video for "Wisemen" has him burning identification papers, and then walking through a forest while he is on fire.

Blunt appeared on an episode of ''[[Sesame Street]]'' which aired on 14 November 2007, singing about triangles to the tune of "You're Beautiful".<ref name="LiveDaily">{{cite web|title=LiveDaily Interview: James Blunt |work=LiveDaily.com |publisher=[[IAC/InterActiveCorp|IAC]] |date=27 September 2007 |url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/12879.html |access-date=1 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027004249/http://www.livedaily.com/news/12879.html |archive-date=27 October 2008 }}</ref> A parody of "You're Beautiful" titled "[[You're Pitiful]]" was recorded by [[Weird Al Yankovic]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Stephen |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5482774 |title=Weird Al Yankovic |publisher=Npr.org |date=13 June 2006 |access-date=29 April 2012}}</ref> He gave personal permission for this parody to be included on a Weird Al album, but [[Atlantic Records]], his label, stepped in to forbid the commercial release of the song.

The first single from ''All the Lost Souls'', "1973", was inspired by Blunt's nights out at [[Pacha Group|Pacha]], an [[Ibiza]] club, which opened in that year.

Blunt collaborated twice during this album cycle. In late 2007, he worked with French rapper [[Sinik]].

On 14 November 2008, "[[Primavera in anticipo]]", [[Laura Pausini]]'s new album, was released. The title track is a duet with Blunt. The album reached the Number one in Italy.

Throughout 2007 and 2008, Blunt went on his second world tour, including a performance in London's [[The O2 (London)|O2 Arena]]. In July and August 2008, he supported [[Sheryl Crow]] on a 25-date tour along with [[Toots and the Maytals]].<ref>Laudadio, Marisa. "Sheryl Crow Preps for Life on the Road with Baby Wyatt".
