}}'''William Ford Gibson''' (born March 17, 1948) is an American-Canadian [[speculative fiction]] writer and [[essayist]] widely credited with pioneering the [[science fiction]] subgenre known as ''[[cyberpunk]]''. Beginning his writing career in the late 1970s, his early works were [[Noir fiction|noir]], near-future stories that explored the effects of [[technology]], [[cybernetics]], and [[computer network]]s on humans—a "combination of [[Low-life|lowlife]] and [[high tech]]"<ref name="mao2">{{cite book|title=Burning Chrome|title-link=Burning Chrome (short story collection)|last=Gibson|first=William|author2=Bruce Sterling|publisher=Harper Collins|year=1986|isbn=978-0-06-053982-5|location=New York|chapter=Introduction|oclc=51342671|author2-link=Bruce Sterling}}</ref>—and helped to create an [[iconography]] for the [[information age]] before the ubiquity of the Internet in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://blog.wired.com/defense/2008/05/pentagon-define.html|title=26 Years After Gibson, Pentagon Defines 'Cyberspace'|last=Schactman|first=Noah|date=May 23, 2008|journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|access-date=September 15, 2008|archive-date=September 14, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914151043/http://blog.wired.com/defense/2008/05/pentagon-define.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Gibson coined the term "[[cyberspace]]" for "widespread, interconnected digital technology" in his short story "[[Burning Chrome]]" (1982), and later popularized the concept in his acclaimed debut novel ''[[Neuromancer]]'' (1984). These early works of Gibson's have been credited with "renovating" science fiction literature in the 1980s.

After expanding on the story in ''Neuromancer'' with two more novels (''[[Count Zero]]'' in 1986, and ''[[Mona Lisa Overdrive]]'' in 1988), thus completing the [[dystopic]] [[Sprawl trilogy|''Sprawl'' trilogy]], Gibson collaborated with [[Bruce Sterling]] on the [[alternate history]] novel ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' (1990), which became an important work of the science fiction subgenre known as ''[[steampunk]]''.

In the 1990s, Gibson composed the [[Bridge trilogy|''Bridge'' trilogy]] of novels, which explored the [[sociological]] developments of near-future urban environments, [[postindustrial society]], and [[late capitalism]]. Following the turn of the century and the events of [[September 11 attacks|9/11]], Gibson emerged with a string of increasingly [[Literary realism|realist]] novels—''[[Pattern Recognition (novel)|Pattern Recognition]]'' (2003), ''[[Spook Country]]'' (2007), and ''[[Zero History]]'' (2010)—set in a roughly contemporary world. These works saw his name reach mainstream [[Bestseller|bestseller lists]] for the first time. His most recent novels, ''[[The Peripheral]]'' (2014) and [[Agency (novel)|''Agency'']] (2020), returned to a more overt engagement with technology and recognizable science fiction themes.

In 1999, ''[[The Guardian]]'' (UK) described Gibson as "probably the most important novelist of the past two decades", while the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' (Australia) called him the "noir prophet" of cyberpunk.<ref name="smh2">{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/books/a-reality-stranger-than-fiction/2007/09/06/1188783376158.html|title=A reality stranger than fiction|last=Bennie|first=Angela|date=September 7, 2007|website=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=Fairfax Media|access-date=January 21, 2008|archive-date=September 11, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911031016/http://www.smh.com.au/news/books/a-reality-stranger-than-fiction/2007/09/06/1188783376158.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Throughout his career, Gibson has written more than 20 short stories and 12 critically acclaimed novels (one in collaboration), contributed articles to several major publications, and collaborated extensively with performance artists, filmmakers, and musicians. His work has been cited as influencing a variety of disciplines: academia, design, film, literature, music, [[cyberculture]], and technology.

== Literary career ==
=== Early short fiction ===
{{details|Burning Chrome (short story collection)}}
Gibson's early writings are generally near-future stories about the influences of [[cybernetics]] and [[cyberspace]] (computer-simulated reality) technology on the human species. His themes of hi-tech [[shanty town]]s, recorded or broadcast stimulus (later to be developed into the "sim-stim" package featured so heavily in ''Neuromancer''), and dystopic intermingling of technology and humanity, are already evident in his first published short story, "Fragments of a Hologram Rose", in the Summer 1977 issue of ''[[Science fiction magazine#Defunct|Unearth]]''.<ref name="project cyberpunk interview"/><ref name=isfdb/> The latter thematic obsession was described by his friend and fellow author, Bruce Sterling, in the introduction of Gibson's short story collection ''[[Burning Chrome (short story collection)|Burning Chrome]]'', as "Gibson's classic one-two combination of lowlife and high tech."<ref name=mao>{{cite book |last=Gibson |first=William |author2=Bruce Sterling | chapter= Introduction | title=Burning Chrome |year=1986 |publisher=Harper Collins |location=New York |isbn=978-0-06-053982-5 |oclc = 51342671|title-link=Burning Chrome (short story collection) |author2-link=Bruce Sterling }}</ref>

Beginning in 1981,<ref name=isfdb/> Gibson's stories appeared in ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'' and ''Universe 11'', wherein his fiction developed a bleak, ''[[film noir]]'' feel. He consciously distanced himself as far as possible from the mainstream of science fiction (towards which he felt "an aesthetic revulsion", expressed in "[[The Gernsback Continuum]]"), to the extent that his highest goal was to become "a minor [[cult following|cult figure]], a sort of lesser [[J. G. Ballard|Ballard]]."<ref name="project cyberpunk interview"/> When Sterling started to distribute the stories, he found that "people were just genuinely baffled ... I mean they literally could not parse the guy's paragraphs ... the imaginative tropes he was inventing were just beyond people's grasp."<ref name="nomaps"/>

While [[Larry McCaffery]] has commented that these early short stories displayed flashes of Gibson's ability, science fiction critic [[Darko Suvin]] has identified them as "undoubtedly [cyberpunk's] best works", constituting the "furthest horizon" of the genre.<ref name="storming"/> The themes which Gibson developed in the stories, the Sprawl setting of "[[Burning Chrome]]" and the character of [[Molly Millions]] from "[[Johnny Mnemonic]]" ultimately culminated in his first novel, ''[[Neuromancer]]''.<ref name="storming"/>

The Sprawl trilogy was followed by the 1990 novel ''[[The Difference Engine]]'', an [[alternate history (fiction)|alternative history]] novel Gibson wrote in collaboration with [[Bruce Sterling]]. Set in a technologically advanced [[Victorian era]] Britain, the novel was a departure from the authors' cyberpunk roots. It was nominated for the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1991 and the [[John W. Campbell Memorial Award]] in 1992, and its success drew attention to the nascent [[steampunk]] literary genre of which it remains the best-known work.<ref name="steampunkt">{{cite news | first = Peter | last = Bebergal | title = The age of steampunk | url = https://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/08/26/the_age_of_steampunk/ | work = The Boston Globe | page = 3 | date = August 26, 2007 | access-date = October 14, 2007 | archive-date = September 4, 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070904001109/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/08/26/the_age_of_steampunk/ | url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/jan/07/steampunk-chiang-lake-macleod |work=[[The Guardian]] |title=Steampunk: the future of the past |first=Damien G |last=Walter |date=January 7, 2009 |access-date=January 11, 2009 |publisher=Guardian Media Group |location=London |archive-date=April 7, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190407094132/https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/jan/07/steampunk-chiang-lake-macleod |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Graphic novels===
In 2017, in between ''The Peripheral'' and ''Agency'', Gibson's comic/graphic novel ''[[Archangel (Gibson comic)|Archangel]]'' was published. Both ''Archangel'' and ''The Peripheral'' contain time travel (of sorts), but Gibson has clarified that the works are not related: "They're not "same universe".

=== Film adaptations, screenplays, and appearances ===
Gibson was first solicited to work as a screenwriter after a film producer discovered a waterlogged copy of ''Neuromancer'' on a beach at a [[Thailand|Thai]] resort.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[Details (magazine)|Details]] |url=http://www.textfiles.com/sf/cyberlit.txt |title=Cyber Lit |date=June 1992 |first=Gavin |last=Edwards |issue=134 |access-date=September 29, 2008 |archive-date=September 24, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924005406/http://www.textfiles.com/sf/cyberlit.txt |url-status=live }}</ref> His early efforts to write film scripts failed to manifest themselves as finished product; "Burning Chrome" (which was to be directed by [[Kathryn Bigelow]]) and "Neuro-Hotel" were two attempts by the author at film adaptations that were never made.<ref name="salza">{{cite interview |last=Gibson |first=William |title=William Gibson Interviewed by Giuseppe Salza |location=Cannes |date=May 1994 |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/235 |access-date=October 28, 2007 |archive-date=October 11, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011104756/http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/235 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the late 1980s he wrote an early version of ''[[Alien 3]]'' (which he later characterized as "[[Andrei Tarkovsky|Tarkovskian]]"), few elements of which survived in the final version.<ref name="salza"/> In 2018-19, [[Dark Horse Comics]] released a five-part adaptation of Gibson's ''Alien 3'' script, illustrated and adapted by Johnnie Christmas.

Gibson's early involvement with the film industry extended far beyond the confines of the Hollywood blockbuster system. At one point, he collaborated on a script with Kazakh director [[Rashid Nugmanov]] after an American producer had expressed an interest in a Soviet-American collaboration to star Soviet rock musician [[Viktor Tsoi]].<ref name="victor tsoi">{{cite web |url=http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2003_03_01_archive.asp#90416069 |title=Victor Tsoi |access-date=December 3, 2007 |last=Gibson |first=William |date=March 6, 2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210172807/http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2003_03_01_archive.asp#90416069 |archive-date=December 10, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Despite being occupied with writing a novel, Gibson was reluctant to abandon the "wonderfully odd project" which involved "ritualistic gang-warfare in some sort of sideways-future [[Leningrad]]" and sent [[Jack Womack]] to Russia in his stead. Rather than producing a motion picture, a prospect that ended with Tsoi's death in a car crash, Womack's experiences in Russia ultimately culminated in his novel ''[[Let's Put the Future Behind Us]]'' and informed much of the Russian content of Gibson's ''[[Pattern Recognition (novel)|Pattern Recognition]]''.<ref name="victor tsoi"/> A similar fate befell Gibson's collaboration with Japanese filmmaker [[Sogo Ishii]] in 1991,<ref name="storming"/> a film they planned on shooting in the [[Walled City of Kowloon]] until the city was demolished in 1993.<ref name="sogo">{{cite web |url=http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2006_07_01_archive.asp#115354123358489417 |title=Burst City Trailer |first=William |last=Gibson |date=July 21, 2006 |access-date=November 26, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121223044/http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2006_07_01_archive.asp#115354123358489417 |archive-date=November 21, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
[[File:The Neuromancer.jpg|thumb|left|Aside from his short stories and novels, Gibson has written several film screenplays and [[television episode]]s.]]
Adaptations of Gibson's fiction have frequently been optioned and proposed, to limited success. Two of the author's short stories, both set in the [[Sprawl trilogy]] universe, have been loosely adapted as films: ''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]'' (1995) with screenplay by Gibson and starring Keanu Reeves, Dolph Lundgren and [[Takeshi Kitano]], and ''[[New Rose Hotel (film)|New Rose Hotel]]'' (1998), starring Christopher Walken, Willem Dafoe, and Asia Argento. The former was the first time in history that a book was launched simultaneously as a film and a [[CD-ROM]] interactive video game.<ref name="mail&guardian">{{cite web |url=http://mg.co.za/article/1996-09-03-blade-runner-on-electrosteroids |title=Blade Runner on electro-steroids |access-date=November 11, 2007 |last=Walker |first=Martin |date=September 3, 1996 |website=[[Mail & Guardian#The Mail & Guardian Online|Mail & Guardian Online]] |publisher=M&G Media |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714214100/http://mg.co.za/article/1996-09-03-blade-runner-on-electrosteroids |url-status=live }}</ref> {{as of|2013}}, [[Vincenzo Natali]] still hoped to bring ''Neuromancer'' to the screen, after some years in [[development hell]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=39171 |title=Vincenzo Natali Still Hopeful For Neuromancer |date=October 28, 2013 |access-date=February 25, 2014 |website=Empire |author=Williams, Owen |archive-date=December 12, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212232316/http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=39171 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''[[Count Zero]]'' was at one point being developed as ''The Zen Differential'' with director [[Michael Mann (film director)|Michael Mann]] attached, and the third novel in the Sprawl trilogy, ''[[Mona Lisa Overdrive]]'', has also been optioned and bought.<ref name="mtv"/> An [[anime]] adaptation of ''[[Idoru]]'' was announced as in development in 2006,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://cyberpunkreview.com/movie/upcoming-movies/william-gibsons-idoru-coming-to-anime |date= April 21, 2006 |title= William Gibson's Idoru Coming to Anime |publisher= cyberpunkreview.com |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070914195904/http://www.cyberpunkreview.com/movie/upcoming-movies/william-gibsons-idoru-coming-to-anime/ |archive-date= September 14, 2007 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> and ''Pattern Recognition'' was in the process of development by director [[Peter Weir]], although according to Gibson the latter is no longer attached to the project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2007_05_01_archive.asp#2514436070772070825 |title=I've Forgotten More Neuromancer Film Deals Than You've Ever Heard Of |access-date=November 4, 2007 |last=Gibson |first=William |date=May 1, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523100703/http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2007_05_01_archive.asp#2514436070772070825 |archive-date=May 23, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Announced at [[International Film Festival Rotterdam]] in 2015 is an adaptation of Gibson's short story ''Dogfight'' by [[BAFTA]] award-winning writer and director [[Simon Pummell]].

[[File:La Fura Dels Baus Dreams In Flight.jpg|thumb|upright|Gibson has often collaborated with [[performance art]]ists such as theatre group [[La Fura dels Baus]], here performing at the [[Singapore Arts Festival]] in May 2007.]]
Gibson has contributed text to be integrated into a number of [[performance art]] pieces.

=== Cryptography ===
A particularly well-received work by Gibson was ''[[Agrippa (a book of the dead)]]'' (1992), a 300-line semi-autobiographical electronic poem that was his contribution to a collaborative project with artist [[Dennis Ashbaugh]] and publisher Kevin Begos, Jr.<ref>{{cite book

In his early short fiction, Gibson is credited by Rapatzikou in ''The Literary Encyclopedia'' with effectively "renovating" science fiction, a genre at that time considered widely "insignificant",<ref name="litencyc"/> influencing by means of the postmodern aesthetic of his writing the development of new perspectives in [[science fiction studies]].<ref name="hollinger">{{cite journal |last=Hollinger |first=Veronica |date=July 1999 |title=Contemporary Trends in Science Fiction Criticism, 1980–1999 |journal=Science Fiction Studies |volume=26 |issue=78 |url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/78/hollinger78art.htm |access-date=November 6, 2007 |archive-date=October 22, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022154814/http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/78/hollinger78art.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> In the words of filmmaker Marianne Trench, Gibson's visions "struck sparks in the real world" and "determined the way people thought and talked" to an extent unprecedented in science fiction literature.<ref name="mystic">Trench, Marianne and Peter von Brandenburg, producers. 1992.

When an interviewer in 1988 asked about the [[Bulletin Board System]] jargon in his writing, Gibson answered "I'd never so much as touched a PC when I wrote ''Neuromancer''"; he was familiar, he said, with the science-fiction community, which overlapped with the BBS community.

<blockquote>''Neuromancer'' was written on a "clockwork typewriter," the very one you may recall glimpsing in Julie Deane's office in Chiba City. This machine, a Hermes 2000 manual portable, dates from somewhere in the 1930s. It's a very tough and elegant piece of work, from the factory of E. PAILLARD & Cie S.A. YVERDON (SUISSE). Cased, it weighs slightly less than the [[Macintosh SE/30]] I now write on, and is finished in a curious green- and-black "crackle" paint-job, perhaps meant to suggest the covers of an accountant's ledger. Its keys are green as well, of celluloid, and the letters and symbols on them are canary yellow. (I once happened to brush the shift-key with the tip of a lit cigarette, dramatically confirming the extreme flammability of this early plastic.) In its day, the Hermes 2000 was one of the best portable writing-machines in the world, and one of the most expensive. This one belonged to my wife's step-grandfather, who had been a journalist of sorts and had used it to compose laudatory essays on the poetry of Robert Burns. I used it first to write undergraduate Eng. lit. papers, then my early attempts at short stories, then Neuromancer, all without so much as ever having touched an actual computer.</blockquote>}} By 1988 he used an [[Apple IIc]] and [[AppleWorks]] to write, with a modem ("I don't really use it for anything"),{{r|gibson198809}} but until 1996 Gibson did not have an email address, a lack he explained at the time to have been motivated by a desire to avoid correspondence that would distract him from writing.<ref name="josefsson"/> His first exposure to a website came while writing ''[[Idoru]]'' when a web developer built one for Gibson.<ref name="salon interview">{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/weekly/gibson961014.html |title=William Gibson Webmaster |access-date=November 6, 2007 |last=Rosenberg |first=Scott |website=The Salon Interview |publisher=[[Salon.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907144823/http://www.salon.com/weekly/gibson961014.html <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archive-date=September 7, 2007 }}</ref> In 2007 he said, "I have a 2005 [[PowerBook G4]], a [[gigabyte|gig]] of memory, [[wireless router]].
