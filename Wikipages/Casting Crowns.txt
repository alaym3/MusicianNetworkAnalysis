==History==

=== Early years and initial success ===
Christian rock group Casting Crowns began as a student worship band in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], in 1999. Led by singer, songwriter, and youth pastor Mark Hall, the group initially included guitarists Juan DeVevo and Hector Cervantes, violinist Melodee DeVevo, and drummer Rob Cervantes (a.k.a. Chavez). The group relocated to [[Stockbridge, Georgia]], in 2001, adding Chris Huffman on bass, Megan Garrett on keyboards and accordion, and drummer Andy Williams. This augmented version of Casting Crowns released two independent albums on CD, both of which were well received in the Atlanta area. Both independent albums were efforts on the part of Mark Hall and the rest of the group as outreach projects for youth in the area.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Owen | first=Linda | title=Casting Crowns' "Who Am I" | journal=[[Christianity Today]] | date=November 2005 |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/tc/2005/novdec/14.13.html | access-date=October 15, 2009 }}</ref> The group won the GMA regional songwriters competition at [[Palm Beach Atlantic University]], West Palm Beach, Florida, in both the "Best Song" and the "Best Artist" categories in 2004. Although the group was not searching for a record label, one of the group's albums found its way into the hands of Mark Miller, lead singer for country group [[Sawyer Brown]], who was struck by Casting Crowns' driving pop/rock style and Hall's vocal delivery of his hard-hitting but devout songs. Miller signed Casting Crowns to his fledgling [[Beach Street Records]], a division of [[Reunion Records]] with distribution by the Provident Label Group, making Casting Crowns the first artist signed to Beach Street Records.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Herman | first=Michael | title=Overnight Sensation | journal=[[Christianity Today]] | year=2004 |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/interviews/2004/castingcrowns-0204.html | access-date=October 8, 2009 }}</ref>

Mark Miller took the group into the studio along with co-producer [[Steven Curtis Chapman]], himself a popular artist on the CCM musical scene. The resulting [[eponymous]] album, ''[[Casting Crowns (album)|Casting Crowns]]'', was released in 2003 on the Beach Street imprint. The album quickly made them one of the fastest selling debut artists in Christian music history. The album's third single, "[[Voice of Truth (song)|Voice of Truth]]", spent a record-breaking fourteen consecutive weeks at No.&nbsp;1 beginning in 2003. "Voice of Truth" is also used in the [[trailer (film)|trailer]] and the ending from the movie ''[[Facing the Giants]]''. The album was certified platinum in 2005,<ref name="riaa">{{cite web|title=RIAA – Gold & Platinum Searchable Database |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626050454/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |archive-date=June 26, 2007  }}</ref> and in 2011, the group received their first gold certification for a single for the song '[[Who Am I (Casting Crowns song)|Who Am I]]' from their debut record.

In 2006, the group released ''Lifesong Live'', which included live performances of songs from their studio album ''Lifesong''.
