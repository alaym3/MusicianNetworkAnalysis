'''Tallah''' is a [[nu metal]] band from [[Pennsylvania]]. They are currently signed to [[Earache Records]].

== History ==
Founded in 2017, Tallah was formed by drummer Max Portnoy, who asked guitarist Derrick Schneider and bassist Andrew Cooper to join his new project. They picked up two other rhythm guitarists, AJ Wisniewski and Nick Malfara, and tried out a couple of different vocalists, but they were not what Max was looking for. Portnoy knew of future singer Justin Bonitz through Bonitz's [[YouTube]] channels, Hungry Lights and Hungry Covers, so he asked his father, [[Mike Portnoy]], to contact Bonitz, and Justin joined the band on January 1, 2018. At the end of 2017, the band had already recorded instrumental demos for their EP ''[[No One Should Read This]]'' and within a week Bonitz had written lyrics and self-recorded vocals for each track.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tallah Interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNa736ST3L0&t|date=2020|language=en|trans-title=|access-date=Feb 23, 2020}}</ref> Their first live performance was on January 7, 2018 at The Saint Vitus Bar in Brooklyn, New York, played as a six-piece with three guitarists.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tallah's First Ever Show|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/tallah/2018/saint-vitus-bar-brooklyn-ny-6b938e8a.html|date=2018|language=en|trans-title=|access-date=Jan 7, 2018}}</ref> while their first music video was released for the track "Placenta" on May 15, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|title=Placenta Music Video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcNwaqFctJI|date=2018|language=en|trans-title=|access-date=May 15, 2018}}</ref> The band then held the supporting slot for [[A Killer's Confession]] on tour.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tallah's First Ever Show|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=446909802444336&set=a.396044797530837|date=2018|language=en|trans-title=|access-date=Aug 6, 2018}}</ref>

During their first tour, in May 2018, the band released a music video for their first single, "Placenta." One of the three guitarists left, so they continued as a five-piece. In June 2018, AJ left the band, and they picked up Eric Novroski as their new rhythm guitarist. In August, 2018, they released a music video for their song "Cottonmouth" and their EP, ''No One Should Read This''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cottonmouth Music Video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMei4-pq5FY|date=2018|language=en|trans-title=|access-date=Aug 16, 2018}}</ref> On April 25, 2019 the band announced that they had signed to [[Earache Records]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Tallah signs to Earache Records|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=342497449789326&set=pcb.342497749789296|date=2019|language=en|trans-title=|access-date=Apr 25, 2019}}</ref> On July 18, 2019 the band played a show at The Lizard Lounge in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], during which a frenzied Bonitz climbed onto the ceiling of the venue. A security guard told him to get down, leading to Bonitz punching and kicking the guard. Bonitz claims he did not know the person was a security guard and that they violently grabbed him first while he was still hanging from an I-beam. He was subsequently arrested before being released on bail.<ref>{{cite web|title=Justin gets arrested|url=https://loudwire.com/tallah-justin-bonitz-missing-arrested-onstage/|date=2019|language=en|trans-title=|access-date=Jul 18, 2019}}</ref> The band released a music video for the song "Red Light" on January 21, 2020, and announced that they were entering the studio with Josh Schroeder.<ref>{{cite web|title=Red Light Music Video|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=342497449789326&set=pcb.342497749789296|date=2019|language=en|trans-title=|access-date=Apr 25, 2019}}</ref> In October 2019, the band parted ways with Eric, and in January 2020, they went to the studio as a four-piece, with Mewzen tagging along as the mysterious, unofficial turntable player. On February 18, 2020 they announced their new album entitled ''Matriphagy''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tallah Announce there new album title|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B8u5omSAIj9/|date=2020|language=en|trans-title=|access-date=Feb 18, 2020}}</ref> Tallah revealed the album's tracklist and release date of October 2, 2020, later releasing the single "The Silo" on June 5, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tallah Reveal the tracklist for matriphagy|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ_DHPhdL9Q|date=2020|language=en|trans-title=|access-date=May 20, 2020}}</ref>

Tallah released a live shot concert on October 1, 2020 in which they played their debut album "Matriphagy" from front to back. Here, they announced that Mewzen would be an official member, and they also debuted their new rhythm guitarist, Alex Snowden.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tallah - October 1, 2020 (Matriphagy in full)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0YwnIxyQmg|date=Oct 1, 2020|language=en|trans-title=|access-date=Nov 23, 2020}}</ref>
