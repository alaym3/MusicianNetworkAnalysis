'''Lainey Wilson''' (born May 19, 1992) is an American [[country music]] artist. Signed to [[BBR Music Group]], she has released one album and two singles, including "[[Things a Man Oughta Know]]", which reached number one.

==Biography==
Wilson was born in [[Baskin, Louisiana]]. Her dad taught her a couple chords two years after she started writing songs (age 11). She impersonated ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' as her job in high school, touring across Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi. She released an EP titled ''Country Girls Rule'' on [[MySpace]] in 2006. She moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], after graduating high school and recorded music in a camper trailer that she lived in for 3 years. She parked it beside a recording studio belonging to family friend, Jerry Cupit. This led to her self-titled independent debut album in 2014. A second independent album titled ''Tougher'' followed in 2016 on the Lone Chief label. It charted on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top Country Albums]] chart upon its release.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/lainey-wilson-mn0003508331/biography | title=Lainey Wilson biography | publisher=AllMusic | accessdate=April 5, 2021}}</ref>

Following these, she released a self-titled [[extended play]] in 2018. The success of her independent releases led to a publishing contract with [[Sony Music Publishing]], followed by a recording contract with [[BBR Music Group]] and her first major label release, the ''Redneck Hollywood'' EP. Wilson also began touring with [[Morgan Wallen]] in 2019.<ref name="allmusic"/> In February 2020, Wilson performed on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] for the first time.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/9325188/lainey-wilson-emerging-country-interview | title=Emerging Country: From 'LA' to the Grand Ole Opry, 'Dirty Looks' Singer Lainey Wilson’s Dream Is Realized | publisher=Billboard | date=February 28, 2020 | accessdate=April 5, 2021}}</ref> Following the release of the ''Redneck Hollywood'' EP, Wilson released "Dirty Looks" as her first single to country radio in October 2019. When this single failed to chart, another song from the EP, "[[Things a Man Oughta Know]]", was sent to country radio in August 2020.

Her first major label studio album, ''[[Sayin' What I'm Thinkin']]'', was released in February 2021. [[Jay Joyce]] produced this project.<ref name="allmusic"/> Two months later, "Things a Man Oughta Know" had reached the top five of the ''Billboard'' [[Country Airplay]] and Hot Country Songs charts.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://bulletins.billboard.com/country/country_update_2021_0329.pdf | title=Billboard Country Update | publisher=Billboard | date=March 29, 2021 | accessdate=April 5, 2021}}</ref> The song became Wilson's first number one single on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Songs chart in September 2021, a little over a year after the song was first sent to country radio.

Wilson has played live on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s program ''[[Loose Ends (radio programme)|Loose Ends]]'' twice, performing "Dirty Looks" in May 2020<ref>{{cite episode| title= Twiggy, Imelda May, Juno Dawson, Nick Lowe, Lainey Wilson, Nikki Bedi, Clive Anderson| series= [[Loose Ends (radio programme)|Loose Ends]]| minutes= 25:25| airdate= 20 May 2020| credits= Presenter: [[Clive Anderson]]; guest: Lainey Wilson| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000jnsd | accessdate= 1 May 2021 }}</ref> and "WWDD" in May 2021.<ref>{{cite episode| title= Marianne Faithfull, Stephen Mangan, Kristin Hersh, Lainey Wilson, Matt Sweeney and Bonnie 'Prince' Billy, SVN, Gemma Cairney| series= [[Loose Ends (radio programme)|Loose Ends]]| minutes= 11:18| airdate= 1 May 2021| credits= Presenter: [[Clive Anderson]]; guest: Lainey Wilson| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000vpyb | accessdate= 1 May 2021 }}</ref>
