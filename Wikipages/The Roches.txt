The Roches were active as performers and recording artists from the mid-1970s through 2017, at various times performing as a trio and in pairs.

==Career==
In the late 1960s, eldest sister Maggie (October 26, 1951<ref name=folkville>{{cite web|url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/pawtrait/folkville/biographies/TheRoches.html |title=folkville-introduction |website=Myweb.tiscali.co.uk |access-date=January 21, 2017}}</ref> – January 21, 2017<ref name=pitchfork/>) and middle sister Terre (pronounced "Terry", born April 10, 1953<ref name=folkville/>) attended [[Park Ridge High School]],<ref>Karas, Matty. [https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/145159832/ "'Uncool' Roches finally fitting into the music scene"], ''[[Asbury Park Press]]'', June 20, 1991. Accessed December 9, 2017. "Terre Roche wasn't one of the cool kids at Park Ridge High School in the late 1960s.... She and Maggie sang together from a young age, with Maggie teaching Terre the harmony parts to songs. When they were in high school, their father, who lived in Greenwich Village before they were born and entertained them with stories about those days, drove them into the Village to sing in hootenannies at clubs such as the Gaslight and Kettle of Fish."</ref> but dropped out of school to tour as a duo. Maggie wrote most of the songs, with Terre contributing to a few. The sisters got a break when [[Paul Simon]] brought them in as backup singers on his 1973 album ''[[There Goes Rhymin' Simon]]''.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music|title-link=Encyclopedia of Popular Music|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|pages=1023/4}}</ref> They got his assistance (along with an appearance by [[the Oak Ridge Boys]]) on their only album as a duo, ''[[Seductive Reasoning]]'' (1975).<ref name="Larkin"/>

Reviewing ''Seductive Reasoning'' in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981), [[Robert Christgau]] said, "Female singing duos must function as mutual support groups; last time a women's sensibility this assured, relaxed, and reflective made it to vinyl was [[Joy of Cooking (band)|Joy of Cooking]]. These folkies manque are a little flat here, a little arch there, but in general the shoe fits; no ideological feminism, but plenty of consciousness."<ref name="CG">{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|title-link=Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: R|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=R&bk=70|access-date=March 12, 2019|website=Robertchristgau.com}}</ref>

Later in the 1970s youngest sister [[Suzzy Roche|Suzzy]] (rhymes with "fuzzy", born September 29, 1956<ref name=folkville/>) joined the group to form the Roches trio.<ref name="Larkin"/>

Around this time, they parlayed bartending jobs at the Greenwich Village folk venue [[Gerde's Folk City]] into stage appearances, an experience they commemorated in their song "Face Down at Folk City" (from ''Another World'', 1985). There they met many of their future singing and songwriting collaborators. Terre was now writing songs as well, and by the time of their first album as a trio, ''[[The Roches (album)|The Roches]]'' (1979), Suzzy had also begun writing.<ref name="Larkin"/> [[Robert Fripp]] produced the album.<ref name="Larkin"/> Maggie's "The Married Men" from this album was eventually to become the songwriting trio's biggest hit—not for them, but for [[Phoebe Laub|Phoebe Snow]].<ref name="Larkin"/> After Snow and [[Linda Ronstadt]] performed the song in a duet on ''[[Saturday Night Live (season 4)|Saturday Night Live]]'', the Roches were invited to perform [[Saturday Night Live (season 5)|on the show a few months later]] in 1979 at Simon's behest. They did two songs, both unreleased at the time: "Bobby's Song" and "The Hallelujah Chorus".

Throughout the 1980s, the Roches continued to release their music to small audiences, little or no air play, and only modest record sales. A 1983 episode of the [[PBS]] concert series ''[[Soundstage]]'' was devoted to an hourlong performance by the trio, and they appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' in November 1985, performing their song "Mr. Sellack". In 1990, they returned to their Christmas-caroling roots with the release of the 24-track ''We Three Kings'',<ref name="Larkin"/> which included the ''[[a cappella]]'' "Star of Wonder", written by Terre. After another pop album (''A Dove'', 1992), they recorded an entire album of children's songs, ''Will You Be My Friend?'', featuring a song by brother David and various young backup singers, including Suzzy's daughter [[Lucy Wainwright Roche]].

After a tour interrupted by the death of their father, the Roches released ''Can We Go Home Now'' (1995),<ref name="Larkin"/> the last original recording they released as a trio until 2007.

In 1997, the sisters formally put their group on long-term hold. They continued to work on solo projects and often collaborated on albums and performances. Terre teaches guitar workshops and has released a solo album. Suzzy, who has acted on the stage and in several movies, released two of her own albums and two with Maggie, with whom she toured. All three sisters periodically participated in New York-area events. At the end of 2005, the three Roches (with brother Dave) reunited for a short but successful holiday tour. Several more appearances in the U.S. and Canada took place in 2006–07, and in March 2007, after a 12-year hiatus, the Roches released a new studio album, ''Moonswept''.<ref name="homepage">{{cite web|url = http://www.roches.com/index.html|title = "The Roches" (home page)|publisher = Roches official website|access-date = January 21, 2007}}</ref> After the tour for ''Moonswept'', the Roches announced that they would no longer be touring, but they continued to make isolated appearances individually and as a group, mostly in and around New York City.

On January 21, 2017, Maggie Roche died from [[breast cancer]] at the age of 65.<ref name=pitchfork>{{cite web|title=The Roches' Maggie Roche Dead at 65|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/71048-the-roches-maggie-roche-dead-at-65/|website=Pitchfork.com|date=January 21, 2017|access-date=January 21, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/music/news/maggie-roche-dead-dies-the-roches-1201966508/|title=Maggie Roche, Singer With Neo-Folk Trio The Roches, Dies at 65|first=Pat|last=Saperstein|date=January 22, 2017|website=Variety.com|access-date=January 22, 2017}}</ref> In a statement on Facebook, Suzzy wrote that Maggie "was a private person, too sensitive and shy for this world, but brimming with life, love, and talent.

== Family ==
Maggie Roche had an "unusual" [[contralto]] voice—"almost a baritone."<ref name="ithacatimesartsblog.com"/> Terre provides a [[soprano]] that brackets the upper range of the sisters, while Suzzy fills in the middle range. While touring, the sisters accompanied themselves with guitars and keyboards, occasionally with additional musicians.

Terre Roche continues to perform publicly in New York City, and since 2016 has led a "Sunset Singing Circle" at Battery Park on the southern tip of Manhattan under the auspices of the Parks Department.<ref name="terre-sunset-circle">

Most of the Roches' songs were written by the three sisters, whether individually, in every combination, or collaborating with other songwriters. They also recorded their own arrangements of songs by a variety of New York folk artists, as well as a few covers of famous songs. Their three-part arrangement of the four-part "[[Hallelujah Chorus]]" from [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'', featured on ''[[Keep On Doing]]'' (1982), is well regarded in ''[[a cappella]]'' circles.
