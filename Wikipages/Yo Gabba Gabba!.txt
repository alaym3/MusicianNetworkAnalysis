'''''Yo Gabba Gabba!''''' is a [[children's television show|children's television series]] starring five costumed toys come-to-life and their friend [[Lance Robertson|DJ Lance Rock]]. It is co-produced by Magic Store Productions and [[WildBrain]]. Its first episode premiered on [[Nickelodeon]] on August 20, 2007, as a part of its [[Nick Jr. (TV programming block)|Nick Jr.]] block. The last episode premiered on November 12, 2015. 

A single topic is addressed in each episode (such as "Adventure", "Friends", or "Dance") through songs and short storylines. Additionally, the show teaches children life and social skills, such as sharing and trying different foods. It also encourages viewers to move along with and dance with the characters in the program. The show is noted for its indie-culture guest stars and bands, and for drawing visual inspiration from 8-bit video games and ''[[H.R. Pufnstuf]]'', among other television shows. Created by [[Christian Jacobs]] (lead singer of [[the Aquabats]]) and [[Scott Schultz (producer)|Scott Schultz]], the show's learning process has parents, older siblings, and younger children watch the show together rather than letting it act as a babysitter. The television program spawned a touring live stage show, several toys, and branded clothing.

On September 10, 2021, [[WildBrain]] announced that the series would be revived for 20 new episodes, which will be produced in collaboration between WildBrain and Yo Gabba Gabba LLC (the co-owners of the ''Yo Gabba Gabba!'' brand).<ref>https://www.wildbrain.com/newsreleases/yo-gabba-gabba-headed-to-apple-tv-with-new-original-series/</ref> The new episodes will premiere on [[Apple TV+]], which also acquired the previous episodes and specials for its service.

==Overview==
Hosted by a character named [[DJ Lance Rock]], the series features live-action segments featuring 5 toys: Muno (a red cyclops), Foofa (a pink flower-bubble), Brobee (a green monster), Toodee (a blue cat/dragon), and Plex (a yellow robot). In between the main segments are many short animated sketches and songs.<ref>Garofoli, Joe: "[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/08/17/DDL2RJTGF.DTL Preschooler TV goes hip with 'Yo Gabba Gabba']", ''San Francisco Chronicle'', 17 August 2007</ref>

Among the varied animation sequences during the show was ''Super Martian Robot Girl'', designed by indie cartoonists [[Evan Dorkin]] and [[Sarah Dyer]].<ref>[http://evandorkin.livejournal.com/130835.html evandorkin: The Last Round-Up (Pre-TCAF)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110062156/http://evandorkin.livejournal.com/130835.html |date=January 10, 2016 }}</ref> The title character of that segment was voiced by [[Ariela Barer]] in season one and by Caroline Jacobs in season three.

Famous musicians who have appeared on the show include [[Mos Def]], [[Bootsy Collins]], [[Ladytron]], [[The Killers]], [[Enon (band)|Enon]], [[The Clientele]], [[Jimmy Eat World]], [[Solange Knowles]], [[Taking Back Sunday]], [[Datarock]], [[The Aquabats]], [[Devo]], [[Anne Heche]], [[Joy Zipper]], [[Of Montreal]], [[Chromeo]], [[My Chemical Romance]], [[Weezer]], [[Hot Hot Heat]], [[The Faint]], [[The Roots]], [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]], [[Mates of State]], [[MGMT]], [[Peter Bjorn and John]], [[Trunk Boiz]], [[The Shins]], [[The Aggrolites]], [[The Flaming Lips]], [[Mýa|Mya]], [[Biz Markie]], [[Blitzen Trapper]], [[The Ting Tings]], [[Money Mark]], [[The Bronx (band)|Mariachi El Bronx]], [["Weird Al" Yankovic]], [[Erykah Badu]]. Other celebrity guests to have appeared include [[Jason Bateman]], [[Jack Black]], [[Andy Samberg]], [[Melora Hardin]], [[Tony Hawk]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Sarah Silverman]], [[Laila Ali]], [[Bill Hader]], and [[Anthony Bourdain]].

Kidrobot made the toy models of the characters that appear at the beginning and end of each episode. The title of the show pays homage to "Gabba Gabba Hey" from the punk rock band, [[Ramones|The Ramones]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/2008-10-20-gabba-gabba_N.htm|title='Yo Gabba Gabba!' is monstrous fun for kids, adults|author=Keveney, Bill|date=October 21, 2008|work=USA Today|access-date=July 22, 2020}}</ref>

==History==
''Yo Gabba Gabba!'' was developed by two Southern California fathers and punk rockers, [[Christian Jacobs]] and [[Scott Schultz (producer)|Scott Schultz]], who first started working together as teenagers, producing and directing skateboarding videos. Their goal was to design a kids' show that was entertaining while featuring real artists and real performers. Both had no past experience writing scripts for television, let alone children's broadcasting or education.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wildbrain.com/animation/about_us/bios/pdf/director/Jacobs_Schultz_bio.pdf |title=Christian Jacobs & Scott Schultz: Co-Creators, Yo Gabba Gabba! |publisher=[[Wild Brain]] |access-date=2013-08-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312133918/http://www.wildbrain.com/animation/about_us/bios/pdf/director/Jacobs_Schultz_bio.pdf |archive-date=March 12, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In developing the show they took inspiration from a number of classic children's series including ''[[Sesame Street]]'', ''[[The Electric Company]]'', ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'', ''[[Zoom (1999 TV series)|ZOOM]]'', as well as [[Sid and Marty Krofft]] puppet shows ''[[The Banana Splits|Banana Splits]]'' and ''[[H.R. Pufnstuf|H. R.

In 1999, after becoming parents, Jacobs and Schultz started playing around with ideas for children's television and produced a pilot independently financed by small loans from friends and family. ''Yo Gabba Gabba!'' did not get much attention until it started circulating on the Internet.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://boingboing.net/2006/06/02/new-kids-show-yo-gab.html | work=Boing Boing | first=Mark | last=Frauenfelder | title=New kids' show: Yo Gabba Gabba | date=June 2, 2006}}</ref> [[Jared Hess]], the director of ''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]'' and ''[[Nacho Libre]]'', saw the pilot online and recommended it to Brown Johnson, the executive vice president and executive creative director of [[Nickelodeon]] Preschool.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/12/arts/television/12itzk.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | first=Dave | last=Itzkoff | title=Charm the Children, Tickle the Parents | date=August 12, 2007}}</ref>

==Episode format==
All episodes follow a similar format. In the opening scene of the episode, DJ Lance Rock is shown walking on a plain white background while holding a silver radio with colorful buttons. He then arrives at a table with four different colored lands and a silver design underneath it. He then places down the boombox, and then he shouts "YOOOO Gabba Gabba!" and opens the radio, and inside it are five toys: Muno, Foofa, Brobee, Toodee, and Plex. He places down the toys one-by-one, and then they become alive.

The episode features four main segments (shortened to three after the first season) that are connected to each other as a plot. They involve DJ Lance and the Gabba gang doing an activity. After each main segment, a short clip is shown that shows a child dancing around. The child says his or her name, followed by "I like to dance!".

Between the main segments, there is another segment called "The Super Music Friends Show", which features a performance by a artist or a band about the episode's theme. Other small segments include "Mark's Magic Pictures" and "Biz's Beat of the Day".

Near the end of each episode, DJ Lance and the Gabba gang do a mix-like song about what had occurred during the main segments. After it is finished, DJ Lance thanks to the children at home for playing along and shouts "YOOOO Gabba Gabba!" once again, and then Muno, Foofa, Brobee, Toodee, and Plex turn back into toys. One-by-one, DJ Lance puts them back in the boombox, closes the boombox, and then walks off carrying it, thus ending each episode.
