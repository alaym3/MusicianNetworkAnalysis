==History==
Thao Nguyen met drummer Willis Thompson while studying for her degrees in Sociology and Women's Studies at [[College of William & Mary]].<ref>[http://blog.kexp.org/blog/2009/09/30/song-of-the-day-thao-with-the-get-down-stay-down-know-better-learn-faster/ Song of the Day: September 30, 2009 - Kexp.org] Retrieved 2011-01-25.</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Thao Nguyen's Women's Prison Work: The Painful, Inspiring Stories of Four Inmates|url=http://www.spinner.com/2013/03/07/thao-nguyen-womens-prison-essay/|website=Spinner.com|access-date=17 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Singer-songwriter Thao Nguyen (Women’s Studies, ’06) releases her new album|url=http://www.wm.edu/as/womensstudies/news/singer-songwriter-thao-nguyen-womens-studies,-06-releases-her-new-album.php|publisher=College of William & Mary|access-date=17 June 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513032420/https://www.wm.edu/as/womensstudies/news/singer-songwriter-thao-nguyen-womens-studies,-06-releases-her-new-album.php|archive-date=13 May 2011}}</ref> Willis Thompson was a member of Camp Tigerclaw, Acousticore, and Murphy's Kids. He is also a contributing member to the band The Light Footwork. Thao Nguyen and Willis Thompson met Adam Thompson (no relation) during a show at the Harrison Street Coffee Shop in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. At the time, Adam Thompson was performing as a solo jazz-influenced act under the moniker The OK Bird.  Frank Stewart, member of the bands Durian and Verbal, would produce the first album ''[[Like the Linen]]'' in 2005 and join the band as a lead guitarist. Although only Willis and Nguyen initially performed live on tour, the four members began touring as a group during the [[Kill Rock Stars]]' Sound the Hare Heard tour during the summer of 2006.  The name of the band was originally suggested by a former bassist of the band.  Nguyen would expand the initial suggestion of "The Get Down" to "The Get Down Stay Down". Thao Nguyen still occasionally performs as a soloist, including a European tour with [[Laura Veirs]] and the Tortured Souls in August 2006.

After sending ''Like the Linen'' to Laura Veirs, Thao connected with [[Tucker Martine]], Veirs' drummer and producer for [[The Decemberists]] and [[Sufjan Stevens]]. In August 2006, the group began recording with Martine in Seattle and released the album, ''[[We Brave Bee Stings and All]]'', in January 2008. Thao Nguyen has since moved to [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. The band toured in 2008 with [[Xiu Xiu]], and separately with [[Rilo Kiley]] before heading out on their first headlining tour that summer.<ref>{{cite web|last=Katzif |first=Mike |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94282059 |title=Thao Nguyen: Tiny Desk Concert |website=Npr.org |access-date=2016-06-04}}</ref>

Thao & the Get Down Stay Down released their second album, ''[[Know Better Learn Faster]]'', on October 13, 2009. Thao was joined by [[Andrew Bird]] on the title track. The band toured the US with [[The Portland Cello Project]] and David Shultz and the Skyline in late 2009, and spent time touring the US and Europe in Winter/Spring 2010.

In early 2010, Nguyen collaborated with [[Mirah]], culminating in a collaborative album.

The band's track "When We Swam" is the opening theme for Australian prime-time TV series ''[[Offspring (TV series)|Offspring]]'' (which premiered in Australia in August 2010).

The band also composed and performed the soundtrack for the 2011 film, ''American Teacher''.<ref>{{cite web|title=American Teacher Soundtrack|url=http://differentfurstudios.com/blog/?p=4948|publisher=Different Fur Studios|website=Differentfurstudios.com|access-date=6 July 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725163220/http://differentfurstudios.com/blog/?p=4948|archive-date=25 July 2011}}</ref>
