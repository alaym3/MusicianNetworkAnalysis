He acknowledged that he had learned from the experience and felt terrible about it as well. According to Ray J, he went through a time of deep depression following the encounter, all the while trying to figure out what led him to act out the way he did and "how can I now grow and be better?"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/16/ray-j-fabolous-breakfast-club_n_5831416.html|title=Ray J Takes 'Full Blame' For Rant Against Fabolous On 'The Breakfast Club'|date=September 16, 2014|work=The Huffington Post|first=Chris|last=Branch}}</ref>

On May 30, 2014, Ray J was at a bar of the [[Beverly Wilshire Hotel]] in [[Beverly Hills, California]] when a woman accused him of inappropriately touching her posterior. Police were called and deemed the touching incidental but he was asked to leave by the hotel staff. Ray J became angered because he contends he spent tens of thousands of dollars at the hotel over the last year. At some point, he allegedly became belligerent and according to the police, spat at an officer and kicked out a police car window in the process of being arrested. The charges against him included vandalism, resisting arrest and battery against a police officer. Ray J posted $20,000 bail and was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/singer-ray-arrested-beverly-hills-hotel-23942573|title=Entertainment Index|work=ABC News|access-date=September 16, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Ray-J-Arrested-at-Beverly-Hills-Hotel-261346231.html|title=Singer Ray J Out on Bail After Arrest at Beverly Hills Hotel|access-date=September 16, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tmz.com/2014/05/30/ray-j-arrested-beverly-wilshire-hotel-beverly-hills/|title=Ray J ARRESTED -- Allegedly Spit on Cops [PHOTO UPDATE]|access-date=September 16, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2014/05/31/singer-ray-j-arrested-for-allegedly-getting-belligerent-at-beverly-hills-hotel/|title=Singer Ray J Arrested For Allegedly Getting Belligerent At Beverly Hills Hotel|date=May 31, 2014|access-date=September 16, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2014/05/31/Ray-J-arrested-in-Beverly-Hills-scuffle/6921401591342/|title=Ray J arrested in Beverly Hills scuffle|access-date=September 16, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tmz.com/2014/06/02/ray-j-cops-beverly-wilshire-hotel-beverly-hills-arrest-spitting/|title=Ray J -- Claustrophobia Made Me Kick Out Cop Car Window|access-date=September 16, 2016}}</ref> The Los Angeles County district attorney on July 21, 2014, filed charges against Ray J and a police spokesman said his initial hearing would take place on July 25.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ksat.com/content/pns/ksat/news/2014/07/22/ent-ray-j-norwood-charges.html|title=Singer Ray J Norwood charged with sexual battery, vandalism, resisting arrest|date=July 22, 2014|publisher=KSAT|first=Alan|last=Dukes|access-date=July 24, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812103722/http://www.ksat.com/content/pns/ksat/news/2014/07/22/ent-ray-j-norwood-charges.html|archive-date=August 12, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
