==Early life==

{{Section refimprove|date=February 2019}}
Tyron Kaymone Frampton was born on 18 December 1994 in [[Northampton]] to a teenage mother of [[Barbados|Barbadian]] descent. Frampton was raised by his single mother in a council estate in the Lings area of Northampton. His step-father later moved in and his younger brother Michael was born in 2000 with [[muscular dystrophy]] (MD). He died in 2001 which greatly affected Frampton. Frampton attended [[Northampton Academy]] and in 2011 attended [[Northampton College]], where he studied for a [[Business and Technology Education Council|BTEC]] in Music Technology.

Slowthai frequently [[truancy|skipped school]] during his years at Northampton Academy and often spent time at a nearby underground ‚Äúrecording studio‚Äù at his friend's house, only stopping when his mother was forced to attend a compulsory court hearing.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.nme.com/big-reads/the-big-read-slowthai-2417702|title=The Big Read ‚Äì Slowthai: "Is Britain actually great, or are you?"|website=NME|language=en|access-date=14 August 2020}}</ref> After college, Slowthai had multiple miscellaneous short stints in employment ‚Äì he worked as a [[labourer]], a [[plasterer]] and at a branch of [[Next plc|Next]] before being sacked for breach of contract after he gave his friend employee discounts.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/music/slowthai-interview-tour-london-age-a4061216.html|title= Slowthai interview: 'I lost my mind on drugs|website=Standard|language=en|access-date=8 February 2019}}</ref> After his dismissal, he focused entirely on music; he downloaded a copy of [[FL Studio]] and released numerous singles and an extended play under the Bone Soda label.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}
