'''Shellac''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|ə|ˈ|l|æ|k}})<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/shellac |work=Cambridge Dictionary |access-date=19 October 2020 |title=Shellac }}</ref> is a [[resin]] secreted by the female [[Kerria lacca|lac bug]] on trees in the forests of India and Thailand. It is processed and sold as dry flakes and dissolved in [[ethanol|alcohol]] to make liquid shellac, which is used as a brush-on colorant, food [[glazing agent|glaze]] and [[wood finish]]. Shellac functions as a tough natural [[primer (paint)|primer]], [[sanding]] [[sealant]], [[tannin]]-blocker, [[odour]]-blocker, [[wood stain|stain]], and [[Gloss (material appearance)|high-gloss]] [[varnish]]. Shellac was once used in electrical applications as it possesses good [[electrical insulation|insulation]] qualities and it seals out moisture. [[Phonograph]] and 78&nbsp;rpm [[gramophone record]]s were made of it until they were replaced by [[polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] [[LP record|long-playing record]]s from the 1950s onwards.

From the time it replaced oil and wax finishes in the 19th century, shellac was one of the dominant wood finishes in the western world until it was largely replaced by [[nitrocellulose lacquer]] in the 1920s and 1930s.

== Etymology ==
''Shellac'' comes from ''shell'' and ''[[lac]]'', a [[calque]] of [[French language|French]] {{lang|fr|laque en écailles}}, 'lac in thin pieces', later {{lang|fr|gomme-laque}}, 'gum lac'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=shellac |title=shellac |website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |access-date=17 March 2015}}</ref> Most European languages (except [[Romance languages|Romance]] ones and Greek) have borrowed the word for the substance from English or from the [[German language|German]] equivalent {{lang|de|Schellack}}.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Peter|date=2016-12-15|title=§4.

{{see also|Lac}}
Shellac is scraped from the [[Bark (botany)|bark]] of the trees where the female lac bug, ''[[Kerria lacca]]'' (order Hemiptera, family [[Kerriidae]], also known as ''Laccifer lacca''), secretes it to form a tunnel-like tube as it traverses the branches of the tree. Though these tunnels are sometimes referred to as "[[Cocoon (silk)|cocoons]]", they are not cocoons in the entomological sense. This insect is in the same [[Superfamily (zoology)|superfamily]] as the insect from which [[cochineal#Dye|cochineal]] is obtained. The insects suck the sap of the tree and excrete "[[sticklac]]" almost constantly. The least-coloured shellac is produced when the insects feed on the kusum tree (''[[Schleichera]]'').{{Cn|date=January 2021}}

The number of lac bugs required to produce {{convert|1|kg|1}} of shellac has variously been estimated as {{formatnum:50000}},<ref name=BabooGoswami2010Page4>{{cite book|author1=Bangali Baboo|author2=D.

The raw shellac, which contains bark shavings and lac bugs removed during scraping, is placed in canvas tubes (much like long socks) and heated over a fire. This causes the shellac to liquefy, and it seeps out of the canvas, leaving the bark and bugs behind. The thick, sticky shellac is then dried into a flat sheet and broken into flakes, or dried into "buttons" (pucks/cakes), then bagged and sold. The end-user then crushes it into a fine powder and mixes it with [[ethyl alcohol]] before use, to dissolve the flakes and make liquid shellac.<ref>{{Cite web|title=How and why to mix fresh shellac|url=https://www.stewmac.com/video-and-ideas/online-resources/learn-about-instrument-finishing-and-finish-repair/how-and-why-to-mix-fresh-shellac/|access-date=2021-10-13|website=www.stewmac.com|language=en}}</ref>

Liquid shellac has a limited shelf life (about 1 year), so is sold in dry form for dissolution before use. Liquid shellac sold in hardware stores is often marked with the production (mixing) date, so the consumer can know whether the shellac inside is still good. Some manufacturers (e.g., Zinsser) have ceased labeling shellac with the production date, but the production date may be discernible from the production lot code. Alternatively, old shellac may be tested to see if it is still usable: a few drops on glass should dry to a hard surface in roughly 15 minutes. Shellac that remains tacky for a long time is no longer usable. Storage life depends on peak temperature, so refrigeration extends shelf life.{{Cn|date=January 2021}}

The thickness (concentration) of shellac is measured by the unit "pound cut", referring to the amount (in pounds) of shellac flakes dissolved in a gallon of denatured alcohol. For example: a 1-lb. cut of shellac is the strength obtained by dissolving one pound of shellac flakes in a gallon of alcohol (equivalent to {{convert|1|lb/USgal|g/l|abbr=off|disp=out}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.shellac.net/PoundCutChart.html |title= Dissolving & Mixing Shellac Flakes: Shellac 'Pound Cut' Chart |website=shellac.net |access-date=19 October 2020 }}</ref> Most pre-mixed commercial preparations come at a 3-lb. cut. Multiple thin layers of shellac produce a significantly better end result than a few thick layers. Thick layers of shellac do not adhere to the substrate or to each other well, and thus can peel off with relative ease; in addition, thick shellac will obscure fine details in carved designs in wood and other substrates.{{Cn|date=January 2021}}

Shellac naturally dries to a high-gloss sheen. For applications where a flatter (less shiny) sheen is desired, products containing amorphous silica, such as "Shellac Flat", may be added to the dissolved shellac.<ref>[http://americanwoodworker.com/blogs/shop/archive/2009/07/02/shellac.aspx American Woodworker: Tips for Using Shellac]</ref>

Shellac naturally contains a small amount of wax (3%–5% by volume), which comes from the lac bug. In some preparations, this wax is removed (the resulting product being called "dewaxed shellac"). This is done for applications where the shellac will be coated with something else (such as paint or varnish), so the topcoat will adhere. Waxy (non-dewaxed) shellac appears milky in liquid form, but dries clear.{{Cn|date=January 2021}}

== Colours and availability ==
Shellac comes in many warm colours, ranging from a very light blonde ("platina") to a very dark brown ("garnet"), with many varieties of brown, yellow, orange and red in between. The colour is influenced by the sap of the tree the lac bug is living on and by the time of harvest. Historically, the most commonly sold shellac is called "orange shellac", and was used extensively as a combination stain and protectant for wood panelling and [[cabinetry]] in the 20th century.{{Cn|date=January 2021}}

Shellac was once very common anywhere paints or varnishes were sold (such as hardware stores). However, cheaper and more abrasion- and chemical-resistant finishes, such as [[polyurethane]], have almost completely replaced it in decorative residential wood finishing such as hardwood floors, wooden [[wainscoting]] plank panelling, and kitchen cabinets.  These alternative products, however, must be applied over a stain if the user wants the wood to be coloured; clear or blonde shellac may be applied over a stain without affecting the colour of the finished piece, as a protective topcoat. "Wax over shellac" (an application of buffed-on paste wax over several coats of shellac) is often regarded as a beautiful, if fragile, finish for hardwood floors. [[Luthier]]s still use shellac to ''[[French polish]]'' fine acoustic stringed instruments, but it has been replaced by synthetic plastic lacquers and varnishes in many workshops, especially high-volume production environments.<ref>[http://www.milburnguitars.com/fpbannerframes.html French polishing tutorial for guitars]</ref>

Shellac dissolved in alcohol, typically more dilute than French-Polish, is now commonly sold as "sanding sealer" by several companies. It is used to seal wooden surfaces, often as preparation for a final more durable finish; it reduces the amount of final coating required by reducing its absorption into the wood.{{Cn|date=January 2021}}

== Properties ==
[[File:Haydn shellac.jpg|thumb|right|A decorative medal made in France in the early 20th century moulded from shellac compound, the same used for [[phonograph record]]s of the period]]
Shellac is a natural [[bioadhesive]] [[polymer]] and is chemically similar to synthetic polymers.<ref>https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/shellac gives the chief component as 9,10,15-trihydroxypentadecanoic acid and also (2R,6S,7R,10S)-10-hydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)-6-methyltricycloundec-8-ene-2,8-dicarboxylic acid, molecular formula C<sub>30</sub>H<sub>50</sub>O<sub>11</sub> with a molecular weight of 586.7 g/mol </ref> It can thus can be considered a natural form of [[plastic]].{{Cn|date=January 2021}}
 
With a melting point of {{convert|75|C}}, it can be classed as a [[thermoplastic]];<ref> {{cite web |title= Properties of Shellac CAS No.9000-59-3 |url=https://www.chemicalbook.com/ProductMSDSDetailCB1314474_EN.htm}}</ref> used to bind [[wood flour]], the mixture can be [[moulding (process)|moulded]] with heat and pressure.{{Cn|date=January 2021}}

Shellac scratches more easily than most lacquers and varnishes, and application is more labour-intensive, which is why it has been replaced by plastic in most areas. But damaged shellac can easily be touched up with another coat of shellac (unlike polyurethane, which chemically cures to a solid) because the new coat merges with and bonds to the existing coat(s). Shellac is much softer than [[Urushi]] lacquer, for instance, which is far superior with regard to both chemical and mechanical resistance.{{Cn|date=January 2021}}

Shellac is [[solubility|soluble]] in [[alkaline]] solutions such as [[ammonia]], [[sodium borate]], [[sodium carbonate]], and [[sodium hydroxide]], and also in various [[organic solvent]]s. When dissolved in alcohol (typically denatured ethanol) for application, shellac yields a coating of good durability and hardness.{{Cn|date=January 2021}}

Upon mild [[hydrolysis]] shellac gives a complex mix of [[aliphatic]] and [[alicyclic]] [[hydroxy acids]] and their polymers that varies in exact composition depending upon the source of the shellac and the season of collection. The major component of the aliphatic component is [[aleuritic acid]], whereas the main alicyclic component is [[shellolic acid]].<ref name="Merck Index, 9th Ed. page 8224">Merck Index, 9th Ed. page 8224.</ref>

Shellac is UV-resistant, and does not darken as it ages (though the wood under it may do so, as in the case of pine).<ref name="naturalhandyman.com" />

== History ==
The earliest written evidence of shellac goes back {{formatnum:3000}} years, but shellac is known to have been used earlier.<ref name="naturalhandyman.com">[http://www.naturalhandyman.com/iip/author/zinsser/shellac.html Naturalhandyman.com : DEFEND, PRESERVE, AND PROTECT WITH SHELLAC : The story of shellac]</ref> According to the ancient Indian epic poem, the [[Mahabharata]], an entire palace was built out of dried shellac.<ref name="naturalhandyman.com" />

The use of overall paint or varnish decoration on large pieces of furniture was first popularised in Venice (then later throughout Italy). There are a number of 13th-century references to painted or varnished [[cassone]], often [[dowry]] cassone that were made deliberately impressive as part of dynastic marriages. The definition of varnish is not always clear, but it seems to have been a [[Varnish#Shellac|spirit varnish]] based on [[Benzoin resin|gum benjamin]] or [[Mastic (plant resin)|mastic]], both traded around the Mediterranean. At some time, shellac began to be used as well. An article from the ''Journal of the American Institute of Conservation'' describes using [[infrared spectroscopy]] to identify shellac coating on a 16th-century cassone.<ref name="JAIC Cassone">{{cite journal

== Uses ==
=== Historical ===
In the early- and mid-twentieth century, orange shellac was used as a one-product finish (combination stain and varnish-like topcoat) on decorative wood panelling used on walls and ceilings in homes, particularly in the US. In the [[American South]], use of knotty [[pine]] plank [[panelling]] covered with orange shellac was once as common in new construction as [[drywall]] is today. It was also often used on kitchen cabinets and hardwood floors, prior to the advent of [[polyurethane]].{{Cn|date=January 2021}}

Shellac was used from the mid-nineteenth century to produce small moulded goods such as [[picture frame]]s, [[box]]es, toilet articles, [[jewelry]], [[inkwell]]s and even [[dentures]]. Advances in [[plastics]] have rendered shellac obsolete as a moulding compound.{{Cn|date=January 2021}}

Shellac (both orange and white varieties) was used both in the field and laboratory to glue and stabilise dinosaur bones until about the mid-1960s. While effective at the time, the long-term negative effects of shellac (being organic in nature) on dinosaur bones and other fossils is debated, and shellac is very rarely used by professional conservators and fossil preparators today.{{Cn|date=January 2021}}

Shellac was used for fixing [[inductor]], [[Electric motor|motor]], [[Electrical generator|generator]] and [[transformer]] windings. It was applied directly to single-layer windings in an alcohol solution. For multi-layer windings, the whole coil was submerged in shellac solution, then drained and placed in a warm place to allow the alcohol to evaporate. The shellac locked the wire turns in place, provided extra insulation, prevented movement and vibration and reduced buzz and hum. In motors and generators it also helps transfer force generated by magnetic attraction and repulsion from the windings to the rotor or [[armature (electrical engineering)|armature]]. In more recent times, shellac has been replaced in these applications by synthetic resins such as [[polyester resin]]. Some applications use shellac mixed with other natural or synthetic resins, such as [[pine resin]] or phenol-formaldehyde resin, of which [[Bakelite]] is the best known, for electrical use. Mixed with other resins, [[barium sulfate]], [[calcium carbonate]], [[zinc sulfide]], [[aluminium oxide]] and/or cuprous carbonate ([[malachite]]), shellac forms a component of heat-cured capping cement used to fasten the caps or bases to the bulbs of electric lamps.{{Cn|date=January 2021}}

Shellac is an odour and stain blocker and so is often used as the base of "solves all problems" primers. Although its durability against abrasives and many common solvents is not very good, shellac provides an excellent barrier against water vapour penetration. Shellac-based primers are an effective sealant to control odours associated with fire damage.{{Cn|date=January 2021}}

Shellac has traditionally been used as a dye for cotton and, especially, silk cloth in Thailand, particularly in the north-eastern region.<ref name="Suanmuang Tulaphan, Phunsap, Silk Dyeing With Natural Dyestuffs in Northeastern Thailand, 1999, p. 26-30 (in Thai).">Suanmuang Tulaphan, Phunsap, ''Silk Dyeing With Natural Dyestuffs in Northeastern Thailand'', 1999, p. 26-30 (in Thai)</ref> It yields a range of warm colours from pale yellow through to dark orange-reds and dark ochre.<ref name="Punyaprasop, Daranee (Ed.)Colour And Pattern On Native Cloth, 2001, p. 253, 256 (in Thai).">Punyaprasop, Daranee (Ed.)Colour ''And Pattern On Native Cloth'', 2001, p. 253, 256 (in Thai)</ref> Naturally dyed silk cloth, including that using shellac, is widely available in the rural northeast, especially in [[Ban Khwao District]], [[Chaiyaphum province]].

====Wood finish====

Wood finishing is one of the most traditional and still popular uses of shellac mixed with solvents or alcohol. This dissolved shellac liquid, applied to a piece of wood, is an evaporative finish: the alcohol of the shellac mixture evaporates, leaving behind a protective film.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Woodworking Tools and Techniques: An Introduction to Basic Woodworking|last=Marshall|first=Chris|publisher=Creative Publishing International, US|year=2004|pages=137}}</ref>

Shellac as wood finish is natural and non-toxic in its pure form. A finish made of shellac is UV-resistant. For water-resistance and durability, it does not keep up with synthetic finishing products.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thediyhammer.com/shellac-vs-polyurethane-vs-varnish-wood-finishing-faqs/|title=Wood Finishing FAQs: Shellac vs. Polyurethane vs. Varnish|website=TheDIYhammer|access-date=4 August 2019}}</ref>

Because it is compatible with most other finishes, shellac is also used as a barrier or primer coat on [[wood]] to prevent the bleeding of [[resin]] or [[pigments]] into the final finish, or to prevent [[wood stain]] from blotching.<ref name="WoodworkDetails.com2">Shellac, [http://www.woodworkdetails.com/knowledge/finishing/shellac WoodworkDetails.com: Shellac as a Woodworking Finish]{{Circular reference|date=March 2015}}</ref>
