==Early life and career==
Etheridge was born in [[Leavenworth, Kansas]], the younger of two daughters of Elizabeth (Williamson), a computer consultant, and John Etheridge, an [[American Constitution]] teacher at her alma mater, [[Leavenworth High School]]. John Etheridge died in August 1991.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/melissa-etheridge-takes-the-long-hard-road-from-the-heartland-to-hollywood-64105/ |title=Melissa Etheridge Takes the Long Hard Road from the Heartland to Hollywood|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=July 28, 2019}}</ref>

Etheridge began guitar lessons aged eight.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-11-18|title=‘I considered having kids with Brad Pitt’: Melissa Etheridge on music, motherhood and coming out|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/18/melissa-etheridge-music-motherhood-coming-out-brad-pitt|access-date=2021-11-22|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref> She started to play in local country music groups in her teenage years and graduated from high school in 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/analysis/pieces-of-her-heart-183941.html|title=Pieces of her heart|date=February 16, 2012|website=Irishexaminer.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.leavenworthtimes.com/article/20101012/NEWS/310129861|title=Leavenworth's own Melissa Etheridge lets us .... inside her window|first=Dale|last=Brendel|website=The Leavenworth Times - Leavenworth, KS}}</ref> While attending college at [[Berklee College of Music]], Etheridge played the club circuit around [[Boston]]. After three semesters, Etheridge decided to drop out of Berklee and move to Los Angeles to attempt a career in music.<ref name="All Music" />

==Career==
===1982–1992: Road to rock stardom===
Etheridge was discovered at Vermie's, a bar in Pasadena, California. She had made some friends on a women's soccer team, and those new friends came to see her play. One of the women was Karla Leopold, whose husband, Bill Leopold, was a manager in the music business. Karla convinced Bill to see Etheridge perform live. He was impressed, and became a pivotal part of Etheridge's career.<ref name=autobiography>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5_4DEtjV0vcC&q=carla+leopold+%2B+etheridge&pg=PA72|title=The Truth Is ...: My Life in Love and Music|last1=Etheridge|first1=Melissa|last2=Morton |first2=Laura|year=2002|edition=2nd|publisher=Random House|location=New York|page=72|isbn=978-0-307-76564-2}}</ref>  This, in addition to her gigs in lesbian bars around Los Angeles, led to her discovery by [[Island Records]] chief Chris Blackwell. She signed a publishing deal to write songs for films including the 1986 movie ''[[Weeds (1987 film)|Weeds]]''.<ref name="CMT.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/melissa-etheridge|title=Melissa Etheridge|author=cmt.com|publisher=MTV Networks|access-date=September 7, 2017}}</ref>

After an unreleased first effort that was rejected by Island Records as being too polished and glossy, she completed her stripped-down, self-titled debut in just four days. Her eponymous debut album ''[[Melissa Etheridge (album)|Melissa Etheridge]]'' (1988), was an underground hit, and the single "[[Bring Me Some Water]]" performed well on radio and was nominated for a Grammy Award.<ref name="CMT.com" />

At the time of the album's release, it was not generally known that Etheridge was a lesbian. While on the road promoting the album, she paused in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], to be interviewed for the syndicated radio program ''Pulsebeat—Voice of the Heartland'', explaining the intensity of her music by saying: "People think I'm really sad—or really angry. But my songs are written about the conflicts I have...I have no anger toward anyone else."<ref>Dickerson, James L. (2005) "Go, Girl, Go! The Women's Revolution in Music," Schirmer Trade Books, p. 115.</ref> She invited the radio syndication producer to attend her concert that night. He did and was surprised to find himself one of the few men in attendance.<ref>Dickerson, James L. (2005) "Go, Girl, Go! The Women's Revolution in Music," Schirmer Trade Books, p. 114.</ref>

Etheridge's second album, ''[[Brave and Crazy]]'', was released in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/brave-and-crazy-mw0000201739|title=Brave and Crazy - Melissa Etheridge &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic}}</ref> ''Brave and Crazy'' followed the same musical formula as her eponymous debut; it also garnered a Grammy nomination. The album peaked at No. 22 on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] (equal to her first album). Etheridge then went on the road, like one of her musical influences, [[Bruce Springsteen]], and built a loyal fan base.<ref name="Biography.com" />

In 1992, Etheridge released her third album, ''[[Never Enough (Melissa Etheridge album)|Never Enough]]''. Similar to her prior two albums, ''Never Enough'' didn't reach the top of the charts peaking at #21 but gave Etheridge her first Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female]] for her single "Ain't It Heavy". ''Never Enough'' was considered a more personal and mature album from Etheridge at that time. With rumors circulating around her sexuality (Etheridge was not out yet at this point), the album seemed to inadvertently address these rumors.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|last=Loftus|first=Johnny|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r6883|pure_url=yes}}|title=Never Enough – Melissa Etheridge|website=AllMusic|date=March 17, 1992|access-date=May 18, 2012}}</ref>

In 1992, Etheridge established a performing arts scholarship at Leavenworth High School in honor of her recently deceased father. According to Etheridge, her father purchased her first guitar and "would come with me to bars in the area when I played because I was underage".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deseret.com/1992/5/20/18984888/scholarship-venerates-memory-of-singer-s-dad|title=SCHOLARSHIP VENERATES MEMORY OF SINGER'S DAD|first=Deseret|last=News|date=May 20, 1992|website=Deseret News}}</ref>

===1993–1995: ''Yes I Am''===

[[File:Melissa Etheridge concert ticket - 1995 - Stierch.jpg|thumbnail|Melissa Etheridge concert ticket, 1995]]
The success of ''Yes I Am'' helped increase sales of Etheridge's earlier albums. In 1995, ''Melissa Etheridge'' earned a [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] certification of 2× platinum,<ref name=riaa /> while ''Never Enough'' earned a [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] certification of platinum.<ref name=riaa />

Etheridge's follow-up to ''Yes I Am'' was the moderately successful ''[[Your Little Secret]]'' (1995). The album was not as well received by critics as Etheridge's prior recordings. Featuring a lead single of the same name, ''[[Your Little Secret]]'' is the highest-charting album of Etheridge's career, having reached No. 6 on the ''Billboard'' album charts; however, the album spent only 41 weeks on the chart. The album produced two Top 40 singles "[[I Want to Come Over]]" (''Billboard'' #22, ''RPM'' #1) and "Nowhere to Go" (''Billboard'' #40) and earned a [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] certification of 2× platinum.<ref name="riaa" />

===1996–2003: After her breakthrough===
In 1996, Etheridge won an ASCAP Songwriter of the Year award. She also took a lengthy break from the music business to concentrate on her family when her first two children Bailey (1997) and Beckett (1998) were born.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parents.com/parenting/dynamics/gay-parents/melissa-etheridge-sperm-donation-lgbtq-parenting/|title=Melissa Etheridge Speaks Candidly About the Intricacies of LGBTQ Parenting|website=Parents.com|access-date=November 11, 2020}}</ref><ref name="CMT.com" /> She also recorded "Sin Tener A Donde Ir (Nowhere to Go)" for the [[AIDS]] benefit album ''[[Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Etheridge returned to the music charts with the release of ''[[Breakdown (Melissa Etheridge album)|Breakdown]]''  in October 1999. ''Breakdown'' peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard charts and spent 18 weeks in the charts. Despite this, ''Breakdown''  was the only album of Etheridge's career to be nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album]] (losing to [[Santana (band)|Santana]]'s ''[[Supernatural (Santana album)|Supernatural]]''). In addition, her single "Angels Would Fall" was nominated in two categories: [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female]] (losing to [[Sheryl Crow]]) and [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song|Best Rock Song]] (losing to the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]) in 2000.

The album was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name="riaa" />

The year 2001 saw the release of ''[[Skin (Melissa Etheridge album)|Skin]]'', an album she described as "the closest I've ever come to recording a concept album. It has a beginning, middle and end. It's a journey." ''Skin'' garnered generally positive reviews with Metacritic scoring the album 73/100 from 9 reviews.<ref name="Metacritic">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/skin/melissa-etheridge|title=Metacritic review of ''Skin''|author=Metacritic.com|access-date=September 7, 2017}}</ref> Recorded after her breakup with partner Julie Cypher, ''Skin'' was described as "[a] harrowing, clearly autobiographical dissection of a decaying relationship." Despite positive reviews, ''Skin'' sold less than 500,000 copies. On the Billboard charts, it peaked at No. 9 but dropped out of the Top 200 after just 12 weeks. The single "[[I Want to Be in Love]]" was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female]] (losing to [[Lucinda Williams]]). The music video for the song starred [[Jennifer Aniston]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHBN_4PRYBo| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211103/pHBN_4PRYBo| archive-date=2021-11-03 | url-status=live|title=Melissa Etheridge – I Want To Be In Love|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=October 8, 2009|access-date=July 27, 2014}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

===2004–2008: ''Lucky'', cancer diagnosis, Academy Awards and ''The Awakening''===
Etheridge began 2004 with the release of her eighth album ''[[Lucky (Melissa Etheridge album)|Lucky]]'' on February 10. Etheridge was now in a new relationship with actress [[Tammy Lynn Michaels]], whom she had begun dating in 2001. ''Lucky'' performed similarly to ''Skin'', selling fewer than 500,000 copies, peaking on the Billboard charts at No. 15 and spending 13 weeks on the charts. It also garnered a Grammy nomination for Etheridge's cover of the [[Greenwheel]] song "Breathe" for the [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Solo]] (losing to [[Bruce Springsteen]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

In October 2004, Etheridge was diagnosed with breast cancer. At the [[2005 Grammy Awards]] (the same ceremony for which "Breathe" was nominated), she made a return to the stage and, although bald from chemotherapy, performed a tribute to [[Janis Joplin]] with the song "[[Piece of My Heart]]".
