'''Paul John Weller''' (born '''John William Weller'''; 25 May 1958) is an English singer-songwriter and musician. Weller achieved fame with the [[punk rock]]/[[New wave music|new wave]]/[[mod revival]] band [[The Jam]] (1972–1982). He had further success with the [[blue-eyed soul]] music of [[the Style Council]] (1983–1989), before establishing himself as a solo artist with his [[Paul Weller (album)|eponymous 1992 album]].

Despite widespread critical recognition as a singer, lyricist, and guitarist, Weller has remained a national, rather than international, star and much of his songwriting is rooted in [[English society]]. Many of his songs with the Jam had lyrics about [[working class]] life.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.irishnews.com/arts/2018/09/14/news/paul-weller-divided-britain-is-just-another-tool-of-this-hopeless-tory-government-1431078/ | title= Paul Weller: 'Divided Britain' is just another tool of this hopeless Tory government | work=[[The Irish News]] | first=Andrew | last=Arthur | date=14 September 2018 | access-date=29 August 2020}}</ref> He was the principal figure of the 1970s and 1980s [[mod revival]], often referred to as "The Modfather",<ref>{{cite news |last=Sandall |first=Robert |date=2 September 2007 |title=The modfather returns |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-modfather-returns-mlq2k7mrz8k |newspaper=The Sunday Times |location=London |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120031525/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article2347958.ece |archive-date=20 November 2008 |access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Davet |first=Stéphane |date=14 July 2010 |title=Paul Weller, héros distingué et toujours en colère du rock britannique |url=https://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2010/07/14/paul-weller-heros-distingue-et-toujours-en-colere-du-rock-britannique_1387837_3246.html |newspaper=Le Monde.fr |location=Paris |trans-title=Paul Weller, elder statesman of British rock – but still angry |language=fr |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714212948/https://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2010/07/14/paul-weller-heros-distingue-et-toujours-en-colere-du-rock-britannique_1387837_3246.html |archive-date=14 July 2010 |access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref> and an influence on [[Britpop]] bands such as [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]].<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7387641&t=1598698211008 | title= Paul Weller: A Britpop Titan Lives On | work=[[NPR]] | first=David | last=Dye | date=13 February 2007 | access-date=29 August 2020}}</ref>

==Early life (1958–1975)==
Weller was born on 25 May 1958 in [[Woking]], [[Surrey]], England, to John and Ann Weller (née Craddock). Although born John William Weller, he became known as Paul by his parents.<ref name=Perrone>{{Cite news |first=Pierre |last=Perrone |title=John Weller: Father of Paul Weller who managed his son for 30 years |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/john-weller-father-of-paul-weller-who-managed-his-son-for-30-years-1674817.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430141158/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/john-weller-father-of-paul-weller-who-managed-his-son-for-30-years-1674817.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 April 2009 |work=The Independent |location=London |date=27 April 2009 }}

His father worked as a taxi driver and a builder and his mother was a part-time cleaner.<ref>{{Cite book |first=John |last=Reed |title=My Ever Changing Moods: Fully Revised and Updated|year=2002 |page=24 |publisher=Omnibus Press |isbn=0-7119-8866-8}}</ref> Weller started his education at Maybury County First School in 1963. His love of music began with [[The Beatles]], then [[The Who]] and [[Small Faces]]. By the time Weller was eleven and moving up to [[Sheerwater Secondary School|Sheerwater County Secondary]] school, music was the biggest part of his life, and he had started playing the guitar.

Weller's musical vocation was confirmed after seeing [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] in concert in 1972.<ref name=quo>
{{cite news |first=Jonathan|last=Owen|title=50 years of Quo&nbsp;– and still no fourth chord |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/50-years-of-quo--and-still-no-fourth-chord-8210472.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=14 October 2012|access-date=13 March 2015}}
</ref>
He formed the first incarnation of The Jam in the same year, playing bass guitar with his best friends Steve Brookes (lead guitar) and Dave Waller (rhythm guitar). Weller's father, acting as their [[talent manager|manager]], began booking the band into local [[working men's club]]s. Joined by [[Rick Buckler]] on drums, and with [[Bruce Foxton]] soon replacing Waller<!--i.e. Dave Waller--> on rhythm guitar, the four-piece band began to forge a local reputation, playing a mixture of [[The Beatles|Beatles]] [[Cover version|covers]] and a number of compositions written by Weller and Brookes. Brookes left the band in 1976, and Weller and Foxton decided they would swap guitar roles, with Weller now the guitarist.

==The Jam (1976–1982)==
{{Main|The Jam}}
The Jam emerged at the same time as [[punk rock]] bands such as [[The Clash]], [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]], and [[Sex Pistols]]. The Clash emerged as leading early advocates of the band, and were sufficiently impressed to take them along as the support on their ''White Riot'' tour of 1977.

[[File:Thejam.gif|thumb|left|The Jam performing in Newcastle in 1982]]
The Jam's first single, "[[In the City (The Jam song)|In the City]]", took them into the [[UK Top 40]] in May 1977. Although every subsequent single had a placing within the Top 40, it was not until the group released the political "[[The Eton Rifles]]" that they would break into the [[Top 40|Top 10]], hitting the No.&nbsp;3 spot in November 1979. The increasing popularity of their blend of Weller's barbed lyrics with pop melodies eventually led to their first [[Chart-topper|number one]] single, "[[Going Underground]]", in March 1980.

"I like them a lot," remarked [[Peter Gabriel]], who enlisted Weller to play on [[Peter Gabriel (1980 album)|his third album]]. "They're one of the new groups who have written the best songs. They're really very good."<ref>''Best'' magazine, May 1978; translated in Gabriel fanzine ''White Shadow'' (#1, pp16) by editor Fred Tomsett</ref>

The Jam became the first band since the Beatles to perform both sides of the same single ("[[Town Called Malice]]" and "[[Precious (The Jam song)|Precious]]") on one edition of ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. They also had two singles, "[[That's Entertainment (The Jam song)|That's Entertainment]]" and "[[Just Who Is the 5 O'Clock Hero?]]", reach No.&nbsp;21 and No.&nbsp;8 respectively in the [[UK singles chart]] despite not even being released as singles in the UK&nbsp;– they got there purely on the strength of the huge number of people buying import sales of the German and Dutch single releases. The Jam still hold the record for the best-selling import-only singles in the UK charts.

As the band's popularity increased, however, Weller became restless and wanted to explore a more soulful, melodic style of music with a broader instrumentation, and in consequence in 1982 he announced that The Jam would disband at the end of that year. The action came as a surprise to Foxton and Buckler who both felt that the band was still a creative formation with scope to develop further professionally, but Weller was determined to end the band and move on. Their final single, "[[Beat Surrender]]", became their fourth UK chart topper, going straight to No.&nbsp;1 in its first week. Their farewell concerts at [[Wembley Arena]] were multiple sell-outs; their final concert took place at the [[Brighton Centre]] on 11 December 1982.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.modculture.co.uk/the-jam-december-11th-1982-by-simon-wells/|title=The Jam: December 11th 1982 by Simon Wells - Modculture|date=6 September 2011|work=Modculture|access-date=21 November 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>

==The Style Council (1983–1989)==
{{Main|The Style Council}}
At the beginning of 1983, Weller teamed up with keyboard player [[Mick Talbot]] to form a new group called [[The Style Council]]. Weller brought in [[Steve White (drummer)|Steve White]] to play drums, as well as singer [[Dee C. Lee]], who was later to become Weller's girlfriend and then wife. She also had previously been a backing singer with [[Wham!]]

Free of the limited musical styles he felt imposed by [[The Jam]], under the collective of The Style Council Weller was able to experiment with a wide range of music, from pop and [[jazz]] to Soul/[[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], house and folk-styled [[ballads]]. The band was at the vanguard of a jazz/pop revival that would continue with the emergence of bands like [[Matt Bianco]], [[Sade (band)|Sade]], and [[Everything but the Girl]], whose members [[Tracey Thorn]] and [[Ben Watt]] contributed vocals and guitar to the 1984 The Style Council song "Paris Match".

Many of The Style Council's early singles performed well in the charts, and Weller would also experience his first success in North America, when "My Ever Changing Moods" and "You're The Best Thing" entered the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. In Australia it was far more successful than The Jam, reaching the top of the charts in 1984 with "Shout to the Top".

Weller appeared on 1984's [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] record "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]" and was called upon to mime the absent [[Bono]]'s lyrics on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. The Style Council was the second act to appear in the British half of [[Live Aid]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in 1985.

In December 1984, Weller put together his own charity ensemble called The Council Collective to make a record, "Soul Deep", to raise money for [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)|striking miners]], and the family of [[Killing of David Wilkie|David Wilkie]]. The record featured The Style Council plus a number of other performers, notably [[Jimmy Ruffin]] and [[Junior Giscombe]]. In spite of the song's political content, it still picked up [[BBC Radio 1]] airplay and was performed on ''Top of the Pops'', which led to the incongruous sight of lyrics such as "We can't afford to let the government win / It means death to the trade unions" being mimed amid the show's flashing lights and party atmosphere.

As the 1980s wore on, The Style Council's popularity in the UK began to slide, with the band achieving only one top ten single after 1985. The Style Council's death knell was sounded in 1989 when its record company refused to release its fifth and final studio album, the house-influenced ''[[Modernism: A New Decade]]''. With the rejection of this effort, Weller announced that The Style Council had split. It wasn’t until the 1998 retrospective CD box set ''The Complete Adventures of The Style Council'' that the album would be widely available.

==Solo career==
===Early solo career (1990–1995)===
In 1989, Weller found himself without a band and without a recording deal for the first time since he was 17.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|pages=1243/4}}</ref> After taking time off for most of 1990, he returned to the road late in the year, touring as "The Paul Weller Movement" with long-term drummer and friend Steve White and Paul Francis (session bassist from The James Taylor Quartet).<ref name="Larkin"/> After a slow start playing small clubs with a mixture of Jam/Style Council classics as well as showcasing new material such as "Into Tomorrow", by the time of the release of his 1992 LP, ''[[Paul Weller (album)|Paul Weller]]'', he had begun to re-establish himself as a leading British singer-songwriter. This self-titled album saw a return to a more jazz-guitar-focused sound, featuring [[sampling (music)|samples]] and a [[Funk music|funk]] influence with shades of the Style Council sound. The album also featured a new producer, [[Brendan Lynch (music producer)|Brendan Lynch]]. Tracks such as "Here's a New Thing" and "That Spiritual Feeling" were marketed among the emerging [[acid jazz]] scene.

Buoyed by the positive commercial and critical success of his first solo album, Weller returned to the studio in 1993 with a renewed confidence.<ref name="Larkin"/> Accompanied by Steve White, guitarist [[Steve Cradock]] and bassist Marco Nelson, the result of these sessions was the triumphant [[Mercury Music Prize]]-nominated ''[[Wild Wood]]'', which included "[[Sunflower (Paul Weller song)|Sunflower]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchesterwired.co.uk/news.php/75781-Paul-Weller-heads-up-Mercury-prize-nominations|title=Paul Weller heads up Mercury Prize nominations|website=Manchesterwired.co.uk|access-date=30 January 2011|date=20 July 2010}}</ref>

His 1995 album ''[[Stanley Road]]'' took him back to the top of the British charts for the first time in a decade, and went on to become the best-selling album of his career. The album, named after the street in Woking where he had grown up, marked a return to the more guitar-based style of his earlier days.<ref name="Larkin"/> The album's major single, "[[The Changingman]]", was also a big hit, taking Weller to No.&nbsp;7 in the UK Singles Chart. Another single, the ballad "You Do Something To Me", was his second consecutive Top 10 single and reached No.&nbsp;9 in the UK.

Weller found himself heavily associated with the emerging [[Britpop]] movement that gave rise to such bands as Oasis, [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]] and [[Blur (band)|Blur]]. [[Noel Gallagher]] (of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]) is credited as guest guitarist<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Paul-Weller-Stanley-Road/release/876015 |title=Paul Weller&nbsp;– Stanley Road (CD, Album) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |access-date=31 October 2011}}</ref> on the ''Stanley Road'' album track "I Walk on Gilded Splinters". Weller also returned the favour, appearing as a guest guitarist and backing vocalist on Oasis' hit song "[[Champagne Supernova]]".

===The Modfather (1996–2007)===
[[File:Weller v fest 25.jpg|thumb|Weller performing at [[V Festival]] in 2006]]
''[[Heavy Soul (Paul Weller album)|Heavy Soul]]'', the follow-up to the million-selling ''Stanley Road'', saw Weller twist his sound again. The album was more raw than its predecessor; Weller was now frequently playing live in the studio in as few takes as possible.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The first single "Peacock Suit" reached No.&nbsp;5 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], and the album reached No.&nbsp;2. Success in the charts also came from compilations: "Best Of" albums by The Jam and The Style Council charted, and in 1998 his own solo collection ''Modern Classics'' was a substantial success.

In 2000, while living in [[Send, Surrey]], he released his fifth solo studio album, ''[[Heliocentric (Paul Weller album)|Heliocentric]]''. Once again finding himself without a record contract, Weller's ''[[Days of Speed]]'' worldwide tour provided him with the opportunity to view his works as one back catalogue, giving rise to a second successful live album in 2001. ''Days of Speed'' contained live acoustic versions from the world tour of the same name, including some of his best-known songs from his solo career and the back catalogues of his The Jam and The Style Council days.

There were rumours at the time that ''Heliocentric'' would be Weller's final studio effort, but these proved unfounded when he released the No.&nbsp;1 hit album ''[[Illumination (Paul Weller album)|Illumination]]'' in September 2002. Co-produced by [[Noonday Underground]]'s Simon Dine, it was preceded by yet another top 10 hit single "It's Written in the Stars". Weller also appears on the 2002 Noonday Underground album called ''Surface Noise'', singing on the track "I'll Walk Right On".

In 2002, Weller collaborated with [[Terry Callier]] on the single "Brother to Brother", which featured on Callier's album ''Speak Your Peace''. In 2003, Weller teamed up with [[electronic rock]] duo [[Death in Vegas]] on a cover of [[Gene Clark]]'s "So You Say You Lost Your Baby", which featured on their ''[[Scorpio Rising (Death in Vegas album)|Scorpio Rising]]'' album.

In 2004, Weller released an album of covers entitled ''[[Studio 150]]''. It debuted at No.&nbsp;2 in the UK charts and included [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[All Along the Watchtower]]" as well as covers of songs by [[Gil Scott-Heron]], [[Rose Royce]] and [[Gordon Lightfoot]], amongst others.

Weller's 2005 album ''[[As Is Now]]'' featured the singles "From The Floorboards Up", "Come On/Let's Go" and "Here's The Good News". The album was well-received, though critics noted that he was not moving his music forward stylistically,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/paul-weller/as-is-now.htm|title=Paul Weller&nbsp;– As Is Now Review|access-date=30 January 2011|date=16 December 2005}}</ref> and it became his lowest-charting album since his 1992 [[Paul Weller (album)|debut]].

In February 2006 it was announced that Weller would be the latest recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award at the [[BRIT Awards]]. Despite a tendency to shun such occasions, Weller accepted the award in person, and performed four songs at the ceremony, including The Jam's classic "Town Called Malice". In June 2006, another double live album titled ''[[Catch-Flame!]]'', featuring songs from both his solo work and his career with The Jam and The Style Council, was released. In late 2006, the album ''[[Hit Parade (Paul Weller album)|Hit Parade]]'' was released, which collected all the singles released by The Jam, The Style Council and Weller during his solo career. Two versions of this album were released: a single disc with a selection from each stage of his career, and a four-disc [[limited edition]], which included every single released and came with a 64-page booklet. Weller was offered appointment as a Commander of the [[Order of British Empire]] in the 2006 birthday honours, but rejected the offer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/paul-weller/25851|title=Paul Weller rejected a CBE|access-date=7 February 2011|date=16 January 2007}}</ref>

In 2007 Weller was guest vocalist on the album issue by the folk musical project [[The Imagined Village]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://imaginedvillage.com/releases/|title=Releases|publisher=The Imagined Village|access-date=21 December 2016}}</ref>

===Critical success (2008–present)===
The double album ''[[22 Dreams]]'' was released on 2 June 2008, with "Echoes Round The Sun" as the lead single. Weller had parted company with his existing band before the recording this album, replacing everyone except guitarist [[Steve Cradock]] with Andy Lewis on bass, Andy Crofts of [[The Moons]] on keys and [[Steve Pilgrim (musician)|Steve Pilgrim]] of The Stands on drums. This album saw Weller move in a more experimental direction, taking in a wide variety of influences including jazz, folk and tango as well as the pop-soul more associated with his [[Style Council]] days. Weller also featured on two songs from The Moons' album "Life on Earth", playing piano on "Wondering" and lead guitar on "Last Night on Earth".

Weller was the surprise recipient of the [[2009 BRIT Awards#The Awards|2009 BRIT award for "Best Male Solo Artist"]], which resulted in controversy when it was discovered that a suspiciously high number of bets had been placed for Weller to win the award, for which [[James Morrison (singer)|James Morrison]] was [[T4 (Channel 4)|T4]]'s favourite. It was reported that the bookmakers had lost £100,000 in the event, and that as a result would not be taking bets for the awards in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/paul-weller/42928 |title=Bookies lose £100,000 after Paul Weller BRIT Awards win 2 February 2009 |work=NME |location=UK  |date=20 February 2009 |access-date=31 October 2011}}</ref>
