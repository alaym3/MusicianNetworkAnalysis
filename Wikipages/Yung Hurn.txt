== Style and influence ==
Yung Hurn's early music was soon assigned by journalists to the [[cloud rap]] that was started in the [[United States]] at the end of the 2000s.<ref name="ARTE">{{cite web

In fact, in his first tracks, according to his own statements, he was inspired not only by the [[Horrorcore]] representatives and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] pioneers [[Three 6 Mafia]], but also by the Californian rapper [[Lil B]], who is often referred to as the founder of cloud rap.<ref>{{cite web

In a show of the music magazine ''Tracks'' by the TV station [[Arte]] about him and the [[Cologne]] cloud rapper [[LGoony]], Yung Hurn also said regarding his musical influences that he listens to [[Indie music|indie]] as well as "deep dirty [[techno]]" and [[psychedelic rock]]. 
Thus, [[Tame Impala]] or [[Falco (musician)|Falco]], but especially [[the Beatles]], had strongly influenced him. He can also be seen on the show with a record by [[Jimi Hendrix]].<ref name="ARTE" /><ref name=":0" />
 
Yung Hurn took a path away from pure hip-hop with the ''Love Hotel''-EP, which had been produced by [[DJ Stickle]] and announced in the context of the video premiere of the associated [[R&B]] track ''Rot''.<ref>{{cite web

On [[Valentine's Day]] the second track ''Diamant'' was released, a [[retro]] [[Pop music|pop]] song atypical for Yung Hurn without any rap interludes. The video in the style of the 1980s shows the song interpreted by the [[Love Hotel Band]], which includes Yung Hurn and the Berlin actor [[Lars Eidinger]].<ref>{{cite web
