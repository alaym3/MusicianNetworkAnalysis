==Early life==
Joan Marie Larkin was born on September 22, 1958, to James and Dorothy Larkin,<ref name="Rolling Stone"/> at [[Lankenau Medical Center|Lankenau Hospital]] in [[Wynnewood, Pennsylvania]], a suburb of [[Philadelphia]] (although some sources list her birth date as September 22, 1960, which is incorrect<ref name = "Rolling Stone2">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/joan-jett/biography |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031122121/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/joan-jett/biography |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 31, 2011 |title=Joan Jett Bio |work=Rolling Stone |access-date=December 22, 2016}}</ref>). She is the oldest of three children. Her father was an insurance salesman and her mother was a secretary.<ref name = "Rolling Stone"/> Her family was Protestant, attended church, and went to Sunday school, but were not strict in their religious beliefs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://joanjettbadrep.com/Interviews/2000/weekender.shtml |title=She Loves Rock 'N Roll |publisher=Bad Reputation Nation |access-date=December 3, 2015 |author=Bukowski, Rex}}</ref> In 1967, her family moved to [[Rockville, Maryland]], where she attended Randolph [[Middle school|Junior High]] and [[Wheaton High School]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ww2.gazette.net/gazette_archive/2000/200032/wheaton/news/21709-1.html|title=She loves rock 'n' roll|publisher=Gazette.net|date=August 9, 2000|access-date=June 2, 2015|author=Myerov, Joshua|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018135540/http://ww2.gazette.net/gazette_archive/2000/200032/wheaton/news/21709-1.html|archive-date=October 18, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Jett got her first guitar at the age of 13.<ref>{{cite web|title=Joan Jett Biography|work=Rolling Stone|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/joan-jett/biography|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031122121/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/joan-jett/biography|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 31, 2011|access-date=August 8, 2013}}</ref> She took some guitar lessons, but soon quit because the instructor kept trying to teach her folk songs.<ref>Tolinski, Brad. "Girl's Got Rhythm". Guitar World May 2015: 50–60. Web.</ref> Her family then moved to [[West Covina, California]], in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], providing Jett the opportunity to pursue her musical interests. Shortly after the move, her parents divorced and she changed her name to Joan Jett, because she thought it had more of a rock-star sound than her birth name (she has admitted in recent years that "Jett" was not actually her mother's maiden name, even though that is what she used to tell people).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6x52mADayHU&t=2252s| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211028/6x52mADayHU| archive-date=2021-10-28|title=Joan Jett: Times Talk|work=youtube.com|access-date=October 1, 2018|language=en-US}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

In Los Angeles, Jett's favorite night spot was [[Rodney Bingenheimer's English Disco]],<ref>''Crawdaddy!'', 1976</ref> a venue that provided the [[glam rock]] style she loved.<ref name="VH1" />

==Career==
=== The Runaways ===

Jett became a founding member of [[the Runaways]], alongside drummer [[Sandy West]]. After the brief tenure of singer and bass guitarist [[Michael Steele (musician)|Micki Steele]], [[Jackie Fox]], [[Lita Ford]], and [[Cherie Currie]] soon joined to complete the band, creating the classic lineup. While Currie initially fronted the band, Jett shared some lead vocals, played rhythm guitar, and wrote or co-wrote some of the band's material along with Ford, West, and Currie. This lineup recorded three albums, with ''[[Live in Japan (The Runaways album)|Live in Japan]]'' becoming one of the biggest-selling imports in US and UK history.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

The band toured around the world and became an opening act for [[Cheap Trick]], [[Ramones]], [[Van Halen]], and [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]]. They found success abroad, especially in Japan. While touring England with the Runaways in 1976, Jett first heard the song "[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]" when she saw Arrows perform it on their weekly UK television series ''[[Arrows (TV series)|Arrows]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29568083|title=Ten hits you may not know were cover versions|work=BBC News|access-date=April 2, 2015|date=October 14, 2014|last1=Paterson|first1=Colin}}</ref>

While the Runaways were popular in Europe, Asia, Australia, Canada, and South America, they could not garner the same level of success in the United States.<ref name="VH1"/><ref name="SPIN">{{cite news|title=Encore: Joan Jett Leaves Her Mark|work=Spin|date=March 2009|url=http://spin-cdnsrc.texterity.com/spin/200903/?pg=90&pm=1|access-date=March 11, 2010}}</ref> After Currie left the band, the band released two more albums with Jett handling the lead vocals: ''[[Waitin' for the Night]]'' and ''[[And Now... The Runaways]]''. Altogether, they produced five albums from 1975 until they disbanded in the spring of 1979.<ref>{{AllMusic|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|class=artist|id=p4612|tab=biography|label=Joan Jett biography}}</ref>

Soon after, Jett produced the [[Germs (band)|Germs]]' only album, ''[[(GI)]]''.<ref name="VH1"/>

In 2010, ''[[The Runaways (2010 film)|The Runaways]]'', a movie about Jett's band, was released, starring [[Kristen Stewart]] as Jett and [[Dakota Fanning]] as Currie.<ref name="VH1"/><ref name="imdb">{{cite news|title=The Runaways synopsis|publisher=Internet Movie Database|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1017451/synopsis|access-date=March 11, 2010}}</ref><!-- What about the notorious manager? Wasn't he the one that found and wanted Cherie Currie as the frontwoman as she was a blonde? -->

===Solo career===
In 1979, Jett was in England pursuing a solo career. She recorded three songs there with the [[Sex Pistols]]' [[Paul Cook]] and [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]], one of which was an early version of [[Arrows (British band)|Arrows]]' "[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]". This version appears on the 1993 compilation album ''[[Flashback (Joan Jett album)|Flashback]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/feb10/articles/classictracks_0210.htm|title=Joan Jett 'I Love Rock and Roll' Classic Tracks|date=October 1, 1970|work=Sound on Sound|access-date=November 8, 2013}}</ref> Later that year, she returned to Los Angeles, where she began fulfilling an obligation of the Runaways to complete a film that was loosely based on the band's career entitled ''We're All Crazee Now!'' Three actresses stood in for the departed band members, including [[Rainbeaux Smith]], who was also a rock drummer.<ref name=MTV/> While working on the project, Jett met songwriter and producer [[Kenny Laguna]], who was hired by Toby Mamis to help Jett with writing some [[Soundtrack|tracks for the film]].<ref name=MTV>{{cite web|publisher=MTV|title=Kenny Laguna|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/kenny-laguna/biography/|access-date=April 18, 2014}}</ref> They became friends and decided to work together and Jett relocated to [[Long Beach, New York]], where Laguna was based. The plug was pulled on the project halfway through shooting after Jett fell ill, but in 1984, after she became famous, producers looked for a way to use the footage from the incomplete film.<ref name=MTV/> Parts of the original footage of Jett were eventually used in another project, an underground film called ''DuBeat-Eo'', which was produced by Alan Sacks, but not commercially released.<ref name=MTV/>

Jett and Laguna entered [[the Who]]'s [[Ramport Studios]] with the latter at the helm, and Jett's self-titled solo debut was released by [[Ariola Records]] in Europe on May 17, 1980. In the US, after the album was rejected by 23 major labels,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joanjett.com |title=Joan Jett and the Blackhearts|website=JoanJett.com|access-date=August 25, 2010}}</ref> Jett and Laguna released it independently on their new [[Blackheart Records]] label, which they started with Laguna's daughter's college savings. Laguna remembers, "We couldn't think of anything else to do but print up records ourselves."<ref name=MTV/>

With Laguna's assistance, Jett formed the Blackhearts. Laguna recounted, "I told Joanie to forget the band and support herself on the advance money. There was enough for her but not for a band. She said she had to have a band. And I believe to this day that it was the Blackhearts, that concept, that made Joan Jett."<ref name="Record8">{{cite journal|last=Gross|first=Jonathan| title=Joan Jett: The Road Goes On Forever|journal=Record|date=June 1983|volume=2|issue=8|pages=1, 10–11, 30}}</ref> She placed an ad in the ''[[LA Weekly]]'' stating that she was "looking for three good men".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Gleeson|first=Sinead|title=Year of the Jett|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]| date=June 18, 2010|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/theticket/2010/0618/1224272751486.html|quote=While trying to set up the band that would become the Blackhearts, she posted a classified ad "looking for three good men", and it's easy to assume that the Runaways experience had put her off being in an all-female band.|access-date=April 16, 2011}}</ref> [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]] of [[X (American band)|X]] sat in on bass for the auditions held at S.I.R. studios in Los Angeles.

Rik. He had been a fan of the Runaways and Jett for years. Jett recognized him at the audition and he was in. Ryan in turn recommended guitarist [[Eric Ambel]], who was also at the time part of Rik L. Rik. The final addition to the original Blackhearts was drummer Danny "Furious" O'Brien, formerly of the San Francisco band the [[Avengers (band)|Avengers]]. This lineup played several gigs at the [[Golden Bear (nightclub)|Golden Bear]], in Huntington Beach, California, and the [[Whisky a Go Go]] in Hollywood before embarking on their first European tour, which consisted of an extensive tour of the Netherlands and a few key shows in England, including the Marquee in London.<ref name="badrep">{{cite web| last=Jett|first=Joan|title=Joan Jett and the Blackhearts&nbsp;– An Open Forum with Joan Jett!|volume=2|website=Bad Reputation Nation|date=July 1992|issue=4|url=http://joanjettbadrep.com/Interviews/fanclub/Vol2Issue4.shtml|access-date=April 16, 2011}}</ref>

Laguna fired O'Brien at the end of the tour,<ref name="Record8"/> and upon returning to the States, Jett, Ryan, and Ambel moved to [[Long Beach, New York]]. Auditions were set up, and Lee Crystal, formerly of the Boyfriends and [[Sylvain Sylvain]], became the new drummer.<ref name="badrep"/> The band then toured throughout the US, slowly building a fan base, but struggling to remain financially afloat. Throughout 1980, the band was able to keep touring solely due to Laguna drawing on advances from outside projects.<ref name="Record8"/> Jett and Laguna used their personal savings to press copies of the ''Joan Jett'' album and set up their own system of distribution, sometimes selling the albums out of the trunk of Laguna's Cadillac at the end of each concert.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Siwek|first=Daniel|title=Joan Jett|newspaper=Music Connection Magazine|url=http://joanjettbadrep.com/cgi-bin/fullStory.cgi?archive=200610&story=20061001-05musicconnection.htm|access-date=April 7, 2011}}</ref> Laguna was unable to keep up with demand for the album. Eventually, old friend and founder of [[Casablanca Records]], [[Neil Bogart]], made a joint venture with Laguna and signed Jett to his new label, [[Boardwalk Records]] and re-released the ''Joan Jett'' album as ''[[Bad Reputation (Joan Jett album)|Bad Reputation]]''.

A spring 1981 concert at [[Palladium (New York City)|the Palladium]] in New York City proved to be a turning point. Described by music journalists as a career-defining performance by Jett, it helped solidify a strong New York following for Joan Jett & the Blackhearts.<ref name="Record8"/> After a year of touring and recording, the Blackhearts recorded a new album entitled ''[[I Love Rock 'n Roll (album)|I Love Rock 'n Roll]]'' for the label. Ambel was replaced by local guitarist [[Ricky Byrd]] during the recording.

===Ongoing work===
[[File:Joan Jett - 1994 - 02.jpg|right|thumb|Jett performing live at the [[Bumbershoot]] festival, in Seattle, Washington, 1994]]Jett returned to producing for the band [[Circus Lupus]] in 1992 and again, in 1994, for [[Bikini Kill]]. This recording was the ''[[Rebel Girl (Bikini Kill song)#Releases|New Radio +2]]'' vinyl 7-inch EP for which she also played and sang back-up vocals. The [[Riot Grrrl]] movement started in the 1990s, with Bikini Kill as a representative band, and many of these women credited Jett as a role model and inspiration.

In 1997, Jett was featured on the ''We Will Fall: The Iggy Pop Tribute'' album. She performed a cover of the [[Johnny O'Keefe]] song "[[Wild One (Johnny O'Keefe song)|Wild One]]" (or "Real Wild Child"). Jett worked with members of the punk rock band [[the Gits]], whose lead singer and lyricist, [[Mia Zapata]], had been raped and murdered in 1993.<ref name="VH1"/> The results of their collaboration was a live album, ''[[Evil Stig]]'' and a single, "Bob", whose earnings were contributed to the investigation of Zapata's murder. To this end, the band and Jett appeared on the television show ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'', appealing to the public for information. The case was solved in 2004, when Zapata's murderer, Jesus Mezquia, was brought to trial and convicted.

Jett is a guest artist on [[Marky Ramone and the Intruders]]' 1999 album ''The Answer to Your Problems?'' on the track "Don't Blame Me". She is a guest vocalist on [[Peaches (musician)|Peaches]]' album ''[[Impeach My Bush]]'' on the tracks "[[Boys Wanna Be Her]]" and "You Love It".

In 2005, Jett and Laguna signed punk rockers the Vacancies and produced their second album, ''A Beat Missing or a Silence Added'' (reaching the top 20 in CMJ Music Charts), and their third album in 2007, ''Tantrum''.

== Equipment ==
Jett's signature guitar is a white [[Gibson Melody Maker]], which she has played on all her hits since 1977. Jett bought her first Melody Maker from [[Eric Carmen]], following the breakup of the [[Raspberries (band)|Raspberries]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lespaulforum.com/forum/showthread.php?p=1646836|title=Joan Jett Melody Maker!!!|website=Lespaulforum.com|date=June 17, 2010|access-date=April 2, 2015}}</ref> In regards to her white Melody Maker, the singer once stated:

<blockquote>In [[The Runaways]] I was using a [[Gibson Les Paul|blond Les Paul]]. It's beautiful, and I still have it, but it's heavy as shit. I jump and run around a lot onstage, and it was really getting to my shoulder, so I was looking for a lighter guitar. I heard from one of our [[road crew]] that [[Eric Carmen]] from the [[Raspberries (band)|Raspberries]] was selling a Melody Maker, so I ended up buying it. Now, this is the guitar that he played on "Go All the Way" and all those [Raspberries] hits. And then I played it on "I Love Rock 'n' Roll", "Crimson and Clover", "Do You Want to Touch Me", "Bad Reputation" ...all those early records. Then I took it off the road because I got nervous that someone was gonna steal it or break it. It's so beautiful. It's white, has no stickers on it, and there are cracks in the paint and yellowing from age or club cigarettes. It's an unbelievable-looking guitar. I have it in a closet and I take it out occasionally to record. But I don't even need to use it to record anymore, because I have a guitar that sounds pretty much like it. I'm actually kind of afraid to bring out the original. It's got a great heritage. It's a guitar full of hits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/artists/dear-guitar-hero-joan-jett-talks-gibson-melody-makers-runaways-pre-show-jitters-and-more|title=Joan Jett Talks Gibson Melody Makers, the Runaways, Pre-Show Jitters and More|author=Brad Angle|website=Guitar WOrld|access-date=October 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ericcarmen.com/forums/index.php?/topic/31131-joan-jett-talks-erics-guitar/|title=Joan Jett Talks Eric's Guitar|website=EricCarmen.com|access-date=October 9, 2019}}</ref></blockquote>
