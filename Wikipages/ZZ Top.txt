'''ZZ Top'''{{efn|Pronounced "Zee Zee Top".}} is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 1969 in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]]. For 51 years, the band comprised vocalist-guitarist [[Billy Gibbons]], drummer [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] and vocalist-bassist [[Dusty Hill]], until Hill's death in 2021. Rooted in [[blues]], ZZ Top developed a signature sound based on Gibbons' blues guitar style and Hill and Beard's [[rhythm section]]. They are popular for their live performances, sly and humorous lyrics, and the similar appearances of Gibbons and Hill, who were rarely seen without their long beards, sunglasses, and hats.

ZZ Top formed after the demise of [[Moving Sidewalks]], Gibbons' previous band. Within a year, the members signed with [[London Records]] and released ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971). Subsequent releases, such as ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' (1973) and ''[[Fandango!]]'' (1975), and those albums' singles, "[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]" and "[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]", gained extensive radio airplay. By the mid-1970s the band became renowned in North America for its live act, highlighted by its performances during the [[Worldwide Texas Tour]] from 1976 to 1977, which was a critical and commercial success.

After a hiatus, ZZ Top returned in 1979 with a new musical direction and image, with Gibbons and Hill wearing sunglasses and matching chest-length beards. With the album ''[[El Loco]]'' (1981), the group began to experiment with [[synthesizer]]s and [[drum machine]]s. They established a more mainstream sound and gained international favor with ''[[Eliminator (album)|Eliminator]]'' (1983) and ''[[Afterburner (ZZ Top album)|Afterburner]]'' (1985), which integrated influences from [[New wave music|new wave]], [[Punk rock|punk]], and [[dance-rock]]. The popularity of these albums' music videos, including those for "[[Gimme All Your Lovin']]", "[[Sharp Dressed Man]]", and "[[Legs (song)|Legs]]", helped propel them onto the television channel [[MTV]] and made the band one of the more prominent artists in 1980s pop culture. The Afterburner Tour set records for the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour of 1986. After gaining additional acclaim with the release of their tenth album ''[[Recycler (album)|Recycler]]'' (1990) and its [[Recycler Tour|accompanying tour]], the group's experimentation continued with mixed success on the albums ''[[Antenna (ZZ Top album)|Antenna]]'' (1994), ''[[Rhythmeen]]'' (1996), ''[[XXX (ZZ Top album)|XXX]]'' (1999), and ''[[Mescalero (album)|Mescalero]]'' (2003). They most recently released ''[[La Futura]]'' (2012) and ''Goin' 50'' (2019), a compilation album commemorating the band's 50th anniversary. By the time of Hill's death in 2021, ZZ Top had become the longest-running band with an unchanged lineup in the history of popular music.<ref>{{cite web|first= Brett |last= Milano |title= Oldest Bands in Music: Acts That Defy the Laws of Age and Time |website= uDiscover Music |date= August 10, 2021 |access-date= August 20, 2021 |url= https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/oldest-bands-in-music-history/ |language= en-US}}</ref> Per Hill's wishes, he was replaced by their longtime [[guitar tech]] Elwood Francis on bass.

==History==
===Early years (1969–1972)===
The original line-up was formed in [[Houston]] and consisted of Gibbons, bassist/organist Lanier Greig,<ref name="HC">{{cite news|first= Andrew |last= Dansby |title= Greig, early ZZ Top member, dies at 64 |newspaper= [[Houston Chronicle]] |date= February 16, 2013 |access-date= July 28, 2014 |url= http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Lanier-Greig-musician-and-early-ZZ-Top-member-4284956.php}}</ref> and drummer Dan Mitchell.<ref name="HC"/> The name of the band was Gibbons' idea. The band had a small apartment covered with concert posters and he noticed that many performers' names used initials. Gibbons particularly noticed [[B.B. King]] and [[Z. Z. Hill]] and thought of combining the two into "ZZ King", but considered it too similar to the original name. He then figured that "king is going at the top" which brought him to "ZZ Top".<ref>{{cite web|title= Uncle Joe Benson – The Story: ZZ Top 9-11-15 The Stor |publisher= [[SoundCloud]] |access-date= September 13, 2015 |url= https://soundcloud.com/uncle-joe-benson/the-story-zz-top-9-11-15 |url-status= dead |archive-date= October 7, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151007205644/https://soundcloud.com/uncle-joe-benson/the-story-zz-top-9-11-15}}</ref>

ZZ Top was managed by [[Bill Ham]], a [[Waxahachie, Texas]], native who had befriended Gibbons a year earlier. They released their first single, "Salt Lick", in 1969, and the B-side contained the song "Miller's Farm". Both songs credited Gibbons as the composer. Immediately after the recording of "Salt Lick", Greig was replaced by bassist Billy Etheridge, a bandmate of [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and Mitchell was replaced by [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] of [[American Blues]]. Due to lack of interest from the major American record companies, ZZ Top accepted a record deal from [[London Records]], the American affiliate of the British [[Decca Records]] label. Unwilling to sign a recording contract, Etheridge quit the band and [[Dusty Hill]], Frank Beard's American Blues bandmate, became his replacement. After Hill moved from Dallas to Houston, ZZ Top signed with London in 1970. They performed their first concert together at the Knights of Columbus Hall in [[Beaumont, Texas]], on February 10, 1970.{{cn|date=July 2021}}

In addition to assuming the role as the band's leader, Gibbons became the main lyricist and musical arranger. With the assistance of Ham and engineer Robin Hood Brians, ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971) was released and exhibited the band's humor, with "barrelhouse" rhythms, distorted guitars, double entendres, and innuendo. The music and songs reflected ZZ Top's blues influences. Following their debut album, the band released ''[[Rio Grande Mud]]'' (1972), which produced their first charting single, "[[Francine (song)|Francine]]".<ref>{{cite web|first= Matthew |last= Wilkening |title= Revisiting ZZ Top's Second Album, 'Rio Grande Mud' |website= [[Ultimate Classic Rock]] |date= April 4, 2015 |access-date= June 5, 2019 |url= https://ultimateclassicrock.com/zz-top-rio-grande-mud-turns-40/}}</ref>

===First decade and signature sound (1973–1982)===
[[File:ZZ Top (1976).png|230px|thumb|right|ZZ Top performing live in 1976]]
ZZ Top released ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' in 1973, which reached the No. 8 position on the ''[[Billboard 200]]'' albums chart by early 1974. The album's sound was the result of the propulsive support provided by Hill and Beard, and Gibbons' "growling" guitar tone. Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that the album "brought ZZ Top their first Top Ten record, making them stars in the process". The album included the boogie-driven "[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]" (written about the [[Chicken Ranch (Texas)|Chicken Ranch]], a notorious brothel in [[La Grange, Texas]], that also inspired the musical ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]''). On the subsequent tour, the band performed sold-out concerts in the US. ZZ Top recorded the live tracks for one side of their 1975 album, ''[[Fandango!]]'', during this tour. ''Fandango!'', which also contained one side of new studio songs, was a top-ten album; its single "[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]" peaked at number 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

''[[Tejas (album)|Tejas]]'', released in 1976, was the final ZZ Top album under their contract with London Records. It was not as successful or as positively received as their previous efforts, but reached number 17 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Tejas – Awards |publisher= AllMusic |access-date= July 28, 2014 |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/tejas-mw0000193395/awards}}</ref> ZZ Top continued the [[Worldwide Texas Tour]] in support of ''Tejas'' through most of 1977.{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}

In 1976, after almost seven years of touring and a string of successful albums, ZZ Top went on hiatus for three years while Beard dealt with drug addiction.<ref name="DiPerna">{{cite magazine|first= Alan |last= di Perna |title= ZZ Top: Cars, Guitars, & Three Unlikely Rock Stars |date= July 2, 2008 |magazine= [[Guitar World]] |url= http://www.guitarworld.com/article/zz_top_cars_guitars_three_unlikely_rock_stars?page=0,8 |archive-date= October 30, 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081030192921/http://www.guitarworld.com/article/zz_top_cars_guitars_three_unlikely_rock_stars?page=0,8}}</ref> Gibbons traveled to Europe, Beard went to [[Jamaica]], and Hill went to [[Mexico]].<ref name="DiPerna"/> Hill also spent the period working at [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas Airport]], saying he wanted to "feel normal" and "ground himself" after years spent performing.<ref>{{cite web|first= Dave |last= Lifton |title= Why Dusty Hill Spent ZZ Top's '70s Hiatus Working at an Airport |website= Ultimate Classic Rock |date= August 31, 2019 |access-date= July 30, 2021 |url= https://ultimateclassicrock.com/dusty-hill-day-job/}}</ref> In 1979, when the group returned with the album ''[[Degüello]]'', Gibbons and Hill wore chest-length beards and sunglasses.

In 1979, ZZ Top signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]] and released the album ''[[Degüello]]''. While the album went platinum, it only reached number 24 on the ''Billboard'' chart.<ref>{{cite web|title= Degüello – Awards |publisher= AllMusic |access-date= July 28, 2014 |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/deg%C3%BCello-mw0000651021/awards}}</ref> The album produced two popular singles: "[[I Thank You (song)|I Thank You]]", a cover of the [[David Porter (musician)|David Porter]]/[[Isaac Hayes]] composition originally recorded by [[Sam & Dave]], and the band original "[[Cheap Sunglasses]]". The band remained a popular concert attraction and toured in support of ''Degüello''. In April 1980, ZZ Top made their first appearances in Europe, performing for the German music television show ''[[Rockpalast]]'', later released as Disk 1 of the 2009 DVD ''[[Double Down Live: 1980 & 2008]]''{{cn|date=October 2021}} and the [[BBC]] show ''[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title= ZZ Top - Old Grey Whistle Test Session (1980) |publisher= [[BBC Radio 2]] |date= April 1980 |access-date= October 11, 2021 |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00lb4zh}}</ref> The band shared the BBC's studio with English [[electronic music|electronic]] group [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]] (OMD), whom Gibbons felt "were great".<ref>{{cite book|first= Mike |last= West |year= 1982 |title= Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark |publisher= [[Omnibus Press]] |pages= 19, 42 |isbn= 0-7119-0149-X}}</ref> Inspired by OMD, ZZ Top introduced a jerky dancing style to their live show and began to experiment with [[synthesizer]]s,<ref name="braincells">{{cite magazine|first= Gary |last= Ryan |title= Does Rock 'n' Roll Kill Braincells?! – Andy McCluskey, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) |magazine= [[NME]] |date= October 14, 2019 |access-date= October 30, 2020 |url= https://www.nme.com/music-interviews/does-rock-n-roll-kill-braincells-andy-mccluskey-orchestral-manoeuvres-in-the-dark-omd-2556689}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|first= Tom |last= Breihan |title= ZZ Top's Dusty Hill Dead at 72 |magazine= [[Stereogum]] |date= July 28, 2021 |access-date= August 22, 2021 |url= https://www.stereogum.com/2155612/zz-tops-dusty-hill-dead-at-72/news/}}</ref> which featured prominently on the October 1981 album ''[[El Loco]]''.<ref>{{cite web|first= Joe |last= Bosso |title= Billy Gibbons talks ZZ Top: The Complete Studio Albums (1970-1990) |website= [[MusicRadar]] |date= June 3, 2013 |access-date= October 30, 2020 |url= http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/billy-gibbons-talks-zz-top-the-complete-studio-albums-1970-1990-575728/8/ |archive-date= July 12, 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140712094453/http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/billy-gibbons-talks-zz-top-the-complete-studio-albums-1970-1990-575728/8/}}</ref> The album peaked at number 17 on the ''Billboard'' chart, and featured the singles "[[Tube Snake Boogie]]", "[[Pearl Necklace (song)|Pearl Necklace]]", and "Leila".<ref>{{cite web|title= El Loco – Awards |publisher= AllMusic |access-date= July 28, 2014 |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/el-loco-mw0000197282/awards}}</ref>

===''Eliminator'', ''Afterburner'', and ''Recycler'' (1983–1991)===
[[File:ZZTop.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Hill and Gibbons in 1983]]
Gibbons pushed the band into a more modern direction for ''[[Eliminator (album)|Eliminator]]'', released in March 1983. The album featured two Top-40 singles ("[[Gimme All Your Lovin']]" and "[[Legs (song)|Legs]]"), and two additional [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Top Rock]] hits ("[[Got Me Under Pressure]]" and "[[Sharp Dressed Man]]"), with the extended dance mix of "Legs" peaking at number 13 on the [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Club Play Singles]] chart.<ref>{{cite web|title= Eliminator – Awards |publisher= AllMusic |access-date= July 28, 2013 |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/eliminator-mw0000192586/awards}}</ref> The album became a critical and commercial success, selling more than 10 million copies while peaking at No. 9 in the U.S. ''Billboard'' pop charts.<ref name="riaa">{{cite web|title= Gold & Platinum – ZZ Top |publisher= [[Recording Industry Association of America]] |access-date= August 22, 2021 |url= https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=zz+top&adv=SEARCH#search_section}}</ref> 

Several music videos from the album were in regular rotation on MTV, attracting many new fans. The band won their first [[MTV Video Music Award]]s in the categories of [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Group Video|Best Group Video]] for "Legs", and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction|Best Direction]] for "Sharp Dressed Man". The music videos were included in their ''[[Greatest Hits (ZZ Top DVD)|Greatest Hits]]'' video, which was later released on DVD and quickly went multi-platinum.<ref name="riaa"/>

''Eliminator'' retained Gibbons's signature guitar style while adding elements of [[New wave music|new wave music]]; electronic band [[Depeche Mode]] have been cited as an influence on the album.<ref>{{cite magazine|first= David |last= Fricke |author-link= David Fricke |title= Billy Gibbons: My Life in 15 Songs |magazine= [[Rolling Stone]] |date= November 10, 2015 |access-date= November 1, 2020 |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/billy-gibbons-my-life-in-15-songs-151784/sharp-dressed-man-1983-142974/}}</ref> To compose the songs, Gibbons worked closely with live-in engineer Linden Hudson at the band's rehearsal studio in Texas, setting a faster [[tempo]] with [[drum machine]]s and [[synthesizer]]s. The main recording sessions were once again supervised in Memphis by [[Terry Manning]] who collaborated with Gibbons to replace much of the contributions from Hill and Beard.<ref name="Blayney1994"/> Singer [[Jimi Jamison]] joined Manning to provide backing vocals for the album.<ref>{{cite news|first= Mitch |last= McCracken |title= Where are they now: Jimi Jamison of Survivor |newspaper= The Sun Times |date= November 20, 2009 |access-date= October 31, 2020 |url= http://www.thesuntimes.com/article/20091120/NEWS/311209981 |url-status= dead |archive-date= April 4, 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190404160555/https://www.thesuntimes.com/article/20091120/NEWS/311209981}}</ref> 

Stage manager David Blayney described how Hudson co-wrote much of the material on the album without receiving credit. The band recorded Hudson's song "Thug" without permission, finally paying him $600,000 in 1986 after he proved in court he held the copyright.<ref name="Blayney1994">{{cite book|first= David |last= Blayney |year= 1994 |title= Sharp Dressed Men |location= New York |publisher= [[Hachette Books|Hyperion]] |pages= 196–203 |isbn= 0-7868-8005-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first= Deborah |last= Frost |year= 1985 |title= ZZ Top - Bad and Worldwide |location= New York |publisher= Rolling Stone Press |isbn= 0020029500}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first= David |last= Sinclair |year= 1986 |title= Tres Hombres: The Story of ZZ Top |publisher= [[Virgin Books|Virgin]] |isbn= 0-86369-167-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|author= Staff |date= March 1987 |title= Who Writes the Songs? |magazine= [[Texas Monthly]] |volume= 15 |issue= 3 |page= 82 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6CkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA82}}</ref>

Despite selling fewer copies than ''Eliminator'', ''[[Afterburner (ZZ Top album)|Afterburner]]'' (1985) became ZZ Top's highest-charting album (No. 4 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' chart),<ref name="Afterburner">{{cite web|title= Afterburner – Awards |publisher= AllMusic |access-date= July 28, 2013 |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/afterburner-mw0000196478/awards}}</ref> with sales of five million copies.<ref name="riaa"/> All of the singles from ''Afterburner'' were Top-40 hits, with "Sleeping Bag" and "Stages" reaching number one on the Mainstream Rock chart.<ref name="Afterburner"/> The music video for "[[Velcro Fly]]" was choreographed by pop singer [[Paula Abdul]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Paula Abdul – Times Topics |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date= August 5, 2009 |access-date= December 19, 2010 |url= http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/paula_abdul/index.html}}</ref> In 1987, ZZ Top released ''[[The Six Pack (ZZ Top album)|The Six Pack]]'', a collection of their first five albums plus ''El Loco''. The albums were remixed with new drum and guitar effects for a more "contemporary" sound similar to ''Eliminator''.<ref>{{cite web|first= Stephen Thomas |last= Erlewine |title= ZZ Top – Six Pack |website= [[AllMusic]] |access-date= August 22, 2021 |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/six-pack-mw0000651365}}</ref>

''[[Recycler (ZZ Top album)|Recycler]]'', released in 1990, was ZZ Top's last studio album under contract with Warner Records. ''Recycler'' was also the last of a distinct sonic trilogy in the ZZ Top catalogue, marking a return towards a simpler guitar-driven blues sound with less synthesizer and pop bounce than the previous two albums. This move did not entirely suit the fan base that ''Eliminator'' and ''Afterburner'' had built up, and while ''Recycler'' did achieve platinum status, it never matched the sales of those albums. However, the single "[[My Head's in Mississippi]]" did reach No. 1 on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|''Billboard'' Album Rock Tracks]] chart that year.<ref>{{cite web|title= Mainstream Rock: Dec 08, 1990 |work= Billboard |date= November 28, 2013 |access-date= July 21, 2019 |url= http://www.billboard.com/biz/charts/1990-12-08/hot-mainstream-rock-tracks}}</ref>

===Return to guitar-driven sound (1992–2003)===
In 1992, Warner released ''ZZ Top's Greatest Hits'', along with a new [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]]-style cut, "Gun Love", and an [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]]-inflected video, "[[Viva Las Vegas (song)|Viva Las Vegas]]". In 1993, ZZ Top inducted a major influence, [[Cream (band)|Cream]], into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

In 1994, the band signed a $35 million deal with [[RCA Records]],<ref name="rockhonors">{{cite web|title= VH1 Rock Honors 2007 – Honorees |publisher= [[VH1]] |year= 2007 |access-date= December 19, 2010 |url= http://www.vh1.com/shows/events/rock_honors/_2007/honorees.jhtml |url-status= dead |archive-date= July 3, 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120703065056/http://www.vh1.com/shows/events/rock_honors/_2007/honorees.jhtml}}</ref> releasing the million-selling ''[[Antenna (ZZ Top album)|Antenna]]''. Subsequent RCA albums, ''[[Rhythmeen]]'' (1996) and 1999's ''[[XXX (ZZ Top album)|XXX]]'' (the second album to feature live tracks) sold well, but did not reach the levels enjoyed previously. In 2003, ZZ Top released a final RCA album, ''[[Mescalero (album)|Mescalero]]'', an album thick with harsh Gibbons guitar and featuring a [[hidden track]]—a cover version of "[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By.]]" RCA impresario Clive Davis wanted to do a collaboration record (in the mode of [[Carlos Santana]]'s successful ''Supernatural'') for this album.
