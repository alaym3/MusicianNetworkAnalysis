'''Man Man''' is an [[experimental music|experimental]] rock band from [[Philadelphia]] and now based in [[Los Angeles]]. Their multi-instrumental style is centered on the piano playing of lead singer, songwriter, and lyricist Honus Honus (Ryan Kattner).

He is accompanied by an energetic group of multi-instrumentalist musicians and vocalists. Instruments played by the band include [[clavinet]], [[Moog Little Phatty]], [[sousaphone]], [[saxophone]], [[trumpet]], [[French horn]], [[flute]], [[bass clarinet]], [[drum set]], [[euphonium]], [[Fender Jazz Bass]], [[Danelectro]] [[baritone guitar]], [[xylophone]], [[marimba]], [[melodica]] and various percussive instruments including pots and pans, toy noisemakers, Chinese funeral horns, spoons, smashing plates, and fireworks.

==History==
Man Man released their debut ''[[The Man in a Blue Turban with a Face]]'' in October 2004 on [[Ace Fu Records]], but did not begin to tour extensively until their follow-up album ''[[Six Demon Bag]]'' was released in 2006 to positive reviews. During 2007, the band opened for [[Modest Mouse]] on several U.S tours, gaining them further public attention. Not long afterward, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] began airing a series of commercials starring [[Rainn Wilson]] with Man Man's "10 lb Mustache" as the background music.<ref>[http://www.pastemagazine.com/action/article/6980/feature/music/catching_up_with_man_man]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608121909/http://www.pastemagazine.com/action/article/6980/feature/music/catching_up_with_man_man |date=June 8, 2008 }}</ref> "10 lb Mustache", "Feathers", and "Engrish Bwudd" were featured in season 3, episode 8 of the TV show ''[[Weeds (TV series)|Weeds]]''. The band also recorded a cover of "Little Boxes" for the title sequence of that episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stereogum.com/5806/the_shins_man_man_do_weeds/show-tunes/ |title=The Shins, Man Man Do Weeds |publisher=Stereogum |date=2007-07-09 |access-date=2014-02-15}}</ref>

Man Man released their third studio album ''[[Rabbit Habits]]'' on [[ANTI-]] in 2008, and embarked on a North American tour in March 2008, with [[Yeasayer]] and [[Tim Fite]] splitting dates. They performed at numerous festivals including [[Voodoo Experience]], [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]], [[Primavera Sound]], and the [[Meredith Music Festival]] that same year.

Man Man released their fourth album ''[[Life Fantastic]]'' in May 2011 with producer Mike Mogis (of [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]] and [[Monsters of Folk]] fame). The album featured a less "wacky" and more somber sound than previous releases. The first song written for the album "Steak Knives" was inspired by a failed relationship and the death of several close friends.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} It took Kattner (Honus Honus) over a year to write.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inflatableferret.com/interviews/interview-honus-honus-of-man-man/ |title=Interview: Honus Honus of Man Man |publisher=Inflatable Ferret |access-date=2014-02-15}}</ref>

In 2011 and 2017, Honus released albums with the indie supergroup [[Mister Heavenly]].

Man Man's fifth studio album, ''On Oni Pond'' was released on September 10, 2013. The album was again produced by Mike Mogis. The first single, "Head On", peaked at #32 on the Billboard [[Alternative Songs]] chart.

In 2015, Honus completed both a solo album and an album of children's music.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Man Man's Honus Honus Talks Mister Heavenly, Solo Record, and Writing Lyrics on the Walls|url = http://www.transversomedia.com/articles//man-mans-honus-honus-talks-mister-heavenly-solo-record-and-much-more|website = TRANSVERSO|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611144736/http://www.transversomedia.com/articles//man-mans-honus-honus-talks-mister-heavenly-solo-record-and-much-more|archive-date=June 11, 2017|access-date = May 5, 2019}}</ref> On November 4, 2016, Honus released his solo album, ''Use Your Delusion''.
