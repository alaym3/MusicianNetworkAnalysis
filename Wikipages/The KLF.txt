[[Bill Drummond]] (alias King Boy D) and [[Jimmy Cauty]] (alias Rockman Rock) began by releasing [[hip hop music|hip hop]]-inspired and [[sampling (music)|sample]]-heavy records as the JAMs. As the Timelords, they recorded the British number-one single "[[Doctorin' the Tardis]]", and documented the process of making a hit record in a book ''[[The Manual|The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)]]''. As the KLF, Drummond and Cauty pioneered [[The KLF films|stadium house]] (rave music with a pop-rock production and sampled crowd noise) and, with their 1990 LP ''[[Chill Out (KLF album)|Chill Out]]'', the [[ambient house]] genre. The KLF released a series of international hits on their own KLF Communications record label and became the biggest selling singles act in the world in 1991.<ref name=":1" /><!-- worked on a road movie called ''[[The White Room (film)|The White Room]]''.-->

From the outset, the KLF adopted the philosophy espoused by esoteric novels ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'', making [[anarchism|anarchic]] [[situationist International|situationist]] manifestations, including the [[vandalism|defacement]] of [[billboard|billboard adverts]], the posting of cryptic advertisements in ''[[NME]]'' and the mainstream press, as well as unusual performances on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. In collaboration with the [[Extreme Noise Terror]] at the [[Brit Awards|BRIT Awards]] in February 1992, they fired [[machine gun]] [[blank (cartridge)|blanks]] into the audience and dumped a dead sheep at the aftershow party. This performance pre-announced The KLF's departure from the music business and, in May of that year, they [[deletion (music industry)|deleted]] their entire [[Music catalog|back-catalogue]]. Drummond and Cauty established the [[K Foundation]] and sought to subvert the [[art world]], staging an [[K Foundation art award|alternative art award]] for the Worst Artist of The Year, and [[K Foundation Burn a Million Quid|burning one million pounds sterling]].

Although the duo remained true to their word of May 1992, with the KLF Communications catalogue remaining deleted, they have released a small number of new tracks since then, as the K Foundation, [[The One World Orchestra]], and in 1997, as [[Fuck the Millennium|2K]]. Drummond and Cauty reappeared in 2017 as The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, releasing a novel ''[[2023: A Trilogy|2023]],'' and rebooting an earlier campaign to build a "People's Pyramid". On 1 January 2021, after years of silence, the band began uploading their long-deleted catalogue to [[Streaming service provider|streaming services]], in a five-part series of [[Compilation album|compilations]] ''Samplecity thru Trancentral'', including ''[[Solid State Logik]]'', ''[[Come Down Dawn]]'', and further releases to come.<ref name="BBC 2021-01-01">{{cite news|last=Savage|first=Mark|date=1 January 2021|title=The KLF's songs are finally available to stream|work=[[BBC News Online]]|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-55507226|access-date=1 January 2021}}</ref>

In July 1986, Drummond resigned from his position as an [[A&R]] man at record label [[Warner Music Group|WEA]], citing that he was nearly 33⅓ years old (33⅓ [[revolutions per minute]] being the speed at which a [[gramophone record|vinyl LP]] revolves), and that it was "time for a revolution in my life.

{{quote|It was New Year's Day ... 1987. I was at home with my parents, I was going for a walk in the morning, it was, like, bright blue sky, and I thought "I'm going to make a hip-hop record. Who can I make a hip-hop record with?". I wasn't brave enough to go and do it myself, 'cause, although I can play the guitar, and I can knock out a few things on the piano, I knew nothing, personally, about the technology. And, I thought, I knew [Jimmy], I knew he was a like spirit, we share similar tastes and backgrounds in music and things. So I phoned him up that day and said "Let's form a band called The Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu". And he knew exactly, to coin a phrase, "where I was coming from"....

===The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu===
Early in 1987, Drummond and Cauty's collaborations began. They assumed alter egos&nbsp;– King Boy D and Rockman Rock respectively&nbsp;– and adopted the name The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (The JAMs), after the fictional conspiratorial group "The Justified Ancients of Mummu" from ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]''.<ref name="Info1"/><ref>{{LibraryOfMu|mu-id=479|first=Ian|last=Cranna|title=1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?) review|work=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|date=1987|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004150537/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=479|archive-date=4 October 2016}}</ref>  The JAMs' primary instrument was the [[sampler (musical instrument)|digital sampler]] with which they would [[plagiarism|plagiarise]] the history of popular music, cutting chunks from existing works and pasting them into new contexts, underpinned by rudimentary [[beatboxing|beatbox]] rhythms and overlaid with Drummond's [[rapping|raps]], of social commentary, esoteric metaphors and mockery.<ref name="Trouserpress"/><ref name="AMG"/>

The JAMs' debut single "[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs song)|All You Need Is Love]]" dealt with the media coverage given to [[AIDS]], sampling heavily from [[the Beatles]]' "[[All You Need Is Love]]" and [[Samantha Fox]]'s "[[Touch Me (I Want Your Body)]]". Although it was declined by distributors fearful of prosecution, and threatened with lawsuits, copies of the one-sided [[white label]] 12" were sent to the [[music journalism|music press]]; it received positive reviews and was made "single of the week" in ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]''.<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=All You Need Is Love|type=review|magazine=[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]|date=14 March 1987<!--library of mu ID 20-->}}</ref> A later piece in the same magazine called The JAMs "the hottest, most exhilarating band this year&nbsp;....

The JAMs re-edited and re-released "All You Need Is Love" in May 1987, removing or doctoring the most antagonistic samples; lyrics from the song appeared as promotional [[graffiti]], defacing selected billboards. The re-release rewarded the JAMs with praise (including ''NME''{{hsp}}'s "single of the week")<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Kelly|first=Danny |author-link=Danny Kelly (journalist)|title=All You Need Is Love|type=review|magazine=[[NME]]|date=23 May 1987<!--library of mu ID 33-->}}</ref> and the funds necessary to record their debut album. The album, ''[[1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)|1987 (What the F**k Is Going On?)]]'', was released in June 1987. Included was a song called "The Queen and I", which sampled the [[ABBA]] single "[[Dancing Queen]]".<ref name="biog">{{LibraryOfMu|tl=web|mu-id=512|title=The KLF Biography as of 20th July 1990 (KLF BIOG 012)|publisher=[[KLF Communications]]|date=December 1990|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916113659/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=512|archive-date=16 September 2016}}</ref> After a legal showdown with ABBA<ref>{{Cite news|last=Didcock|first=Barry|title=Bitter Swede symphony|work=[[Sunday Herald]]|location=[[Glasgow]]|date=21 October 2001|page=4}}</ref> and the [[Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society]],<ref>News item, ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', 12 September 1987</ref> the ''1987'' album was forcibly withdrawn from sale. Drummond and Cauty travelled to Sweden in hope of meeting ABBA and coming to some agreement, taking an ''NME'' journalist and photographer with them, along with most of the remaining copies of the LP.<ref name=sweden87>{{Cite magazine|last=Brown|first=James|author-link=James Brown (editor)|title=Thank you for the music|magazine=[[NME]]|date=17 October 1987<!--library of mu ID 44-->}}</ref> They failed to meet ABBA, so disposed of the copies by burning most of them in a field and throwing the rest overboard on the [[North Sea]] ferry trip home. In a December 1987 interview, Cauty maintained that they "felt that what [they]'d done was artistically justified."<ref name = "tune"/>

Two new singles followed on the JAMs' "KLF Communications" independent record label.<ref name="discog"/> Both reflected a shift towards [[house music|house]] rhythms. According to ''NME'', The JAMs' choice of samples for the first of these, "[[Whitney Joins The JAMs]]" saw them leaving behind their strategy of "collision course" to "move straight onto the art of super selective theft".<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Whitney Joins The JAMs|type=review|magazine=[[NME]]|date=22 August 1987}}</ref> The song uses samples of the ''[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]'' and ''[[Shaft (1971 film)|Shaft]]'' themes alongside [[Whitney Houston]]'s "[[I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)|I Wanna Dance With Somebody]]". Drummond has claimed that the KLF were later offered the job of producing or remixing a new Whitney Houston album as an inducement from her record label boss ([[Clive Davis]] of [[Arista Records]]) to sign with them.<ref name="X">{{LibraryOfMu|mu-id=229|last=Longmire|first=Ernie ("Lazlo Nibble")|title=KLF is Gonna Rock Ya!|work=X Magazine|date=1 April 1991|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916121146/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=229|archive-date=16 September 2016|type=Interview with Bill Drummond}}</ref><ref name="Bomlagadafshipoing">{{LibraryOfMu|tl=interview|mu-id=521|title=Bomlagadafshipoing|last=Drummond|first=Bill|subject-link=Bill Drummond|publisher=[[NRK P2|Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation Radio 2]]<!--(Norwegian national radio house-music show: see https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diskusjon:The_KLF)-->|date=September 1991|mu-transcript-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916112917/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=521|archive-date=16 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{LibraryOfMu|mu-id=261|title=Public NME|type=News item about the KLF turning down Whitney Houston|work=[[NME]]|date=16 November 1991|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916124846/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=261|archive-date=September 16, 2016 }}</ref> The second single in this sequence&nbsp;– Drummond and Cauty's third and final single of 1987&nbsp;– was "[[Down Town]]", a dance record built around a [[gospel choir]] and "[[Downtown (Petula Clark song)|Downtown]]" by 1960s star [[Petula Clark]].<ref>Reviewed by ''[[NME]]'' writer [[James Brown (editor)|James Brown]] in the 28 November 1987 edition.</ref> These early works were later collected on the compilation album ''[[Shag Times]]''.

A second album, ''[[Who Killed The JAMs?]]'', was released in early 1988.

===The Timelords===<!-- there are section links to this header -->

In 1988, Drummond and Cauty released a '[[novelty song|novelty]]' pop single, "[[Doctorin' the Tardis]]" as The Timelords.<ref name="sounds-timelords"/> The song is predominantly a [[mashup (music)|mash-up]] of the [[Doctor Who theme music|''Doctor Who'' theme music]], "[[Block Buster!]]" by [[The Sweet|Sweet]] and [[Gary Glitter]]'s "[[Rock and Roll (Gary Glitter song)|Rock and Roll (Part Two)]]".<ref name="trash"/>

The Timelords released one other product, a 1989 book called ''[[The Manual|The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)]]'', a step-by-step guide to achieving a number one hit single with little money or talent.<ref name="the-manual"/>

===The KLF===
By the time the JAMs' single "Whitney Joins The JAMs" was released in September 1987, their record label had been renamed "KLF Communications" (from the earlier "The Sound of Mu(sic)").<ref name="discog"/> The duo's first release as the KLF was in March 1988, with the single "[[Burn the Bastards|Burn the Bastards"/"Burn the Beat]]" (KLF 002).<ref name="discog"/> Although the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu name was not retired, most future Drummond and Cauty releases went under the name "The KLF".

The name change accompanied a change in Drummond and Cauty's musical direction. As 'King Boy D', Drummond said in January 1988, "We might put out a couple of 12" records under the name The K.L.F., these will be rap free just pure dance music, so don't expect to see them reviewed in the music papers". King Boy D also said that he and Rockman Rock were "pissed off at [them]selves" for letting "people expect us to lead some sort of crusade for sampling".<ref name="info88">{{LibraryOfMu|tl=web|mu-id=501|first=Bill|last=Drummond|author-link=Bill Drummond|publisher=[[KLF Communications]]|date=22 January 1988|title=KLF Info Sheet|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916115810/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=501|archive-date=16 September 2016}}</ref> In 1990 he recalled that "We wanted to make [as the KLF] something that was ... pure dance music, without any reference points, without any nod to the history of rock and roll. It was the type of music that by early '87 was really exciting ''me''&nbsp;... [although] we weren't able to get our first KLF records out until late '88".<ref name="skinner"/>

The 12" records subsequently released in 1988 and 1989 by the KLF were indeed rap free and house-oriented; remixes of some of the JAMs tracks, and new singles, the largely instrumental [[acid house]] anthems "[[What Time Is Love?]]" and "[[3 a.m. Eternal]]", the first incarnations of later international chart successes. The KLF described <!--the sound of -->these new tracks as "Pure Trance". In 1989, the KLF appeared at the [[Helter Skelter (rave music promoter)|Helter Skelter rave]] in [[Oxfordshire]].

Also in 1989, the KLF embarked upon the creation of a [[road movie]] and [[soundtrack album]], both titled ''[[The KLF films|The White Room]]'', funded by the profits of "Doctorin' The Tardis".<ref>{{LibraryOfMu|mu-id=94|last=Mellor|first=Christopher|title=Beam Me Up, Scotty – How to have a number one (The JAMs way)|work=Offbeat|date=February 1989|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824233847/http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=94 |archive-date=24 August 2007 }}</ref> Neither the film nor its soundtrack were formally released, although [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] copies exist. The soundtrack album contained pop-house versions of some of the "pure trance" singles, as well as new songs, most of which would appear (in radically reworked form) on the version of the album which was eventually released to mainstream success. A single from the original album was released: "[[Kylie Said to Jason]]", an [[electropop]] record featuring references to [[Todd Terry]], [[Rolf Harris]], [[Skippy the Bush Kangaroo]] and BBC comedy programme ''[[The Good Life (1975 TV series)|The Good Life]]''. In reference to that song, Drummond and Cauty noted that they had worn "[[Pet Shop Boys]] infatuations brazenly on [their] sleeves".<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|type=Sleeve notes|title=Indie Top 20 Volume 8|publisher=[[Beechwood Music]]|id=TT08|year=1990|others=[[Various Artists]]}}</ref>

The film project was fraught with difficulties and setbacks, including dwindling funds. "Kylie Said to Jason", which Drummond and Cauty were hoping could "rescue them from the jaws of bankruptcy", flopped commercially, failing even to make the UK top 100. In consequence, ''The White Room'' film project was put on hold, and the KLF abandoned the musical direction of the soundtrack and single.<ref name="info8">{{LibraryOfMu|tl=web|mu-id=508|publisher=[[KLF Communications]]|title=The White Room - Information Sheet Eight|date=August 1990|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005024345/http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=508|archive-date=5 October 2007}}</ref>
Meanwhile, "What Time Is Love?" was generating acclaim within the underground clubs of continental Europe; according to KLF Communications, "The KLF were being feted by all the 'right' DJs".<ref name="info8" /> This prompted Drummond and Cauty to pursue the acid house tone of their Pure Trance series. A further Pure Trance release, "[[Last Train to Trancentral]]", followed.

===BRIT Awards and retirement from the music business===

In the weeks following the BRITs performance, the KLF continued working with Extreme Noise Terror on the album ''[[The Black Room (KLF album)|The Black Room]]'', but it was never finished.<ref name="select92"/> On 14 May 1992, the KLF announced their immediate retirement from the music industry and the [[deletion (music industry)|deletion]] of their back catalogue:

The last two of which has [sic] led us up onto the commercial high ground – we are at a point where the path is about to take a sharp turn from these sunny uplands down into a netherworld of we know not what. For the foreseeable future there will be no further record releases from The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, The Timelords, The KLF and any other past, present and future name attached to our activities.

If we meet further along be prepared&nbsp;... our disguise may be complete.<ref name="TimelordsGentlemen"/><ref name="RetirementAd">KLF Communications advertisement in ''[[NME]]'', 16 May 1992.</ref>}}

In a comprehensive examination of the KLF's announcement and its context, ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'' called it "the last grand gesture, the most heroic act of public self destruction in the history of pop. And it's also Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty's final extravagant howl of self disgust, defiance and contempt for a music world gone foul and corrupt."<ref name="select92"/> Many of the KLF's friends and collaborators gave their reactions in the magazine. Movie director Bill Butt said that "Like everything, they're dealing with it in a very realistic way, a fresh, unbitter way, which is very often not the case. A lot of bands disappear with such a terrible loss of dignity". Scott Piering said that "They've got a huge buzz off this, that's for sure, because it's something that's finally thrilling. It's scary to have thrown away a fortune which I ''know'' they have. Just the idea of starting over is exciting. Starting over on what? Well, they have such great ideas, like buying submarines". Even Kenny Gates, who as a director of the KLF's distributors APT stood to lose financially from the move, called it "Conceptually and philosophically&nbsp;... absolutely brilliant". [[Mark Stent]] reported the doubts of many when he said that "I [have] had so many people who I know, heads of record companies, A&R men saying, 'Come on, It's a big scam.' But I firmly believe it's over". "For the very last spectacularly insane time", the magazine concluded, "The KLF have done what was least expected of them".

The final KLF Info sheet discussed the retirement in a typically offbeat fashion, and asked "What happens to 'Footnotes in rock legend'? Do they gather dust with [[Ashton Gardner and Dyke]], the [[The Vapors|Vapors]], and the [[Utah Saints]], or does their influence live on in unseen ways, permeating future cultures? A passing general of a private army has the answer. 'No', he whispers 'but the dust they gather is of the rarest quality.

=== ''Samplecity thru Trancentral'' ===
On 31 December 2020, the release of series of remastered compilations under the collective title ''Samplecity thru Trancentral'' was announced on a [[graffiti]] and posters hung under a railway bridge on [[Kingsland Road]] in [[Shoreditch]], [[East End of London|East London]]. The 30-minute collection of eight remastered singles ''[[Solid State Logik|Solid State Logik 1]]'' appeared at midnight 1 January 2021, on [[Streaming service provider|streaming platforms]], while [[high-definition video]]s were published for the first time on the band's official [[YouTube]] channel, marking the first activity of Cauty and Drummond as the KLF since 1992.<ref name=":0">{{cite news|last=Beaumont-Thomas|first=Ben|date=1 January 2021|title=The KLF reissue music for first time since 1992|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jan/01/the-klf-reissue-music-for-first-time-since-1992|access-date=2 January 2021}}</ref> On 23 March 2021, the collection was followed by its part ''2'' featuring 12" versions of the singles.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Krol|first=Charlotte|date=2021-03-23|title=The KLF add compilation including unreleased Jarvis Cocker collab to streaming|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-klf-add-singles-compilation-including-unreleased-jarvis-cocker-collaboration-to-streaming-services-2906340|access-date=2021-03-23|website=NME|language=en-GB}}</ref>

On 4 February 2021, a re-edited version of ''[[Chill Out (KLF album)|Chill Out]]'' was released, retitled ''[[Come Down Dawn]]'', with previously [[Copyright infringement|unlicensed samples]] from the original release removed,<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-02-04|title=The KLF release new reworked album 'Come Down Dawn'|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-klf-release-new-reworked-album-come-down-dawn-2872777|access-date=2021-02-04|website=NME {{!}} Music, Film, TV, Gaming & Pop Culture News|language=en-GB}}</ref> and added "What Time Is Love?

==KLF Communications==
[[File:Pyramid Blaster.png|thumb|right|The Pyramid Blaster&nbsp;– the logo of KLF Communications]]
From their very earliest releases as The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu until their [[The KLF#Retirement|retirement]] in 1992, the music of Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty was [[independent record label|independently released]] in their home country (the UK).<ref name="discogs">KLF Communications profile at [[Discogs.com]] ([http://www.discogs.com/label/KLF+Communications link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615115823/http://www.discogs.com/label/KLF%2BCommunications |date=15 June 2013 }})</ref> Their debut releases – the single "[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs song)|All You Need Is Love]]" and the album ''[[1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)|1987]]'' – were released under the label name "The Sound Of Mu(sic)". By the end of 1987 Drummond and Cauty had renamed their label to "KLF Communications" and, in October 1987, the first of many "information sheets" (self written missives from the KLF to fans and the media) was sent out by the label.<ref name="Info1"/>

KLF Communications releases were [[record distributor|distributed]] by [[Rough Trade Distribution]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/22/indie-record-labels-changed-world|title=How indie labels changed the world|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=22 March 2012|first=Richard|last=King}}</ref> (a spinoff of [[Rough Trade Records]]) in the South East of England, and across the wider UK by [[The Cartel (record distributor)|the Cartel]].

Outside the UK, KLF releases were issued under licence by local labels. In the US, the licensees were [[Wax Trax]] (the ''[[Chill Out (KLF album)|Chill Out]]'' album<ref name="allmusic-chillout">{{AllMusic|id=mw0000092678|first=John|last=Bush|title=Chill Out|access-date=5 March 2020}}</ref>), [[TVT Records|TVT]] (early releases including ''[[The History of The JAMs a.k.a.

The KLF Communications catalogue remains deleted in the United Kingdom.

==Themes==
Several threads and themes unify the many incarnations of Drummond and Cauty's creative partnership, many of these influenced by ''The Illuminatus! Trilogy''<!--this statement will be supported by references in the Illuminatus section--><!-- Mostly these are esoteric or opaque in nature, which has led ''Melody Maker'' to compare them to [[The Residents]].<ref name="Stubbs"/>{{refn|group=n|In his book ''[[45 (book)|45]]'', Drummond documented his love of The Residents as a concept.<ref name="45book"/>}}-->; combined, these themes, threads and their activities over the years have been said to form a "mythology".<ref name="sheep-seats"/><ref name="steven-poole"/><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://recordcollectormag.com/reviews/turn-strobe-klf-jams-timelords-history|title=Turn Up The Strobe: The KLF, The Jams, The Timelords – A History|type=review|first=Terry|last=Staunton|access-date=2 March 2020}}</ref><!--there's also https://www.classicpopmag.com/2015/03/lowdown-kopyright-liberation-front/ but that seems to me to be a summary of the Wikipedia articles, with the word "mythology" thrown in--> Drummond and Cauty made heavy references to<!--"practiced"?

The piece I currently have cited from the Quietus is probably based on Higgs' writing as it mentions the book and calls it "one of the most important texts of the last few years"-->

In a 2000 review of Drummond's book ''45'', and an appraisal of the duo's career to date, writer [[Steven Poole]] stated that Drummond and Cauty "are the only true [[conceptual art]]ists of the [1990s]. And for all the [[wikt:eldritch|eldritch]] beauty of their art, their most successful creation is the myth they have built around themselves."<ref name="steven-poole">{{LibraryOfMu|tl=news|mu-id=487|author-link=Steven Poole|last=Poole|first=Steven|title=Hit man, myth maker - 45|work=[[The Observer]]|date=26 February 2000 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916112918/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=487 |archive-date=16 September 2016 }}</ref> This deep and perplexing<!--he used the word "arcane", amongst other clever writing--> mythology, he suggested, results in all their subsequent activities (as a partnership or otherwise) being absorbed into their mystique:

{{quote|A myth like the KLF's is peculiarly omnivorous. Just as there can never be any evidence to disprove a conspiracy theory because the fabrication of such evidence&nbsp;– don't you see?&nbsp;– is itself part of the conspiracy, so the pop myth of the KLF can never be blown apart by anything they do, no matter how dumb or embarrassing. The myth will suck it up, like a black hole.}}

Drummond and Cauty have also been compared to [[Stewart Home]] and the [[Neoism|Neoists]].<ref>Extract from a feature on [[Stewart Home]]. Cornwell, J. ''[[i-D]]'' Magazine, Nov 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=354 link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916121143/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=354 |date=16 September 2016 }})</ref> Home himself said that the duo's work "has much more in common with the Neoist, Plagiarist and Art Strike movements of the nineteen-eighties than with the [[Situationist International|Situationist]] avant-garde of the fifties and sixties." Drummond and Cauty "represent a vital and innovative strand within contemporary culture", he added.<ref>[[Stewart Home|Home, Stewart]], "Doctorin' Our Culture", published on the website of The Stewart Home Society ([http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/klf.htm link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314035101/http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/klf.htm |date=14 March 2016 }})</ref>

===''Illuminatus!''===
Drummond was the set designer on [[Ken Campbell]]'s 1976 stage production of ''The Illuminatus! Trilogy''.<ref name="bij-where-now"/><ref name="Contradictions">{{Cite magazine|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/21674-the-klf-justified-ancients-of-mu-mu-bill-drummond-jimmy-cauty|title=Embrace The Contradictions: The Strange World Of...

In the first KLF Communications Info Sheet, Drummond explained that The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu name was  "pinched" from ''Illuminatus!'' which he had been reading the year before.<ref name="Info1">{{LibraryOfMu|tl=web|mu-id=500|last=Drummond|first=Bill|author-link=Bill Drummond|date=October 1987|title=KLF Info Sheet Oct 1987|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311225447/http://www.libraryofmu.org/display-resource.php?id=500 |archive-date=11 March 2007 }}</ref>

The number [[23 enigma|23]] is a theme of ''Illuminatus!'', where instances of the number are both overtly and surreptitiously placed.
<!--NOTE TO EDITORS: the following list is a *representative* selection to illustrate the types of occurrence of 23-->
* In lyrics to the song "Next" from the album ''1987'': "23 years is a mighty long time".
* They announced they had signed a contract preventing either of them from publicly discussing the burning of a million pounds for a period of 23 years;<ref>{{LibraryOfMu|tl=news|mu-id=519 |title=Cape Wrath |author=[[K Foundation]] |date=8 December 1995 |work=[[The Guardian]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916113827/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=519 |archive-date=16 September 2016|type=advertisement}}</ref>
* Their 1997 return as 2K was "for 23 minutes only".<ref name="2K">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mutelibtech.com/mute/2k/2k1.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060327005822/http://www.mutelibtech.com/mute/2k/2k1.htm |archive-date=27 March 2006 |website=mutelibtech.com |title=They're Back |publisher=[[Mute Records]] }}</ref>
* In numbering schemes: for instance, the debut single "All You Need Is Love" took the catalogue number JAMS 23, while the final KLF Communications Information Sheet was numbered 23; and Cauty's Ford Galaxie police car had on its roof the identification mark 23.
* In significant dates during their work: for instance, a rare public appearance by the KLF, at the Liverpool Festival of Comedy, was on 23 June 1991; they announced the winner of the K Foundation award on 23 November 1993;<ref>{{LibraryOfMu|mu-id=368|title=K-Foundation nailed|work=[[NME]]|date=11 December 1993|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916115513/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=368 |archive-date=16 September 2016}}</ref> and they burned one million pounds on 23 August 1994.<ref name="burning"/>
* The 2017 reunion happened at 00:23 on 23 August 23 years after the burning, with the release of a book entitled ''2023: A Trilogy''. The numerals of the date – 23 August 2017 – also sum to 23 (2+3+0+8+2+0+1+7=23).<ref name=gua2017/>

When questioned on the importance that he attaches to this number, Drummond has been evasive, responding enigmatically "I know. But I'm not going to tell, because then other people would have to stop having to wonder and the thing about beauty is for other people to wonder at it. It's not very beautiful once you know."<ref name="i-D">{{LibraryOfMu|mu-id=392|title=Freak Show|work=[[i-D]]|date=December 1994|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916111453/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=392 |archive-date=16 September 2016}}</ref>

The "Pyramid Blaster" is a logo and [[iconography|icon]] frequently and prominently depicted within the duo's collective work: a [[pyramid]], in front of which is suspended a [[boombox|ghetto blaster]] displaying the word "Justified".<ref name="info8"/><ref name="Contradictions"/> This references the [[Eye of Providence]] icon, often depicted as an eye within a triangle or pyramid, a significant symbol of ''Illuminatus!''<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1064/is-the-dollar-bills-eye-on-a-pyramid-the-symbol-of-a-secret-society/|title=Is the dollar bill's eye-on-a-pyramid the symbol of a secret society?|first=Cecil|last=Adams|author-link=Cecil Adams|work=[[The Straight Dope]]|date=23 May 1997|access-date=9 March 2020}}</ref> The pyramid was also a theme of the duo's 1997 and 2017 reunions, with the proposed building by [[Fuck the Millennium#K2 Plant Hire|K2 Plant Hire]] of a "People's Pyramid" (in 1997, a pyramid built with as many bricks as there were births in the 20th century in the UK,<ref name="brickin"/> and in 2017 a pyramid built from bricks containing the ashes of dead people).<ref name="cauty-pyramid"/>

('I hate the place. I've no alternative but to live here.') There's little evidence of fame or fortune. The kitchen is heated by means of leaving the three functioning gas rings on at full blast until the fumes make us all feel stoned&nbsp;....

===Ceremonies and journeys===
Drummond and Cauty's work often involved notions of ceremony and journey. Journeys are the subject of the KLF Communications recordings ''Chill Out'', ''Space'', "Last Train to Trancentral", "Justified & Ancient" and "America: What Time Is Love?", as well as the aborted film project ''The White Room''. The ''Chill Out'' album depicts a journey across the [[U.S. Gulf Coast]].<ref name="allmusic-chillout"/> In his book ''45'', Drummond expressed his admiration for the work of artist [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]], who incorporates physical journeys into his art.<ref name="45book">{{cite book|title=[[45 (book)|45]]|publisher=[[Little, Brown Book Group|Little, Brown]]|first=Bill|last=Drummond|author-link=Bill Drummond|date=2000|isbn=0316853852}}<!--page number needed, or improvements from Higgs book, or we lose the sentence, or we lose the journeys thing altogether. TBD.--></ref>

Fire and [[sacrifice]] were recurring ceremonial themes: Drummond and Cauty made fires to dispose of their illegal debut album and to sacrifice the KLF's profits; their dead sheep gesture of 1992 carried a sacrificial message. The KLF's short film ''[[The KLF films|The Rites of Mu]]'' depicts their celebration of the 1991 [[Midsummer|summer solstice]] on the [[Hebrides|Hebridean]] island of [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]]: a {{convert|60|ft|m|adj=on}} tall [[wicker man]] was burnt at a ceremony in which journalists were asked to wear yellow and grey robes and join a [[chant]];<ref name="i-D" /><ref>{{Cite news|title=On location: The isle of Jura|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/aug/12/filminspiredtravel.scotland|first=Caroline|last=Roux|date=12 August 2006|access-date=25 February 2020|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> the journalists' money was also burnt.<ref name="Reid"/><ref>{{Cite AV media|type=VHS|title=The Rites Of Mu|publisher=[[KLF Communications]]|year=1991|id= KLF VT014|author=The KLF}}</ref><!--not sure about mixing fire and sacrifice.

From the outset of their collaborations, Drummond and Cauty practised the [[guerrilla communication]] tactic that they described as "illegal but effective use of [[graffiti]] on [[billboard (advertising)|billboards]] and public buildings" in which "the original meaning of the advert would be totally subverted".<ref name="biog" /> Much as the JAMs' early recordings carried messages on the back of existing musical works, their promotional graffiti often derived its potency from the context in which it was placed. For instance, The JAMs' "SHAG SHAG SHAG" graffiti, coinciding with their release of "[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs song)|All You Need Is Love]]", was drawn over the "HALO HALO HALO" slogan of a ''[[Today (UK newspaper)|Today]]'' billboard that depicted [[Greater Manchester]] Police Chief Constable [[James Anderton]],<ref name="Sounds16May"/> who had decried [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] amidst the UK media's AIDS furore.{{refn|group=n|For a general overview see: "The 1980s AIDS campaign" by ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' on the [[BBC News]] website.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/4348096.stm|title=The 1980s AIDS campaign|date=16 October 2005|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=27 February 2020}}</ref> A fuller set of references are available in the article "[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs song)]]".}}

Music press journalists were occasionally invited to witness the defacements. In December 1987, a ''Melody Maker'' reporter was in attendance to see Cauty reverse his car Ford Timelord alongside a billboard and stand on its roof to graffiti a [[Christmas]] message from the JAMs.<ref name="tune">{{LibraryOfMu|mu-id=52|first=Mat|last=Smith|title=The Great TUNE Robbery|work=[[Melody Maker]]|date=12 December 1987|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004211026/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=52|archive-date=4 October 2016}}</ref> In February 1991, another ''Melody Maker'' journalist watched the KLF deface a billboard advertising ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', doctoring the slogan "[[Gulf War|THE GULF]]: the coverage, the analysis, the facts" by painting a 'K' over the 'GU'. Drummond and Cauty were, on this occasion, caught at the scene by police and arrested, later to be released without charge.<ref name="Stubbs" />

In November 1991, the JAMs placed a photograph of graffiti with the slogan "It's Grim Up North" – which had appeared on the junction of London's [[M25 motorway|M25]] orbital motorway with the [[M1 motorway|M1]] that runs to Northern England<ref name="nme-political">{{LibraryOfMu|mu-id=258|title=The JAMs: centre of political interest|work=[[NME]]|date=9 November 1991|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916114545/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=258|archive-date=16 September 2016}}</ref> – as an advert in the ''NME''.<ref>{{Cite magazine|title="It's Grim Up North" Graffiti Advert|type=advertisement|date=2 November 1991|magazine=[[NME]]}}</ref> The graffiti, for which the JAMs denied responsibility,<ref name="nme-political"/><ref>{{LibraryOfMu|mu-id=257|title=It's Grim Up North|type=Single of the Week|work=[[NME]]|date=2 November 1991|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916125203/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=257|archive-date=16 September 2016}}</ref> had been the subject of an [[early day motion]] in the [[British House of Commons]] on 21 October 1991.<ref name="nme-political"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edm.parliament.uk/early-day-motion/2130|title=MOTORWAY GRAFFITI - Early Day Motions|publisher=[[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]|date=21 October 1991|access-date=29 February 2020|quote=That this House calls on the Secretary of State for Transport to remove the huge white painted graffiti on the bridge over the M1 on the northbound carriageway just north of the M25 junction which reads – Its Grim Up North, or alternatively arrange to add the words, Gruesome in the Midlands, and Nowt but Homeless Folk in Cardboard Boxes in London, to restore a fair regional balance during the next election.|type=Early Day Motion by [[Joseph Ashton (politician)|Joe Ashton]] MP}}</ref> In September 1997, on the day after Drummond and Cauty's brief remergence as 2K, the graffiti "1997: What The Fuck's Going On?" appeared on the outside wall of London's [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], ten years after the slogan "1987: What The Fuck's Going On?" had been similarly placed to mark the release of the JAMs' debut album.<ref>{{LibraryOfMu|mu-id=465|title=Pre-millennium tension hits new high|work=[[NME]]|date=27 September 1997|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916120234/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=465 |archive-date=16 September 2016 }}</ref>

===Reputation as "pranksters"===
Cauty and Drummond's tactics have often been labelled by media commentators as "[[Situationist prank|pranks]]" or "[[publicity stunt]]s".<ref name="psb"/><ref name="Flint"/><ref name="Stubbs"/><ref name="bbc-saboteurs"/>

In 1991 Drummond told an ''NME'' journalist that "we never felt we went out and did things to get reactions. Everything we've done has just been on a gut level instinct",  whilst acknowledging that people would likely not believe him.<ref name="coronation">{{LibraryOfMu|mu-id=191|last=Morton|first=Roger|title=One Coronation Under A Groove|work=[[NME]]|date=12 January 1991|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004150446/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=191 |archive-date=4 October 2016}}</ref> On the morning after the BRITs performance, an impassioned Drummond told the ''NME'' that "I really hate it when people go on about us being 'schemers' and 'scammers'. We do all this stuff from the very depths of our soul and people make out its some sort of game. It depresses me."<ref name="sheep-seats"/>

Cauty has expressed similar feelings, saying of the KLF, "I think it worked because we really meant it."<ref name="Butler" />

''[[Sound on Sound]]'' magazine credited the KLF with "set[ting] the trend for a new approach to mixing". Engineer [[Mark Stent]] is quoted as saying:

{{quote|It was in working with Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty that things really started to happen in a new way, using mixing as a work-in-progress, rather than an end stage. We were running everything live in the studio, from [[music sequencer|sequencers]] and samplers. Obviously there was also stuff on tape, but they would come in with their [[Atari ST|Ataris]] and [[Akai]] samplers, and we would end up rearranging the whole song whilst mixing things. They would then take away what we did, work on it again, and come back a while later, and I'd mix stuff again. My KLF work put me in the picture, and after that the phone never stopped ringing.<ref name="SoS"/>}}-->

===Opinions of contemporaries===
In 1991, [[Chris Lowe]] of Pet Shop Boys said that he considered the only other worthwhile group in the UK to be the KLF. [[Neil Tennant]] added that "They have an incredibly recognisable sound. I liked it when they said [[EMF (band)|EMF]] nicked the F from KLF.<ref name="coronation"/> They're from a different tradition to us in that they're pranksters and we've never been pranksters."<ref name="psb"/>

At the time of the KLF's retirement announcement, Drummond's old friend and colleague [[David Balfe]] said of Drummond's KLF career that "the path he's trod[den] is a more artistic one than mine. I know that deep down I like the idea of building up a very successful career, where Bill is more interested in weird stuff&nbsp;... I think the very avoidance of cliché has become their particular cliché".<ref name="select92"/>

In March 1994, members of the anarchist band [[Chumbawamba]] expressed their respect for the KLF. Vocalist and percussionist Alice Nutter referred to the KLF as "real situationists" categorising them as political musicians alongside the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]. Dunst Bruce lauded the K Foundation, concluding "I think the things the KLF do are fantastic. I'm a vegetarian but I wish they'd sawn an elephant's legs off at the BRIT Awards."<ref>{{LibraryOfMu|mu-id=378|author-link=Stuart Maconie|last=Maconie|first=Stuart|title=Chumbawamba interview|work=[[Select (magazine)|Select]]|date=March 1994|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916114318/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=378 |archive-date=16 September 2016}}</ref><!--Note for copyedit/discussion: Do we need this?

===Direct influence===
The KLF have been imitated to some degree by German techno band [[Scooter (band)|Scooter]], being sampled on virtually every album Scooter have released.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.electronicbeats.net/style-icons-h-p-baxxter-on-the-klf/|first=H.P.|last=Baxxter|author-link=H.P.

In the weeks leading up to the [[1996 FA Cup Final]], a group called "1300 Drums featuring the Unjustified Ancients of M.U." released a novelty single to cash-in on the popularity of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] footballer [[Eric Cantona]].<ref name="discog">{{KLFDiscography}}</ref>

The Timelords' book, ''[[The Manual]]'', was used by the one-hit-wonders [[Edelweiss (band)|Edelweiss]] to secure their hit "Bring Me Edelweiss".<ref name="bill-reviews"/><ref name="X" /><ref>{{Cite news|last=Reighley|first=Kurt B.|title=Hear No Evil|work=[[Seattle Weekly]]|date=26 May 1999|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/music/9921/two-reighley.php|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016192929/http://seattleweekly.com/1999-05-26/music/hear-no-evil.php|archive-date=16 October 2007}}</ref>

The duo "The FLK" released two albums and several singles in the 2010s, appropriating the KLF's aesthetic and musical style and mixing it with samples and references from [[folk music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.echoesanddust.com/2015/12/the-flk-mummers/|title=The FLK: Mummers|author=Si Forster|website=Echoes and Dust|date=1 September 2015|access-date=10 July 2020}}</ref> Their anonymity, along with details such as their use of a Ford Timelord which was very similar to the original in their videos and promotional material, led some to believe that the FLK actually were the KLF. However, it emerged in 2018 that they were two ex-members of the Leeds-based [[Independent music|indie]] band [[The Hollow Men (band)|The Hollow Men]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Smith |first=Mat |date=Aug 2020 |title=Time Machine |magazine=Electronic Sound |location=Norwich, UK |publisher=Pam Communications Limited |pages=16–17 }}</ref>

===Career retrospectives===
Drummond and Cauty have appeared frequently in British [[broadsheet]]s and music papers since the KLF's retirement, most often in connection with the K Foundation and their burning of one million pounds. The ''NME'' called them "masters of manipulating media and perceptions of themselves".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/klf/9225|title=Fresh JAMMs?|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115183849/http://www.nme.com/news/klf/9225 |archive-date=15 January 2016|work=[[NME]]|date=6 September 2001|first=Adam|last=Bychawski}}</ref>

In 1992, ''NME'' referred to the KLF as "Britain's greatest pop group" and "the two most brilliant minds in pop today",<ref name="sheep-seats"/> and in 2002 listed the duo in their "Top 50 Icons" at number 48.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Top 50 NME Icons|work=[[NME]]|url=http://microsites.nme.com/nme50/41_50.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020529172441/http://microsites.nme.com/nme50/41_50.html|archive-date=29 May 2002}}<!--. See also "Roll over, Beatles - Smiths top the pops: Oldies and goldies in hall of fame", ''[[The Guardian]]'' ([[Manchester]]), 17 April 2002, "Guardian Home Pages" section, p6.--></ref> The British music paper also listed the KLF's 1992 BRIT Awards appearance at number 4 in their "top 100 rock moments of all time".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/kurt-cobain/6010|title=Top 100 Rock Moments of All Time|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181059/http://www.nme.com/news/kurt-cobain/6010 |archive-date=3 March 2016|website=NME.com|publisher=[[NME]]}}</ref> "What's unique about Drummond and Cauty", the paper said in 1993, "is the way that, under all the slogans and the sampling and the smart hits and the dead sheep and the costumes, they appear not only to care, but to have some idea of how to achieve what they want."<ref name="TateTat"/>

"[Of their many aliases,] it is as the KLF that they will go down in pop history," wrote Alix Sharkey in 1994, "for a variety of reasons, the most important being the resolute purity of their self-abnegation, and their visionary understanding of pop." He added: "By early 1992 the KLF was easily the best-selling, probably the most innovative, and undoubtedly the most exhilarating pop phenomenon in Britain. In five years it had gone from pressing up 500 copies of its debut recording to being one of the world's top singles acts." The same piece also quoted Sheryl Garratt, editor of ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'': "the music hasn't dated. I still get an adrenaline rush listening to it." Garratt believes their influence on the British house and rap scene cannot be overestimated. "Their attitude was shaped by the rave scene, but they also love pop music. So many people who make pop actually despise it, and it shows."<ref name="trash">{{LibraryOfMu|tl=news|mu-id=384|last=Sharkey|first=Alix|title=Trash Art & Kreation|work=[[The Guardian|The Guardian Weekend]]|date=21 May 1994|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916110256/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=384|archive-date=16 September 2016}}</ref>
