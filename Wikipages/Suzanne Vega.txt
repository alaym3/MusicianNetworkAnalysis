'''Suzanne Nadine Vega''' (born July 11, 1959) is an American singer-songwriter best known for her [[Folk music|folk]]-inspired music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/suzanne-vega-mn0000754251/biography|title=Suzanne Vega &#124; Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00tzpbs|title=BBC Four - Songwriters' Circle, Richard Thompson, Suzanne Vega, Loudon Wainwright|website=[[BBC]]}}</ref> Vega's music career spans almost 40 years. She came to prominence in the mid-1980s, releasing four singles that entered the Top 40 charts in the UK during the 1980s and 1990s, including "Marlene on the Wall", "[[Left of Center (Suzanne Vega song)|Left of Center]]", "[[Luka (song)|Luka]]" and "[[No Cheap Thrill]]". "[[Tom's Diner]]", which was originally released as an ''[[a cappella]]'' recording on Vega's second album, ''[[Solitude Standing]]'' (1987), was remixed in 1990 as a dance track by English [[electronic music|electronic]] duo [[DNA (duo)|DNA]] with Vega as featured artist, and it became a Top 10 hit in over five countries.

Accessed June 5, 2009.</ref> In 1984, she received a major [[record label|label]] [[recording contract]], making her one of the first ''Fast Folk'' artists to break out on a major label.

Vega's [[Suzanne Vega (album)|self-titled debut album]] was released in 1985 and was well received by critics in the U.S.;<ref name=bio/> it reached [[music recording sales certification|platinum]] status in the United Kingdom. Produced by [[Lenny Kaye]] and [[Steve Addabbo]], the songs feature Vega's acoustic guitar in straightforward arrangements. A [[music video|video]] was released for the album's song "Marlene on the Wall", which went into [[MTV]] and [[VH1]]'s rotations. During this period Vega also wrote lyrics for two songs ("Lightning" and "Freezing") on ''[[Songs from Liquid Days]]'' by composer [[Philip Glass]].<ref name="Holden">{{Cite news |last=Holden |first=Stephen |author-link=Stephen Holden |date=April 20, 1986 |title=Philip Glass Turns to the Song |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/20/arts/philip-glass-turns-to-the-song.html |newspaper=The New York Times |location=New York, NY |access-date=July 12, 2016 }}</ref>

Vega's song "[[Left of Center (Suzanne Vega song)|Left of Center]]" co-written with [[Steve Addabbo]] for the 1986 [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] film ''[[Pretty in Pink]]'' reached No. 32 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1986.<ref>Roberts, David (2006).

Her next effort, ''[[Solitude Standing]]'' (1987), garnered critical and commercial success, selling over one million copies in the U.S.<ref name="riaa.com">{{Cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database|title=RIAA – Gold & Platinum Searchable Database – June 23, 2015|work=Riaa.com |publisher=[[RIAA]]}}</ref>  It includes the international hit single "[[Luka (song)|Luka]]", which is written about, and from the point of view of, an abused child—at the time an uncommon subject for a pop [[chart-topper|hit]].<ref name="Larkin"/> While continuing a focus on Vega's acoustic guitar, the music is more strongly pop-oriented and features fuller arrangements. Following the success of the album, in 1989 Vega became the first female artist to headline the [[Glastonbury Festival]].<ref name="glasto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/articles/6b208267-d9dd-4bf8-b9b4-9f8573c00455|title=A brief history of female headliners at Glastonbury - BBC Music|date=March 23, 2016|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> In addition, the performance was notable for Vega performing her set whilst wearing a [[bulletproof vest]], her band having received death threats from an obsessed fan ahead of the festival.<ref name="glasto" />

The acappella "[[Tom's Diner]]" from ''Solitude Standing'' became a hit in 1990, having been [[remix]]ed by two British dance producers under the name [[DNA (duo)|DNA]].<ref name="Larkin"/> The track was originally a [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]], until Vega allowed DNA to release it through her record company, and it became her biggest hit.

===1990s===
Vega's third album, ''[[Days of Open Hand]]'' (1990), continued in the style of her first two albums.

In 1992, she released the album ''[[99.9F°]]''. It consists of a mixture of [[folk music]], dance beats and [[industrial music]]. This record was awarded Gold status by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in recognition of selling over 500,000 copies in the U.S.<ref name="riaa.com"/> The single "Blood Makes Noise" from this album peaked at number-one on Billboard's [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]]. Vega later married the album's producer [[Mitchell Froom]].

Her fifth album, ''[[Nine Objects of Desire]]'', was released in 1996.<ref name="Larkin"/> The music varies between a frugal, simple style and the industrial production of ''99.9F°''. This album contains "[[Caramel (Suzanne Vega song)|Caramel]]", featured in the movie ''[[The Truth About Cats & Dogs]]'', and later the [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]] for the movie ''[[Closer (2004 film)|Closer]]''. A song not included on that album, "Woman on the Tier", was featured on the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Dead Man Walking (soundtrack)|Dead Man Walking]]''.

In 1997 she took a singing part on the concept album ''[[Heaven & Hell (Joe Jackson album)|Heaven and Hell]]'', a musical interpretation of the [[seven deadly sins]] by her colleague [[Joe Jackson (musician)|Joe Jackson]], with whom she had already collaborated in 1986 on "Left of Center" from the ''[[Pretty in Pink#Soundtrack|Pretty in Pink]]'' soundtrack (with Vega singing and Jackson playing piano).<ref name="Morse">{{Cite news |last=Morse |first=Steve |date=September 5, 1997 |title=Stepping Out: Pop star turned classical composer, Joe Jackson takes on the Seven Deadly Sins |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5870313/santa_cruz_sentinel/ |newspaper=Santa Cruz Sentinel |location=Santa Cruz, CA |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |access-date=July 12, 2016 }} {{Open access}}</ref>

In early October 2006, Vega participated in the Academia Film Olomouc (AFO) in [[Olomouc]], the Czech Republic, the oldest festival of documentary films in Europe, in which she appeared as a main guest.

Suzanne Vega was among hundreds of artists whose material was destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite news |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=June 28, 2019 |date=June 25, 2019}}</ref>

==Songwriting==
At the age of nine she began to write poetry. She was encouraged to do so by her stepfather.<ref name="sodajerker"/> It took her three years to write her first song, "Brother Mine", which was finished at the age of 14.<ref name="americansongwriter">{{cite interview | url=http://americansongwriter.com/2012/10/suzanne-vega/ | title=Suzanne Vega | date=October 1, 2012 | access-date=October 18, 2016 | last=Vega | first=Suzanne | interviewer=Schlansky, Evan | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019074932/http://americansongwriter.com/2012/10/suzanne-vega/ | archive-date=October 19, 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref> It was first published on ''[[Close-Up Vol. 4, Songs of Family]]'', along with her other early song, "The Silver Lady".<ref name="sodajerker">{{cite web | url=http://www.sodajerker.com/episode-49-suzanne-vega/ | title=Episode 49 – Suzanne Vega | publisher=Sodajerker | date=November 27, 2013 | access-date=October 18, 2016 | author=Barber, Simon and O'Connor, Brian}}</ref>

Vega has not learned to read musical notes; she sees the melody as a shape and chords as colors. She focuses on lyrics and melodic ideas; for advanced features – like intros or [[Bridge (music)|bridges]] – she relies on other artists with whom she works.<ref name="sodajerker"/> Most of her albums, except the first one, were made in such cooperation.<ref name="slugmag">{{cite web | url=http://www.slugmag.com/music-features/a-melody-a-chord-a-lyric-a-conversation-with-suzanne-vega/ | title=A Melody – A Chord – A Lyric: A Conversation with Suzanne Vega | publisher=SLUG Magazine | date=March 17, 2015 | access-date=August 2, 2016 | author=O Hillis, Dean}}</ref>

Vega finishes 80% of the songs she starts writing.<ref name="americansongwriter"/>

The most important artistic influences on her work come from [[Lou Reed]], [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Leonard Cohen]]. Some other important artists for her are [[Paul Simon]] and [[Laura Nyro]].<ref name="americansongwriter"/>

== Theater ==
Vega and [[Duncan Sheik]] wrote a play ''Carson McCullers Talks About Love'', about the life of the writer [[Carson McCullers]]. In the play directed by Kay Matschullat, which premiered in 2011, Vega alternates between monologue and songs.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/01/theater/suzanne-vegas-carson-mccullers-talks-about-love.html?_r=2 |title=Suzanne Vega's 'Carson McCullers Talks About Love' |author=Alan Light |date=April 27, 2011 |newspaper=NYTimes.com |access-date=May 26, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2011/05/06/theater/reviews/suzanne-vegas-carson-mccullers-talks-about-love-review.html |title=The Alienated Souls Whisperer |author=Charles Isherwood |date=May 5, 2011 |newspaper=NYTimes.com |access-date=May 27, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theatermania.com/off-broadway/news/05-2011/carson-mccullers-talks-about-love_36840.html |title=Carson McCullers Talks About Love

The album ''[[Lover, Beloved: Songs from an Evening with Carson McCullers]]'', based on this play, was released in 2016.<ref name="wsj-mccullers"/><ref name="nimbit"/> Vega considers it to be a third version, because it's rewritten, and she made the first version in college.<ref name="theguardian">{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/09/suzanne-vega-interview-carson-mccullers-lover-beloved | title=Suzanne Vega: 'It's taken me a while to say, You are what you are, it's fine' | newspaper=The Guardian | access-date=October 18, 2016 | author=Anthony, Andrew}}</ref>

In early 2020, Vega played the role of "Band Leader" in an [[off-Broadway]] musical based on the 1969 movie ''[[Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice]]'', directed by Scott Elliott and produced at [[The New Group]] in [[New York City]].  She replaced Sheik, who wrote the show's music and co-wrote the lyrics with [[Amanda Green]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2020/01/suzanne-vega-off-broadway-bob-carol-ted-alice-duncan-sheik-1202825026/ |title=Suzanne Vega Adds Name To Off Broadway's 'Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice' Cast |author=Greg Evans |date=January 8, 2020 |newspaper=Deadline.com |access-date=June 28, 2020}}</ref>  In his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', critic [[Ben Brantley]] called the "brandy-voiced" Vega "a delightful, smoothly sardonic presence.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/theater/bob-carol-ted-alice-review.html |title='Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice' Review: Four on a Mattress, With Songs |author=Ben Brantley |date=February 4, 2020 |work=NYTimes.com |access-date=June 28, 2020}}</ref>

==Amanuensis Productions==
Vega has established her own recording label after the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 economic crisis]]. From that point, she stopped working for [[Blue Note Records]] and started thinking about re-recording her back catalog with new arrangements and gaining control over her works (which she eventually did with the ''[[Close-Up Series]]'').<ref name="sodajerker"/>

The name "Amanuensis Productions" was meant as a private joke about "servant" ([[amanuensis]]) owning the "masters" ([[audio mastering|recording masters]]), also a pun at [[A&M Records|A&M]] still legally owning her previous master tapes.<ref name="slugmag"/>

Running the label proved to be harder than she expected. In 2015, it barely "broke even", but new licenses were coming for "[[Tom's Diner]]".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.songwritingmagazine.co.uk/interviews/interview-suzanne-vega/23717 | title=Interview: Suzanne Vega | publisher=Songwriting | date=May 14, 2015 | access-date=August 2, 2016 | author=Deeks, Russell}}</ref>

==Personal life==
On March 17, 1995, Vega married [[Mitchell Froom]], a musician and a record producer (who played on and produced ''[[99.9F°]]'' and ''[[Nine Objects of Desire]]''). They have a daughter, Ruby Froom (born July 8, 1994). The band [[Soul Coughing]]'s ''[[Ruby Vroom]]'' album was named for her, with Vega's approval.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suzannevega.com/suzanne/funfacts/music.aspx |title=Fun Facts Music|publisher=Official Community of Suzanne Vega |access-date=August 22, 2008 |archive-url = https://archive.today/20080515164214/http://www.suzannevega.com/suzanne/funfacts/music.aspx <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = May 15, 2008}}</ref> Vega and Froom separated and divorced in 1998.
