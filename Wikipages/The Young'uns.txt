The members are Sean Cooney, David Eagle and Michael Hughes, who met as teenagers and encountered folk music as underage drinkers in a local pub. They enjoyed the music and returned to the Stockton Folk Club, where "One day someone said 'let's hear a song from the young'uns' and we sang this one verse we knew from a sea shanty", hence the band's name.<ref>{{cite news|title=How a happy accident launched vocal trio into the inclusive world of folk|url=http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/happy-accident-launched-vocal-trio-inclusive/story-16686540-detail/story.html|accessdate=14 April 2016|work=[[Western Morning News]]|date=10 August 2012}}</ref>
