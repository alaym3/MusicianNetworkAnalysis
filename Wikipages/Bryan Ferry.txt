Ferry came to prominence as the lead singer and main songwriter with the [[Glam rock|glam]] [[art rock]] band [[Roxy Music]], achieving three no. 1 albums and 10 singles which reached the top 10 in the UK between 1972 and 1982. Their singles included "[[Virginia Plain]]", "[[Street Life (Roxy Music song)|Street Life]]", "[[Love Is the Drug]]", "[[Dance Away]]", "[[Angel Eyes (Roxy Music song)|Angel Eyes]]", "[[Over You (Roxy Music song)|Over You]]", "[[Oh Yeah (Roxy Music song)|Oh Yeah]]", "[[Jealous Guy]]", "[[Avalon (Roxy Music song)|Avalon]]", and "[[More Than This (Roxy Music song)|More Than This]]".

Ferry began his solo career in 1973, while still a member of Roxy Music. His early solo hits include "[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]", "[[Let's Stick Together (song)|Let's Stick Together]]" and "[[This Is Tomorrow (Bryan Ferry song)|This Is Tomorrow]]". Ferry disbanded Roxy Music following the release of their best-selling album ''[[Avalon (Roxy Music album)|Avalon]]'' in 1982 to concentrate on his solo career, releasing further singles such as "[[Slave to Love]]" and "[[Don't Stop the Dance]]" and the UK no. 1 album ''[[Boys and Girls (album)|Boys and Girls]]'' in 1985.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=BRYAN FERRY {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/14894/bryan-ferry/|access-date=29 July 2021|website=www.officialcharts.com}}</ref> When his sales as a solo artist and as a member of Roxy Music are combined, Ferry has sold over 30 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bryan Ferry Signs Worldwide Partnership Deal with BMG Chrysalis U.K. |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bryan-ferry-signs-worldwide-partnership-384735 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=31 October 2012 |access-date=17 November 2016}}</ref>

As well as being a prolific songwriter himself, Ferry has recorded many cover versions of other artists' songs, including standards from the [[Great American Songbook]], in albums such as ''[[These Foolish Things (album)|These Foolish Things]]'' (1973), ''[[Another Time, Another Place (Bryan Ferry album)|Another Time, Another Place]]'' (1974), ''[[Let's Stick Together]]'' (1976) and ''[[As Time Goes By (Bryan Ferry album)|As Time Goes By]]'' (1999), as well as ''[[Dylanesque]]'' (2007), an album of [[Bob Dylan]] covers.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gittins |first=Ian |title=Bryan Ferry, Dylanesque |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/mar/02/popandrock.shopping6 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2 March 2007 |access-date=19 September 2018}}</ref> In 2019, Ferry was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of Roxy Music.<ref>{{cite web |title=Roxy Music |url=https://www.rockhall.com/2019-inductees/roxy-music |publisher=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame |year=2019 |access-date=13 December 2018}}</ref>

==Career==
===Roxy Music (1970–1983)===
{{Main|Roxy Music}}
[[File:Bryan Ferry (Roxy Music) - TopPop 1973 2 (crop).png|thumb|Ferry performing with Roxy Music on Dutch television in 1973]]Ferry formed Roxy Music with a group of friends and acquaintances, beginning with Graham Simpson, in November 1970. The line-up was expanded to include saxophonist/oboist [[Andy Mackay]] and [[Brian Eno]], an acquaintance who owned tape recorders and played Mackay's synthesiser. Other early members included timpanist Dexter Lloyd and ex-[[The Nice|Nice]] guitarist [[David O'List]], who were replaced respectively by [[Paul Thompson (musician)|Paul Thompson]] and [[Phil Manzanera]] before the band recorded its first album (early [[Peel Sessions]] for the UK's BBC Radio 1 feature O'List's playing).<ref>{{cite news|url= http://vivaroxymusic.com/reviews_2004_279.shtml|title= Getting Roxy Music in with 'The 'In' Crowd' – An Interview With Davy O'List|website=VivaRoxyMusic.com|date= 25 April 2004|access-date=15 June 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070515142126/http://vivaroxymusic.com/reviews_2004_279.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 15 May 2007}}</ref>

Roxy Music's first hit, "[[Virginia Plain]]", made the UK top 5 in 1972, and was followed up with several hit singles and albums, with Ferry as their lead vocalist and instrumentalist (he taught himself the piano in his mid-twenties) and Eno contributing synthesiser backing.<ref name="Michael Bracewell REMAKE REMODEL" />

After their second album, Brian Eno left Roxy Music, leaving Ferry its undisputed leader. Ferry started a parallel solo career in 1973, initially performing cover versions of old standards on albums such as ''[[These Foolish Things (album)|These Foolish Things]]'' (1973) and ''[[Another Time, Another Place (Bryan Ferry album)|Another Time, Another Place]]'' (1974), both of which reached the UK top 5.<ref name=":2" /> After the concert tour in support of their fifth studio album ''[[Siren (Roxy Music album)|Siren]]'', Roxy Music temporarily disbanded in 1976, though band members Paul Thompson, Phil Manzanera and [[Eddie Jobson]] took part in recording Ferry's subsequent solo material. That year Ferry covered the Beatles' "[[She's Leaving Home]]" for the transitory musical documentary ''[[All This and World War II]]''. He released three solo albums during this period, ''[[Let's Stick Together]]'' (1976), ''[[In Your Mind (album)|In Your Mind]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare (album)|The Bride Stripped Bare]]'' (1978), all of which charted in the UK top 20.<ref name=":2" />

Roxy Music reformed at the end of 1978 to record tracks for their sixth studio album ''[[Manifesto (Roxy Music album)|Manifesto]]'', which was released in early 1979 and reached no. 7 in the UK album charts, with Ferry, Manzanera, Thompson and Mackay. The follow-up was 1980's ''[[Flesh and Blood (Roxy Music album)|Flesh + Blood]]'', which reached no. 1 in the UK album charts, two years before the group's final studio release ''[[Avalon (Roxy Music album)|Avalon]]'' in 1982, which also reached no. 1 in the UK album charts.<ref>{{cite news

}}</ref> The band also achieved their first and only UK no. 1 single, "[[Jealous Guy]]", released in 1981 as a posthumous tribute to its author [[John Lennon]], who had been murdered two months earlier. It was the only one of their singles not to be written or co-written by Ferry.

After lengthy tours to promote the ''[[Avalon (Roxy Music album)|Avalon]]'' album, Ferry decided to disband Roxy Music in 1983 and continue as a solo artist.

===Solo years (1984–2001)===
Ferry's sixth solo album, ''[[Boys and Girls (album)|Boys and Girls]]'', reached no. 1 in the UK in June 1985, and was his first and only solo studio album to top the chart. ''Boys and Girls'' remained in the UK chart for 44 weeks and its lead single, "[[Slave to Love]]", reached the UK top ten.<ref>{{cite book |editor=David Roberts |title=British Hit Singles and Albums|year=2006|page=198|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|isbn=978-1904994107}}</ref> ''Boys and Girls'' also became his biggest selling album in the US.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} In July 1985, Ferry performed at the London [[Live Aid]] show, accompanied by [[Pink Floyd]] guitarist [[David Gilmour]].<ref>{{cite news

After the ''Avalon'' promotional tours, Ferry was rather reluctant to return to live touring on the road; however, a change of management persuaded him to resume touring in 1988 to promote the previous year's ''[[Bête Noire (album)|Bête Noire]]''. Following the tour, Ferry teamed again with Brian Eno for ''[[Mamouna]]'' (collaborating with [[Robin Trower]] on guitar and as producer). The album took more than five years to produce, and was created under the working title ''Horoscope''. During production, Ferry simultaneously recorded and released ''[[Taxi (Bryan Ferry album)|Taxi]]'' in 1993, which proved to be a greater commercial and critical success than ''Mamouna'' when it was finally released in 1994. In 1996, Ferry performed the song "Dance with Life" for the ''[[Phenomenon (film)|Phenomenon]]'' soundtrack, written by [[Bernie Taupin]] and [[Martin Page]].

In 1999, Ferry released ''[[As Time Goes By (Bryan Ferry album)|As Time Goes By]]'', an album of 1930s songs, which was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].<ref>{{cite news

===Roxy Music reunion (2001–2011)===
Ferry, Manzanera, Mackay and Thompson re-reformed Roxy Music in 2001 and toured extensively for a couple of years, though the band did not record any new material. In 2002, with the help of Manzanera and Thompson, Ferry returned with his next studio album ''[[Frantic (album)|Frantic]]'', which featured several tracks written with [[David A. Stewart]] as well as a collaboration with Brian Eno. The album was a mix of new original material and covers – something that Ferry had not attempted on a solo album since ''The Bride Stripped Bare'' in 1978.

In 2003, Ferry provided the entertainment for the [[Miss World]] contest.<ref>{{cite news

In March 2007, Ferry released the album ''[[Dylanesque (album)|Dylanesque]]'', an album of [[Bob Dylan]] songs with backing vocals from [[Tara McDonald]] and [[Anna McDonald]]. The album charted in the UK top 10, and Ferry undertook a UK tour. On 7 October 2008, Ferry was honoured as a [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] Icon at the annual BMI London Awards.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/537309 |title=Bryan Ferry Receives Icon Honours at BMI London Awards|website=Bmi.com|access-date=15 September 2010}}</ref>

In 2009, Ferry provided vocals on [[DJ Hell]]'s record ''U Can Dance''. The original version of the track was recorded for Ferry's new studio album ''[[Olympia (Bryan Ferry album)|Olympia]]'', released in October 2010. The album included some of the material he recorded with his former Roxy Music band members, and featured musicians such as [[Nile Rodgers]], [[David A. Stewart]], [[Scissor Sisters]], [[Groove Armada]], [[Michael "Flea" Balzary]], [[Jonny Greenwood]] and David Gilmour. The model [[Kate Moss]] was featured on the album cover.

Ferry also provided vocals for the song "Shameless" on Groove Armada's 2010 album ''[[Black Light (Groove Armada album)|Black Light]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/b8rj/ | title= Groove Armada Black Light Review|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=2010|access-date=18 August 2018}}</ref> The album received a nomination for the 53rd Grammy Awards in the category [[Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album|Best Electronic/Dance Album]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/groove-armada|title=Groove Armada|date=22 May 2018|website=Grammy.com|access-date=2 December 2018}}</ref>

In 2011, Roxy Music performed together for the last time to date as Ferry, Phil Manzanera and Andy Mackay embarked on a world tour to celebrate the group's 40th anniversary.

===After Roxy Music (2011–present)===
In June 2011, Ferry was made a [[CBE]] in the Queen's Birthday Honours for his contribution to the British music industry, and in 2012 he was awarded the French national honour of Officier de l'ordre des Arts et des Lettres.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bruce Forsyth knighthood heads Queen's Birthday Honours |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13728375 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=11 June 2011}}</ref> In 2014, Ferry was made an honorary Doctor of Music by Newcastle University.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/488338/Bryan-Ferry-Doctor-of-Music-Newcastle-University|title=Roxy Music's Bryan Ferry receives honorary degree from Newcastle University|date=12 July 2014|website=[[Daily Express]]|access-date=2 December 2018}}</ref>

On 26 November 2012, he released a new album entitled ''[[The Jazz Age (The Bryan Ferry Orchestra album)|The Jazz Age]]'' with [[the Bryan Ferry Orchestra]]. The album features 1920s period jazz renditions of some of Ferry's songs (from both his solo discography and with Roxy Music). Film director [[Baz Luhrmann]] asked to use Ferry's song "Love Is the Drug" from ''The Jazz Age'' album for the 2013 film ''[[The Great Gatsby (2013 film)|The Great Gatsby]]''. This resulted in a collaboration with The Bryan Ferry Orchestra to create several jazz pieces throughout the movie, released as a separate album titled ''The Great Gatsby – The Jazz Recordings (A Selection of Yellow Cocktail Music)''. Ferry began touring with The Bryan Ferry Orchestra in 2013, including a performance at the [[2013 Cannes Film Festival]] which was opened by Luhrmann's ''Great Gatsby'' film.

==Personal life==
===Style===
In addition to his contributions to music, Ferry has also come to be known for his distinctive style and artistic sensibilities. In 2005, ''[[GQ]]'' presented Ferry with its Lifetime Achievement Award, deeming him "pop's original art-school bobby-dazzler" and noting his solo career spent as the "world's best-dressed and most languidly mannered deluxe chanteur".<ref>{{cite web |last=Mills |first=Simon |title=2005: Bryan Ferry |url=https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/bryan-ferry-2005-lifetime-achievement |website=Gq-magazine.co.uk |date=29 August 2012 |access-date=2 December 2018}}</ref> ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' has noted Ferry's lifelong obsession with clothing and describing any in-person interaction with him as a "bespoke event, a louche ensemble of elegant affectations".<ref>{{cite web |title=Brian Ferry: Style Icon |url=https://www.esquire.com/uk/style/news/a9312/brian-ferry-style-icon/ |website=Esquire.com |date=8 January 2016 |access-date=2 December 2018}}</ref> In 2007, Belgian fashion designer [[Dries van Noten]] created a Fall 2007 collection inspired by outfits Ferry wore during his solo career and tenure with Roxy Music.<ref>{{cite news|last=Iannacci|first=Elio|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/ferry-tails/article696296/|title=Ferry tails|work=Globe and Mail|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref>

In his 1976 essay "Them", cultural critic [[Peter York]] described Ferry as "the best possible example of the ultimate art-directed existence" and suggested he was the most important pasticheur in Britain at the time.<ref name="google1"/> Ferry has credited numerous art and film influences throughout his career, among them [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], and [[Humphrey Bogart]]. Hamilton is credited by Ferry as an inspiration to him both as an artist and as a person, and is also responsible for introducing Ferry as an art student to Duchamp's work. The title of Ferry's 1978 solo album ''The Bride Stripped Bare'' is taken from Duchamp's classic work ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-14916357|title=Ferry leads tributes to Hamilton|date=14 September 2011|access-date=2 December 2018|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> For Bogart, Ferry penned the song "[[2HB]]" ("2HB" = "To Humphrey Bogart"), leading the band [[Madness (band)|Madness]] to record "4BF" ("for Bryan Ferry"), on their 1988 album ''[[The Madness (The Madness album)|The Madness]]''. Phil Manzanera – who would become Roxy Music's guitarist – recalls, during his audition to join the band, that Ferry and he discussed Humphrey Bogart and classic films from the golden age of Hollywood.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/roxy-music-postmodern-masterpiece/|title=Roxy Music: Deconstructing Rock's First Postmodern Masterpiece|website=Udiscovermusic.com|access-date=2 December 2018}}</ref>

===Relationships and family===
In 1975, Ferry began a relationship with model [[Jerry Hall]]; they first met when she appeared on the album cover for ''[[Siren (Roxy Music album)|Siren]]'', which was photographed in Wales during the summer of 1975. According to ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', the photoshoot boosted Hall's status as an international celebrity.<ref>{{cite news |title=Jerry Hall: The Interview |url=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/news/a625/jerry-hall-interview/ |work=[[Harper's Bazaar]] |access-date=18 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=The Many Romances of Jerry Hall |url=https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/g2037/jerry-hall-relationships-men/ |work=Town and Country Magazine |access-date=18 August 2018}}</ref> Her stay at Ferry's Holland Park (London) home, following the album cover photo shoot, marked the start of their relationship. Hall and Ferry lived together, sharing homes in London and in the Bel Air district of Los Angeles, and Hall also appeared in some of Ferry's solo music videos, including "Let's Stick Together" and "The Price of Love" (both 1976).<ref>{{cite news |title=Bryan Ferry: "People like you to be difficult and weird" |url=https://www.uncut.co.uk/features/bryan-ferry-people-like-difficult-weird-103600/2 |work=Uncut Magazine |access-date=18 August 2018}}</ref> Their relationship ended when she left him for [[Mick Jagger]] in late 1977.

Ferry rarely talks about Hall, but fans have often speculated that his song "[[Kiss and Tell (Bryan Ferry song)|Kiss and Tell]]" from his album ''[[Bête Noire (album)|Bête Noire]]'' (1987) was his response to Hall's tell-all book about their relationship, published a couple of years earlier.<ref>{{cite news |title=Songfacts: Kiss And Tell by Bryan Ferry |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=8268 |work=Songfacts |access-date=10 August 2007}}</ref> Additionally, Ferry's 1978 solo album ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare (album)|The Bride Stripped Bare]]'' is widely believed<ref>{{cite news |last=Myers |first=Stephanie R. |title=Jerry Hall Prefers Rockers Over Brad Pitt |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Jerry-Hall-Prefers-Rockers-Over-Brad-Pitt-7387.shtml |publisher=Softpedia |access-date=10 August 2007}}</ref> to contain allusions to his break-up with Hall – particularly the song "When She Walks in the Room".

On 26 June 1982, Ferry married London socialite [[Lucy Helmore]], who had become pregnant with their child Otis (b. 1 November 1982). Although her face is not seen, Helmore was the model on the front cover of Roxy Music's album ''[[Avalon (Roxy Music album)|Avalon]]'' (1982), released a month before their wedding.<ref name="Helmore1">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3683752.stm|title=Faces of the Week|date=24 September 2004|work=BBC News|access-date=17 November 2014}}</ref> The couple had three more sons, Isaac,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tatler.com/the-tatler-list/f/isaac-ferry|title=Isaac Ferry|work=Tatler|access-date=17 November 2014}}</ref> Tara, and Merlin.<ref name="Helmore1"/> After 21 years of marriage the couple divorced in 2003.

In 2000, the whole Ferry family were on [[British Airways Flight 2069]] to Nairobi when a passenger forced his way into the cockpit, attacked the pilot and caused the plane to lurch downwards.

===Politics===
In 1988, Ferry referred to himself as "sort of [[Conservatism|conservative]]" in his beliefs in an interview with the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.

In 2007, controversy arose when Ferry praised the imagery and iconography of [[Nazi Germany]] in an interview with the German newspaper ''[[Welt am Sonntag]]'', citing in particular "[[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s movies and [[Albert Speer]]'s buildings and the mass parades and the flags". In the same interview Ferry was reported to have referred to his West London recording studio as "[[Führerbunker|The Führerbunker]]" ([[Adolf Hitler]]'s bunker during World War II).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/wams_print/article744996/Ich_waere_gern_ein_Amateur.html|title=Ich wäre gern ein Amateur|newspaper=Die Welt|language=de|date=4 March 2007|access-date=17 April 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=16 April 2007|title=Nazi Ferry gaffe|publisher=SomethingJewish|url=http://www.somethingjewish.co.uk/articles/2280_nazi_ferry_gaffe.htm|url-status=dead|access-date=17 April 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522135024/http://www.somethingjewish.co.uk/articles/2280_nazi_ferry_gaffe.htm|archive-date=22 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Ferry apologises for Nazi remarks |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6561177.stm |publisher=BBC News|date=16 April 2007}}</ref> Ferry later issued a public apology for any offence caused by the comments.<ref>{{cite news |last=Beckford |first=Martin |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1548818/Bryan-Ferry-apologises-for-Nazi-comments.html |title=Bryan Ferry apologises for Nazi comments |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=17 April 2007 |access-date=19 September 2018}}</ref> [[British Jews|Jewish]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] peer [[Greville Janner]] criticised Ferry for his remarks.

In 2008, Ferry indicated that he supported the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], referring to himself as "conservative by nature" but essentially [[apolitical]], preferring not to mix art with politics. Without elaborating, he stated he was "proud" of his son Otis and described the then Labour Government's [[Hunting Act 2004|ban on fox hunting]] as "futile". He also expressed an opposition to "[[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] bitterness" and [[political correctness]], arguing both were stifling to individual liberty and freedom of expression.
