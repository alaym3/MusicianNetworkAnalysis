'''Arnold George Dorsey''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|MBE}} (born 2 May 1936), known professionally as '''Engelbert Humperdinck''', is a British [[Pop music|pop]] singer. His singles "[[Release Me (Eddie Miller song)|Release Me]]" and "[[The Last Waltz (song)|The Last Waltz]]" both topped the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1967, selling more than a million copies each.<ref>{{cite web|title=Engelbert Humperdinck|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/17134/ENGELBERT-HUMPERDINCK/|website=Official Charts|publisher=The Official UK Charts Company|access-date=2 April 2015}}</ref> Humperdinck scored further major hits including "[[Am I That Easy to Forget]]" and "[[Quando m'innamoro|A Man Without Love]]"; three of his singles were among [[List of best-selling singles of the 1960s in the United Kingdom|the best-selling of the 1960s in the United Kingdom]]. During the 1970s, he had North American chart successes with "[[After the Lovin']]" (1976) and "[[This Moment in Time]]" (1979).

==Early life==
Arnold George Dorsey was born in [[Chennai|Madras]], British India (now [[Chennai|Chennai, India]]) in 1936,<ref name=who>''The Complete Marquis Who's Who'' (2010)</ref> one of ten children to [[British Army]] [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]] Mervyn Dorsey, who was of Welsh descent, and his wife Olive, who, according to the singer, was of German descent.<ref name="ethnicity">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/9286779/Engelbert-Humperdinck-Britains-Eurovision-entry-insists-My-heart-is-with-the-Germans.html|title=Engelbert Humperdinck, Britain's Eurovision entry, insists: 'My heart is with the Germans'|publisher=Telegraph.co.uk|date= 24 May 2012|access-date=24 March 2014|location=London, UK|first=Hannah|last=Furness}}</ref><ref>''[[The Age]]'', 2 August 2002 - [https://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/08/01/1028157814768.html Children of the Raj celebrate their unique heritage]</ref><ref>''[[BBC News]]'', 4 January 2013  - [https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20857969 Anglo-Indians: Is their culture dying out?]</ref><ref name="auto1">''[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]]'', Sunday , 16 September 2012 - [https://www.telegraphindia.com/1120916/jsp/7days/story_15982272.jsp Made in India]</ref> Various sources also say that he has [[Anglo-Indian]] heritage.<ref>''The Age'', 2 August 2002 - [https://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/08/01/1028157814768.html Children of the Raj celebrate their unique heritage]</ref><ref>''[[BBC News]]'', 4 January 2013  - [http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20857969 Anglo-Indians: Is their culture dying out?]</ref><ref name="auto1"/> His family moved to [[Leicester]], England, when he was ten years old. He later showed an interest in music and began learning the saxophone. By the early 1950s, he was playing saxophone in nightclubs, but he is believed not to have begun singing until he was in his late teens. His impression of [[Jerry Lewis]] prompted friends to begin calling him "Gerry Dorsey", a name that he worked under for almost a decade.<ref name="ReferenceA">Stark, Herbert Alick. Hostages To India: OR The Life Story of the Anglo Indian Race. Third Edition. London: The Simon Wallenberg Press: Vol 2: Anglo Indian Heritage Books.<!-- ISBN needed --></ref>

Dorsey's attempt to get his music career off the ground was interrupted by [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|conscription]] into the British Army [[Royal Corps of Signals]] during the mid-1950s. Later, he got his first chance to record in 1958 with [[Decca Records]] after his discharge. His first single "I'll Never Fall in Love Again" was not a hit, but Dorsey recorded for the same company almost a decade later with very different results. He continued working the nightclubs but in 1961, he was stricken with [[tuberculosis]]. He eventually regained his health and returned to nightclub work, but with little success.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-38661892|title=BBC News – Bizarre Names in Music|work=BBC News|date=19 January 2017}}</ref>

==Career==
===Changes and "Release Me"===
In 1965, Dorsey teamed up with [[Gordon Mills]], his former roommate whilst in [[Bayswater]], London, who had become a music impresario and the manager of [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Mills, aware that Dorsey had been struggling for several years to become successful in the music industry, suggested a name-change to the more arresting ''Engelbert Humperdinck'', borrowed from the [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|19th-century German composer of operas]] such as ''[[Hansel and Gretel (opera)|Hansel and Gretel]]''.<ref name="AllMusic bio"/> Humperdinck enjoyed his first real success during July 1966 in [[Belgium]], where he and four others represented Britain in the annual [[Knokke]] song contest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europopmusic.eu/What%20is%20Europopmusic/Knokke_festival_contestants.html|title=Knokke – Heist songfestival contestants 1959–1973|publisher=Europopmusic.eu|access-date=29 October 2011}}</ref> Three months later in October 1966, he was on stage in [[Mechelen]]. He made a mark on the Belgian charts with "Dommage, Dommage", and an early music video was filmed with him in the harbour of [[Zeebrugge]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6yPObnNPIE|title=Engelbert – Dommage Dommage|publisher=YouTube|access-date=29 October 2011}}</ref>

In the mid-1960s, Humperdinck visited German songwriter [[Bert Kaempfert]] at his house in Spain and was offered arrangements of three songs: "[[Moon Over Naples|Spanish Eyes]]"; "[[Strangers in the Night]]" and "[[Wonderland by Night]]". He returned to Britain where he recorded all three songs. He recognised the potential of "Strangers in the Night" and asked manager Gordon Mills whether it could be released as a single—but his request was refused, since the song had already been requested by [[Frank Sinatra]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01h6042 |title=BBC Radio 2 - The Chris Evans Breakfast Show, Engelbert Humperdinck joins us for Breakfast |website=Bbc.co.uk |date=11 May 2012 |access-date=12 July 2017}}</ref>

In early 1967, the changes paid off when Humperdinck's version of "[[Release Me (Eddie Miller song)|Release Me]]" made the top ten on both sides of the Atlantic and number one in Britain, recorded in a smooth ballad style with a full chorus joining him on the third refrain, and keeping [[The Beatles]]' "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]"/"[[Penny Lane]]" from the top slot in the United Kingdom. His song "[[Ten Guitars]]", a B-side on the single "Release Me" became a huge hit in New Zealand.<ref name=stuff>{{cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/music/110379258/engelbert-humperdinck-still-shocked-by-success-of-ten-guitars|title=Engelbert Humperdinck still shocked by success of 'Ten Guitars'|date=8 February 2019|access-date=20 February 2019}}</ref> Another groundbreaking video showed Engelbert tied up with a lasso. "Release Me" spent 56 weeks in the Top 50 in a single chart run.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/The%20Last%20Waltz|title=Release Me|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|access-date=23 September 2008}}</ref> "Release Me" was believed to have sold 85,000 copies a day at the height of its popularity, and it was the best known of his songs for years.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Humperdinck's easygoing style and good looks earned him a large following, particularly among women. His hardcore female fans called themselves "Humperdinckers".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/entertainment-arts-17230618|title=Engelbert Humperdinck: the man behind the name|first=Kev|last=Geoghegan|work=bbc.co.uk|date=2 March 2012|access-date=2 March 2012}}</ref> "Release Me" was succeeded by two more hit ballads: "[[There Goes My Everything (song)|There Goes My Everything]]" and "[[The Last Waltz (song)|The Last Waltz]]", earning him a reputation as a [[crooner]], a description which he disputed. As Humperdinck told ''[[Hollywood Reporter]]'' writer Rick Sherwood:<blockquote>"[I]f you are not a crooner it's something you don't want to be called. No crooner has the range I have. I can hit notes a bank could not cash. What I am is a contemporary singer, a stylised performer."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Engelbert Humperdinck {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/music-history-composers-and-performers-biographies/engelbert-humperdinck#:~:text=As%20Humperdinck%20told%20the%20Hollywood,a%20bank%20couldn%27t%20cash.|access-date=2021-02-22|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}</ref></blockquote>

In 1968, following his major successes the previous year, Humperdinck reached No. 2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] with "A Man Without Love", and the album of the same name climbed to No. 3.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/A%20Man%20Without%20Love|title=Artist: Engelbert Humperdinck, Title: A Man Without Love|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|access-date=18 May 2012}}</ref> Another single, "[[Les Bicyclettes de Belsize (song)|Les Bicyclettes de Belsize]]",<ref>''Billboard'', 16 November 1968 - [https://books.google.com/books?id=r0UEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA71&dq=Les+Bicyclettes+de+Belsize+Billboard&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiv89PZxKzkAhWNe30KHYBODcUQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&q=Les%20Bicyclettes%20de%20Belsize%20Billboard&f=false Page 71 Billboard HITS OF THE WORLD]</ref><ref>[[Les Bicyclettes de Belsize]]</ref> was a top 10 hit in the United Kingdom and reached the top 40 in the United States. By the end of the decade, Humperdinck's expanding roster of songs also included "[[Am I That Easy to Forget]]", "The Way It Used to Be", "[[I'm a Better Man (For Having Loved You)]]" (written by [[Burt Bacharach]] and [[Hal David]]) and "[[Winter World of Love]]". He supplemented these big-selling singles with a number of equally successful albums. These albums include ''Release Me'', ''The Last Waltz'', ''A Man Without Love'', and ''Engelbert Humperdinck''. For six months in 1969–70, Humperdinck fronted his own television series ''The Engelbert Humperdinck Show'' for [[Associated Television|ATV]] in the United Kingdom, and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the US. In this musical variety format, he was joined by, among others, [[Paul Anka]], [[Shirley Bassey]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Jack Benny]], [[Milton Berle]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Four Tops]], [[Lena Horne]], [[Liberace]], [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], [[Carmen McRae]], [[Dusty Springfield]], [[Jack Jones (singer)|Jack Jones]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] and [[Dionne Warwick]]. 

===1970s===
By the start of the 1970s, Humperdinck had settled into a busy schedule of recordings, and a number of signature songs emerged from this period, often written by noted musicians and songwriters; among them, "We Made It Happen" (written by [[Paul Anka]]),<ref>{{cite web|author=Joe Viglione|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/we-made-it-happen-mw0000872177|title=We Made It Happen – Engelbert Humperdinck &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards|website=AllMusic|access-date=24 March 2014}}</ref> "[[Sweetheart (Bee Gees song)|Sweetheart]]" (written by [[Barry Gibb]] and [[Maurice Gibb]]),<ref>{{cite web|author=Engelbert Humperdinck|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/we-made-it-happen-sweetheart-mw0000823928|title=We Made It Happen/Sweetheart – Engelbert Humperdinck &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards|website=AllMusic |date=11 August 2009|access-date=24 March 2014}}</ref> "Another Time, Another Place", and "[[Too Beautiful to Last]]" (theme from the film [[Nicholas and Alexandra]]). In 1972, he starred in another television series, for [[BBC 1]]. Titled ''Engelbert with [[Dougie Squires|The Young Generation]]'', the show ran for thirteen weeks, and featured the dance troupe, regular guests [[the Goodies]] and [[Marlene Charell]], and international stars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/search/0/20?order=asc&q=%22engelbert+with+the+young+generation%22#search|title=Search Results - BBC Genome|website=Genome.ch.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Also in 1972, he was among the guests in [[David Winters (choreographer)|David Winters]]' musical television special ''[[The Special London Bridge Special]]'', starring [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], and [[Jennifer O'Neill]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=6 May 1972|title=Lake Havasu city plays a starring role in special|page=12-D|work=Colorado Springs Gazette-Telegraph}}</ref>

By the middle of the decade, Humperdinck concentrated on selling albums and on live performances, with his style of balladry less popular on the singles charts. He developed lavish stage productions, making him a natural for [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] and similar venues. He performed regularly at the [[Riviera (hotel and casino)|Riviera Hotel]] in Las Vegas through the early and middle years of the decade, recording a live album at the venue with [[the Three Degrees]] as backing singers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Three Degrees: The story of the band (Part Two): "The Roulette years, 1968–1973"|url=http://3degrees.eg2.fr/page_roulette_70_73_uk.htm|access-date=20 February 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226202657/http://3degrees.eg2.fr/page_roulette_70_73_uk.htm|archive-date=26 February 2014}}</ref>

In 1976, Humperdinck's commercial credentials were buoyed by "[[After the Lovin']]", a ballad produced by Joel Diamond and released by [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS]] subsidiary Epic. The song was a top 10 hit in the US<ref name=AMG66965>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/after-the-lovin-r66965/charts-awards/billboard-single|title=After the Lovin' – Engelbert Humperdinck|website=AllMusic|access-date=29 October 2011}}</ref> and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]], went Gold, and won the "most played juke box record of the year" award. The album of the same name reached the top 20 on the US charts,<ref name=AMG66965/> and was a Double Platinum hit for the singer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH|title=Recording Industry Association of America|publisher=RIAA|access-date=29 October 2011}}</ref> Three of the album tracks were produced by [[Bobby Eli]] and recorded at the [[Sigma Sound Studios]] in Philadelphia. As critics point out, the singer's unexpected foray into the "Philadelphia Sound" was successful, adding to the overall strength of the work.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Elias|first1=Jason|title=After the Lovin'|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/after-the-lovin-mw0000872684|website=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=Allmusic/All Media Network|access-date=7 April 2015}}</ref> Rounding off the year, Humperdinck made his first appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' with a live performance of the hit single.<ref>{{cite web|title=Engelbert Humperdinck performs "After the Lovin" during his first appearance on "The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson" in 1976|website = [[YouTube]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6vSPQ44fbE|access-date=20 February 2014}}</ref>
Joel Diamond went on to produce a series of albums recorded by Humperdinck for Epic, including ''This Moment in Time'' from 1979 (the title song topped the US adult contemporary charts)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/engelbert-humperdinck-p14870/charts-awards/billboard-singles|title=Engelbert Humperdinck|website=AllMusic|date=2 May 1936|access-date=29 October 2011}}</ref> and two Christmas albums. In 1979, following his late-decade chart successes stateside, Humperdinck took his stage show to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] with appearances at the [[Minskoff Theatre]].

===1980s and 1990s===
In the 1980s, Humperdinck consolidated his discography, recording regularly and performing as many as 200 concerts a year while continuing with headlining appearances in Las Vegas at the Hilton Hotel ([[Westgate Las Vegas Resort & Casino]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Las Vegas Hilton: Looking Back|url=http://www.ratevegas.com/blog/2012/01/the_las_vegas_h.html|access-date=3 May 2015}}</ref> In the early and mid-1980s, he made a number of special appearances as an actor on popular television dramas of the time, including ''[[The Love Boat]]'', ''[[Hotel (U.S. TV series)|Hotel]]'' and ''[[Fantasy Island]]''.

Following his stint as a recording artist with Epic, he released what William Ruhlmann has called an "ambitious double album" titled ''A Lovely Way to Spend An Evening'' (1985). Ruhlmann commends Humperdinck for recording this album of standards from the American Songbook; he notes that the work "was a long time coming", while acknowledging that "the album deserved a broader distribution than it received."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ruhlmann|first1=William|title=A Lovely Way To Spend An Evening|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-lovely-way-to-spend-an-evening-silver-eagle-mw0000948693|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=4 May 2015}}</ref> The album was released in the United Kingdom as ''Getting Sentimental'' and reached the UK Top-40 album charts in the summer of 1985.<ref>{{cite web|title=Official Charts – Getting Sentimental|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/GETTING%20SENTIMENTAL/|website=Official Charts|publisher=The Official UK Charts Company|access-date=4 May 2015}}</ref>

In the following years, Humperdinck continued with studio recordings, including a duet with [[Gloria Gaynor]] for his 1987 album ''Remember, I Love You''<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite web|author=Artist Biography by Steve Huey|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/engelbert-humperdinck-mn0000098081/biography|title=Engelbert Humperdinck: Biography|website=AllMusic|access-date=24 March 2014}}</ref> In 1989, he recorded ''Step into My Life'' (released as ''Ich Denk An Dich'' in Germany). Songs on the album were written by songwriters and musicians such as [[Dieter Bohlen]] and [[Barry Mason]]. It spawned several singles: "Red Roses for My Lady", "I Wanna Rock You in My Wildest Dreams", and a version of Dieter Bohlen's first hit from the album ''[[The 1st Album (Modern Talking album)|The 1st Album]]'', "[[You're My Heart, You're My Soul]]".<ref name="COV">{{cite web |url= http://www.moderntalking.ru/real/index_eng.htm |title= Cover Versions |publisher= Moderntalking.ru |access-date= 26 November 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090901222958/http://www.moderntalking.ru/real/index_eng.htm |archive-date= 1 September 2009 |url-status= dead }}</ref>

Humperdinck was awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 1989 and won a [[Golden Globe Award]] as entertainer of the year, while also beginning major involvement in charitable causes such as the Leukemia Research Fund, the [[American Red Cross]], the [[American Lung Association]], and several AIDS relief organisations. He wrote a song for one charity-group titled "Reach Out" (released on his 1992 studio album ''Hello Out There''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/hello-out-there-mw0000181252|title=Hello out There – Engelbert Humperdinck: Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards|website=AllMusic|access-date=24 March 2014}}</ref>).

Musical appraisals of Humperdinck's career in the 1990s point to him earning "a new hip cachet" during the [[Lounge music|Lounge Revival]], and note the success of new artistic ventures such as his recording of "[[Lesbian Seagull]]" for the soundtrack of the film ''[[Beavis and Butt-head Do America]]'' (1996), and his dance album from 1998.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> 1995's ''Love Unchained'', produced by [[Bebu Silvetti]], peaked in the UK Top-20 album charts, marking a return to form in his home country.<ref>{{cite web|title=Engelbert Humperdinck {{!}} Artist|work=Official Charts|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/engelbert%20humperdinck|access-date=20 February 2014}}</ref> He retained a public profile during these years, making numerous appearances on radio and television, including the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' and ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', and at events such as the [[1996 Daytona 500]], where he performed "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]".<ref>{{cite book|author1=John Roberts|title=The Great Book of NASCAR Lists|date=10 January 2012|isbn=9780762446384|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b8dgmJAvN9UC&q=engelbert+1996+daytona&pg=PT132|access-date=20 April 2015}}</ref>

In 1988, Humperdinck filed a libel suit against the ''[[National Enquirer]]''. The origin of the libelous statements was said to be Kathy Jetter, the mother of Humperdinck's illegitimate child, and were made in an affidavit filed by Jetter in New York Family Court in an effort to increase child support payments from Humperdinck. Jetter lost the action.<ref>"First Off ...", ''Los Angeles Times'' (29 December 1988)</ref> Jetter had successfully brought a paternity suit against Humperdinck following the birth of her daughter Jennifer in 1977.<ref>{{cite web | title=Court Upholds Paternity Ruling against Singer |newspaper=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]| date=26 March 1981 | url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/100432649/ | access-date=12 April 2020}}</ref>

===2000s===
[[File:Cowboy humpy 10-31-2008.JPG|thumb|upright|Humperdinck performing in 2008.]]
Humperdinck's recording career has continued into the new millennium, with a range of musical collaborations. In 2000, he hit the top five of the British album charts with ''Engelbert at His Very Best'', and returned to the top five four years later, after he appeared in a [[John Smith's]] TV-advertisement. In the spring of 2003, Humperdinck collaborated with the American [[Grammy Award]]-winning artist-producer [[Art Greenhaw]] to record the roots gospel album ''Always Hear the Harmony: The Gospel Sessions''; joining Humperdinck on the album were the [[Light Crust Doughboys]], [[the Jordanaires]] and [[the Blackwood Brothers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/always-hear-the-harmony-the-gospel-sessions-mw0000324053/credits|title=Always Hear the Harmony: The Gospel Sessions - Engelbert Humperdinck - Credits - AllMusic|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2 October 2018}}</ref> The critically acclaimed album was nominated for a Grammy for "Best Southern, Country or Bluegrass Gospel Album of the Year", while Humperdinck was photographed with generations of fans at the 2004 Grammy Awards in Los Angeles. He was back in the studio soon after, releasing ''Let There Be Love'' in 2005. Music critics have remarked on the historical span of material in the album, from songs first made popular in the 1920s to more recent ones from the 1990s, and point especially to Humperdinck's version of [[Nick Lowe]]'s "You Inspire Me" as a noteworthy cut.<ref>{{cite web|author=William Ruhlmann|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/let-there-be-love-mw0000259149|title=Let There Be Love – Engelbert Humperdinck|website=AllMusic|date=29 March 2005|access-date=24 March 2014}}</ref> In 2007, Humperdinck released ''The Winding Road''. In a conversation with [[Larry King]], Humperdinck discussed the genesis of the album; he pointed out that ''The Winding Road'' featured songs exclusively by British composers, as a "tribute to [his] home country", released as it was to mark 40 years since his first international hit recording.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0711/11/lkl.01.html|title=Larry King Live - Interviews with Danielle Steel, Tom Brokaw, Deborah Norville, Ed McMahon, Engelbert Humperdinck|work=CNN|access-date=24 March 2014}}</ref>

[[File:Engelbert Humperdinck (singer).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Humperdinck in 2008]]

During the recording of the [[Gorillaz]] album ''[[Plastic Beach]]'', Humperdinck was asked by [[Damon Albarn]] to contribute to the album as a guest artist. The singer's management at the time, however, declined the offer without Humperdinck's knowledge. Describing the event, Humperdinck stated that the missed opportunity was, "the most grievous sin ever committed", and that he would have gladly collaborated with Gorillaz. He added that he had since parted ways with his then-management, handing over duties to his son, Scott Dorsey. At the end of the interview, Humperdinck observed: "I'd really like to rekindle that suggestion again and bring it back. Hopefully they will ask me again.
