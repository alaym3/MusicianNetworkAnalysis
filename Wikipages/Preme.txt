==Career==
Preme, also known as '''The King''', the '''King of Da North''', released his debut solo single in 2008 entitled "You Know I'm Fly", which topped the [[PunchMuch]] Canadian interactive music channel. His follow-up singles are "Money in My Pocket" (2009) and "In My Hood" (2010), produced by [[T-Minus (producer)|T-Minus]]. He is known as Preme because of his [[preterm birth]], Preme being a changed spelling of "preemie", which is slang for premature.

[[Francis and the Lights]], [[k-os]], and Reign all toured with [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]] on his [[Away from Home Tour]] across North America. Reign performed as an opening act. Due to legal troubles at the time, Reign was not able to cross into the United States and thus toured only in Canadian cities.

[[Alyssa Reid]]'s big international hit "[[Alone Again (Alyssa Reid song)|Alone Again]]" features P Reign. The single was a hit in Canada and many European charts and reached number 2 on [[UK Singles Chart]]. Canadian band [[Hedley (band)|Hedley]]'s hit "Invincible" taken from their album ''[[Storms (Hedley album)|Storms]]'' features P Reign. The single released August 23, 2011 reached number 9 on [[Canadian Hot 100]] and was certified double platinum.

''The Canadian Dream'' is his debut mixtape and was released in early 2008. His sophomore mixtape is called ''When It Reigns It Pours'' and was released on November 1, 2010. His third mixtape was to be called ''True Kings Don't Die'' but was changed to ''Dear America'' and its release date was scheduled for July 4, 2013 but was postponed and released under Sony/RCA as an EP. He also still release a mixtape a week later with additional songs also called Dear America. ''Billboard'' magazine reported in March 2013 that P Reign is collaborating with rapper [[ASAP Rocky|A$AP Rocky]] for the next release "We Them Niggas" that was a part of P Reign's ''Dear America'' EP. P Reign is also collaborating with artists such as [[French Montana]], [[Waka Flocka Flame]] and Drake.<ref name=billboard/> The EP was finally released on September 9, 2014. His song "Realest in the City" featuring [[Meek Mill]] and [[PartyNextDoor]] reached #1 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s "Emerging Artists" chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://realtime.billboard.com/?chart=emergingartists|title=Charts - Billboard}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Preme has a son who was born in 2006.

In 2008, Reign was charged with nine counts of weapons possession charges after Toronto Police found three loaded handguns in the backseat of his leased Cadillac.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/article/956706--rapper-denies-knowledge-of-loaded-guns-in-his-car|title=Rapper denies knowledge of loaded guns in his car - The Star}}</ref> He was acquitted of all charges on May 30, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/article/999499--toronto-rapper-p-reign-acquitted-of-weapons-charges?bn=1|title=Toronto rapper P. Reign acquitted of weapons charges - The Star}}</ref> Preme referenced this on the unofficial remix to the song "Us" by [[Lil Reese]] rapping, "Drizzy dropped a hundred on my lawyer and I beat the case!"

Preme is close friends with fellow Torontonian rapper [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopcanada.com/2010/06/p-reign-shoots-video-for-in-my-hood-newsphotos/|title=HipHopCanada: P Reign shoots video for "In My Hood"}}</ref> and both have alluded to this on respective tracks. In the song "Intro" of his second mixtape, Reign raps "Shout out to Drizzy [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]], yeah that's my lil' bro / before the deal, we gettin' change like the corner store." [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]] raps in the remake to Big Page's single "I'm Still Fly", "My brother P Reign knows we fuck with the same hoes / Plus he taught me how to spot an officer in plain clothes."<ref name=billboard>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/1554202/aap-rocky-p-reign-talk-we-them-ni-as-collaboration-exclusive|title=A$AP Rocky, P.
