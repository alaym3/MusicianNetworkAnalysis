"Camera obscura" can also refer to analogous constructions such as a box or tent in which an exterior image is projected inside. Camera obscuras with a lens in the opening have been used since the second half of the 16th century and became popular as aids for drawing and painting. The concept was developed further into the [[Camera|photographic camera]] in the first half of the 19th century, when camera obscura boxes were used to expose light-sensitive materials to the projected image.

The camera obscura was used to study eclipses without the risk of damaging the eyes by looking directly into the sun. As a drawing aid, it allowed tracing the projected image to produce a highly accurate representation, and was especially appreciated as an easy way to achieve proper [[graphical perspective]].

Before the term ''camera obscura'' was first used in 1604, other terms were used to refer to the devices: ''cubiculum obscurum'', ''cubiculum tenebricosum'', ''conclave obscurum'', and ''locus obscurus''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Optic projection, principles, installation, and use of the magic lantern, projection microscope, reflecting lantern, moving picture machine|publisher=Comstock Publishing Company|year=1914|last=Phelps Gage|first=Henry|url=https://archive.org/details/opticprojection01gagegoog|quote=obscurum cubiculum.}}</ref>

A camera obscura without a lens but with a very small hole is sometimes referred to as a [[pinhole camera]], although this more often refers to simple (homemade) lensless cameras where photographic film or photographic paper is used.

==Physical explanation==
Rays of light travel in straight lines and change when they are reflected and partly absorbed by an object, retaining information about the color and brightness of the surface of that object. Lighted objects reflect rays of light in all directions. A small enough opening in a barrier admits only the rays that travel directly from different points in the scene on the other side, and these rays form an image of that scene where they reach a surface opposite from the opening.<ref name="amateur work">{{cite book |title=Amateur work, illustrated|volume=4|chapter=The Camera Obscura: Its Uses, Action, and Construction| last = Standage | first =  H. C. |date=1773 |pages=67–71 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=myMGAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA67}}</ref>

The [[human eye]] (and those of animals such as birds, fish, reptiles etc.) works much like a camera obscura with an opening ([[pupil]]), a convex [[lens (anatomy)|lens]], and a surface where the image is formed ([[retina]]). Some cameras obscuras use a concave mirror for a focusing effect similar to a convex lens.<ref name="amateur work"/>

==Technology==
[[File:Camera Obscura box18thCentury.jpg|thumb|A camera obscura box with mirror, with an upright projected image at the top]]

A camera obscura consists of a box, tent, or room with a small hole in one side or the top. Light from an external scene passes through the hole and strikes a surface inside, where the scene is reproduced, inverted (upside-down) and reversed (left to right), but with color and [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] preserved.<ref name="mass">{{cite book |author=Melvin Lawrence DeFleur, and Sandra Ball-Rokeach |title=Theories of Mass Communication |date=1989 |publisher=Longman |isbn=9780801300073 |page=65 |edition=5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ywe4AAAAIAAJ |access-date=11 January 2021}}</ref>

To produce a reasonably clear projected image, the aperture is typically smaller than 1/100th the distance to the screen.
As the pinhole is made smaller, the image gets sharper, but dimmer. With a too small pinhole, however, the sharpness worsens, due to [[diffraction]]. Optimum sharpness is attained with an aperture diameter approximately equal to the geometric mean of the wavelength of light and the distance to the screen.<ref name="physics">{{cite book |author=Heinrich F. Beyer and Viateheslav P. Shevelko |title=Introduction to the Physics of Highly Charged Ions |date=2016 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=9781420034097 |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5enLBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA42 |access-date=11 January 2021}}</ref>

In practice, camera obscuras use a [[Lens (optics)|lens]] rather than a pinhole because it allows a larger [[aperture]], giving a usable brightness while maintaining focus.<ref name="amateur work"/>

If the image is caught on a translucent screen, it can be viewed from the back so that it is no longer reversed (but still upside-down).  Using mirrors, it is possible to project a right-side-up image. The projection can also be displayed on a horizontal surface (e.g., a table). The 18th-century overhead version in tents used mirrors inside a kind of periscope on the top of the tent.<ref name="amateur work"/>

The box-type camera obscura often has an angled mirror projecting an upright image onto [[tracing paper]] placed on its glass top. Although the image is viewed from the back, it is reversed by the mirror.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Steadman |first1=Philip |title=Vermeer's Camera: Uncovering the Truth Behind the Masterpieces |date=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780192803023 |page=9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Xu6lJc2Nt8C |access-date=11 January 2021}}</ref>

==History==
===Prehistory to 500 BCE: Possible inspiration for prehistoric art and possible use in religious ceremonies, gnomons===
There are theories that occurrences of camera obscura effects (through tiny holes in tents or in screens of animal hide) inspired [[paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s. Distortions in the shapes of animals in many paleolithic cave artworks might be inspired by distortions seen when the surface on which an image was projected was not straight or not in the right angle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paleo-camera.com/paleolithic/ |title=Paleolithic |publisher=paleo-camera |access-date=2 May 2017}}</ref>
It is also suggested that camera obscura projections could have played a role in [[Neolithic]] structures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paleo-camera.com/neolithic/ |title=Neolithic |publisher=paleo-camera |access-date=2 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jennifer Ouellette |url=https://gizmodo.com/did-prehistoric-people-watch-the-stars-through-this-6-0-1782759791 |title=deadspin-quote-carrot-aligned-w-bgr-2 |website=Gizmodo |date=29 June 2016}}</ref>

One of the earliest known written records of a [[pinhole camera]] for camera obscura effect is found in the Chinese text called ''[[Mozi (book)|Mozi]]'', dated to the 4th century BCE, traditionally ascribed to and named for [[Mozi]] (circa 470 BCE-circa 391 BCE), a [[History of Science and Technology in China|Chinese]] philosopher and the founder of [[Mohism|Mohist School of Logic]].<ref name="needham4 98">{{cite book|last=Needham|first=Joseph|title=Science and Civilization in China, vol.

Light coming from the foot of an illuminated person were partly hidden below (i.e., strike below the pinhole) and partly formed the top of the image. Rays from the head were partly hidden above (i.e., strike above the pinhole) and partly formed the lower part of the image.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paleo-camera.com/ancient-greece/ |title=Ancient Greece |publisher=paleo-camera |date=9 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |date= 2004 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BIL2BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA15 |title= Ghost Images: Cinema of the Afterlife |last= Ruffles |first=Tom |pages= 15–17|isbn= 9780786420056 }}</ref>

Another early account is provided by [[List of ancient Greek philosophers|Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE), or possibly a follower of his ideas. Similar to the later 11th-century Arab scientist [[Alhazen]], Aristotle is also thought to have used camera obscura for observing [[solar eclipse]]s.<ref name="needham4 98"/> Camera obscura is touched upon as a subject in Aristotle's work ''[[Problems (Aristotle)|Problems]] – Book XV'', asking: {{quote|Why is it that when the sun passes through quadri-laterals, as for instance in wickerwork, it does not produce a figure rectangular in shape but circular?|sign=|source=}} and further on: {{quote|"Why is it that an eclipse of the sun, if one looks at it through a sieve or through leaves, such as a plane-tree or other broadleaved tree, or if one joins the fingers of one hand over the fingers of the other, the rays are crescent-shaped where they reach the earth? Is it for the same reason as that when light shines through a rectangular peep-hole, it appears circular in the form of a cone?"}}

Many philosophers and scientists of the Western world pondered this question before it was accepted that the circular and crescent-shapes described in the "problem" were pinhole image projections of the sun. Although a projected image has the shape of the aperture when the light source, aperture and projection plane are close together, the projected image has the shape of the light source when they are farther apart.

In his book ''[[Euclid's Optics|Optics]]'' (circa 300 BCE, surviving in later manuscripts from around 1000 CE), Euclid proposed mathematical descriptions of vision with "lines drawn directly from the eye pass through a space of great extent" and "the form of the space included in our vision is a cone, with its apex in the eye and its base at the limits of our vision."<ref>{{cite book|url=http://philomatica.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Optics-of-Euclid.pdf|title=Optics of Euclid}}</ref> Later versions of the text, like [[Ignazio Danti]]'s 1573 annotated translation, would add a description of the camera obscura principle to demonstrate Euclid's ideas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bonnerweb.de/bilder/pinhole/sonnentaler/sonnentaler.htm|language=de|title=Kleine Geschichte der Lochkamera oder Camera Obscura}}</ref>

[[Arab]] [[physicist]] [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (known in the West by the Latinised Alhazen) (965–1040) extensively studied the camera obscura phenomenon in the early 11th century.

In his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (circa 1027), Ibn al-Haytham explained that rays of light travel in straight lines and are distinguished by the body that reflected the rays, writing:<ref>A.

Ibn al-Haytham also analyzed the rays of sunlight and concluded that they made a conic shape where they met at the hole, forming another conic shape reverse to the first one from the hole to the opposite wall in the dark room.

In his 1088 book, ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'', the [[Song Dynasty]] Chinese scientist [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095) compared the focal point of a concave burning-mirror and the "collecting" hole of camera obscura phenomena to an oar in a rowlock to explain how the images were inverted:<ref>{{cite book|last=Needham|first=Joseph|title=Science and Civilization in China, vol.

{{quote|"When a bird flies in the air, its shadow moves along the ground in the same direction. But if its image is collected (''shu'')(like a belt being tightened) through a small hole in a window, then the shadow moves in the direction opposite of that of the bird.[...] This is the same principle as the burning-mirror. Such a mirror has a concave surface, and reflects a finger to give an upright image if the object is very near, but if the finger moves farther and farther away it reaches a point where the image disappears and after that the image appears inverted. Thus the point where the image disappears is like the pinhole of the window. So also the oar is fixed at the rowlock somewhere at its middle part, constituting, when it is moved, a sort of 'waist' and the handle of the oar is always in the position inverse to the end (which is in the water)."}}

Shen Kuo also responded to a statement of [[Duan Chengshi]] in ''[[Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang]]'' written in about 840 that the inverted image of a [[Chinese pagoda]] tower beside a seashore, was inverted because it was reflected by the sea: "This is nonsense.

English philosopher and Franciscan friar [[Roger Bacon]] (c. 1219/20 – c. 1292) falsely stated in his ''De Multiplicatione Specerium'' (1267) that an image projected through a square aperture was round because light would travel in spherical waves and therefore assumed its natural shape after passing through a hole.

[[Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī]] (1267–1319) described in his 1309 work ''Kitab Tanqih al-Manazir'' (''The Revision of the Optics'') how he experimented with a glass sphere filled with water in a camera obscura with a controlled aperture and found that the colors of the rainbow are phenomena of the decomposition of light.<ref>Nader El-Bizri, "Optics", in ''Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia'', ed.

French Jewish philosopher, mathematician, physicist and astronomer/astrologer [[Gersonides|Levi ben Gershon]] (1288–1344) (also known as Gersonides or Leo de Balneolis) made several astronomical observations using a camera obscura with a [[Jacob's staff]], describing methods to measure the angular diameters of the sun, the moon and the bright planets Venus and Jupiter. He determined the eccentricity of the sun based on his observations of the summer and winter solstices in 1334. Levi also noted how the size of the aperture determined the size of the projected image. He wrote about his findings in Hebrew in his treatise ''Sefer Milhamot Ha-Shem'' (''The Wars of the Lord'') Book V Chapters 5 and 9.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Astronomy of Levi ben Gerson|pages=140–143|last=Goldstein|first=Bernard R.|date=6 December 2012|isbn=9789401133425|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ETOtBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA79}}</ref>

{{quote|If the facade of a building, or a place, or a landscape is illuminated by the sun and a small hole is drilled in the wall of a room in a building facing this, which is not directly lighted by the sun, then all objects illuminated by the sun will send their images through this aperture and will appear, upside down, on the wall facing the hole.
You will catch these pictures on a piece of white paper, which placed vertically in the room not far from that opening, and you will see all the above-mentioned objects on this paper in their natural shapes or colors, but they will appear smaller and upside down, on account of crossing of the rays at that aperture. If these pictures originate from a place which is illuminated by the sun, they will appear colored on the paper exactly as they are.

Da Vinci was clearly very interested in the camera obscura: over the years he drew circa 270 diagrams of the camera obscura in his notebooks . He systematically experimented with various shapes and sizes of apertures and with multiple apertures (1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 16, 24, 28 and 32). He compared the working of the eye to that of the camera obscura and seemed especially interested in its capability of demonstrating basic principles of optics: the inversion of images through the pinhole or pupil, the non-interference of images and the fact that images are "all in all and all in every part".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sumscorp.com/leonardo_studies/news_98.html |title=Leonardo and the Camera Obscura / Kim Veltman |publisher=Sumscorp.com |date=2 December 1986 |access-date=2 May 2017}}</ref>

The oldest known published drawing of a camera obscura is found in Dutch physician, mathematician and instrument maker [[Gemma Frisius]]’ 1545 book ''De Radio Astronomica et Geometrica'', in which he described and illustrated how he used the camera obscura to study the solar eclipse of 24 January 1544<ref name=Repstad/>

Italian polymath [[Gerolamo Cardano]] described using a glass disc – probably a [[biconvex lens]] – in a camera obscura in his 1550 book ''De subtilitate, vol. I, Libri IV''. He suggested to use it to view "what takes place in the street when the sun shines" and advised to use a very white sheet of paper as a projection screen so the colours wouldn't be dull.<ref name=Ilardi />

Sicilian mathematician and astronomer [[Francesco Maurolico]] (1494–1575) answered Aristotle's problem how sunlight that shines through rectangular holes can form round spots of light or crescent-shaped spots during an eclipse in his treatise ''Photismi de lumine et umbra'' (1521–1554). However this wasn't published before 1611,<ref>{{cite book|title=Photismi de lumine et umbra|year=1611|last=Maurolico|first=Francesco|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ug6ywn-D9BgC&pg=PP9}}</ref> after Johannes Kepler had published similar findings of his own.

Italian polymath [[Giambattista della Porta]] described the camera obscura, which he called "obscurum cubiculum", in the 1558 first edition of his book series ''[[Magia Naturalis]]''. He suggested to use a convex lens to project the image onto paper and to use this as a drawing aid. Della Porta compared the human eye to the camera obscura: "For the image is let into the eye through the eyeball just as here through the window". The popularity of Della Porta's books helped spread knowledge of the camera obscura.<ref name=Larsen>{{cite web|url=http://www.williamshakespeare-sonnets.com/sonnet-24|last=Larsen|first=Kenneth|title=Sonnet 24|access-date=2 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160707173823/http://www.williamshakespeare-sonnets.com/sonnet-24|archive-date=7 July 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Durbin|first=P.T.|year=2012|title=Philosophy of Technology|page=74|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R2OSBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA74|isbn=9789400923034}}</ref>

Around 1575 Italian Dominican priest, mathematician, astronomer, and cosmographer [[Ignazio Danti]] designed a camera obscura gnomon and a meridian line for the [[Basilica of Santa Maria Novella]], Florence and he later had a massive gnomon built in the [[San Petronio Basilica]] in Bologna. The gnomon was used to study the movements of the sun during the year and helped in determining the new Gregorian calendar for which Danti took place in the commission appointed by [[Pope Gregory XIII|Pope Gregorius XIII]] and instituted in 1582.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cassini|title=1655–2005: 350 Years of the Great Meridian Line|url=http://stelle.bo.astro.it/archivio/2005-anno-cassiniano/meridian_ing.htm}}</ref>

This leaves the image reversed, but would become common practice in later camera obscura boxes.<ref name=Ilardi />

Giambattista della Porta added a "lenticular crystal" or biconvex lens to the camera obscura description in the 1589 second edition of ''Magia Naturalis''. He also described use of the camera obscura to project hunting scenes, banquets, battles, plays, or anything desired on white sheets. Trees, forests, rivers, mountains "that are really so, or made by Art, of Wood, or some other matter" could be arranged on a plain in the sunshine on the other side of the camera obscura wall. Little children and animals (for instance handmade deer, wild boars, rhinos, elephants, and lions) could perform in this set. "Then, by degrees, they must appear, as coming out of their dens, upon the Plain: The Hunter he must come with his hunting Pole, Nets, Arrows, and other necessaries, that may represent hunting: Let there be Horns, Cornets, Trumpets sounded: those that are in the Chamber shall see Trees, Animals, Hunters Faces, and all the rest so plainly, that they cannot tell whether they be true or delusions: Swords drawn will glister in at the hole, that they will make people almost afraid." 
Della Porta claimed to have shown such spectacles often to his friends. They admired it very much and could hardly be convinced by Della Porta's explanations that what they had seen was really an optical trick.<ref name=Larsen /><ref>{{cite book|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A55484.0001.001/1:20?rgn=div1;view=fulltext |title=Natural Magick (Book XVII, Chap.

In 1611, Frisian/German astronomers [[David Fabricius|David]] and [[Johannes Fabricius]] (father and son) studied sunspots with a camera obscura, after realizing looking at the sun directly with the telescope could damage their eyes.<ref name =aps/> They are thought to have combined the telescope and the camera obscura into camera obscura telescopy.<ref name=aps/><ref>Surdin, V., and M.

In 1612, Italian mathematician [[Benedetto Castelli]] wrote to his mentor, the Italian astronomer, physicist, engineer, philosopher, and mathematician [[Galileo Galilei]] about projecting images of the sun through a [[telescope]] (invented in 1608) to study the recently discovered sunspots. Galilei wrote about Castelli's technique to the German Jesuit priest, physicist, and astronomer Christoph Scheiner.<ref name=Whitehouse/>

It consisted of a ball as big as a fist, through which a hole (AB) was made with a lens attached on one side (B). This ball was placed inside two-halves of part of a hollow ball that were then glued together (CD), in which it could be turned around.

Italian Jesuit philosopher, mathematician, and astronomer [[Mario Bettinus|Mario Bettini]] wrote about making a camera obscura with twelve holes in his ''Apiaria universae philosophiae mathematicae'' (1642). When a foot soldier would stand in front of the camera, a twelve-person army of soldiers making the same movements would be projected.

French mathematician, [[Minim (religious order)|Minim friar]], and painter of [[Anamorphosis|anamorphic art]] [[Jean François Niceron|Jean-François Nicéron]] (1613–1646) wrote about the camera obscura with convex lenses. He explained how the camera obscura could be used by painters to achieve perfect perspective in their work. He also complained how charlatans abused the camera obscura to fool witless spectators and make them believe that the projections were magic or occult science. These writings were published in a posthumous version of ''La Perspective Curieuse'' (1652).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_7xMOAAAAQAAJ|title=La Perspective curieuse|publisher=Chez la veufue F.

===1650 to 1800: Introduction of the magic lantern, popular portable box-type drawing aid, painting aid===
The use of the camera obscura to project special shows to entertain an audience seems to have remained very rare. A description of what was most likely such a show in 1656 in France, was penned by the poet [[Jean Loret]]. The Parisian society were presented with upside-down images of palaces, ballet dancing and battling with swords. The performance was silent and Loret was surprised that all the movements made no sound. Loret felt somewhat frustrated that he did not know the secret that made this spectacle possible. There are several clues that this was a camera obscura show, rather than a very early [[magic lantern]] show, especially in the upside-down image and the energetic movements.<ref>http://www.magiclantern.org.uk/new-magic-lantern-journal/pdfs/4008787a.pdf</ref>

German Jesuit scientist [[Gaspar Schott]] heard from a traveler about a small camera obscura device he had seen in Spain, which one could carry under one arm and could be hidden under a coat. He then constructed his own sliding box camera obscura, which could focus by sliding a wooden box part fitted inside another wooden box part. He wrote about this in his 1657 ''Magia universalis naturæ et artis'' (volume 1 – book 4 "Magia Optica" pages 199–201).

By 1659 the [[magic lantern]] was introduced and partly replaced the camera obscura as a projection device, while the camera obscura mostly remained popular as a drawing aid. The magic lantern can be seen as a development of the (box-type) camera obscura device.

The 17th century [[Dutch Masters]], such as [[Johannes Vermeer]], were known for their magnificent attention to detail. It has been widely speculated that they made use of the camera obscura,<ref name=":0" /> but the extent of their use by artists at this period remains a matter of fierce contention, recently revived by the [[Hockney–Falco thesis]].<ref name=Snyder/>

[[File:1676 Johann Sturm - Camerae Obscurae Portatilis.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a portable camera obscura device from [[Johann Sturm]], ''[[Collegium Experimentale]]'' (1676)]]
German philosopher [[Johann Sturm]] published an illustrated article about the construction of a portable camera obscura box with a 45° mirror and an oiled paper screen in the first volume of the proceedings of the [[Collegium Curiosum]], ''Collegium Experimentale, sive Curiosum'' (1676).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbMWAAAAQAAJ|title=Collegium experimentale, sive curiosum |first=Johann |last=Sturm |year=1676 |language=la |pages=161–163}}</ref>

[[Johann Zahn]]'s ''Oculus Artificialis Teledioptricus Sive Telescopium'', published in 1685, contains many descriptions, diagrams, illustrations and sketches of both the camera obscura and the [[magic lantern]]. A hand-held device with a mirror-reflex mechanism was first proposed by [[Johann Zahn]] in 1685, a design that would later be used in photographic cameras.<ref>Gernsheim, pp. 5–6</ref>

The scientist Robert Hooke presented a paper in 1694 to the Royal Society, in which he described a portable camera obscura. It was a cone-shaped box which fit onto the head and shoulders of its user.<ref>Wenczel, pg. 15</ref>

From the beginning of the 18th century, craftsmen and opticians would make camera obscura devices in the shape of books, which were much appreciated by lovers of optical devices.<ref name=Mannoni1 />

One chapter in the Conte [[Francesco Algarotti|Algarotti's]] ''Saggio sopra Pittura'' (1764) is dedicated to the use of a camera ottica ("optic chamber") in painting.<ref>{{cite book | first= Francesco| last= Algarotti | year=1764 | title= ''Saggio sopra la pittura'' | editor= Presso Marco Coltellini, Livorno| pages= 59–63 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SNY9AAAAcAAJ }}</ref>

By the 18th century, following developments by [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Robert Hooke]], more easily portable models in boxes became available. These were extensively used by amateur artists while on their travels, but they were also employed by professionals, including [[Paul Sandby]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]], whose camera (disguised as a book) is now in the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum in London]]. Such cameras were later adapted by [[Joseph Nicephore Niepce]], [[Louis Daguerre]] and [[William Fox Talbot]] for creating the first photographs.

While the technical principles of the camera obscura have been known since antiquity, the broad use of the technical concept in producing images with a [[linear perspective]] in paintings, maps, theatre setups, and architectural, and, later, photographic images and movies started in the Western Renaissance and the scientific revolution. While, e.g., [[Alhazen]] (Ibn al-Haytham) had already observed an optical effect and developed a state of the art theory of the refraction of light, he was less interested to produce images with it (compare [[Hans Belting]] 2005); the society he lived in was even hostile (compare [[Aniconism in Islam]]) toward personal images.<ref name="belt">Hans Belting Das echte Bild.

In 1827, critic Vergnaud complained about the use of camera obscura for many painting at that year's Salon exhibition in Paris: "Is the public to blame, the artists, or the jury, when history paintings, already rare, are sacrificed to genre painting, and what genre at that!... that of the camera obscura."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pinson|first=Stephen|date=2003-07-01|title=Daguerre, expérimentateur du visuel|url=http://journals.openedition.org/etudesphotographiques/345|journal=Études photographiques|language=fr|issue=13|pages=110–135|issn=1270-9050}}</ref> (translated from French)
