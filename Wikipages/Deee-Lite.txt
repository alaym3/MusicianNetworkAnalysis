'''Deee-Lite''' was an American [[House music|house]] and [[Dance music|dance]] music group formed in [[New York City]]. The group's best-known [[Single (music)|single]] is "[[Groove Is in the Heart]]", which was released in 1990 from their debut studio [[album]] ''[[World Clique]]'' (1990), and was a top-ten hit in multiple countries. In December 2016, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' ranked them as the 55th most successful dance artists of all time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/greatest-top-dance-club-artists|title=Greatest of All Time Top Dance Club Artists : Page 1|website=Billboard.com|access-date=2019-12-04}}</ref>

==Background and career history==
The band began in 1986 as a duo in [[New York City]] with [[Lady Miss Kier]] (born Kierin Magenta Kirby) primarily on vocals and Supa DJ Dmitry (born in [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]] as Dmitry Brill) as the DJ, but became a trio when Jungle DJ [[Towa Tei]] (Japanese-born Dong-hwa Chung) joined the group in 1988.

Initially, Kier and Dmitry performed their songs monthly in numerous downtown NYC nightclubs from 1986 onwards.<ref>{{Citation|last=5ninthavenueproject|title=Deee-lite performs at Larry Tee's Celebrity Club|date=2008-12-19|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gUZ7FAJzIs|access-date=2018-10-13}}</ref> In 1987, Kier bought the [[Akai]] sampler, which influenced their sound tremendously, hence the name of their production company: "Sampladelic".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mixcloud.com/ladykier/stream/|title=lady miss kier|website=Mixcloud.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-13}}</ref> From the band's inception, Kier designed the posters and club invites and was also the graphic designer for all three albums and 12" singles.<ref name="Hotspots!

Magazine|date=2012-08-23|work=Hotspots! Magazine|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en-US}}</ref> The band played in both hip-hop and house clubs,<ref name="Gudjonsson">{{Cite web|url=http://internet.is/bret/world-clique-tour.htm|title=Garden Of Deee-Lite|last=Gudjonsson|first=E.|website=Internet.is|access-date=2018-10-13}}</ref> and both gay and straight clubs, including Wigstock<ref>{{Cite web|website=Vimeo.com|title=Deee-Lite Wigstock 1990|date=2015-08-13|url=https://vimeo.com/136260000|access-date=2018-10-13}}</ref> and opening for Native Tongue Movement's [[De La Soul]] and [[Jungle Brothers]]. As described in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', "they were drawing vivid, multiracial, pan-sexual crowds...". Part of the band's appeal was its inclusiveness, as noted by [[Mademoiselle (magazine)|''Mademoiselle'']] magazine "as a group, they're a festival of individuality; as a band, they're a party anyone can attend".<ref name="Gudjonsson"/> In these early years, their live shows garnered a steady following and attracted Towa Tei as a fan.

Thereafter, Towa sent Kier and Dmitry a bedroom DJ tape he had made and they realised he, like them, also enjoyed a fusion of funk and techno. Towa and Dmitry began jointly programming the band's computer. Although Towa did not play any instruments, he was an avid record collector and added a slickness to their process by adding in samples. They invited him to join the group in 1988 and together the three produced their first album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.blairmag.com/blair1/towa/towabio.html|title=Towa Tei's Biography|website=Blairmag.com|access-date=2018-10-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121013057/http://www.blairmag.com/blair1/towa/towabio.html|archive-date=2008-11-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> Kier wrote all the lyrics and melodies, and also coordinated reaching out to [[Bootsy Collins]] to get him involved in sessions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/classic-album-lady-miss-kier-on-deee-lites-world-clique-642648|title=Classic album: Lady Miss Kier on Deee-Lite's World Clique|work=MusicRadar|access-date=2018-10-13|language=EN-GB}}</ref> Dmitry played guitar, keyboard, and bass, and Towa gathered samples for fill-ins and grooves.<ref name="Albumism">{{Cite news|url=https://www.albumism.com/celebrations/happy-birthday-lady-miss-kier|title=Happy Birthday to Lady Miss Kier, Born August 15, 1963|work=Albumism|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en-US}}</ref> Bootsy Collins introduced them to [[The Horny Horns]], [[Fred Wesley]], [[Maceo Parker]], Mudbone Cooper, and [[Bernie Worrell]].

==Album releases and fame==
In 1990, their first album, ''[[World Clique]]'', shot to the top of the dance charts, and the song "[[Groove Is in the Heart]]" became their first number-one hit. The song features vocals from [[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]] of [[A Tribe Called Quest]] as well as the famous [[bass guitar]] loop, sampled from the [[Herbie Hancock]] song "Bring Down The Birds" and additional vocals by [[Funk music|funk]] musician [[Bootsy Collins]], a fan of the group. A politically-charged second album was released following their success, entitled ''[[Infinity Within]]'' in 1992. The album failed to chart as high as their debut, but they still scored two Top 40 dance hits with "Runaway" and "Pussycat Meow".

Deee-Lite's music has been featured on soundtracks for many television shows and movies, including ''[[Party Girl (1995 film)|Party Girl]]'', ''[[Britain's Got More Talent]]'', ''[[The Voice (Australian season 4)|The Voice]]'', ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race]]'', ''[[American Crime Story]]'', ''[[Coronation Street]]'', ''[[Transparent (TV series)|Transparent]]'', ''[[Misfits (TV series)|Misfits]]'', ''[[Hello Ladies]]'', ''[[The Heat (film)|The Heat]]'', ''[[New Girl]]'', ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', ''[[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia]]'', ''[[Private Practice (TV series)|Private Practice]]'', ''[[I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry]]'', ''[[License to Wed]]'', ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'', ''[[What Love Is]]'', ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]'', ''[[Down to You]]'', ''[[Lost & Found]]'', ''[[Can't Hardly Wait]]'', ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]'', ''[[The Heat (film)|The Heat]]'', ''[[Bill Nye the Science Guy]]'', ''[[Kill the Mob]]'', ''[[The War Room]]'', and ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]''.

In 2018, the Netflix series [[Big Mouth (TV series)|''Big Mouth'']] released a [[Planned Parenthood]]- and Deee-Lite-themed episode<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://tv.avclub.com/nick-kroll-on-how-a-talk-by-planned-parenthood-led-to-b-1829562016|title=Nick Kroll on how a talk by Planned Parenthood led to Big Mouth's boldest episode yet|last=Adams|first=Erik|work=TV Club|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en-US}}</ref>—it is noteworthy Kier has been a longtime abortion rights advocate.<ref>{{Cite web |publisher=[[YouTube]] |title=pro-choice public service {{sic|announc|ment|nolink=y}} |date=2006-04-08 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrEPCgaT-Sc|access-date=2018-10-13}}</ref>

== Disbandment and aftermath ==
Towa ultimately did not join the other two on their world tours, for which they had a nine-piece band, as he preferred to start working on the second Deee-Lite album (''Infinity Within''), from the comfort of his own home where his records and samples were located.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-xpm-1994-09-11-9409110226-story.html%5D|title=DEEE-LITE'S LATE IN COMING, BUT LICKETY-QUICK TO PLEASE|last=Writer|first=Greg Morago|website=Courant.com|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en-US}}</ref> As told to MTV News, "...a reason I left Deee-Lite was that I hated the touring—playing the same songs over and over again every night," Towa said. "I'm not that type of person. I don't like being in front of the people".<ref name="MTV News">{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/151885/towa-teis-music-on-display-in-sound-museum/|title=Towa Tei's Music On Display In Sound Museum|work=MTV News|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en}}</ref> After extensive touring, Kier and Dmitry were not given tour funding for the second album, ''Infinity Within'', as promised by the Warner contract.<ref name="Albumism" /> After the release of their second album, Kier and Dmitry wondered if their sound was losing touch with the dancefloor and began writing the dancefloor classic album ''[[Dewdrops in the Garden]]''.<ref name="MTV News"/> At the time, the creative differences were strong between Towa and the other two members of Deee-Lite. As told to MTV News by Towa, "When I made a big decision to take a break," Towa said, "I started to listen to different types of music again—bossa nova, soundtracks. I started getting materials that went beyond the Deee-Lite concept. For me it fit, but for them it didn't really fit".<ref name="MTV News"/> Prior to the release of the group's third album, ''Dewdrops in the Garden'', Towa abruptly left the band (appearing only on the track "Call Me") and was replaced by DJ Ani. Kier was determined to keep the band together and offered Towa to remix a song of his choice so he'd have a presence on the third Deee-Lite album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Deee-Lite-Dewdrops-In-The-Garden/release/1829877|title=Deee-Lite - Dewdrops In The Garden|website=Discogs.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}</ref> Even with a roster change and minimal [[record label]] support, Deee-Lite still managed to tour for one year after the release of the album, even selling more copies than their second release. In 1994, Kier and Dmitry's turbulent relationship came to an end and so did the group.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.gosocial.co/remember-deee-lites-groove-heart-heres-looks-like-now-copy/|title=Remember Deee-Lite's 'Groove Is In The Heart'? Here's What She Looks Like Now|website=Gosocial.co|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en-US}}</ref>

In total, the group scored six number-one [[hit record|hits]] on the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Club Play]] [[record chart|chart]] over the five years they were together. In the years after the band's break-up, financial problems due to bad management<ref name="Hotspots! Magazine"/> impacted both Kier and Dmitry—however, they survived and are still in business as writers, producers and DJs. Kier is still primarily a singer, songwriter, and DJ, having traveled all over the world and performed on numerous albums with internationally acclaimed artists. She is often regarded as a style "icon" by publications such as ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://leblow.co.uk/60s-fashion-in-the-90s-deee-lite/lady-miss-kier-vogue-italia-1990/|title=Lady Miss Kier Vogue Italia 1990 - Le Blow UK Fashion and Lifestyle Blog|date=2013-10-27|website=Leblow.co.uk|access-date=2014-08-04}}</ref> for her distinctive style of dress and continual influence on the international fashion scene. Dmitry continued working as a DJ, from [[Hong Kong]] to [[Jerusalem]], and from [[Berlin]]'s [[Love Parade]] to [[Brazil]]'s [[Rock In Rio]]. He was given a DJ of the year award in [[Ibiza]], and has remixed for many artists including [[Arthur Russell (musician)|Arthur Russell]], [[Jungle Brothers]], [[Sinead O'Connor]], [[Ziggy Marley]], [[Nina Hagen]], [[Ultra Naté]], and others. He collaborated with [[Julee Cruise]] (of ''[[Twin Peaks]]''/[[David Lynch]] fame) to release the album ''[[My Secret Life (Julee Cruise album)|My Secret Life]]''. Dmitry is currently based in Berlin where he continues to DJ, compose, produce, and re-mix. Towa Tei has recorded several albums as a solo artist, and is currently featured in Japanese supergroup [[METAFIVE]]. In a 2011 interview, Towa Tei dismissed the chances of Deee-Lite reforming, citing the creative and personal differences that prompted him to depart.<ref name="tei">{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.jp/en/tokyo/feature/3330/Towa-Tei-the-interview |title=Towa Tei: The Interview |access-date=8 July 2011 |last=Hadfield |first=James |date=May 18, 2011 |work=Time Out Tokyo |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804101427/http://www.timeout.jp/en/tokyo/feature/3330/Towa-Tei-the-interview |archive-date=4 August 2011 }}</ref>
