'''Grand Funk Railroad''', sometimes shortened as '''Grand Funk''', is an American rock band who achieved their peak in popularity during the 1970s.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book |title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] |editor-first=Colin |editor-last=Larkin |editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer) |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |date=1997 |edition=Concise |isbn=1-85227-745-9 |page=539}}</ref> Known for their crowd-pleasing [[arena rock]] style, the band toured extensively and played to packed arenas worldwide, and was well-regarded by audiences despite a relative lack of critical acclaim.<ref name="Rock's Backpages Library">{{cite web |url=http://www.rocksbackpages.com/artist.html?ArtistID=grandfunkrailroad |title=Grand Funk Railroad interviews, articles and reviews from Rock's Backpages |publisher=Rocksbackpages.com |date=April 26, 1996 |access-date=July 22, 2011}}</ref> The band's name is a [[Pun|play on words]] of the [[Grand Trunk Western Railroad]], a line that runs through the band's home town of [[Flint, Michigan]].

== History ==
[[File:Grand Funk Railroad Bridge, Flint, Michigan.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Grand Trunk Western Railroad]] bridge (located at 42°59'56.2"N 83°41'35.6"W) in Grand Funk's hometown of [[Flint, Michigan]], that was re-painted to instead show the band's name, as well as the first names of founding members [[Mark Farner]] and [[Don Brewer]], and early 1980s bassist Dennis Bellinger]]

=== Formation (1969) ===
Grand Funk Railroad was formed as a trio in 1969 by [[Mark Farner]] (guitar, keyboards, harmonica, vocals) and [[Don Brewer]] (drums, vocals) from [[Terry Knight and the Pack]], and [[Mel Schacher]] (bass) from [[Question Mark & the Mysterians]].<ref name="Larkin" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.markfarner.com/timeline.php |title=Mark Farner: Timeline|work=markfarner.com |accessdate=October 4, 2021 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202091758/http://www.markfarner.com/timeline.php |archivedate=February 2, 2015}}</ref> Knight soon became the band's manager and also named the band as a play on words for the Grand Trunk Western Railroad, a well-known rail line in Michigan.<ref name="Larkin" /> First achieving recognition at the 1969 [[Atlanta International Pop Festival (1969)|Atlanta International Pop Festival]], the band was signed by [[Capitol Records]]. After a raucous, well-received set on the first day of the festival, Grand Funk was asked back to play at the 1970 [[Atlanta International Pop Festival (1970)|Atlanta International Pop Festival II]] the following year. Patterned after hard-rock power trios such as [[Cream (band)|Cream]], the band, with Terry Knight's marketing savvy, developed its own popular style. In August 1969 the band released its first album titled ''[[On Time]]'', which sold over one million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold record]] in 1970.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Murrells |year=1978 |title=The Book of Golden Discs |edition=2nd |publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/279 279] |isbn=0-214-20512-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/279 }}</ref>

In February 1970 a second album, ''[[Grand Funk (album)|Grand Funk]]'' (or ''The Red Album''), was awarded gold status.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs" /> Despite critical pans and little [[airplay]], the group's first six albums (five studio releases and one live album) were quite successful.

=== Early 1970s ===
The hit single "[[I'm Your Captain (Closer to Home)]]", from the album ''[[Closer to Home]]'', released in June 1970, was considered stylistically representative of Terry Knight and the Pack's recordings. In the spring of 1970, Knight launched an intensive advertising campaign to promote the album ''Closer to Home''.<ref name="Larkin" /> That album was certified multiplatinum despite a lack of critical approval.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs" /> The band spent $100,000 on a New York City [[Times Square]] [[billboard]] to advertise ''Closer to Home''.<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book |first=John |last=Tobler |year=1992 |title=NME Rock 'N' Roll Years |edition=1st |publisher=Reed International Books Ltd |location=London |page=213 |id=CN 5585}}</ref>

By 1971, Grand Funk equalled [[the Beatles]]' [[Shea Stadium]] attendance record, but sold out the venue in just 72 hours whereas the Beatles concert took a few weeks to sell out.<ref name="james15-16,22,37,60">James (1999), pp. 15–16, 22, 37, 60.</ref> Following ''Closer to Home'', The double disc ''[[Live Album (Grand Funk Railroad album)|Live Album]]'' was also released later in 1970, and was another gold disc recipient.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs" /> ''[[Survival (Grand Funk Railroad album)|Survival]]'' and ''[[E Pluribus Funk]]'' were both released in 1971. ''E Pluribus Funk'' celebrated the Shea Stadium show with an embossed depiction of the stadium on the album cover's reverse.

By late 1971, the band was concerned with Knight's managerial style and fiscal responsibility. This growing dissatisfaction led Grand Funk Railroad to fire Knight in early 1972. Knight sued for breach of contract, which resulted in a protracted legal battle. At one point, Knight repossessed the band's gear before a gig at [[Madison Square Garden]]. In [[VH1]]'s ''[[Behind the Music]]'' Grand Funk Railroad episode, Knight stated that the original contract would have run out in about three months, and that the smart decision for the band would have been to just wait out the time.<ref name="james31,36–37,76">James (1999), pp. 31, 36–37, 76.</ref> However, at that moment, the band members felt they had no choice but to continue and fight for the rights to their careers and name. The legal battle with Knight lasted two years and ended when the band settled out of court. Knight came out the clear winner with the copyrights and publisher's royalties to every Grand Funk recording made from March 1969 through March 1972, not to mention a large payoff in cash and oil wells. Farner, Brewer and Schacher were given the rights to the name Grand Funk Railroad.<ref name="auto">''Discoveries Magazine'' No. 124 October 1998 Steve Bond</ref>

In 1972 Grand Funk Railroad added [[Craig Frost]] on keyboards full-time. Originally, the band had attempted to attract [[Peter Frampton]], late of [[Humble Pie (band)|Humble Pie]]; however, he was not available due to signing a solo record deal with [[A&M Records]]. The addition of Frost, however, was a stylistic shift from Grand Funk's original garage-band based rock and roll roots to a more rhythm and blues/pop rock-oriented style.  With the new lineup, Grand Funk released ''[[Phoenix (Grand Funk Railroad album)|Phoenix]]'', its sixth album of original music, in September 1972.<ref name="james80,83–84">James (1999), pp. 80, 83–84.</ref>

To refine Grand Funk's sound, the band then secured veteran musician [[Todd Rundgren]] as a producer. Its two most successful albums and two number-one hit singles resulted: the Don Brewer-penned "[[We're an American Band (song)|We're an American Band]]" (from the number two album ''[[We're an American Band]]'', released in July 1973) and "[[The Loco-Motion]]" (from their 1974 number five album ''[[Shinin' On]]'', written by [[Carole King]] and [[Gerry Goffin]] and originally recorded by [[Little Eva]]).<ref name="Larkin" /> "We're an American Band" became Grand Funk's first number-one hit on Farner's 25th birthday, followed by Brewer's number-19 hit "[[Walk Like a Man (Grand Funk Railroad song)|Walk Like a Man]]". "The Loco-Motion" in 1974 was Grand Funk's second chart-topping single, followed by Brewer's number-11 hit "Shinin' On". The band continued touring the U.S., Europe and Japan.<ref name="james90,92–94,104–106">James (1999), pp. 90, 92–94, 104–106.</ref>

=== Mid-1970s ===
In 1974 Grand Funk engaged [[Jimmy Ienner]] as producer and reverted to using their full name:  Grand Funk Railroad.  The cover of ''[[All the Girls in the World Beware!!!]]'' (December 1974) depicted the band members' heads superimposed on the bodies of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and [[Franco Columbu]]. This album spawned the band's last two top-10 hits, "[[Some Kind of Wonderful (Soul Brothers Six song)|Some Kind of Wonderful]]" and "[[Bad Time]]" in late 1974/early 1975.

Although they were highly successful in the mid-1970s, tensions mounted within the band due to personal issues, burn-out and disputes over musical direction. Despite these issues, Grand Funk forged ahead. Needing two more albums to complete their record deal with Capitol, Grand Funk embarked on a major tour and decided to record a double live album, ''[[Caught in the Act (Grand Funk Railroad album)|Caught in the Act]]'' (August 1975).<ref name="auto" />

The double album should have fulfilled the contract with Capitol; however, because it contained previously released material, Capitol requested an additional album to complete Grand Funk's contractual obligation. While pressures between the band members still existed, the members agreed to move forward and complete one more album for Capitol to avoid legalities similar to the ones that they endured with Terry Knight in 1972. The band recorded ''[[Born to Die (Grand Funk Railroad album)|Born to Die]]'' (January 1976), but its lower sales (it only managed to reach #47 on the Billboard chart) and lack of hit singles disappointed the group. They began to drift apart and a breakup was rumored.<ref name="james113–116,123–127">James (1999), pp. 113–116, 123–127.</ref>

However, Grand Funk found new life from interest by [[Frank Zappa]] in producing the band. Signing with [[MCA Records]], the resulting album ''[[Good Singin', Good Playin']]'' (August 1976), though it netted them some of their best critical reviews ever, yielded little success.<ref name="Larkin" /> After this, a totally disillusioned Grand Funk Railroad decided to disband in earnest in late 1976.<ref name="james130-134">James (1999), pp. 130–134.</ref> Farner recalled what happened at that time: "Things were disenfranchised within the band. I don't want to speculate about what was going on in Brewer's life—his first wife died, and that was rough—but one day he walked into the studio and said, 'I've had it. I need to find something to do with my life that's more stable.' He was done. He walked out and slammed the door. It was him, not me. Everybody thinks I broke the band up, but it was him."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.musicaficionado.com/|title=Music Aficionado|website=Web.musicaficionado.com|access-date=October 5, 2020}}</ref>

=== Disbanded, 1976–1981; new lineup in the early 1980s ===
Following the breakup, Farner began a solo career and signed with [[Atlantic Records]], which resulted in two albums: ''Mark Farner'' (1977) and ''No Frills'' (1978). Brewer, Schacher and Frost remained intact and formed the band Flint. Flint released one 1978 album on [[Columbia Records]]; a second record was finished but never released.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

After being approached in 1980 by their former manager Andy Caviliere (who had taken over from Terry Knight in 1972), Grand Funk Railroad reunited in February 1981 without Frost (who was playing with [[Bob Seger]]) and with [[Dennis Bellinger]] replacing Schacher on bass. Schacher begged off saying he had developed a fear of flying but later confided that he had no longer wanted to be involved with Caviliere.<ref name="auto" />

The new line-up released two albums on [[Irving Azoff]]'s [[Full Moon Records|Full Moon]] label, distributed by [[Warner Bros. Records]]. These releases included ''[[Grand Funk Lives]]'' (July 1981) and ''[[What's Funk?]]'' (January 1983).<ref name="Larkin" /> Neither album achieved much in the way of critical acclaim or sales; but the single "Queen Bee" was included in the film ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'' and its soundtrack album.<ref name="auto" />

The band toured in 1981 and 1982 with Rick Baker joining them on the road to play keyboards. But the dismal sales of ''Grand Funk Lives'' and the death of manager Caviliere in 1982 caused the group to disband a second time in early 1983, shortly after ''What's Funk?'' was released.<ref name="auto" />

Farner continued as a solo performer and became a [[Contemporary Christian Music|Christian recording artist]] while Brewer went on to join Frost in [[Bob Seger]]'s [[Silver Bullet Band]].<ref name="james139–149">James (1999), pp. 139–149.</ref> Farner was promoted by [[David Fishof]] in the late 1980s and was a part of Fishof's concept [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]] in 1995. After that, Fishof began sounding out Farner, Brewer and Schacher about reuniting again.<ref name="auto" />

=== Disbanded, 1983–1996; re-formation, 1996–present ===
After some rehearsals in late 1995, Grand Funk Railroad's three original members (joined on tour by keyboardist/guitarist and background vocalist Howard Eddy Jr.) once again reunited in 1996 and played to 500,000 people during a three-year period.<ref name="auto" />

In 1997 the band played three sold-out [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] [[benefit concert]]s. These shows featured a full symphony orchestra that was conducted by [[Paul Shaffer]] (from ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''). The band released a live two-disc benefit CD called ''[[Bosnia (album)|Bosnia]]'' recorded in [[Auburn Hills, Michigan]]. This live recording also featured Peter Frampton, Alto Reed and Howard Eddy Jr.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

In late 1998, Farner left the band and returned to his solo career. After a two year hiatus, Brewer and Schacher recruited lead vocalist [[Max Carl]] (of [[38 Special (band)|38 Special]]), former [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] lead guitarist [[Bruce Kulick]] and keyboardist [[Tim Cashion]] (Bob Seger, Robert Palmer) completed the new lineup.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

In 2005, Grand Funk Railroad was voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.michiganrockandrolllegends.com/mrrl-hall-of-fame/75-grand-funk-railroad |title=Michigan Rock and Roll Legends – GRAND FUNK RAILROAD |website=Michiganrockandrolllegends.com |access-date=October 11, 2019}}</ref>

In 2018, bassist [[Stanley Sheldon]] (ex-[[Peter Frampton]]) filled in for Schacher after Schacher's wife, Dena, died of cancer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grandfunkrailroad.com/OOTR2018.html|title=Grand Funk Railroad Tour Reports|website=Grandfunkrailroad.com|access-date=April 12, 2020}}</ref>

Grand Funk Railroad continues to tour, and kicked off its "The American Band Tour 2019", "Celebrating 50 Years of Funk" tour on January 17, 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.grandfunkrailroad.com/ |title=Grand Funk Railroad Official Web Site |website=Grandfunkrailroad.com |access-date=October 11, 2019}}</ref>

On June 25, 2019 ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Grand Funk Railroad among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite news |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=June 28, 2019 |date=June 25, 2019}}</ref>
