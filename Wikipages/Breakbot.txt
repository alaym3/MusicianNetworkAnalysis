'''Thibaut Jean-Marie Michel Berland''' (born October 5, 1981), known professionally as '''Breakbot''',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://justice-edbanger.xooit.com/t1833-Biographie-Discographie-de-Breakbot.htm |title=Biographie/Discographie de Breakbot |publisher=Justice-edbanger.xooit.com |access-date=2010-05-30}}</ref><ref name="Breakbot name"/> is a French musician, record producer and a DJ who has been signed with [[Ed Banger Records]] since May 2009.<ref name=DJZ>{{cite web|title=Breakbot Bio, Music, News & Shows|url=http://djz.com/featured_djs/breakbot/|publisher=DJZ.com|access-date=March 7, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614153324/http://www.djz.com/featured_djs/breakbot/|archive-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref>

==Career==
He studied at [[Supinfocom]], a computer graphics university. He co-directed the short film ''Overtime'' with Oury Atlan and Damien Ferrié.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0453181/ |website=IMDb.com|title=''Overtime''|access-date=2016-03-05}}</ref> The short won the [[Ottawa International Animation Festival]] award for "Best Graduate Film" in 2005 and the Internationales Trickfilmfestival Stuttgart "Young Animation Award" in 2006. Thibaut Berland also prepared advertisements and videos.

In 2007, he participated in the graphic design of the spaceship present on the first album of the group [[Justice (band)|Justice]], ''[[Cross (Justice album)|Cross]]''. Through his involvement with the design, he was introduced to [[Pedro Winter]], founder of the label [[Ed Banger Records]], who signed him.<ref>{{cite web|title=Brain Magazine - Interviews - Breakbot - Le Brian Wilson de l'Electro|url=https://www.brain-magazine.fr/article/interviews/2443-Breakbot---Le-Brian-Wilson-de-l_Electro|website=[[Brain Magazine]]|access-date=2021-03-24}}</ref>

Breakbot is most recognized for his remixes. His reworkings of songs by artists including [[Röyksopp]], [[Digitalism (band)|Digitalism]], and [[Chromeo]] are among his most popular.<ref name=DJZ/> The music video of "Baby I'm Yours" featuring Irfane was directed by Irina Dakeva and became a summer hit ''MTV Pulse'', France. The music video was nominated for "Best budget pop/dance/urban video" and "Best animation in a video" during the UK Music Video Awards on October 12, 2010.

In February 2016, he released his second album, ''Still Waters'', composed and produced with his frequent collaborator, Christopher Irfane Khan-Acito ("Irfane"). His track ''Star Tripper'' was included in ''[[Star Wars Headspace]]'', a Star-Wars themed music album released by [[Disney]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Breakbot Announces New Album For Feb 2016|url=http://stoneyroads.com/2016/01/breakbot-announces-new-album-for-feb-2016|website=Stoney Roads|access-date=6 February 2016}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
[[File:Breakbot 1.jpg|thumb|Breakbot at the [[Festival Internacional de Benicàssim]] 2016]]
His 2008 remix of [[Pnau]]'s song "Baby" appears in ''[[Gran Turismo 5]]'', a racing video game. Another one of his songs, "Penelope Pitstop", also features in the game. The song "Get Lost" appears in the 2016 racing video game ''[[Forza Horizon 3]]''.

Breakbot's position in popular culture is influenced by the similarities between "Baby I'm Yours" and 2012 chart hit "[[Treasure (Bruno Mars song)|Treasure]]" by [[Bruno Mars]]. "Treasure" was re-registered in [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] with new writing credits, which included him and Irfane Khan-Acito, due to the similarities with the former song. In May 2013, during an interview in [[Tiny Mix Tapes]], Breakbot explained that the boss of Because Music had mentioned, a year previously, that Mars wanted to cover "Baby I'm Yours". As Breakbot was busy finishing the album, however, "it did not happen". Breakbot called "Treasure" a "rip-off" of his song, however, he was "cool with it"; he explained that he also had many influences on his music "with lots of bits taken from here and there".<ref name="Breakbot name">{{cite web|url=https://mobile.ascap.com/aceclient/AceWeb/#ace/search/workID/884665059|title=Treasure Credits – Ascap Work ID: 884665059|work=[[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]]|date=April 1, 2016|access-date=November 6, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tinymixtapes.com/features/breakbot|title=Breakbot: Interview|last=Dorof|first=Jakob|work=[[Tiny Mix Tapes]]|publisher=Mr. P|date=May 2013|access-date=September 2, 2015}}</ref>

In late 2018, his single “Baby I’m Yours” became an [[Meme|Internet meme]] commonly paired with a voice clip of [[Paul Bremer]] announcing [[Operation Red Dawn|Saddam Hussein's capture]], with his famous words: "Ladies and gentlemen, we got [[Saddam Hussein|him]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/dec/20/ladies-and-gentlemen-we-got-him-the-evolution-of-one-of-2018s-best-memes|title=Ladies and gentlemen, we got him: the evolution of one of 2018's best memes|last=Zhou|first=Naaman|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=December 2018|access-date=September 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|author=Will Sommer|date=10 December 2018|title=Paul Bremer, Former Iraq Czar, is Utterly Confused How He Became an Internet Meme|publisher=The Daily Beast|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/paul-bremer-former-iraq-czar-is-utterly-confused-how-he-became-an-internet-meme?ref=scroll|access-date=5 February 2019}}</ref>
