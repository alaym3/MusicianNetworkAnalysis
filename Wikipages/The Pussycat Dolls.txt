'''The Pussycat Dolls''' are an American [[girl group]] and [[dance ensemble]], founded in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], by choreographer [[Robin Antin]] in 1995 as a [[burlesque]] troupe. At the suggestion of [[Jimmy Iovine]], Antin decided to take the burlesque troupe mainstream as a pop group.<ref name=adamw>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/always-nicoles-project-pussycat-dolls-became-pops-embittered/ |title='Always Nicole's project': How The Pussycat Dolls became pop's most embittered group |last=White |first=Adam |date=November 30, 2019 |work=The Telegraph|access-date=December 1, 2019 |language=en-GB |issn=0307-1235|archive-date=December 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191201133523/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/always-nicoles-project-pussycat-dolls-became-pops-embittered/|url-status=live}}</ref> Antin negotiated a record deal with [[Interscope Geffen A&M Records]] in 2003 turning the group into a music franchise comprising [[Nicole Scherzinger]], [[Carmit Bachar]], [[Ashley Roberts]], [[Jessica Sutta]], [[Melody Thornton]], and [[Kimberly Wyatt]]. Their debut single, "[[Sway (Luis Demetrio song)#The Pussycat Dolls version|Sway]]", was featured on the soundtrack of the 2004 film ''[[Shall We Dance? (2004 film)|Shall We Dance?]]''

The Pussycat Dolls achieved worldwide success with internationally successful singles "[[Don't Cha]]", "[[Stickwitu]]", "[[Buttons (The Pussycat Dolls song)|Buttons]]", and their [[Music recording certification|multi-platinum]] debut album ''[[PCD (album)|PCD]]'' (2005). However, despite their commercial success, the group was plagued by internal conflict due to the emphasis on Scherzinger, the group's lead vocalist, and the subordinate treatment of the other members. Bachar's departure from the group preceded the release of their second and final studio album ''[[Doll Domination]]'' (2008), which contains hit singles "[[When I Grow Up (The Pussycat Dolls song)|When I Grow Up]]", "[[I Hate This Part]]", and "[[Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)]]". Following the completion of their [[Doll Domination Tour|2009 world tour]], the group went on hiatus and fully disbanded in 2010. The original recording line-up, minus Thornton, announced their reunion in 2019 with [[Unfinished Business (tour)|an upcoming tour]] and a new album.

The Pussycat Dolls brand diversified into merchandise, [[Pussycat Dolls Present|reality television programs]], a [[Las Vegas]] act, product endorsements, spin-off recording groups ([[Girlicious]], [[Paradiso Girls]], [[G.R.L.]]), and other ventures. [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] ranked the Pussycat Dolls as the 80th most successful musical act of the 2000s.<ref name="Billboard-decade"/> The group has sold 55 million records worldwide,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZhRjnNLu3k |title=The Pussycat dolls Live BBC The One Show Interview 02/26/20 |date=February 27, 2020|access-date=March 17, 2020|archive-date=June 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200608012129/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZhRjnNLu3k%2F|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.northantstelegraph.co.uk/news/people/pussycat-dolls-announced-first-northampton-headliners-summer-1383176 |title=Pussycat Dolls announced as first Northampton headliners this summer |last=Roberts |first=Carly |date=February 3, 2020|access-date=March 17, 2020|archive-date=February 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228170910/https://www.northantstelegraph.co.uk/news/people/pussycat-dolls-announced-first-northampton-headliners-summer-1383176|url-status=live}}</ref> making them one of the [[List of best-selling girl groups|best-selling girl groups]] of all time.<ref name=pcdsales>{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/listen-to-nicole-scherzingers-new-album-big-fat-lie-3212/ |date=October 16, 2014 |last=Copsey |first=Rob |title=Listen to Nicole Scherzinger's new album Big Fat Lie |work=Official Charts Company|access-date=January 24, 2014|archive-date=November 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101012720/http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/listen-to-nicole-scherzingers-new-album-big-fat-lie-3212/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="mensxp">{{cite web |url=https://www.newmarketjournal.co.uk/news/pussycat-dolls-set-to-star-at-newmarket-nights-9098395/ |title=Pussycat Dolls set to star at Newmarket Nights |date=February 3, 2020|access-date=February 3, 2020|archive-date=February 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203113326/https://www.newmarketjournal.co.uk/news/pussycat-dolls-set-to-star-at-newmarket-nights-9098395/|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2012, the Pussycat Dolls ranked 100th on VH1's 100 Greatest Women in Music, and as the tenth all-girl group.<ref>{{cite web |last=Graham |first=Mark |url=http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2012-02-13/vh1s-100-greatest-women-in-music-complete-list/ |title=The 100 Greatest Women In Music &#124; VH1 Tuner |publisher=VH1.com |date=February 13, 2012 |access-date=May 31, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303101656/http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2012-02-13/vh1s-100-greatest-women-in-music-complete-list |archive-date=March 3, 2012}}</ref>

==History==
===1995–2002: Beginnings as burlesque dance troupe===
Antin began exploring the idea of a modern [[burlesque]] troupe during 1990 with Carla Kama and [[Christina Applegate]] as performers.<ref name=allmusicbio>{{cite web |title=((( The Pussycat Dolls > Biography ))) |publisher=[[AllMusic]].[[Rovi Corporation|Macrovision]] |url={{AllMusic |class=artist |id=p702645/biography|pure_url=yes}}| last=Jeffries|first=David| access-date=June 11, 2010}}</ref><ref name=reviewjournal>{{cite news |title=Neon: Beyond Burlesque |newspaper=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050413224425/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Apr-08-Fri-2005/weekly/26226584.html|archive-date=April 13, 2005 |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Apr-08-Fri-2005/weekly/26226584.html |last=Weatherford |first=Mike |date=April 8, 2005 |access-date=September 3, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.struttercabaret.com/carlakama/choreographer/bio/bio.html |title=Carla Kama Biography |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716155231/http://www.struttercabaret.com/carlakama/choreographer/bio/bio.html |archive-date=July 16, 2011}}</ref> The troupe began to perform in 1995, with a repertoire of 1950s and 1960s [[pop standard|popular music standards]] while dressed in [[lingerie]] or old-fashioned [[pin-up]] costumes. They secured a Thursday night residency at a [[Los Angeles]] nightclub, [[the Viper Room]], where they stayed from 1995 to 2001. They appeared briefly in the 1998 films ''Matters of Consequence'' (dancing to [[Henry Mancini|Mancini]]'s "[[Breakfast at Tiffany's: Music from the Motion Picture|Hub Caps and Tail Lights]]", and [[Keely Smith]]'s "When Your Lover has Gone"),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480557/ |title=Matters of Consequence (1999) |date=January 13, 1999 |work=IMDb|access-date=June 29, 2018|archive-date=February 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209051055/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480557/|url-status=live}}</ref> and ''The Treat'' (directed by [[Jonathan Gems]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120871/fullcredits#cast |title=The Treat |date=January 15, 1999|access-date=November 18, 2016 |via=IMDb|archive-date=June 20, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620101803/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120871/fullcredits#cast|url-status=live}}</ref> From 1995 to 2003 there were numerous guest vocalists, and many changes to the dance personnel.

The troupe received wider press coverage during June 1999, when ''[[Playboy]]'' featured a Pussycat Dolls pictorial, featuring at least seven contemporary members posing semi-nude (Kasey Campbell, Kiva Dawson, Antonietta Macri, Erica Breckels, Katie Bergold, Erica Gudis and Lindsley Allen).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vintageplayboymags.co.uk/90s/June/09.htm |title=Playboy Magazine June 1999 vol.46, no.6|access-date=November 18, 2016|archive-date=September 23, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923175735/http://www.vintageplayboymags.co.uk/90s/June/09.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> Three years later, the Pussycat Dolls moved to [[The Roxy Theatre|the Roxy]]. They were featured in magazines, television specials for [[MTV]] and [[VH1]], ad campaigns, and films. Some of the Pussycat Dolls appeared in the 2003 film ''[[Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle]]'',<ref name=allmusicbio/> dancing to Mancini's "[[The Pink Panther Theme]]". They were also featured in [[Pink (singer)|Pink]]'s "[[Trouble (Pink song)|Trouble]]" music video. Along with Applegate, [[Christina Aguilera]] and [[Carmen Electra]] (who was the group's lead performer for many of their shows) the troupe was featured in a ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' magazine shoot in 2002,<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.dotspotter.com/news/545425_The_Pussycat_Dolls_Maxim_Photo_Shoot_Video |title=The Pussycat Dolls Maxim Photo Shoot Video |publisher=theinsider.com |date=December 25, 2007 |access-date=September 3, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202203829/http://www.theinsider.com/index.htm |archive-date=February 2, 2012}}</ref> which increased public interest in them (Aguilera later appeared in the similarly themed 2010 film ''[[Burlesque (2010 musical film)|Burlesque]]'' directed by Robin Antin's brother [[Steve Antin|Steve]]).

Following their growing popularity, [[Interscope Geffen A&M Records]] [[music producer]]s [[Jimmy Iovine]] and [[Ron Fair]] became involved with the group helping them to transform into a franchise after [[Gwen Stefani]] was asked to perform with the group.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20166116,00.html |title=The Pussycat With Nine Lives |last=Stack |first=Tim |date=December 14, 2007 |publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]].

The only troupe members who remained after the re-casting process were Robin Antin, [[Carmit Bachar]], [[Cyia Batten]], Kasey Campbell, [[Ashley Roberts]], [[Jessica Sutta]] and [[Kimberly Wyatt]]. Electra, when asked about her lack of involvement with the group's evolution into a popular music group, said, "I was part of [the Pussycat Dolls] for over two years and did every show with them [...] but financially, I couldn't become part of their new music project [...] It was a sacrifice I couldn't make."<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/story/electra-i-couldnt-afford-to-be-a-pussycat-doll_12_04_2006 |title=Electra: 'I Couldn't Afford To Be A Pussycat Doll' |magazine=[[Contactmusic.com]] |date=April 26, 2006 |access-date=September 3, 2009 |archive-date=June 6, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606203351/http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/story/electra-i-couldnt-afford-to-be-a-pussycat-doll_12_04_2006 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Since the Pussycat Dolls were originally a burlesque dance troupe, Scherzinger and Thornton were the only members specifically hired for singing role when the group turned into a pop act in 2003.

===Nicole Scherzinger as lead singer===
Critics have taken a major swipe at the group for their overemphasis of Scherzinger. Margeaux Watson of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said, "there are two kinds of girl groups: those anchored by a superstar ([[The Supremes]], [[Destiny's Child]]), and those made up of charismatic personalities endowed with limited individual gifts ([[Spice Girls]], [[TLC (group)|TLC]]). The Pussycat Dolls are neither—they're a brand, not a band. This follow-up to 2005's multi-platinum ''PCD'' finds lead Doll Nicole Scherzinger in the spotlight, and she's no [[Beyoncé]]. As for the others, well... can you name them?

[[Kaya Jones]], who initially auditioned as a vocalist for the group, said: "Nicole was always someone who wanted to be in the spotlight and would do pretty much anything to get it.

I got into the group to sing. That was made very clear to me. But it became more and more apparent what was going on.

===Sexual image===
Following their performance on ''[[The X Factor: Celebrity]]'' in November 2019, the group were accused of over-sexualisation and being raunchy for wearing sheer PVC outfits. Over 400 viewers complained to British broadcast regulator [[Ofcom]].<ref name="NZcity 2020-02-13">{{cite web |url=https://home.nzcity.co.nz/news/article.aspx?id=306003 |title=Nicole Scherzinger thinks The Pussycat Dolls have "evolved" over the last decade |website=home.nzcity.co.nz |author=BANG showbiz |date=February 13, 2020 |access-date=February 13, 2020 |archive-date=January 11, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210111180917/https://home.nzcity.co.nz/news/article.aspx?id=306003 |url-status=live}}</ref> Despite a more muted performance on ''[[Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway]]'' in February 2020 that poked fun at their ''X Factor'' performance and featured some censorship, the group garnered further complaints to Ofcom albeit a smaller amount.<ref name="Chronicle 2020-02-25">{{cite web |url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/pussycat-dolls-saturday-takeaway-performance-17811567 |title=Pussycat Doll hits back at Saturday Night Takeaway critics after performance sparks Ofcom complaints |website=The Chronicle (North East) |last=Duke |first=Simon |date=February 25, 2020 |access-date=February 27, 2020 |archive-date=February 26, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200226153610/https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/pussycat-dolls-saturday-takeaway-performance-17811567 |url-status=live}}</ref> Scherzinger spoke out against the media and negative coverage, comparing the group's message to American singer-songwriter [[Lizzo]] who is an advocate for body awareness, saying "If you have people like Lizzo leading the movement of accepting yourself and they don't get any criticism, then why are we getting this criticism? When we perform, we perform from a place of passion and power. We're not floundering out there just trying to be cute. We come like warriors out there and people feel empowered by that."<ref name="NZcity 2020-02-13"/> Barchar addressed criticism on their second performance by saying "being on Ant & Dec's show was hysterical; they are so good at what they do and the way they made light of the whole censorship thing was amazing. It's great that we got to be silly with it and we had a blast." She supported early comments by Scherzinger that the intention and aims of the group's performances was always about empowerment, saying "everyone has an opinion on what we do, and while I think the power of a woman can be intimidating, it's all about the intention of our performances".<ref name="Chronicle 2020-02-25"/>

Wyatt has also defended the group's image saying that it is an important message around female empowerment, during an appearance on ''The Morning Show'', Wyatt talked about bring her kids to rehearsals, "[I love] teaching them what it means to be a Pussycat Doll and own your space as a female.

Referring to their provocative image, Sutta told ''The Daily Telegraph Australia'' that she felt that [[ageism]] is rife within the music industry but that times were changing, "You’ve got J-Lo at 50 who’s looking as fabulous as ever, and Lizzo who is all about self-love and owning it.

Later in March 2020, during an interview with [[Network Ten]]'s ''[[The Project (Australian TV program)|The Project]]'', Scherzinger acknowledged that the costumes for the performance were provocative but said "but we are women now and like literally as we say, (our bums) were hanging out and it takes courage to be that, you know it is vulnerable wearing as much as that, it takes a lot of courage to do it and we always do everything with confidence with the intent of empowering others and all of our women out there and anyone who feels they relate to us".<ref name="News AU 2020-02-04">{{cite web |url=https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/nicole-scherzingers-incredibly-awkward-interview-on-the-project/news-story/5059ff13d1c5dd1296765f7abc9a1ceb |title=The Pussycat Dolls' Nicole Scherzinger Went On 'The Project' Only To Endure A Woeful Interview |website=News.com.au |date=March 4, 2020 |access-date=March 4, 2020 |archive-date=March 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200304110706/https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/nicole-scherzingers-incredibly-awkward-interview-on-the-project/news-story/5059ff13d1c5dd1296765f7abc9a1ceb |url-status=live}}</ref> ''News AU'' and ''Junkee'' both criticised hosts of ''The Project'' for focusing on a perceived sexual nature of their dance moves and for making the interview with Scherzinger awkward.<ref name="Junkee 2020-03-04">{{cite web |url=https://junkee.com/nicole-scherzinger-pussycat-dolls-project-interview/245318 |title=The Pussycat Dolls' Nicole Scherzinger Went On 'The Project' Only To Endure A Woeful Interview |website=Junkee |last=Richards |first=Jared |date=March 4, 2020 |access-date=March 4, 2020 |archive-date=March 24, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200324043233/https://junkee.com/nicole-scherzinger-pussycat-dolls-project-interview/245318 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="News AU 2020-02-04"/> One of ''The Project's'' hosts [[Waleed Aly]] asked [[sexism|sexist]] questions such as whether the girls "fight over who wore the best tube tops and low rise jeans?".<ref name="Music News 2020-03-05">{{cite web |url=https://www.music-news.com/news/UK/129462/Nicole-Scherzinger-fails-to-hide-irritation-during-bizarre-TV-interview |title=Nicole Scherzinger fails to hide irritation during bizarre TV interview |author=Newsdesk |website=Music-news.com |date=March 5, 2020 |access-date=March 5, 2020 |archive-date=March 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200316235414/https://www.music-news.com/news/UK/129462/Nicole-Scherzinger-fails-to-hide-irritation-during-bizarre-TV-interview |url-status=live}}</ref> Jared Richards (''Junkee'') said "it’s a mess, absolutely dismissive of Scherzinger as a person and The Pussycat Dolls as an act...
