'''LANY''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|eɪ|n|i}}, an acronym for "Los Angeles New York") is an American [[pop music|pop]] band from [[Los Angeles]]. Formed in [[Nashville]] in 2014, the band consists of Paul Jason Klein, Charles Leslie "Les" Priest, and Jake Clifford Goss.

Signed to [[Polydor Records|Polydor]] and [[Interscope Records]], the band have released three top 40 albums: ''[[LANY (album)|LANY]]'' (2017), ''[[Malibu Nights]]'' (2018), and ''[[Mama's Boy (album)|Mama's Boy]]'' (2020). Additionally, they have released a slew of singles, their most successful being the RIAA-certified "ILYSB" (2015), the Julia Michaels collaboration "[[Okay (LANY and Julia Michaels song)|Okay]]" (2019), and "[[Mean It (Lauv and LANY song)|Mean It]]" (2019) with [[Lauv]]. In 2020, they released their third studio album ''[[Mama's Boy (album)|Mama's Boy]]'', which was followed by their fourth album, ''[[gg bb xx]]'', in September 2021.

== Music career ==
=== 2014–2017: Musical beginnings and ''LANY'' ===
LANY was formed in March 2014 when Paul Jason Klein, who had a small solo career, flew to [[Nashville]] to meet up with friends Jake Goss and Les Priest. Previously, Goss and Priest had a separate project by the name of WRLDS, but this was discontinued after the formation of LANY.<ref name="teenvogue">{{cite web|url=http://www.teenvogue.com/story/lany-band-ilysb-music-interview|title=Heard of LANY? Well Listen Up, Because They're About to Become Your New Favorite Band {{!}} Teen Vogue|last=Firman|first=Tehrene|website=Teen Vogue|access-date=March 9, 2016}}</ref> The following month they anonymously uploaded two songs, "Hot Lights" and "Walk Away", to [[SoundCloud]] in order to differentiate between their old and new projects. Their debut [[Extended play|EP]], ''Acronyms'', followed later that year, with the song "ILYSB" generating significant interest online. Singles "Made in Hollywood" and "Bad, Bad, Bad" soon followed, along with the reveal of their identities.

LANY is an acronym for "Los Angeles New York". Klein explained the name in an interview:<blockquote>"We knew we wanted a four-letter word because of design and aesthetic purposes, but as you can imagine, all the four-letter words in the entire world are taken. We moved to acronyms and for a while we thought we would be TTYL, but then we decided we didn’t want to be 13 for the rest of our lives. I eventually thought of the span across the country from L.A. to New York, and at first I was thinking it would be L-A-N-Y, but people kept getting confused on how to pronounce it when I told them, saying things like 'L-A-and-Y?' So then we’re like forget it—let's call ourselves LANY, pronounced Lay-Nee."<ref name="teenvogue"/></blockquote>
