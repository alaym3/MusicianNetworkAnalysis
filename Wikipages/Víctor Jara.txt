==Early life==
{{More citations needed section|date=January 2017}}
Víctor Jara was born in 1932 to two farmers, Manuel Jara and Amanda Martínez. His exact place of birth is uncertain. For some, he was born in [[San Ignacio, Chile|San Ignacio]], near Chillán; but there are also rumors he could have been born in Quiriquina, one of the small towns nearby San Ignacio. In early childhood, moved with his family to Lonquén. His father was illiterate and encouraged his children to work from an early age to help the family survive, rather than attend school. By the age of 6, Jara was already working on the land. His father could not support the family on his earnings as a peasant at the Ruiz-Tagle estate, nor was he able to find stable work. He took to drinking and became increasingly violent. His relationship with his wife deteriorated, and he left the family to look for work when Víctor was still a child.

Jara's mother raised him and his siblings, and insisted that they get a good education. A [[mestiza]] with deep [[Araucanian]] roots in southern Chile, she was [[autodidactic|self-taught]], and played the guitar and the piano. She also performed as a singer, with a repertory of traditional folk songs that she used for local functions like weddings and funerals.<ref>Jara, Joan. ''Víctor: An Unfinished Song'', 24-27</ref>

She died when Jara was 15, leaving him to make his own way. He began to study to be an accountant, but soon moved into a [[seminary]], where he studied for the priesthood. After a couple of years, however, he became disillusioned with the [[Catholic Church]] and left the seminary. Subsequently, he spent several years in army service before returning to his hometown to pursue interests in [[folk music]] and [[theatre|theater]].<ref name="notablebiographies.com">{{Cite web|title = Victor Jara Biography - life, family, childhood, children, parents, death, wife, school|url = http://www.notablebiographies.com/supp/Supplement-Fl-Ka/Jara-Victor.html|website = www.notablebiographies.com|access-date = 22 October 2015}}</ref>

==Musical career==
After joining the choir at the [[University of Chile]] in Santiago, Jara was convinced by a choir-mate to pursue a career in theater. He subsequently joined the university's theater program and earned a scholarship for talent.<ref name="notablebiographies.com" /> He appeared in several of the university's plays, gravitating toward those with social themes, such as Russian playwright [[Maxim Gorky]]'s ''The Lower Depths'', a depiction of the hardships of lower-class life.<ref name="notablebiographies.com" />

In 1957, he met [[Violeta Parra]], a singer who had steered folk music in Chile away from the rote reproduction of rural materials toward modern song composition rooted in traditional forms, and who had established musical community centers called ''peñas'' to incorporate folk music into the everyday life of modern Chileans. Jara absorbed these lessons and began singing with a group called Cuncumén, with whom he continued his explorations of Chile's traditional music<ref name="notablebiographies.com" /> (working as a guitarist and vocalist from 1957 to 1963<ref>{{cite web |title=Cuncumén |url=http://www.musicapopular.cl/grupo/cuncumen/ |website=Cuncumén {{!}} MusicaPopular.cl |access-date=30 June 2021 |language=es}}</ref>). He was deeply influenced by the folk music of Chile and other Latin American countries, and by artists such as Parra, [[Atahualpa Yupanqui]], and the poet [[Pablo Neruda]]. In the 1960s, Jara started specializing in folk music and sang at Santiago's La Peña de Los Parra, owned by [[Ángel Parra (singer-songwriter)|Ángel Parra]]. Through these activities, he became involved in the [[Nueva canción|Nueva Canción]] movement of Latin American folk music.

In 1966, Víctor released his first album homonymous, by the record company "Demon", being the only album released under this label and the Víctor Jara's first solo work,<ref>{{cite web |title=Víctor Jara|url=http://www.musicapopular.cl/3.0/index2.php?action=RGlzY28=&var=NjU= |access-date=30 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027154727/http://www.musicapopular.cl/3.0/index2.php?action=RGlzY28=&var=NjU=|archive-date=27 October 2011}}</ref> the album would later be re-released under the titles ''Canto a lo humano'' and ''Sus mejores canciones'', and in 2001 an reissue on CD by [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music Chile]] was released,<ref name="Víctor Jara (1966)">{{cite web |title=Víctor Jara Discography: Víctor Jara (1966) |url=https://nuevacancion.net/victor/jara66.html |website=nuevacancion.net |access-date=30 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224031552/http://www.nuevacancion.net/victor/jara66.html |archive-date=24 February 2012}}</ref> with the original title. This version on [[CD]] also included five bonus tracks, four of which are songs by Víctor Jara along with [[Cuncumén]].

The album includes some Jara's versions of some [[Latin America]]n [[folk music|folk songs]], such as; "La flor que anda de mano en mano", and "Ojitos verdes", two [[Chile]]an folk songs, "La cocinerita", an [[Argentina|Argenti]]nian folk song, or "Ja jai", a [[Bolivia]]n traditional.<ref name="Víctor Jara (1966)" /> The authorship of this album, as well as its singles, was in the hands of [[Camilo Fernández]], owner of the Demon record company, from its launch in 1966 until 2001, when he recently transferred the rights to the widow of Víctor Jara, after years of profiting from the album (as well as with others from [[Patricio Manns]], [[Isabel Parra|Isabel]] and [[Ángel Parra (singer-songwriter)|Ángel Parra]], among others) without ever financially rewarding its authors or family.<ref>{{cite news |author1=La Nación |author1-link=La Nación (Chile) |title=Camilo al cielo |url=http://www.lanacion.cl/prontus_noticias/site/artic/20050910/pags/20050910193616.html |access-date=30 June 2021 |date=11 September 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426085655/http://www.lanacion.cl/prontus_noticias/site/artic/20050910/pags/20050910193616.html |archive-date=26 April 2009 |page=lanación.cl |language=es}}</ref>

In 1967 released their second album homonymous, this album apart from the controversial song "The appeared" includes Jara's covers of some folk songs from [[Chile]], [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]] or [[Spain]] as; «Despedimiento del angelito», «Ay mi palomita», «Casi, casi», «Qué alegres son las obreras» or «Romance del enamorado y la muerte». Also, the album was subsequently released under the name of ''Desde longuén hasta siempre'' with a variation of different covers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Victor Jara Discography: Víctor Jara (1967) |url=http://www.nuevacancion.net/victor/jara67.html |website=nuevacancion.net |access-date=10 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224031600/http://www.nuevacancion.net/victor/jara67.html |archive-date=24 February 2012}}</ref> In 1968, Jara released his first collaborative album entitled, "[[Canciones folklóricas de América]]" (Folkloric Songs of America), with [[Quilapayun]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Víctor Jara + Quilapayún: Canciones folklóricas de América (1968) {{!}} PERRERAC |url=https://perrerac.org/chile/vctor-jara-quilapayn-canciones-folklricas-de-amrica-1967/798/ |access-date=12 July 2021 |language=es |date=8 December 2018}}</ref> In 1970, he had left his theater work in favor of a career in music. His songs were inspired by a combination of traditional folk music and left-wing political activism. From this period, some of his best-known songs are "Plegaria a un Labrador" ("Prayer to a Worker") and "Te Recuerdo Amanda" ("I Remember You Amanda").

==Political activism==
Early in his recording career, Jara showed a knack for antagonizing conservative Chileans, releasing a traditional comic song called "La beata" that depicted a religious woman with a crush on the priest to whom she goes for [[Confession (religion)|confession]]. The song was banned on radio stations and removed from record shops, but the controversy only added to Jara's reputation among young and progressive Chileans.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">[http://www.news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/165363.stm "'They Couldn't Kill His Songs,'"] BBC News, World: Americas]</ref> More serious in the eyes of the Chilean right wing was Jara's growing identification with the socialist movement led by [[Salvador Allende]]. After visits to [[Cuba]] and the [[Soviet Union]] in the early 1960s, Jara had joined the [[Communist Party of Chile|Communist Party]]. The personal met the political in his songs about the poverty he had experienced firsthand.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk" />

[[File:Victor-Jara-in-Helsinki-1969.jpg|thumb|right|In 1969, Jara appeared in [[Helsinki]] protests against the [[Vietnam War]].]]
Jara's songs spread outside Chile and were performed by American folk artists.<ref name="allmusic.com">"Victor Jara," ''All Music Guide'', http://www.allmusic.com (16 January 2007)</ref> His popularity was due not only to his songwriting skills but also to his exceptional power as a performer. He took a decisive turn toward political confrontation with his 1969 song "Preguntas por Puerto Montt" ("Questions About Puerto Montt"), which took direct aim at a government official ([[Edmundo Pérez Zujovic]]) who had ordered police to attack squatters in the town of [[Puerto Montt]]. The Chilean political situation deteriorated after the official was assassinated, and right-wing thugs beat up Jara on one occasion.<ref name="allmusic.com" />

In 1970, Jara supported Allende, the [[Popular Unity (Chile)|Popular Unity]] coalition candidate for president, volunteering for political work and playing free concerts.<ref>Jara, Joan. ''Víctor: An Unfinished Song,''</ref> He composed "[[Venceremos (song)|Venceremos]]" ("We Will Triumph"), the theme song of Allende's Popular Unity movement, and welcomed Allende's election to the Chilean presidency in 1970. After the election, Jara continued to speak in support of Allende and played an important role in the new administration's efforts to reorient Chilean culture.<ref>Mularski, Jedrek. ''Music, Politics, and Nationalism in Latin America: Chile During the Cold War Era''. Amherst: Cambria Press. {{ISBN|978-1-60497-888-9}}.</ref>

He and his wife, [[Joan Jara]], were key participants in a cultural renaissance that swept Chile, organizing cultural events that supported the country's new socialist government. He set poems by Pablo Neruda to music and performed at a ceremony honoring him after Neruda received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1972. Throughout rumblings of a right-wing coup, Jara held on to his teaching job at [[University of Santiago, Chile#Universidad Técnica del Estado|Chile's Technical University]]. His popular success during this time, as both a musician and a Communist, earned him a concert in [[Moscow]]. So successful was he that the Soviet Union tried to latch onto his popularity, claiming in their media that his vocal prowess was the result of surgery he had undergone while in Moscow.<ref>{{Cite book|title = OUR MAN IN CHILE, OR VICTOR JARA'S POSTHUMOUS LIFE IN SOVIET MEDIA AND POPULAR CULTURE|last = Minkova|first = Yuliya|publisher = Virginia Tech|year = 2013|pages = 608}}</ref>

Backed by the United States, which opposed Allende's [[socialist]] politics, the Chilean military staged a [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|coup d'état on 11 September 1973]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=The Trial of Henry Kissinger |year=2001 |publisher=Twelve |location=New York |isbn=978-1455522972 |page=304}}</ref> resulting in the death of Allende and the installation of [[Augusto Pinochet]] as dictator. At the moment of the coup, Jara was on his way to the Technical University (today the [[Universidad de Santiago de Chile|Universidad de Santiago]]). That night, he slept at the university along with other teachers and students, and sang to raise morale.

==Torture and murder==
[[File:Victor Jarra Nicha.jpg|thumb|Víctor Jara's grave in the General Cemetery of Santiago. The note reads: "Until victory..."]]
After the coup, Pinochet's soldiers rounded up Chileans who were believed to be involved with leftist groups, including Allende's Popular Unity party. On the morning of 12 September 1973, Jara was taken prisoner, along with thousands of others, and imprisoned inside [[Víctor Jara Stadium|Chile Stadium]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/sep/09/world/fg-stadium9|title=Stadium's Renaming an Ode to Singer Martyred There|date=9 September 2003|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|access-date=12 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Victor-Jara|title=Victor Jara - Chilean musician|access-date=20 July 2016}}</ref> The guards there tortured him, smashing his hands and fingers, and then mocked him by asking him to play the guitar. Jara instead sang the Chilean protest song [[Venceremos (song)|Venceremos]]. Soon after, he was killed with a gunshot to the head, and his body was riddled with more than 40 bullets.<ref>Augustyn, Adam. "Victor Jara Chilean Musician." Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, n.d. Web. 9 December 2015.

According to the BBC <ref name="bbc.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20200812-vctor-jara-the-folk-singer-murdered-for-his-music|title = Víctor Jara: The folk singer murdered for his music}}</ref> "There are many conflicting accounts of Jara’s last days but the 2019 Netflix documentary Massacre at the Stadium pieces together a convincing narrative. As a famous musician and prominent supporter of Allende, Jara was swiftly recognised on his way into the stadium. An army officer threw a lit cigarette on the ground, made Jara crawl for it, then stamped on his wrists. Jara was first separated from the other detainees, then beaten and tortured in the bowels of the stadium. At one point, he defiantly sang Venceremos (We Will Win), Allende’s 1970 election anthem, through split lips. On the morning of the 16th, according to a fellow detainee, Jara asked for a pen and notebook and scribbled the lyrics to Estadio Chile, which were later smuggled out of the stadium: “How hard it is to sing when I must sing of horror/ Horror which I am living, horror which I am dying.” Two hours later, he was shot dead, then his body was riddled with machine-gun bullets and dumped in the street. He was 40."

After his murder, Jara's body was displayed at the entrance of Chile Stadium for other prisoners to see. It was later discarded outside the stadium along with the bodies of other civilian prisoners who had been killed by the Chilean Army.<ref name="Complaint: Jara v. Barriento">{{cite web|url=http://cja.org/downloads/COMPLAINT.9.4.pdf|title=Complaint: Jara v. Barriento|publisher=Official Florida court legal filing|access-date=5 September 2013}}</ref> His body was found by civil servants and brought to a morgue, where one of them was able to identify him and contact his wife, Joan. She took his body and gave him a quick and clandestine burial in the general cemetery before she fled the country into exile.

Forty-two years later, former Chilean military officers were charged with his murder.<ref>{{cite news |title=Former Chilean military officers charged in 1973 murder of singer Víctor Jara |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/23/chile-military-officers-victor-jara-killing |access-date=23 July 2015 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=23 July 2015}}</ref>

==Legal actions==
On 16 May 2008, retired colonel Mario Manríquez Bravo, who was the chief of security at Chile Stadium as the coup was carried out, was the first to be convicted in Jara's death.<ref name=Jaraconvict>{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/446834 |title=Judge rules in Pinochet-era case of murdered singer  |agency=Reuters |work=Stuff.co.nz |date=16 May 2008 |access-date=6 June 2015}}</ref> Judge Juan Eduardo Fuentes, who oversaw Bravo's conviction, then decided to close the case,<ref name=Jaraconvict /> a decision Jara's family soon appealed.<ref name=Jaraconvict /> In June 2008, Judge Fuentes re-opened the investigation and said he would examine 40 new pieces of evidence provided by Jara's family.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7435128.stm |work=BBC News |title=New probe into Victor Jara murder |date=4 June 2008 |access-date=27 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/victor-jara-former-pinochet-general-found-liable-torture-and-murder-celebrated-folk-singer-a7106811.html|title = This woman waited 43 years to secure justice for her slain husband|date = 28 June 2016}}</ref>

On 28 May 2009, José Adolfo Paredes Márquez, a 54-year-old former Army conscript arrested the previous week in San Sebastián, Chile, was formally charged with Jara's murder. Following his arrest, on 1 June 2009, the police investigation identified the officer who had shot Jara in the head. The officer played [[Russian roulette]] with Jara by placing a single round in his revolver, spinning the cylinder, placing the muzzle against Jara's head, and pulling the trigger. The officer repeated this a couple of times until a shot fired and Jara fell to the ground. The officer then ordered two conscripts (one of them Paredes) to finish the job by firing into Jara's body. A judge ordered Jara's body to be [[Exhumation|exhumed]] in an effort to gather more information about his death.<ref name="exhumed">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8084201.stm |title=Chilean singer Jara is exhumed |date=4 June 2009 |publisher=BBC |access-date=5 June 2009}}</ref><ref name="A oficial que ajustició a Víctor Jara, le decían &quot;El Loco&quot;">{{cite web |title=A oficial que ajustició a Víctor Jara, le decían "El Loco" |url=http://www.lanacion.cl/prontus_noticias_v2/site/artic/20090601/pags/20090601020443.html |work=Red Nacion |access-date=17 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017063426/http://www.lanacion.cl/prontus_noticias_v2/site/artic/20090601/pags/20090601020443.html |archive-date=17 October 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref name="The Guardian">{{cite web |last=Carroll |first=Rory |title=Ex-Pinochet army conscript charged with folk singer Victor Jara's murder |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/28/chile-regime-murder-charge-victor-jara |work=The Guardian |date=28 May 2009 |access-date=17 October 2013}}</ref>

Barrientos No. 3:13-cv-1075-J-99MMH-JBT (2013). |url=http://cja.org/article.php?id=1361 |access-date=5 September 2013 |newspaper=Center for Justice and Accountability |date=4 September 2013}}</ref>

The specific claims were that:
* On 11 September 1973, troops from the Arica Regiment of the Chilean Army, specifically from [[La Serena, Chile|La Serena]], attacked the university where Jara taught. The troops prohibited civilians from entering or leaving the university premises. During the afternoon of 12 September 1973, military personnel entered the university and illegally detained hundreds of professors, students, and administrators. Víctor Jara was among those arbitrarily detained on the campus and was subsequently transferred to Chile Stadium, where he was tortured and killed. 
* In the course of transporting and processing the civilian prisoners, Captain Fernando Polanco Gallardo, a commanding officer in military intelligence, recognized Jara as the well-known folk singer whose songs addressed social inequality, and who had supported President Allende's government. Captain Polanco separated Jara from the group and beat him severely. He then transferred Jara, along with some of the other civilians, to the stadium.
* Throughout his detention in the locker room of the stadium, Jara was in the physical custody of Lieutenant Barrientos, soldiers under his command, or other members of the Chilean Army who acted in accordance with the army's plan to commit human rights abuses against civilians.
* The arbitrary detention, torture, and extrajudicial killing of Jara and other detainees were part of a widespread, systematic attack on civilians by the Chilean Army from 11 to 15 September 1973. Barrientos knew, or should have known, about these attacks, if for no other reason than that he was present for and participated in them.<ref name="Complaint: Jara v. Barriento" />

==Legacy==
Joan Jara currently lives in Chile and runs the Víctor Jara Foundation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sreyes.org/old/vjfndt.htm|title=FUNDACION VICTOR JARA|access-date=20 July 2016}}</ref> which was established on 4 October 1994 with the goal of promoting and continuing Jara's work. She publicized a poem that Jara wrote before his death about the conditions of the prisoners in the stadium. The poem, written on a piece of paper that was hidden inside the shoe of a friend, was never named, but it is commonly known as "[[Estadio Chile (poem)|Estadio Chile]]". (Chile Stadium, now known as Víctor Jara Stadium,<ref>Waldstein, David. ''[[The New York Times]]'', 18 June 2015. Web. 9 December 2015. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/19/sports/soccer/in-chiles-national-stadium-dark-past-shadows-copa-america-matches.html?_r=1 In Chile’s National Stadium, Dark Past Shadows Copa América Matches]"</ref> is often confused with the [[Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez Prádanos|Estadio Nacional]], or National Stadium.)

Joan also distributed recordings of her husband's music, which became known worldwide. His music began to resurface in Chile in 1981. Nearly 800 cassettes of early, nonpolitical Jara songs<ref>{{cite journal|last=E.|first=Morris, Nancy|date=1 July 1984|title=Canto porque es necesario cantar: The New Song Movement in Chile, 1973-1983|journal=Research Papers|url=http://repository.unm.edu/handle/1928/9709|access-date=20 July 2016}}</ref> were confiscated on the "grounds that they violated an internal security law". The importer was given jail time but released six months later. By 1982, Jara's records were being openly sold throughout Santiago.<ref>Morris, Nancy E.

"[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/06/victor-jara-folk-singer-chile-/?page=all Murdered Chilean Folk Singer Laid to Rest after 36 Years]"</ref> Thousands of Chileans attended his reburial, after his body was exhumed, to pay their respects. President [[Michelle Bachelet]]—also a victim of the Pinochet regime, having spent years in exile—said: "Finally, after 36 years, Victor can rest in peace. He is a hero for the left, and he is known worldwide, even though he continues buried in the general cemetery where his widow originally buried him."

Jara has been commemorated not only by Latin American artists, but also by global bands such as [[U2]] and [[The Clash]].<ref name="theguardian.com" /> U2 has given concerts at Chile' [[Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez Prádanos|National Stadium]] in homage not only to Jara, but also to the many others who suffered under the Pinochet dictatorship.

Although most of the master recordings of Jara's music were burned under Pinochet's military dictatorship, his wife managed to get recordings out of Chile, which were later copied and distributed worldwide. She later wrote an account of Jara's life and music titled ''Víctor: An Unfinished Song''.

Since his death, Jara has been honored in numerous ways:
* ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named him one of the fifteen top protest artists.<ref name="Complaint: Jara v. Barriento" />
* On 22 September 1973, less than two weeks after Jara's death, the Soviet astronomer [[Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh]] named a newly found [[asteroid]] ''2644 Víctor Jara''.
* The American folk singer [[Phil Ochs]], who met and performed with Jara during a tour of South America, organized a benefit concert in his memory in New York in 1974. Titled "An Evening With Salvador Allende", the concert featured Ochs, [[Bob Dylan]], [[Pete Seeger]], and [[Arlo Guthrie]].
* The anthology ''For Neruda, for Chile'' contains a section called "The Chilean Singer", with poems dedicated to Jara.{{sfn|Lowenfels|1975|pages=79–90}}
* An [[East Germany|East German]] biographical movie called ''El Cantor'' ("The Singer") was made in 1978. It was directed by Jara's friend [[Dean Reed]], who also played the part of Jara. That same year, the Dutch-Swedish singer-songwriter [[Cornelis Vreeswijk]] released an album of Jara songs translated into Swedish, ''[[Cornelis sjunger Victor Jara]]'' ("Cornelis sings Victor Jara").
*In 1989 Simple Minds dedicated Street Fighting Years track to Victor Jara.
* In the late 1990s, British actress [[Emma Thompson]] started to work on a screenplay that she planned to use as the basis for a movie about Jara.

* [[Bruce Springsteen]] and the [[E Street Band]]'s ''[[Wrecking Ball Tour]]'' made a stop in Chile on 12 September 2013, just days before the 40th anniversary of Jara's death. Springsteen, guitarist [[Nils Lofgren]] and trumpet player Curt Ramm paid tribute to Jara by covering his song "Manifiesto", which Springsteen sang in Spanish. In a short speech before the song, Springsteen said (in Spanish): "In 1988, we played for Amnesty International in Mendoza, Argentina, but Chile was in our hearts. We met many families of ''desaparecidos'', which had pictures of their loved ones. It was a moment that stays with me forever. If you are a political musician, Víctor Jara remains a great inspiration. It’s a gift to be here, and I take it with humbleness."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://backstreets.com/news.html |title=Springsteen News |publisher=Backstreets.com |access-date=20 May 2014}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
* "Cancion Protesta" by [[Aterciopelados]], a Colombian rock band, is a tribute to protest songs.
