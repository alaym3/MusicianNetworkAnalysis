== Biography ==
Wax was born on May 31, 1972, with the birth name Cho Hye-Ri. Cho graduated from the Department of Postmodern Music at [[Kyung Hee University]]. Although she has been professionally active since 1998, her personal life has been mostly veiled from the public.

== Career ==
Her debut as a singer was as lead vocalist of the band Dog in 1998. The band only released one album, ''DOG-1st''. The title track of the album was "Kyung Ah's Day", and the album also included nine other songs. After Dog disbanded, she made her solo debut with the stage name Wax in 2000. Her debut album as a soloist was  ''Vol. 1: The Diary of Mom'', with a debut song called "Oppa", a cover version (without the suggestive lyrics) of [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s "She Bop". As of 2012, she has released nine full-length albums and nine other albums. In addition, she has released songs for the original soundtracks of several dramas.

In 2007, Wax made her debut as a musical actress. She was cast as the main actress for the musical ''Fixing My Makeup'', which had a plot based on her song of the same name.
