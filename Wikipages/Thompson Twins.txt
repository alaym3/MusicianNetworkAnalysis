'''Thompson Twins''' were a British [[Pop music|pop]] band that formed in April 1977.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia">{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=David |title=Guinness Rockopedia |url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessrockoped0000unse/page/448 |url-access=registration |publisher=Guinness Publishing Ltd. |location=London |edition=1st |year=1998 |page=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessrockoped0000unse/page/448 448] |isbn=0-85112-072-5}}</ref> Initially a [[New wave music|new wave]] group, they switched to a more mainstream pop sound and achieved considerable popularity during the mid-1980s, scoring a string of hits in the United Kingdom, the United States, and around the world. In 1993, they changed their name to [[Babble (band)|Babble]], to reflect their change in music from pop to [[Dub music|dub]]-influenced [[Chill-out music|chill-out]]. They continued as Babble until 1996, at which point the group permanently dissolved.

The band was named after the two bumbling detectives [[Thomson and Thompson]] in [[Hergé]]'s comic strip ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]''.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> At various stages they had up to seven members, but their best-known incarnation was as a trio between 1982 and 1986. The band became a prominent act in the US during the [[Second British Invasion]], and in 1985 performed at [[Live Aid]] in [[Philadelphia]], where they were joined onstage by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/>

==Career==
===Early days===
In 1977, the original Thompson Twins line-up consisted of [[Tom Bailey (musician)|Tom Bailey]] (born 18 January 1956, [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], [[Yorkshire]])<ref>[http://www.spock.com/Tom-Bailey-(Thompson-Twins) ] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.today/20090118005714/http://www.spock.com/Tom-Bailey-(Thompson-Twins) |date=18 January 2009}}</ref> on bass and vocals, Pete Dodd on guitar and vocals, John Roog on guitar, and Jon Podgorski (known as "Pod") on drums.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/thompson-twins-mn0000567570/biography |title=Thompson Twins &#124; Biography |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=31 January 2014}}</ref> Dodd and Roog first met when they were both 13 years old.

Arriving in London with very little money, they lived as [[squatter]]s in Lillieshall Road, [[Clapham]]. Future Thompson Twins member [[Alannah Currie]] (born 20 September 1957, [[Auckland]], New Zealand) lived in another squat in the same street, which is how she met Bailey. It was in this ramshackle and run-down house that they found an illegal way of "borrowing" electricity from the house next door. Bailey described them, laughingly, as having been "spongers" at the time, for they were living on very little money, and scavenging everything they could lay their hands on. He even said that the only instruments they had were bought, or had been stolen or borrowed. Dodd managed to get a [[council flat]] (public housing) not far away. Their [[Road crew|roadie]] at that time was John Hade, who lived in the same house, and who later became their manager.

As Podgorski had decided to stay in the north, the group auditioned for drummers at the Point Studio in [[Victoria, London]]. [[Andrew Edge]] joined them on drums for 18 months, and went on to join [[Savage Progress]], who later toured with the Thompson Twins as the support act on the band's 1984 UK tour.

In 1980, the band (now consisting of Bailey, Dodd, Roog and drummer Chris Bell, who had replaced Edge the previous year) released their first single, "Squares and Triangles", on their own Dirty Discs label. A follow-up single, "She's In Love With Mystery", was issued later that year.

===Line-up changes===
In 1981, the line-up became Bailey, Dodd, Roog, Bell and two new members: former band roadie [[Joe Leeway]] on congas and percussion, and Jane Shorter on saxophone. This line-up recorded the first Thompson Twins album ''[[A Product of ... (Participation)]]'', documented in the film ''Listen to London'' (1981).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.listentolondon.net |title=The "Lost" Listen To London Documentary! – 1981 Film about Post Punk Indy Rebellion in UK |website=Listentolondon.net |access-date=31 January 2014}}</ref> Currie, who had been associated with the band for a few years, played and sang on the first album, but was not yet a full member.

After the first album, the band's line-up shifted yet again. Saxophonist Jane Shorter left and was replaced by Currie (who also played percussion), and bassist [[Matthew Seligman]], a former member of [[the Soft Boys]] and [[the Fallout Club]], joined;<ref name="AMG"/> leaving Bailey to switch to keyboards, with Leeway starting to handle vocals on some tracks.

The band signed to [[Arista Records]] and released the album ''[[Set (Thompson Twins album)|Set]]''.<ref name="AMG"/> [[Thomas Dolby]] played some keyboards on ''Set'' and some live gigs, for Bailey at that time had little experience with synthesizers. ''Set'' contained the single "[[In the Name of Love (Thompson Twins song)|In the Name of Love]]", sung and largely written by Bailey. It became a No.&nbsp;1 dance club hit in the US,<ref name="Charts">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/thompson-twins-mn0000567570/awards |title=Thompson Twins &#124; Awards |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=31 January 2014}}</ref> and an album entitled ''In the Name of Love'' (consisting mainly of tracks from ''Set'', with two others from ''A Product Of... (Participation)'') was released in the US to capitalize on the song's popularity. It entered the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name="Charts"/>

===Trio===
After the success of "In the Name of Love", Bailey, Currie and Leeway, wanting to pursue the single's different sound, toyed with the idea of starting a new band on the side, which they planned to call 'The Bermuda Triangle'.<ref name="Lost">{{cite web|url=http://www.lostidols.com/files/t/twins.html |title=Lost Idols |website=Lostidols.com |access-date=31 January 2014}}</ref> When "In The Name Of Love" (and the parent album ''Set'') failed to make a substantial impact in the UK [[record chart]]s, this plan was abandoned. However, at the same time, manager Hade convinced Bailey, Leeway and Currie to downsize the Thompson Twins to a core of the three in April 1982.<ref name="Lost"/> Accordingly, the other four members of the band were notified that the band was breaking up; they were each paid £500 and were allowed to keep their instruments and equipment in exchange for an understanding not to perform together under the name "Thompson Twins".

The remaining Thompson Twins, who had not in fact "broken up", decided to go abroad to free themselves of any UK influence, as well as to combine the songwriting for their first album as a trio with a long holiday. They first went to [[Egypt]] and then to the [[Bahamas]], where they recorded at [[Compass Point Studios]] in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] with [[record producer|producer]] [[Alex Sadkin]].

Bailey commented on the band's reduction to a trio in a 1983 interview: "When we reformed the band, we were making a statement. We weren't going to be a rock 'n' roll band, we weren't going to have a guitar. We were going to move on. You know, [[Lou Reed]] said whenever he played live he ended up going back to heroin music. There are old associations, associations we don't want because they don't reflect the way we feel today. ... Right now, technology is what's important, and that's what our music tries to reflect."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mehler |first=Mark |title=Either Get into Context or Butt Out of Life Altogether |journal=Record |date=June 1983 |volume=2 |issue=8 |page=6}}</ref>

===International success===
The band broke into the [[UK Singles Chart]] and the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart at the beginning of 1983 with "[[Lies (Thompson Twins song)|Lies]]" and "[[Love On Your Side (song)|Love On Your Side]]", which became the band's first UK Top 10 single.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=David |title=British Hit Singles & Albums |publisher=Guinness World Records Limited |location=London |edition=19th |year=2006 |page=557 |isbn=1-904994-10-5}}</ref><ref name="Charts"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Wallace |first=Gary |title=British Chart Singles: Love On Your Side – Thompson Twins |url=http://britishchartsingles.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/love-on-your-side-thompson-twins.html |website=Britishchartsingles.blogspot.co.uk |date=6 March 2013 |access-date=17 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418234447/http://britishchartsingles.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/love-on-your-side-thompson-twins.html |archive-date=18 April 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> They then released their third album, ''[[Quick Step & Side Kick]]'' (called simply ''Side Kicks'' in the US),<ref name="Charts"/> which peaked at number 2 in the UK and was later certified platinum. Further singles followed with "[[We Are Detective]]" (another Top 10 UK hit) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishchartsingles.com/index.php/2013/05/01/we-are-detective-thompson-twins/ |title=We Are Detective – Thompson Twins |publisher=British Chart Singles |access-date=17 April 2014}}</ref> and "[[Watching (Thompson Twins song)|Watching]]" (UK No. 33).<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> All three band members worked collectively on songwriting with Currie providing lyrics and Bailey melodies. In addition Leeway was responsible for stagecraft, Currie for videos and imagery and Bailey for musicianship and production.<ref name="TheAge">{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/01/10/1073437513674.html|title=Hear Me Now by Gilbert Wong |website=Theage.com.au |access-date=27 October 2009 |location=Melbourne |date=11 January 2004}}</ref> During 1983, the band had the opening spot on [[The Police]]'s concert tour in the US.

"[[Hold Me Now (Thompson Twins song)|Hold Me Now]]" was released in late 1983. The song was an international chart success, peaking at No.&nbsp;4 in their native UK<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishchartsingles.com/index.php/2013/12/04/hold-me-now-thompson-twins/ |title=Hold Me Now – Thompson Twins |publisher=British Chart Singles |access-date=17 April 2014}}</ref> where it became the band's biggest seller earning a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]],<ref>[http://www.bpi.co.uk/platinum/platinumright.asp?rq=search_plat&r_id=20357 ] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> and reached No.&nbsp;3 in the US in the spring of 1984 becoming their biggest American hit.<ref name="Charts"/> The band's new album, ''[[Into the Gap]]'', was released in early 1984 and became one of the year's biggest sellers, selling five million copies worldwide. It topped the [[UK Albums Chart]]<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> and was later certified double platinum there. Further hit singles from the album followed with "[[Doctor! Doctor!]]" (UK No.&nbsp;3)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishchartsingles.com/index.php/2014/02/19/doctor-doctor-thompson-twins/ |title=Doctor Doctor – Thompson Twins |publisher=British Chart Singles |access-date=17 April 2014}}</ref> and "[[You Take Me Up]]" (UK No.&nbsp;2, their highest UK singles chart placing<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> and which earned a [[music recording sales certification|silver disc]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/certified-awards.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315204844/http://www.bpi.co.uk/certified-awards.aspx|url-status=dead|title=BPI database|archive-date=15 March 2015|access-date=15 October 2021}}</ref> Other singles included a new version of the album track "[[Sister of Mercy (Thompson Twins song)|Sister of Mercy]]" (UK No.&nbsp;11), and "[[The Gap (song)|The Gap]]" (though this was not released in the UK). The band embarked on a world tour in support of the album, which had also made the US top ten.

A brand new single, "[[Lay Your Hands on Me (Thompson Twins song)|Lay Your Hands on Me]]", was released in the UK in late 1984 and reached No.&nbsp;13 in the UK chart.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> Following this, the band parted company with their producer [[Alex Sadkin]] and opted to produce their new album, ''[[Here's To Future Days]]'', by themselves in [[Paris]]. However, in March 1985, while promoting their new single "[[Roll Over (Thompson Twins song)|Roll Over]]" and the forthcoming album, Bailey collapsed in his London hotel room from nervous exhaustion. The "Roll Over" single was then cancelled at the last minute and the new album postponed. Though the band had chosen to produce themselves, the postponement caused them to rethink the project and producer [[Nile Rodgers]] was subsequently called in to rework the album with them. The album was eventually released in September 1985, reaching the UK Top 5 and US Top 20,<ref name="Charts"/> though failed to come close to the success of ''Into The Gap''. It was preceded by the single "[[Don't Mess with Doctor Dream|Don't Mess With Doctor Dream]]" (UK No.&nbsp;15)<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> and followed by the single "[[King for a Day (Thompson Twins song)|King For A Day]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;22 in the UK,<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> but reached No.&nbsp;8 on the US chart.<ref name="Charts"/> Other singles included a new US version of "[[Lay Your Hands on Me (Thompson Twins song)|Lay Your Hands On Me]]" (US No.&nbsp;6),<ref name="Charts"/> and a [[Cover version|cover]] of [[the Beatles]]' 1968 hit "[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]", which failed to make the UK Top 40.

Prior to the album's release, the Thompson Twins performed on the American leg of [[Live Aid]] in July 1985 and were joined onstage by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> The planned summer 1985 tour of the UK (and a headlining appearance at the [[Glastonbury Festival]]) had to be cancelled due to Bailey's health problems (fans with tickets received a free live album as compensation), though international dates were rescheduled and the latter half of 1985 saw sell out tours for the band in the US and [[Japan]].<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book |last=Tobler |first=John |title=NME Rock 'N' Roll Years |publisher=Reed International Books Ltd |location=London |edition=1st |year=1992 |page=408 |id=CN 5585}}</ref> A second planned tour of the UK in 1985 was also scrapped due to the promoter declaring bankruptcy.

===Duo===
Leeway left the band in 1986, and the remaining duo of Bailey and Currie carried on making music for another seven years.<ref name="AMG"/> The act's first release as a duo was the North America-only single "[[Nothing in Common (Thompson Twins song)|Nothing In Common]]", issued in July 1986. It peaked at No. 54 in the US, and No. 68 in Canada.

1987 saw the release of ''[[Close to the Bone (Thompson Twins album)|Close to the Bone]]'' and the single "[[Get That Love]]", which climbed to No.&nbsp;31 in the US<ref name="Charts"/> but only reached No.&nbsp;66 in the UK.<ref name="chart">{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/19863/the-thompson-twins/ |title=The Thompson Twins &#124; full Official Chart History &#124; Official Charts Company |website=Officialcharts.com}}</ref> The album itself was a commercial flop. It spent only one week on the UK albums chart at No.&nbsp;90 and yielded no further chart singles.<ref name="chart" /> 

"In the Name of Love" was given a new lease on life in 1988, after a remix by [[Shep Pettibone]] made the Top 50 in the UK.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> 1989 saw the release of another album, ''[[Big Trash]]'', and a new [[recording contract]] with [[Warner Bros. Records]].<ref name="AMG"/> The single "[[Sugar Daddy (Thompson Twins song)|Sugar Daddy]]" peaked at No.&nbsp;28 in the US<ref name="Charts"/> and would be their last brush with mainstream chart success.<ref name="AMG"/> 1991's ''[[Queer (Thompson Twins album)|Queer]]'' would be the band's swansong, and was supported by various [[techno]]-inspired singles under the moniker of [http://www.discogs.com/artist/Feedback+Max Feedback Max] (in the UK) to disguise the identity of the band to [[Nightclub|club]] [[Disc jockey|DJs]]. The single "[[Come Inside (Thompson Twins song)|Come Inside]]" reached No.&nbsp;7 in the US [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Dance Chart]]<ref name="Charts"/> and No.&nbsp;1 in the [[UK Dance Chart]].

Prior to this, Bailey and Currie (who were now a couple) had their first child together in 1988,<ref name="AMG"/> and in the following years they spent a lot of time writing material for other artists including the hit single "[[I Want That Man]]" for [[Debbie Harry]] in 1989.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book |editor=Colin Larkin |editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer) |title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |date=1997 |edition=Concise |page=1176 |isbn=1-85227-745-9}}</ref> In 1990, Bailey and Currie contributed the song "[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (song)|Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?]]" to the [[Cole Porter]] tribute album ''[[Red Hot + Blue]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]. In 1991, Bailey and Currie were married in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] and the following year moved to New Zealand with their two children. In 1992, the Thompson Twins contributed the song "Play With Me" to the [[Songs from the Cool World|soundtrack]] of the [[Ralph Bakshi]] film ''[[Cool World]]''; Bailey alone contributed a second track, "Industry and Seduction". The following year, the duo teamed up with engineer Keith Fernley and changed their band name to [[Babble (band)|Babble]]. They released two albums, in 1993 and 1996.<ref name="AMG"/>

The Thompson Twins declined to follow the example of many of their contemporaries and reform in order to tie in with a trend of nostalgia for the 1980s, although Bailey, Currie and Leeway appeared together on the UK [[Channel 4]] show ''Top Ten Electro Bands'' in 2001. The Thompson Twins were placed ninth.

==After the Twins==
Babble released two albums, ''[[The Stone (album)|The Stone]]'' (1993)<ref name="AMG"/> and ''[[Ether (Babble album)|Ether]]'' (1996), with songs featured in the films ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]'' and ''[[With Honors (film)|With Honors]]''.

In the mid-1990s, Currie gave up the music business to set up her own glass-casting studio in [[Auckland]] and concentrated on raising her two children. In 2001, she founded and ran the anti-GM group called MAdGE (Mothers Against Genetic Engineering in food and the environment), and networked thousands of women across New Zealand in a resistance movement, aimed at keeping the biotech industry from using New Zealand as an experimental playground.<ref name="TheAge"/> Currie described this group as a "rapidly growing network of politically non-aligned women who are actively resisting the use of genetically-engineered material in our food and on our land". During that time she designed a billboard to spark a debate on the ethics of genetically modifying cows with human genes to produce a new milk.<ref>[http://www.investigatemagazine.com/jan3ge.htm/ Alannah Currie: Anti-GM Queen] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303174732/http://www.investigatemagazine.com/jan3ge.htm |date=3 March 2016}}, ''Investigate'' magazine, January 2003.</ref> The billboard, featuring a young woman with four breasts hooked up to a milking machine, caused huge controversy but won several international art awards.<ref>[http://www.usfcam.usf.edu/CAM/exhibitions/2004_01_DNA/DNAonline/index.html DNA: Art & Science / Double Helix], USF Contemporary Art Museum, 2004.</ref><ref>[https://www.cabi.org/agbiotechnet/news/3191 NZ 'Milked Woman' Billboard Campaign], Cabi.org, October 2003.</ref> Bailey and Currie divorced in 2003, and both left New Zealand to live separately in the UK.

After leaving the Thompson Twins in 1986, Leeway briefly dabbled in acting and attempted a solo music career, though neither were successful. {{As of|2006}}, he resides in [[Los Angeles]], and works in the field of [[hypnotherapy]]. He is on the staff at the Hypnosis Motivation Institute (HMI) in the Los Angeles district of [[Tarzana, Los Angeles|Tarzana]], and is also a certified trainer in [[neuro-linguistic programming]].
