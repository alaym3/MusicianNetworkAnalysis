'''Hypocrisy''' is the practice of engaging in the same behavior or activity for which one criticizes another or the practice of claiming to have moral standards or beliefs to which one's own behavior does not conform. In [[moral psychology]], it is the failure to follow one's own expressed moral rules and principles.<ref name="lammers infidelity 2011">{{cite journal |last1=Lammers |first1=Joris |first2=Janka I. |last2=Stoker |first3=Jennifer |last3=Jordan |first4=Monique |last4=Pollmann |first5=Diederik A. |last5=Stapel |date=July 2011 |title=Power increases infidelity among men and women |journal=Psychological Science |volume=22 |issue=9 |pages=1191–1197 |doi=10.1177/0956797611416252 |pmid=21771963 |s2cid=11385458 |url=http://leeds-faculty.colorado.edu/mcgrawp/PDF/Lammers.Stoker.Jordan.Pollmann.Stapel.2011.pdf}}</ref> According to British political philosopher [[David Runciman]], "Other kinds of hypocritical deception include claims to knowledge that one lacks, claims to a consistency that one cannot sustain, claims to a loyalty that one does not possess, claims to an identity that one does not hold".<ref>{{cite book|last=Runciman |first=David |author-link=David Runciman |title=Political Hypocrisy: The Mask of Power, from Hobbes to Orwell and Beyond |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vqaPj0SbXsoC&pg=PA8 |year=2010 |publisher=Princeton UP |page=8 |isbn=978-0691148151}}</ref> American political journalist [[Michael Gerson]] says that political hypocrisy is "the conscious use of a mask to fool the public and gain political benefit".<ref name="Gerson Trump">{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Gerson |title=Trump's hypocrisy is good for America |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trumps-hypocrisy-is-good-for-america/2016/11/28/7cde5d42-b5a3-11e6-b8df-600bd9d38a02_story.html |newspaper=Washington Post |date=29 November 2016}}</ref>

Hypocrisy has been a subject of [[folk wisdom]] and [[wisdom literature]] from the beginnings of human history. Increasingly, since the 1980s, it has also become central to studies in [[behavioral economics]], [[cognitive science]], [[cultural psychology]], [[Decision-making|decision making]], [[ethics]], [[evolutionary psychology]], moral psychology, [[political sociology]], [[positive psychology]], [[social psychology]], and [[social psychology (sociology)|sociological social psychology]].

==Etymology==

The word ''hypocrisy'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ὑπόκρισις (''hypokrisis''), which means "jealous", "play-acting", "acting out", "coward" or "dissembling".<ref>Pocket Oxford Classical Greek Dictionary, ed Morwood and Taylor, OUP 2002</ref> The word ''hypocrite'' is from the Greek word ὑποκριτής (''hypokritēs''), the [[agent noun|agentive noun]] associated with ὑποκρίνομαι (hypokrinomai κρίση, "judgment" »κριτική (kritikē), "critics") presumably because the performance of a dramatic text by an actor was to involve a degree of interpretation, or assessment.

Alternatively, the word is an amalgam of the Greek prefix ''hypo-'', meaning "under", and the verb ''krinein'', meaning "to sift or decide". Thus the original meaning implied a deficiency in the ability to sift or decide. This deficiency, as it pertains to one's own beliefs and feelings, informs the word's contemporary meaning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hypocrisy |title=Online Etymology Dictionary: "hypocrisy" |publisher=Etymonline.com |access-date=2013-03-28}}</ref>

Whereas ''hypokrisis'' applied to any sort of public performance (including the art of rhetoric), ''hypokrites'' was a technical term for a stage actor and was not considered an appropriate role for a public figure.  In Athens during the 4th century BC, for example, the great orator [[Demosthenes]] ridiculed his rival [[Aeschines]], who had been a successful actor before taking up politics, as a ''hypocrites'' whose skill at impersonating characters on stage made him an untrustworthy politician. This negative view of the ''hypokrites,'' perhaps combined with the Roman disdain for actors, later shaded into the originally neutral ''hypokrisis.''  It is this later sense of ''hypokrisis'' as "play-acting", i.e., the assumption of a counterfeit persona, that gives the modern word ''hypocrisy'' its negative connotation.

==History==
Hypocrisy became a major topic in English political history in the early 18th century. The [[Toleration Act 1689|Toleration Act of 1689]] allowed for certain rights, but it left Protestant [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]]s (such as [[Congregationalists]] and [[Baptists]]) deprived of important rights, including that of office-holding. Nonconformists who wanted office ostentatiously took the Anglican [[sacrament]] once a year in order to avoid the restrictions. [[High Church Anglicanism|High Church Anglicans]] were outraged and outlawed what they called "occasional conformity" in 1711 with the [[Occasional Conformity Act 1711]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Jones Clyve | year = 2011 | title = 'Too Wild to Succeed': The Occasional Conformity Bills and the Attempts by the House of Lords to Outlaw the Tack in the Reign of Anne | journal = Parliamentary History | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 414–27 | doi=10.1111/j.1750-0206.2011.00276.x}}</ref> In the political controversies using sermons, speeches, and pamphlet wars, both high churchmen and Nonconformists attacked their opponents as insincere and hypocritical, as well as dangerously zealous, in contrast to their own moderation.

In his famous book ''[[The Fable of the Bees|Fable of the Bees]]'' (1714) English author [[Bernard Mandeville]] ( 1670–1733) explored the nature of hypocrisy in contemporary European society. On the one hand Mandeville was a ‘moralist’ heir to the French [[Augustinianism]] of the previous century, viewing sociability as a mere mask for vanity and pride. On the other he was a ‘materialist’ who helped found modern economics. He tried to demonstrate the universality of human appetites for corporeal pleasures. He argued that the efforts of self-seeking entrepreneurs are the basis of emerging commercial and industrial society, a line of thought that influenced [[Adam Smith]] (1723–1790) and 19th century [[utilitarianism]]. The tension between these two approaches modes ambivalences and contradictions—concerning the relative power of norms and interests, the relationship between motives and behaviours, and the historical variability of human cultures.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Luban Daniel | year = 2015 | title = Bernard Mandeville as Moralist and Materialist | url = https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:beb92369-f940-4053-935e-0e2eaf50936a| journal = History of European Ideas | volume = 41 | issue = 7| pages = 831–57 | doi=10.1080/01916599.2015.1010777| s2cid = 145179618 }}</ref>  In the Enlightenment of the 18th century, discussions of hypocrisy were common in the works of [[Voltaire]], [[Rousseau]], and [[Montaigne]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Miller James | year = 2014 | title = Rousseau and Montaigne | journal = Raritan | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 158–66 }}</ref>

In the 1750 to 1850 era, Whig aristocrats in England boasted of their special benevolence for the common people. They claimed to be guiding and counseling reform initiatives to prevent the outbreaks of popular discontent that caused instability and revolution across Europe. However Tory and radical critics accused the Whigs of hypocrisy—alleging they were deliberately using the slogans of reform and democracy to boost themselves into power while preserving their precious aristocratic exclusiveness.

Meanwhile, a steady stream of observers from the Continent commented on the English political culture. Liberal and radical observers noted the servility of the English lower classes, the obsession everyone had with rank and title, the extravagance of the [[aristocracy]], a supposed [[anti-intellectualism]], and a pervasive hypocrisy that extended into such areas as social reform. 

===United States===
In the propaganda battles of [[World War II]], Japan attacked American hypocrisy by emphasizing the injustice of the [[Internment of Japanese Americans|incarceration camps for Japanese]] in the United States. [[Radio Tokyo]] emphasized that the camps revealed the hypocritical American claim to democratic ideals and fair play. The [[propaganda]] quoted American founding fathers, neutral sources, and dissenting opinions from major American newspapers. Radio Tokyo utilized fictitious sources as well. It proclaimed the moral superiority of Japan while threatening to mistreat American POWs in retaliation.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Mizuno Takeya | year = 2013 | title = An Enemy's Talk of 'Justice' | journal = Journalism History | volume = 39 | issue = 2| page = 94 | doi = 10.1080/00947679.2013.12062905 | s2cid = 142108853 }}</ref>

American historian [[Martin Jay]] in ''The Virtues of Mendacity: On Lying in Politics'' (2012) explores how writers over the centuries have treated hypocrisy, deception, flattery, lying and cheating, slander, false pretenses, living on borrowed glory, masquerading, conventions of concealment, playacting before others and the arts of dissimulation.  He assumes that politics is worthwhile, but since it is unavoidably linked to lying and hypocrisy, Jay concludes that lying must not be all that bad.<ref>Jay, Martin (2012).

==Moral and religious codes==
Many belief systems condemn hypocrisy.<ref>Thomas P. Kasulis, "Hypocrisy in the Self-Understanding of Religions." in ''Inter-Religious Models and Criteria'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 1993) pp. 151–65.</ref>

In [[Islam]], [[Quranic Chapter 63]] is often titled "[[ Quranic Chapter 63|The Hypocrites]]" Hypocrisy is viewed as a serious sickness.<ref>{{cite book|author=Christine Huda Dodge|title=The Everything Understanding Islam Book: A complete guide to Muslim beliefs, practices, and culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hd5vHqdvp5kC&pg=PT96|date= 2009|page=96|isbn=9781605507248}}</ref> The [[Qur'an]] rails against those who claim to be believers and [[peacemakers]], thinking they are fooling [[God]] and others, but only fool themselves.<ref name="quran">"And of mankind are some who say, 'We believe in God and the Last Day,' when they believe not. They think to beguile God and those who believe, and they beguile none save themselves; but they perceive not. In their hearts is a disease, and God increases their disease. A painful doom is theirs because they lie. And when it is said to them, 'Make not mischief on the earth,' they say, 'We are only peacemakers.' Behold they are indeed the mischief-makers but they perceive not." [[Al-Baqara]] 8–12</ref>

In some translations of the [[Book of Job]], the [[Hebrew]] word ''chaneph'' is rendered as "hypocrite", though it usually means "godless" or "profane". In the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Bible]], [[Jesus]] condemns the scribes and [[Pharisees]] as hypocrites in the passage known as the [[Woes of the Pharisees]].<ref name="woes">[[Gospel of Luke]] {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|11:37–54}} and [[Gospel of Matthew]] {{bibleverse-nb||Matt|23:1–36}}</ref><ref>Steve Mason, "Pharisaic Dominance Before 70 CE and the Gospels' Hypocrisy Charge (Matt 23: 2–3)." ''Harvard Theological Review'' 83#4 (1990): 363–81.</ref>
He also denounces hypocrites in more general terms in [[Matthew 7:5]].

In the 16th century, John Calvin was critical of [[Nicodemite]]s.

In the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] text [[Dhammapada]], [[Gautama Buddha]] condemns a man who takes the appearance of an ascetic but is full of passions within.<ref name="Dhammapada">"What is the use of platted hair, O fool! what of the raiment of goat-skins? Within thee there is ravening, but the outside thou makest clean. The man who wears dirty raiments, who is emaciated and covered with veins, who lives alone in the forest, and meditates, him I call indeed a Brâhmana. I do not call a man a Brâhmana because of his origin or of his mother. He is indeed arrogant, and he is wealthy: but the poor, who is free from all attachments, him I call indeed a Brâhmana. [[Dhammapada]] 394–96, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1028.htm Translated from the Pâli] by F. Max Müller</ref>

==Psychology==

Hypocrisy has long been of interest to [[psychologist]]s.

===Carl Jung===
In Switzerland [[Carl Jung]] (1875–1961) attributed hypocrisy to those who are not aware of the dark or [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow-side]] of their nature. Jung wrote: 
:Every individual needs revolution, inner division, overthrow of the existing order, and renewal, but not by forcing them upon his neighbors under the hypocritical cloak of Christian love or the sense of social responsibility or any of the other beautiful euphemisms for unconscious urges to personal power.{{sfn|Jung|1966|p=5}}

Jung went on:{{sfn|Jung|1966|loc=par. 28}}
<blockquote>It is under all circumstances an advantage to be in full possession of one's personality, otherwise the repressed elements will only crop up as a hindrance elsewhere, not just at some unimportant point, but at the very spot where we are most sensitive. If people can be educated to see the shadow-side of their nature clearly, it may be hoped that they will also learn to understand and love their fellow men better. A little less hypocrisy and a little more [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]] can only have good results in respect for our neighbor; for we are all too prone to transfer to our fellows the injustice and violence we inflict upon our own natures.</blockquote>

In ''New Paths in Psychology'' Jung pointedly referred to the "hypocritical pretenses of man". "[[Dream analysis|Dream-analysis]] above all else mercilessly uncovers the lying morality and hypocritical pretences of man, showing him, for once, the other side of his character in the most vivid light".{{sfn|Jung|1966|loc=par. 437}} Jung omitted this characterization from his later essay ''On the Psychology of the Unconscious'', which developed out of the former.

Humans take a position, look for evidence that supports it, then, if they find ''some'' evidence – enough so that the position "makes sense" – they stop thinking altogether (the "makes-sense stopping rule").<ref>{{cite book |last1=Perkins |first1=D.

Moreover, humans tend to think highly of themselves, highlighting strengths and achievements, and overlooking weakness and failures (the "[[self-serving bias]]").

==Social psychology==

Social psychologists have generally viewed hypocrisy as an instantiation of attitudinal and/or behavioral inconsistency.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Alicke |first1=Mark D. |last2=Gordon |first2=Ellen |last3=Rose |first3=David |date=October 2013 |title=Hypocrisy: What counts? |journal=Philosophical Psychology |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=673–701 |doi=10.1080/09515089.2012.677397 |s2cid=146164276}}</ref> Accordingly, many social psychologists have focused on the role of dissonance in explaining individuals' aversion to hypocritical thinking and behavior.<ref>Fried, C. B. (1998). "Hypocrisy and Identification With Transgressions: A Case of Undetected Dissonance", 'Basic and Applied Social Psychology', 20(2), 145–154.</ref> Individuals are motivated to avoid hypocritical stances in order to forestall the negative drive state of dissonance. For example, a dissonance-based study on the use of condoms among young adults showed that induced hypocrisy can lead to increased purchase and use of condoms.<ref>Stone, J., E. Aronson, A. L. Crain, M. P. Winslow, & C. B. Fried (1994). "Inducing Hypocrisy as a Means of Encouraging Young Adults to Use Condoms, 'Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin', 20(1), 116–128.</ref>

Alternatively, some social psychologists have suggested that individuals view hypocrisy negatively because it suggests that hypocrites are providing a false signal regarding their moral goodness.<ref>J. J. Jordan, R. Sommers, P. Bloom, & D. G. Rand (2017). "Why Do We Hate Hypocrites? Evidence for a Theory of False Signaling", 'Psychological Science' (28(3), 356–368.</ref>

==Philosophy==

Hypocrisy has been an intermittent topic of interest to philosophers since at least Machiavelli. Philosophical issues raised by hypocrisy can be broadly divided into two kinds: metaphysical/conceptual and ethical. Most philosophical commentary on hypocrisy is concerned with the ethical questions it raises: is hypocrisy morally wrong or bad? If it is, is there anything distinctly objectionable about it, or can it be easily subsumed under a broader category of morally objectionable conduct–for example, deceit? Is hypocrisy necessary or desirable for the sake of certain valuable activities–most notably, politics? <ref>{{cite journal| author = Daryl Glaser| year = 2006 | title = Does Hypocrisy Matter? The Case of U.S. Foreign Policy | journal = Review of International Studies | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 251–268|doi=10.1017/S0260210506007017| doi-access = free}}</ref>

Recently, hypocrisy has emerged as a key focus in philosophical discussions of the ethics of blame. It seems that even if a person has violated some moral norm and is genuinely blameworthy for doing so, it is open to them to challenge the blame leveled at them on the grounds that it is hypocritical; a typical expression of this idea is the phrase, "You have no right to blame me!" Accordingly, some philosophers argue that in order to have the standing or entitlement to blame others, one's blame must not be hypocritical. Defenses of this position have usually focused on the connection between hypocrisy and fairness: the basic idea is that the hypocritical blamer in some way fails to treat the target of her blame as a moral equal.<ref>{{cite journal |first=R. Jay |last=Wallace |date=Fall 2010 |title=Hypocrisy, Moral Address, and the Equal Standing of Persons |journal=Philosophy & Public Affairs |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=307–341 |jstor=40926873 |doi=10.1111/j.1088-4963.2010.01195.x}}</ref> Other proposed explanations include the idea that standing in a moral community requires a reciprocal willingness to accept blame, a willingness that hypocrites lack.<ref>{{cite journal| author = R.A.

Duff suggests that underlying the disagreement between these two views is a disagreement about the size and scope of moral community, while Kyle Fritz and Daniel Miller suggest that the rejection of the "No-hypocrisy" condition reflects a failure to distinguish between the right to blame and the value of blaming.

The definition of hypocrisy itself is the fundamental question of the relatively new philosophical discussions on hypocrisy. Early answers tended to focus on the deceptive or inconsistent qualities of hypocrisy. For [[Eva Kittay]], for example, the fundamental attribute of hypocrites is "self-referential deception,"<ref>{{cite journal| author = Eva Feder Kittay | year = 1982 | title = On Hypocrisy | journal = Metaphilosophy | volume = 13 | issue = 3 & 4| pages = 277–289 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9973.1982.tb00685.x| jstor = 24435495 }}</ref> and for [[Gilbert Ryle]], to be hypocritical is to "try to appear activated by a motive other than one's real motive."<ref>Ryle, Gilbert. ''The Concept of Mind''. London: Hutchinson 1949, 173.</ref> On Dan Turner's view, by contrast, the fundamental feature is "conflict or disparity" between a person's attitudes, where this may or may not involve deception.<ref>{{cite journal| author = Dan Turner | year = 1990 | title = Hypocrisy | journal = Metaphilosophy | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 262–269 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9973.1990.tb00528.x}}</ref> Bela Szabados and Daniel Statman argue that self-deception is the characteristic attribute of "garden variety of hypocrisies."<ref>{{cite journal| author = Bela Szabados | year = 1979 | title = Hypocrisy | journal = Canadian Journal of Philosophy | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 195–210 | jstor = 40231090 | doi = 10.1080/00455091.1979.10716245 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| author = Daniel Statman | year = 1997 | title = Hypocrisy and Self-Deception| journal = Philosophical Psychology| volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 57–75 | doi=10.1080/09515089708573204}}</ref> Roger Crisp and Christopher Cowten identify four types of hypocrisy: pretense of moral goodness, moral criticism of others by those possessing faults of their own, failure to satisfy self-acknowledged moral requirements, and a complacent, unreflective commitment to virtues feigned or preached. What unifies these types is a "metavice," a lack of "moral seriousness."<ref>{{cite journal| author = Roger Crisp and Christopher Cowten | year = 1994 | title = Hypocrisy and Moral Seriousness| journal = American Philosophical Quarterly| volume = 31 | issue = 4| pages = 343–349 | jstor = 20009796 }}</ref> More recently, some philosophers–notably, Benjamin Rossi and Fritz and Miller–have defined hypocrisy in terms of dispositions to blame others or to avow commitment to certain norms together with an unwillingness to accept blame from others or to blame themselves.<ref>{{cite journal| author = Kyle Fritz and Daniel Miller | year = 2015 | title = Hypocrisy and the Standing to Blame| journal = Pacific Philosophical Quarterly| volume = 99 | issue = 1| pages = 118–139 |doi=10.1111/papq.12104| url = https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/ }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| author = Benjamin Rossi | year = 2018 | title = The Commitment Account of Hypocrisy| journal = Ethical Theory and Moral Practice| volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages =553–536 |doi=10.1007/s10677-018-9917-3| s2cid = 150162902 }}</ref> Rossi's "Commitment Account of Hypocrisy" addresses paradigmatic cases of hypocrisy that Fritz and Miller's "Differential Blaming Disposition Account" does not include.

==Benefits==
Although there are many negatives to hypocrisy, there can be benefits from it as well.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tillyris |first=Demetris |year=2016 |title=The virtue of vice: a defence of hypocrisy in democratic politics |url=https://repository.canterbury.ac.uk/item/87xvy/the-virtue-of-vice-a-defence-of-hypocrisy-in-democratic-politics |journal=Contemporary Politics |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=1–19 |doi=10.1080/13569775.2015.1112958 |s2cid=146732349 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180720035535/http://create.canterbury.ac.uk/14938/1/14938.pdf |archive-date=20 July 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> There are also benefits from ignoring it. Political theorist [[Judith N. Shklar]]  argues, in "Let Us Not Be Hypocritical," we are all too eager to construe even minor deviations from our opponents' professed beliefs as hypocrisy, rather than understandable imperfections and weaknesses to which everyone is prone.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Koppang Haavard, Martin Mike W | year = 2004 | title = On Moralizing in Business Ethics | journal = Business & Professional Ethics Journal | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 107–14 | doi=10.5840/bpej200423319}}</ref><ref>Judith Shklar, "Let us not be hypocritical." ''Daedalus'' (1979): 1–25. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20024618 in JSTOR]</ref>

Political journalist Michael Gerson notes that, "There is often hypocritical deception involved in political and diplomatic negotiations, which generally start with principled, nonnegotiable demands that are negotiated away in the process of finding a compromise." Gerson concludes:<ref name="Gerson Trump"/>
<blockquote>hypocrisy is unavoidable and necessary. If people were required, at all times, to live up to ideals of honesty, loyalty and compassion in order for those ideals to exist, there would be no ideals. Being a moral person is a struggle in which everyone repeatedly fails, becoming a hypocrite in each of those moments. A just and peaceful society depends on hypocrites who ultimately refused to abandon the ideals they betray.</blockquote>
