'''The Hold Steady''' is an American rock band originally from [[Minneapolis]], Minnesota, now based in [[Brooklyn]], New York, formed in 2003. The band consists of [[Craig Finn]] (vocals, guitar), [[Tad Kubler]] (guitar), Galen Polivka (bass), Bobby Drake (drums), [[Franz Nicolay]] (keyboards) and [[Steve Selvidge]] (guitar).<ref name="blogs.riverfronttimes.com">{{cite web |last=Dauphin |first=Michael |url=http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/rftmusic/2011/08/loufest_hold_steady_craig_finn_interview.php |title=LouFest Interviews: Craig Finn of the Hold Steady |publisher=Blogs.riverfronttimes.com |date=August 23, 2011 |access-date=February 11, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203034425/http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/rftmusic/2011/08/loufest_hold_steady_craig_finn_interview.php |archive-date=December 3, 2013 }}</ref> Noted for their "lyrically dense storytelling,"<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6724051 | title= The Hold Steady: America's Bar Band | last= Dye | first= David | publisher= NPR Music}}</ref> and [[classic rock]] influences, the band's narrative-based songs frequently address themes such as [[drug addiction]], religion and [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]], and often feature recurring characters based within the city of [[Minneapolis]].

Formed four years following the break-up of Finn and Kubler's former band, [[Lifter Puller]], The Hold Steady released the debut album ''[[Almost Killed Me]]'' in 2004. They came to prominence with the release of their third studio album, ''[[Boys and Girls in America]]'', in 2006. In 2010, keyboardist and multi-instrumentalist [[Franz Nicolay]] left the band prior to the recording of their fifth studio album, ''[[Heaven Is Whenever]]'' (2010). During the band's subsequent tour, the band became a five piece, once more, with the addition of guitarist [[Steve Selvidge]].<ref name="blogs.riverfronttimes.com"/> The band released their sixth LP, ''[[Teeth Dreams]]'', on March 25, 2014.

Nicolay re-joined the band on May 4, 2016, and the band has since embarked on several concert residencies in the US and the UK. To coincide with each event, The Hold Steady released stand-alone singles, marking the first recorded material of the six-piece line-up. Working with producer [[Josh Kaufman]], the band released their seventh album, ''[[Thrashing Thru the Passion]]'', in 2019, followed by ''[[Open Door Policy (album)|Open Door Policy]]'' in 2021.

==History==
In 2003, Minnesota-raised singer, writer, and guitarist [[Craig Finn]] and New York City bartender and bassist Galen Polivka began talking about starting a band. Finn and lead guitarist Tad Kubler (both formerly of [[Lifter Puller]]) developed the idea of The Hold Steady when, while watching [[The Band]] concert film ''[[The Last Waltz]]'', Finn asked Kubler, "Dude, why aren't there any bands like this anymore?"<ref>{{cite web | url= http://media.www.dailycollegian.com/media/storage/paper874/news/2007/01/29/ArtsLiving/Hold-Steady.Returns.Hope.To.Rocknroll-2675473.shtml?sourcedomain=www.dailycollegian.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com | last= Master | first= Dave | title= Hold Steady returns hope to rock'n'roll : Daily Collegian exclusive interview with Craig Finn | publisher= The Daily Collegian | url-status= dead | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930185836/http://media.www.dailycollegian.com/media/storage/paper874/news/2007/01/29/ArtsLiving/Hold-Steady.Returns.Hope.To.Rocknroll-2675473.shtml?sourcedomain=www.dailycollegian.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com | archive-date= September 30, 2007 }}</ref> The Hold Steady's 2004 debut album ''[[Almost Killed Me]]'', released on [[Frenchkiss Records]], was a [[sleeper hit]] among music critics, reaching No.&nbsp;31 in the ''[[Pazz & Jop]]'' critics poll that year, an achievement which Finn described as "like being nominated for an Oscar or something."<ref name=villagevoice/> In May 2005, they were the first rock band to grace the front page of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' in 15 years.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} They were ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'''s 2006 "Band of the Year".

The band released its second album, ''[[Separation Sunday]]'', on May 3, 2005. The album was a loose [[concept album]] following the exploits of a character named "Holly" (short for "Hallelujah") and her quest to find a balance between [[Catholicism]] and [[rock and roll]] through drugs and a metaphorical resurrection. The album was critically lauded, and its religious overtones were picked up by many critics, such as Joe Gross of the ''[[Village Voice]]'', who dubbed it "the most egregiously American [[Catholic]] album since [[X (U.S. band)|X]]'s ''[[Under the Big Black Sun]]'', [[Bruce Springsteen|Springsteen]]'s ''[[Tunnel of Love (album)|Tunnel of Love]]'', or that Jewish new waver [[Billy Joel]]'s ''[[The Stranger (album)|The Stranger]]''."<ref name=villagevoice>{{cite web | url= https://www.villagevoice.com/2005/04/26/the-gospel-according-to-the-hold-steady/ | last= Gross | first= Joe | title= The Gospel According to the Hold Steady | publisher= Village Voice}}</ref>

===''Boys and Girls in America'' (2006–2007)===
After ''[[Separation Sunday]]'', the band moved from the [[Frenchkiss Records]] imprint to [[Vagrant Records]]. Released October 3, 2006, ''[[Boys and Girls in America]]'' was ranked No.&nbsp;8 on the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' Best Albums of 2006 list, and first by [[The A.V. Club]]. [[Pitchfork Media]]'s Scott Plagenhoff wrote of the album, "<nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Craig Finn]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> not only has a commanding, rousing voice but he also says something worth hearing, displaying gifts for both scope and depth that are all too rare in contemporary rock&nbsp;— indie or mainstream."<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/38888/The_Hold_Steady_Boys_and_Girls_in_America | last= Plagenhoef | first= Scott | title= The Hold Steady: ''Boys and Girls in America'' review | publisher= Pitchfork Media | url-status= dead | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061031090314/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/38888/The_Hold_Steady_Boys_and_Girls_in_America | archive-date= October 31, 2006 }}</ref> In 2006, they released a music video for "Chips Ahoy", directed by Moh Azima and starring Avital Ash.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOFeaedv3Uc |title=The Hold Steady - "Chips Ahoy!" &#91;Official Video&#93; |publisher=YouTube |access-date=September 17, 2012}}</ref> In 2007, the band recorded a modified version of "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" to be played during the [[seventh-inning stretch]] at [[Minnesota Twins]] home games.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1556150/20070402/hold_steady.jhtml | title= Hold Steady Pinch-Hitting For Minnesota Twins | last= Montgomery | first= James| publisher= MTV News}}</ref> They also contributed a cover of the [[Bob Dylan]] and [[The Hawks (band)|The Hawks]]/[[The Band]] song ''[[Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?]]'' to the motion picture ''[[I'm Not There]]''.

===''Stay Positive'' (2008–2009)===
The band's fourth album, ''[[Stay Positive (album)|Stay Positive]]'', was released in the UK on July 14, 2008, and in the U.S. on July 15. The album was recorded in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] and Wild Arctic studio in [[Queens]], New York with producer John Agnello during January and February that year. Guests on the sessions included Ben Nichols from [[Lucero (band)|Lucero]], [[J. Mascis]] of [[Dinosaur Jr.]], [[Emilyn Brodsky]], and [[Doug Gillard]], who played guitar in [[Guided By Voices]]. Finn has said that he believes the album "captures a band hitting their creative peak, as well as enjoying each other's creativity and company."<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.uncut.co.uk/news/uncut/news/11473 | title= The Hold Steady Prepare to Stay Positive | work= Uncut Magazine}}</ref> The album is more expansive than previous releases, including [[talk-box]] solos, [[harpsichord]], and tuneful vocals (the notoriously gruff-voiced Finn started taking voice lessons). "There are some bands that do five records that all sound similar," says guitarist Tad Kubler. "We've tried to avoid that."<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/19830818/page/52 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080409202744/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/19830818/page/52 | url-status= dead | archive-date= April 9, 2008 | title= Spring '08; LPs From Madonna, Coldplay, The Roots, Mudcrutch, Elvis Costello, Usher, Death Cab For Cutie, My Morning Jacket, Weezer and Dozens More | work= Rolling Stone}}</ref> Many familiar elements&nbsp;– sing-along choruses, extended piano and guitar solos and lyrics that deal with faith, crime, rumor, loss and love&nbsp;– remain.

In April 2009, the band released a two-disc documentary and live album set entitled ''[[A Positive Rage]]''.<ref>[http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/148883-the-hold-steady-release-documentary-live-album] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205155503/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/148883-the-hold-steady-release-documentary-live-album|date=February 5, 2009}}</ref>

===Nicolay's departure, ''Heaven Is Whenever'' and the addition of Selvidge (2010–2011)===
On January 20, 2010, [[Franz Nicolay]] confirmed on his official website that he had left the band.<ref>[http://www.franznicolay.com]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122194153/http://www.franznicolay.com/|date=January 22, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/37645-franz-nicolay-leaves-the-hold-steady/ |title=Franz Nicolay Leaves the Hold Steady &#124; News |publisher=Pitchfork |date=January 21, 2010 |access-date=February 11, 2014}}</ref> Regarding his departure, vocalist and guitarist [[Craig Finn]] stated: "Franz is a real ambitious guy, and I think he wanted to do a lot of different things, and we want to really follow this one Hold Steady thing to its logical end. And it takes up a lot of time. It was an amicable departure, and I think we all wish him the best. He’ll do a lot of interesting, cool things."<ref>{{cite web|last=Warner |first=Denise |url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2010/03/19/craig-finn-hold-steady-heaven-is-whenever-sxsw/ |title=Craig Finn of the Hold Steady talks new album, 'Heaven is Whenever,' at SXSW &#124; The Music Mix &#124; EW.com |publisher=Music-mix.ew.com |date=March 19, 2010 |access-date=February 11, 2014}}</ref>

Nicolay had said that he considered his work with the Hold Steady to be completed, saying "I’m proud of the work we did together. In the end, I felt I completed the work I needed to do with them. I’d prefer to think of it as a closed book."<ref>[http://www.buzzlegoose.com/music/interview-franz-nicolay/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708105743/http://www.buzzlegoose.com/music/interview-franz-nicolay/|date=July 8, 2011}}</ref>

The Hold Steady announced the release of ''[[Heaven Is Whenever]]'' on February 23, 2010. The album was released May 4 on Vagrant Records in the U.S. and May 3 on Rough Trade in Europe.<ref>[http://www.buzzgrinder.com/2010/hold-steady-heave-is-whenever-new-album-may-4/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308120501/http://www.buzzgrinder.com/2010/hold-steady-heave-is-whenever-new-album-may-4/|date=March 8, 2010}}</ref>

The band's subsequent tour featured additional musicians Steve Selvidge, formerly of [[Big Ass Truck]] and [[Lucero (band)|Lucero]], on guitar and Dan Neustadt, of [https://web.archive.org/web/20100330052402/http://www.incadeo.com/ In Cadeo] and [[The World/Inferno Friendship Society]]. Neustadt had previously played keyboards on ''Heaven is Whenever'',<ref>[http://www.theweekender.com/music/You_can_still_rock_in_America_04-02-2010.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515130715/http://www.theweekender.com/music/You_can_still_rock_in_America_04-02-2010.html|date=May 15, 2010}}</ref> but eventually left the touring band by 2011.

In 2011, Selvidge was added to the band's official line-up, with Craig Finn stating, "We added [Steve Selvidge], we are a five piece. We are rolling without keys right now. We did some shows without keys and we really liked it. It sort of opened things up for us. We have two pretty amazing guitar players in our band, and it's really fun to have that space and spread out. They can sort of work against each other/with each other. Steve's been a great addition to the band. We came across Steve many years ago and we always kind of said, 'Man, if things open up and we can get him in the band, we want him.' [...] Steve, lives in Memphis. So wherever we record this time, someone's not going to be at home."<ref name="blogs.riverfronttimes.com"/>

In July 2011, during a five-month break from the band, Craig Finn recorded a solo album, entitled ''[[Clear Heart Full Eyes]]'', which was subsequently released in January 2012.

===Hiatus (2012–2013)===
The band recorded a track for the ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' episode "[[Walk of Punishment]]", entitled "[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair (song)|The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]", and released it, alongside a new track, "Criminal Fingers", for [[Record Store Day]] 2013. Regarding the release, guitarist Tad Kubler stated, "Steve [Selvidge] – our guitar player wasn’t in the band when we did the last record so we haven’t formally released anything that he’s played on – other than an [[iTunes]] session or something like that. Having been away for a few years, we thought this would be a great opportunity to reintroduce the newest version of the band."<ref name="billboard1">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1556745/the-hold-steady-figuring-out-new-album-unveiling-new-lineup-on-record-store |title=The Hold Steady 'Figuring Out' New Album, Unveiling New Lineup on Record Store Day Single |work=Billboard |access-date=June 15, 2013}}</ref>

On January 8, 2014, The Hold Steady announced the release of their sixth LP entitled ''[[Teeth Dreams]]''. The album was released on March 25 via Washington Square, a new imprint of record label [[Razor & Tie]]. In addition, the band announced the release of a covers EP entitled ''RAGS'', whose proceeds go towards the K + L Guardian Foundation to benefit the children of deceased super fan Mike "Jersey Mike" Van Jura.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/legal-and-management/5862598/razor-tie-launches-new-imprint-washington-square-hold |title=Razor & Tie Launches New Imprint Washington Square, Hold Steady Is First Signing (Exclusive) |work=Billboard |access-date=February 11, 2014}}</ref>

===Nicolay's return, concert residencies, and ''Thrashing Thru the Passion'' (2016-2020)===

In 2016, Nicolay rejoined the band, expanding its lineup to a six-piece. The band soon began performing three-night residencies in specific cities, as opposed to embarking on full tours. In 2016, they performed residencies in Chicago and Brooklyn, and returned to both the following year for the named events, ''Chicago Seemed Wired Last Night'' and ''Massive Nights'', before performing over three nights in London for ''Boys & Girls in London'' in 2018.

In late 2017, to coincide with the band's 2017 ''Massive Nights'' residency, the band released two new songs, "Entitlement Crew" and "Snake in the Shower", with two further tracks, "Eureka" and "Esther", from the same recording sessions accompanying ''Boys & Girls in London''. The recordings are the first to feature the full six-person Hold Steady line-up.

On March 4, 2019, the band released their first song of 2019; ''The Last Time She Talked To Me''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musicnewsnet.com/2019/03/music-news-the-hold-steady-are-releasing-their-first-new-song-of-2019-the-last-time-she-talked-to-me-arrives-at-all-dsps-an.html|title=THE HOLD STEADY RELEASE FIRST NEW SONG OF 2019, "The Last Time She Talked To Me"|website=Music News Net|access-date=June 25, 2019}}</ref>

==Influences==
In an interview with [[Pitchfork Media]], Craig Finn outlined the band's influences:
{{cquote|Growing up in [[Minneapolis]], [[Hüsker Dü]] was a huge band. I always thought [[Grant Hart]] was the better songwriter, and his lyrics were very specific. [[Bob Mould]] kind of favored vague lyrics. But as far as detail-oriented songwriters, more contemporary... certainly [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Jim Carroll]], [[John Darnielle]] from [[The Mountain Goats]]. A lot of [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] really inspires me. My absolute favorite stuff is [[Brother Ali]] from [[Rhymesayers]]. [[Atmosphere (music group)|Atmosphere]], obviously. Things like [[Aesop Rock]], [[Sage Francis]], [[Murs (rapper)|Murs]], all those guys. Even [[Jay-Z]]. Hip-hop is so much about lyrics, and as a lyricist it's hard not to be inspired by it.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6043-the-hold-steady/ | last= Howe | first= Brian | title= Interview: The Hold Steady | publisher= Pitchfork Media}}</ref>}}
