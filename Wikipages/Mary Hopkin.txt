'''Mary Hopkin''' (born 3 May 1950), credited on some recordings as '''Mary Visconti''' (from her marriage to [[Tony Visconti]]), is a Welsh singer songwriter best known for her 1968 UK number&nbsp;1 single "[[Those Were the Days (song)|Those Were the Days]]". She was one of the first artists to be signed to [[the Beatles]]' [[Apple Records|Apple]] label.

==Biography==
===Early singing career===
Hopkin was born into a [[Welsh language|Welsh]]-speaking family in [[Pontardawe]], [[Wales]]; her father worked as a housing officer.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/wales/entries/7e451cd8-d749-3926-9114-a53b9c0692fb |title=Those Were The Days: the Mary Hopkin story |date=5 September 2013 |website=BBC}}</ref> She took weekly singing lessons as a child and began her musical career as a folk singer with a local group called the Selby Set and Mary. She released an [[Extended play|EP]] of Welsh-language songs for a local record label called Cambrian, based in her hometown, before signing to [[Apple Records]], owned by [[the Beatles]], one of the first artists to do so.<ref name="500 Number One Hits"/> The model [[Twiggy]] saw her winning the British [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] television talent show ''[[Opportunity Knocks (UK TV series)|Opportunity Knocks]]'' and recommended her to [[Paul McCartney]].<ref name="500 Number One Hits">{{cite book |first= Jo |last= Rice |year= 1982 |title= The Guinness Book of 500 Number One Hits |edition= 1st |publisher= Guinness Superlatives Ltd |location= Enfield, Middlesex |page= 120 |isbn= 0-85112-250-7}}</ref>

Her debut single, "[[Those Were the Days (song)|Those Were the Days]]", produced by McCartney, was released in the UK on 30 August 1968. Despite competition from well-established star [[Sandie Shaw]], whose single was also released that year, Hopkin's version became a [[Record chart#Chart hit|number 1 hit]] on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

On 2 October 1968, Hopkin appeared at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in London for the ''Pop Experience'', where she sang "[[Morning of My Life]]", "[[Turn! Turn! Turn!|Turn Turn Turn]]" and "[[Plaisir d'amour]]".<ref name="Fan"/> In December that year, the ''[[NME]]'' music magazine reported that Hopkin was considering a lead acting role in [[Stanley Baker]]'s planned film ''Rape of the Fair Country'', which was to be based on [[Rape of the Fair Country| Alexander Cordell's book of the same name]].<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book

On 21 February 1969, Hopkin's debut album, ''[[Post Card (album)|Post Card]]'', again produced by McCartney, was released.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic |class=artist |id=p87792/biography |pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography by Richie Unterberger |publisher=Allmusic.com |access-date=24 March 2009}}</ref> It included [[cover version|covers]] of three songs from [[Donovan]], who also played on the album, and one song each from [[George Martin]] and [[Harry Nilsson]]. It reached number 3 on the [[UK Albums Chart]], although it proved to be her solitary success in that chart.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> In the United States, ''Post Card'' reached number 28 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard 200|albums chart]].<ref name="AMG Chart"/>

The next single was "[[Goodbye (Mary Hopkin song)|Goodbye]]", written by McCartney (credited to [[Lennon–McCartney]]), and released on 26 March 1969.<ref name="Womack p 336">{{cite book |last=Womack |first=Kenneth |author-link=Kenneth Womack |year=2014 |title=The Beatles Encyclopedia: Everything Fab Four |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara, CA |isbn= 978-0-313-39171-2 |p=336}}</ref> It reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart,<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> number 13 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100,<ref name="Womack p 336" /> and number 15 on the ''RPM'' chart in Canada.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/028020/f2/nlc008388.5950.pdf |title=RPM Top 100 Singles - May 26, 1969}}</ref> Hopkin said she interpreted "Goodbye" as McCartney pledging to stop "[[Micromanagement|micromanaging]]" her career, since she was uncomfortable with his positioning of her as a pop chanteuse.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Stuart |last1=Shea |first2=Robert |last2=Rodriguez |title=Fab Four FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the Beatles&nbsp;... and More! |publisher=Hal Leonard |location=New York, NY |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4234-2138-2 |pp=259–60}}</ref> She also expressed dissatisfaction with her manager at this time, [[Terry Doran]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Everett |first=Walter |author-link=Walter Everett (musicologist) |year=1999 |title=The Beatles as Musicians: Revolver Through the Anthology |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-19-512941-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTkHAldi4bEC&dq |p=208}}</ref>

Hopkin's third single, "[[Temma Harbour]]", was a re-arrangement of a [[Philip Kinorra|Philamore Lincoln]] song. Her first single not to be produced by McCartney,<ref name="Winn p 316">{{cite book |last=Winn |first=John C. |year=2009 |title=That Magic Feeling: The Beatles' Recorded Legacy, Volume Two, 1966–1970 |publisher=Three Rivers Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-307-45239-9 |p=316}}</ref> it was released on 16 January 1970 and peaked at number 6 in the UK and number 42 in Canada.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/028020/f2/nlc008388.5912.pdf |title=RPM Top 100 Singles - April 18, 1970}}</ref> In the US, "Temma Harbour" reached number 39 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and number 4 on the magazine's Easy Listening chart.<ref>''Billboard'' magazine, March 1970.</ref> Along with Donovan and [[Billy Preston]], Hopkin was one of the chorus singers on the [[Radha Krishna Temple]]'s 1970 hit single "[[Govinda (Radha Krishna Temple song)|Govinda]]", produced by [[George Harrison]] for Apple Records.<ref>{{cite book |last=Greene |first=Joshua M. |title=Here Comes the Sun: The Spiritual and Musical Journey of George Harrison |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=Hoboken, NJ|year=2006 |isbn=978-0-470-12780-3 |p=170}}</ref>

===Eurovision===
In March 1970, Hopkin represented the United Kingdom in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1970|1970 Eurovision Song Contest]], achieving second place with "[[Knock, Knock Who's There?]]"<ref name="500 Number One Hits"/> Although she gave a confident performance and sang in a crystal-clear voice, and despite being the pre-contest favourite, Hopkin lost to "[[All Kinds of Everything]]", performed by Irish singer [[Dana Rosemary Scallon|Dana]].<ref>O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History. Carlton Books, UK, 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-84442-994-3}}</ref> Produced by [[Mickie Most]], "Knock, Knock Who's There?" was released as a single on 23 March 1970 and peaked at number 2 in the UK.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> It was a worldwide hit, selling over a million copies.

Hopkin's final big hit was "Think About Your Children", released in October 1970, which reached number 19 in the UK. Hopkin has expressed dissatisfaction with the material produced by Most, who had taken over as her producer with "Temma Harbour". After appearing in Eurovision, Hopkin wanted to return to her folk-music roots.

===After Eurovision===
At McCartney's insistence, Hopkin had recorded a cover of "[[Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)|Que Sera, Sera]]" in August 1969.{{sfn|Everett|1999|pp=349–50}} Hopkin had no wish to record the song and refused to have the single released in Britain.{{sfn|Everett|1999|pp=349–50}} Initially issued in France in September 1969, it was released in North America in June 1970. <ref name="Winn p 316" /> The single peaked at number 77 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100<ref name="Winn p 316" /> and number 47 in Canada,{{cn|date=July 2018}} and was also a hit in Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Rhodesia (nowadays called Zimbabwe).

The last single to hit the British charts was "Let My Name Be Sorrow", which reached number 46 in July 1971. It was produced by [[Tony Visconti]], whom Hopkin had met earlier for a Welsh recording of "Sparrow". "Let My Name Be Sorrow" was a hit in Poland in January 1972.

Hopkin's second album, ''Earth Song, Ocean Song'', was released by Apple on 1 October 1971. The album was produced by Visconti and included cover versions of songs written by [[Cat Stevens]], [[Gallagher and Lyle]] and [[Ralph McTell]], as well as the two title tracks by Liz Thorsen. Hopkin felt it was the album she had always wanted to make, so, coinciding with her marriage to Visconti and with little left to prove, she left the music scene.<ref name="Earth Song">{{cite web | url=http://www.applerecords.com/#!/albums/Earth_Song_Ocean_Song | title=Earth Song, Ocean Song | publisher=Apple Records | access-date=2015-09-29}}</ref> The album's single, "Water, Paper and Clay", missed the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. It was Hopkin's last single for Apple Records, which she left in March 1972.

After Hopkin's departure from Apple, a compilation album titled ''Those Were the Days'' was released in the latter part of 1972. The album featured all of Hopkin's hits but failed to chart. ”Knock Knock, Who's There?" was released as a single in the United States and Canada, both countries having been excluded from the first release of that record in 1970. The single reached number 92 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and number 11 on the Easy Listening chart in December 1972, giving Hopkin her last US hit.

===Television series===
Following her appearance in the Eurovision contest, Hopkin had her own [[peak time]] TV series, ''Mary Hopkin in the Land of ...'', on [[BBC One|BBC 1]]. Created by [[Eric Merriman]], each episode featured Hopkin looking at a different aspect of storytelling through music and dance. The six 30-minute programmes were broadcast in 1970 and were repeated in 1971.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mary Hopkin in the Land of Films |url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbcone/london/1970-11-6 |website=Genome - Radio Times 1923-2009 |publisher=BBC |access-date=5 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Mary Hopkin in the Land of Legend |url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbcone/london/1970-11-13 |website=Genome - Radio Times 1923-2009 |publisher=BBC |access-date=5 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Mary Hopkin in the Land of Theatre |url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbcone/london/1970-11-20 |website=Genome - Radio Times 1923-2009 |publisher=BBC |access-date=5 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Mary Hopkin in the Land of Books |url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbcone/london/1970-11-27 |website=Genome - Radio Times 1923-2009 |publisher=BBC |access-date=5 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Mary Hopkin in the Land of Rhymes |url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbcone/london/1970-12-04 |website=Genome - Radio Times 1923-2009 |publisher=BBC |access-date=5 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Mary Hopkin in the Land of Pantomime |url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbcone/london/1970-12-11 |website=Genome - Radio Times 1923-2009 |publisher=BBC |access-date=5 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Mary Hopkin in the land of |url=http://www.tvpopdiaries.co.uk/maryhopkin.html |website=TV Pop Diaries |access-date=5 June 2018}}{{self-published source|date=June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Mary Hopkin in the Land of Films |url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbcone/london/1971-05-07 |website=Genome - Radio Times 1923-2009 |publisher=BBC |access-date=5 June 2018}}</ref>

===After the hit singles===
After marrying Visconti in 1971,<ref name="500 Number One Hits"/> Hopkin withdrew from the [[popular music|pop]]-music scene to have a family. Although reportedly unhappy with show business, she did not stop recording. She travelled to Australia with Visconti in January 1972 and performed at a large outdoor rock festival in South Australia, in addition to giving concerts in several major cities.{{cn|date=July 2018}} In March, Hopkin announced her departure from Apple Records; her manager, [[Jo Lustig]], said they were considering offers from "three major [record] companies".<ref>{{cite book|last=Badman|first=Keith|title=The Beatles Diary Volume 2: After the Break-Up 1970–2001|publisher=Omnibus Press|location=London|year=2001|isbn=978-0-7119-8307-6|p=68}}</ref> In June, the single "Summertime Summertime" / "Sweet and Low" was released on [[Bell Records#Bell Records UK|Bell Records]] under the name of Hobby Horse. The A-side was a cover of a 1958 song by [[the Jamies]]. With Visconti's assistance, she released the 1972 Christmas single "Mary Had a Baby" / "Cherry Tree Carol" on [[Regal Zonophone Records]].

Hopkin starred in her own, one-off TV special for BBC 1 on 29 July 1972. Titled ''Sing Hi, Sing Lo'', it was billed simply as "light entertainment starring Mary Hopkin".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/ba08396a622853f675ced2936c50cb37|title=Sing Hi, Sing Lo|date=29 July 1972|issue=2542|pages=16|via=BBC Genome}}</ref>

Although no other singles or albums came out in her name until 1976, she sang on numerous recordings that her husband produced, such as those featuring [[Tom Paxton]], Ralph McTell, [[David Bowie]] (''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]''), [[Bert Jansch]], [[The Radiators from Space]], [[Thin Lizzy]], Carmen, Sarstedt Brothers, [[Osibisa]], [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]], [[Hazel O'Connor]], and [[Elaine Paige]]. On all of these recordings (and also on her husband's own ''Inventory'' album) she is credited as "Mary Visconti". During this time, she also appeared on various TV shows such as [[Cilla Black]]'s, and various radio programmes.

===Return to recording===
In 1976, she returned to recording under her birth name and released the single "[[If You Love Me (Really Love Me)]]" (originally recorded by [[Édith Piaf]] as "[[Hymne à l'amour]]"), which reached Number 32 in the UK chart.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> The [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], "Tell Me Now", was an original composition by Hopkin. Her next single was "Wrap Me in Your Arms", with the B-side again written by Hopkin ("Just A Dreamer"). These singles came out on Visconti's Good Earth Records label.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> Several songs recorded for an album at the time have now been released under Hopkin's own label, Mary Hopkin Music.<ref name="Mary"/>

Two members of [[Steeleye Span]] (Bob Johnson and Pete Knight) chose Hopkin to play "Princess Lirazel" on their [[concept album]] ''[[The King of Elfland's Daughter (album)|The King of Elfland's Daughter]]''. She also appeared at the [[Cambridge Folk Festival]] with [[Bert Jansch]]. In 1976, her second child was born. Before the 1970s ended, [[Decca Records|Decca]] released a [[compilation album]] of Hopkin's Cambrian recordings, ''The Welsh World of Mary Hopkin''.

===1980s===
[[File:MHbrightonwiki.jpg|thumb|Hopkin in 1982]]
Hopkin's first project in the 1980s was a well-reviewed stint playing the Virgin Mary in ''Rock Nativity'' at the Hexagon Theatre in [[Reading, Berkshire]].<ref name="Fan">{{cite web |url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/pat.richmonds/diary2.htm |title=Diary 1971 - 1980 |publisher=homepage.ntlworld.com/pat.richmonds |date=1981-01-17 |access-date=2015-08-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053614/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/pat.richmonds/diary2.htm |archive-date=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> After this, [[Mike Hurst (producer)|Mike Hurst]] (record producer and formerly of [[the Springfields]]) asked her to sing lead in a new group named Sundance that he had formed with [[Mike de Albuquerque]] of [[Electric Light Orchestra|ELO]].<ref name="500 Number One Hits"/> Their only single, "What's Love", allowed them to tour the UK with [[Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show|Dr. Hook]] but Hopkin quickly left the group, dissatisfied with the gigs. "What's Love" proved very popular in South Africa, albeit the only territory where it charted, peaking at no.10 in April 1982. In 2002, Hurst released recordings from this time on the [[Angel Air Records|Angel Air]] label.

Hopkin and Visconti divorced in 1981. The following year she provided vocals on "Rachael's Song" for the [[Vangelis]] soundtrack of ''[[Blade Runner (soundtrack)|Blade Runner]]''. Around 1984, [[Peter Skellern]] asked her to join him and [[Julian Lloyd Webber]] in a group called [[Oasis (1980s band)|Oasis]]. Their self-titled and only album, ''[[Oasis (Oasis album)|Oasis]]'', was released on [[Warner Music Group|WEA]] along with two singles. The album reached number 23 on the UK album chart in 1984 and remained there for 14 weeks. A [[concert tour|tour]] of the UK was planned but was brought to an abrupt end because Hopkin became ill. The group disbanded shortly afterwards.

During the 1980s, Hopkin appeared in several charity shows, including an appearance at the [[London Palladium]] with Ralph McTell. In 1988, she took part in George Martin's production of [[Dylan Thomas]]' ''[[Under Milk Wood]]''. She played the character Rosie Probert and performed a piece called "Love Duet" with [[Freddie Jones]] as Captain Cat. The making of the record was filmed and made into a special edition of ''[[The South Bank Show]]'', where Hopkin and Jones were shown rehearsing and recording "Love Duet". In 1992, the cast reunited for a performance of the play as a tribute to Thomas in the presence of [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] for [[The Prince's Trust]].<ref name="Fan"/>

Hopkin recorded an album called ''Spirit'' in 1989. This was released on the [[Trax Records|Trax]] label and is a collection of light classical songs and featured the single "[[Ave Maria (Bach/Gounod)|Ave Maria]]". The record was produced by Benny Gallagher, of [[Gallagher and Lyle]], who had contributed songs to her during her days at Apple Records.

===1990s===
Early in 1990, Hopkin sang with [[The Chieftains]] at the [[London Palladium]] in a charity show and later joined them on a tour of the UK.

She continued to do projects of her choosing, working with people such as [[Julian Colbeck]]; she wrote the [[lyrics]] and performed a song on his CD ''Back to Bach''. Also, there was Marc Cerrone's ''The Collector'', a stage play/opera, for which she performed two songs on the CD and video. She worked again with old friends, the guitarist [[Brian Willoughby]] and [[Dave Cousins]] (of [[Strawbs]]) on their CD ''The Bridge''. She also appeared on a Beatles' [[tribute album]] by RAM Pietsch.

[[File:Y Caneuon Cynnar - The Early Recordings, album cover.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Album cover of ''Y Caneuon Cynnar – The Early Recordings'']]
In 1996, the Welsh label [[Sain]] bought Cambrian's back catalogue and released all of Hopkin's Welsh recordings on a CD called ''Y Caneuon Cynnar/The Early Recordings'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Mary Hopkin – Y Caneuon Cynnar / The Early Recordings|url=http://www.sainwales.com/store/sain/sain-scd-2151|website=[[Sain]]}}</ref> which removed the [[overdubbing|overdubbed]] drums found on the Decca recordings.

In 1999, she again joined The Chieftains on their UK tour and, later that year, performed concerts in Scotland with Benny Gallagher and [[Jim Diamond (singer)|Jim Diamond]].<ref name="Fan"/> There were also three TV documentaries about her, one each for [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]] (1998), [[BBC Television]] (1998) and [[S4C]] (2000).<ref name="Fan"/>

She made a guest appearance on [[The Crocketts]]' album ''The Great Brain Robbery'', sang the [[theme music|theme song]] for [[Billy Connolly]]'s BBC TV series [[Billy Connolly's World Tour of England, Ireland and Wales|''World Tour of England, Ireland and Wales'']] and re-recorded "Those Were The Days" with [[Robin Williams]] [[rapping]]. She also appeared in the [[Sara Sugarman]] film ''[[Very Annie Mary]]''.

===2000s===
In September 2005, she released a retrospective album on a label run by her daughter, Mary Hopkin Music, titled ''Live at the Royal Festival Hall 1972''.<ref name="Mary"/> It was followed in December 2006 by a Christmas recording, "Snowed Under", released on download only.

To celebrate her 57th birthday in 2007, she released an album called ''Valentine'' on her new eponymous label.<ref name="Mary"/> It included 12 previously unheard tracks dating from 1972 to 1980, three of which were written by Hopkin.<ref name="Mary"/> In 2008, a new album, ''Recollections'', was released on her own label.<ref name="Mary"/> It included 11 tracks that were originally recorded between 1970 and 1986, alongside a CD of three Christmas songs which included "Mary Had a Baby" and "[[The Cherry-Tree Carol]]" (these tracks were first released on Regal Zonophone in 1972) and "Snowed Under", which was released in 2006 as a download only.

Her final archival CD, ''Now and Then'', was released in May 2009. It comprises 14 tracks recorded between 1970 and 1988. She sang the song "Y 'deryn pur" ("Gentle Bird") on the album ''Blodeugerdd: Song of the Flowers – An Anthology of Welsh Music and Song'' released by Smithsonian Folkways Recordings in June 2009.

===2010s===
Hopkin's daughter, [[Jessica Lee Morgan]], released her first CD, called ''I Am Not'', on which Hopkin sings on several songs.

In October 2010, Hopkin and her son, Morgan Visconti, released ''You Look Familiar'', a collaboration which brings together Hopkin's melodies, lyrics and vocals with her son's instrumentation and arrangements.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bio|url=http://www.morganvisconti.com/biography/|website=Morgan Visconti|access-date=20 November 2017}}</ref>

In 2013, ''Painting by Numbers'' was released on Mary Hopkin Music. The album includes 10 tracks written by Hopkin, two of which are co-written with friends; "Love Belongs Right Here" with [[Brian Willoughby]] and "Love, Long Distance" with [[Benny Gallagher]].

For Christmas 2014, Hopkin recorded a single with her son and daughter. The traditional carol, "Iesu Faban" (meaning "Baby Jesus" in Welsh), was described on her website as a "close, intimate choral performance of a traditional Welsh Christmas carol".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-30176579|title=Mary Hopkin's Christmas comeback|date=24 November 2014|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of "Those Were the Days", on 30 August 2018 Hopkin released a new acoustic version, on an EP also featuring the live version from her 1972 "farewell" concert at the [[Royal Festival Hall]]. Also included are the versions of "Those Were the Days" and "Goodbye" released in 1977, produced by her then husband, Tony Visconti.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.maryhopkin.com/pages/TWTD18.html|title=Those Were The Days – Mary Hopkin|website=www.maryhopkin.com|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>{{cn|date=September 2018}}
