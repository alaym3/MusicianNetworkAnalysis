'''''People Just Do Nothing''''' is a British television [[mockumentary]] sitcom, created and performed by [[Allan Mustafa]], Steve Stamp, [[Asim Chaudhry]] and Hugo Chegwin. 

The programme follows the lives of MC Grindah, DJ Beats and their friends, who run '''Kurupt FM''', a [[pirate radio]] station broadcasting [[UK garage]] and [[drum and bass]] music from [[Brentford]] in [[West London (sub-region)|West London]]. 

The programme originally began as a series of online shorts that became popular enough that the group were asked to make a pilot episode for [[BBC3]]'s [[Comedy Feeds]]. The first series was released on [[BBC Three]] in July 2014, with the fifth and final series airing on [[BBC Two]] in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.shortlist.com/entertainment/tv/people-just-do-nothing-series-five/355383|title=One of the funniest TV shows of recent years has been renewed for a final season|date=1 May 2018|access-date=23 September 2018}}</ref> A film continuation, ''[[People Just Do Nothing: Big In Japan]]'', was released in August 2021.

In 2017, the show won the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] award and [[Royal Television Society]] award for Best Scripted Comedy.<ref name=nme>[http://www.nme.com/news/tv/bafta-tv-awards-2017-full-winners-list-2072034 BAFTA TV Awards 2017: Full winners' list]. NME.</ref><ref name=rts/> Many of the actors in the show have gone on to tour as a musical act, in character as their personas from Kurupt FM.

In 2018, [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] ordered a pilot episode for a U.S remake of the series, set in [[Las Vegas]] around a DJ crew called 'Whet Desert'<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/25/people-just-do-nothing-primed-for-us-remake-set-in-las-vegas|title=People Just Do Nothing primed for US remake set in Las Vegas|date=25 October 2018|website=the Guardian}}</ref> In 2020 it was announced that the project would not be going forward.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2020/01/people-just-do-nothing-u-s-remake-not-going-forward-at-amazon-1202830478/|title='People Just Do Nothing': U.S. Remake Not Going Forward At Amazon|first1=Peter|last1=White|date=14 January 2020}}</ref>

==Premise==
''People Just do Nothing'' is a [[mockumentary]], in which the characters give interviews to the camera and are taped in a loose, documentary fashion. An off-screen interviewer is occasionally heard. The "documentary" follows the fortunes of "Kurupt FM", a [[pirate radio]] station broadcasting [[UK garage]] from a flat in [[Brentford]], [[West London]]. 

The main characters are MC Grindah, DJ Beats, DJ Steves, and their entrepreneurial manager, Chabuddy G. The show follows their personal lives, with a strong focus on their relationships with their respective female partners such as Miche and Roche.

All of the characters have an inflated sense of their own talent and success; Steve Stamp, who portrays Steves, said "A lot of talented people don’t have enough confidence, but then there’s a lot of stupid people with no talent who have loads of confidence ... All our characters are super confident; they’re just not good at what they do."<ref name=lat/> The characters fail to recognise their lowly status, with Grindah regularly making comments like "We're going global, but you will very much have to be in the Brentford area to hear us."<ref name=ds/> The show plays off their stupidity; Rachel Aroesti of ''[[The Guardian]]'' has said, "Every character is really, quite comfortingly, dense, and their inability to read scenarios correctly is the source of nearly all the comedy."<ref name=guardian2/> The show was summarised by Jamie Clifton of ''[[Vice Media|Vice]]'' as:
{{quote|You don't need to know anything about garage to get it; the humour is in the hopelessness. Most of the principal characters are completely deluded in some way – Chabuddy, who believes his wife loves him, when she clearly does not. Or Grindah, who claims to reign over all MCs from a pirate station that only broadcasts five miles into London. You laugh at their failures, but it's a weird kind of [[schadenfreude]] because every character is so endearing you want them to succeed, not relentlessly embarrass themselves in front of a TV crew.<ref name=vice/>}}

==Cast and characters==
===Main===
* [[Allan Mustafa|Allan "Seapa" Mustafa]] as Anthony "MC Grindah" Zografos, the [[Emceeing|MC]] and founder/leader of the [[radio station]]. Grindah proclaims himself to be a musical genius.
* Hugo Chegwin as Kevin "DJ Beats" Bates, the principal [[Disc jockey|DJ]]. Beats is the best friend of Grindah but is often bullied by him, much to the frustration of his partner, Roche.
* [[Asim Chaudhry]] as Chabud "Chabuddy G" Gul, a failed local entrepreneur. Confident and smooth-talking but deluded, his schemes usually bring trouble to the group.
* Steve Stamp as Steven "Steves" Green, an uncouth [[Substance dependence|drug addict]] and dull-witted [[lovable loser]]. His nan originally owns the flat from which the station broadcasts.

* George Keywood as Craig, Roche's son from a former marriage, in his late teens, he is mostly at home playing video games.

==Production==
===Conception===
The four main actors were friends for years before they began making the show. They were brought together through Hugo Chegwin; he had known Steve Stamp since childhood, became friends with Asim Chaudhry at college, and met Allan Mustafa through a mutual friend. They all had experience [[DJ]]ing or [[Emceeing|MCing]] on [[pirate radio]] in their youth, and no ambition to be actors. Mustafa said, "I rapped at the time, but we never really ended up making music. We just watched ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' a lot and smoked weed."<ref name=vice/> In the late 2000s, Chegwin and Stamp had a "fake garage crew" on a real station called KuruptFM. Chegwin and Mustafa began creating characters and filming them, and were further inspired when they watched the BBC documentary series ''[[Tower Block Dreams]]'', about London and Essex's [[underground music]] scene, and found the participants amusing. MC Grindah was based on a pirate radio boss from the series. Stamp and Chaudhry became involved, and the foursome began improvising material and putting it on [[YouTube]] under the name "Wasteman TV".<ref name=vice>{{cite web|title=We Visited the Set of 'People Just Do Nothing' Series Three|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/kw97jn/people-just-do-nothing-set-visit-interview-kurupt-fm|website=Vice|date=12 August 2016}}</ref><ref name=lat/> 

The YouTube videos were seen by producer Jon Petrie, who worked with [[Ash Atalla]] at Roughcut TV.  Petrie later explained, "It wasn't fully-formed, but the more you watched it, the more you could see there was proper detail to the characters. I had no idea about [[UK garage|garage]], really, but I just loved them as comic creations." Atalla arranged to produce a pilot episode for [[BBC Three]], released in August 2012. The pilot was the most shared video on [[iPlayer]] that month, and the BBC ordered a full series.<ref name=vice/>

Many journalists have commented that the show is heavily influenced by ''The Office''. David Renshaw has said, "At times, Grindah’s delusion in relation to his own success, talent and likeability is a mortifying dance away from full [[David Brent]]."<ref name=guardian/> Chabuddy G has been described as "an Asian [[Del Boy]]", of ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]''.<ref name=ind/> The actors have named their primary influences as ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'', ''[[This is Spinal Tap]]'', [[Alan Partridge]], [[Ali G]], [[Laurel and Hardy]], and [[Mike Leigh]].<ref name=ind/>

===Writing and filming===
Writing credits go to Allan Mustafa and Steve Stamp,<ref>{{cite web|title='People Just Do Nothing': 11 Things You Probably Didn't Know About Kurupt FM|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/people-just-do-nothing-kurupt-fm-bbc-three-series_uk_5992fe19e4b08a2472775ec2|website=Huffington Post|date=15 August 2017}}</ref> but the cast are given freedom to improvise their dialogue and sometimes film scenes spontaneously.<ref name=ind/> By the third series, Mustafa estimated that material was "70/30 percent improvised". Chaudhry explained, "When you've been doing a character for six years, you can just snap into it – you know how they'd react in any situation", adding that he is continuously inspired by his father, "because he's like a real Chabuddy G, just not as ridiculous".<ref name=vice/> The dialogue is often heavy with [[London slang#Modern influences|21st century London slang]]. Much of the filming took place at Chesterton Court on the [[South Acton, London|South Acton]] housing estate, before it was demolished.<ref name=ind/> Series three was shot in [[Peckham]], south-east London.<ref name=vice/> All locations are based on the Haverfield Estate in Brentford, where Chegwin and Stamp grew up.<ref name=ind>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/people-just-do-nothing-how-bbc3s-latest-comedy-started-with-a-series-ofyoutube-webisodes-10386171.html|title=People Just Do Nothing: How BBC3's latest comedy started with a series|first=John|last=Hind|date=13 July 2015|work=The Independent}}</ref>

==Reception==

===Critical response===

''People Just Do Nothing'' has received positive reviews. After the release of the first series, Alex Fletcher of ''[[Digital Spy]]'' called it "the best British comedy in years", and lamented that few people were aware of its "comedic genius". He added, "it packs in more genuine belly laughs in one episode than most recent sitcoms have done in their full lifetime, and [has] nailed that quintessential British sense of humour where we're able to laugh at our own humiliating inadequacies ...  it feels like it belongs in the company of modern comedy greats such as ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'', ''[[Peep Show (British TV series)|Peep Show]]'' and ''[[Phoenix Nights]]''."<ref name=ds>{{cite web|title=People Just Do Nothing: The best British comedy in years is on iPlayer|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/feature/a583701/people-just-do-nothing-the-best-british-comedy-in-years-is-on-iplayer/|website=Digital Spy|date=11 July 2014}}</ref> Gerard O'Donovan of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' gave the pilot episode four stars out of five, and said, "Entertaining, and absolutely of its time, ''People Just Do Nothing'' certainly serves up some good laughs and I look forward to the next three parts."<ref name=tgraph>{{cite news|title=People Just Do Nothing, BBC iPlayer, review: 'impressive'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/10828816/People-Just-Do-Nothing-BBC-iPlayer-review-impressive.html|website=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=14 May 2014|last1=O'Donovan|first1=Gerard}}</ref>

For the second series, David Renshaw of ''[[The Guardian]]'' said it was "a welcome return from the gang", and commented "Despite its larger-than-life characters, ''People Just Do Nothing''’s success lies in its believability ... You get the feeling that if you drove out to Brentford you might actually run in to them." He especially praised the comedy provided by DJ Steves and Chabuddy G.<ref name=guardian>{{cite web|title=Farcical, larger than life – and totally believable: have you been watching People Just Do Nothing? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/aug/12/have-you-been-watching-people-just-do-nothing|website=The Guardian|date=12 August 2015}}</ref> Rachel Aroesti, also of ''The Guardian'', said "the episode where Grindah panics after taking [[ecstasy (drug)|a pill]] at his club night has good claim to be the comic highlight of 2015".<ref name=guardian2>{{cite web|title=Bare jokes: how People Just Do Nothing made sitcoms funny again |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/22/how-people-just-do-nothing-made-sitcoms-funny-again|website=The Guardian|date=22 September 2016}}</ref>

Aroesti gave the third series a highly positive review: "In an age of bleak comedy that barely makes you snigger, one show has been keeping up the lost art of making people laugh – the hilarious, half-witted pirate radio mockumentary." She added, "[the show] is not an old-fashioned sitcom by any stretch – it’s understated, meta and set in a niche subculture – but it is truly traditional in its comedy: beats are hit and joke quotas filled, scene in, scene out." She appreciated that the series also "decided to go for the dramatic jugular. The final episode of this series offered fans a precious opportunity to laugh and cry at exactly the same time ... By making you care about the characters (even the monstrosity that is MC Grindah – a David Brent with malicious intent), viewers will now have two reasons for tuning in."<ref name=guardian2/>

==Kurupt FM live==
The four main actors, along with "Decoy" and "Fantasy", tour nightclubs and music venues as "Kurupt FM", where they appear in character. They have also played music festivals including [[Glastonbury festival|Glastonbury]] and [[Reading and Leeds]]. Mustafa said in 2016, "We all wanted to be musicians when we were younger. So now, in a way, it's like we're living out what we didn't get to do, playing all these festivals. We get two sick jobs: we get to film and we get to fuck around on stage and be headliners." Stamp added, "And because we're in character, we can sort of get away with whatever. Like my shit mixing; it's because I'm Steves, not because I'm a shit DJ." On-stage guests have included artists [[Stormzy]] and [[Big Narstie]].<ref name=vice/>
