== Biography==
At a very young age, Oum joined a [[gospel music|gospel]] choir where she played her first solos at fourteen with a voice that impressed listeners.<ref name="Héraud 2013">{{Cite news|url=http://www.franceinter.fr/emission-ouvert-la-nuit-mendelson-oum-jean-yves-jouannais-jean-raymond-jacob|title=Mendelson + Oum + Jean Yves Jouannais + Jean-Raymond Jacob du 14 mai 2013 – France Inter|newspaper=France Inter|language=fr-FR|access-date=2016-12-18}}</ref>

At seventeen, her first song, "This is your heart" that she wrote to support the charity operation "Les malades du cœur", helped to successfully secure her first appearance on television.<ref name="Héraud 2013" />

In 1996, she entered the National School of Architecture in [[Rabat]].<ref name="Héraud 2013" /> She pursued her studies there until graduation in 2002.<ref name="Héraud 2013" />

At the same time, she began to perform in public.<ref name="Héraud 2013" /> With a powerful and expressive voice, she takes over the repertoire of [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]] or [[Whitney Houston]].<ref name="Héraud 2013" />

In 1998, Oum did her first attempts with [[hip-hop music|hip-hop]] and [[contemporary R&B|RnB]] with [[Djo Catangana]], a [[music executive|producer]] and creator of the [[French hip hop]] [[artist collective|collective]] [[Mafia Trece]].<ref name="Héraud 2013" />

In 2002, she was noticed by [[Philippe Delmas]], who invited her to Paris. For two years, she alternated recording sessions and concerts in Casablanca with the [[Brotherwood (band)|Brotherhood band]].<ref name="Héraud 2013" /> In 2004, she ended her Parisian period.<ref name="Héraud 2013" />

Back in Morocco, she entered new musical universes: the [[Gnawa music|Gnaoui]] and the [[Hassaniya Arabic|Hassani]].<ref name="Héraud 2013" /> Oum's decision to introduce such local forms of rhythms not only influenced her songs' tunes but also her lyrics. She performed with Barry, a musician known for his fusion of musical styles and repertoires, on the stages of the [[Gnaoua World Music Festival]] in [[Essaouira]], the [[Tanjazz]] in [[Tangier]], and the [[Barcelona Acció Musical]] in [[Barcelona]].<ref name="Héraud 2013" />

Oum, who grew up in [[Marrakech]], is a soul singer. Yet, her style remains unique since it is highly inspired by influences such as the [[Hassaniya Arabic|Hassani]] poetry (Moroccan desert culture) and African rhythms.

Her first album ''Lik 'Oum'' appeared in Casablanca in May 2009.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.maghress.com/fr/albayane/2384|title=Oum, la chanteuse de Saoul au look coloré arrive au Maroc !|newspaper=Maghress|access-date=2016-12-18}}</ref>

''Whowa'' means "him" in dialectical [[Moroccan Darija]] in the first single from her second album ''Sweerty'' -means "luck" in Moroccan dialectical Arabic ([[Darija]]). It was released with a video clip in January 2010. In July 2012, she released [[Harguin]], a collaboration with [[Blitz the Ambassador]] on the theme of [[illegal immigration]] from [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. ''Sweerty'' was released in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://achnoo.com/2012/01/20/musique-sortie-du-nouvel-album-doum-intitule-sweerty-le-4-fevrier-prochain/|title=Nothing found for 2012 01 20 Musique Sortie Du Nouvel Album Doum Intitule Sweerty Le 4 Fevrier Prochain|access-date=2016-12-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625121911/http://achnoo.com/2012/01/20/musique-sortie-du-nouvel-album-doum-intitule-sweerty-le-4-fevrier-prochain/|archive-date=25 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In September 2015, she released her fourth album: ''Zarabi'', which means "carpets" in [[Moroccan Darija]] and it is a tribute to the carpet weavers of the village of [[M'Hamid El Ghizlane]]. She wrote and co-directed it with [[Mathis Haug]]. [[Yacir Rami]] accompanied her on the Oud and Rhani Krija on the percussions.

Her song "Taragalte", from the album ''Soul of Morocco'', was used in the 2018 movie ''[[Beirut (film)|Beirut]]''.
