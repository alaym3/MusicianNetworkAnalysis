'''Kashk''' ({{lang-fa|کَشک}} ''Kašk'') or '''qurut''' ([[Tuvan language|Tuvan]] and {{lang-ky|курут}}, {{lang-kk|құрт}}, {{lang-tk|gurt}}, {{lang-uz|qurt}}, {{lang-az|qurut}}, {{lang-ps|قروت}}, {{lang-hy|չորթան}}-''chortan,'' [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''kurut'') is a range of dairy products used in cuisines of [[Iranian cuisine|Iranian]], [[Afghan cuisine|Afghan]], [[Pakistani cuisine|Pakistani]],  [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], [[Kurdish cuisine|Kurdish]], [[Mongolian cuisine|Mongolian]], [[Central Asian cuisine|Central Asian]],  [[Caucasian cuisine|Transcaucasian]] and the [[Levantine cuisine|Levantine]] people. Kashk is made from [[Strained yogurt|drained yogurt]] (in particular, drained [[qatiq]]) or drained [[sour milk]] by shaping it and letting it dry. It can be made in a variety of forms, like rolled into balls, sliced into strips, and formed into chunks.

There are three main kinds of food products with this name: foods based on curdled [[milk]] products like [[yogurt]] or [[cheese]]; foods based on [[barley]] broth, bread, or flour; and foods based on [[cereal]]s combined with curdled milk.

==Background==
[[File:Mercado de Chorsu 03.jpg|thumb|Balls of kashk at [[Chorsu Bazaar]], Tashkent, [[Uzbek cuisine|Uzbekistan]]]]
The ancient form of ''kashk'' is a [[porridge]] of [[grain]]s fermented with [[whey]] and dried in the sun.<ref>{{cite news |title=Food facts: A conversation with Gil Marks |work=Times of Israel |date=November 4, 2010 |url=https://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/food-facts-a-conversation-with-gil-marks/}}</ref> The long shelf-life and nutritional value of ''kashk'' made it a useful item for peasants during the winter months, as well as soldiers and travelers.<ref name="brill">{{cite book |last=Lewicka |first=Paulina |title=Food and Foodways of Medieval Cairenes: Aspects of Life in an Islamic Metropolis of the Eastern Mediterranean |date=2011 |publisher=Brill |page=230 |isbn=9789004194724 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7HTqyTrJmVQC&pg=PA230}}</ref> ''Kashk'' is the origin of ''[[tarhana]]'' found in the moderns cuisines of [[Turkey]] and [[Greece]], where it is called ''trachanas'' ({{lang|el|τραχανάς}}).<ref name="brill"/>

==Kashk in different languages and cultures==

''Kashk'' is found in the cuisines of [[Iranian cuisine|Iran]], [[Iraqi cuisine|Iraq]], [[Syrian cuisine|Syria]], [[Egyptian cuisine|Egypt]], the [[Caucasian cuisine|Caucasus]], and [[Turkish cuisine|Turkey]]. This expansive geographic area contains different language groups, contributing to the complexity of pinpointing the development and usage of this term. In some languages it is called kashk or kishkh, ({{lang-fa|کشک}}, {{lang-ar|كشك}}, {{lang-ku|keşk}}, {{lang-tr|keş peyniri}}), ''qurut'' in others  ({{lang-kz|құрт}}, {{lang-tk|gurt}}, {{lang-uz|qurt}}, {{lang-az|qurut}}, {{lang-ky|курут}}, {{lang-ps|قروت}}, {{lang-tr|kurut, sürk, taş yoğurt, kurutulmuş yoğurt}}, {{lang-cjs|қурут}}, {{lang-kjh|хурут}}). There are many varied names for this class of dishes including ''jameed'' ({{lang-ar|جميد}}), ''chortan'' ({{lang-hy|[[wikt:en:չորթան|չորթան]]}}) and ''aaruul, khuruud'' ({{lang-mn|ааруул, хурууд}}). ''Chortan'' is mentioned in the 19th century Armenian epic poem ''[[David of Sassoun|Daredevils of Sassoun]]'', said to be based on an 8th-century oral tradition.<ref>{{cite book |script-title=ru:Давид Сасунский |script-chapter=ru:Давид и сборщики дани | language = ru | url = http://maxima-library.org/knigi/languages/b/284086?format=read }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Haroutyunian|first1=S.

According to Francoise Aubaile-Sallenave, the first known literary use of the term{{clarify|reason=kashk or chortan?|date=September 2021}} comes from the Armenian historian [[Yeghishe]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gueriguian |first=John L |title=Foods and Drinks in Fifteenth Century Anatolia, as Recorded by Amirdovlat Amasiasti |journal=Journal of the Society for Armenian Studies |volume=14 |date=2005 |pages=155–166}}</ref> In the 10th-century Persian ''[[Shahnameh]]'' ("Book of Kings") by [[Firdausi]] the term is used in the sense of "barley flour", but it's also used for a mixture of cracked wheat and cracked barley.<ref name=oxford441>{{cite book |last=Davidson |first=Alan |title=The Oxford Companion to Food |date=21 August 2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=441 |isbn=9780191040726 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bIIeBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA441}}</ref> Aubaile-Sallenave argues that the original Persian ''kashk'' known from early [[Persian literature]] was made with [[barley]] that contained either a mix of leaven with water or some fermented milk. To answer questions about the modern meaning in Iran for a dried dairy dish she argued "Iranian speaking pastorialists, for whom dried sour milk was a staple, and who had no easy access to barley, applied the word ''kashk'' by analogy to dry sour milk". [[Charles Perry (food writer)|Charles Perry]] offers an alternate explanation based on the 13th century Arabic cookbook ''Wasf al-Atimah al-Mutadah'' which says dried yogurt was a [[Turkmens|Turkomen]] style "kashk".<ref>{{cite book| title=Milk-- Beyond the Dairy: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tuor2vcVtiQC&pg=PA312 |page=312 |date=1999|isbn = 9781903018064|last1 = Walker|first1 = Harlan}}</ref>

A 10th century Arabic cookbook describes two types of ''kashk'', one made of wheat and leaven and another of sour milk. By the Middle Ages the word had two meanings, one referring to barley flour or a mix of barley and cracked wheat, and another to mean a meat or fowl dish cooked overnight (''kashak'' or kashba).<ref name=cooper>{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=John |title=Eat and be Satisfied: A Social History of Jewish Food |year=1993 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ld7fuK6peH8C&pg=PA44 |page=44|isbn=9780876683163 }}</ref>

==Preparation==
[[File:Fromage kyrghize.jpg|thumb|left|Preparation of qurut in [[Kyrgyz cuisine|Kyrgyzstan]]]]
To make the dried yogurt ''qurut'' a traditional or modern method can be used. For the modern method, sour yogurt is blended until smooth, then boiled and strained. It is left to ferment in a warm oven for several days, then the moisture is strained and blended with salt to make the ''kashk''. The drained liquid can be used to make ''qaraqurut'' ("dried black whey").<ref name=walker>{{cite book |last=Walker |first=Harlan |title=Milk-- beyond the dairy : proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery |date=1999 |page=70 |isbn=9781903018064 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tuor2vcVtiQC}}</ref>

For traditionally prepared ''qurut'' water is added to full fat yogurt and poured into a goatskin "churn" - a sack hung from a tripod that is swung back and forth until the milk separates into a type of butter and buttermilk. The buttermilk is boiled and drained to obtain [[curd]] which is dried in the sun over a period of weeks to make ''qurut''.<ref name=walker/> While traveling in the [[Baluchistan]] English explorer [[Ernest Ayscoghe Floyer]] encountered this form of ''kashk'':<ref>{{cite book |last=Floyer |first=Ernest Ayscoghe |title=Unexplored Baluchistan: a Survey, with Observations Astronomical, Geographical, Botanical, Etc. Of a Route Through Mekran, Bashkurd, Persia, Kurdistan and Turkey |url=https://archive.org/details/unexploredbaluc00floygoog |date=1882 |page=[https://archive.org/details/unexploredbaluc00floygoog/page/n290 265]}}</ref>
[[File:Kesk-meledi1.jpg|thumb|Kurdish women preparing kashk in a village in [[Turkish cuisine|Turkey]]]]
<blockquote>...from the butter manufacture is left the buttermilk called "[[Doogh|dōgh]]." This is boiled, and the remainder is "luch"; this is pressed and dried, and becomes "shilanch", or in Persian, "kashk," a hard, white biscuit of very sour cheese. This is powdered, and, boiled with savory herbs, is very palatable.
</blockquote>

When ''kashk'' is made with grain in the [[Armenian cuisine|Armenian]], [[Arab cuisine|Arab]] and [[Turkish cuisine]]s strained yogurt is added to grain and stored until it begins to ferment. After being left to dry in the sun for over a week it is turned into a coarse powder by rubbing and sifting.<ref name=guardian /><ref name=oxford441 />

==Regional cuisines==

=== Caucasus ===
''[[Matzoon]]'' in [[Armenian cuisine|Armenia]] and ''mats'oni'' in [[Georgian cuisine|Georgia]], is a commonly used ingredient in [[Caucasian cuisine]]. One of the ways ''matzoon'' is used is for the production of [[butter]]. When ''matsun'' is [[Churning (butter)|churned]] it separates from the buttermilk. By boiling and churning the buttermilk one obtains [[ricotta]] cheese. The product obtained by drying the ricotta clots is called ''chortan'';<ref name=fao>{{cite web | title=Gardens of Biodiversity.

In Azerbaijan, ''qurut'' is made in a similar way from strained yogurt. Yogurt (''[[qatiq]]'') is made from fresh [[milk]] and [[strained yogurt|strained]] to make ''[[suzma]] qatiq''. When the buttermilk "whey" has been separated from the butter using traditional methods the buttermilk curds are formed into small balls and dried in the sun.<ref name=guardian>{{cite book |title=Ferment to be: Yotam Ottolenghi's kashk recipes |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jul/19/kashk-kishk-recipes-yotam-ottolenghi |date=July 19, 2013}}</ref>

In western parts of Azerbaijan boiled flat dough is layered with a ''qurut'' white sauce and chicken to make [[Azerbaijani cuisine|Azerbaijani]] ''xəngəl''.

=== Central Asia ===
[[File:Kurutob Tajikistan.JPG|thumb|[[Qurutob]] from [[Tajik cuisine]]]]
Qurut dissolved in water is a primary ingredient of ''[[qurutob]]'', which is thought of by some as the national dish of [[Tajik cuisine|Tajikistan]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = The World Cookbook: The Greatest Recipes from Around the Globe, 2nd Edition [4 Volumes]: The Greatest Recipes from Around the Globe|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GmqEAwAAQBAJ|publisher = ABC-CLIO|date = 2014-01-15|isbn = 9781610694698|first1 = Jeanne|last1 = Jacob|first2 = Michael|last2 = Ashkenazi|page = 1342}}</ref> One of the main dishes in Afghanistan is ''kichree qurut'', made with [[mung beans]], [[rice]] and qurut dissolved in water.

===Iran===
[[File:Kashk.JPG|thumb|[[Iranian cuisine|Iranian]] kashk]]
Kashk has been a staple in the Iranian diet for thousands of years.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moraba|first=Kareh|date=2016|title=The Story of Kashk|journal=Gastronomica|volume=16|issue=4|pages=97–100|doi=10.1525/gfc.2016.16.4.97|url=https://online.ucpress.edu/gastronomica/article-abstract/16/4/97/44999/The-Story-of-Kashk |jstor=26362399 }}</ref> In modern Iran, kashk is a thick whitish liquid similar to [[whey]] or [[sour cream]], used in traditional [[Persian cuisine|Persian]] and [[Kurdish cuisine]], like [[ash reshteh]], [[kashk e badamjan]], ''kale joush''. It is available as a liquid or in a dried form, which needs to be soaked and softened before it can be used in cooking. Kashk was traditionally produced from the leftovers of cheese-making (more specifically, the milk used to make it). The procedure is, subtracting butter from milk, the remainder is [[doogh]] which can be used as the base for kashk. The water is subtracted from this whitish beverage and what remains is kashk which can be dried. Iranian kashk has made an appearance in US markets in the past half-century by several Iranian grocers starting with Kashk Hendessi.

===Turkey===
In [[Turkish cuisine|Turkey]], kashk is a dried yogurt product also known as ''keş peyniri'', ''kurut'', ''taş yoğurt'', ''kuru yoğurt'', or ''katık keşi''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Yurdakök |first=Murat |date=2013 |title=Yoğurdun öyküsü, probiyotiklerin tarihi |url=http://www.cshd.org.tr/csh/pdf/pdf_CSH_488.pdf |journal=Çocuk Sağlığı ve Hastalıkları Dergisi |publisher=Turkish National Pediatric Society |pages=46 |access-date=14 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216111935/http://www.cshd.org.tr/csh/pdf/pdf_CSH_488.pdf |archive-date=16 December 2014 }}/</ref> Its contents and production vary by region. In western and northern Turkey, especially in [[Bolu]], the product is categorized as a cheese owing to its shape and white color. In eastern Turkey, especially [[Erzincan]], [[Erzurum]], and [[Kars]], kurut is produced from skimmed yogurt made from the whey left over from production of butter by the ''yayık'' method,<ref>Karabulut I, Hayaloğlu AA, Yıldırım H. 2007. ''Thinlayer drying characteristics of kurut, a Turkish dried dairy by-product.'' Int J Food Sci Technol, 42, 1080–1086.</ref> and then crushed or rolled. In parts of southeastern Turkey with a significant Kurdish population, it is called ''keşk''. All versions of this dairy product are salty. It is used as an ingredient in soups, [[keşkek]], [[erişte]], etc.

There is also a closely related dried food product called [[tarhana]] which is based on a fermented mixture of grain and yogurt or fermented milk. It is very similar to ''kishk'' of the Levantine cuisine described below.

===Levant and Arabian Peninsula===
In [[Lebanese cuisine|Lebanon]], [[Jordan]], Arabian Peninsula, and [[Syrian cuisine|Syria]], ''kishk'' is a powdery cereal of [[bulgur|burghul]] (cracked wheat) fermented with milk and [[Leben (milk product)|laban]] (yogurt), usually from goat milk. It is easily stored and is valuable to the winter diet of isolated villagers or country people. Kishk is prepared in early autumn following the preparation of burghul. Milk, laban, and burghul are mixed well together and allowed to ferment for nine days. In Lebanon, the mix is salted and traditionally set to ferment in large clay jars for up to three weeks, during which it is regularly kneaded.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kanafani-Zahar|first=Aida |title=Mūne: la conservation alimentaire traditionnelle au Liban|date=1994|publisher=Editions de la Maison des sciences de l'homme|isbn=2-7351-0539-3|location=Paris|oclc=35808135}}</ref> Each morning the mixture is thoroughly kneaded with the hands. When fermentation is complete the kishk is spread on a clean cloth to dry, notably on the rooftops of rural dwellings.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Uvezian|first=Sonia |title=Recipes and remembrances from an eastern Mediterranean kitchen: a culinary journey through Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan|date=2012|isbn=978-0-9709716-9-2 |location=Northbrook, IL|oclc=1103919360}}</ref> Finally it is rubbed well between the hands until it is reduced to a powder, sieved, and then stored in a dry place. 

In Lebanese cuisine, ''kishk'' is commonly used to this day, mixed with tomato paste, as a topping for ''[[manakish]]'', a sort of flatbread cooked in an open oven and eaten for breakfast or a lunch. Traditionally, it would also be served with eggs, as a ''[[kibbeh]]'' stuffing, or in a soup, possibly with lamb meat fried in its own fat (''[[Kavurma|awarma]]'').<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kanafani-Zahar|first=Aida |title=Mūne : la conservation alimentaire traditionnelle au Liban|date=1994|publisher=Editions de la Maison des sciences de l'homme|isbn=2-7351-0539-3|location=Paris|oclc=35808135}}</ref> 

In [[Jordanian cuisine|Jordan]] a dried yogurt similar to kashk called [[jameed]] is commonly used. Elsewhere in the Levant, similar products are referred to as drained [[Labneh#Middle East|labneh]] (''labneh malboudeh'').

A 10th-century recipe for ''kishk'' recorded in the ''[[Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq|Kitab al-Tabikh]]'' was made by par-boiling dehulled wheat, milling it, and blending it with [[chickpea]] flour. Yeast, salt and water were added to make a dough from the flour, which was left in the sun for around 2 weeks, and re-moistened with sour yogurt (or sour [[grape juice]]) as needed. After 15 days the dough would be seasoned with mint, [[purslane]], cilantro, [[rue]], parsley, garlic and the leafy tops of [[Leek|leeks]], shaped into disks, and allowed to dry in the sun.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nasrallah |first=Nawal |title=Annals of the Caliphs' Kitchens |publisher=Brill |date=2007|pages=209–210}}</ref>
