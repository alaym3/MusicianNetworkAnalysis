==History==
===Formation (2011)===
Born in the [[List of islands in the Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] and raised in [[Orange County, California]] the members of Common Kings which consists of 'Jr. King' (Sasualei Maliga) on lead vocals, 'Mata' (Taumata Grey) on guitar, 'Uncle Lui' (Ivan Kirimaua) on bass, and 'Big Rome' (Jerome Taito) on drums, formed after forging a bond from a jam session at Ivan's house.<ref name="Kellman">Kellman, Andy "[https://www.allmusic.com/artist/common-kings-mn0003337546/biography Common Kings Biography]", [[Allmusic]]. Retrieved August 24, 2018</ref> 

Originally from Hawaii with Samoan roots, Sasualei Maliga, who has a three-octave range voice, met drummer Jerome Taito (from Samoa), bassist Ivan Kirimaua (from Fiji/[[Kirimaua]]) and guitarist Taumata Grey (from Tonga) when they were growing up in the Orange County towns of [[Cosa Mesa, CA|Costa Mesa]], [[Garden Grove, CA|Garden Grove]], and [[Irvine, CA|Irvine]], all through a close-knit O.C. Pacific-Islander community. The four met in 2002 during a barbecue at Kirimaua's beachfront house in [[Newport Beach, California]]. 

They formed the band while studying at [[Orange Coast College]] in [[Costa Mesa, California]], and began recording songs in 2011.

The band name pays tribute to their proud heritage and the love for their home lands of [[Fiji]], [[Hawaii]], [[Samoa]], and [[Tonga]] where their ancestry comes from royalty. So all members have ruling-class bloodlines.<ref name="Garcia">Garcia, David (2015) "[https://www.ocweekly.com/common-kings-became-oc-reggae-royalty-by-never-resting-on-their-laurels-6589886/ Common Kings Became OC Reggae Royalty By Never Resting on Their Laurels]", ''[[OC Weekly]]'', October 2, 2015. Retrieved August 24, 2018</ref> But they remind us that they're just "everyday guys" from Orange County, California living out their humble dreams. Common Kings developed a style of reggae with hints of rock and an island sound. Their songs feature an array of "head-rocking beats, feel good vibes, and emotional fever."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.commonkings.com/about|title=About}}</ref>
