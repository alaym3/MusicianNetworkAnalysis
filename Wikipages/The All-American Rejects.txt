==History==

===1999–2004: Formation and ''The All-American Rejects''===
{{Main|The All-American Rejects (album)}}
The band formed in [[Stillwater, Oklahoma]] in 1999 while members Nick Wheeler and [[Tyson Ritter]] were still in high school. It was here that Ritter offered himself for bass duties. Eventually Wheeler and Ritter decided to form the All-American Rejects.<ref name=SGtranslated/> When asked where the name came from, Mike Kennerty says, "It was a random name that sounded cool. I feel like we have grown into it over the years."<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/All-American-Rejects-guitarist-dishes-on-bands-name-Secret/36959.html|title = All-American Rejects guitarist dishes on band's name, 'Secret'|last = Nunn|first = Jerry|date = March 28, 2012|journal = Windy City Times|id = {{ProQuest|1011085927}}|access-date = February 25, 2020|archive-date = February 25, 2020|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200225191359/http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/All-American-Rejects-guitarist-dishes-on-bands-name-Secret/36959.html|url-status = live}}</ref>

In 2000, while still in high school, the group made a demo simply labeled ''The All-American Rejects'', with Nick Wheeler (drums), Tyson Ritter (vocals, bass), and Jesse Tabish (guitar, vocals). The demo CD was engineered, mixed and mastered by Wheeler. It was also managed by [[Alisa Ben]] at Half-A-Cup Entertainment. The demo is now commonly referred to as ''The Blue Disc'' or ''The Blue Album''. The CD consisted of twelve songs, a few of which would be included on the ''Same Girl, New Songs'' demo made in 2001. Jesse Tabish later split from the group and later became a member of the folk band [[Other Lives (band)|Other Lives]]. Ritter and Wheeler put together the ''[[Same Girl, New Songs]]'' EP, which was soon sent to independent [[Doghouse Records]], where an intern saved the disc from the trash, and revealed it to the label owner. The All-American Rejects were soon signed to a recording contract.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_pHvSyzdVLH8/Sfz8HLqoFCI/AAAAAAAAKOQ/Wx2TNZ5YE40/s1600-h/DSCF4132.JPG |title=3.bp.glogspot.com |publisher=3.bp.blogspot.com |access-date=2011-10-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708030416/http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_pHvSyzdVLH8/Sfz8HLqoFCI/AAAAAAAAKOQ/Wx2TNZ5YE40/s1600-h/DSCF4132.JPG |archive-date=2011-07-08 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2001, with producer Tim O'Heir, the band recorded their self-titled debut studio album, ''[[The All-American Rejects (album)|The All-American Rejects]]''. The album and its first single, "[[Swing, Swing]]", were released towards the end of 2002. The group began looking for additional members for a live act.<ref>[http://www.aversion.com/bands/interviews.cfm?interview=178] {{dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref> Edmond, Oklahoma resident Mike Kennerty joined on as rhythm guitarist soon before the album was released. Soon after, the band was having problems with drummer Tim Campbell. Campbell was later replaced by drummer Chris Gaylor, who knew and played in another band with Kennerty.<ref>{{cite journal

The group was then signed by [[DreamWorks Records]]. The band hit the road for eight shows in January, and DreamWorks issued a broader-scale distribution of the debut LP. The album peaked at No.&nbsp;25 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] Album chart. The single "Swing, Swing" was also re-issued, which peaked on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] at No.&nbsp;60 as well as No.&nbsp;8 on the ''Billboard'' [[Modern Rock Tracks]] [[Limbeck|chart]].<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the all-american rejects|chart=all}} |title=Billboard.com |publisher=Billboard.com |access-date=2011-10-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the all-american rejects|chart=Hot 100}} |title=Billboard.com |publisher=Billboard.com |access-date=2011-10-15}}</ref><ref name="billboard.com">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the all-american rejects|chart=Alternative Songs}} |title=Billboard.com |publisher=Billboard.com |access-date=2011-10-15}}</ref> The single "[[The Last Song (The All-American Rejects song)|The Last Song]]" was also released spring 2003, and climbed to No.&nbsp;29 on the ''Billboard'' [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart.<ref name="billboard.com" />

Early in 2003, the band went on tour as an opening act for [[CKY (band)|CKY]]. While several differing stories have occurred concerning the tour, they were kicked off the tour shortly after it began.

In Spring 2003, the All-American Rejects set out on their first headlining tour, called the ''Too Bad For Hell Tour''. In later 2003, the All-American Rejects released, ''[[Live from Oklahoma... The Too Bad for Hell DVD!]]'', their first live DVD – which was later certified Gold by the [[RIAA]]. During this time, they performed on the [[Vans Warped Tour]]. They would later be part of the lineup again in summer 2005. In November, the All-American Rejects joined the bands [[Motion City Soundtrack]] and [[Limbeck]] for six shows in the United Kingdom, the first date on the 16th, and the last on the 22nd.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.motioncitymemories.com/MCSTourDates2003.pdf |title=Motioncitymemories.com |access-date=2011-10-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007020827/http://www.motioncitymemories.com/MCSTourDates2003.pdf |archive-date=2011-10-07 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===2005–06: ''Move Along''===
{{Main|Move Along}}
In July 2005, the All-American Rejects released their second studio album, ''[[Move Along]]'', produced by [[Howard Benson]]. The album's first single, "[[Dirty Little Secret]]", was released that summer to radio stations.

[[File:All american rejects.jpg|thumb|left|The All-American Rejects performing on December 4, 2006]]
At the end of 2005, the All-American Rejects embarked on ''The Rise of the Fall Tour'' along with [[The Academy Is...]] and [[Rooney (band)|Rooney]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=94780 |title=The Academy Is...

In 2006, the second single and [[Move Along (The All-American Rejects song)|title track]] from ''Move Along'', was released. Within the first weeks after premiering their video, it had been on the ''[[Total Request Live]]'' countdown, hitting number-one four days in a row. The single did not chart on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] until almost six months after its release, in June. On March 15, 2006, the All-American Rejects began a tour of the United States that wrapped up on May 13, 2006. On May 25, the All-American Rejects performed at the first ever [[VH1 Rock Honors]], covering [[Def Leppard]]'s "[[Photograph (Def Leppard song)|Photograph]]". In July the band sent a [[promotional single]] from ''Move Along'', "[[Top of the World (The All-American Rejects song)|Top of the World]]" to modern rock radio. A music video was created for it from clips of the All-American Rejects on tour and in concert.

"[[Move Along (song)|Move Along]]" was also used to help promote [[Lego]] [[Bionicle]]'s ''Inika'' toy sets in the summer of 2006. The group also participated in a promotion for the sets called "Free the Band". The overall priority of the promotion was that the Rejects got kidnapped by the villainous Piraka whilst sailing on a yacht and people had to assist the Inika on finding and rescuing the band via the website 'freetheband.com'. A competition could also be entered where the winners would receive Bionicle and All-American Rejects merchandise alike.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biosector01.com/wiki/index.php/FreeTheBand.com |title=FreeTheBand.com - BIONICLEsector01 |publisher=Biosector01.com |date=2009-12-03 |access-date=2011-10-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928063823/http://www.biosector01.com/wiki/index.php/FreeTheBand.com |archive-date=2011-09-28 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In September 2006, a third headlining single, "[[It Ends Tonight]]", was released from ''Move Along''. The video debuted at No.&nbsp;10 on the VH1 Top 20 countdown. The video also peaked at No.&nbsp;2 on ''[[Total Request Live|TRL]]''.<ref>[http://www.lala.com/artist/The_All-American_Rejects/bio Lala.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219033958/http://www.lala.com/artist/The_All-American_Rejects/bio |date=February 19, 2009 }}</ref> Later in the year the All-American Rejects launched the ''Tournado'' tour in support of ''Move Along''. The tour kicked off at [[Hartford, Connecticut]] on October 27, and wrapped up at [[Champaign, Illinois]] on December 20.

That New Year's Eve, the All-American Rejects performed on a special on Las Vegas' Fremont Street, which also included the bands [[OK Go]], [[Five for Fighting]], [[Rock Star Supernova]], and [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]].

===2007–09: ''When the World Comes Down''===
{{Main|When the World Comes Down}}
The All-American Rejects began writing material for their third studio album in December 2006. The band also collaborated with composer [[Danny Elfman]] on "The Future Has Arrived", which was included on the soundtrack of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] film ''[[Meet the Robinsons]]''. The song was created in conjunction with the film's musical score.

On July 17, 2007 the All-American Rejects released their second live DVD, titled ''[[Tournado (The All-American Rejects album)|Tournado]]'', with content from the 2006 headlining tour of the same name. Also during the summer, they covered "Jack's Lament" from ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', which was featured on ''[[Nightmare Revisited]]''. The finished album version of the song "[[I Wanna (The All-American Rejects song)|I Wanna]]" appeared in the movie, ''[[The House Bunny]]'', which was released to theaters on August 22, 2008. Vocalist/bassist [[Tyson Ritter]] played a role in the film, and offered up "I Wanna" for the soundtrack.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0852713/|title=The House Bunny (2008)|author=MiamiHEATfan777|date=22 August 2008|work=IMDb|access-date=2018-06-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180713202905/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0852713/|archive-date=2018-07-13|url-status=live}}</ref>

On September 30, 2008 the first single from ''[[When the World Comes Down]]'', "[[Gives You Hell]]" was released. The All-American Rejects were inducted into the [[Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame]], and were awarded with "Rising Star".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/the-all-american-rejects/chart-history|title=The All-American Rejects|website=Billboard.com|access-date=2020-03-31|archive-date=2017-10-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017050906/http://www.billboard.com/music/the-all-american-rejects/chart-history|url-status=live}}</ref> "Gives You Hell" peaked at No.&nbsp;1 on Pop charts on billboard.com and also peaked No.&nbsp;1 on [[iTunes]] charts and No.&nbsp;5 most downloaded song of the 2009 year, and the No.&nbsp;1 most played song of the year 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsok.com/oklahoma-music-hall-of-fame-names-new-inductees/article/3280544|title=Discography The All-American Rejects|publisher=Australian-charts.com|access-date=2009-02-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425124305/http://newsok.com/oklahoma-music-hall-of-fame-names-new-inductees/article/3280544|archive-date=2009-04-25|url-status=live}}</ref>

The music video for "Gives You Hell" was released November fifth and reached number one on [[VH1]]'s Top 20 Countdown. On the sixth, in support of "[[Gives You Hell]]", the band started the ''Gives You Hell Tour'', which hit many small venues and clubs. Then, on the eighteenth "Mona Lisa (When the World Comes Down)", another song from the band's upcoming album, was released digitally on iTunes. In the first week of December, the album version of "Real World" was made available for download on Rock Band for the [[Xbox 360]]/[[PlayStation 3]].

Three years after the ''[[Move Along]]'' album was issued, the group released their third studio album, ''When the World Comes Down'' (produced by [[Eric Valentine]]), on December 16, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/09/03/all-american-rejects-title-new-lp-when-the-world-comes-down/|title=Oklahoma hall of fame to induct musicians Entertainment: The All-American Rejects will close out ceremony and concert|work=NewsOK|access-date=2009-03-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315071632/http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/09/03/all-american-rejects-title-new-lp-when-the-world-comes-down|archive-date=2009-03-15|url-status=dead}}</ref> After the ''Gives You Hell Tour'' wrapped up, the band embarked on a world tour until coming back to the states to start the ''I Wanna Rock Tour'', which hit many major venues in the United States.

In May 2009, the All-American Rejects released a second single in the United States, entitled "[[The Wind Blows (song)|The Wind Blows]]", which achieved moderate success. "[[I Wanna (The All-American Rejects song)|I Wanna]]" was released internationally on July 8 to Australia and the United Kingdom. Another song from ''[[When the World Comes Down]]'', In July, "Real World" was released as a promotional single in the United States, followed by "I Wanna" as a headliner. In late summer the All-American Rejects joined [[Weezer]], [[Fall Out Boy]] and [[Taking Back Sunday]] for the second half of the ''[[Blink-182 Reunion Tour]]''. On August 15, the All-American Rejects made history, performing alongside [[Hoobastank]], [[Raygun (band)|Raygun]], [[Boys Like Girls]], [[Pixie Lott]] and [[Kasabian]] as one of the live acts at Asia's very first [[MTV World Stage Live In Malaysia]] concert.<ref>MTV World Stage Live In Malaysia [https://web.archive.org/web/20090505161036/http://worldstage.mtvasia.com/ worldstage.mtvasia.com]</ref> This performance gained them recognition in Malaysia. ''When the World Comes Down'' soon sold over 15,000 digital and physical copies in the country. On August 21 the "I Wanna" single was issued to Austria and Germany.

In October 2009, the All-American Rejects were forced to cancel shows due to an injury to frontman Tyson Ritter. He performed from a wheelchair with his leg in a brace on September 27 during a show in Tampa, Florida, amid reports suggesting the singer had undergone knee surgery to remove a tumor that had been there for many months. Ritter's leg became infected, and he remained hospitalized for five days. Ritter made a full recovery in time to return to kick off the ''Battle Of The Bands Tour'' with Taking Back Sunday, with the first date at [[Michigan State University|MSU]] in Michigan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/rejects-cancel-shows-after-ritters-mysterious-injury_1117914|title=All American Rejects – Rejects Cancel Shows After Ritter's Mysterious Injury|publisher=[[Contactmusic.com]]|access-date=2009-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207131952/http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/rejects-cancel-shows-after-ritters-mysterious-injury_1117914|archive-date=2009-12-07|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7016575738?The%20All-American%20Rejects%20Cancel%20Shows%20Following%20Tyson%20Ritter%27s%20Injury|title=The All-American Rejects Cancel Shows Following Tyson Ritter's Injury|publisher=All Headline News|access-date=2009-10-03}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> At the end of 2009, Ritter suffered from alcohol abuse after ending a six-year relationship. Ritter's way of coping with this issue was to write and record music for the band's next album, ''Kids In The Street''.<ref>Lucy, Evan. "All the World's a Rage." A.P.Alternative Press 05 2012: 52-6.

The All-American Rejects announced that they will be performing their last show in support of ''When the World Comes Down'' at Hollywood, California on December 14. Since the date soon sold out, the band added a second date at the venue for the next day. However, the group played one more show at the "Jingle Bell Bash" in [[Seattle]] on December 19.

===2010–13: ''Kids in the Street''===
{{Main|Kids in the Street}}
In February 2010, the All-American Rejects performed live at the [[Vancouver Winter Olympic Games]] at the Whistler Medals Plaza. They also had [[DirecTV]] performances at [[Super Bowl XLIV]] and a special set aired in February. The band also wrote and recorded the song "The Poison" for the ''[[Almost Alice]]'' compilation, a collection of songs representing the 2010 [[Tim Burton]] film ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. From June 25 to July 18, the All-American Rejects toured the United States and Canada as part of the [[Warped Tour 2010]] festival.

Later that year, the band announced that they were working on a fourth studio album, which was planned to be released in early 2012. Songwriters Nick Wheeler and Tyson Ritter went on numerous writing retreats into secluded parts of the United States; a tradition of writing used on their previously released albums. Recording for the album wrapped up in June 2011, with mixing commencing the following August and concluding early September. On November 14, 2011 Ritter announced that ex [[Taking Back Sunday]] bassist [[Matt Rubano]] had joined the band as their bass player for live performances, but stated that [Ritter] is still the bass player recording-wise.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/tysonritter/status/135876882838200320 |title=Tyson Ritter Twitter post announcing Matt Rubano as Bassist |access-date=2011-11-14 |archive-date=2018-10-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181025193346/https://twitter.com/tysonritter/status/135876882838200320 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet|user=tysonritter|author=Tyson ritteR|number=135960234882629632|date=14 November 2011|title=Yes, I am the oNLY one that will ever play bass on our records.-- @Tomellott @tysonritter Did you still play bass on the album?}}</ref>

On December 3, 2011, the group announced that the album will be titled ''[[Kids in the Street]]'' and released the song "Someday's Gone" from the album as a free download from their official website, a music video for the track that was filmed over the previous weekend also premiered the same day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.radio1045.com/pages/stephen.html?article=9472291 |title=The All-American Rejects release new song/ music video "Someday's Gone" |access-date=2011-12-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516181529/http://www.radio1045.com/pages/stephen.html?article=9472291 |archive-date=2012-05-16 }}</ref> The band later announced the track listing for the album on December 16, 2011, and that its first single would be titled "[[Beekeeper's Daughter]]", it premiered in an episode of American teen drama ''[[90210 (TV Series)|90210]]'' featuring the band performing the track on January 31, 2012, as well as being released the same day.<ref name="AAR">{{Cite web | url=http://www.allamericanrejects.com/news/default.aspx?nid=37686&aid=435 | title=Beekeeper's Daughter | publisher=All American Rejects | access-date=14 January 2012 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The album spawned two further singles; "[[Kids in the Street (song)|Kids in the Street]]" and "[[Heartbeat Slowing Down]]", both of which achieved little success in the US.

The All-American Rejects later embarked on their ''Shaking Off the Rust'' tour, which began in [[San Luis Obispo, California]], United States on January 18, 2012 and continued through the year - some of which they performed as a support act for [[Blink-182]]'s [[20th Anniversary Tour (Blink-182)|20th Anniversary Tour]] in the UK - and ended on July 27, 2013. The band performed at Sepang International Center in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia on September 27, 2013 alongside [[The Wanted]] and [[Five for Fighting]] as part of the [[Arthur's Day]] celebrations promoted by the [[Guinness]] brewing company.

It was later announced on July 10, 2019 that [[Epitaph Records]] had signed the band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/epitaphrecords/status/1149009037461245952?s=21|title=SEND HER TO HEAVEN &#124; 07/16 @therejectspic.twitter.com/TSoxk8N8Fl|first=Epitaph|last=Records|date=July 10, 2019|access-date=July 10, 2019|archive-date=December 17, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201217055157/https://twitter.com/epitaphrecords/status/1149009037461245952?s=21|url-status=live}}</ref> On the following July 16, The All-American Rejects released the 3-track single "[[Send Her to Heaven (The All-American Rejects song)|Send Her to Heaven]]", followed by its music video.

On August 21, 2020, the band released a 14 song collection to Spotify titled 'Rejects Faves' that contains band-picked favorites from their four studio albums. <ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=August 24, 2020|title=Rejects Faves Reviews|url=https://www.deadpress.co.uk/album-review-the-all-american-rejects-rejects-faves/|access-date=|website=}}</ref>

On November 30, 2020, in an interview with RADIO.COM, Tyson Ritter stated that “it’s not going to be very likely that [they] are going to do another record anytime soon if ever, it’s given birth to these other projects that [Ritter] started”, adding that “as an artist or as a songwriter you need to know when to stop.” <ref>{{cite web

Using mainly [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] and [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] guitars, the All-American Rejects use numerous models. The band uses [[Sennheiser]] microphones, [[Dean Markley Custom light's]] guitar strings, and [[Dunlop Manufacturing|Dunlop]] Picks.
Lead vocalist/bassist Tyson Ritter uses two models of [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]]; one is a Black P-Bass, and the other model is the then-discontinued [[Fender Jaguar Bass|Jaguar Bass]]. Ritter also uses Gibson models, including the [[Gibson Thunderbird]] and the [[Epiphone]] [[Flying V]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fender.com/artists/artist.php?id=238 |title=Fender.com |publisher=Fender Support |access-date=2011-10-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007034634/http://www.fender.com/artists/artist.php?id=238 |archive-date=2011-10-07 }}</ref>

The lead guitarist of the All-American Rejects, Nick Wheeler, primarily uses Gibson guitars. Wheeler's main guitar is the [[Gibson Firebird]]. He primarily uses a Vintage Sunburst Firebird V. Wheeler owns a rare cherry Firebird VII, which he no longer uses for live shows, as well as a custom Firebird, which is painted in blue glitter. He owns eight Firebirds overall. He also uses a Classic Gibson Firebird. Wheeler frequently uses a [[Gibson ES-335]]. This guitar is notably used live for the intro of "Top of the World", taking the place of the [[classical guitar]] originally used in the "Top of the World" recording. It is also commonly used in the songs "It Ends Tonight", "Real World", "Stab My Back", "My Paper Heart", "Gives You Hell" and "Dance Inside". Another guitar that Wheeler favors is the [[Gibson EDS-1275]] [[doubleneck]] guitar, which he uses live on "The Wind Blows".
