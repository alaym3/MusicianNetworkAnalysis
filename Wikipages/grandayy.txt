Grandayy graduated as a [[physician]]<ref name="lovinmalta"/><ref name="tvm"/> but has been focused on [[YouTube]] since 2011.<ref>{{cite web |last=Demarco |first=Joanna|date=2018-02-14 |title=From graduating as a doctor, to working as a full-time Youtuber |url=https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2018-02-16/local-news/From-graduating-as-a-doctor-to-working-as-a-full-time-Youtuber-6736184919 |work= The Independent|access-date=2019-12-26 }}</ref> He uploaded his first videos in 2007 on his original channel grande1899.

Grandayy suggested the concept of "Minecraft Monday" and convinced [[Keemstar]], a YouTube news reporter, to host the event. The event included [[PewDiePie]] and [[James Charles (Internet personality)|James Charles]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Hernandez|first=Patricia |date=2019-08-01 |title=Minecraft is having a big comeback in 2019 |url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/1/20727946/minecraft-youtube-popularity-memes-pewdiepie-grandayy-keemstar-minecraft-monday |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|access-date=2019-12-26 }}</ref>

==Political views==
Grandayy has been an outspoken opponent of [[Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market#Draft Article 13 (Directive Article 17)|Article 13]] and believed the law could "kill the internet", warning that all broadcasters could face censorship from automated bots.<ref>{{cite web |last=Vella|first=Matthew |date=2019-03-23 |title=Malta's biggest Youtuber's impassioned plea on why EU copyright law 'could kill Internet' |url=https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/93809/watch_maltas_biggest_youtubers_impassioned_plea_on_why_eu_copyright_law_could_kill_internet |work=Malta Today |access-date=2019-12-26 }}</ref> He said "The sad thing is that us YouTubers have no lobby groups or unions that can fight for us and speak to politicians directly for us. Most politicians have no idea about the troubles YouTubers face with copyright, or what type of content the typical YouTuber even produces".<ref name="TheVerge">{{cite web |last=Alexander|first=Julia |date=2019-03-17 |title=YouTube creators are still trying to fight back against European copyright vote |url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/27/18283800/youtube-copyright-directive-article-13-memes-grandayy-philip-defranco-european-union |work=[[The Verge]] |access-date=2019-12-26 }}</ref>
