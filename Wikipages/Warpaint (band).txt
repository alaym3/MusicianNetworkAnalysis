'''Warpaint''' is an American [[indie rock]] band from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], formed in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/warpaint/51556/|title=Warpaint reveal their Valentine's Day secret – video &#124; News|work=[[NME]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|date=June 17, 2010|access-date=November 25, 2010}}</ref> The band consists of [[Emily Kokal]] (vocals, guitar), [[Theresa Wayman]] (vocals, guitar), [[Jenny Lee Lindberg]] (bass, vocals), and [[Stella Mozgawa]] (drums).

To date, the band has released three studio albums: ''[[The Fool (Warpaint album)|The Fool]]'' (2010), ''[[Warpaint (Warpaint album)|Warpaint]]'' (2014), and ''[[Heads Up (Warpaint album)|Heads Up]]'' (2016).

==History==
===Beginning and formation (2004–2007)===
Warpaint formed in Los Angeles on [[Valentine's Day]] 2004. The original lineup consisted of childhood friends Wayman and Kokal alongside sisters Lindberg and [[Shannyn Sossamon]]. The band played in the Los Angeles area for three years, writing songs ("Stars", "Beetles" and "Elephants") which would eventually comprise their debut EP.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

===''Exquisite Corpse'' (2007–2009)===
The band began recording their debut EP, ''[[Exquisite Corpse (EP)|Exquisite Corpse]]'', in December 2007, with producer Jacob Bercovici. The sessions took over two months and concluded with mixing and mastering by [[John Frusciante]], who was also Kokal's boyfriend at the time. Warpaint self-released the EP in 2008, which quickly moved to No. 1 on the Los Angeles [[Amoeba Records]] local artist chart. In 2009, ''Exquisite Corpse'' was rereleased worldwide by [[Manimal Vinyl]], to critical acclaim. The song "Elephants" featured in the 2011 independent [[horror film]] ''Siren'', directed by [[Andrew Hull]] and released by [[Lionsgate]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Current [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] guitarist [[John Frusciante]] mixed and mastered ''Exquisite Corpse''. Former RHCP guitarist [[Josh Klinghoffer]] performed drums and guitar on the EP in 2007.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Australian drummer Mozgawa (formerly of Mink and [[Swahili Blonde]]) joined the band in the winter of 2009. Shortly afterwards, Warpaint were signed to [[Rough Trade Records]], and immediately began extensive touring throughout the United States and Europe, including an opening slot for [[the xx]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/39234-the-xx-announce-fall-tour/|title=The xx Announce Fall Tour &#124; News|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|last=Dombal|first=Ryan|date=June 22, 2010|access-date=September 25, 2010}}</ref>

On December 6, 2010, the [[BBC]] announced that Warpaint had been nominated for the BBC's [[Sound of... (BBC poll)|Sound of 2011]] poll and they were the cover stars of ''Beat'' magazine's Winter 2010 launch issue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebeatjuice.com/news/view/20/1/warpaint/|title=Warpaint!|work=BEAT Magazine|last=Hanra|first=Hanna|date=December 15, 2010|access-date=February 26, 2011}}</ref>

As early as 2011, drummer Mozgawa, in an interview with ''NME'', expressed the band's intention to "experiment and write with one another" as the current lineup had never composed songs "from the ground up" together. Bassist Lindberg further indicated that most of the newer songs were written by "just jam[ming] and free-flow[ing] onstage".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/warpaint/59380/|title= Watch Warpaint's Rough Trade Sessions – video|work=[[NME]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|date=September 22, 2011|access-date=November 29, 2013}}</ref> In February 2013, Wayman confirmed to ''NME'' that the band intended to create a minimalist sound on ''Warpaint'', revealing that the band developed songs at soundchecks, and experimented more with acoustic guitars and percussion instruments on the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/warpaint/68638|title= Warpaint confirm work on second album |work=[[NME]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|date=February 11, 2013|access-date=November 29, 2013}}</ref> Lead vocalist Kokal noted that [[R&B]] and [[rap music]] were influences on Warpaint and stated that the album featured "things that have drum machines and ambience, music that's more than standard rock". Kokal added that the album was largely keyboards-based, which contributed to the overall sound being "definitely different" from the band's previous album, ''The Fool''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/warpaint/73516|title= Warpaint reveal rap and R&B influence on new album |work=[[NME]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|date=October 30, 2013|access-date=November 29, 2013}}</ref>

On November 20, Warpaint performed "Composure," from ''The Fool'', as well as new songs "Love Is to Die" and "Keep It Healthy", on [[BBC 6|BBC 6 Music]] with [[Steve Lamacq]] in the U.K. The next day, an article from the December 2013 issue of ''[[Dazed & Confused (magazine)|Dazed & Confused]]'' magazine appeared online, providing insight into the making of the new album, as well as the accompanying documentary, filmed by Lindberg's husband, [[video artist]] [[Chris Cunningham]] (the subject of the song "CC").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/17912/1/war-games|title= War Games|work=[[Dazed Digital]]|publisher=[[Dazed & Confused (magazine)|Dazed & Confused]]|access-date=November 29, 2013|date= 2013-11-21}}</ref> Lindberg later confirmed in a November 24 interview on [[XFM]] that Cunningham's documentary would be made available shortly after the album's release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xfm.co.uk/radio/communion-presents/highlights/communion-presents-24-november-2013/|title= Communion Presents|publisher=[[XFM]]|access-date=November 29, 2013}}</ref>

A music video, composed of a two-song vignette from the second album—"Disco//very" and "Keep it Healthy"—was released in April 2014.
