On 1 December 2009, Jónsi's official website, jonsi.com, was launched in anticipation of his debut solo album, ''[[Go (Jónsi album)|Go]]'', which was released on 5 April 2010. After the release of the album, Jónsi promptly started a tour across North America and Europe, featuring songs from the album plus a few other selections, planning to tour from March to September. A decade would pass before Jónsi would release his second studio album, ''[[Shiver (Jónsi album)|Shiver]]'', which was released on October 2, 2020. He would release his third album ''Obsidian'' a year later in conjunction with the exhibit of the same name.

In late January 2010, Jónsi announced that Sigur Rós was on "an indefinite hiatus", as the band had scrapped plans for a new album previously announced to be released in 2010, saying that "they were just rumours". The band decided to take the year off, as several members of Sigur Rós recently had children, and as Jónsi developed his solo career.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/news/?p=1496 |title=Sigur Rós Official Site News |access-date=5 February 2010}}</ref> In 2012, the band reformed and released the album ''[[Valtari]]'' in May 2012 and subsequently ''[[Kveikur]]'' in June 2013.

==Musical career==
When Jónsi was 13 years old, he learned his first song on guitar, "Wrathchild" by [[Iron Maiden]]. Iron Maiden remains one of his favorite bands to this day.<ref name="sigur rós – trivia">{{cite web |url=http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/band/trivia.php |title=sigur rós – trivia |access-date=8 March 2009 |work=sigur-ros.co.uk}}</ref> In 1995, Jónsi fronted a band called Bee Spiders, under the [[Stage name|alias]] 'Jonny B'. He wore [[sunglasses]] on stage throughout their concerts. Bee Spiders received the 'most interesting band' award in 1995 in a contest for unknown bands called ''Músíktilraunir'' (''Music Experimentations''). The band played long rock songs and was compared to [[The Smashing Pumpkins]].<ref name="sigur rós – trivia"/> Jónsi also fronted a [[grunge]] band called Stoned around 1992–1993. He also uses the alias '''Frakkur''' to release his solo material, e.g., the contribution to ''[[Kitchen Motors Family Album]]'', which marked the first release under this name.

Since 1994, Jónsi has been the singer and guitarist for [[Sigur Rós]]. To date, they have released seven studio albums.

Aside from his many years with Sigur Rós, Jónsi has collaborated with his ex-partner [[Alex Somers]]<ref name=sfchron>{{Cite news |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-04-04/entertainment/20833823_1_sigur-r-s-band-s-music-stage |title=Sigur Rós singer prepares for U.S. solo tour |date=4 April 2010 |access-date=14 April 2010 |periodical=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |first=Aidin |last=Vaziri }}</ref> under the [[moniker]] [[Jónsi & Alex]], releasing their album ''[[Riceboy Sleeps]]'' in 2009. In April 2010, Jónsi released his first solo album, ''[[Go (Jónsi album)|Go]]'', and began a multi-nation tour to promote the album from March through September across North America and Europe.

Jónsi's song "Around Us" was used for the American promotional trailer for [[Studio Ghibli]]'s film ''[[Arrietty|The Secret World of Arriety]]'' and was also included in ''[[FIFA 11]]'', the soundtrack by [[EA Sports]].

His song "Tornado" was featured in Henry Alex Rubin's 2012 film ''[[Disconnect (2012 film)|Disconnect]]''.

Jónsi also wrote the score for the 2012 [[Cameron Crowe]] film ''[[We Bought a Zoo]]''.
  
"Boy Lilikoi" and instrumental versions of "Tornado", "Sinking Friendships", and "Around Us" were all included in the 2011 documentary ''[[This Is What Love in Action Looks Like]]''.

Jónsi's song "Grow Till Tall" was used by the [[Bluecoats Drum and Bugle Corps]] in their 2017 competitive program ''Jagged Line.'' It was also featured in the trailer for the third installment of the ''[[The Divergent Series|Divergent]]'' series, ''[[The Divergent Series: Allegiant|Allegiant]]''.

In 2018, Jonsi contributed an original song titled "Who Are You Thinking Of?" to the soundtrack of the feature film ''[[Boy Erased]]''. He collaborated with [[Troye Sivan]] on the song "[[Revelation (Troye Sivan and Jónsi song)|Revelation]]", also included on the soundtrack.

===''How to Train Your Dragon'' franchise===
Jónsi recorded "Sticks and Stones" for the score to the 2010 film ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'',<ref>{{cite web|last=Richardson|first=Matthew|date=3 March 2010|title=Jonsi Stars in New Documentary, Does Song For 'How To Train Your Dragon' (Video)|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/news/jonsi-stars-in-new-documentary-does-song-for-how-t/38194/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613201719/http://www.prefixmag.com/news/jonsi-stars-in-new-documentary-does-song-for-how-t/38194/|archive-date=13 June 2011|access-date=20 May 2010|website=Prefixmag.com}}</ref> for which [[DreamWorks Animation]] released a music video on 17 December 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXV2fCimTsE|title = Jonsi's "Sticks and Stones" Music Video|author = DreamWorks Animation|via = YouTube|date = 17 December 2010}}</ref> His song "Tornado" was featured in the arena show adaptation of this film. In 2014, Jónsi co-wrote the song "Where No One Goes" for the sequel, ''[[How to Train Your Dragon 2]]'', with the film's music composer [[John Powell (film composer)|John Powell]]. He also co-wrote the melody for "For the Dancing and Dreaming". Jónsi additionally wrote a rough demo (entitled "Mama's Boy") for the film, which was eventually replaced by "Flying with Mother". He wrote and performed the song "Together from Afar" for the final installment of the franchise, ''[[How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World]]'', in which he also provided the vocals for the track "The Hidden World".

===Dark Morph===
In 2019, it was announced that Jónsi and Swedish composer [[Carl Michael von Hausswolff]] had formed a new musical collaboration they were calling Dark Morph, and on 10 May 2019, they released their first album, also titled ''Dark Morph''. The project "promises to explore the ramifications of ongoing environmental collapse to the oceans and its inhabitants."<ref>{{cite web|last=Bote|first=Joshua|date=1 May 2019|title=Inspired By Environmental Crisis, Sigur Rós' Jónsi Announces New Duo Dark Morph|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/05/01/719098300/inspired-by-environmental-crisis-sigur-r-s-j-nsi-announces-new-duo-dark-morph|access-date=26 June 2019|website=NPR}}</ref> The album consists mainly of ambient sounds, often simulating the sounds of animals and nature, and contains very few actual melodies.

==Studio albums==

===''Riceboy Sleeps'' (2009)===
Jónsi and his ex-partner [[Alex Somers]] completed their first album together, ''[[Riceboy Sleeps]]'', under the name [[Jónsi & Alex]]. The instrumental album was recorded in Iceland, played solely on acoustic instruments, and mixed in Hawaii. The album features appearances by the Icelandic string quartet [[Amiina]] and the Kópavogsdætur choir.<ref>{{cite web |title=eighteen seconds before sunrise – sigur rós news |url=http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/news/?m=20090417 |date=17 April 2009 |work=sigur-ros.co.uk |access-date=2 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606160613/http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/news/?m=20090417 |archive-date=6 June 2011  }}</ref>

[[File:Jónsi - Ferrara 22-07-2010.jpg|right|thumb|Jónsi live in Ferrara (22 July 2010)]]

A post that appeared on Jónsi's official site on 26 May 2009 stated that the artist was working on a solo album that would feature predominantly acoustic music and string arrangements from classical composer [[Nico Muhly]]. The album was set to be produced by [[Peter Katis]] ([[Interpol (band)|Interpol]], [[The National (band)|The National]], [[Tokyo Police Club]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/news/?p=1307 |title=jónsi recording solo album |access-date=9 June 2009}}</ref>

On 4 December 2009, a free MP3 of the track "Boy Lilikoi" was made available to mailing-list subscribers through the website. The MP3 announced the title of the album to be ''[[Go (Jónsi album)|Go]]'' and gave a worldwide release date of "the week of 5 April 2010" through [[Parlophone]] and [[XL Recordings]].

On 5 April 2010, as promised, the album was released in Iceland and the United Kingdom, with a worldwide release date of the following day. The album was sung mainly in English, marking a change from the majority of Jónsi's previous work, which was sung mainly in Icelandic and [[Vonlenska]]. The album charted at No. 20 on the UK album charts on 12 April 2010<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/chart/albums/ |title=UK top 40 albums 12 APR 2010}}</ref> and reached No. 23 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

The ''Go'' limited-edition box set also included ''[[Go Quiet]]'', a 45-minute film, directed by [[Dean DeBlois]] (director of the Sigur Rós concert film ''[[Heima]]''), that features all nine songs from the album performed acoustically at home in Reykjavík, over New Year 2010.

Jónsi went on tour with his album ''[[Go (Jónsi album)|Go]]'' on 6 April 2010. The tour did not include any venues within Jónsi's home country of Iceland. The artist's touring band included Alex Somers on guitar, sound effects, and keyboards; Thorvaldur Thór Thorvaldsson on drums; [[Stórsveit Nix Noltes|Ólafur Björn Ólafsson]] on keyboards; and [[klive|Úlfur Hansson]] on bass and [[monome]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Tour Diary No. 2|url=http://jonsi.com/news/tour-diary-2|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803113854/http://jonsi.com/news/tour-diary-2|archive-date=3 August 2016|access-date=26 May 2010|website=jonsi.com}}</ref>

=== ''Shiver'' (2020) ===
Jónsi would go a decade without releasing any solo material. On 3 April 2020, Jónsi took to Instagram to announce that he was releasing music later that month,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Jónsi on Instagram: "🎹I'm releasing new music later this month 🎹 follow me on @spotify and @youtube for updates via the link in my bio"|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B-e-ljMhEA4/|access-date=2020-08-10|website=Instagram|language=en}}</ref> which would be the lead single, "Exhale", to his second studio album, ''[[Shiver (Jónsi album)|Shiver]]'', with an accompanying music video directed by Jónsi and [[Giovanni Ribisi]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Tan|first=Emily|date=2020-04-23|title=Jónsi Makes Epic Return With 'Exhale' Video|url=https://www.spin.com/2020/04/jonsi-makes-epic-returns-with-exhale-video/|access-date=2020-08-10|website=Spin}}</ref>

The album was made in collaboration with English music producer, singer and head of record label [[PC Music]], [[A. G. Cook]]. Jónsi had no expectation for his and Cook's initial meeting, but the more they talked, the more he realized they might be perfect collaborators.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Shiver, by Jónsi|url=https://jonsi.bandcamp.com/album/shiver|access-date=2020-08-10|website=Jónsi}}</ref>

Jónsi released another single, "Swill", for the album on 24 June 2020, with an accompanying music video directed by Barnaby Roper.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ewing|first=Jerry|date=25 June 2020|title=Sigur Rós frontman Jónsi releases video for new single Swill|url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/sigur-ros-frontman-jonsi-releases-video-for-new-single-swill|access-date=2020-08-10|website=Prog Magazine|language=en}}</ref>

==Languages==
[[File:Jonsi.jpg|thumb|Jónsi at [[UCLA]], playing to promote ''Heima'']]
Jónsi's first language is [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]. He also speaks English, according to the official Sigur Rós website:<ref name="interview">{{cite web |url=http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/|title=Sigur Rós Official Site |access-date=12 May 2007}}</ref> 
<blockquote>On the first three Sigur Rós albums (Von, Von Brigði, Ágætis Byrjun), Jónsi sang most songs in Icelandic but two of them ("Von" and "Olsen Olsen") were sung in '[[Vonlenska|Hopelandic]]'. All of the vocals on ( ) are in Hopelandic. Hopelandic (''Vonlenska'' in Icelandic) is the 'invented language' in which Jónsi sings before lyrics are written to the vocals. It is not an actual language by definition (no vocabulary, grammar, etc.), but rather a form of gibberish vocals that fit to the music and act as another instrument. Jónsi likens it to what singers sometimes do when they've decided on the melody, but haven't written the lyrics yet. Many languages were considered to be used on ( ), including English, but they decided on Hopelandic. Hopelandic (Vonlenska) got its name (from a journalist, not Jónsi himself) from the first song which Jónsi sang on, "Hope" (Von).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gorillavsbear.net/2007/10/sigur-ros-vs-npr.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120713234343/http://gorillavsbear.net/2007/10/sigur-ros-vs-npr.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-13 |title=sigur ros vs. NPR |publisher=gorillavsbear.net |date=2007-10-12 |access-date=2012-02-29 }}</ref></blockquote>

==Instruments==
Like a few other players of the [[bowed guitar]], Jónsi plays mainly variations of the [[Gibson Les Paul|Les Paul]].<ref name="soundonsound">{{cite web|url=http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/board/viewthread.php?tid=16846#pid323341|title=Sound on Sound on Sigur Ros Official Site|access-date=25 March 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709062804/http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/board/viewthread.php?tid=16846#pid323341|archive-date=9 July 2009}}</ref> He also plays Ibanez Les Paul copies, model PF200. The first Ibanez used to be his main instrument during the Bee Spiders era all through ''Ágætis Byrjun''. It was largely refinished and decorated (as can be seen in ''Ágúst Jakobsson's'' documentary ''Popp í Reykjavík''<ref name="Popp í Reykjavík">{{cite web |url=http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/band/disco/poppimg.php|title=Popp í Reykjavík Stills on Sigur Ros Official Site|access-date=9 June 2010}}</ref>). That particular instrument got stolen and broken but was on display in the [[Reykjavik Art Museum|Reykjavík Art Museum]] in the summer of 2003.<ref name="Morgunbladid">{{cite web|date=14 June 2003|title=Óformleg klippimynd af Smekkleysu|url=http://www.mbl.is/mm/gagnasafn/grein.html?grein_id=736520|access-date=9 June 2010|website=mbl.is|language=is}}</ref> During the recordings of ''[[Takk...]]'', Jónsi bought another PF200 to replace the Les Paul. Since the summer of 2006, Jónsi has been using a guitar that was made on the road by his then guitar tech Dan Johnson. The guitar is usually referred to as "The Bird", after the band's bird designs seen on previous album artwork that adorn the neck and frets of the guitar. "The Bird" is based on the body of the Ibanez PF200. The artist has also been seen playing a variety of other instruments such as the piano, acoustic guitar, electric bass guitar, harmonium, mellotron, baritone ukulele, and the banjo.

==Activism==
In 2003, he was escorted off the premises while protesting against [[Kárahnjúkar Hydropower Plant]] in Iceland.<ref name="sigur-ros.co.uk">{{cite web |url=http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/news/?m=200301 |title=Sigur Rós Official Site |date= January 2003|access-date=19 November 2008}}</ref>

Jónsi is a vegetarian. He states that he "didn't go vegetarian because of the animals" but became gradually more concerned for their welfare.<ref name="veget">{{cite web |url=http://www.vivaactivists.org.uk/celebs/interview-sigur-ros.php|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108064901/http://www.vivaactivists.org.uk/celebs/interview-sigur-ros.php|archive-date=8 November 2010 |title=Tonight, I sing for the animals|first1=Fiona |last1=Galbraith|first2=Kate|last2=Montgomery |publisher=[[Vegetarians' International Voice for Animals|Viva!

==Visual arts==
Alongside his visual art collaboration with [[Alex Somers]], he has also exhibited his own work. He had an installation at the Los Angeles branch of [[Tanya Bonakdar Gallery]] in late 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tanyabonakdargallery.com/exhibitions/jonsi/installations |title=November 16, 2019 – January 9, 2020 – - Jónsi – - Exhibitions – Tanya Bonakdar Gallery |work=tanyabonadkargallery.com |publisher=[[Tanya Bonadkar Gallery]]}}</ref>
