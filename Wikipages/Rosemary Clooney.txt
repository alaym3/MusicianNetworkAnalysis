'''Rosemary Clooney''' (May 23, 1928 – June 29, 2002) was an American singer and actress. She came to prominence in the early 1950s with the song "[[Come On-a My House]]", which was followed by other pop numbers such as "[[Botch-a-Me (Ba-Ba-Baciami Piccina)|Botch-a-Me]]", "[[Mambo Italiano (song)|Mambo Italiano]]", "[[Tenderly]]", "[[Half as Much]]", "[[Hey There]]", and "[[This Ole House]]". She also had success as a jazz vocalist. Clooney's career languished in the 1960s, partly due to problems related to depression and drug addiction, but revived in 1977, when her ''[[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]]'' co-star [[Bing Crosby]] asked her to appear with him at a show marking his 50th anniversary in show business. She continued recording until her death in 2002.

==Early life==
[[File:JohnBrettRichesonHouse.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Brett Richeson House]] in Maysville]]
Rosemary Clooney was born in [[Maysville, Kentucky]], the daughter of Marie Frances (née Guilfoyle) and Andrew Joseph Clooney. She was one of five children.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/01/arts/rosemary-clooney-legendary-pop-singer-dies-at-74.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|title=Rosemary Clooney, Legendary Pop Singer, Dies at 74|author=Severo, Richard|work=The New York Times|date=July 1, 2012|access-date=December 31, 2012}}</ref> Her father was of Irish and German descent, and her mother was of English and Irish ancestry. She was raised Catholic. When Clooney was 15, her mother and brother [[Nick Clooney|Nick]] moved to California. Her sister [[Betty Clooney|Betty]] and she remained with their father.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintagemusic.fm/artist/12486/|title=ROSEMARY CLOONEY|website=Vintage Music|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref> The family resided in the [[John Brett Richeson House]] in the late 1940s.

Rosemary and Betty became entertainers, whereas Nick became a newsman and television broadcaster (some of her children, including [[Miguel Ferrer]] and Rafael Ferrer, and her nephew, [[George Clooney]], also became respected actors and entertainers). In 1945, the Clooney sisters won a spot on [[Cincinnati]]'s radio station [[WLW]] as singers. Her sister Betty sang in a duo with Rosemary for much of the latter's early career.

==Career==

Clooney's first recordings, in May 1946, were for [[Columbia Records]]. She sang with [[Tony Pastor (bandleader)|Tony Pastor]]'s [[big band music|big band]]. Clooney continued working with the Pastor band until 1949, making her last recording with the band in May of that year and her first as a solo artist a month later, still for Columbia. In 1950–51, she was a regular on the radio and television versions of ''Songs For Sale'' on CBS. In 1951, her record of "Come On-a My House", produced by [[Mitch Miller]], became a hit. It was her first of many singles to hit the charts—despite the fact that Clooney hated the song passionately. She had been told by Columbia Records to record the song, and that she would be in violation of her contract if she did not do so. Clooney recorded several duets with [[Marlene Dietrich]] and appeared in the early 1950s on ''[[Faye Emerson's Wonderful Town]]'' series on [[CBS]]. Clooney also did several guest appearances on the [[Arthur Godfrey]] radio show, when it was sponsored by Lipton Tea. They did duets as he played his [[ukulele]], and other times, she would sing one of her latest hits.

[[File:Clooney White Christmas.png|thumb|Clooney in ''White Christmas'']]
In 1954, she starred, along with Bing Crosby, [[Danny Kaye]], and [[Vera-Ellen]], in the movie ''White Christmas''. She starred, in 1956, in a half-hour [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] television musical-[[variety show]], ''The Rosemary Clooney Show'', which featured [[The Hi-Lo's]] singing group and [[Nelson Riddle]]'s orchestra. The following year, the show moved to [[NBC]] prime time as ''[[Lux (soap)|The Lux Show]] Starring Rosemary Clooney'', but lasted only one season. The new show featured the singing group [[The Modernaires]] and [[Frank DeVol]]'s orchestra. In later years, Clooney often appeared with Bing Crosby on television, such as in the 1957 special ''[[The Edsel Show]]'', and the two friends made a concert tour of Ireland together. On November 21, 1957, she appeared on NBC's ''[[The Ford Show|The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford]]'', a frequent entry in the "Top 20" and featuring a musical group called "The Top Twenty". In 1960, Clooney and Crosby co-starred in a [[The Bing Crosby – Rosemary Clooney Show|20-minute CBS radio program]] that aired before the midday news each weekday.

Clooney left Columbia Records in 1958, doing a number of recordings for [[MGM Records]] and then some for [[Coral Records]]. Finally, toward the end of 1958, she signed with [[RCA Victor]], where she recorded until 1963. In 1964, she was signed to [[Reprise Records]], and in 1965 to [[Dot Records]].

[[File:Rosemary Clooney Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|Clooney performing in 1977]]
In 1976, Clooney signed with [[United Artists Records]] for two albums. Beginning in 1977, she recorded an album every year for the Concord Jazz record label,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.concordmusicgroup.com/artists/Rosemary-Clooney/ |title=Rosemary Clooney: Concord Music Group |publisher=Concord Music Group, Inc. |location=Beverly Hills, California |access-date=December 13, 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20131214023202/http://www2.concordmusicgroup.com/artists/Rosemary-Clooney/ |archive-date=December 14, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> a schedule which continued until her death. This was in contrast to most of her generation of singers, who had long since stopped recording regularly by then. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Clooney did television [[advertising|commercial]]s for Coronet brand paper towels, during which she sang a memorable [[jingle]] that went, "Extra value is what you get, when you buy Coro-net." Clooney sang a duet with [[Wild Man Fischer]] on "It's a Hard Business" in 1986, and in 1994, she sang a duet of ''[[Green Eyes (Aquellos Ojos Verdes)|Green Eyes]]'' with [[Barry Manilow]] in his 1994 album, ''[[Singin' with the Big Bands]]''.

In 1995, Clooney [[guest appearance|guest-starred]] in the NBC television medical drama ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' (starring her nephew, George Clooney); for her performance, she received a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress – Drama Series|Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series]]. On January 27, 1996, Clooney appeared on [[Garrison Keillor]]'s ''[[Prairie Home Companion]]'' radio program. She sang "[[When October Goes]]"—lyrics by [[Johnny Mercer]] and music by Barry Manilow (after Mercer's death)—from Manilow's 1984 album ''[[2:00 AM Paradise Cafe]]'', and discussed the excellence of Manilow the musician.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/programs/19960127|date=27 January 1996|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125054507/http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/programs/19960127/|archive-date=25 November 2005|title=A Prairie Home Companion|website=Minnesota Public Radio}}</ref>

Clooney was also awarded [[Society of Singers|Society of Singers Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.singers.org/special-events/|title=Ella Award Special Events|date=February 12, 2011|access-date=May 10, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514064028/http://www.singers.org/special-events/|archive-date=May 14, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 1999, she founded the Rosemary Clooney Music Festival, held annually in Maysville, her hometown.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/News/9906/10/showbuzz/ "Rosemary Clooney to help rescue ailing theater"], ''Showbuzz'', CNN.com, June 10, 1999.

Proceeds benefit the restoration of the Russell Theater in Maysville, where Clooney's first film, ''[[The Stars Are Singing]]'', premiered in 1953.

She received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 2002.

==Personal life==
[[File:Ken Murray Rosemary Clooney Lux Show 1957.JPG|thumb|left|With [[Ken Murray (entertainer)|Ken Murray]] on ''The Lux Show Starring Rosemary Clooney'' (1957)]]
Clooney was married twice to Puerto Rican movie star [[José Ferrer]], 16 years her senior. Clooney first married Ferrer on June 1, 1953, in [[Durant, Oklahoma]].<ref name="songsters176">{{cite book |title=Hollywood Songsters |last=Parish |first=James Robert |author2=Michael R. Pitts|year=1991 |publisher=Garland |location=New York |isbn=0-415-94332-9 |page=176 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GlybVaD6cakC}}</ref> They moved to [[Santa Monica, California]], in 1954, and then to [[Los Angeles]] in 1958. Together, the couple had five children: [[Miguel Ferrer|Miguel]], Maria, Gabriel, Monsita, and Rafael. Clooney and Ferrer divorced for the first time in 1961.

Clooney remarried Ferrer on November 22, 1964, in Los Angeles. However, the marriage again crumbled while Ferrer was carrying on an affair with the woman who would become his last wife, Stella Magee. The couple divorced again after she found out about the affair, this time in 1967.

In 1968, her relationship with a drummer ended after two years. At this time, following a tour, she became increasingly dependent on tranquilizers and sleeping pills.<ref name="songsters176"/>

[[File:Rosemary Clooney 1997.jpg|thumb| Clooney in 1997]]
She joined the [[1968 United States presidential election|presidential campaign]] of close friend [[Robert F. Kennedy]], and heard the shots when he was [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|assassinated]] on June 5, 1968.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=bl8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA78 ''Los Angeles Magazine'' June 1998] 158 pages Vol. 43, No. 6 page 78 ISSN 1522-9149 Published by Emmis Communications</ref> A month later, she had a [[nervous breakdown]] onstage in [[Reno, Nevada]] where she began shouting insults to her audience. She was hospitalized and remained in [[psychoanalytic therapy]] for eight years.<ref>Parish and Pitts (1991), p. 177</ref>

Her sister Betty died suddenly of a [[brain aneurysm]] in 1976. She subsequently started a foundation in memory of and named for her sister. During this time, she also wrote her first autobiography, ''This for Remembrance: the Autobiography of Rosemary Clooney, an Irish-American Singer'', written in collaboration with Raymond Strait and published by [[Playboy Enterprises|Playboy Press]] in 1977.<ref>{{cite book |last= Clooney |first= Rosemary |author2= Raymond Strait |title= This for remembrance : the autobiography of Rosemary Clooney |publisher= [[Playboy Press]] |year= 1977 |isbn= 0-671-16976-9 |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/thisforremembran00cloo }}</ref> She chronicled her unhappy early life, her career as a singer, her marriage to Ferrer, her mental breakdown in 1968, and the diagnosis of [[bipolar disorder]] that seriously disrupted her career, concluding with her comeback as a singer and her happiness. Her good friend Bing Crosby wrote the introduction. Katherine Coker adapted the book for [[Jackie Cooper]], who produced and directed the television movie, ''Rosie: the Rosemary Clooney Story'' (1982) starring [[Sondra Locke]] (who lip syncs Clooney's songs), [[Penelope Milford]] as Betty, and [[Tony Orlando]], who played José Ferrer.

In 1983, Rosemary and her brother Nick co-chaired the Betty Clooney Foundation for the Brain-Injured, addressing the needs of survivors of cognitive disabilities caused by [[stroke]]s, [[tumor]]s, and [[brain damage]] from trauma or age.

In 1997, she married her longtime friend and a former dancer, [[Dante DiPaolo]] at St. Patrick's Church in Maysville, Kentucky.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://enquirer.com/editions/1997/11/08/loc_clooney.html|title=Town stands up at Clooney wedding|date=November 8, 1997|work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://stevenlewis.info/crosby/clooney.htm|title=Rosemary Clooney marries Dante DiPaolo 1997 -- Bing Crosby Internet Museum -- www.stevenlewis.info|website=stevenlewis.info|access-date=2019-09-19}}</ref>

In 1999, Clooney published her second autobiography, ''Girl Singer: An Autobiography'', describing her battles with addiction to [[prescription drug]]s for [[major depressive disorder|depression]], and how she lost and then regained a fortune.<ref>{{cite book |last= Clooney |first= Rosemary |author2=Joan Barthel|title= Girl singer: an autobiography |publisher= [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |year= 1999 |isbn= 0-385-49334-7}}</ref> "I'd call myself a sweet singer with a big band sensibility," she wrote.

===Lung cancer and death===
A longtime heavy smoker, Clooney was diagnosed with lung cancer at the end of 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starsneverfade.com/rosie.htm|title=Rosie|publisher=starsneverfade.com|access-date=May 3, 2012|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120912193017/http://www.starsneverfade.com/rosie.htm|archive-date=September 12, 2012}}</ref> Around this time, she gave one of her last concerts in [[Hawaii]], backed by the [[Honolulu Symphony Orchestra|Honolulu Symphony Pops]]; her last song was "[[God Bless America]]". Her final show was at [[Red Bank, New Jersey]]'s [[Count Basie Theatre]] in December 2001. Despite [[Lung cancer surgery|surgery]] and a long period of care following, she died six months later on June 29, 2002, at her [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] home. Her nephew, George Clooney, was a [[pallbearer]] at her funeral. She is buried at Saint Patrick's Cemetery, Maysville.{{Citation needed |date=September 2021}}

===Legacy===
[[File:Rosemary Clooneys home in Augusta.jpg|thumb|right|Rosemary Clooney's Riverfront Home, Augusta, Kentucky]]

Clooney lived for many years in [[Beverly Hills, California]], in the house formerly owned by [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]] at 1019 North Roxbury Drive. It was sold to a developer after her death in 2002, and has since been demolished. In 1980, she purchased a second home on Riverside Drive in [[Augusta, Kentucky]], near Maysville, her childhood hometown. Today, the Augusta house offers viewing of collections of her personal items and [[souvenir#memorabilia|memorabilia]] from many of her films and singing performances.

In 2003, Rosemary Clooney was inducted into the [[Kentucky Women Remembered]] exhibit and her portrait by Alison Lyne is on permanent display in the [[Kentucky State Capitol]]'s rotunda.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lyneart.com/KYWOMEN3.HTM |title=Lyne Kentucky Women Remembered 2003 |publisher=Alison Davis Lyne |website=lyneart.com |access-date=December 13, 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20131214035548/http://www.lyneart.com/KYWOMEN3.HTM |archive-date=December 14, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Also in 2003, [[Bette Midler]] joined forces after many years with Barry Manilow to record ''[[Bette Midler Sings the Rosemary Clooney Songbook]]''. The album was an instant success, being certified gold by [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. One of the songbook selections, "This Ole House", became Midler's first [[Christian radio]] single shipped by Rick Hendrix and his positive music movement. The album was nominated for a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] the following year.

In 2005, the album ''[[Reflections of Rosemary]]'' by [[Debby Boone]] was released. Boone, who was Clooney's daughter-in-law, intended the album to be a musical portrait of Clooney, or as Boone put it: "I wanted to select songs that would give an insight into Rosemary from a family perspective".<ref name="clooney">{{cite web|url=http://www.rosemaryclooney.com/debbyboone/|title=Debby Boone's Reflections of Rosemary|publisher=rosemaryclooney.com|access-date=November 28, 2011}}</ref>

In September 2007, a mural honoring moments from her life was painted in downtown Maysville; it highlights the 1953 premiere of ''The Stars are Singing'' and her singing career. It was painted by [[Louisiana]] muralists [[Robert Dafford]], [[Herb Roe]], and Brett Chigoy as part of the [[Maysville, Kentucky#Maysville Murals|Maysville Floodwall Murals]] project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofmaysville.com/tourism/floodwall%20murals.html |title=Maysville Floodwall Mural Project |access-date=March 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228085421/http://www.cityofmaysville.com/tourism/floodwall%20murals.html |archive-date=February 28, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM6QT6_Rosemary_Clooney_Mural_Maysville_KY|title=Rosemary Clooney Mural – Maysville, KY|access-date=March 23, 2010}}</ref> Her brother Nick Clooney spoke during the dedication for the mural, explaining various images to the crowd.<ref>{{Cite news|title=The Pointer Sisters make excitement in Maysville|author=Misty Maynard|date=September 30, 2007|work=The Ledger Independent|url=http://www.maysville-online.com/news/article_17addc6d-dc69-5e93-b561-4e68fc3a217e.html}}</ref>
