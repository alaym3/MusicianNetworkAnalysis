'''Burhan Genç Koç''' ({{IPA-tr|ˈbuɾhan ˈɟentʃ|pron}}), known as '''Burhan G''' (born 20 January 1983), is a Danish [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and pop singer, songwriter and producer. He has released three albums including ''[[Burhan G (album)|Burhan G]]'' in 2010 and ''[[Din for evigt]]'', both certified platinum in Denmark. Hit singles include the five number one hits "[[Mest ondt]]" featuring [[Medina (singer)|Medina]], "[[Tættere på himlen]]" featuring [[Nik & Jay]], "Din for evigt", "Kalder mig hjem" and "Karma" featuring [[L.O.C. (rapper)|L.O.C.]].

==Beginnings==
Burhan Genç is of [[Kurds|Kurdish]] origin.<ref name="auto">http://politiken.dk/kultur/musik/anmeldelser_rockpop/ECE949045/rnb-crooneren-burhan-mangler-mod/</ref> His parents are from [[Haymana]], Turkey. He lived in [[Brøndby Strand]] ([[Copenhagen County]]) 13 kilometers south-west of central [[Copenhagen]] and sang in the "Københavns Drengekor" (Copenhagen Boys Choir) as a solo soprano. He was also a backing singer for the popular Danish hip hop group [[Outlandish]]. The group originated from [[Brøndby Strand]] projects and Burhan G toured with the group as backing vocals and also delivered the chorus in the Outlandish hit "Walou" from their debut album ''[[Outland's Official]]''. Collaborations followed with various other acts including [[Funk Flush]], Cas and [[U$O]].

==Career==
Burhan G's solo debut was with the signature track "Burhan G", which was on [[DR P3|P3 Radio]]'s ''Uundgåelige'' in September 2003. On 24 May 2004, Burhan G released his debut album ''Playground'' on BMG, with a further track featured on Danish Radio P3's ''Uundgåelige'' with single "Take U Home". The album ''Playground'' got Burhan G nominated in 2005 to 3 categories in the Danish Music Awards. He won the award for Best Danish Newcomer. He was nominated for Danish P3 Radio's "P3 Prisen" and "P3 Gennembrudet" at P3 Guld ceremonies. Same year he won award for "Best Danish Album" at the Danish DeeJay Awards.

In March 2007, Burhan G signed with record label [[Copenhagen Records]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.dk/nyheder|title=Seneste nyheder - MTV|website=www.mtv.dk|accessdate=26 August 2019}}</ref> instead of BMG and on 10 September 2007 released with them his second album ''Breakout'' and a single from the album cowritten by Burhan G and Frederik Tao from Maximum Risk and entitled "Who Is He" became a hit.

In the summer of 2008, Burhan G released his new single "Kun dig" ("Only you"). It was written in collaboration with Claus Seest and produced by [[Majid (rapper)|Majid]] and Saqib.<ref>[http://vip.tv2.dk/article.php/id-11908609:burhan-g-klar-med-nyt-album-p%C3%A5-dansk.html TV2: Burhan G klar med nyt album på dansk] (in Danish)</ref> The song was Burhan G's first hit in Danish followed by a Danish-language album, the self-titled ''Burhan G''. This was followed by another successful single written in collaboration with [[Rasmus Seebach]] in Danish entitled "Jeg vil ha' dig for mig selv" ("I want you for myself") that heavily sampled [[Milli Vanilli]]'s 1988 hit "[[Girl You Know It's True (song)|Girl You Know It's True]]". Parts of the lyrics came from [[Nik & Jay]]'s song "I Love Ya" and in November 2009, that version was released by Nik & Jay providing vocals.

In April 2010, Burhan G collaborated with Rasmus Seebach again alongside Sarah West and Nik & Jay.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gaffa.dk/nyhed/37588|title=Burhan G debuterer på dansk|website=gaffa.dk|accessdate=26 August 2019}}</ref> He explained in a press release that he chose to express himself in Danish, "because I love music and because I love all the different ways one can express oneself" claiming he was inspired by artists [[Kim Carnes]] and [[Sanne Salomonsen]] and [[Kim Larsen]]. This Danish venture proved quite well as it gave Burhan G his first ever Danish No. 1 in "[[Mest ondt]]" (translated as What hurts the most) released on 8 March 2010 and reaching the [[Tracklisten]] (Danish Singles Chart) top spot for 1 week. The single features the Danish singer [[Medina (singer)|Medina]]. The follow-up single "[[Tættere på himlen]]" featuring [[Nik & Jay]] also topped the charts for three weeks in October 2010. Both were certified platinum in addition to a preceding single "Jeg vil ha' dig for mig selv" also certified platinum. "Who Is He" and "Kun dig" singles have been certified gold in Denmark.
