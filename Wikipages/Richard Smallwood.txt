'''Richard Smallwood''' (born November 30, 1948 in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[gospel music|gospel]] artist who formed The Richard Smallwood Singers in 1977 in Washington, DC.

==Education and career==
Richard Smallwood graduated cum laude from [[Howard University]] with degrees in both vocal performance and piano, in addition to graduate work in the field of ethnomusicology. Smallwood was a member of The Celestials, the first gospel group on Howard University's campus. That group was the first gospel act to appear at Switzerland's Montreux Jazz Festival. Smallwood was also a founding member of Howard's first gospel choir.

Smallwood's recording career began in 1982 with the album ''The Richard Smallwood Singers''. The album spent 87 weeks on Billboard's Gospel chart. Its followup, ''Psalms'' was nominated for a Grammy. Two years later the album ''Textures'' was also nominated. ''Textures'' spawned the now-classic "Center Of My Joy" written by Richard Smallwood along with Bill and Gloria Gaither. Smallwood won his first Grammy, along with a Dove Award for his production on the Quincy Jones' gospel project ''[[Handel's Messiah: A Soulful Celebration]]''.

Smallwood's music has been recorded by artists such as [[Destiny's Child]], [[Yolanda Adams]], [[Karen Clark-Sheard]], and many more. He accompanied opera legend [[Leontyne Price]] at a White House Christmas celebration during the Reagan administration. Smallwood, with his current group Vision, has recorded several successful projects for Verity records. He finished his master's degree in Divinity from Howard University in 2004 and was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 2006.

Smallwood's next project was recorded live at the Hammerstein Ballroom at the Manhattan Center in New York. The concert features guests [[Kim Burrell]] on "Journey", [[Kelly Price]] on "Morning's Breaking," [[Chaka Khan]] on "Precious Is Your Name," as well as The Hawkins Family, [[Tramaine Hawkins]], and the original roster of singers who comprised The Richard Smallwood Singers and Vision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freewebs.com/ladywoo/gospelnewshappenings.htm|title=Ladywoo Ministry of Music|date=August 3, 2005}}</ref> [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[The Clark Sisters]] would contribute to additional studio tracks to appear on the album.<ref name="journeybv">{{cite web|url=http://blackvoices.aol.com/black_entertainment/bvbuzzcanvas/_a/august-30-2005/20050829171909990001|title=Jubilant Journey|date=August 30, 2005|author=Murray, Jawn|publisher=AOL Black Voices}}</ref>

Among Smallwood's most popular songs are ''Total Praise'', composed in 1996 while he was experiencing sorrow in his life, and ''I Love the Lord'', popularized by singer [[Whitney Houston]] in the film, ''[[The Preacher's Wife]]''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Alexander, Keith L.|title=Millions of gospel fans know Richard Smallwood's music.
