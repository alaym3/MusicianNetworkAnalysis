===''The Greatest Showman and "Never Enough"''===
In 2014, she was a member of the recording ensemble for a film musical being developed by the Broadway songwriting team of [[Pasek and Paul|Benj Pasek and Justin Paul]]. After working on early demos, she was cast as the singing voice of [[Rebecca Ferguson]]'s character, [[Jenny Lind]], on the project ''[[The Greatest Showman]]''. The film soundtrack and song were successful, going Platinum and the soundtrack topping the ''Billboard'' albums chart in January 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Discover Utah's Loren Allred, the voice behind the hit song 'Never Enough' from 'The Greatest Showman' soundtrack|url=https://www.deseret.com/2018/1/18/20638421/discover-utah-s-loren-allred-the-voice-behind-the-hit-song-never-enough-from-the-greatest-showman-so|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=2018-01-18|website=Deseret News|language=en|access-date=2020-05-23}}</ref> That same month, "Never Enough" (Allred's featured song) reached number 88 on the Hot 100.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/2018-01-13 | title=The Billboard Hot 100}}</ref>

Loren's vocal performance of "Never Enough" has received widespread acclaim. ''Variety'' said her "incandescent" performance "will sweep you up";<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gleiberman|first=Owen|date=2017-12-31|title=The Critical Sin of 'The Greatest Showman': It's Defiantly Uncool|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/columns/the-greatest-showman-critical-sin-its-defiantly-uncool-1202650344/|access-date=2020-10-28|website=Variety|language=en-US}}</ref> ''Just Jared'' called it "Next Level". ''American Idol'' alum Kelly Clarkson recorded a cover for the album ''[[The Greatest Showman (soundtrack)#The Greatest Showman: Reimagined|The Greatest Showman: Reimagined]]'' and praised Loren on Twitter for her performance of the song.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Tweets|url=https://twitter.com/kellyclarkson/status/976808297750769666|access-date=2020-10-28|website=Twitter|language=en}}</ref> Other notable artists who've since covered the song include Jennifer Hudson, Nicole Scherzinger, Katherine McPhee, Maria Simorangkir, and Morissette Amon. "Never Enough" has inspired thousands of covers on singing competition shows and across social media. 

=== "Help Me Make it Through the Night" with Michael Bublé ===
In early 2019, Loren joined Michael Bublé's L''ove'' album for a duet of “Help Me Make it Through the Night.” Bublé discovered Loren while watching the "The Greatest Showman" and released a behind the scenes recording of their duet. Michael noted that Loren has “the most beautiful voice and control”.<ref>{{Citation|title=Michael Bublé - Help Me Make It Through The Night (feat. Loren Allred) [ Track by Track]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQDkcpKPdZ4|language=en|access-date=2021-09-13}}</ref>  

=== Andrea Bocelli Tour 2021 ===
Loren will be joining Andrea Bocelli for select performances on his 2021 USA Tour. "If an artist wants to move the listener, they must have something intense and convincing to tell through their singing. This something comes from experiences and insight: it is the inner wealth that you can acquire by living. Loren Allred is a perfect example of this: her richly nuanced voice, her expressiveness, and her powers of communication describe and celebrate the beauty she has managed to cultivate within herself. A versatile musician raised in the arts, I remember how pleasantly surprised I was when we sang together for the first time in Saudi Arabia. I am delighted to soon be able to return to the stage with Loren, in that great country that is her homeland and my adoptive homeland" <ref>{{Cite web|title=Facebook|url=https://www.facebook.com/andreabocelli/photos/if-an-artist-wants-to-move-the-listener-they-must-have-something-intense-and-con/4891115207568330/|access-date=2021-09-13|website=www.facebook.com|language=en}}</ref>- Andrea Bocelli
