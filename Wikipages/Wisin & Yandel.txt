== Music career ==

=== Beginning (1998–2004) ===
In 1998, Wisin & Yandel participated in the album ''No Fear 3'', produced by DJ Dicky as well as on the compilation album ''La Misión Vol. 1'', edited by the ''Fresh Productions'' label. The success of this collection (which was certified gold) led the label to produce ''[[Los Reyes del Nuevo Milenio]]'', the first album by Wisin & Yandel.

From that moment the duo started a successful career. They continued posting new topics in the successive editions of ''La Misión'' and recorded three new albums: ''[[De Nuevos a Viejos]]'' (2001), ''[[Mi Vida... My Life]]'' (2003) and ''[[De Otra Manera]]'' (2004), all of which were certified gold. The duo also received the Tu Música Award for Best Rap/Reggaeton Duo in 2002.

In 2004, the duo released two separate solo efforts: ''[[El Sobreviviente]]'' by Wisin and ''[[Quien Contra Mí]]'' by [[Yandel]], which sparked speculation about a possible separation. Sales of the albums were unimpressive, and the duo remained together.

=== ''Pa'l Mundo'' and WY Records (2005–06) ===

The duo started their own label under the name of WY Records. In 2005, they released their first album under it, titled ''[[Pa'l Mundo]]'', which became their most successful to date. The record reached international status when it reached countries like China, Japan and some European countries. The album also peaked at #1 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Top Latin Albums]] and was certified gold by RIAA. After the success of ''Pa'l Mundo'', Wisin & Yandel released ''[[Los Vaqueros]]'' in 2006, which featured appearances of WY Records artists like Franco "El Gorila", [[Tony Dize]], and Yomille Omar, as well as guest artists like [[Don Omar]] and [[Hector el Father]].

=== International consolidation (2007–12) ===

On November 7, 2007, Wisin & Yandel released the album ''[[Wisin vs. Yandel: Los Extraterrestres|Los Extraterrestres]]'', which featured collaborations with international artists like [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]] and [[Fat Joe]]. The album was received positively by the Puerto Rican media, with mainstream newspaper ''Primera Hora'' awarding it a score of 4 out of 5.<ref name="Evolución Musical">{{cite book| title=CD Rankea'o: Otro acierto de Wisin & Yandel| publisher=Primera Hora| location=Puerto Rico| chapter=Así| language=es| date=2007-11-24| page=44}}</ref> The review praised the fusion of styles found in the album, claiming that the production continued the "musical evolution" found in its predecessors.<ref name="Evolución Musical"/>

=== Hiatus and solo careers (late 2013–2017) ===

In November 2013, after the Líderes tour, the dúo went into hiatus,<ref name=ultimoconcierto /> causing rumors to arise about their split, saying it was because of differences between them. Yandel denied such claims, assuring fans that they have not disbanded.<ref name=cosmo /> In early April 2014, Wisin said on [[Radio Fórmula]]: "I think that late 2015 or 2016 we're ready with a new album as Wisin & Yandel – This is just a facet; it's a pause to refresh ourselves to make something different."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.radioformula.com.mx/notas.asp?Idn=402234&idFC=2014 |title=Proyecto con Yandel no termina; habrá nuevo disco |publisher=[[Radio Fórmula]] |access-date=April 29, 2014}}</ref> Later in August 2014, Yandel said: "Wisin & Yandel is a registered trademark, we always work together – We are now providing separate projects, we'll soon be seen together again."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.diarioshow.com/notas/2014/08/31/95561-yandel-pronto-volvere-con-wisin.html| title=YANDEL: "PRONTO VOLVERE CON WISIN" | work=DiarioShow | language=es| date=2014-08-31| access-date=2014-09-02}}</ref>

In September 2014, they both confirmed they were working on a new track that would premiere and be performed for the first time on Yandel's De Líder a Leyenda tour on October 4, at the [[José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.primerahora.com/entretenimiento/musica/nota/wisinyandelcocinansujunteparaelcholiseo-1033541/| title=Wisin & Yandel: Cocinan su junte para el Choliseo | work=PrimeraHora | language=es| date=2014-09-06| access-date=2014-09-09}}</ref>

Beginning in 2017, the two have made collaborations for each other in a couple of songs.
