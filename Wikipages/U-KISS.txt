==History==

=== 2008: Formation and Debut ===
U-KISS was formed as a six-member boy band in 2008. [[Allen Kim|Kibum]] and [[Kevin Woo|Kevin]] were previously members of the boy band XING, but had left that group in early 2007. The other four members were all individually selected by [[NH Media]] through auditions.

U-KISS first performed on August 15, 2008, at Power of Atamix 08 in Japan. The group officially debuted in South Korea on August 28, with a live performance of their debut song, "Not Young", on [[Mnet (TV channel)|Mnet]].<ref name="enews" /> This was followed by the release of their first [[mini-album]], ''New Generation'' (N-Generation), on September 3.

Although they were newcomers in the industry,  U-KISS was considered for a Japan-Korea collaborative project. A Japanese entertainment company, Yashimoto Group, invested 150 billion [[South Korean won|KRW]] to groom U-KISS as an internationally known group.

===2009–2010: Line-up change, ''Only One'', and first tours===

On February 3, 2009, U-KISS released their second mini-album ''Bring It Back 2 Old School'', with the title song "I Like You", which gained them popularity, especially in [[Thailand]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mikieholiday.com/events|title=Events|publisher=Mikie Holiday|access-date=2012-10-29}}</ref><ref name=tracklist>{{cite web|title=Bring It Back 2 Old School (Mini Album) by U-KISS on Soribada|url=http://www.soribada.com/#/Music/Album/?TID=KE0000333|work=[[Soribada]]|date=February 3, 2009|access-date=February 1, 2012}}</ref>

On November 6, their third mini-album, ''ContiUKiss'', launched Kiseop as the seventh member of the group. The title track, "[[Man Man Ha Ni]]", was released following the change in their line-up.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Newsen|url=http://www.newsen.com/news_view.php?uid=201002231555221001&search=title&searchstring=%EC%9C%A0%ED%82%A4%EC%8A%A4|title=Man Man Ha Ni|date=November 5, 2009|access-date=February 19, 2018}}</ref>

On February 3, 2010, the group's first full-length album, ''[[Only One (U-KISS album)|Only One]]'', was released, generating their highest chart-topping single in the [[Philippines]], "[[Bingeul Bingeul]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popseoul.com/2010/02/03/u-kiss-releases-album/|title=U-KISS Releases Album|publisher=popseoul|access-date=2012-03-04}}</ref> The song peaked at #2 on the MYX Music Channel Hit and International Top 20 charts for the period of April 25 - May 1.
