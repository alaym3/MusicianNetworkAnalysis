'''Liza May Minnelli''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|aɪ|z|ə}} {{respell|LY|zə}}; born March 12, 1946) is an American actress, singer, dancer and choreographer. Known for her commanding stage presence and powerful [[alto]] singing voice, Minnelli is among a rare group of performers awarded an [[List of EGOT winners|Emmy, Grammy (Grammy Legend Award), Oscar, and Tony]] (EGOT).<ref>{{Cite news|quote="...and her voice -- a ripe, rounded alto whose physical qualities remain uncannily reminiscent of her mother, Judy Garland..."|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/31/arts/the-arts-news-and-reviews-pop-liza-minnelli-opens-3-week-carnegie-date.html|title=Liza Minnelli Opens 3-Week Carnegie Date|date=May 31, 1987|work=The New York Times}}</ref> Minnelli is a Knight of the French [[Legion of Honour]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=2011-07-12|title=Liza Minnelli receives Legion of Honour award|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-14118909|access-date=2021-01-25}}</ref>

Daughter of actress and singer [[Judy Garland]] and director [[Vincente Minnelli]], Minnelli was born in Los Angeles, spent part of her childhood in Scarsdale, New York, and moved to [[New York City]] in 1961 where she began her career as a [[musical theatre]] actress, [[nightclub]] performer and traditional [[pop music]] artist. She made her professional stage debut in the 1963 [[Off-Broadway]] revival of ''[[Best Foot Forward (musical)|Best Foot Forward]]''<ref name="Forward">Scott Schechter (2004): ''The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook'', pp. 12–13.</ref> and won a [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical|Tony Award]] for starring in ''[[Flora the Red Menace]]'' in 1965,<ref>Scott Schechter (2004): ''The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook'', p. 47.</ref> which marked the start of her lifelong collaboration with [[John Kander]] and [[Fred Ebb]]. They wrote, produced or directed many of Minnelli's future stage acts and TV shows, and helped create her stage persona of a stylized survivor, including her career-defining performances of anthems of survival ("[[Theme from New York, New York|New York, New York]]", "[[Cabaret (Cabaret song)|Cabaret]]" and "[[Maybe This Time (song)|Maybe This Time]]").<ref>James Leve (2009): ''Kander and Ebb'', p. 20.</ref> Along with her roles on stage and screen, this persona and her style of performance added to Minnelli's status as an enduring [[gay icon]].<ref>

An acclaimed performance in the drama film ''[[The Sterile Cuckoo]]'' (1969), marked a film breakthrough for Minnelli and garnered her a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She rose to international prominence with her portrayal of [[Sally Bowles]] in the musical film ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'' (1972), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. Most of her following films, including ''[[Lucky Lady]]'' (1975), ''[[New York, New York (1977 film)|New York, New York]]'' (1977), ''[[Rent-a-Cop (film)|Rent-a-Cop]]'' (1988) and ''[[Stepping Out (1991 film)|Stepping Out]]'' (1991), were panned by critics and bombed at the box office, and she had no more major movie hits except ''[[Arthur (1981 film)|Arthur]]'' (1981).<ref>Scott Schechter (2004): ''The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook'', p. 87.</ref> She returned to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on a number of occasions, including ''[[The Act (musical)|The Act]]'' (1977) for which she earned a second Tony Award, ''[[The Rink (musical)|The Rink]]'' (1984) and ''[[Liza's at The Palace....]]'' (2008), worked on various television formats and has predominantly focused on [[music hall]] and nightclub performances since the late 1970s. Her concert performances at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1979 and 1987, and at [[Radio City Music Hall]] in 1991 and 1992 are recognized among her most successful. From 1988 to 1990, she toured with [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] in ''Frank, Liza & Sammy: The Ultimate Event''.

While Minnelli is known for her renditions of [[Great American Songbook|American standards]], her early-1960s pop singles were produced to attract a young audience.<ref>Scott Schechter (2004): ''The Liza Minnelli Scrapbook'', pp. 13, 127</ref><ref>Scott Schechter (2006): ''The Complete Capitol Collection''</ref> Her albums from 1968 to 1977 contained contemporary singer-songwriter material. In 1989, she ventured into the contemporary pop scene by collaborating with the [[Pet Shop Boys]] on the album ''[[Results (album)|Results]]''. After a hiatus due to serious health problems, Minnelli returned to the concert stage in 2002 with ''[[Liza's Back]]'' and was a guest star in the sitcom ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'' between 2003 and 2013. Since the 2010s, she has avoided huge concert performances in favor of small retrospective performances.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Jacob|author-link=Jacob Bernstein|title=Fire Island′s Got Talent|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/09/fashion/fire-islands-got-talent.html|date=August 8, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=July 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Hetrick|first=Adam|author-link=Adam Hetrick|title=Liza Minnelli Joins Michael Feinstein for Intimate Concert and Conversation Tonight|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/liza-minnelli-joins-michael-feinstein-for-intimate-concert-and-conversation-tonight|date=June 30, 2018|work=Playbill|access-date=July 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Liza Minnelli Returns to the Stage with a Touching Tribute|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/VIDEO-Liza-Minnelli-Returns-to-the-Stage-with-a-Touching-Tribute-20180702|date=July 2, 2018|work=Broadwayworld|access-date=July 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Quintos|first=Michael|author-link=Michael Quintos|title=BWW Review: Liza Minnelli and Michael Feinstein Perform Together at OC's Segerstrom Center|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/los-angeles/article/BWW-Review-Liza-Minnelli-and-Michael-Feinstein-Perform-Together-at-OCs-Segerstrom-Center-20180706|date=July 6, 2018|work=Broadwayworld|access-date=July 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Abramovitch|first=Seth|author-link=Seth Abramovitch|title=What Is Going On With Liza Minnelli?

Her first performing experience on film was at age three appearing in the final scene of the musical ''[[In the Good Old Summertime]]'' (1949); the film stars Garland and [[Van Johnson]]. In 1961 she moved to New York City, attending [[High School of Performing Arts]] and later, [[Chadwick School]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Edvige|last=Giunta|author-link=Edvige Giunta|title=The Milk of Almonds: Italian American Women Writers on Food and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4r9CdS8DqTEC&pg=PA30|date=2002|publisher=Feminist Press|isbn=978-1-55861-453-6|pages=30–}}</ref>

==Career==

===Theatre===
During 1961, Minnelli was an apprentice at the Cape Cod Melody Tent in Hyannis, Massachusetts. She appeared in the chorus of ''Flower Drum Song'' and played the part of Muriel in ''Take Me Along''. She began performing professionally at age 17 in 1963 in an Off-Broadway revival of the musical ''[[Best Foot Forward (musical)|Best Foot Forward]]'', for which she received the Theatre World Award.

The next year, her mother invited her to perform with her in concert at the [[London Palladium]]. Both concerts were recorded and released as an album. She attended [[Scarsdale High School]] for one year, starring in a production of ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (play)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' which then went to Israel on tour. She turned to Broadway at 19, and won her first Tony Award as a leading actress for ''[[Flora the Red Menace]]''. It was the first time that she worked with the musical pair [[John Kander]] and [[Fred Ebb]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

===Music===
Minnelli began as a nightclub singer as an adolescent, making her professional nightclub debut at the age of 19 at the Shoreham Hotel in Washington, D.C. That same year she began appearing in other clubs and on stage in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, and New York City. Her success as a live performer led to her record several albums for [[Capitol Records]]: ''[[Liza! Liza!]]'' (1964), ''[[It Amazes Me]]'' (1965), and ''[[There Is a Time]]'' (1966). In her early years, she recorded [[Traditional pop music|traditional pop]] standards as well as show tunes from various musicals in which she starred. Because of this fact, William Ruhlmann named her "[[Barbra Streisand]]'s little sister".<ref>[http://www.starpulse.com/Music/Minnelli_Liza/Discography/Index/P3130/1/1] {{dead link|date=October 2019}}</ref> The Capitol albums ''Liza! Liza!'', ''It Amazes Me'', and ''There Is A Time'' were reissued on the two-CD compilation ''The Capitol Years'' in 2001, in their entirety.

From 1968 to the 1970s, she also recorded her albums ''[[Liza Minnelli (album)|Liza Minnelli]]'' (1968), ''[[Come Saturday Morning (Liza Minnelli album)|Come Saturday Morning]]'' and ''[[New Feelin']]'' (both 1970) for [[A&M Records]]. She released ''[[The Singer (Liza Minnelli album)|The Singer]]'' (1973) and ''[[Tropical Nights (Liza Minnelli album)|Tropical Nights]]'' (1977) on [[Columbia Records]].

In 1989, Minnelli collaborated with the [[Pet Shop Boys]] on ''[[Results (album)|Results]]'', an electronic dance-style album. The release hit the top 10 in the UK and charted in the U.S., spawning four singles: "[[Losing My Mind]]"; "[[Don't Drop Bombs]]"; "[[So Sorry, I Said]]"; and "[[Love Pains]]". Later that year, she performed "Losing My Mind" live at the Grammys Award ceremony before receiving a Grammy Legend Award (the first Grammy Legend Awards were issued in 1990 to Minnelli, [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], [[Smokey Robinson]], and [[Willie Nelson]]). With this award, she became one of only 16 people—[[List of people who have won an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony Award|a list]] that includes composer [[Richard Rodgers]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Barbra Streisand]], and [[John Gielgud]] and others—to win an [[Emmy]], [[Grammy]], [[Tony Award]], and [[Academy Award]].

In April 1992, Minnelli appeared at the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|tribute concert]] for her late friend [[Freddie Mercury]], performing "[[We Are the Champions]]" with the surviving members of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]] at Wembley Stadium in London.<ref>[http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/queen/videos/the-freddie-mercury-tribute-concert-10th-anniversary-reissue.htm#We%20Are%20The%20Champions "The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert: We Are the Champions"]. Ultimate Queen. Retrieved December 8, 2012</ref> In 1996, Minnelli released a studio album titled ''[[Gently (album)|Gently]]''. It was a recording of jazz standards and included contemporary songs such as the cover of ''[[Does He Love You]]'' which she performed as a duet with [[Donna Summer]]. This album brought her a Grammy nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album|Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance]].

In 2006, Minnelli appeared on [[My Chemical Romance]]'s album ''[[The Black Parade]]'', providing backing vocals and singing a solo part with [[Gerard Way]] on the track "Mama". Minnelli was nominated in 2009 for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album for her studio recording ''[[Liza's at the Palace...!]]'', based on her hit Broadway show. Minnelli released an album on the [[Decca Records]] label titled ''Confessions'' on September 21, 2010.<ref name="playbill.com">[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/139436-Liza-Minnellis-Confessions-CD-Due-in-September-Artwork-Revealed Liza Minnelli's "Confessions" CD Due in September; Artwork Revealed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512235932/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/139436-Liza-Minnellis-Confessions-CD-Due-in-September-Artwork-Revealed |date=May 12, 2010 }}.

===Film===
[[File:Liza Minnelli Cabaret 1972 crop.JPG|thumb|right|As [[Sally Bowles]] in ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'']]
Minnelli's first appearance on film is as the baby in the final shot of her mother's film ''[[In the Good Old Summertime]]'' (1949). Her first credited film role was as the love-interest in ''[[Charlie Bubbles]]'' (1967), [[Albert Finney]]'s only film as director and star, although four years earlier, she did voiceover work for the animated film ''[[Journey Back to Oz]]'', a sequel to ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. Minnelli was the voice of Dorothy (a character played in the earlier film by her mother Judy Garland) in what would have been her first credited film role had it been released in 1964 as planned—the [[Filmation]] production was delayed, eventually being released in the UK during 1972.

Minnelli appeared in ''[[The Sterile Cuckoo]]'' (1969), [[Alan J. Pakula]]'s first feature film, as Pookie Adams, a needy, eccentric teenager. Her performance was nominated for the Academy Award for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress in a Leading Role]]. She played another eccentric character in ''[[Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon]]'' (1970), directed by [[Otto Preminger]]. A nude scene in that film, filmed in a Massachusetts cemetery, resulted in a [[misdemeanor]] complaint by family of those buried there, and a "Liza Minnelli Bill" was introduced the following year to penalise filming in Massachusetts cemeteries without permission.<ref>{{AFI film|id=23451|title=Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|page=5|title=Mass. Cemeteries Safe From Nude Pic Capers|date=June 17, 1970}}</ref>

Minnelli appeared in her best-known film role, [[Sally Bowles]], in the film version of ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'' (1972). She said that one of the things she did to prepare was to study photographs of actresses [[Louise Glaum]] and [[Louise Brooks]] and the dark-haired women of the era in which the film is set.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Liza Minnelli: Be "strange and extraordinary", her father once told her. She listened|magazine=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]|first=Ingrid|last=Sischy|date=February 2004}}</ref>{{Verify source|date=September 2019|type=magazine}} Minnelli won the Academy Award for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress in a Leading Role]] for her performance, along with a [[Golden Globe Award]], [[BAFTA Award]], and also [[Sant Jordi Award]] and [[David di Donatello Award]] for Best Foreign Actress.

Following the success of ''Cabaret'', [[Bob Fosse]] and Minnelli teamed for ''[[Liza with a Z|Liza with a 'Z'. A Concert for Television]]'', a television special. The program aired two times on TV and was not seen again until a DVD release in 2006.

Minnelli appeared in three expensive flops in three years, with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' suggesting by 1978 that she was the number-one choice for box office poison.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 4, 1978|title='Star Wars'; What Else Was News in 1977|last=Frederick|first=Robert B.|page=21}}</ref> First was ''[[Lucky Lady]]'' (1975), then she worked with her father in ''[[A Matter of Time (film)|A Matter of Time]]'' (1976), co-starring [[Ingrid Bergman]] and then ''[[New York, New York (1977 film)|New York, New York]]'' (1977), which gave Minnelli her best known [[signature song]]. She sometimes performed duets on stage with [[Frank Sinatra]], who recorded a cover version (for his ''[[Trilogy: Past Present Future]]'' album).

Minnelli made fewer film appearances from then on, but her next film, ''[[Arthur (1981 film)|Arthur]]'' (1981), where she starred as [[Dudley Moore]]'s love interest, was a big hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1981&p=.htm|title=1981 Domestic Grosses|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref> She returned to film for ''[[Rent-A-Cop (film)|Rent-A-Cop]]'' and ''[[Arthur 2: On the Rocks]]'' (both 1988) and ''[[Stepping Out (1991 film)|Stepping Out]]'' (1991), a musical comedy drama. She later appeared in ''[[The Oh in Ohio]]'' in 2006 which received only a [[limited release]] in theatres.<ref name=Mojo>{{Mojo title|id=ohinohio|title=The Oh in Ohio}}</ref>

===Television===
[[File:Baryshnikov - Minnelli 1981 TV.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mikhail Baryshnikov]] and Minnelli in ''Baryshnikov on Broadway'', 1980]]
During the 1950s, Minnelli appeared as a child guest on [[Art Linkletter]]'s show and sang and danced with [[Gene Kelly]] on his first television special in 1959. She was a guest star in one episode of ''[[Ben Casey]]'' and was a frequent guest on chat shows of the day including numerous appearances on shows hosted by [[Jack Paar]], [[Merv Griffin]], [[Mike Douglas]], [[Joe Franklin]], [[Dinah Shore]] and [[Johnny Carson]]. During the 1960s, she made several guest appearances on ''[[Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In]]'' as well as other variety shows such as ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]'', and ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]''.

In 1964, she appeared as Minnie in her first television dramatic role in the episode "Nightingale for Sale" on [[Craig Stevens (actor)|Craig Stevens]]'s short-lived series ''[[Mr. Broadway]]''.

In December 1992, American Public Television aired ''Liza Minnelli Live from Radio City Music Hall'' produced by Phil Ramone and Chris Giordano. The show received six Emmy nominations and won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Music and Lyrics, awarded to Fred Ebb and John Kander.

Much later in her career, Minnelli made guest appearances on shows such as ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', ''[[Law & Order: Criminal Intent]]'' and ''[[Drop Dead Diva]]''. In the UK, she appeared on the [[Ruby Wax]], [[Graham Norton]] and [[Jonathan Ross]] shows, and in October 2006, participated in a comedy skit on [[Charlotte Church]]'s show and was featured on [[Michael Parkinson]]'s show.

In November 2009, American Public Television aired ''Liza's at the Palace'', taped from September 30 to October 1, 2009, in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand's Hollywood Theatre.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.aptonline.org/catalog.nsf/bpt/A29BB5F22345E3F385257631006757C9?OpenDocument |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 6, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119075717/https://www.aptonline.org/catalog.nsf/bpt/A29BB5F22345E3F385257631006757C9?OpenDocument |archive-date=November 19, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The executive producers of the taping, Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, were previously involved with the 2005 rerelease of 1972's Emmy- and Peabody Award-winning ''[[Liza with a Z]]''.<ref>Cox, Gordon (September 17, 2009) [https://variety.com/2009/legit/news/liza-s-palace-to-get-tv-reprise-1118008782/ Liza's 'Palace' to get TV reprise]. ''Variety''.</ref>

===Later career===
Minnelli returned to Broadway in 1997, taking over the title role in the musical ''[[Victor/Victoria (musical)|Victor/Victoria]]'', replacing [[Julie Andrews]]. In his review, ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' critic Ben Brantley wrote "her every stage appearance is perceived as a victory of show-business stamina over psychic frailty. She asks for love so nakedly and earnestly, it seems downright vicious not to respond."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Brantley|first1=Ben|title=For Liza Minnelli, the Affection of Her Fans Is the Milk of Life|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/14/theater/for-liza-minnelli-the-affection-of-her-fans-is-the-milk-of-life.html|access-date=June 17, 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 14, 1997}}</ref>

After a serious case of [[viral encephalitis]] in 2000, doctors predicted that Minnelli would spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair and perhaps not be able to speak again. However, taking vocal and dance lessons daily (especially with [[Sam Harris (singer)|Sam Harris]], [[Eugene Louis Faccuito|Luigi Faccuito]], Ron Lewis, and Angela Bacari), she managed to recover. She appeared on a September 19, 2001, episode of ''The Rosie O'Donnell Show,'' notable because it was Rosie's first show back following the September 11 attacks. Despite having vocal surgery shortly prior, she sang her signature song, "New York, New York", and received an enthusiastic ovation. She also returned to the stage in 2001 when asked by long-time friend [[Michael Jackson]] to perform at Madison Square Garden in New York City where she sang "Never Never Land" and the televised "You Are Not Alone" at the [[Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special]] concert produced by future husband [[David Gest]]. Minnelli told reporters: "I am stable as a table."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tv.avclub.com/arrested-development-switch-hitter-queen-for-a-day-1798173305|title=Arrested Development: "Switch Hitter"/"Queen For A Day"|website=TV Club}}</ref>

Gest was so impressed with Minnelli's stamina and ability to stun audiences that he produced her in ''[[Liza's Back]]'' in Spring 2002, performing to rave reviews in London and New York City. The tour featured a tribute to her mother: after years of declining fans' pleas for her to sing Garland's signature song "[[Over The Rainbow]]", she concluded Act 1 with the final refrain of her mother's anthem to an instant ovation.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}
