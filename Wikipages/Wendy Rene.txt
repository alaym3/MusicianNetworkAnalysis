==Biography==
Mary Frierson was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].<ref name=allmusic>[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/wendy-rene-mn0000818439 Biography by Andrew Hamilton at Allmusic.com]. Retrieved April 27, 2013</ref> Her father was of mixed race and married a Memphis musician who was nearly 20 years his junior; the couple had three sons and one daughter. The family were members of the [[Church of God in Christ]].

As a teenager, Mary Frierson formed a singing quartet, the Drapels, with her brother [[Johnnie Frierson]] and two friends, Marianne Brittenum and Wilbur Mondie.  They auditioned for Stax co-founder [[Jim Stewart (music)|Jim Stewart]] in 1963, and were immediately offered a recording contract.  Before leaving, Mary showed Stewart some of the songs she had written, and was also offered a solo contract.<ref name=light>[http://lightintheattic.net/artists/398-wendy-rene/bio  Liner notes at LightInTheAttic.net]. Retrieved April 27, 2013</ref> While in her teens, she married a military man, but the young couple soon parted ways.

She needed a stage name, and several options came up including the name Wendy Storm, suggested by Stax receptionist-turned PR head Deanie Parker.<ref name=mehr/> [[Otis Redding]] then came up with the name Wendy Rene, which she preferred, and she used that name regularly as a solo artist.  Her first solo single, "After Laughter (Comes Tears)", co-written with her brother, was released in August 1964, and became a local hit but failed to make the national R&B chart.  The record featured [[Booker T. Jones]] on organ.<ref name=light/> The song had been recorded by the Drapels, but was released under Wendy Rene's name. The group split up soon afterwards.<ref name=allmusic/>

Her second solo single, "Bar-B-Q", was released in November 1964, to cash in on the popularity of [[dance craze]] records.  Featuring [[Steve Cropper]] on guitar, it failed to reach the charts.  However, she continued to record and to tour with Stax stars, including [[Rufus Thomas]] and Otis Redding, and to sing backing vocals on their records.  In 1967, she married songwriter and Stax employee James Cross.<ref name=mehr/> In December of that year, she was scheduled to fly with Redding and the [[Bar-Kays]] for what would have been her final live performance for the foreseeable future.  A new mother, she backed out at the last minute to stay home with her child. Tragically, the plane crashed in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] leaving Redding and six others dead.<ref name=mehr>[http://www.gomemphis.com/news/2012/feb/16/cover-story-unsung-stax-star-gets-due/?print=1  Bob Mehr, ''Unsung Stax star Wendy Rene gets due on 'After Laughter Comes Tears' '', GoMemphis.com, 16 February 2012]. Retrieved April 28, 2013</ref><ref>Interview with Andria Lisle, Autumn 2011, Published with CD release ''After Laughter Comes Tears'', Light in the Attic records c 2012</ref>

Wendy Rene then retired from the music business and, as Mary Cross, devoted herself to her family and church, the Bountiful Blessing Church of God in Christ in Memphis.  She and James Cross have five sons and one daughter.  In 2010, she returned to the stage briefly at the [[Ponderosa Stomp]] in [[New Orleans]].<ref name=light/>

Several of her songs have been used in films (''[[Head-On (film)|Gegen die Wand]]'', ''[[The Fighting Temptations]]'', ''[[Lucky Number Slevin]]'', ''[[The Wackness]]'', ''[[Felix and Meira]]'', ''[[The Lady in the Car with Glasses and a Gun (2015 film)|The Lady in the Car with Glasses and a Gun]]'') and sampled/redone by current artists such as [[Wu-Tang Clan]] (in "[[Tearz]]"), [[Metro Boomin]], [[Ariana Grande]], [[Alicia Keys]] and [[Lykke Li]].  [[Chili's]] Restaurant used Rene's "Bar-B-Q" single for their 2013 commercial.

In 2003 [[Ace Records (UK)|Ace Records]] released a compilation CD of her recordings, ''You Thrill My Soul'', which included several that were originally unreleased.<ref name=allmusic/> Another compilation, ''After Laughter Comes Tears'', was issued by Light in the Attic Records in 2012.<ref name=mehr/>
