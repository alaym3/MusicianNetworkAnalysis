Born and raised in [[San Diego, California]], RuPaul later studied performing arts in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].

In 1994, he became a spokesperson for [[MAC Cosmetics]], raising money for the [[Mac AIDS Fund]] and becoming the first drag queen to land a major cosmetics campaign. That year, he received his own talk show on [[VH1]] called ''[[The RuPaul Show]]'', which he hosted for over 100 episodes while co-hosting the morning radio show on [[WKTU]] with [[Michelle Visage]].

To date, ''RuPaul's Drag Race'' has produced thirteen seasons in the United States and 2 in the [[RuPaul's Drag Race UK|United Kingdom]] ({{as of|2021|lc=y}}). The show has seen success globally with a further six international formats of the show in production.

He is also featured as a host on series such as ''[[Skin Wars]]'', ''[[Good Work (talk show)|Good Work]]'', and ''[[Gay for Play Game Show Starring RuPaul]]''.

In the early 1990s, RuPaul worked the Georgia club scene and was known by his full birth name. Initially participating in [[gender bender]]-style performances, RuPaul performed solo and in collaboration with other bands at several [[New York City]] nightclubs, most notably the [[Pyramid Club (New York)|Pyramid Club]]. He played opposite New York City drag performer Mona Foote (Nashom Benjamin) in the one-act [[science-fiction]] parody "My Pet Homo" written and directed by Jon Michael Johnson for Cooper Square Productions. He appeared for many years at the annual [[Wigstock]] [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] festival and appeared in the [[documentary film|documentary]] ''[[Wigstock: The Movie]]''. In the 1990s, RuPaul was known in the UK for his appearances on the [[Channel 4]] series ''Manhattan Cable'', a weekly series produced by [[World of Wonder (production company)|World of Wonder]] and presented by American Laurie Pike about New York's [[public-access television]] system.

==Career==
===1993–1997: ''Supermodel of the World'', ''Foxy Lady'', and ''Ho Ho Ho''===
In 1993, RuPaul recorded the [[Dance music|dance]]/[[house music|house]] album ''[[Supermodel of the World]]''. It was released through the rap label [[Tommy Boy Entertainment|Tommy Boy]], spawning the [[Dance music|dance track]] hit "[[Supermodel (You Better Work)]]". The [[music video]] was an unexpected success on MTV channels, as [[grunge]] and [[gangsta rap]] were popular at the time. The song peaked at 45 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It charted on the [[UK Singles Chart]], peaking on the top 40 at 39. The song found the most success on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] chart, where it peaked at 2. Radio airplay, heavy rotation of the music video on [[MTV]] and television appearances on popular programs like ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'' popularized the song.

I don't choose projects so people don't see me as one thing or another. I choose projects that excite me. I think the problem is that people refuse to understand what drag is outside of their own belief system.|RuPaul<ref name=DS/>}}

His next two singles/videos, "[[Back to My Roots]]" and "[[A Shade Shady (Now Prance)]]", both went to the top spot on the ''Billboard'' Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart and furthered his [[Camp (style)|campy]] persona. Between them, "[[House of Love (RuPaul song)|House of Love]]" was released without a video. It failed to place on any U.S. charts, despite rising to 68 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].

RuPaul was signed to a modeling contract for [[Make-up Art Cosmetics|MAC Cosmetics]]. Various billboards featured him in full drag, often with the text "I am the MAC girl". He also released his [[autobiography]], ''[[Lettin' It All Hang Out]]''. He promoted the book in part with a 1995 guest appearance on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[All My Children]]'', in a storyline that put it on the set of [[Erica Kane]]'s talk show "The Cutting Edge".

The next year he landed a talk show of his own on [[VH1]], called ''[[The RuPaul Show]]'', interviewing [[celebrity]] guests and musical acts. [[Diana Ross]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Duran Duran]], [[Pat Benatar]], [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Bea Arthur]], [[Dionne Warwick]], [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Beenie Man]], [[Pete Burns]], [[Bow Wow Wow]], and the [[Backstreet Boys]] were notable guests. His co-host was [[Michelle Visage]], with whom he also co-hosted on [[WKTU]] radio. On one episode, RuPaul featured guests [[Chi Chi LaRue]] and [[Tom Chase]] speaking about the [[gay]] [[pornography|porn]] industry.

Later in the year he released his second album, ''[[Foxy Lady (RuPaul album)|Foxy Lady]]'', this time on the L.A.-based [[Rhino Records]] label. Despite his growing celebrity, he failed to chart on the ''Billboard'' 200. However, the first single "[[Snapshot (RuPaul song)|Snapshot]]" found success in the dance market and went to number four on the [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] chart. It also enjoyed limited mainstream success, charting at 95 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, which was his second and only other Hot 100 entry to date (1996?). The second single "[[A Little Bit of Love (RuPaul song)|A Little Bit of Love]]" only charted at 28 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The album featured covers of a 1981 [[Diana Ross]] song "Work That Body", co-written by [[Paul Jabara]] and "[[If You Were a Woman (And I Was a Man)|If You Were a Woman and I Was a Man]]", originally recorded by [[Bonnie Tyler]]. Because of his strong fan base within the [[gay community]], RuPaul has performed at [[gay pride]] events and numerous [[gay club]]s. During this time RuPaul helped launch the return of WKTU radio in [[New York City]] and would serve as host of the morning show until 1998.

In 1997, he released his third album, a [[Christmas]] album entitled ''[[Ho Ho Ho (album)|Ho Ho Ho]]''. He has had guest appearances in many films, including both [[The Brady Bunch Movie|''Brady Bunch'' movies]], in which he played Jan's female guidance counselor. In 1997, RuPaul teamed with [[Martha Wash]] to remake the classic disco anthem, "[[It's Raining Men]]". The song was included on the 1998 compilation CD ''[[Rupaul's Go-Go Box Classics|RuPaul's Go Go Box Classics]]'', which was a collection of some of his favorite dance songs by other artists; this would be his third and final release through [[Rhino Records]] and a major record label. It was during this time that he appeared in [[Webex]] TV commercials and magazine ads. In 2002, he recorded with [[Brigitte Nielsen]], credited as Gitta, the [[Eurodance]] track "You're No Lady".

===2004–2007: ''Red Hot'', ''ReWorked'', and ''Starrbooty''===
[[File:RuPaul by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|RuPaul in 2007]]
In 2004, RuPaul released his fourth album, ''[[Red Hot (album)|Red Hot]]'' on his own RuCo Inc. music label. It received some dance radio and club play, but very little press coverage. On his [[blog]], RuPaul discussed how he felt betrayed by the entertainment industry, particularly the [[gay press]]. In one incident, it was noted that ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' refused to review the album, instead asking him to make a comedic contribution to a fashion article. He likened the experience to "a black person being invited to a party, but only if they'll serve." Despite his apparent dissatisfaction with the release, ''Red Hot'' showed RuPaul returning to the top of the dance charts in the US with the lead off single "[[Looking Good, Feeling Gorgeous]]" hitting number two on the dance chart. The second, "[[Workout (RuPaul song)|WorkOut]]", peaked at number five. The third and final single from the album "People Are People" a duet with Tom Trujillo peaked at number 10. The album itself only charted on the [[Dance/Electronic Albums|Top Electronic Albums]] chart, where it hit number nine.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/2004-10-16/dance-electronic-albums |title=Dance/Electronic Albums : Oct 16, 2004 &#124; Billboard Chart Archive |magazine=Billboard.com |access-date=December 3, 2013}}</ref> When asked about this in an interview, RuPaul said, "Well, betrayed might be the wrong word. 'Betrayed' alludes to an idea that there was some kind of a promise made to me, and there never was. More so, I was disappointed. I don't feel like it was a betrayal. Nobody promises anything in show business and you understand that from day one. But, I don't know what happened. It seemed I couldn't get press on my album unless I was willing to play into the role that the mainstream press has assigned to gay people, which is as servants of straight ideals."<ref name=DS>RuPaul in Shankbone, David. [[n:RuPaul speaks about society and the state of drag as performance art|Interview with RuPaul]], [[Wikinews]], October 6, 2007.</ref>

On June 13, 2006, RuPaul released ''ReWorked'', his first [[remix]] album and fifth album overall. It features reworked versions of songs from his back catalog, as well as new recordings. The only single released from the album is a re-recording of "Supermodel (You Better Work)", reaching number 21 on the U.S. dance chart. June 20, 2007, saw the release of ''[[Starrbooty#Soundtrack|Starrbooty: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]'' in the United States. The single "Call Me Starrbooty" was digitally released in 2007. The album contains new tracks as well as interludes with dialogue from the movie. The film was released on DVD in October 2007.

===2008–2010: ''RuPaul's Drag Race'' and ''Champion''===
[[File:Rupaul-2009 (cropped to collar).jpg|upright=0.7|left|thumb|RuPaul in 2009]]
In mid-2008, RuPaul began producing ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race]]'', a [[reality television]] [[game show]] which aired on [[Logo (TV channel)|Logo]] in February 2009.
