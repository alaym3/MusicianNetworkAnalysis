'''Scott Braden Cawthon''' (born June 4, 1978) is an American former<ref name=":0"/> video game developer and writer. He is the creator of the ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's]]'' media franchise, which began with the development of the [[Five Nights at Freddy's (video game)|eponymous survival horror game]] in 2014. Released [[Indie game|independently]], the game achieved popularity and obtained a [[cult following]]. Cawthon developed 10 games in the main series from 2014 until his retirement in 2021, in addition to three spin-offs. He also wrote several stories based on ''Five Nights at Freddy's'', including the novel ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's: The Silver Eyes|The Silver Eyes]]'' (2015).

==Early life and work==
Cawthon was born in [[Houston]], [[Texas]] on June 4, 1978. He is a devout [[Christians|Christian]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2014-10-25|title=Scott Cawthon on Faith, Games and Golden Freddy|url=https://geeksundergrace.com/gaming/developer-spotlight-scott-cawthon/|access-date=2021-06-11|website=Geeks Under Grace|language=en-US}}</ref> He currently lives in [[Salado, Texas]], with his wife and five sons.

Cawthon's career in game design and animation began in the 1990s. Cawthon revealed his first game (titled ''Doofas'') during a live stream;<ref>{{Citation|last=Dawko|title=Dawko's Charity Stream for American Red Cross PART 2|date=September 16, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEHSb9duykU&t=3s|access-date=September 17, 2017}}</ref> he made the game when he was a child. This game later became a troll game as the "demo" of ''[[Ultimate Custom Night]]''. His first official games were released in the early 2000s, one of the earliest known being ''RPG Max'', released in 2002. He later joined Hope Animation, where he created animations for children based on [[Christianity|Christian]] values.

On March 19, 2007, Cawthon uploaded the first part of an eight-part series titled ''The Pilgrim's Progress'' to his YouTube channel, which was released as a full-length film on DVD two years prior.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Pilgrim’s Progress &#124; Hope Animation|url=https://hopeanimation.com/shop/pilgrims-progress/}}</ref> The animation is a retelling of [[John Bunyan]]'s [[The Pilgrim's Progress|novel of the same name]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=The Pilgrim's Progress – Christian Movie/Film DVD|work=Christian Movies All in One Place, Easy to Find! CFDb!|url=https://www.christianfilmdatabase.com/review/the-pilgrims-progress/|access-date=May 28, 2017}}</ref> After releasing ''The Pilgrim's Progress'', Cawthon developed several games, including ''Sit N' Survive'', ''Chipper and Sons Lumber Co.'', and ''The Desolate Hope''. Some of these were submitted to [[Steam (service)#Steam Greenlight|Steam Greenlight]]. While ''The Desolate Hope'' made it through the process, some games, most notably ''Chipper and Sons Lumber Co.'', were heavily criticized by prominent reviewers for having characters that moved and interacted with each other like animatronic machines. While initially discouraged, almost to the point of stopping game development completely, Cawthon eventually decided to use the animatronic-like characters to his advantage, sparking the development of ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's]]''.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Five Nights at Freddy's 3|developer=Scott Cawthon|date=March 2, 2015|platform=[[Personal computer|PC]]|scene=Ending (Nightmare)}}</ref>

The game was well-received by critics,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/five-nights-at-freddys|title=Five Nights at Freddy's on Metacritic|publisher=Metacritic|access-date=September 7, 2014}}</ref> and became the subject of numerous popular [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Play]] videos on YouTube. On November 10, 2014, Cawthon released the first sequel titled, ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 2]]'' for $7.99 on [[Steam (service)|Steam]]. Soon after the release of ''Five Nights at Freddy's 2'', Cawthon removed all information from his official site and replaced it with an image of the word "offline".

On July 3, 2017, Cawthon announced the cancellation of a sixth main installment to ''Five Nights at Freddy's'', after previously stating a month earlier that a sixth game was in the works.

He also announced that a new book series, ''Five Nights at Freddy's: Fazbear Frights,'' is coming.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Upcoming Projects Mega-Thread! :: Ultimate Custom Night General Discussions|url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/871720/discussions/0/1733210552660120120/?tscn=1534704024|access-date=September 13, 2018|website=steamcommunity.com}}</ref> On August 27, 2018, Cawthon commented on a post regarding Fredbear's true voice in UCN, "I have a feeling we'll be seeing more of [[Kellen Goff|Kellen]] in the FNAF universe.

The book was released on December 17, 2015, as an e-book for [[Amazon Kindle|Amazon]]; a paperback edition is also available. According to Cawthon, the book was released earlier than its planned release date due to a mistake on Amazon's part.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Design&Trend|date=December 17, 2015|title='Five Nights at Freddy's: The Silver Eyes' Novel Released Early in Kindle And Paperback [LINK]|work=Design & Trend|url=http://www.designntrend.com/articles/66870/20151217/five-nights-at-freddys-silver-eyes-novel-released-early-kindle-paperback-link.htm|url-status=dead|access-date=May 28, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151218214646/http://www.designntrend.com/articles/66870/20151217/five-nights-at-freddys-silver-eyes-novel-released-early-kindle-paperback-link.htm|archive-date=December 18, 2015}}</ref> On June 24, 2016, Cawthon announced that he had made a three-book deal with [[Scholastic Corporation]] and that the first book (''The Silver Eyes'') would be reprinted on paperback in October that year, with the second and third being released in 2017 and 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Scholastic & Scottgames, LLC Announce a New Book Series Based on the Bestselling Video Game Franchise Five Nights at Freddy's {{!}} Scholastic Media Room|url=http://mediaroom.scholastic.com/press-release/scholastic-scottgames-llc-announce-new-book-series-based-bestselling-video-game-franch|access-date=September 17, 2017|website=mediaroom.scholastic.com}}</ref>

On June 27, 2017, Cawthon's second novel, ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's: The Twisted Ones]]'', was released.

On December 26, 2017, Cawthon released the second guidebook for ''Five Nights at Freddy's'' called ''Survival Logbook''. Unlike previous book releases, ''Survival Logbook'' has no listed Amazon Kindle editions, implying that it has pages designed for physical writing as opposed to simply reading from a device. The book, disguised as a normal children's activity book, contains many things to do, including a [[word search]], grid drawing, and fill-in-the-blank activities, however, all of these were found to hold secrets involving the lore.<ref>{{Cite web|date=June 11, 2017|title=Five Nights at Freddy's: Survival Logbook': New Details About Scott Cawthon's Upcoming Book|url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/five-nights-at-freddys-survival-logbook-news-new-details-about-scott-cawthons-upcoming-book-revealed-187021/|website=The Christian Post}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=June 12, 2017|title='Five Nights at Freddy's: Survival Logbook' teases at more help after release of 'The Freddy Files'|url=http://www.ibtimes.com.au/five-nights-freddys-latest-update-survival-logbook-teases-more-help-after-release-freddy-files|website=International Business Times}}</ref>

In August 2018, Scott Cawthon posted a Steam forum, in which he states that the movie will be based on the first game and that if second and third movies are made, they will be based on the second and third game, respectively.<ref name=":1" /> Later that same month, Blum tweeted that the film had a planned release window of 2020.<ref>{{Cite news|title=We are.

In November 2019, Cawthon announced that he would be creating a game specifically for a fundraising event for [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]] hosted by [[MatPat]], who would play the game with fellow YouTubers Dawko and [[Markiplier]] on a live stream. The game, Freddy in Space 2, was released December 3<ref>{{Cite web|title=Game Jolt – Indie games for the love of it|url=https://gamejolt.com/games/freddyinspace2/452650|access-date=February 27, 2020|website=Game Jolt}}</ref> on [[Game Jolt]], and included dollar amounts hidden throughout that dictated how much Cawthon would donate following the stream. He boasted that a total of $500,000 was available to find, but warned that it was difficult and that he doubted they'd be able to find it all, as his playtester had taken five hours to complete the game. Originally, the game had a two-hour slot to be featured in the live stream; however, Markiplier continued playing after the stream had ended and managed to find a final hidden $100,000 that raised the total donation figure to $451,200. Cawthon went on to donate the full $500,000 to St. Jude's.

On June 10, 2021, Cawthon trended on [[Twitter]] when his publicly available political donations were shared on Twitter. Barring a donation to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] representative [[Tulsi Gabbard]], all the donations were to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidates and organizations. Cawthon subsequently confirmed in a statement posted on [[Reddit]] that he is a Republican and that he has made significant financial donations in support of [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] political candidates, while also describing himself as "[[Anti-abortion movements|pro-life]]". He also claimed that after the donations were uncovered, he had been [[Doxing|doxed]] and had received threats of violence and home invasion. While the reaction to Cawthon's Reddit post was positive, reaction was mixed on social media sites like Twitter, <!-- The following material is removed often for being unproven. It comes from the adjacent PC Gamer citation. --> where some members of the [[LGBTQ|LGBTQ+]] community, who make up a significant portion of the fan base of the ''Five Nights at Freddy's'' franchise,<ref name="Chalk" />{{Better source needed|date=November 2021}} reacted negatively. A few days after the donations were discovered, Cawthon announced that he was retiring from professional game development, with plans to choose someone to oversee the ''Five Nights at Freddy's'' series after his retirement.<ref name="Chalk">{{cite magazine|last=Chalk|first=Andy|title=Five Nights at Freddy's creator 'won't apologize for' Trump support|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/five-nights-at-freddys-creator-wont-apologize-for-trump-support/|date=June 12, 2021|magazine=[[PC Gamer]]|access-date=June 13, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Crump|first=James|date=June 13, 2021|title=Five Nights at Freddy's Scott Cawthon Won't Apologize for Supporting Trump|work=[[Newsweek]]|url=https://www.newsweek.com/scott-cawthon-donated-donald-trump-mitch-mcconnell-1600132|access-date=June 13, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210617010357/https://www.newsweek.com/scott-cawthon-donated-donald-trump-mitch-mcconnell-1600132|archive-date=June 17, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Blake|first=Vikki|title=Five Nights at Freddy's creator confirms claims he has financially backed Donald Trump|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-06-13-five-nights-at-freddys-creator-confirms-claims-he-has-financially-backed-donald-trump|date=June 13, 2021|work=[[Eurogamer]]|access-date=June 13, 2021}}</ref><ref name="kotaku retire">{{cite web|url= https://kotaku.com/five-nights-at-freddy-s-creator-scott-cawthon-retires-a-1847118164|title=Five Nights At Freddy’s Creator Scott Cawthon Retires Amid Controversy|last=Walker|first=Ian|date=June 16, 2021|accessdate=June 16, 2021|work=[[Kotaku]]}}</ref>
