'''Jerome Silberman''' (June 11, 1933 – August 29, 2016), known professionally as '''Gene Wilder''', was an American actor, writer and filmmaker. He is known mainly for his comedic roles, but also for his portrayal of [[Willy Wonka]] in ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'' (1971), his work with [[Mel Brooks]] on the films ''[[The Producers (1967 film)|The Producers]]'' (1967), ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974) and ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' (1974), as well as his four films with [[Richard Pryor]]: ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]'' (1976), ''[[Stir Crazy (film)|Stir Crazy]]'' (1980), ''[[See No Evil, Hear No Evil]]'' (1989) and ''[[Another You]]'' (1991).<ref name="AP dies" />

Wilder began his career on stage, and made his screen debut in an episode of the TV series ''[[The Play of the Week]]'' in 1961. Although his first film role was portraying a hostage in the 1967 motion picture ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'',<ref name="AP dies" /> Wilder's first major role was as Leopold Bloom in the 1967 film ''[[The Producers (1967 film)|The Producers]]'' for which he was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. This was the first in a series of collaborations with writer/director [[Mel Brooks]], including 1974's ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' and ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'', which Wilder co-wrote, garnering the pair an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]].

Wilder directed and wrote several of his own films, including ''[[The Woman in Red (1984 film)|The Woman in Red]]'' (1984). With his third wife, [[Gilda Radner]], he starred in three films, the last two of which he also directed. Her 1989 death from [[ovarian cancer]] led to his active involvement in promoting cancer awareness and treatment, helping found the Gilda Radner Ovarian Cancer Detection Center in Los Angeles<ref name="AP dies" /> and co-founding [[Gilda's Club]].

After his last acting performance in 2003 – a guest role on ''[[Will & Grace]]'' for which he received an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor]] – Wilder turned his attention to writing. He produced a memoir in 2005, ''Kiss Me Like a Stranger: My Search for Love and Art''; a collection of stories, ''What Is This Thing Called Love?'' (2010); and the novels ''[[My French Whore]]'' (2007), ''The Woman Who Wouldn't'' (2008), and ''Something to Remember You By'' (2013).

==Early life==
Wilder was born Jerome Silberman on June 11, 1933, in [[Milwaukee]], Wisconsin, the son of Jeanne (Baer) and William J. Silberman, a manufacturer and salesman of novelty items.<ref name=nyt1>{{cite news|last1=Lewis|first1=Daniel|title=Gene Wilder Dies at 83; Star of 'Willy Wonka' and 'Young Frankenstein'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/movies/gene-wilder-dead.html|access-date=August 29, 2016 |work=The New York Times|date=August 29, 2016}}</ref> His father was a [[Russian Jews|Russian Jewish]] immigrant, as were his maternal grandparents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fox6now.com/2016/08/29/actor-gene-wilder-dies-at-83-family-confirms/|title=Milwaukee's own Gene Wilder, star of 'Willy Wonka' and Mel Brooks comedies, dead at 83, family says|date=August 29, 2016|publisher=Fox}}</ref> Wilder first became interested in acting at age eight, when his mother was diagnosed with [[rheumatic fever]] and the doctor told him to "try and make her laugh."<ref>Segal, David.

At the age of 11, he saw his sister, who was studying acting, performing onstage, and he was enthralled by the experience. He asked her teacher if he could become his student, and the teacher said that if he were still interested at age 13, he would take Wilder on as a student. The day after Wilder turned 13, he called the teacher, who accepted him; Wilder studied with him for two years.<ref>Wilder interview by Robert Osborne on [[Turner Classic Movies]] when Wilder was the guest film programmer (June 19, 2014).</ref>

When Jeanne Silberman felt that her son's potential was not being fully realized in Wisconsin, she sent him to [[Black-Foxe Military Institute|Black-Foxe]], a military institute in Hollywood, where he was [[Bullying|bullied]] and [[sexually assaulted]], primarily because he was the only [[Jewish]] boy in the school, according to his own account.<ref>Wilder, 13.</ref> After an unsuccessful short stay at Black-Foxe, Wilder returned home and became increasingly involved with the local theatre community. He performed for the first time in front of a paying audience at age 15, as [[Characters in Romeo and Juliet#Balthasar|Balthasar]] ([[Romeo Montague|Romeo]]'s servant) in a production of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''.<ref>Wilder, 17.</ref> Gene Wilder graduated from [[Washington High School (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|Washington High School]] in Milwaukee in 1951.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Wilder was raised Jewish, but he held only the [[Golden Rule]] as his philosophy. In a book published in 2005, he stated, "I have no other religion. I feel very Jewish and I feel very grateful to be Jewish. But I don't believe in God or anything to do with the Jewish religion".<ref>{{cite web |first=Abigail |last=Pogrebin |author-link=Abigail Pogrebin |url=http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/212030/gene-wilder-dead-at-83-the-comedic-icon-once-said-do-unto-others-as-you-would-have-them-do-unto-you |title=Gene Wilder Dead at 83; The Comedic Icon Once Said, 'Do Unto Others as You Would Have Them Do Unto You'  |work=[[Stars of David: Prominent Jews Talk About Being Jewish]] |via=Tablet |date=August 29, 2016 |access-date=August 30, 2016}}</ref>

==Acting career==

===Old Vic, Army, and HB Studio===
Following his 1955 graduation from Iowa, he was accepted at the [[Bristol Old Vic Theatre School]] in Bristol, England. After six months of studying fencing, Wilder became the first freshman to win the All-School Fencing Championship.<ref>Wilder, 39.</ref> Desiring to study [[Stanislavski's system]], he returned to the U.S., living with his sister and her family in [[Queens]]. Wilder enrolled at the [[HB Studio]].<ref>Wilder, 40.</ref>

Wilder was drafted into the Army on September 10, 1956. At the end of [[recruit training]], he was assigned to the [[Army Medical Department (United States)|medical corps]] and sent to [[Fort Sam Houston]] for training. He was then given the opportunity to choose any post that was open, and wanting to stay near New York City to attend acting classes at the HB Studio, he chose to serve as paramedic in the Department of Psychiatry and Neurology at [[Valley Forge General Hospital|Valley Forge Army Hospital]], in [[Phoenixville, Pennsylvania]].<ref>Wilder, 41–42.</ref> In November 1957, his mother died from [[ovarian cancer]]. He was discharged from the army a year later and returned to New York. A scholarship to the HB Studio allowed him to become a full-time student. At first living on unemployment insurance and some savings, he later supported himself with odd jobs such as a [[limousine]] driver and fencing instructor.

===Early career===
Wilder's first professional acting job was in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], where he played the Second Officer in [[Herbert Berghof]]'s production of ''[[Twelfth Night]]''. He also served as a fencing choreographer.<ref>Wilder, 50–51.</ref>

After three years of study with Berghof and [[Uta Hagen]] at the HB Studio, [[Charles Grodin]] told Wilder about [[Lee Strasberg]]'s [[method acting]]. Grodin persuaded him to leave the studio and begin studying with Strasberg in his private class. Several months later, Wilder was accepted into the [[Actors Studio]]. Feeling that "Jerry Silberman in ''Macbeth''" did not have the right ring to it, he adopted a stage name.<ref name="why"/> He chose "Wilder" because it reminded him of ''[[Our Town]]'' author [[Thornton Wilder]], while "Gene" came from the character Eugene Gant in [[Thomas Wolfe]]'s first novel, ''[[Look Homeward, Angel]]''. He also liked "Gene" because as a boy, he was impressed by a distant relative, a [[Second World War|World War II]] bomber navigator who was "handsome and looked great in his leather flight jacket".<ref name="why">Shelden, Michael. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3643010/Why-would-they-remake-Willy-Wonka.html "Why would they remake Willy Wonka?"]. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. Retrieved March 15, 2016.</ref><ref>Wilder, 60.</ref>{{efn|Wilder explained his decision to change his name: "I had always liked Gene because of [[Thomas Wolfe]]'s character Eugene Gant in ''[[Look Homeward, Angel]]'' and ''[[Of Time and the River]]''.

[[St. Martin's Press]], 2005. {{ISBN|0-312-33706-X}}.</ref>}} He later said that he could not see Gene Wilder playing ''Macbeth'', either.

After joining the Actors Studio, he slowly began to be noticed in the [[off-Broadway]] scene, thanks to performances in [[Sir Arnold Wesker]]'s ''[[Roots (play)|Roots]]'' and in [[Graham Greene]]'s ''[[The Complaisant Lover]]'', for which Wilder received the [[Clarence Derwent Award]] for "Best Performance by an Actor in a Nonfeatured Role".<ref name="Lover">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/gene-wilder-dead-dies-willie-wonka-young-frankenstein-1201846745/|title=Gene Wilder, 'Willy Wonka' Star and Comedic Icon, Dies at 83|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=August 29, 2016|access-date=August 29, 2016|first=Richard|last=Natale}}</ref> One of Wilder's early stage credits was playing the socially awkward mental patient Billy Bibbit in the original 1963–64 [[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (play)|Broadway adaptation]] of [[Ken Kesey]]'s novel ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' opposite star [[Kirk Douglas]].

===1960s===
In 1963, Wilder was cast in a leading role in ''[[Mother Courage and Her Children]]'', a production starring [[Anne Bancroft]], who introduced Wilder to her boyfriend (and later husband) [[Mel Brooks]].<ref name="cnn">[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0205/02/lkl.00.html "Larry King Live – Interview With Gene Wilder."] ''CNN.com – Transcripts''. Retrieved March 18, 2008.</ref> A few months later, Brooks mentioned that he was working on a screenplay called ''Springtime for Hitler'', for which he thought Wilder would be perfect in the role of [[Leo Bloom]]. Brooks elicited a promise from Wilder that he would check with him before making any long-term commitments.<ref name="cnn"/> Months went by, and Wilder toured the country with different theatre productions, participated in a televised [[CBS]] presentation of ''[[Death of a Salesman (1966 U.S. film)|Death of a Salesman]]'', and was cast for his first role in a film—a minor role in [[Arthur Penn]]'s 1967 ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]''. After three years of not hearing from Brooks, Wilder was called for a reading with [[Zero Mostel]], who was to be the star of ''Springtime for Hitler'' and had approval of his co-star. Mostel approved, and Wilder was cast for his first leading role in a feature film, 1967's ''[[The Producers (1967 film)|The Producers]]''.<ref>Wilder, 96.</ref>

''The Producers'' eventually became a [[cult film|cult comedy classic]],<ref>Oakes, Keily.

In 1969, Wilder relocated to Paris, accepting a leading role in [[Bud Yorkin]]'s ''[[Start the Revolution Without Me]]'', a comedy that took place during the [[French Revolution]]. After shooting ended, Wilder returned to New York, where he read the script for ''[[Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx]]'' and immediately called [[Sidney Glazier]], who produced ''The Producers''. Both men began searching for the perfect director for the film. [[Jean Renoir]] was the first candidate, but he would not be able to do the film for at least a year, so British-Indian director [[Waris Hussein]] was hired. With [[Margot Kidder]] co-starring with Wilder, it was filmed on location in Dublin, and at the nearby [[Ardmore Studios]], in August and September 1969.<ref>Wilder, 120–124.</ref>

===1970s===
In 1971, Wilder auditioned to play Willy Wonka in [[Mel Stuart]]'s [[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory|film adaptation]] of [[Roald Dahl]]'s ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]''. After reciting some lines, director [[Mel Stuart]] immediately offered him the role.<ref name="Wilder, 129">Wilder, 129.</ref> Before Wilder was officially cast for the role, [[Fred Astaire]], [[Joel Grey]], [[Ron Moody]], and [[Jon Pertwee]] were all considered.<ref name=hnn>{{cite web |last = Honeybone |first = Nigel |title = Film Review: ''Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'' (1971) |date = April 25, 2012 |url = http://horrornews.net/50901/film-review-willy-wonka-and-the-chocolate-factory-1971/ |access-date = July 8, 2015 }}</ref>

The three films Wilder appeared in following ''The Producers'' were box office failures: ''Start the Revolution'' and ''Quackser'' seemed to audiences poor copies of Mel Brooks films, while ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'' was not a commercial success, although it later gained a cult following and an Oscar nomination for Best Score, as well as a [[Golden Globe]] award nomination for Wilder.<ref name="Wilder, 133"/>

When [[Woody Allen]] offered him a role in one segment of ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (film)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]'', Wilder accepted, hoping this would be the hit to put an end to his series of flops. ''Everything ... '' was a hit, grossing over $18 million in the United States alone against a $2-million budget.<ref>"[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=everythingyoualwayswantedtoknowaboutsex.htm Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, but Were Afraid to Ask]" – Box Office Mojo.

After ''Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)'', Wilder began working on a script he called ''[[Young Frankenstein]]''. After he wrote a two-page scenario, he called Mel Brooks, who told him that it seemed like a "cute" idea, but showed little interest.<ref>Wilder, 140.</ref> A few months later, Wilder received a call from his agent, [[Mike Medavoy]], who asked if he had anything where he could include [[Peter Boyle]] and [[Marty Feldman]], his two new clients. Having just seen Feldman on television, Wilder was inspired to write a scene that takes place at Transylvania Station, where Igor and Frederick meet for the first time. The scene was later included in the film almost verbatim. Medavoy liked the idea and called Brooks, asking him to direct. Brooks was not convinced, but having spent four years working on two box-office failures, he decided to accept.<ref name="cnn"/> While working on the ''Young Frankenstein'' script, Wilder was offered the part of the Fox in the [[The Little Prince (1974 film)|musical film adaptation]] of [[Antoine de Saint Exupéry|Saint Exupéry]]'s classic book, ''[[The Little Prince]]''. When filming was about to begin in London, Wilder received an urgent call from  Brooks, who was filming ''Blazing Saddles'', offering Wilder the role of the "Waco Kid" after [[Dan Dailey]] dropped out at the last minute, while [[Gig Young]] became too ill to continue. Wilder shot his scenes for ''Blazing Saddles'' and immediately afterwards filmed ''The Little Prince''.<ref name="cnn"/>

After ''Young Frankenstein'' was written, the rights were to be sold to [[Columbia Pictures]], but after having trouble agreeing on the budget, Wilder, Brooks, and producer [[Michael Gruskoff]] went with [[20th Century Fox]], where both Brooks and Wilder had to sign five-year contracts. ''Young Frankenstein'' was a commercial success, with Wilder and Brooks receiving [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] nominations at the [[47th Academy Awards|1975 Oscars]],<ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=youngfrankenstein.htm ''Young Frankenstein''.] Box Office Mojo.

Marty Feldman and [[Madeline Kahn]] agreed to participate in the project, and Wilder began writing what became his directorial début, 1975's ''[[The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother]]''.<ref>Wilder, 154.</ref>

In 1975, Wilder's agent sent him a script for a film called ''Super Chief''. Wilder accepted, but told the film's producers that he thought the only person who could keep the film from being offensive was [[Richard Pryor]]. Pryor accepted the role in the film, which had been renamed ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]'', the first film to team Wilder and Pryor. They became Hollywood's first successful interracial movie comedy duo.<ref>''Jet'', January 9, 2006.</ref>

While filming ''Silver Streak'', Wilder began working on a script for ''[[The World's Greatest Lover]]'', inspired by [[Federico Fellini|Fellini]]'s ''[[The White Sheik]]''. Wilder wrote, produced, and directed ''The World's Greatest Lover'', which premièred in 1977, but was a critical failure.<ref>"[http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/worlds_greatest_lover/ ''The World's Greatest Lover (1977)''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220112455/http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/worlds_greatest_lover/ |date=December 20, 2008 }} RottenTomatoes.com.

In 1980 Wilder teamed up again with Richard Pryor in ''[[Stir Crazy (film)|Stir Crazy]]'', directed by [[Sidney Poitier]]. Pryor was struggling with a severe [[cocaine]] [[Drug addiction|addiction]], and filming became difficult, but once the film premiered, it became an international success. ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine listed "Skip Donahue" (Wilder) and "Harry Monroe" (Pryor) as number nine on their 2007 list of "The Fifteen Most Dynamic Duos in Pop Culture History", and the film has often appeared in "best comedy" lists and rankings.<ref>Wilder, 185–186.</ref><ref>Kois, Dane and Lane Brown.

Poitier and Wilder became friends, with the pair working together on a script called ''Traces''—which became 1982's ''[[Hanky Panky (1982 film)|Hanky Panky]]'', the film where Wilder met comedian [[Gilda Radner]]. Through the remainder of the decade, Wilder and Radner worked on several projects together. After ''Hanky Panky'', Wilder directed his third film, 1984's ''[[The Woman in Red (1984 film)|The Woman in Red]]'', which starred Wilder, Radner, and [[Kelly Le Brock]]. ''The Woman in Red'' was not well received by the critics, nor was their next project, 1986's ''[[Haunted Honeymoon]]'', which failed to attract audiences. ''The Woman in Red'' did win an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for [[Stevie Wonder]]'s song "[[I Just Called to Say I Love You]]".

[[TriStar Pictures]] wanted to produce another film starring Wilder and Pryor, and Wilder agreed to do ''[[See No Evil, Hear No Evil]]'' only if he were allowed to rewrite the script. The studio agreed, and ''See No Evil, Hear No Evil'' premiered in May 1989 to mostly negative reviews.

After starring as a political cartoonist who falls in love in the 1990 film ''[[Funny About Love]]'', Wilder performed in one final movie with Pryor, the 1991 feature ''[[Another You]]'', in which Pryor's physical deterioration from [[multiple sclerosis]] was clearly noticeable.<ref>{{cite news| agency= Associated Press|date=December 12, 2005|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10412702|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051212065958/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10412702/|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 12, 2005|title=Comedian Richard Pryor dies at 65| website=MSNBC|access-date= March 18, 2008}}</ref> It was Pryor's last starring role in a film (he appeared in a few cameos before he died in 2005) and also marked Wilder's last appearance in a feature film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://heavy.com/news/2016/08/gene-wilder-richard-pryor-movies-together-acting-careers-comedy-relationship-friendship-died-death/|title=Gene Wilder & Richard Pryor: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know|last=Stacey|first=Olivia|website=heavy.com|date=August 29, 2016|language=en|access-date=July 5, 2017}}</ref> His last two movies were not financially successful.

Wilder was inducted into the Wisconsin Performing Arts Hall of Fame, at the Marcus Center for the Performing Arts in Milwaukee, on April 9, 1991.<ref>{{cite news| newspaper= Wisconsin Jewish Chronicle, The|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/50011723|date=April 12, 1991|page=1|title= Old friends are 'kvelling' for Wilder|access-date=August 30, 2016}}</ref>

He went back to the small screen in 1999, appearing in three television movies, one of which was the NBC adaptation of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1999 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. The other two, ''[[Murder in a Small Town]]'' and ''[[The Lady in Question (1999 film)|The Lady in Question]]'', were mystery movies for [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E TV]] that were cowritten by Wilder, in which he played a theatre director turned amateur detective.

Three years later, Wilder guest-starred on two episodes of NBC's ''[[Will & Grace]]'', winning a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor - Comedy Series|Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor on a Comedy Series]] for his role as Mr. Stein, [[Will Truman]]'s boss.<ref name="Gary">{{cite news|last=Susman|first=Gary|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,485804,00.html|title= W for Winner|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=September 15, 2003|access-date= March 18, 2008}}</ref> This ended Wilder's screen career; from 2003 forward, Wilder focused his creative energies on writing novels and stories, as well as painting.

===Relationships===
Wilder met his first wife, Mary Mercier, while studying at the HB Studio in New York. Although the couple had not been together long, they married on July 22, 1960. They spent long periods of time apart, eventually divorcing in 1965. A few months later, Wilder began dating Mary Joan Schutz, a friend of his sister. Schutz had a daughter, Katharine, from a previous marriage. When Katharine started calling Wilder "Dad", he decided to do what he felt was "the right thing to do",<ref>Wilder, 105–106.</ref> marrying Schutz on October 27, 1967, and adopting Katharine that same year. Schutz and Wilder separated after seven years of marriage, with Katharine suspecting that Wilder was having an affair with his ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' co-star, [[Madeline Kahn]]. After the divorce, he briefly dated his other ''Frankenstein'' co-star, [[Teri Garr]]. Wilder eventually became estranged from Katharine.<ref name="cnn"/><ref>Wilder, 153–155.</ref>

Wilder met ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' actress Gilda Radner on August 13, 1981, while filming Sidney Poitier's ''Hanky Panky''. Radner was married to guitarist [[G. E. Smith]] at the time, but  Wilder and she became inseparable friends. When the filming of ''Hanky Panky'' ended, Wilder found himself missing Radner, so he called her. The relationship grew, and Radner eventually divorced Smith in 1982. She moved in with Wilder, and the couple married on September 14, 1984, in the south of France. The couple wanted to have children, but Radner suffered [[miscarriage]]s, and doctors could not determine the problem. After experiencing severe fatigue and suffering from pain in her upper legs on the set of ''Haunted Honeymoon'', Radner sought medical treatment. Following a number of false diagnoses, she was found to have ovarian cancer in October 1986.<ref name="gilda">Radner, Gilda. ''It's Always Something''. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1989.</ref> Over the next year and a half, Radner battled the disease, receiving chemotherapy and [[radiotherapy]] treatments. The disease finally went into remission, giving the couple a respite, during which time Wilder filmed ''See No Evil, Hear No Evil''.<ref name="gilda"/> By May 1989, the cancer returned and had metastasized. Radner died on May 20, 1989.<ref>Wilder, 188–220.</ref> Wilder later stated, "I always thought she'd pull through."<ref name="journey">Broeske, Pat H. [https://bookpage.com/interviews/8297-gene-wilder "Gene Wilder's fateful life journey."] ''BookPage''. Retrieved April 5, 2008.</ref>

Following Radner's death, Wilder became active in promoting cancer awareness and treatment, helping found the Gilda Radner Ovarian Cancer Detection Center in Los Angeles and co-founding [[Gilda's Club]], a support group to raise awareness of cancer that began in New York City and now has branches throughout the country.<ref name="alumni">[http://www.iowalum.com/daa/wilder.html ''Distinguished Alumni Winner: Gene Wilder''].

While preparing for his role as a deaf man in ''See No Evil, Hear No Evil'', Wilder met Karen Webb (née Boyer), who was a clinical supervisor for the New York League for the Hard of Hearing. Webb coached him in [[lip reading]]. Following Gilda Radner's death, Wilder and Webb reconnected, and on September 8, 1991, they married.<ref name="journey"/> The two lived in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], in the 1734 Colonial home that he had shared with Radner.

===Political views===
In 2007, Wilder stated, "I'm quietly political. I don't like advertising. Giving money to someone or support, but not getting on a bandstand. I don't want to run for president in 2008. I will write another book instead."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/05/15/gene_wilder_is_rooting_for_the_democrats |title=Gene Wilder Is Rooting For The Democrats |publisher=Starpulse.com |date=May 15, 2007 |access-date=February 23, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303124729/http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/05/15/gene_wilder_is_rooting_for_the_democrats |archive-date=March 3, 2011}}</ref> Wilder donated to [[Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign|Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Yoon|first=Robert|date=April 23, 2007|title=Celebrities ante up for Democratic campaigns|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/04/16/celebrity.contributions/index.html|access-date=August 21, 2020|website=edition.cnn.com}}</ref>

===Semi-retirement===
The Wilders spent most of their time painting [[Watercolor painting|watercolors]], writing, and participating in charitable efforts.<ref name="cnn"/>

[[File:GeneWilderMay07.jpg|thumb|upright|Wilder at a book signing in 2007]]
In 1998, Wilder collaborated on the book ''Gilda's Disease'' with [[oncologist]] Steven Piver, sharing personal experiences of Radner's struggle with ovarian cancer. Wilder himself was hospitalized with [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]] in 1999, but confirmed in March 2005 that the cancer was in complete remission following [[chemotherapy]] and a [[stem cell transplant]].<ref name="cnn"/>

On March 1, 2005, Wilder released his highly personal memoir, ''Kiss Me Like a Stranger: My Search for Love and Art'', an account of his life covering everything from his childhood up to Radner's death. Two years later, in March 2007, Wilder released his first novel, ''[[My French Whore]]'', which is set during [[World War I]].<ref>Wilder, Gene. ''My French Whore''.

In a 2008 [[Turner Classic Movies]] special, ''Role Model: Gene Wilder'', where [[Alec Baldwin]] interviewed Wilder about his career, Wilder said that he was basically retired from acting for good. "I don't like show business, I realized," he explained. "I like show, but I don't like the business."

In 2010, Wilder released a collection of stories called ''What Is This Thing Called Love?''<ref>{{cite book |title=What Is This Thing Called Love? |first=Gene |last=Wilder |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-312-59890-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/whatisthisthingc00gene }}</ref> His third novel, ''Something to Remember You By: A Perilous Romance'', was released in April 2013.<ref>{{cite book |title=Something to Remember You By: A Perilous Romance |first=Gene |last=Wilder |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=2013 |isbn=9780312598914 |url=https://archive.org/details/somethingtoremem0000wild }}</ref>

When asked in a 2013 ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out New York]]'' magazine interview whether he would act again if a suitable film project came his way, Wilder responded, "I'm tired of watching the bombing, shooting, killing, swearing and 3-D. I get 52 movies a year sent to me, and maybe there are three good [ones]. That's why I went into writing. It's not that I wouldn't act again. I'd say, 'Give me the script. If it's something wonderful, I'll do it.' But I don't get anything like that."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/newyork/things-to-do/interview-gene-wilder|title=Interview: Gene Wilder|work=Time Out New York|access-date=September 9, 2015}}</ref>
