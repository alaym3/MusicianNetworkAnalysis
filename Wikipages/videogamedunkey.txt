As of May 2021, Gastrow's YouTube channel has over six million subscribers, and his videos have collectively received over three billion views.

==Career==
Gastrow has been [[video editing]] since 2003.<ref name="WP: Bangs"/> As he explained in his review of the 2017 game ''[[Cuphead]]'', Gastrow created [[Flash animation]]s that he uploaded on the website [[Newgrounds]] under the username "Meatwadsprite". Examples include "Great [[Yoshi]] Migration", his first video, and a parody of the [[Village People]] song "[[Y.M.C.A. (song)|Y.M.C.A.]]"<ref name="WP: Bangs"/><ref>{{cite AV media|people=Gastrow, Jason|title=Old Dunkey and Cuphead|date=October 21, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCkPhYiKbJU|format=[[YouTube]]|publisher=videogamedunkey|access-date=July 5, 2019}}</ref> In an interview, Gastrow said he wanted to be an animator when he was young.<ref name="h3: Podcast"/>

Gastrow started his current [[YouTube]] channel, videogamedunkey, in 2010, with a video of him performing a [[speedrun]] of the 1991 game ''[[Battletoads (video game)|Battletoads]]''.<ref name="TR: 9Best"/> Prior to videogamedunkey, Gastrow had another channel. Gastrow recalled that the name "videogamedunkey" came about when he was playing ''[[Left 4 Dead]]'' with a friend. He "told him to pet a donkey or something," and after trapping his friend in the game, told him he would release him if he said "go go magic dunk".<ref name="h3: Podcast"/> By September 2015, the videogamedunkey channel had 1.8 million subscribers,<ref name="Kotaku: Defends">{{cite web|last1=Hernandez|first1=Patricia|date=September 14, 2015|title=Banned League of Legends YouTuber Defends His Trash Talking|url=https://kotaku.com/banned-league-of-legends-youtuber-defends-his-trash-tal-1730635674|access-date=July 5, 2019|website=[[Kotaku]]}}</ref> which had grown to 3.5 million by September 2017<ref name="TM: Jackassery">{{cite web |last1=Kurkerewicz |first1=Reid |title=The revealing jackassery of Videogamedunkey |url=https://www.tonemadison.com/articles/the-revealing-jackassery-of-videogamedunkey |website=Tone Madison |access-date=July 5, 2019 |date=September 19, 2017}}</ref> and 5.2 million by March 2019. Gastrow's videos have collectively generated over two billion views.<ref name="WP: Bangs"/> Outside of YouTube, Gastrow is active on [[Twitter]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gastrow |first1=Jason |title=dunkey (@vgdunkey) / Twitter |url=https://twitter.com/vgdunkey?lang=en |publisher=[[Twitter]] |access-date=September 30, 2019}}</ref> and has pages on [[Facebook]] and [[Reddit]]. He and his wife Leah also run Dunkey's Castle, an online merchandise shop.<ref name="h3: Podcast"/>

Gastrow primarily covers video games on his channel, posting reviews, playthroughs, [[video essay]]s, and montages.<ref name="WP: Bangs"/><ref name="h3: Podcast"/> He has also reviewed films, such as ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''.<ref name="h3: Podcast"/> During his channel's initial years, Gastrow was primarily known for his coverage of the 2009 [[multiplayer online battle arena]] game ''[[League of Legends]]''. According to Yannick LeJacq of ''[[Kotaku]]'', Gastrow "had a special place in the ''League of Legends'' universe for consistently producing some of the best, and definitely the funniest, material in the game's massive community".<ref name="Kotaku: Banned">{{cite web |last1=LeJacq |first1=Yannick |title=League Of Legends YouTube Jokester Gets Banned |url=https://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-youtube-jokester-gets-banned-1729589265 |website=[[Kotaku]] |access-date=July 5, 2019 |date=September 9, 2015}}</ref> However, he quit making ''League'' videos in September 2015, after he was banned for "toxic" behavior, such as repeatedly insulting other players on his team in the in-game chat.<ref name="Kotaku: Defends"/> Gastrow is also known for popularizing jokes about ''[[Knack (video game)|Knack]]'' (2013) and its sequel ''[[Knack II]]'' (2017), titles for the [[PlayStation 4]], to the point that the games "became the internet's favorite punchline".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jackson |first1=Gita |title=How Knack Became The Internet's Favorite Punchline |url=https://kotaku.com/how-knack-became-the-internets-favorite-punchline-1800943169 |website=[[Kotaku]] |access-date=July 5, 2019 |date=September 6, 2017}}</ref>

Gastrow initially signed a contract with [[Machinima, Inc.]], which took a large cut of his earnings from advertising. In 2013, after revenue declined, Gastrow became increasingly stressed, having just signed an expensive lease for an apartment, and made as many videos as he could. He switched from Machinima to [[Maker Studios]], which promised to pay for the remainder of the lease, but never did and took more revenue than Machinima. [[Microsoft]] offered to pay two months of Gastrow's lease if he made four videos for [[Xbox Live]]'s [[Summer of Arcade]]. Shortly after Gastrow uploaded the first video, in which he lambasted the game he was playing, Microsoft took down the video and canceled the deal. Gastrow has since worked with [[Curse LLC]], which he has praised.<ref name="Microsoft">{{cite AV media|people=Gastrow, Jason|title=Microsoft Sucks|date=October 6, 2015|format=[[YouTube]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeHjN4oWVfk|access-date=September 28, 2019|publisher=videogamedunkey}}</ref> Gastrow reportedly earns up to {{US$}}1.7 million a year,<ref name="WP: Bangs"/> and he is "likely the highest-earning cultural commentator with connections to Madison".<ref name="TM: Jackassery"/>

In December 2020, Gastrow released a video in which he stated he would stop making "good videos" and instead switch to a daily schedule. He subsequently released shorter videos on a daily basis that satirized his stated plans and featured [[clickbait]] titles. For example, a purported ''[[Minecraft]]'' video involved Gastrow playing as the default Steve avatar from ''Minecraft'' in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]''. According to his wife, the switch in content format was because he was "feeling frustrations about the current YouTube landscape and worried about the future", where his and other channels' past curated content has been "overshadowed by the latest trends and low effort stuff" from larger channels. ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' noted that the videos performed better than Gastrow's previous content, anticipating that he was exemplifying the current problems with YouTube to bring the situation to light and would eventually return to his normal curated content.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/7/22160005/dunkey-youtube-among-us-minecraft-trending | title = YouTuber becomes more powerful by pivoting to terrible gaming content | first= Patricia | last = Hernandez | date = December 7, 2020 | access-date = December 7, 2020 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref>

In August 2021, Gastrow joked in a [[live stream]] that [[Kanye West]]'s then-upcoming album ''[[Donda (album)|Donda]]'' would sample a song from the animated short film ''Strawinsky and the Mysterious House'' (2012); upon the album's release, the track "Remote Control" sampled the exact clip, leading fans to theorize that West's team watched Gastrow's stream.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.distractify.com/p/globglogabgalab-kanye |title=Kanye West's "Donda" Album Has a Surprising Animated Character Featured on It: Globglogabgalab |last=Barilla |first=Chris |work=[[Distractify]] |date=August 27, 2021 |accessdate=August 31, 2021 }}</ref>

==Views and style==
According to Gastrow, while sometimes he writes a script for a video and records [[voice-over]]s during post-production, other times he records himself while he plays. Gastrow's videos depicting ''League of Legends'' and ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'' (2016) are examples of the latter; he stated in an interview that he "would try to cut out the funniest parts."<ref name="h3: Podcast"/> Gastrow's most viewed video, "Ultimate ''Skyrim''", depicts him playing ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' (2011) using a variety of user-created [[modding|modifications]] to the point of breaking the game.<ref name="WP: Bangs"/> Gastrow has cited people he knows, [[Adult Swim]] television series such as ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'', ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'', and the [[Tim & Eric]] shows as inspiration, and has said he enjoys watching videos by YouTubers ProJared and Gaming Historian.<ref name="h3: Podcast"/>

According to ''Tone Madison''{{'s}} Reid Kurkerewicz, Gastrow is an example of "new games criticism", a reviewing approach inspired by [[New Journalism]]. While most of Gastrow's videos are intended to be humorous, he makes serious ones as well.<ref>{{Cite web|last=videogame|first=dunkey|title=Serious Videos (With No Jokes) Playlist|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvPkAYT6B1Q&list=PLMBTl5yXyrGQfhjt0Efk3LWo7cmxk41n9|url-status=live|website=Youtube}}</ref> Gastrow has been noted as a "fierce consumer advocate, deeply skeptical of corporate marketing machines."<ref name="WP: Bangs"/> For instance, he has criticized [[Nintendo]] for demonetizing his review of ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' (2017) on copyright grounds,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Alexander |first1=Julia |title=YouTubers are calling out Nintendo for its policy on streaming, uploads |url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/6/16612080/youtube-nintendo-super-mario-odyssey-demonetization |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |access-date=September 28, 2019 |date=November 6, 2017}}</ref> and Microsoft for its business practices, including the cancellation of their Summer of Arcade deal.<ref name="Microsoft"/> In his 2017 video "Game Critics", Gastrow denounced websites such as ''[[IGN]]'' for their decentralized opinions, poor writing, "the fuzzy ethics of building relationships with the companies [they're] meant to cover," and the divide between critics and audiences.<ref name="WP: Bangs"/><ref name="ViceCritics">{{cite web |last1=Klepek |first1=Patrick |title=Game Criticism Had Problems Long Before Dunkey Made a Video About It |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvpzk3/game-criticism-had-problems-long-before-dunkey-made-a-video-about-it |website=[[Vice Media|Vice]] |access-date=September 28, 2019 |date=July 11, 2017}}</ref>

==Reputation==
Gene Park of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' described Gastrow as one of the most influential critics on YouTube, noting he has inspired a number of imitators, and called him the [[Lester Bangs]] of video games. Like Bangs, Park wrote, Gastrow is an industry outsider, has created modern vernacular, and is an advocate for consumers.<ref name="WP: Bangs"/> Patrick Klepek, writing for ''[[Vice Media|Vice]]'', said Gastrow is one of the few YouTubers he subscribes to, calling him "a video editing maestro whose ability to make you laugh and understand why a game's interesting at the same time is unmatched. Even my wife, who barely plays games, loves Dunkey."<ref name="ViceCritics"/> Gastrow's ban from ''League of Legends'' for verbal abuse divided his followers; some defended him while others expressed surprise he considered insulting other players acceptable.<ref name="Kotaku: Defends"/>

==Personal life==
Gastrow was born on January 30, 1991.<ref>{{cite tweet |last=Gastrow |first=Jason |user=vgdunkey |number=693652769463336961 |date=January 30, 2016 |title=thanks everybody for an awesome birthday ! |access-date=July 4, 2019 }}</ref><ref name="WP: Bangs">{{cite web |last1=Park |first1=Gene |title=If video games are today's rock-and-roll music, Videogamedunkey might be its Lester Bangs |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/03/14/if-video-games-are-todays-rock-and-roll-music-videogamedunkey-might-be-its-lester-bangs/ |website=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=July 4, 2019 |date=March 14, 2019}}</ref> He has lived in [[Milwaukee]]<ref name="TR: 9Best">{{cite web |last1=Rowlatt |first1=Henrietta |title=9 of the best YouTubers playing PC games today |url=https://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/10-of-the-best-youtubers-playing-pc-games-today-1320452 |website=[[TechRadar]] |access-date=July 4, 2019 |date=May 10, 2016}}</ref> and [[Madison, Wisconsin]].<ref name="TM: Jackassery"/> Gastrow's mother is a [[second grade]] teacher.<ref name="h3: Podcast"/> In September 2019, Gastrow married fellow [[YouTuber]] Leah Bee.<ref>{{cite AV media|people=Gastrow, Jason|date=September 27, 2019|title=Dunkey and Leah's Wedding|format=[[YouTube]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waXb8QGdEYQ&t=77s|publisher=videogamedunkey|access-date=September 28, 2019}}</ref> 

It is a common misconception and a running gag on the channel that Gastrow is [[black people|black]], which Bee attributes to his voice and the fact that he rarely shows his face in videos.<ref name="h3: Podcast">{{cite AV media|people=Klein, Ethan; Klein, Hila; Gastrow, Jason; Bee, Leah|date=October 11, 2017|title=H3 Podcast #34 - VideoGameDunkey & Leah|format=[[YouTube]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph5FR-RFhbg|publisher=[[h3h3Productions]]|access-date=July 5, 2019}}</ref>
