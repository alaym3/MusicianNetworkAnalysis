'''Howard Kern Day''' (born January 15, 1981) is an American singer-songwriter. Beginning his career as a solo artist in the late 1990s, Day became known for his extensive touring and in-concert use of [[sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]] and [[effects unit|effects pedals]] to accompany himself.<ref name="LAWeekly">{{cite web |last=Duff |first=S.L. |url=https://www.laweekly.com/will-jam-4-food/ |date=April 3, 2002 |title=Will Jam 4 Food |website=[[LA Weekly]] |access-date=December 22, 2019}}</ref> He self-financed and self-released his first album, ''[[Australia (Howie Day album)|Australia]]'', in 2000. 
 
Day eventually signed a recording contract with major label [[Epic Records]] in 2002 and has since re-released his debut as well as producing a follow-up, ''[[Stop All The World Now]]''. Despite initially sluggish sales, ''Stop All The World Now'' was certified gold in early 2005,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://theedge.bostonherald.com/musicNews/view.bg?articleid=81833 |title=Hotline: Finally it's gold for Howie |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050524230900/http://theedge.bostonherald.com/musicNews/view.bg?articleid=81833 |archive-date=May 24, 2005 |work=The Boston Herald |date=May 6, 2005 |access-date=April 27, 2006}}</ref> and has produced a number of singles, including the hits "[[She Says (Howie Day song)|She Says]]" and "[[Collide (Howie Day song)|Collide]]", Day's most successful to date.<ref>{{cite web |last=Eisen |first=Benji |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/howieday/articles/story/7318029/howie_day_meets_world |title=Howie Day Meets World |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=May 18, 2005|access-date=April 27, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027132607/https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/howieday/articles/story/7318029/howie_day_meets_world |archive-date=October 27, 2007}}</ref> "Collide" later became Epic Records' first platinum single, eventually selling 1.5&nbsp;million downloads.

After a five-year tour before the release of ''Stop All The World Now'' followed by a three-year tour, Day took some time off and focused on writing music.  Day released his ''Be There'' EP in May 2009 followed by ''Sound The Alarm'', released on September 8, 2009. In December 2014, Day created a PledgeMusic campaign to fund a new album, Lanterns, which was released to pledgers on April 16, 2015. The album was released on iTunes April 28, 2015. Several songs on the album feature Aimee Mann on backing vocals.

== Early years==
Born in [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]], Maine and raised in [[Brewer, Maine|Brewer]], Howie Day began to play music at age five when his mother bought a piano at an auction.<ref>{{cite web |last=Price |first=Nancy J.|url=http://sheknows.com/about/look/4487.htm |title=Howie Day talks music, recording, performing. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027122023/http://www.sheknows.com/about/look/4487.htm |archive-date=October 27, 2007 |website=SheKnows.com |access-date=April 11, 2006}}</ref> When Day's mother noticed that her son was able to play by ear tunes of television advertising jingles, she enrolled him in piano lessons, which he would continue for six years.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}He attended Brewer High School.

==Career==
At around age 13, Day's interest drifted toward rock music and the electric guitar. His father bought him a [[Fender Stratocaster]] and enrolled him in basic vocal training. His parents owned and ran a popular local restaurant, which gave Day a public arena in which to start performing, playing every Friday night for patrons. Day made his first stage appearance in August 1996 at Bangor restaurant Captain Nick's.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hostetter |first=Shane |url=http://howiefan.com/Articles.php?view=350 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614052104/http://howiefan.com/Articles.php?view=350 |archive-date=June 14, 2006 |title=A Day with Howie, snow or no snow |date=March 27, 2001 |access-date=April 11, 2006}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2009}} Day played in a local band called ''Route 66'' throughout 1997 and made sporadic solo appearances in local venues until booking agent Shawn Radley discovered him the following year while Day was supporting [[Ziggy Marley]] at the [[University of Maine]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Roberge |first=Nicole |url=http://www.songwriteruniverse.com/howieday.htm |title=Howie Day Builds Following With Acclaimed CD Stop All The World Now, & Strong Live Shows |date=July 8, 2004|website=Songwriter Universe |access-date=April 11, 2006}}</ref> Radley became Day's manager in June 1998, and he began touring more extensively, leading him to miss 45 days of school and to almost fail his senior year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/yhif/howie_day/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305075404/http://www.mtv.com/news/yhif/howie_day/ |archive-date=March 5, 2005 |title=Howie Day: You Hear it First |website=MTV.com |access-date=April 11, 2006}}</ref>

===''Howie Day'' EP (1998)===
At some point in 1998, Day recorded his first demo EP, which contained covers of songs by [[Dave Matthews Band]], [[Barenaked Ladies]], and [[Goo Goo Dolls]] in a Ryan Miller (Guster) like style alongside the originals "Buzzing" and "Lick My Lips." This EP was followed later in 1998 by another demo consisting wholly of Day's originals.

On the strength of these performances and demos, Radley secured Day a showcase at the annual [[National Association for Campus Activities]] Convention, where he played for 1,500 [[University|college]] talent buyers.<ref name="LAWeekly" /> Having received around four months of bookings at colleges around the United States, Day decided to defer attending college in favor of his burgeoning music career.

Day recorded a cover of [[The Beatles]]' "[[Help! (song)|Help!]]" for the [[I Am Sam (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to the 2001 film ''[[I Am Sam (film)|I Am Sam]]''.

===''Australia'' (2000)===
Day's first full-length album, ''Australia'', was self-financed and independently released. It was named "Best Debut Album" at the 2001 Boston Music Awards. Fans consider it to be one of his best and most authentic works, with follow-up albums ''Stop All The World Now'' and ''Sound the Alarm'' as having a more commercial, polished sound and feel.

===''Stop All the World Now'' (2003)===
[[File:Howiedaycrouching.jpg|thumb|Howie Day adjusting pedals at the Point in [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, PA]] circa 2004.]]  
After the EP's release, Day relocated to [[London, England|London]], England to record ''Australia''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s follow up, which was provisionally titled ''From a Northern Sky''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.howiefan.com/View_Album.php?id=734 |website=howiefan.com |title=Discography: Stop All the World Now (Special Edition)<!-- Bot generated title --> |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422013727/http://www.howiefan.com/View_Album.php?id=734 |archive-date=April 22, 2006 }}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2009}} The album, which would eventually become ''[[Stop All The World Now]]'', was recorded in London's famous [[Olympic Studios]] with [[Martin Glover|Martin "Youth" Glover]], the bassist for British band [[Killing Joke]], whose previous production credits included [[The Verve]]'s ''[[Urban Hymns]]'', one of Day's favorite albums.

While certain tracks on ''Australia'' had featured session musicians, ''Stop All The World Now'' saw Day joined for the first time by a permanent backing band, consisting of multi-instrumentalist [[Les Hall]], drummer Laurie Jenkins, Drummer [[Mark Heaney]], and ex-Verve bassist [[Simon Jones (musician)|Simon Jones]]. In addition, the majority of the album's songs were co-written with either [[Better than Ezra]] frontman [[Kevin Griffin]] or [[Jump, Little Children|Jump Little Children's]] [[Jay Clifford]].

A full band tour to promote ''Stop All the World Now'' began on September 27, 2003. Due to other commitments, Simon Jones was unable to tour with the group and was replaced by Jeremy Curtis. The album was released one week and three days later on October 7 to tepid critical reactions. ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s Pat Blashill referred to ''Stop'' as "not bad" but "indistinct,"<ref>{{cite web |last=Blashill |first=Pat |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/howieday/albums/album/292135/review/5942595 |title=Album reviews. Howie Day — Stop All The World Now |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=November 13, 2003|access-date=April 12, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602165758/https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/howieday/albums/album/292135/review/5942595 |archive-date=June 2, 2007}}</ref> but ''Popmatters''{{'}} [[Devon Powers]] noted that though ''Australia'' had been an album one falls for passionately, "''Stop All the World Now'' is an album you have a crush on, not one you fall deeply, complexly, and foolishly in love with. And crushes have a way of disappearing suddenly, without a trace."<ref>{{cite web |last=Powers |first=Devon |url=https://www.popmatters.com/dayhowie-stopall-2495882884.html |title=Howie Day: Stop All The World Now |date=January 8, 2004|website=Popmatters.com |access-date=December 22, 2019}}</ref>

Sales of ''Stop'' were initially sluggish, but slowly began to rise beginning in late 2004 with the single release of ballad "Collide", which became a popular radio hit and was featured on TV shows such as ''[[Cold Case (TV series)|Cold Case]]'', ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'', and ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' as well as soundtracking a promotional trailer for the [[Pride & Prejudice (2005 film)|2005 film adaptation]] of [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''. ''Stop'' was finally certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] in early 2005. Fan favorite "She Says", which was first released on 1998's ''White EP'', was released as a follow-up to "Collide."

Boosted by the slow burning success of ''Stop All the World Now'', Epic released the ''Live From...'' EP on December 6, 2005. The 7-track EP contains live renditions of songs from ''Australia'' and ''Stop All the World Now'' as well as a cover of [[Crowded House]]'s "Don't Dream It's Over". The EP has not been widely reviewed, though [[Allmusic]] referred to the release as "holiday market product," "tepid", and "directionless".{{ref|AMG_Live}}

===''Be There'' EP (2009)===

Day released an EP, introducing his new album, featuring three new songs: "Be There", "40 Hours", and "Counting On Me". These tracks were available on iTunes. "Be There", produced by [[Kevin Griffin]], [[Mike Flynn (producer)|Mike Flynn]], and [[Warren Huart]], was serviced to radio as the first single from the album.

===''Sound the Alarm'' (2009)===
Day released his third full-length album, ''Sound the Alarm'' under the [[Epic Records|Epic]] music label on September 8, 2009.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://tommy2.net/content/?p=7061 |title=July 19th, 2009 |website=Tommy2.net}}</ref> After an extensive tour schedule following the release of ''Stop'', Day decided to take some time off, during which he sorted through his emotions by writing songs, many of which have made their way onto ''Sound the Alarm''. "I toured for five years straight before ''Stop All The World Now'' came out, then for three years non-stop after it was released," Day says.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.howieday.com}}</ref>

To get his desired range of sounds and moods, Day recorded in a variety of locations, including Los Angeles, New York ([[Joel Hamilton]]), London, Minneapolis, and Bloomington, Indiana, between the spring of 2006 and fall of 2008. He also collaborated with several musicians and producers, including Martin Terefe ([[Jason Mraz]], [[KT Tunstall]]), Mike Denneen ([[Aimee Mann]], [[Fountains of Wayne]]), Mike Flynn ([[The Fray]], [[Augustana (band)|Augustana]]), Warren Huart (The Fray, Augustana, [[Better Than Ezra]]) and Kevin Griffin.
"Be There" and "Longest Night" have been used in the CW show ''[[The Vampire Diaries]]''.

=== ''Ceasefire'' EP (2011)===
Consisting of tracks that were left off ''Sound the Alarm'', the ''Ceasefire'' EP was released on June 29, 2011.

=== ''Lanterns'' (2015) ===
[[File:Howie Day 2013.jpg|thumb|Day performing in 2013]]
Day created a [[PledgeMusic]] campaign in December 2014 to fund a new album, ''Lanterns'', which was released to pledgers on April 16, 2015.<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web|url=http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/howieday |title=Howie Day: The New Album On PledgeMusic |website=PledgeMusic.com}}</ref> The album was released on iTunes April 28, 2015. When asked about taking the PledgeMusic avenue, Day said "It not only helped pay some of the studio bill, it was also really encouraging to have the fans’ behind me during the process. I am incredibly grateful."<ref>{{cite web |title=INTERVIEW: HOWIE DAY, November 2016 |url=https://100percentrock.com/interviews/201611/209024 |website=100 Percent Rock Magazine}}</ref> Day's loyal fan base have given mostly favorable reviews. Several songs on the album feature [[Aimee Mann]] on backing vocals.

=== Parody of "Collide" at CERN ===
In 2015, members of the [[CERN]] wrote a parody of "Collide", describing the experiments of the Large Hadron Collider from the point of view of a proton. After hearing the parody, Day came to visit CERN and recorded a cover of the parody of his own song, complete with a clip filmed on site in the tunnels of LHC and in front of the [[ATLAS detector]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sundermier |first1=Ali |title=Howie Day records love song to physics |url=https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/howie-day-records-love-song-to-physics |website=Symmetry Magazine |access-date=December 22, 2019 |date=June 23, 2017}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Day received significant negative attention after two high-profile arrests. In 2004, Day was arrested and charged over an incident in which he was accused of locking a female fan in the toilet of his tour bus and destroying the [[mobile phone|cellular phone]] of another, for which he was fined.<ref>{{cite news |last=Treleven |first=Ed |url= <!-- wrong url here, duplicated previous reference --> |title=Singer Fined For Trapping Woman On Bus |work=Wisconsin State Journal |access-date=<!-- April 12, 2006 -->}}</ref> In December 2005, Day was arrested in [[Boston]] after reportedly verbally abusing the flight crew while under the influence of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and [[hypnotic|sleeping pills]]. He was sentenced to one year's probation on April 26, 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/local/BO18511/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501042036/http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/local/BO18511/ |archive-date=May 1, 2006 |title=Pop singer Howie Day gets probation in flight rowdiness case |date=April 26, 2006 |website=[[WHDH (TV)|WHDH]]|agency=The Associated Press |access-date=April 27, 2006}}</ref>

In a 2013 interview, Day reflected on his younger experiences by saying, "I was a kid from Maine who went from zero to 380 in about two seconds, so it was kind of overwhelming. But that's no excuse. I drank a bit too much. A lot of kids run wild, but it’s a big difference when people know who you are."<ref>{{cite news |last=Routhier |first=Ray |url=https://www.pressherald.com/2013/11/21/older_and_wiser_howie_day_takes_control_of_his_music_/ |title=Older and wiser Howie Day takes control of his music |date=November 21, 2013|work=[[Portland Press Herald]] |access-date=December 22, 2019 }}</ref>

In April 2018, Day was charged with fourth-degree assault for shoving his girlfriend, Carrie Pencek.<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=October 16, 2021|date=August 26, 2019|first=Jordan|last=Runtagh|title='Collide' Singer Howie Day Arrested for Assaulting Ex-Girlfriend in New York City: Report|url=https://people.com/music/howie-day-arrested-assault-ex-girlfriend/|work=People}}</ref> Day was arrested for assaulting Pencek a second time in August 2019.
