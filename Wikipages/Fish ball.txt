{{Cuisine of China}}
'''Fish balls''' are rounded meat balls made from [[fish paste]] which are then [[boiled]] or [[deep fried]]. Similar in composition to [[fishcake]], fish balls are often made from fish mince or [[surimi]], salt, and a culinary [[Binder (material)|binder]] such as tapioca flour, corn, or potato starch.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dZIUCT2GdLwC&dq=difference+between+fish+ball+and+fish+cake&pg=PA194|title=Commodity Classifications Under the Harmonized System|date=1990|publisher=Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service|pages=194|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=akYLOTMdCSEC&dq=difference+between+fish+ball+and+fish+cake&pg=PA166|title=IFIS Dictionary of Food Science and Technology|collaboration=[[International Food Information Service]]|date=2009-05-18|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-8740-4|pages=166|language=en}}</ref>

Fish balls are popular in East and Southeast Asia,<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Ang|first1=Catharina Y.

Nordic countries also have their own variation.  
{{TOC limit|4}}

== Production ==
There are two variants of fish balls, each differing in its textures, production method, and primary regions of production:

=== Asia ===
While the ingredients and methods are similar between countries, differences can be noted in terms of elasticity, colour, and flavour. Fish balls in Hong Kong and the Philippines can be more firm, darker, and have more fishy taste and aroma than their Malay and Singaporean counterparts.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Park|first=Jae W.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KkduBwAAQBAJ&dq=difference+between+fish+ball+and+fish+cake&pg=PA388|title=Surimi and Surimi Seafood|date=2005-03-29|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-2804-1|edition=2|pages=388|language=en}}</ref> Taiwanese fish balls have more bounce and more air incorporated to allow for soaking up soups or sauces.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Maggie Hiufu Wong|title=40 of the best Taiwanese foods and drinks|url=https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/40-taiwan-food/index.html|access-date=2021-09-18|website=CNN|language=en}}</ref>

Typically fish are shredded, coarsely ground, or pounded, then undergo prolonged mixing with added salt and crushed ice until a smooth texture is attained. Other ingredients are added, such as sugar, [[monosodium glutamate]], [[Transglutaminase]], or starches, and then water is added to ensure the ball has a "soft, springy texture." This technique, similar to the process of making surimi, uncoils and stretches previously wound and tangled protein strands in the fish, which produces food with a firm "bouncy" texture.

In commercial production, the balls are shaped by an extruding machine, and set in water between 30 and 45C before boiling, cooling, then packaging.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|287, 291}} The setting time is an important part of manufacture because in addition to giving it a translucent appearance, the shape will be maintained after packaging. They can be sold as uncooked (after setting), boiled, or fried (after being boiled).<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|291–293}}

The variety of fish used in surimi can effect commercial fish ball production, due to the difference in thermal stability between tropical fish and cold water fish.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|290}} Economically, fish ball production adds value to lower-priced fish.<ref>{{Cite book|last=al|first=Silvestre, G. et|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JzW4DQAAQBAJ&dq=fish+ball&pg=PA860|title=Assessment, management and future directions for coastal fisheries in Asian countries|date=2003-12-08|publisher=WorldFish|isbn=978-983-2346-22-7|pages=860|language=en}}</ref>

=== Europe ===
[[Scandinavia]]n fish balls are made of completely pureed fish, milk, and potato flour (or potato starch), and they are shaped without additional processing, which produces a softer textured food. This type of fish ball usually comes in metal cans or transparent plastic containers containing stock or brine and also requires a setting period prior to canning.<ref name=":2" />

=== Shelf life ===
Fish balls are perishable, and have a different [[shelf life]] based on the amount of processing and the inclusion of additives. Uncooked fish balls have a shelf life of 4 to 5 days when stored at 5&nbsp;°C.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kok|first1=Tiong N.|last2=Park|first2=Jae W.|date=2007|title=Extending the Shelf Life of Set Fish Ball|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1745-4557.2007.00103.x|journal=Journal of Food Quality|volume=30|pages=1–27|doi=10.1111/j.1745-4557.2007.00103.x|issn=1745-4557}}</ref> A fried, marinated fish ball can last up to 135 days at ±4&nbsp;°C.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kaba|first1=N|last2=Corapci|first2=B|last3=Eryasar|first3=K|last4=Yücel|first4=S|last5=Yesilayer|first5=N|date=2014|title=Determination of Shelf Life of Fish Ball Marinated after frying Process|journal=Italian Journal of Food Science|volume=26|issue=2|pages=162–168}}</ref>

=== Mislabeling issues ===
While fish balls can contain other seafood or meat products (such as squid, cuttlefish, or shrimp balls), studies conducted on processed seafood have revealed significant amounts of mislabeling. A 2017 study in Italy and Spain detected mollusks used in surimi products, which is a concern for shellfish allergies.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Hellberg|first1=Rosalee S.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dZThDwAAQBAJ&dq=difference+between+fish+ball+and+fish+cake&pg=PA115|title=Food Fraud: A Global Threat with Public Health and Economic Consequences|last2=Everstine|first2=Karen|last3=Sklare|first3=Steven A.|date=2020-11-30|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-817243-8|pages=115|language=en}}</ref> A 2013–2016 study in the Philippines that identified the genetic code of a variety of fish balls concluded that large, well established companies generally adhered to labelling standards, but unknown, small producers typically supplying street hawkers revealed seafood balls that contained pig or chicken meat.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Sarmiento|first1=Katreena|last2=Santos|first2=Mudjekeewis Dalisay|last3=Ventolero|first3=Minerva Fatimae|last4=Pereda|first4=Jacqueline Marjorie R.|date=May 2018|title=Not fish in fish balls: fraud in some processed seafood products detected by using DNA barcoding|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326260980|url-status=live|access-date=2021-09-18|website=ResearchGate|language=en}}</ref> A 2019 study by the [[National University of Singapore]] showed a 7.8% mislabeling rate for single-type seafood products, and 38.5% mislabeling for products containing multiple meat sources. The study also identified seafood balls containing pig DNA, although none of the samples were labeled as a [[Halal]] or [[Kosher foods|Kosher food]], which would pose a significant concern for the country's Muslim population.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Pig DNA found in cuttlefish and prawn balls: NUS researchers|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/pig-dna-found-cuttlefish-and-prawn-balls-nus-researchers|access-date=2021-09-18|website=TODAYonline}}</ref>

== Regional variations ==
=== China and countries with predominant Chinese populations ===
==== Mainland China ====
Fish balls have a long history in China, and the introduction of fish balls throughout Asia is often attributed to Chinese immigrants. Fish balls in China are made of "surimi, starch, egg white, fat, garlic juice, spring onion juice". Fish balls can also contain a wide array of seafood and other meats such as beef or pork.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|288}}

In [[Hubei]], fish balls are made from freshwater fish surimi. A [[Fuzhou]] variety ({{lang|zh|福州鱼丸}}) is made from fish with a minced pork filling.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=December 2019|title=Fujian Snacks.|url=https://web-a-ebscohost-com.wikipedialibrary.idm.oclc.org/ehost/detail/detail?vid=24&sid=142b8f77-e30a-4a11-8082-f99e5a329797%40sdc-v-sessmgr02&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=139982840&db=a9h|journal=China Today|volume=68|issue=12|pages=61|via=EBSCO}}</ref><ref name=":0" />{{Rp|289}} The variation from [[Fuqing]] is much larger. Shark is also used, about 50% of shark caught in China is used for fish ball production with a small amount used for export.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Vannuccini|first=Stefania|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43695354|title=Shark utilization, marketing, and trade|date=1999|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|others=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|isbn=92-5-104361-2|location=Rome|pages=80|oclc=43695354}}</ref>

Tengxin Foods ([[Fujian]]) is one of China's largest fishball factories, covering 30% market share.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|289}}

==== Hong Kong and Macau ====
Fish balls are one of Hong Kong's most popular and representative "street foods", eaten plain or cooked in a curry sauce.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-01-29|title=Where to go to eat Hong Kong's best fish balls|url=https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/travel-food/article/2183925/where-go-eat-hong-kongs-best-fish-balls|access-date=2021-09-18|website=South China Morning Post|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite web|date=2020-09-05|title=The humble fishball: the iconic street food that is Hong Kong|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3100227/iconic-snack-hong-kong-humble-fishball-mirrors-citys-highs|access-date=2021-09-18|website=South China Morning Post|language=en}}</ref> Readily available in traditional markets and supermarkets, fish balls are also a popular ingredient in [[hot pot]].

[[Flathead mullet]] ({{zh|t=九棍魚/烏仔魚|labels=no}}) and [[Daggertooth pike conger]] ({{zh|t=門鱔|labels=no}}) are common fish varieties used for fish balls. Originally they were likely made by mixing and frying the remaining materials of Chaozhou fish ball ({{lang|zh|潮州白魚丸}}) or stale fish, although more recently they are mainly imported by wholesalers and the texture is more consistent.<ref>《50經典小吃》刊於2003/01/10《飲食男女》</ref>[[File:Fish ball and fish meat slice.jpg|thumb|Fish balls from a local fish ball store at Cheung Chau, Hong Kong]]
There are three kinds of fish balls, known as {{zh|t=魚蛋|labels=no}} (literally "fish eggs"), sold in Hong Kong and Macau. They are yellow, white, and golden. Yellow fish balls are most commonly sold as street food. White fish balls are larger in size and made with white fish, such as Spanish mackerel, with an elastic (bouncy) and fluffy texture and a strong taste of fish. This kind is usually served to complement [[noodle]]s at [[Teochew cuisine|Cháozhōu-style]] [[noodle]] restaurants,<ref>Man, Joyce [http://www.cnngo.com/hong-kong/eat/tse-kee-fish-balls-831604 "Aberdeen's best fish ball shop to close"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229000121/http://www.cnngo.com/hong-kong/eat/tse-kee-fish-balls-831604 |date=29 February 2012 }} ''CNN Go''. 24 February 2012. Retrieved 4 March 2012</ref> and at some ''[[cha chaan teng]]s'', which also sell [[beef ball]]s ({{lang|zh|牛丸}}) and [[cuttlefish]] balls ({{zh|t=墨魚丸|labels=no}}). White fish balls from traditional fish ball restaurants are made from fresh fish and are normally hand-made ({{lang|zh|手打}}) by the owners using traditional techniques. Golden fish ball is a snack in [[Cheung Chau]]. Distinguishing features include size, sauce and texture. They can be fist-sized and are served with a special curry sauce, and they are mainly made from fresh fish which makes the texture more smooth.

During the 1970's and 80's, [[Fish ball girl]] became a euphamism for underage female sex workers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mac|first=Gladys|date=June 2019|title=Golden Chicken as Historicomedy: Sex Work in Hong Kong and Local Popular Culture|journal=The Quint|publisher=[[University College of the North]]|volume=11|pages=116–117|issn=1920-1028}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Liao|first=Sara|title=Hong Kong Net-Bar Youth Gaming: A Labeling Perspective|date=2016|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-43820-7_7|work=Transnational Contexts of Development History, Sociality, and Society of Play|pages=193, 205|editor-last=Lee|editor-first=S.

==== Taiwan ====
Milkfish balls ({{lang|zh|虱目魚丸}}) are frequently found in Taiwan.  The natural texture and aroma of the [[milkfish]] give this variant a unique taste.  This is one of the main ways milkfishes' lesser-prized yet highly abundant white meat is consumed. Other fishes used include shark, lizard fish, [[pike eel]], and [[marlin]].<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|298}}

Fish balls with roe ({{lang|zh|魚包蛋}}) are served at hot pot restaurants. They have a sweet and salty taste with a popping element from the roe's texture. There is also a fried golden version.

==== Singapore ====
[[File:MeePok.JPG|thumb|Mee pok sold in Singapore]]
In Singapore, fish balls are also known as known as 鱼圆 (yú yuán) or 魚丸 (yú wán).

Traditionally, fish balls were made from locally sourced fish such as [[coral fish]] and [[Dorab wolf-herring|Dorab]]. Production scale varies from individual hawker stalls to large corporate factories which supply the local and export markets. Due to higher labour costs and limited local fish supplies, surimi are mostly imported, and fish balls are produced at a lower cost by mixing surimi with fresh leached fish mince. Higher quality fish balls are made from [[wolf herring]], [[coral fish]], [[Spanish mackerel]], and [[Conger eel]].<ref name=":0" />{{RP|286-287}}

As of 2002, Singapore consumes approximately 10&nbsp;kg of fish balls per capita per year, possibly the country with the highest consumption of fish balls in the world.<ref name=":0" />{{RP|286-287}} They can be served with soup and noodles like the [[Chaozhou|Chiuchow]] style or with ''[[yong tau foo]]'' ({{lang|zh|酿豆腐}}). They can also be served with noodles called ''[[mee pok]]''.

''[[Mee pok#Bak chor mee|Bak chor mee]]'', a popular Singaporean dish which comes in both dry and soup versions, was listed as the top world street food by World Street Food Congress.<ref name="about.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.asiaone.com/food/singapores-bak-chor-mee-tops-world-street-food-list?amp|title=Singapore's bak chor mee tops world street food list|access-date=5 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704011033/http://www.asiaone.com/food/singapores-bak-chor-mee-tops-world-street-food-list?amp |archive-date=4 July 2017 |author=Lam Min Lee}}</ref> In some cases, it is also fried and served on a stick.

=== Europe ===

==== Northern Europe ====
Known as ''Fiskbullar'' in [[Sweden]] and ''fiskeboller'' in [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]], Nordic fish balls are white and without breading.

* In [[Norway]], fish balls ({{lang|nb|fiskeboller}}<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HhxT9V5CQM4C&dq=difference+between+fish+ball+and+fish+cake&pg=PA74|title=Multilingual Dictionary of Fish and Fish Products|collaboration=[[OECD]]|date=2009-09-24|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-1942-2|pages=74|language=fr}}</ref>) are made using wheat and potato flour, milk, fish broth, salt and seasonings.

The sauce is often made with the stock from the container, sometimes with mild [[Madras curry]] seasoning as a condiment, or mixed to create curry sauce. Adding [[ketchup]] to the sauce is commonplace among children. Tiny fish balls called ''suppeboller'' (literally "soup balls") are also common in [[fish soup]]. ''Sideboller'' is made from [[coal-fish]].<ref name=":1" />
* In Sweden, {{lang|sv|fiskbullar}} are normally served with mashed potatoes or rice, boiled green peas and dill, [[caviar]] or seafood sauces.
* In [[Iceland]] has two varieties; {{lang|is|Fiskbollur}} {{IPA-is|ˈfɪskˌpɔllʏr̥|}}<!-- not with tl, apparently --> is very similar to those of Norway and Sweden,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aha.is/en/ora-fiskibollur-1-2-dos-193258|title=Ora Fiskibollur 1/2 dós|access-date=2021-04-17}}</ref> whereas {{lang|is|Fiskibollur}} {{IPA-is|ˈfɪscɪˌpɔllʏr̥|}} are fried brown in a pan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heimkaup.is/grimur-kokkur-fiskibollur-1-kg|title=Grímur Kokkur Fiskibollur 1 kg|language=is|access-date=2021-04-17}}</ref> Both varieties are served with boiled potatoes, carrots, lettuce, and either bechamel or Madras curry sauce.
* In the [[Faroe Islands]], fish balls are called ''knettir'' and are made with groundfish and mutton fat.

==== Germany ====
German fish balls, known locally as {{lang|de|fischklößchen}}, rely heavily on herbs and herb sauces.

[[Gefilte fish]], typical of [[Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine]], has origins in 14th century non-Jewish Germanic cookery. Originally a stuffed fish dish, it suited the dietary cultural needs for Jewish celebrations, being an acceptable form of meat as well as already deboned which adheres to the restriction on picking through bones on the [[Sabbath]]. Jewish communities have their own versions based on local ingredients, such as the addition of sugar in Poland, black pepper in Lithuania, and cooking it in a tomato sauce in Libya.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2013-03-18|title=Beyond Gefilte Fish|url=https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/food/articles/beyond-gefilte-fish|access-date=2021-09-18|website=Tablet Magazine|language=en}}</ref>

==== England ====
A classic English variant (as well as in the US) uses cooked mashed potato and egg as a binder, and is pan fried. Cod is a popular fish for this style.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Escoffier|first=Auguste|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KCbkcXHj7qoC&dq=difference+between+fish+ball+and+fish+cake&pg=PA351|title=A Guide to Modern Cookery|date=2013-06-06|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-06350-0|pages=351|language=en}}</ref> "The Lone Fish-ball" was published in 1855 by [[George Martin Lane]] referencing this type of fish ball popular in New England.<ref>{{Cite web|last=V|first=Primus|date=2009-05-01|title=Song for Hard Times|url=https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2009/05/song-hard-times|access-date=2021-09-18|website=Harvard Magazine|language=en}}</ref>
