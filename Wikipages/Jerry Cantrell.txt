====Reunion and new albums (2005–present)====
Although never officially disbanding, Alice in Chains was plagued by extended inactivity from 1996 onwards due to Staley's [[substance abuse]], which resulted in his death in 2002. The band reformed in 2005 when drummer Sean Kinney had the idea to reunite the surviving members<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1496882/ex-alice-in-chains-members-enlist-damageplan-singer-others-for-benefit/|title=Ex-Alice In Chains Members Enlist Damageplan Singer, Others For Benefit |work=MTV News|date=February 11, 2005|access-date=November 24, 2017}}</ref> to perform a benefit concert for the victims of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|tsunami disaster]] that struck South Asia in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/entertainment/music/article/Kinney-drums-up-enthusiastic-response-for-tsunami-1166652.php|title=Kinney drums up enthusiastic response for tsunami benefit |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=February 17, 2005|access-date=November 24, 2017}}</ref> On February 18, 2005, Cantrell, Mike Inez and Sean Kinney reunited to perform for the first time in 10 years as Alice in Chains at the ''K-Rock Tsunami Continued Care Relief Concert'' in Seattle.<ref name="Benefit concert">{{cite news| author=Hay, Travis |date=February 21, 2005 |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/pop/212872_alice21q.html |title=Alice in Chains owns stage in tsunami-relief show full of surprises |publisher=Seattlepi.com|access-date=July 8, 2017}}</ref> The band featured [[Damageplan]] vocalist [[Pat Lachman]], as well as other special guests including [[Maynard James Keenan]] of [[Tool (band)|Tool]], [[Wes Scantlin]] from [[Puddle of Mudd]] and [[Ann Wilson]] of [[Heart (band)|Heart]].<ref name="Benefit concert"/><ref name="AIC guests">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10518215/latest_news_jayz_the_strokes_r_kelly_and_more |title=Metallica man joins Alice in Chains |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=June 9, 2006 |access-date=November 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613024237/https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10518215/latest_news_jayz_the_strokes_r_kelly_and_more |archive-date=June 13, 2006 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> A few months after that concert, the band called their former manager Susan Silver and Cantrell's manager [[Bill Siddons]] and said they wanted to tour as Alice in Chains again.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pollstarpro.com/live2010/panelband.htm|title=Putting The Band Back Together|work=PollstarPro|date=February 17, 2010|access-date=November 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204214139/http://www.pollstarpro.com/live2010/panelband.htm|archive-date=February 4, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On March 10, 2006, Cantrell, Inez and Kinney performed at [[VH1]]'s [[Decades Rock Live]] concert, honoring fellow Seattle musicians Ann and [[Nancy Wilson (rock musician)|Nancy Wilson]] of Heart.

Cantrell explained the band's reunion saying, "We want to celebrate what we did and the memory of our friend. We have played with some [singers] who can actually bring it and add their own thing to it without being a Layne clone. We're not interested in stepping on [Staley's] rich legacy. It's a tough thing to go through. Do you take the [[Led Zeppelin]] approach and never play again, because the guy was that important? That's the approach we've taken for a lot of years. Or, do you give it a shot, try something? We're willing to take a chance on it. It's completely a reunion because the three of us who're left are back together. But it's not about separating and forgetting — it's about remembering and moving on."<ref name="MTV reunion article">{{cite web| url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1524813/02232006/alice_in_chains.jhtml |title=Remaining Alice in Chains Members Reuniting for Summer Gigs |publisher=[[MTV|MTV.com]] |date=February 23, 2006|access-date=November 24, 2017}}</ref>

About the pressure being put on DuVall for replacing Staley as lead vocalist, Cantrell said, "To put all that weight on Will's shoulders is unfair. We're just figuring out how we work as a team. Although the band has changed, we've lost Layne, we've added Will, and there was no master plan. Playing again in 2005 felt right, so we did the next thing and toured. We did it step by step. It's more than just making music, and it always has been. We've been friends a long time.

==Style==
Cantrell's early influences made Alice in Chains' heavy metal tones stand out among their fellow grunge/alternative rock-oriented bands of the [[Grunge|Seattle music scene]]. However, his musical range also extends into elements of [[blues]] and [[country music|country]] as heard on his solo debut album. Cantrell's guitar playing is known for its unique use of [[wah pedal]] as well as [[odd time signature]]s. In a 1998 interview with ''[[Guitar World]]'', he was asked about the latter quality:

{{quote|I really don't know where that comes from; it just comes naturally to me. I could sit down and figure it out, but what's the use? Off-time stuff is just more exciting – it takes people by surprise when you shift gears like that before they even know what the hell hit 'em. It's also effective when you slow something down and then slam 'em into the dash. A lot of Alice stuff is written that way – "[[Them Bones]]" is a great off-time song.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/archive-jerry-cantrell-his-first-solo-album-and-state-alice-chains|magazine=[[Guitar World]]|title=Jerry Cantrell on His First Solo Album and the State of Alice In Chains|access-date=March 23, 2015}}</ref>}}

Cantrell has been most famously seen playing a [[G&L Musical Instruments|G&L Guitars']] Rampage model. The two models most closely identified with Cantrell are instruments manufactured in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jerry Cantrell's Guitars and Gear|url=https://www.groundguitar.com/jerry-cantrell-gear/|website=GroundGuitar|access-date=July 31, 2017}}</ref> They feature a maple body, maple neck and ebony fingerboard. The bridge is a [[Kahler Tremolo System|Kahler Tremolo]] as opposed to a [[Floyd Rose]] tremolo which was commonly seen on instruments made throughout the 1980s and 90s.<ref>{{cite web|title=G&L Guitars Exclusive Interview with Jerry Cantrell|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6T9tY1ioKQ|work=YouTube|date=April 22, 2013}}</ref> The guitars feature a single-bridge humbucker wired to a volume control.

G&L Guitars makes two Jerry Cantrell Signature guitars available to the general public for purchase.

Cantrell went to the [[Emergency department|emergency room]] but they could not do anything for him there, since the bone had slipped back in his hand and he would need a reconstructive surgery, but he had to wait for a couple of weeks for that to happen. Cantrell wanted to continue the tour, and although he was in a lot of pain, he played his first concert as a [[Lead vocalist|frontman]] without a guitar opening for [[Cheap Trick]] in Atlanta.<ref name="broken hand"/> Cantrell needed a titanium plate and four screws to put the bones back together.<ref name="broken hand"/> Cantrell reported that breaking his hand was the worst physical pain he ever had.<ref name="broken hand"/> The injury caused the remainder of Cantrell's solo tour to be postponed.

Cantrell said in his acceptance speech, "I crash landed here almost 9 years ago, in Los Angeles. Sean [Kinney] was at the door with my brother, so my choices were open the door and go to rehab or jump out the back window down a cliff into some blackberry bushes. That's the choice I took. Luckily they caught me because I couldn't go anywhere, I was kind of stuck in a bush at the bottom of a cliff bleeding, and I ended up here. I didn't intend to get here but I'm very grateful I am here, and it took a lot of people to help me get here. It's been an amazing day. It's overwhelming. I'm as imperfect as they come. I just don't get high today and wake up the next morning and try and do the same thing. A lot of people stand and get the fuck back up after falling. Some people don't get that chance. My band's been a harsh example of that – what happens when you don't deal with it." Cantrell and his Alice in Chains bandmates played a five-song set at the awards event and Cantrell stated, "We really miss Layne [Staley] and Mike [Starr], and we carry them with us in our hearts".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/alice-in-chains-jerry-cantrell-honored-with-stevie-ray-vaughan-award-20120601 |title=Alice in Chains' Jerry Cantrell Honored with Stevie Ray Vaughan Award |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=1 June 2012 |access-date=19 June 2017}}</ref><ref name="speech Musicares"/>
