== Kroh History ==
{{Further|Kingdom of Reman}}
History of Kroh began as the administrative center of [[Kingdom of Reman]] (part of the [[Pattani Kingdom|State of Patani]]), which is located at the eastern boundary of [[Kedah]]. However, King of Reman invaded Klian Intan and undertook mining in the area, until the onset of a series of disputes with the Perak Government which initiated a number of agreements between the British, Siamese and [[Perak]]. In 1902, [[Thailand|Siamese]] government moved in to abolish the monarchy of the State of Reman.
After the [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909]], the Siamese transferred the northern part of [[Hulu Perak]] district to the [[Federated Malay States]], of which Perak is part of. [[Hulu Perak]] district delivery ceremony was held at Kroh on 16 July 1909.

Kroh now known as [[Pengkalan Hulu]]. History of Kroh's name starts with a small river that flows through this area. This river comes from a village called Selarong. Selarong means 'elephant trail' in Arabic. The river and covered with mud baths, the elephant belonging to King Reman, the number reach hundreds. To facilitate the elephant bath, King Reman was ordered that dams built to contain water. The river flows became a small lake with the water that is murky. Due to this city that was named Kroh in the past.

On 4 January 1984, during the reign of the Sultan of Perak 33 of the late Sultan Idris Al-Mutawakkil Alallahi Shah (Sultan Idris Shah II), he has consented to amend the name of the Kroh to [[Pengkalan Hulu]], because this place is a transit point when he went to [[Hulu Perak]] district .

Today, the remains of a small lake has been developed by the district administration as a recreational park named Taman Tasek Takong. The relationship between elephant with Kroh's name has also been immortalised by the District Council logo Pengkalan Hulu, Perak Darul Ridzuan.
