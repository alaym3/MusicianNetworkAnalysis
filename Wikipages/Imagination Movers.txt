The '''Imagination Movers''' are an American [[children's music|children's band]] formed in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], in 2003.<ref name="Imagination Movers">{{Cite web| url = http://www.imaginationmovers.com/about/| title = Imagination Movers| website = Imagination Movers| access-date = 2016-02-29}}</ref> The line-up includes drummer Rich Collins, keyboardist and mandolin Scott Durbin, bassist Dave Poche, and guitarist Scott "Smitty" Smith. Members of the group were longtime friends and neighbors. It all started out with the four members seeing a need to encourage creativity in children, provide positive male role models, and create music and content that "spoke to them, not down to them".<ref name="Imagination Movers"/> Scott Durbin as the progenitor, worked in combination with his other Movers to create a live-action TV show that was a cross between ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'' and ''[[Captain Kangaroo]]'', the foursome worked every night after bedtime, from 9 PM to midnight, to write songs and develop TV show plot lines.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.kcparent.com/February-2011/The-Imagination-Movers-in-Kansas-City-2011/| title = The Imagination Movers in Kansas City: 2011| website = www.kcparent.com| access-date = 2016-02-29}}</ref>

==Career==
Created by four friends in New Orleans, the Imagination Movers began as a television/music concept that was pitched to local PBS affiliates.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/06/arts/television/06disn.html |title=The Imagination Movers Unleash Their Inner Children on the Disney Channel |first=Elizabeth|last=Jensen |date=September 5, 2008|access-date=May 16, 2017 |work=New York Times }}</ref> [[WLAE-TV]] was the first to take an interest in the group and later introduced them to Beth Courtney, the President & Chief Executive Officer at Louisiana Public Broadcasting. Soon after, LPB began airing one-minute videos produced by the Imagination Movers themselves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lpb.org/imaginationmovers/ |title=The Imagination Movers are on LPB!  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201130321/http://www.lpb.org/imaginationmovers/ |archive-date=February 1, 2009 }}</ref>

The Movers built a sizable regional following by setting educational songs for kids to melodies and rhythms that adults appreciate as well. They sold more than 100,000 copies of their self-produced CDs and DVDs. Their three indie CDs: "Good Ideas," "Calling All Movers," and "Eight Feet" along with their grass roots DVD "Stir It Up" have, combined, won fourteen national awards, from such groups as the National Association of Parenting Publications (NAPPA) and Parents' Choice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parenthood.com/article-topics/nappa_2004_music_for_ages_4_and_up.html |title=NAPPA 2004: Music for ages 4 and Up |publisher=Parenthood.com |access-date=October 6, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parenthood.com/article-topics/article-topics.php?Article_ID=9279 |title=NAPPA 2005: Videos & DVDs for Ages 5 and Up |publisher=Parenthood.com |access-date=October 6, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.charlottereview.com/forums/index.php?topic=466.0;wap2 |title=Welcome charlottereview.com - Hostmonster.com |work=Charlotte Review |access-date=October 6, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303071352/http://www.charlottereview.com/forums/index.php?topic=466.0;wap2 |archive-date=March 3, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In early 2005, Disney took notice and initiated negotiations to add the Movers to the company's roster. These were interrupted in August when the flood protection designed and built by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] to protect New Orleans failed. The resulting floodwater claimed the band's office, as well as the homes and jobs of Collins, Durbin, and Poche – but the deal was signed in the spring of 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nola.com/music/t-p/index.ssf?/base/entertainment-0/1175667450171250.xml&coll=1&thispage=2 |title=New Orleans Music News, Listings and Updates |publisher=NOLA.com |access-date=October 6, 2013}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.imaginationmovers.com/about/ |title=Imagination Movers |website=Imagination Movers |access-date=February 29, 2016}}</ref>

In September 2008, a 22-minute show featuring the group began airing on the [[Disney Channel]]'s preschool programming block known as [[Playhouse Disney]], and eventually airing on Playhouse Disney's replacement, [[Disney Junior]]. The Movers starred and were also co-executive producers of the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://happymomblogger.wordpress.com/2011/10/11/the-imagination-movers-an-exclusive-interview/|title=The Imagination Movers – An exclusive Interview |date=October 11, 2011 |access-date=16 May 2017}}</ref>

The Movers wrote and performed all of the songs heard on their show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ny1.com/content/ny1_living/parenting/94233/disney-s-imagination-movers-perform-at-ny1/Default.aspx|title=Parenting: Where To Go 10/4/13 |publisher=NY1|access-date=October 6, 2013}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Moreover, the Imagination Movers have received critical kudos for their live concert performances.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/news.php?id=34888|title=Jazz Fest &#124; 04.24-04.26 &#124; New Orleans, Louisiana |publisher=Allaboutjazz.com |access-date=November 6, 2013 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120182204/http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/news.php?id=34888|archive-date=January 20, 2011}}</ref>

The tour promoted the Imagination Movers' new album/DVD release, "Rock-O-Matic", which featured all new music from the band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imaginationmovers.com/news/64371 |title=Rock-O-Matic available TODAY!!! |publisher=Imagination Movers |date=February 28, 2012 |access-date=October 6, 2013}}</ref> The album Rock-O-Matic itself is produced independently of Disney and has a notably more mature, contemporary rock-and-roll sound, though still very appropriate for children. Imagination Movers can be seen on the Disney NOW app and is available On Demand.

In the summer of 2013, Imagination Movers released their fourth album on Disney records, entitled  "Back in Blue."

==Members==

===Rich Collins===
[[File:Imagination Movers - Rich.jpg|thumb|left|Rich]]
This multi-instrumentalist works the controls in the recording studio. He is the Imagination Movers' drummer on the TV show but plays guitar, bass, and occasionally drums in concert. His drum sticks double as "Scribble Sticks", which he uses to draw words and pictures on the TV screen.

Originally from Silver Spring, MD, Collins graduated from [[The Catholic University of America]] and relocated to New Orleans in the early 1990s to form a rock band, Dubly.<ref>[http://www.imaginationmovers.com/website/meet_rich_collins.php Rich Collins bio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227041331/http://www.imaginationmovers.com/website/meet_rich_collins.php |date=2009-02-27 }}. imaginationmovers.com.

===Scott Durbin===
[[File:Imagination Movers - Scott.jpg|thumb|right|Scott]]
The initial inspiration for Imagination Movers came in 2003 from Durbin, who wanted to create a live action local kids show that presented strong male [[role model]]s for children. Durbin was inspired by the likes of [[Captain Kangaroo]] and [[Fred Rogers]] as well as the musical stylings of [[The Police]] and [[De La Soul]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2006/10/10/money-interviews-imagination-movers-part-one/ |title=Money Interviews: Imagination Movers, part one |publisher=Getrichslowly.org |date=2006-10-10 |access-date=2013-10-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924043110/http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2006/10/10/money-interviews-imagination-movers-part-one/ |archive-date=2013-09-24 }}</ref>

The son of a second-generation [[Methodist]] minister and chaplain in the US Army, Durbin lived the life of an [[army brat]], residing in various places around the world including Washington, D.C., [[San Antonio]], and [[Thailand]], before his family settled in New Orleans when he was around seven years old. He studied abroad in both high school and college, living in [[Japan]] and [[Denmark]]. He has since moved because of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. He currently lives in Lafayette.

Before the formation of the Movers, Durbin received his undergraduate degree in [[religious studies]] from [[Centenary College of Louisiana]] and his graduate teaching certification from the [[University of New Orleans]]. He taught for a total of ten years, which was one of his inspirations for the Imagination Movers. The first six years were at Norco Elementary 4-6 in the St. Charles Parish Public School system where he was awarded Teacher of the Year from his school. Later, he joined the faculty at [[Isidore Newman School]] in [[Orleans Parish]] and again received recognition, receiving the New Teacher of the Year award his first year there.<ref>[http://www.imaginationmovers.com/website/meet_scott_durbin.php Scott Durbin bio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301050347/http://www.imaginationmovers.com/website/meet_scott_durbin.php |date=2009-03-01 }}. imaginationmovers.com. Retrieved on February 16, 2009.</ref> He is married and has two children.

In the Idea Warehouse, Durbin, who plays the [[mandolin]], [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]], and [[melodica]] on the show, also wears "Wobble Goggles," which allow him to see things from a variety of perspectives.

In 2015, Durbin joined the faculty at the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]] as an instructor and coordinator of the Music Business Program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://music.louisiana.edu/faculty/durbin|title=Scott Durbin|date=7 January 2016|access-date=16 May 2017}}</ref> He is now an Assistant Professor and recently received the Sue and Chuck Lein Endowed Professorship in Music Business, 2021-2024. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-durbin-96207aa4/|date=7 June 2021|access-date=7 June 2021}}</ref>

===Dave Poche===
An architect by trade, Poche was part of the design team for the [[New Orleans Saints]] practice facilities and also designed various New Orleans-based banks, office buildings, and hotels. He most recently worked on several designs that are part of the post-Katrina rebuild efforts.

As 'Imagination Mover Dave,' Poche is the Movers' "jack-of-all-trades," using his red gadget hat as a storage device for a variety of objects, many of which he uses to make his cool gizmos and contraptions. Poche is also responsible for creating the concept of the Warehouse Mouse puppet, a mainstay in the series.

An active father, he has taken time from his busy schedule to serve as a Cub Scout den [[Akela (Scouting)|Akela]] as well as a coach for his children's T-ball, basketball, and soccer teams.

While he has no formal theatrical or musical training, Poche did fiddle with the bass briefly in college and has a colorful performance background that includes a stint as a stand-up comic.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.zooglobble.com/blog/2009/10/29/interview-dave-poche-imagination-movers.html| title = Interview: Dave Poche (Imagination Movers)| website = Zooglobble| access-date = 2016-02-29}}</ref> Like his fellow Movers, he is inspired by 1980s and '90s rock, pop and alternative music and by his front-lines experience dealing with his children's sleepless nights, messy playrooms and other growing pains. Poche plays bass guitar on the Imagination Movers T.V. Show and during live performances

Originally from Baton Rouge, Poche received his degree from [[Louisiana State University]] and moved to his wife's hometown of New Orleans. Despite losing their home to Hurricane Katrina, the couple has returned to the New Orleans area where they currently reside with their children.

===Scott "Smitty" Smith===
Smitty, a captain in the New Orleans firefighter, was part of the Hurricane Katrina search-and-rescue effort. While he was the only Mover not to lose his home to the storm, his firehouse was destroyed.

Guitarist for the Movers, Smith is the adventurous outdoorsman of the group; growing up in Southern Louisiana, he hunted and fished every weekend as a child, and continues to do so in his spare time. He enjoys exploring America's National Parks. Smith brings his outdoor experiences to the group by blowing duck and goose calls on some of the band's songs, including "[[I Heard That]]."

An English Literature graduate of the [[University of New Orleans]], Smith's given Mover prop is his trusty journal, which represents his Indiana Jones-like scholarly personality and is used as a resource when the Movers are trying to solve a problem.

A New Orleans native, Smith resides in New Orleans with his wife, Mary, their daughter, and two dogs.
