==History==

===2014–present: ''UTDinfinity'' and ''CrshrsGotWings''===
Before they met, Callaway was working with Nick Miles, a producer that Miller wasn't working with, but knew because they were in the same studios. One day, Miller heard Callaway's music and told him to go to one of his sessions and they ended up making a song together. Miller was in a "terrible" record deal at the time and was staying at an apartment. He offered Callaway to stay with him for about six months since he had an extra room. During these sixth months, they focused on smoking marijuana and recording music. They also recorded music in 1317, which was the unit number to their friend Trice's apartment. It was also their gathering spot for them to hang out and have "real constructive meetings" with their college friends.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ngn2KP2NKpc|title=Quentin Miller and The Cool is Mac Explain How They Linked and Reveal What 1317 Means|date=2016-01-01|accessdate=2016-07-25|website=[[YouTube]]|author=DJ Small Eyez 2}}</ref>

Callaway came up with the name "WDNG Crshrs" by being interested in the 2005 film ''[[Wedding Crashers]].'' He also came up with the spelling.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXTIJWH-J_I|title=WDNG Crshrs Reveal Origin Of Their Name|author=DJ Small Eyez 2|date=2015-09-03|website=YouTube|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-25}}</ref> On February 14, 2015, WDNG Crshrs released their debut mixtape, ''UTDinfinity''.
