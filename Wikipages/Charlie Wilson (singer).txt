'''Charles Kent Wilson''' (born January 29, 1953),{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} also known as '''Uncle Charlie''', is an American singer, songwriter, record producer and the former lead vocalist of [[the Gap Band]]. As a solo artist Wilson's been nominated for thirteen Grammy awards and eleven NAACP Image Awards (including two wins), received a 2009 Soul Train Icon Award, and was a recipient of a BMI Icon Award in 2005. In 2009 and 2020, he was named ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'' magazine's No. 1 Adult R&B Artist, and his song "[[There Goes My Baby (Charlie Wilson song)|There Goes My Baby]]"<ref name="youtube1">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd0T5BuIl0c |title=Charlie Wilson – There Goes My Baby |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-11-24 |access-date=2012-04-04}}</ref> was named the No. 1 Urban Adult Song for 2009 in ''Billboard'' Magazine.

On June 30, 2013, BET honored Wilson with a Lifetime Achievement Award that was presented to him by [[Justin Timberlake]]. The BET tribute performances included renditions of Wilson's songs performed by [[India Arie]] ("There Goes My Baby"), [[Jamie Foxx]] ("[[Yearning for Your Love]]"), and [[Stevie Wonder]] ("Burn Rubber") but it was not until Wilson himself took to the stage at the request of Timberlake to perform his Grammy-nominated song "You Are" and then transition into a medley of hit songs performing alongside Timberlake and surprise guests [[Snoop Dogg]] and [[Pharrell Williams]] that Wilson stole the show during the youth-oriented program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2013/07/charlie-wilson-bet-awards-pharrell-snoop-dogg-justin-timberlake/ |title=Charlie Wilson Scoops the Youth-Oriented BET Awards |publisher=SPIN |date=2013-07-01 |access-date=2014-08-10}}</ref>

Wilson is the national spokesman of the [[Prostate Cancer Foundation]] where there is a Creativity Award in his name which donates hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to researchers across the country for the development of creative science that conforms to PCF funding principles but is short-term and designed to allow development of otherwise unfunded ideas.

==Early life==
Charlie Wilson was born in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], on January 29, 1953; he was the son of the Reverend Oscar Wilson, a minister in the Church of God in Christ. With his older brother Ronnie and younger brother Robert, Wilson often sang in church before their father's Sunday sermons, accompanied on piano by their mother. He also sang in his junior high school's choir, which was a precursor to his musical career with [[the Gap Band]] and later his solo career. He attended high school at Booker T. Washington.  He attended Langston University and would go on to become drum major in the Langston University Marching Pride.

==Career==

===The Gap Band===
From the start of his career, Charlie and his brothers, Robert and Ronnie, helped define and popularize an upbeat form of funk music that was infectious and lasting with their group [[the Gap Band]]. Magicians Holiday was the debut album by The Gap Band in 1974 on Shelter Records founded by [[Leon Russell]] and Denny Cordell. The band recorded at [[The Church Studio]], a historic recording studio in [[Tulsa]], [[Oklahoma]]. The group's songs such as “Outstanding”, "Party Train", "Yearning for Your Love", "Burn Rubber on Me", “You Dropped a Bomb on Me”, and “Oops Upside You” are among their immense catalog and some of the most sampled songs in music history. After 15 albums the Gap Band announced their retirement in 2010.

According to Wilson's website, rapper [[Snoop Dogg]] (with whom he is good friends) nicknamed him "Uncle Charlie".<ref>{{cite web|title=Uncle CharlieWilson|website=unclecharliewilson.com|url=http://www.unclecharliewilson.com}}</ref><ref>[http://blogs.vocalo.org/agill/2010/04/the-wikipedia-files-with-charlie-wilson-gap-band-not-late-congressman/19847 The Wikipedia Files with Charlie Wilson (Gap Band, not late congressman).] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618042739/http://blogs.vocalo.org/agill/2010/04/the-wikipedia-files-with-charlie-wilson-gap-band-not-late-congressman/19847 |date=June 18, 2010 }} ''Wikipedia Files.'' 6 April 2010.</ref> Snoop and his wife, Shante, renewed their vows in April 2008 at Wilson's 20 acre ranch outside of Los Angeles, CA.  The event inspired the music video to Wilson's hit "There Goes My Baby",<ref name="youtube1"/> which featured Snoop and his wife and was given to them as a gift symbolizing their relationship.

A few years later, Michael Paran persuaded Wilson to embark on a solo career. Paran, who is CEO of P Music Group, was responsible for rebranding the GAP Band in 1997 and repositioning them as one of the top R&B touring groups,{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} has managed Wilson for the past 14 years<ref>{{cite web|website=pmusicgroup.com|title=pmusicgroup|url=http://www.pmusicgroup.com}}</ref>

Paran and Wilson independently released Wilson's first solo album ''Bridging the Gap'', which scored them Wilson's first No. 1 Billboard Urban Adult Contemporary single, “Without You.”.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luW1nyw3k0U |title=Without You – Charlie Wilson |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2012-04-04}}</ref>  In 2004, Paran successfully negotiated a multi-album deal for Wilson with [[Jive Records]].  The first album from that deal, ''Charlie, Last Name Wilson'', debuted in the fall of 2005 featuring production from various hit-making producers including [[R. Kelly]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[will.i.am]], the Underdogs, Kay Gee, and [[the Platinum Brothers]].  The album, which was certified gold by the R.I.A.A., produced the hit single, “Charlie, Last Name Wilson".{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Since then, Wilson has consistently topped the Billboard Urban Adult Contemporary chart with singles from his follow up albums through P Music/Jive Records. His 2009 CD, ''Uncle Charlie'', debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 200 and No. 1 on the Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop chart, and received two 2010 Grammy nominations: Best R&B Album and Best R&B Vocal Performance, Male for "There Goes My Baby".{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

In December 2010, ''Just Charlie'', was released and spawned the hit single “You Are"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOcBMh3p-AM |title=Charlie Wilson – You Are |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-12-09 |access-date=2012-04-04}}</ref> which held the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Urban Adult Contemporary chart for 13 weeks as well as 15 weeks consecutively on the Mediabase chart.  The song earned two 2012 Grammy nominations, Best R&B Performance and Best R&B Song, giving Wilson, his wife Mahin, and their fellow songwriters Dennis Bettis, Carl M. Days, Jr., and Wirlie Morris (who co-produced the track with Wilson) their first nomination as songwriters together.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

In the year of 1986, Wilson contributed vocals to [[Roger & Zapp]]'s hit "[[Computer Love (Zapp song)|Computer Love]]", a song that become a hit despite initial opposition from Wilson's label. There was a discussion between Troutman and Wilson to create a music video for the song. Unfortunately, this did not come to fruition, due to opposition from the label that Wilson was signed to at the time. The fact that both singers were from rival bands played a hand in the opposition as well. However, the two maintained their close friendship, and would perform often the song together on stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ebony.com/entertainment/charlie-wilsons-lifetime-achievement-999/|title=Charlie Wilson's Lifetime Achievement [INTERVIEW]|website=www.ebony.com|author=Michael A. Gonzales|date=June 6, 2013|quote=Nobody could make records that grooved the way George Clinton, Bernie Worrell and Bootsy Collins did. P-Funk were the best. Also, [Roger Troutman’s] Zapp and Gap was real rivals, but Roger and me became very close. He used to bring me out onstage with him to sing ‘Computer Love.’ It made my brother mad, but I did it anyway.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://theurbandaily.com/1231125/charlie-wilson-remembers-rivalry-with-roger-troutman-making-computer-love-video/|title=Charlie Wilson Remembers Rivalry With Roger Troutman, Making "Computer Love"|website=www.theurbandaily.com|author=Jerry L.
