'''Run-DMC''' (also spelled '''Run-D.M.C.''') was an American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] group from [[Hollis, Queens]], [[New York City]], founded in 1983 by [[Joseph Simmons]], [[Darryl McDaniels]], and [[Jason Mizell]]. Run-DMC is regarded as one of the most influential acts in the history of [[hip hop|hip hop culture]] and one of the most famous hip hop acts of the 1980s. Along with [[Beastie Boys]], [[LL Cool J]] and [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]], the group pioneered [[new school hip hop]] music. The group was among the first to highlight the importance of the [[Rapping#Emcees|MC]] and [[Disc jockey|DJ]] relationship.<ref name="stone">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5940042/48_rundmc|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060521064711/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5940042/48_rundmc/|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 21, 2006|title=Music News: Latest and Breaking Music News|publisher=Rolling Stone|access-date=September 29, 2013}}</ref>

With the release ''[[Run-D.M.C. (album)|Run-D.M.C.]]'' (1984), Run-DMC became the first hip hop group to achieve a [[RIAA certification|Gold]] record. ''Run-D.M.C.'' was followed with the certified Platinum record ''[[King of Rock]]'' (1985), making Run-DMC the first hip hop group to achieve this. ''[[Raising Hell (album)|Raising Hell]]'' (1986) became the first multi-platinum hip hop record. Run-DMC's cover of "[[Walk This Way]]", featuring the group [[Aerosmith]], charted higher on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] than [[Aerosmith]]'s original version, peaking at number four.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/run-dmc|title=Run-D.M.C.

==History==
===Early career===
[[File:Uncle Jam's Army - Run D.M.C. and Uncle Jam's Army Jam Festival Poster.jpg|thumb|A poster for a Southern California concert starring the group in 1984]]
The three members of Run-DMC grew up in [[Hollis, Queens]].<ref name="stone"/> As a teenager, Joseph Simmons was recruited into hip hop by his older brother, [[Russell Simmons|Russell]], who was then an up-and-coming hip hop promoter. Simmons appeared onstage as a [[DJ]] for solo rapper [[Kurtis Blow]], who was managed by Russell. Known as "DJ Run, Son of Kurtis Blow", Simmons soon began performing with Kurtis Blow.<ref name="oldschoolhiphop profile">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldschoolhiphop.com/artists/emcees/rundmc.htm|title=Run DMC Biography |website=OldSchoolHipHop.com}}</ref> Previously, McDaniels had been more focused on athletics than music, but soon began to DJ after purchasing a set of [[Phonograph|turntables]]. Simmons convinced McDaniels to start rapping, and though McDaniels would not perform in public, he soon began writing rhymes and was known as "Easy D."

Simmons and McDaniels started hanging around Two-Fifths Park in Hollis in the late-1970s, hoping to rap for the local DJs who performed and competed there, and the most popular one known to frequent the park was Jason Mizell, then known as "Jazzy Jase". Mizell was known for his flashy wardrobe and [[b-boy]] attitude, which led to minor legal troubles as a teen. Thereafter, he decided to pursue music fame and began entertaining in the park soon after. Eventually, Simmons and McDaniels rapped in front of Mizell at the park, and the three became friends. Following Russell's success managing Kurtis Blow, he helped Run record his first single, a song called "Street Kid." The song went unnoticed, but despite the single's failure, Run's enthusiasm for hip hop was growing. Simmons soon wanted to record again—-this time with McDaniels, but Russell refused, citing a dislike for D's rhyming style.<ref name="oldschoolhiphop profile" /> After they graduated from high school and started college in 1982, Simmons and McDaniels finally convinced Russell to let them record as a duo, and they recruited Mizell (who was now known as Jam Master Jay) to be their official DJ. The following year, in 1983, Russell agreed to help them record a new single and land a record deal, but only after he changed McDaniels' stage name to his favourite car company, [[Delorean Motor Company]] 'DMC'{{Citation needed|reason=I see no reference to this online. It is in conflict with the later stated origins of Darryl MCdaniel and Devastating Mic Controller|date=July 2020}} and marketed the group as "Run-D.M.C.", a name which, incidentally, the group hated at first. DMC said later, "We wanted to be the Dynamic Two, the Treacherous Two — when we heard ''that'' shit we was like, 'We're gonna be ruined!' "<ref>Weiner, Jonah. [http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=1274 "Run-DMC Record 'It's Like That/Sucker MCs'"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630001558/http://blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=1274 |date=June 30, 2006 }}, ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'', 15 September 2004.</ref>

The group's name used Joseph Simmons's DJ name, DJ Run. It was combined with several letters from Darryl McDaniel's name. (DMC can also stand for "Devastating Mic Controller.")<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://classichiphopmagazine.com/answers/2018/10/27/what-does-run-dmc-stand-for|title=What Does RUN-D.M.C.

After signing with [[Profile Records]], Run-DMC released their debut single "[[It's like That (Run-D.M.C. song)|It's Like That]]/Sucker MCs", in late-1983.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|pages=1044/5|title-link=Encyclopedia of Popular Music}}</ref> The single was well received, peaking at #15 on the R&B charts.<ref name="RS biography">{{cite magazine| url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/run-d-m-c/biography |title= Biography of Run-DMC |magazine= [[Rolling Stone]].com | access-date= 11 February 2015}}</ref> The trio performed the single on the [[New York Hot Tracks]] video show in 1983. Emboldened by their success, Run-DMC released their eponymous debut album ''[[Run-D.M.C. (album)|Run-D.M.C.]]'' in 1984.<ref name="Larkin"/> Hit singles such as "Jam-Master Jay" and "Hard Times" proved that the group were more than a [[one-hit wonder]], and the landmark single "[[Rock Box]]" was a groundbreaking fusion of raw hip hop and [[hard rock]] that would become a cornerstone of the group's sound and paved the way for the [[rap rock]] subgenre movement of the 1990s.

Run-DMC's swift ascension to the forefront of rap with a new sound and style meant that [[old-school hip hop]] artists were becoming outdated. Along with pushing rap into a new direction musically, Run-DMC changed the entire aesthetic of hip hop music and culture. Old school rappers like [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and [[Melle Mel]] of [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]] tended to dress in the flashy attire that was commonly attributed to glam rock and disco acts of the era: tight leather, chest-baring shirts, gloves and hats with rhinestones and spikes, leather boots, etc. Run-DMC discarded the more [[glam rock|glam]] aspects of early hip hop fashion (which were later readopted in 1990 by more "pop" rappers like [[MC Hammer]] and [[Vanilla Ice]]) and incorporated a more "street" sense of style such as [[Kangol]] hats, leather jackets, and unlaced [[Adidas]] shoes.<ref name="Winning"/> The group's look had been heavily influenced by Mizell's own personal style. When Russell Simmons saw Jay's flashy, yet street b-boy style; he insisted the entire group follow suit.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1458481/20021104/run_dmc.jhtml |title=DMC Speaks On Jam Master Jay's Role In The Run-DMC Legacy |publisher=MTV.com |date=November 4, 2002 |access-date=December 7, 2009}}</ref> Run said later:
{{cquote|There were guys that wore hats like those and sneakers with no shoestrings. It was a very street thing to wear, extremely rough. They couldn't wear shoelaces in jail and we took it as a fashion statement. The reason they couldn't have shoelaces in jail was that they might hang themselves. That's why DMC says 'My Adidas only bring good news and they are not used as felon shoes.'<ref>[http://www.fattrak.com/run-dmc-slammed-the-1980s Run DMC Slammed The 1980s]</ref>}}
That embrace of the look and style of the street would define the next 25 years of hip hop fashion.

===''King of Rock'', ''Raising Hell'' and mainstream success===
[[File:Run DMC (cropped).png|thumb|250px|From left to right: Simmons, Mizell, McDaniels]]
After the success of their first album, Run-DMC looked to branch out on their follow-up. The release of ''[[King of Rock]]'' in 1985 saw the group furthering their rap rock fusion on songs like "Can You Rock It Like This" and [[King of Rock (song)|the title track]]; while "Roots, Rap, Reggae" was one of the first rap/dancehall hybrids. The music video for the single "Rock Box" was the first ever hip hop music video to be broadcast on [[MTV]] and received heavy rotation from the channel. The song was the group's most popular hit at that point and the album was [[platinum certification|certified platinum]]. Run-DMC performed at the legendary [[Live Aid]] benefit shortly after ''Rock Box'' was released.

In late-1985, Run-DMC were featured in the hip hop film ''[[Krush Groove]]'', a fictionalized retelling of [[Russell Simmons]]' rise as a hip hop entrepreneur and his struggles to get his own label, [[Def Jam Recordings]], off the ground.<ref name="Larkin"/> The film featured a young [[Blair Underwood]] as Russell, along with appearances by old-school legend [[Kurtis Blow]], [[The Fat Boys]], teen pop act [[New Edition]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] protegee [[Sheila E.]], and hip hop's first successful [[White American|White]] rap group, the [[Beastie Boys]], who were signed to Simmons' Def Jam label. The film was a hit in cinemas and was further proof of hip hop's continued mainstream visibility.

Returning to the studio in 1986, the group teamed with producer [[Rick Rubin]] for their third album. Rubin had just produced LL Cool J's debut album ''[[Radio (LL Cool J album)|Radio]]''. They later released their third album, titled ''[[Raising Hell (album)|Raising Hell]]'', which became the group's most successful album and one of the best-selling rap albums of all-time.<ref name="Larkin"/> The album was certified double-platinum and peaked at number three on the charts.

[[File:Run–D.M.C. - My Adidas-Peter Piper.jpg|thumb|12" single cover for the group's single "My Adidas"]]
They were almost done with the album, but Rubin thought that it needed an element that would appeal to rock fans as well. This spurred the lead single "[[Walk This Way#Run-DMC/Aerosmith version|Walk This Way]]", a collaboration with the group [[Aerosmith]], who years earlier had done their original version of the classic [[hard rock]] song on their album ''[[Toys in the Attic (album)|Toys in the Attic]]''.  The original intention was to just rap over a sample of the song, but Rubin and Jay insisted on doing a complete [[cover version]]. Members of the group Aerosmith (including [[Steven Tyler]] and [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]]) were called to join Run-DMC in the studio to add their vocals and guitars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://anchor.fm/cover/episodes/Walk-This-Way-ec4c5j|title=Walk This Way by Uncovering the Cover • A podcast on Anchor|website=Anchor|language=en|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> The song and video became one of the biggest hits of the 1980s, reaching #4 on the Hot 100, and cemented Run-DMC's crossover status. It also resurrected Aerosmith's career.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal | title = Hall of Fame: Run-DMC bring rap to the masses | journal = REMIX, Electronic • Urban}}</ref> The single "[[My Adidas]]" led to the group signing a $1,600,000 endorsement deal with athletic apparel brand Adidas.

The success of ''Raising Hell'' is often credited with kick-starting [[golden age hip hop|hip hop's golden age]], when rap music's visibility, variety, and commercial viability exploded onto the national stage and became a global phenomenon.<ref name="Larkin"/> Their success paved the way for acts like LL Cool J and the Beastie Boys. The group toured in the wake of the album's success, but the Raising Hell Tour was marred by violence, particularly fights between rival street gangs in places like [[Los Angeles]]. Though Run-DMC's lyrics had been angry, confrontational and aggressive, they typically denounced crime and ignorance, but the media began to blame the group for the incidents. In the wake of the violence, Run-DMC would call for a day of peace between the gangs in Los Angeles.

In 1987, following on from the Raising Hell Tour, Run-D.M.C embarked on the [[Together Forever Tour]] with the [[Beastie Boys]].

===''Tougher Than Leather'', changing times===
After spending 1987 on tour supporting ''Raising Hell'', Run-DMC released ''[[Tougher Than Leather]]'' in 1988. The album saw the group discarding much of their rap rock leanings for a grittier, more [[sampling (music)|sample]]-heavy sound. Despite not selling as well as its predecessor, the album boasted several strong singles, including: "[[Run's House (song)|Run's House]]", "Beats to the Rhyme", and "Mary Mary." Though at the time considered a disappointing follow-up to the blockbuster ''Raising Hell'', the album has grown in stature. In the 2000 liner notes for the album's re-release, [[Chuck D.]] of [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] would call the album "...a spectacular performance against all odds and expectations."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hiphopinjesmoel.com/forums/1/categories/2/topics/18425 |title=HIPHOPINJESMOEL&nbsp;– "Tougher Than Leather" Liner Notes by Chuck D |publisher=Hiphopinjesmoel.com |access-date=December 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070702081556/http://hiphopinjesmoel.com/forums/1/categories/2/topics/18425 |archive-date=July 2, 2007}}</ref>

Later in 1988, the group made their second film appearance in ''[[Tougher Than Leather (film)|Tougher Than Leather]]'', a would-be crime caper that was directed by [[Rick Rubin]] and featured special guest performances by the [[Beastie Boys]] and [[Slick Rick]]. The film bombed at the [[box office]], but strengthened the indirect relationship between Run-DMC and the Def Jam label. Though the group itself was never signed to the label, they were managed by Russell Simmons, produced by Rick Rubin (who was a co-founder of Def Jam, along with Simmons), and often shared [[concert tour]] spotlight with acts on the label's roster.

[[File:Run–D.M.C. - Faces-Back From Hell (test pressing single) (Side A).jpg|thumb|left|A [[White label|test pressing]] release for the single [[Faces (Run-D.M.C. song)|"Faces"]] from the album ''Back from Hell'']]
Amidst the changing times and sliding sales, Run-DMC released ''[[Back from Hell]]'' in 1990. The album was the worst-reviewed of their career, as the group tried to re-create itself musically with ill-advised forays into [[new jack swing]] (a then-popular style of production that sonically merged hip hop and [[contemporary R&B]]) and sometimes-preachy lyrical content. The two singles released, the anti-drug, anti-crime song "[[Pause (Run-D.M.C. song)|Pause]]" and street narrative "The Ave", had little success, and the group began to look outdated. Reeling from their first taste of failure, personal problems began to surface for the trio. McDaniels, who had been a heavy drinker in recent years, was losing control to [[alcoholism]]. Jay was involved in a life-threatening car accident and survived two gunshot wounds after an incident in 1990. In 1991, Simmons was charged with raping a college student in Ohio, though the charges were later dropped.<ref>Pringle, Gill. [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/reverend-run-pray-this-way-481409.html "Reverend Run: Pray this way"], ''The Independent'', 7 June 2006.</ref>

With so much personal chaos and professional uncertainty, the members turned to faith to try to steady their lives. Both Simmons and McDaniels joined the church, with Run becoming especially devoted following his legal troubles and the toll it took on his finances.<ref>Millner, Denene. [http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2000/10/10/2000-10-10_he_s_rev__run_-_for_his_new_.html "He's Rev. Run&nbsp;— For His New Life Rapper's Delight Now Religion"], ''New York Daily News'', 10 October 2000.</ref>

After a three-year hiatus that seemingly saw rap music move on without them, the rejuvenated Run-DMC returned in 1993 with ''[[Down with the King (album)|Down with the King]]''. Building on the gritty sound of ''Tougher Than Leather'', and adding some subtle religious references, the album featured guest appearances and production by several hip hop notables (including [[Pete Rock & CL Smooth]] and [[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]] of [[A Tribe Called Quest]]). Buoyed by the title track and first single, the album entered the charts at #1 and #7 on the pop charts.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Even though the album went platinum, the song proved to be their last hit. [[Jam Master Jay]] also found success on his own; he had founded his own label [[JMJ Records]], and discovered and produced the group [[Onyx (group)|Onyx]], which had tremendous success in 1993 following the release of their hit single, "Slam." Later that same year, Run became an ordained minister, and in 1995 the iconic group appeared in ''[[The Show (1995 film)|The Show]]'', a Def Jam-produced [[documentary film|documentary]] that featured several of hip hop's biggest acts discussing the lifestyle and sacrifices of the industry.

===Later years, Mizell's murder and break-up===
Over the next few years, the group did very little recording. Mizell produced and mentored up and coming artists, including [[Onyx (group)|Onyx]] and [[50 Cent]], who he eventually signed to the JMJ label. Simmons got divorced, remarried, and began to focus on his spiritual and philanthropic endeavors by becoming a reverend. He also wrote a book alongside his brother Russell.<ref name="Winning"/> McDaniels, also married, made an appearance on the [[Notorious B.I.G.]]'s 1997 double-album ''[[Life After Death]]'', and focused on raising his family.

Though the group continued to tour around the world, over a decade of living a rap superstar lifestyle was beginning to take a toll on McDaniels. He was beginning to tire of Run-DMC, and there was increased friction between him and Simmons, who was eager to return to recording (Simmons had at this time adopted the moniker '''Rev Run''' in light of his religious conversion). While on tour in [[Europe]] in 1997, McDaniels' ongoing battle with substance abuse led to a bout of severe [[clinical depression|depression]], which spurred an addiction to prescription drugs. McDaniels' depression continued for years, so much so that he contemplated suicide.<ref>Wells, Christina. [http://www.me-dmc.com/index.cfm/pk/view/cd/NAA/cdid/4390/pid/302621 "'DMC: My Adoption Journey' Documentary Nominated for Emmy Award"] at his official website, 25 July 2007.</ref>

In 1997, producer and [[remixer]] [[Jason Nevins]] remixed "[[It's Tricky]]" and "[[It's like That (Run-D.M.C. song)|It's Like That]]". Nevins' remix of "It's Like That" hit number 1 in the United Kingdom, Germany, and many other European countries. A video was made for "It's Like That", although no new footage of Run-DMC appeared in it. In 1999, Run-DMC recorded the theme song for [[WWE|WWF]] wrestling stable [[D-Generation X]] entitled "The Kings", which appeared on the ''[[WWF Aggression]]'' album. They also made an appearance in a rare version of the music video "[[Bodyrock (song)|Bodyrock]]" by [[Moby]].

Soon after, the group finally returned to the studio, but in an increasingly tense environment, as Simmons and McDaniels' differences had begun to show. In the wake of the exploding popularity of rap-rock artists like [[Korn]], [[Limp Bizkit]], and [[Kid Rock]], Simmons wanted to return to the aggressive, hard rock-tinged sound that made the group famous. McDaniels – who had become a fan of thoughtful [[singer-songwriters]] like [[John Lennon]], [[Harry Chapin]], and [[Sarah McLachlan]] – wanted to go in a more introspective direction. Appearing on [[VH1]]'s documentary series ''[[Behind the Music]]'' in early 2000, McDaniels confirmed that he was creatively frustrated and highlighted some songs that he was recording on his own. The continued friction led to McDaniels sitting out most of the group's recording sessions in protest.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

[[File:Run–D.M.C. - Crown Royal-Queens Day (single) (Side A).jpg|thumb|A single from Run-DMC's final album ''Crown Royal'']]
Simmons, in defiance, recorded material anyway, inviting several guest stars such as Kid Rock, Jermaine Dupri, Adrian Burley, Tony Fredianelli and Stephan Jenkins of [[Third Eye Blind]], [[Method Man]], and fellow Queens MCs [[Nas]] and [[Prodigy (rapper)|Prodigy]] of [[Mobb Deep]] to contribute to the project. The resulting album, ''[[Crown Royal (album)|Crown Royal]]'', was delayed due to the personal problems, and when it was finally released in 2001, it featured only three appearances by DMC. Despite no major singles, the album initially sold well. However, many critics{{who|date=December 2017}} blasted the lack of DMC's involvement. Some positive reviews were published: ''Entertainment Weekly'' noted that "on this hip hop roast, new schoolers Nas and [[Fat Joe]] pay their respects with sparkling grooves...Run's rhymes are still limber."<ref>Browne, David. [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,280651,00.html "Music Capsule Review: Run-DMC: Crown Royal (Arista)"], ''Entertainment Weekly'', 6 April 2001, p.120.</ref>

After ''Crown Royal'', the group embarked on a worldwide tour with their "Walk This Way" compatriots, [[Aerosmith]]. The tour was a rousing success, celebrating the collaboration between the two acts and acknowledging the innumerable rap and rock acts that had been influenced by their seminal hit 15 years prior.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Even though he had little to do with the album, McDaniels was relishing the stage; he had been suffering from an inoperable vocal disorder that had rendered his once-booming voice a strained mumble. Performing allowed McDaniels to come out of his depression and he appeared revitalized on the tour. There was even talk of Run-DMC finally signing with Def Jam, which by then was no longer held by its original founders.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Simmons, however, had been growing increasingly tired of hip hop. His family was growing, and he was assisting with his brother Russell's [[Phat Farm]] clothing imprint, making Run-DMC less of a priority.

===Post-breakup===
In 2004, Run-DMC was one of the first acts honored on the first annual [[VH1]] [[Hip Hop Honors]], alongside legends like [[2Pac]] and [[The Sugarhill Gang]]. The [[Beastie Boys]] paid tribute. Simmons did not attend the show; he was recording his first solo album, ''[[Distortion (Joseph Simmons album)|Distortion]]''. McDaniels also released a solo album, ''[[Checks Thugs and Rock n Roll]]''. He had recently discovered that he was adopted, which led him to be the center of the VH1 program ''My Adoption Journey'', a documentary chronicling his re-connection with his biological family. McDaniels was also featured in the 2008 [[video game]], ''[[Guitar Hero: Aerosmith]]'', making appearances in the songs "Walk this Way" and "King of Rock". He frequently contributed to VH1 programs such as the ''I Love The...'' series, and he released the song "Rock Show" featuring singer [[Stephan Jenkins]]. Simmons also turned to television, starring in ''[[Run's House]]'', a [[reality show]] that followed his life as a father and husband.

In June 2007, McDaniels appeared with Aerosmith performing "Walk This Way" for their encore at the Hard Rock Calling festival in London. Simmons joined [[Kid Rock]]'s 2008 Rock N Roll Revival Tour, performing "It's Like That", "It's Tricky", "You Be Illin'", "Run's House", "Here We Go", "King of Rock" and "Walk This Way" with Kid Rock. They also [[cover version|cover]]ed "For What It's Worth" at the end of the show. In 2007, Mizell's wife, Terry, Simmons, and McDaniels also launched the [[J.A.M. Awards]] in Jay's memory. Jay's vision for social '''J'''ustice, '''A'''rts and '''M'''usic was promoted by many recording artists, including [[Snoop Dogg]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Raekwon]], [[Jim Jones (rapper)|Jim Jones]], M.O.P., [[Papoose (rapper)|Papoose]], [[Everlast (musician)|Everlast]], [[DJ Muggs]], [[Kid Capri]], [[De La Soul]], [[Mobb Deep]], [[EPMD]], [[Dead Prez]], [[Biz Markie]] and [[Marley Marl]]. In October 2008, Mizell's one-time protege [[50 Cent]] announced plans to produce a documentary about his fallen mentor.<ref>Jason. [http://www.rapbasement.com/50-cent/102808-50-cent-will-executive-produce-a-new-documentary-on-run-dmc-member-jam-master-jay.html "50 Cent Produces Jam Master Jay Documentary"], rapbasement.com, 28 October 2008.</ref> In 2008 Run-DMC was nominated for 2009 induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

On January 14, 2009, it was confirmed that Run-DMC would be one of the five inductees to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite news| title= Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees '09: Metallica, Run-D.M.C., and more| first= Simon | last= Vozick-Levinson |url= http://www.ew.com/article/2009/01/14/rock-hall-2009| work= Entertainment Weekly |date= 14 January 2009| access-date= 11 February 2015}}</ref> On April 3, 2009, Run-DMC became the second rap act to be awarded the honor (after [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]], who were inducted in 2007).<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2008-09-22-rock-hall-nominations_N.htm Rock Hall Nominations], ''[[USA Today]]'', 22 September 2008.</ref> The group reunited at Jay-Z's Made In America Festival in September 2012. Simmons and McDaniels then reunited again for [[Fun Fun Fun Fest]] in [[Austin, Texas]] in November 2012, and again in June 2013 and August 2014 for summer concerts in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/atl/ticketing/concerts.jsp?loc=run_dmc |title=Braves Summer Concert Series - Run DMC &#124; braves.com: Tickets |publisher=Atlanta.braves.mlb.com |date=May 24, 2013 |access-date=September 29, 2013}}</ref>

Following the success of ''[[Notorious (2009 film)|Notorious]]'', it was announced in 2009 that a Run-DMC [[biopic]] was in the works, with the screenplay by ''Notorious'' writer [[Cheo Hodari Coker]]. The film was rumored to depict the life and story of the group beginning from their inception in Hollis, Queens, and leading up to the 2002 murder of [[Jam Master Jay]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/run-dmc-biopic-heading-to-the-big-screen-with-help-of-notorious-writer-20090129 |title=Run-DMC Biopic Heading to the Big Screen With Help of Notorious Writer &#124; Music News |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=January 29, 2009 |access-date=September 29, 2013}}</ref> However, the project has yet to go into production.

==Legacy==
{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2017}}
[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]], editor of [[AllMusic]], has written: "More than any other hip hop group, Run-D.M.C. are responsible for the sound and style of the [hip-hop] music."<ref>Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. [{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p121003/biography|pure_url=yes}} Run-D.M.C. Biography] at Allmusic.com</ref> Musically, they moved hip hop and rap music away from the funk and disco-oriented sound of its beginnings, into an altogether new and unique sonic imprint. Their sound is directly responsible for intentionally transforming rap music from dance-and club-oriented funk grooves like "[[Rapper's Delight]]" and "[[The Breaks (song)|The Breaks]]" to an aggressive, less-danceable approach. Characterized by sparse, hard-hitting beats—as typified on hits like "[[It's like That (Run-D.M.C. song)|It's Like That]]", and "[[Peter Piper (song)|Peter Piper]]"—this would form the foundation of [[hardcore hip hop]] (particularly hardcore [[East Coast hip hop]]). As such, Run-DMC is considered the originators of the style, and hardcore hip hop would dominate the next two decades of rap music, from the bombastic, noisy sound of Public Enemy and stripped minimalism of [[Boogie Down Productions]] to the thump of early [[Wu-Tang Clan]] and [[Nas]]. Their influence was not limited to the East Coast, however. Los Angeles' [[N.W.A]], on their landmark 1988 album ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', showed heavy influences from ''[[Tougher Than Leather]]''-era Run-DMC, and [[Chicano]] rap act [[Cypress Hill]] were definitely influenced by Run-DMC's fusion of rap and rock.

[[Rap rock]] fusion proved to be influential among rock artists, with 1980s bands like [[Faith No More]], and [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] adding elements of rap to [[alternative rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Most notably, the rap rock genre became popular in the late 1990s, with bands like [[Urban Dance Squad]], [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[KoRn]], [[Kid Rock]], [[Limp Bizkit]], and [[Linkin Park]]. Aesthetically, they changed the way rappers presented themselves. Onstage, [[Old-school hip hop|old school]] rappers had previously performed in flashy attire and colorful costumes, typically had a live band and, in the case of acts like [[Whodini]], had background dancers. Run-DMC performed with only Run and DMC out front, and Jam-Master Jay on the turntables behind them, in what is now considered the 'classic' hip hop stage setup: two turntables and microphones. They embraced the look and style of the street by wearing jeans, lace-less [[Adidas]] sneakers, and their trademark black [[fedora]]s. The group shunned both the over-the-top wardrobe of previous rap stars like [[the Furious Five]] and [[Afrika Bambaataa]], ''and'' the silk-shirted, [[jheri curl]]ed, ladies' man look of rappers like [[Kurtis Blow]] and [[Spoonie Gee]]. Followers of their style included LL Cool J and the Beastie Boys; seemingly overnight, rappers were wearing jeans and sneakers instead of rhinestones and leather outfits. From Adidas [[tracksuit]]s and rope chains to baggy jeans and [[The Timberland Company|Timberland]] footwear, hip hop's look remained married to the styles of the street. According to the ''[[Rolling Stone]] Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll'':
{{cquote|Run-D.M.C. took hardcore hip-hop from an underground street sensation to a pop-culture phenomenon. Although earlier artists, such as [[Grandmaster Flash]] and [[The Sugarhill Gang]], made rap's initial strides on the airwaves, it was Run-D.M.C. that introduced hats, gold chains, and untied sneakers to youth culture's most stubborn demographic group: young white male suburban rock fans. In the process, the trio helped change the course of popular music, paving the way for rap's second generation.<ref name="RS biography" />}}

In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked them number 48 in their list of the "[[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 Greatest Artists of All Time]]".<ref name="stone" /> In 2007, Run-DMC was named "The Greatest Hip Hop Group of All Time" by MTV.com and "Greatest Hip Hop Artist of All Time" by [[VH1]].<ref name=":1"/><ref name="mtv.com" /> In 2009, Run-DMC became the second hip hop group to be inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name=":2">{{cite web|title=Run-DMC|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/run-dmc|website=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|access-date=21 January 2018}}</ref> In 2016, Run-DMC received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].<ref name=":3" />

Historically, the group achieved a number of ''notable firsts'' in hip hop music and are credited with being the act most responsible for pushing hip hop into mainstream popular music, initiating its musical and artistic evolution and enabling its growth as a global phenomenon. Run-DMC is the first rap act to have reached a number of major accomplishments:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rundmc.com/index.cfm/pk/content/pid/400092|title=Run-DMC|date=January 29, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129154558/http://www.rundmc.com/index.cfm/pk/content/pid/400092|archive-date=January 29, 2009}}</ref>
