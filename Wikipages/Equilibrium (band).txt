'''Equilibrium''' is a German symphonic [[folk metal]] band. The band's music combines elements of [[folk music]], [[melodic black metal]] and [[symphonic metal]] with various other influences. Their riffs reflect traditional Germanic melodies. Their lyrical themes focus on Germanic tales and [[Germanic paganism|Germanic mythology]]. The songs of the band are almost always in [[German language|German]], although most recently they prioritized the [[English language|English]] in their songs, mostly with their sixth album ''Renegades'' (2019).

==History==
The group toured with [[Commander (band)|Commander]] and [[Sycronomica]] in 2005.<ref>[http://www.musicmight.com/linkto/artist/{E922BFF4-4936-4F81-9A5B-83D36BF]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} at [[MusicMight]]</ref> The following year they signed a contract with the [[Nuclear Blast]] [[record label]] and on 27 June 2008 they released their second album, ''[[Sagas (album)|Sagas]]''.

In February 2010, Equilibrium had to cancel their appearance at the Winterfire Festival in [[Germany]] "due to serious restructuring within the band". It was later revealed that vocalist Helge Stang and drummer Manuel DiCamillo had left the band.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=134958 |title=Equilibrium parts ways with vocalist, drummer |date=11 February 2010 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth]] |access-date=11 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212235742/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=134958 |archive-date=12 February 2010 }}</ref> The following month the band announced that Robse, vocalist in the German [[pagan metal]] band [[Vrankenvorde]], had been chosen as their new vocalist.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=135980 |title=Equilibrium announces new singer |date=2 March 2010 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth]] |access-date=2 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303220921/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=135980 |archive-date=3 March 2010 }}</ref>

In the same year, [[Israelis|Israeli]] drummer Tuval "Hati" Refaeli, who is also the drummer of the [[brutal death metal]] band Viscera Trail has joined the band. The band, full again, released their third album, ''[[Rekreatur]]'', via [[Nuclear Blast]], on 18 June 2010.

On 27 June 2013, the band announced their first EP, titled ''[[Waldschrein]]'', which contains a new single along with its acoustic version, a remake of the song "Der Sturm" and an old, previously unreleased song titled "Zwergenhammer", as well as their own cover of the main theme for the game ''[[Skyrim]]'', composed by [[Jeremy Soule]], titled "Himmelsrand". The EP was released on 16 August 2013.

The song "Waldschrein" is part of the next album of the band, ''Erdentempel'', which was released in June 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Erdentempel announcement|url=https://www.facebook.com/equilibrium/photos/a.424585490411.217562.322137685411/10152279059320412/?type=1&stream_ref=10|work=Equilibrioum's official fanpage|publisher=[[Facebook]]|access-date=30 March 2014|language=de, en|date=28 March 2014}}</ref> However, the album contains a completely re-recorded version of the song. Two days after the announcement of the album, founding members and siblings Andreas Völkl and Sandra Van Eldik decided to leave the band for unspecified reasons.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sandra and Andi's statements|url=https://www.facebook.com/equilibrium/posts/10152283552560412?stream_ref=10|work=Equilibrioum's official fanpage|publisher=[[Facebook]]|access-date=30 March 2014|language=de, en|date=30 March 2014}}</ref>

On 20 May 2014, it was announced that Dom R. Crey (guitarist of [[Wolfchant]] and frontman of [[Nothgard]]) would be joining the band as new guitarist, replacing Andreas Völkl. On 7 June 2014, one day after ''Erdentempel''{{'s}} release, it was announced that [[Jen Majura]] would be joining the band as new bassist, replacing Sandra Van Eldik. With her addition to the band, Equilibrium is complete once again.
