'''Off!''' (stylized as '''OFF!''') is an American [[hardcore punk]] [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]], formed in [[Los Angeles, California]] in late 2009 by [[Circle Jerks]]/[[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] singer [[Keith Morris]], [[Burning Brides]] frontman [[Dimitri Coats]], [[Redd Kross]] bassist [[Steven Shane McDonald]], and [[Rocket From The Crypt]]/[[Hot Snakes]] drummer [[Mario Rubalcaba]]. In 2021, it was announced that the line-up changed, with McDonald and Rubalcaba replaced by Autry Fulbright II and Justin Brown, respectively. The band are known for playing short, intense punk songs, with ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' describing the band as "a vital blast of classic hardcore."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=Paul |title=OFF!: First Four EPs Album Review |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14919-first-four-eps/ |website=Pitchfork |publisher=Pitchfork Media |access-date=7 July 2021}}</ref>

==History==
The idea to form the band came after Coats had worked as producer on a prospective Circle Jerks album which ultimately fell apart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2012/07/keith_morris_off_black_flag_interview.php?page=7|title=Q&A: Keith Morris of Off! On Greg Ginn, The Black Flag Days And SST Records |publisher=[[The Village Voice]]|access-date=November 16, 2013}}</ref> During that time, Coats and Morris had written several songs together which they used to start Off!. The group made its live debut at the 2010 [[SXSW|South By Southwest]] Music Festival in [[Austin]], [[Texas]]. Off!'s first Los Angeles show featured an original [[Installation art|art installation]] by [[Raymond Pettibon]] at a downtown warehouse space.<ref name="Bio">{{cite web |url=http://www.burningbrides.com/home.php |title=Official band site.

The first release by Off! was a 7" vinyl EP called ''1st EP,'' which came out on October 13, 2010. That EP, along with three more EPs, were later released as a four 7" vinyl box set entitled ''[[First Four EPs]]'' on December 14, 2010. The collection contains sixteen songs, and featured artwork by [[Raymond Pettibon]]. The compilation is also regarded as the band's debut album.<ref name="discogs.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/OFF-1st-EP/release/2491443 |title=Off-1st-EP |publisher=discogs.com |access-date=2011-01-15}}</ref><ref name="interpunk.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.interpunk.com/item.cfm?Item=186950 |title=Off! - First Four EPs (Box Set) |publisher=interpunk.com |access-date=2011-01-15}}</ref>

In 2012, Off! released [[Off! (album)|a full-length self-titled album]]. In April 2014, the band released their third album, ''[[Wasted Years (album)|Wasted Years]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/53598-off-announce-new-album-wasted-years/ |title=OFF! Announce New Album, Wasted Years |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] |first=Jenn |last=Pelly |date=January 15, 2014 |access-date=2014-01-16}}</ref> Each of their albums has featured cover art by Pettibon, and each is 16 tracks long.

[[Anthony Kiedis]] of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] has been one of Morris' friends for over 30 years. Morris, at one point in the '80s, filled in for Kiedis at one of the band's shows. At every date on the Red Hot Chili Peppers' ''[[I'm with You World Tour]]'', Kiedis wore an Off! hat to promote the band. He also sported the hat in some of the band's music videos. Off! have also opened a few shows for the band. On their relationship, Morris said: “I’ve known Anthony since the beginning of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Anthony and [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] are my friends, and if I want to go out and play shows with some of my friends, I’m going to. I’ve been playing music for over 33 years, and I have some friends that are in extremely large bands. We could go out night after night and play to people who know who we are, and that’s all fan-fucking-tastic, but part of our job is to take it up a couple of notches. Those people may hate us, but maybe they’ll love us. There’s only one way to find out and that’s to do it.”<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bigdayout.com/2012/off/ |title=Off! &#124; Summer 2013 |publisher=Bigdayout.com |date=2012-08-15 |access-date=2013-05-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130615182836/http://www.bigdayout.com/2012/off/ |archive-date=June 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>
