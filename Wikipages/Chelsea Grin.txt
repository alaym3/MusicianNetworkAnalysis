'''Chelsea Grin''' is an American <!--- Please do not change this without consulting the talk page --->[[deathcore]] band from [[Salt Lake City]], Utah. Formed in 2007, the group have released two EPs and five full-length albums.

Chelsea Grin was originally founded under the name ''Ahaziah''. The lineup for Ahaziah included vocalist Alex Koehler, guitarist Chris Kilbourn, bassist Austin Marticorena and lead guitarist Michael Stafford. Marticorena introduced Andrew Carlston to Chelsea Grin and assisted in rewriting their songs as well as the creation of new material as they changed the name to Chelsea Grin soon after. 
This writing process lead to the tracks on their first release, a [[Chelsea Grin (EP)|self-titled EP]] that was streamed and released online through [[iTunes]],  then released on CD worldwide on July 27, 2008.<ref>[http://www.thrashmag.com/reviews/content.aspx?id=3606 Chelsea Grin - Chelsea Grin Album Review] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717052618/http://www.thrashmag.com/reviews/content.aspx?id=3606 |date=July 17, 2011 }} Thrash Magazine</ref> Early on in the band's career, they released the songs "Crewcabanger" and "Lifeless" as singles, both of which were received well by listening audiences on [[Myspace]].<ref name="thesummitmusichall.com">{{cite web |url=http://thesummitmusichall.com/events/The-Summit-Music-Hall.htm?promotion=7303 |title=Chelsea Grin |publisher=Thesummitmusichall.com |access-date=2013-08-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202173506/http://thesummitmusichall.com/events/The-Summit-Music-Hall.htm?promotion=7303 |archive-date=2014-02-02 }}</ref>

The band later sought to add a third guitarist position which led to the acquisition of Dan Jones and  David Flinn  which followed into the writing of their full-length album ''[[Desolation of Eden]]'' (2010), following up this record was ''[[My Damnation]]'' (2011) before cutting into a 2012 EP titled ''[[Evolve (EP)|Evolve]]''. 

In 2013, Pablo Viveros replaced founding drummer Andrew Carlston and started contributing vocals to their music, allowing lead vocalist Koehler to focus solely on the screamed vocals while Viveros took on the mid to low-ranged growls. Since then, the band released two more full-lengths, ''[[Ashes to Ashes (Chelsea Grin album)|Ashes to Ashes]]'' in 2014 and ''[[Self Inflicted (album)|Self Inflicted]]'' in 2016. As of 2018, the band ended their longtime tenure of featuring three guitarists to now only featuring one. That same year, vocalist Koehler departed from the band and was replaced with [[Lorna Shore]] vocalist Tom Barber. With this new four-piece lineup, Chelsea Grin officially released their fifth album ''[[Eternal Nightmare (Chelsea Grin album)|Eternal Nightmare]]'' on July 13, 2018.

==History==
===Debut EP and deal with Artery Recordings (2008–2009)===
Following the release and success of the self-titled EP in July 2008, the signing to Statik Factory Records, and a few small successful west coast tours,<ref name="thesummitmusichall.com"/> Austin Marticorena (bass) left the band for personal reasons.  The band recruited Jake Harmond to temporarily fill in on bass while the band found a permanent member. Not long after this, the band ousted drummer Andrew Carlston, and Kory Shilling took his place, as well as Davis Pugh taking over the full-time bass player position. In April 2009, original drummer, Carlston returned to the band, replacing Shilling, and guitar player, and original member, Chris Kilbourn left the band to start his own record label, Matchless Records. Shortly thereafter, Jake Harmond once again filled in for the band, this time as substitute rhythm guitar player.

Soon after the band started to write the follow-up to the self-titled EP, they decided to take a new route and switch Davis Pugh from being bassist into being a third guitar player after David Flinn joined the band as bassist. The band then was added to a small, week-long Canadian run in June 2009 with [[The Agonist]], [[A Plea for Purging]], [[Arsonists Get All the Girls]] and Statik Factory labelmates, Attila.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waytooloud.com/2009/05/19/no-care-ever-canada-tour-featuring-arsonists-get-all-the-girls-the-agonist-apfp-chelsea-grin-attila-execute-the-sinner/ |title=No Care Ever Canada Tour Featuring Arsonists Get All the Girls, The Agonist, APFP, Chelsea Grin, Attila, Execute Sinner |publisher=Way Too Loud! |date=May 19, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406173757/http://www.waytooloud.com/2009/05/19/no-care-ever-canada-tour-featuring-arsonists-get-all-the-girls-the-agonist-apfp-chelsea-grin-attila-execute-the-sinner/ |archive-date=April 6, 2016 }}</ref> After the successful tour, fill-in guitar player Jake Harmond decided to become a full-time member, and the band joined into a contract with [[The Artery Foundation|Artery Foundation]] representatives, Mike Milford and Eric Rushing whom then booked studio time for Chelsea Grin to record their debut full-length, ''[[Desolation of Eden]]'' at [[Lambesis Studios]] in San Marcos, California during August 2009. The album was produced by As I Lay Dying vocalist and studio founder, [[Tim Lambesis]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Eric|title=Chelsea Grin - Desolation of Eden |url=http://www.teethofthedivine.com/site/reviews/chelsea-grin-desolation-of-eden/|publisher=Teeth of the Divine|access-date=6 September 2011}}</ref>  One week prior to heading into the studio, guitar player Davis Pugh was kicked out of the band, and was replaced with ex-bandmate of Jake Harmond; Dan Jones, of another local Salt Lake City band, Hermione.

Every song is going to be based on real life: alcoholism, drug abuse, violence and everyday bullshit forced down our throats". Koehler described the album as "relentlessly heavy, with a touch of melody.".<ref>[Alternative Press January]</ref> The album also saw the debut of drummer Pablo Viveros' co-vocals, allowing Koehler to focus on high ranged screams while Viveros took on the mid to low ranged vocals. On May 12, 2014 a lyric video for ''Angels Shall Sin, Demons Shall Pray'' was released. Another single for the album was released June 3, 2014 titled "Playing With Fire".

Chelsea Grin declared that their fifth full-length, ''[[Eternal Nightmare (Chelsea Grin album)|Eternal Nightmare]]'', was officially finished in late March 2018. They stated that the record is "without hesitation our meanest, darkest, heaviest and most evil and honest creation to date."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smashpress.nl/chelsea-grin-geeft-albumupdate/|title=Chelsea Grin geeft albumupdate // Smash Press|date=30 March 2018}}</ref> However, after this announcement, the group announced a month later (on April 27, 2018) that vocalist Alex Koehler is no longer a member of the band due to his struggle with [[alcoholism]] and mental health problems. The aforementioned announcement would imply that the record was recorded and finished with Koehler on vocals due to the order of which they were announced in, however this was later confirmed not to be the case as he was already replaced with the release of a music video for a new song entitled "Dead Rose" revealing Tom Barber of [[Lorna Shore]] as the new singer.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/AKGrin/status/989898688880263168|title=Grudges (NEW MUSIC VIDEO OUT NOW!) on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/breakups/chelsea-grin-part-ways-with-vocalist-guitarist-unveil-new-track-dead-rose|title=CHELSEA GRIN Part Ways With Vocalist& Guitarist, Unveil New Track "Dead Rose"|date=2018-04-27|work=Metal Injection|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en-US}}</ref> The album was released on July 13, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/breakups/chelsea-grin-part-ways-with-vocalist-guitarist-unveil-new-track-dead-rose|title=CHELSEA GRIN Part Ways With Vocalist& Guitarist, Unveil New Track "Dead Rose"|date=27 April 2018|website=Metal Injection}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/chelsea_grin_parts_ways_alex_koehler_announce_eternal_nightmare/|title=Chelsea Grin parts ways with vocalist, unveil new song "Dead Rose"|date=27 April 2018}}</ref>
