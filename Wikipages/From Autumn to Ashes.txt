'''From Autumn to Ashes''' is a [[post-hardcore]] band based on [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The group formed in 2000 under the name ''' Who's to Blame'''. While the band had gone through many line-up changes, the members include [[Francis Mark]] ([[vocalist|lead vocals]], [[drum kit|drums]]), [[Scott Gross]] ([[guitars]]), Benjamin Perri (screamed vocals), Brian Deneeve (guitars, [[backing vocalist|backing vocals]]), Stephen Salvio (guitars), [[Josh Newton]] (bass guitar, backing vocals), Mike Pilato ([[bass guitar]], backing vocals), Rob Lauritsen (guitars), Jonathan Cox (guitars) and Jeff Gretz (drums, backing vocals).

Described as "melody and lushness meets brutality,"<ref>{{cite web| last= Henderson| first= Alex| title= The Fiction We Live| website= [[AllMusic]]| url= {{AllMusic|class=album|id=r656999|pure_url=yes}}| access-date= 2007-12-07}}</ref> the band released their debut full-length album ''[[Too Bad You're Beautiful]]'' in 2001. The album featured former band member Benjamin Perri on harsh vocals, with Mark providing the clean vocals and acted as drummer. The year 2003 saw the release of ''[[The Fiction We Live]]'' and 2005, the release of ''[[Abandon Your Friends]]'', the last From Autumn to Ashes album with Perri and Mark in their respective roles. After Perri's departure shortly after ''Abandon Your Friends'', Mark became lead vocalist and in 2007, the band released ''[[Holding a Wolf by the Ears]]''. On June 9, 2008, the band announced that they had gone on "indefinite hiatus." They insisted that the decision was amicable and the band had simply reached its natural conclusion.<ref name="Bio">{{cite web| title= From Autumn To Ashes To Sea| publisher= strangeglue.com| url= http://strangeglue.com/news/from-autumn-to-ashes-to-sea/2122| access-date= 2008-06-09| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090114201549/http://strangeglue.com/news/from-autumn-to-ashes-to-sea/2122| archive-date= 2009-01-14| url-status= dead}}</ref>

From Autumn to Ashes formed on [[Long Island]] in 2000 with Francis Mark (drums, vocals), Steve Salvio (guitar) and Benjamin Perri (vocals)<ref>{{cite web| title= From Autumn To Ashes| publisher= Vagrant.com| url= http://www.vagrant.com/artist/index/17| access-date= 2007-12-07|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071227195559/http://www.vagrant.com/artist/index/17 |archive-date = December 27, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> — Perri provided [[Screaming (music)|screaming vocals]], while Mark sung [[clean vocals]].<ref name="lambgoat">{{cite interview| subject= Francis Mark| subject2= Brian Deneeve| subject3= Scott Gross| interviewer= Mark Keraly| title= An interview with From Autumn To Ashes| work= lambgoat.com| date= February 2002| url= http://www.lambgoat.com/features/articles/fata.asp| access-date= 2007-12-07}}</ref> Commenting on the name of their band, Scott Gross (guitar) said, "you are absolutely not going to get the right answer on this one because that would pretty much end the band" and that "no one is going to know the reason and we are going to keep it that way."<ref name="Punk"/> The term "Autumn" refers to both the season and a fictional character the band created.<ref>{{cite web| title= From Autumn to Ashes| publisher= TheGauntlet.com| url= http://www.thegauntlet.com/bio/158/From-Autumn-To-Ashes.html| access-date= 2007-12-30}}</ref> Mark and Gross planned to use the character in a book.<ref name="Punk"/><ref name="Sing"/> For the first few months as a touring band, From Autumn to Ashes claimed to have sold half of their equipment, a car, and spent between $3,000 and $4,000 making demos and hand distributing them.<ref name="lambgoat"/>

To find a record label, the band says "we pretty much just sent packages to every record label, a shit load of phone calls harassing people."<ref name="lambgoat"/> In 2001, From Autumn to Ashes performed in Long Island with [[Ferret Music]] bands Skycamefalling and Martyr AD, where the founder of Ferret Music, Carl Severson, attended. The following day, Severson contacted the group and they were soon signed in 2001.<ref name="lambgoat"/> The band's debut full-length album, ''[[Too Bad You're Beautiful]]'', was released on August 14, 2001.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web| last= Henderson| first= Alex| title= From Autumn to Ashes| website= [[AllMusic]]| url= {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p507764|pure_url=yes}}| access-date= 2007-12-07}}</ref> ''Too Bad You're Beautiful'', which was written entirety about a relationship Perri had, sold over 100,000 records in the United States,<ref name="Lawless">{{cite web| last= Lawless| first= Andrew| title= From Autumn to Ashes| publisher= threemonkeysonline.com|date=December 2004| url= http://www.threemonkeysonline.com/article_from_autumn_to_ashes_ben_perri_fiction_we_live_interview.htm| access-date= 2007-12-30}}</ref> and thus, From Autumn to Ashes became the highest selling band on Ferret Records.<ref name="Sing">{{cite web| title= From Autumn to Ashes Biography| publisher= letssingit.com| url= http://artists.letssingit.com/from-autumn-to-ashes-gl21q/biography| access-date= 2007-12-30}}</ref> It had also featured vocals on the song "Short Stories With Tragic Endings" from Melanie Wills of the band [[One True Thing (band)|One True Thing]]. A reviewer on [[Punk News]] stated the album had the ability to "put you to sleep like a baby's lullaby, then smash you awake with the most gut wrenching, floor pounding hardcore this side of the Mississippi freakin' river."<ref>{{cite web|author=Duk|url=http://www.punknews.org/review/943|title=From Autumn to Ashes|publisher=[[Punk News]]|access-date=2007-12-30}}</ref> In 2000, under the music label Tribunal, the band released the ''[[Sin, Sorrow and Sadness]]'' EP on March 5, and later took part in the [[Warped Tour]] during the summer months. In 2002, the band employed a live drummer for a number of songs so that Mark could focus on songs that he did more vocals in.

=== ''The Fiction We Live'' (2003–2004) ===
In 2003, following speculation as to which label From Autumn to Ashes would release their next record,<ref name="Punk">{{cite interview| subject= Francis Mark| subject2= Scott Gross| interviewer= Angie Lalonde | title= Interviews: From Autumn To Ashes| work= Punknews.org| date= 2003-07-05| url= http://www.punknews.org/article/6476| access-date= 2007-12-09}}</ref> the band signed to [[Vagrant Records]] and enlisted [[Garth "GGGarth" Richardson]] as producer.<ref name="Foucart">{{cite interview| subject= Francis Mark| interviewer= Jon Foucart| title= From Autumn To Ashes - 03.30.07| work= [[Absolute Punk]]| date= 2007-03-30| url= http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=225457| access-date= 2007-12-30}}</ref> After performing on the 2003 Warped Tour, they released their second full-length album, ''[[The Fiction We Live]]'' on September 9, 2003, which again featured vocals from Melanie Wills on the song "Autumn's Monologue". The album was described as more melodic in sound than ''Too Bad You're Beautiful'', which had a more "hardcore sound."<ref name="Lawless"/> Perri explained that ''The Fiction We Live'''s songs had more structure than their debut release, and was the result of the band's time together.<ref name="Lawless"/> Aubin Paul of Punk News viewed the release as a growth from ''Too Bad You're Beautiful'', writing that "like their previous [album], [this one] contains its share of [[PSAT/NMSQT|PSAT]] words, and overtly maudlin pseudo-poetry, but it's still a big improvement".<ref>{{cite web| last= Paul| first= Aubin| title= From Autumn to Ashes| publisher= [[Punk News]]| url= http://www.punknews.org/review/2263| access-date= 2007-12-30}}</ref> The move to a larger label and slightly more commercialized sound allowed the band to find more mainstream success,<ref>{{cite web| title= From Autumn to Ashes Abandon Your Friends| publisher= SputnikMusic.com| date= 2005-09-02| url =http://www.sputnikmusic.com/album.php?albumid=3393| access-date= 2007-12-30}}</ref> producing three singles, "The After Dinner Payback", "Lilacs & Lolita" and "Milligram Smile".

=== ''Abandon Your Friends'' (2005–2006) ===
On March 8, 2005, a re-release of ''Too Bad You're Beautiful'' was issued, featuring the songs from the ''Sin, Sorrow, and Sadness'' EP. Under direction of producer Richardson, From Autumn to Ashes' third full length album, ''[[Abandon Your Friends]]'', was released on August 30, 2005. The album stemmed from the idea that "[abandoning your friends is] kind of...what we do. I mean, in the sense of how life goes on when we go away [on tours]."<ref name="Lambgoat2">{{cite interview| subject= Josh Newton| subject2= Francis Mark| interviewer=  Drew Ailes| title= From Autumn To Ashes interview| work= lambgoat.com| date= 2005-06-30| url= http://www.lambgoat.com/features/interviews/from_autumn_to_ashes.aspx| access-date= 2007-12-30}}</ref> ''Abandon Your Friends'' met with speculation about the band's internal conflicts surrounding a potential break up.<ref name="Bio"/><ref name="AMG"/> Perri had not been much involved in the process of creating the album and did not attend practice sessions,<ref name="Bio"/> despite stating in interviews that the album was "a full on collaborative effort" and "We just all had a say in what we were writing."<ref name="Metal">{{cite interview| subject= Benjamin Perri| interviewer= CorrosiveMind| title= Interview with Benjamin of From Autumn To Ashes| work= Metalunderground.com| date= 2005-06-23| url= http://www.metalunderground.com/interviews/details.cfm?newsid=14164| access-date= 2007-12-09}}</ref> It was revealed in 2007, in interviews,<ref name="Foucart"/> and when Mark posted in the band's [[Myspace]] blog that he had [[ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] Perri's lyrics in a matter of days.<ref name="MTV"/> The band had made a further move away from the melodic sound of their past albums,<ref name="Lawless"/> and had been a point where the band shifted more focus to Mark's vocals.<ref>{{cite web| title= From Autumn to Ashes| publisher= [[Punk News]]| url= http://www.punknews.org/review/6820| access-date= 2007-12-30}}</ref> [[CMJ]] reviewer Tracey John explained that the album "continues to unabashedly straddle both ends of the hardcore/emo spectrum", however, the band "doesn't show much of a progression from 2003's ''The Fiction We Live''."<ref>{{cite web| last= John| first= Tracey| title= FROM AUTUMN TO ASHES: Abandon Your Friends| publisher= [[CMJ]]| url= http://prod1.cmj.com/articles/display_article.php?id=3547925| archive-url= https://archive.today/20070624192321/http://prod1.cmj.com/articles/display_article.php?id=3547925| url-status= dead| archive-date= 2007-06-24| access-date= 2008-02-10}}</ref> The album generally garnered reviews in which it was noted that, as a reviewer at Punk News explained that if you're a "fan of From Autumn to Ashes, you'll be disappointed."Others disagreed, like UK magazine Kerrang! who gave the album a 5 out of 5 review and called it a metal masterpiece. This album would also go on to sell over 100,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web| title= From Autumn to Ashes| publisher= [[Punk News]]| url= http://www.punknews.org/review/4454| access-date= 2007-12-30}}</ref> ''Abandon Your Friends'' produced one single, "Where Do You Draw The Line?" with an accompanying music video. Unhappy with intraband politics, guitarist Jonathan Cox quit the band.<ref name="NowOnTour"/>

=== ''Holding a Wolf by the Ears'' (2007) ===
After taking a five-month hiatus at the beginning of 2006, From Autumn to Ashes returned and played the length of the 2006 Vans Warped Tour, adding Rob Lauritsen in place of Cox. In September 2006, the band rented practice space and began writing material for what would become ''[[Holding a Wolf by the Ears]]''. [[Brian McTernan]] was chosen as producer because he had previously worked with Mark and Newton on their side project [[Biology (band)|Biology]]'s album, and the members opted for this release to have a less refined feel than the last albums.<ref name="Foucart"/> As From Autumn to Ashes prepared to begin studio recording for the album, Mark noted that Perri "never came out to any of the practices and he had no involvement. But that was also the way it was when we wrote ''Abandon Your Friends''."<ref name="Bio"/> Perri had then declared that he would no longer be a part of the band.  As Mark explains, "I thought there was a more considerate way he could have gone about leaving the band", but it was ultimately "cool of him to recognize that he just didn't have the passion for the band anymore."<ref name="MTV">{{cite news| last= Harris| first= Chris| title= From Autumn To Ashes Reinvigorated By Frontman's Departure| publisher= MTV.com| date= 2007-01-22| url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1550308/20070119/from_autumn_to_ashes.jhtml| access-date= 2007-12-09}}</ref> Deciding to move on without Perri as a member, Mark then became lead vocalist, providing both clean and screaming vocals in addition to his already recorded drums.  Mark, as the band's lyricist explained that he "work[ed] very hard and writing and revising very personal lyrics" and found that a part of him did not want to hand over the lyrics to another to sing, however, with Perri's departure and when Mark began recording vocal tracks, "It immediately seemed like that’s the way things had been all along". Mark stated the bulk of the album's lyrics had been "just about living" and "the idea that extremes are dangerous."<ref name="Bio"/> Recorded in about a month's time,<ref name="NowOnTour">{{cite interview| subject= Josh Newton| subject2= Brian Deneeve| subject3= Jeff Gretz| interviewer= Caz* Bevan| title= Interview with From Autumn To Ashes | work= nowontour.com| url= http://www.nowontour.com/news/interviews/149-from-autumn-to-ashes| access-date= 2007-12-31}}</ref> ''Holding a Wolf by the Ears'' was named for the quotation by [[Thomas Jefferson]],<ref name="Richards">{{cite interview | subject= Brian Deneeve | interviewer= Pete Richards | title= From Autumn To Ashes: Their (Not Emo) Rock Ain't About Looks | work= [[Chart (magazine)|ChartAttack.com]] | date= 2007-05-29 | url= http://www.chartattack.com/features/1860/from-autumn-to-ashes-their-not-emo-rock-aint-about-looks | access-date= 2009-03-20 | url-status= dead | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110607132240/http://www.chartattack.com/features/1860/from-autumn-to-ashes-their-not-emo-rock-aint-about-looks | archive-date= 2011-06-07 }}</ref> "But as it is, we have the wolf by the ear, and we can neither hold him, nor safely let him go.

In early 2007, the band began auditioning drummers to take Mark's place in the upcoming tours. Initially looking for a temporary member, From Autumn to Ashes would remain a quartet if they did not get along with the drummer. However, Jeff Gretz was officially added to the line-up and in March 2007, two weeks before From Autumn to Ashes began touring.<ref name="NowOnTour"/> The ''These Speakers Don't Always Tell the Truth'' EP was released on March 13, 2007 featuring songs from the forthcoming album and a previously unreleased track. ''Holding a Wolf By the Ears'' was released on April 9, 2007 as the last album for the band's contract to Vagrant Records,<ref name="NowOnTour"/> and according to Mark, is "heavier than anything we've ever done" and the "closest we've come to capturing how I think this band should sound."<ref name="MTV"/> Reviewer Corey Apar of [[Allmusic]] noted that the band "sounds stronger than it has {{sic|in a|while|expected=in a while}}".<ref>{{cite web| last= Apar| first= Corey| title= Holding a Wolf by the Ears| website= [[AllMusic]]| url= {{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1031797|pure_url=yes}}| access-date= 2007-12-07}}</ref> Music videos for "Pioneers" and "Deth Kult Social Club" were filmed, the former based on ''[[The Lottery]]'', a short story by [[Shirley Jackson]], and the latter, a live video shot on Long Island as the end of February 2007.<ref name="Foucart"/> "Pioneers" was released as the first single from the album. In September 2007, Newton left the band and From Autumn to Ashes was joined by original bassist Pilato to take on Newton's place.<ref>{{cite news| title= FROM AUTUMN TO ASHES Rejoined By Original Bassist| work= [[Blabbermouth.net]]| date= 2007-09-06| url= http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=80242| access-date= 2008-01-10| url-status= dead| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070910132109/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=80242| archive-date= 2007-09-10}}</ref>

=== ''Live at Looney Tunes'' and indefinite hiatus (2008–2014) ===
In January 2008, the band performed at the Looney Tunes store in New York. A recording of this show was released on Vagrant records on June 17, 2008. This album was From Autumn to Ashes' final release. A week before the live album came out, the band announced they were going to take an "indefinite hiatus." Lead singer Francis Mark commented on the break:

{{quote|''"At this point I feel that we have accomplished everything we could have hoped for with FATA. It doesn't feel much like a break up. Just feels like the end. It's complete. I would say that we are going on indefinite hiatus because the term breakup suggests a more negative circumstance. There have been no quarrels between band members. It is also not a question of fan support because we are lucky to have some of the most loyal and impassioned friends a band could ask for. Thank you again for the overwhelming support of our last album."''|From Autumn to Ashes|{{cite web

Mark and Lauritsen started the band [[Warship (band)|Warship]], which released one album and announced its break-up on their Myspace page December 30, 2009. Soon after, Mark formed the band [[Tidal Arms]] with friends Tom Tierney and Patrick Southern. Deneeve and [[Emanuel (band)|Emanuel]] singer Matthew Breen came together to create the band Summer Law, which was disbanded after several months so that Deneeve could focus on attending culinary academy in hopes of becoming a Master Pastry Chef. Gretz announced his return to drumming for the band [[Zao (US band)|Zao]], and is a member of [[Emanuel and the Fear]].

In the meanwhile Brian Deneeve joined the UK boyband [[The Wanted]] as one of the guitarists for their backing band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theprp.com/2012/01/12/news/ex-thursday-from-autumn-to-ashes-members-perform-with-uk-boy-band-the-wanted-on-ellen-footage-available/|title=Ex-Thursday & From Autumn To Ashes Members Perform With UK Boy Band The Wanted On "Ellen", Footage Available - Theprp.com|date=12 January 2012|website=theprp.com}}</ref> Later he formed a new band called Get Involved which consists of Tucker Rule (Thursday), Derrick Karg, Todd Weinstock (Glassjaw) and Marcus Russell Price.

=== Reunion (2014–present) ===
The band's Twitter account tweeted for the first time on October 13, 2014. All the tweet contained was a picture of the band's debut album Too Bad You're Beautiful. No information can be found on why they did this or what it means.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=FATAofficialNY|author=Autumn To Ashes|number=521772450452099073|date=13 October 2014|title=http://t.co/tji4qGXQAf}}</ref>

Later on November 4, 2014, they posted a lyric line from the song "Kansas City 90210" which contains ""If I wanted to make a comeback would kids receive me? Unemployment, I've been ruined by young hands clapping." which supports the speculation of the band's possible reunion.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=FATAofficialNY|author=Autumn To Ashes|number=529690671138230272|date=4 November 2014|title="If I wanted to make a comeback would kids receive me?

On November 26, 2014, it was announced the band would be reuniting at [[Amnesia Rockfest]] in June 2015,<ref>[https://archive.today/20140816051525/https://www.facebook.com/amnesiarockfest] </ref> stating that more shows would be announced soon after.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=FATAofficialNY|author=Autumn To Ashes|number=537764117101432833|date=27 November 2014|title=There will be more shows announced!

On July 7, 2015, vocalist Francis Mark was charged in Michigan with maintaining a drug house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/metal-crimes/from-autumn-to-ashes-singer-arrested-on-drug-charges-tour-cancelled|title=FROM AUTUMN TO ASHES Singer Arrested on Drug Charges, Tour Cancelled - Metal Injection|date=7 July 2015|website=metalinjection.net}}</ref> In a public statement, Mark addressed the charge, saying:

{{cquote|I wanted clarify a few things in the press and express my gratitude to the fans who continue to stick by us in these trying times. I turned myself in and was not arrested. The alleged drug house in question was merely a medicinal marijuana facility.

In March 2020, the band confirmed a second string of reunion shows, their first in four years. However, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, both the first show in June and the second show in September were cancelled or rescheduled.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brooklynvegan.com/from-autumn-to-ashes-playing-first-ny-show-in-4-years-before-furnace-fest/|title=From Autumn To Ashes playing first NY show in 4+ years before Furnace Fest|date=3 March 2020|website=Brooklyn Vegan}}</ref> The band did confirm that it would play the rescheduled May 2021 dates of Furnace Fest.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://music.mxdwn.com/2020/06/01/news/return-of-furnace-fest-postponed-to-2021-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic/|title=Return of Furnace Fest Postponed to 2021 Due to Coronavirus Pandemic|date=1 June 2020|website=music.mxdwn}}</ref>

For his stylistic influences for playing drums, Mark references [[Stewart Copeland]] of [[The Police]] who he "always thought ... had a really good style", [[Neil Peart]] of [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[John Bonham]] of [[Led Zeppelin]], and [[Keith Moon]] of [[The Who]].<ref name="Suite">{{cite interview| subject= Francis Mark| interviewer= Chad Bowar| title= Fran Mark (From Autumn To Ashes) Interview| work= Suite101.com| date= 2003-10-03| url=  http://i16.tinypic.com/6u66ib4.jpg| access-date= 2007-12-09}}</ref> Following the release of ''The Fiction We Live'', then screaming vocalist Perri explained that the lyrics he was writing for the forthcoming album (''Abandon Your Friends'') would feature lyrics that were inspired by [[Billy Joel]], stating that they were "billyjoelesque" because "they’re more straightforward, not what I’m thinking, what I’m feeling, instead of poetry and shit".<ref name="Lawless"/> However, it is unclear whether the lyrics were used on the album, as was revealed by Mark in 2007, that Perri had not contributed to ''Abandon Your Friends'' and it was Mark who had ghostwritten the lyrics.<ref name="Foucart"/><ref name="MTV"/>

From Autumn to Ashes also combines genres as Mark has said, The combinations of genres allows them to tour with a variety of bands with different styles. They are able to "go on tour with [[Taking Back Sunday]] one month and go on tour with [[Shadows Fall]] the next month."<ref name="Suite"/>
