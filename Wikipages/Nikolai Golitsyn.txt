[[Prince]] '''Nikolai Dmitriyevich Golitsyn''' ({{lang-ru|Никола́й Дми́триевич Голи́цын}}; 12 April 1850 – 2 July 1925) was a Russian aristocrat, monarchist and the last [[Prime Minister of Russia|prime minister]] of [[Imperial Russia]]. He was in office from 29 December 1916 ([[Old Style|O.S.]]) or 9 January 1917 ([[New Style|N.S.]]) until his government resigned after the outbreak of the [[February Revolution]].<!--, and when the Tsar was forced to [[abdicate]]-->

== Biography ==
Golitsyn was born in Porechye, a village in the [[Moscow Governorate]] near [[Mozhaisk]] into the noble [[Golitsyn family]]. His father was Dmitry Borisovich Golitsyn  (1803-1864) who came from [[Bolshiye Vyazyomy]], the family estate. Nikolai passed his childhood in the [[Dorogobuzhsky District]]. He was a graduate of the [[Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum|Imperial Alexander Lyceum]] in 1871 and entered the Ministry of the Interior and appointed in [[Łomża Governorate]] ([[Congress Poland]]). He became vice-governor of Archangelsk (1879); vice-director of the Economic Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (1884); Governor of the [[guberniya]]s of [[Arkhangelsk Governorate|Arkhangelsk]] (1885), [[Kaluga Governorate|Kaluga]] (1893), and [[Tver Governorate|Tver]] (1897). He was appointed [[Governing Senate|Senator]] in 1903. As a plenipotentiary of the Red Cross in [[Turgay Oblast (Russian Empire)|Turgay]] and [[Uralskaya Oblast]]s and [[Saratov Governorate]] he organized help to the famine-stricken areas (1907-1908). He was member of the [[State Council of Imperial Russia|State Council]] (1912) and chairman of the commission to render assistance to the Russian prisoners of war abroad (1915). He was a deputy chairman of one of [[Alexandra Fedorovna of Hesse|Empress Alexandra's]] [[Charitable organization|charity]] commissions.

=== Prime minister===
On 25 December he was invited by the Empress for an interview, but received by the Tsar.<ref>https://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/Падение_царского_режима._Том_2/Допрос_кн._Н._Д._Голицина_21_апреля_1917</ref> A hesitating prince Golitsyn did not want to succeed prime minister [[Alexander Trepov]], insisted on the resignation of the Minister of Internal Affairs [[Alexander Protopopov]] and  begged [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] to cancel his appointment, citing his lack of preparation for the role of prime minister. The Tsar refused, but [[Pavel Ignatieff]], [[Alexander Alexandrovich Makarov|Alexander Makarov]] and [[Dmitry Shuvayev]] were replaced; Nikolai Dobrovolsky was appointed. The [[Council of Ministers of Russia]] officially met once or twice a week (seven meetings in January, six in February). The main concern of the government was "food and transport." The most important thing, according to Prince Golitsyn, was the convocation of the Duma and the desire to work together with it and somehow make this work possible. The government discussed the timeframe for resuming the Duma sessions: it was originally scheduled to open on 12 January, then - on 31 January, but in the end, it was postponed until 14 February.<ref>[http://российская-история.рф/archive/2020-1 F.A.

Despite being the oldest member of the Council (Golitsyn was 66, while the others 36 to 63 years old), he was not a leader. (His advanced years led him to regularly fall asleep during State Council meetings.) In January 1917 two rival institutions, the Duma and the [[Petrograd Soviet]], competed for power. On 8 February, at the wish of the Tsar, [[Vasili Maklakov]], together with [[Protopopov]] ..., drafted the text of the manifesto on the dissolution of the Duma (cancelled and scheduled to resume on 14 February 1917).<ref>[http://российская-история.рф/archive/2020-1 F.A.

"Министр внутренних дел Н. А. Маклаков: политическая карьера русского Полиньяка"</ref> On 14 February mass demonstrations broke out. On 15 February [[Kerensky]] made a speech in the Duma that almost called for the assassination of the emperor. A week later the demonstrations on [[Nevsky Prospekt]] became more serious. On 25th members of the government gathered at Golitsyn's apartment at Konnogvardeyskiy Bul'var, 13.  [[Mikhail Belyaev|Belyaev]] suggested his colleagues to remove Protopopov from his post, as he saw in him the main cause of unrest.  

On 26 February, the Tsar ordered the army to suppress the rioting by force, but troops began to mutiny, joined the protesters and demanded a new constitutional government. In the evening the meeting of the Duma was prorogued, although Golitsyn and [[Nikolai Pokrovsky|Pokrovsky]] opposed its dissolution.<ref>http://www.hrono.ru/biograf/bio_g/golicyn_nd.php</ref> Golitsyn used a (signed,<ref>Katkov, p. 286</ref> but not yet dated [[ukaze]] which had been given to Trepov) declaring that his Majesty had decided to interrupt the [[Imperial Duma]] until 1 April, leaving it with no legal authority to act. The deputies refused to leave and a private body of Duma members was formed to help restore order. 

=== Downfall and execution ===
"In the evening of 27 February the Council of Ministers held its last meeting in the [[Marinsky Palace]] and formally submitted its resignation to the Tsar. They asked [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia]] to assume the regency temporarily. [[Georgy Lvov]] formed a new government on 2 March. The [[Provisional Committee of the State Duma]] ordered the arrest of all the ex-ministers and senior officials"<ref>[[Orlando Figes]] (2006) [[A People's Tragedy]]: The Russian Revolution: 1891–1924, p. 328-329.</ref> On 4 March Golitsyn was transferred to the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] for interrogation, but on 13 March, he was released. 

On 21 April he was interrogated by Extraordinary Commission of Inquiry of the Provisional Government.<ref>https://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/Падение_царского_режима._Том_2/Допрос_кн._Н._Д._Голицина_21_апреля_1917</ref> After the assumption of power by the [[Bolsheviks]], Golitsyn was allowed leave (?) but decided to stay in Russia, earning his living by repairing shoes in Moscow or Petrograd and guarding vegetable gardens in [[Rybinsk]].<ref>[http://российская-история.рф/archive/2020-1 F.A. Gaida (2020) The "Cabinet" of Prince N.D. Golitsyn and the search for a political course in the winter of 1916-1917.]</ref> During the period from 1920 to 1924 he was twice arrested by the [[State Political Directorate|OGPU]], on the suspicion of connection with counterrevolutionaries. After his third arrest (on 12 February 1925), he was executed on 2 July 1925 in [[Leningrad]] on the charge of participating in a "counter-revolutionary monarchist organization".<ref>On the night of 15 February 1925 over 150 people were arrested, most of them graduates of the [[Imperial Alexander Lyceum]], but also to graduates of the [[Imperial School of Jurisprudence]].</ref>
