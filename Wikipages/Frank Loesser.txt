'''Frank Henry Loesser''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɛ|s|ər}}; June 29, 1910 – July 28, 1969) was an American songwriter who wrote the music and lyrics for the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musicals ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]'', ''[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (musical)|How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]]'', and others. He won separate [[Tony Award]]s for the music and lyrics in both shows as well as shared the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] for the latter. He also wrote songs for over 60 Hollywood films and for [[Tin Pan Alley]], many of which have become standards, and was nominated for five [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Academy Awards for best song]], winning once for "[[Baby, It's Cold Outside]]".

== Early years ==
Loesser was born to a Jewish family<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bloom|first=Nate|title=All those Holiday/Christmas Songs: So Many Jewish Songwriters!|publisher=[[Jewish World Review]]|date=December 22, 2014|url=http://jewishworldreview.com/1214/jewz_xmas.php3}}</ref> in New York City to Henry Loesser, a [[pianist]],<ref name=pbs>[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/broadway/stars/loesser_f.html Frank Loesser biography], pbs.org, accessed December 5, 2008</ref> and Julia Ehrlich.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title = A Most Remarkable Fella: Frank Loesser and the Guys and Dolls in His Life|last = Loesser|first = Susan|publisher = Donald I Fine, Inc.|year = 1993|isbn = 1-55611-364-1|location = New York|pages = 1}}</ref><ref name="Cogdill 2010 1">{{harvnb|Cogdill|2010|p=1}}</ref> He grew up in a house on West 107th Street in Manhattan.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Loesser|first=Susan|title=A Most Remarkable Fella: Frank Loesser and the Guys and Dolls in his Life|publisher=ISBN|year=1993|location=United States|pages=4–7}}</ref>

His father had moved to America to avoid [[Prussia]]n military service and work in his family's banking business. He married Bertha Ehrlich; their son, [[Arthur Loesser]], was born on August 26, 1894. Bertha’s younger sister Julia arrived in America in 1898, marrying Henry in 1907 after Bertha died in childbirth. Grace, their first child, was born in December of that year. Their son Frank was born on June 29, 1910.<ref name=Lasser >{{Cite book|last=Lasser|first=Michael|title= "Francis Henry Loesser" American Song Lyricists, 1920-1960|publisher=Gale|year=2002|isbn=978-0-7876-6009-3}}</ref>

Loesser's parents, secular German Jews, prized high intellect and culture, and educated him musically in the vein of European composers.<ref name="Cogdill 2010 1"/> But although Henry was a full-time piano teacher, he never taught his son. In a 1914 letter to Arthur, Henry wrote that the four-year-old Frank could play by ear "any tune he's heard and can spend an enormous amount of time at the piano."<ref>Loesser 1993, p. 8-10</ref> (Frank Loesser later collaborated with musical secretaries to ensure that his written scores reflected the music as he conceived it.)<ref>Loesser 1993, p. 154-156</ref>

Loesser disliked his father's refined taste in music and resisted by writing his own music and taking up the harmonica. He was expelled from [[Townsend Harris High School]], and from there went to City College of New York.<ref name="Lasser" /> He was expelled from the CCNY in 1925 after one year for failing every subject except English and gym.<ref name="Cogdill 2010 1" />

After his father died suddenly on July 20, 1926, Loesser was forced to seek work to support his family.<ref name="Maiers 2009 1–3">{{harvnb|Maiers|2009|pp=1–3}}</ref> His jobs included restaurant reviewer, process server, classified ad salesman for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', political cartoonist for ''The Tuckahoe Record'', sketch writer for [[Keith-Albee-Orpheum|Keith Vaudeville Circuit]], knit-goods editor for ''[[Women’s Wear Daily]]'', press representative for a small movie company, and city editor for a short-lived newspaper in New Rochelle, New York, titled ''New Rochelle News''.<ref name="Cogdill 2010 1"/><ref name="Lasser"/>

== Early career as lyricist ==
Loesser's first song credit was "In Love with the Memory of You", with music by [[William Schuman]], published in 1931.<ref name="Maiers 2009 1–3"/> Other early lyrical credits included two hit songs of 1934, "Junk Man" and "I Wish I Were Twins", both with music by [[Joseph Meyer (songwriter)|Joe Meyer]] and the latter with co-lyric credit to [[Eddie DeLange]]. “Junk Man” was first recorded that year by [[Benny Goodman]] with singer [[Mildred Bailey]] on vocals.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Junk Man 1934|isbn=978-0300110517|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/junk-man/oclc/297548294|oclc=297548294|last1=Riis|first1=Thomas Laurence|date=January 2008}}</ref>

In the mid-1930s, he performed at The Back Drop, a night spot on east [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|52nd Street]], along with composer Irving Actman, while by day working on the staff of [[Leo Feist|Leo Feist Inc.]] writing lyrics to Joseph Brandfon's music at $100 per week. After a year, Feist had not published any of them. Loesser fared only slightly better collaborating with the future classical composer Schuman, selling their 1931 song to Feist that would flop. Loesser described his early days of learning the craft as having "a rendezvous with failure." While he dabbled in other trades, he inevitably returned to the music business.<ref name="Cogdill 2010 1" /><ref>Loesser 1993, p. 13-15</ref>

Loesser's work at the Back Drop led to his first Broadway musical, ''The Illustrator’s Show'', a 1936 revue written with Back Drop collaborator Irving Actman, which lasted only four nights. The year before while performing at the Back Drop, Loesser met an aspiring singer, Lynn Garland (born Mary Alice Blankenbaker). He proposed in a September 1936 letter that included funds for a railroad ticket to Los Angeles where Loesser's contract to [[Universal Pictures]] had just ended. The couple married in a judge's office.<ref>Loesser 1993, p. 24-25</ref> Loesser was offered a contract by [[Paramount Pictures]]. His first song credit there was "[[Manakoora|Moon of Manakoora]]", written with [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]] for [[Dorothy Lamour]] in the film ''[[The Hurricane (1937 film)|The Hurricane]]''.<ref name="Cogdill 2010 1" /> He wrote the lyrics for many popular songs during this period, including "[[Two Sleepy People]]" and "[[Heart and Soul (1938 song)|Heart and Soul]]" with [[Hoagy Carmichael]] and "[[I Hear Music]]" with [[Burton Lane]]. He also collaborated with composers [[Arthur Schwartz]] and [[Joseph J. Lilley]].

One of his notable efforts was "[[See What the Boys in the Back Room Will Have]]", with music by [[Friedrich Hollaender]] and sung by [[Marlene Dietrich]] in ''[[Destry Rides Again]].'' In 1941, Loesser wrote "[[I Don't Want to Walk Without You]]" with [[Jule Styne]], included in the 1942 film ''[[Sweater Girl (film)|Sweater Girl]]'' and sung by [[Betty Jane Rhodes]].<ref name="Cogdill 2010 1"/> [[Irving Berlin]] was a huge fan of the song and once played it repeatedly, telling Loesser why he believed it was the greatest song he wished he'd written.<ref name=independent>{{cite news|first=Tom|last=Vallance|title=Betty Jane Rhodes: Actress and singer who charmed the US as a wartime sweetheart |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/betty-jane-rhodes-actress-and-singer-who-charmed-the-us-as-a-wartime-sweetheart-6296408.html |work=[[The Independent]] |date=January 30, 2012 |access-date=January 30, 2012}}</ref>

Members of the [[Western Writers of America]] chose the 1942 song "[[Jingle Jangle Jingle]]", for which Loesser wrote the lyrics, as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.<ref name="Top100">{{Cite web|title=The Top 100 Western Songs |author=Western Writers of America |year=2010 |author-link=Western Writers of America |publisher=American Cowboy |url=http://www.americancowboy.com/culture/top-100-western-songs |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6RjFQXqGy?url=http://www.americancowboy.com/culture/top-100-western-songs |archive-date=August 10, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

He stayed in Hollywood until World War II, when he joined the Army Air Force.<ref name=pbs/>

== World War II era ==
During World War II, he enlisted into the United States Army Air Forces and continued to write lyrics for films and single songs.<ref name=pbs/> Loesser created the popular war song "[[Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition]]" (1942) inspired by words of navy chaplain Howell Forgy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191843730.001.0001/q-oro-ed5-00004516|title=Howell Forgy - Oxford Reference|website=www.oxfordreference.com|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780191843730.001.0001/q-oro-ed5-00004516|doi-broken-date=October 31, 2021|access-date=August 31, 2019}}</ref> Loesser wrote other songs at the request of the armed forces, including "What Do You Do in the Infantry?" and "[[The Ballad of Rodger Young]]" (1943).<ref name=pbs/> He also wrote "They’re Either Too Young or Too Old" for the 1943 film ''[[Thank Your Lucky Stars (film)|Thank Your Lucky Stars]]''.<ref name="Cogdill 2010 1"/>

In 1944, Loesser worked as the lyricist on the little-known musical, ''Hi Yank!'', performed by and for U.S. soldiers abroad, with music by [[Alex North]]. ''Hi Yank!'' was produced by the U.S. Army Office of Special Services as a "blueprint special" to boost the morale of soldiers located where USO shows could not visit. The "blueprint" was a book containing a musical script with instructions for staging the show using materials locally available to deployed soldiers. According  to a document at the U.S. Army Centre for Military History, a touring company formed in Italy was slated to produce the musical.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/pdf/610_blueprint.pdf PBS History Detectives; "Blueprint Special", 2008, show transcript, PDF] pbs.org</ref> ''Hi Yank!'' was generally forgotten until 2008 when the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] ''[[History Detectives]]''  researched the case of a long-saved radio [[transcription disc]].<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/investigations/610_blueprintspecial.html PBS History Detectives; "Blueprint Special" Aired: Season 6, Episode 10; 2008] pbs.org</ref> The disc has two songs and a promotional announcement for the show's [[Fort Dix]] premiere in August 1944, when the disc was broadcast there.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/investigations/610_blueprintspecial.html Click on player at the bottom to listen to the recording of the Hi Yank soldier musical.

==Broadway and later film career==
[[File:Guys and Dolls, Libretto and Vocal book, published 1978.jpg|thumb|right|Guys and Dolls, Libretto and Vocal book, printed by Music Theatre International, 1978]]
In 1948, Broadway producers [[Cy Feuer]] and [[Ernest H. Martin]] asked Loesser to write music and lyrics to [[George Abbott]]'s book for an adaptation of the [[Brandon Thomas]] play ''[[Charley's Aunt]]''. The musical, ''[[Where's Charley?]]'' (1948), starred [[Ray Bolger]] and ran for 792 performances. A [[Where's Charley? (film)|film version]] released in 1952.

Also in 1948, Loesser sold to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] the rights to "[[Baby, It's Cold Outside]]", a song he wrote in 1944 and performed informally at parties with his then wife Lynn. The studio included it in the 1949 movie ''[[Neptune's Daughter (1949 film)|Neptune's Daughter]]'', and the song became a huge hit. While Garland was mad at Loesser for selling what she considered "their song",<ref name="Loesser">{{cite book|last=Loesser|first=Susan|year=1993|title=A Most Remarkable Fella: Frank Loesser and the Guys and Dolls in His Life; A Portrait by His Daughter|pages=8–10|publisher=Hal Leonard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Ajnf0SdatsC |isbn=1-55611-364-1}}</ref> it  won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]].

His next musical, ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]'' (1950), based on the stories of [[Damon Runyon]], was again produced by Feuer and Martin. ''Guys and Dolls'' became a hit and earned Loesser a [[Tony Awards|Tony Award]].<ref name=mti>[http://www.mtishows.com/biography.asp?writerid=3286 Loesser biography], mtishows.com, accessed August 4, 2009</ref> [[Bob Fosse]] called ''Guys and Dolls'' "the greatest American musical of all time."<ref name="Cogdill 2010 1"/> A [[Guys and Dolls (film)|film version]] was released in 1955, starring [[Marlon Brando]], [[Jean Simmons]], [[Frank Sinatra]], and [[Vivian Blaine]].

In 1950, Loesser started Frank Music Corporation. Initially created as a means of controlling and publishing his work, the company eventually supported other writers, including [[Richard Adler]], [[Jerry Ross (composer)|Jerry Ross]], and [[Meredith Willson]].<ref name="Maiers 2009 1–3"/> Loesser also started the theatrical licensing company [[Music Theatre International]] in 1952. Frank Music and MTI were sold to [[Sony Music|CBS Music]] in 1976.<ref>{{Cite news| pages = 4| title = CBS Buys Show Tuner Frank Music| work = Billboard| date = September 11, 1976}}</ref> CBS in turn sold Frank Music to [[Paul McCartney]]'s [[MPL Communications]] holding company in 1979.<ref>{{Cite news| title = Inside Track| work = Billboard| date = February 17, 1979|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LSUEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22frank%20music%22%20mpl&pg=PT125|via=Google Books}}</ref>

In 1952, Loesser wrote the score for the film ''[[Hans Christian Andersen (film)|Hans Christian Andersen]]''. The movie's songs included  "[[Wonderful Copenhagen]]", "Anywhere I Wander", "[[Thumbelina (Frank Loesser song)|Thumbelina]]", and "[[Inchworm (song)|Inchworm]]".<ref name="Maiers 2009 1–3"/>

He wrote the book, music, and lyrics for his next two musicals, ''[[The Most Happy Fella]]'' (1956) and ''[[Greenwillow]]'' (1960). Around the beginning of 1957, Garland and Loesser divorced, and Loesser began a relationship with [[Jo Sullivan]], who had played the character of Rosabella in ''Fella''. He wrote the music and lyrics for ''[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (musical)|How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]]'' (1961), which ran for 1,417 performances, won the 1962 [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]], and received another Tony and a [[Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album]].<ref name=grammy1961>{{cite web|title=Best Original Cast Album |url= https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards/4th-annual-grammy-awards-1961#category-224|work=grammy.com|access-date=April 21, 2020| date= May 29, 1962}}</ref>

''[[Pleasures and Palaces]]'' (1965), the last Loesser musical produced during his lifetime, closed during out-of-town tryouts.

==Later life and death==
At the time of his death, Loesser was composing the book, music and lyrics for ''[[Señor Discretion Himself]]'',  a musical version of a [[Budd Schulberg]] short story. A version was presented in 1985 at the New York Musical Theatre Works. With the support of his widow Jo Loesser, a completed version was presented at the [[Arena Stage]], Washington, D.C. in 2004, reworked by the group [[Culture Clash (performance troupe)|Culture Clash]] and director Charles Randolph-Wright.<ref>Riis, Thomas Laurence. ''Frank Loesser'' (2008), Yale University Press, {{ISBN|0-300-11051-0}}, p,219-223</ref>

When he was asked why he did not write more shows, Loesser responded that "I don’t write slowly. It’s just that I throw out fast." ''The New York Times'' confirmed his hard working habits and wrote that Loesser "was consumed by nervous energy and as a result slept only four hours a night, spending the rest of the time working."<ref name="Cogdill 2010 1"/>

Loesser, a heavy smoker, died on July 28, 1969 of lung cancer at age 59 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan's East Harlem neighborhood.<ref>Krebs, Alvin, "Frank Loesser, Composer, Dead," ''The New York Times'', July 29, 1969, p. 1</ref>
