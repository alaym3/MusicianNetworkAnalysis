'''Heaven 17''' is an English [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[synth-pop]] band that formed in [[Sheffield]] in 1980. The band were a trio for most of their career, composed of [[Martyn Ware]] (keyboards) and [[Ian Craig Marsh]] (keyboards) (both previously of [[the Human League]]), and [[Glenn Gregory]] (vocals). Although most of the band's music was recorded in the 1980s, they have occasionally reformed to record and perform, playing their first ever live concerts in 1997.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> Marsh left the band in 2007 and Ware and Gregory continued to perform as Heaven 17.

==History==
===1980s===
[[Ian Craig Marsh]] and [[Martyn Ware]] were the founding members of pioneering British electro-pop group [[the Human League]]; Glenn Gregory had been their original choice when seeking a lead singer for the band but he was unavailable at the time, so they chose [[Philip Oakey]] instead. When personal and creative tensions within the group reached a breaking point in late 1980, Marsh and Ware left the band, ceding the Human League name to Oakey. They formed the production company [[British Electric Foundation]] (B.E.F.).<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book| first= David| last= Roberts| year= 2006| title= British Hit Singles & Albums| edition= 19th| publisher=Guinness World Records Limited | location= London| isbn= 1-904994-10-5| pages= 248–249}}</ref>

B.E.F.'s first [[Sound recording and reproduction|recordings]] were a [[Compact Cassette|cassette]]-only album called ''Music For Stowaways''<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book| first= John| last= Tobler| year= 1992| title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years| edition= 1st| publisher=Reed International Books Ltd | location= London| page= 352| id= CN 5585}}</ref> and an LP called ''Music For Listening To'', which was re-released on CD in 1997 with two extra tracks. Shortly after, they completed their line-up when they recruited their friend, photographer Glenn Gregory, as vocalist. Taking their new name from a fictional pop band mentioned in [[Anthony Burgess]]'s [[Dystopian fiction|dystopian]] novel, ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (where The Heaven Seventeen are at number 4 in the charts with "Inside"), Heaven 17 was intended to be just one of the musical projects for British Electric Foundation.<ref>David Buckley ''Electric Dreams: the Human League, Heaven 17, and the Sound of the Steel City'', Aurum Press 2012</ref> 

Like The Human League, Heaven 17 used synthesisers and [[drum machine]]s heavily (the [[Linn LM-1]] programmed by Ware). [[Session musician]]s were used for bass guitar and guitar (John Wilson) and [[grand piano]] (Nick Plytas). Whereas the band's former colleagues the Human League had gone on to major chart success in 1981, Heaven 17 struggled to make an impact. Their debut single "[[(We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove Thang]]" attracted some attention and, due to its overtly [[Left-wing politics|left-wing political]] lyrics, was banned by the [[BBC]] due to concerns by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]]'s legal department that it libelled [[Ronald Reagan]], who had recently been elected President of the United States.<ref name="Banned">{{cite book| title=Banned: Censorship of Popular Music in Britain: 1967-1992|first=Martin|last=Cloonan|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=1996|isbn=1-85742-300-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?as_isbn=9781857423006|page=117|quote = Radio 1 remained wary in the political arena and in 1981 its legal department advised Heaven 17 that their hit 'We Don't Need This Fascist Groove Thing' libelled American President Ronald Reagan by calling him a 'fascist'. So the BBC dropped it...}}</ref> Neither this nor any other of the four singles taken from the band's debut album ''[[Penthouse and Pavement]]'' managed to reach the [[Top 40]] in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> The album itself proved to be a success, peaking at Number 14 on the [[UK Albums Chart]], and was later certified [[music recording sales certification|gold]] by the [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]] in 1982.

[[File:Glenn Gregory.jpg|thumb|left|Glenn Gregory on stage in 2021]]Around this time, Ware and Marsh produced two further albums as B.E.F., the first being ''Music of Quality & Distinction Volume One'' featuring Glenn Gregory, [[Tina Turner]], [[Paula Yates]], [[Billy Mackenzie]], [[Hank Marvin]], [[Paul Jones (singer)|Paul Jones]], [[Bernie Nolan]], and [[Gary Glitter]]. The tracks were [[cover version]]s of songs that Ware, Marsh and Gregory had grown up listening to. The album peaked at number 25. The second album was ''Geisha Boys and Temple Girls'' for the [[dance troupe]] [[Hot Gossip]], which used songs formerly recorded by the Human League and Heaven 17, and a track each from [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and [[Talking Heads]]. B.E.F. took over production duties when [[Richard James Burgess]] of the band [[Landscape (band)|Landscape]] was unable to complete the album.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diskpol.com/product_info.php?products_id=30756&language=en|title=Hot Gossip: Geisha Boys and Temple Girls|publisher=Diskpol|access-date=5 November 2015}}</ref>

In October 1982, Heaven 17 released their new single "[[Let Me Go (Heaven 17 song)|Let Me Go]]", which charted just outside the UK Top 40<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> (but reached the Irish Top 30). However, in 1983 the band's fortunes changed. Their next single, "[[Temptation (Heaven 17 song)|Temptation]]" (on which they were augmented by vocalist [[Carol Kenyon]] and a studio orchestra), reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart in spring 1983 and became their biggest hit.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/southyorkshire/content/articles/2005/06/07/glenn_gregory_interview.shtml |title=South Yorkshire&nbsp;– Entertainment&nbsp;– Glenn Gregory interview |publisher=BBC  |access-date=11 May 2011}}</ref> The song was taken from their second album, ''[[The Luxury Gap]]'', which featured further chart hits "[[Come Live with Me (Heaven 17 song)|Come Live with Me]]" (UK #5) and "[[Crushed by the Wheels of Industry]]" (UK #17).<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> The album itself charted at number 4 on the [[UK Albums Chart]], their highest ever position,<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> and was certified platinum by the BPI in 1984.

[[File:Martyn Ware 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Martyn Ware on stage in 2014]]In the United States, their self-titled ''Heaven 17'' album was a re-working of ''Penthouse and Pavement'' with three songs deleted and replaced by "Let Me Go", "Who'll Stop the Rain", and "I'm Your Money" (along with a different mix of "[[The Height of the Fighting (He-La-Hu)|The Height of the Fighting]]"). American [[New wave music|new wave]] audiences were most familiar with "Let Me Go", which received high rotation [[airplay]] on [[alternative rock]] and new wave format radio stations such as Los Angeles, California's [[KROQ-FM]], and [[Long Island]], New York's [[WLIR]], plus frequent MTV exposure.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/martyn_ware_of_heaven_17|title=Martyn Ware of Heaven 17|publisher=Songfacts|access-date=5 November 2015}}</ref>

Towards the end of 1983, the band (under their B.E.F. guise and assisted by Greg Walsh) helped relaunch [[Tina Turner]]'s career, producing, and providing backing vocals on her hit "[[Let's Stay Together (Al Green song)|Let's Stay Together]]", a cover of the [[Al Green]] song. 1984 saw the release of Heaven 17's third studio album, ''[[How Men Are]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/how-men-are-mw0000742447|title=How Men Are|author=Badgley, Aaron|website=AllMusic|access-date=5 November 2015}}</ref> which reached number 12 in the UK Albums Chart and was certified silver by the BPI. The album featured the [[Earth, Wind & Fire]] [[brass section]], and two singles from the album ("[[Sunset Now]]" and "[[This Is Mine]]") both reached the UK Top 40, but would be the band's last singles to do so until various remixes were released in the 1990s.

The band also worked on the [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] single "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]" at the end of 1984,<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years 2">{{cite book| first= John| last= Tobler| year= 1992| title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years| edition= 1st| publisher=Reed International Books Ltd | location= London| page= 399| id= CN 5585}}</ref> with Gregory supplying vocals alongside [[Midge Ure]] and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], after a personal request from Ure that he attend. However, the band did not perform at [[Live Aid]] the following year. Heaven 17's first "live" performance was in 1986 on the UK television programme ''[[The Tube (TV series)|The Tube]]'' (though the band made use of backing tapes during this performance).

After the [[remix album]] ''Endless'' peaked at number 70 in July 1986, the band's fourth studio album ''[[Pleasure One]]'' was released in November 1986 and featured the single "[[Trouble (Heaven 17 song)|Trouble]]" (UK No. 51, Germany #17). The album contained a number of songs that were originally intended for a French film project that never came to be. This was also the first Heaven 17 album to not mention production credits for B.E.F. and the abbreviation would not appear again until the ''[[Bigger Than America]]'' album in 1996. It was followed up in 1988 with the album ''[[Teddy Bear, Duke & Psycho]]'' (featuring the singles "Train of Love in Motion" and "[[The Ballad of Go Go Brown]]"), although these two albums were poorly received and had little commercial success. In September 1988, the band appeared on the bill at the [[Sport Aid]] event in Sheffield.<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years 3">{{cite book| first= John| last= Tobler| year= 1992| title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years| edition= 1st| publisher=Reed International Books Ltd | location= London| page= 448| id= CN 5585}}</ref> Heaven 17 were managed by Keith Bourton<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Keith+Bourton|title=Keith Bourton|publisher=discogs|access-date=5 November 2015}}</ref> for Heavenly Management Ltd. during much of this period.

===1990s===
The early 1990s was a quiet period for the band, though Ware produced a second B.E.F. album in 1991, to follow 1982's original ''Music of Quality & Distinction.'' This album again featured [[Tina Turner]] and [[Billy Mackenzie]], but this time also featured artists such as [[Scritti Politti]]'s [[Green Gartside]], [[Lalah Hathaway]], [[Billy Preston]], and [[Chaka Khan]]. Ware also became a producer for the likes of [[Terence Trent D'Arby]], [[Soft Cell]]'s [[Marc Almond]], and [[Erasure]]. Gregory, meanwhile, went on to form the band [[Honeyroot]]<ref name=bbcsouthyork>{{cite web|title=Glenn Gregory interview|publisher=BBC South Yorkshire|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/southyorkshire/content/articles/2005/06/07/glenn_gregory_interview.shtml|access-date=13 November 2008}}</ref> with Keith Lowndes, then Ugly with John Uriel and Ian Wright . <ref>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127105556/http://www.mtv.com/news/250046/heaven-17s-glenn-gregory/|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/250046/heaven-17s-glenn-gregory|title=Heaven 17's Glenn Gregory|author=Tortorici, Frank|date=15 May 2008|publisher=MTV|archive-date=27 January 2016|access-date=27 January 2016}}</ref>

In late 1992, a [[Brothers in Rhythm]] remix of "Temptation" reached number 4 and was followed by the compilation album ''[[Higher and Higher – The Best of Heaven 17]]'' in 1993. Remixes of "[[(We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove Thang]]" and "Penthouse and Pavement" were also minor hits in 1993. However, the band would not release any new material as Heaven 17 until 1996's ''[[Bigger Than America]]''. The album failed to chart in the UK.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/bigger-than-america-mw0000033328|author=Fucito, Paul|website=AllMusic|title=Bigger than America|access-date=5 November 2015}}</ref>

===2000s===
The year 2005 saw the release of a new studio album, ''[[Before After]]'', which had a much more contemporary dance sound compared to previous albums. A CD composed entirely of [[remix]]es of the song "Hands Up to Heaven" from the album reached number six on the US ''Billboard'' [[Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Club Play]] chart in May 2006. In October of the same year, [[Virgin Records]] issued a [[Greatest hits album|greatest hits]] [[compilation album]] entitled ''Sight and Sound'', which included a previously-unheard version of "Temptation" with spoken vocals by an unknown student from Germany whom the band met in 1982. It had been discovered on 1-inch tape by Gregory's mother and was remastered by Simon Heyworth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.humanleague.dk/biography/heaven17.html|title=Biography: Heaven 17|publisher=Humanleague.dk|access-date=5 November 2015}}</ref> In November 2005, Heaven 17 were filmed for a live DVD playing to a packed house at [[Scala (club)|The Scala]] in London. The DVD contains an in-depth question-and-answer session with both Ware and Gregory, along with fans' reactions to the gig.

[[File:Billie Godfrey Steel City Tour 2008.jpg|thumb|left|Billie Godfrey onstage with Heaven 17]]In 2006, Marsh stopped making live appearances with the band. In an early 2009 interview, Ware stated that Marsh had left the band and was now studying at university.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-black-hit-of-space.dk/excl_interviews_ware.htm |title=The Martyn Ware Interview |publisher=The-black-hit-of-space.dk |date=February 2009 |access-date=18 April 2014}}</ref> Beginning in the mid-1990s, [[Billie Godfrey]] worked with the band as a backing vocalist and appeared with them at concerts. She performed as part of the band on 21 November 2008 for their highest profile TV appearance of recent years on ''Now That's What I Call 1983'' on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV1]].

In December 2008, Heaven 17 [[concert tour|toured]] the UK as part of the Sheffield band-based Steel City Tour alongside the Human League and [[ABC (band)|ABC]]. Coinciding with this was the release of their new album, ''[[Naked as Advertised|Naked as Advertised&nbsp;– Versions 08]]'', issued through the Just Music record label. The album contained re-workings of tracks such as "Temptation" along with versions of Ware songs best known from his time with the Human League, including "[[Being Boiled]]" and "[[Empire State Human]]", as well as a [[cover version|cover]] of [[The Associates (band)|the Associates]]' hit "[[Party Fears Two]]". The band were managed by [[Nick Ashton-Hart]] for much of the early 2000s.

In December 2009, Heaven 17 made appearances at the "Nokia [[Night of the Proms]]" in Germany.<ref>{{cite book |title=Synthiepop – Die gefühlvolle Kälte: Geschichten des Synthiepop|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IE3yERse7MUC&q=Heaven+17++the+%22Nokia+Night+of+the+Proms%22&pg=PA158 |author=Horst, Dirk|date=2011|isbn = 9783842334229|access-date=5 November 2015}}</ref>

===2010s===
On 16 February 2010, Heaven 17 joined [[La Roux]] to record a joint live session for the [[BBC]] which was shown on the [[BBC Red Button]] interactive channel in January 2010. Glenn Gregory joined La Roux on stage at [[Glastonbury Festival]] on 26 June 2010, performing "[[Temptation (Heaven 17 song)|Temptation]]". (La Roux cite Heaven 17 as one of their main influences).<ref>{{cite web|last=Rogers |first=Georgie |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/news/20100127_laroux_heaven17.shtml |title=Roux – Heaven 17 love-in |publisher=BBC  |date=27 January 2010 |access-date=11 May 2011}}</ref> The two acts also appeared live on stage at the [[War Child (charity)|War Child]] [[Brit Awards]] aftershow in February 2010.<ref>{{Cite tweet |author=War Child |author-link=War Child (charity) |user=WarChildUK |number=9207520567 |date=16 February 2010 |title=...and out of nowhere The Human League appear on stage to perform 'Temptation' with La Roux.

In the run up to their 30th anniversary, the band announced several dates in which they would perform their 1981 debut album ''[[Penthouse and Pavement]]'' live in its entirety for the first time. The dates were scheduled over November and December 2010 with the first date held on 10 November 2010 at the well known [[The Leadmill|Leadmill]] live music venue in Sheffield. By chance the Leadmill also celebrated a 30-year anniversary in 2010. By their own admission this Leadmill gig was one of the band's most successful. The band performed a couple of dates of the Penthouse and Pavement tour in March 2010, one of which was in Sheffield and was filmed and shown on [[BBC Two]] on 16 May 2010. An hour-long documentary about the making of the album was shown on BBC Two the following night.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/sheffield/hi/things_to_do/newsid_8183000/8183265.stm |publisher=BBC | title=The Guide: Weekend things to do | date=2 October 2009 | access-date=4 May 2010}}</ref> This film was also screened at a special "Music in Sheffield" evening of films at the [[Showroom]] in Sheffield, at which Martyn Ware attended, on the eve of the announcement of the City of Culture 2013.

The band appeared on ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]'' on 22 October 2010, performing "(We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove Thang" and "Temptation" and appeared in [[Children in Need|BBC Children in Need]] in November 2010. They also made a tongue-in-cheek appearance in TV advertisements for Sheffield-based broadband provider [[Plusnet]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqxH9iXUDf0 |title=A call centre down the road – Plusnet Broadband – Advertisement |publisher=YouTube |date=18 November 2010 |access-date=11 May 2011}}</ref> On 22 November, the band released a 2 disc DVD combining never-seen-before documentary and rehearsal footage with the band's full live concert filmed in Sheffield in March 2010. Also included was a unique collection of all the digital videos used in the live show, set to the accompanying live audio from the performance. Each video was commissioned from a different visual artist and included both established up-and-coming artists from the worlds of digital and graphic design, fine art, and film.

Since 2011 the band's regular keyboard player has been Berenice Scott (the daughter of Robin Scott of the group M and "Pop Muzik" fame).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electricity-club.co.uk/berenice-scott-interview/|title=Berenice Scott Interview|publisher=The Electricity Club|date=31 January 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903062523/http://www.electricity-club.co.uk/berenice-scott-interview/|archive-date=3 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In July 2014, they appeared as special guests of [[John Shuttleworth (character)|John Shuttleworth]] in his [[BBC Radio 4]] programme ''John Shuttleworth's Music Lounge'' and performed some of Shuttleworth's material.

In November 2015, a compilation album called ''80s Recovered'' featured many groups including Heaven 17. They performed a cover of [[Elton John]]'s "[[Rocket Man (song)|Rocket Man]]", with a regular version, and a remix.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://80srecovered.com/TheSongs.php |title=80s Recovered |publisher=80s Recovered |access-date=13 March 2016 |url-status=usurped|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208100447/http://80srecovered.com/TheSongs.php |archive-date=8 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

During October 2016, Heaven 17 undertook a dual headline tour with their British Electronic Foundation (B.E.F.) The dates included venues in Liverpool, Birmingham, Glasgow, Gateshead, Manchester, Bury St Edmunds, Basingstoke and London. B.E.F. enlisted [[Mari Wilson]], [[Glen Matlock]] ([[Sex Pistols]]), and [[Peter Hooton]] (The Farm) to present new arrangements of songs from the B.E.F. back catalogue. The tour was significant in that it was the first time that Heaven 17 had played the [[Sheffield City Hall]]; having not performed there during the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.co.uk/whats-on/sheffield-s-greatest-band-heaven-17-to-celebrate-with-homecoming-gig-on-uk-tour-1-7982056|title=Sheffield's 'greatest band' Heaven 17 to celebrate with homecoming gig on UK tour|website=Thestar.co.uk|access-date=13 October 2018}}</ref>

In January 2017, Ware and Gregory started work on a new album at Ware's London studio "The House of Illustrious". A work-in-progress version of this album has been released by [[Bowers & Wilkins]] under the title "Not For Public Broadcast" ([[Society of Sound]] #105).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bowers-wilkins.co.uk/Society_of_Sound/Society_of_Sound/Music/Heaven17.html|title=Heaven 17|website=Bowers-wilkins.co.uk|access-date=8 July 2018}}</ref>

In late 2018 Heaven 17 gigs in Liverpool, London, Bristol, Glasgow, Manchester and Sheffield celebrated the 35th anniversary of [[The Luxury Gap]] album. The tour support was provided by X-Propaganda featuring [[Claudia Brücken]] and Susanne Freytag from '80s band [[Propaganda (band)|Propaganda]].<ref>[https://www.heaven17.com/posts/x-propaganda-featuring-claudia-brucken-and-suzanne-freytag-confirmed-as-tour-support X-Propaganda featuring Claudia Brucken and Suzanne Freytag confirmed as Tour Support] heaven17.com 14 Maj 2018</ref>
