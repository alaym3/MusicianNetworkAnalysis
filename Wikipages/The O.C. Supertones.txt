'''The Orange County Supertones''' (a.k.a. '''The O.C. Supertones''', or simply '''The Supertones''') were a [[Christian ska]] band from [[Orange County, California]]. The band was signed to [[Tooth & Nail Records]] and its imprint, [[BEC Recordings]], before becoming an independent band. The band temporarily disbanded in 2005, though reunited in 2010 to resume touring and recording before permanently disbanding in 2017. The OC Supertones were one of the first widely successful Christian ska bands.

In late 1998 they embarked on the all-Christian-ska "Skamania 98" tour with [[The Insyderz]] and [[Five Iron Frenzy]].<ref name="CCM_21_8"/>
In 1999 the Supertones played for the papal visit to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] by [[Pope John Paul II]].<ref name="CCM_21_10">{{cite journal |last=Newcomb |first=Brian Quincy |date=April 1999 |title=Pope Visits St. Louis |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |volume=21 |issue=10 |pages=12–13 |issn=1524-7848 }}</ref>

Beginning with a more traditional ska sound, The Supertones moved next to a harder rock sound, which eventually changed again with more of a pop-rock influence. The band explained the musical evolution to ''CCM'': "[[pop culture]] has the [[attention span]] of a [[flea]]... ska's time in the white-hot spotlight has come and gone."<ref name="CCM_23_5_K">{{cite journal |last=Carlozo |first=Lou |date=November 2000 |title=A Year of Kryptonite |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=56–58 |issn=1524-7848 }}</ref> When saxophonist Dave Chevalier joined [[The Dingees]] in 1998, the band made the decision not to replace his position.

They continued to release albums until 2005, when they announced plans to break up. The band released ''[[Unite (The O.C. Supertones)|Unite]]'', a greatest hits compilation, and played their last show at [[Biola University]] in [[La Mirada, California]] on October 7, 2005.  Former members Jason Carson, Darren Mettler and Tony Terusa re-joined the band on stage for three songs. Kevin "Slim" Chen was on hand but did not play with the band. The Supertones played for 2{{frac|1|2}} hours at their final show, playing close to 30 songs.

===Hiatus===
On March 11, 2008 [[BEC Recordings]], Inc. released "[[The Ultimate Collection (The O.C. Supertones album)|The Ultimate Collection]]," a sort of greatest hits album with select songs from each of the band's studio albums, with the exception of "Revenge of the O.C. Supertones," which has no tracks represented.

On February 12, 2008, former Supertones guitarist Ethan Luck became the newest member playing drums for the Christian pop-punk band, [[Relient K]].

Former front man [[Matt Morginsky]] released his debut solo album, "Doctorate in Cold Rockin' It" under the moniker Mojo & the Info via [[iTunes]] and [[MySpace]] on April 20, 2008. He also released a CD entitled "Everything Will Be Made Right" with the band [[October Light]], as Mojo and October Light.

Former guitarist Kevin "Slim" Chen now plays in the rock/pop punk band New Liars Club with former members of Gameface and the rock band Follow Your Failure.

Original drummer Jason Carson is founder and senior pastor of Encounter Church in Orange County, California.

===Reunion and second disbandment===
In 2010, The Supertones announced that most of the original members would be reuniting for a handful of dates that year and then going back into retirement.  The ensuing tour had fifteen shows, including Joshua Fest in [[Quincy, CA]], [[Soulfest]] in [[New Hampshire]] and [[Spirit West Coast]] in [[Del Mar, CA]].<ref name="SupertonesTourDates2010">[https://www.webcitation.org/5tjLu6pJB?url=http://supertones.webs.com/apps/calendar/showAgenda?calID=4219128&showPreviousEvents=1 archive of Supertones Official Web Site] originally Supertones Official Web Site</ref> ''[[Reunite (album)|Reunite]]'', another greatest hits album, was released during this time as well. At the end of 2010, the band announced that they would continue to play ten or so shows a year going forward.
