'''Dead Prez''', often stylized as '''dead prez''', is an American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] duo composed of [[stic.man]] and [[M-1 (rapper)|M-1]], formed in 1996 in [[New York City]]. They are known for their confrontational style, combined with lyrics focused on both militant [[social justice]], self-determination, and [[Pan-Africanism]]. The duo maintains an ethical stance against [[Corporatism|corporate control]] over [[Mass media|the media]], especially hip hop [[record label]]s.

==Career==

=== Background (1990–2000) ===
In 1990, M-1 headed to [[Tallahassee, Florida]] to attend FAMU ([[Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University]]) where he and stic.man met and formed a relationship due to their mutual love of music and similar [[leftist]] political ideology. While there, their views solidified, M-1 becoming particularly interested in the [[Black Panther Party]].

M-1 joined the [[Uhuru Movement|International People's Democratic Uhuru Movement]] in [[Chicago]] for three years, while stic.man remained in Florida. Burned out by the arduous labor of Uhuru, M-1 and stic.man chose to focus on music. [[Brand Nubian]]'s [[Lord Jamar]] discovered them in [[New York City]] and signed them a deal with [[Loud Records]]. Although dead prez was not always Loud's top priority, they built a fan base due to their over-the-top performances (they've been known to ignite [[United States one-dollar bill|dollar bill]]s and toss apples into the audiences, declaring that they must eat healthily).

They had begun contributing songs to film soundtracks and made featurings on high-profile albums. Their first recorded song, "The Game of Life (Score)" appeared on the 1997 soundtrack to the film ''[[Soul in the Hole]]''.  In 1998 their song "D.O.P.E. (Drugs Oppress People Everyday)" was featured in the movie ''[[Slam (1998 film)|Slam]]''.
