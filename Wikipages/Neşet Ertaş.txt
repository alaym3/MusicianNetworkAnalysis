'''Neşet Ertaş''' (1938 &ndash; 25 September 2012) was a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[folk music]] singer, [[lyrics|lyricist]], modern [[ashik]] and virtuoso of the traditional Turkish instrument the [[bağlama]]. His profession in Turkish is known as ''halk ozanı'', which literally means "folk bard". [[Yaşar Kemal]] gave Ertaş his nickname, "Bozkırın Tezenesi" (literally: "Plectrum of the Steppe"), writing it in a book he gave him as a gift.<ref name="h1">{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/21549347.asp |newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] |title=Bir "gönül hizmetçisi, Bozkırın Tezenesi" Neşet Ertaş.. |author=Dağlar, Ali |date=2012-09-25 |language=tr |access-date=2012-09-27 }}</ref>

==Early years and family life==
Neşet Ertaş was born in 1938, in Kırtıllar, a village in [[Kırşehir Province|Kırşehir]]. His father, [[Muharrem Ertaş]], was also a folk poet. His mother, Döne Koç, was Muharrem's second wife, whom he married after his first wife, Hatice, died early. Neşet was the second of four children; he had an older half-brother, Necati, from his father's first marriage and two younger sisters, Ayşe and Nadiye.<ref name="t">{{cite web |url=http://www.turkuler.com/ozan/MUHARREM.asp |publisher=Türkü Sitesi |title=Muharrem Ertaş (Mahalli Sanatçı ve Kaynak Kişi) |language=tr |access-date=2012-09-27 }}</ref>

His mother Döne also died early, and his father married again, to Arzu. From his third marriage four sons, Ekrem, Ali, Muharrem and Cemal, were born.<ref name="t"/>

Neşet married Leyla, a singer from [[Bolu]], in 1960 in [[Ankara]], where the two had met while performing at a night club. She bore him two daughters and a son.<ref name="b">{{cite web |url=http://www.biyografi.net/kisiayrinti.asp?kisiid=342 |publisher=Biyografi |title=Neşet Ertaş |language=tr |access-date=2012-09-27 }}</ref> The couple divorced after ten years of marriage.<ref name="io">{{cite web |url=http://www.insanokur.org/?p=41255 |publisher=İnsan Okur |title=Abdal Geleneğinin Son Temsilcisi-Neşat Ertaş |date=2012-09-26 |language=tr |access-date=2012-09-27 }}</ref>

==Music career==
At the age of five and six, Neşet Ertaş started to play first the violin and then the [[bağlama]], the Turkish national instrument. His father earned his living by playing at wedding ceremonies in Central Anatolian villages, and for eight years Neşet accompanied him. As a result, he was not able to finish primary school.<ref name="b"/>

At the age of fourteen, Neşet Ertaş went to [[Istanbul]], where he played at a night club in [[Beyoğlu]]. After two years, he moved to Ankara to continue his stage career there.<ref name="b"/> He applied to the state-owned [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation|Turkish Radio]] (TRT) station in Ankara and began performing [[türkü]], Turkish folk songs, on a daytime programme called ''Yurttan Sesler'' (literally: "Sounds from the Homeland") under the name "Neşet Ertaş of Kırşehir". At the same time, he played in night clubs at night.<ref name="h1"/><ref name="io"/>

He became very popular and gave concerts in many cities, in some cases six or seven times. His compositions and recordings made him renowned. But then in 1978, his fingers became paralysed. He soon became penniless and had no means of paying for treatment, since he had no other marketable skills. So in 1979 he went to Germany, where his brother was living. There, he recovered from his paralysis, and started again to perform music at wedding ceremonies and local events attended by members of the [[Turks in Germany|Turkish community in Germany]]. He also took his three children there.<ref name="b"/> A German school of arts offered him a teaching post for [[bağlama|saz]] playing. He accepted and served for two years in this position.<ref name="io"/>

During his time in Germany, Ertaş dedicated himself to his children's education, and he was almost forgotten in his country. However, pirates continued to profit from playing his music and lyrics in Turkey. In the beginning of 2000, he protested openly against the TRT, which had stated that he was dead.<ref name="io"/>

After 23 years, he returned home and was welcomed by crowds. The audience at his first concert, which took place at the [[Cemil Topuzlu Open-Air Theatre|Harbiye Open-Air Theatre]] in Istanbul, gave him a [[standing ovation]] to his great surprise, a great success after 30 years of absence. This was followed by tours around the country and free concerts. He experienced again the pleasure of meeting the people of his homeland.<ref name="io"/> However, he rejected the title of "State Artist" which the Turkish state wanted to award him, saying, "I am already an artist of this state."<ref name="h1"/>

Ertaş's first record was released in 1957.<ref name="b"/> During his career, he recorded more than 30 albums. It is claimed that due to flawed [[Copyright law of Turkey|copyright laws in Turkey]], he did not fully benefit from his poems, music and audio recordings.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.radikal.com.tr/Radikal.aspx?aType=RadikalDetayV3&ArticleID=1101860&CategoryID=82 |newspaper=[[Radikal]] |title=Neşet Ertaş devletten alacaklı gitti |date=2012-09-27 |language=tr |access-date=2012-09-27 }}</ref>

He interpreted musical pieces of the [[Abdal]]-Turkoman tradition, following his father. With his forceful baglama, his warm voice and his pure and simple language, Neşet Ertaş gathered the people of Central Anatolia first, and then the entire country.<ref name="h1"/><ref name="io"/>

==Awards==
In 2006, the [[Turkish Grand National Assembly]] rewarded him the [[State Medal of Distinguished Service (Turkey)|State Medal of Distinguished Service]], which he accepted, in his words, "on behalf of [his] ancestry".<ref name="h2">{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/kultur-sanat/haber/17633921.asp |newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] |title=İTÜ’den Neşet Ertaş'a fahri doktora |date=2012-04-25 |language=tr |access-date=2012-09-27 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://sinematelevizyonlifestyle.com/category/editoryal/ |publisher=Sinema Televizyon Lifestyle |title=Ah Yalan Dünya – Medya Kaza Raporu |date=2012-10-01 |language=tr |access-date=2012-11-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111005145/http://sinematelevizyonlifestyle.com/category/editoryal/ |archive-date=2012-11-11 }}</ref>

In 2010, Neşet Ertaş was honoured with the [[UNESCO]] "National [[Living Human Treasure]]" award.<ref name="h2"/>

On April 25, 2011, he was awarded an [[honorary doctorate]] by [[Istanbul Technical University]].<ref name="h2"/>

==Death and burial==
Ertaş died on 25 September 2012 at the age of 74 in a hospital in [[Izmir]] after being taken in two weeks previously for prostate cancer treatment.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/kultur-sanat/haber/21549013.asp|newspaper=[[Hürriyet]]|title=Neşet Ertaş'ı kaybettik |date=25 September 2012|language=tr|access-date=25 September 2012}}</ref> His body was flown to Ankara, from where it was transported to Çiçekdağı in Kırşehir Province. After the religious funeral held in [[Ahi Evran]] Mosque, which was attended by high-ranked politicians such as Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], Minister of Culture [[Ertuğrul Günay]] and opposition leader [[Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu]] and renowned people from the Turkish music scene such as [[Orhan Gencebay]] and [[Arif Sağ]] along with ten thousand others, he was buried at the foot of his father's grave as he had requested in his [[Will (law)|will]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/kultur-sanat/haber/21556530.asp |newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] |title=Neşet Ertaş'a son görev |date=2012-09-27 |language=tr |access-date=2012-09-27 }}</ref>
