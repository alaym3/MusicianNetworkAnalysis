'''Oskar Gabriel Steinbeck''', known by his stage name '''Panda Eyes''' (born May 28, 1996), is a Swiss composer, record producer and DJ from [[Zurich]], Switzerland.<ref name="allmusic.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/panda-eyes-mn0003443354/biography|title=Panda Eyes - Biography & History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}</ref>

==Career==
Steinbeck started in 2013 bringing together elements of [[chiptune]], [[dubstep]] and other genres of bass music to form his own style of glitch-hop.<ref name="allmusic.com"/> Recording multiple singles, he gained recognition by releasing them on [[YouTube]] and [[SoundCloud]].

In early 2015 he released the song "Superheroes" with German producer [[Virtual Riot]]. Later that year, he worked with Brighton-based producer Teminite on their collaboration "Highscore". The song was released in the same year by Panda Eyes and Teminite, and has surpassed 62 million on streams on [[YouTube]] alone. His song "Colorblind" has surpassed 45 million views on [[YouTube]]. Ultimately he released a selection of his best recordings on [[iTunes]] and [[Spotify]] without a label in October 2015.<ref name="ukf.com">{{cite web|url=https://ukf.com/words/rise-panda-eyes/17151|title=The Rise of Panda Eyes|date=17 August 2016|publisher=}}</ref>

In 2016, Steinbeck gave his first interview to [[UKF Music|UKF.com]] naming [[Nero (band)|Nero]], [[Rusko (musician)|Rusko]] and [[Knife Party]] as triggers that switched him to Dubstep and the French-Duo [[Justice (band)|Justice]] as his main inspiration to go for [[electronic music]]. Announcing the release of "Nostalgia 64" he said "...it's the first tune when I’ve had an idea when I'm out with friends having a beer and I’ve actually recorded it down on my phone. It's the first tune I’ve made from a memo. I felt stupid doing it but I thought ‘f**k it’ and sang it in my phone."<ref name="ukf.com" />

In 2017, he released a remix of the 2012 [[Seven Lions]] song "Days To Come" with approval from [[Skrillex]] founded [[OWSLA]] to release the tune for free, saying, "You know when you have these melodies in your head and you know you know it, and you know you once knew what the name of it was but you've forgotten it? Well I had that with this. I woke up from a dream and had it in my head. I was like shit! I know this! What is it? After 10 minutes of intensely interrogating my brain I remembered it was Seven Lions."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ukf.com/words/perfect-remix-panda-eyes/18540|title=The Perfect Remix: Panda Eyes|date=6 February 2017|publisher=}}</ref> In April he posted a video on [[Facebook]], announcing that he was working on a new album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/PandaEyesofficial/videos/1432159106844474/|title=Panda Eyes|website=www.facebook.com}}</ref> Oskar was diagnosed with [[autoimmune disease]] while producing his album ''Continue''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ukf.com/words/panda-eyes-continue/20242|title=How Panda Eyes wrote his album while coming to terms with an incurable disease|date=2017-09-08|work=UKF|access-date=2017-12-29|language=en-US}}</ref>

On May 28, 2018, Steinbeck officially signed to Disciple Records.<ref>{{Citation|last=Disciple|title=PANDA EYES JOINS THE BATTLE!|date=2018-05-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r8oXgJAtUU|access-date=2018-06-17}}</ref> "Disciple was definitely my first choice for a label since they seemed to care a lot about values of being a family and supporting each other and having fun while doing that." he said. "I'm very happy about the situation since a lot of the artists on Disciple are people I look up to and I adore them so it's such a pleasure to work with them." To celebrate his arrival, he also released his EP "Isolation." Steinbeck describes his EP as the story for his trip to [[Los Angeles]]. He wrote the first two songs to be more introspective, which set the overall message for the EP. Steinbeck says he's here and alive, and that he will never stop pursuing his dreams and inspirations. "The second two tracks are more uplifting melodically and particularly the collaboration with [[Virtual Riot]] and Barely Alive felt like the first step in pursuing a new journey and getting out of Isolation in Switzerland."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ukf.com/news/panda-eyes-officially-joins-the-disciple-family-with-vital-new-ep-isolation/22070|title=Panda Eyes officially joins the Disciple family with vital new EP: Isolation|date=2018-05-29|work=UKF|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en-US}}</ref>

At the end of December 2018, Panda Eyes announced to leave Disciple Records to continue his independent career.<ref>{{cite tweet|number=1079139011057180672|user=RealPandaEyes|title=<!-- full text of tweet that Twitter returned to the bot (excluding links) added by TweetCiteBot.
