They have released 12 albums, including two DJ mixes: one for Ninja Tune's [[Solid Steel]] series and the other for [[Fabric (club)|Fabric's]] [[Fabric Live Mix Albums|Live Mix series]]. The Herbaliser's album [[Same As It Never Was (album)|''Same As It Never Was'']] was their first release on [[!K7 Records]]. Their latest album ''Bring Out The Sound'' was released in 2018, on the BBE label.

Jake Wherry has also recorded solo tracks as [[The Meateaters]], released on the [[Parisian Big Cheese]] label, and has worked with [[The Propheteers]].

Ollie Teeba is also part of [[Soundsci]] with Jonny Cuba of [[Dynamic Syncopation]], Audessey [[ex-Mass Influence]], U-George [[The Hemisphere]] and Oxygen [[Sputnick Brown]]

==History==
Jake Wherry grew up in [[South West (London sub region)|South West London]] and played guitar and bass in a number of jazz, funk and rock bands in his teenage years. During this time, he met Patrick Carpenter aka PC, later one of the DJs behind [[DJ Food]], and through him became aware of the [[Ninja Tune]] label. Ollie Teeba, (real name Ollie Trattles) began DJing at 15 and played his first live sets to London audiences a year later.

Wherry and Teeba met years later at Wherry's Traintrax studio, and began recording together, collaborating with [[DJ Malachi]], [[Kaidi Tatham]] of [[Bugz in the Attic]] and Ralph Lamb of [[Easy Access Orchestra]]. They developed a jazzy instrumental style of hip hop, due to an absence of available rappers. They passed their recordings on to Ninja Tune bosses Matt Black and Jonathan More of [[Coldcut]] and were signed shortly thereafter.

Inspired by the funk bands of previous decades, rather than performing simply with turntables, Jake Wherry decided to take a seven piece band on tour, which included Tatham, Lamb, Andrew Ross, Micah Moody Jnr and percussionist [[Patrick Dawes]]. The band performed in [[Toronto, Ontario]] om 1999.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20000203131448/http://chartattack.com/road/reviews/1999/19990921-herbaliser.html "Live Reviews: The Herbaliser September 8, 1999 The Phoenix, Toronto"]. ''Chart Attack'', review by Mike Doherty, September 8, 1999</ref>

As they progressed, they gained access to guest vocalists for appearances on their records, including What? What? (aka [[Jean Grae]]), [[Roots Manuva]], [[MF Doom]], [[Seaming To]], Rakaa Iriscience of [[Dilated Peoples]], [[Blade (rapper)|Blade]], [[Phi Life Cypher]], [[Bahamadia]] [[Dream Warriors (band)|Dream Warriors]] and [[Insight]] .

The pair were subsequently employed to produce music for the likes of [[Motorola]], the soundtracks to [[Guy Ritchie]]'s ''[[Snatch (film)|Snatch]]'' and the [[PlayStation 2]] game ''[[Tony Hawk's Underground]]''. They were also commissioned to write the theme for [[ESPN]]'s primetime [[NFL]] show ''[[ESPN Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]''.<ref>{{cite web

The group have also provided production for artists including [[T Love]], [[Princess Superstar]] and remixes for artists including [[DJ Food]], [[Raw Stylus]], [[Push Button Objects]], Jaffa and label-mates Coldcut's "Atomic Moog", which reached number one on the UK singles chart.<ref>{{cite web
