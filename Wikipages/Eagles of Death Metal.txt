'''Eagles of Death Metal''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band from [[Palm Desert, California]], formed in 1998. Founded by [[Jesse Hughes (musician)|Jesse Hughes]] (vocals, guitar) and [[Josh Homme]] (drums), the band also includes a wide range of other musicians who perform both on the band's studio albums and at live shows. Hughes and Homme are the only permanent members of the band, with Homme rarely performing at live shows due to commitment to his other band, [[Queens of the Stone Age]]. The band's current touring line-up includes Hughes alongside Josh Jove (guitar), Eden Galindo (guitar), [[Jennie Vee]] (bass) and Jorma Vik (drums).

Despite their name, Eagles of Death Metal are not a [[death metal]] band, and the name is intended to be humorous.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Saunders|first1=Tristram Fane|title=Who are Eagles of Death Metal?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/news/who-are-eagles-death-metal-paris-bataclan-save-a-prayer/|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=November 16, 2015|access-date=3 July 2016}}</ref> In a 2003 interview, Homme described the sound of the band as a combination of "[[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] [[slide guitar]] mixed with stripper drum beats and [[Canned Heat]] vocals." Hughes is known for his enthusiastic interaction with audiences at live performances.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.amoeba.com/music/music-we-like/2006-summer/short-list/eagles-of-death-metal/death-by-sexy.html | title = Eagles of Death Metal: Death By Sexy | publisher = Amoeba Music }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.manchesteracademy.net/eaglesofdeathmet.html | title = Eagles of Death Metal | publisher = Manchester Academy | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070125150845/http://www.manchesteracademy.net/eaglesofdeathmet.html | archive-date = January 25, 2007 | url-status = dead }}</ref>
 
While the band was on stage at the [[Bataclan (theatre)|Bataclan]] in Paris, France, on November 13, 2015, the audience was [[November 2015 Paris attacks|attacked by terrorists]] wielding automatic rifles, grenades, and suicide vests.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/nov/13/shootings-reported-in-eastern-paris-live Paris attacks: France declares state of emergency after dozens killed – live], ''The Guardian'' online.

Three of the band members, singer [[Jesse Hughes (musician)|Jesse Hughes]], guitarist Eden Galindo and drummer [[Julian Dorio]] escaped safely out of the venue via a door backstage, but guitar player [[Dave Catching]] and bass player [[Matt McJunkins]] were unable to escape. The first hid alone in a bathroom stall while the latter hid in a dressing room with several fans, some of them critically injured.  They remained hidden inside the venue and were rescued after several hours by the police with the other survivors.<ref>[http://abc7.com/news/singer-for-eagles-of-death-metal-escapes-paris-attack/1083890/ Singer for Eagles of Death Metal escapes Paris attack], abc7.com (Los Angeles).

In a video interview<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9AEh5s3wdw&t=148 |title=Eagles Of Death Metal Interview |publisher=YouTube |date=1977-02-07 |access-date=2019-01-28}}</ref> taken at a Converse Music-sponsored event at the [[Raymond Revuebar|Soho Revue Bar]] in [[London]], Hughes states that he and Homme were in a bar watching a man dance to the song "[[Wind of Change (Scorpions song)|Wind of Change]]" by the [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]]. When asked what he was doing, the man yelled, "This is death metal, dude!", to which Homme replied, "No, it's not. This is like the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] of death metal." An alternative story concerning the origin of the band name claims that the name originated during an exchange in which a friend of Homme was attempting to convert Hughes to the death metal genre. When the friend played a song by the [[Poland|Polish]] band [[Vader (band)|Vader]] and made a claim that the song was within the death metal genre, Homme then referred to Vader as "the Eagles of death metal". After hearing this phrase, Hughes wondered what a cross between the Eagles and a death metal band would sound like.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.praguepost.com/night-and-day/stage/793-putting-some-fun-in-death-metal.html |title=Putting some fun in death metal – Stage – Night & Day |publisher=The Prague Post |date=March 12, 2009 |access-date=July 18, 2011}}</ref>

==History==

===Early years (1998–2003)===
Eagles of Death Metal formed in [[Palm Desert, California]], in 1998 and first appeared on Josh Homme's [[The Desert Sessions]] ''[[Volumes 3 & 4]]'', released that year. Over the next few years, Homme became distracted from the band due to the success of [[Queens of the Stone Age]]. However, in an October 2008 interview, he reaffirmed his commitment to the band saying, "This isn't a side project for me. I'm in two bands. I have musical [[schizophrenia]], and this is one of those personalities. In brief they are amazing."<ref>{{cite web

The band released their debut album, ''[[Peace, Love, Death Metal]]'', in March 2004. Several songs from the album were used in American [[television commercials]] including those for [[Ask.com]], [[Comcast]], [[Payless ShoeSource]], [[Nissan Motors]], [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]], [[Pontiac (automobile)|Pontiac]] Motors and [[Wendy's]], as well as in the trailer for the film ''[[Thank You for Smoking (film)|Thank You for Smoking]]'' and for a promotional disc for the film ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]],'' which was available at [[Hot Topic]] stores prior to the film's release.

In the fall of 2006, the band had an opening support slot with [[Guns N' Roses]], but this lasted for only one show. [[Axl Rose]] referred to the band as "Pigeons of Shit Metal" from the stage that night, which resulted in Eagles of Death Metal using the phrase on a T-shirt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/guns-n-roses-manager-eagles-of-death-metal-could-not-handle-audience-response/ |title=Guns N' Roses Manager: Eagles Of Death Metal Could Not Handle Audience Response |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=December 1, 2006 |access-date=October 2, 2015}}</ref>
