==History==

===Early years (2004–2011)===

The band was formed in early 2004 by the brothers Trevor and Matthew Wentworth, Tim and Matthew Valich, and Alex "Woody" Woodrow. They released their first EP, ''We've Been Holding Back''. They were still in high school and even then they were attracting more young audiences in New England.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

On October 17, 2005, the group released their second EP, ''Building Cities from Scratch'', but without the participation of Matt Wentworth or Tim Molloy. They were replaced by brothers Nick Perricone on guitar and Joey Perricone on drums.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

After a few lineup changes, the group was complete in 2006 with Trevor Wentworth (vocals), Matt Wentworth (guitar and vocals), Colin Perry (guitar), Alex "Woody" Woodrow (bass guitar) and Tim Molloy (drums). In early 2007, the group signed with Epitaph Records. The day before they embarked on their first tour, Trevor Wentworth was only 13 years old.<ref name="musicemissions">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicemissions.com/artists/Our+Last+Night|title=OUR LAST NIGHT PROFILE PAGE|publisher=Musicemissions.com|access-date=August 21, 2012}}</ref>

==Musical style==
The band's sound has been described as a mixture of [[post-hardcore]] and [[alternative rock]] with some elements of [[metalcore]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/bands/Our-Last-Night/7030 |title=Our Last Night reviews, music, news |publisher=sputnikmusic |access-date=March 2, 2017}}</ref> The early releases featured fewer clean vocal parts while the contemporary material is more melodic with the role of unclean vocals noticeably reduced. Matt Wentworth occasionally plays a downtuned seven-string guitar that helps bring some elements of [[djent]] to the overall sound.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The band's lyrical themes have been compared [[We Came as Romans]] and [[the Color Morale]] for their positive messages in their songs that deal with "hope and love in face of depression".<ref>{{Cite web|title=INTERVIEW: Our Last Night - SA Music Scene|url=http://samusicscene.co.za/wp/interview-our-last-night/|access-date=May 15, 2021}}</ref> On May 28, 2021, the band released "Cold Blooded", an original single with co-lead vocalist Trevor Wentworth incorporating rap vocals into the band's style.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}
