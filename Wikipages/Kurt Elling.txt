'''Kurt Elling''' (born November 2, 1967) is an American [[jazz]] singer and songwriter.

Born in [[Chicago, Illinois]], and raised in [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]], Elling became interested in music through his father, who was Kapellmeister at a Lutheran church.  He sang in choirs and played musical instruments. He encountered jazz while a student at [[Gustavus Adolphus College]] in Minnesota. After college, he enrolled in the [[University of Chicago Divinity School]], but he left one credit short of a degree to pursue a career as a jazz vocalist.

Elling began to perform around Chicago, [[scat singing]] and improvising his lyrics.  He recorded a demo in the early 1990s and was signed by [[Blue Note Records|Blue Note]]. He has been nominated for ten Grammy Awards, winning [[Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album|Best Vocal Jazz Album]] for ''[[Dedicated to You: Kurt Elling Sings the Music of Coltrane and Hartman|Dedicated to You]]'' (2009) and ''[[Secrets Are the Best Stories]] ''(2021).  Elling often leads the ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine Critics' Poll. He had a longtime collaboration with pianist [[Laurence Hobgood]], leading a quartet that toured throughout the world.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Kurt Elling Biography |url=http://kurtelling.com/news/assets/KE.bio.long.pdf |publisher=Depth of Field Management |date=June 17, 2010 |access-date=2010-06-27}}</ref>

==Early life==
Kurt Elling was born in Chicago, Illinois on November 2, 1967, the son of Henry and Martha Elling. His interest in music started with his father, who was [[Kapellmeister]] at a Lutheran church.<ref name="Byrnes">{{cite news |last=Byrnes |first=Sholto |date=October 14, 2007 |title=Kurt Elling: This cat can scat! |newspaper=[[The Independent]]}} See also: {{cite web |url=http://kurtelling.com/news/faq.html |title=Kurt Elling FAQ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328133756/http://kurtelling.com/news/faq.html |archive-date=March 28, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Elling attended elementary school at St. Paul Lutheran School in [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rrstar.com/updates/x1609347422/Kurt-Elling-coming-to-Coronado-Aug-6 |date=July 2, 2010 |title=Kurt Elling coming to Coronado Aug. 6 |publisher=[[The Rockford Register Star]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120914000023/http://www.rrstar.com/updates/x1609347422/Kurt-Elling-coming-to-Coronado-Aug-6 |archive-date=September 14, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> and throughout his early years, he sang in choirs and played violin, French horn, piano, and drums. During his middle school years, Elling remembers watching [[Tony Bennett]] and the [[Woody Herman]] band on television and imagining what it would be like to sing with a band.<ref name="Yanow" /> Growing up, Elling sang in the classical style, learning [[counterpoint]] from the [[motet]]s of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].

At [[Rockford Lutheran High School]], in Rockford, Illinois, Elling continued to sing in the choir: "When it was undeniably uncool and geeky and all that, to be the choir, I did it anyway, because it was reliably beautiful, and it was rewarding, and it gave me gifts of experience and friendships." One of these experiences was that of singing the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|National Anthem]] with the high school madrigal choir, "Joyful Sounds" under the direction of Joyce Kortze in front of his first large crowd of over 40,000 people.<ref name="vmc1">{{cite web |last=Elling |first=Kurt |date=November 16, 2007 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnQ2fJIR94s |title=Master Class: Kurt Elling on His Early Musical Training |publisher=YouTube |location=Concert Hall of the Community Music School of [[Webster University]], St. Louis, Missouri}}</ref>

[[File:Green Mill Cocktail Lounge.jpg|thumb|Elling became known in Chicago from his weekly gigs at the [[Green Mill Jazz Club]], where he met pianist Laurence Hobgood through saxophonist Ed Petersen.]]

Elling attended [[Gustavus Adolphus College]] in St. Peter, Minnesota, where he majored in history and minored in religion. In college, Elling sang in the 70-voice Gustavus Choir, an a cappella choir that performed works from a variety of different composers, allowing him to hone his technical skills. Elling also toured Europe with his college choir.<ref name="vmc1" /> He became interested in jazz at Gustavus Adolphus while listening to [[Dave Brubeck]], [[Dexter Gordon]], [[Herbie Hancock]], and [[Ella Fitzgerald]].<ref name="Makos" />

After graduating from Gustavus Adolphus in 1989, Elling enrolled in graduate school at the [[University of Chicago Divinity School]] where he studied for his master's degree in [[philosophy of religion]].<ref name="Yanow">{{cite book |last=Yanow |first=Scott |year=2008 |title=The Jazz Singers: The Ultimate Guide |publisher=Music Dispatch |isbn=978-0-87930-825-4 |page=72}}</ref> He thought about continuing work in academia or working for the [[World Council of Churches]] when he graduated.<ref name="Byrnes" /> He began playing jazz gigs once a week during graduate school, with one of his first shows at Milt Trenier's, a basement club in Chicago (now defunct). He earned little money at these gigs, but Karl Johnson, the house pianist, was his mentor and teacher.<ref name="faq">{{cite web |url=http://kurtelling.com/news/faq.html |title=Kurt Elling FAQ |publisher=kurtelling.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328133756/http://kurtelling.com/news/faq.html |archive-date=March 28, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Elling recalls, "By day I was reading Kant and Schleiermacher, trying to get a handle on that, and at night I was sitting-in in clubs, and, of course, you can't do both and be effective.

In Chicago, Elling worked as a bartender and as a mover. He sang at weddings in addition to clubs. At this time, he began singing in a scat style and improvising his own lyrics.<ref name="Makos">{{cite journal |last=Makos |first=Jeff |date=June 1997 |url=http://magazine.uchicago.edu/9706/9706Vocal.html |title=Vocal Ease |journal=The University of Chicago Magazine |volume=89–90 |publisher=University of Chicago |page=26}}</ref> Elling began listening to the vocalese of jazz singer [[Mark Murphy (singer)|Mark Murphy]], who exposed him to the poetry of [[Jack Kerouac]]. The minimalism and emotion of [[Chet Baker]]'s music was also influential.

==Career==
While living in Chicago in 1995, Elling decided he was ready to record. He had met pianist Laurence Hobgood through Ed Petersen, who played the Green Mill on Monday nights. Elling convinced Hobgood that he was ready to go into the studio, and they came out with nine solid songs. Following the advice of pianist [[Fred Simon (musician)|Fred Simon]], the cassette recording was sent to Bill Traut, a manager in Los Angeles, who eventually gave it to [[Bruce Lundvall]] of [[Blue Note Records|Blue Note]].<ref name="cye">{{cite web |last=Elling |first=Kurt |url=http://kurtelling.com/music/close_your_eyes/ |title=Close Your Eyes |publisher=kurtelling.com}}</ref>

In 1995, Elling signed with Blue Note, and the songs on the demo became the Grammy nominated label debut, ''[[Close Your Eyes (Kurt Elling album)|Close Your Eyes]]'' (1995).<ref>{{cite web |last=Schneider |first=Mike |author-link=Mike Schneider (news anchor) |year=2009 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHJqaagF0ZQ |title=Night Talk: An Interview with Kurt Elling |publisher=[[Bloomberg Television]]}}</ref> The album features Edward Petersen and [[Von Freeman]] on tenor saxophone, Dave Onderdonk on guitar, Laurence Hobgood on piano, Eric Hochberg and Rob Amster on double bass, and [[Paul Wertico]] on drums.

[[File:Kurt Elling2.jpg|thumb|left|Elling performing in 2006]]


In 2006, Elling performed on the television program ''[[Legends of Jazz]]'', in the episode "The Jazz Singers". Elling sang "She's Funny That Way" and performed a duet with [[Al Jarreau]] on "[[Take Five]]". The recording was released on CD and DVD. In August of the same year, Elling signed a  contract with [[Concord Jazz]], and his first album with the label, ''[[Nightmoves (album)|Nightmoves]]'', was released in 2007.

The follow-up, ''[[Dedicated to You: Kurt Elling Sings the Music of Coltrane and Hartman]]'' (2009), is a tribute to the 1963 recording ''[[John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman]]'', widely recognized as one of the all-time finest jazz vocal albums.<ref name=chinen1>{{cite news |last=Chinen |first=Nate |date=January 23, 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/24/arts/music/24elli.html |title=Playfully Laying Claim to Songs of Two Jazz Greats |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=2010-07-04 }}</ref> The album arose out of a 2005 concert commissioned by the [[Chicago Jazz Festival]], showcasing the Coltrane-Hartman material. Later, Elling and pianist Laurence Hobgood rearranged the music, culminating in a performance in the Allen Room at the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]] in New York. The concert was recorded in January 2009 and the album was released in June.<ref name=schudel>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/26/AR2009022603669.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |first=Matt |last=Schudel |title=A Tribute Supreme |date=February 27, 2009 |access-date=July 4, 2010}}</ref>

Elling is a baritone with a four-octave range, and a writer and performer of [[vocalese]], writing and performing words over improvised jazz solos. In 2007 and 2012, [[Circumstantial Productions]] published two editions of ''Lyrics: Kurt Elling'', collections of Elling's vocalese lyrics edited by Richard Connolly.

In 1999, Elling became a National Trustee for the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]], and in 2003 he was elected vice-chair and served two terms.

==Collaborators==
Elling has performed and recorded with [[David Amram]], [[Randy Bachman]], [[Bob Belden]], [[Joanne Brackeen]], [[Oscar Brown Jr.]], [[Jodie Christian]], [[Billy Corgan]], [[Orbert Davis]], [[George Freeman (guitarist)|George Freeman]], [[Buddy Guy]], [[Jon Hendricks]], [[Charlie Hunter]],  [[Bob Mintzer]], [[Brad Mehldau]], [[Lee Ritenour]], [[John Pizzarelli]], and [[Bob Sheppard (musician)|Bob Sheppard]].

Until November 2013, Elling's band included musical director [[Laurence Hobgood]] on piano, John McLean on guitar, Clark Sommers on bass, and drummer [[Kendrick Scott]]. Howard Reich's wrote in his November 6, 2013 column "My kind of Jazz" in the ''Chicago Tribune'', that Elling and Hobgood would be going separate ways. Hobgood linked to that article from his website. Elling's website announced the change on November 12, 2013.<ref>{{cite web |date=November 12, 2013 |url=http://kurtelling.com/news/kurtsnews_2013.php?newsEntry=852 |title=Kurt Elling's New Directions}}</ref>

The band included a rotating series of pianists until October 2015 when [[Gary Versace]] became Kurt Elling's first-call pianist and was added to the Band page on Elling's website. Then in August 2016, Stu Mindeman took over as piano chair and Versace's page was moved to Extended Family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kurtelling.com/band/|title=Kurt Elling – Band|website=Kurtelling.com|access-date=October 9, 2021}}</ref>

In 2016 he was a member of [[Branford Marsalis]]'s quartet. He toured with the band and performed on the album ''Upward Spiral'', which was nominated for a Grammy Award. Marsalis co-produced Elling's album ''[[The Questions (album)|The Questions]]'' and performed on three songs.<ref name="apprehend">{{cite journal |last1=Morrison |first1=Jim |title=Apprehend the Greatest Ideas |journal=DownBeat |date=June 2018 |volume=85 |issue=June 2018 |pages=38–42 |location=Elmhurst, Illinois}}</ref>
