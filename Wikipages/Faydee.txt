==Early life and education==
Fady was born into a Muslim family on 2 February 1987 in Sydney, Australia. His parents originated from [[Tripoli, Lebanon]]. Fady is the oldest of five children, with two sisters and two brothers. Fady's interest in music began through his cousins, who would record beats and rap and sing over them for entertainment. At the age of thirteen, he began writing and recording music from his bedroom.<ref name=oneavenue>{{cite web|url=http://oneavenue.tv/2015/07/06/faydee-is-live-on-one-on-oneavenue-tv-exclusive-interview/|title=Faydee Is Live on One on OneAvenue.tv – Exclusive Interview|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150726133123/http://oneavenue.tv/2015/07/06/faydee-is-live-on-one-on-oneavenue-tv-exclusive-interview/|archive-date=26 July 2015}}</ref>

==Career==
Faydee was discovered online at the age of 19 by Ronnie Diamond,<ref name=ronniediamond>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/ronnie.diamond.1694|title=Ronnie Diamond Facebook}}{{Primary source inline|date=January 2018}}</ref> owner / founder of record label Buckle Up Entertainment.<ref name=buckleup>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/buckleupentertainment/|title=Buckle Up Entertainment Facebook}}{{Primary source inline|date=January 2018}}</ref> After signing with Buckle Up, Faydee wrote several songs and, in the process, honed his writing, production and recording techniques. In 2008, Faydee partnered with producer Divy Pota<ref name=divypote>{{cite web|url=http://www.divypota.com/|title=Divy Pota}}</ref> to develop his sound and sonically trademark his style. The pair had a string of increasingly successful releases including "I Should've Known",<ref name=ishould>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reA1zcDSQuM|title=I Should've Known}}</ref> "Never Saw Me Coming", "Psycho",<ref name=psycho>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tDZ9ew1DN0|title=Psycho}}</ref> "Say My Name"<ref name=saymyname>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y44_kWSoiPc|title=Say My Name}}</ref> and "Forget the World".<ref name=forgettheworld>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7gkDhGNoq4|title=Forget the World}}</ref> The positive response to these releases landed Faydee at the forefront of the Australian music industry within a short time of entering the market. Meanwhile, Faydee used the power of the internet to reach an international audience, and while progressing in the Australian market, was also able to develop a grassroots following all around the world.

In 2013, Faydee released R&B crossover hit "Laugh Till You Cry",<ref name=laughtillyoucry>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaTawbEn_d4|title=Laugh Till You Cry}}</ref> primarily as a way to reach members of his audience who identified with urban music, in a time when dance/EDM was dominating the charts. "Laugh Till You Cry" was produced by Divy Pota and features fellow Australian artist Lazy J. The song became a pan-European and international hit for Faydee, and went on to hold the No. 1 position on the Romania Hot 100 Airplay Charts for 6 consecutive weeks.<ref name=romaniahot100>{{cite web|url=http://www.whalereport.com/global-analysis.php#by=artist&term=faydee|title=Romania Hot 100 Airplay Charts|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202064351/http://www.whalereport.com/global-analysis.php#by=artist&term=faydee|archive-date=2 February 2017}}</ref> "Laugh Till You Cry" was followed up by a series of similarly successful releases, including "Can't Let Go"<ref name=candletgo>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_YcD_yESk8|title=Can't Let Go}}</ref> and "Maria",<ref name=maria>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hp8-hwSlOg|title=Maria}}</ref> which both earned significant airplay on commercial radio in several international territories. "Can't Let Go" has received over 100 million views on YouTube to date.

In 2014, Faydee released the bilingual English/Arabic song "[[Habibi (I Need Your Love)]]", which would go on to become a major turning point in his career, earning him accolades such as his first appearance on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, as well as a BMI Award for his writing on the record. "I Need Your Love" was a collaboration with Shaggy, Mohombi, and Costi Ionita. Faydee wrote the song and co-produced the track with Ionita, and Faydee's vocals appear in the chorus, first verse, and as the main hook throughout the song. "I Need Your Love" took the world by storm and was a hit on commercial radio as well as sales charts in several major music markets. The song peaked at No. 66 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, No. 20 on Billboard US Mainstream Top 40, No. 27 on Billboard US Rhythmic, No. 36 UK Singles Chart. In 2016, "I Need Your Love" was certified Gold in the US by RIAA, recognising sales in excess of 500,000.<ref name=riaa>{{cite web|url=http://headlineplanet.com/home/2015/03/08/iggy-azalea-jennifer-hudson-fifth-harmony-reach-pops-top-40/|title="I Need Your Love" was certified Gold in the US by RIAA}}</ref>

After "I Need Your Love", Faydee released "Lullaby", which was a commercial success, peaking at No. 9 on the Romania Radio Charts, and also appearing in the top 10 iTunes charts in several territories including Romania, Cyprus and Moldova.<ref name=itunes>{{cite web|url=http://www.whalereport.com/global-analysis.php#by=artist&term=FAYDEE&showall=true|title=Top 10 iTunes Romania, Cyprus and Moldova|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202064351/http://www.whalereport.com/global-analysis.php#by=artist&term=FAYDEE&showall=true|archive-date=2 February 2017}}</ref> Also in late 2015, Faydee released his single "Sun Don't Shine", which marked his return to collaboration with producer Divy Pota. It peaked at No. 1 on the iTunes chart in Bulgaria and Azerbaijan,<ref name=azerbaijian>{{cite web|url=http://top40-charts.com/song.php?sid=43982|title=No. 1 on the iTunes chart in Bulgaria and Azerbaijan}}</ref> as well as appearing in the top 10 iTunes chart of several other territories.

2016 was another growth year for Faydee. In March 2016, Faydee released the EP ''Legendary'', a five-song collaboration with Divy Pota. It included the title single "Legendary", fan favourites "Amari", "If I Didn't Love You", "Ya Linda" and "Jealous". The EP was well received by industry and audience alike. 2016 also saw him release a number of successful records, including "Love in Dubai" with [[DJ Sava]], "Nobody" with [[Kat Deluna]] and [[Leftside]], "Believe" with German rapper [[Kay One (rapper)|Kay One]]. These releases were backed up by a vigorous touring schedule, and overall in 2016 Faydee saw his YouTube subscribers exceed 500,000, his Facebook likes exceed 600,000, and his Shazam followers surpass the 2 million mark.

"Love in Dubai", with DJ Sava, quickly became a summer party anthem in Europe and the Middle East, peaking at No. 1 on the Top 40 chart in Bulgaria,<ref name=bulgaria40>{{cite web|url=http://www.whalereport.com/global-analysis.php#by=artist&term=FAYDEE&showall=true|title=#1 on the Top 40 chart in Bulgaria|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202064351/http://www.whalereport.com/global-analysis.php#by=artist&term=FAYDEE&showall=true|archive-date=2 February 2017}}</ref> top 10 on Shazam in UAE and top 5 on Shazam in Dubai.  In August 2016, Faydee released "Believe", a collaboration with German [[Kay One (rapper)|Kay One]]. A music video was released featuring both performers.
