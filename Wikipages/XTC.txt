'''XTC''' were<!-- Per WP:ENGVAR, UK English uses the plural form for bands, groups, etc. Do not change "were" to "was". --> an English [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Swindon]] in 1972. Fronted by songwriters [[Andy Partridge]] (guitars, vocals) and [[Colin Moulding]] (bass, vocals), the band gained popularity during the rise of [[punk rock|punk]] and [[New wave music|new wave]] in the 1970s, later playing in a variety of styles that ranged from angular guitar riffs to elaborately arranged [[pop music|pop]]. Partly because the group did not fit into contemporary trends, they achieved only sporadic commercial success in the UK and US, but attracted a considerable [[cult following]] there and in Japan. They have since been recognised for their influence on [[post-punk]], [[Britpop]] and later [[power pop]] acts.

Partridge and Moulding first met in the early 1970s and subsequently formed a [[glam punk|glam]] outfit with drummer [[Terry Chambers]]. The band's name and line-up changed frequently, and it was not until 1975 that the band was known as XTC. In 1977, the group debuted on [[Virgin Records]] and were subsequently noted for their energetic live performances and their refusal to play conventional punk rock, instead synthesising influences from [[ska]], 1960s pop, [[dub music]] and the [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]]. The single "[[Making Plans for Nigel]]" (1979) marked their commercial breakthrough and heralded the [[gated reverb|reverberating drum sound]] associated with 1980s popular music.

Between 1979 and 1992, XTC had a total of 10 albums and 6 singles that reached the UK top 40, including "[[Sgt. Rock (Is Going to Help Me)]]" (1980) and "[[Senses Working Overtime]]" (1982). After 1982's ''[[English Settlement]]'', the band stopped [[concert tour]]ing and became a studio-based project centred on Partridge, Moulding, and guitarist [[Dave Gregory (musician)|Dave Gregory]].  A spin-off group, [[the Dukes of Stratosphear]], was invented as a one-off excursion into 1960s-style [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]], but as XTC's music evolved, the distinctions between the two bands lessened. XTC continued to produce more [[progressive music|progressive]] records, including the albums ''[[Skylarking]]'' (1986), ''[[Oranges & Lemons (album)|Oranges & Lemons]]'' (1989), and ''[[Nonsuch (album)|Nonsuch]]'' (1992). In the US, "[[Mayor of Simpleton]]" (1989) was their highest-charting single, while "[[Dear God (XTC song)|Dear God]]" (1986) was controversial for its [[antireligion|anti-religious]] message.

Due to poor management, XTC never received a share of profits from record sales (of which there were millions), nor from touring revenue, forcing them into [[debt]] throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In 1993, they went on [[strike action|strike]] against Virgin, citing an unfair [[recording contract]], and soon extricated themselves from the label. Gregory left the band during the making of ''[[Apple Venus Volume 1]]'' (1999), after which the XTC name briefly served as a banner for what were effectively solo efforts by Partridge and Moulding. In 2006, Partridge announced that his creative partnership with Moulding had disintegrated, leaving XTC "in the past tense". Moulding and Chambers briefly reunited as the duo [[TC&I (band)|TC&I]] in the late 2010s. Partridge and Gregory remain musically active. {{toclimit|3}}

==1972–1982: Early years and touring==
===Formation===
[[File:David Murray John Tower, Swindon - geograph.org.uk - 281394.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A view of [[Swindon]] in 2007]]

[[Andy Partridge]] and [[Colin Moulding]] grew up on Penhill [[council estate]] in [[Swindon]]. Partridge jokingly characterised the community as being populated almost entirely by people with physical, mental or emotional defects.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=XTC: Ninjas of the Mundane|date=20 April 1989|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> In the 1960s, he was a fan of contemporary pop groups like [[the Beatles]], but was intimidated by the process of learning guitar. When [[the Monkees]] grew popular, he became interested in joining a music group. He recalled watching local guitarist [[Dave Gregory (musician)|Dave Gregory]] performing [[Jimi Hendrix]]-style songs at churches and youth clubs: "Sort of [[acid rock|acid]]-[[skiffle]]. I thought, 'Ah, one day I'll play guitar!' But I didn't think I would be in the same band as this kid on the stage."<ref name="Contrast1990" /> Partridge eventually obtained a guitar and taught himself how to play it with no formal training.<ref name="Contrast1990" /> At the age of 15, he wrote his first song, titled "Please Help Me",{{sfn|Rachel|2014|p=200}} and attracted the nickname "Rocky" for his early guitar mastery of the Beatles' "[[Rocky Raccoon]]" (1968).<ref name="Mojo1999">{{cite journal|last=Ingham|first=Chris|title=XTC – 'Til Death Do Us Part|journal=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]|date=March 1999}}</ref> By the early 1970s, his music tastes had transitioned "from the Monkees to having a big binge on this Euro-avant-garde stuff. I got really in deep."<ref name="Contrast1990" /> One of his first bands was called "Stiff Beach", formed in August 1970.{{sfn|Gimarc|2005|pp=1, 10}} In early 1972, Partridge's constantly evolving group settled into "Star Park", a four-piece that featured himself with guitarist Dave Cartner, drummer Paul Wilson, and a bassist nicknamed "Nervous Steve".{{sfn|Twomey|1992|pp=37–39}}

In 1972, Partridge became closer acquainted with Gregory, a [[diabetes|diabetic]] then suffering from a bout of [[Mood disorder|depression]],<ref name="Mojo1999"/> while working as an assistant at the Bon Marche record shop in Swindon.<ref>{{cite tweet |user=xtcfans |last=Partridge |first=Andy |author-link=Andy Partridge |number=1090237415409762304 |date=29 January 2019|title=WIKI CORRECTOR-"Gregory was playing the Mahavishnu Orchestra's album The Inner Mounting Flame (1971), which he later called "one of the watershed moments in my musical education."

(now Long's).}}</ref> Moulding had been playing bass since 1970 "because I liked music [and] I thought that playing a bass, with four strings, would be infinitely easier than playing a guitar, with six strings. That was a horrible misconception!".<ref name="brenda">{{cite journal |last1=Brenda |first1=Herrmann |title=Colin Moulding: The Agony and the XTC  |journal=Bass Player |pages=14–16 |date=September 1992}}</ref> At the end of 1972, Moulding and drummer [[Terry Chambers]] joined Partridge's band, replacing Nervous Steve and Paul Wilson, and the group was renamed "Star Park (Mark II)".{{sfn|Twomey|1992|pp=37–39}} Other members would frequently join and leave the group.<ref name="Contrast1990" />

===Local popularity, rise of punk and label signing===
After Star Park opened for [[Thin Lizzy]] in May 1973,{{sfn|Rachel|2014|p=203}} the band renamed themselves the Helium Kidz.<ref name="Contrast1990"/> Partridge's musical conceptions were "blown away" upon hearing the [[New York Dolls]]: "I suddenly just wanted to play three chords again and get out my mum's makeup and stuff."<ref name="Contrast1990" /> He subsequently wrote hundreds of songs for the Helium Kidz, and some demo tapes were sent to [[Decca Records]].<ref name="Contrast1990">{{cite magazine |last1=Bookasta |first1=Randy |last2=Howard |first2=David |title=Season Cyclers |magazine=Contrast |issue=7 |date=1990}}</ref> ''[[NME]]'' ran a small profile on the "up and coming" band, which consisted of Partridge, Moulding, Chambers and guitarist Dave Cartner: "They aspire to attain the impossible dream of being able to throw a TV or two out of the window of an American hotel and have no one complain."{{sfn|Gimarc|2005|p=17}} This version of the group lasted until 1975, when the Helium Kidz decided to rebrand themselves and change their music to "three-minute pop songs that were fast and inventive."<ref name="Contrast1990" /> Gregory auditioned for the band at this juncture, but did not end up joining.<ref name="Mojo1999"/> His musicianship was determined to be "too good".{{sfn|Farmer|1998|p=60}}

It was decided that the band have another name change. "The Dukes of Stratosphear" was considered, but Partridge thought it was too "flowery" and "psychedelic".<ref name="Contrast1990" /> He derived "XTC" from [[Jimmy Durante]]'s exclamation upon discovering [[The Lost Chord|the lost chord]]: "That's it! I'm in ecstasy!".{{sfn|Rachel|2014|p=203}} The name was chosen mainly for its emphatic appearance in print.<ref name="Milano84">{{cite news |last1=Milano |first1=Bret |title=An exclusive and revealing discussion with the band's eloquent frontman |newspaper=Fairfield County Advocate |date=7 November 1984}}</ref> Meanwhile, owing to creative differences with Partridge, synthesizer player Jonathan Perkins quit the band.<ref name="Chicago2000">{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=J.R. |title=Too Much of a God Thing |url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/too-much-of-a-god-thing/Content?oid=902571 |newspaper=[[Chicago Reader]] |date=12 June 2000}}</ref> In search of his replacement, Partridge found [[Barry Andrews (musician)|Barry Andrews]] through a "keyboard player seeks band" advertisement. Instead of a formal audition, the two went out drinking together.<ref name="Mojo1999"/> Andrews was immediately hired. During the first band rehearsal, Partridge recalled, "He sounded like [[Jon Lord]] from [[Deep Purple]]; fuzz box, wah wah pedal, bluesy runs. I said, You don't have to play like that, you can play like us if you want. The next rehearsal, he was like a maniac, like if [[Joan Miró|Miró]] had played electric organ.

===''White Music'' and ''Go 2''===
In August 1977, XTC made their first commercially released studio recordings with producer [[John Leckie]] at [[Abbey Road Studios|Abbey Road]], which appeared on their debut album ''[[3D EP]]'' in October.<ref name="Mojo1999"/> Their first full-length record, ''[[White Music]]'', was then recorded in less than two weeks, and released for January 1978. Partridge characterized the album as "[[Captain Beefheart]] meets [[the Archies]]" shrouded in 1950s-style [[retrofuturism]]. He reflected that the album was the sum of everything the band enjoyed, including the Beatles, [[Sun Ra]], and [[Atomic Rooster]],<ref name="Mojo1999"/> but dismissed the contents as premature songs "built around this electric wordplay stuff".<ref name="agony1992">{{cite journal |last1=Friedman |first1=Roger |title=The Agony of XTC |journal=Guitar |date=October 1992}}</ref> ''White Music'' reached number 38 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name="OCC" /> Although the album was well received by the press (''Melody Maker'', ''NME'', ''Sounds'', and ''Record Mirror'' all gave positive reviews{{sfn|Twomey|1992|p=74}}), none of its singles managed to chart.<ref name="Mojo1999"/><ref name="XTCAMbio"/> They rerecorded "[[This Is Pop]]" as a lead single. Its follow-up, "[[Statue of Liberty (song)|Statue of Liberty]]", was banned on [[BBC Radio]] due to the lyric "I sail beneath her skirt".<ref name="Mojo1999"/> With each member placed on a £25 weekly salary,<ref name="Mojo1999"/> the band toured perpetually for the next five years.<ref name="Dom2000">{{cite news |last1=Dominic |first1=Serene |title=XTC: Stupidly Happy Ever After |url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/xtc-stupidly-happy-ever-after-6417095 |newspaper=[[Phoenix New Times]]|date=11 May 2000}}</ref> The group also made appearances on the children's television shows ''[[Tiswas]]'' and ''[[Magpie (TV series)|Magpie]]'',<ref name="Mojo1999"/> which meant they would occasionally play for under-16 crowds on these early tours.{{sfn|Twomey|1992|pp=75–76}} Partridge enjoyed these early shows, but would later resent touring as the band's audience numbers grew and the performing experience became more impersonal.<ref name="Milano84" />

[[File:Go 2 by XTC (1978).jpg|thumb|The ''[[Go 2]]'' cover art, designed by [[Hipgnosis]], featured a wall of text beginning with "This is a record cover. This writing is the design ...". The marketing satire was received with critical acclaim.<ref name="Mojo1999"/>]]

By August 1978, XTC were prepared to record their next album.{{sfn|DeRogatis|2003|p=341}} The band had contacted [[Brian Eno]] to produce after they learned that he was a fan, but he declined, telling them that they were good enough to produce themselves.<ref name="Mojo1999"/> Virgin rejected Eno's advice, and the group instead returned to Abbey Road with Leckie. Andrews appeared at the sessions with several original songs, but Partridge did not feel they were right for the band. He began taking Moulding and Chambers out for drinks without inviting Partridge, allegedly in an attempt to take over the group. After most of Andrews' songs were dropped from the final track list, the keyboardist told journalists that he foresaw the band "explod[ing] pretty soon".<ref name="Mojo1999"/> ''[[Go 2]]'', a more experimental venture, was released in October to positive reviews and a number 21 chart peak.<ref name="Mojo1999"/> Like ''White Music'', it was given praise in ''Sounds'', ''Melody Maker'', and the ''NME''.{{sfn|Twomey|1992|p=79}} One of the tracks, "Battery Brides (Andy Paints Brian)", was written in tribute to Eno.{{sfn|DeRogatis|2003|p=341}} The album also included a bonus EP, ''Go+'', which consisted of five dub remixes of XTC songs.<ref name="Mojo1999"/>

Andrews left the band in December 1978, while they were on their first American tour,<ref name="Mojo1999"/> and went on to form [[The League of Gentlemen (band)|the League of Gentlemen]] with [[Robert Fripp]] of [[King Crimson]].<ref name="XTCAMbio"/> Partridge said: "He enjoyed undermining what little authority I had in the band. We were bickering quite a lot. But when he left I thought, Oh shit, that's the sound of the band gone, this space-cream over everything. And I did enjoy his brain power, the verbal and mental fencing."<ref name="Mojo1999"/> XTC went through a "silly half-hearted" process of auditioning another keyboardist.<ref name="Contrast1990" /> Although [[Thomas Dolby]] was rumoured as a replacement, Partridge said that Dolby was never actually considered.<ref>{{cite tweet |user=xtcfans |last=Partridge |first=Andy |author-link=Andy Partridge |number=1090243249112076288|title=WC- Regarding auditioning others after Barry's departure..."Thomas Dolby was in the running, but he was rejected" No, this is a myth, Thomas was not considered. He had his own future to look after.|date=29 January 2019}}</ref>

[[File:XTC live.jpg|thumb|left|XTC performing live (pictured from left: Gregory and Partridge)]]

Rather than hiring a replacement keyboardist, Dave Gregory of the covers band Dean Gabber and His Gaberdines was invited to join as a second guitarist. Partridge remembered holding a "pretend audition" where Gregory was asked to play "This Is Pop", only for Gregory to inquire whether they wanted the album version or the single version: "We thought, 'Bloody oh, a real musician.' But he was in the band before he even knew."<ref name="Contrast1990" /> Gregory was anxious of whether the fans would accept him as a member, characterizing himself as "the archetypal [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|pub-rocker]] in jeans and long hair. But the fans weren't bothered. Nobody was fashionable in XTC, ever."<ref name="Mojo1999"/> He grew more comfortable with the group after playing a few shows, he said, "and things got better and better".<ref name="Mojo1999"/>

To follow up "Nigel", the band released "Wait Till Your Boat Goes Down" (1980), a [[reggae]]-influenced Partridge song with production by [[Phil Wainman]] of [[Bay City Rollers]] fame.

From 1980 to 1981, XTC toured Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US in support of ''Black Sea'' as the opening act for [[the Police]]. At this point, they were playing in arena stadiums while Partridge's mental state was beginning to deteriorate, and he requested to cease touring, but was opposed by Virgin, his bandmates, and the band's management.<ref name="Mojo1999"/> He would occasionally experience moments of memory lapse to the extent that he would forget who he was.{{sfn|Twomey|1992|p=3}} His then-wife Marianne blamed his illness on his longtime dependency on [[Valium]],<ref name="Sailed2006" /> which he had been prescribed since the age of 12.{{sfn|Partridge|Bernhardt|2016}} She threw away the tablets,<ref name="Sailed2006" /> and over the next year, he experienced intense withdrawal effects that he later described as "brain melt".<ref name="teamrock16"/>

The group scheduled television appearances and an international tour in support of ''English Settlement''. During a live-broadcast gig in Paris, Partridge ran off the stage, and afterward, took a flight back to Swindon for treatment, which amounted to [[hypnotherapy]]. He described feeling nausea and stomach pains while on stage: "My body and brain said, You're hating this experience I'm going to make it bad for you. When you go on stage I'm going to give you panic attacks and stomach cramps. You're not enjoying this and you haven't got the heart to tell anyone you can't carry on so I'm gonna mess you up."<ref name="Mojo1999"/>  The band's remaining tour dates in England were cancelled.<ref name="Sailed2006" /> After recovering from the episode, Partridge rejoined the group for their first tour of the US as a headlining act.<ref name="Sailed2006" /> The band played the first date in San Diego. Gregory said that they were "totally unrehearsed" during the performance because "we'd not played together for two weeks. ... It was obvious that he was ill, but exactly what it was, no-one knew."<ref name="Ramon"/>

On 4 April 1982, XTC were scheduled to headline a sold-out show at the [[Hollywood Palladium]] in Los Angeles.<ref>Kristine McKenna, "XTC and the ABC's of Topical Pop", ''The Los Angeles Times'', April 4, 1982. Retrieved via Newspapers.com.</ref> Partridge woke up that morning, he said, and "couldn't get off the bed. My legs wouldn't function. Walked to Ben Frank's coffee shop, where we'd all agreed to meet, in slow motion like I had both legs in plaster, trying not to throw up. I got in there, they knew what I was going to say."<ref name="Mojo1999"/> The tour ceased. He continued his hypnotherapy treatment, fearing that he was turning into the archetypal rock burn-out (such as [[Syd Barrett]]). "It got to the point where if I touched the front door knob, I wanted to throw up."<ref name="Mojo1999"/> For a period afterward, it was rumoured among fans and industry insiders that the group stopped performing because Partridge had died, and some American bands put on XTC tribute shows in his remembrance.<ref name="Milano84" />

The cancelled American tour incurred XTC with a £20,000 debt, and since it left them unable to record new material, they decided to reexamine their financial affairs.{{sfn|Twomey|1992|p=127}} Confused as to where their earnings had gone, the group requested that manager Ian Reid help pay for the debts, but he refused, saying that they had owed him money. They tried distancing themselves from Reid by renegotiating their contract with Virgin. Six more albums were promised to the label in exchange for covering their debts, as well as a guarantee that subsequent royalty and advancement cheques be redirected into the band's own deposit account. Royalty rates were still kept relatively low, as the group's A&R man Paul Kinder explained, they had "appalling management for a number of years. Usually if a manager has got any kind of business acumen he will renegotiate the contract to get a better royalty. A record company expects this, which is why they keep royalties low initially. It's just business really. Nobody addressed the contract for XTC."<ref name="Mojo1999"/>

Reid remained XTC's manager until January 1983 (according to the book ''Chalkhills and Children''){{sfn|Twomey|1992|p=131}} or a couple years afterward (according to Partridge).<ref name="TrainPar">{{cite web |last1=Bernhardt |first1=Todd |last2=Partridge |first2=Andy |author-link2=Andy Partridge |url=http://chalkhills.org/articles/XTCFans20090614.html |title=Andy discusses "Train Running Low on Soul Coal"|website=Chalkhills |date=14 June 2009}}</ref> He legally retained the title of XTC's manager until near the end of the decade.<ref>{{cite tweet |user=xtcfans |last=Partridge |first=Andy |author-link=Andy Partridge |date=29 January 2019|number=1090251077918908416|title=WC-"Reid was no longer the band's manager, but legally retained the title until around 1985[.]" No, we finally parted ways in 88-89 I think. Colin and I came back from ORANGES mixes in LA to try and sort the legal mess over management.}}</ref> In April 1984, the group learned that he had incurred them an outstanding [[Value-added tax in the United Kingdom|value-added taxes]] [VAT] bill{{sfn|Twomey|1992|p=137}} and that he had significantly mishandled their revenue stream.<ref name="Contrast1990"/> A lawsuit was filed by the band, while he counter-sued for "unpaid commission on royalties". Virgin were then "legally required to freeze royalty and advance payments and divert publishing income into a frozen deposit account."<ref name="Mojo1999"/> For the next decade, the entirety of the band's earnings would be invested in the continued litigation.<ref name="HuntPhaze" /> The group supported themselves mostly through short-term loans from Virgin and royalty payments derived from airplay.<ref name="Mojo1999"/> At one point, Moulding and Gregory were working at a car rental service for additional income.<ref name="O&LQuietus" /> Partridge was eventually left with "about £300 in the bank", he said, "which is really heavy when you've got a family and everyone thinks you're 'Mr Rich and Famous'."<ref name="HuntPhaze" /> A court-enforced [[gag order]] restricts the band from speaking publicly on the alleged improprieties.<ref name="Sailed2006" /> According to Partridge, Reid was "very naughty" and left the band with roughly £300,000 in unpaid VAT.<ref name="HuntPhaze" /> Music journalist Patrick Schabe elaborates:

{{blockquote|... what is known is that [Reid] inked a deal with Virgin that wound up working out primarily for Reid, secondarily for Virgin, and not at all for XTC. Throughout their first five years of existence, XTC never saw a penny of profits from either album sales or touring revenue. Reid, on the other hand, took out large loans from Virgin, borrowing against XTC's royalties, to the tune of millions of pounds by some estimates. Even after the band settled out of court with Reid, because of the terms of the contract, Virgin was able to hold XTC liable for the sum. Because of XTC's failure to tour, the likelihood of ever repaying Virgin dwindled further and further away. Over the course of a 20-year contract with Virgin Records, and after achieving gold and platinum status in album sales on a number of discs, XTC never saw any publishing royalties.<ref name="Sailed2006" />}}

===''Mummer'' and faltered popularity===

During the middle months of 1982, Partridge spent his time in convalescence and writing songs.<ref name="Mojo1999"/> He later surmised that relinquishing Valium inadvertently gave him a new sense of creative direction: "I was thinking clearer and wanted to know stuff. Life's big questions."<ref name="MagnetSkylarking">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.magnetmagazine.com/2016/03/28/magnet-classics-xtcs-skylarking/ |title=The Making of XTC's "Skylarking" |last=Amorosi |first=A.D. |date=28 March 2016 |magazine=[[Magnet (magazine)|Magnet]]|access-date=13 March 2017}}</ref> In the interim, Chambers moved to Australia and started a family. Feeling dismayed by Partridge's decision not to tour, he had to be persuaded to return to Swindon for the next album's rehearsals in September. At one rehearsal, Partridge recalled asking Chambers for "tiny, cyclical, nattering clay pots", which he replied sounded "a bit fucking nancified".<ref name="Mojo1999"/> The newly-wed Chambers soon left the band to be with his wife in Australia.<ref name="Mojo1999"/>

Drummer [[Pete Phipps]], formerly of [[the Glitter Band]], was quickly hired as a session musician to continue the recording sessions—XTC would never again employ a permanent drummer after Chambers' departure. In the meantime, Virgin released a greatest hits compilation, ''[[Waxworks: Some Singles 1977–1982]]'', to underwhelming sales. The group's new material was rejected by Virgin executive Jeremy Lascelles, who suggested that they write something more commercial. Partridge remembered, "He asked me to write something a bit more like The Police, with more international flavour, more basic appeal."<ref name="Mojo1999"/> Lascelles said that he had actually named [[Talking Heads]], not the Police: "Andy likes to portray us as the strict, stern schoolmasters, but we never wanted him to compromise at anything we thought he was good at. Here were very talented songwriters – surely, surely, surely they can come up with that elusive thing that is a hit single. That was our psyche."<ref name="Mojo1999"/>

After some remixing and additional songs at Virgin's behest, ''[[Mummer (album)|Mummer]]'', the first product of the studio-bound XTC, appeared in August 1983.<ref name="Mojo1999"/> Virgin did little to promote the album and delayed its release by several months.<ref name="Mojo1999"/> At number 58, it was their lowest-charting album to date.<ref name="OCC" /> The one single that did chart, "[[Love on a Farmboy's Wages]]", did find significant airplay on BBC Radio 1.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Stafford |first1=Bob |title=Oranges & Lemons |magazine=[[Melody Maker]] |date=1989 }}</ref> It was the first of a handful of XTC songs written over the years that reflected their poor financial state.<ref name="Dom2000" />

Virtually every contemporary review of ''Mummer'' accused the band of falling out of touch with the contemporary music climate.{{sfn|Twomey|1992|p=134}} Journalist Serene Dominic retrospectively wrote that the album was seen as "something of a disappointment at the time of release ... [It was] devoid of silly songs like 'Sgt. Rock' that had heretofore been the band's stock-in-trade and didn't rock out until the last song, 'Funk Pop a Roll.' ... ''Mummer'' signaled a strange rebirth for XTC."<ref name="Dom2000" /> Moulding thought that "when we came back from America after our aborted tour of 1982 ... people like [[Spandau Ballet]] had moved onto the scene; new groups were coming up and there was no place for us."<ref name="RB2002"/>{{refn|group=nb|When asked for a favourite song by Spandau Ballet, Partridge responded: "I used to see them on TV and I wanted to kick in the set.

XTC released the 1983 holiday single "[[Thanks for Christmas]]" under the pseudonym Three Wise Men. It was produced by [[David Lord (producer)|David Lord]], owner of Crescent Studios in Bath, and they subsequently negotiated a deal that allowed them to work as much as they wanted on their next album at his studio. Some of the album was recorded using a [[Linn LM-1|Linn LM-1 Drum Computer]], and extensive time was spent on its programming.<ref name="Mojo1999"/> Partridge envisioned the work as "industrial pop" inspired by Swindon, a "railway town".<ref name="Filter2007"/> The result, ''[[The Big Express]]'', returned the group to a brighter and uptempo sound marked by [[studio experimentation]] and denser arrangements, setting a template that they would develop on subsequent albums.<ref name="AMbigexp">{{cite web|last1=Woodstra|first1=Chris|title=The Big Express|website=AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-big-express-mw0000201518|access-date=20 September 2017}}</ref> He jokingly referred to some parts of the album as the only time the group were befallen with stereotypical 1980s-style production.<ref name="Filter2007">{{cite journal |last1=Pierson |first1=Pat |title=Permanent Bliss: The Immutable Pleasures of XTC |journal=[[Filter (magazine)|Filter]]|date=September 2007 }}</ref> It was released in October 1984, reaching a higher chart position than ''Mummer'',<ref name="XTCAMbio"/> but was "virtually ignored" by critics.<ref name="AMbigexp"/> Virgin invested £33,000 into the music video for "[[All You Pretty Girls]]" to little effect.<ref name="Mojo1999"/> The band were charged for the sum.<ref>{{cite tweet |user=xtcfans |last=Partridge |first=Andy |author-link=Andy Partridge |date=29 January 2019|number=1090255526066176001|title=WC-"Virgin invested £33,000 into the music video for "All You Pretty Girls" to little effect."

When Gregory joined the band in 1979, Partridge learned that they both shared a longtime enthusiasm for 1960s [[psychedelic music]].

Partridge and Leckie were dismissed due to conflicts related to their religious affiliations or lack thereof (O'Hara was a devout Catholic). Partridge was feeling inspired by [[Nick Nicely]]'s 1982 psychedelic single "Hilly Fields 1892", and devised a recording project to fill the newfound gap in his schedule.<ref name="Mojo1999" /> The rules were as follows: songs must follow the conventions of 1967 and 1968 psychedelia; no more than two takes allowed; use vintage equipment wherever possible. After receiving a £5,000 advance from a skeptical Virgin Records, the group devoted two weeks to the sessions.{{sfn|Rachel|2014|p=203}}

Calling themselves "[[the Dukes of Stratosphear]]", the spin-off group consisted of Partridge and Moulding with Dave and his drummer brother Ian. Each adopted a pseudonym: Sir John Johns, The Red Curtain, Lord Cornelius Plum and E.I.E.I. Owen. At the sessions, the band dressed themselves in [[Paisley (design)|Paisley]] outfits and lit scented candles.<ref name="Mojo1999"/> With "nothing to live up to" as the Dukes, Partridge looked back on the project as the "most fun we ever had in the studio ... We never knew if it would sell ... We could never [subvert everybody's expectations] with XTC, as there was too much money involved and we were expected to be mentally honest and 'real.' Too much financial pressure."<ref name="MagnetSkylarking" /> Released on [[April Fools' Day]] 1985, the album was presented as a long-lost collection of recordings by a late 1960s group.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Erlewine |first1=Stephen Thomas |author-link1=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |title=25 O'Clock |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/25-oclock-mw0000811566 |website=AllMusic|access-date=20 September 2017}}</ref> When asked about the album in interviews, XTC initially denied having any involvement.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Brelhan |first1=Tom |title=XTC to Reissue Dukes of Stratosphear Side Project |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/34690-xtc-to-reissue-dukes-of-stratosphear-side-project/ |website=Pitchfork |date=25 February 2009|access-date=20 September 2017}}</ref> In England, the six-track [[mini-album]] sold twice as many copies as ''The Big Express'', even before the Dukes' identity was made public.

During a routine meeting in early 1986, Virgin executives threatened to drop the band from the label if their next album failed to sell more than 70,000 units.<ref name="Mojo1999"/> One reason why the group was not selling enough records, Virgin reportedly concluded, was that they sounded "too English".<ref name="Keyboard87">{{cite journal |last1=Greenwald |first1=Ted |title=XTC's Reluctant Keyboardist Reveals Rundgren's Production Style |journal=[[Keyboard (magazine)|Keyboard]] |date=November 1987 }}</ref> The label forced the group to work with one of their selected American producers.

In January 1986, Partridge and Moulding mailed Rundgren a collection of more than 20 demo tapes they had stockpiled in advance.{{sfn|Myers|2010|p=257}} Compared to previous XTC albums, much of the material contrasted significantly with its mellower feel, lush arrangements, and "flowery" aesthetic.<ref name="MagnetSkylarking" /> Rundgren responded with the idea of a [[concept album]] to bridge "Colin's 'pastoral' tunes and subject matter and Andy's 'pop anthems' and sly poetry. ...

Using this framework, I [Rundgren] came up with a sequence of songs and a justification for their placement and brought it to the band."{{sfn|Myers|2010|pp=257–258}}

''[[Skylarking]]'' spent one week on the UK album charts, reaching number 90 in November 1986, two weeks after its release.<ref name="OCC"/> Moulding's "[[Grass (XTC song)|Grass]]" was chosen as lead single. It was issued exclusively in the UK with the B-side "[[Dear God (XTC song)|Dear God]]", an outtake. "Dear God" became so popular with American [[college radio]] stations who imported the record that [[Geffen Records]] (XTC's US distributor) recalled and re-pressed ''Skylarking'' with the track included.<ref name="Mojo1999"/> Controversy also broke out over the song's anti-religious lyrics, which inspired some violent incidents. In Florida, a radio station received a bomb threat, and in New York, a student forced their school to play the song over its public-address system by holding a faculty member at knife-point. Nonetheless, the commercial success of "Dear God" propelled ''Skylarking'' to sell more than 250,000 units, and it raised the band's profile among American college youth.<ref name="Mojo1999"/> In the US, the album spent 29 weeks on the ''Billboard 200'' and reached its peak position of number 70 in June 1987.<ref name="Billboard200">{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/277881/xtc/chart?f=305 |title=Billboard 200: XTC |date=2017 |work=Billboard |access-date=27 February 2017 }}</ref>  The music video for "Dear God" received the 1987 ''Billboard'' Best Video award and was also nominated for three categories at the [[MTV Video Music Awards]].<ref name="Schabe">{{cite web|last1=Schabe|first1=Patrick|title=XTC: A Coat of Many Cupboards|url=https://www.popmatters.com/xtc-coat-2496118960.html|website=PopMatters|date=5 May 2002}}</ref> ''Skylarking'' ultimately became XTC's best-known album<ref name="DahlenFuzzy">{{cite web|last1=Dahlen|first1=Chris|title=Andy Partridge – Fuzzy Warbles Collector's Album|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9785-fuzzy-warbles-collectors-album/|website=Pitchfork|date=19 January 2007|access-date=20 September 2017}}</ref> and is generally regarded as their finest work.<ref name="Skylarking diffuser"/>

Partridge was reluctant to make another Dukes album, but to appease requests from his bandmates and Virgin Records, ''[[Psonic Psunspot]]'' (1987) was recorded. This time, 10 songs and a £10,000 budget was supplied, while John Leckie returned as producer.<ref name="Mojo1999"/> Once again, the Dukes' record outsold XTC's previous album in the UK (''Skylarking'' in this case). Partridge felt it was "a bit upsetting to think that people preferred these pretend personalities to our own personalities ... But I don't mind because we have turned into the Dukes slowly over the years."<ref name="HuntPhaze"/> Likewise, Moulding felt that the "psychedelic element was being more ingratiated into the pie" since ''25 O'Clock''.<ref name="MagnetSkylarking" /> When issued on CD, ''Psonic Psunspot'' was combined with ''25 O'Clock'' and given the title ''[[Chips from the Chocolate Fireball]]'' (1987).<ref name="XTCAMbio"/>

For their next album ''[[Oranges & Lemons (album)|Oranges & Lemons]]'', XTC traveled to Los Angeles to make use of a cheap studio rate arranged by [[Paul Fox (record producer)|Paul Fox]], who was recruited by the band for his first production gig.<ref name="Contrast1990" /> Another reason for recording in the US with an American producer, said Gregory, was that "America was our biggest market".<ref name="Filter2007"/> [[Mr. Mister]] (and later longtime [[King Crimson]]) member [[Pat Mastelotto]] was the drummer for the entire album. The album was released in February 1989 with music that was in a similar psychedelic vein as the Dukes.<ref name="XTCAMbio"/>  In a retrospective review, ''[[The Quietus]]''{{'}} Nick Reed notes: "Nearly every instrument is mixed to the forefront; it's too well-arranged to be cacophonous, but there's a degree of sensory overload, especially given the band's newfound tendency to blast synthesizers in our faces. ... whether or not this album holds up for you depends on how much you like the band's boisterous side."<ref name="O&LQuietus"/> It became the highest album they had in the charts since 1982's ''English Settlement'', rising to number 28 in the UK<ref name="OCC" /> and number 44 in the US.<ref name="Billboard200" /> Additionally, it combined with ''Skylarking'' for the group's best-selling albums to date.<ref name="agony1992"/>  "[[Mayor of Simpleton]]" reached number 46 in the UK<ref name="O&LQuietus"/> and number 72 in the US, making it their only American single to chart.<ref name="XTCAMbio"/>

To support the album, XTC embarked on an acoustic-guitar American radio tour that lasted for two weeks in May.<ref name="Mojo1999" /> The shows were carried out without financial compensation for the band.<ref>{{cite tweet |user=xtcfans |last=Partridge |first=Andy |author-link=Andy Partridge |date=29 January 2019|number=1090257969634103296|title=WC-Re acoustic EU tour...|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190507134004/https:/twitter.com/xtcfans/status/1090257969634103296|archive-date=7 May 2019}}</ref> Gregory commented that it was an "interesting" style of promotion, but "incredibly hard work", as the band performed at about four radio stations a day for three weeks: "We also did a live acoustic set for MTV in front of an audience which worried Andy a bit but he got through it."<ref name="Ramon"/> This inspired the network to invite more artists to perform stripped-down sets, calling the series "[[MTV Unplugged|unplugged]]".<ref name="Mojo1999" /> XTC's performance of "[[King for a Day (XTC song)|King for a Day]]" on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' marked the first time the group played in front of a live audience in seven years.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gibbs|first1=Ryan|title=Favorite Letterman Music Moments|url=https://www.theyoungfolks.com/music/56185/favorite-letterman-music-moments/|website=[[The Young Folks]]|date=19 May 2015|access-date=20 September 2017}}</ref> A similar acoustic tour was planned for Europe, but cancelled when Partridge discovered that the Paris date would be broadcast from a sold-out 5,000 seater venue.<ref name="RB2002"/> After an unsuccessful attempt was made to coax Partridge back into regular touring,<ref name="Mojo1999" /> they took a short break.

[[Tarquin Gotch]], who served as XTC's manager for a short time, helped the band reach a legal settlement with Ian Reid in 1989.<ref name="Mojo1999" /> However, they were again left with a six-figure debt. Virgin Records advanced the group enough money to cover their debt in exchange for the promise of four additional albums.<ref name="Filter2007"/> Having written more than two dozen songs by 1991, some difficulties prolonged the start of recording sessions for the next album.

==1993–present: Legal entanglement, return and breakup==
===Strike period===
In 1993, Partridge conceived XTC's next project to be an album of [[bubblegum pop]] songs disguising itself as a retrospective compilation featuring 12 different groups from the early 1970s. The lyrics were also heavily sexual, with song titles such as "Lolly (Suck It and See)" and "Visit to the Doctor". Partridge recalled playing some demos for Virgin agents, and compared their reaction to the "[[Springtime for Hitler]]" scene from the 1967 film ''[[The Producers (1967 film)|The Producers]]''. The label rejected his idea.<ref name="Dom2000" /> Virgin denied Partridge's requests to renegotiate or revoke XTC's contract.<ref name="Mojo1999" /> Paul Kinder believed that the label and the group were "poles apart" and that "the contract was so old it got to the point where Andy wanted the moon and Virgin weren't prepared to give it him."<ref name="Mojo1999" />

Whatever new music the band recorded would have been automatically owned by Virgin, and so the band enacted [[strike action]] against the label.<ref name="Dom2000" /> [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[George Michael]] also went on a strike against their respective labels that was heavily publicized at about the same time. XTC's strike, however, received little press.<ref name="Sailed2006" /><ref>{{cite web|url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4707495/And-the-band-did-not-play-on.html|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160226074010/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4707495/And-the-band-did-not-play-on.html|url-status =dead|archive-date =26 February 2016|title =And the band did not play on|website =The Daily Telegraph|first =David|last =Gritten|date =8 February 1997}}</ref> In the meantime, Partridge produced [[Martin Newell (musician)|Martin Newell]]'s 1993 album ''[[The Greatest Living Englishman]]''<ref>{{cite web|last1=Unterberger|first1=Richie|author-link1=Richie Unterberger|title=The Greatest Living Englishman|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-greatest-living-englishman-mw0000535804|website=AllMusic|access-date=20 September 2017}}</ref> and early sessions for [[Blur (band)|Blur's]] [[Modern Life Is Rubbish|second album]]. "I thought I did sterling work. ...

In 1997 (also reported as in late 1994<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bookman |first1=Dave |title=Virgins No More |journal=Eye Weekly|date=15 December 1994 |quote=After a 17-year association, pop perfectionists XTC have ended their relationship with Virgin Records.}}</ref>), XTC found themselves freed from financial debt and from Virgin after "making some heavy concessions".

By late 1997, Partridge and Moulding had amassed a large stockpile of material.<ref name="muzik2000"/>  The former's songs were an elaboration on the more orchestral style he developed with ''Nonsuch'' tracks "Omnibus", "[[Wrapped in Grey]]", and "Rook".<ref name="RB2002"/>  Moulding felt that "something a bit different" was appropriate for the band at this juncture, and shared Partridge's desire for a cohesive LP similar to soundtracks such as ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' and "stuff that Burt Bacharach wrote for various [films]".<ref name="muzik2000">{{cite web|last1=Tobin|first1=Alex|title=XTC Interview with Colin Moulding|url=http://www.kindamuzik.net/achtergrond/xtc/xtc/496/|website=Kinda Muzik|date=29 May 2000|access-date=20 September 2017}}</ref> Partridge thought the new songs were "some of the best stuff, if not the best stuff, ever. It's even more intensely passionate than before."<ref name="Mojo1999" />

The group elected to divide the album into two parts: one of rock songs, and the other of orchestral/acoustic songs augmented by a 40-piece symphony.<ref name="Chicago2000" /> They found a label, [[Cooking Vinyl]], and a producer, [[Haydn Bendall]], who had engineered XTC's debut EP back in 1977 and had significant experience in recording orchestras. [[Prairie Prince]], who drummed on ''Skylarking'', returned for the sessions. It soon became apparent that the band did not have the funds to record all the material they had.<ref name="Mojo1999" /> Gregory, Moulding, and Bendall wanted to reduce the project to one disc, but Partridge insisted on spreading it over two LPs.<ref name="Chicago2000" /> It was decided that they release one album with the orchestral portions ("volume 1") and leave the rock songs for its follow-up ("volume 2").<ref name="Mojo1999" /> A session was booked at Abbey Road, but the recording was rushed, lasting one day, and had to be edited over a three-month period.<ref name="Dom2000" />

Released in February 1999, ''[[Apple Venus Volume 1]]'' was met with critical acclaim and moderate sales.<ref name="Sailed2006" /> It had minimal promotion.<ref name="Mojo1999" /> Comparing the album to the group's earlier work, ''Pitchfork'' reviewer Zach Hooker wrote: "''Apple Venus'' finds them picking up pretty much where they left off.

XTC's principal songwriters were guitarist Andy Partridge and bassist Colin Moulding. Partridge, who wrote the majority of XTC's songs, was the group's frontman and de facto leader. He drove the band's image, designed many of their record sleeves, and handled most of their interviews.<ref name="Word04">{{cite magazine|last1=Paphides |first1=Peter |title=Senses Working Overtime |url=http://chalkhills.org/articles/Word200404.html |website=Word |date=April 2004|issue=14}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|He described himself as the band's "battery"<ref name="Word04"/> and expressed resentment "that the other three, inevitably, would go off sightseeing while muggins here would be needed for radio, TV and magazine interviews."<ref name="teamrock16" /> Moulding said he was "happy for him to do the talking."<ref name="Moulding00">{{cite web |last1=Bernhardt |first1=Todd |title=Working from the Inside: A conversation with Colin Moulding |url=http://chalkhills.org/articles/TBColin20000523.html |website=Chalkihlls |access-date=24 August 2019 |date=23 May 2000}}</ref>}} His involvement with XTC's record sleeves stemmed from his disappointment with the sleeve for the "Statue of Liberty" single, which depicted a poorly cropped photo of the statue and the XTC logo in red.{{sfn|Farmer|1998|p=88}} He was less successful in his attempts to involve himself in the band's music videos, as he said, the woman in charge of Virgin's video department rebuked all his ideas, some of which other groups later adopted in award-winning videos.{{sfn|Partridge|Bernhardt|2016}}

Partridge and Moulding did not write together. Of their partnership, Moulding stated in 1992: "There's a lot of freedom to do what each of us likes with the other's songs, however. ... Each person puts his little prints on them."<ref name="brenda"/> They did collaborate on arrangements, with "horn lines and harmonies, that sort of thing."<ref name="OF03"/> He also lent praise to Partridge as "a real ideas man, and I love good ideas.

Not megalomania.}}</ref>}}

Discussing Moulding's songs, Partridge said that few were included on XTC albums because Moulding was not a prolific writer.<ref name="RundgrenRadio-Andy"/> Gregory said that all of Moulding's proposed songs would be recorded to preserve democracy in the band, and "occasionally at the expense of some of Andy's often superior offerings. This didn't always go down well, either with Andy or the band, but Colin did have some killer melodies and a sweeter sound to his voice that made a welcome diversion when listening to an album as a whole."<ref name="Filter2007"/> Partridge opined that Moulding's songs initially "came out as weird imitations of what I was doing", but by the time of ''Drums and Wires'', "he really started to take off as a songwriter."<ref name="Contrast1990" /> He was more effused with Moulding's offerings for ''Skylarking'', which included the highest ratio of Moulding songs for any XTC album.{{sfn|Myers|2010|p=258}}  On Moulding's bass-playing, Partridge praised his "old-fashioned" tendency to match notes to the bass drum.<ref name="oversight"/>

In ''Song Stories'', Neville Farmer comments that Partridge "is the boss—erratic but willful [and] runs the band on instinct", while Moulding "is the voice of calm ... a foil to Andy's radical side."{{sfn|Farmer|1998|p=309}} Music journalist Peter Paphides felt that the songwriters' personalities "couldn't seem more different," with Moulding "phlegmatic, shy, and heartbreakingly pretty" and Partridge an "art-school dropout ... uptight, dominating and extrovert."<ref name="Word04" /> In Moulding's view, Partridge also typically acted as an "executive producer" for albums while frequently undermining the authority of the actual credited producer.{{sfn|Myers|2010|p=255}}{{refn|group=nb|Partridge commented: "There's a lot of, 'Andy must be awful in the studio' [written on the Internet]. I'm not, I'm mister fucking nice!"<ref name="teamrock16" /> He said that the only producers he ever had trouble with were Todd Rundgren on ''Skylarking'' and Gus Dudgeon on ''Nonsuch''.<ref name="RundgrenRadio-Andy" />}}  Their recording approaches differed in that Moulding sometimes preferred spontaneous or imperfect performances, whereas Partridge working method was to refine a song through repeated [[take]]s.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bernhardt |first1=Todd |last2=Moulding |first2=Colin |author-link2=Colin Moulding|title=Colin discusses 'The Meeting Place' |url=http://chalkhills.org/articles/XTCFans20090125.html |website=Chalkhills |date=26 January 2009}}</ref> The band occasionally took to the term "Andy-ness" to describe Partridge's studio indulgences.{{sfn|Twomey|1992|p=162}}{{refn|group=nb|Partridge thought of the band's producers as "a funnel through which I can talk to other members of the band ... They'll accept it coming from another person, but they won't accept it from a contemporary."<ref name="Chicago2000" /> }}  Despite this, they rarely found themselves encumbered by serious creative differences. In 1997, Moulding called one dispute over a ''Skylarking'' bass part the "only real argument" between him and Partridge in the band's history.{{sfn|Farmer|1998|p=194}}

====Andrews, Gregory and drummers====

Barry Andrews, XTC's keyboard player for their first two albums, emerged as a third solo songwriter on the group's second album ''Go 2''. However, he left the band shortly thereafter.<ref name="Mojo1999" /> His replacement, guitarist Dave Gregory, did not contribute songs, but was the only one in the band who could [[full score|score]] music, and frequently contributed orchestral arrangements.{{sfn|Farmer|1998|p=61}} Moulding said that when Andrews was in the band, Partridge had "no kind of foil" to work with, as both musicians were drawn to dissonant harmonies: "[Andy] used to like the real kind of angular, spiky, upward-thrusting guitar ... if one is angular, the other has to kind of straighten him out ... So when Dave came in, and was a much straighter player, it seemed to make more sense, I think."<ref name="LBAT09"/> Starting in 1982, Gregory extended his talents to keyboards as well,<ref name="Mojo1999" /> since Partridge and Moulding were not adept with the instrument.{{sfn|Farmer|1998|p=309}}

Gregory never presented a completed idea for a song to the band partly because he felt intimidated by Partridge's scrutiny.{{sfn|Farmer|1998|p=309}}{{refn|group=nb|During the sessions for ''Drums and Wires'' or ''Black Sea'', Gregory did present an original song, but it was rejected on the grounds that it was too derivative of [[Steely Dan]].<ref>{{cite tweet |user=xtcfans |last=Partridge |first=Andy |author-link=Andy Partridge |date=29 January 2019|number=1090264471774232581|title=WC-Re Dave songwriting, "He never presented a completed idea for a song to the band, partly because he felt intimidated by Partridge's scrutiny." He did bring up a song, either at DRUMS or SEA sessions. The rest of the band thought it too derivative of Steely Dan,so didn't pursue}}</ref>}} Since he "couldn't continue grinding out old blues clichés and [[power chord]]s," he decided to "think more in terms of the songs as the masters and the instruments as the servants."<ref name="Filter2007" /> Discussing Gregory's contributions to the group, Farmer writes of "a precision and correctness that carries through from his prerehearsal of guitar solos to ... his encyclopedic knowledge of guitars and who-played-what-on-which-instrument-with-which-amplifier-in-which-studio-on-which-record-under-the-influence-of-what-star-sign-or-guru-or-drug."{{sfn|Farmer|1998|p=309}}

Terry Chambers was the band's original drummer. He was described by Partridge as "the [drummer] that's been the most primitive, but probably the most thrilling for inventiveness, because he would blunder into [different ideas]."<ref name="oversight">{{cite web |last1=Bernhardt |first1=Todd |title=Andy Partridge: Providing XTC's Rhythmic Oversight |url=http://chalkhills.org/articles/TBAndy19980517.html |website=Chalkhills |access-date=25 August 2019 |date=17 May 1998}}</ref> One of his characteristic techniques was the use of [[cymbal choke|hi-hat chokes]].<ref name="LBAT09" /> Following his departure in 1983, the group employed a succession of session drummers for their studio recordings.<ref name="brenda"/> This included [[Pete Phipps]] (''Mummer'' and ''The Big Express''), [[Prairie Prince]] (''Skylarking'' and ''Apple Venus''), [[Pat Mastelotto]] (''Oranges & Lemons''), and [[Dave Mattacks]] (''Nonsuch'').{{sfn|Farmer|1998}} [[Drum machine]]s also began to be incorporated into the group's sound.<ref name="oversight"/> None of the studio drummers were accepted as official members of the band.

XTC were not initially public with their influences due to the punk scene's anathema toward stating one's influences.{{sfn|Farmer|1998|p=7}} ''Pitchfork'' writer Chris Dahlen characterised the band's original sound as punk meets "[[Buddy Holly]]-on-amphetamines ... danceable enough for the crowds at the clubs, and suspiciously poppy thanks to the catchy hooks and their trademark verse-chorus-verse-chorus-''explode'' pattern."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dahlen|first1=Chris|title=Go 2 / English Settlement / Black Sea|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8833-go-2-black-sea-english-settlement/|website=Pitchfork.com|date=9 July 2002|access-date=20 September 2017}}</ref>  Partridge said that he adopted a vocal style out of "fear that we weren't going to make another record ... and people weren't going to be left with any impression of the singer". He described it as a "walrus" or "seal bark" that amalgamated Buddy Holly's "hiccup", [[Elvis Presley]]'s vibrato, and "the howled mannerisms of [[Steve Harley]]."{{sfn|Farmer|1998|p=22}}  In reference to the energy of the band's performances (which drew comparisons with [[Talking Heads]]{{sfn|DeRogatis|2003|p=341}}), Partridge remembered how they "used to fucking kill ourselves. I think it was fear. It was fear manifested in ludicrously high energy music. It was like 1000% whaaahh! All of the songs were run together and it was really uptempo stuff."<ref name="Contrast1990" /> According to Moulding, "any kinship [XTC had] with punk" was gone after 1979's [[Motown]]-influenced "Life Begins at the Hop".{{sfn|Farmer|1998|p=68}}

Of his guitar technique, Partridge said that it evolved from his desire to be a drummer, to "chop and slash and try to work between what the drums were doing, a) so I could be heard, and b) because I liked the funk and I liked working the holes that the drums left."<ref name="oversight"/> He was particularly influenced by [[John French (musician)|John French]], the drummer for Captain Beefheart's Magic Band, although he disliked that the drummer's [[groove (music)|groove]] would change every few bars.<ref name="oversight"/> Gregory attributed XTC's unorthodox drum patterns to Partridge's affinity for dub and reggae; "He's got a great innate sense of rhythm.

==Lyricism and English culture==
{{Quote box
| quote =Among the scores of songs Partridge wrote for XTC are perfect examples of a very English genre: rock music uprooted from the glamour and dazzle of the city, and recast as the soundtrack to life in suburbs, small towns, and the kind of places – like Swindon – that may be more sizeable, but are still held up as bywords for broken hopes and limited horizons.

XTC are noted for their "Englishness". Partridge denied that this was conscious on his part: "I don't try to be English. I guess because I am English, it comes out English. But I don't sit down and think, "Cor blimey, can I put a union jack and a beefeater's outfit on, Mary?"<ref name="Lyrical">{{cite web |last1=Bernhardt |first1=Todd |last2=Partridge |first2=Andy |title=The Lyrical Andy Partridge |url=http://chalkhills.org/articles/XTCFans20060324.html |website=Chalkhills |access-date=18 October 2018 |date=24 March 2006}}</ref> British music critic [[John Harris (critic)|John Harris]] identified Partridge's XTC compositions as within the same "lineage" of rural English songwriting invented by Ray Davies of the Kinks, and followed by [[the Jam]], [[the Specials]], "scores of half-forgotten punk and new wave bands," [[the Smiths]] and mid 1990s [[Britpop]].<ref name="Harris2010"/> In Partridge's opinion, the band "never got beyond Swindon."{{sfn|Farmer|1998|pp=164–165}}{{refn|group=nb|Songs inspired by the town or its people included "Life Begins at the Hop", "Wait Till Your Boat Goes Down", "[[Ball and Chain (XTC song)|Ball and Chain]]", "The Everyday Story of Smalltown", "I Remember the Sun", "Red Brick Dream", "Grass", "[[The Meeting Place (song)|The Meeting Place]]", and "Boarded Up".{{sfn|Farmer|1998|pp=67, 127, 164–165, 170, 172, 174, 188–189, 292}}}} He also felt that XTC being described as "pastoral" was a compliment: "'Pastoral' to me means being more in touch with the country than the city, which I think we are. London gives me the willies."<ref name="George83"/> Lyrically, he cited Ray Davies, John Lennon, and Paul McCartney as his biggest influences.<ref name="Lyrical"/>

According to biographer Neville Farmer, Partridge and Moulding tended to write about "more general aspects of their lives and their attitudes".{{sfn|Farmer|1998|p=306}} Farmer added that "Colin nor Andy handle political or religious matters with subtlety. If they have an idea about something, they say it straightforwardly. They are no more embarrassed about their view on the world than Andy is about his sex life. That makes them easy targets for criticism."{{sfn|Farmer|1998|p=307}} For Partridge, other popular subject matter included financial shortage, factory work, [[comic book]] characters, seafaring, war, and ancient rituals.{{sfn|Farmer|1998|pp=106, 122}} He described himself as an [[atheist]] and said he did not become interested in politics until circa 1979, when he voted for [[Margaret Thatcher]] "purely because she was a woman. I was that naive. Now I'm very [[leftism|left]]."<ref name="heavyload"/>

==Recognition and influence==
Writing for AllMusic, music critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] recognises the group thusly:
{{blockquote|XTC was one of the smartest – and catchiest – British pop bands to emerge from the punk and new wave explosion of the late '70s. ... While popular success has eluded them in both Britain and America, the group has developed a devoted cult following in both countries that remains loyal over two decades after their first records. ... XTC's lack of commercial success isn't because their music isn't accessible – their bright, occasionally melancholy, melodies flow with more grace than most bands – it has more to do with the group constantly being out of step with the times. However, the band has left behind a remarkably rich and varied series of albums that make a convincing argument that XTC is the great lost pop band.<ref name="XTCAMbio">{{cite web|first=Stephen Thomas|last=Erlewine|author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/xtc-mn0000678339/biography |title=XTC |website=AllMusic |access-date=27 December 2017}}</ref>
