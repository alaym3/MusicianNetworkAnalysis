They split in 2002.

==History==
The band was formed in Cardiff in 1992 by singer-songwriter [[Anthony Reynolds]] and guitarist Matthew Scott. The pair moved to London in 1993, where they recruited Richard Adderley (guitar), Audrey Morse (violin), [[Paddy Pulzer|Patrick Pulzer]] (drums), Colin Williams (bass) and George Wright (keyboards).<ref name="Larkin90">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=202}}</ref>

They signed to [[Too Pure]] in 1995, with their first release for the label being the limited-edition "Kid Stardust" single (a tribute to [[Charles Bukowski]]) in November that year. Their debut album, ''Pioneer Soundtracks'', was released in June 1996.<ref name="Larkin90"/>

Produced by Peter Walsh, the album garnered excellent reviews,<ref name="Melody Maker">[[Allan Jones (editor)|Jones, Allan]]. "The Mourning After". ''[[Melody Maker]]''. 22 June 1996.</ref><ref name="Guardian">[[Ian Penman|Penman, Ian]]. "CD of the Week: Jack". ''[[The Guardian]]''. 28 June 1996.</ref> but despite considerable touring both in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Europe]], the three initial singles drawn from the album - "Wintercomessummer", "White Jazz", and "Biography Of A First Son" - failed to pick up any serious airplay and as a result sales were disappointing.

Morse had left the band a year after recording their debut. She was replaced by Lucy Wilkins in summer 1996. Wilkins was in turn replaced by Ruth Gottlieb the following year.

Following a renegotiation of their contract with Too Pure, they returned to the studio with Divine Comedy producer [[Darren Allison]] in autumn 1997 to work on their second album.

''[[The Jazz Age (Jack album)|The Jazz Age]]'' was released in August 1998.<ref name="Larkin90"/> Despite more excellent reviews<ref name="Uncut Review">Jones, Allan. "Tenement Symphonies". ''Uncut''. August 1998.</ref><ref name="Guardian 2">[[David Bennun|Bennun, David]]. "Bohemian Rhapsodies". ''The Guardian''. 14 August 1998.</ref> and further European touring, the two singles from the album, "Lolita Elle" and "Steamin’" received little airplay and sales were once again disappointing.<ref name="Larkin90"/>

A mooted follow-up album, ''An Anatomy Of Melancholy'', was abandoned after the band was dropped by Too Pure and both Adderley and Gottlieb left the band.

A five-track mini-album, ''La Belle et la Discotheque'', produced by former [[Cocteau Twins]] bassist [[Simon Raymonde]], was released in September 2000. Although reviews were once again excellent, sales were low - although two tracks, "Sometimes" and "Disco-Cafe-Society" were playlisted on Spanish national radio. By this time Williams, Wright and Pulzer had the left the band and Scott and Reynolds elected to continue as a duo.

A final album, ''The End Of The Way It's Always Been'' was released in April 2002. The group disbanded later that year after an extensive European tour, including an appearance at the [[Festival Internacional de Benicàssim|Benicàssim festival]]. They played their final concert in Cardiff in November.

Pulzer and Adderley later resurfaced as members of [[The Boyfriends (UK band)|The Boyfriends]].

''Pioneer Soundtracks'' was reissued in a belated 'Tenth Anniversary Edition' on the Spinney label in March 2007, with an additional CD of alternative versions, B-sides and live tracks.
