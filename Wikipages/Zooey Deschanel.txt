==Acting career==
{{update section|date=February 2021}}

===1999–2002: Early acting credits===
Deschanel had a guest appearance on the television series ''[[Veronica's Closet]]'' in 1998 and made her film debut in [[Lawrence Kasdan]]'s comedy ''[[Mumford (film)|Mumford]]'' (1999), revolving around the neurotic residents in a small town and co-starring [[Hope Davis]], [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]], [[Alfre Woodard]] and [[Mary McDonnell]]. Also in 1999, she appeared (non-singing) in the music video for [[The Offspring]]'s single "[[She's Got Issues]]". Deschanel co-starred in [[Cameron Crowe]]'s semi-autobiographical ''[[Almost Famous]]'' (2000), where she played Anita Miller, the rebellious older sister of a teenage journalist. Despite a modest box office response, the film received critical praise,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/almost_famous/ | title = Almost Famous&nbsp;— Movie Reviews, Trailers, Pictures&nbsp;— Rotten Tomatoes | publisher = Rotten Tomatoes<! | access-date = July 17, 2009}}</ref> winning the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Film – Musical or Comedy]]. Deschanel appeared in the independent drama ''[[Manic (2001 film)|Manic]]'' (2001), as the love interest of a troubled teen ([[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]]). The film was screened at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] and received a limited theatrical release. ''[[The New York Times]]'' found Deschanel to be "particularly spontaneous, unaffected and emotionally direct" in her role.<ref>{{Cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9501E6D8173DF936A15757C0A9659C8B63 | title = Movie Review – 'Manic' | last = Kehr | first = Dave | date = April 25, 2003 | newspaper = The New York Times | language = en|access-date=April 9, 2017}}</ref>

Following early notice, Deschanel took on supporting parts in four feature films released throughout 2002: [[Big Trouble (2002 film)|''Big Trouble'']], ''[[The New Guy]]'', ''[[The Good Girl]]'', and ''[[Abandon (2002 film)|Abandon]]''. In the comedy ''Big Trouble'', with [[Tim Allen]] and [[Rene Russo]], she played the daughter of a devoted and reluctant woman, and in the teen comedy ''The New Guy'', starred as a guitar player in a band. Deschanel portrayed a cynical, plain-spoken young woman working in a [[big-box store]] in the black dramedy ''The Good Girl'', opposite [[Jennifer Aniston]] and [[Jake Gyllenhaal]]. The psychological thriller ''Abandon'' saw her play the roommate of a woman involved in her boyfriend's disappearance. Deschanel also made a one-episode appearance in ''[[Frasier]]'', as an out-of-control young woman. ''The New York Times'' reported that Deschanel was "one of Hollywood's most sought-after young stars",<ref name="nite"/> in 2002, and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote in early 2003 that Deschanel had become a recognizable [[typecasting (acting)|type]], due to "her deadpan, sardonic and scene-stealing [film] performances" as the protagonist's best friend.<ref name="lat"/> Deschanel objected to her typecasting, arguing, "A lot of these roles are just a formula idea of somebody's best friend, and it's like, I don't even have that many friends. In high school, I stayed home all the time, so I don't know how I'm everybody's best friend now."<ref name="lat"/>

===2003–2010: Breakthrough===
Deschanel obtained her first leading film role debut in the independent drama ''[[All the Real Girls]]'' (2003) as Noel, a sexually curious 18-year-old [[virgin]] who has a life-changing romance with an aimless 22-year-old. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and was an arthouse success. Her performance received wide critical acclaim,<ref name="lat"/> and ''Variety'' remarked: "Performances are all credible and naturalistic, but standing out from the rest is Deschanel's work, which evinces an impressively direct connection to her character's emotions. The actress does a wonderful job presenting a young woman who is trying, with varying degrees of success, to give voice to all sorts of things she has never felt or expressed before".<ref>{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2003/film/reviews/all-the-real-girls-1200543799/ | title = All the Real Girls | first = Todd | last = McCarthy | date = January 29, 2003}}</ref> She received an [[Independent Spirit Award]] nomination for [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]].<ref>{{cite web | title = 2004 Best Female Lead: Zooey Deschanel – Actor – All the Real Girls | url = http://www.spiritawards.com/history-results | publisher = Spirit Awards | access-date = April 29, 2014 |url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131212000547/http://www.spiritawards.com/history-results | archive-date = December 12, 2013}}</ref> Also in 2003, Deschanel starred opposite [[Will Ferrell]] in the Christmas comedy ''[[Elf (film)|Elf]]'' as a deadpan department store worker and the love interest of a man raised by Santa's elves.<ref>{{cite web | last = Schwartz | first = Missy | url = https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1225341,00.html | title = ''Talledega Nights'' is a return to the top for Will Ferrell1 &#124; Movies | work = Entertainment Weekly | date = August 18, 2006 | access-date = July 17, 2009}}</ref> Reviewers found the film to be a "spirited, good-natured family comedy" as part of an overall positive critical response;<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/elf | title = Elf (2003) | via = rottentomatoes.com}}</ref> and, budgeted at US$33&nbsp;million, ''Elf'' made US$220.4&nbsp;million worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=elf.htm | title = Elf (2003) – Box Office Mojo | website = boxofficemojo.com}}</ref>
