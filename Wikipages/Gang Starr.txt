==Career==

===Original & second group lineups===
The original Gang Starr group was founded in [[Morehouse College]] by three friends from [[Boston, Massachusetts]]: Guru (then known as MC Keithy E.) who was planned to be a rapper/singer, [[Big Shug]] as the main MC and DJ Suave D (Shug's younger brother Dana) as their DJ. After Shug was imprisoned, Suave D quit the group, leaving Guru to enlist the services of MC Damo D-Ski and DJ 1, 2 B-Down (also known as Mike Dee)<ref>{{Cite web|date=2011-01-25|title=DJ Premier: Through the Test of Time|url=https://hypebeast.com/2011/1/dj-premier-through-the-test-of-time|access-date=2021-08-03|website=HYPEBEAST}}</ref> with various [[record producer|producers]], such as [[Donald D]], J.V. Johnson or [[The 45 King]] helping out. Their earliest recordings were in 1986 where they made various demos.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Mass Appeal Of Gang Starr |first=Oliver |last=Wang |publisher=NPR |date=21 April 2010 |access-date=28 December 2018 |url=https://www.npr.org/2010/04/21/126168702/the-mass-appeal-of-gang-starr |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229031824/https://www.npr.org/2010/04/21/126168702/the-mass-appeal-of-gang-starr |archive-date=29 December 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1987 and 1988, Gang Starr released three 12" vinyl singles on [[Wild Pitch Records]].

===Breakup and partnering with DJ Premier===
[[File:Gangstarr-09.jpg|thumbnail|right|Gang Starr performing in Hamburg in 1999]]
In 1989, the group split for the second time and the only member willing to continue under the name was Guru. He got in touch with [[Houston, Texas]] native [[DJ Premier]] (then known as Waxmaster C) who sent him a beat tape, which Guru liked. He invited DJ Premier to join Gang Starr, relocate with him to [[Brooklyn]] and in that same year they released their first single "Words I Manifest" along with the album ''[[No More Mr. Nice Guy (Gang Starr album)|No More Mr. Nice Guy]]'' (1989).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> In 1990, the group was signed to the Chrysalis record label by then A&R director Duff Marlowe, a former DJ and ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' rap music critic. The label offered Guru and Premier unlimited artistic license and major-label distribution worldwide, a platform the group used to become one of the most influential hip hop acts of that decade. During their career Gang Starr helped pioneer the New York City [[hardcore hip hop]] sound. The Gang Starr catalog, especially ''[[Step in the Arena]]'' (1991), ''[[Daily Operation]]'' (1992), ''[[Hard to Earn]]'' (1994) and ''[[Moment of Truth (Gang Starr album)|Moment of Truth]]'' (1998) are well respected among underground rap fans and critics. Their track "Jazz Thing" was featured on the [[soundtrack]] to [[Spike Lee]]'s film ''[[Mo' Better Blues]]''.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Gang Starr provided a track, "Battle", for the sound track of the 2002 movie ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]''.

After several albums and tours, in late 2002 DJ Premier left Europe to go back to the United States. Once again Guru was faced with continuing alone and became involved in a European tour in 2003–04 with an alternate DJ. In 2006, Guru indicated in several interviews that Gang Starr had reached its end.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allhiphop.com/features/?ID=1426|title=Guru & Solar: Group Therapy|author=Paine|website=AllHipHop.com|date=2006-06-13|access-date=2010-04-03|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060613001247/http://www.allhiphop.com/features/?ID=1426 |archive-date = 2006-06-13}}</ref>

===Guru's death===
In February 2010, Guru suffered a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]], went into a coma, and died on April 19, 2010. [[DJ Solar]], a long-time collaborator of Guru, said Guru chose not to go public with the diagnosis of [[myeloma]] that was made in 2000.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/Music/04/20/rapper.guru.dies/index.html |title=Rapper Guru dies after battle with cancer |publisher=cnn.com |date=2010-04-20 |access-date=2010-04-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423075748/http://www.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/Music/04/20/rapper.guru.dies/index.html |archive-date=2010-04-23 |url-status=live }}</ref> Guru appeared to have fallen out with DJ Premier seven years prior to his death and did "not wish my ex-DJ to have anything to do with my name, likeness, events, tributes, etc."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/gang-starr-3-1303087 |title=Gang Starr's Guru dies of cancer |publisher=nme.com |date=2010-04-20 |access-date=2017-03-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318175636/http://www.nme.com/news/music/gang-starr-3-1303087 |archive-date=2017-03-18 |url-status=live }}</ref> There is speculation that the letter was not written by Guru, but was composed by Solar.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8633175.stm | work=BBC News | title=New York rap star Guru dies at 43 | date=2010-04-20 | access-date=2010-06-05 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423063638/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8633175.stm | archive-date=2010-04-23 | url-status=live }}</ref> The validity of the statement was questioned by Guru's family and his contemporaries.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/gang-starr/50781 |title=Gang Starr rapper Guru's family question 'death bed letter' &#124; News |publisher=Nme.Com |access-date=2010-05-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510192514/http://www.nme.com/news/gang-starr/50781 |archive-date=2010-05-10 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Post Guru===
Soon after DJ Premier stated that there was a "posthumous Gang Starr CD/DVD project in the works," and most likely to have been released in 2014,<ref name = "ALLHIPHOP">[http://allhiphop.com/stories/news/archive/2010/12/11/22524589.aspx DJ Premier: New Gang Starr Album And DVD In The Works] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212194602/http://www.allhiphop.com/stories/news/archive/2010/12/11/22524589.aspx |date=2010-12-12 }}. Retrieved 2010-12-11.</ref> but nothing has been released. DJ Premier confirmed in late 2015 that he was working on a Gang Starr biopic with the cooperation of Guru's sister, [[Patricia Elam]].<ref name = "ROLLINGSTONE">[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/after-compton-success-dj-premier-eyes-gang-starr-biopic-20150828.aspx After 'Compton' Succsess, DJ Premier Eyes Gang Starr Biopic]{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}. Retrieved 2015-08-28.</ref>

In 2019, DJ Premier released a new single under the Gang Starr name entitled "Family and Loyalty" featuring [[J. Cole]], to be followed with a new album titled ''One of the Best Yet'', which was released on November 1 that year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2019/09/gang-starr-family-and-loyalty-feat-j-cole|title=Gang Starr Shares "Family and Loyalty" With J.

==Legacy==
The [[Gang Starr Foundation]] was a loose collective of various people who have worked closely with the group, through either Guru's now defunct Ill Kid label, DJ Premier's production work or the management company that Gang Starr was represented by, Empire Management. Members of the foundation included [[Big Shug]], [[Afu-Ra]], [[Jeru the Damaja]], [[Krumbsnatcha]], [[Bumpy Knuckles]], and [[Group Home]].

Each episode title of the first season of the [[Netflix]] series ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'', based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character, was named after a Gang Starr song.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsarama.com/30249-sdcc-2016-marvel-netflix-s-luke-cage-panel.html|title=SDCC 2016: Marvel & Netflix's LUKE CAGE Panel|website=Newsarama|access-date=2019-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190822151817/https://www.newsarama.com/30249-sdcc-2016-marvel-netflix-s-luke-cage-panel.html|archive-date=2019-08-22|url-status=live}}</ref>
