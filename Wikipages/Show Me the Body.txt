== History ==

=== Early Years ===
Julian Pratt first conceived of an early version of Show Me the Body after meeting Harlan Steed in ninth grade at [[Elisabeth Irwin High School]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-04-01|title=Show Me the Body: How Banjo-Wielding Renegades Are Reinventing New York Hardcore|url=https://www.revolvermag.com/music/show-me-body-how-banjo-wielding-renegades-are-reinventing-new-york-hardcore|access-date=2021-04-26|website=Revolver|language=en}}</ref> Julian became increasingly engrossed in the New York hardcore music scene when he volunteered at the Lower Eastside's ABC No Rio social space, a venue that hosts punk daytime punk shows on Saturdays.<ref name=":32">{{Cite web|title=Battle For New York – a weekend spent with Show Me The Body|url=https://www.loudandquiet.com/interview/battle-new-york-weekend-spent-show-body/|access-date=2021-04-26|website=Loud And Quiet|language=en-US}}</ref> They bonded over playing music with Pratt's cousin, their former drummer and eventual in-house producer, Gabriel Millman.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Apr 24|last2=Sculley|first2=2019 {{!}} Alan|last3=Story|first3=Cover|last4=Music|last5=Ventura {{!}} 0 {{!}}|date=2019-04-25|title=QUALITY OVER QUANTITY {{!}} NYC hardcore band Show Me The Body packs a punch in a short show|url=https://vcreporter.com/2019/04/quality-over-quantity-nyc-hardcore-band-show-me-the-body-packs-a-punch-in-a-short-show/|access-date=2021-04-26|website=VC Reporter {{!}} Times Media Group|language=en-US}}</ref> They officially became Show Me the Body around a year after meeting.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|last=Oglesby|first=Daniel|date=2019-12-05|title=Show Me The Body on Breaking Convention - Interview|url=http://radioutd.com/blog/2019/12/show-me-the-body-on-breaking-convention-interview/|access-date=2021-04-26|website=RadioUTD|language=en-US}}</ref> As a way to get up close and personal with fans, instead of clubs, their first shows were played under bridge overpasses, alleys, and in basements.<ref name=":0" />

=== 2014-2015 Yellow Kidney and S.M.T.B. ===
By 2014, the band added current drummer Noah Cohen-Corbett <ref name=":2" /> and formed the musical collective Letter Racer with their classmates in the group [[Ratking (group)|Ratking]] and toured with them that summer.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Show Me the Body: Dog Whistle|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/show-me-the-body-dog-whistle/|access-date=2021-04-26|website=Pitchfork|language=en}}</ref> That year also saw the release of their debut EP, Yellow Kidney, independently released on [[SoundCloud]]. Their release caught the attention of record label [[Loma Vista Recordings|Loma Vista]] which facilitated the subsequent release of their self titled EP, S.M.T.B, in 2015.

=== 2016-2017: Body War and Corpus 1 ===
Their debut album, ''Body War'', was released in 2016. The album touches on themes such as [[anti-capitalism]], [[gentrification]] and [[police brutality]] through a wide range of experimental sounds.<ref name=":32"/> Their collective, CORPUS, released their first self titled mixtape in 2017.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|title=Show Me the Body’s "Dog Whistle" is a community manifesto|url=http://altcitizen.com/show-me-the-bodys-dog-whistle-is-a-community-manifesto/|access-date=2021-04-26|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== 2018-2019: Dog Whistle ===
While on tour in Poland, the band visited the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum]]. This trip served as the influence for their third record, ''Dog Whistle'', released on March 29, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-03-29|title=Show Me the Body: Dog Whistle review – howling punk paranoia everyone can relate to|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/29/show-me-the-body-dog-whistle-review|access-date=2021-04-26|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref> The album was written in Long Island City, and recorded in Los Angeles California the previous summer.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|date=2019-11-17|title=Show Me the Body Shares Politically Charged Music Video for New Single "USA Lullaby" -|url=https://music.mxdwn.com/2019/11/17/news/show-me-the-body-shares-politically-charged-music-video-for-new-single-usa-lullaby/|access-date=2021-04-26|website=mxdwn Music|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== 2020-Present: Survive and the Future ===
Because of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], Show Me the Body "had to reconfigure" how they "interact with" their fans.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|date=2021-02-24|title=Show Me The Body - "Survive"|url=https://www.stereogum.com/2117022/show-me-the-body-survive/music/|access-date=2021-04-26|website=Stereogum|language=en}}</ref> Their reliance on live performances made this difficult, but they opted to establish a new studio space for their CORPUS collective and recorded an EP, titled Survive, which was released in March 2021.<ref name=":5" /> The short EP deals with themes of isolation.

== Style ==
Although primarily punk oriented, Show Me the Body combines the sounds of hip-hop, sludge, and noise in order to craft their unique and abrasive style.<ref name=":1" /> Their conventional instruments, such as Pratt's banjo and Steed's bass, are accompanied by a wide array of pedals, feedback and computer programming <ref name=":0" /> that form the characteristic distortion that features in much of their music. Pratt's vocals along with Cohen-Corbett's aggressive drumming help complete and add weight to the bands immersive and grunge-influenced songs.<ref name=":0" />
