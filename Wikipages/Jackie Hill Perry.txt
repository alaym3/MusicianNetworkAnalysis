'''Jackie Hill Perry''' (née Jackie Hill, born June 21, 1989) is a [[poet]], [[writer]], and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] artist from [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]. Hill Perry initially garnered popularity for her performances of [[spoken word]] pieces such as "My Life as a Stud", "A Poem About Weed", and "Jig-a-Boo" at the Passion 4 Christ Movement (P4CM). She has written for various Christian ministry organizations, such as [[The Resurgence (organization)|The Resurgence]] and [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]]'s Desiring God, on the topic of [[Christianity and homosexuality]]. She signed to the [[Portland, Oregon]]-based [[Christian hip hop]] label Humble Beast in January 2014, and released her debut album on November 4, 2014, available both commercially and for free. Hill married fellow spoken word artist Preston Perry in March 2014, and is pregnant with her first child.

An encounter with sexual abuse as a child contributed to the [[gender dysphoria|confusion over her gender identity]] she faced while growing up, and Hill Perry at age seventeen discovered that she was a [[lesbian]]. She lived a life of sexual [[promiscuity]] and struggled with drug and [[pornography addiction]], until her conversion to Christianity in 2008. Her self-proclaimed status as a former lesbian has sparked controversy, with many gay rights activists stating that [[sexual orientation]] cannot be changed and that Hill Perry's experience lend credence to the idea of [[conversion therapy]]. Hill Perry, however, maintains her belief that God can transform lives and that he empowers believers to resist temptation.

She said an encounter with sexual abuse, school bullying and a lack of attention from boys contributed to her struggle with [[gender confusion]].<ref name="washtimes">{{cite web|last1=Daniels|first1=David|title=Christian rapper Jackie Hill-Perry comes out as ex-gay firebrand|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/27/christian-rapper-jackie-hill-perry-comes-out-as-ex/|website=[[The Washington Times]]|publisher=News World Media Development|access-date=October 29, 2014|date=October 27, 2014}}</ref> Since the age of four, Hill thought she should have been born a boy, and at age six she started imitating male tendencies, such as standing up to use the toilet.<ref name="wade-o" /> At age 17, she started pursuing multiple serial relationships with other women.<ref name="washtimes" /> Hill's second girlfriend suggested that she become a [[Butch and femme|stud]], a woman who takes a masculine role in a lesbian relationship.<ref name="wade-o" /> Hill began to gain attention from girls when she assumed the stud role, explaining that "I was never the 'cute chick' but when I became a stud, it seemed like every girl wanted me. I would be in straight clubs and have girls throwing themselves at me. For a girl that's insecure and craves to feel loved, that was like a drug for me."<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.wholemagazine.org/2013/04/whole-spotlight-jackie-hill.html|title = Whole Spotlight: Jackie Hill|date = April 1, 2013|access-date = November 1, 2014|website = WHOLE Magazine|publisher = Be Made Whole Ministries|last = Flores|first = Ashley|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141030010605/http://www.wholemagazine.org/2013/04/whole-spotlight-jackie-hill.html|archive-date = October 30, 2014|url-status = dead}}</ref>

=== Conversion and current activities (2008–present) ===
As recounted in her poem "My Life as a Stud", Hill states that "...one day, the Lord spoke to me. He said, 'She will be the death of you.' In that moment, the scripture for [[Romans 6#Verse 23|the wages of sin]] equal death finally clicked."<ref name="washtimes" /> Hill left her girlfriend, returned to church, and started writing poetry. She performed her first [[spoken word]] piece at a P4CM poetry conference in 2010, and met Preston Perry, the man who would eventually become her husband.<ref name="washtimes" /> Over time, Hill gradually lost interest in women, and Preston proposed to her in August 2013 through the spoken word poem "The Covenant".<ref name="washtimes" /><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://erlc.com/article/because-jesus-is-better-an-interview-with-spoken-word-artist-jackie-hill|title = Because Jesus is Better: An interview with spoken word artist Jackie Hill|date = March 4, 2014|accessdate = November 1, 2014|website = The Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission|publisher = [[Southern Baptist Convention]]|last = Newbell|first = Trillia}}</ref> The couple married in March 2014, and Hill Perry currently is pregnant with a girl.<ref name="washtimes" /> Hill Perry attributes that change in her sexuality to God's transformation of her life.<ref name="washtimes" />

==Stance on homosexuality==
Jackie Hill Perry maintains that she is an ex-lesbian, and that her transition to heterosexuality is among the changes God worked in her life. On July 31, 2013, Christian hip hop radio show Wade-O Radio published an interview with Hill Perry where she spoke out against the [[Macklemore]] song "[[Same Love]]".<ref name="wade-o">{{cite web|last1=Daniels|first1=David|title=Former Lesbian Jackie Hill Responds to Macklemore’s ‘Same Love’|url=http://wadeoradio.com/former-lesbian-jackie-hill-responds-to-macklemores-same-love/|website=Wade-O Radio|publisher=DJ Wade-O|accessdate=October 29, 2014|date=July 31, 2013}}</ref> Citing 1 Corinthians 6:9-11, she stated that "The word of God itself, apart from Jackie Hill, testifies that people can change. So if the word of God is the word of God, then we need to deal with that and believe that it's true. I think we've made God very little if we believe that he cannot change people. If he can make a moon, stars and a galaxy that we have yet to fully comprehend, how can he not simply change my desires?"<ref name="wade-o" /> This stance has been criticized by many, particularly gay rights activists. According to ''[[The Washington Times]]'', Hill Perry's experience "runs counter to pronouncements by gay rights groups that exclaim sexuality as an inherent, immutable characteristic", and, even further, comes amid "wide-ranging reports about the psychological dangers of so-called '[[reparative therapy]],' which aims to change the orientation of homosexuals."<ref name="washtimes" /> Hill Perry estimates that about 40 percent of the messages she has received over social media have been negative.<ref name="washtimes" /> When Hill married Preston Perry in March 2014, one critic accused the couple of both being gay and marrying to "play God to a bunch of ignorant people."<ref name="washtimes" />

However, Hill Perry, in her 2013 interview with Wade-O Radio, clarified that she does not believe that every Christian with a homosexual disposition will lose those desires. "If God chooses not to change my desires, he has promised to give me his Holy Spirit that will help me flee from them. There are people who were alcoholics for 20 years, went through rehab and they don't drink anymore, but sometimes they may be tested. If they see a bottle of whiskey, they're going to want that whisky, but they have a choice."<ref name="wade-o" />

== Influences ==
In an interview with [[The Gospel Coalition]], Hill Perry cited [[Mali Music (singer)|Mali Music]], [[Propaganda (musician)|Propaganda]], and Ebony Moore as "a few people who inspire me to be great at my craft."<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/coming-to-you-raw-and-uncut-with-jackie-hill/|title = Coming to You Raw and Uncut with Jackie Hill|date = October 25, 2012|access-date = October 29, 2014|website = |publisher = [[The Gospel Coalition]]|last = Smethurst|first = Matt}}</ref> Theologically, she names pastor [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]] as a major influence, and even based ''Art of Joy'' on Piper's book ''Desiring God'', where Piper explains his concept of [[Christian hedonism]]. Hill Perry states that <blockquote>Aside from the [[doctrines of grace]], it's one concept that has really renewed my mind when it comes to faith and sin. Now, when I look at certain sins, it's not, 'Oh, I'm just doing this because I want to.' No, what in this sin do you think will satisfy me that God can't? It makes my processing of my issues a lot deeper, and it's also expanded my view of God.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Daniels|first1=David|title=John Piper's book 'Desiring God' inspires Jackie Hill-Perry's album|url=http://www.rapzilla.com/rz/features/interviews/9441-john-piper-s-book-desiring-god-inspires-jackie-hill-perry-s-album|website=[[Rapzilla]]|publisher=Philip Rood and Chad Horton|access-date=November 20, 2014|date=November 17, 2014}}</ref></blockquote>
