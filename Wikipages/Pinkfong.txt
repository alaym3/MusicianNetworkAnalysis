==History==
===Formation===
Pinkfong was formed with the inception of SmartStudy at their [[Seoul]] headquarters, in June 2010. A [[Los Angeles]] branch with a few employees opened in 2016, and another is located in [[Shanghai]]. The U.S. branch's CEO Bin Jeong said the name was created from the pink fox character, and the fun sound of "fong" that sounded similar to "phone".<ref name="savvy">{{cite web|title=Pinkfong Q&A|url=https://thesavvyscreener.com/2017/08/14/pinkfong-qa/|date=August 14, 2017|work=The Savvy Screener|access-date=November 27, 2018}}</ref> The focus is children ages one to five years old. By 2015, the company had released 520 [[mobile app]]s with central base apps like "Pinkfong Nursery Rhymes".<ref name="hank">{{cite web|last=Kwon|first=Oh-seong|title=휴가 무제한인 회사…그래도 잘 나가요|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/economy_general/686640.html|date=April 13, 2015|work=[[The Hankyoreh]]|language=ko|access-date=November 27, 2018}}</ref> SmartStudy's CFO and co-founder Lee Ryan Seung-kyu said typical nursery rhymes were usually "slow and calm" so they began with a small project, searching for a more upbeat song "for the new generation" that would appeal globally.<ref name="zee"/> The "Pinkfong!

===Comparisons to other animations===
Pinkfong joined another "beloved" [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] character named [[Pororo the Little Penguin|Pororo]], a longtime children's favorite in South Korea, in the preschool education market. Both characters became recognizable worldwide and like Pororo, children and parents began associating the pink fox with children's education.<ref name="starting">{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Ho-jeong|title=How SmartStudy's pink fox became a global hit|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=3035971|date=July 18, 2017|work=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|access-date=November 27, 2018}}</ref> In May 2017, journalist Kim Young-joo of the newspaper [[JoongAng Ilbo]] wrote that Pinkfong, a pink [[Fennec fox|desert fox]] character that combines a fox and a phone, is "emerging as the second Pororo", with housewives with young children calling him "President Pinkfong".<ref name="teach">{{cite web|last=Kim|first=Young-joo|title=통통 튀는 핑크퐁, 뽀로로가 샘내겠네요|url=https://news.joins.com/article/21565204|date=May 12, 2017|work=[[JoongAng Ilbo]]|language=ko|access-date=November 27, 2018}}</ref> CEO Lee said that Pinkfong might be described "somewhere between [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] and [[Sesame Street]]".<ref name="starting"/> An August 2018 comparison of YouTube channel subscribers showed the established brand, Sesame Street, had 3.9&nbsp;million subscribers and Pinkfong had 10 million.<ref name="zee"/>

===YouTube channel===
The YouTube channel videos include educational preschool songs, rhymes and stories that incorporate the use of colors, numbers and letters. Song lyrics are repetitive, animation is bright and bold, and they run about one to two minutes in length. Some are grouped in video compilations, like "Planet Songs" and "Christmas Carols", and in addition to animation, some include [[Clay animation|claymation]] and child actors.<ref name="common">{{cite web|last=Ashby|first=Emily|title=Pinkfong!|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/youtube-reviews/pinkfong|work=[[Common Sense Media]]|access-date=November 27, 2018|date=April 11, 2018}}</ref> The short length was made to accommodate [[Mobile phone|cell phone]] views on both YouTube and SmartStudy's education mobile apps.<ref name="zee"/> Three of their most popular videos are "Baby Shark", "Police Car" and "The Lion."<ref name="savvy"/> The receptiveness of children watching "Baby Shark" was shown in a YouTube video of an elementary school class of 55 students in [[Xi'an]], China, posted by their English teacher, Frenchman Florian Marquette, in late 2015.

The Pinkfong "Baby Shark" uses the traditional chant, incorporates a repetitive verse, and adds [[K-pop]] style music.<ref name="zee"/><ref name="strong"/> Lee Sung-bok, chairman of the Korea Children's Music Composer Association, said the lyrics that incorporate three generations of the shark family were significant in its success, and said, "Kids love the baby shark song for its easy and repetitive rhythm".<ref name="zee"/> Songwriter [[Jin Jin (musician)|Jin Jin]] said the song accomplished the goal of simplicity, which professional songwriters aim for, "A pop song definitely needs a big hook. That's the most important thing," and, "It's got the repetition, and the 'do do do do do' is a global, international language. Any country or language can relate to that."<ref name="bbc"/>

Gary Cross, a [[Pennsylvania State University]] [[Cultural history|cultural historian]] who specializes in [[History of childhood#Modern Childhood|modern childhood]], said, "A simple song that isn't tied too radically to a given culture can, with the right technology, easily become global," and, "Children are not yet fully embedded in a culture, and they’re very adaptable to [[fad]]s". He said a simple song like "[[Happy Birthday to You]]" spread globally before technology, and successful children's commercial popular culture like [[Hello Kitty]] and [[Nintendo]] from Asia, that "embrace a more playful, imaginative fantasy world for children", had been around for some time.<ref name="wash"/> The song is both nostalgic and culturally significant for [[Millennials|millennial]] parents, some who remembered the camp song's darker version, but were amenable to a South Korean version that would help their children develop diverse cultural backgrounds.<ref name="wash"/><ref name="bbc"/>
