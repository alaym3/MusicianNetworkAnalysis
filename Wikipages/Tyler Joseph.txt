== Discography ==
===As solo artist===
====''No Phun Intended''====
Before assembling the band Twenty One Pilots, Tyler Joseph recorded the self-released ''No Phun Intended'' album in his basement between 2007 and 2008, during Joseph's senior year of high school. The songs recorded during Joseph's solo-career are nonetheless celebrated and have made several appearances in the band's future projects. It was later revealed that aside from Joseph, Nick Thomas also contributed guitar to several of the songs on the record.

Although not on the album, the song "Going Down" and an untitled demo surfaced on the [[Internet]] on July 2, 2018.

Due to its comical nature, this song has become an internet [[meme]] in the Twenty One Pilots fan community.

|The existence of this track is the subject of speculation, but it is said to predate both known version of "Trees," from ''Regional at Best'' and ''[[Vessel (Twenty One Pilots album)|Vessel]]''.
