==History==

===''Ex:Re'' (2018)===
On 26 November 2018, Tonra revealed the new project, with the release of a first single and video titled "Romance".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://diymag.com/2018/11/26/daughter-elena-tonra-solo-album-ex-re-romance-listen |title="Daughter’s Elena Tonra announces solo album as Ex:Re" |work=[[DIY (magazine)|DIY]]}}</ref> It came with the announcement that a full-length album would follow a few days later, after a debut show at London’s [[Hoxton Hall]] on 28 November. ''Ex:Re'' came out digitally on 30 November 2018 via the labels [[4AD]] and [[Glassnote Records|Glassnote]]. It was later released physically on CD and vinyl on 1 February 2019, with a limited blue pressing of the vinyl, including a live EP captured at the initial Hoxton Hall performance, to celebrate being [[Rough Trade (shops)|Rough Trade]]’s Album Of The Month.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.roughtrade.com/gb/albums-of-the-month-february-2019 |title=“Album of the Month - February 2019 |work=[[Rough Trade (shops)]] }}</ref>

Centred around a breakup,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/recommends/listen/exre-a-new-classic-in-the-breakup-album-canon |title="Ex:Re," A New Classic in the Breakup-Album Canon |work=[[The New Yorker]] }}</ref> Tonra said of the album: ''“Although the record is written for someone, a lot of the time it’s about the space without that person in it.  In every scenario, there's either the person in memory or the noticeable absence of that person in the present moment. I suppose it is a break-up record, however I do not talk about the relationship at all, and he hardly features in the scenes.  He is only felt as a ghostly presence.”''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://4ad.com/news/26/11/2018/introducingexrethesolorecordingsofelenatonrafromdaughter |title=Introducing Ex:Re, The Solo Recordings of Elena Tonra from Daughter |work=[[4AD]] }}</ref>

The album was produced and mixed by 4AD in-house engineer Fabian Prynn, with composer [[Josephine Stephenson]] on cello.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/ExRe-ExRe/release/13704160 |title=Ex:Re - Ex:Re |work=[[Discogs]] }}</ref>

===''Ex:Re with 12 Ensemble'' (2021)===

On 16 February 2021, Tonra announced the imminent release of a collaboration album titled ''Ex:Re with 12 Ensemble'', a reimagination of the original songs for strings by the composer and Ex:Re cellist Josephine Stephenson, captured live at London’s [[Kings Place]] in November 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/en_asia/news/music/daughters-elena-tonra-announces-reinterpretation-of-solo-debut-album-exre-2882460 |title=Daughter’s Elena Tonra announces reinterpretation of solo debut album ‘Ex:Re’ | work=[[NME]] }}</ref> The first single to come out was ''Where The Time Went'', accompanied by a video of empty London streets directed by Tonra herself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.undertheradarmag.com/news/exre_elena_tonra_of_daughter_announces_new_album_shares_video_for_where_the/ |title=Ex:Re (Elena Tonra of Daughter) Announces New Album, Shares Video for "Where the Time Went" | work=[[Under the Radar (magazine)|Under the Radar]] }}</ref> The full album came out on digital platforms on 19 February.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://4ad.com/releases/943 |title='Ex:Re with 12 Ensemble' | work=[[4AD]] }}</ref>
