'''María Isabel Pantoja Martín''' ({{IPA-es|isaˈβel panˈtoha}}; born August 2, 1956) is a Spanish singer. She was born in the [[Triana (Seville)|Triana]] district of [[Seville]], Spain. She has released more than a dozen albums throughout a career spanning many decades, mostly of ''[[Copla (music)|copla]]'' genre, and is known for her distinctive [[Andalusia]]n style.

==Biography==
She was born in a Romani family of musicians. Both her father and her grandfather were singers.

Pantoja began performing precociously at the age of seven in the flamenco ensemble of her cousin Chiquetete. At 17 she met her "maestro" Juan Solano Pedrero, who wrote her first hits along with writer and poet Rafael de León. Pantoja cultivated [[Copla (music)|copla]], a genre in decline at the moment that she popularised again. Some of her early hits were "El Pájaro Verde", "Garlochí" or "El Señorito". In 1983 she released her first pop album, ''Cambiar por ti'', which included the same-title song, "En la Niebla", or "Nada". From that moment, Pantoja alternated ballads and romantic songs with copla.

On April 30, 1983 she married bullfighter [[Francisco Rivera Pérez|Francisco Rivera Pérez "Paquirri"]]; the wedding was widely covered by the Spanish media as they were both popular and successful and they embodied a Romantic Spain stereotype of the bullfighter and the ''"[[Tonadilla|tonadillera]]"''. On September 26, 1984 he died in the bullring; Pantoja became known as "Spain's widow" in the media and a regular cover on [[gossip magazine]]s. After a prolonged hiatus, she released the album ''Marinero de Luces'', composed by [[José Luis Perales]], that sold one million copies in Spain. 

In 1988, she released ''[[Desde Andalucía]]'', an album produced by Mexican singer and songwriter [[Juan Gabriel]]. In 1989 she released ''Se me enamora el alma'', her most commercial album, with modern programmed beats, composed by Perales.

In 1990, Pantoja starred in the film ''Yo soy ésa'', alongside [[José Coronado]] and [[Loles León]], directed by Luis Sanz. A year later, she starred in another film, ''El día que nací yo'', directed by [[Pedro Olea]], alongside [[Arturo Fernández Rodríguez|Arturo Fernández]] and [[Joaquim de Almeida]]. 

Pantoja has released more than a dozen albums and has toured Spain and Latin America extensively over the years.

==Family life==
Her husband, the bullfighter [[Francisco Rivera Pérez]], known professionally as "[[Paquirri]]", died at the age of 36 in the bullring on September 26, 1984, at the horns of the bull ''Avispado'' in [[Pozoblanco]], [[Córdoba (Spanish province)|Córdoba]]. Isabel Pantoja and "Paquirri" had a son named [[Francisco José Rivera Pantoja]] (born February 9, 1984 in [[Seville]]), better known as Kiko Rivera or "Paquirrín". Pantoja has another daughter, named like herself María Isabel Pantoja Martín (born November 8, 1995 in [[Lima]], [[Peru]]), whom she adopted in 1996, and who is better known as Isa Pantoja or "Chabelita". Both her children are television personalities who have participated in [[Reality television|reality shows]].

==Legal problems==
Pantoja was arrested in April 2013 by the [[Spanish police]]. She was accused of allegedly being an accomplice of her ex-boyfriend [[Julián Muñoz]], who was accused of [[money laundering]], bribery among other criminal activities while he was mayor of [[Marbella]]. She was found guilty and sentenced to a 24-month prison term. She later paid approximately four million euros and made a plea to avoid having to go to prison.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2013/04/16/andalucia_malaga/1366100575.html |title=Isabel Pantoja, condenada a 24 meses de cárcel por blanqueo de capitales &#124; Andalucía-Málaga |work=El Mundo|location=Spain |access-date=June 1, 2015}}</ref>

On November 3, 2014 the jury in [[Málaga]] decided to deny the plea of suspension of imprisonment, and ordered the immediate entry of Pantoja in the prison complex within 3 days after the verdict.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2014/11/20/actualidad/1416477517_078528.html |title=Isabel Pantoja entra en la cárcel &#124; España |work=EL PAÍS |access-date=June 1, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Roterman|first1=Natalie|title=Isabel Pantoja Sentenced To Two Years in Prison For Money Laundering|url=http://www.latintimes.com/isabel-pantoja-sentenced-two-years-prison-money-laundering-276879|website=Latin Times|access-date=January 7, 2015}}</ref> The trial and Pantoja's entry in prison were widely covered by Spanish media.
