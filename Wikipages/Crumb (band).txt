== History ==
Ramani, Brotter, Aronow, and Gilad met at [[Tufts University]], often living and playing together until 2016, when they developed and recorded a collection of songs Ramani had started writing in high school and college. The collaboration resulted in the band’s first two EPs, ''Crumb'' (2016) and ''Locket'' (2017), the latter of which was released while the band was split between Boston and New York. Both EPs were independently released, with limited vinyl runs and [[Cassette tape|cassettes]] released by [[Do it yourself|DIY]] label Citrus City Records.

Crumb went on to release their debut full-length album, ''Jinx'', on June 14, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/crumb-announce-debut-album-jinx-share-new-song-nina-listen/|title=Crumb Announce Debut Album Jinx, Share New Song “Nina”: Listen|website=Pitchfork Media|language=en|access-date=2019-05-11}}</ref> The album received positive reviews from music critics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/crumb-jinx/|title=Crumb: Jinx|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/06/album-review-crumb-jinx/|title=Crumb Play Snake Charmer to Mental Disquiet on Jinx|date=2019-06-13|website=Consequence of Sound|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review-crumb-jinx-is-a-psych-rock-debut-thats-hard-to-shake/|title=Review: Crumb’s Jinx Is a Psych-Rock Debut That’s Hard to Shake|last=Ordaz|first=Sophia|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>

== Music style ==
Indie Current described Crumb's sound on 'Locket' as psychedelic slacker-rock.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indiecurrent.com/crumbs-instant-classic-locket-is-our-favorite-music-video-right-now/|title=Crumb's Instant Classic "Locket" Is Our Favorite Music Video Right Now|date=2018-03-17|website=Indie Current|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-20}}</ref> [[Paste (magazine)|Paste Magazine]] called their sound a meld of "60s psych, loose jazz, and freeform indie rock into a soothing pop amalgamation."
Others describe them as psychedelic jazzy Lofi dream pop.
