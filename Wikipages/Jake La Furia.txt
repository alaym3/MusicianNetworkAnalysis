'''Francesco Vigorelli''' (born 25 February 1979), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Jake La Furia''', is an Italian [[rapper]], [[record producer]] and [[radio host]]. He was formerly a member of the [[hip hop music|hip hop]] duo [[Club Dogo]] with rapper [[Gué Pequeno]] and producer [[Don Joe]]. He was also in "[[Sacre Scuole]]", a group consisting of him, Gué Pequeno, and [[Dargen D'Amico]].

==Biography==
===Sacre Scuole===
He is the son of Giampietro Vigorelli, a well-known artistic advertising director of the agency D'Adda Lorenzini Vigorelli BBDO.<ref name=Bio>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mondorap.it/artisti/jake-la-furia/ |title=Jake la Furia Bio |access-date=11 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627190232/http://www.mondorap.it/artisti/jake-la-furia/ |archive-date=27 June 2013}}</ref> Vigorelli came into contact with [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]] through [[Graffiti]], which he started practicing around 1993. His first nickname was Fame, originating from his ''[[:it:Tag (firma)|tag]]'' (graffiti signature).<ref name=Bio/> A little later he started rapping, becoming one of the best known [[Rapping#Emcees|MCs]] in the [[Milan]] area. Together with his companions [[Gué Pequeno]] and [[Dargen D'Amico]] he formed the [[Sacre Scuole]], participating in albums and mixtapes by artists such as Chief, Solo Zippo, [[:it:ATPC|ATPC]] and Prodigio.

In 1999 they released their first album, ''[[:it:3 MC's al cubo|3 MC's al cubo]]'' ("3 Mcs [[Cube (algebra)|Cubed]]"), whose executive producer is Chief. In 2001 arguments between him and D'Amico led to the dissolution of the group: Jake and Gué formed together with Don Joe (with whom they had already collaborated for their first album) the [[Club Dogo]] while D'Amico undertook a solo career. However, the two would later make peace and D'Amico would collaborate on a track of Club Dogo's first album.

===Club Dogo===
In the new group, Vigorelli changed his nickname to Jake La Furia, in tribute to the character Jake the Muss (Jake "La Furia") from the movie ''[[Once Were Warriors (film)|Once Were Warriors]]''.<ref name=Bio/> The first album of the group, ''[[:it:Mi fist|Mi fist]]'', was released in 2003. The album was named best rap record at ''[[:it:MC Giaime|MC Giaime]]'' in 2004. In 2006 their second album, ''[[:it:Penna capitale|Penna capitale]]'' ("Capital Pen"), was released, while in 2007 they released their third album, ''[[:it:Vile denaro|Vile denaro]]'' ("Base Money"), their first with a major label, [[EMI]]. After this album their talent began to be recognized also by other majors: this led them to sign a contract with [[Universal Music Italia|Universal]]. The first record to come out under this label was ''[[:it:Dogocrazia|Dogocrazia]]'' ("[[Club Dogo|Dogo]] [[wikt:-cracy#English|cracy]]"), which contains many collaborations with other artists of the Italian hip hop scene and two with the US artists [[Kool G Rap]] and [[Infamous Mobb]].

On 29 June 2010, the single "Per la gente" ("For the People") was released on their official website, which anticipated the release of the album ''[[:it:Che bello essere noi|Che bello essere noi]]'' ("Nice to be us"), on 5 October. The album was also promoted by singles "Spacco tutto" ("Breaking everything") and "DDD". The album debuted at the second position of the Italian album chart. ''[[:it:Noi siamo il club|Noi siamo il club]]'' ("We are the Club"), the sixth album by Dogo, anticipated by the single "[[:it:Cattivi esempi|Cattivi esempi]]" ("Bad Examples") released on 24 April, was released on 5 June 2012. The group later collaborated on the 2012 album ''[[:it:Hanno ucciso l'Uomo Ragno 2012|Hanno ucciso l'Uomo Ragno 2012]]'' by [[Max Pezzali]], singing on the track ''Con un deca'',<ref>[http://maxpezzali.it/node/4005 Hanno ucciso l'uomo ragno 2012, recensione] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221012136/http://maxpezzali.it/node/4005 |date=21 December 2013 }}</ref> while in 2014 they released their seventh studio album ''[[:it:Non siamo più quelli di Mi fist|Non siamo più quelli di Mi fist]]'' ("We aren't those of [[:it:Mi fist|Mi fist]] anymore").
