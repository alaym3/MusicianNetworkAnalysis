Their first single, "[[I Wanna Get Better]]", was released February 18, 2014.

== Career ==
=== 2014–2015: Origins and ''Strange Desire'' ===
While on the road with his band, [[Fun (band)|Fun]], Antonoff began working on a new project during his time in different cities. For about a year he kept the project a secret until February 18, 2014, when the first single "[[I Wanna Get Better]]" was released along with the launch of Bleachers' website, social media profiles, and a selection of tour dates.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bleachers NYC|url=http://donyc.com/artists/bleachers|website=Donyc.com|access-date=23 February 2017}}</ref> News of Bleachers was first publicly announced in a Facebook post by Brooklyn music studio Mission Sound in May 2013.<ref>{{cite web |first=Ryan |last=Cormier |title=Just what is Bleachers act announced for Firefly? |publisher=Delaware Online |url=http://www.delawareonline.com/story/entertainment/music/2014/01/21/just-what-is-bleachers-act-announced-for-firefly/4724521/ |access-date=March 2, 2014 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Nmy3Azqp?url=http://www.delawareonline.com/story/entertainment/music/2014/01/21/just-what-is-bleachers-act-announced-for-firefly/4724521/ |archive-date=March 3, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

About making the first Bleachers album, Antonoff said, "I spent the past year working on the music but not talking about it, and eventually it became this psychotic alter-ego situation, where it was second nature to have this part of me that no one knew about. Except for a small group of people, most of which happened to be members of my immediate family, no one was aware that this music, or this album even existed ... even though it existed so deeply to me."<ref>{{cite web |last=Montgomery |first=James |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1722499/jack-antonoff-fun-bleachers-band.jhtml |title=How Taylor Swift And Hayley Williams Helped Fun.'s Guitarist Go Solo |publisher=MTV |date=February 17, 2014 |access-date=February 19, 2014 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Nmx8AuE5?url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1722499/jack-antonoff-fun-bleachers-band.jhtml |archive-date=March 3, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Antonoff also stated that Bleachers was never meant to be a departure from his position in Fun.,<ref>{{cite web |last=Obenschain |first=Philip |url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/bleachers_fun.s_jack_antonoff_unveil_debut_single_tour_dates_announce_yoko |publisher=Alternative Press |title=Bleachers (Fun.'s Jack Antonoff) unveil debut single, tour dates, announce Yoko Ono collaboration |date=February 19, 2014 |access-date=February 19, 2014 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Nmx37YmT?url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/bleachers_fun.s_jack_antonoff_unveil_debut_single_tour_dates_announce_yoko |archive-date=March 3, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and that he will remain in the band.

On September 25, 2015, Bleachers released ''Terrible Thrills, Vol. 2'', a sequel to ''Strange Desire.'' The album contained songs from ''Strange Desire'' being covered by numerous female artists with modified tunes. When asked about the album, Antonoff told Billboard “I hear my songs being sung by females before I change them and make them into my voice. The whole heart of this idea is for people to hear the album the way I hear it in my head, reinterpreted by the artists who sort of inspired it to be written in the first place.” Covers were contributed from artists such as [[Sara Bareilles]], [[Charli XCX]], and [[Sia (musician)|Sia]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6714493/bleachers-jack-antonoff-interview-covers-album|title=Bleachers' Jack Antonoff Explains All-Female Covers Album, Gives New Album Update|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-02-28}}</ref> The band appeared as the fictional band Baby Goya and The Nuclear Winters in the 2015 film ''[[Hello, My Name Is Doris]]''.

=== 2017–2019: ''Gone Now'' and ''Love, Simon'' ===

Bleachers' second album ''[[Gone Now]]'' was released June 2, 2017. Its lead single "Don't Take the Money" has been described by Atwood Magazine as "an epic uplifting pop-rock anthem ultimately about how when love is real, its worth everything that comes along with it". In celebration of the album release, he brought his childhood bedroom on tour with him. He had it dismantled and rebuilt inside of a portable trailer. During May and June concerts, fans could enter the "moving, living art exhibit" and listen to the album prior to its official release. Antonoff explained in a press release, saying "when I thought about where this album was coming from and what it’s kissing goodbye I thought of this room. I wished I could play the album for people who care about Bleachers in this space that it is coming from and leaving."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.spin.com/2017/05/bleachers-jack-antonoff-bedroom-trailer-tour/|title=Bleachers' Jack Antonoff Takes Childhood Home on Tour|date=2017-05-17|work=Spin|access-date=2018-02-28}}</ref> The band was on its Gone Now Era: Part 1 tour from September to November 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bleachersmusic/status/889925272639864838|title=new headline dates added this fall w/ @thatgirlbishop, tickets on-sale at 10am friday|last=bleachers|date=2017-07-25|website=@bleachersmusic|language=en|access-date=2018-02-28}}</ref> The tour featured Tove Stryke, Bishop Briggs, and Tangerine as openers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bleachersmusic.com|title=Don't Take The Money|website=bleachersmusic.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-05}}</ref>
