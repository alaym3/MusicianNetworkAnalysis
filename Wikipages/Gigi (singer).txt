'''Ejigayehu Shibabaw''', known by her stage name '''Gigi''' (born 1974), is an [[Ethiopia]]n singer. She has performed the [[music of Ethiopia]] in combination with a wide variety of other [[Musical genre|genres]], often in collaboration with her husband [[Bill Laswell]], a bassist and producer.

==Early life and career==
Gigi was born and raised in [[Chagni]] in northwestern Ethiopia.  She has described learning traditional songs from an [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] priest in the family home.<ref name="gigi">{{Cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/ejigayehu#more | title=Ejigayehu Shibabaw Official Myspace|access-date=February 19, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912003932/http://www.myspace.com/ejigayehu|archive-date=September 12, 2009}}</ref>{{efn|Gigi has further claimed that "I grew up singing in the Ethiopian Church, which is actually not allowed for women…."<ref name="gigi" /> The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] maintains that "both men and women may join in the singing,"<ref name="eotc">{{Citation | url=http://www.ethiopianorthodox.org/english/ethiopian/worship.html | title=Worship in the Ethiopian Orthodx {{Sic|nolink=y}} Church | work=The Church of Ethiopia: A Panorama Of History and Spiritual Life |date=December 1970 | publisher=[[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] | authors=Professor Sergew Hable Sellassie and Belaynesh Mikael | access-date=February 19, 2013 | via=Ethiopianorthodox.org}}</ref> while ethnomusicologist Kay Kaufman Shelemay notes that the church generally prohibited women from singing or playing music in church until the [[Derg]] era of the 1970s.<ref name="shelemay">{{Cite interview | last=Shelemay | first=Kay Kaufman | title=Ethiopia: Diaspora and Return | interviewer= [[Banning Eyre]]| url=http://www.afropop.org/wp/6297/ethiopia-part-2-diaspora-and-return/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217131503/http://www.afropop.org/multi/interview/ID/108/Kay+Kaufman+Shelemay-Ethiopia:+Diaspora+and+Return | archive-date=February 17, 2012 | work=[[Afropop Worldwide]] | date=September 15, 2006 | access-date=February 19, 2013}}</ref>}}  She lived in [[Kenya]] for a few years before moving to [[San Francisco]] in about 1998.

Gigi recorded two albums for the expatriate Ethiopian community, but it was her 2001 album, titled simply ''Gigi'', that brought her widespread attention.  She had been noticed by [[Palm Pictures]] owner [[Chris Blackwell]], who had years earlier introduced [[reggae]] to the mainstream through his former label, [[Island Records]]. Blackwell and Gigi's producer (and later, husband) [[Bill Laswell]], decided to use American [[jazz]] musicians (including [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Wayne Shorter]], [[Pharoah Sanders]], and others) to accompany Gigi on the album.

The result was a fusion of contemporary and traditional sounds. The album was a critical success internationally and generated controversy in her home country for such a radical break with Ethiopian popular music.<ref name=lesnouvelles>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222192034/http://www.lesnouvelles.org/P10_magazine/16_analyse02/16088_gigifalceto-eng.html|archive-date=22 February 2012|url=http://www.lesnouvelles.org/P10_magazine/16_analyse02/16088_gigifalceto-eng.html|title=Alfanalech - Gigi Between Past and Future|access-date=2007-07-12|last=Falceto|first=Francis|author-link = Francis Falceto|work=Les nouvelles d'Addis|quote=What is new with Gigi and Bill Laswell, is the extremely modernist bent of an enterprise which marks, like it or not, a radical break with the usual routine and the decadence prevalent for the past quarter-century.}}</ref> This release was soon followed by ''[[Illuminated Audio]]'',  an ambient dub style remix of the album by Laswell.

2003 saw the release of ''Zion Roots'', under the band name Abyssinia Infinite. Bill Laswell played [[guitar]] and [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]] (instead of his usual bass), and several of Gigi's family members contributed vocals. The album was a return to a mainly acoustic sound for Gigi, incorporating instruments such as the [[krar]] and the [[tabla]]. The track "Gole" is in [[Agaw languages|Agaw]], the language of Gigi's father's village.

Gigi's voice can be heard in the [[Hollywood]] film ''[[Beyond Borders (film)|Beyond Borders]]'' (2003), in which [[Angelina Jolie]] portrays an aid worker during the [[1984 - 1985 famine in Ethiopia]].

She released her Three album, ''Gold and Wax'' on [[Palm Pictures]], in 2006.

She has also appeared in "Running From the Light" in [[Buckethead]]'s ''[[Enter the Chicken]]'' (2005). In 2010, she recorded ''Mesgana Ethiopia'' with [[Material (band)|Material]], released on the [[M.O.D.
