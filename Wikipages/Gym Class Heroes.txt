'''Gym Class Heroes''' were an American [[rap rock]] band from [[Geneva, New York]]. The group formed in 1997 when [[Travie McCoy]] met drummer [[Matt McGinley]] during their high school [[Physical education|gym class]]. The band's music displays a wide variety of influences, including [[hip hop]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[funk]], and [[reggae]]. After the addition of guitarist Disashi Lumumba-Kasongo and bassist Eric Roberts in 2003, the group was signed to [[Fueled by Ramen]] and [[DCD2 Records|Decaydance Records]] ([[Fall Out Boy]] bassist [[Pete Wentz]]'s independent record label), on which they released their debut album, ''[[The Papercut Chronicles]]''. The group gained a strong fanbase while promoting the album, appearing at festivals such as [[The Bamboozle]] and [[Vans Warped Tour]].

In 2006, the group released the [[RIAA Certification|gold-selling]] album ''[[As Cruel as School Children]]''. Since that release, the band's single "[[Cupid's Chokehold]]" peaked at number four on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and peaked within the top ten of the charts in various countries, including the United Kingdom, and "[[Clothes Off!!]]" peaked within the top ten of the charts in Finland, the Republic of Ireland, and the United Kingdom. On September 9, 2008, Gym Class Heroes released their third album, ''[[The Quilt]]'', which contained numerous collaborations with other artists. The band went on hiatus in 2009, a time in which the members pursued various side projects. McCoy released his solo debut album ''[[Lazarus (Travie McCoy album)|Lazarus]]'' in June 2010. Lumumba-Kasongo has been working on his side-project Soul, while McGinley now drums in the rock group [[Kill the Frontman]]. The group released ''[[The Papercut Chronicles II]]'' on November 15, 2011. It has since become one of their most successful albums to date.

===1998–2001: ''Hed Candy'', ''Greasy Kid Stuff'', and ''...For the Kids''===
The original group began playing college parties and BBQs, birthday parties, clubs, and festivals which eventually led to larger venues throughout the northeast, including four years on [[Warped Tour]] (2003, 2004, 2006, 2008). McCoy won [[MTV]]'s Direct Effect MC Battle and as a prize, appeared in [[Styles P]]'s video "Daddy Get That Cash".<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/gym-class-heroes-p693478/biography|title=Gym Class Heroes Biography|last=Apar|first=Corey|work=Allmusic|access-date=2010-12-27}}</ref> The group had three more releases from 1999 to 2004: ''Hed Candy'', ''[[Greasy Kid Stuff]]'', and ''[[...For the Kids]]''.

===2002–2005: ''The Papercut EP'', ''The Papercut Chronicles'', and Bonacci's and Geise's departure===
In 2003 the band recorded the album ''[[The Papercut Chronicles]]'' while on tour. The members were not even finished working on the album, as it caught the attention of [[Fall Out Boy]]'s bassist [[Pete Wentz]], who signed the group to his offspring [[Fueled By Ramen]] label, [[DCD2 Records|Decaydance Records]].<ref name="Allmusic"/> At this time, guitarist Milo Bonacci (who went on to form [[Ra Ra Riot]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080824223109/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/22683004/page/3 Cover Story], ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.</ref>) parted ways with the band and was replaced with current guitarist Disashi Lumumba-Kasongo (brother of the rapper [[Sammus]]), who was attending [[Cornell University]] at the time.<ref name="Submerge">{{cite web|url=http://submergemag.com/featured/flipside-of-fame/996/|title=The Flipside of Fame|last=Gillespie|first=Blake|work=Submerge|date=2009-10-19|access-date=2010-12-29}}</ref> On the first day the band began to rehearse with Lumumba-Kasongo, "[[Cupid's Chokehold]]" was written, which would become the album's first single.<ref name="Submerge"/> McGinley recalled, "We just had intentions of working him in on old songs, but we ended up jamming on this [[Supertramp]] thing for a minute and got carried away and wrote a song."<ref name="High School">{{cite web|title=Life after high school turns 'Cruel' for Gym Class Heroes ; Band's surprise hit 'Cupid's Chokehold' grips the charts|last=Mansfield|first=Brian|date=March 19, 2007|work=[[USA Today]]}}</ref> The group released the four-song ''Papercut Chronicles EP'' before finally releasing ''The Papercut Chronicles'' in February 2005. After Eric Roberts replaced Ryan Geise on bass, the group toured constantly throughout 2005, appearing at the year's [[SXSW]], [[The Bamboozle]], and [[Warped Tour]] festivals. [[Music video]]s were filmed for the songs "[[Taxi Driver (song)|Taxi Driver]]" and "yes".

===2006–2007: ''As Cruel as School Children''===
In May 2006, [[WXSS]], a radio station in [[Milwaukee]], began playing "Cupid's Chokehold" shortly before the release of the band's second full-length album, ''[[As Cruel as School Children]]''. The group's manager, Scott Nagelberg stated "As more stations added it, it became undeniable: This was the chance for this band to make it happen."<ref name="High School"/> Although the band intended to promote a different song, "[[The Queen and I (song)|The Queen and I]]" as the album's lead single, the label shifted its focus to "Cupid's Chokehold". The group became frustrated with its association with the song after its scheduled performance of "The Queen and I" on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' was changed to "Cupid's Chokehold" last minute.<ref name="High School"/> However, McGinley later stated, "Eventually, we saw the rationale. It's a little awkward, but it's still Gym Class Heroes. At the end of the day, it's a good song we all believe in, so we're happy it's getting a lot of attention."<ref name="High School"/> It became the band's most successful single, peaking at number four on the ''[[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]''.<ref name="Allmusic"/> On July 25, 2006, Gym Class Heroes released ''As Cruel as School Children''. The record contained guest appearances by [[Patrick Stump]] of Fall Out Boy and [[William Beckett (singer)|William Beckett]] from [[The Academy Is...]]. The album marked a departure in the band's sound, with the band utilizing [[drum machine]]s and [[synthesizer]]s as opposed to the band's typical live instrumentation. The band also gained popularity when McCoy was featured in the [[Cobra Starship]] song "[[Snakes on a Plane (Bring It)]]", which was featured on the [[Snakes on a Plane: The Album|soundtrack to the film]].

===2008: ''The Quilt''===
[[File:Gym Class Heroes Warped.jpg|thumb|Gym Class Heroes performing at [[Warped Tour]] on June 20, 2008.]]
After headlining a seven-week U.S. tour called the "[[Daryl Hall]] for President Tour '07", the group returned to the studio to record new material. The resulting material became ''[[The Quilt]]'', which was released on September 9, 2008. The album featured numerous collaborations with other artists, including Daryl Hall (from [[Hall & Oates]]), [[The-Dream]], [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]], and [[Busta Rhymes]]. Guitarist Disashi Lumumba-Kasongo said of the album, "I would definitely say that this is the most collaborative album I've played on with the band. I remember the very first day we started jamming out and working on the songs. I thought, Man, I haven't felt like this since I was in high school jamming out in a garage.

So it's kind of cool, 'cause it was that same feeling, except we were recording for a major album."<ref name="Inked"/> Gym Class Heroes co-headlined the 2008 Warped Tour along with Fueled by Ramen label mates [[Paramore]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1046068/paramore-gym-class-heroes-lead-warped-lineup|title=Paramore, Gym Class Heroes Lead Warped Lineup|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=2010-12-28}}</ref> While the band was performing onstage at the festival on July 2, 2008, Travie McCoy was arrested after hitting a man on the head with his microphone. The man had been in the crowd at a concert in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] when he shouted racial slurs at McCoy.<ref name="RollingStone20080702">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/07/02/gym-class-heroes-singer-arrested-for-assault-after-racial-slur/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704090908/http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/07/02/gym-class-heroes-singer-arrested-for-assault-after-racial-slur/|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 4, 2008|title=Gym Class Heroes Frontman Arrested For Assault After Reacting to Racial Slur|last=Michel|first=Dan|date=2008-07-02|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=2008-07-07}}</ref> McCoy asked the man, "What did you just call me?" As security was removing the man from the venue, McCoy brought the man on stage to call him out in front of the crowd. In a statement, McCoy's publicist said that the man hit McCoy's knee, which was in a brace after he had suffered a recent strain.<ref name="RollingStone20080702" />

===2009–2011: Side projects===
Travie McCoy has pursued a solo career. In 2010, he released a hit single "[[Billionaire (song)|Billionaire]]" with [[Bruno Mars]], which has been successful since its UK release in early May 2010 and also featured in Taio Cruz's single "Higher". He released his first solo album, ''[[Lazarus (Travie McCoy album)|Lazarus]]'', on June 8, 2010. Lumumba-Kasongo created the side-project Soul in 2008, which he has currently been focusing on during Gym Class Heroes' break. The songs "Live a Little" and "No Place Left to Run" from ''The Quilt'' were originally intended to be used strictly for his side project, but McCoy heard the songs and convinced Lumumba-Kasongo to let Gym Class Heroes use the songs.<ref name="Submerge"/> McGinley has been drumming in the rock group [[Kill the Frontman]].<ref name="HipHop">{{cite web|url=http://hiphop.sh/intgym|title=Interview With Gym Class Heroes|last=Nicholson|first=Rip|date=2010-01-20|work=HipHip.sh|access-date=2010-12-29|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728100748/http://hiphop.sh/intgym|archive-date=2011-07-28}}</ref>

===2011–2019: ''The Papercut Chronicles II'' and inactivity===
McCoy had discussed the band's new album, ''[[The Papercut Chronicles II]]'', "We're about 12 demos deep. All I got to say is it's definitely going back to the essence of Gym Class Heroes, which is four dudes sitting in a room, vibing off each other and making organic, dark metal."<ref name="mtv.com">[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1627957/20091209/gym_class_heroes.jhtml Travis McCoy Says Gym Class Heroes Are Getting Back To Basics.] ''MTV News.''</ref> On June 9, 2011, Gym Class Heroes released a song entitled "[[Stereo Hearts]]" which features [[Adam Levine]] from [[Maroon 5]].

On November 20, 2011, Gym Class Heroes performed "[[Stereo Hearts]]" with [[Adam Levine]] on the [[American Music Awards of 2011]]. The video for the fourth single, "Martyrial Girls", premiered on Fueled by Ramen's YouTube channel on August 27, 2012. Following the release of the single, the group ceased activity and entered a hiatus.

In 2018, the band returned to playing live, opening for [[311 (band)|311]] and [[The Offspring]] on their Never Ending Summer Tour. They were set to perform on the Vans Warped Tour 25th Anniversary Show in Atlantic City before abruptly breaking up again.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/KevinLyman/status/1112778257521209349?s=19|title=They broke up Buy Travie will be performing.|last=KevinLyman|date=2019-04-01|website=@KevinLyman|language=en|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref>{{bettersourceneeded|date=March 2020}} In 2019, McCoy stated in an interview that Gym Class Heroes was still on a hiatus, with an uncertain duration.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lifeinthefingerlakes.com/qa-with-travie-mccoy-from-gym-class-heroes/ |title=Q&A WITH TRAVIE MCCOY FROM GYM CLASS HEROES |website=Life In The Finger Lakes |date=September 2019 |access-date=April 23, 2020}}</ref>

==Musical style and influences==
[[AllMusic]] describes them as a "unique alternative-funk-rap outfit" and also states that their sounds melds elements of [[Hip hop music|rap]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], and [[funk]] into one cohesive and melodic sound.<ref name="Allmusic"/> Their sound has also been described as a mix of [[alternative hip hop]] and [[pop-rap]].<ref name="dailycal">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2011/11/16/gym-class-heroes-the-papercut-chronicles-ii/|title=Gym Class Heroes: The Papercut Chronicles II|date=17 November 2011|publisher=dailycal}}</ref> McCoy says of the band's musical style, "We've been the proverbial sore thumb our entire career. Even before we got signed to [[Fueled by Ramen]], we were playing shows with [[death metal]] and hardcore bands and whoever would let us play with them. I wouldn't even consider us a hip-hop band. Musically, it's just all over the place."<ref name="Inked"/> The band acknowledges '80s
funk-influenced R&B acts such as [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[Ready for the World]] as major influences on its sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musicremedy.com/g/gym-class-heroes/album/the-quilt-3366.html|title=Gym Class Heroes to release As Cruel as School Children|last=Leeuwis|first=Jeremy|date=2006-11-01|work=Music Remedy|access-date=2010-12-27}}</ref> Each member draws from different types of music for inspiration, with drummer Matt McGinley saying "there aren’t many [types of music] we agree on."<ref name="Crossfire"/> McCoy cites 1970s [[blue-eyed soul]] group [[Hall & Oates]] as his biggest musical influence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20219996,00.html|title=Travis McCoy Shows Off His Hall & Oates Tattoos|last=Herndon|first=Jessica|date=2008-08-18|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|access-date=2010-12-28}}</ref>

Guitarist Disashi Lumumba-Kasango is mainly influenced by rock music, citing [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Muse (band)|Muse]] as an inspiration for his guitar playing.<ref name="Crossfire"/><ref name="NY Times">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/10/arts/music/10gym.html?hp=&pagewanted=all|title=Following a New Route to Crossover Gold|last=Caramanica|first=Jon|date=2008-09-10|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=2010-12-28}}</ref> Bassist Eric Roberts incorporates elements of [[reggae]] into his playing, as well as styles influenced by metal bands such as [[The Dillinger Escape Plan]] and [[Meshuggah]].<ref name="NY Times"/> McGinley favors funk and rock stylistics inspired by groups such as [[Green Day]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], and [[311 (band)|311]].<ref name="Crossfire"/> Additionally, the band is noted for not using [[Sampling (music)|samples]] in its music, a practice commonly used in hip-hop. McCoy states that "It’s more fun and organic in the live show. There’s definitely a lot of acts that can pull off a DJ/MC thing but then a lot that can’t. Also I guess it’s all we know."<ref name="Crossfire"/> However, ''As Cruel as School Children'' does contain samples, with McGinley commenting, "We’ve always been a band and we never did sampling at all before but within the last couple of years we’ve embraced it more. In the songs we did with Patrick Stump we used it."<ref name="Crossfire"/>
