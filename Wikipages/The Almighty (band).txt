'''The Almighty''' were a [[hard rock]]/[[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band, from [[Glasgow]] in Scotland who formed in 1988. Three of the founding members, [[Ricky Warwick]], Stump Monroe and [[Floyd London]] were friends who met at school.  Although the band members musical roots were in [[punk rock|punk]], The Almighty adopted a more heavy metal/hard rock oriented musical direction in their early years. Later albums saw the band's musical style move towards the band members' original punk roots.

They have released seven studio albums, two anthologies and one live album.

In March 1992 internal differences within the band came to a head causing guitarist Tantrum to leave the band. He was replaced by Canadian [[Pete Friesen]]<ref name="Newsletter8">{{cite web |title=Fan Club Newsletter Issue 8 |url=http://www.thealmighty.co.uk/Newsletters/issue8.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018024205/http://thealmighty.co.uk/Newsletters/issue8.htm |archivedate=18 October 2007 |publisher=The Almighty}}</ref> who had previously played for Alice Cooper,<ref name="almbio2" /> and had met The Almighty when they played support for him the previous year.

===1994–96===
Their fourth album, ''[[Crank (The Almighty album)|Crank]]'', was released on Chrysalis in late 1994. The album saw The Almighty's musical style shift towards the band members original punk roots.<ref name="almbio2" />  They appeared on [[Top of the Pops]] in support of the first single, "Wrench", which reached Number 26 in the UK singles chart.<ref name="Newsletter13">{{cite web |title=Fan Club Newsletter Issue 13 |url=http://www.thealmighty.co.uk/Newsletters/issue13.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017194755/http://thealmighty.co.uk/Newsletters/issue13.htm |archivedate=17 October 2007 |publisher=The Almighty}}</ref>  The second single from the album, "Jonestown Mind", also reached Number 26.<ref name="charts">{{cite web|title=The Almighty|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/25957/ALMIGHTY/|publisher=Official Charts (UK)|accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref>  In the autumn they toured the UK in support of the album and spent seven weeks in Europe supporting [[Pantera]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Athwal |first1=Steve |title=One more for the road |url=http://thealmighty.co.uk/Interviews/Interviews/raw%20(2).html |publisher=Raw |accessdate=24 March 2015 |pages=13–15 |date=December 1994 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018164403/http://thealmighty.co.uk/Interviews/Interviews/raw%20(2).html |archivedate=18 October 2007 }}</ref>  The band returned to tour Europe as headliners in early 1995.<ref name="Newsletter13" /> In May they recorded four tracks for a proposed EP. However, the band decided that the tracks were good enough to form the basis for a fifth album. They therefore decided to arrange two more recording sessions during 1995, recording four tracks each time, so that they would have enough for an album release in 1996.<ref name="Newsletter14">{{cite web |title=Fan Club Newsletter Issue 14 |url=http://www.thealmighty.co.uk/Newsletters/issue14.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017194755/http://thealmighty.co.uk/Newsletters/issue14.htm |archivedate=17 October 2007 |publisher=The Almighty}}</ref>

Their fifth album, ''[[Just Add Life]]'', was released in 1996, with the lead single "All Sussed Out" reaching Number 28 in the UK singles chart.<ref name="tab" /><ref name="charts" />  However, various record company issues and frustrations with the music industry in general saw the band disband later that year.<ref name="tab" />

Ricky Warwick commented about any possible future reunion, saying "I certainly would be open to the idea of doing a few shows. I don’t know how the others feel about it. I love the guys and I love the songs. I would like to play them one day again because life is short and you just get one shot at it".<ref>{{cite web|last=Munro|first=Scott|title=The Almighty reissues unveiled|url=http://teamrock.com/news/2014-12-15/the-almighty-reissues-detailed|website=Team Rock|accessdate=15 December 2014}}</ref>
