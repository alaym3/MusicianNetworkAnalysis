'''Anders''' is a male name in [[Scandinavian languages]] and [[Fering|Fering North Frisian]], an equivalent of the Greek [[Andreas]] ("manly") and the English [[Andrew]]. It originated from [[Andres (name)|Andres]] via [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]].<ref name=isof>{{cite web|title=Anders|url=http://isof.se/sprak/namn/personnamn/dagens-namn-i-almanackan/kalender/namnsdagar/namnkalender/2013-11-01-anders.html|website=[[Swedish Institute for Language and Folklore]]|language=sv|access-date=30 November 2019}}</ref>

In Sweden, Anders has been one of the most common names for many centuries, earliest attested in 1378. It was common for priests and farmers during medieval times.<ref name=isof/> According to [[Statistics Sweden]], as of December 31, 2002, it ranks 4th among the male names. The great frequency of this name at the point in time (around 1900) when [[patronymic]]s were converted into [[family name]]s is the reason why 1 out of every 30 Swedes today is called [[Andersson]].

The [[Name days in Sweden|name day]] of Anders in the Scandinavian calendar is November 30,<ref name=isof/> and in the old peasant superstition that day was important for determining what the [[Christmas]] weather would be. If it was very cold on November 30, there would be much [[Rain and snow mixed|sleet]] on Christmas (and vice versa).{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

In Denmark (but not in Norway or Sweden), [[Donald Duck]]'s name is ''Anders And''.

The [[Föhr North Frisian|Fering]] name Anders may have been borrowed from the Danish version.<ref name=Faltings>{{cite book|editor-first=Volkert F. |editor-last=Faltings |title=Kleine Namenkunde für Föhr und Amrum |trans-title=A little Etymology for Föhr and Amrum |location=Hamburg |publisher=Helmut Buske |year=1985 |language=German |isbn=3-87118-680-5 |page=38}}</ref>
