The band's debut album ''[[Prophets (album)|Prophets]]'' was released 23 February 2010 on label Verona Records.

===''The Current Will Carry Us'' (2011−2012)===
In spring of 2011, the band was signed to [[Victory Records]].  The band continued to tour until the summer of 2011, when they announced that they were recording a new album.<ref name="punknews.org_The Current Will Carry Us"/> During this time, Needham left the band to see a speech therapist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150238330055000|title=Important July Update (MUST READ)|accessdate=12 June 2015}}</ref> A search for their next drummer was started, but ultimately, Juntilla rejoined the band, just in time to start recording for their second album, ''The Current Will Carry Us''. ''The Current Will Carry Us'' was released 24 October 2011 on Victory.<ref name="worldcat.org_The Current Will Carry Us"/> A music video was released for the song "Jumping Ship".<ref name="aquarian.com"/><ref name="punknews.org_Jumping Ship"/>

Music critic Andrew Kelham, of ''[[Rock Sound]]'' magazine, gave a rating of 8 to the album.  He called it "brilliant" and stated that ''The Current Will Carry Us'' "is a great first impression for the many who are yet to become acquainted with the Canadian melodic-yet-frenetic hardcore quintet."<ref name="rocksound.tv_The Current Will Carry Us"/> Kiel Hume of ''[[Exclaim!]]'' magazine writes that Counterparts have the energy, talent, and attitude to wake up the genre.  He states:  "''The Current Will Carry Us'' basically does that to a genre many people thought was on its last breath."<ref name="exclaim.ca_The Current Will Carry Us"/>

Kyle Brownlee, formerly of Canadian deathcore band Majesty, filled in for Juntilla for the entirety of the band's Canadian headliner tour, later on in summer of 2012, it was announced that Juntilla departed from Counterparts because he no longer wanted to be a part of the band.

Shortly afterwards, the guitarist of Kills and Thrills, Brian Kaczmarczyk, joined on bass, becoming the only non-Canadian member of the band.

===''You're Not You Anymore'' (2017−present)===

''You're Not You Anymore'' was the first recorded effort without the participation of Doreen due to his departure from Counterparts. The band did not let lineup changes derail their creativity and spirits.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://killyourstereo.com/reviews/1096793/counterparts-you%E2%80%99re-not-you-anymore/|title=Counterparts' You're Not You Anymore Review|website=Killyoustereo|date=2017-09-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uncivilrevolt.com/2017/09/album-review-counterparts-youre-not-anymore/|title=Album Review: Counterparts' Yon're Not You|website=Uncivil Revolt|date=2017-09-26}}</ref> Playing an important role in the modern [[melodic hardcore]] scene, their new album is considered to have a different set of influences and a more refined sound. [[Odyssey (publication)|Odyssey]] states: "The rawness of [[Poison the Well (band)|Poison The Well]]'s and [[Misery Signal]]'s technical but absolutely emotionally devastating take on [[metalcore]] are influences they wear on their sleeve, tied together with the tortured poetry of Brendan Murphy’s lyrics."<ref name="odyssey">{{cite web|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/7-metalcore-revival-bands|title=7 Metalcore Revival Bands You Need To Know About|publisher=odyssey|date=26 October 2017}}</ref>

''Nothing Left to Love'' was the band's first record to break into the top 100 of the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] 200 charts, peaking at 97.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200/2019-11-16?rank=97|title=Billboard 200 Chart|date=16 November 2019|accessdate=9 April 2021}}</ref>
