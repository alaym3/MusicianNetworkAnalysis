'''Cornershop''' are a British [[indie rock]] band best known for their single "[[Brimful of Asha]]", originally released in 1997 and, in a remixed version, topping the UK chart in 1998. The band was formed in 1991 by [[Wolverhampton]]-born Tjinder Singh (singer, songwriter, and guitar), his brother Avtar Singh (bass guitar, vocals), David Chambers (drums) and Ben Ayres (guitar, keyboards, and [[Tanpura (instrument)|tamboura]]), the first three having previously been members of [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]]-based band General Havoc, who released one single (the "Fast Jaspal EP") in 1991.<ref name="Strong">{{Cite book |last=Strong |first=Martin C. |title=The Great Alternative & Indie Discography |year=1999 |publisher=Canongate |isbn=0-86241-913-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/greatalternative0000stro }}</ref><ref name="Buckley">Buckley, Peter (2003) ''The Rough Guide to Rock'', [[Rough Guides]], {{ISBN|978-1-84353-105-0}}, p.229-230</ref> The band name originated from a stereotype referring to [[British Asian]]s often owning [[convenience store|corner shops]]. Their music is a [[fusion (music)|fusion]] of [[Music of India|Indian music]], [[indie rock]], alternative and [[electronic dance music]].

==History==
===Formation and early years: 1991–1996===
Tjinder Singh formed the General Havoc whilst a student at [[University of Central Lancashire|Lancashire Polytechnic]] in Preston, in 1987.<ref name="Strong" /> He relocated to Leicester, where his brother and sister lived, and formed Cornershop in 1991 along with his brother Avtar, and Chambers and Ayres, while working as a barman at Leicester's Magazine pub, also a popular local music venue.<ref name="lb">{{Cite web|url=https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/?WCI=SiteHome&ID=8354&PageID=44919|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009045007/http://beehive.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/default.asp?WCI=SiteHome&ID=8354&PageID=44919|url-status=dead|title=Leicestershire Live - Latest local news, sport & business from Leicester|archive-date=9 October 2006|website=Leicestermercury.co.uk}}</ref> The band played their first gig at Leicester's ''O'Jays'' venue.<ref name="lb" />
In the early 1990s, when singer [[Morrissey]] was being vilified by the UK music press after accusations of racism, the band were invited to comment and the ''Melody Maker'' ran a story featuring the band burning a picture of the singer outside the offices of [[EMI]].<ref name="Beaujon">Beaujon, Andrew (1996) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=3ywEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT16 Cornershop: Bhangra Punk!]", ''[[CMJ New Music Monthly]]'', February 1996, p. 20.</ref>

Their debut release, the ''In The Days of Ford Cortina EP'', was pressed on "curry-coloured vinyl"<ref name="Buckley" /><ref name="Larkin">Larkin, Colin (1998) ''The Virgin Encyclopedia of Indie & New Wave'', Virgin Books, {{ISBN|0-7535-0231-3}}, p.99-100</ref> and contained a blend of Indian-tinged noise pop. The sound mellowed somewhat with the release of debut album ''[[Hold On It Hurts]]'' in 1994, described by ''[[Trouser Press]]'' as "a politically charged popfest, ten tracks of noisy delights that meld incisive social commentary with a firm hold on British post-punk."<ref name="McCaleb">McCaleb, Ian & Reno, Brad "[http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=cornershop Cornershop]", ''[[Trouser Press]]''</ref> The album impressed [[David Byrne]] sufficiently for him to sign the band to his [[Luaka Bop]] label.<ref name="Buckley" /> Although David Chambers left the band in 1994, replaced by Nick Simms, the band re-emerged in 1995 with the "6 a.m. Jullandar Shere" single and the album ''[[Woman's Gotta Have It]]'', also touring the United States including some dates on the [[Lollapalooza]] tour.<ref name="Buckley" /> The band also toured Europe with [[Beck]], [[Stereolab]] and [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]].<ref name="Buckley" />

===Mainstream success: 1997–2001===
The band released their critically acclaimed album ''[[When I Was Born for the 7th Time]]'' in September 1997. The album featured collaborations with [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Paula Frazer]], [[Justin Warfield]] and a [[Yoko Ono]]- and [[Paul McCartney]]-approved cover of "[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)|Norwegian Wood]]" recorded in the [[Punjabi language]]. The album was produced by Tjinder Singh and [[Dan the Automator]]. Rolling Stone called it one of the essential recordings of the 1990s. The album was ranked No.&nbsp;1 on Spin's list of 'Top 20 Albums of the Year' (1998)

The track "Brimful of Asha" topped the legendary Festive 50 rundown of [[John Peel]]'s tracks of the year in 1997.

[[Norman Cook]] (a.k.a. Fatboy Slim) loved the track and remixed the song, which became hugely popular and captured the attention of the world. The song was a tribute to the prolific Indian [[playback singer]], [[Asha Bhosle]], and Tjinder's musical influences such as [[Trojan Records]] and vinyl culture in general.

In 2000 Ayres and Singh released a [[disco]] inspired album ''Disco and the Halfway to Discontent'' as part of their side-project, Clinton. This album inspired the launch of the London-based clubnight called [[Buttoned Down Disco]], which took its name from the third track on the album.

===Further success: 2002–2010===
Their next official Cornershop release was the 2002 album, ''[[Handcream for a Generation]]'', which featured [[Noel Gallagher]] on guitar.<ref name="Buckley" />

According to their official website, Cornershop have been making a film about London's independent music industry since 2003. In 2004 the band released the track 'Topknot' featuring the vocals of Bubbley Kaur on Rough Trade Records. In February 2006, some four years after their last album, they released another single "Wop the Groove" featuring guest vocals from [[Happy Mondays]] backing singer [[Rowetta]].

In 2008, their song "Candyman" was featured in the Nike advertisement for the LeBron James VI shoe, called the Six "Chalk" commercial.

Cornershop released an album ''[[Judy Sucks a Lemon for Breakfast]]'' in July 2009, preceded by the single "The Roll-Off Characteristics (Of History in the Making)" in May on their own record label called Ample Play.

===Recent years: 2011–present===
In 2011, Cornershop were awarded a prize for Commitment to Scene in the [[UK Asian Music Awards]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.desiblitz.com/content/2011-uk-asian-music-awards-winners |title=2011 UK Asian Music Awards Winners |author=Jas Sembhi|date=10 March 2011 |work=desiblitz.com |access-date=13 March 2011}}</ref>

An album ''[[Cornershop and the Double 'O' Groove Of]]'', a collaboration with Punjabi folk singer [[Bubbley Kaur]], was released in March 2011 to critical acclaim in the UK. The band also set up the Singhles Club Club, a subscription service featuring a series of musically diverse collaborations and exclusive digital artwork.

The band's eighth album ''[[Urban Turban]]'' was released on 14 May 2012 and the ninth album ''[[Hold On It's Easy]]'' was released on 2 February 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/cornershop/62508 |title=Cornershop announce new album 'Urban Turban' |website=Nme.com |date=8 March 2012 |access-date=1 April 2012}}</ref> In July 2015 they released a single "Pinpoint" with Welsh singer Angharad Van Rijswijk aka Accü <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwqRPY8sY7g|title=Cornerhop ft. Accü 'Pinpoint' - ample play records|date=8 July 2015|access-date=13 July 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

In 2017 they gave an instrumental track called 'Demon is a Monster' to the anti-Brexit podcast '[[Remainiacs]]' to use as a theme tune.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://audioboom.com/posts/6322028-the-one-with-gina-miller | title=The one with Gina Miller | date=22 September 2017 | website=Audioboom.com | access-date=25 April 2018 }}</ref> The track was then released digitally.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNkURpQNjLY|title=CORNERSHOP 'Demon is a Monster' Remainiacs Podcast theme tune - Ample Play Records|date=24 November 2017|access-date=13 July 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> Cornershop were fiercely anti-Brexit.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Wyatt|first=Malcolm|title=No Looking Back for Cornershop as their Music Continues to Develop|date=20 February 2020|work=Lancashire Evening Post}}</ref> In March 2020, they released a new album, ''England is a Garden'' to generally positive reviews.
