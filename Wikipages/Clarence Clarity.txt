'''Adam Mark Crisp''' (born c. 1985), known by the [[stage name]] '''Clarence Clarity''', is an English singer, songwriter, producer, and musician.<ref name=Guardian>{{cite web|title=Clarence Clarity (No 35)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/12/clarence-clarity-no-35|website=The Guardian|accessdate=26 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402182230/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/12/clarence-clarity-no-35|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> He has been praised for his unique, eclectic pop sound which was described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as "funk played by a swarm of bees",<ref name=Guardian/> and is noted for his high degree of anonymity regarding his life outside of making music. Despite the similarity, Crisp has stated that his stage name was not overtly influenced by the meme template 'Sudden Clarity Clarence'.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S0MuQKZkAY] {{dead link|date=February 2021}}</ref>

His first release under the name 'Clarence Clarity' was ''4GODSLUV''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqk2m9ZOWow|title=4GODSLUV|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=7 February 2021}}</ref> in 2012,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://diymag.com/2014/12/11/clarence-clarity-interview-class-of-2015|title=Clarence Clarity: The man, the mystery|last=Subscribe|website=DIY|language=en|access-date=2019-02-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190209232416/http://diymag.com/2014/12/11/clarence-clarity-interview-class-of-2015|archive-date=9 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>  and he subsequently released his debut EP ''Save †hyself'' on the [[37 Adventures]] label in late 2013. At this point in his career, Crisp promoted an air of anonymity around the project, preferring not to refer to his previous work and giving false and absurd information in press releases, such as rumours that he was from [[Fiji]] or that his music was a new [[Jai Paul]] project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_au/article/xwd4vj/2-4-6-8-we-appreciate-clarence-clarity|title=2, 4, 6, 8… we appreciate clarence clarity|last=Dunn|first=Francesca|date=2015-02-19|website=I-D|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-02-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190212011234/https://i-d.vice.com/en_au/article/xwd4vj/2-4-6-8-we-appreciate-clarence-clarity|archive-date=12 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Clarence Clarity">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/new-music/introducing/clarence-clarity-142249|title=Clarence Clarity|website=The Line of Best Fit|language=en|access-date=2019-02-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627204557/https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/new-music/introducing/clarence-clarity-142249|archive-date=27 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> When asked about this by ''[[The Guardian]]'', he replied with "I've got a musical history, and I suppose I don't want to have to justify why certain things in the past haven't taken off.

In December 2014, Clarity released his second EP, ''Who Am Eye'', now on the [[Bella Union]] label. The album cover features his face with a distorted mouth and removed some more of the anonymity behind the project.<ref name="Clarence Clarity"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/news/latest-news/clarence-clarity-announces-who-am-eye-ep-streams-first-track|title=Clarence Clarity announces WHO AM EYE EP, streams first track|website=The Line of Best Fit|language=en|access-date=2019-02-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627211604/https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/news/latest-news/clarence-clarity-announces-who-am-eye-ep-streams-first-track|archive-date=27 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In March 2015, he released his first full-length album, ''[[No Now]]'', and also performed a session at [[Maida Vale Studios]] for [[Huw Stephens]] on [[BBC Radio 1]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://diymag.com/2015/03/25/clarence-clarity-plays-maida-vale-session|title=Clarence Clarity plays Maida Vale session for Radio 1|last=Subscribe|website=DIY|language=en|access-date=2019-02-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811195520/http://diymag.com/2015/03/25/clarence-clarity-plays-maida-vale-session|archive-date=11 August 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2016, Clarence released a single with Pizza Boy, "Splitting Hairs", and the ''SAME EP'', which consists of the titular track "SAME" repeated 5 times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.soundcloud.com/clarence-clarity/sets/same-ep|title=SAME EP - Clarence Clarity|website=SoundCloud.com|language=en|access-date=2019-02-10}}</ref>
