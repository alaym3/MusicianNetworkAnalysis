In February 2007, Barrino appeared and performed on ''American Idol'', and announced that she would be starring in the lead role of Celie in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[The Color Purple (musical)|The Color Purple]]'', the hit musical based on the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[The Color Purple|1982 novel of the same name]] by [[Alice Walker]].

Leading up to her first performance on April 10, 2007, the play garnered a total of 6.5&nbsp;million in pre-ticket sales.

While playing the role, Barrino earned rave reviews for her performance. ''[[New York Post]]'' critic [[Clive Barnes (critic)|Clive Barnes]] said, "... there is some elemental quality to Barrino that is either greatness or something close to it." Upon her warm welcome to the stage Barrino was asked to perform at the [[61st Tony Awards|2007 Tony Awards]] in a tribute to [[Atlanta]]'s [[Alliance Theater]] in which ''The Color Purple'' got its start. In recognition of an outstanding stage debut performance, Barrino was given the [[Theatre World Award]] and the Best Replacement Star Broadway.com Award. Barrino was initially scheduled for a limited six-month engagement ending in October 2007 but had her run extended until January 6, 2008. ''The Color Purple'' box office saw a thirty-four-million-dollar jump in sales since Barrino started in the show, a third of the play's 100 million dollar earning since its debut in 2005. The ''New York Post'' reported that Barrino missed nearly fifty performances in the show, causing the producers to give back tens of thousands of dollars in refunds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/12122007/entertainment/theater/fantasias_purple_flu_453359.htm|title=Fantasia's 'Purple' Flu|work=New York Post|date=December 12, 2007|access-date=March 9, 2015}}</ref> In the September 2008 issue of ''[[Sister 2 Sister]]'' magazine, Barrino revealed that the reason for her absences in ''The Color Purple'' was because of the development of a cyst on her [[vocal folds|vocal cords]]. She was ordered to immediately undergo surgery which later revealed that she in fact had a tumor on her vocal cords. She now reports that after a successful surgery, the tumor was completely removed and she is now well.<ref>[http://www.s2smagazine.com/content/content.asp?issueid=200809&listid=14] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904150802/http://www.s2smagazine.com/content/content.asp?issueid=200809&listid=14|date=September 4, 2008}}</ref>

Barrino received two Grammy nominations for her sophomore release, ''Fantasia'' and subsequently began work on her third studio album in 2008. She stated on the red carpet of the [[2008 Grammy Awards]] that the style of the new album would be a blending of the avenues she has touched musically, which include ''American Idol'' and Broadway.

In 2019, Barrino came under fire when, in an interview on ''[[The Breakfast Club (radio show)|The Breakfast Club]]'' radio show, she claimed that women were not to lead their household and that the reason so many women were single is because they're trying to be the leader of a relationship, a position that should fall to the man, calling it a "[[generational curse]]" and saying women should submit to their male partners.<ref>{{Cite web|publisher=[[YouTube]]|title=Fantasia tell WOMEN to submit to MAN, and stop tryin to be the leader in the relationship FOLLOW HIM|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QV3C6vmT-l0|access-date=September 22, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bet.com/style/living/2019/09/18/do-women-need-to-be-more-submissive-in-relationships-.html?cid=facebook|title=Fantasia Says She Believes Women Are Single Because They Can't Submit To Men, Do You?|website=BET.com|access-date=September 22, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newsone.com/playlist/fantasia-submit-to-their-man/|title=Fantasia Gets Backlash For Saying Women Need To 'Submit' To Their Man|date=September 19, 2019|website=News One|access-date=September 22, 2019}}</ref>

== Artistry ==
=== Voice ===
Barrino's voice has been described as raspy, gritty and soulful.<ref>{{cite news|title=Barrino family believes fame was inevitable|url=http://www.today.com/id/5006903/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/barrino-family-believes-fame-was-inevitable/|access-date=November 21, 2014|work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=May 25, 2004}}</ref>

=== Influences ===
Barrino has said from childhood she has been influenced by soul singers [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Patti LaBelle]], [[Chaka Khan]] and [[Tina Turner]], as well as jazz singers [[Billie Holiday]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Cab Calloway]] and [[Nina Simone]]. Barrino has drawn many comparisons to her idols. LaBelle affectionately calls Barrino "baby Patti". "[Fantasia's] just a baby me...when you see yourself in someone else, you say, 'God I'm 70, she's 30,' so she's like the Patti Labelle from back in the day and everything and she's so raw", LaBelle stated in an interview.<ref>{{cite web|last=Witherspoon |first=Chris |url=http://thegrio.com/2014/06/13/patti-labelle-broadway-depression-voice |title=Patti LaBelle triumphs on Broadway after battling depression and losing voice |website=TheGrio.com |date=June 13, 2014 |access-date=December 9, 2015}}</ref> She always credit her church upbringing and cites [[The Clark Sisters]] as one of her influences. Barrino is also an admirer of rock music and was influenced by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and [[Elton John]]. Her fourth album, [[Side Effects of You]] introduced a new and much edgier rock-inspired sound which she coined as 'rock soul'. During an interview with [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]].com, Barrino has stated that she would like to go in more of a rock direction for her fifth studio album. "This whole rock soul direction has been on my heart. I'll always be soulful: I started singing in the church at the age of five. So that will never go anywhere. But there's a certain side of me that wants to tap into that whole rock world. It's hard to come from R&B to that. But it's something I believe in and will fight for", Barrino said in the interview.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Gail Mitchell |url=https://billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6121607/fantasia-fifth-album-after-midnight-rock-soul-interview |title=Fantasia Begins Work on Fifth Album, Talks Rock Music & 'After Midnight' |magazine=Billboard |date=June 18, 2014 |access-date=December 9, 2015}}</ref>

=== Genres ===
Barrino's music is mostly [[contemporary R&B]], heavily rooted in [[soul music]] and [[gospel music]]. Her lyrics speak of love, pain and resilience.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rosen|first=Jody|title=Jody Rosen's Top 10 Best Pop Albums of 2013|url=https://www.vulture.com/2013/12/10-best-pop-albums-of-the-year/|website=Vulture.com|date=December 3, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106160459/http://www.vulture.com/2013/12/10-best-pop-albums-of-the-year/|archive-date=January 6, 2016}}</ref> She also incorporates pop, [[funk]], [[reggae]] and [[hip hop]] into her music.

== Legacy ==
Since winning ''[[American Idol]]'' in 2004, Barrino has sold over three million records and won numerous awards and accolades, including a [[Grammy Award]], three [[Billboard Awards]], three [[NAACP Image Awards]] and two [[ASCAP Awards]].
