She has won three [[Academy Awards]] for the final film of the trilogy, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''.

==Early life==
Walsh was born into a family of Irish descent<ref name=":0"/> in [[Wellington]], New Zealand. She attended [[Wellington Girls' College]] intent on becoming a fashion designer, but eventually became interested in music instead. Occasionally taking time off to perform in a [[punk music|punk]] band named The Wallsockets, she attended [[Victoria University of Wellington]] majoring in [[English literature]] and graduating in 1981.<ref name=":0"/>

==Career==
Walsh got her screen break writing material for New Zealand producer Grahame McLean on 1983 television film ''A Woman of Good Character (It's Lizzie to those Close)''. Later she wrote scripts for his TV show ''[[Worzel Gummidge Down Under]]''.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/movies/middle-earth-wizards-not-so-silent-partner.html|title=Middle-Earth Wizard's Not-So-Silent Partner|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|date=2012-11-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-03|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Walsh met Peter Jackson in the mid-1980s during the final stages of production on his low-budget movie ''[[Bad Taste]]'', in which aliens serve humans as fast food.<ref name=":0" /> Walsh has collaborated with Jackson on the scripts of all his subsequent films, after joining the writing quartet on his next film, the [[dark comedy]] ''[[Meet the Feebles]]'' (1989).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Formats and Editions of Meet the Feebles [WorldCat.org]|language=en|oclc = 123093764}}</ref> The couple then reteamed with writer [[Stephen Sinclair]] on the [[horror film|horror]]-comedy film that they had begun writing before Feebles, the zombie movie ''[[Braindead (1992 movie)|Braindead]]'' (retitled ''Dead Alive'' in the United States, 1992).<ref>{{Citation|last1=Jackson|first1=Peter|title=Dead alive.|date=2004|last2=Walsh|last3=Balme|last4=Peñalver|last5=Moody|last6=Dasent|first2=Fran|first3=Tim|first4=Diana|first5=Elizabeth|first6=Peter|oclc=890284207}}</ref>

Walsh and Jackson have not married (2015).<ref name=":0"/> They explored new ground with the drama ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]'' (1994). The film that was Walsh's idea<ref name=":0"/> was based on the friendship of the [[Parker-Hulme murder case|Parker-Hulme]] teenagers, who infamously later killed one of their mothers. The film earned the duo an Oscar nomination for the screenplay. Walsh gave birth to Billy in 1995 and Katie in 1996. They returned to a more familiar genre with [[Universal Studios]] horror-comedy ''[[The Frighteners]]'' (1996), their first film funded by an American studio.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} They were in talks with Universal to remake ''[[King Kong]]'' until 1998's ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]'' and ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1998 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]'' were first announced, and Universal decided against the film. Universal feared it would be thrown aside by the two higher budget movies.<ref>{{cite book|url={{Google books|UPXbsJLVgCcC|page=168|plainurl=yes}}|title=King Kong: The History of a Movie Icon from Fay Wray to Peter Jackson|last=Morton|first=Ray|page=168}}</ref> Wanting to try his hand at [[fantasy film|fantasy]], Jackson turned to [[Miramax]] to make a film based on the works of writer [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. In 1998, [[New Line Cinema]] provided the necessary financial backing to make a three-part adaptation of Tolkien's classic ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Patrick Goldstein |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/aug/24/entertainment/ca-15963 |title=New Line Gambles on Becoming Lord of the 'Rings' |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=24 August 1998 |access-date=24 March 2016}}</ref>

Walsh, with Jackson and [[Philippa Boyens]], is credited for writing the screenplays for [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]] (2001&ndash;2003) (Stephen Sinclair has a writing credit on second film ''The Two Towers''). They shared many awards, including an [[76th Academy Awards|Oscar]] for their [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|adapted screenplay]] for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''. She also was one of the film's producers and co-composer of two songs for ''Return of the King'', namely "[[Into the West (song)|Into the West]]"<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

Walsh, Jackson, and Boyens continued their screenplay work together for the 2005 remake of ''[[King Kong (2005 movie)|King Kong]]'', which was given the [[green-light|green light]] by Universal after the Rings trilogy's success. The couple collaborated on the adaptation of the novel ''[[The Lovely Bones]]'' and on the three-film adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit]]''.<ref name=":0"/>

Walsh prefers to remain more private than Jackson or Boyens; she did not contribute an interview to the bonus features on ''The Lord of the Rings'' movie DVDs; however, she did feature on the director/writers' [[Audio commentary (DVD)|commentary]] (where she and Jackson discussed that they felt one of them should remain a private figure for the good of their family). Her vocals were used as a significant part of the screech of the [[Nazgûl]] in the films.<ref>{{cite AV media
