'''Wheatus''' are an American rock band from [[Northport, New York]], formed in 1995. They are [[One hit wonder|known principally]] for their 2000 single "[[Teenage Dirtbag]]", which appeared in the films ''[[Loser (film)|Loser]]'' and ''[[Bully (2011 film)|Bully]]'', as well as  the [[HBO]] miniseries ''[[Generation Kill (TV series)|Generation Kill]]'', the Netflix original series ''[[Girlboss]]'', and ''[[The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina (TV series)|The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina]]''.

==Origins==
Brendan B. Brown, commonly known as ''BBB'' to fans, is the lead vocalist, guitarist, and the only remaining founding member of Wheatus, which he formed in 1995 with his brother, Peter Brown (drums) and Rich Liegey (bass).<ref name="Ruhlmann">{{cite web  | url={{AllMusic| class=artist| id=p437024| pure_url=yes}}| title=Biography: Wheatus| last=Ruhlmann| first=William| publisher=[[AllMusic]]| access-date=July 1, 2010}}</ref>  Brown has also collaborated with [[James Bourne]] of [[Busted (band)|Busted]] and [[McBusted]] (a collaboration between Busted and [[McFly]]) on several songs for McBusted's album, ''[[McBusted (album)|McBusted]]''.

==History==

===1995–2002: Formation and ''Wheatus''===
Wheatus was formed by Brendan B. Brown in 1995, on the lower east side of New York City. Brown began by writing a few songs, and subsequently enlisted the help of his brother Peter Brown on drums, Rich Liegey on bass and backing vocals and Philip A. Jimenez on various percussion instruments, keyboards, harmonica, providing samples and special effects. The band derives its name from the nickname "wedus" given to the Brown brothers by their father when they were children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amiright.com/names/origins/w.shtml |title=Band Name Origins -> W |access-date=2015-09-06}}</ref> Then, in 1999 they hired New York entertainment attorney Ray Maiello who booked them at the Luna Lounge on New York's [[Lower East Side]] for regular appearances. Maiello helped the group and shopped their self-produced debut album to major record labels.  Maiello sent demos to Kevin Patrick from [[Columbia Records]]. Maiello invited Patrick to see a showcase at [[Mercury Lounge]] and Patrick quickly signed the band to a multi-album deal. Maiello was subsequently hired as the band's manager. Their self-titled debut album was released on August 15, 2000 and spawned the band's first and largest hit, "Teenage Dirtbag", a song which charted at No. 1 in Australia and No. 2 in the United Kingdom. Their second single, a cover of one of [[Erasure (band)|Erasure]]'s signature songs – "[[A Little Respect]]", also reached very high chart positions, peaking at No. 3 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/wheatus/8428 |title=Jolly Roger! &#124; News |publisher=Nme.Com |date=2001-07-03 |access-date=2012-04-29}}</ref> The third single from the album, a double A-side of "Leroy" and "Wannabe Gangstar", didn't perform as well as expected, only reaching No. 23 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Another song from the album, "Punk Ass Bitch", was bought by the creators of ''[[Jackie Chan Adventures]]'' and reworked as "Chan's the Man", the end credits theme for the program's first season.

===2002–2005: ''Hand Over Your Loved Ones'' and ''Suck Fony''===
The band began work on their second album in the summer of 2002, with Brendan enlisting the help of his sister, Liz Brown, and the band's merchandiser, Kathryn Froggatt, as backing vocalists. Shannon Harris of [[Relish (band)|Relish]], a band who had previously supported Wheatus on their earlier tours, was also added to the band as keyboardist. The album's first single, "American in Amsterdam", was heavily underpromoted after the band had a dispute with their record label over their request to lip sync on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} When their second studio album, ''[[Hand Over Your Loved Ones]]'', was released in Autumn 2003, it received little or no promotion in the United Kingdom, and was never released in the United States due to the ongoing dispute.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In October 2004, the band made the decision to part with their record label, and as such, formed their own record label, [[Montauk Mantis]]. During this time, they also enlisted Michael Bellar as a replacement for Shannon Harris, who had decided to leave the band over the dispute. In February 2005, the band re-released ''Hand Over Your Loved Ones'' under the new title ''[[Suck Fony]]''. For the re-release, the album included new songs, including the new track "William McGovern", and a cover of the [[Pat Benatar]] classic "Hit Me with Your Best Shot". The album was originally only made available via the band's website, until 2007, when it was added to iTunes and Amazon MP3 after the band signed a distribution contract.

===2005–2007: Line-up changes and ''Too Soon Monsoon''===
Bassist Mike McCabe left the band in March 2005, shortly after the release of ''Suck Fony''. He was subsequently replaced by Nicolas diPierro. The band subsequently began recording a new album in April 2005, and just three months later, the album's first single, ''BMX Bandits'', was released as a limited edition 7" single. In October 2005, the band's third studio album, ''Too Soon Monsoon'', was released via their official website. Since early 2010, ''[[Too Soon Monsoon]]'' has been made available via a "[[pay what you want]]" donation scheme via the band's official website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wheatus.com/main_index.html|title=Wheatus Official Website. Retrieved on March 3, 2010|access-date=January 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309103408/http://www.wheatus.com/main_index.html|archive-date=March 9, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Days after the release, Michael Bellar decided to leave the band, and was replaced by Gerard Hoffmann. A second single from the album, ''The London Sun'', was released in February 2006, however, the release marked the departure of Nicolas diPierro, who was subsequently replaced by 19-year-old rookie bassist Matt Milligan. A further line-up changed occurred in May 2006 when drummer Pete Brown decided to give up being a musician to get married.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wheatus.com/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&t=3666|title=bbbsays: Pete|work=Wheatus' official forum|first=Brendan|last=Brown|access-date=May 3, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928172155/http://www.wheatus.com/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&t=3666|archive-date=September 28, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> He was subsequently replaced by Kevin Garcia, leaving Brendan Brown as the only remaining member from the original line-up. The next line-up change occurred only five days later, when Kathryn Froggatt left the band due to pregnancy. She later turned her hand to a new band project, entitled Amberlove. Kathryn was replaced by Connie Renda, however, she subsequently changed her mind, and was subsequently replaced by Missy Heselton. In February 2007, Wheatus joined the UK leg of the Get Happy Tour, along with founders [[Bowling for Soup]] and [[Army of Freshmen]] and British [[pop-punk]] outfit [[Son of Dork]], for a sold out 13 show tour. The tour sparked the departure of Liz Brown, who decided to return to her original line of work in New York. Missy Heselton also took a back step from vocal duties to concentrate on studying.

===2008–2012: ''Pop, Songs & Death''===
The band began recording new material in October 2007. The material's release was carried over until February 2008, when a video for the song "Real Girl" was released to YouTube. The video was written, directed and filmed by Brendan, with assistance from Heselton and Milligan. On February 3, the band made an announcement claiming that the material they had been recording would be available to purchase in the fourth quarter of 2008.<ref>http://www.wheatus.com/ ''Wheatus Official Website. Retrieved on February 5, 2008''</ref> In March 2008, the band performed several tour dates in the United States, and also announced dates for an acoustic performance in the United Kingdom. In October 2008, the band completed a successful tour of the UK, during which some of the new material was showcased in an acoustic form. In November 2008, the band returned to the recording studio to perfect their new material, and thus, set a release date for a six-track EP, entitled ''Pop, Songs & Death, Vol 1: The Lightning EP''. In early 2009, Brendan composed music for motion picture ''[[April Showers (2009 film)|April Showers]]'', a film which deals directly with the [[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine Massacre]]. On June 1, 2009, ''The Lightning EP'' was expected for release; however, it was not available until June 2 due to a series of technical difficulties, including a server crash on their website. In January 2010, Wheatus began a worldwide theater tour, with dates spanning the United States, United Kingdom and [[Austria]]. They were supported by [[nerdcore]] rapper [[MC Frontalot]]. In April 2010, Brown announced via his official Twitter page that ''Pop, Songs & Death, Vol. 2: The Jupiter EP'' was scheduled for release in May 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/wheatus/status/11311747039|title=@ralasinchains gonna be May 1  almost finished w it.... ;- )|last=wheatus|date=March 30, 2010|access-date=January 18, 2018}}</ref> However, the released was pushed back to December 23, 2010.

In November 2012, the EPs were released together as the band's fourth studio album, ''Pop, Songs and Death''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blacktoprecords.weebly.com/catalogue.html|title=Catalogue|work=Blacktop Records}}</ref>

===2012–2014: ''The Valentine LP''===
Following a re-release of the single "Lemonade", supported by the first of three Lego videos created by Oliver Broadbent, the band released their fifth studio album, ''The Valentine LP'' in 2013. The album is described a set of "post-apocalyptic love songs", according to Brown.<ref name=GPinterview>{{cite web|url=https://www.goldenplec.com/featured/brendan-b-brown-wheatus-interview/|title=Brendan B Brown of Wheatus - Interview - Feature|date=31 August 2013|website=Goldenplec.com|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref> Brown claimed that he delved into the concept of "reconstituting society, fighting zombies, and trying to maintain some kind of romantic relationship at the same time.",<ref name=GPinterview/> whilst the album's sound is reminiscent of 1970s-era [[The Who]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]] and [[AC/DC]].<ref name=GPinterview/>

An album sampler was released on [[YouTube]] on July 27, 2013, while full tracks from the record were uploaded between August 14 and September 9.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/WheatusOfficial/videos|title=WheatusOfficial|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref> The album was released on August 2, 2013 as digital download ([[mp3]] and [[FLAC]]) through the band's website,<ref name=Pmagreview>{{cite web|url=https://www.previousmagazine.com/wheatus-the-valentine-lp-review|title=Wheatus - The Valentine LP Review|date=15 August 2013|website=Previousmagazine.com|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref> with a vinyl version shipping in late 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wheatus.com/home|title=Wheatus|website=Wheatus.com|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref> The digital version of the album includes a [[PDF]] entitled "Valentine Comic", with concept art for the album, depicting a zombie apocalypse love story.

He was replaced by William Tully.

Following the album's release, the band recorded a new single, "Only You", a collaboration with two members of [[One Direction]]'s band, bassist Sandy Beales and drummer [[Josh Devine]].<ref name=OYsleeve>{{cite AV media notes|title=Only You |others=Wheatus |year=2014 |type=Sleeve |publisher= Montauk Mantis Productions |id=CDMMR1P}}</ref> The single was released on July 6, 2014.<ref name=OYsleeve/> The collaboration came about as a result of One Direction covering "Teenage Dirtbag" on their ''[[Where We Are Tour (One Direction)|Where We Are Tour]]''.<ref name=OYsleeve/> The album was later released on CD through Blacktop Records in the UK in 2014, with three bonus tracks: "Only You", a single mix of "Holiday" and an acoustic version of "Only You".<ref name=TVLPUKsleeve>{{cite AV media notes|title=The Valentine LP |others=Wheatus |year=2014 |orig-year=First released in 2013|type=Sleeve |publisher= Montauk Mantis Productions}}</ref>

===2014–2018: Sixth studio album===
Since 2014, the band have been in the process of recording a sixth studio album. Tentatively titled ''Beasts of the Unknown'', Brown has stated that the direction of the album will be "80's metal" and will be inspired by the bands that he grew up listening to as a teenager.<ref name=Bristolpost>{{cite web|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Wheatus-nostalgic-ahead-Thekla-gig/story-27823509-detail/story.html|title=Wheatus get nostalgic ahead of their Thekla gig|work=Bristol Post|author=Jones, Craig|date=September 18, 2015|access-date=May 9, 2016}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The first track to feature on the album, "Zelda", first appeared in the band's live setlist in late 2014. Recording was due to take place in late 2015, until plans for a tour celebrating the fifteenth anniversary of their debut album were announced. During this time, William Tully left the band and was replaced on drums by Leo Freiré. Joey Slater also replaced Karlie Bruce after she left the band for a second time. The band then toured with [[Busted (band)|Busted]] on their ''Pigs Can Fly'' arena tour. Brown then stated that recording will continue following the tour's completion.

In late 2016, Brown stated in an interview; "Album [seven] is almost ready to be recorded and we'll be working on that over the winter and hope to have that done by 2017." Brown also stated that twenty songs had been written for the release, and the band were aiming to record them all before the start of the year.<ref name=Bristolpost/> "Tipsy" was released as the album's lead single on 22 December 2016. After announcing a further UK tour for April and May 2017, Brown announced that recording had once again halted. During this time, keyboardist Mark Palmer also left the band, with Brandon Ticer brought in as his replacement. Karlie Bruce also returned on backing vocals after a three-year absence, joining Gabrielle Sterbenz and Joey Slater. On June 8, 2018, "Lullaby" was released as the album's second single. A further new song, "Michelle", was first performed live in September 2018 and has often erroneously been referred to by Brown as the band's "new single" ever since, despite it not yet being released.

===2018–present: Touring & classic line-up reunion===
In November 2018, the band returned to the UK to tour as a support act for [[A (band)|A]] on a fifteenth anniversary tour in support of their album ''[[Hi-Fi Serious]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/wheatus-inme-heading-2002-af-uk-tour-hi-fi-serious-2337007|title=A, Wheatus and InMe are heading out on this 2002 AF UK tour|last=Andrew Trendell|date=2018-06-11|website=NME|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref> In early 2019, the band provided direct support to [[Mike Doughty]] on the first leg of his twenty-fifth anniversary tour of [[Soul Coughing]]'s ''[[Ruby Vroom]]'', their first full USA tour in many years.

In early 2019, the band announced plans for their first world tour since 2000, playing in the [[United States]] and [[South Africa]], as well as 48 dates across [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]] & the United Kingdom. On April 5, 2019, the band played a special show at the Mercury Lounge in New York, which featured two sets: one from the current line-up, and one from the "classic" lineup, with Peter Brown, Mike McCabe, Phil Jimenez, Liz Brown & Kathryn Froggatt performing together for the first time since 2003.<ref name=Mercuryloungetwitter>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/MercuryLoungeNY/status/1109117546026942465|title=Twitter: Mercury Lounge|via=Twitter|author=Mercury Lounge|date=March 22, 2019|access-date=March 27, 2019}}</ref> During the Welsh dates of the band's world tour, Brown expressed support for [[Scottish independence|Scottish]] and [[Welsh independence]] from the United Kingdom, showing up at a 'Yes' rally march.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thenational.scot/news/17619095.youll-never-guess-which-us-rock-stars-showed-up-for-the-yes-march/|title=You'll never guess which US rock stars showed up for the Yes march|publisher=[[The National (Scotland)]]|date=4 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://nation.cymru/news/new-york-rock-band-become-unlikely-welsh-independence-backers/|title=New York rock band become unlikely Welsh independence backers|date=12 May 2019|publisher=Nation.Cymru}}</ref>
