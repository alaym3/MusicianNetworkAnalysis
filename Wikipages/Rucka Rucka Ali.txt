==Controversies==
In June 2010, three British students were reprimanded after publicly showing Rucka Rucka Ali's music video for his hit parody "[[Ima Korean]]" to their class while studying different countries' musical traditions. One South Korean student was "devastated, upset, very offended, and feeling very lonely", being the only East-Asian child in the class. An assistant headteacher, Len Idle, said the song was "probably racist". Rucka Rucka Ali subsequently picked the quote as the title of his next album, ''[[Probably Racist]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10345282 |title=Bournemouth school pupils told off over 'racist' video |work=BBC News |date=June 17, 2010 |access-date=August 6, 2013}}</ref>

On July 24, 2013, Rucka Rucka Ali released the song "Zayn Did 9/11" (a parody of [[Selena Gomez]]'s "[[Come & Get It (Selena Gomez song)|Come & Get It]]") to YouTube which mocked [[One Direction]] member [[Zayn Malik]], jokingly saying he committed the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]].

At the end of the music video for his parody song "Life Is Over" (a parody of "[[Closer (The Chainsmokers song)|Closer]]"), released in October 2016, Rucka Rucka Ali admitted that he had a [[suicide attempt]] in the summer of 2006.
