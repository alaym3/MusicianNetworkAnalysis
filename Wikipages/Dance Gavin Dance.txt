===2005–07: ''Downtown Battle Mountain''===
{{Main|Downtown Battle Mountain}}
Dance Gavin Dance formed shortly after the dissolution of guitarist [[Will Swan (musician)|Will Swan]], drummer Matt Mingus and bassist Eric Lodge's previous band, Farewell Unknown. After recruiting unclean vocalist Jon Mess, clean vocalist [[Jonny Craig]] joined the band after leaving his former band Ghost Runner On Third due to conflicts within the group. In 2005, they self-released their debut extended play (EP), ''[[Whatever I Say Is Royal Ocean]]'', which was subsequently re-released on November 14, 2006, on [[Rise Records]].<ref name="Dance Gavin Dance Bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dance-gavin-dance-mn0000480549/biography|title=Dance Gavin Dance Bio|publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> Their debut studio album, ''[[Downtown Battle Mountain]]'', produced by [[Kris Crummett]], was released on May 15, 2007, on Rise Records. The band toured with American post-hardcore groups [[Alesana]], [[A Day To Remember]] and [[Pierce the Veil]] in support of the album.<ref>[http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,4090523,00.html] {{dead link|date=October 2020}}</ref>

In August 2007, guitarist Sean O'Sullivan departed from the group and was replaced by [[Strawberry Girls|Zachary Garren]]. In November 2007, singer Jonny Craig had left the group due to a heated argument between himself and the band's manager and when insisting on rejoining was denied due to tensions and personal conflicts within the band, mostly due to his lack of dependability and Craig's failure to be present during a portion of the band's set at Saints and Sinners Festival in [[New Jersey]] due to alcohol and drug related issues.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dance Gavin Dance - SubMerge Magazine|url=http://submergemag.com/featured/dance-gavin-dance/69|access-date=August 23, 2010|date=April 27, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx|title=Dance Gavin Dance kicks out singer|website=Lambgoat.com}}</ref>

<!--The album is self-titled. This is confirmed with sources. Do not change it.-->
Briefly following Jonny Craig's departure, Dance Gavin Dance held auditions to recruit a replacement clean vocalist. Nic Newsham of American [[post-hardcore]] band [[Gatsby's American Dream]] was offered to join, however chose not to despite later featuring on the song "Uneasy Hearts Weigh The Most" on their self-titled [[Dance Gavin Dance (album)|2008 album]]. Other singers that auditioned included [[Kellin Quinn]] of [[Sleeping with Sirens]], Matt Geise of [[Lower Definition]], and Thomas Dutton. [[Kurt Travis]], formerly of the [[Sacramento]] based rock bands Five Minute Ride, O! The Joy, and No Not Constant, became the group's new clean vocalist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/album.php?albumid=28941|title=Dance Gavin Dance - Dance Gavin Dance (album review)|publisher=[[Sputnikmusic]]}}</ref>

On April 20, 2008, the group entered the studio to record their self-titled second studio album with [[Kris Crummett]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Video Interview Live From HARDTIMES.CA - hardtimes.ca |url=http://hardtimes.ca/dancegavin |publisher=hardtimes.ca |access-date=August 23, 2010 |date=March 11, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928020951/http://hardtimes.ca/dancegavin |archive-date=September 28, 2010}}</ref> The album was released on August 19, 2008.<ref name="rise">{{cite web|url=http://www.riserecords.com/releasescontent.html |title=RISE releases |publisher=[[Rise Records]] |access-date=August 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821032949/http://www.riserecords.com/releasescontent.html |archive-date=August 21, 2008 }}</ref> Prior to the release of the album, but following its recording sessions, two original members, unclean vocalist Jon Mess and bassist Eric Lodge, departed from the band.<ref name="Dance Gavin Dance Bio"/> Following their respective departures, [[Will Swan (musician)|Will Swan]] pursued screaming vocal duties along with performing lead guitar, and Jason Ellis, formerly of Five Minute Ride, replaced Lodge on bass guitar.

In February 2009, the band went into the studio as a five-piece to record the follow-up to their self-titled album, yet again with producer Kris Crummett. The resulting album, ''[[Happiness (Dance Gavin Dance album)|Happiness]]'', was released on June 9, 2009, less than one year after the release of their second studio album. Bassist Jason Ellis appears on ''Happiness'', however left the group before its release, subsequently being replaced by Tim Feerick as a touring member. ''AllMusic'' gave a mixed review of the album, writing, "''Happiness'' bristles with the kind of overachiever eclecticism that's as impressive as it is divisive," but that two songs were marred by the "nasally realm of high school emo," leaving the listener unsatisfied with the experience.<ref>{{cite web|last=Monger|first=James|title=allmusic ((( Happiness > Overview )))|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1566891|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=[[allmusic]]|access-date=August 23, 2010}}</ref> A music video for the track "Tree Village" was released shortly after the album. The band embarked on tours with American rock bands [[Emarosa]], [[Closure in Moscow]], [[Scary Kids Scaring Kids]], and others in support of the album.

On February 10, 2010, guitarist Zachary Garren was allegedly ousted by the band due to personal conflicts with other members. Shortly after, Garren met drummer Ben Rosett and formed the [[math rock]] trio [[Strawberry Girls]], now signed to [[Tragic Hero Records]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Yarborough |first=Aaron |title=Exclusive: Dance Gavin Dance Kick Out Guitarist |url=https://www.decoymusic.com/news_posts/29383 |publisher=Decoy Music |access-date=August 23, 2010 |date=February 10, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007154708/http://www.decoymusic.com/news_posts/29383 |archive-date=October 7, 2012 }}</ref> Dance Gavin Dance played the Soundwave festival as scheduled as a four-piece with Swan handling all guitar duties and [[Kurt Travis]] playing keyboards.

===2013–14: ''Acceptance Speech''===

{{Main|Acceptance Speech (Dance Gavin Dance album)}}

On August 21, 2012, Dance Gavin Dance announced Craig's departure via Facebook, stating:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/DanceGavinDance#!/DanceGavinDance/posts/409931672396304 |title=Dance Gavin Dance |publisher=Facebook |access-date=May 2, 2013}}</ref>
{{quote|"When Jonny rejoined DGD, we were about to call it quits. Tired of touring and being away from home for 8 months of the year, we wanted to shake things up. We thought it'd be fun to do a dbm sequel with Jonny and go out on that. We recorded dbm2 and felt it would be a disservice to our fans not to let them hear the new record live. We did a tour and felt rejuvenated but Jonny wasn't in a good place. After trying to convince him into getting help over warped tour, we canceled a headliner in November/December 2011 and told him we wouldn't tour until he sought out real help for his addiction. We got our good friend Matt Geise to fill in for a short run we did earlier this year while Jonny was in rehab. He was released and wanted to be out on the road immediately. We weren't sure how things would go so we only booked a small portion of the all stars tour to see if Jonny could still function as our lead singer. After a week and a half things were not going well. Everything came to a head when Jonny was publicly scolded by the owner of [[Sumerian Records]] for multiple offenses. It was then that we realized that our time with Jonny had reached its end. We wish Jonny the best In his future endeavors but he will no longer be a part of DGD. We however will continue playing and writing music because it's what we love doing."}}

[[Tilian Pearson]], formerly of [[Tides of Man]], was asked to replace Craig as clean vocalist during the making of his solo album, ''Material Me'' (2013). Pearson, along with guitarist Josh Benton and bass guitarist Tim Feerick, were confirmed as official members by Jon Mess. The band's fifth album, ''[[Acceptance Speech (Dance Gavin Dance album)|Acceptance Speech]]'', was released on October 8, 2013 with Rise Records. The album was produced by Matt Malpass. Shortly after the shooting of their music video for their single "Strawberry Swisher Pt. 3", Josh Benton parted ways with the band in order to focus on his career as an audio engineer and producer. Aric Garcia of post-hardcore band [[Hail the Sun]] replaced Benton for The Acceptance Speech Tour and The Rise Records tour. On September 17, Dance Gavin Dance released a b-side from ''Acceptance Speech'', entitled "Pussy Vultures".
