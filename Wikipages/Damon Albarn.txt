'''Damon Albarn''' {{postnom|country=GBR|OBE}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|eɪ|m|ən|_|ˈ|æ|l|b|ɑr|n}}; born 23 March 1968) is an English musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer, best known as the frontman and primary lyricist of the rock band [[Blur (band)|Blur]] and as the co-founder, lead vocalist, instrumentalist, and primary songwriter of the [[virtual band]] [[Gorillaz]].

Raised in [[Leytonstone]], East London, and around [[Colchester (borough)|Colchester, Essex]], Albarn attended the [[The Stanway School|Stanway School]], where he met guitarist [[Graham Coxon]] and formed Blur, releasing their debut album ''[[Leisure (album)|Leisure]]'' in 1991.  After spending long periods touring the US, Albarn's songwriting became increasingly influenced by British bands from the 1960s. The result was the Blur albums ''[[Modern Life Is Rubbish]]'' (1993), ''[[Parklife]]'' (1994) and ''[[The Great Escape (Blur album)|The Great Escape]]'' (1995). All three albums received critical acclaim while Blur gained mass popularity in the UK, aided by a [[Britpop]] [[Britpop#"The Battle of Britpop"|chart rivalry]] with [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]. Subsequent albums such as ''[[Blur (Blur album)|Blur]]'' (1997), ''[[13 (Blur album)|13]]'' (1999), and ''[[Think Tank (Blur album)|Think Tank]]'' (2003) incorporated influences from [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]], [[art rock]], [[Electronic music|electronic]] and [[world music]]. These were followed by ''[[The Magic Whip]]'' (2015), Blur's first studio album in 12 years.

Albarn formed the [[virtual band]] Gorillaz in 1998 with comic book artist [[Jamie Hewlett]]. Drawing influences from hip hop, [[dub music|dub]], pop,<ref>{{cite book |last = Brown |first = Cass |author-link = Cass Browne |author2=Gorillaz |title = [[Rise of the Ogre]] |date = 2 November 2006 |publisher = Penguin |location = United States |isbn = 1-59448-931-9 |pages = 42–48}}</ref> [[trip hop]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2001-07-03/music/monkey-wrench/|title=Monkey Wrench|last=Rees|first=Christina|date=3 July 2001|website=The Village Voice|access-date=9 May 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006115606/http://www.villagevoice.com/2001-07-03/music/monkey-wrench/|archive-date=6 October 2014}}</ref> and [[world music]],<ref name="mfHZ">{{cite magazine|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/album/gorillaz-human/|title=Gorillaz – 'Humanz'|last=Wehner|first=Cyclone|magazine=Music Feeds|date=April 2017|access-date=7 August 2019}}</ref> Gorillaz released their [[Gorillaz (album)|self-titled debut album]] in 2001 to worldwide success, spawning successful follow-ups ''[[Demon Days]]'' (2005), ''[[Plastic Beach]]'', ''[[The Fall (Gorillaz album)|The Fall]]'' (both released in 2010), ''[[Humanz]]'' (2017), ''[[The Now Now]]'' (2018) and the first season of their ''[[Song Machine]]'' project, ''[[Song Machine, Season One: Strange Timez]]'' (2020). Although Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor, Gorillaz albums typically feature collaborations from a range of artists. Gorillaz are cited by the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as the "Most Successful Virtual Band".

Albarn's other notable projects have included two [[supergroup (music)|supergroups]]: the [[The Good, the Bad & the Queen|Good, the Bad & the Queen]] and [[Rocket Juice & the Moon]], working with the non-profit organization [[Africa Express (organization)|Africa Express]], which he co-founded, and composing [[film soundtracks]]. He also scored the stage productions ''[[Monkey: Journey to the West]]'' (2008), ''[[Dr Dee]]'' (2012) and ''[[Wonder.land]]'' (2016). His debut solo studio album ''[[Everyday Robots]]'' was released in 2014, with his second ''[[The Nearer the Fountain, More Pure the Stream Flows]]'' released in 2021.

In 2008, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' ranked Albarn number 18 in their list of the "100 most powerful people in British culture".<ref>{{cite news|title=The 100 most powerful people in British culture|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3672604/The-100-most-powerful-people-in-British-culture-1-20.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=9 November 2016}}</ref> In 2016, Albarn received the [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Lifetime Achievement from the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theivors.com/the-ivors-2016/|title=The Ivors 2016|website=The Ivors|access-date=8 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160523012357/http://theivors.com/the-ivors-2016/|archive-date=23 May 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> He was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[2016 New Year Honours]] for services to music.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=61450 |supp=y|page=N10|date=30 December 2015}}</ref> In 2020, Albarn was granted [[Icelandic citizenship]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Moore |first=Sam |date=11 November 2021 |title=Damon Albarn says he always had a sense he wasn't 'just English' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/damon-albarn-icelandic-citizenship-english-b1955919.html |access-date=15 November 2021 |website=[[The Independent]]}}</ref>

==Early life==
Albarn was born on 23 March 1968; he is the elder child of artist [[Keith Albarn]] and his wife Hazel, ''née'' Dring. Their daughter Jessica, born in 1971, also went on to become an artist.<ref name="Maconie">Maconie, Stuart (1999). ''Blur: 3862 Days, The Official History''.

[[File:Damon Albarn (Waltham Forest Heritage).jpg|thumb|right|Commemorative plaque at 21 Fillebrook Road [[Leytonstone]], East London where Albarn was brought up]]
When Damon and Jessica were growing up, their family moved to [[Leytonstone]], East London.<ref name=Maconie/> The household was described as "[[Bohemianism|bohemian]]"<ref name="Ankeny">Ankeny, Jason [{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p50874/biography|pure_url=yes}} "Damon Albarn Biography"], AllMusic, Macrovision Corporation</ref> and their upbringing as "liberal".<ref name=Harris2003/> Damon and Jessica were also raised in the [[Quaker]] religion. Albarn agreed with his parents' views, later claiming, "I always thought my parents were absolutely dead right. I went against the grain in a weird way – by continually following them."<ref name=Harris2003/> His parents primarily listened to [[blues]], Indian [[ragas]] and [[African music]].<ref name=Maconie/> When Albarn was nine years old, his family took a holiday trip to [[Turkey]] for three months before settling in [[Aldham, Essex]], an area described by Albarn as "one of those burgeoning [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] experiments where they were building loads of small estates".<ref name="pulse">''[[No Distance Left to Run (film)|No Distance Left To Run]]''. Pulse Films (2010)</ref> The population of the area was predominantly [[White British|white]] as opposed to the ethnically mixed part of London which he had become used to. He described himself as "not really fitting in with the politics of the place."<ref name=pulse/>

Albarn was interested in music from an early age, attending an [[The Osmonds|Osmonds]] concert at the age of six.<ref name=smh>{{cite web|title=sometime in 2001, ZOMBIE HIP-HOP|url=http://www.gorillaz-unofficial.com/media_archive/smhinterview01.htm|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2 October 2012|year=2001|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305150450/http://www.gorillaz-unofficial.com/media_archive/smhinterview01.htm|archive-date=5 March 2016}}</ref> He started playing guitar, piano and violin in his youth and was interested in composing music, one of his compositions winning a heat in the nationwide Young Composer of the Year competition.<ref name=Maconie/><ref name=smh/> Damon and Jessica both attended a primary school nearby which, according to Damon, was [[Arson|burnt down]] seven times over a period of 18 months by one of the teachers. After both siblings failed their [[Eleven-Plus exam]]s, they started attending [[The Stanway School|Stanway Comprehensive School]], where Damon described himself as being "really unpopular" and "[irritating to] a lot of people".<ref name=pulse /> However, he developed an interest in drama and started acting in various school productions.<ref name=Maconie/><ref name=pulse/> It was at Stanway where he would meet future Blur guitarist [[Graham Coxon]], who recalls seeing him act and feeling that he was a "confident performer" as well as a "show off".<ref name=pulse/> Albarn's first words directed at Coxon were "Your [[brogues]] are crap, mate. Look, mine are the proper sort"<ref name=Maconie/> as he was showing off his leather shoes, fashionable footwear at the time influenced by the [[Mod Revival]].<ref name=pulse /> Nevertheless, the pair went on to become good friends, due to their shared passion for music, particularly bands such as [[the Jam]], [[the Beatles]], [[the Human League]], [[XTC]] and [[Madness (band)|Madness]].<ref name=Maconie/> Albarn has also credited [[the Specials]] and [[Fun Boy Three]] as some of his earliest influences,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410143343/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVCg4BnxtGY&gl=US&hl=en|title=Damon Albarn On First Songs He Wrote With Graham Coxon - YouTube|date=10 April 2014|website=Web.archive.org|access-date=13 November 2021}}</ref> and [[John Lennon]] in him taking up songwriting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/music/musicnews/damon-albarn-wished-worked-john-lennon-1164780.html|title=Damon Albarn wished he worked with John Lennon|first=26|last=September 2018|website=Femalefirst.co.uk|access-date=17 August 2020}}</ref>

He studied acting at the [[East 15 Acting School]] in [[Debden, Epping Forest|Debden]], but left after the first year. On leaving drama school he entered a production and management contract with Marijke Bergkamp and Graeme Holdaway, owners of the Beat Factory recording studio, where the members of Blur, then known as Seymour, did their first recordings. His first band was the [[synthpop]] group, Two's a Crowd.<ref name=Ankeny/> Before Blur, he played with the Aftermath and Real Lives.<ref name="Harris2003"/>

====Formation and ''Leisure''====
[[File:Blur Newcastle 2009 Coxon Albarn.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Albarn (right) and [[Graham Coxon]] (left) performing with [[Blur (band)|Blur]] at Newcastle Academy in June 2009]]
Albarn enrolled on a part-time music course at London's [[Goldsmiths College]] in 1988, claiming that his sole intention was to gain access to the student union bar.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkNvk2MgiCc |title=Nardwuar vs. Blur |via=YouTube |access-date=30 April 2014}}</ref> Albarn was in a group named Circus alongside Coxon and drummer [[Dave Rowntree]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Harris |first=John |author-link=John Harris (critic) |date=2004 |title=Britpop!: Cool Britannia and the Spectacular Demise of English Rock |publisher=Da Capo |isbn=9780306813672}}</ref><ref name="Thompson209">Thompson, pg. 209</ref> [[Alex James (musician)|Alex James]], a fellow student at Goldsmiths, eventually joined as the group's bassist.

In October 1990, Blur released their first single, "[[She's So High (Blur song)|She's So High]]", which reached number 48 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="Strong" /> The band had trouble creating a follow-up single, but made progress when paired with producer [[Stephen Street]]. The resulting single, "[[There's No Other Way]]", became a hit, peaking at number eight.<ref>Harris 2004, pg. 53–55</ref> As a result of the single's success, Blur became pop stars and were accepted into a clique of bands who frequented the Syndrome club in London dubbed the "[[The Scene That Celebrates Itself|Scene That Celebrates Itself]]".<ref>Harris 2004, pg. 56–57</ref> The recording of the group's debut album was hindered by Albarn having to write his lyrics in the studio. Although the resulting album ''[[Leisure (album)|Leisure]]'' (1991) peaked at number seven on the [[UK Albums Chart]], it received mixed reviews,<ref name="Strong" /> and according to journalist [[John Harris (critic)|John Harris]], "could not shake off the odour of anti-climax".<ref>Harris 2004, pg. 59</ref> Albarn has since referred to ''Leisure'' as "awful".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/a46469/damon-albarn-criticises-blur-albums.html|title=Digital Spy – Albarn cusses own albums.|date=12 May 2007|access-date=2 December 2012}}</ref>

====Britpop era====
After discovering they were £60,000 in debt, Blur toured the US in 1992 in an attempt to recoup their losses.<ref>Harris 2004, pg. 66</ref> Albarn and the band became increasingly unhappy and homesick during the two-month American tour and began writing songs which "created an English atmosphere".<ref name="shite">Harris, John. "A shite sports car and a punk reincarnation". ''NME''. 10 April 1993.</ref> Blur had undergone an ideological and image shift intended to celebrate their English heritage in contrast to the popularity of American [[grunge]] bands like [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]].<ref>Harris 2004, pg. 79</ref> Although sceptical of Albarn's new manifesto, Balfe gave his assent for the band's choice of [[Andy Partridge]] of the band [[XTC]] to produce their follow-up to ''Leisure''. The sessions with Partridge proved unsatisfactory, but a chance reunion with Stephen Street resulted in him returning to produce the group.<ref>Harris 2004, pg. 82</ref>

The second Blur album, ''[[Modern Life Is Rubbish]]'', was released in May 1993 and peaked at number 15 on the British charts,<ref name="UKChart">"[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/blur/ Blur Single & Album Chart History]". [[Official Charts Company]]. Retrieved 21 August 2012.</ref> but failed to break into the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling only 19,000 copies.<ref>Duffy, Tom. "SBK, Blur focus on U.S. market". ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. 28 May 1994.</ref><ref name="allmusicawards">"[https://www.allmusic.com/artist/blur-mn0000758444/awards Blur – Awards]". AllMusic. Retrieved 21 August 2012.</ref> Despite the album's poor performance, Albarn was happy with the band's direction and wrote prolifically for Blur's next album. ''[[Parklife]]'' was released in 1994 and revived Blur's commercial fortunes, with the album's first single, the disco-influenced "[[Girls & Boys (Blur song)|Girls & Boys]]", achieving critical acclaim and chart success. ''Parklife'' entered the British charts at number one and stayed in the album charts for 90 weeks.<ref>Harris 2004, pg. 142</ref> Enthusiastically greeted by the music press, ''Parklife'' is regarded as one of Britpop's defining records.<ref>Dee, John. "Blur – ''Parklife''". ''NME''. April 1994.</ref><ref>Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. "[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r202255|pure_url=yes}} ''Parklife'' review]". [[AllMusic]]. Retrieved 16 June 2008.</ref> Blur won four awards at the [[1995 Brit Awards]], including [[Brit Award for British Group|Best British Group]] and [[Brit Award for British Album of the Year|British Album of the Year]] for ''Parklife''.<ref>Harris 2004, pg. 192</ref> Coxon later pointed to ''Parklife'' as the moment when "[Blur] went from being regarded as an alternative, leftfield arty band to this amazing new pop sensation".<ref name="totalguitar">Tuxen, Henrik; Dalley, Helen. "Graham Coxon interview". ''[[Total Guitar]]''. May 1999.</ref> Albarn was uncomfortable with fame, however, and he suffered from [[panic attacks]].<ref name="pulse" />

Blur began working on their fourth album ''[[The Great Escape (Blur album)|The Great Escape]]'' at the start of 1995.<ref>Harris 2004, pg. 222</ref> Building upon the band's previous two albums, Albarn's lyrics for the album consisted of several third-person narratives. James reflected, "It was all more elaborate, more orchestral, more theatrical, and the lyrics were even more twisted ... It was all dysfunctional, misfit characters fucking up."<ref>Harris 2004, pg. 223–24</ref> The release of the album's lead single "[[Country House (song)|Country House]]" played a part in Blur's public rivalry with Manchester band [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] termed the "[[Battle of Britpop]]". Partly due to increasing antagonism between the groups, Blur and Oasis decided to release their new singles on the same day, an event the ''NME'' called the "British Heavyweight Championship". The debate over which band would top the British singles chart became a media phenomenon, and Albarn appeared on ''[[ITV News at Ten|News at Ten]]''.<ref name="liveforever">''Live Forever: The Rise and Fall of Brit Pop''. Passion Pictures, 2004.</ref> At the end of the week, "Country House" outsold Oasis' "[[Roll with It (Oasis song)|Roll With It]]" by 274,000 copies to 216,000, becoming Blur's first number-one single.<ref>Harris 2004, pg. 235</ref>

''The Great Escape'' was released in September 1995 to positive reviews, and entered the UK charts at number one. However, opinion quickly changed and Blur found themselves largely out of favour with the media. Following the worldwide success of Oasis' ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'', the media quipped that Blur "wound up winning the battle but losing the war."<ref>[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine|Erlewine, Stephen Thomas]]. "[{{AllMusic|class=song|id=t1315546|pure_url=yes}} 'Country House' song review]". AllMusic. Retrieved 16 June 2008.</ref> Blur became perceived as an "inauthentic middle-class pop band" in comparison to the "working-class heroes" Oasis, which Albarn said made him feel "stupid and confused".<ref name="liveforever" /> Bassist James said: "After being the People's Hero, Damon was the People's Prick for a short period ... basically, he was a loser – very publicly."<ref name="select">Maconie, Stuart. "The Death of a Party". ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'' (August 1999).</ref>

====Post-Britpop and hiatus====
An early 1996 ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' interview reported that relations between Blur members had become strained; journalist Adrian Deevoy wrote that he found them "on the verge of a nervous breakup."<ref name="select"/> Coxon, in particular, began to resent his bandmates<ref name="select"/> and, in a rejection of the group's Britpop aesthetic, made a point of listening to noisy American alternative rock bands such as [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]].<ref>Harris 2004, pg. 259–60</ref> Albarn grew to appreciate Coxon's tastes in lo-fi and underground music, and recognised the need to change Blur's musical direction once again. "I can sit at my piano and write brilliant observational pop songs all day long but you've got to move on," he said,<ref name="select"/> and decided to give Coxon more creative control over their new album. Albarn visited Iceland during this period: "I used to have a recurring dream, as a child, of a black sand beach. And one hazy, lazy day [laughs], I was watching the TV and I saw a programme about Iceland, and they had black beaches. So I got on a plane ... I was on my own: I didn't know anybody. I went into the street, [[Laugavegur (Reykjavík)|Laugavegur]], where the bars are, and that was it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://damonalbarnunofficial.wordpress.com/2013/03/06/damon-albarn-gorillaz-heroin-and-the-last-days-of-blur-the-guardian-april-2012/ |title=Damon Albarn &#124; 'Gorillaz, heroin and the last days of Blur' – The Guardian: April 2012 &#124; damon albarn unofficial archive |publisher=Damonalbarnunofficial.wordpress.com |date=6 March 2013 |access-date=30 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221193335/http://damonalbarnunofficial.wordpress.com/2013/03/06/damon-albarn-gorillaz-heroin-and-the-last-days-of-blur-the-guardian-april-2012/ |archive-date=21 February 2014 }}</ref>

After initial sessions in London, the band left to record the rest of the album in Iceland, away from the Britpop scene.<ref name="select"/> The result was ''[[Blur (Blur album)|Blur]]'', the band's fifth studio album, released in February 1997. Although the music press predicted that the lo-fi sonic experimentation would alienate Blur's teenage girl fanbase, they generally applauded the effort. Pointing out lyrics such as "Look inside America / She's alright", and noting Albarn's "obligatory nod to [[Beck]], [and promotion of] the new Pavement album as if paid to do so", reviewers felt the band had come to accept American values during this time – an about-face of their attitude during the Britpop years.<ref>Collins, Andrew.

==Politics and activism==
In 2005, Albarn, among others, criticised the London [[Live 8]] concert for not featuring enough black artists; among the few included were [[Ms. Dynamite]], [[Snoop Dogg]], and [[Youssou N'Dour]]. Eventually the organisers added a separate concert at the [[Eden Project]] in Cornwall to the programme to showcase African musicians. Albarn said he did not want to perform at Live 8 because he thought it was too "exclusive" and may have been motivated by self-promotion.<ref name="NME website"/>

In November 2001, shortly after the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|invasion of Afghanistan]] in response to [[September 11 attacks]], the [[MTV Europe Music Awards]] were held in [[Frankfurt]], where Gorillaz won awards for Best Song and Best Dance.<ref name="guardianemas01">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/nov/09/1|title=Brits take six MTV Europe awards|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=9 November 2001|access-date=9 October 2012}}</ref> As Albarn and Jamie Hewlett walked onto stage to make a speech after receiving the latter award, Albarn wore a T-shirt with the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] logo on it. In his speech, he said "So, fuck the music. Listen. See this symbol here, [pointing to the T-shirt] this the symbol for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.

In 2002, [[Iraq]] was under threat of invasion from a coalition which included the United States and the United Kingdom. [[Opposition to the Iraq War|Opposition from the public]] led to [[Protests against the Iraq War|protests]] being organised by a number of organisations. Albarn spoke out against the invasion.<ref name="Anderson">{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Errol|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/10-things-you-never-knew-about-damon-albarn|title=10 Things You Never Knew About Damon Albarn|access-date=19 November 2011}}</ref><ref name="NME 20 August 2002">{{cite journal|title=WAR ON WAR!|journal=[[NME]]|date=20 August 2002|url=https://www.nme.com/news/blur/12332|access-date=15 September 2012}}</ref><ref name="Smith (Martin)">{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Martin|title=Musicians who won't be silenced|url=http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=3298|newspaper=[[Socialist Worker]]|access-date=15 September 2012}}</ref>

Albarn teamed up with [[Robert "3D" Del Naja]] of [[Massive Attack]] and worked with [[Stop the War Coalition]], [[CND]] and the [[Muslim Association of Britain]] to organise campaigns to raise awareness of the potential dangers of the UK's involvement in the war.<ref name="XFM (Albarns Protest)"/> This included spending £15,000 on anti-war adverts which ran in the ''[[NME]]'', featuring quotes from [[Tony Benn]] and the former US Attorney-General, [[Ramsey Clark]].<ref name="Rock Crusaders"/>

Albarn revealed that originally, many people whom he knew were against the [[Iraq War]] were reluctant to take a stand, stating "to be honest with you when [[Robert Del Naja]] and myself started really stepping up prior to the war it was very difficult to find anyone. And I don't want to name any names because they are people who I respect but they were really, for some reason, very reticent to stand with us. A lot of people who you would now associate with being anti-war at that particular point didn't seem to be prepared to do it."<ref name=Kennard/>

Albarn was due to speak in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] on the rally in February 2003 when a million people took to the streets of London in protest at the imminent war. In the event, he was too emotional to deliver his speech.<ref name=scotsman03>{{cite journal|title=Deconstructing Damon|journal=The Scotsman|date=16 November 2003}}</ref> Albarn later revealed that he had "this image of my grandad in his slippers reading the paper, knowing that his grandson had been involved in something which he'd put so much of his life into" and "got over-emotional". He also stated that "it obviously wasn't the best moment to get in that state, when you're at the head of the biggest peace march in the history of this country."<ref name=Mulholland />

Albarn also attended a protest in November where he commented on the diversity of people in attendance, saying that "It represents everybody. It's the voice in our democracy and that's why we should be listened to."<ref>{{cite web|title=Damon Albarn @ Anti Bush Protest (2003)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGi2jF5T8Tg|via=YouTube|access-date=17 November 2012|author=TracyJackAlbarn2|date=6 October 2012}}</ref> Speaking about the experience in 2008, Albarn stated:<blockquote>I think in this case the only reason we went to war was the result of our individual apathy in the end. You know, our inability to really express what was I think was a consensus that this was a terrifying idea and a very badly thought-out one.<ref name="Kennard" /></blockquote>
