== Internet career ==

=== Early years and content evolution (2006–2017) ===
White started making YouTube videos in 2006, when he uploaded music and [[anime music video|AMVs]] to his old channels.<ref>{{Cite AV media|author=White, Charles, Jr.|publisher=penguinz0|title=Youtube Owes Anime Fans|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26d5-dLklLU|via=[[YouTube]]|language=en|access-date=March 12, 2021|archive-date=January 21, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210121141616/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26d5-dLklLU|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="10Years" /> He created his penguinz0 YouTube channel on May 7, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=penguinz0 – YouTube about page|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/penguinz0/about|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210111055947/https://www.youtube.com/user/penguinz0/about|archive-date=January 11, 2021|website=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=December 25, 2020}}</ref> On August 5, he uploaded his first non-deleted video, which featured gameplay of ''[[Gears of War (video game)|Gears of War]]''.<ref>{{cite AV media|author=White, Charles, Jr.|publisher=penguinz0|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FoH_02Icjk&feature=emb_title|title=gears of war jetpack glitch (NO Standbye or lag switch) AP|via=[[YouTube]]|date=August 5, 2007|accessdate=December 25, 2020}}</ref> During this time, he streamed live on [[Justin.tv]] from late 2009 to early 2010.<ref>{{Cite AV media|author=White, Charles, Jr.|publisher=penguinz0|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?&v=ZlXXNxpCUqk&t=222s|title=My Past|via=[[YouTube]]|date=January 24, 2021|access-date=January 25, 2021|archive-date=May 24, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210524230420/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlXXNxpCUqk&t=222s|url-status=live}}</ref>

White's audience rapidly grew after he uploaded a video titled ''The Most Difficult Game Ever Created Gameplay and Commentary'', in which he commentates while playing the online game ''[[QWOP]]'' and calls it "the hardest game he had ever played".
