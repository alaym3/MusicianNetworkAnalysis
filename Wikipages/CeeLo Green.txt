==Early life==

At the time of his mother's death, Green's career with [[Goodie Mob]] had just begun taking off. He sank into a deep [[clinical depression|depression]], which he later wrote about in various songs throughout his career, including "Free" by Goodie Mob, "Just a Thought" on ''[[St. Elsewhere (album)|St. Elsewhere]]'', and "She Knows" and "A Little Better" on ''[[The Odd Couple (album)|The Odd Couple]]''.<ref name=nytimes040608/><ref>rollingstone.com

==Music career==
===1991–1998: Early career with Goodie Mob===
Along with [[Big Gipp]], [[T-Mo]], and [[Khujo]], Green was an original member of the [[Atlanta]] hip hop group [[Goodie Mob]]. He is the youngest of the four.<ref name=ALLMUSIC>{{cite web|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p458353/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=allmusic Biography|publisher=Allmusic.com|access-date=August 23, 2010}}</ref> The Goodie Mob was a part of the Atlanta rap collective the [[Dungeon Family]], which also included [[Outkast]]. Goodie Mob appeared on two tracks on OutKast's 1994 debut album ''[[Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik]]'', with Green providing vocals for "Call of da Wild" and "[[Git Up, Git Out]]".

Goodie Mob released their debut album, ''[[Soul Food (Goodie Mob album)|Soul Food]]'', in 1995. The album received much critical praise as a pioneering record for the emerging [[Southern rap]] scene. It featured a distinctive soulful southern sound by production team [[Organized Noize]].

During this time, Green also contributed backing vocals to [[TLC (group)|TLC]]'s hit 1995 song "[[Waterfalls (TLC song)|Waterfalls]]".<ref>{{cite news|author=Jeff Benjamin|url=http://www.fuse.tv/videos/2013/10/tlc-waterfalls-interview-ceelo|title=TLC Reflect on No. 1 Hit "Waterfalls," Detail Cee Lo's Involvement – Exclusive Interview|publisher=Fuse.tv|date=October 22, 2013|access-date=July 19, 2014}}</ref>

The group's second album, ''[[Still Standing (Goodie Mob album)|Still Standing]]'', came out in 1998 and also received much critical praise. Its commercial performance was slightly lower than the group's previous effort, however. Green took more creative control on the group's next album, ''[[World Party (album)|World Party]]'', which was released in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bush|first=John|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r442557|title=World Party – Allmusic|publisher=Allmusic.com|date=December 21, 1999|access-date=November 12, 2011}}</ref>

===1999–2003: Move to Arista===
Around 1999, during the making of the album ''World Party'', Green left Goodie Mob to pursue a solo career under [[Arista Records|Arista]] and the remaining members continued to perform together under the Goodie Mob name with [[Koch Records]]. They did, however, collaborate in combinations in the [[Dungeon Family]] album ''[[Even in Darkness]]''.

The song "Hold On" from [[Big Boi]]'s ''[[Got Purp? Vol. 2]]'' album was the first newly recorded Goodie Mob song with all four members since ''World Party''.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4HSJOu6uEvUC&pg=PT30|title=Quick Cuts – Reviews|last=Anderson|first=Kyle|date=December 2005|journal=Spin|access-date=January 19, 2016}}</ref>

Green was one of ten guest musicians who contributed to the 1999 [[Santana (band)|Santana]] album ''[[Supernatural (Santana album)|Supernatural]]''. [[Lauryn Hill]] wrote "Do You Like the Way", and she and Green both provided lead vocals. Green also contributed to the track "We're All Gonna Die" on the 2000 album ''[[Eat at Whitey's]]'' by [[Everlast (musician)|Everlast]].

Green's Arista career was short-lived, as he was dropped after two albums due to low record sales. His first album, ''[[Cee-Lo Green and His Perfect Imperfections]]'' (2002), was heavily in the vein of various other Dungeon Family releases, with southern soul/funk/jazz backings produced by Green and boasting appearances by fellow Dungeon Fam members [[Big Gipp]] and [[Dungeon Family#Backbone|Backbone]]. The album did not sell very well, but Green achieved some airplay with the single "Closet Freak".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bmi.com/news/entry/cee_lo_green_love_and_happiness|title=Cee Lo Green: Love and Happiness|first=Ari|last=Surdoval|publisher=BMI|date=February 8, 2011|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref>

===2004–2008: Second solo album and formation of Gnarls Barkley===
[[File:Gnarls Barkley.jpg|thumb|right|Green (front) with Danger Mouse (back)]]
His second Arista album, ''[[Cee-Lo Green... Is the Soul Machine]]'' (2004) brought a more branched-out sound and more deeply explored southern rap music. This is evidenced by collaborations with "the biggest hip-hop musicians of all time", including [[Ludacris]], [[T.I.]], and [[Pharrell Williams]].{{Sfn|Watson|2013|p=43}} The album debuted and peaked at number 2 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|Top R&B/Hip Hop Album]] chart.{{Sfn|Watson|2013|p=44}} It received critical acclaim and was described as "one of the most ambitious albums to come out of any genre in recent times."{{Sfn|Watson|2013|p=45}}

Along with DJ [[Danger Mouse (music producer)|Danger Mouse]], Green formed a duo called [[Gnarls Barkley]]. Green first met Danger Mouse at a [[University of Georgia]] event. They later collaborated on the remix of the Danger Mouse and [[Jemini]] song "What U Sittin' On?" from the album ''[[Ghetto Pop Life]]'',<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/12.11/sample.html|title=Sample the Future|last=Goetz|first=Thomas|date=November 2004|magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}</ref> before working together again on the 2005 [[Danger Doom]] album ''[[The Mouse and The Mask]]'' on the song "Benzie Box", where Green sings the chorus.<ref name="Whitburn2007">{{cite book|first=Joel|last=Whitburn|title=The Billboard Albums: Includes Every Album That Made the Billboard 200 Chart|date=April 15, 2007|publisher=Record Research Incorporated|isbn=978-0-89820-166-6|page=264}}</ref>

Gnarls Barkley's first album, ''[[St. Elsewhere (album)|St. Elsewhere]]'', was released on April 24, 2006 in the UK and May 2, 2006 in the United States. ''St. Elsewhere'' entered the charts at No.1 in the UK, as did the first single "[[Crazy (Gnarls Barkley song)|Crazy]]". "Crazy" is the first single to reach number one in the UK based on [[music download|digital download]] sales alone and is ranked by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' as the greatest song of the decade, thus making it Green's most successful project to date.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /> A second album by Gnarls Barkley, titled ''[[The Odd Couple (album)|The Odd Couple]]'', was released in March 2008. Its first single came out in January, titled "[[Run (I'm a Natural Disaster)]]".<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

Seeing the success achieved by Gnarls Barkley, [[Arista Records|Arista]] and Legacy released a 17-track greatest hits collection of songs by Green, titled ''[[Closet Freak: The Best of Cee-Lo Green the Soul Machine]]''. It features predominantly solo tracks by Green and several Goodie Mob songs.<ref name="LLC2007">{{cite book|author=SPIN Media LLC|title=SPIN|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_G-FewpAsvB0C|date=February 2007|publisher=SPIN Media LLC|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_G-FewpAsvB0C/page/n78 83]–|issn=0886-3032}}</ref> Green's song "What Part of Forever" was included on ''[[The Twilight Saga: Eclipse]]'' [[The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (soundtrack)|soundtrack]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/twilight-saga-eclipse-original/id375362499|title=The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)|date=May 25, 2010|publisher=Apple iTunes|access-date=June 24, 2014}}</ref> In 2008, Green published a rendition of the 1974 single "[[Kung Fu Fighting]]" by Jamaican vocalist [[Carl Douglas]], for the animated film ''[[Kung Fu Panda (film)|Kung Fu Panda]]''.{{Sfn|Cook|2012|p=37}}

===2009–2011: ''The Lady Killer'' and tours===
On August 14, 2010, Green released the single "[[Fuck You (CeeLo Green song)|Fuck You]]" to [[YouTube]] ahead of his planned solo album release, due to its partial leak on April 13.

On June 16, 2011, journalist Andrea Swensson of ''[[City Pages]]'' negatively reviewed one of Green's performances, writing that it "failed to measure up to the fun factor of his recorded material. Green spent most of the set stationed in front of a microphone at the center of the stage, barely moving an inch while he sang, and flanked by two forgettable back-up singers and a DJ that was all but hidden behind a giant LCD display".<ref>{{cite web|first=Andrea|last=Swensson|url=http://blogs.citypages.com/gimmenoise/2011/06/rihanna_cee_lo_green_review.php|title=Rihanna and Cee Lo Green at the Target Center, 6/16/11 – Minneapolis Music – Gimme Noise|publisher=Blogs.citypages.com|date=June 17, 2011|access-date=November 12, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110801043532/http://blogs.citypages.com/gimmenoise/2011/06/rihanna_cee_lo_green_review.php#|archive-date=August 1, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> In response, the following day Green tweeted "I respect your criticism but be fair!

On December 31, 2011, Green sang [[John Lennon]]'s "[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]" just prior to the [[Times Square Ball|ball drop]] for New Year's Eve at New York City's [[Times Square]]. In his rendition, Green replaced the line "and no religion, too" with the words "and all religions true".<ref name=eonline>Sung at 11:57 p.m. as per video at {{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/imagine_all_scandal_cee_lo_tweets_then/283605|title=Imagine All the Scandal: Cee Lo Tweets, Then Deletes, Apology After Changing John Lennon Lyrics|date=January 3, 2012|first=Gina|last=Serpe|publisher=[[E!|E!

On August 31, 2014, Green was criticized for tweets relating to his [[sexual battery]] court case. Two of his specific tweets regarding rape were "People who have really been raped REMEMBER!!!" and "If someone is passed out they're not even WITH you consciously! so WITH Implies consent." After sending a number of tweets on the topic of rape, he temporarily deactivated his [[Twitter]] account. He re-activated it a number of hours later, tweeting the following apology: "I truly and deeply apologize for the comments attributed to me on Twitter. Those comments were idiotic, untrue and not what I believe."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/02/cee-lo-green-it-isnt-if-the-victim-is-unconscious|title=Cee-Lo Green: It isn't rape if the victim is unconscious|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=September 2, 2014}}</ref>
