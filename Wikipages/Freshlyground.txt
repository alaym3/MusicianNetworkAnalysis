==History==
===''Jika Jika'' (2003)===
Freshlyground released their debut album, ''Jika Jika'', in early 2003. The commercial success of this album ultimately kick-started their career and re-affirmed their reputation as a fresh and vibrant young face in South African music. The commercial success of this album launched their career through their reputation as a vibrant South African band. The exposure from this album resulted in an invitation for the band to perform at both the [[Harare]] International Festival of the Arts and the [[Robben Island]] African Festival. This album was remixed by Keith Farquharson, remastered by Chris Athens and re-released in 2008.<ref>''Jika Jika'', 2008, album liner notes</ref>

===''Nomvula'' (2004–2006)===
In 2004, Freshlyground participated in the opening of [[Parliament of South Africa]] by perfoganised as a celebration of ten years of [[democracy]] in [[South Africa]].

At the [[Harare]] International Festival of the Arts ([[Harare International Festival of the Arts|HIFA]]), Freshlyground performed with [[Zimbabwe]]an musician [[Oliver Mtukudzi]].

The band went on to perform alongside local legend [[Miriam Makeba]], as well as [[Stanley Clarke]] and [[Femi Kuti]] at the North Sea Jazz Festival, held during April in [[Cape Town]]. July also marked a break from the recording studio for the band, who had been working hard on their then unreleased album ''Nomvula''. The band took this time to perform at the Villa Celimontana Festival in [[Rome]], [[Italy]].

Finally, in late 2004, Freshlyground released their very successful album, ''Nomvula''. Although the uptake of the album was initially slow, it eventually went on to achieve [[double platinum]] status locally. Initial success was largely due to the catchy, feel-good, lyrics of ''Doo Be Doo'', which enjoyed significant play on local radio, it was also covered in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] by singer [[Gita Gutawa]]. Follow-up hits included ''I'd like'' and the signature track ''Nomvula'', the former achieving unprecedented success on radio charts such as the [[5FM]] Top 40, where it remained at No. 1 for several weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.5fm.co.za/music/MusicChartsDetails.aspx?id=1|title=5FM Top 40 Chart|access-date=1 March 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927044106/http://www.5fm.co.za/music/MusicChartsDetails.aspx?id=1|archive-date=27 September 2006}}</ref>

===''Ma'Cheri'' (2007)===
The album ''Ma'Cheri'' was released on 3 September 2007.  The album was again produced by JB Arthur and Victor Masondo, engineered by David Langemann and was recorded in [[Cape Town]]. The first single is called ''Pot Belly'' followed by ''Fired Up'' and ''Desire''.

===''Radio Africa'' (2010)===
Freshlyground's album ''Radio Africa'' was released in May 2010, and as part of the album release, they released a collaborative music video with the ''ZANews'' puppeteers. A satirical track about Robert Mugabe (Chicken to Change) has received coverage in the British media.

===Cape Town Stadium Soccer Festival===
On 23 January 2010, Freshlyground performed at the official inauguration game at the new [[Cape Town Stadium]], where local Cape Town football clubs [[Ajax Cape Town]] and [[Engen Santos|Santos]] played each other in a match decided on penalties.

===2010 FIFA World Cup===
A song by Colombian pop star [[Shakira]] and Freshlyground was the official song of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]. The song, titled "[[Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)]]", is based on "[[Zamina mina (Zangalewa)|Zangalewa]]", a popular [[Makossa]] African soldiers' song by [[Golden Sounds]]. "Zangalewa" was a hit single in Colombia in 1987. Shakira and Freshlyground performed the song at the pre-tournament kick-off concert in Soweto on 10 June.

The following July, the band also took part in the official handing-over ceremony,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/Entertainment/Local/0,6119,2-1225-1242_1959219,00.html|title=News24 Article on 2010 handover|access-date=1 July 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001000217/http://www.news24.com/News24/Entertainment/Local/0,6119,2-1225-1242_1959219,00.html|archive-date=1 October 2007}}</ref> which took place in [[South Africa]].

===''The Legend'' (2013)===
"This album captures the emotion, the passion and the energy of our live performances", explains violinist Kyla-Rose Smith adding, "our live concerts have always been at the bedrock of our popularity", she says.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://freshlyground.com/shop/shop/album-the-legend/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-05-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514221738/http://freshlyground.com/shop/shop/album-the-legend/ |archive-date=14 May 2014}}</ref>

==Honours==
In 2005, Freshlyground was nominated for three [[South African Music Awards]] for their 2004 album, ''Nomvula''. Although they won no SAMAs that year, in 2008 the [[Recording Industry of South Africa]] awarded them the coveted Best Duo or Group SAMA. In the same year, their 2007 album ''Ma' Cheri'' won the prestigious Album of the Year SAMA, as well as Best Adult Contemporary Album: English, and Best Engineer.

At the 2006 [[MTV Europe Music Awards]] in Copenhagen, Freshlyground became the first South African musical act to receive honours from [[MTV]], when they received the [[MTV Europe Music Award for Best African Act]].
