==History==
Thank You Scientist was formed at the New Jersey Montclair State University's music program, when guitar player Tom Monda met saxophonist Ellis Jasenovic and trumpet player Andrew Digrius. Their musical taste for [[Frank Zappa]], [[Harry Nilsson]], [[the Beatles]] and [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]] would later become an influence and a seed for Thank You Scientist.

In 2009 vocalist Salvatore Marrano (former vocalist of New Jersey rock band "Hello Eden"), bass player Greg Colacino, drummer Odin Alvarez and violin player Russ Lynch joined the band, which became the original lineup for Thank You Scientist. The band self-released their "The Perils of Time Travel" EP in 2011, followed shortly after by their first full-length album "Maps of Non-Existent Places" in 2012. This album caught the attention of [[Claudio Sanchez]], vocalist and guitarist for the progressive metal/rock group [[Coheed and Cambria]] and founder of Evil Ink Records, who brought band to the label as its first signed act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://evilinkrecords.com/tysvinyl|title=Evil Ink signs Thank You Scientist|access-date=October 18, 2018}}</ref> A music video for "My Famed Disappearing Act" was released in August 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://evilinkrecords.com/thank-you-scientist|title=Thank You Scientist Bio|access-date=October 18, 2018}}</ref> The digital re-release of the album was on September 16, 2014.<ref>{{cite web |last1=j |title=Thank You Scientist - Maps of Non-Existent Places (2012; 2014 reissue) |url=https://somethingelsereviews.com/2014/09/16/thank-you-scientist-maps-of-non-existent-places-2012-2014-reissue/ |website=Something Else! |access-date=8 November 2021 |date=16 September 2014}}</ref>

The album was released June 14, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ewing|first=Jerry|date=April 12, 2019|title=Thank You Scientist premiere video for new song FXMLDR with Prog|url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/thank-you-scientist-premiere-video-for-new-song-fxmldr-with-prog|access-date=April 13, 2019|website=[[Prog (magazine)|Prog]]}}</ref> The band also released a video for "FXMLDR" made with solar equipment and in conjunction with Bluecoats Drum and Bugle Corps.
