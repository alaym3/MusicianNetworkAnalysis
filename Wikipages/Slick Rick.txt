He rose to prominence with [[Doug E. Fresh|Doug E. Fresh & the Get Fresh Crew]] in the mid-1980s. Their songs "[[The Show (Doug E.

He was one of the very first hip-hop artists to be covered, when Snoop Dogg (then Snoop Doggy Dogg) rapped Rick's lyrics from his record "La Di Da Di" almost in their entirety on the track 'Lodi Dodi' on his debut album ''[[Doggystyle]]'' in 1993.

==Early life==
Walters was born in the southwest London district of [[Mitcham]] to [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] parents on 1 Brad Gibson street. He was blinded in the right eye by broken glass as an infant.<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p97|pure_url=yes}} |first=John |last= Bush |title=Slick Rick Biography and History|website=AllMusic|access-date=April 11, 2016}}</ref> In 1976, he and his family migrated to the United States, settling in the [[Baychester]] area of [[the Bronx]].<ref name="dgonzalez">David Gonzalez, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/09/nyregion/at-50-slick-rick-a-hip-hop-pioneer-still-has-stories-to-tell.html?ref=arts&_r=1 "At 50, a Hip-Hop Pioneer Still Has Stories to Tell,"] ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 8, 2015.</ref> At [[The High School of Music & Art|Fiorello H.

At a 1984 talent showcase he entered, Rick met [[Doug E. Fresh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/279586/slick-rick/biography|title=Slick Rick - Biography|website=Billboard.com|access-date=April 11, 2016}}</ref> Impressed by Rick's talent, Doug made him a member of his Get Fresh Crew (which also included DJs Chill Will and Barry Bee). Doug's beatbox and Rick's fresh flow turned "[[The Show (Doug E. Fresh song)|The Show]]"/"[[La Di Da Di]]" into international anthems that turned rap music on its head and became the launching pad for "Hip Hop's greatest storyteller."<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|first=Steve|last=Huey |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-great-adventures-of-slick-rick-mw0000198545 |title=The Great Adventures of Slick Rick - Slick Rick &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=August 13, 2015}}</ref>

== Career ==
===Initial fame===
His career began in 1985; Walters first gained success in the rap industry after joining [[Doug E. Fresh]]'s Get Fresh Crew, using the stage name MC Ricky D. He was featured on the single "[[The Show (Doug E. Fresh song)|The Show]]" and its even more popular [[B-side]], "[[La Di Da Di]]", which featured Walters' rapping over Doug E. Fresh's [[beatbox]].  Both tracks gained some mainstream attention, they appeared on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11mjaLQWZ6U |title=Doug E Fresh & The Get Fresh Crew -The Show Studio, TOTP |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=April 19, 2014 |access-date=July 13, 2017}}</ref> and ''[[Soul Train]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Pmp8VtJwI |title=The Show - Doug E Fresh |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=February 10, 2011 |access-date=July 13, 2017}}</ref> with the Get Fresh Crew. Reflecting on the double-sided gem in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine, Roots drummer and ''Tonight Show'' bandleader Ahmir "Questlove" Thompson said, "Point blank: Slick Rick's voice was the most beautiful thing to happen to hip-hop culture [...] Rick is full of punchlines, wit, melody, cool cadence, confidence and style. He is the blueprint."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/questloves-top-50-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time-20121217/doug-e-fresh-and-the-get-fresh-crew-the-show-la-di-da-di-1985-19691231|title=Doug E.

In 1986, Slick Rick joined Russell Simmons's Rush Artist Management and became the third artist signed to [[Def Jam Records]],<ref name="Biography of Slick Rick"/> the leading rap/hip-hop label at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/features/top-ten-def-jams|title=Top Ten Def Jams|website=Clash Magazine|access-date=April 11, 2016}}</ref> Collaborating with his friend, DJ Vance Wright, Walters produced his solo debut, ''[[The Great Adventures of Slick Rick]]'', which came out in 1988 on Def Jam.  The album was very successful, reaching the No.&nbsp;1 spot on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s R&B/Hip-Hop chart.  It also featured three charting singles: "[[Children's Story]]", "[[Hey Young World]]", and "[[Teenage Love (song)|Teenage Love]]". The release is known for its storytelling and vocal characterizations. "With the combination of Rick's Dick Van Dyke-on-dope accent and his unique narrative style, the record was an instant classic," wrote critic Matt Weiner. "Each of Rick's songs was an amusing, enthralling story that lasted from the first groove to the last."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sabotagetimes.com/music/the-misadventures-of-slick-rick|title=The Misadventures of Slick Rick|last=Weiner|first=Matt|date=September 21, 2014|website=Sabotagetimes.com|access-date=April 11, 2016}}</ref>

===Incarceration and subsequent albums===
In 1989, Walters' mother, Veronica, hired his first cousin, Mark Plummer, as his bodyguard. By 1990, Plummer had become a liability, having tried numerous times to extort money from the artist.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/10/the-30-biggest-criminal-trials-in-rap-history/slick-rick|title=The 30 Biggest Criminal Trials in Rap History - 5.

On July 3, 1990, Walters spotted Plummer in his neighborhood, and fired at least four shots. One bullet hit Plummer; another caught a passerby in the foot. Neither suffered life-threatening injuries.<ref name="auto"/>

He eventually pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted murder and other charges, including assault, use of a firearm, and criminal possession of a weapon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hiphop.sh/slickrick|title=Slick Rick The Ruler|website=hiphop.sh|access-date=April 11, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417060505/http://hiphop.sh/slickrick|archive-date=April 17, 2016}}</ref> The rapper called it an act of self-defense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/no-holds-barred-years-prison-slick-rick-cuts-art-storytelling-life-back-article-1.835620|title=No holds barred - after five years in prison, Slick Rick cuts ''Art of Storytelling'' - and gets his life back|website=NY Daily News|access-date=April 11, 2016}}</ref> He spent five years in prison, two for the then-second-degree attempted-murder charges he received for the shooting, and three for his struggle with the [[Immigration and Naturalization Services]] over his residency in the U.S. He was released from prison in 1997.<ref name="schan">Sewell Chan, [http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/23/governor-pardons-hip-hop-pioneer/?_r=0 "Governor Pardons Hip-Hop Pioneer,"] ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 23, 2008.</ref>

After being bailed out by [[Russell Simmons]], Walters recorded his second album, ''[[The Ruler's Back]]'', released in 1991. Despite peaking at No.&nbsp;29 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defjam.com/releases/the-rulers-back/|title=The Ruler's Back - Def Jam|website=Def Jam|language=en-US|access-date=April 11, 2016}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> the album received mixed reviews and was not as commercially successful as his debut. In the documentary film, ''[[The Show (1995 film)|The Show]]'', Russell Simmons interviewed Walters while he was imprisoned on [[Rikers Island]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Slick Rick Interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1shUovH_hao|work=The Show|publisher=youtube.com|access-date=March 18, 2012}}</ref>

Walters' third studio album (the fourth for Def Jam) ''[[Behind Bars (Slick Rick album)|Behind Bars]]'' was released in 1994,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Slick_Rick.aspx|title=Slick Rick Facts, information, pictures on Encyclopedia.com articles about Slick Rick|website=Encyclopedia.com|access-date=April 11, 2016}}</ref> while he was still incarcerated. It was met with lukewarm sales and reviews. ''Behind Bars'' peaked at No.&nbsp;11 on the ''Billboard'' [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart, and No.&nbsp;51 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defjam.com/releases/behind-bars/|title=Behind Bars - Def Jam|website=Def Jam|language=en-US|access-date=April 11, 2016}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Walters remained with the Def Jam label, and on May 25, 1999, released a fourth album, ''[[The Art of Storytelling]]''. Generally considered the authentic follow-up to his 1988 debut, ''The Art of Storytelling'' was an artistically successful comeback-album that paired him with prolific MCs like [[Nas]], [[OutKast]], [[Raekwon]], and [[Snoop Dogg]]. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' announced it as the "triumphant return of rap's premier yarn-spinner", calling the song "2 Way Street" "a much-needed alternative to rap's misogynistic slant".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/may/23/entertainment/ca-40001|title=Slick Rick Makes His Return to Rap, Ever the Storyteller|last=Baker|first=Soren|date=May 23, 1999|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=April 11, 2016}}</ref> It charted higher than any of Slick Rick's prior releases: No.&nbsp;8 on the ''Billboard'' 200; and No.&nbsp;1 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.

After performing on a Caribbean cruise ship in June 2001, Walters was arrested by the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] (INS) as he re-entered the United States through [[Florida]]. He was promptly told that he was being deported under a law allowing deportation of foreigners convicted of felonies. Rick was continuously refused bail, but after 17 months in prison he was released on November 7, 2003.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Music/11/04/slick.rick.ap/ |title=Slick Rick regains legal status |access-date=May 24, 2004 |agency=Associated Press |date=November 4, 2003 |work=CNN.com |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071206142745/http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Music/11/04/slick.rick.ap/ |archive-date = December 6, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1480288/20031107/story.jhtml |title=The Great Adventures Can Resume: Slick Rick Is A Free Man |access-date=May 24, 2008 |first=Joseph |last=Patel |date=November 7, 2003 |work=MTV.com}}</ref> In October 2006, the [[Department of Homeland Security]] began a new attempt to deport Walters back to the [[United Kingdom]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vibe.com/news/news_headlines/2006/10/slick_rick_facing_deportation_again/ |title=Slick Rick Facing Deportation, Again |access-date=May 24, 2008 |first=Alexis |last=Jeffries |date=October 18, 2006 |work=Vibe |publisher=Vibe Media Group, Inc |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203125624/http://www.vibe.com/news/news_headlines/2006/10/slick_rick_facing_deportation_again/ |archive-date=December 3, 2008 }}</ref> moving the case from the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] based in New York to the more conservative [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh Circuit]]. The court is based in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], but the trial was expected to proceed in Florida, where immigration agents originally arrested Walters.

On May 23, 2008, New York Governor [[David Paterson]] granted Slick Rick a full and unconditional pardon on the attempted murder charges. The governor was pleased with his behavior since the attempted murders. Slick Rick has volunteered his time to mentor kids about violence.<ref name="schan"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&id=6161854 |title=Hip-hop pioneer 'Slick Rick' pardoned |access-date=May 24, 2008 |agency=Associated Press |date=May 23, 2008 |work=ABC News}}</ref>

==Honors==
On October 6, 2008, Rick was honored on the [[VH1 Hip Hop Honors]] show.

==Rapping style==
Slick Rick's style is commended by music critics. Music journalist [[Peter Shapiro (journalist)|Peter Shapiro]] wrote, "&thinsp;'Children's Story' was important because of its narrative structure and Rick's understanding of how crucial little sonic details—such as his use of a female voice and his yawning rap—were to hip hop style."<ref name="Shapiro Rough 336">Shapiro, Peter. ''The Rough Guide To Hip-Hop, 2nd Edition'', Penguin, 2005, p.336.</ref>

He is largely known for his story raps, such as "Children's Story" and "La Di Da Di". Shapiro writes that he "largely introduced the art of narrative into hip hop... none of the spinners of picaresque rhymes who followed did it with the same grace or humor."<ref>Shapiro, Peter, 2005, ''The Rough Guide To Hip-Hop, 2nd Edition'', Penguin, p. 337.</ref> [[AllMusic]] states that he has the "reputation as hip hop's greatest storyteller."{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}<!-- Empty reference <ref name="ReferenceA"/>--> In the book ''[[Check the Technique]]'', Slick Rick says, "I was never the type to say freestyle raps, I usually tell a story, and to do that well I've always had to work things out beforehand."<ref name="Coleman, Brian 2007, p. 319">Coleman, Brian.

Slick Rick uses very clear enunciation and retains some English pronunciations, which led Shapiro to say that he raps in the "[[British English|Queen's English]]".<ref name="Shapiro Rough 336" /> [[O.C.
