'''Nada Surf''' is an American [[alternative rock]] band that consists of [[Matthew Caws]] (guitar, vocals), [[Ira Elliot]] (drums), [[Doug Gillard]] (guitar, backing vocals), and [[Daniel Lorca]] (bass, backing vocals). Based in [[New York City]] and formed in the 1990s, Nada Surf continues to tour. Their ninth album, ''Never Not Together'', was released on February 7, 2020.

==History==
===1990s===
Nada Surf was formed in 1992 by [[Matthew Caws]] and [[Daniel Lorca]]. They originally went by the name Helicopter but later changed it to Nada Surf, which Caws said is "actually referring to something much more existential, it's just surfing on nothing. Being lost in your head or in your imagination but you know, whenever I listen to music I always find myself off somewhere. Somewhere in space. You know, in mental space and it's a reference to that."<ref name=Toazted-mp3>{{cite web|title=Nada Surf Interview|url=http://www.toazted.com/player.php?mp3id=1096|work=Toazted.com|access-date=October 31, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060604214017/http://www.toazted.com/interview/699/Nada-Surf.html|archive-date=June 4, 2006|format=Audio interview|date=July 2005}}</ref> The members met in the [[Lycée Français de New York]]; both spent some of their childhood in France and [[Belgium]], and played in many bands, including The Cost of Living and Because Because Because. Their first drummer, Dan (later alluded to in the song "The Plan" from the album ''[[High/Low (Nada Surf album)|High/Low]]''), was replaced by Aaron Conte, with whom the band recorded their first 7", ''The Plan/Telescope'' (1994), as well as the demo tape ''Tafkans'', the raw version of ''High/Low''. Those raw versions were later released on their second 7", ''Deeper Well/Pressure Free'' (1995), on the EP ''[[Karmic (EP)|Karmic]]'', and on ''North 6th Street''.

In 1995, Conte left the band and was replaced by [[Ira Elliot]], former drummer of the [[Fuzztones]], a band from the 1980s [[New York City|New York]] scene, and of whom both Caws and Lorca were fans. After a [[Blonde Redhead]] show at the [[Knitting Factory]], Nada Surf met former [[The Cars|Cars]] frontman and [[Weezer]] producer [[Ric Ocasek]].<ref name="cawsoc">{{cite web |last1=Caws |first1=Matthew |title=The Time Ric Ocasek Helped My Band Make Its First Record |url=https://www.npr.org/2019/09/18/761688937/the-time-ric-ocasek-helped-my-band-make-its-first-record |website=NPR.org |access-date=September 18, 2019 |language=en}}</ref> With little hope, they presented him with a copy of ''Tafkans''. Three weeks later, Ocasek called back with news of his intention to produce the album.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lindsay |first1=Cam |title=Rank Your Records: Matthew Caws Orders Nada Surf's Records |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/6wqbq4/rank-your-records-nada-surf-matthew-caws |website=Noisey |access-date=September 17, 2019}}</ref> Soon after, the band was finalizing a contract with [[Elektra Records]] through an executive, [[Josh Deutsch]].

On June 18, 1996, they released their debut album, ''[[High/Low (Nada Surf album)|High/Low]]'', which was recorded and mastered within a nineteen-day period. Prior to this, the band released ''Karmic'' on No. 6 Records, a label run by Elektra A&R head [[Terry Tolkin]]. That summer, as Nada Surf toured the United States with [[Superdrag]], their song "[[Popular (Nada Surf song)|Popular]]" became a summer anthem, and the band toured overseas.

In 1998, they released ''[[The Proximity Effect (Nada Surf album)|The Proximity Effect]]'', their follow-up album, in Europe. Produced by [[Fred Maher]], the album gained little commercial success in the US. Their record label, thinking the album lacked a hit like "Popular", had the band record several covers, including "Black & White" ([[The dBs]]) and "Why Are You So Mean to Me?" ([[Vitreous Humor (band)|Vitreous Humor]]), to use as singles. Tired of the requirements of the A&R director, the band judged the album was perfect as-is (even though Elektra suggested the inclusion of an acoustic version of "Popular"), and broke their contract. As a consequence, Elektra did not release the album in the US and dropped the band while they were on a promotional tour in Europe. Despite these events, this album was critically acclaimed in France, where the band did a 30-show tour the following year.<ref name=DallasObs-SpinalTap>{{cite news|last=Freedman|first=Pete|title=Q&A: Nada Surf's Matthew Caws Wishes His Band Was Spinal Tap.

===2000s===
In 2000, Nada Surf released ''The Proximity Effect'' in the United States on their own label, MarDev (named after Caws' maternal grandmother, Margaret Devereux Lippitt, daughter of the painter [[Margaret Walthour Lippitt]]), after being dropped by Elektra. Subsequently, the band performed at their record release party at [[Luna Lounge]] in New York City and toured extensively for several months to rebuild their North-American fan base.

From 1999 to 2002, the band members took regular day jobs: Caws worked at a Brooklyn record store called Earwax,<ref name=ThirdCoast-MCint>{{cite web |last=Jayasuriya |first=Sahan |title=Still "Popular": An Interview with Nada Surf's Matthew Caws |work=Third Coast Daily |date=December 6, 2012 |location=Milwaukee |url=http://thirdcoastdaily.com/2012/12/still-popular-an-interview-with-nada-surfs-matthew-caws/

Caws later referred to these times as a period of luxury, and the record store job as his "favorite job ever."<ref name=PMatters-Toronto2012>{{cite web|last=MacIntyre|first=Dave|title=Nada Surf - 4 April 2012 - Toronto|url=http://www.popmatters.com/post/157151-nada-surf-4-april-2012-toronto/|work=Pop Matters|access-date=October 31, 2013|date=April 12, 2012}}</ref>

In 2002, they released ''[[Let Go (Nada Surf album)|Let Go]]'', a critically acclaimed album<ref name=Billboard-LetGo>{{cite news|last=R|first=C|title=Let Go|newspaper=Billboard|date=February 8, 2003}}</ref> that included the single "Inside of Love". They went on tour for several months, including many European festivals, in the summer of 2003. Mostly recorded the year before, the album was produced by their friends Louie Lino and Chris Fudurich, who had engineered ''The Proximity Effect''; the band paid them with $1 and $5 bills, the money earned from tour merchandise sales.

In 2005, Nada Surf released ''[[The Weight Is a Gift]]'', an album produced by [[Chris Walla]] (among others), and finished touring for this album in October of the following year.<ref name=Lazy-I-Elliot>{{cite web|last=McMahan|first=Tim|title=Nada Surf: Back to the Van|url=http://www.timmcmahan.com/nada.htm|work=Lazy-I.com|publisher=The Omaha Reader|access-date=October 31, 2013|date=February 22, 2006}}</ref> The record was made during a month spent at John Vanderslice's Tiny Telephone studio in San Francisco.<ref name=PopM-TenYrConv>{{cite web|last=Rubin|first=Joey|title=Finally Professional: A Conversation with Nada Surf at Ten Years Old|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/nada-surf-050930/|work=Pop Matters|access-date=October 31, 2013|date=September 29, 2005}}</ref>

In 2008, the band released ''[[Lucky (Nada Surf album)|Lucky]]'', an album made with producer [[John Goodmanson]] at the [[Robert Lang Studios]] in [[Seattle]], from material recorded the year before. That same year, their song "No Quick Fix" was featured as the Spinner MP3 of the Day, and they were featured on the cover of ''[[Beyond Race Magazine]]'' for the publication's winter issue.

===2010s===

In 2012, Caws, who had moved to England, recorded acoustic versions of five of the songs from ''The Stars Are Indifferent to Astronomy'' as b-sides, in collaboration with record producer [[Lee Russell (record producer)|Lee Russell]]. The material was released as ''The Dulcitone Files EP.''

Nada Surf's eighth studio album, ''You Know Who You Are'', with an official release date of March 4, 2016, was released for streaming in late February 2016.<ref name="npr2016">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/02/24/467800606/first-listen-nada-surf-you-know-who-you-are|title=Nada Surf, 'You Know Who You Are'|last=Heller|first=Jason|date=February 24, 2016|work=First Listen|publisher=[[NPR]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225211720/http://www.npr.org/2016/02/24/467800606/first-listen-nada-surf-you-know-who-you-are|archive-date=February 25, 2016}}</ref>

In 2018, for the 15th anniversary of ''[[Let Go (Nada Surf album)|Let Go]]'', the charity cover album ''Standing at the Gates: The Songs of Nada Surf's Let Go'' was released, benefiting [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] and [[Pablove Foundation|The Pablove Foundation]].

===2020s===
In November 2019, Nada Surf announced that their ninth studio album, ''[[Never Not Together]]'', would be released via [[Barsuk Records]] (US) and [[City Slang]] (UK) on February 7, 2020. At the time of the announcement, they released a new single and lyric video, "Something I Should Do". According to the band, their experience while celebrating the 15th anniversary of ''[[Let Go (Nada Surf album)|Let Go]]'' in 2017 pushed them into a different creative mindset. They recorded many demos before thinning down the selection in an effort to find focus.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.clashmusic.com/news/nada-surf-detail-new-album-never-not-together|title=Nada Surf Detail New Album 'Never Not Together'|website=Clash Magazine|language=en|access-date=November 24, 2019}}</ref> The band also announced a major world tour to celebrate the album's release, starting on January 14 in [[Seattle]], before moving through the US and also encompassing dates in the UK, Germany, Spain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nadasurf.com/tour-dates/|title=Nada Surf {{!}} Tour Dates|website=Nadasurf.com|access-date=November 24, 2019}}</ref> Another single followed in December, entitled "Looking for You", accompanied by a music video directed by the band themselves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://us2.campaign-archive.com/?e=f5773b71f3&u=a3c201e80eb769c30991a6410&id=4633c37ad6|title=NEW MUSIC from the iconic Nada Surf.|website=us2.campaign-archive.com|access-date=January 20, 2020}}</ref>

Nada Surf opened the new decade with a single release, "So Much Love", on January 8, the third from ''Never Not Together''.
