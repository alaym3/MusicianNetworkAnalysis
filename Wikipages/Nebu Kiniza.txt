Nebu Kiniza's family moved from Queens to Pawling, NY and then to Conyers, a suburb of [[Atlanta]], GA, when he was 10.<ref name="allhiphop1">Yohance Kyles, "[https://allhiphop.com/2015/12/10/exclusive-atlriseup-nebu-kiniza-oshs-atlanta-sonny-digital-ilovemakonnen/ Nebu Kiniza Is Building An Artistic Empire From The Ground Up]," AllHeavymetal, 10 December 2015, retrieved 7 March 2017</ref> He learned the ropes of the music business from his mother, a singer. Attending [[Rockdale County High School]], he began freestyling at 15 and discovered his talent.

==Career==
He released his first track, "IDGAF," in 2011, and his first [[mixtape]], ''2 Peace Signs'', in 2012.

In 2013, he released his second mixtape, ''The Honor Roller'', with music videos for the tracks "The Grind" and "Steez." The "Steez" video, shot in Atlanta's [[Little Five Points]] neighborhood, received over 300,000 views on [[YouTube]].

His third mixtape, ''Hypnosis'', which featured production from American record producer [[Sonny Digital]], was released in 2014. The track "Myself" became his first major hit and was remixed by [[ILoveMakonnen]] & Key!.

Along the way Nebu created his own label, On Some Hippy Sh*t, for himself and his crew of producers.

His biggest hit to date, "Gassed Up," produced by MexikoDro – a track that he has said took all of 15 minutes to create<ref>Ural Garrett, "[http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.41465/title.nebu-kinizas-gassed-up-took-15-minutes-to-create-racked-up-millions-of-streams Nebu Kiniza’s "Gassed Up" Took 15 Minutes To Create & Racked Up Millions Of Streams]," HipHipDX, 29 November 2016, retrieved 7 March 2017</ref> – received over 52 million listens on [[SoundCloud]], 34 million views on YouTube and 80 million plays on [[Spotify]].

With respect to his moniker, he explained that his aunt jokingly suggested naming him after King Nebuchadnezzar when he was born. He thus felt identified with the name for his whole life, and adapted it for real when it was time to adopt a stage name. "Nebu stands for the golden one. Kiniza stands for being originally creative and artistic. So I put two-and-two together."<ref name="allhiphop1"/>

==Stage name==
His stage name references the biblical King [[Nebuchadnezzar II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/7503913/nebu-kiniza/biography |title=Nebu Kiniza - Biography |publisher=Billboard |date= |accessdate=2003-06-14}}</ref>
