'''Gojira''' is a French [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Ondres]]. Founded as '''Godzilla''' in 1996, the band's lineup&mdash;brothers [[Joe Duplantier|Joe]] (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) and [[Mario Duplantier]] (drums), [[Christian Andreu]] (lead guitar), and [[Jean-Michel Labadie]] (bass)&mdash;has been the same since the band changed its name to Gojira in 2001. Gojira has been known for their [[Progressive metal|progressive]] and [[technical death metal]] styles and their [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and [[Environmentalism in music|environmentally-themed lyrics]]. The band has gone "from the utmost obscurity during the first half of their career to widespread global recognition in the second".<ref name="AllMusic-bio">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=mn0000721409|tab=biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Gojira {{!}} Artist Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|last1=Buchanan|first1=Jonathan D.|access-date=30 October 2021}}</ref>

Gojira's first two albums, ''[[Terra Incognita (Gojira album)|Terra Incognita]]'' (2001) and ''[[The Link (album)|The Link]]'' (2003), and powerful live performances established their reputation as a leading French metal band. ''[[Maciste All'Inferno (album)|Maciste All'Inferno]]'' was a silent [[film score]] composed and performed for a one-night show in [[Bordeaux]]. Their third album, the critically-acclaimed ''[[From Mars to Sirius]]'' (2005) with "Backbone", "The Heaviest Matter of the Universe", and "Flying Whales", was covered in the British metal press. Gojira then signed with [[Prosthetic Records]], which gave them visibility in North America. The follow-up album, ''[[The Way of All Flesh (album)|The Way of All Flesh]]'' (2008), charted on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and the band later launched their first overseas headlining tour.

Gojira began recording the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society|Sea Shepherd]] [[Extended play|EP]] in a collaborative framework involving several metal musicians. In 2011, Gojira signed with [[Roadrunner Records]]. The band released ''[[L'Enfant Sauvage (album)|L'Enfant Sauvage]]'' (2012) and ''[[Magma (Gojira album)|Magma]]'' (2016), which peaked at number thirty-four and twenty-four respectively on the ''Billboard'' 200. Gojira shelved [[death metal]] in favor of a more straightforward style on ''Magma'', the band's breakthrough album. In 2020, they released their first {{nowrap|''Billboard''-charting}} single, "Another World". The chart-topping ''[[Fortitude (album)|Fortitude]]'' (2021) was the [[Top Album Sales#2021|best-selling album]] in the US during its first week. With a [[Do it yourself|DIY approach]], Gojira produce their albums at their own recording studios in France and New York City.

The band has released seven studio albums, three live DVDs, and is the first French band to top the [[Billboard charts#Albums|''Billboard'' Hard Rock Albums]] chart. Gojira is considered one of France's most successful exports to the US. The band has received [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] nominations for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]] for ''Magma'' and [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance|Best Metal Performance]] for the singles "Silvera" and "Amazonia". Gojira holds the record for the loudest concert (and sound) ever recorded at the [[Stade de France]]. Throughout their career, the band has been involved in [[Environmental movement|environmental]], [[Human rights|human-]] and [[Animal rights movement|animal-rights]] activism.<!--PER WP:LEADCITE, INFO IN THE LEAD IS CITED IN THE BODY-->

Mario Duplantier called Death "an obligatory path; they are at the origin of death metal", and Andreu agreed: "It's our culture, we come from Death." One of Labadie's earliest influences was Metallica's ''[[Ride the Lightning]]'', the first metal album he listened to at age eleven. Joe Duplantier said that "''Ride the Lightning'' saved my life when I faced difficult times in high school"<ref name="Soenen2016-06-10"/> and has also cited Machine Head's 1994 album, ''[[Burn My Eyes]]'', as an influence.

In recollecting Gojira's early history, Joe Duplantier explained how they were "nourished by the rock energy of the Basque Country, fairly unique in France," but, by contrast, compared it to the broader context of their lifestyle, secluded in a forest with their American musical influences while being detached from the local scene. He said: "Thus, we created our own language, our own musical codes. The Gojira sound comes from there."<ref name="Soenen2016-06-24"/>  Andreu and Joe and Mario Duplantier described [[classical music]] as a particular inspiration;<ref name="Colombani2016-06-10"/> Andreu said, "I listen to 70 percent classical music".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Jagunk|first=Yoch|date=24 August 2009|title=Discussion - Gojira (Interview with Christian Andreu)|url=https://issuu.com/zyva/docs/zyva1/28|language=fr|magazine=Zyva Magazine|location=[[Lyon]]|publisher=[[Issuu]]|page=28|oclc=743017035|access-date=2 February 2021}}</ref> About Gojira's songs, which rely on [[syncopation]] and ''contretemps'' ([[Beat (music)#On-beat and off-beat|on- and off-beats]]), Mario Duplantier said: "Joe and I were introduced to classical very early on.

There is a strong link between metal and classical music through [their] solemn side and attention paid to existential subjects: life and death. Pop [music] is more focused on romantic feelings."<ref name="Colombani2016-06-10"/> 

By 2016, the band had admitted their interest in the music of [[the Beatles]].<ref name="Colombani2016-06-10">{{cite news|last=Colombani|first=Franck|date=10 June 2016|title=Gojira: 'Le metal, c'est de la dentelle'|trans-title=Gojira: 'Metal, it is lace'|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/musiques/article/2016/06/16/gojira-le-metal-c-est-de-la-dentelle_4951952_1654986.html|url-status=live|language=fr|work=[[Le Monde]]|location=Paris|archive-url=https://archive.today/20160617224915/http://www.lemonde.fr/musiques/article/2016/06/16/gojira-le-metal-c-est-de-la-dentelle_4951952_1654986.html|archive-date=17 June 2016|access-date=13 November 2021}}</ref> Gojira also named [[Pink Floyd]]<ref name="Marraud2017-01-22"/> and Mike Oldfield as influences.{{sfn|Blanchard|2016|p=40}} On ''Fortitude'', they focused on the lingering influence that the "classic" rock bands of the 1970s and 1980s had on them.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kajzer |first=Jackie |author-link=Full Metal Jackie |date=22 March 2021 |title=Gojira's Joe Duplantier Wants 'Fortitude' Album to Inspire the Best in People |url=https://loudwire.com/gojira-joe-duplantier-fortitude-album-full-metal-jackie-2021-interview/ |url-status=live |work=Loudwire |archive-url=https://archive.today/20210508233713/https://loudwire.com/gojira-joe-duplantier-fortitude-album-full-metal-jackie-2021-interview/|archive-date=8 May 2021 |access-date=13 November 2021}}</ref> The British sound continued to inspire the band's writing, citing [[Radiohead]] and [[trip hop]] act [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]].

The Duplantier brothers said that their upbringing in a Landes house "lost in the forest, with no neighbors," was reflected in Gojira's music and lyrics. Their father, Dominique Duplantier, was a French [[Architectural drawing|architectural drafter]] and painter; their mother, Patricia, was an American with [[Azores|Azorean]] roots. Mario Duplantier described his mother as

<blockquote>&nbsp;... a very free spirit, who has always encouraged our creativity. On the one hand, we had this extroverted mother who drew, sculpted, and made magnificent paintings out of driftwood; on the other hand [we had] a silent, "workaholic" father who could spend whole days on gigantic drawings in Chinese ink with an almost-worrying rigor. These two aspects of our upbringing are found in Gojira, a mixture of discipline and something more extroverted, wacky, and chaotic.<ref>{{cite news|last=Soenen|first=Marie-Hélène|date=8 July 2016|title=Gojira, une affaire de famille|trans-title=Gojira, a family affair|url=https://www.telerama.fr/musique/gojira-artistes-de-mere-en-fils-et-de-pere-en-fille,143998.php|url-status=live|language=fr|work=[[Télérama]]|location=Paris|archive-url=https://archive.today/20201212133248/https://www.telerama.fr/musique/gojira-artistes-de-mere-en-fils-et-de-pere-en-fille,143998.php|archive-date=12 December 2020|access-date=20 November 2021}}</ref></blockquote>

==Activism==
Gojira was involved in action against injustices and social inequalities.
