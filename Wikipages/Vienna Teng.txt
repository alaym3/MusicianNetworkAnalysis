A native of [[Saratoga, California]], she began playing [[classical piano]] at the age of five. Both her parents came from [[Taiwan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://viennateng.com/bio/|title=Bio|website=Vienna Teng|access-date=August 4, 2018}}</ref> She was [[salutatorian]] at [[Saratoga High School (California)|Saratoga High School]]. In 1996, while pursuing a degree in [[computer science]] at [[Stanford University]], Teng joined the [[Stanford Harmonics]], a student-run ''a cappella'' group.

She began recording her compositions at the studios in Stanford's [[Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA)]], intending to distribute her music on campus.
Many of these recordings were eventually released in her début album ''Waking Hour''.
After graduating in 2000, Teng worked as a software engineer for [[Cisco Systems]] in San Jose, but she continued to write music and perform in her free time.

In 2002, Teng signed with [[Virt Records]] and quit Cisco Systems to focus on her musical career.

==Career==
===''Waking Hour'' and ''Warm Strangers''===
Teng's first major national exposure was on [[National Public Radio]]'s ''[[Weekend Edition]]'' in January 2003, followed shortly thereafter by [[CBS]]'s ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]].'' She has since made appearances on the [[CBS]] Saturday ''[[Early Show]]'', [[CNN]]'s ''[[NewsNight with Aaron Brown]]'' and ''[[The Wayne Brady Show]]'', and opened concerts for [[Joan Baez]], [[Shawn Colvin]], [[Joan Osborne]], [[India.Arie]], [[Brandi Carlile]], [[Sarah Harmer]] and [[Marc Cohn]]. Although nearly all of Teng's recordings are in English, ''Warm Strangers'' features a [[hidden track|hidden]] cover of "[[Green Island Serenade]]", a 1950s Taiwanese classic performed in [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin Chinese]].

===''Dreaming Through the Noise''===
In 2006, Teng signed with [[Rounder Records|Zoë/Rounder]].<ref name="Rounder signing">{{cite web|url=http://www.rounder.com/index.php?id=news.php&newsId=539|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222649/http://www.rounder.com/index.php?id=news.php&newsId=539|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 27, 2007|title=Zoë/Rounder Records Signs Vienna Teng | access-date= December 2, 2006 }}</ref> From December 2006 to early 2007, Teng toured extensively in the United States to promote the release of her third album, ''Dreaming Through the Noise''.

===''Inland Territory'' and Study at the University of Michigan===
Her fourth album, ''Inland Territory,'' was released in 2009. Teng stated that the lyrics to "Grandmother Song" from ''Inland Territory'' are nearly a verbatim translation of a lecture that Teng received from her Mandarin-speaking grandmother, voicing her disapproval of Teng's career choice.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

In 2010, Teng announced to her fans that she had been accepted into the [[Erb Institute]] for Global Sustainable Enterprise at the [[University of Michigan]]. Through the program, she received an MBA from the [[Ross School of Business]] and an [[Master of Science|MS]] from the [[University of Michigan School of Natural Resources and Environment|School of Natural Resources and Environment]]. During this period, Teng moved to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], where she continued to perform and compose music, although she did not tour as frequently as she had before enrolling. After graduating from the University of Michigan in 2013, she worked at [[McKinsey & Company]] full-time in the area of renewable energy.

===''Aims''===
Teng's fifth studio album, titled ''[[Aims (album)|Aims]]'', was released in September 2013. From September to December 2013 Teng went on a tour across the United States and Western Europe to promote the new material. During this tour, she performed as a trio with Alex Wong and Jordan Hamlin, two other musicians who appeared on the album.
