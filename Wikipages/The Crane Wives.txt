'''The Crane Wives''' is a four-piece Americana/folk band founded in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], United States in 2010.  They refer to themselves as a "home grown indie-folk outfit from [[Grand Rapids, MI|Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]] that defies musical stereotypes." They utilize three-part vocal harmonies and eclectic instrumentation.

==Career==

===Early history===
Emilee Petersmark (guitar/vocals) and Kate Pillsbury (guitar/vocals) were aspiring solo artists who were working in a [[Chinese restaurant]] in [[Grandville, Michigan]]. In an attempt to avoid waiting tables, they began performing weekends in the restaurant under the name ''The Crane Wives'' but were not well received.

The addition of Dan Rickabus (percussion/vocals), Ben Zito (bass), and Tom Gunnels (banjo) in late 2010 expanded upon the duo, but the name remained the same.

===Formation and ''Safe Ship, Harbored'' (2010–2011)===
Petersmark and Pillsbury, both students at [[Allendale, Michigan|Allendale's]] [[Grand Valley State University]],  joined fellow students Gunnels and Rickabus for the practice sessions in August 2010.<ref name="The Upbeat">Nicole Sanguin, [http://www.theoaklandpress.com/articles/2011/06/22/entertainment/doc4e021d884f455466536432.txt 'THE UPBEAT: The Crane Wives'], The Oakland Press, June 22, 2011. Retrieved 2012-05-08.</ref>  The band played a few shows around [[Grand Rapids, MI|Grand Rapids]], and soon after, friend and fellow GVSU student Ben Zito (who [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|ran sound]] for the band a few times) joined as the band's [[Bass guitar|bass]] player, completing the sound.<ref>[http://recoilmag.com/sensory_attack/00043_crane-wives/1034/ ]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref>

The upbeat sound, folk influence, and use of three-part harmony set the band apart in the indie rock-dominated [[Grand Rapids, MI|Grand Rapids]] music scene.  While the band's name came in part from [[The Decemberists]]' 2006 album, ''[[The Crane Wife]]'', the members claim a wide variety of influences: [[American folk music|folk]], [[blues]], [[ska]], [[Punk rock|punk]], and even [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]].<ref name="The Upbeat" />

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The Crane Wives Band - Colin Meloy Holding Safe Ship, Harbored CD.jpg|thumb|left|Meloy holding [[Safe Ship, Harbored]] at [[NPR]] Studios]] -->The Crane Wives released their first full-length CD, ''Safe Ship Harbored'', in May 2011.  The album was self-produced, backed primarily through donation of studio time from [[Sound Post Studios]], where Rickabus worked as a [[Audio engineering|sound engineer]], and also a generous response to the band's [[Kickstarter]] campaign.

In June 2011, the band received a degree of national attention when [[Colin Meloy]], lead singer of [[the Decemberists]], saw their album at [[NPR]] during an interview and had his picture taken with it.  In response to the photo, fans and other local artists mimicked Meloy's pose (profile, with ''Safe Ship, Harbored'' touching their noses) and posted their photos to [[Facebook]], creating a flood of support for the band.  (A month prior, they had tried to book an opening performance for The Decemberists at [[Calvin College]], but were unable to secure the spot.)<ref>{{cite web|author=Troy Reimink |url=http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2011/06/is_decemberists_leader_colin_m.html |title=Is Decemberists leader Colin Meloy a fan of Grand Rapids' the Crane Wives? |publisher=MLive.com |date=2011-06-14 |accessdate=2013-10-24}}</ref>

In a Facebook post by Dan on February 3, 2015 news came of Tom's departure.

:Hello friends, fans, this is Dan writing to you. I come bearing sad news. After over 4 years in The Crane Wives, our friend and banjo-player Tom Gunnels will no longer be with the band.

In an article on LocalSpins, it was said that The Crane Wives continue as a four-piece set.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://localspins.com/tom-gunnels-departs-crane-wives-band-continue-four-piece-recording-new-album/|title=Tom Gunnels departs the Crane Wives|date=3 January 2015}}</ref>
