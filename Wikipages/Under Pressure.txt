"'''Under Pressure'''" is a song by the British [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and singer [[David Bowie]]. Originally released as a single in October 1981, it was later included on Queen's 1982 album ''[[Hot Space]]''. The song reached number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]], becoming Queen's second number-one hit in their home country and Bowie's third, and also charted in the top 10 in more than ten countries.

The song has been described as a "monster rock track that stood out" on the ''Hot Space'' album, as well as "an incredibly powerful and poignant pop song".<ref name="banas"/><ref name="whatley"/> It has been critically acclaimed as one of both Queen and Bowie's best songs, with some even considering it one of the greatest songs of all time. "Under Pressure" was listed at number 31 on [[VH1]]'s 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s, and voted the second best collaboration of all time in a poll by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. In 2021 it was ranked number 429 on ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s list of [[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]. It was played live at every Queen concert from 1981 until the end of the band's touring career in 1986.<ref>[http://www.queenconcerts.com/live/queen/hotspaceus.html Queen live on tour: Hot Space (world)] Queen Concerts.

Retrieved 23 July 2011</ref> Live recordings appear on the Queen live albums ''[[Queen Rock Montreal]]'' and ''[[Live at Wembley '86]]''.

The song was included on some editions of Queen's first ''[[Greatest Hits (Queen album)|Greatest Hits]]'' compilations, such as the original 1981 Elektra release in North America. It is included on the band's compilation albums ''[[Greatest Hits II (Queen album)|Greatest Hits II]]'', ''[[Classic Queen]]'', and ''[[Absolute Greatest]]'' as well as Bowie compilations such as ''[[Best of Bowie]]'' (2002), ''[[The Platinum Collection (David Bowie album)|The Platinum Collection]]'' (2005), ''[[Nothing Has Changed]]'' (2014), ''[[Bowie Legacy|Legacy]]'' (2016), and ''[[A New Career in a New Town (1977–1982)|Re:Call 3]]'' (2017).

"Under Pressure" was sampled by American rapper [[Vanilla Ice]] for his 1990 single "[[Ice Ice Baby]]". Vanilla Ice initially did not credit Bowie or Queen for the sample, resulting in a lawsuit that gave Bowie and Queen songwriting credit. The song has been covered by the American rock bands [[My Chemical Romance]] and [[the Used]], and singer [[Shawn Mendes]], whose version featured singer [[Teddy Geiger]]. [[Xiu Xiu]] also covered the song with [[Swans (band)|Swans]] frontman [[Michael Gira]].

==Background and composition==
"Under Pressure" was recorded at [[Mountain Studios]] in [[Montreux]], Switzerland in July 1981.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=57, 291}} [[Queen (band)|Queen]], working on their 1982 album ''Hot Space'', had been working on a song called "Feel Like", but were not satisfied with the result.<ref>[http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/songs/unreleasedqueen.htm#feellike Unreleased Queen Tracks – Feel Like] Ultimate Queen.

Afterward, they worked together for a while and wrote the song.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=57}}<ref>Peter Freestone (2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=AH8zZsbmB98C&pg=PA78&dq=queen+and+bowie+under+pressure+montreux#v=onepage&q=queen%20and%20bowie%20under%20pressure%20montreux&f=false Freddie Mercury: an intimate memoir by the man who knew him best] p.78. Omnibus Press. Retrieved 15 January 2011</ref> The final version, which became "Under Pressure", evolved from a chance encounter<ref>Queen in Montreal - Commentary</ref> [[jam session]] that Bowie had with the band at Mountain. It was credited as being co-written by the five musicians. The [[scat singing]] that dominates much of the song is evidence of the jam-beginnings as [[improvisation]]. However, according to Queen bassist [[John Deacon]] (as quoted in a French magazine in 1984),<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.openculture.com/2014/06/the-making-of-under-pressure.html|title=The Making of Queen and David Bowie's 1981 Hit "Under Pressure": Demos, Studio Sessions & More|work=Open Culture|access-date=19 September 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> the song's primary musical songwriter was [[Freddie Mercury]] – though all contributed to the arrangement. As [[Brian May]] recalled to ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine in October 2008, "It was hard, because you had four very precocious boys and David, who was precocious enough for all of us. David took over the song lyrically. Looking back, it's a great song but it should have been mixed differently. Freddie and David had a fierce battle over that. It's a significant song because of David and its lyrical content."<ref>[http://www.queencuttings.com/dblog/articolo.asp?articolo=407 "Queen, The Second Coming"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727091412/http://www.queencuttings.com/dblog/articolo.asp?articolo=407 |date=27 July 2011 }}. ''Mojo'', October 2008,</ref> The earlier, embryonic version of the song without Bowie, "Feel Like", is widely available in bootleg form, and was written by Queen drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]].<ref>{{cite news |title=The Making of Queen and David Bowie's 1981 Hit "Under Pressure": Demos, Studio Sessions & More |url=http://www.openculture.com/2014/06/the-making-of-under-pressure.html |access-date=26 March 2019 |agency=Open culture.com}}</ref>

There has also been some confusion about who had created the song's [[bassline]]. John Deacon said (in Japanese magazine ''Music life'' in 1982) that David Bowie created it. In more recent interviews, Brian May and Roger Taylor credited the bass riff to Deacon. Bowie, on his website, said the bassline was already written before he became involved.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110309001056/http://www.queenzone.com/news/bowie-talks-about-under-pressure.aspx Bowie Talks About Under Pressure] Retrieved 15 January 2011</ref> Roger Taylor, in an interview for the BBC documentary ''Queen: the Days of Our Lives'', stated that Deacon did indeed create the bassline, stating that all through the sessions in the studio he had been playing the riff over and over. He also claims that when the band returned from dinner, Deacon, amusingly, forgot the riff, but fortunately Taylor was still able to remember it.<ref>O'Casey, Matt, dir. (2002) Queen – Days of Our Lives. Part 2. Queen Productions Ltd. Retrieved 9 June 2011</ref> Brian May clarified matters in a 2016 article for [[Mirror Online]], writing that it was actually Bowie, not Taylor, who had inadvertently changed the riff. The riff began as "Deacy began playing, 6 notes the same, then one note a fourth down". After the dinner break, Bowie changed Deacon's memory of the riff to "Ding-Ding-Ding Diddle Ing-Ding".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/brian-tells-how-david-bowie-7161073|title=Brian May tells how David Bowie and Queen wrote the legendary track Under Pressure|author=Brian May|date=11 January 2016|publisher=Mirror Online}}</ref>

== Reception ==
"Under Pressure" has received critical acclaim since its release, with multiple publications ranking it among Queen and Bowie's best songs and among the greatest songs of all time. On release, Sandy Robertson of ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' magazine called "Under Pressure" the "cornerstone" of its parent album.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Robertson |first=Sandy |title=Queen: ''Hot Space'' (EMI)**** |url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/queen-ihot-spacei-emi |magazine=[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]] |date=8 May 1982 |access-date=17 August 2021|via=Rock's Backpages {{subscription required}}}}</ref> Reviewing ''Hot Space'' decades later, [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] called "Under Pressure" as the album's "undeniable saving grace" and "the only reason most listeners remember this album".<ref name="hot space AllMusic">{{cite web |last1=Erlewine |first1=Stephen Thomas |author-link1=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |title=''Hot Space'' – Queen |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/hot-space-mw0000195391 |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=25 May 2019}}</ref> He described the song as "an utterly majestic, otherworldly duet{{nbsp}}... that recaptures the effortless grace of Queen's mid-'70s peak, but is underscored with a truly affecting melancholy heart that gives it a genuine human warmth unheard in much of their music."<ref name="hot space AllMusic" /> Similarly, Ned Raggett of AllMusic described the song as "anthemic, showy and warm-hearted, [and] a clear standout for both acts".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Raggett |first1=Ned |title="Under Pressure" – Queen / David Bowie |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/under-pressure-mt0044908466 |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=25 May 2019}}</ref>

Following [[Death of David Bowie|Bowie's death]] in 2016, Jack Hamilton of ''[[slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' called "Under Pressure" a "masterpiece" and is a reminder to the public that Bowie could be "wonderfully, powerfully human."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hamilton |first1=Jack |title="Under Pressure" Is a Reminder That David Bowie Could Also Be Wonderfully, Powerfully Human |url=https://slate.com/culture/2016/01/david-bowie-and-queens-under-pressure-is-the-greatest-song-he-never-put-on-an-album.html |website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |access-date=25 May 2019 |date=11 January 2016}}</ref> Jack Whatley wrote for ''Far Out Magazine'' "with all the animosity, wine, cocaine and vocal battles which helped come together to birth the song, what remains is an incredibly powerful and poignant pop song that we will likely not see matched in our lifetimes.

== Live performances ==
Although very much a joint project, only Queen incorporated the song into their live shows at the time. Bowie chose not to perform the song before an audience until the 1992 [[Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]], when he and [[Annie Lennox]] sang it as a duet (backed by the surviving Queen members).<ref name="Tribute"/> However, after Mercury's death and the ''[[Outside (David Bowie album)|Outside]]'' tour in 1995, Bowie performed the song at virtually every one of his live shows, with bassist [[Gail Ann Dorsey]] taking Mercury's vocal part. The song also appeared in set lists from [[A Reality Tour]] mounted by Bowie in 2004, when he frequently would dedicate it to Freddie Mercury. [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] have recently performed the song; and in summer of 2012, [[Queen + Adam Lambert]] toured, including a performance of the song by Lambert and Roger Taylor in each show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/reality-rocks/queen-adam-lambert-rock-london-queenbert-concert-094922439.html|author=Parker, Lyndsey|title=Queen + Adam Lambert Rock London With "Queenbert" Concert|date=12 July 2012|access-date=12 March 2013}}</ref> While Bowie was never present for a live performance of the song with Mercury, Taylor instead filled for backing vocals in unison with Mercury, as Mercury took over all of Bowie's parts.

=== Live recordings ===
* Queen first recorded a live version of the song at the [[Montreal Forum]] in Canada on 24 November 1981. This was included in the concert films ''[[We Will Rock You (video)|We Will Rock You]]'' and ''[[Queen Rock Montreal]]''.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/r1239496 Queen Rock Montreal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191018005645/https://www.allmusic.com/album/queen-rock-montreal-mw0000489040 |date=18 October 2019 }} ''Allmusic''. Retrieved 29 August 2011</ref> Incidentally it is one of the few times in concert where Mercury used [[falsetto]] in the song on the line "these are the days it never rains but it pours".
* A second live version of the song was recorded at [[Milton Keynes]], England, in 1982. This was released in 2004 on the live album/DVD ''[[Queen on Fire - Live at the Bowl]]''. Prior to the concert, rumours circulated that Bowie would appear with Queen to sing his parts on stage, but he probably did not even attend the concert.
* In September 1982 the band performed the song during an appearance on the [[Saturday Night Live (season 8)|eighth-season premiere]] of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', which turned out to be Freddie Mercury's final live performance with Queen in the United States.
* Later, Queen recorded a third live version of the song at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], London, in 1986. This was released on the live album/DVD ''[[Queen at Wembley|Live at Wembley Stadium]]''.<ref>[http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/songs/wembley.htm#under Live At Wembley 1986] Ultimate Queen.

''([[#Rah Mix|See below]])''
* During the [[Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]] in 1992, the surviving members of Queen along with Bowie and [[Annie Lennox]] (fulfilling Mercury's role) performed the song.<ref name="Tribute">[http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/videos/fmtributedvd.htm#under Under Pressure – The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717091143/http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/videos/fmtributedvd.htm#under |date=17 July 2012 }} Ultimate Queen.

* A version recorded by David Bowie's live band in 1995 was released on the bonus disc included with some versions of ''[[Outside (David Bowie album)|Outside – Version 2]]''. This live version was also released on the single "[[Hallo Spaceboy]]" in 1996.

===Rah Mix===
A remixed version (called the "Rah Mix") was issued in December 1999 to promote Queen's ''[[Greatest Hits III (Queen album)|Greatest Hits III]]'' compilation, reaching No. 14 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The video for the Rah Mix was directed by DoRo, featuring footage of Freddie Mercury from Queen's Wembley concert on 12 July 1986 and David Bowie at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert also at Wembley Stadium on 20 April 1992 spliced together using digital technology (with Annie Lennox carefully edited out). This version is featured on the ''Greatest Hits III'' compilation, the Rah Mix CD single (as an Enhanced CD video) and the 2011 iTunes LP edition of ''Hot Space''.

* The original single version appears on disc three of Bowie's ''[[The Platinum Collection (David Bowie album)|The Platinum Collection]]'' (2005). This disc was later released separately as ''[[The Best of David Bowie 1980/1987]]'' (2007).

* It was featured nearly in its entirety in the 2010 film ''[[It's Kind of a Funny Story (film)|It's Kind of a Funny Story]]'', initially as a 'cover' by the patients in a [[music therapy]] class at a New York City psychiatric ward, which the film transformed into the authentic song 'performed' by the patients, dressed in glam, in a near music-video style imaginary sequence (with David Bowie and Queen's original vocals and instrumentation).
* Featuring in ''[[Happy Feet Two]]'' in 2011, the song was also released in the [[Happy Feet Two#Soundtrack|film's soundtrack]].

==Charts==
In the U.K., "Under Pressure" was Queen's second number-one hit and Bowie's third. Queen's smash hit "Bohemian Rhapsody" reached number one in November 1975, just two weeks after Bowie's "Space Oddity" had done the same. Bowie also topped the British charts in August 1980 with "Ashes to Ashes", his [[answer song]] to "Space Oddity".<ref name=answer_tom>{{cite web |url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2002/06/25/music-124/ |title=He's Got More Channels | work=[[The Village Voice]] | date=5 June 2002 | access-date=3 April 2018 }}</ref>

Teddy 3|website=iTunes Store|access-date=27 October 2018}}</ref>

The song was released to coincide with the release of the film ''[[Bohemian Rhapsody (film)|Bohemian Rhapsody]]''. [[Universal Music Group]] released three tracks by different artists "channeling their inner [[Freddie Mercury]]"; this was the first installment, released in October 2018 followed by [[5 Seconds of Summer]]'s "[[Killer Queen#5 Seconds of Summer version|Killer Queen]]" cover track.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/music/2018/10/12/shawn-mendes-under-pressure-queen/|title=Shawn Mendes drops cover of Queen's 'Under Pressure' |work=EW|date=12 October 2018|access-date=27 October 2018}}</ref><ref name="Billboard Mendes Geiger">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8479646/shawn-mendes-teddy-geiger-under-pressure|title= Shawn Mendes and Teddy Geiger Pay Tribute to Queen With Acoustic 'Under Pressure' Cover: Listen|magazine=Billboard| date=12 October 2018|access-date=27 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/shawn-mendes-teddy-geiger-under-pressure-queen-david-bowie-736296/|title=Hear Shawn Mendes, Teddy Geiger Cover Queen's 'Under Pressure' |work=Rolling Stone|date=12 October 2018|access-date=27 October 2018}}</ref>

A portion of the profits from the "Under Pressure" cover was donated to Mercury Phoenix Trust, which was founded by Queen's Brian May and Roger Taylor (and the group's manager, Jim Beach) after Mercury's death to help fight [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] worldwide. Mendes said in a statement: "I am so honoured to be able to support the amazing legacy of Freddie and Queen by doing a cover of one of my favourite songs, 'Under Pressure'".<ref name="Billboard Mendes Geiger"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2018/10/shawn-mendes-under-pressure-queen-cover-video/|title= Watch Shawn Mendes and Teddy Geiger Cover Queen's 'Under Pressure'|work=Spin|date=12 October 2018|access-date=27 October 2018}}</ref>

===Reception===
Taylor Weatherby from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' called the track "breezy" and said "Mendes and Geiger put their voices at the forefront of the stripped-down rendition, with Mendes' falsetto and Geiger's 'raspier' tone complementing their plucky acoustic guitars."<ref name="Billboard Mendes Geiger"/>
