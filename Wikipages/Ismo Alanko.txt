'''Ismo Kullervo Alanko''' ({{IPA-fi|ˈismo ˈʔɑlɑŋko}}; born November 12, 1960) is a Finnish musician. He is known as the frontman of several bands, most famously [[Hassisen Kone]], [[Sielun Veljet]] and [[Ismo Alanko Säätiö]], as well as a successful solo artist.

Alanko is known for his versatility and interest in different musical styles. During his career he has recorded [[punk rock]], [[alternative rock]], [[progressive rock]], [[electronic music]], [[schlager]], [[dance music]], [[children's music]] and [[film score]]s. He has achieved eight [[platinum record]]s, 16 [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]]s and four [[Emma-gaala|Emma awards]].<ref name="pomus">Tero Valkonen on [http://pomus.net/001786 Pomus – Populaarimusiikin museo] – Retrieved on April 17, 2008</ref> Also a recognized lyricist, Alanko won the [[Juha Vainio]] Writer's Award (Juha Vainio -sanoittajapalkinto) in 2003 for his song texts.<ref>Pekka Nissilä: [http://www.elvisry.fi/032003/alanko.html Juha Vainion Rahaston tunnustuspalkinto Ismo Alangolle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211074630/http://www.elvisry.fi/032003/alanko.html |date=February 11, 2012 }}, ''SELVIS'' magazine 3/2003</ref>

In a ''[[City (magazine)|City]]'' magazine article in 1999, 43 Finnish journalists picked the top 99 Finnish rock artists. Ismo Alanko placed 20th, with his former bands Hassisen Kone and Sielun Veljet placing 12th and 4th, respectively.<ref>[http://www.city.fi/artikkeli/Suomipopin+99+suurinta/81/ Suomipopin 99 suurinta], ''City'' magazine 21/1999</ref>

Alanko comes from a musical family: of his two younger brothers, Petri Alanko is a reputed classical [[flautist|flute player]], [[Ilkka Alanko]] is the singer/guitarist of [[Neljä Ruusua]], and his sister Satu Alanko-Rautamaa a violinist, and a member or the [[Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra]].

== Biography ==
=== Background ===
Alanko was born on November 12, 1960 in [[Kerava]], but grew up in [[Joensuu]], [[North Karelia]].<ref>[http://yle.fi/elavaarkisto/?s=s&g=4&ag=26&t=477&a=3170 yle.fi – Elävä arkisto] – Retrieved on April 9, 2008</ref> As a 15-year-old he played in a band called Sight, already writing some of his own songs. In the Finnish Rock Championship, an annual competition for young musicians, the band finished second in the [[progressive rock]] category. After completing his secondary education degree (''[[ylioppilastutkinto]]''), he took a break from music to move to work in [[Stockholm]].<ref>[http://yle.fi/maanmainiot/henkilot/ismoalanko.html yle.fi – Maan mainiot] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319004844/http://www.yle.fi/maanmainiot/henkilot/ismoalanko.html |date=March 19, 2009 }} – Retrieved April 9 2008</ref>

=== Hassisen Kone ===
{{Main|Hassisen Kone}}
After returning to Finland in 1979, Alanko, then 19 years of age, gained immediate success as the singer, songwriter and rhythm guitarist of the [[New wave music|new wave]] group [[Hassisen Kone]]. They won the Finnish rock championship in 1980 and recorded three very successful albums, ''[[Täältä tullaan Venäjä]]'', ''[[Rumat sävelet]]'' and ''[[Harsoinen teräs]]'', where the band went from punk-related new wave to [[progressive rock]]. All three remain among the best-selling records in Alanko's career. Hassisen Kone disbanded in 1982.

=== Sielun Veljet ===
{{Main|Sielun Veljet}}
Soon after Hassisen Kone broke up, Alanko and former Hassisen Kone guitarist Jukka Orma started [[Sielun Veljet]]. Some of their early audience was expecting another Hassisen Kone, but instead the band played aggressive and repetitive [[post-punk]]. Only one Sielun Veljet album came close to reaching Hassisen Kone's album sales (''[[L'amourha]]'', 1985), but the band gained fame for their powerful, loud and intense live performances. The band toured constantly and played a wide variety of musical styles, including old [[schlager]] hits under the alias Kullervo Kivi & Gehenna. Sielun Veljet quit in 1991, after seven studio albums, two [[Extended play|EPs]], a [[box set]] and a 1991 documentary film titled ''Veljet''.

=== Solo career ===
Alanko's solo debut, ''[[Kun Suomi putos puusta]]'', was released in 1990. At this point Sielun Veljet still existed, but the band had become less and less active. After the band broke up, Alanko recorded the [[electronic music]] -influenced ''[[Jäätyneitä lauluja]]'' and toured Finland with his band that was named Tuonelan Lukio. The band's keyboardist was Izmo Heikkilä of the band [[Raptori]].<ref name="pomus"/> Alanko went on to release two more solo albums, ''[[Taiteilijaelämää]]'' (1995) and ''[[Irti]]'' (1996).

In 1997, a four-CD [[box set]] ''Alangolla – Ismo Alangon lauluja'' was released. It spanned his entire career starting from Hassisen Kone and including material from different side projects. Until then, very few Finnish artists had released a box set. Sielun Veljet had released ''[[Musta laatikko]]'' in 1991 and [[CMX (band)|CMX]] their collection ''[[Cloaca Maxima (album)|Cloaca Maxima]]'' in 1997.

Alanko's most popular song, "[[Pop-musiikkia]]", was recorded in 1997 with fellow rock stars [[Ilkka Alanko]] (of [[Neljä Ruusua]]), Kalle Ahola (of [[Don Huonot]]) and [[A. W. Yrjänä]] (of CMX) under the name Neljä baritonia (Four Baritones). The single has been [[Music recording sales certification|certified platinum]] in Finland<ref>[http://www.ifpi.fi/tilastot/kplista.html?action=vapaa&tyyppi=koti&haku=artisti&julkaisuntyyppi=single&teksti=Nelj%E4+baritonia ifpi.fi] – Retrieved on April 17, 2008</ref> and is one of the most successful songs of all time on the Finnish singles chart.<ref>[http://finnishcharts.com/bestall.asp finnishcharts.com] – Retrieved on April 17, 2008</ref>

In 2002, Alanko appeared on [[Timo Rautiainen]]'s [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]]-selling ''Tiernapojat'' play with [[Jarkko Martikainen]], [[Toni Wirtanen]] and Rautiainen himself, playing [[Herod the Great|King Herod]].

In 2009, Alanko continues his varied projects playing with contemporary Finnish artists. In April he joined former Alanko Säätiö percussionist Teho Majamäki onstage as Teholla at Helsinki's mini-festival Arctic Paradise Live, having the same evening performed a solo concert in the Ateneum Art Museum series (A Land Without Kantele) with resident houseband of Jarmo Saari (guitars), Arttu Tolonen (bass) and Abdissa "Mamba" Assefa (drums).

=== Ismo Alanko Säätiö ===
{{Main|Ismo Alanko Säätiö}}
In 1998, Alanko started the semi-ironically named [[Ismo Alanko Säätiö]] (Ismo Alanko Foundation). Though Säätiö performed many of Alanko's old hits, the arrangements were radically revamped to fit with their unique acoustic sound, heavily featuring the [[avant-garde]] [[accordion]] sound of [[Kimmo Pohjonen]], a successful artist in his own right. Even though Säätiö is a band, it can be said that it is a backing band for solo performances by Alanko, as members of the band have changed rapidly.

=== Ismo Alanko Teholla ===
In 2007, Alanko ended Säätiö in its current form, and began touring with multi-instrumentalist Teho Majamäki as "Ismo Alanko Teholla". The name of the band is a play on words, and can mean either "Ismo Alanko with Power" or "Ismo Alanko in ICU (Intensive Care Unit)".<ref>Tapio Ahola: [http://www.vertigo.cd/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2457&Itemid=27 Ismo Alanko Teholla – suuruudenhullu pienyhtye] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706220904/http://www.vertigo.cd/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2457&Itemid=27 |date=July 6, 2011 }}, ''Vertigo'', March 3, 2008</ref>

== Instruments ==
Alanko studied classical cello in his youth, but didn't pursue a classical career because he felt it would require too much practice. In Hassisen Kone and onwards, he has played rhythm guitar in his bands in addition to singing. He still occasionally plays the cello, as well as the piano, both in the studio and on live performances.

Alanko composed the music for the 2007 TV series ''Taivaan tulet'' by [[Kari Väänänen]]. Alanko also played all instruments for the score, except for flute parts that were played by his brother Petri. Alanko has said that the decision to play all the instruments himself came "out of curiosity".<ref>Sari Sainio: [http://www.aamulehti.fi/sunnuntai/teema/ihmiset_paajutut/4538543.shtml Vastavirtaan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511020858/http://www.aamulehti.fi/sunnuntai/teema/ihmiset_paajutut/4538543.shtml |date=May 11, 2008 }} – ''[[Aamulehti]]'', February 2, 2007</ref>
