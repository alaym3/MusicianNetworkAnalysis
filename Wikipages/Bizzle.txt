In January 2010, Bizzle released "You Got Some Explaining to Do" directed towards [[Jay-Z]], calling the rap icon out on his negative references towards Jesus and Christianity in his music. The video caused much controversy and generated a buzz that even Bizzle couldn't anticipate. He released a statement in an interview with AllHipHop.com.<ref>{{cite web|last=Watkins|first=Greg|title=Christian Rapper Explains Jay-Z Diss|url=http://allhiphop.com/2010/01/23/christian-rapper-explains-jay-z-diss/|website=AllHipHop|access-date=February 20, 2014}}</ref>

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Mark Felder was raised mostly by his mother in Los Angeles, California. His father stayed in Compton, California. As a child growing up, his family was quite poor living in [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] housing.<ref name=mystep>{{cite web|last=Felder|first=Mark|title=Truth or Dare|url=http://www.mystep.me/truth-or-dare/bizzle|work=My Step|access-date= February 20, 2014}}</ref>

Mark was around thirteen the first time he stepped in a music studio. Listening to [[Tupac Shakur|Tupac]], he began to establish a talent for writing rhymes but noticed that his content usually mimicked those he listened to, whether it was his uncle or other rappers. Topics like shooting or packing pistols.<ref name="mystep"/>

After graduating, Mark put out five mixtapes and began circulating them in malls, clubs, radio stations and anywhere else he could. He eventually got an opportunity to open up for [[Lil Wayne]] & [[Juelz Santana]] during their ''I Can't Feel My Face'' tour.<ref name="mystep"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|title=Lil Wayne, Juelz Santana May Turn Upcoming Mixtape into Full LP|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1535532/20060630/lil_wayne.jhtml|publisher=[[MTV News]]|date=July 5, 2006|access-date=March 28, 2008}}</ref><ref name="cant feel">{{cite news|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|title=Lil Wayne Plans His Own Leak; Cassidy's Live-From-Jail Rhymes|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/mixtape_monday/061107/|work=Mixtape Monday|publisher=[[MTV News]]|date=June 11, 2007|access-date=March 28, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412193956/http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/mixtape_monday/061107/|archive-date=April 12, 2008}}</ref> He also opened up for [[Lil Boosie]].<ref name=Biography>{{cite web|last=Felder|first=Mark|title=Biography|url=http://godovermoney.com/artists/|access-date= February 20, 2014}}</ref>

While trying to move his music, his financial situation got worse. As he stated in an interview, his "financial situation got so bad he was sleeping on a friend's floor and his car was a closet for his clothes."<ref>Thomasos, Christine.

===2004–08 L.A.V. Mixtapes===
Between the years 2004–2008 Bizzle released ''L.A.V. Mixtapes'' Volumes 1–5 in [[Southern California]]. He then released ''Dirty West Mixtapes'' 1 and 2 with J. Sin and 360 Records in [[Houston]], Texas, and returned to California to release, ''Certified Mixtape'''.<ref name="Biography"/>

In 2005 he was offered a deal by 360 Records out of Houston and declined.<ref name="Biography"/> Two years later, Bizzle had been offered a deal by [[Barry Hankerson]] to sign with [[Blackground]]/[[Universal Music Group|Universal]], but he also declined that offer.<ref name="Biography"/>

Bizzle spent three years preparing his debut album ''Grind Pays''. Multiple singles where spread causing his Myspace plays to increase over 500,000.<ref name="Biography"/>

===Conversion to Christianity===

{{quotation | Here is an excerpt from Mark's interview with [[The Christian Post]] explaining his conversion:

''"A woman who was a prostitute liked my music. I had friends that were getting paid in that way, (so) I fell into this situation where I was pretty much a pimp and she was my prostitute."

Although Bizzle, also known as Lavyss, admitted that he was able to gain fast money, that all came to an end when the prostitute asked him to pick up her brother at their family church. While Bizzle didn't automatically feel guilty for his lifestyle, the situation made him think twice about his path.

"''(Her brother) was a drummer in a church, that was her family's church. The problem was that I didn't feel as guilty as I should have," Bizzle recalled. "I knew it was wrong but because of the money that was coming in, I wasn't going to tell her what the Lord was telling me. Eventually I came to Christ after realizing how far I had gone from him. That scared me.''"''}}

Not long after, Mark established the God Over Money Records recording label and began making music with a different purpose.

===2008–11 ''The Jay-Z diss, The Messenger trilogy & Tough Love & Parables''===

The influence of his Christianity and Mark's exposure to the dark side of hip hop ultimately prompted his questioning of the dark imagery that appears to be promoted through the music of rappers like Kanye West, Rick Ross, and Jay-Z.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ihiphopmusic.com/bizzle-the-good-fight-album-cover-release-date.html |title=Bizzle 'The Good Fight' Album Cover + Release Date |publisher=Ihiphopmusic.com |date=March 19, 2013 |access-date=August 5, 2013}}</ref> On January 17, 2010 he released the track "You Got Some Explaining to Do", a song directed towards [[Jay-Z]], exposing him for his negative references towards Jesus in his lyrics.<ref>Thomasos, Christine.
