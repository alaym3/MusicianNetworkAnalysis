'''Robert Dwayne Womack''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|oʊ|m|æ|k}}; March 4, 1944 – June 27, 2014) was an American singer, songwriter, musician, and record producer. Starting in the early 1950s as the lead singer of his family musical group [[the Valentinos]] and as [[Sam Cooke]]'s backing guitarist, Womack's career spanned more than 60 years and multiple styles, including [[rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[soul music|soul]], [[rock and roll]], [[doo-wop]], and [[gospel music|gospel]].

Womack was a prolific songwriter who wrote and originally recorded, (with his brothers, the Valentinos), [[the Rolling Stones]]' first UK number one hit, "[[It's All Over Now]]" and [[New Birth (band)|New Birth]]'s "[[I Can Understand It]]". As a singer, he is most notable for the hits "[[Lookin' for a Love]]", "[[That's the Way I Feel About Cha]]", "[[Woman's Gotta Have It (song)|Woman's Gotta Have It]]", "[[Harry Hippie]]", "[[Across 110th Street (song)|Across 110th Street]]", and his 1980s hits "[[If You Think You're Lonely Now]]" and "[[I Wish He Didn't Trust Me So Much]]".

In 2009, Bobby Womack was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

==Early life==

Born in Cleveland's [[Fairfax, Cleveland|Fairfax]] neighborhood, near East 85th Street and Quincy Avenue, to Naomi Womack and Friendly Womack, Bobby was the third of five brothers.<ref name="soulwalking1">{{cite web |url=http://www.soulwalking.co.uk/Valentinos.html |title=The Valentino's Page|publisher=Soulwalking.co.uk |access-date=April 11, 2012}}</ref> Friendly Jr. and Curtis were Bobby's older brothers, and [[Harry Womack|Harry]] and [[Cecil Womack|Cecil]] were his younger brothers. They all grew up in the Cleveland slums, so poor that the family would fish pig snouts out of the local supermarket's trash. He had to share a bed with his brothers.<ref name=RollingStone>{{cite news|last=  Edwards|first= Gavin |title= Bobby Womack (1944-2014)|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bobby-womack-1944-2014-20140628|access-date=April 24, 2015|newspaper=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 28, 2014}}</ref> His mother told him he could "sing his way out of the ghetto."<ref name=independent>{{cite news|last=  Parkes |first= Jack |title= Bobby Womack: The sad death of a soul survivor |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/bobby-womack-the-sad-death-of-a-soul-survivor-9570688.html |access-date=April 24, 2015|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=June 29, 2014}}</ref> Recalling his childhood, Bobby said, "we came up very poor.

Raised [[Baptist]], their mother played the organ for the church choir, and their father was a steelworker,<ref name="NYT obit" /> part-time minister, and musician who played the guitar and also sang gospel. Their father repeatedly ordered his sons to not touch his guitar while he was away, yet all five brothers regularly played it while their father was at work. One night, eight-year-old Bobby broke a guitar string, then tried to replace the string with a [[Shoelaces|shoelace]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw-p-m-Gxg4 | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211114/aw-p-m-Gxg4| archive-date=2021-11-14 | url-status=live|title=About 1:15–2:32 into the video|publisher=Youtube.com|access-date=2014-04-24}}{{cbignore}}</ref> After Friendly deduced that Bobby (who was missing a shoelace) had broken the string, he offered Bobby the chance to play the guitar for him in lieu of a whipping.

{{blockquote|Man, I played Andres Segovia, Elmore James and BB King. Even with one string short, I played classical music, soul, country and western, and rock'n'roll. I played my ass off.

Soon afterwards, Friendly bought guitars for all five of his sons. Because Bobby was left-handed, he flipped his guitar upside-down to play, not knowing that the guitar could have been restrung to accommodate a left-handed player.<ref>"I was left-handed and didn't realize I had the guitar upside-down." {{cite book |last= Womack|first= Bobby|title=Midnight Mover: The True Story of the Greatest Soul Singer in the World  |publisher= John Blake|page=Kindle Locations 235–236|isbn=1844541487|year= 2006}}</ref>

== Career ==
{{main|The Valentinos}}
By the mid-1950s,<ref name="cnn2" /> 10-year-old Bobby was touring with his brothers on the midwest gospel circuit as '''The Womack Brothers''',<ref name=latimes>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-bobby-womack-20140628-story.html |title=Bobby Womack dies at 70; soul singer and song writer |first=Todd |last=Martens |access-date=April 24, 2015|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=June 27, 2014}}</ref> along with Naomi on organ and Friendly Sr. on guitar. In 1954, under the moniker '''Curtis Womack and the Womack Brothers''', the group issued the Pennant single, "Buffalo Bill".<ref name="soulwalking1"/> More records followed.<ref name=latimes/>

[[Sam Cooke]], the lead singer of [[The Soul Stirrers]], first saw the group performing in the mid-1950s. He became their mentor and helped them go on tour. They went on national tours with [[The Staple Singers]].<ref name=RollingStone/> Even though Curtis often sang lead, Bobby was allowed to sing alongside him showcasing his gruff baritone vocals in contrast to his older brother's smoother tenor. During performances, Bobby would sometimes imitate the role of a preacher, which later became his nickname.<ref name="NYT obit" /> At just 16, Bobby dropped out of high school.<ref name=latimes/>

At the beginning of the 1960s, Cooke formed [[SAR Records]] and signed the quintet to the label in 1961, where they released a handful of gospel singles.<ref name="Guardian obit">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/28/bobby-womack-dies-aged-70|title=Bobby Womack obituary|last=Lewis|first=John|date=June 28, 2014|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=April 24, 2015}}</ref> Then, Cooke changed their name to '''[[the Valentinos]]''', relocated them to [[Los Angeles]] and convinced them to transition from gospel music to secular soul-and pop-influenced sound.<ref name=RollingStone/> Cooke produced and arranged the group's first hit single, "[[Lookin' for a Love]]", which was a pop version of the gospel song, "Couldn't Hear Nobody Pray", they had recorded earlier. The song became an R&B hit and helped land the group an opening spot for [[James Brown]]'s tour.<ref name=":8">{{cite book|last=Guralnick|first=Peter|url=https://archive.org/details/dreamboogietrium00gura|title=Dream Boogie: The Triumph of Sam Cooke|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|year=2005|isbn=0-316-37794-5|location=New York|pages=647–649|url-access=registration}}</ref> The group's next hit came in 1964 with the country-tinged "[[It's All Over Now]]", co-composed by Bobby. Their version was rising on the charts when [[The Rolling Stones]] covered it.{{sfn|Guralnick|2005|p=587}}

Womack was also a member of Cooke's band, touring and recording with him from 1961.<ref name="Guardian obit"/> The Valentinos' career was left shaky after Sam Cooke was shot and killed in a Los Angeles motel. Devastated by the news, the brothers disbanded and SAR Records folded. Womack attempted to start his solo career in 1965, first recording for Him Records and later the [[Chess Records]] subsidiary, [[Checker Records]]. Womack faced backlash after his marriage to Cooke's widow Barbara Cooke. He would go to radio stations and [[disc jockey]]s would throw away his records.<ref name=":9">{{Cite journal|date=May 17, 1979|title=Bobby Womack To Take Stepdaughter On Road To Teach Showmanship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YsADAAAAMBAJ&q=linda+bobby+womack+jet&pg=PA60|journal=Jet|pages=60}}</ref> He continued to work as a [[session musician]]. Between 1965 and 1968, he toured and recorded with [[Ray Charles]].<ref name="Guardian obit"/>

===1967–1972: Early solo career===
Circa 1965, Womack relocated to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] where he worked at [[Chips Moman]]'s American Studios. He played guitar on recordings by [[Joe Tex]] and the [[Box Tops]]. Womack played guitar on several of [[Aretha Franklin]]'s albums, including ''[[Lady Soul]]'', but not on the hit song "[[Chain of Fools]]", as erroneously reported. His work as a songwriter caught the eye of music executives after [[Wilson Pickett]] took a liking to some of Womack's songs and insisted on recording them. Among the songs were "I'm a Midnight Mover" and "[[I'm in Love (Bobby Womack song)|I'm in Love]]".<ref>{{cite web |last=Pickett|first=Wilson|title=Atlantic Recording Sessions: July 1 & 3, 1967 (Memphis, TN) |website=Jazz Disco | access-date=13 October 2021 |url=https://www.jazzdisco.org/atlantic-records/discography-1967/#670701}}</ref>

In 1968, Bobby signed with [[Minit Records]] and recorded his first solo album, ''[[Fly Me to the Moon (Bobby Womack album)|Fly Me to the Moon]]'', where he scored his first major hit with a cover of [[The Mamas & the Papas]]' "[[California Dreamin']]". In 1969, Womack forged a partnership with [[Gábor Szabó]] and with Szabó, penned the instrumental "[[Breezin' (song)|Breezin']]", later a hit for [[George Benson]]. Womack also worked with rock musicians [[Sly and the Family Stone]] and [[Janis Joplin]], contributing vocals and guitar work on the Family Stone's accomplished album ''[[There's a Riot Goin' On]]'', and penning the ballad "Trust Me", for Joplin on her album ''[[Pearl (Janis Joplin album)|Pearl]]''.  In fact, Womack was one of the last people to see Joplin alive, having visited her hours before she died at the Landmark Hotel in Los Angeles, California.

After two more albums with Minit, Bobby switched labels, signing with [[United Artists Records|United Artists]] where he changed his attire and his musical direction with the album ''[[Communication (Bobby Womack album)|Communication]]''. The album bolstered his first top 40 hit, "[[That's the Way I Feel About Cha]]", which peaked at number two R&B and number 27 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the spring of 1972.

===1972–1989: Solo success===
Following ''Communication'', Womack's profile was raised with two more albums, released in 1972. The first was ''[[Understanding (Bobby Womack album)|Understanding]]'', noted for the track "[[I Can Understand It]]", later covered by the funk band [[New Birth (band)|New Birth]] and a three-sibling lineup of Bobby's old group, the Valentinos, and two hit singles, "[[Woman's Gotta Have It (song)|Woman's Gotta Have It]]" and "[[Harry Hippie]]". The latter song was written for Womack by [[Jim Ford]] in a [[country music|country]] version, which Womack re-arranged in an R&B version. "Harry Hippie" later became Womack's first single to be certified [[Music recording sales certifications|gold]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

}}</ref> "Woman's Gotta Have It" became Womack's first single to hit number one on the R&B charts.

Another hit album released after ''Understanding'' was the soundtrack to the [[blaxploitation]] film ''[[Across 110th Street]]''. The [[Across 110th Street (song)|title track]] became popular during its initial 1972 release and later would be played during the opening and closing scenes of the 1997 film, ''[[Jackie Brown (film)|Jackie Brown]]''. In 1973, Womack released another hit album, ''[[Facts of Life (album)|Facts of Life]]'', and had a top 40 hit with "[[Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out]]," an older song Sam Cooke had done years before.

In 1974, Womack released his most successful single during this period with a remake of his first hit single, "[[Lookin' for a Love]]". His solo version of the song became even more successful than the original with the Valentinos, becoming his second number one hit on the R&B chart and peaking at number ten on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, becoming his only hit to reach that high on the pop chart. The song was featured on the album ''[[Lookin' for a Love Again]]'' and featured the minor charted "You're Welcome, Stop on By", later covered by [[Rufus (band)|Rufus & Chaka Khan]]. Womack's career began stalling after Womack received the news of his brother Harry's death. Womack continued to record albums with United Artists through 1975 and 1976 but with less success than previous albums. In 1975, Womack collaborated with [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] member [[Ronnie Wood]], on Wood's second solo album, ''[[Now Look]]''. In 1976, Womack organized a benefit at the [[Hollywood Palladium]] to raise funds for his friend, singer [[Jackie Wilson]], who had suffered a heart attack.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=March 4, 1976|title=Jackie Wilson Takes Few "Wobbly Steps"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bMADAAAAMBAJ&q=jackie+wilson+jet+1976+womack&pg=PA57|journal=Jet|pages=57}}</ref>

Womack languished with his own recordings during the late 1970s but continued to be a frequent collaborator with other artists, most notably [[Wilton Felder]] of [[The Crusaders (Houston group)|the Crusaders]]. After his son Truth Bobby died in 1978, Womack formed a production company named Truth. He hired a new co-producer and Keyboardist, [[Patrick Moten]] who worked with [[Ike Turner]] and [[Natalie Cole]], and released the album ''[[Roads of Life]]'' on [[Arista Records]] in 1979.<ref name=":10">{{Cite journal|date=January 4, 1979|title=Womack's Back On Recording Track With Sam Cooke's Daughter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZUIDAAAAMBAJ&q=linda+bobby+womack&pg=PA31|journal=Jet|pages=30–31}}</ref>

In 1980, Wilton Felder released the album ''Inherit The Wind'' on MCA Records which featured Womack.  He had a soulful song featuring on the [[Wilton Felder]] single "(No Matter How High I Get) I'll Still Be Looking Up to You". This song became a soul classic, notably in the UK—[[Robbie Vincent]] at Radio London included the track as one of his all-time winners in October 1982. In 1981, Womack signed with Beverly Glen Records and had his first R&B top 10 single in five years—since the 1976 single "[[Daylight (Bobby Womack song)|Daylight]]"—with "[[If You Think You're Lonely Now]]" that peaked at number three on the R&B singles chart. His accompanying album ''[[The Poet (album)|The Poet]]'' reached number one on the R&B album charts and is now seen as the high point of his long career, bringing him wider acclaim not only in the U.S. but also in Europe. He had two more R&B top 10 singles during the 1980s including the [[Patti LaBelle]] duet, "[[Love Has Finally Come at Last]]"(1984), and "[[I Wish He Didn't Trust Me So Much]]"(1985).<ref>[https://www.allmusic.com/song/i-wish-he-didnt-trust-me-so-much-mt0055556727 I wish he didn't trust me] retrieved 14 October 2021</ref> In 1986, Bobby recorded soul song "Living in a Box" with new group Living in a Box.

===1990–2014: Later career===
In 1993 Bobby Womack and Lulu released song "I'm Back for more". Womack's solo career started to slow down after 1994. In the mid-1990s, he released his twentieth studio album, ''[[Resurrection (Bobby Womack album)|Resurrection]]'' on his close friend's [[Ronnie Wood]]'s label. The album included session background work from admiring associates that included [[Rod Stewart]], [[Ronald Isley]], [[Keith Richards]] and [[Charlie Watts]]. His remaining brothers from [[the Valentinos]], Curtis, Friendly and [[Cecil Womack|Cecil]], featured as background singers. Two singles from the album—a duet with [[Ronald Isley]], "Tryin' Not To Break Down", and "Forever Love"—appeared on the Billboard R&B chart, but although the album contained two of Womack's best latter songs, "Cousin Henry" and "Don't Break Your Promise (Too Soon)", the album received a mixed critical reception.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/resurrection-mw0000118194 |title=Resurrection - Bobby Womack &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |website=AllMusic |access-date=2015-09-09}}</ref> Judges sitting in the high court in London in 2003 ruled that Bobby Womack stole the song “Cry Myself to Sleep” which appeared on the album from Liverpool musician and songwriter Mark Thomas, who never received the outstanding royalty payments due to him.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Echo|first=Liverpool|date=2005-10-24|title=How Bobby Womack ruined my life|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/how-bobby-womack-ruined-life-3526782|access-date=2021-07-25|website=Liverpool Echo|language=en}}</ref>

A gospel album, ''[[Back to My Roots (album)|Back to My Roots]]'', appeared at the end of the decade, but Womack largely concentrated on session and guest work for the next ten years.

In 1986, [[The Manhattans]] released the album ''Back To Basics'', which contained songs written and produced by Womack.<ref>

He is the featured vocalist on [[June Yamagishi]]'s ''My Pleasure'' album, on "Inherit The Wind", a track credited to [[Wilton Felder]], and with [[Allen Toussaint]] on "Sputin", and he contributed vocals to [[Rae & Christian]]'s version of "[[Wake Up Everybody (Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes song)|Wake Up Everybody]]". Other collaborations included "[[You Got What It Takes]]" with [[Diane Schuur]], "Ain't Nothing Like The Lovin' We Got" with [[Shirley Brown]], "Break the Chain" with [[Memphis Horns|Andrew Love & Wayne Jackson]] and "[[It's a Man's Man's Man's World]]" with [[Jeanie Tracy]].

In 1989, Womack sang on [[Todd Rundgren|Todd Rundgren's]] "For the Want of a Nail" on the album ''[[Nearly Human]]''. In 1998, he performed [[George Gershwin]]'s "[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]" with [[The Roots]] for the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s compilation album ''[[Red Hot + Rhapsody]]'', a tribute to Gershwin, which raised money for various charities devoted to increasing [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] awareness and fighting the disease.

In October 1992, Womack held four tribute concert for his friend [[Eddie Kendricks]].<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal|date=November 9, 1992|title=Friends, Fans Pay Tribute To Late Temptations Singer Eddie Kendricks At Concerts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vcIDAAAAMBAJ&q=eddie+kendricks+|journal=Jet|volume=83|issue=3|pages=60–61}}</ref> Womack planned the concert before Kendricks, who suffered from lung cancer, died on October 5, 1992.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=October 12, 1992|title=Bobby Womack To Headline Eddie Kendricks Tribute; Singer Suffer From Lung Cancer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vcEDAAAAMBAJ&q=bobby+womack|journal=Jet|volume=82|issue=25|pages=47}}</ref> Womack headlined the concert; other performers included [[Chaka Khan]], [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]], and [[Bill Withers]].<ref name=":7" />

In 2010, Womack contributed lyrics and sang on "[[Stylo (song)|Stylo]]" alongside [[Mos Def]], the first single from the third [[Gorillaz]] album ''[[Plastic Beach]]''. Womack was told to sing whatever was on his mind during the recording of "Stylo". "I was in there for an hour going crazy about love and politics, getting it off my chest," said Womack.<ref name="q2010">{{cite journal |first = Johnny |last = Davis |date=March 2010 |title = Yo Ho Ho |journal = [[Q (magazine)|Q]] |issue = 284 |pages = 44–52 |publisher = [[Bauer Media Group]] }}</ref> He also provided vocals on the song "Cloud of Unknowing" in addition to the song "Bobby in Phoenix" on their December 2010 release ''[[The Fall (Gorillaz album)|The Fall]]''.

==Musical legacy==
Throughout his long recording career, many of Womack's songs have been covered by other artists. In addition to the famous Rolling Stones' version of "[[It's All Over Now]]", it has charted also with versions by [[Patti Drew]] in 1966 and as a duet between Womack and [[Bill Withers]] in 1975. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s other artists regularly recorded his songs. They included [[Ella Washington]] and [[Baby Washington]], who recorded "I Can't Afford To Lose Him" in 1968, [[Jerry Butler]], who released "Yes My Goodness Yes" in 1968, [[Margie Joseph]], who issued "What You Gonna Do", and [[Roosevelt Grier]], who had an R&B success with "People Make The World". One of his most famous songs, "Trust Me", was recorded by [[Janis Joplin]] and later by Winfield Parker amongst others. Whilst his songs are famous, Bobby Womack is not one of the most famous soul singers. The 1960s and 1970s were especially profitable years for Womack's songwriting, either solo efforts or in partnership with the likes of Darryl Carter and [[Jim Ford]]. Whilst working as a session musician with [[Wilson Pickett]] he regularly contributed songs, including the original version of "[[I'm in Love (Bobby Womack song)|I'm In Love]]", later covered by [[Aretha Franklin]]. Another [[Atlantic Record]]s artist, [[Percy Sledge]], issued "Baby Help Me" in 1967. [[The J. Geils Band]] covered "[[Lookin' for a Love]]", released on several albums, including the live album ''[[Blow Your Face Out]]''.

In the following decade, [[Millie Jackson]] with "Put Something Down On It", [[Kokomo (band)|Kokomo]] and [[New Birth (band)|New Birth]] with "[[I Can Understand It]]", [[Ronnie Wood]] with "I Got A Feeling", and [[George Benson]] with the instrumental "[[Breezin' (song)|Breezin']]", recorded versions of Womack songs. [[Lou Donaldson]], the American jazz saxophonist, reinterpreted "You're Welcome To Stop On By" in 1974. The British singer [[Rod Stewart]] used the distinctive string arrangement from "Put Something Down On It" for his massive hit "[[Do Ya Think I'm Sexy]]". Other significant artists to record Bobby Womack songs include: [[Georgie Fame]] and [[Kelly Rowland]] and Vicki Sue Robinson, 1976 with "Daylight", [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[O V Wright]]'s separate covers of 
"That's The Way I Feel About You" and reggae acts [[Dennis Alcapone]], who issued a distinctive version of "Harry Hippy" entitled "Sorry Harry", and [[Triston Palma]], who issued "Love Has Finally Come At Last" in 1984.

[[Jodeci]]'s [[K-Ci Hailey]], a notable admirer of Womack's work, covered "If You Think You're Lonely Now" in 1994. Hailey again covered Womack in 2006 with his rendition of "A Woman's Gotta Have It". The song is referenced in [[Mariah Carey]]'s song "[[We Belong Together (Mariah Carey song)|We Belong Together]]", a number one hit in June 2005. Carey sings "I can't sleep at night / When you are on my mind / Bobby Womack's on the radio / Singing to me: 'If you think you're lonely now.'&nbsp;" In 2007, R&B singer [[Jaheim]] interpolated the song as "Lonely" on his album ''[[The Makings of a Man]]''. [[Neo soul]] singer [[Calvin Richardson]] also covered many of Womack's tunes. "[[That's the Way I Feel About Cha]]" was covered by the late R&B musician [[Gerald Levert]] and fellow singer [[Mary J. Blige]] on Levert's 1998 album ''[[Love & Consequences]]''.

Film director [[Quentin Tarantino]] used "[[Across 110th Street]]" (which, in a different version, had been the title song of [[Across 110th Street|the 1972 movie]]) in the opening and closing sequences of his 1997 film ''[[Jackie Brown (film)|Jackie Brown]]''. His work has been used in several other popular films, including ''[[Meet the Parents]]'' (2000), ''[[Ali (film)|Ali]]'' (2001) and ''[[American Gangster (film)|American Gangster]]'' (2007). A 2003 [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] commercial used Womack's interpretation of "California Dreamin." In 2005, "Across 110th Street" appeared in the hit [[Activision]] video game ''[[True Crime: New York City]]''.

On the 1994 release ''[[1-800-NEW-FUNK]]'', [[Nona Gaye]] covered "[[Woman's Gotta Have It]]", produced by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and backed by his band, [[New Power Generation]].

During the spring of 1997, R&B singer [[Rome (musician)|Rome]] covered the original song from his self-titled debut album.

In 2008, [[Kelly Rowland]] recorded her own version of his R&B hit "[[Daylight (Bobby Womack song)|Daylight]]" with [[Travis McCoy]] of the [[Gym Class Heroes]], which became a hit in the [[UK Singles Chart]], where it was previously released as a single by Womack in 1976.

In 2009, [[Calvin Richardson]] was chosen to record a [[tribute album]] to Womack to coincide with Womack's induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. The Grammy-nominated album was entitled ''[[Facts of Life: The Soul of Bobby Womack]]''. It reached No. 30 on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|US R&B chart]].<ref>{{cite web |url= {{BillboardURLbyName|artist=calvin richardson|chart=all}} |title=Facts of Life: The Soul of Bobby Womack – Calvin Richardson |work=billboard.com |access-date=September 27, 2011}}</ref>

==Personal life==

=== Marriages ===
On February 26, 1965, 77 days after [[Sam Cooke]]'s death, 20-year-old Womack and Cooke's widow Barbara Cooke, who was 10 years his senior, attempted to marry at the Los Angeles county courthouse.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=February 18, 1965|title=Sam Cooke's Widow To Wed Hubby's Guitarist-Pal This Month|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p8ADAAAAMBAJ&q=barbara+sam+cooke&pg=PA54|journal=Jet|pages=54–59}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|date=March 18, 1965|title=Sam Would Want It This Way⁠—Barbara Cooke: Widow of Slain Singer Marries Friend 77 Days After His Death|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iMADAAAAMBAJ&q=womack|journal=Jet|volume=27|issue=23|pages=46–49}}</ref><ref name="Guardian obit" /> Womack wore one of Cooke's suits to the courthouse and the media was present to record the event, but their application was rejected. According to the ''[[Los Angeles Sentinel]]'', it was denied because Womack was under 21 years old and did not have his parents' permission to marry. They were finally married on March 5, the day after his 21st birthday.<ref name=":8" /> Their marriage was considered a scandal by some in the music business and Womack found himself ostracized in the soul music world.<ref name="RollingStone" /><ref name="latimes" /> Womack's brothers turned against him, as did his audiences and disc jockeys.<ref name="Guardian obit" /><ref name=":9" /> Cooke's family was also enraged.

Womack fathered two sons, Cory and Jordan, from his relationship with Jody Laba.<ref name="Guardian obit" />

It turned out that the clothes actually belonged to Bobby's girlfriend.<ref name=":1" /> After his death, Bobby established the 'Harry James Womack Memorial Scholarship Fund' in his memory. The $50,000 scholarship fund was to aid minority students complete college, because Harry had always "wished he had gone on and gotten a degree."<ref>{{Cite journal|date=April 11, 1974|title=Womack Starts Scholarship Fund In Memory Of Brother|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VZADAAAAMBAJ&q=bobby+womack+scholarship&pg=PA72|journal=Jet|volume=46|issue=3|pages=72}}</ref>

===Drug addiction and health issues===
Womack opened up about his frequent [[drug abuse|drug use]] in his memoir, ''Midnight Mover''.<ref name="Midnight Mover">{{cite book |title=Bobby Womack – Midnight Mover |first1=Bobby |last1=Womack |first2=Robert |last2=Ashton |year=2006 |publisher=[[John Blake Publishing]] |isbn=978-1844541485 |url=http://www.johnblakepublishing.co.uk/e-store/Bobby-Womack-Midnight-Mover.html}}</ref> Womack said he began using [[cocaine]] sometime in the late 1960s. He had become close friends with Sly Stone, and was an enthusiastic participant in Stone's infamous drug binges.<ref name="telegraph">{{cite news|title= Bobby Womack - obituary |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/music-obituaries/10933899/Bobby-Womack-obituary.html |access-date=April 24, 2015|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group|The Telegraph]] |date=January 29, 2014}}</ref> Womack told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in 1984: "I was really off into the drugs. Blowing as much coke as I could blow. And drinking. And smoking weed and taking pills. Doing that all day, staying up seven, eight days. Me and Sly [Stone] were running partners."<ref name="RollingStone" />

In 1974, Womack experienced "temporary blindness" after he suffered a concussion from a blow to his head when he flipped off backwards over an amplifier.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=May 16, 1974|title=Bobby Womack Hospitalized For 'Temporary Blindness'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uY8DAAAAMBAJ&q=jet+bobby+womack&pg=PA60|journal=Jet|volume=46|issue=8|pages=60}}</ref>

His cocaine use turned into an addiction by the late 1970s. Womack partially attributed his drug addiction to his infant son Truth's death in 1978, which he said changed him forever. Throughout most of the 1980s, Womack struggled with a worsening addiction. During this period his career slowed down significantly, partly as a result of his drug usage.<ref name="latimes" /> In 1985, after completing 14 one-nighters, Womack was hospitalized after experiencing a blood circulation problem in his left leg.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=September 30, 1985|title=Celeb Sick Bay|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9LADAAAAMBAJ&q=bobby+womack|journal=Jet|volume=69|issue=3|pages=53}}</ref> Towards the end of the 1980s, he went into a rehabilitation center to get over his cocaine addiction,<ref name="RollingStone" /> which he said he conquered.

Womack survived [[prostate cancer]]. A series of health problems would follow, including diabetes, pneumonia, colon cancer and the early signs of Alzheimer's disease.

Womack developed [[diabetes]] in his later years. It was revealed in March 2012 that Womack was diagnosed with [[colon cancer]] after [[Bootsy Collins]] reported it on his Facebook page.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.clashmusic.com/news/bobby-womack-diagnosed-with-cancer|title=Bobby Womack Diagnosed With Cancer|last=Murray|first=Robin|date=March 26, 2012|website=Clash Magazine|language=en}}</ref> Womack announced afterwards that he was to undergo [[cancer surgery]]. On May 24, 2012, it was announced that Womack's surgery to remove a tumor from his colon was successful and he was declared cancer free. On January 1, 2013, Womack admitted that he struggled to remember his songs and other people's names, and later he was diagnosed with early stages of [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref name="theg_Bobb">{{Cite web
