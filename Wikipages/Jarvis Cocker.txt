'''Jarvis Branson Cocker''' (born 19 September 1963<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=glbZWVX7aN1keDa2%2BiYXnA&scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=4 April 2021|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}</ref>) is an English musician and radio presenter. As the founder, frontman, lyricist, and sole consistent member of the band [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]], he became a figurehead of the [[Britpop]] genre of the mid-1990s.<ref>{{Cite web|title=COMMON PEOPLE – THE STORY OF PULP|publisher=BBC|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/r2music/documentaries/pulp.shtml}}</ref> Following Pulp's hiatus, Cocker has pursued a solo career, and for seven years he presented the [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] show ''Jarvis Cocker's Sunday Service''.<ref name="sunday">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00ptsjd|title=Jarvis's Sunday Service|publisher=BBC|access-date=11 March 2012}}</ref>

==Early life==
Cocker was born in [[Sheffield]], growing up in the [[Richmond, Sheffield#Intake|Intake]] area of the city, and attending City School.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pulp's Jarvis Cocker goes back to his old Sheffield high school |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/pulp-76-1270456 |website=Nme.com |date=8 October 2011 |publisher=NME|access-date=19 April 2020}}</ref> His father, [[Mac Cocker]], a DJ and actor, left the family and moved to Sydney when Cocker was seven, and had no contact with Cocker or his sister, Saskia, until Jarvis was in his thirties. Following their father's departure, both children were brought up by their mother, Christine Connolly,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Letts |first1=Quentin |title=Jarvis was a wonderful mistake |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4714379/Jarvis-was-a-wonderful-mistake.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403032350/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4714379/Jarvis-was-a-wonderful-mistake.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 April 2015 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |access-date=3 February 2019|date=13 June 1998}}</ref> who later became a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] councillor.<ref name="independent">{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/jarvis-cocker-lone-star-429504.html|title=Jarvis Cocker: Lone star|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|location=UK|date=23 December 2006|access-date=10 March 2009}}</ref>

Cocker credits his upbringing, almost exclusively in female company, for his interest in how women think and what they have to say. He wrote a song ("A Little Soul" on ''[[This Is Hardcore]]'') about being abandoned by his father, working briefly as a butler,<ref name = "pitchfork">{{cite web|url=http://m.pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9548-jarvis-cocker/ |title=INTERVIEWS: Jarvis Cocker |work=Pitchfork|date=21 November 2014|access-date=10 January 2016}}</ref> and in 1998 travelled with his sister to Australia to meet him for the first time in nearly 30 years.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jarvis Cocker Reunited With Father |url=https://www.gigwise.com/news/32611/ |website=Gigwise.com|access-date=19 April 2020}}</ref>

==Career==

===Pulp===
{{Main|Pulp (band)}}
Cocker founded the band Pulp originally under the name Arabacus Pulp (named after a tradable commodity he learned about in an economics class) at the age of 15<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/film-and-tv/pulp-frontman-jarvis-cocker-reveals-873647 |title=Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker reveals jealousy over Morrissey and the Smiths |newspaper=[[Manchester Evening News]] |access-date=5 June 2016|date=19 October 2011 }}</ref> while he was a pupil at [[Outwood Academy City|The City School, Sheffield]]. After numerous line-up changes, and shortening the name to "Pulp", the band eventually found fame in the 1990s with the success of the albums ''[[His 'n' Hers]]'' (1994) and ''[[Different Class]]'' (1995). Cocker was Pulp's frontman, and part of his trademark image was his glasses, which seemed to "stay magically on his face" no matter what antics he performed. This feat was achieved using "a huge rubber band round the back" of his glasses.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{Cite news|title=In Search of the Holy Whale|publisher=BBC Radio 4FM|date=22 January 2011}}</ref>

Pulp released two more albums (''[[This Is Hardcore]]'' and ''[[We Love Life]]'') to critical acclaim, though neither achieved the commercial success of ''Different Class''. After releasing a greatest hits album, the band went on hiatus from 2003 to 2010, then returned to activity in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pulp return to Glastonbury after 13 years|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a326846/pulp-return-to-glastonbury-after-13-years.html|access-date=13 April 2015|date=25 June 2011}}</ref>

Cocker is also renowned for his wit and observations of the cultural scene. He was a frequent guest on TV shows in the 1990s, and hosted an art series for [[Channel 4]] – "Journeys into the Outside". In the series, he took a trip across the globe, meeting so-called "outsider artists", people who create wacky and wonderful works of art, trying to understand what compelled them to do so. Cocker's penchant for TV appearances was reflected in a parody of "[[Common People (song)|Common People]]" ("Showbiz People") which was featured on the satirical comedy show ''[[Spitting Image]]'' in 1996.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

====Brit Awards incident====
{{see also|Brit Awards#Michael Jackson and Jarvis Cocker (1996)}}
Cocker invaded the stage at the 1996 [[Brit Awards]] in a spur-of-the-moment protest against [[Michael Jackson]]'s performance. Jackson was performing his hit "[[Earth Song]]" while surrounded by children and a [[rabbi]]. Cocker and his friend [[Peter Mansell]] (a former Pulp member) performed an impromptu stage invasion in protest.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/pop-and-the-art-of-bad-behaviour-1320055.html "Pop and the art of bad behaviour"]. The Independent. Retrieved 4 February 2015</ref>

Cocker was detained and interviewed by the police on suspicion of assault. He was accompanied by comedian [[Bob Mortimer]], a former [[solicitor]], who represented him in that capacity.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2008/02/20/could-jarvis-cocker-flashing-hit-brit-awards-again-1305/ |title=Could Jarvis Cocker flashing hit Brit Awards again? |work=Metro|location=UK |date=20 February 2008 |access-date=14 September 2013}}</ref> He was subsequently released without charge. Opinions from the press on Cocker's actions were mixed. ''[[Melody Maker]]'''s edition of 2 March 1996, for example, suggested Cocker should be [[knighthood|knighted]], and [[Noel Gallagher]] of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] said that "Jarvis Cocker is a star" and should be awarded an [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]]. [[Blur (band) | Blur]] frontman [[Damon Albarn]] did not approve of Cocker's actions, stating that he found it "really disturbing" when Cocker "pulled his pants down" in front of Jackson. "He's got some very odd ideas about reality", Albarn added on Cocker's actions, "I think it’s a collective responsibility to say ‘No you can’t go and do what you’re doing’, not just to ridicule him".<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-good-the-bad-and-the-queen-10-1351623 | title=Damon Albarn lays into Jarvis Cocker|website=Nme.com| date=5 January 2007}}</ref> Though the media described Cocker's stunt as "[[mooning]] Jackson", Cocker denied it, saying that he merely turned his bottom waving.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCI6zmVOf14&feature=fvw |title=Jarvis Cocker reaction to Michael Jackson death (Question Time) | publisher=[[YouTube]] |access-date=16 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151216130428/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCI6zmVOf14&feature=fvw |archive-date=16 December 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EA1nXLv2yg|title=Stephen Merchant interviews Jarvis Cocker|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00tq1vw |title = BBC Radio 4 - Chain Reaction, Series 6, Stephen Merchant interviews Jarvis Cocker|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Jackson himself stated on the incident, ″I'm sickened, saddened, shocked, upset, cheated and angry, but immensely proud that the cast remained professional and the show went on″.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/brits-brawl-as-cocker-pulps-jackson-chorus-1320077.html | title=Brits brawl as Cocker 'pulps' Jackson chorus| date=21 February 1996}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/entertainment/2000/brit_awards/665776.stm |title = BBC NEWS &#124; in Depth &#124; Brit Awards &#124; Brits behaving badly}}</ref> Regarding his actions, Cocker said, "My actions were a form of protest at the way Michael Jackson sees himself as some kind of Christ-like figure with the power of healing. I just ran on the stage. I didn't make any contact with anyone as far as I recall."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlp.cz/space/opatrilp/Pulp/the_Brits_96.html |title=Jarvis' stage invasion at the 1996 Brits |publisher=Mlp.cz |access-date=10 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221215457/http://www.mlp.cz/space/opatrilp/Pulp/the_Brits_96.html |archive-date=21 February 2009 }}</ref> 

On 2 July 2009, soon after Jackson's death, Cocker appeared as a panellist on [[BBC]] TV's ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]''. He said that Jackson's death had been over-hyped by the media, adding that, ″If there's a tragedy about the whole thing, I would say [...] if he had kept making great records like he did in the mid-80s up to now that would have been great but for some reason for the last 20 years he didn't do that″. When asked what he objected to about Michael Jackson at the time of the Brit Awards incident, he reiterated his earlier comments about Jackson and Christ. When asked, "Otherwise as a performer you thought he was a genius?" Cocker replied, "Yeah, he invented the [[Moonwalk (dance)|moonwalk]]."<ref name="auto"/>

''Room 29''  is a concept album about Hollywood's once famous hotel the [[Chateau Marmont]]. Cocker stayed in room 29 at the hotel during a Pulp tour in 2012.

Around 2008, Cocker also participated in a project that tackled the question, "What is Music?", designed to enter into the debate over the future of the music industry. Cocker asked: "Does this mean that music can now go back to being an art form again? Also, what happens if you get a band to rehearse in an art gallery instead of a rehearsal space?"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jarviscocker.net/news/jarvis-cocker-is-making-an-exhibition-of-himself |title=Jarvis Cocker.net |publisher=Jarvis Cocker.net |access-date=13 April 2011}}</ref> Consequently, Cocker and his band installed themselves in an art gallery in Paris, France for five days. Each day, Cocker and his musicians performed a variety of different tasks. These included sound-tracking a relaxation class, inviting local musicians to join them in a jam and arranging activities with local school-children. Films of the exhibition remain accessible online in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/1468368 |title=Ustream.Tv |publisher=Ustream.Tv |date=5 May 2009 |access-date=13 April 2011}}</ref>

In October 2009, BBC Radio 6 Music announced Cocker was set to take over the Sunday afternoon slot from 10 January 2010 onwards, with ''Jarvis Cocker's Sunday Service''. He was quoted as saying "Sunday doesn't feel that different to the other days of the week any more. Although there was something weird about when everything seemed to stop on a Sunday, it kind of marked out the week. I am going to put the boringness back into Sunday. That's my mission."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/news/20091022_jarvis_cocker.shtml|title=Cocker for 6: Jarvis Cocker to present Sunday afternoon show from January|last=Barnes|first=Ruth|publisher=BBC 6 Music|date=22 October 2009|access-date=30 May 2010}}</ref>

As of January 2019, 24 episodes of the programme have been broadcast. The first episode of the series, "Overnight Delivery", won the 2012 Prix Italia prize for 'extraordinary originality and / or innovation in a radio documentary'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ifc2.wordpress.com/2012/09/21/winners-radiodoc-prix-italia-2012/|title=PI 2012 – Winners radiodoc Prix Italia +AUDIO|first=Willem|last=Davids|website=Ifc2.wordpress.com|date=21 September 2012}}</ref>

Cocker explained in December 2013:

{{cquote|Crop Rotation has long been recognized as a way of preserving the fertility of the soil. Every now and again a field has to be left fallow for a year in order to make sure it has time to recover. In 2014 I will be that field.

In December 2017, Cocker presented his last ''Sunday Service'' programme for the BBC. Announcing the news, he said: "It's not goodbye, it’s just farewell. We wanted to say farewell properly and so we’re going to do a run of five extra-special shows throughout December, starting this Sunday.

===Acting===
He appears in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]], (2005)'' as Myron Wagtail, lead singer of the Weird Sisters. His original scene was cut short, but most of the Blu-ray and DVD releases hold the original scene in full-length with the whole 3:30-minute song in bonus features. He also played himself in the 2007 romantic comedy, ''[[The Good Night]]''. American director [[Wes Anderson]] is an admirer of Cocker's work.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://thisrecording.com/today/tag/wes-anderson |title=Home – This Recording|website=Thisrecording.com |access-date=1 October 2009}}</ref> This led to Anderson giving Cocker a role in the 2009 stop-animation movie ''[[Fantastic Mr. Fox (film)|Fantastic Mr. Fox]]'' as the voice of Petey, who sings an original song, and whose appearance is based on Cocker himself.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0432283/ |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|title=Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) |access-date=1 October 2009}}</ref> He also voices a French pop singer in Anderson's 2021 film [[The French Dispatch]].

===Journalism===
In June 2011, Cocker was chosen as poetry guest editor for [[The Mays]] Anthology, a collection of new writing from students at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://themaysxix.tumblr.com/post/5744413958/poetry-jarvis-cocker-is-a-musician-actor-radio |title=The Mays XIX – POETRY.

In 2014, he was the Editor-at-Large for Faber and Faber, and ''Singing from the Floor'' by JP Bean is his first acquisition. Cocker explained to ''NME'': "Singing from the Floor portrays an important movement in vernacular culture in the voices of the people who made it happen – and that's not an easy task ... JP Bean has captured this moment before it is lost forever, and has made it live again on the page. He's a very clever chap. Let's raise a glass to him."<ref name="Bean" /> Cocker says he writes about 'the little things that stick in your mind' because most of them are 'eternal'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcs.cam.ac.uk/interviews/0013976-interview-jarvis-cocker.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606204808/http://www.tcs.cam.ac.uk/interviews/0013976-interview-jarvis-cocker.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 June 2014 |title=Interview: Jarvis Cocker &#124; The Cambridge Student |publisher=University of Cambridge |date=23 February 2012 |access-date=12 August 2014 }}</ref>

==Personal life==
Soon after signing to Fire, in November 1985, Cocker fell out of a window while trying to impress a girl with a [[Spider-Man]] impression and ended up in hospital, temporarily requiring the use of a wheelchair, in which he appeared during concerts.<ref>Sturdy, p.124</ref>

In 1988, at age 25, Cocker took a sabbatical from Pulp to study Fine Art and Film at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]], where he was tutored by [[Vera Neubauer]] and [[Malcolm Le Grice]]. He graduated in 1991.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32628750 |title=She came from Greece - but is this the woman from Common People? |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=7 May 2015 |website=BBC |access-date=8 October 2019 }}</ref><ref name="observer">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jun/10/popandrock.meltdownfestival2007 |title=Paris match &#124; guardian.co.uk Music |newspaper=The Observer |date=10 June 2007 |access-date=29 June 2009 | location=London | first=Lynn | last=Barber}}</ref>

In the late 1990s, Cocker dated [[Chloë Sevigny]]. She later said in a 2009 interview:

{{cquote|When I was in my early 20s, I went out with a British pop star, Jarvis Cocker; of course, pop stars have much more celebrity, I think, than actors even. They're really hunted by their fans much more. I remember driving around these remote towns in Wales and kids running after us in the street. I was like, 'This is horrible!' And I saw the effect it had on him, and that's when I decided I never wanted to be a celebrity at that level, and I think that's why I've chosen to do the work that I do and just kind of work with directors that I love and try and do work that means something to me.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zimbio.com/Chloe+Sevigny/articles/127/7+Questions+with+Chloe+Sevigny|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127193805/http://www.zimbio.com/Chloe%2BSevigny/articles/127/7%2BQuestions%2Bwith%2BChloe%2BSevigny|url-status=dead|title=Zimbio.com|archive-date=27 November 2012}}</ref>}}
