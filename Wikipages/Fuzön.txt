'''Fuzön''' ({{Lang-ur|فیوزن}} – literal English pronunciation: "fusion") is a [[Pop music|pop rock]] band from [[Karachi]], [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]] formed in 2001. The name was derived from ''[[Fusion (music)|fusion]]'', as the former lead vocalist of the band, [[Shafqat Amanat Ali]] describes the band as a fusion of urdu classical music and modern soft [[rock music]] blended with the [[Sufi]] Style of singing.

Fuzön encompasses hybrid styles of pop and rock instrumentation. "Fuzon was one of the innovative bands of the new millennium, as they gave us a timeless album like ''Saagar''.<ref name=Tribune>[https://tribune.com.pk/story/285619/fuzon-a-decade-of-soul-music/ Fuzon: A decade of soul music], The Express Tribune newspaper, Published 31 October 2011, Retrieved 13 April 2017</ref>

==History==
[[Shallum Asher Xavier]] and Imran Momina were the founding members, who decided to put their heads together as they realised the similarities between their musical ideas and tastes.

Meanwhile, [[Shafqat Amanat Ali]], who had been singing for a few years, had happened to drop into Immo's recording studio for an assignment. Shafqat's vocals so impressed the duo, that he was signed up with Shallum and Immu to form the band "Fuzön". "The year 2011 marks the 10th anniversary of the three-member band that has made a significant contribution to Pakistani music."<ref name=Tribune/>

Shafqat had to leave the band to concentrate more on his solo projects.<ref name=Tribune/> He was replaced by Rameez Mukhtar, the main vocalist in 2011.<ref name=Tribune/>

''Saagar'' (Virgin Records; CD; Rs. 199, Cassette; Rs. 65) features 12 tracks, with a common strain of pop melodies blended with Pakistani classical and folk vocals.
