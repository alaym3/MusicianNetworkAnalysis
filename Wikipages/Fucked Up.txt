'''Fucked Up''' is a Canadian [[hardcore punk]] band from [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], formed in 2001.<ref name=sanneh>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/12/arts/music/12musi.html?_r=2&oref=login&oref=slogin|title=Music Review: ****** **. Outrage, Bile, Hardcore Punk ... and a Sensible Lost-and-Found|first=Kelefa|last=Sanneh|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2007-11-12}}</ref> The band consists of [[Damian Abraham]] (vocals), Mike Haliechuk (guitar, vocals), Josh Zucker (guitar), Sandy Miranda (bass) and Jonah Falco (drums, vocals).

To date, the band has released five studio albums, alongside several EPs, singles, and companion releases. The band won the [[2009 Polaris Music Prize]] for their second studio album, ''[[The Chemistry of Common Life]]''.

== History ==
=== 2001–2007 ===
The band formed and played their first shows in early 2001. The initial practicing lineup consisted of 10,000 Marbles (Mike Haliechuk, lead guitar), Concentration Camp (Josh Zucker, rhythm guitar, vocals), Mustard Gas (Sandy Miranda, bass guitar) and Chris Colohan (of Left For Dead/The Swarm fame, who was lead vocalist for [[Cursed (band)|Cursed]]). Just prior to recording their demo tape, Concentration Camp concentrated on guitar duties and vocal duties were taken over from Colohan by Pink Eyes (Damian Abraham, also known as Mr. Damian). Drums were played by Mr. Jo (Jonah Falco, also credited as G. Beat or J. Falco).

Following the release of the demo, the band embarked on a long series of [[7-inch]] records. The band released the ''"[[They shall not pass|No Pasaran]]"'' 7-inch in May 2002. The ''Police'' 7-inch was released on March 2003,<ref>[https://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/article/a-completely-biased-ranking-of-the-60-best-canadian-indie-rock-songs-of-the-00s-part-ii "A Completely Biased Ranking of the 60 Best Canadian Indie Rock Songs of the 00s Part II"]. ''Vice'', Cam Lindsay Apr 10 2017</ref> quickly followed the ''Baiting the Public'' 7-inch in May 2003. Two more 7-inches followed in 2004, the single ''Dance of Death'', and the 4-song EP ''Litany''. The vinyl releases to this point were collected on 2004s ''Epics in Minutes'' CD. The band was the subject of a two-minute 16&nbsp;mm film showing its links to the Toronto hardcore scene, a local infoshop and punk radio show.

The band's use of imagery and symbolism (notable the use of [[Sigil (magic)|Sigils]]) took a decided turn after the release of Epics in Minutes, as it was followed by two limited 12-inches, the ''Looking for Gold'' 12-inch, and the live ''Let Likes be Cured by Likes'' 12-inch. The ''Looking for Gold'' 12-inch contained no liner notes or credits, no song titles, and a hidden track. It was self-released by the band in 2004 in two limited runs of 300 and 400 copies. The title track was 16 minutes long, used 18 guitar tracks, had a three-minute [[drum solo]] and contained 5 minutes of [[whistling]].

In the summer of 2004, the band released the ''Generation'' 7-inch and 12-inch EPs. After [[Concert tour|tour]]ing for most of 2005 the band took on David Eliade as a quasi-full-time manager/promoter. In early 2006 Eliade began shopping demos of songs from the planned ''[[Hidden World (album)|Hidden World]]'' album to labels, ending with the band signing to [[Jade Tree Records]] for an early fall 2006 release of the album. Jade Tree is distributed by Touch & Go which in turn has a distribution agreement with ADA (Warner Music Group). Jade Tree licensed the vinyl version to [[Deranged Records]], which released it as a double album in November 2006.

Several other records, such as ''Year of the Dog'' 12-inch were released, before the band went on the European tour, visiting England, Germany, and Spain, among other places. January 16, 2007, marked the band's live television debut on ''[[MTV Live (Canadian TV series)|MTV Live]]'', where they were introduced as "Effed Up".<ref name="exclaimmag">{{cite web|last=Sutherland|first=Sam|title=What the Fuck?

This performance sparked controversy and resulted in MTV Canada banning moshing from future ''MTV Live'' performances.<ref>[http://vice.typepad.com/vice_magazine/2007/01/fucked_up_banne.html Vice magazine: Fucked Up Banned From MTV<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312010727/http://vice.typepad.com/vice_magazine/2007/01/fucked_up_banne.html |date=March 12, 2007 }}</ref> In November 2007, the band played a show in New York that was filmed for the movie ''Burn'', directed by Richard Roepnack.  The performance was positively reviewed in the ''[[New York Times]]'', although the Times chose not to print the band's name, referring to them instead as a string of asterisks.<ref name=sanneh /><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2193872/|title=****** **: Why do bands give themselves unprintable names?|first=Hua|last=Hsu|magazine=Slate|date=2008-06-23}}</ref>

===2008–present===
[[File:Damian Abraham.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Abraham at an April 2010 literacy event]]
On October 9, 2008, the band returned to [[MTV Live (Canada)|MTV Live]], this time performing in the men's washroom. Once again, the band (and their fans) caused a large amount of damage, destroying the ceiling, spray painting walls and knocking over amps and a motorcycle which was brought into the washroom as a prop. Fans, who were told beforehand to stay out of the washroom and to watch from outside the door, rushed the doors and joined in the destruction the band had already started. The band was supposed to play three songs but were stopped after the first song as MTV was not aware of the destruction the band had planned and were concerned about the safety of the band, audience and crew.
On October 10 Abraham blogged about the performance on the MTV Live website, saying the bathroom performance was "f**king out of control terrifying."<!-- yes, the original source says "f**cking" instead of "fucking", so please don't change it to "fucking"--><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110928183226/http://www.mtv.ca/news/article.jhtml?id=11383 F**ked Up Explains Bathroom Performance], by Sharlene Chiu, at MTV.ca (via [[archive.org]]); published October 10, 2008; retrieved September 23, 2014</ref>

The band signed to [[Matador Records]] in Spring of 2008. That summer, Matador reissued the "Year Of The Pig" 12-inch single. This time it came out with additional formats including a series of three 7-inches, for the US, UK and Japan respectively, each with a different edit of the A-side and a new B-side. A CDEP compiled all the versions from the various vinyl versions. The band toured extensively in the UK behind this release, following it with a trip up the West Coast.

On October 7, 2008, Matador released Fucked Up's second album, [[The Chemistry of Common Life|''The Chemistry Of Common Life'']]. The album received near-universal critical acclaim from publications such as the NME, The New York Times, Blender, Pitchfork, Alternative Press, Q Magazine,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/fuckedup/chemistryofcommonlife |title=Chemistry Of Common Life Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More at Metacritic |publisher=Metacritic.com |access-date=2011-12-04}}</ref> and would later go on to win the [[2009 Polaris Music Prize]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=2009 Nominees|url=https://polarismusicprize.ca/2009-nominees/|access-date=2021-02-24|website=Polaris Music Prize|language=en}}</ref> The band toured the Eastern US in October, including a much-covered 12-hour long show on the Bowery in New York on October 14. They were joined by musical guests including Ezra Koenig of [[Vampire Weekend]], [[Moby]], John Joseph of the [[Cro-Mags]], members of [[Endless Boogie (band)|Endless Boogie]], [[Les Savy Fav]], [[Dinosaur Jr.]], and others.

In November 2008, the band participated with other similarly named bands, including [[Holy Fuck (band)|Holy Fuck]], [[Fuck (band)|Fuck]], and [[Fuck Buttons]] in the ''Festival of the Fuck Bands'' [[music festival]] in the village of [[Fugging, Upper Austria|Fucking]], Austria.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2009-01-29/music/fucked-up-and-other-f-word-bands-congregate-at-the-festival-of-the-fuck-bands/ |title=Fucked Up and other F-Word Bands Congregate at the Festival of the Fuck Bands |last=Lopez |first=Michael |date=27 January 2009 |newspaper=[[Phoenix New Times]]|access-date=2009-10-25}}</ref> In 2009 Fucked Up took part in an interactive documentary series called [[City Sonic]].  The series, which featured 20 Toronto artists, had lead singer Damian Abraham inside Rotate This talking about his love of vinyl and punk music.<ref>{{cite web|title=Watch Damian Abraham (Fucked Up) at Rotate This Video &#124; City Sonic Films &#124; Toronto Music Mobile Video|url=http://www.citysonic.tv/films/Damian-Abraham-Fucked-Up-at-Rotate-This.php|access-date=2011-12-04|publisher=Citysonic.tv}}</ref>

Fucked Up played the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|ATP New York 2010]] music festival in Monticello, New York in September 2010 as well as an annual Halloween gig in Toronto. In February 2011, the band toured [[Australia]] for the first time, as a part of the [[Soundwave (Australian music festival)|Soundwave Festival]], along with side-shows from the festival with artists as diverse as [[The Bronx (band)|the Bronx]], [[Terror (band)|Terror]], [[H2O (American band)|H<sub>2</sub>O]], Trash Talk and [[Polar Bear Club]].

The band's third studio album, ''[[David Comes to Life]],'' was released in June 2011. A self-professed "rock opera" set in [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcherite Britain]], it tells a story of love, loss and redemption, with the story complicated by misdirection and unreliable narrators.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://frontpsych.com/2011/06/27/a-brief-history-of-punk-ambition-part-1/ |title=A Brief History of Punk Ambition: Part 1 « Frontier Psychiatrist |publisher=Frontpsych.com |access-date=2011-12-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205020932/http://frontpsych.com/2011/06/27/a-brief-history-of-punk-ambition-part-1/ |archive-date=2011-12-05 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Breihan |first=Tom |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/41266-fucked-ups-damian-abraham-talks-about-becoming-a-vj-and-making-a-rock-opera/ |title=Fucked Up's Damian Abraham Talks About Becoming a VJ and Making a Rock Opera &#124; News |website=Pitchfork |date=2011-01-19 |access-date=2011-12-04}}</ref> The record debuted at No. 83 on the Billboard 200 in the US<ref name="Billboard.com 1">{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=fucked up|chart=Billboard 200}} |title=Music Albums, Top 200 Albums & Music Album Charts |magazine=Billboard.com |access-date=2011-12-04}}</ref> and received wide critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fitzmaurice |first=Larry |url=http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15513-david-comes-to-life/ |title=Fucked Up: David Comes to Life &#124; Album Reviews |website=Pitchfork |date=2011-06-08 |access-date=2011-12-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Raftery |first=Brian |url=http://www.spin.com/reviews/fucked-david-comes-life-matador |title=Fucked Up, 'David Comes to Life' (Matador) |publisher=SPIN.com |date=2011-06-07 |access-date=2011-12-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Gotrich |first=Lars |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/06/14/136620001/first-listen-f-up-david-comes-to-life |title=First Listen: F- Up, 'David Comes To Life' |publisher=NPR |date=2011-05-30 |access-date=2011-12-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/david-comes-to-life |title=David Comes To Life Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More at Metacritic |publisher=Metacritic.com |access-date=2011-12-04}}</ref> [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] magazine named ''David Comes to Life'' its No.&nbsp;1 Album of 2011, and put the band on the cover, writing "Fucked Up have synthesized 40 years of rock into what's ostensibly a hardcore record, and in doing so created its own logic."<ref name="spintopalbums">Spin Staff.

==Lawsuit==
In January 2008, Fucked Up, along with [[Xiu Xiu]], filed a lawsuit against ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and [[Camel Cigarettes]] for an advertisement that included both bands in an ''Indie Rock Universe'' special.<ref name="The Daily Swarm">{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailyswarm.com/swarm/indie-rock-universe-fucked-and-xiu-xiu-file-class-action-lawsuit-against-camel-and-rolling-stone/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219020221/http://www.thedailyswarm.com/swarm/indie-rock-universe-fucked-and-xiu-xiu-file-class-action-lawsuit-against-camel-and-rolling-stone/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-12-19 |title=The Indie Rock Universe Strikes Back: Fucked Up and Xiu Xiu file class action lawsuit against Camel and Rolling Stone |publisher=The Daily Swarm |date=2007-12-17 |access-date=2014-02-11 }}</ref> The advertisement apparently portrayed the bands as supporters of [[Camel Cigarettes|Camel]]. Pink Eyes stated that "The fact that ''Fucked Up'' was mentioned in there wasn't some great coincidence. This isn't a case of subliminal advertising, where we're claiming that there were penises in the shadows — our name is right there. Maybe they thought we were too stupid to know what was going on."<ref name="The Daily Swarm"/>

On January 28, 2010, The Court of Appeal of the State of California for the First Appellate District reversed the lower court's ruling, saying constitutional principles of freedom of speech and the press require that the lawsuit be dismissed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/A122452.PDF |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-01-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100518032332/http%3A//www%2Ecourtinfo%2Eca%2Egov/opinions/documents/A122452%2EPDF |archive-date=2010-05-18 }}  at the [[Library of Congress]] (May 18, 2010).</ref>
