'''Travis Miller''' (born May 13, 1984) is an American musician from [[Richmond, Virginia]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Pearce|first=Sheldon|title=Zones: Richmond's Emerging Hip-Hop Scene, According to Nickelus F|url=https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/zones-richmonds-emerging-hip-hop-scene-according-to-nickelus-f/|access-date=2021-06-20|website=Pitchfork|date=9 August 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> He has recorded under multiple aliases in various genres since his first known released project in 2005,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Majesty of Disease Side A, by SEIDHR|url=https://liluglymane.bandcamp.com/track/majesty-of-disease-side-a|access-date=2021-06-20|website=LIL UGLY MANE}}</ref> including '''Lil Ugly Mane''', '''Shawn Kemp''', '''Vudmurk''' and '''Bedwetter'''.

Miller rose to popularity in the early 2010s with an [[experimental music|experimental]] approach to [[Southern hip hop]]. His debut album ''[[Mista Thug Isolation]]'' gained him notoriety in the [[underground hip hop]] scene.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Why Did One Of The Internet's Most Creative Rappers Quit?|url=https://www.thefader.com/2015/05/01/lil-ugly-manes-long-retirement-from-rap|access-date=2021-06-20|website=The FADER|language=en}}</ref> Since then, he has experimented with a number of styles within and outside the hip hop genre, most recently releasing the [[indie rock]] album ''[[Volcanic Bird Enemy and the Voiced Concern]]''.<ref>https://www.michigandaily.com/music/from-internet-rap-to-eclectic-pop-lil-ugly-mane-returns-with-two-new-singles/</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Lil Ugly Mane turns his brush to college rock and makes the water murky on "PORCELAIN SLIGHLTY/INTO A LIFE"|url=https://earmilk.com/2021/09/22/lil-ugly-mane-turns-his-brush-to-college-rock-and-makes-the-water-murky-on-porcelain-slighlty-into-a-life/|website=Earmilk|date=22 September 2021|access-date=2021-09-23}}</ref> His other work spans genres including [[Instrumental hip hop|instrumental]] and [[abstract hip hop]], [[black metal]] and [[noise music]].

==Musical career==
Miller began recording music in the 2000s under a number of aliases. Much of his early music cannot be found today on the internet, however some of it has been re-released, such as on his ''Register'' compilation album. Some of his early work included the [[black metal]] projects Vudmurk and Seidhr, the [[Industrial music|industrial]] and [[Noise music|noise]] projects Across, Public Garden and Rats, and the [[underground hip hop]] group The Legacy, during which time he rapped under the name Young Gus.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://liluglymane.bandcamp.com/album/register |website=Bandcamp |title=various - register |date= 3 February 2017 |accessdate=20 October 2021}}</ref>

Miller began releasing hip hop under the name Lil Ugly Mane on [[Bandcamp]] and producing beats for himself and other artists under the name Shawn Kemp in 2010, releasing his debut mixtape ''Playaz Circle'' in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://liluglymane.bandcamp.com/album/playaz-circle-pre-meditation-the-first-prophecy-preview-mixtape-real-murder-posse-underground-version |website=Bandcamp |title=LIL UGLY MANE - PLAYAZ CIRCLE:PRE MEDITATION(THE FIRST PROPHECY)PREVIEW MIXTAPE (REAL MURDER POSSE UNDERGROUND VERSION) |date=1 February 2011 |accessdate=20 October 2021}}</ref> His early work under the Lil Ugly Mane name drew on various styles of underground [[Southern hip hop]] from the 1990s such as [[Memphis rap]] and [[chopped and screwed]]. His style was similar to that of the contemporaneous [[Raider Klan]] collective, with whom he collaborated. His 2012 debut album ''[[Mista Thug Isolation]]'' earned positive reviews from [[Mishka NYC]], among others and support from members of the popular hip hop collective [[Odd Future]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mishkanyc.com/bloglin/2012/03/05/review-lil-ugly-mane-mista-thug-isolation|title=Review: Lil Ugly Mane - Mista Thug Isolation|work=Mishka NYC|accessdate=1 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806113130/https://mishkanyc.com/bloglin/2012/03/05/review-lil-ugly-mane-mista-thug-isolation|archive-date=6 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hypetrak.com/2012/10/earl-sweatshirt-names-his-five-favorite-songs/|title=Earl Sweatshirt Names His Five Favorite Songs|work=Hypetrak|accessdate=11 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819172015/http://hypetrak.com/2012/10/earl-sweatshirt-names-his-five-favorite-songs/|archive-date=19 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The album has since been hailed as a classic of the 2010s underground hip hop scene, earning later praise from [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] and [[The Needle Drop]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23067-mista-thug-isolation/ |last=O'Connor |first=Andy |title=Lil Ugly Mane - Mista Thug Isolation |website=Pitchfork |date=12 April 2017 |accessdate=20 October 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSEfSwPsMNE |last=theneedledrop |title=15 Albums I Wish I Reviewed |website=YouTube |date=2 August 2018 |accessdate=20 October 2021}}</ref> The album was followed by a number of smaller releases, including the ''Uneven Compromise'' EP, which is ranked in the top 10 greatest EPs of all time by user-generated music review site [[RateYourMusic]], and the single "On Doing an Evil Deed Blues", in which he outlined his grievances with the music industry and his intention to retire the Lil Ugly Mane project.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://rateyourmusic.com/charts/top/ep/all-time |title=Custom chart: top EPs of all-time |website=RateYourMusic |accessdate=20 October 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.thefader.com/2015/05/01/lil-ugly-manes-long-retirement-from-rap |last=Cooper |first=Duncan |title=Why Did One of the Internet's Most Creative Rappers Quit? |website=The Fader |date=1 May 2015 |accessdate=20 October 2021}}</ref>

Miller announced he would release one final album under the Lil Ugly Mane name, and began sporadically releasing compilations of beats and older material on Bandcamp, including the ''Three Sided Tape'' series, the final instalment of which, ''Third Side of Tape'', received positive coverage from [[Anthony Fantano]] of The Needle Drop among others.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4N5E0yp2EA |last=theneedledrop |title=Lil Ugly Mane - Third Side of Tape REVIEW |website=YouTube |date=25 June 2015 |accessdate=20 October 2021}}</ref> In 2015, Miller released what was intended to be the final Lil Ugly Mane album - ''[[Oblivion Access]]'' and the final Shawn Kemp project - ''Trick Dice'', a collaboration with rapper [[Nickelus F]]. ''Oblivion Access'' saw Lil Ugly Mane taking a more experimental approach divorced from his earlier '90s Southern rap influences.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://liluglymane.bandcamp.com/album/oblivion-access |title=LIL UGLY MANE - Oblivion Access |website=Bandcamp |date=18 December 2015 |accessdate=20 October 2021}}</ref>

In 2017, Miller announced he would continue rapping under the name Bedwetter and released his debut project under the name - ''Volume 1: Flick Your Tongue Against Your Teeth and Describe the Present''. The album continued with the more introspective and experimental style of ''Oblivion Access''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://liluglymane.bandcamp.com/album/volume-1-flick-your-tongue-against-your-teeth-and-describe-the-present |title=bedwetter - volume 1: flick your tongue against your teeth and describe the present |website=Bandcamp |date=29 January 2017 |accessdate=20 October 2021}}</ref> Around the same time however, Miller began rapping under the Lil Ugly Mane name again as part of the group Secret Circle with [[Antwon]] and [[Wiki (rapper)|Wiki]]. After releasing a few singles, the group disbanded and scrapped their debut album due to a personal falling out.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.brooklynvegan.com/secret-circle-break-up-actions-have-consequences-says-wiki/ |title=Secret Circle break up - "actions have consequences", says Wiki |website=Brooklyn Vegan |date=18 May 2018 |accessdate=20 October 2021}}</ref> Miller began working with the remaining members of [[GothBoiClique]], however then appeared to go on hiatus, only releasing small collections of older material sporadically.

In 2021, Miller began releasing new music under the Lil Ugly Mane name. He released the single "Headboard", followed by "Porcelain Slightly" and then his third major release under the Lil Ugly Mane name - ''Volcanic Bird Enemy and the Voiced Concern'', which was covered positively by [[Sputnik Music]] and [[Stereogum]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/83906/Lil-Ugly-Mane-VOLCANIC-BIRD-ENEMY-AND-THE-VOICED-CONCERN/ |last=Rowan5215 |title=Lil Ugly Mane - Volcanic Bird Enemy... |website=Sputnik Music |date=11 October 2021 |accessdate=20 October 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.stereogum.com/2163621/stream-lil-ugly-manes-strange-new-surprise-album-volcanic-bird-enemy-and-the-voiced-concern/music/ |last=Breihan |first=Tom |title=Stream Lil Ugly Mane's Strange New Surprise Album ''Volcanic Bird Enemy and the Voiced Concern'' |website=Stereogum |date=12 October 2021 |accessdate=20 October 2021}}</ref> Around the same time, Miller released a new black metal demo under the Vudmurk name.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://liluglymane.bandcamp.com/album/obedient-form |title=VUDMURK - OBEDIENT FORM |website=Bandcamp |date=2 October 2021 |accessdate=20 October 2021}}</ref>
