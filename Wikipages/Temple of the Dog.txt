'''Temple of the Dog''' was an American rock [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] that formed in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] in 1990. It was conceived by vocalist [[Chris Cornell]] of [[Soundgarden]] as a tribute to his friend, the late [[Andrew Wood (singer)|Andrew Wood]], lead singer of the bands [[Malfunkshun]] and [[Mother Love Bone]]. The lineup included [[Stone Gossard]] on rhythm guitar, [[Jeff Ament]] on bass guitar (both ex-members of Mother Love Bone and later [[Pearl Jam]]), [[Mike McCready]] (later Pearl Jam) on lead guitar, and [[Matt Cameron]] (Soundgarden and later Pearl Jam) on drums. [[Eddie Vedder]] appeared as a guest to provide some lead and backing vocals.

The band released its only album, the self-titled ''[[Temple of the Dog (album)|Temple of the Dog]]'', in April 1991 through [[A&M Records]]. The recording sessions took place in November and December 1990 at [[London Bridge Studio]]s in Seattle, Washington, with producer [[Rick Parashar|Rakesh "Rick" Parashar]]. Although earning praise from music critics at the time of its release, the album was not widely recognized until 1992, when Vedder, Ament, Gossard, and McCready had their breakthrough with Pearl Jam. Cameron would later join Pearl Jam, serving as drummer since 1998.

The band reformed and toured in 2016, for celebration of the 25th anniversary of their self-titled album, which is their very first and only tour ever since their inception.

==History==
Temple of the Dog was started by Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell, who had been a roommate of Andrew Wood, the lead singer of Malfunkshun and Mother Love Bone.<ref name="Rip Magazine - Life Rules">Turman, Katherine. "Life Rules." ''[[RIP (magazine)|RIP]]''. October 1991</ref> Wood died on March 19, 1990, of a [[Drug overdose|heroin overdose]], the day Cornell got back from a tour.<ref name="Fivehorizons.com - KISW 99.9 FM: Seattle, Radio Interview by Damon Stewart in The New Music Hour with Chris Cornell, Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard">{{cite web|title=KISW 99.9 FM: Seattle, Radio Interview by Damon Stewart in The New Music Hour with Chris Cornell, Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard|author=Nicholls, Justin|publisher=Fivehorizons.com|url=http://www.fivehorizons.com/archive/articles/radio041491.shtml|access-date=2007-10-03|date=1991-04-14}}</ref> As he went on to tour Europe a few days later, he started writing songs in tribute to his late friend.<ref name="Rip Magazine - Life Rules"/> The result was two songs, "Reach Down" and "[[Say Hello 2 Heaven]]", which he recorded as soon as he returned home from touring.<ref name="Rip Magazine - Life Rules"/>

The recorded material was slow and melodic, musically different from the aggressive [[rock music]] of Soundgarden.<ref>{{cite web|title=A conversation with Chris Cornell part 2|author=O'Brien, Clare|publisher=Chris Cornell Fan Page|url=http://www.chriscornell.org.uk/articles/conversationwithchriscornellpart2.htm|access-date=2007-10-03|date=2007-06-27|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011100822/http://chriscornell.org.uk/articles/conversationwithchriscornellpart2.htm|archive-date=October 11, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Cornell approached Wood's former bandmates, Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament—who were still figuring out how to continue without Mother Love Bone—with the intention of releasing the songs as a single.<ref name="Fivehorizons.com - KISW 99.9 FM: Seattle, Radio Interview by Damon Stewart in The New Music Hour with Chris Cornell, Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard"/> Ament described the collaboration as "a really good thing at the time" for Gossard and him that put them into a "band situation where we could play and make music."<ref name="Fivehorizons.com - KISW 99.9 FM: Seattle, Radio Interview by Damon Stewart in The New Music Hour with Chris Cornell, Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard"/> The band's lineup was completed by the addition of Soundgarden (and later Pearl Jam) drummer Matt Cameron and future Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McCready. They named themselves Temple of the Dog, a reference to a line in the lyrics of the Mother Love Bone song "Man of Golden Words".<ref name="Rip Magazine - Life Rules"/>

The band started rehearsing "Reach Down", "Say Hello 2 Heaven", and other songs that Cornell had written on tour prior to Wood's death, as well as re-working some existing material from demos written by Gossard, Ament, and Cameron.<ref name="Guitar World - Requiem for a Heavyweight">Alden, Grant.

The release of a single was soon deemed a "stupid idea" by Cornell and dropped in favor of an [[Extended play|EP]] or [[album]].<ref name="Rip Magazine - Life Rules"/> The album was recorded in only 15 days, produced by the band themselves.<ref name="Rip Magazine - Life Rules"/> Gossard described the recording process as a "non-pressure-filled" situation, as there were no expectations or pressure coming from the record company.<ref name="Fivehorizons.com - KISW 99.9 FM: Seattle, Radio Interview by Damon Stewart in The New Music Hour with Chris Cornell, Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard"/> Eddie Vedder, who had flown up from [[San Diego]] to Seattle to audition for Ament, Gossard, and McCready to be the singer of a band initially billing themselves as Mookie Blaylock (so named for [[Mookie Blaylock|a basketball player]] but eventually settling on Pearl Jam), was at one of the Temple of the Dog rehearsals and ended up providing backing vocals.<ref name="Ultimate Guitar Archive - Chris Cornell Open To Revisiting Temple">{{cite news|title=Chris Cornell Open To Revisiting Temple|publisher=[[Ultimate Guitar Archive]]|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/video_news/chris_cornell_open_to_revisiting_temple.html|access-date=2007-10-03|date=2007-09-14}}</ref> "[[Hunger Strike (song)|Hunger Strike]]" became a duet between Cornell and Vedder.

''[[Temple of the Dog (album)|Temple of the Dog]]'' was released on April 16, 1991, through A&M Records and initially sold 70,000 copies in the [[United States]].<ref name="Guitar World - Requiem for a Heavyweight"/> Ament recalled requesting that A&M include a Pearl Jam sticker on the cover—as they had just picked their new name—because "it'll be a good thing for us", but they refused.<ref name="Guitar World - Requiem for a Heavyweight"/> The album received favorable reviews<ref>{{cite web|title=((( Temple of the Dog > Biography )))|author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|website=[[AllMusic]]|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p26061|pure_url=yes}}|access-date=2007-10-03}}</ref> but failed to chart. Critic Steve Huey of [[AllMusic]] later rated the album with four-and-a-half stars out of five, stating that the "record sounds like a bridge between Mother Love Bone's theatrical '70s-rock updates and Pearl Jam's [[Hard rock|hard-rocking]] seriousness."<ref>{{cite web|title=((( Temple of the Dog > Review )))|author=Huey, Steve|website=[[AllMusic]]|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r19777|pure_url=yes}}|access-date=2007-10-03}}</ref> [[David Fricke]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' also wrote in retrospect that the album "deserves immortality."<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Temple of the Dog: ''Temple of the Dog''|author=Fricke, David|magazine=Rolling Stone|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/301499/review/5944099|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213231541/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/301499/review/5944099|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 13, 2008|access-date=2007-10-03|date=2000-12-14}}</ref> The band members were pleased with the material, as it achieved its purpose; Cornell believed that "Andy really would have liked" the songs,<ref name="Fivehorizons.com - KISW 99.9 FM: Seattle, Radio Interview by Damon Stewart in The New Music Hour with Chris Cornell, Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard"/> and Gossard also asserted that he thought Wood would be "blown away by the whole thing".<ref name="Rip Magazine - Life Rules"/> Soon after the album's release, Soundgarden and Pearl Jam embarked on recording their next albums, which resulted in ''[[Badmotorfinger]]'' and ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]'', respectively, and the Temple of the Dog project was brought to a close, without a promotional tour for the album.

In the summer of 1992, the album received new attention. Although it had been released more than a year earlier, A&M Records realized that they had in their catalog what was essentially a collaboration between Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, who had both risen to mainstream attention in the months since the album's release with their respective albums, ''Badmotorfinger'' and ''Ten''. A&M decided to reissue the album and promote "Hunger Strike" as a single with an accompanying [[music video]] that had been previously filmed. The attention allowed both the album and single to chart on [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'']] and resulted in a boost in album sales. The album was among the 100 top-selling albums of 1992.<ref>Lyons, James. ''Selling Seattle: Representing Contemporary Urban America''.

Ament, Cameron, Cornell, and McCready later reunited under the name M.A.C.C. to record a cover of [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s "Hey Baby (Land of the New Rising Sun)" for the 1993 tribute album ''[[Stone Free: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix]]''.  The song has since been included as part of the band's live set. In a 2007 interview with [[Ultimate Guitar Archive]], Cornell stated he would be open for a Temple of the Dog reunion, or "some collaboration with any combination of those guys".<ref name="Ultimate Guitar Archive - Chris Cornell Open To Revisiting Temple"/> He also revealed that Temple of the Dog was the reason he joined [[Audioslave]], as the experience made him "keep an open mind" about collaborations with musicians from other bands.<ref name="Ultimate Guitar Archive - Chris Cornell Open To Revisiting Temple"/>

Temple of the Dog was among hundreds of artists whose material was destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite news|last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=28 June 2019 |date=25 June 2019}}</ref>

==Live performances==
During their initial existence the only time Temple of the Dog played a full one-hour set was while rehearsing and writing the material for the album. The band (with the exception of Vedder) performed in Seattle at the Off Ramp Café on November 13, 1990.<ref name="Fivehorizons.com - Pearl Jam: 1990/1991 Concert Chronology">{{cite web|url=http://www.fivehorizons.com/tour/cc/t199091.shtml|title=Pearl Jam: 1990/1991 Concert Chronology|access-date=2007-10-03|publisher=Fivehorizons.com}}</ref> They also opened for [[Alice in Chains]], following the short lived Seattle group Panic, on December 22, 1990, at the Moore Theatre in Seattle. In the time since the album's release, the band has re-formed for short live one-off performances on occasions where both Soundgarden and Pearl Jam were performing.

At a Pearl Jam show at the [[Santa Barbara Bowl]] in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], California, on October 28, 2003, Cornell joined the band on-stage, effectively reuniting Temple of the Dog (Cameron had been the drummer for Pearl Jam since 1998) for renditions of "Hunger Strike" and "Reach Down".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fivehorizons.com/tour/cc/t2003p3.shtml|title=Pearl Jam: 2003 Concert Chronology part 3|access-date=2007-10-03|publisher=Fivehorizons.com}}</ref> Cornell also performed [[Audioslave|Audioslave's]] "Like a Stone" and [[Chris Cornell|Chris Cornell's]] "Can't Change Me".
