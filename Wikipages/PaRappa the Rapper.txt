{{nihongo foot|'''''PaRappa the Rapper'''''|パラッパラッパー|Parappa Rappā|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[rhythm game]] developed by [[NanaOn-Sha]]. It was published by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in Japan in 1996 and worldwide in 1997. Created by music producer [[Masaya Matsuura]] in collaboration with artist Rodney Greenblat, the game features unique visual design and [[rapping|rap]]-based gameplay and is considered the first true rhythm game.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Davis |first1=Justin |title=The History of Music Games |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/21/the-history-of-music-games |publisher=[[IGN]] |access-date=18 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180531220623/https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/21/the-history-of-music-games |archive-date=31 May 2018 |date=21 October 2014}}</ref> It was ported to the [[PlayStation Portable]] in 2006 in celebration of its 10 year anniversary. A remastered version of the original PlayStation game was released for [[PlayStation 4]] in 2017 for the game's twentieth anniversary.

The game was very well received by critics, who praised its music, story, animation, and gameplay, though its short length was criticized. It spawned two follow-up titles; a [[electric guitar|guitar]]-based spin-off titled ''[[Um Jammer Lammy]]'', released in 1999 for the PlayStation, and a direct sequel, ''[[PaRappa the Rapper 2]]'', released for the [[PlayStation 2]] in 2001. Several publications list it as [[Lists of games considered the best|one of the best video games ever made]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:PaRappa_the_Rapper_gameplay_screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|An example of gameplay in ''PaRappa the Rapper''. The player must match the symbols on-screen with their button presses in accordance to the rhythm of the song.]]
''PaRappa the Rapper'' is a rhythm game in which the main character, [[PaRappa]], must make his way through each of the game's six stages by rapping. As the teacher raps, a bar at the top of the screen will appear, showing symbols that match up to the teacher's lyrics.<ref name=EGM99>{{cite magazine |title=PaRappa the Rapper: Love, Friendship and Diarrhea |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=99 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=October 1997|page=156}}</ref> The player must then make Parappa rap in response to the teacher by pressing the buttons with the correct timing to match the teacher's line.

During gameplay, a "U Rappin'" meter determines the player's performance, ranking it as either Awful, Bad, Good or Cool. By consistently staying on beat, players will stay in the Good ranking area. If the player performs a bad line, a lower ranking will flash, and if the player performs badly twice in a row, they will drop to Bad, followed by Awful. To regain a higher ranking, the player must play well twice in a row to move up a rank. To clear a stage, the player must have a Good ranking by the end of the song. If the player ends the song on a Bad or Awful ranking, or drops below Awful ranking at any point in the song, they will fail the song and have to start over. After the game has been cleared once, the player can attempt to achieve a Cool ranking. This is achieved by freestyling in a manner different from the predetermined lyric. If the player performs a successfully impressive freestyle when the Cool rank is flashing, they will enter Cool mode. In this mode, the teacher will leave the stage, allowing the player to rap freely and earn some large points. If the freestyling fails to impress twice in a row, the teacher will return and gameplay will resume in the Good ranking. Ending the stage with a Cool rank results in a special level ending, and clearing all stages on Cool Mode unlocks a bonus mode with characters Katy Kat and Sunny Funny.

Rank-changing aspects of a level are only apparent during the first of every two lines. If the player successfully times the first line of a pair, but fails on the second, the rank meter will not blink Bad or Awful. Likewise, once the game has been cleared, a Good play is only necessary on the first of every two lines to be able to get Cool mode on the second line.

==Plot==
The player takes on the role of [[PaRappa]], a paper-thin [[rapping]] [[dog]], who is trying to win the heart of a [[flower]]-like girl named Sunny Funny. However, he is intimidated by the presence of Joe Chin, a rich, [[narcissism|narcissistic]] dog who goes overboard with his attempts to impress Sunny. To impress Sunny Funny, PaRappa learns to fight at a [[karate]] [[dojo]], and takes a driver's education course to get his license. However, when he crashes his dad's car, he has to earn money at a flea market to pay for it. When Sunny's birthday comes up, PaRappa has to get her a cake, but ends up ruining it after an encounter with Joe. He makes a new one by watching a cooking show and proceeds to eat a lot of it on the day. When spending some time alone with Sunny, he is suddenly overcome with the need to go to the bathroom and has to rap against his former teachers to get to the front of the queue. Then one night, PaRappa is invited to Club Fun, and asks Sunny to go with him, to which she agrees. PaRappa then raps on stage with everybody, rapping solo at the end of the song and expressing his feelings for Sunny.

==Development==
[[File:Masaya-matsuura (cropped).jpg|thumb|Lead designer [[Masaya Matsuura]]]]
The game was designed by [[Masaya Matsuura]], who at the time was a musician in the band ''[[Psy-S|PSY.S]]''. Matsuura hated appearing in [[music videos]] and began working on interactive software as an alternative outlet.<ref name=Untoldstory>{{cite web |last=Accordino |first=Nick |title=Interview: The Untold Story of PaRappa the Rapper |url=https://blog.playstation.com/2017/04/04/interview-the-untold-story-of-parappa-the-rapper/ |website=Playstation Blog |date=4 April 2017 |access-date=9 July 2020}}</ref> Game development started in 1994, before the release of the PlayStation. At the time Sony Computer Entertainment was attempting to produce as many games as they could, which were worked on in two divisions. One division worked on popular genres and the other, internally known as "Division Zero", according to artist Rodney Greenblat, "just did whatever". [[PaRappa]] was a product of Division Zero.<ref name="Almostmario">{{cite web |last1=Hawkins |first1=Matthew |title=Interview: Rodney Greenblat, The Mother of Sony's Almost Mario |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/130752/interview_rodney_greenblat_the_.php |website=Gamasuitra |access-date=9 July 2020}}</ref>

Greenblat got involved with the project after an SCE producer suggested that he and Matsuura work together, having both expressed interest in working with the PlayStation console. Greenblat had already worked with other divisions within Sony and was fairly popular in Japan, particularly for his CD-Rom ''Dazzeloids''.<ref name=Untoldstory/><ref name=Almostmario/> Similar to the ''[[Paper Mario]]'' series, all of the characters appear to be two-dimensional beings cut from paper while the surroundings are primarily three-dimensional.<ref name=NGen25>{{cite magazine |title=NG Alphas: PaRappa the Rapper|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=25|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=January 1997|page=84}}</ref> On his website, Greenblat remembers that making the characters flat was Matsuura's idea, after creating a mock-up with characters from Greenblat's Dazzeloids CD-ROM.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://whimsyload.com/character-club/parappa-the-rapper/|title = Parappa the Rapper|access-date = 3 July 2014|website = Whimsyload|last = Greenblat|first = Rodney Alan|quote = When I went to meet Matsuura’s team, they had already made a crude animation demo of the rap-music-simon-says-game using my characters from my 1993 CD-ROM ''Dazzeloids''. Matsuura’s animation people loved the flatness of my work, and thought of creating flat characters who move around in a 3D world.}}</ref> The game's title is a word play referencing the flat characters; "PaRappa" is a variant of the Japanese word for "paper thin".<ref name=NGen25/>
 
After deciding on designing a music game Matsuura went through multiple ideas such as having a game centered around singing or playing the guitar.<ref name="shmuplations.com">{{Cite web |author=blackoak|url=http://shmuplations.com/parappa/|title=Translated PaRappa the Rapper Developer Interview|website=shmuplations.com |language=en|access-date=2017-08-06}}</ref> Matsuura was particularly inspired by the musical practice of sampling and claimed "the most interesting thing about sampling was people’s voices", and thus wanted to create a music game using actual voices and by extension one based around rap.<ref name=Untoldstory/> By the time Greenblat began working on the game, the basic structure of the game had formed. Greenblat would create characters based on outlines created by Matsuura.<ref name=Almostmario/> Several of the main characters were already designed and owned by Greenblat, including PJ Berry and Katty Kat. One of the first designs Greenblat created specifically for the game was that of the main character, PaRappa, who initially took the form of a [[shrimp]].<ref name=Untoldstory/> Occasionally Greenblat's designs would cause the game's story to change. Greenblat noted that he ended up having more input because the other team members felt that some of his characters exceeded their expectations, which prompted the writers to adapt to his characters by changing the story itself. For instance, after Greenblat came up with the idea of an onion for the Karate teacher character, the idea was changed to make him an onion master.<ref name=Almostmario/> The game's soundtrack was made using samplers rather than MIDI synthesizers, which were common at the time.<ref name="shmuplations.com"/> Initially all of the teachers' songs used sampled vocals. These could, however, not be used in the final game and were redone "while maintaining the concept of each tune".<ref name=Untoldstory/> The lyrics were written in Japanese by Matsuura, and then translated by rapper Ryu Watabe while he was freestyling.<ref name="shmuplations.com"/> All of the music was recorded at a studio in [[New York City|New York]].<ref name=EGM99/> The game also is one of the first PlayStation games to use in-game motion capture in order to portray more realistic character movement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.whimsyload.com/media.items/parappa/paraInterview.html |title=Interview About Parappa|website=www.whimsyload.com|access-date=2017-08-06}}</ref>

Promotion for the game proved to be somewhat of a problem. Prior to Parappa there had been no similar games, and the team struggled with what genre to market the game as. Many staff members at Sony felt that Parappa did not qualify as a game and Matsuura himself recalls initially being unsure as well.<ref name="Untoldstory"/> The game, however, became massively successful, which prompted SCEA, despite having a strict policy against 2D games, to release the game in North America. According to Greenblat, SCEA did not know how to market the game and aimed its marketing primarily at children, a demographic he noted would have trouble completing the game.<ref name="Almostmario"/>

''PaRappa the Rapper Remastered'' received mixed or average reviews. It was praised for keeping the charm of the original game while improving on the graphical quality, but was criticised for only improving the graphics of the gameplay and not the cutscenes. Caitlin Cooke of ''Destructoid'' wrote that "The remastered version does not include a calibration setting. This works very much against ''PaRappa'''s favor as there’s an extremely noticeable lag throughout each of the levels, causing havoc when trying to hit the notes on time."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/review-parappa-the-rapper-remastered-429305.phtml|title=Review: PaRappa the Rapper Remastered|last=Cooke|first=Caitlin|date=3 April 2017|website=Destructoid|access-date=6 August 2017}}</ref> Stuart Andrews of Trusted Reviews wrote: "I love PaRappa and his 'I gotta believe' attitude, but this early rhythm action game no longer holds up."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/parappa-the-rapper-remastered|title=PaRappa The Rapper Remastered Review|date=19 April 2017|website=Trusted Reviews|access-date=14 December 2018}}</ref>

In 1999, ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' listed ''PaRappa the Rapper'' as number 36 on their "Top 50 Games of All Time", commenting that "''PaRappa'' has to be played to truly understand how wonderful it is, and it appeals to both young and old, men and women, hardcore gamers and people who have never held a controller before in their lives."<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Top 50 Games of All Time |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=50  |date=February 1999|page=75}}</ref>
