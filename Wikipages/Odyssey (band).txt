Now based in the United Kingdom, the band is led and fronted by Steven Collazo and continues to perform and record.

==Career==

Filipino bassist and singer Tony Reynolds joined the group soon after "Native New Yorker" reached no. 21 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], no. 5 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. A string of [[album]]s and [[Single (music)|singles]] followed and the group managed another [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] chart hit, "Inside Out", written by [[Jesse Rae]], produced by Jimmy Douglass and featuring music performed by [[session musician]]s. It peaked on the US charts at no. 12 and in the UK went to no. 3 in 1982.<ref>{{cite web|first= Ed |last= Hogan |title= Inside Out – Song Review |publisher= AllMusic |url= https://www.allmusic.com/song/inside-out-mt0035127777 |access-date= July 30, 2014}}</ref> The song was ranked at number 15 among the "Tracks of the Year" for 1982 by ''[[NME]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title= 1982 Best Albums and Tracks of the Year |magazine= [[NME]] |date= October 10, 2016 |access-date= February 16, 2018 |url= https://www.nme.com/bestalbumsandtracksoftheyear/1982-2-1045396}}</ref>

Reynolds, for unknown reasons, left after the first album and was replaced by [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]], [[North Carolina]] native William "Bill" McEachern, who remained with the group throughout the remainder of its [[RCA Records]] output.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|editor-first= Colin |editor-last= Larkin |editor-link= Colin Larkin (writer) |date= 1997 |title= [[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] |page= 916 |publisher= [[Virgin Books]] |edition= Concise |isbn= 1-85227-745-9}}</ref> During that time, Brooklyn-born Steven Collazo joined the group as keyboardist, vocalist and musical director. Tony Reynolds died on February 2, 2010 in [[Jamaica, Queens]], New York.

In the [[United Kingdom]], the band, with its diverse musical style had more chart success, totalling five [[Top 40|Top Ten]] hits between 1977 and 1982.<ref name="Roberts"/> One of them, "[[Use It Up and Wear It Out]]", reached number one in the UK Singles Chart for two weeks in 1980.<ref name="Larkin"/> The UK follow-up single, "[[If You're Lookin' for a Way Out]]" had Lillian Lopez on lead vocals; the single reaching no. 6 in 1980 and spending a total of fifteen weeks in the UK chart.<ref name="Roberts">{{cite book|first= David |last= Roberts |year= 2006 |title= [[British Hit Singles & Albums]] |edition= 19th |publisher= [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Records Limited]] |location= London |isbn= 1-904994-10-5 |page= 404}}</ref> Odyssey thus became the third US act of the year (after [[Fern Kinney]] and [[Suicide Is Painless|M.A.S.H.]]) to reach number one in the UK despite not charting in their home country.<ref>{{cite book|first= David |last= Roberts |year= 2001 |title= British Hit Singles |edition= 14th |publisher= Guinness World Records Limited |location= London |page= 49 |isbn= 0-85156-156-X}}</ref> Their later hit "Going Back to My Roots" was written and originally recorded by [[Lamont Dozier]].<ref>{{cite web|first= Ed |last= Hogan |title= Going Back to My Roots – Song Review |publisher= [[AllMusic]] |url= https://www.allmusic.com/song/going-back-to-my-roots-mt0028631245 |access-date= May 20, 2015}}</ref>

After leaving RCA, Odyssey, composed of lead vocalist Lillian Lopez, Al Jackson and Steven Collazo, continued touring, performing, and making television appearances throughout the United Kingdom, Europe and the Middle East.

==Legacy==
Odyssey's "If You're Looking for a Way Out" was [[Cover version|covered]] by [[Tindersticks]] on their 1999 album, ''[[Simple Pleasure]]''. "Inside Out" was covered by [[Electribe 101]] on their 1990 album ''[[Electribal Memories]]'' and subsequently released as a single. Other covers of Odyssey's material include "Don't Tell Me Tell Her" by [[Phyllis Hyman]] and "Native New Yorker" by [[Esther Phillips]], amongst others. The band, now led by Steven Collazo, featured vocalist twins Annis and Anne Peters and released the album ''Legacy'' in June 2011 on ISM Records. The twins left the group in January 2013, and were replaced by song stylist Jerdene Wilson and recording artist [[Romina Johnson]]. Johnson is known for her vocals and collaboration with [[Artful Dodger (duo)|Artful Dodger]] on the 2000 hit song "[[Movin' Too Fast]]". In 2014–15, Odyssey released their ''Together EP'' via ISM records.
