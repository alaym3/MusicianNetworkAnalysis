===German television prank===

In March 2017, Gosling was at the center of a [[prank]] involving [[Goldene Kamera]], an annual German film and television award. German comedians [[Joko Winterscheidt]] and [[Klaas Heufer-Umlauf]] arranged for a Ryan Gosling [[impersonator]] to be awarded the "Best International Film" prize for ''La La Land''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/movies/goslinggate-is-this-the-greatest-tv-prank-ever-20170309-guu52p.html|title=#GoslingGate: is this the greatest TV prank ever?|date=March 9, 2017|work=Brisbane Times|last=Moran|first=Rob|access-date=February 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170311221454/https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/movies/goslinggate-is-this-the-greatest-tv-prank-ever-20170309-guu52p.html|archive-date=March 11, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.brainstain.co.uk/2017/03/08/goslinggate-golden-camera-awards-germany/|title=#GoslingGate at The Golden Camera Awards in Germany|website=brainstain.co.uk|date=March 8, 2017|access-date=February 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214074533/https://www.brainstain.co.uk/2017/03/08/goslinggate-golden-camera-awards-germany/|archive-date=December 14, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/story-behind-ryan-gosling-german-awards-show-prank-984529|title=How Two German Comedians Pranked an Awards Show With a Fake Ryan Gosling|website=The Hollywood Reporter|date=March 8, 2017|access-date=February 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308223738/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/story-behind-ryan-gosling-german-awards-show-prank-984529|archive-date=March 8, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Following the event, a speaker for television broadcaster [[ZDF]] asked for the trophy to be given back, stating that ''La La Land'' had won the prize and that the trophy would be given to the real Ryan Gosling.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://rp-online.de/panorama/fernsehen/goldene-kamera-2017-veranstalter-fordern-trophaee-zurueck_aid-17755893|language=de|title=Goldene Kamera 2017: Veranstalter fordern Trophäe zurück|trans-title=Goldene Kamera 2017: Organizer reclaims trophy|work=Rheinische Post|date=March 7, 2017|access-date=February 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200213214108/https://rp-online.de/panorama/fernsehen/goldene-kamera-2017-veranstalter-fordern-trophaee-zurueck_aid-17755893|archive-date=February 13, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The incident, which became known as "GoslingGate", sparked criticism of the event's concept. Media critics argued that the "Best International Film" award had only been created in an effort to get Ryan Gosling on the show, with no regards for the movie's quality. The incident played a major role in the cancelation of the Goldene Kamera in 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dwdl.de/nachrichten/73880/miese_quote_mieser_ruf_aus_fuer_goldene_kamera/|title=Miese Quote, mieser Ruf: Aus für Goldene Kamera|language=de|trans-title=Bad ratings, bad reputation: The end for Goldene Kamera|date=September 5, 2019|first=Thomas|last=Lückerath|website=dwdl.de|access-date=February 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200213215453/https://www.dwdl.de/nachrichten/73880/miese_quote_mieser_ruf_aus_fuer_goldene_kamera/?utm_source=&utm_medium=&utm_campaign=&utm_term=|archive-date=February 13, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.quotenmeter.de/n/115772/sendetermin-fuer-die-letzte-goldene-kamera-steht|website=quotenmeter.de|title=Sendetermin für die letzte "Goldene Kamera" steht|trans-title=Air date for the final "Goldene Kamera" announced|language=de|date=February 11, 2020|access-date=February 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200213221027/http://www.quotenmeter.de/n/115772/sendetermin-fuer-die-letzte-goldene-kamera-steht|archive-date=February 13, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2018, Winterscheidt, Heufer-Umlauf and the Gosling [[Look-alike|double]] Ludwig Lehner were awarded the [[Grimme Award]] for their [[media criticism]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.stern.de/kultur/grimme-preis-der-falsche-ryan-gosling-wird-ausgezeichnet-7900918.html|website=Stern|date=March 14, 2018|title=Grimme-Preis: Der falsche Ryan Gosling wird ausgezeichnet|trans-title=Grimme Award: The false Ryan Gosling will be awarded|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314211907/https://www.stern.de/kultur/grimme-preis-der-falsche-ryan-gosling-wird-ausgezeichnet-7900918.html|archive-date=March 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grimme-preis.de/archiv/2018/preistraeger/p/d/ludwig-lehner/|title=Ludwig Lehner - Preisträger|website=grimme-preis.de|year=2018|access-date=April 28, 2020|language=de}}</ref>
