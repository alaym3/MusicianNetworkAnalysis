==Early life and name origin==
Alexander James O’Connor was born on 4 May 1998, to Nina and Phil O’Connor, a professional sports photographer. He grew up in the village of [[Grayshott]] near [[Haslemere]], [[Surrey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/a3ewy8/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-rex-orange-county |title=10 things you need to know about rex orange county |publisher=Vice |first=Frankie |last=Dunn |date=May 11, 2017}}</ref><ref name="Vice">{{cite web|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/kzz47e/rex-orange-county-interview-2017|title=Rex Orange County: The Emotionally Visual Mastermind of the Next Generation|website=noisey.vice.com|date= 11 September 2017|publisher= Ryan Bassil}}</ref> O’Connor’s interest in music began at a young age. At age 5, O'Connor joined the choir at the school where his mother worked.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://pigeonsandplanes.com/interviews/2017/08/rex-orange-county-interview|title=Rex Orange County's Road From School Choir to 'Flower Boy’|work=PigeonsandPlanes|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181115031059/https://pigeonsandplanes.com/interviews/2017/08/rex-orange-county-interview|archive-date=2018-11-15|url-status=dead}}</ref> He became a drummer and later taught himself piano.

The name Rex Orange County is based on a teacher-given nickname, "The OC", after his surname O'Connor.<ref name="The Guardian, 18 Nov 2017">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/18/one-to-watch-rex-orange-county-alex-oconnor-tyler-creator|title=One to watch: Rex Orange County|last=Joshi|first=Tara|date=18 November 2017|work=The Guardian}}</ref> O’Connor attended [[Frensham Heights School]] in [[Farnham]], Surrey.

==Career==
===2014–2016: Early career, ''Bcos U Will Never B Free'' and ''Flower Boy''===
At age 16, O’Connor picked up the guitar and started to produce his own music using [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]’s [[Logic Pro|Logic]] software. <ref name="The Guardian, 18 Nov 2017" /><ref name="Vice" /> At this age, he also began attending the [[BRIT School]] where he studied drumming and was one of four percussionists in his year; the relative rareness of his primary instrument provided him with wide exposure to various projects of others in his school which he credits to exposing him to new and fresh music.<ref name=":0" /> 

On 4 September 2015, O’Connor self-released his debut album ''Bcos U Will Never B Free'' on [[SoundCloud]] and [[Bandcamp]].<ref name="Vice" /> Upon listening to the album, fellow English musician and producer [[Two Inch Punch]] got in touch with O’Connor, providing him with a management team. The two have continued to collaborate throughout O’Connor’s career in the form of the tracks "UNO", "Best Friend", and "Untitled". The album also caught the attention of American rapper [[Tyler, the Creator]], who sent O’Connor an email describing his enjoyment of the project. This led to him flying O’Connor out the following year to [[Los Angeles|L.A.]] to collaborate on his then-upcoming album ''[[Flower Boy]]'',<ref name=":1" /> with O’Connor co-writing and contributing vocals to the songs "Boredom" and "Foreword".<ref name="idsnews" /> On 17 November 2016, O’Connor released the single “UNO”, a song ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]'' magazine described by writing, "The buoyant keyboard riff underpins a hypnotic half-spoken vocal, one that veers from topic to topic in a hazy burst of creative mania."<ref name="Clash">{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/news/rex-orange-county-shares-uno|title=Rex Orange County Shares 'UNO'|date=17 Dec 2016|work=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]}}</ref> On 25 January 2017, O’Connor released the single “Best Friend” (premiering on [[Apple Music]]’s [[Beats 1]] station), followed later in the year by the release of his second album ''[[Apricot Princess]]''.<ref name="idsnews">{{cite web|url=http://www.idsnews.com/article/2018/03/entmusiccolumn032218|title=COLUMN: Rex Orange County is an artist that cannot be labeled|date=23 Mar 2018|publisher=[[Indiana Daily Student]]}}</ref> O’Connor’s work has been compared to "other artsy, post-genre teen artists".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2017/05/25/rex-orange-county-apricot-princess-interview-gen-f |title=Rex Orange County Is Teenage Joy Personified |website=Thefader.com |access-date=2020-05-20}}</ref>

===2017-present: Post-''Apricot Princess'' and ''Pony''===
O’Connor’s first release following the success of ''Apricot Princess'' and ''Flower Boy'' was on 11 October 2017 with the single "Loving Is Easy", created in collaboration with the Dutch artist [[Benny Sings]].<ref name="idsnews" /> On 16 April 2018, O’Connor performed the song in his television debut on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]''.<ref name="Substream Magazine">{{cite web|url=https://substreammagazine.com/2018/04/rex-orange-county-performs-loving-is-easy-on-the-tonight-show/|title=Rex Orange County performs "Loving Is Easy" on 'The Tonight Show'|date=17 April 2018|work=[[Substream Magazine]]}}</ref> On 31 May 2018, O’Connor released a cover of "[[You've Got a Friend in Me]]" in collaboration with [[Randy Newman]], the creator of the song.<ref name="Spin magazine">{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2018/05/rex-orange-county-youve-got-a-friend-in-me-cover-randy-newman/|title=Rex Orange County and Randy Newman – "You’ve Got a Friend in Me"|date=31 May 2018|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]}}</ref> He was also featured in [[Spotify|Spotify's]] Rise Program.<ref name=":1" /> 

On 9 October 2018, O’Connor was scheduled to appear on the French television programme ''[[Quotidien]]'', but refused to perform because it featured a sketch by comedian [[Alison Wheeler (comedian)|Alison Wheeler]] parodying the [[Ku Klux Klan]], which he called "tasteless".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Geffray |first1=Emilie |title=Quotidien s’explique après l’annulation du groupe de Rex Orange County |url=https://tvmag.lefigaro.fr/programme-tv/quotidien-s-explique-apres-l-annulation-du-groupe-de-rex-orange-county_52582b40-cd28-11e8-896c-7d05c73a49da/ |access-date=18 September 2020 |work=[[Le Figaro]] |date=11 October 2018 |language=fr}}</ref>

On 14 February 2019, O’Connor released the single "New House". Later that year, on 12 September, O’Connor released "10/10"; the lead single from his third album ''[[Pony (Rex Orange County album)|Pony]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/rex-orange-countys-new-album-pony-to-arrive-next-month-via-sony-music/|title=Rex Orange County's new album, Pony, to arrive next month via Sony Music|date=2019-09-19|website=Music Business Worldwide|access-date=2019-10-01}}</ref> Released on 25 October 2019, ''Pony'' was O’Connor’s first major-label album release through [[RCA Records]].<ref name="Jones2019"/> The album received a lukewarm reaction among critics, with [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] rating it a 5.0 out of 10. Associate Editor Anna Gaca described the album as "relentlessly juvenile"<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gaca|first=Anna|date=25 October 2019|title=Rex Orange County: Pony Album Review|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/rex-orange-county-pony/|access-date=20 October 2021|website=Coup De Main Magazine|language=en}}</ref> while criticizing its more "childlike" sound relative to his previous releases.

On 30 September 2020, O'Connor released an EP with recordings from his performance at [[Radio City Music Hall]] in [[New York City]] during his ''Pony'' tour titled ''Live at Radio City Music Hall'' alongside a documentary <ref>{{YouTube|J0-vfbaLY-8}}</ref> released on [[YouTube]]. This documentary showed the events leading up to this performance as well as the early conclusion of the ''Pony'' tour due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].

In October 2020, O'Connor confirmed that he was in the process of recording a 4th studio album titled ''Who Cares''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Graves|first=Shahlin|date=17 October 2020|url=https://www.coupdemainmagazine.com/rex-orange-county/17102|access-date=20 October 2021|title=Rex Orange County announces new album 'Who Cares?'.|website=Coup De Main Magazine|language=en}}</ref> In January 2021, he liked a Tweet seemingly confirming that it would be released at some point later that year.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Graves|first=Shahlin|date=14 January 2021|title=Rex Orange County confirms 2021 release for new album 'Who Cares?'.|url=https://www.coupdemainmagazine.com/rex-orange-county/17267|access-date=26 June 2021|website=Coup De Main Magazine|language=en}}</ref>

==Artistry==
Growing up, O’Connor listened to [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[ABBA]], [[Stevie Wonder]], and American alternative artists like [[Weezer]] and [[Green Day]].<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/sponsor-content/rex-orange-county-is-an-old-soul/|title=Rex Orange County is An Old Soul Moving at Lightspeed {{!}} Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-14}}</ref> He cites these artists and others as core inspiration for his own music.

==Personal life==
In 2015, O'Connor began a relationship with fellow British singer-songwriter Thea Morgan-Murrell (known professionally as Thea), having met while attending the BRIT School together. O'Connor has sung about Morgan-Murrell in a variety of his songs, and both have collaborated on the tracks "Sycamore Girl" and "Never Had The Balls".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://genius.com/artists/Thea |title=Thea |date=<!--Not stated--> |website=Genius |publisher=Genius |access-date=20 October 2021}}</ref> On 24 November 2020, O'Connor confirmed on [[Twitter]] that he and Morgan-Murrell were separated, tweeting "i am not in a relationship".<ref>{{Cite tweet |user=rexorangecounty |number=1331292204376203265 |title=i am not in a relationship}}</ref>

==Accolades==
In January 2018, O'Connor came in second in the [[BBC]] ''[[Sound of...|Sound of]] 2018'' award after Norwegian singer [[Sigrid (singer)|Sigrid]].<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1cV3lC483qtKJq7SXWdr1qL/the-longlist|title=The Longlist, Meet the 16 longlisted acts for BBC Music Sound of 2018|publisher=BBC}}</ref>
