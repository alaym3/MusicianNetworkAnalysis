He began recording music at the age of 11 and released a collaborative album with the Glorious Five, a group he and a couple of his church friends formed. In 2009, Wizkid signed a record deal with Banky W's [[Empire Mates Entertainment]] (E.M.E). He later rose to the limelight after releasing "[[Holla at Your Boy]]", the lead single from his debut studio album, ''[[Superstar (Wizkid album)|Superstar]]'' (2011), which also spawned the singles "[[Tease Me/Bad Guys]]" and "[[Don't Dull]]".

In September 2014, he released the self-titled second studio album, ''[[Ayo (Wizkid album)|Ayo]].'' The album was supported by six singles, including the song "[[Jaiye Jaiye]]".
