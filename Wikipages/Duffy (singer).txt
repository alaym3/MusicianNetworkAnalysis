'''Aimee Anne Duffy''' (born 23 June 1984) is a Welsh singer, songwriter and actress. Her debut album, ''[[Rockferry]]'', released in 2008, became the best-selling album in the United Kingdom that year and led to worldwide attention. It spawned the successful single "[[Mercy (Duffy song)|Mercy]]". In 2009, Duffy received the [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album]] for ''Rockferry'', one of three nominations, and won three out of four [[Brit Awards]] nominations, for British Breakthrough, Best British Female and Best British Album. In 2010, she made her acting debut in the film ''[[Patagonia (film)|Patagonia]]'' and released her second studio album ''[[Endlessly (album)|Endlessly]]'' to moderate success. 

In February 2011, Duffy announced an indefinite hiatus from music. She briefly returned in 2015, appearing in the film ''[[Legend (2015 film)|Legend]]'' and contributing three songs to its soundtrack, but has yet to make a full return to music. In 2020, she explained her long term absence from the music industry, saying she had been abducted and raped and wanted to recover.

According to Duffy's official website she is currently signed to Universal Recording Group.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Home {{!}} Duffy|url=http://duffy.com/|access-date=2020-10-26|website=duffy.com}}</ref>

At the age of 17, she attended the Pwllheli campus of [[Coleg Meirion-Dwyfor]] to study for A-levels. She subsequently went to the [[University of Chester]] and studied Commercial Music Production on the [[Warrington]] campus. From 2004, she studied Performing Arts at the Parkgate campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iccheshireonline.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0100regionalnews/tm_headline=chart-topper-duffy-worked-and-studied-in-chester&method=full&objectid=20507737&siteid=50020-name_page.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130705172624/http://iccheshireonline.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0100regionalnews/tm_headline=chart-topper-duffy-worked-and-studied-in-chester&method=full&objectid=20507737&siteid=50020-name_page.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 July 2013 |title=Chester Chronicle: Chester News, Chester FC, Sport & What's On |publisher=Iccheshireonline.icnetwork.co.uk |access-date=30 June 2014}}</ref>

In September 1998, at the age of 14, Duffy was briefly put in a police [[safe house]] when authorities uncovered a plot by her stepfather's ex-wife to pay a hitman £3,000 to kill her stepfather, Philip Smith.<!--This is the first mention of her having a stepfather; when did he marry her mother?--> Smith's ex-wife, Dawn Watson, was sentenced to a 3½-year jail term for soliciting to murder. "I was so terrified.

Duffy said in retrospect, "It was a horrendous thing to do." Her mother and her sisters did not speak to her for about a year afterwards. In reaction to her parents' break-up, her next three years were a rebellious period that included [[binge drinking]] and stealing a rowing boat.<ref name=IndependentPersonal>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/duffys-48hour-drinking-binge-2206970.html |title=Duffy's 48-hour drinking binge |work=[[The Independent]] |access-date=27 September 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105153256/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/duffys-48hour-drinking-binge-2206970.html |archive-date=5 January 2015}}</ref>

===Recovery===
On 25 February 2020, on her official website, Duffy wrote that she had been "raped and drugged and held hostage over some days". She said she had disappeared from the spotlight so she could recover, adding that she was now doing well, but it had taken her time to recover.<ref>{{Cite web|title=@duffy on Instagram: "You can only imagine the amount of times I thought about writing this.

In a longer statement published that April, Duffy wrote that she had been drugged at a restaurant on her birthday, taken to a foreign country on a plane, and was then held captive in a hotel room and repeatedly raped over a period of four weeks. Since the ordeal, Duffy said that she spent "almost 10 years completely alone" and, thanking her psychologist, said that she now felt she could "leave this decade behind", but added: "I very much doubt I will ever be the person people once knew".<ref>{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Youngs |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52177265 |title=Duffy: Singer was 'drugged for four weeks, raped and taken abroad' |website=[[BBC News Online]] |date=5 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |access-date=6 April 2020 |title=Duffy reveals rape ordeal to 'help others who have suffered the same' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/06/duffy-reveals-ordeal-to-help-others-who-have-suffered-the-same |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=5 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://deadline.com/2020/07/singer-duffy-writes-reed-hastings-netflix-controversial-polish-film-365-days-glamorizes-rape-1202976002/ |title=Singer Duffy Writes To Reed Hastings Asking Netflix To Take Down Controversial Polish Film ''365 Days'': 'It Glamorizes Rape' |first=Tom |last=Grater |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=2 July 2020 |access-date=13 July 2020 }}</ref>
