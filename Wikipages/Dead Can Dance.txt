'''Dead Can Dance''' is an Australian music duo from [[Melbourne]]. Currently composed of [[Lisa Gerrard]] and [[Brendan Perry]], the group formed in 1981. They relocated to London the following year. Australian music historian [[Ian McFarlane]] described Dead Can Dance's style as "constructed soundscapes of mesmerising grandeur and solemn beauty; [[Music of Africa|African]] [[polyrhythm]]s, [[Celtic music|Gaelic folk]], [[Gregorian chant]], [[Middle Eastern music]], [[mantra]]s, and [[art rock]]."<ref name="McF">{{cite book |last=McFarlane |first=Ian |author-link=Ian McFarlane |year=1999 |title=[[Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop]] |chapter=Encyclopedia entry for 'Dead Can Dance (DCD)' |chapter-url=http://www.whammo.com.au/encyclopedia.asp?articleid=261 |publisher=[[Allen & Unwin]] |location=[[St Leonards, New South Wales|St Leonards, NSW]] |isbn=1-86508-072-1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040628015739/http://www.whammo.com.au/encyclopedia.asp?articleid=261 |access-date=14 April 2013|archive-date=28 June 2004 }}</ref>

Having disbanded in 1998, they reunited briefly in 2005 for a world tour and reformed in 2011 when they released and toured a new album, ''[[Anastasis (album)|Anastasis]]''. They released a new album in 2018 called ''[[Dionysus (album)|Dionysus]]'' and are touring again as of mid-2019.

==Career==
===Formation and early years===
Dead Can Dance was formed in Melbourne, Australia, in August 1981 with Paul Erikson on bass guitar, [[Lisa Gerrard]] (ex-Microfilm) on vocals and percussion, Simon Monroe ([[The Scavengers|Marching Girls]]) on drums and [[Brendan Perry]] (also of Marching Girls) on vocals and guitar.<ref name="McF"/> Gerrard and Perry were a couple who met as members of Melbourne's [[Little Band scene]]. In May 1982, the band left Melbourne in Australia and moved to London, England, where they signed with alternative rock label 4AD.<ref>{{cite book |last=Strong |first=Martin C. |year=2000 |title=The Great Rock Discography |edition=5th |publisher=Mojo Books |location=[[Edinburgh]] |page=248 |isbn= 1-84195-017-3}}</ref> With the duo, the initial United Kingdom line-up were Paul Erikson and [[Peter Ulrich]].<ref name="McF"/>

The group's debut album, ''[[Dead Can Dance (album)|Dead Can Dance]]'', was released in February 1984.<ref name="ARDb">{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007163504/http://hem.passagen.se/honga/database/d/deadcandance.html |url=http://hem.passagen.se/honga/database/d/deadcandance.html |title=Dead Can Dance |last=Holmgren |first=Magnus |publisher=[[Australian Rock Database]].

The album featured "drum-driven, ambient guitar music with chanting, singing and howling",<ref name="McF"/> and fit in with the [[ethereal wave]] style of label mates [[Cocteau Twins]].

For their second album, ''[[Spleen and Ideal]]'', the group comprised the core duo of Gerrard and Perry with cello, trombone and [[tympani]] added in by session musicians.<ref name="McF"/> Released in November 1985, it was co-produced by the duo and John A.

Dead Can Dance's albums were not widely available until the early 1990s, when 4AD made a distribution deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]]. Later, 4AD allied itself with the [[Beggars Banquet Records|Beggars Banquet Records Group]], which included that eponymous label and XL Recordings in the US, but the band's recordings remained distributed through Warner Bros. Subsequent releases, however, were licensed to [[Rhino Entertainment Company|Rhino]]/[[Atlantic Records]], a sister label within [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music]]. Its 1991 compilation ''[[A Passage in Time (Dead Can Dance album)|A Passage in Time]]'' remains with 4AD independently of the Rhino and Warner Bros. deals; it was initially only released in the US.<ref name="AllMusic"/>

The duo's sixth studio album, ''[[Into the Labyrinth (Dead Can Dance album)|Into the Labyrinth]]'', was issued in September 1993 and dispensed with guest musicians entirely; it sold 500,000 copies worldwide and appeared in the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name="AllMusic charts">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dead-can-dance-mn0000225948/awards |title=Dead Can Dance – Awards |publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=14 April 2013}}</ref> The band became 4AD's highest-selling act.<ref name="McF"/> They followed with a world tour in 1994 and recorded a live performance in [[California]] which was released as ''[[Toward the Within]]'', with video versions on [[Laserdisc]] and [[VHS]] (later on DVD). Many unofficial bootlegs of concerts spanning its career exist, containing several rare songs that were only performed live. ''Toward the Within'' is the duo's first official [[live album]], which reached the ''Billboard'' 200 and was followed by ''[[In Concert (Dead Can Dance album)|In Concert]]'' 19 years later.<ref name="AllMusic charts"/> Gerrard released her debut solo recording, ''[[The Mirror Pool]]'', and reunited with Perry on the Dead Can Dance studio album ''[[Spiritchaser]]'' in 1996.<ref name="McF"/> The album also charted on ''Billboard'' 200 and reached No.&nbsp;1 on the Top World Music Albums Chart.<ref name="AllMusic charts"/>

===Disbandment and reunions===
In 1998, Dead Can Dance began recording a follow-up album to ''Spiritchaser'', which was due to be released in early 1999 followed by a planned world tour. However, they separated before it was completed and canceled the tour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/midevlman/dcdindex.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990428040746/http://members.aol.com/midevlman/dcdindex.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 April 1999|title=The Ultimate Dead Can Dance Page|date=28 April 1999}}</ref> One song from the recording sessions, "The Lotus Eaters", was eventually released on the box set ''[[Dead Can Dance (1981-1998)]]'' and on the two-disc compilation ''[[Wake (Dead Can Dance album)|Wake]]'' (2003). Gerrard teamed with [[Pieter Bourke]] ([[Snog]], Soma) to issue ''[[Duality (Lisa Gerrard and Pieter Bourke album)|Duality]]'' in April 1998. Perry released ''[[Eye of the Hunter]]'' in October 1999.<ref name="McF"/>

Dead Can Dance reunited in 2005 and released limited-edition recordings of thirteen shows from its European tour and eight recordings from the subsequent North American tour, as well as a compilation titled ''Selections from Europe 2005''. These concerts were recorded and released on The Show record label. In 2005, the song "Nierika" became part of the opening titles for Mexican television station TV [[Azteca (TV network)|Azteca]]'s soap opera ''La Chacala''.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Cecilia Gonzales |date=26 October 2012 |title=Nierika (La Chacala) - Dead Can Dance |medium=Television production |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRAOf_BgME0 |access-date=3 August 2020 |location=Mexico |via=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>
