== Biography ==
From a broken home, Saunders grew up being looked after by his extended family. By his teens, he became involved in local crime and in 2005 was incarcerated for eight months.<ref name="DOC" />{{dead link|date=August 2019}} After this, he became involved in music promotion and formed a group called Blood Money Union, which consisted of other DJs, producers and rappers.<ref name="Bio" />

Saunders' first success in rapping came with a self-released record called "Dirty Foot", which he wrote while still in high school<ref name="Bio" /> and distributed in the [[Tarpon Springs, Florida|Tarpon Springs]] area at the urging of his cousin. After hearing it played in a local dance club and then witnessing another rapper's performance, 2 Pistols had his first chance to perform on-stage. After taking the stage and performing his own single ("Dirty Foot"), 2 Pistols' confidence in his abilities grew to a point that he began to take his chances at making a career of music seriously.<ref name="Bio" />

His debut album, ''[[Death Before Dishonor (album)|Death Before Dishonor]]'', was released on June 17, 2008<ref name=":0">Listing at [http://www.billboard.com/artist/431860/2-pistols/chart Billboard.com], accessed October 15, 2014.</ref> and featured production from the [[Grammy]]-winning [[J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League]], Da Honorable C.N.O.T.E, Bolo Da Producer, and others.
