In [[geography]], an '''oasis''' ({{IPAc-en|oʊ|ˈ|eɪ|s|ɪ|s}}, plural '''oases''', {{IPAc-en|oʊ|ˈ|eɪ|s|iː|z}}) is a fertile land in a [[desert]] or semi-desert environment.<ref name=":1">{{in lang|fr}} [http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00004609 Battesti, Vincent (2005) Jardins au désert: Évolution des pratiques et savoirs oasiens: Jérid tunisien. Paris: IRD éditions.] {{ISBN|978-2-7177-2584-1}}.</ref> Oases also [[Oasis effect|provide habitats]] for animals and plants.

== Etymology ==
The word ''oasis'' came into English from {{lang-la|oasis}}, from {{lang-grc|ὄασις}}, {{lang|grc-Latn|óasis}}, which in turn is a direct borrowing from [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic Egyptian]]. The word for ''oasis'' in the latter-attested [[Coptic language]] (the descendant of Demotic Egyptian) is ''wahe'' or ''ouahe'' which means a "dwelling place".<ref name="OnlineEtymology">{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=oasis&searchmode=none|title=Etymonline - Origin of 'Oasis'|author=Douglas Harper|dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary|access-date=2011-07-30}}</ref>

== Description ==
Oases are made fertile when sources of freshwater, such as underground rivers or [[aquifer]]s, irrigate the surface naturally or via man-made wells.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/oasis/|title=oasis|date=2011-06-10|work=National Geographic Society|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en}}</ref> 
The presence of water on the surface or underground is necessary and the local or regional management of this essential resource is strategic, but not sufficient to create such areas: continuous human work and know-how (a technical and social culture) are essential to maintain such ecosystems.<ref name=":2">[http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00569337 Vincent Battesti, The Power of a Disappearance: Water in the Jerid region of Tunisia ''in'' B.

Rain showers provide subterranean water to sustain natural oases, such as the [[Tuat]]. Substrata of impermeable rock and stone can trap water and retain it in pockets, or on long faulting subsurface ridges or volcanic dikes water can collect and percolate to the surface. Any incidence of water is then used by [[migrating bird]]s, which also pass seeds with their droppings which will grow at the water's edge forming an oasis. It can also be used to plant crops.

== Historical significance ==
{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}
The location of oases has been of critical importance for trade and transportation routes in desert areas; caravans must travel via oases so that supplies of water and food can be replenished. Thus, political or military control of an oasis has in many cases meant control of trade on a particular route. For example, the oases of [[Awjila]], [[Ghadames]] and [[Kufra]], situated in modern-day [[Libya]], have at various times been vital to both north–south and east–west [[Trans-Saharan trade|trade in the Sahara Desert]]. The [[Silk Road]] across Central Asia also incorporated several oases.

In [[North American]] history, oases have been less prominent because the desert regions are smaller; however, several areas in the deep [[southwestern United States]] have oases regions that served as important links through the hot deserts and vast rural areas. While present-day desert cities like [[Las Vegas]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Palm Springs]], and [[Tucson]] are large modern cities, many of these locations were once small, isolated farming areas at which travelers through the western desert stopped for food and supplies. Even today, there are several roads that go through western deserts like [[U.S. Route 50]] through southern [[Nevada]], and the [[Mojave Desert]] that feature small green fields, citrus groves and small isolated supply towns.

== Growing plants ==
People who live in an oasis must manage land and water use carefully; fields must be irrigated to grow [[plant]]s like [[apricot]]s, [[Date palm|dates]], [[Common fig|figs]], and [[olive]]s. The most important plant in an oasis is the date palm, which forms the upper layer. These palm trees provide shade for smaller trees like [[peach]] trees, which form the middle layer. By growing plants in different layers, the farmers make best use of the soil and water. Many vegetables are also grown and some cereals, such as [[barley]], [[millet]], and [[wheat]], are grown where there is more moisture.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/oasis-geological-feature|title=Oasis {{!}} geological feature|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en}}</ref>
In summary, an oasis palm grove is a highly anthropized and irrigated area that supports a traditionally intensive and polyculture-based agriculture.<ref name=":1" /> The oasis is integrated into its desert environment through an often close association with nomadic [[transhumant]] livestock farming (very often pastoral and sedentary populations are clearly distinguished). However, the oasis is emancipated from the desert by a very particular social and [[ecosystem]] structure. Responding to environmental constraints, it is an integrated agriculture that is conducted with the superposition (in its typical form) of two or three strata creating what is called the "oasis effect":<ref name=":1" />
* the first and highest stratum is made up of date palms ([[date palm|''Phoenix dactylifera'' L.]]) and maintains freshness;
* an intermediate stratum includes fruit trees (orange, banana, pomegranate, apple, etc.);
* the third stratum, in the shade, of herbaceous plants (market gardening, fodder, cereals).
