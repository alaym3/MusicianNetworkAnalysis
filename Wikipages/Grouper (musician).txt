Grouper released the critically acclaimed ''[[Dragging a Dead Deer Up a Hill]]'' in 2008, followed by five more records, including a two-part album, ''A I A'', and the piano-led album ''[[Ruins (Grouper album)|Ruins]]''. Her eleventh album, ''[[Grid of Points]]'', was released in 2018, with her twelfth album, Shade, releasing in 2021.

Grouper has collaborated with a number of other artists, including [[Xiu Xiu]], [[Tiny Vipers]] ([[Mirrorring]]), [[Roy Montgomery]], [[Kevin Martin (British musician)|The Bug]], [[Lawrence English]] (Slow Walkers), and [[Jefre Cantu-Ledesma]] (Raum).

==History==
Harris was born July 15, 1980 in Northern California and grew up around the [[San Francisco Bay area]].<ref name="dazed">{{cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/15507/1/grouper|work=Dazed|title=Grouper|date=2013|author=Myers, Owen|access-date=2014-09-08}}</ref>
She grew up in a [[Fourth Way]] commune there which was inspired by the philosophy of [[George Gurdjieff]]. The community was known as "The Group", which would later serve as some inspiration for the moniker Grouper. According to Harris, the kids called each other and the parents 'groupers' sort of as a defiance. She says: "It was us making our own identities inside a pretty controlled environment, and sort of lashing back maybe... When I had to think of a name I felt annoyed at nothing sounding right. I wanted something that referenced me without referencing 'Me.'" According to her, she "felt like the music was at its barest just a grouping of sounds, and I was just the grouper."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Clarke|first1=Cary|title=Our Town Could Be Your Life|url=http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/our-town-could-be-your-life/Content?oid=837156|website=The Portland Mercure|access-date=24 March 2016}}</ref>

After finishing college, Harris briefly moved to [[Los Angeles]], where she worked with [[Mayo Thompson]] at Patrick Painter.<ref>{{cite web|title=Listening & Playing Alone: The Strange World Of Grouper|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/16614-grouper-liz-harris-discography|website=The Quietus|access-date=23 March 2016}}</ref> Harris is now based in Oregon. Harris’ first album was [[2005 in music|2005]]’s ''Grouper'', a self-released full-length [[CD-R]], followed later that year by ''Way Their Crept'' on Free Porcupine (re-released in 2007 on Type Records). In [[2006 in music|2006]] she released a single (''He Knows''), one album, called ''Wide'', and a collaboration with [[Xiu Xiu]] entitled ''Creepshow''. Harris made available new material steadily through the years, and continued to collaborate with various artists such as [[Roy Montgomery]] and [[Xela (musician)|Xela]].

In 2008 she released ''[[Dragging a Dead Deer Up a Hill]]''. An [[AllMusic]] reviewer Heather Phares praised the album for showing more musical range than Harris' previous work and for "letting more melody, more structured songs, and even a few phrases emerge from the ether."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Phares|first1=Heather|title=AllMusic Review by Heather Phares|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/dragging-a-dead-deer-up-a-hill|website=AllMusic|access-date=24 March 2016}}</ref> [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] gave it 8.2 stars calling the work "an arresting album of pastoral psychedelic pop".<ref name="Dragging a Dead Deer Up a Hill">{{cite web|last1=McGonigal|first1=Mike|title=Dragging a Dead Deer Up a Hill|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12119-dragging-a-dead-deer-up-a-hill/|website=Pitchfork|access-date=24 March 2016}}</ref>

In 2011, Grouper released an album consisting of two parts: ''[[A I A: Dream Loss]]'' and ''[[A I A: Alien Observer]]'', which was critically acclaimed by [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]], while the latter part was noted for being more accessible of the two discs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Richardson|first1=Mark|title=A I A: Alien Observer|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15332-a-i-a-alien-observer-a-i-a-dream-loss/|website=Pitchfork|access-date=23 March 2016}}</ref>

Early in 2012, Grouper performed ''Violet Replacement'' in the UK and Europe, a pair of longform tape collage pieces which originally took shape for commissioned performances in New York and Berkeley. Besides, she collaborated with Jesy Fortino of [[Tiny Vipers]] to release an album ''[[Foreign Body (album)|Foreign Body]]'' under their common moniker [[Mirrorring]].

At Berlin's Club Transmediale festival in early February 2012 Harris performed ''Circular Veil'' in collaboration with [[Jefre Cantu-Ledesma]].<ref name="dazed" /> Somewhere between an installation and a performance, it found her extending her more concise music outward into eight hours of music, designed to mimic one full [[sleep cycle]].

In 2013, Harris released an album, ''[[The Man Who Died in His Boat]]''.

Grouper's studio album titled ''[[Ruins (Grouper album)|Ruins]]'' was released on October 31, 2014.  The album is relatively stripped-down; piano, voice and field recordings.<ref>{{cite web|last1=True|first1=Chris|title=Biography by Chris True|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/grouper-mn0000274272/biography|website=AllMusic|access-date=25 March 2016}}</ref> The majority of the album was recorded in [[Aljezur|Aljezur, Portugal]] in 2011, while Harris was on a residency set up by Galeria Zé dos Bois.<ref name="ruins">{{Cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/56318-grouper-announces-new-album-ruins/|work=Pitchfork|title=Grouper Announces New Album Ruins|author=Gordon, Jeremy|date=2014-08-14|access-date=2014-09-08}}</ref> That same year she appeared on [[Kevin Martin (British musician)|The Bug's]] [[Angels & Devils (The Bug album)|album]] providing vocals for the track "Void".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kalev|first1=Maya|title=Grouper On Her New Album: "Ruins Helped Crack Me Open."|url=http://www.thefader.com/2014/10/31/grouper-interview-ruins|website=The Fader|access-date=23 March 2016}}</ref>

In 2015, Grouper collaborated with an independent filmmaker [[Paul Clipson]] on the film ''Hypnosis Display'', commissioned by Leeds Opera North.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview: Grouper and Paul Clipson discuss 'Hypnosis Display'|url=http://ww2.kqed.org/arts/2015/04/07/interview-grouper-and-paul-clipson-discuss-hypnosis-display/|website=KQED Arts|access-date=23 March 2016}}</ref>

In 2016, Grouper released a 7" entitled '' 'Paradise Valley'.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bowe|first1=Miles|title=Grouper releases surprise 7" Paradise Valley|url=http://www.factmag.com/2016/12/21/grouper-paradise-valley-headache-im-clean-now-single/|website=Factmag|access-date=22 December 2016}}</ref>

In 2017, Grouper was one of the curators for the 11th edition of the Dutch [[Le Guess Who?]] festival.

==Musical style==
During her days as a part of a Fourth Way commune, Harris' primary sources for discovering music were limited. With a little help from her parents, whose musical tastes were eccentric and divergent, she discovered [[Eastern Europe|Eastern European folk]] and American avant-pop. Through her father, who himself was a composer, she would later discover [[Contemporary classical music|contemporary classical]] and [[early music]].<ref name="Our Town Could Be Your Life">{{cite web|last1=Clarke|first1=Cary|title=Our Town Could Be Your Life|url=http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/our-town-could-be-your-life/Content?oid=837156|website=The Portland Mercury|access-date=24 March 2016}}</ref> In 2008, when she released ''[[Dragging a Dead Deer Up a Hill]]'', Pitchfork compared it to classic [[Ethereal wave|ethereal]] releases from the British label [[4AD]], drawing comparisons to [[Cocteau Twins]]<ref name="Dragging a Dead Deer Up a Hill"/> and early [[His Name Is Alive]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Phares|first1=Heather|title=AllMusic Review by Heather Phares|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/dragging-a-dead-deer-up-a-hill-mw0001233331|website=AllMusic}}</ref> [[The Portland Mercury]] described some songs from the album, such as "Wind and Snow" and "Stuck", sonically reminiscent of the [[Renaissance]] period composers [[Carlo Gesualdo|Gesualdo]] and [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]].<ref name="Our Town Could Be Your Life"/>
