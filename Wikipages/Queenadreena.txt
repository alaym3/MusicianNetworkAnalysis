'''Queenadreena''' was an [[British rock music|English]] [[alternative rock]] band that formed in London, England in 1999 by vocalist [[KatieJane Garside]] and guitarist [[Crispin Gray]], who had previously collaborated in the celebrated but short-lived band [[Daisy Chainsaw]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/queenadreena-mn0000329446/biography|work=Allmusic|title=QueenAdreena|access-date=16 October 2013}}</ref> Garside and Gray, who had earned a reputation for their abrasive songwriting with Daisy Chainsaw, incorporated elements of [[blues rock]] and other genres with Queenadreena, in addition to their predominant [[noise rock]] influences.<ref name=djin>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/djin-mw0001261491|work=Allmusic|title=Djin - QueenAdreena|access-date=22 September 2016|author=Severa, Alan|date=8 October 2008}}</ref>

The band released four studio albums between 2000 and 2008, beginning with the critically acclaimed ''[[Taxidermy (Queenadreena album)|Taxidermy]]'' (2000). The band signed with [[Rough Trade Records]] for their second release, ''[[Drink Me (Queenadreena album)|Drink Me]]'' (2002), before being dropped by the label, after which they signed with the independent label [[One Little Indian Records|One Little Indian]]. The band also released a live album, ''[[Live at the ICA]]'', which was recorded at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]]. In 2010, the group disbanded and Garside pursued other solo projects, namely [[Ruby Throat]].

==History==
===Formation, ''Taxidermy'': 1999–2001===
Queenadreena formed in 1999 after guitarist Crispin Gray came in contact with KatieJane Garside, with whom he had collaborated with in 1989 when they formed the band [[Daisy Chainsaw]].<ref name=larkin>{{cite book|author=Larkin, Colin|title=The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music|page=111|year=2000|publisher=Virgin|isbn=978-0-753-50427-7}}</ref> Garside left Daisy Chainsaw after completing two years with the band, and went into seclusion in the [[Lake District]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundspheremag.com/features/legend-of-the-scene-katiejane-garside/|work=Sound Sphere Magazine|title=Five Minutes With... KatieJane Garside|date=8 September 2006|access-date=22 September 2016}}</ref> where she lived in the historic [[Rigg Beck]], a retreat for artists and bohemians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/news/1.132920|title=Landmark Lakes House Destroyed By Fire Was 'Home' To Stars|publisher=Newsandstar.co.uk|access-date=5 September 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016170103/http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/news/1.132920|archive-date=16 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/feb/26/artsfeatures1|title=A way with the fairies|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=16 October 2013|date=25 February 2000|author=O'Brien, Lucy}}</ref> Returning to London in 1998, Garside moved to [[Belsize Park]], where Gray had also been living, and the two reconnected to form the group.<Ref name=rd/>

Garside said the band name came from when she was writing in Wales: “She just arrived in my head. She came in as Princess Adreena, and I had to write her story. She'd been a warrior princess who'd cut off her left breast for better use of bow and arrow, stuff like that. That's where she came from and then we crowned her, made her into Queen Adreena.”<ref>https://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4562-i-want-to-have-a-past</ref>

Gray and Garside were joined by drummer Billy Freedom and bassist Orson Wajih<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/queenadreena/biography/|work=MTV|title=Queenadreena Biography|access-date=22 September 2016}}</ref> and released their first album, ''[[Taxidermy (Queenadreena album)|Taxidermy]]'', in early 2000, on the Blanco y Negro Records imprint. Some of the material featured on the album, namely the track "X-ing Off the Days," was written solely by Gray in the years following the breakup of Daisy Chainsaw.<ref name=rd/> ''[[NME]]'' gave the album a positive review, writing: "While carrying on Daisy Chainsaw's predilection for rock as infantile nightmare, here the scope is much wider than a one-track take on banshee pop. There are some obvious precedents, notably [[Björk]] and [[PJ Harvey]], but much more than either of those two reference points, this debut album is frequently akin to eavesdropping on psychotherapy."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/2087#tdRqjHZRug1oBB2F.99|work=NME|title=Taxidermy|access-date=22 September 2016}}</ref> 

To support the record, the band toured nationally supporting [[Nine Inch Nails]],<ref name=rd/> as well as performances at the 2000 [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.readingfestival.com/history/reading-festival-2000|work=Reading Festival|title=Reading Festival 2000|access-date=20 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917204918/http://www.readingfestival.com/history/reading-festival-2000|archive-date=17 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> After its release, the band's name was changed slightly, from "Queen Adreena" to "QueenAdreena", and subsequent releases reflect this.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4562|work=Drowned In Sound|title=I want to have a past|date=2 August 2002|access-date=16 October 2013|author=Cameron, Liane|archive-date=16 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016082958/http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4562|url-status=dead}}</ref> During this time, the band released a split single, featuring a cover of [[Dolly Parton]]'s "[[Jolene (song)|Jolene]]," and "Pretty Polly."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adequacy.net/2010/06/interview-with-ruby-throat/|work=Delusions of Adequacy|title=Interview with Ruby Throat|date=9 June 2010|author=Dan, Jen|access-date=20 September 2016}}</ref>

===Label shifts: 2002–06===
[[File:Queen Adreena Dublin Castle.jpg|thumb|right|Garside performing with Queenadreena, Dublin, 2006]]
Billy Freedom was replaced in 2002 by drummer [[Pete Howard]], formerly of [[The Clash]]. The band signed with [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]] for their second album, 2002's ''[[Drink Me (Queenadreena album)|Drink Me]]''.{{Sfn|Young|2006|p=184}} The record spawned the single "[[Pretty Like Drugs]]," which garnered the band attention from rock press. The album was well received by such publications as ''[[Drowned in Sound]]'', who gave it a 7/10 rating, writing: "KatieJane Garside is the kind of woman who makes ordinarily rational grown guys go weak at the knees. "Pretty Like Drugs" will show you why. As her cutesy lost girl [[Tori Amos]]/Björk-isms erupt into fearsome hollers that would have piss dribbling down [[Courtney Love]]’s surgically enhanced thighs, it’ll all make sense."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drownedinsound.com/releases/3064/reviews/4840-|title=Album Review: Queen Adreena - Drink Me|date=2002|access-date=21 September 2016|author=Anonymous, Adam|archive-date=22 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422112537/http://drownedinsound.com/releases/3064/reviews/4840-|url-status=dead}}</ref> The French publication ''Les inrockuptibles'' described the record as "Gothic, dark, and threatening."<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Les Inrockuptibles |volume= 385–9 |pages= 42–3 |year=2003 |publisher= Editions Indépendantes |title= Queenadreena}}</ref>

Rough Trade dropped the group shortly after the release of ''Drink Me'', and Wajih left the band while they embarked on a tour supporting [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]].<ref name=rd>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/uk/queen+adreena|work=Rock Detector|title=MusicMight :: Artists :: QUEENADREENA|date=2009|access-date=23 September 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404201159/http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/uk/queen+adreena|archive-date=4 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Janie Jarvis, formerly of [[Radiator (band)|Radiator]], joined the band as a temporary bassist for their tour, before former Daisy Chainsaw bassist Richard Adams joined the group.<ref name=rd/> Adams shortly after left the band, and they appeared at the Castle Donington [[Download Festival]] in 2003.<ref name=rd/>

The band signed with [[One Little Indian Records]] in 2004, and released ''[[The Butcher and the Butterfly]]'' with KatieJane's sister Melanie Garside on bass, who left soon after and was replaced by Paul Jackson (not to be confused with the [[Paul Jackson (bassist)|fusion bassist]] of the same name). On March 22, 2005, the band recorded a live album at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in London. The album was released in September as ''[[Live at the ICA]]''.

===''Djin'' and dissolution: 2007–Current===
In 2007, Queenadreena independently released ''[[Ride a Cock Horse (album)|Ride a Cock Horse]]'', an album composed of early demos. Further line-up changes saw [[The Dogbones|Nomi Leonard]] becoming the new bass player and, in the latter half of 2008, Pete Howard being replaced on drums by [[Stephen Gilchrist]].

On 8 October 2008 Queenadreena released their fourth studio album, ''[[Djin (album)|Djin]]'', initially only in Japan through [[Teichiku Records|Imperial Records]]. The album eventually saw a release in the United Kingdom September 2009, but was not actively promoted by the band which, by then, was effectively on hiatus. Incorporating influences of blues rock more heavily than the band's early releases did, ''[[Allmusic]]'' called the record "[Queenadreena's] masterpiece, balancing all their characteristically mercurial elements on the solid basis of the mastery of an accomplished band, which was left by the media to grow at its own pace."<ref name=djin/>

In 2011, Crispin Gray stated, "I wouldn't rule out some kind of reunion gigs in the future. I don't think there will be another record from Queenadreena though, I would be very surprised myself. I haven't heard from Katie in well over a year and I don’t know where she is."

In a 2020 interview on [[Conan Neutron’s Protonic Reversal]] Garside, who released an album under the name Liar, Flower, expressed extreme skepticism about working with Gray in the future or further Queenadreena material including her contributions. <ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-06-24|title=Ep181: KatieJane Garside (Daisy Chainsaw, Liar,Flower, Queen Adreena)|url=https://www.radioneutron.com/2020/06/24/ep181-katiejane-garside-daisy-chainsaw-liarflower-queen-adreena/|access-date=2020-06-24|website=Conan Neutron's Protonic Reversal|language=en-US}}</ref>

Their final studio album ''Djin'' was re-released in a limited edition, gatefold double neon pink vinyl set by Cadiz Entertainment on 16 April 2021.  The reissue included six additional new demo tracks and a previously unheard song “Heaven Doesn't Wait,” co-written and recorded with the late [[Andy Gill]] from [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.viveleshop.com/collections/all/products/queen-adreena-djin-limited-edition-neon-pink-2lp-vinyl-cd-released-april-16th|title=Queen Adreena - Djin - Limited Edition Neon Pink 2LP Vinyl / CD}}</ref>
