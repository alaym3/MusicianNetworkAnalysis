==Artistry==
In ''[[Jeune Afrique]]'', Eva Sauphie described Lenae as a "cross between [[Kelela]], an [[Azealia Banks]] dipped in honey and a [[Teen Spirit (deodorant)|teen spirit]] version [[Kelis]]," combining genres including "[[nu soul]], elecro-jazz, [[chamber pop]], and ambient hip-hop."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sauphie|first1=Eva|title=Musique : Ravyn Lenae, la nouvelle Kelis|url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/361270/culture/musique-ravyn-lenae-nouvelle-kelis/|accessdate=November 17, 2017|work=Jeune Afrique|date=September 29, 2016|language=fr-FR}}</ref> The ''[[Austin American-Statesman]]'' described her style as "a watercolor R&B platter with startling depth."<ref name="States">{{cite news|last1=Stith|first1=Deborah Sengupta|title=SXSW 2017: 11 soul and blues acts to catch|url=http://www.mystatesman.com/entertainment/music/sxsw-2017-soul-and-blues-acts-catch/p57iDsSyh5U7CZvwTo8oTI/|accessdate=November 17, 2017|work=Austin American-Statesman|date=March 7, 2017}}</ref> Lenae has mentioned [[OutKast]], [[Timbaland]], [[Eminem]], [[India.Arie]], and [[Erykah Badu]] among her musical influences.<ref name="PitchZero"/> Writing for ''[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]'', Ryan Dombal reviewed Lenae's performance on Monte Booker's "Baby" as "channel[ing] both [[Billie Holiday|Billie]] [Holiday] and [[Erykah Badu|Erykah]] [Badu] on the acoustic-guitar ballad, which crackles like [[Lauryn Hill]]’s ''[[Lauryn Hill discography|Unplugged]]'' as remixed by the ghost of [[J Dilla]]."<ref name="PitchBooker"/>

Comparing Lenae's two EPs, Mosi Reeves of ''Rolling Stone'' said ''Midnight Moonlight'' "delves into more romantic concerns with the same quiet grace" first heard on ''Moon Shoes'' in which she "sings about life as a dreamy, sometimes-melancholy teenager in a softly assertive voice."<ref name="RS10"/> Marcus J. Moore's ''Pitchfork'' review of ''Midnight Moonlight'' noted that it "carries a methodical late-night vibe suitable for Quiet Storm radio" particularly when compared to the "far brighter" energy on ''Moon Shoes''.<ref name="PitchMidnight">{{cite news|last1=Moore|first1=Marcus J.|title=Ravyn Lenae – Midnight Moonlight EP|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23183-midnight-moonlight-ep/|date=April 25, 2017|accessdate=November 17, 2017|work=Pitchfork}}</ref>
