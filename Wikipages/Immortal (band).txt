'''Immortal''' is a Norwegian [[black metal]] band from [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]]. The group was founded in 1991 by frontman and guitarist [[Olve Eikemo|Abbath Doom Occulta]] (Olve Eikemo) and guitarist [[Harald Nævdal|Demonaz Doom Occulta]] (Harald Nævdal). The pair worked with various drummers (including Grim, Armagedda and [[Jan Axel Blomberg|Hellhammer]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.immortalofficial.com/blog/?page_id=184 |title=Immortal Official Web Site: Band |website=Immortalofficial.com |access-date=10 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68sW316qP?url=http://www.immortalofficial.com/blog/?page_id=184 |archive-date=3 July 2012 }}</ref> and were later joined by current drummer [[Reidar Horghagen|Horgh]] (Reidar Horghagen) in 1996.

In March 2015, long-serving member Abbath announced his departure from the group following a dispute with the other members of the band, and he went on to form a new band under his name called [[Abbath (band)|Abbath]].<ref name="blabbermouth"/> It was initially reported that following Abbath's departure, the band would split up. However, In August 2015, Demonaz and Horgh said that the band would continue without Abbath.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/abbath-less-immortal-begins-work-on-new-material-we-will-continue-what-we-believe-in/ | title=ABBATH-Less IMMORTAL Begins Work On New Material: 'We Will Continue What We Believe In' | work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] | date=12 August 2015 | access-date=12 August 2015}}</ref><ref name="MH20150813">{{cite web | url=http://metalhammer.teamrock.com/news/2015-08-13/immortal-move-on-without-abbath | title=Immortal move on without Abbath | last1=Munro |first1=Scott | date=13 August 2015 | access-date=13 August 2015| publisher=Team Rock Limited | quote=Immortal is much more than just a band, and much more {{sic|then}} just a form of music.

''[[Northern Chaos Gods]]'' was officially released on 6 July 2018 under [[Nuclear Blast|Nuclear Blast Records]]. Although the band has been a trio for most of its history, several albums have been recorded as a duo, with varying combinations of Abbath, Demonaz, and Horgh.

==History==
===First three albums (1991–1996)===
Immortal arose from two short-lived bands, [[Old Funeral]] and Amputation, which were formed by Abbath and others in 1988. Immortal's original lineup consisted of ex-members from both of these bands. Old Funeral was founded by Abbath and Tore (Tore Bratseth), then went through a string of guitarists (including Demonaz, [[Varg Vikernes]] and [[Jørn Inge Tunsberg]]) until disbanding in 1992. Abbath, Demonaz, and Jørn formed Amputation, which released two demos with Demonaz on guitar and vocals, Jørn on guitars, and Padden on drums, before disbanding in 1990.

Members of Old Funeral and Amputation formed Immortal in 1991,<ref name=Allmusic/> with Abbath on bass and lead vocals, Demonaz on guitar, and Armagedda on drums. The music on their early demo recordings was [[death metal]],<ref name=loc39>[[Michael Moynihan (journalist)|Michael Moynihan]], Didrik Søderlind: ''[[Lords of Chaos (book)|Lords of Chaos]]'', First Edition, Feral House 1998, p. 39.</ref> with lyrics influenced by [[Morbid Angel]] and [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]].<ref name=thebrothersgrim01>Brad Angle: [http://www.guitarworld.com/immortal-brothers-grim?page=0,1 ''Immortal: The Brothers Grim'']. In: ''[[Guitar World]]''. 2007.</ref> The band then became influenced by [[Euronymous]]<ref name=loc39/> and bands like [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] and [[Celtic Frost]].<ref name=thebrothersgrim01/> They released their [[Immortal (Immortal EP)|self-titled EP]] in 1991, which saw a stylistic change to black metal. This was followed by their debut album ''[[Diabolical Fullmoon Mysticism]]'' in 1992. Immortal's early full-length releases were in traditional black metal style, but their most acclaimed album, ''[[At the Heart of Winter]]'', marks the period when the band began to experiment with a complex fusion of black metal and [[Teutonic thrash metal|German thrash metal]],<ref name=thrash>{{cite web|author=John Serba |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/at-the-heart-of-winter-mw0000056436 |title=At the Heart of Winter - Immortal &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=7 December 1999 |access-date=29 November 2016}}</ref> resulting in the sound of Immortal's later works.

In 1995, the band released two video clips directed by British artist David Palser, entitled ''Masters of Nebulah Frost'', through [[Osmose Productions]]. They featured many bizarrely-shot images of frozen landscapes and vast forests with the band performing two songs from the album ''[[Battles in the North]]'', "Grim and Frostbitten Kingdoms" and "Blashyrkh (Mighty Ravendark)", on a Norwegian mountainside. The video for "Grim and Frostbitten Kingdoms" features [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]] drummer, [[Jan Axel Blomberg|Hellhammer]] (Jan Axel Blomberg). These clips have become the template for many other bands producing such works, similarly to how "The Call of the Wintermoon" is also highly influential.

===''Blizzard Beasts'' and ''At the Heart of Winter'' (1996–1999)===

Apart from the two core members, Abbath and Demonaz, Immortal did not find a stable lineup until 1996, when drummer Horgh joined the band and is credited on their album, ''[[Blizzard Beasts]]''. A major turning point for the band was in 1997 when Demonaz suffered acute [[tendinitis]] in his arm and was unable to continue playing, and Abbath took over for guitar. Despite this, Demonaz continued writing lyrics and has been a manager for the band, accompanying them on tour, releasing updates and giving interviews about how things are progressing with the band. Abbath and Horgh wrote and recorded the band's next album, ''At the Heart of Winter''. During the tours for this album, the band recruited Iscariah to stand in for bass duties, and made him a full-time member.

Grim committed suicide in 1999; however, it is said that this was unrelated to his departure from Immortal. The band frequently headlines (as recently as 2007) a festival held in his memory, the [[Hole in the Sky]] Festival.

===''Damned in Black'' and ''Sons of Northern Darkness'' (2000–2003)===
The next album, ''[[Damned in Black]]'' was more similar to their old style. It was well received, but is frequently overlooked as it came between two of their classic albums, ''At the Heart of Winter'' and ''[[Sons of Northern Darkness]]''. In 2000, the EP ''Immortal'' was repackaged as part of the ''True Kings of Norway'' compilation by [[Spinefarm Records]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spirit-of-metal.com/en/album/True_Kings_of_Norway/5652|title=Immortal : True Kings of Norway}}</ref> Also in 2000, Immortal signed a record contract with German label [[Nuclear Blast]]; this change to a more prominent record company didn't affect their style, a fact proven by their record ''Sons of Northern Darkness''. Two months after this, Iscariah announced his intention to leave the band and was replaced by Saroth for the next few months.

=== Split (2003–2007) ===
Immortal decided to split during the summer of 2003 for various personal reasons of the band members. However, in mid-October 2005, Abbath, Demonaz, and original Immortal drummer Armagedda reunited, and along with [[Gorgoroth]] bassist [[King ov Hell]] and [[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]] guitarist [[Arve Isdal|Ice Dale]] (Arve Isdal), they began work on a new project, dubbed [[I (band)|I]]. This new band entered the studio at the end of April 2006 to record their debut album, ''[[Between Two Worlds (I album)|Between Two Worlds]]'', released in November 2006. Demonaz also features as lyricist for the band.

In early June 2006, German magazine ''[[Rock Hard (magazine)|Rock Hard]]'' reported that Abbath, Demonaz and Horgh had decided to resurrect Immortal and start touring again in 2007. Abbath is quoted as saying:

{{cquote|I didn't really want to say it, but I don't give a shit. We will come back, stronger than ever. I've met with Horgh for the first time in over a year. He's built his new house here, right around the corner. In the next few days we will begin to rehearse our old 'Blizzard Beasts' classics. I'm already really hot on the idea. Immortal are timeless frost. One year more or less doesn't make a difference. We have all the time in the world.}}

=== Reunion and ''All Shall Fall'' (2007–2014) ===
In 2007, Immortal reunited for a string of summer shows. They headlined the [[Inferno Festival]] in April, the [[Tuska Open Air]] festival in June/July, [[Metal Camp]] festival in July, and the [[Wacken Open Air]] festival in August. They also performed twice in the United States in July 2007. Filling in as bassist for these dates was [[Aura Noir]] bassist [[Ole Moe|Apollyon]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=59518|title=Reunited Immortal to Headline Norway's Inferno Festival|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=1 October 2006|access-date=1 October 2006}}</ref> Immortal first toured Australia and New Zealand in March 2008.

[[File:Immortal in 2010.jpg|thumb|right|Immortal in 2010]]

After the reunion, Abbath and Horgh decided to reform the band on a permanent basis. This was confirmed by Demonaz in an interview with Eternal Terror.<ref>[http://www.bravewords.com/news/67554 "Immortal Rehearsing Songs for New Studio Album"]. [[Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles|BW&BK]]. 6 June 2007. Retrieved 2012-01-05.</ref> Apollyon was the permanent replacement for Iscariah, and the three began working with Demonaz on material for their next album ''[[All Shall Fall]]''. ''All Shall Fall'' was recorded in April–May 2009, and was released on 25 September 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Album Release Date |url=http://www.immortalofficial.com/oldnews.html |access-date=3 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628045255/http://www.immortalofficial.com/oldnews.html |archive-date=28 June 2009 }}</ref>

According to [[Decibel (magazine)|''Decibel'' magazine]]'s interview, work had begun on Immortal's ninth album stating in the article "four new songs already in the works for a follow-up to ''All Shall Fall''".<ref name="Decibel 2009">{{cite web|url=http://www.decibelmagazine.com/Content.aspx?ncid=329345|title=Immortal Interview, Decibel magazine, October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914035503/http://www.decibelmagazine.com/Content.aspx?ncid=329345|archive-date=14 September 2009}}</ref>

Abbath and Demonaz were interviewed in the 2009 American documentary by Aaron Aites and Audrey Ewell, ''[[Until the Light Takes Us]]''.

=== Legal battle, Abbath exit and ''Northern Chaos Gods'' (2014–present) ===
The members of Immortal were involved in a legal battle with each other over the rights to the Immortal trademark.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/immortal-members-involved-in-legal-battle-over-rights-to-band-name/ |title=Immortal Members Embroiled In Legal Battle Over Rights To Band Name |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=11 December 2014 |access-date=29 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Pål Nordseth |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2014/12/11/kultur/musikk/black_metal/immortal/metal/36641302/ |title=De er et av verdens største black metal-band. Nå krangler de om rettighetene til logoen - kultur |website=Dagbladet.no |date=11 December 2014 |access-date=29 November 2016}}</ref> They were also due to submit a new album to the [[Nuclear Blast]] label, though little information regarding the album and its release had been disclosed. It is confirmed, however, by Abbath that the album had been completed with the aid of various musicians.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABBATH: I Thought DEMONAZ And HORGH Quit IMMORTAL|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/abbath-i-thought-demonaz-and-horgh-quit-immortal/|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=23 December 2014}}</ref>

In March 2015, Abbath left Immortal as a result of this conflict and an inability to move forward. Abbath has continued to record and perform as a solo act under his name.<ref name="blabbermouth">{{cite news | url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/abbath-puts-immortal-to-rest-launches-new-band/ | title=Abbath Puts Immortal To Rest, Launches New Band | work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] | date=26 March 2015 | access-date=26 March 2015}}</ref>

On 8 January 2018, the band posted via [[Facebook]] an update on Immortal's upcoming ninth full-length, stating "We have put a massive amount of energy into this, and wanted to deliver our absolutely best.
It has been a pleasure to finish the studio process and most of all being stoked about the final result. [[Peter Tägtgren]] has done an outstanding job in producing and mixing it. We now look forward to have it released, and are excited to share our 9th full length with you all."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.facebook.com/immortalofficial/photos/a.442873947317.234252.7973092317/10156123295147318/?type=3&theater|title=IMMORTAL HAS COMPLETED NEW ALBUM!|publisher=Immortal|date=8 January 2018|access-date=8 January 2018}}</ref> The album was released under Nuclear Blast Records as ''[[Northern Chaos Gods]]'' on 6 July 2018.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://bravewords.com/news/exclusive-immortal-frontman-demonaz-talks-new-album-i-dont-think-weve-ever-been-as-focused-on-the-songwriting|title=Exclusive: IMMORTAL Frontman DEMONAZ Talks New Album – "I Don't Think We've Ever Been As Focused On The Songwriting"|magazine=[[Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles]]|access-date=18 April 2018|date=18 April 2018}}</ref> The album features original member Demonaz on vocals and guitar.

In August 2020, it was announced that Demonaz and Horgh were involved with a legal dispute over the rights to the band's name. Demonaz had registered the name with the Norwegian Patent Office as his exclusive trademark in July 2019, which was approved; however, Horgh chose to appeal the registration, and the matter was ruled in his favor, meaning that Demonaz no longer has the exclusive right to the Immortal name. Horgh was unaware of the initial sole registration made by Demonaz.<ref>{{cite news|title=IMMORTAL's DEMONAZ And HORGH Are Fighting Over Rights To Band's Name|url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/immortals-demonaz-and-horgh-are-fighting-over-rights-to-bands-name|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=23 November 2020|date=4 August 2020}}</ref>

==Lyrical style<!--'Blashyrkh' redirects here-->==
Immortal's lyrics are based on an overall theme, a realm called '''Blashyrkh'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->, which is said to be "[[demon]]-and-battle-filled"<ref name=Allmusic>{{cite web |last=Serba |first=John |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=immortal-mn0000094102|pure_url=yes}} |title=Immortal |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=18 July 2011}}</ref> and a "fusion of gothic, Nordic, and heroic themes."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Marone|first=V.|year=2014|title=A Winterhorde in a Ravenrealm: Immortal's lyrics as an expression of Northeroic Gothic |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273131967|journal=Aeternum: The Journal of Contemporary Gothic Studies|volume=1 |issue=2|pages=40–60}}</ref> The idea for Blashyrkh came about from Demonaz and Abbath's feelings of isolation living in [[Bergen]]. They created Blashyrkh to mirror those feelings, basing it on Norway, including "winter landscapes", "the woods, the mountains, the darkness, the fog", and "glacial valleys".<ref name="Decibel 2009"/> When writing lyrics, the band's lyricist Demonaz often takes long walks in the Norwegian countryside near his hometown of Bergen for inspiration. Unlike many early black metal bands, Immortal does not have [[Satanism|satanic]]-themed lyrics,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/interviews/a/immortalinterview_2.htm |title=Immortal Interview |website=Heavymetal.about.com |access-date=29 November 2016}}</ref> opting instead for basing the genre's inherent concepts of darkness and evil in the fantasy setting of Blashyrkh. However, on the band's first album, there were a few satanic references but without any lyrics attacking religion.
