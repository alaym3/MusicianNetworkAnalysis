'''The UMC's''' was an American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] duo from the borough of [[Staten Island]] in [[New York City]].<ref name="LarkinDM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Dance Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1998|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0252-6|page=352}}</ref>

The group was composed of [[Haas G]] and [[Kool Kim]], who released the critically acclaimed full-length album ''[[Fruits of Nature]]'' in 1991,<ref name="LarkinDM"/> which garnered chart success with the duo's No. 1 [[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard]] Hot Rap Single, "Blue Cheese", and No. 2 Hot Rap Single, "One To Grow On." (which contains a sample from "Ursalena" by [[Bill Cosby]]) In 1994, the duo released its second album, ''Unleashed'',<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p15208/biography|pure_url=yes}} The U.M.C.'s] at [[AllMusic]]</ref> but split up soon after. 

Since the group's break-up, Haas G (under the names Hassan and Fantom of the Beat) has focused on producing music, most notably garnering a No. 1 hit for [[Lil' Kim]] featuring [[50 Cent]], with "[[Magic Stick]]". Kool Kim reinvented himself as the controversial underground emcee [[NYOIL]].<ref>[http://www.platform8470.com/artists/ai_koolkim.asp Interview with Kool Kim] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212033612/http://www.platform8470.com/artists/ai_koolkim.asp |date=December 12, 2007 }}, Platform8470.com, 2006</ref>
