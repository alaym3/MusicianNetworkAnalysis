'''Cap'n Jazz''' (sometimes stylised as '''caP'n Jazz''' on album artwork) was an American [[emo]] band formed in [[Chicago]] in 1989 by brothers [[Tim Kinsella|Tim]] and [[Mike Kinsella]], who were joined by Sam Zurick and Victor Villarreal. After a number of name changes and the addition of guitarist [[Davey von Bohlen]], the band began to earn a cult following in the Chicago area and the Midwest.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==History==
Cap'n Jazz recorded several singles for independent labels in the early 90s as well as contributing to several compilations.

In 1995, the band released its only full-length album, ''[[Shmap'n Shmazz|Burritos, Inspiration Point, Fork Balloon Sports, Cards in the Spokes, Automatic Biographies, Kites, Kung Fu, Trophies, Banana Peels We've Slipped On and Egg Shells We've Tippy Toed Over]]'' on the Man with Gun label. The album is sometimes referred to as ''Shmap'n Shmazz'', which was printed on top of the CD.<ref name=ss />

The band broke up in July 1995, shortly after Shmap'n Shmazz's release, on the night of a show at [[Little Rock]]'s Das Yutes a Go-Go. In 1998, [[Jade Tree Records|Jade Tree]] assembled a double-disc Cap'n Jazz retrospective titled ''[[Analphabetapolothology]]'' which compiles the band's complete recorded works (save for Naive, their song on ''Achtung Chicago! Zwei''): Shmap'n Shmazz, early singles, material from split releases, compilation tracks, unreleased demos and outtakes and several tracks from their farewell performance in Chicago.

The band's lineup was [[Tim Kinsella]] (vocals); Samuel Zurick (bass guitar); [[Mike Kinsella]] (drums, vocals); Victor Villarreal (guitar, vocals); and [[Davey von Bohlen]] (guitar, vocals from 1994–95).<ref>{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Erin|title=Reviewed: Cap'n Jazz Reunion Show at the Bottom Lounge|url=http://thirdcoastdigest.com/2010/07/reviewed-capn-jazz-reunion-show-at-the-bottom-lounge/|publisher=Vital Media Group|access-date=4 February 2011|archive-date=August 1, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801024013/http://thirdcoastdigest.com/2010/07/reviewed-capn-jazz-reunion-show-at-the-bottom-lounge/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Post-breakup and reunion===

Cap'n Jazz reunited at The Empty Bottle on Friday, January 22, 2010, as part of [[Joan of Arc (band)|Joan of Arc]]'s Don't Mind Control Variety Show. After playing a short, impromptu set in Chicago, the band played its first official reunited show at the annual [[Forecastle Festival]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] on July 10, 2010,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buzzgrinder.com/2010/photos-capn-jazz-at-forecastle/ |title=Photos: Cap'n Jazz at Forecastle |publisher=Buzzgrinder |date=July 13, 2010 |access-date=November 11, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919143549/http://www.buzzgrinder.com/2010/photos-capn-jazz-at-forecastle/ |archive-date=September 19, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref> and a hometown reunion show a week later at the Bottom Lounge, supporting the vinyl re-release of ''Analphabetapolothology'' on Jade Tree Records, where they gained success.<ref name=exclaim.ca>{{cite web|last=Hudson|first=Alex|title=Cap'n Jazz Officially Reunite, Reissue Analphabetapolothology on Vinyl|url=http://exclaim.ca/News/capn_jazz_officially_reunite_reissue_analphabetapolothology_on_vinyl_2|publisher=exclaim.ca|access-date=February 4, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005001457/http://exclaim.ca/News/capn_jazz_officially_reunite_reissue_analphabetapolothology_on_vinyl_2|archive-date=October 5, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Deem|first=Anna|title=Cap'n Jazz Reunite in Chicago After 15-Year Hiatus|url=http://www.spinner.com/2010/01/23/capn-jazz-reunite-in-chicago-after-15-year-hiatus/|publisher=AOL Music|access-date=February 4, 2011}}</ref> Due to the show selling out in about 48 hours, a second show was added the next night.
