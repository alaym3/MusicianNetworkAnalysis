'''Zakarias Lekberg''', better known as '''Zacke''', is a Swedish rapper from [[Luleå]] in northern Sweden.

== Biography ==
Zacke was born in [[Stockholm]], Sweden. His mother is Swedish but his father is from [[Morocco]]. After his parents break up he and his mother moved to [[Luleå]] while Zacke was just a few years old.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gatuslang.se/2012/09/avsnitt-3-zackezakarias-lekberg/|title=Avsnitt 3 – Zacke/Zakarias Lekberg|work=Gatuslang}}</ref>

== Music career ==

Zacke released his first EP [[Var här]] in 2003 and followed that with his second EP [[Färdighaft]] which was produced by Emil Pettersson in 2004. Both of his EPs received good comments from critics{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} and the track [[Anna på glej]] from his second EP was played on [[Sveriges Radio P3|P3]] for a while in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.whoa.nu/2011/03/27/guldgruvan-zacke-var-har/|title=Guldgruvan: Zacke – Var här|work=Whoa}}</ref>

In 2010 he released his first real album [[Visst är det vackert]] and it was a major hit and was praised by almost every reviewer. The album won the prize “Best hiphop” at [[Manifestgalan]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zackemusik.se/2011/02/visst-ar-det-vackert-vinnare-av-manifest/|title=Visst är det vackert vinnare av Manifest! - Zacke|work=zackemusik.se}}</ref>

In February 2013 Zacke released his second and his latest full length solo album Renhjärtat. Just like his previous album Renhjärtat gained good critics and Swedish music papers like Kingsize Magazine gave it 4 out of 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kritiker.se/skivor/zacke/renhjartat/|title=Zacke - Renhjärtat (2013) - 10 recensioner|work=Kritiker.se}}</ref>
Throughout his whole career Zacke has collaborated and made songs with some of Sweden's biggest artists such as [[Movits]], [[Mattias Alkberg]], [[Oskar Linnros]], [[Timbuktu (musician)|Timbuktu]] and [[Alexander Juneblad]]. His close work with the group Movits (also from Luleå) led to a new group called Alaska started by Zacke and [[Johan Rensfeldt]] from [[Movits]].  The idea of the group was to make music that they did not think fitted their two main projects (Movits and Zacke). The duo´s first album Alaska was released in the summer of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingsizemagazine.se/karusellen/intervju-alaska/|title=Intervju – Alaska|work=Kingsizemagazine.se - Svensk hiphop rap musik dans kläder artister tv}}</ref>
Both [[Visst är det vackert]] and [[Renhjärtat]] were produced by [[Anders Rensfeldt]] from [[Movits]].

Critics have praised Zacke ever since his first release in 2003 for his way of expressing himself throughout his lyrics.
