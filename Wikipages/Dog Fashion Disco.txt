'''Dog Fashion Disco''' is an American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Rockville, Maryland]], that was originally active from 1995 to 2007 before disbanding. The band officially reunited on October 10, 2013.

==History==
Combining many different music styles (1960s [[Psychedelic music|psychedelic]], [[jazz]], piano recital, heavy metal, circus music and vocals, among others) Dog Fashion Disco is primarily considered an [[avant-garde metal]] and [[alternative metal]] band.{{cn|date=May 2021}} The band's lyrical content is often highly esoteric and satirical, with constant tongue-in-cheek references to the occult, drug use, and mutilation. Their sound has often been compared to the [[Northern California]] genre-defying act, [[Mr. Bungle]]. The band members themselves have cited their collective influences as being [[Mike Patton]] (Mr. Bungle, [[Faith No More]]), [[Clutch (band)|Clutch]], [[Tool (band)|Tool]], [[System of a Down]] and [[Frank Zappa]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/community/chat/2001-04-25-dogfashiondisco.htm|title=USATODAY.com|website=usatoday30.usatoday.com}}</ref>

===Early years (1995–2000)===
Dog Fashion Disco, or ''DFD'' as many fans refer to them as, was formed in 1995 by Todd Smith, Greg Combs, and John Ensminger, who all went to high school together.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theprp.com/thevault/interviews/dogfashiondisco.shtml |title=Dog Fashion Disco |publisher=Theprp.com |access-date=September 7, 2015}}</ref> Originally their name was ''Hug The Retard'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beowolfproductions.com/DogFashionDiscoInterview.html |title=DOG FASHION DISCO Interview |publisher=Beowolfproductions.com |access-date=September 7, 2015}}</ref> but this was changed name to Dog Fashion Disco before releasing any material, as they felt the name Hug The Retard was too offensive and might cost them fans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.juggle.com/dog-fashion-disco|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130126234530/http://www.juggle.com/dog-fashion-disco|url-status=dead|title=Dog Fashion Disco Background, Music Facts, and Group Influences – Juggle.com|access-date=February 15, 2012|archive-date=January 26, 2013}}</ref> Their first two releases were self-released and low budget products. The first – ''[[Erotic Massage (album)|Erotic Massage]]'' – was funded by a loan taken out by drummer John Ensminger, which his father had to co-sign on and "took nearly a year of local shows to pay off the part of the loan that was used for studio time, printing and pressing"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.razortowrist.com/forum/index.php?topic=60.new#new |title=Dad Hearts You |publisher=Razortowrist.com |access-date=September 7, 2015 }}{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and was released independently by the band in 1997. The second self-released album was titled ''[[Experiments In Alchemy]]'' and released in 1998. ''Experiments'' saw more heavy metal numbers, as opposed to the more ballady feel on many of ''Massage's'' songs. That same year, ''DFD'' signed with Outerloop Records and released ''[[The Embryo's in Bloom]]''. The studio quality of the album is noticeably better than its predecessors, and the band was very pleased with the resulted sound.<ref>{{cite web|author=R. Scott Bolton |url=http://www.roughedge.com/features/dogfashiondisco.htm |title=Interview with Dog Fashion Disco |publisher=Roughedge.com |access-date=January 7, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111075544/http://www.roughedge.com/features/dogfashiondisco.htm |archive-date=January 11, 2016 }}</ref> It was then that their management by Maryland resident Derek J. Brewer began and lasted until they disbanded. Polkadot Cadaver is now also managed by Derek J. Brewer under Outerloop Management.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/OuterloopManagement?sk=info |title=Outerloop Management – Management Service – About |publisher=Facebook |date=January 20, 2010 |access-date=September 7, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.razortowrist.com/blog/2011/07/05/polkadot-cadaver-signs-with-outerloop-management/ |title=Razor to Wrist Records » Polkadot Cadaver Signs with Outerloop Management |publisher=Razortowrist.com |access-date=January 7, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111075544/http://www.razortowrist.com/blog/2011/07/05/polkadot-cadaver-signs-with-outerloop-management/ |archive-date=January 11, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In late 1998, Jeff Siegel would join the band as the keyboard player, replacing Sennen Quigley. This lineup would be the longest lasting lineup and stay intact for over 4 years.

===Rising popularity and personnel changes (2000–2004)===
In 2000, ''DFD'' played on [[USA Network]]'s [[Farmclub.com|FarmClub]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/'FarmClub.com,'+Music+Concert+Series+on+USA+Network+Announces+Encore...-a062029322 |title='FarmClub.com,' Music Concert Series on USA Network Announces Encore Presentation of Ruff Riders – Eve, DMX, The Lox and Drag-On, May 15th. – Free Online Library |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |access-date=September 7, 2015}}</ref> The exposure ''DFD'' received from the show lead them to signing with Spitfire Records.

With the release of their major label debut ''[[Anarchists of Good Taste]]'' in 2001 on Spitfire Records, ''DFD'' saw much wider popularity and distribution of their music than ever before, and recorded a track with [[System of a Down]] front-man, [[Serj Tankian]] providing vocals, "Mushroom Cult" on the ''Anarchists'' album. This song is often wrongly attributed to System of a Down, although Serj Tankian was the only member of System of a Down to perform on the track.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Dog-Fashion-Disco-Anarchists-Of-Good-Taste/release/1189943 |title=Dog Fashion Disco – Anarchists Of Good Taste (CD, Album) |publisher=Discogs.com |access-date=September 7, 2015}}</ref> The band shot their first music video for the song "Leper Friend," and embarked on their first [[United Kingdom|UK]] tour in support of the album. ''DFD'' also toured with the likes of [[Mindless Self Indulgence]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/userboots/shows.html |title=Venues |publisher=Oocities.org |access-date=September 7, 2015}}</ref> and [[Tub Ring]] through 2002.

In 2003, they released ''[[Committed to a Bright Future]]'' on Spitfire Records and supported [[Lacuna Coil]] on their first U.S. headlining tour.<ref>[http://www.lacunacoil.it/biography/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325121422/http://www.lacunacoil.it/biography/ |date=March 25, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apeshit.org/news/lacuna-coil-return-to-headline-us-tour/ |title=LACUNA COIL Return To Headline US Tour &#124; News |publisher=Apeshit |date=November 11, 2003 |access-date=September 7, 2015}}</ref> Although the album contains the same lineup as ''Anarchists'', both guitarist Greg Combs and drummer John Ensminger left the band before it was released, the latter being replaced by Mike "Ollie" Oliver before the album was released (and is pictured in the album booklet, as well as being listed as an official member of the band). Ensminger and Combs were credited as performing on the album, though not as band members. The spot of lead guitar was temporarily filled by Jason Stevens for the ''Committed'' tour, during which bassist and original member Stephen Mears left the band to join the Navy. Mears was replaced by Brian White, and after the tour, Stevens was replaced by [[Margret Heater]] member Jasan Stepp as lead guitarist. This lineup recorded the ''Day of the Dead EP'' and the live album ''The City Is Alive Tonight'', released in 2004 and 2005 respectively, and is the band lineup in ''DFDVD''.

===Rotten Records, ''Adultery'' and hiatus (2005–2007)===
[[Image:Jasandfd fletchers.jpg|thumb|left|Guitarist Jasan Stepp performing with DFD at Fletchers Bar in Baltimore, Maryland.]] [[Image:Dfdfarewell.JPG|thumb|right|The members of Dog Fashion Disco hugging after performing their final song.]]
After a short period of off-time in the first half of 2005 (in which [[The Alter Boys]] sole album was made and released), Oliver quit the band. Shortly after, ''DFD's'' contract with Artemis was ended, and ''DFD'' were signed to Rotten Records. On April 4, 2006, they released their sixth studio album, ''[[Adultery (Dog Fashion Disco album)|Adultery]]'', which featured the return of original drummer John Ensminger. Their CD release party was held at Peabody's in Cleveland on the April 6 with [[Tub Ring]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.domaincleveland.net/index.php?pid=news&aid=1455 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120729232546/http://www.domaincleveland.net/index.php?pid=news&aid=1455 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 29, 2012 |title=Domain Cleveland Entertainment &#124; Cleveland Entertainment is our domain |publisher=Domaincleveland.net |date=June 14, 2013 |access-date=September 7, 2015 }}</ref> The band toured in support for the release of ''Adultery'' along with Tub Ring during the summer of 2006, in which keyboardist Tim Swanson temporarily replaced Jeff Siegel. Many of the shows took place in smaller venues (with subsequently smaller audiences) than their tours while signed to Spitfire and Artemis, and, according to Jasan Stepp, resulted in low morale among the band.

On December 5, 2006, Todd Smith Dog posted a blog entry on Dog Fashion Disco's official [[MySpace]] stating that the band had decided to call it quits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=390698&blogId=201693050 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711070122/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=390698&blogId=201693050 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 11, 2012 |title=Featured Content on Myspace |publisher=Blogs.myspace.com |access-date=September 7, 2015 }}</ref> They performed their farewell show at the Sonar Lounge in Baltimore, Maryland on January 13, 2007, to a capacity crowd, with fans coming from as far away as the [[United Kingdom]]. The band played a marathon 25+ song set, ending with the crowd-favorite "Albino Rhino" from the 1998 ''Experiments in Alchemy'' album (this was a common concert-closer), and played the song "Sweet Insanity" from their newest album, ''Adultery'', for an encore song. Other past band members including Sennan Quigley and Mike "Ollie" Oliver attended to show support for their former musical family.  The show was opened by the band [[Oddzar]]. The event was recorded and then released on the DVD ''[[DFDVD II]]'' by Rotten Records on October 28, 2008.

However, these DVD and acoustic plans have been postponed, and their fate is uncertain.

===2013: ''Committed'' shows and reformation===
The most recent reunion was a two-night set of shows that took place on May 31 and June 1, 2013 at Baltimore Sound Stage, featuring the ''Adultery'' lineup like the previous two reunions. These Shows were preceded by an El-Creepo! "warm up" show at [[The Ottobar]] on May 30, which included drummers John Ensminger and Scott Radway, as well as Jasan Stepp. The first night of the reunion featured original guitarist Greg Combs on stage with ''DFD'' for the first time in over 10 years. At the second show, Smith announced plans for a new album, with the title "Sweet Nothings". On October 10, 2013, a status update via the Polkadot Cadaver Facebook page confirmed that Dog Fashion Disco is officially back together as a band.
