Her first writing credit was on [[Blu Cantrell]]'s debut album, ''[[So Blu]]'', for the song "10,000 Times". She also wrote the song "Got Me Waiting" for [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] singer [[Fantasia Barrino]]'s debut album, ''[[Free Yourself]]''.<ref name="Billboard 1" /> It was when she was writing songs that she met music producer [[Jazze Pha]], whom she called her "music soulmate". In 2002, the two recorded four demos: "[[1, 2 Step]]", "Thug Style", "Pick Up the Phone", and "Lookin' at You", which all appeared on her debut album that was released two years later. "1, 2 Step" was the second single released from it and became a hit.<ref name="Billboard 1" />

''Goodies''{{'}} [[lead single]], [[Goodies (song)|the title track]], featuring [[Petey Pablo]], was released on June 8, 2004.

Although her third album was originally scheduled for a September 2008 release, ''[[Fantasy Ride]]'' was released after several delays in May 2009.

While talking to MTV News, Ciara said, "I'm having a bit more fun with my lyrics. I'm not afraid. In the beginning, I was conscious and really protective and somewhat scared about doing some things. With this album I'm not holding back, there's freedom. It's just the space I'm in right now."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1610701/ciara-talks-fantasy-ride-im-not-holding-back.jhtml|title=Ciara Talks Fantasy Ride: 'I'm Not Holding Back'|website=[[MTV]]|access-date=July 16, 2012}}</ref> It became Ciara's first top ten album in the UK and Canada.
