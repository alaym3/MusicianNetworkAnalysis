{{Expand section|date=August 2018}}

===1975–1983: Early life and career beginnings===
Sezen Aksu released her first single, ''Haydi Şansım/Gel Bana'' in 1975 under the name of "Sezen Seley".<ref name="kimkimdir">{{cite web|url=http://www.kimkimdir.gen.tr/kimkimdir.php?id=794|title=Biography of Sezen Aksu|date=October 2008|publisher=kimkimdir.net}}</ref>  However, she remained undiscovered until her 1976 single<ref name="official">{{cite web|url=http://www.sezenaksu.com.tr/tr/diskografi|title=Sezen Aksu hakkında|date=2008|publisher=Sezen Aksu official}}</ref> ''Olmaz Olsun/Vurdumduymaz'' reached number one in the [[Turkish Music Charts|Turkish charts]].<ref name="official"/> In 1976, Sezen Aksu won the "Promising Female Artist of the Year" award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birzamanlar.net/yilin/76.html|title=Best of 1976|website=Birzamanlar.net|publisher=[[Hey (Journal)|Hey]]|access-date= 5 May 2015}}</ref> Her first album was 1978's ''Serçe'', which earned her a famous nickname,<ref name="kimkimdir"/> first penned by a Turkish journalist.

Aksu finally decided to represent Turkey at the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] in the mid-70s. However, even though she competed in the national finals for the competition three times, with ''Küçük Bir Aşk Masalı'' (A Little Love Tale) as a duet with Özdemir Erdoğan, "Heyamola" which was performed as a trio with Coşkun Demir and Ali Kocatepe, and ''1945'' which was a solo performance, she did not get the chance to represent Turkey abroad. It was to be left to her pupil, [[Sertab Erener]], to win the Eurovision and realise Aksu's dream to push her musical vision further into Europe.

===1980s===
In the 80's, Aksu had a relationship with producer [[Onno Tunç]] that was both romantic and professional. As a couple they put their signatures to works that broke new ground in [[Turkish pop music]], such as ''Sen Ağlama'', ''Git'', ''Sezen Aksu'88'' and ''Sezen Aksu Söylüyor''. Her music matured in the 90's, when she co-produced her best selling album to-date ''[[Gülümse]]'' with Tunç. The A-1 track from the album called ''Hadi Bakalım''  was a hit in Turkey and Europe, and was published as a single in Germany. It was to be later rediscovered in Europop by singer [[Loona (singer)|Loona]] as [[Loona (singer) discography|Rhythm of the Night]]. She also began to produce albums for her vocalists, notably producing [[Aşkın Nur Yengi]]'s debut album ''Sevgiliye'' (To a Lover) again with Tunç. She was to repeat her success as a teacher with artists Sertab Erener and [[Levent Yüksel]].

===1990s–present===
Parting ways with Tunç, in 1995, Aksu branched out with the experimental album ''[[Işık Doğudan Yükselir]]'', drawing both on western classical and regional Turkish musical traditions. This album made her name known outside Turkey and gave her a worldwide audience, especially in Europe. In 1996, she released ''Düş Bahçeleri'' as a tribute to Tunç, who died that same year tragically when his private plane crashed. In 1997, she released ''Düğün ve Cenaze'', this time collaborating with [[Goran Bregovic]].

She returned to her roots with ''[[Adı Bende Saklı]]'', which was released in 1998. She began to use experimental sounds and was once again pushing Turkish pop into the future. Aksu continued with this trend with her subsequent albums ''Deliveren'', ''Şarkı Söylemek Lazım'' (which also featured former [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]] bassist [[Martin Gordon]] as engineer/mixer, who also was bass player on her subsequent European tour), and ''Yaz Bitmeden'' between the years 2000–2003. After a two-year hiatus, she returned with ''Bahane'' in 2005. That same year she released ''Kardelen'', where all proceeds went to charity, and before the end of 2005 released a ''Bahane/Remixes'' double-CD album, which contained the original ''Bahane'' album in disc one and the remixes of songs in disc two.

[[File:Sezen Aksu2009 018.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Sezen Aksu's concert at [[Maltepe University]], 2009.]]
In 2005, she was featured in [[Fatih Akın]]'s documentary film "[[Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul]]" with a performance of the song "İstanbul Hatırası". In 2006, Aksu published a book called ''Eksik Şiir'', a collection of 197 songs written by her between 1975-2006. The book was well-received and sold 17,000 copies in the first 4 days after its release.<ref>[http://arsiv.ntvmsnbc.com/news/394276.asp/ Sezen Aksu'nın Eksik Şiiri rekor gidiyor] NTV News</ref><ref>[http://www.haberler.com/eksik-siir-daha-bitmedi-haberi/ Eksik Şiir Daha Bitmedi] Haberler</ref> It was followed by ''Eksik Şiir İkinci Kitap'' in 2016.

In 2008, Aksu released her album called ''Deniz Yıldızı'' through Starfish Records. In 2009 she released her album ''Yürüyorum Düş Bahçelerinde''. The album contains new original songs as well as some older songs which were composed by Sezen Aksu for other singers, most notably "Çakkıdı", "Kibir", "Yok Ki".
