'''Snatam Kaur Khalsa''' {{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|n|ɑː|t|ə|m|_|ˈ|k|ɔːr}} ({{lang-pa|'''ਸਨਾਤਮ ਕੌਰ ਖ਼ਾਲਸਾ'''}}, born 1972 in [[Trinidad, Colorado|Trinidad]], [[Colorado]]), is an American singer, songwriter and author.  Kaur performs new age Indian devotional music, [[kirtan]], and tours the world as a [[peace activist]]. The surname "[[Kaur]]", meaning "princess", is shared by all female [[Sikh]]s.

==Early life and education==
Her family moved to [[California]] when Snatam was two, living in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]].  When Snatam was six, the family visited [[India]], where her mother studied [[kirtan]]. Snatam lived on a ranch near [[Bolinas, California]] until 8th grade and then moved to [[Mill Valley]] in 1986. During her childhood, she played kirtan with her mother in Sikh temples and at [[Sikh]] religious ceremonies. She attended [[Tamalpais High School]] in [[Mill Valley, California|Mill Valley]]. While at Tam High, she played violin in the school orchestra and began songwriting. [[Bob Weir]] of the [[Grateful Dead]] coached Kaur and her classmates before they performed her song "Saving the Earth" at an [[Earth Day]] concert in [[San Francisco]] on April 22, 1990.<ref name=OfficialWeb>{{cite web|title=Snatam Kaur Official Website|url=http://www.snatamkaur.com/|work=snatamkaur.com|accessdate=11 July 2012}}, https://www.newrenbooks.com/about/interviews/kaur.html</ref>

Snatam was also active in social and environmental causes while in high school, serving as president of a social action club known as "Students for Justice" in her senior year. The club started a campus recycling program and organized environmental awareness programs. The club also led the effort to change the school mascot and sports team names from the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] to the [[red-tailed hawk|Red Tailed Hawk]] in 1989 and 1990, inspired by a speech given at the school by [[Sacheen Littlefeather]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thetamnews.org/2013/04/letting-the-indian-go-the-evolution-of-the-tam-mascot/|title=Letting the Indian Go: The Evolution of the Tam Mascot|date=22 April 2013}}</ref>

After graduating from Tam, Snatam attended [[Mills College]] in [[Oakland, California]], receiving a [[bachelor's degree]] in biochemistry.  She then returned to India to study Kirtan under her mother's teacher, Bhai Hari Singh. In 1997, Kaur began a career as a food technologist with Peace Cereals in [[Eugene, Oregon]].<ref name=OfficialWeb />

==Snatam's music==
In 2000, Kaur signed with Spirit Voyage Records — the founder of which, Guru Ganesha Singh Khalsa, became her manager and guitarist. Her professional collaboration has included new age music producer Thomas Barquee and occasionally her mother, Prabhu Nam Kaur Khalsa, also a musician.<ref name=OfficialWeb />

==Sikh influence on Kaur's music==
[[Sikhism]] is a religion that began in India in the mid-fifteenth century with the first Guru, known as [[Guru Nanak]] Dev Ji (1469-1539 C.E.). The essence of being a Sikh is that one lives one’s life according to the teachings of the Sikh Gurus, devoting time to meditating on God and the scriptures, chanting, and living life in a way that benefits other people and the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sikhism.about.com/od/sikhism101/a/Sikhism.htm |title=The Three Principles of Sikhism |publisher=Sikhism.about.com |date=2013-12-25 |accessdate=2014-01-04}}</ref>  Kaur’s teacher, [[Yogi Bhajan]] (1929-2004), was influential in helping promote the Sikh tradition in the West.<ref>Khalsa, Shanti Kaur Khalsa (1995). ''The History of Sikh Dharma of the Western Hemisphere''. Espanola, NM: Sikh Dharma; McLeod, Hew (1997). ''Sikhism''. London: Penguin Books.</ref>

Sikhism is based on the Shabad Guru. On Kaur's official website she explains, “Shabad is the sacred energy or recitation of sound, and Guru means the living teacher. For Sikhs, our living Guru exists within the sacred words of our tradition and physically within the Sikh holy book known as the [[Guru Granth Sahib]].” <ref name=OfficialWeb />
