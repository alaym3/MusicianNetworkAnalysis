He is best known for being one of [[Justin Bieber]]'s main collaborators, having co-written many of Bieber's hits (including "[[Despacito|Despacito (Remix)]]", "[[Where Are Ü Now]]", "[[What Do You Mean?]]", "[[PYD (song)|PYD]]", "[[Hold Tight (Justin Bieber song)|Hold Tight]]" and "[[All That Matters (Justin Bieber song)|All That Matters]]"), and for co-writing the song "[[Caught Up (Usher song)|Caught Up]]" from [[Usher (singer)|Usher]]'s [[RIAA certification|diamond-certified]] album [[Confessions (Usher album)|''Confessions'']].

==Early years==
Boyd was born in Connecticut. He moved with his mother to Atlanta at age 9, after a tornado left them homeless.<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news|title=Poo Bear, Speaking Softly and Carrying a Bieber Comeback |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/18/arts/music/poo-bearspeaking-softly-and-carrying-a-bieber-comeback.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date= October 15, 2015|access-date=18 November 2015|last1= Coscarelli|first1= Joe}}</ref> His first career breakthrough came from working with R&B group [[112 (band)|112]], for whom he composed the songs "[[Dance with Me (112 song)|Dance with Me]]" and "[[Peaches & Cream (112 song)|Peaches & Cream]]".<ref>{{cite web |title='I'm like a secret assassin': Poo Bear on writing for Justin Bieber, Skrillex and Sam Smith |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/apr/09/im-like-a-secret-assassin-poo-bear-on-writing-for-justin-bieber-skrillex-and-sam-smith |website=www.theguardian.com|date=April 8, 2017 }}</ref>

==Career==
Following his early success with 112, Boyd continued to write with other artists, including [[Chris Brown]], [[Jill Scott]] and [[Mariah Carey]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Poo Bear |url=https://www.bmg.com/de/artist/Poo-Bear |website=bmg.com|date=May 5, 2017 }}</ref> In 2004, Usher's album ''[[Confessions (Usher album)|Confessions]]'' was released, containing the single ''[[Caught Up (Usher song)|Caught Up]]'', which Boyd co-wrote with [[Ryan Toby]] and producers [[Dre & Vidal]]. The album was certified diamond by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], selling over 10 million copies in the US,<ref>{{cite web |title= Usher's 'Confessions' Album Hits 10 Million in U.S. Sales |url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/482065/ushers-confessions-album-hits-10-million-in-us-sales|website=billboard.com}}</ref> and is largely considered s one of the best albums of the decade.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 100 Best Albums of The Complex Decade |url= http://uk.complex.com/music/2012/04/the-100-best-albums-of-the-complex-era/yeah-yeah-yeah-fever-to-tell|website=uk.complex.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Usher's Confessions-The R&B record that defined Generation Y |url=http://revolt.tv/video/ushers-confessions-the-randb-record-that-defined-generation-y/C92AB980-0A19-4D2B-9EB7-6CA76387A9D6 |website=revolt.tv |access-date=November 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905053930/https://revolt.tv/video/ushers-confessions-the-randb-record-that-defined-generation-y/C92AB980-0A19-4D2B-9EB7-6CA76387A9D6 |archive-date=September 5, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= Best of the 2000s |url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/266342/best-of-the-2000s-part-1|website=billboard.com}}</ref> "Caught Up" was the fifth single released from the album, peaking at number 8 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

While in [[Las Vegas]] in January 2013, Boyd was introduced to Justin Bieber through rapper [[Lil Twist]] and other friends of Bieber's. The two bonded over similar upbringings and tastes in music, and traveled the world together while working on music for Bieber's album. During this time, Boyd eschewed working with other artists, devoting his time exclusively to Bieber.<ref name=nytimes/> He co-wrote the majority of the songs on Bieber's albums ''[[Journals (album)|Journals]]'' and ''[[Purpose (Justin Bieber album)|Purpose]]'', including "No Pressure" (where he is also credited as producer), "[[PYD (song)|PYD]]", "[[All That Matters (Justin Bieber song)|All That Matters]]", and the double-platinum selling singles "[[Where Are Ü Now]]" (No. 8 ''Billboard'' Hot 100) and "[[What Do You Mean?]]" (No. 1 ''Billboard'' Hot 100). On April 27, 2018, Boyd released his debut studio album ''[[Poo Bear Presents Bearthday Music]]'' via [[Capitol Records]].

In the latter part of the 2010s, Boyd's work found success in both the Latin and Country music genres. "[[Despacito|Despacito (Remix)]]" was named the #1 Latin song in the history of the ''Billboard'' charts,<ref>{{cite web |title=The Top 20 Latin Songs of All Time on the Billboard Charts |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8475322/the-top-20-latin-songs-of-all-time-billboard-charts |website=billboard.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916032904/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8475322/the-top-20-latin-songs-of-all-time-billboard-charts |archive-date=September 16, 2018 }}</ref> and [[Dan + Shay]]'s hit "[[10,000 Hours (song)|10,000 Hours]]" reached #1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Songs Chart.

In addition, Jason manages to produce the songs "Mañana es Too Late" and "Lo Nuestro es Más", by the Mexican pop duo [[Jesse & Joy]], where the first song is a collaboration with the Colombian reggaeton singer, José Álvaro Osorio Balvín, better known as [[J Balvin]].
