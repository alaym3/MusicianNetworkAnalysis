'''Fox''' were a British-based [[pop music|pop]] band popular in the mid-1970s. Led by American songwriter and record producer [[Kenny Young]], the band was perhaps best known for its charismatic Australian lead singer [[Noosha Fox]]. They achieved three top 20 hits on the [[UK Singles Chart]] - "[[Only You Can]]" and "[[Imagine Me, Imagine You]]" in 1975 and "[[S-S-S-Single Bed]]" in 1976, and Noosha Fox achieved a solo hit in 1977 with "Georgina Bailey".

==Band history==
The band was founded by Young, who had composed the song "[[Under the Boardwalk]]" for [[the Drifters]] in 1964. Young had worked off and on with the Australian singer Susan Traynor on one of his solo albums, ''Last Stage For Silverworld'', where she was listed as 'Amanda' after Young had written [[Reparata and the Delrons]]' "[[Captain of Your Ship]]", which had been a UK [[hit record|hit]].

Young then discovered [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] singer [[Clodagh Rodgers]] on a television show, who had recently released the single, "Play The Drama till The End". The partnership produced hit singles over a three-year period, beginning with "Come Back and Shake Me". With this, Rodgers became something of a blueprint{{clarify|date=July 2012}} for the group, as she recorded [[demo (music)|demos]] of some of the songs which would eventually surface on the first Fox album in 1975, as well as earlier Young tunes. Rodgers' husband John Morris was the first manager of the group.<ref>Wilde, Diana: The Glam Rock Files. Independent September 2017. {{ISBN|978-1549647253}}. Pages 62-63</ref>

Meanwhile, Traynor was in a [[folk music|folk]] group called Wooden Horse, which released two albums before breaking up. After his success with Rogers, Young founded Fox with Irish singer [[Herbie Armstrong]], recruiting Traynor as lead singer.<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|page=905}}</ref> She adopted the stage name 'Noosha', a scrambled version of her own name, and a glamorous image inspired by [[Marlene Dietrich]], wearing elegant dresses to contrast with the scruffy look of the rest of the group.

The band's [[Fox (album)|self-titled]] debut album was released on [[GTO Records]] in 1975 to critical acclaim.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> The lead single, "Only You Can", was originally released in mid-1974 under the title "Only You" and failed to chart, but was reissued at the beginning of 1975 with a word added to its title and was a Top 10 hit in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/> The follow-up "[[Imagine Me, Imagine You]]" later the same year also reached the Top 20<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> and "He's Got Magic" was a hit in some European countries. The track "Love Ship" was played extensively on [[Radio Caroline]], and was subsequently adopted as one of their [[theme music|theme tunes]] in the 1970s. Shortly after the release of their first album, Fox made a [[cameo appearance]] in the film ''[[Side by Side (1975 film)|Side by Side]]''.

However, Noosha shared vocals with other members of the band in 1975 follow-up album, ''[[Tails of Illusion]]'', with the songs sung by Noosha, Young, Frank, and Armstrong. The album enjoyed some cult critical acclaim but not the sales success of its predecessor; without Noosha's distinctive voice, casual listeners did not associate the songs with the band that had recorded "Only You Can".{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] added backing vocals to the song "Survival".

The band returned to the [[record chart|charts]] in April 1976 when "S-S-S-Single Bed" was a Top 5 UK hit,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> and topped the Australian chart. ([[Bananarama]] did their own version of this song in 2009 on their album ''[[Viva (Bananarama album)|Viva]]''.) Again, the band did not attempt to capitalise upon its previous success, and the accompanying album ''[[Blue Hotel (album)|Blue Hotel]]'' (1977),<ref name="LarkinGE"/> yielded only one further single, even though Noosha was the lead singer on all its tracks.

Noosha Fox left the band after ''Blue Hotel''.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Armstrong and Young continued to work together in the band [[Yellow Dog (band)|Yellow Dog]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Their second single for Virgin became the first hit single that Virgin Records released, "Just One More Night" making it to No. 8 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. After a short period of success, Armstrong went on to work with [[Van Morrison]], and Solley later joined Procol Harum.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Noosha launched a solo career, and her first single, "Georgina Bailey",<ref name="LarkinGE"/> written and produced by Young, briefly entered the Top 40 in the UK Singles Chart (reaching number 31) in 1977.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/>

In 1979, Noosha Fox tried to restart her solo career with a single, "The Heat Is On" (a song written by Florrie Palmer and [[Tony Ashton]]), on [[Chrysalis Records]]. A [[The Heat Is On (Agnetha song)|later version]] of the song, by [[ABBA]]'s [[Agnetha Fältskog]], was a European hit four years later. Noosha recorded several singles in the early 1980s for the Earlobe label but none were successful, and she evidently retired from the [[music industry]], although she did not return to Australia.
 
Fox reformed briefly in 1980, releasing the [[New wave music|new wave]]-influenced "Electro People", written as the theme music for the ''[[Kenny Everett]] Show''. The band considered a reunion in the early 1990s, but the tracks recorded at this time were unreleased until 2004, when they appeared as bonus tracks on the ''Tails of Illusion'' CD.

==After the band==
It was reported in 2007 on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''The Music Group'' and again in April 2011<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bengoldacre/status/53944306087632896 |title=Twitter / bengoldacre: @alexispetridis haha no i mean |publisher=Twitter.com |date=2011-04-01 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/may/29/critics-notebook-alexis-petridis | location=London | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | first=Alexis | last=Petridis | title=Alexis Petridis on pop's worst year | date=29 May 2011}}</ref> that Noosha Fox was working on new material, but as of 2020 no material has been released commercially.

Herbie Armstrong recently tried to find solo success, appearing on the 2011 series of ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]''. He made it through to the live semi-finals but did not make it through to the final. In his semi-final, he appeared singing a version of [[Barry Manilow]]'s hit, "[[Mandy (Barry Manilow song)|Mandy]]".
