'''Cigarettes After Sex''' is an American [[dream pop]] band formed in [[El Paso, Texas]], in 2008 by Greg Gonzalez. The band is known for their ethereal, [[Limerence|limerent]] and often dream-like musical style, lyrics often based on the themes of romance and love, as well as Gonzalez's voice, which has been described as "[[androgynous]]".<ref name="Noisey" /> While marketed as an [[ambient pop]] band, Cigarettes After Sex are also considered to be [[Shoegazing|shoegaze]], [[slowcore]] and [[indie rock]].

The band's debut extended play (EP), ''I.'', was released in 2012, with the song "Nothing's Gonna Hurt You Baby" eventually becoming a [[sleeper hit]] through commercial [[Music licensing|licensing]]. After the release of the standalone single "Affection" in 2015, the band released their [[Cigarettes After Sex (album)|self-titled debut studio album]] in June 2017 to positive reviews. 

The band's second studio album, ''[[Cry (Cigarettes After Sex album)|Cry]]'', was released on October 25, 2019.

==History==
Cigarettes After Sex was formed in [[El Paso, Texas]], in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |last=Simpson |first=Dave |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/apr/19/cigarettes-after-sex-review-manchester |title=Cigarettes After Sex review – breathtaking ambient-pop enigmas |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=April 19, 2017 |accessdate=September 1, 2017}}</ref><ref name="TheEcho">{{Cite web|url=http://www.theecho.com/event/1125995-cigarettes-after-sex-los-angeles/|title=Cigarettes After Sex - Tickets - The Echo - Los Angeles, California - April 27th, 2016|website=The Echo and Echoplex|access-date=2016-04-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170616164112/http://www.theecho.com/event/1125995-cigarettes-after-sex-los-angeles/|archive-date=2017-06-16|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="Noisey" /> Gonzalez recorded the first EP, ''I.'', in a four-story stairway at his alma mater, [[University of Texas at El Paso]], calling the experience "basically an accident; kind of an experiment".<ref name="Noisey" />

Gonzalez relocated to [[Brooklyn]], New York, where the band's single "Affection" was recorded and released in 2015 along with a cover of [[REO Speedwagon]]'s "[[Keep On Loving You (song)|Keep On Loving You]]".<ref name="CAS">{{Cite web|url=http://cigarettesaftersex.com/records.html|title=Records|website=Cigarettes After Sex|access-date=2016-04-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419150648/http://cigarettesaftersex.com/records.html|archive-date=2016-04-19|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="IMN">{{Cite web|url=http://independentmusicnews.com/review-cigarettes-after-sex-affection/|title=Review / Cigarettes After Sex / Affection|website=Independent Music News|access-date=2016-04-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711094534/https://independentmusicnews.com/review-cigarettes-after-sex-affection/|archive-date=2018-07-11|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Through music recommendations, Cigarettes After Sex became popular on [[YouTube]], leading to live performances across Europe, Asia, and the United States. The band then released their [[Cigarettes After Sex (album)|self-titled debut studio album]] on June 9, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cigarettesaftersex.com/|title=Cigarettes After Sex|website=Cigarettes After Sex}}</ref><ref name="Noisey" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/10-new-artists-you-need-to-know-january-2016-20160125/cigarettes-after-sex-20160124|title=Cigarettes After Sex - 10 New Artists You Need to Know: January 2016|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2016-04-14}}</ref>

In August 2019 the band announced their second studio album, titled ''[[Cry (Cigarettes After Sex album)|Cry]]'', along with the single "Heavenly". The album was released on October 25, 2019.

”Falling in Love” took two years to write, after Gonzalez met his current girlfriend, Nour Petite. “I wrote the chorus in the middle of a bunch of tours, very far from love or real relationships, and trying to write that song would’ve felt dishonest. By the time we got into the studio, I was seeing my current girlfriend and wrote from a real perspective,” Gonzalez pauses before continuing. “It felt very strange, in a way, to finally have that.”{{cn|date=August 2021}}

==Musical style and influences==
In a feature for Noisey by ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'', Christina Cacouris describes Cigarettes After Sex as "elemental, hazy and romantic, but with a noir edge underneath Gonzalez's androgynous voice" as well as "sweet and sentimental".<ref name="Noisey">{{Cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/the-diehard-romanticism-of-cigarettes-after-sex|title=The Diehard Romanticism of Cigarettes After Sex {{!}} NOISEY|website=NOISEY|access-date=2016-04-13}}</ref> "As the band’s name suggests, it’s reminiscent of lying in bed, but its ambient qualities don’t prevent it from being music you can dance to."<ref name="Noisey" /> Gonzalez cites [[Françoise Hardy]] as his favorite singer and [[Miles Davis]] as having great impact.<ref name="Noisey" /> In an interview with ''Sound of Boston'', he also noted films such as ''[[L'Avventura]]'' and ''[[The Double Life of Veronique]]'' were influential to the feel and sound of the music in "Affection" and their LP.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bedian |first1=Knar |title=Interview: Cigarettes After Sex |url=http://soundofboston.com/interview-cigarettes-sex/ |website=Sound of Boston |publisher=Sound of Boston |accessdate=6 November 2018}}</ref> The band also includes The Cowboy Junkies' album ''[[The Trinity Session]]'', [[Julee Cruise]], and [[Cocteau Twins]] as influences.<ref name="TheEcho" /><ref name="Eardrums">{{Cite web|url=http://eardrumsmusic.com/2015/10/20/new-music-cigarettes-after-sex-affection/|title=New Music: Cigarettes After Sex – "Affection"|website=Eardrumsmusic.com|access-date=2016-04-13}}</ref> The music blog Eardrums Music describes the band as "slow, dreamy and beautiful with gorgeous, tender vocals and very good lyrics." and compares it to [[Mazzy Star]]<ref name="Eardrums" /> Music bloggers behind Swell Tone describe Cigarettes After Sex as a band producing "melancholy, slow pop that will sweetly rock any listener into a listless stupor."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://swelltonemusic.com/2015/10/tune-cigarettes-after-sex-affection/|title=Tune: Cigarettes After Sex – "Affection"|website=Swell Tone|access-date=2016-04-14}}</ref>

Reviewing ''Affection'' for Independentmusicnews.com, Jae Pyl concludes that "there's just such an intimacy to Cigarettes After Sex's sound that it's impossible to not let it into the pit of your belly."<ref name="IMN" />

The band's song "Apocalypse" is included in the soundtrack of [[Srecko Horvat|Srećko Horvat's]] book ''Poetry from the Future.''<ref>{{cite book |last=Horvat |first=Srećko |date=2019 |title=Poetry from the Future: Why a Global Liberation Movement Is Our Civilisation's Last Chance |url=https://www.penguin.com.au/books/poetry-from-the-future-9780141987705 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9780141987705}}</ref>
