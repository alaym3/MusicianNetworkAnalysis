'''Altered Images''' were an early 1980s Scottish [[New wave music|new wave]]/[[post-punk]] band. Fronted by singer [[Clare Grogan]], the band branched into mainstream pop music, having six UK top 40 hit singles and three top 30 albums between 1981 and 1983.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> Their hits included "[[Happy Birthday (Altered Images song)|Happy Birthday]]", "[[I Could Be Happy]]", "See Those Eyes", and "[[Don't Talk to Me About Love]]".

==History==
===Early career===
Former schoolmates with a shared interest in the UK [[post-punk]] scene, [[Clare Grogan]] (vocals), Gerard "Caesar" McInulty (guitar), Michael "Tich" Anderson (drums), Tony McDaid (guitar), and [[Johnny McElhone]] (bass guitar), were all members of the [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] official fan club. When they learnt that the Banshees were going to play in Scotland, they sent a demo tape to Billy Chainsaw, who managed the official Siouxsie fan club with a note asking: "can we support them on tour?".<ref>{{cite web|first=Phil|last=Marriott|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aR18iMqal0g&t=582s |title=Clare Grogan on Altered Images 2019 Interview|publisher=youtube|date=25 April 2019|access-date=25 November 2019}}</ref> The Banshees gave the band a support slot on their ''[[Kaleidoscope (Siouxsie and the Banshees album)|Kaleidoscope]]'' British tour of 1980. Altered Images's name referred to a sleeve design on the [[Buzzcocks]]' single "Promises", and was inspired by Buzzcocks vocalist [[Pete Shelley]]'s constant interfering with the initial sleeve designs.<ref name=wilson/>

After being championed by [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[John Peel]], for whom they recorded a radio session in October 1980,<ref name="KIP" /> they garnered enough attention to be offered a [[recording contract]] with [[Epic Records]],<ref name="Strong" /> but mainstream success was not immediate; their debut [[Single (music)|single]], "Dead Pop Stars", reached only number 67 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], while its successor, "A Day's Wait" stalled outside the top 100.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> "Dead Pop Stars" was particularly controversial at the time, sung from the viewpoint of a "has-been" icon with irony, but badly timed in its release shortly after [[John Lennon]]'s death, even though the song was written and performed before his death. A dance remix of it with different lyrics was recorded and released as the 1982 single "Disco Pop Stars". (Both were absent from their studio album releases, but made it onto later anthologies.) After these singles and their first two sessions for John Peel, Caesar left and formed [[The Wake (UK band)|The Wake]].<ref name="Strong" />

===Chart success===
With additional guitarist Jim McKinven (formerly of [[Berlin Blondes]]), they recorded their debut album, ''[[Happy Birthday (Altered Images album)|Happy Birthday]]'' (1981), largely produced by [[Steven Severin]] of Siouxsie and the Banshees.<ref name="Strong" /> The band also worked briefly with producer [[Martin Rushent]] for [[Happy Birthday (Altered Images song)|the title track]], which became the band's third single and their biggest hit.<ref name="Larkin" /> The song reached number 2 in the UK (for three weeks) in October 1981,<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> catapulting the band to fame. They quickly became established as one of the biggest [[New wave music|new wave]] acts around, and were subsequently voted "Best New Group" at the [[NME Awards|''NME'' Awards]] and "Most Promising New Act" in the 1981 ''[[Smash Hits]]'' readers poll.

After a successful headlining tour, the band retained Rushent as their producer and released their second album, ''[[Pinky Blue]]'', in May 1982. It reached the top 20 of the [[UK Albums Chart]] and provided three more top 40 hit singles with "[[I Could Be Happy]]", "See Those Eyes", and the title track,<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums" /> but was perceived as a disappointment by the British press.<ref name="Larkin" /><ref name=gazette /> "I Could Be Happy" was the group's only foray onto the US charts, with the single peaking at number 45 on the ''Billboard'' Dance Chart.<ref>{{cite book |title= Hot Dance/Disco: 1974–2003|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |author-link=Joel Whitburn |date=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=20}}</ref>

Later that year, after McKinven and Anderson left to be replaced by multi-instrumentalist Steve Lironi (formerly of Restricted Code),<ref name="Strong" /> the band began working on their third album with producer [[Mike Chapman]]. The collaboration provided them with another Top 10 hit, "[[Don't Talk to Me About Love]]", in spring 1983 and the subsequent album, ''[[Bite (Altered Images album)|Bite]]'', was released in June.<ref name="Strong" /> Half of the album was produced by Chapman, and half by [[Tony Visconti]].<ref name="Larkin" /><ref name=gazette/> Although it reached the top 20 of the UK Albums Chart, the album sold less than the band's two previous offerings (which had both earned a Silver disc). Before breaking up later that year, Altered Images went on another concert tour that included the band's American debut at the [[Golden Bear (nightclub)|Golden Bear]] in Huntington Beach, California, on Thursday, 11 August 1983.<ref name=lat/><ref name=lat2/>

===Break-up===
After the break-up of the band, Grogan attempted a solo career, signing to [[London Records]] in 1987 and releasing a single, "Love Bomb".<ref name="Strong" /> Grogan was also included on a London Records [[compilation album]] titled ''Giant'', contributing the track "Reason Is the Slave". After "Love Bomb" failed, plans for a follow-up single release, titled "Strawberry", and an album, ''Trash Mad'', were shelved by London Records.

Grogan also became a film and television actress. Prior to finding fame with Altered Images, she had appeared in the 1981 film ''[[Gregory's Girl]]''. Afterwards she appeared in ''[[Red Dwarf]]'' (in which she originated the role of [[Kristine Kochanski]]), ''[[EastEnders]]'',<ref name=record/> ''[[Father Ted]]'', and ''[[Skins (TV series)|Skins]]''.<ref name="Larkin" /><ref name=record /> In recent years she has also become a presenter on UK television, as well as a children's novelist.<ref name="Strong" /><ref name=scotsman/> Grogan performed again in 2012 under the name Altered Images at [[Butlins|Butlins Holiday Resort]] in [[Minehead]] on 11 May and at The Assembly in [[Leamington Spa]] on 12 May 2012.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} Also in 2012, Grogan put together a new all-female version of Altered Images and performed at the [[Rebellion Festival]].<ref name="Newall" /> She again fronted Altered Images in Series 5 Episode 5 (December 2019) of The Quay Sessions on [[BBC Scotland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000cvrx/the-quay-sessions-series-5-5-christmas-at-the-quay|title=The Quay Sessions Series 5-5 Christmas at the Quay|website=[[BBC iPlayer]]|access-date=22 December 2019}}</ref>

Lironi formed Flesh after Altered Images split up.<ref name="Strong" /> Grogan and Steve Lironi (who eventually married)<ref name=record/> formed Universal Love School in the mid-1980s, performing together but never releasing any recordings.<ref name="Strong" /> Johnny McElhone went on to perform with [[Hipsway]] and eventually [[Texas (band)|Texas]],<ref name="Strong" /> while McKinven became part of the 1990s group [[One Dove]] with [[Dot Allison]].<ref name="Strong" />Grogan sang live under the name Altered Images in 2002 for the [[Here and Now Tour]], showcasing a revival of popular bands of their era alongside [[The Human League]], [[ABC (band)|ABC]], and [[T'Pau (band)|T'Pau]],<ref name=record/> and again for some separate shows in 2004.

In 2021, Grogan duetted with Sharleen Spiteri on the track "Look What You’ve Done", from ''Hi'', the tenth album released by Johnny McElhone's band [[Texas (band)|Texas]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.clashmusic.com/news/texas-announce-new-album-hi|title=Texas Announce New Album 'Hi'|website=Clash Magazine}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/texas-announce-new-album-hi-and-unveil-new-single-mr-haze__32835/|title=Texas announce new album Hi, share new single Mr Haze|website=www.officialcharts.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.totalntertainment.com/music/mr-haze-the-new-single-from-texas-out-now/|title='Mr Haze' the new single from Texas out now|date=6 April 2021}}</ref>
