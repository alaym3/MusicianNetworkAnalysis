A '''wand''' is a thin, light-weight rod that is held with one hand, and is traditionally made of [[wood]], but may also be made of other materials, such as metal or plastic.
Long versions of wands are often styled in forms of staves or [[sceptre]]s, which could have large ornamentation on the top.

In modern times, wands are usually associated with [[stage magic]] or [[Magic (supernatural)|supernatural magic]], but there have been other uses, all stemming from the original meaning as a synonym of [[wikt:rod|rod]] and [[virge]]. A stick that is used for reaching, pointing, drawing in the dirt, and directing other people, is one of the earliest and simplest of tools.

==History==
It is possible that wands were used by pre-historic peoples. It is mentioned that 'rods' (as well as rings) were found with [[Red Lady of Paviland]] in Britain. It is mentioned by the author in 'Gower - A Guide to Ancient and Historic Monuments on the Gower Peninsula'<ref>Gower - A Guide to Ancient and Historic Monuments on the Gower Peninsula {{ISBN|1-85760-073-8}}</ref> that these might have been wands and are depicted as such in a reconstruction drawing of the burial of the 'Red Lady'.

[[File:Apotropaic Wand - Middle Kingdom - Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|Ancient Egyptian apotropaic wand carved from a Hippopotamus tusk]]
During the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]], [[birth tusk|apotropaic wands]] began to be used during birth ceremonies. These wands were made out of [[Hippopotamus]] [[tusk]]s which were split down the middle lengthwise, producing two wands, each with one flat side and one curved side. Due to the curved nature of a Hippopotamus tusk, these wands were curved, with one pointed end (the point of the tusk) and one blunt end (where the tusk was removed from the Hippopotamus). Hippopotamus tusks may have been used to invoke [[Taweret]] the Hippopotamus goddess of childbirth.<ref>https://www.egypt.swan.ac.uk/the-collection-2/the-collection/bm-ec38192/</ref> The earliest apotropaic wands used in Egypt were undecorated, but "from around 1850 BC, they were usually provided with decorations of apotropaic figures directly related to the sun religion, or particular aspects of it, inscribed on the convex upper side... most of whom carry knives to ward off evil forces".<ref>https://www.academia.edu/30440444/The_Principles_of_Apotropaic_Magic_on_Middle_Kingdom_Wands_in_AEM_99_2016_17_12_17</ref> These apotropaic wands were also inscribed with protective text on the flat side, such as "Cut off the head of the enemy when he enters the chamber of the children whom the lady... has borne".<ref>Steindorff, G. 1946. The magical knives of ancient Egypt. Journal of the Walters Art Gallery, 9, 41-51; 106-107.</ref> The latest apotropaic wand found belongs to the [[Second Intermediate Period]] king [[Senebkay]].<ref>[[Stephen Quirke]]: ''Birth Tusks: the Armoury of Health in Context - Egypt - 1800 BC'', Middle Kingdom Studies 3. London 2016, {{ISBN|9781906137496}}, pp. 208-209</ref> It seems that the use of these objects in Egypt declines after this point.

The [[Barsom]] used by [[Zoroastrian]] [[Magi]] is a bundle of twigs that was used during religious ceremonies. While the Barsom is not a wand itself, it was also used for divination purposes, and may be a form of prototypical wand from which later magical wands descend.<ref>http://esotericarchives.com/wands/index.html</ref>

[[File:Circe Offering the Cup to Odysseus.jpg|right|thumb|[[Circe]] with her magical wand, in ''[[Circe Offering the Cup to Ulysses]]'', an 1891 painting by [[John William Waterhouse]]]]
The concept of magic wands was used by the ancient greek writer [[Homer]], in his [[epic poem]]s ''[[The Iliad]]'' and ''[[The Odyssey]]''. In all cases, Homer used the word ''rhabdos'' (ῥᾰ́βδος), which means 'rod', and implies something that is thicker than the modern conception of wands. In those books, Homer wrote that magic wands were used by three different gods, namely [[Hermes]], [[Athena]], and [[Circe]]. In ''The Iliad'', Homer wrote that Hermes generally used his magic wand [[Caduceus]] to make people sleep and wake up. In ''The Odyssey'', Homer wrote that Athena used her magic wand to make Odysseus old, and then young again, and that Circe used her magic wand to turn Odysseus's men into pigs.

By the 1st century AD, the wand was a common symbol of magic in Roman cults, especially [[Mithraism]]. In the 3rd and 4th centuries, there are frequent depictions on [[sarcophagi]] of [[Jesus Christ]] using a magic wand to perform miracles, such as the [[raising of Lazarus]] and [[feeding the multitude]].

Italian [[fairy tale]]s put wands into the hands of the powerful fairies by the [[Late Middle Ages]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://endicottstudio.typepad.com/articleslist/italian-fairiesfate-folletti-and-other-creatures-of-legendby-raffaela-benvenuto.html |title=Raffaella Benvenuto |work=Italian Fairies: Fate, Folletti, and Other Creatures of Legend |publisher=Endicott-studio.com |access-date=2021-06-06}}</ref>

==Mystical and religious usage==
[[File:Wands01.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Ace of Wands (Tarot card)|Ace of Wands]] from the [[Rider–Waite tarot deck]]]]
Wands are used in [[The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], [[Thelema]], and [[Wicca]], and by independent practitioners of magic.

Wands were introduced into the occult via the 13th-century Latin [[grimoire]] ''[[The Oathbound Book of Honorius]]''. The wand idea from the ''Book of Honorius'', along with various other ideas from that grimoire, were later incorporated into the 16th-century grimoire ''[[The Key of Solomon]]''. ''The Key of Solomon'' became popular among occultists for hundreds of years. In 1888, there was the publication of an English translation of the ''Key of Solomon'' by [[Samuel Mathers]] (one of the co-founders of [[the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]), which made the text of the ''Key of Solomon'' available to the anglophone world. That 1888 English version inspired [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], the creator of [[Wicca]], to incorporate the wand and various other ritual objects into Wicca.

The creators of the Golden Dawn got their idea to use a wand, as well as their other main ritual objects (dagger, sword, hexagrammic [[pentacle]], and cup), from the writings of the mid-19th century occultist author [[Eliphas Levi]]. Levi himself mentioned most of those objects (all except for the cup) in his writings because they are in the ''Key of Solomon'', whereas he got the cup from the [[tarot]] [[suit of cups]]. In Levi's 1862 book ''[[Philosophie Occulte]]'', he wrote a fake excerpt of a Hebrew version of the ''Key of Solomon'', and that fake excerpt was part of the inspiration for the Golden Dawn's ritual objects, and especially their [[lotus wand]].

The [[ceremonial magic]] of [[the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] uses several different types of wands for different purposes, the most prominent of which are the [[fire wand]] and the [[lotus wand]]. In [[Wicca]], wands are traditionally used to summon and control angels and genies,<ref>[[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], ''The Gardnerian Book of Shadows''</ref><ref>[[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]], ''The Alexandrian Book of Shadows''</ref> but have later come to also be used for general spell-casting. Wands serve a similar purpose to [[athame]]s (ritual daggers), though the two objects have their distinct uses: an athame is used to command, whereas a wand is seen as more gentle, and is used to invite or encourage. 

Wands are traditionally made of wood— practitioners usually prune a branch from an [[oak]], [[hazel]], or other tree, or may even buy wood from a [[hardware store]], and then carve it and add decorations to personalize it, though one can also purchase ready-made wands. In [[Wicca]], the wand usually represents the element [[air (classical element)|air]],<ref>[[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]], ''The Alexandrian Book of Shadows''</ref><ref>[[Janet Farrar]] and [[Stewart Farrar]], ''A Witches' Bible'', 1981</ref> or sometimes [[fire (classical element)|fire]] (following the wiccan author [[Raymond Buckland]], who got his element associations from the Golden Dawn), although contemporary wand-makers also create wands for the elements of [[earth (classical element)|earth]] and [[water (classical element)|water]].

===Tarot cards===
The [[suit of wands]] is one of the four suits in the 1909 [[Rider–Waite tarot deck|Rider–Waite–Smith occult tarot deck]], and other, later [[tarot]] decks that are based upon that deck. The suit of wands replaced the [[suit of batons]] from earlier, non-occult tarot decks. The Rider–Waite–Smith tarot deck also replaced the [[suit of coins]] from earlier, non-occult decks, with the [[suit of pentacles]]. The Rider–Waite–Smith tarot deck was designed by two members of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn- [[Arthur Edward Waite]] and [[Pamela Colman Smith]]. Waite provided the general guidelines for the deck (including the names of the four suits, and thus the suit of wands), and detailed guidelines for the designs of the [[Major Arcana]], and he hired Smith to do the painting, and to make original artwork for the [[Minor Arcana]]. Waite instructed Smith to not paint actual ''wands'' in the wand cards, but rather to paint large tree trunk staffs with some foliage growing on them, so as to make an association between wands and [[Eliphas Levi]]'s phrase "the flowering rod of Aaron" from Levi's fake fragment of ''The Key of Solomon''.

==Status symbolism==
In British formal government [[ceremony]], special officials may carry a '''wand of office''' that represents their [[power (sociology)|power]]. Compare in this context the function of the [[ceremonial mace]], the [[scepter]], and the [[staff of office]]. Its age may be even greater, as Stone Age cave paintings show figures holding sticks, which may be symbolic representations of their power.<ref>David Colbert, ''The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter'', p 195, {{ISBN|0-9708442-0-4}}</ref>

==Fiction==
In the 18th-century ballads "[[Allison Gross]]" and "[[The Laily Worm and the Machrel of the Sea]]", the villainesses use silver wands to transform their victims into animals, in emulation of the Odyssey that preceded them.<ref>Francis James Child, ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v 1, p 315-6, Dover Publications, New York 1965</ref> In [[C. S. Lewis]]'s 1950 novel ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', the White Witch's most feared weapon is her wand, whose magic is capable of turning people into stone. This, again, employs the Odysseyan motif of an evil female witch who uses a magic wand to maliciously transform her victims.

In the mid-20th century, the [[MGM]] and [[Disney]] media companies popularized magic wands via four films in which wands were wielded by benevolent female fairy characters. Those films were ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939; MGM; a wand-staff was wielded by [[Glinda the Good Witch]] of the North), ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (1940; Disney; a wand was wielded by "[[The Fairy with Turquoise Hair|the blue fairy]]"), ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950; Disney; a wand was wielded by a "[[Fairy godmother|fairy godmother]]"), and ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' (1959; Disney; a wand was wielded by each of three fairies). In ''The Wizard of Oz'' and ''Pinocchio'', the fairies' wands are embellished with a star-shaped ornament on the end, whereas in ''Cinderella'' and ''Sleeping Beauty'', the fairies have wands with traditional plain tips.

Magic wands commonly feature in works of [[fantasy]] [[fiction]] as [[spell (paranormal)|spell]]-casting [[tool]]s. Few other common denominators exist, so the capabilities of wands vary wildly. In [[J. K. Rowling]]'s [[Harry Potter]] series, the first book of which was published in 1997, personal [[List of wands in Harry Potter|wands]] are common, as necessary tools to channel out each character's magic, and they are used as weapons in magical duels, and it is the wand that chooses its owner. A wand is also present in the ''[[Children of the Red King]]'' series in the possession of [[Characters in Children of the Red King#Charlie Bone|Charlie Bone]] as well as the popular [[MMORPG]] ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' where caster classes such as the mage and warlock use wands offensively.

==Non-magical usage==
