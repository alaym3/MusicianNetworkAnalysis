'''Hinder''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]], formed in 2001 by lead singer [[Austin Winkler]], guitarist Joe "Blower" Garvey, and drummer [[Cody Hanson]] with bassist Mike Roden and guitarist Mark King joining in 2003, solidifying the line-up. They are known as a one hit wonder and have no considerable contributions to modern music outside of their hit “Lips of an Angel”. The band released four studio albums with Winkler; ''[[Extreme Behavior]]'' (2005), ''[[Take It to the Limit (Hinder album)|Take It to the Limit]]'' (2008), ''[[All American Nightmare]]'' (2010) and ''[[Welcome to the Freakshow (Hinder album)|Welcome to the Freakshow]]'' (2012).  Cody Hanson, along with former lead singer Austin Winkler, wrote the majority of the band's music on their first four albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/hinder_we_bring_the_fun_back_into_rock-n-roll.html|title=Hinder: 'We Bring The Fun Back Into Rock-n-Roll!'|website=Ultimate-Guitar.com|date=23 September 2006|access-date=1 May 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505085315/http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/hinder_we_bring_the_fun_back_into_rock-n-roll.html|archive-date=5 May 2010}}</ref> After Winkler left the band in 2013, they looked for a new lead vocalist, and added [[Marshal Dutton]]. They have since released: ''[[When The Smoke Clears]]'' (2015) and ''[[The Reign (Hinder album)|The Reign]]'' (2017) with their new vocalist. Their seventh studio album is currently in the works. The band was inducted into the [[Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame]] in 2007.

==History==
===Formation and ''Far From Close'': 2001–2004===
Before the band formed, Austin Winkler sang in an [[Oklahoma City]] cover band until July 2001,<ref name="songwriter interview"/> when he met drummer Cody Hanson and lead guitarist Joe Garvey at a college party.<ref name="yahoo">{{cite web|url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/hinder/biography/|title=Hinder Biography|publisher=Yahoo! Music|access-date=10 May 2010}}</ref> Soon after meeting, the three formed Hinder. Hanson commented on Austin Winkler shortly after the band formed saying he was "blown away" and "he has the kind of charisma very few people have and that unique voice. You can't really compare him to anybody." After recruiting bassist Cole Parker, they recorded a 4 track demo disc, with the track listing "Someday", "Like Me", "Broken", and "Worthless Home". The tracks "Someday" and "Broken" would later be re-recorded and put on their debut EP ''[[Far From Close]]'' and the other two tracks "Like Me" and "Worthless Home" still remain unreleased, only being able to find them on their demo CDs, although they are now posted on [[YouTube]]. The band began performing at an Oklahoma City club called The Blue Note, building a local fan base. Profits from the shows went to advertising, as well as paying the expenses for the group's first release. In April 2003, Hinder entered the March Bandness contest for [[Oklahoma City]] radio station [[KREF-FM|KHBZ-FM]] (94.7). They made it to the Final Four out of a field of thirty-two, ultimately losing to the OKC group Falcon Five-O. After saving enough money from local concerts the band's debut [[Extended play|EP]] ''Far From Close'' was released in 2003 on the independent label Brickden Records and sold around 5,000 copies.<ref name="Hall of Fame">{{cite web|url=http://www.omhof.com/Inductees/BYYEAR/tabid/86/ItemID/11/Default.aspx|title=Hinder - 2007 Inductee|publisher=Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame|access-date=21 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715001929/http://www.omhof.com/Inductees/BYYEAR/tabid/86/ItemID/11/Default.aspx|archive-date=15 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Bassist Mike Rodden was recruited from Oklahoma City band Shade Seven and rhythm guitarist Mark King joined the band later that year.<ref name="songwriter interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.songwriteruniverse.com/hinder123.htm|title=Austin Winkler Talks About The Band's Success Story|publisher=Songwriter Universe|access-date=10 May 2010}}</ref>

Hinder toured and released singles in support of their first album. Hinder's debut single, "[[Get Stoned]]", was released in October 2005. The band's second single, "[[Lips of an Angel]]", entered charts in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore; the song lasted for 41 weeks in the New Zealand charts, two weeks of which were spent at the number one spot. The band's third single, "[[How Long (Hinder song)|How Long]]", was released in September 2006 and appeared at number six on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart. Their second song to be released in New Zealand was "[[Better Than Me (Hinder song)|Better Than Me]]", which spent three weeks on the New Zealand charts, peaking at number 16. In 2007, Hinder was inducted into the [[Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame]],<ref name="Hall of Fame"/> and in October of the same year, the band released their limited edition CD/DVD of ''Extreme Behavior'' entitled ''You Can't Make This S**t Up''.

The first single from the band's second album, "[[Use Me (Hinder song)|Use Me]]", was released on July 15, 2008 and peaked at No.&nbsp;3 on the US Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The second album, ''[[Take It to the Limit (Hinder album)|Take It to the Limit]]'', was released on November 4, 2008; the album marked a change in style in Hinder's music in that it moved the band in a slightly more [[glam metal]]-influenced direction. The title track features [[Mötley Crüe]]'s [[Mick Mars]] on guitar. They announced the release of the album's second single, "[[Without You (Hinder song)|Without You]]," through their official MySpace page on September 13, 2008. ''Take It To the Limit'' debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 with 81,000 sales its first week and ended up going Gold in the US

Through late 2008, Hinder headlined the [[Jägermeister Music Tour]] with [[Trapt]] and [[Rev Theory]] also on the bill. In early 2009, Hinder embarked on [[Mötley Crüe]]'s [[Saints Of Los Angeles Tour]], which also included [[Theory of a Deadman]] and [[The Last Vegas]]. In July, Hinder embarked on [[Nickelback]]'s [[Dark Horse Tour]], which ran through [[Live Nation]] outdoor amphitheaters; other bands involved on the tour were [[Papa Roach]], [[Breaking Benjamin]] and [[Saving Abel]]. On March 27, 2013 ''Take It To The Limit'' was certified gold in the US.

===''All American Nightmare'' and ''Welcome to the Freakshow'': 2010–2013===
During early 2010, the band was engaged in writing and recording material for their third album,<ref name="rockstar"/> titled ''All American Nightmare''.<ref name="nightmare tunelab">{{cite web|url=http://tunelab.com/2010/05/28/hinder-title-new-album/|title=Hinder Title New Album|website=Tunelab.com|date=28 May 2010|access-date=17 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603040052/http://tunelab.com/2010/05/28/hinder-title-new-album/|archive-date=3 June 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> The album was released on December 7, 2010, with the first single, the title track, released on September 14, 2010.<ref name="rockstar">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockstarweekly.com/hinder-halfway-through-recording-new-album.html|title=Hinder Halfway Through Recording New Album|publisher=Rockstar Weekly|access-date=17 July 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728204524/http://www.rockstarweekly.com/hinder-halfway-through-recording-new-album.html|archive-date=28 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=HINDER - LATEST NEWS|url=http://www.hindermusic.com/home/index.shtml|publisher=Hinder official website|access-date=8 September 2010|date=1 September 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910014302/http://www.hindermusic.com/home/index.shtml|archive-date=10 September 2010}}</ref> Although the album was originally planned to be produced by [[Howard Benson]], [[Kevin Churko]] was later announced to be the producer.<ref name="rockstar"/>

Winkler said that the group started recording during the touring cycle for ''Take It To The Limit''. "We wrote 70 or so songs, recorded about 50 and cut it down to 12," the singer explained. "It's something that we've never done before, so it's like our ultimate baby. A lot of the [other] songs could be shit, too, we don't know. You don't really know until you put it out there and have more than two people's opinion on it." Both he and drummer Cody Hanson mentioned the song "Memory" as one that was a strong contender for the final cut. "It's about being with your chick — the chick you've been with for a while, not some chick you've met on the road — and about being able to still have a good time with your wife or long-time girlfriend," said Hanson. "I've been in a relationship myself for nine years, so it was cool to write a song like that."<ref>{{cite web|title=Hinder Write A Box Set's Worth Of Material For New Album|url=http://www.bryanreesman.com/blog/2010/11/18/hinder-write-a-box-sets-worth-of-material-for-new-album/|publisher=Attention Deficit Delirium|access-date=18 January 2011|date=18 November 2010}}</ref>
