'''Gummibär''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɡʊmibɛːɐ̯|pron|De-Gummibär.ogg}}; German for "gummy bear") is an international multilingual character and [[virtual band]] based in [[Berlin]] that performs [[Gummy bear]]-related songs on various albums, including ''[[I Am Your Gummy Bear]]'' (2007) and ''[[La La Love to Dance]]'' (2010). The video for the song "[[I'm a Gummy Bear]]" has over 2.4 billion views on [[YouTube]].

==Name origins and appearance==

The name "Gummibär" is taken from a German brand of [[Gummy bear|bear-shaped gum candies]] from [[Haribo]] introduced in 1920.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Gummibär biography, discography, songs, lyrics, remixes and more!|url=https://www.bubblegumdancer.com/321-Gummi%C3%A4r/project/|url-status=live|website=Bubblegum Dancer}}</ref> The highly stylized green blue-eyed [[obese]] [[gelatinous]] [[bear]] character is usually naked except for orange Y-front [[briefs]]/[[underwear]] and [[athletic shoe|sneakers]]. Gummibär also seems to be [[bite|bitten]] with a small portion of the upper left ear missing. The bear's muzzle or, allowing for [[anthropomorphism]], his [[mustache]] and [[goatee]], appear to be sugar-crusted, and the character only has two small teeth spaced far apart on his lower jaw. Gummibär's right [[iris (anatomy)|iris]] and [[pupil]] are greater in size than the corresponding left-sided features.

==Popularity==

Gummibär's popularity as a phenomenon is very similar to that of fellow European music phenomenon [[Crazy Frog]], characterized by repetition of lyrics and singing of catchy melodies. Variants of the character's music have been released in various languages internationally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2285316/Gummy-Bear-set-to-take-Crazy-Frogs-mantle.html|title=Gummy Bear set to take Crazy Frog's mantle|first=Richard|last=Alleyne|date=2008-07-11|website=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|access-date=2020-11-30|url-access=subscription}}</ref>
