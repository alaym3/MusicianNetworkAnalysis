'''The Raincoats''' are a British experimental [[post-punk]] band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beardedmagazine.com/index.php/albums/article/the-raincoats-odyshape-we-three|title=The Raincoats - Odyshape (We ThRee) - Bearded Magazine: The Home of Independent Music|website=www.beardedmagazine.com|access-date=22 April 2018}}</ref> [[Ana da Silva]] ([[singing|vocals]], [[guitar]]) and [[Gina Birch]] (vocals, [[bass guitar|bass]]) formed the group in 1977 while they were students at [[Hornsey College of Art]] in London.<ref>[http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/gender-in-humanities/archive.htm "Women and the Rock Business, and the story of the Raincoats" The Open University 7 February 2005] open.ac.uk – Retrieved: 28 July 2007</ref>

Signed to the label [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]], the band released three albums in their early incarnation: ''[[The Raincoats (album)|The Raincoats]]'' (1979), ''[[Odyshape]]'' (1981), and ''[[Moving (The Raincoats album)|Moving]]'' (1984). They reformed in 1993 and released the album ''[[Looking in the Shadows]]'' in 1996.

==History==
===1977–1993===
da Silva and Birch were inspired to make a band after they saw [[The Slits]] perform live earlier that year. Birch stated in an interview with ''She Shreds'' magazine, "It was as if suddenly I was given permission. It never occurred to me that I could be in a band. Girls didn’t do that. But when I saw The Slits doing it, I thought, ‘This is me. This is mine.’”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sheshredsmag.com/40-years-fairytales-retrospective-raincoats/|title=40 Years of Fairytales: A Retrospective of The Raincoats|date=2017-07-13|website=She Shreds Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-03-11}}</ref> For the band's first concert on 9 November 1977 at [[Tabernacle, Notting Hill|The Tabernacle]], the line-up included Birch, da Silva, Ross Crighton (guitar) and [[Nick Turner]] (drums). Kate Korus (from The Slits and later [[the Mo-dettes]]) joined briefly but was replaced by Jeremie Frank. Nick Turner left to form [[the Barracudas]], and [[Richard Dudanski]] (ex-[[The 101ers]] and later [[Public Image Ltd.]]) sat in on drums, while filmmaker [[Patrick Keiller]] replaced Frank on guitar.

Late in 1978, the Raincoats became an [[all-women band|all female]] band as they were joined by The Slits' ex-drummer [[Palmolive (musician)|Palmolive]] and the classically trained violinist [[Vicky Aspinall]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8-NGokpBxFcC&q=raincoats+album&pg=PA103|page=101|title=Cinderella's Big Score: Women of the Punk and Indie Underground|isbn=1580051162|last1=Raha|first1=Maria|year=2005}}</ref> with this line-up making their live debut at Acklam Hall in London on 4 January 1979.<ref>Ian Penman: ''The Raincoats Dresden Banks Vincent Units Acklam Hall.'' In: [[New Musical Express]] 27 January 1979, page 43.</ref> Managed by [[Shirley O'Loughlin]], the band went on their first UK tour with [[Switzerland|Swiss]] female band [[Kleenex (band)|Kleenex]], in May 1979 after [[Rough Trade Records]] released their first [[single (music)|single]], "Fairytale in the Supermarket". [[Johnny Rotten]] was an early admirer of the band, and later stated: "The Raincoats offered a completely different way of doing things, as did [[X-Ray Spex]] and all the books about punk have failed to realise that these women were involved for no other reason than that they were good and original".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/nov/01/sexpistols|title=John Lydon: Soundtrack of my Life|work=[[The Observer]]|date=1 November 2009|first=Will|last=Hodgkinson}}</ref> The Raincoats' distinctly uncommercial sound did not appeal to everyone; after witnessing an early performance by the band, [[Danny Baker]] remarked that "they are so bad that every time a waiter drops a tray we'd all get up and dance".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AZ4L0Pv7QwUC&q=raincoats+album+tray&pg=PA147|page=147|title=She Bop Ii (Gen)|isbn=9780826435293|last1=O'Brien|first1=Lucy|year=2003}}</ref>

On 21 November 1979, Rough Trade released the band's self-titled debut album,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/music/2007/07/forgotten_punk.html |title=Forgotten punk: Little-known records with big influence|date= 20 July 2007|work=The Guardian|first=Alan|last=McGee|author-link=Alan McGee|access-date= 28 July 2007}}</ref><ref>[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,,1241217,00.html Stuart Murdoch: My Top 10 albums] observer.guardian.co.uk – Retrieved: 28 July 2007</ref> which received considerable acclaim from the press.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Palmolive had left the band in September, shortly before ''[[The Raincoats (album)|The Raincoats]]'' came out, and teenager [[Ingrid Weiss]] joined the band on drums. The Raincoats' second album, ''[[Odyshape]]'', was released in 1981 and featured Weiss as well as drumming contributions from Dudanski, [[Robert Wyatt]] ([[The Soft Machine]]) and [[Charles Hayward (musician)|Charles Hayward]] ([[This Heat]]). The Raincoats employed a diverse selection of cheap second-hand instruments such as the [[balophone]], [[kalimba]] and [[gamelan]] on ''Odyshape'', and the album incorporated [[British folk revival|British folk]], [[dub music|dub]] basslines, [[polyrhythm]]ic percussion and elements of [[free jazz]] among other [[world music]] influences. Its eclectic mix of musical genres has been described as one of the "great lost moments of women-in-rock".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Acq7ZOYd_AcC&q=raincoats+odyshape&pg=PT329|page=367|title=The Sex Revolts: Gender, Rebellion, and Rock 'n' Roll|isbn=9780674802735|last1=Reynolds|first1=Simon|year=1996}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dK-F43T8V0wC&q=raincoats+album&pg=PT214|title=Rip it Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978–1984|isbn=9780571252275|last1=Reynolds|first1=Simon|year=2009}}</ref>

<blockquote>"The basic theme in rock'n'roll is what goes on between men and women...Rock'n'roll is based on black music. And it's based ''in'' the exclusion of women and the ghettoization of blacks. Which is why we want to put a bit of distance between what we do and the rock'n'roll tradition."<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1UqP73-KGDYC&q=the+raincoats+women+ghettoization&pg=PA113|page=113|author-link=Greil Marcus|title=In the Fascist Bathroom: Punk in Pop Music, 1977–1992|isbn=9780674445772|last1=Marcus|first1=Greil|year=1999}}</ref> — <small>The Raincoats interviewed by [[Greil Marcus]]</small></blockquote>

In December 1982, the Raincoats recorded a [[live album]] at [[The Kitchen]] arts space in New York. ''[[The Kitchen Tapes (The Raincoats)|The Kitchen Tapes]]'' was released on cassette by [[ROIR]] in 1983.<ref>[http://www.roir-usa.com/8238.htm The Kitchen Tapes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928041550/http://www.roir-usa.com/8238.htm |date=28 September 2007 }} roir-usa.com – Retrieved: 28 July 2007</ref>

The Raincoats recorded ''[[Moving (The Raincoats album)|Moving]]'' in 1984. Tired of constant touring and "pulling in different musical directions", the band members began work on solo projects shortly after the album's release.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DtunaUIgxsEC&q=raincoats+moving&pg=PA183|title=Rough Trade|isbn=9781904772477|last1=Young|first1=Rob|year=2006|author-link=Rob Young (writer)}}</ref> Birch and Aspinall formed Dorothy, while da Silva worked with choreographer Gaby Agis on a series of dance projects and formed Roseland with Hayward.

In 1992, [[Kurt Cobain]] of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] went into the [[Rough Trade Shop]] in Talbot Road, London in search of a new copy of ''The Raincoats'', and Jude Crighton sent him around the corner to see da Silva at her cousin's antique shop. Cobain wrote passionately about this meeting in the liner notes of Nirvana's ''[[Incesticide]]'' album. In late 1993, Rough Trade and [[DGC Records]] reissued the band's three studio albums, with liner notes by Cobain and [[Sonic Youth]]'s [[Kim Gordon]].

<blockquote>"I don't really know anything about the Raincoats except that they recorded some music that has affected me so much that, whenever I hear it I'm reminded of a particular time in my life when I was (shall we say) extremely unhappy, lonely, and bored. If it weren't for the luxury of putting that scratchy copy of the Raincoats' first record, I would have had very few moments of peace. I suppose I could have researched a bit of history about the band but I feel it's more important to delineated the way I feel and how they sound. When I listen to the Raincoats I feel as if I'm a stowaway in an attic, violating and in the dark. Rather than listening to them I feel like I'm listening in on them. We're together in the same old house and I have to be completely still or they will hear me spying from above and, if I get caught – everything will be ruined because it's their thing." — <small>Cobain's liner notes for ''The Raincoats''</small></blockquote>

<blockquote>"I loved The Slits because of their boldness and that they actually had commercial songs, but it was the Raincoats I related to most. They seemed like ordinary people playing extraordinary music. They had enough confidence to be vulnerable and to be themselves without having to take on the mantle of male rock/punk rock aggression...or the typical female as sex symbol avec irony or sensationalism." — <small>Gordon's liner notes for ''Odyshape''</small></blockquote>

Later, Cobain listed the Raincoats debut album at No. 20 in his 50 favorite albums.<ref name="joyfulnoiserecordings.com">{{cite web|title=Top 50 by Nirvana [MIXTAPE]|url=http://www.joyfulnoiserecordings.com/journal/top-50-by-nirvana/|access-date=8 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Nirvana: The Complete Illustrated History |last=Cross, Gaar, Gendron, Martens, Yarm |year= 2013 |isbn= 978-0-7603-4521-4 |page= 68}}</ref>

===1994–present===
O'Loughlin persuaded Birch and da Silva to play a show at [[The Garage, London|The Garage]] in London in March 1994 with [[Steve Shelley]] (Sonic Youth) on drums and Anne Wood on [[violin]] to celebrate the album re-releases. They recorded a session for [[BBC Radio 1]]'s [[John Peel]], which was released as ''Extended Play'' on Paul Smith's [[Blast First]] and Shelley's label [[Smells Like Records]]. Cobain invited them to play on Nirvana's planned UK tour in April, but he died a week before the tour began. The Raincoats released ''[[Looking in the Shadows]]'' on Rough Trade/[[Geffen Records|Geffen]] in 1996, produced by [[Britpop]] [[record producer|producer]] [[Ed Buller]] (who had previously worked with [[Suede (band)|Suede]] and [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]]). Musicians included Wood (violin, bass), Heather Dunn (drums) and [[Pete Shelley]] ([[Buzzcocks]]).

In 1995, the [[Tim/Kerr]] label released a Raincoats compilation, ''Fairytales''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/The-Raincoats-Fairytales/release/1234500|title=The Raincoats - Fairytales|website=Discogs|access-date=22 April 2018}}</ref>

Since 1996, the Raincoats have played some special events such as Wyatt's [[Meltdown (festival)|Meltdown]] in 2001, and [[Chicks on Speed]]'s ''99 Cents'' album release party in Berlin in December 2003. Birch and da Silva recorded a [[cover version]] of "Monk Chant" for a tribute album of [[the Monks|Monks]] songs called ''[[Silver Monk Time]]'', and performed the song live with the Monks at Berlin's [[Volksbühne]] in October 2006. They played at [[Ladyfest]] in [[Leeds]] in April 2007, and the [[Nuits Sonores]] Festival in [[Lyon]] on 18 May 2007. On 28 March 2009, ''The Raincoats-Fairytales-A Work in Progress'', directed by Birch and produced by the Raincoats, was screened at the [[British Film Institute]] in London. On 25 April, the band performed at [[Donaufestival]] in Austria.

On 9 November 2009, the Raincoats' debut album was reissued on vinyl on We ThRee (the band's own label) in the UK and on the [[Kill Rock Stars]] label in the U.S.

The band performed at [[Matt Groening]]'s [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] festival in May 2010 at [[Minehead]] in [[Somerset]]. The following week, the Raincoats played their debut album live for an ATP [[Don't Look Back (concert series)|Don't Look Back]] concert at London's [[Scala (club)|Scala]], supported by the Raincoats-influenced band Trash Kit. On 21 November 2010, the Raincoats performed a concert as part of the PopRally series at [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] in New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg3UN7nYpJM |title=The Raincoats – Feminist Song (MoMA) |publisher=YouTube |date=23 November 2010 |access-date=19 February 2012}}</ref> The band were invited by [[Jeff Mangum]] of [[Neutral Milk Hotel]] to perform their debut album live at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival in March 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpfestival.com/events/jeffmangum.php |title=ATP curated by Jeff Mangum |publisher=Atpfestival.com |access-date=19 February 2012}}</ref> In December 2011, it was announced that The Raincoats would also appear at the [[35 Conferette|35 Denton]] music festival in Texas the same month.
 
The Raincoats invited [[Angel Olsen]] to collaborate for the 40th anniversary of Rough Trade at London's [[Islington Assembly Hall]] on 3 November 2016.

On 5 October 2017, Jenn Pelly's [[33⅓]] book ''The Raincoats'', about the band's first album, was published by [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]].
