==Early life==
Hawk was born in Edinburgh, Scotland and grew up in the district of [[Fairmilehead]]. His father is a former [[graphic designer]] from [[New Zealand]], and her mother worked as a [[midwife]] and later as a postmistress. Hawk has two older siblings, a sister and a brother. His interest in performing and songwriting started as a child: "from an early age whatever I was going to do it had to involve a stage. I was into acting at school and applied for drama school. And didn’t get in, thankfully." He first started writing songs at age 14.<ref>{{cite web|title=haverin' PRESENTS Hamish Hawk|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZmmUU9GLmw|website=[[YouTube]]|access-date=9 October 2021}}</ref> Hawk went to study [[International relations|International Relations]] at the [[University of St Andrews]]; whilst he was there he started playing gigs. Hawk met musician [[King Creosote]] (Kenny Anderson) when he performed at the university, and after the gig gave him a CD of his songs, recalling: "About 45 minutes later, he emailed me and said, ‘[...] I’ve listened to it twice and I love it. What are you going to do with it?’ I said, ‘I don’t know.’ And he said, ‘What are ''we'' going to do with it?’".<ref>{{cite news|last=Jamieson |first=Teddy |title=Hamish Hawk: Scottish singer could be the next big thing|url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/19567026.hamish-hawk-scottish-singer-next-big-thing/|website=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]|date=11 September 2021|access-date= 9 October 2021}}</ref>

==Career==
After a while Anderson became a mentor, and asked Hawk to support him on several occasion through the Kingdom of Fife. Anderson would later also be involved in the release of Hawk's first vinyl record, ''Aznavour''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jamieson |first=Teddy |title=Hamish Hawk: Scottish singer could be the next big thing|url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/19567026.hamish-hawk-scottish-singer-next-big-thing/|website=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]|date=11 September 2021|access-date= 9 October 2021}}</ref> ''Aznavour'' was independently released in 2014, and was quickly followed by Hawk's first release on [[King Creosote]]'s Alter Ego Trading Company imprint, ''Mull'', in 2015. Three of the four songs on the EP would be re-recorded to feature on Hamish Hawk & The New Outfit's ''From Zero to One''.

===Hamish Hawk & The New Outfit===
In 2015, as means of bolstering his live performances, Hawk formed backing band the New Outfit, composed of guitarist Andrew Pearson, bassist Alex Duthie, drummer Barry Carty, and keyboard player John Cashman.<ref>{{cite news|last=Corcoran |first=Emma |title=Sunday Sessions 2 - Hamish Hawk|url=https://www.st-artmagazine.com/musicblog/2015/12/13/sunday-sessions-2-hamish-hawk |website=Start Magazine|date=13 December 2015|access-date= 9 October 2021}}</ref> Hawk would write the songs and later present them to the rest of the band: "I’ll come up with the words and basic structure for a song and bash it about a bit until I’m confident it has legs. After that, I’ll get the band involved and usually it sprouts all kinds of other limbs. It’s important for any song to be able to work on a solo level." In 2018, they released ''From Zero to One'' on Assai Recordings. The record was well received by critics.

===Heavy Elevator===
Following the release of ''Laziest River'' in 2019, Hawk started work on a new record. ''Heavy Elevator'' was recorded in September, 2019, over two weeks at Rod Jones's Post Electric Studio in Leith, Edinburgh. <ref>{{cite news|last=McKeown |first=Rory |title=Hamish Hawk interview: Edinburgh storyteller on creation of spellbinding new album Heavy Elevator|url=https://www.dailystar.co.uk/music/hamish-hawk-interview-edinburgh-storyteller-25012433|website=The Daily Star|date=17 September 2021|access-date= 21 November 2021}}</ref> Hawk composed the songs with New Outfit guitarist Andrew Pearson and ''Laziest River'' multi-instrumentalist Stefan Maurice. Hawk felt his songs became "bigger and bolder and more fully formed."<ref>{{cite news|last=Jamieson |first=Teddy |title=Hamish Hawk: Scottish singer could be the next big thing|url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/19567026.hamish-hawk-scottish-singer-next-big-thing/|website=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]|date=11 September 2021|access-date= 9 October 2021}}</ref> Recording continued through the [[COVID-19 pandemic|pandemic]], "... the band and I completely rallied and were sending demos back and forth, doing a lot of writing. There was this purple patch in the middle of last year, summertime, where we were constantly writing." Hawk said of this period.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jamieson |first=Teddy |title=on lockdown and creativity|url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/19572113.hamish-hawk-lockdown-creativity/|website=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]|date=10 September 2021|access-date= 21 November 2021}}</ref> ''Heavy Elevator'' was released on 17 September, 2021.
