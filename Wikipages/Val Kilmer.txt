==Career==

===1980s===
In 1981, while at Juilliard, Kilmer co-authored and starred in the play ''How It All Began,''<ref name="how">{{cite web |title=Val Kilmer Biography (1959–) |url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/15/Val-Kilmer.html |access-date=February 18, 2008}}</ref> which was performed at the [[Public Theater]] at the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]].

That same year, his first off-stage acting role (excluding television commercials) came in the form of an episode of ''[[ABC Afterschool Special]]'' called ''One Too Many'', which was an educational drama on drinking and driving;<ref name="onetoo">{{cite web |publisher=RetroJunk |title=Val Kilmer |url=http://www.retrojunk.com/details_person/4/ |access-date=May 11, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212092335/http://www.retrojunk.com/details_person/4/ |archive-date=February 12, 2009 }}</ref> it also starred a young [[Michelle Pfeiffer]]. Also in 1983, Kilmer self-published a collection of his own poetry entitled ''My Edens After Burns,'' that included poems inspired by his time with Pfeiffer. The book of poems is difficult to obtain, and expensive; even second-hand copies fetch $300 and up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bookride.com/2007/02/my-edens-after-burns-val-kilmer.html|title=Bookride|author=Bookride}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thespiannet.com/actors/K/kilmer_val/index.shtml|title=VAL KILMER at THESPIAN NET|author=K.

His big break came when he received top billing in the comedy spoof of spy movies ''[[Top Secret!]],'' in which he played an American rock and roll star. Kilmer sang all the songs in the film and released an album under the film character's name, "Nick Rivers".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.moviestalk.com/legendary-actors-and-actresses-revisited-val-kilmer/|title=Legendary Actors And Actresses Revisited – Val Kilmer – Movies Talk|date=September 11, 2015|work=Movies Talk|access-date=July 19, 2017}}</ref> While garnering more substantial roles and prestige, he also gained a reputation as a ladies' man, dating numerous women, some many years older, including [[Cher]] and [[Ellen Barkin]].<ref name="movies.yahoo.com"/>

During a brief hiatus, he backpacked throughout Europe before going on to play the lead character in the 1985 comedy ''[[Real Genius]]''. He turned down a role in [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]''<ref name="velvet">{{cite web |publisher=ContactMusic |title=Kilmer's Regret over Early Decisions |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/kilmers%20regret%20over%20early%20decisions |access-date=May 11, 2006|date=November 2, 2005 }}</ref> before being cast as naval aviator "Iceman" in the action film ''[[Top Gun]]'' alongside [[Tom Cruise]]. ''Top Gun'' grossed a total of $344,700,000 worldwide and made Kilmer a major star.<ref name="tgun">{{cite web |publisher=The Numbers.com |title=Top Gun |url=https://the-numbers.com/movies/1986/0TGUN.html |access-date=May 11, 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20051204002034/http://the-numbers.com/movies/1986/0TGUN.html<!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = December 4, 2005}}</ref> Following roles in the television films ''[[The Murders in the Rue Morgue]]'' and ''The Man Who Broke 1,000 Chains,'' Kilmer played [[Madmartigan]] in the fantasy ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]];'' he met his future wife, co-star [[Joanne Whalley]], on the film's set. Kilmer starred in the [[Colorado Shakespeare Festival]] production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' in 1988. In 1989, Kilmer played the lead in both ''[[Kill Me Again]],'' again opposite Whalley, and in [[Turner Network Television|TNT]]'s ''[[Billy the Kid (1989 film)|Billy the Kid]].''

===1990s===
====1990–1995====
After several delays, director [[Oliver Stone]] finally started production on the film ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'', based on the band of the same name. Kilmer spoke with Oliver Stone early on, concerned about what he might want to do with the story because Kilmer did not believe in or want to promote substance abuse. Kilmer saw Morrison as having picked the wrong heroes, who had different issues, which were not part of the creativity or inspiration. Kilmer saw Morrison's story as one that could be told "a thousand different ways" and did not want to tell it by playing the role in the style of drugs, with which Oliver Stone agreed.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}} Kilmer memorized the lyrics to all of lead singer [[Jim Morrison]]'s songs prior to his audition and sent a video of himself performing some Doors songs to director Stone. Stone was not impressed with the tape, but [[Paul Rothchild]] (the original producer of The Doors) said "I was shaken by it" and suggested they record Kilmer in the studio. After Kilmer was cast as Morrison, he prepared for the role by attending Doors tribute concerts and reading Morrison's poetry.<ref name="doors">{{cite web |publisher=Alexander-the-great.co.uk |title=Val Kilmer |url=http://www.alexander-the-great.co.uk/val_kilmer.htm |access-date=May 12, 2006}}</ref>

He spent close to a year before production dressing in Morrison-like clothes, and spent time at Morrison's old hangouts along the [[Sunset Strip]]. His portrayal of Morrison was praised and members of The Doors noted that Kilmer did such a convincing job that they had trouble distinguishing his voice from Morrison's. Paul Rothchild played Kilmer's version of "[[The End (The Doors)|The End]]" for the band's guitarist, [[Robby Krieger]], who told him, "I'm really glad they got 'The End'. We never got a recording of that live with Jim and now we've got it." However, Doors keyboardist [[Ray Manzarek]] was less than enthusiastic with how Morrison was portrayed in Stone's interpretation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Manzarek|first=Ray|title=Light My Fire: My Life With The Doors|year=1998|publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-399-14399-8|pages=251–252}}</ref>

In the early 1990s, Kilmer starred in the mystery thriller ''[[Thunderheart]]'', the action comedy ''[[The Real McCoy (film)|The Real McCoy]]'', and again teamed with ''Top Gun'' director [[Tony Scott]] to play [[Elvis Presley]] in ''[[True Romance]]'', which was written by [[Quentin Tarantino]]. In 1993, Kilmer played [[Doc Holliday]] in the western ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]'' alongside [[Kurt Russell]]. In the film, Doc Holliday performs [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]]'s [[Nocturne in E minor, Op. posth. 72 (Chopin)|Nocturne in E minor, Op.72, No. 1]]; however, Kilmer does not play the piano and he practised that one piece for months in preparation.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieDetails/comments/6khnpl/did_you_know_that_the_only_piano_i_play_is_about |title= Movie Details Subreddit |last= Kilmer |first= Val |date= July 2017 |website= Reddit |access-date= June 20, 2018 }}</ref> In 1995, Kilmer starred in ''[[Wings of Courage]]'', a 3D [[IMAX]] film, and that same year, he starred opposite [[Al Pacino]] and [[Robert De Niro]] in ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]'', which is now considered one of the best crime/drama films of the 1990s.<ref name="heatrot">{{cite web |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |title=Heat (1995) |url=https://rottentomatoes.com/m/1068182-heat/ |access-date=May 11, 2006}}</ref>

====Batman====
In December 1993 ''[[Batman Forever]]'' director [[Joel Schumacher]] had seen ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]'' and was most impressed with Kilmer's performance as [[Doc Holliday]]. Schumacher felt him to be perfect for the role of [[Bruce Wayne (1989 film series character)|Batman]], though at the time, the role was still [[Michael Keaton]]'s.<ref name="hold">{{cite news |last=Nathan |first=Ian |title=Hold me, thrill me, kiss me, Kilmer |work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |pages=108–117 |date=August 1995}}</ref> In July 1994, Keaton decided not to return for a third Batman film after 1992's ''[[Batman Returns]]'',<ref name="next">{{cite news |first=Jeff |last=Gordinier |title=Next at Batman |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=July 15, 1994 |url=https://ew.com/ew/article/0,,3|access-date=October 14, 2007}}</ref> due to "creative differences".<ref name="hold" /> [[William Baldwin]] (who previously worked with Schumacher on ''[[Flatliners]]'') was reported to be a top contender, though just days after Keaton dropped out, Kilmer was cast.<ref name="next" /> Kilmer took the role without even knowing who the new director was and without reading the script.<ref name="hold" />

Released in June 1995, ''Batman Forever'' was a success at the box office,<ref name="batman">{{cite web |publisher=The Numbers.com |title=Batman Forever |url=https://the-numbers.com/movies/1995/0BTM3.html |access-date=May 11, 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060508133948/http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1995/0BTM3.html<!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = May 8, 2006}}</ref> despite receiving mixed reviews from critics.<ref name="batmant">{{cite web |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |title=Batman Forever (1995) |url=https://rottentomatoes.com/m/batman_forever/ |access-date=May 11, 2006}}</ref> There was debate about Kilmer's performance: some critics, like ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} [[Janet Maslin]], thought Kilmer was a poor successor to Keaton in the part;<ref>{{cite news|first=Janet|last=Maslin|author-link=Janet Maslin|title=FILM REVIEW: BATMAN FOREVER; New Challenges for the Caped Crusader|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/16/movies/film-review-batman-forever-new-challenges-for-the-caped-crusader.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York City|date=June 16, 1995|access-date=November 2, 2018}}</ref> while others, such as [[Roger Ebert]], had kind words for Kilmer.<ref>{{cite news|first=Roger|last=Ebert|author-link=Roger Ebert|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/batman-forever-1995|title=Batman Forever|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=June 16, 1995|access-date=November 2, 2018|via=rogerebert.com}}</ref> ''Batman'' creator [[Bob Kane]] said in a ''[[Cinescape]]'' interview that of all the actors to have played Batman up to that point, he felt Kilmer had given the best interpretation. Film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] (who criticized the dark tone contained in ''Batman Returns'') complimented Kilmer's portrayal when he reviewed the film for his expanding collection of film reviews.<ref>{{cite book|first=Leonard|last=Maltin|author-link=Leonard Maltin|title=Leonard Maltin's 2009 Movie Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EgPDierNGUC&q=leonard+maltin+batman+forever&pg=PA92|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|location=New York City|date=2008|isbn=9780452289789|page=92}}</ref> Defenders of ''Batman Forever'' praised the film for portraying Batman as a more heroic, less ruthless, and more human character than in the Tim Burton films. The film also brought the film interpretation of Bruce Wayne more into line with his comic book counterpart, showing him as a socialite and a very public figure rather than the neurotic recluse of the previous films.

In February 1996, Kilmer decided not to return for another Batman feature film, feeling that Batman was being marginalized in favor of the villains<ref name="Daly">{{cite news |title=A Tights Squeeze |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=March 8, 1996 |url= https://ew.com/ew/article/0,,291605,00.html |access-date=September 17, 2007 |first1=Steve |last1=Daly |first2=Anne |last2=Thompson}}</ref> and because of scheduling problems with ''[[The Saint (1997 film)|The Saint]]''. [[George Clooney]] replaced Kilmer as Batman in 1997's ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]''.

That year, Kilmer starred alongside [[Michael Douglas]] in the thriller ''[[The Ghost and the Darkness]]''. In 1997 he played [[Simon Templar]] in the popular action film, ''[[The Saint (1997 film)|The Saint]]''. Kilmer looked forward to the title role as a change toward a more fun, less serious action thriller, while enjoying the "master of disguise" chameleon characters like a mad artist, a nerdy British scientist, a cleaner, and a Russian mob boss. Kilmer also wrote the poetry in the film.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} He received a salary of $6&nbsp;million for the movie.<ref name="Daly"/> ''The Saint'' was a financial success, grossing $169.4&nbsp;million worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Saint-The|title=The Saint (1997) - Financial Information|website=The Numbers}}</ref>

In 1998, he voiced [[Moses]] in the animated film ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'', before starring in the [[independent film]] ''[[Joe the King]]'' (1999).
