The '''German nuclear weapons program''' ({{lang-de|Uranprojekt}}; informally known as the '''Uranverein'''; {{lang-en|“Uranium Project”}}) was an unsuccessful scientific effort led by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] to research and develop [[nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] during [[World War&nbsp;II]]. It went through several phases of work, but in the words of a historian{{Who|date=January 2021}}, it was ultimately "frozen at the laboratory level" with the "modest goal" to "build a nuclear reactor which could sustain a nuclear fission chain reaction for a significant amount of time and to achieve the complete separation of at least tiny amount of the uranium isotopes." The scholarly consensus is that it failed to achieve these goals.{{sfn|Walker|1995|pp= 198-9}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Grasso|first=Giacomo|last2=Oppici|first2=Carlo|last3=Rocchi|first3=Federico|last4=Sumini|first4=Marco|date=2009|title=A Neutronics Study of the 1945 Haigerloch B-VIII Nuclear Reactor|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00016-008-0396-0|journal=Physics in Perspective|language=en|volume=11|issue=3|pages=318–335|doi=10.1007/s00016-008-0396-0|issn=1422-6944}}</ref>

The first effort started in April 1939, just months after the discovery of [[nuclear fission]] in December 1938, but ended only months later shortly ahead of the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion of Poland]], when many notable physicists were drafted into the ''[[Wehrmacht]]''.

A second effort began under the administrative purview of the ''Wehrmacht's '' [[Waffenamt|''Heereswaffenamt'']] on 1 September 1939, the day of the invasion of Poland. The program eventually expanded into three main efforts: the ''Uranmaschine'' ([[nuclear reactor]]), uranium and [[heavy water]] production, and uranium [[isotope separation]]. Eventually it was assessed that nuclear fission would not contribute significantly to ending the war, and in January 1942, the ''Heereswaffenamt'' turned the program over to the [[Reichsforschungsrat|Reich Research Council]] (''Reichsforschungsrat'') while continuing to fund the program. The program was split up among nine major institutes where the directors dominated the research and set their own objectives. Subsequently, the number of scientists working on applied nuclear fission began to diminish, with many applying their talents to more pressing war-time demands.

The most influential people in the ''Uranverein'' were [[Kurt Diebner]], [[Abraham Esau]], [[Walther Gerlach]], and [[Erich Schumann]]; Schumann was one of the most powerful and influential physicists in Germany. Diebner, throughout the life of the nuclear weapon project, had more control over nuclear fission research than did [[Walther Bothe]], [[Klaus Clusius]], [[Otto Hahn]], [[Paul Harteck]], or [[Werner Heisenberg]]. Abraham Esau was appointed as [[Reichsmarschall]] [[Hermann Göring]]'s plenipotentiary for nuclear physics research in December 1942; Walther Gerlach succeeded him in December 1943.

Politicization of the German [[academia]] under the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime had driven many physicists, engineers, and mathematicians out of Germany as early as 1933. Those of Jewish heritage who did not leave were quickly purged from German institutions, further thinning the ranks of academia. The politicization of the universities, along with the demands for manpower by the German armed forces (many scientists and technical personnel were conscripted, despite possessing technical and engineering skills), substantially reduced the number of able German physicists.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Judt | first = Matthias |author2=Burghard Ciesla | title = Technology transfer out of Germany after 1945 | publisher=Routledge | year = 1996 | page = 55 | isbn = 978-3-7186-5822-0}}</ref>

At the end of the war, the Allied powers competed to obtain surviving components of the nuclear industry (personnel, facilities, and [[materiel]]), as they did with the pioneering [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] [[SRBM]] program.

==Discovery of nuclear fission==
{{Main|Discovery of nuclear fission}}

In December 1938, German chemist [[Otto Hahn]] and his assistant [[Fritz Strassmann]] sent a manuscript to the German science journal ''[[Die Naturwissenschaften|Naturwissenschaften]]'' ("Natural Sciences") reporting that they had detected and identified the element [[barium]] after bombarding [[uranium]] with [[neutrons]].<ref>O. Hahn and F. Strassmann ''Über den Nachweis und das Verhalten der bei der Bestrahlung des Urans mittels Neutronen entstehenden Erdalkalimetalle'' (''On the detection and characteristics of the alkaline earth metals formed by irradiation of uranium with neutrons''), ''Naturwissenschaften'' Volume 27, Number 1, 11–15 (1939). The authors were identified as associated with the ''Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Chemie'', Berlin-Dahlem. Received 22 December 1938.</ref> Their article was published on 6 January 1939. On 19 December 1938, eighteen days before the publication, Otto Hahn communicated these results and his conclusion of a ''bursting'' of the uranium nucleus in a letter to his colleague and friend [[Lise Meitner]], who had fled Germany in July to the Netherlands and then to Sweden.<ref>Ruth Lewin Sime ''Lise Meitner's Escape from Germany'', ''American Journal of Physics'' Volume 58, Number 3, 263–267 (1990).</ref> Meitner and her nephew [[Otto Robert Frisch]] confirmed Hahn's conclusion of a ''bursting'' and correctly interpreted the results as "[[nuclear fission]]" – a term coined by Frisch.<ref>Lise Meitner and O.

==First ''Uranverein''==
On 22 April 1939, after hearing a colloquium paper by [[Wilhelm Hanle]] proposing the use of [[uranium]] [[nuclear fission|fission]] in a ''Uranmaschine'' (uranium machine, i.e., [[nuclear reactor]]), [[Georg Joos]], along with Hanle, notified Wilhelm Dames, at the ''[[Reichserziehungsministerium]]'' (REM, Reich Ministry of Education), of potential military applications of nuclear energy. The group included the physicists [[Walther Bothe]], [[Robert Döpel]], [[Hans Geiger]], [[Wolfgang Gentner]] (probably sent by [[Walther Bothe]]), [[Wilhelm Hanle]], [[Gerhard Hoffmann]], and [[Georg Joos]]; [[Peter Debye]] was invited, but he did not attend. After this, informal work began at the [[University of Göttingen|Georg-August University of Göttingen]] by Joos, Hanle, and their colleague [[Reinhold Mannkopff]]; the group of physicists was known informally as the first ''Uranverein'' (Uranium Club) and formally as ''Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Kernphysik''. The group's work was discontinued in August 1939, when the three were called to military training.{{sfn|Kant|2002|loc=Reference 8 on p. 3}}{{sfn|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|loc=p. 363-4 and Appendix F; see the entries for Esau, Harteck and Joos.

==Other 1939 initiatives==
[[Paul Harteck]] was director of the physical chemistry department at the [[University of Hamburg]] and an advisor to the ''[[Heereswaffenamt]]'' (HWA, Army Ordnance Office). On 24 April 1939, along with his teaching assistant [[Wilhelm Groth]], Harteck made contact with the ''Reichskriegsministerium'' (RKM, Reich Ministry of War) to alert them to the potential of military applications of nuclear chain reactions. This initiative led, later in the year, to the Second ''Uranverein''. Two days earlier, Joos and Hanle had approached the REM, leading to the First Uranverein.

The industrial firm ''[[Auergesellschaft]]'' had a substantial amount of "waste" [[uranium]] from which it had extracted [[radium]]. After reading a June 1939 paper by [[Siegfried Flügge]], on the technical use of nuclear energy from uranium,<ref>Siegfried Flügge ''Kann der Energieinhalt der Atomkerne technisch nutzbar gemacht werden?'', [[Die Naturwissenschaften]] Volume 27, Issues 23/24, 402–10 (9 June 1939).</ref><ref>Also see: Siegfried Flügge ''Die Ausnutzung der Atomenergie.

From the Laboratory Experiment to the Uranium Machine&nbsp;– Research Results in Dahlem [15 August 1939]'' in {{harvnb|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|pp=197–206}}. [This article is Flügge's popularized version of the June 1939 article in ''Die Naturwissenschaften''.]</ref> [[Nikolaus Riehl]], the head of the scientific headquarters at Auergesellschaft, recognized a business opportunity for the company, and in July he went to the HWA (''Heereswaffenamt'', Army Ordnance Office) to discuss the production of uranium. The HWA was interested and Riehl committed corporate resources to the task. The HWA eventually provided an order for the production of uranium oxide, which took place in the Auergesellschaft plant in [[Oranienburg]], north of Berlin.{{sfn|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|loc=p. 369, Appendix F, see the entry for Riehl, and Appendix D, see the entry for Auergesellschaft}}{{sfn|Riehl|Seitz|1996|p=13}}

==Second ''Uranverein''==
[[File:Atomreaktor Museum Stadtilm.jpg|thumb|''Atomkeller'' in [[Stadtilm]]]] 
The second ''Uranverein'' began after the HWA squeezed out the ''Reichsforschungsrat'' (RFR, Reich Research Council) of the REM and started the formal German nuclear weapons project under military auspices. This second ''Uranverein'' was formed on 1 September 1939, the day World War II began, and had its first meeting on 16 September 1939. The meeting was organized by [[Kurt Diebner]], advisor to the HWA, and held in Berlin. The invitees included [[Walther Bothe]], [[Siegfried Flügge]], [[Hans Geiger]], [[Otto Hahn]], [[Paul Harteck]], [[Gerhard Hoffmann]], [[Josef Mattauch]], and [[Georg Stetter]]. A second meeting was held soon thereafter and included [[Klaus Clusius]], [[Robert Döpel]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], and [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]]. Also at this time, the ''Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für Physik'' (KWIP, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, after World War II the [[Max Planck Institute for Physics]]), in [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Berlin-Dahlem]], was placed under HWA authority, with Diebner as the administrative director, and the military control of the nuclear research commenced.<ref name=Macrakis1993/><ref name=Mehra_Rechenberg_01/>{{sfn|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|loc=pp. 363–4 and Appendix F; see the entries for Diebner and Döpel. See also the entry for the KWIP in Appendix A and the entry for the HWA in Appendix B}}

Heisenberg said in 1939 that the physicists at the (second) meeting said that "in principle atomic bombs could be made.... it would take years.... not before five." He said, "I didn't report it to the [[Führer]] until two weeks later and very casually because I did not want the Führer to get so interested that he would order great efforts immediately to make the atomic bomb. [[Albert Speer|Speer]] felt it was better that the whole thing should be dropped and the Führer also reacted that way." He said they presented the matter in this way for their personal safety as the probability (of success) was nearly zero, but if many thousands (of) people developed nothing, that could have "extremely disagreeable consequences for us."{{sfn| Ermenc|1989|p=34}} So we turned the slogan around to ''make use of warfare for physics'' not "make use of physics for warfare."{{sfn| Ermenc|1989|p=23}} [[Erhard Milch]] asked how long America would take and was told 1944 though the group ''between ourselves'' thought it would take longer, three or four years.{{sfn| Ermenc|1989|p=27}}

When it was apparent that the nuclear weapon project would not make a decisive contribution to ending the war in the near term, control of the KWIP was returned in January 1942 to its umbrella organization, the ''[[Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft]]'' (KWG, Kaiser Wilhelm Society, after World War II the [[Max Planck Society|Max-Planck Gesellschaft]]). HWA control of the project was subsequently passed to the RFR in July 1942. The nuclear weapon project thereafter maintained its ''kriegswichtig'' (war importance) designation, and funding continued from the military, but it was then split into the areas of [[uranium]] and [[heavy water]] production, uranium isotope separation, and the ''Uranmaschine'' (uranium machine, i.e., nuclear reactor). It was in effect broken up between institutes where the different directors dominated the research and set their own research agendas.<ref name=Macrakis1993/>{{sfn|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|loc=See the entry for the KWIP in Appendix A and the entries for the HWA and the RFR in Appendix B.

The point in 1942 when the army relinquished control of the project was its zenith in terms of the number of personnel devoted to the effort, and this was no more than about seventy scientists, with about forty devoting more than half their time to nuclear fission research. After this the number diminished dramatically, and many of those not working with the main institutes stopped working on nuclear fission and devoted their efforts to more pressing war related work.{{sfn|Walker|1993|loc=p. 52 and Reference n. 40 on p. 262}}

On 4 June 1942, a conference regarding the project, initiated by [[Albert Speer]] as head of the "Reich Ministry for Armament and Ammunition" (RMBM: '' Reichsministerium für Bewaffnung und Munition''; after late 1943 the Reich Ministry for Armament and War Production), decided on its continuation merely for the aim of energy production.{{sfn|Hanle|Rechenberg|1982|}} On 9 June 1942, [[Adolf Hitler]] issued a decree for the reorganization of the RFR as a separate legal entity under the RMBM; the decree appointed Reich Marshal [[Hermann Göring]] as its president.<ref>Document 98: ''The Führer's Decree on the Reich Research Council'', 9 June 1942, in {{harvnb|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|p=303}}.</ref> The reorganization was done under the initiative of Minister [[Albert Speer]] of the RMBM; it was necessary as the RFR under [[Bernhard Rust]] the Minister of Science, Education and National Culture was ineffective and was not achieving its purpose.<ref>Read [[Samuel Abraham Goudsmit|Samuel Goudsmit's]] account and interpretation of the role of the RFR in Document 111: ''War Physics in Germany'', January 1946, in {{harvnb|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|pp=345–52}}.</ref> The hope was that Göring would manage the RFR with the same discipline and efficiency as he had the aviation sector. A meeting was held on 6 July 1942 to discuss the function of the RFR and set its agenda. The meeting was a turning point in National Socialism's attitude towards science, as well as recognition that the policies which drove Jewish scientists out of Germany were a mistake, as the Reich needed their expertise. [[Abraham Esau]] was appointed on 8 December 1942 as [[Hermann Göring|Hermann Göring's]] ''Bevollmächtigter'' (plenipotentiary) for nuclear physics research under the RFR; in December 1943, Esau was replaced by [[Walther Gerlach]]. In the final analysis, placing the RFR under Göring's administrative control had little effect on the German nuclear weapon project.<ref name=Council42>Document 99: ''Record of Conference Regarding the Reich Research Council'', 6 July 1942, in {{harvnb|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|loc=pp. 304–8}}.</ref>{{sfn|Macrakis|1993|pp=91–4}}{{sfn|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|loc=Appendix F; see the entries for Esau and Gerlach}}{{sfn|Walker|1993|p=86}}

Speer states that the project to develop the atom bomb was scuttled in the autumn of 1942. Though the scientific solution was there, it would have taken all of Germany's production resources to produce a bomb, and then no sooner than 1947.<ref name=Speer1995>{{cite book |last1=Speer |first1=Albert |title=Inside the Third Reich |date=1995 |location=London |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |isbn=9781842127353 |pages=314–20 }}</ref> Development did continue with a "uranium motor" for the navy and development of a German [[cyclotron]]. However, by the summer of 1943, Speer released the remaining 1200 [[metric ton]]s of uranium stock for the production of solid-core ammunition.<ref name=Speer1995/>

Over time, the HWA and then the RFR controlled the German nuclear weapon project. The most influential people were [[Kurt Diebner]], [[Abraham Esau]], [[Walther Gerlach]], and [[Erich Schumann]]. Schumann was one of the most powerful and influential physicists in Germany. He was director of the Physics Department II at the Frederick William University (later, University of Berlin), which was commissioned and funded by the ''Oberkommando des Heeres'' (OKH, Army High Command) to conduct physics research projects. He was also head of the research department of the HWA, assistant secretary of the Science Department of the OKW, and ''Bevollmächtigter'' (plenipotentiary) for high explosives. Diebner, throughout the life of the nuclear weapon project, had more control over nuclear fission research than did [[Walther Bothe]], [[Klaus Clusius]], Otto Hahn, [[Paul Harteck]], or Werner Heisenberg.{{sfn|Walker|1993|p=208}}{{sfn|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|loc=Appendix F; see the entry for Schumann. Also see footnote 1 on p. 207}}

==Isotope separation==
[[Paul Peter Ewald]], a member of the ''Uranverein'', had proposed an [[Isotope separation#Electromagnetic|electromagnetic isotope separator]], which was thought applicable to <sup>235</sup>U production and enrichment. This was picked up by [[Manfred von Ardenne]], who ran a private research establishment.

In 1928, von Ardenne had come into his inheritance with full control as to how it could be spent, and he established his private research laboratory the ''Forschungslaboratorium für Elektronenphysik'',<ref>{{cite news |date=20 January 2006 |title=Zur Ehrung von Manfred von Ardenne |publisher=sachsen.de |url=http://www.sachsen.de/sadra/887.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325042138/http://www.sachsen.de/sadra/887.htm |archive-date=25 March 2008}}</ref> in Berlin-Lichterfelde, to conduct his own research on radio and television technology and [[electron microscopy]]. He financed the laboratory with income he received from his inventions and from contracts with other concerns. For example, his research on nuclear physics and high-frequency technology was financed by the ''[[Reichspostministerium]]'' (RPM, Reich Postal Ministry), headed by [[Wilhelm Ohnesorge]]. Von Ardenne attracted top-notch personnel to work in his facility, such as the nuclear physicist [[Fritz Houtermans]], in 1940. Von Ardenne had also conducted research on isotope separation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Manfred Baron von Ardenne 1907–1997 |website= Lemo – Lebendiges Museum Online |url=http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/biografien/ArdenneManfred/ }}</ref>{{sfn|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|loc=Appendix F; see entry for Ardenne. Also see the entry for the ''Reichspostministerium'' in Appendix C}} Taking Ewald's suggestion he began building a prototype for the RPM. The work was hampered by war shortages and ultimately ended by the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Walker|1993|loc=pp. 83–84, 170, 183, and Reference n. 85 on p. 247}}.

Aside from the ''Uranverein'' and von Ardenne's team in Berlin-Lichterfelde, there was also a small research team in the ''Henschel Flugzeugwerke'': the study group under the direction of Prof. Dr. Ing. Herbert Wagner (1900–1982) searched for alternative sources of energy for airplanes and became interested in nuclear energy in 1940. In August 1941, they finished a detailed internal survey of the history and potential of technical nuclear physics and its applications (''Übersicht und Darstellung der historischen Entwicklung der modernen technischen Kernphysik und deren Anwendungsmöglichkeit sowie Zusammenfassung eigener Arbeitsziele und Pläne'', signed by Herbert Wagner and Hugo Watzlawek (1912–1995) in Berlin. Their application to the Aviation Ministry (RLM) to found and fund an Institute for Nuclear Technology and Nuclear Chemistry (''Reichsinstituts für Kerntechnik und Kernchemie'') failed, but Watzlawek continued to explore potential applications of nuclear energy and wrote a detailed textbook on technical nuclear physics. It includes one of the most detailed presentations of contemporary German knowledge about the various processes of isotope separation, and recommends their combined usage to get to sufficient amounts of enriched uranium. Walther Gerlach refused to print this textbook, but it is preserved as a typed manuscript and it appeared after the War in 1948 virtually unchanged (with just a few additions on the US atomic bomb released in 1945).<ref>See {{cite book |last=Watzlawek |first=Hugo |year=1948 |title=Lehrbuch der technischen Kernphysik |publisher=Deuticke}}; the original typescript is available in the online-Archive of the Deutsches Museum München at https://digital.deutsches-museum.de/item/FA-002-752/</ref> In October 1944, Hugo Watzlawek wrote an article on the potential usage of nuclear energy and its many potential applications. In his view, to follow up this route of research and development was the "new pathway" to becoming the "Master of the World".<ref>See {{cite journal |last=Hentschel |first=Klaus |date=2020 |title=''Der neue Weg'': Mit inneratomarer Energie zum ''Herrn der Welt'' werden – Zu einem bislang unbekannten Typoskript vom Oktober 1944 (Inneratomic Energy as the ''New Path'' Towards Becoming ''Master of the World – On a Hitherto Unknown Typescript from October 1944 |journal=NTM Zeitschrift für Geschichte der Wissenschaften, Technik und Medizin |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=121–147 |doi=10.1007/s00048-020-00241-z |pmid=32415322 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00048-020-00241-z }}</ref> It is thus a mistake to focus only on the efforts of the ''Uranverein''—other research groups in Germany were also active in research to exploit nuclear energy, especially for military purposes.

==Moderator production==
The production of [[heavy water]] was already under way in Norway when the Germans invaded on 9 April 1940. The Norwegian production facilities for heavy water were quickly secured (though some heavy water had already been removed) and improved by the Germans. The Allies and Norwegians had [[Norwegian heavy water sabotage|sabotaged Norwegian heavy water production]] and destroyed stocks of heavy water by 1943.

Graphite (carbon) as an alternative was not considered, because the neutron absorption coefficient value for carbon calculated by [[Walther Bothe]] was too high, probably due to the boron in the graphite pieces having high neutron absorption.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bethe |first=Hans A. |author-link=Hans Bethe |year=2000 |title=The German Uranium Project |journal=Physics Today |volume=53 |issue=7 |pages=34–6 |doi=10.1063/1.1292473 |bibcode=2000PhT....53g..34B }}</ref>

Reports from the research conducted were published in ''[[Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte]]'' (''Research Reports in Nuclear Physics''), an internal publication of the ''Uranverein''. The reports were classified Top Secret, they had very limited distribution, and the authors were not allowed to keep copies. The reports were confiscated under the Allied [[Operation Alsos]] and sent to the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] for evaluation. In 1971, the reports were declassified and returned to Germany. The reports are available at the [[Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe|Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center]] and the [[American Institute of Physics]].{{sfn|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|loc=Appendix E; see the entry for ''Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte''}}{{sfn|Walker|1993|pp=268–74}}

==Politicization==
Two factors which had deleterious effects on the nuclear weapon project were the politicization of the education system under National Socialism and the rise of the ''[[Deutsche Physik]]'' movement, which was [[anti-Semitic]] and had a bias against [[theoretical physics]], especially [[quantum mechanics]].{{sfn|Beyerchen|1977|pp=123–40}}

===Emigrations===
Adolf Hitler [[Machtergreifung|took power on 30 January 1933]]. On 7 April, the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]] was enacted; this law, and its subsequent related ordinances, politicized the education system in Germany. This had immediate damaging effects on the physics capabilities of Germany.<!--citation: see next para --> Furthermore, combined with the ''Deutsche Physik'' movement, the damaging effects were intensified and prolonged. The consequences to physics in Germany and its subfield of nuclear physics were multifaceted.

An immediate consequence upon passage of the law was that it produced both quantitative and qualitative losses to the physics community. Numerically, it has been estimated that a total of 1,145 university teachers, in all fields, were driven from their posts, which represented about 14% of the higher learning institutional staff members in 1932–1933.{{sfn|Beyerchen|1977|p=44}} Out of 26 German nuclear physicists cited in the literature before 1933, 50% emigrated.{{sfn|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|loc=p. lviii}} Qualitatively, 11 physicists and four chemists who had won or would win the Nobel Prize emigrated from Germany shortly after Hitler came to power, most of them in 1933.{{sfn|Beyerchen|1977|p=48}} These 15 scientists were: [[Hans Bethe]], [[Felix Bloch]], [[Max Born]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[James Franck]], [[Heinrich Gerhard Kuhn]], [[Peter Debye]], [[Dennis Gabor]], [[Fritz Haber]], [[Gerhard Herzberg]], [[Victor Hess]], [[George de Hevesy]], [[Erwin Schrödinger]], [[Otto Stern]], and [[Eugene Wigner]].

[[Max Planck]], the father of [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], had been right in assessing the consequences of National Socialist policies. In 1933, Planck, as president of the ''[[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute|Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft]]'' (Kaiser Wilhelm Society), met with Adolf Hitler. During the meeting, Planck told Hitler that forcing Jewish scientists to emigrate would mutilate Germany and the benefits of their work would go to foreign countries. Hitler responded with a rant against Jews and Planck could only remain silent and then take his leave. The National Socialist regime would only come around to the same conclusion as Planck in the 6 July 1942 meeting regarding the future agenda of the ''Reichsforschungsrat'' (RFR, Reich Research Council), but by then it was too late.<ref name=Council42/><ref>Document 114: ''Max Planck: My Audience with Adolf Hitler'' in {{harvnb|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|pp=359–61}}.</ref>

===Heisenberg affair===
{{see also|Johannes Juilfs#The deutsche Physik movement & the Heisenberg Affair}}
The politicization of the education system essentially replaced academic tradition and excellence with ideological adherence and trappings, such as membership in National Socialist organizations including the ''[[Nazi Party|Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei]]'' (NSDAP, National Socialist German Workers Party), the ''Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Dozentenbund'' (NSDDB, [[National Socialist German Lecturers League]]), and the ''Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund'' (NSDStB, [[National Socialist German Students' League]]). The politicization can be illustrated with the conflict which evolved when a replacement for [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] was sought in view of his emeritus status. The conflict involved one of the prominent ''Uranverein'' participants, Werner Heisenberg.

On 1 April 1935, [[Arnold Sommerfeld]], Heisenberg's teacher and doctoral advisor at the [[University of Munich]], achieved emeritus status. However, Sommerfeld stayed on as his own temporary replacement during the selection process for his successor, which took until 1 December 1939. The process was lengthy due to academic and political differences between the Munich Faculty's selection and that of both the ''[[Reichserziehungsministerium]]'' (REM, Reich Education Ministry) and the supporters of ''[[Deutsche Physik]]''. In 1935, the Munich Faculty drew up a candidate list to replace Sommerfeld as ordinarius professor of theoretical physics and head of the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Munich. There were three names on the list: Werner Heisenberg, who received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1932, [[Peter Debye]], who would receive the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1936, and [[Richard Becker (physicist)|Richard Becker]]{{snd}}all former students of Sommerfeld. The Munich Faculty was firmly behind these candidates, with Heisenberg as their first choice. However, supporters of ''Deutsche Physik'' and elements in the REM had their own list of candidates and the battle commenced, dragging on for over four years.

During this time, Heisenberg came under vicious attack by the supporters of ''Deutsche Physik.'' One such attack was published in ''Das Schwarze Korps'', the newspaper of the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'', or SS, headed by [[Heinrich Himmler]]. Heisenberg had been lecturing to his students about the [[theory of relativity]], proposed by the Jewish scientist Albert Einstein. In the editorial, Himmler called Heisenberg a "White Jew" who should be made to "disappear."{{sfn|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|loc= see Document N. 55 '' 'White Jews' in Science [15 July 1937]'', pp. 152–57}} These verbal attacks were taken seriously, as Jews were subject to physical violence and incarceration at the time. Heisenberg fought back with an editorial and a letter to Himmler, in an attempt to get a resolution to this matter and regain his honour. At one point, Heisenberg's mother visited Himmler's mother to help bring a resolution to the affair. The two women knew each other as a result of Heisenberg's maternal grandfather and Himmler's father being rectors and members of a Bavarian hiking club. Eventually, Himmler settled the Heisenberg affair by sending two letters, one to ''SS-Gruppenführer'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]] and one to Heisenberg, both on 21 July 1938. In the letter to Heydrich, Himmler said Germany could not afford to lose or silence Heisenberg as he would be useful for teaching a generation of scientists. To Heisenberg, Himmler said the letter came on recommendation of his family and he cautioned Heisenberg to make a distinction between professional physics research results and the personal and political attitudes of the involved scientists. The letter to Heisenberg was signed under the closing "''Mit freundlichem Gruss und, Heil Hitler!''" ("With friendly greetings and, Heil Hitler!"){{sfn|Goudsmit|1986|pp=117–19}}

Overall, the settlement of the Heisenberg affair was a victory for academic standards and professionalism. However, the replacement of Sommerfeld by [[Wilhelm Müller (physicist)|Wilhelm Müller]] on 1 December 1939 was a victory of politics over academic standards. Müller was not a theoretical physicist, had not published in a physics journal, and was not a member of the ''[[Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft]]'' (DPG, German Physical Society); his appointment as a replacement for Sommerfeld was considered a travesty and detrimental to educating a new generation of theoretical physicists.{{sfn|Goudsmit|1986|pp=117–19}}{{sfn|Beyerchen|1977|pp=153–67}}{{sfn|Cassidy|1992|pp=383–87}}{{sfn|Powers|1993|pp=40–43}}{{sfn|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|loc= see Document n. 55 '' 'White Jews' in Science [15 July 1937]'', pp. 152–57; Document n. 63 ''Heinrich Himmler: Letter to Reinhard Heydrich [21 July 1938]'', pp. 175–76; Document n. 64 ''Heinrich Himmler: Letter to Werner Heisenberg [21 July 1938]'', pp. 176–77; Document n. 85 ''Ludwig Prandtl: Attachment to the letter to Reich Marschal (sic) Hermann Göring [28 April 1941]'', pp. 261–66; Document n. 93 ''[[Carl Ramsauer]]: The Munich Conciliation and Pacification Attempt 20 January 1942'', pp. 290–92}}

===Missing generation of physicists===
Politicization of the academic community, combined with the impact of the ''Deutsche Physik'' movement, and other policies such as drafting physicists to fight in the war, had the net effect of bringing about a missing generation of physicists. At the close of the war, physicists born between 1915 and 1925 were almost nonexistent.{{sfn|Walker|1993|pp=42–43, 80}} Those drafted included ''Uranverein'' members [[Paul O. Müller]] and [[Karl-Heinz Höcker]]. Müller died on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Russian front]], but Höcker was repatriated in poor health in 1942. They had the classification (''uk'') not (''uk'', indispensable) and not even [[Kurt Diebner]], managing director of the KWIP, could stop their call-up. It was not until 1944 that {{ill|Werner Osenberg|de|Werner Osenberg}}, head of the planning board at the ''[[Reichsforschungsrat]]'' (RFR, Reich Research Council), was able to initiate calling back 5000 engineers and scientists from the front to work on research categorized as ''kriegsentscheidend'' (decisive for the war effort). By the end of the war, the number recalled had reached 15,000.<ref>see Wikipedia articles on [[Paul O. Müller]] and [[Karl-Heinz Höcker]]</ref>

[[Paul Harteck]] said at the first meeting of the nuclear physicists that [[Gustav Hertz]] should be included "as he was one of the most clever experimenters I know", but he was not "100% Aryan" so could not work for the government (he worked for Siemens). Harteck believed that if Hertz had had a leading position "the first working reactor in the world would have been built in Germany, and perhaps the thermal diffusion process would have been achieved".{{sfn| Ermenc|1989|pp=112–13}}

===Autonomy and accommodation===
Members of the ''Uranverein'', [[Wolfgang Finkelnburg]], Werner Heisenberg, [[Carl Ramsauer]], and [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]] were effective in countering the politicization of academia and effectively putting an end to the influence of the ''Deutsche Physik'' movement. However, in order to do this they were, as were many scientists, caught between autonomy and accommodation.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2005|pp=293–329}} Essentially, they would have to legitimize the National Socialist system by compromise and collaboration.{{sfn|Walker|1993|p=80}}

During the period in which ''Deutsche Physik'' was gaining prominence, a foremost concern of the great majority of scientists was to maintain autonomy against political encroachment.{{sfn|Beyerchen|1977|pp=199–210}} Some of the more established scientists, such as [[Max von Laue]], could demonstrate more autonomy than the younger and less established scientists.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2005|pp=293–329}} This was, in part, due to political organizations, such as the ''Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Dozentenbund'' (National Socialist German University Lecturers League), whose district leaders had a decisive role in the acceptance of an ''[[Habilitationsschrift]]'', which was a prerequisite to attaining the rank of ''[[Privatdozent]]'' necessary to becoming a university lecturer.{{sfn|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|loc=Appendix C; see the entry for the NSDDB}} While some with ability joined such organizations out of tactical career considerations, others with ability and adherence to historical academic standards joined these organizations to moderate their activities. This was the case of Finkelnburg.{{sfn|Beyerchen|1977|pp=176–79}}{{sfn|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|pp=341–42}} In mid-1940 Finkelnburg became an acting director of the NSDDB at ''Technische Hochschule'', Darmstadt.{{sfn|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|p=290}} As such, he organized the ''Münchner Religionsgespräche'', which took place on 15 November 1940 and was known as the ''Munich Synod ''. The ''Münchner Religionsgespräche'' was an offensive against ''Deutsche Physik''.<ref>Finkelnburg invited five representatives to make arguments for theoretical physics and academic decisions based on ability, rather than politics: Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, [[Otto Scherzer]], [[Georg Joos]], Otto Heckmann, and Hans Kopfermann. [[Alfons Bühl]], a supporter of ''Deutsche Physik'', invited Harald Volkmann, [[Bruno Thüring]], Wilhelm Müller, [[Rudolf Tomaschek]], and Ludwig Wesch. The discussion was led by Gustav Borer, with Herbert Stuart and Johannes Malsch as observers.

==Exploitation and denial strategies==
Near the end of World War II, the principal Allied war powers each made plans for exploitation of German science. In light of the implications of nuclear weapons, German nuclear fission and related technologies were singled out for special attention. In addition to exploitation, denial of these technologies, their personnel, and related materials to rival allies was a driving force of their efforts. This typically meant getting to these resources first, which to some extent put the Soviets at a disadvantage in some geographic locations easily reached by the Western Allies, even if the area was destined to be in the Soviet zone of occupation by the [[Potsdam Conference]]. At times all parties were heavy-handed in their pursuit and denial to others.{{sfn|Gimbel|1986|pp=433–51}}{{sfn|Gimbel|1990|}}{{sfn|Goudsmit|1986|}}{{sfn|Naimark|1995|}}{{sfn|Oleynikov|2000|pp=1–30}}

The best known US denial and exploitation effort was [[Operation Paperclip]], a broad dragnet that encompassed a wide range of advanced fields, including jet and rocket propulsion, nuclear physics, and other developments with military applications such as infrared technology. Operations directed specifically towards German nuclear fission were [[Operation Alsos]] and [[Operation Epsilon]], the latter being done in collaboration with the British. In lieu of the codename for the Soviet operation it is referred to by the historian Oleynikov as the [[Russian Alsos|Russian "Alsos"]].{{sfn|Oleynikov|2000|p=3}}

===American and British===
Berlin had been a location of many German scientific research facilities. To limit casualties and loss of equipment, many of these facilities were dispersed to other locations in the later years of the war.

====Operation BIG====
Unfortunately for the Soviets, the ''Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Physik'' (KWIP, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics) had mostly been moved in 1943 and 1944 to [[Hechingen]] and its neighboring town of [[Haigerloch]], on the edge of the [[Black Forest]], which eventually became the French occupation zone. This move allowed the Americans to take into custody a large number of German scientists associated with nuclear research. The only section of the institute which remained in Berlin was the low-temperature physics section, headed by {{ill|Ludwig Bewilogua|de|Ludwig Bewilogua}}, who was in charge of the exponential uranium pile.{{sfn|Naimark|1995|pp=208–09}}{{sfn|Bernstein|2001|pp=49–52}}

American Alsos teams carrying out Operation BIG raced through Baden-Wurttemburg near the war's end in 1945, uncovering, collecting, and selectively destroying ''Uranverein'' elements, including capturing a prototype reactor at Haigerloch and records, heavy water, and uranium ingots at [[Tailfingen]].<ref>Beck, Alfred M, et al, ''United States Army in World War II: The Technical Services – The Corps of Engineers: The War Against Germany'', 1985 Chapter 24, ''Into the Heart of Germany''</ref> These were all shipped to the US for study and utilization in the US atomic program.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Koeth|first=Timothy|last2=Hiebert|first2=Miriam|date=2019|title=Tracking the journey of a uranium cube|url=http://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/PT.3.4202|journal=Physics Today|language=en|volume=72|issue=5|pages=36–43|doi=10.1063/PT.3.4202|issn=0031-9228}}</ref>

Nine of the prominent German scientists who published reports in ''Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte'' as members of the ''Uranverein''{{sfn|Walker|1993|loc=pp. 268–74 and Reference n. 40 on p. 262}} were picked up by [[Operation Alsos]] and incarcerated in England under [[Operation Epsilon]]: [[Erich Bagge]], [[Kurt Diebner]], [[Walther Gerlach]], [[Otto Hahn]], [[Paul Harteck]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Horst Korsching]], [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]], and [[Karl Wirtz]]. Also incarcerated was [[Max von Laue]], although he had nothing to do with the nuclear weapon project. [[Samuel Goudsmit|Goudsmit]], the chief scientific advisor to Operation Alsos, thought von Laue might be beneficial to the postwar rebuilding of Germany and would benefit from the high level contacts he would have in England.{{sfn|Bernstein|2001|pp=50, 363–65}}

====Oranienburg plant====
With the interest of the ''Heereswaffenamt'' (HWA, Army Ordnance Office), [[Nikolaus Riehl]], and his colleague [[Günter Wirths]], set up an industrial-scale production of high-purity uranium oxide at the ''[[Auergesellschaft]]'' plant in [[Oranienburg]]. Adding to the capabilities in the final stages of metallic uranium production were the strengths of the Degussa corporation's capabilities in metals production.{{sfn|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|loc=p. 369 Appendix F (see the entry for Nikolaus Riehl), and Appendix D (see the entry for Auergesellschaft)}}{{sfn|Riehl|Seitz|1996|pp=13, 69}}

The Oranienburg plant provided the uranium sheets and cubes for the ''Uranmaschine'' experiments conducted at the KWIP and the ''Versuchsstelle'' (testing station) of the ''Heereswaffenamt'' (Army Ordnance Office) in Gottow.

Work of the American Operation Alsos teams, in November 1944, uncovered leads which took them to a company in Paris that handled rare earths and had been taken over by the ''Auergesellschaft''. This, combined with information gathered in the same month through an Alsos team in [[Strasbourg]], confirmed that the Oranienburg plant was involved in the production of uranium and thorium metals. Since the plant was to be in the future Soviet zone of occupation and the Red Army's troops would get there before the Western Allies, General [[Leslie Groves]], commander of the [[Manhattan Project]], recommended to General [[George Marshall]] that the plant be destroyed by aerial bombardment, in order to deny its uranium production equipment to the Soviets. On 15 March 1945, 612 [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers of the [[Eighth Air Force]] dropped 1,506 tons of high-explosive and 178 tons of incendiary bombs on the plant. Riehl visited the site with the Soviets and said that the facility was mostly destroyed. Riehl also recalled long after the war that the Soviets knew precisely why the Americans had bombed the facility—the attack had been directed at them rather than the Germans.{{sfn|Bernstein|2001|pp=50–51}}{{sfn|Naimark|1995|pp=205–07}}{{sfn|Riehl|Seitz|1996|pp=77–79}}{{sfn|Walker|1993|p=156}}<ref>Leslie M.

===French===
From 1941 to 1947, [[Friedrich Bopp|Fritz Bopp]] was a staff scientist at the KWIP, and worked with the ''Uranverein''. In 1944, when most of the KWIP was evacuated to [[Hechingen]] in Southern Germany due to air raids on Berlin, he went there too, and he was the Institute's Deputy Director there. When the [[Operation Alsos|American Alsos]] Mission evacuated Hechingen and [[Haigerloch]], near the end of World War II, French armed forces occupied Hechingen. Bopp did not get along with them and described the initial French policy objectives towards the KWIP as exploitation, forced evacuation to France, and seizure of documents and equipment. The French occupation policy was not qualitatively different from that of the American and Soviet occupation forces, it was just carried out on a smaller scale. In order to put pressure on Bopp to evacuate the KWIP to France, the French Naval Commission imprisoned him for five days and threatened him with further imprisonment if he did not cooperate in the evacuation. During his imprisonment, the [[spectroscopist]] {{ill|Hermann Schüler|de|Hermann Schüler}} , who had a better relationship with the French, persuaded the French to appoint him as Deputy Director of the KWIP. This incident caused tension between the physicists and spectroscopists at the KWIP and within its umbrella organization the ''[[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute|Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft]]'' (Kaiser Wilhelm Society).{{sfn|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|loc=Appendix F; see the entry for Bopp}}{{sfn|Walker|1993|pp=186–87}}{{sfn|Bernstein|2001|loc=p. 212 and footnote 5 on p. 212}}<ref>For information on the American and Russian exploitation of Germany after World War II, see: {{harvnb|Naimark|1995}}, {{harvnb|Gimbel|1990|}} and {{harvnb|Gimbel|1986|pp=433–51}}.</ref>

===Soviet===
At the close of World War II, the Soviet Union had special search teams operating in Austria and Germany, especially in Berlin, to identify and obtain equipment, material, intellectual property, and personnel useful to the [[Soviet atomic bomb project]]. The exploitation teams were under the [[Russian Alsos|Soviet Alsos]] and they were headed by [[Lavrentiy Beria|Lavrentij Beria's]] deputy, [[Avraami Zavenyagin|Colonel General A. P. Zavenyagin]]. These teams were composed of scientific staff members, in [[NKVD]] officer's uniforms, from the bomb project's only laboratory, Laboratory No. 2, in Moscow, and included [[Yulii Borisovich Khariton|Yulij Borisovich Khariton]], [[Isaak Kikoin|Isaak Konstantinovich Kikoin]], and [[Lev Artsimovich|Lev Andreevich Artsimovich]]. [[Georgy Flyorov|Georgij Nikolaevich Flerov]] had arrived earlier, although Kikoin did not recall a vanguard group. Targets on the top of their list were the ''Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für Physik'' (KWIP, [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics]]), the Frederick William University (today, the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]]), and the ''Technische Hochschule Berlin'' (today, the ''Technische Universität Berlin'' ([[Technical University of Berlin]]'').{{sfn|Oleynikov|2000|pp=3–8}}{{sfn|Riehl|Seitz|1996|pp=71–83}}{{sfn|Naimark|1995|pp=203–50}}

German physicists who worked on the ''Uranverein'' and were sent to the [[Soviet Union]] to work on the [[Soviet atomic bomb project]] included: {{ill|Werner Czulius|de|Werner Czulius}}, [[Robert Döpel]], [[Walter Herrmann (physicist)|Walter Herrmann]], [[Heinz Pose]], [[Ernst Rexer]], [[Nikolaus Riehl]], and [[Karl Zimmer]]. [[Günter Wirths]], while not a member of the ''Uranverein'', worked for Riehl at the ''[[Auergesellschaft]]'' on reactor-grade uranium production and was also sent to the Soviet Union.

Zimmer's path to work on the Soviet atomic bomb project was through a prisoner of war camp in [[Krasnogorsk, Moscow Oblast|Krasnogorsk]], as was that of his colleagues [[Hans-Joachim Born]] and [[Alexander Catsch]] from the ''Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für Hirnforschung'' (KWIH, [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Brain Research]], today the ''[[Max-Planck-Institut für Hirnforschung]]''), who worked there for [[Nikolay Timofeev-Ressovsky|N. V. Timofeev-Resovskij]], director of the ''Abteilung für Experimentelle Genetik'' (Department of Experimental Genetics). All four eventually worked for Riehl in the Soviet Union at [[Laboratory B in Sungul']].{{sfn|Riehl|Seitz|1996|pp=121–32}}{{sfn|Oleynikov|2000|pp=11, 15–17}}

[[Manfred von Ardenne|Von Ardenne]], who had worked on isotope separation for the ''[[Reichspostministerium]]'' (Reich Postal Ministry), was also sent to the Soviet Union to work on their atomic bomb project, along with [[Gustav Hertz]], Nobel laureate and director of Research Laboratory II at [[Siemens]], [[Peter Adolf Thiessen]], director of the ''Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für physikalische Chemie und Elektrochemie'' (KWIPC, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry and Electrochemisty, today the [[Fritz Haber Institute of the MPG|Fritz Haber Institute of the Max-Planck Society]]), and [[Max Volmer]], director of the Physical Chemistry Institute at the Berlin ''Technische Hochschule'' (Technical University of Berlin), who all had made a pact that whoever first made contact with the Soviets would speak for the rest.<ref>Heinemann-Grüder, Andreas ''Keinerlei Untergang: German Armaments Engineers during the Second World War and in the Service of the Victorious Powers'' in {{harvnb|Renneberg|Walker|2002|p=44}}.</ref> Before the end of World War II, Thiessen, a member of the [[Nazi Party]], had Communist contacts.{{sfn|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|loc=Appendix F; see the entry for Thiessen}} On 27 April 1945, Thiessen arrived at von Ardenne's institute in an armored vehicle with a major of the Soviet Army, who was also a leading Soviet chemist, and they issued Ardenne a protective letter (''Schutzbrief'').{{sfn|Oleynikov|2000|pp=5, 11–13}}

==Comparison to the Manhattan Project==
The United States, British, and Canadian governments worked together to create the Manhattan Project that developed the uranium and plutonium atomic bombs.  Its success has been attributed{{By whom|date=July 2020}} to meeting all four of the following conditions:{{sfn|Landsman|2002|pp=318–19}}

#A strong initial drive, by a small group of scientists, to launch the project.
#Unconditional government support from a certain point in time.
#Essentially unlimited manpower and industrial resources.
#A concentration of brilliant scientists devoted to the project.

Even with all four of these conditions in place the Manhattan Project succeeded only after the war in Europe had been brought to a conclusion.

For the Manhattan Project, the second condition was met on 9 October 1941 or shortly thereafter. Germany for a long time was thought to have fallen short of what was required to make an atomic bomb.{{sfn|Landsman|2002|pp=303, 319}}{{sfn|Bernstein|2001|pp=122–23}}<ref>M.

As to condition four, the high priority allocated to the Manhattan Project allowed for the recruitment and concentration of capable scientists on the project. In Germany, on the other hand, a great many young scientists and technicians who would have been of great use to such a project were conscripted into the German armed forces, while others had fled the country before the war due to antisemitism and political persecution.<ref name=Mangravite>{{cite journal|last1=Mangravite|first1=Andrew|title=Magical Thinking|journal=Distillations|date=2015|volume=1|issue=4|pages=44–45|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/magical-thinking|access-date=22 March 2018}}</ref><ref name=Ball>{{cite book|last1=Ball|first1=Philip|author-link=Philip Ball |title=Serving the Reich : the struggle for the soul of physics under Hitler|date=2014|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226204574}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Van der Vat |first=Dan |date=1997 |title=The Good Nazi: The Life and Lies of Albert Speer |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |isbn=978-039565243-5 }} [https://archive.org/details/goodnazilifelies00vand/page/138 p. 138]</ref>

Whereas [[Enrico Fermi]], a scientific Manhattan Project leader, had a "''unique double aptitude for theoretical and experimental work''" in the 20th century,{{sfn|Hanle|Rechenberg|1982|}} the successes at Leipzig until 1942 resulted from the cooperation between the theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg and the experimentalist [[Robert Döpel]]. Most important was their experimental proof of an effective neutron increase in April 1942.<ref>Robert and [[Klara Döpel]], Werner Heisenberg, ''Der experimentelle Nachweis der effektiven Neutronenvermehrung in einem Kugel-Schichten-System aus D2O und Uran-Metall''. Facsimile: [http://www.deutsches-museum.de/archiv/archiv-online/Geheimdokumente Forschungszentren/Leipzig/Neutronenvermehrung (1942)]. Published 1946 in: Heisenberg, W., Collected Works Vol. A II (Eds. W. Blum, H.-P Dürr and [[Helmut Rechenberg|H. Rechenberg]], Berlin etc. (1989), pp. 536–44.</ref> At the end of July of the same year, the group around Fermi also succeeded in the neutron increase within a reactor-like arrangement.

In June 1942, some six months before the American [[Chicago Pile-1]] achieved man-made [[Criticality (status)|criticality]] for the first time anywhere, Döpel's L-IV "''Uran-Maschine''" [[Leipzig L-IV experiment accident|was destroyed]] by a chemical explosion introduced by [[oxygen]],<ref>This was the first accident that disrupted a nuclear energy assembly; cf. Reinhard Steffler, ''Reaktorunfälle und die Handlungen der Feuerwehr: Leipzig, Tschernobyl und Fukushima&nbsp;– eine erste Analyse.'' Elbe-Dnjepr-Verlag Leipzig-Mockrehna 2011. {{ISBN|3-940541-33-8}}.</ref> which finished the work on this topic at Leipzig. Thereafter, despite increased expenditures the Berlin groups and their extern branches did not succeed in getting a reactor critical until the end of World War II. However, this was realized by the Fermi group in December 1942, so that the German advantage was definitively lost, even with respect to research on energy production.

German historian [[Klaus Hentschel]] summarizes the organizational differences as:

:Compared with the British and American war research efforts united in the Manhattan Project, to this day the prime example of 'big science," the Uranverein was only a loosely knit, decentralized network of researchers with quite different research agendas. Rather than teamwork as on the American end, on the German side we find cut-throat competition, personal rivalries, and fighting over the limited resources.{{sfn|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|p=lxviii}}

In terms of financial and human resources, the comparisons between the Manhattan Project and the ''Uranverein'' are stark. The Manhattan Project consumed some US$2 billion (1945,~US$32.2 billion in 2021 dollars ) in government funds, and employed at its peak some 120,000 people, mostly in the sectors of construction and operations. Total, the Manhattan Project involved the labor of some 500,000 people, nearly 1% of the entire US civilian labor force.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/11/01/many-people-worked-manhattan-project/ |title= How many people worked on the Manhattan Project? |publisher=Restricted Data Blog |date=1 November 2013 |access-date=16 November 2019 |last=Wellerstein |first=Alex |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721043916/http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/11/01/many-people-worked-manhattan-project//# |archive-date=21 July 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> By comparison, the ''Uranverein'' was budgeted a mere 8 million reichsmarks, equivalent to about US$2 million (1945,~US$32.2 million in 2021 dollars) –&nbsp;one one-thousandth of the American expenditure.{{sfn|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|p=lxix}}
