==Vlogging career==
In a July 2019 profile, ''[[The Verge]]'' wrote of Dobrik's vlog: "Think of it like ''[[Friends]]'', but for vloggers. Essentially, Dobrik created the first [[sitcom]]-vlog. There are musical transitions, a returning cast of characters that drive the story forward, and Dobrik's laughter acts as a laugh track for viewers. We know when to laugh because Dobrik does, and it all has to do with his friends' antics."<ref name="Verge2019" /> In that same profile, writer Julia Alexander noted Dobrik's editing style for bringing [[Vine (service)|Vine]]'s quick-cut style format to YouTube. "It led to a wave of creators who copied him," she wrote, "many of whom continue to shape the site's content today."<ref name="Verge2019"/>

{{anchor|The Vlog Squad}}

===Cast ("The Vlog Squad")===
Dobrik's vlogs feature a recurring group of friends who collectively comprise "The Vlog Squad". Because the cast is, at its core, a friend group, membership in the cast of the vlogs is amorphous.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-david-dobriks-vlog-squad-with-youtube-video-editor-ughitsjoe-2020-1|title=A YouTube video editor who works with David Dobrik's Vlog Squad told us what it's like to film top creators, from private jets to quick turnarounds|last=Perelli|first=Amanda|website=Business Insider|access-date=7 February 2020}} {{subscription required|s}}</ref> Generally, people considered part of the Vlog Squad include [[Jason Nash]], Natalie Mariduena, [[Josh Peck]], Zane Hijazi, Heath Hussar, Mariah Amato, Scotty Sire, Ilya Fedorovich, Nick Antonyan and his siblings Vardan and Suzy, Matt King, Toddy Smith, Corinna Kopf, Jeff Wittek, Joe Vulpis, Carly Incontro and Erin Gilfoy.<ref name=2019StreamysInterview>{{cite web |last=Kile |first=Meredith B. |title=David Dobrik and the Vlog Squad Celebrate Ensemble Cast Win at 2019 Streamy Awards (Exclusive) |url=https://www.etonline.com/david-dobrik-and-the-vlog-squad-celebrate-ensemble-cast-win-at-2019-streamy-awards-exclusive-138012 |publisher=[[Entertainment Tonight|ET Online]] |date=13 December 2019 |access-date=16 December 2019}}</ref><ref name=CastList17>{{cite web |last=Fuentes |first=Tamara |title=Who is in David Dobrik's Vlog Squad? |url=https://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/g29133485/david-dobrik-friends/ |website=[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]] |date=30 September 2019 |access-date=16 December 2019}}</ref><ref name="Verge2019" />

Because the cast of the vlogs samples Dobrik's larger friend group, membership rotates on an ongoing basis. Former or infrequently-featured members include [[Gabbie Hanna]], [[Liza Koshy]], [[Trisha Paytas]], Nik Keswani (known as BigNik), Dom Zeglaitis, Seth Francois, Brandon Calvillo, Elton Castee, Kristen McAtee and Alex Ernst.<ref name=CastListPostAthens>{{cite web |last=Runnells |first=Riley |title=Everything you need to know to about David Dobrik and the Vlog Squad |url=https://www.thepostathens.com/article/2018/11/david-dobrik-vlog-squad-members-youtube |date=31 October 2018 |access-date=16 December 2019}}</ref><ref name=CastList17/><ref name=2019StreamysInterview/><ref name=NewsweekTrishaDrama>{{cite news |last=Asarch |first=Steven |title=YouTuber Trisha Paytas Calls Out David Dobrik and Vlog Squad for Manipulation (Update) |url=https://www.newsweek.com/trisha-paytas-david-dobrik-twitter-jason-nash-1317335 |website=[[Newsweek]] |date=4 February 2019 |access-date=16 December 2019}}</ref>

Speaking at the [[9th Streamy Awards|2019 Streamy Awards]], Dobrik said of winning the Ensemble Cast prize with the Vlog Squad, "Ensemble is like, my favorite one to win... [The nominations are] insane, and I can't say this enough‚Äîit's all because of these guys," he added. "I have a group of like, 15, 20, 30 friends, and they help me day in and day out with all the videos."<ref name=2019StreamysInterview/>

=== Controversies ===

====Vlog Squad sexual assault allegations====
In February 2021, Seth Francois, a former Vlog Squad member, accused Dobrik of [[sexual assault]] after being deceived into kissing Jason Nash while blindfolded.

==== Dobrik injuring Jeff Wittek ====
In April 2021, Vlog Squad member [[Jeff Wittek]] released a documentary on his YouTube channel titled ''Don't Try This At Home'' which explained the circumstances of an accident that happened in June 2020, when Wittek broke his skull and face, resulting in major surgery. The incident occurred during a video shoot for Dobrik's comeback vlog when the Vlog Squad went [[wakeboarding]] in a shallow lake while being pulled by Dobrik using an [[excavator]]. Wittek's documentary included video showing fellow Vlog Squad member Corinna Kopf swinging from the line but started to lose balance and nearly falling, prompting her to ask to be released, which Dobrik did not immediately do and causing her to accuse him of "taking things too far." When it was Wittek's turn, Dobrik swung him even higher than anyone before him and then suddenly stopped. The momentum of Wittek continuing to swing around caused him to crash into the excavator and then fall into the shallow lake while still attached to the line.<ref>{{Cite web |last=O'Connor |first=Florence |last2=Haylock |first2=Zoe |date=22 April 2021 |title=A Timeline of the David Dobrik Allegations and Controversies |url=https://www.vulture.com/2021/04/david-dobrik-allegations-controversies-timeline.html |access-date=22 April 2021 |website=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Dodgson |first=Lindsay |date=22 April 2021 |title=Vlog Squad member Jeff Wittek revealed he injured his eye while swinging from an excavator David Dobrik was controlling |url=https://www.insider.com/jeff-wittek-eye-injury-david-dobrik-documentary-2021-4 |access-date=3 May 2021 |website=[[Insider (website)|Insider]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite episode |title=How I Broke My Face |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTuJLt6tz1I&t=564s |access-date=22 April 2021 |series=Don't Try This At Home |last=Wittek |first=Jeff |network=[[YouTube]] |date=21 April 2021 |season=1 |number=2 |time=9:24}}</ref>
