His mother, Monica, and the two boys later moved to [[Cork (city)|Cork]], where the brothers were raised.

Both sons were musically inclined and encouraged by their parents to pursue music.<ref name="keeper"/> At age nine, Gallagher received his first guitar from them. He built on his burgeoning ability on [[ukulele]] in teaching himself to play the guitar and perform at minor functions. After winning a cash prize in a talent contest when he was twelve, he bought his first guitar. Gallagher began performing in his adolescence with both his acoustic guitar, and an electric guitar. However, it was a 1961 [[Fender Stratocaster]], which he purchased three years later for [[Pound sterling|£]]100 that became his primary instrument and was most associated with him during his career.<ref name="Modernguitar1">{{cite web|url=http://www.modernguitars.com/legends/rory-gallagher|title=Rory Gallagher: A Previously Unpublished Interview |last=Minhinnet| first=Ray |date=21 July 2005 |publisher=Modern Guitar Magazine |access-date=23 December 2009}}</ref>

Gallagher was initially attracted to [[skiffle]] after hearing [[Lonnie Donegan]] on the radio. Donegan frequently [[cover version|covered]] [[blues]] and [[folk music|folk]] performers from the United States. He relied entirely on radio programs and television. Occasionally, the [[BBC]] would play some blues numbers, and he slowly found some song books for guitar, where he found the names of the actual composers of blues pieces.{{citation needed|date = August 2018}}

While still in school, playing songs by [[Buddy Holly]] and [[Eddie Cochran]], he discovered his greatest influence in [[Muddy Waters]]. He began experimenting with folk, blues, and rock music. Unable to find or afford record albums, Gallagher stayed up late to hear [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] and [[American Forces Network|AFN]] where the radio brought him his only exposure to the actual songwriters and musicians whose music moved him most.<ref name="1991 radio influences">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGoTiOl2J8M|title=Rory Gallagher 2nd Interview 1991 Audio|last=Gallagher|first=Rory|year=1991|work=Radio interview|access-date=4 April 2010}}</ref>

Influences he discovered, and cited as he progressed, included [[Woody Guthrie]], [[Big Bill Broonzy]], and [[Lead Belly]]. Singing and later using a brace for his harmonica, Gallagher taught himself to play [[slide guitar]]. Further, throughout the next few years of his musical development, Gallagher began learning to play [[alto saxophone]], bass, [[mandolin]], [[banjo]], and the [[coral sitar]] with varying degrees of proficiency.<ref name="Hunter">{{cite web|title=Won't See His Like Again|url=http://www.rory.de/cork/shunter/article.html|last=Hunter|first=Stephen|date=4 January 2000|work=This is a re-print of The Archive&nbsp;– Journal of the Northside Folklore Project, Issue 4, Jan 2000 pp.5–8 converted from PDF to HTML|pages=5–8|access-date=3 December 2009}}</ref> By his mid-teens, he began experimenting heavily with different blues styles.<ref name="Rockpalast interview">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSmi3SdApNc|title=Rory Gallagher – 1976 interview, Part 1|year=1976|work=WDR Studio Hall L Cologne, Grugahalle, Essen|publisher=The Complete Rockpalast Collection|access-date=4 December 2009|location=Germany}}</ref>

==Taste==
[[File:Rory Gallagher acoustic.jpg|thumb|Gallagher on acoustic guitar, March 1978]]
{{Main|Taste (Irish band)}}
Having completed a musical apprenticeship in the showbands, and influenced by the increasing popularity of [[beat music|beat groups]] during the early 1960s, Gallagher formed "The Taste", which was later renamed simply, "[[Taste (Irish band)|Taste]]", a [[blues rock]] and [[R&B]] [[power trio]], in 1966.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia 2">{{cite book|first=David|last=Roberts|year=1998|title=Guinness Rockopedia|edition=1st|publisher=Guinness Publishing Ltd.|location=London, UK|pages=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessrockoped0000unse/page/168 168–69]|isbn=0-85112-072-5|url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessrockoped0000unse/page/168}}</ref> Initially, the band was composed of Gallagher and two Cork musicians, Eric Kitteringham (died 2013) and Norman Damery. However, by 1968, they were replaced with two musicians from Belfast, featuring Gallagher on guitar and vocals, drummer John Wilson, and bassist Richard McCracken.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia 2"/>

Performing extensively in the UK, the group played regularly at the [[Marquee Club]], supporting both [[Cream (band)|Cream]] at their [[Royal Albert Hall]] farewell concert, and the blues supergroup [[Blind Faith]] on a tour of North America. Managed by Eddie Kennedy, the trio released the albums ''[[Taste (Taste album)|Taste]]'' and ''[[On the Boards (album)|On The Boards]]'', and two live recordings, ''[[Live Taste]]'' and ''[[Live at the Isle of Wight (Taste album)|Live at the Isle of Wight]]''.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia 2"/>

The latter appeared long after the band's break-up shortly after their appearance at the 1970 [[Isle of Wight Festival 1970|Isle of Wight Festival]].<ref name=buckley>Buckley, Peter (ed.; 2003). ''The Rough Guide To Rock'', pp. 409–10. Rough Guides Ltd; {{ISBN|1-84353-105-4}}</ref>

==Solo career==
After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name, hiring former Deep Joy bass player [[Gerry McAvoy]] to play on Gallagher's self-titled debut album, ''[[Rory Gallagher (album)|Rory Gallagher]]''.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book|first=Martin C.|last=Strong|year=2000|title=The Great Rock Discography|edition=5th|publisher=Mojo Books|location=Edinburgh, Scotland|pages=369–370|isbn=1-84195-017-3}}</ref>

It was the beginning of a twenty-year musical relationship between Gallagher and McAvoy; the other band member was drummer [[Wilgar Campbell]].<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia 2"/> The 1970s were Gallagher's most prolific period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, ''[[Live in Europe (Rory Gallagher album)|Live in Europe]]'' and ''[[Irish Tour|Irish Tour '74]]''. November 1971 saw the release of the album ''[[Deuce (Rory Gallagher album)|Deuce]]''.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

In the same year he was voted ''[[Melody Maker]]'''s International Top Guitarist of the Year, ahead of [[Eric Clapton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.innerviews.org/inner/rory.html|title=Defender of the blues|website=Innerviews.org|access-date=11 March 2010}}</ref> However, despite a number of his albums from this period reaching the [[UK Albums Chart]], Gallagher did not attain major star status.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia 2"/>
[[File:Rory-Gallagher.jpg|thumb|Gallagher in 1987]]
Gallagher played and recorded what he said was "in me all the time, and not just something I turn on ...". Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim.<ref name=buckley/> He is documented in ''Irish Tour '74'', a film directed by [[Tony Palmer]].

During the heightened periods of political unrest in [[Northern Ireland]], as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians. {{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Gallagher admitted in several interviews that there were not any international Irish acts until [[Van Morrison]] and he, and later [[Phil Lynott]] and [[Thin Lizzy]]. The line-up which included [[Rod de'Ath]] on drums and [[Lou Martin]] on keyboards, performed together between 1973–1976. However, he eventually dropped down to just bass, guitar and drums, and his act became a [[power trio]]. Other releases from that period include ''[[Against the Grain (Rory Gallagher album)|Against the Grain]]'', ''[[Calling Card]]'', ''[[Photo-Finish]]'', and ''[[Top Priority]]''.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

In January 1975, when the [[Rolling Stones]] gathered in [[Rotterdam, Netherlands]], to continue working towards their album ''[[Black and Blue]]'' they auditioned new guitarists, to replace [[Mick Taylor]], as they recorded. Gallagher went over for a jam with the band "just to see what was going on," but did not join the group, happy with his solo career.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Power|first=Ed|date=2020-06-15|title=The lost Rolling Stone: how guitar great Rory Gallagher was airbrushed from rock history|language=en-GB|work=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/lost-rolling-stone-guitar-great-rory-gallagher-airbrushed-rock/|access-date=2020-06-15|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>

He played on Lonnie Donegan's final album.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

In the 1980s he continued recording, producing ''[[Jinx (Rory Gallagher album)|Jinx]]'', ''[[Defender (album)|Defender]]'', and ''[[Fresh Evidence]]''. After ''Fresh Evidence'', he embarked on a tour of the United States. In addition he played with [[Box of Frogs]], a band formed in 1983 by former members of [[The Yardbirds]]. Becoming obsessive over details and plagued by self-doubt, Gallagher nevertheless retained a loyal fanbase. During this period he stated "I agonize too much".<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia 2"/>

''[[Notes From San Francisco]]'', an album of unreleased studio tracks and a San Francisco 1979 concert, was released in May 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/notes-from-san-francisco-mw0002132783|title=Notes from San Francisco – Rory Gallagher: Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards|website=[[AllMusic]]|last=Horowitz|first=Hal|access-date=18 August 2012}}</ref>

This Stratocaster was in the store as a used instrument, it was 100 pounds. In today's money you couldn't even compare; you might as well say it was a million pounds. My mother was saying we'll be in debt for the rest of our lives and Rory said, 'Well, actually with a guitar like this I can play both parts, rhythm and lead, we won't need a rhythm player so I can earn more money and pay it off.' So the Stratocaster became his partner for life if you like."<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Thuillier, Ian (Director)|year=2010|title=Ghost Blues The Story of Rory Gallagher|location=Event occurs at 5:35}}</ref>

Virtually all of the finish on Gallagher's Stratocaster was stripped away over time, and, while he took care to keep the guitar in playable condition, Gallagher never had it restored, stating "the less paint or varnish on a guitar, acoustic or electric, the better. The wood breathes more. But it’s all psychological. I just like the sound of it".<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rorygallagher.com/#/archives/guitars|title=Rory Gallagher {{!}} The Official Website|website=Rorygallagher.com|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref> Gallagher's brother Dónal has also stated that, owing to his rare blood type {{Citation needed|date=May 2021}}, Gallagher's sweat was unusually acidic, acting to prematurely age the instrument's paintwork.<ref name=":0" />

He installed a five-way selector switch in place of the vintage three-way type.<ref name="Corp.2014" />

In late October 2011, Dónal Gallagher brought the guitar out of retirement to allow [[Joe Bonamassa]] to perform with it on his two nights at the [[Hammersmith Apollo]] in London.

Though known for his Stratocaster, Gallagher also used a number of other guitars, including acoustic examples, during his career.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://guitarvillage.co.uk/products/martin-d-35-rory-gallagher-natural-7-of-29-pre-owned-2006-ec | publisher = Guitar Village Ltd | title = Martin D-35 Rory Gallagher Natural #7 Of 29 | website = guitarvillage.co.uk | quote = ''Whilst Gallagher is most noted for his iconic 1961 Stratocaster, when he switched to acoustic the [Martin] D-35 was his go to'' | access-date = 18 September 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.viviancampbellrocks.com/RoryGallagher.htm | title = Interview - The Wearing Of The Blues - August 1991 | publisher =  Vivian Campbell | website = viviancampbellrocks.com | access-date = 18 September 2018 }}</ref> In April 2014 one of the last guitars owned by Gallagher, a custom-built [[Patrick Eggle]] 'JS Berlin Legend', was sold at auction in England for £25,000.<ref name="BBC News 11 April 2014">{{cite web | title= Rock star Rory Gallagher's guitar up for auction |url=  https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-26967058| author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date= 11 April 2014| website= BBC News | access-date= 3 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/discover/royal-interest-as-rory-gallagher-guitar-sells-for-30k-627644.html | title=Royal interest as Rory Gallagher guitar sells for €30k | website=Breakingnews.ie | date=11 April 2014 | access-date=11 April 2014}}</ref>

Gallagher also used a number of models of amplifiers during his career, generally preferring smaller 'combo' amplifiers to more powerful [[Marshall Amplification#Marshall Stack|Marshall 'stacks']] popular with rock and hard rock guitarists. To make up for the relative lack of power on stage, he would link several different combo amps together.<ref name="month145">{{cite web | url=http://www.roryon.com/month145.html | title=International Musician of the Month - Rory Gallagher | website=Roryon.com | access-date= 3 August 2018}}</ref>

[[File:Rory's vox & guitars.jpg|thumb|left|Gallagher’s [[Vox (company)|Vox]] [[Vox AC30|AC30]] amp and guitars]]
When Gallagher was with [[Taste (Irish band)|Taste]], he used a single [[Vox AC30]] with a Dallas Rangemaster [[treble booster]] plugged into the 'normal' input.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Gallagher also used an [[Ibanez Tube Screamer]],<ref name="beat"/> and several [[Boss Corporation|Boss]] effects, including a [[flanger]].<ref name="guitar91"/>

In the 1970s, Gallagher began to use [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] amplifiers with a Hawk booster.<ref name="month145"/><ref name="beat"/> Later in the 1970s, when Gallagher was moving towards a hard rock sound, he experimented with [[Ampeg]] VT40 and VT22 amplifiers, and also used [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] combos.<ref name="guitar91">{{cite web | url=http://www.roryon.com/guitar91.html | title=Guitar for the Practicing Musician, August 1991 issue | website=Roryon.com | access-date= 4 August 2018}}</ref><ref name="beat">{{cite web | url=http://www.roryon.com/beat.html | title=BEAT Instrumental, March 1979 issue | website=Roryon.com | access-date= 4 August 2018}}</ref>

Gallagher was an early adopter of Boss ME-5 all-in-one floor based effects units, and used such a unit for his live work up until his death in the mid-1990s.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} He also used Stramp 2100a amplifiers, which can be seen in his appearances on the German ''[[Beat Club]]'' program. Another company that built amplifiers for Gallagher was PCL Vintage Amp.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcl-vintageamp.de/Ueber-uns |language= de |title= PCL Vintage Amp - Über uns (about us) |website=Pcl-vintageamp.de |access-date=10 August 2018 }}</ref>

==Death==
In the later years of his life, Gallagher developed a phobia of flying. To overcome this, he was prescribed various drugs. By the time of his final performance on 10 January 1995 in the [[Netherlands]], he was visibly ill with severe abdominal pain and the tour had to be cancelled. He was prescribed [[paracetamol]] for the pain, a drug that can be extremely harmful to the liver, especially for a heavy drinker such as Gallagher.<ref name="connaughton2012"/>

Gallagher was admitted to London's [[King's College Hospital]] in March 1995, and it was only then that the extent of his ill health became apparent; his liver was failing and the doctors determined that, in spite of his young age, a liver transplant was the only possible course of action.<ref name="Bnet">{{cite web|last=Quigley|first=Maeve|title=Booze didn't kill my brother Rory, it was the drugs to help his fear|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Booze+didn%27t+kill+my+brother+Rory,+it+was+the+drugs+to+help+his+fear...-a084782459|access-date=19 October 2012}}</ref> After thirteen weeks in intensive care, while waiting to be transferred to a convalescent home, his health suddenly worsened when he contracted a [[staphylococcal]] ([[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]) infection, and he died on 14 June 1995, at the age of 47.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> He was unmarried and had no children.

Gallagher's body was buried in St Oliver's Cemetery, on the Clash Road just outside [[Ballincollig]] near Cork City, Ireland. The grave's headstone is in the image of an award he received in 1972 for International Guitarist of the Year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/5418/rory-gallagher|title=Rory Gallagher (1948-1995) |website=Findagrave.com|access-date=13 May 2021}}</ref>

==Legacy==
In 2003, ''[[Wheels Within Wheels]]'', a collection of acoustic tracks, was released posthumously by Gallagher's brother Donal. Collaborators on this album included [[Bert Jansch]], [[Martin Carthy]], [[The Dubliners]], Spanish flamenco guitarist [[Juan Martin]] and [[Lonnie Donegan]].
