==Biography==

Mikhail Vorobyov was born in the Proletarsky district, also known as Morozovskiy Gorodok, in the city of [[Tver|Kalinin]], which would later be known as Tver. He was born to Vladimir Mikhailovich Vorobyov and Zoya Petrovna Vorobyova. He was inspired by the music of [[Vladimir Vysotsky]] since his childhood. His stage name is derived from the word [[Russian language|Russian]] word "Krug", which means circle.

After completing service in the army, Krug entered a song contest in 1987, in which he would take first place with the song "About Afghanistan". Afterwards, he decided to seriously pursue songwriting as a career.
Krug then recorded his first three albums, ''Tverskiye Streets'' (1989), ''Katya'' (1990), and an untitled third album. These albums were not released officially, but were distributed through [[Music piracy|piracy]], to which Krug would give his blessing. Most of the songs on these three albums would be rerecorded for his later albums. His first official album, ''Zhigan-Limon'' (1994), featured one of his biggest hits, "Kolshchik". Krug often associated with criminals, who inspired his music. Many of Krug's songs invoke the secret code of Russian prisons and the symbolism of [[Prison tattooing|prisoner tattoos]]. Krug used a 1924 [[NKVD]] dictionary of underworld slang to help write his songs. He also wrote love songs and songs about [[Tver]].
