Although Ronson had never met [[Michael Jackson]] he was given the vocal track to a song titled "Lovely Way", sung by [[Michael Jackson]], in 2010 to produce for Jackson's posthumous album ''[[Michael (album)|Michael]]''. He submitted the track, but it did not make the tracklisting for ''Michael''. Ronson said about the rumours surrounding the vocals on the track (due to the controversy surrounding the Cascio tracks on that same album), "It was definitely him singing. I was given a vocal track to work with but I never actually met Michael. [...] It's in the vein of Elton John's 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road' and John Lennon's 'Imagine'."<ref>{{Cite web |date=6 November 2010 |title=Mark Ronson's Michael Jackson track 'definitely' features King of Pop's vocals |url=https://www.nme.com/news/mark-ronson/53742 |access-date=6 November 2010 |website=NME}}</ref>
