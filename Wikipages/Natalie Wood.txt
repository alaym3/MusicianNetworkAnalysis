'''Natalie Wood''' (born '''Natalie Zacharenko''',{{r|group=n|"name at birth"}} {{Lang-rus|Наталья Николаевна Захаренко|r=Natalia Nikolaevna Zakharenko}}; July 20, 1938 – November 29, 1981) was an American actress who began her career in film as a child and successfully transitioned to young adult roles. She was the recipient of four [[Golden Globes]] and three [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations.

Born in [[San Francisco]] to Russian immigrant parents, Wood started acting at age four and was given a co-starring role at age 8 in ''[[Miracle on 34th Street]]'' (1947).<ref name="people1">{{cite journal | last = Wilkins | first = Barbara | date = December 13, 1976 | title = Second Time's the Charm&nbsp;– Marriage, Natalie Wood, Robert Wagner | journal = [[People (magazine)|People]] | volume = 6 | issue = 24 |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20067214,00.html | access-date = March 11, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421161534/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20067214,00.html | archive-date = April 21, 2016 | url-status = live }}</ref> As a teenager, she earned a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her performance in ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955), followed by a role in [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956). Wood starred in the musical films ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'' (1961) and ''[[Gypsy (1962 film)|Gypsy]]'' (1962), and received nominations for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her performances in ''[[Splendor in the Grass]]'' (1961) and ''[[Love with the Proper Stranger]]'' (1963). Her career continued with films such as ''[[Sex and the Single Girl (film)|Sex and the Single Girl]]'' (1964), ''[[Inside Daisy Clover]]'' (1964), and ''[[Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice]]'' (1969).

During the 1970s, Wood began a hiatus from film and had two daughters by different men; one with her second husband [[Richard Gregson]], and one with [[Robert Wagner]], her first husband whom she married again after divorcing Gregson. She acted in only two feature films throughout the decade, but appeared slightly more often in television productions, including a remake of ''[[From Here to Eternity (miniseries)|From Here to Eternity]]'' (1979) for which she won a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]]. Wood's films represented a "coming of age" for her and for Hollywood films in general.<ref name=Tibbetts /> Critics have suggested that her cinematic career represents a portrait of modern American womanhood in transition, as she was one of the few to take both child roles and those of middle-aged characters.<ref>{{Cite book | title = 'Natalie Wood, Studio Stardom and Hollywood in Transition.' in American film history : selected readings | last = Lucia | first = Cynthia | others = Lucia, Cynthia A., Grundmann, Roy, Simon, Art | isbn = 978-1118475133 | location = Chicester, West Sussex | pages = 423–447 | oclc = 908086219 | year=2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | title = Natalie Wood | last = Sullivan| first = Rebecca | others = British Film Institute | isbn = 978-1844576371 | location = London | oclc = 933420525 | date = 2016}}</ref>

Wood was born Natalie Zacharenko{{r|group=n|"name at birth"}} in San Francisco, California, to Maria Zudilova (1908–1998),{{efn|Wood's mother was born on January 26, 1908, according to the earliest available records.<ref name="Tatuloff">Tatuloff, Alexander (September 17, 1934).

Now known as [[Lana Wood]], she also became an actress.

===Early roles===
[[File:Natalie Wood 1947 photo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Wood as Jenny Hollingsworth in ''Driftwood'', 1947]]
A few weeks before her fifth birthday, Wood made her uncredited film debut in a fifteen-second scene in the film ''[[Happy Land (film)|Happy Land]]'' (1943). Despite the brief part, she attracted the notice of the director, [[Irving Pichel]].{{sfn|Lambert|2004|pp=25–26}} He remained in contact with Wood's family for two years, advising them when another role came up. The director telephoned Wood's mother and asked her to bring her daughter to Los Angeles for a [[screen test]]. Wood's mother became so excited that she "packed the whole family off to Los Angeles to live," writes Harris. Wood's father opposed the idea, but his wife's "overpowering ambition to make Natalie a star" took priority.{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=25}} According to Wood's younger sister Lana, Pichel "discovered her and wanted to adopt her."{{sfn|Wood|1984|p=50}}

Wood, then seven years old, got the part. She played a post-[[World War II]] German orphan, opposite [[Orson Welles]] as Wood's guardian and [[Claudette Colbert]], in ''[[Tomorrow Is Forever]]'' (1946). When Wood was unable to cry on cue, her mother tore a butterfly to pieces in front of her to ensure she would sob for a scene.<ref>{{cite news | last1 = Moore | first1 = Paul | title = Natalie Wood's life of beauty, agony |url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2001-07-08-0107080329-story.html | access-date = July 5, 2019 | work = The Baltimore Sun | date = July 8, 2001 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190705044432/https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2001-07-08-0107080329-story.html | archive-date = July 5, 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref> Welles later said that Wood was a born professional, "so good, she was terrifying."<ref name=OConnerJ-NYT->{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/08/arts/tv-weekend-a-documentary-remembrance-of-natalie-wood.html | title = TV Weekend; A Documentary Remembrance of Natalie Wood | author = John J.

Wood acted in another film directed by Pichel, ''[[The Bride Wore Boots]]'', and went on to [[20th Century Fox]] to play [[Gene Tierney]]'s daughter in ''[[The Ghost and Mrs. Muir]]'' (1947).

===''Miracle on 34th Street''===
Wood's best-known film as a child was ''[[Miracle on 34th Street]]'' (1947), starring [[Maureen O'Hara]] at Fox. She plays a girl who believes [[Edmund Gwenn]] is Santa Claus. The film has become a Christmas classic; Wood was counted among the top child stars in Hollywood after the film and was so popular that [[Macy's]] invited her to appear in the store's annual [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade|Thanksgiving Day parade]].{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=25}}

Film historian [[John C. Tibbetts]] wrote that for the next few years following her success in ''Miracle'', Wood played roles as a daughter in a series of family films: ''[[Driftwood (1947 film)|Driftwood]]'' (1947), at Republic;<ref>"Natalie Wood", ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', 21 Mar 1948: B20.</ref> ''[[Scudda Hoo!

She also appeared on television on episodes of ''[[Kraft Theatre]]'', ''[[Chevron Theatre]]'',

Because Wood was a minor during her early years as an actress, she received her primary education on the studio lots wherever she was contracted. California law required that until age 18, child actors had to spend at least three hours per day in the classroom, notes Harris. "She was a straight A student", and one of the few child actors to excel at [[arithmetic]]. Director [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]], who directed her in ''[[The Ghost and Mrs. Muir]]'' (1947), said that, "In all my years in the business, I never met a smarter moppet."{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=25}} Wood remembered that period in her life, saying, "I always felt guilty when I knew the crew was sitting around waiting for me to finish my three hours. As soon as the teacher let us go, I ran to the set as fast as I could."{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=25}}

Wood's mother continued to play a significant role in her daughter's early career, coaching her and micromanaging aspects of her career even after Wood acquired agents.<ref>{{cite news | last1 = Rubin | first1 = Merle | title = The Story of Natalie Wood Is Also the Story of Her Mother |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-jul-30-cl-28120-story.html | access-date = July 5, 2019 | work = Los Angeles Times | date = July 30, 2001 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190705044432/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-jul-30-cl-28120-story.html | archive-date = July 5, 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref> As a child actress, Wood received significant media attention. By age nine, she had been named the "most exciting juvenile motion picture star of the year" by ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Lambert|2004|p=37}}

==Teen stardom==
[[File:Natalie Wood and Lana Wood 1956.jpg|thumb|Wood with her younger sister [[Lana Wood]] in 1956]]
In the 1953–54 television season, Wood played Ann Morrison, the teenage daughter in ''[[The Pride of the Family]],'' an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[Sitcom|situation comedy]]. She appeared as a teenager on episodes of ''[[The Pepsi-Cola Playhouse]]'', ''Public Defender'', ''[[Mayor of the Town (TV series)|Mayor of the Town]]'', ''[[Four Star Playhouse]]'', ''[[The Ford Television Theatre]]'', and ''[[General Electric Theater]]'',  as well as appeared in a TV version of ''Heidi''.  She described the ''GE Theater'' episode she did, "Carnival", as one of the best things she ever did.<ref name="affair"/>

She had roles in the feature films ''[[The Silver Chalice (film)|The Silver Chalice]]'' and ''[[One Desire]]'' (1955).

===''Rebel Without a Cause''===
Wood successfully made the transition from child star to [[ingénue]] at age 16 when she co-starred with [[James Dean]] and [[Sal Mineo]] in ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955), [[Nicholas Ray]]'s film about teenage rebellion. Wood had to sign to a long-term contract with Warners but she was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]]. She later said it was the first script she read that she actually wanted to do as opposed to being told to do by her parents; she also said her parents were opposed to her doing it. "Until then I did what I was told," she said.<ref name="promo">NATALIE WOOD HITS PROMO TRAIL: Natalie Wood
Blume, Mary. Los Angeles Times (1923-1995); February 8, 1970: q10.</ref>

She continued to guest star on TV shows like ''[[Studio One in Hollywood]]'', ''[[Camera Three]]'', ''[[Kings Row (TV series)|Kings Row]]'', ''[[Studio 57]]'', ''[[Warner Brothers Presents]]'', and ''[[The Kaiser Aluminum Hour]]''.

She had a small but crucial role in [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956) and was the female lead in ''[[A Cry in the Night (1956 film)|A Cry in the Night]]'' (1956).

===Tab Hunter and ''Marjorie Morningstar''===
Wood graduated from [[Van Nuys High School]] in 1956.{{sfn|Lambert|2004|p=102}} She signed with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] and was kept busy during the remainder of the decade in many "girlfriend" roles, which she found unsatisfying.{{sfn|Lambert|2004|p=115}}

The studio cast her in two films opposite [[Tab Hunter]], hoping to turn the duo into a box-office draw that never materialized: ''[[The Burning Hills]]'' (1956), a Western, and ''[[The Girl He Left Behind]]'' (1956). She guest starred in episodes of ''Conflict''.

Warners tried teaming her with [[Efrem Zimbalist Jr.]] in ''[[Bombers B-52]]'' (1957) then she was given the lead in a prestigious project, ''[[Marjorie Morningstar (film)|Marjorie Morningstar]]'' (1958). As Marjorie Morningstar, Wood played the role of a young Jewish girl in New York City who has to deal with the social and religious expectations of her family as she tries to forge her own path and separate identity.<ref>Natalie Wood Still Up for Plum

==Adult career==
[[File:Natalie Wood 1958 cropped.jpg|left|thumb|Wood in 1958]]
Tibbetts observed that Wood's characters in ''Rebel'', ''Searchers'', and ''Morningstar'' began to show her widening range of acting styles.<ref name=Tibbetts /> Her former "childlike sweetness" was now being combined with a noticeable "restlessness that was characteristic of the youth of the 1950s."

She was leading lady to [[Frank Sinatra]] in ''[[Kings Go Forth]]'' (1958) then refused roles and was put on suspension by Warners. This lasted for a year until February 1959.<ref>Studio Lifts Suspension of Natalie Wood
Los Angeles Times February 25, 1959: B1.</ref> She returned to be leading lady to James Garner in ''[[Cash McCall]]'' (1960). After Wood appeared in the box office flop ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960), she lost momentum. Wood's career was in a transition period, having until then consisted of roles as a child or as a teenager.<ref name=Tibbetts />

===''Splendor in the Grass''===
Biographer [[Suzanne Finstad]] wrote that a "turning point" in Wood's life as an actress took place when she saw the film ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' (1951): "She was transformed, in awe of director [[Elia Kazan]] and of [[Vivien Leigh]]'s performance&nbsp;... [who] became a role model for Natalie."{{sfn|Finstad|2001|p=107}} "Her roles raised the possibility that one's sensitivity could mark a person as a kind of victim," noted Tibbetts.<ref name=Tibbetts />

After a "series of bad films, her career was already in decline", according to author Douglas Rathgeb.<ref>{{cite book | title = The Making of Rebel Without a Cause | last = Rathgeb | first = Douglas L. | year = 2004 | publisher = [[McFarland & Company]] | location = Jefferson, North Carolina | isbn = 0-7864-6115-2 | page = 199 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=C_9aRwAACAAJ&q=0786461152 | access-date = March 12, 2014 | archive-date = May 17, 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210517194326/https://books.google.com/books?id=C_9aRwAACAAJ&q=0786461152 | url-status = live }}</ref> She was then cast in Kazan's ''Splendor in the Grass'' (1961) with [[Warren Beatty]]. Kazan wrote in his 1997 memoir that the "sages" of the film community declared her "washed up" as an actress, but he still wanted to interview her for his next film:

{{quote|When I saw her, I detected behind the well-mannered 'young wife' front a desperate twinkle in her eyes&nbsp;... I talked with her more quietly then and more personally. I wanted to find out what human material was there, what her inner life was&nbsp;... Then she told me she was being psychoanalyzed. That did it. Poor R.J. [Wagner], I said to myself. I liked Bob Wagner, I still do.{{Sfn|Kazan|1997|p=602}}}}

Kazan cast Wood as the female lead in ''Splendor'', and her career rebounded. He felt that despite her earlier innocent roles, she had the talent and maturity to go beyond them. In the film, Beatty's character was deprived of sexual love with Wood's character, and as a result turns to another, "looser" girl. Wood's character could not handle the sexuality and after a breakdown was committed to a mental institution. Kazan writes that he cast her in the role partly because he saw in Wood's personality a "true-blue quality with a wanton side that is held down by social pressure," adding that "she clings to things with her eyes," a quality he found especially "appealing."<ref name=Tibbetts />
[[File:Natalie Wood Ruth Gordon 23rd Golden Globes.jpg|thumb|Wood with [[Ruth Gordon]] at the [[23rd Golden Globe Awards]]]]
Finstad felt that although Wood had never trained in [[method acting]] techniques, "working with Kazan brought her to the greatest emotional heights of her career. The experience was exhilarating, but wrenching for Natalie, who faced her demons on ''Splendor.''"{{sfn|Finstad|2001|p=259}} She adds that a scene in the film, as a result of "Kazan's wizardry&nbsp;... produced a hysteria in Natalie that may be her most powerful moment as an actress."{{sfn|Finstad|2001|p=260}} Actor [[Gary Lockwood]], who also performed in the film, felt that "Kazan and Natalie were a terrific marriage, because you had this beautiful girl, and you had somebody that could get things out of her." Kazan's favorite scene in the film was the last one, when Wood goes back to see her lost first love, Bud (Beatty). "It's terribly touching to me. I still like it when I see it," wrote Kazan.{{sfn|Finstad|2001|p=263}}

For her performance in ''Splendor'', Wood received nominations for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Academy Award]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama|Golden Globe Award]], and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role]].

===''West Side Story''===
Wood played Maria, a restless Puerto Rican girl on the West Side of Manhattan, in ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'', [[Jerome Robbins]] and [[Robert Wise]]'s 1961 film of the stage musical, which was a critical and box-office success. Tibbetts wrote of similarities in her role in this film and the earlier ''Rebel.'' She was to represent the "restlessness of American youth in the 1950s", expressed by youth gangs and juvenile delinquency, along with early [[rock and roll]]. Both films, he observes, were "modern allegories based on the '[[Romeo and Juliet]]' theme, including private restlessness and public alienation. Where in ''Rebel'' she falls in love with the character played by James Dean, whose gang-like peers and violent temper alienated him from his family, in ''West Side Story'' she enters into a romance with a white former gang member whose threatening world of outcasts also alienated him from lawful behavior."<ref name=Tibbetts />

Although Wood's singing in the film was voiced by [[Marni Nixon]],{{sfn|Lambert|2004|p=171}} ''West Side Story'' is still regarded as one of Wood's best films.

===Peak years of stardom===
Wood sang when she starred in the film ''[[Gypsy (1962 film)|Gypsy]]'' (1962) alongside [[Rosalind Russell]].{{sfn|Lambert|2004|p=185}}<ref>Natalie Wood in 'Gypsy'
The Christian Science Monitor (1908-Current file); Boston, Mass. [Boston, Mass]Nov 7, 1961: 6.</ref> Her appearance in that film led critic <!-- Review of "Gypsy" first published in 1962 and collected in "I Lost It At the Movies" (1965), p. 131 --> [[Pauline Kael]] to comment "clever little Natalie Wood&nbsp;... [the] most machine-tooled of Hollywood ingénues."<ref name=Tibbetts />

At the age of 25, Wood received her third Academy Award nomination for ''[[Love with the Proper Stranger]]'' (1963), making Wood (along with [[Teresa Wright]]) the youngest person to score three Oscar nominations. This record was later broken by [[Jennifer Lawrence]] in 2013 and [[Saoirse Ronan]] in 2017, both of whom scored their third nominations at the age of 23.

Wood made two comedies with [[Tony Curtis]]: ''[[Sex and the Single Girl (film)|Sex and the Single Girl]]'' (1964) and ''[[The Great Race]]'' (1965), the latter with [[Jack Lemmon]], and [[Peter Falk]]. In ''The Great Race'', her ability to speak Russian was an asset given to her character Maggie DuBois, justifying the character's recording the progress of the race across [[Siberia]] and entering the race at the beginning as a contestant.

Director [[Sydney Pollack]] was quoted as saying about Wood, "When she was right for the part, there was no one better. She was a damn good actress." For ''[[Inside Daisy Clover]]'' (1965) and ''[[This Property Is Condemned]]'' (1966), both of which co-starred [[Robert Redford]], Wood received Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress. After the release of the films, Wood suffered emotionally and sought professional therapy.{{sfn|Finstad|2001|p=}} She paid Warner Bros. $175,000 to cancel her contract and fired her entire support team: agents, managers, publicist, accountant, and attorneys.{{sfn|Finstad|2001|p=}} In the mid 1960s she was one of the biggest stars in Hollywood along with Elizabeth Taylor and Audrey Hepburn.<ref>Natalie Wood: Splendid Splinter

Although many of Wood's films were commercially successful, at times her acting was criticized. In 1966, Wood was given ''[[the Harvard Lampoon]]'' award for being the "Worst Actress of Last Year, This Year, and Next".<ref>{{cite web | title = Bonhams : A pair of Natalie Wood awards from The Harvard Lampoon and The Harvard Crimson |url=https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/22486/lot/34/ | website = www.bonhams.com | access-date = May 3, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190503075920/https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/22486/lot/34/ | archive-date = May 3, 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref> She was the first performer to attend their ceremony and accept an award in person.

===''Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice'' and retirement===
Wood co-starred with [[Dyan Cannon]], [[Robert Culp]] and [[Elliott Gould]] in ''[[Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice]]'' (1969), a comedy about [[Sexual revolution|sexual liberation]]. According to Tibbetts, this was the first film in which "the saving leavening of humor was brought to bear upon the many painful dilemmas portrayed in her adult films."<ref name=Tibbetts />

Wood did not capitalize on the success of ''Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice''. After becoming pregnant in 1970 with her first child, [[Natasha Gregson Wagner|Natasha Gregson]], she went into semi-retirement and would act in only four more theatrical films during the remainder of her life. She made a brief cameo appearance as herself in ''[[The Candidate (1972 film)|The Candidate]]'' (1972), working once more with Robert Redford.

==Later career==
Wood reunited on the screen with Robert Wagner in the television [[Television film|film of the week]] ''[[The Affair (1973 film)|The Affair]]'' (1973), and with [[Laurence Olivier]] and Wagner in an adaptation of ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'' (1976) for the British series ''[[Laurence Olivier Presents]]'' broadcast as a special by [[NBC]].<ref name="affair">Working Vacation for Natalie Wood

In between these she made ''[[Peeper (film)|Peeper]]'' (1975) with [[Michael Caine]].

She made cameo appearances on Wagner's prime-time detective series ''[[Switch (American TV series)|Switch]]'' in 1978 as "Bubble Bath Girl," and ''[[Hart to Hart]]'' in 1979 as "Movie Star".

After another lengthy break, she appeared in the ensemble disaster film ''[[Meteor (film)|Meteor]]'' (1979) with [[Sean Connery]] and the sex comedy ''[[The Last Married Couple in America]]'' (1980) with [[George Segal]] and [[Valerie Harper]]. Her performance in the latter was praised and considered reminiscent of her performance in ''Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice''. In ''Last Married Couple'', Wood broke ground: although an actress with a clean, middle-class image, she used the [[Fuck|"F" word]] in a frank marital discussion with her husband ([[George Segal]]).

===Television===
In this period, Wood had more success in television, receiving high ratings and critical acclaim in 1979 for ''[[The Cracker Factory]]'' and especially the miniseries remake of ''[[From Here to Eternity (TV series)|From Here to Eternity]]'' (1979), with [[Kim Basinger]] and [[William Devane]]. Wood's performance in the latter won her a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Actress in 1980. She starred in ''[[The Memory of Eva Ryker]]'', released in May 1980, which proved to be her last completed production.<ref>Natalie Wood in 'The Cracker Factory'

At the time of her death, Wood was filming the $15 million [[science fiction film]] ''[[Brainstorm (1983 film)|Brainstorm]]'' (1983), co-starring Christopher Walken and directed by [[Douglas Trumbull]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/27/movies/news-of-hollywood-m-g-m-to-finish-natalie-wood-film.html|title=News of Hollywood; M-G-M to Finish Natalie Wood Film|first=Aljean|last=Harmetz|work=The New York Times|date=January 27, 1982|accessdate=March 29, 2021|archive-date=May 21, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210521190601/https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/27/movies/news-of-hollywood-m-g-m-to-finish-natalie-wood-film.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

She expected to follow her performance as "Anastasia" on the stage with a starring stint in a film adaptation of the work.<ref name="Reed"/> The ending of ''Brainstorm'' had to be re-written and Wood's character written out of at least three scenes, while a [[stand-in]] and sound-alikes were used to replace Wood for some of her crucial shots. The film was released posthumously on September 30, 1983, and was dedicated to Wood in the closing credits.

Wood appeared in 56 films for cinema and television. In one of her last interviews before her death, she was defined as "our sexual conscience on the silver screen."<ref>{{Cite news | title = Natalie Wood: Our Sexual Conscience on the Silver Screen. | date = August 1980 | work = L'Officiel/USA| pages = 87–88}}</ref> Following her death, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine noted that although critical praise for Wood had been sparse throughout her career, "she always had work".<ref name="Time-1981-12-14">{{cite magazine | title = The Last Hours of Natalie Wood |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,925095,00.html | magazine = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = December 14, 1981 | access-date = January 13, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222052438/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,925095,00.html | archive-date = December 22, 2007 | url-status = dead }}{{Subscription required}}</ref>

Following this [[starter marriage]], Wood dated [[Warren Beatty]], [[Michael Caine]] and [[David Niven Jr.]]. She also had a broken engagement in 1965 with Venezuelan shoe manufacturer Ladislav Blatnik.{{sfn|Finstad|2001|p=174}}

[[File:Wood - Wagner - 1960.jpg|thumb|Wood with husband Robert Wagner, 1960]]
On May 30, 1969, Wood married British producer [[Richard Gregson]] after dating for nearly three years. They had a daughter, [[Natasha Gregson Wagner|Natasha]] (born September 29, 1970). Wood filed for divorce from Gregson on August 4, 1971, and it was finalized on April 12, 1972.<ref>{{cite news | title = Natalie Wood: A Hollywood enigma |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-15789921 | work = BBC News | date = November 18, 2011 | access-date = November 3, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191201012240/https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-15789921 | archive-date = December 1, 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref>

After a short-lived romance with future California governor [[Jerry Brown]], Wood resumed her relationship with Wagner at the end of January 1972.{{sfn|Lambert|2004|p=257}} They remarried on July 16 aboard the Ramblin' Rose, anchored off Paradise Cove in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]]. Their daughter Courtney was born on March 9, 1974.{{sfn|Finstad|2001|p=174}} Wood's sister Lana Wood said of this period:
{{quote|Her marriage was considered to be one of the best in Hollywood, and there is no question that she was a devoted, loving—even adoring—mother and stepmother. She and R.

Natalie "hated" her former screen idol afterward, "shuddering" if she heard his name.

Davern had previously stated that Wood and Wagner argued that evening, which Wagner denied at the time. In his memoir ''Pieces of My Heart'', Wagner admitted that he had an argument with Wood before she disappeared.<ref name="BBC082212" /> The autopsy found that Wood's blood alcohol content was 0.14% and that there were traces of a motion-sickness pill and a painkiller in her bloodstream, both of which increase the effects of alcohol.{{sfn|Finstad|2001|p=433}} Los Angeles County coroner [[Thomas Noguchi]] ruled the cause of her death to be accidental drowning and hypothermia.{{sfn|Noguchi|DiMona|1983|p=43}} According to Noguchi, Wood had been drinking and she may have slipped while trying to re-board the dinghy.<ref name="BBC082212" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-lineup/what-really-happened-the_b_8594972.html | title = What Really Happened the Night Natalie Wood Died | work = [[Huffington Post]]|first=Paola |last=Crespo | date = November 18, 2015 | access-date = January 27, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202041556/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-lineup/what-really-happened-the_b_8594972.html | archive-date = February 2, 2017 | url-status = live }}</ref> Her sister Lana expressed doubts, alleging that Wood could not swim and had been "terrified" of water all her life, and that she would never have left the yacht on her own by dinghy.<ref name="Telegraph">{{cite news | title = Natalie Wood was too 'terrified' of water to try to leave Robert Wagner on yacht by dinghy |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/8901179/Natalie-Wood-was-too-terrified-of-water-to-try-to-leave-Robert-Wagner-on-yacht-by-dinghy.html|work=The Telegraph|first=Philip|last=Sherwell | date = November 19, 2011 | access-date = February 2, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202233238/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/8901179/Natalie-Wood-was-too-terrified-of-water-to-try-to-leave-Robert-Wagner-on-yacht-by-dinghy.html | archive-date = February 2, 2018 | url-status = live }}</ref> Two witnesses who were on a nearby boat stated that they had heard a woman scream for help during the night.<ref name="LAT20180201">{{cite news | title = How The Times covered Natalie Wood's mysterious death in 1981 |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-natalie-wood-story-stack-20180201-story.html | access-date = February 2, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202001258/http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-natalie-wood-story-stack-20180201-story.html | archive-date = February 2, 2018 | url-status = live }}</ref>

Wood was buried in [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]] in Los Angeles. Representatives of international media, photographers, and members of the public tried to attend her funeral, but all were required to remain outside the cemetery walls. Among the celebrities were [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[David Niven]], [[Gregory Peck]], [[Gene Kelly]], [[Elia Kazan]], and [[Laurence Olivier]].{{sfn|Lambert|2004|pp=320–321}} Olivier flew in from London in order to attend the service.{{sfn|Harris|1988|p=210}}

The case was reopened in November 2011 after Davern publicly stated that he had lied to police during the initial investigation and that Wood and Wagner had an argument that evening. He alleged that Wood had been flirting with Walken, that Wagner was jealous and enraged, and that Wagner had prevented Davern from turning on the search lights and notifying authorities after Wood's disappearance. Davern alleged that Wagner was responsible for her death.<ref name="BBC082212"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.today.com/id/45353418/#.UqIX-_RDt7g | title = Captain: Wagner responsible for Natalie Wood death | publisher = Today.com | date = November 18, 2011 | access-date = May 23, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212013431/http://www.today.com/id/45353418/#.UqIX-_RDt7g | archive-date = December 12, 2013 | url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.today.com/popculture/boat-captain-alleges-actor-robert-wagner-responsible-natalie-woods-death-2D80555795#.UqIX-_RDt7g | title = Boat captain alleges actor Robert Wagner responsible for Natalie Wood's death | publisher = Today.com | access-date = February 2, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202021901/https://www.today.com/popculture/boat-captain-alleges-actor-robert-wagner-responsible-natalie-woods-death-2D80555795#.UqIX-_RDt7g | archive-date = February 2, 2018 | url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Natalie Wood Death: New Audio Recordings Indicate Robert Wagner's Involvement |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/14/natalie-wood-death-new-audio-recordings_n_1885593.html | work = The Huffington Post | date = September 14, 2012 | access-date = September 17, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917024814/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/14/natalie-wood-death-new-audio-recordings_n_1885593.html | archive-date = September 17, 2012 | url-status = live }}</ref> Walken hired a lawyer, co-operated with the investigation, and was not considered a suspect by authorities.<ref>{{cite web | access-date = July 15, 2012 | work = New York Daily News | title = Natalie Wood cause of death changed to 'undetermined', deepening mystery |url=https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/natalie-wood-death-changed-accident-undetermined-deepening-mystery-article-1.1110457 | author = Meena Hart Duerson | date = July 9, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712123520/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/natalie-wood-death-changed-accident-undetermined-deepening-mystery-article-1.1110457 | archive-date = July 12, 2012 | url-status = live }}</ref>
