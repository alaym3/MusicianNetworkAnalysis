'''Flora May Augusta Flannagan''' (16 August 1875{{spaced ndash}}18 April 1940<ref name=ADB>{{cite web | url = http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/forde-florrie-12920 | title = Biography – Forde, Florrie (1875–1940)' | last = Brownrigg | first = Jeff | work = [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]], Supplementary Volume | publisher = [[Melbourne University Press]] | pages = 129–130 | accessdate = 7 July 2017 }}</ref>), known professionally as '''Florrie Forde''', was an Australian popular singer and [[music hall]] entertainer.<ref name=ADB/> From 1897 she lived and worked in the United Kingdom. She was one of the most popular stars of the early 20th century music hall.

==Early life and career==
Forde was born in [[Fitzroy, Victoria]] in 1875. She was the sixth of the eight children of Lott Flannagan, a stonemason, and Phoebe ([[Given name#Name at birth|née]] Simmons), who also had two children from a prior marriage. By 1878 her parents had separated and Phoebe married Thomas Ford, a theatrical costumier in 1888. Forde and some of her siblings were placed in a convent. At the age of sixteen, she ran away to live with an aunt in Sydney. When she appeared on the local music hall stage, she adopted her stepfather's surname but added an 'e'. One of her earliest vaudeville performances was as a singer in February 1892 at Polytechnic Music Hall in [[Pitt Street]].<ref name=ADB/> According to ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''{{'}}s reviewer, at one such performance in January 1892, "[i]n the first part the vocalists were all well received, and several had to respond to encores. The serio-comic song by Miss Florrie Ford, 'Yes, You Are,' proved a great attraction."<ref name="SMH Jan1892">{{cite news | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13844950 | title = The Sydney Morning Herald | newspaper = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | issue = 16,799 | date = 25 January 1892 | accessdate = 7 July 2017 | page = 5 | via = [[National Library of Australia]] }}</ref>

At the age of 21, in 1897, she left for London, and on [[August Bank Holiday]] 1897, she made her first appearances in London at three music halls&nbsp;– the South London Palace, the Pavilion and the Oxford&nbsp;– in the course of one evening. She became an immediate star, making the first of her many sound recordings in 1903 and making 700 individual recordings by 1936.

Forde had a powerful stage presence, and specialised in songs that had powerful and memorable choruses in which the audience was encouraged to join. She was soon drawing top billing, singing songs such as "[[Down at the Old Bull and Bush]]" and "[[Has Anybody Here Seen Kelly?]]". She appeared in the very first [[Royal Variety Performance]] in 1912. During [[World War I]], her most famous songs were some of the best known of the period, including "[[Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit-Bag]]", "[[It's A Long Way To Tipperary]]" and "[[Take Me Back to Dear Old Blighty]]".

==Marriage==
On 2 January 1893 in Sydney, she married Walter Emanuel Bew, a 31-year-old police constable.<ref name=ADB/> On 22 November 1905 at the register office, [[Paddington, London|Paddington]], London, as Flora Augusta Flanagan, spinster, she married Laurence Barnett (d.1934), an art dealer.<ref name=ADB/><ref>Register of Births, Marriages & Deaths, Paddington, Dec Qtr 1905, Vol 1a, page 194</ref>

==Revue==
Florrie Forde formed her own travelling revue in the 1920s. It provided a platform for new rising stars, the most famous being the singing duo of [[Flanagan and Allen]].

==Death and legacy==
She collapsed and died from a [[cerebral haemorrhage]], after singing for troops in [[Aberdeen]], Scotland, on 18 April 1940; she was 64. The [[Anglo-Irish]] poet [[Louis MacNeice]] left a tribute to her in a poem, 'Death of An Actress', recalling how:<blockquote>''With an elephantine shimmy and a sugared wink<br />She threw a trellis of Dorothy Perkins roses<br />Around an audience come from slum and suburb<br />And weary of the tea-leaves in the sink.<ref name=ADB/></blockquote>

She is buried in [[Streatham Park Cemetery]], London.<ref>[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Burials.htm#F ''Music Hall burials'' (Arthur Lloyd)] accessed 29 October 2007</ref>
