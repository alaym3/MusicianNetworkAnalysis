'''Infectious Grooves''' is an American [[funk metal]] [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] led by [[Suicidal Tendencies]] frontman [[Mike Muir]]. The current lineup also includes Suicidal Tendencies guitarist [[Dean Pleasants]], ex-[[Faith No More]] guitarist [[Jim Martin (musician)|Jim Martin]], [[Metallica]] bassist [[Robert Trujillo]], and [[Avenged Sevenfold]] drummer [[Brooks Wackerman]]. To date, the project released four albums between 1991 and 2000.

Though Muir's sense of humor was often obvious with Suicidal Tendencies, Infectious Grooves often brought out a goofier type of humor, incorporating comedy skits involving an anthropomorphic reptile named Aladdin Sarsippius Sulemenagic Jackson III.<ref name="LarkinHM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Heavy Metal]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1995|edition=Second|isbn=0-85112-656-1|pages=176/7}}</ref>  A mascot costume of Sarsippius was later created and often appeared during the band's live performances.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://heavymetalhill.com/2014/02/01/infectious-grooves-the-whisky-a-go-go-2/|title=Infectious Grooves The Whisky-A-Go-Go 1/31/2014|date=February 1, 2014|work=Heavy Metal Hill|access-date=October 23, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>

The Infectious Grooves were on hiatus between the release of their fourth album, 2000's ''[[Mas Borracho]]'' and 2007, while the band's personnel were busy with other projects. According to Muir, Infectious Grooves had been working on new material.<ref>[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=49084 BLABBERMOUTH.NET - SUICIDAL TENDENCIES: New Album Is 'Sounding Great'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223015940/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=49084 |date=December 23, 2008 }}</ref>  In April 2008 the band began a one-month tour across Europe, featuring [[Thundercat (musician)|Stephen Bruner]] on bass, Eric Moore on drums, Dean Pleasants and Tim Stewart on guitars.

Most of the band's original lineup reunited for the [[Orion Music + More]] festival in June 2013, with ex-Faith No More guitarist [[Jim Martin (musician)|Jim Martin]] filling in for [[Adam Siegel]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://lineup.orionmusicandmore.com/band/infectious-grooves |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413014345/http://lineup.orionmusicandmore.com/band/infectious-grooves |archive-date=April 13, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
