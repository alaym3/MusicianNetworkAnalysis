'''My Little Airport''' is a Hong Kong-based [[indie pop]] band.<ref>''Lost in Transition: Hong Kong Culture in the Age of China''</ref> Their English lyrics are marked by spelling, grammar, and rhythm inflected by [[Hong Kong English]]. The band's lyrics and music are written by Ah P (Lam Pang) and sung by Nicole (Nicole Au Kin-ying). The duo occasionally invite friends (Ah Suet, who speaks French, for instance) and relatives (Nicole's younger sister) to participate in their albums and shows. They established [[Harbour Records]] with four other indie bands from Hong Kong, and on it released their 2004 debut album ''[[The OK Thing to Do on Sunday Afternoon Is to Toddle in the Zoo]]''. In 2006 they joined [[Elefant Records]], hoping to gain distribution beyond Hong Kong's small indie fanbase.

==Career==
The band had its start while the two were journalism students at [[Hong Kong Shue Yan College]] (now [[Hong Kong Shue Yan University]]), writing songs in both English and Cantonese.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://josephbosco.com/wow2004/2004/10/music-review-china-my-little-airport.html|title=WoW: We Observe the World|date=13 December 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041213204818/http://josephbosco.com/wow2004/2004/10/music-review-china-my-little-airport.html|archive-date=13 December 2004}}</ref> They intended to put into use lessons learnt in class, and as a result this is why many of their songs have been said to follow the [[Five Ws]]: "Who?", "What?", "Where?", "When?", "Why?" as journalistic works typically do. The duo is also notable for their quirky song titles, often addressed to friends, such as "leo, are you still jumping out of windows in expensive clothes?", "victor, fly me to stafford", or addressed to celebrities, such as "[[Gigi Leung]] is dead", "[[Faye Wong]], about your eyebrows".

In 2009, the group started writing politically themed songs such as "divvying up [[Stephen Lam]]'s $300000 salary" and "[[Donald Tsang]], please die". The latter song was written after Tsang suggested that the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] were insignificant compared to China's current economic power<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://globalvoices.org/2009/05/18/hong-kong-donald-tsang-please-die/|title=Hong Kong: Donald Tsang, please die! |website=Globalvoices.org|date=18 May 2009}}</ref> (such social/political themes had already been extensively explored by Ah P with [[Forever Tarkovsky Club]], a side project he had set up with Pixeltoy's Ho Shan between 2007 and 2009).

A fourth album entitled ''[[poetics – something between montparnasse and mongkok]]'' was released on 23 November 2009, which contains many of those politically charged songs. A fifth album entitled ''Hong Kong is one big shopping mall'' was released on 26 August 2011, which received numerous awards (including the title of third best album in Cantonese 2011, by Sina Weibo). In October 2012, the band released their sixth album, ''lonely friday'', on the Harbour Records label.

On 30 November 2011, Hong Kong arts and culture magazine [[Muse (Hong Kong magazine)|''Muse'']] named my little airport Hong Kong's 'Next Big Thing' cultural heroes of 2011.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The song "you don't want to be my girlfriend, phoebe" was covered by the Scottish indie band, [[BMX Bandits (band)|BMX Bandits]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elefantrecords.bandcamp.com/album/the-bmx-love-ep|title=The BMX Love EP|publisher=Elefant Records|accessdate=16 August 2013}}</ref>
