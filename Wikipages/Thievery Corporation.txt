'''Thievery Corporation''' is an American [[electronic music]] duo consisting of Rob Garza and Eric Hilton. Their musical style mixes elements of [[Dub music|dub]], [[acid jazz]], [[reggae]], [[Indian classical music|Indian classical]], [[Middle Eastern music]], [[hip hop]], [[electronica]], and [[Brazilian music]], including [[bossa nova]].

== History ==
Thievery Corporation was formed in the summer of 1995 at Washington D.C.'s Eighteenth Street Lounge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2008/12/thievery-corporation/|work=Spin|title=Spotlight: Thievery Corporation|first=Larry|last=Fitzmaurice|date=December 19, 2008|access-date=January 10, 2019}}</ref> Rob Garza and Lounge co-owner Eric Hilton were drawn together over their mutual love of club life, as well as [[Dub music|dub]], [[bossa nova]] and [[jazz]] records. They decided to see what would come of mixing all these in a recording studio, and from this, in 1996 the duo started their [[Eighteenth Street Lounge Music]] record label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.18thstlounge.com/index.php/history|publisher=18thslounge|title=The Beginning|access-date=January 10, 2019}}</ref>

The duo drew attention with their first two 12-inch offerings, "Shaolin Satellite" and "2001: a Spliff Odyssey", and with their 1996 debut LP, ''[[Sounds from the Thievery Hi-Fi]]''.

In 2002 they released ''[[The Richest Man in Babylon (album)|The Richest Man in Babylon]]'' on their ESL label. This fifteen-track album is similar in sound and [[timbre]] to their earlier 2000 release, ''[[The Mirror Conspiracy]]'', and features performances by vocalists [[Emilíana Torrini]], [[Pam Bricker]], and Loulou.

In 2001, they released ''Sounds From The Verve Hi-Fi'', a "best of" compilation of 1960s–1970s material of [[Verve Records]] that includes [[Jazz]], [[Bossa Nova]] and [[Latin Jazz]] works from artists like [[Cal Tjader]], [[Wes Montgomery]], [[Sérgio Mendes|Sérgio Mendes & Brasil '66]], [[Luiz Bonfá]], among others. 

In 2004, they released ''[[The Cosmic Game]]'', which has a darker, more psychedelic sound than ''The Richest Man in Babylon''. The album also featured more high-profile guest singers on it, including [[Perry Farrell]], [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]], and [[Wayne Coyne]] of [[The Flaming Lips]].

In 2006, the group released ''[[Versions (Thievery Corporation album)|Versions]]'', a selection of remixes by Thievery Corporation for other artists. They toured around the United States, playing at [[Lollapalooza]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lollapalooza.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Lolla06.jpg|title=Lineup - 2006|page=45|publisher=Lollapalooza|access-date=January 6, 2019}}</ref> The tour was photographed by Rob Myers, Thievery Corporation's sitar and guitar player, in the [[Blurb (publisher)|Blurb]] [[photo book]] ''Thievery Corporation 2006''.<ref name="BLURB">{{cite book|url=http://www.blurb.com/bookstore/detail/76564|title=Thievery Corporation 2006|first=Rob|last=Myers|work=Blurb|date=August 14, 2007|access-date=March 11, 2009}}</ref> In 2006, the band also recorded "Sol Tapado" for the [[AIDS]] benefit album ''[[Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin]] Redux'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]. As well, in the 2006 release of ''[[Tiger Woods PGA Tour]]'' for Xbox, their music was featured as the soundtrack to the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-tees-up-tigers-new-tunes/1100-6132564/|title=EA tees up Tiger's new tunes|publisher=Games Spot|first=Tim|last=Surette|date= September 6, 2005|access-date=January 10, 2019}}</ref> Also in 2006, Puma Ptah, then known as Ras Puma, joined and toured with Thievery Corporation and continues to tour with them today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://composeyourselfmagazine.com/2015/07/artist-interview-puma-ptah-of-thievery-corporation-talks-solo-project-his-photography-and-grateful-dead/|publisher=Compose Yourself Magazine|title=Artist Interview: Puma Ptah Of Thievery Corporation Talks Solo Project, Photography, Grateful Dead Shows And More|first=Tai|last=C|date=July 22, 2015|access-date=January 10, 2019}}</ref>

On July 27, 2010, ''Babylon Central'', the cinematic directorial debut of founding member Eric Hilton, was released. Set (and shot) in Washington, D.C., the film follows tripwire events in the interconnected lives of its characters, each influencing power brokers' schemes to manipulate international currencies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thieverycorporation.com/news/babylon_central_released|title=Babylon Central released|work=ThieveryCorporation.com|access-date=October 13, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024153157/http://www.thieverycorporation.com/news/babylon_central_released|archive-date=October 24, 2010}}</ref>

In June 2011, Thievery Corporation released their sixth album, ''[[Culture of Fear]],'' which also featured the vocal stylings of Puma Ptah, then known as Ras Puma, on the tracks: "Overstand" and "False Flag Dub."

In January 2012, Thievery Corporation launched a remixes contest in conjunction with Dubspot.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://soundcloud.com/groups/thievery-corporation-culture-of-fear-remix-contest/tracks |title=Dubspot presents Thievery Corporation 'Culture of Fear' Remix Contest |publisher=Soundcloud |access-date=April 4, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128084058/http://soundcloud.com:80/groups/thievery-corporation-culture-of-fear-remix-contest/tracks |archive-date=January 28, 2012}}</ref> The same year, Eric Hilton from Thievery Corporation produced the debut album, ''Archives'', for Washington D.C. based reggae band "The Archives." 

The band released ''[[Saudade (Thievery Corporation album)|Saudade]]'' on March 25, 2014, via [[ESL Music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indieshuffle.com/thievery-corporation-depth-of-my-soul/|title=Thievery Corporation - Depth Of My Soul|publisher=Indie Shuffle|access-date=January 29, 2014}}</ref>

On January 11, 2017, the band released the song "Ghetto Matrix" from their album ''[[The Temple of I & I]]'', which was released on February 10, 2017, again via their own [[ESL Music]] label.<ref name=":0" />

On April 20, 2018, the band released ''Treasures from the Temple'' via ESL Music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thieverycorporation.com/treasures/|publisher=Thievery Corporation|title=Treasure From The Temple|access-date=January 10, 2019}}</ref>

Throughout their career, the duo has repeatedly expressed their fondness for [[Culture of Brazil|Brazilian culture]] in interviews and liner notes of their releases, especially of the 1960s [[Bossa Nova]] music movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thieverycorporation.com/thieveryhifi/|publisher=Thievery Corporation|title=Sounds From The Thievery Hi-Fi|access-date=January 10, 2019}}</ref> Some of their earlier recordings were accompanied by artwork paying specific homage to classic releases by bossa nova artists like [[João Gilberto]] (his [[João Gilberto (1973 album)|self-titled 1973 album]]) or [[Antônio Carlos Jobim|Tom Jobim]] ([[Stone Flower (album)|''Stone Flower'']]). Their [[Sounds from the Thievery Hi-Fi|1997 debut album]] is also dedicated to the memory of Brazilian musician [[Antonio Carlos Jobim]], who died three years earlier.

The language of the group's lyrics throughout their career include [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian Language|Italian]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Hindi]]. This reflects the group's world music influences.

== Politics ==
Thievery Corporation has taken liberal political stances on various issues, opposing war and what they regard as exploitative trade agreements, while supporting human rights and food programs.

In September 2005, the group participated in the Operation Ceasefire concert, with the objective of ending the [[Iraq War]].

From their press release regarding their album ''Radio Retaliation'', Garza said:

{{quote|text=''Radio Retaliation'' is definitely a more overt political statement [...] There's no excuse for not speaking out at this point, with the suspension of [[habeas corpus]], outsourced torture, illegal wars of aggression, fuel, food, and economic crises. It's hard to close your eyes and sleep while the world is burning around you. If you are an artist, this is the most essential time to speak up.|author=Rob Garza<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thieverycorporation.com/news.htm#08_14_08|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913113828/http://www.thieverycorporation.com/news.htm#08_14_08|archive-date=September 13, 2008|title=Thievery Corporation to release new album: Radio Retaliation out September 23rd}}</ref>}}

Thievery Corporation are vocal advocates for the [[World Food Programme]], seeing hunger as "...something basic, really elemental, that transcends boundaries around the world."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wfp.org/content/rob-garza-eric-hilton-thievery-corporation-wfp-celebrity-partner|title=Rob Garza & Eric Hilton, Thievery Corporation – WFP Celebrity partner|work=[[World Food Programme]]|access-date=March 31, 2009}}</ref>
