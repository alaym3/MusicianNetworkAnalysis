'''Opal''' is a [[hydrate]]d [[amorphous]] form of [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] (SiO<sub>2</sub>·''n''H<sub>2</sub>O); its water content may range from 3 to 21% by weight, but is usually between 6 and 10%. Because of its amorphous character, it is classed as a [[mineraloid]], unlike crystalline forms of silica, which are classed as minerals. It is deposited at a relatively low temperature and may occur in the fissures of almost any kind of [[rock (geology)|rock]], being most commonly found with [[limonite]], [[sandstone]], [[rhyolite]], [[marl]], and [[basalt]].

Opal is the birthstone of October. It is also the stone that celebrates the 14th anniversary of marriage. The name opal is believed to be derived from the Sanskrit word upala, which means "jewel", and later the Greek derivative "Opallios", which means "to see a change in color".

There are two broad classes of opal: precious and common. Precious opal displays play-of-color ([[iridescence]]), common opal does not.<ref>{{cite web |title=Opal Description |url=https://www.gia.edu/opal-description |website=Gemological Institute of America |access-date=4 June 2018}}</ref> Play-of-color is defined as "a pseudo chromatic optical effect resulting in flashes of colored light from certain minerals, as they are turned in white light."<ref>{{cite web |title=Glossary: Play of Color |url=https://www.mindat.org/glossary/play_of_color |website=Mindat |access-date=4 June 2018}}</ref> The internal structure of precious opal causes it to [[diffraction|diffract]] light, resulting in play-of-color. Depending on the conditions in which it formed, opal may be transparent, translucent, or opaque and the background color may be white, black, or nearly any color of the visual spectrum. Black opal is considered to be the rarest, whereas white, gray, and green are the most common.

Precious opal shows a variable interplay of internal colors, and though it is a mineraloid, it has an internal structure. At microscopic scales, precious opal is composed of silica spheres some {{convert|150|-|300|nm}} in diameter in a hexagonal or cubic [[close-packing|close-packed]] [[crystal structure|lattice]]. It was shown by J. V. Sanders in the mid-1960s<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sanders|first=J.&nbsp;V.|date=1964|title=Colour of precious opal|journal=Nature|volume=204|issue=496|pages=1151–1153|doi=10.1038/2041151a0|bibcode=1964Natur.204.1151S|s2cid=4169953}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sanders|first=J.&nbsp;V.|date=1968|title=Diffraction of light by opals|journal=Acta Crystallographica A|volume=24|issue=4|pages=427–434|doi=10.1107/S0567739468000860|bibcode=1968AcCrA..24..427S}}</ref> that these ordered silica spheres produce the internal colors by causing the [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]] and [[diffraction]] of light passing through the microstructure of the opal.<ref name=Klein>{{cite book|last1=Klein|first1=Cornelis|last2=Hurlbut|first2=Cornelius S.|date=1985|title=Manual of Mineralogy|edition=20th|isbn=978-0-471-80580-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/manualofmineralo00klei}}</ref> The regularity of the sizes and the packing of these spheres is a prime determinant of the quality of precious opal. Where the distance between the regularly packed planes of spheres is around half the wavelength of a component of [[visible light]], the light of that wavelength may be subject to diffraction from the [[Diffraction grating|grating]] created by the stacked planes. The colors that are observed are determined by the spacing between the planes and the orientation of planes with respect to the incident light. The process can be described by [[Bragg's law]] of diffraction.

Visible light cannot pass through large thicknesses of the opal. This is the basis of the optical [[band gap]] in a [[photonic crystal]]. The notion that opals are photonic crystals for visible light was expressed in 1995 by [[Vasily Astratov]]'s group.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Astratov |first1=V.&nbsp;N.| year = 1995 | title = Optical spectroscopy of opal matrices with CdS embedded in its pores: Quantum confinement and photonic band gap effects | journal = Il Nuovo Cimento D | volume = 17 | issue = 11–12 | pages = 1349–1354 | last2 = Bogomolov | first2 = V.&nbsp;N. | last3 = Kaplyanskii | first3 = A.&nbsp;A. | last4 = Prokofiev | first4 = A.&nbsp;V. | last5 = Samoilovich | first5 = L.&nbsp;A. | last6 = Samoilovich | first6 = S.&nbsp;M. | last7 = Vlasov | first7 = Yu.&nbsp;A. | doi=10.1007/bf02457208|bibcode = 1995NCimD..17.1349A |s2cid=121167426}}</ref> In addition, microfractures may be filled with secondary silica and form thin [[lamella (materials)|lamella]]e inside the opal during solidification. The term [[opalescence]] is commonly used to describe this unique and beautiful phenomenon, which in gemology is termed [[iridescence|play of color]]. In gemology, opalescence is applied to the hazy-milky-[[turbidity|turbid]] sheen of common or potch opal which does not show a play of color. [[Opalescence]] is a form of [[adularescence]].

For [[gemstone]] use, most opal is cut and polished to form a [[cabochon]]. "Solid" opal refers to polished stones consisting wholly of precious opal. Opals too thin to produce a "solid" may be combined with other materials to form attractive gems. An opal [[Doublet (lapidary)|doublet]] consists of a relatively thin layer of precious opal, backed by a layer of dark-colored material, most commonly ironstone, dark or black common opal (potch), onyx, or obsidian. The darker backing emphasizes the play of color and results in a more attractive display than a lighter potch. An opal triplet is similar to a doublet but has a third layer, a domed cap of clear [[quartz]] or plastic on the top. The cap takes a high polish and acts as a protective layer for the opal. The top layer also acts as a magnifier, to emphasize the play of color of the opal beneath, which is often an inferior specimen or an extremely thin section of precious opal. Triplet opals tend to have a more artificial appearance and are not classed as precious gemstones. Jewelry applications of precious opal can be somewhat limited by opal's sensitivity to heat due primarily to its relatively high water content and predisposition to scratching.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Dr. Joel Arem |author2=Donald Clark, CSM IMG |url=http://www.gemsociety.org/article/opal-jewelry-and-gemstone-information/ |title=Opal Value, Price, and Jewelry |website=Gemsociety.org |date=2015-06-23 |access-date=2016-11-22 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123060711/https://www.gemsociety.org/article/opal-jewelry-and-gemstone-information/ |archive-date=23 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
Combined with modern techniques of polishing, a doublet opal can produce a similar effect to solid black or boulder opal at a fraction of the price. Doublet opal also has the added benefit of having genuine opal as the top visible and touchable layer, unlike triplet opals.

Besides the [[gemstone]] varieties that show a play of color, the other kinds of common opal include the milk opal, milky bluish to greenish (which can sometimes be of gemstone quality); [[resin]] opal, which is honey-yellow with a resinous luster; [[wood opal]], which is caused by the replacement of the organic material in wood with opal;<ref>{{cite book|last=Gribble|first=C.&nbsp;D.|title=Rutley's Elements of Mineralogy|publisher=Unwin Hyman|location=London|year=1988|edition=27th|page=431|chapter=Tektosilicates (framework silicates)|isbn=978-0-04-549011-0}}</ref> [[menilite]], which is brown or grey; [[hyalite]], a colorless glass-clear opal sometimes called Muller's glass; [[geyserite]], also called [[siliceous sinter]], deposited around [[hot springs]] or [[geyser]]s; and [[diatomaceous earth]], the accumulations of [[diatom]] shells or tests. Common opal often displays a hazy-milky-[[turbidity|turbid]] sheen from within the stone. In [[gemology]], this optical effect is strictly defined as [[opalescence]] which is a form of [[adularescence]].

Fire opal is a transparent to translucent opal, with warm body colors of yellow to orange to red. Although it does not usually show any play of color, occasionally a stone will exhibit bright green flashes. The most famous source of fire opals is the state of [[Querétaro]] in Mexico; these opals are commonly called Mexican fire opals. Fire opals that do not show a play of color are sometimes referred to as jelly opals. Mexican opals are sometimes cut in their rhyolitic host material if it is hard enough to allow cutting and polishing. This type of Mexican opal is referred to as a Cantera opal. Also, a type of opal from Mexico, referred to as Mexican water opal, is a colorless opal which exhibits either a bluish or golden internal sheen.<ref name="LetsTalk">{{cite web|first1=James|last1=Swisher|first2=Edna B.|last2=Anthony|url=http://www.attawaygems.com/NMFG/Lets_talk_gemstones_opal.htm|title=Let's Talk Gemstones: Opal|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107214533/http://www.attawaygems.com/NMFG/Lets_talk_gemstones_opal.htm|archive-date=7 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Girasol opal is a term sometimes mistakenly and improperly used to refer to fire opals, as well as a type of transparent to semitransparent type milky quartz from Madagascar which displays an asterism, or star effect when cut properly. However, the true girasol opal<ref name="LetsTalk"/> is a type of [[hyalite]] opal that exhibits a bluish glow or sheen that follows the light source around. It is not a play of color as seen in precious opal, but rather an effect from microscopic inclusions. It is also sometimes referred to as water opal, too, when it is from Mexico. The two most notable locations of this type of opal are [[Oregon]] and Mexico.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Peruvian opal (also called blue opal) is a semi-opaque to opaque blue-green stone found in Peru, which is often cut to include the matrix in the more opaque stones. It does not display a play of color. Blue opal also comes from [[Oregon]] and Idaho in the [[Owyhee River|Owyhee]] region, as well as from [[Nevada]] around the [[Virgin Valley]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Opal – Nevada Mining Association|url=https://www.nevadamining.org/nvma_minerals/opal/|access-date=2020-06-18|website=www.nevadamining.org}}</ref>

Opal is also formed by [[diatom]]s. Diatoms are a form of algae that, when they die, often form layers at the bottoms of lakes, bays, or oceans. Their cell walls are made up of hydrated silicon dioxide which gives them structural coloration and therefore the appearance of tiny opals when viewed under a microscope. These cell walls or "tests" form the “grains” for the [[diatomaceous earth]]. This sedimentary rock is white, opaque, and chalky in texture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.minerals.net/mineral-variety/mineral/diatomite.aspx|title=diatomite - The Mineral and Gemstone Kingdom|website=www.minerals.net|access-date=2018-05-15}}</ref> Diatomite has multiple industrial uses such as filtering or adsorbing since it has a fine particle size and very porous nature, and gardening to increase water absorption.

==History==
Opal was rare and very valuable in antiquity. In Europe, it was a gem prized by royalty.<ref>"The central stone on the thirteenth-century crown of the Holy Roman Emperor was an opal said to be the color of pure white snow, sparkling with splashes of bright red wine: it was called “the Orphanus,” perhaps because there was no other stone like it.24 And on New Year’s Day 1584,25 Queen Elizabeth I was delighted to receive an opal parure—a full set of matching jewelry—from one of her favorite courtiers, Sir Christopher Hatton."

The primary sources of opal are Australia and Ethiopia, but because of inconsistent and widely varying accountings of their respective levels of extraction, it is difficult to accurately state what proportion of the global supply of opal comes from either country.

The [[Mintabie, South Australia|Mintabie Opal Field]] located about {{convert|250|km|abbr=on}} northwest of Coober Pedy has also produced large quantities of crystal opal and the rarer black opal. Over the years, it has been sold overseas incorrectly as Coober Pedy opal. The black opal is said to be some of the best examples found in Australia.

[[Andamooka, South Australia|Andamooka]] in South Australia is also a major producer of matrix opal, crystal opal, and black opal. Another Australian town, [[Lightning Ridge, New South Wales|Lightning Ridge]] in [[New South Wales]], is the main source of black opal, opal containing a predominantly dark background (dark gray to blue-black displaying the play of color), collected from the [[Griman Creek Formation]]. Boulder opal consists of [[concretion]]s and fracture fillings in a dark siliceous [[ironstone]] matrix.

=== Mexico ===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}

Opal occurs in significant quantity and variety in central [[Mexico]], where [[mining]] and production first originated in the state of [[Querétaro]]. In this region the opal deposits are located mainly in the mountain ranges of three municipalities: [[Colón, Querétaro|Colón]], [[Tequisquiapan]] and [[Ezequiel Montes]]. During the 1960s through to the mid-1970s, the Querétaro mines were heavily mined. Today's opal miners report that it was much easier to find quality opals with a lot of fire and play of color back then, whereas today the gem-quality opals are very hard to come by and command hundreds of US dollars or more.

The oldest mine in Querétaro is Santa Maria del Iris. This mine was opened around 1870 and has been reopened at least 28 times since. At the moment there are about 100 mines in the regions around Querétaro, but most of them are now closed. The best quality of opals came from the mine Santa Maria del Iris, followed by La Hacienda la Esperanza, Fuentezuelas, La Carbonera, and La Trinidad. Important deposits in the state of [[Jalisco]] were not discovered until the late 1950s.

In 1957, Alfonso Ramirez (of Querétaro) accidentally discovered the first opal mine in Jalisco: La Unica, located on the outer area of the volcano of Tequila, near the Huitzicilapan farm in [[Magdalena, Jalisco|Magdalena]]. By 1960 there were around 500 known opal mines in this region alone. Other regions of the country that also produce opals (of lesser quality) are [[Guerrero]], which produces an opaque opal similar to the opals from Australia (some of these opals are carefully treated with heat to improve their colors so high-quality opals from this area may be suspect). There are also some small opal mines in [[Morelos]], [[Durango]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Baja California]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Puebla]], [[Michoacán]], and [[Estado de México]].

=== Other locations ===

Another source of white base opal or creamy opal in the United States is [[Spencer, Idaho]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.eastidahonews.com/2015/08/future-of-spencer-opal-mining-uncertain/|title=If you've ever wanted an opal -- it's time to visit Spencer {{!}} East Idaho News|date=2015-08-06|work=East Idaho News|access-date=2018-02-14}}</ref> A high percentage of the opal found there occurs in thin layers.

Other significant deposits of precious opal around the world can be found in the Czech Republic, Canada, Slovakia, Hungary, Turkey, Indonesia, Brazil (in [[Pedro II, Piauí]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mindat.org/gallery.php?loc=8782 |title=Boi Morto Mine, Pedro II, Piauí, Brazil |website=Mindat.org |access-date=8 October 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512015022/http://www.mindat.org/gallery.php?loc=8782 |archive-date=12 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), Honduras (more precisely in [[Erandique]]), Guatemala and Nicaragua.

In late 2008, [[NASA]] announced it had discovered opal deposits on [[Mars]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2008-198|title=NASA probe finds opals in Martian crevices|access-date=29 October 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119103930/http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2008-198|archive-date=19 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

== Synthetic opal ==
Opals of all varieties have been synthesized experimentally and commercially. The discovery of the ordered sphere structure of precious opal led to its synthesis by Pierre Gilson in 1974.<ref name=Klein /> The resulting material is distinguishable from natural opal by its regularity; under magnification, the patches of color are seen to be arranged in a "lizard skin" or "chicken wire" pattern. Furthermore, synthetic opals do not [[fluorescence|fluoresce]] under [[ultraviolet]] light. Synthetics are also generally lower in density and are often highly porous.

Opals which have been created in a laboratory are often termed "lab-created opals", which, while classifiable as man-made and synthetic, are very different from their resin-based counterparts which are also considered man-made and synthetic.The term "synthetic" implies that a stone has been created to be chemically and structurally indistinguishable from a genuine one, and genuine opal contains no resins or polymers. The finest modern lab-created opals do not exhibit the lizard skin or columnar patterning of earlier lab-created varieties, and their patterns are non-directional. They can still be distinguished from genuine opals, however, by their lack of [[Inclusion (mineral)|inclusions]] and the absence of any surrounding non-opal [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]]. While many genuine opals are cut and polished without a matrix, the presence of irregularities in their play-of-color continues to mark them as distinct from even the best lab-created synthetics.

Other research in macroporous structures have yielded highly ordered materials that have similar optical properties to opals and have been used in cosmetics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.license.umn.edu/Products/Highly-Ordered-Macroporous-Structures__99014.aspx |title=Macroporous Structures, Metal Oxides, Highly Ordered |website=Office for Technology Commercialization, Technology Marketing Site |publisher=University of Minnesota |date=25 June 2010 |access-date=8 October 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324152153/http://www.license.umn.edu/Products/Highly-Ordered-Macroporous-Structures__99014.aspx |archive-date=24 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Synthetic opals are also deeply investigated in [[photonics]] for sensing and light management purposes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lova |first1=Paola |last2=Congiu |first2=Simone |last3=Sparnacci |first3=Katia |last4=Angelini |first4=Angelo |last5=Boarino |first5=Luca |last6=Laus |first6=Michele |last7=Stasio |first7=Francesco Di |last8=Comoretto |first8=Davide |title=Core–shell silica–rhodamine B nanosphere for synthetic opals: from fluorescence spectral redistribution to sensing |journal=RSC Advances |date=8 April 2020 |volume=10 |issue=25 |pages=14958–14964 |doi=10.1039/D0RA02245D |issn=2046-2069|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tétreault |first1=N. |last2=Míguez |first2=H. |last3=Ozin |first3=G.

== Local atomic structure of opals ==
[[File:Alphacrist.png|thumb|The crystal structure of crystalline α-[[cristobalite]]. Locally, the structures of some opals, opal-C, are similar to this.]]
[[File:Lussatite-France.jpg|thumb|Lussatite (opal-CT)]]
The lattice of spheres of opal that cause interference with light is several hundred times larger than the fundamental structure of crystalline silica. As a [[mineraloid]], no [[unit cell]] describes the structure of opal. Nevertheless, opals can be roughly divided into those that show no signs of crystalline order ([[amorphous]] opal) and those that show signs of the beginning of crystalline order, commonly termed [[cryptocrystalline]] or microcrystalline opal.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Graetsch|first=H.|title=Structural characteristics of opaline and microcrystalline silica minerals. Silica, physical behavior, geochemistry and materials applications|journal=Reviews in Mineralogy|volume=29|date=1994|editor1-first=P.&nbsp;J.|editor1-last=Heaney|editor2-first=Connecticut|editor2-last=Prewitt|editor3-first=G.&nbsp;V.|editor3-last=Gibbs}}</ref> Dehydration experiments and [[infrared spectroscopy]] have shown that most of the H<sub>2</sub>O in the formula of SiO<sub>2</sub>·''n''H<sub>2</sub>O of opals is present in the familiar form of clusters of molecular water. Isolated water molecules, and [[silanol]]s, structures such as SiOH, generally form a lesser proportion of the total and can reside near the surface or in defects inside the opal.

The structure of low-pressure [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]] of anhydrous [[silica]] consist of frameworks of fully corner bonded tetrahedra of SiO<sub>4</sub>. The higher temperature polymorphs of silica [[cristobalite]] and [[tridymite]] are frequently the first to crystallize from amorphous anhydrous silica, and the local structures of microcrystalline opals also appear to be closer to that of cristobalite and tridymite than to quartz. The structures of tridymite and cristobalite are closely related and can be described as [[hexagonal close packing|hexagonal]] and [[cubic close packing|cubic close-packed]] layers. It is therefore possible to have intermediate structures in which the layers are not regularly stacked.

=== Microcrystalline opal ===
Microcrystalline opal or ''Opal-CT'' has been interpreted as consisting of clusters of stacked [[cristobalite]] and [[tridymite]] over very short length scales. The spheres of opal in microcrystalline opal are themselves made up of tiny nanocrystalline blades of cristobalite and tridymite. Microcrystalline opal has occasionally been further subdivided in the literature. Water content may be as high as 10&nbsp;wt%.<ref>[https://www.mindat.org/min-32185.html Opal-CT on Midat]</ref> Opal-CT, also called ''lussatine'' or ''lussatite'', is interpreted as consisting of localized order of α-cristobalite with a lot of stacking disorder. Typical water content is about 1.5&nbsp;wt%.

=== Noncrystalline opal ===
[[File:Schematic silica gel surface.png|thumb|upright=2|Schematic representation of the hydrated opal surface.]]
Two broad categories of noncrystalline opals, sometimes just referred to as "opal-A" (A stands for amorphous){{Citation needed|date=July 2021}}, have been proposed. The first of these is opal-AG consisting of aggregated spheres of silica, with water filling the space in between. Precious opal and potch opal are generally varieties of this, the difference being in the regularity of the sizes of the spheres and their packing. The second "opal-A" is opal-AN or water-containing amorphous silica-glass. [[Hyalite]] is another name for this.

Noncrystalline silica in siliceous sediments is reported to gradually transform to opal-CT and then opal-C as a result of [[diagenesis]], due to the increasing overburden pressure in [[sedimentary]] rocks, as some of the stacking disorder is removed.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://minsocam.org/msa/AmMin/TOC/Articles_Free/1996/Cady_p1380-1395_96.pdf |title=HRTEM of microcrystalline opal in chert and porcelanite from the Monterey Formation, California |last1=Cady |first1=S.&nbsp;L. |last2=Wenk |first2=H.-R. |last3=Downing |first3=K.&nbsp;H. |date=1996 |journal=American Mineralogist |volume=81 |issue=11–12 |pages=1380–1395 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001053527/http://minsocam.org/msa/AmMin/TOC/Articles_Free/1996/Cady_p1380-1395_96.pdf |archive-date=1 October 2011 |df=dmy-all |bibcode=1996AmMin..81.1380C |doi=10.2138/am-1996-11-1211 |s2cid=53527412 }}</ref>

===Opal surface chemical groups===

The surface of opal in contact with water is covered by [[siloxane]] bonds (≡Si–O–Si≡) and [[silanol]] groups (≡Si–OH). This makes the opal surface very [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] and capable of forming numerous [[hydrogen bond]]s.

== Etymology ==
The word 'opal' is adapted from the [[Latin]] term {{lang|la|opalus}}, but the origin of this word is a matter of debate. However, most modern references suggest it is adapted from the [[Sanskrit]] word {{lang|sa-Latn|úpala}}.<ref name=eckert>{{cite book|author-link=Allan W. Eckert|first=Allan W.|last=Eckert|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vGewAkLkmvIC&pg=PA56|title=The World of Opals|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|date=1997|pages=56–57|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426210345/https://books.google.com/books?id=vGewAkLkmvIC&pg=PA56|archive-date=26 April 2016|df=dmy-all|isbn=9780471133971}}</ref>

References to the gem are made by [[Pliny the Elder]]. It is suggested to have been adapted from [[Ops]], the wife of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], and goddess of fertility. The portion of [[Saturnalia]] devoted to Ops was "Opalia", similar to {{lang|la|opalus}}.

Another common claim that the term is adapted from the [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] word, {{lang|grc-Latn|opallios}}. This word has two meanings, one is related to "seeing" and forms the basis of the English words like "opaque"; the other is "other" as in "alias" and "alter". It is claimed that {{lang|la|opalus}} combined these uses, meaning "to see a change in color". However, historians have noted the first appearances of {{lang|grc-Latn|opallios}} do not occur until after the Romans had taken over the Greek states in 180&nbsp;BC and they had previously used the term {{lang|grc-Latn|paederos}}.<ref name=eckert/>

However, the argument for the Sanskrit origin is strong. The term first appears in Roman references around 250&nbsp;BC, at a time when the opal was valued above all other gems. The opals were supplied by traders from the [[Bosporus]], who claimed the gems were being supplied from India. Before this, the stone was referred to by a variety of names, but these fell from use after 250&nbsp;BC.

== Historical superstitions ==
In the Middle Ages, opal was considered a stone that could provide great luck because it was believed to possess all the virtues of each gemstone whose color was represented in the color spectrum of the opal.<ref name=Fernie>{{cite book | last = Fernie | first = William Thomas | title = Precious Stones for Curative Wear | year = 1907 | location = Bristol | publisher = John Wright & Co | pages = [https://archive.org/details/b24855893/page/248 248]–249 | url = https://archive.org/details/b24855893 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> It was also said to grant invisibility if wrapped in a fresh [[bay leaf]] and held in the hand.<ref name=Fernie /><ref>{{cite book|title=Wicca Candle Magick|first=Gerina|last=Dunwich |author-link=Gerina Dunwich |year=1996|pages=84–85}}</ref> Following the publication of Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Anne of Geierstein]]'' in 1829, opal acquired a less auspicious reputation. In Scott's novel, the Baroness of Arnheim wears an opal [[amulet|talisman]] with supernatural powers. When a drop of [[holy water]] falls on the talisman, the opal turns into a colorless stone and the Baroness dies soon thereafter. Due to the popularity of Scott's novel, people began to associate opals with bad luck and death.<ref name=Fernie /> Within a year of the publishing of Scott's novel in April 1829, the sale of opals in Europe dropped by 50%, and remained low for the next 20 years or so.<ref>{{cite book|author-link=Allan W. Eckert|first=Allan W.|last=Eckert|chapter=A Chronological History and Mythology of Opals|title=The World of Opals|location=New York|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|date=1997|pages=53–118}}</ref>

Even as recently as the beginning of the 20th century, it was believed that when a Russian saw an opal among other goods offered for sale, he or she should not buy anything more, as the opal was believed to embody the [[evil eye]].<ref name=Fernie />

Opal is considered the [[birthstone]] for people born in October.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Goldberg-Gist|first1=Arlene|title=What's that Stuff?
