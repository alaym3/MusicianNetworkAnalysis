===Fortunate Fall Records===
Wanting to steer her music closer to liturgical and worship music and attracted by the economic advantages of independent production, Audrey Assad parted ways with Sparrow Records "on good terms".<ref name="ChristianityToday">{{Cite magazine |last=Stafford |first=Patrick |date=April 2, 2013 |title=Audrey Assad Shifts Gears |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2013/april-web-only/audrey-assad-shifts-gears.html |magazine=[[Christianity Today]] |access-date=March 3, 2015}}</ref> Assad ran a [[Kickstarter]] campaign with the help of her husband that reached double its goal by its finish on April 15, 2013.<ref name="KickstarterPage">{{Cite web |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/56618327/audrey-assads-first-indie-record |title=Audrey Assad's First Indie Record |access-date=March 13, 2015}}</ref> The proceeds paid for Assad's third studio album, ''[[Fortunate Fall (album)|Fortunate Fall]]'', which Assad produced herself under the name "Fortunate Fall Records", as well as a live concert EP, ''O Happy Fault'', and a film of the concert.

Assad released her second independent album, [[Inheritance (Audrey Assad album)|''Inheritance'']], on February 12, 2016.
