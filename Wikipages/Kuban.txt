'''Kuban''' ([[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: Кубань; {{lang-ady|Пшызэ}}) is a geographic region of Southern [[Russia]] surrounding the [[Kuban River]], on the [[Black Sea]] between the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe|Don Steppe]], the [[Volga Delta]] and the [[Caucasus]], and separated from the [[Crimean Peninsula]] to the west by the [[Kerch Strait]]. [[Krasnodar Krai]] is often referred to as "Kuban", both officially and unofficially, although the term is not exclusive to the krai and accommodates the republics of [[Adygea]], [[Karachay-Cherkessia]], and parts of [[Stavropol Krai]].

==Cossack settlement==
The settlement of Kuban and of the adjacent Black Sea region occurred gradually for over a century, and was heavily influenced by the outcomes of the conflicts between Russia and [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref name="KubanATS">Azarenkova et al., pp.&nbsp;8ff.</ref>  In the mid-18th century, the area was predominantly settled by the mountainous [[Adyghe people|Adyghe tribes]].<ref name="KubanATS" />  After the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)|Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774]], the population of the area started to show more pro-Russian tendencies.<ref name="KubanATS" />

In order to stop Turkish ambitions to use Kuban region to facilitate the return of the [[Crimea]], Russia started to establish a network of fortifications along the Kuban River in the 1770s.<ref name="KubanATS" />  After the Russian annexation of the Crimea, right-bank Kuban, and [[Taman Peninsula|Taman]] in 1783, the Kuban River became the border of the Russian Empire.<ref name="KubanATS" />  New fortresses were built on the Kuban in the 1780s–1790s.<ref name="KubanATS" />

Until the 1790s, these fortresses and the abandoned [[Cossacks|Cossack]] settlements on the [[Laba River]] and in Taman remained the only indication of Russian presence in the area.<ref name="KubanATS" />  More intensive settlement started in 1792–1794, when [[Black Sea Cossack Host]] and [[Don Cossacks]] were re-settled to this area by the Russian government in order to strengthen the southern borders.<ref name="KubanATS" />

In the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th centuries, the right bank of the [[Kuban River]] was settled.<ref name="KubanATS" /> At the same time, first settlements appear on the coast of the Black Sea and on the [[plain]] between the Kuban and [[Bolshaya Laba River]]s.<ref name="KubanATS" /> During the second half of the 19th century, the settlement rate intensified, and the territory was administratively organized into [[Kuban Oblast]] and [[Black Sea Okrug]] (which later became [[Black Sea Governorate]]).<ref name="KubanATS" />

The location of the territory along the border had a significant effect on its administrative division, which incorporated the elements of civil and military governments.<ref name="KubanATS" />
