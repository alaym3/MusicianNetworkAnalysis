'''Zen Café''' is a Finnish rock band that was founded in [[Turku]] in 1992. The band derived its name from the book ''[[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]]'' by [[Robert M. Pirsig]] at the suggestion of band's [[bassist]] Kari Nylander. Other original members were Samuli Putro (vocals, guitar), Mikko Oesch (guitar) and Tuomo Mäkipaavola (drums). Oesch soon left the group and Mäki-paavola was replaced by Pete Parkkonen (drums). Their latest album ''Stop'' was released in 2006, after which the band began a long hiatus without officially disbanding.

Meanwhile, band members are following their own personal projects. Lead vocalist Samuli Putro has released four solo albums, an EP, and a number of singles. Two of his albums have topped the Finnish albums chart.
