==History==
===2005–2008: Beginnings===
[[File:Hurts at MICHALSKY StyleNite.jpg|thumb|Hurts performing in January 2010]]
Anderson (born 14 May 1981 in [[Manchester]]) and Hutchcraft (born 30 August 1986 in [[Richmond, North Yorkshire]]) met outside Manchester's 42nd Street nightclub in November 2005, standing by while their friends got involved in a fight.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} Too drunk to join in, they began discussing music instead; realising they had similar tastes, they decided to start a band. Over the next few months, they exchanged music and lyrics via e-mail, before forming Bureau in March 2006. They performed their first gig as a quintet in May at The Music Box in Manchester, and were shortly afterwards signed to independent record label High Voltage Sounds.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.highvoltagesounds.co.uk/hv07012.htm | title=Bureau | publisher=High Voltage Sounds | access-date=30 August 2011 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723195643/http://www.highvoltagesounds.co.uk/hv07012.htm | archive-date=23 July 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> They released their first [[double A-side]] single "After Midnight"/"Dollhouse" in November, which was made Single of the Week on [[Xfm]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.citylife.co.uk/news_and_reviews/reviews/10006820_bureau___after_midnight_doll_house__high_voltage_sounds_ | title=Bureau – After Midnight/Doll House (High Voltage Sounds) | work=Greater Manchester's CityLife | date=11 October 2006 | access-date=30 August 2011 | first=Paul | last=O'Brien}}</ref> In 2007, Bureau disbanded and Hutchcraft and Anderson formed the band Daggers soon after. They signed to [[Label Fandango]] and in October released another double A-side single, "Money"/"Magazine", which, despite failing to chart, was nominated for the [[Popjustice £20 Music Prize]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popjustice.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2924 |title=Twenty Quid Music Prize: tonight! |work=Popjustice |date=9 September 2008 |access-date=30 August 2011}}</ref>

Throughout 2008, Daggers continued to build a following and began working with producers [[Richard Stannard (songwriter)|Biff Stannard]] and [[Richard X]], but after a disastrous A&R showcase in [[London]] in September, Theo and Adam returned to Manchester to reflect on the band's future. They recorded a mournful ballad called "Unspoken" together and they immediately realised that this was the sound that they wanted to develop as a duo. After informing the rest of the band that it was finished, they went on a short break to [[Verona]] in Italy, where they claim they discovered a musical genre called "Disco Lento".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rca-records.co.uk/artists/hurts/ | title=Hurts | publisher=RCA Label Group (UK) | access-date=30 August 2011 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014064343/http://www.rca-records.co.uk/artists/hurts/ | archive-date=14 October 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Daggers split on 30 January 2009.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.myspace.com/daggersuk/blog | title=Goodbye | publisher=Myspace | work=Daggers' blog | date=30 January 2009 | access-date=30 August 2011}}</ref>

===2009–2012: ''Happiness''===
Now called Hurts, the duo recorded an amateur music video for a song called "[[Wonderful Life (Hurts song)|Wonderful Life]]", with a female dancer who had responded to an advert they placed in a post office in Manchester.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://thecollectivereview.com/von-von-lamunu/hurts-interview.html | title=Hurts Interview | work=The Collective Review | date=8 July 2010 | access-date=30 August 2011 | first=Von Von | last=Lamunu}}</ref> After they uploaded the video to their [[YouTube]] channel on 21 April 2009, it quickly went [[viral video|viral]] and has since had over 38 million views. In July, the band was signed to [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]] subsidiary [[RCA Records]] as well as RCA imprint Major Label Records, run by their old friend Biff Stannard.<ref name="independent-hurts-locker">{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/hurts-locker-offers-emotional-rescue-1996865.html | title=Hurts' locker offers emotional rescue | work=The Independent | date=11 June 2010 | access-date=30 August 2011 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://worrapolava.blogspot.com/2009/09/hurts-are-signed-to-rca.html|title=HURTS are signed to RCA|website=worrapolava.blogspot.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/au/artist/hurts/id364607851|title=Hurts on Apple Music|website=Apple Music}}</ref>

Although Hutchcraft and Anderson had decided to not do any gigs until they had enough songs, they began uploading demos to their Myspace page, and on 27 July 2009, they were named Band of the Day by ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jul/27/new-band-hurts | title=New band of the day – No 593: Hurts | work=Guardian | access-date=30 August 2011 | first=Paul | last=Lester | location=London | date=27 July 2009}}</ref> On 7 December, they made the longlist of the [[Sound of...|Sound of 2010]], an annual poll of music critics and industry figures conducted by the [[BBC]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8388581.stm | title=BBC Sound of 2010: Hurts | work=BBC News | date=7 December 2009 | access-date=30 August 2011}}</ref> Following spot plays on [[BBC Radio 1]] of "Wonderful Life", Hurts were invited to record at London's [[Maida Vale Studios]] on 9 December for [[Huw Stephens]]' radio show, where they performed "Illuminated" and "Silver Lining".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00p67b1 | title=Radio 1 Programmes – Huw Stephens, Hurts in session and the nations unite! | publisher=BBC | date=10 December 2009 | access-date=30 August 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Hurts Live.jpg|thumb|right|Hurts performing in October 2010]]
2010 began with Hurts finishing fourth on the Sound of 2010 poll, behind [[Ellie Goulding]], [[Marina and the Diamonds]], and [[Delphic (band)|Delphic]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8439832.stm | title=BBC Sound of 2010: Hurts | work=BBC News | date=5 January 2010 | access-date=30 August 2011}}</ref> On 7 January, [[Zane Lowe]] premiered the song "Blood, Tears & Gold" as his "Hottest Record in the World",<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/zanelowe/2010/01/hottest_record_hurts_blood_tea.html | title=Hottest Record – Hurts – Blood Tears & Gold | publisher=BBC | work=Zane Lowe's Hottest Records blog | access-date=30 August 2011}}</ref> and another self-made music video debuted online three days later. Having released a limited edition 12" [[vinyl record|vinyl]] [[picture disc]] of the [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]] remix of "Wonderful Life" on 18 January, Hurts performed their first ever gig as Hurts on 22 January at the Michalsky [[Stylenite]] in Berlin, followed by St Phillips Church in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] on 22 February.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.popjustice.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4468&Itemid=9 | title=Hurts live: HIGHLY AMAZING | work=Popjustice | date=23 February 2010 | access-date=30 August 2011}}</ref> This was quickly followed by gigs at [[Wiltons Music Hall]], London, and in [[Berlin]] and [[Cologne]] in Germany.

In March, "Wonderful Life" was released to radio in various European territories; as manager Matt Vines explained to ''[[Music Week]]'', the aim was to launch the band simultaneously across Europe and Asia. "It's an internationally focused campaign. We're looking at tours across Europe to back up the work we are doing in the UK." The single became a radio hit in countries such as Denmark, Cyprus and Russia throughout the spring. On 10 March, their first UK single "[[Better Than Love]]" was premiered on Huw Stephens' show on [[BBC Radio 1]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00r7p9c | title=Radio 1 Programmes – Huw Stephens, James Yuill and Hurts exclusives! | publisher=BBC | date=15 March 2010 | access-date=30 August 2011}}</ref> After a nationwide tour with the [[Nme radar tour#NME Radar Tour|NME Radar tour]], the song was released on digital download, CD and vinyl formats on 24 May, and debuted at number 50 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].

Following success on Greek radio, Hurts were invited to perform at the [[MAD TV (Greece)|MAD Video Music Awards]] ceremony in [[Athens]] in front of 11,000 people on 15 June.<ref name="independent-hurts-locker"/> Also in June, [[Kylie Minogue]] recorded a verse and backing vocals for the song "Devotion", which was to be included on the band's album. Hurts recorded a performance of Kylie's 1994 hit "[[Confide in Me]]" for newspaper ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''{{'}}s website, and has since been a regular inclusion on their gig setlists. Kylie later returned the compliment by recording a performance of "Wonderful Life" in Radio 1's [[Live Lounge]].

Throughout the summer, Hurts performed at several music festivals including [[V Festival]] and [[T in the Park]] in the UK, [[Pukkelpop]] in Belgium, and SWR3 New Pop Festival in Germany. "Wonderful Life" was released in Germany on 6 August and it debuted at number two on the [[German Singles Chart]]. It was released in the UK on 23 August, where it debuted at number 21, becoming their first UK top 40 hit. The album ''[[Happiness (Hurts album)|Happiness]]'', which had been recorded at Sunshine Dance Studios in Manchester and Pellerin in [[Gothenburg]] with producer [[Jonas Quant]], was released on 6 September. It debuted at number four in the [[UK Albums Chart]], selling 25,000 copies in its first week on sale, which made it the fastest selling debut album by a band in 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.myspace.com/ithurts/blog/539105591 | title='Happiness' fastest selling debut by a band in the UK this year! | publisher=Myspace | work=Hurts blog | date=13 September 2010 | access-date=30 August 2011}}</ref>

In October, Hurts embarked on their first full headline UK tour, performing in [[Brighton]], [[Leeds]], [[Glasgow]], [[Manchester]], [[Birmingham]], [[Bristol]], and [[London]]. Their third UK single "[[Stay (Hurts song)|Stay]]" was released in November, reaching number 50 in the chart.  Meanwhile, in Germany, "Wonderful Life" was certified platinum for sales in excess of 500,000 copies, and they were awarded the [[Bambi (prize)|BAMBI]] award for Best International Newcomer. They were also nominated at the [[MTV Europe Music Awards]] in the Best Push Artist category. Hurts ended 2010 by supporting [[Scissor Sisters]] on their UK arena tour in December, and released a Christmas single called "[[All I Want for Christmas Is New Year's Day]]" for free download on iTunes.

''Happiness'' climbed back into the UK Top 30 albums chart in February 2011 following a second nationwide headline tour, several TV appearances including on [[The Graham Norton Show]], and winning Best New Band at the NME Awards on 23 February, where they also performed "Wonderful Life". A fourth single from the album, "[[Sunday (Hurts song)|Sunday]]", was released in the UK on 27 February and it debuted at number 57, whilst the second single in Germany, "Stay", reached number three. In March, Hurts were awarded Best International Newcomer at the [[Echo (music award)|ECHO Awards]] in Germany. A fifth single, "[[Illuminated (song)|Illuminated]]", was released in the UK on 9 May, entering the chart at number 159, though it had already reached number 68 in September 2010, following its use on trailers for television channel [[Sky1]].

On 26 June, Theo and Adam performed on the [[John Peel]] stage at the [[Glastonbury Festival]], and their full set was broadcast on a loop on the [[BBC Red Button]] channel. Readers of music magazine [[NME]] voted their performance as the best of the festival, putting them ahead of headliners [[U2]], [[Coldplay]], and [[Beyoncé]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nme.com/news/hurts/57725 | title=Hurts top NME poll to find this year's best Glastonbury performance | work=NME | date=2 July 2011 | access-date=30 August 2011}}</ref> They were later voted "Band of the Summer" by the same magazine.  In June 2011 they announced a remix of the track "[[Lonely Lisa]]" by French singer [[Mylène Farmer]].

"Blood, Tears & Gold" was released as the third single in Germany on 7 October, peaking at number 39.  A deluxe CD/DVD edition of ''Happiness'' was released on 31 October. The album eventually sold 400,000 copies in Germany, earning it double platinum status.  It sold 150,000 copies in the United Kingdom, and spent a year on the UK Top 200 albums chart.

Hurts embarked on their first full European tour in October 2011, performing in Ukraine, Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Lithuania, Estonia, Finland, Russia, Belarus, Serbia, Croatia, Italy, Greece, Austria, Switzerland, North Macedonia, and the UK.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ticketdetectives.co.uk/hurts-to-play-european-tour-in-autumn-2011/ | title=Hurts to play European tour in Autumn 2011 | publisher=Ticketdetectives.co.uk | date=8 June 2011 | access-date=30 August 2011}}</ref> They said in interviews that they planned to start writing and recording for their second album after they have completed the tour, but that they might find it more difficult than their first.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nme.com/news/hurts/57581 | title=Hurts at Glastonbury: 'We need to get depressed before we can write new songs' | work=NME | date=26 June 2011 | access-date=30 August 2011}}</ref> On 4 November 2011, Hurts played their last show of their '[[Happiness Tour]]' at [[Brixton Academy]] where [[Kylie Minogue]] joined them on stage to perform "Devotion" and "[[Confide in Me]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kylie.com/news/kylie-a-surprise-guest-at-brixton-academy/ |title=Kylie A Surprise Guest at Brixton Academy &#124; Kylie Minogue |publisher=Kylie.com |date=2011-11-07 |access-date=2013-05-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117070637/http://www.kylie.com/news/kylie-a-surprise-guest-at-brixton-academy/ |archive-date=17 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Hurts have confirmed more festival shows for summer 2012.

=== 2017–2018: ''Desire'' ===
"[[Beautiful Ones (Hurts song)|Beautiful Ones]]", the first single from ''Desire'', was released on 21 April 2017, the one-year anniversary of the death of American musician [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], whom Hurts have cited as an inspiration. The song is assumed to be inspired by the Prince song "[[The Beautiful Ones]]", from his 1984 breakthrough album ''[[Purple Rain (album)|Purple Rain]]''. The video for the song was shot in Kiev and was also released on 21 April 2017. In the video, which plays out in reverse, Hutchcraft portrays a [[drag queen]] who is chased and beaten by a group of men after one of them mistakes him for a woman in a nightclub and subsequently feels that his masculinity has been insulted. On 1 September, the band released another single, "Ready to Go". The video was filmed in [[Horwich|Horwich, Greater Manchester]]. On 22 September, a single titled "Hold On to Me" was released.

''Desire'' was released on 29 September 2017. During the tour for the album, Hurts liked the welcome they received from fans in Russia so much that they extended the tour to include a return to Russia at the end of it. The second part of the tour also saw the duo perform in Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and China. The final concert took place in Bucharest on 22 September 2018.

=== 2020–present: ''Faith'' ===
In May 2020, Hurts blacked out their pictures on their social media profiles and posted links to a [[Telegram (software)|Telegram]] profile, on which they released puzzles leading to the release of a lyric video for "[[Voices (Hurts song)|Voices]]", the first single from their upcoming fifth album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekRcuZVlvpU|title=Hurts - Voices (Official Lyric Video)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=25 November 2020}}</ref> With lyrics inspired by "isolation, desperation, and mania", Hutchcraft said that "Voices" had become "oddly prescient" during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Hurts tell us about dark new single 'Voices': "We've gone back to the essence of who we are" {{!}} NME|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/hurts-on-dark-new-single-voices-new-album-theo-hutchcraft-nme-2669549|date=2020-05-15|website=NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs {{!}} NME.COM|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-05-18}}</ref> On 24 June, they revealed that the upcoming album would be titled ''[[Faith (Hurts album)|Faith]]'' and released its second single, "Suffer".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/hurts-announce-new-album-faith-and-share-huge-single-suffer-2694704|title=Hurts announce new album 'Faith' and share huge single 'Suffer'|website=Nme.com|date=24 June 2020|access-date=23 July 2020}}</ref> On 16 July, they released a third single called "Redemption" and announced that the album would be released on 4 September.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpQ4l_-ZheY|title=Hurts - Redemption (Official Video)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=25 November 2020}}</ref>
