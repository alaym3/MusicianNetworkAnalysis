[[Miaoux Miaoux|Julian Corrie]] (keyboards, lead guitar, backing vocals) and [[Dino Bardot]] (rhythm guitar, backing vocals) joined the band in 2017 after McCarthy left during the previous year, and Audrey Tait (drums) joined the band after Thomson left in 2021. The band is one of the more popular [[post-punk revival]] bands, garnering multiple UK top 20 hits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/article/96926-franz-ferdinand-the-heathers-on-fire|title=Franz Ferdinand: The Heather's On Fire|publisher=The Skinny|date=9 October 2009|access-date=9 July 2011}}</ref> They have been nominated for several [[Grammy Awards]] and have received two [[Brit Awards]] – winning one for Best British Group – as well as one [[NME Award]].

== History ==

=== Formation (2002–2003) ===
[[File:Franz ferdinand.jpg|thumb|130px|right|The [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] inspired the band's name.]]
The band's members played in various bands during the 1990s, including [[The Karelia]], [[The Yummy Fur|Yummy Fur]], 10p Invaders, and [[Embryo (band)|Embryo]]. Alex Kapranos and Paul Thomson met at a party and began a close friendship and played together in Yummy Fur, and subsequently teamed up to write songs. Around the same time, Kapranos taught his friend Bob Hardy how to play bass after being given a bass guitar by Mick Cooke of [[Belle & Sebastian]]. Kapranos met co-guitarist Nick McCarthy, who had returned to Scotland after studying [[jazz]] bass in Germany, in 2001.<ref name="hot scots">{{cite news|author=Hiatt, Brian|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/franzferdinand/articles/story/7662932/hot_scots|title=Hot Scots|access-date=11 January 2008|date=22 September 2005|work=Rolling Stone|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505233241/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/franzferdinand/articles/story/7662932/hot_scots|archive-date=5 May 2009}}</ref>

Once the members came together, they settled on the name Franz Ferdinand for their band. The name was originally inspired by a [[racehorse]] called Archduke Ferdinand.<ref>{{cite news |title=Archduke Ferdinand takes Plate honours |author=BBC Sport |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/1415638.stm}}</ref> After seeing the horse win the [[Northumberland Plate]] in 2001, the band began to discuss [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] and thought it would be a good band name because of the [[alliteration]] of the name and the implications of the Archduke's death; [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|his assassination]] was a significant factor in the lead-up to [[World War I]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Franz Ferdinand |author=Jessica Nikolich and James Hurley |url=http://entertainment.uk.msn.com/music/galleries/gallery.aspx?cp-documentid=148013878&imageindex=8 |access-date=29 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620175509/http://entertainment.uk.msn.com/music/galleries/gallery.aspx?cp-documentid=148013878&imageindex=8 |archive-date=20 June 2009 }}</ref> "Mainly we just liked the way it sounded", said Bob. "We liked the alliteration." "He was an incredible figure as well," continued Alex. "His life, or at least the ending of it, was the catalyst for the complete transformation of the world and that is what we want our music to be. But I don't want to over-intellectualize the name thing. Basically a name should just sound good … like music." Paul offered, "I like the idea that, if we become popular, maybe the words Franz Ferdinand will make people think of the band instead of the historical figure." – talking to ''[[is this music?]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.isthismusic.com/franz-ferdinand-a-classic-itm-interview |title=Franz Ferdinand interview – is this music?|website=Isthismusic.com |date=5 September 2010|access-date=5 September 2010}}</ref>

=== ''Franz Ferdinand'' and international breakthrough (2003–2005) ===
{{Main|Franz Ferdinand (album)}}
[[File:Ff04.jpg|thumb|The band performing in 2004.]]
In May 2003 the band signed to Laurence Bell's [[independent record label]], [[Domino Recording Company]].<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/reviews/franz-ferdinand-darts-pleasure-domino|title=Franz Ferdinand, 'Darts of Pleasure' (Domino) &#124; ''Spin''|work=Spin|access-date=27 November 2008}}</ref> The band moved to Gula Studios in [[Malmö]], Sweden, with [[The Cardigans|Cardigans]] producer [[Tore Johansson]] to record their debut album.

The album, ''Franz Ferdinand'', was released in early 2004, debuting at No.&nbsp;3 in the UK Albums Chart in February 2004, and at No.&nbsp;12 in the Australian album charts in April 2004. The album only reached the lowest levels of the Billboard 200 album charts in the US as of early 2004, but reached the top 5 of the [[indie rock]] chart and the Heatseeker chart for debut artists. After a couple of North American tours and heavy rotation of the "Take Me Out" video on MTV, the album eventually reached No.&nbsp;32 on the Billboard 200 later in 2004, and sold over a million copies in the United States.<ref name="hot scots" /> ''Franz Ferdinand'' received a generally strong positive response from critics. ''[[NME]]'' rated it 9 out of 10, and said that the band was the latest in the line of art school rock bands featuring [[The Beatles]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Who]], [[Roxy Music]], the [[Sex Pistols]], [[Wire (band)|Wire]], [[Travis (band)|Travis]], and [[Blur (band)|Blur]].

On 7 September 2004, the album was awarded the 2004 [[Mercury Music Prize]]. "Take Me Out" gained first place in the Australian [[Triple J Hottest 100]] for 2004, winning more than twice the votes of the second-place entry, with ''[[This Fire (Franz Ferdinand song)|This Fire]]'' and ''[[The Dark of the Matinee]]'' entering at No.&nbsp;24 and No.&nbsp;50 respectively. Franz Ferdinand won an [[Ivor Novello Award]] in 2004 and two [[BRIT Awards]] in 2005. The avant-garde music video for "Take Me Out" earned them a [[MTV Video Music Award – Breakthrough Video|Breakthrough Video]] [[MTV Video Music Award|MTV Award]].

=== ''You Could Have It So Much Better'' (2005–2007) ===
{{Main|You Could Have It So Much Better}}
The band spent much of 2005 in the studio in Glasgow working on their follow-up album, ''You Could Have It So Much Better'', which was released on 3 October 2005. The band initially intended to leave the album self-titled like their debut,<ref>McLean, Craig. "Ferdinand: No Bull". ''Spin''. September 2005.</ref> but they changed it to ''You Could Have It So Much Better...With Franz Ferdinand'' before settling on the final title.<ref>Spitz, Marc. "Franz Ferdinand". ''Spin''. November 2005.</ref> The album's cover design was modelled on [[Alexander Rodchenko]]'s 1924 portrait of [[Lilya Brik]]. The band attempted to broaden its musical range on the album; Hardy said, "There's more to life than disco-beat guitar music".<ref name="hot scots" /> It was generally well received in the press and seen as an album equal to, or better than, their first by most critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/franz-ferdinand/7790|title=NME Album Reviews – Franz Ferdinand: You Could Have It So Much Better|work=[[NME]]|date=28 September 2005|access-date=5 April 2012}}</ref> It entered the UK Album Charts at Number 1 and the US charts at Number 8.

Wells" and the video-clip "Jeremy Fraser" are not featured on the album, recorded in early 2006 during the band's tour of Australia in support of the album). Also included is another video-clip-only single called "Wine, In the Afternoon" which is the B-side to "[[Eleanor Put Your Boots On]]", and was also not featured on the album, but recorded on tour in Michigan.

The fourth and final single from the second album, "Eleanor Put Your Boots On", peaked at number 30.

Additionally, Franz Ferdinand recorded a cover of [[The Fire Engines]]' song "Get Up and Use Me". In return, the Fire Engines recorded a cover of "Jacqueline". The band also took a similar approach with Dutch band [[De Kift]], covering the song "Heisa-Ho" whilst [[De Kift]] recorded a cover of "Love and Destroy" with Dutch lyrics. The cover by De Kift is named "Liefde En Puin" which is the title "Love and Destroy" translated into Dutch. The band has had remixes by electronic artists [[Daft Punk]], [[Hot Chip]], [[Justice (French band)|Justice]], [[The Avalanches]], [[Microfilm]], and [[Erol Alkan]].

The band also performed, played, and recorded with [[Jane Birkin]], covering the [[Serge Gainsbourg]] song "Sorry Angel" for the 2005 album ''[[Monsieur Gainsbourg Revisited]]''. In addition, Franz re-recorded the track "[[The Fallen / L. Wells|Brown Onions]]" for David Shrigley's compilation album ''Worried Noodles''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davidshrigley.com/worriednoodles/newcd.htm |title=New Cd From David Shrigley, Worried Noodles, 2007 |publisher=Davidshrigley.com |access-date=27 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206073012/http://www.davidshrigley.com/worriednoodles/newcd.htm |archive-date=6 December 2008  }}</ref> The band kept instrumentation identical but used lyrics written by Shrigley which include the consistent repetition of the word "No" and occasionally "No brains, no teeth, no legs, no eyes...". [[Hot Chip]], a band who are reported to be a favourite of Franz Ferdinand, also performed their own version of "No" on the same album.

The band 'met' [[Gorillaz]] in December 2005 and interviewed each other for a feature in ''[[The Observer|Observer Music Monthly]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gorillaz-news.livejournal.com/116347.html |title=Franz Ferdinand interview Gorillaz – Observer Music Monthly |access-date=1 April 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507042014/http://gorillaz-news.livejournal.com/116347.html |archive-date=7 May 2006  }}</ref>

At the 2009 NME Awards ceremony, they performed a cover of [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s "[[Call Me (Blondie song)|Call Me]]" with Elly Jackson of [[La Roux]] on guest vocals.

When Franz appeared on Radio 1's [[Live Lounge]] on 6 April 2009 to promote [[No You Girls]], they covered [[Womanizer (song)|Womanizer]] by [[Britney Spears]].

They have also collaborated with [[Marion Cotillard]] for the 2010 Lady Dior campaign. The band wrote the lyrics and plays the music for the song "The Eyes of Mars", while the actress is on vocals. Kapranos noted that it was refreshing working with her as she had a lot of fun going and retrying the song time and time again.

In 2010, Franz Ferdinand contributed to the ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' soundtrack with their adaption of the song "The Lobster Quadrille". Later that year, Kapranos and McCarthy collaborated on the song "Do It Again" with [[Edwyn Collins]] on his album ''[[Losing Sleep (Edwyn Collins album)|Losing Sleep]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/album-edwyn-collins-losing-sleep-heavenly-2083214.html|title=Album: Edwyn Collins, Losing Sleep, Heavenly – Reviews, Music|work=The Independent|date=19 September 2010|access-date=9 July 2011|location=London|first=Simon|last=Price}}</ref>

In 2016 [[Alex Kapranos]] took part in a documentary about Glasgow music and [[Chemikal Underground|Chemikal Underground Records]] called [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5747466/ ''Lost in France'']. The film was directed by Niall McCann and brought Kapranos (along with members of [[The Delgados]], [[Mogwai]] and others) to [[Mauron]], Brittany, to recreate a gig they played when Kapranos was in his earlier band, [[The Karelia]]. The film features Kapranos playing live with [[Stuart Braithwaite]] of Mogwai, and other musicians such as [[Emma Pollock]] and [[RM Hubbert]], and [[Holy Mountain (band)|Holy Mountain]], as well as interviews with Kapranos and his old label-mates. ''Lost in France'' premiered at the [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]] to wholly positive reviews and was called "funny, vital and sobering"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theskinny.co.uk/festivals/uk-festivals/film/alex-kapranos-on-lost-in-france|title=Alex Kapranos on Glasgow's 90s music scene - The Skinny|website=Theskinny.co.uk|access-date=31 March 2019}}</ref> by Scotland's arts bible ''[[The Skinny (magazine)|The Skinny]]''.

The band is notable for its use of [[Russian avant-garde]] imagery in album and single covers designed by Matthew Cooper. Examples include: "You Could Have It So Much Better", which references a 1924 portrait of [[Lilya Brik]] by [[Alexander Rodchenko]]; "[[Take Me Out (single)|Take Me Out]]", which references ''One-Sixth Part of the World,'' also by Alexander Rodchenko; "[[This Fire (Franz Ferdinand song)|This Fire]]" which references ''Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge'' by [[El Lissitzky]]; and "[[Michael (Franz Ferdinand song)|Michael]]", with single art based on ''A Proun'' by Lissitzky. The song "Love and Destroy" was inspired by the scene of disorder made by Margarita, a character of [[Mikhail Bulgakov|Michael Bulgakov]]'s "[[The Master and Margarita]]", in the apartment of the literature critic Latunzky.

Also, in "Outsiders", the lyrics "In seventeen years will you still be [[Camille Claudel|Camille]], [[Lee Miller]], [[Gala Dalí|Gala]] or whatever" are a reference to the lovers of the artists [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Man Ray]] and [[Salvador Dalí]].

=== Music videos ===
Many of the videos to promote the band's singles take inspiration from Russian [[avant-garde]] much like their LP and CD sleeves.

The avant-garde music video for "Take Me Out", directed by [[Jonas Odell]], was inspired by [[Dada]]ism (especially Max Ernst's [[Une Semaine de Bonté]]), [[Busby Berkeley]] choreographies and Russian [[Constructivism (art)|constructivist]] design.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://www.xfm.co.uk/Article.asp?id=16427|title=Franz Ferdinand 'Take Me Out'|work=XFM|access-date=27 September 2014}}</ref> Alex Kapranos explained the many and varied influences behind the 1930s-style promo for second single "Take Me Out": "It's kind of two dimensional in a three dimensional style if that makes any sense. It's a montage of images; ourselves, pictures and things taken from other places and put together in a strange, abstract way. That's what gives the video that strange, jerky, style".<ref name=autogenerated2 />

The lyrics of "Do You Want To" make reference to parties at the "trendy" Glasgow art gallery Transmission, and the video includes a variety of the work of contemporary artist [[Vanessa Beecroft]].
