==Career==

{{more citations needed|section|date=September 2017}}

===Career beginnings===

At 14, Newton-John formed a short-lived all-girl group, Sol Four, with three classmates often performing in a coffee shop owned by her brother-in-law.<ref name="ilovethatsong1">{{cite web|url=http://ilovethatsong.com/artist/default.aspx?aid=237|title=Olivia Newton-John – Hip-O Records|publisher=Ilovethatsong.com|date=26 October 1987|access-date=10 November 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111223646/http://ilovethatsong.com/artist/default.aspx?aid=237|archive-date=11 January 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> She became a regular on local Australian radio and television shows including [[HSV (TV station)|HSV-7]]'s ''[[Happy Hammond|The Happy Show]]'' where she performed as "Lovely Livvy".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Campbell |first1=Amy |title=Olivia Newton-John on Why She Won't Watch The Hopelessly Devoted To You Biopic |url=https://www.gq.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/olivia-newtonjohn-on-the-onj-wellness-walk-and-why-she-wont-watch-the-hopelessly-devoted-to-you-biopic/news-story/642852b731a2bcc50ecd4b9fa29abeca |access-date=5 August 2019 |work=GQ |date=5 September 2018}}</ref>

She also appeared on ''[[The Go!! Show]]'' where she met future duet partner, singer [[Pat Carroll (singer)|Pat Carroll]], and future music producer, [[John Farrar]] (Carroll and Farrar would later marry). She entered and won a talent contest on the television program ''[[Sing, Sing, Sing (TV series)|Sing, Sing, Sing]]'', hosted by 1960s Australian icon [[Johnny O'Keefe]], performing the songs "[[Anyone Who Had a Heart (song)|Anyone Who Had a Heart]]" and "[[Everything's Coming Up Roses]]". She was initially reluctant to use the prize she had won, a trip to Great Britain, but travelled there nearly a year later after her mother encouraged her to broaden her horizons.<ref name="books.google.com" />

Newton-John recorded her first single, "Till You Say You'll Be Mine", in Britain for [[Decca Records]] in 1966.<ref name="books.google.com" /> While in Britain, Newton-John missed her then-boyfriend, [[Ian Turpie]], with whom she had co-starred in an Australian telefilm, ''[[Funny Things Happen Down Under]]''. She repeatedly booked trips back to Australia that her mother would subsequently cancel.<ref name="ilovethatsong1" />

Newton-John's outlook changed when Pat Carroll moved to the UK. The two formed a duo called "Pat and Olivia" and toured nightclubs in Europe. (In one incident, they were booked at [[Paul Raymond's Revue]] in [[Soho]], London. Dressed primly in frilly, high-collared dresses, they were unaware that this was a [[strip club]] until they began to perform onstage.)<ref name="classic bands.com">{{cite web|author=Pore-Lee-Dunn Productions|url=http://www.classicbands.com/olivia.html|title=Olivia Newton-John|publisher=Classicbands.com|date=26 September 1948|access-date=13 August 2010}}"</ref> After Carroll's visa expired, forcing her to return to Australia, Newton-John remained in Britain to pursue solo work until 1975.<ref name="classic bands.com" />

Newton-John was recruited for the group Toomorrow,<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web|url=https://people.com/archive/cover-story-pops-hottest-pipes-vol-3-no-7/|title=Pop's Hottest Pipes|website=People|first=Robert|last=Windeler|date=24 February 1975|access-date=10 November 2008}}</ref> formed by American producer [[Don Kirshner]]. In 1970, the group starred in a "science fiction musical" [[Toomorrow (film)|film]] and recorded an accompanying [[Toomorrow (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]], on [[RCA Records]], both named after the group. That same year the group made two single recordings, "You're My Baby Now"/"Goin' Back" and "I Could Never Live Without Your Love"/"Roll Like a River". Neither track became a chart success and the project failed with the group disbanding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlyolivia.com/visual/toomorrow/index.html|website=Only Olivia|title=Olivia Newton-John movie Toomorrow|access-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref>

===Early success===

Newton-John released her first solo album, ''[[If Not for You (album)|If Not for You]]'' (US No. 158 Pop), in 1971. (In the UK, the album was known as ''Olivia Newton-John''.) The [[If Not for You|title track]], written by [[Bob Dylan]] and previously recorded by former [[The Beatles|Beatle]] [[George Harrison]] for his 1970 album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'', was her first international hit (US No. 25 Pop, No. 1 [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]]/"AC").<ref name="ONJ.com_bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.olivianewton-john.com/bio.html|title=Olivia Newton-John Biography|publisher=Olivianewton-john.com|access-date=13 August 2010}}</ref> Her follow-up single, "[[Banks of the Ohio]]", was a top 10 hit in the UK and Australia. She was voted Best British Female Vocalist two years in a row by the magazine ''[[Record Mirror]]''. She made frequent appearances on [[Cliff Richard]]'s weekly show ''It's Cliff Richard''<ref name="google1">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgGqNrqfrsoC&q=%22olivia+newton%22&pg=PT499|title=The Billboard book of number 1 hits|access-date=13 August 2010|isbn=9780823076772|last1=Bronson|first1=Fred|year=2003}}</ref> and starred with him in the telefilm ''The Case''.

In 1972, Newton-John's second UK album, [[Olivia (Olivia Newton-John album)|''Olivia'']], was released but never formally issued in the United States, where her career floundered after ''If Not for You''. Subsequent singles including "[[Banks of the Ohio]]" (No. 94 Pop, No. 34 AC) and remakes of George Harrison's "[[What Is Life]]" (No. 34 AC) and [[John Denver]]'s "[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]" (No. 119 Pop) made minimal impact on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]. However, her fortune changed with the release of "[[Let Me Be There]]" in 1973. The song reached the American top 10 on the Pop (No. 6), Country (No. 7),<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eKicir5sZr4C&pg=PA461|title=The Billboard Book of Top 40 Country…|isbn=9780823082919|access-date=13 August 2010|last1=Whitburn|first1=Joel|year=2006}}</ref> and AC (No. 3) charts and earned her a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]] for Best Country Female<ref name="google1" /> and an Academy of Country Music award for Most Promising Female Vocalist.<ref name="ONJ.com_bio" />

Her second American album, named ''[[Let Me Be There (album)|Let Me Be There]]'' after the hit single, was actually her third in Britain, where the LP was known as ''Music Makes My Day''. The record was also called ''Let Me Be There'' in Australia; however, the US and Canadian versions featured an alternate track list that mixed new cuts with selections from ''Olivia'' and also recycled six songs from ''If Not for You'', which was going out of print.

In 1974, Newton-John represented the United Kingdom in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] with the song "[[Long Live Love (Olivia Newton-John song)|Long Live Love]]". The song was chosen for Newton-John by the British public out of six possible entries. (Newton-John later admitted that she disliked the song.)<ref>O'Connor, John Kennedy. ''The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History''. Carlton Books, UK. 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-84442-994-3}}</ref> Newton-John finished fourth at the contest held in [[Brighton]] behind [[ABBA]]'s winning Swedish entry, "[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]". All six Eurovision contest song candidates—"Have Love, Will Travel", "Lovin' You Ain't Easy", "Long Live Love", "Someday", "Angel Eyes" and "Hands Across the Sea"—were recorded by Newton-John and included on her ''[[Long Live Love (album)|Long Live Love]]'' album, her first for the [[EMI Records]] label.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.radioswissjazz.ch/en/music-database/musician/61208199ab67891d8c421c0fa124e2758978f/biography |title=Olivia Newton-John |website=Radio Swiss Jazz|access-date=2 March 2020}}</ref>

The ''Long Live Love'' album was released in the US and Canada as ''[[If You Love Me, Let Me Know]]''. All the Eurovision entries were dropped for different and more country-flavoured tunes intended to capitalise on the success of "Let Me Be There"; the North American outing not only used selections from ''Long Live Love'' but also ''Olivia'' and ''Music Makes My Day'', and only the titular cut was new. ''If You Love Me, Let Me Know'''s title track was in fact its first single and reached No. 5 Pop, No. 2 Country<ref name="books.google.com" /> (her best country position to date) and No. 2 AC. The next single, "[[I Honestly Love You]]", became Newton-John's signature song. Written and composed by [[Jeff Barry]] and [[Peter Allen (musician)|Peter Allen]],<ref name="google1" /> the ballad became her first Pop number-one (staying there for two weeks), second AC number-one (for three weeks) and third top 10 Country (No. 6) hit and earned Newton-John two more [[Grammy Awards|Grammys]] for Record of the Year<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=iAzZZI-jQv4C&q=%22olivia+newton%22&pg=PA4|title=At the Grammys!: Behind the Scenes…|access-date=13 August 2010|isbn=9781423430735|last1=Ehrlich|first1=Ken|year=2007}}</ref> and Best Pop Vocal Performance – Female. The success of both singles helped the album reach No. 1 on both the Pop (one week)<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/notablemomentsof0000warn|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/notablemomentsof0000warn/page/191 191]|title=Notable Moments of Women in Music|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|access-date=13 August 2010|isbn=9781423429517|last1=Warner|first1=Jay|year=2008}}</ref> and Country (eight weeks) albums charts.

In the UK and Australia, "If You Love Me (Let Me Know)" was featured on compilations titled ''First Impressions'' and ''Great Hits! First Impressions'' respectively.

In America, Newton-John's country success sparked a debate among purists, who took issue with a foreigner singing country-flavoured pop music being equated with native Nashville artists.<ref name="autogenerated2" /> In addition to her Grammy for "Let Me Be There", Newton-John was also named the [[Country Music Association]] Female Vocalist of the Year in 1974, defeating more established Nashville-based nominees [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Tanya Tucker]], as well as Canadian artist [[Anne Murray]].<ref name="google1"/>

This protest, in part, led to the formation of the short-lived Association of Country Entertainers (ACE).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Bill|title=50 Country Dissidents Organize New Assn., See Threat to CMA|journal=Billboard|pages=3, 48|date=23 November 1973|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQkEAAAAMBAJ&q=ace+olivia+cma&pg=PT61|access-date=1 February 2011}}</ref> Newton-John was eventually supported by the country music community. [[Stella Parton]], Dolly's sister, recorded ''[[Ode to Olivia]]'' and Newton-John recorded her 1976 album, ''[[Don't Stop Believin' (Olivia Newton-John album)|Don't Stop Believin'<nowiki/>]]'', in [[Nashville]].<ref name="google1"/>

Encouraged by expatriate Australian singer [[Helen Reddy]], Newton-John left the UK and moved to the US. Newton-John topped the Pop (one week) and Country (six weeks) albums charts with her next album, ''[[Have You Never Been Mellow]]''. For 45 years, Olivia held the Guinness World Record for the shortest gap (154 days) by a female between new Number 1 albums (If You Love Me, Let Me Know > Have You Never Been Mellow) on the US Billboard 200 album charts until Taylor Swift in 2020 (140 days with folklore > evermore) [https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/646321-shortest-gap-between-new-no-1-albums-on-the-us-billboard-200-female].   The album generated two singles – the [[John Farrar]]-penned title track (No. 1 Pop, No. 3 Country,<ref name="ReferenceB" /> No. 1 AC)<ref name="google2">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Mo7xm-X1r4C&q=%22olivia+newton%22&pg=PA335|title=All music guide to country: the …|access-date=13 August 2010|isbn=9780879304751|last1=Erlewine|first1=Michael|year=1997}}</ref> and "[[Please Mr. Please]]" (No. 3 Pop, No. 5 Country, No. 1 AC).<ref name="google2" /> However, her pop career cooled with the release of her next album, ''[[Clearly Love]]''. Her streak of five consecutive gold top 10 singles on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] ended when the album's first single, "[[Something Better to Do]]", stopped at No. 13 (also No. 19 Country and No. 1 AC). Although her albums still achieved gold status, she did not return to the top 10 on the Hot 100 or [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] charts again until 1978.

Newton-John's singles continued to easily top the AC chart, where she ultimately amassed ten No. 1 singles including a record seven consecutively:

*"[[I Honestly Love You]]" (1974) – 3 weeks
*"[[Have You Never Been Mellow (song)|Have You Never Been Mellow]]" (1975) – 1 week
*"[[Please Mr. Please]]" (1975) – 3 weeks
*"[[Something Better to Do]]" (1975) – 3 weeks
*"[[Let It Shine (Linda Hargrove song)|Let It Shine]]"/"[[He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother]]" (1976) – 2 weeks
*"[[Come on Over (1976 song)|Come on Over]]" (1976) – 1 week
*"[[Don't Stop Believin' (1976 song)|Don't Stop Believin']]" (1976) – 1 week

She provided a prominent, but uncredited, vocal on [[John Denver]]'s "[[Fly Away (John Denver song)|Fly Away]]" single, which was succeeded by her own single, "[[Let It Shine (Linda Hargrove song)|Let It Shine]]"/"[[He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother]]", at No. 1 on the AC chart. ("[[Fly Away (John Denver song)|Fly Away]]" returned to No. 1 after the two-week reign of "[[Let It Shine (Linda Hargrove song)|Let It Shine]]".) Newton-John also continued to reach the Country top 10 where she tallied seven top 10 singles through 1976's "[[Come on Over (1976 song)|Come on Over]]" (No. 23 Pop, No. 5 Country,<ref name="ReferenceB" /> No. 1 AC) and six consecutive (of a career nine total) top 10 albums through 1976's ''[[Don't Stop Believin' (Olivia Newton-John album)|Don't Stop Believin'<nowiki/>]]'' (No. 30 Pop, No. 7 Country).<ref name="ReferenceB" /> She headlined her first US television special, ''A Special Olivia Newton-John'', in November 1976.<ref name="google1"/>

In 1977, the single [[Sam (Olivia Newton-John song)|"Sam]]," a mid-tempo [[waltz]] from ''Don't Stop Believin','' returned her to the No. 1 spot on the AC (No. 40 Country) and also reached No. 20 Pop, her highest chart placement since "Something Better to Do". By mid-1977, Newton-John's pop, AC and country success all suffered a slight blow. Her ''[[Making a Good Thing Better]]'' album (No. 34 Pop, No. 13 Country) failed to be certified gold, and its only single, the title track (No. 87 Pop, No. 20 AC), did not reach the AC top 10 or the Country chart. However, later that year, ''[[Olivia Newton-John's Greatest Hits]]'' (No. 13 Pop, No. 7 Country) became her first platinum album.

Newton-John was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[1979 New Year Honours]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/47724/supplement/34/data.pdf|title=SUPPLEMENT TO THE LONDON GAZETTE|date=30 December 1978|website=Thegazette.co.uk|access-date=2 January 2018}}</ref> and [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (DBE) in the [[2020 New Year Honours]] for services to charity, cancer research and entertainment.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=62866|supp=y|page=N8|date=28 December 2019}}</ref>

====Lawsuit against MCA Records====

In April 1975, Newton-John and [[MCA Records|MCA]] entered into an initial two-year, four-album deal in which Newton-John was expected to deliver two LPs a year for the record company. MCA also had the option of extending the contract for six more records and three more years; and if the artist did not deliver on time, MCA was allegedly allowed to increase the term of the commitment to account for the lateness.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aPaXqeXEA1wC&q=Newton-JOhn+1978+lawsuit+MCA+Records&pg=PA123|title=Unfree Masters: Popular Music and the Politics of Work|last=Stahl|first=Matt|date=2013|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822353430}}</ref>

Per her new agreement with MCA, Newton-John's first three albums, beginning with ''[[Clearly Love]]'', came out on schedule; however, her fourth, ''[[Making a Good Thing Better]]'', was late. This delay occurred around the same time she was working on ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' for [[RSO Records]], and the postponement arguably gave MCA—which seemed to want to keep its hold on the performer—the right to exercise its option, extend its contract and stop her from signing with another enterprise. Newton-John also did not deliver a "newly optioned" album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/3d/90/18.html|title=MCA Records, Inc. v. Newton-John (1979)|website=Justia Law|access-date=30 August 2019}}</ref>

On 31 May 1978, Newton-John and MCA each filed breach-of-contract actions against the other.  Newton-John sued for $10 million and claimed that MCA's failure to adequately promote and advertise her product freed her from their agreement.  MCA's counter suit requested $1 million in damages and an injunction against the singer working with another music firm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/olivia-newton-john-battles-back-240738/|title=Olivia Newton-John Battles Back|last1=Fong-Torres|first1=Ben|last2=Fong-Torres|first2=Ben|date=27 July 1978|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=30 August 2019}}</ref>

Ultimately, Newton-John was forbidden from offering her recording services to another label until the five-year pact had run its course; however, the original covenant was not automatically elongated, even though Newton-John had not duly supplied the total sum of vinyls indicated in the contract.

As a result of the lawsuit, record companies changed their contracts to be based on a set number of albums recorded by a musician and not a specific number of years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/how-a-rock-bands-lawsuit-could-upend-record-deals-everywhere-1031489|title=How a Rock Band's Lawsuit Could Upend Record Deals Everywhere|website=The Hollywood Reporter|date=25 August 2017|access-date=30 August 2019}}</ref>

[[File:John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.jpg|thumb|upright|Newton-John appearing with [[John Travolta]] in 1982]]

Newton-John's career soared after she starred in the [[Grease (film)|film adaptation]] of the Broadway musical ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'' in 1978. She was offered the lead role of Sandy after meeting producer [[Allan Carr]] at a dinner party at [[Helen Reddy]]'s home.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> Burned by her ''[[Toomorrow (film)|Toomorrow]]'' experience and concerned that she was too old to play a high school senior (she turned 29 during ''Grease''{{'}}s 1977 filming), Newton-John insisted on a [[screen test]] with the film's co-star, [[John Travolta]].<ref name="autogenerated1" /> The film accommodated Newton-John's Australian accent by recasting her character from the play's original American Sandy Dumbrowski to Sandy Olsson, an Australian who holidays and then moves with her family to the US. Newton-John previewed some of the film's soundtrack during her second American network television special, ''Olivia'', featuring guests [[ABBA]] and [[Andy Gibb]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?q=your&p=182&item=B:88509 |title=Olivia |website=The Paley Center for Media |access-date=2 March 2020}}</ref>

Newton-John contends: "I think the songs are timeless. They're fun and have great energy. The '50s-feel music has always been popular, and it's nostalgic for my generation, and then the young kids are rediscovering it every 10 years or so, it seems. People buying the album was a way for them to remember those feelings of watching the movie and feelings of that time period. I feel very grateful to be a part of this movie that's still loved so much."<ref name=":1" />

Newton-John's transformation in ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' from goody-goody "Sandy 1" to [[spandex|spandex-clad]] "Sandy 2" emboldened Newton-John to do the same with her music career. In November 1978, she released her next studio album, ''[[Totally Hot]]'', which became her first solo top 10 (No. 7) album since ''Have You Never Been Mellow''. Dressed on the cover all in leather, the album's singles "[[A Little More Love (Olivia Newton-John song)|A Little More Love]]" (No. 3 Pop, No. 94 Country, No. 4 AC), "[[Deeper Than the Night]]" (No. 11 Pop, No. 87 Country, No. 4 AC), and the title track (No. 52 Pop) all demonstrated a more aggressive and uptempo sound for Newton-John.<ref name="google3">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Mo7xm-X1r4C&q=%22olivia+newton%22&pg=PA334|title=All music guide to country: the …|access-date=13 August 2010|isbn=9780879304751|last1=Erlewine|first1=Michael|year=1997}}</ref> Although the album de-emphasised country, it still reached No. 4 on the Country Albums chart.

Newton-John began 1980 by releasing "[[I Can't Help It (Andy Gibb song)|I Can't Help It]]" (No. 12 Pop, No. 8 AC), a duet with [[Andy Gibb]] from his ''[[After Dark (Andy Gibb album)|After Dark]]'' album, and by starring in her third television special, ''Hollywood Nights''. Later that year, she appeared in her first film since ''Grease'', starring in the musical ''[[Xanadu (film)|Xanadu]]'' with [[Gene Kelly]] and [[Michael Beck]]. Although the film was a critical failure, [[Xanadu (soundtrack)|its soundtrack]] (No. 4 Pop) was certified double platinum and scored five top 20 singles on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref name="google4">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgGqNrqfrsoC&q=%22olivia+newton%22&pg=PT499|title=The Billboard book of number 1 hits|isbn=9780823076772|access-date=13 August 2010|last1=Bronson|first1=Fred|year=2003}}</ref> Newton-John charted with "[[Magic (Olivia Newton-John song)|Magic]]" (No. 1 Pop, No. 1 AC), "[[Suddenly (Xanadu song)|Suddenly]]" with [[Cliff Richard]] (No. 20 Pop, No. 4 AC) and the title song Xanadu with the [[Electric Light Orchestra]] (No. 8 Pop, No. 2 AC).

"Magic" was Newton-John's biggest Pop hit to that point (four weeks at No. 1)<ref name="google4" /> and still ranks as the biggest AC hit of her career (five weeks at No. 1). The film has since become a cult classic and the basis for a [[Xanadu (musical)|Broadway show]] that ran for more than 500 performances beginning in 2007 and was nominated for four Tony Awards including Best Musical.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadway.com/Xanadu-Moves-Up-Broadway-Closing-Date-to-928/broadway_news/571564|title=Xanadu Moves Up Broadway Closing Date to 9/28|publisher=Broadway.com|date=23 September 2008|access-date=10 November 2008}}</ref> (A successful international tour of the show followed.)

In 1981, Newton-John released her most successful studio album, the double platinum ''[[Physical (Olivia Newton-John album)|Physical]]'', which strongly reinforced her image change by showcasing risqué, rock-oriented material. Newton-John explains: "I just wasn't in the mood for tender ballads. I wanted peppy stuff because that's how I'm feeling."<ref name="PeoplePhysical" /> Of the titular cut, Newton-John says: "[[Roger Davies (manager)|Roger Davies]] was my manager at the time; he played it for me and I knew it was a very catchy song."<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/music/2017/04/13/olivia-newton-john-physical-interview/|title=What Made Olivia Newton-John 'Horrified' About 'Physical'|website=EW.com|language=en|access-date=6 September 2019}}</ref> In fact, the [[Physical (Olivia Newton-John song)|title track]], written by [[Steve Kipner]] and Terry Shaddick, spent ten weeks atop the ''Billboard'' Hot 100,<ref name="people1">{{cite web|url=https://people.com/archive/cover-story-olivia-gets-physical-vol-17-no-6/|title=Olivia Gets Physical|website=People|first=Carl|last=Arrington|date=15 February 1982|access-date=10 November 2008}}</ref> matching the record at that time for most weeks spent at No. 1 in the rock era held by [[Debby Boone]]'s "[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]". The single was certified platinum and it ultimately ranked as the biggest song of the decade.

"Physical" earned Newton-John her only placement ever on the R&B Singles (No. 28) and Albums (No. 32) charts.

She pioneered the nascent music video industry by recording a [[Olivia Physical|video album]] for ''Physical'' featuring videos of all the album's tracks and three of her older hits. The video album earned her a fourth Grammy and was aired as an ABC prime-time special, ''Let's Get Physical'',<ref name="people1" /> becoming a top 10 Nielsen hit. Newton-John asserts: "Like everyone, I've got different sides of my personality. I've my dominant self, my need-to-be-dominated self, the sane Olivia and the crazy Olivia. Playing these different characters gave me a chance to show strange parts people haven't seen much."<ref name="PeoplePhysical" />

The success of ''Physical'' led to an international tour and the release of her second hits collection, the double platinum ''[[Olivia's Greatest Hits Vol. 2]]'' (No. 16 Pop), which yielded two more top 40 singles: "[[Heart Attack (Olivia Newton-John song)|Heart Attack]]" (No. 3 Pop)<ref name="google5" /> and "Tied Up" (No. 38 Pop). The tour was filmed for her ''Olivia in Concert'' television special, which premiered on HBO in January 1983.

Newton-John, a [[Carlton Football Club]] fan, performed the [[Advance Australia Fair|Australian national anthem]] at the [[1986 VFL Grand Final]] between Carlton and [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Beveridge|first1=Riley|title=Your AFL club's most famous supporters, from Barack Obama to Cam Newton|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/your-afl-clubs-most-famous-supporters-from-barack-obama-to-cam-newton/news-story/03eb54659866d587cf9c2cc4b9f3d8c5|website=[[Fox Sports]]|date=29 January 2016|access-date=29 January 2016}}</ref>

Newton-John's music career cooled again with the release of her next studio album, the gold ''[[Soul Kiss]]'' (No. 29 Pop), in 1985. The album's only charted single was the title track (No. 20 Pop, No. 20 AC). Due to her pregnancy, Newton-John limited her publicity for the album. The video album for ''Soul Kiss'' featured only five of the album's ten tracks (concept videos for the album's singles "Soul Kiss" and "Toughen Up" as well as performance videos of the tracks "Culture Shock", "Emotional Tangle" and "The Right Moment").{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

After a nearly three-year hiatus following the birth of her daughter Chloe in January 1986, Newton-John resumed her recording career with the 1988 album, ''[[The Rumour (album)|The Rumour]]''. The album was promoted by an HBO special, ''Olivia Down Under'', and its first single, the title track, was written and produced by [[Elton John]]. Both the single (No. 62 Pop, No. 33 AC) and the album (No. 67 Pop) fizzled<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CieMGEblw6kC&q=%22olivia+newton%22&pg=PT225|title=His Song: The Musical Journey of...|isbn=9780823088928|access-date=13 August 2010|last1=Rosenthal|first1=Elizabeth J.|date=March 2004}}</ref> as the nearly 40-year-old Newton-John seemed "old" when compared with the teen queens [[Debbie Gibson]] and [[Tiffany (American singer)|Tiffany]] ruling the Pop charts at that time. (Ironically, this album was praised by critics as more mature with Newton-John addressing topics such as AIDS, the environment and single-parent households.){{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The second single, "Can't We Talk It Over in Bed", did not chart, but was released in 1989 by [[Grayson Hugh]], the song's arranger, as "Talk It Over" becoming a top 20 Pop hit.

===Motherhood, cancer and advocacy===

In September 1989, Newton-John released her self-described "self-indulgent" album, ''[[Warm and Tender (Olivia Newton-John album)|Warm and Tender]]'', which reunited her with producer John Farrar, absent from her previous LP, and also marked a return to a more wholesome image of herself. Inspired by her daughter, who appeared on the cover, the album featured lullabies and love songs for parents and their children.<ref name="google3" /> This album, the last one produced by Farrar, also failed to revive her recording career, as the disc only reached No. 124 Pop.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Newton-John was primed for another comeback in 1992 when she compiled her third hits collection, ''[[Back to Basics: The Essential Collection 1971–1992]]'', and planned her first tour since her ''Physical'' trek ten years earlier. Shortly after the album's release Newton-John was diagnosed with breast cancer, forcing her to cancel all publicity for the album, including the tour. (Newton-John received her diagnosis the same weekend her father died.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.com/archive/toughing-it-out-vol-38-no-5/|title=Toughing It Out|website=People|date=3 August 1992|access-date=10 November 2008}}</ref> Newton-John recovered<ref>{{cite web|url=https://people.com/archive/cover-story-victors-valiant-vol-50-no-15/|title=Victors Valiant|website=People|author=Schindehette, Susan|first2=Karen|last2=Schneider|first3=Anne-Marie|last3=O'Neill|date=26 October 1998|access-date=10 November 2008}}</ref> and has since become an advocate for breast cancer research and other health issues.

Newton-John's advocacy for health issues was presaged by her prior involvement with many humanitarian causes. Newton-John cancelled a 1978 concert tour of Japan to protest the slaughter of dolphins caught in tuna fishing nets.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9CQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT89&lpg=PT89&dq=newton-john+tour+cancel+japan+dolphins&source=bl&ots=FU4YoCWiGX&sig=2gR8KQBiHMsyKq04dNuPl2Hj4QE&hl=en&ei=RMF2TKHjEIKClAe-2JDsCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CBAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q&f=false Billboard, 1978], books.google.com, 1 July 1978.</ref> She subsequently rescheduled the tour when the Japanese government assured her that the practice was being curbed.<ref name="PopMattersPhysical">{{Cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/olivia-newton-john-physical-2613720727.html|title=Making Her Move: Olivia Newton-John's 'Physical' Phenomenon Revisited|date=22 October 2018|website=[[PopMatters]]|access-date=29 August 2019}}</ref> Her concern for these "beautifully evolved creatures" (as she calls them in the ''Warm and Tender'' liner notes) is also expressed in the 1981 self-penned piece, "The Promise (the Dolphin Song)", described as "one of the most tender, heartfelt vocals of the singer's career."<ref name="PopMattersPhysical" /> Newton-John claims "The Promise" (from ''Physical'') was inspired by (and even channeled by) dolphins she met at [[Sea Life Park Hawaii|Sea Life Park]] in Hawaii and attests: "It was strange.

She was a performer on the 1979 ''[[Music for UNICEF Concert]]'' for the UN's [[International Year of the Child]] televised worldwide. During the concert, artists performed songs for which they donated their royalties, some in perpetuity, to benefit the cause. She was appointed a [[Goodwill Ambassador]] to the [[United Nations Environment Programme]].<ref>[http://www.olivianewton-john.com/bio_text.html Biodata], Olivianewton-john.com, 22 June 2012.</ref>

In 1991, she became the National Spokesperson for the Colette Chuda Environmental Fund/CHEC (Children's Health Environmental Coalition) following the death from [[Wilms' tumor]] of four-year-old Colette Chuda, daughter of Newton-John's friend Nancy Chuda. (On the cover of the ''Warm and Tender'' album, the singer is shown with two young girls: one is Newton-John's daughter Chloe and the other, whom Newton-John is kissing, is Colette Chuda.){{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Newton-John's cancer diagnosis also affected the type of music she recorded. In 1994, she released ''[[Gaia: One Woman's Journey]]'', which chronicled her ordeal. Co-produced by Newton-John for ONJ Productions, ''Gaia'' was originally issued by [[Festival Records|Festival]] in Australia but also distributed by various independent labels in Japan and Europe. In 2002, there was an American distribution by [[Hip-O Records]], and a subsequent re-release in 2012 by Green Hill featured an alternate cover photo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.onlyolivia.com/music/albums/gaia.html|title=Olivia Newton-John -> music -> albums -> Gaia|website=www.onlyolivia.com|access-date=20 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.onlyolivia.com/music/albums/gaia_us.html|title=Olivia Newton-John -> music -> albums -> Gaia – one woman's journey|website=www.onlyolivia.com|access-date=20 August 2019}}</ref> ''Gaia'' was the first album on which Newton-John wrote all the music and lyrics herself, and this endeavor encouraged her to become more active as a songwriter thereafter. The single "No Matter What You Do" entered the Australian top 40, and the second single, the environmental-themed "Don't Cut Me Down", was also used in the film [[It's My Party (film)|''It's My Party'']]. The Latin-fueled "Not Gonna Give into It" eventually became heavily showcased in concert performance; "The Way of Love" was featured in the telefilm ''[[A Christmas Romance]],'' and "Trust Yourself" was incorporated into both the TV-movie ''The Wilde Girls'' and the theatrical flick ''[[Sordid Lives]].''

Newton-John was listed as president of the [[Isle of Man]] [[Basking Shark]] Society between 1998 and 2005.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Lloyd|first1=John|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hdtAAAAAQBAJ&q=%22Isle+of+Man%22+%22Basking+Shark+Society%22+olivia&pg=PR3|title=1227 Quite Interesting Facts to Blow Your Socks Off|last2=Mitchinson|first2=John|last3=Harkin|first3=James|publisher=W.

In 2005, she released ''[[Stronger Than Before]]'', sold exclusively in the US by Hallmark. This was her second exclusive album for [[Hallmark Cards]] after her successful first Christmas album '''Tis the Season'' with [[Vince Gill]] five years earlier. Proceeds from the album's sales benefited breast cancer research. The album featured the song "Phenomenal Woman" based on the poem by [[Maya Angelou]] that featured guest vocals from [[Diahann Carroll]], [[Beth Nielsen Chapman]], [[Delta Goodrem]], [[Amy Holland]], [[Patti LaBelle]] and [[Mindy Smith]] – all survivors of or affected by cancer.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/newton-john%20records%20angelou%20poem%20for%20breast%20cancer|title=Newton-John Records Angelou Poem For Breast Cancer|magazine=Contactmusic.com|date=21 August 2005|access-date=10 November 2008}}</ref>

She re-recorded some tracks from ''Grace and Gratitude'' in 2010 and re-released the album as ''[[Grace and Gratitude|Grace and Gratitude Renewed]]'' on the Green Hill music label. The ''Renewed'' CD includes a new track, "Help Me to Heal", not featured on the original album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenhillmusic.com/item/GHD5759_Grace+And+Gratitude+Renewed|title=Green Hill Music-Grace And Gratitude Renewed|publisher=Greenhillmusic.com|access-date=13 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806173427/http://www.greenhillmusic.com/item/GHD5759_Grace+And+Gratitude+Renewed|archive-date=6 August 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> The ''Renewed'' CD yielded Newton-John's first appearances on the ''Billboard'' Christian Albums (No. 36), Christian & Gospel Albums (No. 54) and New Age Albums (No. 2) charts.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

She led a three-week, 228&nbsp;km walk along the [[Great Wall of China]] during April, joined by various celebrities and [[cancer survivor]]s throughout her trek.

===Later career===

Newton-John continued to record and perform pop-oriented music as well. In 1998, she returned to [[Nashville]] to record ''[[Back with a Heart]]'' (No. 59 Pop).<ref name="ReferenceC" /> The album returned her to the top 10 (No. 9) on the Country Albums chart. Its first single was a re-recording of "[[I Honestly Love You]]" produced by [[David Foster]] and featuring [[Babyface (musician)|Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds]] on background vocals<ref name="ReferenceC" /> that charted on the Pop (No. 67) and AC (No. 18) charts. Country radio dismissed the song, though it did peak at No. 16 on the Country Sales chart. The album track, "Love Is a Gift", won Newton-John a 1999 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Song after being featured on the daytime serial, ''[[As the World Turns]]''.[[File:Olivia Newton-John and Stephan Elliott in 2012.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Newton-John and [[Stephan Elliott]] in January 2012 at the premiere of ''[[A Few Best Men]]'' in Sydney]]

In December 1998, following a hiatus of about 16 years, Newton-John also resumed touring by herself and in 2000 released a solo CD, ''[[One Woman's Live Journey]]'', her first live album since 1981's ''[[Love Performance]]'', which was only available in Japan on vinyl pressings.

Newton-John's subsequent secular albums were released primarily in Australia.

For ''(2)'''s 2004 Japanese release, the acoustic version of "Physical" was switched to "Let It Be Me", a duet with Cliff Richard, with whom she had previously been coupled on "Suddenly" and ''[[Songs from Heathcliff]]''.

In 2002, Newton-John was also inducted into Australia's [[ARIA Hall of Fame]].
