The '''Outsidaz''' was an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] collective from [[Newark, New Jersey]], perhaps best known through their affiliation with fellow [[New York metropolitan area|New York-area, New Jersey]] rappers the [[Fugees]] and [[Detroit]]-area rappers [[D12]].

==History==
The group formed in 1991 after underground rappers [[Young Zee]] (born Dewayne Battle) met D.U. (born Brian Bostic) and [[Pacewon]] (born Jerome Hinds) at a New Year's Eve party. At the time they met, Young Zee and Pacewon were rival MCs. Pacewon & D.U. were members of a crew named PNS, while Zee headed a crew named Pskitzo with members Anthony D. Ore (aka Maddfile) and Augustus C. Battle (aka A-Form). They decided to unite into one group called the Outsidaz, following a lengthy microphone battle that it was decided ended in a tie.

Along with Pacewon, D.U. and Young Zee, the Outsidaz consisted of Axe (born Tyree Smith), Denzy (born Denton Dawes), Loon One, DJ Spunk (born Aubrey Polk), S. Coop (born Larry Cooper), Nawshis (born Nathaniel Longchamp), [[Rah Digga]] (born Rashia Fisher), the late Slang Ton (real name Salih Ibn Al Bayyinah Scaife, died in 1999),<ref>http://www.nypress.com/news/newarks-hiphop-outsidaz-FXNP1020000328303289970</ref> Bskills and Yah Yah (born Shakir Nur-al-din Abdullah).<ref>http://music.aol.com/artist/outsidaz/404284/biography{{dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref>

The Outsidaz are affiliated with the Refugee Camp, and made their first commercial appearance as guest artists on the song "Cowboys" off the [[Fugees]] multi-platinum second LP ''[[The Score (Fugees album)|The Score]]''. They were also affiliated with Detroit-based rap collective [[D12]], collaborating with them on different projects. D12 member [[Eminem]] shouts out the Outsidaz at the end of the song "[[Just Don't Give a Fuck]]", in the beginning of "Cum On Everybody", and in the songs "As the World Turns" and "I'm Shady", all of which were released on his major-label solo debut ''[[The Slim Shady LP]]''. He also acknowledges them in a track titled "Till Hell Freezes Over" which was intended to be on the album. A rift developed between [[Eminem]] and Tha Outsidaz when Young Zee and Pace Won each recorded verses alongside [[Bizarre (rapper)|Bizarre]] for the 'Amityville' track on Eminem's major label sophomore, ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]''. [[Dr. Dre]] complained that [[Eminem]] had too many guests on the album, so Pace Won and Young Zee's verses were removed from the track. In a 2015 interview, Pace Won indicated that the original version of the track was probably permanently erased, and as yet, this would appear to be the case, as it has not yet emerged from the vaults.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hiphopdailynews.wix.com/hhdn#!Interview-Pacewon-of-the-Outsidaz-New-Album-Eminem-More/c8o7/54b9e4310cf2ad5dc69f55ef |title=Home &#124; hhdn |website=Hiphopdailynews.wix.com |access-date=March 12, 2020}}</ref> Eminem's [[Shady Records]] label released [[Shady XV]], a compilation album which featured a track titled, "Fine Line" by Eminem. On the song, he spits a verse showing his appreciation for the group (specifically Pacewon and Young Zee).
