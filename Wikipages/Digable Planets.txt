==History==
=== Origins ===
Butler and Irving met in [[Philadelphia]] in the late 1980s. Originally from Seattle, Butler was interning at [[Sleeping Bag Records]] in New York and would visit his grandmother in Philadelphia, where he met local native Irving, who was rapping with a group called the Dread Poets Society.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.okayplayer.com/originals/digable-planets-ishmael-butler-unsung-interview.html|title=Digable Planets' Ishmael Butler Talks About Being 'Unsung,' His Impact & More|last=Danois|first=Ericka Blount |date=3 June 2018 |website=Okayplayer.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180701222728/http://www.okayplayer.com/originals/digable-planets-ishmael-butler-unsung-interview.html|archive-date=2018-07-01}}</ref> Irving had in turn met Vieira, who was originally from [[Silver Spring, Maryland]], while attending [[Howard University]] in Washington, DC.
The initial demos recorded under the name Digable Planets featured only Butler, but after a brief stint with two other members, Butler began collaborating with Irving and Vieira in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|title=Digable Planets|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/48393-Digable-Planets|publisher=[[Discogs]]|access-date=2017-07-01}}</ref>

=== 1992–1993: ''Reachin' (A New Refutation of Time and Space)'' ===
The group signed to Pendulum Records in 1992 and all three band members moved to [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]]. Their debut album ''[[Reachin' (A New Refutation of Time and Space)]]'' was released in 1993 and certified [[Gold album|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. The album's lead single, "[[Rebirth of Slick (Cool Like Dat)]]" became a crossover hit, peaking at #15 on [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' magazine's]] [[Billboard Hot 100|singles]] chart, earning gold certification by the RIAA, and winning [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group|Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]] at the [[Grammy Awards]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/digable-planets|title=Digable Planets |website=Recording Academy Grammy Awards |archive-date=2018-07-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180701220427/https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/digable-planets}}</ref> The track peaked at #67 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in February 1995.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

=== 1994–1995 ''Blowout Comb'' and breakup ===
The group's second album ''[[Blowout Comb]]'' was released in 1994. The album was noted by critics as a stark departure from the previous album, being darker, less hook-oriented and more overtly political in its references to [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] and [[Communist]] imagery. Writing for ''Spin'' in December 1994, Craig Marks declared it "... a beguiling, demanding, damn near revolutionary follow-up."<ref name="answers.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/1994/12/best-albums-1994/140226-digable-planets-blowout-club-web/|title=Digable Planets, Blowout Comb (Pendulum/ERG)|last=Marks|first=Craig |date=31 December 1994 |website=Spin Magazine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180701223245/https://www.spin.com/1994/12/best-albums-1994/140226-digable-planets-blowout-club-web/|archive-date=2018-07-01}}</ref> ''Blowout Comb'' features guest appearances from artists [[Jeru the Damaja]], Sulaiman and [[Guru (rapper)|Guru]] of [[Gang Starr]].

In the same year the group appeared on the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s compilation album, ''[[Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool]]''. The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African American community, was heralded as "Album of the Year" by [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=1994-12-26|title=The Best Music of 1994|language=en-US|work=Time|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,982060,00.html|access-date=2020-05-26|issn=0040-781X}}</ref> The band subsequently disbanded in early 1995 citing "creative differences".
