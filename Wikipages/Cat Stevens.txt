===Musical career (1966–1978)===
====Early musical career====
[[File:Fanclub1966CatStevens2.jpg|thumb|Cat Stevens (Dutch TV, 1966)]]
Georgiou began performing his songs in London coffee houses and pubs. At first he tried forming a band, but realised he preferred performing solo.<ref name="Lifeline1963" /> Thinking his birth name might be difficult to remember, he chose the stage name Cat Stevens, in part because a girlfriend said he had eyes like a cat, but mainly because "I couldn't imagine anyone going to the record store and asking for 'that Steven Demetre Georgiou album'. And in England, and I was sure in America, they loved animals."<ref name="Salon.com">{{cite news|author=Reiter, Amy|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/08/14/cat_2/|title=Salon People: Cat Stevens|work=Salon|date=14 August 1999|access-date=17 October 2015}}</ref>

In 1966, at age 18, he was heard by manager/producer [[Mike Hurst (producer)|Mike Hurst]], formerly of British vocal group [[the Springfields]]. Hurst arranged for him to record a demo and helped him get a record deal. Stevens's first singles were hits: "[[I Love My Dog]]" reached number 28 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]; and "[[Matthew and Son]]", the title song from his debut album, reached number 2 in the UK.<ref name="Biography">{{cite web|url=http://www.yusufislam.org.uk/biography/|title=Yusuf Islam: Biography|publisher=Yusuf Islam official website|access-date=23 September 2008|archive-date=14 October 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014070044/http://www.yusufislam.org.uk/biography/|url-status=dead}}</ref> "[[I'm Gonna Get Me a Gun]]" was his second UK top 10 single, reaching number 6, and the album ''[[Matthew and Son (album)|Matthew and Son]]'' reached number 7 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name="British">Roberts, David (2006).

Over the next two years, Stevens recorded and toured with an eclectic group of artists ranging from [[Jimi Hendrix]] to [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]]. He was considered a fresh-faced teen star, placing several single releases in the [[UK Singles Chart|British pop music charts]].<ref name="Lifeline1967">{{cite web|url=http://www.yusufislam.org.uk/lifeline/0/bdf531e09252cc4c73fc5d84c4138cb3/ | title=Yusuf Islam Lifeline:1967 |publisher=Yusuf Islam official website |access-date=15 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004210047/http://www.yusufislam.org.uk/lifeline/0/bdf531e09252cc4c73fc5d84c4138cb3/ |archive-date=4 October 2011 }}</ref> Some of that success was attributed to the [[pirate radio]] station [[Wonderful Radio London]], which gained him fans by playing his records.

====Tuberculosis====
Stevens contracted [[tuberculosis]] in 1969<ref name="Stereo Review"/><ref name="Disc">{{cite news|author=O'Driscoll, Michelle|work=Disc Magazine|date=29 July 1972|url=http://www.majicat.com/articles/disc72_cat.htm|title=Tea with the Tillerman|access-date=24 October 2008}}</ref> and was close to death at the time of his admission to the King Edward VII Hospital, [[Midhurst]], West Sussex.<ref name="Disc"/> He spent months recuperating in the hospital and a year of [[convalescence]]. During this time Stevens began to question aspects of his life and spirituality. He later said, "to go from the show business environment and find you are in hospital, getting injections day in and day out, and people around you are dying, it certainly changes your perspective. I got down to thinking about myself. It seemed almost as if I had my eyes shut."<ref name="Biography"/>

He took up [[meditation]], [[yoga]], and [[metaphysics]];<ref name="AustralianConcert Programme">{{cite web|url=http://majicat.com/programs/ozprog.htm|title=Cat Stevens 1972 Concert Programme|last=Hely|first=Allan |year=1972|work=Festival Records PTY, Limited |publisher=The Paul Dainty Corporation (Australia) Pty.|access-date=23 January 2009}}</ref> read about other [[religion]]s; and became a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]].<ref name="Salon.com"/> As a result of his serious illness and long convalescence,<ref name="AustralianConcert Programme"/> and as a part of his spiritual awakening and questioning, he wrote as many as 40 songs, many of which would appear on his albums in years to come.<ref name="CBSSundaymorning"/>

====Changes in musical sound after illness====
The lack of success of Stevens' second album mirrored a difference of personal tastes in musical direction and a growing resentment of producer Mike Hurst's attempts to re-create another album like that of his debut, with heavy-handed [[orchestration]], and over-production,<ref name="Scoppa"/> rather than the [[folk rock]] sound Stevens was attempting to produce.  He admits having purposefully sabotaged his own contract with Hurst, making outlandishly expensive orchestral demands and threatening legal action, which resulted in his goal: release from his contract with [[Deram Records]], a sub-label of [[Decca Records]].<ref name="Biography" />

Upon regaining his health at home after his release from the hospital, Stevens recorded some of his newly written songs on his [[tape recorder]] and played his changing sound for a few new record executives. After hiring agent Barry Krost, who had arranged for an audition with [[Chris Blackwell]] of [[Island Records]], Blackwell offered him a "chance to record [his songs] whenever and with whomever he liked and, more importantly to Cat, however he liked".<ref name="AustralianConcert Programme"/> With Krost's recommendation, Stevens signed with [[Paul Samwell-Smith]], previously the bassist of [[the Yardbirds]], to be his new producer.<ref name="Forbes"/>

====Height of popularity====
[[File:Yusuf Islam (Cat Stevens).jpg|thumb|Stevens performing in Böblingen, West Germany, in 1976]]
Producer Paul Samwell-Smith paired Stevens with guitarist [[Alun Davies (guitarist)|Alun Davies]], who was at that time working as a [[session musician]]. Davies was the more experienced veteran of two albums which had already begun to explore the emerging genres of [[skiffle]] and folk rock music. Davies was also thought a perfect fit with Stevens in particular for his "fingerwork" on the guitar, [[Harmony|harmonising]] and his backing vocals. They originally met just to record ''Mona Bone Jakon'',<ref name="Brown">{{cite news|date=5 February 1972|access-date=24 October 2008|publisher=Disc and Music Echo|url=http://majicat.com/alun/catman2.htm |title=Cat's Man}}</ref> but soon developed a friendship.

The first single released from ''Mona Bone Jakon'' was "[[Lady D'Arbanville]]", which Stevens wrote about his young American girlfriend [[Patti D'Arbanville]]. The record, with a [[madrigal]] sound unlike most music played on pop radio, with sounds of [[djembe]]s and bass in addition to Stevens' and Davies' guitars, reached number 8 in the UK.<ref name="British"/> It was the first of his hits to get real airplay in the US.<ref name="Biography" /> It sold over 1 million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold record]] in 1971.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine compared its popularity with that of [[Elton John]]'s ''[[Tumbleweed Connection]]'', saying it was played "across the board, across radio formats".<ref name="RS471">{{cite web|url=http://majicat.com/articles/RS471.htm|title=Cat Stevens Out of a Bag|last=Fong-Torres |first=Ben|date=1 April 1971|via=majicat.com|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=1 March 2010}}</ref>

[[File:Cat Stevens (1972).png|thumb|Cat Stevens (1972)]]
''Mona Bone Jakon'' was the precursor for Stevens' international breakthrough album, ''[[Tea for the Tillerman]]'', which became a Top 10 ''Billboard'' hit. Within six months of its release, it had sold over 500,000 copies, attaining gold record status in the United Kingdom and the United States. The combination of Stevens' new folk rock style and accessible lyrics which spoke of everyday situations and problems, mixed with the beginning of spiritual questions about life, remained in his music from then on. The album features the Top 20 single "[[Wild World (song)|Wild World]]"; a parting song after D'Arbanville moved on. "Wild World" has been credited as the song that gave ''Tea for the Tillerman'' 'enough kick' to get it played on FM radio; and the head of Island Records, Chris Blackwell, was quoted as calling it "the best album we've ever released".<ref name="Scoppa"/> Other album tracks include "Hard-Headed Woman", and "[[Father and Son (song)|Father and Son]]", a song sung both in baritone and tenor, about the struggle between fathers and their sons who are faced with their own personal choices in life. In 2001, this album was certified by the RIAA as a Multi-Platinum record, having sold 3 million copies in the United States at that time.<ref name="riaa">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com |title=RIAA Platinum Ranking|access-date=11 February 2009}}</ref> It is ranked at No. 206 in the 2003 list of "[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]".<ref name="RS500">{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/catstevens/articles/story/6598898/206_tea_for_the_tillerman|work=Rolling Stone|title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time|date=3 November 2003|access-date=24 October 2008|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65jLFMXfy?url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news|archive-date=26 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

After the end of his relationship with D'Arbanville, Stevens noted the effect it had on writing his music, saying, "Everything I wrote while I was away was in a transitional period and reflects that. Like Patti. A year ago we split; I had been with her for two years. What I write about Patti and my family&nbsp;... when I sing the songs now, I learn strange things. I learn the meanings of my songs late ..."<ref name="RS500" />

[[File:Cat Stevens 1974 Moon and Stars.jpg|thumb|Stevens performing in [[Waikiki Shell]], [[Oahu, Hawaii]], 1974. The stage decor reflects his song, "Boy with a Moon & Star on His Head" from ''[[Catch Bull at Four]]''.]]
Having established a signature sound, Stevens enjoyed a string of successes over the following years. 1971's ''[[Teaser and the Firecat]]'' album reached number two and achieved gold record status within three weeks of its release in the United States. It yielded several hits, including "[[Peace Train]]", "[[Morning Has Broken#Cat Stevens recording|Morning Has Broken]]", and "[[Moonshadow (song)|Moonshadow]]". This album was also certified by the RIAA as a Multi-Platinum record in 2001, with over 3 million sold in the United States through that time. When interviewed on a Boston radio station, Stevens said about ''Teaser and the Firecat'':

<blockquote>I get the tune and then I just keep on singing the tune until the words come out from the tune. It's kind of a hypnotic state that you reach after a while when you keep on playing it where words just evolve from it. So you take those words and just let them go whichever way they want&nbsp;...'Moonshadow'? Funny, that was in Spain, I went there alone, completely alone, to get away from a few things. And I was dancin' on the rocks there&nbsp;... right on the rocks where the waves were, like, blowin' and splashin'. Really, it was so fantastic. And the moon was bright, ya know, and I started dancin' and singin' and I sang that song and it stayed. It's just the kind of moment that you want to find when you're writin' songs.<ref name="Crouse">{{cite news|author=Crouse, Timothy|work=Rolling Stone|date=9 December 1971|access-date=24 October 2008|url=http://www.superseventies.com/spstevenscat1.html|title=Cat Stevens on ''Teaser and the Firecat''}}</ref></blockquote>

For seven months from 1971 to 1972 Stevens was romantically linked to popular singer [[Carly Simon]] while both were produced by Samwell-Smith. During that time both wrote songs for and about one another. Simon wrote and recorded at least two Top 50 songs, "Legend in Your Own Time" and "[[Anticipation (song)|Anticipation]]" about Stevens.  He reciprocated in his song to her, after their romance, entitled, "Sweet Scarlet".<ref name="Carly">{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4771736|publisher=[[NPR]]| title=Carly Simon Sings American Classics, Again|author=Stamberg, Susan |date=28 July 2005|work=Morning Edition|access-date=11 February 2009}}</ref><ref name="Carly2">{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/2009/10/18/2009-10-18_carly_simon_revisits_her_hits_on_new_album_never_been_gone_and_spills_about_a_pa.html|title=Carly Simon revisits her hits on new album 'Never Been Gone' and spills about a past love |last=Farber|first=Jim|date=18 October 2009|work=New York Daily News|access-date=6 January 2010}}</ref><ref name="CatStevens songs">{{cite web |url=http://www.majicat.com/photos/Carly_Cat.htm |title=Cat Stevens & Carly Simon|access-date=11 February 2009}}</ref>

His next album, ''[[Catch Bull at Four]]'', released in 1972, was his most rapidly successful album in the United States, reaching gold record status in 15 days and holding the number one position for three weeks on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and [[List of number-one albums in Australia during the 1970s|fifteen weeks at number one]] in the Australian [[ARIA Charts]].<ref name="catchbillboard"/><ref name="catchaustralia"/>

====Film and television soundtracks====
In July 1970, Stevens recorded one of his songs, "But I Might Die Tonight", for the [[Jerzy Skolimowski]] film ''[[Deep End (film)|Deep End]]''.<ref name="Lifeline1970">{{cite web|title=Yusuf Islam Lifeline:1970|url=http://www.yusufislam.com/lifeline/10/a45dd1dc1476115ceb7fa21a45cbcd0f/|publisher=Yusuf Islam official website|access-date=26 September 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707232120/http://www.yusufislam.com/lifeline/10/a45dd1dc1476115ceb7fa21a45cbcd0f/|archive-date=7 July 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

After his religious conversion in the late 1970s, Stevens stopped granting permission for his songs to be used in films. However, almost 20 years later, in 1997, the film ''[[Rushmore (film)|Rushmore]]'' received his permission to use his songs "[[Here Comes My Baby (Cat Stevens song)|Here Comes My Baby]]" and "The Wind", showing a new willingness on his part to release his music from his Western "pop star" days.<ref name="Durrani"/> This was followed in 2000 by the inclusion of "[[Peace Train]]" in the movie ''[[Remember the Titans]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0210945/soundtrack|title=Soundtrack for "Remember the Titans" |publisher=imdb.com|year=2000|access-date=30 January 2009}}</ref> in 2000 by the use in ''[[Almost Famous]]'' of the song "The Wind",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181875/soundtrack|title=Soundtrack for ''Almost Famous''|publisher=imdb.com| year=2002|access-date=30 January 2009}}</ref> and in 2006 the inclusion of "Peace Train" on the soundtrack to ''[[We Are Marshall]]''.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=22 August 2009|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758794/soundtrack|title=Soundtracks for We Are Marshall|publisher=IMDB}}</ref>

====Later recordings====

Subsequent releases in the 1970s also did well on the charts and in ongoing sales, although they did not touch the success he had from 1970 to 1973. In 1973, Stevens moved to [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, as a [[tax exile]] from the United Kingdom; however, he later donated the money to [[UNESCO]].<ref name="guardian.co.uk1">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/mar/29/usa.tsunami2004|title=Music is Part of God's Universe|last=Williamson |first=Nigel |date=29 March 2005 |series=Interview with Yusuf Islam|work=The Guardian |location=UK|access-date=1 February 2010}}</ref> During that time he created the album ''[[Foreigner (Cat Stevens album)|Foreigner]]'', which was a departure from the music that had brought him to the height of his fame. It differed in several respects: entirely written by Stevens, he dropped his band and produced the record without the assistance of Samwell-Smith, who had played a large role in catapulting him to fame. With the exception of some guitar on the title track and "100 I Dream".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Cat-Stevens-Foreigner/release/10109045|title=Cat Stevens – Foreigner|website=Discogs.com|access-date=28 October 2017}}</ref>

His final original album under the name Cat Stevens was ''[[Back to Earth (Cat Stevens album)|Back to Earth]]'', released in late 1978, which was also the first album produced by Samwell-Smith since his peak in single album sales in the early 1970s. Several compilation albums were released before and after he stopped recording. After Stevens left Decca Records they bundled his first two albums together as a set, hoping to ride the commercial tide of his early success; later his newer labels did the same, and he himself released compilations.  The most successful of the compilation albums was the 1975 ''[[Greatest Hits (Cat Stevens album)|Greatest Hits]]'' which has sold over 4 million copies in the United States. In May 2003 he received his first [[Platinum Europe Award]] from the [[IFPI]] for ''Remember Cat Stevens, The Ultimate Collection'', indicating over one million European sales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/plat_month_20030605a.html|title=May 2003 – Platinum Europe Awards|date=6 June 2003|publisher=IFPI|access-date=11 February 2009}}</ref>

===Religious conversion===
While on holiday in [[Marrakesh]], Morocco,{{When|date=June 2021}} Stevens was intrigued by the sound of the [[Adhan|adhān]], the Islamic ritual call to prayer, which was explained to him as "music for God". Stevens said, "I thought, music for God? I'd never heard that before – I'd heard of music for money, music for fame, music for personal power, but music for God!"<ref name="Marrakech">{{cite news|last=Garner|first=Lesley|date=19 April 2002|title=Playing God's Music|pages=Life Articles|work=Evening Standard|url=http://www.yusufislam.org.uk/|url-status=dead|access-date=12 October 2008|archive-date=15 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215121249/http://www.yusufislam.org.uk/}}</ref>

In 1976, Stevens nearly drowned off the coast of [[Malibu, California]], and said he shouted: "Oh, God! If you save me I will work for you."  He stated that, immediately afterwards, a wave appeared and carried him back to shore. This brush with death intensified his long-held quest for spiritual truth. He had looked into "[[Buddhism]], [[Zen]], [[I Ching]], [[numerology]], [[Tarot|tarot cards]], and [[astrology]]".<ref name="Salon.com" /> Stevens' brother David Gordon, a convert to [[Judaism]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/179489|title=Report: Muslim Convert Cat Stevens Has a Jewish Brother|last=Cohen|first=Moshe|date=10 April 2014|work=[[Arutz Sheva]]|access-date=23 November 2016}} Gordon is the co-founder with Yael Drouyannoff of Peace Child Israel, which teaches coexistence using theater and the arts.</ref> brought him a copy of the [[Qur'an]] as a birthday gift from a trip to [[Jerusalem]].<ref name="Durrani" />

During the time he was studying the Qur'an, Stevens began to identify more and more with the story of [[Joseph in Islam|Joseph]], a man bought and sold in the market place, which is how he said he had increasingly felt within the music business.<ref name="Forbes">{{Cite AV media|people = Forbes, Jim (host)| title = Cat Stevens: [[Behind the Music]]|medium=TV series| publisher = [[VH1]]| location = United States|date=  2000}}</ref> Regarding his conversion, in his 2006 interview with [[Alan Yentob]],<ref name="Yentob">{{Cite AV media|title=Yusuf Islam: The Artist Formerly Known as Cat Stevens|publisher=BBC|people=Yentob, Alan|year=2006}}</ref> he stated, "To some people, it may have seemed like an enormous jump, but for me, it was a gradual move to this." And, in a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine interview, he reaffirmed this, saying, "I had found the spiritual home I'd been seeking for most of my life.

Stevens formally converted to the Muslim faith on 23 December 1977, taking the name Yusuf Islam in 1978. Yusuf is the [[Arabic]] rendition of the name Joseph; he stated that he "always loved the name Joseph" and was particularly drawn to the story of [[Islamic view of Joseph|Joseph in the Qur'an]].<ref name="Forbes"/> Although he discontinued his pop career, he was persuaded to perform one last time before what became his twenty-five-year musical hiatus.

===Life as Yusuf Islam (1978–present)===
====Muslim faith and musical career====

Following his conversion to Islam, Cat Stevens (now named Yusuf Islam), abandoned his musical career for nearly two decades. In 2007, he said that when he became a [[Muslim]] in 1977, the [[Imam]] at his mosque told him that it was fine to continue as a musician, as long as the songs were morally acceptable, but others were saying that "it was all prohibited", and he decided to avoid the question by ceasing to perform.<ref name="cbc2007">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/strombo/videos/guest-interview/yusuf-islam-aka-cat-stevens|title=Interview with Yusuf Islam, aka Cat Stevens|last=Stroumboulopoulos|first=George|date=3 January 2007|work=The Hour|publisher=CBC |access-date=8 June 2009}}</ref> He has said that there was "a combination of reasons, really", and that the continuing demands of the music business had been "becoming a chore, and not an inspiration anymore".<ref name="cbc2007"/> In a 2004 interview on ''[[Larry King Live]]'', he said "A lot of people would have loved me to keep singing. You come to a point where you have sung, more or less&nbsp;... your whole repertoire and you want to get down to the job of living. You know, up until that point, I hadn't had a life. I'd been searching, been on the road."<ref name="Larry King" />

====Salman Rushdie controversy====
{{Main|Cat Stevens' comments about Salman Rushdie}}
In 1989, following an address by Islam to students at London's Kingston Polytechnic (now [[Kingston University]]), where he was asked about the [[fatwa]] [[The Satanic Verses controversy|calling for the killing]] of [[Salman Rushdie]], author of the novel ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'', Islam made a series of comments that appeared to show support for the fatwa. He stated "He (Rushdie) must be killed. The Qur'an makes it clear – if someone defames the prophet, then he must die."<ref>Philadelphia Inquirer, 24 February 1989, p.5A, "Iran: West to blame Islam for forthcoming terrorism".</ref> He released a statement the following day denying that he supported [[vigilante|vigilantism]] and claiming that he had merely recounted the [[Sharia|legal Islamic punishment]] for blasphemy. Subsequently, he commented in a 1989 interview on Australian television that Rushdie should be killed and stated he would rather burn Rushdie instead of an effigy.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/Hypotheticals-a-Satanic-Scenario | title=Hypotheticals-a-Satanic-Scenario| year=1989}}</ref> In a statement in the FAQ section of one of his websites, Islam asserted that while he regretted the comments, he was joking and that the show was improperly edited.<ref name="MountainFAQ">{{cite web|url=http://www.mountainoflight.co.uk/talks_cw.html#20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004154204/http://www.mountainoflight.co.uk/talks_cw.html#18|archive-date=4 October 2011|work=Chinese Whiskers-FAQs|title=Yusuf Islam Wants to See Salman Rushdie Burnt, Right?|publisher=Mountain of Light|access-date=1 November 2014}}</ref> In the years since these comments he has repeatedly denied ever calling for the death of Rushdie or supporting the fatwa, a position contradicted by his contemporary public statements in 1989.<ref name="CBSSundaymorning"/><ref name="Dansby"/> Yusuf appearing on BBC's Desert Island Discs<ref name=":0" /> on 27 September 2020 claimed clever journalists had framed his Fatwa comment in a misleading way.

====11 September attacks====
Immediately following the [[September 11 attacks]] on the United States, he said:

{{quote|I wish to express my heartfelt horror at the indiscriminate terrorist attacks committed against innocent people of the United States yesterday. While it is still not clear who carried out the attack, it must be stated that no right-thinking follower of Islam could possibly condone such an action. The Qur'an equates the murder of one innocent person with the murder of the whole of humanity. We pray for the families of all those who lost their lives in this unthinkable act of violence as well as all those injured; I hope to reflect the feelings of all Muslims and people around the world whose sympathies go out to the victims of this sorrowful moment.<ref>{{cite news|author=Dansby, Andrew|work=Rolling Stone|date=17 September 2001|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/catstevens/articles/story/5933040/cat_stevens_condemns_attack|title=Cat Stevens Condemns Attack|access-date=6 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515023427/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/catstevens/articles/story/5933040/cat_stevens_condemns_attack|archive-date=15 May 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/1448948/20010918/stevens_cat.jhtml|title=Yusuf Islam Expresses 'Heartfelt Horror' Over Terrorist Attacks|author=Wiederhorn, Jon|publisher=VH1|date=18 September 2001|access-date=11 February 2009}}</ref>}}

He appeared on videotape on a [[VH1]] pre-show for the October 2001 [[The Concert for New York City|Concert for New York City]], condemning the attacks and singing his song "Peace Train" for the first time in public in more than 20 years, as an [[a cappella]] version. He also donated a portion of his box-set royalties to the fund for victims' families and the rest to orphans in underdeveloped countries.<ref name="boxset">{{cite news|url=http://www.vh1.com/thewire/content/news/1449391.jhtml|title=Former Cat Stevens To Donate Some Box Set Royalties To September&nbsp;11&nbsp;Fund|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|publisher=VH1|date=28 September 2001|access-date=11 February 2009}}</ref> During the same year, he dedicated time and effort in joining the [[Forum Against Islamophobia and Racism]], an organisation that worked towards battling misconceptions and acts against others because of their religious beliefs or their racial identity (or both), after many Muslims reported a backlash against them due in part to the grief caused by the events in the United States on 11 September.<ref name="guardian.co.uk1"/>

====Denial of entry into the United States====
On 21 September 2004, Islam was on a [[United Airlines]] flight from London to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], travelling to a meeting with US entertainer [[Dolly Parton]], who had recorded "Peace Train" several years earlier and was planning to include another Cat Stevens song on an upcoming album.<ref name="Yentob"/> While the plane was in flight, his name was flagged as being on the [[No Fly List]]. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers alerted the United States [[Transportation Security Administration]], which then diverted his flight to [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]], Maine, where he was detained by officers from the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]].<ref name="washpo922">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A39772-2004Sep21.html|title=Cat Stevens held after D.C. flight diverted|author=Goo, Sara Kehaulani|work=The Washington Post|date=22 September 2004|access-date=6 December 2007}}</ref>

However, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) added him to a "watch list"<ref name="musical roots"/> which provoked an international controversy and led the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|British Foreign Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]] to complain personally to the [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]] at the United Nations.<ref name="UN">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3682434.stm|title=Cat Stevens "shock" at US refusal|publisher=BBC|date=23 September 2004|access-date=6 December 2007}}</ref> Powell responded by stating that the watchlist was under review, adding, "I think we have that obligation to review these matters to see if we are right".<ref name="Powell">{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30100-1153665,00.html|title=Powell orders review|publisher=Sky News|date=30 September 2004|access-date=6 December 2007}}</ref>

Islam believed his inclusion on a "watch list" may have simply been an error: a mistaken identification of him for a man with the same name, but different spelling. On 1 October 2004 he requested the removal of his name, "I remain bewildered by the decision of the US authorities to refuse me entry to the United States".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.entertainment-news.org/breaking/8585/yusuf-islam-wants-name-off-no-fly-list.html|title=Yusuf Islam wants name off 'no-fly' list|agency=Associated Press|date=2 October 2004|access-date=6 December 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226155733/http://www.entertainment-news.org/breaking/8585/yusuf-islam-wants-name-off-no-fly-list.html|archive-date=26 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> According to his statement, the man on the list was named "Youssef Islam", indicating that Islam was not the suspected terrorism supporter.<ref name="Larry King"/> [[Romanisation of Arabic]] names can easily result in different spellings: the [[transliteration]] of [[Yusuf]] gives rise to a dozen spellings.

====Libel cases====
=====Lawsuit over News UK newspaper reports that he had supported terrorism=====
In October 2004, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' newspapers voiced their support for Yusuf's exclusion from the United States and claimed that he had supported terrorism. He sued for [[Defamation|libel]] and received an out-of-court financial settlement from the newspapers, which both published apology statements saying that he had never supported terrorism and mentioning that he had recently been given a [[Man of Peace]] award from the [[World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates]]. However ''The Sunday Times'' managing editor Richard Caseby said that while there was an "agreed settlement", they "always denied liability" and "disagreed with Cat Stevens' lawyers interpretation", but took a "pragmatic view" of the lawsuit.<ref name="libel1">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4268651.stm|title=Singer Islam gets libel damages|publisher=BBC|date=15 February 2005|access-date=6 May 2006}}</ref>

Yusuf responded that he was "delighted by the settlement [which] helps vindicate my character and good name.&nbsp;... It seems to be the easiest thing in the world these days to make scurrilous accusations against Muslims and, in my case, it directly impacts on my relief work and damages my reputation as an artist. The harm done is often difficult to repair", and added that he intended to donate the financial award given to him by the court to help orphans of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]].<ref name="libel1"/> He wrote about the experience in a newspaper article entitled "A Cat in a Wild World".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,1317260,00.html|title=A cat in a wild world|work=The Guardian|location=UK|date=1 October 2004|first=Yusuf|last=Islam|access-date=6 May 2006}}</ref>

===Return to music===
====1990s–2006: as Yusuf Islam====
[[File:Yusuf-2009.jpg|thumb|right|Yusuf Islam at the 2009 [[MOJO Awards]] in London]]
Islam gradually resumed his musical career in the 1990s. His initial recordings had not included any musical instruments other than percussion, and they featured lyrics about Islamic themes, some in [[spoken word]] or [[hamd]] form. He invested in building his own recording studio which he named Mountain of Light Studios in the late 1990s, and he was featured as a guest singer on "God Is the Light", a song on an album of [[Anasheed|nasheeds]] by the group [[Raihan]]. In addition, he invited and collaborated with other Muslim singers, including Canadian artist [[Dawud Wharnsby]]. After Islam's friend, [[Irfan Ljubijankić]], the [[Foreign Minister]] of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was killed by a Serbian rocket attack, Islam appeared at a 1997 benefit concert in [[Sarajevo]] and recorded a benefit album named after a song written by Ljubijankić, ''I Have No Cannons That Roar''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yusuf Islam at House of Commons Album Launch|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=43127|date=March 1998|access-date=11 February 2009}}</ref>

Realising there were few educational resources designed to teach children about the Islamic religion, Islam wrote and produced a children's album, ''[[A Is for Allah]]'', in 2000<ref name="globe2000">{{cite news|first=Stephanie|last=Nolen|title=The Cat's Comeback|date=22 May 2000|page=R1|work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/the-cats-comeback/article1039747/|access-date=1 September 2016}}</ref> with the assistance of South African singer-songwriter [[Zain Bhikha]]. The title song was one Islam had written years before to introduce his first child to both the religion and the Arabic alphabet. He also established his own record label, "Jamal Records", and Mountain of Light Productions, and he donates a percentage of his projects' proceeds to his ''[[Small Kindness]]'' charity, whose name is taken from the Qur'an.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.youngmuslims.ca/online_library/tafsir/syed_qutb/surah_107.htm|title=Surah 107:Small Kindness – al Ma'oun|access-date=11 February 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530024229/http://web.youngmuslims.ca/online_library/tafsir/syed_qutb/surah_107.htm|archive-date=30 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

On the occasion of the 2000 re-release of his Cat Stevens albums, at the urging of his label rep Sujata, Islam agreed to interviews with the media to tell his story and reconnect with his fans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/cat-stevens-breaks-his-silence-202844/|title=Cat Stevens Breaks His Silence|first=Andrew|last=Dansby|website=Rollingstone.com|date=21 June 2000|access-date=22 October 2021}}</ref> Islam explained that he had stopped performing in English due to his misunderstanding of the Islamic faith. "This issue of music in Islam is not as cut-and-dried as I was led to believe&nbsp;... I relied on heresy, that was perhaps my mistake."<ref name="globe2000" /><!-- editors: "heresy" is correct--> He also participated in the first documentary on his life for a two-part VH1 ''Behind the Music''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/episodes/xyvdya/behind-the-music-cat-stevens-behind-the-music-130-season-1-ep-130|title=Behind the Music - Cat Stevens: Behind the Music |website=Vh1.com|access-date=22 October 2021}}</ref>

Islam has reflected that his decision to leave the Western pop music business was perhaps too quick with too little communication for his fans. For most it was a surprise, and even his long-time guitarist Alun Davies said in later interviews that he hadn't believed that his friend would actually go through with it after his many forays into other religions throughout their relationship.<ref name="Forbes"/> Islam himself has said the "cut" between his former life and his life as a Muslim might have been too quick, and too severe, and that more people might have been better informed about Islam, and given an opportunity to better understand it, and himself, if he had simply removed those items that were considered ''[[Haraam|harām]]'', in his performances, allowing him to express himself musically and educate listeners through his music without violating any religious constraints.<ref name="Turn to Islam">{{cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2645580672038253877|title=NEW Yusuf Islam Interview and a Is For Allah Peace Train Cat Stevens|last=Islam|first=Yusuf|work=Video of Interview|publisher=Turn to Islam|pages=1–6|access-date=30 July 2008}}</ref>

In 2003, after repeated encouragement from within the Muslim world,<ref name="PRJan05">{{cite press release|publisher=Mountain of Light|date=24 January 2005|title=Yusuf Islam sings for tsunami victims and told to make more music and spread Peace|url=http://www.mountainoflight.co.uk/news_tsunami.html|access-date=6 May 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709200553/http://www.mountainoflight.co.uk/news_tsunami.html|archive-date=9 July 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Islam once again recorded "[[Peace Train]]" for a compilation CD, which also included performances by [[David Bowie]] and Paul McCartney. He performed "[[Wild World (song)|Wild World]]" in [[Nelson Mandela]]'s [[46664 (concerts)|46664 concert]] with his earlier collaborator, [[Peter Gabriel]], the first time he had publicly performed in English in 25 years. In December 2004, he and [[Ronan Keating]] released a new version of "[[Father and Son (song)|Father and Son]]": the song entered the charts at number two, behind [[Band Aid (band)#Band Aid 20|Band Aid 20]]'s  "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]" They also produced a video of the pair walking between photographs of fathers and sons, while singing the song. The proceeds of "Father and Son" were donated to the [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid charity]]. Keating's former group, [[Boyzone]], had a hit with the song a decade earlier. As he had been persuaded before, Islam contributed to the song, because the proceeds were marked for charity.

On 21 April 2005 Islam gave a short talk before a scheduled musical performance in [[Abu Dhabi]], United Arab Emirates, on the anniversary of the prophet [[Muhammad]]'s birthday. He said: <blockquote>There is a great deal of ignorance in the world about Islam today, and we hope to communicate with the help of something more refined than lectures and talks. Our recordings are particularly appealing to the young, having used songs as well as Qur'an verses with pleasing sound effects&nbsp;...<ref name="Islamic Voice">{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicvoice.com/march.2001/news.htm|title=New Recordings by Yusuf Islam|date=March 2001|access-date=11 February 2009|archive-date=16 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716122600/http://www.islamicvoice.com/march.2001/news.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref></blockquote>

Islam observed that there are no real guidelines about instruments and no references about the business of music in the Qur'an, and that [[Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe|Muslim travellers first brought]] the guitar to [[Moorish Spain]]. He noted that Muhammad was fond of celebrations, as in the case of the birth of a child, or a traveller arriving after a long journey. Thus, Islam concluded that healthy entertainment was acceptable within limitations, and that he now felt that it was no sin to perform with the guitar.  Music, he now felt, is uplifting to the soul; something sorely needed in troubled times.<ref name="Emirates">{{cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1897010327804155638&q=&hl=en|title=Yusuf Islam in Abu Dhabi|last=Islam|first=Yusuf|date=22 May 2005 |publisher=Emirates TV |access-date=31 July 2008}}</ref> At that point, he was joined by several young male singers who sang backing vocals and played a drum, with Islam as lead singer and guitarist. They performed two songs, both half in Arabic and half in English; "[[Ta'la al Badru 'Alayna|Tala'a Al-Badru Alayna]]", an old song in Arabic which Islam recorded with a folk sound to it, and another song, "The Wind East and West", which was newly written by Islam and featured a distinct [[R&B]] sound.

With this performance, Islam began slowly to integrate instruments into both older material from his Cat Stevens era (some with slight lyrical changes) and new songs, both those known to the Muslim communities around the world and some that have the same Western flair from before with a focus on new topics and another generation of listeners.<ref name="Turn to Islam" />

In a 2005 press release, he explained his revived recording career:
{{quote|After I embraced Islam, many people told me to carry on composing and recording, but at the time I was hesitant, for fear that it might be for the wrong reasons. I felt unsure what the right course of action was. I guess it is only now, after all these years, that I've come to fully understand and appreciate what everyone has been asking of me. It's as if I've come full circle; however, I have gathered a lot of knowledge on the subject in the meantime.<ref name="PRJan05" />}}

{{Quote box|width=30em|align=right|quote="In Islam there is something called the principle of common good. What that means is that whenever one is confronted by something that is not mentioned in the scriptures, one must observe what benefit it can bring.

If the scholars see that it is something positive, they may well approve of what I'm doing."|source=—Yusuf Islam<ref name="ARABIA">{{cite web|url=https://en.qantara.de/content/interview-with-yusuf-islam-to-be-you-must-give-up-what-you-are|title="To Be, You Must Give up What You Are" – Interview with Yusuf Islam (2006) |last=Mingels|first=Guido|date=21 May 2008 |publisher=ARABIA.pl (reprinted Qantara.de) |access-date=15 October 2015}}</ref>}}

In early 2005, Islam released a new song, entitled "Indian Ocean", about the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami disaster. The song featured Indian composer/producer [[A. R. Rahman]], [[a-ha]] keyboard player [[Magne Furuholmen]] and [[Travis (band)|Travis]] drummer [[Neil Primrose (musician)|Neil Primrose]]. Proceeds of the single went to help orphans in [[Banda Aceh]], one of the areas worst affected by the [[tsunami]], through Islam's ''Small Kindness'' charity. At first, the single was released only through several [[online music store]]s but later featured on the compilation album ''[[Gold (Cat Stevens album)|Cat Stevens: Gold]]''.

On 28 May 2005, Islam delivered a [[keynote speech]] and performed at the [[Adopt-A-Minefield]] Gala in [[Düsseldorf]]. The Adopt-A-Minefield charity, under the patronage of Paul McCartney, works internationally to raise awareness and funds to clear landmines and rehabilitate [[landmine]] survivors. Islam attended as part of an honorary committee which also included [[George Martin]], [[Richard Branson]], [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]], [[Klaus Voormann]], [[Christopher Lee]] and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yusufislam.org.uk/ |title=Yusuf Islam Official website |publisher=Yusufislam.org.uk |access-date=27 July 2009}}</ref>

In [[2005 in music|mid-2005]], Islam played guitar for the Dolly Parton album ''[[Those Were the Days (Dolly Parton album)|Those Were the Days]]'' on her version of his "Where Do the Children Play?" (Parton had also covered "Peace Train" a few years earlier.)

Islam has credited his then 21-year-old son Muhammad Islam, also a musician and artist, for his return to secular music, when the son brought a guitar back into the house, which Islam began playing.<ref name="CBSSundaymorning"/> Muhammad's professional name is [[Yoriyos]]<ref name="past present" /> and his debut album was released in February 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yoriyos.com |title=Official website for Yoriyos |publisher=Yoriyos.com |access-date=27 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415173644/http://www.yoriyos.com/ |archive-date=15 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/altmuslim/2006/11/so_mr_islam_has_a_new_album_out/|title=Musician Yoriyos: So, Mr. Islam has a new album out…|date=15 November 2006|work=[[Patheos]]|access-date=23 November 2016}}</ref> Yoriyos created the art on Islam's album ''[[An Other Cup]]'', something that Cat Stevens did for his own albums in the 1970s.

In May 2006, in anticipation of his forthcoming new pop album, the BBC1 programme ''[[Imagine (TV series)|Imagine]]'' aired a 49-minute documentary with [[Alan Yentob]] called ''Yusuf: The Artist formerly Known as Cat Stevens''. This documentary film features rare audio and video clips from the late 1960s and 1970s, as well as an extensive interview with Islam, his brother David Gordon, several record executives, [[Bob Geldof]], [[Dolly Parton]], and others outlining his career as Cat Stevens, his conversion and emergence as Yusuf Islam, and his return to music in 2006. There are clips of him singing in the studio when he was recording ''An Other Cup'' as well as a few 2006 excerpts of him on guitar singing a few verses of Cat Stevens songs including "The Wind" and "On the Road to Find Out".<ref name="Yentob"/>

In December 2006, Islam was one of the artists who performed at the [[Nobel Peace Prize Concert]] in Oslo, Norway, in honour of the prize winners, [[Muhammad Yunus]] and [[Grameen Bank]]. He performed the songs "Midday (Avoid City After Dark)", "Peace Train", and "Heaven/Where True Love Goes". He also gave a concert in New York City that month as a ''[[Jazz at Lincoln Center]]'' event, recorded and broadcast by [[KCRW|KCRW-FM]] radio, along with an interview by [[Nic Harcourt]]. Accompanying him, as in the Cat Stevens days, was [[Alun Davies (guitarist)|Alun Davies]], on guitar and vocals.

====2006–2017: as Yusuf====
=====2006–2008: ''An Other Cup'' and appearances=====
In March 2006, Islam finished recording his first all-new pop album since 1978.<ref name="billboard1">{{cite magazine|url=http://billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002199215|title=A cat in a wild world|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard.com]]|date=17 March 2006|first=Melinda|last=Newman|access-date=9 June 2006}}</ref> The album, ''[[An Other Cup]]'', was released internationally in November 2006 on his own label, Ya Records (distributed by [[Polydor Records]] in the UK, and internationally by [[Atlantic Records]])—the 40th anniversary of his first album, ''[[Matthew and Son (album)|Matthew and Son]]''. An accompanying single, called "Heaven/Where True Love Goes", was also released. The album was produced with [[Rick Nowels]], who has worked with [[Dido (singer)|Dido]] and [[Rod Stewart]]. The performer is noted as "Yusuf", with a cover label identifying him as "the artist formerly known as Cat Stevens". The art on the album is credited to Yoriyos. Islam wrote all of the songs except "[[Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood]]",<ref>written by [[Bennie Benjamin]], Gloria Caldwell and Sol Marcus; discussed by Islam in a [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928154157/http://www2.capitalgold.com/staticweb/avplayers/vanilla/gold_audio.html?&stream=mms%3A%2F%2Fstream2.capitalinteractive.co.uk%2Fgold%2Faudio%2Fdavid_jensen_-_yusuf4.wma&end November 2006 interview]</ref> and recorded it in the United States and the United Kingdom.<ref name="billboard1" />

Islam actively promoted this album, appearing on radio, television and in print interviews. In November 2006, he told the BBC, "It's me, so it's going to sound like that of course&nbsp;... This is the real thing&nbsp;... When my son brought the guitar back into the house, you know, that was the turning point. It opened a flood of, of new ideas and music which I think a lot of people would connect with."<ref>{{Cite news |title=Yusuf Islam to Release New Album |url=http://www.onislam.net/english/news/3341/448258.html |quote=Quoted in Agence France-Presse article. |date=1 October 2006 |access-date=27 June 2014}}</ref> Originally, he began to return only to his acoustic guitar as he had in the past, but his son encouraged him to "experiment", which resulted in the purchase of a [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] [[Fender Stratocaster]]<ref name="Reuters2007">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSN1945933420071020|title=Folk artist Yusuf Islam to sing about deportation|first=Dean|last=Goodman|work=Reuters|date=20 October 2007|access-date=6 December 2007}}</ref> in 2007.

Also in November 2006, ''Billboard'' magazine was curious as to why the artist is credited as just his first name, "Yusuf" rather than "Yusuf Islam".<ref name="Musical Return"/> His response was "Because 'Islam' doesn't have to be [[slogan]]ised. The second name is like the official tag, but you call a friend by their first name. It's more intimate, and to me that's the message of this record." As for why the album sleeve says "the artist formerly known as Cat Stevens", he responded, "That's the tag with which most people are familiar; for recognition purposes I'm not averse to that. For a lot of people, it reminds them of something they want to hold on to. That name is part of my history and a lot of the things I dreamt about as Cat Stevens have come true as Yusuf Islam."<ref name="Musical Return" />

Islam was asked by the Swiss [[periodical publication|periodical]] ''[[Tages-Anzeiger|Das Magazin]]'' why the title of the album was ''An Other Cup'', rather than "Another Cup". The answer was that his breakthrough album, ''Tea for the Tillerman'' in 1970, was decorated with Islam's painting of a peasant sitting down to a cup of steaming drink on the land. He commented that the two worlds "then, and now, are very different". His new album shows a steaming cup alone on this cover. His answer was that this was actually an ''other'' cup; something different; a bridge between the East and West, which he explained was his own perceived role. He added that, through him, "Westerners might get a glimpse of the East, and Easterners, some understanding of the West. The cup, too, is important; it's a meeting place, a thing meant to be shared."<ref name="ARABIA"/>

On ''CBS Sunday Morning'' in December 2006, he said, "You know, the cup is there to be filled&nbsp;... with whatever you want to fill it with. For those people looking for Cat Stevens, they'll probably find him in this record. If you want to find [Yusuf] Islam, go a bit deeper, you'll find him."<ref name="CBSSundaymorning"/> He has since described the album as being "over-produced" and refers to ''An Other Cup'' as being a necessary hurdle he had to overcome before he could release his new album, ''Roadsinger''.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In April 2007, BBC1 broadcast a concert given at the [[Porchester Hall]] by Islam as part of ''BBC Sessions'', his first live performance in London in 28 years (the previous one being the [[UNICEF]] "Year of the Child" concert in 1979). He played several new songs along with some old ones like "Father and Son", "The Wind", "Where Do the Children Play?", "Don't Be Shy", "Wild World", and "Peace Train".<ref>{{cite web|title=BBC Four Sessions: Yusuf Islam|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007d8r4|website=BBC Four|publisher=BBC|access-date=23 January 2017}}</ref>

In July 2007, he performed at a concert in [[Bochum]], Germany, in benefit of Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]]'s Peace Centre in South Africa and the Milagro Foundation of Deborah and [[Carlos Santana]]. The audience included Nobel Laureates [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], Desmond Tutu and other prominent global figures. He later appeared as the final act in the [[Live Earth concert, Hamburg|German leg]] of [[Live Earth]] in Hamburg performing some classic Cat Stevens songs and more recent compositions reflecting his concern for peace and child welfare. His set included [[Stevie Wonder]]'s "Saturn", "Peace Train", "Where Do the Children Play?", "Ruins", and "Wild World". He performed at the [[Peace One Day]] concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] on 21 September 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://musicnews.virginmedia.com/news/?news_id=29437 |title=All-star line up for Peace One Day |publisher=Musicnews.virginmedia.com |access-date=27 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014012210/http://musicnews.virginmedia.com/news/?news_id=29437 |archive-date=14 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
