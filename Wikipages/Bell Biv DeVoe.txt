'''Bell Biv DeVoe''', also known as '''BBD''', is an American music group from Boston, Massachusetts, formed from members of [[New Edition]], consisting of [[Ricky Bell (singer)|Ricky Bell]], [[Michael Bivins]], and [[Ronnie DeVoe]].

The band is best known for their debut album, the multi-platinum selling ''[[Poison (Bell Biv DeVoe album)|Poison]]'', a key work in the [[new jack swing]] movement of the 1990s that combined elements of traditional [[soul music|soul]] and [[R&B music|R&B]] with [[hip hop music|hip hop]].  Two singles from the album, "[[Poison (Bell Biv DeVoe song)|Poison]]" and "[[Do Me!]]," both reached number 3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in 1990.  The band released three more albums, though none had the success of their debut. Their most recent album ''[[Three Stripes (album)|Three Stripes]]'' came out in 2017.

Despite only producing four albums of original material in a 31-year span, the group has continuously toured and performed live, both as an act on their own and on several New Edition reunion tours.

==History==
The trio of [[Ricky Bell (singer)|Ricky Bell]], [[Michael Bivins]], and [[Ronnie DeVoe]] has their origins as founders of the [[Boston]]-based quintet [[New Edition]], which had gained notice of famed producer [[Maurice Starr]] at a talent show in 1981, and as children had several hits with songs like "[[Candy Girl (New Edition song)|Candy Girl]]" and "[[Cool It Now]]". 

Throughout the 1980s, the line-up changed and the group matured and sought to branch out in new musical directions.  During a hiatus in 1989, and at the suggestion of producers [[Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis]], the three decided to form a new group, and were signed by [[MCA Records]].<ref name="popdose">Heyliger, Mike. "Popdose Flashback ’90: Bell Biv DeVoe, Poison" (Popdose.com.  March 11, 2010. Web. March 25, 2010.)</ref> With help from [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] producers [[Eric Sadler]], [[Hank Shocklee|Hank]] and [[Keith Shocklee]] and several others, Bell Biv Devoe released its debut album ''Poison'' in 1990, an album credited as pioneering the "[[new jack swing]]" sound of the early 1990s, combining hip-hop, funk, soul, and pop music.<ref>J. D. Considine. "After a great 1990, Bell Biv DeVoe to ring in new year: [FINAL Edition]". December 28, 1990, ''Baltimore Sun''.

Shortly thereafter, [[Richard Wolf]] and [[Epic Mazur]] were responsible for the remix of "Do Me!" (which hit number six on the dance charts).<ref>{{cite news|last=Widran|first=Jonathan|title=Producer Crosstalk|newspaper=Music Connection|date=April 14, 1991}}</ref> ''Poison'' also spawned the singles  "[[B.B.D.

[[Richard Wolf]] and [[Epic Mazur]] helped create BBD's premiere album, blending rhythm, blues, pop, and rock, and Poison achieve triple [[Music recording sales certification#Certification thresholds|Platinum]] success.<ref>{{cite news|last=Savona|first=Anthony|title=Hot Picks|newspaper=EQ|date=June 1991}}</ref>

Bell Biv DeVoe released ''[[Hootie Mack]]'' in 1993 on MCA Records, and the more hardcore rap/R&B influenced ''[[BBD (album)|BBD]]'' in 2001 on [[Biv 10 Records]]. Neither album was as successful as ''Poison'', though ''Hootie Mack'' did reach Gold success. Despite the fact that the group has only released four albums, the members of Bell Biv Devoe continue to perform together as a group.<ref>Gerald M. Gay.  {{"'}}80s group still has its devotees: Bell Biv DeVoe here for 'Slow Jams Live' gig." McClatchy – Tribune Business News  19 February 2009  ProQuest Newsstand, ProQuest. Web.

On May 30, 2013, Bell Biv DeVoe performed their hit song "Poison" for [[Boston Strong]], a benefit concert to raise money for victims of the [[Boston Marathon bombing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classichitsandoldies.com/v2/2013/05/31/aerosmith-james-taylor-boston-nkotb-and-others-perform-at-boston-strong-benefit-concert/ |title=Aerosmith, James Taylor, Boston, NKOTB and Others Perform at Boston Strong Benefit Concert |publisher=Classichitsandoldies.com |date=2013-05-28 |access-date=2013-06-01}}</ref>

Bell Biv DeVoe was among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=June 28, 2019 |date=June 25, 2019}}</ref>

==Awards and nominations==
