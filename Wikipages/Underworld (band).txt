'''Underworld''' are a British [[electronic music]] group formed in 1987 in [[Cardiff]], Wales<ref>"[https://web.archive.org/web/20090310183206/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/underworld-reborn-slippy-424956.html Underworld: Reborn slippy]", ''[[The Independent]]'', 19 November 2006, Retrieved on 24 January 2014</ref> and the principal name of [[Karl Hyde]] and [[Rick Smith (musician)|Rick Smith]] recording together. Prominent former members include [[Darren Emerson]], from 1991 to 2001, and Darren Price, as part of the live band from 2005 to 2016.

After briefly performing as a [[funk]] and [[synth-pop]] outfit, resulting in two albums between 1988 and 1989, Underworld gained prominence after reshaping into a [[trance music|trance]] and [[techno]] band, releasing albums including ''[[Dubnobasswithmyheadman]]'' (1994), ''[[Second Toughest in the Infants]]'' (1996) and ''[[Beaucoup Fish]]'' (1998), as well as singles  "[[Born Slippy .NUXX]]" and "[[Dark & Long|Dark & Long (Dark Train)]]". Known for their atmospheric, [[progressive house|progressive]] compositions, Hyde's cryptic lyrics, and dynamic live performances, Underworld have influenced a wide range of artists and have been featured in soundtracks and scores for films, television, and the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London.

== History ==
=== The Screen Gemz, Freur, and Underworld Mk1 ===
In the late 1970s, Karl Hyde and Rick Smith formed a band in [[Cardiff]] called the Screen Gemz, which was influenced by [[Kraftwerk]] and [[reggae]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hugh|first1=Montgomery|title=How We Met: Rick Smith & Karl Hyde|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/how-we-met-rick-smith-amp-karl-hyde-2130458.html|website=[[The Independent]]|access-date=9 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Dorian|first1=Lynskey|title=Underworld's Dubnobass ... 20 years on|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/09/karl-hyde-rick-smith-underworld-1994-album-dubnobasswithmyheadman|website=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=9 October 2017}}</ref> They were joined by bassist Alfie Thomas, drummer Bryn Burrows, and keyboardist John Warwicker in forming [[Freur]]. The band signed to [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] and released ''[[Doot-Doot]]'' (1983). They disbanded in 1986 after followup ''[[Get Us Out of Here]]'' was withheld.<ref>{{cite web|title=Freur|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/freur-mn0000987643/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=9 October 2017}}</ref>

In 1987, Hyde, Smith, Thomas, Burrows and bassist Baz Allen formed Underworld, named after the 1985 horror film ''[[Underworld (1985 film)|Underworld]],'' which was scored by Freur.<ref name=":0">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/09/karl-hyde-rick-smith-underworld-1994-album-dubnobasswithmyheadman |title=Underworld's Dubnobass ... 20 years on |last1=Lynskey |first1=Dorian |date=9 October 2014 |website=[[Theguardian.com]]|access-date=9 October 2014}}</ref> Underworld signed to [[Sire Records]] and released the album ''[[Underneath the Radar]]'' in 1988. Following the departure of Burrows, they released another album, ''[[Change the Weather]],'' in 1989. This lineup, referred to by the group as "Underworld Mk1", disbanded in 1990.<ref name=":0" />

=== Emerson's arrival and Underworld Mk2 ===
{{Listen

|description=The band's 1993 dance anthem, "[[Rez (song)|Rez]]".
|format=[[Ogg]]}}
After a break—to concentrate on, among other things, art/design project [[Tomato (design collective)|Tomato]]—Hyde and Smith recruited DJ [[Darren Emerson]] and signed to Steven Hall's Junior Boys Own label. After several releases and remixes as Lemon Inter<!--This is the intentional spelling of the band name with one 'r'-->upt and Steppin' Razor readopted the Underworld moniker. They produced danceable [[techno]] as a trio ("Underworld Mk2").

The addition of Emerson completed Underworld's techno/rock fusion and seemed to eliminate the pop elements in the original duo's work. Their first album, ''[[Dubnobasswithmyheadman]]'', was considered more accessible than the group's earlier material and crossed a large spectrum of dance music. The signature Hyde lyrics were in place: poetic, hypnotic and whispered; mixing conventional song writing with the use of [[Found art|found material]] from overheard conversations, answering machine recordings and the like. Hyde had been the lead singer in Underworld Mk1 but the original Hyde/Smith dance material was lyric-free as was most of the electronic music emerging from the aftermath of [[acid house]].

===''Trainspotting'' and breakthrough ===
The band's 1996 album, ''[[Second Toughest in the Infants]]'', was their second studio album with Emerson and achieved a degree of commercial success, due in part to its release coinciding with that of the film ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''. The film featured "Dark & Long (Dark Train)", as well as the band's most commercially successful track to date, "[[Born Slippy.NUXX]]", which was originally released only as a B-side of a single and does not appear on the ''Second Toughest'' album. The single and the album showed Underworld maturing as a trio, mixing elements of [[techno]], [[House music|house]], [[drum and bass]] and [[experimental music]]. "Born Slippy.NUXX" is one of Underworld's best-known tracks and is celebrated as one of the greatest dance tracks of the decade. The track has since sold over a million copies and appeared on countless [[Compilation album|compilations]], [[Mashup (music)|mashups]] and [[remix]]es.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

=== ''Beaucoup Fish'' era ===
After the release of fifth studio album ''[[Beaucoup Fish]]'' in 1999, Hyde declared in his interviews that he had sorted out earlier problems with [[alcoholism]] but all the members admitted that the sessions had been fraught with problems, with the individual members working in their own studios and only communicating via mixes of the raw material passed back and forth on [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]]. After the release of the album a large number of mixes of the album tracks seemed to surface on singles, magazine promotional CDs and similar ephemeral formats perhaps indicating the number of revisions the tracks had gone through to get to the point where they were acceptable to all three. The album's name derives from a sample of a Cajun fisherman in Louisiana on the track "[[Jumbo (Underworld song)|Jumbo]]". The band originally wanted to call the album ''Tonight, Matthew, I'm going to be Underworld'' (a catchphrase used by contestants on the UK [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] programme [[Stars in Their Eyes]]) but were convinced by their record company, [[Junior Boy's Own]], that the name would not be easily understood outside the UK. Finally, after all the singles had been released, a box set, ''[[Beaucoup Fish Singles]]'', which was a retrospective of all 4 singles came out.

Underworld embarked on a well-received tour in 1999, which resulted in a live CD and DVD drawn from several dates on the tour. Called ''[[Everything, Everything (album)|Everything, Everything]]'', the project captured the live Underworld experience very faithfully. A companion DVD was released separately soon after the album's release. The DVD features live footage of the band mixed with videography and artistic effects by the design group [[Tomato (design collective)|Tomato]]. The DVD also features several songs not on the album: "Moaner", "Puppies", "Kittens" and "Rowla". The disco scene in ''[[Vanilla Sky]]'' features Underworld's 1993 hit "[[Rez (song)|Rez]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259711/soundtrack|title=Vanilla Sky (2001) |website=IMDb.com}}</ref>

=== Emerson's departure and back to a duo ===
After the release and promotion of ''Everything, Everything'', Emerson decided to leave Underworld to focus on his solo projects and record label. Hyde and Smith decided to continue as a duo. They recorded a new album, ''[[A Hundred Days Off]]'', released to general approval. Despite its status as the band's first studio album since Emerson's departure, its general sound and feel was, perhaps surprisingly for many Underworld fans, not dissimilar to the previous albums on which Emerson had had input. In 2003, a 2-disc anthology entitled ''1992–2002'' was released. This was the first appearance on an album of previously unavailable single tracks and B-sides, such as "Bigmouth", "[[Spikee]]", "Dirty" and "8 Ball". While touring in the summer and autumn of 2005, the duo was joined on stage by Darren Price, a DJ and producer who had remixed Underworld releases in the past.

During their tour, they released a 3-CD set ''[[Live in Tokyo 25th November 2005|Live in Tokyo]]'', which was sold after the concert in Japan and later sold online. In late 2005, they released two compilations of new songs with accompanying photographs on Underworld Live, in a series entitled ''[[Riverrun (Underworld project)|Riverrun]]''. These were only released online, with no physical release (except for a promo CD). On 5 June 2006, they released their third installment, and on 10 July 2006, they released ''The Misterons Mix'', a special retrospective mix composed of ''Riverrun'' tracks, as an exclusive free download for customers that had purchased all three ''Riverrun'' releases.

In September 2006, Underworld released five limited edition (10,000 copies each) [[12"]] vinyl releases, containing remixes of various ''Riverrun'' tracks. These tracks were also made available for purchase by digital download on the [[Beatport]] website. Later in 2006, the band teamed up with [[Gabriel Yared]] to compose the music score to [[Anthony Minghella]]'s film ''[[Breaking and Entering (film)|Breaking and Entering]]''. [[Breaking and Entering (soundtrack)|The soundtrack]] was released in the UK on 6 November, and in the USA on 5 December.

=== ''Oblivion with Bells''===
[[File:Underworldlivenewyork2007 crop.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Underworld performing "[[Jumbo (Underworld song)|Jumbo]]" in [[Central Park]], [[New York City]], 2007.]]
Underworld's seventh studio album, ''[[Oblivion with Bells]]'', was released on 16 October 2007. The first single from the new album, "[[Crocodile (song)|Crocodile]]", was released on 5 September 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trafficjpn.com/news/show/52|title=The information of Underworld and new work sale.

The soundtrack is a collaboration with composer [[John Murphy (composer)|John Murphy]].<ref>[http://www.darktrain.org/dirty/forums/showpost.php?p=58215&postcount=14] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306160450/http://www.darktrain.org/dirty/forums/showpost.php?p=58215&postcount=14 |date=6 March 2016 }}</ref>

On 16 June 2007, Underworld were forced to cancel their show at the Ejekt Festival in Athens, Greece. Approximately 30 masked Greek anarchists stormed the stadium while the [[Beastie Boys]] were performing. Rick Smith was one of the people injured in the ensuing violence and he was taken to a nearby Athens hospital for treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pr-inside.com/underworld-dj-injured-in-riot-r157510.htm|title=UNDERWORLD DJ INJURED IN RIOT|access-date=31 August 2010}}</ref> On 19 October 2007, Underworld cancelled the remaining dates of their European tour due to illness in the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=26653_0_2_0_C|title=Underworld cancel tour after severe illness member|access-date=24 October 2007}}</ref> The tour was picked up again on 28 January 2008, with a concert in Cologne, followed by 16 dates in Europe, including some festivals.

On 8 August 2008, Underworld appeared at the [[All Points West Music & Arts Festival]] in [[Liberty State Park]], New Jersey. Karl Hyde appeared with [[Brian Eno]] on the final day of the Eno-curated Luminous Festival at Sydney Opera House. "Pure Scenius" consisted of three live improvised performances on the same day, featuring Eno, Hyde, Australian improv trio [[the Necks]], electronic artist [[Jon Hopkins]] and guitarist [[Leo Abrahams]].

Underworld has released two new series via their underworldlive.com site, in mp3 and WAV formats. The tracks are 020202, and the phonestrap/autotrader series. On 3 July 2009, Underworld debuted a new song tentatively titled "Between Stars" at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. Shortly before that, a post was made on the band's diary page showing a piece of paper with the song's first verse on it. On 8 August 2009, a show at Los Angeles' Forum was cancelled in circumstances similar to those that led to the group cancelling the show in Athens two years prior. Some of the crowd were climbing down the seats and onto the main floor, a potential safety hazard. The group apologized on their website for having the show called off.

On 8 March 2010 [[Mark Knight (musician)|Mark Knight]] and [[D. Ramirez]] released the single "Downpipe", which featured vocal contributions from Underworld's Karl Hyde. The song, released on Mark Knight's Toolroom Records label, has a music video featuring the "Playhouse", a lighting setup on Liberty Hall, the tallest building in [[Dublin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbghaUtVfJg| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211118/NbghaUtVfJg| archive-date=2021-11-18 | url-status=live|title=Downpipe music video|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=24 October 2007}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

===''Barking''===
On 13 May 2010, the band released a track called "Scribble" for download on the band's site. The track shares elements with "[[Live in Tokyo 25th November 2005|You Do Scribble]]", an unreleased song which they featured many times since 2005 in their live performance shows. The track is a collaboration with [[High Contrast]], a [[drum and bass]] [[DJ]] also from Cardiff. On 14 May, the full version of "Scribble" was featured on [[Pete Tong]]'s [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] radio show, declaring it as [[Essential Selection|Essential New Tune]] of the week.<ref>{{cite web|title=BBC Radio 1 – Pete Tong |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006ww0v |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822183839/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006ww0v |archive-date=22 August 2015 }}</ref> The group also released a video clip for "Scribble" on [[YouTube]]. It has been commercially released on 28 June as the lead single from their latest album.

On 7 June 2010, Underworld announced the details of their eighth studio album, ''[[Barking (album)|Barking]]'', which was released on 13 September 2010 in the UK.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Underworld announce new album tracklisting and release date |url=https://www.nme.com/news/underworld/51363|date=7 June 2010|magazine=[[NME]]|access-date=9 June 2010}}</ref> The album features collaborations with German [[trance music|trance]] producer [[Paul van Dyk]] and British house artists Mark Knight and D.

On 25 August 2010, Rick Smith released a limited edition solo album ''Bungalow With Stairs 1'', music to accompany "What's Going on in Your Head When You're Dancing" an exhibition of paintings by Karl Hyde at the Laforet Museum, Harajuku, Tokyo during 2010. The album was available from the band's website and was packaged with the exhibition catalogue. In December 2010 it was announced that Underworld would reunite with ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'' director Danny Boyle to write the musical score for his production of [[Frankenstein (2011 play)|Frankenstein]] at the [[Royal National Theatre]]. The production was broadcast as a part of [[National Theatre Live]] on 17 March 2011, with a soundtrack release on Underworld's website in March 2011. In February 2011 Underworld confirmed that they would play a huge London summer show on Saturday 27 August on Clapham Common as headliners of South West Four.

=== ''Anthology,'' the Olympics and solo projects ===
In November 2011, Underworld announced two new compilations, ''A Collection'' and ''1992–2012 Anthology''. ''A Collection'' features many of the band's biggest tracks alongside recent collaborations with High Contrast featuring [[Tiësto]] & Underworld ("The First Note Is Silent"), Mark Knight & D. Ramirez ("Downpipe") and [[Brian Eno]] ("Beebop Hurry"). ''1992–2012 Anthology'' is a 3-disc set and is a refreshed and revisited version of ''1992–2002'' with more material, unreleased tracks and rarities to go some way to completing the picture of the first two decades of Underworld.

In December 2011, Underworld were chosen to direct the music for the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], reprising their partnership with filmmaker and ceremony director [[Danny Boyle]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hanna |first=Laurie |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/music/2011/12/07/underworld-to-create-london-2012-opening-ceremony-music-115875-23616597/ |title=Underworld to create London 2012 opening ceremony music – Mirror Online |website=Mirror.co.uk |date=7 December 2011 |access-date=24 April 2014}}</ref> The band also contributed two original tracks for the opening ceremony: "[[And I Will Kiss]]" (featuring [[Evelyn Glennie|Dame Evelyn Glennie]] with the Pandemonium Drummers) and "[[Caliban's Dream]]" in collaboration with the Dockhead Choir, [[Evelyn Glennie|Dame Evelyn Glennie]], [[Only Men Aloud]], Elizabeth Roberts, Esme Smith (band member Rick Smith's daughter<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dunmowbroadcast.co.uk/news/felsted_student_in_gig_of_her_life_at_london_2012_opening_ceremony_1_1469350 |title=Felsted student in gig of her life at London 2012 opening ceremony – News |publisher=Dunmow Broadcast |access-date=24 April 2014}}</ref>) and [[Alex Trimble]]. Underworld contributed 11 of the 36 tracks on the soundtrack, ''[[Isles of Wonder: Music for the Opening Ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games|Isles of Wonder]]''. For their work on the Olympics, Underworld won the 2012 [[Q Awards#2012|Q Award]] for Innovation in Sound.

On 22 April 2013, Karl Hyde released his debut solo album ''[[Edgeland (album)|Edgeland]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bass |first=George |url=http://drownedinsound.com/releases/17616/reviews/4146354/ |title=Album Review: Karl Hyde – Edgeland / Releases / Releases // Drowned In Sound |website=Drownedinsound.com |date=29 April 2013 |access-date=24 April 2014 |archive-date=3 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203153043/http://drownedinsound.com/releases/17616/reviews/4146354 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2014, he went on to release two collaborative albums with [[Brian Eno]] titled ''[[Someday World]]'' on 5 May and ''[[High Life (Eno and Hyde album)|High Life]]'' on 30 June.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.underworldlive.com/news/2014/02/eno-%C2%B7-hyde-new-album-someday-world/|title=ENO · HYDE – New Album "Someday World"|website=Underworldlive.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.underworldlive.com/news/2014/05/eno-%C2%B7-hyde-new-album-high-life/|title=ENO · HYDE – New Album "High Life"|website=Underworldlive.com}}</ref> Rick Smith went on to do some solo work, with two of his musical works being for projects by frequent collaborator director [[Danny Boyle]].

=== Reissues and ''Barbara Barbara, We Face a Shining Future'' ===
In 2014, the group announced their intention to release remastered and expanded editions of all of their studio albums "in the next few years". An expanded edition of ''Dubnobasswithmyheadman'' was released on 6 October 2014 and the group toured in support of the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.underworldlive.com/news/2014/06/dubnobasswithmyheadman-20th-anniversary-re-issue-show-2/ |title=Dubnobasswithmyheadman: 20th anniversary re-issue & show - underworldlive.com |access-date=7 October 2014}}</ref> An expanded edition of ''Second Toughest in the Infants'' was released on 20 November 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title = Second Toughest In The Infants Out Now! {{!}} Underworld Live|url = http://www.underworldlive.com/news/2015/11/second-toughest-in-the-infants-out-now/|website = www.underworldlive.com|access-date = 22 November 2015|archive-date = 23 November 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151123034115/http://www.underworldlive.com/news/2015/11/second-toughest-in-the-infants-out-now/|url-status = dead}}</ref> Just four days after the re-release of ''Second Toughest'', on 24 November, Underworld announced a new album (their first studio album in six years) titled ''[[Barbara Barbara, We Face a Shining Future]]'', released on 18 March 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.underworldlive.com/news/2015/11/shiningfuture/|title=Barbara Barbara, we face a shining future|website=Underworldlive.com|access-date=29 November 2015|archive-date=24 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124142134/http://www.underworldlive.com/news/2015/11/shiningfuture/|url-status=dead}}</ref> The album earned a 2017 [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Album|Best Dance/Electronic Album]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/grammys/7603834/grammy-nominations-2017-dance-electronic|title=The Chainsmokers & Flume Represent for Dance Music at 2017 Grammys, DJ Snake Snubbed Once Again|website=Billboard.com}}</ref> They embarked on a brief European tour in support of the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/11/underworld-announce-new-album-barbara-barbara-we-face-a-shining-future/|title=Underworld announce new album, Barbara Barbara, we face a shining future|work=Consequence of Sound}}</ref> The tour was later expanded to include the United States, Japan and Australia. In 2017, joining once again with frequent collaborator Danny Boyle, Smith wrote the musical score and produced the soundtrack for ''[[T2 Trainspotting]]''. On 25 August 2017, they released an expanded, remastered edition of ''Beaucoup Fish''.

=== The World of Underworld and ''Drift''===
On 21 May 2018, Underworld announced a new project called the World of Underworld.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://underworldlive.com/news/2018/05/05/world-of-underworld/|title=World of Underworld|date=5 May 2018|website=Underworldlive.com}}</ref> Part of the project involves reflecting on and sometimes reimagining their nearly 30 year body of work. But it also serves as an outlet for experimentation, new releases, and spontaneous creativity.
