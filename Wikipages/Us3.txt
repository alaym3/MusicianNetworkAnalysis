'''Us3''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[jazz-rap]] group founded in London in 1992. Their name was inspired by a [[Horace Parlan]] album, titled ''[[Us Three]]'', produced by [[Alfred Lion]], the founder of [[Blue Note Records]].<ref>[[Hand on the Torch]] booklet remark by Bruce Lundvall, President of Blue Note Records</ref> On their debut album, ''[[Hand on the Torch]]'', Us3 exclusively used samples from the [[Blue Note Records]] catalogue, all originally produced by Lion.

==History==
Us3 is the brainchild of London-based producer Geoff Wilkinson.<ref name="LarkinDM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Dance Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1998|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0252-6|page=357}}</ref> Formed in 1992 alongside production partner Mel Simpson, Us3 had two previous incarnations.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> The first, a limited edition [[white label]] 12" release in 1990 called "Where Will We Be in the 21st Century". The release garnered the attention of independent label [[Ninja Tune]], resulting in NW1's 1991 12" "The Band Played The Boogie", featuring UK rapper Born 2 B.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> It sampled a dancefloor tune of the burgeoning jazz dance scene, [[Grant Green]]'s "Sookie Sookie", originally released on [[Blue Note Records]].

London's [[Kiss 100 London|Kiss FM]] added "The Band Played The Boogie" to its playlist and Wilkinson then received a call summoning him to [[EMI]] Records's offices in London.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Wilkinson avoided a lawsuit and was granted rights to the archives of Blue Note Records.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> One of the resulting demos, recorded in March 1992, was "[[Cantaloop (Flip Fantasia)]]", featuring UK trumpeter [[Gerard Presencer]].<ref name="LarkinDM"/> It sampled [[Herbie Hancock]]'s "[[Cantaloupe Island]]".<ref name="LarkinDM"/> Two years later, it entered the US top ten and was included on ''Hand on the Torch'', the first Blue Note album to achieve platinum status (1,000,000 sales) in the US.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

After several world tours with Us3, Mel Simpson left the group for other endeavours. Wilkinson initiated work on a second album in 1996, marshalling New York rappers KCB and [[Shabaam Sahdeeq]] to replace Rahsaan Kelly, Kobie Powell, and Tukka Yoot for the 1997 release ''[[Broadway & 52nd]]''.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> The Blue Note samples became more embedded in the grooves and experimental tracks like "Snakes" (in 5/4) and the [[spoken-word]] "Sheep".

More touring followed, but personnel changes within Blue Note's parent company, [[Capitol Records]], allowed Wilkinson to leave and sign to Sony, working with the A&R executive that initially signed him in 1992.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}. Blue Note samples were not included and two new vocalists joined the group: rapper Michelob, and singer Alison Crockett. However, before the album was complete, a major personnel change at Sony left Us3 in limbo.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}.

Eventually the third Us3 album, ''[[An Ordinary Day in an Unusual Place]]'', was released in 2001 by Toshiba EMI in Japan and Universal in Europe. The album itself represented a new direction for the group's sound, incorporating elements of [[drum 'n bass]], Latin, and Indian music into the mix. Several European and Japanese tours took place throughout 2002, but once again there were major label personnel cuts that left Us3 without a label.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

A deal was concluded and the fourth Us3 album, ''Questions'', was released in Japan by Toshiba EMI in 2003. Brooklyn male rapper Reggi Wyns and London-based South African female singer Mpho Skeef were the featured vocalists. ''Questions'' was the first Us3 album to be released independently (outside Japan) on the Us3.com label. Two tours of Europe in 2005 resulted in 50 performances in 14 countries.

After the tour, the eclectic more jazz-influenced album ''[[Schizophonic (Us3 album)|Schizophonic]]'' was recorded. All members of the Us3 live band were featured, including Chris Storr, [[Ed Jones (jazz musician)|Ed Jones]], Neville Malcolm, DJ First Rate, Mike Gorman, Sean Hargreaves, John Crawford, and Ernie Cranenburgh. ''Schizophonic'' also featured two new rappers, Akil Dasan and Gaston, both of whom Wilkinson found at New York's underground hangout, the [[Nuyorican Poets Café]]. The Us3 band toured again, playing in Russia (Moscow and St Petersburg) for the first time.

The 2007 album ''Say What!?'' once again included rappers Akil Dasan and Gaston and added 21-year-old R&B vocalist Adeline Petricien.

In 2009, Us3 released the grittier more hip-hop influenced album ''Stop. Think. Run'' featuring spoken word artist turned rapper, Brook Yung and Sene. The live band performed 39 shows in 17 different countries. Influential US hip-hop website RapReviews.com made ''Stop. Think. Run'' the seventh best hip-hop album of 2009.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

October 2011 saw Us3 release their eighth album, ''Lie, Cheat & Steal'', featuring the New York-based Puerto Rican rapper/spoken word artist, Oveous Maximus, and UK rapper [[Akala (rapper)|Akala]]. During the same month, the eight-piece live Us3 band embarked on a European tour in promotion of the album.

2013 marked the 20th anniversary of the release of "Cantaloop (Flip Fantasia)" and the album ''Hand on the Torch'', and a remastered package with new remixes was released in celebration. A new album titled ''The Third Way (Hand on the Torch Vol II)'' featuring rappers KCB, Tukka, and Akil Dasan was also released in 2013.
