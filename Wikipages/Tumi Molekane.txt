Tumi was also involved in the [[Dead Prez]] show around late in 2000 and also took part in the Black August tour to South Africa in 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.africasgateway.com/2003/03/25/open-minds-16-april-2003/ |title=Open Minds 16 April 2003 |date=23 March 2003 |work=Africa's Gateway |access-date=15 October 2012}}</ref>

He has also performed with South African recording artists [[Blk Sonshine]], [[Keorapetse Kgositsile]], [[Watkin Tudor Jones]], [[Lesego Rampolokeng]]. Saul Williams, Sarah Jones and [[Mutabaruka]]. He has also worked alongside [[Chinese Man]], a French Hip-Hop crew, producing the album ''The Journey'' together in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |URL=https://www.chinesemanrecords.com/shop-cmr/tumi-chinese-man-the-journey/ |title= THE JOURNEY – TUMI & CHINESE MAN - CHINESE MAN RECORDS |access-date=13 February 2020}}</ref>

In his book ''Stealing Empire: P2P, Intellectual Property and Hip-hop Subversion'' (2008), Professor Adam Haupt of the [[University of Cape Town]] analyzed the lyrics Molekane wrote for the Tumi and the Volume song "76", as well as others. Among Haupt's arguments are that contemporary hip hop music provides critical insights into the inheritance of violence in post-[[apartheid]] South Africa.<ref>{{cite book |title=Stealing Empire: P2P, Intellectual Property and Hip-hop Subversion |last=Haupt |first=Adam |year=2008 |publisher=Human Sciences Research Council |location=[[Cape Town]] |isbn=9780796922090 |oclc= 184829137 |pages=157, 202&ndash;209 }}</ref>

He contends that, despite commercial and often sexist imperatives in mainstream hip hop music, South Africa has produced a number of socially conscious hip hop artists, who are reluctant to compromise their art and political views. In 2016, he was featured on Ghanaian rapper M.anifest's album ''Nowhere Cool''.
In 2018 Stogie released ''Honey and Pain'', which is the follow up to his eponymous 2016 album. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.music.org.za/artist.asp?id=180 |title=Tumi & The Volume (South Africa) |work=music.org.za |publisher=Making Music Productions |access-date=15 October 2012}}</ref>
