==History==
=== Formation (2008–2010) ===
{{Further|Ronnie Radke|Escape the Fate}}In 2008, lead singer Ronnie Radke was involved in an altercation in [[Las Vegas]] that resulted in the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Cook. While Radke did not shoot Cook, he was indicted on battery charges. These charges, combined with Radke's past troubles with narcotics and rehab, led to a suspended sentence and five years probation. After he failed to report to his probation officer he was arrested in June 2008, where his probation was revoked and he was mandated to serve his original sentence of two years in prison.<ref name="Former Escape The Fate Vocalist Ronnie Radke Returns With New Band ‘Falling in Reverse’">{{cite web|url=http://chemical-magazine.com/2011/06/13/former-escape-the-fate-vocalist-ronnie-radke-returns-with-new-band-falling-in-reverse/|publisher=Chemical Magazine|author=Cassie Crue|title=Former Escape The Fate Vocalist Ronnie Radke Returns With New Band 'Falling in Reverse'|date=June 13, 2011|access-date=July 8, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326014404/http://chemical-magazine.com/2011/06/13/former-escape-the-fate-vocalist-ronnie-radke-returns-with-new-band-falling-in-reverse/|archive-date=March 26, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="Ronnie Radke Returns To The World of Music">{{cite web|url=http://www.metal.com/news/article/Ronnie+Radke+Returns+To+The+World+of+Music|publisher=Metal|author=Andy Re.|title=Ronnie Radke Returns to the World of Music|date=June 11, 2011|access-date=July 3, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701150038/http://www.metal.com/news/article/Ronnie+Radke+Returns+To+The+World+of+Music|archive-date=July 1, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> At the time, Ronnie Radke was the lead singer of post-hardcore band [[Escape the Fate]], which in 2006, released its debut album, ''[[Dying Is Your Latest Fashion]]''.

Radke discussed his relationship with Escape the Fate members since his departure from the band, stating that they have tried to reconcile with Radke but he was uninterested in getting back on friendly terms with them after they kicked him out and misinformed their fans about Radke getting caught with heroin inside prison. Radke stated in an interview, <blockquote>"They make a whole album called ''[[This War Is Ours]]'', and then they try to say, 'We didn't name that album after you, dude.' Which in fact, they did. I could be wrong; they could be talking about the war on terrorism or something. I don't know. But I just have a feeling that record name was about me. They talk a lot of shit.

The lyrical content of the band's music is inspired mainly by vocalist Radke's personal experiences, which include his mother, the corruption of Las Vegas, and his incarceration/release from prison due to multiple run-ins with the law involving narcotics and battery charges related to the death of Michael Cook. No songs by the band to date concern love because Radke stated that, "...I'm not going to lie ... and try to write songs on how much I love somebody.
