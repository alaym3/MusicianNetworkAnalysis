==Biography==
[[File:Kavinsky.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Kavinsky in 2007]]
After many years as an actor, Kavinsky's musical career started in 2005 after being inspired by his close friends [[Jackson and his Computer Band|Jackson Fourgeaud]] and [[Mr. Oizo|Quentin Dupieux]], the latter director also included Kavinsky's music in his film ''Steak''. During this period Kavinsky produced his first single "Testarossa Autodrive" which was inspired by the [[Ferrari Testarossa|Testarossa]] model of [[Ferrari]] (one of which Vincent drives in real life).<ref name="bigstereo1"/> Kavinsky presented the single to Quentin, who in turn presented it to a record label he had access to because of his filming career, and Kavinsky signed with Record Makers.<ref name=kavbio>{{cite web|last=Rhoads |first=Celeste |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/kavinsky-mn0000907351 |title=Kavinsky - Music Biography, Credits and Discography |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=20 January 2013}}</ref><ref name="bigstereo2">Belorgey, V.

Kavinsky went on to release three [[Extended play|EPs]] on the Record Makers label: ''[[Teddy Boy (EP)|Teddy Boy]]'' in 2006, ''[[1986 (Kavinsky EP)|1986]]'' a year later, and ''[[Nightcall (song)|Nightcall]]'' with [[Lovefoxxx]] of [[CSS (band)|CSS]] in 2010.<ref name="bigstereo2"/> Kavinsky toured alongside [[Daft Punk]], [[The Rapture (band)|The Rapture]], [[Justice (French band)|Justice]], and [[Sebastian (French musician)|SebastiAn]] in 2007.<ref name="slideshare1">Linkedin, & Slideshare. (28 January 2012). Kavinsky [Speech transcript]. Retrieved 12 December 2012, from Slideshare website: http://www.slideshare.net/Skywalker2011/kavinsky-11785946</ref>

The SebastiAn remix of "Testarossa Autodrive" off the ''1986'' EP is featured in the video games ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' and ''[[Gran Turismo 5 Prologue]]''. Kavinsky's single "Nightcall" was featured in the opening credits of the film ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'', and became a major hit soon after.<ref name="slideshare1"/>

In December 2012 he released "ProtoVision" and on 25 February 2013 released his debut studio album [[Outrun (album)|''OutRun'']].<ref>Staff. (10 December 2012).

In November 2021, he returned from his seven year hiatus with the lead single "Renegade" from the upcoming second studio album ''Reborn''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.magneticmag.com/2021/10/kavinsky-new-album-reborn-single-arriving-next-month/|title=Kavinsky Announces New Album 'Reborn,' Single Arriving Next Month|first=Ryan|last=Middleton|website=Magnetic Magazine|accessdate=19 November 2021}}</ref> The song is produced by [[Gaspard Augé]] and Victor Le Masne.

==Character history==
Kavinsky is a character made by Vincent Belorgey that has a striking resemblance to Vincent himself but the backstory does not follow anything in Belorgey's history. Kavinsky's story is that after crashing his Testarossa in 1986, he reappeared as a zombie in 2006 to make his own electronic music.<ref name="kavbio"/> Kavinsky's songs help tell his story; Vincent claims in an interview, "'Night Call' is just about the zombie guy [who] goes to his girlfriend's house and says okay I'm not the same, we need to talk", referring to Kavinsky going back to find his girlfriend after the crash who has already moved on with her life.<ref name="bigstereo2"/>

==Equipment==
In interview, Kavinsky stated that the entirety of ''[[Teddy Boy (EP)|Teddy Boy]]'' was written and recorded on a [[Yamaha DX7]], which was famous and notable for the synth-pop sound of the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvwMB7Ziqss |title=Kavinsky Interview |publisher=YouTube |access-date=20 January 2013}}</ref> Kavinsky originally started making music on an old Apple computer given to him by his friend [[Mr. Oizo]].<ref name="bigstereo2"/>
