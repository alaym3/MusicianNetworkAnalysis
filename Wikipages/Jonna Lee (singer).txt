In 2017, Lee started using the moniker '''ionnalee''' for her new solo project. In February 2018 she released her debut solo album, ''[[Everyone Afraid to Be Forgotten]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hogwood |first1=Ben |title=ionnalee - Everyone Afraid To Be Forgotten {{!}} Albums |url=https://www.musicomh.com/reviews/albums/ionnalee-everyone-afraid-forgotten |website=musicOMH |date=16 February 2018 |accessdate=27 January 2019}}</ref> With the album she also created her own world tour co funded by her fans via [[Kickstarter]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Linköping]], Lee grew up in the small village of [[Fågelsta]] with her mother and siblings. No one in her family had any musical background but Lee had an interest in music as a young child, and ran away from home to [[London]] in her teens due to trying conditions at home. In 2002, Lee moved to [[Stockholm]], where she became a part of the underground indie scene. She started recording her own records that were released through her website until she was signed by the Swedish indie label, [[Razzia Records]], in the spring 2007. She released two solo albums and one EP through Razzia Records between 2007 and 2009, but left the label in 2010 and started the independent label "To whom it may concern." to release the audiovisual projects of [[iamamiwhoami]].

==Career==
[[File:Jonna_Lee_20080607.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Lee, seen performing here in 2008, developed iamamiwhoami with Björklund after the release of her second album in 2009]]
Lee released her first solo album ''10 Pieces, 10 Bruises'' on Swedish label Razzia Records on 10 October 2007. The first single was "Dried Out Eyes," followed by "And Your Love," a duet with [[Ed Harcourt]], who also produced three tracks on the album. Lee produced the rest of the record with her collaborator, [[Claes Björklund]] who is a member of [[Travis (band)|Travis]] in London. [[Supergrass]] drummer [[Danny Goffey]] plays drums on the record. Some songs were recorded in Goffey's house in England. In September 2008, she released a five-track EP titled ''This War''. Her second studio album ''This Is Jonna Lee'', produced by [[Claes Björklund]] and Lee herself, was released in February 2009.

In October 2009, she released a version of the industrial electro band [[Nitzer Ebb]]'s song "Violent Playground". The band celebrated it by uploading Lee's version on their website along with an interview with her. Between December 2009 and December 2016, Lee has released music and films under the pseudonym [[iamamiwhoami]] together with producer [[Claes Björklund]] and their visual collaborators.
