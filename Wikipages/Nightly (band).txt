==History==
Cousins Jonathan Capeci and Joey Beretta grew up together around [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. Throughout their childhood and teenage years, they played in a number of bands together, but as they reached college, they dropped out and relocated to [[Nashville]] to pursue their project at the time, [[Dinner And A Suit]]. As that project dissolved, Capeci and Beretta regrouped with friends Stephen Cunsolo and Nicholas Sainato to form Nightly. The project lacked momentum until they signed with [[Interscope Records]] in July 2016,<ref>https://www.instagram.com/p/BIc3wDDjUd-/</ref> and began work on their debut EP.

After the release of the leading single, "XO" on May 10, Nightly's first EP, titled ''Honest'', was released on October 21, 2016. The EP contained 4 songs, with "XO" being the most successful. [[Spotify]] featured "XO" on multiple playlists throughout the Summer, which skyrocketed it to over 2 million plays in a matter of weeks.<ref>{{cite tweet|number=734520676304998403|user=jonathancapeci|title=last week we released a song. doesn't feel real. thx to @spotify and every1 who shared. this is impossible w/o you.<!-- full text of tweet that Twitter returned to the bot (excluding links) added by TweetCiteBot.

On March 6, 2017, Nightly released their first music video for the track "XO" off of their debut EP. They collaborated on the video with Tobias Nathan and Jake Saner. Capeci said that they picked Nathan specifically for the video due to his grasp on color.<ref name=clipped/> They have worked with Nathan again on their upcoming music video for "Talk To Me", due out in 2017.{{Update inline|date=December 2020|reason=}}

The band toured extensively throughout the end of 2016 and beginning of 2017, opening for acts like [[Ke$ha]], [[The All-American Rejects]], [[Zella Day]], and [[K.Flay]]. After being featured at the We Found New Music showcase at [[SXSW]], they found their footing and embarked on their first headline tour in April 2017, with support from Saint Mesa. They finished out their year of touring with bands such as [[Urban Cone]], [[The Struts]], and The Night Game, while also playing at [[Bonnaroo]] for the first time.

On January 22, 2018, Nightly was announced as support for [[NF (rapper)|NF]] on his sold-out headline USA tour. They performed on 28 dates of this tour, earning them a massive following on social media. While on tour, Nightly released their single "Miss You Like Hell" on February 16. Soon followed up by their most recent single "Holding On", released on March 22.

In August 2019, the band announced that they had signed a new record deal with BMG. In the notes app screenshots they shared on social media, they also explained how challenging the past year was and that they needed to postpone their upcoming tour.<ref name="NIGHTLY Inks Contract With BMG"/>
