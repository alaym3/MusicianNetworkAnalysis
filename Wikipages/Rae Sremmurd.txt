===2008–2012: Career beginnings and Dem Outta St8 Boyz===
The Brown brothers met Jemiah Middlebrooks in Tupelo while he was playing basketball at a local park.<ref name="OurStage Page">{{cite web|url=http://ourstage.com/profile/demouttast8boyz|title=Dem Outta St8 Boyz OurStage Page|website=OurStage.com}}</ref> They decided to found a [[hip hop band]] called "Dem Outta St8 Boyz" with him. Aaquil took the stage name "CaliBoy," Khalif "Kid Krunk," and Jemiah "Lil Pantz."<ref name="OurStage Page" /> They used money from their [[Part-time contract|part-time jobs]] to buy equipment and to produce music at home.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.redbull.com/gb-en/top-10-best-rae-sremmurd-songs|title=Top 10 Best Rae Sremmurd Songs|last1=Winkie|first1=Luke|date=February 10, 2017|website=RedBull.com|publisher=[[Red Bull]]}}</ref> The two brothers were composing their own beats and the trio were rapping. Visibly inspired by [[Soulja Boy Tell'Em]], the boys released songs and dance videos on social media.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://myspace.com/kidkrunk1/ |title=Kid Krunk MySpace Page|website=MySpace.com|publisher=[[MySpace]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhY8RRPD-lE | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211109/DhY8RRPD-lE| archive-date=2021-11-09 | url-status=live|title=put it in rotation by dem outta st8 boyz - YouTube|date=February 8, 2009|website=YouTube.com|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref> It was at the same time that the group first met, and then later became friends with Jermarcus Jackson, aka JJ (today known as Jay Sremm), a young [[disc jockey]], who was studying at [[Tupelo High School]] with the two brothers. He since became the DJ of the group.<ref name="The Fader Article" />

Shortly after, Bernadette Walker and her companion split up. Following the breakup, the two brothers started skipping school and working more seriously on music. They would return home at late hours, even when they had school the next morning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.40671/title.rae-sremmurd-reveals-why-they-got-kicked-out-of-their-mamas-crib-on-highly-questionable#|title=Rae Sremmurd Reveal Why They Got Kicked Out Of Their Mama's Crib On "Highly Questionable"|last1= Johnson|first1=Cherise|date=October 1, 2016 |website=HipHopDX.com|publisher=[[HipHopDX]]|access-date=March 23, 2017}}</ref> Their mother, fed up with their schedules, eventually kicked them out of her house, leaving them homeless. They began squatting in an abandoned house in the city with a friend of their stepfather's. They took advantage of the opportunity and organized parties in their new home in order to spread their music.<ref name="The Fader Article" />

At the beginning of 2010, the group released the single "Party Animal",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cv2JOmelJrM | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211109/cv2JOmelJrM| archive-date=2021-11-09 | url-status=live|title=DEM OUTTA ST8 BOYZ - PARTY ANIMAL!! |date=February 7, 2010|website=YouTube.com|publisher=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref> which gave them a local fame, allowing them to perform at these local festivals and to broadcast their tracks on local radios.<ref name="Noisey Article" /><ref name="The Fader Article" /> Thanks to their savings, the group took part in the auditions of the "Wild Out Wednesday" segment on [[BET]]'s show ''[[106 & Park]]'' in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and succeeded to qualify. They participated on the show of December 8 in [[New York City]] and performed "Party Animal".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://djournal.com/news/local-folks-hip-hop-group-getting-bet-spotlight/|title=LOCAL FOLKS: Hip-hop group getting BET spotlight|last1=Morris|first1=Scott|date=December 6, 2010|website=DJournal.com|publisher=Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal}}</ref> Later, the group met a young rapper, named Andre "King Dre" Harris (today known as BoBo Swae), while he was freestyling in the high school courtyard.<ref name="ReverNation Page" /> Andre, originally from [[West Point, Mississippi]], started collaborating with the trio.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28jICvG08Sg | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211109/28jICvG08Sg| archive-date=2021-11-09 | url-status=live|title=DA OUTTA ST8 BOYZ - YouTube|date=May 7, 2011|website=YouTube.com|publisher=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Months later, the group finally released their first project, distributed locally.<ref name="Party Animals CD">{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/y3MNMfmXPi/ |title=Party Animals CD Project|date=2015|website=Instagram.com|publisher=Bernadette Walker [[Instagram]] Page}}</ref>

In the middle of 2011, Lil Pantz left the group due to legal problems and was replaced by Andre.<ref name="The Fader Article" /> Aaquil and Khalif took the opportunity to change their stage names from "CaliBoy" and "King Krunk" to "Weirdo" and "Kid The Great," respectively.<ref name="ReverNation Page" /> In August 2011, the trio once again participated in ''106 & Park'' and performed an original song "My Diddy".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELvKpcwqLKM | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211109/ELvKpcwqLKM| archive-date=2021-11-09 | url-status=live|title=106 and park Outta St8 Boys Rappin - YouTube|date=August 17, 2011|website=YouTube.com|publisher=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bet.com/shows/106-and-park/photos/wild-out-wednesdays/2011/wild-out-wednesday-teen-male-hip-hop-r-b-competition.html#!081811-shows-106-park-WOW-diggy-simmons-rocsi-2|title=Wild Out Wednesday - Teen Male R&B and Hip-Hop Competition|date=August 2011|publisher=[[BET]]|access-date=May 2, 2015}}</ref> They finished second place overall in the competition, and arranged meetings with representatives from record labels [[Def Jam Recordings]] and [[Sony Music]]. However, they did not sign any record deals at that time.

Around this time, Jemarcus put the group in touch with producer Pierre "P-Nazty" Slaughter, a cousin of his, who had grown up in Tupelo but had moved to [[Atlanta]] to work with [[Mike Will Made It]]'s record label EarDrummers. P-Nazty appreciated the teenagers' music and decided to work with them. Thereby, the three rappers left Tupelo and spent a few months with P-Nazty and Marquel "Marz" Middlebrooks (another EarDrummers producer) in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].<ref name="The Fader Article" /> They took the opportunity to perform in talent shows and recorded the track "I Dip", produced by Marz, and which increased their popularity a little more.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nnjo7A02pHU | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211109/Nnjo7A02pHU| archive-date=2021-11-09 | url-status=live|title=Outta St8/Atlanta GA - performing Dip /with video shoot LUNEY tunes (I Dip) Prod by Eardrummers Mars - YouTube|date=March 20, 2012|website=YouTube.com|publisher=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref> They released their second project "''Three Stooges Mixtape''" at the beginning of 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.datpiff.com/Outta-St8-Three-Stooges-Mixtape.302500.html |title=Outta St8 - Three Stooges Mixtape - Stream & Download|date=January 8, 2012|website=DatPiff.com|publisher=DatPiff}}</ref>

Unfortunately, due to financial problems, the boys had to return to their hometown, causing the group to temporarily dissolve. The brothers began working to save money; Aaquil worked at a mattress factory, and Khalif worked at a fast food restaurant where he served burgers. They were working about 12 hours per day.<ref name="MySpace Article">{{cite web|url=https://myspace.com/article/2014/06/27/rae-sremmurd-no-flex-zone|title=Rae Sremmurd Is Declaring a "No Flex Zone!!" in Hip-Hop|last1=Lee|first1=Christina|date=June 27, 2014|website=MySpace.com|publisher=MySpace}}</ref> When Aaquil turned 21, he rented an apartment into which Khalif and Andre moved. They began recording music and organizing parties on weekends again. Despite this, the rappers had problems with the police due to noise complaints and with their landlord when they stopped mowing their lawn.<ref name="The Fader Article" /> Meanwhile, P-Nazty and Marz, aware of the potential and motivation of the trio, tried to convince the rappers to leave their work and to return to Atlanta to try again to succeed in music.<ref name="MySpace Article" /> After that Aaquil resigned, anticipating that he wouldn't pass a drug test, the trio decided to return to [[Nicknames of Atlanta|Atlanta]] thanks to Andre, who had a car.<ref name="The Fader Article" />

===2013–2015: Early success and ''SremmLife''===
{{Main|SremmLife}}
Back in Georgia, the group worked a lot, performed in local shows, and got attention in the Atlanta indie hip hop scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reverbnation.com/raesremmurd|title=Rae Semmurd ReverbNation Page|website=ReverbNation.com|publisher=ReverbNation}}</ref> P-Nazty introduced them to Mike Will Made It, who decided to sign them on his indie label, Made-It Mafia. In the meantime, King Dre decided to leave the group due to familial reasons and moved to [[Florida]] to focus on his studies.<ref name="The Fader Article" />
The now-duo decided to change their stage names again. The group took as their new name "Rae Sremmurd", derived from Mike Will Made It's production team "EarDrummers" by spelling both words backwards. Aaquil chose the name of "Slim Jimmy" (later stylized as "Slim Jxmmi"), and Khalif opted for first "iHipster Lee" then a few months later "Swae Lee."<ref name="ThroSumMo Party">{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/RaeSremmurd/photos/a.466604443439013.1073741830.452997968132994/466604306772360/?type=3|title=ThroSumMo Single Release Party flyer|website=Facebook.com|publisher=Rae Sremmurd Facebook Page|date=January 9, 2014}}</ref> When Mike Will Made It finalized the creation of his major label "[[EarDrummers Entertainment]]" in partnership with [[Interscope Records]], the two brothers became the first artists to sign.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Russel|first1=Alex|title=Interview: Mike WiLL Made-It Talks Starting Ear Drummers, Inspiring Kanye West & Educating Rae Sremmurd|url=http://uk.complex.com/music/2015/03/mike-will-made-it-interview|website=Complex.com|publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=March 16, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519173408/http://http/|archive-date=May 19, 2011}}</ref>
