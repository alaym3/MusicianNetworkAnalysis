'''Omega''' is a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] rock band formed in 1962, which has been described as the most successful Hungarian rock band in history.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Omega {{!}} Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/omega-mn0001073347/biography|access-date=2020-07-28|website=AllMusic|language=en-us}}</ref> They have released more than 20 albums both in Hungarian and English. After several early personnel changes, their classic lineup came together in 1971 and was intact for more than forty years. Singer János Kóbor has been with the band continuously since 1962; keyboardist/singer László Benkő was present from 1962 until his death in 2020; while guitarist György Molnár and drummer Ferenc Debreczeni joined in 1967 and 1971 respectively. Bassist Tamás Mihály was a member of the band from 1967 to 2017. They have won several prestigious awards for their contributions to Hungarian culture.

== History ==
Omega was formed in [[Budapest]] in 1962 by Benkő and Kóbor, with trombonist Győző Bánkúti, drummer Tamás Künsztler, saxophonist Péter Láng, guitarist Ferenc Tornóczky, and bassist István Varsányi. The members had all been in previous bands at the same grammar school.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Cselszövésből lett az Omega|url=http://www.blikk.hu/blikk_sztarvilag/cselszovesbol-lett-az-omega-2111955|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206033257/http://www.blikk.hu/blikk_sztarvilag/cselszovesbol-lett-az-omega-2111955|archive-date=2012-12-06|access-date=2013-01-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Láng Péter interjú - 1. rész (2016)|url=http://www.passzio.hu/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=35954|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927013811/http://www.passzio.hu/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=35954|archive-date=2016-09-27|access-date=2016-09-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Bánkúti Győző - interjú (2016)|url=http://www.passzio.hu/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=36349|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220152341/http://www.passzio.hu/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=36349|archive-date=2016-12-20|access-date=2016-12-18}}</ref> Their first concert was at Budapest's University of Technology and Economics in September 1962.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Beszélgetés egy igazi legendával -Interjú Kóbor Jánossal, az Omega énekesével|url=https://www.lelleikulturpark.hu/index.php/hu/interjuk?view=article&id=128:beszelgetes-egy-igazi-legendaval-interju-kobor-janossal-az-omega-enekesevel&catid=17:interju|access-date=2020-05-21|work=lelleikulturpark.hu}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Tornóczky Ferenc - interjú (2017)|url=http://www.passzio.hu/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=36942|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302112148/http://www.passzio.hu/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=36942|archive-date=2017-03-02|access-date=2017-03-01}}</ref> The band went through many personnel changes in its first several years, and mostly played covers of British rock songs.<ref name=":0" />  

Omega first began to write their own songs with the arrival in 1967 of keyboardist/singer [[Gábor Presser]], who was adept in rock, jazz, and folk songwriting.<ref name=":0" /> Guitarist György Molnár and bassist/singer Tamás Mihály also joined in 1967. The following year, the band was invited to tour England, where they recorded their debut album ''Omega: Red Star From Hungary'' with English lyrics for [[Decca Records]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=OMEGA - Omega Red Star: From Hungary (1968)|url=https://www.progarchives.com/album.asp?id=16860|access-date=2020-07-28|website=Progarchives.com|language=en}}</ref> Later that year, the album was re-recorded in Hungarian and released in the band's home country as ''Trombitás Frédi és a Rettenetes Emberek'' (''Trumpeter Freddy and the Terrible People'').<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=OMEGA : Trombitás Frédi És A Rettenetes Emberek - CD - HUNGAROTON - Forced Exposure|url=https://www.forcedexposure.com/Catalog/omega-trombit-s-fr-di-s-a-rettenetes-emberek-cd/HUNG.17390CD.html|access-date=2020-07-28|website=www.forcedexposure.com}}</ref> The band's sound during this period included experiments in [[psychedelic rock]]. Their 1969 song "[[Gyöngyhajú lány]]" ("The Girl With Pearls in Her Hair") was an international hit, and was later covered by [[Scorpions (band)|the Scorpions]].<ref name=":0" /> During this period, members of Omega also gained notice for backing several Hungarian pop singers, most notably [[Sarolta Zalatnay]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Batey|first=Angus|date=2015-10-13|title=Cult heroes: Sarolta Zalatnay, the Hungarian Janis Joplin who was key to rock's evolution|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/oct/13/cult-heroes-sarolta-zalatnay-hungary-janis-joplin-rock|access-date=2020-07-24|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

In 1971, Gábor Presser and drummer József Laux (who had joined in 1964) left Omega and formed the progressive rock band [[Locomotiv GT]]. ([[Tamás Somló]], who had played saxophone for Omega from 1964 to 1968, became bassist for Locomotiv GT in 1973,)<ref name=":02">{{Cite web|title=Locomotiv GT - europopmusic|url=https://www.europopmusic.eu/Eastern_Europe_Pages/Locomotiv_GT.html|access-date=2020-07-24|website=www.europopmusic.eu}}</ref> Presser was not replaced, while the band recruited new drummer Ferenc Debreczeni. The resulting lineup of Kóbor (vocals), Benkő (keyboards/vocals), Molnár (guitar), Mihály (bass/vocals), and Debreczeni (drums) remained intact for more than 40 years until Mihály retired from touring in 2014. Presser's jazz- and folk-oriented keyboards and songwriting had been dominant in Omega's sound; after his departure the band moved toward [[progressive rock]] and [[space rock]] with Benkő's classically-oriented keyboards and Molnár's heavy guitar as the focus.<ref name=":0" /> 

This incarnation of Omega released ten more albums starting in 1972 until taking an extended break in 1987. Most of those were released in both Hungarian and English versions. During the 1970s in particular, some of the band's albums were restricted or banned in Hungary due to the Communist regime's view that hard rock music was subversive.<ref>{{Cite web|date=1987-09-05|title=Omega's Staying Power : Rock Group Keeps Beat in Hungary|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-09-05-mn-1637-story.html|access-date=2020-07-28|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US}}</ref> However, they were able to tour in East Germany and recorded some songs in German for their fans in that country.<ref name=":0" /> During this period they were also noted for science fiction-oriented lyrics.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Omega - europopmusic|url=https://www.europopmusic.eu/Eastern_Europe_Pages/Omega.html|access-date=2020-07-28|website=www.europopmusic.eu}}</ref> After their thirteenth album ''Babylon'' in 1987, Omega went on hiatus so the members could focus on side projects.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=OMEGA Babylon [Ω XIII] reviews|url=https://www.progarchives.com/album-reviews.asp?id=3745|access-date=2020-07-28|website=Progarchives.com|language=en}}</ref> 

[[File:Omega (együttes).jpg|thumb|Omega performing in 2010 (L-R: Debreceni, Kóbor, Molnár, Mihály, Benkő)]]
Omega regrouped in 1994 for a major concert at [[Ferenc Puskás Stadium|Népstadion]] in Budapest, with special appearances by former members Gábor Presser and Tamás Somló, plus [[Rudolf Schenker]] and [[Klaus Meine]] of the Scorpions.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2009-02-27|title=Az Omega is szerepel a Scorpions koncertjén!|language=hu-HU|work=Fémforgács|url=https://www.femforgacs.hu/news-6188-az_omega_is_szerepel_a_scorpions_koncertjen/|access-date=2020-07-28}}</ref> Following the collapse of Communism in Hungary, most of Omega's previously suppressed albums were released on CD and generated great interest in the band as it returned to performing in 1994.<ref name=":0" /> Their first new album after reuniting was ''Trans and Dance'' in 1995.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Omega: Trans and Dance|url=https://zene.hu/kiadvanyok/reszletek.php?id=4772|access-date=2020-07-28|website=Zene.hu|language=hu}}</ref>

In later years, the nation of Hungary bestowed many awards on the band for their important contributions to the country's music and culture, including the Hungarian National Award in 1998,<ref name=":0" /> the [[Kossuth Prize]] in 2013,<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Archivált másolat|url=http://hetivalasz.hu/itthon/ime-a-kossuth-dijasok-listaja-61700/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318134706/http://hetivalasz.hu/itthon/ime-a-kossuth-dijasok-listaja-61700/|archive-date=2013-03-18|access-date=2013-03-15}}</ref> and the Liszt Ferenc Prize in 1986.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=Archivált másolat|url=http://omega.hu/cikk.php?cat=1980&i=60|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204233824/http://omega.hu/cikk.php?cat=1980&i=60|archive-date=2015-02-04|access-date=2013-03-27}}</ref> For their 50th anniversary in 2012, Omega toured with a symphony under the name "Omega Rhapsody".<ref>{{Cite web|title=OMEGA - Omega Rhapsody (2010)|url=https://www.progarchives.com/album.asp?id=32203|access-date=2020-07-28|website=Progarchives.com|language=en}}</ref> Longtime bassist Tamás Mihály, who had been with the band since 1967, retired from live performances in 2014, though his departure was not officially announced until 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Királyi hét Nagyváradon az Omegával|url=https://kronikaonline.ro/erdelyi-hirek/kiralyi-het-nagyvaradon-az-omegaval|access-date=2020-07-28|website=kronikaonline.ro|language=hu}}</ref> The band continues to tour regularly with a rotating cast of sidemen, and the album ''55 - Volt Egyszer Egy Vadkelet'' was released in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|title=OMEGA - Omega 55: Volt Egyszer Egy Vadkelet (2017)|url=https://www.progarchives.com/album.asp?id=55887|access-date=2020-07-28|website=Progarchives.com|language=en}}</ref>
