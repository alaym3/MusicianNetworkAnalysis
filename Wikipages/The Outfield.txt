'''The Outfield''' were an English rock band based in London, England.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6150467/john-spinks-guitarist-songwriter-the-outfield-dead-60 |title=John Spinks dies aged 60 |work=Billboard|access-date=6 December 2015}}</ref> The band achieved success in the mid-1980s and are best remembered for their [[hit single]], "[[Your Love (The Outfield song)|Your Love]]". The band's lineup consisted of guitarist [[John Spinks (musician)|John Spinks]], vocalist and bassist [[Tony Lewis (musician)|Tony Lewis]], and drummer Alan Jackman.

They had an unusual experience for a British band in that they enjoyed commercial success in the US, but never in their homeland. The band began recording during the mid-1980s,<ref name=stacia>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5083/biography|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=[[All Music Guide]]|first=Stacia|last=Proefrock|title=The Outfield – Biography|access-date=3 July 2010}}</ref> and released their first album, ''[[Play Deep]]'', in 1985 through [[Columbia Records]]. The album reached No.&nbsp;9 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] list and then reached [[Music recording sales certification|triple platinum]] in the United States.<ref name=mike>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r14676|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=[[All Music Guide]]|title=Play Deep – Overview|access-date=3 July 2010|first=Mike|last=DeGagne}}</ref> The band's single "Your Love" reached No.&nbsp;6 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] as well as No.&nbsp;7 on the [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock]] chart,<ref name="mike"/> and it became their [[signature song]]. The band continued to record and tour through the 1980s and then into the early 1990s.<ref name=stacia/> While subsequent albums ''[[Bangin']]'' (1987) and ''[[Voices of Babylon]]'' (1989) saw some chart successes, the group's popularity waned.

Drummer Alan Jackman left and, now as a duo, they recorded ''[[Diamond Days (The Outfield album)|Diamond Days]]'' in 1991. After the disappointing response to their 1992 album ''[[Rockeye]]'', which represented a shift towards [[progressive rock]] and [[arena rock]],<ref name=rock>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r59576|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=[[All Music Guide]]|first=Joe|last=Viglione|title=Rockeye – Overview|access-date=7 July 2010}}</ref> the group essentially disbanded in the 1990s.<ref name=stacia/> They resumed touring in 1998, and thereafter released two live albums via their website, along with a new studio album, ''[[Any Time Now (The Outfield album)|Any Time Now]]'' in 2004, which was later re-released in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r822178|pure_url=yes}}| first= Stephen Thomas |last= Erlewine| author-link= Stephen Thomas Erlewine |title=Any Time Now – Overview|access-date=3 July 2010|publisher=All Music Guide}}</ref> In 2011, the band released their final album, ''[[Replay (The Outfield album)|Replay]]'', with original drummer Alan Jackman re-joining the band. Spinks died in 2014 after which the group officially disbanded. On 22 March 2018, lead singer/bassist Tony Lewis announced a solo album called ''Out of the Darkness'', which was released on 29 June 2018 through Madison Records.<ref name="madisonrecords.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.madisonrecords.com/news/2018/3/22/deep-dive-with-tony-lewis|title=Deep Dive with Tony Lewis from The Outfield}}</ref>

Two of the original members have died: John Spinks in 2014, from cancer; and Tony Lewis in 2020.

==History==
===Formation and commercial success (1984–1986)===
Bassist/singer Tony Lewis, guitarist/keyboardist and songwriter [[John Spinks (musician)|John Spinks]] and drummer Alan Jackman played together in the late 1970s in a straightforward [[power pop]] band called Sirius B. After rehearsing for about six months and playing several gigs, their style did not match the [[punk rock]] that was surging in popularity in England and they broke up.<ref name="dfp">{{cite news|title=Outfield gets a grip on musical success|date=28 July 1986| first= Gary |last= Graff|work=[[Detroit Free Press]]|page=4C}}</ref> Several years afterward, the three gathered back together in London's East End under the name '''The Baseball Boys'''. They performed in and around England until a demo got them signed to [[Columbia Records|Columbia/CBS Records]] in 1984.<ref name=tribune/>

Spinks adopted the name 'Baseball Boys' from a teen gang called "The Baseball Furies" in the [[cult film]] ''[[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors]]'', a movie that he had just seen. Although he used the name as a joke and "just to be outrageous",<ref name="lat"/> record company people responded favourably. The band got a reputation as a very "American-sounding" group and signed in the US after playing for just a few months in England. Their manager, an American living in England, recommended a new band name with a similar attitude since 'Baseball Boys' seemed too "tacky" and "tongue-in-cheek". Spinks has said, "The Outfield was the most left-wing kind of thing we liked."<ref name=tribune>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-08-01/entertainment/8602250485_1_alan-jackman-john-spinks-band/2|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|title=In This Outfield, They Root, Root, Root For Soccer|date=1 August 1986|first=Tom|last=Popson}}</ref>

Spinks expressed an interest in the American sport of [[baseball]], while also being a devoted fan of [[association football]]. He claimed that the group "didn't know what an outfield was" until they visited the U.S., and that, "We're just learning about baseball. It's an acquired taste and we're trying to acquire a taste for it."<ref name="lat"/> He expounded upon this in a ''Chicago Tribune'' piece:

{{quote|The thing about American sports – baseball and football – is that they're far more show business, far more a spectacle, than British sports. In England, it's just sort of everyday soccer matches. You get 30,000 people in the freezing cold in the middle of winter watching guys chase around in mud. In America, you have the sunny days, and the baseball diamond is really nicely laid out. In England, you'd see these guys covered in mud within 10 minutes. It's not such a nice spectacle to watch.<ref name=tribune/>}}

===''Play Deep''===
Their debut album, ''[[Play Deep]]'' produced by William Wittman, was issued in 1985 and was a success. The album reached triple platinum sales status and the Top 10 in the US album charts; it also featured a Top 10 single entry with "[[Your Love (The Outfield song)|Your Love]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;6. It went on to be featured in a number of [[1980s in music|80s-themed]] compilation albums,<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=song|id=t814792|pure_url=yes}}|title=Your Love|publisher=[[All Music Guide]]|first=Mike|last=DeGagne|access-date=3 July 2010}}</ref> and over 1,000 [[cover (music)|covers]] and [[remixes]] by other artists have been released physically and/or online.<ref name=cold>{{cite web|url=http://coldfrontmag.com/poets-off-poetry/daniel-nester-josie-reconsidered-notes-on-the-outfield%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cyour-love|author-link= Daniel Nester| first= Daniel |last= Nester|access-date=3 July 2010|title=Josie Reconsidered: Notes on The Outfield’s "Your Love"|date=1 December 2009|publisher=Coldfrontmag.com}}</ref> The band toured extensively, opening for [[Journey (band)|Journey]] and [[Jefferson Airplane#Starship|Starship]]. Spinks made a point of mentioning in interviews that the band was "totally into not smoking or doing drugs".<ref name=tribune/>

===''Bangin’''===
1987 saw the release of their second album, ''[[Bangin']]''.  This album did not achieve the acclaim of ''Play Deep'', but it did spawn a Top 40 single "[[Since You've Been Gone (The Outfield song)|Since You've Been Gone]]" (not to be confused with the 1970s [[Rainbow (English band)|Rainbow]] and [[Head East]] hit of the [[Since You Been Gone|same name]]), which also hit #11 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs chart.  Furthermore, they had a minor radio/MTV hit "No Surrender". The album sold reasonably well and was certified Gold in the United States. A US summer tour opening for [[Night Ranger]] followed.

===''Voices of Babylon''===
For the group's third album, 1989's ''[[Voices of Babylon]]'', a new producer (David Kahne) and sound was evident.  The title track was a Top 25 single and hit #2 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs chart . The follow-up song, "My Paradise", was a mid-sized album-rock hit reaching #34 in the Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs chart but overall the group's popularity continued to decline.

===''Diamond Days''===
After the ''Babylon'' LP, Alan Jackman parted ways with the band and was replaced for a concert tour by Paul Read. Spinks and Lewis continued as a duo, switched labels and began recording ''[[Diamond Days (The Outfield album)|Diamond Days]]'' for [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]]. Playing drums on the disc was session drummer [[Simon Dawson (drummer)|Simon Dawson]]. The LP, released in 1990, produced a Top 30 US hit, "[[For You (The Outfield song)|For You]]". Quick to follow was "One Hot Country", included on the soundtrack for the 1991 action film ''[[If Looks Could Kill (film)|If Looks Could Kill]]''.

===Later years and aftermath===
The Outfield returned with 1992's ''[[Rockeye]]''. Its leadoff single, "Closer to Me", was a near Top 40 hit, and a second release, "Winning It All", gained some notice due to extensive play during [[NBA on NBC|NBC]]'s [[NBA Finals]] coverage, ''[[NBA Superstars]]'' series featuring [[Larry Bird]], the [[1992 Summer Olympics]], [[Chicago Bulls]] championship ring ceremonies and the film ''[[The Mighty Ducks (movies)|The Mighty Ducks]]''. Simon Dawson, who played on ''Rockeye'', would eventually become the band's official third member. The band took an extended hiatus during the mid-1990s as changing musical fashions, especially the popularity of edgier bands such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[Pearl Jam]], made life difficult for older bands with a less fashionable aesthetic.

The Outfield returned to their East End roots, and often played low-key gigs at a local [[Public house|pub]], where much of the clientele were unaware that the group had sold millions of records in the US. Unfortunately, this situation was typical of the problems The Outfield had faced in their homeland: little recognition and a much smaller following than they had experienced in the US.  Nevertheless, the band would reappear with a fan-club-only release, entitled ''[[It Ain't Over...]]'', and resume touring. Soon thereafter, in 1999, they released ''[[Extra Innings (album)|Extra Innings]]'', an odds-and-ends compilation of new and older, unreleased songs.

In the early 2000s, the band issued two live collections via their official website: ''[[Live in Brazil (The Outfield album)|Live in Brazil]]'' and ''[[The Outfield Live]]''. In 2004, the band released ''[[Any Time Now (The Outfield album)|Any Time Now]]'', a new studio album, through [[Tower Records]], and later released a new version of the album in March 2006 through Sidewinder Records.

In 2009, the original line up of John Spinks, Tony Lewis and Alan Jackman returned to a London recording studio to record their first album together since ''[[Voices of Babylon]]'' was recorded in 1988.  In addition, The Outfield announced Brent Bitner had taken over the band's management and launched their official Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and [[MySpace]] pages in November 2009.  On 22 March 2011, The Outfield announced that their upcoming album would be called ''[[Replay (The Outfield album)|Replay]]''. ''Replay'' was recorded in various studios in the south of England that included production work at the legendary Abbey Road Studios. ''Replay'' was produced by The Outfield and Brent Bitner with executive production by John Spinks. On 28 June 2011, ''Replay'' was released to rave reviews. The lead single, "California Sun", was a regional number one AOR chart hit and has subsequently been the second most added song on AC radio as of 15 August 2011. A limited advanced release of the band's possible second single, "A Long, Long Time Ago", reached number one on Worldwide FM ClassX Radio's AOR chart in the second week of August 2011.

In 2013, the band rerecorded vocals to their single "Your Love" to be incorporated into American DJ [[Morgan Page]]'s reworking of the song, which was released in the summer of that year.<ref>{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Steph|title=Morgan Page – "Your Love" (ft. The Outfield) [Release + Interview]|url=http://www.earmilk.com/2013/07/16/morgan-page-your-love-feat-the-outfield-release-interview/|publisher=Earmilk|access-date=29 September 2013}}</ref> Though credited to Page, the single was listed as featuring The Outfield.

On 9 July 2014, John Spinks died of [[liver cancer]]. He was 60 years old.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://ultimateclassicrock.com/outfield-john-spinks-dies/ |title=Outfield Guitarist John Spinks Dies of Liver Cancer |website= Ultimateclassicrock.com |date=4 July 2014 |access-date=11 July 2014}}</ref>

After taking a few years off from music, lead singer/bassist Tony Lewis announced his return with a solo album, ''Out of the Darkness'', which was released on 29 June 2018 through Madison Records<ref name="madisonrecords.com"/> and with the help of his wife Carol and their collaborative songwriting.<ref name= TL-death />

The Outfield was among hundreds of artists whose material was destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=28 June 2019 |date=25 June 2019}}</ref>

On 20 October 2020, singer Tony Lewis died suddenly and unexpectedly at his home near London.<ref name= TL-death>{{cite news| url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/tony-lewis-the-outfield-dead-obituary-1078460/| work= Rolling Stone| title= Tony Lewis, Bassist and Singer for British Pop Rockers the Outfield, Dead at 62| first= Jon| last= Blistein| date= October 20, 2020 | access-date= January 6, 2021}}</ref>

==Style and influences==
The Outfield were considered a [[pop rock]],<ref name=cold/> [[power pop]],<ref name=powerpop/> or a [[New wave music|new wave]] group.<ref name=newwave/> Annelise Wamsley of the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'' described the band's style in 1987: "the Outfield specializes in what you could call an early '80s American Sound. It's music by recipe: You to take hyper-macho hard rock and tone it down so it will appeal to the over-17 set. You need a simple hook that can be repeated a dozen or so times, lots of electric guitar solos, a standard rock beat and basic lyrics."<ref name="tbt"/> John Spinks said in 1986 interview with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that he was very influenced by "the music that gives me a rush" and that he "grew up on [[the Beatles]]". Interestingly, it was also said that the band wanted to be a "car stereo sort of poppy version of the band Rush. "61 Seconds and "Mystery Man" are evidence of this. He also cited contemporaries [[Journey (band)|Journey]], [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], and [[Mr. Mister]] – particularly the latter's hit "[[Broken Wings (Mr. Mister song)|Broken Wings]]". In that interview, he expanded upon the band's strong foundation in melody:

{{quote|I love melodic music. [...] When you look at that music, you have to take it for what it is. I can write a pretty melody. That takes some talent. It may not be complicated and maybe it doesn't challenge anybody, but so what? Some people obviously like it. [...] You don't have to analyze my lyrics to understand them. You enjoy these songs or you don't. You can put these songs on while you're driving. They make you feel good. What more can you ask?<ref name="lat">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-06-01/entertainment/ca-8548_1_outfield-s-music|title=Hit Puts The Outfield Team in the Big Leagues|date=1 June 1986| first= Dennis |last= Hunt|access-date=26 May 2017|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>}}

Wamsely made a similar remark, writing, "This is the stuff people listen to in their cars, on the way to work or play at high school dances."<ref name="tbt">{{cite news|title=The Outfield is knocking; will we let them in?|date=26 June 1987| first= Annelise |last= Wamsley|work=[[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]]|page=3D}}</ref>

Criticism often centered on their generic sound. "The music is hopelessly, numbingly derivative of just about every Journey/Foreigner/[[the Cars|Cars]] cliché in the book — with none of the style that makes those bands special," said Matt Damsker, rock critic for the ''[[Hartford Courant]]''.<ref name="hc">{{cite news|title=Outfield  Has Hits; Errors at Agora|date=19 July 1986| first= Matt |last= Damsker |work= [[Hartford Courant]]|page=C3}}</ref>
