'''Rankin/Bass Animated Entertainment''' (founded and formerly known as '''Videocraft International, Ltd.''' and '''Rankin/Bass Productions, Inc.''') was an American [[production company]] located in New York, New York, and known for its [[seasonal]] [[television special]]s, usually done in [[stop motion]] animation. Rankin/Bass' stop-motion productions are recognizable by their visual style of doll-like characters with spheroid body parts and ubiquitous powdery snow using an animation technique called "Animagic". Often, [[traditional animation|traditional cel animation]] scenes of falling snow would be projected over the action to create the effect of a snowfall.

Nearly all of the studio's animation was [[outsourcing|outsourced]] to Japanese animation companies such as MOM Production, [[Mushi Productions]] and [[Topcraft]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/the-japanese-studios-of-rankinbass/|title=The Japanese Studios of Rankin/Bass |website=cartoonresearch.com|access-date=17 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E03KBgAAQBAJ&q=Rankin%2FBass|title=The Anime Encyclopedia, 3rd Revised Edition: A Century of Japanese Animation|first1=Jonathan|last1=Clements|first2=Helen|last2=McCarthy|date=9 February 2015|publisher=Stone Bridge Press|isbn=9781611729092|access-date=17 March 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref> Rankin/Bass was one of the first western studios to outsource their low-budget animated television and film productions to animation studios in foreign countries; the others that already practiced [[outsourcing of animation|animation outsourcing]] includes [[Total Television]] and [[King Features Syndicate|King Features Syndicate TV]] in New York, New York; and [[Jay Ward Productions]] and [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]] in Los Angeles, California.

== History ==
The company was founded in [[New York City]] by [[Arthur Rankin, Jr.]] and [[Jules Bass]] on September 14, 1960, as '''Videocraft International, Ltd'''. The majority of Rankin/Bass' work, including all of their "Animagic" stop-motion productions (which they were well known for), were created in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. Throughout the 1960s, the Animagic productions were headed by Japanese stop-motion animator [[Tadahito Mochinaga]] at his studio, MOM Production. He was credited for his supervision as "Tad Mochinaga".

Rankin/Bass' traditional animation output was done by several animation studios such as [[Toei Animation]], [[Eiken (studio)|Eiken]] (formerly known as '''TCJ''', short for the '''Television Corporation of Japan'''), [[Mushi Production]], and especially [[Topcraft]], which was formed in 1971 by Toei animator Toru Hara (who was credited as an animation supervisor in some of Rankin/Bass' specials). While several of Topcraft's staff, including Hara and industry legends such as [[Hayao Miyazaki]], would go on to form [[Studio Ghibli]] in the wake of Topcraft's death, others formed another studio: Pacific Animation Corporation, which continued working on Rankin/Bass' titles until the latter company shut down.

In addition to the "name" talent that provided the narration for the specials, Rankin/Bass had its own company of voice actors. For the studio's early work, this group was based in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] where recording was supervised by veteran [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] announcer [[Bernard Cowan]]. The Canadian group included actors such as [[Paul Soles]], [[Larry D. Mann]], and [[Paul Kligman]].

[[Maury Laws]] served as musical director for almost all of the animated films and television programs. [[Romeo Muller]] was another consistent contributor, serving as screenwriter for many of Rankin/Bass' best-known productions including ''Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer'' (1964), ''The Little Drummer Boy'' (1968), and ''Frosty the Snowman'' (1969).

=== Output ===
One of Videocraft's first projects was an independently produced television series in 1960, ''[[The New Adventures of Pinocchio (TV series)|The New Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', based on the Italian author [[Carlo Collodi]]'s 1883 novel ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' and featuring "Animagic", a [[stop motion]] animation process using figurines or puppets (a process already pioneered by [[George Pal]]'s "[[Puppetoons]]" and [[Art Clokey]]'s ''[[Gumby]]'' and ''[[Davey and Goliath]]''), managed by Mochinaga and his MOM Production staffers for Videocraft with [[Dentsu]]. This was followed by another independently produced series in 1961, ''[[Tales of the Wizard of Oz]]'', Videocraft's adaptation of the 1900 novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' by [[L. Frank Baum]], as well as their first production to use traditional cel animation. Unlike many of Rankin/Bass' works, ''Tales of the Wizard of Oz'' was animated by Crawley Films in [[Ottawa]], headed by [[F. R. Crawley]].

==== ''Rudolph'' era ====
{{Main|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)}}

One of the mainstays of the business was holiday-themed animated specials for airing on American television. In 1964, the company produced a special for [[NBC]] and sponsor [[General Electric]], later owner of NBC. It was a stop motion animated adaptation of [[Robert L. May]]'s 1939 story "[[Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer]]" and the 1949 song it inspired, "[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (song)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]", written by May's brother-in-law, [[Johnny Marks]]. In 1948, it had been made into a cartoon by [[Max Fleischer]], brother and former partner of [[Dave Fleischer]], as a traditional cel animated short for the Jam Handy Film Company almost two decades earlier. This featured the Canadian actress [[Billie Mae Richards]] as the voice of the main title character, Rudolph.

With the American actor [[Burl Ives]] in the role of Sam the Snowman — the narrator, and an original orchestral score composed by Marks himself, ''Rudolph'' became one of the most popular, and longest-running [[Christmas]] specials in television history: it remained with [[NBC]] until around 1972 when it moved to [[CBS]]. In 2019, for its 55th anniversary, the special was also aired on Freeform as part of its "[[25 Days of Christmas]]" franchise, although it will continue to air on [[CBS]] under a separate license with Universal.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://enchantedworldofrankinbass.blogspot.com/2019/05/freeform-to-show-rudolph-and-frosty.html?m=1 |publisher=Rick Goldschmidt |work=Enchanted World of Rankin/Bass blog |title=FREEFORM to show Rudolph and Frosty this Holiday Season |date=May 17, 2019 |access-date=May 28, 2019}}</ref>

The special contained seven original songs. In 1965, a new song was filmed in "Animagic" to replace "We're a Couple of Misfits", titled "Fame and Fortune".

The success of ''Rudolph'' led to numerous other Christmas specials. The first was ''[[The Cricket on the Hearth#Adaptations|The Cricket on the Hearth]]'', with two live-action announcements by [[Danny Thomas]], the continuity and character designs by Don Duga and [[Paul Coker|Paul Coker, Jr.]], and the animation by Jiro Yanase's [[Eiken (studio)|TCJ]], in 1967, followed by the [[Thanksgiving]] special ''[[The Mouse on the Mayflower]]'', told by [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]] and animated by [[Kenzo Masaoka]], Sanae Yamamoto, and Yasuji Murata's [[Toei Animation]], in 1968.

==== Other holiday specials ====
Many of their other specials, like ''Rudolph'', were based on popular Christmas songs. In 1968, the British-American actress [[Greer Garson]] provided dramatic narration for ''[[The Little Drummer Boy (film)|The Little Drummer Boy]]'', based on [[The Little Drummer Boy|the traditional song]] and set during the birth of the baby [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]], and starring the [[Puerto Rica|Puerto Rican]] actor [[José Ferrer]] as the voice of Ben Haramend. During that year, Videocraft International, Ltd. (whose logo dominated the Rankin/Bass logo in the closing credit sequences) changed its name to Rankin/Bass Productions, Inc., and adopted a new logo, retaining a Videocraft byline in their closing credits until 1971 when Tomorrow Entertainment, a unit of the General Electric Company, acquired the production company. The "Animagic" process for ''The Little Drummer Boy'' took place at MOM Production, which was renamed Video Tokyo Production after Tadahito Mochinaga left Japan for his return trip to China following the completion of the animation for ''[[Mad Monster Party?]]'', thus ending his collaboration with Rankin/Bass. Takeo Nakamura, the director of [[Sanrio]]'s 1979 stop motion feature ''[[Nutcracker Fantasy]]'',<ref>[https://vimeo.com/147187551 Lost & Found Film Club: NUTCRACKER FANTASY on Vimeo]</ref><ref>[https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-12-05/sanrio-stop-motion-nutcracker-fantasy-to-be-screened-in-l.a "Saniro's Stop-Motion Nutcracker Fantasy to be Screened in LA"]. [[Anime News Network]].</ref> was among the "Animagic" team, but he was never credited as a supervisor.

The following year, in 1969, [[Jimmy Durante]] sang and told the story of ''[[Frosty the Snowman (TV special)|Frosty the Snowman]]'', with [[Jackie Vernon (comedian)|Jackie Vernon]] voicing Frosty.<ref>[https://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/the-rankin-bass-frosty-specials-on-records/ "The Rankin/Bass 'Frosty' Specials on Records"]. Cartoon Research.</ref> It was based on [[Steve Nelson (songwriter)|Steve Nelson]] and [[Walter E. "Jack" Rollins|Jack Rollins]]' 1950 song [[Frosty the Snowman|of the same name]], and also introduced [[Billy De Wolfe]] as the voice of Professor Hinkle, a greedy magician who tries to steal away the magic hat that brought Frosty to life to become a billionaire. [[Mushi Production]], an animation studio founded in 1961 and formerly led by the manga artist [[Osamu Tezuka]] (creator of ''[[Astro Boy]]'', ''[[Kimba the White Lion]]'' and ''[[Ambassador Magma]]''), handled the animation for the special with supervision by Yusaku "Steve" Nakagawa, a layout artist and character designer from [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]] in Los Angeles, California.

The year 1970 brought another Christmas special, ''[[Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town (film)|Santa Claus is Comin' To Town]]''.<ref>[https://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/rankinbass-santa-claus-is-comin-to-town-on-records/ "Rankin/Bass 'Santa Claus is Comin' to Town' on Records"]. Cartoon Research.</ref> Rankin/Bass enlisted [[Fred Astaire]] as narrator S.D. (Special Delivery) Kluger, a mailman answering children's questions about [[Santa Claus]] and telling his [[origin story]]. The story involved young Kris Kringle, voiced by [[Mickey Rooney]], and the villainous Burgermeister Meisterburger, voiced by [[Paul Frees]]. Kringle later marries the town's schoolteacher, Miss Jessica, voiced by [[Robie Lester]]. Kizo Nagashima, the associate director of Rankin/Bass' previous productions, was credited as a production supervisor.

In 1971, Rankin/Bass produced their first [[Easter]] television special, ''[[Here Comes Peter Cottontail]]'', with the voices of [[Danny Kaye]] as the narrator Seymour S. Sassafrass, [[Vincent Price]] as the evil rabbit January Q. Irontail, and [[Casey Kasem]] from Hanna-Barbera's ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' franchise as the title character Peter Cottontail. It was not based upon [[Peter Cottontail (song)|the title song]] by Steve Nelson and Jack Rollins, but on a 1957 novel by Priscilla and Otto Friedrich titled ''The Easter Bunny That Overslept''. This was the second and final "Animagic" production to be supervised by Kizo Nagashima. Steve Nakagawa was also involved in this special as a continuity designer. In 1977, Fred Astaire returned as S. D. Kluger in ''[[The Easter Bunny Is Comin' to Town]]'', telling the tale of the [[Easter Bunny]]'s origins. From there, Rankin/Bass used Masaki Iizuka as an associate producer, and Akikazu Kono as an "Animagic" supervisor. Back in 1973, Iizuka was the production assistant of ''[[Marco (film)|Marco]]'' — a live-action musical film based on the biography of Italian merchant, explorer, and writer [[Marco Polo]], filmed at [[Toho Company]] in Tokyo and on location throughout East Asia, and featuring Kono's "Animagic" sequence of the Tree People. Previously, he was met by Rankin during the animation production of the Halloween television special ''[[Mad, Mad, Mad Monsters]]'' at Mushi Production in 1972, and became an integral part of Rankin/Bass for many years.

In 1974, Rankin/Bass Productions was relaunched once again as an independent production company and produced another Christmas special for television, ''[[The Year Without a Santa Claus]]'', featuring [[Shirley Booth]], voicing narrator Mrs. Claus; Mickey Rooney, returning as the voice of Santa Claus; and supporting characters [[Snow Miser]] (voiced by [[Dick Shawn]]) and [[Heat Miser]] (voiced by [[George S. Irving]]). It was the first Rankin/Bass "Animagic" production on which Akikazu Kono and puppet maker Ichiro Komuro share in the production supervision. It was [[The Year Without a Santa Claus (2006 film)|remade]] as a poorly received [[live action|live-action]]/[[special effects]] TV movie shown on [[NBC]] in 2006 starring [[Delta Burke]] and [[John Goodman]] as Mrs. Claus and Santa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0828465/|title=The Year Without a Santa Claus|date=11 December 2006|access-date=17 March 2018|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>

Throughout the 1970s, Rankin/Bass, with Video Tokyo and the former Toei Animation employee Toru Hara's [[Topcraft]], continued to produce animated sequels to its classic specials, including the teaming of Rudolph and Frosty in 1979's ''[[Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July]],'' with the voice of [[Ethel Merman]] as Lilly Loraine, the [[ringmaster (circus)|ringmistress]] of a seaside [[circus]], and Rooney again returning as Santa. The special features cameos by characters from several other Rankin/Bass holiday specials, including Big Ben the Clockwork Whale from ''[[Rudolph's Shiny New Year]]'' and [[Jack Frost]] from ''[[Frosty's Winter Wonderland]]''. Later that year, Jack appeared in his own special, ''[[Jack Frost (1979 film)|Jack Frost]]''. Narrated by [[Buddy Hackett]], it tells the story of the winter sprite's love for a mortal woman menaced by the evil [[Cossack]] king, Kubla Kraus (Paul Frees, in addition to Kubla, voiced Jack Frost's overlord, Father Winter). In this special, Jack's voice was performed by [[Robert Morse]], who previously voiced Stuffy in 1976's ''[[The First Easter Rabbit]]'' (loosely based on Margery Williams' ''[[The Velveteen Rabbit]]''), and young [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] in 1978's ''[[The Stingiest Man in Town]]'' (based on Charles Dickens' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'').

Among Rankin/Bass' original specials was 1975's ''[[The First Christmas: The Story of the First Christmas Snow]]'', featuring the voice of [[Angela Lansbury]] (who also starred in the 1982 adaptation of ''[[The Last Unicorn]]'') as the narrating and singing nun, Sister Theresa, and [[Irving Berlin]]'s Christmas classic "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]".

Their final stop-motion style Christmas story was ''[[The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus (TV special)|The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus]]'', taken from the L. Frank Baum story [[The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus|of the same name]] and released in 1985. In this story, the Great Ak (voiced by Alfred Drake) summons a council of the Immortals to bestow upon a dying Claus (voiced by [[Earl Hammond]], with [[J.D. Roth]] voicing the young Claus) the Mantle of Immortality. To make his case, the Great Ak tells Claus's life story, from his discovery as a foundling in the magical forest and his raising by Immortals, through his education by the Great Ak in the harsh realities of the human world, and his acceptance of his destiny to struggle to bring joy to children.<ref>{{IMDb title|0089488|The Life & Adventures of Santa Claus (1985)}}</ref> This special has recently been released as part of [[Warner Bros. Home Entertainment]]'s [[Warner Archive Collection]], on a double-feature disc that also contains ''[[Nestor the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey]]'' which is often paired with ''The First Christmas'' on holiday broadcasts.

Many of these specials are still shown seasonally on American television, and some have been released on VHS, Betamax, LaserDisc, DVD, Blu-ray, and Digital.

==== Non-holiday output ====
Throughout the 1960s, Videocraft produced other [[stop motion]] and [[traditional animation]] specials and films, some of which were non-holiday stories. 1965 saw the production of Rankin/Bass' first theatrical film, ''[[Willy McBean and His Magic Machine]]'', another joint venture between Videocraft and Dentsu. 1966 brought ''[[The Daydreamer (film)|The Daydreamer]]'', the first of three films to be produced in association with executive producer [[Joseph E. Levine]]'s [[Embassy Pictures]] in Los Angeles, California, and the film adaptation of the stories and characters by the Danish author [[Hans Christian Andersen]], which combines live-action, special effects and "Animagic"; and ''[[The Ballad of Smokey the Bear]]'', the story of the famous forest fire-fighting bear seen in numerous public service announcements, narrated by [[James Cagney]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Animated TV Specials: The Complete Directory to the First Twenty-Five Years, 1962-1987 |date=1989 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-2198-2 |access-date=27 March 2020 |url=https://archive.org/details/animatedtvspecia0000wool |url-access=registration |pages=[https://archive.org/details/animatedtvspecia0000wool/page/24 24]-25}}</ref>

The theatrical feature film ''[[Mad Monster Party?]]'' saw theatrical release in the spring of 1967, featuring one of the last performances by the British actor [[Boris Karloff]]. The film features affectionate send-ups of classic movie monsters and their locales, adding "Beatle"-wigged skeletons as a send-up of the era's pop bands, and a writing staff borrowed from ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine, including the cartoonist [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]], who designed the characters of this film. It is also the last "Animagic" project that Tadahito Mochinaga supervised.

In 1972 and 1973, Rankin/Bass produced four animated TV movies for ''[[The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie]]'' series: ''[[Mad Mad Mad Monsters]]'' (with the animation by Mushi), ''[[Willie Mays and the Say-Hey Kid]]'', ''The Red Baron'', and ''[[That Girl#Spin-offs|That Girl in Wonderland]]'' (all featuring the animation by Topcraft).

In 1977, Rankin/Bass produced an animated version of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]''. It was followed in 1980 by an animated version of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]'' (the animation rights to the first two volumes were held by [[Saul Zaentz]], producer of [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s animated adaptation ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''). Other books adapted include ''[[The Last Unicorn]]'' by [[Peter S. Beagle]], a rare theatrical release that was co-produced with [[ITC Entertainment]] in London, England, [[Peter Dickinson]]'s ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]'' and [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s ''[[The Wind in the Willows (1987 film)|The Wind in the Willows]]'' which was animated by the second overseas animation unit of Hanna-Barbera, James Wang's Cuckoo's Nest Studios (now [[Wang Film Productions]]) in Taipei, Taiwan.

In addition to their prime time specials, Rankin/Bass produced several regular television shows in traditional animation, including ''[[The King Kong Show]]'' in 1966, co-produced with [[Toei Animation]], ''[[The Tomfoolery Show]]'' in 1970, ''[[The Jackson 5ive (TV series)|The Jackson 5ive]]'' in 1971 (the latter co-produced with [[Motown Productions]]), and ''[[Kid Power]]'' and ''[[The Osmonds]]'' in 1972. The most successful of these was [[Tobin Wolf|Ted Wolf]]'s ''[[ThunderCats (1985 TV series)|ThunderCats]]'' in 1985, an action-adventure series based on his related line of toys. It was followed by two similar TV shows about humanoid animals, ''[[SilverHawks]]'' in 1986, and ''[[TigerSharks]]'', as part of the series ''[[The Comic Strip (TV series)|The Comic Strip]]'' in 1987. Each of those four series was mainly animated by former Topcraft employees' Pacific Animation Corporation, with production management by Masaki Iizuka, just before the studio was bought by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] and renamed [[List of animation studios owned by The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Animation Japan]] in 1988. Neither one enjoyed the same commercial success as ''ThunderCats'' did, however.

Rankin/Bass also attempted live-action productions, such as 1967's ''[[King Kong Escapes]]'', a co-production with [[Toho]]; 1976's ''[[The Last Dinosaur]]''; 1978's ''[[The Bermuda Depths]]''; 1980's ''[[The Ivory Ape]]'' (all co-produced with [[Tsuburaya Productions]], the creators of the ''[[Ultra Series]]''); and 1983's ''The Sins of Dorian Gray''. With the exception of ''King Kong Escapes'', all were made-for-television films.

=== Demise ===
After its last series output, Rankin/Bass shut down its production company on March 4, 1987.

Arthur Rankin, Jr. would split his time between New York City, where the company still has its offices, and his home in [[Bermuda]]. Rankin died at [[Harrington Sound, Bermuda]] on January 30, 2014 at the age of 89.<ref>[http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20140131/NEWS/140139945 Obituary for Arthur Rankin, Jr.] from ''The Royal Gazette'', 1/31/2014</ref> Bass became a [[vegetarian]]; a decade later, he wrote ''Herb, the Vegetarian Dragon'',<ref>''Herb, the Vegetarian Dragon'', 1999, {{ISBN|978-1-902283-36-4}}</ref> the first children's book character developed specifically to explore moral issues related to vegetarianism. The original story and a follow-up cookbook became bestsellers for independent publishing house [[Barefoot Books]].

In 1999, Rankin/Bass joined forces with James G. Robinson's [[Morgan Creek Entertainment|Morgan Creek Productions]] and [[Nest Family Entertainment]] (creators of ''[[The Swan Princess]]'' franchise) for the first and only [[The King and I (1999 film)|animated adaptation]] of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s musical ''[[The King and I]]'', based on a treatment by Rankin. Distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] with its [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]] division, the film flopped at the American box office and many American film critics took it to task for its depictions of "offensive ethnic stereotyping."

In 2001, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] aired the first new original Christmas special to be produced by both Rankin and Bass in 16 years, ''Santa, Baby!'', which like most of their production company's other specials was based on a [[Santa Baby|popular, similarly-titled Christmas song]]. ''Santa, Baby!'' stood out from its predecessors due to its use of [[African-American]] characters and voice performers, such as [[Patti LaBelle]] (the narrator), [[Eartha Kitt]], [[Gregory Hines]], [[Vanessa L. Williams]] and [[Tom Joyner]].<ref>{{IMDb title|0358103|Santa Baby! (2001)}}</ref> Although Pacific Animation Corporation was responsible for the overseas animation production of the special with the background art provided by Atelier BWCA and the See Throu Studio, some of the animation services were done at Steven Hahn's [[Hanho Heung-Up]] in Seoul, South Korea. ''Santa, Baby!'' turned out to be the final Rankin/Bass-produced special; the Rankin/Bass partnership was officially dissolved shortly after, with most of its remaining assets acquired by [[Warner Bros. Entertainment]].

Currently, the pre-1974 Rankin/Bass library (including works from Videocraft International) is owned by [[NBCUniversal]] via [[DreamWorks Animation]]'s [[DreamWorks Classics]] subsidiary, while Warner Bros. owns the rights to the post-1973 library via Telepictures. NBCUniversal also retained the rights to ''King Kong Escapes'' and also currently holds the rights to ''Willy McBean and his Magic Machine'', again, via DreamWorks Classics. [[StudioCanal]] holds the rights to the films from Rankin/Bass that Embassy Pictures distributed, while [[ITV Studios]] currently holds the rights to ''The Last Unicorn''. The rights to the 1999 animated film adaptation of ''The King and I'' are currently held by Morgan Creek Entertainment.

== Legacy ==
For over 20 years, most of Rankin/Bass' films were shown on [[Freeform (TV channel)|the Family Channel and Freeform]] during their December "[[25 Days of Christmas]]" seasonal period. Starting in 2018, the specials moved to [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] and aired during their "Best Christmas Ever" seasonal period. The original ''Rudolph'' and ''Frosty'' specials currently air on [[CBS]] under a separate contract with Rankin/Bass and its successors-in-interest. The two specials also air on [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]]. The look and style of the films heavily influences more modern holiday classics such as ''[[Elf (film)|Elf]]'' (2003).

The specials of Rankin/Bass have been parodied by the likes of TV series from ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''<ref>[https://vimeo.com/40118476 Saturday Night Live (SNL): “The Narrator That Ruined Christmas” on Vimeo]</ref> to ''[[South Park]]'',<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0705892/movieconnections/?tab=mc&ref_=tt_trv_cnn "South Park" A Very Crappy Christmas (TV Episode 2000) - Connections - IMDB]</ref> while non-holiday works like ''The Last Unicorn'' maintained a [[Cult film|cult following]].<ref>[https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2468792/18-popular-cult-classic-movies-that-are-perfect-for-movie-night 18 Popular Cult Classic Movies That Are Perfect For Movie Night  - CINEMABLEND]</ref>
