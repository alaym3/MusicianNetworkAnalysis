== Career ==

=== Music career ===

In 1985, Isaak signed a contract with [[Warner Bros. Records]] and released his first album, ''[[Silvertone (album)|Silvertone]]'',<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> to critical acclaim, including from [[John Fogerty]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/chris-isaak-285948#big-break |title=Chris Isaak bio |website=[[Biography.com]] |access-date=November 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404224546/https://www.biography.com/people/chris-isaak-285948#big-break |archive-date=April 4, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The name was taken from the band he formed after graduating college; a reference to the Silvertone guitar brand popularized during the 1950s. The album's sound was raw and diverse, mingling country blues with conventional folk ballads.<ref name="oldies1" /> Although the album was a critical success, it failed to sell respectably.<ref name="allmusic1">{{cite web|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/chris-isaak-mn0000775323/biography |title=Chris Isaak &#124; Biography & History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=June 26, 1956 |access-date=March 12, 2016|author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine }}</ref> Two tracks from the album, "Gone Ridin'" and "Livin' for Your Lover", featured in [[David Lynch]]'s 1986 film ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]''.

Isaak's [[Chris Isaak (album)|self-titled follow-up album]] was released in 1986 and managed to scrape into the [[Billboard 200]].<ref name="allmusic1" /> The album saw Isaak hone his style to sophisticated R&B.<ref name="oldies1" /> The artwork for ''Chris Isaak'' was photographed by fashion photographer [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]].

Warner Bros. moved Isaak to their [[Reprise Records]] label in 1988.

Isaak's best known song is "[[Wicked Game]]".<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> In an interview with Mark Needham, an engineer who worked with Isaak on "Wicked Game", Needham claimed that it took several years to put the track together.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.mixonline.com/recording/classic-tracks-chris-isaaks-wicked-game-365028|title = Classic Tracks: Chris Isaak's "Wicked Game"|date = May 2002|access-date = February 12, 2016|website = ProQuest|last = Droney|first = Maureen}}</ref> First released on the 1989 album ''[[Heart Shaped World (Chris Isaak album)|Heart Shaped World]]'', an [[instrumental]] version of the song was subsequently featured in the 1990 David Lynch film ''[[Wild at Heart (film)|Wild at Heart]]''.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> Lee Chesnut, an Atlanta radio station music director who was obsessed with Lynch films, played the vocal version and it became the station's most-requested song. Chesnut spread the word to other radio stations and the single became a national top 10 hit in February 1991. It also reached No. 10 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

Another less-seen version of "Wicked Game" is directed by David Lynch and comprises scenes from the film ''Wild at Heart''. "Wicked Game" featured as the backing music in the 2001 TV advertisement for the [[Jaguar X-Type]] in the UK.

"Two Hearts" from Isaak's fourth album, ''[[San Francisco Days]]'', was featured in the closing credits of ''[[True Romance]]'', a 1993 film directed by [[Tony Scott]], written by [[Quentin Tarantino]], and starring [[Christian Slater]] and [[Patricia Arquette]].

In 1995, Isaak split with longtime guitarist [[James Wilsey|James Calvin Wilsey]].

On March 15, 1996, the album was certified Platinum by the [[RIAA]]. "[[Baby Did a Bad Bad Thing]]" was featured in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s final film, ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]'', in 1999. The music video for the song was directed by Herb Ritts (his second collaboration with Isaak); it was shot in color and featured Isaak and French supermodel [[Laetitia Casta]] in a motel room.

Isaak composed a [[theme song]] for U.S. late-night television variety-talk show ''[[The Late Late Show (American talk show)#Craig Kilborn (1999–2004)|The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn]]''.

The [[record producer]] [[Erik Jacobsen]] was instrumental in Isaak's sound for 15 years. Jacobsen is known for his production work with [[The Lovin' Spoonful]], as well as on solo albums by Spoonful's [[John Sebastian]] and [[Jerry Yester]]. Isaak ceased working with Jacobsen on his 2002 album ''[[Always Got Tonight]]''. "Life Will Go On" from this album was featured in ''[[Chasing Liberty]]'', a 2004 film starring [[Mandy Moore]] and [[Matthew Goode]].

In 2007, a live performance of Isaak singing [[Fats Domino]]'s hit "[[Blueberry Hill (song)|Blueberry Hill]]" with [[Johnny Hallyday]] at [[La Cigale]] was released on Hallyday's live album ''La Cigale : 12-17 Décembre 2006''.

On September 7, 2015, it was announced that Isaak would be performing at the [[2015 AFL Grand Final]], along with English singer [[Ellie Goulding]] and Canadian musician [[Bryan Adams]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Twomey|first1=Callum|title=Adams, Goulding, Isaak headline GF show|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-09-07/bryan-adams-chris-isaak-headline-grand-final-entertainment|website=afl.com.au|publisher=Australian Football League|access-date=September 7, 2015}}</ref>

==== Guitars ====
Isaak revealed in a 2002 interview with ''Acoustic Guitar'' that he uses a one-of-a-kind [[Gibson]]:

{{blockquote|For my electric, I've got a one-off Gibson version of a [[Gretsch 6120]], a sort of [[Chet Atkins]] thing. They made one of these things and gave it to me to see if I liked it, and I liked it so much I've been playing it ever since. People told me they thought it was a White Falcon, but it's not. It's just a white Gibson. I don't think they ever manufactured any of the things. They strung up this one prototype, scratched their heads, and said, 'Huh. Give it to Isaak.'<ref name="AGC">{{cite web |title=Acoustic Guitar Central |work=What They Play: Chris Isaak |url=http://www.acousticguitar.com/issues/ag116/gear116.html#5 |access-date=April 26, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926220052/http://www.acousticguitar.com/issues/ag116/gear116.html#5 |archive-date=September 26, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>}}
