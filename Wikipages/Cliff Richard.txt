Increased focus on his Christianity and subsequent softening of his music led to a more [[Middle of the road (music)|middle-of-the-road]] image, and he sometimes ventured into [[contemporary Christian music]].

Over a career spanning 60 years, Richard has amassed several gold and platinum discs and awards, including two [[Ivor Novello]] Awards and three [[Brit Awards]].

==Biography==

===1940–1958: Childhood and adolescence===
Cliff Richard was born Harry Rodger Webb in [[British Raj|British India]] at King George's Hospital (now KGMU Hospital), Victoria Street, in [[Lucknow]], which was then part of [[British India]]. His parents were Rodger Oscar Webb, a manager for a catering contractor that serviced the [[Indian Railways]], and the former Dorothy Marie Dazely. His parents also spent some years in Howrah, West Bengal. After the violence of [[Direct Action Day]], they decided to shift to England permanently.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}} Richard is primarily of English heritage, but he had one great-grandmother who was of half Welsh and half Spanish descent, born of a Spanish great-great-grandmother named Emiline Joseph Rebeiro.<ref>{{cite book |last=Turner |first=Steve |author-link=Steve Turner (writer) |title=Cliff Richard: The Biography |year=2008 |publisher=Lion |location=Oxford |isbn=9780745952796 |page=21 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=He0S6tFOGPUC&pg=PA21}}</ref>

The Webb family lived in a modest home in [[Maqbara]], near the main shopping centre of [[Hazratganj]].<ref name="ReferenceA">Stark, Herbert Alick. Hostages To India: OR The Life Story of the Anglo Indian Race, London: The Simon Wallenberg Press: Vol 2: Anglo Indian Heritage Books</ref> Dorothy's mother served as the dormitory matron at the [[La Martiniere Lucknow|La Martiniere Girls' School]]. Richard has three sisters, Joan, Jacqui and Donna (1942–2016).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/sir-cliff-richard-s-sister-donna-goulden-dies-age-73-after-long-illness-a3315451.html|title=Sir Cliff Richard's sister Donna Goulden dies age 73|access-date=13 April 2018|date=9 August 2016}}</ref><ref>When Piers Met Sir Cliff, [[ITV1]]</ref>

In 1948, following [[Partition of India|Indian independence]], the family embarked on a three-week sea voyage to [[Tilbury]], Essex, England aboard the {{SS|Ranchi}}. The Webbs moved from comparative wealth in India, where they lived in a company-supplied flat at [[Howrah]] near [[Calcutta]], to a [[semi-detached]] house in [[Carshalton]]. Harry Webb attended a local primary school, Stanley Park Juniors, in Carshalton, north [[Surrey]]. In 1949, his father obtained employment in the credit control office of [[Thorn Electrical Industries]] and the family moved in with other relatives in [[Waltham Cross]], [[Hertfordshire]], where he attended Kings Road Junior Mixed Infants School, until a three-bedroom council house in nearby [[Cheshunt]] was allocated to them in 1950, at 12 Hargreaves Close.

He then attended Cheshunt Secondary Modern School from 1952 to 1957. (The school was later renamed Riversmead School before being rebuilt and renamed [[Cheshunt School|Bishopslea School]].) As a member of the top stream, he stayed on beyond the minimum leaving age to take [[GCE Ordinary Level]] examinations and gained a pass in [[English literature]]. He then started work as a filing clerk for Atlas Lamps.<ref name=MyLifeMyWay>{{Cite book |year=2008 |author=Cliff Richard; Penny Junor |isbn=978-0-7553-1588-8 |title=My Life, My Way |publisher=Headline Publishing Group |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mylifemyway0000rich }}</ref> A development of retirement flats, Cliff Richard Court, has been named after him in Cheshunt.<ref>{{cite web|author=Cliff Richard Court |url=http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=cliff+richard+cheshunt&sll=53.800651,-4.064941&sspn=7.50299,28.256836&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Cliff+Richard+Court,+High+St,+Cheshunt,+Waltham+Cross,+Hertfordshire+EN8+0BE,+United+Kingdom&t=h&z=15 |title=Google maps |publisher=Google Maps |date=1 January 1970 |access-date=29 January 2012}}</ref>

Harry Webb became interested in [[skiffle]]. When he was 16, his father bought him a guitar, and in 1957, he formed the school vocal harmony group The Quintones,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QQaEe66cmHYC&pg=PA35 |title=Cliff: An Intimate Portrait of a Living Legend |first1=Stafford |last1=Hildred |first2=Tim |last2=Ewbank |date=13 April 2010 |publisher=Random House |access-date=27 November 2018 |via=Google Books|isbn=9780753536100 }}</ref> before singing in the Dick Teague Skiffle Group.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a355023/ten-things-about-cliff-richard.html |title=Ten Things About...

===1958–1963: Success and stardom===
[[File:Cliff Richard persconferentie op Schiphol, Bestanddeelnr 913-7393.jpg|thumb|upright|Richard at a press conference in the Netherlands in 1962]]
Harry Webb became lead singer of a [[rock and roll]] group, the Drifters (distinct from [[The Drifters|the US group of the same name]]). The 1950s entrepreneur Harry Greatorex wanted the up-and-coming rock 'n' roll singer to [[Name change#United Kingdom|change his name]]. The name ''Cliff'' was adopted as it sounded like "cliff face", which suggested "Rock". It was "[[Move It]]" writer [[Ian Samwell]] who suggested the surname "Richard" as a tribute to Webb's musical hero [[Little Richard]].<ref name="contactmusic.com"/>

Before their first large-scale appearance, at the Regal Ballroom in [[Ripley, Derbyshire]] in 1958, they adopted the name "Cliff Richard and the Drifters". The four members were Harry Webb (by then going under the stage name "Cliff Richard"), Ian Samwell on guitar, Terry Smart on drums and Norman Mitham on guitar. None of the other three played with the later and better known [[The Shadows|Shadows]], although Samwell wrote songs for Richard's later career.  Agent [[George Ganjou]] saw the group perform in London, and recommended them to [[Norrie Paramor]] for an audition.<ref name=baker>Richard Anthony Baker, ''Old Time Variety: an illustrated history'', Pen & Sword, 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-78340-066-9}}, p.208</ref>

For Richard's debut session, Paramor provided him with "Schoolboy Crush", a song previously recorded by American [[Bobby Helms]]. Richard was permitted to record one of his own songs for the [[B-side]]; this was "Move It", written and composed by the Drifters' Samwell while he was on board a number 715 [[Green Line Coaches|Green Line]] bus on the way to Richard's house for a rehearsal. For the "Move It" session, Paramor used the session guitarist Ernie Shears on lead guitar and Frank Clark on bass.

There are various stories about why the A-side was replaced by the intended B-side. One is that Norrie Paramor's young daughter raved about the B-side; another was that influential TV producer [[Jack Good (producer)|Jack Good]], who used the act <!--another word needed for the act?-->for his TV show ''[[Oh Boy! (TV series)|Oh Boy!]]'', wanted the only song on his show to be "Move It" as opposed to "Schoolboy Crush".<ref>Richard himself stated that the latter theory is correct; interviewed for the first episode of the [[BBC Four]] programme, ''Pop Britannia'', broadcast on 4 January 2008.</ref> Richard was quoted as saying:
{{quote|It's wonderful to be going on TV for the first time, but I feel so nervous that I don't know what to do. I shaved my sideburns off last night...

[[File:Cliff Richard aankomst met zijn Shadows, Bestanddeelnr 913-7397.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Richard with [[the Shadows]] in 1962]]The single went to No. 2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. [[John Lennon]] credited "Move It" as being the first British rock record.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lazarevic |first=Jade |url=http://www.theherald.com.au/story/335682/cliff-richard-has-no-time-to-stop/ |title=Cliff Richard has no time to stop |publisher=Theherald.com.au |date=15 September 2012 |access-date=7 January 2013}}</ref>

In the early days, Richard was marketed as the British equivalent of Elvis. Like previous British rockers such as [[Tommy Steele]] and [[Marty Wilde]], Richard adopted Elvis-like dress and hairstyle. In performance he struck a pose of rock attitude, rarely smiling or looking at the audience or camera. His late 1958 and early 1959 follow-up singles, "[[High Class Baby]]" and "[[Livin' Lovin' Doll]]", were followed by "[[Mean Streak (song)|Mean Streak]]", which carried a rocker's sense of speed and passion, and [[Lionel Bart]]'s "[[Living Doll (song)|Living Doll]]".

It was on "Living Doll" that the Drifters began to back Richard on record. It was his fifth record and became his first No. 1 single. By that time, the group's line-up had changed with the arrival of [[Jet Harris]], [[Tony Meehan]], [[Hank Marvin]] and [[Bruce Welch]]. The group was obliged to change its name to "The Shadows" after legal complications with the American group [[the Drifters]] as "Living Doll" entered the American top 40, licensed by [[ABC-Paramount]]. "Living Doll" was used in Richard's début film ''[[Serious Charge]]'', but it was arranged as a country standard, rather than a rock and roll standard.

The Shadows were not a typical backing group. They became contractually separate from Richard, and the group received no royalties for records backing Richard. In 1959, the Shadows (then still the Drifters) landed an [[EMI]] recording contract of their own, for independent recordings. That year, they released three singles, two of which featured double-sided vocals and one of which had instrumental A and B sides. They thereafter had several major hits, including five UK No. 1s. The band also continued to appear and record with Richard and wrote many of his hits. On more than one occasion, a Shadows instrumental replaced a Richard song at the top of the British charts.

Richard's fifth single "Living Doll" triggered a softer, more relaxed, sound. Subsequent hits, the No. 1s "[[Travellin' Light]]" and "[[I Love You (Cliff Richard song)|I Love You]]" and also "[[A Voice in the Wilderness (song)|A Voice in the Wilderness]]", lifted from his film ''[[Expresso Bongo]]'', and "[[Theme for a Dream]]" cemented Richard's status as a mainstream pop entertainer along with contemporaries such as [[Adam Faith]] and [[Billy Fury]]. Throughout the early 1960s, his hits were consistently in the top five.

[[File:Princess Margaret meets Cliff Richard at the 59 Club, 1962. (7936244214).jpg|thumb|right|[[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]] (left) and Richard at the [[59 Club]], London in 1962]]
In 1961, EMI records organised Richard's 21st birthday party at its London headquarters in Manchester Square led by his producer Norrie Paramor. Photographs of the celebrations were incorporated into Richard's next album "21 Today" in which Tony Meehan joined in despite, then, having very recently left the Shadows to be replaced by Brian Bennett.

Typically, the Shadows closed the first half of the show with a 30-minute set of their own, then backed Richard on his show-closing 45-minute stint as exemplified by the retrospective CD album release of ''Live at the ABC Kingston 1962''. Tony Meehan and Jet Harris left the group in 1961 and 1962 respectively and later had their own chart successes for [[Decca Records|Decca]]. The Shadows added bass players [[Brian Locking]] (1962–63) and then [[John Rostill]] (1963–68) and took on [[Brian Bennett (musician)|Brian Bennett]] permanently on drums.

In the early years, particularly on album and EP releases, Richard also recorded ballads backed by the Norrie Paramor Orchestra with Tony Meehan (and later Brian Bennett) as a session drummer. His first such single without the Shadows was [[When the Girl in Your Arms Is the Girl in Your Heart]] in 1961, and he continued to release one or two per year, including covers of "[[It's All in the Game (song)|It's All in the Game]]" in 1963 and "[[L'Edera (song)|Constantly]]" in 1964, a revival of a popular Italian hit. In 1965, sessions under the direction of [[Billy Sherrill]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] were particularly successful, yielding "[[The Minute You're Gone]]", which topped the UK singles chart and "Wind Me Up (Let Me Go)" which made No. 2.

Richard, and the Shadows in particular, however, never achieved star status in the United States. In 1960 they toured the United States and were well-received, but lacklustre support and distribution from a revolving door of American record labels proved an obstacle to long-term success there despite several chart records by Richard including the aforementioned "It's All in the Game" on Epic, via a renewed linking of the worldwide Columbia labels after Philips ended its distribution deal with CBS. To the Shadows' chagrin, "[[Apache (single)|Apache]]" reached No. 2 in the US through a cover version by Danish guitarist [[Jorgen Ingmann]] which was almost unchanged from their worldwide hit. Richard and the band appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', which was crucial for the Beatles, but these performances did not help them gain sustained success in North America.

Richard and the Shadows appeared in six feature films including a debut in the 1959 film ''[[Serious Charge]]'' but most notably in ''[[The Young Ones (1961 film)|The Young Ones]]'', ''[[Summer Holiday (1963 film)|Summer Holiday]]'', ''[[Wonderful Life (1964 film)|Wonderful Life]]'', and ''[[Finders Keepers (1966 film)|Finders Keepers]]''. These films created their own genre, known as the "Cliff Richard musical", and led to Richard being named the No. 1 cinema box office attraction in Britain for both 1962 and 1963, beating that of even James Bond.<ref>'Top Box Office Stars of 1962, ''Motion Picture Herald'' 1962</ref> The [[The Young Ones (song)|title song]] of ''The Young Ones'' became his biggest-selling single in the United Kingdom, selling over one million copies in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-uk-s-million-selling-singles__6907/ |title=Official Charts &#124; The UK's million selling singles |publisher=Official Charts |access-date=29 December 2015}}</ref> The irreverent 1980s TV [[British sitcom|sitcom]] ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'' took its name from Richard's 1962 film. In mid-1963, Cliff and the Shadows appeared for a season in [[Blackpool]], where Richard had his portrait modelled by Victor Heyfron.

===1964–1975: Changing circumstances===
As with the other existing rock acts in Britain, Richard's career was affected by the advent of the Beatles and the [[Beat music|Mersey sound]] in 1963 and 1964. He continued to be popular, and have hits in the charts throughout the 1960s, though not at the level that he had enjoyed before. Nor did doors open to him in the US market; he was not considered part of the [[British Invasion]], and despite four Hot 100 hits (including the top 25 "It's All in the Game") between August 1963 and August 1964, the American public had little awareness of him.

Richard's 1965 UK No. 12 hit "On My Word" ended a run of 23 consecutive top ten UK hits between "A Voice in the Wilderness" in 1960 to "The Minute You're Gone" in 1965, which, to date, is still a record number of consecutive top ten UK hits for a male artist.<ref name="everyHit.com"/> Richard continued having international hits, including 1967's "The Day I Met Marie", which reached No. 10 in the UK Singles Chart and No. 5 in the [[ARIA Charts|Australian]] charts.

Although [[Baptism|baptised]] as an [[Anglican]], Richard did not practise the faith in his early years. In 1964, he became an active Christian and his faith has become an important aspect of his life. Standing up publicly as a Christian affected his career in several ways. Initially, he believed that he should quit rock 'n' roll, feeling he could no longer be the rocker who had been called a "crude exhibitionist" and "too sexy for TV". Richard intended at first to "reform his ways" and become a teacher, but Christian friends advised him not to abandon his career just because he had become an active Christian. Soon after, Richard re-emerged, performing with Christian groups and recording some Christian material. He still recorded secular songs with the Shadows, but devoted a lot of his time to Christian work, including appearances with the [[Billy Graham (evangelist)|Billy Graham]] crusades. As time progressed, Richard balanced his faith and work, enabling him to remain one of the most popular singers in Britain as well as one of its best-known Christians.

Richard acted in the 1967 film ''[[Two a Penny]]'', released by Billy Graham's [[World Wide Pictures]],<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0140642/ Two a Penny (1967) IMDB.com] <!--Retrieved 22 September 2008--></ref> in which he played Jamie Hopkins, a young man who gets involved in [[drug dealing]] while questioning his life after his girlfriend changes her attitude. He released the live album ''Cliff in Japan'' in 1967.

In 1968, he sang the UK's entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], "[[Congratulations (Cliff Richard song)|Congratulations]]", written and composed by [[Bill Martin (musician)|Bill Martin]] and [[Phil Coulter]]; it lost, however, by one point to Spain's "[[La, la, la|La La La]]". According to [[John Kennedy O'Connor]]'s ''The Eurovision Song Contest—The Official History'', this was the closest result yet in the contest and Richard locked himself in the toilet to avoid the nerves of the voting.<ref>O'Connor, John Kennedy. Richard says: Spain is the best of Eurovision Song Contest.</ref> In May 2008, a [[Reuters]] news report claimed that voting in the competition had been fixed by the Spanish dictator leader, [[Francisco Franco]], to ensure that the Spanish entry won, allowing them to host the contest the following year (1969). It is claimed that Spanish [[Televisión Española|TVE]] television executives offered to buy programmes in exchange for votes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUKL0556354420080505 |title=Reuters |date= 5 May 2008|access-date=29 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Govan |first=Fiona |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/1926993/How-Franco-cheated-Cliff-of-victory-in-Eurovision.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120527033110/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/1926993/How-Franco-cheated-Cliff-of-victory-in-Eurovision.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 May 2012 |title=How Franco cheated Cliff out of Eurovision title |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=4 May 2008 |access-date=29 January 2012}}</ref> The story was widely covered and featured on UK's ''[[Channel 4 News]]'' as a main story on 7 May 2008, with [[Jon Snow (journalist)|Jon Snow]] interviewing author and historian [[John Kennedy O'Connor]] about the matter.<ref>{{cite web|author=JKMMOC |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiF3Ylj6oRM&feature=channel_page |title=EUROVISION CHANNEL 4 NEWS May 7, 2008 |via=YouTube |access-date=10 December 2011}}</ref> Eurovision later ended voting by national juries in a bid to eradicate such alleged scams. Nevertheless, "Congratulations" was a huge hit throughout Europe and Australia, and yet another No. 1 in April 1968.[[Image:Sir Cliff Richard Allan Warren.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Portrait of Richard by [[Allan Warren]] (1973)]]After the Shadows split in 1968, Richard continued to record. During the 1970s, Richard took part in several television shows and fronted his own show ''It's Cliff Richard'' from 1970 to 1976. It starred [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Hank Marvin]] and [[Una Stubbs]], and included ''A Song for Europe''. He began 1970 by appearing live on the [[BBC]]'s review of the sixties music scene, ''[[Pop Go The Sixties]]'', which was broadcast across Britain and Europe on 31 December 1969. He performed "Bachelor Boy" with the Shadows and "Congratulations" solo. In 1972, he made a short BBC television comedy film called ''The Case'' with appearances from comedians and his first ever duets with a woman—Newton-John. He went on to release a double live album, ''Cliff Live in Japan 1972'', which featured Newton-John.

His final acting role on the silver screen to date was in 1973, when he starred in the film ''[[Take Me High]]''.

In 1973, he sang the British Eurovision entry "[[Power to All Our Friends]];" the song finished third, close behind Luxembourg's "[[Tu Te Reconnaîtras]]" and Spain's "[[Eres Tú (Mocedades song)|Eres Tú]]." This time, Richard took [[Diazepam|Valium]] to overcome his nerves and his manager was almost unable to wake him for the performance.<ref>O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History. Carlton Books, UK. 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-84442-994-3}}</ref> Richard also hosted the BBC's qualifying heat for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], ''[[A Song for Europe]],'' in 1970, 1971 and 1972 as part of his BBCTV variety series. He presented the [[Eurovision Song Contest Previews]] for the BBC in 1971 and 1972.

In 1975, he released the single "[[Honky Tonk Angel (Cliff Richard song)|Honky Tonk Angel]]", produced by Hank Marvin and John Farrar, oblivious to its connotations or hidden meanings. As soon as he was notified that a "honky-tonk angel" was southern US slang for a prostitute, the horrified Richard ordered EMI to withdraw it and refused to promote it despite making a video for it. EMI agreed to his demand despite the fact the single was expected to sell well. About 1,000 copies are known to exist on vinyl.

===1976–1994: Renaissance===
In 1976, the decision was made to repackage Richard as a rock artist. That year, Bruce Welch relaunched Cliff's career and produced the landmark album ''[[I'm Nearly Famous]]'', which included the successful but controversial guitar-driven track "[[Devil Woman (Cliff Richard song)|Devil Woman]]", which became Richard's first true hit in the United States, and the ballad "[[Miss You Nights]]". In reviewing the new album in ''[[Melody Maker]]'', Geoff Brown heralded it the renaissance of Richard.<ref>{{cite book|author=Steve Turner|title=Cliff Richard: The Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=He0S6tFOGPUC&pg=PA270|year=2008|publisher=Lion Books|isbn=978-0-7459-5279-6|page=270}}</ref> Richard's fans were excited about this revival of a performer who had been a part of British rock from its early days. Many music names such as [[Jimmy Page]], [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Elton John]] were seen sporting ''I'm Nearly Famous'' badges, pleased that their boyhood idol was getting back into the heavier rock, in which he had begun his career.

Notwithstanding this, Richard continued to release albums with [[contemporary Christian music]] content in parallel with his rock and pop albums, for example: ''[[Small Corners]]'' from 1978 contained the single "Yes He Lives". On 31 December 1976, he performed his latest single, "Hey, Mr. Dream Maker", on BBC1's ''[[A Jubilee of Music]]'', celebrating British pop music for Queen [[Elizabeth II]]'s impending [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver Jubilee]].

In 1979, Richard teamed up once again with producer [[Bruce Welch]] for the pop hit single "[[We Don't Talk Anymore (Cliff Richard song)|We Don't Talk Anymore]]", written and composed by [[Alan Tarney]], which hit No. 1 in the UK and No. 7 in the US. [[Bryan Ferry]] added hummed backing vocals to the song. The record made Richard the first act to reach the Hot 100's top 40 in the 1980s who had also been there in each of the three previous decades. The song was quickly added onto the end of his latest album ''[[Rock 'n' Roll Juvenile]],'' which was re-titled ''We Don't Talk Anymore'' for its release in the United States. It was his first time at the top of the UK singles chart in over ten years, and the song would become his biggest-selling single worldwide, selling almost five million copies throughout the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0723771/trivia |title=Cliff Richard – Trivia|publisher=IMDb |access-date=7 January 2013}}</ref> Later in 1979, Richard performed with [[Kate Bush]] at the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]'s 75th anniversary celebration at the [[Royal Albert Hall]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Mendelssohn |first=John |title=Waiting For Kate Bush |date=15 November 2004 |publisher=Omnibus Press |location=London |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i30JTVKbyjcC&q=cliff+richard+albert+hall+kate+bush&pg=PT153|isbn=9780857123237 }}</ref>

With "We Don't Talk Anymore" in 1979, Richard finally began to receive some extended success in the United States to follow on from the success of "Devil Woman" in 1976. In 1980, "[[Carrie (Cliff Richard song)|Carrie]]" broke into the US top 40, followed by "[[Dreamin' (Cliff Richard song)|Dreamin']]", which reached No. 10. His 1980 duet "[[Suddenly (Xanadu song)|Suddenly]]" with Olivia Newton-John, from the film ''[[Xanadu (film)|Xanadu]]'', peaked at No. 20, followed by "[[A Little in Love (Cliff Richard song)|A Little in Love]]" (No. 17) and "[[Daddy's Home (song)|Daddy's Home]]" (No. 23) in 1981. After many years of limited success in the US, three of his singles simultaneously charted on the last [[Hot 100]] of 1980 ("A Little in Love", "Dreamin'", and "Suddenly").<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1980-12-27 |title=The Hot 100 |work=Billboard |date=27 December 1980 |access-date=1 March 2016}}</ref> The videos for "We Don't Talk Anymore", "A Little in Love", and "Dreamin'" were [[List of first music videos aired on MTV|among the first]] to be played by [[MTV]] upon its launch in 1981.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

In the UK meanwhile, "Carrie" reached No. 4 and "Dreamin'" peaked at No. 8. In a retrospective review of "Carrie", [[AllMusic]] journalist Dave Thompson praised "Carrie" as being "an enthrallingly atmospheric number. One of the most electrifying of all Cliff Richard's recordings."<ref>{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Dave |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/carrie-mt0033082167 |title=Carrie – Cliff Richard : Listen, Appearances, Song Review |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=16 September 2012}}</ref>

In 1980, Richard officially changed his name, by [[deed poll]], from Harry Rodger Webb to Cliff Richard.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=48318 |date=24 September 1980 |page=13397 }}</ref> At the same time, he received, from the Queen, the award of [[O.B.E.|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] for services to music and charity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.debretts.com/people/biographies/browse/r/2963/Cliff,+n%C3%A9.aspx |title=Sir Cliff Richard, OBE Authorised Biography |work=Debretts |date=14 October 1940 |access-date=16 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606112054/http://www.debretts.com/people/biographies/browse/r/2963/Cliff,+n%C3%A9.aspx |archive-date=6 June 2013 }}</ref>

In 1981, the single "[[Wired for Sound (song)|Wired for Sound]]" hit No. 4 in the UK and also became Richard's biggest hit in Australia since the early 1960s. To finish the year, "Daddy's Home" hit No. 2 in the UK. On the singles chart, Richard was having his most consistent period of top twenty hits since the mid-1960s. He also was amassing a string of top ten albums, including ''[[I'm No Hero]]'', ''[[Wired for Sound]]'', ''[[Now You See Me, Now You Don't (album)|Now You See Me, Now You Don't]]'', a live album he recorded with the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] titled ''[[Dressed for the Occasion (Cliff Richard album)|Dressed for the Occasion]]'', and ''[[Silver (Cliff Richard album)|Silver]]'', marking his 25th year in show business in 1983.

In 1986, Richard reached No. 1 by teaming up with [[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]] to re-record his smash hit "[[Living Doll (song)|Living Doll]]" for the charity [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]]. Along with the song, the recording contained comedy dialogue between Richard and the Young Ones. That same year Richard opened in the [[West End theatre|West End]] as a rock musician called upon to defend Earth in a trial set in the Andromeda Galaxy in the [[multi-media]] [[Dave Clark (musician)|Dave Clark]] musical ''[[Time (musical)|Time]]''. Three Richard singles, "She's So Beautiful", which reached No. 17 in the UK, "It's in Every One of Us" and "Born To Rock 'n Roll", were released over 1985 and 1986 from the [[Time (Dave Clark album)|concept album recorded for ''Time'']].

In August 1986, Richard was involved in a five-car crash in torrential rain on the [[M4 motorway]] in West London. Richard's car was a write-off as another car swerved and braked hard. Richard hurt his back in the accident but was not seriously injured. Police called for a cab from the accident scene so that he was able to perform that night in the "Time" musical. After the show, Richard said: "I'm lucky to be here". He said that his seatbelt had prevented him from flying through the windscreen.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pop Star Performs Despite Car Accident |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&dat=19860827&id=Oc9PAAAAIBAJ&pg=1328,6177556 |newspaper=Ocala Star-Banner |date=27 August 1986 |access-date=14 May 2013}}</ref>

In October 1986, "[[All I Ask of You]]", a duet that Richard recorded with [[Sarah Brightman]] from the [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] musical version of [[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]] reached No. 3 in the UK singles chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/All+I+Ask+Of+You|title=The Official Charts Company – All I Ask of You by Cliff Richard And Sarah Brightman Search|date=6 May 2013|publisher=The Official Charts Company}}</ref> 1987 saw the release of his ''[[Always Guaranteed]]'' album, which became his best-selling album of all-new material, and included the two top-10 hit singles "[[My Pretty One]]" and "[[Some People (Cliff Richard song)|Some People]]".

Richard concluded his thirtieth year in music by achieving a UK Christmas No. 1 single in 1988 with "[[Mistletoe and Wine]]", while simultaneously holding the No. 1 positions on the album and video charts with the compilation ''[[Private Collection: 1979–1988|Private Collection]]'', which summed up his biggest hits from 1979 to 1988. "Mistletoe and Wine" was Richard's 99th UK single and spent four weeks at the top of the chart. It was the best-selling UK single of 1988, shifting 750,000 copies.<ref>{{cite news |last=Allen |first=Liam |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7787675.stm |title=The stories of the Christmas hits |work=BBC News |date=22 December 2008 |access-date=10 November 2012}}</ref> The album was certified quadruple platinum, becoming Richard's first to be certified multi-platinum by the [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]] since it introduced multi-platinum awards in February 1987.<ref name="UK certification Database">{{cite web |url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/bpi-awards|title=UK certification Database|publisher=[[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]]|access-date=30 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Gold & Platinum Official Award Discs|url=https://eil.com/store/sales-award-discs_Store.asp|publisher=eil.com|access-date=30 March 2018}}</ref>

In May 1989, Richard released his 100th single, "[[The Best of Me (David Foster song)|The Best of Me]]", becoming the first British artist to achieve the feat.<ref>{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Dave |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/stronger-mw0000470755 |title=Stronger – Cliff Richard : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=16 September 2012}}</ref> The single peaked at No. 2 in the UK. It was also the lead single from the UK top ten album ''[[Stronger (Cliff Richard album)|Stronger]]''. Released along with the singles "[[I Just Don't Have the Heart]]" (UK No. 3), "[[Lean On You]]" (No. 17) and "[[Stronger Than That]]" (No. 14), the album become Richard's first studio album to amass four UK top twenty hits.

Also in 1989, Richard received the Brits highest award: "The Outstanding Contribution award".<ref name=britaward>{{cite web|url=http://www.brits.co.uk/artist/cliff-richard|title=Brit Awards artist page|publisher=[[Brit Awards]]|access-date=15 February 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123015242/http://www.brits.co.uk/artist/cliff-richard|archive-date=23 January 2010}}</ref> In June, he filled London's [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] for two nights with a spectacular titled "The Event" in front of a combined audience of 144,000 people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nigelgoodall.co.uk/dvd/cliff-richard-from-a-distance-the-event/ |title=Cliff Richard: From A Distance – The Event |publisher=Nigel Goodall |access-date=24 December 2012}}</ref>

On 30 June 1990, Richard performed to an estimated 120,000 people at England's [[Knebworth Park]] as part of an all-star concert line-up that also included [[Paul McCartney]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Elton John]] and [[Tears for Fears]]. The concert in aid of charity was televised around the world and helped to raise $10.5&nbsp;million for disabled children and young musicians.<ref>{{cite news |title=Star-studded Knebworth concert |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&dat=19900815&id=CG1PAAAAIBAJ&pg=3758,4158889 |access-date=24 October 2014 |work=New Straits Times |date=15 August 1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=English rock benefit rolls |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19900701&id=TakcAAAAIBAJ&pg=4353,1355116 |access-date=24 October 2014 |work=The Pittsburgh Press |date=1 July 1990}}</ref>

Later in 1990, a live album titled ''[[From a Distance: The Event]]'' was released. It compiled highlights of the previous year's "The Event" show, and provided two live tracks as singles, "[[Silhouettes (The Rays song)#Cliff Richard version|Silhouettes]]" (UK No. 10) and "[[From a Distance#Cliff Richard version|From a Distance]]" (No. 11). However, it was with the Christmas single "[[Saviour's Day (song)|Saviour's Day]]" that Richard scored his 13th UK No. 1 single and his 100th top 40 hit.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cousins |first=Andrew |url=http://www.insidetime.org/articleview.asp?a=118&c=the_music_scene_in_1990 |title=The Music Scene in 1990 |work=Inside Time |access-date=10 November 2012}}</ref> The album itself reached No. 3 over the Christmas period and was certified double platinum by the [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]].<ref name="UK certification Database"/>

Following the success of the recent Christmas singles, Richard released his first Christmas album ''[[Together with Cliff Richard]]'' in 1991, but his bid for the UK Christmas No. 1 spot again with "[[We Should Be Together (song)|We Should Be Together]]" was unsuccessful (making No. 10). 1992 saw "I Still Believe in You" (No. 7) released as his Christmas single, while 1993 saw Richard's first new music studio album for over three years released. Simply titled ''[[The Album (Cliff Richard album)|The Album]]'', it debuted at No.1 on the UK album chart. "[[Peace in Our Time (song)|Peace in Our Time]]" (No. 8) was the second lead single, followed by "Human Work of Art" (No. 24) and "Healing Love" (No. 19) for Christmas. In 1994, the compilation ''[[The Hit List (Cliff Richard album)|The Hit List]]'' was released; meanwhile in the background, Richard was concentrating on bringing the musical ''[[Heathcliff (musical)|Heathcliff]]'' to the stage.

With Richard's succession of hit songs and albums from the late 1970s into the early 1980s, followed by another strong run in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a strong fan base had been reestablished and Richard remained one of the best-known music artists in the country. Over the decade of the 1980s he recorded with [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Elton John]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Phil Everly]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[Sheila Walsh (singer)|Sheila Walsh]] and [[Van Morrison]]. Meanwhile, the Shadows later re-formed (and again split). They recorded on their own, but also reunited with Richard in 1978, 1984 and 1989–90.

===1995–2007: Knighthood===
On 17 June 1995, Richard was appointed a [[Knight Bachelor]] (invested on 25 October 1995),<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=54287 |date=12 January 1996 |page=571 }}</ref> becoming the first rock star to be so honoured.<ref>[[Bob Geldof]] had been knighted nine years earlier, but his knighthood was only honorary because he was not a citizen of a [[Commonwealth realm]].</ref>

[[Image:Cliffrichard2.jpg|right|thumb|Richard performing in London during the 50th Anniversary tour in 2008]]
In 1996, he led the Wimbledon [[Centre Court]] crowd in singing during a rain delay when asked by Wimbledon officials to entertain the crowd.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cliff Richard, Centre Court, Wimbledon |url=http://www.virginmedia.com/music/pictures/toptens/gigs-in-strange-places.php|work=Gigs in strange places |publisher=Virginmedia |access-date=2 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Wimbledon 2011: entertainment values |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon/8582639/Wimbledon-2011-entertainment-values.html |access-date=2 July 2011 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=18 June 2011 |first=Mark |last=Hodgkinson}}</ref>

In late 1990s, Richard and former EMI UK managing director Clive Black established the record label "Blacknight". In 1998, Richard demonstrated that radio stations were refusing to play his music when he released a dance [[remix]] of his forthcoming single "Can't Keep This Feeling In" on a [[white label]] using the alias Blacknight. The single was featured on playlists until the true artist was revealed.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/191194.stm | work=BBC News | title=Sir Cliff foils radio ban | date=11 October 1998 | access-date=30 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/label/592175-Blacknight-2|title=Blacknight (2)|publisher=discogs|access-date=11 May 2016}}</ref> Richard then released the single under his own name as the lead single for his album ''[[Real as I Wanna Be]]'', with each reaching No. 10 in the UK on their respective charts.

In 1999, controversy again arose regarding radio stations refusing to play his releases when EMI, Richard's label since 1958, refused to release his song, "[[The Millennium Prayer]]", having judged that the song did not have commercial potential.<ref>{{cite web |last=Thompson |first=Dave |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/the-millennium-prayer-mt0018634908 |title=The Millennium Prayer – Cliff Richard : Listen, Appearances, Song Review |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=16 September 2012}}</ref> Richard took it to an independent label, Papillon, which released the charity recording (in aid of Children's Promise). The single went on to top the UK chart for three weeks, becoming his fourteenth No.1 single.<ref>{{cite news |title=Westlife top millennium chart |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/588393.stm |access-date=15 July 2018 |work=BBC News |date=4 January 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Carter |first=Helen |title=Last laugh for Sir Cliff as prayer tops the charts |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/nov/29/helencarter |access-date=15 July 2018 |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=29 November 1999}}</ref>

Richard's next album, in 2001, was a covers project, ''[[Wanted (Cliff Richard album)|Wanted]],'' followed by another top ten album, ''[[Cliff at Christmas]]''. The holiday album contained both new and older recordings, including the single "Santa's List", which reached No. 5 in 2003.<ref>{{cite news |title=Christmas number one contenders |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3281245.stm |access-date=15 July 2018 |work=BBC News |date=24 November 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Cliff tops all-time singles chart |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3512695.stm |access-date=15 July 2018 |work=BBC News |date=23 February 2004}}</ref>

Richard went to Nashville, Tennessee for his next album project in 2004, employing a writers' conclave to give him the pick of all new songs for the album ''[[Something's Goin' On]]''. It was another top-10 album, and produced three UK top-20 singles: "Something's Goin' On", "I Cannot Give You My Love", with [[Barry Gibb]] of the [[Bee Gees]], and "What Car".

On 14 June 2004, Richard joined the Shadows on-stage at the [[London Palladium]]. The Shadows had decided to re-form for another tour of the UK. It was not to be their last tour together though, as they would re-form once again for a final tour five years later in 2009.

''[[Two's Company (Cliff Richard album)|Two's Company]]'', an album of duets released in 2006, was another top-10 success for Richard and included newly recorded material with [[Brian May]], [[Dionne Warwick]], [[Anne Murray]], [[Barry Gibb]] and [[Daniel O'Donnell (Irish singer)|Daniel O'Donnell]], plus some previously recorded duets with artists such as [[Phil Everly]], Elton John and Olivia Newton-John. ''Two's Company'' was released to coincide with the UK leg of his latest world tour, "Here and Now", which included lesser known songs such as "My Kinda Life", "How Did She Get Here", "Hey Mr. Dream Maker", "For Life", "A Matter of Moments", "When The Girl in Your Arms" and the Christmas single "21st Century Christmas", which debuted at No. 2 on the UK singles chart.

Another compilation album, ''[[Love... The Album]]'' was released on 12 November 2007. Like ''Two's Company'' before it, this album includes both previously released material and newly recorded songs, namely "Waiting for a Girl Like You", "When You Say Nothing at All", "All Out of Love", "If You're Not the One" and "When I Need You" (the last was released as a single, reaching No. 38; the album peaked at No. 13).<ref>{{cite web |title=Cliff Richard – Love...The Album.

After a week of promotion, Richard flew out to rehearse for the German Night of the Proms concerts in Belgium at the end of October. He made a surprise appearance at the [[Antwerp]] concert of the Night of the Proms on Thursday, 28 October 2010 and sang "We Don't Talk Anymore" to a great reaction from the surprised 20,000 fans at [[Sportpaleis Antwerp]].

Richard was involved in a campaign to extend copyright on sound recordings in the UK from 50 to 95 years, and extend the number of years on which a musician can receive royalties. The campaign was initially unsuccessful and the UK copyright on many of Richard's early recordings expired in 2008.<ref>{{cite news |title=Musical copyright terms 'to stay' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6186436.stm |access-date=28 September 2014 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=27 November 2006}}</ref> In 2013, following another campaign, copyright on sound recordings was extended to 70 years after first publication to the public for works still in copyright at that point. This means Richard's recordings between 1958 and 1962 are out of copyright in the UK, but those from 1963 will be in copyright until 2034.<ref>{{cite news |title=Copyright in Sound Recordings |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/copyright-in-sound-recordings/copyright-in-sound-recordings |access-date=16 June 2016 |work=Intellectual Property Office |date=18 August 2014}}</ref>

In August 2018 Richard announced the release of the album ''[[Rise Up (Cliff Richard album)|Rise Up]]'', which includes new material.

In 2020 Richard released the album ''[[Music... The Air That I Breathe]]''.

==Criticism of the music industry and commercial support==
Richard has openly complained about the lack of commercial support he receives from radio stations and record labels. He spoke about this on ''[[The Alan Titchmarsh Show]]'' on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in December 2007, pointing out that while new bands needed airplay for promotion and sales, long-established artists such as himself also relied upon airplay for the same reasons. He also noted that 1980s radio stations did play his records and that this went some way to help sales and maintain his media presence. In the [[BBC Radio 2]] documentary ''Cliff – Take Another Look'', he pointed out that many documentaries charting the history of British music (e.g. ''[[I'm in a Rock 'n' Roll Band!]]'') fail to mention him (or the Shadows).<ref name="autogenerated1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/musicclub/cliff_richard.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107043403/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/musicclub/cliff_richard.shtml|url-status=dead|title=BBC|archivedate=7 January 2008}}</ref>

The head of programmes, Paul Baker, sent an e-mail to Blackburn stating that Richard "doesn't match our brand values. He's not on the playlist, and you must stop playing him." On Blackburn's next morning breakfast show, he read a print-out of the e-mail live on air to the show's 400,000 listeners and went on to play two songs by Richard. Classic Gold managing director John Baish later confirmed Blackburn's suspension from the show.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tony Blackburn in Sir Cliff row |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3833441.stm |work=BBC News| date=16 November 2011 | access-date=16 December 2013}}</ref>

In 2011, digital station [[Absolute Radio]] '60s, dedicated to playing popular music from the 1960s, announced they would not be playing any of Richard's records because they said they did not fit "the cool sound... we're trying to create". DJ [[Pete Mitchell (broadcaster)|Pete Mitchell]] said: "Timeless acts of the decade that remain relevant today are [[the Beatles]], [[The Rolling Stones|the Stones]], [[the Doors]] and [[the Who]], not Sir Cliff."

In an article for ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2011, the journalist [[Sam Leith]] wrote of Richard's lack of commercial support among radio stations: "His uncompromising Christianity, his clean-living ways, and his connoisseurship of the fruits of his Portuguese winery have made him an object of incomprehension, even ridicule, for the uncultured, alcopop-drinking younger generation."<ref>{{cite news |title=I'll tell you something about Cliff Richard – I would love to get stoned with him |first=Sam |last=Leith |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/nov/20/sam-leith-cliff-richard |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=20 November 2011 |access-date=15 May 2013}}</ref> Also writing in ''The Guardian'', [[John Robb (musician)|John Robb]] opined that because Richard has rebelled against the drink and drugs culture of typical rock stars, this "rebelling against rebellion" has made Richard something of a [[counterculture|countercultural]] icon.<ref>{{cite news |last=Robb |first=John |title=Cliff Richard: The first straight-edge icon?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/aug/18/cliff-richard-straight-edge |access-date=12 July 2015 |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=18 August 2009}}</ref>

In December 2013, Richard said that he felt two of his singles, "[[Mistletoe and Wine]]" and "[[The Millennium Prayer]]", had created a negative reaction against him. He said: "Airplay is vital for single hits. The only way I can have a fair competition is if your records are on the radio. There is an [[ageism]] in the radio industry.

Richard said that his faith in God was tested in 1999 after the murder of his close friend, the British television presenter [[Jill Dando]]. He said: "I was really angry with God.

In an interview with [[David Frost]] in 2002, Richard said that his many good friends have prevented him from feeling lonely and he has always got someone he can talk to.<ref>{{cite news |title=BBC Breakfast with Frost interview |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/breakfast_with_frost/1956448.stm |work=BBC Breakfast with Frost |access-date=9 July 2013}}</ref> Richard has been a family friend of the Northern Irish broadcaster [[Gloria Hunniford]] for over forty years. When Hunniford's daughter [[Caron Keating]] was diagnosed with breast cancer and chose to keep her illness private from the public, Richard was among a small close circle of friends who knew of Keating's condition. When Keating died in April 2004, Richard attended her funeral in Kent and performed his song "Miss You Nights" in tribute to her.<ref>{{cite web |last=Sewards |first=Lisa |title=I still think of Caron hundreds of times a day |url=http://www.lady.co.uk/people/profiles/2145-i-still-think-of-caron-hundreds-of-times-a-day |work=[[The Lady (magazine)|The Lady]] |access-date=10 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110205935/http://www.lady.co.uk/people/profiles/2145-i-still-think-of-caron-hundreds-of-times-a-day |archive-date=10 November 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Friends bid farewell to Keating |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3641065.stm |work=BBC News |access-date=10 November 2013}}</ref>

In 2006, Richard received a Portuguese Order in which he was appointed [[Order of Prince Henry|Commander of the Order of Prince Henry]] (ComIH),<ref name="cliff_henry" /> this in recognition of his forty years of personal and business involvement in that country. Richard finished No. 56 in the 2002 [[100 Greatest Britons]] list, sponsored by the BBC and voted for by the public.

In his 2008 autobiography, Richard wrote that his views on certain issues are less judgemental than when he was younger.<ref>Cliff Richard with Penny Junor ''My Life, My Way'', London: Vox Rock, 2008</ref> He called on the [[Church of England]] to affirm people's commitment in [[same-sex marriage]].<ref name=indo>{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/sir-cliff-speaks-frankly-about-his-companion-the-expriest-920825.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Sir Cliff speaks frankly about his 'companion' the ex-priest | first=Chris | last=Green | date=6 September 2008 | access-date=30 April 2010}}</ref> He wrote: "In the end, I believe, people are going to be judged for what they are.

I'm not going to judge – I'll leave that to God."<ref name="telegraph1"/>

In 2009, the British media reported on a growing friendship between Richard and [[Cilla Black]]. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' said that Richard and Black looked at properties together in Miami and were regularly seen together in Barbados, where they both owned villas. Richard and Black reportedly enjoyed each other's company dining together in Marbella and watching tennis in the Royal Box at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Walker |first=Tim |title=Cliff Richard and Cilla Black, the 'Saga holiday couple,' spotted in Marbella |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/6062174/Cliff-Richard-and-Cilla-Black-the-Saga-holiday-couple-spotted-in-Marbella.html |access-date=2 November 2013 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=20 August 2009}}</ref> After Black died in August 2015, Richard described her as "incredibly gifted" and "full of heart".

In 2010, Richard confirmed that he is no longer a resident of the United Kingdom and had been granted citizenship by Barbados. He said: "I'm officially a non-resident [of the UK], although I will always be British and proud of it."<ref name=barbados/> He currently divides his time between living in Barbados and Portugal.<ref name="portugal"/> When asked in February 2013 if he had regrets about not starting a family, Richard said that if he had been married with children he could not have devoted so much time to his career. He said: "My three sisters have children, and it's been wonderful to watch them grow up, get married and start families of their own. I've made sure I've always played a part in their lives. So while I think I would have been a good father, I've given myself to my family and I wouldn't have it any other way. My 'freedom' allows me to continue my career.

===Nationwide Festival of Light===

In 1971, Richard was a leading supporter of the [[Nationwide Festival of Light]], a movement formed by British Christians who were concerned about the development of the [[permissive society]]. Richard joined public figures such as [[Malcolm Muggeridge]], [[Mary Whitehouse]] and Bishop [[Trevor Huddleston]] to demonstrate in London "for love and family life, against pornography and moral pollution". Muggeridge criticised the media as being "largely in the hands of those who for one reason or another favour the present Gadarene slide into decadence and Godlessness."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VYNQAAAAIBAJ&pg=3661,2055143&dq=rallying+for+love+and+family+life&hl=en |title=Rallying for love and family life |newspaper=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |date=12 July 1971 }}</ref>

One of the targets for the Festival of Light's campaign was the growth of sexually explicit films.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Justin T. |title=British Film Culture in the 1970s: The Boundaries of Pleasure |date=2013 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q5LQzLFWzKUC&pg=PA140|isbn=9780748640782 }}</ref> Richard was one of approximately 30,000 people who gathered at London's [[Trafalgar Square]] for a demonstration. One focus of their protest was against the Swedish sex education film ''[[Language of Love]]'', which was showing at a nearby cinema.<ref>Daniel Ekeroth, ''Swedish Sensationsfilms: A Clandestine History of Sex, Thrillers, and Kicker Cinema'', (Bazillion Points, 2011), p. 126, {{ISBN|978-0-9796163-6-5}}.</ref>

===Philanthropy===

Since March 1966, Richard has followed the practice of giving away at least one-tenth of his income to charity.<ref>{{cite book |last=Turner |first=Steve |title=Cliff Richard: The Biography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=He0S6tFOGPUC&pg=PA365 |access-date=28 September 2013 |year=2008 |publisher=Lion Publishing |location=UK |isbn=9780745939827 |page=364}}</ref> Richard has stated that two biblical principles have guided him in how to use his money. He said: "Firstly, it was the love of money (not money itself) that was the root of all evil. Secondly, to be good and responsible stewards of what was entrusted to us."<ref>{{cite web |title=Modern day philanthropists: Cliff Richard |url=http://www.besignificant.co.uk/cliffrichard.htm |publisher=besignificant.co.uk |access-date=28 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001145616/http://www.besignificant.co.uk/cliffrichard.htm |archive-date=1 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1990, Richard said: "Those of us who have something to offer have to be prepared to give all the time."<ref name=charity/>

For over forty years Richard has been a supporter of [[Tearfund]], a Christian charity that aims to tackle poverty in many countries across the world. He has made overseas visits to see their work in Uganda, Bangladesh and Brazil. Richard has said: "Playing a part in relieving poverty is, as I see it, the responsibility of us all."<ref>{{cite web |title=Friends of Tearfund |url=http://www.tearfund.org/en/about_us/whos_who/friends_of_tearfund/ |access-date=14 February 2013}}</ref>

Richard has donated to the dementia research charity, [[Alzheimer's Research UK]]. He has helped to raise funds and awareness of the disease by speaking publicly about his mother's condition.<ref name="patrons"/>

Richard has also supported numerous UK charities over many years through the Cliff Richard Charitable Trust, both through donations and by making personal visits to schools, churches, hospitals and homes for special needs children. Richard's passion for tennis, which was encouraged by his former girlfriend Sue Barker, also led him in 1991 to establish the Cliff Richard Tennis Foundation. The charity has encouraged thousands of primary schools in the UK to introduce the sport, with over 200,000 children taking part in the tennis sessions which tour the country. The Foundation has since become part of the charitable wing of the [[Lawn Tennis Association]].<ref name="autogenerated3"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Sir Cliff Richard – Why I'll always love Surrey |url=http://www.surreylife.co.uk/people/celebrity-interviews/sir_cliff_richard_why_i_ll_always_love_surrey_1_1632896 |work=Surrey Life |access-date=16 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002093400/http://www.surreylife.co.uk/people/celebrity-interviews/sir_cliff_richard_why_i_ll_always_love_surrey_1_1632896 |archive-date=2 October 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Latest tennis opportunities for you |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sportacademy/hi/sa/tennis/give_it_a_go/newsid_3380000/3380753.stm |work=BBC Sport |access-date=28 September 2013}}</ref>
