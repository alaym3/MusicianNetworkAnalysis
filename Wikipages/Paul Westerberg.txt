'''Paul Harold Westerberg''' (born December 31, 1959) is an American musician, best known as the lead singer, guitarist, and songwriter for [[The Replacements (band)|the Replacements]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Weiss |first=Dan |url=https://www.spin.com/2010/03/billie-joe-armstrong-meets-paul-westerberg/ |title=Billie Joe Armstrong Meets Paul Westerberg |publisher=SPIN.com |date=2010-03-25 |access-date=2015-05-05}}</ref> Following the breakup of the Replacements, Westerberg launched a solo career that saw him release three albums on major record labels.

Following the release of his third solo album, Westerberg has been mostly releasing music that he has self-produced and recorded in his basement [[home studio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://onlineathens.com/stories/093004/ent_20040930043.shtml |title=Paul Westerberg releases more basement tapes |publisher=Onlineathens.com |date=2004-09-30 |access-date=2015-05-05}}</ref> He has also released two albums and an EP under the pseudonym Grandpaboy.

== Career ==

===The Replacements===
{{Main|The Replacements (band)}}
In the late 1970s, Westerberg was working as a janitor for U.S. Senator [[David Durenberger]],<ref>Valania, Jonathan. [http://www.magnetmagazine.com/2002/08/16/paul-westerberg-the-man-who-wasnt-there/ "Paul Westerberg: The Man Who Wasn’t There,"] ''[[Magnet (magazine)|Magnet]]'' (August 16, 2002).</ref> and one day while walking home from work, he heard a band practicing [[Yes (band)|Yes]]'s "[[Roundabout (song)|Roundabout]]" in a basement. He talked his way into the band by convincing the singer that the other band members — [[Bob Stinson]], [[Chris Mars]] and [[Tommy Stinson]] — were going to fire the singer. The singer quit, and Westerberg joined the group.<ref>Azerrad, Michael. ''Our Band Could Be Your Life''. Little, Brown and Company, 2001. {{ISBN|0-316-78753-1}}, p. 198.</ref> The band was originally called the Impediments, and they played their first gig in the basement of a church, playing to members of a nearby [[halfway house]] who did not appreciate their drunken shenanigans.<ref>Azerrad, 2001, p. 200.</ref> They soon changed their name to the Replacements after several venues declined to advertise the band under their original name.<ref>Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. [{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5255|pure_url=yes}} "The Replacements > Biography".] Allmusic. Retrieved 2008-02-03.</ref>

The Replacements began performing in the [[Minneapolis-St. Paul|Twin Cities]] [[Punk rock|punk]] scene, showcasing Westerberg's songs in a [[classic rock]]–friendly punk style. The band made three albums and an EP for local label [[Twin/Tone Records|Twin/Tone]] before signing to [[Sire Records]] in 1985.<ref>Azerrad, 2001. p. 227.</ref> They made four albums for Sire, each with a different lineup.

Despite the jump to Sire, the Replacements never translated their critical success into commercial sales. The band broke up in 1991. Their final album, ''[[All Shook Down]]'', was mainly a Westerberg solo project; there were a number of guest performers and the other three members of the band (including [[Slim Dunlap]], who had replaced [[Bob Stinson]] three years earlier to tour in support of ''[[Pleased to Meet Me]]''), made minimal contributions. Mars left the band soon after the album was released. After touring for the album (which was critically well-received) with replacement Replacements, Westerberg and bassist Tommy Stinson went their separate ways.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-07-05/entertainment/chi-replacements-anniversary-20-years-since-replacements-broke-up-20110705_1_band-members-stage-one-grant-park | work=Chicago Tribune | title=20 years ago at Taste of Chicago: The Replacements break up on stage | date=July 5, 2011}}</ref>

===Solo work===
Westerberg's first solo releases were two songs, "Waiting for Somebody" and "Dyslexic Heart", for the [[Singles: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|soundtrack]] to the 1992 [[Cameron Crowe]] film ''[[Singles (1992 film)|Singles]]'', for which he is also credited with composing and performing the score. The following year, [[Reprise Records]] released his first solo album, ''[[14 Songs (Paul Westerberg album)|14 Songs]]''. During the interim between solo albums, Westerberg's songs appeared on ''[[Melrose Place]]'' ("A Star Is Bored") and ''[[Friends]]'' (his cover of [[Jonathan Edwards (musician)|Jonathan Edwards]]' "[[Sunshine (Jonathan Edwards song)|Sunshine]]" and "Stain Yer Blood") television soundtracks, in 1994 and 1995 respectively. In 2007, "Dyslexic Heart" was used in the ''[[Smart People]]'' movie trailer, a selection made by [[music supervisor]] Serena Undercofler.

Westerberg co-wrote the song "Backlash" with [[Joan Jett]] for her 1991 album ''[[Notorious (Joan Jett album)|Notorious]]'' and played guitar with her on the song's video. He also recorded a duet with Jett ("Let's Do It") for the ''[[Tank Girl (film)|Tank Girl]]'' soundtrack (1994).

In 1996, he released his second solo album, titled ''Eventually'', which was tepidly received by critics and had modest sales. It did yield the alternative radio hit "Love Untold". Westerberg parted ways with Reprise Records, and the following year chose to release songs that were more [[blues]]-influenced and less slickly produced under the name [[Grandpaboy]]. An EP and single were released by indie label Soundproof/Monolyth Records. His third album, ''[[Suicaine Gratifaction]]'', is a piano-driven, melancholy, and highly personal work that was released on [[Capitol Records]] in 1999. The label was undergoing reorganization and the album was given minimal promotion.<ref>{{cite web|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/paul-westerberg-mn0000039258/biography |title=Paul Westerberg &#124; Biography |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=1959-12-31 |access-date=2015-05-05}}</ref> Westerberg appeared on a fifth-season episode of ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'' (entitled "Larry's New Love") performing "Ain't Got Me" from ''Eventually''. The episode first aired on February 26, 1997. Westerberg also performed the song that same year on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' hosted by [[Jay Leno]].

Westerberg quit the major-label circuit for three years before staging a comeback in 2002. With new management and a new independent label, [[Vagrant Records]], he released two records simultaneously, ''[[Stereo (Paul Westerberg album)|Stereo]]'' and ''Mono'' (''Mono'' being released under his alter ego Grandpaboy). ''Stereo'' and ''Mono'' were recorded in Westerberg's basement studio. Westerberg became increasingly prolific, releasing ''Dead Man Shake'' (as Grandpaboy), ''[[Come Feel Me Tremble]]'', and ''[[Folker (album)|Folker]]'' all within the next two years.

Westerberg contributed a cover of [[the Beatles]]' "[[Nowhere Man (song)|Nowhere Man]]" for the 2002 [[I Am Sam (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to the 2001 film ''[[I Am Sam]]''. Additionally, "Lookin' Up in Heaven" appears on the [[Starbucks]] sampler ''[[Hear Music]], Vol. 10: Reveal,'' "Outta My System" can be found on ''Hot Stove, Cool Music, Vol. 1,'' and the Vagrant Records sampler ''Another Year on the Streets, Vol. 3'' features "As Far As I Know." All three compilations were released in 2004.

In December 2005, Westerberg reconvened with Tommy Stinson and Chris Mars to record two new songs for the Replacements' compilation titled ''[[Don't You Know Who I Think I Was?]]'', which was released in 2006.

In 2006, Westerberg wrote eight original songs for the animated film ''[[Open Season (2006 film)|Open Season]]''. Two of the songs were covered by other artists. The track "Wild As I Wanna Be" is performed by [[Deathray]], whereas [[Pete Yorn]] performs "I Belong (Reprise)." In addition, [[Tommy Stinson]] is featured playing bass on the songs "Love You in the Fall" and "Right to Arm Bears." The soundtrack also includes the song "Good Day" from Westerberg's solo album ''Eventually''. The album is rounded out by two songs not written by Westerberg, [[Deathray]]'s own "I Wanna Lose Control (Uh Oh)" and the [[Talking Heads]]' 1986 hit "[[Wild Wild Life]]."

After he was seen on stage playing a [[First Act]] production model guitar, Westerberg collaborated with the [[Boston]]-based guitar manufacturer in September 2006 to create his signature edition PW580<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstact.com/Artists/Paul_Westerberg.aspx|title=First Act Guitars: Paul Westerberg|publisher=Firstact.com|access-date=2015-05-05| url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511160716/http://www.firstact.com/Artists/Paul_Westerberg.aspx|archive-date=May 11, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> with a red [[plaid (pattern)|plaid]] pickguard.<ref>{{cite news|work=Guitar Player|publisher=New Bay Media|title=Paul Westerberg PW580 Signature Guitar|url=http://www.guitarplayer.com/article/paul-westerberg-pw580/Feb-07/24200|date=February 2007|access-date=2008-02-01}}</ref>

On July 21, 2008, Westerberg released an album with 49 minutes' worth of music for 49 cents. The album, ''[[49:00... Of Your Time/Life]]'', was taken down from [[Amazon.com]] and [[TuneCore]] store a few weeks later. In its place, Westerberg released a song titled "5:05" (a reference to the fact that ''49:00'' was really 43:55 long, 5:05 shorter than 49:00). From the lyrical content of "5:05," it is believed that ''49:00'' was recalled because of copyright issues in the ending cover medley.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paulwesterberg.net/2008/09/30/the-strib-westerberg-stinson-together-again/ |title=The Strib: Westerberg & Stinson together again |publisher=Paulwesterberg.net |access-date=2015-05-05}}</ref>

On August 27, 2008, Westerberg released two new songs, "[[3oclockreep]]" and "Finally Here Once", on TuneCore. On September 13, 2008, another new song, "Bored of Edukation," was released as an MP3 download on Amazon.com.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=paul+westerberg |title=paul westerberg |publisher=Amazon.com |access-date=2015-05-05}}</ref> On December 24, 2008, Westerberg released three songs; "Always in a Manger", the folk music standard "[[Streets of Laredo (song)|Streets of Laredo]]", and "D.G.T." on tunecore.com for $0.74. On September 22, 2009, Westerberg released an EP titled ''PW & The Ghost Gloves Cat Wing Joy Boys'' with six songs: "Ghost on the Canvas," "Drop Them Gloves," "Good as the Cat," "Love on the Wing", "Gimmie Little Joy" and "Dangerous Boys".

Following the March 2010 death of his chief musical influence [[Alex Chilton]], Westerberg wrote a eulogy for Chilton that appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Westerberg, Paul|title=Beyond the Box Tops|date=March 20, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/opinion/21westerberg.html|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 25, 2011}}</ref> In May 2010, he played "Dangerous Boys" and "Time Flies Tomorrow" standing on the visitors' dugout at [[Target Field]] for the documentary ''40 Nights of Rock & Roll''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Riemenschneider, Chris|title=Recapping Westerberg's reclusive years|date=November 20, 2011|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/music/134121558.html|work=Star Tribune|access-date=November 25, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Shine, Kathy|title=News|date=May 31, 2010|url=http://paulwesterberg.com/news.htm|work=PaulWesterberg.com|access-date=November 25, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208074846/http://paulwesterberg.com/news.htm|archive-date=December 8, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Westerberg appeared in the video for the title track of [[Glen Campbell]]'s 2011 farewell studio recording, a cover of ''[[Ghost on the Canvas]]'' (which Westerberg wrote in 2009).<ref>{{cite news|title=Item World: Local news and views 11/4|date=November 3, 2011|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/music/133173863.html|work=Star Tribune|access-date=November 25, 2011}}</ref> In the May 24, 2013 online version of ''The New York Times''<nowiki/>' Measure for Measure feature, he set forth his songwriting creed, which privileges the virtues of inspiration and spontaneity over gradually developing and revising a song.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/24/simple-or-impossible/ | work=The New York Times | first=Paul | last=Westerberg | title=Simple or Impossible | date=May 24, 2013}}</ref>

In late 2015, Westerberg announced that he had formed a new band called [[the I Don't Cares]] with musician [[Juliana Hatfield]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vanyaland.com/2015/10/31/listen-paul-westerberg-and-juliana-hatfield-form-new-band-the-i-dont-cares/|title=Listen: Paul Westerberg and Juliana Hatfield form new band, the I Don't Cares|date=October 31, 2015|website=Vanyaland.com}}</ref> Their debut album, ''Wild Stab'', was released in January 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/wild-stab-194709/|title=The I Don't Cares 'Wild Stab' Album Review|first1=Jonathan|last1=Bernstein|date=January 29, 2016}}</ref>

The Replacements once again disbanded in 2015. Westerberg resides in [[Edina, Minnesota|Edina]], Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis.
