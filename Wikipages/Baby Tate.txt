Tate served in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] infantry during [[World War II]] in the south of England. He returned to the Spartanburg-Greenville [[nightclub|club]] circuit in 1946. He claimed to have [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] several unreleased tracks for [[Kapp Records]] in 1950. Relocating to [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]], he performed solo before forming an occasional [[duet|duo]] with [[Pink Anderson]], a working relationship that endured until the 1970s, when Anderson was disabled by a stroke.<ref name="AMG"/>

Tate released his only [[album]], ''Blues of Baby Tate: See What You Done Done'', in 1962, and twelve months later appeared in [[Samuel Charters]]'s [[documentary film]] ''The Blues''. Throughout the 1960s he performed irregularly across the United States.<ref name="AMG"/> With the harmonica player [[Peg Leg Sam]] or the guitarists Baby Brooks or McKinley Ellis, he recorded nearly sixty tracks in 1970 and 1971 for [[Peter B. Lowry]], but the proposed album remained unreleased after Tate died unexpectedly in the summer of 1972.<ref name="Wirz"/> He appeared at a concert at the [[State University of New York at New Paltz]], as a result of Lowry's efforts, in the spring of 1972.

Tate died of effects of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], in the [[Veterans Health Administration|Veterans Administration Hospital]] in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], in August 1972, at the age of 56.<ref name="AMG"/>
