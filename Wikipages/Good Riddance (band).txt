'''Good Riddance''' (sometimes abbreviated '''GR''') is an American [[punk rock]] band from [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], [[California]]. They released seven full-length studio albums on [[Fat Wreck Chords]], then disbanded after releasing a live recording of their farewell concert in 2007. They reformed in 2012 and released an eighth studio album, ''[[Peace in Our Time (Good Riddance album)|Peace in Our Time]]'', in 2015. Led by vocalist [[Russ Rankin]], the band's longtime lineup includes guitarist Luke Pabich, bassist Chuck Platt, and drummer Sean "SC" Sellers. Their sound is influenced by the hardcore punk scene and the band was known for their combination of fast [[Punk rock|punk]] with catchy melodies. Lyrical themes vary from political protests and critical analyses of American society to personal struggles and alienation.

==History==

===State of Grace===
Prior to Good Riddance, in the early 1990s Russ Rankin and Luke Pabich were members of Santa Cruz hardcore band '''State of Grace'''. State of Grace released one demo cassette, approximately 31 minutes long, in 1992; the nine tracks were recorded at "Lumberjack Studios" in "Haward" (presumably [[Hayward, California]]). They subsequently played dates on two short tours.

===Good Riddance===

Good Riddance was founded in 1986 by singer [[Russ Rankin]], but did not coalesce into a functioning band until the addition of guitarist Luke Pabich several years later.<ref name="allmusic bio">{{cite web |last=Cornelius |first=David |title=Good Riddance Biography |website=[[Allmusic]] |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p200485|pure_url=yes}} |accessdate=2010-08-31}}</ref> With bassist Devin Quinn and drummer Rich McDermott the band released its debut EP, ''[[Gidget (EP)|Gidget]]'', in 1993 through [[Austin, Texas]] record label Little Deputy Records.<ref name="allmusic bio"/><ref name="Capricorn notes">{{cite AV media notes |title=[[Capricorn One: Singles & Rarities]] |others=Good Riddance |year=2010 |first=Russ |last=Rankin |authorlink=Russ Rankin |type=CD liner |publisher=[[Fat Wreck Chords]] |id=756-2 |location=[[San Francisco]]}}</ref> 

Devin Quinn left and was temporarily replaced by Tom Kennedy before Chuck Platt joined as the band's permanent bassist.<ref name="Capricorn notes"/> 

Good Riddance signed to [[Fat Wreck Chords]], releasing their debut album ''[[For God and Country (Good Riddance album)|For God and Country]]'' and the ''[[Decoy (EP)|Decoy]]'' EP in 1995.<ref name="allmusic bio"/><ref name="Capricorn notes"/> 

Rich McDermott left and was replaced by Sean Sellers for 1996's ''[[A Comprehensive Guide to Moderne Rebellion]]''.<ref name="allmusic bio"/><ref name="Capricorn notes"/>

Sellers would continue to drum for Good Riddance until their e.p. ''[[The Phenomenon of Craving]]'', which Dave Raun from [[Lagwagon]]/[[RKL]] played on. Dave Wagenschutz, most well known as drummer for [[New Jersey]] melodic hardcore titans, [[Lifetime (band)|Lifetime]] joined the band and recorded the next two albums and toured with Good Riddance. Sellers would rejoin the band to play on their seventh studio record, "[[My Republic]]" in 2006, and on their farewell live record, ''[[Remain In Memory - The Final Show]]'' in 2007.  

Every member of the band supports [[animal rights]] and is either [[vegan]] or [[vegetarian]]. The band is a vocal supporter of [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] and the United States [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peta2.com/OUTTHERE/o-grid.asp |title=PETA2 // Out There // Good Riddance |publisher=Peta2.com |access-date=2012-02-07}}</ref>
