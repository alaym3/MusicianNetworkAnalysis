'''Paraziții''' ([[Romanian language|Romanian]] for "The [[Parasitism (social offense)|Parasites]]", {{IPA-ro|paraˈzit͡sij|pron}}) is a Romanian three-man [[hip hop music|rap]] and [[Romanian hip hop|hip hop]] group founded in 1994. It is widely regarded as one of the seminal acts of rap in Romania. It consists of [[:ro:Cheloo|Cheloo]] (Cătălin Ștefan Ion), [[:ro:Ombladon|Ombladon]] (Bogdan Ionuț Păstacă), and [[:ro:FreakaDaDisk|FreakaDaDisk]] (Petre Urda).

== History ==
The group was subject to multiple restrictions by the Romanian National Audiovisual Council, due to explicit language. Romanian television and radio stations were repeatedly fined for playing some of their videos/songs and two videos were banned outright. This motivated their song "''Jos cenzura!''" ("Down with Censorship!") which criticized the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic]] government and was released shortly before the local elections in June 2004; the music video includes a monologue of [[Larry Flynt]] blasting Romania's government for its censorship practices.

'''Ombladon''', member of the group, won the Best Romanian Act Award at the [[MTV Europe Music Awards]] in 2004 with the song "Egali din naștere" (Born Equal).

In 2003 they established their own label, "20CM Records", providing launch pads for [[Romanian hip hop]] artists such as Spike and [[Guess Who (rapper)|Guess Who]].

Their first recorded track, "''În jur''" ("Around" – a [[pun]] on ''Înjur'' – I [[Profanity|curse]]), dated 13 September 1994, represented Paraziții's breakthrough. At the "''Nici o problemă''" (No Problem) album release concert, a big fight started due to the [[La Familia (rap group)|La Familia]]-[[R.A.C.L.A.]] musical war.

Paraziții first performed out of [[Romania]] in 2000 by participating at the "Summer Hits" festival in [[Chișinău]], along with the groups [[BUG Mafia]] and [[Zdob și Zdub]].

In 2002 and 2003 the group performed in tours in Germany, [[Austria]] and the [[Netherlands]]. Due to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the group lost the opportunity to perform in a Canada-US tour. The most important event remains the act at the Wuppertal Rap-Attack festival (2004) when Paraziții were the only group to perform before the well known rap/hip-hop artist [[Grandmaster Flash]].

Paraziții were part of major campaigns like "Playback" / "Shoot Yourself" (2001), in which they took a firm position against [[Lip sync#Lip synching songs|lip synching]], or "''Instigare la cultură''" (Instigation To Culture) (2004) against ignorance among Romania's youth.

Paraziții tracks were featured on movie soundtracks like "Nordrand" ([[Austria]]), "''Visul lui Liviu''" ([[Liviu's Dream]]), "''Milionari de weekend''" (Weekend Millionaires) or "''Marfa și banii''" (The Goods and The Money).
