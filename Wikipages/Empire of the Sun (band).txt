==History==

===2000–2007: Formation===
[[Luke Steele (musician)|Luke Steele]] and [[Nick Littlemore]] met in 2000 after being introduced by Steele's [[Artist and repertoire|A&R]] executive, Simon Moor,<ref name="West">{{cite news|title=Man of Steele|publisher=West Australian Newspapers Ltd|work=[[The West Australian]]|date=26 September 2009|last=Collins|first=Simon}}</ref> in a bar in [[Sydney]].<ref name="RTÉ">{{cite news |url = http://www.rte.ie/ten/features/2009/0213/416131-empireofthesun/|title = Empire of the Sun interview|access-date = 27 November 2009|date = 8 April 2009|publisher = [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]|last = McGee|first = Linda}}</ref> Both were at the time signed to [[EMI]] and had already been working on different projects.<ref name="prefix" /> Over the years that followed, the two collaborated on a number of occasions. Littlemore helped write the song "Tell the Girls That I'm Not Hangin' Out",<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.discogs.com/Sleepy-Jackson-Lovers/release/899109 |title = Sleepy Jackson, The - Lovers at Discogs |access-date = 24 December 2011 |publisher = Discogs }}</ref> which appeared on [[The Sleepy Jackson]]'s 2003 debut album, ''[[Lovers (The Sleepy Jackson album)|Lovers]]'',<ref name="West" /> and Steele had some artistic input in Littlemore's 2006 art-rock project [[Teenager (band)|Teenager]].<ref>{{cite web |url =http://www.discogs.com/viewimages?release=1197010|title=Teenager Bound and Gagged Press njj Copy at Discogs |access-date = 24 December 2011}}</ref> After a falling out over the song on ''Lovers'' the co-operation ceased for a while, with Littlemore commenting "I'm a very intense person and I take things to heart".<ref name="rolling">{{cite web |url = http://jasontreuen.wordpress.com/2008/02/04/rolling-stone-pnau-interview/|title = Rolling Stone: Pnau interview|publisher = Rolling Stone|access-date = 26 August 2010|website = jasontreuen.wordpress.com|first = Jason|last = Treuen|date = 4 February 2008}}</ref>

The two reconvened in 2006 to work on two songs for the ''[[Pnau (album)|Pnau]]'' album that was released in late 2007. They collaborated on the tracks "Freedom" and the opener "With You Forever" where Steele supplied the vocal. This prompted a change in direction for the band who began to craft a work more vocally-centered album featuring guest performances.<ref>{{cite web|title = Pnau - Hyperactive|url = http://www.music-house.co.uk/hyperactive/artist_information.html?artist_id=2882|website = www.music-house.co.uk|access-date = 2015-06-14|publisher = Hyperactive|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105072835/http://www.music-house.co.uk/hyperactive/artist_information.html?artist_id=2882|archive-date = 5 January 2016|url-status = dead}}</ref> A track-by-track analysis of the album ''Pnau'' revealed that writing of "With You Forever" with Luke Steele inspired Littlemore's band to begin work on a collaborative project.<ref name="tracklist">{{cite web | url = http://pnau.net/bio/pnautracks.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090205144157/http://pnau.net/bio/pnautracks.pdf | archive-date = 5 February 2009 | title = Pnau.net Track by Track Analysis at Web Archive.org | access-date = 25 December 2011 }}</ref> Littlemore said, "We fell in love with music again with [With You Forever]; I think this is [Pnau's] first great song." The release of ''Pnau'' brought an interest from [[Elton John]], who signed Littlemore to his management company.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://crushable.com/entertainment/elton-john-loves-pnau/ | title = Elton John Loves PNAU | publisher = Crushable | access-date = 26 August 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110727133628/http://crushable.com/entertainment/elton-john-loves-pnau/ | archive-date = 27 July 2011 | url-status = dead}}</ref>

The new project began to develop under the working title of "Steelemore" as a collaboration between Steele and Littlemore,<ref name="rolling" /> with Pnau partner Peter Mayes listed as a producer and occasional co-writer.<ref>{{cite web|title = Planet Notion » Interview: Peter Mayes of Pnau|url = http://www.planetnotion.com/2012/08/13/interview-peter-mayes-of-pnau/|access-date = 2015-08-17|date = 13 August 2013|website = planetnotion.com|publisher = The Random Agency}}</ref> As Steele was living in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and Littlemore was in [[Sydney]] the two spent time writing songs separately while meeting occasionally in Sydney to decide on the musical direction and style.<ref name="RTÉ" /> When they had accumulated enough material Mayes and duo began to record the album throughout 2007 with the assistance of Jonathan Sloan.<ref name="prefix" /><ref>{{cite web|title = Nick Littlemore & Luke Steele team up|url = http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/14461/Nick-Littlemore-Luke-Steele-team-up|date = 14 August 2008|last = Hardaker|first = Tim|website = fasterlouder.com.au|publisher = Fasterlouder Pty}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===2007–2012: ''Walking on a Dream''===
While the record had been largely recorded and mixed throughout 2007, the self-titled Pnau album took precedence for Littlemore and Mayes in the first half of 2008. The duo put out the title-track "[[Walking on a Dream (song)|Walking on a Dream]]" in anticipation of the album's release. It appeared in digital format on 30 August 2008,<ref>{{cite web|title = Empire of the Sun - Walking on a Dream|url = http://www.discogs.com/Empire-Of-The-Sun-Walking-On-A-Dream/release/1531669|website = Discogs|access-date = 2015-08-18}}</ref> and received airtime on Australian radio and reached number ten on the [[ARIA Charts|Australian ARIA Singles Chart]].<ref name="aus" /> A second single, titled "[[We Are the People (Empire of the Sun song)|We Are the People]]", was released on 30 September and peaked at number twenty-four in Australia.<ref name="aus" /> The album ''[[Walking on a Dream (album)|Walking on a Dream]]'' appeared on 3 October 2008 and debuted at number eight on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Albums Charts]], peaking at number six.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Empire+Of+The+Sun&titel=Walking+On+A+Dream&cat=a |title=Empire of the Sun – Walking on a Dream |website=australian-charts.com |access-date=28 April 2013}}</ref> The duo embarked on an international promotional tour in support of the album that was released in Europe in February/March 2009 followed by a North American release in April of the same year. While the project had initially been conceived as studio-only, the growing success brought "an audience [to which] we felt a duty to be good to them".<ref name="musicOMH">{{cite web|title = Interview: Empire of the Sun|url = http://www.musicomh.com/features/interviews/interview-empire-of-the-sun|website = musicOMH|access-date = 2015-08-18|last = Hubbard|date = 28 June 2013|first = Michael|publisher = OMH}}</ref> Upon their return to Australia Steele began to prepare for a live debut of the band at [[Parklife Music Festival|Parklife Festival]] in September and October 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Parklife 2009 lineup announced |url=http://www.thevine.com.au/music/festivals/parklife-2009-lineup-announced-20090604-251741 |access-date=2015-08-17 |website=thevine.com.au |date=4 June 2009 |publisher=Digital Media }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The headlined three shows, described as a visual "overload [where] giant graphics swam and spun over the stage as costumed dancers writhed to the beat and Steele on a pedestal onstage, [wearing] a gigantic metallic headpiece and his usual 'Ming The Merciless' robe".<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Parklife 2009: Empire Of The Sun, Metric, Lady Sovereign |url=http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/clubs/events/10974/parklife-2009-empire-of-the-sun-metric-lady-sovereign |first=Jonathon |last=Valenzuela |date=4 October 2009 |journal=Time Out |publisher=Time Out Group Ltd. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105230156/http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/clubs/events/10974/parklife-2009-empire-of-the-sun-metric-lady-sovereign |archive-date=5 January 2016 }}</ref> A third single, "[[Standing on the Shore]]" was released in June 2009<ref>{{cite web|title = Empire of the Sun - Standing on the Shore|url = http://www.discogs.com/Empire-Of-The-Sun-Standing-On-The-Shore/release/2094240|website = Discogs|access-date = 2015-08-18}}</ref> however promotion was scaled back when Steele suffered from exhaustion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/news/luke-steele-to-take-break|title=Luke Steele To Take Break|last=Murray|first=Robin|date=8 June 2009|website=Clash|access-date=2016-09-10}}</ref> A remixed version "[[Without You (Empire of the Sun song)|Without You]]" was released as the album's fourth single the following September.<ref>{{cite web|title = Empire of the Sun - Without You (New Version)|url = http://www.discogs.com/Empire-Of-The-Sun-Without-You-New-Version/release/2085921|website = Discogs|access-date = 2015-08-18}}</ref>{{multiple image|image1=Luke Steele 2013-05-31.jpg|width1=200|image2=Pnau'sNickLittlemoreA.jpg|width2=116|footer=[[Luke Steele (musician)|Luke Steele]] (''left'') and [[Nick Littlemore]] (''right''), the members of Empire of the Sun}}Littlemore decided to opt out of performing with the band live, citing 'I’ve always felt that once you make a record it's not yours anymore'.<ref name="musicOMH" /> Steele gave the impression that his partner left the band in September 2009, however, Littlemore resurfaced in the following month, citing his production work and a project with [[Cirque du Soleil]] as the reason for the lack of communication.<ref>{{cite web|title = Empire of the Sun's 'missing' member resurfaces|url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/oct/01/empire-of-the-sun|website = The Guardian|access-date = 2015-08-18|first = Sean|last = Michaels|date = 1 October 2009}}</ref> He divided his time between the UK and Montreal while working on other creative commitments.<ref name="TheMusicNetwork" /> Steele continued to perform live with the band at a number of Australian outdoor events.<ref>{{cite web|title = One sleep until Full Noise fest|url = http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/news/full-noise-festival-ready-go/386084/|access-date = 2015-08-18|date = 23 October 2009|website = themorningbulletin.com.au}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = Foreshore Summer Music Festival all set for Saturday!|url = http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/21560/Foreshore-Summer-Music-Festival-all-set-for-Saturday|access-date = 2015-08-18|website = fasterlouder.com.au|date = 26 November 2009|last = McMaster|first = Matt}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Towards the end of 2009, the band received a number of ARIA Awards for ''Walking on a Dream'', including Best Album of the Year.<ref name="ARIA2009" />

Steele received global media attention following an interview he completed with music publication ''NME'' in August 2013 at the Sziget Festival in [[Budapest]]. During the interview, Steele compared ''Ice on the Dune'' with [[Daft Punk]]'s 2013 album release ''[[Random Access Memories]]'', stating: "They had a great marketing campaign, but we’ve got better songs."<ref>{{cite web |title=Luke Steele vs Daft Punk: "We've got better songs" |url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/36598/Luke-Steele-vs-Daft-Punk-Weve-got-better-songs |work=Faster Louder |publisher=Faster Louder Pty Ltd |access-date=16 August 2013 |author=Tom Mann |date=15 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820085114/http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/36598/Luke-Steele-vs-Daft-Punk-Weve-got-better-songs |archive-date=20 August 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2014 the band performed at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella Festival]], headlining the Sahara Tent.<ref name="LATimes">{{cite news |title=Coachella 2014: Empire of the Sun brings pomp and circumstance to the rave tent |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ph-coachella-2014-empire-of-the-sun-brings-pomp-to-the-rave-tent-20140420-story.html |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |access-date=17 August 2015 |issn=0458-3035 |language=en|first=Chris |last=Lee}}</ref>

"Alive" was used in the introduction video for Google I/O 2013. It was also played within the introduction video of the new [[Yahoo!]] logo on 5 September 2013, played over the [[end credits]] of the 2013 film ''[[Paranoia (2013 film)|Paranoia]]'', and featured in the movie ''[[Dumb and Dumber To]]''.

In December 2014, Empire of the Sun released two songs, "Tonight" and "Wandering Star", which were written for the [[Farrelly brothers]] film, ''[[Dumb and Dumber To]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Empire of the Sun Say New Album Is 'On God's Timetable'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/empire-of-the-sun-say-new-album-is-on-gods-timetable-20140408|access-date=9 September 2015}}</ref> For much of 2015, the duo were writing and recording of their third album in Hawaii and Los Angeles. By the end of the year, Steele noted that the new release was "75 percent there".<ref name=":0" />

The band continued to perform live in the second half of 2015, including a show at the Hollywood Bowl.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dailybruin.com/2015/09/21/empire-of-the-sun-lights-up-hollywood-bowl-with-psychedelic-show/|title=Concert Review: Empire of the Sun lights up Hollywood Bowl with psychedelic show|last=Kapur|first=Alisha|date=21 September 2015|website=dailybruin.com|access-date=2016-09-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://themusic.com.au/news/all/2015/09/22/empire-of-the-sun-perform-to-sell-out-crowd-at-hollywood-bowl/|title=Empire of the Sun Perform To Sell-Out Crowd at Hollywood Bowl|website=theMusic|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-09-10}}</ref>

In January 2016, the band's 2008 album title track "[[Walking on a Dream (song)|Walking on a Dream]]" was featured in a national commercial titled "The Dreamer" in the United States for the Japanese automaker [[Honda]] to promote the 2016 [[Honda Civic]].<ref>{{cite web|title = 2016 Honda Civic TV Spot, 'The Dreamer' Song by Empire of the Sun|url = http://www.ispot.tv/ad/AZUX/2016-honda-civic-the-dreamer|website=iSpot.tv|access-date=24 January 2016}}</ref> The song finally led to the US chart breakthrough for the band, peaking at number 3 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Alternative music charts, topping the dance music charts, and peaking at number 40 on the Mainstream Top 40 chart.

===2016–present: ''Two Vines''===
In August 2016, it was announced that the third album ''[[Two Vines]]'' was set for release on 28 October 2016. The album was co-produced by Peter Mayes and features contributions by [[Lindsey Buckingham]], [[Wendy Melvoin]], and former [[David Bowie]] collaborators Henry Hey and [[Tim Lefebvre]].<ref name="Two Vines Pitchfork">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/67672-empire-of-the-sun-announce-new-album-two-vines/|title=Empire of the Sun Announce New Album Two Vines|last=Pearce|first=Sheldon|date=22 August 2016|website=Pitchfork}}</ref> The 15-track album includes a remix of the song "Walking on a Dream" and was partly recorded in Hawaii. Littlemore explained the inspiration behind the title as "this image of a modern city overtaken by jungle".<ref name="Two Vines Pitchfork" /> The first single "[[High and Low (Empire of the Sun song)|High and Low]]" was released on 24 August. "High and Low" was also featured in the [[EA Sports]] game, ''[[FIFA 17]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/empire-of-the-sun-recruit-lindsey-buckingham-for-new-lp-w435577|title=Empire of the Sun Recruit Lindsey Buckingham for New LP|last=Reed|first=Ryan|date=22 August 2016|access-date=23 August 2016}}</ref>

In an interview with Billboard in August 2017, Steele announced that he and Littlemore had recently started working on their fourth album in Japan, and that a music video for "Way to Go" was also shot in Japan. He spoke of how he loves Japanese music, and that a [[Koto (instrument)|koto]] player came in for a day.<ref>{{Citation|last=Billboard|title=Luke Steele of Empire of The Sun - Looking Back at 10 Years of Performing! {{!}} Billboard|date=2017-08-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rM6u0KZIjVs|access-date=2017-09-12}}</ref>

In September 2017, [[DS Automobiles]] released a video featuring a new exclusive Empire song, "On Our Way Home", starring the Ukrainian actress and model Alina Kovalenko.<ref>{{Citation|last=DS Official|title=DS reveals on Our Way Home by Empire of the Sun|date=2017-09-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNZHn4k8AwI|access-date=2017-09-12}}</ref>

According to a podcast with Nick Littlemore as a guest, a new album is being worked on, but no release date has been revealed.

== Name ==
Although the name of the project has been attributed to the 1984 [[Empire of the Sun|novel of the same name]] by [[J. G. Ballard]],<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web |url = https://www.allmusic.com/artist/empire-of-the-sun-mn0001035496/biography|title = Empire of the Sun {{!}} Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|access-date = 18 July 2016|last = Phares|first = Heather}}</ref> Littlemore denied this and offers an explanation, saying, "the name comes more from the idea of ... the fact that we're traveling around the world going to all the places of empires of the civilization where the sun has been a theme of worship. It's not based on the Ballard novel nor the Spielberg film of the same name."<ref name="RTÉ" />

== Style ==
The band employs elaborate stage sets and headdress (such as wearing [[kabuto]]s, [[war bonnet]]s and war paint) , which reflects the duo's background in visual art. Littlemore explained that "we did see [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]'s ''[[The Holy Mountain (1973 film)|Holy Mountain]]'' and it influenced the way we could think about visualization".<ref>{{cite web|title = Going Far Out With Empire of the Sun {{!}} SPIN|url = http://www.spin.com/2013/06/empire-of-the-sun-new-album-ice-on-a-dune-interview/|access-date = 2015-09-09}}</ref> The band has worked with a number of designers, including Jessica Huerta.<ref name=":0" /> Steele described the inspiration for the visual aspect as "the vision of this band, it's built on imagination, so it comes from studying the [[samurai]]s in art school to digital graphics, to [[topography]], to filming under the ocean, to oil paintings, anything really."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pigeonsandplanes.com/2013/06/empire-of-the-sun-interview/|title=Interview: Empire of the Sun's Luke Steele on "Ice on the Dune," Working With Jay-Z, and His Thoughts on Daft Punk|author=White, Caitlin|publisher=Pigeons and Planes|date=4 June 2013|access-date=23 August 2013}}</ref>
