==History==
Rainbow Kitten Surprise was formed in 2013 by Sam Melo and Darrick Keller, while they were writing music and composing together, as they attended [[Appalachian State University]].  Their first EP, “Mary” was recorded in a dorm room at the university.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/music/Rainbow+Kitten+Surprise/+wiki|title=Rainbow Kitten Surprise hometown, biography|website=Last.fm}}</ref> They later added three new members, Ethan Goodpaster, Jess Haney, and Charlie Holt. RKS independently released its first album, “Seven,” which was later re-released together with the band's first EP as a joint album called “Seven + Mary.”  RKS initially recorded its music under the Split Rail Records label, a student run label at Appalachian State University's Hayes School of Music, where three of the band's members attended.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://today.appstate.edu/2015/02/03/rainbow-kitten-surprise|title=Alternative/indie-pop band signs with Appalachian’s Split Rail Records|website=today.appstate.edu}}</ref> From 2014 through 2017, Rainbow Kitten Surprise has performed at multiple music festivals and other events, including [[Bonnaroo Music Festival|Bonnaroo]] Music and Arts Festival and [[Austin City Limits]] Festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoP1co2UjJ8 |title=Rainbow Kitten Surprise - October Tour 2017 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2020-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUqua1vFdE4 |title=Rainbow Kitten Surprise- Devil Like Me ACL Fest 2017 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2020-06-09}}</ref>

In early 2018, RKS released its “How To: Friend, Love, Freefall” album, under the [[Elektra Records]] label. It features 13 tracks, including the deeply revealing and emotional “Hide” single, and music video about four drag queens coming out to their families.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/pride/8287093/rainbow-kitten-surprise-hide-video-kyle-thrush|title=Director Kyle Thrash Takes Fans Inside Rainbow Kitten Surprise's Emotional 'Hide' Video|date=April 4, 2018|website=Billboard}}</ref> Its "Fever Pitch" single from the new album climbed to 34th most popular song on Billboard's Alternative Song chart in spring 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/alternative-songs|title=Alternative Songs Chart|website=Billboard}}</ref> In spring and summer 2018, the group toured the US and Canada to promote the album.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180118204329/http://www.rksband.com/friendlovefreefall/]</ref>

In May 2019, RKS released ''Mary (B-sides)'', consisting of a studio recording of "Heart" (a song originally released via YouTube and SoundCloud in 2014) and a new track "No Vacancy".

In June 2019, they performed at the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheater which they sold out in 7 days. This was the last stop on their summer tour.

In January 2020, the long-running PBS show Austin City Limits aired Rainbow Kitten Surprise in a half-hour set recorded the previous fall.

On July 14th, 2020, RKS played a livestream concert, their first of the year because of the cancellation of many events due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. 

On October 9th, 2020, Rainbow Kitten Surprise released a new single, titled “Our Song,” which had been previously played at multiple live events. This single marked their first release as a band since May 2019.
