'''Oomph!''' is a German rock band from [[Wolfsburg]], formed in 1989. The band pioneered the [[Neue Deutsche Härte]] movement.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/oomph%21-mn0000400479/biography | title=Oomph! | publisher=[[AllMusic]] | access-date=April 5, 2014 | author=Reges, Margeret}}</ref> Their work contains lyrics in both English and German, with a shift towards German exclusively on recent albums (''[[GlaubeLiebeTod]]'', ''[[Monster (Oomph! album)|Monster]]'', ''[[Des Wahnsinns fette Beute (Oomph! album)|Des Wahnsinns fette Beute]]'', ''[[XXV (Oomph! album)|XXV]]'', and ''[[Ritual (Oomph! album)|Ritual]]'' are entirely in German).

==History==

===Early years (1989–2002)===
Oomph! incorporated many styles of music such as [[Heavy metal music|metal]], [[Industrial music|industrial]], [[alternative rock]], [[electronica]] and [[Gothic rock|gothic]] to create their sound. Their style changed between their self-titled debut, ''[[Oomph! (album)|Oomph!]]'' (1992), and its successor ''[[Sperm (album)|Sperm]]'' (1994). Though they started with very much a dance-laden industrial sound, they quickly moved to a much more heavily guitar-driven [[Heavy metal music|metal]] sound, while still acknowledging their [[Electronic body music|electronic]] roots. This guitar-driven and electronic accompanied sound inspired numerous musicians, most famously [[Rammstein]], [[Megaherz]], and [[Eisbrecher]], to follow their lead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/music/OOMPH!/+wiki?b=16&a=15|title=OOMPH! hometown, lineup, biography|website=Last.fm|access-date=March 16, 2019}}</ref>

Oomph! was signed on [[Virgin Schallplatten]] between 1998 and 2001, where they released three albums; the first, ''[[Unrein]]'', was released in 1998, which became their debut album on the German [[Media Control Charts]], peaking at No.&nbsp;37, and the Austrian top 40 at No.&nbsp;38. A single called "[[Gekreuzigt]]" was released in 1998 to promote ''Unrein'' and became the band's debut single on the German charts, peaking at No.&nbsp;81.

The second Virgin album, ''[[Plastik]]'', was released in 1999 and peaked in Germany at No.&nbsp;23. The third, ''[[Ego (album)|Ego]]'', was released in 2001, peaking at No.&nbsp;21 on the Media Control Charts. This fulfilled their contract with Virgin; the band did not continue with the record company, feeling that it never fully explored their potential. With the benefits of major-label status, Oomph! gained a larger following and toured with labelmates [[Skunk Anansie]] in 1999, later opening for Finnish rock band [[HIM (Finnish band)|HIM]] in fall 2001.

In 2002, Oomph! played at the [[Ozzfest]] in Germany, alongside [[Black Label Society]], [[Tool (band)|Tool]] and [[Ozzy Osbourne]] on 20 May. The band appeared at the [[With Full Force]] Festival on 5 July 2002. On 19 December 2002, Oomph! opened for [[Apoptygma Berzerk]].

===''Wahrheit oder Pflicht'' and ''GlaubeLiebeTod'' (2004–2007)===
In 2004, Oomph! released their first single, "[[Augen auf!]]" ("Open your eyes!"), from their eighth album ''[[Wahrheit oder Pflicht]]'' on a new label, this time on [[Supersonic Records]], part of the [[Sony BMG Music Entertainment|Sony BMG]] group of music companies. It marks their first number one hit in Germany, eventually bringing forth their major commercial breakthrough. The album hit No. 2 on the [[Media Control Charts]].

In June 2004, Oomph! played at two major European music festivals: the [[Dynamo Open Air]] Festival on 5 June in the Netherlands, and on 25 June at the [[Graspop Metal Meeting]] in Belgium.

"Augen auf!" became part of the ''[[FIFA Football 2005]]'' soundtrack. Oomph! appeared for the first time at [[Wacken Open Air]] on 4 August 2005.

The band's ninth album, ''[[GlaubeLiebeTod]]'' ("FaithLoveDeath"), was released in March 2006, including the controversial single "[[Gott ist ein Popstar]]" ("God is a popstar"), its follow-up "Das letzte Streichholz", "Die Schlinge", and "[[Träumst du?]]".

In August 2006, [[Virgin Schallplatten|Virgin]] released the compilation album ''1998–2001: Best of Virgin Years''. It contains tracks from Oomph!'s three Virgin albums as well as a few unreleased tracks. The band distanced itself from this best-of release and asked that fans not buy it, as the band's current label GUN had scheduled a best-of compilation as well.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}

On 15 June 2006, Oomph! played at the [[Nova Rock Festival]] in Austria.

On 1 December 2006, Oomph!'s official best-of album, ''[[Delikatessen (Oomph! album)|Delikatessen]]'' (''Delicacies'') was released under the GUN label. The songs on it were hand-picked by the band itself. It contains tracks from all nine Oomph! albums, [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]], remixes, and new tracks like "The Power of Love" and "Gekreuzigt 2006". By 17 November 2006, Oomph! released those two songs in a form of double-single to promote the new compilation release.

On 9 February 2007, the band released their final ''GlaubeLiebeTod'' single "Träumst du?", featuring the female vocalist from [[Die Happy]], [[Marta Jandová]]. The single peaked at No. 9 on the [[Media Control Charts]]. Oomph! performed the song live the same day at the 2007 edition of [[Bundesvision Song Contest]], representing [[Lower Saxony]] in the competition, coming in first place.

On 6 July 2007, Oomph! opened for [[Metallica]] in Vienna, Austria.

Oomph!'s first DVD was ''[[Rohstoff]]'', which contains live footage consisting of 23 songs, most of the videos the band has created, making-of videos, and an exclusive interview. The DVD was released on July 20, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=24164_0_2_0_C|title=Oomph! come up with first live DVD|access-date=March 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622063915/http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=24164_0_2_0_C|archive-date=June 22, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The remaining tracks were released as [[B-side]]s on the upcoming singles. The first and only was "[[Sandmann (song)|Sandmann]]", released in February 2009.

Oomph! opened for [[Marilyn Manson]] on 24 June 2009 in [[Linz]], Austria.

The band recorded a version of "Ernten was wir säen" by [[Die Fantastischen Vier]] for the 2009 compilation album ''A Tribute to Die Fantastischen Vier''.

On 26 February 2010, the band released their fourth compilation album, ''Truth or Dare'', with their German songs re-recorded in English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oomph.de/oomph/news_en.html|title=Oomph's Official Page|access-date=March 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204133219/http://www.oomph.de/oomph/news_en.html|archive-date=February 4, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> From 24 April to 22 October, the band toured Europe to promote the new compilation album.
