Watain's debut album ''[[Rabid Death's Curse]]'' was released through [[End All Life Productions]] and [[Drakkar Productions]] in 2000, followed by a split EP with [[Diabolicum]] released through Spikekult Records. A split LP with Malign was planned in the early 2000s and supposed to be issued by Grim Rune Productions before the recording of Watain's second album ''[[Casus Luciferi]]'',<ref name=heint /> but never got released. Watain toured Europe with [[Unpure]] in early 2002.<ref name=origin /> In 2003, they again entered the studio to record their second full-length album, ''Casus Luciferi'', which features lyrics by [[Tore Stjerna|Necromorbus]] of [[Funeral Mist]] (who also produced all their studio releases since ''The Essence of Black Purity'' and played live bass for them<ref>Watain: ''The Ritual Macabre'', Sakrilegious Warfare Productions 2001.</ref>), MkM of [[Antaeus (band)|Antaeus]] and Scorn of [[Katharsis (band)|Katharsis]].

They're trying to appear extreme and limit their selves in their conception to that kind of society, which describes something that we wouldn't care less about. Fuck the world!

In 2010, Watain released a single for the song "[[Reaping Death]]" in two formats, picture disc vinyl with a cover of the song "Chains of Death" by [[Death SS]], and digisleeve CD with a cover of the song "The Return of Darkness and Evil" by [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]]. It was followed by the album ''[[Lawless Darkness]]'', released on 7 June 2010, which received very positive reviews from music critics and earned the band their first [[Grammis|Swedish Grammi]] for 'Best Hard Rock' album.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/watain-mainman-on-grammmis-award-the-devil-won-again/|title=Watain Mainman On Grammis Award: 'The Devil Won Again!'|date=22 January 2011|newspaper=Blabbermouth.net|access-date=13 November 2016}}</ref> In 2012, Watain performed at [[Wacken Open Air]] and [[Bloodstock Open Air|Bloodstock]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wacken.com/en/festival-info/history/woa-2012/billing-20120/|title=W:O:A – Billing/Bands 2012|website=Wacken.com|access-date=8 October 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bloodstock.uk.com/events/boa-2012/bands/watain|title=Band Profile for Watain – boa-2012 {{!}} Bloodstock|website=Bloodstock.uk.com|access-date=15 November 2016}}</ref> The band participated in the U.S. Decibel tour with [[Behemoth (band)|Behemoth]] and [[In Solitude]], and supported Behemoth again on their 'The Satanist' tour of Australia with Bölzer.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/tour-dates/decibel-magazine-tour-dates-available-behemoth-watain-in-solitude|title=Decibel Magazine Tour Dates Available (BEHEMOTH, WATAIN, IN SOLITUDE) – Metal Injection|date=26 January 2012|newspaper=Metal Injection|access-date=15 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/behemoth-announce-australian-satanist-tour-with-watain/|title=Behemoth Announce Australian 'Satanist' Tour With Watain – Music Feeds|date=19 May 2015|newspaper=Music Feeds|access-date=15 November 2016}}</ref> On 7 May 2012 the band released a DVD and live album ''Opus Diaboli – 13 Years of Black Metal Magic'' directed by Johan Bääth and Watain.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/watain-to-unleash-13th-anniversary-dvd/|title=WATAIN To Unleash 13th-Anniversary DVD|date=5 April 2012|newspaper=Blabbermouth.net|access-date=15 November 2016}}</ref>

Their fifth full-length album, ''[[The Wild Hunt (Watain album)|The Wild Hunt]]'', was released on 19 and 20 August 2013 in Europe and United States, respectively, and featured a change in style for the band as they incorporated elements of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[progressive metal]], and [[doom metal]].

On 2 August 2017, Watain confirmed the release date of their long-awaited sixth Full-length studio album, the title of which was later revealed as ''[[Trident Wolf Eclipse]]''. This release was accompanied by a short album release tour in several selected venues in Europe.  The first single titled 'Nuclear Alchemy' from the new album, was released on 31 October. ''Trident Wolf Eclipse'' was officially released on 5 January 2018 through [[Century Media Records]] to generally favourable reviews from critics who noted that the album signalled a return to the band's earlier, more aggressive black metal style compared to their previous album ''The Wild Hunt''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.centurymedia.com/newsdetailed.aspx?IdNews=22141&IdCompany=3|title=Century Media Records – Watain: : - release new track "Sacred Damnation", pre-sale of "TRIDENT WOLF ECLIPSE" up and running|website=Centurymedia.com|access-date=7 January 2018}}</ref>

Due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], Watain was forced to cancel and indefinitely postpone their planned performances at [[Hellfest (French music festival)|Hellfest 2020]], [[Las Vegas]] and their [[Walpurgis Night]] concert in their hometown of Uppsala, these performances were meant to mark the end of the ''Trident Wolf Eclipse'' album cycle. The band independently released an exclusive 7 track live cassette tape titled ''Corona Mortis'' on 2 July 2020 which was limited to the number of pre-orders and never to be reprinted again as part of a campaign fund to counter the pandemic's impact, the tape is a one take rehearsal recorded at the band's headquarters.

On 5 August 2021, Watain announced that they had signed with [[Nuclear Blast Records]] and had entered Necromorbus Studio to start working on their seventh studio album, planned for release in the spring of 2022.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/watain-signs-with-nuclear-blast-records-new-album-due-in-2022/|title=WATAIN Signs With NUCLEAR BLAST RECORDS; New Album Due In 2022|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=November 17, 2021|date=August 5, 2021}}</ref> The band will support this album by co-headlining US tour with [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/mayhem-and-watain-announce-march-april-2022-north-american-tour/|title=MAYHEM And WATAIN Announce March/April 2022 North American Tour|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=November 17, 2021|date=November 15, 2021}}</ref>

''[[Allmusic]]'' journalist Eduardo Rivadavia wrote that their debut album ''Rabid Death's Curse'' "suggested that Watain were, at best, content to produce intentionally crude facsimiles of inspirational forefathers ranging from Bathory to Mayhem and, at worst, unable to do anything else" but "fulfills an important function in Watain's career arc, one that the casual listener need never pay heed to, but which loyal fans will likely want to explore at some point in order to better comprehend all that followed".<ref>Eduardo Rivadavia: [http://www.allmusic.com/album/rabid-deaths-curse-mw0000799608 ''Rabid Death's Curse – Watain''], Retrieved 14 March 2013.</ref> Ronald Ziegler of the German ''Horrible Eyes'' [[fanzine]] described the album's sound as "very Swedish, very [[Death metal|Death Metalish]]".<ref name=heint /> According to Rivadavia, the second album ''Casus Luciferi'' sounds less Norwegian and more Swedish than earlier efforts.<ref>Eduardo Rivadavia: [http://www.allmusic.com/album/casus-luciferi-mw0001074780 ''Casus Luciferi – Watain''], Retrieved 14 March 2013.</ref> ''Sworn to the Dark'' "adds a lot of really catchy and melodic riffs and some cool guitar counter-melodies" to "droning guitars and frantic [[blast beat]]s"; the vocals "fall somewhere in between black and death metal.

According to Danielsson, ''Lawless Darkness'' is based more upon Watain themselves than other bands and was compared to Bathory, [[Master's Hammer]], [[Fields of the Nephilim]] and [[Deep Purple]].<ref>Götz Kühnemund: ''For those about to destroy – we salute you!''.

Watain identify themselves as [[Theistic Satanism|theistic Satanists]]. All lyrics, unless contributed by members of other bands, are written by vocalist Erik Danielsson,<ref name=diso /> who summed up their topics as "the religion they are based upon, [[Satanism]], or – to avoid confusion – [[Theistic Satanism|Devilworship]]".<ref name=heint /> Danielsson believes that a belief system shared by all members "is a must in order to do something as intimate and personal as music".<ref>terrybezer: [http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/unpublished-watain-interview-extras/ ''Unpublished Watain Interview Extras!''], 27 March 2009, Retrieved 21 November 2012.</ref> Watain supports the [[Misanthropic Luciferian Order]], [[Jon Nödtveidt]]'s cult which is [[Keillers Park murder|associated with animal abuse and murder.]]<ref name=metalde /><ref>Pete Woods: [http://www.metalteamuk.net/interview-watain.htm ''Interview with Watain''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121223234030/http://www.metalteamuk.net/interview-watain.htm |date=23 December 2012 }}, Retrieved 14 March 2013.</ref>

However, the band have publicly distanced themselves from, and openly criticised, [[Antisemitism]] and [[Far-right politics|far-right]] ideologies, describing these as "one of the greatest evils that people today know". Danielsson said that "That is the one thing you cannot glorify. The Anti-Semitic and right-wing conservative connections that people have long accused black metal to be a platform for have very little to do with what we stand for. To me, it should be quite obvious that we would have been some of the first people to be executed in the Third Reich with the whole idea of the National Socialists being based upon a kingdom of bright-eyed little Aryans, and we are quite honestly the very opposite of that. [Laughs] There's an extremely important line to draw there, and I've realized that that's the only devil that people know these days." He explicitly rejected "racial ideas" as "irrelevant", saying that "I study other cultures, and I am very interested in radical ideas of viewing the world, but when it comes to racial ideas, I've never really found a speech or text about it that could make sense to me. When we view the world from a spiritual perspective, racial ideas become very mundane, and they become very insignificant. We are talking about an animal that developed into man and that is, to me, where my primary enemy lies. Not in any specific kind of that animal.

The guitarist later blamed it on changes in immigration policy.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Blabbermouth|date=21 November 2019|title=WATAIN Guitarist Denied Entry To U.S.; Band Blames 'TRUMP-Administered Border Policy'|url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/watain-guitarist-denied-entry-to-u-s-band-blames-trump-administered-border-policy/|access-date=27 August 2020|website=Blabbermouth.net}}</ref>

== Live performances and allegations of animal abuse ==
Watain has been known to perform live using candles, pyrotechnics, and, akin to numerous black metal acts, limbs and bones of animal carcasses.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://throughthelensmagazine.com/2015/01/mayhem-and-watain-house-of-blues-dallas/|title=Mayhem and Watain, The Royale, Boston|website=Throughthelensmagazine.com|date=22 January 2015|access-date=8 October 2020}}</ref><ref>[http://ww1.ilistensoyoudonthaveto.com/] {{dead link|date=October 2020}}</ref> The band gained notoriety doing this and even dousing audience members with animal blood (which is part of the normal Watain Ritual) in a show at the Brooklyn Night Bazaar in 2014, reportedly causing some attendees to vomit.<ref>[http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/06/17/st-started-to-get-weird-fans-reportedly-begin-crying-and-vomiting-after-satanist-band-does-something-unbelievably-grotesque/] {{dead link|date=October 2020}}</ref><ref>[http://noisey.vice.com/blog/watain-live-review-brooklyn] {{dead link|date=October 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/watain-bloody-good-time-brooklyn/|title=Watain Bring a Bloody Good Time to Brooklyn|website=Loudwire.com|access-date=8 October 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/watain-frontman-drenches-crowd-with-animal-blood-at-brooklyn-concert-video/|title=WATAIN Frontman 'Drenches Crowd' With Animal Blood At Brooklyn Concert (Video)|date=17 June 2014|website=Blabbermouth.net|access-date=8 October 2020}}</ref> This soon garnered attention on [[TMZ]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tmz.com/2014/06/17/waitain-pigs-blood-metal-band-video-swedish-black-metal/|title=Swedish Metal Band Hurls Pigs Blood Into Audience ...

On 7 March 2019, the band's concert in [[Singapore]] was canceled hours before the event was set to happen. This was authorised by the [[Info-communications Media Development Authority]] due to security concerns related to their lyrical content and previous concert events.<ref>"Swedish black metal band Watain's gig in Singapore cancelled due to 'security concerns'".
