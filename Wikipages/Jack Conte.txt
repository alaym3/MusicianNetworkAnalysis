On May 7, 2013, Conte announced the launch of [[Patreon]], a [[crowdfunding]] venture, together with co-founder Samuel Yam. According to Conte, the startup is "like a [[kickstarter]] for people who release stuff on a regular basis."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Conte|first=Jack|date=May 7, 2013|title=Pedals Music Video (featuring REAL robots) – Conte|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ02alEkbLw|access-date=August 2, 2020|website=YouTube|time=4:10}}</ref><ref name="wired">{{cite web|author=Tate|first=Ryan|date=October 22, 2013|title=The Next Big Thing You Missed: 'Eternal Kickstarter' Reinvents Indie Art|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/10/big-idea-patreon/|access-date=September 6, 2015|website=[[Wired (magazine)|WIRED]]}}</ref>

==Reception==
Much of Conte's work has been met with positive reviews, citing evocative lyrics in ''Sleep in Color''<ref name="maneater"/> and creative delivery of his videosongs.<ref name="antiquiet">{{cite web|last=Firecloud|first=Johnny|date=August 4, 2008|title=Breaking Ground With Jack Conte|url=http://www.antiquiet.com/interviews/2008/08/breaking-ground-with-jack-conte/|access-date=July 25, 2009|website=Antiquiet}}</ref> However, Conte's music was reviewed less favorably by Amplifier: "Hints of [[Conor Oberst]], [[Radiohead]], [[Patrick Watson (musician)|Patrick Watson]], contemporary punk rock ([[screamo]]), radio [[power pop]], and incalculable other singer songwriters are more than borrowed, making for a short mishmash of [[Electronic rock|electro rock]]."<ref name="amplifier">{{cite web|last=Ferron|first=David|date=January 12, 2009|title=Jack Conte – Sleep in Color EP|url=http://www.amplifiermagazine.com/reviews/cds/jack_conte_cd_ep.php|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111111311/http://amplifiermagazine.com/reviews/cds/jack_conte_cd_ep.php|archive-date=November 11, 2011|access-date=March 2, 2014|website=Amplifier}}</ref>
