On February 17 they announced an outdoor festival called THE MISSION to celebrate this milestone;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/MWAMjapan/photos/a.482042758481030/3041405789211368/|title=MAN WITH A MISSION Facebook|access-date= July 4, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://themission.mwam10th.com/|title=THE MISSION|access-date= July 4, 2020|language=ja}}</ref> unfortunately due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] they were forced to cancel the festival.
