'''Hatebreed''' is an American [[metalcore]] band from [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], formed in 1994. The band released its debut album ''[[Satisfaction is the Death of Desire]]'' in 1997, which gave the band a [[cult following]]. The band signed to [[Universal Records]] and released ''[[Perseverance (Hatebreed album)|Perseverance]]'' in 2002, which hit the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Combining elements of [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], the band is often described as a [[metalcore]], [[hardcore punk]], and [[beatdown hardcore]] band. They have played a major role in the Connecticut hardcore scene.

== History ==
Hatebreed was formed in 1994 in Bridgeport, Connecticut. They began by recording a three song demo and selling it to locals. Those three songs would eventually be released on a split [[7"]] with New York's Neglect in 1995. They followed that with the highly acclaimed EP ''[[Under the Knife (EP)|Under the Knife]]'' scheduled to come out on Big Wheel Recreation in 1995 but then was self-released 1996, and went out on tour around the east coast/midwest supporting UKHC band [[Voorhees (band)|Voorhees]].<ref name="Glasper 2012">{{cite book |last1=Glasper |first1=Ian |title=ARMED WITH ANGER: HOW UK PUNK SURVIVED THE NINETIES |date=July 1, 2012 |publisher=Cherry Red Books}}</ref> The following year they released ''[[Satisfaction Is the Death of Desire]]'' on [[Victory Records]], then the home of some of the biggest bands in American hardcore. ''Satisfaction'' sold more copies than any other debut in the history of the record company.

Tours with national [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands such as [[Slayer]], [[Deftones]], [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]] and [[Napalm Death]] influenced their music and brought them to the attention of many non-hardcore fans. These influences were apparent on the band's next two releases, 2002's ''[[Perseverance (Hatebreed album)|Perseverance]]'', and especially 2003's ''[[The Rise of Brutality]]''.

After the release of ''The Rise of Brutality'', the band took part in the 2004 [[The Unholy Alliance (tour)|Unholy Alliance]] tour in Europe with [[Slayer]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] and [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]]. In June 2006, Hatebreed went on an extensive European tour which included a performance at the [[Download Festival]] in Castle Donington, UK. Immediately following this European tour, they played the main stage at [[Ozzfest]] 2006 alongside [[DragonForce]], [[Lacuna Coil]], [[Avenged Sevenfold]], [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]], and co-headliners [[System of a Down]].

The band's fourth album, ''[[Supremacy (Hatebreed album)|Supremacy]]'', was released in August 2006, their first through [[Roadrunner Records]], featuring new guitarist Frank Novinec (who had previously spent time playing with [[Ringworm (band)|Ringworm]], [[Terror (band)|Terror]], and [[Integrity (band)|Integrity]]). Jasta described it as an "all-out onslaught of completely adrenaline-charged, in-your-face brutality".<ref>{{cite news|title=Blabbermouth.net&nbsp;— HATEBREED Frontman Says New CD Is 'An All-Out Onslaught of In-Your-Face Brutality'|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=51568|access-date=April 10, 2007|date=April 28, 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BVr6ozPL?url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=51568|archive-date=October 18, 2012}}</ref>

Hatebreed headlined the second stage on the 2007 [[Ozzfest]] tour.  Hatebreed appeared at [[Wacken Open Air]] festival in 2008 alongside [[Iron Maiden]], [[Children of Bodom]], and [[Avantasia]]. In April 2008, Hatebreed signed a worldwide deal with [[Koch Records]] for the release of their live DVD, a live album, and a cover album entitled ''[[For the Lions]]'', which was released on May 5. On September 2, they released their concert DVD, entitled ''Live Dominance''.
