==Career==
New Jersey R&B trio Total made their first appearance singing the hook on [[The Notorious B.I.G.]]'s debut single, "[[Juicy (The Notorious B.I.G. song)|Juicy]]".<ref name="Larkin90"/> Garnering attention for the new group, they were also featured on the original version and "Hip Hop Remix" of his next single "One More Chance". They then immediately hit the studio with [[Bad Boy Records]] CEO [[Sean "Puffy" Combs]] and began work on their debut album. The first single "[[Can't You See (Total song)|Can't You See?]]" first appeared on the soundtrack to 1995 motion picture, ''[[New Jersey Drive]]''. The song featured [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] and peaked at number 13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] as well as #2 on the R&B Chart.<ref name="Larkin90"/> Their [[Total (Total album)|self-titled debut album]] was released nearly a year after the single. Total produced two more R&B top ten singles including:  "[[No One Else (single)|No One Else]]" (and its remix featuring [[Lil' Kim]],  [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]],  and [[Da Brat]]) and '"Kissing You" (and its remix featuring [[Sean "Puffy" Combs]]).<ref name="Larkin90"/> The album was certified platinum by the [[RIAA]].

While recording their second album, they appeared on numerous top ten singles, including [[LL Cool J]]'s "Loungin'/Who Do U Love?", [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]]'s "I Can't", and [[Mase]]'s "What You Want" featuring Keisha Epps, and Pamela Long sung the chorus on the hit "[[Hypnotize (The Notorious B.I.G. song)|Hypnotize]]" by The Notorious B.I.G. The group also released another single, the [[Missy Elliott]] and [[Timbaland]] track "[[What About Us? (Total song)|What About Us?]]" from the ''[[Soul Food (film)|Soul Food]]'' soundtrack.

Their follow-up album, ''[[Kima, Keisha, and Pam]]'',<ref name="Larkin90"/> debuted to strong reviews, sales, and was certified gold by the [[RIAA]]. The first single, another [[Missy Elliott]] collaboration, "[[Trippin' (Total song)|Trippin']]", reached the top ten of the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart.<ref name="Larkin90"/> Their next release, "Sitting Home", which made Top 10 of the [[Billboard R&B Singles|''Billboard'' R&B Singles]] did not garner the same attention. While in heavy rotation on video networks like BET, radio chose not to play the song. A remix of the track featured rap artist [[Shyne]].

After the release of ''Kima, Keisha, and Pam'', the girls sang the chorus to rap duo [[Gang Starr]]'s 1999 single "Discipline" and, in 2000, they were featured on the [[Tony Touch]] single "(I Wonder Why) He's the Greatest DJ". They also contributed to the songs "Crave" to ''[[3 Strikes (film)|3 Strikes]]'' and the songs "Quick Rush" to ''[[Bait (2000 film)|Bait]]'' movie soundtrack.

In their last official appearance together, they were thanked in the credits for their collaboration with [[Da Beatminerz]] and [[Talib Kweli]] - ''Anti-Love Movement'' in 2001 from their album ''[[Brace 4 Impak]]''.
