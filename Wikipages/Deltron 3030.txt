==History==

===''Deltron 3030''===
{{Main article|Deltron 3030 (album)}}
The group's debut album ''Deltron 3030'', released on October 17, 2000, is a [[concept album]] set in the year [[31st century|3030]] that tells of the dualistic conflict of fatalism that takes place between the moral concepts of "righteousness" and "malevolence." The story tells a prophetic tale of a warrior's thirst for battle as Del's alter ego, who goes by the name "Deltron-Zero," along with his comrade who happens to be a time-traveling cyborg wizard named "the Automator," face-off against megalithic corporations that megalomaniacally rule over our thermodynamic universe. The lyrics were written in less than two weeks and are characterized by extravagant allusions to futuristic outer-space themes in the tradition of [[Afrofuturism|Afrofuturist]] works by [[Sun Ra]] and [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]]. Many samples originated with the contemporary French classical  composer [[William Sheller]].
