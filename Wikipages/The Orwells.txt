==History==
=== ''Remember When'' ===
The Orwells formed when all the members attended York High School in Elmhurst, Illinois. The band was discovered in late 2011 by Aquarium Drunkard blogger Justin Gage, who signed them to his Autumn Tone label imprint.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.AquariumDrunkard.com |title=Aquarium Drunkard|website=Aquariumdrunkard.com|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> They graduated high school early in 2013 to pursue their musical career.<ref name="Lo-Pie">{{cite web|last=Timony|first=Mariana|title=Interview: The Orwells|url=http://lo-pie.com/interview-the-orwells/ |website=Lo-Pie.com |access-date=January 7, 2013}}</ref>

The Orwells were named as one of the overlooked artists of 2012 in [[MTV]]'s annual list.<ref>{{cite web|last=MTV|title=The Most Criminally Overlooked Artists of 2012 |url=http://buzzworthy.mtv.com/2012/12/07/overlooked-artists-music-under-the-radar-2012/ |publisher=MTV |access-date=January 13, 2013}}</ref> Their single "Mallrats (La La La)" was also reviewed by music website ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Minsker|first=Evan|title=The Orwells: Mallrats (La La La)|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13909-mallrats-la-la-la/|publisher=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |access-date=January 13, 2013}}</ref> They performed at [[Lollapalooza]] in August 2013. On November 5, 2013, The Orwells appeared on ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03hdkc6 |title=BBC Two - Later... with Jools Holland, Series 43 Live, Episode 8 |website=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-11-05 |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> On November 22, 2013, [[Arctic Monkeys]] announced that The Orwells would be their support at nine American concerts in January and February 2014.<ref name="monkeys">{{cite web|url=http://www.arcticmonkeys.com/news.php?id=632|title=2014 US Tour Support|date=November 22, 2013|website=Arcticmonkeys.com|access-date=November 23, 2013}}</ref>

=== ''Disgraceland'' ===
On March 24, 2014, The Orwells announced their new studio album ''Disgraceland'' through social media outlets. The album was released on June 3, 2014, and includes singles such as “Who Needs You” and “Dirty Sheets”.<ref name="npr.org">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2013/08/02/208298923/new-music-elf-power-bill-callahan-fka-twigs-more |title=New Music: Elf Power, Bill Callahan, FKA Twigs, More |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=August 6, 2013 |access-date=November 23, 2013}}</ref>

The song "Who Needs You" was featured on the August 6, 2013, episode of [[NPR]]'s ''[[All Songs Considered]]''. Co-host Bob Boilen said "You can't say The Orwells without saying 'young'" and called the song his summer anthem.<ref name="npr.org" />

The Orwells performed on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' January 15, 2014.<ref>{{cite episode | series = [[Late Show with David Letterman]] | network = [[CBS]] | airdate = January 15, 2014}}</ref> Their performance was enthusiastically received, so much that Letterman and others called for an encore. The band did not respond, partly because guitarist Matt O'Keefe had broken all of his strings and physically could not play. After waiting for the Orwells, the [[CBS Orchestra|house band]] reprised the Orwells' song and [[Paul Shaffer]] parodied the way that Mario Cuomo had lain on his back, thrashing.

On September 25, 2014, the band was featured on an episode of ''[[Adam Devine's House Party]]'', performing their single "Who Needs You".

On December 7, 2014, the prospering note "Who Needs You" was found in an [[Apple Inc.]] commercial for the iPad Air 2, "Change is in the Air." This track was also to be later found in a [[Rockstar Games]] video game, "[[Grand Theft Auto V]]" on one of the in-game Rock N' Roll stations.

=== Accusations of sexual abuse ===
On September 10, 2018, Consequence of Sound published a series of allegations made by nine women who accused members of the band of serious instances of sexual abuse:

"“The Orwells’ abuse was not only a well-known scene secret, but it was something that happened to so many women WITHIN the scene. Girlfriends of band members, friends of girlfriends of band members, to the women that are in the front row every show, etc.,” ... “People were SO close to the abuse. They saw what happened to their friends and knew these awful dudes lived nearby. I think they didn’t want to start even more trouble.”"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/09/female-fans-use-social-media-to-expose-the-orwells-allegations/|title=Female Fans Use Social Media to Expose The Orwells' Allegations|date=2018-09-10|website=Consequence of Sound|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-15}}</ref>

Such allegations had been raised on Reddit and Twitter against Cuomo and the Brinner brothers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/9ah2ql/3_members_of_the_orwells_have_received_multiple/|website=Reddit r/indieheads|date=26 August 2018|access-date=2018-08-31|title=3 members of The Orwells have received multiple accusations of sexual misconduct and homophobia}}</ref> The range of allegations include rape, statutory rape, and sending unsolicited nude photos.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/08/the-orwells-sexual-assault-response/|title=The Orwells respond to sexual assault accusations, cancel Chicago show|date=2018-08-28|work=Consequence of Sound|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en-US}}</ref> The Orwells issued a statement to ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine denying allegations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/the-orwells-issue-statement-about-sexual-abuse-allegations/|title=The Orwells Issue Statement About Sexual Abuse Allegations|website=Pitchfork.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}</ref>

=== Post-split ===
On June 15, 2019, Mario Cuomo released the self-titled fourth studio album by The Orwells onto his YouTube channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/06/the-orwells-new-album/|title=The Orwells quietly release new album less than a year after breakup|last1=Young|first1=Alex|date=June 15, 2019|website=Consequence of Sound|access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref>

=== Fifth Album ===

As of early to mid 2020, speculations of a fifth album release were confirmed via Mario’s Instagram account, along with footage of the band back together working on new material.

== Musical influence ==
Several band members have expressed a love for [[the Supremes]] in interviews.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/new-music/10571377/The-Orwells-New-Music.html|title=The Orwells - New Music|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-05-11|language=en}}</ref>

The lead singer, Mario Cuomo, is heavily influenced by six distinctly different performers; [[Iggy Pop]], [[Jay Reatard]], [[Julian Casablancas]], Cole Alexander and Jared Swilley of the [[Black Lips]], Pelle Almqvist of [[the Hives]], and [[Tyler, The Creator|Tyler, the Creator]]—particularly Tyler's talk about skipping class, disobeying parents, and going to record. Mario is quoted saying that, "It like spoke to me even more than any other music I was listening to. I think if it wasn’t for him, I probably wouldn’t have had the balls to drop out or even be in a band."<ref name="radio.com">{{cite web|url=http://radio.com/2014/06/23/6-frontman-that-inspired-the-orwells-mario-cuomo/|title=6 Frontmen Who Inspired The Orwells' Mario Cuomo|website=Radio.com|access-date=2017-05-11}}</ref>
