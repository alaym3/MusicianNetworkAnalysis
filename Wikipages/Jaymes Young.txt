On May 11, 2018, McFarland said he was stepping away from the Jaymes Young project, saying on his [[Facebook]] "I'm taking a possibly permanent break from Jaymes Young as a project. I'll be back somehow someway... I can promise that. I owe a lot more music to those who have supported me. I'm following the path I feel is best. Thanks for listening."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/jaymesyoungmusic/posts/1547663518665200|title=Jaymes Young|via=Facebook|language=en|access-date=May 12, 2018}}</ref>
