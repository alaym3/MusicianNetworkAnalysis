Several of his tracks were featured in the 2012 game ''[[Hotline Miami]]'' and its 2015 sequel ''[[Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number]]''. Perturbator's EP ''Sexualizer'' was released in part to officially release the song "Miami Disco" and as a way to thank the developers of ''Hotline Miami''.<ref>[http://small-talkings.blogspot.com/2014/01/perturbator-james-kent.html/ Small Talk: Perturbator (James Kent)].

Perturbator released his fourth full-length album ''The Uncanny Valley'' on 6 May 2016 through Blood Music on a range of formats including Digibook CD, vinyl, and cassette tape. The album was met with generally positive reviews, with [[MetalSucks]] and [[Bloody Disgusting]] both writing in praise of it. Some versions of the album also included a bonus EP, with Kent writing that "The first three songs complement the themes covered within ''The Uncanny Valley'', and the final track—'VERS/US'—is a demo from ''The Uncanny Valley'' writing sessions that fits the mood and atmosphere of the album but didn't quite make it into the final cut."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Perturbator/photos/pb.375849962447174.-2207520000.1457165522./1178808385484657/?type=3|title=Perturbator – Perturbator "The Uncanny Valley – Bonus" EP... {{!}} Facebook|date=February 26, 2016|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=May 5, 2016}}</ref> Bloody Disgusting gave the album 5/5 and wrote that ''The Uncanny Valley'' "is sure to not only please fans of the genre but also win over newcomers."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/music/3389996/perturbators-uncanny-valley-sheer-synth-bliss-album-review/|title=Perturbator's 'The Uncanny Valley' is Sheer Synth Bliss (Album Review) – Bloody Disgusting!|last=Barkan|first=Jonathan|date=2016-05-05|website=Bloody Disgusting!|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-05}}</ref>

Kent became interested in music in part due to the influence of his parents, who are journalists and rock music critics.<ref>[http://discounchained.blogspot.se/2013/07/interview-with-james-kent-perturbator.html "Interview with James Kent (Perturbator)"]. Disco Unchained. Retrieved 19 July 2013.</ref> His parents were themselves musicians and had a [[tech trance]] band when they were young, which influenced Kent to take an interest in synthesizers.

Kent also has a side project called L'Enfant De La Forêt<ref>[http://www.metalinjection.net/av/did-you-know-perturbators-james-kent-has-a-creepy-industrialambient-type-project/ "Did You Know PERTURBATOR's James Kent Has A Creepy Industrial/Ambient Type Project?"] Metal Injection. Retrieved 14 January 2015.</ref> and his own label called "Music of the Void".

In 2019 Kent appeared in the documentary film ''[[The Rise of the Synths]]'', appearing alongside various other composers from the Synthwave scene, including filmmaker [[John Carpenter]] who also narrated the film which explored the origins and growth of the genre.
