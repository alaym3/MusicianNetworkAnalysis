'''Amber Run''' is a British [[indie rock]] band from [[Nottingham]], UK composed of Joshua "Joe" Keogh, Tom Sperring, and Henry Wyeth. The band have released three albums and four EPs. Initially called '''Amber''', they later changed their name to avoid conflict with the German dance-pop [[Amber (singer)|singer]] of same name.<ref name=":0" />

==History==

===Formation===
Joshua Keogh, Tom Sperring and Will Jones were originally friends from [[Buckinghamshire]] at Dr Challoner's Grammar School where they played in an alt rock band. With Felix Archer from the same area and Wyeth from Kent, they met while studying at [[University of Nottingham]].<ref name="nottinghampost">{{cite web|url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/grief-saying-Nottingham-band-Amber-Run/story-23020931-detail/story.html|title="We get grief for saying we're a Nottingham band" – Amber Run|publisher=nottinghampost.com|author=Nottingham Post|date=1 October 2014|access-date=7 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141004060617/http://www.nottinghampost.com/grief-saying-Nottingham-band-Amber-Run/story-23020931-detail/story.html|archive-date=4 October 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> They all studied for degrees in Humanities and Law, but abandoned their studies in second year to focus on the band.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url = http://www.nottinghampost.com/Green-light-Amber-run-pop-success/story-20267104-detail/story.html|title = Green light for Amber run at pop success|date = 5 December 2013|website = Notthingham Post|author = Staff Writer|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131208000251/http://www.nottinghampost.com/Green-light-Amber-run-pop-success/story-20267104-detail/story.html|archive-date = 8 December 2013|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Keogh initially performed under his own name and started to get 'a bit of momentum [so] we sat down and jammed out one day and there was something about it. It was so much better than what I was doing solo, so we started a band'.<ref name=":0" />

Thanks to local BBC presenter Dean Jackson the band featured on the [[BBC Introducing]] stage at [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading Festival]] in 2013 was only the fourth show the band played.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/artists/0070ca77-26e8-4ce2-a28a-d1b76ec15485|title=Amber Run|work=BBC Music}}</ref> Their presence attracted a number of A&R men to the show and after a few weeks of negotiating the band signed to RCA.<ref name=":0" />

===2014–2015: ''Noah'' and debut album===
On 14 February 2014, they released their first EP titled ''Noah'' which consisted of 4 songs.

In March 2014, the band announced they had been recording their debut album throughout January and February 2014 with [[Mike Crossey]] and Sam Winfield, "who's in many ways the sixth member of our band".<ref name=iammusictv/>

In July and August 2014 the band released videos for the single "I Found" and "Pilot", respectively, that are a duology. Speaking to LeftLion Magazine in December 2014, they explained: "We were already discussing what to do with it [I Found]; it's not a song that screams "single" but we wanted to release it in some form. Releasing it with "Pilot" just seemed to be a good method to bring attention to the whole EP, and doing something creative with the videos is a bit more interesting. Linking the videos gives you more scope... [to] expand the storyline past three and a half minutes."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.leftlion.co.uk/articles.cfm/id/7154/title/amber-run|title=Amber Run - LeftLion|last=Blakemore|first=Penny|website=www.leftlion.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-04-27}}</ref>

On 1 December 2014, Amber Run announced their new single "Just My Soul Responding". The song was confirmed as the lead single taken from the band’s upcoming debut. In regards to their debut album front singer, Joshua Keogh said the "album is done and we've signed it off.
