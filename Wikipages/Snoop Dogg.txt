'''Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr.''' (born October 20, 1971), known professionally as '''Snoop Dogg''' (previously '''Snoop Doggy Dogg''' and briefly '''Snoop Lion'''),{{efn|Earlier in his career, he frequently referred to himself as "Snoop Rock". Other names that he has released music under include "DJ Snoopadelic", "Snoopzilla", "Bigg Snoop Dogg", and simply "Snoop".|group=note}} is an American rapper, songwriter, media personality, actor, and businessman. His fame dates to 1992 when he featured on [[Dr. Dre]]'s debut solo single, "[[Deep Cover (song)|Deep Cover]]", and then on Dre's debut solo album, ''[[The Chronic]]''. Broadus has since sold over 23 million albums in the United States and 35 million albums worldwide.<ref name="Sales">{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_RxMEAAAAMBAJ |page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_RxMEAAAAMBAJ/page/n24 25] |quote=Snoop's Upside Ya Head soundscan. |title=Billboard Magazine Match 1, 2008 - pág 25 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]  |access-date=July 28, 2015|date=March 1, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/um-dia-com-o-rapper-snoop-dogg-1440648328|title=Um dia com o rapper Snoop Dogg|first=Christopher|last=Ross|date=August 27, 2015|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=October 5, 2017}}</ref>

Broadus' debut solo album, ''[[Doggystyle]],'' produced by Dr. Dre, was released by [[Death Row Records]] in November 1993, and debuted at number one on the popular albums chart, the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart. Selling 800,000 copies in its first week, ''Doggystyle'' was [[RIAA certification|certified]] quadruple-platinum in 1994 and bore several hit singles, including "[[What's My Name? (Snoop Doggy Dogg song)|What's My Name?]]" and "[[Gin & Juice]]". In 1994, Death Row Records released a soundtrack, by Broadus, for the short film ''[[Murder Was the Case]],'' starring Snoop. In 1996, his second album, ''[[Tha Doggfather]],'' also debuted at number one on both charts, with "[[Snoop's Upside Ya Head]]" as the lead single. The next year, the album was certified double-platinum.

After leaving Death Row Records in January 1998, Broadus signed with [[No Limit Records]], releasing three Snoop albums: ''[[Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told|Da Game is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told]]'' (1998), ''[[No Limit Top Dogg]]'' (1999), and ''[[Tha Last Meal]]'' (2000). In 2002, he signed with [[Priority Records|Priority]]/[[Capitol Records|Capitol]]/[[EMI|EMI Records]], releasing ''[[Paid tha Cost to Be da Boss]]''. In 2004, he signed to [[Geffen Records]], releasing his next three albums: ''[[R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece]],'' then ''[[Tha Blue Carpet Treatment]],'' and ''[[Ego Trippin']]''. Priority Records released his album ''[[Malice 'n Wonderland]]'' during 2009, followed by ''[[Doggumentary]]'' during 2011. Snoop Dogg has starred in motion pictures and hosted several television shows, including ''[[Doggy Fizzle Televizzle]],'' ''[[Snoop Dogg's Father Hood]],'' and ''[[Dogg After Dark]]''. He also coaches a youth football league and high-school football team. In September 2009, EMI hired him as the chairman of a reactivated Priority Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=56810 |title=Snoop Dogg Resurrects Priority Records |publisher=XXLmag.com |access-date=June 20, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108202931/http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=56810 |archive-date=November 8, 2010}}</ref>

In 2012, after a trip to Jamaica, Broadus announced a conversion to [[Rastafari]] and a new alias, Snoop Lion. As Snoop Lion he released a [[reggae]] album, ''[[Reincarnated (album)|Reincarnated]],'' and a [[Reincarnated (film)|documentary film of the same name]], about his Jamaican experience, in early 2013. His 13th studio album, [[Bush (album)|''Bush,'']] was released in May 2015 and marked a return of the Snoop Dogg name. His 14th solo studio album, ''[[Coolaid]],'' was released in July 2016. Snoop has had 17 [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]] nominations without a win. In March 2016, the night before [[WrestleMania 32]] in [[Arlington, Texas]], he was inducted into the celebrity wing of the [[WWE Hall of Fame]], having made several appearances for the company, including as master of ceremonies during a match at [[WrestleMania XXIV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwe-hall-fame/wwe-hall-fame-2016/article/snoop-dogg-celebrity-inductee-wwe-hall-fame-2016|title=Snoop Dogg to be inducted into WWE Hall of Fame|website=Wwe.com|access-date=April 25, 2016}}</ref> In 2018, Snoop announced that he was "a born-again Christian" and released his first [[Gospel music|gospel]] album ''[[Bible of Love]]''.<ref name=BAC>{{cite web|title=Snoop Dogg Responds To Criticism Of Gospel Album: 'Are You Going To Heaven? |website = [[YouTube]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7QRq0b_6hg |access-date=October 4, 2019 |date=March 30, 2018}}</ref> On November 19, 2018, Snoop Dogg was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.<ref name="brooklynvegan1">{{Cite news|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/snoop-dogg-getting-a-hollywood-walk-of-fame-star-touring-with-bone-thugs/|title=Snoop Dogg getting a Hollywood Walk of Fame star, touring with Bone Thugs|work=BrooklynVegan|access-date=November 16, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> He released his seventeenth solo album, ''[[I Wanna Thank Me]]'', in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2019/08/snoop-dogg-i-wanna-thank-me-stream|title=Listen to Snoop Dogg's 'I Wanna Thank Me' Album f/ Mustard, Rick Ross, and More|last=Espinoza|first=Joshua|publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=August 16, 2019|access-date=August 17, 2019}}</ref>

His mother and stepfather divorced in 1975.<ref name="wargs.com" /> When Broadus was very young, he began singing and playing piano at the Golgotha Trinity Baptist Church. In sixth grade, he began rapping.<ref name="NY Times 1993 Growl">{{cite news | author=Toure| title = Snoop Dogg's Gentle Hip-Hop Growl| url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFDB133DF932A15752C1A965958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all| work=The New York Times | date = November 21, 1993 | access-date =April 24, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/snoop%20unveils%20church.going%20past| title= Snoop unveils church going past|date=November 3, 2004}}</ref> As a child, Broadus sold candy, delivered newspapers, and bagged groceries to help his family make ends meet. He was described as having been a dedicated student and enthusiastic churchgoer, active in choir and football. Broadus said in 1993 that he began engaging in unlawful activities and joining gangs in his teenage years, despite his mother's preventative efforts.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-snoopphilips7nov0793-story.html|title=The saga of Snoop Doggy Dogg|date=November 7, 1993|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=August 30, 2019}}</ref>

Broadus would frequently rap in school. As he recalled: "When I rapped in the hallways at school I would draw such a big crowd that the principal would think there was a fight going on. It made me begin to realize that I had a gift. I could tell that my raps interested people and that made me interested in myself."<ref name=":0" />

As a teenager, Broadus frequently ran into trouble with the law. He was a member of the Rollin' 20s [[Crips]] gang in the [[Eastside, Long Beach, California|Eastside]] neighborhood of Long Beach;<ref name="Most Lovable Pimp">{{cite magazine|author=Toure|title=America's Most Lovable Pimp|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/12676363/cover_story_americas_most_lovable_pimp/print| magazine= [[Rolling Stone]] |date= December 14, 2006|url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621111652/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/12676363/cover_story_americas_most_lovable_pimp/print| archive-date=June 21, 2008}}</ref> although in 1993 he denied the frequent police and media reports by saying that he never joined a gang.<ref name="NY Times 1993 Growl"/> Shortly after graduating from high school at [[Long Beach Polytechnic High School]] in 1989, he was arrested for possession of cocaine, and for the next three years, was frequently incarcerated, including at [[Peter J. Pitchess Detention Center|Wayside Jail]].<ref name="allmusicbio"/> With his two cousins [[Nate Dogg]] and Lil' ½ Dead and friend [[Warren G]], Snoop recorded homemade tapes; the four called their group [[213 (group)|213]] after the [[area code]] of their native Long Beach at that time. One of Snoop's early solo freestyles over "[[Hold On (En Vogue song)|Hold On]]" by [[En Vogue]] was on a [[mixtape]] that fortuitously wound up with [[Dr. Dre]]; the influential producer was so impressed by the sample that he called Snoop to audition. Former [[N.W.A]] affiliate [[The D.O.C.]] taught him to structure his lyrics and separate the themes into verses, hooks, and choruses.<ref name="Hip Hop Honours 2007">According to Snoop Dogg's memoirs, as told by himself in VH1 Hip Hop Honors 2007</ref>

==Musical career==
===1992–1998: Death Row, ''Doggystyle,'' and ''Tha Doggfather''===
When he began recording, Broadus took the stage name Snoop Doggy Dogg. [[Dr. Dre]] began working with him, first on the theme song of the 1992 film ''[[Deep Cover]]'' and then on Dr. Dre's debut solo album ''[[The Chronic]]'' along with the other members of his former starting group, [[Tha Dogg Pound]]. This intense exposure played a considerable part in making Snoop Dogg's debut album, ''[[Doggystyle]],'' the critical and commercial success that it was.<ref name="allmusicbio"/>

[[File:Snoop dog-02.jpg|thumb|right|Snoop Dogg in 1998]]
Fueling the ascendance of [[West Coast hip hop|West Coast]] [[G-funk]] hip hop, the singles "[[Who Am I (What's My Name)?]]" and "[[Gin and Juice]]" reached the top ten most-played songs in the United States, and the album stayed on the Billboard charts for several months.<ref name= allmusicbio /> [[Gangsta rap]] became the center of arguments about censorship and labeling, with Snoop Dogg often used as an example of violent and [[misogynistic]] musicians.<ref>{{cite news| last= Holden|first=Stephen|title=How Pop Music Lost the Melody|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E3DD143CF930A35754C0A962958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|date=July 3, 1994|access-date=July 4, 2008}}</ref> Unlike much of the harder-edged gangsta rap artists, Snoop Dogg seemed to show his softer side, according to music journalist [[Chuck Philips]]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' music critic [[Touré (journalist)|Touré]] asserted that Snoop had a relatively soft vocal delivery compared to other rappers: "Snoop's vocal style is part of what distinguishes him: where many rappers scream, figuratively and literally, he speaks softly."<ref name="NY Times 1993 Growl"/> ''Doggystyle,'' much like ''The Chronic,'' featured a host of rappers signed to or affiliated with the Death Row label including [[Daz Dillinger]], [[Kurupt]], [[Nate Dogg]], and others.

A short film about Snoop Dogg's murder trial, ''[[Murder Was the Case]],'' was released in 1994, along with an accompanying [[Murder Was the Case (soundtrack)|soundtrack]]. On July 6, 1995, [[Doggystyle Records|Doggy Style Records, Inc.]], a record label founded by Snoop Dogg, was registered with the [[California Secretary of State]] as business entity number C1923139.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://businessfilings.sos.ca.gov/frmDetail.asp?CorpID=01923139| title=California Secretary of State Business Search – Business Entities – Business Programs|access-date=November 7, 2010}}</ref>

Broadus was acquitted of his murder charge on February 20, 1996. According to Broadus, after he was acquitted he did not want to continue living the "gangsta" lifestyle, because he felt that continuing his behavior would result in his assassination or a prison term.<ref>{{Citation|last=Now What?|title=Snoop Dogg - #18 - Now What? with Arian Foster|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiVGxB7yO-k|access-date=December 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Daunt|first=Tina|title=Rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg Is Acquitted of Murder|url=https://www-latimes-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1996-02-21-mn-38322-story,amp.html?amp_js_v=a2&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQA#aoh=15604896005282&csi=1&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.latimes.com%2Farchives%2Fla-xpm-1996-02-21-mn-38322-story.html|date=February 21, 1996|access-date=June 13, 2019}}</ref>

After his acquittal, he, the mother of his son, and their kennel of 20 pit bulls moved into a {{convert|5000|ft2|m2|adj=on}} home in the hills of [[Claremont, California]] and by August 1996 Doggy Style Records, a subsidiary of [[Death Row Records]], signed [[the Gap Band]]'s [[Charlie Wilson (singer)|Charlie Wilson]] as one of its first artists.<ref>{{cite news |title= Trying to Get His Bite Back.

By the time Snoop Dogg's second album, ''[[Tha Doggfather]],'' was released in November 1996, the price of appearing to live the gangsta life had become very evident. Among the many notable hip hop industry deaths and convictions were the death of Snoop Dogg's friend and labelmate [[Tupac Shakur]] and the [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]] indictment of Death Row co-founder [[Suge Knight]].<ref name="allmusicbio"/> Dr. Dre had left Death Row earlier in 1996 because of a contract dispute, so Snoop Dogg co-produced ''Tha Doggfather'' with [[Daz Dillinger]] and [[DJ Pooh]].

This album featured a distinct change of style from ''Doggystyle,'' and the leadoff single, "[[Snoop's Upside Ya Head]]", featured a collaboration with Charlie Wilson. The album sold reasonably well but was not as successful as its predecessor. ''Tha Doggfather'' had a somewhat softer approach to the G-funk style. After Dr. Dre withdrew from Death Row Records, Snoop realized that he was subject to an ironclad time-based contract (i.e., that Death Row practically owned anything he produced for a number of years), and refused to produce any more tracks for [[Suge Knight]] other than the insulting "Fuck Death Row" until his contract expired.<ref name="Most Lovable Pimp"/> In an interview with [[Neil Strauss]] in 1998, Snoop Dogg said that though he had been given lavish gifts by his former label, they had withheld his royalty payments.<ref>Strauss, Neil. ''Everyone Loves You When You're Dead: Journeys into Fame and Madness.'' New York: HarperCollins, 2011, p. 12-13</ref>

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that after ''Tha Doggfather,'' Snoop Dogg began "moving away from his gangsta roots toward a calmer lyrical aesthetic":<ref name="allmusicbio"/> for instance, Snoop participated in the 1997 [[Lollapalooza]] concert tour, which featured mainly alternative rock music. Troy J. Augusto of ''Variety'' noticed that Snoop's set at Lollapalooza attracted "much dancing, and, strangely, even a small mosh pit" in the audience.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117906356.html?categoryid=31&cs=1|title=Lollapalooza 1997|last=Augusto|first=Troy J.|date=July 1, 1997|work=Variety|access-date=June 26, 2009}}</ref>

===1998–2006: Signing with No Limit and continued success===
[[File:Snoop Dogg Hawaii.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Snoop Dogg performs in Hawaii for U.S. military members in 2005]]

Snoop signed with [[Master P]]'s [[No Limit Records]] (distributed by [[Priority Records|Priority]]/[[EMI]] Records) in March 1998 and debuted on the label with ''[[Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told]]'' later that year. He said at the time that "Snoop Dogg is universal so he can fit into any camp-especially a camp that knows how to handmake shit[;] [a]nd, No Limit hand makes material. They make material fittin' to the artist and they know what type of shit Snoop Dogg is supposed to be on. That's why it's so tight."

In 2002, he released the album ''[[Paid tha Cost to Be da Bo$$]],'' on Priority/[[Capitol Records|Capitol]]/[[EMI]], selling over 1,310,000 copies. The album featured the hit singles "[[From tha Chuuuch to da Palace]]" and "[[Beautiful (Snoop Dogg song)|Beautiful]]", featuring guest vocals by [[Pharrell]]. By this stage in his career, Snoop Dogg had left behind his "[[gangster]]" image and embraced a "[[pimp]]" image.

In June 2004, Snoop signed to [[Geffen Records]]/[[Star Trak Entertainment]], both distributed by [[Interscope Records]]; Star Trak is headed by producer duo [[the Neptunes]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Snoop Signs With Neptunes For Next Step In Long Label Trek|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1488430/snoop-signs-with-neptunes-for-next-step-in-long-label-trek/|last=Archive-Joseph-Patel|website=MTV News|language=en|access-date=May 16, 2020}}</ref> which produced several tracks for Snoop's 2004 release ''[[R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece]]''. "[[Drop It Like It's Hot]]" (featuring Pharrell), the first single released from the album, was a hit and became Snoop Dogg's first single to reach number one. His third release was "[[Signs (Snoop Dogg song)|Signs]]", featuring [[Justin Timberlake]] and [[Charlie Wilson (musician)|Charlie Wilson]], which entered the UK chart at No. 2. This was his highest entry ever in the UK chart. The album sold 1,730,000 copies in the U.S. alone, and most of its singles were heavily played on radio and television. Snoop Dogg joined [[Warren G]] and [[Nate Dogg]] to form the group [[213 (group)|213]] and released ''[[The Hard Way (213 album)|The Hard Way]]'' in 2004. Debuting at No.4 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and No.1 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, it included the single "Groupie Luv". Snoop Dogg [[cameo appearance|appeared]] in the music video for [[Korn]]'s "[[Twisted Transistor]]" along with fellow rappers [[Lil Jon]], [[Xzibit]], and [[David Banner]],

Snoop Dogg appeared on two tracks from Ice Cube's 2006 album ''[[Laugh Now, Cry Later]],'' including "[[Go to Church]]", and on several tracks on [[Tha Dogg Pound]]'s ''Cali Iz Active'' the same year. His song "Real Talk" was leaked on the Internet in the summer of 2006 and a video was later released on the Internet. "Real Talk" was dedicated to former Crips leader [[Stanley Williams|Stanley "Tookie" Williams]] and a diss to [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], the governor of California. Two other singles on which Snoop made a guest performance were "Keep Bouncing" by [[Too $hort]] (also with [[will.i.am]] of [[the Black Eyed Peas]]) and "[[Gangsta Walk]]" by [[Coolio]].

Snoop Dogg, after performing for a concert in [[Uppsala]], Sweden on July 25, 2015, was pulled over and detained by Swedish police for allegedly using illegal drugs, violating a Swedish law enacted in 1988, which criminalized the recreational use of such substances – therefore making even being under the influence of any illegal/controlled substance a crime itself without possession. During the detention, he was taken to the police station to perform a drug test and was released shortly afterwards. The rapid test was positive for traces of narcotics, and he was potentially subject to fines depending on the results of more detailed analysis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelocal.se/20150731/snoop-doggs-initial-drug-test-positive-swedish-police |title=Snoop Dogg's initial drug test positive say police |website=TheLocal.se |date=July 31, 2015 |access-date=August 8, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Snoop Dogg Arrested in Sweden on Drug Suspicions, Alleges Racial Profiling|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6642085/snoop-dogg-arrested-in-sweden-on-drug-suspicions-alleges-racial|date=July 26, 2015|magazine=Billboard|access-date=May 16, 2020}}</ref> Although final results "strongly" indicated drug use, the charges were ultimately dropped because it could not be proven that he was in Sweden when he consumed the substances.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thelocal.se/20160108/snoop-dogg-wont-face-drug-charges-in-sweden |title=Snoop Dogg won't face drug charges in Sweden |website=TheLocal.se |date=January 8, 2016 |access-date=September 15, 2020}}</ref> The rapper uploaded several videos on the social networking site [[Instagram]], criticizing the police for alleged [[racial profiling]]; police spokesman Daniel Nilsson responded to the accusations, saying, "we don't work like that in Sweden."
