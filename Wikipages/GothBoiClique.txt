'''GothBoiClique''' (also abbreviated as '''GBC''') is an American [[emo rap]] collective based in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/gothboiclique-mn0003845274/biography|title=GothBoiClique: Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|first=Paul|last=Simpson|accessdate=December 5, 2019}}</ref> It was formed in 2013 by Wicca Phase Springs Eternal, Cold Hart, and Horse Head.<ref name=allmusic/> The group's name comes from a beat that Cold Hart sent to Wicca Phase Springs Eternal.<ref name=allmusic/> In 2016, the group released a mixtape, ''Yeah It's True''.<ref name=allmusic/>

In their full assembly the group consisted of 10 members, but currently only holds 8 due to the death of [[Lil Peep]] in 2017 and Horse Head's exiting in 2020. 

==History==
GBC was formed in 2012<ref name="MG">{{cite web |title=WATCH GOTHBOICLIQUE'S UNMASKED EPISODE |url=http://www.themaskedgorilla.com/gothboicliques-unmasked-video/ |access-date=21 February 2021}}</ref> through [[Wicca Phase Springs Eternal]] (WPSE) attempting to put together a group through [[Tumblr]] with the intention of forming a collective of musicians who could mutually collaborate with and produce for one another<ref name=vice>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ywkaby/inside-the-highly-strange-world-of-wicca-phase-springs-eternal|title=Inside the Highly Strange World of Wicca Phase Springs Eternal|website=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|first=Emma|last=Garland|date=September 6, 2018|accessdate=December 5, 2019}}</ref> and drawing connections between the emo, trap, [[dark wave]], [[black metal]] and [[indie rock]] scenes.<ref name="Revolver">{{cite web |last1=REEVES |first1=MOSI |title=WICCA PHASE SPRINGS ETERNAL: OCCULT GENRE-SMASHER BRED IN PUNK, BACKED BY CODE ORANGE |url=https://www.revolvermag.com/music/wicca-phase-springs-eternal-occult-genre-smasher-bred-punk-backed-code-orange |website=[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]] |date=6 August 2018 |access-date=20 February 2021}}</ref> The founding line-up consisted of Wicca Phase, Cold Hart and Horse Head,<ref>{{cite web |title=Gothboiclique (US) |date=25 March 2019 |url=https://fource.cz/en/events/gothboiclique-19/ |access-date=21 February 2021}}</ref> taking their name from a beat titled "Gothboiclique" that Cold Hart had produced, which when WPSE read the name he jokingly tweeted "RT if you’re goth boi clique".<ref name=vice /> The members of the group continued mostly independently for the next two years, despite continuing to gain members. In 2014, the members met each other in person, and soon after GBC became a sub-group of the newly founded hip hop collective Thraxxhouse,<ref name="MG" /> a [[Seattle]]-based offshoot of [[Raider Klan]].<ref name="Lil Tracy">{{cite web |last1=Greeley |first1=Shakeil |title=Lil Tracy Will Not Be Erased |url=https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/lil-tracy-will-not-be-erased/ |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=27 November 2018 |access-date=20 February 2021}}</ref> This led to [[Lil Tracy]] (then known as Yung Bruh) joining Thraxxhouse later on in 2014, and quickly became a fan of GBC. In a 2018 interview with [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]], he stated that he owned a secondhand GBC shirt that he wore "every day, to bed, in the morning, everywhere" and that he "looked up to Wicca Phase almost like on a [[Stan (fan)|stan]] level". He soon asked Horse Head to ask WPSE if he could join, who allowed, saying "Well, he wears the shirt enough!"<ref name="Lil Tracy" /> 

In 2015, Thraxxhouse broke up, however GBC continued to operate independently.<ref name="AllMusic">{{cite web |last1=Simpson |first1=Paul |title=GothBoiClique Biography by Paul Simpson |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/gothboiclique-mn0003845274/biography |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=21 February 2021}}</ref> On September 25, 2016, Lil Peep was announced that he had officially joined the group soon after the release of his ''Hellboy'' release.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=TENREYRO |first1=TATIANA |title=A Timeline of Lil Peep's Career  |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8039377/lil-peep-career-timeline |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=21 February 2021}}</ref> The group released their debut collective mixtape "Yeah it's True" on June 25, 2016.<ref name="BWW" /> On November 15, 2017, Lil Peep was found dead on his tour bus when his manager went to check on him in preparation for that night's performance at a [[Tucson]], [[Arizona]] venue.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lil Peep, hero to the emo and hip-hop scenes, dies of suspected overdose at 21|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-lil-peep-obituary-20171116-story.html|first=August|last=Brown|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=November 16, 2017|access-date=November 16, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, WPSE and GBC affiliates Lil Zubin, Jon Simmons, Nedarb, Fantasy Camp and Foxwedding formed Misery Club,<ref>{{cite web |last1=BATEMAN |first1=ALEXANDRA |title=Misery Club Releases Second EP, "Lost Inside the Night" |date=28 April 2019 |url=https://undergroundunderdogs.com/2019/04/28/misery-club-releases-second-ep-lost-inside-the-night/ |access-date=21 February 2021}}</ref> a sub-group of GBC.<ref name=vice /> In June 2019, GBC headlined a sold-out European tour.
