'''Café Tacuba''' (stylized '''Café Tacvba''') is a band from [[Ciudad Satélite]], [[Mexico (state)|Mexico]]. The group gained popularity in the early 1990s.<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web|url= {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=caf-tacuba-p33743/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title= Cafe Tacvba Biography|last= Birchmeier|first= Jason|publisher= [[Allmusic]]|access-date= 2010-11-13}}</ref> They were founded in 1989, before they had the current lineup of [[Rubén Albarrán|Rubén Isaac Albarrán Ortega]] (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Emmanuel del Real Díaz (keyboards, piano, [[Programming (music)|programming]], rhythm guitar, [[melodica]], vocals), José Alfredo "Joselo" Rangel Arroyo (lead guitar, vocals), and Enrique "Quique" Rangel Arroyo: (bass guitar, [[electric upright bass]], vocals), their friend Roberto Silva played the keyboards for a short period of time. Mexican folk music player Alejandro Flores was for a time considered the 5th ''tacubo'', as he played the t-violin in almost every Café Tacvba concert for many years. Since the ''[[Cuatro Caminos (album)|Cuatro Caminos]]'' World Tour, Luis "El Children" Ledezma has played the drums in every concert but is not considered an official member of the band.

== History ==

=== Formation (1989–90) ===
[[File:El Café de Tacuba.jpg|thumb|el Café de Tacuba]]

Previously known as "Alicia ya no vive aquí" (a tribute to [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]''), the band took its final name from a coffee shop (el Café de Tacuba) located in downtown [[Mexico City]]. The cafe, which opened in 1912 and had its heyday in the 1940s and 1950s, was representative of the [[Pachuco]] scene at the time, something the band would later acknowledge as an influence. The ''Café de Tacuba'' is still in operation as a coffee shop and restaurant on Tacuba Street, in Mexico City's Historic Center. The band changed its name to Café Tacvba (changing the u for a v) in order to avoid legal issues with the coffee shop.

Singer Rubén Albarran and guitarist  José Alfredo Rangel met while studying graphic design at [[Metropolitan Autonomous University]] in Mexico City.<ref name="Destiny">{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jul/18/entertainment/ca-57136|title=Their Destiny Awaits|date=July 18, 1999|access-date=2011-05-01|last=Lechner|first=Ernesto|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref><ref name="Niño A">{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/2005-07-07/music/ni-o-a/|title=¿Niño A?|last=Lechner|first=Ernesto|date=July 7, 2005|access-date=July 23, 2011|work=[[Houston Press]]|publisher=[[Village Voice Media]]}}</ref>  Rangel's brother, Enrique, completed the band's lineup in 1989.<ref name="Destiny" />  The group began playing music in the garage of a house in their neighborhood, Satélite, an upper-middle-class suburban area in the [[Naucalpan]] municipality, in the northern region of the [[Mexico City]] metropolitan area. Café Tacvba was principally influenced by alternative rock bands of the 1980s such as [[The Cure]], [[The Clash]], [[The Smiths]], and [[Violent Femmes]]. Despite their English-language influences, the band members wanted to represent their native culture, so they incorporated Mexican influences into their music. The group began singing primarily in Spanish and changed their name to Café Tacvba.<ref name="Allmusic" />

Café Tacvba went from being a garage band to a concert act in 1989, when they joined the scene surrounding El Hijo del Cuervo, a cultural club in [[Coyoacán]] featuring writers and musicians. As they performed in various venues around Mexico City, they were discovered by [[Argentina|Argentinian]] music producer [[Gustavo Santaolalla]], who at the time was producing albums for leading bands of the burgeoning [[Rock en Español]] movement of the time.<ref name="Allmusic" />  Santaolalla arranged a contract for the band with [[Warner Music Latina]] (WEA), with plans to produce its debut album himself. Café Tacvba in turn proceeded to record their first song for commercial release, "Tamales de Iguanita", which WEA released as part of a Christmas-themed rock en español compilation, ''Diciembre 25'', in 1990.

=== Early success (1991–96) ===
[[File:Cafe Tacuba Pontevedra.jpg|thumb|Café Tacvba performing in [[Pontevedra]], Spain.]]
The group's debut album, ''[[Café Tacvba (album)|Café Tacvba]]'', was released in 1992 and was extremely popular in Mexico. The group experimented with many different musical styles, from [[punk rock|punk]] and [[ska]], to [[electronica]] and [[hip hop]], to regional Mexican varieties such [[Norteño (music)|norteño]], [[bolero]], and [[ranchera]].<ref name="Allmusic" /> However, the band was taken aback by the stark difference between the sound on the album and group's "rawer" live sound, likening the recording to "a pasteurized version of ourselves".<ref name="comingofage">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rRAEAAAAMBAJ&q=cafe+tacuba&pg=PA71|title=The Coming of Age for Cafe Tacuba|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|last=Lopetegui|first=Enrique|date=December 9, 2000|access-date=July 24, 2012}}</ref>  Café Tacvba released five singles from the album – "Maria", "Rarotonga", "Las Persianas", "La Chica Banda" and "Las Batallas" – with a music video filmed for each, with the exception of the latter.<ref name="Allmusic" /> "María", directed by [[Gustavo Garzón]], was nominated for Video of the Year at the [[Premio Lo Nuestro 1993|Lo Nuestro Awards of 1993]].<ref name="billboardmag">{{cite journal

Two years later, the band released a follow-up album, ''[[Re (Café Tacuba album)|Re]]'', in 1994. The singles "La Ingrata" (which had a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIr8hsVTCzg music video] directed by Fernando De Garay), "Las Flores" (which had a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJvMwTgWcP0 music video] directed by Carlos Somonte) and "El Ciclón" were also commercially successful. On the album, collaborators included [[Luis Conte]] and Alejandra Flores, while unconventional rock instrumentation such as [[Jarana jarocha|jarana]], [[Guitarrón mexicano|guitarrón]], [[Melodeon (organ)|melodeon]], and [[drum machine]]s were employed. The album's mixture of genres such as [[alternative rock]], [[punk rock|punk]], and [[heavy metal music|metal]] with traditional Latin American styles helped the group develop a dedicated cult following.<ref name="Destiny" /> During the promotion of the album, the band's attendance at the 1995 New Music Seminar in New York helped garner some media attention in the United States.<ref name="Allmusic" />

In 1996, Café Tacvba released ''[[Avalancha de Éxitos]]'', meaning ''"Avalanche of Hits"'', a covers album in which the band performed songs by other Spanish-speaking artists. The tracks were recorded while the band was in the studio working on ''Re'' and grew tired of recording new material.<ref name="Destiny" />  ''Avalancha de Éxitos'' marked Café Tacvba's first appearance on [[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'s album charts (number 12 on the Latin Pop chart, 28 on Top Latin Albums), and the band commenced an international tour to promote the album.<ref name="Allmusic" /> In 1996, the band also contributed to the AIDS benefit album ''[[Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]] performing along with [[David Byrne]].<ref name="Allmusic" /> The music video for the single "Como Te Extraño" was nominated for a [[Premio Lo Nuestro 1997|Lo Nuestro Award]].<ref name="eltiempo">{{cite news|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-545706|title=Premios a Lo Mejor De La Música Latina|language=es|work=[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]|publisher=Casa Editorial El Tiempo S.A.|date=April 8, 1997|access-date=June 10, 2013}}</ref>

=== ''Revés/Yo Soy'' (1997–99) ===
In the wake of the group's international tour, Café Tacvba withdrew from music for a while. When they returned to work, they gathered in their own studio and spent roughly a half-year working on experimental music that encompassed [[Ambient music|ambient]] [[electronica]] and [[musique concrète]], as well as collaborative work with the [[Kronos Quartet]], an American string quartet.<ref name="Allmusic" /> Santaolalla liked the resulting music and deemed it ready for release. WEA, however, did not like the idea releasing an entirely instrumental album of experimental music, after the group had gained success with their more accessible style of music. In the end, WEA and Café Tacvba reached a compromise: if the band would record a second album of more conventional material, the label would release both as a double-disc package and sell it for the cost of a standard single-disc album.<ref name="Allmusic" />

As promised, the group returned to the studio to record an album of previously written material, and released ''[[Revés/Yo Soy]]'' in 1999. The album was a double-disc set, featuring both the band's instrumental music and the newly recorded album. The album is notable for its unconventional packaging style, designed by vocalist Rubén Isaac Albarrán. In addition, the album titles Revés (which translates to "reverse") and Yo Soy (a [[palindrome]]), exemplify the band's eccentricity. The album also featured two popular singles, "La Locomotora" and "La Muerte Chiquita", and a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKNkW5TAQiw music video] for "Revés", directed by [[Adolfo Dávila]]. The album won a [[Latin Grammy]] for Best Rock Album.<ref name="Allmusic" />

=== Hiatus and signing with MCA (2000–02) ===
After ''Revés/Yo Soy'', the group would not release another album for four years. In the meantime, Café Tacvba contributed recordings to various projects such as the ''[[Amores Perros]]'' (2000) and ''[[Y tu mamá también|Y Tu Mamá También]]'' (2002) soundtracks as well as the tribute album ''El Mas Grande Homenaje a Los Tigres del Norte'' (2001), which included a cover of "Futurismo y Tradición". In addition, guitarists Emmanuel del Real Díaz and Joselo Rangel produced a couple songs for Julieta Venegas: "Me Van a Matar" and "Disco Eterno".<ref name="Allmusic" /> Rangel also began work on a solo album, ''Oso'', in 2003, which was produced by Albarrán.

While Café Tacvba pursued these various projects, they were looking for a new recording contract; the WEA relationship had come to an end after a trio of compilations released in 2001: ''[[Tiempo Transcurrido|Tiempo transcurrido: The Best of Café Tacvba]]''; a videos collection of the same name; and ''Lo Esencial de Café Tacvba'', a triple-disc package containing the band's first three albums. [[Maverick Records]], [[Madonna]]'s label, reportedly attempted to sign Café Tacvba during this time; however, the band decided ultimately to sign with MCA Records in 2002.<ref name="Allmusic" />

=== ''Cuatro Caminos'' (2003–06) ===
When Café Tacvba began work on ''[[Cuatro Caminos (album)|Cuatro Caminos]]'', the band took a different approach than in the past. They decided to work with a live drummer, and recruited [[Victor Indrizzo]] and [[Joey Waronker]]. Secondly, they wanted to work with a couple choice producers besides Santaolalla and Kerpel; they recruited Dave Friedman and [[Andrew Weiss (guitarist)|Andrew Weiss]]. Released in June 2003, ''Cuatro Caminos'' was met with commercial and critical success. The album won a [[Grammys]] for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album as well as two [[Latin Grammys]] for Best Alternative Album and Best Rock Song ("[[Eres (Café Tacvba song)|Eres]]").

The group toured extensively after the release of ''Cuatro Caminos'', and released a live album of a performance in front of 20,000 people in Mexico City at El Palacio de los Deportes in October 2004. The album was called ''[[Un Viaje (Café Tacuba album)|Un Viaje]]'', and was a double-disc set. After the release of the album, the group took a three-year break from releasing music.

=== ''Sino'' (2007–2010) ===
[[File:Cafe Tacuba Buenos Aires.jpg|thumb|right|Café Tacvba performing in [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]] on February 22, 2008]]
In 2007 Café Tacvba returned with a new studio album, ''Sino''. The album has been compared to [[classic rock]] groups such as [[The Who]] and the [[Beach Boys]], a departure from their previous [[techno]] and [[Funk music|funk]]-influenced sound.<ref name="Crashes">{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/dec/03/entertainment/et-tacuba3|title=Cafe Tacuba crashes, thrashes and rocks|last=Wald|first=Elijah|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 3, 2007|access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref> The band also performed on the main stage at [[Lollapalooza]] that summer. On September 10, 2008, Café Tacvba became the leading nominee at the [[Latin Grammy Awards of 2008]] with a total of six nominations: [[Latin Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] and [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Alternative Music Album]], for ''Sino''. The [[lead single]] "Volver a Comenzar" was shortlisted for [[Latin Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and Best Alternative Song, the second single "Esta Vez" received nominations for [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Rock Song|Best Rock Song]] and [[Latin Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]]. The band took the record for most [[Latin Grammy]]s won in one night. The inclusion of the song "Volver a Comenzar" in ''[[LittleBigPlanet]]'' projected the band internationally.

In 2008, the band collaborated with [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] duo [[Calle 13 (band)|Calle 13]] on the song "[[No Hay Nadie Como Tú]]". The song peaked at number 23 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Latin Songs]]<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=calle 13|chart=all}} Calle 13], Chart history, Billboard.com. Retrieved December 7, 2008</ref> and number 15 on the ''Billboard'' [[Latin Rhythm Airplay]].<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/chart_display.jsp?cfi=403&cfgn=Singles&cfn=Latin+Rhythm+Airplay&ci=3102172&cdi=10025162&cid=10%2F25%2F2008 No Hay Nadie Como Tu – Billboard Latin Rhythm Airplay Chart Listing]{{Dead link|date=June 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} – ''Billboard'' – Retrieved October 23, 2008</ref>

== Members ==
=== Rubén Isaac Albarrán Ortega ===
{{Main|Rubén Albarrán}}
[[File:Rubén Isaac Albarrán.jpg|right|thumb|Rubén Isaac Albarrán]]
Vocalist and guitar player. Previously, until 2001, he played in an alternative band called ''Villa Jardín''. In 2006 he announced his solo debut, ''Bienvenido al sueño'' (''Welcome to the Dream''), it consists of electronic instruments with [[Buddhist]] influences and [[Prehispanic]] Mexican which he describes as ''"música protónica por no limitarlo o estereotiparlo"'' (''protonic music so as not to limit or stereotype it'').

He is also known as "Juan", "Cosme", "Masiosare", "Anónimo" (''Anonymous''), "Nrü" (pronunciation given as "Dshiu" in Spanish; perhaps intended to be {{IPA-oax|dʒy|}}), "Amparo Tonto Medardo In Lak’ech" or "At Medardo ILK", "G3", "Gallo Gasss" (''Gasss Rooster''), "Élfego Buendía", "Rita Cantalagua", "Sizu Yantra", "Ixaya Mazatzin Tleyótl", "Ixxi Xoo" and now "Cone Cahuitl". He lived the first four years of his life in [[Monterrey]]. Studied at UAM ([[Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana]]) where he received a bachelor's degree in Design and Graphic Communication. Rubén, or however he is now known, has always pushed gender norms through provocative lyrics, and the occasional skirt worn on stage at concerts.

In the shows prior to the release of their first album, people would yell "Juan!" (the name of one of the band's first underground hits) to Rubén, so he kept the name for the release of the first album. Two years later he got bored and changed it to "Cosme" for the release of "Re". Since then, he has changed his name for every album and world tour.

In 2010, while on break from Café Tacvba, Rubén Albarrán formed a side project called [[Hoppo! (band)|HopPo!]]<ref>[https://www.npr.org/blogs/altlatino/2010/10/19/130674912/cafe-tacuba-lead-singer-launches-new-band Contreras, Felix.

Hoppo's self-titled debut album consists of [[Latin American]] [[folk music|folk]] cover songs, and no original material. This particular type of folk music, also known as [[Nueva Canción]], was originally written in the 1960s and 1970s during a [[social movement]] of protest and [[anti-establishment]] sentiment by [[South American]] [[singer-songwriters]] and [[social activists]]. The album contains three songs written by [[Violeta Parra]], including "[[Gracias a la Vida]]".<ref>Autobombo.

=== Emmanuel Del Real ===
[[File:08-2003-0045.JPG|right|thumb|Emmanuel del Real]]
Emmanuel "Meme" del Real has been in the band from the moment they took the name Café Tacvba. Since the beginning he has been in charge of the keyboards, [[acoustic guitar]], piano, [[music programming]], vocals, [[Melodeon (organ)|melodeon]], and [[melodica]].

For a long time he only sang backup, but since the release of ''[[Re (Café Tacuba album)|Re]]'' in 1992, he began singing lead on songs like ''El Borrego'' (''The Lamb'') or ''Pez'' (''Fish''), he also began playing the guitar more than before.

On the covers album ''[[Avalancha de Éxitos]]'' he plays guitar on ''No Controles'' (''Don't Control''). Since then he's also been known to play the [[Jarana jarocha|jarana]]. Del Real has written some of the band's biggest hits such as ''La Ingrata'' (''The Ingrate''), ''Las Flores'' (''The Flowers''), ''Aviéntame'' (''Throw Me'') and ''[[Eres (Café Tacvba song)|Eres]]'' (''You Are'').

He is known in the Mexican electronica scene as "DJ Angustias"; is part of the [[Noiselab]] collective; and released a solo album in late 2005. Del Real has also produced songs for many Mexican artists like [[Julieta Venegas]], [[Natalia Lafourcade]], [[Ely Guerra]], and [[Liquits]], among others.

=== José Alfredo Rangel Arroyo ===
[[File:Joselo Rangel.jpg|right|thumb|Joselo Rangel]]
José "Joselo" Alfredo Rangel, spent the first 9 years of his life in [[Minatitlán, Veracruz]], until his family moved to [[Mexico DF]] where he studied industrial design in the [[Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana|UAM]].

During his youth he had various hobbies like comic books and design even though he decided music was his major passion.
While in college he met a person with a peculiar voice and extravagant ideas: Albarrán. They became best friends and with his brother, Enrique "Quique" Rangel and they formed a band called ''Alicia Ya No Vive Aquí''.

Later on he started working on a new project called "Cafe Tacuba" with Ruben Albarran on the vocals, Enrique "Quique" Rangel on the bass (contrabajo) and Roberto Silva on the keyboards. Emmanuel del Real took the place of Roberto when he left before the band became famous.

After 13 years with the band Rangel decided to launch a solo side project. He has released two albums: the first, 2001's "Oso" (''Bear''), named after Joselo's childhood nickname; the second, titled "Lejos" (''Far'') in 2005.

He wrote four books, ''CRockónicas Marcianas'' (a compilation of chronicles, 2011), the collection od stories O''ne hit wonder'' (2015), the novel ''Los desesperados'' (2018) and ''Cuba Stone'' (2016), a review about The Rolling Stones' concert in Cuba, in collaboration with Javier Sinay and Jeremías Gamboa.
[[File:Quique Rangel.jpg|right|thumb|Quique Rangel]]

=== Enrique Rangel Arroyo ===

<ref>{{in lang|es}} [[:es:Enrique Rangel Arroyo|Enrique Rangel Arroyo – Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre]]. Es.wikipedia.org. Retrieved on 2013-05-31.</ref>  Enrique "Quique" Rangel Arroyo was a designer whose interest in music was influenced by his brother Joselo. He was introduced to Albarrán by Joselo and together, along with Beto Silva, formed "Cafe Tacuba". He abandoned his career as a designer when he brought the band De Real in the late 80s and they changed their name to Café Tacvba.

He designs album art for other bands and, like De Real, composes melodies for other groups. He is also a member of a side project called ''Los Odio''.

=== Alejandro Flores ===

Folk musician Alejandro Flores plays violin and is considered the ''fifth Tacubo''. He has played with the band since 1994. He has also participated on two [[LP album|LPs]] by ''San Pascualito Rey''.

=== Luis Ledezma ===
Also known as "El Children", Ledezma is the band's live drummer but is not considered an official band member.

== Genre ==
Their musical style covers a wide variety of genres, though it is most commonly labeled as [[Latin Alternative]]/[[Rock en Español]]. Their music has been heavily influenced by Mexico's [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] population and [[folk music]] traditions, but also by punk and electronic music and other bands on the [[Mexico City]] scene. Perhaps the most distinctive feature of their music is Albarrán's nasal voice, which, combined with his impressive lung capacity (as demonstrated on "La Ingrata", a homage of [[norteño (music)|norteño music]]), makes for a very distinctive sound. They sing entirely in Spanish but have a significant Anglophone following regardless.

The song "Chilanga Banda" has a [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] beat under a stream of Mexico City slang originally written by Jaime López, "María" is a 'bolero' ballad about a ghost, "El Fin de la Infancia" a [[brass instrument|brass]]-heavy 'banda ranchera' sound that reflects the influence of 'banda sinaloense', "Desperté" has a tango-driven melody while "El Borrego" mocks [[speed metal]].

== Discography ==
[[File:Café_Tacvba..jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bulldog Café, México, Distrito Federal]]
