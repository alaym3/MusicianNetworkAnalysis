'''Die Antwoord''' ({{IPA-af|di ˈantvuərt|pron}}, [[Afrikaans]] for "The Answer") is a [[South Africa]]n [[alternative hip hop]] group formed in [[Cape Town]] in 2008.

The group comprises rappers [[Watkin Tudor Jones|Watkin Tudor "Ninja" Jones]] and [[Yolandi Visser|Anri "Yolandi Visser" du Toit]], a male/female duo, and producers HITEK5000 and Lil2Hood. Their image revolves around the South African [[counterculture]] [[Social movement|movement]] known as ''[[zef]]'' and has incorporated work by other artists associated with the movement, such as photographer [[Roger Ballen]].

==Background==
Die Antwoord's male vocalist, [[Watkin Tudor Jones|Watkin Tudor "Ninja" Jones]], was part of the South African hip-hop scene for many years, fronting acts such as The Original Evergreen, [[MaxNormal.TV]] and [[The Constructus Corporation]]. Their debut album ''$O$'' relates to their earlier work, specifically ''Good Morning South Africa''. In the album, multiple tracks are sampled from, or are exact copies of songs on ''Good Morning South Africa'', such as the "Rap Rave Megamix" (where the first glimpses of Jones's Ninja character was seen) were later reformed into the "Zef Side" video, featuring a few verses from "Beat Boy".<ref name="Channel24">{{cite news| date =28 February 2010|last=Barker|first=Jean|title=24 Facts: Die Antwoord|url=http://www.channel24.co.za/Music/FeaturesInterviews/24-Facts-Die-Antwoord-20100204|newspaper=Channel24}}</ref> Ninja told ''Rolling Stone'', "Everything I did before Die Antwoord was me experimenting, messing around and trying to find ''Die Antwoord'' . . . everything before it was disposable. It was all throwaway."<ref name="coetzer2012">Coetzer, Diane (30 January 2012). [http://www.rollingstone.co.za/musicrev/item/529-die-antwoord-the-rolling-stone-interview Die Antwoord: The Rolling Stone Interview.] ''[[Rolling Stone]]''</ref>

Die Antwoord observed that journalists and critics, particularly in the United States, frequently ask if their creative output is a joke or a hoax. When asked if he was playing a character, Ninja said, "Ninja is, how can I say, like Superman is to Clark Kent. The only difference is I don't take off this fokken Superman suit."<ref>{{cite web|last=Holnaaier|first=Kobus|title=Straight from the horse's piel|url=http://vimeo.com/15196261| date =22 September 2010}}</ref> They have described their work as "documentary fiction" and "exaggerated experience" designed for shock value. Ninja told ''Spin'':
<blockquote>People are unconscious, and you have to use your art as a shock machine to wake them up. Some people are too far gone. They'll just keep asking, "Is it real? Is it real?" That's dwanky. That's a word we have in South Africa, "dwanky." It's like lame. "Is it real?" You have to be futuristic and carry on. You gotta be a good guide to help people get away from dull experience.<ref name="Marchese2012">Marchese, David (7 February 2012).[https://www.spin.com/2012/02/die-antwoords-totally-insane-words-wisdom/ Die Antwoord's Totally Insane Words of Wisdom.] ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''</ref></blockquote>

Die Antwoord is known for their [[cult following]], in particular the unusually prolific creation of [[fan art]] by their followers.<ref name="Mechanic2012">Mechanic, Michael (February 2012).

===Zef===

Following the success of the video, Die Antwoord signed a record deal with [[Interscope Records]]. In April 2010, they performed their first international concert at the [[Coachella Music Festival]], in front of 40,000 people. They then toured internationally in support of ''$O$''.<ref name="Reuters" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.watkykjy.co.za/die-antwoord/ |title=Die Antwoord |publisher=Watkykjy.co.za |date=2010-04-18 |access-date=2014-07-13}}</ref>

The EP "[[5 (Die Antwoord EP)|5]]" was the first official release by Die Antwoord on a major record label, [[Cherrytree Records]] (an imprint of Interscope Records). The EP features some previously released material, as well as one new track and a remix. "Fish Paste" was released as a [[Promotional recording|promotional single]]. Pitchfork Media made the entire EP available to stream on 12 June 2010.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Later in 2010, an EP "Ekstra" was released.

===2011–2013: ''Ten$ion'', record label dispute===
[[File:Die-antwoord-holnaaier2.jpg|thumb|right|Die Antwoord performing in 2012]]
In November 2011, Die Antwoord left [[Interscope Records]] over a dispute concerning their upcoming album and its lead single, "Fok Julle Naaiers".<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|last=Fairbanks|first=Eve|title=Johannesburg's Most Wanted|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/29/magazine/die-antwoord.html?_r=2&hpw|access-date=26 January 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=26 January 2012}}</ref> Visser explained that Interscope "kept pushing us to be more generic" in order to make more money: "If you try to make songs that other people like, your band will always be shit. You always gotta do what you like. If it connects, it's a miracle, but it happened with Die Antwoord."<ref name="Marchese2012"/> Die Antwoord formed their own [[independent label]], Zef Recordz, and released their new album ''[[Ten$Ion]]'' through it.<ref name="jardin2011nov">Jardin, Xeni (7 November 2012). [http://boingboing.net/2011/11/07/dieantwoordleave.html Die Antwoord leave Interscope, will release "TEN$ION" on their own new indie label.] ''[[Boing Boing]]''</ref>

The release was in association with the [[Good Smile Company]] and [[Downtown Records]], which handled the marketing and distribution for the record worldwide.<ref name="coetzer2012" /> ''Ten$Ion'' included three more singles following "Fok Julle Naaiers": "I Fink U Freeky", "Baby's on Fire", and "[[Fatty Boom Boom]]". The singles included on ''Ten$Ion'' began to bring Die Antwoord more into the global spotlight as they were invited to perform on American talk shows and featured in an [[Alexander Wang (designer)|Alexander Wang]] advertisement. However, the album was met with average to poor reviews by many critics.

''Ten$Ion'' was followed up with a non-album single, "XP€N$IV $H1T", as well as a remix of [[Mims (rapper)|Mims]]' song [[This Is Why I'm Hot]], "Diz Iz Why I'm Hot".

===2014: ''Donker Mag'' and further touring===
Following the release of "XP€N$IV $H1T", Die Antwoord set out on a brief tour across Europe from June to July. Soon after they began touring, snippets for a new single called "Cookie Thumper!", which was to be accompanied by a music video, were released. Around the release of their new single, Die Antwoord also announced the title of their third album, ''[[Donker Mag]]'', which was released on 3 June 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/News/die_antwoord_return_with_donker_mag_album_share_new_video|title=Die Antwoord Reveal 'Donker Mag' LP, Share New Video|last=Hughes|first=Josiah|publisher=exclaim.ca|access-date=20 May 2014}}</ref>

In an interview, Ninja states that "Neill is, like, our favorite director, so when he asked us to be in ''Chappie'', it was like a complete freak-out". In the film, Die Antwoord star as two gangsters (also named Ninja and Yolandi) who act like the parents of Chappie, a sentient robot, and teach him how to be a gangster.<ref>{{Citation |last=Blomkamp |first=Neill |title=''Chappie'' |date=2015-03-06 |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1823672/ |access-date=2016-05-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ninja From Die Antwoord Was Allegedly A Huge Pain in the Ass While Filming ''Chappie''|url=http://uproxx.com/filmdrunk/2015/03/ninja-from-die-antwoord-was-allegedly-a-huge-pain-in-the-ass-during-chappie/|publisher=Uproxx|author=Vince Mancini|date=2015-03-04|access-date=2015-03-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Merry |first=Stephanie |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2015/03/08/die-antwoord-is-pretty-definitely-not-going-to-win-any-oscars-for-chappie/ |title=''Chappie'' tops box office, but Die Antwoord better not quit their day jobs |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2005-03-09 |access-date=2015-04-16 }}</ref> The film was released on 4 March 2015.

In 2019, Die Antwoord started releasing an online reality web series called ZEF TV. There are currently 8 episodes which make up the first season. Later that year, it was revealed that they would be releasing a documentary called "IS IT REAL?" that had been in the works for 10 years, as well as a feature film called "THE FLOWER FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dieantwoord.com/yoho-magazine/|title=YOHO!

In a teaser video for the ''Ten$ion'' album, a character that resembles Jane Alexander's [[the Butcher Boys]] was featured.<ref>{{cite web|title=Die Antwoord takes cue from Butcher Boys|url=http://www.channel24.co.za/Music/News/Die-Antwoord-takes-cue-from-Butcher-Boys-20120123|work=Channel24|access-date=10 February 2013|date=23 January 2012}}</ref> Due to a copyright claim, the video was removed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Die Antwoord Trailer Pulled Over Copyright Issues|url=http://www.2oceansvibe.com/2012/02/15/die-antwoord-trailer-pulled-over-copyright-issues/jane-alexander-butcher-boys/|work=2oceans vibe|access-date=10 February 2013}}</ref>

==In popular culture==

Several of Die Antwoord's songs have been featured in the open-world action video games ''[[Far Cry 3]]'' and ''[[Far Cry New Dawn]]'', "I Fink U Freeky", "Fatty Boom Boom", "Cookie Thumper" and "She Just Got Real".<ref>{{cite web|URL=https://www.criticalhit.net/gaming/far-cry-3-features-die-antwoord/|title=Die Antwoord in Far Cry 3|accessdate=19 March 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|URL=https://guides.gamepressure.com/far-cry-new-dawn/guide.asp?ID=48796|title=New Dawn Soundtrack|accessdate=19 March 2021}}</ref>

==Controversy==

=== Sexual assault allegations ===
In March 2019, [[Australian]] musician Zheani Sparkes released a [[Diss Track|diss track]] titled "The Question" accusing Jones of allegedly sexually assaulting her in South Africa in 2013. According to Sparkes, Jones drugged her and [[Human trafficking|trafficked]] her to Africa, as well as sending explicit photos of her to cast members of [[Chappie (film)|''Chappie'']]. She also said he was interested in her because of her resemblance to his daughter Sixteen Jones, who in 2013 was 8. Text messages shown in the music video for the track show Jones attempting to engage in incest fantasies with Sparkes.<ref>{{Citation|title=ZHEANI - THE QUESTION|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JY6hCE2D-cc| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/JY6hCE2D-cc| archive-date=2021-11-17 | url-status=live|language=en|access-date=2020-02-13}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Zheani later clarified during an interview that her labeling of Ninja as a pedophile was more [[pejorative]] than a serious accusation.<ref>{{Citation|title=Zheani on Die Antwoord's Abuse and Attempts To Censor Her|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pZJsgTr_FM| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/-pZJsgTr_FM| archive-date=2021-11-17 | url-status=live|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}{{cbignore}}</ref> However, these allegations have not been proven.

A conflict between Die Antwoord and Sparkes ensued on social media afterwards, where Jones accused Sparkes of catfishing him.<ref>{{Citation|title=DIE ANTWOORD - CATFISH #🇦🇺🐱🐟|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW_JiG-3DNk| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191110121443/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW_JiG-3DNk| archive-date=2019-11-10 | url-status=dead|language=en|access-date=2020-02-13}}</ref> In September 2019, Sparkes filed a police report in [[Queensland|Queensland, Australia]] formalizing her accusations of supposed sexual assault and [[revenge porn]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tonedeaf.thebrag.com/zheani-die-antwoord-ninja/|title=Zheani pressing sexual assault charges against Die Antwoord’s Ninja|date=2019-09-16|website=Tone Deaf|language=en-AU|access-date=2020-02-13}}</ref>

American singer Dionna Dal Monte also accused Jones of sexual assault. Dal Monte asserts the assault occurred at a Die Antwoord show in [[Padova]] in 2014.<ref name="SMH">{{Cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/australian-woman-accuses-die-antwoord-singer-ninja-of-sexual-assault-20190904-p52nv7.html|title=Australian woman accuses Die Antwoord singer Ninja of sexual assault|last=Bossi|first=Dominic|date=15 September 2019|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=5 October 2019}}</ref> 

Jones has denied all the allegations against him.<ref name="SMH"/>

=== Fight against Andy Butler ===
In 2019, a video from 2012 surfaced, showing Visser and Jones fighting [[Hercules and Love Affair]] founder Andy Butler while calling him [[Homophobia|homophobic]] slurs such as "[[Faggot (slang)|faggot]]". Butler openly identifies as gay.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thefullest.com/2017/08/29/hercules-love-affairs-andy-butler-business-gay/|title=Hercules and Love Affair’s Andy Butler on the Business of Being Gay|last=says|first=Karrie|date=2017-08-29|website=The Fullest|language=en|access-date=2020-02-13}}</ref> After fighting him, Visser and Jones alert security staff, and, while crying, Visser claims she was [[Sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] in a bathroom by Butler. Later on in the video, Jones tells her that her performance was "[[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/die-antwoord-removed-festivals-homophobic-attack-hercules-love-affair-andy-butler-2539949|title=Die Antwoord axed from festivals for 'homophobic attack' on Andy Butler|date=2019-08-20|website=NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs {{!}} NME.COM|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-02-13}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Yolandi makes fake sexual assault allegations.

Jones responded on [[Facebook]], claiming that the person who filmed the video edited it to make it seem like he and Visser were in the wrong. He claims that Butler harassed them in the days leading up to the fight. Jones also claimed that he told Visser to act as "dramatic as possible" about what Butler did to avoid getting detained by security after the fight.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/DieAntwoord/posts/10157192229201971|title=DIE ANTWOORD|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-13}}</ref>

Die Antwoord and Butler were subsequently dropped from the lineups of several festivals.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dallasobserver.com/music/can-die-antwoord-survive-their-latest-in-string-of-scandals-11764757|title=Die Antwoord Reschedules Dallas Show Amid Controversy.
