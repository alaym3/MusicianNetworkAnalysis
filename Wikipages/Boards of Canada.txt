==History==
===Early years (1986–1994)===
Brothers Michael Sandison (born 1 June 1970) and Marcus Eoin (born Marcus Eoin Sandison, 21 July 1971) were brought up in [[Cullen, Moray]] on the north east coast of Scotland.<ref name=theface>

From 1979 to 1980 they lived in the Canadian city of [[Calgary]] while their father, who worked in construction, took part in the project to build the [[Saddledome]].<ref name=pitchfork/> Both brothers attended the [[University of Edinburgh]], where Michael studied [[music]] and Marcus studied [[artificial intelligence]], though Marcus dropped out before completing his degree.<ref name=theface/>

Growing up in a musical family, the brothers first played instruments at a young age. They experimented with recording techniques from around the age of 10, using [[tape recorder|tape machine]]s to layer cut-up [[sampling (music)|samples]] of found sounds over compositions of their own.<ref name=pitchfork/> In their teens they participated in a number of amateur bands. However, it was not until 1986 when Marcus was invited to join Mike's band that Boards of Canada was born. The band's name was inspired by the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB), the government agency whose award winning documentary films and animation they had watched as children.<ref name=pitchfork/> By 1989, the band had been reduced to Mike and Marcus. In the early 1990s, a number of collaborations took place and the band put on small shows among the "''[[Hexagon Sun]]''" collective.

===''Music Has the Right to Children'' (1995–2002)===
In 1995, the band made their first Hexagon Sun studio release, the EP ''[[Twoism]]''. Like earlier [[Music70]] releases, it was produced in a self-financed limited run and was privately distributed, primarily to friends and labels. Unlike previous releases, however, a small number of copies were also released to the public through a mailing list. Though not a widespread commercial release, it was considered of sufficient quality and worth to be subsequently re-pressed in 2002.

The band made another release in 1996; titled ''[[Boc Maxima]]'', it was a semi-private release that was notable for being a full-length album, and was the precursor to ''[[Music Has the Right to Children]]'', with which it shares many tracks.

Boards of Canada's first commercial release occurred after attracting the attention of [[Autechre]]'s [[Sean Booth]], of the English label [[Skam Records]], one of many people who were sent a demo EP. Skam issued what was considered Boards of Canada's first "findable" work, ''[[Hi Scores]]'', in 1996.

The debut studio album, ''[[Music Has the Right to Children]]'', was released in April 1998. The album consists of longer tracks mixed with song vignettes. It also includes one of the duo's most popular songs, "Roygbiv". ''Music Has the Right to Children'' received widespread acclaim upon release. It featured at No. 35 on [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]'s "Top 100 Albums of the 1990s" list.<ref>{{citation |url=http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/5923-top-100-albums-of-the-1990s/7/ |title=Staff Lists: Top 100 Albums of the 1990s – Features – Pitchfork|publisher=Pitchfork.com|access-date=15 June 2013}}</ref> It was ranked No. 91 in [[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'s 100 Modern Classics list.

[[John Peel]] featured Boards of Canada on his [[BBC Radio 1]] programme in July of that year. The session featured two remixes from ''[[Music Has the Right to Children]]'' — "Aquarius (Version 3)" and "Olson (Version 3)" — along with the tracks "Happy Cycling" and "XYZ". Excluding "XYZ", the set was released on a [[Warp Records]] CD titled ''[[Peel Session TX 21/07/1998]]''.

Though never an actively touring band, Boards of Canada did perform a handful of shows. Early shows saw them supporting Warp labelmates [[Seefeel]] and [[Autechre]] in a handful of UK dates. They also participated in a few festivals and multi-artist bills including two Warp parties: [[Live @ Warp10|Warp's 10th Anniversary Party]] in 1999 and The Incredible Warp Lighthouse Party almost one year later. They made their most prominent showing in 2001 as one of the headliners at the [[Tortoise (band)|Tortoise]]-curated [[Live @ ATP|All Tomorrow's Parties]]. They have not performed a live show since.

The band released a four-track EP, ''[[In a Beautiful Place Out in the Country]]'', in November 2000, their first original release in two years. The 12" edition was pressed on [[sky blue]] vinyl.

===''Geogaddi'' and ''The Campfire Headphase'' (2002–2009)===
Their second studio album, ''[[Geogaddi]]'', was released in February 2002. Like ''[[Music Has the Right to Children]]'', this album consists of longer tracks mixed with song vignettes. It also presents a darker sound than its predecessor. ''Geogaddi'' received universal acclaim from music critics.

It was described by Sandison as "a record for some sort of trial-by-fire, a claustrophobic, twisting journey that takes you into some pretty dark experiences before you reach the open air again."<ref>[http://fredd-e.narfum.org/formerboc/interviews/#oor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727112740/http://fredd-e.narfum.org/formerboc/interviews/#oor|date=27 July 2011}}</ref>

Their third album for [[Warp Records]], ''[[The Campfire Headphase]]'', was released on 17 October 2005 in [[Europe]] and 18 October 2005 in the [[United States]]. The album featured fifteen tracks, including "Peacock Tail", "Chromakey Dreamcoat," and "[[Dayvan Cowboy]]". Two versions of "Dayvan Cowboy" — the original and a remix by [[Odd Nosdam]] — are on the six-track EP, ''[[Trans Canada Highway (EP)|Trans Canada Highway]]'', which was released on 26 May 2006.

In late 2009, the ''[[Warp20 (Recreated)]]'' compilation featured two BoC covers, one by [[Bibio]] of their song "Kaini Industries" and one by [[Mira Calix]] of "In a Beautiful Place Out in the Country". [[Warp20 (Recreated)]] is part of the larger Warp20 boxed set, which also includes two previously unreleased Boards of Canada tracks, "Seven Forty Seven" and a 1.8 second sample of the song "Spiro", which had previously been performed at their show at the Incredible Warp Lighthouse Party in 2000.

===''Tomorrow's Harvest'' (2013)===
On [[Record Store Day]] 2013, a vinyl record containing a short clip of music which was believed to be the work of Boards of Canada surfaced at the New York record store [[Other Music]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Sean Michaels |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/22/boards-of-canada-clue-new-album |title=Does Boards of Canada's record-store clue point to new album? &#124; Music |work=The Guardian|date=22 April 2013 |access-date=15 June 2013}}</ref><ref name=guardian>{{cite web|last1=Pattison|first1=Louis|title=Boards of Canada: 'We've become a lot more nihilistic over the years'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/06/boards-of-canada-become-more-nihilistic|website=The Guardian|access-date=12 September 2014|date=6 June 2013}}</ref> Shortly after the release, Warp Records vouched for the record's authenticity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/50420-boards-of-canada-released-a-mysterious-12-on-record-store-day/ |title=Boards of Canada Released a Mysterious 12" on Record Store Day &#124; News |publisher=Pitchfork |date=21 April 2013 |access-date=15 June 2013}}</ref> The record (titled ''------/------/------/XXXXXX/------/------'') contained a short clip of audio followed by a voice reading six digits similar to that of a [[numbers station]]. The record revealed what was to become one of six unique numbers that were part of a type of [[alternate reality game]] that was used to promote the release of their next studio album.

The rest of the codes were hidden through various websites and online communities, as well as being broadcast over [[BBC Radio One]], [[NPR]], and [[Adult Swim]].<ref>Minsker, Evan.

Once all six unique codes are entered, a video is shown announcing ''[[Tomorrow's Harvest]]'', their fourth [[studio album]]. The album was released on 5 June 2013 in [[Japan]], 10 June 2013 in Europe, and 11 June 2013 in the United States to widespread critical acclaim.

===Remixes===
In 2016, Boards of Canada released two remixes. The first, of [[Nevermen]]'s "Mr Mistake", was released on 12 January,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cS1lMn42l04|title=NEVERMEN – Mr Mistake (Boards of Canada Remix)|last=NEVERMEN|date=12 January 2016|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> and was followed shortly after by a remix of "Sisters" by [[Odd Nosdam]] on 22 February.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzjoArxwW2E|title=Odd Nosdam – Sisters (Boards of Canada remix)|last=LeavingRecords|date=22 February 2016|via=YouTube}}</ref> On 17 February 2017, an instrumental version of the "Mr Mistake" remix was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0sNLKMJAoQ|title=NEVERMEN – Mr Mistake (Boards of Canada Remix Instrumental)|date=17 February 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref> In 2017 Boards of Canada released a remix of "Sometimes" by The Sexual Objects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/The-Sexual-Objects-Sometimes-Remixes/release/10681671|title=The Sexual Objects - Sometimes Remixes|website=Discogs.com|access-date=1 December 2019}}</ref> On July 3, 2021, Boards of Canada released a remix of a second Nevermen song, "Treat Em Right".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Strauss |first1=Matthew |title=Boards of Canada Share New Remix of Nevermen’s "Treat Em Right": Listen |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/boards-of-canada-share-new-remix-of-nevermen-treat-em-right-listen/ |access-date=3 July 2021 |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=3 July 2021}}</ref>

===''WXAXRXP'' (2019)===
In 2019, Warp Records kicked off the celebrations for their 30th anniversary, entitled WXAXRXP, with a 100-hour takeover of online radio station [[NTS Radio]], featuring mixes, radio shows and unreleased music from a number of artists on their roster. This included a 2-hour mixtape from Boards of Canada<ref>{{cite web |title=WXAXRXP |url=https://www.nts.live/projects/wxaxrxp |website=NTS |access-date=21 July 2019}}</ref> titled ''Societas x Tape'', aired on 23 June 2019 at 9:00 PM BST, and featured music from other artists such as [[Grace Jones]], [[Devo]] and [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]], spliced with spoken word samples and music that is rumoured to be unreleased work from the group itself.<ref>{{cite web |title=Boards of Canada - Societas x Tape |url=https://www.nts.live/shows/wxaxrxp/episodes/boards-of-canada-23rd-june-2019 |website=NTS |access-date=21 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Christian |first1=Eede |title=LISTEN: WXAXRXP Highlights |url=https://thequietus.com/articles/26697-warp-nts-highlights-boards-of-canada-autechre |website=The Quietus |access-date=21 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Young |first1=Alex |title=Boards of Canada debut new two-hour mix Societas x Tape |url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/06/boards-of-canada-debut-new-two-hour-mix-societas-x-tape/ |website=Consequence of Sound |access-date=21 July 2019}}</ref>

==Style and methods==
BoC's sound has been described by [[AllMusic]] as "evocative, mournful, [[sample (music)|sample]]-laden [[downtempo]] music often sounding as though produced on malfunctioning equipment excavated from the ruins of an early-'70s [[computer lab]].”<ref name="all">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/geogaddi-mw0000218904 |title=Geogaddi – Boards of Canada |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2 December 2015 |last=Bush |first=John}}</ref> Critic [[Simon Reynolds]] described their style as "a hazy sound of smeared synth-tones and analog-decayed production, carried by patient, sleepwalking beats, and aching with nostalgia" while crediting them with "reinvent[ing]" elements of [[psychedelia]] through the deliberate misuse of technology.<ref name="pitchfork.com">{{cite web|last1=Reynolds|first1=Simon|title=Why Boards of Canada's Music Has the Right to Children Is the Greatest Psychedelic Album of the '90s|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/article/why-boards-of-canadas-music-has-the-right-to-children-is-the-greatest-psychedelic-album-of-the-90s/|website=[[Pitchfork Media]]|access-date=3 April 2018}}</ref> Their distinctive style is a product of their use of [[Analog signal|analogue]] equipment, mix of electronic and conventional instrumentation, use of distorted samples as well as live and recorded lyrics, and their layering and blending of these elements.<ref name="hmv">Pytlik, Mark.

Brief interludes or vignettes feature prominently in BoC's music, often lasting less than two minutes; BoC state, "we write far more of [these] than the so-called 'full-on' tracks, and, in a way, they are our own favourites".<ref name="oor" /> BoC have written an enormous number of such fragments as well as full-length tracks, most of which have been held back from release. It does not appear that their music is made exclusively for commercial release; rather, albums seem to be the result of selecting complementary songs from current work. For instance, ''[[Geogaddi]]'' allegedly involved the creation of 400 song fragments and 64 complete songs, of which 22 were selected (possibly 23, if the final track of complete silence is included).<ref name="oor"/> Says Marcus: "The idea of the perfect album is this amorphous thing that we're always aiming at […] the whole point of making music is at least to aim at your own idea of perfection."<ref name="oor" />

Interviews with the Sandison brothers provide some insight into their creative process. They have cited several acts that have influenced their work including [[Joni Mitchell]], the [[The Incredible String Band|Incredible String Band]] ("we have all the String Band records […] our rural sensibilities are similar"), the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] ("[they] really became enthralling to us through their psychedelism"), and [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]] ("even if we don't sound like them, there's a connection in terms of the approach to music").<ref name=pitchfork /><ref name="oor">Poolman, Koen.

They have also expressed a strong interest in the power of [[subliminal message|subliminal messaging]] and their work is full of cryptic messages including references to [[numerology]] and [[cult]] figures such as [[David Koresh]] of the [[Branch Davidians]].<ref name="brown">Brown, Colin.
