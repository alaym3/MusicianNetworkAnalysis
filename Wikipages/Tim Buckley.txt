'''Timothy Charles Buckley III''' (February 14, 1947 – June 29, 1975) was an American guitarist, singer, songwriter, and producer. His music and style changed considerably through the years. Buckley began his career based in [[folk music]], but his subsequent albums experimented with [[jazz]], [[Psychedelic music|psychedelia]], [[funk]], [[soul music|soul]], the [[avant-garde]], and an evolving voice-as-instrument sound. He died at the age of 28 from a [[heroin]] and [[morphine]] overdose, leaving behind sons Taylor and [[Jeff Buckley|Jeff]].

== Early life and career ==
Tim Buckley was born in [[Washington, D.C.]] on [[Valentine's Day]], February 14, 1947, to Elaine (née Scalia), an Italian American, and Timothy Charles Buckley Jr., a decorated [[World War II]] veteran and son of Irish immigrants from [[County Cork|Cork]]. He spent his early childhood in [[Amsterdam (city), New York|Amsterdam]], [[New York (state)|New York]], an industrial city about {{Convert|40|mi}} northwest of [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. At five years old, Buckley began listening to his mother's progressive jazz recordings, particularly [[Miles Davis]].

Buckley's musical life began after his family moved to [[Bell Gardens]] in southern California in 1956. His grandmother introduced him to the work of [[Bessie Smith]] and [[Billie Holiday]], his mother to [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Judy Garland]] and his father to the country music of [[Hank Williams]] and [[Johnny Cash]].<ref name=HighFlyer>{{cite web|first=Martin |last=Aston |title=The High |url=http://home.casema.nl/jim2873/timbuckley/highflyer.html |access-date=May 4, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022004931/http://home.casema.nl/jim2873/timbuckley/highflyer.html |archive-date=October 22, 2008 }}</ref> When the [[American folk music revival|folk music revolution]] came around in the early 1960s, Buckley taught himself the banjo at age 13, and with several friends formed a folk group inspired by the [[Kingston Trio]] that played local high school events.<ref name=Enotes>{{cite web |title="Tim Buckley Biography" by Simon Glickman at ''enotes.com'' |url=http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-musicians/buckley-tim-biography |access-date=May 19, 2008}}</ref>

During high school, Buckley was elected to class offices, played on the baseball team and quarterbacked the football team.<ref name=Chronology>{{cite web |title="Tim Buckley Chronology 1947–97" by Robert Niemi |url=http://www.timbuckley.net/chronology.htm|website=Timbuckley.net|access-date=May 19, 2008}}</ref> During a football game, he broke two fingers on his left hand, permanently damaging them. He said that the injury prevented him from playing [[barre chords]]. This disability may have led to his use of [[extended chords]], many of which don't require barres.<ref name=TBBioLU>{{cite web|title=''Tim Buckley Biography'' by Lee Underwood |url=http://www.timbuckley.com/biography |access-date=May 12, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105094037/http://www.timbuckley.com/biography/ |archive-date=January 5, 2011}}</ref> However, this disability claim seems to be invalidated because Buckley's performance on the final episode of the television show, ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'', broadcast on March 25, 1968, clearly shows Buckley using a barre chord while performing "[[Song to the Siren]]" on an out-of-tune 12-string guitar.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

Buckley attended [[Loara High School]] in [[Anaheim, California]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Man that Got Away by Dave Peschek|url=http://www.timbuckley.net/articles/tbmojo3.htm|access-date=June 3, 2008|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080422191839/http://www.timbuckley.net/articles/tbmojo3.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date =April 22, 2008}}</ref> He cut classes regularly and quit football, focusing most of his attention on music. He befriended [[Larry Beckett]], his future lyricist, and [[Jim Fielder]], a bass player with whom he formed two musical groups, the Bohemians, who initially played popular music,<ref name=Dreamy>{{cite magazine |title=Dreamy, Driven and Dangerous |author=Ben Edmonds |magazine=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]|date=June 2000 |url=http://www.home.zonnet.nl/jim2873/tb/dreamy.swf |access-date=November 3, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924031107/http://www.home.zonnet.nl/jim2873/tb/dreamy.swf |archive-date=September 24, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and the Harlequin 3, a folk group which regularly incorporated [[spoken word]] and [[beat poetry]] into their gigs.<ref name=HighFlyer/>

Buckley and lyricist/friend Beckett wrote dozens of songs, some that appeared on Tim's debut album, ''Tim Buckley''. "Buzzin' Fly" was written during this period and was featured on ''[[Happy Sad (album)|Happy Sad]]'', his 1969 [[LP record|LP]].<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

Buckley's college career at [[Fullerton College]] lasted two weeks in 1965.<ref name=Enotes/><ref name=Chronology/> After dropping out of college, Buckley dedicated himself fully to music and playing L.A. folk clubs. During the summer of 1965, he played regularly at a club co-founded by Dan Gordon. He played Orange County coffeehouses such as the White Room in Buena Park and the Monday-night hootenannies at the Los Angeles [[Troubadour]].<ref>''Musician'' magazine article by Scott Isler, The Tim Buckley Archives.</ref> That year, ''Cheetah'' magazine deemed Buckley one of "The Orange County Three", along with Steve Noonan and [[Jackson Browne]].<ref name=HighFlyer/>

In February 1966, following a gig at It's Boss, [[the Mothers of Invention]]'s drummer [[Jimmy Carl Black]] recommended Buckley to the Mothers' manager, [[Herb Cohen]] who saw potential in Tim<ref name=Enotes/> and landed him an extended gig at the Night Owl Cafe in [[Greenwich Village]] at West 3rd and MacDougal. Buckley's girlfriend, Jainie Goldstein, drove him to New York.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> While living in the [[Bowery]] with Jainie, Buckley ran into [[Lee Underwood]] and asked him to play guitar for him. The two became lifelong friends and collaborators.

Under Cohen's management, Buckley recorded a six-song demo [[acetate disc]] which he sent to [[Elektra records]] owner [[Jac Holzman]],<ref name=HighFlyer/><ref name=Dreamy/> who offered him a recording contract.<ref name=Enotes/>

== Folk rock ==
In August 1966, Buckley recorded his [[Tim Buckley (album)|self-titled debut album]] in three days in Los Angeles. He was often unhappy with his albums after they were recorded and described his debut album as "like [[Disneyland]]".<ref name=HighFlyer/> The record featured Buckley and a band of Underwood and [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] friends. Underwood's mix of jazz and country improvisation on a [[Telecaster]] guitar became a distinctive part of Buckley's early sound. Jac Holzman and [[Paul Rothchild]]'s [[Producer (music)|production]] and [[Jack Nitzsche]]'s string [[arrangements]] cemented the record's mid-'60s sound.

The album's folk-rock style was typical of the time, although many people, including Underwood, felt the strings by Nitzsche "did not enhance its musical quality."<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Critics took note of Buckley's distinctive voice and tuneful compositions.<ref name=Enotes/>

{{listen|type=music|filename=Tim Buckley - Song of The Magician.ogg|title="Song of The Magician"|description=from ''[[Tim Buckley (album)|Tim Buckley]]''<br>Demonstrating the sixties sound of the record}}

Underwood considered the record to be "a first effort, naive, stiff, quaky and innocent [but] a ticket into the marketplace".<ref name=TBBioLU/> Holzman expressed similar sentiments and thought Buckley wasn't comfortable in his own musical skin.<ref name=Enotes/> Larry Beckett suggested the band's desire to please audiences held it back.<ref name=Dreamy/>

Elektra released two [[single (music)|singles]] promoting the debut album, "Wings" with "Grief in My Soul" as the [[B-side]], and "Aren't You the Girl"/"Strange Street Affair Under Blue." Buckley followed with "Once Upon a Time" and "Lady Give Me Your Key", which were not well regarded but showed potential.<ref name=LBInterview>{{cite web |title=Larry Beckett Interview: April 3, 1999 |url=http://www.richieunterberger.com/beckett.html|website=Richieunterberger.com |access-date=May 26, 2008}}</ref> Elektra decided not to release the songs as singles, and the songs remained in Elektra's record vaults. [[Rhino Records]] was unable to find "Lady Give Me Your Key" to include on its ''[[Morning Glory: The Tim Buckley Anthology]]'',<ref name=Dreamy/> but the song was the title track on Light in the Attic Records' 2017 collection of the previously unissued 1967 acoustic sessions. "Once Upon A Time" surfaced on Rhino's ''Where The Action Is 1965–68 Los Angeles'' anthology in 2009.

''[[Goodbye and Hello (Tim Buckley album)|Goodbye and Hello]]'', released in 1967, featured late 1960s-style poetry and songs in different [[time signature|timings]], and was an ambitious release for the 20-year-old Buckley.<ref name=HighFlyer/><ref name=Isler>{{cite web |last=Isler|first=Scott|title=Goodbye and Hello |publisher=Musician |url=http://www.timbuckley.net/articles/tbgh.htm |access-date=June 20, 2008|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080518121555/http://www.timbuckley.net/articles/tbgh.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=May 18, 2008}}</ref> Reflecting the confidence Elektra had in Buckley and group, they were given free rein on the content of the album.<ref name=LBInterview/> Beckett continued as lyricist and the album consisted of Buckley originals and Beckett–Buckley collaborations. Critics noted the improved lyrical and melodic qualities of Buckley's music.<ref name=GodBless>{{cite web |last=Hopkins |first=Jerry |title=And God Bless Tim Buckley Too |url=http://www.timbuckley.net/articles/tbhopkins.htm |access-date=June 20, 2008|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080521011356/http://www.timbuckley.net/articles/tbhopkins.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=May 21, 2008}}</ref> Buckley's voice had developed since his last release and the press appreciated both his lower [[vocal register|register]] and [[falsetto]] in equal measure.<ref name=Isler/>

|filename2=Tim Buckley - Pleasant Street.ogg|title2="Pleasant Street"|description2=both tracks from ''[[Goodbye and Hello (Tim Buckley album)|Goodbye and Hello]]''}}

The subject of the album distinguished it from its predecessor. Beckett addressed the psychological nature of war in "No Man Can Find the War",<ref name=LBInterview/> and Underwood welcomed Buckley's entry into darker territory with "Pleasant Street".<ref name=TBBioLU/> "I Never Asked to Be Your Mountain" represented a confessional lyric to his estranged wife and child,<ref name=Isler/> while the mix of introspective folk songs and political-themed content attracted folk fans and anti-war audiences.<ref name=TBBioLU/> Holzman had faith in Buckley and rented advertising space for the musician on the [[Sunset Strip]], an unusual step for a solo act.<ref name=GodBless/> Buckley distanced himself from comparisons to [[Bob Dylan]], expressing an apathy toward Dylan and his work.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jay|last=Hoster|title=Tim Buckley: "An incredibly thin wire – Dylan thin"|newspaper=[[The Haverford News]] |url=http://www.timbuckley.net/articles/tbhoster.htm |access-date=June 3, 2008|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080422075142/http://www.timbuckley.net/articles/tbhoster.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=April 22, 2008|via=timbuckley.net}}</ref> While ''Goodbye and Hello'' did not make Buckley a star, it performed better in the charts than his previous effort, peaking at No. 171.<ref name=Isler/>

Buckley's higher profile led to his album ''The Best of Tim Buckley'' being used as a soundtrack to the 1969 film ''[[Changes (1969 film)|Changes]]''. Buckley performed "[[Song to the Siren]]" on the final episode of ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]''.<ref name=HighFlyer/><ref name=Isler/> Buckley was wary of the press and often avoided interviews.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Sander|first=Ellen|title=The Growing Mystique of Tim Buckley |magazine=Hit Parader |url=http://www.timbuckley.net/articles/tbparader.htm |access-date=June 20, 2008|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080519013512/http://www.timbuckley.net/articles/tbparader.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=May 19, 2008|via=timbuckley.net}}</ref> After a slot on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'', Buckley was standoffish and insulting toward [[Johnny Carson]], and on another television appearance refused to [[lip sync]] to "Pleasant Street".<ref name=HighFlyer/>

After Beckett was drafted into the Army, Buckley developed his own style, and described the jazz/[[blues]]-rock with which he was associated as "white thievery and an emotional sham."<ref name=TBBioLU/> Drawing inspiration from jazz greats such as [[Charles Mingus]], [[Thelonious Monk]], [[Roland Kirk]], and vocalist [[Leon Thomas]], Buckley's sound became different from previous recordings.

In 1968, Buckley toured Europe twice, first including Denmark, the Netherlands, and England, appearing e.g. on [[John Peel]]'s ''[[Top Gear (radio show)|Top Gear]]'' radio show on the [[BBC]] and then appearing at the {{ill|Internationale Essener Songtage|de}} in Germany, as well as touring England and Denmark again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timbuckley.net/bios/timeline2.shtml|title=Tim Buckley – A Chronology, 1967–1968|author=Robert Niemi|website=timbuckley.net|access-date=August 19, 2019}}</ref> Later that year, he recorded ''[[Happy Sad (album)|Happy Sad]]'', which reflected folk and jazz influences and would be his best-charting album, peaking at No. 81.

== Middle period ==
During 1969, Buckley began to write and record material for three albums, ''[[Blue Afternoon]]'', ''[[Lorca (album)|Lorca]]'', and ''[[Starsailor (album)|Starsailor]]''. Inspired by the singing of avant-garde musician [[Cathy Berberian]], he integrated the ideas of composers such as [[Luciano Berio]] and [[Iannis Xenakis]] in an avant-garde rock genre. Buckley selected eight songs for ''[[Blue Afternoon]]'', an album similar to ''Happy Sad'' in style.<ref name= LUInterviewPP>{{cite web |title=Interview with Lee Underwood |url=http://www.leeunderwood.net/Interviews/06_prepubinterview.html|website=Leeunderwood.net |access-date=April 29, 2008}}</ref> In a 1977 article for ''[[DownBeat]]'' magazine, [[Lee Underwood]] wrote that Buckley's heart was not in ''Blue Afternoon'' and that the album was a perfunctory response to please his business partners.<ref name=LUInterviewSS>{{cite web |title=''Starsailor Interview'' by Lee Underwood |url=http://www.leeunderwood.net/Interviews/05_starsailor.html |website=Leeunderwood.net|access-date=May 17, 2008}}</ref>

While Buckley's music never sold well, his following releases did indeed chart. ''Lorca'' alienated his folk base while ''Blue Afternoon'' was criticized as boring and tepid, and "[not] even good sulking music." ''Blue Afternoon'' was Buckley's last album to chart on ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'', reaching No. 192. Following the albums, Buckley began to focus on what he felt to be his masterpiece, ''Starsailor''.

''Starsailor'' contained [[free jazz]] textures under Buckley's most extreme vocal performance, ranging from high shrieks to deep, soulful baritone. This personal album included the more accessible "[[Song to the Siren (Tim Buckley song)|Song to the Siren]]", a song which has since been covered by [[This Mortal Coil]], [[Robert Plant]], [[John Frusciante]], [[Bryan Ferry]] and [[Brendan Perry]]. The album was a critical and commercial failure.

Unable to produce his music and almost broke, Buckley turned to alcohol and drug binges. He considered acting and completed an unreleased low-budget film entitled ''Why?'' (1971).<ref>{{Cite web|date=October 29, 2014|title=Tim Buckley in a movie 'Why' (rare video)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCHNn5j4XL8|url-status=live|access-date=April 25, 2021|website=YouTube}}</ref> The film was an experimental use of the new medium [[video tape]] and was commissioned by [[Technicolor]].<ref name=HighFlyer/>

== "Sex funk" period ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2019}}
In 1970, Buckley disbanded his ''Starsailor'' ensemble and assembled a new [[funk]] band. He cut three albums, ''[[Greetings from L.A.]]'', ''[[Sefronia]]'' and ''[[Look at the Fool]]''. Buckley alienated much of his [[hippie]] fan base with his previous two albums, and his sexually frank lyrics ("whip me, spank me") prevented the songs from receiving airplay, although he retained a [[cult following]].

In 1975, Buckley engaged the press regarding a live album comeback. He began performing revamped versions of material drawn from his career, except ''Starsailor'' and ''[[Lorca (album)|Lorca]],'' as a response to his audience, which he had spurned in the past.

== Death ==
On June 28, 1975, Buckley completed a short tour with a show in [[Dallas]], playing to a sold-out crowd of 1,800 people.<ref name=HighFlyer/> He celebrated the end of the tour with a weekend of drinking with his band and friends. On the night of June 29, he accompanied longtime friend Richard Keeling to his house. At some point, Keeling produced a bag of heroin,<ref name=TBBioLU/> some of which Buckley injected.

Buckley's friends took him home and, seeing his inebriated state, his wife Judy lay him on the living-room floor and questioned his friends as to what had happened.<ref name=TBBioLU/> She moved Buckley into bed. When she checked on him later, she found that he was not breathing and had turned blue. Attempts by friends and [[paramedic]]s to revive him were unsuccessful, and he was pronounced [[dead on arrival]].<ref name=HighFlyer/>

The [[coroner]]'s report stated that Buckley died at 9:42&nbsp;p.m. on June 29, 1975, from "acute heroin/[[morphine]] and [[ethanol]] intoxication due to inhalation and ingestion of overdose".<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Judith|last=Sims|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/tim-buckley-dead-at-28-19750814|title=Tim Buckley Dead at 28|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=August 14, 1975|access-date=December 10, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190413041248/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/tim-buckley-dead-at-28-94675/|archive-date=April 13, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Aftermath ==
Buckley's [[tour manager]], Bob Duffy, said Buckley's death was not expected, but "was like watching a movie, and that was its natural ending."<ref name=HighFlyer/>

Other friends saw his passing as predictable, if not inevitable. Beckett recalled how Buckley took chances with his life, including dangerous driving, drinking alcohol, taking pills and heroin.

Given the circumstances of his death, police charged Keeling with murder and [[drug dealing|distribution of heroin]].<ref name=NYTdeath>{{cite news |title=Suspect Arraigned in Death of Singer |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 9, 1975|url=http://www.timbuckley.net/articles/tbjuly2.htm |access-date=July 3, 2008|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080519225923/http://www.timbuckley.net/articles/tbjuly2.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=May 19, 2008}}</ref> At his hearing on August 14, 1975, Keeling pleaded guilty to [[involuntary manslaughter]]<ref name=NYTdeath/><ref>{{cite news |title=Stude Gets Probation in Death of Singer Buckley |newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 9, 1976 |url=http://www.timbuckley.net/articles/tbstude.htm |access-date=June 3, 2008|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080518211030/http://www.timbuckley.net/articles/tbstude.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=May 18, 2008}}</ref> and, after failing to complete community service, was sentenced to 120 days in jail and four years' probation.<ref>{{cite news |title=Penal Aftermath of Tim Buckley's Death |newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|date= March 23, 1976 |url= http://www.timbuckley.net/articles/tbob.htm|access-date=June 6, 2008|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080519012510/http://www.timbuckley.net/articles/tbob.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date =May 19, 2008}}</ref>

Buckley died in debt, owning only a guitar and an [[amplifier]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timbuckley.com/tim-buckley-chronicle-of-a-starsailor/|title=Tim Buckley: Chronicle of a Starsailor|website=Timbuckley.com|access-date=December 10, 2017}}</ref> About 200 friends and family attended his funeral at the Wilshire Funeral Home in Santa Monica, including manager [[Herb Cohen]] and [[Lee Underwood]]. His 8-year-old son, [[Jeff Buckley|Jeff]], had met his father only once, and was not invited to the funeral. Jeff Buckley said not being invited to his father's funeral "gnawed" at him, and prompted him to pay his respects by performing "[[Goodbye and Hello (Tim Buckley album)|I Never Asked to Be Your Mountain]]" in 1991 at a memorial tribute to Buckley in [[Brooklyn]], six years before his own accidental death.<ref>Rogers R.

==Personal life==
During French class in 1964, Buckley met Mary Guibert. Their relationship inspired some of Buckley's music, and provided him time away from his turbulent home life. His father suffered a head injury during the war which, along with a severe work-related injury, was said to have affected his mental balance.<ref name="ReferenceA">Blue Melody, Lee Underwood, Tim Buckley Biography</ref> Falsely believing Guibert to be pregnant, the couple married on October 25, 1965.<ref name=Chronology/> The marriage was tumultuous and Buckley moved out, but Guibert soon became pregnant. Buckley found himself neither willing nor able to cope with marriage and fatherhood, and the couple saw each other sporadically. They divorced in October 1966, about a month before their son, [[Jeff Buckley|Jeff]], was born.<ref name="ReferenceB">Chronology by Robert Niemi, The Tim Buckley Archives</ref>

In April 1970, Buckley married Judy Brejot Sutcliffe in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], and adopted her son, Taylor Keith Sutcliffe.
