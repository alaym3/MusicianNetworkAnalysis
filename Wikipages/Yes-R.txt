'''Yesser Roshdy''' ({{lang-ary|ياسر رشدي}}, {{IPA-ar|jesəɾ ɾoʃdi|}}; born 2 November 1986), better known by his stage name '''Yes-R''', is a Dutch [[rapping|rapper]] and television presenter. He is of [[Morocco|Moroccan]] and [[Egypt|Egyptian]] descent. Before going solo, he was part of the Dutch hip-hop formation [[D-Men]]. He has also appeared in the films ''[['n Beetje Verliefd]]'' and ''Gangsterboys''.

==Early career==
Yes-R originates from [[Amsterdam-Oost|East Amsterdam]]. Inspired by his cousin [[Ali B]], he started rapping at the age of 12. A year later, he entered a talent show in which he placed second. In 2003, he was introduced to [[Lange Frans]], the frontman of the rap formation [[D-Men]], who was impressed by Yes-R's flow. Lange Frans then took on the production of Yes-R's recordings. The first song ''Chickiesflasher'' was an underground hit and became part of the compilation album ''De gastenlijst''. He was also featured on the single  ''Sletje'' by [[Baas B]] as well Maritza's debut single ''Laat Je Gaan''.

In 2004, Yes-R won the audience award of ''De Grote Prijs van Nederland''. He also contributed to the [[D-Men]] mixtapes ''De Straatremixes Deel 2'' and ''De Straatremixes Deel 3''.

==Solo career==
[[Image:Yes-R.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Yes-R with Soesi B, Derenzo and DJ Kesh]]
Yes-R decided to leave D-Men in 2005 alongside most of its members after disagreements with the ''D-Men Entertainment'' record label, and its founding owners, namely rapper [[Lange Frans]] and rapper-singer [[Baas B]]. He signed instead to his cousin [[Ali B]]'s record label. Yes-R never discussed the details of the commercial conflict with D-Men, but hinted to it in his song "Het spijt me" ("I'm sorry")

In 2005, his debut solo album ''Mijn pad'' ("My Path") was soon released where Yes-R is autobiographical telling his personal story about his life, visions and future prospects. He worked along with [[Soesi B]] as a backup vocalist and with [[Derenzo]] and [[DJ Kesh]]. He also toured throughout the Netherlands to promote his solo career. His concurrent first single with ''Mijn pad'' was released in March 2005 called "Stel je voor" featuring [[Baas B]].

But far more notorious for chart success was the [[Ali B]] famous track "Leipe mocro flavour" {{YouTube|83mJmw3yH3A}} with [[Brace (singer)|Brace]] and [[Ali B]], "mocro" meaning "person of Moroccan descent". It was released just days before the debut single. The Ali B single took him to No. 2 in Dutch Singles Chart and a No. 3 position in the [[Mega Top 50]].

Yes-R begins has been able to target a broad audience and appears through his DVD releases. He is regularly featured not only on urban-oriented programs, but also makes an effort to take part in children shows and talk shows and has become one of the best selling rapper acts in Netherlands, winning many awards including [[TMF Award (Netherlands)|TMF Award]] for "Best Newcomer" in 2006. Although Yes-R is successful on the charts, he has been suffering from stream of criticism about his commercialism by some other Dutch hip hop personalities and the Dutch people..

In June 2008, Yes-R had a chart-topping hit in [[Suriname]] entitled  "Uit Elkaar" ("Breaking Up"). It also had success in the Netherlands, reaching No. 14.

Along with rapper [[Akon]] and [[Ali B]], he made a remix of the song "[[Ghetto (Akon song)|Ghetto]]" with additional rap verses in [[Dutch language|Dutch]].

In 2009, he had a joint hit with Moroccan rapper [[Soesi B]] and [[Darryl (rapper)|Darryl]].

In 2009, Yes-R made a voiceover role in the animated film ''Sunshine Barry en de discowormen'' playing the part of Tito, a bassist in the band, in one of the leading role alongside those of Jim and Sita.
