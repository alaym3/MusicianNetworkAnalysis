'''Leonard Charles Williams''' (born February 16, 1945)<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/lenny-williams-mn0000818254 "Biography by Alex Henderson"], AllMusic.</ref> is an American singer-songwriter and musician, best known as the lead vocalist for the soul/funk group [[Tower of Power]] in the early 1970s. As a solo artist, Williams made several hit [[sound recording and reproduction|recordings]], including 1978's "Cause I Love You" and 1977's "Choosing You".

==Early life and career==
Williams was born in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], and moved to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], California, before the age of 1.<ref name=lennywilliams>{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Lenny|title=Meet Lenny|url=http://www.lennywilliams.com/meet-lenny/|accessdate=April 15, 2011}}</ref> Learning to play the trumpet in elementary school fueled his interest in music; his skills as a vocalist were first nurtured by singing in gospel choirs and groups around the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]]. He worked with several notable artists, such as [[Sly Stone]], [[Andrae Crouch|Andra√© Crouch]], [[Billy Preston]] and members of the Hawkins family, [[Edwin Hawkins|Edwin]], [[Walter Hawkins|Walter]] and [[Tramaine Hawkins|Tramaine]].

==Professional recordings==
After winning several local [[talent contest]]s, Williams signed his first [[recording contract]] with [[Fantasy Records]].  He cut two [[single (music)|singles]] for the label, including "Lisa's Gone" and "Feelin Blue", written by [[John Fogerty]] of [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]]. In 1972, Williams joined the emerging [[funk]] band Tower of Power.  A string of hits followed, including "[[So Very Hard to Go]]", "What Is Hip", "Don't Change Horses (In The Middle of the Stream)" and "Willing To Learn".  During his two years with the group, Williams participated in three albums: ''Back To Oakland'', ''Urban Renewal'' and the [[music recording sales certification|gold]] LP ''Tower of Power''. Williams and Tower of Power toured throughout the United States, Europe and Asia.

==Solo works==
While still with Tower of Power, he recorded his first solo album ''Pray for the Lion'' for [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1974. At the end of 1975, Williams left the band and returned to his solo projects.  Initially signing with [[Motown Records]] in 1975, he later moved to [[ABC Records]] in 1977 (which was then purchased by [[MCA Records]] in 1979).  With producer Frank Wilson at the helm and songwriters such as Judy Wieder, Clay Drayton, Terry McFadden, and John Footman, over the next four years, he scored ten [[record chart|chart]] hits, including "Shoo Doo FuFu Ooh", "Choosing You", "You Got Me Running", "Love Hurt Me Love Healed Me", "Here's to the Lady," and "Midnight Girl". Williams recorded four more albums from 1977 to 1980: ''Choosing You'', his first gold LP; ''Spark of Love'' (contains the hits "You Got Me Running", and "Cause I Love You" as well as "Midnight Girl"); ''Love Current''; "Taking Chances" and ''Let's Do It Today''.

After leaving MCA, Williams recorded for the [[independent record label]]s, Rockshire and Knobhill. In 1986, he was invited to sing vocals on "[[Don't Make Me Wait For Love]]", a track from ''[[Duotones]]'', a multi-platinum recording by [[Kenny G]]. The song became a [[Top 40|Top 20]] [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] hit the following year.

His 1978 hit song "Cause I Love You" was [[sampling (music)|sampled]] by Havoc of [[Mobb Deep]] for the track "Nothing Like Home", and by [[Kanye West]] for the songs "[[Overnight Celebrity]]" by [[Twista]] and "[[The Rest Is History|I Got A Love]]" by [[Jin (rapper)|Jin]]. The track was sampled a fourth time in 2007 by [[Scarface (rapper)|Scarface]] for his single "Girl You Know" featuring [[Trey Songz]] & [[Young Jeezy]] [[sampling (music)|sampled]] "Let's Talk It Over" for his single "I Do" featuring [[Jay-Z]] and [[Andre 3000]]. His song "Half Past Love" was also sampled by [[The Coup]] for their 2006 single "My Favorite Mutiny" featuring [[Black Thought]] of [[The Roots]] and [[Talib Kweli]] of [[Black Star (group)|Black Star]].

Since that time, Williams has continued his solo career, touring the US, Europe and South Africa, and has also expanded his career to include acting, starring in several stage plays, including ''Love on Lay Away'' starring [[Deborah Cox]], [[Mel Jackson]] and [[Martha Wash]]; ''What Men Don't Tell'' starring [[Kenny Lattimore]], Chante Moore, and [[Dottie Peoples]]; and ''When A Woman's Fed Up''. He is also one of the featured artists on Urbanland Music's DVD ''The Big Show'', recorded at the Orpheum Theatre in Boston, Massachusetts, on November 29, 2002.
