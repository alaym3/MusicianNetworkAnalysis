'''Fear Before''' (formerly known as '''Fear Before the March of Flames''') is an [[experimental rock]]  band formed in [[Aurora, Colorado]]. As stated on their Alternative Press podcast,<ref name="Podcast">{{cite web| title= Alternative Press Podcast| publisher= altpress.com| url= http://altpress.com/podcast/ | access-date= August 24, 2007}}</ref> their name originates from a [[Denver Post]] newspaper headline about the 2002 [[Hayman fire]] titled "The Fear Before The March of Flames." They released their debut album ''[[Odd How People Shake]]'' in 2003 with a re-release in January 2004, second album ''[[Art Damage]]'' in September 2004, third album ''[[The Always Open Mouth]]'' in September 2006, and fourth album ''[[Fear Before (album)|Fear Before]]'' in October 2008. In 2010 the band announced they were going into an indefinite hiatus.

==Biography==

===''Odd How People Shake'' (2002-2003)===
In 2002, Fear Before the March of Flames was formed in [[Aurora, Colorado|Aurora]], [[Colorado]] with vocalist David Marion, guitarist/vocalist Adam Fisher, bassist Michael Madruga, and drummer Brandon Proff.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web| title= Biography| publisher= allmusic.com| url= {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p637903|pure_url=yes}} | access-date= August 20, 2007}}</ref> The original members all met at [[Smoky Hill High School]] in Aurora. However, Adam is the only Colorado native. The band took their name from a local newspaper headline when wildfires swept through their state. The band drew inspiration from bands such as [[Botch (band)|Botch]], [[Converge (band)|Converge]] and [[The Blood Brothers (band)|The Blood Brothers]] in creating their music. Prior to forming Fear Before, Adam, Mike, and Brandon were in a pop-punk band together called thirtysixflip. David was their merchandise guy. After they decided to pursue a more abrasive post-hardcore/mathcore direction, David joined, and Fear Before the March of Flames was born.<ref name="Gauntlet">{{cite web| title= Fear Before the March of Flames Bio| publisher= The Gauntlet| url= http://www.thegauntlet.com/bio/3579/Fear-Before-The-March-Of-Flames.html | access-date= August 20, 2007}}</ref>

The band played their first show on August 1, 2002.<ref>{{cite web| title=Fear Before - Facebook | publisher=facebook.com| date=August 1, 2010| url=http://www.facebook.com/fearbefore?v=wall&story_fbid=120313144682789 | access-date=August 24, 2007}}</ref> In July and October 2002, the band recorded their three-song debut EP with Jason Anderson at Grey Music Recording Company in Thornton, Colorado. The band sold copies of this EP on their early tours, which garnered the attention of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] based [[Rise Records]]. Once signed to Rise, the band released their debut album ''[[Odd How People Shake]]'' in July 2003. They gained notoriety outside of Colorado from tours with bands such as The Blood Brothers and [[Hopesfall]].<ref name="AMG"/> However, it was on the tour with the band [[Bear vs. Shark]] when they were noticed and then signed to the more prominent [[Equal Vision Records]], who re-released their debut in January 2004.<ref name="Bear">{{cite web| title= Fear Before the March of Flames| publisher= absolutepunk.net| date= December 21, 2006| url= http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=198435| access-date= October 12, 2007}}</ref> Their debut was primarily in the vein of [[post-hardcore]], featuring a mix of screamed vocals on the part of David Michael Marion and clean singing provided by Adam Rupert Fisher. It is rumoured that every song on the album is based on a movie ("Sarah Goldfarb, Where are Your Manners?", for example, is about ''[[Requiem for a Dream]]'').

In concert, the band plays few, if any, songs from their debut. On their website, they explicitly state that they will not play one song in particular from their debut, "On the Brightside, She Could Choke;". However, on October 30, 2007 at a show in Houston, Texas, they played an acoustic set at Warehouse Live that included "On the Brightside." Due to a loss in drummer Clayton Holyoak's family, the band decided to play an acoustic set because they were at a loss of percussion.

On September 5, 2008 at an intimate hometown show in Denver, during their encore, Fear Before asked the audience what song they wanted to hear. Unanimously, the entire audience started to chant for "Brightside". After some hesitation, the band played the song in its original form for the first time since 2003. The band has also played this song twice since this show, once in Anaheim, California, and again in Denver.

===''Art Damage'' (2004-2005)===
From late July 2004 to mid-August 2004, the band played with Evergreen Terrace and [[I Killed the Prom Queen]] on the Radiotakeover Tour. The band also played select dates with [[Norma Jean (band)|Norma Jean]] in August and October as well. In August, the band recorded a live EP at The Epicentre in [[San Diego, California]], titled ''[[Live at the Epicentre]]'', which was released in September.

Their second album, ''[[Art Damage]]'', was released on Equal Vision Records in September 2004, and was a marked change in direction for the band. ''Art Damage'' featured "a much more straightforward, significantly harder style."<ref name="Art">{{cite web| title= Art Damage| publisher= punknews.org| url= http://www.punknews.org/review/3417 | access-date= August 20, 2007}}</ref> Different from the earlier material, FBTMOF changed from the original [[Indie rock|indie]] [[post-hardcore]] sound to more of a [[mathcore]] based sound. The video for the single "Should Have Stayed in the Shallows" was filmed in the same basement as the one used in the film ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]''<ref name="Fight Club">{{cite web| title= Fear Before The March of Flames New Video, Tour Dates| website=Metalunderground.com| url= http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=12982 | access-date= August 20, 2007}}</ref> and was heavily rotated on [[MTV2]]'s show ''Headbanger's Ball''.<ref name="Fear Before">{{cite web| title= Artist Info| publisher= Equal Vision| url= http://equalvision.com/artist/Fear_Before_The_March_of_Flames| access-date= August 20, 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070911022411/http://www.equalvision.com/artist/Fear_Before_The_March_of_Flames| archive-date= September 11, 2007| url-status= dead}}</ref>

Through April 2005, the band toured with [[Underoath]] and [[The Chariot (band)|The Chariot]]. The band also played on the Sounds of the Underground tour on Midwest and Southeast dates.

On October 18, 2005, [[Immortal Records]] released the soundtrack for the ''[[Masters of Horror]]'' television series. Fear Before the March of Flames provided a previously unreleased song, "[[237 (song)|237]]", for the soundtrack. The song took its name from the infamous room number from the film ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]].'' It was featured in the credits for the [[Tobe Hooper]]-directed episode ''[[Dance of the Dead (Masters of Horror episode)|Dance of the Dead]]''.

===''The Always Open Mouth'' (2006-2007)===
In June 2006, the band played at the [[7 Angels 7 Plagues]] Reunion Show, and in August they played at the Dirt Fest.

Their third studio album, ''[[The Always Open Mouth]]'', was released on September 19, 2006. Fischer explains that the title of the album refers to people who act like "An all-knowing super being from another realm sent here to save us all, or be a fucking loud mouth bigot. They are ''The Always Open Mouth''."<ref name="Fear Before"/> This album marks a considerably different sound from previous recordings, containing a much more experimental side with more emphasis on [[antiphony]] between the lead vocalist Marion, and guitarist/vocalist Fisher, and a considerably lesser amount of screaming. It is described as "boldly experimental and brimming with musical complexity".<ref name="Fear Before"/> The band has replied to fan response that found the album to be a large departure from the sound of ''Art Damage'' by stating that they "just wanted to do something we hadn't done before."<ref name="Bear"/>

The first single from the album was the song "Taking Cassandra to the End of the World Party", and a video was also filmed with director David Bell. The song references the Greek legend of [[Cassandra]], a woman who possessed the gift of [[prophecy]], but was cursed by the fact that no one would believe her tellings.

Proff left the band to pursue a teaching career and drummer Clayton "Goose" Holyoak, guitarist Zach "Binks" Hutchings, and guitarist/keyboardist Billy Johnson were added.<ref name="AMG"/>

From October 2006 to December 2006, the band played with previous tour-mates Norma Jean, and [[Between the Buried and Me]], on the first ever Radio Rebellion Tour. In March 2007, the band played a portion of the [[Russian Circles]] Plan Midwest Tour and played one day at the Appalachian Annihilation Festival. That month the band again changed their lineup. They stated that Billy Johnson (touring guitarist) left the band due to personal reasons.

In July/August 2007 the band embarked on their first headlining tour with [[65daysofstatic]], [[This Will Destroy You]], and [[Hot Cross]] as support. For this tour they released a limited edition EP entitled ''A Little Less Teeth'', featuring live sessions, outtakes, and demos.

The band had planned to release a DVD titled ''Absolute Past, Absolute Future'' with an estimated release date of Spring 2007. The DVD would cover the band's touring before they recorded ''The Always Open Mouth'' and the two months spent in [[Seattle]] recording the album. Fear Before the March of Flames explained that the DVD will not be "random live footage from four years [...] followed by random live footage from three years ago".<ref name="Bear"/> ''Absolute Past, Absolute Future'' would be presented in documentary form, telling the history of the band chronologically. However, the footage was lost and the release was scrapped.

===Fear Before (2008-2009)===
In the January 2008 issue of ''Alternative Press'', the band was featured as having one of the most anticipated albums of the year. The album, titled ''Fear Before'', was recorded in Seattle, WA at Johnny Cab Studios with producer Casey Bates ([[Gatsbys American Dream]], [[Portugal. The Man]], [[The Fall of Troy (band)|The Fall of Troy]]) during June and July 2008 and was released October 28, 2008.<ref>[http://www.jacobthewar.com/fearbefore/ New album release & tour dates] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009184718/http://www.jacobthewar.com/fearbefore/ |date=October 9, 2008 }} Retrieved on July 6, 2008</ref>

The self-titled album marked many changes for the band. This is the first album on which lead vocalist Dave Marion contributed the majority of lyrics. In the past, guitarist and back-up vocalist Adam Fisher had written the majority of the lyrics. In contrast to their previous work, most of Dave's vocals on this album are sung as opposed to screamed. This is the first album to feature current drummer Clayton 'Goose' Holyoak, as well as the first and last album where Zachary 'Binks' Hutchings had a substantial role in the writing of a Fear Before album. He had previously played on ''[[The Always Open Mouth]]'' but did not contribute to writing. The album features guest vocals by a number of people,  most notably Thomas Erak from [[The Fall Of Troy]] as well as Zachary Carothers of [[Portugal. The Man]], Robert Smith of [[Heavy Heavy Low Low]], Quentin Smith of [[Vaux (band)|Vaux]], and Dreu Damian of [[I Am The Ocean]]. One of the songs from the album, "Review Our Lives", is a revised version of "Epic Song", which was previously released as a live session on their ''A Little Less Teeth'' EP.

In September 2008 they embarked on a headlining tour with [[Damiera]] and [[I Am the Ocean]] as support.<ref name="Tour 2008">{{cite web| title= Fear Before the March of Tour| publisher= absolutepunk.net| date= December 21, 2006| url= http://absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=477651| access-date= August 15, 2008}}</ref> Fear Before also announced on September 9, 2008 that they would be dropping "The March of Flames" from their name, and would from now on be known as simply "Fear Before". The band had considered keeping their full name and simply titling the album ''Fear Before'', but decided against it at the last minute.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chorus.fm/|title=chorus.fm|website=Chorus.fm|access-date=March 11, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://equalvision.com/news/show/312 |title=Archived copy |access-date=February 16, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210171125/http://equalvision.com/news/show/312 |archive-date=February 10, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://myspace.com/fearbefore|title=Fear Before &#124; Listen and Stream Free Music, Albums, New Releases, Photos, Videos|website=Myspace.com|access-date=March 11, 2020}}</ref>

In early 2009, Zach Hutchings left the band to join Utah group I Am the Ocean. Adam has stated that Zach left due to some personal and creative tensions, though Zach and the band remain good friends. The band decided to remain a four piece. After Binks' departure, the band supported [[Alesana]] on a package tour that spring. In the summer, Fear Before toured Australia for the first time, where their friend Trent Jacobi fell through the roof of a house and was hospitalized. In response to this event, Fear Before posted their discography on [[Bandcamp.com]] to raise money to cover hospital bills. Tour and labelmates [[Circa Survive]] also released a limited edition 7" featuring b-sides from ''[[On Letting Go]]'' to raise money for Trent.

After returning from Australia they embarked on what would be their last two headlining tours. The first was in the United States with [[Oceana (band)|Oceana]] and [[Memphis May Fire]] as support. The second, titled "The Hunt for Shred October", was across Canada with [[Baptized in Blood]], [[Trophy Scars]] and [[Black Moor (musical group)|Black Moor]] from August to September.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Julien|first=Alexandre|date=September 19, 2009|title=The Zyphoid Process & Great White North|url=http://www.abridgedpause.com/thezyphoidprocess-greatwhitenorth|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191229215625/http://www.abridgedpause.com/thezyphoidprocess-greatwhitenorth|archive-date=December 29, 2019|access-date=September 6, 2020|website=Abridged Pause Blog|language=en-US}}</ref> The band planned to not tour in 2010 and instead stay home and continue work on their fifth full-length. The band's last show before their hiatus began was on December 4, 2009 at the Crabtree Brewing Company in Greeley, Colorado.

===Possible fifth album and indefinite hiatus (2010-present)===
In January 2011, Adam played his first solo show at the Larimer Lounge in Denver, Colorado. He revealed that the songs he had been writing were not quite right for Fear Before, and later dubbed the project All Human. After playing several local shows in the Denver and Salt Lake areas, he released the first All Human demos online. A 14-track album tentatively titled ''Catholic Guilt and the Queerest of Thoughts'' was expected to be released later in the  year, and is notable for featuring original Fear Before drummer Brandon Proff on many of the tracks. After close to 18 months of silence from the band, Adam posted the following message on the band's Facebook, signaling an indefinite hiatus.

"guys. im sorry if you have been left with the feeling that we (fear before the march of flames) have been leading you on making you think were working on music. we are not. as of april 2010 goose david mike and i have not been in the same room together with our instruments. however, until april 2010 i had written quite a few songs for a new fear before the march of flames record with the help of goose. whether or not we will ever release another record is up in the air right now. there is no immediate plan to write/record/ or tour. this has nothing to do with Orbs, Loom, All Human, or any other project goose or i may be a part of. Its just the way things went. 2009 took a very weird turn for us and it kinda left all of us collectively and individually wondering what the hell we were doing. I truly am sorry to everyone who is anxiously awaiting a new record from us. im not saying it will never happen, i just cant say that it will. we appreciate all you as friends and fans have allowed us to do and the second there is any development in fear before world you will be the first to know. please feel free to voice your opinion on the matter and i will respond. just know i truly hate bumming any of you out. it truly wasn't my or our intent for it to come to this. as far as all human goes, that is where i will be directing my creative energy for the time being. i hope you guys will enjoy that for what it is. its not a side project or something to keep me busy until something else comes along. it is the music i feel like making and sharing for right now. love you guys. thank you for your support.  adam"

Three days later he made another statement making it clear the band was not breaking up, saying "friends. do not mistake my previous post for a break up announcement. it was an update letting you know that we are currently inactive and there is no forthcoming record from us as of now. i cannot say what the future holds.-adam"

As of October 20, 2014 the band had alluded on their Facebook to new upcoming material, saying "New songs... No hoax." The band has since updated their Facebook to reflect new material titled "Absolute Future Absolute Past".
