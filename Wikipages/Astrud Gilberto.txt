She sang on two tracks on the influential 1963 album ''[[Getz/Gilberto]]'' featuring João Gilberto, Stan Getz, and [[Antônio Carlos Jobim]], despite having never sung professionally before this recording. The 1964 single version of "[[The Girl from Ipanema]]", taken from the 1963 album, omitted the Portuguese lyrics sung by João Gilberto, and established Astrud Gilberto as a [[Bossa Nova]] singer. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

Her first solo album was ''[[The Astrud Gilberto Album]]'' (1965). Upon moving to the United States, she went on tour with Getz.<ref name="jazzsight"/> Beginning as a singer of bossa nova and American jazz standards, Gilberto started to record her own compositions in the 1970s. She has recorded songs in Portuguese, English, Spanish, Italian, French, German, and Japanese.

In 1982, Gilberto's son Marcelo joined her group, touring with her for more than a decade as bassist. In addition, he collaborated as co-producer of the albums ''Live in New York'' (1996) and ''Temperance'' (1997). Her son Gregory Lasorsa played guitar on the ''Temperance'' album on the song "Beautiful You", which features singer [[Michael Franks (musician)|Michael Franks]].

Gilberto received the Latin Jazz USA Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1992, and was inducted into the [[International Latin Music Hall of Fame]] in 2002. In 1996, she contributed to the AIDS benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Rio]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]], performing the song "[[Desafinado]]" (Portuguese for "slightly out of tune", or "off key") along with [[George Michael]]. Although she did not officially retire, Gilberto announced in 2002 that she was taking "indefinite time off" from public performances.

Her original recording of "[[Fly Me to the Moon]]" was edited as a duet using a recording of the same song by [[Frank Sinatra]] for the soundtrack of ''[[Down with Love]]'' (2003). Her recording "[[Who Can I Turn To?]]" was sampled by [[The Black Eyed Peas]] in the song "Like That" from the 2005 album ''[[Monkey Business (The Black Eyed Peas album)|Monkey Business]]''. Her vocals on "Berimbau" were sampled by [[Cut Chemist]] in his song "The Garden". Her recording of "[[Once I Loved]]" was featured in the 2007 film ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]''.
The "Astrud" track on [[Basia Trzetrzelewska]]'s 1987 album, ''[[Time and Tide (Basia album)|Time and Tide]]'', is a tribute to Gilberto.
