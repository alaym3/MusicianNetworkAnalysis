==Life and career==
Ryan was born on May 21, 1949 and grew up in Cleveland, Ohio.<ref name="deadline.com"/><ref name="Hischak">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e1RTP8thtR0C&pg=PA3|title=Disney Voice Actors: A Biographical Dictionary|last=Hischak|first=Thomas S.|date=2011-09-15|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786486946|language=en}}</ref> He became established by singing about the American West. In summer 1966, Ryan's earlier band, Wead, played a gig in Wellington, Ohio.

In late 1970s, he teamed up with [[Phil Baron]] as Willio and Phillio.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_7190/is_/ai_n29867469 Cleveland Jewish News]{{dead link|date=November 2016}}</ref> They had regular gigs on television, radio and comedy clubs and universities throughout the U.S.. They later paired up again voicing characters of best friends Teddy Ruxpin (Baron) and Grubby the Octopede (Ryan) in the [[Teddy Ruxpin]] book and tape series as well as the 1986–87 television show ''[[The Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin]]''. In August 2002, Willio and Phillio returned to Cleveland for two performances at historic Cain Park and another at the famed Beachland Ballroom. At the Cain Park show, friend Alec Nordstrom of Hudson was invited onstage. Cleveland's revered rock critic and "world's oldest teenager," Jane Scott, attended and reviewed the Beachland performance for the Cleveland Plain Dealer. The Willio and Phillio act brought Ryan back into music and after moving to [[California]], he began to write and record songs for [[The Walt Disney Company]].

Willio and Phillio performed "I Wish it Could Be Christmas All Year Long" on a Disney Christmas album in a voice similar to [[Micky Dolenz]] of [[The Monkees]].

He provided the voices of [[Rabbit (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Rabbit]] and [[Tigger]], and the singing voice of [[Eeyore]], in the [[Disney Channel]]'s long-running series ''[[Welcome to Pooh Corner]]'' and in many other Pooh cartoons. He also provided the voice of Barnaby the Dog on the popular series ''[[Dumbo's Circus]]''.

In 1987, Ryan became a fixture of the radio drama ''[[Adventures in Odyssey]]'', as Eugene Meltsner, Harlow Doyle, David Harley, Patrick O'Ryan and over 100 individual characters. He voiced Rabbit in ''[[Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore]]'', Digit in ''[[An American Tail]]'', Petrie in ''[[The Land Before Time (film)|The Land Before Time]]'', and [[Willie the Giant]] in ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]''. He continued to do voice work. In 2009, he was working on the third season of ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'', the 21st season of ''Adventures in Odyssey'', and the new radio series of Will Ryan's Cactus County Round-Up which featured his band The Cactus County Cowboys. In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Road to the North Pole]]", he provided the voice for [[Winnie-the-Pooh]]. As a side project, with [[Andrew J. Lederer]] and Michael Rosenberg (Jackie Diamond), Will Ryan briefly performed in the '20s-style music and comedy trio The Merry Metronomes. He and Lederer also appeared from time to time as a duo, usually under the name The Natty Nabobs. He and Nick Santa Maria also performed occasionally as a vaudeville-era comedy team, Biffle & Shooster (Ryan played the latter); and in 2013 they made their first film, a faux 1930s comedy short titled ''It's a Frame-Up!''. 

Beginning on January 28th 2021, until his death Will was the co-host of the "Tell Ya Later" show on YouTube with longtime friend and co-star [[Katie Leigh]]. The final episode featuring Ryan premiered on November 15 2021, 4 days before his death.<ref name="TellYaLater">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQ1grYbehF8 |title=The Bermuda Triangle of Thought! - Tell Ya Later|author= |date=January 28, 2021 |website=youtube.com |access-date=November 22, 2021}}</ref>
