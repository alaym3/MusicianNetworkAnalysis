White Fence is the oldest gang in Los Angeles.

The gang's name has also been interpreted as a "[[Philosophical logic|symbolic]] barrier" between the white residents in the area and the [[Hispanic]] residents of the neighborhood, at a time when racism plagued the area. During the 1950s and 1960s, White Fence was considered one of the "most violent and powerful gangs in East Los Angeles."<ref>{{cite book |last=Rosen |first=Fred |date=2005 |title=Historical Analysis of American Crime |url=https://archive.org/details/historicalatlaso0000rose |url-access=registration |pages=[https://archive.org/details/historicalatlaso0000rose/page/235 235–237] |location=New York, NY |publisher=Facts on File Inc. }}</ref><ref name="BC" /> The rivalry between the gang and another Hispanic gang, El Hoyo Maravilla, is one of the longest, ongoing feuds in all of Los Angeles, a rivalry going back to the 1930s.<ref name="BC"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Vinson |first1= J. |last2= Crame |first2=J. |last3=Von Seeburg |first3= K. |title=Rocky Mountain Information Network, (2008).
