'''Otis Rush Jr.''' (April 29, 1934 – September 29, 2018)<ref name=death/> was an American [[blues]] guitarist and singer-songwriter. His distinctive guitar style featured a slow-burning sound and long [[note bending|bent notes]]. With qualities similar to the styles of other 1950s artists [[Magic Sam]] and [[Buddy Guy]], his sound became known as [[Chicago Blues#Cobra Records|West Side Chicago blues]] and was an influence on many musicians, including [[Mike Bloomfield|Michael Bloomfield]], [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]] and [[Eric Clapton]].

Rush was left-handed and played as such; however, his guitars were strung with the low E string at the bottom, upside-down from typical guitarists.<ref name="Msblues"/>  He often played with the little finger of his pick hand curled under the low E for positioning. It is widely believed that this contributed to his distinctive sound. He had a wide-ranging, powerful [[tenor|tenor voice]].<ref name="AMG">{{cite web|author=Dahl, Bill |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/otis-rush-mn0000894956/biography |title=Otis Rush: Biography |publisher=[[AllMusic]].com |date=April 29, 1934 |access-date=May 21, 2015}}</ref>
