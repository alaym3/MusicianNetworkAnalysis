==History==
===Early life and origins of Miracle of Sound===
Dunne is the son of late Irish poet [[Sean Dunne (poet)|Seán Dunne]] and is from [[Cork (Ireland)|Cork]], Ireland.<ref name="thejournal" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://twitter.com/miracleofsound/status/596797249201516544 |title=Twitter comment by Gavin Dunne |date=8 May 2015 |website=Twitter |access-date=5 January 2017 |archive-date=30 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210830154734/https://twitter.com/miracleofsound/status/596797249201516544 |url-status=live }}</ref> Before starting Miracle of Sound, Dunne spent 15 years playing in various groups.<ref name="Russian Interview">{{cite web | url=http://old.mirf.ru/Articles/art5938.htm&usg=ALkJrhiXB0PU-i667AWlX07F4W-EZ0APvQ | title=Музыкальный центр | work=Issue 123 | publisher=[[Mir Fantastiki]] (Fantasy World Magazine) | date=1 November 2013 | access-date=18 October 2016 | archive-date=18 October 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018203309/http://old.mirf.ru/Articles/art5938.htm%26usg%3DALkJrhiXB0PU-i667AWlX07F4W-EZ0APvQ | url-status=live }}</ref>

As part of his previous band, ''Lotus Lullaby'', he and his bandmates competed in and won the Bank of Ireland National Student Music Awards in 2006,<ref name="Lotus Lulluby 1">{{cite web | url=http://www.hotpress.com/archive/2852903.html | title=Bank of Ireland National Student Music Awards' acts revealed | publisher=The Hot Press | date=2 March 2006 | access-date=23 October 2016 | archive-date=22 October 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022224659/http://www.hotpress.com/archive/2852903.html | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Lotus Lullaby 2">{{cite web | url=http://www.hotpress.com/National-Student-Music-Awards/music/reviews/live/Bank-Of-Ireland-National-Student-Music-Awards-live-at-TBMC-Dublin/2861588.html | title=Bank of Ireland National Student Music Awards live at TBMC, Dublin | publisher=The Hot Press | date=21 April 2006 | access-date=23 October 2016 | author=Cummins, Steve | archive-date=19 May 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519143838/http://www.hotpress.com/National-Student-Music-Awards/music/reviews/live/Bank-Of-Ireland-National-Student-Music-Awards-live-at-TBMC-Dublin/2861588.html | url-status=live }}</ref> as well as the Murphy's Battle of the Bands earlier the same year.<ref name="murphys">{{cite web | url=http://www.donal.ie/2006/04/04/murphys-battle-of-the-bands-final-2006/ | title=Murphy's Battle of the Bands Final 2006 | date=4 April 2006 | access-date=23 October 2016 | archive-date=23 October 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023210701/http://www.donal.ie/2006/04/04/murphys-battle-of-the-bands-final-2006/ | url-status=live }}</ref>

After the break-up of ''Lotus Lullaby'', Dunne became inspired by the video games he was playing and wrote several songs based on his favourite games, intended on conveying the atmosphere of the game or the mood of the characters.<ref name="Russian Interview" /><ref name="Interview with gavin" /> He began with the song "Gordon Freeman Saved My Life",<ref name="Interview with gavin" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMUyjvXpMV0 |title=Gordon Freeman Saved My Life!

The song amassed 15,000 views in one night on YouTube, something Dunne had struggled to do for years.<ref name="Interview with gavin" /> He continued with "The Ballad of Clay Carmine", which had another positive reception, and Dunne realised that he had found a significant niche audience and he continued to write songs based on video games.<ref name="examiner"/><ref name="Russian Interview"/><ref name="Interview with gavin" />

One of these early songs, "Commander Shepard", based on the [[Commander Shepard|character]] from the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' series of the same name, went [[viral video|viral]] and eventually amassed millions of views, leading to a rapid rise in popularity for the musician.<ref name="examiner"/><ref name="Interview with gavin" /><ref name="Escapist-BioWare"/>

===Coordination with game developers===
Following his success with "Commander Shepard", Dunne eventually met with the marketing team from [[BioWare]], the creative team behind the ''Mass Effect'' series, while he was at [[gamescom]] in Germany in August 2011.<ref name="Interview with gavin">{{cite web | url=http://nightmaremode.thegamerstrust.com/2011/09/03/interview-with-gavin-dunne-of-miracle-of-sound/ | title=Interview with Gavin Dunne of Miracle of Sound | publisher=The gamer trust | date=3 September 2011 | access-date=23 October 2016 | author=Hedges, Jordan | archive-date=9 October 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009184703/http://nightmaremode.thegamerstrust.com/2011/09/03/interview-with-gavin-dunne-of-miracle-of-sound/ | url-status=live }}</ref> There he released another ''Mass Effect'' song, "Normandy", based on the ending of ''[[Mass Effect 2]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/112180-Miracle-of-Sound-to-Premere-Mass-Effect-Song-Live-with-BioWare |title=Miracle of Sound to Premere &#91;sic&#93; Mass Effect Song Live with BioWare |last=Tito |first=Greg |date=11 August 2011 |publisher=The Escapist |access-date=23 October 2016 |archive-date=24 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024024020/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/112180-Miracle-of-Sound-to-Premere-Mass-Effect-Song-Live-with-BioWare |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Escapist-BioWare">{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/112458-Miracle-of-Sound-Talks-to-BioWare |title=Miracle of Sound Talks to BioWare |last=Westbrook |first=Logan |date=2 March 2015 |publisher=The Escapist |access-date=19 September 2016 |archive-date=30 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130204421/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/112458-Miracle-of-Sound-Talks-to-BioWare |url-status=live }}</ref> Coordinating with BioWare, Dunne became involved in the marketing campaign for the next game in the series, ''[[Mass Effect 3]]''.

Some of his songs have also been used within videogames. His song based on the indie [[CRPG]] ''[[Wasteland 2]]'', titled "Cries of a Dead World" was included in the game itself, being used for the end credits.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/137499-Wasteland-2-Includes-Music-From-Gavin-Dunne-of-Miracle-of-Sound |title=Wasteland 2 Features Music From Miracle of Sound |last=Hoffman |first=Mike |date=19 September 2014 |publisher=The Escapist |access-date=19 September 2016 |archive-date=6 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006143030/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/137499-Wasteland-2-Includes-Music-From-Gavin-Dunne-of-Miracle-of-Sound |url-status=live }}</ref> One of Miracle of Sound's earliest songs, "Gordon Freeman Saved My Life", was later included as a playable song in the game ''[[Rock Band (video game)|Rock Band]]''.<ref name="rock band">{{cite web | url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/115254-Play-Miracle-of-Sound-in-Rock-Band | title=Play Miracle of Sound in Rock Band | publisher=The Escapist | date=17 January 2012 | access-date=23 October 2016 | author=Tito, Greg | archive-date=24 October 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024022511/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/115254-Play-Miracle-of-Sound-in-Rock-Band | url-status=live }}</ref> His song "Keepers", in collaboration with [[Marcin Przybyłowicz]], was written for the game ''[[Seven: The Days Long Gone]]'' and is the official theme song of the [[CRPG|isometric RPG]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://nerdist.com/miracle-of-sound-debuts-theme-seven-the-days-long-gone/ |title=Miracle of Sound debuts the theme from Seven: The Days Long Gone |last=Marnell |first=Blair |location=Nerdist |date=23 April 2017 |access-date=9 May 2017 |archive-date=16 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170616191422/http://nerdist.com/miracle-of-sound-debuts-theme-seven-the-days-long-gone/ |url-status=live }}</ref> and was used in the game's trailer.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cogconnected.com/2017/04/seven-trailer-features-miracle-sound/ |title=New Seven: The Days Long Gone trailer features Miracle of Sound |location=COG news |date=20 April 2017 |access-date=9 May 2017 |archive-date=24 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424034903/http://cogconnected.com/2017/04/seven-trailer-features-miracle-sound/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Music and reception by critics===
In traditional video game style, his albums are named in increasing levels – ''Level 1'', ''Level 2'' and so on. However, he has also released two other non-gaming-related albums. His [[instrumental]] album called ''Vistas'' had a mixed reception, receiving 3.5 out of 5 stars from Nick Mongiardo of ''Sputnik Music'' who said "''Vistas'' has some issues with pacing and contains some jarring shifts in style, but anyone who enjoys chilled out instrumental music will love this."<ref name="Vistas">{{cite web | url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/60913/Miracle-of-Sound-Vistas/ | title=Miracle of Sound Vistas | publisher=Sputnik Music | date=10 February 2014 | access-date=18 October 2016 | author=Mongiardo, Nick | archive-date=30 August 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210830154631/https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/60913/Miracle-of-Sound-Vistas/ | url-status=live }}</ref> His seventh album, ''[[Metal Up]]'', a [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] compilation with some songs based on Irish folklore, topped the iTunes Metal chart for 2 days following its release in early 2015.<ref name="Metal up for everyone">{{Cite web |url=http://www.sbindependent.org/metal-up-metal-for-everyone/ |title=Metal Up: Metal For Everyone! |last=Matyi |first=Kevin |date=7 April 2015 |publisher=Stony Brook Independent |access-date=19 September 2016 |archive-date=18 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018230824/https://sbindependent.org/metal-up-metal-for-everyone/ |url-status=live }}</ref> ''Metal Up'' was described as mix of classic rock, hard rock, and metal, and was praised by ''Firstherd'' for its Celtic influences in some songs which were "very original when placed in a metal framework".<ref name="Metal up review firstherd">{{Cite web |url=https://firstherd.wordpress.com/2015/04/21/first-listen-review-miracle-of-sound-metal-up/ |title=First Listen Review: Miracle of Sound – "Metal Up" |last=Firstherd |date=21 April 2015 |publisher=Firstherd |access-date=18 October 2016 |archive-date=19 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019100631/https://firstherd.wordpress.com/2015/04/21/first-listen-review-miracle-of-sound-metal-up/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The album was also given a 5 out of 5 score by ''Rock Review''.<ref name="Rock review metal up">{{Cite web |url=http://rock-review.ru/reviews/18184-retsenziya-na-albom-miracle-of-sound-metal-up.html |title=Рецензия на альбом Miracle of Sound – Metal Up |last=Доктор Форкосиган |date=25 May 2015 |publisher=Rock Review |access-date=20 October 2016 |archive-date=15 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161015171807/http://rock-review.ru/reviews/18184-retsenziya-na-albom-miracle-of-sound-metal-up.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Shortly before the [[Wasteland 2#Director.27s Cut|''Wasteland 2 Director's Cut'']] re-release in 2015, Dunne released a [[musical parody|parody]] of the ''[[Dire Straits]]'' song "[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]", titled "I want my RPG". The lyrics of the song criticise modern [[free to play]] games, [[Micropayment#Online gaming|microtransactions]] and [[downloadable content]] and express the desire for more games of the old [[Role-playing video game#Tactical RPGs|CRPG]] style.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://nichegamer.com/2015/06/big-wasteland-2-kickstarter-update-talks-names-changes-music-and-perks |title=Big Wasteland 2 Kickstarter Update Talks Names Changes, Music, And Perks |last=Batchelor |first=Carl |date=23 June 2015 |publisher=Niche Gamer |access-date=19 September 2016 |archive-date=2 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202234356/http://nichegamer.com/2015/06/big-wasteland-2-kickstarter-update-talks-names-changes-music-and-perks/ |url-status=live }}</ref> He did not include the song on any album, saying on ''Twitter'' that "It's a parody of someone else's song.

Many of his songs have received very positive reviews, such as his [[doo-wop]] song "Going Nuclear", based on the then-upcoming game ''[[Fallout 4]]'', which drew praise from video game journalists for matching the tone and style of the game's aesthetic very well.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/fallout-4-fan-song-going-nuclear/ |title=Fallout 4 Fan Song Going Nuclear |last=Prell |first=Sam |date=25 August 2015 |publisher=Gamesradar |access-date=19 September 2016 |archive-date=6 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306084643/http://www.gamesradar.com/fallout-4-fan-song-going-nuclear/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://gamerant.com/fallout-4-song-going-nuclear-918/ |title=Fallout 4 Song Going Nuclear |last=Sledge |first=Kyle |date=August 2015 |publisher=Gamerant |access-date=19 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006151753/https://gamerant.com/fallout-4-song-going-nuclear-918/ |archive-date=6 October 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> His song "The Lucky Ones" was considered unique by being written from the point of view of the background characters, rather than the player characters of ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://nerdist.com/miracle-of-sounds-the-division-inspired-song-finds-the-lucky-ones/ |title=Miracle of Sound's The Division inspired song finds 'The Lucky Ones. |last=Marnell |first=Blair |date=April 2016 |publisher=Nerdist |access-date=19 September 2016 |archive-date=6 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006125205/http://nerdist.com/miracle-of-sounds-the-division-inspired-song-finds-the-lucky-ones/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.movienewsguide.com/division-latest-update-patches-original-game-inspired-song-released/191188 |title='The Division': Latest update patches, original game-inspired song released! |last=Cuenca |first=Enrico |date=April 2016 |publisher=Movie News Guide |access-date=19 September 2016 |archive-date=17 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917121100/http://www.movienewsguide.com/division-latest-update-patches-original-game-inspired-song-released/191188 |url-status=live }}</ref> He has written two songs about the ''[[Uncharted]]'' franchise "Keep Drifting" and "Here we go Again", inspired by the main character's sense of adventure and being a drifter at heart.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://nerdist.com/miracle-of-sound-releases-uncharted-4-inspired-song/ |title=Miracle of Sound releases an Uncharted 4 inspired song |last=Marnell |first=Blair |date=May 2016 |publisher=Nerdist |access-date=19 September 2016 |quote=When asked about his inspiration for this song, Dunne told us that it was "mainly the sense of adventure.

In late 2016, he released "Pawns of War", a [[Battlefield 1]] inspired song where Dunne's goal was to fuse the feel of the game's soundtrack with [[Martial music#Marching songs|old military marching tunes]], creating a composition that focuses on soldiers doomed to be forgotten after being thrown into the "meat grinder" of [[WWI]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://nerdist.com/miracle-of-sounds-battlefield-1-inspired-song-plays-for-the-pawns-of-war/ |title=Miracle of Sound's Battlefield 1 inspired song plays for the "Pawns of War" |last=Marnell |first=Blair |location=Nerdist |date=7 November 2016 |access-date=23 March 2017 |archive-date=23 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323142957/http://nerdist.com/miracle-of-sounds-battlefield-1-inspired-song-plays-for-the-pawns-of-war/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Collaborative works===
Dunne generally works alone, performing or electronically creating all of the instrument tracks for his music and layering the result to create a single track.<ref name="Interview with gavin" /> He provides most of the vocals for his songs himself, plays guitar, bass and keyboard, and can use electronic programs for drums and many other instruments, including orchestral pieces. However, he has collaborated with other artists at times for vocals or other instruments that he cannot play or create electronically.<ref name="Interview with gavin" />

He has worked with several guest vocalists; with [[Malukah]] on the song "Legends of the Frost",<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FLQ4rACE-0 |title=Skyrim Song – Legends of the Frost by Miracle of Sound ft.

From November 2014 to September 2019, Dunne joined video game critic [[Jim Sterling]] and gaming journalist Laura Kate Dale (Laura K Buzz on social media) on a weekly podcast, the ''Podquisition'', which primarily discussed video game and pop culture related news.

In late 2013, multiple [[YouTube copyright strike|copyright strikes]] were issued by YouTube against Dunne's videos for use of his own music, as well as against other users who had used his music in their videos with permission. All of the strikes were initiated by INDMUSIC, on behalf of [[TuneCore]], the company that distributed Miracle of Sound's songs at the time. Though the incident was resolved successfully, Dunne commented that although TuneCore was trying to help artists, their efforts did more damage than good and that he depends on [[let's plays]] and gaming videos to spread and popularise his music by word of mouth.<ref name="copyright strikes">{{Cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/130667-YouTube-Issued-Copyright-Claims-Against-Miracle-of-Sound |title=YouTube Issued Copyright Claims Against Miracle of Sound |last=Lemon, Marshall |date=19 December 2013 |publisher=The Escapist |access-date=23 October 2016 |quote="I think TuneCore has the artist's best interests at heart but their methods need massive changes," Dunne said.
