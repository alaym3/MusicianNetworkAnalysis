Page 73. Santigold: "I keep a Rolodex of the women that vocally inspire me. There aren't that many, but she's definitely one of them. I remember one of the first times I heard "Red Light" it was at a party, and I remember going up to the DJ and being like, "Who's this?". It was that good. I kind of stopped and was like... wow. There's not a tremendous amount of women who are bold and forward thinking as artists. I feel like her music, at the time especially, was pretty unique in the way that it sort of matched her style. The freedom of experimenting with this dark place that doesn't have a place often in modern music."</ref> The singer has also stated that she is inspired by 1980s [[pop music]], feeling that it "had a depth to it", and that she hopes to "bring back some more good pop songs."<ref name="drownedinsound"/> The singer's main influences are [[James Brown]] and [[Aretha Franklin]]<ref name=Birm>{{cite web | url = http://www.birminghammail.net/what-is-on-in-birmingham/rock-and-pop/2008/05/23/santi-achieves-gold-standard-97319-20965915/ | title = Santi achieves gold standard | work = [[Birmingham Mail]] | date = May 23, 2008 | access-date = May 26, 2008 }}</ref> and she has cited [[Devo]] as her "ultimate favorite band."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insidevandy.com/drupal/node/8832 |title=Q&A with Santogold The Vanderbilt Hustler November&nbsp;17, 2008 |website=Insidevandy.com |date=November 17, 2008 |access-date=April 18, 2011}}</ref> White also grew up listening to a lot of [[reggae music|reggae]], [[jazz music|jazz]], [[Fela Kuti]] and [[Nigerian music]].<ref name=Birm/>
