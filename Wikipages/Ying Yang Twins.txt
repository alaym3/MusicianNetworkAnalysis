The '''Ying Yang Twins''' are an American hip hop duo consisting of '''Kaine''' (born '''Eric Jackson''' on December 16, 1978, age {{age|1978|12|16}}) and '''D-Roc''' (born '''Deongelo Holmes''' on February 23, 1979, age {{age|1979|2|23}}). They are not actually twin brothers. The group debuted in 2000 and rose to mainstream popularity in 2003 collaborating with [[Britney Spears]] on her album ''[[In the Zone]]'' and with [[Lil Jon]] on "[[Get Low (Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz song)|Get Low]]". In 2004 and 2005, Ying Yang Twins became more popular with party singles "[[Salt Shaker (song)|Salt Shaker]]", "[[Wait (The Whisper Song)]]", "[[Shake (Ying Yang Twins song)|Shake]]" and "[[Badd]]". They have received notoriety for their song "Halftime (featuring Homebwoi)" which is played at [[New Orleans Saints]] homegames after most touchdowns. In 2008, the hip hop duo released ''The Official Work'' mixtape. In 2009, they followed with their ''Ying Yang Forever'' mixtape. Just three months later, the duo released ''Legendary Status: Ying Yang Twins Greatest Hits''. In 2013, the Ying Yang Twins released the ''Ass in Session'' and ''Twurk or Die'' mixtapes.

==Career==
Their single "Whistle While You Twurk" was played on urban and pop radio stations and peaked at #17 on the [[R&B/Hip-Hop Tracks chart|US R&B/Hip-Hop]] chart. They grew even more famous when they toured with Juz tha King, Kat Nu and Demo Dil on a tour called King Me. Their full-length debut album ''[[Thug Walkin]]''' was released that year.

Immediately after discovering fellow Atlanta hip hop artist [[Lil Jon]], [[A&R]] Bryan Leach began talks with representative [[Mr. Collipark]] about signing them to [[TVT Records]]. Protracted negotiations meant that a deal was not finalized in time for the label to release their next album ''[[Alley: The Return of the Ying Yang Twins]]'', which instead appeared in 2002 on Koch.<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_BryanLeachInt.html|title= Interview with Bryan Leach|publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=5 Apr 2004|access-date=28 Jan 2011}}</ref> The album was successful among hip-hop fans in the [[Southern United States]]. The same year, the group appeared on the album ''[[Kings of Crunk]]'' by [[Lil Jon]] on the single "[[Get Low (Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz song)|Get Low]]", and the song was a huge club and radio hit. As Crooms had negotiated only a one-album deal with Koch, the duo was free to finally submit to the advances of TVT, who had impressed them with their recent work with Lil Jon & The East Side Boyz.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/><ref name="amg">{{cite web|last=Phares|first=Heather|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p392373|pure_url=yes}}|title=Ying Yang Twins > Biography|publisher=Allmusic|year=2006}}</ref>

Their first album for TVT, ''[[Me & My Brother]]'', was [[RIAA certification|certified platinum]] on April 12, 2005,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Ying%20Yang%20Twins&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=on&before=on&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2008&sort=CertificationDate&perPage=50 |title=Gold & Platinum Searchable Database - December 12, 2012 |publisher=RIAA |access-date=2012-12-12}}</ref> and yielded three more hits — "Whats Happnin!", "Naggin'" and the popular Lil Jon collaboration "Salt Shaker".<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r654025|pure_url=yes}} "Me & My Brother" singles on Allmusic.com]</ref> The same year the duo appeared on [[Britney Spears]]' album ''[[In the Zone (album)|In the Zone]]'' singing the song "I Got That (Boom Boom)" and her television special of the same name.<ref name="amg"/> In 2004, TVT released ''[[My Brother & Me]]'', an album composed largely of remixes which featured a bonus [[DVD]] of the group's videos.<ref>Jeffries, David. [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r713694|pure_url=yes}} "My Brother & Me" overview]. [[Allmusic]]: 2004</ref>

A new album ''[[U.S.A. (United State of Atlanta)]]'' appeared in the summer of 2005 as its singles  "[[Wait (The Whisper Song)]]", "[[Badd]]", and "[[Shake (Ying Yang Twins song)|Shake]]" were dominating popular music and rap radio stations,<ref name="amg"/> and ''[[U.S.A. (Still United)]]'', a collection of [[outtake]]s, remixes, and [[collaboration]]s similar to ''[[My Brother & Me]]'' followed in December 2005. It too was accompanied by a DVD featuring music videos and other footage from the ''[[U.S.A. (United State of Atlanta)]]'' period.<ref>Jeffries, David. [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r813257|pure_url=yes}} "USA Still United" - overview]. [[Allmusic]]: 2005</ref>

In 2005, D-Roc and his younger brothers, Mr. Ball, and Da Birthday Boy, formed the group Da Muzicianz and released their first single, ''"Camera Phone"''. Their self-titled album was released on February 28, 2006.

The group's fifth album ''[[Chemically Imbalanced (Ying Yang Twins album)|Chemically Imbalanced]]'' was released in November 2006.  For this album the Twins collaborated with producers [[Wyclef Jean]] and Keith Duplessis in addition to [[Mr. Collipark]], who produced a majority of the songs on the group's previous album.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r932621|pure_url=yes}} "Chemically Imbalanced" credits]</ref> The first two singles were the [[Hall & Oates]]-sampling "[[Dangerous (Ying Yang Twins song)|Dangerous]]", featuring [[Wyclef Jean]],<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r932621|pure_url=yes}} "Chemically Imbalanced" singles]</ref> and "Jigglin'".<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p392373|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic ((( Ying Yang Twins > Discography > Singles & EPs )))]</ref> In 2008, the Twins released the mixtape ''[[The Official Work]]'' and a promo single titled "Drop". A highlight of the Ying Yang Twins' tour includes a visit to the Epsilon Mu chapter of [[Sigma Chi]]. Here they performed all their hits live in front of a sold out Texas crowd. All of the proceeds from the show went to charity. In 2009, the Twins released their latest album with Deep Records, ''[[Ying Yang Forever]]'', and started a tour titled "Ying Yang Forever Tour".

Their song "Halftime (Stand Up and Get Crunk)" is now a standard in many [[NFL]] football stadiums, and is considered to be the unofficial anthem of the New Orleans Saints during their Super Bowl victory season, even though it has been a staple at Saints games since 2006.  This song was performed live during the victory parade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2010/02/downtown_new_orleans_a_sea_of.html|title=Downtown New Orleans a sea of traffic as New Orleans Saints parade rolls - New Orleans Saints Football NFL News|publisher=NOLA.com|access-date=2012-03-27}}</ref> The song has also been used in ''[[NFL Street 2]]'' and ''[[Madden NFL 11]]'' as well as the Opening Tip at home games for the [[NBA]]'s [[San Antonio Spurs]] throughout the majority of the 2000s.

On November 3, 2009, Ying Yang Twins released their [[greatest hits]] album via The Orchard and BOOTY Records.  The album includes top ten ''Billboard'' hits "What's Happinin", "Shake", "Salt Shaker", and “Wait (The Whisper Song)” plus three new tracks.<ref>{{cite web|last=Canada|first=Danielle|title=Ying Yang Twins Release Greatest Hits Album|url=http://hiphopwired.com/2009/11/06/ying-yang-twins-release-greatest-hits-album/|publisher=Hip Hop Wired}}</ref>
