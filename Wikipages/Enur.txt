==As Enur==
In 2007, Rune and Torpe, under the name Enur, scored a major club hit in 2007 with a new version of "[[Calabria (song)|Calabria]]" titled "[[Calabria (song)#"Calabria 2007" (as Enur)|Calabria 2007]]" featuring reggae vocalist and fellow Dane [[Natasja Saad]]. "Calabria 2007" peaked at No. 9 in France,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lescharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Enur+feat.+Natasja&titel=Calabria+2007&cat=s|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012161720/http://lescharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Enur+feat.+Natasja&titel=Calabria+2007&cat=s|url-status=dead|title=lescharts.com - Enur feat. Natasja - Calabria 2007|archivedate=October 12, 2012|website=lescharts.com}}</ref> as well becoming a hit in Belgium, Canada and Portugal. It crossed to American shores via New York dance label [[Ultra Records]] and charted on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, gaining support from mainstream and rhythmic top 40, dance and Latin radio. It also went to No. 29 on the European Hot 100 singles chart. The song was eventually remixed again for their album, ''[[Raggatronic]]'' in 2008. The song also appeared in a commercial for [[Target Corporation|Target]].<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUl6pzQBtI</ref>

Enur released ''[[Raggatronic]]'' on September 9, 2008, featuring guest artists such as [[Nicki Minaj]], [[Beenie Man]], [[Natasja Saad]], [[Nice & Smooth|Greg Nice]], [[Majid (rapper)|Majid]], Natalie Storm and [[Chopper City Boyz]]. According to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', the Caribbean, soul and electronic influences featured in "Calabria" are prominently featured on the album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1046883/enur|title=Enur|date=January 7, 2008|website=Billboard}}</ref>

While discussing ''Raggatronic'', Rune said: "I think America needs something fresh like that, and then also a lot of people – just the sound is such a mixture of influences. I think it appeals to a lot of different characters, and I think that's an advantage of coming from Europe and not having to pigeonhole into some sort of genre."<ref>http://dancemusic.about.com/od/remixersproducers/a/EnurInterview.htm</ref>
