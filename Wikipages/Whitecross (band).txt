'''Whitecross''' is an American [[Christian metal]] band from [[Illinois]], formed in 1985 by singer Scott Wenzel and guitarist [[Rex Carroll]], and re-formed in 2000. The band won three [[Dove Award]]s in the 1990s.

==History==
[[File:Whitecross-EoR2013-01.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|Scott Wenzel on stage in 2013]]
Whitecross formed in 1985 in [[Waukegan, Illinois]], releasing their first recording in 1987. Their early albums, which often invite comparisons to [[Ratt]], are laced with fast, technical [[electric guitar|guitar]] work. In 1994, Rex Carroll split with lead vocalist Scott Wenzel. Wenzel retained the use of the name "Whitecross" while Carroll went on to form King James with Jimi Bennett (see below). At this point the band's sound underwent a drastic change.

Whitecross has won three [[Dove Award]]s with ''Triumphant Return'' (in 1990) and ''In the Kingdom'' (in 1992) winning "Metal Album of the Year"<ref name="DOVE_HM">{{cite web |url=http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?cid=31 |title=Dove Award Recipients for Hard Music Album |accessdate=March 12, 2007 |publisher=[[Gospel Music Association]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020022738/http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?cid=31 |archivedate=October 20, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and ''Come unto the Light'' from the ''Unveiled'' album winning "Hard Music Recorded Song of the Year" at the [[25th GMA Dove Awards]] in 1994.<ref name="DOVE_95">{{cite web |url=http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1995 |title=Dove Award Recipients for 1995 |accessdate=March 12, 2007 |publisher=[[Gospel Music Association]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311040429/http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1995 |archivedate=March 11, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1994 prior to work starting on the ''Unveiled'' album, guitarist Rex Carroll left to form the band [[King James (band)|King James]] and pursue other musical ventures. In 1998, singer Scott Wenzel took a two-year break to do [[missionary|mission]] work in Paraguay, [[South America]]. During this time, Whitecross went on hiatus before re-emerging at Cornerstone Festival in 2000 when Carroll and Wenzel re-formed the band with Carroll, Wenzel, Michael Feighan and newcomer [[Benny Ramos]] providing bass, keyboards and vocals. Finally having achieved a long-sought lineup stability, the band started performing on a regular basis.

In 2005, the band went back into the studio to record ''Nineteen Eighty Seven'', which featured re-recordings of nine of the ten songs from the band's self-titled debut album (''You're Mine'' being the exclusion), as well as a re-recording of the song ''Love on the Line'' (previously unavailable on CD) and a new guitar instrumental by Rex Carroll.

On April 5, 2008, they played at the [[Legends of Rock]] festival in [[Ennepetal]], Germany. Beginning in July 2008, they played the first of several short tours in Guatemala featuring shows in [[Guatemala City]], [[Panajachel]], [[Huehuetenango]] and other cities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In 2017, Carroll and Feighan joined with David Bach and [[Jamie Rowe]] of [[Guardian (band)|Guardian]] to record ''Revival'', a new compilation of Whitecross and Guardian tracks and went on a short tour to promote the project. <ref>{{cite web|title=Guardian + Whitecross - About |url= https://guardianwhitecross.com/about |website=Guardianwhitecross.com |accessdate=January 10, 2018}}</ref>
