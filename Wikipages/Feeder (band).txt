'''Feeder''' are a Welsh [[Rock music|rock]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Talk Tonight Podcast's Instagram photo: "Episode 7 of the Talk Tonight Podcast is out now with @grantnicholas of @feederofficial üéß‚Å£ ‚Å£Listen now on link in bio on your preferred‚Ä¶" |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/CBfIwmnjh4V/ |access-date=16 June 2020 |website=Instagram}}</ref> band formed in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] in 1994. They have released 10 studio albums, 12 compilations, four EPs and 40 singles, spending a combined total of 183 weeks on the singles and albums charts as of 2019, while accumulating 25 top 75 singles between 1997 and 2012. At their peak of commercial success, Feeder won two [[Kerrang! Awards]] in 2001 and 2003; they were inducted into their Hall of Fame in August 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/kerrangradio/videos/2072992993008152/ |title=Feeder join the Kerrang! Radio Hall of Fame |work=Kerrang! Radio |access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref>

Feeder are one of the [[Britpop]] era bands to have continued success long after their peak. Their 2019 album ''[[Tallulah (Feeder album)|Tallulah]]'' debuted at number four, more than two decades after the group formed, and 20 years after their first top 10 album ''[[Yesterday Went Too Soon]]''.

The band was formed in 1994,<ref name="tjs">Jon Lee tribute night at [[T. J.'s]] Newport, programme guide.</ref> although an earlier incarnation under the name of "Reel" was formed in 1992 by vocalist and guitarist [[Grant Nicholas]], drummer [[Jon Lee (drummer)|Jon Lee]] and bassist Simon Blight, three of the four members of [[Raindancer]], after the departure of that band's other member, guitarist John Canham. However, Blight left Reel later in 1992, and the band played with many session bassists before hiring [[Taka Hirose]] in 1994 and re-establishing themselves as Feeder;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nickbrownonline.co.uk/faq/faqjonlee.htm |title=Memories of Jon Lee |work=Nick Brown Online |access-date=29 May 2013}}</ref> that year, the band signed with [[The Echo Label]].

Feeder garnered media attention in 2001 for their third album, ''[[Echo Park (album)|Echo Park]]'', and its lead single, "[[Buck Rogers (song)|Buck Rogers]]", which later became a UK top five single. Jon Lee died by suicide at his Miami home in January 2002, after which the remaining members began to record and play with former [[Skunk Anansie]] drummer [[Mark Richardson (musician)|Mark Richardson]]. They released their fourth album, ''[[Comfort in Sound]]'', later that year; it touched on themes such as loss and coming to terms with death, while also exploring themes of positivity. Richardson was ultimately made an official member, remaining so until May 2009 when he returned to a reformed Skunk Anansie. Feeder have since worked with a roster of drummers live and in the studio, including Tim Trotter, [[Karl Brazil]] and Geoff Holroyde. Between 2010 and 2017, the band charted four more top 20 albums, with the latest of these being 2017's ''[[The Best of Feeder / Arrow|The Best of Feeder]]'' their second consecutive top 10 album. In 2019, the band signed a deal with [[Believe Digital|Believe UK]] to release their tenth studio album, ''[[Tallulah (Feeder album)|Tallulah]]''.

== History ==
=== Early years (1994‚Äì1996) ===
In 1994, Reel/Real's bass player, Julian Smith, left the group. [[Grant Nicholas]] and [[Jon Lee (drummer)|Jon Lee]] went 'back to the drawing board'. They placed an advert in ''[[Loot (magazine)|Loot]]'' for a new bass player.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.musicweek.com/interviews/read/i-think-we-re-gonna-make-it-grant-nicholas-on-21-years-of-feeder/070005 |title=I think we're gonna make it: Grant Nicholas on 21 years of Feeder |last1=Hanley |first1=James |date=3 October 2017 |access-date=24 April 2018 |publisher=NewBay Media |agency=Music Week}}</ref> The advert was answered by [[Taka Hirose]], a Japanese [[ex-pat]] working in London as a [[graphic designer]]. The trio changed their name to Feeder, after Nicholas's pet goldfish.<ref name="FEEDER1997FAQ">{{cite web |url=http://freespace.virgin.net/ali.bunny/feeder/faq.htm |title=Descend FAQ |work=Descend |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014071012/http://freespace.virgin.net/ali.bunny/feeder/faq.htm |archive-date=14 October 2007 |access-date=15 March 2007}}</ref> In 1994, Feeder sent a [[demo tape]] to [[The Echo Label]]. Representatives at Echo listened to the tape, sent an employee to see the band play live, then offered them a record contract.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brent.gov.uk/news.nsf/24878f4b00d4f0f68025663c006c7944/c9eadb4e31d756478025726b004b4c7e!OpenDocument |title=Taka Hirose interview- February 2007 |work=brent.gov.uk |access-date=25 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320170744/http://www.brent.gov.uk/news.nsf/24878f4b00d4f0f68025663c006c7944/c9eadb4e31d756478025726b004b4c7e!OpenDocument |archive-date=20 March 2007 }}</ref>

In 1995, Feeder recorded their first EP, ''[[Two Colours EP|Two Colours]].'' Limited to 1,500 CDs and 1,000 7" vinyls, the band sold ''Two Colours'' at gigs.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.feederanorak.co.uk/releases/release.php?id=1| title=Two Colours CD| publisher=feederanorak.co.uk| access-date=31 August 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.feederanorak.co.uk/releases/release.php?id=56|title=Two Colours 7| publisher=feederanorak.co.uk| access-date=1 March 2007}}</ref> 1996 was an eventful year for Feeder. In February, ''Kerrang!'' and ''Edge'' gave away a promo tape the band made with producer [[Chris Sheldon]].<ref>"Swim" inlay booklet.</ref> Called 'Two Tracker', it featured two songs that would feature on Feeder's [[Polythene (album)|debut album]]. In July, Feeder released their first commercially available release, ''[[Swim (Feeder EP)|Swim]].'' In August, the band made their first appearance at the [[Reading and Leeds festivals|Reading festival]] and in October, they released their first single, "[[Stereo World]]".

=== ''Polythene'' and ''Yesterday Went Too Soon'' (1997‚Äì1999) ===
Feeder's debut album, [[Polythene (album)|''Polythene'']], was released in May 1997. ''Polythene'' was acclaimed by critics, including ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' and ''Kerrang!'', who placed the album at first and sixth in their respective end-of-year lists.<ref name="METALHAMMERLISTS">{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/metal.htm|title=Metal Hammer yearly albums lists|work=rocklist.net|access-date=2 March 2007}}</ref><ref name="KERRANGLISTS">{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/kerrang.html|title=Kerrang! yearly albums lists|work=rocklist.net|access-date=6 February 2007}}</ref> Some critics labelled the band "The UK's answer to the [[Smashing Pumpkins]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://feederscrapbook.co.uk/wordpress/?p=351|title="The Empire Strikes Back!"- Kerrang! article|work=feederscrapbook.co.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007154455/http://feederscrapbook.co.uk/wordpress/?p=351|archive-date=7 October 2007|url-status=dead|access-date=31 March 2007}}</ref> and also drew comparisons to [[The Pixies]] and [[Talk Talk]].<ref name="IOWFEEDER">{{cite web|url=http://www.isleofwightfestival.com/band.aspx?name=Feeder|title=Festival info- Feeder|work=isleofwightfestival.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506043944/http://www.isleofwightfestival.com/band.aspx?name=Feeder|archive-date=6 May 2008|url-status=dead|access-date=12 October 2008}}</ref>

Feeder would go on to release three further singles from ''Polythene'', "[[Tangerine (Feeder song)|Tangerine]]" (charting at No. 60 in the [[UK singles chart]].<ref name="Chartstats">{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/203/feeder/| title=FEEDER ‚Äì full Official Chart History |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |access-date=15 October 2016}}</ref>) and "Cement" (No. 53), "[[Crash (Feeder song)|Crash]]" (No. 48). In October 1997, Feeder released their breakthrough single "[[High (Feeder song)|High]]", which charted at No. 24.<ref name="Chartstats" /> They also reissued ''Polythene'', adding "High" to the track listing, along with some other changes.

In early 1998 Feeder toured the United States as a support act for [[Everclear (band)|Everclear]].<ref name="KERRANG1998TOUR">{{cite web|url=http://feederscrapbook.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/kerrangfeederlivetreat.jpg|title="Feeder Live Treat- They'll Play New Songs For Brit Fans"- Kerrang! article|work=feederscrapbook.co.uk|access-date=31 July 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128155142/http://feederscrapbook.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/kerrangfeederlivetreat.jpg|archive-date=28 November 2007}}</ref> During their tour, the band released a re-worked version of "[[Suffocate (Feeder song)|Suffocate]]" for UK release, which charted at No. 37.<ref name="Chartstats" /> After their return to the UK, they played their own headline tour with Everclear in support.<ref name="KERRANG1998TOUR" /> They stayed in the US for most of the year, playing various [[music festival]]s alongside a headline tour with "High", which had been released to radio stations and charted at No. 24 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart. The band travelled back to the UK to play at [[V Festival|V98]].

In March 1999, Feeder returned with a new single, "[[Day In Day Out (Feeder song)|Day In Day Out]]", which charted at No. 31. Two more singles followed, "Insomnia" in May (charting at No. 22 and resulting in their first appearance on [[Top of the Pops]]<ref name="Chartstats" /><ref name="Kaleidoscope">Pete Seaton and Richard Down.

The album [[Yesterday Went Too Soon]] was released on 30 August. ''Yesterday Went Too Soon'' entered the UK albums chart at No. 8,<ref name="Chartstats" /> an unexpected position for the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://feederscrapbook.co.uk/wordpress/?p=344|title="Maker Shakers"- Melody Maker article|work=feederscrapbook.co.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214133438/http://feederscrapbook.co.uk/wordpress/?p=344|archive-date=14 December 2007|url-status=dead|access-date=21 January 2009}}</ref>

In November, Feeder released a final single from the album, a re-recorded version of "[[Paperfaces]]", which charted at No. 41.<ref name="Chartstats" /> The year ended with the band supporting the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] at [[Wembley Arena]] and [[Manic Street Preachers]] at the [[Millennium Stadium]].

=== ''Echo Park'' and mainstream breakthrough (2000‚Äì2001) ===
Feeder spent most of 2000 writing and recording for their next album. They previewed new material at festivals around the country, including V2000 and [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]]. They would end the year promoting "[[Buck Rogers (song)|Buck Rogers]]", their first single since November 1999 and then playing a mini-tour at the end of the year to mainly showcase the new material. The release of the single on 8 January 2001 was coupled with a signing session at London's now defunct [[Tower Records (music retailer)|Tower Records]] store and then a TV appearance on ''Top of The Pops'' before the single charted.<ref name="Kaleidoscope"/> The single charted at number five, becoming the band's first top 10 entry in the singles chart before appearing on Top of the Pops again.<ref name="Chartstats"/><ref name="Kaleidoscope"/> "Buck Rogers" then spent a second week in the top 10.<ref name="BRSTATS">{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/buck%20rogers/|title=Buck Rogers ‚Äì full Official Chart History|publisher=Official Charts Company|date=15 October 2016}}</ref>

After a sell-out tour of two legs ending at the [[London Astoria]], the album ''Echo Park'' entered at number five in the UK album charts, shortly after "[[Seven Days in the Sun]]", the album's second single charted at No. 14.<ref name="Chartstats"/> Shortly before the single's release, the band's rise up to the mainstream was recognised by the now defunct [[Scottish Television]] live music show ''Boxed Set'', where a half-hour-long live-set with a studio audience was played. A third single, "[[Turn (Feeder song)|Turn]]" reached No. 27 in July before festival season.<ref name="Chartstats"/> "[[Just a Day]]", a b-side from "Seven Days in the Sun", later reached No. 12 in December.<ref name="Chartstats"/> The response the album received on a critical level was mixed, with Dan Genroe of ''Q'' magazine claiming that the listener will still be "feeling hungry half an hour later",<ref name="QECHOPARK">{{cite web|url=http://feederscrapbook.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/qechoparkreview.jpg |title=Q- "Echo Park" review |work=feederscrapbook.co.uk |access-date=12 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031173255/http://feederscrapbook.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/qechoparkreview.jpg |archive-date=31 October 2008  }}</ref> alongside suggesting that the album is "hard to love".<ref name="QECHOPARK"/> Ben Myers of ''Kerrang!'' gave the album 4/5 (KKKK) which indicates "blinding", while citing that the band "hit their stride" on the album,<ref name="KERRANGECHOPARK">{{cite web|url=http://feederscrapbook.co.uk/wordpress/?p=235|title=Kerrang!- "Echo Park" review|work=feederscrapbook.co.uk|access-date=12 October 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728132943/http://feederscrapbook.co.uk/wordpress/?p=235|archive-date=28 July 2011}}</ref> alongside suggesting that the album is "fat free and stripped to the bone".<ref name="KERRANGECHOPARK"/>

The album saw the band adopt a more 'commercial' sound, also incorporating synthesizers.<ref name="MELODYMAKERLINE">{{cite web|url=http://feederscrapbook.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/melodymakergrantphoneinterview2.jpg |title="Straight Down The Line"- Melody Maker interview- 25 July 2000 |work=feederscrapbook.co.uk |access-date=30 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630184323/http://feederscrapbook.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/melodymakergrantphoneinterview2.jpg |archive-date=30 June 2007  }}</ref> Lyrically, ''Echo Park'' contains both a comedic approach, as with "Seven Days in the Sun", and dark emotions, such as those shown on "Turn", "Oxygen", and "Satellite News". It was during the campaign for ''Echo Park'' that the band played another slot on the main stage at the Reading and Leeds festival, including [[T in the Park]]. As of August 2003, the album has shipped 300,000 units in the UK going platinum, with counter sales standing at 293,000 as of February 2005.<ref name="MW"/><ref name="BPI"/> Grant said in a ''Melody Maker'' interview that if the album did not sell well enough the band would probably split up; he said at the time that "It's the same with any band. That's just the way the music business is. There is only a certain amount of money a label will put into a band. I'm just being realistic. We've been around for seven or eight years and I am not planning on giving up, but we're putting everything into this record and I'm just hoping that people like it".<ref name="MELODYMAKERLINE" /> The album campaign helped the band in August 2001 win the "Best British Live Act" accolade at the Kerrang! awards,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/entertainment/1513974.stm|title=Kerrang! awards 2001 report- 28 August 2001|work=bbc.co.uk|access-date=1 March 2007 | date=28 August 2001}}</ref> before ending the year supporting the [[Stereophonics]], and then releasing the "[[Just a Day]]" single in December. In February 2015, "Buck Rogers" gained a silver certification for 200,000 physical sales, digital downloads and streaming points combined. Two years later, "Just a Day" also passed 200,000 sales.

In July 2001, Feeder's EP ''Swim'' was [[Swim (Feeder EP)|re-released]] with extra tracks, being a selection of b-sides from their earlier singles, alongside the videos for the ''[[Polythene (album)|Polythene]]'' singles "[[Crash (Feeder song)|Crash]]" and "[[Cement (song)|Cement]]". Overall unit sales for ''Swim'' stand at 40,000 as of February 2005.<ref name="MW" />

Feeder returned to the studio to record their fifth album ''[[Pushing the Senses]]''.

I demo the album in its full form before the rest of the band play on it. Its difficult to know at this stage what it will turn out like, but so far its slightly more mature sounding". Grant later added "Each album is a journey and a reflection of the past, there is some stuff that touches on what has happened, but there are songs about love, songs of loss and songs about the future. I don't want to give too much away but there's one track called "Bitter Glass". Its quite dark but uplifting too. Its about pulling yourself out of a big hole".<ref>''[[Kerrang!]]'', issue 1005.

=== Mark Richardson's departure and ''Renegades'' (2009‚Äì10) ===
After starting 2009 with two warm-up shows for their tour of Japan in Scarborough and Crewe, the band later on in May announced that Feeder had "ended their partnership" with drummer Mark Richardson, who returned to his original band Skunk Anansie.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.feederfaq.co.uk/#BAND01| title=Feeder FAQ| publisher=feederfaq.co.uk| access-date=12 July 2009}}</ref>  Mark was replaced by session drummer [[Karl Brazil]] who had just come off tour with [[James Blunt]],<ref name="KB">{{cite web| url=http://www.karlbrazil.com| title=News| work=KarlBrazil.com| access-date=3 June 2009}}</ref> and had also played drums for British band [[Ben's Brother]].<ref name="KB"/> Karl's first live appearances with the band, after a series of university events were at the UK leg of the [[Sonisphere Festival]], stating that this would be their only UK festival appearance of 2009, as they would be working on their seventh studio album.<ref name="2009summershows">{{cite web|url=http://www.feederweb.com/news.php?start=0#newsitem|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628075421/http://www.feederweb.com/news.php?start=0#newsitem|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 June 2008|title=NEW SUMMER SHOWS ANNOUNCED|work=Feederweb.com|access-date=15 April 2009}}</ref> It was then later announced that they would be appearing at the [[Hevy Music Festival]] in [[Folkestone]].<ref name="2009summershows"/> Here they previewed a new track titled "Sentimental", with the announcement that they had been in a recording studio in South Wales.

At first, Tim Trotter then of Mexicolas was filling in on drum duties in the studio also as a session drummer, before Karl stepped in.<ref>''Renegades'' album credit notes</ref> With Karl playing drums for [[Robbie Williams]], [[Natalie Imbruglia]] and Ben's Brother, Tim once again took over drum duties in the studio. On 2 December, the band's official webpage was changed to display the word "RENEGADES" and the names of each of the band members by their surname, with "BRAZIL" mentioned amongst these. On 17 December a sample of a new song "Sentimental" was added to their website, which was later replaced with a 20-second clip of another song called "Renegades". Later on that month the website announced a six date tour and the release of a [[Renegades EP|tour-only EP]] which was released on "Big Teeth Music", also their own record label.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.xfm.co.uk/news/2009/feeder-return| title=Feeder Return! - Xfm| publisher=XFM.co.uk| access-date=5 January 2010| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109004841/http://www.xfm.co.uk/news/2009/feeder-return| archive-date=9 January 2010| df=dmy-all}}</ref> After the tour was completed, another six date tour was shortly announced with the band this time playing bigger venues. Another EP was released to coincide with the tour, which included a further four new songs with one of these being titled "Home"; one of the new songs the band performed on their first tour under this alias. The side-project was used as a method to promote the seventh Feeder studio album titled ''Renegades'' at live shows where they would mainly play the new songs, thus avoiding having to play any of their hits if they played as Feeder.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/music-features/renegades-make-good-their-escape-1.1020456| title=Renegades Make Good their Escape| publisher=Herald Scotland| access-date=7 May 2010}}</ref> The side-project would cease in 2010 after playing their final gig as Renegades at that year's Sonisphere Festival.

In an April 2010 interview with South Yorkshire newspaper ''The Star'', Grant expressed his disappointment with the side-project band's sudden increase in success and awareness, in which he claimed that he wanted the band to continue playing in clubs with a slower ascendency to the bigger venues.<ref name="Star">{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/features/Renegades-star-Grant-Nicholas-faces.6216783.jp|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130505062758/http://www.thestar.co.uk/features/Renegades-star-Grant-Nicholas-faces.6216783.jp|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 May 2013|title=Renegades star Grant Nicholas faces echo from the past|work=The Star|access-date=12 April 2010}}</ref> The tour promoter however suggested that Renegades should play slightly bigger venues for the second tour than of those seen on their debut.<ref name="Star"/> Looking back on this version of the band, Grant Nicholas explained in an interview with Culture Deluxe, that the project was not a big marketing plan, but announced it without saying exactly what was happening. Some people thought it was a name change, Grant recording a solo album, while others got the idea from the start. He described problems with promoters printing "Feeder" on the tickets, leading to a misunderstanding that a more mainstream set was expected.<ref name="culturedeluxe">{{cite web |title=Culture Deluxe Interview: Feeder |url=http://www.culturedeluxe.com/music/interview/interview-feeder/ |url-status=dead |work=Culturedeluxe |access-date=9 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101211173239/http://www.culturedeluxe.com/music/interview/interview-feeder/|archive-date=11 December 2010 }}</ref>

After completing their second and final tour as Renegades, the band then announced their new single "[[Call Out (Feeder song)|Call Out]]" under the name of Feeder before shortly revealing the name of their seventh album as ''[[Renegades (Feeder album)|Renegades]]''. All of the new songs performed live as Renegades were listed on the album with the free download track "Fallen" being a b-side on "Call Out" and was released as a download and vinyl single, with the album released on 5 July.

The week after the album's release, "Children of the Sun" was released as the album's second single. It did not chart.

The band continued their year with a main stage appearance at the Isle of Wright Festival, opening the event. This was then followed by a first appearance in four years at the Reading Festival, although in their lowest position since their 1996 debut, headlining the fourth stage. Their appearance at the T in the Park festival that year was later cancelled, due to a band illness. The band played at [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] in August as part of a series of concerts to celebrate the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], which was preceded by an appearance at [[Lusty Glaze]] in Newquay, alongside performances in Wales and Ireland, with the video shoot for "Idaho" in between.

In November, Feeder played five UK dates, starting at the [[O2 Academy Glasgow]].

On 15 June the band announced that the album would be titled ''[[All Bright Electric]]''. The lead single, "Universe of Life" was released on the same day. The album was released on 7 October 2016. This was followed on 26 August by the single "Eskimo", along with its music video. Both singles were released free for people who pre-ordered the album. After the band completed their UK tour between September and October 2016, ''All Bright Electric'' saw Feeder return to the top 10 of the album charts after an eight-year absence, before releasing as a streaming single "Another Day on Earth" from the album, and later releasing a video for the song.

In July 2017, the band announced the compilation ''[[The Best of Feeder]]'', featuring all the previous singles from the band's career, as well a mini-album of new material within called ''Arrow''. Its lead single, "Figure You Out", was released on 20 July 2017. The compilation later charted at No. 10 on the albums chart, giving Feeder their second album to chart in the upper tier in less than a calendar year.

After completing a tour to mark 21 years since the release of ''Swim'', the band began plans to close down their label Big Teeth Music. After the company was listed as "dissolved" on [[Companies House]], with a form showing Nicholas's signature being different to how he signs autographs (alongside dissolving Popping Candy, that served as Nicholas's solo label), the band posted a photo on their Facebook page, that of them signing a new record deal with Believe Music.

On 9 August 2019, Feeder released their tenth studio album, ''[[Tallulah (Feeder album)|Tallulah]]'', before releasing a non-album single, "Criminal" on 1 November of that same year. Although this single failed to chart, the album became the band's most successful studio album in 14 years, due to charting at No.4 in the U.K. album charts on its release week. Reviews were limited, but four out of the five it received from major sources were positive.

Later in the year the band announced a U.K. tour, with Novaclub being the main support act. However, later the following year, the U.K. was facing problems from the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], causing gigs to be rescheduled and the band then rearranging the tour from early 2020 to October, coincidentally being rescheduled on the same day the U.K. went into lockdown. By October it was still deemed unsafe to continue with live shows, so the tour was cancelled with ticket holders refunded. The band cited their reasons as that they would be promoting a two year old album most fans who are interested, would already have owned by then.

After the cancellation, the band then had further festival dates put back, but also had a one-off gig at the Manchester Academy cancelled. The band however still kept optimism that they would play live during 2021, only for The Bug Jam festival headline slot in Wellingborough to go ahead and enable Feeder to become one of the first U.K. headline acts to play live in front of an audience after the pandemic outbreak.

==Sales and legacy==
Between 1997 and 2012, Feeder accumulated 25 top 75 singles when guest singles are excluded. They have headlined many of the UK's major venues, such as Wembley Arena, Birmingham National Indoor Arena, Birmingham LG Arena, Bournemouth International Centre and the Cardiff International Arena.

Feeder's overall album sales stand at 1,957,016 in the United Kingdom, as of 6 October 2017.<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Charts Analysis: Shania Twain takes No. 1 in close battle with Wolf Alice |url=http://www.musicweek.com/analysis/read/official-charts-analysis-shania-twain-takes-no-1-in-close-battle-with-wolf-alice/070064 |publisher=Music Week |access-date=20 October 2017}}</ref> Their second-highest selling release is 2002's ''Comfort in Sound'', shifting over 506,000 units in the UK. As of October 2017, ''The Singles'' has sold 524,000 copies. In the UK, Feeder has accumulated six gold and platinum records. A gold record in Ireland for ''The Singles'' brings their total to seven. In 2020, "[[Buck Rogers (song)|Buck Rogers]]" received a Gold award for 400,000 UK consumption sales, 19 years after its release. 2001's "Just a Day" was certified Silver in 2017 for 200,000 consumption sales. That same year also seen 1997's ''Polythene'', receive a Gold award from the BPI for sales of 100,000; almost 20 years to its release date.

Despite having dropped out of mainstream radio play since 2008, ''Silent Cry'' reached No. 8 on the UK albums chart in its first week of release, with 16,000 units sold. It has sold less than 50,000 units to date according to Chrysalis, the owners of the now defunct Echo Label. The ''Silent Cry'' tour was Feeder's longest, playing 29 dates, with many selling out. Nevertheless, ''Silent Cry'' remains Feeder's first album not to achieve at least gold status.

2010's ''Renegades'' was less successful. It entered the UK chart at No. 16 ‚Äì Feeder's first album since 1997's ''Polythene'' not to chart within the Top 10 ‚Äì and dropped out after 2 weeks. However, the charting of ''Renegades'', marked the third decade in which a Feeder album had been released and charted at least in the Top 20. This marked their 6th studio album to appear in the Top 20 and the band's 9th album to appear on the chart regardless of position over the course of their career. The album also debuted at No. 1 on the Official UK Rock Albums chart.<ref name="17 July 2010" /> Still, ''Renegades'' has yet to accumulate sales that approach or eclipse any of their other studio albums before this. 2012 follow-up ''Generation Freakshow'', charted higher at No. 13 although on lower debut week sales, before 2016 saw the band return to the top 10 with ''All Bright Electric'', then less than 12 months later appeared in the top 10 again, with ''The Best of Feeder'' in 2017. 2019's ''Tallulah'', became the band's first top 5 studio album since 2005's ''Pushing the Senses''.

Feeder are also one of Wales' most popular rock bands. In October 2003, the bass guitar that Taka Hirose played in the video for "Seven Days in the Sun" was added to the [[Hard Rock Cafe]] in [[Cardiff]].

Feeder have also gained a cult following in Japan. Their most recent seven studio albums have all charted in the top 200. Their most successful of these is 2008's ''Silent Cry'' charting at No. 53, although their most successful and only top 40 entry to date is their 2006 singles compilation, meaning the band have charted eight albums regardless of format.

In April 2012, ''[[Total Guitar]]'' praised the band, writing that "all the way from their first release, the ''Two Colours EP'' in 1995, through tragedy and triumph, he's [Grant] gone the distance with Feeder, while other British alternative rock bands of the 90s crashed or faded".<ref name="total guitar">{{cite book |last=Laing |first=Rob |year=2012 |title=Total Guitar - Come Back Around |publisher=[[Future plc]] |pages=56‚Äì60}}</ref>

They were inducted into ''Kerrang''{{'}}s Hall of Fame in August 2019. Their induction came two months after Grant presented Skunk Anansie with their Hall of Fame award at the ''Kerrang'' Awards ceremony. This event marked the first time in ten years that Grant Nicholas had shared the same stage with former drummer Mark Richardson.
