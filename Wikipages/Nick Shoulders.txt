'''Nicklaus Robert Shoulders''' is an American [[Country music|country]] singer-songwriter from [[Fayetteville, Arkansas]]. After achieving local success with his [[punk rock]] band Thunderlizards in the early 2010s and playing harmonica and [[banjo]] with [[Shawn James (musician)|Shawn James and the Shapeshifters]], in 2017 Shoulders began releasing [[country music]] as a solo artist.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.fayettevilleflyer.com/2012/07/03/flyer-profile-thunderlizards/ | title = Flyer Profile: Thunderlizards | last = Barrett | first = Roger | date = July 3, 2012 | website = Fayetteville Flyer | access-date = April 7, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.allmusic.com/album/bear-mw0002624265 | title = Bear – Shawn James | website = AllMusic | access-date = April 7, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.fayettevilleflyer.com/2020/12/11/nick-shoulders-returns-home-preps-new-album-and-label/ | title = Nick Shoulders returns home, preps new album and label | last = Barrett | first = Roger | date = December 11, 2020 | website = Fayetteville Flyer | access-date = April 7, 2021}}</ref> His solo work has reached a much wider audience, beginning with a performance of his original song "Rather Low" gathering considerable momentum on YouTube.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/nick-shoulders-home-on-the-rage-interview | title = Ozark Outlaw Nick Shoulders Challenges Southern Preconceptions on "Home on the Rage" | last = Mitchell | first = Matt | date = April 7, 2021 | website = Bandcamp | access-date = April 7, 2021}}</ref> Shoulders has been praised for his distinctive vocal style, which incorporates influences from [[Country_music#First_generation_(1920s)|early country music]] in the form of [[yodelling]] and [[whistling]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.kuaf.com/post/crooner-artist-transitions-punk-honky-tonk#stream/0 | title = Crooner, Artist Transitions from Punk to Honky Tonk | last = Dennis | first = Timothy| date = August 16, 2019 | website = KUAF | access-date = April 7, 2021}}</ref>

In addition to his music, Nick is also an accomplished illustrator having attended Rocky Mountain College of Art and Design in Denver, CO. His artwork has been notably featured on beer cans of the Fossil Cove Brewing Company in Fayetteville, AR.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fossilcovebrewing.com/beers|title=Fossil Cove Brewing Company}}</ref> He has created additional mural installations in Fayetteville at The Smoke and Barrel Tavern <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fayettevilleflyer.com/2015/07/21/new-mural-project-complete-off-dickson-street/|title = New mural project complete off Dickson Street}}</ref> and The Little Bread Company.<ref>https://www.instagram.com/p/BgRjpovHDd0/?tagged=blockstreet&hl=en. littlebread.com</ref> 

Shoulders has been outspoken in questioning the culture of modern country music: In a 2020 article for [[In These Times]], he criticised "fake twang" – the imitation of the [[Southern_American_English|Southern accent]] by musicians who are not from the [[American South]], considering this practice symptomatic of the close association between mainstream country music, [[White_people|whiteness]] and [[Conservatism in the United States]]. This association, he argued, failed to "acknowledge the diverse and complicated origin of these uniquely American musical forms", as well as the diversity of the rural United States as a whole, and he expressed the aspiration to help make country music "more accessible and more welcoming to people outside of the white rural experience".<ref>{{cite web | url = https://inthesetimes.com/article/country-music-southern-accent-conservatism-confederacy-ken-burns-blues | title = Fake Twang: How White Conservatism Stole Country Music | last = Shoulders | first = Nick | date = March 21, 2020 | website = In These Times| access-date = April 7, 2021}}</ref>
