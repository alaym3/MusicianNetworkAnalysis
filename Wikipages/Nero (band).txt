==History==
Ray and Stephens were both born in 1984. Ray grew up in [[Northwood, London]] whilst Stephens grew up in [[Notting Hill]]. The boys met Watson when they were 18. Ray played classical [[guitar]] and Stephens played [[cello]] with encouragement from his free-jazz musician father. By the time a mutual friend introduced them at the age of 17, Stephens was attending the specialist music school at [[Pimlico]]. Outside school both were making electronic music on home computers. They began working together at 17, setting up a studio in Stephens' bedroom. The latter had already been a fan of [[Drum and bass|jungle music]] after seeing M-Beat featuring [[General Levy]] on [[Top of the Pops]] in 1994. Ray's epiphany (according to ''Q''), happened in the London club [[Fabric (club)|Fabric]] where the duo's ideas about producing were cemented.<ref name="q_dec_2011">Stubbs, Dan. [[Q (magazine)|Q magazine]]. December 2011. They Came From Outta Bass. pp 88-92.</ref>

Nero's debut release was "Space 2001" as part of the "Straight Outta Leicester" three piece vinyl LP on Reformed Recordings in 2004. Watson started featuring on Nero's songs from 2008, namely "Solid Air" (Punchy Recordings) and "This Way" (Audio Freaks) which was their debut dubstep release, and is now a full-time member of the band.

Nero released the EP, 'Requiem', 10 May 2006, predominantly hard drum and bass, which quickly saw their acknowledgement rise within the dance music scene.

[[Sasha Frere-Jones]], journalist for the ''[[New Yorker Magazine]]'', listed Nero's [[remix]] of [[The Streets]], "Blinded by the Lights" in his top songs of 2009.<ref>{{cite web|last=Frere |first=Sasha |url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/sashafrerejones/2009/12/the-best-recordings-of-2009-annotated-version.html |title=Sasha Frere-Jones: The Best Recordings of 2009: Annotated Version |work=The New Yorker |date=1 August 2011 |access-date=29 February 2012}}</ref> The track had radio airplay in the U.K. as well as being played by DJs including [[Chase & Status]], [[Skream]], [[Tiësto]] and [[Diplo (DJ)|Diplo]].

On 10 April, it was announced that the album is called ''[[Between II Worlds]]'', and it would be released on 28 August 2015 (coinciding with their recurring use of the number '2808') but the release date was later delayed to 11 September.

===Side projects and new material (2016–present)===
Group members Dan Stephens and Alana Watson got married in December 2015. They announced in June 2017 that they were expecting a baby and that Alana would not be resuming her touring duties until the baby's arrival in 2018.<ref name="dancing">{{cite web|last1=McCarthy|first1=Will|title=Nero's Alana Watson and Dan Stephens are having a baby|url=https://dancingastronaut.com/2017/06/nero-alana-watson-dan-stephens-baby-together/|website=Dancing Astronaut|access-date=28 March 2018|ref=dancing}}</ref>

NERO focused more on side projects after the release of ''Between II Worlds''. This was done to destress from the sudden popularity of their second album and subsequent creative pressure to deliver on the followup. Joe Ray launched a solo project in 2017, while Stephens and Watson announced a new electronic pop project The Night in March 2018. During promotion for The Night, Stephens and Watson clarified that Nero was still active alongside the side projects, with new music in the works.<ref name="fabric">{{cite web|title=In Conversation: Catching up with Nero|url=https://www.fabriclondon.com/blog/view/in-conversation-catching-up-with-nero|website=fabric blog|publisher=Fabric London|access-date=28 March 2018|ref=fabric}}</ref><ref name="ukf">{{cite web|last1=Jenkins|first1=Dave|title=Everything You Need To Know About The Night|url=https://ukf.com/news/everything-need-know-night/21605|website=UKF|publisher=AEI Group LTD|access-date=28 March 2018|ref=ukf}}</ref>

In 2021 during the lead-up to the 10th Anniversary of Welcome Reality, the debut album, the band released three remixes of classics from Daft Punk, Frankie Goes to Hollywood and Disciples after a nearly two year silence. <ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-03-31|title=NERO continue to stack unreleased edits—stream their spin on Frankie Goes to Hollywood's 'Relax' - Dancing Astronaut NERO continue to stack unreleased edits—stream their spin on Frankie Goes to Hollywood's 'Relax'|url=https://dancingastronaut.com/2021/03/nero-continue-to-stack-unreleased-edits-stream-their-spin-on-frankie-goes-to-hollywoods-relax/|access-date=2021-04-02|website=Dancing Astronaut|language=en-US}}</ref>
