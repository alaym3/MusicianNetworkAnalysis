'''The Kooks''' ({{IPAc-en|k|uː|k|s}}) are an English [[indie rock]] band formed in 2004 in [[Brighton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/thekooksofficial/info?tab=page_info|title=The Kooks - About|publisher=Facebook}}</ref> The band consists of Luke Pritchard (vocals/rhythm guitar), Hugh Harris (lead guitar/synthesizer/bass) and Alexis Nunez (drums).

Their music is primarily influenced by the 1960s [[British Invasion]] movement and [[post-punk revival]] of the new millennium.<ref name = "Prefix" /> The Kooks have experimented in several genres including [[rock music|rock]], [[Britpop]], [[pop music|pop]], [[reggae]], [[ska]], and more recently, [[funk]] and [[hip-hop]], being described once as a "more energetic [[The Thrills|Thrills]] or a looser [[Sam Roberts Band]], maybe even a less severe [[Arctic Monkeys]] at times".<ref>{{cite web|url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r821896/review|pure_url=yes}}|title = The Kooks, Inside In/Inside Out Review|website = [[Allmusic]]|access-date = 30 September 2009}}</ref>

Signed to [[Virgin Records]] just three months after forming, the Kooks broke into the musical mainstream with their debut album ''[[Inside In/Inside Out]]'' (2006). The album was ultimately successful, achieving quadruple platinum status in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] within a year and also overseas in the form of a platinum certification in [[Australia]] and two times platinum in [[Ireland]]. The Kooks found themselves entering into mainstream media attention, with the band winning the award for Best UK & Ireland Act at the [[MTV Europe Music Awards 2006]] and picking up a nomination at [[The Brit Awards]] for the single "[[She Moves in Her Own Way]]".<ref name = "MTVAward">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6109030.stm| title= Host Timberlake in MTV double win|work= BBC News| access-date = 9 June 2009 | date=3 November 2006}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web | url=https://www.nme.com/news/muse/25876| title= Brit Nomination for She Moves in Her Own Way |work=[[NME]] | access-date = 9 June 2009}}</ref> With their follow-up ''[[Konk (album)|Konk]]'' (2008) debuting at number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]], it recorded first week sales of 65,000, achieving gold status in both the UK and Ireland.<ref name="UK">{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/|title=The Official Charts Company - The Kooks|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|access-date=12 July 2009}}</ref> Their third studio album, entitled ''[[Junk of the Heart]]'', was released on 12 September 2011.

==History==

===Formation and early years (2002–2004)===
[[File:Britoutside.jpg|thumb|upright|Garred, Pritchard and Harris met at the [[BRIT School]]]]
Three members (Garred, Pritchard and Harris) of the Kooks all met as students at the [[BRIT School]] in Croydon, all three moving further south to join BIMM ([[British and Irish Modern Music Institute]]) (where they met Rafferty, who was from Brighton) in 2002.<ref name = "BBC3" /> The inspiration to form a band came to Pritchard as he and Garred were out shopping for clothes one day in Primark as a joke. Speaking to [[MTV]] Garred said, "we had a vision on how we wanted the band to look and stuff—so we bought some clothes and these hats, it was fun."<ref name = "MTV3">{{cite web|url = http://www.mtv.com/news/yhif/the_kooks/|title = The Kooks|publisher = MTV|access-date = 26 September 2009}}</ref> Sharing a love of [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[the Police]], and [[David Bowie]], Pritchard got Harris and Rafferty involved under the guise of a school music project.<ref name = "BBC3">{{cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/lincolnshire/content/articles/2006/08/15/the_kooks_preview_feature.shtml|title = The Kooks come to the Farm|publisher = BBC|access-date = 26 September 2009}}</ref> Pritchard himself said "We got together just on a whim, really."<ref name="Billboard">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1055486/the-kooks|title=The Kooks|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=23 September 2009}}</ref> With a strong demo of their material Garred and Pritchard went in search of a gig, and according to Garred, they were able to book their first show simply because the landlord liked their hats. "So we went in to get a gig, we don't have a demo blid burnt, and this guy told us, 'Well, you can't get a gig if you don't have a demo, but I like your hats, so I'm going to give you a gig'", said Garred. However, the band was unable to make the performance as they were finishing off their demo at the time.<ref name = "MTV3" />

Taking their name from the [[Kooks (song)|David Bowie song with the same title]], Pritchard revealed the first song they ever played as a group was a [[cover version]] of [[the Strokes]]' song "[[Reptilia (song)|Reptilia]]".<ref name="ohm">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.musicomh.com/music/features/kooks_1005.htm| title= Interview with The Kooks |magazine= MusicOMH| access-date= 15 June 2009}}</ref> The Kooks recorded an [[Extended play|EP]] demo, sending it out in search of [[Gig (music)|gigs]]; they instead received offers from managers and record companies.<ref name="Billboard" /> The band had only been together as a group for four months when they signed with [[Virgin Records]],<ref name="Billboard" /> after being spotted by several label scouts at the Brighton Free Butt Festival in 2005.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/wiltshire/content/articles/2008/01/29/kooks_swindon_gig_feature.shtml| title= The Kooks to play Swindon |publisher= BBC | access-date= 15 June 2009}}</ref> In an interview with [[musicOMH]], Pritchard revealed "It was really quick how it all happened, we did a demo with a mate of ours in London, which we sent off to one guy to get some gigs, and he turned out to be a manager. He rung us up and it kind of went from there."<ref name="ohm" /> The members of the band have since revealed that they felt they weren't ready at the time, "We were way too early to sign a record deal ... We were really young, we'd been together like two or three months, so we really didn't want to sign. But then we thought it's a really good opportunity and Virgin seemed like really cool people - they just seemed to really understand where we were coming from.,"<ref name="ohm" /> said Pritchard, who has also complimented the space the record label allowed for the band to grow, "They were patient with us and let us develop our style, whatever it was."<ref name="Billboard" />

===''Inside In/Inside Out'' (2005–2007)===
{{main|Inside In/Inside Out}}
[[File:The Kooks at Irving Plaza 11-May-2007.jpg|thumb|The Kooks at [[Irving Plaza]], 11 May 2007]]

After they had signed to [[Virgin Records]], the Kooks were reluctant to record an album straight away, stating a desire to focus more on their live performances and songwriting. The band has said embarking on their first live tour instead of recording an album initially helped them develop their style and sound. As Pritchard claimed, "We didn’t sit down with a blueprint. We just naturally developed and we didn’t try to shape or mould ourselves to anything."<ref name="ThePost">{{cite web| url= http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2008/05/04/story32476.asp| title= The Kooky crew| work= [[The Sunday Business Post|Sunday Business Post]]| access-date= 6 October 2009| url-status= dead| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080702143507/http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2008/05/04/story32476.asp| archive-date= 2 July 2008| df= dmy-all}}</ref> As a result, they went into the studio with hundreds of songs from a variety of genres, and it took an "incredible amount of patience" from producer Tony Hoffer to shape the content into what would become the record.<ref name="Billboard" />

Following their first tour supporting [[the Thrills]],<ref name="GIGWISE2">{{cite news|url = http://www.gigwise.com/article.php?id=6170&page_no=2|title = The Kooks are Hunky Dory|work = [[Gigwise]]|access-date = 29 September 2009}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> the Kooks recorded their debut album, ''[[Inside In/Inside Out]]'', at [[Konk (recording)|Konk studios]] in London in 2005.<ref name = "KOOKSDEBUT">{{cite web | url=https://www.nme.com/news/the-kooks/21555 | title= The Kooks Reveal New Album|work=[[NME]]| access-date= 15 June 2009}}</ref> Though media attention was dominated by the release of the [[Arctic Monkeys]] debut album ''[[Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not]]'' on the same day, ''Inside In/Inside Out'' recorded first week sales of 19,098. Later, speaking to ''[[NME]]'', Pritchard would thank the Arctic Monkeys for "shielding" The Kooks from the press' scrutiny. "God bless the Arctic Monkeys because if it wasn't for them we wouldn't have been so shielded. We were so overshadowed by the success [of ''[[Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not]]''] because it was so monster and we crept in behind everybody's back."<ref>{{cite magazine|url = https://www.nme.com/news/the-kooks/25483|title = The Kooks heap praise on Arctic Monkeys|magazine = [[NME]]|access-date = 30 September 2009}}</ref> Entering the [[UK Albums Chart]] at number nine, it would eventually peak at number 2 for two weeks. Singles "Eddie's Gun", "Sofa Song", "You Don't Love Me", "[[Naïve (song)|Naïve]]", "[[She Moves in Her Own Way]]" and "[[Ooh La]]" achieved chart success in the UK and Europe, while "Naïve" and "She Moves in Her Own Way" put The Kooks in the top ten for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.officialcharts.com/archive/official-albums-chart/|title = The Official Charts Company - Inside In/Inside Out|publisher = [[Official Charts Company]]|access-date = 30 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?storycode=1033970| title= Kooks top albums chart with first week sales of 65,901|work=Music Week| access-date= 14 June 2009}}</ref>

Kev Kharas, in his review for [[Drowned in Sound]], viewed the Kooks as "a less irreverent and more melodic [[Art Brut]], swapping that band’s caustic wit for a far nicer type of honesty."<ref name = "DIS">{{cite magazine|url = http://drownedinsound.com/releases/7023/reviews/591891-|title = The Kooks: Inside In/Inside Out|magazine = [[Drowned in Sound]]|access-date = 26 September 2009|archive-date = 10 October 2012|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121010150903/http://drownedinsound.com/releases/7023/reviews/591891-|url-status = dead}}</ref> Kharas also noted traces of "[[emo]]" in the band's style.<ref name = "DIS"/> [[AllMusic]]'s Tim Sendra noted that the band's direction was "heavily indebted to [[classic rock]]", in particular [[Thin Lizzy]] and the [[Dexys Midnight Runners|Dexys]], ultimately though Sendra felt "the band sounds like the Kooks and no one else". Calling the Kooks "an important reminder that there are just as many mediocre bands in the UK as there are in the United States" reviewer Jenny Eliscu of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' claimed the album was "utterly forgettable, shoddily produced retro rock that at its worst sounds like a [[Brighton]]-accented version of the [[Spin Doctors]]".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/11759355/review/12053907/inside_in__inside_out | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023073500/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/11759355/review/12053907/inside_in__inside_out | url-status=dead | archive-date=23 October 2006 | title= Review For Inside In/Inside Out| work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]| access-date= 15 June 2009}}</ref> Brian Belardi of ''Prefix'' gave a positive review, describing ''Inside In/Inside Out'' as "An almost-perfect blend of '60s-style [[Britpop]], '90s-style Britpop, and the [[post-punk]] of the new millennium".<ref name = "Prefix">{{cite web | url=http://www.prefixmag.com/reviews/the-kooks/inside-ininside-out/15574/ | title= Review For Inside In/Inside Out| work=Prefix| access-date= 15 June 2009}}</ref>

=== Rafferty's departure and ''Konk'' (2008) ===
{{main|Konk (album)|l1=Konk}}
Rafferty was fired from the band on 31 January 2008, after a series of absences due to illness and long-standing rumours about his place in the band; [[drug addiction]] was also quoted as one of the reasons for his departure.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nme.com/news/the-kooks/35815| title= Bassist's Departure Down to Drugs|work=[[NME]] | access-date= 14 June 2009}}</ref> Rafferty subsequently refuted these claims, saying that he had been fired from the band because he "didn't think ''Konk'' was very good, and I said that."<ref>{{cite news |title=Max Rafferty: 'The Kooks sacked me because I thought 'Konk' was rubbish' |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-kooks-14-1282186 |access-date=14 January 2021 |work=NME |date=29 October 2011}}</ref> [[Dan Logan]], bassist with a local [[Brighton]] band Cat the Dog, was drafted in as a temporary replacement for Rafferty.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nme.com/news/thekooks/33967| title= Kooks Bassist Quits The Band|work=[[NME]] | access-date= 14 June 2009}}</ref> After the departure of Rafferty, the band had considered splitting up.

[[File:The Kooks 1.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=|Harris and Pritchard at Summercase 2008 in Barcelona]]

The Kooks released their second album, ''[[Konk (album)|Konk]]'', in April 2008. The record was named after the studio where it was recorded and produced by Tony Hoffer, who worked on the band's debut album, ''Inside In/Inside Out''.<ref name="KonkDiscuss">{{cite web | url=https://www.nme.com/news/the-kooks/33083| title= The Kooks reveal new album details|work=[[NME]]| access-date= 14 June 2009}}</ref> Prior to releasing the album, in an interview with ''[[NME]]'', lead singer Luke Pritchard had claimed to have 80-90 songs written for the album, stating, "I want this album to be big……I've got an ego, I want the album to do well. I want our singles to come on the radio and for people to literally have their heads blown off by them".<ref>{{cite web| url= http://web.nme.com/news/nme/31774| title= Luke Pritchard Talks About Konk| work= [[NME]]| access-date= 14 June 2009| url-status= dead| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081022143354/http://web.nme.com/news/nme/31774| archive-date= 22 October 2008| df= dmy-all}}</ref> Recorded over a total of seven weeks in London and Los Angeles Pritchard told ''NME'' the band had wanted more input into their second album. "Tony's a genius, but this time we wanted more involvement in the production," said Pritchard.<ref name="KonkDiscuss" />

''Konk'' went on to debut on the [[UK Albums Chart]] at number one with first week sales of 65,901 units.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?storyCode=1033968&sectioncode=22|publisher=Musicweek| title= Konk kicks Duffy off top slot | access-date= 14 June 2009}}</ref> The album also spawned three top 50 hits including their highest chart performer to date, "[[Always Where I Need to Be]]", which peaked at number three.
In the United States, it reached number 41 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and the album's first single, "[[Always Where I Need to Be]]", peaked at number 22 on the [[Alternative Songs]] chart. The album was certified gold in both the UK and Ireland. A second limited edition two disc version of ''Konk'' entitled ''[[Konk (album)|RAK]]'' was also released. The name was taken from the London studio where The Kooks recorded seven new live tracks along with the [[Arctic Monkeys]] and Mike Crossey, producer for [[The Zutons]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.mtv.co.uk/artists/the-kooks/news/41392-the-kooks-announce-double-album-release|title = The Kooks Announce Double Album Release|publisher = MTV|access-date = 26 September 2009}}</ref>

=== ''Junk of the Heart'' (2009–2013) ===
{{main|Junk of the Heart}}
[[File:The Kooks @ Sir Stewart Bovell Park (8 1 12) (6693052329).jpg|thumb|upright|Performing at [[Southbound (festival)|Southbound]], January 2012]]
In April 2009, the Kooks revealed to BBC's ''[[Newsbeat]]'' that they were working on their third studio album. Drummer Paul Garred left the band in late 2009, due to a nerve problem in his arm, and was temporarily replaced initially by Nicholas Millard from the band [[Crackout (Band)|Crackout]], then Chris Prendergast for live shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://onmilwaukee.com/music/articles/kooksreview.html |title=Music: The Kooks rock Turner Hall Ballroom |publisher=Onmilwaukee.com |date=2 June 2008 |access-date=31 March 2012}}</ref> However, Paul returned for the recording sessions in late 2010, while continuing to not tour with the band, as Pritchard recently stated his injury "turned more into a psychological thing" whereby he "feels uncomfortable playing for long periods of time" for fear of his arm "flaring up".  One of the band's first main attempts at writing for this album together took place away from their usual surroundings, as frontman Luke Pritchard told Newsbeat, "We kind of barricaded ourselves in the countryside for a few weeks—stayed at some friend's who have a cottage in Norfolk." However, the band recently revealed that over two weeks there, the band only managed to make one new song: "Eskimo Kiss". After hiring and firing new producer [[Jim Abbiss]] ([[Arctic Monkeys]], [[Kasabian]], [[Adele]]) despite having some "really good sessions together", the band returned to previous producer Tony Hoffer who gave them a "new direction" and they recorded the album in a more contemporary style.

In January 2011, Pritchard announced that they had recorded fourteen new tracks. The band announced via social media that they had finished the new album on 30 March, which was eventually announced as ''[[Junk of the Heart]]''. The first single taken from the album was "Is It Me" for Europe and "Junk of the Heart" elsewhere. The album was released in Europe on 9 September 2011 and in the U.K. on 12 September. Garred appeared in the promotional videos for "Is It Me" and "Junk of the Heart", and performed with the band in live sessions for [[Live from Abbey Road#Series 4|Live from Abbey Road]] and [[Live Lounge]]. But for 2011 shows in the months prior to the album's release, Prendergast was still on drums, and when the band went on tour in October, they brought in session drummer Denny Weston who continued until mid-2012. Garred finally left the band in November,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/33406664/ex-jls-and-the-kooks-members-on-life-after-the-band|title=Ex-JLS and The Kooks members on life after the band}}</ref> with Alexis Nunez (formerly of [[Golden Silvers]]) joining in mid-2012 as The Kooks' new touring drummer before eventually becoming a full member.

On 21 November 2016, the Kooks announced a 'Best Of' UK Tour to take place in April and May 2017 to mark their tenth anniversary as a band, in which they were planning to perform hits, b-sides and brand new music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/kooks-return-mammoth-best-uk-tour-2017-1868148|title=The Kooks return for mammoth ‘Best Of’ UK tour in 2017|last=Jones|first=Damian|work=NME|date=21 November 2016|access-date=29 April 2017}}</ref> To coincide with the tour, on 31 March 2017 the band announced the upcoming release of ''The Best of... So Far'', as well as releasing "Be Who You Are", one of two new songs included on the compilation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/listen-to-the-kooks-new-single-be-who-you-are-as-they-announce-best-of-album-2031105|title=Listen to The Kooks’ new single ‘Be Who You Are’ as they announce Best Of album|last=Levine|first=Nick|work=NME|date=31 March 2017|access-date=29 April 2017}}</ref> Pritchard stressed that this compilation and tour did not signal the end of the band, stating, "It’s been the greatest pleasure to work, travel, fight, hate and love the best and most talented people I’ve met in my life. It’s the greatest job in the world and we don’t intend to stop any time soon."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/03/the-kooks-announce-greatest-hits-album-and-share-n.html|title=The Kooks Announce Greatest Hits Album, Share New Song|last=Shelter|first=Carter|work=Paste|date=31 March 2017|access-date=29 April 2017}}</ref>

The two new tracks were produced by [[Brandon Friesen]], who had also been overseeing sessions for the band's next studio album. Consisting of songs written by Pritchard while the other band members spent time with their families, the new album is deemed to be more of a band effort, as opposed to ''Listen'' which was constructed individually. "This one’s very much 'us' – all rehearsing songs, all arranging songs, all playing together. It’s got the same sort of energy that we had on our first couple of albums, which we were probably running away from a little bit for a while, but now we’ve gone back to it," said Pritchard. "Brandon Friesen, our producer, has taken more of a production role than me, so I won’t be taking the credit. On ''Listen'', me and Inflo worked together everyday. But this one’s been much more of a band record. It’s been far more collaborative."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/photos/kooks-behind-the-scenes-new-album-photos-2031036#ho2KmItFcyAujEr6.99|title=The Kooks take us inside the studio – exclusive pics and interview|author=NME Blog|work=NME|date=31 March 2017|access-date=29 April 2017}}</ref>

==Musical style and influences==
{{quote box|align=right|width=27%|quote="It's just like an idea, like a chorus, and then we just jam on it – it happens in loads of different ways. The best songs I find always come from the subconscious, like when you don't think. Not to be pretentious about it, but usually songs just blurt out rather than thinking about it. I never write lyrics and then do a song, I find that really hard – that's like a real skill."|source=— Pritchard on The Kooks' song-writing<ref name = "ohm"/>}}

The Kooks have mentioned drawing on a number of varied sources to create their sound, listing the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, Bob Dylan and [[Chris de Burgh]] among influences on songwriting style and musical presentation over the course of their four albums.<ref name="ohm" />

The band's debut album ''[[Inside In/Inside Out]]'' was touted as a typical [[Britpop]] record, and was influenced by [[the Libertines]], [[Thin Lizzy]], [[the Police]] and containing elements of the 60s British pop movement.<ref name = "Prefix" /> Pritchard’s lyrical style was compared to that of a "younger, less pathetic version of [[Pete Doherty|Pete Doherty's]] mush-mouth style".<ref name="Prefix" /> The band themselves felt the album was not consistent in its direction. "The first record was definitely genre-hopping. [...] The first album was finding its feet, it was gadabout", said Harris in an interview for ''[[The Sunday Business Post]]''.<ref name="ThePost" />

On the follow-up ''[[Konk (album)|Konk]]'', the band attempted to find a more mature and polished sound. Drawing on a much wider choice of material for the album (about 80 to 90 new songs had been accumulated within the band's repertoire by this stage), the band began to incorporate more a hard-edged [[rock music|rock]] focus into their music.<ref name = "Guardian">{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/11/popandrock2| title= Konk Review| work=[[The Guardian]] | access-date= 14 June 2009 | location=London | first=Betty | last=Clarke | date=11 April 2008}}</ref> Critics drew comparisons to the work of [[The Kinks]] throughout the album, it being recorded at the studio owned by [[Ray Davies]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/the-kooks-konk | title = Review of Konk | publisher = popmatters.com | access-date = 2 August 2009}}</ref> Also noted were the band’s growing similarities in musical direction to [[The Fratellis]] and the [[Arctic Monkeys]].<ref>{{cite web | url= http://uk.launch.yahoo.com/080417/33/21yq9.html |title = Konk Review | publisher = [[Yahoo]] | access-date = 2 August 2009}}</ref> "I think we've made a dynamic album", Pritchard said. "Every song has its own character. It's a good pop album."<ref name="KonkDiscuss" />

Their fourth album, ''[[Listen (The Kooks album)|Listen]]'', includes much more percussion and cross rhythms than previous material.<ref name="soundofboston2">{{cite web|last1=Bedian|first1=Knar|title=Interview: The Kooks Talk "Listen"|url=http://soundofboston.com/interview-the-kooks-talk-listen/|website=Sound of Boston|access-date=24 July 2014}}</ref> Pritchard described [[Listen (The Kooks album)|Listen]] as “percussion sonnets”.<ref name="soundofboston2"/> “The first couple albums I made I never really thought about rhythms, I focused on the recording and the lyrics”, Pritchard said.<ref name="soundofboston2"/>
