'''Arctic Monkeys''' are an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Sheffield]] in 2002. The group consists of [[Alex Turner]] (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards), [[Jamie Cook]] (guitar, keyboards), [[Nick O'Malley]] (bass guitar, backing vocals), and [[Matt Helders]] (drums, backing vocals). Former band member [[Andy Nicholson]] (bass guitar, backing vocals) left the band in 2006 shortly after their debut album was released.

Arctic Monkeys were heralded as one of the first bands to come to public attention via the [[Internet]], with commentators suggesting they represented the possibility of a change in the way in which new bands are promoted and marketed.<ref name="The Question2">{{cite news |last=Laura |first=Barton  |author-link=Laura Barton |date=25 October 2005 |title=The question: Have the Arctic Monkeys changed the music business? |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/oct/25/popandrock.arcticmonkeys |access-date=5 June 2006}}</ref> Their debut album, ''[[Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not]]'' (2006), became the fastest-selling debut album in [[UK Albums Chart|UK chart]] history, and has been hailed as one of the greatest debut albums.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 100 Best Debut Albums of All Time. 30.

They went on to release ''[[Humbug (album)|Humbug]]'' (2009) and ''[[Suck It and See]]'' (2011).

The band's global recognition increased with their critically acclaimed fifth album ''[[AM (Arctic Monkeys album)|AM]]'' (2013), which was supported by the global hit "[[Do I Wanna Know?]]". It topped four [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] charts and was certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] in the US. At the [[2014 BRIT Awards]], the album became their third to win [[Brit Award for British Album of the Year|British Album of the Year]].<ref name="BRIT Awards">{{cite web|last=Bramley|first=Ellie Violet|date=19 February 2014|title=Arctic Monkeys add album prize to group gong at Brits|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/19/arctic-monkeys-win-british-album-of-the-year-2014-brits|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302143342/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/19/arctic-monkeys-win-british-album-of-the-year-2014-brits|archive-date=2 March 2014|access-date=23 February 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> Their sixth album, ''[[Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino]]'' (2018), was a major departure from the band's previous guitar-heavy work, instead being piano-oriented. It received a [[Best Alternative Music Album]] nomination at the [[2019 Grammy Awards]], their second to do so after ''Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not''.

As of 2021, Arctic Monkeys have sold over 20 million records worldwide. In the United Kingdom, the band became the first independent-label band to debut at number one in the UK with their first six albums. The band have won seven [[Brit Awards]]; winning [[BRIT Award for British Group|Best British Group]] and [[Brit Award for British Album of the Year|British Album of the Year]] three times; a [[Mercury Prize]] for ''Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not'', an [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Award]], and 20 [[NME Awards]].

Alex Turner described ''AM'' as the band's "most original [album] yet," merging hip-hop drum beats with 1970s heavy rock.

According to the band, their fifth album ''AM'' is more [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] influenced.

Their sixth album ''Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino'' took on a different direction, substituting the guitar-heavy sound from their previous albums for a more complex, piano-based style of composition.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/arctic-monkeys-new-album-tranquility-base-hotel-interview-w519741|last=Weiner|first=Jonah|title=Arctic Monkeys Start Over|date=3 May 2018|access-date=6 May 2018|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|archive-date=6 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506104411/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/arctic-monkeys-new-album-tranquility-base-hotel-interview-w519741|url-status=live}}</ref> The album was described as psychedelic pop,<ref name="Hindu">{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/an-immersive-listen/article23892028.ece |title=Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino album: An immersive listen |last=Tagat |first=Anurag |date=15 May 2018 |website=[[The Hindu]] |access-date=26 June 2018}}</ref><ref name="independent.ie">{{cite web |last=Hunt |first=Julia |date=17 December 2018 |title=Arctic Monkeys top Q magazine's album of the year list |url=https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/arctic-monkeys-top-q-magazines-album-of-the-year-list-37636115.html |access-date=4 December 2020 |website=[[Irish Independent]]}}</ref> [[lounge pop]],<ref name="RSReview">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/review-arctic-monkeys-tranquility-bass-hotel-w520154|title=Review: Arctic Monkeys' 'Tranquility Base Hotel' Is a Space-Lounge Odyssey|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|last=Dolan|first=Jon|date=11 May 2018|access-date=11 May 2018|archive-date=11 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511214621/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/review-arctic-monkeys-tranquility-bass-hotel-w520154|url-status=live}}</ref> [[space pop]],<ref name="Spin">{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2018/05/arctic-monkeys-tranquility-base-hotel-casino-review|title=Arctic Monkeys' Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino Is Their Strangest and Most Alluring Album|last=Fitzmaurice|first=Larry|date=11 May 2018|access-date=12 May 2018|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|archive-date=12 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180512011908/https://www.spin.com/2018/05/arctic-monkeys-tranquility-base-hotel-casino-review/|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[glam rock]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/05/ranking-every-arctic-monkeys-album-from-worst-to-best/2|title=Ranking: Every Arctic Monkeys Album from Worst to Best|last=Midkiff|first=Sarah|work=[[Consequence of Sound]]|date=14 May 2018|access-date=24 May 2018|archive-date=25 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525132916/https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/05/ranking-every-arctic-monkeys-album-from-worst-to-best/2/|url-status=live}}</ref> In a 2018 interview with BBC Radio 1, Alex Turner explained that he wrote the songs for the album on a piano instead of the guitar as "the guitar had lost its ability to give me ideas.

According to ''[[Vice Media|Vice]]'', "in Britain at least, Arctic Monkeys have reached a point where they are too enormous, too beloved a force to truly fail" and are probably the UK's biggest, most culturally important band. ''Vice'' further states that they are "the band that your friends whose music taste can otherwise be described as “''[[Match of the Day]]''-wave” are desperate to see perform live; the band dads and little brothers have in common—simply because throughout their career, they have remained consistent, while their peers in both sound and age have failed to keep similar longevity."<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=How Did Arctic Monkeys Become the Biggest Band in Britain?|url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/59qmgz/how-did-arctic-monkeys-become-the-biggest-band-in-britain|access-date=2021-07-21|website=www.vice.com|language=en}}</ref>  English poet [[John Cooper Clarke]] praised the band as "the nearest thing" to [[the Beatles]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|last=Emmett|first=Simon|date=2014-04-01|title=How The Arctic Monkeys Saved Rock 'N' Roll|url=http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/music/6017/arctic-monkeys-exclusive-photos-interview/|access-date=2021-07-24|website=Esquire|language=en-GB}}</ref> [[Radio X (United Kingdom)|Radio X]] has also named Arctic Monkeys as one of the best bands of all time.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Best Bands Of All Time|url=https://www.radiox.co.uk/features/x-lists/best-bands-of-all-time/|access-date=2021-07-21|website=Radio X|language=en}}</ref>

Following the success of ''Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not'', some critics cited the Arctic Monkeys as revolutionising the way people find music as they built a fanbase on the basis of a few demos shared by fans through the internet.<ref>{{cite news|last=Barton|first=Laura|date=25 October 2005|title=The question: Have the Arctic Monkeys changed the music business?|work=The Guardian|location=London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/oct/25/popandrock.arcticmonkeys|url-status=live|access-date=18 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308150400/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/oct/25/popandrock.arcticmonkeys|archive-date=8 March 2017}}</ref> Critics hugely praised the album for its depiction of youth [[British Culture]] and for resurging [[Indie music scene#United Kingdom|British indie music]] that had waned after the 1990s,<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Spotlight Special: Arctic Monkeys - Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not|url=https://www.clashmusic.com/features/spotlight-special-arctic-monkeys-whatever-people-say-i-am-thats-what-im-not|access-date=15 April 2021|website=Clash Magazine|language=en}}</ref> with ''NME'' declaring the Arctic Monkeys "Our Generation's Most Important Band".<ref name=":2" />

But so do grandads who were into [[Led Zeppelin]].
