'''Oh Wonder''' are an English, [[London]]-based alt-pop duo consisting of Anthony Vander West and Josephine Vander West. Since releasing their debut album, they have seen international success with their alt-pop singles. Oh Wonder recorded and released one song a month for a year, starting in September 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Donelson|first1=Marcy|title=Oh Wonder &#124; Biography & History &#124; AllMusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/oh-wonder-mn0003385218/biography|website=AllMusic|access-date=27 August 2016}}</ref> All of the songs were released together as a [[Oh Wonder (album)|self-titled debut album]] on 4 September 2015.<ref name="Interview with Interview Magazine">{{cite web|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/discovery-oh-wonder-1#_|title=Discovery: Oh Wonder|last=Ryang|first=James|date=3 September 2015|publisher=Interview Magazine |access-date=6 September 2015}}</ref> On 14 July 2017, the duo released their second album, ''[[Ultralife (album)|Ultralife]]''.

All four albums were written, recorded, produced, and mixed by the duo and have seen cross-platform success.

The band played sold-out shows in London, Paris, New York, and Los Angeles one week after their debut album release, which marked the beginning of their touring career. They have since played multiple headline shows and festivals in numerous countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BmO68L-nCg6/|title=Oh Wonder on Instagram: "Last show done ☑️ high fives and endless love to everyone that made it to one of the 318 shows that we've played across 45 countries.…"|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=7 October 2018}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation and early years===
Before Oh Wonder was formed, Vander Gucht was a solo artist, first going by her own name and later under the alias LAYLA. Anthony West was originally part of the groups Tonight Is Goodbye, Futures, and We the Wild.<ref name="Cal Times">{{cite web|last1=Hixon|first1=Shalene|title=Band Spotlight: Oh Wonder|url=https://www.caltimes.org/3925/entertainment/band-spotlight-oh-wonder/|website=Cal Times|access-date=10 January 2018}}</ref> The two first met in [[High Wycombe]] on 21 March 2010, when West was in the audience at one of Vander Gucht's solo gigs. A year later, Vander Gucht attended one of West's gigs, talked with him, and they began writing songs and making music together.

The duo released their first two songs under the name Wonder Wonder but changed it to Oh Wonder when they learned of another band with a similar name.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wonderlandmagazine.com/2015/03/03/new-noise-oh-wonder/|title=New Noise: Oh Wonder {{!}} Wonderland Magazine|date=3 March 2015|work=Wonderland|access-date=6 July 2018}}</ref>

===2014–2016: ''Oh Wonder''===
