'''Graveyard''' is a Swedish [[hard rock]] band from [[Gothenburg]], formed in 2006.

==History==
[[File:Graveyard - Rock am Ring 2019-4273.jpg|thumb|Graveyard live at [[Rock am Ring]] 2019]]
Joakim Nilsson, Rikard Edlund (both formerly of Norrsken), Axel Sjöberg, and Truls Mörck formed Graveyard in 2006. When Norrsken disbanded in 2000, guitarist Magnus Pelander went on to form doomy folk metal act [[Witchcraft (band)|Witchcraft]] and Nilsson and Edlund joined Albatross, a growly blues rock band whose lineup also included Sjöberg on drums. Initially, they considered Albatross a hobby project, but after five years the members began taking their music more seriously and had grown dissatisfied with the direction their sound had taken. When Albatross broke up, Nilsson and Edlund decided that for their next venture, they would head back towards their roots as musicians and songwriters. Nilsson explains, “I am a singer, but in Albatross I only played guitar. Rikard played guitar but he is a bass player. We also wanted a more straightforward [rock] sound.”<ref>{{citation | title = Graveyard: The Sweet Sounds of Swedish Psych | url = http://www.alarmpress.com/2844/music-interview/graveyard-the-new-sound-of-swedish-rock/ | publisher = Alarm | date = 9 June 2008 | access-date = 28 June 2009 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081013110159/http://www.alarmpress.com/2844/music-interview/graveyard-the-new-sound-of-swedish-rock/ | archive-date = 13 October 2008}}</ref>

Together with Sjöberg and guitarist/singer Truls Mörck (not to be confused with [[Truls Mørk]]) they began practicing as Graveyard. Upon their initial formation, Graveyard quickly recorded a two track demo, played a total of three shows, and began planning for a full-length album with Swedish label Transubstans Records. In the meantime, they posted a demo of some of their material on Myspace. Songs from the band's Myspace caught the ear of Tony Presedo, founder of [[Tee Pee Records]]. Their self-titled debut album was recorded by Don Ahlsterberg and released in early 2008. On the recording sessions' completion, Truls Mörck was replaced by guitarist Jonatan Ramm. The debut album received generally good reviews.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eduardo Rivadavia |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/graveyard-mw0000492840 |title=Graveyard - Graveyard &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=18 September 2007 |access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref> Graveyard performed at the 2008's [[South by Southwest Music Festival]].<ref>[http://2008.sxsw.com/music/showcases/band/69823.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109044454/http://2008.sxsw.com/music/showcases/band/69823.html |date=9 January 2009}}</ref>
