'''REO Speedwagon''' (originally stylized as '''R.E.O. Speedwagon''') is an American [[Rock music|rock]] [[Band (rock and pop)|band]] from [[Champaign, Illinois]]. Formed in 1967, the band cultivated a following during the 1970s and achieved significant commercial success throughout the 1980s. The group's best-selling album, ''[[Hi Infidelity]]'' (1980), contained four US Top 40 hits and sold more than 10 million copies.

Over the course of their career, the band has sold more than 40 million records and has charted 13 Top 40 hits, including the number ones "[[Keep On Loving You (song)|Keep On Loving You]]" and "[[Can't Fight This Feeling]]". REO Speedwagon's mainstream popularity waned in the late 1980s, but the band remains a popular live act.

==History==
===Formation===
[[File:REO half ton Speedwagon.jpeg|thumb|250px|Advertisement for a Reo Speed Wagon]] 
In the autumn of 1966, [[Neal Doughty]] entered the electrical engineering program at the [[University of Illinois]] in [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]], [[Illinois]], as a junior. On his first night, he met fellow student Alan Gratzer. They held an impromptu jam session in the basement of their [[UIUC Residence Halls|Illinois Street Residence]] Hall dormitory<ref name="mtv.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/reo_speedwagon/artist.jhtml#bio |title=REO Speedwagon &#124; New Music And Songs |website=Mtv.com|access-date=February 1, 2014}}</ref><ref name=NG2017>{{cite news|url=http://www.news-gazette.com/section/answerbook/famous-residents-former-residents.html |title=Famous residents, former residents |newspaper=[[Champaign News-Gazette]] |date=January 15, 2017 |access-date=January 15, 2017}}</ref> and soon started a rock band. Gratzer had been a drummer since high school, and was playing in a local group on the weekends, while Doughty had learned some [[The Beatles|Beatles]] songs on his parents' piano.

Doughty began to follow Gratzer's band, eventually sitting in on a song or two. The keyboard player was the leader, but several other band members were unhappy with the situation. On the last day of the university's spring semester, guitarist Joe Matt called the band's leader and told him that he, drummer Gratzer, and bassist Mike Blair had decided to leave the band to start a new one with Doughty.

They made a list of songs to learn over the summer break, and Doughty landed a summer job to buy his first keyboard. On his [[Farfisa]] organ, he learned "[[Light My Fire]]" by [[The Doors]]. The members returned to school in the fall of 1967 and had their first rehearsal before classes started. They named the band REO Speedwagon, from the [[REO Speed Wagon]], a 1915 truck that was designed by [[Ransom E. Olds|Ransom Eli Olds]].<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=1006}}</ref>  Doughty had seen the name written across the blackboard when he walked into his History of Transportation class on the first day they had decided to look for a name. Rather than pronouncing REO as a single word as the motor company did {{nobreak|("''REE-oh''")}}, they chose to spell the word out, pronouncing each letter individually ("R-E-O"). An advertisement in the school newspaper produced their first job, a fraternity party that turned into a food fight. They continued to perform [[cover songs]] in campus bars, fraternity parties, and university events. The first lineup consisted of Doughty on keyboards, Gratzer on drums and vocals, Joe Matt on guitar and vocals, Mike Blair on bass and vocals.

In early 1968, [[Terry Luttrell]] became lead singer, and Bob Crownover joined as the guitar player, replacing Matt.  When Mike Blair left the band in mid-1968, Gregg Philbin replaced Blair, Marty Shepard played trumpet and Joe McCabe played sax until McCabe moved to [[Southern Illinois University]]. Crownover played guitar for the group until mid-1969 when [[Bill Fiorio]] replaced him. Fiorio then departed in late 1969, eventually assuming the name [[Duke Tumatoe]], and went on to form the All Star Frogs. Steve Scorfina (who would go on to found [[progressive rock]]/[[album-oriented rock]] band [[Pavlov's Dog (band)|Pavlov's Dog]]) came aboard for over a year, composing with the band and performing live, before being replaced by [[Gary Richrath]] in late 1970.

Richrath was a [[Peoria, Illinois]]-based guitarist and prolific [[songwriter]] who brought fresh original material to the band. Richrath had driven 100 miles (160&nbsp;km) to see the band and become a part of it.  He is quoted as saying "I'm going to be a part of that band whether they like it or not", and then went about making it happen.  With Richrath on board, the regional popularity of the band grew tremendously. The Midwestern United States was the original REO Speedwagon fan stronghold and is pivotal in this period of the band's history. They gained a major supporter in the [[St. Louis, Missouri]]-based radio station [[KSHE]], whose status as one of America's most influential rock stations boosted their platform beyond the Midwest.

The band signed to [[Epic Records]] in 1971.<ref name="Larkin"/> [[Paul Leka]], an [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] record producer, brought the band to his [[recording studio]] in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[Connecticut]] where it recorded original material for its first album. The lineup on the first album consisted of Richrath, Gratzer, Doughty, Philbin, and Luttrell.<ref name="Larkin"/>

===Early  years===
With their equipment being hauled to dates in a friend's station wagon, REO played bars and clubs all over the Midwest. The band's debut album, ''[[R.E.O. Speedwagon (album)|R.E.O. Speedwagon]]'', was released on [[Epic Records]] in 1971.<ref name="Larkin"/> The most popular track on this record was "[[157 Riverside Avenue]]". The title refers to the [[Westport, Connecticut]] address, where the band stayed while recording in Leka's studio in Bridgeport and remains an in-concert favorite.

Although the rest of the band's lineup remained stable, REO Speedwagon switched lead vocalists three times for their first three albums. Luttrell left the band in early 1972, eventually becoming the vocalist for [[Starcastle]]. He was replaced by [[Kevin Cronin]].<ref name="Larkin"/> Cronin recorded one album with the band, 1972's ''[[R.E.O./T.W.O.]]'' but left the band during the recording sessions for 1973's ''[[Ridin' the Storm Out]]'' because of internal conflicts.<ref>{{cite news| work= [[People (magazine)|People]]  |title= Now It's Cheat to the Beat, as Reo Speedwagon Finally Arrives with 'Hi Infidelity' |first= David |last= Sheff |date= March 23, 1981 |volume= 15| number= 11| url= http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20078872,00.html | access-date=August 19, 2010}}</ref> ''Ridin' the Storm Out'' was completed with Michael Bryan Murphy on lead vocal, and it featured Neal Doughty's "wailing storm siren" synthesizer intro on the title track. Murphy stayed on for two more albums, ''[[Lost in a Dream (REO Speedwagon album)|Lost in a Dream]]'' and ''[[This Time We Mean It]]'', before Cronin returned to the fold in January 1976 and recorded ''[[R.E.O. (album)|R.E.O.]]'', which was released that same year.<ref name="Larkin"/>

Cronin's return came after [[Greg X. Volz]] turned down the position for lead vocalist after becoming a  Christian.

In 1977, REO convinced Epic Records that their strength was in their live performances. Epic agreed to let them produce their first live album, ''[[Live: You Get What You Play For]]'', which was eventually [[RIAA certification|certified platinum]].<ref name="Larkin"/> That same year, the band moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].

In 1977, bassist Gregg Philbin left the band.<ref name="Larkin"/> Depending upon which band member is expressing an opinion, it was either because Philbin was disenchanted with the new corporate-structure REO where Cronin and Richrath got bigger slices of the pie instead of the equal credit they once shared as a "garage band", or he was asked to leave over his lifestyle issues affecting the music quality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/REO-Speedwagon-2571/Gregg-Philbin.htm |title=REO Speedwagon |website=En.allexperts.com |access-date=January 15, 2017}}</ref> Philbin was replaced with another Champaign, Illinois musician, [[Centennial High School (Champaign, Illinois)|Centennial High School]] alumnus, [[Bruce Hall (musician)|Bruce Hall]],<ref name=NG2017 /> to record ''[[You Can Tune a Piano but You Can't Tuna Fish]]''.<ref name="Larkin"/> The album was released in 1978 and has received [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio airplay over the years, thanks to songs like "Roll with the Changes" and "[[Time for Me to Fly (song)|Time for Me to Fly]]". The album was REO's first to make the Top 40, peaking at No. 29. The album sold over two million copies in the US, ultimately achieving [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] status.

In 1979, the band took a turn back to hard rock with the release of ''[[Nine Lives (REO Speedwagon album)|Nine Lives]]''.<ref name="Larkin"/>

===Mainstream success===
On November 21, 1980, Epic released ''[[Hi Infidelity]]'',<ref name="Larkin"/> which represented a change in sound, going from [[hard rock]] to more [[Pop music|pop]]-oriented material.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> ''Hi Infidelity'' spawned four hit singles written by Richrath and Cronin, including the chart-topping "[[Keep On Loving You (song)|Keep On Loving You]]" (Cronin),<ref name="Larkin"/> plus "[[Take It on the Run]]" (#5) (Richrath), "[[In Your Letter]]" (#20) (Richrath), and "[[Don't Let Him Go]]" (#24) (Cronin), and remained on the charts for 65 weeks, 32 of which were spent in the top ten, including 15 weeks atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. ''Hi Infidelity'' sold over 10 million copies.

The band's follow-up album, ''[[Good Trouble]]'', was released in June 1982.<ref name="Larkin"/> Although it was not as successful as its predecessor, the album performed moderately well commercially, featuring the hit singles "[[Keep the Fire Burnin' (REO Speedwagon song)|Keep the Fire Burnin']]" (U.S. #7), "Sweet Time" (U.S. #26) and the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Album Rock chart]] hit "The Key."

Two years later, the band released ''[[Wheels Are Turnin']]'', an album that included the #1 hit single "[[Can't Fight This Feeling]]" plus three more hits: "[[I Do' Wanna Know]]" (U.S. #29), "[[One Lonely Night (song)|One Lonely Night]]" (U.S. #19), and "Live Every Moment" (U.S. #34).<ref name="Larkin"/>

REO Speedwagon toured the US in 1985, including a sold-out concert in Madison, Wisconsin in May.<ref name="Inc.1985">{{cite book|title=Box Score Top Grossing Concerts|work=Billboard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4yQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT48|date=June 1, 1985 |publisher=|pages=48â€“|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> On July 13, on the way to a show in Milwaukee, the band made a stop in Philadelphia to play at the US leg of [[Live Aid]], which broke a record for number of viewers. They performed "Can't Fight This Feeling" and "Roll With the Changes," which featured members of [[the Beach Boys]], the band members' families, and [[Paul Shaffer]] on stage for backing vocals.

1987's ''[[Life as We Know It (REO Speedwagon album)|Life as We Know It]]'' saw a decline in sales,<ref name="Larkin"/> but still managed to provide the band with the top-20 hits "That Ain't Love" (U.S. #16) and "[[In My Dreams (REO Speedwagon song)|In My Dreams]]" (U.S. #19).<ref>{{cite magazine | url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=reo speedwagon|chart=all}} | title=Artist Chart History - REO Speedwagon|magazine=Billboard | access-date=May 9, 2009}}</ref> ''[[The Hits (REO Speedwagon album)|The Hits]]'' (1988) is a compilation album from REO Speedwagon.<ref name="Larkin"/> It contains the new tracks "I Don't Want to Lose You" and "Here With Me." They were the last songs recorded with Gary Richrath and Alan Gratzer. "Here with Me" cracked the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the top ten on the Adult Contemporary chart.

===Changes in the 1990s===
By the late 1980s, the band's popularity was starting to decline.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Original drummer Alan Gratzer left in September 1988 after he decided to retire from music to open a restaurant. In early 1989, Gary Richrath was fired after tensions between him and Kevin Cronin boiled over.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/6700404/reo-speedwagon-gary-richrath-kevin-cronin-interview|title=REO Speedwagon Will Dedicate Every Show to Late Guitarist Gary Richrath 'Probably Forever'|website=Billboard|access-date=October 3, 2019}}</ref> Cronin had been playing in The Strolling Dudes, a jazz ensemble that included jazz trumpet player [[Rick Braun]] (who had co-written the abovementioned "Here With Me" with Cronin), Miles Joseph on lead guitar and [[Graham Lear]] on drums. Lear had already been invited to join REO in September 1988 as Gratzer's successor and Joseph was brought in as a temporary stand-in for Richrath. Back up singers Carla Day and Melanie Jackson were also added. This lineup did only one show, on January 7, 1989, in [[ViÃ±a del Mar]], [[Chile]], where it won the award for best group at the city's annual International Song Festival. After that, Miles Joseph and the back up singers were dropped in favor of former [[Ted Nugent]] guitarist [[Dave Amato]] (who was brought aboard in May 1989) and keyboardist/songwriter/producer [[Jesse Harms]].

The 1990 release ''[[The Earth, a Small Man, His Dog and a Chicken]]'', with [[Bryan Hitt]] (formerly of [[Wang Chung (band)|Wang Chung]]) on drums, was a commercial disappointment.<ref name="Larkin"/> The album produced only one, and - to date - the band's last [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] single, "[[Love Is a Rock]]," which peaked at No. 65. Harms, disenchanted by the album's failure, left the group in early 1991.

Shortly after his departure, Richrath assembled former members of the Midwestern band Vancouver to form a namesake band, Richrath. After touring for several years, the Richrath band released ''Only the Strong Survive'' in 1992 on the [[GNP Crescendo Record Co.|GNP Crescendo]] label. Richrath (the band) continued to perform for several years before disbanding in the late 1990s. In September 1998, Gary Richrath briefly joined REO onstage at the County Fair in Los Angeles to play on the band's encore song, "157 Riverside Avenue". He then joined REO once again in Los Angeles in May 2000 for the same encore but no serious plans for a reunion ever materialized.

Having lost their recording contract with Epic, REO Speedwagon ended up releasing ''[[Building the Bridge]]'' (1996) on the Priority/Rhythm Safari label. When that label went [[bankrupt]], the album was released on [[Sanctuary Records|Castle Records]], which also experienced financial troubles. REO Speedwagon ultimately self-financed this effort, which failed to chart. The title track did make R&R's AC Top 30 chart.

===Revival of the hits===
The commercial failure of the band's newer material with its revised lineup demanded a change in marketing strategy. As a consequence, Epic began re-releasing recordings from older albums with updated artwork and design.

Since 1995, the label has released over a dozen compilation albums featuring greatest hits, including 1999's ''[[The Ballads (REO Speedwagon album)|The Ballads]]'' which featured two new songs Just for You (Cronin and Jim Peterik) and Till The River's Run Dry (Cronin). In 2000, REO teamed up with [[Styx (band)|Styx]] for an appearance at [[Riverport Amphitheater]] in [[St. Louis]], which was released as a live concert video ''[[Arch Allies: Live at Riverport]]''. The REO portion of the show was released again under three separate titles: ''Live - Plus'' (2001), ''Live Plus 3'' (2001) and ''Extended Versions'' (2001) (which was [[RIAA certification|certified gold]] by the RIAA on April 26, 2006). REO once again teamed with Styx in 2003 for the Classic Rock's Main Event tour which also included another band from their common rock era, [[Journey (band)|Journey]].

===2000â€“present===
The band released a self-financed album entitled ''[[Find Your Own Way Home]]'' in April 2007. Though it did not chart as an album, it produced two singles I Needed to Fall (Cronin) and Find Your Own Way Home (Cronin) which appeared on [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'']]'s [[Adult contemporary music|Adult Contemporary]] radio chart.

REO Speedwagon continues to tour regularly, performing mostly their classic hits.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.louisville.com/content/reo-speedwagons-kevin-cronin-louisville-power-ballads-and-if-my-wifes-slut | title=REO Speedwagon's Kevin Cronin on Louisville, power ballads and if my wife's a slut|website=Louisville.com | access-date=February 24, 2010}}</ref> They teamed up with [[Styx (band)|Styx]] to record a new single entitled "Can't Stop Rockin'", released in March 2009, as well as for a full tour that included special guest [[38 Special (band)|.38 Special]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/269330/styx-reo-speedwagon-team-up-for-rockin-tour-single | title=Styx, REO Speedwagon Team Up For "Rockin'" Tour, Single | work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]  |access-date=April 29, 2009}}</ref>

In November 2009, REO Speedwagon released a Christmas album, ''[[Not So Silent Night...Christmas with REO Speedwagon]].''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=100890339&blogId=509425779 |title=Myspace |website=Blogs.myspace.com |access-date=February 1, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120707183639/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=100890339&blogId=509425779 |archive-date=July 7, 2012  }}</ref> On December 2, the band released an online [[video game]], ''Find Your Own Way Home'', produced by digital design agency Curious Sense. The game was the first "downloadable [[casual game]]" produced with a rock band and was cited by numerous publications including ''[[The New York Times]]'' as an innovative marketing product for a music act.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/02/business/media/02adco.html | title=REO Speedwagon Rocks On as a Game | access-date=December 2, 2009 | work=The New York Times | first=Stuart | last=Elliott | date=December 2, 2009}}</ref> In mid-2010, the band â€” then touring with [[Pat Benatar]] â€” announced that it would release a 30th anniversary deluxe edition reissue of ''Hi Infidelity''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/957160/reo-speedwagon-plans-hi-infidelty-30th-anniversary-reissue-tour |title=REO Speedwagon Plans 'Hi Infidelty' 30th Anniversary Reissue, Tour |magazine=Billboard |access-date=February 1, 2014}}</ref>

REO Speedwagon headlined on the M&I Classic Rock Stage at the Milwaukee Summerfest on June 30, 2011. On March 11, 2012, Kevin Cronin appeared on the [[Canada|Canadian]] reality TV series ''[[Star AcadÃ©mie]]''. He sang a sampling of REO's hits with the show's singing finalists.

On November 22, 2013, they announced a benefit concert with Styx titled "Rock to the Rescue" to raise money for the affected families of the [[Tornado outbreak of November 17, 2013|tornadoes in central Illinois]].  The concert was held on December 4, 2013, in [[Bloomington, Illinois]]. [[Richard Marx]] joined REO on stage for a joint performance of two of his hit songs.  Gary Richrath reunited with REO one final time for a performance of "Ridin' the Storm Out" to end REO's set at the sold-out concert.  Richrath stayed on stage to help with the encore of "[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]" along with REO, Styx, Richard Marx, and others.  Richrath was originally from the town of East Peoria which was damaged during the storm.  Families impacted by the storm and first responders sat near the stage for this special REO concert.

In early 2014, it was announced that REO Speedwagon and [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] would be teaming up for 15 dates throughout 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/125812/live-nation-announces-reo-speedwagon-and-chicago-s |title=Live Nation Announces REO Speedwagon And Chicago Summer Tour |website=AllAccess.com |date=January 13, 2014 |access-date=February 1, 2014}}</ref> Gary Richrath died on September 13, 2015, due to complications from surgery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.music-news.com/ShowNews.asp?nItemID=92204|title=Gary Richrath of REO Speedwagon dies|date=September 14, 2015|website=Music-News.com|access-date=November 2, 2015}}</ref> In 2016 the band went on tour with Def Leppard and [[Tesla (band)|Tesla]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/def-leppard-summer-tour-2016/|title=Def Leppard Announce Summer Tour With REO Speedwagon and Tesla |website=Ultimateclassicrock.com |date=February 29, 2016|access-date=July 8, 2017}}</ref>
