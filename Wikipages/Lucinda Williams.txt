Williams' commercial breakthrough came in 1998 with ''[[Car Wheels on a Gravel Road]]'', an album presenting a broader scope of songs that fused rock, blues, country and [[Americana music|Americana]] into a distinctive style that remained consistent and commercial in sound. ''Car Wheels on a Gravel Road'', which includes the singles "Right in Time" and the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Grammy nominated]] "Can't Let Go", became Williams' greatest commercial success to date. The album was certified [[Music recording certification#Certification thresholds|Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] the following year, and earned her a [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]], while being universally acclaimed by critics. Williams' follow up album, ''[[Essence (Lucinda Williams album)|Essence]]'', appeared three years later in 2001, to further critical acclaim and commercial success, becoming her first Top 40 album on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], peaking at No. 28. Featuring a more downbeat musical tone, with spare, intimate arrangements, the album earned Williams three Grammy nominations in 2002, including Best Contemporary Folk Album, while the single "Get Right with God" won her the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1845783.stm "Grammys 2002: The winners"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023073633/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1845783.stm |date=2013-10-23 }}.

==Early life==
Williams was born in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]], the daughter of poet and literature professor [[Miller Williams]], and amateur pianist Lucille Fern Day. Her parents divorced in the mid-1960s. Williams' father gained custody of her and her younger brother, Robert Miller, and sister, Karyn Elizabeth. Like her father, Williams has [[spina bifida]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/magazine/01wwln-domains-t.html?_r=0/|title=Domains : Lucinda Williams : Country House|author=Lewine, Edward|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=24 April 2014|archive-date=27 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227160518/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/magazine/01wwln-domains-t.html?_r=0%2F|url-status=live}}</ref> Her father worked as a visiting professor in Mexico and different parts of the United States, including [[Baton Rouge]]; [[New Orleans]]; [[Jackson, Mississippi]]; and [[Utah]] before settling at the [[University of Arkansas]] in [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]]. Williams never graduated from high school but was accepted into the University of Arkansas.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Buford|first1=Bill|title=Delta Nights: A Singer's Love Affair with Loss|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2000/06/05/delta-nights|access-date=22 July 2014|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=5 June 2000|archive-date=25 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725192211/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2000/06/05/delta-nights|url-status=live}}</ref> Williams started writing when she was 6 years old. She  showed an affinity for music at an early age, and was playing guitar at 12. Her first live performance was in Mexico City at 17, as part of a duo with her friend, banjo player Clark Jones.<ref>Bukowski, Elizabeth.

==Early career==
By her early 20s, Williams was playing publicly in [[Austin]] and [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]], concentrating on a blend of [[Folk music|folk]], [[Rock music|rock]], and [[Country music|country]]. She moved to [[Jackson, Mississippi]], in 1978 to record her first album for [[Folkways Records]]. Released in 1979, and titled ''[[Ramblin' on My Mind (Lucinda Williams album)|Ramblin' on My Mind]]'', it was a collection of country and [[blues]] covers. [[Smithsonian Folkways]] provides a description: "The first recordings from an artist with a gift for interpreting original blues from [[Robert Johnson]] to [[Memphis Minnie]] to the [[Carter Family]]. Williams' unmistakable sound is powerfully direct and filled with melancholy and passion."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://folkways.si.edu/lucinda-williams/ramblin/american-folk-country/music/album/smithsonian|title=Ramblin' on My Mind – Lucinda Williams|website=[[Smithsonian Folkways]]|access-date=February 13, 2018|archive-date=January 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180109205755/https://folkways.si.edu/lucinda-williams/ramblin/american-folk-country/music/album/smithsonian|url-status=live}}</ref> When the album was re-issued in 1991, the title was shortened to ''Ramblin'''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wolff|first=Kurt|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/ramblin-mw0000274511|title=Ramblin'|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=August 10, 2005|archive-date=June 10, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610072313/http://www.allmusic.com/album/ramblin-mw0000274511|url-status=live}}</ref>

Williams' second album, ''[[Happy Woman Blues]]'', appeared the following year, and consisted of her own material. ''[[Trouser Press]]'' felt the record was more "rock-oriented" than Williams' debut album, writing that she used timeworn ideas such as "smoke-stained bars, open roads and a heart that never learns" but reimagined them "in a way that is both contemporary and uncynical".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=lucinda_williams|title=Lucinda Williams|work=Trouser Press|access-date=September 3, 2015|archive-date=October 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012194743/http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=lucinda_williams|url-status=live}}</ref> One album track, "I Lost It", was re-recorded 18 years later for Williams' fifth album ''[[Car Wheels on a Gravel Road]]'' (1998). In the 1980s, Williams moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] (before finally settling in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]), where, at times backed by a rock band and at others performing in acoustic settings, she developed a following and a critical reputation. While based in Los Angeles, she was briefly married to [[The Long Ryders|Long Ryders]] drummer [[Greg Sowders]], whom she had met in a club.<ref name=nytimes>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/14/magazine/lucinda-williams-is-in-pain.html|last=Frey|first=Darcy|title=Lucinda Williams is in pain|website=The New York Times|date=September 14, 1997|access-date=May 26, 2020|archive-date=June 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200603195229/https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/14/magazine/lucinda-williams-is-in-pain.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Success==
===Critical acclaim===
In 1988, Williams released her third album, ''[[Lucinda Williams (album)|Lucinda Williams]]'', on [[Rough Trade Records]]. Produced by Williams, along with [[Gurf Morlix]], and [[Dusty Wakeman]], the album was met with widespread critical acclaim and was voted the 16th best album of the year in ''The Village Voice''{{'}}s annual [[Pazz & Jop]] critics poll.<ref>{{cite news|date=February 28, 1989|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres88.php|title=The 1988 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|location=New York|access-date=March 30, 2015|archive-date=December 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224162931/http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres88.php|url-status=live}}</ref> It has since been viewed as a leading work in the development of the [[Americana (music)|Americana]] movement. In 2014, [[Robin Denselow]] called it "an Americana classic" in ''[[The Guardian]]'',<ref>{{cite news|last=Denselow|first=Robin|date=January 16, 2014|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/16/lucinda-williams-25th-anniversary-review|title=Lucinda Williams: Lucinda Williams 25th Anniversary Edition – review|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|access-date=March 29, 2015|archive-date=December 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201228205047/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/16/lucinda-williams-25th-anniversary-review|url-status=live}}</ref> while Stephen M.

''Lucinda Williams'' also features "[[The Night's Too Long]]", later recorded by [[Patty Loveless]] in 1990 for her album ''[[On Down the Line (album)|On Down the Line]]'', and "[[Passionate Kisses]]", later recorded by [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]] for her album ''[[Come On Come On]]'' (1992). Adhering closely in tempo, feel, and instrumentation to Williams' original recording, "Passionate Kisses" became a major hit for Carpenter, enhancing her crossover appeal and earning her the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance]] in [[36th Annual Grammy Awards|1994]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/mary-chapin-carpenter/8684|title=Artist: Mary Chapin Carpenter|website=www.grammy.com|publisher=Recording Academy|access-date=26 October 2021|archive-date=26 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211026163108/https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/mary-chapin-carpenter/8684|url-status=live}}</ref> while it earned Williams the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song]].<ref name="grammy"/>

Also produced alongside Morlix and Wakeman, ''Sweet Old World'' is a melancholy album dealing with themes of suicide and death. The album received mass critical acclaim, with [[Robert Christgau]] ranking it 6th on his year-end list,<ref>{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|date=March 2, 1993|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/deans92.php|title=Pazz & Jop 1992: Dean's List|newspaper=The Village Voice|location=New York|access-date=August 3, 2015|archive-date=October 9, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211009214125/http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/deans92.php|url-status=live}}</ref> later writing that the album was "gorgeous, flawless, brilliant [with] short-story details ('chess pieces,' 'dresses that zip up the side') packing a textural thrill akin to [[wikt:local color|local color]]".<ref>{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|issue=June 12|year=2001|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/rock/lucinda-01.php|title=Encore From a Utopia|newspaper=The Village Voice|location=New York|access-date=August 3, 2015|archive-date=October 9, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211009214123/http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/rock/lucinda-01.php|url-status=live}}</ref> [[AllMusic]]'s Steve Huey said it was just as good as her 1988 self-titled album, calling it "a gorgeous, elegiac record that not only consolidates but expands Williams' ample talents."<ref>{{cite web|last=Huey|first=Steve|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/sweet-old-world-mw0000082196|title=Sweet Old World - Lucinda Williams|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=August 10, 2005|archive-date=June 10, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610063419/http://www.allmusic.com/album/sweet-old-world-mw0000082196|url-status=live}}</ref> The track "Something About What Happens When We Talk" was later featured in the [[Cheryl Strayed]] biographical adventure film ''[[Wild (2014 film)|Wild]]'' (2014), starring [[Reese Witherspoon]] and [[Laura Dern]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Monger|first=Timothy|title=Wild [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/wild-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-mw0002759106|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=Oct 24, 2021|archive-date=October 25, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211025160612/https://www.allmusic.com/album/wild-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-mw0002759106|url-status=live}}</ref>

During this period, Williams' biggest commercial successes remained as a songwriter. [[Emmylou Harris]] said of Williams, "She is an example of the best of what country at least says it is, but, for some reason, she's completely out of the loop and I feel strongly that that's country music's loss." Harris later recorded the title track from ''Sweet Old World'' for her career-redefining 1995 album, ''[[Wrecking Ball (Emmylou Harris album)|Wrecking Ball]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|title=''Wrecking Ball'' – Emmylou Harris|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/wrecking-ball-mw0000176103|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=May 11, 2020|archive-date=May 24, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200524141547/https://www.allmusic.com/album/wrecking-ball-mw0000176103|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1996, Williams duetted with [[Steve Earle]] on the song "You're Still Standin' There" from his album ''[[I Feel Alright]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Deming|first=Mark|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/i-feel-alright-mw0000181122|title=I Feel Alright - Steve Earle|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=August 10, 2005|archive-date=October 23, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023083707/http://www.allmusic.com/album/i-feel-alright-mw0000181122|url-status=live}}</ref> Williams also gained a reputation as a perfectionist and slow worker when it came to recording; six years would pass before her next album release, though she appeared as a guest on other artists' albums and contributed to several tribute compilations during this period.

===Commercial breakthrough===
The long-awaited release, 1998's ''[[Car Wheels on a Gravel Road]]'', was Williams' breakthrough into the mainstream.

==2000s==
Williams followed up the success of ''Car Wheels on a Gravel Road'' with ''[[Essence (Lucinda Williams album)|Essence]]'', released on June 5, 2001. Featuring a less produced, more down-tuned approach both musically and lyrically, ''Essence'' moved Williams further from the country music establishment, while winning fans in the alternative music world. The album was Grammy nominated for Best Contemporary Folk Album in 2002, while Williams won the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]] for the single "Get Right with God", an atypically up-tempo gospel-rock tune from the otherwise rather low-key release. The title track includes a contribution on a Hammond organ by [[alternative country]] musician [[Ryan Adams]], and earned Williams a nomination for the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]. At the same ceremony, Williams was nominated the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance]] for her cover of "[[Cold, Cold Heart]]", from the all-star [[Hank Williams]]  tribute album, ''Timeless: Hank Williams Tribute'' (2001).<ref>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=mw0000014218|label=''Timeless: Hank Williams Tribute'' - Various Artists|access-date=7 July 2014}}</ref> On January 13, 2002, Williams performed with [[Elvis Costello]] on the inaugural episode of ''[[CMT Crossroads]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gray|first=Michael|url=http://www.elviscostello.info/articles/a-c/cmt.011206a.html|title=Costello, Williams Tape Crossroads Session for CMT|website=The Elvis Costello Home Page|access-date=October 10, 2021|archive-date=October 10, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211010171037/http://www.elviscostello.info/articles/a-c/cmt.011206a.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Later that year, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine christened Williams "America's best songwriter".<ref name=time/>

Her seventh album, ''[[World Without Tears]]'', was released on April 8, 2003. A musically adventurous though lyrically downbeat album, this release found Williams experimenting with talking blues stylings and electric blues. It received critical acclaim and commercial success, becoming Williams' first Top 20 album on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], peaking at No. 18.<ref name=bill200/> [[AllMusic]] called it "the bravest, most emotionally wrenching record she's ever issued".<ref>{{cite web|last=Jurek|first=Thom|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/world-without-tears-mw0000593807|title=World Without Tears – Lucinda Williams|website=AllMusic|access-date=January 21, 2017|archive-date=December 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226170050/http://www.allmusic.com/album/world-without-tears-mw0000593807|url-status=live}}</ref> ''World Without Tears'' earned Williams two Grammy nominations in 2004; Best Contemporary Folk Album, and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for the single "Righteously".

Each night's album set was recorded and made available to the attendees that night. These live recordings are currently available on her website and at her shows.

Williams wrapped recording on her ninth album in March 2008. Titled ''[[Little Honey]]'', it was released on October 14 of that year and become her first Top 10 album on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], peaking at No. 9.<ref name=bill200/> It earned Williams a Grammy nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Americana Album|Best Americana Album]] in 2010 (the first year to feature this category).
