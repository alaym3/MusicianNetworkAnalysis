In 2006, the group released its first single on [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan]]'s [[Epic Records]] label. Several of their albums have reached number one on the Oricon weekly rankings, and their songs have been featured on various media: from TV commercials, anime shows such as ''[[Naruto#Naruto: Shippuden|Naruto Shippuden]]'', Japanese TV Dramas such as {{Nihongo|''Women Won't Allow This''|「女はそれを許さない」| "Onna wa Sore o Yurusanai"}}, live action movies such as {{Nihongo|''Time Traveler: The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (2010)''|『映画：時をかける少女』　（2010年）| "Eiga: Toki o Kakeru Shōjo (2010)"}}, the 2012 Olympic broadcast theme song for [[NHK]], and the set piece for a national junior high music competition.

Their official fan club is named {{Nihongo|''Ikimonogakari Fan Class 1-2''|いきものがかりファンクラス1年2組|, "Ikimonogakari Fan Kurasu 1-nen 2-kumi"}}<ref name="ikimonogakarijp">いきものがかり. a) as stated in the Japanese wiki. b) All support members listed on the band's Japanese wiki. [[:ja:いきものがかり|いきものがかり]]</ref>

Mizuno has the most composed songs among them, while Yamashita ranks second. Yoshioka has contributed lyrics to a few songs, but ''Namida ga Kieru Nara'' is the only song on which the three of them have collaborated.<ref>Mizuno Yoshiki (@mizunoyoshiki) on Twitter.

In June 2021, it was announced that Hotaka Yamashita was leaving the band which would continue as a duo.<ref name="Yamashita" />

==History==

===Formation and trials, 1999-2003===
In 1989, Mizuno and Yamashita met by chance while they were in the first grade; they were both put in charge of being {{Nihongo|''Ikimonogakari''|いきものがかり}}, who are caretakers of the school's plants and animals.<ref name="sonyindex"/> Yamashita later noted that he really wanted to be a "blackboard monitor".  Yamashita and Mizuno formed their band on February 1, 1999, and began performing live on the street; not taking it too seriously, they named it "ikimono-gakari" after their shared experience in first grade. At first, they did covers of [[Masayoshi Yamazaki]].  In November 3, 1999, Yoshioka joined the band.<ref name="profile"/> In those days, Mizuno and Yamashita planned to make a group with a female lead vocalist, which would be an unusual sound for the street performances they were doing. Yoshioka was the younger sister of one of their classmates; she entered as the main singer and the band took on its present-day form. As they were then performing with three members, the band did a cover of [[Yuzu (band)|Yuzu's]] single, {{Nihongo|"Natsuiro"|夏色|"The Colors of Summer"}}.<ref name=sakusaku>"Sakusaku", a music variety show on [[television Kanagawa|tvk]]</ref>

In September 2000, they suspended the band to focus on college entrance examinations for Yamashita and Mizuno.  By March 2003, Yoshioka recovered from a slump where she had almost thought of not singing anymore; she saw this as a second chance to grow as a person. Again, the band re-formed, but then, they were performing with the intent of supporting their increasing fame.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} As their style of music was moving more towards an acoustic focus, they planned to expand their scope to cover not only street performances but live house concerts as well. Moreover, they made a greater effort to compose more original music and rely less on covers.

===Rise to fame, 2003-2008===
In April 2003, the band resumed playing with a street show in front of the [[Hon-Atsugi Station]] on the [[Odakyū Odawara Line]]. In June, they did a one-band show at the Thunder Snake Atsugi live venue for the first time. A person who happened to be attending this performance ended up becoming their manager; this became the impetus for them to launch a major road tour.<ref name=sakusaku /> On August 25, they released their first indie album, ''Makoto ni Senetsu Nagara First Album wo Koshirae Mashita...''. On March 26, 2005, the band held a show in the small hall at the Atsugi City Culture Building (Atsugishi Bunka Kaikan); this was the first time the band had ever done a single-band show in a hall.

On March 15, 2006, the band released their first single, [[Sakura (Ikimono-gakari song)|SAKURA]], produced by Masanori Shimada. This was their major label debut with Epic Records Japan of Sony. Their second single "Hanabi" was released on May 31, 2006, earning the band their first appearance on the [[Oricon]] top 10 chart with a number 5 debut. Between November 10 and November 30, they held their first live tour, called "Ikimonogakari no Minna-san, Konni-Tour! 2006". They released their first full-length studio album on March 7, 2007, entitled ''[[Sakura Saku Machi Monogatari]]'', debuting at number 4 on the Oricon weekly album charts. Between May 24 to June 14, they went on a live tour to support this album.  Their second major studio album, ''[[Life Album]]'', came out on February 13, 2008, debuting at number 2 on the Oricon weekly album charts. This album's live tour was from March 30 to May 23. On July 7, they came out with their tenth single, "Bluebird", which also became an opening song for the ''[[Naruto]]'' anime, and the group's first to crack the Top 3 in Oricon Singles. On December 24, they released their third studio album, ''[[My Song Your Song]]''. This album topped the Oricon weekly charts, becoming their first work to achieve a first ranking on any chart. On December 31, they debuted in the [[59th NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen]] festival which gave them considerable national exposure.

===Recognition and ongoing success, 2009-2017===
On March 4, 2009, their first-ever collection of video works, "Tottemo Ēzō", was released. That year, Mizuno was put in charge of writing the song "Yell" as the set piece for the junior high division of the 76th annual NHK Nationwide School Music Contest. Their 15th single "Yell / Joyful" came out September 23, taking the No.&nbsp;1 single spot for the Oricon daily charts and the number 2 spot for the weekly chart, the highest rankings so far for any of their singles. The band won one of the Gold Artist awards at the 2009 [[Best Hits Kayosai|Best Hit Song Festival]] (November 26), their first time winning one of the show's prizes. They followed that up with their fourth studio album ''[[Hajimari no Uta]]'', released on December 23, and debuting as the number 1 album on the Oricon weekly charts.  On New Year's Eve, the band appeared again in the [[60th NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen]] festival.  On June 9, 2012, Japanese television network NHK announced that the theme song for its Olympic broadcasts would be performed by Ikimonogakari.  The song was titled "Kaze ga fuiteiru" (Wind is blowing).  The three members wrote the song and said that its lyrics would hopefully encourage Japan's athletes like a strong wind.<ref>{{cite web|last=Japan Times|title=Ikimonogakari to perform theme song for NHK's Olympic broadcast|url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/entertainment/view/ikimonogakari-to-perform-theme-song-for-nhks-olympic-broadcast|access-date=August 3, 2012}}</ref>  During the Olympics, the band made live appearances in Great Britain on NHK. On March 15, 2016, the day of their 10th anniversary, they released a new album, "Cho-Ikimonogakari~Temnenkinen Members' Best Selection~" and got the number one in music chart.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ikimonogakari.com/|title=いきものがかり OFFICIAL WEB SITE|website=ikimonogakari.com|access-date=2016-09-01}}</ref>
