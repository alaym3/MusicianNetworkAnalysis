==History==

The term "juju" appeared in connection with the [[Priest-King]]s of towns in West Africa, upon whom the prosperity of towns was believed to depend.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=TALBOT|first=P. AMAURY|title=Some Foreign Influences on Nigeria|date=April 1925|journal=African Affairs|volume=XXIV|issue=XCV|pages=178–201|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a100130|issn=1468-2621}}</ref> This is recorded by Sir James George Frazer in Folk-Lore (Vol. XXVI.) He prints, under the title A Priest-King in Nigeria, a communication received from Mr. P. A. Talbot, District Commissioner in S. Nigeria. The writer states that the dominant Ju-Ju of Elele, a town in the N.W. of the Degema district, is a Priest-King, elected for a term of seven years. "The whole prosperity of the town, especially the fruitfulness of farm, byre, and marriage-bed, was linked with his life. Should he fall sick, it entailed family of gana and grave disaster upon the inhabitants."<ref>From Ritual To Romance, Jessie L.

Juju is sometimes used to enforce a contract or ensure compliance. In a typical scenario, the [[witch doctor]] casting the spell requires payment for this service.<ref name=alj>{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/peopleandpower/2011/08/201189141348631784.html|title=People & Power - The Nigerian Connection|work=Al Jazeera|date=11 June 2012}}</ref>
