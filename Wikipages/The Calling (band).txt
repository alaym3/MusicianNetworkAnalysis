'''The Calling''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], formed in 1996 by lead singer and guitarist [[Alex Band]] and guitarist Aaron Kamin. The current, official lineup of the band (as of 2020) consists of Band, Daniel Thomson, Travis Loafman & Joey Clement. Thomson and Loafman both joining The Calling in 2016 while Clement later joined in 2020. They are best known for their hit single, "[[Wherever You Will Go]]", which topped the [[Adult Top 40]] for 23 weeks, making it the [[Smooth (Santana song)|second longest running]] number one in the chart’s history and later named the number one song of the decade of 2000s on the [[Adult Pop Songs|Adult Pop Charts]] by ''Billboard'' magazine. Their debut album ''[[Camino Palmero]]'' was released in July 2001 and was a commercial success.

Their second album ''[[Two (The Calling album)|Two]]'', was released in June 2004. Its lead single "[[Our Lives]]" was featured in the closing ceremonies of the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] as well as the opening song of the 78th annual [[78th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]].

The band broke up in 2005, but in 2013, The Calling reformed with a new lineup.

==History==

===Formation (1996-2000)===
The band was formed by [[Alex Band]] (lead vocals) and [[Aaron Kamin]] (lead guitar, backing vocals) when Kamin was dating Band's sister.<ref>{{cite news

  | quote = The duo met when Kamin, then a premed student at UCLA, began dating Band’s sister. }}</ref> Kamin and Band initially began jamming and writing songs as far back as 1996, and began gigging under the band name "Generation Gap" with a drummer who was twice their age. At this stage, the band also included saxophonist Benny Golbin, giving the songs a more jazzy sound reminiscent of [[Dave Matthews Band]]. Eventually, Band and Kamin ditched the "Gap" lineup, and briefly switched their name to "Next Door", which itself was a nod to [[Ron Fair]], a veteran music business executive and Band's neighbor.

They quickly found their own sound amongst radio rock acts of the early 21st century such as [[Matchbox Twenty]], [[Third Eye Blind]], [[Train (band)|Train]], and [[Fastball (band)|Fastball]]. By 1999, Fair was impressed enough by the demos to sign them to a record deal with [[RCA]]. They changed their name to "The Calling", which reflected the band's sense of purpose.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}

===''Camino Palmero'' and departures of Woolstenhulme, Mohler, and Wood (2001-2002)===
While the RCA deal was a huge boost, it also created a new problem for Band and Kamin: they had no solid band and, thus, had hardly toured and built a fanbase. Rather than putting them out on the road and building regional support, Fair worked intensely with Band and Kamin for over two years perfecting the debut album. The Calling's first album was recorded from 1999–2001, with Sean Woolstenhulme (formerly with [[Lifehouse (band)|Lifehouse]]) (rhythm guitar), [[Billy Mohler]] (bass), and Nate Wood (drums).<ref name=suit>{{cite web

===''Two'' and first breakup (2004-2005)===
In June 2004, the group returned with ''[[Two (The Calling album)|Two]]''. The album had three singles and accompanying videos: "Our Lives", "Things Will Go My Way", and "Anything". However, ''Two'' had disappointing sales compared to [[Camino Palmero|their first album]].

After a lengthy world tour in support of the album, Kamin and Band decided to disband The Calling. They played a farewell show in [[Temecula, California]] on June 6, 2005. Alex then began pursuing a solo career and played occasional shows.

===Temporary reunion and second breakup  (2013)===
On August 15, 2013, Alex Band reformed The Calling with new members. The band performed their comeback gig at [[Bally's Atlantic City]] on August 17.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/alex_band/status/368158125984980992 |title=Twitter / alex_band: BOOM. @TheCallingMusic is BACK! |publisher=Twitter.com |date=2013-08-15 |access-date=2014-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extratv.com/2013/08/15/video-the-calling-returns-with-fresh-take-on-wherever-you-will-go/ |title=Video!

===Upcoming material (2016-present)===
In October 2016, The Calling reformed with a new lineup and performed in [[Manila]], Philippines the following month. The Australian company "''Unbreakable Touring''" announced that the band were to perform in areas such as Adelaide, Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Fremantle along with the rock band [[Juke Kartel]] and newcomer Mike Waters, but this was later postponed due to visa issues. In July 2017 it was announced that The Calling would be joining [[Lifehouse (band)|Lifehouse]] as support acts for [[Live (band)|Live]]'s Australian leg of their world reunion tour.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/live-announce-2017-australian-tour-dates-original-lineup/#/slide/1|title=LIVE Announce 2017 Australian Tour Dates With Original Lineup - Music Feeds|date=2017-07-13|work=Music Feeds|access-date=2017-11-19|language=en-US}}</ref>
