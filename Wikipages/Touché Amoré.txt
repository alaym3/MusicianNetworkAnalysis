=== ''Stage Four'' (2016–2018) ===
Touché Amoré released their fourth studio album and [[Epitaph Records]] debut titled ''Stage Four'' on September 16, 2016.<ref>{{cite press release |last=Morales |first=Christine |title=Touché Amoré Announce New Album on Epitaph |url=http://hosted-p0.vresp.com/1572713/8372426ff2/ARCHIVE |agency=[[Epitaph Records]] |date=June 20, 2016 |access-date=June 21, 2016}}</ref> The title of the album takes on a double meaning, hinting at both the fact it's the band's fourth full-length album and also the highest level of [[cancer staging]]—a reference to the fact that Bolm's mother died of cancer in 2014.<ref name="npr-palmdreams">{{cite web| last = Gotrich| first = Lars| title = Viking's Choice: Touché Amoré, 'Palm Dreams'| work = [[NPR]]| date = June 20, 2016| url = https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2016/06/20/482318261/vikings-choice-touch-amor-palm-dreams| access-date = June 21, 2016}}</ref> Coinciding with the album's announcement in June 2016, the band released the track "Palm Dreams" for online streaming.<ref name="npr-palmdreams"/> The track is about Bolm realizing he will never fully understand why his mom moved to California in the 1970s. He elaborated: "I assume that because she was from a small town, her eyes were wide with the concept of Hollywood. I'm sure someone else in my family could tell me, but it wouldn't be ''her'' answer. If this song inspires anyone to ask the questions they've never asked their loved ones, I'd call it a success."<ref name="npr-palmdreams"/>

After releasing ''Stage Four'', the band spent the next several months touring and playing festivals to help promote their new album, which included shows with [[Balance and Composure]] and Hum, a U.S. Tour with Tiny Moving Parts and Culture Abuse, and festival performances at Sound on Sound Fest in Austin and The Wrecking Ball festival in Atlanta. On October 5, the band announced that they will be doing a U.K./European tour with [[Angel Dust (German band)|Angel Du$t]] in early 2017. The band went on a US tour with Thursday and Basement in spring of 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.punknews.org/article/62966/tours-thursday-basement-touche-amore-us|title=Tours: Thursday / Basement / Touche Amore (US)|last=Punknews.org|website=www.punknews.org|access-date=January 18, 2018}}</ref>

On April 19, 2018, the band released a new single titled "Green", via [[Epitaph Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://exclaim.ca/music/article/touch_amor_-green|title=Touché Amoré "Green"|last=Exclaim.ca|website=exclaim.ca|date=April 19, 2018}}</ref>

=== ''Dead Horse X'' and ''Lament'' (2019–present) ===
To celebrate the tenth anniversary of their debut album, ''...To The Beat Of A Dead Horse'', the band re-recorded the entirety of the record and released it on August 9, 2019 under the name of ''Dead Horse X''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadpress.co.uk/news-touche-amore-share-rerecorded-version-of-suckerfish|title=NEWS: Touché Amoré share re-recorded version of 'Suckerfish'!|website=DEAD PRESS!|access-date=August 9, 2019}}</ref>

On September 10, 2019, the band released a new single titled "Deflector", via Epitaph Records. It was produced by Ross Robinson. On February 17, 2020, the band returned to Robinson to record their upcoming fifth album.

In late July 2020 the band started mailing out flexi discs with a new song ''Limelight'' on it to fans, the song featured singer [[Andy Hull]] from the band [[Manchester Orchestra]]. On July 29 the band officially released the ''Limelight'' as a single, and announced their 5th studio album ''[[Lament (Touché Amoré album)|Lament]]'' to be released on October 9, 2020. The band released 3 subsequent singles for the album, ''Deflector'' on September 11, 2019, ''I'll Be Your Host'' on September 2, 2020, and ''Reminders'' on September 30, 2020. They also released two music videos, one for ''Limelight'' and another one for ''Reminders'', the latter of two consisted of clips of friends of the band with their pets, and featured such people as [[Jason Aalon Butler]], [[Skrillex]], [[Frank Iero]], [[Keith Buckley]], and Andy Hull.

''Lament'' has been described by Bolm as a companion piece to Stage Four, whilst being a departure from the topic of the earlier record. When asked about the record and its relation to ''Stage Four'', Bolm said “I knew I didn’t want to write any more songs about that subject matter, because: a) I’ve done it already, b) I don’t really want to keep living in that headspace, and c) I need to move on from that, as a human. I could literally write five more albums about it, but that’s not good for me or anybody.”<ref>{{cite web|title=Touché Amoré Find Hope On Their New Album, 'Lament'|url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/akz8mg/touche-amore-lament-interview-ross-robinson|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.vice.com|language=en}}</ref> Lament was released to positive critical reviews, amassing a [[Metascore]] of 83.<ref>{{Citation|title=Lament by Touché Amoré|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/lament/touche-amore|language=en|access-date=2020-11-03}}</ref>
