On 15 May 2010, Cerati suffered a massive [[stroke]] in [[Caracas]] following a concert; the stroke left him in a [[coma]], and four years later, on 4 September 2014, Cerati died of [[cardiac arrest]] in [[Buenos Aires]] aged 55.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-gustavo-cerati-20140905-story.html|title=Gustavo Cerati, beloved Argentine rock star, dies at 55|last1=Kraul|first1=Chris|date=8 September 2014|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=24 September 2014|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> He and his band had intended to go to a show-after-party at the rock club Moulin Rouge, located on Francisco Solano López Avenue in the [[Sabana Grande, Caracas|Sabana Grande]] area of [[Caracas]] but his symptoms started developing backstage, right after his last performance concluded.<ref name=":552">{{cite news|title=Cerati: el estilo de vida del rockero argentino antes de su colapso - Edición Impresa|url=http://diario.latercera.com/edicionimpresa/cerati-el-estilo-de-vida-del-rockero-argentino-antes-de-su-colapso/|access-date=2018-06-04|work=Edición Impresa|language=es-ES}}</ref>

==Early life and Soda Stereo==
Cerati was born on 11 August 1959 in [[Barracas, Buenos Aires|Barracas]], [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina. He grew up in a middle class household; his paternal family was of Lombard descent<ref>{{cite web|title=Cómo fueron los últimos años de Gustavo Cerati|url=https://www.rollingstone.com.ar/1749756|publisher=[[RollingStone]]|access-date=4 January 2015|language=es|date=5 December 2014|quote=(...) que la llamara a la tía Dora, la hermana de Juan José, que sabía mejor la historia de cómo los Cerati habían llegado a Argentina desde [[Mozzate]] [Lombardía], un pueblito al norte de Italia.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104215008/http://www.rollingstone.com.ar/1749756|archive-date=4 January 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and his maternal family was of Irish origin.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gustavo Cerati y su canción más personal: la emotiva historia detrás de Té para tres|url=http://www.ciudad.com.ar/espectaculos/122563/gustavo-cerati-cancion-mas-personal-emotiva-historia-detras-tres|website=Ciudad.com.ar|access-date=4 January 2015|language=es|date=4 September 2014|quote=Se trata de Té para tres, una hermosa balada de Soda Stereo, cuya letra hace referencia a una reunión que mantuvo el rockero con sus padres, Juan José Cerati y Lilian Clark.

Estábamos los tres, Gustavo, mi marido y yo.}}</ref> His father was an accountant and regularly traveled abroad. From his early memories he had an idyllic love of the sun and nature. Cerati's first passion was art and in elementary school he drew comics and created his own comic book characters.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Cerati's parents, Juan José Cerati and Lilian Clark, acquired a guitar for him when he was nine years old, at that point Cerati started to take music seriously, becoming a fanatic of rock and roll:

After serving compulsory military service in 1979, Cerati entered the university to pursue a degree in marketing, something that he was not passionate about. His family supported him with his music, "Mi familia me vio tan enloquecido con la música, que pensaron que algo de éxito iba a tener" (My family saw that I was so crazy about music, that they thought I would have some success [with it]). At the [[Universidad del Salvador]], a Jesuit university in [[Buenos Aires]], he met [[Zeta Bosio|Héctor "Zeta" Bosio]], also a marketing student. The two hit it off and decided to form a band. They were fans of [[The Police]], [[The Beatles]], [[XTC]], [[Elvis Costello]], Television, and [[The Talking Heads]]. In 1982, after various lineup changes that included Richard Coleman, Daniel Melero, and [[Andrés Calamaro]] as well as others, Bosio and Cerati recruited [[Charly Alberti]] as their drummer, thus forming [[Soda Stereo]].<ref name="Cerati.com" />

[[Soda Stereo]] signed to Sony Music in 1984 and released their debut LP ''[[Soda Stereo]]'' that same year. ''[[Nada personal (album)|Nada Personal]]'' ("Nothing Personal") followed in 1985 giving Soda Stereo their first hit with "[[Cuando pase el temblor]]" ("When The Earthquake Is Past"). Soda released ''[[Signos]]'' ("Signs") in 1986, ''[[Doble Vida]]'' ("Double Life") (produced by longtime [[David Bowie]] collaborator [[Carlos Alomar]]) in 1988, and ''[[Canción Animal]]'' ("Animal Song") in 1990. During the 1990s [[Soda Stereo]] released  ''[[Dynamo]]'' in 1992, ''[[Sueño Stereo]]'' ("Stereo Dream") in 1995, and their final album ''[[Comfort y Música Para Volar]]'' ("Comfort and music to fly with") in 1997.

==Solo career==
===1990s===

In 1992 Cerati recorded ''[[Colores Santos]]'' ("Holy Colors") with electronic musician Daniel Melero, a longtime [[Soda Stereo]] collaborator. 1993 saw the release of Cerati's first solo album ''[[Amor Amarillo]]'' ("Yellow Love"), which included the participation of [[Zeta Bosio]] and Cerati's wife at the time, the Chilean singer, actress, and model [[Cecilia Amenábar]] who sang and appeared in the video for the lead single "Te llevo para que me lleves" ("I'll take you so you can take me").<ref>[[Cecilia Amenábar]]</ref><ref name="Amilicar">{{cite news|last1=Amilicar|first1=Nani|title=Los grandes amores de Gustavo Cerati|url=http://www.clarin.com/extrashow/musica/gustavo-cerati-los_romances-amores-parejas_0_1205879937.html|access-date=25 September 2014|work=Clarin|date=4 September 2014|language=es}}</ref>

In 1995 Gustavo Cerati teamed up with three Chilean musicians, Andrés Bucci, Guillermo Ugarte, and Christian Powditch, to form ''Plan V''. Plan V released two albums ''Plan V'' (1996), and ''Plan Black V Dog'' (1998), a collaboration with the British electronic music group [[The Black Dog (band)|The Black Dog]].<ref>{{cite web|title=¿Cuál fue el "Plan V" de Gustavo Cerati en los 90?|url=http://www.guioteca.com/los-90/cual-fue-el-%E2%80%9Cplan-v%E2%80%9D-de-gustavo-cerati-en-los-90/|website=Guioteca: Que Quieres Saber|publisher=Empresa el Mercurio|access-date=24 September 2014|language=es|year=2012}}</ref> In 1999 Cerati formed the electronic duo Ocio with longtime [[Soda Stereo]] collaborator and trumpeter, Flavio Etcheto, releasing ''Medida Universal''.

Around this time Cerati participated in the album ''Outlandos d'Americas: A Rock en Español Tribute to the Police'' collaborating with [[Andy Summers]] of [[The Police]] and [[Vinnie Colaiuta]] ([[Frank Zappa]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]), on a cover of [[The Police]]'s "Bring on the Night," (Spanish: Traeme la Noche).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Van Der Gugten|first1=Rogier|title=Outlandos d'Americas: A Rock En Espanol Tribute to The Police – various artists|url=http://www.cybercomm.nl/~gugten/album67.htm|website=Rogier's The Police Page}}</ref>

''[[Bocanada]]'' ("Puff") was released in 1999 and was regarded as Gustavo Cerati's proper debut as a solo artist. It was recorded in Estudio CasaSubmarina (Cerati's home studio) in [[Buenos Aires]]. Cerati used an [[Music Production Center|MPC]] to record many of the tracks. The 48-piece orchestra in "Verbo Carne" was recorded in [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London. The album was also mixed and mastered in London at [[Townhouse Studios]]. ''[[Bocanada]]''' immediately reached gold status in [[Argentina]] and received many accolades in the Argentinian and Latin American press. The album was universally praised for its grandeur and its beauty and is still considered by critics and fans alike as Cerati's ''[[magnum opus]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Semana Ceratiana: Bocanada|url=http://escritoscirculares.blogspot.mx/2014/09/semana-ceratiana-bocanada.html|website=Escritores Circulares|date=10 September 2014|access-date=25 September 2014|language=es}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=MFH|title="Bocanada", el mejor disco de Gustavo Cerati|url=http://eleconomista.com.mx/entretenimiento/2014/09/06/bocanada-mejor-disco-gustavo-cerati|website=El Economista|access-date=24 September 2014}}</ref> The veteran [[Mexican people|Mexican]] rock critic David Cortés Arce had this to say about it, "''[[Bocanada]]'' is a fundamental album in the history of Iberoamerican Rock, in general, in all of the Spanish speaking countries."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cortés Arce|first1=David|last2=González|first2=Yayo|last3=Galvez|first3=Demián|title='Bocanada' es considerado el mejor disco de Cerati|url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/funcion/2014/09/07/980371|website=Excelsior|date=7 September 2014|publisher=InventMX|access-date=24 September 2014|language=es}}</ref>

===2000–05===
In 2001 Cerati made his foray into film with the score for the movie ''[[+Bien]]'' (literally, "+Good." A better translation of the phrase as used in Argentina would be "Of course", "duh!"), in which he acted in as well. The film was an independent movie directed by Eduardo Capilla, and starred [[Ruth Infarinato]], [[VJ (media personality)|VJ]] for [[MTV (Latin America)|Latin MTV]]. Cerati's wife at the time, [[Cecilia Amenábar]], also played a small role in the film.<ref>{{cite web|title=Más bien (2001)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0301642/|website=IMDb.com|access-date=24 September 2014}}</ref> The soundtrack was nominated for an award in the category of best instrumental pop album at the [[3rd Annual Latin Grammy Awards]].

In August 2001 Cerati held a private concert in the historic [[Avenida Theatre]] in Buenos Aires. He was accompanied by a 42 piece orchestra conducted by Alejandro Terán. The recording of the concert was released as ''[[11 Episodios Sinfónicos]]'' ("Eleven Symphonic Episodes") and consisted of seven arrangements of [[Soda Stereo]] classics and four of his solo songs played entirely by orchestra. Cerati took ''[[11 Episodios Sinfónicos]]'' on the road, playing [[Mexico City]], Caracas, [[Santiago]], and finishing it off with three shows at [[Teatro Gran Rex|the Gran Rex theater]] in Buenos Aires. The CD was well received by critics and fans alike and a live DVD was eventually released.<ref name="Cerati.com" />

In November 2002 Cerati released his third studio album ''[[Siempre es Hoy]]'' ("It's Always Today"). Cerati enlisted the help of producer/ engineer Sacha Triujeque and Antonio "Toy" Hernández of the Mexican [[Hip hop]] group [[Control Machete]]. The album was a departure from the slow tempo, [[Trip hop]] of ''[[Bocanada]]'' and ''[[+Bien]]'', and the dramatic orchestration of ''[[11 Episodios Sinfónicos]]''. The songs on the album varied from pop/rock to radio friendly electronic rock. The tour for ''[[Siempre es Hoy]]'' extended as far as New York and Chicago.
 
In 2003 Cerati released ''Siempre es Hoy: Reversiones'' ("It's Always Today: Re-versions") an album of remixes of ''[[Siempre es Hoy]]'' tracks from different Latin American Musicians and the German producer Wechsel Garland.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Adaime|first1=Iván|title=Reversiones/Siempre Es Hoy|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/reversiones-siempre-es-hoy-mw0000328581|website=Allmusic.com|access-date=24 September 2014}}</ref>

Simultaneously, Cerati teamed up with longtime collaborator Flavio Etcheto, and Leandro Fresco to form the self-described "power laptop trio" Roken, which he played concurrently during the ''[[Siempre es Hoy]]'' tour. Roken's non-conventional approach focused on improvisation and writing songs in real time. They played in various festivals throughout Latin America as well as in underground clubs in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Otros Proyectos: Roken|url=http://cerati.com/proyectos/roken/|website=Cerati.com|language=es}}</ref>

In 2004 "Canciones Elegidas 93-04" ("Selected Songs 93-04") a double album compilation of Cerati's solo work was released simultaneously in [[Spain]] and [[Argentina]]. The release was followed by a small tour of [[Mexico]], [[Argentina]], [[Chile]] and [[Spain]].

===2005–10===
After working for much of 2005 on new material, Cerati released ''[[Ahí Vamos]]'' ("There We Go") in April 2006. Co-produced by longtime [[Soda Stereo]] collaborator [[Tweety González]], ''[[Ahí Vamos]]'' marked Cerati's triumphant return to guitar rock. For the recording of ''[[Ahí Vamos]]'', Cerati was accompanied by longtime collaborators, [[Richard Coleman]], Fernando Nalé, and many others. The album was mixed by Héctor Castillo, a prolific engineer whose credits include [[David Bowie]], [[Lou Reed]], and [[Aterciopelados]], to name a few.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hector Castillo: Credits|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/h%C3%A9ctor-castillo-mn0000089262/credits|website=Allmusic.com|publisher=All Media Network, LLC.|access-date=24 September 2014}}</ref> The album was mastered by [[Howie Weinberg]] at [[Masterdisk]] in New York City. ''[[Ahí Vamos]]'' was lauded by fans and critics alike as a return to form for Cerati. The ''[[Ahí Vamos]]'' tour traveled through Latin America, the [[Caribbean]], the United States (where he played in New York's [[Central Park]]),<ref>{{cite news|title=Gustavo Cerati, Talented And Beloved Argentinian Rocker, Dies After Four Years in Coma|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/entertainment/2014/09/04/argentine-rocker-gustavo-cerati-dies-after-four-years-in-coma/|access-date=24 September 2014|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Fox News Latino|date=4 September 2014}}</ref> Spain, and on 12 October 2006, Cerati played London, England, for the first time in his career.<ref name="Cerati.com" />

The album was showered with accolades and awards, receiving eight [[Premios Gardel|Gardel]] (equivalent of a U.S. Grammy) nominations in Argentina and winning all but one of the nominations, a first for any Argentinian artist. In the [[Viña del Mar International Song Festival]] Cerati was awarded the top prizes, "''Antorcha de Oro''," (Gold Torch) and the "''Gaviota De Plata''" (Silver Seagull). It was the most nominated album during the 2006 Latin Grammy awards as well as the MTV Latino awards. Cerati won three Grammys, for best Rock Vocal, best Rock song, and one for best producer with his production work on [[Shakira]]'s [[Fijación Oral, Vol. 1]] (Oral Fixation, Vol. 1). ''[[Ahí Vamos]]'' also topped the "best of" lists in the Argentinian press and he was even awarded a prize by the City of [[Buenos Aires]] for his contribution to Argentinian culture.<ref name="Cerati.com" /> Cerati closed the ''[[Ahí Vamos]]'' tour with a massive open air show in [[Buenos Aires]], held on the corner of Avenida Alcorta and Pampas. The free show was attended by 200,000 people.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

2007 also saw the reunion of [[Soda Stereo]]. The subsequent comeback tour [[Me Verás Volver]] ("You will See Me Return") consisted of 22 concerts in nine countries: [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Ecuador]], [[Mexico]] the United States, [[Colombia]], [[Panamá]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Perú]]. The tour was attended by more than one million fans and broke attendance records in various cities.

In July 2007, Cerati participated in the [[Live Earth (2007 concert)|Live Earth Festival]] in Hamburg Germany, alongside [[Shakira]].<ref>[[Live Earth concert, Hamburg]]</ref> Besides working with [[Shakira]], Cerati contributed to, [[Argentina|Argentinian]] producer, musician, and two-time Oscar winner, [[Gustavo Santaolalla|Gustavo Santaolla's]] album ''Mar Dulce'' ("Sweet Sea"). Cerati sang on "El Mareo" the second single on Santaolalla's ''Mar Dulce'' which was recorded at [[Electric Lady Studios]] in New York City.<ref>{{cite news|title=Las colaboraciones inolvidables de Gustavo Cerati en la música Artistas como Roger Waters, Shakira y Café Tacvba, entre muchos otros, compartieron el escenario o el estudio con el músico fallecido|url=http://mexico.cnn.com/entretenimiento/2014/09/05/las-colaboraciones-inolvidables-de-gustavo-cerati-en-la-musica|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906011729/http://mexico.cnn.com/entretenimiento/2014/09/05/las-colaboraciones-inolvidables-de-gustavo-cerati-en-la-musica|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 September 2014|access-date=25 September 2014|agency=CNN Mexico|publisher=Cable News Network|date=5 September 2014|language=es}}</ref> In 2008, Cerati released a DVD version of ''[[Ahí Vamos]]'' and performed in various festivals throughout Latin America alongside, [[Shakira]], [[Fito Páez]], and [[Gustavo Santaolalla]].<ref name="Cerati.com" />

In late 2008 Cerati recruited many of the same musicians who worked on ''[[Ahí Vamos]]'' to begin work on his new album. In March 2009, Cerati and his band traveled to Stratosphere Sound in New York City and Looking Glass studios to record tracks for ''[[Fuerza Natural]]'' ("Natural Force"). Notable contributors included Héctor Castillo, Session drummer [[Sterling Campbell]] whose resume includes [[David Bowie]], [[Cyndi Lauper]], and [[Duran Duran]], Didi Gutman of [[Brazilian Girls]], bassist and lap steel guitarists Byron Isaacs, and keyboardist Glenn Patscha.<ref name="Cerati.com" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Gustavo Cerati: Fuerza Natural: Credits|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/fuerza-natural-mw0000826658/credits|website=Allmusic.com|access-date=25 September 2014|ref=All Music}}</ref>

[[File:Gustavo Cerati (4121340388).jpg|thumb|250px|Cerati playing live in 2009]]
''[[Fuerza Natural]]'' was a marked change from the riffing of [[Ahí Vamos]] and the electronics of ''[[Bocanada]]'' and ''[[Siempre es Hoy]]''. The collections of songs focused on a cleaner, more [[Acoustic guitar|acoustic]] pop sound, as well as [[Folk music|folk]] and [[Neo-psychedelia]]. [[Rolling Stone]] [[Argentina]] took notice of this, "pero es más folkie, más espacial y más acústico, con una legión de guitarras, mandolinas y dobros que levantan polvo sobre las programaciones" (English: but it is more folkie, more spatial and acoustic, with a legion of guitars, mandolins, and dobros that sprinkle dust on the sequencers).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Plotkin|first1=Pablo|title=Gustavo Cerati – Fuerza Natural|url=https://www.rollingstone.com.ar/1168101|website=Rolling Stone Argentina|access-date=25 September 2014|ref=Rolling Stone|language=es|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017184623/http://www.rollingstone.com.ar/1168101|archive-date=17 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Similar observations were made by Mariano Prunes writing in [[AllMusic]], "[[Fuerza Natural]] has a curious sequencing structure, as it seems to be organized in stylistic batches. It begins with a trio of [[Good faith|bona fide]] Cerati hits in that suave, effortless manner that always suited him so well; it then switches to a surprising but rather unsuccessful bluesy/folksy diptych."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Prunes|first1=Mariano|title=Gustavo Cerati: Fuerza Natural|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/fuerza-natural-mw0000826658|website=Allmusic.com|access-date=25 September 2014|ref=All Music}}</ref>

Regardless of the mixed reviews, ''[[Fuerza Natural]]'' entered the charts in [[Argentina]], [[Mexico]], and [[Chile]] at No. 1. It is the first Cerati album to be sold in digital format in [[Argentina]] through [[MusicPass]] as well as was [[iTunes]]. The album sold 40,000 copies in Argentina on its first week of release and 500,000 albums worldwide.<ref>Fuerza natural</ref> In 2010 Cerati was awarded a Latin Grammy for "Best Rock Song."

The ''[[Fuerza Natural]]'' tour kicked off on 19 November in [[Monterrey]] Mexico. Cerati played Stadiums and large venues in [[Mexico]], [[Argentina]], [[Peru]], [[Chile]], The United States, [[Uruguay]], [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]], 21 shows in total. Cerati's final show was held in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]] on 15 May 2010. Cerati suffered a stroke immediately after the show.

==Personal life==
Gustavo Cerati maintained a very low public profile and not much is known about his private life. Cerati's first wife was Belén Edwards, an Argentine designer whom he married in 1987 and divorced in 1989. In 1992 he married the Chilean model, actress, and singer [[Cecilia Amenábar]]. Their marriage lasted for ten years and they had two children Benito Cerati Amenábar, also a singer and musician, and Lisa Cerati Amenábar.

After his divorce from Cecilia Amenábar, Cerati dated the [[Argentina|Argentine]] model [[Deborah del Corral]],<ref name="Los grandes amores de Cerati">{{cite news|last1=Almicar|first1=Nani|title=Los grandes amores de Cerati|url=http://www.clarin.com/extrashow/musica/gustavo-cerati-los_romances-amores-parejas_0_1205879937.html|access-date=25 September 2014|work=Clarin|date=4 September 2014|language=es}}</ref> ex-girlfriend of [[Soda Stereo]] drummer [[Charly Alberti]] in the 1990s.

In 2008 Cerati started dating the [[Argentina|Argentine]] actress Leonora Balcarce. While they broke up in late 2009, she remained friendly with him and his family, visiting his bedside throughout his coma.<ref name="Los grandes amores de Cerati"/>

Cerati maintained from 2004 until his last days a close acquaintance with the Uruguayan artist [[Jill Mulleady]]. <ref>{{Cite news|last=Redacción LA NACION|date=2005-05-03|title=Con nombre y apellido|language=es-AR|work=La Nación|url=https://www.lanacion.com.ar/espectaculos/con-nombre-y-apellido-nid700902/|access-date=2021-11-30|issn=0325-0946}}</ref>

Cerati met Argentinean model Chloe Bello during the summer of 2009, when she was 22 years old. Despite the age difference, the two of them became involved. Cerati invited Bello to attend the launch of [[Fuerza Natural]] in [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] and subsequently joined him on an international tour. Due to work obligations, Bello left his side before Cerati travelled to [[Caracas]], where he suffered a stroke that led to a coma, complications from which eventually cost him his life four years later.<ref name="Los grandes amores de Cerati"/>

==Failing health and death==
After performing two shows in [[Medellín]] and [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]], Cerati headed to Venezuela and performed one last show in Caracas on 15 May 2010. Cerati suffered a stroke<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noticias.cerati.com/2010/estado_de_salud_de_gustavo.php |title=Estado de salud de Gustavo - Cerati.com |publisher=Noticias.cerati.com |date=18 May 2010 |access-date=2012-03-02}}</ref> just after putting an end to this performance. He developed the first symptoms of an unknown condition backstage. He was hospitalized in Centro Médico La Trinidad in Caracas under medical surveillance. Three days later, Cerati underwent surgery to relieve pressure on his brain due to the stroke he suffered.

On 7 June 2010, Cerati was transferred to the FLENI Neurological Institute in Buenos Aires.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/cerati-pais-fleni-aseguran-estable_0_B1xQZV-CPml.html |title=Cerati ya está en el país y aseguran que sigue estable |date=8 June 2010 |publisher=Clarin.com |access-date=2012-03-02}}</ref> Doctors immediately treated Cerati for a respiratory tract infection.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gustavo Cerati tiene "extenso" daño cerebral e infección respiratoria|url=http://www.semana.com/mundo/articulo/gustavo-cerati-tiene-extenso-dano-cerebral-infeccion-respiratoria/117736-3|access-date=30 September 2014|work=Semana|issue=1691|language=es}}</ref> The following day, doctors reported extensive brain damage due to the stroke. Cerati fell into a coma sometime before. He was maintained on life support hoping for a recovery. A month after the stroke, Claudio E. Pensa M.D., medical director of the FLENI Neurological Institute, issued a statement to the press stating that Cerati's medical condition remained unchanged and that he would only provide new information if changes were to occur. On 2 December 2010, a statement was issued by ALCLA Clinic's medical director stating that, neurologically, Cerati was reacting to thermal stimuli.<ref name="Cerati.com" />

On 14 May 2014, the family released a statement to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the stroke. It included a medical report by Gustavo Barbalace M.D. stating: "Mr. Gustavo Cerati remains hospitalized (...) without any serious complications, in good nutritional shape and without lesions due to immobility. Neurologically there's no significant changes and remains under mechanical respiratory aid."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noticias.cerati.com/2014/cuatro_anos.php |title=CERATI.COM - Noticias oficiales - Cuatro Años 02/12 |publisher=Noticias.cerati.com |access-date=2014-05-14}}</ref>
