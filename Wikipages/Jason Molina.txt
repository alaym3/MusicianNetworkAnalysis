'''Jason Andrew Molina''' (December 30, 1973 – March 16, 2013) was an American musician, singer and songwriter. Raised in northern Ohio, he came to prominence performing and recording as '''Songs: Ohia''', both in solo projects and with a rotating cast of musicians in the late 1990s. Beginning in 2003, he would garner a further indie following for his releases with the band '''Magnolia Electric Co.'''

Molina had a prolific career between his two musical projects and solo releases,<ref>{{cite web|work=NPR|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/04/22/304918830/remembering-jason-molina-a-musician-who-refused-to-look-back|title=Remembering Jason Molina, a musician who refused to look back|date=April 22, 2014|access-date=October 4, 2017|author=Masters, Clay}}</ref> producing a total of sixteen studio albums, eight EPs, and numerous singles. His overall discography was noted by critics for blending elements of [[indie rock]], blues, and [[alternative country]] with his [[tenor]] vocal range.

In 2009, Molina canceled a tour with [[Will Johnson (musician)|Will Johnson]], citing health problems. He spent the next four years dealing with alcoholism, which ultimately resulted in his death from [[Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome|multiple organ failure]] in March 2013.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/arts/music/jason-molina-leader-of-magnolia-electric-band-dies-at-39.html|title=Jason Molina, a Balladeer of Heartbreak, Dies at 39|last=Yardley|first=William|date=March 26, 2013|work=The New York Times|access-date=January 17, 2020|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Molina attended [[Oberlin College]], graduating with a bachelor of arts degree in art history in 1996.<ref>{{Citation|title=Jason Molina Lorain Schools Alumni Assoc. Inductee 2019|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF6ARq4o6xM|language=en|access-date=May 7, 2021}}</ref><ref name=guardian /><ref name=ny>{{cite web|work=The New York Times|author=Yardley, William|date=March 26, 2013|title=Jason Molina, a Balladeer of Heartbreak, Dies at 39|access-date=October 5, 2017|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/arts/music/jason-molina-leader-of-magnolia-electric-band-dies-at-39.html}}</ref> After playing bass guitar in various metal bands in and around Cleveland, Molina became a solo artist under an assumed band name, recruiting other musicians for each project as needed. He made several home recordings under various names, including "Songs: Albian", "Songs: Radix", and "Songs: Unitas", which he distributed himself at live performances.

== Career ==
=== Songs: Ohia: 1995–2003 ===
Songs: Ohia was largely a project of revolving musicians with Molina as its center and sole stable member. The band's genre is generally considered [[indie rock]], [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]], [[Folk music|folk]], or [[alt-country]]. The second part of the name is an allusion to both the Hawaiian tree ''[[Metrosideros polymorpha|'Ōhi'a lehua]]'' and Molina's home state of Ohio.

The first Songs: Ohia release came in 1995 as a single on [[Palace Records]], ''Nor Cease Thou Never Now''.<ref name=allmusic>{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p293301|label=Songs: Ohia}}</ref> This was followed by the 1997 full-length album ''Songs: Ohia'' (known among fans as the ''Black Album''), released on the [[Bloomington, Indiana]]-based label [[Secretly Canadian]].

In 2000, Molina released three albums: ''[[The Lioness (album)|The Lioness]]'', recorded in [[Glasgow]] by producer [[Andy Miller (record producer)|Andy Miller]] with help from [[Alasdair Roberts (musician)|Alasdair Roberts]] and members of [[Arab Strap (band)|Arab Strap]]; ''Ghost Tropic'', recorded by [[Mike Mogis]]; and ''[[Protection Spells]]'', a solo album sold at live shows and now out of print. By 2000, Molina had given his tenor guitar a rest in favor of a regular six-string electric guitar and put together a full band to back him, including brothers Rob and [[Dan Sullivan (musician)|Dan Sullivan]] on bass and guitar, Jeff Panall on drums, and Jim Grabowski on organ. In the same year the touring band recorded a live album near [[Modena]], Italy, released locally in 2001 as ''Mi Sei Apparso Come Un Fantasma''.

In 2002, Molina recorded ''[[Didn't It Rain (Songs: Ohia album)|Didn't It Rain]]'' in Philadelphia with members of [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] band [[Jim & Jennie & the Pinetops]]. On the album, named after a [[Mahalia Jackson]] song, the band achieved an almost gospel sound that was a vast departure from the dense feel of ''[[Ghost Tropic]]''. Constantly recording and writing new songs, Songs: Ohia released a handful of singles and EPs in 2002, including a split EP with [[My Morning Jacket]] and a collaborative EP (under the name [[Amalgamated Sons of Rest]]) with [[Will Oldham]] and [[Alasdair Roberts (musician)|Alasdair Roberts]].

The 2003 release ''Magnolia Electric Co.'' marked a shift in direction for Songs: Ohia. Every song was recorded live in the studio with a full touring band plus musicians from ''Didn't It Rain''.

The album's sound draws heavily from the [[heartland rock]] and folk-rock of the 1960s/70s, as well as Molina's heavy metal roots (British metal pioneers [[Black Sabbath]] are often cited as one of Molina's influences).

=== Magnolia Electric Co.: 2003–2012 ===
[[File:Magnolia Electric Co. live 20050707.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Molina (left) with his band Magnolia Electric Co. in 2005]]
In March 2003, while on tour, Molina announced that he would rename the band Magnolia Electric Co., retaining the stylistic direction of the album of the same name. He also continued to release solo work under his own name. The first such release came in January 2004 as the full-length vinyl release ''Pyramid Electric Co.''

Though ''Magnolia Electric Co.'' and ''Pyramid Electric Co.'' were originally intended as a double album, the latter seems to be the stylistic polar opposite of the former.

Engineered by Mike Mogis, who also engineered ''Ghost Tropic'', ''Pyramid'' found Molina alone at the microphone with only his voice and a piano or guitar. Magnolia Electric Co.'s first official release was a live album, ''Trials and Errors'', followed by a studio album, ''What Comes After the Blues'', and an EP, ''Hard to Love a Man'', all released in 2005. In 2006, Molina released two more records: the sparse solo ''Let Me Go, Let Me Go, Let Me Go'' and the more conventional ''Fading Trails'' with Magnolia Electric Co., the latter culled from three separate sessions over the previous year.

It is not entirely clear when Songs: Ohia became Magnolia Electric Co. In interviews, Molina claimed that he considered the tenure of Songs: Ohia over after ''Didn't It Rain'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.recordhospital.org/molina|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 4, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081104145015/http://www.recordhospital.org/molina|title=record.hospital.molina|work=Record Hospital|access-date=October 23, 2007}}</ref> which would make ''Magnolia Electric Co.'' the self-titled debut album under the new name. The name "Songs: Ohia" appears nowhere on the artwork of the album and only a promotional sticker on the [[cellophane]] wrapping connects it with the prior name. Nevertheless, [[Secretly Canadian]] still promotes the album under the Songs: Ohia moniker. On the other hand, the Magnolia Electric Co. live album ''Trials and Errors'' was recorded on April 16, 2003 at the [[Ancienne Belgique]] club in [[Brussels]], at a time when the band was still touring under the Songs: Ohia name. [[Pitchfork Media]] later reported that name change would be made official after the Spanish tour in October 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/news/03-08/22.shtml |title=Pitchfork: Daily Music News |access-date=October 28, 2006|url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030823160310/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/news/03-08/22.shtml |archive-date=August 23, 2003 }}</ref>

=== Later years and illness: 2009–2013 ===

According to Magnolia Electric Co. bandmate Jason Groth, Molina "and the bottle had a complicated relationship" dating back as far as 2003.<ref name="groth4242013">The Beach Dog: "[http://groakus.tumblr.com/post/48775406486/magnolia-electric-company-tour-diary-august-24-2009 Magnolia Electric Company Tour Diary, August 24, 2009]"</ref> The full extent of his alcoholism was not revealed to many of his close friends until after 2009.<ref name="groth4242013" />

A European tour for Molina & Johnson in support of their [[Molina & Johnson|self-titled album]] was scheduled for November and December 2009; the tour was canceled on November 23, three days before it was to begin.<ref name="pitchfork-euro">{{cite web|work=[[Pitchfork Media]]|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/37201-molina-and-johnson-cancel-euro-tour/|title= Molina and Johnson Cancel Euro Tour|access-date=October 4, 2017|author=Breihan, Tom|date=November 23, 2009}}</ref> A brief note on the band's website blamed "health problems" (without elaborating) for the cancelations and noted, "Jason Molina is extremely disappointed but there is no way he can be on the road at the present time."<ref name="pitchfork-euro" /> A U.S. leg of the Molina & Johnson tour was scheduled for January and February 2010 but was canceled in early December with another brief note on the band's website citing Molina's "present health issues".<ref name="brooklyn">{{cite web|work=Brooklyn Vegan|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2009/12/jason_molina_wi.html|title= Jason Molina & Will Johnson cancel tour in support of their new Secretly Canadian album|access-date=October 4, 2017|date=December 1, 2009}}</ref> Following this announcement, Molina effectively withdrew from public life.

On September 19, 2011, a message from Molina's family was posted on the Secretly Canadian Records website, titled "Where Is Jason Molina?", which said that over the preceding two years Molina had visited rehab facilities and hospitals in England, Chicago, [[Indianapolis]], and [[New Orleans]] for an unnamed condition.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} His family wrote that he was "currently working on a farm in West Virginia raising goats and chickens for the next year or so, and is looking forward to making great music again."{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

On May 5, 2012, a post titled "a note from jason" was posted on the Magnolia Electric Co. website, explaining certain aspects of his situation for the first time.<ref name="notefromjason">Magnoliaelectricco.com post: "[http://content.magnoliaelectricco.com/post/22383327772/a-note-from-jason a note from jason] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318190919/http://content.magnoliaelectricco.com/post/22383327772/a-note-from-jason |date=2013-03-18 }}."</ref> Saying that it had been "a long hospital year", Molina expressed gratitude and appreciation for the monetary and emotional support he had received from fans and friends.<ref name="notefromjason" /> He gave a brief update on his condition, saying, "Treatment is good, getting to deal with a lot of things that even the music didn't want to. I have not given up because you, my friends have not given up on me." The note concludes optimistically, saying that there were a few music projects on the "distant radar screen".<ref name="notefromjason" />

Molina died on March 16, 2013 in [[Indianapolis]] of alcohol abuse-related organ failure. He was 39.<ref name=pitchforkdead>{{cite web|last=Snapes|first=Laura|title=R.I.P.

Music critics noted Molina's music for its unique blend of indie rock with blues, alternative country, and lo-fi music, which combined "[[Rust Belt]] grit with [[Americana (music)|Americana music]]'s pastoral imagery."<ref name=guardian /><ref>{{cite web|work=Paste Magazine|title=The 13 Best Songs by Jason Molina|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/05/the-13-best-songs-by-jason-molina.html|date=May 16, 2017|author=Saunders, Hilary|access-date=October 4, 2017}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}}s William Yardley characterized Molina as a "balladeer of heartbreak".<ref name=ny /> He possessed a [[tenor]] vocal range.<ref name=ny />
