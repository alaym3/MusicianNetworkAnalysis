'''Eiffel 65''' is an Italian music group that was formed in 1998 in the studios of the [[Turin]] record company [[Bliss Corporation]], consisting of [[Jeffrey Jey]], [[Maurizio Lobina]] and [[Gabry Ponte]]. They gained global popularity with their singles "[[Blue (Da Ba Dee)]]" and "[[Move Your Body (Eiffel 65 song)|Move Your Body]]," from their 1999 studio album ''[[Europop (album)|Europop]]''. The singles reached number one in many countries, while the album peaked at number four on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. Their following two albums, ''[[Contact!]]'' (2001) and their 2003 self titled album did not gain as much success, but still managed to gain success in Italy.

Over the course of their career, the group won a [[World Music Award]] in 2000 for the World Best Selling Italian Group, and a [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|B.M.I]] USA in Los Angeles, rewarding the most-broadcast song on radio in the United States. They were also nominated at the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording|Best Dance Recording]] for "Blue (Da Ba Dee)."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2001/grammys.htm|title=Rock On The Net: 43rd Annual Grammy Awards - 2001|website=Rockonthenet.com}}</ref> ''Europop'' was crowned as the greatest album of the 1990s by [[Channel 4]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiffel65.com/music|title=Eiffel 65 &#124; Music|website=Eiffel65.com}}</ref>

Eiffel 65 also composed remixes of numerous popular songs, and they recorded "[[One Goal (Eiffel 65 song)|One Goal]]," one of the official songs of the [[UEFA Euro 2000]], and "Living In My City," for the [[2006 Winter Olympics]]. With more than 20 million copies sold<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://milano.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/16_giugno_04/eiffel-65-revival-dance-zarro-night-0716377c-2a3b-11e6-9c68-4645b6fa27fd.shtml|title=Eiffel 65: revival dance a "Zarro night"|date=June 4, 2016|website=Milano.corriere.it}}</ref> and many gold, platinum and diamond [[Music recording certification|records]], Eiffel 65 is one of Italy's most popular electronic groups.

In 2005, DJ Gabry Ponte left the group to focus on his solo career, and later that year, the remaining members Jeffrey Jey and Maurizio Lobina formed their own duo called [[Bloom 06]]. In 2010, the original group reunited; although Ponte does not participate in record production and concerts, he never officially left the group.

==History==
===Formation===
Randone, Ponte and Lobina met at [[Bliss Team|Bliss Corporation]], which was founded in 1992 by Massimo Gabutti. A computer chose the name ''Eiffel'' randomly from a group of words the three had selected but the number ''65'' was added to it by mistake: the producer had written a phone number on a piece of paper and two digits of it ended up on the label copy. The graphic artist who received it assumed that it had been added afterwards so he just fused it to the band name for their first release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/rn5mg6/eiffel-65-interview-blue-da-ba-dee|title=Eiffel 65 Are the Fathers to Your Style Even If You're Too Much of a Dick to Admit It|website=vice.com}}</ref>

===1998–2005===
Eiffel 65 became famous for their international chart-topping hits "Blue (Da Ba Dee)" and "Move Your Body." Both songs were featured singles on their debut album ''[[Europop (album)|Europop]],'' which was released on November 22, 1999. 

The band achieved considerable success in Italy and the rest of Europe,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lescharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Eiffel+65&titel=Blue+(Da+Ba+Dee)&cat=s|title=lescharts.com - Eiffel 65 - Blue (Da Ba Dee)|last=Hung|first=Steffen|website=Lescharts.com|access-date=2018-06-05}}</ref> in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Brazil.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Eiffel+65|title=australian-charts.com - Discography Eiffel 65|last=Hung|first=Steffen|website=Australian-charts.com|access-date=2018-06-05}}</ref> ''Europop'' peaked in the top five on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/eiffel-65/chart-history/billboard-200/song/173982|title=Eiffel 65 Europop Chart History|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-06-05}}</ref> and in the Billboard Canadian Albums.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/eiffel-65/chart-history/canadian-albums/song/384264|title=Eiffel 65 Europop Chart History|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-06-05}}</ref> "[[Blue (Da Ba Dee)]]" peaked at number 6 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]],<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=eiffel 65|chart=all}} Billboard.com - Artist Chart History - Eiffel 65<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> got to 1 in UK<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/blue-(da-ba-dee)/|title=blue (da ba dee) {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|language=en|access-date=2018-06-05}}</ref> and in Germany<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/Eiffel+65/single|title=Die ganze Musik im Internet: Charts, Neuerscheinungen, Tickets, Genres, Genresuche, Genrelexikon, Künstler-Suche, Musik-Suche, Track-Suche, Ticket-Suche - musicline.de|last=GmbH|first=musicline.de / PhonoNet|website=Musicline.de|language=de|access-date=2018-06-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206033727/http://www.musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/EIFFEL+65/single|archive-date=2008-12-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> and to number 3 in Italian charts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hitparadeitalia.it/indici/per_interprete/ae.htm|title=Hit Parade Italia - Indice per Interprete: E|website=Hitparadeitalia.it|access-date=2018-06-05}}</ref> Their second album, [[Contact!]] was released in 2001, with "'80s Stars" peaking at #9 in Italy. A self-titled album was released in 2003.

Eiffel 65 also remixed, between 1999 and 2002, other artists' tracks, like "[[The Bad Touch]]"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/it/The-Bloodhound-Gang-The-Bad-Touch-Remixes/release/1221584|title=The Bloodhound Gang* - The Bad Touch (Remixes)|website=Discogs.com|language=it|access-date=2018-06-05}}</ref> by [[Bloodhound Gang]], [[Nek]]'s hit single "[[La vita è]],” and [[S Club|S Club 7]]'s "Reach"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/it/S-Club-7-Reach/release/2123422|title=S Club 7 - Reach|website=Discogs.com|language=it|access-date=2018-06-05}}</ref> and in early 2005 a remix of Yo Yo Mundi's "L'ultimo testimone.”<ref>{{Citation|last=Yo Yo Mundi|title=Yo Yo Mundi (remixed by Eiffel 65) - L'Ultimo Testimone|date=2007-08-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2dMZtkYleQ|access-date=2018-06-05}}</ref>

===Bloom 06===
[[File:Gabry Ponte @ Troppifiky Bellaria.jpg|thumb|DJ [[Gabry Ponte]]]]
In early March 2005, the group's DJ, [[Gabry Ponte]], left to focus on his solo career. On 16 May 2005, the remaining members, [[Maurizio Lobina]] and [[Jeffrey Jey]], decided to leave [[Bliss Team|Bliss Corporation]] to continue with their own production company. Since the name "Eiffel 65" was a property of Bliss Corporation, the duo decided to continue under a new name, as announced in June 2005, [[Bloom 06]].

Eiffel 65's long anticipated fourth album, under the working title ''Crash Test'', had already finished production by the time of Maury and Jeffrey's departure from Bliss Corporation. It was renamed ''[[Crash Test 01]]'' and was released by Bloom 06 on 13 October 2006. The album contains lyrics in [[English language|English]] and [[Italian language|Italian]].

===Reunion===
[[File:Eiffel 65 live in Belgium 2.jpg|thumb|Lead singer [[Jeffrey Jey]] and keyboardist [[Maurizio Lobina]] performing at [[Ethias Arena]], [[Hasselt]], in April 2013]]
Bliss Corporation confirmed that a new Eiffel 65 lineup would make their debut in the summer of 2007 but the debut was postponed. In 2009, Bliss Corporation began to promote work from older bands by subtitling music videos and releasing "unseen" video footage from Eiffel 65. In June 2010, it was announced on the Bloom 06 website that Eiffel 65 would reunite once again to produce new music as well as touring.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bloom06.com/site/index.php |title=bloom06.com |publisher=bloom06.com |access-date=2012-05-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211203000/http://www.bloom06.com/site/index.php |archive-date=2012-02-11 }}</ref>  In an April 2012 interview, Jeffrey Jey commented on the progress of the new album:
 
{{quote|The progress is slow because we work in three different place and of all the demos probably two, maybe three of these songs are what we call "the candidates" for our new single. We're not able to get a unanimous decision on one song, so that is what's making the release continuously slide. It's really hard to say when we will release a new song. Hopefully within the next two or three months we will be fixing the songs that we think are the good candidates and putting them online.<ref name="April interview">{{cite web |title=IlTedesco, Eiffel65's forum Mod, made an interview with Jeffrey Jey |url=http://www.eiffel65.com/index.php/eiffel65/comments/iltedesco_eiffel65s_forum_mod_made_an_interview_with_jeffrey_jey/ |publisher=Bliss Corporation |access-date=25 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701021358/http://www.eiffel65.com/index.php/eiffel65/comments/iltedesco_eiffel65s_forum_mod_made_an_interview_with_jeffrey_jey |archive-date=1 July 2012 }}</ref> }}

In the meantime they toured Europe with their New Planet Tour, a multimedia show with wide screens and in the summer of 2012, they announced a mini tour in Australia on their site. The band is currently touring, mainly in Italy and occasionally in the rest of Europe and the world.<ref name="touring1">{{cite web|url=http://eiffel65.com/|title=Eiffel 65 - New Planet Tour|publisher=Official Eiffel 65 Website|access-date=20 January 2014}}</ref><ref name="touring2">{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/eiffel65/app_123966167614127|title=Eiffel 65 - New Planet Tour Schedule|publisher=Facebook|access-date=20 January 2014}}</ref>

On 2 April 2016, a demo of Eiffel 65's new single "Panico" was posted on Bliss Corporation's [[YouTube]] channel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eiffel65 - "Panico" ( Rough Mix Demo Version) [Lyrics Video]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJY1-9PTG-k|access-date=3 April 2016}}</ref> "[https://itunes.apple.com/it/album/panico-radio-cut-single/1118474192 Panico]" and its English version "[https://itunes.apple.com/it/album/critical-radio-cut-single/1118472790 Critical]" were officially released on iTunes on 1 June 2016. However, their fourth album release date is still unknown.

==Zorotl==
"Zorotlekuykauo Sushik IV "Zorotl""<ref>{{Cite web|title = Zorotl Official Website|url = http://zorotl.com/the_crew.php|website = zorotl.com|access-date = 2015-11-03}}</ref> is a character created by the Bliss Corporation and featured in the videos of "Blue (Da Ba Dee)," "Move Your Body," and "[[Lucky (In My Life)]]." Zorotl was supposed to be a malicious character but since he was designed with a funny round body, the authors of the "Blue (Da Ba Dee)" video decided to portray it as tender, changing the script and giving it a happy ending.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://zorotl.com/the_crew.php|title=Zorotl Official Website|last=Gianotti|first=Celestino|website=Zorotl.com|access-date=2017-02-25}}</ref> In 2000, Bliss Corporation made a video for the unreleased Eiffel 65 song "I Wanna Be." An alpha version of the video appeared as enhanced content for Eiffel 65's single "[[Too Much of Heaven]]". The song is credited to Zorotl even though it was recorded by members of Eiffel 65, so Zorotl is considered a [[Virtual band|virtual group]].
