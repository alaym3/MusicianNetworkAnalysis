'''108''' is an American hardcore band founded in 1991. Their music reflects the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] faith of the band members.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-06-26|title=Hare Krishnacore - An introduction to the most improbable punk subculture ever|url=https://thevinylfactory.com/features/hare-krishnacore-an-introduction-to-the-most-improbable-punk-subculture-ever/|access-date=2020-12-01|website=The Vinyl Factory|language=en-US}}</ref> 

== History ==
After splitting from the [[Zack De La Rocha]]-fronted band [[Inside Out (band)|Inside Out]], guitarist and Hare Krishna devotee Vraja Kishor das (aka [[Vic DiCara]]) formed 108 in 1991. While recording an EP, Rasaraja dasa (aka Rob Fish) joined on vocals. Following in the footsteps of the [[Cro-Mags]] and Antidote, they made sure to place their [[Krishna Consciousness]] at the forefront of their music.<ref name="krishnacore">{{cite web|title=Hare Krishna Hard Core |url=http://krishnacore.com/articles_interviews/articles/spin_krishnacore_article.html |publisher=krishnacore.com |access-date=March 15, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819144048/http://krishnacore.com/articles_interviews/articles/spin_krishnacore_article.html |archive-date=August 19, 2011 }}</ref>

Their first records, ''Holyname'' and ''Songs of Separation'', were released on [[Equal Vision Records]]. These releases were followed by their participation in two documentary films, 108: The Final Tour<ref name="krishnacore2">{{cite web|title=Biography |url=http://krishnacore.com/biographies/108_bio.html |publisher=krishnacore.com |access-date=March 15, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819144150/http://krishnacore.com/biographies/108_bio.html |archive-date=August 19, 2011 }}</ref> and [[N.Y.H.C. (film)|N.Y.H.C.]]

Following a prolonged break-up where DiCara relocated to [[India]] to become a [[monk]], they planned to reform at [[Hellfest (punk festival)|Hellfest]] in 2005. Due to legal issues, that festival was cancelled at the last moment but 108 successfully re-booked special gigs in [[Philadelphia]]. They self-released a collection of demos and b-sides followed by a new full-length recording entitled "A New Beat From a Dead Heart" with Deathwish Inc.<ref name="allmusic">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p206076/biography|pure_url=yes}} allmusic (((108 > Biography)))<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On March 23, 2010, before the release of ''[[18.61]]'', it was announced that Rob Fish had quit the band, discontent with the band not being able to "redefine" its ties to faith.<ref>[http://lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=14196 108 singer quits, band breaks up] Retrieved Tuesday, March 23, 2010 8:32&nbsp;AM</ref> (Rob and Vic were no longer part of [[ISKCON]] by the time of the bands reformation.<ref name="blogspot">{{cite web|url=http://i-integral.blogspot.com/2008/01/interview-hardcore-band-108.html |title=i.Integral: interview: Hardcore band "108" <!--########## The Heat fanzine, as reprinted #########--> |publisher=i-integral.blogspot.com|access-date=March 15, 2016}}</ref>)  The remaining members of the group later released the following statement: "108 has not broken up. Rasaraja [aka Robert Fish] has left the band, but 108 will continue in full force with a new direction and focus. We will be writing, recording and playing shows this year to support ''18.61'' and create new music."<ref name="lambgoat">{{cite web|url=http://lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=14245 |title=108 not breaking up?|publisher=lambgoat.com|access-date=March 15, 2016}}</ref>

Rob Fish rejoined the band in September 2010.<ref name="lambgoat2">{{cite web|url=http://lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=15142 |title=108 singer re-joins band|publisher=lambgoat.com|access-date=March 15, 2016}}</ref>

In May 2016, the band would embark on a series of reunion shows. May 21 in Flemington, NJ marked the return of Kate "Kate-08" Reddy. This was the first time she had played with the band in 20 years.
