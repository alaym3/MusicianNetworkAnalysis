'''Kenneth Bron''' (born 1 November 1961), known professionally as '''Kenny B''', is a [[Suriname]]se reggae singer who lives in the Netherlands.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Donkers|first1=Sander|title=Kenny B zingt de mensen bij elkaar|url=https://www.vn.nl/kenny-b-zingt-de-mensen-bij-elkaar/|website=[[Vrij Nederland]]|accessdate=25 January 2016|date=19 May 2015|language=Dutch|archive-date=30 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130203129/https://www.vn.nl/kenny-b-zingt-de-mensen-bij-elkaar/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Biography==
Bron, a former servant of the [[Surinamese army]], is inspired by [[Bob Marley]]. He began his career in English and [[Sranan Tongo|Sranan]] before being persuaded to sing in Dutch.   
Kenny B signed to the [[TopNotch]]-label and released his album ''[[Kenny B (album)|Kenny B]]'' in May 2015. It topped the [[Dutch Album Chart]] for one week.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kenny B – Kenny B|url=http://dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Kenny+B&titel=Kenny+B&cat=a|website=Dutch Charts|accessdate=25 January 2016|language=Dutch|archive-date=14 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160214033808/http://www.dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Kenny+B&titel=Kenny+B&cat=a|url-status=live}}</ref> The second single ''Parijs'' chronicled a by-chance-meeting with a Dutch girl in Paris who barely speaks French. It spent seven weeks on top of the [[Dutch Top 40]] chart and gave rise to parody-versions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kenny B – Parijs|url=http://www.top40.nl/kenny-b-1/parijs-1_25594|accessdate=25 January 2016|language=Dutch|archive-date=9 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309001743/http://www.top40.nl/kenny-b-1/parijs-1_25594|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2016, Kenny B recorded two collaboration-singles; one with rapper/tv-presenter [[Ali B]] and R&B-singer [[Brace (singer)|Brace]], the other, a translated cover-version of ''[[54-46 That's My Number]]'' with established pop/reggae-band [[Doe Maar]]. He also provided the Dutch voice of Tamatoa in the ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]''-movie and wrote a song for children's choir ''[[Kinderen voor Kinderen]]''. 

In 2017, Kenny B participated in the tv-contest ''[[De beste zangers van Nederland|Beste Zangers]]'' (''Best Singers'').

Kenny B performs in and outside Dutch-speaking countries, and is a [[copyright]]-ambassador for other Surinamese artists. In 2019 he released the follow-up to his self-titled album and had his tenth no.1-hit on Surinamese station [[Radio 10 Magic FM]].
