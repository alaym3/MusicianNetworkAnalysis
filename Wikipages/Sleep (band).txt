'''Sleep''' is an American [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[San Jose, California]]. The band earned critical and record label attention early in its career. Critic Eduardo Rivadavia describes them as "perhaps the ultimate [[stoner rock]] band"<ref>{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=sleep-mn0000021578|pure_url=no|tab=biography}}</ref> and notes they exerted a strong influence on metal in the 1990s. However, conflict with its record company contributed to Sleep's breakup by the end of the decade. The band reformed in 2009 and has played sporadic live dates internationally since. In 2018, Sleep released their comeback album, ''[[The Sciences (album)|The Sciences]]'', on [[Third Man Records]], to critical acclaim.<ref name="MC1">{{cite web|title=The Sciences by Sleep|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/the-sciences/sleep|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=April 24, 2018}}</ref>

==History==
===Early years===
Sleep evolved in the early 1990s from the band [[Asbestosdeath]], which was established by vocalist/bassist [[Al Cisneros]], drummer [[Chris Hakius]], and guitarist Tom Choi. Asbestosdeath expanded to a quartet with the introduction of [[Matt Pike]] on guitar, and recorded two singles - "Dejection" for [[Profane Existence]] and the self-released "Unclean". Choi departed, and later founded Operator Generator, It Is I, Noothgrush, and Las Vegas' Black Jetts. Asbestosdeath recruited [[Justin Marler]] as replacement and the band adopted the new name, Sleep.

===Recording era===
Their debut album ''[[Volume One (Sleep album)|Volume One]]'' was released in 1991. Frequently compared to bands like [[Saint Vitus (band)|Saint Vitus]], Sleep soon gained a devoted fanbase within the developing [[doom metal]] scene. Marler quit the band soon after to take up life as a [[monk]], leaving the band as a power trio for the recording of their ''[[Volume Two (EP)|Volume Two]]'' EP, which was released officially by Off the Disk Records in 1991.

The band's next album was sent to the independent label Earache as a demo. Recorded at Razors Edge studios in San Francisco, with Billy Anderson as engineer, the tape showcased Sleep's love of all things retro, from the blatant [[Black Sabbath]]/[[Blue Cheer]] influences, to their fixation with 1970's-style tube amplification.<ref name="LarkinHM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Heavy Metal]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1995|edition=Second|isbn=0-85112-656-1|page=331}}</ref> The label immediately signed the band and released the tape exactly as it was received.

''[[Sleep's Holy Mountain]]'' (1992) is widely considered the seminal album in the evolution of stoner metal.<ref name="LarkinHM"/> The album's release was followed by a potentially lucrative offer from [[London Records]], and Sleep signed with them. Around this time, Earache released its first Black Sabbath tribute album, and Sleep contributed a cover of "[[Snowblind (Black Sabbath song)|Snowblind]]".<ref name="LarkinHM"/>

Under their new contract, Sleep began work on its third album, ''[[Dopesmoker]]'', in 1995.<ref name="LarkinHM"/> Much to the dismay of executives at London Records, ''Dopesmoker'' was a single song, over an hour long. London Records declared the album unmarketable and refused to release it. They had it remixed, cut up into sections by David Sardy, which led to a deadlock with the band, Sleep being unhappy with the result. Frustrated and generally unhappy with the situation, the members of Sleep decided to disband.

===After Sleep===
In 1998, Sleep released ''[[Jerusalem (Sleep album)|Jerusalem]]'' as an "official bootleg". One year later, ''Jerusalem'' was given an official legitimate release by [[The Music Cartel]] in the US and [[Rise Above Records]] in Europe.

Finally, in 2003 the original version of ''[[Dopesmoker]]'' was officially released by [[Tee Pee Records]]. It is generally considered the definitive version of the album. An excerpted version can be heard on [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s ''[[Broken Flowers]]'' original soundtrack.

[[Image:Pike.jpg|thumb|right|[[Matt Pike]] is also the frontman of the band [[High on Fire]].]]
Cisneros and Hakius later formed the [[doom metal]] band [[Om (band)|Om]] while Pike formed [[sludge metal]] band [[High on Fire]].

In 2007 a CD compilation of both 7-inch releases of the pre-Sleep band Asbestosdeath was released on [[Southern Lord]] Records.

===Reunion and ''The Sciences''===
In May 2009, Sleep reformed to perform two exclusive reunion sets in Britain as part of the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] music festival. In the shows the band performed for the first time an unheard song that had been written during the ''Dopesmoker'' recording sessions, which was titled "Antarcticans Thawed."<ref name="obelisk1">{{cite web|last=Koczan|first=JJ|title=Saturday Sleep In: "Antarcticans Thawed" Live at ATP 2009|url=http://theobelisk.net/obelisk/tag/sleep-antarcticans-thawed/|access-date=April 22, 2018|work=The Obelisk}}</ref>

After the band's initial reunion performance, original drummer Chris Hakius decided to retire from music to raise a family, and he was replaced on drums by [[Jason Roeder]] of experimental metal band [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/features/sleep/interview/44104/|title=Sleep: Interview|first=Max|last=Burke|website=Prefixmag.com|access-date=December 20, 2018}}</ref> The reconfigured lineup played the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|ATP New York 2010]] music festival in Monticello, New York, where it performed ''Holy Mountain'' in its entirety. The band followed up this performance with a tour of the rest of the United States, playing headlining dates and festivals, through September.

From 2010 onward, Sleep performed similar sporadic festival and touring engagements when the member's otherwise busy touring schedules permitted. In late 2012, in conjunction with an upcoming appearance at [[Maryland Deathfest]], the band stated that it considers Sleep to be a "full, reunited band."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ghettoblastermagazine.com/2012/sleep-announce-that-theyre-fully-reunited/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 25, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141203060414/http://ghettoblastermagazine.com/2012/sleep-announce-that-theyre-fully-reunited/ |archive-date=December 3, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  In 2014, Al Cisneros announced in an interview that the band was working on a new record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/sleep-are-working-on-a-new-record|title=SLEEP Are Working On A New Record|date=January 3, 2014}}</ref> On July 21, 2014, a new song titled "[[The Clarity]]" was released via Adult Swim Singles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://video.adultswim.com/music/singles-2014/|title=Adult Swim Shows|website=Adult Swim}}</ref>

In November 2017 the band members posted a message in [[Morse code]] stating that they had almost finished recording material for a new album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://weedian.com/|title=WEEDIAN.COM – The official site of the band SLEEP|website=Weedian.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/sleep-reveals-its-working-with-neurosiss-keyboardist-via-morse-code|title=SLEEP Reveals It's Working With NEUROSIS's Keyboardist Via Morse Code|date=April 12, 2017|website=Metalinjection.net}}</ref> On April 19, 2018, the band announced ''[[The Sciences (album)|The Sciences]]'', their first album in nearly 20 years, to be released the next day on [[Third Man Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/sleep-announce-first-new-album-in-over-a-decade/|title=Sleep Release First New Album in Over a Decade|website=Pitchfork.com|date=April 19, 2018}}</ref> The release of ''[[The Sciences (album)|The Sciences]]'' was a surprise, being released the day after it was announced, and created a lot of excitement within their fanbase. The album's release date, April 20, 2018, was also [[Record Store Day]] weekend. [[Third Man Records]] released a limited edition split-colored vinyl with an alternate cover to be sold at a limited number of record stores in the US on the release date.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sleep Releases First New Album Since 1998 |url=https://thirdmanrecords.com/news/sleep-releases-first-new-album-since-1998/ |website=Third Man Records |access-date=November 12, 2018}}</ref> The album was met with critical acclaim. ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' wrote in their review, "[The Sciences] makes everything that was originally great about Sleep even better."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Haver Currin |first1=Grayson |title=Sleep: The Sciences Album Review |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sleep-the-sciences/ |website=Pitchfork.com |access-date=November 12, 2018}}</ref> ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' declared that the record gives "stoner-metal acolytes a bonafide miracle."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Camp |first1=Zoe |title=Review: Sleep - 'The Sciences' |url=https://www.spin.com/2018/04/sleep-the-sciences-review/ |website=Spin |date=April 24, 2018 |access-date=November 12, 2018}}</ref>

On May 23, 2018, Sleep released a new song titled "[[Leagues Beneath]]" through Adult Swim Singles and Third Man Records.

On November 11, 2019, the band announced an indefinite hiatus.

==Style==
Musically, Sleep's sound has been characterized as [[stoner rock]] built upon slow, [[Down-tuned guitar|down-tuned]] bass playing alongside similarly low guitar [[riff]]s. Repetition is frequently employed, working to create a "hypnotic state" supplemented by Al Cisneros' vocals.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}

Sleep has used [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]-influenced imagery since the release of their second album, often delivered in a "quasi-religious" manner.<ref name="quietus1">{{cite web|last=Franklin|first=Dan|title=Sleep – The Sciences|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/24429-sleep-the-sciences-review|work=[[The Quietus]]|access-date=January 31, 2019}}</ref> In an interview about the making of ''Dopesmoker'', [[Matt Pike]] acknowledged that the band spent "a lot" of their label advance on cannabis, and "a lot of time."{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Pike also said that about $75,000 was spent on customized amplifiers so the album would have numerous tone layers. He said the songwriting process for ''Dopesmoker'' was long, with the band "working on [the song] for like four years."<ref>Bennett, 2009. p. 294</ref> Al Cisneros stated that smoking cannabis was vital to the song's creative process: "I was really dependent on the space I got into when I was using it [...] The line, 'Drop out of life [with bong in hand],' was kind of a creed at that point."<ref>Bennett, 2009. p. 295</ref>

Their record ''The Sciences'' makes multiple allusions to [[Black Sabbath]], whose sound heavily inspired Sleep. [[Tony Iommi]] is referenced in the lyrics of "Marijuanaut's Theme",<ref>{{cite web|last=Sodomsky|first=Sam|title=Sleep – 'Marijuanaut's Theme'|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/sleep-marijuanauts-theme/|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=January 31, 2019}}</ref> and the song "Giza Butler" is a play on the city [[Giza]] and the name of Black Sabbath's bassist, [[Geezer Butler]].<ref name="quietus1" /> Also in "Giza Butler", references are made to several things in [[Frank Herbert]]'s 1965 novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', including the [[gom jabbar]] (referred to as the "bong jabbar") and [[Muad'Dib]] (as "Muad'Doob").<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=The Sciences |type=vinyl liner notes |others=Sleep |year=2018 |publisher=[[Third Man Records]] |id=TMR 547}}</ref>
