==Biography==
Ted Joyner and Grant Widmer were co-founders of [[The Eames Era]], a [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]]-based indie rock band whose song, "Could Be Anything," was featured on the ''[[Grey's Anatomy (soundtrack)|Grey's Anatomy]]'' soundtrack.<ref name="advocate">{{cite news | url=http://www.2theadvocate.com/entertainment/53837042.html?c=1278196232828 | title=Generationals building on Eames Era | date=2009-08-21 | accessdate=2011-01-27 | last=Wirt | first=John | newspaper=[[The Advocate (Louisiana)|The Advocate]]}}</ref>  
The band broke up when three members decided they no longer wanted to pursue careers as musicians.<ref name="advocate" /> The remaining members, Joyner and Widmer, formed a new band called the Generationals, so named because as they often watched [[CNN]]'s coverage of the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]] as they recorded, the pair noticed that nearly every issue was dubbed a generational issue.<ref name="austin">{{cite news | url=http://www.austin360.com/music/generational-tunes-66676.html | title=Generational Tunes | date=2009-11-17 | accessdate=2011-01-27 | last=Caldwell | first=Patrick | newspaper=[[Austin American-Statesman]]}}</ref>

Generationals released their debut album ''Con Law'' in July 2009 on the [[Park the Van]] label.  Joyner and Widmer wrote the music and recorded the album with studio manager Dan Black.<ref name="spinner">{{cite web | url=http://www.spinner.com/2010/03/12/generationals-interview-sxsw-2010/ | title=Generationals Interview: SXSW 2010 | publisher=[[Spinner.com]] ([[AOL]]) | date=2010-03-12 | accessdate=2011-01-26 | last=Nurrahmah | first=Rika}}</ref> 
Mark Deming of [[Allmusic]] said the album's songs "are good enough to not suffer in comparison to the vintage acts they so clearly love, and that's why this debut is worthwhile, even if you're not nostalgic for the era of the sideways haircut."<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web | archive-date=2013-03-07 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307154056/http://www.allmusic.com/album/con-law-mw0001326658 | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/con-law-mw0001326658 | title=''Con Law'' - Generationals - Review | publisher=[[Allmusic]] ([[Rovi Corporation]]) | accessdate=2011-01-26 | last=Deming | first=Mark | url-status=dead}}</ref> 
Andy Gensler of ''[[T (New York Times)|T: The New York Times Style Magazine]]'' called the album a "delectable debut" that "shimmers with the music of the [[British Invasion]], [[Stax Records|Stax]] soul, [[Wall of Sound]] production, 1950s [[doo-wop]] and California-dreaming jangle filtered through a contemporary indie-rock lens."<ref name="nytimes">{{cite web | url=http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/13/the-nifty-50-generationals-musicians/ | title=The Nifty 50 - Generationals, Musicians | publisher=[[T (New York Times)|T: The New York Times Style Magazine]] ([[The New York Times]]) | date=2010-01-13 | accessdate=2011-01-26 | last=Gensler | first=Andy}}</ref> 
[[Spin (magazine)|''Spin'']]'s Jon Young said that although the duo's "cheery facade ultimately doesn't overcome the gnawing desperation, ''Con Law'' is good, neurotic fun."<ref name="spin">{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Jon|date=September 2009|title=Reviews - Albums|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|publisher=SPIN Media LLC|volume=25|issue=9|page=80|issn=0886-3032}}<!--| accessdate=2011-01-26--></ref> 
In a review of the band's song "When They Fight, They Fight," Zach Kelly of [[Pitchfork Media]] said of the band's style: "It comes as kind of a pleasant surprise to hear a band from N.O. sound this bright and enraptured in life's simple joys. But man, does this thing flirt with overdoing it."<ref name="pitchfork">{{cite web
