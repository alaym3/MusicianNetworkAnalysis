'''The Floaters''' were an American [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] [[vocal group]], from the [[Sojourner Truth Project|Sojourner Truth housing projects]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], that formed in 1976. The group are best known for their 1977 song "[[Float On (The Floaters song)|Float On]]", which reached No. 2 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], No. 1 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], and No. 5 on the [[Irish Singles Chart]].

==Career==
The band was formed by the former [[Detroit Emeralds]]' singer James Mitchell, with his brother Paul Mitchell, Larry Cunningham, Charles Clark, and the unrelated Ralph Mitchell.<ref name="LarkinSM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Soul Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-733-9|page=88}}</ref><ref name="AllMusic">{{cite web |last1=Wynn|first1=Ron|title=Artist Biography|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/floaters-mn0000762034/biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=27 September 2021}}</ref> Most of The Floaters were from Northeast Detroit, bordering [[Hamtramck]] on Detroit's Eastside.

James Mitchell wrote the band's one major hit, "[[Float On (The Floaters song)|Float On]]", with Arnold Ingram and Marvin Willis. The lyrics spotlight each member of the band, who introduced themselves with their name, [[astrology|astrological]] sign, and ideal type of romantic partner.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/float-on-mt0003720545|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|first=Ed|last=Hogan|title=Float On - Floaters: Song Review}}</ref> The song was [[record producer|produced]] by Woody Wilson. It became a worldwide hit in 1977 on [[ABC Records]], reaching No. 1 on the [[United States|US]] [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] chart, No. 2 on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 [[record chart|chart]],<ref name="LarkinSM"/> and No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart (for a single week in August that year).<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book|first=David|last=Roberts|year=2006|title=British Hit Singles & Albums|edition=19th|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|location=London|isbn=1-904994-10-5|page=206}}</ref>

Follow-ups such as "[[You Don't Have to Say You Love Me]]" (No. 28 [[Billboard R&B chart|''Billboard'' R&B]] chart) were not as successful.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> The group continued to record, releasing four studio albums over the next few years.

A new recording of the song "Float On" was recorded in 2001 for the album, ''Still Standing'', by the group [[Full Force]]<ref name="AMG"/> and [[Cheech & Chong]] did a take-off of the song called "Bloat On".  The rap group [[Stetsasonic]] also did a cover of the song on ''[[In Full Gear]]'' (1988).  The characters from ''[[Sesame Street]]'', David ([[Northern Calloway]]), Bob ([[Bob McGrath]]), Gordon ([[Roscoe Orman]]) and Luis ([[Emilio Delgado]]) did a parody of the song called "Gimmie Five". British parody group [[The Barron Knights]] included a parody of "Float On" in their 1977 hit "Live in Trouble".

This song was also sampled by Canadian hip-hop recording duo [[Dream Warriors (band)|Dream Warriors]], in their song of the same name.

Larry Cunningham (born on June 23, 1951) died on January 10, 2019, at the age of 67.<ref name= celebrityaccess>{{cite web|url=https://celebrityaccess.com/2019/01/11/the-floaters-singer-larry-cunningham-dies/ |title= The Floaters Singer Larry Cunningham Dies|website=Celebrityaccess.com|access-date= January 11, 2019}}</ref><ref name= dignitymemorial>{{cite web|url=https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/tucson-az/larry-cunningham-8122191 |title= Obituary Larry Cunningham |website=Dignitymemorial.com|access-date= January 13, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title="Float On" singer Larry Cunningham of The Floaters dies |url=https://www.soultracks.com/story-larry-cunningham-dies|website=Soul Tracks|access-date=27 September 2021|date=January 10, 2019}}</ref>
