'''Sugar Ray''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Newport Beach, California]], in 1986. Originally playing heavier [[nu metal]] style music, the band achieved mainstream popularity in 1997 with their more [[pop music|pop]]-influenced single "[[Fly (Sugar Ray song)|Fly]]". The song's success led the band to shift its style dramatically to the more radio-friendly pop sound with their subsequent releases. Their best-selling album, ''[[14:59]]'', was released in 1999, and featured popular singles "[[Every Morning (Sugar Ray song)|Every Morning]]", "[[Someday (Sugar Ray song)|Someday]]", followed by a [[Sugar Ray (album)|self-titled album]] in 2001 featuring the single "[[When It's Over (Sugar Ray song)|When It's Over]]". The band would release two further albums, ''[[In the Pursuit of Leisure]]'' (2003) and ''[[Music for Cougars]]'' (2009), though the albums and respective singles generally sold far less. The band continued to tour into the 2010s.

In 2019, ten years after the band's last album, they announced their seventh studio album, ''Little Yachty'', in June 2019. The lead single, "Make It Easy", was released the same month.

==History==

===Formation and ''Lemonade and Brownies'' (1986–96)===
The band members grew up in Orange County. [[Rodney Sheppard]] played in a number of reggae bands, including working with future [[Good Charlotte]] drummer [[Dean Butterworth]]. In the late 1980s, prior to Sugar Ray, Sheppard and [[Stan Frazier (musician)|Stan Frazier]] played together in a band under the name The Tories. Later additions Murphy Karges and [[Mark McGrath]] changed the band's name to Shrinky Dinx – they were initially named Shrinky Dinks.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/25-worst-original-names-of-famous-bands-72260/the-shrinky-dinks-44994/|title=25 Worst Original Names of Famous Bands|date=July 22, 2015|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=May 30, 2019}}</ref> After signing with [[Atlantic Records]], the name was changed to Sugar Ray upon threat of a lawsuit from the [[Milton Bradley Company]], maker of the [[Shrinky Dinks]] toy.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p294514|pure_url=yes}}|title=Sugar Ray – Biography|last=Huey|first=Steve|year=2002|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2009-01-18}}</ref>

The band's debut album, ''[[Lemonade and Brownies]]'', was released in 1995 and though it failed to produce a major [[hit single]] it did earn them recognition in alternative circles.

After they gained fame with the 1997 album ''Floored'' in 1998, the single "Speed Home California" and "Mean Machine" from ''Lemonade and Brownies'' was featured in the [[PlayStation]] game ''[[Road Rash 3D]]'', and its [[Nintendo 64]] counterpart ''[[Road Rash 64]]'', respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/09/30/road-rash-64|title=Road Rash 64|work=IGN|access-date=April 30, 2015}}</ref>

===''Floored'' (1997–98)===
Sugar Ray's first mainstream hit came in the summer of 1997 with their song "[[Fly (Sugar Ray song)|Fly]]", which was released from the album ''[[Floored]]'' and featured [[reggae]] musician [[Super Cat]]. "Fly" did not sound anything at all like the rest of the tracks on the album and received frequent radio play, resulting in a number one rank on the Billboard's Airplay List. As a result of the success of "Fly", ''Floored'' sold well and was [[RIAA certification|certified]] double platinum. However, by the end of 1997, critics were skeptical that Sugar Ray could put out another successful song and labeled them a [[one-hit wonder]].<ref name="allmusic"/>  The same year, Sugar Ray was featured in the movie ''[[Fathers' Day (1997 film)|Father's Day]],'' starring [[Billy Crystal]] and [[Robin Williams]].

===''14:59'' (1999–2000)===
Their 1999 album ''[[14:59]]'' was the band's reply to suggestions that they were a one-hit wonder, with the title implying that their [[15 minutes of fame]] were not quite up — their "fame clock" read 14:59.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1434704/19990126/sugar_ray.jhtml|title=Sugar Ray Coasts Low-Riding Groove For "Every Morning"|date=1999-01-26|publisher=MTV News|access-date=2009-01-18}}</ref>  "[[Every Morning (Sugar Ray song)|Every Morning]]", which was widely compared to "Fly", had similar success during the spring of 1999, reaching number 3 on the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]]. Their follow-up [[single (music)|single]] "[[Someday (Sugar Ray song)|Someday]]" also enjoyed extensive airplay later that year and reached number 7 in the U.S. The next follow-up single "Falls Apart (Run Away)" reached number 29 in early 2000. ''14:59'' outsold its predecessor and was certified triple platinum. The band toured in support of the album, and were scheduled to perform at [[Woodstock 99]]. However, Mark fell ill and they had to cancel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mtv.com/news/1434702/sugar-ray-off-woodstock-as-mcgrath-takes-ill/ |title=MTV Article - Sugar Ray at Woodstock 99 |website=MTV|date=1999-07-22 |access-date=2021-10-18}}</ref> After ''14:59'' in 2000, Sugar Ray teamed up with [[The Alkaholiks]] to contribute the track "Make Room" on the Rap Rock collaboration album, ''[[Loud Rocks]]'', with other artists with a similar style such as [[Crazy Town]] and [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]]. In 2000, Sugar Ray did a cover version of [[John Cale]] and [[Brian Eno]]'s song "Spinning Away" for the soundtrack to the film ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]''.

===''Sugar Ray'' (2001–02)===
Their 2001 self-titled album ''[[Sugar Ray (album)|Sugar Ray]]'' produced another hit with "[[When It's Over (Sugar Ray song)|When It's Over]]", which, although it failed to achieve the same level of success as their previous singles, still reached number 13 in the U.S. Other singles such as "[[Answer the Phone]]", "Under the Sun" and "Words to Me" gained some popularity as well. Sugar Ray also made several movie appearances, including ''[[Scooby-Doo (2002 film)|Scooby-Doo]]'' in 2002. <ref>{{Cite web|last=Archive-Joe-DAngelo|title=Sugar Ray Join Shaggy, Scooby On Spooky Island|url=https://www.mtv.com/news/1443359/sugar-ray-join-shaggy-scooby-on-spooky-island/|access-date=2021-10-10|website=MTV News|language=en}}</ref>

===''In the Pursuit of Leisure'' (2003–05)===
Sugar Ray's 2003 effort ''[[In the Pursuit of Leisure]],'' and the first single from the album, "Mr. Bartender (It's So Easy)", received a lukewarm reception.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The album also contained the band's cover of Joe Jackson's famous "[[Is She Really Going Out With Him?]]". ProHoeZak guested live with the band in 2003 having appeared on "Mr. Bartender (It's So Easy)". In 2005, Sugar Ray released a [[The Best of Sugar Ray|greatest hits album]], with three new songs, "Shot of Laughter", "Time After Time", and "Psychedelic Bee".

===Inactivity and ''Music for Cougars'' (2006–09)===
After releasing their greatest hits album – ''The Best of Sugar Ray'', in 2005, the band went into a period of relative inactivity for a number of years, with Mark McGrath starting a new job as an anchor on the television show ''[[Extra (U.S. TV program)|Extra]]''. In January 2006, Sugar Ray was released from their [[recording contract]] with [[Atlantic Records]]. In mid-2007, their previously unreleased song "Into Yesterday" was used on the ''[[Surf's Up (film)|Surf's Up]]'' movie soundtrack, and  the band made brief tour in Asia in August 2007 where they headlined SingFest, Singapore's first international music festival.

Sugar Ray appeared on the May 18, 2008, season 3 finale of ''[[American Dad!]],'' titled "[[Spring Break-Up]]", as themselves, playing "Fly" at a Spring Break party.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

On May 19, 2008, the band announced they would be entering the studio to record their first album of new material since 2003. Jason Bernard, a friend of the band (who also happened to be a music producer) brought them a deal to sign with his label. It was announced that the band signed Pulse Recordings and that the new album should be released in the summer of 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sugarray.wordpress.com/2008/12/10/novemberdecember-update/|title=November/December Update|last=Karges|first=Murphy|date=2008-12-10|work=Sugar Ray Blog|publisher=Wordpress|access-date=2009-01-18|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505185550/http://sugarray.wordpress.com/2008/12/10/novemberdecember-update/|archive-date=May 5, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> On March 6, 2009, Mark McGrath announced that the new album would be titled ''[[Music for Cougars]]''. It was released on July 21, 2009.  The first single was "Boardwalk".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/268739/sugar-ray-returns-with-music-for-cougars |title=Sugar Ray Returns With 'Music For Cougars' |magazine=Billboard |access-date=2014-04-23}}</ref>

Some critics noted that McGrath aimed to lower people's expectations for the album during its promotion by saying things like: "I know people aren't sitting on the edge of their seats waiting for a Sugar Ray album, but that wasn't the point." In another interview, Murphy Karges, bassist said, "We've never had any credibility. Nobody ever gave us any so how could we lose any?"{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Lineup changes and 1990s nostalgia touring (2010–2017)===

On August 22, 2010, Sugar Ray's [[Twitter]] page announced that Craig "DJ Homicide" Bullock had left the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/sugarrayband/status/21814199959 |title=Twitter / Sugar Ray: On behalf of SR family, we |website=Twitter.com |date=2010-08-22 |access-date=2012-04-26}}</ref> In 2011, the band had what McGrath described as not "the highest-grossing year for Sugar Ray". Murphy Karges and Stan Frazier also left, one not wanting to tour anymore, and the other taking a job with [[Aaron Rodgers]]. This left Rodney Sheppard and McGrath as the remaining original members.<ref name="ocregister.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/mcgrath-360467-sugar-ray.html |title=It's been almost a decade since Sugar Ray has |website=Ocregister.com |date=June 23, 2012 |access-date=2014-04-23}}</ref> The band recruited replacements in percussionist Al Keith, bassist Justin Bivona and drummer Jesse Bivona, the latter two being touring support members in the past.<ref name="ocregister.com"/>{{confusing-inline|date=March 2018}} [[File:Sugar Ray at some mall.jpg|thumb|Sugar Ray performing]]

In 2012, McGrath worked with [[Art Alexakis]], frontman and vocalist of the band [[Everclear (band)|Everclear]], on starting up a 1990s nostalgia tour, something they had discussed in the past but had always felt was too soon to be successful.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sean Spillane |url=http://www.ctpost.com/music/article/Sugar-Ray-part-of-Summerland-Tour-coming-to-3732000.php |title=Sugar Ray part of Summerland Tour coming to Mohegan Sun Arena – Connecticut Post |website=Ctpost.com |date=2012-07-24 |access-date=2014-04-23}}</ref> The result was the "Summerland" tour, featuring a line-up of alternative rock bands that "at least had a big hit or two" in the 1990s, containing McGrath and Alexakis's own bands along with [[Marcy Playground]], [[Gin Blossoms]], and [[Lit (band)|Lit]].<ref name="rollingstone.com">{{cite magazine|author=Andy Greene |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/mark-mcgrath-i-understand-why-people-dont-like-me-20130212 |title=Mark McGrath: 'I Understand Why People Don't Like Me' &#124; Music News |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=2013-02-12 |access-date=2014-04-23}}</ref><ref name="alternativeaddiction.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.alternativeaddiction.com/musicnews/article/2771/Looking-Past-Summerland-2012-with-Sugar-Ray-and-Mark-McGrath |title=Looking Past Summerland 2012 with Sugar Ray and Mark McGrath |website=AlternativeAddiction.com |date=2012-09-21 |access-date=2014-04-23}}</ref> Percussionist Al Keith (Khalil Al-Rashad) injured his foot on July 2, 2012 at Del Mar Fairgrounds in Del Mar, California, during the song "Fly." He was absent from shows until August 2012. The tour was deemed a success, and McGrath initially spoke of the possibility of it becoming a yearly event.<ref name="alternativeaddiction.com"/> Initial plans to expand the nostalgia touring into 2013 faced issues. McGrath announced a "Mark McGrath & Friends" tour, in which the band would perform alongside other 1990s alternative rock bands [[Smash Mouth]], [[Spin Doctors]], and [[Vertical Horizon]], on a [[cruise ship]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/mark_mcgrath/status/289092600739282946 |title=Twitter / mark_mcgrath: Happy to announce the Mark |website=Twitter.com |date=2013-01-09 |access-date=2014-04-23}}</ref> though the plans were cancelled, with the idea losing support after the [[Carnival Triumph cruise ship disaster]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://touch.latimes.com/|title=LA Times|website=Webarchive.loc.gov|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121006015957/http://touch.latimes.com/|archive-date=October 6, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Additionally, McGrath and Alexakis did not see eye to eye on the future direction for the "Summerland" tour, leading to Sugar Ray leaving its 2013 incarnation<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Andy Greene |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/2013-summerland-tour-unites-everclear-live-filter-20130325 |title=2013 Summerland Tour Unites Everclear, Live, Filter &#124; Music News |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=2013-03-25 |access-date=2014-04-23}}</ref> in favor of starting their own rival nostalgia tour called "Under the Sun" instead.<ref name="rollingstone.com"/> The tour ran three separate years – 2013, 2014, and 2015.<ref name=rockcellarmagazine/>

As early as 2013, McGrath spoke of recording and releasing an [[extended play|EP]], though at the time, he was unsure if it would be released as a band release or a solo release.<ref name="alternativeaddiction.com"/> On April 9, 2013, Mark McGrath announced via Twitter that he would be "heading to Pulse Recording Studios" to record the new material, he stated July to be a hopeful release date.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/mark_mcgrath/status/321712278489690112 |title=Twitter / mark_mcgrath: Going into Pulse Recording |publisher=Twitter.com |access-date=2014-04-23}}</ref> For the tour, and drummer Jesse Bivona and bassist Justin Bivona were temporarily replaced by drummer [[Dean Butterworth]] and bassist Serg Dimitrijevic, as the Bivona brothers' band The Interrupters are opening for [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]]. On September 9, 2013, former members Stan Frazier (drums, percussion, programming, backing vocals) and Murphy Karges (bass guitar, backing vocals) performed with Scott Foster (lead vocals, guitar), Lewis Richards (guitar, backing vocals), and Damon Tucker (guitar, backing vocals) during Keep Calm and Beat H.E.A.T. Rocking & Rally. They performed some of Foster's solo material, and some Sugar Ray classics. They performed from 5:00&nbsp;p.m. to 8:00&nbsp;p.m. at Twila Reid Park, 3100 West Orange Avenue, Anaheim. On November 9, 2013, Sugar Ray was to play a benefit for the Greater Los Angeles Fisher House

The band continued its "Under the Sun" tour through 2014. However, in June 2014, McGrath revealed that the band had been struggling with legal wranglings with Karges and Frazier since their departure in 2012, and that because of it, he felt there would never be another Sugar Ray album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arena.com/article/mark-mcgrath-stays-fly-carries-the-90s-torch|title=Home – Arena Music|work=arena.com|access-date=April 30, 2015}}</ref> McGrath would later release the EP as a solo EP entitled ''Summertime's Coming'' in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fuse.tv/2015/06/sugar-ray-mark-mcgrath-solo-ep|title=Sugar Ray's Mark McGrath Is Crowdfunding His First Solo EP |website=Fuse.tv|access-date=November 20, 2018}}</ref><ref name="Fuse2017"/> As of the fall of 2014, drummer Jesse Bivona and bassist Justin Bivona are no longer in Sugar Ray (leaving officially in 2016); drummer Dean Butterworth became a full member in fall 2014, while bassist Kristian Attard became a full member in 2016.
