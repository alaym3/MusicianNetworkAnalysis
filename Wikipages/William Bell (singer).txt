'''William Bell''' ([[Birth name|''né'']] '''Yarbrough'''; born July 16, 1939) is an [[United States|American]] [[soul music|soul]] singer and songwriter. As a performer, he is probably best known for his debut single, 1961's "[[You Don't Miss Your Water]]"; 1968's top 10 hit in the UK "[[Private Number (Judy Clay and William Bell song)|Private Number]]", a duet with [[Judy Clay]]; and his only US top 40 hit, 1976's "[[Tryin' to Love Two]]", which also hit No. 1 on the R&B chart. Upon the death of [[Otis Redding]], Bell released the well-received memorial song "A Tribute to a King".

As a songwriter, Bell co-authored the [[Chuck Jackson]] hit "Any Other Way" (which was a cover since Bell issued it first) as a follow-up to "You Don't Miss Your Water"; [[Billy Idol]]'s 1986 hit "[[To Be a Lover]]", which was first a hit for Bell under its original title "I Forgot to Be Your Lover"; and the blues classic "[[Born Under a Bad Sign (song)|Born Under A Bad Sign]]", popularized by both [[Albert King]] and [[Cream (band)|Cream]].

Although he was a long-time recording artist for [[Stax Records]], he is unrelated to the label's one-time president, [[Al Bell]].

In 2017, Bell was awarded a [[Grammy for Best Americana Album]] for his record ''This Is Where I Live''. He performed his hit "Born Under a Bad Sign" alongside [[Gary Clark Jr.]] at the 2017 [[Grammy Award]]s. Bell was also featured on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'s'' "Best of the Grammys" for that year.

His music has been sampled by artists such as [[Kanye West]], [[Ludacris]], and [[Jaheim]].<ref name="About">{{Cite web|url=http://www.williambell.com/about|title=About|website=William Bell}}</ref>

==Career==
Bell was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].<ref name="allmusic1">{{cite web|author=Jason Ankeny |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/william-bell-mn0000578744/biography |title=William Bell &#124; Biography & History |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=1939-07-16 |access-date=2016-10-18}}</ref>  He took the last name "Bell" as a stage name in honor of his grandmother, whose first name was Belle.

Bell sang in church as a child and considered himself a student of [[The Soul Stirrers]], the popular gospel group led by [[Sam Cooke]]. At age ten, he began songwriting with the original composition, "Alone On A Rainy Night". At the age of 14, Bell won a talent contest and began making a name for himself singing in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] area clubs.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bkmag.com/2016/06/02/william-bell-this-is-where-i-live/|title=William Bell On Making The Ballads That Made Him|first=Jonathan|last=Bernstein|date=June 2, 2016|website=[[Brooklyn Magazine]]}}</ref>

He made his first leap into the music scene backing [[Rufus Thomas]]. In 1957, Bell recorded his first sides as a member of the Del Rios,<ref name="allmusic1"/> a teenage vocal group that caught the eye of [[Stax Records]].<ref name="auto"/>

Bell was an early signing on Stax Records initially as a songwriter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.staxrecords.com/artists/ |title=Artists |publisher=[[Stax Records]] |access-date=2016-10-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121020534/http://www.staxrecords.com/artists/ |archive-date=November 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Other notable Stax Records artists include Otis Redding,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.staxrecords.com/artists/otis-redding/ |title=Otis Redding |publisher=[[Stax Records]] |access-date=2016-10-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011163305/http://www.staxrecords.com/artists/otis-redding/ |archive-date=October 11, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Sam and Dave,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.staxrecords.com/artists/sam-dave/ |title=Sam & Dave |publisher=[[Stax Records]] |access-date=2016-10-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011161350/http://www.staxrecords.com/artists/sam-dave/ |archive-date=October 11, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Isaac Hayes,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.staxrecords.com/artists/isaac-hayes/ |title=Isaac Hayes |publisher=[[Stax Records]] |access-date=2016-10-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011161334/http://www.staxrecords.com/artists/isaac-hayes/ |archive-date=October 11, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> and The Staple Singers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.staxrecords.com/artists/the-staple-singers/ |title=The Staple Singers |publisher=[[Stax Records]] |date=2000-12-19 |access-date=2016-10-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011161400/http://www.staxrecords.com/artists/the-staple-singers/ |archive-date=October 11, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Bell was the first male solo act to be signed to Stax Records and he was able to release several singles before joining the military. He continued to record singles while on break from deployment, including the song "Marching Off to War".<ref name="About"/>

It was only after Bell finished his stint in the military that he was finally able to release his debut album,<ref>{{cite web|last=Murray |first=Noel |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/william-bell-the-soul-of-a-bell-16683 |title=William Bell: The Soul Of A Bell · Permanent Records |website=[[The A.V.

Bell was a close friend of fellow Stax recording artist, Otis Redding. Bell was supposed to be on the same tragic 1967 flight that led to Redding's death. "It started snowing so bad in Chicago, the promoter up there canceled my show," recalls Bell. The tragedy led to a collaboration between Bell and [[Booker T. Jones]] (of [[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]]) who Bell knew from high school and church. Bell and Jones released "A Tribute to a King" in honor of Redding and it quickly became a hit.<ref name="consummate soul man">{{Cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/review-at-79-william-bell-proves-to-be-consummate-soul-man-at-the-dakota/490695081/|title=At 79, William Bell proves to be consummate soul man at the Dakota in Minneapolis|website=[[Star Tribune]] |last=Bream |first=Jon |date=August 13, 2018| access-date=July 22, 2019}}</ref>

In 1967, Bell co-wrote an unintended Christmas hit, "Everyday Will Be Like a Holiday". The song remains one of Bell's most recorded hits and serves as a classic R&B [[Christmas song]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/soul-man-william-bell-rides-grammy-winning-comeback-into-minneapolis-and-duluth/490471361/|title=Soul man William Bell rides Grammy-winning comeback into Minneapolis and Duluth|website=Star Tribune}}</ref> In 2017, ''[[Hot Press]]'' magazine named the hit the "Greatest Christmas record of all time".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotpress.com/music/the-greatest-christmas-record-of-them-all-21670996|title=The Greatest Christmas Record Of Them All?|first=Pat|last=Carty|website=[[Hot Press]]}}</ref>

Bell moved to [[Atlanta, Georgia]], in 1969 and started up Peachtree Record Company, his short-lived soul label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/list/paddlesteamer/the_peachtree_record_company_story/ |title=The Peachtree Record Company Story |publisher=[[Rate Your Music]] |access-date=2016-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/88689-William-Bell |title=William Bell Discography |website=Discogs.com |date=1939-07-16 |access-date=2016-10-18}}</ref>

During his time in Atlanta, he took acting lessons and played Stanley Kowalski in a production of ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire]]''.
Bell later signed a two-year deal with [[Mercury Records]] where he released the 1977 single "Trying To Love Two" which hit No.1 on the R&B charts, No. 10 on the pop charts, and sold a million copies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vinylmeplease.com/magazine/soul-william-bell/|title=The Soul Of William Bell|date=March 23, 2018|website=Vinyl Me Please}}</ref>

In 1985, he founded another label, Wilbe, and issued ''Passion'', which found its most receptive audiences in the UK.<ref name="allmusic1"/>

Two years later, Bell was inducted into the [[Georgia Music Hall of Fame]] and received the Rhythm & Blues Foundation's R&B Pioneer Award that same year. Starting in 1992, Bell took a hiatus from the recording studio, while still performing regularly. In 2000, he released an album of all-new material on Wilbe entitled ''A Portrait Is Forever''. In 2003, he was honored with the W.C. Handy Heritage Award. It wasn't until six years after his previous album that he released the album ''New Lease on Life''.

===2010s to present===

In 2016, Bell reactivated the Stax Record Label to release a new album. Produced by John Leventhal, ''[[This Is Where I Live]]'' featured Bell performing a batch of new songs, along with a revived recording of "Born Under a Bad Sign".<ref name="allmusic1"/> In 2017, the album was awarded a Grammy for 'Best Americana Album,'<ref name="auto6">{{Cite web|url=https://theboot.com/william-bell-best-americana-album-2017-grammys-awards/|title=William Bell Wins Best Americana Album at 2017 Grammy Awards|first=Courtney|last=Carr|website=The Boot}}</ref> which took Bell's career to new heights including a featured performance alongside other legendary Stax acts at BBC's ''50 Years of Soul'' event at [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London, UK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/e656q9|title=Prom 65: Stax Records: 50 Years of Soul|website=BBC Music Events}}</ref> Additionally, Bell was one of the final performances at BB King's Blues Club in NYC before it closed in the spring of 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://relix.com/blogs/detail/william_bell_at_bb_kings_a_gallery/|title=William Bell at B.B.
