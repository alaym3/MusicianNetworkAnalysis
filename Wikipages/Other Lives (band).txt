According to their official Facebook page current band members are Jesse Tabish (piano, guitar, lead vocals), Jonathon Mooney (piano, violin, guitar, percussion, trumpet) & Josh Onstott (bass, keys, percussion, guitar, backing vocals)

"For 12" was featured as KCRW's "Today's Top Tune" on October 27, 2010.

Other Lives finished working on their album ''Tamer Animals'' in February 2011. The album was released on May 10, 2011, in the USA and August 29, 2011, in UK/Europe. The album was critically well-received, and [[Thom Yorke]]'s supergroup [[Atoms for Peace (band)|Atoms for Peace]] released a remix of the title track the following year.

In the summer of 2011, the band toured with [[S. Carey]] and [[The Rosebuds]]. Following a month of shows in the UK, the band joined [[Bon Iver]] in September in the USA and Canada and played at [[Iceland Airwaves]] festival. The band returned to the UK in October to support [[Chapel Club]] in London on October 18.  The band opened for [[Radiohead]] on the first leg of their 2012 North American tour in February and March, 2012, and also played [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|2012 Coachella Festival]].<ref name="lineup">{{cite news |last=O'Neal |first=Sean |url= http://www.avclub.com/articles/here-is-this-years-coachella-lineup,67407/ |title=Here is this year's Coachella lineup  |work=[[The A.V. Club]] |date=2012-01-09 |access-date=2012-01-09}}</ref>

In September 2011, Other Lives launched their [[Wirewax]] interactive website,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tameranimals.com |title=Tamer Animals |publisher=Tameranimals.com |access-date=2015-06-06}}</ref> which was built around the band's official video for "For 12", and allowed users to access audio and visual content within the video.

On October 22, 2012, Other Lives' new album, Mind the Gap EP, was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://otherlives.com/post/32717197316 |title=Pitchfork Announces Our Mind The Gap Ep Release |publisher=Otherlives.com |date=2014-09-23 |access-date=2015-06-06}}</ref>

After opening for Radiohead and subsequently headlining their own tour in 2012, the band took a hiatus from performing to work on their upcoming album, "Rituals." Over the next few years, Other Lives released the eponymous "Rituals" and "2 Pyramids" as promotional singles before releasing the album on May 4, 2015. "Rituals" marked a departure from TBD Records, as the band instead released their newest album on the Belgian label [[PIAS Recordings|Play It Again Sam Recordings]] with the help of co-producer and [[Atoms for Peace (band)|Atoms For Peace]] drummer [[Joey Waronker]].<ref name="allmusic.com"/> In a message about the album on their website, front man Jesse Tabish wrote, "We wanted a cleaner, brighter record with more movement and color."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://otherlives.com/post/4247029949/bio |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-07-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629091219/http://otherlives.com/post/4247029949/bio |archive-date=2016-06-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> During the eighteen month period of the album's creation, the group wrote over sixty songs before releasing its current, fourteen track iteration, which runs at fifty-four minutes and eighteen seconds. The album has a notably more somber feel to it than previous works, with [[AllMusic]] describing its sound as "shimmery, meticulously crafted . . . pure pop bliss . . . rooted in darkness."<ref name="allmusic.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/rituals-mw0002821498|title=Rituals - Other Lives &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

In the summer of 2014, [[Shearwater (band)|Shearwater]] drummer Danny Reisch replaced Colby Owens.

The band has spent the summer of 2018 recording a new album in [[Cooper Mountain (Oregon)|Cooper Mountain]], [[Oregon]].  On January 9, 2020, they announced that the album ''For Their Love'' will be released on April 24, 2020.
