==History==
===2006–2011:''The Grey Space'' and ''Inside Story''===
After signing with the [[Elefant Traks]] label, the pair released their debut album ''The Grey Space'', an album created largely during the duo's high school years, at a time where they linked up with Spit Syndicate and Joyride to form the extended One Day crew. Elefant Traks artist and co-founder Urthboy explained the duo's recruitment in a blog post published in the lead-up to the release of Horrorshow's third album:

<blockquote>
When Horrorshow brought me ''The Grey Space'' I deduced that they were fans of [[Atmosphere (music group)|Atmosphere]]. They wouldn’t put "Walk You Home" on it, making the better decision to keep it for their unfinished second album, despite my wishes at the time. The first " we wanna join the Elefants " conversation I had with them took place on the balcony at our studio/office at the time in Enmore. I remember telling them that the only way Elefant Traks could develop was if the likes of Horrorshow took the possibilities opened up by The Herd and amplify them.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fans are just as important as Kings|url=http://urthboy.wordpress.com/2013/07/31/fans-are-just-as-important-as-kings/|work=Smokey's Blog|publisher=Wordpress|accessdate=6 August 2013|author=urthboy|date=31 July 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

''The Grey Space'' was nominated for an award at the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2009]].<ref name="Bris">{{cite web|title=HORRORSHOW|url=http://www.brisbanefestival.com.au/events/view/horrorshow|work=Brisbane Festival|publisher=Brisbane Festival 2012|accessdate=14 September 2012|year=2012}}</ref> The band completed tours with [[The Herd (Australian band)|The Herd]], [[Muph & Plutonic]] and [[Hermitude]].

After the release of their debut followed their second album ''Inside Story'' in 2009, which was acclaimed amongst their fans for its eloquent lyricism and soulful production. It was chosen as a [[Triple J]] Feature Album, [[FBi Radio|FBi]] Album of the Week and was also favourably received by Australian music critics.

===2012–2015: ''King Amongst Many''===
In 2012, Horrorshow again supported the Hilltop Hoods on a European tour and continued in this role for the Hilltop Hoods' "Speaking in Tongues" Australian tour.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hilltop Hoods 'Speaking in Tongues' National Australian Album Tour|url=http://www.liveguide.com.au/Tours/768136/Hilltop_Hoods_Speaking_In_Tongues_National_Australian_Album_Tour|work=Liveguide.com.au|publisher=Liveguide|accessdate=14 September 2012|year=2012}}</ref> The band was included in the line-up for the 2012 Brisbane Festival<ref>{{cite web|title=Horrorshow|url=http://www.brisbanefestivalarchive.com.au/events/view/horrorshow|publisher=Brisbane Festival 2012|accessdate=28 March 2013|year=2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121230070943/http://www.brisbanefestivalarchive.com.au/events/view/horrorshow|archivedate=30 December 2012}}</ref> and performed at the Spiegeltent venue.<ref>{{cite web|title=Horrorshow – Live at the Spiegeltent {{!}} album|url=http://nuerahiphop.blogspot.com/2013/03/horrorshow-live-at-spiegeltent-album.html|work=Australian Hip Hop|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=28 March 2013|format=Audio upload|date=25 March 2013 }}</ref>

An indication of Horrorshow's third album was revealed with a song entitled "Did You Hear?", which features a [[French horn|horns]] section. On 22 December 2012, a confirmation of the third album's 2013 release was posted on the group's Facebook fan page.<ref>{{cite web|title=Horrorshow|url=http://www.elefanttraks.com/artists/horrorshow|publisher=Elefant Traks|accessdate=1 September 2012|author=Elefant Traks|year=2012}}</ref> In early May 2013, another song "Unfair Lottery" was released on the Internet and received radio airplay.
