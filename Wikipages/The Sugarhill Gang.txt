'''The Sugarhill Gang''' is an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] trio. Their 1979 [[hit record|hit]] "[[Rapper's Delight]]" was the first rap [[single (music)|single]] to become a [[top 40]] hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]];<ref>{{cite web|title= 29 Black Music Milestones: Sugarhill Gang |url= https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/473110/29-black-music-milestones-sugarhill-gang-pioneers-hip-hop|website=Billboard.com|access-date=2021-04-22}}</ref> reaching a peak position of number 36 on January 12, 1980.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/sugarhill-gang/chart-history/hot-100/song/578347|title=Sugarhill Gang|website=Billboard.com|access-date=28 June 2021}}</ref> This was the trio's only U.S. hit, though they did have further success in Europe until the mid-1980s. The trio reformed in 1999 and did a world tour in 2016.

==Formation and early years==
The members, all from [[Englewood, New Jersey|Englewood]], [[New Jersey]], consisted of [[Wonder Mike|Michael "Wonder Mike" Wright]], [[Big Bank Hank|Henry "Big Bank Hank" Jackson]], and [[Master Gee (musician)|Guy "Master Gee" O'Brien]]. The three were assembled into a group by [[record producer|producer]] [[Sylvia Robinson]], who founded [[Sugar Hill Records (rap)|Sugar Hill Records]] with her husband, record producer Joe Robinson.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sugar Hill Gang bio|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/sugarhill-gang-p102|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=April 12, 2012}}</ref> The group and the record company were named after the [[Sugar Hill, Harlem]], neighborhood.<ref>{{cite news|last=Perrone |first=Pierre |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/sylvia-robinson-hitmaker-who-cofounded-sugar-hill-records-and-became-known-as-lsquothe-mother-of-hiphoprsquo-2365098.html |title=Sylvia Robinson: Hitmaker who co-founded Sugar Hill Records and became known as 'the mother of hip-hop'|newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=2011-10-04 |access-date=2013-09-15 |location=London}}</ref>

Their 1979 [[hit record|hit]] "[[Rapper's Delight]]" was the first rap [[single (music)|single]] to become a Top 40 hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The group never had another U.S. hit, though it had multiple European hits, such as "[[Apache (instrumental)#The Sugarhill Gang: "Apache" (1981)|Apache]]", "[[8th Wonder (song)|8th Wonder]]" (which was performed on the American music show ''[[Soul Train]]'' in 1981), "Rapper's Reprise (Jam Jam)", and "Showdown" (with the [[Furious Five]]). The trio wound down  over the next five years and disbanded in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-sugarhill-gang-mn0000564631/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|title=The Sugarhill Gang  Biography|author=John Bush}}</ref>

==Later years==
[[File:Sugarhill Gang Tour, 2016 (2).jpg|thumb|The Sugarhill Gang on Tour, 2016|right]]
In 1999, the trio reunited and recorded ''Jump on It!'' a hip hop children's album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/jump-on-it!-mw0000664152|title=Jump on It! - The Sugarhill Gang - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

After Wonder Mike and Hen Dogg left Sugarhill Records in 2005, the original members of Sugarhill Gang (besides Jackson) have performed as the Original Sugar and as Rapper's Delight Featuring Wonder Mike and Master Gee. This is largely due to a string of legal cases against them regarding the use of 'Sugarhill Gang' as their name.

On November 11, 2014, Big Bank Hank died at the age of 58 after a long battle with cancer.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Guse|first1=Clayton|title=Big Bank Hank from Sugarhill Gang dead at age 58|url=http://nyc.suntimes.com/nyc-entertainment/7/86/34712/big-bank-hank-sugarhill-gang-best-songs/|website=Suntimes.com|date=November 11, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111234647/http://nyc.suntimes.com/nyc-entertainment/7/86/34712/big-bank-hank-sugarhill-gang-best-songs/|archive-date=November 11, 2014}}</ref>

In 2016, the remaining living members of the original Sugarhill Gang, including Wonder Mike, Hen Dogg and Master Gee embarked on their first world tour in over a decade under the name The Sugarhill Gang. During this, they performed as the Sugarhill Gang for the Art of Rap festival tour in 2016, and at V Festival in Hylands Park and Weston Park in the UK as part of their world tour in 2016. Other places included, the [[Clockenflap|Clockenflap Festival]] in [[Hong Kong]] on November 27, 2016, and they headlined at the Depot in the Park Festival in Cardiff, United Kingdom on August 5, 2017. In July 2019 they played the North Nibley Festival in [[Gloucestershire]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nibleyfestival.co.uk/lineup/ |title=Line up for Nibley 2019|website=Nibleyfestival.co.uk|access-date=November 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190115023246/https://nibleyfestival.co.uk/lineup/|archive-date=January 15, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49MoasxySdU|title=Sugarhill Gang "Rappers Delight - V Festival, UK, 20.08.2016|date=2016-08-21|access-date=2020-03-28|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZNebGYM0bE|title=The Sugarhill Gang // Rappers Delight // Kendal Calling 2016|date=2017-01-16|access-date=2020-03-28|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZNebGYM0bE|title=The Sugarhill Gang (1) @ Clockenflap 2016|date=2016-12-26|access-date=2020-03-28|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>
