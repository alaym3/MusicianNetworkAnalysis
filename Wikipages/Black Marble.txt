Kristin Porter of ''[[SLUG Magazine|SLUG]]'' said Stewart "keeps the band's Brooklyn, New York–synth roots alive, resulting in a collection of songs with amplified vocals, pastel-colored synths and a hint of modern-day deference, which is evocatively scored by Stewart's personal, nostalgic touch coupled with every happy-sad, [[Ian Curtis]]–garage dance party you've never been to."<ref>{{cite web|url =https://www.slugmag.com/national-music-reviews/black-marble-its-immaterial/|title =Review: Black Marble - It's Immaterial|first =Kristin|last =Porter|website =SLUG|date =September 29, 2016}}</ref>
