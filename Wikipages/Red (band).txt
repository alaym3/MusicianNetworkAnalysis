After they recorded several demos displaying a style of [[alternative rock|alternative]], [[hard rock|hard]], and [[Christian rock]] music, Red landed a development deal with their longtime producer [[Rob Graves]] which led to a record deal with Christian label [[Essential Records (Christian)|Essential Records]] in 2004.

Red's mainstream popularity grew and their third album, ''[[Until We Have Faces]]'' (2011), reached No. 2 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], which was followed by ''[[Release the Panic]]'' (2013), which peaked at No. 7.
