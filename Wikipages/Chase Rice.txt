==Early life, education, and early career==
Born in Florida, Rice was raised on a farm in [[Asheville, North Carolina]]. He attended [[AC Reynolds High School]]<ref name="Chase Rice Biography">{{cite web|title=Chase Rice Biography|url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/ar_artists_a-z/article/0,,GAC_26071_6037395,00.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130124135747/http://www.gactv.com/gac/ar_artists_a-z/article/0,,GAC_26071_6037395,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 24, 2013|work=Artists|publisher=Great American Country}}</ref> and the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], where he was a linebacker on the [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|football team]], but did not pursue an [[National Football League|NFL]] career due to injury.<ref name="Debuts Big">{{cite news|last=Dauphin|first=Chuck|title=Spotlight: Ex-'Survivor' Star Chase Rice Debuts Big With 'Dirt Road Communion'|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-615/488389/spotlight-ex-survivor-star-chase-rice-debuts-big-with-dirt-road|newspaper=Billboard|date=May 16, 2012}}</ref><ref name="ocregister-concert-preview">{{cite news|last1=Fadorski|first1=Kelli Skye|title=From a NASCAR pit crew member to 'Survivor' star, Chase Rice still prefers country music|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/rice-745140-country-really.html|access-date=February 28, 2017|work=[[Orange County Register]]|date=February 28, 2017}}</ref>

After graduating from UNC, Rice was selected to join the [[Hendrick Motorsports]] [[pit crew]] as the rear tire carrier for [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]]'s [[Nationwide Series]] car. He also worked on [[Jimmie Johnson|Jimmie Johnson's]] [[Sprint Cup Series]] car and won two championships with the [[Lowe's]] team.<ref name="Chase Rice Biography"/><ref name="Rice Hill Country">{{cite web|title=Chase Rice|url=http://hillcountry.com/dc/music-calendar/single-event/189543/|publisher=Hill Country BBQ, Washington, D.C.|access-date=March 5, 2016}}{{Dead link|date=July 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==''Survivor''==
Rice was selected as a cast member of the [[reality television]] show ''[[Survivor: Nicaragua]]''. He said that he was able to get his application into [[CBS]] through a college friend who had a connection with the network.<ref name="runner-up talks">{{cite news|title=Exclusive: 'Survivor: Nicaragua' runner-up Chase Rice talks|url=http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/exclusive-survivor-nicaragua-runner-up-chase-rice-talks-11830.php|newspaper=Reality TV World|date=December 22, 2012}}</ref>

Rice was originally on the La Flor tribe, consisting of younger contestants. During his time on the tribe, he was quickly attracted to fellow contestant Brenda Lowe, who became aware of his attraction and used it to her advantage, recruiting him and several others into an alliance. However, after La Flor won three of the first four tribal immunity challenges, the tribes were blended and Rice ended up on the new version of the original "older contestants" tribe, Espada, while Lowe remained on the new version of the La Flor tribe. Rice and Lowe both ultimately made it to the merged group, Libertad, where their alliance successfully caused the eliminations of Alina Wilson and Marty Piombo, before turning on Lowe and eliminating her as a threat. Following Lowe's elimination, Rice continued with the alliance under new leader Matthew "Sash" Lenahan. After two contestants (NaOnka Mixon and "Purple Kelly" Shinn) quit, the alliance continued eliminating targets Ben "Benry" Henry, Jane Bright, Dan Lembo, and [[Holly Hoffman]], although Bright and Hoffman were members of the alliance. The alliance tried to eliminate [[Jud Birza|Jud "Fabio" Birza]] as a threat against the jury, but Birza managed to evade them by winning the last three immunity challenges. Rice performed exceptionally well in the post-merge challenges, being on the winning team in two of the three team-oriented rewards, and winning the last two individual rewards. Eventually, Rice made it to the final three with Lenahan and Birza, where he had a chance to win the $1 million as "Sole Survivor". In pleading his case to the jury, Rice claimed that he was being open about how he played the game, but was criticized both for his rash decisions and occasional indecisiveness, as well as being perceived as a follower under both Lowe and Lenahan. Although both Rice and Lenahan tried to accuse Birza of not knowing what was going on in the competition, the jury still ultimately chose Birza who received five of the nine votes; Rice received the votes of Hoffman, Bright, Lowe, and Wilson.

On the nationally televised reunion show, Rice played his single "[[Buzz Back]]".<ref name="Country Song on Season Finale">{{cite web|last=Wilkening|first=Matthew|title='Survivor' Finalist Chase Rice Debuts Country Song on Season Finale|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/survivor-finalist-chase-rice-country-song-season-finale/|publisher=Taste of Country}}</ref> Although he received national media attention on the show, he says that reality show stardom did not help propel his country music career; instead, he cited it as an important life event that was more valuable than money and that put his life in perspective.

In the official issue of ''[[CBS Watch]]'' magazine, commemorating the 15th anniversary of ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]'' in 2015, Rice was voted by viewers as the 10th "steamiest" male contestant in ''Survivor'' history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/DaltonRoss/status/565168330513080320 |title=Wait, where's @JohnMCochran? |publisher=Twitter |first=Dalton |last=Ross |date=February 10, 2015 |access-date=February 10, 2015}}</ref>

==Country music career==
Chase Rice began playing guitar in college. He cites his father as the inspiration for his career, recalling his father saying "boy anyone can play guitar, but no one is gonna really listen to you until you start singing."<ref name="Rice Hill Country"/> He models his albums after his live show and is building his career through the performance aspect.<ref name="Debuts Big"/> His first studio album, ''Friday Nights & Sunday Mornings'', was released on April 22, 2010. This 13-track album includes the first song he ever wrote/recorded, “Larger Than Life”, which is about the passing of his father. This is the only full-length album Rice has released that is not available for digital purchase or streaming.

In March 2011, he released ''[[Country as Me]]'', a six-track EP featuring his single "[[Buzz Back]]". He has received air play as a "Highway Find" on satellite radio channel [[The Highway (Sirius XM)]]. In April 2012, his ''[[Dirt Road Communion]]'' debuted at number 48 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard charts|Country Albums]] chart.<ref name="Debuts Big" /> This album included the original recordings of "Jack Daniels and Jesus" and "How She Rolls", the latter of which has been removed from streaming and digital platforms in its original form. "Whoa" has also been removed from all digital and streaming platforms, but was never re-released leaving the current total tracks on the album at 14. "Happy Hour (Worktape)" includes a hidden track, "Kiss My Ass", which begins at the 4:31 minute mark on the song.

In July 2012, he signed with [[Creative Artists Agency]].<ref name="Signs with CAA">{{cite news|title=Indie artist Chase Rice Signs with CAA|url=http://nashvillecountryclub.com/News.php?id=4177|newspaper=Nashville Country Club|date=July 19, 2012}}</ref> He was a co-writer of [[Florida Georgia Line]]'s "[[Cruise (song)|Cruise]]", which topped ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]].<ref name="Platinum Success">{{cite web|title=Chase Rice 'Cruise's with Florida Georgia Line to Platinum Success and a #1 Single|url=http://www.gotcountryonline.com/chase-rice-cruises-with-florida-georgia-line-to-platinum-success-and-a-1-single/|publisher=Got Country Online|access-date=December 28, 2012}}</ref>

In October 2013, he released ''[[Ready Set Roll (EP)|Ready Set Roll]]'', a six-song EP including the title track. The physical version of the album was released in November 2013 and included the bonus song "Jack Daniel's and Jesus". On January 29, 2014, the official "[[Ready Set Roll]]" music video premiered exclusively on CMT.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chaserice.com/103-official-ready-set-roll-music-video-premieres-on-cmt|title=Official Ready Set Roll Music Video Premieres on CMT |access-date=February 4, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221113825/http://chaserice.com/103-official-ready-set-roll-music-video-premieres-on-cmt |archive-date=February 21, 2014 }}</ref> The next day, the video debuted on VEVO.

In February 2016, Rice released "Whisper", which was intended to be the lead single from an upcoming album. The song failed to gain any traction on the radio,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.savingcountrymusic.com/chase-rices-new-lead-single-whisper-takes-a-flop-big-time/ |title=Chase Rice's New Lead Single "Whisper" Takes a Flop. Big Time. |publisher=Saving Country Music |date=April 19, 2016 |access-date=July 31, 2016}}</ref> peaking at number 56 on the week of April 23, 2016, after just 3 weeks of being on the Country Airplay chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/299025/chase-rice/chart?f=1226 |title=Chase Rice - Chart history |work=Billboard |access-date=July 31, 2016}}</ref> It is currently Rice's lowest peaking single to date, only behind How She Rolls which peaked at number 55 in 2013, which never received real label backing. Upon releasing the single, Rice issued a letter to his fans stating, "If you have listened to my music for years and want to hear more depth and meaning, I very much appreciate you, too, and your desires will also be fulfilled on this album (and truthfully, that was my goal on previous albums with songs like "Carolina Can" and "Every Song I Sing.")" He went on to mention he was influenced by Garth Brooks and Kenny Chesney.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://countrymusicrocks.net/2016/02/chase-rice-pens-honest-and-heartfelt-letter-to-fans.html/|title=Chase Rice Pens Honest and Heartfelt Letter to Fans|date=February 5, 2016|website=Country Music Rocks|language=en-US|access-date=December 1, 2021}}</ref> Rice then released "Everybody We Know Does", which was sent to country radio on June 24, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|author=Lauren Laffer|url=http://www.soundslikenashville.com/music/chase-rice-releases-new-single-everybody-we-know-does/ |title=Chase Rice Releases New Single, 'Everybody We Know Does' Sounds Like Nashville |publisher=Soundslikenashville.com |date=June 24, 2016 |access-date=July 31, 2016}}</ref>

After "Everybody We Know Does" failed to crack the top 25, Rice left Columbia in 2017 and signed to [[Broken Bow Records]] the same year. The lead single from Rice's first album with BBR, "Three Chords and the Truth", was sent to country radio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theboot.com/chase-rice-bbr-music-group-broken-bow-records/|title=Chase Rice Signs With Broken Bow, Ready to Release New Music|website=The Boot|access-date=December 10, 2017}}</ref> This single was highly praised by both country fans and radio, as this was his first single to crack the Top 25 on the [[Country Airplay]] chart in 4 years.

''Lambs & Lions'' is Rice's first album on Broken Bow Records/BMG and is also the first album released by BBR since the BMG takeover. ''Lambs & Lions'' was released on November 17, 2017.

Rice's single "[[Eyes on You (Chase Rice song)|Eyes on You]]" became his first number one on country radio on May 6, 2019, staying at the top for two weeks.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Stevens |first1=Buck |title=Chase Rice Holds Number One for Second Week with "Eyes On You" |url=http://www.wbwn.com/2019/05/13/chase-rice-holds-number-one-for-second-week-with-eyes-on-you/ |website=wbwn.com |access-date=23 May 2019}}</ref> He then released the follow-up single "[[Lonely If You Are]]" on July 1, 2019.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.thecountrydaily.com/2019/06/07/chase-rice-drops-friendly-new-single-lonely-if-you-are-listen/ | title=Chase Rice Drops Friendly New Single, "Lonely If You Are" [Listen] | publisher=The Country Daily | date=June 7, 2019 | access-date=September 22, 2020 | author=Jim Casey}}</ref>

On June 27, 2020, Rice played a concert at the [[Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary]], in [[Petros, Tennessee]] where many fans chose to ignore recommended safety measures against spreading and contracting [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID]].
