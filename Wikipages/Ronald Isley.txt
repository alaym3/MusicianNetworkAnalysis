'''Ronald Isley''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|z|l|iː}}; born May 21, 1941)<ref>{{cite web |title=Ronald Isley {{!}} Biography & History |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/ronald-isley-mn0000298364/biography |website=AllMusic |access-date=10 August 2020 |language=en-us}}</ref> is an American recording artist, songwriter, record producer, and occasional actor. Isley is best known as the lead singer and founding member of the family music group [[The Isley Brothers]].

==Early life==
Born in 1941 to Sallye Bernice (née Bell) and O'Kelly Isley Sr, Isley was the third of six brothers ([[O'Kelly Isley Jr.]], [[Rudolph Isley]], Vernon Isley, [[Ernie Isley]], [[Marvin Isley]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://psychedelichippiemusic.blogspot.com/2009/11/isley-brothers-success-at-its-best.html|title=Dr Robert Muller – 1960s Psychedelic Hippie Culture and Music: The Isley Brothers – Success at Its Best|first=Dr Robert|last=Muller|date=November 6, 2009}}</ref> Ronald, like many of his siblings, began his career in the church. Isley began singing at the age of two, winning a $25 [[war bond]] for singing at a [[Spiritual (music)|spiritual]] contest at the Union Baptist Church. By the age of seven, Isley was singing on-stage at venues such as the [[Regal Theater, South Side (Chicago)|Regal Theater]] in Chicago, alongside [[Dinah Washington]] and a few other notables.{{who|date=August 2020}}

==Career==
By his early teens, Isley was singing regularly with his brothers in church tours and also first appeared on TV on [[Ted Mack (radio-TV host)|Ted Mack]]'s ''Amateur Hour''. In 1957, 16-year-old Isley and his two elder brothers O'Kelly and Rudy then 19 and 18 moved to New York to pursue a music career. While in New York, Isley and his brother began recording doo-wop for local labels before landing a major deal with [[RCA Records]] in 1959, where the trio wrote and released their debut single "[[Shout (Isley Brothers song)|Shout]]". By the summer of 1959, the Isley family had moved from Cincinnati to a home in [[Englewood, New Jersey]].<ref name=Isley>Wilner, Paul. [https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/13/archives/westchester-weekly-isley-brothers-a-family-affair.html "Isley Brothers: A Family Affair"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 13, 1977. Accessed September 18, 2011. "WHEN Sallye Isley moved her brood of children from Cincinnati to Englewood in the summer of 1959, she was participating in a show-business phenomenon.... While their older brothers toured America, the younger Isley boys enrolled successively in Englewood Junior High and Dwight Morrow High School.... Right now, the brothers reside near enough to each other to keep in close touch. Ronald lives in Teaneck, Kelly Jr. in Alpine, Rudolph in Haworth and Ernie in Englewood."</ref>

For much of the Isley Brothers' duration, Isley would remain the group's consistent member of the group as well as the lead vocalist for most of the group's tenure with sporadic lead shares with his older brothers. In 1969, Isley reformed [[T-Neck Records]] with his brothers in a need to produce themselves without the control of record labels, forming the label shortly after ending a brief tenure with [[Motown Records|Motown]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/jan/07/10-of-the-best-isley-brothers|title=10 of the best: the Isley Brothers|last=Chick|first=Steve|date=January 7, 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=January 7, 2014}}</ref> In 1973, the group's style and sound drastically changed following the release of the ''[[3 + 3]]'' album where brothers [[Ernie Isley]] and [[Marvin Isley]] and in-law [[Chris Jasper]] permanently enter the brothers' lineup, writing the music and lyrics to the group's new sound. The younger brothers had been providing instrumental help for the brothers since the late 1960s. By the mid-1970s, Isley was living in [[Teaneck, New Jersey]].<ref name=Isley/>

After Kelly Isley's death in 1986 and Rudy Isley's exit to fulfill a dream of ministry in 1989, Ronald has carried on with the Isley Brothers name either as a solo artist or with accompanying help from the group's younger brothers, much more prominently, Ernie Isley. In 1990, Isley scored a top-ten duet with [[Rod Stewart]] with a cover of his brothers' hit "[[This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)]]", and in 2003 Ronald recorded a solo album, ''Here I Am: Bacharach Meets Isley'', with [[Burt Bacharach]]. In addition, Ron Isley became a sought-after [[Hook (music)|hook singer]] for [[R. Kelly]], [[Warren G]], [[2Pac]] and [[UGK]].{{cn|date=August 2020}} Isley released his first solo album ''Mr. I'' on November 30, 2010. The album includes the first single "No More". It debuted at number 50 on the ''Billboard'' 200, selling 22,243 copies. It was his first solo album to crack that chart.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/ronald-isley-honored-soul-train-awards-2010-set-release-solo-album-mr-article-1.450643|title=Ronald Isley honored at Soul Train Awards 2010, set to release first solo album 'Mr I'|last=Roberts|first=Soraya|date=November 29, 2010|work=[[New York Daily News]]|access-date=November 3, 2020}}</ref>
