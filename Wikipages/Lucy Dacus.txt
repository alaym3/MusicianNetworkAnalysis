Dacus's second album, entitled ''[[Historian (album)|Historian]]'', was released on March 2, 2018.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.avclub.com/the-breeders-camp-cope-and-more-albums-to-know-about-1823336220| website= avclub.com| publisher= AV Club| title= The Breeders, Camp Cope, and more albums to know about this week| first1= Kelsey J. |last1= Waite| first2= Matt |last2= Gerardi| first3= Alex |last3= McLevy| first4= David |last4= Anthony| first5= Steve |last5= Erickson| date= March 2, 2018| access-date= April 21, 2018}}</ref> Like its predecessor, it was met with widespread critical acclaim. Writing for Pitchfork, Sasha Gessen praised its nuance and sensitivity: "It’s not an easy album to wear out. It lasts, and it should, given that so many of its lyrics pick at time, and the way time condenses around deep emotional attachments to other people." ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' rated the album 4/5 stars, as did ''[[NME]]''. ''Historian'', like ''No Burden'', was recorded in Nashville, at Trace Horse Studio, in a similar collaborative effort by Lucy Dacus, Jacob Blizard, and Collin Pastore.

In 2018, Dacus, along with [[Phoebe Bridgers]] and [[Julien Baker]], formed the group [[Boygenius]]. They released three songs in August 2018 and subsequently announced an EP and tour.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8471478/boygenius-announces-ep-tour-new-songs|title=Julian Baker, Lucy Dacus, Phoebe Bridgers Form Boygenius, Release Three Singles From EP: Listen|last=Rincón|first=Alessandra|date=August 21, 2018|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-11-05}}</ref> The EP, titled ''boygenius'', came out on October 26, 2018.

To coincide with [[Valentine's Day]] 2019, Dacus released a cover of "[[La Vie en rose]]", the first in a planned series of songs commemorating major holidays.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2019/01/31/690253638/lucy-dacus-covers-an-edith-piaf-classic-and-pays-homage-to-love|title=Lucy Dacus Covers An Edith Piaf Classic And Pays Homage To Love|website=Npr.org|language=en|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref>

==Activism==
After Texas' new abortion law went into effect on Wednesday, September 1, 2021, Dacus announced on Twitter that all the money she makes at her upcoming shows in Texas "will be going towards abortion funds." She also informed her fans to bring extra money to her Houston and San Antonio shows for the donation to the abortion funds.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mamo|first=Heran|title=Lucy Dacus Says All Proceeds From Her Texas Concerts Will Go Toward Abortion Funds|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9624068/lucy-dacus-donating-texas-show-proceeds-abortion-funds/|date=September 2, 2021|access-date=September 2, 2021|website=Billboard}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Dacus is friends with singer-songwriter and fellow Matador signee [[Julien Baker]], for whom she has opened several times following their first show together in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]].
