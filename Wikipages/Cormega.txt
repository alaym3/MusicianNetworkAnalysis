== Career ==
===1990s===
He was featured on Hot Day's "Going Straight Up" from his album ''It's My Turn''. He was also featured on [[Blaq Poet]] and DJ Hot Day's track "Set It Off" from their album ''Without Warning'' in 1991. During a period of incarceration, Cormega gained some attention following a [[shout-out]] from [[Nas]] on his song "[[One Love (Nas song)|One Love]]", from the ''[[Illmatic]]'' album released in 1994.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p278660|pure_url=yes}}|title=Cormega biography|author=Birchmeier, Jason|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>
Following his release from jail in 1995, Cormega became determined to pursue rapping. Nas included him on a song entitled "Affirmative Action" on his album ''[[It Was Written]]'' released on July 2, 1996. The song also featured [[AZ (rapper)|AZ]] and [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]], and became [[The Firm (hip hop group)|The Firm]]'s first appearance.<ref name="firm" /> He was signed to [[Def Jam]] and recorded an album called ''[[The Testament (album)|The Testament]]''. Nas, his manager [[Steve Stoute]] and producers [[Dr. Dre]] and [[Trackmasters|The Trackmasters]] joined to form The Firm. However, Cormega was replaced with another Queensbridge artist, [[Nature (artist)|Nature]], because Nas and/or Stoute favored Nature.<ref name="firm">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p276628|pure_url=yes}}|title=The Firm > Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|author=Birchmeier, Jason}}</ref> That ended Cormega's friendship with Nas. After he fell out with his manager Chris Lighty and his label [[Violator Records]] his debut album ''The Testament'' was indefinitely shelved. During the recording for ''The Testament'' Cormega responded to Nas' "[[One Love (Nas song)|One Love]]" in the form of a letter also entitled "One Love".<ref name="allmusic" /><ref name="stylus">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/cormega/the-true-meaning.htm|title=Cormega – The True Meaning – Review|magazine=[[Stylus Magazine]]|author=Berliner, Brett|date=September 1, 2003|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225164305/http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/cormega/the-true-meaning.htm|archive-date=December 25, 2008}}</ref>

In 2000, he was released from his contract and he started his own record company, Legal Hustle Records.<ref name="allmusic" /> Cormega vented his disappointment with Nas and The Firm in a [[mixtape]] song titled "Never Personal". This song was never directly pointed to Nas, but the media made it  look like that.<ref name="firm" /> In 2001, he released his new debut album, ''[[The Realness]]''.<ref name="allmusic" /> Many of the songs share a theme of [[betrayal]].<ref name="stylus" /> [[Nas]] responded to Cormega on his song "Destroy and Rebuild" from his album ''[[Stillmatic]]''. Cormega retaliated with more mixtape tracks, "A Slick Response" and "Realmatic".

Cormega's follow-up album, ''[[The True Meaning]]'' won the [[Source Magazine]] 's Underground Album of the Year award.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}  In 2004, he followed up with ''[[Legal Hustle]]'', a [[compilation album]] showcasing his label's artists.
