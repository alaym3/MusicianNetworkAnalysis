'''Thrice''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Irvine, California]], formed in 1998. The group was founded by guitarist/vocalist [[Dustin Kensrue]] and lead guitarist Teppei Teranishi while they were in high school.

Early in their career, the band was known for fast, hard music based in heavily distorted guitars, prominent lead guitar lines, and frequent changes in [[Unusual time signatures|complex time signatures.]] This style is exemplified on their second album, ''[[The Illusion of Safety (Thrice album)|The Illusion of Safety]]'' (2002) and their third album ''[[The Artist in the Ambulance]]'' (2003). Their fourth album ''[[Vheissu]]'' (2005) made significant changes by incorporating electronic beats, keyboards, and a more experimental sound. In 2007 and 2008, Thrice released ''[[The Alchemy Index (disambiguation)|The Alchemy Index]]'', consisting of two studio albums that together make a four-part, 24-song cycle. Each of the four six-song EPs of the Alchemy Index features significantly different styles, based on different aspects of the band's musical esthetic which reflect the [[Classical element|elemental themes]] of fire, water, air and earth, both lyrically and musically. The band's seventh album, ''[[Beggars (album)|Beggars]],'' was released on August 11, 2009, and their eighth, ''[[Major/Minor (album)|Major/Minor]]'' on September 20, 2011. The most recent albums feature a refined combination of the band's different experiments and explorations. In 2011, Thrice announced a final tour and an imminent hiatus.

Kensrue and Teranishi decided to reform the band in 2015 after attending a [[Brand New (band)|Brand New]] concert. In 2016, Thrice released their first post-reunion album, ''[[To Be Everywhere Is to Be Nowhere]].'' 
The band's tenth album, ''[[Palms (Thrice album)|Palms]]'', was released in 2018. Their eleventh studio album ''Horizons/East'' was released in September 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Oakeshott|first=Will|date=2021-09-21|title=Dustin Kensrue – Thrice 'Influences of Now and a Look Beyond the Horizon'|url=https://wallofsoundau.com/2021/09/22/dustin-kensrue-thrice-interview-2021/|access-date=2021-09-21|website=Wall Of Sound|language=en-US}}</ref> Each album released by Thrice has had a portion of its sales proceeds donated to a new charitable organization.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merch.com/products.asp?dept=726 |title=Thrice T-Shirts and Band Merchandise |access-date=December 17, 2007 |publisher=Merch.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212132031/http://www.merch.com/products.asp?dept=726 |archive-date=December 12, 2007}}</ref><ref name="STS">{{cite web |url=http://www.soundthesirens.com/articles/index.php?id=8,81,0,0,1,0 |title=Interview with Riley |access-date=December 17, 2007 |publisher=Sound the Sirens Magazine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014210838/http://soundthesirens.com/articles/index.php?id=8%2C81%2C0%2C0%2C1%2C0 |archive-date=October 14, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Riley Breckenridge gave an in-depth interview regarding the album in September 2018.  Talking about 'Only Us' Breckenridge stated: "It’s a song about inclusion and compassion and togetherness — realizing that we’re all connected and should be able to rally around that to make the world a better place.".

Palms was produced by Eric Palmquist, whom the band had worked with in the past. Breckenridge also spoke about working with Palmquist on this record saying: "He's great to work with. We communicate really well. He pushes me hard, but he's also a really patient and encouraging person, which is invaluable in a studio setting."<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rawmusictv.com/interview/2018/THRICE-Palms-is-our-most-diverse-record-since-The-Alchemy-Index | title = THRICE: 'Palms is our most diverse record since The Alchemy Index' | date = September 25, 2018 | access-date = September 25, 2018}}</ref>

Thrice's first two albums, ''[[Identity Crisis (Thrice album)|Identity Crisis]]'' and ''[[The Illusion of Safety (Thrice album)|The Illusion of Safety]]'' have been described as metal and punk influenced post-hardcore.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=http://www.ocweekly.com/music/the-10-best-thrice-songs-7197683|title=The 10 Best Thrice Songs|last=Johnson|first=Dale|date=May 18, 2016|work=OC Weekly|access-date=October 2, 2017}}</ref> Thrice's earlier music was known for being fast and based in heavily distorted guitars, prominent lead guitar lines, and frequent changes in [[Unusual time signatures|complex time signatures.]] This style was mainly demonstrated on their second album, ''The Illusion of Safety,''  and their third album ''[[The Artist in the Ambulance]].''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.interpunk.com/item.cfm?Item=79136& |title=The Illusion of Saftety |access-date=December 16, 2007 |publisher=Interpunk |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121174254/http://www.interpunk.com/item.cfm?Item=79136& |archive-date=January 21, 2008}}</ref> Their first three albums have considered to have elements of [[thrash metal]], screamo, and pop punk.<ref name="vanyaland"/> On their fourth album, ''[[Vheissu]],'' the band incorporated [[Electronic music|electronic]] beats, keyboards, and more experimental and nuanced songwriting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=97074|title=Thrice - Vheissu|access-date=December 6, 2007|publisher=AbsolutePunk.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/review/4534|title=Thrice - Vheissu|access-date=December 16, 2007|publisher=Punknews.org}}</ref> Their fifth and sixth albums, ''[[The Alchemy Index Vols.

There's stuff on this record that wouldn't necessarily feel out of place on ''The Artist in the Ambulance'', or ''Vheissu'' or wouldn't have felt out of place if it was part of ''The Alchemy Index'' or ''Beggars'', or ''Major/Minor''.

As far as the approach, it's probably most similar to Vheissu in that we were trying to pull from a very wide variety of influences"<ref name=":2" />
