The collective uses a [[third eye|three-eyed]], straight-lipped face [[logo]] that figures prominently on their [[Album cover|albums]], website, stickers, and clothing.<ref name="Having it Both Ways: Del the Funky Homosapien has moved out of the shadow of his famous cousin - and every musical cliché - to help lead Bay Area hip hop">{{cite web|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/issues/2000-03-01/music2.html |access-date=2007-01-27 |author=Keast, Darren |title=Having it Both Ways: Del the Funky Homosapien has moved out of the shadow of his famous cousin - and every musical cliché - to help lead Bay Area hip hop |publisher=SFWeekly.com |date=2000-03-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050227161648/http://www.sfweekly.com/issues/2000-03-01/music2.html |archive-date=2005-02-27 }}</ref>

==History==
As a collective, the Hieroglyphics have released three studio albums: ''[[3rd Eye Vision]]'' in [[1998 in music|1998]], ''[[Full Circle (Hieroglyphics album)|Full Circle]]'' in 2003, and ''[[The Kitchen (album)|The Kitchen]]'' in 2013.

In [[2005 in music|2005]], the collective released a [[Live album|live]] [[DVD]] and accompanying [[Compact disc|CD]] of the Hiero's [[2003 in music|2003]] ''[[Full Circle Tour]]''.

The collective has also released five [[compilation album]]s:  ''[[Hieroglyphics B-Sides]]'' and ''[[Hieroglyphics Oldies, Vol. I]]'' in [[1997 in music|1997]], ''[[Hieroglyphics Oldies, Vol. II]]'' in [[1998 in music|1998]], ''[[The Building (album)|The Building]]'' in [[2004 in music|2004]], ''[[The Corner (album)|The Corner]]'' in [[2005 in music|2005]], and most recently, ''[[Over Time (Hieroglyphics album)|Over Time]]'', in March [[2007 in music|2007]].

Individual members of the collective have also released albums of their own, either through solo projects or outside group projects.

== Logo ==
The collective's [[third eye]] logo is the [[Mayan numeral]] for 8. Created by [[Del the Funky Homosapien]], the son of an [[abstract art]]ist, it has been used to promote the collective on their album covers, website, stickers, clothing, and other promotional materials.<ref name="Having it Both Ways: Del the Funky Homosapien has moved out of the shadow of his famous cousin - and every musical cliché - to help lead Bay Area hip hop" />

In a [[2000 in music|2000]] interview with ''[[SF Weekly]]'', Del commented:  {{cquote|When I invented that symbol, I never thought it would get this big. I've seen about 20 people with that tattoo. I saw a comic book -- like ''[[Clerks. (comics)|Clerks]]'' or something -- and one of the fools in there had a Hiero shirt on. I saw a [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]] and [[Method Man]] video, and there's somebody in the crowd with a Hiero shirt on. I think slowly but surely people are starting to pay attention to us.<ref name="Having it Both Ways: Del the Funky Homosapien has moved out of the shadow of his famous cousin - and every musical cliché - to help lead Bay Area hip hop"/>}}   
 
The ''Clerks'' comic in question was drawn by [[Underground comix|underground comic]] artist [[Jim Mahfood]] who has worked various rap and hip hop items into his work over his career. In an interview with ''halftimeonline.net'' in 2004, Mahfood mentioned Del and the Hieroglyphics by name:{{cquote|Working in comics, especially the way I do, is totally comparable to an underground emcee or rap crew because you can actually make a living off of it without selling out or compromising your vision. Some of my heroes are Del The Funkee Homosapien from the Hieroglyphics crew, [[Jurassic 5]], or my homeboy [[Z-Trip]] are all people who have developed a following for doing something really specific.<ref name="Hip Hop and Comics Vol.2: Jim Mahfood (Grrl Scouts)">{{cite web | url = http://halftimeonline.net/portfolio/hiphop-comics-jim-mahfood-grrl-scouts/ | access-date = 2007-08-28 | author = Halftimeonline.net | title = Hip Hop and Comics Vol.2: Jim Mahfood (Grrl Scouts) | publisher = HalftimeOnline.net | date = 2004-01-15}}</ref>}}
