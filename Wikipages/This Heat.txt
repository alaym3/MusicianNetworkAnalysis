'''This Heat''' were an English [[experimental rock]] band, formed in early 1976 in [[Camberwell]], London by multi-instrumentalists Charles Bullen (guitar, clarinet, viola, vocals, tapes), [[Charles Hayward (musician)|Charles Hayward]] (drums, keyboards, vocals, tapes) and [[Gareth Williams (English musician)|Gareth Williams]] (keyboard, guitar, bass, vocals, tapes).

This Heat were active in the ascendancy of British [[punk rock]] and [[post-punk]], but stood apart from those scenes due to an experimental, confrontational, and politically charged approach. This Heat's commercial success was limited, and their discography consisted of only two albums and an EP, but in later years the band have been widely considered a link between early 1970s music styles such as [[krautrock]] and later experimental genres such as [[industrial music]] and [[post-rock]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/deceit-mw0000073264 |title=''Deceit'' – This Heat : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards : AllMusic |last=Kellman |first=Andy |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=23 January 2013}}</ref>

Williams died of cancer in 2001. From 2016 until 2019, Bullen and Hayward reunited, playing under the name '''This Is Not This Heat'''.

==History==
This Heat first came together in 1976 by Charles Hayward and Charles Bullen. Hayward was a member of the progressive rock band [[Quiet Sun]], fronted by guitarist [[Phil Manzanera]] of [[Roxy Music]]. In 1975, Quiet Sun had signed a deal with [[Island Records]] to record an album entitled ''Mainstream''. Whilst touring to support the record, Manzanera stepped down as his commitments with Roxy Music were taking up his time, so Bullen stepped in as a replacement. Quiet Sun dissolved shortly afterwards, but Bullen and Hayward, who had bonded over their similar tastes and attitude to music making, decided to continue working together. After toying with the names Dolphin Logic and Friendly Rifles, they were joined by visual artist Gareth Williams, brought on due to his lack of formal musical training, and the trio settled upon This Heat in reference to the [[1976 British Isles heat wave]], regarded at the time as the hottest summer on record.

This Heat's first radio airplay came in early 1977 from legendary DJ [[John Peel]], to whom they sent a demo tape recorded in the top room at Hayward's parents' house in [[Camberwell]], prior to moving into their 'Cold Storage' studio — a disused cold storage room converted into a studio, which was part of an "Acme Studios" artists studios complex in [[Brixton]]. During this time, they also recorded a session with Ghanaian percussionist Mario Boyer Diekuuroh, parts of which later appeared on a 1982 split cassette with Albert Marcoeur, released by the French experimental rock magazine ''Tago Mago''.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Their [[This Heat (album)|self-titled debut album]] was recorded between February 1976 and September 1978 in various studios and venues, and was released in August 1979. It was characterised by heavy use of [[tape music|tape manipulation]] and [[tape loops|looping]] (especially on the track "24 Track Loop" which was a loop actually on the 2" master tape), combined with more traditional performance (including quite a lot of live stereo microphone in the room recordings) to create dense, eerie, electronic soundscapes. Shortly thereafter, This Heat released the ''[[Health and Efficiency (EP)|Health and Efficiency]]'' EP, which foreshadowed the more rock-oriented sound of their subsequent album.

This Heat then signed a record deal with [[Rough Trade Records]], who released ''[[Deceit (album)|Deceit]]'', the band's second and final album, in 1981. Whilst maintaining their experimental approach, ''Deceit'' found the band incorporating more coherent song structures, and consolidating the dub and world music influences in their work. The album was produced with help from noted [[reggae]] mixer Martin Frederick. Although at the time, like all of This Heat's releases, it sold poorly, ''Deceit'' is now seen as a classic of the [[post-punk]] era. By that time ''Deceit'' was released, Williams had exited from the band, departing for India to study [[kathakali]].

This Heat split up in 1982 after completing their final European tour with bassist-vocalist [[Trefor Goronwy]] and keyboardist Ian Hill joining Bullen and Hayward. Hayward went on to form [[Camberwell Now]] with Goronwy and Stephen Rickard, and remains musically active. Bullen had a solo venture called [[Lifetones]], and released one record, ''[[For a Reason]]'', in 1983 on his Tone of Life imprint and in 1998 released the album ''Internal Clock'' under the name Circadian Rhythms. Williams later formed Flaming Tunes with Mary Currie and released a cassette of material, which was later released on CD.

In 1993 a new album of previously unreleased This Heat recordings was unearthed. ''Repeat'' featured three long tracks, including the title track, a 20-minute remix of "24 Track Loop". ''Out of Cold Storage'', a [[box set]] of all the band's official recordings, was released in June 2006 on This is!, a new [[Recommended Records]] sub-label set up by Hayward and Bullen to re-release This Heat's back catalogue. The set comprises ''This Heat'', ''Deceit'', ''Health and Efficiency'', ''Made Available'' and ''Repeat'', plus ''Live 80/81'', a CD of concert recordings.<ref name="boxset">{{cite book |last=Cutler |first=Chris |author-link=Chris Cutler |title=Out of Cold Storage |year=2006 |type=booklet |location=[[Thornton Heath]], England |publisher=[[Recommended Records]]}}</ref>

In December 2001 This Heat tentatively rehearsed (with Williams); however, nothing came to fruition as Williams died later that month of cancer.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/feb/07/guardianobituaries |title=Obituary: Gareth Williams |last=Baxter |first=Ed |date=7 February 2002 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=23 January 2013}}</ref>

In 2016, Bullen and Hayward reunited under the name This Is Not This Heat to perform a number of critically acclaimed gigs in London. The concerts featured several guests such as [[Thurston Moore]], [[Alexis Taylor]] and [[Daniel O'Sullivan (musician)|Daniel O'Sullivan]]. The reunion continued across the following three years, concluding with a small series of shows in London, New York, and Los Angeles in 2019.

In August 2020, This Heat released part of its catalogue digitally on streaming services,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/this-heat-to-release-discography-digitally-for-the-first-time/|title=This Heat to Release Discography Digitally for the First Time|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=23 June 2020|author=Moreland, Quinn}}</ref> including Bandcamp.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thisheat.bandcamp.com|title=This Heat|access-date=31 August 2020}}</ref>
