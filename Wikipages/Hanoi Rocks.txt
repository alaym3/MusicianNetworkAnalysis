'''Hanoi Rocks''' were a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[rock music|rock]] band formed in 1979. They were the first Finnish band to chart in the UK and they were also popular in Japan. The band broke up in June 1985 after drummer [[Razzle (musician)|Nicholas "Razzle" Dingley]] died in a car accident during their first US tour in December 1984. Original vocalist [[Michael Monroe]] and guitarist [[Andy McCoy]] reunited in 2001 with a new lineup that lasted until 2009. Although musically closer to traditional rock n' roll and punk, the band have been cited as a major influence in the glam metal genre for bands such as [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]] and [[Poison (American band)|Poison]].

According to Finnish radio and TV personality [[Jone Nikula]], who was the band's tour manager in the 2000s, Hanoi Rocks's albums have sold between 780,000 and 1,000,000 copies around the world, mostly in Scandinavia and Japan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://igs.kirjastot.fi/iGS/kysymykset/haku.aspx?word=Myynti |title=iGS – Arkisto |website=Igs.kirjastot.fi |access-date=September 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930165822/http://igs.kirjastot.fi/iGS/kysymykset/haku.aspx?word=Myynti |archive-date=September 30, 2011}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation and early days (1979–1980)===
Hanoi Rocks were formed in [[Helsinki]] in 1979 by Michael Monroe (Matti Fagerholm) and his friend, guitarist Andy McCoy (Antti Hulkko). McCoy did not join the band immediately, because he was the guitarist for the Finnish [[Punk rock|punk]] band [[Pelle Miljoona Oy]]. McCoy allowed Monroe to form the band with an agreement that McCoy would join later.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The original line-up of Hanoi Rocks was Michael Monroe on vocals, former Pelle Miljoona Oy guitarist Stefan Piesnack, Monroe's guitarist [[Nasty Suicide]], bassist Nedo Soininen, and drummer Peki Sirola.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The band toured Finnish clubs, playing McCoy and Monroe's own songs and covers like [[Cheap Trick]]'s "He's a Whore", [[The Police]]'s "Born in the 50s" and [[MC5]]'s "Looking at You". At one of the band's first shows was Seppo Vesterinen, who had brought big-name artists like [[Iggy Pop]] and [[Frank Zappa]] to Finland. Vesterinen soon became the band's manager after speaking with McCoy and Monroe. In late 1980 Andy McCoy left Pelle Miljoona Oy to join Hanoi Rocks, and was later joined by another former Pelle Miljoona Oy member, bassist [[Sam Yaffa|Sami Yaffa]]. McCoy replaced Stefan Piesnack, who had been arrested for drug possession, and Yaffa replaced Nedo. By then Peki had left the band, and when they relocated to [[Stockholm]], they hired an old friend of Monroe and McCoy's, drummer [[Gyp Casino]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

===Stockholm, early recordings and London (1980–1981)===
When they moved to Stockholm, the bandmembers lived mostly on the street, begging for money, except Andy McCoy, who lived with his wealthy girlfriend. In November 1980, the band struck a deal with [[Johanna Kustannus]] and released its debut single, "[[I Want You (Hanoi Rocks song)|I Want You / Kill City Kills]]".<ref name="LarkinHR"/> "I Want You" was a new version of the Swedish song "Vill ha dej" by Heartbreak. McCoy had translated the song, whose title means "I Want You" in Swedish, into English and claimed it as his own. "Kill City Kills" was one of McCoy's oldest songs, which he had written when he was hanging around at a Finnish apartment block called Kill City. Gyp Casino was the band's drummer but did not play on the single as he was recording with another band in Stockholm.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The band launched a 102-day tour in January 1981, which is believed to be the longest rock tour in Finnish history. The tour developed the band's energetic and wild playing style, which audiences were slow to find pleasing but later praised the band for.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The second single "[[Tragedy (Hanoi Rocks song)|Tragedy / Café Avenue]]", written by McCoy when he was fifteen or sixteen years old, was released in February 1981. That same month, the band released its debut album, ''[[Bangkok Shocks, Saigon Shakes, Hanoi Rocks]]'',<ref name="LarkinHR">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Heavy Rock]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1999|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0257-7|pages=201/2}}</ref> produced by Michael Monroe and Andy McCoy, calling themselves "The Muddy Twins." The album was well-received, reaching number five on the Finnish album charts.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

In September 1981, after extensive tours in Sweden and Finland, the band moved to London, where they recorded their second album. On September 19, 1981, the band made their debut at the [[Marquee Club]] in London. In late November they returned to Finland and released the single "[[Desperados (Hanoi Rocks song)|Desperados / Devil Woman]]". Another single, "[[Dead By X-Mas|Dead By X-Mas / Nothing New]]", was released in December.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

===''Oriental Beat'' and Razzle joins (1982)===
In January 1982, Hanoi Rocks recorded their first music videos at the [[Lepakko]], a concert venue and centre of independent youth culture, for the songs "Tragedy", "Oriental Beat", and "Motorvatin'". That same month, the band released their second album ''[[Oriental Beat]]''.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The album was mostly well received by critics and magazines, including ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' and ''[[Kerrang!]]'', whose Dave Dickson continued to extensively cover Hanoi Rocks's career in the 1980s. The band spent the spring of 1982 touring in Sweden, and had their first Japanese breakthrough with "Tragedy." In May, the single "Love's an Injection / Taxi Driver" was released.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

By June 1982, the band had permanently moved to London.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> Monroe met a Hanoi Rocks fan called Razzle at a [[Johnny Thunders]] show.  When Razzle, who was the drummer for London punk band [[The Dark (band)|The Dark]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://punkygibbon.co.uk/bands/d/dark.html|title=The Dark - Discography|website=Punkygibbon.co.uk|access-date=July 18, 2021}}</ref> found out that Monroe was the singer for Hanoi Rocks, he attended some shows, showed up backstage, and asked to be the band's drummer. McCoy and Monroe fired Gyp Casino for his drug use, depression, and suicidal thoughts, and Razzle was hired as the new drummer.<ref name="LarkinHR"/>

In August 1982, Hanoi Rocks released their third studio album, ''[[Self Destruction Blues]]''.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The album featured old singles like "Love's an Injection". Razzle had yet to join the band when the songs were recorded, but he is credited on the album. The album was released in October in Finland, with "Love's an Injection" spending a week at number one on the Finnish singles charts. The band also signed a contract with the Japanese record company Nippon Phonogram.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

===Tour in Asia, ''Back to Mystery City'' and a deal with CBS (1983)===
By January 1983, the band was touring outside of the UK, Finland, and Sweden. The Asian tour was largely covered by British magazines, and the band was featured on the cover of ''Sounds''. The tour started in [[Bombay]], continuing in Hong Kong and Japan. In Japan the band was very popular, with fans breaking into hotels to see the musicians. The ticket prices for the show were as high as for stadium-fillers, and some phone booths in Tokyo played Hanoi Rocks songs. The tour continued from Tokyo to Vietnam.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

In April, the band returned to London for the recording of their fourth album, and went to Israel, where they were not well received. Monroe could not leave the hotel because of his somewhat unconventional appearance: local people thought he was an improperly-dressed woman and would gather around and spit on him.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}} Also, Nasty Suicide broke his ankle; and people did not like the band's loud playing style. In late spring, Hanoi Rocks toured London and Norway, and released a single before the new album, "[[Malibu Beach Nightmare|Malibu Beach / Rebel On The Run]]".{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The band's fourth album, ''[[Back to Mystery City]]'', was released shortly afterward.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> It reached number 87 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name="Official">{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/20627/hanoi-rocks/|title=HANOI ROCKS &#124; full Official Chart History |website=Officialcharts.com|access-date=July 18, 2021}}</ref> Hanoi Rocks toured the UK and in Finland until June 1983, when the band made a deal with [[Columbia Records|CBS]] worth £150,000.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

===Bob Ezrin and ''All Those Wasted Years'' (1983–1984)===
In August 1983, Hanoi Rocks released the 7" single "[[Until I Get You|Until I Get You / Tragedy]]", and the 12" maxi-single "Until I Get You / Tragedy / Oriental Beat." On August 13, Lick Records released Hanoi Rocks's first three albums in Britain for the first time. The next day, the band played a show at the [[Ruisrock]] festival in Turku, Finland. Before the show, Michael Monroe stated in an interview with the Finnish television station YLE that McCoy and Suicide's alcohol use had gotten out of hand, and that he did not drink or use drugs. In October 1983, producer [[Bob Ezrin]] flew from the US to see Hanoi Rocks live in London, and in December he was confirmed as the producer for the next album.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Their December shows at Marquee were recorded and released as a live album and an accompanying live video, both titled ''[[All Those Wasted Years]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

===''Two Steps from the Move'' (1984)===
In early 1984, Hanoi Rocks and Bob Ezrin recorded ''Two Steps from the Move'',<ref name="LarkinHR"/> in New York and Toronto. Ezrin had invited [[Ian Hunter (singer)|Ian Hunter]] of [[Mott the Hoople]] to help with the songwriting, and Hunter brought [[Jack Bruce]] (formerly of [[Cream (band)|Cream]]), who in turn brought [[Pete Brown]], to the recording sessions. Brown wrote a lot of lyrics, but the only one the band used was "Smoked a lot of sky, drank a lot of rain", in "Million Miles Away".{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

By the end of April the new album was almost ready for release, but Ezrin and the label thought that the album was missing a hit, so they recorded [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]]'s "[[Up Around the Bend]]",<ref name="LarkinHR"/> which was already a favorite of Michael Monroe and Nasty Suicide.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

In May 1984, Hanoi Rocks went on tour in Bombay and Japan. In Japan, excitement over the band led to sold-out concert halls and fans following the band everywhere. Even in Finland people were baffled by the extent of the band's popularity in Japan.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The Japanese tour was followed by a tour across England and Scotland. British magazines raved about the band, and were certain that the next record would be their breakthrough. In June, the single "Up Around The Bend / Until I Get You" was released, but it also appeared as a double single and as an [[Extended Play|EP]]. A music video for "Up Around the Bend" was also produced. At the time it was the most expensive music video for any Finnish band. The song climbed to number 61 on the [[UK Singles Chart]],<ref name="Official"/> and got radio airplay in America.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

After a July tour in England, ''[[Two Steps From The Move]]'', whose title was changed from ''Silver Missiles and Nightingales'' at the last minute, was released. It was their most successful album in the UK Albums Chart, where it peaked at number 28.<ref name="Official"/>  "[[Underwater World (song)|Underwater World / Shakes]]" and "Two Steps From the Move" were released as singles in the UK, and right away the band went on tour with Johnny Thunders.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

In November the single "[[Don't You Ever Leave Me|Don't You Ever Leave Me / Oil And Gasoline]]" was released, by which time the new album had sold 200,000 copies—most of them in the U.S. (60,000), Britain (50,000), and Finland (20,000). In the US the album sold 44,000 copies in its first two weeks.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

After a Swedish tour, the band toured America until Michael Monroe fractured his ankle onstage at USA Sam's in Syracuse, NY on November 29, resulting in some of the dates being canceled. Los Angeles shows were all sold out in less than half an hour.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

===Razzle's death, ''Rock & Roll Divorce'', and break-up (1984–1985)===
On December 8, Hanoi Rocks band members (except for Michael Monroe, who was recuperating from his fractured ankle) were partying with their friends [[Mötley Crüe]], at lead singer [[Vince Neil]]'s house. The party stopped when everybody noticed they were out of beer. Neil and Razzle, both drunk, went to a nearby liquor store in Neil's [[De Tomaso Pantera|Pantera]], with Neil driving. On the way back, they crashed into another car. Razzle was rushed to the hospital and pronounced dead at 7:12&nbsp;p.m.; he had died instantly in the collision.<ref name="LarkinHR"/>

Both occupants of the other car were seriously injured, sustaining brain damage as a result of the crash.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://members.ozemail.com.au/~cruekiss/84.htm |title=Chronological Crue – 1984 |website=Members.ozemail.com.au |access-date=January 19, 2016}}</ref> Andy McCoy and Mötley Crüe drummer [[Tommy Lee]] went looking for Neil and Razzle. They drove by the crash site and saw Neil handcuffed and put into a police car. They were informed that Razzle had been taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. McCoy informed the band's manager Seppo Vesterinen, who then told the rest of the band.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} The band returned to London. The only tour dates not canceled were two shows at Helsinki [[Kulttuuritalo]] on January 3 and 4, 1985, which were broadcast live under the title of "Europe A Go-Go" to a worldwide audience of 200 million viewers. Both shows became memorials to Razzle, with "Million Miles Away" dedicated to him. Former [[The Clash|Clash]] drummer [[Terry Chimes]] played the drums.<ref name="LarkinHR"/>

In 1985, after the shows, Sam Yaffa left the group due to personal differences with Andy McCoy. The band returned to London to take a short break. Yaffa was replaced by bassist [[René Berg]]. Terry Chimes remained as the new drummer. Monroe planned to quit, but the record label convinced him to do a short tour in Poland, where "Don't You Ever Leave Me" was rising on the charts.<ref name="Official"/> Monroe agreed on the condition that no live record would be released, but a semi-official live album was released. Entitled ''[[Rock & Roll Divorce]]'', the album was panned by the managers, band members and critics. René Berg often stated that Hanoi Rocks was "his band", which led to his replacement by bassist [[Timo Kaltio]]. This line-up never performed live, and on June 17, 1985, Monroe officially left Hanoi Rocks, ending the band.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> At the same time, "Don't You Ever Leave Me" rose to number 6 on the Polish singles chart and Hanoi Rocks's popularity continued into the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

===Rebirth and new success (2001–2007)===
In February 2001, Monroe and McCoy performed together for the first time since 1985 in [[Turku]], Finland. They toured again in the summer of 2001, under the moniker "Hanoi Revisited".{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

After the short tour, Monroe and McCoy agreed to reform the band. This would be (as the two put it), a "rebirth", not a reformation of Hanoi Rocks, mainly because none of the other members were able to join: Razzle was dead; Nasty Suicide had become a [[pharmacist]]; Sami Yaffa was a member of a New York-based group called Mad Juana and the bassist for the [[New York Dolls]]; and Gyp Casino was no longer active in music. "The Muddy Twins" chose Kari "[[Lacu (musician)|Lacu]]" Lahtinen from Monroe's solo band to play the drums, Timpa Laine (also from Monroe's solo band) to play the bass, and  Costello Hautamäki from the Finnish rock band [[Popeda]] to play guitar.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The new Hanoi Rocks toured. McCoy and Monroe made a deal that they would be equal writers on songs, and not just McCoy. By 2002, the two had written enough songs for an album, and ''[[Twelve Shots on the Rocks]]'' was released. Although the album was a hit in Finland and Japan, Monroe and McCoy were not present when the album was mixed, and when they heard the finished product they were not happy. The album was remixed in 2003, featuring two new songs, "Moonlite Dance" and "Bad News".{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Most of 2003 and 2004 consisted of touring, but Costello departed to continue his work with Popeda. Costello was replaced by guitarist Stevie Klasson, whose only recording with Hanoi Rocks was the "[[Keep Our Fire Burning]]" single. Klasson was fired from Hanoi Rocks in the fall of 2004 for not getting along with other members. Bassist Timpa left because of family issues.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

In 2004 the band (now consisting of Monroe, McCoy and Lacu) headed to the studio to record the album ''[[Another Hostile Takeover]]''. With no bassist and no guitarist, Monroe had to play some of the bass and guitar parts, but in early 2005 the band was able to find a new guitarist, [[Conny Bloom]]. Bloom had played with Gyp Casino and the [[Electric Boys]] and fit well with Hanoi Rocks. He suggested that bassist [[Andy Christell|Andy "A.C." Christell]], who had also played with the Electric Boys, should join the band.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The reaction to ''Another Hostile Takeover'' was mixed. Critics liked the album's diversity and braveness to try new things, but some of the old fans and hard rock fans thought that the album was weird and that Hanoi Rocks had changed too much since the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

In 2005 and 2006, the band toured in Europe and Asia.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

On August 18, 2007 the band perform their new single 'Fashion' on Swedish Saturday live TV show [[Sommarkrysset]] ([[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]]). 
For 2007's ''Street Poetry'' the band worked on some of the unfinished songs from the 1980s, such as "Teenage Revolution", which was first thought of during the ''Two Steps from the Move'' sessions in 1984. This album also marked the first time that other band members besides Monroe and McCoy were permitted to write songs. ''Street Poetry'' was released on September 5, 2007, and a music video was shot for the first single, "[[Fashion (Hanoi Rocks song)|Fashion]]".{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

===The final break-up (2008–2009)===
On January 25, 2008 Lacu suddenly announced that he was going to leave Hanoi Rocks to join Popeda. On March 20, the band started their first acoustic tour, titled “Hanoi Rocks Steppin’ Out Acoustically”, during which the band's drum technician played drums.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.viihdeuutinen.net/hanoi-rocks-tekee-akustisia-keikkoja-suomessa |title=News of Hanoi Rocks's acoustic tour |access-date=June 27, 2010}}</ref> On 25 May, it was announced that the band's new drummer would be Swedish drummer George Atlagic. By this time Monroe and McCoy had come to the decision that Hanoi Rocks's time had come to an end, as they no longer had collaborated since 2007 and things were getting stale. Eventually Monroe and McCoy released a statement that they had taken the band as far as they could and that the band would break up.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

In late 2008 an autobiography titled ''All Those Wasted Years'' was released. It mainly covered Hanoi Rocks's career in the 1980s and included rare photos of the band and its members and new interviews with Monroe, McCoy, Nasty Suicide, Gyp Casino, Seppo Vesterinen, Richard Bishop and countless others.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Hanoi Rocks announced that they would play eight farewell shows over six days at the [[Tavastia Club]] in Helsinki. All the shows were sold out,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iltalehti.fi/popstars/200904139404608_ps.shtml |title=Iltalehti's overview of Hanoi Rocks's last shows. |website=Iltalehti.fi |access-date=June 25, 2010}}</ref> and the band's original guitarist Nasty Suicide appeared as a special guest in three of the last gigs, and Lacu also appeared at the final show.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The last show was released as a [[DVD]] in late 2009, titled ''[[Buried Alive (video)|Buried Alive]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

==Legacy==
Although Hanoi Rocks never achieved huge commercial success, they have a very big [[cult following]] and they have received critical acclaim for their musical style and energetic live performances.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} On January 5, 1985, Hanoi Rocks was featured in almost every category in a poll cast by ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', including Best Album (5th), Best Band (2nd) and Best Live Act (3rd).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://s1239.photobucket.com/albums/ff507/Uuser12/Hanoi%20Rocks/?action=view&current=IMGdfg.jpg |title=Hanoi Rocks :: IMGdfg.jpg picture by Uuser12 – Photobucket |website=S1239.photobucket.com |access-date=September 13, 2011}}</ref>

Hanoi Rocks's influence can be seen in various bands, including [[Guns N' Roses]], and their glam look has been used by many bands, including Poison, [[L.A. Guns]] and [[Ratt]]. Other bands like [[Manic Street Preachers]], [[Murderdolls]], Skid Row and the [[Foo Fighters]] have acknowledged being Hanoi Rocks fans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/viihde/2008/06/foo_fighters_muisteli_tapaamista_andy_mccoyn_kanssa_katso_video_303816.html |title=Foo Fighters remembering meeting with Andy McCoy (in Finnish) &#124; Viihde &#124; YLE Uutiset |website=Yle.fi |date=June 16, 2008 |access-date=March 19, 2010}} {{dead link |date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.counterculture.co.uk/interview/murderdolls-wednesday-13.html |title=cc &#124; Murderdolls : Wednesday 13 – Interview &#93; » Joey Jordison, Dead In Hollywood |website=Counterculture.co.uk |access-date=September 13, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metalsludge.tv/home/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=337&Itemid=1 |title=Metal Sludge – 20 Questions with Acey Slade, 8/31/04 – The Power & Glory since 1998 |website=Metalsludge.tv |date=August 31, 2004 |access-date=September 13, 2011}}</ref> [[Alice in Chains]] also often played Hanoi Rocks's "Taxi Driver" live in their early days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr_qPsmiNAM|title=Alice in Chains - Taxi Driver (Hollywood, 1991)|access-date=July 18, 2021|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> Other Finnish rock groups that were influenced by Hanoi Rocks include [[The 69 Eyes]] (with whom McCoy has also worked) and [[Negative (Finnish band)|Negative]]. In Finland, Hanoi Rocks is known as the [[Finnish rock]] band who, at their time, had come closest to real international fame, only much later giving way to such groups as [[HIM (Finnish band)|HIM]], [[Nightwish]], [[Sonata Arctica]], [[Stratovarius]], [[Children of Bodom]] and [[Turisas]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Hanoi Rocks also brought the glam rock look of the 1970s back into style. In 2003, when Nasty Suicide was asked about the band's look, he said that he and Michael Monroe decided to keep the punk [[leather jacket]]s but bring a kind of "''transvestite vibe to it''".{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Even though Hanoi Rocks influenced many 1980s glam bands, some feel that these bands ripped off Hanoi Rocks. In 2008 [[Joe Elliott]], frontman of English hard rock band [[Def Leppard]], described his dislike of 1980s glam metal bands like [[Mötley Crüe]] and [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], and said this about Hanoi Rocks:

<blockquote>''"The only band — and I'm not saying it because we're here (Sweden Rock Festival) — the only band that did pull it off was Hanoi Rocks. I thought Hanoi Rocks were a good band, and they looked… Michael Monroe (Hanoi frontman) was one of the best… I would have shagged him. [Laughs] I like Michael, I think he's sexy, and I'm not gay. And I think Andy McCoy (Hanoi guitarist) does the best kind of Keith Richards... so much better than Mötley Crüe or Poison or any of those bands. They (Hanoi Rocks) were real — the rest of the guys, it was all a bit fake for me."''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6mFJqhKIVY |title=Michaels (Poison) answers to Elliott's comment (Def Leppard) |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2008-07-13 |access-date=2011-12-07}}</ref></blockquote>

Michael Monroe and Hanoi Rocks have influenced many rock'n'roll artists and bands: [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] and [[Duff McKagan]] had bought tickets to the sold-out gigs in Los Angeles, which were canceled because of the death of Razzle. In the Hanoi Rocks autobiography "[[All Those Wasted Years]]" Foo Fighters guitarist [[Chris Shiflett]] says "The Hollywood scene changed in just one night after people saw the pictures of Hanoi Rocks. After that everyone was wearing the same kind of hair, clothes and make up as Monroe". Michael Monroe and Hanoi Rocks have often been mentioned as the starters of the Hollywood's glam-rock scene, which was then adopted and developed by many 1980s glam, punk, and hard rock bands like Mötley Crüe, Jetboy, LA Guns and Poison.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}
