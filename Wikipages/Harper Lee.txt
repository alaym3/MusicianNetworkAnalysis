'''Nelle Harper Lee''' (April 28, 1926{{spaced ndash}}February 19, 2016) was an American [[novelist]] best known for her 1960 novel ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]''. It won the 1961 [[Pulitzer Prize]] and has become a classic of modern [[American literature]]. Lee has received numerous accolades and honorary degrees, including the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 2007 which was awarded for her contribution to literature.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/11/20071105-1.html |title=President Bush Honors Medal of Freedom Recipients |publisher=The White House |date=November 5, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Harper Lee, Author Of 'To Kill A Mockingbird,' Dies At Age 89|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/02/19/467348051/harper-lee-to-kill-a-mockingbird-author-reportedly-dies-at-age-89|access-date=2021-06-18|website=NPR.org|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Notre Dame issues statement about passing of Harper Lee, shares video|url=https://www.abc57.com/news/notre-dame-issues-statement-about-passing-of-harper-lee-shares-video|access-date=2021-06-18|website=ABC57|language=en}}</ref> She assisted her close friend [[Truman Capote]] in his research for the book ''[[In Cold Blood]]'' (1966).<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/04/harper-lee-sues-agent-copyright |date=May 4, 2013 |author=Harris, Paul |title=Harper Lee sues agent over copyright to To Kill A Mockingbird}}</ref> Capote was the basis for the character Dill Harris in ''To Kill a Mockingbird''.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Harper Lee, elusive author of 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' is dead at 89|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/harper-lee-elusive-author-of-to-kill-a-mockingbird-is-dead/2016/02/19/a1421368-d71e-11e5-be55-2cc3c1e4b76b_story.html|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = February 19, 2016|access-date = February 19, 2016|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Emily|last = Langer}}</ref>

The plot and characters of ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' are loosely based on Lee's observations of her family and neighbors, as well as an event that occurred near her hometown in 1936 when she was 10. The novel deals with the irrationality of adult attitudes towards race and class in the [[Deep South]] of the 1930s, as depicted through the eyes of two children. It was inspired by racist attitudes in her hometown of [[Monroeville, Alabama]]. She also wrote the novel ''[[Go Set a Watchman]]'' in the mid-1950s and published it in July 2015 as a sequel to ''Mockingbird'', but it was later confirmed to be her first draft of ''Mockingbird''.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/25/opinion/joe-nocera-the-watchman-fraud.html|title=The Harper Lee 'Go Set A Watchman' Fraud|first=Joe|last=Nocera|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 24, 2015|access-date=December 15, 2015}}</ref><ref name="auto1">{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2015/02/03/harper-lee-second-novel-mockingbird-watchman/22792273 |title=New Harper Lee novel on the way! |first=Ann |last=Oldenburg |date=February 3, 2015 |access-date=February 3, 2015 |newspaper=USA Today}}</ref><ref name="New York Times February 2015">{{cite news |last=Alter |first=Alexandra |title= Harper Lee, Author of 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' Is to Publish a Second Novel |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/04/books/harper-lee-author-of-to-kill-a-mockingbird-is-to-publish-a-new-novel.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 3, 2015 |access-date=February 3, 2015}}</ref>

While enrolled at [[Monroe County High School (Alabama)|Monroe County High School]], Lee developed an interest in English literature, in part because teacher Gladys Watson became her mentor. After graduating from high school in 1944,<ref name="EoABio"/> like her eldest sister Alice Finch Lee, Nelle attended the then all-female [[Huntingdon College]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] for a year, then transferred to the [[University of Alabama]] in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]], where she studied law for several years.

==''To Kill a Mockingbird''==
{{quote|I never expected any sort of success with ''Mockingbird''. I was hoping for a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers, but at the same time I sort of hoped someone would like it enough to give me encouragement. Public encouragement. I hoped for a little, as I said, but I got rather a whole lot, and in some ways this was just about as frightening as the quick, merciful death I'd expected.|Harper Lee, quoted in Newquist, 1964<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Newquist |editor-first=Roy |title=Counterpoint |location=Chicago |publisher=Rand McNally |year=1964 |isbn=1-111-80499-0}}</ref>}}

In 1949, Lee moved to [[New York City]] and took a job — first at a bookstore, then as an airline reservation agent — in order to write in her spare time.<ref>Anderson p. 336</ref> After publishing several long stories, Lee found an agent in November 1956; Maurice Crain would become a friend until his death decades later. The following month, at [[Michael Brown (writer)|Michael Brown]]'s East 50th Street townhouse, friends gave Lee a gift of a year's wages with a note: "You have one year off from your job to write whatever you please. Merry Christmas."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/12/harper-lee-my-christmas-in-new-york|title=Harper Lee: my Christmas in New York|first=Harper|last=Lee|date=December 12, 2015|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>

===Origin===
[[File:To Kill a Mockingbird (first edition cover).jpg|thumb|The first edition cover for ''To Kill a Mockingbird'']]
In the spring of 1957, a 31-year-old Lee delivered the manuscript for ''Go Set a Watchman'' to Crain to send out to publishers, including the now-defunct [[J. B. Lippincott Company]], which eventually bought it.<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/13/books/the-invisible-hand-behind-harper-lees-to-kill-a-mockingbird.html|title=The Invisible Hand Behind Harper Lee's 'To Kill A Mockingbird'|first=Jonathan|last=Mahler|work=The New York Times|date=July 12, 2015|access-date=December 15, 2015}}</ref> At Lippincott, the novel fell into the hands of Therese von Hohoff Torrey—known professionally as [[Tay Hohoff]]. Hohoff was impressed. "[T]he spark of the true writer flashed in every line", she would later recount in a corporate history of Lippincott.<ref name="nytimes.com"/> But as Hohoff saw it, the manuscript was by no means fit for publication. It was, as she described it, "more a series of anecdotes than a fully conceived novel".<ref name="nytimes.com"/> During the next couple of years, she led Lee from one draft to the next until the book finally achieved its finished form and was retitled ''To Kill a Mockingbird''.<ref name="nytimes.com"/> Meanwhile, interest in racial relations in the South had increased nationally as the U.S. Supreme Court had issued its school desegregation decisions in [[Brown v. Board of Education]] in 1954, and the civil rights movement as well as the segregationist "[[massive resistance]]" strategy made headlines across the nation.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Like many unpublished authors, Lee was unsure of her talents. "I was a first-time writer, so I did as I was told," Lee said in a statement in 2015 about the evolution from ''Watchman'' to ''Mockingbird''.<ref name="nytimes.com"/> Hohoff later described the process in Lippincott's corporate history: "After a couple of false starts, the story-line, interplay of characters, and fall of emphasis grew clearer, and with each revision—there were many minor changes as the story grew in strength and in her own vision of it—the true stature of the novel became evident." (In 1978, Lippincott was acquired by [[Harper & Row]], which became [[HarperCollins]] which published ''Watchman'' in 2015.)<ref name="nytimes.com"/> Hohoff described the give and take between author and editor: "When she disagreed with a suggestion, we talked it out, sometimes for hours" ... "And sometimes she came around to my way of thinking, sometimes I to hers, sometimes the discussion would open up an entirely new line of country."<ref name="nytimes.com"/>{{external media| float = right| video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?326872-1/after-words-charles-shields ''After Words'' interview with Shields on ''Mockingbird: A Portrait of Harper Lee'', July 11, 2015], [[C-SPAN]]}} One winter night, as [[Charles J. Shields]] recounts in ''Mockingbird: A Portrait of Harper Lee'', Lee threw her manuscript out her window and into the snow, before calling Hohoff in tears. Shields recollected that "Tay told her to march outside immediately and pick up the pages".<ref name="nytimes.com"/>

When the novel was finally ready, the author opted to use the name "Harper Lee", rather than risk having her first name Nelle be misidentified as "Nellie".<ref>{{cite news |last=Maslin |first=Janet |title=A Biography of Harper Lee, Author of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/08/books/08masl.html |access-date=November 30, 2014 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 8, 2006}}</ref>

Published July 11, 1960, ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' was an immediate bestseller and won great critical acclaim, including the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] in 1961. It remains a bestseller, with more than 40 million copies in print. In 1999, it was voted "Best Novel of the Century" in a poll by the ''[[Library Journal]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=1960, To Kill a Mockingbird |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americannovel/timeline/tokillamockingbird.html |publisher=PBS |access-date=November 30, 2014}}</ref>

===Autobiographical details in the novel===
Like Lee, the tomboy Scout of the novel is the daughter of a respected small-town Alabama attorney. Scout's friend, Dill, was inspired by Lee's childhood friend and neighbor, [[Truman Capote]];<ref name=shields>{{cite book |last=Shields |first=Charles J. |title=Mockingbird: A Portrait of Harper Lee |year=2006 |publisher=Henry Holt and Co. |isbn=9780805083194 |url=https://archive.org/details/mockingbird00char |url-access=registration |access-date=February 19, 2016}}</ref> Lee, in turn, is the model for a character in Capote's first novel, ''[[Other Voices, Other Rooms (novel)|Other Voices, Other Rooms]]'', published in 1948. Although the plot of Lee's novel involves an unsuccessful legal defense similar to one undertaken by her attorney father, the 1931 landmark [[Scottsboro Boys]] interracial rape case may also have helped to shape Lee's social conscience.<ref>{{cite book |author=Johnson, Claudia Durst |title=To Kill a Mockingbird'': Threatening Boundaries |publisher=Twayne |year=1994}}</ref>

While Lee herself downplayed autobiographical parallels in the book, Truman Capote, mentioning the character Boo Radley in ''To Kill a Mockingbird'', described details he considered autobiographical: "In my original version of ''Other Voices, Other Rooms'' I had that same man living in the house that used to leave things in the trees, and then I took that out. He was a real man, and he lived just down the road from us. We used to go and get those things out of the trees. Everything she wrote about it is absolutely true. But you see, I take the same thing and transfer it into some [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] dream, done in an entirely different way."<ref>{{cite book |last=Nance |first=William |title=The Worlds of Truman Capote |location=New York |publisher=Stein & Day |year=1970 |page=223}}</ref>

==After ''To Kill a Mockingbird''==

===Middle years===
Lee lived part-time for 40 years at 433 East 82nd Street in [[Manhattan]], near her childhood friend Capote,<ref>Oleksinski, Johnny. Find out if New York's greatest writers lived next door. ''The New York Post'' April 14, 2017, https://nypost.com/2017/04/14/find-out-if-new-yorks-greatest-writers-lived-next-door/ Accessed April 14, 2017</ref> whose first novel, the semi-autobiographical ''[[Other Voices, Other Rooms (novel)|Other Voices, Other Rooms]]'' had been published in 1948; a decade later Capote published ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (novel)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'', and over the next decade it would become a film, musical and two stage plays. As the ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' manuscript went into publication production in 1959, Lee accompanied Capote to [[Holcomb, Kansas]], to help him research what they thought would be an article on a small town's response to the murder of a farmer and his family. Capote would expand the material into his best-selling book, ''[[In Cold Blood]]'', serialized beginning in September 1965 and published in 1966.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McAvoy |first1=Gary |title=The Origins of In Cold Blood, a Classic Tale of an Iconic American Crime |url=https://medium.com/@garymcavoy/the-origins-of-in-cold-blood-a-classic-tale-of-an-iconic-american-crime-4599af2d206b |website=Medium |access-date=February 19, 2021 |language=en |date=September 24, 2019|quote=Serialized in four consecutive issues of The New Yorker magazine beginning September 25, 1965, “In Cold Blood” was a huge sensation, selling out all copies published. By January 1966, the critical reviews were so strong that the initial print run of some 240,000 hardcover copies flew off the shelves.}}</ref>

''To Kill a Mockingbird'' officially appeared on July 11, 1960, and Lee began a whirlwind of publicity tours, etc., which she found difficult given her penchant for privacy and many interviewers' characterization of the work as a "coming-of-age story".<ref name="Cep p">Cep p.</ref><ref>Anderson pp. 337–338</ref> Moreover, as the book (about racial relations in the 1930s) progressed through the production process, racial tensions in the South had increased. The [[Montgomery bus boycott]] occurred in 1955–1956, and students at North Carolina A&T University staged the first sit-in months before publication. As the book became a best seller, [[Freedom Riders]] arrived in Alabama and were beaten in Anniston and Birmingham. Meanwhile, ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' won the 1961 Pulitzer prize for fiction and the 1961 Brotherhood Award from the National Conference of Christians and Jews, and became a Reader's Digest Book Club condensed selection and an alternate Book of the Month Club selection.<ref>Anderson p. 341</ref>

Lee helped with the adaption of the book to the [[35th Academy Awards|1962 Academy Award]]–winning screenplay by [[Horton Foote]], and approved of the result: "I think it is one of the best translations of a book to film ever made."<ref name=Gregarious>{{cite news |first=Ginia |last=Bellafante |author-link=Ginia Bellafante |title=Harper Lee, Gregarious for a Day |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/30/books/30lee.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 30, 2006 |access-date=August 3, 2008}}</ref> She also escorted lead actor [[Gregory Peck]] around town. Peck [[35th Academy Awards|won]] an [[Oscar award|Oscar]] for his portrayal of [[Atticus Finch]], the father of the novel's narrator, Scout. The families became close; Peck's grandson, Harper Peck Voll, is named after her.<ref>{{cite news |first=Irene |last=Lacher |author-link=Irene Lacher |title=Harper Lee raises her low profile for a friend |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/may/21/entertainment/et-harper21 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=May 21, 2005 |access-date=March 3, 2017}}</ref>

Initially, Lee tried to answer personally correspondence from fans, but when she began receiving more than 60 letters daily, she realized the demands on her time were too great. Her sister Alice became her lawyer, and Lee obtained an unlisted telephone number to reduce distractions from many people seeking interviews or public appearances. From the time of the publication of ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' until her death in 2016, Lee granted almost no requests for interviews or public appearances and, with the exception of a few short essays, published nothing further until 2015. She did work on a follow-up novel—''The Long Goodbye''—but eventually filed it away unfinished.<ref name="WritersStory">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/a-writers-story-the-mockingbird-mystery-480965.html |title=A writer's story: The mockingbird mystery |access-date=August 3, 2008 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=June 4, 2006}}</ref>

Lee also assumed significant care responsibilities for her father, who was thrilled with her success, and even began signing autographs as "Atticus Finch".<ref name="Cep p"/> However, his health worsened and he died in Alabama on April 15, 1962. She decided to spend more time in New York City as she mourned, but over the decades her friend Capote became embroiled in a flamboyant jet-set lifestyle far from her preference for anonymity and a more spartan lifestyle. Lee preferred to visit friends at their homes (though she came to distance herself from those who criticized her drinking),<ref name="Cep p"/> and also made unannounced appearances at libraries or other gatherings, particularly in Monroeville.<ref>Anderson p. 242</ref>

In January 1966, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] appointed Lee to the [[National Endowment for the Arts|National Council on the Arts]].<ref>{{cite news |title=26 to Be Advisory Board for National Endowment |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B01E0DC1F3BEF34BC4051DFB766838D679EDE |access-date=November 30, 2014 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 28, 1966 |quote=In a parallel development to- day, the President appointed Harper Lee, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning "To Kill a Mockingbird." and Richard Diebenkorn, artist, to the National Council on the Arts.}}</ref>

Lee also realized that her book had become controversial, particularly with segregationists and other opponents of the civil rights movement. In 1966, Lee wrote a letter to the editor in response to the attempts of a [[Richmond, Virginia]], area [[school board]] to ban ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' as "immoral literature":

{{quote|Surely it is plain to the simplest intelligence that ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' spells out in words of seldom more than two syllables a code of honor and conduct, Christian in its ethic, that is the heritage of all Southerners. To hear that the novel is 'immoral' has made me count the years between now and 1984, for I have yet to come across a better example of [[doublethink]].<ref name=shields/>}}

[[James J. Kilpatrick]], editor of ''[[The Richmond News Leader]]'', started the Beadle Bumble fund to pay fines for victims of what he termed "despots on the bench". He built the fund using contributions from readers and later used it to defend books as well as people. After the board in Richmond ordered schools to dispose of all copies of ''To Kill a Mockingbird'', Kilpatrick wrote, "A more moral novel scarcely could be imagined." In the name of the Beadle Bumble fund, he then offered free copies to children who wrote in, and by the end of the first week, he had given away 81 copies.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,835072,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028164133/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,835072,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 28, 2010 |title=Newspapers: Spoofing the Despots |journal=Time |date=January 21, 1966 |access-date=April 29, 2011}}</ref>

Beginning in 1978, with her sisters' encouragement, Lee returned to Alabama and began a factual book about an Alabama serial murderer and the trial of his killer in [[Alexander City, Alabama|Alexander City]], under the working title ''The Reverend'', but also put it aside when she was not satisfied.<ref name="WritersStory"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/birmingham-news-stories/2010/11/in_search_of_harper_lee.html |title=In search of Harper Lee |publisher=AL.com |first=Kathy |last=Kemp |date=November 10, 2010}}</ref>

On May 7, 2006, Lee wrote a letter to [[Oprah Winfrey]] (published in ''[[O, The Oprah Magazine]]'' in July 2006) about her love of books as a child and her dedication to the written word: "Now, 75 years later in an abundant society where people have laptops, cell phones, iPods and minds like empty rooms, I still plod along with books."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/26/AR2006062601039.html |title=Harper Lee Writes Rare Item for O Magazine |date=June 26, 2006 |newspaper=The Washington Post |agency=Associated Press}}</ref>

[[File:Harper Lee Medal.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Lee being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, November 5, 2007]]
On November 5, 2007, [[George W. Bush]] presented Lee with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]]. This is the highest civilian award in the United States and recognizes individuals who have made "an especially meritorious contribution to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, cultural or other significant public or private endeavors".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2007/11/harper_lee_given_presidential.html |title=Harper Lee given Presidential Medal of Freedom |newspaper=[[The Birmingham News]] |date=November 5, 2007 |first=Virginia |last=Martin}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7080382.stm |title=Author Lee receives top US honour |work=BBC News |date=November 6, 2007}}</ref>

In a 2011 interview with an Australian newspaper, Rev. Dr. Thomas Lane Butts said Lee now lived in an [[assisted-living]] facility, was using a wheelchair, partially blind and deaf, and suffering from memory loss. Butts also shared that Lee told him why she never wrote again: "Two reasons: one, I wouldn't go through the pressure and publicity I went through with ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' for any amount of money. Second, I have said what I wanted to say, and I will not say it again."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/the-town-where-a-mockingbird-lives/story-fn6b3v4f-1226104905164 |title=Miss Nelle in Monroeville |first=Paul |last=Toohey |date=July 31, 2011 |access-date=August 8, 2011 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |location=Sydney, NSW, Australia}}</ref>

On May 3, 2013, Lee had filed a lawsuit in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|United States District Court]] to regain the [[copyright]] to ''To Kill a Mockingbird'', seeking unspecified damages from a son-in-law of her former literary agent and related entities. Lee claimed that the man "engaged in a scheme to dupe" her into assigning him the copyright on the book in 2007 when her hearing and eyesight were in decline, and she was residing in an assisted-living facility after having suffered a stroke.<ref name=bloomberg>{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-03/-to-kill-a-mockingbird-author-files-suit-over-copyright.html |title=Harper Lee Sues Agent Over 'Mockingbird' Royalties |first1=Don |last1=Jeffrey |first2=Bob |last2=Van Voris |date=May 3, 2013 |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title='Mockingbird' author Lee sues over copyright in NY |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/mockingbird-author-lee-sues-over-copyright-ny |agency=AP |access-date=May 4, 2013}}</ref><ref name="reuters">{{cite news |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/entertainment-us-usa-mockingbird-lawsuit-idINBRE94210Z20130503/ |title='To Kill a Mockingbird' author Lee sues her agent over copyright |work=[[Reuters]] |date=May 4, 2013}}</ref> In September 2013, attorneys for both sides announced a settlement of the lawsuit.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/09/06/mockingbird-lawsuit-settlement/2778479/K |title=Harper Lee settles 'To Kill a Mockingbird' suit |first=Cara |last=Matthews |newspaper=USA Today |date=September 6, 2013}}</ref>

In February 2014, Lee settled a lawsuit against the [[Monroe County, Alabama|Monroe County]] Heritage Museum for an undisclosed amount. The suit alleged that the museum had used her name and the title ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' to promote itself and to sell souvenirs without her consent.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26271278 |title=Harper Lee settles legal action against Alabama museum |work=BBC News |date=February 20, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |work=Reuters |title=Town dependent on fame of Harper Lee book stung by museum lawsuit |author=Gates, Verna Gates |location=Monroeville, Alabama |date=November 2, 2013 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-alabama-harperlee-idUSBRE9A108B20131102}}</ref> Lee's attorneys had filed a trademark application on August 19, 2013, to which the museum filed an opposition.

===2015: ''Go Set a Watchman''===
According to Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter, following an initial meeting to appraise Lee's assets in 2011, she re-examined Lee's safe-deposit box in 2014 and found the manuscript for ''[[Go Set a Watchman]]''. After contacting Lee and reading the manuscript, she passed it on to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-i-found-the-harper-lee-manuscript-1436740810|title=How I Found the Harper Lee Manuscript|first=Tonja B. |last=Carter|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=July 12, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/13/harper-lee-third-novel-lawyer-tonja-carter|title=Harper Lee may have written a third novel, lawyer suggests |first=Alison |last=Flood|date=July 13, 2015|work=The Guardian}}</ref>

On February 3, 2015, it was announced that HarperCollins would publish ''Go Set a Watchman'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://corporate.harpercollins.com/us/press-releases/425/RECENTLY%20DISCOVERED%20NOVEL%20FROM%20HARPER%20LEE,%20AUTHOR%20OF%20TO%20KILL%20A%20MOCKINGBIRD |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203171358/http://corporate.harpercollins.com/us/press-releases/425/RECENTLY%20DISCOVERED%20NOVEL%20FROM%20HARPER%20LEE,%20AUTHOR%20OF%20TO%20KILL%20A%20MOCKINGBIRD |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 3, 2015 |title=Recently Discovered Novel From Harper Lee, Author of To Kill a Mockingbird }}</ref> which includes versions of many of the characters in ''To Kill a Mockingbird''. According to a HarperCollins press release, it was originally thought that the ''Watchman'' manuscript was lost.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/04/books/harper-lee-author-of-to-kill-a-mockingbird-is-to-publish-a-new-novel.html|title=Harper Lee, Author of 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' Is to Publish a Second Novel|first=Alexandra|last=Alter|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 3, 2015|access-date=February 3, 2015}}</ref> According to Nurnberg, ''Mockingbird'' was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: "They discussed publishing Mockingbird first, Watchman last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/05/harper-lee-to-kill-a-mockingbird-sequel-go-set-a-watchman|title=Harper Lee's 'lost' novel was intended to complete a trilogy, says agent|author=Alison Flood|date=February 5, 2015|work=The Guardian}}</ref>

Jonathan Mahler's account in ''[[The New York Times]]'' of how ''Watchman'' was only ever really considered to be the first draft of ''Mockingbird'' makes this assertion seem unlikely.<ref name="nytimes.com"/> Evidence where the same passages exist in both books, in many cases word for word, also further refutes this assertion.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://qz.com/452650/harper-lee-revisions|title=See where 'Go Set A Watchman' overlaps with 'To Kill A Mockingbird' word for word|first1=Keith|last1=Collins |first2=Nikhil|last2=Sonnad|work=Quartz|date=July 14, 2015|access-date=December 15, 2015}}</ref>

The book was controversially<ref name="ReferenceA"/> published in July 2015 as a sequel to ''To Kill a Mockingbird'', though it has been confirmed to be the first draft of the latter, with many narrative incongruities, repackaged and released as a completely separate work.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The book is set some 20 years after the time period depicted in ''Mockingbird'', when [[Scout Finch|Scout]] returns as an adult from New York to visit her father in Maycomb, Alabama.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://corporate.harpercollins.com/us/press-releases/425/RECENTLY%20DISCOVERED%20NOVEL%20FROM%20HARPER%20LEE,%20AUTHOR%20OF%20TO%20KILL%20A%20MOCKINGBIRD |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203171358/http://corporate.harpercollins.com/us/press-releases/425/RECENTLY%20DISCOVERED%20NOVEL%20FROM%20HARPER%20LEE,%20AUTHOR%20OF%20TO%20KILL%20A%20MOCKINGBIRD |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 3, 2015 |title=Recently Discovered Novel from Harper Lee, Author of To Kill a Mockingbird |date=February 3, 2015 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers }}</ref> It alludes to Scout's view of her father, [[Atticus Finch]], as the moral compass ("watchman") of Maycomb,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al.com/living/index.ssf/2015/02/go_set_a_watchman_whats_the_bi.html|title='Go Set a Watchman': What does Harper Lee's book title mean?|work=AL.com|access-date=February 6, 2015|first=Greg |last=Garrison|date=February 5, 2015}}</ref> and, according to the publisher, how she finds upon her return to Maycomb, that she "is forced to grapple with issues both personal and political as she tries to understand her father's attitude toward society and her own feelings about the place where she was born and spent her childhood."<ref name=abc>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/harper-lee-published-july-28687808|title=Second Harper Lee Novel to Be Published in July |publisher=ABC News|access-date=February 3, 2015}}</ref>

Not all reviewers have such a harsh opinion about the publication of the sequel book.

Though it lacks the lyricism... the portions of "Watchman" dealing with Scout's childhood and her adult romance with Henry capture the daily rhythms of life in a small town and are peppered with portraits of minor characters" and she mentions that "Students of writing will find 'Watchman' fascinating." While not fully praising the book she finds the publication of "Watchman" an important step stone in understanding Harper Lee's work.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

The publication of the novel (announced by her lawyer) raised concerns over why Lee, who for 55 years had maintained that she would never write another book, would suddenly choose to publish again. In February 2015, the State of Alabama, through its Human Resources Department, launched an investigation into whether Lee was [[Competence (law)|competent]] enough to consent to the publishing of ''Go Set a Watchman''.<ref name="KovaleskiNYTimes"/> The investigation found that the claims of coercion and [[elder abuse]] were unfounded,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/2015-04-04/review-rejects-claims-author-harper-lee-was-coerced-into-publishing-second-book-go-set-a-watchman/1433310|title=Review rejects claims author Harper Lee was coerced into publishing second book 'Go Set A Watchman'|publisher=Radio Australia|date=April 4, 2015|access-date=December 15, 2015}}</ref> and, according to Lee's lawyer, Lee was "happy as hell" with the publication.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/to-shill-a-mockingbird-how-the-discovery-of-a-manuscript-became-harper-lees-new-novel/2015/02/16/48656f76-b3b9-11e4-886b-c22184f27c35_story.html |title=To shill a mockingbird: How a manuscript's discovery became Harper Lee's 'new' novel |work=The Washington Post |last=Tucker |first=Neely |author-link=Neely Tucker |date=February 16, 2015 |quote=Lee, in a statement released by Carter, said she was "happy as hell" that it was finally being published.

She made note that ''Watchman'' was announced just two and a half months after Alice's death and that all correspondence to and from Lee went through her new attorney. She described Lee as "in a wheelchair in an assisted living center, nearly deaf and blind, with a uniformed guard posted at the door" and her visitors "restricted to those on an approved list."<ref name="washingtonpost.com"/>

''The New York Times'' columnist Joe Nocera continued this argument.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> He also took issue with how the book was promoted by the 'Murdoch Empire' as a "newly discovered" novel, attesting that the other people in the Sothebys meeting insisted that Lee's attorney was present in 2011, when Lee's former agent (who was subsequently fired) and the Sotheby's specialist found the manuscript. They said she knew full well that it was the same one submitted to Tay Hohoff in the 1950s that was reworked into ''Mockingbird'', and that Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter had been sitting on the discovery, waiting for the moment when she, and not Alice, would be in charge of Harper Lee's affairs.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The authorship of both "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "Go Set a Watchman" was investigated with the help of forensic linguistics and stylometry. In a study conducted by three Polish academics, Michał Choiński, Maciej Edera and Jan Rybicki, the authorial fingerprints of Lee, Hohoff and Capote were contrasted to prove that "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "Go Set a Watchman" were both written by the same person.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/747862|title=Harper Lee and Other People: A Stylometric Diagnosis|first1=Michał|last1=Choiński|first2=Maciej|last2=Eder|first3=Jan|last3=Rybicki|date=April 28, 2017|journal=Mississippi Quarterly|volume=70|issue=3|pages=355–374|via=Project MUSE|doi=10.1353/mss.2017.0022}}</ref> However, their study also suggests that Capote could have helped Lee with the writing of the opening chapters of "To Kill a Mockingbird".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.lsupress.org/michal-choinski-talks-about-stylometry/|title=Michał Choiński Talks about Stylometry|date=June 10, 2020}}</ref>

After her death, ''The New York Times'' filed a lawsuit that argued that since Lee's will was filed in a probate court in Alabama that it should be part of the public record.
