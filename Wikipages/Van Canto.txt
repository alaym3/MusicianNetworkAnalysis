'''Van Canto''' (sometimes stylized as '''van Canto''') is a German [[a cappella]] [[Heavy metal music|metal]] band, founded in 2006 and composed of six singers and a drummer. Although the group is often classified as an a cappella ensemble, they use real drums in their music, instead of vocal [[percussion]] or [[beatboxing]].

Van Canto play a cappella with [[Traditional heavy metal|classic heavy]], [[power metal|power]] and [[symphonic metal]] influence, creating what they call "hero metal a cappella". While only two of the six singers perform the lead vocals, the other four instead use their voices to imitate the guitars and the bass, with the help of amplifiers, in an attempt to sound closer to the original instruments.
