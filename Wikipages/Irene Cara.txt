Cara sang and co-wrote the song "[[Flashdance... What a Feeling]]" (from the film ''[[Flashdance]]''), for which she won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1984|title=The 56th Academy Awards {{pipe}} 1984|website=Oscars.org {{pipe}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}</ref> and a [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awardsandshows.com/features/best-female-pop-vocals-348.html|title=Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance – Grammys Best Female Pop Vocal Performance |website=Awardsandshows.com}}</ref> in 1984. Cara is also known for playing the role of Coco Hernandez in the 1980 film ''[[Fame (1980 film)|Fame]]'', and for recording the film's title song "[[Fame (Irene Cara song)|Fame]]". Prior to her success with ''Fame'', Cara portrayed the title character Sparkle Williams in the original 1976 musical drama film ''[[Sparkle (1976 film)|Sparkle]]''.

==Early life==
Cara was born in [[The Bronx]], New York City, the youngest of five children.<ref name=people>{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20077840,00.html|title=After 16 Years in Showbiz, Irene Cara, 21, Gets Her Diploma in Movies with Fame|last=Sheff|first=David |work=People|date=November 10, 1980|access-date=June 18, 2016}}</ref> Her father, Gaspar Escalera, a factory worker and retired saxophonist, was [[Stateside Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]],<ref name=people/> and her mother, Louise, a movie theater usher, was Cuban-American. Cara has two sisters and two brothers. At the age of three, Irene Cara was one of five finalists for the "Little Miss America" pageant. She began to play the piano [[Playing by ear|by ear]], then studied music, acting, and dance seriously, first having dance lessons, aged five.<ref name=people/> Her performing career started on Spanish-language television, professionally singing and dancing. She made early TV appearances on ''[[The Original Amateur Hour]]'' (singing in Spanish)<ref name=Ola>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PrOgQe6lfA Irene Cara singing "Ola Ola Ola"] on Ted Mack's "Amateur Hour"</ref> and [[Johnny Carson]]'s ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. In 1971–1972, she was a regular on PBS's educational program ''[[The Electric Company]]'', as a member of the show's band, The Short Circus.<ref name=people/> As a child, Cara recorded a Latin-market Spanish-language record and an English Christmas album. She appeared in a major concert tribute to [[Duke Ellington]] that featured [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], and [[Roberta Flack]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://irenecara.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Irene-Cara-Print-Bio.pdf|title=Irene Cara Bio|access-date=March 30, 2021|page=2}}</ref>

Cara appeared in on-and off-Broadway theatrical shows including the musicals ''[[Ain't Misbehavin' (musical)|Ain't Misbehavin']]'', ''[[The Me Nobody Knows]]'' (which won an [[Obie Award]]), ''[[Maggie Flynn]]'' opposite [[Shirley Jones]] and [[Jack Cassidy]], and ''[[Via Galactica]]'' with [[Raúl Juliá]]. Cara was the original Daisy Allen on the 1970s daytime serial ''Love of Life.'' Next came her role as Angela in romance/thriller ''[[Aaron Loves Angela]],'' followed by her portrayal of the title character in ''[[Sparkle (1976 film)|Sparkle]].'' Television brought Cara international acclaim for serious dramatic roles in two outstanding mini-series, ''[[Roots: The Next Generations]]'' and ''[[Guyana Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones]].'' ''John Willis' Screen World'', Vol. 28, named her one of twelve "Promising New Actors of 1976"; that same year, a readers' poll in ''[[Right On! (magazine)|Right On!]]'' magazine named her Top Actress. Cara graduated from the [[Professional Children's School]] in Manhattan.

===''Fame'' (1980) and international acclaim===
The 1980 hit movie ''[[Fame (1980 film)|Fame]],'' directed by [[Alan Parker]], catapulted Irene Cara to stardom. Cara was originally cast as a dancer, but when producers David Da Silva and Alan Marshall and screenwriter Christopher Gore heard her voice, they re-wrote the role of Coco Hernandez. As Coco Hernandez, she sang both the title song "[[Fame (Irene Cara song)|Fame]]" and the film's other single, "[[Out Here on My Own]]." These songs helped make the film's soundtrack a chart-topping, multi-platinum album. Further history was made at the [[Academy Awards]] that year: it was the first time two songs from the same film were nominated in the same category and both sung by the same artist. Thus, Cara had the opportunity to be one of the few singers to perform more than one song at the Oscar ceremony; "Fame," written by [[Michael Gore]] and [[Dean Pitchford]], won the award that year. Cara earned [[Grammy]] nominations in 1980 for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, as well as a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for Best Motion Picture Actress in a Musical. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' named her Top New Single Artist, while ''[[Cashbox Magazine]]'' awarded her both Most Promising Female Vocalist and Top Female Vocalist. Asked by ''[[Fame (1982 TV series)|Fame]]'' TV series' producers to reprise her role as Coco Hernandez, she declined so as to focus her attention on her recording career. As a result, [[Erica Gimpel]] assumed the role.

===Post-''Fame'' 1980–1999===
{{more citations needed|section|date=June 2020}}
Cara was slated to star in her own sitcom, ''Irene'', on NBC in 1981. Even though the pilot aired and received favorable reviews, the network did not pick it up for its fall season. It also starred veteran performers [[Kaye Ballard]] and [[Theodore Wilson|Teddy Wilson]], as well as newcomers [[Julia Duffy]] and [[Keenen Ivory Wayans]]. In 1983, Cara appeared as herself in the film ''[[D.C. Cab]]'', which is a film about a group of cabbies. The movie stars [[Mr. T]]. One of the characters, Tyrone, played by [[Charlie Barnett (comedian)|Charlie Barnett]], is an obsessed Cara fan who decorated his [[Checker Cab]] as a shrine to her. Her contribution to the film's soundtrack, "The Dream (Hold on To Your Dream)" played over the closing credits of the film, and was a minor hit, peaking at No.&nbsp;37 on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1984.

In 1982, Cara earned the [[Image Award]] for [[NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Television Movie, Mini-Series or Dramatic Special|Best Actress]] when she co-starred with [[Diahann Carroll]] and [[Rosalind Cash]] in the [[NBC]] Movie of the Week, [[Maya Angelou]]'s ''[[Sister, Sister (1982 film)|Sister, Sister]]''. Cara portrayed [[Myrlie Evers-Williams]] in the [[PBS]] TV movie about [[civil rights]] leader [[Medgar Evers]], ''[[For Us the Living: The Medgar Evers Story]]''; and earned an [[NAACP]] [[Image Award]] Best Actress nomination. She also appeared in 1982's ''Killing 'em Softly''. In addition to her music and film work, Cara also continued to perform in live theater during this period. In the summer of 1980, she briefly played the role of ''Dorothy'' in ''[[The Wiz]]'' on tour, in a role that [[Stephanie Mills]] had first portrayed in the original Broadway production. Coincidentally, Cara and Mills had shared the stage together as children in the original 1968 Broadway musical ''[[Maggie Flynn]]'', starring [[Shirley Jones]] and [[Jack Cassidy]], in which both young girls played [[American Civil War|Civil War]] orphans.

In 1983, Cara reached the peak<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/irene-cara/chart-history|title=Chart History Irene Cara|access-date=March 30, 2021}}</ref> of her music career with the title song for the movie ''[[Flashdance]]'': "Flashdance... What A Feeling", which she co-wrote with [[Giorgio Moroder]] and [[Keith Forsey]]. Cara penned the lyrics to the song with Keith Forsey while riding in a car in New York heading to the studio to record it; Moroder composed the music. Cara admitted later that she was initially reluctant to work with Giorgio Moroder because she had no wish to invite further comparisons with another artist who worked with Moroder, [[Donna Summer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&p_docid=0EB35DCAF8F94960&p_docnum=48&p_queryname=NaN&p_product=NewsBank&p_theme=aggregated4&p_nbid=F70U5FEXMTE4NTMwODUxNC4zOTgxMDA6MTo2Om5jZGNwbA|title=NewsBank InfoWeb|website=Infoweb.newsbank.com}}</ref> But the collaboration paid off and became a hit in several countries, garnering numerous accolades for Cara. She won the 1983 [[Academy Award for Best Song]] (Oscar), 1984 [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]], 1984 [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]], and [[American Music Award]]s for Best R&B Female Artist and Best Pop Single of the Year. Cara's Oscar win made her the first hispanic-black woman to win an Oscar in a category other than an acting category, as well as only the second to be nominated outside of an acting category. "Flashdance..." was re-recorded by Cara twice: in 1997 as a track in the original soundtrack for the British film ''[[The Full Monty]]''; the second time in 2002, as a duet with Swiss artist [[DJ BoBo]].

In 1984, she was in the comedic thriller ''[[City Heat]]'', co-starring opposite [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Burt Reynolds]] and singing the standards "[[Embraceable You]]" and "[[Get Happy (song)|Get Happy]]." She also co-wrote the theme song "City Heat", which was sung by the jazz vocalist [[Joe Williams (jazz singer)|Joe Williams]]. In May of that year, she scored her final Top 40 hit with "[[Breakdance (song)|Breakdance]]" going to No. 8. The follow up, "[[You Were Made for Me (Irene Cara song)|You Were Made for Me]]" reached No. 78 that summer but then she never charted on the Hot 100 again. In 1985, Cara co-starred with [[Tatum O'Neal]] in ''[[Certain Fury]]'', an exploitation underachiever about two troubled young women who flee a court hearing and are mistaken for killers. In 1986, Cara appeared in the film ''Busted Up''. She also provided the voice of [[Snow White]] in the unofficial sequel to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', [[Filmation]]'s ''[[Happily Ever After (1993 film)|Happily Ever After]]'', in 1993. That same year, she appeared as Mary Magdalene in a tour of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' opposite [[Ted Neeley]], [[Carl Anderson (singer)|Carl Anderson]] and [[Dennis DeYoung]].

Along with her career in acting and hit singles, Cara released several albums: ''[[Anyone Can See]]'' in 1982, ''[[What a Feelin']]'' in 1983, and ''[[Carasmatic]]'' in 1987, the most successful of these being ''What a Feelin''. In 1985, she collaborated with the Hispanic [[charity supergroup]] Hermanos in the song "[[Cantaré, cantarás]]," in which she sang a solo segment with the Spanish opera singer Plácido Domingo.

Cara toured Europe and Asia throughout the 1990s, achieving several modest dance hits on European charts, but no US chart hits. She released a compilation of [[Eurodance]] singles in the mid to late 1990s entitled ''Precarious 90's''.

Cara has also worked as a backup vocalist for [[Vicki Sue Robinson]], [[Lou Reed]], [[George Duke]], [[Oleta Adams]], and [[Evelyn "Champagne" King]].

===21st century===
In March 2004, Cara received two honors with an induction into the Ciboney Cafe's Hall of Fame and a Lifetime Achievement Award presented at the sixth annual Prestige Awards. In June 2005, Cara won the third round of the NBC television series ''[[Hit Me, Baby, One More Time (TV series)|Hit Me, Baby, One More Time]]'', performing "Flashdance (What a Feeling)" and covered [[Anastacia]]'s song "I'm Outta Love" with her current all-female band, Hot Caramel. At the [[2006 AFL Grand Final]] in [[Melbourne]], Cara performed "Flashdance (What a Feeling)" as an opener to the pre-match entertainment.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gibson|first=Jano|date=2006-09-30|title=Last ditch bid for tickets|url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/afl/last-ditch-bid-for-tickets-20061001-gdoi40.html|access-date=2021-11-14|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en}}</ref>

In 2006, Cara contributed a dance single, titled "Forever My Love", to the compilation album titled ''Gay Happening Vol. 12''.

{{as of|2016}}, Cara divided her residence between [[New Port Richey, Florida]] and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]. She works with her band Hot Caramel, which she formed in 1999.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://people.com/archive/ready-for-an-encore-vol-56-no-2/|title=Ready for an Encore|work=People|date=July 9, 2001|access-date=February 1, 2021}}</ref> Their album called ''Irene Cara Presents Hot Caramel'' was released on April 4, 2011. Cara appeared in season 2 of CMT's reality show ''[[Gone Country (television series)|Gone Country]],''.
