==2016==
After touring the US in the spring of 2016, Weatherbox played their last show on Tuesday, August 16, 2016 at Che Café in La Jolla, CA.  However, there's speculation from some fans that they may play shows or continue writing at some later point in time, based on the title of their last show, "Goodbye For Now Show".  But as of Wednesday, August 17, 2016, Weatherbox is no longer a band.  The entire show was streamed live on Facebook and can be viewed on their page for all those who were not able to attend.

==Late 2018, early 2019==
After a hiatus, Brian Warren began posting to the Weatherbox Instagram in late 2018, with a special New Year's Eve show at the Soda Bar. Weatherbox then released a live video of a new song via Halfway Home called "Smelly" on February 11, 2019. The band's current plans are unknown.
