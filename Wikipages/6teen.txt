==Plot==
''6teen'' is an animated comedy for older children, preteens, and teenagers. The plots take place almost entirely in a megaplex [[shopping mall]] known as the Galleria mall. The Galleria mall is a cross between the [[Toronto Eaton Centre]] and the [[West Edmonton Mall]]. The series follows the cast of six 16-year-old friends in everyday lives, including their first part-time jobs.
The show is rated [[TV Parental Guidelines#TV-PG|TV-PG]].

''6teen'' is focused on the common issues related to teenagers. The main characters are: Jude, Jen, Nikki, Jonesy, Caitlin, and Wyatt. They deal with first [[puppy love|infatuations]], first jobs, first bank accounts, and a sweet taste of freedom. Nikki finds herself stuck working at The Khaki Barn, a store where she would not shop herself, while Jen has found her dream job at a sporting goods store, but makes some mistakes. As a [[running gag]], Jonesy manages to get fired from a new store in almost every episode with a few exceptions. Wyatt falls hopelessly in love with his older co-worker. Jude works at the Food on a stick. Caitlin endures the daily humiliation of working at the lowest store in the mall's hierarchy of cool – The Big Squeeze, a lemonade stand shaped like a giant lemon, where she's required to wear a hat shaped like a lemon as a part of her uniform.

==Production==
''6teen'' is created and directed through the use of a 2D digital software package known as Harmony, which was developed by the [[Toon Boom Animation]] studio in [[Montreal]], Quebec.<ref name="A">{{cite web|url=http://www.mediacastermagazine.com/common_scripts/prv2/print_version.asp?ID=2502|title=6teen Press Release|access-date=June 13, 2007|date=October 12, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930185815/http://www.mediacastermagazine.com/common_scripts/prv2/print_version.asp?ID=2502|archive-date=September 30, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

''6teen'' (the original working title for the series being ''The Mall''){{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} is scripted by a team of writers which includes series creators and directors [[Tom McGillis]] and [[Jennifer Pertsch]], alongside [[Sean Cullen]] (''[[The Sean Cullen Show]]''), and [[George Westerholm]] (''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]''). On the subject of their work, McGillis explained, {{cquote|Our biggest goal was to connect with our audience. What surprised us was not the fact that kids were watching adult sitcoms, but why they were watching them. They recognize and appreciate smart writing. So, although 6TEEN's subject matter is aimed at kids, the writing style is classic sitcom, with fast-paced dialogue, and multiple plot lines.<ref name="A"/>}}

The series' main characters were designed by Brad Coombs. Music composed by Don Breithaupt and Anthony Vanderburgh. There are seven main cast members who voice ''6teen''. [[Brooke D'Orsay]] performs the voice of Caitlin, while Stacey DePass provides the voice of Nikki, [[Megan Fahlenbock]] voices Jen, Jess Gibbons voices Wyatt, [[Christian Potenza]] voices Jude, and [[Terry McGurrin]] voices Jonesy. Jamie Watson provides the voices of Coach Halder and Ron the Rent-a-Cop.

==Reception==
Throughout the show's run, ''6teen'' has received critical acclaim. In the winter/spring of 2005, the program ranked among Teletoons' Top 10 for children ages ten years old and up in both [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] markets in Canada.<ref name="B">{{cite web|author=Corus Entertainment |url=http://www.corusent.com/corporate/press_room/pressReleaseDetail.asp?id=821 |title=Corus Entertainment – News Releases |access-date=June 13, 2007|date=April 14, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225071131/http://www.corusent.com/corporate/press_room/pressReleaseDetail.asp?id=821 |archive-date=February 25, 2007|url-status=live }}</ref> It was also the only Canadian production to be nominated for a Pulcinella Award in 2005 under "TV Series for All Audiences".<ref name="B"/> Furthermore, on June 2, 2007, ''6teen'' received an award from the Alliance for Children and Television for being the best of children's television to fall under the age group of nine to fourteen years old that year.<ref name="C">[[Wikinews:Wikinews Entertainment Shorts: June 2, 2007]]</ref> Carole Bonneau, vice-president in charge of Teletoon's programming, has remarked about ''6teen'':
{{cquote|Aesthetically appealing, with an upbeat musical score, combined with its power to invite empathy from teens towards the main characters, with 6teen Teletoon delivers a series that is a perfect match for today's generation.}}

In Canada, the show garners about 2.5 million viewers each episode. In the United States, 6teen's ratings were around 1.8 million viewers each episode, and ratings held there and then even increased, making it one of Cartoon Network's top shows (October 2008{{spaced ndash}}September 2009). The highest rating 6teen received on Cartoon Network was 3.7 million viewers, on Thursday, June 11, 2009, immediately after the season premiere of Total Drama Action. As time went on (starting in October 2009), 6teen began a slow drop in ratings. The 6teen series finale, which aired on June 21, 2010, received a total of 1.6 million viewers, which is lower than previous 6teen episodes.

In 2009, the show won the Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Original Song (Main Title and Promo) for its theme song, "6teen",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmyonline.org/mediacenter/daytime_36th_creative_winners_fp.html |title=Daytime Entertainment Emmy Awards - Creative Arts Winners Announced |publisher=Emmyonline.org |access-date=December 1, 2013|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124073620/http://www.emmyonline.org/mediacenter/daytime_36th_creative_winners_fp.html |archive-date=November 24, 2012}}</ref> which was performed by Phil Naro.

==Censorship==
Because 6teen was targeted towards a more mature audience ([[preteens]] and [[teenagers]]), certain episodes were considered too risque or inappropriate by the US channels [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Nickelodeon]]. This led to 24 episodes being censored or removed in the [[United States]].<ref>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_6teen_episodes</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2020}} With Canada's legalization of [[same-sex marriage]] occurring around the time of the series' release, many episodes of 6teen included references and innuendos to [[homosexuality]], mostly which were censored in the United States.<ref>https://www.vice.com/amp/en_ca/article/ev7n3z/cult-cartoon-6teen-is-back-in-a-really-weird-way</ref> Other censorships and bans in the United States included a plot line that centered around shoplifting, and nude images that were modified from the series' original blur-out to a full black bar.
