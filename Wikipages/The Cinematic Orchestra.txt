'''The Cinematic Orchestra''' is a British [[nu jazz]] and [[downtempo]] music group created in 1999 by Jason Swinscoe. The group is signed to [[independent record label]] [[Ninja Tune]].

The Cinematic Orchestra have produced four studio albums, ''[[Motion (The Cinematic Orchestra album)|Motion]]'' (1999), ''[[Every Day (album)|Every Day]]'' (2002), ''[[Ma Fleur]]'' (2007) and ''[[To Believe]]'' (2019), and two film soundtrack albums, ''[[Man with a Movie Camera (The Cinematic Orchestra album)|Man with a Movie Camera]]'' (2003) and ''[[The Crimson Wing: Mystery of the Flamingos]]'' (2009).

In addition to Swinscoe, the band includes former [[DJ Food]] member PC (Patrick Carpenter) on [[turntablism|turntables]], Luke Flowers on [[drum kit|drums]], Tom Chant on [[saxophone]], [[Nick Ramm]] on [[piano]], Stuart McCallum on [[guitar]], and Phil France on [[double bass]]. Former members include Jamie Coleman ([[trumpet]]), T. Daniel Howard (drums), [[Federico Ughi]] (drums), Alex James ([[piano]]), and Clean Sadness ([[synthesizer]], programming).

Swinscoe and Carpenter have also recorded together under the band name Neptune.

==Style==
The Cinematic Orchestra's sound, in both live and [[recording studio|studio]] contexts, employs a live band which improvises along with a [[turntablism|turntablist]] and electronic elements such as [[sampling (music)|samples]] provided by Swinscoe. In their studio releases Swinscoe will often [[remix]] the live source material to produce a combination of live jazz [[improvisation]] with [[electronica]],<ref>{{cite news|first1=Interview by Matt|last1=Munday|access-date=2019-04-09|title=Jason Swinscoe: 'I'm not doing this to make a pop song that's on Radio 1 for two weeks'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/nov/13/cinematic-orchestra-jason-swinscoe-q-and-a-to-believe|newspaper=The Observer|date=13 November 2016|issn=0029-7712|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> such that it is difficult to tell where the improvisation ends and the production begins.

==History==
Swinscoe first formed a group called ''Crabladder'' in 1990, whilst studying [[Fine Art]] at [[Cardiff School of Art & Design|Cardiff College]],<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2019-04-09|title=Cinematic Orchestra|url=https://www.atpfestival.com/artist/cinematicorchestra|website=All Tomorrow's Parties}}</ref> releasing one official single on his own ''Power Tools'' label. In 1994, Swinscoe was given a DJ spot on [[Heart FM]], a [[pirate radio station]] in [[south London]].

The Cinematic Orchestra's debut album, ''[[Motion (The Cinematic Orchestra album)|Motion]],'' was released in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2019-04-09|title=The Cinematic Orchestra: Motion|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1467-motion/|website=Pitchfork}}</ref> The critical success of that album led to them being asked to perform at the [[Directors Guild of Great Britain|Director's Guild Awards]] ceremony for the presentation of the Lifetime Achievement Award to film director [[Stanley Kubrick]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/Interviews/FromTheMagazine/cinematic_orchestrascore|title=The Cinematic Orchestra...Score!|first=Joshua|last=Ostroff|work=Exclaim.ca|date=June 2002|access-date=10 August 2013}}</ref>

The band were asked by the organisers of the [[Porto]] European City of Culture 2001 festival to write a new [[film score|score]] to [[Dziga Vertov]]'s classic 1929 [[Soviet Union]] film ''[[Man with a Movie Camera]],'' to be performed live in accompaniment with a showing of the [[silent film]].<ref name="empireonline">{{cite web|first1=PHIL DE|last1=SEMLYEN|access-date=2019-04-09|title=Alternative Silent Film Scores To Knock Your Socks Off|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/alternative-silent-scores/|date=10 August 2012|website=Empire}}</ref> The work differed from the band's usual compositions due to its live performance, ruling out the post production work that was present on ''Motion.'' The Cinematic Orchestra toured the work and later released it as an album.<ref name="empireonline"/><ref>{{cite news|first1=Peter|last1=Bradshaw|access-date=2019-04-09|title=Man With a Movie Camera review – visionary, transformative 1929 experimental film|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/30/man-with-a-movie-camera-review|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 July 2015|issn=0261-3077|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> Many of the compositions originally created for that album, ''[[Man with a Movie Camera (The Cinematic Orchestra album)|Man with a Movie Camera]],'' were later adapted from live form (adding in vocal tracks and electronic elements, among other changes) for their next album, ''[[Every Day (album)|Every Day]]''. It reached #54 in the [[UK Albums Chart]] in May 2002.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book|first=David|last=Roberts|year=2006|title=[[British Hit Singles & Albums]]|edition=19th|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|location=London|isbn=1-904994-10-5|page=107}}</ref>

In 2006, The Cinematic Orchestra created a cover version of [[Radiohead]]'s "[[Exit Music (For a Film)]]" that appeared on an album titled ''[[Exit Music: Songs with Radio Heads]].''<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2019-04-09|title=Various Artists: Exit Music: Songs With Radio Heads|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6663-exit-music-songs-with-radio-heads/|website=Pitchfork}}</ref> In this piece the band slowed down the tempo of the original, divided the timbre into four sections beginning with saxophone, to the classical guitar, to the electric guitar, ending the piece with the same simple acoustic guitar rhythm as the original.

The Cinematic Orchestra released the album ''[[Ma Fleur]]'' in May 2007.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2019-04-09|title=The Cinematic Orchestra: Ma Fleur|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10334-ma-fleur/|website=Pitchfork}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first1=Pascal|last1=Wyse|access-date=2019-04-09|title=He shoots, he scores|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/may/11/electronicmusic|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 May 2007|issn=0261-3077|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first1=Stuart|last1=Nicholson|access-date=2019-04-09|title=CD: Cinematic Orchestra, Ma Fleur|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/apr/22/jazz.shopping|newspaper=The Observer|date=21 April 2007|issn=0029-7712|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first1=Robert|last1=Jackman|access-date=2019-04-09|title=BBC - Music - Review of Cinematic Orchestra - Ma Fleur|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/fpzf/|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Several songs feature [[Patrick Watson (musician)|Patrick Watson]], [[Fontella Bass]], or [[Lou Rhodes]] on vocals, with Rhodes and Watson sharing vocals on one song.

The Cinematic Orchestra recorded the soundtrack to the [[Disneynature]] film ''[[The Crimson Wing: Mystery of the Flamingos]],''<ref>{{cite web|first1=Jordan|last1=Mintzer|access-date=2019-04-09|title=The Crimson Wing: Mystery of the Flamingos|url=https://variety.com/2009/film/reviews/the-crimson-wing-mystery-of-the-flamingos-1200473080/|date=26 January 2009}}</ref> released in France in December 2008 (originally as ''Les ailes pourpres: Le mystère des flamants).''
