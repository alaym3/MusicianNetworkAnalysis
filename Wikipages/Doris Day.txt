'''Doris Day''' (born '''Doris Mary Anne Kappelhoff'''; April 3, 1922&nbsp;– May 13, 2019<!-- Do not change her birth date to 1924 or any other date - this has been discussed and resolved on the talk page. -->) was an American actress, singer, and animal welfare activist. She began her career as a [[big band]] singer in 1939, achieving commercial success in 1945 with two No. 1 recordings, "[[Sentimental Journey (song)|Sentimental Journey]]" and "[[My Dreams Are Getting Better All the Time]]" with [[Les Brown & His Band of Renown]]. She left Brown to embark on a solo career and recorded more than 650 songs from 1947 to 1967.

Day was one of the biggest film stars in the 1950s–1960s era.  Day's film career began during the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]] with the film ''[[Romance on the High Seas]]'' (1948). She starred in films of many genres, including musicals, comedies, dramas, and thrillers. She played the title role in ''[[Calamity Jane (film)|Calamity Jane]]'' (1953) and starred in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1956) with [[James Stewart]]. Her best-known films are those in which she co-starred with [[Rock Hudson]], chief among them 1959's ''[[Pillow Talk (film)|Pillow Talk]]'', for which she was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She also worked with [[James Garner]] on both ''[[Move Over, Darling]]'' (1963) and ''[[The Thrill of It All (film)|The Thrill of It All]]'' (1963), and  starred alongside [[Clark Gable]], [[Cary Grant]], [[James Cagney]], [[David Niven]], [[Ginger Rogers]], [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Lauren Bacall]], and [[Rod Taylor]] in various movies. After ending her film career in 1968, only briefly removed from the height of her popularity, she starred in her own sitcom ''[[The Doris Day Show]]'' (1968–1973).

In 1989, she was awarded the [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] [[Cecil B. DeMille Award]] for lifetime achievement in motion pictures. In 2004, she was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]]. In 2008, she received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award as well as a Legend Award from the [[Society of Singers]]. In 2011, she was awarded the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association's Career Achievement Award]]. The same year, she released her 29th studio album, ''[[My Heart (Doris Day album)|My Heart]]'', which contained new material and became a UK Top 10 album. {{As of|2020}}, she was one of eight record performers to have been the top box-office earner in the United States four times.<ref>{{cite web|date=2013|title=Doris Day|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/BiographiesDetailsPage/BiographiesDetailsWindow?failOverType=&query=&prodId=BIC1&windowstate=normal&contentModules=&display-query=&mode=view&displayGroupName=Biographies&limiter=&currPage=&disableHighlighting=false&displayGroups=&sortBy=&search_within_results=&p=BIC1&action=e&catId=&activityType=&scanId=&documentId=GALE%7CK2419200293&u=xavier_main&jsid=9460d7cd6fd7bee022fae21120e7eb84|access-date=January 15, 2016|website=Biography in Context|publisher=Gale|location=Detroit, MI}}</ref><ref name="AEHotchner1976">{{Cite book|last=Hotchner|first=A.E.|title=Doris Day: Her Own Story|publisher=William Morrow and Company, Inc.|year=1976|isbn=978-0-688-02968-5|location=New York}}</ref>

===Early career (1938–1947)===
[[File:Doris Day, Aquarium, gottlieb.01841.jpg|thumb|upright|Day at the Aquarium Jazz Club, New York (1946)]]
While recovering from her car accident, Kappelhoff started to sing along with the radio and discovered a talent she did not know she had. "During this long, boring period, I used to while away a lot of time listening to the radio, sometimes singing along with the likes of [[Benny Goodman]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], and [[Glenn Miller]]", she told [[A. E. Hotchner]], one of Day's biographers. "But the one radio voice I listened to above others belonged to [[Ella Fitzgerald]]. There was a quality to her voice that fascinated me, and I'd sing along with her, trying to catch the subtle ways she shaded her voice, the casual yet clean way she sang the words."

Observing her daughter sing rekindled Alma's interest in [[show business]], and she decided Doris must have singing lessons. She engaged a teacher, Grace Raine.{{Sfn|Hotchner|1975|p=38}} After three lessons, Raine told Alma that young Doris had "tremendous potential"; Raine was so impressed that she gave Doris three lessons a week for the price of one. Years later, Day said that Raine had the biggest effect on her singing style and career.{{Sfn|Hotchner|1975|pp=38–39}}

During the eight months she was taking singing lessons, Kappelhoff had her first professional jobs as a vocalist, on the [[WLW]] radio program ''Carlin's Carnival'', and in a local restaurant, Charlie Yee's Shanghai Inn.{{Sfn|Hotchner|1975|pp=40–41}} During her radio performances, she first caught the attention of [[Barney Rapp]], who was looking for a female vocalist and asked if she would like to audition for the job. According to Rapp, he had auditioned about 200 singers when Kappelhoff got the job.{{Sfn|Hotchner|1975|p=44}}

While working for Rapp in 1939, she adopted the stage surname "Day", at Rapp's suggestion.<ref>{{cite news|title=Doris Day's sweet success| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3569113.stm|work=[[BBC News]] |access-date= August 10, 2013|date=April 3, 2004}}</ref> Rapp felt that "Kappelhoff" was too long for [[Marquee (sign)|marquees]], and he admired her rendition of the song "Day After Day".{{Sfn|Kaufman|2008|p=22}} After working with Rapp, Day worked with bandleaders Jimmy James,<ref>{{cite news|title=To Entertain at Convention Here |url= https://newspaperarchive.com/anonymous-celebrity-clipping-apr-17-1940-241851| access-date=April 3, 2017|work=[[The Lima News]]|date=April 17, 1940|page=11}} {{free access}}</ref> [[Bob Crosby]],<ref name="Sutro2011">{{cite book| last= Sutro| first=Dirk|title=Jazz For Dummies| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tqkRibY3RHoC&pg=PA112|access-date=August 8, 2013|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-06852-6|page=112}}</ref> and [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]].<ref name="Family2009">{{cite book|author=The Guinan Family |title= Lakewood Park |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zh0zVcyDFxUC&pg=PA72 |access-date= August 8, 2013|date=October 2009| publisher= Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-6578-1|page=72}}</ref> In 1941, Day appeared as a singer in three [[Soundies]] with the Les Brown band.<ref name="TerenzioMacGillivray1991">{{cite book|last1=Terenzio|first1=Maurice|last2=MacGillivray|first2=Scott|last3=Okuda|first3=Ted|title=The Soundies Distributing Corporation of America: a history and filmography of their "jukebox" musical films of the 1940s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aH5ZAAAAMAAJ|access-date=August 9, 2013|date=1991|publisher=McFarland & Co.|isbn=978-0-89950-578-7|pages=33–35}}</ref>

In a rare interview with ''The Hollywood Reporter'' on April 4, 2019, the day after her 97th birthday, Day talked about her work on the Doris Day Animal Foundation, founded in 1978. On the question of what her favorite film was, she answered ''[[Calamity Jane (film)|Calamity Jane]]'': "I was such a tomboy growing up, and she was such a fun character to play. Of course, the music was wonderful, too—'Secret Love,' especially, is such a beautiful song."<ref name="HR2019">Laurie Brookins, [https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/doris-day-talks-turning-97-her-animal-philanthropy-rock-hudson-1199279 “Doris Day, in Rare Interview, Talks Turning 97, Her Animal Foundation and Rock Hudson: 'I Miss Him'”], ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''. April 3, 2019. ''(Retrieved April 10, 2019.)''</ref>

To commemorate her birthday, her fans gathered each year to take part in a three-day party in her hometown of [[Carmel, California]], in late March. The event was also a fundraiser for her Animal Foundation. During the 2019 event, there was a special screening of her film ''[[Pillow Talk (film)|Pillow Talk]]'' (1959) to celebrate its 60th anniversary. About the film, Day stated in the same interview that she "had such fun working with my pal, Rock. We laughed our way through three films we made together and remained great friends. I miss him."<ref name="HR2019" />

==Animal welfare activism==
Day's interest in animal welfare and related issues apparently dated to her teen years. While recovering from an automobile accident, she took her dog Tiny for a walk without a leash. Tiny ran into the street and was killed by a passing car. Day later expressed guilt and loneliness about Tiny's untimely death. 

It was during the making of ''The Man Who Knew Too Much'', when she saw how camels, goats, and other "animal extras" in a marketplace scene were being treated, that Day began actively preventing animal abuse. She was so appalled at the conditions the animals used in filming were kept in that she refused to work unless they were properly fed and cared for. The production company had to set up "feeding stations" for the various goats, sheep, camels, etc., and feed them every day before Day would agree to go back to work. 

In 1971, she co-founded Actors and Others for Animals, and appeared in a series of newspaper advertisements denouncing the wearing of fur, alongside [[Mary Tyler Moore]], [[Angie Dickinson]], and [[Jayne Meadows]].{{Sfn|Patrick|McGee|2006|p=132|ps=, photograph of ad.}}

In 1978, Day founded the Doris Day Pet Foundation, now the Doris Day Animal Foundation (DDAF).<ref name="Grudens2001">{{cite book|last=Grudens|first=Richard|title=Sally Bennett's Magic Moments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R6M6S4t4ejcC&pg=PA115|access-date=August 8, 2013|year=2001|publisher=Celebrity Profiles Publishing|isbn=978-1-57579-181-4|page=115}}</ref> A non-profit [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)(3) grant-giving public charity]], DDAF funds other non-profit causes throughout the US that share DDAF's mission of helping animals and the people who love them.
