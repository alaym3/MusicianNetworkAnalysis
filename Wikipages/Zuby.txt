==Police incident==

| quote = It took me a couple of seconds to realise that it was me that all those guns were aimed at. I honestly felt like I'd stepped off the train and into a really bad dream. I'm shocked, confused, scared and embarrassed all at the same time. Most of the bystanders had vacated the platform by now, by police order. And I'm not talking about normal police either. This is the Specialist Firearms Unit, about eight of them, machine guns, bulletproof vests, police dogs and all. And they're here to arrest me!

On 5 July 2008,<ref name="Lewis 2008b" /> at 3:49&nbsp;pm, a man displayed an [[imitation firearm]] at an indoor shopping centre in [[Basingstoke]]; afterwards [[Hampshire Constabulary]] distributed a description of him.<ref name="Lewis 2008d" /> At 5:24&nbsp;pm the same day, Udezue boarded a train from Southampton to Bournemouth, which is about {{Convert|30|miles|km|abbr=out}} from Basingstoke.<ref name="Lewis 2008a" /><ref name="Lewis 2008b" /> Shortly thereafter, [[British Transport Police]] (BTP), after being notified by Hampshire Police,<ref name="BBC News 2008" /> believed Udezue may have been involved in the Basingstoke incident.<ref name="Lewis 2008d" /> Throughout this time, miscommunication about the colour of Udezue's T-shirt occurred; the BTP initially described his shirt as "brown" but it was later described as "dark".<ref name="Lewis 2008e" /> About ten officers then blocked off the exits as the train approached [[Bournemouth railway station]].<ref name="Lewis 2008a" /><ref name="Lewis 2008b" /><ref name="Lewis 2008c" /> The train arrived at 6:09&nbsp;pm and Udezue was arrested at gunpoint and was forced to lie prone and was handcuffed, by [[Dorset Police]].<ref name="BBC News 2008" /><ref name="Lewis 2008d" /> Udezue was briefly detained at Bournemouth police station before being released.<ref name="BBC News 2008" /> Dorset Police later issued an apology for the arrest.<ref name="BBC News 2008" /> He was arrested because he was a [[Black people|black man]] wearing a black t-shirt,<ref name="EW 2008" /><ref name="Lewis 2008a" /><ref name="Lewis 2008b" /><ref name="Lewis 2008c" /> which matched the description of the actual suspect. Udezue quipped: "And to think I was going to wear a blue T-shirt this morning".<ref name="BBC News 2008" /><ref name="Edwards 2008" /> Udezue, who had no criminal record,<ref name="Lewis 2008a" /><ref name="EW 2008" /><ref name="Lewis 2008c" /> later described the incident as a "really bad dream" and said he had "never been so traumatised" in his life.<ref name="BBC News 2008" />

Rather than conducting a full investigation themselves, the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] (IPCC) asked Dorset Police's Professional Standards Department to investigate the three forces involved.<ref name="BBC News 2008" /><ref name="Lewis 2008e" /> In a statement, the IPCC said the actions of Dorset Police were "appropriate and proportionate to the circumstances".<ref name="Lewis 2008a" /> On 14 July, Udezue's solicitor filed an official complaint to the IPCC over the incident and requested a full and independent investigation into the incident.<ref name="Lewis 2008e" />

A few days after the incident, Udezue's social media accounts received many supportive messages from the public.<ref name="Lewis 2008a" /><ref name="Lewis 2008b" /><ref name="Lewis 2008c" /> Udezue's local [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] [[Tobias Ellwood]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] stated he backed the actions of the police, saying they do a "very difficult job"<ref name="Lewis 2008c" /> and that it is important "police don't fear stepping in for fear of reprisals if they get the wrong person".<ref name="Lewis 2008c" /> The arrest was compared to the [[shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes]].<ref name="Edwards 2008" /><ref name="Lewis 2008a" /><ref name="Lewis 2008b" /><ref name="Lewis 2008c" /><ref name="Lewis 2008e" /> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'s}} Simon Vozick-Levinson described the incident as "something of a [[cause célèbre]]".<ref name="EW 2008" /> ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'s}} Paul Lewis and Vozick-Levinson said the incident may be an example of [[racial profiling]].<ref name="EW 2008" /><ref name="Lewis 2008d" /> Udezue, who is of [[Nigerians|Nigerian heritage]], thought his race was not pivotal to the incident but should still be considered a part of any investigation.<ref name="Lewis 2008e" />

==Views==
In response to a music festival that charged white people double the price it charged people of other ethnicities, Udezue commented: "Well done intersectional radicals. You've become the very racists you claim to stand against."<ref name="WaPo 2019" /><ref name="CTV News 2019" />

===Transgender people===
In March 2019, Udezue received worldwide attention after posting on Twitter a video of himself performing a [[deadlift]] of {{convert|238|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and subsequently stating he had broken the British women's deadlift record while "identifying as a woman".<ref name="WQAD" /><ref name="Urwin 2019" /><ref name="Myers 2019" /><ref name="Sky News 2019" /> Shortly after, he made similar comments about the British women's [[bench press]] record.<ref name="Urwin 2019" /><ref name="WQAD" /> The tweets added to the ongoing debate about [[transgender people in sports]].<ref name="Urwin 2019" /><ref name="Sky News 2019" /> Udezue has said he does not think [[trans women]] should be allowed to compete in women's sport.<ref name="Sky News 2019" /> Udezue went on to say he posted the tweets to demonstrate the "fallacies of the arguments on the other side" and commented: "I have seen people saying there is no inherent biological strength difference between men and women. I posted it being a bit tongue-in-cheek, showing what I think is the obvious absurdity of their argument."<ref name="Urwin 2019" /> After he expressed these views, Rosamund Urwin of ''[[The Times]]'' described Udezue as an "unlikely feminist icon".<ref name="Urwin 2019" />

In February 2020, after Udezue posted a tweet advising women on "how to land a great guy", transgender activist [[Emily Gorcenski]], who is a [[trans woman]], replied: "I'm like 95% sure I'm sleeping with more women than you and this is terrible advice".<ref name="Neale 2020" /> Udezue responded with "Ok dude...", which resulted in his Twitter account being suspended for "hateful conduct".<ref name="Neale 2020" /> After his manual review was denied, he deleted the tweet and his account was restored.<ref name="Delete tweet" />

In September 2020, Udezue, together with other notable figures, signed a letter in support of author [[J. K. Rowling]]'s [[Politics of J. K. Rowling#Transgender people|views on transgender people]].<ref name="O'Connor 2020" />

==Personal life==

So we lived in Saudi Arabia and I went to school there up until fifth grade so when I was 11 I went boarding school at the age of 11. So I was back and forth between the two countries for a long time did really well in school got into Oxford university and went there to study computer science so I did that for three years. When I was in my first year I started rapping. When I was a kid I used to play piano so I did some music in the past then I also played trombona in a band for a while and then I kind of fell out of love with music and fell back into it. I was a hip-hop fan in my teen years at school I started rapping in university and discovered I had a knack for writing lyrics and performing so I released my first album Commercial Underground when I was 19 and put that out independently sold a few thousand copies and that kind of set the spark of oh this maybe something I can do something with. So I graduated moved to London I worked as a management consultant actually for a couple of years while juggling my music stuff on the side and then in November 2011 I took the plunge and said hey I'm gonna go pursue my music stuff full-time and I haven't starved to death yet so I'm doing something right and then other things have been added to the mix.}}</ref>
