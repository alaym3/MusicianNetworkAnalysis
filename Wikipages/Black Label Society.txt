'''Black Label Society''' is an American [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band formed in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]] in 1998 by guitarist/singer [[Zakk Wylde]]. To date, the band has released eleven studio albums, two live albums, two compilation albums, one [[Extended play|EP]], and three video albums.

==History==
===''Sonic Brew'' and Formation (1998–1999)===
In the early 1990s, Wylde had formed his own solo band [[Pride & Glory (band)|Pride & Glory]], playing a mixture of [[Blues|bluesy]] [[Southern rock]] with heavy metal.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} However, they disbanded in December 1994 after having released only one album. Wylde subsequently recorded an acoustic solo album, ''[[Book of Shadows (album)|Book of Shadows]]'' (1996). In May 1998, after limited commercial success with ''Book of Shadows'', Wylde and drummer [[Phil Ondich]] recorded what became Black Label Society's debut album ''[[Sonic Brew]]''. It was decided, rather than the album being another solo album for Wylde, that they would form a long term band. It was known from the start that [[Nick Catanese]] would be retained as the second guitarist in the band (Catanese previously toured as rhythm guitarist for the Book of Shadows tour). [[John DeServio]], who previously worked with Wylde as a temporary replacement in Pride & Glory, joined as the band's bassist for the album's tour.

''Sonic Brew'' was released in Japan on October 28, 1998. Due to delays in signing with a record label ([[Spitfire Records]]), the album was not released in the rest of the world until May 4, 1999.

===Line-up changes and subsequent releases (1999–2007)===
The band's second album ''[[Stronger Than Death]]'' followed in 2000, with DeServio being replaced by [[Steve Gibb]]. [[Craig Nunenmacher]] replaced Ondich in July 2000, with his debut recording with the band being the live album ''[[Alcohol Fueled Brewtality|Alcohol Fueled Brewtality Live +5]]''. This was followed by ''[[1919 Eternal]]'', which was dedicated to Wylde's father and was released in 2002. Steve Gibb was temporarily replaced by [[Mike Inez]] (Alice In Chains) during the [[Ozzfest]] 2001 tour, and then [[Robert Trujillo]] took over bass duties for the band the next year.

In 2003, Trujillo joined [[Metallica]], leaving the bass position in Black Label Society open, which left room for Inez to rejoin the band for a short two-week tour, supporting the band's album ''[[The Blessed Hellride]]''. [[James LoMenzo]] joined the band in 2004 after the release of ''[[Hangover Music Vol. VI]]'', which was the band's last release for [[Spitfire Records]].

On the first four studio albums, Wylde played every instrument, except for the drums, including vocals, guitars, piano, and bass guitar.

In 2005, after the band signed with [[Artemis Records]], the album ''[[Mafia (Black Label Society album)|Mafia]]'' was released. In October, LoMenzo left the band (and joined [[Megadeth]] a few months later) and was replaced by the band's original bassist, John DeServio. In 2006, the band left Artemis Records and signed to Roadrunner Records, releasing the album ''[[Shot to Hell]]''.

In June 2007, Black Label Society parted ways with [[Roadrunner Records]].

===Side bands and lineup changes (2007–present)===

In July 2007, band members DeServio and Catanese both signaled the start of new bands as Zakk Wylde toured with [[Ozzy Osbourne]]. Drummer Craig Nunenmacher left the band in February 2010, and was replaced by Will Hunt (of [[Dark New Day]], [[Evanescence]]). Hunt’s first live performance with the band would be on July 24, 2010, at the first edition of the [[High Voltage Festival]] in London.  

On August 10, 2010, ''[[Order of the Black]]'', their eighth studio album, was released. It reached number 4 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart.<ref name="Music Legends">{{cite web |publisher=Music Legends| url=http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/zakk-wylde-interview/| title=Zakk Wylde Interview| access-date=May 8, 2013|date=September 22, 2010|last=Saulnier|first=Jason}}</ref>

In 2011 the band toured in support of their new album. The Black Label Berzerkus tour started in Portland, Oregon, with [[Children of Bodom]] and [[Clutch (band)|Clutch]] sharing the main support slot and [[2Cents|2cents]] opening.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3i7acb6b7c0df1eb708af933cff999d2af |title=Zakk Wylde Launching Black Label Berzerkus Tour This Fall |website=Billboard.biz |date=2010-06-16 |access-date=2011-07-06 |archive-date=August 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822095934/http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3i7acb6b7c0df1eb708af933cff999d2af |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In March 2011, Will Hunt left the band to record with Evanescence, and [[Danzig_(band)|Danzig]] drummer [[Johnny Kelly]] (formerly of [[Type O Negative]]) filled in for him for the rest of the tour, however in May 2011, Mike Froedge of [[doubleDrive]] and Catanese's band Speed X joined the band.

Black Label Society released the compilation album ''[[The Song Remains Not the Same]]'' on May 3, 2011, via [[MNRK Music Group|Entertainment One Music]]. The offering features unplugged versions of material from the album ''[[Order of the Black]]'', as well as additional material recorded during the ''Order of the Black'' sessions. ''The Song Remains Not the Same'' was conceived, created and compiled by Zakk Wylde and the title is a nod to one of Wylde's favorite bands, Led Zeppelin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=155168 |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET - BLACK LABEL SOCIETY To Release 'The Song Remains Not The Same' In May |website=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=2011-07-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518072850/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=155168 |archive-date=2011-05-18 }}</ref>
