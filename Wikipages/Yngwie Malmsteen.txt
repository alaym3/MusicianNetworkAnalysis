'''Yngwie Johan Malmsteen''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʌ|ŋ|w|eɪ|_|ˈ|m|ɑː|l|m|s|t|iː|n}}; born '''Lars Johan Yngve Lannerbäck''', 30 June 1963) is a Swedish guitarist, songwriter, composer, and [[bandleader]]. Malmsteen first became known in the 1980s for his [[neoclassical metal|neoclassical]] playing style in [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and has released 22 studio albums in a career spanning over 40 years. In 2009, [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] rated Malmsteen as number 9 among the 11 greatest [[electric guitar]] players of all time.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tyrangiel|first1=Josh|title=The 10 Greatest Electric-Guitar Players of All Time|url=http://time.com/3961025/10-greatest-guitar-players/|website=Time.com|access-date=7 January 2017}}</ref>

==Early life==
Malmsteen was born Lars Johan Yngve Lannerbäck in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, the third child of a musical family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://megarockradio.net/2018/06/30/swedish-guitarist-yngwie-malmsteen-turns-55-years-old-today-steve-huey-of-allmu/|title=Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen turns 55 years old today.

At the age of twelve he took his mother's maiden name Malmsten as his surname, then slightly changed it to Malmsteen and altered his third given name Yngve to "Yngwie".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://guitarconnoisseurmagazine.com/wordpress1/2016/05/20/yngwie-j-malmsteen-a-force-to-be-reckoned-with/|title=Yngwie J.

Malmsteen has stated that [[Jimi Hendrix]] had no musical impact on him and did not contribute to his style. However watching the TV news reports on 18 September 1970 of Hendrix's death, which included footage of Hendrix smashing and burning his guitar at the Monterey Pop Festival of 1967, made Malmsteen think, "This is really cool."<ref name="Yngwie Malmsteen - Rockthology#2">[https://web.archive.org/web/20131206152728/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQAU_-gPnUU] </ref>

==Career==
=== 1980s ===
In early 1982, [[Mike Varney]] of [[Shrapnel Records]], who had heard a demo tape of Malmsteen's playing from the 1978 demo titled Powerhouse, brought Malmsteen to the United States.<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|page=1595}}</ref> He played briefly with the band [[Steeler (American band)|Steeler]] on its 1983 self-titled album.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>  He then appeared with [[Graham Bonnet]] in the band [[Alcatrazz]], playing on its 1983 debut ''[[No Parole from Rock 'n' Roll]]'' and the 1984 live album ''[[Live Sentence]]''.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Bonnet and Malmsteen clashed about who was the frontman and had a fight during a show.<ref name="Malmsteen out of Alcatrazz due to clash with Graham Bonnet">[https://youtube.com/hoP28gYS8JE] {{dead link|date=July 2021}}</ref> Malmsteen was fired on the spot from Alcatrazz and replaced by [[Steve Vai]]. Vai had one day to learn the songs for the ongoing tour.<ref name="Malmsteen out of Alcatrazz - Vai hired to finish tour">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vai.com/bands/|title=The Official Steve Vai Website|website=Vai.com|access-date=19 July 2021}}</ref> In 1984, Malmsteen released his first solo album ''[[Rising Force]]'', which featured [[Barriemore Barlow|Barrie Barlow]] of [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] on drums and keyboard player [[Jens Johansson]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/> His album was meant to be an instrumental side-project of Alcatrazz, but it ended up featuring vocals by [[Jeff Scott Soto]] and Malmsteen left Alcatrazz soon after the release of ''Rising Force''.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

''Rising Force'' won the ''[[Guitar Player]]'''s award for Best Rock Album and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for 'Best Rock Instrumental', reaching no. 60 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' album chart. Yngwie J. Malmsteen's Rising Force (as his band was thereafter known) next released ''[[Marching Out]]'' (1985).<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Then he recruited Jens Johansson's brother [[Anders Johansson (drummer)|Anders]] to play drums and bassist [[Marcel Jacob]] to record and tour with the band.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Jacob left in the middle of a tour and was replaced by [[Wally Voss]]. Malmsteen's third album, ''[[Trilogy (Yngwie J. Malmsteen album)|Trilogy]]'', featuring the vocals of [[Mark Boals]] (and Malmsteen on both guitar and bass), was released in 1986.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Boals left the band in the middle of the tour and was replaced by the former singer Jeff Scott Soto.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> The tour was cancelled after Malmsteen had involved in a serious car accident,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> smashing his V12 [[Jaguar E-Type]] into a tree, which put him in a coma for a week. Nerve damage to his right hand was reported. During this time, Malmsteen's mother died from cancer. New line-up changes for the next album with former [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]] vocalist [[Joe Lynn Turner]] joined the band,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> along with session bassist [[Bob Daisley]], who was hired to record some bass parts and help with the lyrics. In April 1988, he released his fourth album ''[[Odyssey (Yngwie Malmsteen album)|Odyssey]]''.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> ''Odyssey'' was his most successful album, in part due to the success of its first single "Heaven Tonight". Shows in the [[Soviet Union]] during the Odyssey tour were recorded and released in 1989 as a fifth album ''[[Trial by Fire: Live in Leningrad]]''.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> The classic Rising Force line-up with Malmsteen and the Johansson brothers was dissolved in 1989 when both Anders and Jens left. That year later, Jens joined [[Dio (band)|Dio]] replacing keyboardist Claude Schnell.

Malmsteen's [[neoclassical metal|neoclassical]] style of metal became popular among hordes of guitarists during the mid-1980s, with contemporaries such as [[Jason Becker]], [[Paul Gilbert]], [[Tony MacAlpine]], and [[Vinnie Moore]] becoming prominent.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}} In late 1988, Malmsteen's signature [[Fender Stratocaster]] guitar was released, making him and [[Eric Clapton]] the first artists to be honored by [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]].

=== 1990s ===
In the early 1990s, Malmsteen released two albums, ''[[Eclipse (Yngwie Malmsteen album)|Eclipse]]'' (1990)<ref name="LarkinGE"/> and ''[[Fire & Ice (Yngwie Malmsteen album)|Fire & Ice]]'' (1992), with the singer Göran Edman, followed by ''[[The Seventh Sign (album)|The Seventh Sign]]'' (1994) and ''[[Magnum Opus (Yngwie Malmsteen album)|Magnum Opus]]'' (1995) with former Loudness singer Mike Vescera. Despite his early and continuous success in Europe and Asia, by the early 1990s heavy metal styles, such as neoclassical metal and [[Shred guitar|shredding]] had gone out of fashion in the US.

Around 1993, Malmsteen's future mother-in-law – who opposed his engagement to her daughter – had him arrested for allegedly holding her daughter hostage with a gun. The charges were later dropped.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.guitarsite.com/Yngwie.htm|title=Yngwie Malmsteen|website=Guitarsite.com}}</ref> Malmsteen continued to record and release albums under the Japanese record label [[Pony Canyon]] and maintained a devoted following with fans in Europe and Japan and to a lesser extent in the US.

In the mid 1990s, Malmsteen released the albums ''[[Inspiration (Yngwie Malmsteen album)|Inspiration]]'' (1996) featuring three of his former singers Soto, Boals and Turner, ''[[Facing the Animal]]'' (1997) featuring Mats Levèn on vocals and Cozy Powell on drums, followed by a live record ''[[Double Live!]]'' (1998) and another studio recording ''[[Alchemy (Yngwie Malmsteen album)|Alchemy]]'' (1999) featuring once again Mark Boals on vocals.

===Special guest appearances and side projects===
In 1996, Malmsteen joined forces with former band members [[Jeff Scott Soto]] and [[Marcel Jacob]] on the "Human Clay" album where he played lead guitar on the track "Jealousy". In the same year, Yngwie recorded guitar solos for two different Deep Purple tribute albums, "Smoke on the Water" and "Black Night - Deep Purple Tribute According to New York" on the last one using the alias "Lars Y. Loudamp" to avoid contractual conflicts. He also guested with [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]] on the song Denim And Leather on their live album ''[[The Eagle Has Landed – Part II]]'' (released in 1997). Later that year, Yngwie recorded the tracks "Enigma suite" and "All opposable thumbs" with his former band members [[Jens Johansson]] and [[Anders Johansson (drummer)|Anders Johansson]] on their album ''Johansson/Sonic Winter''.

===2000s===
[[File:Yngwie barcelona.jpg|thumb|right|Malmsteen in Barcelona, 2009]]
In 2000, he signed a contract with the US record label Spitfire and released his 1990s catalog on the US market for the first time, including what he regards as his masterpiece, ''[[Concerto Suite for Electric Guitar and Orchestra]]'', recorded with the [[Czech Philharmonic]] in Prague.

After the release of ''[[War to End All Wars (album)|War to End All Wars]]'' in 2000, singer [[Mark Boals]] left the band. He was replaced by former [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]] vocalist [[Doogie White]], whose vocals were well received by fans. In 2003, Malmsteen joined [[Joe Satriani]] and [[Steve Vai]] as part of the [[G3 (tour)|G3]] [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]], a tour showcasing guitar performances. Malmsteen made two guest appearances on keyboardist [[Derek Sherinian]]'s albums ''[[Black Utopia]]'' (2003), and ''[[Blood of the Snake]]'' (2006) where Malmsteen plays on the same tracks as [[Al Di Meola]] and [[Zakk Wylde]]. In 2004, Malmsteen made two cameo appearances on [[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]. In 2005 ''[[Unleash the Fury]]'' was released through Spitfire Records. As stated in an issue of "Guitar World" magazine, he titled this album after an infamous 'airline incident', which occurred on a flight to Japan during a 1988 tour. He was drunk and behaving obnoxiously, until he fell asleep and was roused by a woman pouring a jug of iced water on him. Enraged, he shouted, "You've released the fucking fury!" The audio from this incident was caught on tape by a fellow band member.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topic/Unleash_the_Fury |title=Literature Study Guides - By Popularity |publisher=eNotes.com |access-date=2014-07-28}}</ref> Malmsteen says that the name of the album refers to both the energy of the album and the incident. The release of ''Unleash the Fury'' was followed by a DVD release of ''Concerto Suite For Electric Guitar And Orchestra in E Flat Minor, Op. 1 – With The New Japan Philharmonic Live''. The DVD chronicles Malmsteen's first time playing in front of a live audience with an orchestra, an experience that he describes as "fun but also extremely scary".

In 2007, Malmsteen was honored in the [[Xbox 360]] version of ''[[Guitar Hero II]]''. Players can receive the "Yngwie Malmsteen" award by hitting 1000 or more notes in succession.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trueachievements.com/a15525/yngwie-malmsteen-award-achievement.htm |title=Yngwie Malmsteen Award Achievement in Guitar Hero II |publisher=Trueachievements.com |access-date=2014-07-28}}</ref> February 2008 saw the replacement of singer Doogie White with former [[Iced Earth]] and [[Judas Priest]] and current [[Beyond Fear]] singer [[Tim "Ripper" Owens]], with whom Malmsteen had once recorded a cover of [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s song "[[Mr Crowley|Mr. Crowley]]", for the 2000 Osbourne [[tribute album]] ''Bat Head Soup: A Tribute to Ozzy''. The first Malmsteen album to feature Owens is titled ''[[Perpetual Flame]]'' and was released on 4 October. On 25 November 2008, Malmsteen had three of his songs ("Caprici Di Diablo", "Damnation Game", and "Red Devil", all from this latter album) released as downloadable content for the video games ''Rock Band [[Rock Band 2]] and later [[Rock Band 3]]''.

In 2008, Malmsteen was a special guest on the VH1 Classic show "That Metal Show". On 10 March 2009, Malmsteen's label Rising Force released ''[[Angels of Love]]'', an all-instrumental album, which featured acoustic arrangements of some of his best-known ballads. In August 2009, ''Time'' magazine named Malmsteen No. 9 on its list of the 10 best electric guitar players of all-time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fretbase.com/blog/2009/08/time-magazine-picks-the-10-best-electric-guitar-players-including-yngwie/ |title=Time Magazine Picks the 10 Best Electric Guitar Players (including Yngwie) |publisher=Fretbase |date=2009-08-24 |access-date=2014-07-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110402045526/http://www.fretbase.com/blog/2009/08/time-magazine-picks-the-10-best-electric-guitar-players-including-yngwie/ |archive-date=2 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Malmsteen recently released another album compilation entitled ''[[High Impact (Yngwie Malmsteen album)|High Impact]]'' on 8 December 2009.

On 23 November 2010, ''[[Relentless (Yngwie Malmsteen album)|Relentless]]'' was released, the second album to feature [[Tim "Ripper" Owens]] on vocals. The US version featured a remake of "Arpeggios From Hell" as a bonus track. Yngwie appeared on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' on 3 February 2011 to promote his album. On 6 August 2011, Malmsteen made another appearance in the United States, playing a rendition of "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" before a game between the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] and [[Miami Marlins|Florida Marlins]] at Sun Life Stadium.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yngwie Malmsteen at Sun Life Stadium|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEqhg-qozdk| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211107/wEqhg-qozdk| archive-date=2021-11-07 | url-status=live|publisher=Youtube.com|access-date=2014-07-28}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Although rarely seen in his native country of Sweden, Malmsteen played one gig there in 2012. On 7 July, he ended the Getaway Rock Festival in [[Gävle]], which he was headlining with [[Nightwish]] and [[Manowar]]. On 5 December 2012, Malmsteen released the album ''[[Spellbound (Yngwie Malmsteen album)|Spellbound]]''. 2013 saw the release of Yngwie's official autobiography ''Relentless''.<ref>Malmsteen, Yngwie (2013).

On May 8, 2021, Yngwie Malmsteen was reported to have launched the ''Parabellum'' album and video for the "Paganini-referencing" track "Wolves At The Door". Since [[COVID-19 lockdowns|COVID-19 restrictions]] prevented touring, Malmsteen had more time to record the album, and was "clearly delighted with the results."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lewry |first1=Fraser |title=Yngwie Malmsteen launches Parabellum album and video for finger-blistering Wolves At The Door |url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/yngwie-malmsteen-launches-parabellum-album-and-video-for-finger-blistering-wolves-at-the-door |website=Loudersound.com |publisher=Future Publishing Limited Quay House |access-date=10 May 2021}}</ref>

In a 2005 issue of ''Guitar Player'' magazine, Malmsteen discussed his often-ridiculed behaviour, saying that, "I've probably made more mistakes than anybody. But I don't dwell on them. I don't expect people to understand me, because I'm pretty complex, and I think outside the box with everything I do. I've always taken the untraveled path. Obviously, people have their opinions, but I can't get too wrapped up in that, because I know what I can do and I know what kind of person I am. And I have no control over what anybody says about me. Back in Sweden, I'm 'Mr Personality' in the tabloids, but obviously I can't take that seriously. I know in my heart that if I do the absolute best I can do, maybe ten years from now people may turn around and say 'he wasn't that bad'."<ref>{{Cite document|title=Yngwie Malmsteen: Total Control|id = {{ProQuest|859515933}}}}</ref>

===Yngwie Malmsteen Signature Stratocaster===

[[File:Yngwie Malmsteen's electric guitar.jpg|180px|left|thumb|Yngwie Malmsteen Signature [[Fender Stratocaster|Stratocaster]] with rosewood fretboard]]

Malmsteen has been a longtime user of [[Fender Stratocaster]]s with [[DiMarzio]] HS3 [[single-coil pickup]]s "for playing at blistering volume with no hum or screechiness".<ref>{{cite book| last=Walser |first=Robert |title=Running With the Devil: Power, Gender, and Madness in Heavy Metal Music |publisher=Wesleyan University Press}}</ref> His most famous Stratocaster is his 1972 blonde Stratocaster, nicknamed "The Duck" because of its yellow finish and the [[Donald Duck]] stickers on the headstock. An alternative nickname for this guitar is "Play Loud" due to a sticker that Anders Johansson put on the upper horn of the guitar in Rockshire studios in 1984. Fender made 100 replica copies of this guitar and marketed it as the "Play Loud Guitar". He also has a Fender Yngwie Malmsteen Signature Stratocaster since 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shop.fender.com/en/intl/0107110841.html#start=1|title=Fender Guitars - Electric, Acoustic & Bass Guitars, Amps, Pro Audio|website=Shop.fender.com}}</ref> It comes in a Vintage White finish with a maple neck, either a maple or rosewood fretboard with [[Fingerboard#Scalloping|scalloped]] frets and, from 2010, [[Seymour Duncan]] STK-S10 YJM "Fury" Model pickups. There is also a signature YJM100 Marshall amplifier, based on the "1959" amplifier range.

Even though his signature amplifier is based on the 100 watt "1959" model, Malmsteen is most noted for preferring 50 watt "1987" model metal-faced [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] amplifiers manufactured between 1972 and 1973. His speaker cabinets are always loaded with Celestion G12T-75 speakers. Another big part of his sound is his overdrive pedal, which he uses to push the front-end of the Marshalls. Most recently he is using a Fender Yngwie Malmsteen Overdrive, which is largely based on a vintage DOD Overdrive/Preamp 250 pedal which he used for many years. DOD made a (now discontinued) signature version of the DOD-250 for Malmsteen called the YJM-308 (named after a combination of his initials and the model number of one of his favorite [[Ferrari]]'s). He has been known to use his overdrive pedals in the loop of a Boss NS-2 Noise Suppressor. For clean tones he employs the use of a Boss CE-5 Chorus Ensemble, and uses a Korg DL8000R in his rack for delays. He often has a Dunlop JH-F1 Hendrix Fuzz Face on the stage-floor, but doesn't use it. Malmsteen claims that he likes seeing the Fuzz Face because it "looks like a land-mine".

Malmsteen has stated that he prefers the Stratocaster (from the period of 1968–1972); he claims that the bigger headstock on these generates more sustain.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} Malmsteen customizes his guitars by fitting a brass nut, removing the middle string tree, scalloping the fretboard, converting the neck from 3 to 4 bolt configuration (when necessary), installing Wilkinson springs on the tremolo, and refretting the neck with Dunlop 6000 fret wire. He previously disconnected the tone controls on his guitars but since Fender initiated the use of the "no load"  potentiometer no longer does this. Malmsteen now uses his signature Seymour Duncan YJM Fury pickups. Before using the YJM's, he used [[DiMarzio]] pickups – most notably the HS3 model and the YJM (now known as HS4) model. Malmsteen would use an HS3 in the bridge and two YJMs in the middle and neck positions. The YJM/HS4 is simply a staggered magnet version of the HS3. In some early recordings, Malmsteen instead used the HS3 model in the neck and bridge positions and a disconnected stock Fender single-coil pickup in the middle.  In even earlier recordings, Malmsteen was using DiMarzio FS-1 pickups.

=== Other guitars ===
Besides Stratocasters, Malmsteen has played and appeared in ads for non-Fender guitars (like [[Aria (guitar company)|Aria Pro II]] and [[Schecter Guitar Research|Schecter]] in the early 1980s) and played non-Strat-shaped guitars (like [[Gibson Flying V]]s), early in his career. Today, for acoustic and nylon string guitars, Malmsteen uses his signature [[Ovation Guitar Company|Ovation]] YM68s.
