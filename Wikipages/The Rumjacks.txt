==History==
Formed in 2008, the Rumjacks combine a variety of musical influences, including elements of [[punk rock]] and traditional [[Celtic folk]]. They released their debut [[Extended play|EP]] ''Hung, Drawn & Portered'', which was followed by their second EP ''Sound as a Pound'' later that year.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Rumjacks - Sober & Godless|url=http://www.beat.com.au/music/rumjacks|website=beat.com.au}}</ref> The Rumjacks secured international support from [[punk rock|punk]] legends like [[U.K. Subs|U.K Subs]], [[GBH (band)|GBH]], and [[Gypsy punk]] legends [[Gogol Bordello]].{{cn|date=June 2021}}

After early lineup changes, the band maintained their lineup of lead singer Frankie McLaughlin, bass player Johnny McKelvey, drummer Anthony Matters, guitarist Gabriel Whitbourne and banjo/mandolin/bouzouki player Adam Kenny, recording three critically acclaimed albums together: ''Gangs of New Holland'' (2010), ''Sober and Godless'' (2015), and ''Sleeping Rough'' (2016), before Matters' departure after their 2016 European tour.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Rumjacks biography|url=http://www.therumjacks.com/rumjacksmedia/biography}}</ref>

The Rumjacks have also performed on European tours.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Rumjacks - Upcoming Shows|url=http://www.troubadour-music.com/upcoming-tours/the-rumjacks|publisher=Troubadour Music|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603025655/http://www.troubadour-music.com/upcoming-tours/the-rumjacks|archive-date=3 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The first European tour, in 2015, included the[[Jarocin Festival]] in [[Poland]] and [[Boomtown (festival)|Boomtown]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], and was followed by their 2016 Euro tour, where they performed at festivals like Woodstock Poland, Mighty Sounds, Punk Rock Holiday, and the [[Lowlands (festival)|Lowlands Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Rumjacks Announce Massive 2016 Europe Tour |date=23 March 2016 |url=http://www.frontview-magazine.be/en/news/the-rumjacks-announce-massive-2016-europe-tour |website=Frontview Magazine}}</ref> The Rumjacks embarked on their first US tour in March 2017, which included performances at [[San Diego]]'s Shamrocked Fest and [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]'s [[South by Southwest]] Music Festival. The band later toured across Europe in2019.

=="An Irish Pub Song"==
An international breakthrough for the band came with their 2011 single, "An Irish Pub Song", which was taken from the 2010 album ''Gangs of New Holland''. The song is an observational commentary on the fact that there are [[Irish-styled pub]]s in every part of the world, and a protest against what the band saw as a commercialization and inauthentic expression of [[Irish diaspora]] culture. The song's official music video amassed over 75 million views and counting on [[YouTube]], and was the catalyst to the group's growing success and popularity in [[Europe]] and the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=An Irish Pub song|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDTQQWSmo8s|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>{{better|reason=this link to the song does not support the statements made|date=June 2021}}

Paul McKenzie from the Real McKenzies was featured on the duet "The Foreman O’Rourke", and Mickey Rickshaw appeared on the song "Billy McKinley". The album includes a version of the Irish classic {{lang|ga|"An poc ar buile"}} (The Mad Puck Goat), which is sung in Gaelic. The album was released on 12 October 2018.
