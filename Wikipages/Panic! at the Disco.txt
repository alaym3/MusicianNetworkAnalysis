'''Panic! at the Disco''' is the solo project<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gigwise.com/features/105011/panic-at-the-disco-interview-on-solo-david-bowie-wentz-death-bachelor|title=Panic! At The Disco: 'It's a solo project, but the name means something more' Brendon Urie talks to us about freedom, Death Of A Bachelor and David Bowie|author=Drew Heatley|website=Gigwise|date=January 17, 2016}}</ref> of American musician [[Brendon Urie]]. It was originally a [[pop rock]] band from [[Las Vegas|Las Vegas, Nevada]], formed in 2004 by childhood friends Urie, [[Ryan Ross]], [[Spencer Smith (musician)|Spencer Smith]], and Brent Wilson. They recorded their first demos while they were in high school. Shortly after, the band recorded and released their debut studio album, ''[[A Fever You Can't Sweat Out]]'' (2005). Popularized by the second single, "[[I Write Sins Not Tragedies]]", the album was certified [[RIAA certification|triple platinum]] in the US. In 2006, founding bassist Brent Wilson was fired from the band during an extensive world tour and subsequently replaced by [[Jon Walker]]. The band's second album, ''[[Pretty. Odd.]]'' (2008), was preceded by the single "[[Nine in the Afternoon]]". That album marked a significant departure from the sound of the band's debut. Ross and Walker, who favored the band's new direction, departed because Urie and Smith wanted to make further changes to the band's style. Ross and Walker subsequently formed a new band, [[the Young Veins]], leaving Urie and Smith as the sole remaining members of Panic! at the Disco.

Continuing as a duo, Urie and Smith released a new single, "[[New Perspective (song)|New Perspective]]", for the movie ''[[Jennifer's Body]]'', and recruited bassist [[Dallon Weekes]] and guitarist [[Ian Crawford (musician)|Ian Crawford]] as touring musicians for live performances. Weekes was later inducted into the band's lineup as a full-time member in 2010. The band's third studio album, ''[[Vices & Virtues]]'' (2011), was recorded solely by Urie and Smith in 2010, produced by [[John Feldmann]] and [[Butch Walker]]. Crawford departed once the tour cycle for ''Vices & Virtues'' ended in 2012.

As a three-piece, Urie, Smith, and Weekes recorded and released the band's fourth studio album, ''[[Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!]]'', in 2013. Prior to the release of the album, Smith unofficially left the band due to health and drug-related issues, leaving Urie and Weekes as the remaining members. The duo recruited guitarist Kenneth Harris and drummer Dan Pawlovich as touring musicians for live performances.

In 2015, Smith officially left the band after not performing live with them since his departure in 2013. Shortly thereafter, Weekes reverted to being a touring member once again, resulting in Panic! becoming Urie's solo project. In April 2015, "[[Hallelujah (Panic! at the Disco song)|Hallelujah]]" was released as the first single from Panic! at the Disco's fifth studio album, ''[[Death of a Bachelor]]'' (2016). In December 2017, Weekes officially announced his departure from the band. In March 2018, Panic! at the Disco released "[[Say Amen (Saturday Night)]]", the lead single from its sixth studio album, ''[[Pray for the Wicked]]'' (2018), which was released in June.

=== Formation as rock band and early years (2004–2005) ===
Panic! at the Disco was formed in 2004 in the suburban area of [[Summerlin, Nevada|Summerlin]], [[Las Vegas]], by childhood friends [[Ryan Ross]], who sang and played guitar, and [[Spencer Smith (musician)|Spencer Smith]], who played drums.<ref name="auto">[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p741835|pure_url=yes}} allmusic ((( Panic at the Disco – Biography )))]</ref> They both attended [[Bishop Gorman High School]], and they began playing music together in ninth grade.<ref>{{cite news|first=Brianna|last=Santiago|url=https://m.lasvegassun.com/news/2015/jun/19/12-celebrities-you-didnt-know-graduated-las-vegas-/|title=Celebrities you didn't know graduated from Las Vegas high schools|newspaper=Las Vegas Sun|date=June 19, 2015|access-date=March 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/jun/18/panic-comes-home-play-house-blues|title=Panic! comes home to play House of Blues|work=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|date=June 18, 2011|access-date=March 23, 2018}}</ref> They invited friend Brent Wilson from nearby [[Palo Verde High School]] to join on bass, and Wilson invited classmate [[Brendon Urie]] to try out on guitar.<ref name="vegasreviewjournal" /> The quartet soon began rehearsing in Smith's grandmother's living room.<ref name="whoarepatd" /> Ross initially was the lead singer for the group, but after hearing Urie sing back-up during rehearsals, the group decided to make him the lead.<ref name="abpunkint">{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=95585| title=Panic!

The band, which aimed to sound different from the many death metal bands in Las Vegas, signed a recording contract without having performed a live show.<ref name="cred" /> Urie began working at [[Tropical Smoothie Cafe]] in Summerlin to afford rent for the band's new practice space.<ref name="ok!">{{cite news|url=http://www.okmagazine.com/2011/03/panic-at-the-disco-frontman-moves-forward/|title=Panic!

Ross and Urie sent a demo to [[Fall Out Boy]] bassist [[Pete Wentz]] via a [[LiveJournal]] account.<ref name="cred" /> Wentz, who was in Los Angeles at the time with the rest of Fall Out Boy working on the band's major-label debut, ''[[From Under the Cork Tree]]'', drove to Las Vegas to meet with the young, unsigned band.<ref name="cred">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1522957/panic-at-disco-fight-cred.jhtml| title=Panic!

"We had two songs online and people were already making assumptions on what kind of band we were and what we were going to sound like."<ref name="VMAs" />

Meanwhile, Wentz began to hype the band wherever possible: from wearing "Pete! at the Disco" T-shirts onstage to mentioning the group in interviews. Wentz gave a quick shout-out to the band during a press junket on the day before the [[2005 MTV Video Music Awards]]: "I've got a couple of bands coming out soon on Decaydance, one being this band called Panic! at the Disco," Wentz said. "Their record is going to be your next favorite record.

[[File:PanicAtTheDisco.jpg|thumb|left|In 2006, the band headlined their first tour and achieved platinum status on their debut album.]]
The band relocated to College Park, Maryland, to record its debut album from June to September 2005.<ref name="vegasreviewjournal" /> Although they only had shells of songs when they arrived, the rest of the album shaped up fast through the marathon session.<ref name="vegasreviewjournal" /> "We didn't have a day off in the five-and-a-half weeks we were there, 12 or 14 hours a day," Ross said in a 2005 interview.<ref name="vegasreviewjournal" /> "We were making things up in our heads that weren't there, and on top of the stress of trying to finish the record, we were living in a one-bedroom apartment with four people on bunk beds," recalled Ross. "Everyone got on everybody's nerves. Someone would write a new part for a song and someone else would say they didn't like it just because you ate their cereal that morning."<ref name="heraldsun">{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/music/time-to-hit-panic-button/story-e6frf9hf-1111112310242| title=Time to hit panic button|author=Cathy McCabe|date=October 5, 2006|work=Herald Sun |location=Australia|access-date=March 23, 2011}}</ref>

The album is split into two halves: the first half is mostly electronic dance punk, while the second half features Vaudevillian piano, strings, and accordion.<ref name="blink" /> The band grew tired of writing only with drum machines and keyboards and, inspired by film scores (specifically the works of [[Danny Elfman]] and [[Jon Brion]]) decided to write a completely different half.<ref name="abpunkint" /> "By the end of that, we were completely exhausted," said Ross of the studio sessions. After its completion, "we had two weeks to come home and learn how to be a band," Ross said.<ref name="vegasreviewjournal" /> The group played its first live show during the summer of 2005 at local Las Vegas music venue The Alley on West Charleston.<ref name="vegasreviewjournal" /> Afterwards, the band toured nationally on the Nintendo Fusion Tour with mentors Fall Out Boy, as well as [[Motion City Soundtrack]], [[the Starting Line]], and [[Boys Night Out (band)|Boys Night Out]] for the rest of 2005.<ref name="nintendofusiontour">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=htYpAAAAIBAJ&pg=2772,4320203&dq=panic+at+the+disco+nintendo+fusion+tour&hl=en| title=Fall Out Boy to lead Nintendo Fusion Tour|author=''Herald-Journal'' staff reports|date=July 29, 2005|newspaper=[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal|Herald-Journal]]|access-date=March 26, 2011}}</ref>

On May 17, 2006, Panic! at the Disco announced that original bassist Brent Wilson had left the band, "posting a statement that was both diplomatic and entirely inscrutable […] yet [failing] to mention any reason why Wilson is leaving Panic," according to [[MTV News]].<ref name="wilson">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1532098/panic-at-disco-claim-split-with-bassist-was-amicable.jhtml| title=Panic!

Apparently, Brendon and Ryan were on the speakerphone too, but they didn't say a word. They never even said they were sorry," explained Wilson. Smith wrote a lengthy e-mail back to James Montgomery of MTV News, stating, in part, "We made the decision based on Brent's lack of responsibility and the fact that he wasn't progressing musically with the band," and revealed that Wilson did not write nor play any bass present on ''Fever'': Instead, Urie recorded these parts.<ref name="wilson1">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1534131/panic-at-disco-split-gets-nasty.jhtml| title=Panic!

''Pretty. Odd.''{{'s}} touring was also defined by a larger effort to remain [[Environmentalism|environmentally]] conscious.

"And there was really no argument, which is really the best way that could've worked out." Ross said the split was largely due to creative differences between him and Urie.
