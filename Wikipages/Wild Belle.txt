Their song "Keep You" was played in the movie "[[Pitch Perfect]]" and in "[[The Vampire Diaries]]" season 4, episode 3. In 2015 Wild Belle worked with [[Diplo]] and DJEMBA DJEMBA to write "[[Be Together (Major Lazer song)|Be Together]]", which is the first track off Major Lazer's third album ''[[Peace Is the Mission]]''. The song is about a potential, but unlikely relationship. The film clip for "Be Together" depicts a widow and her partner's funeral, with flash backs to the day he dies in a motorcycle accident.

==Background==
Elliot and Natalie Bergman are two of four children born to musician parents, who brought them up in a house full of music. Elliot, the older sibling, is a multi-instrumentalist who studied at the [[University of Michigan]] where he started an [[Afrobeat]] band called Nomo. His younger sister, Natalie, started performing with Nomo, playing tambourine and singing backing vocals when she was sixteen.

This collaboration came about almost by accident. NOMO's Elliot Bergman had spent the better part of the summer building and recording electric [[kalimbas]] in Brooklyn, when label-mate, producer/multi-instrumentalist [[Shawn Lee (musician)|Shawn Lee]] asked him to send over a kalimba track for his new album. Lee, based in London, added some funky drums, bass and a smattering of steel drums, and sent it back to Bergman. When Bergman's sister, Natalie, heard the instrumental track destined for Shawn's album, she decided that she had to add some vocals. She stayed up all night writing the tune and recorded the vocals in Garage Band. The happy result is a great groove called "Upside Down", and NOMO's first vocal tune in ages.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wild Belle – 'Upside Down'|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJPrsTS19x4}}</ref>
Elliott and Natalie decided to branch off with their own project and chose the name, Wild Belle.<ref name="nme">{{cite web|title=Wild Belle – 'Isles'|date=2013-03-08|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/wild-belle/14190|publisher=NME|access-date=12 March 2013}}</ref>

===2013: ''Isles''===
