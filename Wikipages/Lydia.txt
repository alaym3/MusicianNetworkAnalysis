'''Lydia''' ([[Lydian language|Lydian]]: ‎𐤮𐤱𐤠𐤭𐤣𐤠, ''Śfarda''; [[Aramaic]]: ''Lydia''; {{lang-el|Λυδία}}, ''Lȳdíā''; {{lang-tr|Lidya}}) was an [[Iron Age]] [[Monarchy|kingdom]] of western [[Asia Minor]] located generally east of ancient [[Ionia]] in the modern western [[Turkey|Turkish]] provinces of [[Uşak Province|Uşak]], [[Manisa Province|Manisa]] and inland [[Izmir Province|İzmir]]. The language of its population, known as [[Lydian language|Lydian]], was a member of the [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]] branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language family]]. Its capital was [[Sardis]].<ref name="rhodes">Rhodes, P.J. ''A History of the Classical Greek World 478–323 BC''. 2nd edition. Chichester: Wiley-Blackwell, 2010, p. 6.</ref>

The Kingdom of Lydia existed from about 1200 BC to 546 BC. At its greatest extent, during the 7th century BC, it covered all of western [[Anatolia]]. In 546 BC, it became a province of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persian Empire]], known as the [[Lydia (satrapy)|satrapy of Lydia]] or ''Sparda'' in [[Old Persian]]. In 133 BC, it became part of the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] [[Asia (Roman province)|province of Asia]].

[[Coin]]s were invented in Lydia around the 7th century BC.<ref>"Lydia" in ''Oxford Dictionary of English''. [[Oxford University Press]], 2010. Oxford Reference Online. 14 October 2011.</ref>

The [[endonym]] ''Śfard'' (the name the [[Lydians]] called themselves) survives in bilingual and trilingual stone-carved notices of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]: the [[satrapy]] of ''Sparda'' ([[Old Persian]]),  ''Saparda'', [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]] ''Sapardu'', [[Elamitic]] ''Išbarda'', Hebrew {{Script/Hebrew|סְפָרַד}}.<ref>{{cite book|title=Iranica in the Achaemenid period (ca. 530–330 B.C.): Texts|last=Tavernier|first=J.|publisher=Peeters|year=2007|isbn=978-90-429-1833-7|pages=91}}</ref> These in the Greek tradition are associated with [[Sardis]], the capital city of King [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges]], constructed during the 7th century BC. Lydia is called ''Kisitan''  by [[Hayton of Corycus]] (in ''The Flower of the History of the East''), a name which was corrupted to ''Quesiton'' in ''[[The Travels of Sir John Mandeville]]''.

The region of the Lydian kingdom was during the 15th–14th centuries BCE part of the [[Arzawa]] kingdom. However, the Lydian language is usually not categorized as part of the Luwic subgroup, unlike the other nearby Anatolian languages [[Luwian language|Luwian]], [[Carian language|Carian]], and [[Lycian language|Lycian]].<ref>I. Yakubovich, Sociolinguistics of the Luvian Language, Leiden: Brill, 2010, p. 6</ref>

[[File:Vue_sur_la_plaine_alluviale_du_Méandre.JPG|thumb|[[Büyük Menderes River]] also known as Maeander is river in Lydia.]]

The boundaries of historical Lydia varied across the centuries. It was bounded first by [[Mysia]], [[Caria]], [[Phrygia]] and coastal [[Ionia]]. Later, the military power of [[Alyattes of Lydia|Alyattes]] and [[Croesus]] expanded Lydia, which, with its capital at [[Sardis]], controlled all Asia Minor west of the River Halys, except [[Lycia]]. After the Persian conquest the River [[Maeander]] was regarded as its southern boundary, and during imperial Roman times Lydia comprised the country between Mysia and Caria on the one side and Phrygia and the [[Aegean Sea]] on the other.

== Language ==
The [[Lydian language]] was an [[Indo-European language]] in the [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian language family]], related to [[Luwian]] and [[Hittite language|Hittite]]. Due to its fragmentary attestation, the meanings of many words are unknown but much of the grammar has been determined. Similar to other Anatolian languages, it featured extensive use of [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefixes]] and [[grammatical particle]]s to chain clauses together.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutturkey.com/lidya.htm|title=Lydia – All About Turkey|website=www.allaboutturkey.com}}</ref> Lydian had also undergone extensive [[Syncope (phonology)|syncope]], leading to numerous consonant clusters atypical of Indo-European languages. Lydian finally became [[extinct language|extinct]] during the 1st century BC.

== History ==
=== Early history: Maeonia and Lydia ===
[[File:Kroisos_stake_Louvre_G197.jpg|thumb|left| Croesus at the stake. Side A from an Attic red-figure amphora, ca. 500–490 BC]]

[[File:Alyattes.png|thumb|Tomb of [[Alyattes]].]]
Lydia developed after the decline of the [[Hittite Empire]] in the 12th century BC. In Hittite times, the name for the region had been [[Arzawa]]. According to Greek source, the original name of the Lydian kingdom was ''Maionia'' (Μαιονία), or ''Maeonia'': [[Homer]] (''[[Iliad]]'' ii. 865; v. 43, xi. 431) refers to the inhabitants of Lydia as ''Maiones'' (Μαίονες).<ref>As for the etymologies of ''Lydia'' and ''Maionia'', see H. Craig Melchert [http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/Melchert/webpage/molybdos.pdf "Greek ''mólybdos'' as a Loanword from Lydian"], [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], pp. 3, 4, 11 (fn. 5).</ref> Homer describes their capital not as Sardis but as ''Hyde'' (''Iliad'' xx. 385); Hyde may have been the name of the district in which Sardis was located.<ref>See Strabo xiii.626.</ref> Later, [[Herodotus]] (''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' i. 7) adds that the "Meiones" were renamed Lydians after their king [[Lydus]] (Λυδός), son of [[Atys of Lydia|Atys]], during the mythical epoch that preceded the Heracleid dynasty. This [[etiology|etiological]] [[eponym]] served to account for the [[Greek language|Greek]] ethnic name ''Lydoi'' (Λυδοί). The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term for Lydians, ''[[Ludim|Lûḏîm]]'' (לודים), as found in the [[Book of Jeremiah]] (46.9), has been similarly considered, beginning with [[Flavius Josephus]], to be derived from [[Lud son of Shem]];<ref>{{cite book|first=Augustin|last=Calmet|title=Dictionary of the Holy Bible|url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryholyb00calmgoog|publisher=Crocker and Brewster|year=1832|page=648}}</ref> however, [[Hippolytus of Rome]] (234 AD) offered an alternative opinion that the Lydians were descended from [[Ludim]], son of [[Mizraim]]. During Biblical times, the Lydian warriors were famous archers. Some Maeones still existed during historical times in the upland interior along the [[Hermus (river)|River Hermus]], where a town named Maeonia existed, according to [[Pliny the Elder]] (''Natural History'' book v:30) and [[Hierocles (author of Synecdemus)|Hierocles]] (author of Synecdemus).

===In Greek mythology===<!--"Lydian mythology" links here ('Cultural depictions of spiders' article)-->
Lydian mythology is virtually unknown, and their literature and rituals have been lost due to the absence of any monuments or archaeological finds with extensive inscriptions; therefore, myths involving Lydia are mainly from [[Greek mythology]].

For the Greeks, [[Tantalus]] was a primordial ruler of mythic Lydia, and [[Niobe]] his proud daughter; her husband [[Amphion and Zethus|Amphion]] associated Lydia with [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] in Greece, and through [[Pelops]] the line of Tantalus was part of the [[founding myth]]s of [[Mycenae]]'s second dynasty. (In reference to the myth of [[Bellerophon]], Karl Kerenyi remarked, in ''The Heroes of The Greeks'' 1959, p.&nbsp;83. "As [[Lycia|Lykia]] was thus connected with [[Crete]], and as the person of [[Pelops]], the hero of Olympia, connected Lydia with the Peloponnesos, so Bellerophontes connected another Asian country, or rather two, Lykia and [[Caria|Karia]], with the kingdom of [[Argolid|Argos]]".)

[[File:Πακτωλός.jpg|thumb|The [[Pactolus]] river, from which Lydia obtained [[electrum]], a combination of silver and gold.]]
In Greek myth, Lydia had also adopted the double-axe symbol, that also appears in the Mycenaean civilization, the ''[[labrys]]''.<ref>Sources noted in Karl Kerenyi, ''The Heroes of the Greeks'' 1959, p. 192.</ref> [[Omphale]], daughter of the river Iardanos, was a ruler of Lydia, whom [[Heracles]] was required to serve for a time. His adventures in Lydia are the adventures of a Greek hero in a peripheral and foreign land: during his stay, Heracles enslaved the Itones; killed Syleus, who forced passers-by to hoe his vineyard; slew the [[Serpent (mythology)|serpent]] of the river Sangarios (which appears in the heavens as the constellation [[Ophiucus]])<ref>Hyginus, ''Astronomica'' ii.14.</ref> and captured the simian tricksters, the [[Cercopes]]. Accounts tell of at least one son of Heracles who was born to either Omphale or a slave-girl: Herodotus (''Histories'' i. 7) says this was [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]] who began the line of Lydian [[Heracleidae]] which ended with the death of [[Candaules]] c. 687 BC. [[Diodorus Siculus]] (4.31.8) and [[Ovid]] (''Heroides'' 9.54) mention a son called Lamos, while pseudo-Apollodorus (''[[Bibliotheke]]'' 2.7.8) gives the name Agelaus and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (2.21.3) names Tyrsenus as the son of Heracles by "the Lydian woman". All three heroic ancestors indicate a Lydian dynasty claiming Heracles as their ancestor. Herodotus (1.7) refers to a Heraclid dynasty of kings who ruled Lydia, yet were perhaps not descended from Omphale. He also mentions (1.94) the legend that the [[Etruscan civilization]] was founded by colonists from Lydia led by [[Tyrrhenus]], brother of Lydus. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] was skeptical of this story, indicating that the [[Etruscan language]] and customs were known to be totally dissimilar to those of the Lydians. In addition, the story of the "Lydian" origins of the Etruscans was not known to [[Xanthus of Lydia]], an authority on the history of the Lydians.<ref>[[Robert Drews]], ''Herodotus 1.94, the Drought Ca. 1200 B.C., and the Origin of the Etruscans'', in ''Historia: Zeitschrift Für Alte Geschichte'', vol. 41, no. 1, 1992, pp. 14–39.</ref>

Later chronologists ignored Herodotus' statement that [[Agron of Lydia|Agron]] was the first Heraclid to be a king, and included his immediate forefathers Alcaeus, Belus and Ninus in their list of kings of Lydia. Strabo (5.2.2) has Atys, father of Lydus and Tyrrhenus, as a descendant of Heracles and Omphale but that contradicts virtually all other accounts which name Atys, Lydus and Tyrrhenus among the pre-Heraclid kings and princes of Lydia. The gold deposits in the river [[Pactolus]] that were the source of the proverbial wealth of [[Croesus]] (Lydia's last king) were said to have been left there when the legendary king [[Midas]] of [[Phrygia]] washed away the "Midas touch" in its waters.
In [[Euripides]]' tragedy ''[[The Bacchae]]'', [[Dionysus]], while he is maintaining his human disguise, declares his country to be Lydia.<ref>Euripides. ''The Complete Greek Tragedies Vol IV.'', Ed by Grene and Lattimore, line 463</ref>

=== Lydians, the Tyrrhenians and the Etruscans ===
{{main|Origins of the Etruscans}}
The relationship between the [[Etruscans]] of northern and central Italy and the Lydians has long been a subject of conjecture. While the Greek historian [[Herodotus]] stated that the Etruscans originated in Lydia, the 1st-century BC historian [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], a Greek living in Rome, dismissed many of the ancient theories of other Greek historians and postulated that the Etruscans were indigenous people who had always lived in Etruria in Italy and were different from both the [[Pelasgians]] and the Lydians.<ref name=Dionysius>{{cite book |author=Dionysius of Halicarnassus |author-link=Dionysius of Halicarnassus |title=Roman Antiquities |at=Book I, Chapters 30 1}}</ref> Dionysius noted that the 5th-century historian [[Xanthus of Lydia]], who was originally from [[Sardis]] and was regarded as an important source and authority for the history of Lydia, never suggested a Lydian origin of the Etruscans and never named Tyrrhenus as a ruler of the Lydians.<ref name=Dionysius/>

In modern times, all the evidence gathered so far by etruscologists points to an indigenous origin of the Etruscans.<ref name=Turfa2017>{{cite book |last1=Turfa|first1= Jean MacIntosh |author-link1=Jean MacIntosh Turfa|year=2017 |chapter= The Etruscans|editor1-last= Farney|editor1-first=Gary D. |editor2-last=Bradley |editor2-first=Gary |title=The Peoples of Ancient Italy |language=en |location=Berlin |publisher= De Gruyter|pages=637–672 |doi=10.1515/9781614513001 |isbn=978-1-61451-520-3 }}</ref><ref name=DeGrummond2014>{{cite book |last1= De Grummond |first1=Nancy T.|author-link1= Nancy Thomson de Grummond|year=2014 |chapter=Ethnicity and the Etruscans|editor1-last=McInerney |editor1-first=Jeremy |title=A Companion to Ethnicity in the Ancient Mediterranean |location=Chichester, UK |publisher= John Wiley & Sons, Inc |pages=405–422 |doi=10.1002/9781118834312 |isbn=9781444337341 }}</ref> The classical scholar [[Michael Grant (author)|Michael Grant]] commented on [[Herodotus]]' story, writing that it "is based on erroneous etymologies, like many other traditions about the origins of 'fringe' peoples of the Greek world".<ref>{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Michael|title=The Rise of the Greeks|year=1987|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|isbn=978-0-684-18536-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jeVYyDQqQD8C&q=Michael+Grant,+Lydians+origins+Etruscans&pg=PT181|page=311}}</ref> Grant writes there is evidence that the Etruscans themselves spread it to make their trading easier in Asia Minor when many cities in Asia Minor, and the Etruscans themselves, were at war with the Greeks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Michael|title=The Etruscans|year=1980|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|isbn=978-0-9650356-8-2|location= London}}</ref> The French scholar [[Dominique Briquel]] also disputed the historical validity of Herodotus' text.

A 2013 genetic study suggested that the maternal lineages – as reflected in [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) – of western Anatolians, and the modern population of Tuscany had been largely separate for 5,000 to 10,000 years (with a 95% [[credible interval]]); the mtDNA of Etruscans was most similar to modern Tuscans and Neolithic populations from [[Central Europe]].

===First coinage===
[[File:BMC 06.jpg|thumb|Early 6th century BC Lydian electrum coin (one-third stater denomination).]]
{{See also|Croeseid}}
According to [[Herodotus]], the Lydians were the first people to use gold and silver [[coin]]s and the first to establish retail shops in permanent locations.<ref>Herodotus. ''Histories'', I, 94.</ref> It is not known, however, whether Herodotus meant that the Lydians were the first to use coins of pure gold and pure silver or the first precious metal coins in general. Despite this ambiguity, this statement of Herodotus is one of the pieces of evidence most often cited on behalf of the argument that Lydians invented coinage, at least in the West, although the first coins (under [[Alyattes I]], reigned c.591–c.560 BC) were neither gold nor silver but an alloy of the two called [[electrum]].<ref>Carradice and Price, Coinage in the Greek World, Seaby, London, 1988, p. 24.</ref>

The dating of these first stamped coins is one of the most frequently debated topics of ancient numismatics,<ref>N. Cahill and J. Kroll, "New Archaic Coin Finds at Sardis," American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 109, No. 4 (October 2005), p. 613.</ref> with dates ranging from 700 BC to 550 BC, but the most common opinion is that they were minted at or near the beginning of the reign of King Alyattes (sometimes referred to incorrectly as Alyattes II).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://iranicaonline.org/articles/croesus|title=CROESUS – Encyclopaedia Iranica|website=iranicaonline.org|access-date=Sep 28, 2020}}</ref><ref>A.

The largest of these coins are commonly referred to as a 1/3 [[stater]] (''trite'') denomination, weighing around 4.7&nbsp;grams, though no full staters of this type have ever been found, and the 1/3 stater probably should be referred to more correctly as a stater, after a type of a transversely held scale, the weights used in such a scale (from ancient Greek ίστημι=to stand), which also means "standard."<ref>L.

There is disagreement, however, over whether the fractions below the twelfth are actually Lydian.<ref>M. Mitchiner, Ancient Trade and Early Coinage, Hawkins Publications, London, 2004, p. 219.</ref>

Alyattes' son was [[Croesus]] (Reigned c.560–c.546 BC), who became associated with great wealth. Croesus is credited with issuing the ''[[Croeseid]]'', the first true [[gold coin]]s with a standardised purity for general circulation,<ref name="WM49"/> and the world's first [[bimetallism|bimetallic monetary system]] circa 550 BCE.<ref name="WM49"/>

It took some time before ancient coins were used for commerce and trade. Even the smallest-denomination electrum coins, perhaps worth about a day's subsistence, would have been too valuable for buying a loaf of bread.<ref>"Hoards, Small Change, and the Origin of Coinage," Journal of the Hellenistic Studies 84 (1964), p. 89</ref> The first coins to be used for retailing on a large-scale basis were likely small silver fractions, Hemiobol, [[Ancient Greek coinage]] minted in [[Cyme (Aeolis)]] under [[Hermodike II]] then by the [[Ionians|Ionian Greeks]] in the late sixth century BC.<ref>M. Mitchiner, p. 214</ref>

Sardis was renowned as a beautiful city. Around 550 BC, near the beginning of his reign, Croesus paid for the construction of the [[temple of Artemis]] at [[Ephesus]], which became one of the [[Seven Wonders of the ancient world]]. Croesus was defeated in battle by [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus II]] [[Achaemenid Empire|of Persia]] in 546 BC, with the Lydian kingdom losing its autonomy and becoming a Persian [[satrapy]].

===Autochthonous dynasties===
{{Main|List of Kings of Lydia}}
According to [[Herodotus]], Lydia was ruled by three dynasties from the second millennium BC to 546 BC. The first two dynasties are legendary and the third is historical. Herodotus mentions three early Maeonian kings: [[Manes of Lydia|Manes]], his son [[Atys of Lydia|Atys]] and his grandson [[Lydus]].<ref name="H80">{{harvnb | Herodotus | de Sélincourt | 1954 | p=80}}</ref> Lydus gave his name to the country and its people. One of his descendants was [[Iardanus of Lydia|Iardanus]], with whom [[Heracles]] was in service at one time. Heracles had an affair with one of Iardanus' slave-girls and their son [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]] was the first of the Lydian Heraclids.<ref name="H43">{{harvnb | Herodotus | de Sélincourt | 1954 | p=43}}</ref>

The Maeonians relinquished control to the [[Heracleidae]] and Herodotus says they ruled through 22 generations for a total of 505 years from c. 1192 BC. The first Heraclid king was [[Agron of Lydia|Agron]], the great-grandson of Alcaeus.<ref name="H43"/> He was succeeded by 19 Heraclid kings, names unknown, all succeeding father to son.<ref name="H43"/> In the 8th century BC, [[Meles of Lydia|Meles]] became the 21st and penultimate Heraclid king and the last was his son [[Candaules]] (died c. 687 BC), who was assassinated and succeeded by his former friend [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges]], who began the Mermnad dynasty.<ref>{{harvnb | Herodotus | de Sélincourt | 1954 | pp=43–46}}</ref><ref name="BM82">{{harvnb | Bury | Meiggs | 1975 | p=82}}</ref>

The capital was relocated from Hyde to Sardis. Barbarian [[Cimmerians]] sacked many Lydian cities, except for Sardis. Gyges was the son of Dascylus, who, when recalled from banishment in Cappadocia by the Lydian king Myrsilos—called Candaules "the Dog-strangler" (a title of the Lydian Hermes) by the Greeks—sent his son back to Lydia instead of himself. Gyges turned to Egypt, sending his faithful Carian troops along with Ionian mercenaries to assist Psammetichus in ending Assyrian domination. Some Bible scholars believe that Gyges of Lydia was the Biblical character [[Gog and Magog|Gog]], ruler of Magog, who is mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel and the [[Book of Revelation]].

| [[Sadyattes]] (c. 603 – c. 591 BC). Herodotus wrote (in his Inquiries) that he fought with [[Cyaxares]], the descendant of [[Deioces]], and with the [[Medes]], drove out the [[Cimmerians]] from Asia, captured [[Smyrna]], which had been founded by colonists from Colophon, and invaded the city-states [[Clazomenae]] and [[Miletus]].<ref>{{harvnb | Herodotus | de Sélincourt | 1954 | pp=46–47}}</ref>
| [[Alyattes of Lydia|Alyattes]] (c. 591–560 BC). One of the greatest kings of Lydia. When [[Cyaxares]] attacked Lydia, the kings of [[Cilicia]] and [[Babylon]] intervened and negotiated a peace in 585 BC, whereby the River [[Halys River|Halys]] was established as the Medes' frontier with Lydia.<ref>{{harvnb | Herodotus | de Sélincourt | 1954 | pp=43–48}}</ref> Herodotus writes:

{{quote|On the refusal of Alyattes to give up his supplicants when [[Cyaxares]] sent to demand them of him, war broke out between the Lydians and the Medes, and continued for five years, with various success. In the course of it the Medes gained many victories over the Lydians, and the Lydians also gained many victories over the Medes.}}

The [[Battle of the Eclipse]] was the final battle in a five year<ref>[[Herodotus]] I.74</ref> war between Alyattes of Lydia and [[Cyaxares]] of the Medes. It took place on 28 May 585 BC, and ended abruptly due to a total solar eclipse.
| [[Croesus]] (560–546 BC). The expression "rich as Croesus" refers to this king. The Lydian Kingdom ended after Croesus attacked the Persian Empire of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus II]] and was defeated in 546 BC.<ref name="BM82"/><ref>{{harvnb | Herodotus | de Sélincourt | 1954 | pp=43–79}}</ref>}}

===Persian Empire===
{{Main|Lydia (satrapy)}}
[[File:Satrapy_of_Lydia.jpg|thumb|left|Lydia, including Ionia, during the Achaemenid Empire.]]
[[File:Xerxes I tomb Lydian soldier circa 470 BCE cleaned up.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Xerxes I]] tomb, Lydian soldier of the [[Achaemenid army]], circa 480 BC]]
In 547 BC, the Lydian king [[Croesus]] besieged and captured the Persian city of [[Pteria (Turkey)|Pteria]] in [[Cappadocia]] and enslaved its inhabitants. The Persian king [[Cyrus The Great]] marched with his army against the Lydians. The [[Battle of Pteria]] resulted in a stalemate, forcing the Lydians to retreat to their capital city of Sardis. Some months later the Persian and Lydian kings met at the [[Battle of Thymbra]]. Cyrus won and captured the capital city of Sardis by 546 BC.<ref>''New Testament Cities in Western Asia Minor: Light from Archaeology on Cities of Paul and the Seven Churches of Revelation'' {{ISBN|1-59244-230-7}} p. 65</ref> Lydia became a province ([[satrapy]]) of the Persian Empire.

=== Hellenistic Empire ===
Lydia remained a satrapy after Persia's conquest by the Macedonian king [[Alexander the Great|Alexander III]] (the Great) of [[Macedon]].
 
When Alexander's empire ended after his death, Lydia was possessed by the major Asian diadoch dynasty, the [[Seleucids]], and when it was unable to maintain its territory in Asia Minor, Lydia was acquired by the [[Attalid]] dynasty of [[Pergamum]]. Its last king avoided the spoils and ravage of a Roman war of conquest by leaving the realm by testament to the [[Roman Empire]].

=== Roman province of Asia ===
[[File:Roman Empire Asia.svg|thumb|Roman province of Asia]]
[[File:15th century map of Turkey region.jpg|thumb|Photo of a 15th-century map showing Lydia]]

When the Romans entered the capital Sardis in 133 BC, Lydia, as the other western parts of the Attalid legacy, became part of the [[Asia (Roman province)|province of Asia]], a very rich [[Roman province]], worthy of a governor with the high rank of [[proconsul]]. The whole west of Asia Minor had [[Jewish]] colonies very early, and Christianity was also soon present there. [[Acts of the Apostles]] 16:14–15 mentions the baptism of a merchant woman called "Lydia" from [[Thyatira]], known as [[Lydia of Thyatira]], in what had once been the satrapy of Lydia. Christianity spread rapidly during the 3rd century AD, based on the nearby Exarchate of Ephesus.

=== Roman province of Lydia ===
Under the [[tetrarchy]] reform of Emperor [[Diocletian]] in 296 AD, Lydia was revived as the name of a separate Roman province, much smaller than the former satrapy, with its capital at Sardis.
 
Together with the provinces of [[Caria]], [[Hellespontus (province)|Hellespontus]], [[Lycia]], [[Pamphylia]], [[Phrygia prima]] and [[Phrygia secunda]], [[Pisidia]] (all in modern Turkey) and the Insulae ([[Ionian islands]], mostly in modern Greece), it formed the [[diocese]] (under a ''[[vicarius]]'') of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]]na, which was part of the [[praetorian prefecture]] of Oriens, together with the dioceses [[Pontiana]] (most of the rest of Asia Minor), Oriens proper (mainly Syria), Aegyptus (Egypt) and [[Thraciae]] (on the Balkans, roughly Bulgaria).

=== Byzantine (and Crusader) age ===
Under the Byzantine emperor Heraclius (610–641), Lydia became part of [[Anatolikon]], one of the original ''[[Theme (Byzantine administrative unit)|themata]]'', and later of [[Thrakesion]]. Although the [[Seljuk Turks]] conquered most of the rest of Anatolia, forming the [[Sultanate of Ikonion]] (Konya), Lydia remained part of the Byzantine Empire. While the Venetians occupied Constantinople and Greece as a result of the [[Fourth Crusade]], Lydia continued as a part of the Byzantine [[rump state]] called the [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicene Empire]] based at [[İznik|Nicaea]] until 1261.

=== Under Turkish rule ===
Lydia was captured finally by Turkish ''[[Anatolian Turkish Beyliks|beylik]]s'', which were all absorbed by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] state in 1390. The area became part of the Ottoman [[Aidin Vilayet]] (''[[province]]''), and is now in the modern republic of [[Turkey]].

== Christianity ==
Lydia had numerous Christian communities and, after Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire in the 4th century, Lydia became one of the provinces of the diocese of Asia in the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. 
 
The ecclesiastical province of Lydia had a metropolitan diocese at [[Sardis]] and suffragan dioceses for [[Alaşehir|Philadelphia]], [[Thyatira]], [[Tripolis (Phrygia)|Tripolis]], [[Settae]], [[Gordus (Lydia)|Gordus]], [[Tralles]], [[Silandus]], [[Maeonia (city)|Maeonia]], [[Apollonos Hierum]], [[Mostene]], [[Apollonias]], [[Attalia]], [[Hyrcania]], Bage, [[Balandus]], [[Hermocapella]], [[Hierocaesarea]], [[Acrassus]], [[Dalda]], [[Stratonicia]], [[Cerasa]], [[Jabala|Gabala]], [[Satala]], [[Aureliopolis]] and [[Hellenopolis]]. Bishops from the various dioceses of Lydia were well represented at the Council of Nicaea in 325 and at the later ecumenical councils.<ref>Le Quien, ''Oriens Christianus'', i. 859–98</ref>
