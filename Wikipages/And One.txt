'''And One''' is a German [[New wave music|new wave]], [[synthpop]], and [[electronic body music|EBM]] band founded by Steve Naghavi and Chris Ruiz in 1989.

==History==
The band formed after Steve Naghavi and Chris Ruiz met in 1989 at a [[Berlin]] [[Nightclub|club]].<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/and-one-mn0000019161 | title=And One Biography | work=[[Allmusic]] | access-date=September 11, 2012 | archive-date=July 13, 2013 | archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6I55nsK2R?url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/and-one-mn0000019161 | url-status=live }}</ref> Being fans of early EBM music, Naghavi and Ruiz decided to follow in the footsteps of new wave/synthpop band [[Depeche Mode]] by using two keyboards and a beatbox.  Jason Ankeny of [[AllMusic]] called their 1990 single, "Metal Hammer", a "significant club hit".<ref name=allmusic/> The duo became a trio with the addition of Alex Two, prior to the release of their debut album, ''[[Anguish (album)|Anguish]]'' in 1991.  That same year, they were honored as the Best New Artist in western Germany.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IE3yERse7MUC&q=%22and+one%22+%22bodypop%22&pg=PA108 | title=Synthiepop - Die gefühlvolle Kälte | language=de | author=Horst, Dirk | publisher=Norderstedt | year=2010 | isbn=9783842334229 | access-date=April 21, 2011 | archive-date=June 9, 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210609120719/https://books.google.com/books?id=IE3yERse7MUC&q=%22and+one%22+%22bodypop%22&pg=PA108 | url-status=live }}</ref>

Going into the release of ''Anguish'', they had already garnered a decent following through touring and appearances at various parties. With their debut release, they took home the Best New Artist award in Germany in 1991. Chris Ruiz left in 1992 (he would later return in 2001) while Steve Naghavi remained with the band. And One released three more albums with [[Machinery Records]], ''Flop!'' (1992), ''Spot'' (1993) and ''I.S.T.'' (1994). The band left Machinery around 1996–1997 and signed to [[Virgin Schallplatten]]. And One would release four albums on this label between 1997 and 2003: ''Nordhausen'' (1997), ''9.9.99 9 Uhr'' (1998), ''Virgin Superstar'' (2000) and ''Aggressor'' (2003).

The next And One album, ''[[Bodypop]]'', was released on 1 September 2006 by [[Out of Line Music|Out of Line]] in Europe and on 7 November 2006 on [[Metropolis Records]] in the US. The single "Military Fashion Show" preceded the album. The band pulled out of their 2007 US tour with [[VNV Nation]] for unknown reasons.<ref>{{cite web |title=And One cancels USA-tour with VNV Nation |publisher=[[Side-Line]] |date=22 June 2007 |url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=23926_0_2_0_C |access-date=2010-03-26 |archive-date=2012-06-04 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68As7kwdK?url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=23926_0_2_0_C |url-status=live }}</ref>

In November 2007, And One announced the release of ''Bodypop 1½'',<ref>{{cite web |title=And One covers D.A.F, Depeche Mode, Front 242, The Cure and Nitzer Ebb |publisher=[[Side-Line]] |date=5 November 2007 |url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=26919_0_2_0_C |access-date=2010-03-26 |archive-date=2012-06-04 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68As8nM2m?url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=26919_0_2_0_C |url-status=live }}</ref> an EP with [[Cover versions|covers]] of songs by Depeche Mode ("[[Never Let Me Down Again]]"), [[Front 242]] ("Operating Tracks"), [[Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft|D.A.F.]] ("Der Mussolini"), [[Nitzer Ebb]] ("I Give to You") and [[The Cure]] ("[[Kyoto Song]]"). Three weeks later, the EP was cancelled and a full-length cover album announced.<ref>{{cite web |title=And One cancels release 'Bodypop 1½' MCD |publisher=[[Side-Line]] |date=27 November 2007 |url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=27356_0_2_0_C |access-date=2010-03-26 |archive-date=2012-06-04 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68As9dKKR?url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=27356_0_2_0_C |url-status=live }}</ref> The album was finally released on 30 January 2009, but with a completely different track listing, featuring live cover versions of various synthpop hits such as [[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s "[[Blue Monday (New Order song)|Blue Monday]]" and [[Pet Shop Boys]]' "[[It's a Sin]]".

And One released the album, ''Zerstörer'' ("''Destroyer")'' in early 2011, composed of four studio songs and three live performances, including ''Zerstörer'' (Peine I.S.T. Die Ansage 2011 Mix).

The band's next album, ''Tanzomat'', was released on March 4, 2011. A single, "Zerstörer" was released on January 21 prior to the album, but is not included on the album.

On June 4, 2011, Chris Ruiz and Gio van Oli announced they were leaving And One; they formed a new band called PAKT.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=46339_0_2_0_C |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-06-06 |archive-date=2011-07-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722032714/http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=46339_0_2_0_C |url-status=live }}</ref> Four days later, on June 8, 2011, Steve Naghavi announced the return of both Joke Jay and Rick Schah via the band's official Facebook page. The band's new album, ''S.T.O.P.'', was released on May 25, 2012.
