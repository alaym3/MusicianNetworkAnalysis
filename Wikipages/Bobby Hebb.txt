'''Robert Von Hebb''' (July 26, 1938 – August 3, 2010)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lenta.ru/news/2010/08/05/hebb/ |title=Умер автор песни "Sunny": Культура |publisher=Lenta.ru |access-date=2015-08-19}}</ref> was an American [[R&B]] and soul singer, musician, songwriter, recording artist, and performer known for his 1966 hit entitled "[[Sunny (Bobby Hebb song)|Sunny]]".

==Biography==
Hebb was born in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. His parents, William and Ovalla Hebb, were both [[blindness|blind]] musicians.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/> Hebb and older brother, Harold Hebb, performed as a song-and-dance team in Nashville beginning when Bobby was three and Harold was nine. Hebb performed on a TV show hosted by [[country music]] record producer [[Owen Bradley]], which earned him a place with [[Grand Ole Opry]] star [[Roy Acuff]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/> Hebb played [[Spoon (musical instrument)|spoon]]s and other instruments in Acuff's band. Harold later became a member of Johnny Bragg and the Marigolds. Bobby Hebb sang [[backing singer|backup]] on [[Bo Diddley]]'s "Diddley Daddy". Hebb played "West-coast-style" trumpet in a [[United States Navy]] [[jazz]] band, and replaced [[Mickey Baker]] in [[Mickey and Sylvia]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/>

On November 23, 1963, the day after [[John F. Kennedy]]'s assassination, Bobby Hebb's brother, Harold, was killed in a [[knife fight]] outside a Nashville [[nightclub]].<ref name="LarkinSM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Soul Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-733-9|page=111}}</ref> Hebb was devastated by both events and sought comfort in songwriting. Though many claim that the song he wrote after both tragedies was the optimistic "[[Sunny (Bobby Hebb song)|Sunny]]", Hebb himself stated otherwise. He immersed himself in the [[Gerald Wilson]] album ''You Better Believe It!'' for comfort.

<blockquote>All my intentions were just to think of happier times – basically looking for a brighter day – because times were at a low tide. After I wrote it, I thought "Sunny" just might be a different approach to what Johnny Bragg was talking about in "[[Just Walkin' in the Rain]]".{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}</blockquote>

"Sunny" was recorded in New York City after demos were made with the record producer [[Jerry Ross (record producer)|Jerry Ross]]. Released as a single in 1966, "Sunny" reached No. 2 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], No. 3 on the R&B charts, and No. 12 in the United Kingdom.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book| first= Joseph| last= Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location= London| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/205 205]| isbn= 0-214-20512-6| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/205}}</ref><ref name=whitburn>{{cite book|first=Joel|last=Whitburn|year=2003|title=Top Pop Singles 1955–2002|edition=1st|publisher=Record Research Inc.|location=Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin|isbn=0-89820-155-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/joelwhitburnstop00whitbur/page/309 309]|url=https://archive.org/details/joelwhitburnstop00whitbur/page/309}}</ref><ref name="betts">{{cite book| first= Graham| last= Betts| year=2004| title= Complete UK Hit Singles 1952–2004| edition= 1st|publisher= Collins| location= London| isbn= 0-00-717931-6| page=350}}</ref> When Hebb toured with [[The Beatles]] in 1966 his "Sunny" was, at the time of the tour, ranked higher than any Beatles song then on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] rated "Sunny" number 25 in its "Top 100 songs of the century".

In 1976, Hebb released a newly recorded disco version entitled "[[Sunny '76]]".<ref name="LarkinSM"/> The single was a minor hit reaching No. 94 on the R&B chart.

Hebb also had lesser [[hit record|hits]] with his "A Satisfied Mind" in 1966<ref name="LarkinSM"/> (No. 39 on the Billboard chart and No. 40 on the R&B chart) and "Love Me" in 1967 (No. 84),<ref name=whitburn/> and wrote many other songs, including [[Lou Rawls]]' 1971 hit "A Natural Man" (co-written with comedian [[Sandy Baron]]). Six years prior to "Sunny", Hebb reached the New York City Top 50 with a remake of Roy Acuff's "Night Train to Memphis". In 1972, his single "Love Love Love" reached No. 32 on the UK charts.<ref name="betts"/>

After a recording gap of 35 years, Hebb recorded ''That's All I Wanna Know'', his first commercial release since ''Love Games'' for [[Epic Records]] in 1970. It was released in Europe in late 2005 by Tuition, a [[popular music|pop]] [[Independent record label|indie]] label. Two new duet versions of "Sunny" were issued, one with [[Astrid North]] and the other with Pat Appleton. In October 2008, he [[concert tour|toured]] and played in [[Osaka]] and Tokyo in Japan.

==Death==
Hebb continued to live in his hometown of [[Nashville, Tennessee]], until his death at age 72. On August 3, 2010, Hebb died from [[lung cancer]] while being treated at TriStar Centennial Medical Center, located in Nashville.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/38543709/ns/today-entertainment/| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806040240/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/38543709/ns/today-entertainment| url-status=dead| archive-date=August 6, 2010|title=Bobby Hebb, singer of 1966 hit "Sunny", dies at 72 | date=August 3, 2010 | agency =[[Associated Press]] story | publisher=[[MSNBC]] | access-date=August 3, 2010}}</ref> He is interred at Nashville's [[Spring Hill Cemetery (Nashville)|Spring Hill Cemetery]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://obits.tennessean.com/obituaries/tennessean/obituary.aspx?n=robert-alvin-von-hebb-bobby&pid=144503179 | title=Robert Alvin "Bobby" VON HEBB| website=Tennessean | access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref>
