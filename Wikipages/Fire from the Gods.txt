'''Fire from the Gods''' is an American [[rap metal]] band formed in [[Austin, Texas]] during the late 2000s. The band is signed to [[Eleven Seven Label Group|Eleven Seven Music]] and consists of lead guitarist Drew Walker, bassist Bonner Baker, rhythm guitarist Jameson Teat, drummer Richard Wicander and lead vocalist AJ Channer.

==History==
Fire from the Gods was formed in Austin, Texas in 2007 by guitarists Drew Walker and Tony Esparza, bassist Bonner Baker, keyboardist Jebediah Roper, drummer Chad Huff, and vocalist Michael Vincent, who came together following a local battle of the bands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/fire-from-the-gods-mn0003443600/biography|title=Fire from the Gods &#124; Biography & History|website=AllMusic}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://insiteaustin.blogspot.com/2015/08/FireFromTheGods.html|title=Fire From the Gods, Interview with Drew Walker|date=August 29, 2015}}</ref> In that same year they released a Demo - with the cover demonstrating their vocalist and keyboardist at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Fire-From-The-Gods-Demo-2007/release/9593252|title=Fire From the Gods - Demo 2007|date=2007}}</ref> Their original vocalist was Michael Vincent, who still has the recordings of their EP "Sweet Lasting Revenge" on his personal YouTube account, which also appears to have previously been the official band page.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/firefromthegods1|title=Michael Vincent Black|date=November 22, 2011}}</ref> Furthermore, their original drummer was named Chad Huff.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Fire-From-The-Gods-Sweet-Lasting-Revenge/master/1355174|title=Fire From the Gods - Sweet Lasting Revenge|date=2012}}</ref> Their musical genre and influences are described as "blending hip-hop, metal and hardcore".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rockrevoltmagazine.com/indie-band-of-the-week-fire-from-the-gods/|title=INDIE BAND OF THE WEEK: FIRE FROM THE GODS|date=March 15, 2015}}</ref>

Judson Curtis replaced Chad Huff on drums in time for the "Sweet Lasting Revenge" EP and Michael would be replaced on vocals by Eric July for "Politically Incorrect". Serious overhaul took place at the end of 2013 where the band continued with a new lineup in which Jameson Teat and Richard Wicander replaced Tony Esparza and Judson Curtis on rhythm guitar and drums respectively. Chris Mardis was originally hired as a fill-in vocalist after departure of Eric July at this same time, but then stayed onboard when the band officially added A.J. Channer in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://madnesstocreation.net/2017/08/03/aj-channer-fire-gods-talks-police-brutality-chester-bennington-ahead-passionate-performance-vans-warped-tour/|title=A.J. Channer from Fire of the Gods interview|date=August 3, 2017}}</ref> Following the departure of Mardis in 2016 as they were recording "Narrative", Channer became the sole vocalist.

The band were first signed by Rise Records for their 2016 release ''Narrative'', which was produced by [[David Bendeth]]. The album contained the hit singles "Excuse Me" and "End Transmission", and tackled controversial subjects such as racism and abuse of power. In 2017 the band issued a re-release of their 2016 album Narrative called Narrative Retold with the addition of two new songs, "The Voiceless" and "The Taste", both of which were produced by [[Korn]]'s [[Jonathan Davis]]. Following the release of Narrative Retold, the band went on tour with [[Born of Osiris]], [[Volumes (band)|Volumes]], [[Within the Ruins]], and [[Oceans Ate Alaska]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newnoisemagazine.com/fire-gods-born-osiris-tour/|title=Fire From The Gods Tour Kicks Off This Week with Born Of Osiris & More|date=February 13, 2017}}</ref>

In 2019, the band signed with [[Five Finger Death Punch]] guitarist's [[Zoltan Bathory]] record label Eleven Seven, and released their second album ''American Sun'' on November 1, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sidestagemagazine.com/fire-from-the-gods-announce-new-album-american-sun/|title=Fire From The Gods Announce New Album American Sun|first=Side Stage|last=Magazine|date=August 29, 2019|website=Side Stage Magazine}}</ref> The album was preceded by the release of a new single, "Truth To the Weak (Not Built To Collapse)", which was released on July 26, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theprp.com/2019/07/26/news/fire-from-the-gods-debut-truth-to-the-weak-not-built-to-collapse/|title=Fire From The Gods Debut "Truth To The Weak (Not Built To Collapse)"|date=July 26, 2019|website=Theprp.com}}</ref> ''American Sun'', like ''Narrative'', deals with issues such as political unrest, technological overload, political discord, and environmental apathy. Coinciding with the release of ''American Sun'', the band is supporting Five Finger Death Punch, alongside [[Bad Wolves]] and [[Three Days Grace]], on a tour that started with back-to-back shows at the Joint at the Hard Rock Hotel on November 1 and 2, 2019.
