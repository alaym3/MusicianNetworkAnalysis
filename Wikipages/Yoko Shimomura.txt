Shimomura has worked in the [[video game industry]] ever since graduating from the [[Osaka College of Music]] in 1988. From then until 1993, she worked for [[Capcom]], where she composed wholly or in part the scores for 16 games, including ''[[Final Fight (video game)|Final Fight]]'' and ''[[Street Fighter II: The World Warrior]]''.

From 1993 until 2002, Shimomura worked for [[Square (video game company)|Square]], where she composed for a further eight games. While working for Square, she was best known for her work on the soundtrack for ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', which was her last game for the company before leaving. Starting with ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' in 2003, she began working as an active freelancer, starting up a music production company known as Midiplex. Despite going freelance, she has continued to work on projects for [[Square Enix]], including all of the games in the [[Kingdom Hearts|''Kingdom Hearts'' series]], as well as for others such as ''[[The 3rd Birthday]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]''.

Other well known games for which she provided the music include ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'', ''[[Parasite Eve (video game)|Parasite Eve]]'', ''[[Legend of Mana]]'', ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles (video game)|Xenoblade Chronicles]]''. Her works have gained a great deal of popularity, and have been performed in multiple video game music concerts, including one, ''Sinfonia Drammatica'', that was focused half on her "greatest hits" album, ''[[Drammatica: The Very Best of Yoko Shimomura]]'', and half on the music of a previous concert. Music from several of her games have been published as arranged albums and as piano scores.

==Early life==
Shimomura was born on October 19, 1967, in [[Hyōgo Prefecture]], Japan.<ref name="Yokoprofile"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wayorecords.net/wayo/yoko-shimomura|title=Yôko Shimomura|website=Wayô Records|lang=fr|access-date=October 17, 2020}}</ref> She developed an interest for music at a young age, and started taking piano lessons "at the age of four or five".<ref name="ROCKETBABYint"/> She began composing her own music by playing the piano randomly and pretending to compose, eventually coming up with her own pieces, the first of which she says she still remembers how to play.<ref name="ROCKETBABYint"/> Shimomura attended [[Osaka College of Music]], and graduated as a piano major in 1988.

Upon graduation, Shimomura intended to become a piano instructor and was extended a job offer to become a piano teacher at a music store, but as she had been an avid gamer for many years she decided to send some samples of her work to various video game companies that were recruiting at the university.<ref name="GAMASUTRAint"/> [[Capcom]] invited her in for an audition and interview, and she was offered a job there. Her family and instructors were dismayed with her change in focus, as video game music was not well respected, and "they had paid [her] tuition for an expensive music school and couldn't understand why [she] would accept such a job", but Shimomura accepted the job at Capcom anyway.<ref name="ROCKETBABYint"/><ref name="GAMASUTRAint"/>

==Career==
While working for Capcom, Shimomura contributed to the soundtracks of over 16 games, including the successful ''[[Street Fighter II: The World Warrior]]'', which she composed all but three pieces for. The first soundtrack she worked on at the company was for ''Samurai Sword'' in 1988. ''[[Final Fight (video game)|Final Fight]]'', in 1989, was her first work to receive a separate soundtrack album release, on an album of music from several Capcom games.<ref name="FinalFightalbum"/> The first soundtrack album to exclusively feature her work came a year later for the soundtrack to ''Street Fighter II''.<ref name="StreetFighteralbum"/> While she began her tenure at Capcom working on games for [[video game console]]s, by 1990 she had moved to the [[arcade game]] division.<ref name="Yokoprofile"/><ref name="GAMASUTRAint"/> She was a member of the company's in-house band [[Alph Lyla]], which played various Capcom game music, including pieces written by Shimomura. She performed live with the group on a few occasions, including playing piano during Alph Lyla's appearance at the 1992 Game Music Festival.

In 1993, Shimomura left Capcom to join another game company, [[Square (video game company)|Square]]. She stated that the move was done because she was interested in writing "classical-style" music for fantasy [[role-playing game (video games)|role-playing games]]. While working for Capcom, she was in the arcade department and was unable to transfer to the console department to work on their role-playing video game series ''[[Breath of Fire]]'', although she did contribute one track to the [[Breath of Fire (video game)|first game in the series]].<ref name="GAMASUTRAint"/> Her first project at Square was the score for the [[role-playing video game]] ''[[Live A Live]]'' in 1994. While she was working on the score to ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'' the following year, she was asked to join [[Noriko Matsueda]] on the music to the futuristic [[tactical role-playing game|strategy RPG]] ''[[Front Mission]]''. Although she was overworked doing both scores and it was not the genre that she was interested in, she found herself unable to refuse after her first attempt to do so unexpectedly happened in the presence of the president of Square, Tetsuo Mizuno.<ref name="GAMASUTRAint"/> These games were followed by ''[[Tobal No. 1]]'', the last score she worked on with another composer for a decade.<ref name="Yokoprofile"/>

Over the next few years, she composed the soundtrack to several games, including ''[[Parasite Eve (video game)|Parasite Eve]]'' and ''[[Legend of Mana]]''. Of all her compositions, Shimomura considers the soundtrack to ''Legend of Mana'' the one that best expresses herself and the soundtrack remains Shimomura's personal favourite.<ref name="Biography"/><ref name="ROCKETBABYint"/> ''Parasite Eve'' on the [[PlayStation]] had the first soundtrack by Shimomura that included a vocal song, as it was the first game she had written for running on a console system that had the sound capability for one.<ref name="GAMASUTRAint"/> In 2002 she wrote the score for ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', which she has said is the most "special" soundtrack to her, as well as a turning point in her career; she named the soundtracks to ''Street Fighter II'' and ''Super Mario RPG'' as the other two significant points in her life as a composer.<ref name="GMOint"/>

''Kingdom Hearts'' was wildly successful, shipping more than four million copies worldwide;<ref name="KH4MIL"/> Shimomura's music was frequently cited as one of the highlights of the game, and the title track has been ranked as the fourth-best role-playing game title track of all time.<ref name="KHIGN"/><ref name="titletrack"/> The soundtrack has led to two albums of piano arrangements.<ref name="GMOint"/> ''Kingdom Hearts'' was the last soundtrack that she worked on at Square. After the release of ''Kingdom Hearts'' in 2002, Shimomura left Square for [[maternity leave]], and began work as a freelancer in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ga-core.net/special/sp005_4_2.php |title=ゲームミュージック＆アニメ専門店 ga-core – ジーエー・コア – |date=May 30, 2009 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530082303/http://www.ga-core.net/special/sp005_4_2.php |archive-date=May 30, 2009 }}</ref> She has built on the work she did while at Square; since leaving she has composed or is composing music for eleven ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' games and [[Nintendo]]'s [[List of Mario role-playing games#Mario & Luigi series|''Mario & Luigi'' series]]. She has also worked on many other projects, such as ''[[Heroes of Mana]]'' and various arranged albums.<ref name="Yokoprofile"/> In February 2014, Shimomura played piano at a retrospective 25th anniversary concert at Tokyo FM Hall.<ref name="famitsu.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/news/201402/12047970.html|title=『ストII』や『キングダム ハーツ』など下村陽子さん作曲活動25年間が凝縮された記念ライブが開催 - ファミ通.com}}</ref> She performed songs from games such as ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', ''[[Live a Live]]'', and ''[[Street Fighter II]]''.

==Legacy==
After composing soundtracks to over 45 different games, Shimomura has become one of the biggest names in video game music industry, and has been described as "one of the most famous video game music composers in the world".<ref name="Biography">{{cite web|url=http://www.vgmonline.net/yokoshimomura|title=Yoko Shimomura Profile|publisher=Game Music Online|author=Chris Greening|access-date=September 21, 2014}}</ref><ref name="GMOint"/> Shimomura's best works compilation album, titled ''[[List of Square Enix compilation albums#Drammatica|Drammatica: The Very Best of Yoko Shimomura]]'', was released in March 2008. The album contains compositions from ''Kingdom Hearts'' and many other games she worked on in full orchestration, with Shimomura stating that she chose music that was popular among fans and well-suited for orchestration, but had never been performed by an orchestra before.<ref name="M4Gint"/> In a 2008 interview with [[Music4Games]] regarding the project, Shimomura commented that with the sheet music generated for the project, she would be interested in pursuing a live performance of ''Drammatica'' for fans if the opportunity arose.<ref name="M4Gint"/> In March 2009, that wish was realized when it was announced that [[Arnie Roth]] would conduct the [[Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra]] at the concert Sinfonia Drammatica in the [[Stockholm Concert Hall]], which would combine music from the album with performances of [[Chris Hülsbeck]]'s Symphonic Shades concert. The concert took place in August 2009.<ref name="SEMOSDreport"/> In March 2007, Shimomura released her first non-video game album, ''Murmur'', an album of vocal songs sung by [[Chata]].<ref name="GMOint"/>

Shimomura's music for ''Kingdom Hearts'' made up one fourth of the music of the Symphonic Fantasies concerts in September 2009, which were produced by the creators of the [[Symphonic Game Music Concerts|Symphonic Game Music Concert]] series and conducted by [[Arnie Roth]].<ref name="SymFant"/> ''Legend of Mana''{{'}}s title theme was also performed by the Australian [[Eminence Symphony Orchestra]] for its classical gaming music concert ''A Night in Fantasia 2007''.<ref name="IGNFantasia"/>

Music from the original soundtrack of ''Legend of Mana'' was arranged for the piano and published by DOREMI Music Publishing. Two compilation books of music from the series have also been published as ''Seiken Densetsu Best Collection Piano Solo Sheet Music'' first and second editions, with the second including Shimomura's tracks from ''Legend of Mana''. All songs in each book have been rewritten by Asako Niwa as beginning to intermediate level piano solos, though they are meant to sound as much like the originals as possible.<ref name="SEMOsheet"/> Additionally, piano sheet music from ''Kingdom Hearts'' and ''Kingdom Hearts II'' has been published as music books by Yamaha Music Media.<ref name="YAMAHA"/>

Shimomura's first dedicated concert performance outside Japan was held at the Salle Cortot in Paris in November 2015.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Huynh|first1=Christopher|title=Wayô Records to collaborate with Yoko Shimomura for concert|url=http://www.vgmonline.net/wayo-records-to-collaborate-with-yoko-shimomura-for-concert/|publisher=Game Music Online|access-date=March 30, 2015}}</ref> Later that same month, she performed at the El Plaza Condesa in Mexico City.<ref>{{cite web|title=VCON 2015 Features Yoko Shimomura, The OneUps, Metroid Metal, and Royal Corneria Airforce|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/260245/VCON_2015_Features_Yoko_Shimomura_The_OneUps_Metroid_Metaland_Royal_Corneria_Airforce.php|website=Gamasutra|access-date=December 10, 2015}}</ref> In September 2016, some of her music for ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]'' was performed by the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in [[London]], as well as in [[Boston]], with Shimomura herself performing on piano.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Robinson|first1=Martin|title=Square Enix has taken over Abbey Road for a Final Fantasy concert tonight|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-09-07-square-enix-has-taken-over-abbey-road-for-a-final-fantasy-concert-tonight|website=Eurogamer|access-date=September 11, 2016}}</ref><ref name="FF15 Soundtrack"/>

==Musical style and influences==
Shimomura lists [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Frédéric Chopin]], and [[Maurice Ravel]] as some of her influences on her personal website.<ref name="Yokoprofile"/> She has also stated that she has enjoyed "lounge-style jazz" for a long time.<ref name="GAMASUTRAint"/> Despite these influences and her classical training, the diverse musical styles that she has used throughout her career and sometimes in the same soundtrack include "rock, [[electronica]], [[Music of Asia|oriental]], [[ambient music|ambient]], [[industrial music|industrial]], pop, symphonic, operatic, [[chiptune]], and more".<ref name="Biography"/><ref name="ROCKETBABYint"/> She draws inspiration for her songs from things in her life that move her emotionally, which she describes as "a beautiful picture, scenery, tasting something delicious, scents that bring back memories, happy and sad things... Anything that moves my emotion gives me inspiration".<ref name="ROCKETBABYint"/> Shimomura has also stated that she comes up with most of her songs when she is doing something that is "not part of [her] daily routine, like traveling."<ref name="ROCKETBABYint"/> Although her influences are mostly classical, she has said that in her opinion her "style has changed dramatically over the years, though the passion for music stays the same."<ref name="GAMASUTRAint"/> Shimomura has said that she believes that an important part of "the creative process behind music" is to "convey a subtle message, something that comes from your imagination and sticks with the listener, without being overly specific about what it means", rather than only writing simple themes with obvious messages.<ref name="GAMASUTRAint"/> She stated her favorite composition was "Dearly Beloved" from ''Kingdom Hearts''.<ref name="GMOint"/>
