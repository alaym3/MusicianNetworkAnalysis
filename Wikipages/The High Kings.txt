'''The High Kings''' is an [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish folk]] group formed in [[Dublin]] in 2008. The band consists of [[Finbarr Clancy]], [[Brian Dunphy]], [[Darren Holden (musician)|Darren Holden]], and Paul O'Brien.<ref name="about"/> As of June 2016, the group had released four studio albums, two live albums, and two live DVDs. Their first three studio albums appeared at number three or higher on the ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'' world music chart,<ref name="Billboard World Music"/> the first two went [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] in Ireland,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dyroff|first1=Denny|title=Share the Magic of Irish Music|journal=Daily Local News|date=22 March 2011|location=West Chester, PA}}</ref> and all of their albums [[Irish Albums Chart|charted in Ireland]].

After the release of their first album, the new group moved from a highly staged format to a more natural performance style. Their third album ''Friends for Life'' contains both traditional Irish songs, as well as some original songs. Since the inception of the group, it has toured Ireland, the United States, and Europe on several occasions. Although they sing mostly traditional Irish songs, they are also known to sing arrangements of songs from other genres.

==Members==

Finbarr Clancy toured the United States and Ireland in the 1990s with the [[Clancy Brothers]], one of the most successful folk groups in Irish traditional music. He sang and played 5 string banjo, electric bass and flute with the group, which consisted at the time of Finbarr's father, [[Bobby Clancy]], his uncles [[Paddy Clancy]] and [[Liam Clancy]], and his cousin, singer-songwriter [[Robbie O'Connell]]. As part of this group, Finbarr appeared in the Clancy Brothers' filmed ''Farewell to Ireland'' performance in 1996, which has since been released on DVD. He also performed on three albums with this father. He usually plays the guitar and sometimes the banjo with The High Kings.

Brian Dunphy got his first break as a performer in ''[[Riverdance]]: The Show''. After two years as part of ''Riverdance'', he became a member of The Three Irish Tenors. Dunphy had also been a member of the band Druid. He released a solo album entitled, ''Timeless,'' as well, in which Darren helped cowrite some of the original material.  Brian is the son of [[Sean Dunphy]], who represented Ireland in the [[1967 Eurovision Song Contest]]. He typically plays the [[bodhrán]] and guitar with the group.

Martin Furey, son of Irish folk musician [[Finbar Furey]], formed the band [[Bohinta]] with his sister [[Áine Furey|Áine]] in 1992. They had a top ten hit in France with the album ''Excalibur'', featuring [[Jean Reno]] as Merlin. Bohinta released two albums.
Furey left the band in September 2017.

Darren Holden starred in ''Riverdance: The Show'' on Broadway for eighteen months. He followed this success by appearing in the Broadway musical ''Movin' Out''. Holden played the role of [[Billy Joel]] both on Broadway and on a national tour of the United States (January 2004 – January 2007), as well as tours of Canada and Japan in 2006. Holden has also released three successful solo albums. ''Suddenly'' was released in 1998 and yielded three top 20 singles in Ireland and one top 30 in Finland. ''Live and Learn'' was released in the United States in March 2003, garnering three top 40 airplay hits on the country music charts. ''Roadworks'' followed in 2006 with success in Japan where it sold 20,000 copies. 
Holden plays the accordion, mandolin, guitar and keyboard with The High Kings. He continues to perform solo shows when not with The High Kings.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}
