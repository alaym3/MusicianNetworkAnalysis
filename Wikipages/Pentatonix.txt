=== Background ===
Pentatonix began with [[Kirstin Maldonado]] (born May 16, 1992), [[Mitch Grassi]] (born July 24, 1992), and [[Scott Hoying]] (born September 17, 1991) who grew up together and were schoolmates at [[Martin High School (Arlington, Texas)|Martin High School]] in [[Arlington, Texas]].<ref name="NBCbio">{{cite web |title=Biography of Pentatonix |url=http://www.nbc.com/sing-off/contestants/pentatonix/bio/ |publisher=nbc.com |access-date=June 29, 2012}}</ref> For a local radio show competition to meet the cast of ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', they arranged and submitted a trio version of "[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]," the hit song by [[Lady Gaga]] and featuring [[Beyoncé]]. Despite losing the competition, their singing sparked attention at their school, and they began performing. Their version of "Telephone" subsequently gained attention on [[YouTube]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Malkoff |first=Amy |title=An Exclusive Interview With Pentatonix's Scott Hoying |url=http://www.casa.org/content/exclusive-interview-pentatonixs-scott-hoying |work=casa.org |access-date=August 25, 2012 |date=November 27, 2011}}</ref>
