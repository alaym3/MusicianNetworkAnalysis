==History==

===2011: Beginnings===
Aggett, Dryden and Rolle have known each other from an early age, growing up on the same street and attending the same school. In regard to the name "Rudimental", Kesi Dryden said, "When I was a kid I used to go to piano lessons. There was a book called the ''Book of [[Rudiments]]'', and my teacher would always have a go at me for forgetting it. I always used to hear 'rudiments, rudiments, where's your rudiments?' When I was a teenager, I was looking for a producer name for myself, and I would call myself 'Rudiments'. And when we started collaborating and sharing music together, Rudimental sort of felt better for a band name."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.lessthan3.com/2014/08/interview-rudimental/ |title=Interview: Rudimental |publisher=Blog.lessthan3.com |date=31 July 2015 |access-date=10 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827175654/http://blog.lessthan3.com/2014/08/interview-rudimental/ |archive-date=27 August 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
