==History==
Katchafire formed in Hamilton in 1997, originally as a [[Bob Marley]] tribute band.<ref name="Gregor" /><ref name="CCL">Campbell-Livingston, Cecelia (2013) "[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/Katchafire-keeping-NZ-reggae-scene-ablaze Katchafire keeping NZ reggae scene ablaze]", ''[[Jamaica Observer]]'', 24 November 2013. Retrieved 1 December 2014</ref> The band's name derives from ''[[Catch A Fire]]'', The Wailers' debut album.<ref>{{Allmusic|id=katchafire-mn0000917365|tab=biography}}</ref> They have released six albums: ''[[Revival (Katchafire album)|Revival]]'' (2003), which featured the highest-selling New Zealand single of 2002 "Giddy Up", ''[[Slow Burning]]'' (2005)  ''[[Say What You're Thinking]]'' (2007), ''[[On the Road Again (Katchafire album)|On the Road Again]]'' (2010),<ref>[http://ripitup.co.nz/contentitem/news-new-katchafire-album-coming-october-2010/899 NEWS: New Katchafire Album Coming October 2010 - Rip It Up Magazine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101063538/http://ripitup.co.nz/contentitem/news-new-katchafire-album-coming-october-2010/899 |date=1 November 2010 }} retrieved 15-09-2010</ref> and the compilation ''Best So Far'' (2013) ''[[Legacy (Katchafire album)|Legacy]]'' (2018).<ref name="CCL" />

The band has extensively toured Australia, the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Europe]], the United States, New Caledonia, the Pacific Islands, Guam, Indonesia, Brazil including their home country of New Zealand and have played on the same bills as The Wailers, The Marley's, [[Steel Pulse]], [[Third World (band)|Third World]], [[UB40]], [[Shaggy (musician)|Shaggy]], [[Lauryn Hill]], Fiji, and [[Horace Andy]] to name a few.

==Band members==
The bands original line-up consisted of Founder Grenville Bell (Manager, Lead Guitar) with his two sons Logan (Vocals) Jordan (Drums), the line-up expanded to include eight members, including Jerry Taukamo (Lead Vocals, Lead Guitar), Thompson Hohepa (Lead Vocals), Hani Totorewa (Keyboards, Vocals), Bass duties went to a number of different musicians, Jhonny Fish (John Kennedy), Shocka ( Shane Maraki), Tere Ngarua and Travis Te Hau.

As a result of commitments with other bands, family and religion, lead singer Jerry departed from the band Katchafire with Logan stepping into the position becoming the band's new and current lead singer.

With the addition of James "Jamey" Ferguson (Vocals, Keyboard, Saxophone) and departure of Tere Ngarua opened opportunity for Ara Adams Tamatea (Bass, Band Management) and Leonard "Leon" Davey (Percussion, Vocals) not long after which allowed Grenville Bell to step out of the Management duties and continue his role as the bands Lead Guitarist and the brand "Katchafire" was realized.

The band went through yet another change in line-up as Ara stepped down from his role as manager/bass player continuing only as the bands New Zealand booking agent, with original bass player Tere Ngarua returning and Logan taking over the band management.

The current line-up:

*Logan Bell (Guitar, Vocals) 1997 - present
