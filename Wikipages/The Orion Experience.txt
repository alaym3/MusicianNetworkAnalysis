'''The Orion Experience''' (occasionally abbreviated to T.O.E.) is a New York City-based pop rock band led by singer Orion Simprini. The band's music has appeared on MTV's soundtrack to ''[[Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County|Laguna Beach]]'' and several tracks from their 2007 release, ''Cosmicandy'', were included in ''[[Zoey 101: Chasing Zoey]]''. Their track "Obsessed with You" was featured in the 2019 thriller ''The Honeymoon Phase.''

The band performed at [[Fearless Music]] in early 2007. [[Perez Hilton]] says the band's biggest single, "Obsessed with You", is a "double yum ... indie pop gem".<ref>{{cite web|date=2008-03-19|title=Listen To This: Your Love Is Better Than Cocaine|url=http://perezhilton.com/2008-03-19-listen-to-this-your-love-is-better-than-cocaine|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813074519if_/http://perezhilton.com/2008-03-19-listen-to-this-your-love-is-better-than-cocaine/?from=post#.W3E3FKHLdhE|archive-date=13 August 2018|work=PerezHilton.com|accessdate=2008-05-27}}</ref>

After the production of their single "Rich Man's Holiday" in 2014, the band went inactive. Beginning in 2016, lead singer Orion Simprini began to produce his own original music, uploaded to the band's YouTube channel as well as to Spotify and iTunes under the name Orion. Recently, due to a rise in popularity, they have started creating more music.
