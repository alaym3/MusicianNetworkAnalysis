'''The Midnight''' is a [[Synthwave (2000s genre)|synthwave]] band composed of [[Atlanta]]-based singer-songwriter Tyler Lyle and [[Los Angeles]]-based Danish-born producer, songwriter, and singer Tim McEwan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://themidnight.bandcamp.com/|title=The Midnight|website=The Midnight}}</ref>

The band was formed as a result of Lyle and McEwan meeting during a co-writing workshop in 2012 in [[North Hollywood, CA]].<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33B7uhyY4HY</ref><ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTvEwlil5HA|title=The Midnight Live Stream Video, April 10/2017|last=Tausi New VHS Technologist|date=20 April 2017|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> Inspired in part by the score for ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'', and the retro synth genre growing around its release,<ref name="auto"/> the pair wrote two singles, "WeMoveForward" and "Gloria", that would be released two years later in 2014 as part of their debut [[Extended play|EP]] titled ''Days of Thunder''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://themidnight.bandcamp.com/album/days-of-thunder|title=Days of Thunder, by The Midnight|website=The Midnight}}</ref> In 2016, the duo released a 12 track [[LP record|LP]], ''Endless Summer'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://themidnight.bandcamp.com/album/endless-summer|title=Endless Summer, by The Midnight|website=The Midnight}}</ref> followed in 2017 with the release of ''Nocturnal'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://themidnight.bandcamp.com/album/nocturnal|title=Nocturnal, by The Midnight|website=The Midnight}}</ref> which spent several weeks as a best seller on the music distribution website [[Bandcamp]] and reached number 17 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Dance/Electronic charts October 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vehlinggo.com/2017/11/12/the-midnight-interview-nocturnal/|title=Reliving the Past with The Midnight: An In-Depth Interview|date=12 November 2017|publisher=}}</ref> The band went on to perform their second sell-out concert, taking place at the Globe Theatre on [[Broadway Theater District (Los Angeles)|Broadway]] in Los Angeles in November 2017.<ref name="lamusicblog.com">{{cite web|url=http://lamusicblog.com/2017/11/review/fm-84-and-the-midnight-the-globe-theatre/|title=FM-84 and The Midnight @ The Globe Theatre - LA Music Blog|website=lamusicblog.com}}</ref>
The band had multiple collaborations with [[Timecop1983]], another retro synth genre producer. One of the collaborations appears on the album ''Nocturnal'', titled "River of Darkness". The other collaboration between them appears on the album ''Night Drive'' of [[Timecop1983]], titled "Static".

The band's motto is "{{lang|ja-Latn|[[mono no aware]]}}" ({{lang|ja|物の哀れ}}), a Japanese phrase that loosely translates to "a sense of nostalgic wistfulness and the awareness that nothing lasts forever".<ref name="Mono No Aware">{{cite web|url=https://dancingastronaut.com/2019/09/the-midnight-paint-with-vibrant-sonic-colors-as-they-prepare-their-new-lp-tour-the-world-interview/|title=The Midnight paint with vibrant sonic colors as they prepare their new LP, tour the world [Interview]|last=Dexter|first=Robyn|year=2019|website=[[Dancing Astronaut]]|accessdate=March 29, 2020}}</ref>

In 2019 McEwan appeared in the documentary film ''[[The Rise of the Synths]]'', which explored the origins and growth of the synthwave genre. McEwan appeared alongside various other composers from the scene, including [[John Carpenter]], who also starred in and narrated the film.
