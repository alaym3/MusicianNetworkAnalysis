==Biography==

===1976–1982: Early years===
Michael Tn [[Vesterbro, Copenhagen|Vesterbro]] with his mother, Doris, who died April 2010 at the age of 80, and two brothers, Dennis and Kim. Trempenau started his musical career singing in Vesterbro Ungdomsgård, a youth group club in [[Copenhagen]], and appears on their first album: ''Vi lever på Vesterbro'' (1974). In 1976, Trempenau, now known professionally as Tramp, joined the pop band [[Mabel (band)|Mabel]] as the lead singer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockdoc.dk/art10072.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030409104126/http://www.rockdoc.dk/art10072.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 9, 2003|title=Mabel|website=Rockdoc.dk}}</ref> Mabel released five studio albums and were very popular in Denmark and Spain, with Mike receiving "teen idol" status. In 1978, Mabel won the Danish Song Contest with the song "[[Boom Boom (Mabel song)|Boom Boom]]" and represented Denmark in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978]] that same year.  Later, Mabel moved to Spain and became Studs, releasing a debut self-titled album in 1981 and then moved to New York City and became Danish Lions in 1982. After recording demos, the band returned home to Denmark, however, Tramp decided to remain in America.

===1983–1992: White Lion===
Tramp met [[Vito Bratta]] and formed [[White Lion]] in 1983; the band became very successful in the mid-1980s to early '90s. White Lion released their debut album, ''[[Fight to Survive]]'', in 1985. The band achieved success with their number 8 hit [[Wait (White Lion song)|"Wait"]] and number 3 hit "[[When the Children Cry]]" from their second album, the triple-platinum selling ''[[Pride (White Lion album)|Pride]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url = {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5817|pure_url=yes}}|title = Allmusic (White Lion charts & awards)|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> The band enjoyed continued success with their third album, ''[[Big Game (album)|Big Game]]'', which achieved gold status, and their fourth album, ''[[Mane Attraction]]'', which they supported with a tour. White Lion disbanded in 1992; their first compilation album, ''[[The Best of White Lion]]'', was released not long after.

===1992–1998: Freak of Nature===
After White Lion, Tramp went on to form the [[Hard rock]] band [[Freak of Nature (band)|Freak of Nature]]. The follow-up was significantly darker and harder than White Lion. The band released three albums between 1993 and 1998: ''[[Freak of Nature (Freak of Nature album)|Freak of Nature]]'', ''[[Gathering of Freaks]]'', and ''[[Outcasts (Freak of Nature album)|Outcasts]]''. The band shared stages with [[Helloween]] and [[Dio (band)|Dio]] in Europe in 1993. Freak of Nature eventually disbanded in 1996.

===1998–2004: Solo career===
