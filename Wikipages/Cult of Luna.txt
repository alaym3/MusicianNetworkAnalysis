'''Cult of Luna''' is a Swedish [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Umeå]] founded in 1998.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/26739/Cult-of-Luna-Eternal-Kingdom/|title=Cult of Luna - Eternal Kingdom (album review )|website=Sputnikmusic.com|access-date=2016-04-27}}</ref> They are known for [[post-metal]] music similar to the contemporary bands [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]] and [[Isis (band)|Isis]]. The band was signed to [[Earache Records]] in the early 2000s and released five albums, including the commercially successful albums ''[[Salvation (Cult of Luna album)|Salvation]]'' (2004) and ''[[Somewhere Along the Highway]]'' (2006). After an extended period of inactivity, Cult of Luna returned with its [[Indie Recordings]] debut ''[[Vertikal]]'' (2013) and companion EP ''[[Vertikal II]]'' (2013), both drawing inspiration from [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1927 film, ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''. In 2016 the band released their space-themed seventh album, ''[[Mariner (album)|Mariner]]'', featuring American vocalist [[Julie Christmas]].

== History ==
=== Formation and early releases (1998–2007) ===
They formed from the remnants of a Umeå [[hardcore punk]] band called Eclipse in 1998. They slowly garnered critical appreciation and underground popularity with early releases ''[[Cult of Luna (album)|Cult of Luna]]'' (2001) and ''[[The Beyond (album)|The Beyond]]'' (2003); however, it is 2004's ''[[Salvation (Cult of Luna album)|Salvation]]'' that can be considered their 'breakthrough' release. This was followed by ''[[Somewhere Along the Highway]]'' in 2006, another largely well-received album.

In August 2006, the band released a remake of "Marching to the Heartbeats" from ''Somewhere Along the Highway'' entitled "Heartbeats" solely on the internet community [[MySpace]]. The song was available for download for a few days and was later removed. The point was to see if the song would be kept alive by [[file sharing]], and was also apparently a statement against the conservative music industry, said keyboardist Anders Teglund in an interview.<ref name="folkbladet">{{cite web|url=http://www.folkbladet.nu/2006/08/30/cult-of-luna-testar-granser/ |title=Cult of Luna testar gränser |work=Västerbottens Folkblad |access-date=November 5, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314001643/http://www.folkbladet.nu/2006/08/30/cult-of-luna-testar-granser/ |archive-date=March 14, 2007 |language=sv |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== ''Eternal Kingdom'' (2008–2011) ===
In 2008 the band released its fifth album, ''[[Eternal Kingdom]]''. It was released in Europe on June 16, followed by its release in the United States on July 8.

In 2009 they released the ''Fire Was Born'' DVD including a live performance from 2008, an interview with the band, as well as all of the band's videos.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Cult-Of-Luna-Fire-Was-Born/release/2660908|title=Cult Of Luna - Fire Was Born|website=Discogs|access-date=2016-04-27}}</ref>

On October 18, 2009, the band released ''Eviga riket'', a hardback book/[[audiobook]] covering the story and themes from ''Eternal Kingdom.'' The book and audiobook are bilingual, printed and spoken both in Swedish and English. The audiobook contains new pieces of music and soundscapes written by the band. ''Eviga riket'' was released the 23 of February 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cultofluna.com/|title=cultofluna.com|website=cultofluna.com|access-date=2016-04-27}}</ref>

=== ''Vertikal'' and ''Vertikal II'' (2012–2015) ===
On October 8, 2012, the band announced the title of their sixth studio album as ''[[Vertikal]]'', as well as the first leg of their upcoming European tour. The release dates were confirmed as November 5, with the European release on January 25, 2013, and the American release four days later on January 29, 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cultofluna.com|title=cultofluna.com|website=cultofluna.com|access-date=2016-04-27}}</ref> A companion EP, ''[[Vertikal II]]'' was released on September 20, 2013. It includes the three songs with which Cult of Luna intended to conclude ''Vertikal'' as well as a remix of "Vicarious Redemption" by [[Justin Broadrick]].

On December 17, 2013, the band announced that they'd be taking a break of sorts for the foreseeable future stating "2013 have been a very active year for us and neither do we want or think it is good to continue in that pace" they also said "Sooner or later we will return in one form or another".

In May 2014 the band curated the Beyond The Redshift festival in London, held across 3 venues with Cult Of Luna closing the festival with a headlining set at the Forum.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rocksins.com/2013/12/cult-of-luna-to-headline-curate-beyond-the-redshift-2014-london-festival-18972/|title=Cult Of Luna Announce London Beyond The Redshift Festival 2014|date=2013-12-06|website=Rocksins|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-27}}</ref>

=== New lineup and ''Mariner'' with Julie Christmas (2016-2018) ===
During the recording sessions and supporting tours for ''Vertikal'', Cult of Luna made two major lineup changes that weren't publicly addressed until 2016. While recording the album in 2012, keyboardist Anders Teglund "left the band unexpectedly" and later was replaced by Kristian Karlsson of Pg Lost.<ref name="col1"/> Founding guitarist Erik Olofsson told the band he wished to leave, and his final live performance with the band became 2014's Beyond the Redshift festival. Cult of Luna stated that while he is no longer a full-time member, "he is still a part of the Cult of Luna universe." He has been temporarily replaced by David Johansson of Kongh.<ref name="col1"/>

On April 8, 2016, Cult of Luna released its seventh studio album titled ''[[Mariner (album)|Mariner]]'' — a collaborative release with the American vocalist [[Julie Christmas]], formerly of [[Made Out of Babies]] and [[Battle of Mice]]. Contrasting the industrial- and city-focused ''Vertikal'', ''Mariner'' explores themes relating to outer space.

Before ''Mariner'' was officially released, Cult of Luna had already begun writing new music for their eighth studio album. Persson stated that the band already had the album's concept and theme in mind, stating: "The last few records have been this kind of continuous journey from the forest to the sky and I know where we're going after this."<ref name="rollingstone1"/>

Johannes Persson stated in an interview in April 2016 that in 2013 he never talked about taking a break as previously reported, "what I wanted to say [...] is that we didn't have anything planned for the future" and added "for sure I never used the word hiatus".<ref name="truemetal1"/>

In December 2016 Cult of Luna announced new live release ''Years in a Day'' scheduled for April 21, 2017. A live bundle limited to 7000 copies would feature a DVD of a show in [[Paris]] from the ''Somewhere Along the Highway'' 10th anniversary tour in 2015, 2 CDs featuring the band's performances at the [[Roadburn Festival]] in 2013 and 2016, digital audio and some other bonuses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/cultoflunamusic/photos/a.10150291785473391.343944.14897083390/10154280843568391/?type=3&theater|title=Years in a Day announcement|website=Facebook.com|access-date=2016-12-20}}</ref> Preorders of ''Years in a Day'' started on January 20, 2017 along with preorders of two live vinyl albums from the shows at [[Roadburn Festival]] in 2013 and 2016. These are the same as those included on CD in ''Years in a Day''. The two live vinyl albums are limited to 500 copies each.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/cultoflunamusic/posts/10154412725293391|title=Cult of Luna|website=Facebook.com|access-date=13 January 2018}}</ref> A live triple disc vinyl album from the show at [[La Gaîté Lyrique]] in Paris, which is the same as on the DVD in ''Years in a Day'', was also released on April 21, 2017. The vinyl is limited to 1000 copies on orange vinyl with yellow splatter. It was also released on black vinyl and CD.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Cult-Of-Luna-Live-At-La-Ga%C3%AEt%C3%A9-Lyrique-Paris/master/1167344|title=Cult Of Luna - Live At La Gaîté Lyrique: Paris|website=Discogs.com|access-date=13 January 2018}}</ref>

In November 2017 Cult of Luna announced the release of live album and documentary ''Mariner Live'' in April 2018. Prior to the official release, the band released a short version of the documentary on the making of the ''Mariner'' album and the tour in support of it on the band's YouTube channel. The live album  features the entire performance of ''Mariner'' which was recorded in November 2016 in [[Kortrijk]], [[Belgium]] .<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.revolvermag.com/music/watch-doc-cult-luna-julie-christmas-epic-mariner-collaboration|title=Watch doc on Cult of Luna, Julie Christmas' epic 'Mariner' collaboration|date=22 November 2017|magazine=[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]}}</ref>

=== ''A Dawn to Fear'' (2019–2020) ===
At the end of 2018, Cult of Luna announced the beginning of recording sessions and posted teaser photos from the studio on band's social media throughout 2019. A number of 2019 European summer festival appearances were confirmed along the way. On March 20, 2019 the band announced signing a deal with [[Metal Blade Records]] and first batch of European tour dates scheduled for autumn 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BvOyfngHCF2/|title=Cult of Luna on Instagram: “This is the first announcement of many to come, as you all guessed.

=== ''The Raging River'' and ''The Long Road North'' (2021–present) ===
On November 12, 2020 Cult of Luna announced the release of a new EP titled ''The Raging River'' for February 5, 2021 through their own newly founded label Red Creek Recordings. "''The Raging River'' feels more like a bridge. A midpoint that needs to be crossed so we can finish what we started with 2019's 'A Dawn to Fear,'" the band adds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theprp.com/2020/11/12/news/cult-of-luna-to-release-the-raging-river-in-february-mark-lanegan-to-guest/|title=Cult Of Luna To Release “The Raging River” In February, Mark Lanegan To Guest|publisher=ThePRP|access-date=November 12, 2020|date=November 12, 2020}}</ref>

On November 4, 2021, Cult of Luna announced the release of a new album titled ''The Long Road North'' for February 11, 2022.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kennelty|first=Greg|date=2021-11-05|title=CULT OF LUNA Announces New Album The Long Road North|url=https://metalinjection.net/upcoming-releases/cult-of-luna-announces-new-album-the-long-road-north|access-date=2021-11-05|website=Metal Injection|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Musical style and influences ==
Cult of Luna's sound has progressed from early material being heavily [[doom metal]]-influenced to one much less aggressive and more concerned with orchestration. Fans and critics have termed this sound [[post-metal]], [[progressive metal]], [[sludge metal]], and [[doom metal]].<ref name="pm"/><ref name="popmatters-review"/> The band is considered to be at the forefront of the genre, along with contemporary proponents [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]] and [[Isis (band)|Isis]].

Its songs are often long, slow, repetitive and crushing, heavy sections of distorted guitars often interspersed with orchestral interludes and extended, [[post-rock]]-esque forays. The group shuns conventional song structures, opting for a sound that evolves throughout a song, sometimes toward a climactic [[crescendo]], instead of a [[verse-chorus form|verse-chorus-verse]] pattern. That style, incorporating sections of "light and dark" into their music, has led to comparisons with contemporaries such as [[Isis (band)|Isis]] (with whom they have toured), [[Callisto (band)|Callisto]] and [[Pelican (band)|Pelican]], as well as the significantly older [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]]. Former singer Klas Rydberg, however, has stated that decidedly [[Radiohead]] are an influence.<ref name="spiritribe">{{cite web|url=http://www.spiritribe.com/Evetribepages/Interview/EnglishVersion/ColintUK.htm|title=Klas Rydberg interview|work=spiritribe.com/|access-date=August 25, 2006}}</ref>

== Themes ==
As the band progressed, the imagery they employed became less overt and less "[[doom metal]]". In some ways, the albums showed a shift from anger with modern society as in ''Cult of Luna'', to disgust with the ruling parties in ''The Beyond'' and ''[[Salvation (Cult of Luna album)|Salvation]]''. The [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030610/http://www.earache.com/bands/cult_of_luna/videos/leave_me_here/player.html video] for single "Leave Me Here" is concerned with propaganda and tacit governmental control over the individual. Similar concerns are addressed in contemporaries Isis' ''[[Panopticon (album)|Panopticon]]'', centered on the theme of [[Big Brother (1984)|Big Brother]]-like government surveillance. Early material made [[Christianity|Christian]] references; to [[the devil]], [[Faust]]<ref name="beyondfate">"Beyond Fate": Take a seat next to thy devil[...]Still got so much more to give in this life/I guess I'm heading for regrets/Once I sold my soul/That's one sweet regret</ref> and the [[four horsemen of the apocalypse]]. Over the course of the following albums, these seem to have disappeared, though ''[[Salvation (Cult of Luna album)|Salvation]]'' does have overarching spiritual themes.

''[[Somewhere Along the Highway]]'' is slightly different from the previous releases in its thematic basis. It focuses on personal matters, specifically male loneliness,<ref name="metalstorm">{{cite web|url=http://www.metalstorm.ee/pub/interview.php?interview_id=376|title=Erik Olofsson interview|last=Lozano|first=Francisco|work=metalstorm.ee|access-date=August 25, 2006}}</ref> instead of [[wikt: macroscopic|macroscopic]] concerns addressed in the previous albums.
