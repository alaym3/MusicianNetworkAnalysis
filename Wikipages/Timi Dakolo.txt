==Childhood and early career==
Timi Dakolo was born in [[Accra]], [[Ghana]] to a Nigerian father, [[Bayelsa]]-native David and a Ghanaian mother, Norah, who died when Dakolo was thirteen years old. Despite being born in Ghana, Timi has a Nigerian passport and does not claim dual citizenship. He was raised in [[Port Harcourt]] by his grandmother Ateni Dakolo and his aunt Susan Larry, and he credits his aunt as his early singing teacher. So deep was their relationship that Timi declined an offer to move to Lagos with his parents, opting to stay back in Port-harcourt with them.

Timi started singing in church at the age of twelve. In 2003, he joined the singing group ''Purple Love'' as a founding member. They dominated the Port Harcourt club circuit, but disbanded in 2005 as all its members had gained admission into the [[University of Port Harcourt]]. Around that same period, Timi won a local talent hunt contest ''G.E FACTO,'' which held in Port Harcourt.

==''Idols West Africa''==
In 2006, Dakolo auditioned for reality show Idols West Africa in [[Calabar]]. Timi Dakolo's songs of choice were Commissioned's ''More Than I'' and [[Lemar]]'s ''Time to Grow''. His vocals impressed the judges, and he was seen as a contender for the prize. A week before the viewing of the Top 24 performances, Dakolo received the news that his grandmother had died.

Dakolo first auditioned in [[Calabar|Calabar, Cross River State]] of [[Nigeria]] with Commissioned More Than I and Lemar's Time to Grow. [5] While in the competition, Timi Dakolo was never in the bottom 3. In the final three weeks of the competition it was revealed by the producers of the show that Timi had the highest number of votes each of those weeks.

While in the competition, Timi's grandmother died, a week before the viewing of the Top 24 performances. This was a big emotional blow to him. At that time, he turned to his Christian faith for strength to pull through in the competition. Before going to Idols West Africa, Timi was a student of Communication Studies in the [[University of Port Harcourt]].

==After ''Idol''==
After winning ''Idol West Africa'' in 2007, on January 1, 2008, on New Year's Day, Timi Dakolo was shot at the lobby of the Presidential Hotel in Port Harcourt. He had gone to the hotel to attend a church service in the company of his friends. The attack was a random act of violence by a faction of [[Niger Delta]] militants and did not target Timi. Although a hotel security guard was murdered in the attack, Timi escaped with a flesh wound, was rushed to the hospital, treated and discharged on the same day.<ref name="Timishot">'' Timi Dakolo Shot on New Year's Day'' from Ayeni The Great Blog.
