'''U.D.O.''' is a German [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band founded by lead vocalist [[Udo Dirkschneider]] in 1987.

==History==
Following Udo Dirkschneider's departure from [[Accept (band)|Accept]] in 1987, he formed his own band called U.D.O. He recruited guitarists Mathias Dieth and Peter Szigeti, bassist Frank Rittel and drummer Thomas Franke. They released their debut album titled ''[[Animal House (U.D.O. album)|Animal House]]'' on 3 November 1987, which was entirely written by Accept. They would tour with the likes of [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Lita Ford]] and [[Zodiac Mindwarp]]. Rubach, Rittel and Franke departed the band, and guitarist Andy Susemihl, bassist Thomas Smuzyszki and drummer Stefan Schwarzmann joined. The follow-up album ''[[Mean Machine (U.D.O. album)|Mean Machine]]'' was released on 10 January 1989.

Susemihl left the band, with U.D.O. now as a four-piece. The band shifted to a lighter approach with the third album ''[[Faceless World]]'', which was released on 25 February 1990, achieving great success; this being their best selling album so far. It was produced by former Accept drummer [[Stefan Kaufmann (musician)|Stefan Kaufmann]]. The fourth album ''[[Timebomb (album)|Timebomb]]'' was released on 3 April 1991. It was a more heavier album than their previous releases. In 1992, Dirkschneider put U.D.O. on hiatus to reunite with Accept.

In 1996, Dirkschneider reactivated U.D.O. with a brand new line-up; Stefan Kaufmann, now undertaking guitar duties, with guitarist Jürgen Graf and bassist Fitty Wienhold from Bullet, and Stefan Schwarzmann returning to the band. They took part in the 1997 compilation album ''[[A Tribute to Judas Priest: Legends of Metal]]'', in which they recorded the song "Metal Gods".

On 24 March 1997, U.D.O. released the fifth album ''[[Solid (U.D.O. album)|Solid]]''. It was featured on the [[Rock Hard (magazine)|Rock Hard]] magazine reader charts for more than a year after its release. The album was followed up with ''[[No Limits (U.D.O. album)|No Limits]]'' on 20 April 1998, featuring a similar songwriting approach from ''Solid''. The album features a cover of the Austrian pop band [[Supermax (band)|Supermax]]'s hit single "Love Machine". After the conclusion of the band's tour, Stefan Schwarzmann quit the band. New drummer Lorenzo Milani replaced him.

The seventh album ''[[Holy (U.D.O. album)|Holy]]'' was released on 18 October 1999, which received critical acclaim. It was a return to the guitar-driven sound similar to the ''[[Balls to the Wall]]''-era Accept. A world tour followed with dates in the United States and several other major countries. The band known as Vanize, fronted by Udo Dirkschneider's brother Peter, supported U.D.O. during the tour. Line-up changes occurred during the second part of the tour with [[Gotthard (band)|Gotthard]] guitarist Igor Gianola replacing Jürgen Graf. The tour spawned the first live album ''[[Live from Russia]]'', which was released on 15 October 2001, a 2-CD release featuring many of the classic Accept songs that have since become staples of U.D.O.'s set.

On 24 July 2002, the eighth album ''[[Man and Machine (U.D.O. album)|Man and Machine]]'' was released. It received a somewhat lukewarm reception. Despite standout songs such as the title track and "Private Eye", the album was ultimately less successful than ''Holy''. It is notable for the song "Dancing with an Angel", featuring a duet performance of Dirkschneider and vocalist [[Doro (musician)|Doro Pesch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/u-d-o-confirm-track-listing-for-man-and-machine/|title=U.D.O.
