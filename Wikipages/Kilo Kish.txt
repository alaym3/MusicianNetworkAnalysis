'''Lakisha Kimberly Robinson''' (born May 10, 1990), known professionally as '''Kilo Kish''', is an American singer-songwriter and visual artist.<ref name=complex>{{cite web|title=Who is Kilo Kish?|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/08/who-is-kilo-kish|work=Complex.com|accessdate=August 3, 2012|date=August 3, 2012|first=Lauren|last=Nostro}}</ref>

==Early life==
Kilo Kish was born in Orlando, Florida, on May 10, 1990. She went to Glen Rock Elementary School in [[Bergen County, New Jersey]], but later returned to Orlando, where she graduated from Winter Park High School.
 
Aged 18, she received a scholarship to attend the private art college [[Pratt Institute]] in New York. While taking a year off, she worked multiple jobs, before enrolling in the [[Fashion Institute of Technology]] for textile design, from which she graduated in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/kilo-kish-interview/|title=Kilo Kish Interview: Her Metamorphosis Is a Trip Worth Listening|date=2018-09-24|website=Highsnobiety|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref>

Kish began to pursue a musical career when her roommates, Smash Simmons and Mell McCloud, decided to set up an in-home studio, starting a project called the "Kool Kats Klub". It was through this exposure that she initially met [[Matt Martians]] of the neo-soul band [[The Internet (band)|The Internet]], and collaborated on [[The Jet Age of Tomorrow]]'s "Want you Still" and The Internet's "Ode to a Dream".<ref name="complex" />

==Career==
===2012: ''Homeschool''===
Kilo Kish's debut EP, ''Homeschool,'' was released on April 2, 2012, and was well received by critics, being labeled as one of the best albums of 2012 by [[Complex (magazine)|Complex]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/06/the-50-best-albums-of-2012-so-far/kilo-kish-hoomschool/ |title=Kilo Kish, Homeschool EP - The 50 Best Albums of 2012 (So Far) |publisher=Complex |date=2012-06-25 |accessdate=2016-08-26}}</ref> The EP was produced by past collaborators such as [[The Internet (band)|The Internet]] and [[Pyramid Vritra]] of [[The Jet Age of Tomorrow]], who also provided guest vocals on the project.

On July 31, Kish released "Watergun", a song produced by The Internet, via [[SoundCloud]].

On September 17, "Navy" was released on The Blue Rider record label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blueridermusic.tumblr.com/post/31735401133/we-are-really-excited-to-announce-our-second|title= We are really excited to announce our second single|author=The Blue Rider|work=blueridermusic.tumblr.com|date=September 17, 2012|accessdate=2012-09-17}}</ref> The release also contained a remix of "Navy" by [[MeLo-X]]. A video for "Navy", as directed by Kish with Ben Rayner, premiered on [[The Fader]] the same day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2012/09/17/video-kilo-kish-navy/|title= Video: Kilo Kish, "Navy"|author=Duncan Cooper|work=FADER.com|date=September 17, 2012|accessdate=2012-09-17}}</ref>

In December, Kish released ''K+ THE BOOK'', a behind-the-scenes digital art [[zine]], in extension to the mixtape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/art-design/2013/12/kilo-kish-release-the-k-book-digital-art-zine |title=Kilo Kish Releases K+ THE BOOK, a Behind-the-Scenes Digital Art Zine for Her Mixtape |publisher=Complex |date= |accessdate=2016-08-26}}</ref>
