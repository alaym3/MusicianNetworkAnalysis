==Life and career==

===1977–1999: Early life and career beginnings===
Tamar Estine Braxton was born to Michael and Evelyn Braxton in [[Severn, Maryland]] on March 17, 1977. The youngest of the Braxtons' six children, Braxton started singing as a toddler. The Braxton children would eventually enter in their church choir, where their father Michael Braxton was a pastor. She and her sisters [[Toni Braxton|Toni]], Traci, Towanda, and Trina, signed their first record deal with [[Arista Records]] in 1989. In 1990, they released their first [[single (music)|single]], "[[Good Life (The Braxtons song)|Good Life]]". "Good Life" was unsuccessful only peaking at No. 79 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|''Billboard'' Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles]] chart. At the time of the single's release, the members' age differences created a problem with marketing. Subsequently, [[The Braxtons]] were dropped from Arista Records.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

In 1991, during a showcase with [[L.A. Reid]] and [[Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds]], who were in the process of forming [[LaFace Records]], Toni Braxton, minus her four sisters, was chosen and signed as the label's first female solo artist. At the time, the remaining members were told that LaFace was not looking for another girl group since it had just signed [[TLC (band)|TLC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/538/ms_impulsive/ |title=Toni Braxton: From the heart |website=Bluesandsoul.com |access-date=August 9, 2014}}</ref><ref name="latimes1">{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2011/may/22/entertainment/la-ca-conversation-20110522 |title=Toni Braxton: The Sunday Conversation |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=May 22, 2011 |access-date=August 9, 2014}}</ref> After Toni's departure from the group, the remaining Braxtons members became [[Backup vocalist|backup]] singers for Toni's first tour, [[music videos]], and promotional appearances. She and her sisters Traci, Towanda, and Trina were featured in the music video for Toni Braxton's third single, "[[Seven Whole Days]]", from her [[Toni Braxton (album)|self-titled debut album]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

In 1993, LaFace Records [[A&R]] Vice President, Bryant Reid, signed The Braxtons to LaFace. However, the group never released an album or single for the label. When Reid moved on to work for [[Atlantic Records]], he convinced executives at [[LaFace Records|LaFace]] to allow him to take the group to Atlantic also.<ref name="latimes1"/><ref name="ReferenceA">Reynolds, J.R.

In 1996, Tamar, Trina, and Towanda returned with a new album entitled ''[[So Many Ways]]'', which peaked at No. 26 on the [[Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart|''Billboard'' R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/388935/braxtons/chart |title=The Braxtons – Chart history |website=Billboard.com |date=October 5, 1996 |access-date=May 13, 2015}}</ref> At the time of its release, Reid told ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine, "I had a vision for them then that was about young sophistication with sex appeal."

===2000–2009: ''Tamar'' and label troubles===
Later, Braxton met [[Christopher Stewart (music producer)|Christopher "Tricky" Stewart]]. She recorded her solo debut album, ''Ridiculous'', so-named for the many different musical styles on the album.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_YCgEAAAAMBAJ|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_YCgEAAAAMBAJ/page/n271 250]|publisher=Vibe Magazine|date=December 1999 – January 2000|title=Tamar: 'Ridiculous'|access-date=December 6, 2012}}</ref> The album spawned two buzz singles ("Let Him Go" and "Just Cuz") in hopes of garnering attention from the public eye; however, when the songs failed to gain impact on urban radio outlets, the album was pushed back and canceled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Tamar-Tamar/release/1563796|title=An early CD promo of Tamar's "Ridiculous"|website=Discogs.com|access-date=December 6, 2012}}</ref> That same year, Braxton was featured on Sole's, "4 The Love of You." Instead of shelving the album, [[Dreamworks Records]] abandoned 3 old tracks, added new ones, and renamed it ''[[Tamar (album)|Tamar]]''. The lead single "Get None" was produced by [[Jermaine Dupri|Jermaine "J.D." Dupri]] and also featured rap verses from him as well as former [[Jay-Z]] protégée [[Amil (rapper)|Amil]]. The song also included uncredited background vocals and songwriting by R&B singer [[Mýa]]. As soon as the song began to pick up airplay, Braxton announced the album would be released in early 2000, alongside a second single, "If You Don't Wanna Love Me". The album featured production from [[Missy Elliott]], [[Tim & Bob]], and [[Tricky Stewart]], but still peaked at number 127 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. When the album's second single failed to gain significant radio airplay, her label dropped her from their roster.
 
In 2001, Braxton's previously unreleased song "Try Me" appeared on the soundtrack album for the film ''[[Kingdom Come (2001 film)|Kingdom Come]]''. She also began to work alongside her sister [[Toni Braxton]] in a number of songs and music video cameos, including the video for "[[He Wasn't Man Enough]]." She performed, co-wrote and sang background vocals on songs for Toni's albums, ''[[The Heat (Toni Braxton album)|The Heat]]'' (2000), ''[[Snowflakes (album)|Snowflakes]]'' (2001), ''[[More Than a Woman (album)|More than a Woman]]'' (2002), ''[[Libra (Toni Braxton album)|Libra]]'' (2005) and ''[[Pulse (Toni Braxton album)|Pulse]]'' (2010). When her sister launched her [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] revue ''Toni Braxton: Revealed'', Braxton again sang backup until she was replaced by singer [[Sparkle (singer)|Sparkle]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

By 2004, Braxton was signed to [[Tommy Mottola]]'s reactivated [[Casablanca Records]] and began work on her second album. A "[[Grindin']]"-influenced single, "I'm Leaving," was released with a guest appearance from Bump J. alongside promotional remixes featuring [[Sheek Louch]], [[Styles P.]] and Ali Vegas.

In 2010, Braxton signed to [[Universal Records]], where she released a single "The Heart In Me" in July of that year which was included on the ''Adidas 2: The Music'' compilation. Her momentum with Universal would not rise to a satisfactory level to launch a second album. In January 2010, [[We TV]] confirmed that it had signed Braxton and her mother and sisters for a [[reality television]] series titled ''[[Braxton Family Values]]''.
