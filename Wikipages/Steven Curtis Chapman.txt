Chapman is also a vocal advocate for adoption along with his wife Mary Beth. They started a charity organization called Show Hope (formerly called Shaohannah's Hope) which mobilizes individuals and communities to care for orphans through its international orphan care work, as well as offering adoption grants to help put orphans in families. In 2009, Show Hope finished building Maria's Big House of Hope, a medical center in China that provides care to orphans with special needs.

Chapman was recognized in the Fall 2010 issue of ''Wood & Steel'' discussing the new Taylor 714 Signature Series guitar in honor of his youngest daughter Maria Sue.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.taylorguitars.com/guitars/limiteds/signature/StevenCurtisChapman/ |title=Steven Curtis Chapman Signature Model |date=October 12, 2010 |publisher=Taylor Guitars |access-date=March 6, 2012}}</ref> The guitar features the flower from Maria's picture and the word "SEE" on the 12th fret in Maria's handwriting. In 2003, Chapman starred in the Christian film ''[[Christmas Child]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001C3O6QS |title=The Christmas Child: William Moses, Steven Curtis Chapman, Megan Fellows, n/a: Movies & TV |access-date=March 6, 2012}}</ref>

== History ==
Steven Curtis Chapman was born to Judy and Herb Chapman in [[Paducah, Kentucky]], on November 21, 1962.<ref name="JFH">{{Cite web |url=http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/artists/StevenCurtisChapman.asp |title=Steven Curtis Chapman Discography |publisher=Jesus Freak Hideout |access-date=August 1, 2009}}</ref> Chapman's father is a guitar teacher in Paducah, and young Steven and older brother Herb Jr. grew up playing the guitar and singing.

Upon finishing high school, Chapman enrolled as a [[pre-medical|pre-med]] student at [[Georgetown College (Kentucky)|Georgetown College]] in [[Kentucky]]. After several semesters he transferred to [[Anderson University (Indiana)|Anderson College]] in [[Indiana]], but soon dropped out and went to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] to pursue a career in music. While in Nashville he briefly attended [[Belmont University]]. He began working a music show at [[Opryland USA]] while dedicating time to songwriting.<ref name="CMT bio">{{Cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/chapman_steven_curtis/bio.jhtml |title=Steven Curtis Chapman Bio |last=Brennan, Sandra (Allmusic)}}</ref><ref>Personal interview, April 1990</ref>

In the 1980s, Chapman wrote a song called "Built to Last", which was recorded by prominent [[gospel music|gospel]] group [[the Imperials]]. The strength of the song prompted him to be signed to a songwriting deal with [[Sparrow Records]], where he rose to prominence. As of 2007, artists like [[Sandi Patty]], [[Billy Dean]], [[Glen Campbell]], the [[Cathedral Quartet]] and [[Roger Whittaker]] have recorded Chapman's songs.<ref name="CMT bio" />

In 1987, Chapman released his first album, ''[[First Hand (album)|First Hand]]''. The album included the song "Weak Days", which peaked at No. 2 on the [[Contemporary Christian Music]] chart. In 1988, he followed with his second album, ''[[Real Life Conversations]]'', which earned him four more hits, including the No. 1 song "His Eyes". The song, which was co-written by James Isaac Elliott, earned the Contemporary Recorded Song of the Year award from the [[Gospel Music Association]] in 1989. That year, he also won a [[GMA Dove Award|GMA Award]] for Songwriter of the Year.

After that, Chapman followed with more albums like ''[[More to This Life]]'' and ''[[For the Sake of the Call (album)|For the Sake of the Call]]''. All of these albums featured several No. 1 singles and were awarded several GMA Awards. The latter also gave Chapman his first [[Grammy]] in the Best Pop Gospel Album category. These achievements strengthened his position in the [[Christian music]] scene.<ref name="CMT bio" />

In 1992, Chapman made a successful shift into a more [[mainstream audience]] with his album ''[[The Great Adventure (Steven Curtis Chapman album)|The Great Adventure]]''. The album garnered Chapman two more Grammys, for the album and for the title track video, again in gospel categories. After Sparrow Records was purchased by [[EMI]]/[[Liberty Records|Liberty]], they began to market the album to a broader audience, pushing it to gold status in 1993. The success of the album prompted Chapman to record one of his concerts and release it as ''[[The Live Adventure]]'', both as a video and a CD. This continuation won Chapman more GMA Awards, and also a new award from ''American Songwriter'' magazine for Songwriter and Artist of the Year.<ref name="CMT bio" />

Chapman continued to enjoy success with albums ''[[Heaven in the Real World]]'', ''[[Signs of Life (Steven Curtis Chapman album)|Signs of Life]]'', and ''[[Speechless (Steven Curtis Chapman album)|Speechless]]''. In 2000, he had his first (and so far only) voice role as [[Baloo]] in ''[[The Jungle Book Groove Party]]''. In 2001, with the release of ''[[Declaration (Steven Curtis Chapman album)|Declaration]]'', Chapman got more attention in the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. That album, along with 2003's ''[[All About Love (Steven Curtis Chapman album)|All About Love]]'', peaked in the Top 15. The follow-up, ''[[All Things New (Steven Curtis Chapman album)|All Things New]]'', peaked at No. 22.<ref name="CMT bio" />

Chapman has also released four Christmas albums, beginning with 1995's ''[[The Music of Christmas]]''. In 2003 he released ''[[Christmas Is All in the Heart]]'' exclusively through Hallmark Gold Crown Stores and in 2005, he released ''[[All I Really Want for Christmas]]'' and finally ''[[Joy (Steven Curtis Chapman album)|Joy]]'' was released in 2012.

In 2006, Chapman went on tour to several Asian countries. His website claims his concert for U.S. troops serving in South Korea was the first Christian concert ever performed for the troops in that country, and a concert in Shanghai, China, was "the first public performance by a Gospel recording artist event in the city open to China passport holders", and the third-largest concert in Shanghai that spring.<ref>[http://www.stevencurtischapman.com/news/default.aspx?id=332499 News Brief, July 26, 2006 (Retrieved August 19, 2006)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061112173623/http://www.stevencurtischapman.com/news/default.aspx?id=332499 |date=November 12, 2006 }}</ref> The tour also took the artist to Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Hong Kong, and Singapore. During the same period, his song "The Blessing" reached No. 1 on Thailand radio charts.

In 2007, Chapman co-headlined [[Newsong]]'s annual ''Winter Jam'' tour with [[Jeremy Camp]]. For the tour, he brought his sons' band, [[Colony House (band)|Colony House]], on tour to play as his backing band, along with longtime keyboardist Scott Sheriff. Chapman also released ''[[This Moment (album)|This Moment]]'', which included the hit singles "[[Cinderella (Steven Curtis Chapman song)|Cinderella]]" and "Yours", in October 2007. "Cinderella" was chosen for ''[[WOW Hits 2009]]''. On April 20, 2008, Chapman was awarded a star on Nashville's Walk of Fame for his contributions in Christian music. On November 3, 2009, Chapman released his seventeenth album ''[[Beauty Will Rise]]''. Many of the songs from this album are inspired by the death of his daughter, Maria Sue. He claims that the songs on the album are his "personal psalms". Chapman, his wife and two sons each got a tattoo of the flower that Maria drew before her untimely death.

In August 2012, Chapman announced his departure from [[Sparrow Records]] and his signature to [[Sony Music]]'s [[Provident Label Group]].<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/genre/christian-gospel/exclusive-steven-curtis-chapman-leaving-1007740952.story |title=Exclusive: Steven Curtis Chapman Leaving EMI's Sparrow For Sony's Provident Label |date=May 21, 2008 |magazine=Billboard |access-date=April 9, 2013 |archive-date=January 15, 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130115090853/http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/genre/christian-gospel/exclusive-steven-curtis-chapman-leaving-1007740952.story |url-status=dead }}</ref> He released his fourth Christmas album, ''JOY'', on October 16, 2012.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cmspin.com/newsmanager/anmviewer.asp?a=6711&z=26 |title=Steven Curtis Chapman Partners With Provident Music Group – CMSpin News Article |date=August 9, 2012 |publisher=Cmspin.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227115207/http://www.cmspin.com/newsmanager/anmviewer.asp?a=6711&z=26 |archive-date=February 27, 2014 |access-date=April 9, 2013}}</ref> ''Deep Roots'' was released exclusively through Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. on March 11, 2013.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://stevencurtischapman.com/news/news/cracker-barrel-old-country-store%C2%AE-reveals-steven-curtis-chapman%E2%80%99s-deep-roots-1011 |title=News: Cracker Barrel Old Country Store® Reveals Steven Curtis Chapman's Deep Roots &#124; Steven Curtis Chapman – New #1's Vol. 2 CD Now Available! |last=SCC Update |publisher=Steven Curtis Chapman |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326211423/http://stevencurtischapman.com/news/news/cracker-barrel-old-country-store%C2%AE-reveals-steven-curtis-chapman%E2%80%99s-deep-roots-1011 |archive-date=March 26, 2013 |access-date=April 9, 2013}}</ref> In September 2013, [[Reunion Records]] released Chapman's eighteenth album (the second with Reunion Records), ''[[The Glorious Unfolding]]'', which is also his first studio album in seven years that features completely original material.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnmusic/interviews/steven-curtis-chapman-glorious-unfolding-goodwyn.aspx |title=Senior Producer |last=Goodwyn |first=Hannah |date=January 22, 2014 |website=Interview with the Artist: Steven Curtis Chapman Looks to The Glorious Unfolding |publisher=The Christian Broadcasting Network, Inc. |access-date=February 23, 2014}}</ref> The album received critical acclaim, with many critics ranking it among his other chart-topping albums.

Will Franklin was pulling into the driveway of their house after he auditioned for a musical at school and Maria Sue was running to meet him so she could ask Will to put her on the monkey bars.

The family put Maria's ballet shoes, her favorite doll, letters from her brothers and sisters, and other personal mementos to Maria in her coffin. During the funeral service, Will kept Maria's security blanket around his shoulders. Maria Sue is buried in Williamson Memorial Gardens in [[Franklin, Tennessee]]. Chapman's subsequent album, ''[[Beauty Will Rise]]'', focuses on Maria's death and its aftermath. Chapman almost quit his singing career due to Maria's death and he nearly chose to never sing "Cinderella" again, but soon realized that Maria would have wanted him to continue singing and to honor her memory by singing "Cinderella". An investigation of Maria's death was performed by the Tennessee Highway Patrol. It was ruled as a tragic accident and no charges were filed. In November 2009, a year after Maria died, Chapman performed at a special concert at [[Harvest Christian Fellowship]]. [[Greg Laurie]], the pastor of Harvest, suffered the loss of his own son, Christopher Laurie, just months after Chapman's loss. Chapman performed several songs from ''Beauty Will Rise''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.christianpost.com/article/20091118/greg-laurie-steven-curtis-chapman-host-night-of-raw-honesty/ |title=Greg Laurie, Chapman Host Night of 'Raw Honesty', Christian News |date=November 18, 2009 |website=The Christian Post |access-date=March 6, 2012}}</ref>

In the late 1990s, Chapman became involved in youth violence prevention efforts following the 1997 [[Heath High School shooting]] at his alma mater in West Paducah, Kentucky.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.house.gov/ed_workforce/hearings/106th/ecyf/schviolence51899/chapman.pdf |title=Testimony of Steven Curtis Chapman to the Early Childhood, Youth and Families Subcommittee Committee on Education and the Workforce, U.S. House of Representatives, on May 18, 1999 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061123232256/http://www.house.gov/ed_workforce/hearings/106th/ecyf/schviolence51899/chapman.pdf |archive-date=November 23, 2006}}</ref> Chapman even dedicated a song, "With Hope", from his 1999 album, ''[[Speechless (Steven Curtis Chapman album)|Speechless]]'', to the families who lost someone in the shooting.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.connectionmagazine.org/archives_old/curtischapman.htm |title=Curtis Chapman |website=Connection Magazine}}</ref> In addition, he was asked to sing at the joint funeral held for the three victims. Chapman later gave a memorial concert and joined [[Charles Colson]] and others in creating a video designed to sensitize teenagers to the signs of serious violence planning among peers and to encourage them to report plans that are told to them.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://members.shaohannahshope.org/site/PageServer |title=Shaohannah's Hope |publisher=Members.shaohannahshope.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303013049/http://members.shaohannahshope.org/site/PageServer |archive-date=March 3, 2012 |access-date=March 6, 2012}}</ref>

In 2009, Show Hope finished building Maria's Big House of Hope, a medical care center in China that provides holistic care to orphans with special needs. Maria's Big House of Hope is also dedicated to the memory of the late Maria Sue Chunxi Chapman. Also in 2009, Chapman and his wife received the Children's Champion Award from the charitable organization [[Children's Hunger Fund]] for their work with Show Hope.

In September 2011, Chapman and his wife were awarded the Congressional [[Angels in Adoption]] award by the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute (CCAI) in Washington, D.C.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ccainstitute.org/membersonly/members/angelawardrecipients06.pdf |title=National Angels Category, Past Angels in Adoption Award Recipients, 1999–2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326215506/http://www.ccainstitute.org/membersonly/members/angelawardrecipients06.pdf |archive-date=March 26, 2009}}</ref>

Chapman also has promoted the international charity [[World Vision]] for at least a decade, serving as spokesman for Project Restore, its program serving the U.S. [[Gulf Coast]] region in recovery from [[Hurricane Katrina]], in cooperation with the Gospel Music Association. He has also occasionally traveled to Uganda to help with the problem of street children, and to help [[orphans]] and [[adoption]] organizations. He has played at local churches, including KPC ([[Kampala Pentecostal Church]]) in [[Kampala]].

In 2020, Chapman was a featured guest at [[Keith & Kristyn Getty]]'s Sing! Global 2020 Conference designed to train music leaders and instill the importance of solid doctrine and Gospel saturated lyrics in Christian music.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Steven Curtis Chapman - Sing!
