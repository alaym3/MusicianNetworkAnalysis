=== 1948–1962: Childhood ===
José Rómulo Sosa Ortiz was born on 17 February 1948 in Clavería, [[Azcapotzalco]], [[Mexico City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.infobae.com/america/entretenimiento/2019/09/28/jose-jose-una-vida-llena-de-contrastes/|title=José José una vida llena de contrastes|trans-title=José José a life full of contrasts|website=infobae|language=es|date=28 September 2019|access-date=29 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telemundo31.com/noticias/mexico/termina-sepelio-de-jose-jose-pero-el-homenaje-sigue-a-finales-de-octubre-en-el-zocalo-562661601.html|title=Termina el sepelio de José José, pero el homenaje sigue|trans-title=The funeral of José José ends, but the tribute continues|website=Telemundo 31|language=es|date=9 October 2019|access-date=10 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191010032747/https://www.telemundo31.com/noticias/mexico/termina-sepelio-de-jose-jose-pero-el-homenaje-sigue-a-finales-de-octubre-en-el-zocalo-562661601.html|archive-date=10 October 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buenamusica.com/jose-jose/biografia|title=Biografía de José José|trans-title=José José Biography|website=Buena Musica|language=es|access-date=10 October 2019}}</ref> His father, [[José Sosa Esquivel]], was an [[tenor|operatic tenor]] (tenor comprimario) and his mother, Margarita Ortiz, was a classical pianist.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pino |first1=Carolina Amézquita |title=Quién es quién en la familia de José José |url=https://peopleenespanol.com/celebridades/quien-es-quien-en-la-familia-de-jose-jose/? |website=People en Español |access-date=29 September 2019 |date=12 November 2018}}</ref> When José showed interest in singing, they tried to discourage him claiming that it was too difficult to be successful in show business. In that time, his reportedly alcoholic father abandoned the family forcing José to work to help his mother and younger brother.

=== 1963–1969: Beginnings as singer ===
At the age of fifteen, his mother gave him his first piano. Besides working in his teens, he learned to play [[guitar]] and sang in the [[Catholic Church|church]] and in [[serenades]] along with his neighborhood friends for extra money.

In 1967, at the age of 19, José formed Los Peg, a Mexican band of [[bossa nova]]/[[jazz]].<ref name="Peg">{{cite web|url=https://estroncio90.typepad.com/blog/2011/06/los-peg.html|title=Los PEG|work=estroncio90|date=21 June 2011|accessdate=21 September 2021|language=es}}</ref> Although they made several recordings as a group, their songs were not successful.<ref name="Peg"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Ruiz |first1=Gerardo |title=José José: réquiem por el 'Príncipe' triste |url=https://www.univision.com/famosos/jose-jose-requiem-por-el-principe-triste |website=Univision |access-date=2 October 2019 |language=es |date=28 September 2019}}</ref> In 1965, under the name of "Pepe Sosa", pursuing a solo career encouraged by his mother, he recorded the singles "Ma vie" and "El Mundo" without success. He made a breakthrough with his artistic career when he was invited to perform a song for a friend's sister on her birthday. His friend's sister was the executive secretary for the managing director of [[Orfeón (Mexican record label)|Orfeón Records]]. He joined his first name "José" with his father's first name - also José - who died of alcoholism.<ref name="bbobituary">{{cite web |last1=Cobo |first1=Leila |title=Jose Jose, Mexican Prince of Song, Dead at 71 |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8531659/jose-jose-obituary-mexican-prince-of-song-dead-at-71 |website=Billboard  |access-date=2 October 2019 |date=28 September 2019}}</ref> He signed a contract with [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] and recorded his first album: ''[[Cuidado|José José]]'' (also known as ''Cuidado''). The album featured songs by [[Rubén Fuentes]] and [[Armando Manzanero]]. It was arranged by his former teacher Mario Patrón, who was considered the best jazz musician of Mexico, and employed Brazilian percussionist [[Mayuto Correa]], who was in Mexico City playing with bossa nova stars João Gilberto, [[Carlos Lira]], [[Leny Andrade]] and [[Tamba Trio]]. The album's sound is a combination of [[boleros]] and romantic ballads with a jazz and bossa nova influence. The quality of his debut album garnered praise from critics but did not achieve much popular success.<ref name="selecciones.com.mx">{{Cite web|url=http://www.selecciones.com.mx/content/21588/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531035439/http://www.selecciones.com.mx/content/21588|url-status=dead|title=Interview with ''Selecciones''|archive-date=31 May 2009}}</ref>

Although José José finished in third place, his performance helped launch his music career to a wider audience.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Baustista |first1=Berenice |title=Muere José José, el "Príncipe de la Canción" |url=https://www.chron.com/espanol/news/article/Muere-Jose-Jose-el-Pr-ncipe-de-la-14475765.php |access-date=2 October 2019 |work=Houston Chronicle |date=28 September 2019 |language=es}}</ref>

In 1973, [[Frank Sinatra]] listened to José's music at [[Reprise Records]] and invited him to record a duet and a full album under Sinatra's label.

By the early 1990s, José's vocals began to deteriorate. It worsened over time and became evident in his live performances. His excessive drinking and unceasing activity of his career caused his voice to falter.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/59886399.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Sep+12,+1988&author=VICTOR+VALLE&pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&edition=&startpage=5&desc=Jose+Jose+Is+Affable+but+Passe+in+Greek+Show | first=Victor | last=Valle | title=Jose Jose Is Affable but Passe in Greek Show | date=12 September 1988}}</ref>

In August 1993, to commemorate the 30th anniversary of José's career, [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] hosted a tribute in the city of [[Puerto Vallarta]]. It was called ''30 Años de ser el Príncipe'' (30 years of being the Prince). The tribute included some of the most prestigious artists of Spanish music such as [[Rocío Dúrcal]], [[Camilo Sesto]], Armando Manzanero, Marco Antonio Muñiz and [[Raúl di Blasio]]. The tribute coincided with his recent divorce, a serious relapse into alcoholism and a significant loss of vocal abilities. He appeared to be in poor physical shape, too thin and lacking energy. Camilo Sesto even took a break in the middle of the presentation to speak words of encouragement. The album was not released until 1994.<ref>{{cite news |title=Siguen Homenajes a José José |url=https://caracol.com.co/radio/1998/07/29/nacional/0901692000_018739.html |access-date=3 October 2019 |work=Caracol Radio |date=29 July 1998 |language=es}}</ref> At that time, José suffered the worst stage of alcoholism of his life. During 1993, he retired from the stage and went into rehab. Upon completion of his rehabilitation, he started seasons in places like the famous "Teatro Blanquita" of Mexico City, and the Gibson Amphitheatre in Los Angeles, among others.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-10-11/entertainment/ca-48854_1_jose-jose|work=Los Angeles Times|first=Enrique|last=Lopetegui|date=11 October 1994|title=Pop Music Review : Jose Jose Gets a Hero's Welcome}}</ref>

=== 2000–2012: Vocal problems, TV and Sony BMG concept albums ===
In 2001, with a deteriorating voice he recorded ''Tenampa''. It was his first studio album with [[mariachi]] and the last one of his career. It was written and produced completely by [[Juan Gabriel]]. It received poor reviews and sold only about 500,000 units.<ref>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r551304|pure_url=yes}}</ref> After that, he retired from recording full-length albums. His vocal problems worsened, affecting not only his ability to sing, but also to speak. In 2003, BMG released a collection of three albums entitled ''El Principe Con Trio'' with some of his greatest hits recorded between 1969 and 1983, separated from the original accompaniment, remastered and accompanied by the guitar [[Trio (music)|trio]] "Los Tres Caballeros", transforming them into boleros.<ref name="allmusic"/>

In 2008, José recorded an emotive song called "Volver a creer" ("Believe Again") with Greek composer [[Yanni]]. The song is included on the album ''[[Yanni Voices]]''. Yanni stated that he wanted to "help a true legend to fulfill his dream, to sing again".<ref>{{cite web|author=Por El Universal |url=http://www.zocalo.com.mx/seccion/articulo/pianista-internacional-yanni-apoya-a-jose-jose |title=Pianista internacional Yanni apoya a José José [Música&#93; – 15/11/2008 &#124; Periódico Zócalo |publisher=Zocalo.com.mx |date=15 November 2008 |access-date=14 October 2012}}</ref> José José was invited by Yanni to sing their song live on Yanni's tour in Mexico.

== Personal life ==
=== Relationships, marriages and family ===
In 1970 he started a relationship with TV hostess, actress, and model Ana Elena Noreña, known in show business as [[Anel (actress)|Anel]]. That year they split and he married Natalia "Kiki" Herrera Calles, a socialite 20 years older. He separated from Herrera and returned to Anel shortly after. He divorced Herrera in 1975<ref name="selecciones.com.mx"/> and married Anel in 1976. They had two children: their first-born José Francisco (known as José Joél) who was born in 1975, and their daughter Marysol Estrella, born in 1982.<ref name="selecciones.com.mx"/> In 1991 he divorced Anel.<ref name="Selecciones"/> Four years later, he married Sara "Sarita" Salazar, his third wife.

=== Alcoholism ===
José said that he started drinking at the age of fifteen, when his father (an alcoholic) left home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.informador.com.mx/entretenimiento/2008/60713/6/el-cantante-presenta-libro-en-la-fil-jose-jose-sin-filtros.htm |title=El cantante presenta libro en la FIL, José José, sin filtros :: El Informador |publisher=Informador.com.mx |access-date=14 October 2012}}</ref> As a result of his alcoholism, he developed a [[cocaine]] habit.

He stated that his addiction was because he "was frail, weak, innocent, ignorant, weak-willed and did not know how to say no".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diariolasamericas.com/news.php?nid=65038 |title=¿Por qué José José cayó en el alcoholismo? |publisher=Diario Las Americas |date=2 August 2010 |access-date=14 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110040053/http://www.diariolasamericas.com/news.php?nid=65038 |archive-date=10 January 2016 }}</ref> In the early 1970s, after the success of "El Triste" and missing a collaboration with [[Frank Sinatra]], he fell into depression and alcoholism, but with help of his friends and family he managed to stop drinking for a while. His ongoing battle against alcoholism continued during the 1970s and 1980s. He attended [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]] meetings and stopped drinking for periods of time, but fell steadily back into the addiction. After his divorce from Anel in 1991 he reached his lowest point, reportedly declaring that he wanted to die drinking. With the help of his friends, family and fellow artists, he decided to go to rehab. He went to the [[Hazelden]] clinic in [[Minnesota]] for rehab and remained a sober recovering alcoholic.<ref name="selecciones.com.mx"/>

===Health issues===
José José suffered from a severe case of [[pneumonia]] in 1972 and his [[thoracic diaphragm]] was [[paralyzed]]. The disease almost ended his career. He recovered after months of therapy involving breathing exercises. One of his lungs was permanently damaged.<ref name="selecciones.com.mx"/> In 1987, he underwent an operation at the [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] to remove [[Vocal fold nodule|nodes in his vocal fold]] as a consequence of the excessive use of [[cortisone]] before singing, alcohol use, and the lack of rest after many of his performances. José would suffer dire consequences from his problem with alcoholism, as his health faltered dearly during the 1990s. He developed [[diabetes]].{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

The effects of alcoholism, the abuse of cortisone, and his [[hiatus hernia]] not only affected his ability to sing but to talk, as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.univision.com/content/content.jhtml?chid=6&schid=1363&secid=1408&pagenum=1 |title=Confesiones de un príncipe – Univision TV |publisher=Univision.com |date=27 September 2007 |access-date=14 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606070729/http://www.univision.com/content/content.jhtml?chid=6&schid=1363&secid=1408&cid=1300012&pagenum=1 |archive-date=6 June 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> In 2007, he suffered from [[Bell's palsy]].

===Financial problems===
In later years, José made his financial problems public. Despite being one of the most recognized Latin artists for decades, his alcoholism caused him serious monetary loss. His career declined when he lost his vocal ability, stopping income from live performances. He claimed that during his career he was constantly defrauded by people close to him, including his former wife Anel and her brother.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.peopleenespanol.com/pespanol/articles/0,22490,1181091,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220172652/http://www.peopleenespanol.com/pespanol/articles/0,22490,1181091,00.html|url-status=dead|title=&#124; People en Español|archive-date=20 February 2010}}</ref> In November 2008, his wife suffered a [[cerebral hemorrhage|cerebral haemorrhage]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peopleenespanol.com/pespanol/articles/0,22490,1860412,00.html |title=La esposa de José José sufre derrame cerebral |publisher=PeopleenEspanol.com |access-date=14 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929143642/http://www.peopleenespanol.com/pespanol/articles/0,22490,1860412,00.html |archive-date=29 September 2011  }}</ref> José stated that the medical bills nearly caused him to go bankrupt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.terra.com.mx/articulo.aspx?articuloId=777628 |title=Busca José José salir a flote de deudas – Famosos – Gente E |publisher=Terra |access-date=14 October 2012}}</ref> He told ''[[TV Notas]]'' magazine that he and his family lived "day to day" and in 2014, he sold his five-million-dollar house in [[Coral Gables, Florida]], and moved to an apartment in Miami.

José grew up listening to [[traditional pop music]], [[rock and roll]], [[jazz]], [[swing music|swing]], and [[big band]]. He listened to performers such as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Johnny Mathis]] and such popular Mexican composers as [[Consuelo Velázquez]] and [[María Grever]]. He was later inspired by vocalist [[Barbra Streisand]], whom he considered an influence.<ref name="josejose.us"/> The son of an operatic tenor and a pianist, he grew up listening to composers such as [[Chopin]] and [[Mozart]], but never got the chance to play classical music. In his teens, José learned to play music from top Mexican jazz players and is recognized for playing several instruments, such as the piano, bass, guitar and double bass. Because of his [[musical phrasing|phrasing]] ability, he was once described as "a singer who sings as a musician". His musical preferences were classical musicians such as [[Ravel]], [[Debussy]] and [[Musorgsky]], jazz, and bossa nova.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diariolibre.com/noticias_det.php?id=187441|title=José José: "Soy millonario en amigos"|publisher=DiarioLibre.com|access-date=14 October 2012}}</ref>

===Vocals===
According to his autobiography, ''Ésta es mi vida'', vocal coach Guido Picco described José José as a [[Tenore di grazia|light lyric tenor]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Light Lyric Tenor|url=http://operalab.org/archives/1841|access-date=5 February 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507065159/http://operalab.org/archives/1841|archive-date=7 May 2011}}</ref> José worked for periods with coach [[Seth Riggs]], who later highlighted his vocal abilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archivo.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/720794.html|title=Jackson, uno de los artistas más completos|website=archivo.eluniversal.com.mx|access-date=3 October 2019|date=2 November 2010}}</ref> Over time, his voice and vocal style changed noticeably, being his prime the early 1970s. Inheriting the singing qualities of his father, he was able to reach high and low notes easily with a practically flawless intonation.<ref name="quintacolumna.com.mx">{{cite web|url=http://www.quintacolumna.com.mx/2009/febrero/columnistas/colu_personajes_260209.html|title=La Quinta Columna – Columnistas – personajes|publisher=Quintacolumna.com.mx|access-date=14 October 2012}}</ref> His live performance of "El Triste" in 1970 has been widely praised by many critics for its technique and intensity.

After recording the song "El Triste" for the 2010 album ''[[Iconos]]'', singer [[Marc Anthony]] said, "once you start to sing it you realize the magnitude, of that spectacular voice and special phrasing of José José and his incredible way to perform".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://elperiodiquito.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=8335|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308082345/http://elperiodiquito.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=8335|url-status=dead|title=Excerpt from elperiodiquito.com|archive-date=8 March 2012}}</ref> On the [[VH1 (Latin America)|Latin VH1]] show ''Las 100 grandiosas canciones de los 1980s en español'' (''The 100 Greatest Spanish Songs of the 1980s''), singer [[Diego Verdaguer]] said: "If today he could sing, he would be the greatest of Latin America."  In a 2018 interview, singer [[Lupita D'Alessio]] stated "[José] is an icon, the master, the creator of phrasing, he's got a way of phrasing that there will not be another, for me, he is the greatest singer ever, with the pardon of [[Luis Miguel]]".
