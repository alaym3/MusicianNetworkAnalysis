'''Monica Zetterlund''' (born '''Eva Monica Nilsson'''; 20 September 1937&nbsp;– 12 May 2005) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[jazz]] [[Singing|singer]] and [[Actor|actress]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Bergh|first=Johs|title=Monica Zetterlund|date=2020-12-07|url=http://snl.no/Monica_Zetterlund|work=Store norske leksikon|language=nb|access-date=2021-05-02}}</ref> Through her lifetime, she  starred in over 10 Swedish film productions and recorded over 20 studio albums. She gained international fame through her collaborative album with [[Bill Evans]], ''[[Waltz for Debby (1964 album)|Waltz for Debby]].''

==Career==
===Singer===
Zetterlund began by learning the classic jazz songs from radio and records, initially not knowing the language and what they sang about in English. Her hit songs included "Sakta vi gå genom stan" (Swedish cover of "[[Walkin' My Baby Back Home (song)|Walking My Baby Back Home]]"; in Swedish a tribute to [[Stockholm]] town), "[[Visa från Utanmyra]]", "Sista jäntan", "Trubbel", "Gröna små äpplen" ("[[Little Green Apples]]"), "Monicas vals" ("[[Waltz for Debby (song)|Waltz for Debby]]"), "Stick iväg, Jack!" ("[[Hit the Road Jack]]"), "Att angöra en brygga", "Var blev ni av", "Måne över Stureplan" (cover of [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]'s "Moon Over Bourbon Street") and "Under vinrankan!", among many, many others.

She also interpreted the works of such Swedish singer-songwriters as [[Evert Taube]], [[Olle Adolphson]] and [[Povel Ramel]], as well as international jazz musicians/songwriters. She worked with leading American players including [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Bill Evans]], [[Stan Getz]], [[Steve Kuhn]] and [[Quincy Jones]], and in the [[Scandinavia]]n jazz world with people like [[Georg Riedel (Swedish jazz musician)|Georg Riedel]], [[Egil Johansen (musician)|Egil Johansen]], [[Arne Domnérus]], [[Svend Asmussen]] and [[Jan Johansson (jazz musician)|Jan Johansson]].<ref name="NYT2005">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/14/arts/music/14zetterlund.html|title=Monica Zetterlund, 67, Singer and Actress, Dies|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=14 May 2005}}</ref>

In 1964, she recorded the jazz album ''[[Waltz for Debby (1964 album)|Waltz for Debby]]'', featuring [[Bill Evans]], a record she herself described as "the best I've done"{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} and was the most proud of. Her professional skill was amply demonstrated in this album in performing the challenging Harold Arlen song, "So Long, Big Time".

Her long career also included the song "[[En gång i Stockholm]]" ("Once Upon a Time in Stockholm"); a jazz ballad with which she represented Sweden in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1963|1963 Eurovision Song Contest]]. She finished last, however (mainly because the song genre was not suitable for the competition){{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} and scored ''nul points'', but remained successful in Sweden.

===Actor===
Her collaboration with the comic duo [[Hasse & Tage]] (in the 1960s and 1970s) eventually led to a stage career in revues and films. Memorable are her parts in the films ''[[Att angöra en brygga]]'' and ''[[Äppelkriget]]'', with her most memorable role being in [[Jan Troell]]'s ''Utvandrarna'' (aka ''[[The Emigrants (film)|The Emigrants]]''; with [[Liv Ullmann]] and [[Max von Sydow]] in the leads) as Ulrika, a former prostitute who together with her teenage daughter Elin (portrayed by Zetterlund's daughter, Eva Lena Zetterlund) join the main characters in their emigration to America in the 1850s, a role for which Zetterlund received a [[Guldbagge Award]] for Best Supporting Actress.<ref name="8thGuldbagge">{{cite web |url=http://www.sfi.se/en-GB/Swedish-film-database/Item/?type=MOVIE&itemid=4883&iv=Awards |title=Äppelkriget (1971) |publisher=Swedish Film Institute |date=2 March 2014}}</ref> She appeared in more than 20 films and television series.<ref name="NYT2005" />

==Health and death==
She suffered from severe [[scoliosis]] which began after a childhood accident, and as a result was forced to retire from performing in 1999.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

On 12 May 2005, she died following an accidental fire in her [[apartment]] in [[Stockholm]], probably due to her habit of smoking in bed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article10595268.ab|title=Sångerskan Monica Zetterlund död}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.expressen.se/noje/monica-zetterlund-dog-isolerad-i-sitt-hem/|title=Monica Zetterlund dog isolerad i sitt hem}}</ref>
