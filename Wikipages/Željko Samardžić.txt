'''Željko Samardžić''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]]: Жељко Самарџић; born 3 October 1955) is a [[Folk music|folk]] singer from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], popular throughout the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslav republics]].<ref>[http://www.blic.rs/Zabava/Vesti/234424/Zeljko-Samardzic--8-marta-u-Areni Željko Samardžić 8. marta u "Areni"]</ref> Born in [[Mostar]], he achieved fame when he moved to [[Belgrade]] as a result of the [[Bosnian War]].

==Biography==
Samardžić was born in [[Mostar]], at the time part of [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|PR Bosnia and Herzegovina]], in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|FPR Yugoslavia]]. His father Milivoje was an ethnic [[Montenegrins|Montenegrin]], and his mother Nada was a [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Herzegovinian Croat]] from the [[Ilići]] suburb of Mostar. Samardžić's father was a [[Yugoslav People's Army]] officer, which meant that the family had to move around a lot. After spending the first seven years of his life in Mostar, young Željko lived and attended school in [[Nikšić]], [[Igalo]] and [[Zadar]] before eventually returning to Mostar during his teenage years.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2010-05-14|title=Rođen sam pod sretnom zvijezdom|url=https://www.gloria.hr/gl/arhiva/roden-sam-pod-sretnom-zvijezdom-5072885|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2021-01-18|website=Gloria|language=hr-hr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Željko Samardžić - Žiri - Nikad nije kasno|url=https://grand.online/nikad-nije-kasno/jury/zeljko-samardzic|access-date=2021-01-18|website=Grand Online|language=sr}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2017-06-08|title=Željko Samardžić: Otac mi je Crnogorac, a majka Hrvatica... kad sam u Međugorju za nju zapalim svijeću|url=https://www.grude.com/clanak/?i=27755&zeljko-samardzic-otac-mi-je-crnogorac-a-majka-hrvatica-kad-sam-u-medjugorju-za-nju-zapalim-svijecu|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2021-01-18|website=Grude.com|language=hr}}</ref>

He first started singing during high school, and soon became known around Mostar as a good [[Kemal Monteno]] impersonator. Samardžić's musical activity during this period was essentially little more than a hobby as he did not put out any official releases and mostly sang in [[kafana]]s and restaurants in addition to competing in the occasional obscure festival. The closest he came to wide mainstream success was a schlager "Moja Marija je drugačija" that became a hit in Bosnia during the 1970s after he performed it at ''Prvi aplauz'' festival in [[Banja Luka]], but he mostly earned his living running a café in Mostar, located in proximity of the famous [[Stari most|Old Bridge]].

When the [[Bosnian War]] broke out in 1992, Željko was wounded sitting in his apartment while chaotic fighting was raging outside. A stray bullet entered his leg and exited his hip. After much trouble, along with his wife and their daughter, he managed to flee the city through the Croat-controlled western part of [[Herzegovina]] and eventually reach [[Serbia]] after going through [[Croatia]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Hungary]]. Once in Serbia, they lived in the [[Belgrade]] suburb of [[Borča]] and Samardžić soon started getting low-paying gigs in various [[discothèques]] and cafés, building up a fairly devoted [[niche market|niche]] audience. Almost 40 years old at this point, his big break came unexpectedly when some businessmen who enjoyed his nightclub performances brought him to the elite club Ambassador and also financed him with [[Deutsche Mark|DM]]30,000 to record an album with [[Marina Tucaković]] and Aleksandar "Futa" Radulović. In 1995, he also appeared at the ''[[Pjesma Mediterana]]'' festival in [[Budva]], where he left a great impression singing "Sipajte mi još jedan viski", which further opened the doors to show business.

==Personal life==
He is married to Maja Džaferović, an ethnic [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]], with whom he has daughters Sanja, Danijela and Minja, and grandchildren Luka, Aleksa and Nina.<ref>{{Cite web|last=V.
