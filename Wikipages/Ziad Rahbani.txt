'''Ziad Rahbani'''{{efn|Also written as '''Ziyad al-Rahbany'''}} ({{lang-ar|زياد الرحباني}}, born 1956) is a Lebanese [[composer]], [[pianist]], [[playwright]], and [[political commentator]]. He is the son of [[Fairouz]], one of Lebanon and the Arab world's most famous singers, and [[Assi Rahbani]], one of the founders of modern Arab music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-04-14-ca-1767-story.html|title=Rahbani's 'Oriental Jazz' Is Rooted in Lebanon's Struggle but Scorned by Traditional Arabs|date=April 14, 1988|website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

His compositions are well known throughout the [[Arab world]]. He became by far the most influential Lebanese artist during the [[Lebanese Civil War|civil war]]. Many of his musicals satirize Lebanese politics both during and after the [[Lebanese civil war|Lebanese Civil War]], and are often strongly critical of the traditional political establishment.

==Personal life==
Ziad Rahbani is the son of the Lebanese composer [[Rahbani brothers|Assi Rahbani]] and [[Nouhad Haddad]], the Lebanese female singer known as [[Fairuz]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nogomistars.com/biography.asp?ID=343|title=Ziad biography|work=Nogomi Stars}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Fairouz our ambassador to the Stars|url=http://almashriq.hiof.no/lebanon/700/780/fairuz/|work=Al Mashriq|access-date=6 September 2013}}</ref>

Rahbani was married to Dalal Karam, with whom he has a boy named "Assi" but he was later found out not to be his biological son. Their relationship later ended in divorce, prompting Karam to write a series of articles for the gossip magazine ''Ashabaka'' about their marriage. Rahbani composed a number of songs about their relationship, including "Marba el Dalal"<ref>{{cite web|title=Marba el Dalal|url=https://www.amazon.com/mp3-downloads/dp/B003DNMW2U|work=Amazon|access-date=6 September 2013}}</ref> and "Bisaraha".<ref>{{cite web|title=Bisaraha|url=https://www.amazon.com/Bisaraha/dp/B0014SS0BS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1378452091&s=dmusic&sr=1-1|work=Amazon|access-date=6 September 2013}}</ref>

On Friday April 3, 2009, the Lebanese press reported that Rahbani filed a lawsuit with the Lebanese courts, asking to disown his son, Assi Rahbani Jr., and stripping him of the Rahbani name on all official records, and voiding any legal obligation towards him as a father, after DNA tests proved that Assi Jr. is not his son.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/life-style/people/paternity-scandal-rocks-rahbani-family-1.3949|title=Paternity scandal rocks Rahbani family|author=Patricia Khoder|work=Gulf News|date=2009-04-19}}</ref> Rahbani has also had a well-publicized relationship with actress [[Carmen Lebbos]], which lasted for 15 years before the couple agreed to separate. 
[[File:Fairuz and her son Ziad Rahbani - 1973.jpg|thumb|right|Ziad Rahbani and his mother Fairuz]]
Rahbani has a long-standing relationship with Lebanese leftist movements, and is a self-declared [[communist]]. Furthermore, in an interview with the journalist Ghassan Bin-Jiddu, Rahbani stated that the bloodbath massacres in the Palestinian camp Tall a-Za’tar by extreme-rightist Christian militias in 1976 was the main reason that drove him to leave to West Beirut. Notwithstanding, he also expressed his support to the Lebanese resistance and its project in the face of "the Israeli occupation and its Zionist Apartheid regime".<ref>{{cite web|title=Ziad Rahbani: The Artist Whose Biography Tells Lebanon’s History|url=https://chronicle.fanack.com/lebanon/faces/ziad-rahbani/|website=Fanack.com|access-date=22 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fouTNTaIdTY|title=Ziad Rahbani - communisme - athéisme|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref> Coming from a Christian family, his politics and viewpoints have meant that he has been at odds with some of his extreme-right teenage surroundings.<ref>{{cite news|last=As'ad|first=AbuKhalil|author-link=As'ad AbuKhalil|title=The Cult of Ziad Rahbani|url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/12871|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402152321/http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/12871|url-status=dead|archive-date=2015-04-02|access-date=6 September 2013|newspaper=al-akhbar|date=2012-10-08}}</ref> During the Lebanese civil war, Rahbani resided in the religiously mixed, West Beirut suburbs.

==Career==
Rahbani's first known artistic work was "Sadiqi Allah" (My Friend God), a collection of writings between the years 1967 and 1968 when he was in his teens. In 1973, at age 17, Rahbani composed his first music for Fairuz, his mother. Assi Rahbani, his father, was hospitalized and his mother Fairuz was to play the leading role in ''Al Mahatta'' by the [[Rahbani brothers]]. [[Mansour Rahbani]], his uncle, who had written the lyrics of a song about Assi Rahbani's forced absence, gave Ziad Rahbani the task of composing its music. The song "Saalouni El Nass" (People Asked Me)<ref>{{cite web|title=Sa'alouni El Nas|url=https://www.amazon.com/Saalouni-El-Nas/dp/B003I0T9PQ|work=Amazon|access-date=9 September 2013}}</ref> gained Rahbani recognition in the music world.

As an actor, besides appearing in his own plays, Rahbani starred in [[Randa Chahal Sabag|Randa Chahal Sabbagh]]'s 2003 film [[The Kite (2003 film)|The Kite]].
