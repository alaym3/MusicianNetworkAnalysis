==Life and career==
Reekado Banks is the last child of a music-loving family. His father is a pastor from [[Ondo State]] and his mother is a caterer.<ref name="Vanguard Nigeria">{{cite web|last1=Vanguard|first1=Entertainment|title=I once worked as a bricklayer to survive -Reekado Banks|url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/04/i-once-worked-as-a-bricklayer-to-survive-reekado-banks/|publisher=Vanguard Nigeria|access-date=23 April 2015|date=23 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150422025738/http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/04/i-once-worked-as-a-bricklayer-to-survive-reekado-banks/|archive-date=22 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Moreover, his elder brother is a producer and his elder sister is a gospel singer. He grew up in a disciplinarian setting due to both of his parents being pastors. He completed his secondary school at the age of 14, and started recording his first set of songs in 2008. His elder brother produced all of his earlier songs and tutored him on the rudiments of singing, writing and producing. He derived the stage name Reekado Banks by combining the meanings of the two names; the former part of his stage name translates to "strong ruler", while the latter part loosely translates to "wealth".<ref name="National Mirror">{{cite web|last1=Oluwadahunsi|first1=Olawale|title=I do all genres of music -Reekado Banks|url=http://nationalmirroronline.net/new/i-do-all-genres-of-music-reekado-banks/|publisher=National Mirror|access-date=4 April 2015|date=12 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318094200/http://nationalmirroronline.net/new/i-do-all-genres-of-music-reekado-banks/|archive-date=18 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2014, Reekado Banks graduated from the [[University of Lagos]] with a degree in history and strategic study.<ref name="The Nation">{{cite web|last1=Damilare|first1=Famuyiwa|title=REEKADO BANKS:I like to do crazy stuffs and music makes it easy|url=http://thenationonlineng.net/new/reekado-banksi-like-crazy-stuffs-music-makes-easy/|publisher=The Nation|access-date=14 April 2015|date=28 December 2014}}</ref> He has cited [[Don Jazzy]], [[2face Idibia]], [[DJ Jimmy Jatt]], [[Olamide]] and [[M.I Abaga|M.I]] as his key musical inspirations.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Jayne Augoye |author2=Peter Okeugo |title=I can’t be distracted by ladies —Reekado Banks |url=http://www.punchng.com/spice/i-cant-be-distracted-by-ladies-reekado-banks/ |publisher=Punch |access-date=14 April 2015 |date=18 January 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144432/http://www.punchng.com/spice/i-cant-be-distracted-by-ladies-reekado-banks/ |archivedate=April 22, 2015 }}</ref>

===Mavin Records deal and artistry===
His record deal with Mavin Records came as a result of his brother submitting some of his songs to the label in an online talent search. Reekado Banks got signed to Mavin Records after his entries were selected from over 5000 entries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reekado Banks Bio|url=https://mavinrecords.com/M/reekado_banks/|publisher=Mavin Records|access-date=4 April 2015|date=12 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401021352/http://mavinrecords.com/M/reekado_banks/|archive-date=1 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> In an interview with the ''[[National Mirror]]'', he said his brother submitted his songs and communicated with the label on his behalf without his initial consent. Reekado Banks also told the ''National Mirror'' he's a versatile artist who makes music with the thought that humans are different and have different tastes.<ref name="National Mirror"/>

===2014–present: Singles and Mavin Records departure===
Reekado Banks premiered the single "Turn It Up" on 21 February 2014, which coincided with the day he signed with Mavin Records. The song features [[Tiwa Savage]] and was released as his first official single under Mavin Records.<ref>{{cite web|title=Another Mavin Activated! Don Jazzy presents Reekardo Banks Feat.

On 13 February 2015, he released the Don Jazzy-produced song "Katapot". It was alleged to be a diss track towards [[D'banj]] and [[Wande Coal]]. In February 2015, Don Jazzy debunked the allegations in a series of tweets.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Abimboye|first1=Micheal|title=Don Jazzy says Reekado Banks’ Kataput not dis at Dbanj|url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/arts-entertainment/177249-don-jazzy-says-reekado-banks-kataput-not-dis-at-dbanj.html|publisher=Premium Times|access-date=14 April 2015|date=20 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504052308/http://www.premiumtimesng.com/arts-entertainment/177249-don-jazzy-says-reekado-banks-kataput-not-dis-at-dbanj.html|archive-date=4 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> While speaking to ''[[Vanguard (Nigeria)|Vanguard]]'' newspaper, Reekado Banks said he created "Katapot" for his fans.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ige|first1=Tofarati|title=I have three things no other artiste has — Reekado Banks|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/03/i-have-three-things-no-other-artiste-has-reekado-banks/|publisher=Vanguard|access-date=14 April 2015|date=22 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412135546/http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/03/i-have-three-things-no-other-artiste-has-reekado-banks/|archive-date=12 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

In July 2015, Nigerian telecommunications company [[Globacom]] signed Reekado Banks to an endorsement deal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Glo signs on 28 ambassadors; Mama G, Wizkid, AY, P-Square , Korede Bello top list|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/07/glo-signs-on-28-ambassadors-mama-g-wizkid-ay-p-square-korede-bello-top-list/|publisher=Vanguard|access-date=9 May 2016|date=1 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501101021/http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/07/glo-signs-on-28-ambassadors-mama-g-wizkid-ay-p-square-korede-bello-top-list/|archive-date=1 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> On December 7, 2018, he announced his departure from Mavins Records after 5 years.

In September 2019, he sacked his elder brother, Temi Solomon as his manager. When asked the reason he did that, he said: “It was just next level dealings, I wanted to get somewhere else, the vision became a lot farther, like I saw farther than I used to see and I just needed somebody that’ll see as much, most especially someone that’s been there with other people (artists) but me and my brother are cool".<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-09-11|title=Just in: Reekado Banks `sack’ brother as Manager|url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2019/09/just-in-reekado-banks-sack-brother-as-manager/|access-date=2021-02-26|website=Vanguard News|language=en-US}}</ref>After being away with no hit songs Reekado Banks came back in 2021 with a brand new tune titled "Ozumba Mbadiwe".
