All the members of the group are from the city of [[Istanbul]]. The group rose to fame in the year [[2005 in music|2005]] with their debut album ''[[Bir (Hepsi album)|Bir]]'', which spawned the hit songs "[[Olmaz Oğlan]]", "[[Üç Kalp]]", and "[[Herşeye Rağmen (Hepsi song)|Herşeye Rağmen]]", and the hugely successful song "[[Yalan]]". They later went on to release their first official [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Tempo (EP)|Tempo]]'', in association with [[Pepsi]], and worked with Turkish Pop legend [[Sezen Aksu]], famous for working with [[Tarkan (singer)|Tarkan]]. In [[2006 in music|2006]] they also released their second [[studio album]], ''[[Hepsi 2]]'', which spawned the huge hit "[[Kalpsizsin]]", and [[Aşk Sakızı]]. The group released their third [[studio album]] on 24 May 2008 called ''Şaka'' meaning "Joke" in [[English language|English]]. The group released their first single for this album on 23 May 2008, called "[[4 Peynirli Pizza]]" meaning "4 cheese pizza".

The group is largely followed in Turkey, with their audience being made up mainly of teenaged boys and girls and pre-teen girls.<ref name=grouphepsi.org>{{cite web |url=http://www.gruphepsi.org/gruphepsibiography.html |title=Grup Hepsi Biography - Discography - Other Info |publisher=Gruphepsi.org |accessdate=2012-03-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207064426/http://www.gruphepsi.org/gruphepsibiography.html |archivedate=2012-02-07 }}</ref>
The group also starred in their own [[soap opera]], called ''[[Hepsi 1]]'' on one of the main channels, [[ATV Turkey]].

The group has also announced that they have been working on a cinema movie due for release on 16 January 2009 which meant that the soap opera may be delayed also with their promotion of their new album.

== 2006–2007: ''Hepsi 2'' ==
{{main|Hepsi 2}}
In June 2006 the group released their second studio ''Hepsi 2''.  The first single from the album, "Kalpsizsin", in 2006, also became a huge hit, winning them an award at the Kral TV Music Awards for the best group. The second single was "Aşk Sakızı" in 2007 which also became a huge hit.

== 2008–2009: ''Şaka (10+1)'' ==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Saka (10+1) album cover.jpg|left|thumb|Event poster featuring Hepsi's third studio album ''Şaka 10+1''.]] -->

{{main|Şaka (10+1)}}
The group released their third studio album on 24 May 2008. The group stated that the third album was gonna be "different",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arsiv.sabah.com.tr/2007/11/18/gny/haber,021BD733D58943B6AA7C27B0D4284731.html |title=Günaydın - 18 Kasım 2007, Pazar - En büyük hayalimiz bir müzikale imza atmak! |publisher=Arsiv.sabah.com.tr |date=2007-11-18 |accessdate=2012-03-14}}</ref> suggesting there could be featured artists on this album as they have only had two featured artists, one on their first albums and one on their tempo single. On 3 May 2008, the album title was confirmed to be ''[[Şaka (10+1)]]''.

The album's name includes "(10+1)", because the ten songs featured on the album are covers of famous songs Hepsi have re-produced for their unique style. Some of the featured songs are from very famous singers in Turkey such as [[Ajda Pekkan]] and [[Sezen Aksu]], however there is only one brand new song in this album which is "[[4 Peynirli Pizza]]", written by [[Kenan Dogulu]]. "[[4 Peynirli Pizza]]" is the first single for this album and was released on 23 May 2008.

On their official website [3], there was a questionnaire asking for the visitors to vote on which song they want to be released as a single. However, on a TV program that they went on called ''Kulis'' on Powerturk music channel, and one of the group's member Cemre Kemer stated that for their latest album, they will have 5 singles. Their first one has already being released which is called "4 Peynirli Pizza" meaning '4 Cheese Pizzas' and the second one that will be released is called "Hep Bana" meaning 'All For Me'. There is no official release date for their second single yet; however the only information given about the second single for the album is that it will be aired on the Turkish television in mid December 2008. 
The rest from the five singles to be released from this album is, as stated by the group member Cemre, "Ask Herseyi Affedermi?" meaning 'Does Love Forgive?', "Simsiki" meaning 'Firmly/Tightly' and lastly "Onu alma Beni Al" meaning 'Don't take her take me'.

== Hepsi 1 ==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hepsi 1 Tv series.jpg|right|thumb|''Hepsi 1'' TV series]] -->
''[[Hepsi 1]]'' is a Turkish soap which airs once a week on [[ATV Turkey|ATV]], originally on Show TV. The soap shows the girls as pre-famous and how they became famous. The characters of themselves are over the top, however the show has some truth about the girls, such as their likes and dislikes.

Season one attracted many views with an average of 3.2 million viewers a week. Season two had an average of 2.5 million to 6 million viewers a week.

The last episode of the season 2 has aired on 3 June 2008. Although it was said by ATV that season 2 was going to be the last season, it has been confirmed by ATV that a season 3 for Hepsi1 will be made. 
It did seem quite a hard decision to be made by ATV because of the number of viewers changing every week from approximately 6 million viewers per week to 2.5 million viewers. However, because of a high number of requests to ATV and the number of viewers being quite high, ATV has confirmed that there will be a Season 3 made. Although it was confirmed it may have a long delay because of the group's promotion of their new album and also the recording of their movie.
