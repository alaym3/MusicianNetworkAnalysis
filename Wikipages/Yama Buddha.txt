==Legacy==
Unlike other Nepalese raps, Yama Buddha's songs are based on eclectic affairs. 'Saathi', 'Footpath Mero Ghar' and 'Yo Prasanga' depicts the real problems faced by Nepalese society such as poverty, drug addiction, sex trafficking and homelessness.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2017-01-21/voice-of-a-generation.html |title=Voice of a generation |publisher=The Kathmandu Post |ref=12 |last1=Aryal |first1=Timothy |access-date=24 January 2017}}</ref>  Songs on relationships are 'Ama (Mother)', 'Didi (Sister)', 'Pagalpan (Madness)'. Similarly, famous songs on other various narratives by Yama Buddha include 'Jutta ma', 'Audai chu ma' (for the movie Talak Jung Tulke), Aawaran (co Priyanka Karki). He also collaborated with artists Iraj, Chingy and Neha Kakkar in 'Nachana'. He frequently performed live abroad (among Nepali diaspora) in countries such as India, Australia, UK etc.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lexlimbu.com/blog/2017/01/15/yama-buddha-1987-2017/ |title=Yama Buddha 1987 – 2017 |access-date=15 January 2017}}</ref>
