'''The Dreadnoughts''' are a [[Canadian]] 6-piece [[folk-punk]] band from [[Vancouver]]. The band combines a wide range of [[List of European folk music traditions|European folk music]] with modern [[street punk]].  The band has five full-length albums and three EPs on various labels, and has played around 500 shows in around 30 countries. They also perform frequently as a traditional polka band at polka festivals, under the name "Polka Time!". Their performance peak was in 2010, when 180 shows were played.

==History==
The Dreadnoughts formed in 2006 in the [[Downtown Eastside]] area of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. They released their first album, ''Legends Never Die'', in 2007, followed by their second album, ''Victory Square'', in 2009. They wrote ''Victory Square'' as a tribute to their home city of Vancouver, and as such, many of the songs on the album focus on places of importance to the bandmembers.<ref>{{Citation|title=STOKED: The Dreadnoughts Return|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX_AEFH3QMU|language=en|access-date=2021-08-05}}</ref> The Dreadnoughts promoted the album by touring all over Canada and Europe in 2009, a tour which inspired much of the material on their 2010 album ''Polka's Not Dead''. The tour was documented in a book by Adam PW Smith, who would later produce a mini-documentary about the band as well.

In late 2011, after producing ''Polka's Not Dead,'' the band announced an indefinite hiatus. However, they followed this by playing shows occasionally, such as annual Vancouver shows, a two-week European tour in January 2014, and two March gigs with [[Guttermouth]] in 2014. On November 11, 2017 they released their fourth full-length album ''Foreign Skies'', a folk-punk concept album about the [[World War I|First World War.]] They followed this up with the acoustic album ''Into The North'' on November 15, 2019. They are currently writing a sixth album, to be released in early 2022.

==Sound and influences==
Noticeable influences in their sound include acts such as [[The Pogues]], [[Dropkick Murphys]], [[Stan Rogers]], [[Gogol Bordello]], [[Goran Bregovic]], and [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]]. The band commonly record and perform [[Sea shanty|sea shanties]], [[polka]]s and [[klezmer]] songs, and are also strongly influenced by English [[West Country]] folk music - in particular the Bristol folk band [[The Wurzels]].<ref name="folkpunk">{{cite web | last = Poon | first = Christopher | title = Dreadnoughts charting course on sea of cider | publisher = straight.com | year = 2010 | url = https://www.straight.com/article-276193/vancouver/dreadnoughts-charting-course-sea-cider | format = Web | accessdate = 2010-06-06 }}</ref>
