''' Das EFX''' is an [[United States|American]] [[hip hop music|hip hop]] duo.<ref name="Larkin90">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=113}}</ref> It consists of [[rapper|emcees]]  '''Dray''' (also known as '''Krazy Drayz''', born '''Andre Weston''',  September 9, 1970) and '''Skoob''' (also known as '''Books''', born '''William "Willie" Hines''', November 27, 1970).<ref name="Larkin90"/> They named themselves "DAS" standing for "Dray and Skoob" and "EFX" meaning "effects". They rose to popularity in the early 1990s due to the duo's [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] lyrical delivery, which became one of the most influential lyrical styles in rap music at the time;<ref name="auto"/> as well as their affiliation with [[EPMD]]'s [[Hit Squad]]. Their style combined intricate rhymes, sometimes mixed with made up words (especially ending with "-iggedy"), delivered with a fast-paced flow and numerous [[Popular culture|pop culture]] and hip hop culture references.<ref name="Larkin90"/>

==History==
Skoob hails from [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York City]] while Dray hails from [[Teaneck, New Jersey]], but the two met at [[Virginia State University]] in 1988 and began performing together.<ref name="Larkin90"/>  Das EFX caught the attention of EPMD at a local talent show where, despite losing the competition, they did well enough to convince EPMD to sign them to a recording contract.<ref name="Larkin90"/> The duo gained critical and commercial fame with the release of their landmark debut album ''[[Dead Serious (album)|Dead Serious]]'',<ref name="Larkin90"/> which highlighted their unusual rapping style (which they nicknamed "sewage").

''Dead Serious'' went [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] and its lead single, "They Want EFX," (which contains samples from [[James Brown]]'s "Blind Man Can See It" and [[Malcolm McLaren]]'s "[[Buffalo Gals]]")  reached the top ten on the [[United States|U.S.]] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] [[record chart|chart]], the Top 40 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and No. 1 on the [[Hot Rap Songs|Hot Rap Tracks]] chart. Follow-up singles "Mic Checka" and "Straight Out the Sewer" did not chart on the Hot 100, but reached No. 1 and No. 3 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart, respectively.

The duo also made a guest appearance on the remix of [[Ice Cube]]'s smash hit single "[[Check Yo Self]]". The song reached No. 20 on the Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Rap Tracks chart. The track peaked at #36 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in August 1993 and sold over one million copies in the U.S.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

As their career progressed, Das EFX's once-distinctive and unique lyrical delivery was imitated by several other artists and became more commonplace.<ref name="Larkin90"/> Derailed by the popularity of their own style, the duo slowed down their fast-paced flow, eliminated the ''iggedy'' [[suffix]] and downplayed their [[cartoonish]] content on their second album, ''[[Straight Up Sewaside]]''.<ref name="Larkin90"/>

Around the time of their third album ''[[Hold It Down (Das EFX album)|Hold It Down]]'' (which was far less commercially successful than their debut release), Das EFX found themselves caught in the middle of [[EPMD]]'s ugly breakup. They ended up siding with PMD (Parrish Smith), and it led to a three-year absence from recording. They returned in 1998 with the album ''[[Generation EFX]]''<ref name="Larkin90"/> and followed up in 2003 with the album ''[[How We Do (album)|How We Do]]''.

After a hiatus, the group went on an international tour with DJ Rondevu in 2006.  In 2007, the duo appeared on the remix of [[Nas]]' "Where are They Now" and continued to tour the globe on a regular basis. They toured again in 2010, and continue to record and perform today to a smaller, yet devoted [[cult following]].

==Influence==
From the time of their debut in 1992 to 1993, several elements of their style were adopted by other hip-hop artists, including [[Lords of the Underground]], [[Fu-Schnickens]], [[Kris Kross]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]] and even, to a lesser extent, [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]. The 1996 [[BLACKstreet]] song "[[No Diggity]]", with "diggity" meaning "doubt", bears a title phonetically identical to the track "No Diggedy" on DAS EFX's 1995 release ''[[Hold It Down (Das EFX album)|Hold It Down]]''.<ref name="Larkin90"/> 

===''Chappelle's Show''===
Comedian [[Dave Chappelle]] has made numerous references to DAS EFX's unique style and lyrics in sketches of his popular ''[[Chappelle's Show]]''. In one sketch, a teenage Chappelle tells his girlfriend "I riggity-realize that I liggity-love you." In another, Chappelle as [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] announced that a country named "Riggity-Row" will join the [[Coalition of the willing]]. In yet another sketch, Chappelle as a [[news presenter]] announces the opening lyrics of "They Want EFX" as a [[special report]].
