'''Army of Lovers''' is a Swedish [[dance music|dance]]-[[pop music|pop]] group which formed in 1987 and had a number of hits in [[Europe]] throughout the 1990s. Some of their biggest successes include the song "[[Crucified (Army of Lovers song)|Crucified]]", which was a big hit in Europe, charting 31 weeks in the [[Eurochart Hot 100 Singles|Eurochart]] and peaking at number 14 in 1992. It remains their best-known song internationally. Their second international hit, "Obsession", charted 32 weeks and peaked at number 29.

The name of the band alludes to the documentary film ''[[Army of Lovers or Revolt of the Perverts]]'' by German gay rights activist [[Rosa von Praunheim]], the title of which in turn alludes to the [[Sacred Band of Thebes]].

==History==
===Overview===
The founding members, who had all worked together in a band called Barbie, were [[Alexander Bard]], [[Jean-Pierre Barda]], and [[Camilla Henemark]] (aka La Camilla).

Army of Lovers had many top 10 hits on the [[Eurochart Hot 100 Singles|Eurochart]], the biggest being "[[Crucified (Army of Lovers song)|Crucified]]", which was one of the biggest-selling European singles of 1991. Their total album sales were seven million copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.armyoflovers.net/information/sales-charts-awards/ |title=Sales, Charts & Awards - Army Of Lovers . net |publisher=Armyoflovers.net |access-date=21 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309100312/http://www.armyoflovers.net/information/sales-charts-awards/ |archive-date=9 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The band became famous for their outlandish visual appearance (many of their costumes were created by [[Camilla Thulin]]), and their high camp music videos directed by Fredrik Boklund.

While [[Alexander Bard]] was the brain behind the band, [[Jean-Pierre Barda]] was the lead vocalist on hits such as "[[Crucified (Army of Lovers song)|Crucified]]" and "[[Israelism]]". Bard and Barda were the only two band members who were present throughout all of the band's various line-ups. When La Camilla left in 1991, she was replaced by [[Michaela de la Cour]]. In 1992, [[Dominika Peczynski]] joined, making the band a four-piece. In 1995, De la Cour left and Henemark returned.

===Early success and breakup: 1987–1996===
Although both "[[Obsession (Army of Lovers song)|Obsession]]" and "[[Ride the Bullet]]" reached the top spot of the European charts, the group's presence in the US and the UK was limited to club chart successes (though "Crucified" reached the [[Top 40]] in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in February 1992).<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

While they focused on experimenting with various club sounds and samples on their first album, ''Disco Extravaganza'' (later re-issued as ''Army of Lovers'' in the US), the artists released a proper pop/dance album with ''[[Massive Luxury Overdose]]''. The record spawned their biggest hits ("[[Crucified (Army of Lovers song)|Crucified]]", "[[Ride the Bullet]]", and "[[Obsession (Army of Lovers song)|Obsession]]") and managed to sell 250,000 copies in Germany alone. ''[[Massive Luxury Overdose]]'' was later re-issued for the US market, featuring a new cover and four brand new tracks. Their fourth album, ''The Gods of Earth and Heaven'', was never released in the US. The first single from the album, "[[Israelism]]", received radio airplay in several European countries and topped the charts in [[Israel]] despite being subject to criticism. Their fifth album, ''Glory, Glamour and Gold'' (1994), was supported by a club tour across Germany, where the band promoted same-sex marriage. In 1995, Army of Lovers released their first best-of compilation entitled ''Les Greatest Hits'', which included three new songs. One year later, it was re-released with one additional new song called "[[King Midas (Army of Lovers song)|King Midas]]",  which replaced "Stand up for Myself". It was written by [[Jonas Berggren]] from [[Ace of Base]].

By this point, they had released five studio albums, made over twenty music videos, and become successful across Eastern Europe before Bard disbanded the group to concentrate on his new group [[Vacuum (band)|Vacuum]] in 1996.

===Reunion: 2001–2009===
Army of Lovers reformed briefly in 2001 to celebrate the 10th anniversary since their breakthrough with the release of another best-of compilation called ''Le Grand Docu-Soap''. The compilation contained three covers, including "Let the Sunshine In" and "Hands Up".

===Further reunions, releases, and shows: 2011–present===
Two members of Army of Lovers (La Camilla and Dominika) reunited in June 2011 and appeared as guest vocalists on "Don't Try to Steal My Limelight", a single by Swedish drag artist and blogger Miss Inga.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/webbtv/noje/article13263464.ab |title=Exklusivt: 90-talsikonernas comeback &#124; Nöjesbladet &#124; Webbtv &#124; Aftonbladet |publisher=Aftonbladet.se |access-date=1 May 2012}}</ref> The three later formed the band Happy Hoes and released "We Rule the World",<ref name="ball">{{cite web|url=http://www.armyoflovers.net/2012/06/25/happy-hoes-getting-the-ball-rolling/ |title=Happy Hoes: Getting the ball rolling - armyoflovers.net |publisher=army-of-lovers.net |access-date=8 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035704/http://www.armyoflovers.net/2012/06/25/happy-hoes-getting-the-ball-rolling/ |archive-date=4 March 2016 }}</ref> followed by a Christmas song entitled "Happy Ho Ho Ho".

Just a few days after their performance, Bard explained to the press that [[Camilla Henemark]] had been kicked out once again and that [[Dominika Peczynski]] had returned. This was followed by a public fight between Bard and Peczynski against Henemark.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://12points.tv/more-nationals-13/item/1718-army-of-lovers-la-camilla-says-love-forgive-forget |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130702113336/http://12points.tv/more-nationals-13/item/1718-army-of-lovers-la-camilla-says-love-forgive-forget |archive-date=2 July 2013 |title=Army of Lovers' La Camilla says: love, forgive, forget |url-status=dead |access-date=2 July 2013 }}</ref>

A new best-of compilation, with four new songs, called ''Big Battle of Egos'', was announced for release on 27 March 2013, to be followed by a single and video called "Signed on My Tattoo", a duet between Army of Lovers and Alexander Bard with his other pop group [[Gravitonas]].

In June 2013, an EP called ''Scandinavian Crime'' was released, which included re-recorded versions of "Rockin' The Ride" and "Tragedy", originally from their CD ''Big Battle of Egos''. These new versions featured new vocals by [[Dominika Peczynski]] and [[Jean-Pierre Barda]], replacing the parts originally sung by Camilla Henemark. On 1 July 2013, the video for "Crucified 2013" premiered on Expressen TV. The song was a revamped version of the band's breakthrough hit from 1991 and was chosen as the official anthem for [[Copenhagen Pride]] 2013.{{cn|date=January 2020}} Versions with bridge vocals by both Peczynski and Henemark exist.

The band still does live performances on special occasions; Alexander Bard officially retired from the music business in 2015.{{cn|date=January 2020}}

A new documentary, ''Army of Lovers in the Holy Land'', premiered in September 2018 at Haifa International Film Festival in Israel.{{cn|date=January 2020}}
