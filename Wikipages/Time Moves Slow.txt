"'''Time Moves Slow'''" is a song by Canadian instrumental group [[BadBadNotGood|BADBADNOTGOOD]] and American singer [[Samuel T.

The track received renewed attention in June 2021 when a beat that heavily samples the track went viral on [[TikTok]]; this beat, "'''Running Away'''" by VANO 3000, was officially released with the band on June 21, 2021.

== Background and release ==
The band first connected with [[Future Islands]] frontman [[Samuel T. Herring]] in 2014 when they remixed/reinterpreted their track "[[Seasons (Waiting on You)]]". Following their collaboration, BadBadNotGood invited Herring to their Toronto studio to work on some music for their album. From these sessions, they wrote and recorded "Time Moves Slow" as well as the non-album single "I Don't Know".<ref>{{Cite web|title=BBNG x RBMA Animation|url=https://innovativeleisure.net/blogs/news/bbng-x-rbma-animation|access-date=2021-06-21|website=Innovative Leisure|language=en}}</ref>
