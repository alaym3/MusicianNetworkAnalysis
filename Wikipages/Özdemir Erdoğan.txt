==Early life==
Of [[Armenians|Armenian]] descent on his maternal side and [[Circassians|Circassian]] and [[Turkish people|Turkish]] descent on his paternal side,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/ozdemir-erdogandan-elestiri-bombardimani-39016279 | title = Üç saat süren konserinde önce kendisini tanıtan Özdemir Erdoğan, annesinin Ermeni, babaannesinin Çerkez, babasının ise Karadenizli olduğunu ve kendisinin de kırma sayılacağını söyledi. | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160808012249/http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/ozdemir-erdogandan-elestiri-bombardimani-39016279 | archive-date = 8 August 2016 | access-date = 18 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.posta.com.tr/turkiyeyi-birakamayinca-37-yillik-evliligi-bitti-haberi-284160 | title = Özdemir Erdoğan, müziğe ilk aşinalığını Ermeni asıllı annesinin tarafından alır.

His mother was an ethnic Armenian who was a classical pianist, and his uncle was a piano and violin player as well. The first training was taken from these channels from a young age. The unique conditions between the years 1940 and 1950 are one of the important factors preventing Özdemir Erdogan from receiving formal arts education. Another issue is that his father prescribes an absolute basic education with the conditions of those dates. In this educational process, which lasted until the age of 15–16, Özdemir Erdoğan's artistic subjects were more likely to be found which were supported by his teachers at the schools.

Özdemir Erdoğan graduated from [[Kadıköy|Kadikoy Commercial High School]] in 1960 and completed his military service as a reserve officer teacher in Adıyaman, Besni Araplar village as a teacher.
