==History==
===2009–2010: Formation and debut album===
The Wanted were formed in 2009 through mass auditions held by Jayne Collins, who also put together [[the Saturdays]] and [[Parade (band)|Parade]].<ref name=mtv>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/artists/the-wanted|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630021308/http://www.mtv.co.uk/artists/the-wanted|url-status=dead|archive-date=30 June 2010|title=MTV > The Wanted|publisher=MTV UK|access-date=2 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite interview|url=http://voice21.justyouth.org.uk/features/interview-with-the-wanted/|title=Interview with The Wanted|interviewer=Leah Bargota|publisher=Voice21|date=26 November 2010|access-date=2 September 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426072417/http://voice21.justyouth.org.uk/features/interview-with-the-wanted/|archive-date=26 April 2012}}</ref> The audition process, which saw more than 1,000 people attend, took over nine months. Just George, Parker and Sykes were involved at the start, and Kaneswaran and McGuiness joined later through the process. The group revealed in their autobiography that after they were informed of the line-up, seven more people were re-auditioned before they were signed to Maximum Artist Management and Geffen Records.

The group were credited with co-writing five of the thirteen tracks on the album. On 25 July 2010, they released their debut single, "[[All Time Low (The Wanted song)|All Time Low]]". The song was co-written by [[Steve Mac]] (who also produced it), [[Wayne Hector]] and [[Ed Drewett]]. It hit number one in the UK and spent 17 weeks in the UK top 40. The second single "[[Heart Vacancy]]", again written with Hector, was released on 17 October 2010. It peaked at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The group's third single from the album was "[[Lose My Mind (The Wanted song)|Lose My Mind]]", which reached number 19 on the UK Singles Chart following a performance on ''[[The X Factor (British TV series)|The X Factor]]''. The group's eponymous debut album was released on 25 October 2010 and peaked at number four in the UK and has since been certified Platinum in the UK. Between 28 March and 15 April 2010, the group embarked on the fifteen-date Behind Bars theatre tour, which saw them play in twelve UK cities. They were supported by [[Lawson (band)|Lawson]], [[Twenty Twenty]] and [[Starboy Nathan]].

===2011–2012: ''Battleground'' and ''The Wanted: The EP''===
In January 2011, the group began to work on their second studio album. The album featured writing credits from the band members on ten of the fifteen tracks, and contributions from [[Steve Mac]], [[Wayne Hector]], [[Ed Drewett]], [[Diane Warren]] and [[Guy Chambers]]. The album's lead single, "Gold Forever", was released in aid of [[Comic Relief]]<ref>{{cite interview|last=George|first=Max |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/interviews/a299892/the-wanted.html|title=The Wanted|interviewer=Robert Copsey|work=Digital Spy|date=25 January 2011|access-date=3 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/12415384|title=The Wanted record official song for Comic Relief|publisher=BBC|date=10 February 2011|access-date=3 September 2011}}</ref> and debuted at number three on the UK Singles Chart. In July 2011, the group released the album's second single, "[[Glad You Came]]", which became their second number-one single. It was number one for two weeks, and stayed in the top ten of the chart for six weeks. The single also reached number one in Ireland and remained there for five weeks.<ref name=ire/> The song also charted in some European territories, and was very successful in Australia. The third single from the album, "Lightning", was released on 16 October 2011, peaking at number 2 in the UK and number 5 in Ireland. The fourth single, "[[Warzone (song)|Warzone]]", was released on 26 December 2011, with the music video and radio debut coming in early November 2011. On 7 November 2011, the group's second album ''[[Battleground (album)|Battleground]]'' was released. It debuted at number 5 in the UK and number 4 in Ireland. It has since been certified Platinum in the UK. In addition to shows in the United Kingdom, including [[T4 on the Beach]], [[V Festival]], and the [[Apple Music Festival|iTunes Festival]], the group supported Canadian singer [[Justin Bieber]] in Brazil on 8 and 9 October 2011 and [[Britney Spears]] on her [[Femme Fatale Tour]] at the [[Manchester Evening News Arena]] on 6 November 2011.

Between 15 February and 9 March 2012, the group embarked on "The Code" tour, to promote the release of the album. The 16-date arena tour saw the group play in thirteen cities in England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland and Northern Ireland. Known as #TheCodeTour, each concert featured an interactive element that linked to the group's official [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] pages.

In a bid to break into the United States market, the Wanted went on a short promotional radio and club tour of the United States, touring between 17 January to 8 February 2012. The success of the 10-date tour led to the group's official release of their debut American single, "Glad You Came". It peaked at number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and has since sold over 3 million copies there. Their debut American EP, ''[[The Wanted (EP)|The Wanted: The EP]]'', was released in April 2012, debuting at number seven in the US and number eight in Canada. "[[Chasing the Sun (The Wanted song)|Chasing the Sun]]" was released as the band's second official single there, peaking at number 50 on the ''Billboard''Hot 100 whilst also reaching number one on the [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] chart. "Chasing the Sun" was released on 21 May 2012. On 22 May 2012, the band opened and performed at the first Q102's Springle Ball concert. On 14 June 2012 the band performed a concert at New York City's [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theater]], which was also broadcast live on music television station [[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse]]. The group visited Australia and New Zealand for the promotion of their [[extended play]] in August 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/The-Wanted-coming-to-New-Zealand/tabid/418/articleID/259962/Default.aspx|title=The Wanted coming to New Zealand |publisher=3 News|date=3 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112160155/http://www.3news.co.nz/The-Wanted-coming-to-New-Zealand/tabid/418/articleID/259962/Default.aspx|archive-date=2013-11-12}}</ref> Following their promotional tour of Australia, the group headed to the US for a number of promotional concerts.

===2012–2014: ''Word of Mouth'', ''The Wanted Life'' and indefinite hiatus===
The Wanted began working on their third studio album shortly after the release of ''Battleground'' on 4 November 2011. In May 2012, "[[Chasing the Sun (The Wanted song)|Chasing the Sun]]" was released as the album's lead single, and the third single from the band's ''The Wanted: The EP'' in the United States. Around this time, the band also premiered a brand new track called "Satellite", which was co-written by [[Ryan Tedder]] of [[OneRepublic]]. In August 2012, the band filmed a music video in Los Angeles, reportedly for their brand new single, "[[I Found You (The Wanted song)|I Found You]]". However, when the video for "I Found You" was released in October 2012, it was a different one. The band later revealed that they had reshot the video in London, not being satisfied with the first one. The original was later released as the "fan version" on [[Vevo]]. "I Found You" was released on 5 November 2012 as the album's second single.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idolator.com/6887992/the-wanted-i-found-you|title=The Wanted's "I Found You": Hear Their New Single|last=Daw|first=Robbie|date=7 September 2012|work=Idolator|access-date=18 November 2012}}</ref>

The band confirmed in September 2012 that the album would contain a number of collaborations, including tracks with [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]], [[LMFAO]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1692284/the-wanted-lmfao-album-collabo.jhtml|title=The Wanted Tease 'Insane' LMFAO Collabos|last=Garibaldi|first=Christina |publisher=MTV|date=21 August 2012|access-date=18 November 2012}}</ref> [[Chris Brown]], [[Rita Ora]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heatworld.com/Entertainment/Music/2012/07/The-Wanted-Well-turn-down-Rita-Ora-songs-if-theyre-not-good-enough-/|title=The Wanted "We'll turn down Rita Ora songs if they're not good enough"|last=Wilkinson|first=Sophie|work=heatworld.com|date=2012-07-16|access-date=2012-11-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718064349/http://www.heatworld.com/Entertainment/Music/2012/07/The-Wanted-Well-turn-down-Rita-Ora-songs-if-theyre-not-good-enough-/|archive-date=2012-07-18}}</ref> and [[Dappy]].<ref>{{cite web|author=lfoley |url=http://www.sugarscape.com/main-topics/music/767413/exclusive-dappy-wanted-nathan-sykes-collaboration |title=EXCLUSIVE: Dappy reveals all the details about new The Wanted collaboration 'Bring It Home' |work=Sugarscape |date=21 September 2012 |access-date=18 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923191024/http://www.sugarscape.com/main-topics/music/767413/exclusive-dappy-wanted-nathan-sykes-collaboration|archive-date=2012-09-23}}</ref> In November 2012, the band announced that the album had been pushed back from the original release of 3 December 2012 to February 2013 at their request; the reason stated for this delay was to perfect the album, and "tweak out a few insecurities involving certain tracks".

In early February 2013, it was announced that the Wanted would star in their own reality series called ''[[The Wanted Life]]'' which premiered internationally in Autumn 2013.
