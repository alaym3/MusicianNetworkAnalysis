==History==
===Early works, remixes, and Ed Banger (2003–2006)===
Justice first produced tracks together for Musclorvision's "Hits Up to You", a concept compilation where tracks were designed to sound like they were meant for the [[Eurovision]] song contest.<ref>{{cite web| title =Musclorvision – Hits Up To You |publisher=Discogs |url=http://www.discogs.com/release/680532 |access-date=21 December 2008 }}</ref> The compilation included two of their songs, and a track by Augé's alter-ego Microloisir.<ref>{{cite web |title =Microloisir |publisher=Discogs |url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Microloisir |access-date=21 December 2008 }}</ref> Justice first came to prominence through its 2003 remix of [[Simian (band)|Simian's]] track "Never Be Alone", created for a Paris college radio station's remix contest.<ref name="NYT1" /> The remix resulted in the group being signed to Ed Banger (who released it) and became a hit in clubs and on the Internet.<ref name="NYT1" /> The song was re-released in 2004 on [[DJ Hell]]'s [[International DeeJay Gigolo Records]]<ref name="RAbio">[http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj-profile.aspx?id=865 RA: DJ Justice Biography & Discography<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930201442/http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj-profile.aspx?id=865 |date=30 September 2007 }}</ref> and eventually given a commercial release in the UK in the summer of 2006 under the title "[[We Are Your Friends (song)|We Are Your Friends]]" on Ten Records, a sub-label of [[Virgin Records]].

After the original release of "We Are Your Friends", Justice worked on remixes<ref name="RAbio" /> for a number of French groups (Vicarious Bliss, Scenario Rock, and Gambit) as well as for larger mainstream acts such as [[Britney Spears]],<ref name="RAbio" /> [[N.E.R.D|N*E*R*D]],<ref name="RAbio" /> [[Norman Cook|Fatboy Slim]],<ref name="RAbio" /> and [[Daft Punk]].<ref name="RAbio" /> Justice's first solo single, "[[Waters of Nazareth]]", was released on [[Ed Banger Records]] in September 2005 and was championed by DJs such as [[Erol Alkan]], [[Eddy Temple-Morris]], [[Tiga (musician)|Tiga]], [[2 Many DJ's]], and [[Ivan Smagghe]]. The track was re-released in 2006 with additional remixes. The duo's prolific remix work continued, as it turned in mixes for [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]], [[Mystery Jets]], [[Soulwax]], and [[Mr. Oizo]].

Justice won the award for Best Video at the [[MTV Europe Music Awards]] 2006 for Justice vs. Simian – "[[We Are Your Friends (song)|We Are Your Friends]]". Augé and de Rosnay were not present at the ceremony, and the award was accepted by label art director "So Me" and video director Jérémie Rozan.

===''Cross'', rise to fame (2007–2010)===
Justice's debut album, titled ''[[Cross (Justice album)|Cross]]'', was released on Ed Banger Records on 11 June 2007. The album was released in the United States on Downtown/Ed Banger. The album was preceded by the ''[[D.A.N.C.E.]] EP'', released on 28 May 2007, which featured the tracks "Phantom" and the band's own remix of "D.A.N.C.E.", titled "B.E.A.T". "D.A.N.C.E." was nominated for "Video of the Year" at the [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards]]. On 1 November, Justice received the "Video Star" award at the European Music Awards in Munich and was named the Best French Act of the Year. Justice was chosen to do a mix for the [[Fabriclive]] series in 2008, but Fabric rejected it. De Rosnay said that, "[T]hey weren't ready for something like this." Now titled "Justice Xmas Mix", the mix is available on the Internet.<ref>Pitchfork article [http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/page/news/47956-update-rejected-justice-fabric-mix-turned-xmas-gift title unknown] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112191610/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/page/news/47956-update-rejected-justice-fabric-mix-turned-xmas-gift |date=12 January 2008 }}</ref>

Justice appeared as a [[Live PA]] at the 2007 [[Parklife Music Festival|Parklife]] and festivals around Australia, the 2008 [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]] festival; the 2007 and 2008 [[Sónar]] festival in Barcelona; [[Fuji Rock Festival]] in [[Niigata Prefecture|Niigata]], Japan; the [[Hultsfred Festival]] in [[Hultsfred]], Sweden; the [[Oxegen]] festival in [[Kildare]], Ireland; the [[T in the Park]] festival in [[Kinross]], Scotland; the Reading and Leeds Festivals in England; the [[Vieilles Charrues Festival]] in [[Carhaix]], France; the [[Roskilde Festival]] in [[Roskilde]], Denmark; [[Pukkelpop]] in Belgium, at the "I LOVE TECHNO" festival in Ghent, [[Belgium]]; [[Dour Festival]] in Belgium; [[Rock Werchter]] in Belgium; the [[Lowlands (music festival)|Lowlands]] festival and the [[Pinkpop]] festival in The Netherlands; at Tennents Vital in the Radio One Tent in [[Belfast]]; at the [[Phoenix Park#Concerts|Phoenix Park Marquee]] in Dublin; and at the [[Festival Internacional de Benicàssim]] in Spain.

Justice was nominated for Best Dance Recording (for "D.A.N.C.E.") and Best Electronic/Dance Album (for ''Cross'') at the [[50th Grammy Awards]].<ref>[http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/50th_Show/list.aspx "50th Annual Grammy Awards Nominations List"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208155421/http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/50th_Show/list.aspx |date= 8 December 2007 }}.</ref> Justice released their music video for "[[Stress (Justice song)|Stress]]" on 1 May 2008. The clip features a group of youths committing acts of vandalism and harassment, wearing jackets bearing the Justice cross on the back. Accused in some quarters of racism for its stereotypical depiction of youths of African descent (both [[Black people in France|black]] and [[Beur|North African]]) from Paris' socially deprived [[banlieues]] (outer suburbs), others saw the video as a critique of the portrayal of blacks in the French media.<ref>{{cite news |title=Uproar Over French Music Video |work=TIME |date = 19 May 2008 |url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1807724,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521003038/http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1807724,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 May 2008 |access-date =21 December 2008 }}</ref> Speaking in an interview with [[The Quietus]] website, Augé said, "We were expecting some fuss obviously, but definitely not on those topics... If people see racism in the video, it's definitely because they might have a problem with racism; because they only see black people beating up white people, which is not what happens."<ref>{{cite web |title =''A Cross The Universe'': Justice Interviewed |publisher=[[The Quietus]] |date = 28 October 2008 |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/00584-a-cross-the-universe-justice-interviewed |access-date =21 December 2008}}</ref>

In an interview for Dummy in 2005, Justice said that it wanted a strong concept for each record it put out, and with this one, the duo wanted to keep people guessing. Asked in an interview whether their cross-based themes had received any negative feedback, De Rosnay said, "Eighty percent of France is Christian. My Dad was a bit uncertain and thought it was bad taste, but I was like, This is what I want to do Dad. It's odd because in America we have received support from Christian groups thanking us for spreading the word. We do not invert the cross and I suppose they think we look like nice guys so there has not been a problem."<ref>{{cite web |title =From the Dummy Magazine Archive: Justice Interview |publisher=Dummy Magazine Blog |date = 9 January 2008 |url =http://dummymag.blogspot.com/2008/01/from-dummy-magazine-archive-justice.html |access-date =21 December 2008}}</ref>

On 1 June 2008, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' announced that Justice was chosen by [[Anthony Kiedis]] of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] to produce the band's follow up to ''[[Stadium Arcadium]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.nme.com/news/tabloid-hell/37771 |title =Justice to produce Red Hot Chili Peppers album – Tabloid Hell |access-date =1 July 2008 |publisher=[[NME]].com }}</ref> but this was quickly corrected by Ed Banger manager [[Pedro Winter]], as Anthony Kiedis had only stated he was a fan of Justice, not preparing for a collaboration.<ref>{{cite web |url =http://www.mixmag.net/content/justice-not-producing-red-hot-chili-peppers-album |title =Justice not producing Red Hot Chili Peppers album |access-date =1 July 2008 |publisher =[[Mixmag]].net |url-status =dead |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20081010233323/http://www.mixmag.net/content/justice-not-producing-red-hot-chili-peppers-album |archive-date =10 October 2008 |df =dmy-all }}</ref> In July 2008, Justice was revealed to have done a mix for the [[Dior Homme]] Summer 2009 Fashion Show, much like [[Daft Punk]] did for [[Louis Vuitton]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://asianmandan.blogspot.com/2008/07/jusice-x-dior-homme.html |title=Asian Dan: Justice x Dior Homme: Spring-Summer 09 Mix |access-date=16 August 2008 |publisher=Asian Dan |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708024022/http://asianmandan.blogspot.com/2008/07/jusice-x-dior-homme.html |archive-date=8 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
The track, now known as Planisphère, was released in four parts on the band's MySpace page.

On 25 August 2008, the band announced via MySpace that its next major release would be a DVD documentary/concert film titled ''[[A Cross the Universe (film)|A Cross the Universe]]''. The announcement was also tied in with an invitation for fans to email photos, images, and artwork to an address so that the received photos could be compiled for use as artwork for the release. An iconic scene in ''A Cross The Universe'' happens in Las Vegas where, as a homage to US hard rock singer [[Axl Rose]], Gaspard marries a groupie whom he had met three hours previously.<ref name="justicemarry">{{cite web |url = http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x85oqc_eleanor-conway-presents-a-little-ju_music?from=rss |title = Eleanor Conway Presents: Justice|website=Dailymotion.com|access-date=28 January 2018}}</ref> During a DJ tour for the release of ''A Cross the Universe'' in November 2008, controversy arose when a photograph of Augé DJing with an unplugged [[Akai]] MPD24 surfaced. The photograph sparked accusations that Justice's live sets were faked. Augé has since said that the equipment was unplugged very briefly before being reattached and the band put a three-photo set of the incident on their MySpace page.<ref>{{cite web |title=Justice Unplugged |publisher=URB |date=18 November 2008 |url=http://www.urb.com/permalink/4148/Justice-Unplugged.html |access-date=19 December 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219181927/http://www.urb.com/permalink/4148/Justice-Unplugged.html |archive-date=19 December 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>[http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=37697_0_2_0_C "Justice (don't) fake DJ set – (false) panic in technoland"].</ref>

In the November 2009 issue of ''[[Mixmag]]'', Justice stated that it would be working on the soundtrack for Mr. Oizo's upcoming film, ''[[Rubber (2010 film)|Rubber]]'', saying they had to "finish working on the soundtrack for Mr. Oizo's new film before we start recording for the new album." In April 2009, the music website Stereogum hosted a remix by the duo of [[U2]]'s song "[[Get on Your Boots]]", the lead single from the band's most recent album ''[[No Line on the Horizon]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stereogum.com/archives/justice-u2-remix-mp3_062471.html |title=New U2 – "Get on Your Boots (Justice Remix)" (Stereogum Premiere) |publisher=Stereogum |access-date=14 January 2011}}</ref> Their remix of [[Lenny Kravitz]]'s song "[[Let Love Rule (song)|Let Love Rule]]" was also featured on [[Kanye West]]'s blog.<ref>[http://www.kanyeuniversecity.com/blog/index.php?em3106=229797_-1__0_~0_-1_4_2009_0_0&eM= "Justice Remixes Lenny Kravitz"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724001929/http://www.kanyeuniversecity.com/blog/index.php?em3106=229797_-1__0_~0_-1_4_2009_0_0&eM= |date=24 July 2009 }}. 27 April 2009.</ref> Also in April 2009 at the Coachella Valley Music Festival, Augé was seen at the "Dome" with Busy P, DJ Mehdi, and Daft Punk.{{Citation needed|reason=A quick Google search revealed hearsay and no credible sources|date=April 2012}} They played at the 2009 Voodoo Experience in New Orleans, as well as at the HARD Haunted Mansion in LA over the Halloween weekend.<ref>Graff, Gary (25 June 2009).

===''Audio, Video, Disco'' (2011–14)===
On 14 March 2011, the duo announced via its Facebook page plans to release a new single entitled "Civilization" on 4 April. It was released on [[Ed Banger]] and [[Because Music|Because]] Records and was the first single off of its sophomore LP. The song has also been featured as the soundtrack to a new [[Adidas]] campaign spearheaded by French director [[Romain Gavras]], with whom Justice has worked in the past.<ref>Phillips, Amy (14 March 2011). [https://pitchfork.com/news/41863-justice-return-with-civilization/ "Justice Return With "Civilization""]. "Pitchfork".</ref>

On 28 March 2011, the Justice single, "[[Civilization (Justice song)|Civilization]]" was released as a one-week iTunes exclusive, in full, as a premier for the release of the single on 4 April. On 27 May, the duo released the official music video for the single on YouTube. The video relies heavily on CGI and illustrates a world in which famous monuments (such as the [[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]] monument in [[Rio de Janeiro]]) are destroyed as gravity appears to be reversed. The storyline is of a herd of bison running from the falling ruins.

In August 2011, the band announced that its sophomore record, ''[[Audio, Video, Disco]]'', would be released 24 October 2011.<ref name=AVD /> In an interview with French magazine ''Tsugi'', the duo disclosed the 11 song track list of the album, and described it as "a [[progressive rock]] record, played by guys that don't know how to play".<ref>[http://www.tsugi.fr/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5446&Itemid=9 "Justice on the cover of our next issue"].

On 6 September 2011, a music video for the single 'Audio Video Disco' was released by the duo via their Facebook page. The video features Xavier and Gaspard in a studio setting, and details the lengthy, rock n' roll style recording process that was experienced in making the single, and album. Within the clip, various instruments are seen, such as an electric guitar, a piano, and a drum kit, standing as the quite literal symbols for the Justice progression into a more rocky, less electronic sound. Several songs from this album have been used in the second series of the Channel 4 comedy [[Cardinal Burns]].

In March 2012, the band played mainstage at [[Ultra Music Festival]] in Miami, Florida. The duo played many of its hits from its critically acclaimed debut album ''[[Cross (Justice album)|Cross]]'', as well as many of the new tracks off of ''[[Audio, Video, Disco]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmlounge.com/blog/2012/4/8/review-justice-at-ultra-music-festival.html|title=Review: Justice at Ultra Music Festival - Blog - EDM Lounge - Electronic Dance Music, News, and Reviews|website=Edmlounge.com|access-date=28 January 2018}}</ref> In April 2012, Justice was also a headlining act at [[Coachella Valley Music Festival]] in Indio, California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmlounge.com/blog/2012/4/14/coachella-2012-sunday-preview.html|title=Coachella 2012 Sunday Preview - Blog - EDM Lounge - Electronic Dance Music, News, and Reviews|website=Edmlounge.com|access-date=28 January 2018}}</ref> Justice headlined at Montreal's [[Osheaga]] on 3 August 2012 and Chicago's Lollapalooza on Sunday, 5 August. Justice also played at San Francisco's [[Outside Lands Music Festival]] on Friday, 10 August. In October 2012, the band played at [[Voodoo Experience]] in New Orleans, Louisiana. Justice completed its world tour of the live show on 10 November 2012 playing at One Festival in Mexico City, Mexico.

On 7 May 2013, the band released its second live album, ''[[Access All Arenas]]'', which was recorded at the [[Arena of Nîmes]] in France on 19 July 2012.

===''Woman'' (2014–2018)===
On 22 June 2014, the band announced that they had started working on a third album.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.festivalrykten.se/justice-jobbar-pa-nytt-album/ |title=Justice jobbar på nytt album |website=Festivalrykten.se |access-date=28 January 2018 |language=sv}}</ref> On 12 April 2016, [[Because Music]] revealed that Justice was in the process of signing record release documents.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=becausemusic|author=Because Music|number=719889495076773889|date=12 April 2016|title=On our way to new adventures with these boys 🙌🏻 #Justice @edbangerrecords}}</ref> On 18 June 2016, a new single was revealed titled "[[Safe and Sound (Justice song)|Safe and Sound]]" at the [[Ed Banger]] House Party at the [[Sónar]] 2016 Music Festival.

==Musical style and equipment==
Apart from the disco and funk influences of electro house, Justice's style has some heavy metal influence.<ref>Chinen, Nate (22 October 2007). [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/22/arts/music/22just.html "To Everything (Churn, Churn, Churn) There’s Techno"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref> Justice combines cut-up or slapped basslines with compressed and distorted synth sounds.

Each of the studio albums have had an accompanying live tour, with each having its own unique live equipment setup. The equipment has changed from tour to tour, but has remained centered on [[Ableton Live]].

On each side of "Valentine" (a non-functional [[modular synthesizer]] prop) are nine stacked Marshall cabinet fronts, adding up to a total of 18.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://createdigitalmusic.com/2008/10/02/behind-the-scenes-with-justice-in-rio/|title=Behind the Scenes with Justice in Rio - CDM Create Digital Music|date=2 October 2008|website=Createdigitalmusic.com|access-date=28 January 2018}}</ref> The cabinet stacks are another nonfunctional prop that serve as stage dressing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/01/arts/music/01herm.html|title=French Electronic Dance Music|first=Will|last=Hermes|date=1 July 2007|website=Nytimes.com|access-date=28 January 2018}}</ref> Their DJ setup previously included two Pioneer [[CDJ]]-1000MK3s and a Pioneer DJM800,<ref name="digitaldj">{{cite web |url = http://digitaldj.wordpress.com/2008/09/17/justice-electro-music-with-punk-attitude/ |title = Justice – Electro Music With Punk Attitude|website=Digitaldj.wordpress.com|date = 17 September 2008|access-date=28 January 2018}}</ref> but since the ''A Cross the Universe'' release tour, Justice have been using [[Ableton Live]] controlled by an AKAI MPD24 and a Pioneer DJM800 for their DJ sets.

=== ''Access All Arenas'' Tour ===
On the ''Access All Arenas'' tour, which accompanied the release of ''Audio, Video, Disco'', Justice's live setup expanded to make use of more intricate lighting effects. The addition of this new set lighting was made with the artistic constraint that no video screens be used.<ref name=":0">{{Citation|last=JAY Z's Life+Times|title=The Blueprint - Justice|date=25 March 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk3SHyYGc38|access-date=8 March 2018}}</ref> The lighting involved a stripped-down, bold use of basic colors, so as to distract minimally from musical performance itself.<ref name=":0" />

The audio equipment was also stripped down to an Ableton Live console, multiple Pioneer DJM800s for the mixing suite on-stage, a Minimoog Voyager, and a minimal number of other MIDI controllers.<ref name=":0" /> A 76-key keyboard was concealed within "Valentine" (still the prominently featured centerpiece of the stage), which was revealed at points during the show in which Gaspard or Xavier would play certain piano or organ portions of the setlist.

=== ''Woman World Wide'' Tour ===
The ''Woman World Wide'' tour, promoting the release of the ''Woman'' studio album, marked another evolution of the live show to include more intricate stage lighting, employing minimal video effects and moving lighting fixtures, while remaining true to the refusal to rely on video or lighting effects as the primary focus of performance. The ''Woman World Wide'' tour would be the first tour not using "Valentine" as the center of the stage.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BagHleujLwI/|title=JUSTICE on Instagram: "Same pic, different angle @dasshitcrray"|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=8 March 2018}}</ref> However, the signature cross motif was incorporated into the lighting suite.<ref name=":1" />

The audio rig for ''Woman World Wide'' incorporated a wide number of analog synthesizers, involving seemingly more manual performance and interaction from Justice themselves. The ''Woman World Wide'' equipment included two Moog Sub Phattys, two Moog Voyagers (one XL), a Roland TB-3 and TB-03, an Akai LPD-8, among other miscellaneous effects pedals, MIDI keyboards, and control surfaces - some appearing to be custom-made.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BTUCVfcji2i/|title=JUSTICE on Instagram: "Behind the scene Coachella '17 @pascalteixeira"|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=8 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BS7kVJLDgUA/|title=JUSTICE on Instagram: "Living room rehearsals in Palm Springs @coachella"|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=8 March 2018}}</ref> A Native Instruments Kontrol S-series keyboard was also seen used in the televised performance at AccorHotels Arena in Paris, France.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arte.tv/fr/videos/078753-002-A/justice-a-l-accorhotels-arena/|title=Justice à l'AccorHotels Arena {{!}} ARTE Concert|website=ARTE|language=fr|access-date=8 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309054201/https://www.arte.tv/fr/videos/078753-002-A/justice-a-l-accorhotels-arena/|archive-date=9 March 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Following the previous pattern of using Pioneer DJM series mixers, the ''Woman World Tour'' set also used four DJM900s.

In March 2019, the band introduced ''IRIS: A Space Opera by Justice'', a 60-minute film of a live show recorded in an empty space without an audience. The film premiered at [[South by Southwest]] on March 13,<ref>{{cite web |author1=Kat Bein |title=Justice Teases 'IRIS: A Space Opera' Live Film to Premiere at SXSW |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/8496974/justice-iris-a-space-opera-live-film-sxsw-2019 |website=Billboard}}</ref> while a single projection in French theaters screened on August 29.
