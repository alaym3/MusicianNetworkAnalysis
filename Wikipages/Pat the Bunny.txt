'''''Pat the Bunny''''' is a "touch and feel" book for small children and babies and has been a perennial [[best-seller]] in the United States since its publication in [[1940 in literature|1940]]. It is not a book in the traditional sense, but more a collection of things to do, such as pat the fake fur of a [[rabbit]] on one page, feel a bit of sandpaper that stands for "daddy's scratchy face" on another, and look in a mirror on yet another.

It was written and illustrated by [[Dorothy Kunhardt]], who was a successful children's author when she created ''Pat the Bunny'' for her 3-year-old daughter, Edith.<ref>{{cite web | author=Schiro, Anne-Marie| date= July 29, 1984| title= COMPANION FOR A CHILDREN'S CLASSIC | format= | work=[[New York Times]]| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9501E2DA1F39F93AA15754C0A962948260 | accessdate=2006-06-18}}</ref> It was partly an experiment in using [[interactive]] elements in a book, which was unusual at the time.<ref name="sales">{{cite web | author=PHILIP B.
