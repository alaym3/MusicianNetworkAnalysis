'''Vanity 6''' was an American female vocal trio assembled by American musician [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] in mid-1981.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/6875318/vanity-denise-katrina-matthews-prince-vanity-6-dies-at-57|title=Vanity, Former Prince Protégé & Leader of The Hookers, Dies at 57|website=Billboard|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref>

==Background==

===Formation===
In 1981, Prince, himself a rising musical star, suggested that his three female friends—his girlfriend [[Susan Moonsie]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] native [[Brenda Bennett]], and Jamie Shoop—form a [[girl group]] that would be called "The Hookers". Prince's vision was that the three women would perform in lingerie and sing sensual songs with lyrics about sex, romance and fantasy. Prince had been wanting to mentor a girl singer or group since the late 1970s when he saw the film ''[[A Star Is Born (1976 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' with [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Kris Kristofferson]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

The original trio recorded a few [[Demo (music)|demos]] before Prince met [[Vanity (singer)|Denise Matthews]], a model and Canadian [[B movie]] actress, in January 1981. Matthews was [[Rick James]]'s date at the [[American Music Award|American Music Awards]] when Prince persuaded her to join his girl group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/from-the-pitchfork-review/9731-do-it-all-night-the-story-of-princes-dirty-mind/|title=Do It All Night: The Story of Prince's Dirty Mind {{!}} Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-04}}</ref> Prince was so taken by her charisma that he decided she would be the perfect frontwoman for his "Hookers" project. Matthews was eventually re-christened [[Vanity (singer)|Vanity]]. Prince had originally suggested that she use the stage name "Vagina", but instead they agreed upon "Vanity".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20088910,00.html|title=Her Romance with Prince Hit the Rocks, but Vanity's Singing Career Is Going Grrr-Eat|website=People.com|date=15 October 1984}}</ref> Other versions of the story suggest that it was Prince himself who coined the name "Vanity", as he said that looking at her was like looking in a mirror at the female version of himself. Around this time, Prince and Vanity began a romantic relationship. With Vanity's arrival, Shoop was dropped from the group.

==Career==
With the new trio finalized, Prince renamed the group Vanity 6. He provided the group, now dressed in lingerie and high heels, with provocative songs (although within the album credits, group members were sometimes given sole writing credits). Their first single, "He's So Dull", was a minor hit in Australia<ref name=aus>{{cite book|last=Kent|first=David|author-link=David Kent (historian)|title=Australian Chart Book 1970–1992|publisher=Australian Chart Book|location=St. Ives, N.S.W.|year=1993|edition=Illustrated|page=320|isbn=0-646-11917-6}}</ref> and the Netherlands,<ref name=ned>{{cite web|url=http://dutchcharts.nl/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Vanity+6|title=dutchcharts.nl > Discografie Vanity 6|language=nl|publisher=Hung Medien|access-date=2016-02-20}}</ref> and appeared in the film ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]''. The second single, "[[Nasty Girl (Vanity 6 song)|Nasty Girl]]", was a hit on both the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|U.S. R&B]] chart, peaking at number 7, and [[Hot Dance Club Play|U.S. Dance]] chart (where it hit number one), and it also made an appearance on the [[Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles]] chart.<ref>{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p21236|label=Vanity}}</ref> "Nasty Girl" was a top 10 hit in the Netherlands,<ref name=ned/> and a top 20 hit in the Flanders region of Belgium.<ref name=bel>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultratop.be/nl/song/20c99/Vanity-6-Nasty-Girl|title=Ultratop > Vanity 6 – Nasty Girl|language=nl|publisher=Hung Medien|access-date=2016-02-20}}</ref> The song was featured in the film ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'', although it was not included on the soundtrack. "Nasty Girl" was also featured in the 1983 sex comedy ''[[Private School (film)|Private School]]''. During the group's existence, members sometimes provided backing vocals on Prince's albums.

===Dissension and dissolution===
The third single, "Drive Me Wild", was another minor hit. [[Music video]]s were shot for all three singles.  Their self-titled album, ''[[Vanity 6 (album)|Vanity 6]]'' (which would turn out to be their only release) was eventually certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold]]. The group opened up on the [[1999 Tour]], between 1982 and 1983, which also featured [[The Time (band)|The Time]] and Prince, as the headliner. The fact that The Time played behind a curtain during the Vanity 6 performance, caused a rift between the bands and friction within those friendships.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

To the other group members' dismay, Prince chose Vanity to pose with him for a [[Richard Avedon]] photograph used on the cover of an issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. The issue also contained a two-page Avedon photo of Vanity 6. In 1983, Vanity recorded a demo for a new song, "Sex Shooter", and started reading for her lead role in ''[[Purple Rain (film)|Purple Rain]]'' opposite Prince. Prior to the shooting of the movie, later in 1983, Vanity abruptly decided to leave the Prince camp and relinquish her role in the film. Many reasons were given for her sudden departure, including money, the end of their romantic relationship, and, most importantly, Vanity having been offered a lucrative solo deal from [[Motown Records]].

==Apollonia 6==
Vanity was replaced in ''Purple Rain'' by [[Apollonia Kotero|Patricia Kotero]], who would adopt the stage name Apollonia. She also inherited the lead role in Vanity 6, which was renamed [[Apollonia 6]], alongside Bennett and Moonsie. The new trio recorded what would be their only album, ''[[Apollonia 6 (album)|Apollonia 6]]'' in 1984.

==Later life==
In 1994, former front woman Vanity overdosed on crack cocaine and suffered from near-fatal [[kidney failure]]. Upon recovering, she renounced her stage name and music and became a [[Born again Christianity|born again Christian]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Rettenmund|first=Matthew |title=Totally Awesome 80s: A Lexicon Of the Music, Videos, Movies, TV shows, Stars, and Trends Of That Decadent Decade|publisher=Macmillan|year=1996|pages=57|isbn=0-312-14436-9}}</ref> Vanity died on February 15, 2016 &ndash; aged 57 &ndash; from [[sclerosis (medicine)|sclerosing]] encapsulating [[peritonitis]], a complex form of a kidney disease.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://globalgrind.cassiuslife.com/4147805/denise-vanity-matthews-vanity-6-dead-at-57/|title=Denise "Vanity" Matthews Of Vanity 6 Dead At 57|date=February 16, 2016|website=Globalgrind.cassiuslife.com|access-date=June 20, 2019}}</ref>

==Unreleased second Vanity 6 album==
{{Unreferenced|section|date=April 2020}}
A number of songs were intended for the Vanity 6 follow up album, but due to Vanity's departure, these songs ended up performed by others.
* "[[Sex Shooter]]" was released by [[Apollonia 6]]. Vanity 6 did record at least one version of this song which has been leaked on the internet extensively. The arrangement on this version is sparse and somewhat loose in performance which may indicate that this version was merely a rehearsal or demo version.
* "[[17 Days (song)|17 Days]]", the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] to Prince's "[[When Doves Cry]]", ended up being released by Prince, with Bennett's background vocals still on the recording.
* "G-Spot", which ended up on Jill Jones debut album.  The Vanity 6/Prince with Jill Jones background vocals demo has been leaked on the internet as well.
* "Vibrator", which has been leaked extensively online. This song features [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] in a comedic sketch as well as [[Jill Jones]]. The song is about Vanity feeling ignored by her lover only to find solace with her (actual quote from the song) "[[Vibrator (sex toy)|body massager]]" which midway through the song loses power prompting Vanity to go purchase batteries at two  different stores. The song is set in three distinct parts: 1) verse and chorus portions then 2) the comedic sketch and finally 3) Vanity achieving an orgasm with her vibrator.
* "[[Manic Monday]]", which Prince offered to and was eventually recorded by [[The Bangles]] for their album ''[[Different Light]]''.
