'''Jerrold Lewis Bock''' (November 23, 1928{{spaced ndash}}November 3, 2010) was an American [[musical theater]] [[composer]]. He received the [[Tony Award for Best Musical]] and the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] with [[Sheldon Harnick]] for their 1959 musical ''[[Fiorello!]]'' and the Tony Award for Best Composer and Lyricist for the 1964 musical ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' with Sheldon Harnick.

==Biography==
Born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], and raised in [[Flushing, Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]], Bock studied the [[piano]] as a child. While a student at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], he wrote the musical ''Big As Life'', which toured the state and enjoyed a run in [[Chicago]]. After graduation, he spent three summers at the Tamiment Playhouse in the [[Pocono Mountains|Poconos]] and wrote for early [[television]] revues with lyricist [[Larry Holofcener]]. One of their songs, the three-part "The Story of Alice," was performed by the [[Chad Mitchell Trio]] on their ''[[Blowin' in the Wind]]'' album of 1962.<ref>Ginell, Cary, AllMusic Review of the Chad Mitchell Trio's ''Blowin' in the Wind,'' ''AllMusic'', https://www.allmusic.com/album/blowin-in-the-wind-mw0000595778</ref>

===Career===
Bock made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in 1955 when he and [[Lawrence Holofcener]] contributed songs to ''Catch a Star''. The following year the duo collaborated on the musical ''[[Mr. Wonderful (musical)|Mr. Wonderful]]'', designed for [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], after which they worked on ''Ziegfeld Follies of 1956'', which closed out-of-town.<ref>[http://digilib.nypl.org/dynaweb/ead/music/musbock/@Generic__BookView Guide to the Jerry Bock Papers, 1945-2004]</ref>

Shortly after, Bock met lyricist [[Sheldon Harnick]], with whom he forged a successful partnership. Although their first joint venture, ''[[The Body Beautiful]]'', failed to charm the critics, its score caught the attention of director [[George Abbott]] and producer [[Harold Prince|Hal Prince]].  They hired the team to compose a musical biography of former [[New York City]] mayor [[Fiorello La Guardia]]. ''[[Fiorello!]]'' (1959) earned Bock and Harnick the [[New York Drama Critics' Circle|New York Drama Critics' Circle Award]] for Best Musical, Tony Award for Best Musical (tied with the team from ''[[The Sound of Music]]'') and the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]].

Bock's additional collaborations with Harnick include ''[[Tenderloin (musical)|Tenderloin]]'' (1960), ''Man in the Moon'' (1963), ''[[She Loves Me]]'' (1963), ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' (1964), ''[[The Apple Tree]]'' (1966), and ''[[The Rothschilds (musical)|The Rothschilds]]'' (1970), as well as contributions to ''[[Never Too Late (play)|Never Too Late]]'' (1962), ''[[Baker Street (musical)|Baker Street]]'' (1965), ''[[Her First Roman]]'' (1968), and ''[[The Madwoman of Central Park West]]'' (1979). ''Fiddler on the Roof'' included the hit song "[[If I Were a Rich Man (song)|If I Were a Rich Man]]".

Established in 1997, the Jerry Bock Award for Excellence in Musical Theater is an annual grant presented to the composer and lyricist of a project developed in the [[BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theater Workshop]].<ref>[http://www.bmifoundation.org/pages/JBock.asp Bock listing] bmifoundation.org</ref>

Bock spoke at the funeral of 98-year-old Fiddler playwright [[Joseph Stein]] just 10 days before his own death, from heart failure at 81, less than three weeks before his 82nd birthday.<ref name="death">{{cite web|title=FIDDLER Composer Jerry Bock Dies at 81|url=http://broadwayworld.com/article/FIDDLER_Composer_Jerry_Bock_Dies_at_81_20101103|publisher=broadwayworld.com|access-date=3 November 2010}}</ref>
