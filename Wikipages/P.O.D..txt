== History ==

=== Early years (1991–1993) ===

In 1991, friends [[Noah Bernardo|Wuv Bernardo]] and [[Marcos Curiel]] engaged in [[jam session]]s, with Bernardo playing the drums and Curiel covering guitar with no vocalist.<ref>{{cite web |last=Anonymous |title=''P.O.D.'' |publisher=San Diego Reader |access-date=December 11, 2009 |url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/bands/pod/}}</ref> Calling themselves ''Eschatos'', they started playing at keg parties doing [[Metallica]] and [[Slayer]] cover songs.

After his mother's fatal illness, [[Sonny Sandoval]] converted to Christianity and was asked by Bernardo, his cousin, to join the band as a way to keep his mind straight as mentioned on their [[DVD]], ''[[Still Payin' Dues]]''. They then recruited bassist Gabe Portillo and eventually changed their name to P.O.D.

=== Snuff the Punk and Brown (1994–1998) ===
{{main|Snuff the Punk|Brown (P.O.D. album)}}
After recording a demo tape, [[Traa Daniels]] joined the band in 1994 when they needed a bassist for some shows to replace Portillo. P.O.D. signed with [[Rescue Records]], a label created by Bernardo's father, Noah Bernardo Sr., who was also the band's first manager.<ref name="hitquarters2004">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_TimCook_int.html |title=Interview with Tim Cook |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=May 3, 2004 |access-date=October 11, 2011}}</ref> Between 1994 and 1997, they released three albums under the label, ''[[Snuff the Punk]]'', ''[[Brown (P.O.D. album)|Brown]]'' and ''[[Payable on Death Live]]''.<ref name="P.O.D. Biography" /> Longtime manager Tim Cook was first introduced to the band when he booked them to play his club The Where-House in [[Bartlesville, Oklahoma]] following strong local [[word of mouth]] support.<ref name="hitquarters2004"/> He later described their performance by saying: "I stood at the back of the venue with tears in my eyes – it was the greatest thing I had ever seen."<ref name="hitquarters2004"/> By that point, Bernardo Sr. was looking for someone else to take P.O.D.'s career further and so Cook took over as manager.<ref name="hitquarters2004"/>

Shortly after the release of ''Payable on Death Live'', [[Essential Records (Christian)|Essential Records]] offered P.O.D. a $100,000 recording contract, but on behalf of the band Sandoval told band manager Tim Cook to decline the offer because, "God has a bigger plan for P.O.D."<ref name="Promotion Crew: P.O.D.

{{main|The Fundamental Elements of Southtown|Satellite (P.O.D. album)}}
P.O.D.'s third studio album, 1999's ''[[The Fundamental Elements of Southtown]]'', spawned the hits "[[Southtown (P.O.D. song)|Southtown]]" and "[[Rock the Party (Off the Hook)]]", which was their first video to reach No.&nbsp;1 on MTV's ''[[Total Request Live]]''.<ref name="Rock the Party hits No.&nbsp;1">{{cite web |url=http://www.atrl.net/trlarchive/?s=recap&y=2000&m=07 |title=Rock the Party hits No.&nbsp;1 |access-date=January 4, 2008 |author=Absolute TRL staff |work=ATRL.net }}</ref> The song "[[School of Hard Knocks (song)|School of Hard Knocks]]" was featured on the soundtrack for ''[[Little Nicky]]'' while both "Southtown" and "Rock the Party" appeared in the movie.

It was described by Curiel as "Back to our roots. A little bit of hip hop, a little bit of punk rock, or reggae".<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|last=Darby |first=Heidi |url=http://www.lifeabove11.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=107:pod-interview&catid=39:interviews |title=POD and Norma Lopez |publisher=Lifeabove11.com |date=September 17, 2010 |access-date=July 6, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405224046/http://www.lifeabove11.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=107:pod-interview&catid=39:interviews |archive-date=April 5, 2011}}</ref> The album caused controversy concerning its eleventh track, "I Am", which uses the word "fuck" (albeit backmasked). Sandoval, explaining the purpose of the song, said, "Being up close and personal with these kids, that's what came out in that song. I'm a man of faith and I'm a follower and a believer of Jesus Christ, and in talking to these kids, and even in talking to people just throughout my career in P.O.D., a lot of these bands and athletes and all these people that you meet, they don't have a problem with Jesus. They have a problem with people that are religious and claim to know Jesus, but aren't living it or acting it and aren't loving the way Jesus did. In my faith, if I believe that Jesus paid for the sins of the world, and I'm all these things, this is what's going on in the real world, and do you still love someone like me? And even though I know you do, and I believe in you, I believe in your forgiveness and your grace and your mercy, there's still so much confusion around me that everybody's getting in the way and trying to take your place. Everything gets in my way from seeing who Jesus was...We had that song for almost a year, and I didn't take it lightly. I'd been praying on it for over a year. I'd actually took counsel and let people hear it. And it was 50/50. Some people are like, you know what, go for it. Because my heart is like, I don't write music for Christians. I don't write music for people that I believe are saved and going to heaven. If it's a breath of you and encourages you and gives you a sense of power to go balls out for what you believe in, then by all means. But ultimately we're trying to reach people fed up with religion that are sick and tired of it, and people that are in the real world that really are lost and confused. Our music has always been a tool to bring hope to those people. I'm sorry we can't please everybody in the church, but ultimately in our faith, I believe you're taken care of. There are a lot of people that live in the real world that are out on the streets, that are prostituting themselves, that are being sexually abused, that are being murdered and killed, and it's an evil world. And sometimes you've got to just give them the truth flat out. And it might offend some people. Might offend a lot of people. But at the end of the day, if they understand it and they get it, and they allow God to speak straight into their soul, then I think it's worth the slap on the hand."<ref>https://www.songfacts.com/facts/pod/i-am</ref> The band went on tour with [[Shinedown]] and [[Three Days Grace]] as an opening act.

In a 2012 interview with ''Broken Records Magazine'', Sandoval said that the band had to get their lives back in order and take care of personal needs before getting back into music, but was extremely happy about the response the band was getting from fans.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

== Musical style and influences ==

The band's name, Payable on Death (P.O.D.), derives itself from the banking term "[[Totten trust|Payable on Death]]". The band chose this name to be a direct tie in with the Christian theology that explains that [[Atonement in Christianity|since Jesus died on the Cross, Christians' debts to God have been paid for]]; in other words all believers, in their acceptance that Jesus was sacrificed for them on God's behalf, have inherited eternal life. P.O.D.'s style has evolved over the years, from the [[rap metal]] sound on their early albums to the [[nu metal]] and [[reggae]]-infused [[alternative metal]] styles for which they're most well known.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} The band's seventh album, ''[[When Angels & Serpents Dance]]'', is a combination of [[alternative rock]], [[reggae rock]] and Latin-influenced metal with almost none of the rap metal or nu metal sound of their older releases. P.O.D.'s influences include [[Boogie Down Productions]], [[Run-DMC]], [[U2]], [[the Police (band)|the Police]], [[Bad Brains]], [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Metallica]], [[AC/DC]], [[Suicidal Tendencies]], [[Bob Marley]], [[Primus (band)|Primus]], [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], [[24-7 Spyz]], and [[Steel Pulse]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thehypemagazine.com/2015/01/01/the-hype-magazine-interviews-sonny-sandoval-of-p-o-d-payable-on-death-heart-soul-music/ |title=The Hype Magazine interviews Sonny Sandoval of P.O.D.
