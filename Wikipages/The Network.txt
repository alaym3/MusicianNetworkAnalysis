==History==

Formed in the Summer of 2003, the band consisted of lead vocalist [[Billie Joe Armstrong|Fink]], bassist [[Mike Dirnt|Van Gough]], and drummer [[TrÃ© Cool|Snoo]], as well as additional members Captain Underpants and Z on keyboards and rhythm guitarist Balducci.<ref name="AMB">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-network-mn0000477806/biography|title=The Network â€“ Biography & History â€“ AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}</reF> They claimed they were "brought together by an ancient prophecy".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/46067/green-day-unmasked|title=Green Day Unmasked?|date=October 16, 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2003-10-03-0310040002-story.html|title=Has Green Day gone incognito?|first=Chicago|last=Tribune}}</ref>

The band's debut album ''[[Money Money 2020]]'' was released in September 2003 on Green Day singer [[Billie Joe Armstrong]]'s record label [[Adeline Records]]. The Network concealed their identities by using accents and wearing masks.<ref name="UNF">{{cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/features/11_of_green_days_most_unforgettable_moments/|title=11 of Green Day's most unforgettable moments â€“ Alternative Press|date=September 26, 2016}}</ref>  They frequently released press statements denouncing Green Day.<ref name="AMB"/>

''Money Money 2020'' was re-mastered and re-released by Reprise Records on November 9, 2004, with two additional tracks, "Hammer of the Gods" and a cover of [[Misfits (band)|The Misfits]] "[[Teenagers from Mars]]", which can also be heard on ''[[Tony Hawk's American Wasteland]]'' while "Roshambo" is on the ''[[NHL 2005]]'' soundtrack. The original ''Money Money 2020'' release came with a companion DVD with music videos directed and produced by Roy Miles of AntiDivision.

In October 2005, the group opened for Green Day for several shows.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1510964/are-green-day-their-own-worst-enemy-only-time-or-concerts-will-tell/|title=Are Green Day Their Own Worst Enemy?

In October 2020, after 15 years of inactivity, the band released a teaser trailer entitled "The Prophecy".

===Identities===

At the time, Armstrong denied the involvement of any Green Day members in The Network, saying "All I gotta say is fuck The Network. These guys are totally spreading rumors."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Boone|first1=Brian|title=I love rock 'n' roll (except when I hate it) : extremely important stuff about the songs and bands you love, hate, love to hate, and hate to love|date=2011|publisher=Perigee|location=New York|isbn=9781101507919|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CT_ViUaYTfwC|access-date=October 19, 2017}}</ref>
