== History ==
=== 2017: Formation ===
The ten-episode season of the American television music competition series ''[[Boy Band (TV series)|Boy Band]]'' began with thirty young male vocalists competing to become a member of the new five-member boy band. Each week, the boys would rotate into different groups and perform, at the end, the "architects" would put either two or three boys up for elimination and through live voting, a boy would be chosen by America to be saved. At the end of the season, the five remaining boys would form the boy band and receive a recording contract with [[Hollywood Records]].<ref name="variety1"/> After a 24-hour voting period the week before, it was announced at the final live show on August 24, 2017 that Tutton, Perez, Ramos, Calderon and Smith were the winning members, thus forming the boy band In Real Life and performing their debut single, "Eyes Closed".
