==Early life==

Sudol and both parents moved to Los Angeles after their divorce, when she was five.<ref>{{Cite web |author=Cardoni, Salvatore |date=October 4, 2012 |title=Not in My Backyard: 94-Year-Old Retired Marine Corps Colonel Fights Proposed Strip Mine |publisher=Takepart |url=http://www.takepart.com/article/2012/10/03/not-my-backyard-94-year-old-retired-marine-corps-colonel-fights-strip-mine |access-date=July 10, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710181402/http://www.takepart.com/article/2012/10/03/not-my-backyard-94-year-old-retired-marine-corps-colonel-fights-strip-mine |archive-date=July 10, 2015 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> She grew up listening to a wide range of music, including [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], and [[swing music|swing]].<ref name="ellegirl.elle.com">{{cite web |url=http://ellegirl.elle.com/entertainment/new_music/content/a_fine_frenzy/a_fine_frenzy_interview__1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509204534/http://ellegirl.elle.com/entertainment/new_music/content/a_fine_frenzy/a_fine_frenzy_interview__1.html |title=ELLEgirl |archive-date=May 9, 2008|work=Elle}}</ref> She cites [[Bob Dylan]], [[Johnny Cash]], and [[Simon and Garfunkel]] as some of her biggest musical influences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lamusicblog.com/2009/09/interview/interview-with-alison-of-a-fine-frenzy/|title=Interview with Alison Sudol of A Fine Frenzy {{!}} LA Music Blog|website=lamusicblog.com|access-date=February 22, 2018}}</ref>

She graduated from high school at 16, and considered herself "nerdy and quiet". She did not "drink or smoke or do anything like that". She stated in an interview, "I was so nervous about going into college like that and super young. I figured I would take two years and try to find out what I was doing with music. And when I was 18, I was just so deep into it that I didn't want to stop."<ref name="ellegirl.elle.com"/>

Sudol had a passion for literature, and immersed herself in the works of [[C. S. Lewis]], [[E. B. White]], [[Lewis Carroll]], [[Anthony Trollope]], and [[Charles Dickens]]. Her band's name, "A Fine Frenzy", is taken from a verse in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'': "The poet's eye, in ''a fine frenzy'' rolling, doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven" (Act 5, Scene 1). After teaching herself to play the piano, she began putting her creative energy into writing songs.

A short demo she sent out received attention from [[EMI]]'s [[Jason Flom]], who signed her after visiting her house and "listening to her play".<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=a fine frenzy|bio=true}} Biography & Awards], Billboard.com</ref>
