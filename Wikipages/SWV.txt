==Biography==

===Early life and big break===
[[File:It's About Time (SWV album).jpeg|thumb|SWV It's About Time album cover]]
SWV (an abbreviation for '''S'''isters '''W'''ith '''V'''oices) was formed by [[Coko|Cheryl "Coko" Gamble]], [[Tamara Johnson-George|Tamara "Taj" Johnson]] and [[Leanne "Lelee" Lyons]] (with Lelee and Coko as founding members).<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.swvonline.com/lelee.htm|title = All about Leanne "Lelee" Lyons|quote = With her love for singing, and sparse support from her family as motivation, Lelee's desires to put together a group were fueled but success did not come easily.|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091202100603/http://www.swvonline.com/lelee.htm|archive-date = 2009-12-02}}</ref> After getting their demo together, their manager at the time, Maureen Singleton sent out demo tapes along with bottles of Perrier ("We couldn't afford champagne", says Taj) to catch the attention of record execs all over America. In 1991, after being invited to sing live in front of RCA executives, SWV was signed to an eight-album record deal. 

===1992–1995: ''It's About Time'' and ''The Remixes''===
''[[It's About Time (SWV album)|It's About Time]]'', the debut studio album by SWV, was released by [[RCA Records]] on October 27, 1992 (see [[1992 in music]]). It was certified [[RIAA certification|multi platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] for more than two million copies shipped to store.<ref name=mtv>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/swv/artist.jhtml|title=SWV Biography|publisher=mtv.com|access-date=2008-08-01}}</ref>
SWV's first single, "[[Right_Here_(SWV_song)|Right Here]]", was released in the fall of 1992, reaching No. 13 on the R&B charts. Their second single, "[[I'm So into You]]", peaked at No. 2 on R&B and reached No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100. The third single, "[[Weak (SWV song)|Weak]]", reached No. 1 on both the R&B and Hot 100 charts. "[[Right Here/Human Nature]]", the fourth single and a remix of their first single, "Right Here", featured samples of [[Michael Jackson]]'s hit "[[Human Nature (Michael Jackson song)|Human Nature]]". [[Pharrell Williams]] performed a small rap solo on "Right Here (UK Remix)". "Right Here/Human Nature" peaked at No. 1 on R&B and No. 2 on the Hot 100 and it stayed at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' R&B charts for 7 weeks, making it one of the longest-running singles of 1993. It was followed up with the additional Top10 R&B hits, "Downtown" (No. 2), and "You're Always on My Mind" (No. 8).<ref name=mtv /><ref name="billboard">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=swv|chart=all}}|title=SWV: Billboard chart history|publisher=billboard.com}}</ref> The album peaked at 8 on the US Billboard 200. Following the success of their first album, SWV appeared on the soundtrack for the 1994 film ''[[Above the Rim]]''. The single, "Anything", became a top ten R&B hit and reached No. 18 on the Hot 100 in the spring of 1994. That same year, SWV released ''[[The Remixes (SWV album)|The Remixes]]'', which went gold by the end of the year. In the summer of 1995, the trio lent vocal harmonies to [[Blackstreet]]'s Top 40 R&B hit "Tonight's the Night".

===1996–1997: ''New Beginning'', ''Release Some Tension'' and ''A Special Christmas''===
''[[New Beginning (SWV album)|New Beginning]]'' was the second album from SWV. The first single, "[[You're the One (SWV song)|You're the One]]", became one of their signature songs peaking at number five on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and topped the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles]] chart. The second single, "Use Your Heart", saw the debut of the super producers [[The Neptunes]]. This song peaked at twenty-two on the Hot 100 and number six on the R&B chart. The last single, "It's All About U", found Taj taking most of the lead as opposed to Coko. The album was certified platinum for shipping 1,000,000 copies in the U.S. alone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS |title=Recording Industry Association of America |publisher=RIAA |access-date=2012-04-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225031458/http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS |archive-date=2013-02-25 }}</ref> Also, in 1995 SWV appeared on the ''[[Waiting to Exhale: Original Soundtrack Album]]'', recording the track, "All Night Long".

''[[Release Some Tension]]'' is SWV's third album. Guest appearances are made by [[E-40]], [[Sean Combs|Puff Daddy]], [[Missy Elliott]], [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]], [[Lil' Cease]], [[Lil' Kim]], [[Snoop Dogg|Snoop Doggy Dogg]], and [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]].

"Someone", although featuring one of the biggest producers/artists of the year, Puff Daddy, only reached No. 19 on the ''Billboard'' charts which sampled [[The Notorious B.I.G.]]'s "Ten Crack Commandment's and [[Les McCann]]'s "Valantra". "When U Cry" also sampled [[Tyrone Davis]]' "In The Mood". The album was certified gold for shipping 500,000 copies in the U.S. alone. [https://web.archive.org/web/20130225031458/http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS RIAA Database] ''A Special Christmas'', a holiday album featuring both cover versions and original material, was released in the United States on November 18, 1997, by [[RCA Records]]. ''A Special Christmas'' would be the penultimate album the trio recorded together before they disbanded in 1998. [[Coko]], the group's lead singer, released her first solo album in 1999.

===1998–2010: Hiatus and reuniting of SWV===
The group split in 1998. The members began leading their own careers. After SWV disbanded, Coko went on to release her first solo album under [[RCA Records|RCA]], titled ''Hot Coko'', released August 1999. The first single, "Sunshine", which was dedicated to her son Jazz, reached the Top 40 position in the R&B charts that summer. However, neither the album nor the singles gathered the same mainstream success as Coko once did with SWV. Meanwhile, Coko was working on a second solo album titled ''Music Doll'' in early 2001, but RCA closed the black music division and the project was shelved. Since then, she has concentrated more on her family, and eventually married gospel producer and drummer for [[Israel and New Breed]], Mike "Big Mike" Clemmons, the father of her second son, Jaylon. She currently resides in Virginia Beach, Virginia.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}} In 2001, Coko and her Mother Lady "Clyde" Tibba Gamble did a remake of the song "[[Tears in Heaven]]" (originally recorded by [[Eric Clapton]]) on the album ''Rhythm and Spirit: "Love Can Build a Bridge"''. The album featured other artists such as [[Jennifer Holliday]], [[Patti Labelle]], and [[Tramaine Hawkins]]. Clemons sang on the Brent Jones & TP Mobb single "Midnite" in 2002. She also appeared on Youthful Praise's 2003 gospel album ''Thank You for the Change'' singing lead on "Up There".

Coko's full gospel solo debut, ''Grateful'', was released in the United States on October 31, 2006<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gospelflava.com/articles/cokointerview2006.html |title=Interview with Coko: A New Beginning|publisher=GospelFlava.com}}</ref> and debuted at No. 5 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Top Independent albums chart.<ref name="cokono5">{{cite web|url=http://www.gospelcity.com/dynamic/industry-articles/industry_news/345 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130103025653/http://www.gospelcity.com/dynamic/industry-articles/industry_news/345 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-01-03 |title=Coko Debuts At No. 5 On Billboard Chart |date=2006-11-08 |publisher=GospelCity.com }}</ref> ''Grateful'' includes an all-star cover of [[The Clark Sisters]]' "Endow Me" which features R&B singers [[Faith Evans]], [[Fantasia Barrino]] and [[Lil Mo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gospelflava.com/reviews/coko.html|title=Grateful Album Review|author=Bonner, Gerald|publisher=GospelFlava.com}}</ref> An alternate version, minus Faith Evans was performed on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]]'s ''Celebration of Gospel '07''. A special edition of ''Grateful'' only available through [[Wal-Mart]] includes two bonus tracks "I Wish" and Brent Jones' "Midnite" featuring Coko on lead vocals. Coko was reported to have joined an all-black touring cast performing the critically acclaimed play ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'', along with [[Sherri Shepherd]], [[Star Jones]], [[Vanessa L. Williams]], and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurweb.com/story/eur39840.cfm |title=Star Jones, Sherri Shepherd in 'Monologues': New black version of 'Vagina Monologues' to begin tour next month. |date=2008-01-09 |publisher=EURweb |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112115943/http://www.eurweb.com/story/eur39840.cfm |archive-date=2008-01-12 }}</ref> In June 2008, Coko performed in Japan for the Billboard Live Tour. She sang some of her solo hits "Sunshine", "Clap Your Hands", and the SWV song "[[Right Here/Human Nature]]".

As promised, the show has documented the trust issues the groupmates have with one another from their acrimonious split and their attempt to rebuild their friendships and their brand. It also showcased their professional endeavors and struggles, including touring and recording a comeback album, trying to get out of a record contract and disputes with their road manager, Cory Taylor. Subplots included Coko's reluctance to record secular music after her foray into gospel, Taj's health issues and Lelee's tumultuous relationship with her daughter.
