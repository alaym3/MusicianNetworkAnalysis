== Name ==
Latinen thought of the band's long name when it was still his solo project. He wanted a name that sounded "elaborate and artistic" but admits that if he would have known that the project would form into a full band he would have chosen something easier to remember.<ref name="wordpress1">Diatribe Inc.

Keith explains the name:

{{quote|As for the meaning behind the name, I've had a lifetime of bands not working out, and so I chose a name to reflect my frustration.  I tend to hide lyrics and names behind a lot of dense symbolism, so here's the general break-down of the name. "Empire! Empire!" is that one evasive dream that you want so badly, and you will always chase it, but it never seems quite in reach.  The "(I Was a Lonely Estate)" portion was where I felt I was incomplete and insignificant.  It's hard to get off the ground if you can't find reliable people to share your dream. The exclamation points mark how important the dream is, and the parenthesis signify that I feel like I am unimportant and unnoticed.<ref name="wordpress1"/>}}
