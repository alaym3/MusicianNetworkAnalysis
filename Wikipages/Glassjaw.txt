'''Glassjaw''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Hempstead, New York]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/music/Glassjaw|title=Glassjaw music, videos, stats, and photos {{!}} Last.fm|website=Last.fm|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}</ref> The band is fronted by vocalist [[Daryl Palumbo]] and guitarist [[Justin Beck]], and was a major part of the Long Island music scene in the early 2000s. The band has been influential in the progression of the [[underground music]] scene in the eastern United States and United Kingdom and on the [[post-hardcore]] genre, and are known for their intense live shows.<ref name="thegrixer.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.thegrixer.com/Glassjaw.html |title=Glassjaw |publisher=Thegrixer.com |access-date=2010-08-01}}</ref> and frequent line-up changes.<ref name="thegrixer.com"/><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070202020135/http://www.danceinmyblood.com/2007/01/31/glassjaw-in-kerrang-february-07/]</ref>

==Biography==
=== Early years (1993–1998) ===
The band formed in the summer of 1993 after Palumbo and Beck met each other at camp. Of the band name, Beck has said: "We had a list of names, and we were just like, let's pick one of these band names which ones the coolest. At the time there were a bunch of bands coming out with two names in one like that, like mouthpiece, curbjaw, stuff like that. We were going down the list, and the first name that I liked was Swiftkick. I'm all like, that's a sick name. But for some reason Glassjaw stuck. There's really no reason behind it; it just sounded cool."<ref name="redstarmag.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.redstarmag.com/forum2/content.php?article.5 |title=Redstar Magazine: Article / Glassjaw |publisher=Redstarmag.com |access-date=2010-08-01}}</ref> The band played their first show in 1994 in Oceanside, New York. In the early days, Beck and Weinstock were also playing with [[Jewish]] [[straight edge]] [[metalcore]] band, [[Sons of Abraham (band)|Sons of Abraham]]. Sons of Abraham constitute an important influence on Glassjaw, songs such as "Hurting and Shoving (She Should Have Let Me Sleep)" by Glassjaw drawing particularly on earlier Sons of Abraham releases. Palumbo was in his own straight-edge band called XbustedX. The group's line-up changed constantly in their early years while they played in the local [[New York hardcore]] scene. Beck's primary instrument throughout this time was drums, but switched to bass guitar when Ariel Telford left the band in 1998, and then switched to lead guitar when Kris Baldwin left and Manuel Carrero joined the band in 1999. From 1994 to 1999 the band did several demo recordings of some songs that would eventually appear on their official releases, as well as several other compositions that would not see official release. The band recorded the five-song ''[[Kiss Kiss Bang Bang EP|Kiss Kiss Bang Bang]]'' [[extended play|EP]] in 1997. The record was released independently on the label 2 Cents a Pop, and saw a re-release in 2001 without label affiliation.  The line-up on this record was Daryl Palumbo, Justin Beck, Todd Weinstock, Kris Baldwin and Ariel Telford. "Star Above My Bed", from the EP, is still in the band's set lists to this day. A significant recording came in 1999 working with [[Don Fury]] ([[Quicksand (band)|Quicksand]], [[Snapcase]], [[Orange 9mm]], [[The Hearing Aides]]), showcasing songs that appeared on their debut LP ''[[Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence]]''.

===''Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence'' (1999–2000)===
{{Main|Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Silence}}

In 1999, the band entered the studio at Indigo Ranch in Malibu, California, with producer [[Ross Robinson]] ([[At the Drive-In]], [[Korn]], [[Limp Bizkit]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], among others) to record their first full-length album titled ''[[Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence]]'', which saw release in 2000 through [[Roadrunner Records]]. On being signed, guitarist Justin Beck said: "Ross showed up at a practice, we start a song; 5-4-3-2-1. Ross stands up, waving his hands and he's like, 'It's over, it's done. I want to do this, you've got a deal!'<ref name="thegauntlet.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.thegauntlet.com/bio/171/Glassjaw.html |title=Glassjaw |publisher=The Gauntlet |access-date=2010-08-01}}</ref> The line-up on this record was Palumbo, Beck, Todd Weinstock, Manuel Carrero & Sammy Siegler (who left the band prior to the subsequent tour). Robinson has said of it: "Our goal at the time of that record was to destroy Adidas rock",<ref name="loudside.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.loudside.com/music/artists/Glassjaw |title=Music - Artists - Glassjaw |publisher=Loudside.com |access-date=2010-08-01}}</ref> a self-deprecating reference to the Adidas-sponsored bands (Korn, Limp Bizkit) Robinson had produced and championed as part of the nu-metal movement.<ref name="2-4-7-music.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.2-4-7-music.com/newsitems/july02/glassjaw.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020811180558/http://www.2-4-7-music.com/newsitems/july02/glassjaw.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=2002-08-11 |title=Glassjaw Interviews ~ Crud Magazine ~ Ozzfest 2002 Castle Donnington, England |publisher=2-4-7-music.com |access-date=2010-08-01 }}</ref> The music was aggressive and unrelenting, but also included spacious songs like "When One Eight Becomes Two Zeros", "Her Middle Name is Boom", "Piano" and the epic "Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence", the latter of which deals with Palumbo's problems with [[Crohn's disease]].<ref name="thegauntlet.com"/> The music, accompanied with Palumbo's lyrics—which were often bitter and resentful towards particular characters he was discussing—and his singing style in itself—powerful and aggressive guttural screaming along with a melodic touch—created a unique dynamic. Although ''Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence'' is often cited as a milestone post-hardcore album, it saw little push from Roadrunner, causing the band to become disillusioned with the label. Matters were somewhat worsened when Palumbo started to have bouts with his Crohn's disease on tour, as his aggressive performance style sometimes triggers a relapse, which has the potential to be fatal. It is alleged that Roadrunner would not allow Palumbo to leave the tour to rest.

[[Larry Gorman]] of [[Orange 9mm]] officially took over drumming duties part-way through touring, which saw dates with [[Deftones]] and a six-week European tour with [[Soulfly]].<ref name="mtv.com">{{cite web|author=Joe D'Angelo |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1435435/20001227/glassjaw.jhtml |title=Glassjaw Preparing To Punch Out Next Album - News Story &#124; Music, Celebrity, Artist News &#124; MTV News |publisher=Mtv.com |date=2000-12-27 |access-date=2010-08-01}}</ref> The line-up continued to rotate following the conclusion of the tour when Manuel Carrero was kicked out by Roadrunner for being the only member to have date conflicts with touring.

The album was pressed onto vinyl in 2009, limited to 10,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=9241929&st=glassjaw&lp=2&type=product&cp=1&id=1954756 |title=Everything You Ever Wanted to Know...

===''Worship and Tribute'' (2001–2003)===
{{Main|Worship and Tribute}}
In 2001, the band entered the studio in secret with Ross Robinson and began recording their follow-up album ''[[Worship and Tribute]]'', which would see release the following year. The album was engineered and mixed by [[Mike Fraser (record producer)|Mike Fraser]]. They left Roadrunner, finding them problematic, and shopped the album to other labels and ended up signing a deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]]. The line-up on this record was Palumbo, Beck (who also provided bass duties), Weinstock, and [[Shannon Larkin]] of [[Amen (American band)|Amen]] and later [[Godsmack]], who provided drumming duties due to recording time constraints, as he had worked well with producer Ross Robinson in the past, although Larry Gorman was composing parts and officially the drummer of the band. Ross Robinson does not use a 'click track' (automated metronome) when recording drummers, as he believes "it takes away from the true essence of the music". This album showcased a more melodic and mature Glassjaw, as they started to further incorporate [[jazz]] and [[Ambient music|ambient]] influences, particularly in tracks like "Ape Dos Mil", "Must've Run All Day", "The Gillette Cavalcade of Sports", and "Convectuoso" (which did not appear on the official release due to a publishing dispute with Roadrunner). Palumbo said of it: "It's a mélange of influences, a collage is what this band is all about. This record pays tribute to everything from [[Bad Brains]] to [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] to [[The Cure]] to [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]] and so much more."<ref name="loudside.com"/> Lyrically, the more confrontational elements heard on 'Everything...' were reined in, with Palumbo taking a more cerebral approach.

Dave Allen joined the group as bassist following the recording of the album. The band then toured extensively throughout 2002–2003, playing all over the world, including festival tours such as [[Warped Tour]], [[Ozzfest]] and [[Snocore]]. In October 2002, dates in Germany and the UK were cancelled when Palumbo was hospitalized in Paris after suffering a relapse of the Crohn's; he underwent intestinal surgery.<ref>{{cite web |last=Adams |first=Sean |url=http://drownedinsound.com/news/5001 |title=Glassjaw: Nooo!

===Hiatus and rebirth (2004–2008)===
The band took a hiatus in 2004, while Palumbo was composing and performing with his new group [[Head Automatica]]—which included drummer Larry Gorman—and Beck worked on his band merchandise business. In late 2004, Todd Weinstock, Dave Allen, and Larry Gorman were all fired from the band, fueling rumors that they had split up.<ref name="drownedinsound.com">{{cite web |url=http://drownedinsound.com/news/10873 |title=LastJAw - US hardcore heroes end it? / Music News // Drowned In Sound |publisher=Drownedinsound.com |date=2004-12-14 |access-date=2010-08-01 |archive-date=2011-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227090808/http://drownedinsound.com/news/10873 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Indeed, the band's website displayed "RIP GlassJAw" in the header for a time, though this may have been in jest.<ref name="drownedinsound.com"/> The band denied that they were splitting up and cited Palumbo's ongoing problems with [[Crohn's disease]] as one of the reasons for the hiatus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=11110 |title=Glassjaw Stay Together, Currently On Break - in Metal News |publisher=Metal Underground.com |access-date=2010-08-01}}</ref>

After a two-year hiatus, the band played three shows in 2005; two at [[The Downtown]] in [[Farmingdale, New York]], with proceeds going to charity, and a spot on [[The Used]]'s tour at the ''Hammerstein Ballroom''. They were initially meant to be main tour support for The Used, but Palumbo had further problems with his Crohn's (Head Automatica also cancelled all their US shows).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=14922 |title=H2O To Fill Void Left By Glassjaw On The Used Tour - in Metal News |publisher=Metal Underground.com |access-date=2010-08-01}}</ref> Manuel Carrero, who had been playing with a band named The Jiant, replaced Allen as bassist after nearly five years away from the group. Durijah Lang, who was also a former band member from their early years, replaced Larry Gorman behind the kit. The band did not fill its vacant guitarist role and continued as a four-piece.

In October 2005 the band released a [[B-side]] [[Extended play|EP]] of songs not used on ''[[Worship and Tribute]]'', titled ''[[El Mark]]''. Their official website became active once again in November 2006. The band would go on to tour in December of that year as support for [[Deftones]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/glassjaw%20comeback_1017819 |title=Glassjaw - Glassjaw Comeback - Contactmusic News |publisher=Contactmusic.com |access-date=2010-08-01}}</ref> and a few headlining shows of their own (dubbed the ''Fucking Tour 2006''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danceinmyblood.com/2006/12/16/glassjaw-fort-worth-tx-12-16-2006/ |title=» Glassjaw Fort Worth, TX (12-16-2006) - Dance in my Blood |date=2006-12-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105205149/http://www.danceinmyblood.com/2006/12/16/glassjaw-fort-worth-tx-12-16-2006/ |access-date=2020-03-11|archive-date=2007-01-05 }}</ref>).

Glassjaw's official site homepage showed "7.7.7." in large bold text, referring to a one-off show at the [[Carling Academy Brixton]] in England. It was then announced on fan site Glassjaw.net that they would be playing a warm up show at the Camden Barfly on 6.7.7. These shows were the first in the UK for four years. At the end of 2007, Glassjaw, for the first time, headlined in southern California in various venues such as the Avalon in Hollywood, the [[House of Blues]] in San Diego, and the Glasshouse in Pomona.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shabooty.com/2007/10/24/daryl_palumbo_cc.php |title=Shabooty Interview Series: Daryl Palumbo of Head Automatica & GlassJAw |publisher=Shabooty.com |date=2007-10-24 |access-date=2010-08-01}}</ref> This was dubbed the "100% Maybe" tour, a joke referring to the uncertain nature of their tours due to frequent cancellations. The band was one of the headlining acts of 2007's [[Saints & Sinners Festival]] at the [[Asbury Park Convention Hall]] in [[Asbury Park]], [[New Jersey]], along with [[Against Me!]].

In 2008, Glassjaw returned to the UK, playing at the two-day festival [[Give It A Name]] in Sheffield on May 10, and in London on May 11. They also did shows in [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]], and [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]].

===''Our Color Green'' and ''Coloring Book'' (2008–2014)===
Glassjaw's next release was highly anticipated, not only due to their last full-length release dating back to 2002, but also the delay and lack of information regarding its status and/or release. In an interview with Palumbo in the July 2006 issue of [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|''AP magazine'']], he stated that the band were in the process of writing and recording new material for the next album, which they hoped to release in 2007. Palumbo hinted that there could be a unifying concept behind the album.
In November 2007, in the first Glassjaw interview in years, Beck revealed they had written "about eleven good songs -- seven [that] I love, and four to six half-baked ideas we need to finish".<ref name="thegrixer.com"/> In an interview with ''[[Kerrang!]]'', Palumbo stated that the new album should be released by "The end of this year or early 2009...I hope." Details emerged from ''The Grixer'' in May 2008 that the album was "awaiting vocals" and "should be wrapped up and completed in the coming months".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danceinmyblood.com/2008/05/06/the-grixer-gj-album-completed-soon/ |title=» The Grixer: GJ Album Completed Soon. - Dance in my Blood |date=2008-07-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724223743/http://www.danceinmyblood.com/2008/05/06/the-grixer-gj-album-completed-soon/ |access-date=2020-03-11|archive-date=2008-07-24 }}</ref> In a May 2008 interview with ''Verse One'' magazine, Beck said: "Right now I’d just be happy to finish up this record.

The album was not produced by Ross Robinson, as with previous releases; instead Beck co-produced the album with his friend [[Jonathan Florencio]]. Florencio also engineered the album.<ref name="thegrixer.com"/><ref name="verseonemagazine.com"/><ref name="forum.glassjaw.net"/> By June 2008, drums, bass, and guitar parts of thirteen songs had been tracked,<ref name="forum.glassjaw.net"/> however vocal tracking was incomplete, with some vocals having been recorded for "You Think You're (John Fucking Lennon)", "Jesus Glue", the reworked "Star Above My Bed" (based on the [[Kiss Kiss Bang Bang]] and not Don Fury version), and "Natural Born Farmer,"<ref name="alterthepress.com">{{cite web|last=Ableson |first=Jon |url=http://www.alterthepress.com/2008/10/exclusive-justin-beck-off-record.html |title=Exclusive: Justin Beck - Off The Record |publisher=Alter The Press! |date=2007-10-01 |access-date=2010-08-01}}</ref> all of which had been played live and which were expected to be included on the album;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.kerrang.com/2008/05/glassjaw_give_it_a_name_110520.html |title=Kerrang!

In the fall of 2009, Glassjaw supported Brand New on their headline tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/brandnew |title=Brand New op MySpace Music – Gratis gestreamde MP3's, foto's en Videoclips |publisher=Myspace.com |access-date=2010-08-01}}</ref> Not long after, Palumbo, Beck and Manny conducted an exclusive video interview for Glassjaw.net on [[Ryan's Rock Show]], where the band stated that the long absence of released material was due to "decisions we made when we were 21 years old," alluding to a possible legal/contractual dispute with either Roadrunner or most likely with their second major label, Warner Bros.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ryansrockshow.com/php2/interviews/1055-glassjaw-interview-on-ryans-rock-show.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 9, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204001417/http://www.ryansrockshow.com/php2/interviews/1055-glassjaw-interview-on-ryans-rock-show.html |archive-date=December 4, 2009 }}</ref>

In December 2009, it was announced that Manuel Carrero and Durijah Lang left Saves the Day in order to focus entirely on Glassjaw.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=13782 |title=Saves The Day members leave band for Glassjaw // News // Lambgoat |publisher=Lambgoat.com |date=2009-12-21 |access-date=2010-08-01}}</ref> This made it clear that both Carrero and Lang are not just hired touring musicians and are full-time members.

In January 2010, Glassjaw debuted a new song, entitled "All Good Junkies Go To Heaven" live on their UK tour.  The song's title was announced by Daryl Palumbo via Twitter some months before.  It was the first new song that Glassjaw has played in nearly four years ("Lennon" and "Jesus Glue" were debuted late 2006). In addition, the band also added "El Mark" and "Convectuoso" to their setlists, two fan-favorite B-sides that had been sparingly played live. On the last show of their 2010 tour at Emo's in Austin, TX, the band premiered a new song with the tentative title "Wolfegg".

In August 2010, Glassjaw returned to the UK to headline the [[Hevy Music Festival]] held at the [[Port Lympne Wild Animal Park]] near [[Folkestone]]. Temporary session bassist Sarosh Brohi stepped in for the tour.

To promote an EP consisting of 5 new songs, Glassjaw presented a unique marketing program where fans were offered a free digital release in conjunction with a special limited product or event. Any time a fan bought an item off their online store, included but not mentioned in the package, the fan would get a 2" die-cut plastic logo for free. Other fans received a random postcard in the mail. The postcard had no return label, no explanation and consisted of a perforated logo. On August 8, 2010 (8/8) the band released a 7" vinyl single for "All Good Junkies Go to Heaven" spray-painted green and pink on either side of the vinyl at the UK's Hevy Fest.  This is the first official Glassjaw release since 2005's El Mark EP.  On August 8, 2010 via MerchDirect, "All Good Junkies Go To Heaven" became available for purchase. Within hours of availability, the vinyl had sold out. Fans soon realized that in order to play the vinyl, they needed the die-cut logo. Shortly thereafter, in addition to the launch of the single, a "one-take" live video of their 2008 song "You Think You're John Fucking Lennon" was posted on the official Glassjaw website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glassjaw.com|title=Glassjaw|website=Glassjaw|access-date=9 November 2017}}</ref> 
Glassjaw then announced the release of another vinyl single for release on September 9, 2010 (9/9) for the song "Jesus Glue," as well as a digital download for "All Good Junkies Go To Heaven" in various formats.

On September 23, the band posted a video for the song, "Stars," a reworked version of "Star Above my Bed," a fan favorite.<ref>{{cite web|last=Modern |first=Sons |url=http://vimeo.com/15220435 |title=Glassjaw - Stars (DOGMA) on Vimeo |publisher=Vimeo.com |access-date=2010-12-20}}</ref> As they did with "Junkies" and "Jesus Glue," continuing the date patterns of 8/8, 9/9, on October 10, 2010 (10/10) the band released another vinyl, containing the track "Natural Born Farmer" and the digital release of "Jesus Glue."

On December 12, 2010 (12/12), Glassjaw released "You Think You're (John Fucking Lennon)" on vinyl which instantly sold out. On December 19, an Amazon.com page listing was opened for a Glassjaw EP titled, ''[[Our Color Green (The Singles)]]'' (an allusion to the band's first release) with a 1/1/11 release date,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004GDV36M/ref=sr_1_album_7_rd?ie=UTF8&child=B004GDZ6QA&qid=1 |title=Our Color Green (The Singles) [Explicit&#93;: Glassjaw: MP3 Downloads |website=Amazon |access-date=2010-12-20}}</ref> all but confirming the rumors of the vinyl tracks being on the aforementioned EP.

Glassjaw were also added to the [[Sonisphere]] festival line-up around this time were to perform Worship & Tribute in its entirety during their set. However, it was announced on March 29, 2012 via Sonisphere's website that the festival was canceled due to issues in setting up the festival. As a result, the band scheduled a date at New York's Irving Plaza to play the album in its entirety.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sonisphere.co.uk/news/sonisphere-knebworth-is-cancelled/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-04-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331010710/http://sonisphere.co.uk/news/sonisphere-knebworth-is-cancelled/ |archive-date=2012-03-31 }}</ref> The band also played [[Hevy Festival|Hevy Fest]] in 2012, alongside acts such as [[Converge (band)|Converge]], [[Rolo Tomassi]] and [[Will Haven]]. It marked Glassjaw's second time playing at the festival, and the first since headlining it in 2010. On December 1, 2012 the band played the Unsilent Night Festival in Texas, where they performed a cover of the [[108 (band)|108]] song "Woman".

In 2013, the band embarked on a summer headlining tour in the United States. In the fall, the band played [[Riot Fest]] in Chicago, as well as an opening for [[Deftones]] at a Los Angeles show at the Greek Theater, and also played a headlining show in Santa Ana, California.

At the beginning of 2014, the band participated in the [[Soundwave (Australian music festival)|Soundwave Festival]] in Australia, as well as playing a few Australian club shows with [[The Dillinger Escape Plan]]. In the summer of 2014, Glassjaw once again briefly returned to performing, playing a brief set at the Amnesia Rockfest (in Montebello, QC). Later in the fall, the band played [[Riot Fest]] in both Denver and Toronto, [[Made In America Festival]] in Philadelphia, and [[Fun Fun Fun Fest]] in Austin, Texas, which would be the band's last performance with Carrero on bass and Lang on drums.

On the weekend of November 28, 2014, the band's merchandise website had a Black Friday sale where fans would get 19.93% off their order if they applied the promo code "weactuallyjuststartedwriting", hinting that a new album was in the works.

===Line-up change and ''Material Control'' (2015–present)===
In July 2015 it was confirmed by drummer Durijah Lang that he and bass player Manuel Carrero quit the band in January. When asked for an explanation, Lang reportedly said, "I just felt like I needed to. No axe to grind with those guys. I just ran out of good reasons not to call it a day." The two went on to join [[Burn (band)|Burn]].

Both Lang and Carrero were replaced by two former [[Glass Cloud]] members in bassist Travis Sykes and drummer Chad Hasty.

Glassjaw's first performance with the newly installed rhythm section was a surprise performance at Amityville Music Hall in Amityville, NY on August 7, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iguZHG6Gw0|title=Glassjaw - You think you're (John fucking Lennon ) / Tip your bartender Secret show 8/7/15|date=7 August 2015|website=Youtube.com|access-date=9 November 2017}}</ref> Along with that performance, the band played a handful of performances including Wrecking Ball Festival, Heavy Montreal, Taste Of Chaos Festival, and Aftershock Festival, as well as a show opening for [[Coheed And Cambria]] in Asbury Park, New Jersey, and a headling show in San Francisco with [[Dance Gavin Dance]].

On December 1, 2015, Glassjaw released a new song titled "New White Extremity" on the band's SoundCloud account. Music news website Pitchfork stated that the band would be releasing a new album, but did not give detail on when the album would be released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/62333-glassjaw-return-with-new-white-extremity/|title=Glassjaw Return With "New White Extremity"|website=Pitchfork.com|date=December 2015|access-date=9 November 2017}}</ref> 
On January 31, 2016 Glassjaw [http://diymag.com/2016/01/31/glassjaw-the-old-blue-last-london-new-album debuted new material at The Old Blue Last in London]. At this warm up show, they performed "New White Extremity" as well as six other new songs, which they did not name at the time. The following night, February 1, 2016 Glassjaw played at the O2 Ritz in Manchester Theater, again playing more new material including another song called "Shira".

In February and March 2016, Glassjaw opened for [[Coheed and Cambria]] on their ''[[The Color Before the Sun]]'' tour in the United Kingdom and in the United States. During this tour, the band played "New White Extremity" and "Shira". Also during this tour, they played 7 small headlining shows in nearby cities. At these headlining shows, the band's setlist contained mostly new songs that have yet to be released. Some of these news songs are speculated to be titled "Neo", "Metal", "Post Apocalyptic", and "Abigados".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/glassjaw/2016/south-side-ballroom-dallas-tx-2bf01482.html|title=Glassjaw Setlist at South Side Ballroom, Dallas|website=setlist.fm|access-date=9 November 2017}}</ref> The band did not make any other announcements about their oft-rumored third album for nearly two years. However, on May 18, 2016 it was announced that the band would be playing both Denver and Chicago dates of Riot Fest.

In December 2016, [[The Dillinger Escape Plan]] drummer [[Billy Rymer]] confirmed that he'd tracked drums for "a whole album's worth of material" towards the band's third album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadpress.co.uk/66800/news-glassjaws-third-album-to-feature-drums-from-billy-rymer-the-dillinger-escape-plan|title=NEWS: Glassjaw's third album to feature drums from Billy Rymer (The Dillinger Escape Plan)!|website=Deadpress.co.uk|date=6 December 2016|access-date=9 November 2017}}</ref>

==Musical style==

Apart from this, Palumbo's lyrics are known to frequently quote other artists as a tribute, quoting acts such as [[Frank Zappa]], [[Tori Amos]], [[Gravediggaz]], among others.

RockSound named the band "The Biggest DIY Band In The World" because of the band's independence from major labels, insistence on maintaining creative control of both their sound and presentation and grass roots approach to distributing their music despite several hiatuses. On why the band still exists, Palumbo stated, "Glassjaw provides a real outlet for all our creativity. And allows us to sit around making dick and fart jokes all day." Beck stated, "Glassjaw would suck if this was how we paid our rent because then you'd make stupid decisions in order to pay the bills. Once money and popularity have a bearing on your art then it's gone, diluted. You lose it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocksound.tv/features/read/glassjaw-speak-on-inspiration-rumours-and-the-future|title=Glassjaw Speak: On Inspiration, Rumours And The Future - Features - Rock Sound Magazine|website=Rock Sound Magazine|access-date=9 November 2017}}</ref>

In a nod to how the band shuns the music industry standard of putting out an album, when asked why the long wait for new music, Palumbo stated "...we write a lot. When the band is at the forefront, that’s when the spark really seems to happen. If it was up to me and him, we’d get together every weekend and make an album almost every few months. But I think the most poignant and potent Glassjaw &#91;comes from&#93; us stockpiling the goodness until it’s time to do it. And when it’s time to do it, the universe very much lets us know.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theprp.com/2016/02/15/news/glassjaw-talk-heavy-and-groovy-new-album-reveal-guest-appearance/|title=Glassjaw Talk About Their Upcoming New Album, Reveal Guest Appearance|date=15 February 2016|website=Theprp.com|access-date=9 November 2017}}</ref>

==Problems with Roadrunner Records==
Both Palumbo and Beck continue to speak unfavourably of Roadrunner, years after the problems the band experienced with them. They openly advise people not to buy their first full-length so as not to give the label money, and have repeatedly told fans at shows to illegally download the record.<ref name="forum.glassjaw.net"/> Palumbo has said of them: "Roadrunner is a joke. Roadrunner’s not even a real label. It has the power to be one of the superpowers in the heavy music industry. While labels like [[Victory Records]], which is such a small hardcore label, is totally surpassing Roadrunner. Roadrunner is a joke. It's like the scourge of the music industry."<ref name="showandtellonline.com"/> Beck has said: "Seriously, don't ever support anything from Roadrunner -- they suck!"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2088288640270252305 |title=Glassjaw - Interview with The Suicide Girls |access-date=2010-08-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519194615/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2088288640270252305 |archive-date=2011-05-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Palumbo has said that Roadrunner didn't put the band on enough tours: "We never toured half as much as we wanted to, I just wish we got to tour more in support of [''Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence'']"; and "We were on Roadrunner for a couple of years and Roadrunner was a joke, a fuckin' joke of a label. They are a miserable fuckin' corporation that does not bend for their bands, does not give their bands anything and they're just terrible businessmen. They are a giant joke of a label. They had 2 cash cows, Slipknot and Nickelback, and every other project they had rode backseat to those bands, and then the second that the new Slipknot record came out and didn't go quadruple Platinum in the first few hours it was released they fuckin' turned their backs on Slipknot. That label just wants instant gratification where it sells its units and that's a joke. You can't run a major corporation with that as your business strategy".<ref name="2-4-7-music.com"/>

Regarding the re-release of the remastered version of ''Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence'' in March 2009 by Roadrunner, Beck was quoted by Alter The Press! in saying "It's complete shit!  We had nothing to do with it.  DO NOT BUY IT!  It's embarrassing."<ref>{{cite web|last=Ableson |first=Jon |url=http://www.alterthepress.com/2009/03/atp-exclusive-glassjaw-comment-on.html |title=ATP Exclusive: Glassjaw Comment On Recent Re-Release |publisher=Alter The Press! |access-date=2010-08-01}}</ref>

== Musical influence and legacy ==
Glassjaw have been regarded as one of the most influential bands of the [[post-hardcore]] genre. Born of the Long Island hardcore scene, producer [[Ross Robinson]] declared in 2000 that Glassjaw "was on a mission to destroy the ‘Adidas Rock’ of nu-metal bands like Limp Bizkit."<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/08/worship-and-tribute-difficult-world-of-glassjaw-fandom|title=Worship and Tribute: the difficult world of Glassjaw fandom|last=Kowalczyk|first=Pete|date=2016-02-08|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-02|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Their usage of dissonant melodies through their two guitarists, Justin Beck and Todd Weinstock, created a jazz-like sound that was unique and original for the genre.<ref name=":0" /> Nick Greer of [[Sputnikmusic]] stated that "part of what makes Glassjaw such a stand out band is a combination of structured genre blending and blissfully naive experimentation."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/blog/2010/06/10/top-100-albums-of-the-decade-30-11/|title=Sputnikmusic - Top 100 Albums of the Decade (30 – 11) « Staff Blog|website=Sputnikmusic.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-02}}</ref> Michael Ventimiglia of the [[Long Island Press]] said that their ''Worship and Tribute'' album "helped shape and define music for a new generation."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.longislandpress.com/2012/07/05/retro-review-glassjaws-worship-and-tribute/|title=Retro-Review: Glassjaw's Worship and Tribute {{!}} Long Island Press|website=Archive.longislandpress.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-02}}</ref>

They always taught me to go against the grain, pay more attention to dynamics and think outside of the box when writing songs. I like to think that our new material is heavily GlassJaw-influenced."<ref name=":1" /> Mike Cunniff of Boston Manor said that "they definitely have a strong cult following not dissimilar to [[Brand New (band)|Brand New]]. Their music has stood the test of time because they have always been so fresh and original.”<ref name=":1" />
