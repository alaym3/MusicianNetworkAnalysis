Winners in WMA's major award categories were allowed to choose beneficiaries of financial assistance worth Php 100,000. Morissette's choice was Home for the Angels in [[Santa Ana, Manila]], a crisis center for abandoned infants. She commended this unique aspect of the event and shared "I feel blessed because last year I've won awards but they recognized me as a new artist. This one is different because I'm giving away to a beneficiary ... not just winning for myself".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wish1075.com/wishawards/?p=3507|title=1st Wish 107.5 Music Awards Grants Over Php 1M to Winners' Beneficiaries|work=Wish Awards|access-date=March 12, 2017}}</ref>

For the second time, she performed in the 2016 ''[[Himig Handog]] P-Pop Love Songs'' competition. She interpreted "Diamante", composed by Jungee Marcelo.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.gigsmanila.com/news/song-feature-diamante-morrissette-himig-handog-p-pop-love-songs-2016/|title=Song Feature: Diamante – Morissette (Himig Handog P-Pop Love Songs 2016)|work=GigsManila|access-date=March 12, 2017}}</ref>

Morissette is a regular on ABS-CBN's Sunday afternoon show ''ASAP'', as one of the Birit Queens. Other members of this group include Angeline Quinto, Klarisse de Guzman, and [[Jona Viray|Jonalyn Viray]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.onemusic.ph/news/prepare-night-biritan-2488|title=ASAP Birit Queens to hold a major concert|website=One Music PH|access-date=March 12, 2017}}</ref> There were speculations that the individual members of the group tried to outshine each other. Morissette stated in an interview that ''ASAP'' assigned them songs to sing and that the group worked together for the various song numbers. She further clarified that when it was her turn she would give her all, but during the time the group merged voices they should blend together.<ref name=":3" /> On January 22, 2017, it was announced the group would stage their first concert, which was held on March 31, 2017, at the SM [[Mall of Asia Arena]]. The group disbanded in late 2017, but had a reunion on June 2, 2019, as part of her birthday production number.

She was awarded as the Female Artist of the Year by ABS-CBN's M.O.R. Pinoy Music Awards in 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/08/08/16/who-won-at-this-years-mor-pinoy-music-awards|title=Who won at this year's MOR Pinoy Music Awards|work=ABS-CBN News|access-date=March 12, 2017}}</ref>

Morissette held her first major concert at the Music Museum on the August 13, 2016. During this sold-out show, she sang a combination of old and new songs, including Beyoncé's "Love On Top", the ditty she did during her blind audition for ''The Voice'', [[Barbra Streisand]]'s "[[Papa, Can You Hear Me?]]" from the movie ''[[Yentl (film)|Yentl]]'', as well as [[Basil Valdez]]'s "Iduyan Mo", and her singles, "'Di Mapaliwanag" and "Throwback".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://billboard.ph/morissette-wows-jam-packed-audience-at-the-music-museum/|title=Rising Pop Star Morissette Wows Soldout Audience in Her First Major Concert|last=Yumul|first=Tricco|date=August 18, 2016|work=Billboard Philippines|access-date=March 17, 2017}}</ref> Her performance of "I'm Here" from the musical [[The Color Purple (musical)|''The Color Purple'']] garnered praise from international Broadway star and ''The Voice Philippines'' coach [[Lea Salonga]], who noted how she sang the song with authority.<ref>{{Cite news|work=Philippine Entertainment Portal|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/media/14869/watch-the-morissette-amon-performance-that-made-lea-salonga-rave|title=Morissette Amon performance that made Lea Salonga rave|last=Llanes|first=Rommel|access-date=March 17, 2017}}</ref> Prior to the concert Morissette revealed that she envisioned it to be a means where she could showcase her versatility as an artist. Specifically, she wanted to break free from her stereotype as a belter, and show her skill in dancing as well as demonstrating her softer side, which she did not get to show often.<ref name=":13">{{Cite news|url=http://www.balitangamerica.tv/morissette-amon-on-going-beyond-birit-i-want-to-showcase-my-versatility/|title=Morissette Amon on going beyond birit: 'I want to showcase my versatility'|work=Balitang America|access-date=March 19, 2017}}</ref>

She topped the 2017 2nd Wish 107.5 Music Awards with a total of eight awards, far more than any artist nominated. Morissette won all the six categories she was nominated in, and joined the Wishclusive Elite Circle with two Bronze Awards for her version of [[Mariah Carey]]'s "[[Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)#Mariah Carey version|Against All Odds]]" and [[Little Mix]]'s "[[Secret Love Song]]".<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/01/17/17/emotional-morissette-tops-wish-awards|title=Emotional Morissette tops Wish awards|last=Rivera|first=Yarden|work=ABS-CBN News|access-date=March 12, 2017}}</ref> It is awarded to any [[DWNU|Wish]] artist garnering at least 10 million YouTube views.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wish1075.com/2nd-wish-107-5-music-awards-the-birth-of-the-wishclusive-elite-circle/|title=2nd Wish 107.5 Music Awards: The birth of the WISHclusive Elite Circle|website=wish1075.com|access-date=March 12, 2017}}</ref> Four of her awards were for her cover of "Secret Love Song", which became popular and reached 1 million YouTube views only a week after it premiered.<ref name=":1" /> As of February 2017 this performance was the first to hit 25&nbsp;million views in Wish 107.5's YouTube channel, and has guaranteed Morissette at least a Silver WISHclusive Elite Circle award for the next WMA.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wish1075.com/wishawards/?p=4527|title=Morissette's 'Secret Love Song' first to reach 25M hits on Wish 107.5 YT Channel|work=Wish Awards|access-date=March 12, 2017}}</ref>

Morissette has often been referred to as "Asia's Phoenix" since her performance at the 14th [[Asia Song Festival]] in [[Busan, South Korea]] on September 24, 2017, where she represented the [[Philippines]].<ref name="Inquirer.Net"/><ref name="ABS-CBN News"/> She returned to the same festival to represent the Philippines in the succeeding 15th Asia Song Festival in Busan on October 3, 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://entertainment.inquirer.net/296863/morissette-amon-represents-ph-asia-song-festival-2018|title=Morissette Amon represents PH in Asia Song Festival 2018|work=Inquirer|date=October 3, 2018|access-date=October 3, 2018}}</ref>

In February 2018, Morissette had her biggest concert to date which was called "Made". The highlight of the concert was the introduction of her idol, Regine Velasquez, who joined her for the [[duet]] of Morissette hit "Akin Ka Na Lang" and Morissette couldn't hold her tears back.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/02/21/18/watch-morissette-weeps-at-concert-as-regine-joins-her-for-duet|title=Watch: Morissette weeps at concert as Regine joins her for duet|work=ABS-CBN News|access-date=March 14, 2018}}</ref>

And within four weeks of its release, "Love You Still" charted in 12 countries including the U.S. and U.K.<ref>{{cite tweet|number=1337297622374129665|user=ChartMorissette|title=LOOK: Morissette's "Love You Still" has charted in 12 countries via iTunes since its release.

In May 2021, Morissette released her official recording of "Shine" in celebration of the song's silver anniversary.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR-a6r2ZfoU</ref> The timely release was a re-introduction of "Shine's" original lyrics composed by multi-awarded songwriter [[Trina Belamide]] who joined forces with [[Star Music]] to reproduce the well-loved composition originally sung by Ima Castro and later rendered by [[Regine Velasquez]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.abs-cbn.com/newsroom/news-releases/2021/5/20/morissette-reimagines-shine-to-celebrate-the-son?lang=en|title=Morissette reimagines "Shine" to celebrate the song's 25th year|work=ABS-CBN|date=May 21, 2021|access-date=May 20, 2021}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Morissette writes on Instagram. Singers Morissette Amon and Dave Lamar are engaged. The two shared the news on Instagram on Monday, December 21, 2020. "More than just an 11:11 wish, you're an answered prayer. I love you @davejlamar, always have and always will," Morissette wrote, sharing photos of them both, while donning her engagement ring. Morissette, 24, said that the proposal happened a few months ago, with friends and family the first to know. "Nine years since we've met, bestfriends for seven, our second round at love, each other's firsts.. and now, last and only... It's definitely a Y E S to a forever with you!" she added. "Honestly, It still blows my mind how much God guided our path toward each other and the things He did to get us to where we are today. And now this. Thank you for saying yes to a lifetime of adventures with me," he wrote. "I know everyone says this, but you have truly been my best friend and my rock, and I am so so excited that I will get to marry my best friend. Morissette, Thank you for being mine! Gihigugma tika," he added. Morissette and Dave were both on The Voice of the Philippines Season 1 in 2013.

==Vocal profile==
Morissette's vocal type is a [[lyric soprano]] with five octaves and four notes (G{{music|#}}2 – C6 – D8), making her the singer that has the widest known vocal range in the Philippines.

One of Morissette's most distinctive vocal features is her ability to sing in the [[whistle register]] with ease. Morissette revealed in an interview that [[Mariah Carey]] served as an inspiration to develop her talent in whistling,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2014/09/14/1368802/mariahs-influence-todays-artists|title=Mariah's influence on today's artists|work=The Philippine Star|access-date=March 12, 2017}}</ref> and to date she has done numerous performances of Mariah's songs. To showcase her talent, Morissette occasionally adds whistle notes when doing covers, and songs from her debut album also include whistles.<ref>{{Citation|last=kerstine km8|title=MORISSETTE AMON-Whistle Compilation Part 1|date=October 24, 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JejkIaFcOc0|access-date=March 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=kerstine km8|title=MORISSETTE AMON-whistle compilation part 2|date=November 1, 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNHJ1C5WGOQ|access-date=March 19, 2017}}</ref> Another distinctive feature is her use of intentional [[Voice break|vocal breaks]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://makingtheartiste.wordpress.com/tag/morissette-amon/|title=morissette amon|website=makingtheartiste.wordpress.com|access-date=March 19, 2017}}</ref> which sound like high-pitched squeaks. This technique is used by some singers to add expression to their singing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cvtresearch.com/vocal-breaks/|title=Description and sound of Breaks|website=cvtresearch.com|date=June 4, 2014|access-date=March 14, 2017}}</ref>

Cast as one of ''ASAP's'' "Birit" Queens (literally "Belter" Queens), most of her performances revolve around songs that require [[Belting (music)|belting]]. This has led her to being described as a power belter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dailypostal.com/2016/05/29/filipino-power-belters-angeline-morissette-jona-klarisse-perform-asap-video/|title=Filipino Power Belters Angeline, Morissette, Jona, and Klarisse Perform on ASAP (VIDEO)|last=admin|date=May 29, 2016|website=Daily Postal|access-date=March 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.psst.ph/morissette-amon-wish-music-awards/|title=Morissette Amon dominates the 2nd Wish Music Awards|last=Guinto|first=Axl|website=PSST Ph}}</ref> However, Morissette has admitted that she wants to go beyond her stereotype as a belter, and has taken some opportunities to do so by performing songs not usually identified with her, such as in her debut solo concert<ref name=":13" /> and her Stages Sessions mini-concert.<ref name=":12" />

Jonathan Manalo, the head of Star Records' audio content, has been quoted as saying "Morissette is not just like any traditional diva who can hit high notes. She has a very distinct tone that can adapt to many music genres. And that versatility is something that we will showcase in her debut album with us".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://astig.ph/morissette-amon-clone-sarah-geronimo/|title=Morissette Amon: I am more than a clone of Sarah Geronimo|date=August 15, 2014|work=ASTIG.PH|access-date=March 19, 2017}}</ref> It was during the process of creating her debut album when Morissette's record company discovered that aside from belting she had the ability to whistle and asked her to include it in the album.<ref name=":12" />
