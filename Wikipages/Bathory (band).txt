'''Bathory''' were a Swedish [[black metal]] band formed in [[Vällingby]] in March 1983. Named after Hungarian [[countess]] [[Elizabeth Báthory]], they are considered pioneers of [[black metal]] and [[Viking metal]].

Bathory abandoned the black metal sound for their fifth record, ''[[Hammerheart]]'' (1990), which is often cited as the first Viking metal album.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Maisano|first1=Anthony|title=Today in Metal: 'Hammerheart' by Bathory turns 24 years old|url=http://www.metalinsider.net/today-in-metal/today-in-metal-hammerheart-by-bathory-turns-24-years-old|website=Metalinsider.net|access-date=20 May 2016}}</ref> Bathory continued in the Viking metal style for most of their remaining existence, although they experimented with a [[thrash metal]] style on the albums ''[[Requiem (Bathory album)|Requiem]]'' (1994) and ''[[Octagon (Bathory album)|Octagon]]'' (1995). They stopped performing live early on and never toured; 
frontman, founder and main songwriter [[Quorthon|Tomas "Quorthon" Forsberg]] was the sole constant member and at times responsible for all instruments. Bathory ended when Forsberg died from [[heart failure]] at the age of 38 in 2004.

== History ==
=== Early years (1980s) ===
Bathory formed in [[Vällingby]] in March 1983.<ref name="lahtinen" /> [[Quorthon]], a 17-year-old guitarist (then known as "Ace Shoot", a name inspired by sex jokes, two [[Motörhead]] songs – [[Ace of Spades (song)|Ace of Spades]] and Sharpshooter<ref name="names-rumors-legends">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bathory.nu/htmlbathory/02_kap.htm|title=Bathory – Names rumors legends music and image|website=Bathory.nu|access-date=6 October 2020}}</ref> – and [[Ace Frehley]] of [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]), was joined by bass guitarist Frederick Melander ("Hanoi"<ref name="names-rumors-legends" />) and drummer [[Jonas Åkerlund]] ("Vans McBurger"<ref name="names-rumors-legends" />). According to Quorthon, he settled on the name 'Bathory' after a visit to the [[London Dungeon]], although Jonas says that it was also inspired and taken from the [[Venom (band)|Venom]] song "[[Countess Bathory (song)|Countess Bathory]]".{{sfn|Johannesson|Klingberg|2011|pp=52–62}} The Venom song was based on the life of [[Elizabeth Báthory]] who is believed to be the most prolific female murderesses. Before settling on 'Bathory', the band considered several names; including Nosferatu, Natas, Mephisto, Elizabeth Bathory and Countess Bathory.<ref name=Santos>{{cite book |last=Santos |first=José Carlos |year=2009 |title=Terrorizer's Secret History of Black Metal |publisher=Dark Arts Ltd |pages=10–11}}</ref> Quorthon worked part-time at the small record label [[Tyfon Grammofon]], which was owned by his father, Börje Forsberg.{{sfn|Johannesson|Klingberg|2011|pp=52–62}} In late 1983, the label was putting together a compilation of songs by [[Scandinavia]]n metal bands.{{sfn|Ekeroth|2008|p=29}} However, at the last minute, one of the bands backed out. Tyfon agreed to let Bathory appear on the record as a replacement. The album, called ''[[:fi:Scandinavian Metal Attack|Scandinavian Metal Attack]]'', was released in March 1984 and was Bathory's first appearance on record.{{sfn|Ekeroth|2008|p=30}} Unexpectedly, the two Bathory tracks "Sacrifice" and "The Return of Darkness and Evil" drew a great deal of fan mail.<ref>{{cite web |last=McManus |first=Peter |date=1987 |title=Stranger than Strange – Quorthon Uncloacks His Secrets in an Exclusive Interview... |work=Power Metal |url=http://ritesoftheblackmoon.tripod.com/interview_bathory.html |access-date=8 September 2012 |archive-date=12 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112031552/http://ritesoftheblackmoon.tripod.com/interview_bathory.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Soon afterward, Tyfon asked Quorthon to record a full-length album.{{sfn|Ekeroth|2008|p=30}} His bandmates having moved away, Quorthon recruited Rickard Bergman from his former [[Oi Punk|oi-punk]] band [[Stridskuk]] as bassist and Stefan Larsson from punk band Obsklass as drummer.<ref name="Bathory – Bathory">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bathory.nu/htmlbathory/05_kap.htm|title=Bathory – Bathory|website=bathory.nu|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> On 22 May 1984, they had their first and only rehearsal together before recording the album.{{sfn|Ekeroth|2008|p=30}} Two songs were recorded at the 22 May rehearsal: "Witchcraft" and "Satan My Master" making it the first recording of the debut album line-up.<ref name="Bathory – Bathory"/> The debut album, ''[[Bathory (album)|Bathory]]'', was recorded in June at Heavenshore Studio (a converted garage) in [[Stockholm]]{{sfn|Ekeroth|2008|p=30}} and released in October that year. Over the next four years, Bathory released a further three albums: ''[[The Return……]]'' (1985), ''[[Under the Sign of the Black Mark]]'' (1987) and ''[[Blood Fire Death]]'' (1988).

Bathory's early work was dark, fast, heavily distorted and raw recording ([[lo-fi music|lo-fi]]). Quorthon's vocals were [[death growl|harsh]], high-pitched and raspy with occasional shrieks and screams. The band's lyrics focused on 'dark' topics and included anti-Christian and '[[Satanism|Satanic]]' references.<ref name=bathory-lyrics>{{cite web |url=http://bathory.nu/08/08_writing_the_deeds_of_darkness_and_evil.htm |title=Writing the deeds of Darkness and Evil |publisher=Official Bathory website |access-date=29 October 2012}}</ref> These traits came to define [[black metal]]<ref name=Santos/> and the band used this style on their first four albums. Quorthon said that the band were not Satanists but used 'Satanic' references to provoke and attack Christianity. With the third and fourth albums he began "attacking Christianity from a different angle", realizing that Satanism is a "Christian product" and seeing them both as "religious hocus-pocus".<ref name=bathory-lyrics/>

Quorthon described Bathory's early sound as a "mixture" of [[Black Sabbath]], [[Motörhead]] and [[GBH (band)|GBH]],<ref name="lahtinen" /> singling out GBH's ''[[City Baby Attacked by Rats]]'' and Motörhead's ''[[Ace of Spades (album)|Ace of Spades]]'' and ''[[Iron Fist (album)|Iron Fist]]'',<ref name="death-metal-org">DeathMetal.org: [http://www.deathmetal.org/interview/quorthon-bathory/ Interview: Quorthon (Bathory)]</ref> and was also influenced by [[the Exploited]],<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jRRvfWp95FIC&pg=PA27 Swedish Death Metal]'': "If I hadn't started to play in punk bands around '79–80 I could have ended up on the streets, with a needle in my arm. Luckily, I didn't have any such friends, so I got involved with the punk movement, and was inspired by bands like Exploited and GBH."</ref> [[Sex Pistols]], [[Disorder (band)|Disorder]], [[Riot/Clone]], [[Anti-Nowhere League]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]],<ref>[http://www.bathory.nu/htmlbathory/01kap_b.htm "Birth of a Legend"].

Bathory stopped performing live in 1985, with Quorthon viewing organizing concerts as too much hassle.<ref name=Santos/>

Although Bathory's fourth album, ''Blood Fire Death'' (1988), largely followed in the style of the albums before it, some songs had a very different style. These songs have a much slower tempo, acoustic passages, choral background singing, and lyrics about [[Vikings]] and [[Norse mythology]]. Music critic Eduardo Rivadavia of [[AllMusic]] describes this 'epic' style as "possibly the first true example" of [[Viking metal]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Rivadavia |first=Eduardo |title=Blood Fire Death – Bathory : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards : AllMusic |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=blood-fire-death-mw0000171761|pure_url=yes}} |access-date=16 February 2013}}</ref>

=== Viking metal years (1990s–2000s) ===
After ''Blood Fire Death'', the band shed its early black metal style. Their fifth album, ''[[Hammerheart]]'' (1990), was the first "archetypical Viking metal album".<ref name="Hammerheart AllMusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=hammerheart-mw0000312318|pure_url=yes}} |title=Hammerheart – Bathory : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards : AllMusic |last=Rivadavia |first=Eduardo |publisher=AllMusic|access-date=8 September 2012}}</ref> This was said to have been influenced by the American [[power metal]] band [[Manowar]], although Quorthon described this rumour as "another total misconception".<ref name="anus"/> A [[music video]] was made for the song "[[One Rode to Asa Bay]]". The style of ''Hammerheart'' was continued on ''[[Twilight of the Gods (album)|Twilight of the Gods]]'' (1991) and ''[[Blood on Ice]]'' (recorded in 1989 but completed in 1996).

With ''[[Requiem (Bathory album)|Requiem]]'' (1994) and ''[[Octagon (Bathory album)|Octagon]]'' (1995), Bathory changed style once more, this time turning to retro-[[thrash metal|thrash]] in the vein of 1980s [[Bay Area thrash metal|Bay Area thrash]] bands. However, the 2001 release ''[[Destroyer of Worlds (album)|Destroyer of Worlds]]'' was a transitional release that led to a full return to the Viking metal style with the releases of ''[[Nordland I]]'' (2002) and ''[[Nordland II]]'' (2003).

=== Quorthon's death ===
In June 2004, Quorthon was found dead in his home, apparently due to heart failure.<ref name=Santos/> He was known to suffer from heart problems in the past. On 3 June 2006, [[Black Mark Production]] released a box set in tribute to Quorthon, containing three CDs of his favorite Bathory and Quorthon songs, a 176-page booklet, a [[DVD]] with his long-form video for "One Rode to Asa Bay", an interview and some rare promo footage and a poster.

Several Bathory tribute albums have been compiled by black metal artists, such as ''In Conspiracy with Satan – A Tribute to Bathory'' and ''Voices from Valhalla – A Tribute to Bathory''. In August 2004, several members of the [[Early Norwegian black metal scene|Norwegian black metal scene]] gathered to perform Bathory songs in a set titled ''A Tribute to Quorthon'' at the [[Hole in the Sky]] Festival in Bergen, Norway. These musicians included [[Olve Eikemo|Abbath]] ([[Immortal (band)|Immortal]]), [[Ole Moe|Apollyon]] ([[Aura Noir]]), [[Faust (musician)|Faust]] and [[Samoth]] ([[Emperor (band)|Emperor]] and [[Zyklon]]), [[Gaahl]] ([[Gorgoroth]]), [[Grutle Kjellson]] and [[Ivar Bjørnson]] ([[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]]), [[Nocturno Culto]] ([[Darkthrone]]) and [[Sigurd Wongraven|Satyr]] ([[Satyricon (band)|Satyricon]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=8269|title=Norway's Black Metal Elite To Pay Tribute To Quorthon|website=metalunderground.com|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
The Swedish black metal band [[Watain]] played a live tribute to [[Quorthon]] and the band Bathory at the Sweden Rock Festival 2010. The resulting recording was the limited-edition album ''Tonight We Raise Our Cups and Toast in Angels Blood: A Tribute to Bathory'' with 7 tracks, and was released on 23 February 2015. It was also released as 12" album, the latter in 1300 numbered copies with four tracks, "A Fine Day to Die" (10:48), "The Return of Darkness and Evil" (4:36), "Rite of Darkness" (2:19) and "Reaper" (2:46) on Side A and three tracks "Enter the Eternal Fire" (7:14), "Sacrifice" (4:06) and "Born for Burning" (7:11) on Side B.

The release proved very popular with Swedish public, with the limited vinyl edition reaching number 1 on the vinyl chart. The album made it also to number 2 on the national [[Sverigetopplistan]] chart, the official Swedish Albums Chart in February 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bravewords.com/news/watain-hit-national-chart-in-sweden-with-tonight-we-raise-our-cups-and-toast-in-angels-blood-limited-lp|title=WATAIN Hit National Chart in Sweden With Tonight We Raise Our Cups And Toast in Angels Blood Limited LP|website=Bravewords.com|access-date=1 October 2018}}</ref>
