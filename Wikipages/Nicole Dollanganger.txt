==Career==

=== 2010–2014: Career beginnings ===
Dollanganger first began writing, producing, and recording music in 2010. She recorded original songs, as well as covers, in her bedroom and bathroom<ref name=":13">{{Cite web|date=November 25, 2012|title=Flowers of Flesh and Blood, by Nicole Dollanganger|url=https://nicoledollanganger.bandcamp.com/album/flowers-of-flesh-and-blood|url-status=live|access-date=2021-03-09|website=[[Bandcamp]]}}</ref><ref name=":14"/> on her [[MacBook]], using the digital audio software [[GarageBand]].<ref name=":62" /> In 2011, Dollanganger began posting her music on [[Tumblr]] (where she also posted her visual artwork), [[Myspace]], and [[Bandcamp]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /><ref name=":9" /> Many of the original songs she posted would later be included as tracks on her 2012 debut album, ''Curdled Milk''.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":6">{{Cite web|date=July 13, 2012|title=Curdled Milk, by Nicole Dollanganger|url=https://nicoledollanganger.bandcamp.com/album/curdled-milk|url-status=live|access-date=2021-03-09|website=[[Bandcamp]]}}</ref>

''Curdled Milk'', written, produced, and recorded entirely by Dollanganger in 2011 and early 2012, was self-released online as her debut album and first record on July 13, 2012.<ref name=":6" /> She created the artwork used on the album cover (as well as two alternative album covers, featuring a photograph she took of herself and drew onto.) Shortly after releasing the album, Dollanganger was admitted to a hospital program as she was suffering from [[anorexia nervosa]], [[anorexia athletica]], and [[bulimia nervosa]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Doran|first=Elizabeth|date=2019-07-16|title=Singer Nicole Dollanganger posts about Bianca Devins murder|url=https://www.syracuse.com/crime/2019/07/singer-nicole-dollanganger-posts-about-bianca-devins-murder-asks-people-to-stop-sharing-photos.html|url-status=live|access-date=2021-03-09|website=Syracuse.com|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":12">{{Cite web|last=Downie|first=Jason|title=The Haunting Storytelling Of Nicole Dollanganger|url=https://vocal.media/beat/the-haunting-storytelling-of-nicole-dollanganger|url-status=live|access-date=2021-03-09|website=Beat|language=en}}</ref> (She later revealed that she had been struggling with the disorders while making ''Curdled Milk''.)

{{Blockquote
|text="[''Curdled Milk'']'s creation coincided with an illness I was battling, and right after I released it, I went on bed rest for a year & completely shut the world out. I could probably count on my hands how many times I left the house throughout that year, actually. And after that period, I was a completely different person. Everything in my life had changed and I think for the first time I kind of came into myself. In that regard, I feel I have changed a lot."

Dollanganger continued creating music and posting her work online. In November 2012 she self-released her second album, ''Flowers of Flesh and Blood''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Fanty|first=Bianca|date=2016-10-11|title=Review: Flowers Of Flesh And Blood By Nicole Dollanganger|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/flowers-flesh-blood-nicole-dollanganger|url-status=live|access-date=2021-03-09|website=The Odyssey Online|language=en-us}}</ref> On February 20, 2013, Dollanganger would release her third album, ''Ode to Dawn Wiener: Embarrassing Love Songs''.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":11" /><ref name=":14">{{Cite web|date=February 20, 2013|title=Ode to Dawn Wiener: Embarrassing Love Songs, by Nicole Dollanganger|url=https://nicoledollanganger.bandcamp.com/album/ode-to-dawn-wiener-embarrassing-love-songs|url-status=live|access-date=2021-03-09|website=[[Bandcamp]]}}</ref>

On January 10, 2014, Dollanganger released her fourth album, ''Observatory Mansions''.<ref name=":16">{{Cite web|date=January 10, 2014|title=Observatory Mansions, by Nicole Dollanganger|url=https://nicoledollanganger.bandcamp.com/album/observatory-mansions|url-status=live|access-date=2021-03-09|website=[[Bandcamp]]}}</ref> The title of the nine-track album was adopted from ''Observatory Mansions'', the 2000 debut novel by English novelist [[Edward Carey (novelist)|Edward Carey]].<ref name=":16" /> The album was recorded in 2013 and would be the last record Dollanganger would write, produce, and record entirely on her own. Around a month prior the album's release, on December 9, 2013, Dollanganger had posted on social media a tentative track list for an untitled record she was working on — the record would later be revealed to be ''Observatory Mansions'', but the seventh track on the tentative track list, "Hymns for the Small Towns", was not included on the album. "Hymns for the Small Towns" is since unreleased.

Dollanganger hand-made a limited number of physical copies of her first four records (on [[cassette tape]] format and [[CD-R|CD-R disc]] format), intending to sell them.

===2015–2016: Eerie Organization and ''Natural Born Losers''===
in 2015, Dollanganger, alongside Canadian singer and musician [[Grimes (musician)|Grimes]], opened for American singer-songwriter [[Lana Del Rey]] at a Toronto concert.
