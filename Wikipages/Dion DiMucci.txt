'''Dion Francis DiMucci'''<ref name=allmusicbio /> (born July 18, 1939),<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2019/07/18/Famous-birthdays-for-July-18-Vin-Diesel-Kristen-Bell/8771563155558/|title=Famous birthdays for July 18: Vin Diesel, Kristen Bell|agency=[[United Press International]]|date=July 18, 2019|access-date=August 7, 2019|archive-date=July 19, 2019|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190719181941/https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2019/07/18/Famous-birthdays-for-July-18-Vin-Diesel-Kristen-Bell/8771563155558/|url-status=live|quote=Pop singer Dion DiMucci in 1939 (age 80)}}</ref> better known [[Mononymous person|mononymously]] as '''Dion''', is an American singer and songwriter whose music has incorporated elements of [[doo-wop]], [[rock music|rock]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[blues]]. Initially as lead singer of [[Dion and the Belmonts]], and then in his solo career, he was one of the most popular American [[rock and roll]] performers of the pre-[[British Invasion]] era. He had 39 Top 40 hits in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a solo performer, with the Belmonts or with [[the Del-Satins]]. He is best remembered for the singles "[[Runaround Sue]]", "[[The Wanderer (Dion song)|The Wanderer]]", "[[Ruby Baby]]" and "[[Lovers Who Wander]]", among other hits.

Dion's popularity waned in the mid-1960s.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} Toward the end of the decade, he shifted his style and produced songs that were more mature and contemplative, such as "[[Abraham, Martin and John]]". He remained popular in the late 1960s until the mid-1970s{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} and has continued making music since. During the 1980s, Dion produced [[#Mature and Christian period: 1969–1986|several Christian albums]]. He returned to [[secular music]] in the late 1980s with ''[[Yo Frankie (album)|Yo Frankie]]'' (1989). Between the mid-2000s and 2020, Dion released five blues albums.<ref>{{cite web | title=Dion | website=Billboard | url=https://www.billboard.com/music/dion/chart-history/BLU | access-date=October 7, 2021}}</ref> Critics who had dismissed his early work, labeling him as a [[teen idol]], praised his later work and noted the influence he has had on other musicians.<ref name=allmusicbio>{{cite web|first=Richie|last=Unterberger|quote=his critical rep has risen steadily since the early '60s, with many noted contemporary musicians showering him with praise and citing his influence.|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dion-mn0000265456/biography|title=Dion Biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=August 20, 2014}}</ref>

Dion was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1989.

== Early life ==
Dion was born to an [[Italian Americans|Italian-American]] family in [[the Bronx]], New York.<ref>{{cite news |work=The New York Times |title=A Wanderer, Dion Returns to His Roots |author=Sam Howe Vaerhovek |date= June 19, 1987 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/19/nyregion/a-wanderer-dion-returns-to-his-roots.html }}</ref> As a child, he accompanied his father, Pasquale DiMucci, a [[vaudeville]] entertainer, on tour, and developed a love of [[country music]] – particularly the work of [[Hank Williams]]. He also developed a fondness for the [[blues]] and [[doo-wop]] musicians he heard performing in local bars and on the radio. His singing was honed on the street corners and local clubs of the Bronx, where he and other neighborhood singers created [[a cappella]] riffs.
 
In early 1957, he auditioned for Bob and Gene Schwartz for their short-lived Mohawk Records label. They asked Dion to sing a song which had been arranged by [[Hugo Montenegro]] and recorded featuring Vic Damone doing vocals. At first Dion refused, stating the song would sound like something his old fashioned parents would listen to, but the Schwartzes convinced him to give it a try. The backing vocals were by a group called "the Timberlanes", whom Dion had never met.<ref>DiMucci, Dion with Davin Seay: ''The Wanderer – Dion's Story.'' Beach Tree, 1988, p. 58</ref> The resulting single, "The Chosen Few", was released under the name "Dion and the Timberlanes", and became a minor regional hit. Dion himself stated in 2019 during an interview at "Crashing the Party" (a [[radio program]] related to [[Norton Records]] in Brooklyn, New York) that "The Chosen Few" hit the Top Ten locally in Boston and enabled him to perform this song on ''[[American Bandstand]]'' where the kids at the show started screaming during his performance, which gave him his first impression of being a record star. Writing about this experience later, in his autobiography, ''The Wanderer'', Dion said that he had never met the Timberlanes and did not even know who they were. "The vocal group was so white bread, I went back to my neighborhood and I recruited a bunch of guys – three guys – and we called ourselves Dion and the Belmonts."<ref name="furious1">{{cite web|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/dion.html |title=Perfect Sound Forever: Dion speaks of the blues |publisher=Furious.com |date=February 3, 1959 |access-date=February 6, 2013}}</ref>

== Career ==

=== With the Belmonts: 1957–1960 ===
{{Main|Dion and the Belmonts}}
Bob and Gene Schwartz also signed Dion's friends, [[the Belmonts]] ([[Carlo Mastrangelo]], [[Fred Milano]], and Angelo D'Aleo), a vocal group named for the [[Belmont, Bronx]] neighborhood, and teamed them up with Dion singing lead. The new group's breakthrough came in early 1958, when "[[I Wonder Why]]" (on their newly formed [[Laurie Records]]) made No. 22 on the U.S. charts. Dion said of the Belmonts; "I'd give 'em sounds. I'd give 'em parts and stuff. That's what 'I Wonder Why' was about. We kind of invented this percussive rhythmic sound. If you listen to that song, everybody was doing something different. There's four guys, one guy was doing bass, I was singing lead, one guy's going 'ooh wah ooh,' and another guy's doing tenor. It was totally amazing. When I listen to it today, oftentimes I think, 'man, those kids are talented.'"<ref name="furious1" />

Their initial hit was followed by "[[No One Knows (Dion and The Belmonts song)|No One Knows]]" and "Don't Pity Me", which also charted the ''Billboard'' Top 100. This success won a place for Dion and the Belmonts on the ill-fated "The Winter Dance Party" tour with [[Buddy Holly]], [[Ritchie Valens]], [[the Big Bopper]] (J.P. Richardson), [[Frankie Sardo]], and other performers. On February 3, 1959, after a concert stop in [[Clear Lake, Iowa]], Holly and others decided to charter a flight to the next venue rather than travel on the tour bus. Dion was invited to accompany the group but decided that he did not want to spend $36 for the flight, as it was the same monthly rent his parents paid for his childhood apartment and he could not justify the indulgence.<ref>DiMucci, Dion: ''The Wanderer,'' page 89. Beech Tree Books, 1988</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/04/entertainment/buddy-holly-plane-crash-reexamined/index.html |title=Buddy Holly plane crash may be re-examined |date=March 4, 2015 |last1=Hetter |first1=Katia |last2=Marsh |first2=Rene |work=CNN|access-date=March 4, 2015}}</ref> [[The Day the Music Died|The plane crashed]], killing all on board: Holly, Valens, Richardson, and the pilot Roger Peterson. Dion and the Belmonts continued on the tour, along with [[Frankie Sardo]], while [[Bobby Vee]], then an unknown artist, performed in Holly's place at the very next concert. Later, [[Jimmy Clanton]], [[Frankie Avalon]], and [[Fabian Forte|Fabian]] were added to replace the other now-deceased headliners.

Dion and the Belmonts' next single, "[[A Teenager in Love]]", was released in March 1959, eventually hitting No. 5 on the U.S. pop charts and No. 28 in the UK.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

However, in early 1960, Dion checked into hospital for heroin addiction, a problem he had had since his mid-teens.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dion DiMucci: Biography, Life, Facts and Songs|url=http://www.famoussingers.org/dion-dimucci|website=FamousSingers.org|access-date=August 26, 2015}}</ref> Further single releases for the group that year were less successful.  There were musical, personal and financial differences between Dion and members of the Belmonts, and in October 1960, Dion decided to quit for a solo career. By the time of their breakup, all eight Laurie releases had charted on the Hot 100.

=== Solo stardom and touring: 1960–1964 ===
By the end of 1960, Dion had released his first solo album on Laurie, ''Alone with Dion'', and the single "[[Lonely Teenager (song)|Lonely Teenager]]", which rose to No. 12 in the US charts. The name on his solo releases was simply "Dion". Follow-ups "Havin' Fun" and "Kissin' Game" had less success, and the signs were that Dion would drift onto the cabaret circuit. However, he then recorded, with a new vocal group, [[the Del-Satins]], an up-tempo number co-written with [[Ernie Maresca]]. The record, "[[Runaround Sue]]", stormed up the U.S. charts, reaching No. 1 in October 1961, and No. 11 in the UK,<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums" /> where he also toured. "Runaround Sue" sold over a million copies, achieving [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] status.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Murrells|year=1978|title=The Book of Golden Discs|edition=2nd|publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/134 134]|isbn=0-214-20512-6|url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/134}}</ref>

For the next single, Laurie promoted the A-side, "The Majestic", but it was the B-side, Maresca's "[[The Wanderer (Dion song)|The Wanderer]]", which received more radio play and climbed swiftly up the charts to reach No. 2 in the U.S. in February 1962 and No. 10 in the UK. The 1976 re-release made the UK Top 20.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums" />

By the end of 1961, Dion had become a major star, touring worldwide and making an appearance in the [[Columbia Pictures]] musical film ''[[Twist Around the Clock]]''. In 1962, he followed with a string of singles he wrote or co-wrote including "[[Lovers Who Wander]]" (No. 3), "[[Little Diane]]" (No. 8), "[[Love Came to Me]]" (No. 10). He also had successful albums with ''Runaround Sue'' and ''Lovers Who Wander''.

At the end of 1962, Dion moved from Laurie to [[Columbia Records]]; he was the first rock and roll artist signed to the label, which was an anomaly considering that its then-A&R director, [[Mitch Miller]], loathed that particular genre of music. The first Columbia single, [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller]]'s "[[Ruby Baby]]" (originally a hit for [[the Drifters]]) reached No. 2, while "[[Donna the Prima Donna]]" and "[[Drip Drop (Leiber and Stoller song)|Drip Drop]]" (another remake of a Drifters hit) both reached No. 6 in late 1963. (Dion also recorded an Italian version of "Donna the Prima Donna" using the identical backup vocals.) His other Columbia releases were less successful, and problems with his addiction and changing public tastes, especially the [[British Invasion]], saw a period of commercial decline.

=== Belmont reunion and Laurie Records: 1965–1968 ===
Following a European tour, Dion returned to the U.S. and was introduced to classic [[blues]] by Columbia's [[John Hammond (record producer)|John Hammond]]. To the consternation of his management, he began recording more blues-oriented material, including [[Willie Dixon]]'s "[[Hoochie Coochie Man]]" and "[[Spoonful]]", but these releases – some produced by [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]], with [[Al Kooper]] on keyboards – were not commercially successful. In 1965, still with Columbia, Dion formed a new group to back him, The Wanderers, composed of John Falbo on guitar, Pete Baron (Pete Falciglia) on bass, and [[Carlo Mastrangelo]] of [[the Belmonts]] on drums. They made national appearances on [[Dick Clark]]'s, ''Where The Action Is'', and ''[[Lloyd Thaxton|The Lloyd Thaxton Show]]''. A number of self-penned tracks were recorded and released unsuccessfully as singles, and did not appear in album format until years later. In June 1965 he recorded fellow Columbia Records's contemporary [[Bob Dylan]]'s composition "[[It's All Over Now, Baby Blue]]" a half-year before [[Them (band)|Them]] (featuring [[Van Morrison]])'s hit version.

In 1966–67, Dion briefly reunited with the Belmonts, recording the LP ''Together Again'' for [[ABC Records]]. The album was unsuccessful, despite one classic self-penned song, "My Girl the Month of May". Two singles were released from the LP. While neither charted in the United States, they fared better in the UK. "My Girl The Month of May" entered the [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]] "[[Fab 40]]" at No. 9 the week of December 25, 1966. A 'turntable' hit at London underground clubs like [[Middle Earth (club)|Middle Earth]], the disc received a lot of play from [[pirate radio]] DJ's [[John Peel]] and [[Kenny Everett]]. The follow up, "Movin' Man", reached No. 17 on the "Radio London" charts on Easter Sunday, March 26, 1967. "My Girl The Month of May" was later covered by English artists [[Alan Bown]] in 1967, and [[Island Records]] artists [[The Bunch]] (featuring [[Sandy Denny]] and other members of [[Fairport Convention]]) in April 1972. During their brief mid-60's reunion, Dion and the Belmonts appeared on the popular ''Clay Cole Show'' performing "Berimbau" and "My Girl The Month of May", and occasionally performed at local New York City clubs such as "The Mardi Gras" on Staten Island (April 29, 1967) before disbanding. While Dion's career appeared to be nearing an end, he still retained enough credibility to be, along with Bob Dylan, one of only two rock artists featured on the album cover of [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' in 1967.<ref>{{cite web|last=Streeter|first=Leslie Gray|title=Who is the Boca Raton man on cover of Beatles ‘Sgt.

In April 1968, Dion experienced what he identified as a powerful religious transformation.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}} After getting clean once again from [[heroin]] [[addiction]], an experience he documented in his 1970 song "Your Own Backyard", he approached [[Laurie Records]] for a new contract. They agreed on condition that he record the song "[[Abraham, Martin & John]]", written by [[Dick Holler]] (also the writer of [[the Royal Guardsmen]]'s "Snoopy Vs. The Red Baron") in response to the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] on November 22, 1963, and those of [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King Jr.]] and [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Robert F. Kennedy]] during the spring of 1968. The success of this song (released by Dion in August 1968 and later recorded by many others including [[Marvin Gaye]]) which reached No. 4 in the US charts and No. 1 in Canada, resuscitated Dion's career. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs 2">{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Murrells|year=1978|title=The Book of Golden Discs|edition=2nd|publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/238 238]|isbn=0-214-20512-6|url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/238}}</ref>

=== Mature and Christian period: 1969–1986 ===
For the next few years, Dion's music became radically different, moving to more contemplative and mature material. He released several albums essentially as a singer-songwriter, to moderate sales, moving to the [[Warner Brothers]] label in 1969.

There followed a live reunion show with [[the Belmonts]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] on June 2, 1972, which was recorded and released as a live album by Warner. A year later, in 1973, Dion and the original Belmonts performed once more, doing a sold-out concert at the Nassau Coliseum on Long Island, New York. However, no recording of the 1973 reunion was released. This was followed in 1975 by the album ''[[Born to Be with You (album)|Born to Be with You]]'' produced by [[Phil Spector]]. The album was a commercial failure, but has been subsequently praised by such artists as [[Jason Pierce]] of [[Spiritualized]] and [[Pete Townshend]] of [[The Who]] and the track "Only You Know" was sampled by [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]] frontman [[Jarvis Cocker]] for his single "[[Don't Let Him Waste Your Time]]" from his 2006 solo album ''[[Jarvis (album)|Jarvis]]''.

In 1978, Dion released an album drawing on many of his teenage influences, ''Return of the Wanderer'', another commercial failure.

In December 1979, there was a radical spiritual change in Dion, who had become a [[born again]] [[Christians|Christian]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ecceagnusdei.blogspot.com/2005/06/spiritual-journey-of-wanderer-who-came.html |title=Communion in the Hand? : The Spiritual Journey of the Wanderer Who Came Home By Dion Dimucci |publisher=Ecceagnusdei.blogspot.com |date=June 20, 2005 |access-date=August 20, 2014}}</ref> Thereafter, his recordings for several years were in a [[contemporary Christian music|contemporary Christian]] vein, in which he released five albums on the [[Word Records|DaySpring Records]] label, a division of Word Records in [[Waco, Texas]]. These albums reflecting his [[Evangelism|evangelical]] Christian convictions were ''Inside Job'' (1980), ''Only Jesus'' (1981), ''I Put Away My Idols'' (1983) which charted at No. 37, ''Seasons'' (1984), ''Kingdom in the Streets'' (1985) and ''Velvet & Steel'' (1986). Several singles were successfully released to [[Christian radio]], notably "Still in the Spirit" from ''Kingdom in the Streets''.

In 1984, Dion won the [[GMA Dove Award]] (Christian Music Award) for the album ''I Put Away My Idols''. He was also nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Gospel Vocal Performance, Male]] for the same album.

On September 24, 1985, Dion was a guest on ''[[100 Huntley Street]]''.

=== Return to secular music and RRHOF induction: 1987–1999 ===
In 1987, Dion agreed to do a concert of his old hits at [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York. The two disc CD of this concert was released in 2005, featuring concert photos by Dion's friend, Michael J. Friedman. This concert helped free him to celebrate both his past and his future, and led to a series of special appearances, including a fundraiser for homeless medical relief. There he shared the stage with fans such as [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Paul Simon]] and [[Lou Reed]], all of whom cited Dion as one of their prime influences.

In 1988, Dion's autobiography (co-authored by Davin Seay) titled ''The Wanderer: Dion's Story'' was published.

In 1989, DiMucci returned to rock music with the contemporary album ''[[Yo Frankie (album)|Yo Frankie]]'', which included appearances by Paul Simon, Lou Reed, [[k.d. lang]], [[Patty Smyth]] and [[Bryan Adams]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/yo-frankie-255325/|title=Yo Frankie!|first1=David|last1=Browne|date=June 15, 1989|accessdate=July 7, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/yo-frankie-mw0000198941|title=Yo Frankie - Dion &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits &#124; AllMusic|accessdate=July 7, 2021|via=www.allmusic.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Dion-Yo-Frankie/release/1055653|title=Dion – Yo Frankie (1989, Vinyl)|accessdate=July 7, 2021|via=www.discogs.com}}</ref> Produced by [[Dave Edmunds]] (who also played guitar on the album), "''Yo Frankie'' has a sharp sound while never losing sight of Dion's soulful, [[doo-wop]] voice."<ref>{{cite web|author=Call Us Free: 1-800-800-0800 |url=http://www.buy.com/prod/yo-frankie/q/loc/109/61703991.html |title=Yo Frankie CD |publisher=Buy.com |access-date=May 9, 2012}}</ref> Overall, "the relevant and nostalgic statement from an artist who helped forge rock & roll's first wave" found his way back on radio and in music videos during this period (both on [[VH1]] and [[MTV]]), as well as touring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/dion/59131/and-the-night-stood-still.jhtml |title=And The Night Stood Still &#124; Music Video |publisher=MTV |date=January 1, 1989 |access-date=August 20, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821012605/http://www.mtv.com/videos/dion/59131/and-the-night-stood-still.jhtml |archive-date=August 21, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/dion_the_belmonts/albums.jhtml?albumId=36515 |title=Yo Frankie by Dion |publisher=MTV |date=January 1, 1989 |access-date=August 20, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/dimucci_dion/artist.jhtml |title=Dion DiMucci &#124; MTV |publisher=VH1 |access-date=August 20, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/dion/59130/written-on-the-subway-wall.jhtml#artist=5978 |title=Written on the Subway Wall &#124; Music Video |publisher=MTV |date=January 1, 1989 |access-date=August 20, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821014704/http://www.mtv.com/videos/dion/59130/written-on-the-subway-wall.jhtml |archive-date=August 21, 2014 }}</ref>

In the late 1990s, Dion visited his old [[The Bronx|Bronx]] [[Parish (Catholic Church)|parish]], [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]], and returned to [[Catholicism]].<ref>{{cite news |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/14/nyregion/14dion.html |date=May 14, 2008 |title='Wanderer' Has Given Up Wandering |author=David Gonzalez }}</ref> Sparking Dion's reversion to Catholicism was "a chance viewing of ''the Journey Home'' program on [[EWTN]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://chnetwork.org/journey-home/dion-dimucci-reveted-catholic-faith-presbyterianism-journey-home-program/|title=Dion DiMucci: Revert from Presbyterianism – The Coming Home Network|access-date=January 29, 2018}}</ref> 

DiMucci joined [[Scott Kempner]] and [[Frank Funaro]] of [[the Del-Lords]] and Mike Mesaros of [[the Smithereens]] in a short-lived band called Little Kings. A live album was later released, but not widely circulated or promoted.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Live-York-Dion-Little-Kings/dp/B00005S85M |title=Live in New York: Music |publisher=Amazon.com |access-date=August 20, 2014}}</ref>

=== Recent work and blues success: 2000–present ===
Dion has released several albums with contemporary [[rock music|rock]] artists. His ''Déjà Nu'' album in 2000 found him covering [[Bruce Springsteen]], a major follower over the years.
