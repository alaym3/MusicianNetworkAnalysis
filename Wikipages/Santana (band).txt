'''Santana''' is an American [[Rock Music|rock]] band formed in [[San Francisco]] in 1966 by [[Mexican Americans|Mexican-American]] guitarist and songwriter [[Carlos Santana]]. The band has undergone multiple recording and performing line-ups in its history, with Carlos Santana the only consistent member. Santana had early success with their appearance at [[Woodstock]] in 1969 and their first three albums, ''[[Santana (1969 album)|Santana]]'' (1969), ''[[Abraxas (album)|Abraxas]]'' (1970), and ''[[Santana (1971 album)|Santana III]]'' (1971). Other important core members during this period include [[Gregg Rolie]], [[Michael Carabello]], [[Michael Shrieve]], [[David Brown (American musician)|David Brown]], and [[José Areas|José "Chepito" Areas]], forming the "classic" line-up.

Following its initial success Santana experimented with elements of [[jazz fusion]] on ''[[Caravanserai (album)|Caravanserai]]'' (1972), ''[[Welcome (Santana album)|Welcome]]'' (1973), and ''[[Borboletta]]'' (1974). Santana reached a new peak of commercial and critical success with ''[[Supernatural (Santana album)|Supernatural]]'' (1999) and its singles "[[Smooth (Santana song)|Smooth]]", featuring singer [[Rob Thomas (musician)|Rob Thomas]], and "[[Maria Maria]]". The album reached No. 1 in eleven countries and sold 12&nbsp;million copies in the US alone. In 2014, the "classic" line-up reunited for ''[[Santana IV]]'' (2016) and the group continue to perform and record.

Santana is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling groups of all time]] with over 47&nbsp;million certified albums sold the US, and an estimated 100&nbsp;million sold worldwide.<ref name="RIAAsales">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=top_tallies&ttt=TAA#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum – Top Tallies – Top Artists (Albums)|publisher=Recording Industry Association of America|access-date=May 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jacksonville.com/entertainment/music/2017-10-19/echoes-woodstock-santana-one-few-big-names-still-road|title=Echoes of Woodstock: Santana one of the few big names still on the road|work=[[The Florida Times-Union]]|first=Tom|last=Szaroleta|date= October 19, 2017|access-date=October 19, 2017}}</ref> Its [[Santana discography|discography]] include 25 studio albums, 14 of which reached the US top 10.

==History==
===1967–1972: Formation and breakthrough===
The band was formed in San Francisco in 1966 by Mexican-American guitarist Carlos Santana as the Santana Blues Band with the help of guitarist Tom Fraser.<ref>{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=60Jde3l7WNwC&pg=PA137 | title=Legends of rock guitar |first1=Pete |last1=Prown |first2=Harvey P. |last2=Newquist |first3=Jon F. |last3=Eiche |access-date=2015-08-24| isbn=978-0-7935-4042-6 | year=1997 }}</ref> The five-member line-up consisted of Santana on lead guitar, [[Marcus Malone]] on percussion, Rod Harper on drums, Sergio "Gus" Rodriguez on bass, and Gregg Rolie on lead vocals and organ. After their first audition, performing with Family Dog at the [[Avalon Ballroom]] in the late summer of 1967, concert promoter [[Chet Helms]] told the band that they could not achieve success playing Latin-infused rock and suggested Carlos keep his day job as a dishwasher at Tick Tock's Drive-In.

By 1969, the band had secured a record deal with [[Columbia Records]]<ref name="TGG83">{{cite web|url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/carlos-santana-2|title=The Guitar Greats – Carlos Santana|first1=Stuart|last1=Grundy|first2=John|last2=Tobler|publisher=BBC Books|year=1983|via=[[Rock's Backpages]]|url-access=subscription}}</ref> and [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] as manager. Malone had already left the band by this point, as he had been convicted of manslaughter and had started his sentence in [[San Quentin State Prison]]. That May, the band entered Pacific Recording Studios in [[San Mateo, California|San Mateo]], California and recorded their debut album, ''[[Santana (1969 album)|Santana]]''. Composed mostly of instrumental rock tracks, the album contains their first two singles, "[[Jin-go-lo-ba|Jingo]]" and "[[Evil Ways]]". To promote their debut album Graham, who was asked to help organise the upcoming [[Woodstock]] festival, agreed to on the condition that Santana would be added to the bill. Santana performed a 45-minute set in the afternoon of August 16, the second day. The performance launched the group to international fame, and the album, released on August 30, 1969, peaked at No. 4 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. "Evil Ways" went to No. 9 on the ''Billboard'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]].

In April 1970, Santana returned to the studio to record its second album, ''[[Abraxas (album)|Abraxas]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eikEAAAAMBAJ&q=pacific+high+recording+studioas&pg=PA55 |title=Billboard |date=1970-06-27 |access-date=2015-08-24}}</ref> The album, highlighted by a reworking of "[[Black Magic Woman]]" by [[Fleetwood Mac]] that peaked at No. 4 in the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], was released in September 1970 and rose to number 1 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

By 1971, the group were still struggling to maintain a strong musical direction.<ref name="TGG83" /> From January to July they recorded ''[[Santana (1971 album)|Santana III]]''. Released in September 1971, the album also reached number 1 on the US ''Billboard'' 200. At the peak of the band's popularity, the album was the last to feature its classic Woodstock era line-up. Santana explained that there was a lot of unnecessary internal resentment and that managerial problems contributed to the problem, leading to Graham's dismissal.<ref name="TGG83" /> That year, they performed at a concert in [[Accra]] to commemorate [[Ghana]]'s 14th [[Independence Day (Ghana)|Independence Day]]. The concert was filmed and released as ''[[Soul to Soul (film)|Soul to Soul]]'' in theaters.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/08/19/archives/rousing-soul-to-soul.html|title=Rousing 'Soul to Soul'|last=Thompson|first=Howard|date=August 19, 1971|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

In 1972, Santana had been increasingly influenced by the music of [[Miles Davis]], [[John Coltrane]], and [[Joe Zawinul]], who had explored jazz fusion by this time.<ref name="TGG83" /> The fourth album, ''[[Caravanserai (album)|Caravanserai]]'' (1972), marked a number of line-up changes; bassist David Brown left in 1971 before recording started and was replaced by Doug Rauch and Tom Rutley. Carabello was replaced with two percussionists, Armando Peraza and Mingo Lewis. Rolie was replaced by [[Tom Coster]] on a few songs. ''Caravanserai'' debuted at number 8 on the pop charts, despite not spawning a hit single.

===1973–1979: Experimentation and consolidation===
13 months after ''Caravanserai'', Santana released ''[[Welcome (Santana album)|Welcome]]''. ''Welcome'' was the first of four consecutive albums to achieve gold certification, as opposed to the previous four, which all at least reached platinum status. The album peaked at number 25 on the ''Billboard'' 200, the lowest of the band's career so far. The next few albums contained a more experimental style than their previous work, beginning with ''[[Borboletta]]'', which fared arguably worse than its predecessor, despite climbing five spots higher on the Billboard album charts in the US.

The group's 1976 release, ''[[Amigos (Santana album)|Amigos]]'', was far more successful. Reaching number 10 on the US charts, and also hitting the top 10 in France, Australia, New Zealand, Austria and the Netherlands, it was a return to the success of their early albums. ''[[Festival (Santana album)|Festival]]'', did not obtain the same new-found success, but was followed by another successful album, ''[[Moonflower (album)|Moonflower]]'', released in 1977. The album was possibly the most successful since ''Santana III'', achieving 2x platinum in the US, and being the first album since 1974's ''Borboletta'', to break the top 10 in the UK. It was characterized by a stylistic shift for the band, as it contained heavier influences from the more conventional sound of the group's early work, while still maintaining the experimental sound of their last few albums.

Their next two releases, ''[[Inner Secrets]]'' and ''[[Marathon (Santana album)|Marathon]]'', released in 1978 and '79, respectively, were a further musical shift for the band, moving away from the Latin-fused rock music that had characterized their work in the late 1960s and the majority of the '70s, to move towards a more album-oriented, conventional rock sound. These albums, however, fared poorly commercially, although both achieved gold status in the US.

===1980–1997: Commercial decline and seven-year hiatus===
The 1980s started relatively brightly for Santana, with 1981's platinum-selling ''[[Zebop!]]'', which also reached the top 20 in several countries, and continued the more conventional rock sound. The following year, ''[[Shangó (Santana album)|Shangó]]'' was released; this album marked a steep decline in the band's commercial fortunes, although it still achieved gold status.

The group waited another three years to release the follow-up, the longest break for them so far. 1985's ''[[Beyond Appearances]]'' was a commercial failure, and their first album not to achieve gold certification. Their following three releases all continued this commercial decline, with the last of these failing to break the ''Billboard'' top 100. In the midst of this commercial pitfall, the band stopped recording material for an unprecedented seven years but continued to tour.

===1998–2001: ''Supernatural'' and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame===
In 1998, Santana was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. The following year, their album ''[[Supernatural (Santana album)|Supernatural]]'' (1999) debuted at number 19 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and reached No. 1 after eighteen weeks. Also reaching No. 1 were two singles: "[[Smooth (Santana song)|Smooth]]", recorded with [[Rob Thomas (musician)|Rob Thomas]], and "[[Maria Maria]]". The album was certified platinum 15 times by the [[RIAA]] and sold 30&nbsp;million copies worldwide.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Santana's previous number one album had been ''[[Santana (1971 album)|Santana III]]'' in 1971. According to ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', this is the longest gap between number one albums.

''Supernatural'' won nine Grammy Awards, including the award for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], and also won three [[Latin Grammy Awards]], including [[Record of the Year]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===2002–2012: Dealing with new-found success===
[[file:Santana Acer Arena (5558204467).jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Santana performing in 2011]]
The follow-up to ''Supernatural'' came three years later and was highly anticipated by international media and fans alike. On October 22, 2002, ''[[Shaman (album)|Shaman]]'' was released worldwide. Although it initially sold briskly (298,973 copies in the US in its first week) and debuted at number 1 on the ''Billboard'' 200, the album's appeal quickly wore off and it soon slid down the charts. Despite this, it went on to sell 2x platinum in the US, and achieved platinum status in several other countries including Australia. The first single released from the album, "[[The Game of Love (Santana song)|The Game of Love]]", which featured vocals from [[Michelle Branch]], debuted at number 5 on the Hot 100. The album's next four singles failed to chart in most countries, but the final single, "[[Why Don't You & I]]", featuring the vocals of [[Alex Band]], reached number 8 on the Hot 100. Musically, the album was a return to a more conventional sound for the group, with a mainly Latin rock-based sound.

With their renewed appeal worn off, another three-year wait saw the release of 2005's ''[[All That I Am (Santana album)|All That I Am]]''. The album debuted at number 2 on the ''Billboard'' 200 but fared worse internationally, and quickly lost appeal. The album, a continuation of the Latin-rock influenced sound of ''Shaman'', achieved gold certification in the US. A five-year break from recording saw the release of another studio album, ''[[Guitar Heaven]]'' (2010). Musically it was a drastic change for the band, with a far heavier sound at its core and strong [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] influences. It debuted at number 5 on the ''Billboard'' 200 but marked another decline for the band, failing to achieve gold status.

In 2012 the group released ''[[Shape Shifter (album)|Shape Shifter]]'', which returned to the conventional Latin rock sound and was completely album-oriented, as no singles were released from it. It debuted at number 16 on the [[Billboard 200]].

===2013–present: Reunion of the classic line-up, ''Corazón'', ''Santana IV'', and ''Africa Speaks''===
On 2 February 2013, Carlos Santana confirmed that he would reunite his classic line-up, most of whom played Woodstock with him in 1969. Santana stated that he was reuniting the group with the intention of recording new music. Confirmed for the reunion were Neal Schon, who was in the band in the early 1970s where he traded lead guitar work with Santana before leaving with founding Santana singer-organist Gregg Rolie in 1973 to form Journey; drummer Mike Shrieve and percussionist Mike Carabello. Santana said of Rolie, who played with Ringo Starr's All-Starr Band for the last two years, "I'm pretty sure Gregg's going to do it." In February 2013, Rolie told Radio.com, "it's (the reunion) just a matter of putting it together and going and doing it. I would do it. I think it's a great idea. People would love it. It could be great!"<ref>{{cite news|access-date=20 March 2013|url=http://www.presstelegram.com/lifestyle/ci_22679861/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130411172707/http://www.presstelegram.com/lifestyle/ci_22679861/|url-status=dead|archive-date=11 April 2013|title= Santana Reuniting classic 60's and 70's lineup|work=Press Telegram|date=19 February 2013|author=Smith, Steve}}</ref>

In the meantime, Santana released on 6 May 2014 a new studio album entitled ''[[Corazón (Santana album)|Corazón]]'' and on 9 September 2014, ''Corazón – Live from Mexico: Live It to Believe It'', a new live album (on CD, DVD and Blu-ray) of their show on 14 December 2013 in Guadalajara, Mexico.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://santana.hifi247.com/santana-corazon-live-from-mexico-live-it-to-believe-it-dvd.html |title=Santana – Corazon – Live From Mexico: Live It To Believe It DVD |date= 2014 |website=Santana.hifi247.com |access-date=25 October 2014}}</ref>

On 15 April 2016, Santana released ''[[Santana IV]]'', the wildly anticipated studio album that reunited the early 1970s classic lineup of Carlos Santana (guitar, vocals), Gregg Rolie (keyboards, lead vocals), Neal Schon (guitar, vocals), Michael Carabello (percussion) and Michael Shrieve (drums). The album marked the first time in 45 years – since 1971's multi-platinum classic ''[[Santana (1971 album)|Santana III]]'' – that the quintet had recorded together.<ref name="facebook.com carlossantana post 25 January 2016">{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/carlossantana/photos/a.94203671358.88480.9411551358/10153466174096359/?type=1&theater |title=From Team Santana: April 15th, 2016 marks the release date of Santana IV... |date= 25 January 2016 |website=[[Facebook]] |access-date= 10 February 2016}}</ref>

The origins for the reunion go back several years, when Schon suggested that he and Carlos Santana record together. Santana liked the idea but went one better, proposing that they recruit Rolie, Shrieve and Carabello for what would be called "Santana IV". After initial writing sessions and rehearsals took place in 2013, the group recorded throughout 2014 and 2015, amassing 16 new tracks that combined all their signature elements – Afro-Latin rhythms, soaring vocals, electrifying blues-psychedelic guitar solos, and irrepressible jubilant percussion work.

About the "Santana IV" team, Santana stated: "It was magical, we didn't have to try to force the vibe – it was immense. From there, we then needed to come up with a balance of songs and jams that people would immediately identify as Santana."<ref name="santana.hifi247.com Santana IV">{{cite web |url=http://santana.hifi247.com/santana-iv-cd.html |title=Santana IV CD |date= 2016 |website=santana.com |access-date= 10 February 2016}}</ref>

''Santana IV'' features 16 all-new tracks written and produced by the band. Joining the core "Santana IV" band in the studio are current Santana members Karl Perazzo (percussion) and Benny Rietveld (bass), with vocalist [[Ronald Isley]] guesting on two cuts.

The first single from ''Santana IV'', entitled "Anywhere You Want to Go", was released on 5 February 2016.<ref name="news.iheart.com Anywhere You Want To Go">{{cite web |url=http://news.iheart.com/articles/rock-news-104703/listen-to-santana-anywhere-you-want-14327897/ |title=Listen to Santana – 'Anywhere You Want To Go' |date= 1 February 2016 |website=news.iheart.com |access-date= 10 February 2016}}</ref>

On 21 October 2016, Santana released ''Santana IV: Live at the House of Blues Las Vegas'' on Eagle Rock Entertainment, a new (151 minutes) live album (on DVD/Blu-ray/2CD) of their concert on 21 March 2016 at [[House of Blues]] in [[Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] in [[Nevada]].

In early January 2019, Santana signed with [[Concord Records]]<ref name="concord.com Carlos Santana signs with Concord Records">{{cite web |url=https://concord.com/concord-music-news/legendary-musician-carlos-santana-signs-with-concord-records |title=Legendary Musician Carlos Santana Signs with Concord Records |date= April 2019 |website=[[Concord Music]] |access-date= 9 April 2019}}</ref> and on 25 January, they released ''[[In Search of Mona Lisa]]'', a new (5-track) EP.<ref name="AllMusic">{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/in-search-of-mona-lisa-mw0003237271 |title=Santana – ''In Search of Mona Lisa'': Review |first=Stephen |last=Erlewine |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=9 April 2019}}</ref> The day before, they also released a video for new single, "Do You Remember Me."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/news/santana-premiere-do-you-remember-me-music-video|title=Santana Premiere "Do You Remember Me" Music Video|last=News|first=Jackson Maxwell 2019-01-24T21:52:26Z|website=guitarworld|language=en|access-date=2019-01-25}}</ref> In March 2019, the band announced plans to release on June 7, 2019, ''[[Africa Speaks (Santana album)|Africa Speaks]]'', their new full-length album produced by [[Rick Rubin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/santana-rick-rubin-song-los-invisibles-809641/|title=Hear Santana's Fiery New Rick Rubin-Produced Song 'Los Invisibles'|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=2019-03-18|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-09}}</ref>
