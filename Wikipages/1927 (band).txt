'''1927''' are an Australian [[pop rock]] band formed in 1987 with James Barton on drums, Bill Frost on bass guitar, his brother Garry Frost on guitar and keyboards, and Eric Weideman on vocals, guitar and keyboards. They were popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s with their major hit songs "[[That's When I Think of You]]", "[[If I Could (1927 song)|If I Could]]", "[[Compulsory Hero]]" and "[[Tell Me a Story (1927 song)|Tell Me a Story]]". Their multi-platinum number-one album, ''[[...Ish (album)|...ish]]'' (1988) was followed by ''[[The Other Side (1927 album)|The Other Side]]'' (1990). At the [[ARIA Music Awards of 1989]] they won two categories: Breakthrough Artist – Album for ''...ish'' and Breakthrough Artist – Single for "[[That's When I Think of You]]". At the [[ARIA Music Awards of 1990|1990 ceremony]] they won Best Video for "[[Compulsory Hero]]", which was directed by Geoff Barter. In 1992 the group released a third studio album, ''[[1927 (album)|1927]]'', which reached the top&nbsp;40; but they disbanded the following year. Weideman reformed 1927 in 2009 with a new line-up.

==History==
===1984–1987: Formation===
In 1984 guitarist and keyboardist Garry Frost had left Sydney-based pop rockers, [[Moving Pictures (band)|Moving Pictures]], after their second album, ''Matinée''. Frost had co-written Moving Pictures' 1981 number-one hit "[[What About Me (Moving Pictures song)|What About Me?]]".<ref name="Kruger"/><ref name="AusChartsWhat"/> In late 1986 Frost was writing songs at his home studio for an unformed band project.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="AMGBio"/> In 1987, he was watching [[Nine Network]]'s variety series ''[[Hey Hey It's Saturday]]''{{'}}s talent segment "Red Faces" when Eric Weideman appeared and performed a cover of [[The Police]]'s hit single, "[[Roxanne (The Police song)|Roxanne]]".<ref name="AMGBio"/><ref name="Mengel"/> Garry drove from Sydney to Melbourne, about {{convert|880|km|abbr=on}}, to recruit Weideman on lead vocals, guitar, and keyboards.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="AMGBio"/> Prior to joining 1927 Weideman had played in various cover bands including, Mixed Feelings, before starting a brief solo career.<ref name="Mengel"/><ref name="Hamey"/> He later recalled, "I had only just started performing on my own. I was playing at a pub in Melbourne ... Then a friend of mine dared me to go on 'Red Faces'".<ref name="Mengel"/> The pair were joined by Garry's brother Bill Frost on bass guitar and James Barton on drums and the band ''1927'' were officially formed. The band's name, 1927, was drawn from a hat of suggestions and was from a favourite saying by Garry, "I haven't done that since 1927".<ref name="Braithwaite"/>
