{{rquote|left|''When I started out, I was a contemporary vocalist however the late'' [[Thomas Whitfield (singer)|Thomas Whitfield]] ''mixed it up with a traditional feel and since then I never went far from that... I love the contemporary and I love the traditional... to me the time-honored sounds of Gospel music is our medicine... it gives us hope... it encourages, but the contemporary-up tempo stuff is what lifts us up. It all works together.''|Vanessa Bell Armstrong{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} }}

Armstrong made her solo debut on Onyx/Muscle Shoals Sound Records in 1983 with the album ''Peace Be Still''. The title track has since become one of Armstrong's signature songs.
Armstrong's second album ''Chosen'' hit number one on the US Billboard [[Top Gospel Albums]] chart.<ref name="80scount">{{cite web|url=http://www.prayzehymnonline.com/articles_80scountdown.html|title=80's Countdown|publisher=PraiseHymnOnline.com|author=J.

She is also a seven time [[Grammy Award]]-nominee.

Armstrong enjoyed a slice of mainstream success in the late 1980s.  [[Vanessa Bell Armstrong (album)|Her self-titled 1987 Jive Records debut]] yielded the Billboard-charting hit "You Bring Out The Best in Me," as well as the club favorite "Pressing On."<ref name="80scount"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1546/is_n6_v10/ai_18093551/pg_1|title=Hip deep in gospel – American African music form continues to change|publisher=American Visions|year=1995|author=Hardy, James Earl}}</ref> The next year's follow-up album ''Wonderful One'' featured a cover of the [[Labi Siffre]] anti-[[Apartheid]] anthem "Something Inside So Strong." The song was later remade in 1995 by Armstrong along with [[Shirley Caesar]], [[Fred Hammond]], [[Tramaine Hawkins]], [[Yolanda Adams]], and a host of other gospel artists as a tribute to [[Rosa Parks]]. The song was serviced to radio stations to play on the 40th anniversary of the civil rights icon's arrest.

Armstrong appeared on Broadway in 1991 in a production of ''Don't Get God Started''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?res=9B0DE0DE123DF932A05753C1A961948260|title=The Stage: 'Don't Get God Started,' a Gospel Musical|newspaper=The New York Times|author=Holden, Stephen|date=October 31, 1987}}</ref> "Always," a [[Winans family#Marvin Winans|Marvin Winans]] composition that anchors the play, also appears on Armstrong's 1987 self-titled album. Her Broadway role lead to a cameo appearance in the [[Oprah Winfrey]] TV special ''[[The Women of Brewster Place (1989 television)|The Women of Brewster Place]]''. Armstrong was also chosen to record the theme to the popular 1980s NBC sitcom ''[[Amen (TV series)|Amen]]''.

Armstrong took a three-year self-imposed hiatus from recording before releasing ''A Brand New Day'' under a new deal with Tommy Boy Gospel in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gospelcity.com/dynamic/music-articles/reviews/138|date=December 28, 2001|publisher=GospelCity.com|title=Vanessa Bell Armstrong – A Brand New Day|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050914034901/http://www.gospelcity.com/dynamic/music-articles/reviews/138|archive-date=September 14, 2005}}</ref> She was presented with a lifetime achievement award during 2004's Gospel Superfest.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20040123/ai_n9618881|title=What are you looking at?|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|date=January 23, 2004|author=Rosenthal, Phil}}</ref>

Armstrong's 2007 album, ''Walking Miracle'', is her first release in 6 years, and blends traditional gospel fare like "So Good To Me" (produced by [[Smokie Norful]]) with contemporary songs like "Til The Victory's Won" (produced by [[Fred Jerkins III]]) and the title track (produced by [[Rodney Jerkins]]). The latter song was inspired by Armstrong's son who was recently diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.<ref name="emi">{{cite web|url=http://www.emigospel.com/artist/artist_news_story.aspx?aid=440631&iid=502701&tid=227|title=Vanessa Bell Armstrong EMI Gospel Press Release|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008213328/http://www.emigospel.com/artist/artist_news_story.aspx?aid=440631&iid=502701&tid=227|archive-date=October 8, 2007}}</ref>
