'''Antony Von Williams''', known professionally as '''the World Famous Tony Williams''', is an American singer and songwriter from [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]]. Williams is perhaps best known for his vocals on his first cousin [[Kanye West]]'s debut album, ''[[The College Dropout]]'' (2004) as well as his subsequent albums.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://skopemag.com/2009/01/26/stoli-chills-with-good-music-artist-tony-williams#more-7213 |title=STOLI CHILLS WITH G.O.O.D MUSIC ARTIST TONY WILLIAMS / MP3 / VIDEO |author= |date=January 26, 2009 |website=Skopemag.com|accessdate=October 13, 2010}}</ref> He is currently managed by [[David Bullock]].<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=http://greenlabel.com/sabrina-vaz-holder-took-our-fave-pic-of-chance-digging-through-the-greats/|title=SABRINA VAZ-HOLDER TOOK OUR FAVE PIC OF CHANCE: DIGGING THROUGH THE GREATS|date=April 3, 2017|work=[[Green Label]]|accessdate=April 3, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/TWFTonyWilliams|title=Tony Williams (@TWFTonyWilliams) {{!}} Twitter|website=twitter.com|language=en|access-date=March 20, 2020}}</ref><!-- Wayback machine won't archive twitter profiles, so uploaded a screenshot. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_World_Famous_Tony_Williams_Twitter_bio_2020-03-20.png -->

==Early life==
Williams grew up an only child in [[Oklahoma City]], Oklahoma. Both his mother and father had musical backgrounds, and Williams was given his first instrument, a saxophone, at the age of eight. He grew up singing in youth choirs at church and played in the [[marching band]] through his tenth grade year of high school. Williams love for music continued throughout his early adulthood as he went on to form several bands that ranged in style from [[funk]], rock, [[Alternative rock|alternative]], and [[Christian alternative rock|Christian alternative]], and took on the role as lead vocalist.

==Musical career==
===Songwriter===
Williams' name appears on Kanye West's albums as Tony "Penafire" Williams which is the pseudonym he uses when crediting himself as a writer. He was a co-writer of two songs on ''[[The College Dropout]]'', the [[Grammy Award]] winning 2004 album, following which Williams was invited to write for all of West's subsequent albums.

On the 2005 [[MTV]] documentary, ''Composing History'' ''The Making of [[Late Registration]]'', he was featured producing vocals for [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]] on the song "Bring Me Down", which he co-wrote. During that documentary, West described Williams as being "a great writer with a cutting edge voice."{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Singer===
[[File:Kanye West Coachella 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Kanye West]] performing at [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]] festival while backed by Tony Williams, 2006]]
Tony Williams first became noticed as a singer when he debuted on Kanye West's Grammy winning album ''[[The College Dropout]]'', singing a version of the gospel hymn "[[I'll Fly Away]]". By the second album, ''[[Late Registration]]'', Kanye was giving Williams shout outs on the song, "We Major" which gave rise to the line Kanye fans use in reference to Williams, "I gotta say what's up to Tony Williams". On that same album Tony wrote the hook for the song, "Roses", which featured him singing with [[Patti LaBelle]]. This album not only promoted Tony Williams name, but for the first time fans were able to match his voice and name with a face. He was featured on the song and the video for "[[Drive Slow]]".  Later, he was seen singing with Kanye when West was featured on the MTV television series, ''Life and Rhymes of Kanye West''.

By the time Kanye went on the ''Touch the Sky'' Tour, Williams was known as the background singer that always accompanied West, including on several world tours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1511361/20051012/west_kanye.jhtml |title=Kanye West Made Sure To Touch The Sky At Tour Launch |author=Shaheem Reid |date= |work=[[MTV News]] |publisher=[[MTV Network]] |accessdate=October 13, 2010}}</ref>

Williams is one of a few performers who have performed at two different Inaugural Balls;{{clarify|date=February 2013}} the Neighborhood Ball where he performed with [[Jay-Z]] on the song, ''History'', and the Youth Ball where he performed with [[Kanye West]]. His voice is recognized on some popular Hip Hop songs, having performed with, for example, [[Jay-Z]], [[Kanye West]], [[Nas]], [[Game (rapper)|Game]], and [[Rick Ross (rapper)|Rick Ross]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.djbooth.net/index/tracks/review/rick-ross-live-fast-die/ |title=Rick Ross – Live Fast Die Young |author= |date= |publisher=djbooth.net |accessdate=October 13, 2010}}</ref>

In March 2010, Williams released his first mainstream project in the form of a mixtape, ''The World Famous Tony Williams: [[Finding Dakota Grey]]'' which was released with the [[GOOD Music]] stamp.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soulculture.co.uk/blogs/music-blog/newmusic/free-downloads/free-download-the-world-famous-tony-williams-finding-dakota-grey-g-o-o-d-music/ |title=FREE Download: The World Famous Tony Williams: Finding Dakota Grey (G.O.O.D Music) |author=M. Gosho Oakes |date=March 12, 2010 |publisher=Soul Culture Media |accessdate=October 13, 2010}}</ref> This project was a collection of original music, covers, and remixes, including the "Dreaming of your love remix" with the French rapper Matt Moerdock.

In October 2010, Williams released his first single "Everything About You" from his debut studio album, ''King or the Fool'', which was released on February 14, 2012.

===Featured artist===
The first time Williams experienced artistic autonomy was in 2007 when he made an appearance on Kanye's ''[[Can't Tell Me Nothing (mixtape)|Can't Tell Me Nothing]]'' mixtape, singing a song he had written and that was produced by Kanye, "Dreaming of Your Love". This legitimized him as a featured artist. It was at that time that Williams added "The World Famous" to his name to differentiate himself from the [[Tony Williams (drummer)|famous drummer with the same name]], and because in the vocal sample of the song "Dreaming of Your Love" the intro says, "You're listening to the world famous". Williams has had songs played on Brazilian airwaves, where he sang some of the vocals in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and some musical chart success in France.
