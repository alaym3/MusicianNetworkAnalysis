Their sold-out "Ban All the Music" tour of the UK began on 19 October 2015. A second British tour in April 2016, called the "Under My Skin" tour, was announced on 9 November 2015. The band had to postpone some dates on their "Under My Skin" tour as they were asked to support Muse on their "Drones" tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/muse/91912|title=Muse announce Nothing but Thieves as support act for 'Drones' tour {{!}} NME.COM|last=NME.COM|website=NME.COM|language=en-GB|access-date=13 June 2016}}</ref> They tweeted their elation on Twitter, branding the experience "pretty awesome".

=== 2016–2020: ''Broken Machine'' and ''What Did You Think When You Made Me This Way?'' ===
{{Main articles|Broken Machine (album)|What Did You Think When You Made Me This Way?}}
A small tour of UK clubs took place in late May 2017, to support "Amsterdam," the first single from their second album ''[[Broken Machine (album)|Broken Machine]]'', released on 8 September 2017. Later on 14 August, the second single, "[[Sorry (Nothing But Thieves song)|Sorry]]", became their first single to chart on the [[UK Singles Chart]], reaching No.89.<ref>{{Cite web|title=NOTHING BUT THIEVES {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/47614/nothing-but-thieves/|access-date=2021-02-20|website=www.officialcharts.com}}</ref> On 5 August 2017 they played to a crowd of over 500,000 people at [[Woodstock Festival (Poland)|Woodstock Festival Poland]]. On 23 August 2017 they supported Muse and [[Biffy Clyro]] at [[Belfast Vital|Vital Festival]] in [[Belfast]] ahead of their sold out "Broken Machine" tour. The band also sold out two consecutive nights at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]] in London.

Sarah Taylor said on Varsity "In general, this album pushes more boundaries than the last one. The band carved a name for themselves with their debut, but here it feels like they’re trying to define themselves to a further extent; there’s more variety in the music and lyricism, and more politics, too. Joe Langridge-Brown, guitarist and lyricist alongside Mason, said that “all the songs on the album are things that we’ve gone through or spoken about: Trump, religion, bigotry...” and ‘Live Like Animals’ is an anthem for the disillusioned youth. It features lyrics such as “We put our lives all up for sale / We get our truth in the daily mail” and “We’re gonna make ’em build a wall / We’re gonna live like animals”. Other tracks, such as ‘Broken Machine’ itself, and the deluxe version's ‘Number 13’ are more experimental rhythmically: they're the type of songs you have to listen to a few times before you decide whether you like them or not. I did, and I do.".
