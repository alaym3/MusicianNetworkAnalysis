'''Inspector''' is both a [[police]] rank and an administrative position, both used in a [[number]] of contexts. However, it is not an [[Logical equivalence|equivalent]] rank in each [[police]] force.

== Australia ==
In Australian [[police forces]], the rank of Inspector is generally the next senior rank from [[Sergeant|senior sergeant]] and is less senior than a [[Superintendent (police)|superintendent]] (in the cases of the [[Queensland Police]] and [[Western Australia Police]]) in the other [[Australian Federal Police|Australian police force]]s. Members holding the rank usually wear an epaulette featuring three silver pips, the same rank badge as a [[Captain (land and air)|captain]] in the [[Australian Army|army]].
In addition to the general rank of inspector, some [[police]] forces use other ranks such as detective inspector and district inspector.

== Austria ==
In Austria a similar scheme was used as in Germany. At some point the police inspector was completely removed from the list of service ranks. The current police service has an inspectors service track with ''Inspektor'' being the entry level – it is followed by ''Revierinspektor'' (precinct inspector), ''Gruppeninspektor'' (group inspector), ''Bezirksinspektor'' (district  inspector), ''Abteilungsinspektor'' (section inspector), ''Kontrollinspektor'' (control inspector) and ''Chefinspektor'' (chief inspector).

== Canada ==
In most [[Policing in Canada|Canadian police services]] the rank of inspector is the first officer/commissioned officer rank, above that of [[staff sergeant]]. It is usually immediately below the rank of [[superintendent (police)|superintendent]]. Depending on the police force, an inspector may be considered senior management. The rank insignia of an inspector in Canada is usually a crown on the epaulettes, the insignia of a major in the army. In some police services such as the [[Royal Newfoundland Constabulary]] or the [[Vancouver Police Department]], the rank insignia are three pips, similar to the insignia of an army captain, while in others including the [[Toronto Police Service]] and [[Peel Regional Police]], the insignia consists of two maple leaves, similar to an army lieutenant's insignia.

Provincial police services and the majority of municipal police services, such as the [[Toronto Police Service]] have a staff inspector rank, which ranks above inspector and below superintendent.<ref>{{cite web|author=Toronto Police Service |url=http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/rank/ |title=Toronto Police Service :: To Serve and Protect |publisher=Torontopolice.on.ca |access-date=2017-05-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://vancouver.ca/police/recruiting/police-officers/policing.html#Advancement |title=The Job &#124; Vancouver Police Department |publisher=Vancouver.ca |access-date=2017-05-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edmontonpolice.ca//~/media/EPS%20External/Files/Reports/2008AnnualReport.ashx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-06-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611015615/http://www.edmontonpolice.ca/~/media/EPS%20External/Files/Reports/2008AnnualReport.ashx |archive-date=2010-06-11 }}</ref> Other Commonwealth police agencies and some American police departments, such as the [[Philadelphia Police Department]], also have staff inspectors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phila.gov/personnel/specs/6A08.htm|title=ranks|publisher=phila.gov|access-date=13 January 2018}}</ref>

== France ==
In the [[French National Police]], ''inspecteur'' is a former rank of members of the Command and Management Corps. There were several grades of ''inspecteur'', with senior detectives holding the various grades of ''[[Commissaire de police|commissaire]]''. See [[French National Police]] for current ranks. In the [[Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes|French customs]], ''inspecteur'' is the first rank of members of the Command and Management Corps.

== Germany ==
Currently, in Germany, ''Inspektor'' is a civil service rank. It is the lowest and therefore the entry rank of the ''gehobener Dienst'' (upper service) requiring a degree from a three-year administrative college. The rank is not used in the German police services; there the equivalent of inspector is ''Kommissar''. In earlier times the upper service track was called ''Inspektorenlaufbahn'' (inspectors service track) ranging from ''Inspektor'', ''Oberinspektor'' (senior inspector), ''[[Amtmann]]'', ''Amtsrat'' to ''Oberamtsrat'' (senior supervisor).

The title is used on many professional areas that require an inspection service, like ''Brandinspektor'' (fire inspector in the fire department), ''Steuerinspektor'' (tax inspector in the financial department) and ''Bauinspektor'' (building inspector in building control) that are in a supervision position of their department. In many administrations, a corresponding position exists like ''Regierungsinspektor'' (government inspector on the federal level), ''Stadtinspektor''/''Stadtverwaltungsinspektor'' (city administration inspector), ''Kreisinspektor''/''Kreisverwaltungsinspektor'' (county administration inspector) that serve in supervision of the department.

In some regions ''Inspektor'' is a colloquial name for any police officer, just like in Austria.

== Hong Kong ==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:S-GOVT-HKPF-INS-CIP.gif|thumb|Chief inspector insignia of [[Hong Kong Police Force]]]] -->
In the [[Hong Kong Police Force]], inspector (including probationary inspector, senior inspector and Sub-Inspector) is the rank senior to [[station sergeant]] but junior to [[chief inspector]], leading a sub-unit in day-to-day policing. The rank badge for probationary inspector is one silver pip on his or her epaulette; two silver pips for inspector of police; and two silver pips and one bar for senior inspector of police. The epaulettes rank badge for chief inspector is three silver pips. The epaulettes of all inspectors do not show their personal identification number. Plainclothes detective inspectors have the prefix "detective" identifying them as having been trained in criminal investigation and being part of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) or Organised Crime Triad Bureau (OCTB).

Several of the HKP's past and current commissioner of chiefs joined the force in the probationary inspector ranks as opposed to the junior ranks.

The [[Customs and Excise Department (Hong Kong)|Customs and Excise Department]] also has an inspector rank but with bronze stars and bars rank badges instead.

In addition, there are health inspectors from the [[Food and Environmental Hygiene Department]] who carry out investigations and prosecutions on sanitary nuisances and food business irregularities under relevant ordinances. They are characterised by golden stars and yellow rank badges.

== India ==
{{Main|List of police ranks in India}}
[[File:Police_Inspector_insignia.png|thumb|90px|Insignia of an officer of the Indian Police holding the rank of inspector]]

Inspectors of police in India are typically the officers in charge at a police station. In a police station in India, there are constables, the head constable, an assistant sub-inspector, a sub-inspector and an inspector. They have the three-star insignia to indicate their position and are high command officers. The inspector rank is higher than the sub-inspector rank and lower than the deputy superintendent (DSP) rank. Inspectors, along with sub-inspectors and assistant sub-inspectors, comprise around 13% of the total police personnel in India.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://prsindia.org/files/policy/policy_analytical_reports/Police%20Reforms%20in%20India.pdf |title=Police Reforms in India |date= June 2017 |website=prsindia.org |publisher=PRS Legislative Research |access-date= 23 October 2021}}</ref>

== Indonesia ==
In the [[Indonesian National Police]], there are four levels of inspector, which are ''Inspektur Polisi Satu'' (first police inspector), ''Inspektur Polisi Dua'' (senior police inspector), ''Ajun Inspektur Polisi Satu'' (first police inspector [[adjutant]]), and ''Ajun Inspektur Polisi Dua'' (second police inspector adjutant). Those ranks are below the rank of ''Ajun Komisaris Polisi'' (police commissioner adjutant) and above the rank of ''Brigadir Polisi Kepala'' (chief police brigadier).

== Republic of Ireland ==
In the ''[[Garda Síochána]]'', inspectors are senior to sergeants and junior to [[Superintendent (police)|superintendents]]. Inspectors may be either detectives or in uniform.

== Italy ==
In the ''[[Polizia di Stato]]'', the position of ''Ispettore'' (inspector) replaced the rank of ''[[Marshal (Italy)|Maresciallo]]'' (marshal) after the 1981 reorganization and [[demilitarization]] of the corps; an ''Ispettore'' is thus a [[sergeant]] of several sorts, above the rank of ''Sovrintendente'' ([[Superintendent (police)|superintendent]], which is somewhat equal to a [[Corporal|senior corporal]]) and under the rank of ''[[Police commissioner|Commissario]]'' (commissioner). There are three four different Inspector ranks in the ''Polizia di Stato'': ''Vice Ispettore'' (assistant inspector), ''Ispettore'' (inspector), ''Ispettore Capo'' ([[chief inspector]]) and ''Ispettore Superiore'' (special inspector, or superior inspector), roughly equivalent to the ranks ranging from [[junior sergeant]] to [[second lieutenant]]. A fifth position, called ''Ispettore Superiore S.U.P.S.'', where the acronym stands for ''Sostituto Ufficiale di Pubblica Sicurezza'' (special inspector – substitute public safety commissioned officer), is used to designate those inspectors which can act as substitutes for [[Police commissioner|commissioners]] in the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] under certain situations, or in police detachments that are too small to require the presence of a commissioner; when this happens, the officer is named ''Ispettore Superiore – Sostituto Commissario'' (special inspector – substitute commissioner). Inspectors can serve either in uniformed patrol duties, plainclothed patrol duties, or as detectives. The inspector ranks are the highest that an Italian police officer can reach without having a university degree.

== Malaysia ==
In the [[Royal Malaysia Police]], the rank of inspector is one level above sub-inspector and one level below assistant superintendent. There are two stages: probation inspector (probation lasts within three years) and inspector. Inspectors are recruited differently from normal police constables, requiring at least a degree, and their training is longer.

== Montenegro ==

In the [[Law enforcement in Montenegro|Police of Montenegro]], the title of police inspector (''policijski inspektor'') is reserved for college or police academy educated staff, with six ranks based on seniority (junior police inspector, police inspector, police inspector I class, independent police inspector, senior police inspector, senior police inspector I class and chief police inspector). Although supervisory staff in uniformed police units also hold various police inspector ranks, in common parlance, the title of ''inspector'' is usually used referring to police officers working in plainclothes in criminal investigation units, equivalent to ''detective'' in some countries.

There are also numerous civilian ''inspector'' titles, fitting various inspection and supervision roles within governmental structure of Montenegro (health inspector, tax inspector, tourism inspector, etc.)

== Nepal ==
In [[Nepal Police]], the rank of Inspector is generally the next senior rank from Sub Inspector (SI) and is less senior than a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP). Members holding the rank usually wear an epaulette featuring one pair of crossed [[kukri]], the same rank badge as an Inspector in [[Armed Police Force (Nepal)]].

== Papua New Guinea ==
In the [[Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary]], the rank of Inspector is one level above [[Chief Sergeant]] and below [[Senior Inspector]]. Officer Cadets normally graduate and automatically become an Inspector.

==Philippines==
In the [[Philippines]], inspector is a rank in the [[Bureau of Jail Management and Penology]] and the [[Bureau of Fire Protection]].  It is above the senior officer 4 (sergeant) and below the senior inspector (captain).  It is regarded as an equivalent of a lieutenant in the Army.

== Poland ==
In [[Poland]], inspector (''inspektor'') is a high rank (above ''podinspektor'' and ''młodszy inspektor'', but below ''nadinspektor''), comparable to [[colonel]] of the armed forces.

== Romania ==
In the [[Romanian Police]], inspector is a rank senior to ''[[Sub-inspector#Romania|Subinspector]]'' and junior to ''[[Chief Inspector|Inspector principal]]'' and corresponds to the former rank of Police [[Lieutenant]] (''see [[Romanian Police#Ranks|Romanian Police Ranks]]'').

== Singapore ==
In the [[Singapore Police Force]], there are several ranks that have the title of Inspector in it.

In the junior police officer category, there is the rank of 'Station Inspector', 'Senior Station Inspector' and 'Senior Station Inspector (2)'. The title of 'Inspector' is in the senior police officer category. For National Servicemen, outstanding policemen may be appointed as a 'National Service Probationary Inspector'.

In the [[National Police Cadet Corps]], the rank of Probationary Inspector is given to officer cadet trainees who have successfully completed their Officers' Basic Training Course or Honorary Officers' Basic Training Course. Probationary Inspectors who pass their probationary period will then attain the rank of Inspector. The rank insignia of Probationary Inspector and Inspector is two pips, with the letters 'NPCC' below it, so as to differentiate NPCC Inspectors from Singapore Police Force personnel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npcc.org.sg/roa.html|title=National Police Cadet Corps|website=www.npcc.org.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-11-21}}</ref>

== Spain ==
In [[Spain]], the rank of Inspector exists in the National Police Force<ref>Official Web of Spanish National Police Force [http://www.policia.es/cnp/cnp.html Policia.es], Cuerpo Nacional de Policía.</ref> of Spain ([[:es:Inspector de policía (España)|''Cuerpo Nacional de Policía'']]), the [[Mossos d'Esquadra|Catalan Police Force]], and several municipal police forces.

== Sri Lanka ==
In the [[Sri Lanka Police]], Inspector of Police (IP) is senior to ''[[Sub-inspector#Sri Lanka|Sub-Inspector]]'' and junior to ''[[Chief Inspector]]''. In many towns, Inspectors would be the [[Officer in charge (police)|Officer in Charge]] (OIC) at most [[police station]]s. The rank insignia for a Police Inspector is two stars. All those officers are deemed to be Gazzated officers and Staff Grade officers of Public Service.

In addition to the Police, the term Inspector is used in other government departments for posts such as ''Chief Inspector of Excise'', ''Inspector of Excise'', ''Chief Inspector of Customs'', ''Inspector of Customs'', ''Co-operative Inspector'', ''Fisheries Inspector'', [[Public Health Inspector (Sri Lanka)|Public Health Inspector]].

== United Kingdom ==
[[File:Inspector Epaulette.svg|UK police inspector epaulette|thumb|100px|right]]
{{See also|Police ranks of the United Kingdom}}
Within the [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|British police]], inspector is the second supervisory [[Police ranks of the United Kingdom|rank]]. It is senior to that of [[Sergeant#United Kingdom|sergeant]], and junior to that of [[Chief Inspector#United Kingdom|chief inspector]]. The rank is mostly operational, meaning that inspectors are directly concerned with day-to-day policing. Uniformed inspectors are often responsible for supervising a duty shift made up of constables and sergeants, or act in specialist roles such as supervising [[Road Policing Unit|road traffic policing]].

The rank of inspector has existed since the foundation of the [[Metropolitan Police]], [[Metropolitan Police Act 1829|formed in 1829]], when it was used to designate the rank immediately below that of [[Superintendent (police)|superintendent]], and many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] police forces also use the term.

Plainclothes detective inspectors are equal in rank to their uniformed counterparts, the prefix "detective" identifying them as having been trained in criminal investigation and being part of or attached to their force's [[Criminal Investigation Department]] (CID).

The [[epaulette]]s of uniformed inspectors, unlike those of constables and sergeants, do not show a [[Police division|divisional]] or [[Collar number|personal identification number]]. Instead they feature [[Order of the Bath]] stars, informally known as "pips", being the same insignia as those of a [[lieutenant]] in the [[British Army]].

Newly promoted inspectors currently receive a salary of £52,698 (£55,005 London) (2020 payscale) rising to £57,162 (£59,490 London).<ref>[https://www.polfed.org/resources/pay-and-morale/pay-scales/inspector-pay-scales/]</ref>

In the Metropolitan Police, the rank was formerly officially known as Station Inspector to distinguish it from the more senior rank of [[Sub-Divisional Inspector]] (abolished in 1949). A Station Inspector wore a single star on his epaulettes until 1936, when this changed to a star over two bars to accommodate the new rank of [[Junior Station Inspector#Metropolitan Police|Junior Station Inspector]] (wearing a star over one bar).<ref>"New Police Badges", ''The Times'', 27 June 1936</ref>

== United States ==
<!-- This section is linked from [[Captain]] -->
In the United States, the term inspector can have very different meanings depending on the law enforcement agency.

=== Municipal police ===
{{See also|Police ranks of the United States}}

An inspector in a US municipal police department is more likely to be a senior-executive officer, analogous to a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] police [[Superintendent (police)|superintendent]] or [[chief superintendent]]. It may also be a title held by a supervisor of detectives.

In the [[New York City Police Department]], a [[deputy inspector]] is one grade above captain, wearing the insignia of a military major, and an inspector is another grade higher, wearing the insignia of a military colonel. In the [[Philadelphia Police Department]], a [[staff inspector]] is a grade above captain and an inspector is another grade higher, with the insignia of a lieutenant colonel. An inspector is also two grades above a captain in the [[Baltimore Police Department]], [[Nassau County Police Department]] and [[Suffolk County Police Department]].

Inspector is more rarely used as a rank that is one grade above [[Police captain|captain]], such as in the [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia]]. This is equivalent to a major or [[Commander#American police rank|commander]] in other departments. The [[Los Angeles Police Department]] formerly had a rank of inspector for this purpose. It was changed to commander in 1974.

In the police departments of [[Hayward, California|Hayward]], [[California]], [[Oklahoma City]] and formerly in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]], inspector was the rank held by a senior detective.

In the [[San Francisco Police Department]], inspector is the normal title for a detective. Unlike detectives in most other departments, inspectors in San Francisco always have supervisory duties. This is one of the few modern remaining cases of inspector being used as the title for detectives, as many other police or sheriff's departments using the title of inspector in that context have, since, gotten rid of that title. A few other police or sheriff's departments, such as the [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island]] police department, also use the title in that capacity.

Inspectors are sometimes used as the title for internal affairs investigators within a police or sheriff's department, including in Florida's [[Alachua County Sheriff's Office]].

=== State police ===
In the [[Wisconsin State Patrol]], and others, inspectors are state troopers assigned to the motor carrier safety inspection unit where they enforce trucking laws and regulations. The [[Michigan State Police]] recognizes inspector as a formal rank. Unlike municipal or county police/sheriffs' inspectors, Michigan State Police inspectors are a grade below captain, instead of at least one grade above.

The North Carolina Department of Transportation's Division of Motor Vehicles License and Theft Bureau uses the title of inspector for its sworn state law enforcement agents/investigators. The inspectors of this agency investigate motor vehicle theft, title and odometer frauds, state issued identification and driver's license frauds, as well as regulate and inspect motor vehicle dealerships, repair shops, tow and storage facilities, and emissions and safety inspection centers. The NC DMV License and Theft Bureau is the state's oldest law enforcement agency and was formed in 1921 to combat vehicle theft with the rising sales of Ford's Model T. The agency has kept the title designation of inspector for traditional purposes.<ref>[http://www.ncdot.org/dmv/other_services/licensetheft/about.html Ncdot.org]</ref>

The [[Oregon Liquor Control Commission]] uses the title of inspector for sworn law enforcement agents who investigate violations of the Liquor Control Act and other related crimes.

=== Federal agencies ===
In the [[Federal Bureau of Investigations]] (FBI), an inspector is a [[special agent]] whose main duty is inspecting local field offices and resident agencies to make sure they are operating efficiently. Since FBI inspectors are not tied to any particular field office, they have, in the past, also been used as trouble-shooting investigators on major cases. [[Joseph Sullivan (FBI)|Joseph Sullivan]] was perhaps the best-known of the Bureau's Major Case Inspectors and served as the model for Inspector Lew Erskine, the fictional character played by [[Efrem Zimbalist Jr.]] in the 1965–1974 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] TV series ''[[The F.B.I. (TV series)|The FBI]]''.  [[Samuel P. Cowley]] was an FBI inspector in the late 1920s and 1930s who assisted in bringing down notorious gangsters such as [[John Dillinger]] in the early 1930s, before his death in November 1934 in a gun battle with [[Baby Face Nelson]].

The [[United States Marshals Service]] and the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] employ similar positions, but they primarily serve as internal affairs investigators.
The [[United States Park Police]] changed the rank of Inspector to the rank of Major, which is between captain and deputy chief.
In the [[Postal Inspection Service]], inspector is the name given to 1811 [[General Schedule (US civil service pay scale)|job series]] criminal investigators, better known as [[special agents]] in most other federal law enforcement agencies.

Prior to 2003, the US Customs Service (USCS) and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) had uniformed, law enforcement employees called Customs Inspectors and Immigration Inspectors.  These employees inspected and processed people and merchandise entering the United States from  foreign countries, at a land border, seaport or airport.  They wore different types of uniforms and had different duties, but were paid essentially the same.  After US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) was established with the merging of the above two agencies, the inspectors were retitled Customs and Border Protection Officers and merged their responsibilities.

=== Administrative law ===
In American [[administrative law]], an inspector is an official charged with the duty to issue permits, such as a [[building code|building inspector]] or [[sanitation]] inspector, and to enforce the relevant [[regulations]] and [[laws]]. These positions are commonly known as the Fire Inspector or Building Inspector.  The duty it act is based on the adopted building or fire code in the municipality.<ref>[http://inspector911.com/what-is-an-inspector/363 Inspector911.com]</ref> A government agency may also have an [[Inspector General]] responsible for preventing internal [[fraud]], waste, abuse and other agency deficiencies.

==In popular culture==
In fiction, "Inspector" is often used as a term and title for a [[detective]], even if their duties and role does not match that of an inspector in a Commonwealth police force. Examples of fictional inspectors include the characters [[Inspector Clouseau]], [[Inspector Gadget]], [[Inspector Zenigata]], [[Inspector Javert]], [[Inspector Lestrade]], [[Inspector Morse]], [[Inspector Palmu]], [[Kurt Wallander]], and Inspector Goole, the title character of ''[[An Inspector Calls]]''.
