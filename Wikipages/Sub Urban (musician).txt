== Biography ==

While raised in the suburbs of [[Ridgewood, New Jersey]], he began producing music at the age of 15.<ref>Cingrana, Joe. [https://www.audacy.com/alt923/blogs/joe-cingrana/ctrlaltdel-pick-of-the-week-sub-urban-freak "Ctrl+ALT+Del 'Pick of the Week': Sub Urban - 'Freak' ft. REI AMI"], [[WNYL (FM)]], June 8, 2020. Accessed April 6, 2021. "Danny Maisonneuve, professionally known as Sub Urban is a 19-year-old visionary singer/songwriter and record producer. Born in Nyack, New York to a Taiwanese mom and a French-Canadian dad, and raised in the suburbs of Ridgewood, New Jersey nearly all of his life, Danny began producing music digitally at the age of 15."</ref> He was trained in classical piano at the age of 6, but quit after claiming that he was "sick of playing other people's compositions". In the fall of 2016, Maisonneuve dropped out of high school to pursue his musical career, "isolating" himself to work on various demos and songs. The most popular song of his to come out of this period of self-isolation was "Cradles", which skyrocketed in popularity after being shared heavily on video-sharing application [[TikTok]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2019|title=Warner Records Press {{!}} Sub Urban|url=https://press.warnerrecords.com/sub-urban/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2021-01-21|website=[[Warner Records]]}}</ref>
