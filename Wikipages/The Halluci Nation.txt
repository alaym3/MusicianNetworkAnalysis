'''The Halluci Nation''', formerly known as '''A Tribe Called Red''', is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] electronic music group who blend instrumental [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[reggae]], [[moombahton]] and [[dubstep]]-influenced dance music with elements of [[First Nations music]], particularly vocal chanting and drumming.<ref name=urbanpowwow>[http://arts.nationalpost.com/2011/08/23/a-tribe-called-reds-urban-powwow/ "A Tribe Called Red’s urban powwow"] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.today/20130129143809/http://arts.nationalpost.com/2011/08/23/a-tribe-called-reds-urban-powwow/ |date=January 29, 2013 }}.

The group's former name was an homage to [[A Tribe Called Quest]], a hip hop group that also had songs that addressed [[African American]] social grievances.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bush|first1=John|title=A Tribe Called Quest|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/a-tribe-called-quest-mn0000478982/biography|website=AllMusic|access-date=18 September 2016}}</ref>

The group's music has been labelled as "powwow-step", a style of contemporary [[powwow]] music for urban [[First Nations]] in the [[dance club]] scene; popularized by the media as a description of the band's unique style, the term originated as the title of one of the band's own earliest singles.<ref name=urbanpowwow />

== Origins ==
Inspired by parties for Korean and South Asian youth in Ottawa, DJ NDN (Ian Campeau), a nightclub bouncer turned DJ, became interested in a similar event for [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] youth.<ref name=":0">{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/a-tribe-called-red|title=A tribe called Red|encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|access-date=August 31, 2019}}</ref> After discussing the idea with his friend, Bear Witness (Thomas Ehren Ramon), and fellow [[disc jockey]] Dee Jay Frame (Jon Limoges), they began the first night at Ottawa's Babylon nightclub in 2007, calling it Electric Pow Wow.<ref name=":0" /> Encouraged by the overwhelmingly positive response, the DJs began holding the event on the second weekend of every month — a schedule that lasted until December 2017.<ref name=":0" /> The parties featured a mixture of traditional [[Pow wow|powwow]] recordings from Campeau's youth, when he performed as a drummer, mixed with [[electronic music]] rhythms and genres such as [[dubstep]], [[moombahton]] and [[dancehall]].<ref name=":0" /> Bear Witness explained that the group was formed because its members wanted to throw parties for their community,<ref name="canadiandimension.com">{{Cite web|url=https://canadiandimension.com/articles/view/beats-against-colonialism-a-tribe-called-red|title=Beats Against Colonialism: A Tribe Called Red – Canadian Dimension|website=canadiandimension.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-20}}</ref> and he also pointed out ATCR's political connotation: "To take over and Indigenize the club space is a really political act [...] As First Nations people everything we do is political".<ref name="canadiandimension.com"/>

==Activism==
The band found its roots when Bear Witness and Ian Campeau realized their home city of Ottawa had dance nights that represented every culture there but their own, so deciding to, "throw a party," was more than just for fun—these Electric Pow Wows were to portray their Aboriginal culture within urban centres where historically, its involvement has been erased.<ref>{{Cite news|title=A look at A Tribe Called Red, a successful group of aboriginal DJs|date=July 21, 2013|work=The National - CBC Toronto|id = {{ProQuest|1406212424}}}}</ref> Thus, the band has been involved in activism from its very origin.

They have been vocal supporters of [[Idle No More]],<ref name="now" /> a peaceful revolution launched in November 2012 to protest the Harper government's introduction of [[Jobs and Growth Act|Bill C-45]], which critics, including many First Nations people, claimed threatened both the environment and Aboriginal sovereignty.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/idle-no-more|title=Idle No More|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=August 31, 2019}}</ref>

In 2013, they issued a public statement asking non-aboriginal fans to refrain from [[cultural appropriation]] by not wearing [[War bonnet|headdresses]] and [[Bodypainting|war paint]] to their shows. Furthermore, Campeau filed a [[human rights]] complaint against an amateur football club in Ottawa that was using "Redskins" as its club name. Also, through its piece "The Road", the band provided "catalyzing soundtrack to the Idle No More movement sweeping across Turtle Island",<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Levine|first=Gabriel|date=2016|title=Remixing Return: A Tribe Called Red's Decolonial Bounce|journal=Canadian Journal of Cultural Studies|volume=35|pages=27–46|doi=10.3138/topia.35.27}}</ref> advocating in favor of "Indigenous peoples reclaiming the land, moving to reverse the ongoing dispossessions of the settler state".<ref name=":02"/> The track has made some recall a series of walks along roads, like the "[[Longest Walk]]" from Alcatraz to Washington in 1978.<ref name=":02" />

In 2014, the band withdrew from a scheduled performance at the official opening ceremonies of the [[Canadian Museum for Human Rights]], citing concerns about the museum's depiction of indigenous human rights issues.

Further than distinct actions like the aforementioned, the group is also activist through the expression of their music itself. "I think in our own community," Bear Witness told ''[[The National (TV program)|The National]]'' in 2013, "it's not something that people would have been ready for us to have been doing 10 or 15 years ago, to be sampling powwow music and bring it into clubs. I mean, that's really pushing boundaries."<ref>{{Cite news|title=A look at A Tribe Called Red, a successful group of aboriginal DJs|work=The National - CBC Television Toronto|id = {{ProQuest|1406212424}}}}</ref> Using music as a platform to educate, they have broken away from homogenous genres and at once promoted appreciation and respect for First Nations cultures while combating stereotypes and appropriation.

"It's mind-blowing that this whole conversation that we've been having the past few decades about the portrayal of our people hasn't gone anywhere," said Bear Witness. "It hasn't changed."<ref name="The Globe and Mail, Toronto">{{Cite news|title=A Tribe Called Red reclaim their culture: Polaris-prize nominee using popularity to educate audiences about First Nations|work=The Globe and Mail, Toronto|id = {{ProQuest|1811383044}}}}</ref> However, the band is positive about making a change moving forward. "All those things that we're trying to talk about with Idle No More, with aboriginal rights, you're feeling it and you're getting it without a word having to be said. Because when you feel that, you're feeling what we all feel."<ref name="The Globe and Mail, Toronto"/>

In 2020, the band released "Land Back". The song was available for free and intended to show support to the [[Wetʼsuwetʼen]] [[First Nations]] who were opposing the construction of a [[Coastal GasLink Pipeline]]. The song was hoped to be used by those involved during the [[2020 Canadian pipeline and railway protests]].<ref name=":1" />

'''''Nation II Nation''''' (2013)

ATCR's second album was nominated for a Polaris Prize and it also had a political inclination as it contributed to the conversation that revolves around Indigenous rights and cultural appropriation.<ref name="canadiandimension.com"/> The name of the album has two layers of meaning. On one hand, the members of the group are originally from different communities, as Campeau explained: "I'm Ojibway, Anishinaabe. The other two guys, Dan and Bear are both Cayuga [...] Historically, we're enemies. So together, in forming this group, that's a nation-to-nation relationship".<ref name="canadiandimension.com"/> On the other hand, there is a "nation-to-nation relationship from the settler nations to the First Nations" (Ian "DJ NDN" Campeau).<ref name="canadiandimension.com"/>
