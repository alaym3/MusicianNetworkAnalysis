'''D-A-D''' is a Danish [[rock music|rock]] band. They were originally named "Disneyland After Dark",<ref name="LarkinHM"/> but changed their name to avoid a lawsuit from [[The Walt Disney Company]].

==History==
In the early 1980s in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, D-A-D started playing together under their original name ''Disneyland After Dark''. Pedersen came up with the name based on the idea that when the lights are out in [[Disneyland]], anything can happen. The first lineup of D-A-D consisted of Jesper, Stig, Peter and Stig's girlfriend, Lene Glumer. The band's debut concert was at the youth club Sundby Algaard. In December 1982, {{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Lene Glumer left the band and the three of them kept playing together and on March 3. 1984 Jesper's younger brother, Jacob, joined the band at a concert at Musikcaféen in Copenhagen.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The band released their first album, ''[[Call of the Wild (D-A-D album)|Call of the Wild]]'' in 1986.<ref name="LarkinHM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who’s Who of Heavy Metal]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1995|edition=Second|isbn=0-85112-656-1|page=92}}</ref>

The group made their international breakthrough in 1989 with the record ''[[No Fuel Left for the Pilgrims]]'' on [[Warner Records]],<ref name="LarkinHM"/> which was released on the band's fifth birthday. They achieved some airplay with the single "[[Sleeping My Day Away]]".{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
