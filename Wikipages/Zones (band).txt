'''Zones''' were a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[power pop]] and [[New wave music|new wave]] band founded in late 1977,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kinemagigz.com/'z'.htm |title=All The Acts / Bands Who Played The Kinema Ballroom Dunfermline - 'Z' |website=Kinemagigz.com |access-date=2016-10-13}}</ref> following the demise of PVC2 (formerly the bubbleglam and soft rock band [[Slik]]).

==Career==
PVC2 consisted of [[Midge Ure]] (future [[Ultravox]] frontman) on guitar, [[Russell Webb (musician)|Russell Webb]] on bass, [[Billy McIsaac]] on keyboards and [[Kenny Hyslop]] on drums. In late 1977, Ure left PVC2 to join [[Rich Kids]] with [[Glen Matlock]]. Then, Webb, Hyslop and McIsaac called in [[Alex Harvey (musician)|Alex Harvey]]'s cousin [[Willie Gardner]] to replace Ure on guitar and vocals, and Zones was formed.

In February 1978, Zones released a [[single (music)|single]] "[[Stuck with You (Zones song)|Stuck with You]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/zum4 |title=Zones - Stuck With You / No Angels - Zoom - UK - ZUM 4 |website=45cat.com |date=2014-01-26 |access-date=2016-10-13}}</ref> which attracted the attention of [[BBC Radio 1]] [[Disc jockey|DJ]] [[John Peel]], leading to the band recording a session for his show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/sessions/1970s/1978/May17zones/ |title=Radio 1 - Keeping It Peel - 17/05/1978 Zones |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=2016-10-13}}</ref> It also drew the attention of [[Arista Records]], who signed them and would release the rest of their discography.

Their next single, "Sign of the Times", released in July.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/arist205 |title=Zones - Sign Of The Times / Away From It All - Arista - UK - ARIST 205 |website=45cat.com |date=1978-08-04 |access-date=2016-10-13}}</ref> Zones also toured with [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]] and recorded a further session for John Peel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/sessions/1970s/1978/Sep13zones/ |title=Radio 1 - Keeping It Peel - 13/09/1978 Zones |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=2016-10-13}}</ref> On 1 June 1979, Zones released ''[[Under Influence]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Zones-Under-Influence/master/221924 |title=Zones (2) - Under Influence |website=Discogs.com |access-date=2016-10-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Dave Thompson |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/under-influence-mw0000848431 |title=Under Influence - Zones &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2016-10-13}}</ref><ref name="google1">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4WM6Cb1z-PwC&q=Under+Influence |title=Punk Diary: The Ultimate Trainspotter's Guide to Underground Rock, 1970-1982 |author=George Gimarc |year=2005 |page=Front cover |isbn=9780879308483 |access-date=2016-10-13}}</ref> an album of [[post-punk]] power pop.

Shortly afterwards, they released a 7" single called "Mourning Star",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/arist286 |title=Zones - Mourning Star / Under Influence - Arista - UK - ARIST 286 |website=45cat.com |access-date=2016-10-13}}</ref><ref name="google1" /> whose eponymous song (a shorter version of the album song) was backed with "Under Influence" (which did not appear on the album, despite the name being the same). They also had a song that was featured in the movie [[That Summer (1979 film)|''That Summer!'']] entitled "New Life." Shortly afterwards, the band decided to split up, as the album did not reach expectations.

Gardner joined [[Endgames (band)|Endgames]], with [[Simple Minds]]' original drummer [[Brian McGee (drummer)|Brian McGee]]. McIsaac and Hyslop continued with a project called Science, a band considered as a continuation of Zones, but only McIsaac was the supposedly remaining member.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/310094-Science-5 |title=Science (5) Discography |website=Discogs.com |access-date=2016-10-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://thezonesunderinfluence.blogspot.com/| title=ZONES - under influence| access-date=31 March 2009}}</ref> Webb and Hyslop joined [[Skids (band)|Skids]].

In 1990, McIsaac moved to study piano performance college at the [[Royal Conservatoire of Scotland|Royal Academy of Music]] in Glasglow, and later formed a self-titled wedding band, which he played in until retiring in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Band Directory|url=http://www.banddirectory.co.uk/band.asp?b=billy-mcisaac-band&t=glasgow&p=g626pg|access-date=2020-12-23|website=Band Directory}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2009-05-05|title=Home Page - Billy McIsaac Band - Scotland's No.1 Wedding Band|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505204745/http://www.billymcisaacband.co.uk/|access-date=2020-12-23|website=web.archive.org}}</ref>

Webb collaborated with Skids' singer [[Richard Jobson (television presenter)|Richard Jobson]] (Skids singer) until 1988, and Hyslop, after collaborating with Skids album, ''[[Joy (The Skids album)|Joy]]'', moved to Simple Minds (1981–1982) and later [[Set The Tone (band)|Set the Tone]] (1982–1983).
