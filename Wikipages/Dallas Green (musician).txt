'''Dallas Michael John Albert Green''' (born September 29, 1980) is a Canadian musician, singer, songwriter and record producer who records under the name '''City and Colour'''. He is also known for his contributions as a singer, rhythm guitarist and songwriter for the [[post-hardcore]] band [[Alexisonfire]]. In 2005, he debuted his first full-length album, ''Sometimes'', which achieved platinum certification in 2006. City and Colour began performing in small intimate venues between Alexisonfire tours.<ref name="dg-maple-bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.maplemusic.com/artists/cac/bio.asp|title=City and Colour Biography|publisher=MapleMusic|access-date=December 3, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225021900/http://www.maplemusic.com/artists/cac/bio.asp|archive-date=February 25, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The name ''City and Colour'' comes from his own name: ''[[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]]'', a city, and ''[[Green]]'', a colour. His reasoning for the name was that he felt uneasy "putting the album out under the name Dallas Green".<ref name="Interview">{{cite web |url=http://www.muchmusic.com/insidemuch/stuff/dallas_green_mellows_out_with_city_and_colour.asp |title=Dallas Green mellows out with City and Colour |publisher=Muchmusic.com |access-date=March 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830051919/http://www.muchmusic.com/insidemuch/stuff/dallas_green_mellows_out_with_city_and_colour.asp |archive-date=August 30, 2009 }}</ref>

Green has stated that he had gone without a name at first; his mother was considering naming him Graham-Todd Green, but his father had bet on the Phillies during the [[1980 World Series]] that October and, after the team won, his parents decided on the name Dallas after the Phillies' manager.<ref>[http://www.nowtoronto.com/blog/view_post.cfm?post=858/ Dallas's interview at the 2008 NXNE festival on June 18, 2008, courtesy of nowtoronto.com]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Last accessed November 16, 2008</ref>

Green started playing piano at the age of 8 and writing music since he was around the age of 14.<ref name="Interview"/> The first album that he bought with his own money was [[Alice in Chains]]' ''[[Dirt (Alice in Chains album)|Dirt]]'' (1992). He bought it on his 12th birthday, on September 29, 1992. Green said that if people want to get to the bottom of why he makes music the way that he does, it is because of Alice in Chains.<ref name="ig"/>

Regarding the songs released on his first album, ''[[Sometimes (City and Colour album)|Sometimes]]'', Green said that he had been writing material for it as early as when he was 16 years old, and finished writing songs for it in 2005.<ref name="Interview"/>

==Music career==
===Early work===
Before joining Alexisonfire, Green was in a band called Helicon Blue, producing several songs before breaking up. The three piece band also featured Marcel Lanteigne on bass and vocal, and Nicholas Osczypko on drums. The band recorded a self-titled release on their own, subsequently recording a second EP with Greg Below from [[Distort Entertainment]]. A collection of nine Helicon Blue tracks were released by Dine Alone Records in 2016 as a part of their 10-year anniversary celebrations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dallas Green's Helicon Blue Reissued as Part of Dine Alone's 10th Anniversary Celebrations |url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/dallas_greens_helicon_blue_reissued_as_part_of_dine_alones_10th_anniversary_celebrations |website=Exclaim.ca |access-date=June 13, 2019 |date=January 23, 2015}}</ref>

===Alexisonfire===
{{Further|Alexisonfire}}
Dallas began playing with Alexisonfire in late 2001. They released four albums (''[[Alexisonfire (album)|Alexisonfire]]'', ''[[Watch Out! (Alexisonfire album)|Watch Out!]]'', ''[[Crisis (Alexisonfire album)|Crisis]]'', and ''[[Old Crows / Young Cardinals]]'') and two EPs before disbanding in 2011 due to Dallas' decision to focus on his work in City and Colour full-time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spinner.com/2011/08/08/dallas-green-alexisonfire-split/ |title=Dallas Green Says Alexisonfire Was 'Killing' Him, Is Fine Being 'The Villain' After Split |publisher=Spinner.com |access-date=November 7, 2011}}</ref>

Dallas came up with the name of the band from an episode on Discovery Channel. This specific episode was about contortionism. In this show there was a segment on a stripper who added contortionism into her show, as well as lactating and breathing fire. The woman's stage name was Alexis Fire, and the segment was called Alexisonfire. He thought that this would be a cool name for a band, and that is where it all started.<ref name="dg-interview-2009">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDFNMxz4fMM|title=Alexisonfire (Dallas Green) Interview |publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=August 11, 2009|access-date=December 3, 2014}}</ref>

===City and Colour===
====''Sometimes'' (2005–2007)====
[[File:DallasGreenEdge2005.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Green performing at Edge102.1 Radio Studios in July 2005]]Green began releasing City and Colour songs on the [[internet]] for fans to download. Eventually, he compiled and rewrote several of these songs to make his first album, ''[[Sometimes (City and Colour album)|Sometimes]]''. The full-length debut was released on November 1, 2005, to a good reception, described by one reviewer as "dynamically gentle and vulnerable".<ref>{{cite web|author=(5 votes, average: 4.20 out of 5) |url=http://www.music-critic.ca/wp/2005/city-and-colour-sometimes/ |title=City and Colour - Sometimes |publisher=Music-critic.ca |date=November 1, 2005 |access-date=March 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706190627/http://www.music-critic.ca/wp/2005/city-and-colour-sometimes/ |archive-date=July 6, 2011 }}</ref> The cover art was designed by Scott McEwan, in a tattoo-esque style; Green "still may decide to have some of them inked at a later point in time".<ref name="Walrus">{{cite web|author=Diana Outos |url=http://www.yorku.ca/walrus/06-03/feature2.php |title=Dallas Green: An Introspective Look |website=Yorku.ca |access-date=March 2, 2011}}</ref>

Green indicated that his view that the "best music for [him] is sad music", influenced the type of songs he created. He also said that he "love[s] music to sort of escape to" and the idea of sad music that people could identify with. Green said of the album that, "a lot of those songs are written on some of the experiences I've been through and stuff and that's just how I deal with it. I just write songs when I'm bummed out and I feel happier."<ref name="Walrus"/> ''Sometimes'' won the 2007 Juno award for Alternative Album of the Year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Inside the Career of Alexisonfire, Canada's Greatest, Least Likely Success Story |url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/inside_the_career_of_alexisonfire_canadas_greatest_least_likely_success_story |website=Exclaim.ca |access-date=June 13, 2019 |date=April 22, 2019}}</ref>

In an interview with Radar Radio's Reegan McLaughlin, Green said 'I look at people like Bob Dylan back in the day and he'd have pages of lyrics and would have to decide out of seven, eight of nine verses which three were the best. I think to myself, I have to struggle to get two verses I am happy with in a song' Green also said 'I think melodies come relatively easy to me because I've been singing so long but lyrics, it's a battle to get to a point when I am happy with a song.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radarradio.com.au/artists/interview/radar-record-of-the-week-city-and-colour.aspx |title=Radar Record of the week City and Colour &#124; Radar Artists.
