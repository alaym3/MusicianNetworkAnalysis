{{nihongo|'''Ōmori'''|大森|}} is a district located a few kilometres south of [[Shinagawa]], [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] accessed by rail via the [[Keihin-Tohoku Line|Keihin Tohoku line]], or by road via Dai Ichi Keihin.  Ōmorikaigan, the eastern area of Ōmori, can be reached via the [[Keihin Electric Express Railway|Keikyu line]].

Ōmori is one of many areas in [[Tokyo]]'s largest ward, [[Ōta, Tokyo|Ōta-ku]], and was formerly home to the [[German School Tokyo Yokohama|German International School]] before its relocation to [[Yokohama]]. High quality residential and retail developments that the [[Germany|German]] school attracted are present in the Ōmori-sannō area.  Ōmori is home to the headquarters of the automotive company [[Isuzu]], which has offices in the Belport complex a few hundred metres from Ōmori station.

Prior to its development as a convenient{{to whom|date=May 2014}} residential and business location, Ōmori was laced with a network of small rivers which were used by many locals for drying harvested [[nori]] ([[seaweed]]){{clarify|date=May 2014}}, a staple of the Japanese diet.  Modern Ōmori is built on mostly reclaimed land, and is very much a traditional [[Shinto]] area; there are many [[Jinja (Shinto)|shrines]] in the area, and during the August [[Bon Festival|o-bon]] [[festival]], [[mikoshi]] parades are very common.

Ōmori-sannō, to the west of Ōmori station, is an upscale neighbourhood compared to the other side of the tracks, and Ōmori-sannō is known to be traditionally an area where [[Japan]]ese poets, philosophers and writers have made their home.

== World War II POW Camp ==
Ōmori was the site of an [[Imperial Japanese Army]]-administered [[prisoner-of-war camp]] during World War II. The inhumane conditions in the camp were described in detail in the book ''[[Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption]]'' describing the life of American Olympic Athlete [[Louis Zamperini]]. The camp was brutal, and included in its staff was known war criminal [[Mutsuhiro Watanabe]]. However, US Navy submarine commander [[Richard O'Kane]] found Omori camp harsh, but essentially correct in administration,{{what?|date=July 2021}} particularly compared with the [[Ōfuna (Prisoner of War Camp)|Ōfuna Imperial Japanese Navy detention centre]]. Local anti-militarist Japanese civilians sometimes helped the prisoners with small gifts of food.<ref>O'Kane, Richard H. ''Clear the Bridge!

== Two Omoris ==

Ōmori has two meanings:
# Area around JR Ōmori station.
# Town of Ōmori.
While Ōmori station opened in 1876 and is widely known to outsiders, the "town of Ōmori" was renamed in 1970 and is less known, and even local residents are often confused.  Broadly, the west side of JR Ōmori station is still Ōmori but generally speaking it is considered Sannō area, an uptown.{{clarify|date=May 2014}}
