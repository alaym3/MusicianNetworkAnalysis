"'''How Are Things in Glocca Morra?'''" is a [[popular music|popular]] [[song]] about a fictional village in [[Ireland]], with themes of nostalgia and homesickness. It was introduced by [[Ella Logan]] in the original 1947 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]''.

==Production==
The music was composed by [[Burton Lane]] and the lyrics were written by [[E.Y. Harburg]]. The song was published in [[1946 in music|1946]] and introduced in the 1947 [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]''. There is no actual Glocca Morra in Ireland (though there is a Glockamara). In a television interview late in his life, Harburg revealed that the name "Glocca Morra" was made up by composer Lane, who had devised a dummy lyric beginning with the line, "There's a glen in Glocca Morra". Harburg liked the name but insisted on changing the line to "How are things in Glocca Morra?" because this is personal and immediately evocative of nostalgia and homesickness.

[[James Stephens (author)|James Stephens']] work [[The Crock of Gold (novel)|''The Crock of Gold'']] (first published in 1912) refers to "the [[leprechaun]]s of Gort na Cloca Mora"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Alonso |first1=Harriet Hyman |title=Yip Harburg: Legendary Lyricist and Human Rights Activist |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJw1Cig8vzsC&pg=PA157 |date=January 2013 |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |isbn=9780819571243 |accessdate=11 October 2019}}</ref> (an approximation of ''gort na clocha m√≥ra'', "field of the big rocks" in [[Irish language|Irish]]). It is unknown whether Lane or Harburg were aware of the novel or whether this is a coincidence.
