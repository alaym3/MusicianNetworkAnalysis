==History==

===Formation and ''The Space Between'' EP (2011&ndash;2012)===
Intervals was formed in Toronto, Ontario in 2011 as a creative outlet for guitarist Aaron Marshall<ref name=prp>{{cite news|title=Intervals Drastically Revamp Lineup, Working On New Album With Darkest Hour & Protest The Hero Members|url=http://www.theprp.com/2015/06/23/news/intervals-drastically-revamp-lineup-working-on-new-album-with-darkest-hour-protest-the-hero-members/|access-date=25 November 2015|work=The PRP|date=23 June 2015}}</ref><ref name=metalinjectionrecap /> after quitting his previous band, "Speak of the Devil".{{citation needed|date=June 2018|reason=The recap Marshall posted on Facebook does not say he left Speak of the Devil, only that he played 'with local bands in Toronto.' Additional citations may be needed to support this.}} He recorded and programmed all the parts for ''The Space Between'' in his home studio, with mixing and mastering by Adam "Nolly" Getgood of [[Periphery (band)|Periphery]], and released independently on December 20, 2011.<ref name=thespacebetweenbandcamp>{{cite liner notes|url=https://intervalsmusic.bandcamp.com/album/the-space-between|title=The Space Between|author=Intervals|quote="Mixed & mastered by: Adam "Nolly" Getgood|website=Bandcamp|date=December 20, 2011}}</ref> Marshall attempted to form a full band including a vocalist, with the intention of turning Intervals into a touring act, but failed to do so.

===''In Time'' EP (2012&ndash;2013)===
With the release of their second EP ''In Time'' on October 30, 2012, Marshall was joined by Olly Steele (Monuments) and [[David Maxim Micic]] (Destiny Potato). Sputnik Music gave the EP a 4.0/Excellent rating, suggesting that "if they find a bit more creativity and increase their originality, they have potential to go down in history as one of the best instrumental prog metal bands. As of now, they are still not on the same level as [[Animals as Leaders]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/52919/Intervals-In-Time/ |title=Intervals - In Time |publisher=SputnikMusic.com |date=2013-10-23 |access-date=2013-10-16}}</ref> The band released a music video for "Epiphany" on April 25, 2013 via [[Guitar World]] promotion and [[YouTube]].<ref name="GuitarWorld.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/exclusive-intervals-premiere-epiphany-music-video |title=Exclusive: Intervals Premiere "Epiphany" Music Video |publisher=GuitarWorld.com |date=2013-04-25 |access-date=2013-10-16}}</ref> Following the success of ''In Time'', the band gained endorsement deals from Ernie Ball Music Man, Pearl Drums, Meinl Cymbals, Toontrack, InTune Guitar Picks, and Gruv Gear.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/guest-list-intervals-guitarist-aaron-marshall-picks-his-five-favorite-pieces-gear |title=Guest List: Intervals Guitarist Aaron Marshall Picks His Five Favorite Pieces of Gear |publisher=GuitarWorld.com |date=2012-12-20 |access-date=2013-10-16}}</ref> Marshall also released playthroughs and lessons for certain songs from the EP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/intervals-aaron-marshall-mata-hari-intro-riff-lesson |title=Intervals: Aaron Marshall "Mata Hari" Intro Riff Lesson |publisher=GuitarWorld.com |date=2012-11-29 |access-date=2013-10-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/exclusive-play-through-video-intervals-alchemy |title=Exclusive Play-Through Video: Intervals — "Alchemy" |publisher=GuitarWorld.com |date=2013-03-27 |access-date=2013-10-16}}</ref>

===''A Voice Within'' (2013&ndash;2015)===
On September 14, 2013, Intervals announced they would be entering the studio with producer Jordan Valeriote ([[Silverstein (band)|Silverstein]], Structures, Counterparts) on November 4 to begin tracking their upcoming release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lambgoat.com/news/21130/Intervals-prepare-to-record-new-album |title=Intervals prepare to record new album |publisher=LambGoat.com |date=2013-09-15 |access-date=2013-10-16}}</ref> Following the studio, Intervals were scheduled to tour Europe (January - February 2014) with Protest The Hero, [[Tesseract (band)|TesseracT]], and The Safety Fire.<ref name="MetalUnderground.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=95642 |title=Intervals To Record New Album In November |publisher=MetalUnderground.com |date=2013-09-14 |access-date=2013-10-16}}</ref> On December 30, it was announced that bassist Mike Semesky would be changing his role in the band and provide vocals on the new album; as a result, the album's bass tracks were handled equally by Marshall and Valeriote. The band released Semesky's vocal debut in the form of new single ‘Ephemeral’ via RevolverMag.com, as well as a revelation that the new album would be titled ''A Voice Within''.<ref name=Ephemeraldebut>{{cite web|url=http://www.revolvermag.com/?p=56184 |title=Exclusive: Intervals Premiere New Song, "Ephemeral" |publisher=RevolverMag.com |date=2013-12-30 |access-date=2013-12-30}}</ref>

Due to the need for Semesky to focus entirely on his vocal performance live, the band hired Henry Selva (formerly of [[The Human Abstract (band)|The Human Abstract]]) as their live bassist for their upcoming tours. {{quote|text="I'm extremely happy to announce that I am the singer of Intervals. I joined the band on bass in early 2013, but after writing and experimenting with vocals over demos of the band's new material, the four of us knew that that was the direction we were meant to go. I feel so blessed to be a part of such a talented group of musicians and I'm extremely proud of the album we all worked so hard on. We can't wait for you all to hear it!"<ref name=Ephemeraldebut/>}} The band released a second song from the album, "The Escape", on January 23, 2014 and announced that the album would be released on March 4, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=blabbermouth.net|title=INTERVALS: New Song "The Escape" Available For Streaming|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/intervals-new-song-the-escape-available-for-streaming/|date=2014-01-23|access-date=2014-02-26}}</ref> On February 26, the band announced that they would be releasing one new song from the album per day until the day of the album's release. The first of these songs was "The Self Surrendered".<ref name=Theselfsurrenderedarticle>{{cite web|publisher=revolvermag.com|title=Exclusive: Intervals Premier New Song, "The Self Surrendered" It was announced on November 25, 2014 on their Facebook that Mike Semesky is parting ways with the band. |url=http://www.revolvermag.com/news/exclusive-intervals-premiere-new-song-the-self-surrendered.html|date=2014-02-26|access-date=2014-02-26}}</ref>

===Departure, ''The Shape of Color'', and ''The Way forward'' (2015&ndash;present)===

On November 25, 2014, Mike Semesky was announced to have left the band. An instrumental version of ''A Voice Within'' was then released on March 3, 2015. On June 23, three months after, Guyader and Sastry announced on Facebook that they would no longer be a part of Intervals. This separation was caused by different expectations about the direction of the band:

{{quote|"With one more show in 2014 with Protest The Hero and Unearth, this was the first time in well over a year that we were returning to our roots and performing as an instrumental band again. For me, the show felt like a place that I had been missing for so long. It felt like coming home and I was ecstatic. [...] It was clear that the same sentiment was not shared between us. Anup and Lukas wanted to continue searching for a new frontman, and myself and our manager were not comfortable with this. We went back and forth for some time and there was no clear resolution, but I couldn't deny my instinct to resume playing instrumental music, the way this all began."<ref name=metalinjectionrecap />}}

Marshall then introduced new studio musicians, bassist Cameron McLellan (Protest The Hero) and drummer Travis Orbin (Darkest Hour, ex-Periphery, Sky Eats Airplane), to work on the band's next album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heavyblogisheavy.com/2015/06/23/intervals-announce-departure-of-lukas-anup/|title=Lukas Guyader and Anup Sastry Out of Intervals, Cameron McLellan and Travis Orbin Now In|work=Heavy Blog Is Heavy|date=June 23, 2015}}</ref><ref name=metalinjectionrecap>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/breakups/intervals-guitarist-ditches-entire-lineup-goes-back-to-being-instrumental|title=INTERVALS Guitarist Ditches Entire Lineup, Goes Back To Being Instrumental|first=Greg|last=Kennelty|date=June 23, 2015|work=Metal Injection}}</ref> On December 4, 2015, Intervals released ''The Shape of Color''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kennelty|first1=Greg|title=INTERVALS to release all-instrumental new Album The Shape of Color this December|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/av/intervals-to-release-all-instrumental-new-album-the-shape-of-color-this-december|website=Metal Injection|access-date=25 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/news/intervals-premieres-new-album-shape-colour|title=Intervals premieres new Album, 'The Shape of Color'|date=November 30, 2015|first=Damian|last=Fanelli|work=Guitar World}}</ref><ref name=prp />

On October 24, 2017, Intervals announced ''The Way Forward'', a new album with McLellan returning to bass, and new drummer Nathan Bulla, who had been playing live with the band until the release.<ref name="axs2017">{{cite web|url=https://www.axs.com/intervals-announce-new-album-the-way-forward-124544|title=Intervals announce new album 'The Way Forward'|work=axs|first=Terrance|last=Pryor|date=October 24, 2017}}</ref> Marshall continues to be the only official member of the band, despite having returning members for tours and studio recordings.

On November 13th, 2020, the band released ''Circadian'', which featured collaborations with a number of artists.
