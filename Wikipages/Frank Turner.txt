==Musical career==
===Beginnings and Million Dead===
{{Main|Million Dead}}
The first record Turner owned was the album ''[[Killers (Iron Maiden album)|Killers]]'' by [[Iron Maiden]]. Metal was the first genre of music he fell in love with, and he remains a passionate fan.<ref name="Interview: Frank Turner">{{cite web|url=http://entertaimnet.wordpress.com/2013/05/27/frank-turner-from-battersea-to-usa-interview/ |title=Interview: Frank Turner |website=Entertaim.net |date=27 May 2013 |access-date=27 May 2013}}</ref> Turner's musical career began at school, with the short-lived alternative band Kneejerk. The band released three records and played several shows around the UK. The last record, their only full-length, was entitled ''The Half Life of Kissing'' and was released by Yorkshire DIY hardcore label Sakari Empire after the band had broken up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/nowwemust/main.html|title=Kneejerk official site|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/nowwemust/main.html&date=2009-10-25+23:50:00|archive-date=25 October 2009|url-status=dead}} ({{cite web|url=http://kneejerk.sampablokuper.com|title=Authorised mirror of Kneejerk official site}})</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Kneejerk – The Half-Life of Kissing|url = http://www.discogs.com/Kneejerk-The-Half-Life-of-Kissing/release/1992420|website = Discogs|access-date = 17 January 2016}}</ref>

In 2001, Turner joined London post-[[hardcore punk|hardcore]] band [[Million Dead]] at the invitation of former Kneejerk drummer Ben Dawson.<ref name="hippieburner.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hippieburner.com/MDsite/index2.html |title=Archive of defunct Million Dead official site |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925065952/http://www.hippieburner.com/MDsite/index2.html |archive-date=25 September 2008}}</ref> In 2005, after four years and two albums, the band announced that they were parting ways, as "irreconcilable differences within the band mean that it would be impossible to continue."<ref name="hippieburner.com"/> Around that time Turner got a tape with [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s ''[[Nebraska (album)|Nebraska]]'' on it – later he claimed that "that was a really big moment for me hearing that record in terms of a turn around in my music career, from hardcore punk bands to what I’m doing now."<ref name="boss turn around">{{cite web|url = http://entertaimnet.wordpress.com/2013/05/27/frank-turner-from-battersea-to-usa-interview/|title = Frank Turner Interview|date = 27 May 2013|website = entertaimnet|last = Hannig|first = Martin}}</ref>

{{Main|Love Ire & Song}}
Turner's first solo shows took place prior to the break-up of [[Million Dead]], with a set at the [[Smalltown America]] all-dayer at 93 Feet East in London. After the band's split, Turner felt that "it seemed like the logical thing to do to try my hand at playing these songs more publicly and more concertedly than before".<ref name="Biography on Frank-Turner.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.frank-turner.com/bio.html |title=Biography on Frank-Turner.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217095300/http://frank-turner.com/bio.html |archive-date=17 February 2009}}</ref> Turner states that "when [[Million Dead]] finished, I wanted to stay on tour, but I didn’t want the hassle of putting a band together."<ref>{{cite web|last=Miller |first=Campbell |url=http://stereokill.net/2008/11/11/interview-frank-turner/ |title=Interview: Frank Turner |website=Stereokill.net |access-date=18 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117004931/http://stereokill.net/2008/11/11/interview-frank-turner/ |archive-date=17 January 2016}}</ref>

After a split EP with rock band [[Reuben (band)|Reuben]], Turner's first solo EP, ''[[Campfire Punkrock]]'', was released in May 2006 on [[Xtra Mile Recordings]], with him being recorded and backed by Oxford band [[Dive Dive]] whom he had met while out on tour with Reuben.<ref name="Biography on Frank-Turner.com"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rosannahynes.blogspot.com/2010/04/frank-turner-interview.html |title=Frank Turner Interview|website=Rosannahynes.blogspot.com|access-date=18 December 2012}}</ref> Band members [[Tarrant Anderson]], [[Ben Lloyd]] and [[Nigel Powell]] would become his backing band from this point on, with most of his subsequent UK headline tours being full band shows.

After touring in support of American singer-songwriter [[Jonah Matranga]], the two released a [[Jonah Matranga / Frank Turner Split|split EP]] in August 2006.

In September, he was the last act to appear on [[Steve Lamacq]]'s "Lamacq Live" show on [[BBC Radio 1]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.frank-turner.com/2006_09_01_archive.html |title=Frank Turner blog archive – January 2006 |website=Frank-turner.com |access-date=18 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818044532/http://www.frank-turner.com/2006_09_01_archive.html |archive-date=18 August 2012}}</ref>

Turner's debut full-length studio album, ''[[Sleep Is for the Week]]'' was released in January 2007, again recorded at [[Dive Dive]]'s studio, produced by their guitarist [[Ben Lloyd]] and featuring drummer Nigel Powell.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

After an extensive tour, including dates supporting [[yourcodenameis:milo]] and [[Biffy Clyro]], and an appearance at [[SXSW]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.frank-turner.com/2007_03_01_archive.html |title=Frank Turner blog archive – March 2007 |website=Frank-turner.com |access-date=18 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818044050/http://www.frank-turner.com/2007_03_01_archive.html |archive-date=18 August 2012}}</ref> Turner released an EP, ''[[The Real Damage]]'', in May 2007.

After a further tour with [[Jonah Matranga]] and [[Jacob Golden]], the "All About The Destination" DVD was released in October 2007, before Turner returned to the studio in [[Hampshire, England|Hampshire]] to record his second album. The album, ''[[Love Ire & Song]]'' again saw [[Ben Lloyd]] from [[Dive Dive]] in the producer's seat,<ref name="rm13">{{cite web|url=http://www.roomthirteen.com/cgi-bin/feature_view.cgi?FeatureID=570|title=Room Thirteen Album Review|website=Roomthirteen.com|access-date=18 December 2012}}</ref> and was released on 31 March 2008, followed by an extensive UK tour with [[Andy Yorke]] and [[Chris T-T]]. T-T also joined the live lineup on keyboards through summer 2008.

During summer 2008, Turner made several festival appearances, including sets at [[Y Not Festival]], [[Two Thousand Trees Festival]], the [[Cambridge Folk Festival]], [[Truck Festival|Truck]], [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]], Jam by the Lake (in Durham) and the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]].

In October/November, during his 2008 UK Tour for the ''[[Love, Ire and Song]]'' album, he became ill with [[gastroenteritis]], and was forced to leave the stage in Nottingham halfway through his set. All remaining shows, which included [[Nottingham]], [[Liverpool]] and [[Ireland]], were cancelled, the first time that Turner as a solo artist had cancelled any show in ten years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.frank-turner.com/2008_11_01_archive.html |title=November 2008 |website=Frank-turner.com |access-date=18 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818044125/http://www.frank-turner.com/2008_11_01_archive.html |archive-date=18 August 2012}}</ref> He went on to reschedule all cancelled shows in January 2009.

In December 2008, Turner released ''[[The First Three Years]]'', a compilation of demos, b-sides and covers that were not featured on either of his first two studio albums.

===''Poetry of the Deed'' (2009–2010)===
{{Main|Poetry of the Deed}}
In January 2009, Turner released a combined package of ''[[Love Ire & Song]]'' and ''[[The First Three Years]]'', and supported [[the Gaslight Anthem]] on their tour of the UK and Europe, demoing several new songs and announcing his plans to record a new album.

The new album was produced by Alex Newport. Recording took place in April and May 2009 at Leeders Farm in [[Norwich]] and the producer's own studio, Future Shock, in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]].

Turner's band at the time still consisted of [[Ben Lloyd]], [[Tarrant Anderson]] and [[Nigel Powell]] from [[Dive Dive]], with keyboardist [[Matt Nasir]] having been added on the ''[[Love, Ire and Song]]'' tour.

Prior to recording ''[[Poetry of the Deed]]'', Turner stated that:<ref>{{cite web | author=Miller, Campbell | title=Interview: Frank Turner | date=4 April 2009 | url=http://stereokill.net/2009/04/04/interview-frank-turner-2/ | website=Stereokill.net | access-date=6 April 2009 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721012115/http://stereokill.net/2009/04/04/interview-frank-turner-2/ | archive-date=21 July 2009}}</ref> {{cquote|The new album is about 75% written – in the sense that the songs, as skeletons, are done, but this time round I’m rehearsing the material with my band before we record, so I’m sure that some things will change in terms of structure and arrangement as we settle into them. We’re recording the album as a band this time round, I’m really excited about it, the guys I play with are phenomenal musicians, and hopefully this way I’ll be able to close the gap a little between live and studio. Material-wise I’m really happy about where I am at the moment, though not complacent; there's a fair amount of pressure for this record, from me more than anyone else. The album is going to be called ''Poetry of the Deed''.}}

Turner was announced as the support act on [[The Offspring]]'s summer tour, during which he documented his travels with a blog on British music website ''[[NME]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idiomag.com/peek/93275/modest_mouse|title=Modest Mouse Confirm EP Details|access-date=24 July 2009|date=23 July 2009|website=[[Idiomag]]}}</ref> When talking about the support slot, Turner stated: "''[[Smash (The Offspring album)|Smash]]'' was one of the first punk records I ever bought, and I’m blown away to even be considered for the shows. From a "career" point of view, it's also great – playing to many thousands of people a night across the States is an opportunity not to be sniffed at."<ref>{{cite web |author=Lindsay, Andrew |title=Frank Turner to tour with The Offspring |date=9 April 2009 |url=http://stereokill.net/2009/04/09/frank-turner-to-tour-with-the-offspring/ |website=Stereokill.net |access-date=9 April 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721033125/http://stereokill.net/2009/04/09/frank-turner-to-tour-with-the-offspring/ |archive-date=21 July 2009}}</ref>

On 28 April 2009, Turner signed with [[Epitaph Records]] for releases outside the UK.<ref>{{cite web|last=Miller |first=Campbell |url=http://stereokill.net/2009/04/29/frank-turner-signs-to-epitaph/ |title=Frank Turner Signs To Epitaph |website=Stereokill.net |access-date=18 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117004931/http://stereokill.net/2009/04/29/frank-turner-signs-to-epitaph/ |archive-date=17 January 2016}}</ref>

Turner's third studio album, [[Poetry of the Deed]], was released on 7 September 2009, and reached No. 36 in the UK album chart. The album's first single, "The Road", received the status of 'Hottest Record in the World Today' by [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[Zane Lowe]] on 14 July 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=17714|title=Poetry Of The Deed by Frank Turner|website=Songfacts.com|access-date=1 July 2018}}</ref> The track, "Poetry of the Deed," was released as the second single from the album.

In late 2009, Turner embarked upon a UK tour with his band in support of the album (with singer-songwriter [[Beans On Toast]] and US band [[Fake Problems]] as support acts), culminating in a sell-out show at the [[O2 Shepherd's Bush Empire]] on 29 October 2009. A live DVD/CD, entitled ''Take to the Road'', documenting two shows from the tour ([[O2 Shepherd's Bush Empire]] and the [[Union Chapel, Islington|Union Chapel]]) was released in the UK in March 2010.

In November 2009, Turner toured the US alongside [[Chuck Ragan]], [[Jim Ward (musician)|Jim Ward]], [[Tim Barry]], [[Joey Cape]], [[Dave Hause]], and others, as part of the 2009 [[Revival Tour]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parasitesandsycophants.com/2009/10/22/frank-turner-the-revival-tour-with-chuck-ragan-jim-ward-tim-barry/ |title=Frank Turner:: The Revival Tour with Chuck Ragan, Jim Ward, Tim Barry... &#124; Parasites & Sycophants |website=Parasitesandsycophants.com |date=22 October 2009 |access-date=18 December 2012}}</ref> Turner returned to Europe on 28 November and to the UK on 19 December. He completed the year with a New Year's Eve show at The Spiegeltent in Gloucester.

In early 2010, Turner played several more UK gigs, with [[Chuck Ragan]] and [[Crazy Arm]] supporting. He also accompanied [[Flogging Molly]] and [[Architects (American band)|The Architects]] on the 2010 Green 17 Tour, and announced via his Twitter that he was working on new songs.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=frankturner|author=Frank Turner|number=7993947688|date=20 January 2010|title=Finishing new songs.

In June 2010 he supported [[Green Day]] on their stadium shows, and also featured as the cover star of ''[[Kerrang!]]'' magazine for the first time, with an article inside documenting his solo career up to that point.

Turner played at many festivals throughout the summer of 2010, including his headlining appearance at the [[Two Thousand Trees Festival]], playing his new song "I Still Believe". The song was released first as a single and then appeared on his ''[[Rock & Roll (EP)|Rock & Roll EP]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://frank-turner.com/blog/2010/10/ep-day-approacheth/ |title=EP-Day Approacheth! |website=Frank-turner.com |date=25 October 2010 |access-date=18 December 2012}}</ref> Turner also contributed one song, a cover of "[[Build Me Up Buttercup]]", to [[Centrepoint (charity)|Centrepoint]]'s 2010 charity cover album ''1969 Key to Change''.<ref name="Key to Change">[http://www.centrepoint.org.uk/key-to-change] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715174034/http://www.centrepoint.org.uk/key-to-change|date=15 July 2010}}</ref>

There's still a fair bit of 'rock' material on the record, but there's a lot more folky, acoustic material this time around than last time. I'm not taking any drastic stylistic turns here, but there are little forays into new territory at the edges. 'Poetry' was definitely off to one side of the spectrum for me. This record is a bit more down the middle. There's even an acappella tune on there. But then there's a pretty full-on hardcore song as well.}}

He was interviewed by a blue-haired Scottish puppet journalist called Gloria McGlumpher and performed a version of his own song ''The Road'' which featured a combination of his own original lyrics and parody lyrics written by Scott Doonican when his band celebrated their 1000th show a year earlier. During the interview, Turner describes it as "the best interview I've ever done".

==Lost Evenings Festival==

In early 2017, it was announced that Turner was to start his own festival. Named 'Lost Evenings', the festival was announced as a 4-day festival celebrating live music and community.

Performances are typically split across two stages, the main stage and the 'Nick Alexander Stage', the latter being named after Turner's long-term friend and merchandise manager, who was tragically killed in the [[Bataclan concert hall attack|Bataclan attack]] in 2015.

Lost Evenings sees Frank Turner curate and headline four consecutive one-off concerts on the main stage with an exciting supporting cast of musical talent. The 'Nick Alexander Stage' plays host to some of the best emerging acts all handpicked by Turner and [[Radio X (United Kingdom)|Radio X]] DJ, John Kennedy.

Complementing the festival are sideshows called Last Minutes. These tend to be events such as small acoustic performances or DJ sets.

In addition to the evening performances, OneFest (a UK-based, non-profit, music industry development company set up to support the emergence of new talent) run a selection of events during the day, that include panels focusing on The Business, Women & The Industry, Getting Gigs, Mental Health and the Digital Generation. These are events that offer inspiration, insight and advice to young individuals both operating in and trying to break in to the music industry.

In September 2017, Turner and Lost Evenings won the Best Independent Festival Award at the [[AIM Independent Music Awards]] run by the [[Association of Independent Music]].

The first Lost Evenings took place on 12th – 15 May 2017 at iconic [[Camden Town|Camden]] music venue, the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]]. Turner performed two greatest hits sets, as well as a full run through of his debut album, [[Sleep Is for the Week]]. Amongst other artists, Turner was supported by [[Seth Lakeman]] and [[Beans On Toast (musician)|Beans On Toast]].<ref>{{cite web |title=FULL LINEUP FOR FRANK TURNER'S LOST EVENINGS FESTIVAL ANNOUNCED |url=http://www.1.xtramilerecordings.com/news/2017/4/12/full-lineup-for-frank-turners-lost-evenings-festival-last-minutes-sideshows-announced |website=Xtra Mile Recordings |access-date=5 June 2020}}</ref>

Turner returned to the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]] for the second Lost Evenings festival which took place on 11th – 14 May 2018. As well as his 3 other sets, Turner performed his second studio album, [[Love Ire & Song]] in full. Other artists on the main stage included [[The Subways]], [[Emily Barker]] and [[Arkells]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Frank Turner Presents Lost Evenings 2 |url=https://giggoer.com/2018/04/05/frank-turner-presents-lost-evenings-2/ |website=Gig Goer |access-date=5 June 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=MORE ACTS FOR FRANK TURNER'S LOST EVENINGS II ANNOUNCED |url=http://www.1.xtramilerecordings.com/news/2018/4/10/more-acts-for-frank-turners-lost-evenings-ii-nick-alexander-stage-lineup-announced |website=Xtra Mile Recordings |access-date=5 June 2020}}</ref>

Lost Evenings 3 moved away from London in 2019 and took place at the [[House of Blues]], [[Boston]], on 16th – 19 May 2019. As well as greatest hits and acoustic sets, Turner performed his third studio album, [[Poetry of the Deed]] in full. Singer-Songwriter, [[Loudon Wainwright III]] and [[The Hold Steady]] also performed alongside Turner on the main stage.<ref>{{cite web |title=Frank Turner announces full line-up for 2019's Lost Evenings Festival |url=https://www.music-news.com/news/Tickets/121674/Frank-Turner-announces-full-line-up-for-2019-s-Lost-Evenings-Festival |website=Music News |access-date=5 June 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Frank Turner Announces 2019 Lost Evenings III Lineup Featuring Against Me!, Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls and The Hold Steady |url=https://music.mxdwn.com/2019/05/06/news/frank-turner-announces-2019-lost-evenings-iii-lineup-featuring-against-me-frank-turner-and-the-sleeping-souls-and-the-hold-steady/ |access-date=5 June 2020}}</ref>

Lost Evenings 4 was scheduled to take place at the Arena, [[Berlin]] on 21st – 24 May 2020. It was originally due to take place at Berlin's well-loved Astra venue, but tickets sold out very quickly due to high demand. As a consequence, the venue was changed. Artists scheduled to also play the main stage included [[Catfish and the Bottlemen]] and [[KT Tunstall]]. However, as a consequence of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] of 2020, the festival was cancelled.<ref>{{cite web |title=Frank Turner announces Lost Evenings IV |url=https://originalrock.net/2020/01/15/frank-turner-announces-lost-evenings-iv/ |website=Original Rock |access-date=5 June 2020}}</ref>

Following the cancellation of the Berlin edition due to Covid 19, the new date for Lost Evenings 4 was once more announced to be held at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]], this time on 16th-19 September 2021.<ref>https://www.nme.com/news/music/frank-turner-announces-details-of-lost-evenings-iv-festival-2956009</ref>

==Independent Venue Love==
During the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] of 2020, Turner performed a weekly show from his own home on his Facebook and YouTube channels to raise money for independent grassroot music venues that were forced to temporarily close due to the pandemic.

Talking about the online shows, Turner told ''NME'':
<blockquote>I’m very wary of telling people what to do in general, but one of the things I want to say to other artists is that this is fun. There are benefits to me in that it keeps people talking and if you can get 8,000–10,000 people tuning into you playing in your front room, then why not? You’re not losing out by doing something like this. There’s endless time at the moment and it’s so easy to do. I’m somewhat of a technophobe but I literally put my laptop on a pile of books, press one button to make this work and that’s it. None of us would have a career without these venues existing. None of us would have the music we love, so pay something back.</blockquote><ref name="auto2">{{cite web |title=Frank Turner urges other artists to "give something back" to grassroots venues facing closure |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/frank-turner-urges-other-artists-give-something-back-grassroots-venues-facing-closure-2640705 |website=NME |access-date=8 June 2020}}</ref>

Turner played one of his albums in full on each of the livestreams, and save for one exception, did not repeat one song during all the online shows. The one exception was the song "Silent Key", which appears on both ''[[Positive Songs for Negative People]]'' and ''[[No Man's Land (Frank Turner album)|No Man's Land]]''. As well as the full album shows, he also played a couple of covers sets, including a set of songs that appear in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films and one set featuring songs by his good friends.

Turner played a total of 21 'Independent Venue' shows and 2 other shows which were specifically to raise money for his band and touring crew and his publishing label, [[Xtra Mile Recordings]]. All but one show, Independent Venue Love 13, took place at Turner's home. The 13th show was streamed live from the [[Clapham Grand]], where he was joined by [[Billy Bragg]] and [[Beans On Toast (musician)|Beans On Toast]]. Turner raised in excess of £260,000 across the 23 shows.

Speaking about the human impact of losing venues, Turner said:
<blockquote>Running a small venue is a business model that runs on small margins, generally from month-to-month or week-to-week and the current closures puts them in very immediate danger – threatening longterm and deeply profound damage to the scene as a whole. Underground music and culture cannot exist unless it has somewhere to exist. There are acts like me, [[Biffy Clyro]], [[Ed Sheeran]] and [[Adele]] who needed time to incubate, find their voice, develop and grow – and we couldn't have done that without these places existing. But it's not just about incubating future stars, there are tonnes of bands who only exist in small grassroots venues and only ever will. They’re still absolutely valid, and if they don't have a place to perform their art then they can't do it. They just won't exist anymore.</blockquote><ref name="auto2"/>

==Politics==
Turner describes himself as a "classical liberal". He has a tattoo of {{lang|sux|[[ama-gi]]}}, [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] [[cuneiform]] for "freedom", on his left forearm. Turner received [[death threats]] following a news article from ''[[The Guardian]]'' that drew attention to his political outlook. In a subsequent ''Guardian'' interview, Turner clarified his views, "The non-Marxist British left is a fantastic tradition: it's all about non-conformism and voluntarism. The advances of the unions are great advances in human society."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/24/frank-turner-death-threats | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Mark | last=Beaumont | title=Frank Turner: 'I got 100 death threats a day' | date=24 April 2013}}</ref>

In 2013, Turner became a patron of the assisted dying campaign group [[Dignity in Dying]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dignityindying.org.uk/patron/frank-turner/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=23 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030000048/http://www.dignityindying.org.uk/patron/frank-turner/ |archive-date=30 October 2013}}</ref> In 2016, he was appointed a patron of [[Humanists UK]] (formerly the British Humanist Association), which campaigns on a number of ethical and [[secularism|secularist]] issues, including assisted dying.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://humanism.org.uk/2016/11/01/frank-turner-appointed-patron-of-the-bha/|title=Frank Turner appointed Patron of the BHA|date=1 November 2016|access-date=1 November 2016|work=[[British Humanist Association]]}}</ref>

Turner is a friend of [[Billy Bragg]], noted for his left-wing politics. He performs at the Left Field at [[Glastonbury Festival]].

In the past, Turner was [[straight edge]] for five years, and was vegetarian for eleven years.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=28 November 2017|url=http://thelinc.co.uk/2009/02/introducing-frank-turner/|title=Introducing Frank Turner|publication-date=19 February 2009 |first=Ashley |last=Partridge|publisher=[[Siren FM]]|website=Thelinc.co.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20131104092126/http://thelinc.co.uk/2009/02/introducing-frank-turner/|archive-date=4 November 2013}}</ref>
