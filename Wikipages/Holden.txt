'''Holden''', formerly known as '''General Motors-Holden''', was an Australian automobile marque owned by [[General Motors]] and as well a former [[automobile manufacturer]], which manufactured cars in Australia before switching to importing cars under the Holden brand. It was headquartered in [[Port Melbourne]].

The company was founded in 1856 as a [[saddle]]ry manufacturer in [[South Australia]]. In 1908, it moved into the automotive field before later becoming a subsidiary of the United States–based [[General Motors]] (GM) in 1931, when the company was renamed '''General Motors-Holden's Ltd'''. It was renamed '''Holden Ltd''' in 1998, adopting the name '''GM Holden Ltd''' in 2005.

In the past, Holden has offered [[Badge engineering|badge-engineered]] models due to sharing arrangements with [[Chevrolet]], [[Isuzu]], [[Nissan]], [[Opel]], [[Suzuki]], [[Toyota]], and [[Vauxhall Motors]]. In previous years, the vehicle lineup consisted of models from [[GM Korea]], GM Thailand, GM North America, and self-developed models like the [[Holden Commodore]], [[Holden Caprice]], and the [[Holden Ute]]. Holden also distributed the European Opel brand in Australia in 2012 until its Australian demise in mid-2013.<ref>{{cite web |last=Campbell |first=Matt |date=2 August 2013 |title=Opel Australia shuts its doors |url=http://news.drive.com.au/drive/motor-news/opel-australia-shuts-its-doors-20130802-2r4ch.html |work=Drive |access-date=26 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811212146/http://news.drive.com.au/drive/motor-news/opel-australia-shuts-its-doors-20130802-2r4ch.html |archive-date=11 August 2013 }}</ref>

Holden briefly owned assembly plants in New Zealand during the early 1990s. The plants had belonged to General Motors  from 1926 until 1990 in an earlier and quite separate operation from GM's Holden investment in Australia. From 1994 to 2017, all Australian-built Holden vehicles were manufactured in Elizabeth, South Australia, and engines were produced at the [[Fishermans Bend]] plant in Melbourne. Historically, production or assembly plants were operated in all mainland [[States and territories of Australia|states of Australia]]. The consolidation of final assembly at Elizabeth was completed in 1988, but some assembly operations continued at [[Dandenong, Victoria]] until 1994.

Although Holden's involvement in exports has fluctuated since the 1950s, the declining sales of large cars in Australia led the company to look to international markets to increase profitability {{when|date=January 2021}}. From 2010, Holden incurred losses due to the strong Australian dollar, and reductions of government grants and subsidies.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25328924 |title=GM's Holden to stop making cars in Australia |date=11 December 2013 |work=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> This led to the announcement, on 11 December 2013, that Holden would cease vehicle and engine production by the end of 2017.<ref>{{cite web |title=Holden to cease local production in 2017 |url=http://www.ausmotive.com/2013/12/11/holden-to-cease-local-production-in-2017.html |publisher=AUSmotive.com |access-date=11 December 2013 |date=11 December 2013}}</ref> On 20 October 2017, the last existing vehicle plant, located in Elizabeth, was closed as the production of the Holden Commodore ended.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-10-20/holden-closing-for-the-last-time-today/9061854 |title=Holden: Last vehicle rolls off production line as Australian car manufacturing ends |date=20 October 2017 |publisher=ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)}}</ref> On 17 February 2020, General Motors announced that the Holden brand would be retired by 2021.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-17/holden-car-brand-axed-after-160-years-in-australia/11972092 | title=Holden car brand, maker of Commodore and Barina, axed across Australia and New Zealand | date=17 February 2020 | publisher=ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)}}</ref> It has been replaced by [[GM Specialty Vehicles]] (GMSV), which imports the [[Chevrolet Silverado]] and will also import the [[Chevrolet Corvette (C8)|Chevrolet Corvette]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.carscoops.com/2020/11/chevrolet-silverado-1500-lands-in-australia-through-gms-specialty-vehicles-division/ |title=Chevrolet Silverado Lands In Australia Through GM's Specialty Vehicles Division |last=Anderson |first=Bran |website=CarScoops |date=11 November 2020 |access-date=13 November 2020}}</ref>

From here, Holden continued to pursue the goal of producing an Australian car.

In 1960, Holden introduced its third major new model, the [[Holden FB|FB]].

In 1975, Holden introduced the compact [[Isuzu Gemini|Gemini]], the Australian version of the "[[GM T platform (RWD)|T-car]]", based on the [[Opel Kadett]] C. The Gemini was an overseas design developed jointly with Isuzu, GM's Japanese affiliate; and was powered by a 1.6-litre four-cylinder engine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_gemini_tx.htm |title=Holden Gemini TX |publisher=Unique Cars and Parts |access-date=23 August 2008}}</ref> Fast becoming a popular car, the Gemini rapidly attained sales leadership in its class, and the nameplate lived on until 1987.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_gemini_rb.htm |title=Holden Gemini RB |publisher=Unique Cars and Parts |access-date=23 August 2008}}</ref>

Holden's most popular car to date, the Commodore, was introduced in 1978 as the [[Holden Commodore (VB)|VB]].<ref>[[#Tuckey (1999)|Tuckey (1999)]], p. 27.</ref> The new family car was loosely based on the [[Opel Rekord]] E body shell, but with the front from the [[Opel Senator]] grafted to accommodate the larger Holden six-cylinder and V8 engines. Initially, the Commodore maintained Holden's sales leadership in Australia.<ref>[[#Tuckey (1999)|Tuckey (1999)]], p. 33.</ref> However, some of the compromises resulting from the adoption of a design intended for another market hampered the car's acceptance.

During the 1970s, Holden ran an advertising jingle "Football, Meat Pies, Kangaroos, and Holden cars", a localised version of the "Baseball, Hot Dogs, Apple Pies, and Chevrolet" jingle used by GM's Chevrolet division in the United States.<ref>{{cite news |last=King |first=Philip |date=16 August 2008 |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/cars-at-a-fork-in-the-road/story-e6frgafo-1111117208528 |title=Cars at a fork in the road |work=[[The Australian]] |access-date=19 November 2008}}</ref>

Holden discontinued the Torana in 1979 and the Sunbird in 1980. After the 1978 introduction of the Commodore, the Torana became the "in-between" car, surrounded by the smaller and more economical Gemini and the larger, more sophisticated Commodore.

This placed a huge financial burden on the Australian subsidiary, which was already operating at a loss at this time.]]

The 1980s were challenging for Holden and the Australian automotive industry. The Australian Government tried to revive the industry with the [[Button car plan]], which encouraged car makers to focus on producing fewer models at higher, more economical volumes, and to export cars.<ref>[[#Wright (1998)|Wright (1998)]], p. 277.</ref> The decade opened with the shut-down of the Pagewood, New South Wales production plant and introduction of the [[light commercial vehicle|light commercial]] [[Holden Rodeo|Rodeo]], sourced from Isuzu in Japan.<ref name = "milestones"/> The Rodeo was available in both two- and four-wheel drive [[chassis cab]] models with a choice of petrol and diesel powerplants.<ref>[[#Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (2007)|Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (2007)]]: Part Two, p. 82.</ref> The range was updated in 1988 with the TF series, based on the [[Isuzu TF]].<ref name = "milestones"/> Other cars sourced from Isuzu during the 1980s were the four-wheel drive [[Isuzu Bighorn|Jackaroo]] (1981), the [[Isuzu Fargo#Holden Shuttle|Shuttle]] (1982) van and the [[Isuzu Piazza|Piazza]] (1986) three-door sports hatchback.<ref>[[#Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (2007)|Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (2007)]]: Part Two, p. 87, 95.</ref> The second generation [[Holden Gemini]] from 1985 was also based on an Isuzu design, although, its manufacture was undertaken in Australia.<ref>[[#"Reborn!" (1985)|"Reborn!" (1985)]], p. 19. "We have been waiting a long time for this front wheel drive replacement for the original Gemini. The Isuzu people have not exactly been speedy signing off the development for the RB, or what has been known as the R-car...".</ref>

While GM Australia's commercial vehicle range had originally been mostly based on [[Bedford Vehicles|Bedford]] products, these had gradually been replaced by [[Isuzu]] products. This process began in the 1970s and by 1982 Holden's commercial vehicle arm no longer offered any Bedford products.<ref name="truck">{{cite magazine |magazine=TRUCK |date=May 1982 |ref=truck82 |page=36 |last=Mullett |first=Chris |title=Intertruck: Australia |location=London, UK |publisher=FF Publishing Ltd}}</ref>

The new [[Holden WB]] commercial vehicles and the [[Statesman WB]] limousines were introduced in 1980. However, the designs, based on the HQ and updated HJ, [[Holden HX|HX]] and [[Holden HZ|HZ]] models from the 1970s were less competitive than similar models in Ford's lineup. Thus, Holden abandoned those vehicle classes altogether in 1984.<ref name = "Strauss 11"/> Sales of the Commodore also fell, with the effects of the [[1979 energy crisis]] lessening, and for the first time the Commodore lost ground to the Ford Falcon. Sales in other segments also suffered when competition from Ford intensified, and other Australian manufacturers: [[Mitsubishi Motors Australia|Mitsubishi]], [[Nissan Motors|Nissan]] and [[Toyota]] gained market share.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kenwright |first=Joe |date=29 July 2006 |url=http://www.carsales.com.au/advice/2006/large-passenger/holden/commodore/crossing-the-lion-7422 |title=Crossing the Lion |publisher=[[Carsales]] |access-date=16 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309064055/http://www.carsales.com.au/advice/2006/large-passenger/holden/commodore/crossing-the-lion-7422 |archive-date=9 March 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> When released in 1982, the Camira initially generated good sales, which later declined because buyers considered the 1.6-litre engine underpowered, and the car's build and ride quality below-average.<ref name = "Robinson 24"/> The Camira lasted just seven years, and contributed to Holden's accumulated losses of over A$500&nbsp;million by the mid-1980s.<ref>[[#Robinson (2006)|Robinson (2006)]], p. 26.</ref>

Holden reintroduced its defunct Statesman title in 1990—this time under the Holden marque, as the [[Holden Caprice|Statesman and Caprice]].

Holden introduced the all-new [[Holden Commodore (VT)|VT Commodore]] in 1997, the outcome of a A$600&nbsp;million development programme that spanned more than five years.

=== 2000s ===
Holden's market surge from the 1990s reversed in the 2000s decade.

Holden caused controversy in 2005 with their Holden Employee Pricing television advertisement, which ran from October to December 2005. The campaign publicised, "for the first time ever, all Australians can enjoy the financial benefit of Holden Employee Pricing". However, this did not include a discounted dealer delivery fee and savings on factory fitted options and accessories that employees received. At the same time, employees were given a further discount of 25 to 29&nbsp;percent on selected models.<ref>{{cite web |date=19 April 2006 |url=http://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/holden-employee-pricing-backfires |title=Holden employee pricing backfires |publisher=[[Australian Competition & Consumer Commission]] |access-date=28 January 2008}}</ref>

Throughout the 1990s, Opel had also been the source of many Holden models.

Following the government grant announcement, [[Kevin Rudd]], Australia's Prime Minister at the time, stated that production would support 600 new jobs at the Elizabeth facility; however, this failed to take into account Holden's previous announcement, whereby 600 jobs would be shed when production of the ''Family II'' engine ceased in late 2009.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kerin |first=Paul |date=17 March 2009 |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/opinion/too-easy-for-gm/story-e6frg9if-1111119152290 |title=Rudd has made it too easy |work=[[The Australian]] |access-date=17 March 2009}}</ref> In mid-2013, Holden sought a further A$265&nbsp;million, in addition to the A$275&nbsp;million that was already committed by the governments of Canberra, South Australia and Victoria, to remain viable as a car manufacturer in Australia.

In March 2012, Holden was given a $270&nbsp;million lifeline by the Australian federal government along with the South Australian and Victorian state governments. In return, Holden planned to inject over $1&nbsp;billion into car manufacturing in Australia.

Holden began to export vehicles in 1954, sending the FJ to New Zealand.<ref>[[#Tuckey (2003)|Tuckey (2003)]], p. 120.</ref> Exports to New Zealand continued, but to broaden their export potential, Holden began to cater their Commodore, Monaro and Statesman/Caprice models for both right- and left-hand drive markets.
