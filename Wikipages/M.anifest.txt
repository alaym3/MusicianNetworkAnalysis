==Personal life and education==
M.anifest is the son of Ghanaian lawyer and academician [[Tsatsu Tsikata]] and Reverend Dr Priscilla Naana Nketia, a lawyer and pastor. His maternal grandfather [[Joseph Hanson Kwabena Nketia]] was a composer, professor and ethnomusicologist. M.anifest migrated to the Twin Cities (Minneapolis-St Paul, USA) in 2001 to attend [[Macalester College]], where he graduated in 2005 with a Bachelor of Arts in economics.

M.anifest went to high school at [[SOS-Hermann Gmeiner International College]] in [[Tema]]. He was the entertainment prefect of his school known as Amet Tsikata. He has had artist residencies and given lectures in [[St. Lawrence University]], [[University of Ghana]], and spoken to several classes in [[Hamline University]], [[Macalester College]] (his [[Alma mater|Alma Mater]]), Penumbra Theater's Summer Arts Institute, [[Ashesi University]].

==Career==
In his time in the Twin Cities, M.anifest learnt to adopt the do-it-yourself credo and the know-how in becoming an independent musician.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bryan |first=Beverly |url=http://www.mtviggy.com/interviews/m-anifest-sells-the-truth-in-africa/ |title=M.anifest Sells The Truth In Africa |publisher=Mtv Iggy |date=2012-09-27 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref> He released his first solo album, ''Manifestations,'' in 2007 funded by royalties he received from lending his voice to a [[Pepsi]] jingle that played nationally on U.S radio.<ref name=Vita.MN>{{cite web|last=Vita.MN|title=Best New Bands: M.anifest Destiny|url=http://www.vita.mn/story.php?id=13849676|accessdate=21 March 2012}}</ref> ''Manifestations'' earned him Songwriter of the year Honors in the City Pages<ref name=":0" /> as well as top five albums of the year recognition in the [[Star Tribune]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Rhonda Prast |url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/music/12853436.html |title='Undisputed' champ: The top local albums of '07 |publisher=Star Tribune |date=2007-12-27 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref> In 2009 he released a free album, the ''Birds and the Beats,'' to raise awareness and funds for the work of a non-profit, Young Entrepreneurs Africa.<ref>{{cite web |last=Patrin |first=Nate |url=http://blogs.citypages.com/gimmenoise/2009/11/manifests_free_album.php |title=M.anifest's free album 'The Birds & the Beats' available now &#124; City Pages |publisher=Blogs.citypages.com |date=2009-11-20 |accessdate=2014-04-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329093519/http://blogs.citypages.com/gimmenoise/2009/11/manifests_free_album.php |archivedate=2014-03-29 }}</ref>

In 2010 M.anifest linked up with Africa Express and played gigs in France and Spain with them in the same year. He caught the attention of Africa Express co-founder Damon Albarn who thereafter invited M.anifest to be a collaborator on ''[[Rocket Juice & the Moon]]'' in 2011.<ref name=":1" /> In September 2012, M.anifest joined the Africa Express train touring the UK.<ref>{{cite web|last=Toledo |first=Manuel |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19533833 |title=BBC News - The Africa Express rolls into London |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2012-09-09 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref> He wrote for ''[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]'' about these experiences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/manifest/africa-express-african-music-going-places_b_1846598.html |title=M.anifest: Africa Express: African Music Going Places |publisher=Huffingtonpost.co.uk |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref>

He released his sophomore album ''Immigrant Chronicles: Coming to America'' in September 2011, which included the singles "Suffer", "Asa" and "Blue (Chale What Dey Happen)". It marked a decade of his life in the U.S. and the beginning of his transition back to Ghana.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.okayafrica.com/stories/interview-m-anifest-returns-to-ghana/ |title=Interview: M.anifest Returns to Ghana « Okayafrica.

On 30 June 2016, M.anifest released a diss track to fellow rapper [[Sarkodie (rapper)|Sarkodie]] titled "god MC". Sarkodie replied within two days with a diss track of his own called "Kanta", which was a Panda cover. M.anifest's god MC went on to win Hip Hop Song of the year in the [[Vodafone Ghana Music Awards|Ghana Music Award]] the following year. Two years later on 24 December 2018, the two officially squashed their beef with Sarkodie performing<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sedode|first=Pilot|date=2019-12-18|title=#Manifestivities19: Check Out The Artistes Who Will Perform At The Event|url=https://kuulpeeps.com/2019/12/18/manifestivities19-check-out-the-artistes-who-will-perform-at-the-event/news|access-date=2020-10-30|website=Kuulpeeps - Ghana Campus News and Lifestyle Site by Students|language=en-US}}</ref> at M.anifest's yearly ''Manifestivies'' concert in Accra. On June 18, 2020, the two cemented their friendship with Sarkodie featuring M.anifest on his politically conscious track, ''Brown Paper Bag''. The song was met with mixed reaction, with popular music critic, Gabriel Myers Hansen, bemoaning its lack of dance rhythm.<ref name="enewsgh.com">{{Cite web|date=2020-06-22|title=#BrownPaperBag: Where Sarkodie and M.anifest Fail Us|url=https://enewsgh.com/2020/06/22/brownpaperbag-where-sarkodie-and-m-anifest-fail-us-fd/|access-date=2020-10-30|website=Proudly Ghanaian! {{!}} Enews|language=en-US}}</ref>

''"Bereft of hooks, the instrumentation of the song is crafted with chords that fend off dance; instead inducing a frightful, contemplative atmosphere complete with doomy humming and the blast of gunshots. Insofar as this facilitates the discussion it hosts, it is fit for purpose. After all, this is not a forum for the fainthearted."''<ref name="enewsgh.com"/>

=== 2016: ''god MC'' and ''Nowhere Cool'' ===
On June 30, 2016, M.anifest released "''god MC''", a diss track aimed at Sarkodie. The song was a response to Sarkodie's "''Bossy''" track on which the Tema-based rapper threw subliminal shots at many of his contemporaries. At the end of the track, Sarkodie said:

''"M.anifest meserɛ wo lemme just use your “dor dor dor ti dor” to end this verse."''

''“Dor dor dor ti dor”'' is one of M.anifest's many taglines. M.anifest said he felt disrespected with the way Sarkodie used the tagline to sign off of a track on which he had thrown shots at his colleague rappers. On ''god MC'', the Madina rapper said: ''"Go to the market, buy yourself some manners; don't use my name in vain, that's just for starters."'' Sarkodie then replied with ''Kanta'' but M.anifest never replied to that diss track. When asked about why he didn't respond, M.anifest replied that he had already said all that needed to be said. He added that his ''god MC'' track got more people talking about the content of songs than they were doing before. ''god MC'' also talked about the state of Ghana's pop culture, with the rapper bemoaning our "''move from Inspector Bediako to Kunkum Bagya''," a reference to the country's departure from creating real authentic Ghanaian productions to dubbing foreign films into local languages. Many listeners thought M.anifest had used the rap beef with Sarkodie to hype his own upcoming album, ''Nowhere Cool'' which dropped a few months later.

On July 14, 2016, M.anifest dropped another single called ''100%'' which some took as a continuation of his conflict with Sarkodie. Though he denied it, many caught the part where he said, "''You dey beef with uh, nah I'm chilling''." 100% featured [[Worlasi]] and was an instant hit. It's groovy rhythm and infectious hook was a departure from M.anifest's more thoughtful singles and elaborate verses. Despite its simplicity, M.anifest still managed to enrich his lines by using alternating antonyms in his verses. ''"I'm an expensive guy, you want cheap side/ can't strong arm me with a weak vibe/ if I decide to let the beat ride, it's a major move to over the minor dudes/Everyday some hater dey write love song..."'' Unlike most of M.anifest's songs, ''100%'' was a banger of a song that didn't require much analysis to understand. Worlasi echoed the sentiment in the bridge of the song when he said: "''Normally, some deep things/ but now, we dey ease things/ me den M.anifest 'bout to move things/ raise things y'all n-word better rethink.''"

On September 6, 2016, M.anifest dropped the ''Nowhere Cool'' album trailer on YouTube, following up with the releases of both ''B.E.A.R.'' and ''Sugar'' as lead singles. ''Nowhere Cool'' officially launched on September 8, 2020 to positive reviews. It had a rich roster of local and international artistes including Ghana's Worlasi and Cina Soul, as well as South Africa's Tumi Molekane and Nomisupasta. Dex Kwasi was tapped for ''Palm Wine & Whisky'' while Nigeria's [[Brymo]] featured on ''Sugar'' and ''Good Bye''. Paapa whom M.anifest featured on ''Right Here'' off his ''Apae: the Price of Free EP'' album, also featured on ''Ozymandias''.

The ''Nowhere Cool'' project is a conceptual album. The album opens with a titular track, ''Nowhere Cool'', which talks about the uncertainty of being a creative in Ghana. On ''Good Bye'', the album's final track, M.anifest and Brymo take turns to sing about the loss of a loved one, signified by the fact that the album is now out of their hands and in the care of their fans.

Between the two tracks, the album is filled with songs that talk about the invisible man and his struggles (''Invisible'') and the aspirations of a poor man (''Rich People Problems''). Despite the verses about human struggles, ''Nowhere Cool'' includes the promise of a brighter end, which is captured on ''Now Here Cool'', an anagram to the album title.

M.anifest has described Nowhere Cool as his best project yet. Its title came from a short story of the same name by foremost Ghanaian author and poet, Prof. Ama Ata Aidoo. On ''Now Here Cool'', she is heard reciting a piece from the same story:

''"Nowhere cool sister, ain’t nowhere cool. Therefore let me hide here among the thorns while I dine on wild desert green. And if they should ask you of me, tell them the name of the game was life, and I never learnt the rules."''<ref>{{Cite web|last=Update|first=Accra|date=2016-10-03|title=OF MODEL ALBUMS: Nowhere Cool (A Review)|url=https://myershansen.wordpress.com/2016/10/03/of-model-albums-nowhere-cool-a-review/|access-date=2020-10-30|website=Accra ent. essays {{!}} Tortoise vims {{!}} Young man, too.|language=en}}</ref>
