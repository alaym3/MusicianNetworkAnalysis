'''Jesse''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|s|i}})<ref>[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng churchofjesuschrist.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «jĕs'ē»</ref> or '''Yishai''' ({{lang-he|יִשַׁי}} – ''Yišay'',{{efn|In 1 Chronicles 2:13 only, the Hebrew name is {{Script/Hebrew|אִישַׁי}} – ''{{'}}Īšay''.}} in [[pausa]] {{Script/Hebrew|יִשָׁי}} – ''Yišāy'', meaning "King" or "God's gift"; {{lang-syr|ܐܝܫܝ}} – ''Eshai''; {{lang-el|Ἰεσσαί}} – ''Iessaí''; {{lang-la|Issai, Isai, Jesse}}), is a figure described in the [[Bible]] as the father of [[David]], who became the king of the [[Israelites]]. His son David is sometimes called simply "Son of Jesse" (''Ben Yishai''). The role as both father of King David and ancestor of Jesus has been used in various depictions in art, e.g. as the [[Tree of Jesse]] or in hymns like "[[Es ist ein Ros entsprungen|Lo, how a rose e'er blooming]]."

== Biblical background ==
===Narrative===
According to the Bible, Jesse was the son of [[Obed (Biblical figure)|Obed]] and the grandson of [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]] and of [[Boaz]]. He lived in [[Bethlehem]], in Judah, and was of the [[Tribe of Judah]], he was a [[farmer]], [[breeder]] and owner of sheep. He was a prominent resident of the town of Bethlehem.<ref>1 Samuel 16:1</ref> Jesse is important in [[Judaism]] because he was the father of the most famous King of Israel. He is important in [[Christianity]], in part because he is in the [[Old Testament]] and mentioned in the [[genealogy of Jesus]]. Later rabbinic traditions name him as one of four ancient Israelites who died without sin, the other three being [[Benjamin]], [[Chileab]] and [[Amram]].

The [[Book of Samuel]] states that Jesse had eight sons, naming the first three as Eliab, Abinadab and Shammah, and David as the youngest.<ref>{{bibleverse|1 Samuel|16:6-16:11}}</ref> The [[Book of Chronicles]] names seven sons of Jesse—Eliab, Abinadab, Shimea, Nethanel, Raddai, Ozem and David—as well as two daughters, [[Zeruiah]] and [[Abigail (mother of Amasa)|Abigail]].<ref>{{bibleverse|1 Chronicles|2:13-2:16}}</ref> Among his grandchildren were the three sons of [[Zeruiah]]: [[Abishai (Bible)|Abishai]], [[Joab]] and [[Asahel]]; and [[Amasa]], the son of Abigail.<ref>{{bibleverse|1 Chronicles|2:16-2:17}}</ref>

One day the prophet [[Samuel]] came to Bethlehem sent by God, to anoint the next king of Israel. Ostensibly, his visit to Bethlehem was to offer a sacrifice to God. He used that excuse because he was afraid that [[King Saul]] might kill him if he suspected the true reason for his arrival in Bethlehem. Samuel offered a sacrifice with Jesse and then went to his house, where he sanctified him and his family. The [[prophet]] asked Jesse to present his sons. When Samuel saw Eliab, Jesse's eldest son, he was impressed by his stature and convinced that he must be God's anointed king, however, God said to Samuel, "Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The Lord does not look at the things man looks at. Man look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart" (1 Samuel 16:7 NIV). When Jesse presented his second son, Abinadab, God told Samuel, "The Lord has not chosen this one either" (1 Samuel 16:8 NIV). This happened again with his third son, Shammah, then his fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh sons. Finally, Samuel inquired of Jesse if he had any other sons. Jesse told him that David the youngest was tending the flock. The prophet then asked for him to be brought in from tending the sheep. Samuel waited, and when he arrived [[God]] asked the prophet to anoint David as king over [[Israel]] (1 Samuel 16:13).

Some time later, Saul, suffering from depression and melancholy, asked Jesse for his son David to play the harp for him, since he had heard that David played the harp beautifully. Jesse sent his son along with some gifts for the King. The King was so taken with David's harp playing that he asked Jesse to keep him in his court to play for him whenever he was depressed. Later on Jesse sent his son David with gifts to be given to his older brothers who were to fight in the war against the [[Philistines]] in Saul's army. Years later David fled to the desert away from Saul, who sought to kill David in order for him to stay in power and not have his throne be taken away from him. David, worried about the safety of his parents, went to [[Mizpah (Moab)|Mizpah]] in [[Moab]], to ask permission from the King to allow his father Jesse and his mother to stay under the royal protection of the King. They stayed there until David's fortunes took a turn for the better.

===In prophecy===
[[File:John in Korovniki church - prophet 01 Jesse (c. 1654, Yaroslavl).jpg|thumbnail|Russian icon]]
The name ''Jesse'' is referenced in the Old Testament, and in particular the passages of [[Isaiah]], Chapter 11, Verses 1–3:
 
{{Quote| 1. And there shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots. 2. And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord. 3. And his delight shall be in the fear of the Lord. He shall not judge by what his eyes see, or decide by what his ears hear;<ref name="I Ch 11">Isaiah, Chapter 11. ''The Holy Bible'', Revised Standard Version.</ref>}}
Also Chapter 11, Verse 10: {{quote| 10. In that day the root of Jesse shall stand as an ensign to the peoples; him shall the nations seek, and his dwellings shall be glorious.<ref name="I Ch 11" />}}

These are two of the verses regarded by Christians as prophecy of the [[advent]] of Jesus, whom they consider to be the [[Christ]] and [[Messiah]]. These two prophecies are regarded by Bahá'ís as referring to [[Bahá'u'lláh]], alleged to also have arisen from "the stump of Jesse".<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Harvnb|Balyuzi|2000|pp=9–12}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Effendi|1944|p=94}}</ref> These prophecies are also regarded in Latter-Day Saint Movement about the coming [[Root of Jesse]], an ensign who holds special priesthood keys and a gathering of the Lord's people.<ref>[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/113.5-6?lang=eng Doctrine and Covenants Section 113 verses 5-6]</ref>

== Tomb of Jesse ==

[[File:YSHAI747.JPG|thumb|Tomb of Jesse and Ruth in Hebron.]]
The Tomb of Ruth and Jesse is an old stone structure on a hilltop in Hebron which today serves as a synagogue.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}  It receives numerous visitors every year, especially on the Jewish holiday of Shavuot when the Book of Ruth is read.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Converts pay homage to Ruth at her Hebron tomb|url = http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/Converts-pay-homage-to-Ruth-at-her-Hebron-tomb|website = The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com|access-date = 2016-01-28}}</ref> The 1537 book ''Yihus HaAvos V'Neviim (Lineage of the Patriarch and the Prophets)'' describes the tomb as "a handsome building up on the mount, where Jesse, the King David's father is buried." It includes a drawing of the site, and notes an "ancient Israelite burial ground" nearby and Crusader courtyard. Rabbi Moshe Basola wrote in his travel journal<ref>{{Cite book|title = In Zion and Jerusalem: the itinerary of Rabbi Moses Basola (1521-1523)|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6XRtAAAAMAAJ|publisher = C.
