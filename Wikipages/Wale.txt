A '''wale''' is one of the [[Strake|strakes]] of [[Plank (wood)|wooden planking]] that forms the outer skin of the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] of a [[ship]], but substantially thicker than the other strakes. It provides extra stiffening and strength to the hull. It was a common feature of heavy wooden ship construction, particularly from mediaeval times to the early years of the 19th century, being a major constructional component of ships like {{USS|Constitution}}, {{HMS|Victory}} and many earlier vessels.<ref name="Ball and Simon 2018">{{cite book |last1=Ball |first1=Nick |last2=Stephens |first2=Simon |title=Navy Board Ship Models |date=2018 |chapter= Glossary|publisher=Seaforth Publishing |location=Barnsley |isbn=978-1-5267-0111-4}}</ref><ref name="Steffy 1994">{{cite book |last=Steffy |first=J.

A wale (or "waler") is a horizontal supporting member of a concrete forming system, vertically reinforced by a "strongback".

A wale is also a horizontal member of a geotechnical [[Tieback (geotechnical)|tieback]] wall, which transmits the force from the tieback to the beams.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}{{Clarify|date=October 2013}}
