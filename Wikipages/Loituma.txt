'''Loituma''' is a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[quartet]] whose members combine the Finnish vocal tradition with the sounds of the [[kantele]]. Loituma were selected Ensemble of the Year at the 1997 [[Kaustinen Folk Music Festival]].

==History==
Loituma’s initial incarnation was in the autumn of 1989 as a septet called ''Jäykkä Leipä'' ("Stiff Bread"), born in the [[Sibelius Academy]]’s Folk music department. The original lineup included singers [[Sanna Kurki-Suonio]] and [[Tellu Turkka|Tellu Paulasto]], who later left for [[Sweden]] to join [[Hedningarna]].

Over the years, the group has persistently followed its own musical path, incorporating diverse influences into its music. One of the cornerstones of Finnish [[folk music]] is the art of singing, through which the stories and feelings which comprise aspects of the Finnish heritage are conveyed, aided by backing musicians Martti Pokela and Toivo Alaspää. Another cornerstone of Loituma's art is a Finnish folk instrument called the [[kantele]], which is featured in varied ways in their recordings.

Loituma members compose or arrange the tunes themselves, but often use [[improvisation]]. Lyrics come from many sources, including two main traditional sources: the [[Kalevala]], the national epic of Finland; and the [[Kanteletar]] ([[Elias Lönnrot|Lönnrot]]'s collection of Finnish folk poetry). The lyrics are in [[Finnish language|Finnish]].
