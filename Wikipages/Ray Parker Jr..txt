==Career==
===Early work===
Parker gained recognition during the late 1960s as a member of [[Hamilton Bohannon|Bohannon]]'s house band at the [[The 20 Grand|20 Grand]] nightclub.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> This Detroit hotspot often featured Tamla/[[Motown]] acts, one of which, the (Detroit) [[The Spinners (American R&B group)|Spinners]], was so impressed by the young guitarist's skills that they added him to their touring group.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Through the Bohannon relationship, he recorded and co-wrote his first songs at age 16 with [[Marvin Gaye]]. Parker was also employed as a studio musician as a teenager for the emergent [[Holland-Dozier-Holland]]'s [[Invictus Records|Invictus]]/[[Hot Wax Records|Hot Wax]] stable, and his 'choppy' style was especially prominent on "[[Want Ads]]", a number one single for [[Honey Cone]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Parker was later enlisted by [[Lamont Dozier]] to appear on his first two albums for [[ABC Records]].

In 1972, Parker was a guest guitarist on [[Stevie Wonder]]'s funk song "Maybe Your Baby", from Wonder's album ''[[Talking Book]]'', an association which prompted a permanent move to Los Angeles.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> He also was the lead guitarist for Wonder when Wonder served as the opening act on the [[Rolling Stones]]' 1972 tour.<ref>''[[American Top 40]]'', February 18, 1978</ref> In 1973, he became a [[session musician|sideman]] in [[Barry White]]'s [[The Love Unlimited Orchestra|Love Unlimited Orchestra]]. Parker appeared briefly in the 1974 film ''[[Uptown Saturday Night]]'' as a guitar player in the church picnic scene.

Parker also wrote songs and did session work for [[the Carpenters]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[Rufus (band)|Rufus]] and [[Chaka Khan]], [[the Supremes]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Bill Withers]], [[Michael Henderson]], [[Jean-Luc Ponty]], [[Leon Haywood]], [[the Temptations]], [[Boz Scaggs]], [[David Foster]], [[Rhythm Heritage]], [[Gladys Knight & the Pips]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Tina Turner]], and [[Diana Ross]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The single hit No. 1 on the R&B charts and No. 11 on the pop charts in December 1974. In 1976, he featured as rhythm guitarist on [[Lucio Battisti]]'s album ''[[Io tu noi tutti]]'', translated as "Me you and all of us".{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===1977–1981: Raydio===
In 1977, Parker created the [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] group [[Raydio]] with Vincent Bonham, Jerry Knight, and Arnell Carmichael.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Raydio scored their first big hit with "[[Jack And Jill (Raydio song)|Jack and Jill]]", from their 1978 [[Raydio (album)|self-titled album]] with [[Arista Records]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/> The song reached No. 8 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, earning a Gold single and Gold album in the process. Their follow-up hit, "You Can't Change That", was released in 1979 from the ''[[Rock On (Raydio album)|Rock On]]'' album. The song was another Top 10 hit, peaking at No. 9 on the ''Billboard'' chart during the summer and selling a million copies.

In 1980, the group became known as Ray Parker Jr. and Raydio.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> The group released two more albums: ''Two Places at the Same Time'' in 1980 and ''A Woman Needs Love'' in 1981, both Gold albums. In 1981, Parker produced the hard funk single "Sweat (Till You Get Wet)" by [[Brick (band)|Brick]]. During the 1980s, Ray Parker Jr. and Raydio had two Top 40 hits: "Two Places at the Same Time" (No. 30 in 1980) and "That Old Song" (No. 21 in 1981). Their last and biggest hit, "[[A Woman Needs Love (Just Like You Do)]]", released in 1981,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> went to No. 4 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and to No. 1 on the R&B Chart for two weeks that year.

===Solo years===
Raydio broke up in 1981. Parker continued with his solo career, scoring eight Top 40 hits, including the hit single "[[The Other Woman (Ray Parker Jr. song)|The Other Woman]]" (Pop No. 4) in 1982 and "[[Ghostbusters (song)|Ghostbusters]]" in 1984.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> "Ghostbusters" peaked at No. 1 for three weeks on ''Billboard'''s Hot 100 chart, and at No. 1 for two weeks on its Black Singles chart. The song was also nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for Best Original Song in 1984, but lost to Stevie Wonder's "[[I Just Called to Say I Love You]]" from ''[[The Woman in Red (1984 film)|The Woman in Red]]''. Parker's song secured him a 1984 Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance.<ref>{{cite web|title=Classic Tracks: Ray Parker Jr.'s "Ghostbusters"|url=http://mixonline.com/recording/interviews/audio_ray_parker_jrs/|publisher=Mixonline.com|access-date=2 August 2012|author=Blair Jackson|date=Sep 1, 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015711/http://mixonline.com/recording/interviews/audio_ray_parker_jrs/|archive-date=30 September 2007}}</ref> Other hits from this period included "[[I Still Can't Get Over Loving You]]" (Pop No. 12) and "Jamie" (Pop No. 14).

====''Ghostbusters'' theme song lawsuit====
In 1984, [[Huey Lewis]] sued Columbia Pictures and Parker, stating that the melody to the ''Ghostbusters'' theme song infringed on the copyright of the [[Huey Lewis and the News]] song "[[I Want a New Drug]]", which had been released on their album ''[[Sports (Huey Lewis and the News album)|Sports]]'' the previous year. The three parties reached a settlement in 1995 which forbade them from revealing any information that was not included in a press release they jointly issued at the time. In March 2001, Parker filed a suit against Lewis for breaching the part of the settlement which [[Non-disclosure agreement|prohibited either side from speaking about it publicly]].<ref>Vanhorn, Teri (March 23, 2001). [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1442126/20010323/lewis_huey.jhtml "Ray Parker Jr. Suing Huey Lewis Over 'Ghostbusters' Comment"]. [[MTV]].</ref>

==Music videos==
Parker was one of the first black artists to venture into the then-fledgling world of [[music videos]]. In 1978, Hollywood producer Thom Eubank produced several music videos of songs from Raydio's first, eponymous album on Arista Records. The single "Jack & Jill" was the first released to air on [[Wolfman Jack]]'s Saturday night television show, ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]''. The music videos were also transferred to film and projected in movie theaters all over Europe. He also made two different videos for his hit "The Other Woman". The first was [[Halloween]]-themed and centered around a haunted castle with dancing corpses and [[vampire]]s. The second was more performance-oriented, with Parker performing the song against an outer space background with backup singers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Parker's "Ghostbusters" video, helmed by the film's director, [[Ivan Reitman]], was one of the first movie-themed videos to find success on [[MTV]].

==Acting==
In addition to ''Uptown Saturday Night'', Parker also made acting appearances on the 1980s sitcom ''[[Gimme a Break]]'', 1984 [[CBS]] Saturday morning kids' show ''[[Pryor's Place]]'' (for which Parker appeared in the opening title sequence singing the theme song), two episodes of ''[[Berrenger's]]'' (1985), ''Charlie Barnett's Terms of Enrollment'' (1986) (V) aka ''Terms of Enrollment ''(USA: short title), ''[[Disorderlies]]'' (1987), ''[[Enemy Territory (film)|Enemy Territory]]'' (1987).  He was also a production assistant for the film ''Fly by Night'' (1993). He made guest appearances on ''[[21 Jump Street]]'' and ''[[Kids Incorporated]]''. In early 2009, Parker appeared in a television advertisement for [[118 118 (UK)|118 118]], a British [[directory enquiries]] provider. This featured Parker singing a 118-specific version of the ''Ghostbusters'' theme song.<ref>{{YouTube|LZw87CSV-o4|118 television commercial}}</ref><!--Original version, not a copyvio-->

On April 15, 2009, Parker's 118 theme song was made available as a downloadable ringtone from the 118 118 mobile website. In 2014, Parker appeared in the fifth episode of the first season of [[NBC]]'s romantic comedy television series ''[[A to Z (TV series)|A to Z]]'', singing the "Ghostbusters" theme song for a Halloween party. Parker was highlighted on [[TV One (U.S. TV network)|TV One]]'s series, ''[[Unsung (TV series)|Unsung]]'', in the fifth season.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Personal life==
