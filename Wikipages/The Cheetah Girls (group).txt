===2002–2005: ''The Cheetah Girls'' film, breakthrough and ''Cheetah-licious Christmas''===
[[File:Cheetahliciouschristmasconcert.jpg|thumb|right|The Cheetah Girls performing during their Christmas tour in 2005]]
The Cheetah Girls had a television movie, based on a best-selling series of young adult books of the same name by Deborah Gregory, which was filmed in October and November 2002, and debuted on August 15, 2003.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibtimes.com/how-cheetah-girls-paved-way-disney-channels-future-musical-movies-2708796|title=How 'Cheetah Girls' Paved The Way For Disney Channel's Future Musical Movies|date=2018-08-15|website=International Business Times|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref> The movie's DVD sold over 800,000 copies and the film received over 84 million viewers worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gazettereview.com/2017/03/raven-symone-net-worth/|title=Raven Symone Net Worth 2018 - How Rich Is She Now?|last=Carter|first=Brooke|date=2017-03-31|website=Gazette Review|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref> The film starred Raven-Symoné, Sabrina Byran, Adrienne Bailon and Kiely Williams. During casting auditions for the film, the singer [[Solange Knowles]] was originally cast, but pulled out of the film due to the promotion and release of her debut album ''[[Solo Star]]''. The role was then given to Williams, who along with Bailon was originally in the girl group [[3LW]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibtimes.com/cheetah-girls-almost-starred-solange-knowles-main-character-2720651|last=Ellenbogen |first=Rachael|title='The Cheetah Girls' Almost Starred Solange Knowles As This Main Character|website=[[International Business Times]]|date=September 27, 2018|access-date=2020-08-04}}</ref> Though there had been no contractual plans to record as an actual music group, producer [[Debra Martin Chase]] was able to convince Disney to create new contracts and release the film's music as a soundtrack. The CD was a surprise success despite not having been promoted.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibtimes.com/how-cheetah-girls-paved-way-disney-channels-future-musical-movies-2708796|title=How 'Cheetah Girls' Paved The Way For Disney Channel's Future Musical Movies|date=2018-08-15|website=International Business Times|access-date=2019-02-27}}</ref> Soon after the first soundtrack, plans were underway to turn the Cheetah Girls into a real-life recording group. Symoné however, decided to focus on solo work, leaving the trio of just Bailon, Bryan and Williams.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-cheetah-girls-mn0000762663/biography|title=The Cheetah Girls {{!}} Biography & History|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref>

The Cheetah Girls was also supposed to be adapted into a primetime TV series for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in their 2004–2005 season. According to an article on the [[MTV]] news site, ABC was set to put the show into production in early 2004, with discussions also being held to write a role for fellow 3LW member, Jessica Benson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1480888/3lw-bringing-cheetah-girls-to-tv-may-get-real-in-atlanta/|title=3LW Bringing 'Cheetah Girls' To TV, May Get Real In Atlanta|last=Archive-Corey-Moss|website=MTV News|access-date=2019-03-05}}</ref> A later article, published in February 2004,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Glaeser|first1=Edward|last2=Gyourko|first2=Joseph|last3=Saks|first3=Raven|date=November 2003|title=Why is Manhattan So Expensive?

The article stated that because of this success, Raven would not be able to do the sitcom. ABC did not pick up the series. A pilot for the show was rumored to have been filmed, but the long-standing rumors about the pilot being filmed were later debunked by Williams and Bryan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ibtimes.com/long-standing-cheetah-girls-rumor-debunked-stars-sabrina-bryan-kiely-williams-2813999|title=Long-Standing 'Cheetah Girls' Rumor Debunked By Stars Sabrina Bryan, Kiely Williams|website=[[International Business Times]]|date=2019-08-15|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref>

In late 2004, the girls recorded for the first time as a trio and recording act for the ''[[Disneymania 3]]'' album, remaking the song "[[I Won't Say (I'm in Love)]]" from the ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'' soundtrack.

The girls released their first recording in October 2005 under [[Walt Disney Records]], ''[[Cheetah-licious Christmas]]'', the holiday album included classic Christmas songs, as well as several original songs, one of which was co-written by all three girls. The album peaked at number 74 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart. The lead single, "[[Cheetah-licious Christmas (song)|Cheetah-licious Christmas]]", was rotated on [[Radio Disney]] and a music video for the song was shown on [[Disney Channel]]. A second single from the album, "Five More Days 'Til Christmas" was released as a promo single exclusively on [[Radio Disney]]. The following month, the girls went on their very first tour to support the album, along with [[Aly & AJ]] as the opening act and the [[Jonas Brothers]] as special guests.

===2006–2007:''The Cheetah Girls 2'' and ''TCG''===
The Cheetah Girls began work on their debut album in January 2006. "We'll be making a real album, not a soundtrack," [[Adrienne Bailon]] says. "Some of the music on there will be produced by [[will.i.am]] from [[The Black Eyed Peas]]," she says. "It's important for people to see us as a real musical group. We have all this great marketing around us, with the movies and other things. But we are a musical group." However, when filming and recording for ''[[The Cheetah Girls 2]]'' came up, the album was put on hold. Raven-Symoné returned for the film, which was shot on location in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]] in the spring of 2006.

''[[The Cheetah Girls 2 (soundtrack)|The Cheetah Girls 2]]'' premiere received a total of over 8.1 million viewers, making it the highest rated premiere for a [[Disney Channel Original Movie]] at the time. Following the film's premiere, the group embarked on [[The Party's Just Begun Tour]] from September 2006 to March 2007. They also performed at the [[Disney Channel Games]] on April 24, 2007.

In an interview with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' about the postponed album, Sabrina Bryan stated that the girls worked on writing for the album during their tour, and that they hoped to gather an audience of older fans while simultaneously staying true to their younger fan base.<ref name=billboard>[https://billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003316020 Sabrina Bryan Interview]. ''Billboard''.</ref> Bryan also stated that the girls would work with producers they had worked with in the past as well as exploring new producers, such as [[Timbaland]].<ref name=billboard/>

The album was originally titled ''Who We Are'',<ref>[https://archive.today/20070804171506/http://www.cybertlcforums.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=1016421 Adrienne in Hip-Hop Weekly]</ref> and set to be released on June 19, 2007<ref name=tommy>[http://www.tommy2.net www.tommy2.net]. www.tommy2.net.</ref> but this was postponed to September 25, 2007, with a release name of ''[[TCG (album)|TCG]]''. The track "So Bring It On" was released as the album's first single. "[[Fuego (The Cheetah Girls song)|Fuego]]" was released as the second single from the album.

===2007–2008: ''The Cheetah Girls: One World'' and disbandment===
[[File:The-Cheetah-Girls 2009-11.jpg|thumb|left|The Cheetah Girls performing at [[The Magnificent Mile]] in 2008]]
The third Cheetah Girls film was announced for pre-production in early 2007, with Adrienne Bailon revealing in March 2007 that the film would be filming for a three-month period, in India and that the film would have a storyline and theme centered around [[Bollywood]].<ref name= "robinsons">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ai54C7F92MM Adrienne Bailon at the Meet The Robinson's premiere]</ref> The entirety of the main cast members was invited to return, but Raven-Symoné confirmed in August 2007 that she would not appear in the third film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalledger.com/pop-culture-news/raven-symone-out-of-cheetah-gi-221814.shtml|title=Raven Symone Out of Cheetah Girls' Third Movie Installment|website=National Ledger|date=August 6, 2007}}</ref> 

Although "catfights" and "territorial issues" were initially stated to be the reason, Symoné revealed that she did not appear in the third film due to feeling "excluded" and "ostracized" on the set of the second film, likely due to the fact that the three other girls had spent so much time together after being put together in the real-life Cheetah Girls recording group. It was also revealed that Raven and Williams didn't get along because of jealousy of Raven's role on [[The Cosby Show]] and Raven revealed she would've went to jail if it wasn't for the actress who played her mom who had to keep her tame during filming.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/a32108298/the-cheetah-girls-drama-feud-raven-symone-kiely-williams-instagram-live-reunion-talk/|title=Raven-Symoné and Kiely Williams Just Revealed Some Major Cheetah Girls Tea on Instagram Live|website=[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]|date=April 10, 2020}}</ref> 

The group began filming their third and final ''Cheetah Girls'' movie, entitled ''[[The Cheetah Girls: One World]]'', in January 2008. It premiered on August 22, 2008 with its soundtrack released on August 19. The movie debuted with 6.2 million viewers, the lowest-ever rated premiere for the series. In the fall of 2008, the group went on tour to support the ''One World'' movie and soundtrack, which would be their last tour together. In late December 2008, the group disbanded due to being phased out for other new Disney franchises.

===Aftermath===
Since the disbandment, all four members have continued to work on various solo projects. Bryan released a book titled ''[[Princess of Gossip]]'' in 2009, had a small supporting role in the straight-to-DVD film ''[[Mostly Ghostly: Who Let the Ghosts Out?|Mostly Ghostly]]'', released another fitness DVD called ''Byou 2'', and had a part in the indie film ''If It Ain't Broke, Break It''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0117009/|title=Sabrina Bryan|access-date=September 9, 2016}}</ref> 

Raven continued to pursue her solo music career and has starred in films such as ''[[College Road Trip]]'', [[Dr. Dolittle (1998 film)|Dr Dolittle]], [[Dr. Dolittle 2|''Dr Dolittle 2'']], ''[[For One Night]]'' and ''[[Revenge of the Bridesmaids|Revenge of The Bridesmaids]]'' and voicing Iridessa in the Tinker Bell Movies as well as starring in ''[[State of Georgia (TV series)|State of Georgia]]'', guest starring on ''[[Sonny with a Chance]]'' alongside [[Demi Lovato]] and in other series such as ''[[Black-ish]]'', ''[[K.C. Undercover]]'' and ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]''. In 2015 she became a co-host on ''[[The View (talk show)|The View]]'' until the end of 2016 when she left the show to star in and executive produce the ''[[That's So Raven]]'' spinoff ''[[Raven's Home]]'' which is currently on its fourth season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/raven-symone-disney-channel-spinoff-thats-so-raven|title=Raven-Symoné Is Returning to Disney Channel For a "That's So Raven" Spinoff|last=Nast|first=Condé|website=Teen Vogue|language=en|access-date=2019-08-27}}</ref> In 2019 she appeared alongside Bailon as a contestant on the second season of [[The Masked Singer (American season 2)|The Masked Singer]] as the 'Black Widow' and 'Flamingo' respectively.

Williams played a supporting role in the film ''[[The House Bunny]]'' starring [[Anna Faris]].

== Culture ==
The Cheetah Girls were the first multi-ethnic girl music group to come out of [[Disney Channel]]. The group not only featured young women of various races, backgrounds, and sizes, but it also showcased music from various cultures around the world. When the second movie took the group to Spain, they released “[[Amigas Cheetahs]]” and “[[Fuego (The Cheetah Girls song)|Fuego]]” that featured Spanish lyrics and utilized costumes that are typical of Spanish culture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.today.com/popculture/raven-symone-takes-cheetah-girls-spain-wbna14454620|title=Raven-Symone takes 'Cheetah Girls' to Spain|website=TODAY.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-11}}</ref>

The group was largely popular at the same time as a more “grown up” multi-ethnic girl group, [[The Pussycat Dolls]]. This parallel is visible in their names, in their upbeat dance tracks, and even in their choreography. The largest difference is in the PG nature of The Cheetah Girls, they keep their choreography rather clean and they are always in layers that are not very revealing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=BICKFORD|first=TYLER|date=2012|title=The new 'tween' music industry: The Disney Channel, Kidz Bop and an emerging childhood counterpublic|journal=Popular Music|volume=31|issue=3|pages=417–436|issn=0261-1430|jstor=23325786|doi=10.1017/S0261143012000335|s2cid=162705688}}</ref> This all helped the group gain popularity with tweens and parents alike.

The message in The Cheetah Girls films is that stardom is attainable as long as you remember that your close personal relationships are more important.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2008/aug/22/entertainment/et-cheetahgirls22|title=Cheated by 'Cheetah Girls'|last=McNamara|first=Mary|date=2008-08-22|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2019-03-11|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> The group staying together was always the main goal of the series. This female support shown in the movies communicated an idea of [[feminism]] to young girls watching.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/why-the-cheetah-girls-was-the-perfect-introduction-to-intersectional-feminism-for-90s-kids-59855|title='The Cheetah Girls' Was A Primer For Intersectional Feminism|last=Decaille|first=Nia|website=Bustle|language=en|access-date=2019-03-11}}</ref> The music of the group speaks about “friends for life” and “sisters, we stand together” which gave young girls a foundation in feminism and an appreciation for other ethnicities.

The Cheetah Girls have inspired many artists that came after them.

The Cheetah Girls also sang songs from the [[The Cheetah Girls (soundtrack)|first ''Cheetah Girls'' soundtrack]], their song "[[I Won't Say (I'm in Love)]]" (from ''[[Disneymania 3]]''), and their version of "[[Shake a Tail Feather]]" (from the ''[[Chicken Little (soundtrack)|Chicken Little]]'' soundtrack).

;The Party's Just Begun Tour (2006–07)
In July 2006, the girls stated to Disney 365, a brief Disney Channel So Hot Summer news program, that they would be hitting the road again in September 2006, however they didn't state whether or not Raven-Symoné would be joining them. However, in a later interview they confirmed that Raven would not be going with them. An ad inside of the ''Cheetah Girls 2'' soundtrack confirmed the name of the tour to be The Party's Just Begun Tour. The concert was released to a live CD and DVD combo on July 10, 2007. The opening acts for the tour were [[Miley Cyrus]] (as [[Miley Stewart|Hannah Montana]]) for the first 20 dates, [[Vanessa Hudgens]] for the next 20 dates, and [[Everlife]] for the last 40 dates. [[Jordan Pruitt]] was also a special guest on the tour for the first 40 cities. Preteen group T-Squad also performed as special guests for 5 of the 58 dates. The concert tour sold out every date. For the tour's finale the group performed in Reliant Stadium in [[Houston, Texas]] with Miley Cyrus as their opening act. Within 3 minutes, the concert had already sold 80,000 tickets.

;The One World Tour (2008)
The girls announced their third tour in the summer of 2008. The tour, entitled the ''One World Tour'' began in October 2008 and is in support of the trio's third soundtrack from their [[Disney Channel]] film ''[[The Cheetah Girls: One World (soundtrack)|The Cheetah Girls: One World]]''. Bailon stated in an interview that it was likely that this tour would travel to various other countries as well as the United States and Canada. [[Corbin Bleu]] was originally announced as the opening act for the tour but due to his busy schedule could not continue with the duties. The [[Clique Girlz]] were announced as the official opening act for the tour just days before it began.
