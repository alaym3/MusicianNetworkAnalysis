==Biography==
Joseph received his undergraduate education from the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He went on to receive his [[master's degree]] from the [[New College of California]] in 1994 and his [[Psy.D]] from the [[California School of Professional Psychology]] in 2000. He received his license to practice psychology in [[California]] in 2003.<ref name=practice/> In 2014 he published ''The Trouble with Twin Studies'', which argued that research based on twin studies was highly flawed and could not be used to prove heritability of traits, as they fail to adequately control for environmental factors, as well as accusations of ethics violations in research practices.<ref>Joseph, Jay. ''The trouble with twin studies: A reassessment of twin research in the social and behavioural sciences''. Routledge, 2014.</ref> The book was negatively reviewed by psychologist [[Eric Turkheimer]], who argued twin study research was valid.<ref>Turkheimer, Eric. "Arsonists at the Cathedral." PsycCRITIQUES 60, no. 40.</ref>
