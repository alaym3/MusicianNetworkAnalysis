==Overview==
Most episodes begin with a [[cold open]] in the form of a flashback to Shawn and Gus's childhoods. The flashbacks usually involve Shawn and Gus being taught a lesson by a young Henry Spencer (Shawn's father) ([[Corbin Bernsen]]), who wishes that his son would follow in his footsteps and become a law enforcement officer. These lessons often play a role for the climax of the episode. As a child, Shawn was taught by Henry to hone his powers of observation and deduction, often using games and challenges to test him. Each flashback also sets the theme for the episode.

Shawn originally becomes known as a psychic when, after calling in tips on dozens of crimes covered on the news which help the police to close the case, the police become suspicious of his knowledge. The police theorize that such knowledge could only come from the "inside" and they decide to arrest him as a suspect. To avoid being sent to jail, Shawn uses his observational skills to convince the police that he is psychic. The interim police chief warns Shawn that if his "powers" are fake, he will be prosecuted. With no choice but to keep up the act, and having proven himself an effective aid to the police in solving crimes, he establishes a [[psychic detective]] agency, Psych, and becomes an outside consultant to the police. Pretending to have psychic powers allows him to engage in strange and comic behavior as he turns real clues into hunches and otherworldly visitations. He enjoys teasing lifelong friend Burton Guster (Gus), a pharmaceutical sales representative, about Gus's eclectic interests as they drive around in a blue [[Toyota Echo]] nicknamed "The Blueberry"<ref>{{cite web|last=Barrett |first=Annie |url=https://ew.com/article/2010/07/21/psych-dule-hill-reader-questions/ |title='Psych': Dul√© Hill answers your questions, Part 1|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=July 21, 2010 |access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> solving crimes.

Head detective Carlton Lassiter ([[Timothy Omundson]]), playfully nicknamed "Lassie" by Shawn and Gus, quietly respects Shawn's crime-solving skills, but doubts his psychic abilities and is constantly exasperated and/or infuriated by his antics. However, junior detective Juliet "Jules" O'Hara ([[Maggie Lawson]]) and Chief Vick ([[Kirsten Nelson]]) are far less antagonistic&nbsp;‚Äì with O'Hara expressing belief in Shawn's abilities, while Vick is mum on the subject&nbsp;‚Äì and usually willing to give Shawn the leeway he needs to solve cases. Henry and Shawn have a difficult relationship, but despite this, Henry reluctantly helps Shawn on various occasions.

==Episodes==

{{:List of Psych episodes}}

==Production==
The show uses [[White Rock, British Columbia|White Rock]], British Columbia, Canada for its Santa Barbara, California setting.<ref>{{cite web|title=Filming locations for "Psych" (2006)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0491738/locations|work=imdb.com|access-date=2010-07-05}}</ref> ''Psych'' also incorporates [[Vancouver]] and various locations around the [[Lower Mainland]] of British Columbia as a backdrop. Santa Barbara is on a mountainous coastline without bays and just has the few [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]] miles offshore. Many of the overlooking helicopter shots and set-up shots (in which the exterior of the Santa Barbara Courthouse is shown) are actually filmed in Santa Barbara. The animated segments "The Big Adventures of Little Shawn and Gus" were created by J.J. Sedelmaier Productions, Inc. The music, effects, and sound design for "The Big Adventures of Little Shawn and Gus" were created by Fred Weinberg.

===Theme song===
The theme song for ''Psych'' is "I Know You Know" by The Friendly Indians, series creator [[Steve Franks]]'s band. Some episodes in seasons three through eight use an extended version of "I Know You Know" consisting of the first verse and the chorus,<ref>A later version of the song performed by The Friendly Indians revealed a second verse that was not used at any point during the course of the show.</ref> but most episodes use a shortened version consisting of mostly the chorus. In some episodes, the theme song is changed, usually as a tie-in to the theme of the episode to come.

====Variations====
* The theme was given a Christmas theme for the episode "Gus's Dad May Have Killed an Old Guy". It was used again in "Christmas Joy" (3.09) and "[[The Polarizing Express]]".
* The song was sung in Spanish for "[[Lights, Camera... Homicidio]]" and "No Country for Two Old Men".
* It was expanded into a [[Bollywood]]-themed version sung in [[Hindi]] in "Bollywood Homicide" while each of the theme credits was shown first in Hindi, then in English.
* [[Boyz II Men]] performed an ''[[a cappella]]'' version of the theme for "High Top Fade Out". It was used again for the episode "[[Let's Doo-Wop It Again]]".
* In  "Romeo and Juliet and Juliet", the main titles are translated in Chinese. However, the actual theme song is not edited.
* Curt Smith of Tears for Fears guest-starred in "Shawn 2.0"  and recorded his own version of the theme. Smith also recorded a song ("This is Christmas") for the episode "The Polarizing Express".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usanetwork.com/series/psych/downloads/curtsmith.html |title=Psych TV Series ‚Äì Curt Smith ‚Äì This is Christmas |publisher=Usanetwork.com |date=December 16, 2010 |access-date=2011-08-07}}</ref>
* [[Julee Cruise]], who recorded the theme for ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', recorded a slower, extended version of the theme for the ''Twin Peaks''-inspired episode "[[Dual Spires]]".
* A superhero-themed version was recorded for "[[The Amazing Psych-Man & Tap Man|The Amazing Psych-Man & Tap Man, Issue #2]]". The main titles were also redone in a comic-book style.
* For the episode "[[Heeeeere's Lassie]]", the song and main titles were given a theme similar to ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''.
The Christmas-themed and Hindi versions of the song also include variations on the main titles. The Hindi and Chinese-themed episodes phonetically translated words into Devanagari and Chinese characters, respectively, in their title sequences. The title sequence in the episode "Dual Spires" is an almost shot-for-shot recreation of the title sequence of ''Twin Peaks''. The episode "[[100 Clues]]" featured an entirely new main title sequence based on the board game [[Clue (game)|Clue]]. The actor names and title were shown on game cards similar to those of the cards of suspects in Clue.

===Pineapple===
In the episode "[[Pilot (Psych episode)|Pilot]]", James improvised by picking up a [[pineapple]] and saying, "Should I slice this up for the road?" Since then, pineapples have appeared in every episode as a running gag, whether just one in the background or the actual mention of it. It is Shawn's go-to housewarming gift. The pineapple is a major marketing point for items related to the show on the USA website.<ref>{{cite web|title=Comedy Television Series and Mystery TV Show ‚Äì Psych TV Series ‚Äì USA Network ‚Äì What's with the Pineapple? ‚Äì USA Network|url=http://www.usanetwork.com/series/psych/pineapple/|access-date=2011-10-24}}</ref> Fan movements, such as fan-made websites, have also been dedicated to finding a pineapple or pineapple-related object in each episode.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://psychpineapple.com/|title=Psych Pineapple &#124; where is the pineapple in every episode of Psych?}}</ref>

==="Psych: The Musical"===
{{main|Psych: The Musical}}
Before season 8 was aired, the show did a special, 88-minute [[Psych: The Musical|musical episode]]. This episode does not fit chronologically in the narrative; there are situations in the episode that would imply that it takes place sometime before the middle of season 7.

===Series finale aftershow===
Following the series finale on March 26, 2014, USA Network aired a live [[aftershow]] entitled "Psych After Pshow." The hour-long special was hosted by [[Kevin Pereira]] and featured series stars and creator/executive producer Steve Franks.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140322053314/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/03/21/psych-series-finale-airs-next-week-on-usa/246920/ 'Psych' Series Finale Airs Next Week on USA]</ref>
