'''Jason Robert Brown''' (born June 20, 1970) is an American [[musical theatre]] [[composer]], [[lyricist]], and [[playwright]]. Brown's music sensibility fuses pop-rock stylings with theatrical lyrics.<ref>Holden, Stephen.[http://theater.nytimes.com/2005/06/29/arts/music/29brow.html "Drive and Insecurity Meet, Creating Sparks at the Piano"]''The New York Times'', June 29, 2005</ref> He is the recipient of three [[Tony Awards]] for his work on ''[[Parade (musical)|Parade]]'' and ''[[The Bridges of Madison County (musical)|The Bridges of Madison County]]''.

==Career==
Brown grew up in the suburbs of [[New York City]], and attended the [[Eastman School of Music]] in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[New York (state)|New York]] for 2 years, rooming with fellow student, and vocalist, Christopher Mooney.<ref name=times1>Weber, Bruce.[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/02/theater/02brow.html?_r=1 "If Only the Cool Kids Could See Him Now (at Least Hear His Songs)"]''The New York Times'', October 1, 2008</ref> During summer, he attended [[French Woods Festival of the Performing Arts]] in Hancock, New York. He said ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'' and ''[[Sunday in the Park with George]]'' were two of his biggest influences, and had it not been for them, he would have joined a rock band and tried to be [[Billy Joel]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Jason Robert |year=2008 |title=Nicely done, schmuck |journal=The Sondheim Review |volume=XVI |issue=4 |page=25 |publisher=Sondheim Review, Inc. |issn=1076-450X }}</ref>

He began his career in New York City as an arranger, conductor, and pianist, working on shows such as [[William Finn]]'s ''[[A New Brain]]'', and playing at several nightclubs and piano bars in the city. ''[[Songs for a New World]]'' marked the first major New York production of Brown's songs. An off-Broadway revue with a limited run, the show was directed by Daisy Prince, daughter of director/producer [[Hal Prince]], and featured the 25-year-old Brown's pop-rock-influenced music.<ref>[http://www.lortel.org/LLA_archive/index.cfm?search_by=show&id=605  'Songs for a New World' listing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001204217/http://www.lortel.org/lla_archive/index.cfm?search_by=show&id=605 |date=2015-10-01 }} lortel.org, accessed February 1, 2010</ref>  The song "Stars and the Moon" has since become a cabaret standard, and is probably Brown's best-known composition to date.<ref name=wing/>

Brown was subsequently hired to write songs for the Broadway musical ''[[Parade (musical)|Parade]]'', based on the trial and lynching of [[Leo Frank]], after meeting [[Hal Prince]]. ''Parade,'' directed by Prince and with a book by [[Alfred Uhry]], won Brown the 1999 [[Tony Award for Best Original Score]].<ref name=broadway>[http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=11446 Internet Broadway Database listing, Brown] ibdb.com, accessed February 1, 2011</ref> During this production, [[Livent]], one of the producers of ''Parade'', pulled out after reviews were not as positive as they'd hoped. [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]], the other major producer, decided it would pull out as well. Brown said of the event in 1999, "Livent dropped out shortly after the reviews came out. They announced they would not spend another dime on the show. RCA had an agreement to record all of Livent's shows. But when Livent pulled out of 'Parade,' the RCA higher-ups said they were pulling out, too. I had to go to Billy Rosenfield and ask him: 'What if we pay for this record and you just distribute it?' Billy said, 'Sure.'" Brown had to try to scrounge money from every corner, "In the end, RCA put in $25,000, Lincoln Center put in a big chunk, around $200,000, including the producer Scott Rudin's $25,000, and there was a contribution from the [[Gilman & Gonzalez-Falla Theatre Foundation|Gilman and Gonzalez-Falla foundation]], which has helped support a lot of musical theatre composers over the years, of $40,000. Even Roy Furman, the new guy at Livent, gave us a little money. Somehow, we pulled it together." Livent also was struggling at the time because the company had mishandled funds while applying for bankruptcy protection.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/29/theater/theater-trying-to-keep-the-sound-of-musicals-alive.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |title=THEATER; Trying to Keep the Sound of Musicals Alive – New York Times |work=Nytimes.com |date=1999-08-29 |access-date=2014-07-04}}</ref>

Brown went back to working with Daisy Prince for his third major show ''[[The Last Five Years]]'', for which he wrote the book as well as songs. Inspired by his own failed first marriage, the show is a two-person musical that tells the history of a relationship from two different perspectives. The male's narrative begins at the beginning of the story and progresses through marriage, infidelity, and divorce, while the female narrative begins at the end of the relationship and ends with the couple's first date; the two actors' only direct interaction takes place midpoint, during the wedding sequence.<ref>Sommer, Elyse [http://www.curtainup.com/last5years.html "A CurtainUp Review, 'The Last 5 Years' "] curtainup.com, March 5, 2002</ref> The original Chicago cast consisted of [[Norbert Leo Butz]] and [[Lauren Kennedy]], with [[Sherie Rene Scott]] over the New York run. ''The Last Five Years'' received mixed critical reviews and was not a commercial success, lasting only two months off-Broadway, although Brown garnered 2 [[Drama Desk Award]]s for music and lyrics. Additionally, due to the cast recording featuring Scott and Butz, the show has gained popularity among contemporary musical theatre aficionados and is an oft-performed piece in regional and community theatres.<ref>[http://www.lortel.org/LLA_archive/index.cfm?search_by=show&id=408  'The Last Five Years' listing] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019084133/http://www.lortel.org//lla_archive/index.cfm?search_by=show&id=408 |date=2007-10-19 }} lortel.org, accessed February 1, 2010</ref><ref name=times2>Holden, Stephen.[http://theater.nytimes.com/2007/02/12/arts/music/12brow.html  "A Composer Sells His Songs and Himself"]''The New York Times'', February 12, 2007</ref> [[The Last Five Years (film)|A film version]] of the show, featuring [[Anna Kendrick]] and [[Jeremy Jordan (actor, born 1984)|Jeremy Jordan]], was released in February 2015.<ref name="Gioia">{{cite news|last=Gioia |first=Michael |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/175246-Jeremy-Jordan-and-Anna-Kendrick-Will-Explore-The-Last-Five-Years-On-Screen-in-Richard-LaGravenese-Adaptation |title=Jeremy Jordan and Anna Kendrick Will Explore The Last Five Years On Screen in Richard LaGravenese Adaptation |url-status=dead |access-date=2013-03-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224052547/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/175246-Jeremy-Jordan-and-Anna-Kendrick-Will-Explore-The-Last-Five-Years-On-Screen-in-Richard-LaGravenese-Adaptation |archive-date=2013-02-24 }}</ref>

Brown contributed several songs to the Broadway flop ''[[Urban Cowboy (musical)|Urban Cowboy]]''. He had worked as an orchestrator with director Phillip Oesterman on the Off-Broadway musical ''[[New York Rock]]'', and Oesterman called on him to help him out with ''Urban Cowboy''. ''Urban Cowboy'' had been denied the use of the [[Clint Black]] catalog, and Brown came in and wrote a few songs (with help from director [[Lonny Price]], who replaced Oesterman after he died).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akB_dpXZkbY |title=ATW's Working in the Theatre #311 Production: "Urban Cowboy" (Spring 2003) Extended |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2014-07-04}}</ref>  The show was nominated, with 30 other composers, for the 2003 [[Tony Award]] for Best Musical Score, losing out to ''Hairspray.''<ref name=broadway/><ref>[[Simonson, Robert]].[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/78708-Urban-Cowboy-to-Close-on-Broadway-March-29-Will-Tour-in-2004  "Urban Cowboy to Close on Broadway March 29; Will Tour in 2004"], playbill.com, March 28, 2003</ref>

In June 2005, Brown released a solo album, entitled ''[[Wearing Someone Else's Clothes]]''.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009S2TG6 "Wearing Someone Else's Clothes" listing] amazon.com, accessed February 1, 2010</ref>

In December 2005, his ''[[Chanukah Suite]]'' received its world premiere with two performances by the [[Los Angeles Master Chorale]] at the [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]].<ref>[http://www.seattlechoralcompany.org/Concerts/ACathedralChristmasNotes.aspx Notes for Chanukah Suite] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607094011/http://www.seattlechoralcompany.org/Concerts/ACathedralChristmasNotes.aspx |date=2009-06-07 }} seattlechoralcompany.org, ca 2009, accessed February 1, 2010</ref>

He also teaches courses in musical theatre performance and composition at the [[University of Southern California]]. Brown is an active performer of his own work, singing and playing the piano with or without his band, the Caucasian Rhythm Kings (Gary Sieger, guitar, and Randy Landau, bass).<ref name=times2/>

Brown's tween-oriented musical ''[[13 (musical)|13]]'' premiered at the [[Mark Taper Forum]] in Los Angeles, CA on January 7, 2007. It opened on Broadway October 5, 2008, at the [[Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre]], and closed on January 4, 2009.<ref name=times1/><ref name=broadway/>

==Musical style==

Brown has many trademarks in his composing style, which is often rhythmically dynamic and harmonically unconventional, calling for a wide vocal range. His vocal lines often include internal rhymes, as well as melodic phrases which do not adhere to a predictable 4-measure length. He favors songs written in [[Thirty-two-bar form|AABA']] form, with some exceptions to this form in his show ''Parade''. Perhaps most characteristic are his love duets; all five ("I'd Give it All for You" from ''Songs for a New World'', "All the Wasted Time" from ''Parade'', "The Next Ten Minutes" from ''The Last Five Years'', "Tell Her" from ''13'', and "One Second And A Million Miles" from ''The Bridges of Madison County'') are written in a very distinct format: male-female-both, compound time in the duet section (two using [[hemiola]]), and four of the five end with the couple singing the same pitch.<ref>Nisbet, I. (2014), [http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/journals/view-Article,id=19232/ ‘“Don’t Ya Think That’s Pretty Music?” – Jason Robert Brown’s melodic construction from Songs for a New World to The Last Five Years’], Studies in Musical Theatre 8: 3, pp. 239–255, doi: 10.1386/smt.8.3.239_1</ref>

In 2005, Brown was cited by [[Mark Shenton]] as one of the leading new theatrical composers (a list that includes [[Michael John LaChiusa]], [[Adam Guettel]], [[Andrew Lippa]], and [[Jeanine Tesori]], among others).<ref>Shenton, Mark.[http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/mt/mt-search.cgi?blog_id=2&tag=Andrew%20Lippa&limit=20&IncludeBlogs=2 "Broadways Young(er) Composers"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319150614/http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/mt/mt-search.cgi?blog_id=2&tag=Andrew%20Lippa&limit=20&IncludeBlogs=2 |date=2012-03-19 }}''The Stage'', December 7, 2005</ref>
