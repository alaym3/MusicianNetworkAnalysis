'''Rings of Saturn''' is an American [[deathcore]] band from the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]], [[California]]. The band was formed in 2009 and was originally just a studio project. However, after gaining a wide popularity and signing to [[Unique Leader Records]], the band formed a full line-up and became a full-time touring band. Rings of Saturn's music features a highly technical style, heavily influenced by themes of [[Extraterrestrial life|alien life]] and [[outer space]]. They have released five full-length albums, with their third, ''[[Lugal Ki En]]'', released in 2014 and peaking at 126 on the American [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart while their fourth, ''[[Ultu Ulla]]'' was released in 2017 and peaked at 76 on the ''Billboard'' 200, making it the band's highest peak to date. ''[[Gidim (album)|Gidim]]'' was released in October 2019.<ref name="Billboard">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/1561870/rings-of-saturn/chart|title=Billboard|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=August 28, 2015}}</ref>

==History==
Rings of Saturn was formed in 2009 in high school only as a studio recording project with Lucas Mann on guitars, bass, and keyboards, Peter Pawlak on vocals, and Brent Silletto on drums. The band posted a track titled "Abducted" online and quickly gained listeners. The band recorded their debut album, ''[[Embryonic Anomaly]]'', with Bob Swanson at Mayhemnness Studios in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento, CA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiemerch.com/uniqueleaderusa/item/14163 |title=Unique Leader Records Store |publisher=Indiemerch.com |access-date=August 22, 2014}}</ref> The album was self-released by the band on May 25, 2010. Four months after releasing ''Embryonic Anomaly'', the band signed to Unique Leader Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=149996 |title=Rings Of Saturn Signs With Unique Leader Records |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=November 25, 2010 |access-date=August 22, 2014}}</ref> In the months following the band's signing, Joel Omans was added as a second guitarist and the band graduated high school which led to their embarking on tours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://altrocklive.com/blog/2011/02/rings-of-saturn-gets-a-new-guitarist/ |title=Rings of Saturn gets a new guitarist &#124; Alt Rock Live Blog |publisher=Altrocklive.com |date=February 24, 2011 |access-date=August 22, 2014}}</ref> ''Embryonic Anomaly'' was re-released through Unique Leader on March 1, 2011,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=62483 |title=Rings Of Saturn Signs With Unique Leader Records – in Metal News |publisher=Metal Underground.com |access-date=August 22, 2014}}</ref> and their two following albums would later also be released through the label. Brent Silletto and Peter Pawlak both left the band in December 2011.

Rings of Saturn, which at this point only included Lucas Mann and Joel Omans, toured with many different touring members before forming a line-up which added Ian Bearer, Sean Martinez and Ian Baker on vocals, bass, and drums respectively. This line-up recorded their second album, ''[[Dingir (album)|Dingir]]'', with the same producer from ''Embryonic Anomaly''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecirclepit.com/2012/10/rings-of-saturn-dingir-album-review.html |title=Rings Of Saturn "Dingir" Album Review / Stream! |publisher=The Circle Pit |date=October 28, 2012 |access-date=August 22, 2014}}</ref> The album was originally scheduled to be released on November 20, 2012, but due to legal issues, the album release was pushed back to February 5, 2013. In response to the legal push and a pre-production version of the album leaking on the internet, the vocalist, Ian Bearer, uploaded the finished album on his [[YouTube]] channel and put up the entire album for download via Total Deathcore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=85839 |title=Rings Of Saturn Streaming Full New Album – in Metal News |publisher=Metal Underground.com |access-date=August 22, 2014}}</ref> Ian Baker and Sean Martinez parted ways with the band shortly after the official release of Dingir, the band later took part in The Summer Slaughter Tour of 2013 adding Jesse Beahler for drums until the end of the tour.

Rings of Saturn went into recording their 3rd studio album in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, having Aaron Kitcher of [[Infant Annihilator]] and Black Tongue to fill in all drums arrangements as a special guest on the album. Aaron Stechauner later joined as a full-time member for drums after the album was finished. On July 1, 2014, the band released the cover art and track list to their new album ''[[Lugal Ki En]]'' which was released on October 14, 2014.  They also released their first music video for "Senseless Massacre" directed by Alex T Reinhard. The band toured the United States, Canada, and for the first time Mexico shortly after but no new songs were played from the newly released album. On December 9, 2014, Joel Omans announced his departure from the band, stating on his personal Facebook that he left because Lucas Mann became "a hack of a musician" and "hindered the band from playing new songs from Lugal Ki En" during its album release tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/10872339_10202089547040263_320503030_n.jpg|format=JPG|title=Reasons for departure|publisher=Metalsucks.net|access-date=January 15, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/drama/former-rings-of-saturn-guitarist-calls-lucas-mann-a-hack-of-a-musician|title=Former RINGS OF SATURN Guitarist Calls Lucas Mann "A Hack Of A Musician"|work=Metal Injection|access-date=January 15, 2015}}</ref> Two weeks later, on December 26, Miles Dimitri Baker was announced as their new second guitarist.
