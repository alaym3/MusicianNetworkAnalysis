'''Elysian Fields''' is an American band based in [[Brooklyn, New York]], founded in 1995 by the co-composers [[Jennifer Charles]] (vocals, instruments) and [[Oren Bloedow]] ([[guitar]]). Their music has sometimes been described as "noir rock",<ref>{{cite web|first=Sara |last=Ivry |title=Mediterranean Melodies |url=http://www.tabletmag.com/tag/elysian-fields/ |publisher=Tabletmag.com|date=20 October 2008|accessdate=2 March 2010}}</ref>  due to its sultry, dark and mysterious inflections, be it sonically or lyrically. The band uses mainly acoustic instruments, predominantly guitar, piano, bass and drums, with the occasional appearance of eastern instruments, classical strings, and subtle electronics, the focal point being the voice of Charles in the forefront.

Based in [[New York City]], Elysian Fields have found underground success in the United States but are more popular in Europe.<ref name=about /> The author of ''The Dark Stuff'', [[Nick Kent]], says of their music, "Maybe we have their out-of-the-mainstreamness to thank for a sound that is still unique -- as sensual as a sleepwalker's wet dream."<ref>{{cite web |title=Elysian Fields |author=Kent, Nick |author-link=Nick Kent |url=http://next.liberation.fr/guide/2003/05/30/elysian-fields_435267 |publisher=Liberation |date=30 May 2003 |accessdate=2 March 2010}}</ref> Since its formation, the band has won quite a devoted cult following, largely by word of mouth.<ref name=about /> Besides its well received albums, the band is also noted for its strong live performances.<ref name=about>{{cite web |title=Elysian Fields About [official biography on their website] |url=http://www.elysianmusic.com/about.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302123947/http://www.elysianmusic.com/about.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 March 2016 |publisher=elysianmusic.com |accessdate=2 March 2016}}</ref> The rest of the band has included many of New York's strongest players: all the members of [[Jeff Buckley]]'s band, members of [[Medeski Martin and Wood]], Ed Pastorini, [[Ben Perowsky]], [[James Genus]], [[Doveman|Thomas Bartlett]], [[Jamie Saft]] and members of [[Ollabelle]] have all played in Elysian Fields at various times.<ref name=about />

== History ==
Founders Jennifer Charles and Oren Bloedow had in common a mutual love for artists of multiple genres such as [[The Beatles]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Charles Mingus]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Captain Beefheart]], [[Ravi Shankar]], and classical composers like [[Frederic Chopin]] and [[Olivier Messiaen]].<ref name=about /> Elysian Fields first released an [[Extended play|EP]] in 1995 on Radioactive/[[Universal Records]] with cameos from [[John Lurie]] and [[Marc Ribot]], which was followed with the critically acclaimed full-length album, ''Bleed Your Cedar''. The band then recorded its second album with [[Steve Albini]] which was never released because of artistic differences between the band and the record company. Despite their record company's urgings, Charles and Bloedow did not want to give the recording a more commercial feel, prompting a split with Radioactive/Universal, who retain the recording. Charles said, "We made our second full length with Steve Albini. It wasn't at all what the label was looking for, or wanted. The label wanted us to redo things, go in with more commercial people, and give them songs that they could sell. I didn't want to mess with what we made with Steve. It was what it was. In the end we agreed to disagree, I asked to be released from my contract, and we parted ways. For now it sits in some vault gathering dust, I suppose."<ref name=about /> (Entitled ''Clinical Trial'', the album was eventually released on the band's bandcamp page in 2014.)

In 2000, the band recorded a one-off album for Jetset records, ''Queen of the Meadow'', which the band toured extensively in Europe, and which reached number 5 on the [[CMJ]] charts in the US. [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] went on to use one of the songs, "Rope of Weeds", in one of his plays. In June 2003, the band released ''Dreams That Breathe Your Name'' in [[France]] and [[Benelux]] on PIAS and Bang Records respectively, followed by an American release in 2004 on their own label Diluvian. The album was called "Close to noir-rock perfection" by the ''TimeoutNY'' music editor, Mike Wolf.<ref name=about />

A further album, ''Bum Raps and Love Taps'', was released in Europe in late 2005/early 2006 on the Naive label and lead to the band touring in Europe for much of 2005 and 2006. The album is dedicated to Charles' grandmother, about whom the title track was written. Another song "'Duel with Cudgels", eight minutes and thirty seconds, takes its title from a [[Goya]] painting. Their music is lush and melancholy, with poetic and sometimes surreal lyrics. In fall 2006, the video artist [[Vincent Moon]] filmed two live videos of Elysian Fields for [[La Blogotheque]] (also seen on [[YouTube]]), one of which is for the song "We're in Love", the duo acoustic final track on the ''Bum Raps'' album. This album was finally released in the US in late 2008 on the band's Diluvian imprint.

In addition to contributing to many of [[John Zorn]]'s produced compilation records, including one of [[Marc Bolan]] and the first track on the [[Great Jewish Music: Serge Gainsbourg|Serge Gainsbourg tribute]], Charles and Bloedow also released two complete albums of [[Sephardic]] songs on Zorn's Tzadik label: ''La Mar Enfortuna'' (2001) and  ''Convivencia'' (2007). They give ancient Moorish melodies a revamp with their signature Elysian Fields sound. Charles sings in [[Judeo-Spanish|Ladino]] as well as in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Aramaic]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] on these albums. Elysian Fields have also performed in several tribute concerts produced by the impresario [[Hal Willner]], including one of [[Randy Newman]]'s songs in Los Angeles, where Oren was a musical director, and another for [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. Elysian Fields performed at the [[Carnegie Hall]] on April 5, 2007, in [[Michael Dorf (entrepreneur)|Michael Dorf]]'s all star tribute to Bruce Springsteen; Oren was once again musical director, backing up several artists including [[Badly Drawn Boy]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]] himself for the rousing finale of "Rosalita". Elysian Fields rendition of "Streets of Fire" was noted in both ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' as being one of the show's highlights, and described as "sensual" and "passionate".  In February 2009, Elysian Fields performed in Paris in a sold-out show at the Salle Pleyel, as part of John Zorn's Serge Gainsbourg tribute concert alongside [[Marc Ribot]] and [[Sean Lennon]].

In 2009, the band released ''The Afterlife'' on Vicious Circle records, which was received with high critical praise. European tours followed,
along with sold-out concerts in several major cities.

According to the liner notes, their 2020 album ''Transience of Life'' was inspired by the 18th-century Chinese novel ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]'' by [[Cao Xueqin]].

Elysian Fields' music has appeared in films as well as many television shows including ''[[Damages (TV series)|Damages]]'', ''[[Conviction (2006 TV series)|Conviction]]'', ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', ''[[Charmed]]'', ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'', ''[[Extra (U.S. TV program)|Extra]]'', ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]'' and ''[[Lipstick Jungle (TV series)|Lipstick Jungle]]''. "Black acres" from ''Queen of the Meadow'' was used in a 2011 [[Lavazza]] advertisement.<ref name=about />
