==History==

===Inception===
Rafael Ithier had been a member of [[Rafael Cortijo]]'s "Cortijo y su Combo" orchestra. After singer [[Ismael Rivera]] faced legal drug possession problems when arriving from [[Panama]], some of the group's musicians departed, with Ithier relocating temporarily to the eastern United States. Rafael Álvarez Guedes, the [[Cuba|Cuban-born]] owner of the Gema recording label (and brother of comedic actor [[Guillermo Alvarez Guedes|Guillermo]]) needed a backing band to record an album for legendary [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] [[Merengue music|merengue]] singer [[Joseíto Mateo]]. He asked Ithier for assistance, and Ithier responded by bringing in many of his former colleagues return to the studio. For their first recording sessions, the orchestra included some musicians from Cortijo's original lineup, including saxophonist Hector Santos, trumpet player Rogelio "Kito" Velez, and percussionists Martín Quiñones, Miguel Cruz and [[Roberto Roena]]. Alvarez Guedes wanted to name the group Rafael Ithier Y Su Combo in relation to Cortijo, but Ithier refused the name and the name El Gran Combo was born, as to refer to the musicians' former affiliation, but addressing their regrouping as a "new and improved" version of Cortijo's orchestra. The album they recorded was titled ''Menéame Los Mangos, El Gran Combo con [[Joseito Mateo]]'' (the phrase translates as ''Shake Your Mangoes for Me,'' a double entendre).<ref>[http://www.musicofpuertorico.com/index.php/artists/el_gran_combo/ ''El Gran Combo.''] Evan Bailyn. 2006. Retrieved 2 Sept 2012.</ref>

The group met again to define the foundations of a proper orchestra and chose singers Daniel Vázquez, [[Pellin Rodríguez|Pellín Rodríguez]] and Chiquitín García (who later composed among other major EGC hits, ''"No Hago Más Ná",'' and many of Gran Combo's hits). On May 21, 1962, El Gran Combo was heard for the first time on Puerto Rican radio. Later on, they became the in-studio musicians of the live television show, "La Taberna India", sponsored by [[Compañía Cervecera de Puerto Rico|India Beer]].''

After their live debut at Hotel La Concha in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], Chiquitín García left the orchestra. Vocalist Sammy Ayala, who had also played with Ithier in the Cortijo orchestra, recommended the hiring of Andy Montañez. Andy Montañez was singer for a trio in Puerto Rico and had never sung salsa?

===First albums===
On November 20, 1963, El Gran Combo released their first group album, ''Menéame los mangos'', with Joseito Mateo as lead singer. Later came ''Acángana''.  This album became a number-one hit in [[New York City]], [[Panama]] and [[Puerto Rico]]. Their success opened doors for them in many [[Latin American]] markets and they gained an exclusivity spot on the [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] television show ''[[El Show de las 12]]''. The album also reached gold status.

In 1964, trumpet player and arranger Elías Lopes joined the orchestra, coinciding with the group's first popularity wave. With their daily TV appearances and extensive touring, however, demand for the group declined due to overexposure. Still, in 1967, their album ''Boogaloo con el Gran Combo'' also reached gold status. In 1969, Roena and Lopes left the orchestra to form the ''Apollo Sound'' together. Despite all this, that same year the group was awarded an ''Agüeybana de Oro'' in Puerto Rico.  Also, in 1969, Rafael Ithier hired dancer/choreographer Mike Ramos to implement dance routines, which became a signature of El Gran Combo's live performances.  Mike came from the world-famous New York City Palladium Ballroom scene. Prior to joining El Gran Combo, Mike danced with the Tito Puente Orchestra and Perez Prado Band among others.

===The 1970s===
In 1970, El Gran Combo's contract with Gema Records was not renewed. Despite offers from other record companies including the [[Motown]] label, the group decided to self-release recordings under their own newly created independent label, Combo Records (alternatively known as EGC Records). The first album released on the label was the 1970 album entitled ''Estamos Primeros''. On February 15, 1970, the members of ''El Gran Combo'' shared a near death experience. They were at [[Venezuela]], and scheduled to fly the following day to [[Las Américas International Airport]] in [[Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic]]. After landing they were told about [[Dominicana DC-9 air disaster|the Dominicana Airlines DC-9 that crashed off the Caribbean coast]] which occurred the night before. Therefore, the tale about a group member having a bad feeling regarding that flight while stranded at the Santo Domingo airport is not entirely true, since they did not arrive there until the day after the crash.<ref>{{cite news|title=Una tragedia aérea que aún duele|url=http://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/nota/unatragediaaereaqueaunduele-1188363/|access-date=4 September 2015|work=[[El Nuevo Día]]|date=12 February 2012|language=es}}</ref>

In 1971, El Gran Combo introduced the [[trombone]] to their instrument mix. The trombone was played by Fanny Ceballos. Soon after, their production named ''De Punta a Punta'' was released. In 1972, they released the album "Por el Libro", which marks the 10th anniversary of the orchestra. Pellín Rodriguez left the group to embark on a solo career. Rodríguez was replaced by Charlie Aponte at the recommendation of Jerry Concepción and the well known [[sports]]caster [[Rafael Bracero]], both friends of Ithier.

In 1973, El Gran Combo sang in front of 50,000 fans at the famous [[Yankee Stadium]] in New York City as the opening act for the [[Fania All-Stars]]' sold out concert.

Montañez left the band in early 1977 and went to live in [[Venezuela]] where he replaced [[Oscar D'León]] in another orchestra, '''[[Dimension Latina]]'''. Jerry Rivas was then chosen to join the orchestra.  The success of this new duo was proved with their 1977 album ''International'' and 1978's ''En Las Vegas'' which reached gold record status.

In 1966, ''En Navidad'', a [[Christmas album]], was released, with Martín Quiñones appearing as [[Santa Claus]] in the album's cover. After an automobile accident in early 1977, Quiñones was replaced in the band by his son, Martín Quiñones Jr. He stayed until 1979, being replaced by Miguel “El Pollo” Torres.

===Recent years===
The band continues to receive numerous awards throughout Latin America. In 1984, they traveled to [[Alaska]] where they received a great welcome soon after they released their album titled ''[[Breaking the Ice (album)|In Alaska: Breaking the Ice]]'' which garnered them their first [[Grammy]] nomination.

In 1982 they celebrated their 20th anniversary playing at [[Madison Square Garden]]. They also reached Europe that year playing in Paris, France.

In the early 1990s, they were honored in the city of Madrid, Spain to open the decade on the right track. On March 29, 1992, they celebrated a huge concert in the [[Hiram Bithorn Stadium]] in front of 30,000 people.

===The new millennium===
In 2000, El Gran Combo was inducted into the [[International Latin Music Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite news|title=International Latin Music Hall of Fame Announces Year 2000 Inductees|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/international-latin-music-hall-of-fame-announces-year-2000-inductees-72842402.html|access-date=31 October 2015|date=1 March 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306081458/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/international-latin-music-hall-of-fame-announces-year-2000-inductees-72842402.html|archive-date=6 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2002, the group celebrated their 40th anniversary with two sold-out concerts at the [[Coliseo Rubén Rodríguez|Ruben Rodríguez Coliseum]] in [[Bayamón, Puerto Rico]]. This celebration spawned an album. In the same year, they were awarded the [[Billboard Latin Music Lifetime Achievement Award]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Juan Gabriel Cleans Up At Billboard Latin Awards|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/75804/juan-gabriel-cleans-up-at-billboard-latin-awards|website=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|access-date=December 7, 2017|date=May 10, 2002}}</ref> A year later, in 2003, they received a Grammy<ref>[http://www.visitflorida.com/insiders/viva/action.blog/7131-el-gran-combo-de-puerto-rico-coming-to-south-florida-on-aug-1 ''El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico coming to South Florida on Aug. 1.''] Visit Florida. Florida Tourism Industry Marketing Corporation. July 01, 2012. Retrieved 3 September 2012.</ref> for ''Best Tropical Album''. Among other musicians, they are one of the "enduring superstars of the island."<ref>Lonely Planet Puerto Rico: Peffer Published, p. 42</ref>

{{As of|2006}}, the orchestra has released over 40 albums or [[CD]]'s, and it has received many awards, including golden albums, a "Calendario de Plata" in Mexico, a "Golden Congo" in [[Colombia]], a Paoli Award in their native Puerto Rico, an honorable distinction in Spain and countless others.

In 2006, they released their album titled ''Arroz con Habichuela'' ("Rice and Beans"). It has already spawned three hit singles. The first one titled "No Hay Manera" ("There's No Way"), the title song, and "Si la ves por ahí".

Around 2006, Rafael Ithier became ill and decided to take a back seat for live performances and although he mostly still tours with the band, Ithier is just conducting the combo rather than playing the piano, however he is still very much the bandleader of the group.  Willie Sotelo has taken the place of Ithier on the piano and has also taken on some of the travel management duties as well.

In 2007, El Gran Combo performed two massive concerts at the [[José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum]] to celebrate their 45th anniversary.

In 2010, two tribute albums were released, one by former member Andy Montañez and another by the bank Banco Popular, as part of their annual music series.

In August 2011, El Gran Combo rewrote the lyrics to their own hit "No Hago Más Ná", or "I Don't Do Anything Else" that sang in satire about the day of a lazy person to a more positive "Echar Pa'lante" or "Moving Forward" which sang about the virtues of going to work.  They also released a video with a positive introductory message which showed clips of working people in similarities with them playing instruments.

The group is still going strong and working continuously. Some music historians have dubbed them ''La Universidad de la Salsa'' (The University of Salsa), which is also the title of their hit 1983 album.

Recent changes have occurred within the last several years.  On August 9, 2013 Founder musician Eddie "La Bala" Perez died due to health complications.  On December 12, 2014, Charlie Aponte, one of the vocalists of El Gran Combo for 41 years, retired for personal reasons and launched his own orchestra. His last performance was in Cali, Colombia on December 30, 2014.  On January 24, 2015 Anthony Garcia became the new vocalist, as Aponte's replacement. Later in the year, El Gran Combo received the [[Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].<ref name="2015recipients">{{cite web|last=Cantor-Navas|first=Judy|title=Latin Academy Honors Diverse Artists With Lifetime Achievement Awards|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/6699645/latin-academy-lifetime-achievement-awards|access-date=February 19, 2016|date=September 16, 2015|website=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Gato Barbieri, Ana Belen & Victor Manuel, Angela Carrasco, Djavan, El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico, and Pablo Milanes to be honored with The Latin Recording Academy® Lifetime Achievement Award|url=http://www.latingrammy.com/en/news/gato-barbieri-ana-belen-victor-manuel-angela-carrasco-djavan-el-gran-combo-de-puerto-rico-and|publisher=Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences|access-date=May 31, 2016|date=September 15, 2015}}</ref> Two years later, they were presented with the [[ASCAP Latin Heritage Award]].<ref name="ascaplatin">{{cite web|url=https://www.ascap.com/news-events/awards/latin-heritage-award#:~:text=Awarded%20to%20songwriters%20and%20composers,and%20enduring%20contributions%20to%20music.|title=ASCAP Latin Heritage Award|publisher=ASCAP|access-date=December 8, 2020}}</ref>  In early 2019, Luis "Papo" Rosario, the main choreographer and third vocalist since 1980, retired.  Joselito Hernández was added as Rosario's replacement.
