===Musical style and themes===
Because the group is associated with the TV series and children's network [[Nickelodeon]], they have been presented as a "child-friendly" group, but have musical differences. In a review of their first studio album, ''[[BTR (album)|BTR]]'', Jessica Dawson from [[Common Sense Media]] wrote: "Big Time Rush is a standout, not only because of their boyish charm and good looks, but because their music is a cool blend of [[synth-pop]], [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]], and boy-band harmonies."<ref>Jessica Dawson (October 12, 2010), [http://www.commonsensemedia.org/music-reviews/btr "BTR – Music Review".] Commonsensemedia.org.

The group has been compared to other [[boy band]]s of the time such as [[One Direction]] and [[the Wanted]].<ref name="washington">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/big-time-rush-one-direction-the-wanted-the-boy-band-is-making-a-comeback/2012/03/20/gIQAxsvCSS_story.html |title=Big Time Rush, One Direction, the Wanted: The boy band is making a comeback |work=The Washington Post |date=March 22, 2012 |access-date=2013-06-14}}</ref> Michael O'Connell from ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said "One Direction is but one group in this resilient and timeless fad. They follow the recent success of fellow Brits [the Wanted] and Nickelodeon's cross-market creation [Big Time Rush]. One [One Direction] is fluke. Two [the Wanted] is a coincidence. And three [Big Time Rush] is a trend that you want to father your unborn children.'<ref name="reporter">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/earshot/one-direction-wanted-big-time-rush-boy-bands-303326 |title=One Direction, The Wanted and Big Time Rush: Breaking Down the Boy Band Renaissance |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=March 22, 2012 |access-date=2013-06-14}}</ref> Melinda Newman from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' stated "In the grand tradition of boy bands, these acts share certain traits with their similarly manufactured pop ancestors: Members of the Wanted and Big Time Rush auditioned for their parts at a casting call. The members of One Direction were put together by Simon Cowell after trying out individually for the British edition of ''The X Factor''."<ref name="washington" /> However, she positively compared them to [[the Monkees]] by saying "Big Time Rush is similar to the Monkees with its own TV series as a launchpad, and the group appeals to kids, tweens, teens, and adults. They are also credited as the pop group that have once again restored creditably, relevance, and for relaunching boy bands back into the public eye once again."<ref name="washington" />

In ''[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]''{{'}}s 2012 poll, Big Time Rush was voted the "Best Boy Band in the World", topping both [[One Direction]] and [[the Wanted]]. Over 800,000 votes were cast.

The show has definitely been our main audience. We have four million kids watching. So when you put a song out, four million kids hear it. When you put a song on the radio, you're not going to have four million people listening. It's a blessing and a curse being on Nickelodeon – it's gotten us where we are now, though some people are standoffish to us because of that. But we have to be grateful that Nickelodeon gave us this opportunity.
