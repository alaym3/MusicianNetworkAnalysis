'''Kevin Michael''' "'''GG'''" '''Allin''' (born '''<!--GG's birth name was Jesus Christ Allin. His name was changed to Kevin Michael Allin early in his adolescence. Please do not change.-->Jesus Christ<!--Do not change, this is correct.--> Allin'''; August 29, 1956 – June 28, 1993) was an American [[punk rock]] musician and songwriter who performed and recorded with many groups during his career.<ref>{{citation|last=Self Hatred Fanzine|title=GG Allin's Last Interview June '93|date=October 9, 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn4jd_Pc0T4|access-date=April 3, 2018}}</ref> Allin was best known for his controversial live performances, which often featured [[transgressive art|transgressive]] acts, including [[self-mutilation]], [[defecation|defecating]] on stage, and assaulting audience members, for which he was arrested and imprisoned on multiple occasions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-26/entertainment/ca-836_1_rock-singer|title=Pop/rock|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|access-date=March 10, 2012|date=August 26, 1991}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] called him "the most spectacular degenerate in rock n' roll history",<ref name="allmusic-bio">{{cite web |last=Huey |first=Steve |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/gg-allin-mn0000199240/biography |title=GG Allin Biography |publisher=[[AllMusic.com]]|access-date=March 10, 2012}}</ref> while [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4TV]]'s ''[[That's Tough]]'' labelled him the "toughest rock star in the world".

Known more for his notorious stage antics than for his music, Allin recorded prolifically, not only in the punk rock genre, but also in [[spoken word]], [[Country music|country]], and more traditional-style rock. His lyrics, which often expressed themes of violence and [[misanthropy]],{{sfn|Greene|2017|pages=39–48}} polarized listeners and created varied opinions of him within the highly politicized punk community.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

==Early life==
Allin was born <!--GG's birth name was Jesus Christ Allin(nah, what's his name for real? Jesus Christ Allin, sorry). His name was changed to Kevin Michael Allin early in his adolescence. Please do not change.-->Jesus Christ Allin<!--Do not change, this is correct.--> at Weeks Memorial Hospital in [[Lancaster, New Hampshire]], the younger of two sons born to Merle Colby Allin Sr. (1923–2001) and Arleta Gunther (1936–2019).<ref name="Allmusic"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10162147607940591&id=585345590 |title=Merle C.

Allin's family lived in a [[log cabin]] with no running water or electricity in [[Groveton, New Hampshire]]. His father was an abusive [[Religious fanaticism|religious fanatic]] who threatened his family with death, digging graves in their cellar and threatening to fill them in the near future.<ref name="rockstarmartyr.net">{{cite web|url=http://rockstarmartyr.net/eat-shit-and-die-gg-allins-first-name-was-jesus-christ/|title=Eat Shit and Die: GG Allin's First Name Was Jesus Christ|access-date=November 5, 2016}}</ref> In an essay titled "The First Ten Years", Allin wrote that Merle Sr. wanted to kill his family in a [[murder–suicide]]. He "despised pleasure" and allowed his family "very little contact with others". They lived a "primitive existence" and "were more like prisoners than a family". Allin also stated that his mother attempted to escape before she filed for divorce, but Merle Sr. thwarted the attempt by [[kidnapping]] Allin.<ref>Lifestory: GG Allin (including relevant excerpt of The First Ten Years) {{cite web |url=http://www.tincan.tv/features/music/382/life-story-gg-allin/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=January 1, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101101512/http://www.tincan.tv/features/music/382/life-story-gg-allin/ |archive-date=January 1, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/kissingtheflames/writings.htm|title=WRITINGS OF GG ALLIN|website=Oocities.org|access-date=September 18, 2020}}</ref> Allin said that he was glad to experience such an upbringing, and that it "made [him] a warrior soul at an early age."<ref name="rockstarmartyr.net"/>

In 1961, Arleta filed for divorce from Merle Sr., as his mental instability was worsening. Allin and his brother were from that time raised by their mother and stepfather, and settled in [[East St. Johnsbury, Vermont]], in 1966.<ref name="Allmusic"/> Arleta changed her younger son's legal name to Kevin Michael Allin on March 2, 1962, during his first year of schooling. Arleta had allowed his birth name to stand until this point and finally changed it to give her son a chance of a mockery-free childhood.

Allin, a poor student, was placed in [[special education]] classes and required to repeat the third grade. According to his older brother, he experienced [[bullying]] by fellow students for nonconformity.<ref name="hated">''[[Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies]]''.

==Recording career==

===Early years===
Allin's earliest musical influences were 1960s [[British Invasion]] bands including [[Mott the Hoople]], [[Mama Cass]], and [[the Dave Clark Five]].<ref name="hated-merleinterview">''[[Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies]]'' – Bonus features, "Merle & Dino Interview". Minute marker 0:00:23: "We were into, y'know, all the early British Invasion stuff, like the early-mid 60s... The Beatles, Greg Van Voorst, and The Rolling Stones, and The Dave Clark 5, and The Monkees, and all that kind of stuff, you know."</ref> In the early 1970s, [[Alice Cooper]] became an important influence on Allin.<ref name="ytmom">{{YouTube|eu8RRujy2RQ|Interview with GG Allin's mother part 1 }}</ref> Allin's earliest recorded musical endeavors were as a drummer. He also wrote most of his songs on an acoustic guitar. In his mid-teens, he and his older brother Merle, who plays bass guitar, formed their first band, Little Sister's Date, which lasted a little over a year.<ref name="hated-merleinterview" /> The group covered songs by [[Aerosmith]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], and other popular rock bands of the time period.<ref name="hated-merleinterview" /> Both Allin and Merle gained a strong interest in [[punk rock]]. [[The Ramones]] and [[the Stooges]] were major influences on Allin.

He graduated from Concord High School in [[Concord, Vermont]], in 1975, and shortly after formed the band Malpractice with his older brother, local musician Jeff Penney, and Brian Demurs (a high school friend). Allin played the drums for Malpractice until the band separated in 1977.

In September 1977 to April 1984, he started fronting [[the Jabbers]]. Allin's 1980 debut album was ''[[Always Was, Is and Always Shall Be]]'' for [[Orange Records]]. In addition to singing, he played drums on most tracks. It would be reissued for the first time on CD in 1995 by the Halycon imprint.  At one point, industry veteran and [[the Dead Boys]] producer [[Genya Ravan]] served as his manager. Tension within the Jabbers mounted as Allin grew uncontrollable, uncompromising, and vicious. The Jabbers disbanded the spring of 1984. Their second to last show was opening for [[Charged GBH]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/GGAllinAmericasFavoriteSonAutobiography/2005%20-%20America%E2%80%99s%20Favorite%20Son%20-%20GG%20Allin%20Autobiography_djvu.txt|title = GG Allin - America's Favorite Son (Autobiography)}}</ref>

Allin fronted many acts during the early to mid-1980s. This includes albums from the Cedar Street Sluts, the Scumfucs in 1982, and the Texas Nazis in 1985. Allin remained in the [[Underground music|underground]] [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]] scene, yet was not part of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] hardcore scene. His performances in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]], with the Cedar Street Sluts earned him the nickname of "the Madman of Manchester".

Allin gained wider attention with the [[ROIR]] cassette-only release of ''[[Hated in the Nation (album)|Hated in the Nation]]'' (1987) containing tracks from Allin's out-of-print catalog with the Jabbers, the Scumfucs, and the Cedar Street Sluts. The tape also featured several in-studio and in-concert recordings with an all-star band assembled by producer ''[[Maximum RocknRoll]]'' and early Allin patron [[Mykel Board]]. This band featured [[J Mascis]] of [[Dinosaur Jr.]] on lead guitar and [[Bongwater (band)|Bongwater]] record producer/musician [[Kramer (musician)|Mark Kramer]] on bass.

===Mid-era and more extreme live performances===
{{more citations needed section|date=October 2012}}
By the mid- to late 1980s, Allin was an alcoholic and generally abused any drugs provided to him. 

Allin first defecated onstage in 1985 at a show in [[Peoria, Illinois]]. According to fellow performer Bloody Mess, "I was with him when he bought the [[Ex-Lax]]. Unfortunately, he ate it hours before the show, so he constantly had to hold it in or he would've shit before he got onstage... After he shit onstage, complete chaos broke out in the hall... All of the old men in charge of the hall went fucking NUTS!.. Hundreds of confused punk kids were flipping out, running out the door, because the smell was INCREDIBLE."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/swedishscum/bloodymess/interview.html|title=interview with Bloody F. Mess by Swedish Scum|website=Oocities.org|access-date=September 18, 2020}}</ref> [[Defecation]] became a regular part of his stage act.

Allin idolized country music legend [[Hank Williams]] and saw himself as a kindred spirit. Both were relative loners and outsiders, both were habitual users of intoxicants, both lived with few (if any) possessions, and both traveled the country relentlessly. Allin's acoustic output, documented on the EP ''[[The Troubled Troubador]]'', was heavily influenced by Williams. He recorded his own rewrites of [[Hank Williams Jr.]]'s "Family Tradition" and [[David Allan Coe]]'s "Longhaired Redneck", calling his own versions "Scumfuc Tradition" and "Outlaw Scumfuc", respectively. Later, Allin also released another country album, ''[[Carnival of Excess: Limited Edition|Carnival of Excess]]'', his most refined set of recordings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bajalibros.com/AR/Nosotros-los-normales-GG-Ailli-Marcelo-Pisarro-eBook-1744047|title=Nosotros, los normales. GG Aillin en el infierno punk|website=BajaLibros.com|language=es|access-date=July 6, 2019}}</ref>

During this period, Allin collaborated with Bulge (Boston area band Psycho recording under a different name for the occasion) on the album ''[[Freaks, Faggots, Drunks and Junkies]]''), the Aids Brigade (the 7" EP ''Expose Yourself to Kids'') and the Holymen (''[[You Give Love a Bad Name (album)|You Give Love a Bad Name]]''). Allin also began performing many [[spoken word]] pieces. Video footage of these is available but rare. Unwilling to seek steady employment, Allin supported himself by selling his own records. Allin was also [[Murderabilia|fascinated with serial killers]]. He wrote to and visited [[John Wayne Gacy]] in prison a number of times, and Gacy painted a portrait of Allin, which became the album cover to the soundtrack of the film ''[[Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies]]''.

By this point, Allin's performances, which often resulted in considerable damage to venues and sound equipment, were regularly stopped by police or venue owners after only a few songs. Allin was charged with assault and [[Battery (crime)|battery]] or indecent exposure a number of times. His constant touring was only stopped by jail time or by long hospital stays for broken bones, blood poisoning, and other physical trauma.

Another attraction to Allin performances was his continual threats of suicide. In 1989, Allin wrote to ''Maximum RocknRoll'' stating that he would commit suicide on stage on Halloween 1989. However, he was in jail when that day came. He continued his threat each following year but ended up imprisoned each following Halloween. When asked why he did not follow through with his threats, Allin stated, "With GG, you don't get what you expect—you get what you deserve."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.killcreek.com/devolution/mykel/124.html |title=You're Wrong, No.&nbsp;124 |publisher=Killcreek.com |access-date=February 24, 2009}}</ref> He also stated that suicide should only be done when one had reached one's peak, meeting the afterlife at one's strongest point and not at one's weakest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/ekx001/MG/ANT1993MG.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050118083429/http://www.geocities.com/ekx001/MG/ANT1993MG.html |archive-date=January 18, 2005 |title=The GG Allin SuperSite Media Guide – Anthropomorphic No.&nbsp;1 – January 1993 |publisher=Geocities.com |date=March 26, 2004}}</ref>

In June 1993, Allin made an appearance on ''[[The Jane Whitney Show]]''. This interview is infamous for being his last interview and for Allin's aggression toward the audience. Allin openly stated that he would commit suicide and take his fans with him. When questioned by Jane, he clarified that he would make them commit suicide as well or he would kill them. Allin also stated that, at 35, he could sleep with 12-, 13- and 16-year-old girls, boys, and animals, and claimed that he raped both women and men at his concerts.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Jane Whitney Show – GG Allin 1993 FULL|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpEDdLgYDF8|language=en|access-date=October 12, 2019}}</ref>

[[File:Nov 1989 Letter..jpg|thumb|Letter from November 1989]]

===1989 trial and imprisonment===
In late 1989, Allin was arrested and charged with "assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder" of a female acquaintance in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]].

In a psychological evaluation made as part of the trial, Allin was judged as having at least average intelligence, and was described as "courteous, cooperative and candid". The unnamed evaluator noted that Allin did not appear [[psychotic]], and seemed comfortable with his unorthodox lifestyle. However, the evaluator asserted Allin was dependent on alcohol and had a [[mixed personality disorder]] with [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]], [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]] and [[self-defeating personality disorder|masochistic]] features.

Allin initially denied the charges, claiming that the woman was a willing participant in their sexual activities. Allin admitted to cutting her, burning her, and drinking her blood, but insisted that she did the same thing to him. Allin also claimed that inconsistencies in the woman's statements to authorities supported his assertions. The judge in the case agreed there were substantial inconsistencies in the woman's account. Ultimately, however, Allin plea bargained to the reduced charge of felonious assault, and he was imprisoned from December 25, 1989, to March 26, 1991.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thecarouser.com/2014/08/31/he-was-your-enemy-part-ii/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 24, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919002052/http://thecarouser.com/2014/08/31/he-was-your-enemy-part-ii/ |archive-date=September 19, 2015 }}</ref>

It was during this time in prison that Allin began feeling re-energized about his life and "mission". He wrote ''The GG Allin Manifesto''<ref>{{cite web|author=GG Allin ggallinonline.com |url=http://ggallinonline.com/mission.php |title=Text of the manifesto |publisher=Ggallinonline.com |date=October 31, 1990 |access-date=February 24, 2009}}</ref> during this period.

===''Hated'' documentary and final days===
{{main|Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies}}
After his release from prison, Allin skipped parole to go on another tour, footage of which was shot for [[Todd Phillips]]'s documentary ''[[Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies]]''. The film contained graphic scenes from a performance Allin gave at the rock club Space at Chase in [[Manhattan]]'s [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]. A heavily intoxicated Allin stripped naked, defecated on the floor, wiped his feces on himself and threw feces into the audience. He also threw beer bottles, breaking a woman's nose, and assaulted several other people in the crowd. Clips were included from other Allin appearances, as well as interviews with Allin, his band, and their fans. The film was released in 1994 and later followed on DVD in 1997.

In 1991, GG recorded an album entitled ''[[Murder Junkies]]'', released by New Rose Records, featuring [[Antiseen]] as his backing band. This album contained 10 musical tracks and 10 spoken-word pieces. Other than ''Freaks, Faggots, Drunks and Junkies'', Allin considered this album to be that which most accurately captured his persona and stated philosophy on life. It was also during this period that Allin recorded the album ''War in My Head – I'm Your Enemy'', released on [[Awareness Records]] and featuring the band Shrinkwrap. This particular album consists of one 45-minute track that is a [[Sound collage|collage]] of spoken-word pieces (mainly from the same recordings as ''Murder Junkies'') which Shrinkwrap put to music.

Allin's growing notoriety led to appearances on various television shows: ''[[Geraldo (TV series)|Geraldo]]'', ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'' and ''The Jane Whitney Show''. At the time of his death, Allin was making plans for a spoken-word album.<ref>{{cite web |author=Al Weisel |url=http://www.livefastdieyoungbook.com/spinggallin.htm |title=Al Weisel – Death of GG Allin |publisher=Livefastdieyoungbook.com |access-date=October 20, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127180133/http://www.livefastdieyoungbook.com/spinggallin.htm |archive-date=January 27, 2010 }}</ref> He also mentioned a somewhat unlikely European tour, enthusiastically talking about it in the hours before his death.<ref name="freakparade.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.scumfuc.narod.ru/story6.html|title=A Last Day in the Life of GG Allin|publisher=Freak Parade bassist Mike Bowling|access-date=March 14, 2012|date=August 1997}}</ref>

==Personal life==

===Family and relationships===
GG Allin married Sandra Farrow on October 6, 1978.<ref name="arrest">Jesus Christ Allin page: "[http://jesus-christallin.tumblr.com/post/668299872/gg-allins-partial-arrest-record-on-his-death-report GG Allin's Partial Arrest Record on His Death Report]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}."</ref> They divorced in 1985.<ref name="arrest" />

In the mid-1980s, Allin became involved with a teenage girl from [[Garland, Texas]] named Tracy Deneault.<ref name="arrest" /> She became pregnant, and their daughter, Nico Ann Deneault, was born March 13, 1986.<ref name="arrest" /> Nico chose to distance herself from her family.<ref name="ReferenceA">interview with Arleta on ''The Best of the Murder Junkies'' DVD</ref> Allin and Tracey Deneault never married.<ref name="arrest" /> At the time of his death, GG Allin's "girlfriend" was Liz Mankowski.

GG Allin's older brother [[Merle Allin]] served as bassist for his last band, the Murder Junkies.

===Beliefs===
Allin was a self-identified extreme [[Individualism|individualist]], [[Misanthropy|misanthrope]],{{sfn|Greene|2017|pages=39–48}} and [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]], promoting [[Lawlessness#In society|lawlessness]] and [[Anti-police sentiment|violence against police officers]] in many of his lyrics; his essay, ''The GG Allin Manifesto'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ggallinarchives.com/gg-allin-murder-junkies-and-the-gg-allin-manifesto/|title=GG Allin Archives – The GG Allin Manifesto|website=ggallinarchives.com}}</ref> was intended to summarize his personal philosophy. He revealed on ''[[Geraldo (TV series)|Geraldo]]'' that he believed his body to be a temple of rock and roll, and that his flesh, blood, and bodily fluids were a communion to the people. Another reason given for his onstage antics (by Dino, the drummer of his band) was that he wanted to draw a parallel between his actions and "a society that's going crazy with violence". He has also said that if he was not a performer, he would probably be a [[serial killer]] or a [[mass murderer]].<ref name="hated" />

Regarding Allin's views on death, he believed in some form of an [[afterlife]]. He planned to kill himself onstage on [[Halloween]] many times in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but was stopped due to prison sentences around Halloween each year. He explained his views on death in the film ''[[Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies]]'', stating: "It's like I've got this wild soul that just wants to get out of this life. It's too confined in this life. I think that to take yourself out at your peak... if you could die at your peak, your strongest point, then your soul will be that much stronger in the next existence."<ref>{{cite news |title = GG Allin – Hated: Special Edition |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9AvIpoV0ps |publisher = MVDmusicvideo |date = June 15, 2011 |access-date = September 2, 2013}}</ref>

==Death==
[[File:GG Allin Grave.jpg|thumb|Allin's grave in [[Littleton, New Hampshire]]]]
GG Allin's last show was on June 27, 1993, at a small club called The Gas Station, a punk venue located inside a former gas station at 194 East 2nd Street in [[Manhattan]]. The show ended after three songs, when a melee broke out. Allin ended up outside, leading a group of fans through the neighborhood.<ref name="freakparade.org" />

After walking the streets for almost an hour, Allin eventually went to Johnny Puke's apartment. There, he and others continued to party and use drugs. Along with Johnny Puke, Allin ingested large amounts of heroin, on which he overdosed and slipped into an unconscious state. Sometime in the early morning of June 28, Allin died from the effects of his heroin overdose. Later that morning, Puke noticed that Allin still lay motionless in the same place where he had left him and posed for Polaroids with the corpse before calling for an ambulance. Allin was pronounced dead at the scene. He was two months short of his 37th birthday.<ref name="freakparade.org" />

===Funeral===
Allin's funeral took place on July 3, 1993, in his native New Hampshire, at the St. Rose Cemetery, Littleton. At his funeral, Allin's bloated, unpreserved corpse was dressed in his black leather jacket and trademark jock strap.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9gBe5l-b8Y|title=GG Allins Funeral — The Final Hellride, 1993 (Full)|access-date=January 4, 2021|via=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> Allin was buried with a bottle of [[Jim Beam]] beside him in his casket, as requested (openly stated in his self-penned acoustic country ballad, "When I Die").

Allin's funeral became a low-level party.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ggallinarchives.com/gg-allins-funeral-the-final-hellride-vhs/|title=GG Allin Archives &#124; GG Allin's Funeral — "The Final Hellride," 1993|website=Ggallinarchives.com|access-date=September 18, 2020}}</ref> Friends posed with his corpse, placing drugs and whiskey into his mouth. As the funeral ended, his brother put a pair of headphones on Allin. The headphones were plugged into a portable cassette player, in which was loaded a copy of ''[[The Suicide Sessions]]''.

==Legacy==
Video footage of the soundcheck, concert, and aftermath from Allin's final concert on the day of his death was appended to the 1997 DVD release of ''Hated''.

GG Allin's grave was frequently vandalized with urine, feces, cigarette butts, and alcohol by fans,<ref>''Littleton Courier'', June 18, 2009</ref> an act that was greatly discouraged by GG's mother Arleta.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> His tombstone has since been removed because of this.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://swampyacresfarm.com/GGAllinsGrave.html|title=Where is GG Allin's Grave?|access-date=November 5, 2016}}</ref>

[[Hank Williams III]]'s 2008 album ''[[Damn Right, Rebel Proud]]'' features the song "P.F.F.", which features the line "''This song is written and dedicated for GG Allin''" spoken at the beginning.

On December 13, 2018, [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] premiered the 2017 documentary ''GG Allin: All in the Family'' which documented Allin's life, career and death and how his brother and mother were coping with his death 20 years later.<ref>{{cite web|website=Sho.com|
