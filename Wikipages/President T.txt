== Biography ==
President T started his music career as a [[drum and bass]] and [[jungle]] MC, later moving into [[UK garage]] when that began to emerge, and then [[Grimes (musician)|grime]]. President T has credited [[pirate radio]] for allowing him to perfect his craft.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2">{{cite web |url=https://flexfm.co.uk/prez-t-guesting-with-nasty-jack-logan-sama-bekz-monday-28th-january-2200-0000/ |title=» Prez T guesting with Nasty Jack, Logan Sama & Bekz – Monday 28th January – 22:00-00:00 {{!}} FLEX FM 101.4FM |language=en-GB |access-date=2020-01-27}}</ref><ref name=":5" /> President T has family in Manchester and spent some time there for three years in his teens.<ref name=":3" /> In the late 90s, he joined Manchester-based group Darkside Crew alongside Black Tiga, Ms. Shotta, Vane, DJPH1, and Nova & Cautious.<ref name=":2" />

In 2003,<ref name=":6" /> he joined younger brother [[Big H (rapper)|Big H]], cousin Bossman Birdie, as well as [[Skepta]], [[Jme (musician)|Jme]], Pablo, [[Meridian Dan]], and Lieutenant to form Meridian Crew, all of whom were based around the same area in North London.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" /><ref name=":4" />

President T released his debut mixtape, ''Back Inna My Face Volume 1'', in late 2007 for free download.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":6" />

Meridian Crew would end up splitting up. Skepta and Jme went on to form [[Boy Better Know]], while President T joined Bloodline Music alongside former Meridian Crew members; Big H, Pablo, Bossman Birdie and fellow North London MC 9 Milli Major.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":5" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://grmdaily.com/grm-exclusive-president-t-interview |title=GRM EXCLUSIVE: PRESIDENT T ON PRISON, BEING A ROLE MODEL & GRIME'S EVOLUTION |last= |first= |date= |website=GRM Daily – Grime, Rap music and Culture |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706230420/http://grmdaily.com/grm-exclusive-president-t-interview |archive-date=2019-07-06 |access-date=2020-01-27}}</ref>

President T had a lull of activity until a return in 2015, when he dropped a 13-track mixtape titled ''Greatest To Ever Touch Down''.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> This was followed by ''T on The Wing'' in 2016, followed in 2017 by a re-master and re-release of his 2007 mixtape, ''Back Inna My Face''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://hqondemand.com/artists/president-t/ |title=President T |website=HQ On Demand |access-date=2020-01-27}}</ref> In 2018, President T dropped two projects, ''Stranger Returns'' and ''There's Only One''.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":0" /><ref name=":7">{{cite web |url=https://www.clashmusic.com/reviews/president-t-stranger-returns |title=President T – Stranger Returns |website=Clash Magazine |language=en |access-date=2020-01-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190927134315/https://www.clashmusic.com/reviews/president-t-stranger-returns |archive-date=2019-09-27 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In November 2016 he appeared in ''A. Dot's Story of Grime,'' a documentary for BBC Three.<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |date=24 November 2016 |title=BBC Three – A.Dot's Story of Grime – Credits |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04fj2t0 |url-status=live |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=31 October 2020 |website=BBC Three |language=en-GB}}</ref> [[Amplify Dot|A.Dot]] wanted President T to be one of the veteran rappers in the [[Grime (music genre)|grime]] [[Battle rap|clash]] cypher she was trying to set up, and [[Sir Spyro]] who was also in the same studio agreed he should accept the challenge.<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |date=22 November 2016 |title=BBC Three – A.Dot's Story of Grime: Rise of the MC |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4AJD1ALvx0 |url-status=live |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=31 October 2020 |website=Youtube}}</ref> However he declined the offer, just like all the other grime music legends, as they didn't want to risk being the only veterans there.

In December 2016 he appeared in the 2 part Channel 4 documentary ''Pirate Mentality,'' which was co-produced by ''Two Yanks and a Brit UK, Risky Roadz'' and SBTV. He was interviewed briefly in episode 1, along with a short clip of him performing in an old school pirate radio session, which was set up by [[Boy Better Know|Frisco]] and ''Risky Roadz''. His full unedited performance was shown in episode 2.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kpade |first=Sabo |date=23 January 2017 |title='Pirate Mentality' Documents the Beating Heart of Black British Youth Culture |url=https://www.okayafrica.com/pirate-mentality-black-british-youth-culture/ |url-status=live |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=11 November 2020 |website=OkayAfrica |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=O'Brien |first=Frederick |date=13 April 2019 |title=Rhythm Division – the (140 bpm) heart of grime |url=https://romanroadlondon.com/rhythm-division-grime-record-shop-bow/ |url-status=live |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=11 November 2020 |website=Roman Road LDN |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |date= |title=Pirate Mentality – All 4 |url=https://www.channel4.com/programmes/pirate-mentality |url-status=live |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=11 November 2020 |website=www.channel4.com}}</ref>
