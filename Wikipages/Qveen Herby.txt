'''Amy Renee Heidemann''' '''Noonan''' (born April 29, 1986), known by her stage name '''Qveen Herby''',<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.sindhenapp.com/qveenherby/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029121107/https://www.sindhenapp.com/qveenherby/|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 29, 2017|title=Karmin now is Qveen Herby|date=May 30, 2017|work=Sindhen App|access-date=October 29, 2017}}</ref> is an American [[Rapping|rapper]], [[Singing|singer]], [[songwriter]] and entrepreneur. Born and raised in [[Seward, Nebraska]], she first gained fame as part of the music duo [[Karmin]], with whom she released two studio albums. Following the duo's hiatus in 2017, she began the solo project Qveen Herby, which incorporated [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] influences.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=http://1033ampradio.cbslocal.com/2017/05/30/karmin-is-dead-amy-heidemann-ushers-in-her-reign-as-qveen-herby/|title=KARMIN Is Dead! Amy Heidemann Ushers In Her Reign As Qveen Herby|access-date=October 29, 2017}}</ref> She released her first solo extended play, ''[[EP 1 (Qveen Herby EP)|EP 1]]'' on June 2, 2017, preceded by the single "Busta Rhymes". She released her debut album, ''[[A Woman (Qveen Herby album)|A Woman]]'' on May 21, 2021.

== Career ==

=== 2010–2016: Music with Karmin ===
Heidemann began her musical career as a member of pop duo [[Karmin]], with now-husband Nick Noonan, releasing cover songs on [[YouTube]]. The group signed with [[Epic Records]] and released their debut EP, ''[[Hello (Karmin EP)|Hello]]'', on May 7, 2012, to poor reviews from critics; despite this, the EP was a commercial success supplemented by two hit singles: "Brokenhearted" peaked at number 16 on US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] charts, and peaked within the top ten of the charts in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, while "''Hello''" peaked at number one on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] charts in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/music/karmin|title=Karmin|work=Billboard|access-date=October 29, 2017}}</ref>

The duo followed ''Hello'' up by their debut full-length studio album, ''Pulses'' (2014), which saw less commercial success, and was supplemented by the single "[[Acapella (Karmin song)|''Acapella'']]." Following the conclusion of promotion for ''Pulses'', Karmin left Epic Records and began releasing music independently.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6509542/karmin-along-the-road-video-exclusive-interview|title=Exclusive Video Premiere: Karmin Go DIY Video Route for New Single 'Along The Road'|work=Billboard|access-date=October 29, 2017}}</ref> They released a slew of singles from 2014 to 2016 in anticipation of a second studio album. These included "''Sugar''", "''Yesterday''", "[[Along the Road (song)|''Along the Road'']]", "''[[Didn't Know You]]''", and "''[[Come with Me (Pure Imagination)]]''".  In 2016, Karmin released the ''Sugar'' EP in collaboration with Wild Culture. It features three remixes of "''Sugar''" and a remix of Riley Pearce's single "''Brave''". The duo released their second studio album, ''[[Leo Rising]]'', on September 9, 2016.

=== 2017–present: Rebranding as Qveen Herby ===
In 2017, all of Karmin's social media was rebranded to Qveen Herby and a small preview stating "''Karmin Is Dead, Long Live the Qveen.''" was posted. Noonan formally announced her solo career as well as her debut extended play, ''[[EP 1 (Qveen Herby EP)|EP 1]]''.<ref name=":2" /> Although her husband Nick was still involved in the project, Noonan noted that they felt that they could not release the extended play as Karmin as "There was that much happening sonically."<ref name=digital>{{cite web |last1=Papadatos |first1=Markos |title=Qveen Herby talks new solo music, digital transformation |url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/entertainment/music/qveen-herby-talks-new-solo-music-digital-transformation/article/498222 |website=Digital Journal |date=22 July 2017 |access-date=August 20, 2019}}</ref> Noonan picked her stage name by combining "Qveen" a nickname given to her in college alongside "Herby" the mascot of the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers]] later realizing that "Herby" means "Warrior".<ref name=digital/> The music video for her first single "Busta Rhymes" was released on June 1, 2017, followed by the release of ''EP 1'' a day later. The EP experienced fair success, peaking at No. 37 on the US Billboard Independent Albums Chart and No. 13 on the US Heatseekers Albums Chart.<ref name=":1" />

Following the release of ''EP 1'', Herby began releasing a series of extended plays, with ''[[EP 2 (Qveen Herby EP)|EP 2]]'' being released in 2017, ''EP3'' and ''EP 4'' in 2018, ''EP 5'', ''EP 6'', ''EP 7'', and ''The Vignettes'' in 2019, and ''Tiny Piano'', ''EP 8'' and ''EP 9'' in 2020. Three of the EPs charted within ''Billboard'' charts in the US. Herby released her debut album ''[[A Woman (Qveen Herby album)|A Woman]]'' on May 21, 2021.
