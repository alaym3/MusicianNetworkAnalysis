'''The Fat Boys''' were an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] trio from [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], that emerged in the early 1980s.<ref name= latimes>{{cite web |url= https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-10-02-ca-7609-story.html |title=Fat Boys: More Here Than Rappin|author=Hunt, Dennis|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]| date=October 2, 1987|access-date=March 25, 2014}}</ref> The group was briefly known originally as the Disco 3, originally composed of Mark "[[Prince Markie Dee]]" Morales, Damon "Kool Rock-Ski" Wimbley, and [[Darren Robinson (rapper)|Darren "Buff Love" Robinson]].

The trio is widely known for using [[beatbox]] in their songs. The group opened doors for beatboxers like [[Biz Markie]] and [[Doug E. Fresh]]. The Fat Boys were one of the first rap groups to release full-length rap albums, along with [[Run-D.M.C.]], [[Whodini]] and [[Kurtis Blow]]. Beloved for their comedic, self-deprecating rhymes, the group released seven studio albums, four of which went [[gold certification|Gold]] by [[RIAA]].

The first two albums of the group were produced by  Kurtis Blow. Successful singles included "Jail House Rap", "Can You Feel It?", "Fat Boys", "Stick 'Em", "Don't You Dog Me", "All You Can Eat", "The Fat Boys Are Back", and "Pump It Up".

The album ''[[Crushin']]'' received a [[platinum certification|Platinum]] status due to their single "[[Wipe Out (song)|Wipeout]]", which was recorded together with the American [[rock music|rock]] group [[The Beach Boys]]. The next album, ''Coming Back Hard Again'', repeated the formula of the previous one and received a [[gold certification|Gold]] status due to the successful single "[[The Twist (song)|The Twist (Yo, Twist)]]", recorded together with American [[rock and roll|rock 'n roll]] singer [[Chubby Checker]]. The album also included the [[theme song]] for the movie ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master]]'', which featured [[Robert Englund]] performing as [[Freddy Krueger]].

The group starred in three [[feature film]]s in the 1980s, thereby strengthening the popularity of hip hop in America: ''[[Krush Groove]]'', ''[[Knights of the City]]'' and ''[[Disorderlies]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://cinapse.co/the-3-films-of-the-fat-boys-knights-of-the-city-1986-krush-groove-1985-disorderlies-1987-1f3323e71a3a|title=The 3 Films Of The Fat Boys: KNIGHTS OF THE CITY (1986), KRUSH GROOVE (1985), DISORDERLIES (1987) (by David Chisholm) September 15, 2015| website=cinapse.co |access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref>

==History==
=== Beginnings===
In 1983, a Swiss-born promoter named Charles Stettler, the owner of his own label Tin Pan Apple, decided to hold a hip-hop talent contest. To find a sponsor, Stettler went to the [[WBLS]] radio station, which recommended him to a couple of sponsors. In the end, he persuaded the company [[Coca-Cola]] to finance the contest. For the next three months, contests were held to identify a winner in each borough of New York City every Saturday afternoon.<ref name="boingboing.net">{{cite web| url= https://boingboing.net/2014/07/01/brain-rot-hip-hop-family-tree-107.html|title=How Disco 3 became The Fat Boys (by ED PISKOR)| website=boingboing.net |access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref>

On May 23, 1983, the final contest entitled "Coca-Cola and WBLS present: The Tin Pan Apple After Dark Dance & Rap Contest!" was held. The event was held at [[Radio City Music Hall]].<ref>{{cite web| url= https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1741/5543/products/1434555657-h_1024x@2x.jpg?v=1514998079|title=FAT BOYS (CD AND LP BUNDLE) (2012)| website= cdn.shopify.com |access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref> The host that evening was [[Mr. Magic]] from the radio program ''Rap Attack''. According to the terms of the competition, the winner signed a contract for a recording contract. The Fat Boys members, then calling themselves The Disco 3, were unexpected winners<ref name=latimes/> with their song "Stick' Em".<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.complex.com/music/2012/07/when-the-fat-boys-were-fly|title=When The Fat Boys Were Fly| first= Michael A. | last= Gonzales | date= July 12, 2012| website= complex.com |access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref>

=== European Tour ===
In 1983, The Disco 3 released their debut single "Reality". It was produced by James Mason, jazz guitarist and keyboardist of [[Roy Ayers]]' jazz-funk band.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.discogs.com/The-Disco-3-Reality/master/85484|title=The Disco 3 – Reality| website=discogs.com |access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref>

Since the group did not have a manager, Stettler took over this position. Stettler took the group on a European bus tour, where he told them to gain more weight. The concerts ended at 12 o'clock in the evening, and they could not get to the hotel until two o'clock in the morning. Only places like [[McDonald's]] and [[Burger King]] were open, so the group members gained weight from this. Since so much was happening, the group members did not even notice this on the tour and did not consider themselves overweight. <ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.vibe.com/2010/10/fat-boys-kool-rock-talks-tv-ones-unsung-weightloss-fat-stereotypes| title=The Fat Boys' Kool Rock Talks TV One's Unsung, Weightloss, Fat Stereotypes| author= GangStarr Girl | date= October 18, 2010| website=vibe.com |access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref> A party was later held for the renaming of the group at the [[Roseland Ballroom]] in New York.

=== Meeting Kurtis Blow ===
Charlie Stettler introduced the group to rapper and producer [[Kurtis Blow]], who helped them find their signature sound.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://firstwefeast.com/eat/2016/04/fat-boys-all-you-can-eat-oral-history|title=An Oral History of the Fat Boys' 'All You Can Eat' Music Video| first= Ryan | last= Joseph | date= April 26, 2016| website= firstwefeast.com |access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref> To work on the album, Kurtis Blow recruited the [[drum machine]] programmers of [[Run-D.M.C.]], [[Larry Smith (producer)|Larry Smith]] and [[Davy DMX|Davy "DMX" Reeves]], who were considered two of the best at making songs at the time. "Stick' Em" was the first song they recorded with Kurtis Blow.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://slate.com/culture/2012/07/fat-boys-debut-album-re-issued-why-the-rap-group-still-matters.html|title=Why the Fat Boys still matter| first= Dave | last=Tompkins | date= July 11, 2012| website= slate.com |access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref>

The group's 1984 self-titled debut album, ''[[Fat Boys (album)|Fat Boys]]'', is considered by many to be the first hip-hop album to feature such the element known as [[beatbox]]. Darren "The Human Beat Box" Robinson was a pioneer in beatboxing. 

=== Fresh Fest Tour '84 ===
One day in 1984, [[Russell Simmons]] stormed into Stettler's office and told him that he was going to have a festival titled Fresh Fest Tour '84, in which his groups and breakdancers would take part. Since Stettler raised $300,000 from [[Coca-Cola]] to finance his 1983 contest, Simmons wanted Stettler to do it again. The young promoter could not get the beverage company to return, so he called a friend of his and asked him if there was anything the Swiss were trying to sell. The [[Swatch]] wristwatch turned out to be such a product. Stettler persuaded the company to finance a tour of $360,000, while the festival was renamed The Swatch Watch New York City Fresh Fest.

Russell Simmons did not want to take The Fat Boys on the tour, because nobody had heard of them at that point. Stettler went to an old Tower Records store on Broadway and handed out 5,000 flyers that read: "Guess the weight of The Fat Boys and the person who does wins 800 cans of [[Diet Pepsi]] and one dollar". Thousands of children lined up at the Tower Records store to participate. Stettler put the group members on the scale; at that time they weighed {{cvt|868|lb|kg}} together. In the end, a boy from [[Harlem]] won. Channel 2 News filmed this event, including the delivery of the soda pop. 

The next day, Stettler saw in the newspaper that [[The Jackson 5]] was going to be reuniting at a concert in October 1984. He called his wife and part-time partner, asking her to write a press release saying that The Jackson 5 have picked the then still unknown group The Fat Boys as their opening act. Stettler distributed this press release across the city. The next morning, Stettler and The Fat Boys appeared on the TV show ''[[Good Morning America]]''. When the host turned around to The Fat Boys, they did not know what to say. They simply said: "Brrr, Stick' Em! Ha-ha-ha, Stick 'Em!", due to it being the group's popular song at the time.<ref name="boingboing.net"/>

Russell Simmons agreed to add The Fat Boys to the lineup of the festival, which included Run-D.M.C., Kurtis Blow, [[Whodini]], [[Newcleus]], and The Dynamic Breakers.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1984/11/29/hip-hop-to-freshness/63f9dadd-1bd5-43b4-90f9-20198b98f85f/?noredirect=on|title=Hip-Hop to Freshness | first= J.D. | last= Considine |date=November 29, 1984| website=washingtonpost.com |access-date= 2019-03-03}}</ref> The first concert of the tour took place on [[Labor Day]], September 3, 1984.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=iyQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT49|title= Information| work= Billboard | page= 49 |date= April 20, 1985| via=Google Books |access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref> For 27 concerts in the United States, the organizers raised $3.5 million.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://boingboing.net/2014/12/16/fresh-fest-84.html|title=Fresh Fest '84| first= Ed| last= Piskor| website=boingboing.net |access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref> The festival was accompanied by advertising on television.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYbOQZvPNFM|title=NYC Fresh Fest commercial 1984| website=youtube.com |access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sG-tUsz-j0|title=All American White Boy-Steve Glavin-Swatch World Breakdance| website=youtube.com |access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref>

In 1985, this was followed by Fresh Fest II, which included the same acts, with [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]] replacing Newcleus.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://chroniclesofharriet.com/2014/03/18/fresh-fest|title=THE FRESH FEST OF AFROFUTURISM!| website=chroniclesofharriet.com |access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref>

=== Film & Television===
At the time, the American office of the company [[Swatch]] was tasked with trying to advertise their product to American audiences. The company was known for using offbeat campaigns, and agreed to feature the Fat Boys in a commercial for the watches on [[MTV]]. The video "Brrr, Swatch ’Em!" was aired in December 1984.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCGUyh1Pjw0|title=1984 - Swatch - The Fat Boys Commercial December 31, 1984| website=youtube.com |access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref> Swatch again featured The Fat Boys in a 1985 Christmas advertisement created by former MTV creative heads [[Alan Goodman]] and [[Fred Seibert]]. This commercial, "Swatch Watch Presents A Merry Christmas" was first broadcast in December 1985.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://fredalan.org/post/845548206/the-fats-boys-for-swatch|title=The Fats Boys for Swatch. - Director: Alan Goodman | website=fredalan.org |access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= http://nightflight.com/the-fat-boys-wipeout-east-coast-rap-and-west-coast-surf-rock-battle-it-out-in-a-memorable-1987-video|title=The Fat Boys’ “Wipeout”: East coast rap and West coast surf rock battle it out in a memorable 1987 video (by Bryan Thomas) on July 2, 2016| website=nightflight.com |access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref> These commercials were notable, because when they aired in December 1984, MTV did not feature many hip-hop artists in their programming, having only started airing music videos from rap artists earlier that year with Run-D.M.C.’s crossover hit, “[[Rock Box]].” Due to the success of these commercials, they would become frequent guests on MTV, pioneering a space for hip-hop artists to appear on the network and ultimately increasing hip hop's popularity and legitimacy with MTV's audience. <ref>{{cite web| url= http://nightflight.com/the-fat-boys-wipeout-east-coast-rap-and-west-coast-surf-rock-battle-it-out-in-a-memorable-1987-video|title=The Fat Boys’ “Wipeout”: East coast rap and West coast surf rock battle it out in a memorable 1987 video (by Bryan Thomas) on July 2, 2016| website=nightflight.com |access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref>

Also because of these commercials, the group developed a reputation for their sense of humor. They starred in several [[feature film]]s. Their first starring role came in the movie ''[[Krush Groove]]'' (1985), followed by a second, ''[[Disorderlies]]'' (1987), which also featured [[Ralph Bellamy]] as a millionaire invalid cared for by his good-natured yet inept [[orderly|orderlies]] (played by the Fat Boys), with a cameo by manager Stettler.

=== Making "Crushin" & "Coming Back Hard Again" ===
Hoping to repeat the success of [[Run-D.M.C.]] and [[Aerosmith]] with the single "[[Walk This Way]]" The Fat Boys made a [[cover version]] of the song "[[Wipe Out (song)|Wipeout]]" together with [[rock music|rock]] group [[The Beach Boys]]. The single peaked at number 12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.billboard.com/music/fat-boys/chart-history/hot-100/song/332037|title=Fat Boys & The Beach Boys - Wipeout - Billboard Chart History - Hot 100| website=billboard.com |access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref> and number 10 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.billboard.com/music/fat-boys/chart-history/r-b-hip-hop-songs/song/369329|title=Fat Boys & The Beach Boys - Wipeout - Billboard Chart History - Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs| website=billboard.com |access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref> The song "Wipeout" reached #2 on [[UK Singles Chart|UK Top 100]] in September 1987 during a 13-week chart run.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/24429/fat-boys-and-the-beach-boys|title=FAT BOYS & THE BEACH BOYS - Official Singles Chart (22 August 1987)| website=officialcharts.com |access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref> "Wipeout" was the last song the group members recorded for the album ''[[Crushin']]".

The music video for the song begins with an announcement of a boxing match, The Fat Boys and The Beach Boys are attending the match. The match is interrupted by a fight. In the following scene, The Fat Boys load up a car with swimsuits and then drive off. The Beach Boys are driving in a dune buggy through the city. Both bands go around the city in the direction of a beach, while they perform the song and invite the inhabitants of the city to come to the beach. Meanwhile, at the beach one of The Fat Boys tries to lift a heavy weight and is laughed at by two women because of failure, another playing volleyball and another surfing. The Beach Boys on the other hand are DJing in the street. At the end of the video they all celebrate at a beach party.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8300176/|title=Fat Boys Feat. The Beach Boys: Wipeout (1987)| website=imdb.com |access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref>

The group was later approached to record the [[theme song]] for ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master]]'' (1988), called "[[Are You Ready for Freddy]]", which featured [[Robert Englund]] performing as [[Freddy Krueger]].

Their next album called ''[[Coming Back Hard Again]]'' repeated the formula of the previous one. This time, The Fat Boys recorded a cover version of the song "[[The Twist (song)|The Twist]]" with [[Chubby Checker]], who performed it originally in 1960. The single peaked at number 16 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.billboard.com/music/fat-boys/chart-history/hot-100/song/331864|title=The Fat Boys - The Twist - Billboard Chart History - Hot 100| website=billboard.com |access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref> and number 40 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.billboard.com/music/fat-boys/chart-history/r-b-hip-hop-songs/song/331864|title=The Fat Boys - The Twist - Billboard Chart History - Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs| website=billboard.com |access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref> The song "The Twist (Yo, Twist)" reached number two on [[UK Singles Chart|UK Top 100]] in July 1988 during a 11-week chart run.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/24979/fat-boys-with-chubby-checker|title=FAT BOYS WITH CHUBBY CHECKER - Official Singles Chart (18 June 1988)| website=officialcharts.com |access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref> Another song from the album, "[[Louie Louie]]", is a cover version of a 1957 song by American singer [[Richard Berry (musician)|Richard Berry]]. The song peaked at number 46 on [[UK Singles Chart|UK Top 100]] on November 5, 1988 for 4 weeks.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/louie,-louie|title=FAT BOYS - LOUIE, LOUIE - Official Singles Chart (5 November 1988)| website=officialcharts.com |access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref>

=== Breakup ===
However, the tastes of the listeners at that time had already changed. By taking part in the rash rap opera ''On And On'', the group tried to regain its fame, but this only accelerated the breakup of the group.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.last.fm/ru/music/Fat+Boys/+wiki|title=The Fat Boys on Last.fm| website=last.fm |access-date=2019-02-14}}</ref> Prince Markie Dee left the group in 1990 to pursue [[solo (music)|solo]] interests, which included producing many early tracks for [[Mariah Carey]] and [[Mary J. Blige]] which included her debut single, "[[Real Love (Mary J. Blige song)|Real Love]]". In 1991, the remaining two members, Kool Rock-Ski and Buff Love, carried on as a [[duet (music)|duo]] and released ''Mack Daddy'' (1991), but shortly thereafter, the group disbanded (until 2008). In the 1992 feature film ''[[Boomerang (1992 film)|Boomerang]]'', [[Chris Rock]]'s character laments the breakup of the Fat Boys. He was later quoted by [[Jay Z|Jay-Z]] in his 2001 song the "Heart of the City (Ain't No Love)".

=== Aftermath ===
On December 10, 1995, Buff Love died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] during a bout with respiratory flu in [[Rosedale, Queens]], New York. He was 28 years old and reportedly weighed {{convert|450|lb|kg}}.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/13/arts/darren-robinson-fat-boys-rapper-28.html|title=Darren Robinson, Fat Boys Rapper, 28 (December 13, 1995)| website=nytimes.com |access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref>

The surviving members of the Fat Boys launched [http://www.OriginalFatBoys.com its first official homepage], OriginalFatBoys.com, on November 5, 2008. According to the website, the Fat Boys recorded their first track in nearly two decades and had plans of doing a reality TV show in search of a new member.<ref name=Original>[http://www.OriginalFatBoys.com OriginalFatBoys.com]</ref>

In March 2009, Kool Rock-Ski announced the launch of his official website, [https://archive.today/20130127230047/http://www.koolrockski.com/ KoolRockSki.com]. His first solo project, the EP ''Party Time'', was released on April 14, 2009.

On October 18, 2010, the cable network [[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]]'s aired ''Unsung: The Story of The Fat Boys''. It mentioned that the two surviving members reunited and were touring with [[Doug E. Fresh]] who was providing the beatboxing. There has been no confirmation as to whether he is the new third permanent member. The special was produced by the group's manager, Louis Gregory, publicly known as Uncle Louie.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://vimeo.com/306722611 |title=Unsung - The Fat Boys| website=vimeo.com|access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref>

In August 2012, The Fat Boys were scheduled to perform at the 13th annual [[Gathering of the Juggalos]] in [[Cave-In-Rock, Illinois]] but ultimately failed to appear.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.avclub.com/article/strange-times-at-the-2012-gathering-of-the-juggalo-83814 |title=Strange times at the 2012 Gathering Of The Juggalos (by Nathan Rabin) August 14, 2012 | website=avclub.com|access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref>

Prince Markie Dee died of a suspected heart attack on February 18, 2021, the day before his 53rd birthday; according to TMZ, Morales had gone to the hospital complaining of chest pains. It was determined a stent was needed to clear blockage in his heart, but Morales died before the stent could be inserted.

Prince Markie Dee was a radio host for [[WEDR]] 99 Jamz in [[Miami]], [[Florida]] working weekends while Kool Rock-Ski is last known to have been residing in New York, and is the last surviving Fat Boy.
