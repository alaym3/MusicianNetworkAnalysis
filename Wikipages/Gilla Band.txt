'''Gilla Band''' (formerly '''Girl Band''') are an Irish [[post-punk]] and [[noise rock]] band from [[Dublin]] formed in 2011. The line-up comprises childhood friends Dara Kiely (vocals) and Alan Duggan (guitar), with Daniel Fox (bass) and Adam Faulkner (drums).

Their career began with the 2012 single "In My Head", followed by the track "You're a Dog", which lead to them developing live followings in both Ireland and the UK, and a [[recording contract]] with [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]] in 2015. That year ''[[The Irish Times]]'' described them as "the most fascinating act out of these parts at present...[who make] thrilling, menacing, exciting noise".<ref name="it" />

To date they have released a series of singles and EPs,<ref>{{cite web|last=O'Toole|first=Lucy|title=Girl Band Reflect On Their Incredible Comeback With The Talkies|url=https://www.hotpress.com/music/girl-band-reflect-incredible-comeback-talkies-22799235|access-date=2021-06-21|website=Hotpress}}</ref> the critically acclaimed album ''[[Holding Hands with Jamie]]'' (2015) and, after a gap in 2016-7 due to health issues, the [[techno]] and [[glam rock|glam]] influenced ''[[The Talkies]]'' (2019).

== History ==
===  Early years ===

In April 2012 they released their debut single "In My Head" on Any Other City Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/girl-band-mn0003066214/biography|title=Girl Band Biography & History AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2017-01-08}}</ref> They self-financed a music video for the track "Leave Again".<ref>{{cite web|title=Harrows "Leave Again"|date=2008-11-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ynwDS5OHU|website=[[YouTube]]|access-date=2017-01-18}}</ref> Kiely played drums in Harrows and it was not until after Harrows disbanded that he attempted singing.<ref name=":4" />

The band followed the single with the self-produced ''France 98'' EP which was recorded live and released through Any Other City. They then recorded a cover of "[[Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage?]]" by [[techno]] artist [[Blawan]],<ref name="Records">{{cite web|url=http://www.roughtraderecords.com/news/girl_band_announce_the_early_years_12_ep_first_ever_us_tour_dates_share_video_for_why_they_hide_their_bodies|title=Rough Trade Records|last=Records|first=Rough Trade|website=Rough Trade Records|access-date=2017-01-08}}</ref> which furthered their reputation and expanded their fan base, setting them up for a handful of UK tour dates throughout April 2013.<ref name=":1" />

=== Rough Trade ===
Girl Band released a number of  limited 7" singles throughout 2014 on Any Other City records, and in December 2014 signed to [[Rough Trade Records]].<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://www.roughtraderecords.com/news/rough_trade_sign_girl_band|title=Rough Trade Records|last=Records|first=Rough Trade|website=Rough Trade Records|access-date=2017-01-08}}</ref> The record deal came about after the founder of the label, [[Geoff Travis]] saw them perform numerous times,<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":7" /> and he wanted to "facilitate what [the band was] doing [at the time] on a bigger scale".<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":0" /> They were given full creative control and allowed to produce their own records.<ref name=":3" /> They released their self-produced debut album ''Holding Hands With Jamie'' on Rough Trade in September 2015.<ref>{{Citation|title=Holding Hands With Jamie by Girl Band|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/holding-hands-with-jamie/girl-band|access-date=2017-01-08}}</ref>

In June 2019, Girl Band released "Shoulderblades", their first single in four years.<ref name="talkies">{{cite web |title=Girl Band Announce New Album The Talkies, Share Video for New Song "Shoulderblades": Watch |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/girl-band-announce-new-album-the-talkies-share-video-for-new-song-shoulderblades-watch/ |website=Pitchfork |date=6 June 2019 |access-date=11 June 2019 |language=en}}</ref> A second single titled "Going Norway" followed in August 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://store.roughtraderecords.com/products/girl-band-going-norway-7|title=Girl Band - Going Norway 7|first=Rough Trade|last=Records|website=Rough Trade Records}}</ref> The songs are the singles for the band's second album ''[[The Talkies]]'', which was released by Rough Trade on 27 September.<ref name="talkies"/> The album's repetitive and experimental sound is characterized by its unorthodox use of effects-laden guitars, abstract [[stream of consciousness]] lyrics and stylistic borrowings from [[techno]] & [[Industrial music|industrial]] music.<ref>{{cite web|last=O'Toole|first=Lucy|title=Girl Band Reflect On Their Incredible Comeback With The Talkies|url=https://www.hotpress.com/music/girl-band-reflect-incredible-comeback-talkies-22799235|access-date=2020-12-25|website=Hotpress}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> Critics have described the album as [[noise rock]]<ref name=":1">{{cite web|date=2019-09-19|title=Girl Band – 'The Talkies' review|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/girl-band-the-talkies-album-review-2550801|access-date=2020-12-25|website=NME {{!}} Music, Film, TV, Gaming & Pop Culture News|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{cite web|date=2019-09-27|title=Girl Band: The Talkies review|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/27/girl-band-the-talkies-review|access-date=2020-12-25|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref> & post-punk,<ref name=":3">{{cite web|date=2019-10-01|title=Girl Band: The Talkies|url=https://spectrumculture.com/2019/09/30/girl-band-the-talkies-review/|access-date=2021-06-21|website=Spectrum Culture|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":2" /> with many praising its dark and unsettling tone.

=== Name change ===
In November 2021, the band announced they were changing their name from Girl Band to Gilla Band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/CWVZKovsx2_/ |title=Gilla Band on Instagram: “We are changing our band name. We are also playing some shows in Dublin in January. Mailing list sign up link in bio” |publisher=Instagram.com |date=2021-11-16 |access-date=2021-11-27}}</ref>

== Style ==
The band's debut album was well received by music critics. [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] said that "Dara Kiely brings heavy vibes and great songs to Girl Band's new album. Should you laugh? ''Holding Hands With Jamie'' is as discomfiting as Kiely’s mental state".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21029-holding-hands-with-jamie/|title=Girl Band: Holding Hands With Jamie Album Review {{!}} Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|access-date=2017-01-10}}</ref> [[The Guardian]] described the band as "full of sound and fury" and stated "This Irish four-piece howls at you from the very start, an unbroken series of thumping, crashing songs strewn with fractured, imagistic lyrics".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/17/girl-band-holding-hands-with-jamie-review|title=Girl Band: Holding Hands with Jamie review – thumping, crashing sound and fury from Dublin punks|last=MacInnes|first=Paul|date=2015-12-17|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2017-01-10}}</ref>

[[Rolling Stone]] wrote than Kiely's vocal performance "sure sounds convincing. But he doesn't seem too shy about it, either – less like someone cowering embarrassedly in his room than a guy who's turned his fish-belly skin and concave abs into a creepy point of pride. That kind of confrontational, matter-of-fact ugliness is what this Irish post-punk crew does so well, torturing their instruments with dead-eyed precision and diabolical resolve. The dank, relentless music sounds like it was recorded in a meat locker under a fallout shelter". Rolling Stone compared the band to [[Liars (band)|Liars]] and [[Nick Cave|Nick Cave's]] [[The Birthday Party (band)|Birthday Party]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/girl-band-holding-hands-with-jamie-20151016|title=Girl Band 'Holding Hands With Jamie' Album Review|newspaper=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-01-10}}</ref>

=== Influences ===
Drummer Adam Faulkner has said that "most of the bands we get compared to we don’t really listen to. For ages, for like a whole year, we got compared to [[Mclusky]], and none of us ever listened to it. And then we all did and were just like, Nah, don’t like it."<ref name=":7"/> The band's influences include [[Bad Brains]],<ref name=":2" /> [[James Chance and the Contortions]],<ref name=":2" /> [[Neu!]],<ref name=":2" /> and [[The Chemical Brothers]].<ref name=":2" />
