'''Pepper''' is a three-piece [[reggae rock]] band originally from [[Hawaii]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://zildjian.com/Artists/W/Yesod-Williams|title=Artists who use Zildjian Cymbals|website=Zildjian}}</ref> now based in [[San Diego]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pepperlive.com/bio |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-07-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725043909/http://pepperlive.com/bio/ |archive-date=2010-07-25 }}</ref> The band consists of vocalist/guitarist [[Kaleo Wassman]], vocalist/bassist Bret Bollinger, and drummer [[Yesod Williams]].  Since the band's formation they have released eight studio albums, as well as two live albums.

==Band history==
===1996–2001: Formation===
Pepper formed in 1996 with singer/guitarist [[Kaleo Wassman]] and bassist/singer Bret Bollinger, who had been friends since middle school.<ref name="sing365.com">{{Cite web |url=http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Pepper-Biography/22696BE45B2F8CE348256E2B0011C62F |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006043426/http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Pepper-Biography/22696BE45B2F8CE348256E2B0011C62F |archive-date=2011-10-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The duo was influenced by the Hawaiian artist [[Three Plus]] and popular mainland groups like [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]]. The group struggled to find a drummer to be in the band, with Wassman stating, "We were going through drummers like a bottomless pit."<ref name="sing365.com"/> Wassman and Bollinger heard about a drummer named [[Yesod Williams]] who had gained success around their small town, and later met Williams at a party.<ref name="sing365.com"/><ref name="mtv.com">{{Cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/pepper/artist.jhtml |title=Archived copy |website=[[MTV]] |access-date=2009-09-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027064411/http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/pepper/artist.jhtml |archive-date=2009-10-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The two convinced Williams to join the band, and they had to come up with a band name. 

In an interview with ''The Pier'', Wassman said "We are three kids in High School in [[Kailua-Kona, Hawaii]]. We're all waiters. We always use to get out of work around ten o'clock at night and then I would race home to watch ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. This was back in the 90's when you had all of these All-stars. There was a skit that they kept re-doing and it was called 'The Pepper Boy'. And, basically its this Italian Restaurant and these 'Pepper Boys' come up to the table, usually to a couple on an exclusive date, and they would come over and OBSCENELY crack pepper all over the woman's plate. It was so funny to us watching the date get so angry and of course the lady just loving the Italian affection. It was one thing the three of us would talk about the next day in Bret's (Bollinger) garage when we were rehearsing and we would just lose it, so we said Pepper for short".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thepier.org/interview-pepper-2/|title = Interview: Pepper}}</ref>

With the trio and new name in place, Pepper left [[Hawaii]] for [[San Diego]] and went on to open shows by [[Burning Spear]], [[Shaggy (musician)|Shaggy]], and other major [[reggae]] artists. 

Pepper first entered the studio in 1997 and recorded a seven-song demo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pepperlive.com/bio/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-06-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621102026/http://pepperlive.com/bio/ |archive-date=2011-06-21 }}</ref>

In 1999, after gathering a small local following on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]], Pepper gained the interest of an independent, [[Los Angeles, California|L.A.]]-based record company, [[Volcom Entertainment]]. Volcom produced and distributed the band's debut release, ''[[Give'n It]]'', which combined [[dancehall]], [[reggae]], [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]], and [[Pop music|pop]] genres and the band made it on the 2001 [[Vans Warped Tour]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pepperlive.com/bio.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-09-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091006021813/http://www.pepperlive.com/bio.htm |archive-date=2009-10-06 }}</ref>

===2002–2005: ''Kona Town'', ''In With the Old'', and mainstream success===

After years of extensive touring, Pepper took to the studio with [[Steve Kravac]] ([[Less Than Jake]], [[MXPX]]) to record their second album entitled ''[[Kona Town]]'', released in March 2002. The track "Give It Up" was released as a single. The album peaked at #2 on the Billboard Reggae Albums chart.

Pepper continued to tour throughout 2003 and into 2004, including dates with [[311 (band)|311]] and [[Snoop Dogg]], along with appearances at the annual [[Bob Marley]] Birthday celebration, [[San Diego]]'s Festival "Street Scene", and a U.S. tour with [[Slightly Stoopid]].<ref name="mtv.com"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/10649.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-09-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002095938/http://www.livedaily.com/news/10649.html |archive-date=2008-10-02 }}</ref>

In March 2004, Pepper released ''[[In With The Old]]'', and got to #34 on the [[Billboard chart|Billboard Heat Seekers]] and #18 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart. The album was recorded at 311's completely analog Hive Studios by board master Ron St. Germain ([[Bad Brains]], [[Living Colour]], [[311 (band)|311]], [[Tool (band)|Tool]], [[Sonic Youth]], [[Soundgarden]]), the album showcases a broader range of influences shared by the trio. The band added punk keyboardist/producer [[Ronnie King]] on the album as well.

===2006–2009: ''No Shame'', ''Pink Crustaceans and Good Vibrations''===
Beginning on July 20, 2006, Pepper supported 311 along with [[The Wailers (1963&ndash;1974 band)|The Wailers]] on their U.S. tour. In August 2006, [[Jägermeister]] announced that Pepper & [[Slightly Stoopid]] would headline the annual [[Jägermeister Musictour]] through December 2006.

The band released their fourth album (and minor label debut) entitled ''[[No Shame (Pepper album)|No Shame]]'' on October 3, 2006. With Ronnie King on keyboard again, it features production from [[Nick Hexum]] of 311, [[Tony Kanal]] of [[No Doubt]], and [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]] producer/[[Butthole Surfers]] member [[Paul Leary]]. A music video was shot for the single "No Control", which became their first commercial single. The album made it to #96 on the ''[[Billboard 200]]'' chart.

On March 20, 2007, Pepper released ''[[To Da Max]]: Mistakes and Outtakes (1997–2004)'', their first compilation album containing rare and B-side tracks.

Pepper appeared on all dates of the 2007 [[Vans Warped Tour]]. They toured with [[The Expendables (American band)|The Expendables]] and [[Passafire]], on their "That's Where I Wanna Be..." 42-stop tour from October to December 2007.

[[File:Kaleowassman4.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kaleo Wassman]] of Pepper performing at Warped Tour in 2007.]]

Pepper released their fifth album on July 22, 2008, titled ''[[Pink Crustaceans and Good Vibrations]]'' on their own label, LAW Records. The cover and title was a play on one of their favorite films [[National Lampoon's Club Dread]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/14166.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-05-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512031816/http://livedaily.com/news/14166.html |archive-date=2008-05-12 }}</ref> The album peaked at #83 on the ''[[Billboard 200]]'' chart.

To promote this release, the band toured across the United States in 2008 from March through April with [[Redeye Empire]] and [[Iration]]. A European tour in support of [[Flogging Molly]] followed, including shows in Germany, Sweden, France, Italy and more. From August 1, 2008 to September 6, 2008, the band toured the U.S. on the Tailgate 2008 Summer Tour. The band then toured with [[Slightly Stoopid]] and Sly & Robbie. The band also headlined the "LAW Records" tour in October 2008 along with [[Passafire]], and [[The Supervillains]]. This was their first tour consisting of only LAW Records bands. After a UK tour with [[Less than Jake]], and a break in December, Pepper, Passafire, and The Supervillains toured the Northwest to complete the first LAW Records tour.

On April 21, 2009, the band released a greatest hits album called ''Kona Gold''. It featured 19-tracks of Pepper's most popular songs. 

The Spring 2009 line-up of the [[Jägermeister Music Tour]] featured Pepper with longtime staples on the punk scene, [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/15667.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-02-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216121047/http://livedaily.com/news/15667.html |archive-date=2009-02-16 }}</ref> Pepper returned to the [[Jägermeister Music Tour]] after a 2006 outing with punk-reggae rockers [[Slightly Stoopid]].

==Other projects==

In 2016, Pepper tried their hands as [[winemaking]] with their own wine collection based on their album titles and cover artwork. The first bottle they released was, "Kona Town Original Blend", which sold quickly. 

In 2017, Pepper partnered up with award-winning [[winemaker]] Thomas Booth, a.k.a. "The Wine Boss" of [[Paso Robles, California]]. Their second bottle, "Blend 2" won Gold at the [[San Francisco Chronicle]] Competition in 2019. They also have a 2017 "Skullconut Malbec", and a 2015 [[Cabernet Sauvignon|Cabernet]] called, "In With The Cab", which is a play off their album, ''In With The Old''. For two years in a row, they've won Gold, Silver and Bronze for all of their wines.<ref name="ThePier">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thepier.org/pepper-the-wine-boss-make-their-no-shame-chardonnay-available/|title = Pepper & the Wine Boss Make Their No Shame Chardonnay Available}}</ref>

Kaleo Wassman explains, "We didn't want to just license our name to the wine, we wanted to be active in the creation of it. And so it's really incredible for us to get these awards and accolades because we are being able to co-create this wine with Thomas." They look to add to their success with the release of "No Shame Chardonnay" with artwork based on their 2006 album, ''No Shame''.<ref name="ThePier" />
