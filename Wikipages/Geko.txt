'''Geko''' were a [[gothic rock]] duo based in [[Los Angeles]]. Formed in 1983, the band's nucleus comprised vocalist/bassist Sarah Folkman and guitarist Carrie McNinch. They released one full-length album, titled ''[[Join My Pretty World]]'', in 1992 before disbanding.<ref name="maximumrocknroll">{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RnJbAAAAMAAJ |title=Geko: ''Join My Pretty World'' |journal=[[Maximumrocknroll]] |publisher=Maximumrocknroll |date=1994 |issue=129 |access-date=July 30, 2020}}</ref>

==History==
Geko was formed in 1983 by Sarah Folkman and Carrie McNinch, who were roommates and attending school at the time. Both were influenced by early [[death rock]], [[rockabilly]] and [[punk rock]]. After a few years of performing live, the band recorded a six-song demo in the late eighties. The band issued their first proper release, the ''"Probing the Gash in Her Head'' 7", in 1991 for Open Records.

Produced with the help of prominent [[Los Angeles]] producer [[Earle Mankey]], the band issued their sole full-length album ''[[Join My Pretty World]]'' in 1992. The album compiled previously recorded tracks with new recordings. Ned Raggett of [[allmusic]] called the band "sharply powerful" and the album was "rough, industrial-strength darkwave music that easily bears repeated listening."<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |first=Ned |last=Raggett |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=mw0000696653|pure_url=yes}}|title=Geko: ''Join My Pretty World'' > Review |publisher=Allmusic |access-date=October 23, 2016}}</ref>

The duo dissolved shortly after the release of their debut album. McNinch abandoned the music scene and began publishing comic zines including ''The Assassin and the Whiner'', and ''Food Geek''. Her mini comic ''You Don't Get There From Here'' is still being published regularly. McNinch also has work included in various anthologies, including ''QU33R'', ''[[No Straight Lines: Four Decades of Queer Comics]]'', ''Runner Runner'', ''Tablegedden'' and multiple issues of ''Not My Small Diary''. Her book ''I Want Everything to be Okay'' was published by Tugboat Press. [[Sarah Folkman]] collaborated with a number of bands, including Spiderworks, [[Vampire Rodents]] and [[proGREX.iv]], before joining the [[trip hop]] band [[THC (band)|THC]] in 1997. She has since gained some recognition as a visual artist and illustrator.<ref name="sarahfolkmanint2012">{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Fox |url=http://alien2sullaterra.blogspot.com/2012/06/interview-with-sarah-folkman-from-geko.html |title=Interview with Sarah Folkman from Geko |publisher=A Kiss in the Dreamhouse: Goth/Industrial/EBM |date=June 2012 |access-date=October 23, 2016}}</ref><ref name="sonicboomhellbent">{{cite journal|first=Chris |last=Christian |url=http://www.sonic-boom.com/review/progrex.iv-1.html |title=proGREX.iv: ''Reinvention Operation'' |journal=Sonic Boom |date=November 1997 |volume=5 |issue=10 |access-date=October 25, 2016}}</ref>
