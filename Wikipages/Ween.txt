'''Ween''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[New Hope, Pennsylvania]], formed in 1984 by [[Gene Ween|Aaron Freeman]] and [[Dean Ween|Mickey Melchiondo]], better known by their respective stage names, Gene and Dean Ween. Generally categorized as an [[alternative rock]] band, the band are known for their highly eclectic catalog of songs inspired by [[funk]], [[soul music|soul]], [[country music|country]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[progressive rock|prog]], [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]], [[rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[punk rock]], and countless more. 

Ween self-released several [[Cassette tape|cassette]] albums from their formation until 1989. Afterward, they put out three officially-released [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]] albums: ''[[GodWeenSatan: The Oneness]]'' (1990); ''[[The Pod]]'' (1991); and ''[[Pure Guava]]'' (1992). For ''Pure Guava'', the band signed with major label [[Elektra Records]]. The album spawned the single "[[Push th' Little Daisies]]", which was a chart hit in Australia and the United States. Under Elektra, the band released four professionally-recorded albums: ''[[Chocolate and Cheese]]'' (1994); ''[[12 Golden Country Greats]]'' (1996); ''[[The Mollusk]]'' (1997); and ''[[White Pepper]]'' (2000). They later returned to independent labels for their albums ''[[Quebec (album)|Quebec]]'' (2003) and ''[[La Cucaracha (album)|La Cucaracha]]'' (2007). After a 28-year run, Freeman quit the band in 2012, citing the need to focus on his alcohol and drug addiction issues. Ween reformed in late 2015 and toured extensively with no stated plans to release new recorded material.<ref>{{Citation |title=Ween Tour Dates |publisher=Ween.com |url=http://ween.com |access-date=December 9, 2015}}</ref><ref name="wbur.org">{{cite web|last1=Sullivan|first1=Jim|title=With The Dean Ween Group, Mickey Melchiondo Continues Creating Jarring Quilts Of Sound|url=http://www.wbur.org/artery/2017/01/10/dean-ween-group|website=Wbur.org|access-date=September 25, 2018}}</ref>

For their first ten years of existence, Ween performed live as a duo backed by a [[Digital Audio Tape]]. With the release of ''Chocolate and Cheese'', they expanded to a four-piece act, later adding a fifth member as well. Their live members include [[Claude Coleman Jr.]], [[Dave Dreiwitz]], and [[Glenn McClelland]]. Ween also collaborated extensively with [[Andrew Weiss (guitarist)|Andrew Weiss]], who joined the band as a bassist in 1989 and also produced five of their nine studio albums. Despite never receiving much mainstream recognition, Ween developed a large, devoted [[cult following]] and garnered critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ingram|first1=Laynce|title=Band Ween and its cult-like following to The Lyric Theatre provide an insider's look at who a musician's true fans are|url=http://archive.thedmonline.com/article/band-ween-and-its-cult-following-lyric-theatre-provide-insider%E2%80%99s-look-who-musician%E2%80%99s-true-fa|website=The DM Online|access-date=January 1, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102081735/http://archive.thedmonline.com/article/band-ween-and-its-cult-following-lyric-theatre-provide-insider%E2%80%99s-look-who-musician%E2%80%99s-true-fa|archive-date=January 2, 2015}}</ref>

==History==
===Early years (1984–1989)===
[[File:Ween.jpg|thumb|right|Founding members Mickey Melchiondo ([[Dean Ween]]) and Aaron Freeman ([[Gene Ween]]), pictured in 1997]]
[[Gene Ween|Aaron Freeman]] and [[Dean Ween|Mickey Melchiondo]] met in a junior high school typing class in 1984.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ween FAQ|url=http://www.ween.net/ween-faq.html|website=Ween.net}}</ref> Freeman recalled, "We didn't like each other. He was a jock, and I was more of a trench-coat guy. But we sat next to each other in typing class and both realized we were into music."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shteamer|first1=Hank|title=Laughs Last|url=http://www.timeout.com/newyork/music/laughs-last|access-date=January 1, 2015|publisher=Time Out New York|date=November 29, 2007}}</ref> The name Ween was a word made up by the duo, a combination of the words [[wuss]] and [[penis]].<ref name="Ween Documentary">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6L2YKqtyDA#t=304s |title=Ween Documentary |via=[[YouTube]] |access-date=October 19, 2016}}</ref> Their earliest home recordings were drug fueled and free-spirited; Melchiondo would later say about this era, "the music was designed to be obnoxious".<ref name="Ween Documentary"/>

From 1984 until 1994, Ween's live lineup consisted of Freeman on lead vocals and occasional rhythm guitar, Melchiondo on lead guitar and backing vocals, and a [[Digital Audio Tape]] (DAT) machine providing the pre-recorded backing tracks. They self-released six cassettes in the late eighties: ''Mrs. Slack'' (1985), ''[[The Crucial Squeegie Lip]]'' (1986), ''[[Axis: Bold as Boognish]]'' (1987), ''[[Erica Peterson's Flaming Crib Death]]'' (1987), ''[[The Live Brain Wedgie/WAD]]'' (1988), and ''[[Prime 5]]'' (1989). In 1987, Freeman also released his own tape, ''[[Synthetic Socks]]'', which featured Melchiondo on a few tracks. Ween's public debut was at the New Hope-Solebury High School talent show in 1986, where they performed a cover of [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s "[[Purple Haze]]" with Chris Williams (a.k.a. Mean Ween) on bass and Karl Weimer on drums. Although this era was mostly just Freeman, Melchiondo and the DAT machine, they did play a few shows in the '80s as "The Ween" backed by the [[Rollins Band]] rhythm section, [[Andrew Weiss (guitarist)|Andrew Weiss]] and [[Sim Cain]].<ref name="archive.org">{{cite web|title=Ween Live at VPRO Radio Show on 1990-04-18|url=https://archive.org/details/ween1990-04-18|website=Archive.org|date=April 18, 1990|access-date=January 8, 2015}}</ref>

By 1988, Ween had become regulars at John and Peter's in New Hope and [[City Gardens]] in [[Trenton, New Jersey]]. At City Gardens, they opened for acts such as [[They Might Be Giants]], [[GWAR]], [[Butthole Surfers]], and [[Henry Rollins]]. Following a February 1990 City Gardens performance where Ween's reception was lukewarm, Rollins got on stage and warned the crowd to "start liking them now", for one day, "you will get down on your filthy knees and crawl to the altar that is Ween".<ref>{{cite web|title=Ween - Trenton City Gardens - 2/2/90 - Fights with crowd - Henry Rollins rant - Full Set|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7uNs1JeNRc|via=YouTube|publisher=TubbsTheCat|access-date=January 5, 2015}}</ref>

===Lo-fi period (1990–1993)===
Dave Ayers, working in [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] for [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]]-based record label [[Twin/Tone Records|Twin/Tone]], went to see a live performance by alt-rock band [[Skunk (band)|Skunk]] in the late '80s in [[Maplewood, New Jersey]] in anticipation of signing them to a record deal. Ween, friends of Skunk, were the opening act that night. Ayers signed Ween to Twin/Tone that night, and would soon become the band's manager. Skunk would break up in 1991 and their drummer, [[Claude Coleman, Jr.]], would play a few shows with Ween in 1992 before joining the band full-time in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Coleman Jr.|first1=Claude|title=Claude Coleman Jr. Reddit AMA|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gz17c/hi_i_am_claude_coleman_jr_the_drummer_for_ween/|website=Reddit|access-date=January 2, 2015}}</ref>

[[File:Ween (1993).jpg|left|thumb|Ween in 1993]]

Ween's debut album for Twin/Tone, ''[[GodWeenSatan: The Oneness]]'', was released on November 16, 1990. It consisted of 26 tracks that were written during their first six years, and can be thought of as a "best of" this era. Some of the songs, such as "You Fucked Up" and "Bumblebee", had already appeared on various Ween cassettes from the late '80s. "You Fucked Up", "Fat Lenny", "Nan", and the heavily [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]-inspired "L.M.L.Y.P." would become staples of the band's live show for years to come. Ween played their first overseas shows in support of the album, with a series of dates in the Netherlands in December/January 1990–91.<ref>{{cite web|title=Brownbase: Ween setlists|url=http://brownbase.org/show_filter.php?all=1|website=Brownbase|access-date=January 1, 2015}}</ref>

The band released their second full-length album, ''[[The Pod]]'', in 1991 on the [[Shimmy-Disc]] label. It was recorded on a four-track cassette recorder from January to October 1990. The album borrows its title from the [[Solebury Township, Pennsylvania]] apartment in which it was recorded. The duo's use of [[drum machine]]s, pitch-shifted guitars/vocals and drug-laced humor became a trademark part of their sound. The cover of ''The Pod'' was a parody of the cover of the 1975 [[Leonard Cohen]] album, ''[[The Best of Leonard Cohen]]'', but with the head of Chris "Mean Ween" Williams (who played bass on the ''Pod'' track "Alone") in place of Cohen's. Although the liner notes claim the album was recorded under the influence of [[scotchgard]], Freeman would later say that this was tongue-in-cheek.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ween Interview|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/ween-13827|website=AV Club|access-date=December 29, 2014}}</ref> Following the release of ''The Pod'', Ween embarked on their first extensive U.S. tour, as well as a week-long U.K. tour that included a recording with [[John Peel]] in the [[BBC]] studio. The February 1992 U.K. tour would be Ween's first performances with Claude Coleman Jr., and also featured Shimmy-Disc founder [[Kramer (musician)|Kramer]] on bass.

Ween signed with [[Elektra Records]] and released their major label debut ''[[Pure Guava]]'' on November 10, 1992. Pure Guava featured their highest charting single, "[[Push th' Little Daisies]]" which gained them media and [[MTV]] attention, as the video was a highlighted target on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]''. The song was also a hit in Australia, reaching #18 on the singles chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Ween&titel=Push+Th%27+Little+Daisies&cat=s|title=Ween - Push th' Little Dasies (Song)|website=Australian-Charts.com|access-date=December 29, 2014}}</ref> The track "Flies on My Dick" featured lead vocals by [[Guy Heller]], singer of Melchiondo's other band, [[Moistboyz]]. Heller would occasionally perform the song live with Ween.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ween - Tour Guava - Flies on My Dick|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvdiYe1IiJE|via=YouTube|publisher=BoognishBrown27|access-date=January 2, 2015}}</ref> Ween toured the U.S. in support of the album, and the show of December 9 in Chapel Hill, NC would later be released as the CD/DVD package ''[[At the Cat's Cradle, 1992]]'' in 2008. Also in support of ''Pure Guava'', Ween performed at ''[[MTV]]'s Spring Break'' in Daytona Beach, FL as well as on ''The [[Jane Pratt]] Show''.

===Signing with Elektra Records (1994–1996)===

Following the release of ''Pure Guava'', Ween began to expand their live and studio lineup, providing both a crisper production sound in the studio and an easier live setup. Claude Coleman Jr. officially joined the band as drummer in March 1994, while Ween's long-time producer [[Andrew Weiss (guitarist)|Andrew Weiss]] picked up the bass duties. The Weiss-produced ''[[Chocolate and Cheese]]'' was released in 1994, featuring tracks influenced by '70s pop/rock and soul, such as "[[Freedom of '76]]" and "Voodoo Lady", the latter of which appeared on the ''[[Road Trip (film)|Road Trip]]'' and ''[[Dude, Where's My Car?]]'' soundtracks. The "Freedom of '76" music video was directed by [[Spike Jonze]]; the band also shot a  video for "I Can't Put My Finger On It" that was filmed at a Middle Eastern restaurant and featured actual employees of the restaurant. Both videos would be shown on season 5 of ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' in 1995. Ween performed "I Can't Put My Finger On It" on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' in January 1995. The ''Chocolate and Cheese'' track "Roses Are Free" began being covered by [[Phish]] regularly in concert in 1997. Freeman would later comment: "I like [[Trey Anastasio]] as a person, but as far as the music goes, all that jam band shit makes me want to puke".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Keller|first1=Jason|title=Q&A: Gene Ween of Ween|url=https://nowtoronto.com/music/q-and-a-gene-ween-of-ween/|website=Now Toronto|date=August 12, 2009|access-date=January 1, 2015}}</ref>  In 2011, ''Chocolate and Cheese'' would have a book written about it by Hank Shteamer, as a part of the [[33⅓]] book series about music albums. Of recording the album, Dean Ween said, "I saw someone wrote a book about Chocolate and Cheese, and my son put it in the bathroom. I was reading through it. What people were saying about me and Aaron [Freeman, aka Gene Ween] was that there was all this thought that went into this shit. It's total bullshit. We wrote a lot of material—it was good, we knew it was good—we picked our favorite songs and we put them out on the record. That was it. [Laughter.] And that's been true of every record I've made, from the first Ween record to the second Dean Ween record."<ref>Greenhaus, Mike https://relix.com/articles/detail/the_core_dean_ween_on_solo_work_album_construction_phish_and_more/ Relix</ref>

One month prior to the release of ''Chocolate and Cheese'', Ween appeared in the [[Saturday Night Live]] film ''[[It's Pat]]'', starring [[Julia Sweeney]]. The band (which in the film consisted of Freeman, Melchiondo, Weiss, and Weiss' brother John Weiss as the drummer) was featured in a supporting role and performed the ''Pod'' track "Pork Roll, Egg & Cheese" and the ''Pure Guava'' track "Don't Get 2 Close (2 My Fantasy)". The film was both a critical and box office failure, and was subsequently pulled from theaters one week after its opening weekend.<ref>{{cite web|title=It's Pat (1994) Trivia|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110169/trivia?ref_=tt_ql_2|publisher=IMDb|access-date=February 12, 2015}}</ref>

Also in 1994, Freeman, Melchiondo and Coleman collaborated with Japanese [[noise rock]] band [[Boredoms]] on a project released two years later as ''[[Z-Rock Hawaii]]''. Melchiondo became a big fan of Boredoms upon seeing them live in [[Philadelphia]] in 1993, calling them "the heaviest band [he] had ever seen since the [[Butthole Surfers]]".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Melchiondo |first1=Mickey |title=Boredoms/Z-Rock Hawaii |url=http://www.askdeaner.com/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120195659/http://askdeaner.com/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 20, 2013 |website=Ask Deaner |access-date=January 1, 2015 }}</ref> Boredoms frontman [[Yamantaka Eye]] had previously released an album that heavily sampled Ween's ''Pod'' album. These recording sessions took place in a [[Pennington, New Jersey]] studio during the recording of ''Chocolate and Cheese''.

Ween turned to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] [[studio musician]]s and producer [[Ben Vaughn]] for the November 1995 recording of ''[[12 Golden Country Greats]]'' (1996) which contained only ten tracks. There are two theories regarding the title of the album.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} The first claim is that it refers to the dozen veteran musicians, known as The Shit Creek Boys, who played on the album. The second claim refers to the fact that the band did indeed record twelve songs during the demo sessions for the album. When it came time to record the actual album, the band chose not to use the songs "I Got No Darkside" and "So Long, Jerry" but kept the album title. "So Long, Jerry", a tribute to the then recently deceased [[Jerry Garcia]], was featured as a B-Side on the "Piss Up a Rope" single. Sticking to Nashville tradition, Freeman and Melchiondo provided only vocals, allowing The Shit Creek Boys to play all the instruments. [[Elvis Presley]]'s former backing vocal quartet [[The Jordanaires]] appeared on the tracks "I'm Holding You" and "Powder Blue".<ref>{{cite web|title=Ween Interview - Austin, Texas|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-XBwKMHgyU|via=YouTube|publisher=OneFiveDoor|access-date=January 2, 2015}}</ref>

After a brief return to the original lineup of Freeman, Melchiondo and the DAT machine for a series of dates opening for the [[Foo Fighters]], Ween toured with the Shit Creek Boys in October 1996. This lineup performed not only ''12 Golden Country Greats'' material, but also played Ween songs from previous eras with added country instrumentation, including the ''Pure Guava'' tracks "Pumpin' 4 the Man" and "Push th' Little Daisies" and the ''Chocolate and Cheese'' tracks "What Deaner Was Talkin' About" and "Buenas Tardes Amigo". Parts of the show of October 23 at [[Toronto]]'s [[Phoenix Concert Theatre]] would later be released as the album, ''[[Live in Toronto Canada]]'' (2001).

===Commercial breakthrough (1997–2001)===

The nautically themed album ''[[The Mollusk]]'' followed in 1997. The album was another eclectic set showing Ween's penchant for satire, deconstruction, and [[pastiche]], including 1960s Brit-pop, [[Sea shanty|sea shanties]], [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[show tunes]], and especially [[progressive rock]]. Months prior to its release, Freeman would describe the album as "our dark, acid rock record".<ref>{{cite web|title=WEEN Public Access TV 5-27-97 Buckingham Green, She Wanted to Leave *LIVE*+ Interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoAJFohUSt0|via=YouTube|publisher=gummybearcavity|access-date=January 1, 2015}}</ref> In 2007, Melchiondo himself named ''The Mollusk'' his favorite among Ween's oeuvre.<ref>{{cite web|last=Usinger |first=Mike |url=https://www.straight.com/article-117368/dean-ween-picks-his-favourite-ween-disc-gives-the-back-story-on-la-cucaracha |title=Dean Ween picks his favourite Ween disc, gives the back story on La Cucaracha |publisher=Straight.com |date=November 8, 2007 |access-date=September 14, 2011}}</ref> ''The Mollusk'' was the album to finally feature studio recordings of "Buckingham Green" and "The Blarney Stone", both of which had been performed regularly in concert for years. Although they did not play on the album, bassist [[Dave Dreiwitz]] and keyboardist [[Glenn McClelland]] joined the band in April 1997; their debut was a performance of the ''Mollusk'' track "The Golden Eel" on an episode of the [[Comedy Central]] show ''[[Viva Variety]]''. The lineup of Freeman-Melchiondo-McClelland-Dreiwitz-Coleman would remain the same until Ween's hiatus in 2012.

Following the release of ''The Mollusk'', Ween contributed two songs to two different [[Trey Parker]]/[[Matt Stone]] projects. The song "Love" appeared in the film ''[[Orgazmo]]'' in September 1997. The song "The Rainbow", as well as Freeman and Melchiondo themselves, appeared in a season 2 episode of ''[[South Park (season 2)|South Park]]'', titled "[[Chef Aid]]" in October 1998. It was later released on the compilation ''[[Chef Aid: The South Park Album]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kaufman |first=Gil |date=May 30, 2018 |title=How Music Supervisors for 'Armageddon,' 'Can't Hardly Wait' & More Kept Soundtracks Weird & Wonderful in 1998 |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/movies/8457073/1998-movie-soundtracks-bulworth-armageddon-interviews |work=Billboard |location=New York |access-date=December 10, 2018 }} </ref> Parker & Stone later directed the music video for the ''White Pepper'' track "[[Even If You Don't]]". The band's desire to pursue alternate forms of media led to the [[MP3]]-only release ''[[Craters of the Sac]]'' (1999), presented by Melchiondo for online download and free trade. [[Elektra Records]] released a live compilation titled ''[[Paintin' the Town Brown: Ween Live 1990-1998]]'' in 1999.

Ween's sixth studio album, ''[[White Pepper]]'', was the band's final studio release for Elektra and was released May 2, 2000. The [[pop music|pop]]-themed, [[Lennon-McCartney]]–inspired album produced two singles: "[[Even If You Don't]]", which was made into a music video directed by [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], and "Stay Forever".  Shortly after the release of ''White Pepper'', Ween started the Internet radio station WeenRadio, which was awarded third best Internet music site by ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.<ref name="rollingstone1">David Kushner, [https://web.archive.org/web/20071014121741/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/ween/articles/story/5919334/the_top_ten_best_digital_music_entities_of_2000 The Top Ten Best Digital Music Entities of 2000], ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', December 28, 2000.

In November 2000, Ween contributed the song "Loop de Loop" for the ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' episode "Your Shoe's Untied".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5jQ5AQAAIAAJ&q=loop+de+loop+ween+spongebob |title=The Billboard Albums: Includes Every Album That Made the Billboard 200 Chart - Google Books |isbn=9780898201666 |access-date=May 14, 2014|last1=Whitburn |first1=Joel |year=2006 }}</ref>  SpongeBob creator [[Stephen Hillenburg]] had contacted Ween and told them that ''[[The Mollusk]]'' was one of the show's biggest inspirations.

Ween formed their own label in 2001, Chocodog Records, which oversaw the release of several self-produced live sets. ''Paintin' the Town Brown'', which was compiled and mastered by the band, was meant to be the first Chocodog release.  According to Melchiondo, once the album was completed, Elektra realized the sales potential of the CD and denied Ween the right to release it through Chocodog. Later, Ween released the first official Chocodog album, ''[[Live In Toronto Canada|Live in Toronto]]''. The limited-pressing CD, available exclusively through the band website, became an instant collector's item. Subsequent Chocodog releases were produced in higher volumes to meet demand. To celebrate the re-release of the band's debut album ''GodWeenSatan: The Oneness'', Ween returned to the original lineup of Freeman, Melchiondo, and the DAT to perform the album in its entirety on September 15, 2001, at John and Peter's in New Hope. Taping was not permitted at this show; in 2015 Melchiondo described it as "the ultimate unreleased bootleg" but claimed it would someday be released.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Melchiondo|first1=Mickey|title=The Dean Ween Group|url=https://www.facebook.com/deanweengroup?ref=br_tf|website=Facebook.com|access-date=February 4, 2015}}{{Primary source inline|date=April 2019}}</ref>

===Return to independent labels, live albums (2002–2007)===

[[File:Ween in Edmonton Alberta.jpg|alt=|thumb|Ween performing in [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]] in 2007]]
On August 7, 2002, Claude Coleman Jr. was seriously injured in a car accident on [[Route 78]] near [[Newark, New Jersey]], suffering a broken back and pelvis. Ween quickly organized a couple of benefit shows at [[New York City]]'s [[Bowery Ballroom]] in October to help cover his medical bills.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Caffrey|first1=Scott|title=Ween Drummer Injured in Auto Accident|url=http://www.jambase.com/Articles/2832/WEEN-DRUMMER-INJURED-IN-AUTO-ACCIDENT|website=JamBase|access-date=January 1, 2015}}</ref> Ween recruited [[The Vandals|Vandals]] drummer [[Josh Freese]] to perform at these gigs as well as on the band's next album, ''[[Quebec (album)|Quebec]]''. Coleman would make his comeback in December, backing up Freeman at an acoustic show in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]]. Also in December, Ween would release the three-disc ''[[Live at Stubb's (Ween album)|Live at Stubb's]]'', which contained parts of two performances in [[Austin, Texas]] from July 2000 during the ''White Pepper'' tour.

Ween signed to [[Sanctuary Records]] and released ''Quebec'', their first studio release in three years, on August 5, 2003. ''Quebec'' was noticeably darker in tone than much of Ween's work; according to Freeman, many of the songs were written as he was going through a divorce: "I wrote most of these songs right before the end [of the relationship]. A lot of these songs are about that. Even if it's not direct, you can feel the beginning of the end of the breakup in these songs."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gonzales|first1=Matt|title=Taste the Waste: A Conversation With Gene Ween|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/ween-030819/|website=PopMatters|access-date=January 1, 2015}}</ref> Melchiondo would add, "I like it as a record, but it's very negative.

Later that year, the band held a poll on their official message boards to select songs for the band to play on their forthcoming live-in-studio album ''[[All Request Live]]''. Released on November 22, the album would feature a performance of all five parts of "The Stallion" (Parts 1 & 2 from ''[[The Pod]]'', Part 3 from "''[[Pure Guava]]''", the unreleased Part 4 from the demos for "''[[Chocolate and Cheese]]''", and Part 5 from [[Craters of the Sac]]). On November 3, 2017, they would perform "The Stallion Suite" live at Stubb's BBQ in Austin, TX. All Request Live also included rarely played early Ween tracks such as "Pollo Asado", "Mononucleosis", and "Cover it with Gas and Set it on Fire", and Ween's rejected [[Pizza Hut]] jingle, "Where'd the Cheese Go?".

In 2004, Ween released ''[[Live in Chicago (Ween album)|Live in Chicago]]'', a DVD and CD set that compiled tracks from two live performances from the ''Quebec'' tour at [[Chicago]]'s [[The Vic Theatre|Vic Theatre]] in November 2003. After playing the festival circuit in the summer, Ween hit the road for a West Coast tour in October. Following the show of October 17 in [[San Diego]], Ween's manager Greg Frey announced that the upcoming Midwest tour would be canceled so Freeman could enter alcohol rehab. In the statement, Frey wrote: "There is a problem within the band, that requires immediate intervention, for the health, welfare, and safety of one of its members. For this member, years of touring have taken their toll."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Flakey|title=Ween tour canceled|url=http://weenery.tribe.net/thread/f695772d-f350-49aa-8085-f3039b9b5c36|website=Tribe.net|access-date=January 12, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009034603/http://weenery.tribe.net/thread/f695772d-f350-49aa-8085-f3039b9b5c36|archive-date=October 9, 2015}}</ref> Ween would take a year-long hiatus from touring before hitting the road again in October 2005.

In 2005, Ween hit the studio to record better quality versions of previously unreleased songs for the compilation ''[[Shinola, Vol. 1]]''. The twelve tracks were all, according to Melchiondo, "songs we regretted not putting on other records". The tracks spanned the band's career, from "Tastes Good on th' Bun", a ''Pod'' outtake, to "Someday", a ''Quebec'' outtake. Different versions of three of the songs, "Big Fat Fuck", "How High Can You Fly?" and "Monique the Freak" had previously appeared on ''Craters of the Sac''. Melchiondo would later comment, "We called it Volume 1, but I don't know if I want to go through that again anytime soon".<ref name="Dean Ween of Ween"/>

In February 2006, Ween rented an old farmhouse and converted it into a working studio. After writing over 50 songs and recording rough versions through 2006, they picked through them and, with Andrew Weiss as a producer, re-recorded album versions for what would become ''[[The Friends EP]]'' and the full-length ''[[La Cucaracha (album)|La Cucaracha]]'' which was released October 23, 2007, on [[Rounder Records]]. ''La Cucaracha'', which would prove to be Ween's final album, would later be called a "big piece of shit" by Freeman, adding, "I think the songs on it were good, or a bunch of songs, but overall that was a big clue Mickey and I were finito".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rutledge|first1=Chris|title=Q&A: Shooting The Breeze With Aaron Freeman|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2014/07/qa-shooting-the-breeze-with-aaron-freeman-aaron-freeman/|website=American Songwriter|date=July 25, 2014|access-date=January 4, 2015}}</ref>

===Focus on non-Ween projects, Vancouver Incident (2008–2011)===

[[File:Flickr - moses namkung - Ween 1.jpg|alt=|thumb|left|Ween performing at the [[Outside Lands Music Festival]] in 2009]]
On September 21, 2008, Melchiondo announced on the official Ween website that they planned to release a CD-DVD combo before Christmas of that year. He stated, "This time we're going to be going all the way back to the days when we were still a duo with a cassette deck in the early 90s. It's probably the brownest CD on the Chocodog label yet." That CD was titled ''At the Cat's Cradle'' and was recorded live at the Cat's Cradle in Carrboro, North Carolina on December 9, 1992. The package also included a DVD featuring some video of performances from the same era.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chocodog.com/chocodog/ween/ween_new/news_fr.html |title=Ween |publisher=Chocodog.com |access-date=July 7, 2011}}</ref>

Although Freeman had occasionally played solo acoustic shows before 2008, he turned his focus towards these shows—billed as "Gene Ween"—following the ''La Cucaracha'' tour. In December 2008, he began performing with "The Gene Ween Band", which featured Dreiwitz on bass along with [[Joe Russo (musician)|Joe Russo]] on drums and Scott Metzger on guitar. The set-lists of these shows featured more obscure Ween songs rarely played at Ween shows, a few covers, as well as numerous Freeman-penned songs being performed for the first time. Freeman would perform dozens of shows both solo and with the Gene Ween Band from 2008 to 2011. His first solo record, ''Marvelous Clouds'', an album of [[Rod McKuen]] covers, would be released three weeks before Ween's breakup.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Jarnow|first1=Jesse|title=Aaron Freeman, a.k.a.

While Freeman was working on non-Ween musical projects, Melchiondo turned his focus to [[fishing]]. Melchiondo, who spent a lot of time in his youth at his parents' beach house in [[Beach Haven, New Jersey]], became a licensed fishing boat captain and hosted a web series, "Brownie Troop Fishing Show", from 2008 to 2011. As of 2015, he still offers trips on his website, "Mickey's Guide Service", running them out of New Hope as well as [[Belmar, NJ]]. In 2013, it was announced that Trey Parker and Matt Stone would be producing a pilot for a reality television show about fishing, starring Melchiondo and [[Les Claypool]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rayner|first1=Caroline|title=Dean Ween and Les Claypool will soon have their own fishing show, because what the hell else are they going to do?|url=http://www.tinymixtapes.com/news/dean-ween-and-les-claypool-will-soon-have-their-own-fishing-show-because-what-the-hell-else-are|website=Tiny Mix Tapes|access-date=January 11, 2015}}</ref>

On February 3, 2010, Ween released a new song, "DC Won't Do You No Good", that became available through a Target Cancer website. On July 28, 2010, the ''[[National Post]]'' featured an article,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/Ween+band+that+doesn+suck/3333531/story.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20100731175855/http://www.nationalpost.com/Ween+band+that+doesn+suck/3333531/story.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 31, 2010 |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 27, 2010 }}</ref> with an interview with Melchiondo, in which it was stated that the band is due in the studio this winter to start work on their tenth album.

Ween embarked on a brief West Coast tour at the beginning of 2011. The first show of the tour, January 24 at the [[Queen Elizabeth Theatre]] in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], was a turning point in Ween's history. It was noticeable from the start that something was off with Freeman, who played the tambourine off-beat on the first song, "Fiesta". His vocals were off-key throughout the night, and he appeared to be heavily intoxicated. Eventually, Freeman lay down on stage while the rest of the band played an instrumental, jam version of the [[The Carpenters|Carpenters]] song "[[Superstar (Delaney and Bonnie song)|Superstar]]". As Freeman began tuning his guitar in preparation for "Birthday Boy", Melchiondo and Dreiwitz walked off the stage, while Coleman and McClelland switched instruments. After "Birthday Boy" was finished, Coleman and McClelland left Freeman to play the final four songs by himself and horribly off-key.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Usinger|first1=Mike|title=Ween completely blows it with a bizarre Vancouver show|url=https://www.straight.com/music/ween-completely-blows-it-bizarre-vancouver-show|access-date=December 31, 2014|publisher=Straight.com|date=January 25, 2011}}</ref> Despite this disaster, the band performed in [[Seattle, Washington]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bandsintown.com/Ween/past_events |title=Ween Tour History from 2007 - 2016 - Ween Past Tour Dates |website=Bandsintown.com |access-date=October 19, 2016}}</ref> the following night with no issues. Freeman later wrote a song about the Vancouver incident, "Covert Discretion", which appeared as the opening track to [[Freeman (Freeman album)|self-titled debut album]], by his new band, called Freeman, in 2014. That same year, he commented, "You don't blow it on stage, lying on your back, screaming nonsense in front of 5,000 people and not try to change something. Chances are when you're doing something like that, you've got to do something differently."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Moffitt|first1=Casey|title=INTERVIEW: Aaron Freeman Moves On From Gene Ween|url=http://chicagoist.com/2014/09/23/there_was_a_time_when.php|website=Chicagoist|access-date=February 6, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215151108/http://chicagoist.com/2014/09/23/there_was_a_time_when.php|archive-date=February 15, 2015}}</ref>

===Breakup (2011–2015)===
On August 11, 2011, Melchiondo quietly released an MP3-only collection of songs called ''The Caesar Demos'', named after the band's original working title for ''Quebec'', to friends on his [[Facebook]] page. In his comment, he stated the songs were all recorded between 2001 and 2003 while Claude Coleman was recovering from injuries sustained in a car accident, and that many of the tracks featured only himself and Freeman. In addition to a handful of tracks that eventually made ''Quebec'', ''Caesar Demos'' would also feature several previously unreleased tracks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ween.net/ |title=Ween .

Posting on the band's official message boards under the handle "Taer", Freeman commented: "The Caesar demo release was the straw that broke the camels (sic) back. Nobody asked Gener before releasing...Deaner broke the golden rule. the Boognish wept that day."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Freeman|first1=Aaron|title=Caesar Demos: Mickey Just released them on Facebook.|url=http://weendotnetforum16662.yuku.com/topic/30374/Caesar-Demos-Mickey-Just-released-them-on-Facebook?page=24|website=Ween.net Forum|access-date=January 2, 2015}}</ref>

Freeman announced to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' on May 29, 2012, that he was "retiring Gene Ween",<ref name="RollingStoneCloses">{{cite web |title=Aaron Freeman Closes the Book on Ween |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/aaron-freeman-closes-the-book-on-ween-20120529|work=Rolling Stone |access-date=May 29, 2012 |author = Darrin Levin|date=May 29, 2012}}</ref> and a few days later, Ween's manager, Greg Frey, told fans on Facebook that Freeman had decided to "end his musical relationship with Ween", in order to "more fully explore and pursue his solo career".<ref name="AaronFreemanFacebook">{{cite web|last=Frey|first=Greg|title=Aaron Freeman Ends Musical Relationship With Ween|url=https://www.facebook.com/theaaronfreeman|publisher=Official Aaron Freeman Facebook Page|access-date=May 31, 2012}}</ref> Melchiondo appeared to be unaware of this, stating, "This is news to me, all I can say for now I guess".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/ween/posts/10150851696028564 |title=This is news to me, all I can say for... - Mickey Melchiondo |publisher=[[Facebook]] |date=May 29, 2012 |access-date=October 19, 2016}}</ref> On July 20, Melchiondo addressed the supposed "breakup" and stated "I can only speak for myself, but as far as I'm concerned, as long as Aaron and I are both alive on this planet, Ween is still together. We've never broken up. The idea of quitting is just laughable. This isn't something you can quit.

Later, Freeman confirmed his departure from Ween was triggered by his desire to remain sober, saying "All that matters to me is that I'm getting sober. Becoming an out of control drug addict and alcoholic is my own fault and I take responsibility for it. I HAD to leave the Ween organization to stay sober."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glidemagazine.com/hiddentrack/ween-drama-aaron-and-mickey-post-on-ween-forum/ |title=Ween Drama: Aaron and Mickey Post on Ween Forum |work=Glide Magazine |access-date=October 19, 2016}}</ref>

Although no one knew it at the time, Ween's final performances for more than four years were a three-night run at [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]]'s Fillmore Auditorium December 29–31, 2011, with "The Blarney Stone" being the final song performed by the band until their 2016 reunion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brownbase.org/setlist.php?show_id=12 |title=Ween Setlists and Statistics &#124; 12/31/2011 Denver |website=Brownbase.org|date=December 31, 2011 |access-date=October 19, 2016}}</ref> Melchiondo quickly re-formed Moistboyz, which had been on a six-year hiatus, and also started a new band, The Dean Ween Group. Freeman played solo shows until 2014, when he began touring and recording with his new band, "[[Freeman (band)|Freeman]]". In 2015, Freeman began using the Gene Ween moniker again for live performances.

===Reunion (2015–present)===
On November 16, 2015, Ween announced that they would reunite for two concerts at the [[1stBank Center]] in Broomfield, Colorado on February 12 and 13, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=WEEN|url=http://ween.com/index.php|website=Ween.com|access-date=November 17, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117123340/http://ween.com/index.php|archive-date=November 17, 2015}}</ref> During ticket presale, a third show was added on February 14, 2016 due to demand. Throughout 2016, Ween played sporadic reunion shows in Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Boston, New York, and San Francisco. The band also made festival appearances in Toronto, Chicago, Portland, [[Arrington, Virginia]], [[Okeechobee, Florida]], and [[Manchester, Tennessee]], for Bonnaroo, which was streamed online via [[Red Bull GmbH|Red Bull]] TV. The band was also due to appear in April at Levitation Festival in Austin, which was canceled the day before the weekend began.

A sequel to the first outtakes collection, ''Shinola vol. 1'', was confirmed to be in the works by Dean Ween on Facebook in January 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://i.imgur.com/nRhcEkJ.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 22, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629130435/http://i.imgur.com/nRhcEkJ.jpg |archive-date=June 29, 2016 }}</ref> On October 19, 2016 the band announced the release of the live album ''[[GodWeenSatan Live]]'', which was recorded on September 14, 2001, and features the band performing its debut album in its entirety.

Like most concert tours by music artists in 2020, Ween's touring was [[Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the music industry|disrupted by COVID-19]]; dates for June and July were postponed into 2021, and as of recent weeks, have continued that pattern to maintain safety of themselves, and fans.<ref>{{cite web |title=WEEN - Due to the ongoing pandemic, we are disappointed... |url=https://ween.com/post/618110057379430400/due-to-the-ongoing-pandemic-we-are-disappointed |website=WEEN |language=en}}</ref> They have since rescheduled the tour to 2022.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ween.com/post/649275367747682304/whats-worse-than-rescheduling-tour-dates-once|title = WEEN - What's worse than rescheduling tour dates once?}}</ref>

==Style and influences==
Ween is known for its far-reaching musical approach which takes influence from many different genres of music. This style has been termed [[alternative rock]]<ref name=pa662>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DykffzkFALoC&pg=PA662 |title=Rock Obituaries - Knocking On Heaven's Door |author=Nick Talevski |page=662 |date= April 7, 2010|isbn=9780857121172 |access-date=October 19, 2016}}</ref><ref name=pa6>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywSpAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA6 |title=Moonshine: A Cultural History of America's Infamous Liquor |author=Jaime Joyce |page=6 |date= June 10, 2014|isbn=9780760345849 |access-date=October 19, 2016}}</ref><ref name=pa97>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xgsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA97 |title=Billboard |page=97 |date=August 19, 1995 |access-date=October 19, 2016}}</ref> and [[experimental rock]]<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bz5XSRV50fgC&pg=PA211 |title=Redefining Mainstream Popular Music |author=Sarah Baker |year=2013 |page=211 |isbn=9780415807807 |access-date=October 19, 2016}}</ref> by critics and journalists. Melchiondo once stated, "Each of us had different things in our record collections that the other one didn't have. Aaron's dad had a lot of psychedelic records, I was really into punk rock, and we would just turn each other on to music."<ref>{{cite web|title=Ween Interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1ChVoziIzk|via=YouTube|access-date=January 1, 2015}}</ref> Freeman remarked in 2011, "I think when Ween formed I was really into the synthesizer [[New wave music|New Wave]] thing of the mid-'80s and Mickey was more into the punk rock thing".<ref name="Lollapalooza 2011: Q&A with Ween">{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Brandon James|title=Lollapalooza 2011: Q&A with Ween|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2011-07-28-lollapalooza-2011-ween_n.htm|website=USA Today News|access-date=January 1, 2015}}</ref>

Because of Ween's wide variety of styles and humorous lyrics, they have often been compared to [[Frank Zappa]].

From Ween's earliest days, they claimed to be "sprouted from the demon-god Boognish". The image of the Boognish is the band's logo. Boognish is also featured in the lyrics of several Ween songs, including "Up on th' Hill", "Pass the Bong", and "The Stallion, pt. 4". The band coined their own term "brown", which is used to describe performances, songs, etc. that are "fucked up, in a good way".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Harvey|first1=Eric|title=FREEMAN: FREEMAN|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19506-freeman-freeman/|website=Pitchfork|access-date=February 1, 2015}}</ref> The word "brown" is also featured in the lyrics of the songs "Can't Put My Finger on It", "Mutilated Lips", "If You Could Save Yourself (You'd Save Us All)", and "Chocolate Town," as well as the title of the band's live album ''Paintin' the Town Brown''. Another commonly used word is "waste" ("Can U Taste the Waste?", "Tender Situation", "Chocolate Town", and "Back to Basom").

The band's lyrics also commonly contain references to the band's members, frequent collaborators, and friends, including Freeman ("I Saw Gener Cryin' In His Sleep", "Up on th' Hill", and "Puffy Cloud"), Melchiondo ("What Deaner Was Talkin' About", "Puffy Cloud", "The Stallion, pt. 2", and "Leave Deaner Alone"), Williams ("Booze Me Up and Get Me High" and "Sketches of Winkle"), Weiss ("Pass the Bong" and "Booze Me Up and Get Me High"), and Larry "Eddie Dingle" Curtin ("Nan", "Laura", "Pork Roll, Egg & Cheese", and "Molly"). Coleman states that the song "I Don't Wanna Leave You on the Farm" was written about him not wanting to leave his then-girlfriend to go on tour, but denied that "Waving My Dick In the Wind" was about him, calling the idea "complete nonsense."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/writing/claude_coleman_jr_of_ween/|title=Claude Coleman, Jr. of Ween|website=Songfacts.com|access-date=October 2, 2016}}</ref>

Ween has also been known for countless references to food, most notably the New Jersey regional favorite [[pork roll]], found in the lyrics to four ''[[The Pod|Pod]]'' tracks: "Pork Roll, Egg & Cheese", "Frank", "Awesome Sound", and "She Fucks Me". The ''Pod'' track "Pollo Asado" features Freeman giving a rendition of a conversation he had with a customer while he worked at New Hope's El Taco Loco. The liner notes of ''[[GodWeenSatan: The Oneness]]'' instructed Ween fans to bring food for the band to their concerts, with the request updated in the liner notes of ''Pure Guava'' to "bring us hot meals. No more junk food, thanks".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Snope |first=Matthew |date=January 29, 2015 |title=Ween Cuisine: Classic Food Moments in Ween Songs |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/01/ween-cuisine-classic-food-moments-in-ween-songs.html |magazine=Paste Magazine |location=Decatur, Georgia |publisher=Wolfgang's Vault |access-date=November 30, 2018 }}</ref>
