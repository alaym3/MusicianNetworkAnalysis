'''King 810''' (pronounced ''King eight one oh''; formerly known as, and often shortened to, simply '''King''') is an American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Flint, Michigan]], formed in 2007. The band currently consists of David Gunn and Eugene Gill, with touring musicians Johnpaul Vega and Hector Dominguez. The band's first release was their independent EP titled ''Midwest Monsters'' in 2012, which earned them a signing with [[Roadrunner Records]]; they released their second EP titled ''Proem'' in 2014, and their debut studio album ''[[Memoirs of a Murderer (album)|Memoirs of a Murderer]]'' that same year.

== History ==
=== Formation and ''Midwest Monsters'' (2007–2012) ===
The band officially formed in December 2007 in their hometown of [[Flint, Michigan]]; however, the four members of the group had been performing together before then and had already gained a following.<ref name="Formation - MLive interview">{{cite web|last1=Ketchum|first1=William|title=King 810's David Gunn talks life in Flint and unapologetically describing city woes|url=http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/flint/index.ssf/2014/09/king_810s_david_gunn_talks_lif.html|website=Mlive.com|date=September 9, 2014|publisher=MLive|access-date=February 5, 2015}}</ref> The lineup consisted of frontman and vocalist David Gunn, bassist Eugene Gill, drummer Andrew Workman and guitarist Andrew Beal.<ref name="Billboard Bio">{{cite web|last1=Monger|first1=James|title=King 810 – Biography|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/6230248/king-810/biography|website=Billboard.com|publisher=Billboard|access-date=February 5, 2015}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{cite web|url = http://hangout.altsounds.com/news/103895-equal-vision-records-signs-king-ft-jason.html|title = Equal Vision Records signs King ft Jason Hale of Chiodos|date = December 9, 2008|access-date = March 9, 2015|website = AltSounds.com|publisher = AltSounds|last = Maguire|first = Chris|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402124133/http://hangout.altsounds.com/news/103895-equal-vision-records-signs-king-ft-jason.html|archive-date = April 2, 2015}}</ref> David Gunn revealed in a ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' documentary that he started writing lyrics for the band when he was arrested and eventually applied those lyrics to the band, which had already developed a sound he recognized, so he adapted said lyrics to that style.<ref name="Carve My Name doc - Part 2">{{cite web|title=King 810 Carve My Name: Part 2|url=http://metalhammer.teamrock.com/videos/2014-09-01/king-810-carve-my-name-part-two|website=Metalhammer.com|publisher=Metalhammer|access-date=February 5, 2015}}</ref>

In 2008, it was reported that the band had signed with [[Equal Vision Records]], that [[Chiodos]] guitarist Jason Hale was a member of the band, making the band his side project, and that they intended to release a full-length studio album in 2009. They toured together across America in December 2008. The band released demos on their [[Myspace]], and it was reported that they had recorded an album with Mark Michalik at Detroit's 37 Studios.<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/archive_5313|title = Equal Vision signs King (Chiodos)|date = December 9, 2008|access-date = March 9, 2015|website = AltPress.com|publisher = AltPress}}</ref> However, in August 2009, the band abruptly left the label without a stated reason, and with no album released.

In June 2012, Gunn was assaulted when he refused to hand over a bag during a robbery. He was shot and stabbed, but survived the attack and went on to write for the band's debut and independent EP, ''Midwest Monsters'', which was heavily inspired by that particular event and previous experiences.<ref name="Kerrang!

In late July, the band released a music video for their single "I Ain't Goin Back Again", and revealed that their sophomore album will be titled ''La Petite Mort or a Conversation with God'' and will be released the same year, September 16. Other details regarding the album include its album artwork and its track list consisting of 13 songs.

Another track from the album, titled "Alpha & Omega", was released via the band's [[YouTube]] on August 24, 2016.

In 2017, Gunn had started a [[Mixed martial arts|light heavyweight MMA]] career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theprp.com/2017/01/18/news/king-810s-david-gunn-also-mma-fighter/|title=King 810's David Gunn Is Also An MMA Fighter|date=January 18, 2017|website=Theprp.com|access-date=February 13, 2017}}</ref> He has won two matches, and last fought in January 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=David Gunn|url=https://www.tapology.com/fightcenter/fighters/141784-david-gunn|website=Tapology.com|access-date=April 10, 2018}}</ref>

=== ''Suicide King'', Yavid, and Line-Up Change (2018–2019) ===
In the Spring of 2018 the band opened up for [[Emmure]] on their Natural Born Killers tour, [[Counterparts (band)|Counterparts]] and [[Varials]] joined up as support. King 810 was supposed to open up for [[Cane Hill]], but they dropped off the tour. The band would later announce that Andrew Beal and Andrew Workman had quit the band.

While Gunn and Gene wrote a third king album, Gunn launched a solo rap project under the name Yavid, releasing his debut album ''Black Teeth Devil, Vol. 1'' on July 13, 2018. Singles, such as "Bando Commando" and "Where Were You When We Would Ride", feature a huge change of style from previous King material with gangster rap and trap flows and beats. On September 7, 2018, he released the sequel ''Black Teeth Devil, Vol. 2''.

King made their return on January 25, 2019 with ''Suicide King''. It is the first record to be published and released independently after quietly and respectfully parting ways with Roadrunner Records in 2018. While opening the album with some of their heaviest tracks to date with singles "Heartbeats" and "Braveheart", the album is a drastic progression for the duo. The majority of tracks feature a similar rap/hip-hop style to Yavid with a wide variety of aggressive and melodic instrumentals. In addition, the cover art reflects the new colorful sound with the band's first ever non-black and white cover art. The album's lyrics, on the other hand, are bleak and nihilistic. In an interview, David says "around the time of the conception and making of ''Suicide King'', [he] had been diagnosed with an identity disorder (DID)" or Dissociative Identity Disorder.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/king-810-launch-video-for-savage-new-single-hellhounds |title=King 810 launch video for savage new single Hellhounds &#124; Louder |publisher=Loudersound.com |date=March 13, 2020 |access-date=April 7, 2020}}</ref> In King TV Episode 19, Gunn confirms that the album's subject matter is not only suicide but also money. The album completes a trilogy of albums all dealing with love. ''Memoirs'' deals with the love of violence, ''La Petite Mort'' with the love of sex, and ''Suicide King'' with the love of money.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqEdJpSQ1Eo] {{dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref>

Gunn continued his Black Teeth Devil series shortly after on April 12, 2019 with the EP ''Vol. 3.'' Gunn released another full Yavid album, entitled ''Paper Fortune Teller'' on October 30, 2019. The music video for the single "Hemingway" showcases footage of David running with the bulls in Spain. This is also the first Yavid album to include features from rappers Rio Da Young OG and Paperlovee (notwithstanding the single version of "God's Don't Bleed" with Game Spittaz, who was also on King 810's ''Midwest Monsters 2'' EP).

=== ''AK Concerto No. 47, 11th Movement in G Major'' (2020–present) ===

The band kicked off the 2020s hot with the singles, "Hellhounds," on March 13, "Dukes," on May 1, and "House of Dust" on June 12 with a new album on the way. But before the fourth King album, Yavid dropped another BTD rap album, ''Black Teeth Devil, Vol 4'', on April 16, featuring the single "The Noids." On July 31, 2020 New Album By Yavid 9 Muses.

On November 13, 2020 the band self released their 4th album, ''AK Concerto No. 47, 11th Movement in G Major''.

== Musical characteristics and lyrics ==
The band's lyrics are based on their lives growing up in the violent town of Flint. David Gunn himself was first arrested when he was nine years old, and states that in his area it was typical for kids at that age to commit crimes and use firearms.<ref name="Carve My Name doc - Part 1">{{cite web|title=King 810 Carve My Name: Part 1|url=http://metalhammer.teamrock.com/videos/2014-08-15/carve-my-name-part-one|website=Metalhammer.com|publisher=Metalhammer|access-date=February 5, 2015}}</ref> ''[[Kerrang!]]'' described Gunn's lyrical style as "heavy metal poetry" that, when performed live, has a theatrical vibe that would "leave venues full of grown men quivering in their boots." For this, they ranked the band number four of their 'Top 20 Hottest Bands in the World Right Now'.<ref name="Kerrang! 1540 4th Hottest Band">{{cite news|last1=Doyle|first1=Tom|title=20 Hottest Bands In The World Right Now|url=http://www.kerrang.com/24192/k1540-royal-blood-secrets-rock-phenomenon-revealed/|access-date=March 5, 2015|work=Kerrang!|agency=Kerrang!|issue=1540|publisher=Kerrang!|date=October 25, 2014}}</ref>

[[Robb Flynn]] of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]] says King 810 has always fascinated him as they have more of a punk-rock side – they were often banned from clubs due to the chaos and violence they caused.

After the release of their latest song "Revenge", Gunn released a statement suggesting that they will "...never make the same move twice and we're always creating."<ref name="Revenge stream"/>

=== Live performances ===
The band is known for its gritty stage presence and elaborate stage productions, with signature elements including Gunn performing covered in mud, hired men in masks wielding axes and baseball bats, and police security tape surrounding the stage to enhance the elements of crime and danger in their music.

=== Fan base ===
The band's fan base pre-dates its official formation and current name.<ref name="Formation - MLive interview"/> In their hometown of Flint, Michigan, their fans are known to be violent at their concerts, with one notable case occurring at a local music expo called 'Dirtfest' in 2009. Fans [[moshing|moshed]] violently, broke down fences, and fought back against police forces attempting to pacify them; some lit fireworks and aimed them into the crowd, and when the sound was ultimately cut off, fans continued singing their songs.<ref name="Noisey interview"/> Even before the band was signed, fans were observed with tattoos on their shins of the Flint area code (810) similar to those displayed by the band; some have gone as far as [[carving]] the band's logo into their skin.<ref name="Noisey interview"/>
