When asked to describe what kind of music the band plays, Strnad commented: 

{{quote |"I've always said that we're melodic death metal. We are mostly influenced by [[Swedish death metal|Swedish bands]] and Carcass. The heavy end of our sound is the American style creeping in, with some Floridian influences like [[Morbid Angel]], [[Malevolent Creation]] and that kind of stuff. We've been labeled more often because of our look than our sound, which is dumb, and speaks volumes about what kind of geniuses are out there!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pyromusic.net/index.php?p=interviews_interview&id=32 |title=Interview of: Trevor Strnad - The Black Dahlia Murder |website=PyroMusic.net |access-date=2011-10-21}}</ref> However, in an interview with ''Uranium Magazine'', Strnad also stated, "Some bands that get labeled as metalcore are actually good, like [[Between the Buried and Me]] or [[The Red Chord]]. Metal is what I grew up with, and then I learned about [[punk rock|punk]] and [[hardcore punk|hardcore]]. But a lot of our ethics, the way we carry ourselves, is more punk... I like that hardcore has a sense of community without the competition you see in metal."<ref>[http://www.uraniummusic.com/ilyapics/interviews/BDM.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928034835/http://www.uraniummusic.com/ilyapics/interviews/BDM.htm |date=September 28, 2011 }}</ref>}}
