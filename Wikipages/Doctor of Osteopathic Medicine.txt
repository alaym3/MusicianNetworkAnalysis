'''Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine''' ('''DO''' or '''D.O.''') is a [[medical degree]] offered by [[Medical school in the United States|medical schools]] in the [[United States]]. A DO graduate may become licensed as a [[physician]]. DOs have full [[Medicine|medical]] and [[Surgery|surgical]] practicing rights in [[Federation of State Medical Boards|all 50 US states]].

[[Osteopathy]], the older form of [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic medicine]], began in the United States in 1874.

The osteopathic medical profession has evolved into two branches: non-physician [[Manual therapy|manual medicine]] osteopaths, who were educated and trained outside the United States; and US-trained osteopathic physicians, who conduct a full scope of medical and surgical practice. The regulation of non-physician manual medicine osteopaths varies greatly between jurisdictions. In the United States, osteopathic physicians holding the DO degree have the same rights, privileges, and responsibilities as [[physicians]] with a [[Doctor of Medicine]] (MD) degree.<ref name=Medline /> Osteopathic physicians and non-physician osteopaths are so distinct that in practice they function as separate professions.

As originally conceived by Andrew Still, the letters "DO" stood for "Diplomate in Osteopathy" and the title conferred by the degree was "Doctor of Osteopathy".<ref name="Booth2006">{{cite book|author=Emmons Rutledge Booth|title=History of Osteopathy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jg6jQzKegQQC&pg=PA80|date=2006|isbn=978-3-936679-04-5|page=80}}</ref> Subsequently, the degree also came to be entitled "Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine".<ref name="DiGiovannaSchiowitz2005">{{cite book|author1=Eileen L.

==Demographics==
In 2018, there were 114,425 osteopathic [[physicians|medical doctors]] in the United States and 145,343 total DOs and osteopathic medical students. The proportion of females in the profession has steadily increased since the 1980s.<ref name=OMP_2012 />  In 1985, about 10 percent of DO physicians were female, compared with 41 percent in 2018.<ref name=OMP_2018>{{cite web|title=Osteopathic Medicine Profession Report 2015|url=https://osteopathic.org/wp-content/uploads/2018-OMP-Report.pdf|publisher=American Osteopathic Association|access-date=2016-01-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201133749/https://osteopathic.org/wp-content/uploads/2018-OMP-Report.pdf|archive-date=2016-02-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> Between 2008 and 2012, 49 percent of new DO graduates were females.<ref name=OMP_2012>{{cite web|title=Osteopathic Medical Profession Report 2012|url=http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/about/aoa-annual-statistics/Documents/2012-OMP-report.pdf|publisher=American Osteopathic Association|access-date=2012-12-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616054507/http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/about/aoa-annual-statistics/Documents/2012-OMP-report.pdf|archive-date=2013-06-16|url-status=dead}}</ref>

During the 2011â€“12 academic year, the osteopathic medical student body consisted of: 69 percent white/non-Hispanic, 19 percent Asian or Pacific Islander, 3.5 percent Hispanic, 3 percent African-American, and 0.5 percent Native American or Alaskan.<ref name=OMP_2012 /> The remainder were listed as "other or not entered".

== Education, training and distinctiveness ==
{{Further|Osteopathic medicine in the United States|Comparison of MD and DO in the United States}}
Osteopathic medical school curricula are virtually identical to those at schools granting the MD degree ([[Doctor of Medicine]]). Once admitted to an osteopathic medical school, students study for four years to graduate. The schooling is divided into the pre-clinical and clinical years. The pre-clinical years, the first and second years, focus on the biomedical and clinical sciences. The clinical years, the third and fourth years, consist of [[Clerkship (medicine)|core clinical training]] and [[sub-internship]]s in the clinical specialties.

Osteopathic medical school accreditation standards require training in [[internal medicine]], [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|obstetrics/gynecology]], [[pediatrics]], [[family medicine]], [[surgery]], [[psychiatry]], [[emergency medicine]], [[radiology]], [[preventive medicine]], and [[public health]].<ref name=curriculum>{{cite web|title=Overview of Osteopathic Medical Education/Accreditation/The Four-Year Curriculum (2012 Osteopathic Medical College Information Book) |url=http://www.aacom.org/resources/bookstore/cib/Documents/2012cib/2012cib-p8.pdf |publisher=American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine|date=2012}}</ref> According to [[Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine]], "the training, practice, credentialing, licensure, and reimbursement of osteopathic physicians is virtually indistinguishable from those of physicians with MD qualifications, with 4 years of osteopathic medical school followed by specialty and subspecialty training and [[board certification]]".<ref name=Harrisons />

DO schools provide an additional 300â€“500 hours in the study of hands-on manual medicine and the body's musculoskeletal system, which is referred to as [[osteopathic manipulative medicine]] (OMM).<ref name=Medline>{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002020.htm |title=Doctor of Osteopathic medicine (D.O.) |author=MedLine Plus |date=2007 |work=National Institutes of Health |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health |access-date=June 28, 2012}}</ref> Osteopathic physicians use OMM predominantly to treat musculoskeletal conditions.

Before entering osteopathic medical school, an applicant must complete a four-year undergraduate degree and take a national standardized exam called the [[Medical College Admissions Test]] (MCAT). Some combined undergraduate/medical programs exist. Some authors note the differences in the average MCAT scores and [[grade point average]] of students who [[Matriculation|matriculate]] at DO schools compared to those who matriculate at MD schools within the United States. In 2021, the average MCAT and GPA for students entering US-based MD programs were 511.5 and 3.73,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Medical School Average GPA & MCAT, Admissions Statistics and Acceptance Rates (2021)|url=https://mededits.com/medical-school-admissions/statistics/|access-date=2021-08-24|website=MedEdits|language=en-US}}</ref> respectively, and 504.0 and 3.55 for DO matriculants.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Average GPA and MCAT Score for Every Medical School (2021 Updates)|url=https://www.shemmassianconsulting.com/blog/average-gpa-and-mcat-score-for-every-medical-school|access-date=2021-08-24|website=Shemmassian Academic Consulting|language=en-US}}</ref> DO medical schools are more likely to accept non-traditional students,<ref>{{cite web|title=Osteopathic Medical College Information Book|url=http://www.aacom.org/resources/bookstore/cib/Documents/2012cib/2012cib-whole.pdf|publisher=American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine|date=2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Madison Park |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/06/13/mid.life.doctors/index.html?hpt=hp_t2/ |title=Never too late to be a doctor |publisher=CNN News |date=June 13, 2011 |access-date=December 17, 2011}}</ref> who are older and entering medicine as a second career, or coming from non-science majors.

DO medical students are required to take the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensure Examination ([[COMLEX-USA]]), which is sponsored by the [[National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners]] (NBOME). The COMLEX-USA is series of four osteopathic medical licensing examinations. The first three exams of the COMLEX-USA are taken during medical school and are prerequisites for residency programs. Level 2 consists of a multiple-choice portion and a patient evaluation exam (PE). COMLEX-Level 2 PE, is available in [[Chicago]], Illinois, and [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. It is graded as a Pass/Fail exam. Finally, COMLEX Level 3 is taken during the first year of residency.

In addition to the COMLEX-USA, DO medical students may choose to sit for the MD licensure examinations, which are called the [[United States Medical Licensing Examination]] (USMLE).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmle.org/bulletin/eligibility/ |title=United States Medical Licensing Examination {{pipe}} USMLE Bulletin {{pipe}} Eligibility |publisher=Usmle.org |access-date=2012-02-22}}</ref> This is typically done under specific circumstances, such as when the student desires to enter a residency that may have a historic preference for the USMLE, or if a higher USMLE score would help elevate the student's application to be more competitive. USMLE pass rates for DO and MD students in 2012 are as follows: Step 1: 91% and 94%, Step 2 CK: 96% and 97%, and Step 2 CS: 87% and 97%, respectively (this number may be misleading as only 46 DO students compared to 17,118 MD students were evaluated for Step 2 CS) Step 3: 100% and 95% (this number may be misleading, as only 16 DO students compared to 19,056 MD students, were evaluated for Step 3).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbme.org/PDF/Publications/2012Annual-Report.pdf |title=2012 Annual Report |date=2012 |publisher=National Board of Medical Examiners |access-date=20 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509144605/http://www.nbme.org/PDF/Publications/2012Annual-Report.pdf |archive-date=9 May 2013 }}</ref>

== Licensing and board certification ==
To obtain a license to practice medicine in the United States, osteopathic medical students must pass the [[Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination]] (COMLEX),<ref>{{cite web|title=Board Examinations and Licensure|url=http://www.aacom.org/resources/bookstore/cib/Documents/2012cib/2012cib-p11.pdf|work=Medical College Information Book, 2012 edition|publisher=AACOM|access-date=19 November 2012}}</ref> the licensure exam administered by the [[National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners]] throughout their medical training. Students are given the option of also taking the [[United States Medical Licensing Examination]] (USMLE) to apply for certain residency programs that may want USMLE scores in addition to COMLEX scores. Those that have received or are in the process of earning an MD or DO degree are both eligible to sit for the USMLE. Because of their additional training, only DO candidates are eligible to sit for the COMLEX.<ref>{{cite web|title=COMLEX-USA: Bulletin of Information|url=http://www.nbome.org/docs/comlexboi.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120916080523/http://www.nbome.org/docs/comlexBOI.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 September 2012|publisher=National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners|access-date=19 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Upon completion of internship and residency requirements for their chosen medical specialty, holders of the DO may elect to be board certified by either a specialty board (through the [[American Medical Association]]'s [[American Board of Medical Specialties]]) or an osteopathic specialty board (through the [[American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists]] certifying boards) or both. In February 2014, the [[American Osteopathic Association]] and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education agreed to unify allopathic and osteopathic [[graduate medical education]] starting in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|title=Allopathic and Osteopathic Medical Communities Commit to a Single Graduate Medical Education Accreditation System|url=https://www.acgme.org/acgmeweb/portals/0/PDFS/Nasca-Community/SingleAccreditationRelease2-26.pdf|publisher=Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education|access-date=3 March 2014}}</ref>

Depending on the state, medical licensure may be issued from a combined board (DO and MD) or a separate board of medical examiners.<ref name=DirectoryBoards>{{cite web|title=Directory of State Medical and Osteopathic Boards|url=http://www.fsmb.org/directory_smb.html|publisher=Federation of State Medical Boards|access-date=6 July 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709175748/http://www.fsmb.org/directory_smb.html|archive-date=9 July 2012}}</ref> All of the 70 state medical boards are members of the [[Federation of State Medical Boards]].<ref name=FSMB>{{cite web|title=Federation of State Medical Boards|url=http://www.fsmb.org/index.html|publisher=Federation of State Medical Boards|access-date=18 November 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115063540/http://www.fsmb.org/index.html|archive-date=15 November 2012}}</ref>

Retired MD and [[U.S. Air Force]] [[flight surgeon]] [[Harriet Hall]] stated that DOs trained in the U.S. are doctors of osteopathic medicine and are legally equivalent to MDs. "They must be distinguished from 'osteopaths', members of a less regulated or unregulated profession that is practiced in many countries. Osteopaths get inferior training that can't be compared to that of DOs."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=Harriet |author-link=Harriet Hall|title=Osteopathy Then and Now |journal=Skeptic |date=2021 |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=4â€“5 }}</ref>

== International variations ==
Currently, there are no osteopathic medical programs located outside of the United States that would qualify an individual to practice as an osteopathic physician in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aacom.org/about/osteomed/Pages/TheDifference.aspx |title=The Difference Between U.S.-Trained Osteopathic Physicians and Osteopaths Trained Abroad |date=2012 |publisher=American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine |access-date=17 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140927230152/http://www.aacom.org/about/osteomed/Pages/TheDifference.aspx |archive-date=27 September 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Foreign osteopathic degrees are not recognized by any state in the US as being equivalent to American DO degrees.

=== International practice rights ===
The International Labor Organization (ILO), an agency of the United Nations, issued a letter affirming that U.S.-trained osteopathic physicians are fully licensed physicians who prescribe medication and perform surgery. The acknowledgment draws a clear separation between American DOs, who are medical doctors, and non-physician osteopaths trained outside of the United States. Within the international standards that classify jobs to promote international comparability across occupations, U.S.-trained DOs are now categorized with all other physicians as medical doctors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thedo.osteopathic.org/2018/06/dos-receive-international-recognition-as-fully-licensed-physicians/|title=DOs receive international recognition as fully licensed physicians|date=2018-06-20|website=The DO|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref> This event took place in June 2018 and started a relay of events and opened doors for DOs as more countries started to understand and give full recognition to US-trained medical doctors with the DO degree, e.g. the Association of Medical Councils of Africa (AMCOA) approved a resolution in 2019 granting the AOA's request that AMCOA recognize U.S.-trained DOs as fully licensed physicians with practice rights equivalent to MDs, opening its 20 member countries, which include Botswana, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, South Africa, South Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe to DOs.<ref name="thedo.osteopathic.org">{{Cite web|url=https://thedo.osteopathic.org/2019/04/u-s-trained-dos-recognized-as-equal-to-mds-in-19-african-countries/|title=U.S.-trained DOs recognized as equal to MDs in 20 African countries|date=2019-04-10|website=The DO|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref> (Note: Some of the member African countries of AMCOA had independently licensed DOs before; however, this recognition unifies those who did or did not).
