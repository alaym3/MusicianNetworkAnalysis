'''Exodus''' is an American [[thrash metal]] band formed in 1979 in [[Richmond, California]].<ref name="Enter Night">{{cite book |last = Wall |first = Mick |title = Enter Night: A Biography of Metallica (page 119) |publisher = [[St. Martin's Press]] |date = May 10, 2011 |isbn = 978-0-312-64989-0}}</ref> Their current lineup consists of guitarists [[Gary Holt (musician)|Gary Holt]] and [[Lee Altus]], bassist Jack Gibson, drummer [[Tom Hunting]], and lead vocalist [[Steve Souza|Steve "Zetro" Souza]]. There are no original members left in Exodus other than Hunting, who has departed from the band twice, in 1989 and 2004, but rejoined in 2007. Exodus is also notable for being guitarist [[Kirk Hammett]]'s band before he left in 1983 to join [[Metallica]] as [[Dave Mustaine]]'s replacement. Holt, who replaced original guitarist Tim Agnello in 1981, has been most consistent member throughout various lineup changes and break-ups, and is the only member to be present on each Exodus release. Much of the band's career has also been affected by bitter feuds between both band members and record companies, two extended hiatuses, deaths of former band members and internal problems often relating to drugs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/beginner-s-guide-to-exodus|title=Beginner's Guide To Exodus|website=[[Metal Hammer|Loudersound.com]]|access-date=March 22, 2021}}</ref>

Since its formation, Exodus has released eleven studio albums, two live albums, one compilation album, and a [[Let There Be Blood|re-recording]] of their [[Bonded by Blood|first album]].

The critical praise given to ''Fabulous Disaster'' garnered attention from major labels, including [[Capitol Records]], with whom Exodus signed in 1989 and released two albums for the label: ''[[Impact Is Imminent]]'' (1990) and ''[[Force of Habit]]'' (1992). After a break up in 1993 and a short-lived reunion in 1997–1998, Exodus reunited once again in 2001, and since then, they have released six more studio albums, starting with and including ''[[Tempo of the Damned]]'' (2004), which reignited Exodus' popularity and is considered to be a key part in the early-to-mid-2000s thrash metal revival movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-10-best-thrash-songs-from-2000-18|title=The 10 best thrash songs from 2000-2020|publisher=[[Metal Hammer|Louder]]|date=July 31, 2018|access-date=January 23, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalmusicarchives.com/review/tempo-of-the-damned/252711|title=EXODUS Tempo of the Damned|publisher=Metal Music Archives|access-date=January 23, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.revolution-inc.dk/tekst/exodus|title=Revolution Music - Exodus|publisher=Revolution Music|access-date=January 23, 2021}}</ref> The band's eleventh and latest studio album, ''[[Persona Non Grata (Exodus album)|Persona Non Grata]]'', was released on November 19, 2021.<ref name="new album blabbermouth">{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/exodus-persona-non-grata-album-details-revealed-the-beatings-will-continue-single-now-available/|title=EXODUS: 'Persona Non Grata' Album Details Revealed; 'The Beatings Will Continue' Single Now Available|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=August 20, 2021}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation and early years (1979–1984)===
[[File:Gary Holt Slayer Kiev 03.JPG|thumb|right|Guitarist [[Gary Holt (musician)|Gary Holt]] has been a member of Exodus since 1981, and is the only member to have performed on all of the band's albums.]]

The initial lineup of Exodus was formed in the late 1970s by guitarists Kirk Hammett and Tim Agnello, drummer/vocalist Tom Hunting, and vocalist Keith Stewart, while they attended high school together.<ref>{{Cite web|last=magazine|first=chaospin|date=12 July 2020|title=Kirk Hammett reveals what he does before joined the Metallica|url=https://chaospin.com/kirk-hammett-reveals-what-he-does-before-join-metallica/|access-date=12 July 2020|website=Chaospin Magazine}}</ref> The band added bass guitarist Carlton Melson in 1980, and the quintet began making a name for themselves playing backyard parties and various school functions. They played mostly cover songs in the vein of 1970s hard rock and [[new wave of British heavy metal]] (NWOBHM) acts but also developed some of their own original songs. Stewart soon left the band and Hunting became the band's sole vocalist for some time. Carlton Melson was replaced in 1981 by bass guitarist Jeff Andrews.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pestwebzine.com/index/carlton_melson/0-1457|title=Pest Webzine - Carlton Melson|website=Pestwebzine.com|access-date=July 17, 2021}}</ref> Tim Agnello would also leave the group, moving to New York City and staying involved in the music industry as a guitar player, manager, and writer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmalliance.org/alife/you-can-call-me-al/|title=You Can Call Me AL|website=Cmalliance.org|access-date=July 17, 2021}}</ref> This left Exodus to perform as a power trio until a replacement was found in Hammett's friend and Exodus roadie [[Gary Holt (musician)|Gary Holt]].<ref name="factorfiction">{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvMDgl0z_ZA|title = Exodus / Slayer's Gary Holt – Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?|date = April 8, 2015|access-date = November 18, 2015|website = YouTube|publisher = LoudWire}}</ref>

Also in 1981, Hammett met [[El Cerrito, California|El Cerrito]] resident [[Paul Baloff]] at a [[North Berkeley, Berkeley, California|North Berkeley]] [[house party]], a friendship that was started – according to Hammett – by their shared admiration for [[punk rock]] and 1970s [[heavy metal music]]. Baloff became the band's lead vocalist and the quintet recorded a 3-track demo tape in 1982 consisting of the songs "Whipping Queen", "Death and Domination" and "Warlord", a release which would be Hammett's only recording with Exodus until 2014. The band's music began to incorporate elements of [[hardcore punk]] into their NWOBHM roots, and Exodus was considered a pioneer of the [[Bay Area thrash metal]] scene. In November 1982, Exodus opened a show at San Francisco's [[Old Waldorf]] venue for [[Metallica]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encycmet.com/live/26.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604222532/http://encycmet.com/live/26.shtml|url-status=dead|title=ENCYCLOPEDIA METALLICA – Concert Info: San Francisco, Old Waldorf California Nov 29, 1982|archive-date=June 4, 2009|access-date=July 17, 2021}}</ref> a then-relatively unknown (and unsigned) band from Los Angeles. As the band began playing more shows in [[Bay Area thrash metal#Notable venues|Bay Area clubs]], they gained a large, fervent fan base known for their violent concert behavior.

In early 1983, Hammett left Exodus to join [[Metallica]] on the recommendation of manager / producer [[Mark Whitaker (record producer)|Mark Whitaker]], leaving Gary Holt to effectively take creative control of the band. Hammett was replaced short term by Mike Maung, followed by [[Evan McCaskey]], before the band finally found a permanent replacement in guitarist Rick Hunolt. Jeff Andrews also left to start an early incarnation of pioneering [[death metal]] band [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]], and was replaced by bass guitarist Rob McKillop.

In the spring of 1984, Exodus entered Turk Street Studios with producer [[Doug Piercy]] to record demos of songs that would later appear on their debut album. The band was signed to New York-based Torrid Records and Exodus prepared to enter [[Prairie Sun Recording Studios]] that summer.

===''Bonded By Blood'' and rise in popularity (1984–1991)===
[[File:Paul Baloff.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Vocalist [[Paul Baloff]], who appeared on the first Exodus album ''[[Bonded by Blood]]'', was the band's singer from 1982 to 1986, and returned to the band twice, in 1997–1998 and 2001–2002.]]
The band recorded their first album, ''[[Bonded by Blood]]'', in the summer of 1984 with the band's manager Mark Whitaker producing. Concert photos from 1984 showing them at [[Aquatic Park (Berkeley)|Aquatic Park]]'s [[Bay Area thrash metal#Aquatic Park, Berkeley|Eastern Front Metal Festival]] (with [[Slayer]] and [[Suicidal Tendencies]]) and at [[Bay Area thrash metal#Ruthie's Inn, Berkeley|Ruthie's Inn]] (with Megadeth and Slayer) were included on the album sleeve inserts. Originally titled ''A Lesson in Violence'', the album was not released until April 1985 amidst creative and business setbacks. Whilst ''Bonded By Blood'' is considered a highly influential [[thrash metal]] album today, critics have regarded the delay in its release as having hindered the impact the album could have had. As Allmusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia would later write in his review for the album: "Had it been released immediately after it was recorded in 1984, Exodus' ''Bonded by Blood'' might be regarded today alongside Metallica's ''[[Kill 'Em All]]'' as one of the landmark albums responsible for launching the thrash metal wave."<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web|author=Eduardo Rivadavia |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/bonded-by-blood-mw0000192933 |title=Bonded by Blood – Exodus &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=March 28, 2016}}</ref> Exodus promoted the album by going on tour with [[Venom (band)|Venom]] and Slayer. Four songs from their performance of April 5, 1985 at Studio 54 in New York City were filmed and released on home video as ''Combat Tour Live: The Ultimate Revenge''. The band subsequently toured or played selected shows with bands like [[Exciter (band)|Exciter]], Megadeth, Anthrax, [[King Diamond (band)|King Diamond]], Possessed, [[Dirty Rotten Imbeciles|D.R.I.]], [[Nuclear Assault]] and [[Hirax]].
[[File:Exodus Rockharz 2018 30.jpg|thumb|right|Vocalist [[Steve Souza|Steve "Zetro" Souza]], who replaced Paul Baloff, was a member of Exodus from 1986 to their first breakup in 1994, and again from 2002 to 2004. He rejoined the band once again in 2014.]]

Shortly after touring for ''Bonded by Blood'' was complete, Paul Baloff was fired from the band allegedly due to his behavior related to alcohol and substance abuse. He was replaced by [[Steve Souza|Steve "Zetro" Souza]], who had previously been the lead vocalist for Legacy, an early incarnation of fellow Bay Area thrashers [[Testament (band)|Testament]]. Baloff went on to form the band Piranha in 1987.

Exodus' line-up remained stable for the recording of their next two albums, and the underground success attained with ''Bonded by Blood'' would lead to the group's signing to [[Sony Music|Sony]]/[[Combat Records]], who released the band's second effort ''[[Pleasures of the Flesh]]'' in October 1987. The album was engineered by then-unknown [[Sylvia Massy]], who would go on to produce two releases by progressive metal band [[Tool (band)|Tool]]. In support of ''Pleasures of the Flesh'', Exodus toured with the likes of Anthrax, [[Celtic Frost]], [[M.O.D.]], [[Lȧȧz Rockit]] and Testament.

''[[Fabulous Disaster]]'', the group's third full-length album, was released in January 1989. A [[music video]] for the song "[[The Toxic Waltz (song)|The Toxic Waltz]]" would receive consistent rotation on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Headbangers Ball]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revolvermag.com/magazine/article/the-history-of-american-thrash |title=The History of American Thrash |publisher=[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver.com]] |access-date=September 19, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125083043/http://www.revolvermag.com/magazine/article/the-history-of-american-thrash |archive-date=November 25, 2010}}</ref> Promotion for the album included Exodus embarking on the [[Headbangers Ball Tour]] with Anthrax and [[Helloween]], which brought the band to a wider audience. Early in the tour, drummer Tom Hunting left the band for health and personal reasons. [[Vio-lence]] drummer Perry Strickland was quickly brought into the fold as a temporary replacement for the remainder of the tour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3x86C4f5u2A| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/3x86C4f5u2A| archive-date=2021-11-17 | url-status=live|title=Zetro's Toxic Vault - Perry Strickland 2 of 3|access-date=July 17, 2021|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Drummer [[John Tempesta]] would fill the position on a permanent basis until the band's first breakup in 1993.

After the success of ''Fabulous Disaster'', Exodus signed a multi-album deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1989. The band's fourth album ''[[Impact is Imminent]]'' was released in June 1990. Despite being released on a major label, ''Impact Is Imminent'' was not as successful as ''[[Fabulous Disaster]]'' and debuted at No. 137 on the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref name="allmusic charts">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/search/artists/exodus|title=Artist Search for "exodus"|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=July 17, 2021}}</ref> Until the release of ''[[Blood In, Blood Out (Exodus album)|Blood In, Blood Out]]'' in 2014, ''Impact Is Imminent'' would be Exodus' last album to enter the charts.<ref name="allmusic charts"/> Exodus spent the latter half of 1990 touring in support of the album with [[Suicidal Tendencies]] and [[Pantera]] in the U.S. and in Europe with [[Flotsam and Jetsam (band)|Flotsam and Jetsam]], [[Vio-lence]] and [[Forbidden (band)|Forbidden]].

In 1991, the band released their first live album, ''[[Good Friendly Violent Fun]]'', which was recorded during their 1989 tour.

===''Force of Habit'', hiatus, and temporary reunion (1991–2000)===
[[File:Exodus Rockharz 2018 33.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Jack Gibson joined Exodus in 1997 as bass guitarist and has been with the group ever since.]]

After the release of ''Good Friendly Violent Fun'', the band toured sporadically for a year. Bass guitarist McKillop was replaced by Michael Butler before the group recorded and released their next studio album titled ''[[Force of Habit]]'' in 1992. This album was something of a departure from the band's signature sound, containing several slower, "heavier" songs with less emphasis on the thrash aspect of their older material. The 11-minute song "Architect of Pain" is a good example of the change of direction, having a much slower, grinding feel than the usual high tempo thrash they had become known for. After touring for ''Force of Habit'' was completed, behind-the-scenes issues as well as a changing musical environment prompted the band to split up.

Holt and Hunting formed the groove / thrash metal outfit Wardance in the mid 1990s playing several shows around the Bay Area and recording a 4-song demo, but the group never gained momentum and eventually disbanded.

Holt and Hunting reunited with Paul Baloff and Rick Hunolt for a short Exodus tour in 1997. The lineup was completed with Wardance bassist Jack Gibson. They released a live album titled ''[[Another Lesson in Violence]]'' recorded at the [[Trocadero Transfer]] in front of a home town audience. However, the group disbanded again the following year, in part due to a falling out with record label Century Media over the way promotion for the live album was handled, and over an aborted attempt at a live concert video which was filmed but never released due to a financial dispute.

===Second reformation, death of Paul Baloff and ''Tempo of the Damned'' (2001–2004)===
In 2001, Exodus reformed once again with the 1997 lineup, initially to play the [[Chuck Billy (vocalist)|Chuck Billy]] and [[Chuck Schuldiner]] benefit [[Thrash of the Titans]] concert. There was talk of recording a new studio album and the band continued to play shows in and around the San Francisco Bay Area.

However, on February 2, 2002, Paul Baloff died after suffering a stroke. Former vocalist Steve Souza was brought back into the band to finish the rest of their concert commitments. Although it appeared to outsiders that with Baloff's death Exodus would cease to exist, guitarist Gary Holt was determined to release a new studio album. The result was 2004's ''[[Tempo of the Damned]]'' released on [[Nuclear Blast Records]]. An oddity of the recording sessions was that one track, "Crime of the Century", was dropped under mysterious circumstances. The song chronicled Exodus's time under Century Media (of which Nuclear Blast is a subsidiary). Although it was publicly denied, rumors swirled that Century Media forced the song off the record. "Crime of the Century" was replaced with "Impaler", a song which was written when Kirk Hammett was still in the band, and was previously featured on the ''Another Lesson in Violence'' live record. Despite selling fewer than 15,000 copies in its first year of release,{{r|fullinbloommusic.com}} ''Tempo of the Damned'' received generally positive reviews from fans and critics alike, and is now considered to be an important part of the 2000s thrash metal revival movement. Throughout 2004, Exodus toured worldwide in support of the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/exodus-to-tour-europe-in-june/|title=EXODUS To Tour Europe In June|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=January 23, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/exodus-u-s-tour-dates-announced/|title=EXODUS: U.S. Tour Dates Announced|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=January 23, 2021}}</ref>

Tom Hunting also took leave of the band following a re-occurrence of the nervous problems that led to his temporary departure in 1989. Hunting was replaced with [[Paul Bostaph]] who had previously played with Slayer and Testament. The revamped line up released the album ''[[Shovel Headed Kill Machine]]'' in 2005. The tour for the album led to extensive travel of the US, Europe, and Japan, as well as their first-ever visit to Australia.

Tom Hunting returned to the band in March 2007 in time to record and release their 8th studio album ''[[The Atrocity Exhibition... Exhibit A]]''. They performed at the [[Wacken Open Air]] Festival in the summer of 2008. In April 2009, Exodus embarked on a co-headlining North American tour with [[Kreator]] and also featuring [[Belphegor (band)|Belphegor]], [[Warbringer]], and Epicurean. Exodus then went on tour supporting [[Arch Enemy]] along with [[Arsis]] and [[Mutiny Within]].

Exodus provided the voices of the customers at the Duncan Hills Coffee Shop and five of the sick people in [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Metalocalypse]]''.

Exodus released a re-recording of their 1985 debut album ''Bonded by Blood'' entitled ''[[Let There Be Blood]]'' in 2008. Gary Holt released the following statement about the band's decision to revisit their debut album: "After many years in the planning and discussion stage, we have finally completed the re-recording of 'Bonded By Blood'. We have decided to call it 'Let There Be Blood' and it is our way of paying homage to [late singer] Paul Baloff by showing how relevant these songs we had written together still are. We aren't trying to replace the original; that's impossible anyway. We are just giving these songs the benefit of modern production. It's something we talked about before Paul's death and it's always been important to us to do. We were super excited about entering the studio once again to record these classics, and now it's back to writing the next studio record!"{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The album ''[[Exhibit B: The Human Condition]]'' was recorded in northern California with British producer Andy Sneap (Megadeth, Arch Enemy, Kreator) and released on Nuclear Blast Records in May 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=134987 |title=Exodus: New Album Pushed Back To May - Blabbermouth.net |website=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date=February 12, 2010 |access-date=March 28, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606063706/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=134987 |archive-date=June 6, 2011}}</ref> The band were included on Megadeth's ''[[Rust in Peace]]'' 20th Anniversary tour along with Testament.

[[Loudwire|Loudwire.com]] placed Exodus at number five on its list of the 10 Best Thrash Bands of All Time, calling them "The original kings of the Bay Area thrash scene", and saying that "While their uncompromising sound and uneven output in the coming decades kept world domination and platinum success ever at bay, you'd be hard passed to finger any other band, short of Slayer, perhaps, that's flown the thrash flag as proudly and unwaveringly as Exodus."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/best-thrash-metal-bands/|title=10 Best Thrash Metal Bands of All Time|publisher=[[Loudwire|Loudwire.com]]|date=August 15, 2013|access-date=January 26, 2017}}</ref> In 1989, [[Brad Tolinski]] of ''[[Guitar World]]'' magazine wrote that, "If Exodus is a speed metal equivalent of [[the Rolling Stones]], then New York-based [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] must surely be the genre's [[The Beatles|Beatles]]."<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Tolinski |first=Brad |date=October 1989 |title=Speed Kills |magazine=[[Guitar World]] |page=70 }}</ref> In 2002, Jon Wiederhorn of [[MTV]] noted that Exodus "was instrumental in pioneering thrash metal — a style of music that blended the fury of hardcore and the razor-edged precision of such British bands as Iron Maiden and Judas Priest — and soon became the toast of the Bay Area metal scene, which also included Metallica, Testament, [[Flotsam and Jetsam (band)|Flotsam & Jetsam]] and Death Angel."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1452131/thrash-metal-pioneer-paul-baloff-dies-of-stroke/|title=Thrash Metal Pioneer Paul Baloff Dies Of Stroke|publisher=[[MTV|MTV.com]]|date=February 4, 2002|access-date=October 2, 2021}}</ref>

==="Big Four" debate===
It has been debated whether or not Exodus belongs in the "Big Five" of thrash metal with Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer and Anthrax, due to their involvement with the early 1980s thrash metal scene. [[VH1]] stated, "Much is made of Thrash's Big Four: Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax. True devotees know, however, that Big Five is the actual proper figure and that Exodus is the band that completes the quintet."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/25827/10-greatest-thrash-metal-debut-albums/|title=10 Greatest Thrash Metal Debut Albums Of All Time|publisher=[[VH1|VH1.com]]|date=June 11, 2015|access-date=January 30, 2017}}</ref> Anthrax guitarist [[Scott Ian]] also stated that, "People talk about the 'Big Four' all the time, but back then it was really the 'Big Five' because Exodus were just as important and just as influential as everybody else." Megadeth founder [[Dave Mustaine]] said in a 1990 interview that, in his point of view, the "Big Four" were Exodus, Slayer, Metallica and Megadeth, adding that "Exodus are a much better band – I really like Exodus. Gary Holt and Rick Hunolt are really great guitar players. I like Scott Ian, but anyone else in that band kind of bores me. Having a disco thing is not what I think having a metal band is all about, and that guy had the audacity to say that he and I should together! I felt like saying what are you planning to do? Open a disco fashion shop?"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://megadeth.rockmetal.art.pl/articles_hotmetal1990.html|title=The Big Four|publisher=megadeth.rockmetal.art.pl|date=September 1990|access-date=January 30, 2017}}</ref>

Along with Ian and Mustaine,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/anthrax-guitarist-says-expanded-big-four-should-include-exodus/|title=Anthrax Guitarist Says Expanded 'Big Four' Should Include Exodus|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=September 18, 2012|access-date=January 30, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/dave-mustaine-says-exodus-would-have-been-most-qualified-candidate-for-expanded-big-four-2/|title=Dave Mustaine Says Exodus Would Have Been Most Qualified Candidate For Expanded 'Big Four'|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=July 6, 2013|access-date=January 30, 2017}}</ref> Holt has agreed that Exodus should be included in the "Big Five" of thrash metal because they "were there at the start of thrash metal with Metallica in the real early '80s. Same thing with Megadeth because Mustaine was a part of Metallica's birth and he also created Megadeth."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/gary-holt-says-big-four-should-be-expanded-to-include-exodus-we-were-there-at-the-start/|title=Gary Holt Says 'Big Four' Should be Expanded To Include Exodus: 'We Were There At The Start'|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=May 6, 2010|access-date=January 30, 2017}}</ref> Frontman Steve "Zetro" Souza has stated that the fact that Exodus was not included in the "Big Four" does not bother him, "I've heard that term many times and it doesn't really matter to me. It's not the truth. There's them, and Overkill, Testament and Exodus. You could also talk about Kreator, Sodom and [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]], if you want to get down to it. It doesn't bother me — I'm content where I'm at."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/steve-zetro-souza-isnt-bothered-by-exodus-not-being-part-of-big-four-it-doesnt-really-matter-to-me/|title=STEVE 'ZETRO' SOUZA Isn't Bothered By EXODUS Not Being Part Of 'Big Four': 'It Doesn't Really Matter To Me'|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=September 5, 2017|access-date=September 17, 2017}}</ref>
