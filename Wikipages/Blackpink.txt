=== 2010–2016: Formation and pre-debut activities ===
Blackpink began forming when [[YG Entertainment]] held tryouts worldwide for preteen or teenage recruits to create a new girl group after launching its first major girl group, [[2NE1]], in 2009. According to the members, joining the label as [[Korean idol#Trainee system|trainees]] was similar to enrolling in a full-time pop-star academy, with Jennie describing the experience as "more strict than school" and Rosé comparing it to ''[[The X Factor]]'' with dorm rooms. For members who had left their lives outside of [[South Korea]], the pace of training alongside the culture shock was especially difficult.<ref name=bbcover>{{cite magazine|first=Nolan|last=Feeney|date=February 28, 2019|title=Inside Blackpink's U.S. Takeover: How the K-Pop Queens Are Changing the Game|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/cover-story/8500312/blackpink-billboard-cover-story-2019|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=July 11, 2020|archive-date=November 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201108213447/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/cover-story/8500312/blackpink-billboard-cover-story-2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Preparations for Blackpink's debut began as early as 2011, when YG Entertainment revealed on November 14 that their new girl group would debut in the early half of 2012 and feature at least seven members.<ref>{{cite web|date=November 11, 2011|title=Super Star K2's Kim Eun-bi To Debut As YG Entertainment Group|url=http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/program/program_musicnews_frame.htm?No=16752&current_page=165|website=[[KBS World]]|access-date=July 11, 2020|archive-date=October 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201021085231/http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/program/program_musicnews_frame.htm?No=16752&current_page=165|url-status=live}}</ref> Since then, numerous news and rumors surfaced surrounding the new girl group's debut being delayed, although there had been no official information.<ref>{{cite web|date=September 3, 2012|title=G-Dragon turns producer for YG's new girl group|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20120903001229|website=[[The Korea Herald]]|access-date=July 11, 2020|archive-date=July 12, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200712063040/http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20120903001229|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=February 26, 2013|title=YG Entertainment Delays New Girl Group Debut Yet Again|url=https://www.popdust.com/nazi-chic-2629432175.html|website=Popdust|access-date=July 11, 2020|archive-date=June 1, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210601183050/https://www.popdust.com/nazi-chic-2629432175.html|url-status=live}}</ref> It was only until May 18, 2016, that YG Entertainment confirmed the girl group would debut that July, stating that the members were selected through years of stiff competition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=109&aid=0003320557|title=[단독]2NE1 데뷔 후 7년, YG 걸그룹 자매의 탄생|date=May 18, 2016|website=Naver|publisher=Osen|language=ko|access-date=August 1, 2020|archive-date=October 31, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201031142249/https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=109&aid=0003320557|url-status=live}}</ref> The label later confirmed that Jang Hanna and Moon Sua, who were introduced to the public as potential members of the new girl group, were not included in the lineup.<ref>{{Cite web|title=[단독] YG 신인 걸그룹..'1순위'라던 장한나 없다 '확인'|url=https://entertain.v.daum.net/v/20160519114704566|date=May 19, 2016|website=Daum|publisher=Ilgan Sports|language=ko|access-date=August 1, 2020|archive-date=October 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201029191316/https://entertain.v.daum.net/v/20160519114704566|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title='언프리티' 문수아도 YG 新걸그룹 NO "새 인물多"|url=https://entertain.v.daum.net/v/20160520093438960|date=May 20, 2016|website=Daum|publisher=Star News|language=ko|access-date=August 1, 2020|archive-date=November 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201108181308/https://entertain.v.daum.net/v/20160520093438960|url-status=live}}</ref>
