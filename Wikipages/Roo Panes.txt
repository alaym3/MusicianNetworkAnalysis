'''Andrew "Roo" Panes''' (born 8 June 1988 in Wimborne, Dorset, England) is an English folk singer-songwriter and model. He has released three EPs: ''Once'' (2012), ''Weight of Your World'' (2012), and ''Land of the Living'' (2013). His début LP ''Little Giant'' was released in Autumn 2014, with the leading single "Tiger Striped Sky" previously released on 23 June 2014. His follow-up album ''Paperweights'' came in 2016. His third album ''Quiet Man'' arrived in 2018, with a deluxe edition released in the following year. Panes plays a 12-string acoustic guitar.  Introspective lyrics and a band of string-players contribute to a genre of classical folk music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b081mwqz|title=Roo Panes in Session, Jo Whiley – BBC Radio 2|publisher=BBC|access-date=14 December 2016}}</ref>

Panes gained a wide audience in 2012 after participating in a campaign for [[Burberry]] as he joined actress Gabriella Wilde as Burberry label's new campaign star.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/roo-panes-burberry-interview-music-and-style|title=Meet Roo|website=British Vogue|accessdate=15 July 2020}}</ref> The contract also included recording music for Burberry Acoustic and modelling.

==Background==
Panes comes from a musical background, his grandmother was a classical pianist and his mother studied performing arts at [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama]] and then worked in theatre.<ref>[https://www.forfolkssake.com/blog/31316/guest-blog-roo-panes-on-his-musical-upbringing Guest Blog | Roo Panes on his musical upbringing] For Folk's Sake. 23 March 2015</ref> His twin sister is a photographer and his older sister is an illustrator that has developed and designed the artwork for all of his albums.<ref>[https://scenestr.com.au/music/roo-panes-jumps-at-the-chance-to-tour-australia Roo Panes jumps at the chance to tour Australia] Scenestr. 4 March 2017</ref>

Panes received the nickname 'Roo' after falling into a river as a child. It was also a homage to a [[Winnie-the-Pooh]] character who met a similar fate while playing a game called [[Poohsticks]].
