'''Oscar Seagle''' (October 31, 1877 - December 19, 1945) was a prominent musician and music teacher active in the early 20th century.<ref name=obit/>  He founded the [[Seagle Music Colony]] in [[Schroon Lake (hamlet), New York|Schroon Lake, New York]].<ref name="seaglecolony.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.seaglecolony.org/History|title=our history - Seagle Music Colony|work=seaglecolony.org}}</ref>

==Early life==
He was born on October 31, 1877 on [[Ooltewah, Tennessee]].<ref>He used October 31, 1877 in the [[World War II]] draft registration and his passport application from October 4, 1922. He used "October 31, 1878 in Ooltewah, Tennessee" in the [[World War I]] draft registration. He uses one or the other date evenly on various ship's manifests. His parents used "October 1877" in the [[1900 United States Census]] and as the earliest document, it is the most likely correct one.</ref>
