'''Los Bukis''' (The Bukis, ''buki'' translates as ''Little Kid'' in the [[Yaqui language]]) are a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Grupera]]  band from [[Ario de Rosales]], [[Michoacan]]. In 1975, the band was founded by cousins [[Marco Antonio Solís]] and Joel Solís. Their first song was ''Falso Amor'' ("False Love") and its style became popular throughout Latin America. Marco Antonio wrote the songs; the album "Me Volvi a Acordar de Ti" in the year of 1987 sold one million records in just a few weeks after its launch, earning the album "diamond" status. He also wrote and produced albums for artists such as [[Marisela]], [[Rocío Dúrcal]], [[Beatriz Adriana]], [[Lucero (entertainer)|Lucero]], El Pegasso de Emilio Reyna (now using the name El Pega Pega) and [[María Sorté]].

After twenty years of success, in 1996, Marco decided to pursue a solo career. The band disbanded. An agreement was made with the remaining band members, under which both parties agreed to not make any use of the word "buki". The remaining members formed a new band called [[Los Mismos]] ("The Same Ones") as in "the same members of Los Bukis".

== Reunion Tour ==
After a 25 year hiatus, on May 9, 2021 Los Bukis reunited and released a re-recording and music video of their 1986 hit “Tú Cárcel” with Marco Antonio Solís, Joel Solis, Roberto Guadarrama, Eusebio Cortez, Jose Javier Solis, and Pedro Sanchez in the lineup. A few weeks later, Jose "Pepe" Guadarrama also rejoined the band. On June 14, 2021 Los Bukis were presented at [[SoFi Stadium]] and announced a reunion tour. They named the tour Una Historia Cantada. The tour was originally for only four dates, but expanded to nine due to high demand, performing mainly in California and Texas. They finished their tour in Oakland California on October 2, 2021
