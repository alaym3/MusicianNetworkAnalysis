By this time, she had also learned to play the guitar, ukulele, saxophone, and flute.<ref name="Lebo Mag" /> Daya also spent a summer studying songwriting at [[Interlochen Center for the Arts|Interlochen Arts Camp]].

At eleven, Daya enrolled as a student at the Accelerando Music Conservatory, owned by Christina Chirumbolo,<ref>{{cite web|title = Accelerando|url = http://www.accelerandopittsburgh.com|website = www.accelerandopittsburgh.com|access-date = January 7, 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181001091606/https://www.accelerandopittsburgh.com/|archive-date = October 1, 2018|url-status = dead}}</ref> in Pittsburgh. There, she met songwriter and producer Gino Barletta,<ref name="106.9 The Q" /> a colleague of Chirumbolo who visited the school as a lecturer. Chirumbolo and Barletta founded ''INSIDE ACCESS'', a music camp, the two worked with Daya eventually inviting her to Los Angeles in February 2015 to work on her original material.

==Music career==
Daya's professional career began when her parents accompanied her to Los Angeles to work with Christina Chirumbolo and Gino Barletta, founders of INSIDE ACCESS by Accelerando, [[Leland (musician)|Brett McLaughlin]], Britten Newbill and Noisecastle III at [[Paramount Records|Paramount Recording Studios]]. It was during one of these writing sessions that her debut single "Hide Away" was written and recorded, and Barletta consequently introduced Daya to Steve Zap of Z Entertainment.
