'''Sparks''' (formerly '''Halfnelson''') is an American [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music|rock]] duo formed by brothers [[Ron Mael|Ron]] (keyboards) and [[Russell Mael]] (vocals) in Los Angeles. Known for their quirky approach to songwriting,<ref name="NPR">{{cite web | author= Dye, David | year=2006 | title=Sparks: Elegantly Whimsical | publisher=Npr.org |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5555691|access-date=2006-09-24}}</ref> Sparks' music is often accompanied by sophisticated and [[wikt:acerbic|acerbic]] lyrics, often about women or Shakespearean literature references,<ref name="LAWeekly">{{cite news|title=Shooting Off Sparks |newspaper=LA Weekly |author=Alfvegren, Skylaire |date=1998-11-04 |url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/music/shooting-off-sparks/12237/ |access-date=2006-04-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207233516/http://www.laweekly.com/music/music/shooting-off-sparks/12237/ |archive-date=2006-12-07 }}</ref> and an idiosyncratic, theatrical stage presence, typified in the contrast between Russell's animated, hyperactive frontman antics and Ron's [[deadpan]] scowling. They are also noted for Russell Mael's distinctive wide-ranging voice and Ron Mael's intricate and rhythmic keyboard playing style. They have been much more successful in Europe than in their native US, though they maintain a loyal [[cult following]] in the States.

Early career highlights included "[[This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us]]", which reached No. 2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1974; the disco hit "[[The Number One Song in Heaven]]" in 1979, resulting from a collaboration with [[Giorgio Moroder]] and marking a stylistic shift towards [[new wave music|new wave]]/[[synth-pop]]; "When I'm With You", which topped the Australian and French Singles Charts in 1980; the single "[[I Predict]]", which provided Sparks' first appearance on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], reaching No. 60 in May 1982; the 1983 single "[[Cool Places]]" with [[the Go-Go's]] rhythm guitarist and co vocalist [[Jane Wiedlin]], and "[[When Do I Get to Sing 'My Way']]{{-"}}, which was the top airplay record in Germany for 1994.<ref name="Epitonic">{{cite web|author=Ashlock, Jesse |year=2003 |title=Sparks profile |work=Epitonic.com |url=http://www.epitonic.com/index.jsp?refer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.epitonic.com%2Fartists%2Fsparks.html |access-date=2006-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927185033/http://www.epitonic.com/index.jsp?refer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.epitonic.com%2Fartists%2Fsparks.html |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 2015, the band released an album with Scottish [[indie rock]] band [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]], as the supergroup [[FFS (band)|FFS]], titled ''[[FFS (album)|FFS]]''. In 2017, returning to a rock-group format, Sparks released ''[[Hippopotamus (album)|Hippopotamus]]'', which entered the [[UK Albums Chart]] at no. 7,<ref name=OCCFirstTopTenIn40Years>{{cite web|title=The National secure their first Number 1 on the Official Albums Chart with Sleep Well Beast: 'It means a lot'|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-national-secure-their-first-number-1-on-the-official-albums-chart-with-sleep-well-beast-it-means-a-lot__20438/|first=Rob|last=Copsey|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|date=September 15, 2017|access-date=September 16, 2017}}</ref> as did their next album, ''[[A Steady Drip, Drip, Drip]]'', released in 2020, bringing their tally of UK Top 10 albums to four.

==History==
===Inception===
Brothers Ron and Russell Mael grew up in [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]], in west [[Los Angeles County, California]],<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|author= Encyclopedia of Popular Music | title=Sparks | work=BBC.co.uk | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cgi-perl/music/muze/index.pl?site=music&action=biography&artist_id=764086 | access-date=2006-04-13}}{{dead link|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cgi-perl/music/muze/index.pl?site=music&action=biography&artist_id=764086|date=June 2009}}</ref> during the "Golden Age" of the LA club scene, with [[the Doors]], [[Love (band)|Love]] and [[the Standells]] regularly playing the [[Whisky a Go Go]] on [[Sunset Strip]] and [[the Beach Boys]] playing the afternoon event Teenage Fair.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news| last= Hodgkinson| first= Will | title=Sparks Interview | work=Arts Guide | publisher=Guardian Newspaper|date=2002-11-01 |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/fridayreview/story/0,,823087,00.html|access-date=2006-04-13}}</ref>
Both Ron and Russell Mael are seen in the audience during [[the Ronettes]]' section of the concert film ''[[The Big T.N.T. Show]]'', filmed in 1966. Both attended [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], Ron studying cinema and graphic art and Russell, theatre arts and filmmaking. Detesting the [[folk music]] scene, which they considered "cerebral and sedate and we had no time for that",<ref name="Guardian"/> they developed a particular taste in English bands of the time such as [[the Who]], [[Syd Barrett]]'s [[Pink Floyd]], [[the Kinks]] and [[the Move]], which led to their description of themselves as [[Anglophile|"Anglophiles"]].<ref name="Guardian"/>

Their very first recordings were made under the name of "Urban Renewal Project", on January 14, 1967, at the Fidelity Recording Studios in Hollywood. Four tracks were recorded with married couple Fred and Ronna Frank, who were close friends of the Maels at the time. The songs were pressed on two acetates and have never been released, apart from the track "Computer Girl", which was featured on a CD included with the Japanese semi-biography from 2006 and more widely released on the ''Past Tense'' greatest hits album in 2019. The other three tracks were entitled "The Windmill", "A Quick Thought" and "As You Like It". Of all four songs, "Computer Girl" was the least traditional.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Forming Halfnelson in 1968, they soon came to the attention of producer [[Todd Rundgren]], at whose urging [[Albert Grossman]] signed the band to his [[Bearsville Records|Bearsville]] record label. Their [[Halfnelson (album)|debut album]] was released on Bearsville Records in 1971 with the line-up consisting of college friend [[Earle Mankey]] on guitar, Mankey's brother [[James Mankey|James]] on bass, Harley Feinstein on drums and Rundgren producing{{nbsp}}. It sold poorly, but after renaming themselves Sparks in 1972, a play on the [[Marx Brothers]],<ref name="AllSparks">{{cite web|title=Sparkography on allsparks.com|url=http://allsparks.com/sparkography/|access-date=2006-04-15}}</ref> the album was then re-released by Bearsville Records in 1972 as Sparks. The re-issued debut spawned the minor regional hit "Wonder Girl".

Their follow-up album, ''[[A Woofer in Tweeter's Clothing]]'', led to a tour of the United Kingdom, including a residency at the [[Marquee Club]] in [[London]],<ref name="RecordCollector"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.queenconcerts.com/detail/live/37/queen-live-20-12-1972-the-marquee-club-london-uk.html|title=Concert: Queen live at The Marquee Club, London, UK |date=20 December 1972|website=Queenconcerts.com}}</ref> These London appearances helped them to secure a significant cult following.<ref name="BBC"/>

Sparks became a UK teen sensation appearing on the cover of ''Melody Maker'', ''[[Record Mirror]]'' and countless other pop magazines in the UK and Europe. Hits such as "This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us", "[[Amateur Hour (song)|Amateur Hour]]" and "[[Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth]]" led to many appearances on the [[BBC]]'s flagship music show ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. Russell's hyperactive movements were in sharp contrast to the keyboard-bound, soberly dressed Ron's expressionless squint and [[Charlie Chaplin]]-esque moustache.

Gordon and Fisher were later replaced by Trevor White and Ian Hampton. In 1975, the revised band returned to the US to tour supporting the ''Kimono'' and ''Propaganda'' albums which had gained strong cult attention in [[New York City]], [[Cleveland]], [[Chicago]], [[San Francisco]] and Los Angeles primarily from FM radio play and a national TV appearance on [[Don Kirshner's Rock Concert]]. [[Flo & Eddie]] were the supporting act. Influential 1970s progressive FM radio station powerhouse [[WMMS]] in Cleveland and its famed DJs such as [[Kid Leo]] initially championed the band in America. Sparks also performed on [[American Bandstand]] in 1975 with host [[Dick Clark]] mugging with Ron and on countless other TV shows in the US and abroad post 1977.

The follow-up albums, [[Propaganda (Sparks album)|Propaganda]] and ''[[Indiscreet (Sparks album)|Indiscreet]]'', the latter produced by [[Tony Visconti]], were similarly successful and produced the hit singles "Looks, Looks, Looks", "[[Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth]]" and "Something for the Girl with Everything".<ref name="BBC"/>

===Return home===
The Maels returned home to Los Angeles in 1976. Concerned that their music may have become stale, they adopted a more "American" sound and recorded ''[[Big Beat (album)|Big Beat]]'' with [[Rupert Holmes]] and Jeffrey Lesser on production, which they followed with ''[[Introducing Sparks]];'' both albums were mostly recorded with session musicians. This new "West Coast" sound yielded such songs as "Nothing to Do", "Everybody's Stupid", and "Throw Her Away (and Get a New One)". In 1976, Sparks made one of their first forays into the movie business, making a cameo appearance in the disaster-suspense film ''[[Rollercoaster (1977 film)|Rollercoaster]]'', after [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] turned down the roles.<ref name="Mojo2">{{cite magazine | last= Black| first= Johnny | title=Sparks Interview |date=September 2006|magazine=Mojo Magazine Issue|volume=154}}</ref> They performed the songs "Fill 'Er Up" and "Big Boy".

By 1977 the brothers found themselves at a crossroads. They had grown tired of recording within a traditional rock band framework and were determined to take their music in a more electronic direction. In a conversation with a German journalist, they expressed their admiration for [[Giorgio Moroder]], a pioneer of electronic disco and pop music. Moroder happened to be a friend of the journalist, and he was able to connect the brothers with the Italian producer, who produced their next album, ''[[No. 1 in Heaven]].'' More synthesizer-based than their previous efforts, the album would redefine Sparks' sound and challenge the concept of what is meant by a band,<ref name="RecordCollector"/> and it also became a major influence on emerging electronic pop artists.<ref name="LAWeekly"/> It spawned two singles in the top-fifteen UK chart: "[[The Number One Song in Heaven]]" and "[[Beat the Clock (song)|Beat The Clock]]".<ref name=chart>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/15022/sparks/ |title=Sparks- UK Charts |publisher=officialcharts.com |access-date=September 19, 2017}}</ref> The follow-up album in 1980, ''[[Terminal Jive]]'', had a hit single in France, "When I'm With You", which led to the Maels' staying in the country for a year promoting the album, during which Russell became conversationally fluent in French.<ref name="RecordCollector"/><ref name="BBC"/> The single also hit the Top 20 in Australia, reaching No.{{nbsp}}14.

Finding the electronic equipment that they had adopted for their new sound too cumbersome for touring, the band returned to the more conventional band format for their next three releases, although they did not eschew synthesizers entirely: ''[[Whomp That Sucker]],'' ''[[Angst in My Pants]],'' (two tracks from which appear later in the 1983 movie ''[[Valley Girl (1983 film)|Valley Girl]]'')<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086525/soundtrack|title=Valley Girl (1983): Soundtracks|publisher=IMDb.com|access-date=18 August 2015}}</ref> and ''[[In Outer Space]]''. They broke into the US singles chart once more, reaching No. 49 with "[[Cool Places]]" from 1983's ''In Outer Space''. The track was a collaboration with [[the Go-Go's]] rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist [[Jane Wiedlin]] (who at one time ran her own Sparks fan club<ref name="Mojo2"/>), and its success was in part thanks to Los Angeles' [[KROQ-FM]] radio station, which hailed them as local heroes.<ref name="LAWeekly"/> In 1984, the Maels wrote and performed several original songs on the soundtrack for the black comedy teen film ''[[Bad Manners (1984 film)|Bad Manners]]'' (aka: ''Growing Pains''), including the film's title song, "Bad Manners".<ref name="Amazon.co.uk">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bad-Manners-DVD-Martin-Mull/dp/B0001E5U4G/|title=Bad Manners – Region 2 DVD|date=16 February 2004|work=Amazon.co.uk}}</ref> In 1989, they scored a hit single in France and in Europe with "Singing in the Shower", sung in duet with [[Rita Mitsouko]]: the single was produced by Tony Visconti.

Beginning in the late 1980s, Sparks attempted to make the Japanese manga ''[[Mai, the Psychic Girl]]'' into a musical, with interest from [[Tim Burton]]<ref name=Gall/> and [[Carolco Pictures]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Carr|first=Jay|title=Batman to battle DeVito's Penguin|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=1991-03-03}}</ref> who purchased the [[film rights]] in August 1991. Carolco hoped Burton would start production in 1992, but he chose to work on ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' and ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'' for [[Touchstone Pictures]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Yang|first=Jeff|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2009/08/06/apop080609.DTL|title=The Pokemon generation grows up|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=2009-08-06|access-date=2010-11-06}}</ref> The option on the film rights eventually expired, and Burton dropped out.<ref name=Gall>{{cite news|last=Galliano|first=Joseph|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/classical/article6895801.ece|title=Striking Sparks with Bergman|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=2009-10-30|access-date=2010-11-06}}</ref> [[Francis Ford Coppola]] later developed the property in the late 1990s.

"The music is all ready and we are hoping that this still might see the light of day."<ref name=Gall/> On May 18, 2010, Burton expressed renewed interest in adapting the property.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/tim-burton-mai-psychic-girl-ross-60405/|title=Tim Burton Directing 'Mai, the Psychic Girl'?|last=Miller|first=Ross|publisher=Screenrant.com|date=2010-05-18|access-date=2014-03-14}}</ref>

===1990s – A new beginning===
In 1993, Ron and Russell returned with the single "National Crime Awareness Week", their first release since the 1988 album ''[[Interior Design (album)|Interior Design]]''. The song was produced by the Scottish [[dance music|dance]] band [[Finitribe]]. In 1994, the Maels released ''[[Gratuitous Sax & Senseless Violins]]'', providing the hit singles "[[When Do I Get to Sing 'My Way']]{{-"}} and "When I Kiss You (I Hear Charlie Parker Playing)". In Germany, "When Do I Get to Sing 'My Way{{'"}} was the No. 1 airplay song for 1994 as well as being hailed critically for its poignant lyrics and touching melody. The band toured in support of the album with percussionist Christi Haydon playing drums. Haydon also appeared in the videos for "[[When Do I Get to Sing 'My Way']]" and "When I Kiss You (I Hear Charlie Parker Playing)", which were both directed by [[Sophie Muller]].

1997 saw the release of ''[[Plagiarism (album)|Plagiarism]]'', an album of cover versions of their own songs featuring collaborations with [[Faith No More]], [[Erasure]] and [[Jimmy Somerville]]. Half of the album was recorded by Tony Visconti in London with the other half recorded by the brothers in their own purpose-built studio in LA, surrounded by busts of [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]].<ref name="LAWeekly"/><ref name="BBC"/> In 1998 they recorded the soundtrack for the action film ''[[Knock Off (film)|Knock Off]]'', starring [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]], directed by the acclaimed Hong Kong-based producer/director [[Tsui Hark]]<ref name="NewYorkPress"/> (who had appeared on his own tribute song by the band on the album ''Gratuitous Sax and Senseless Violins'').

''[[Balls (Sparks album)|Balls]]'', released in 2000, again put the band in a context of electronic instrumentation with some of Ron's most striking and perceptive lyrics. With the release of ''Balls'' the band toured the UK, Germany, Japan and Australia.

===2000s===
After ''Balls'', the band resurfaced in 2002 with the release of an album described as their "genre-defining opus"<ref name="MusicOMH" /> – ''[[Lil' Beethoven]]'', featuring quasi-classical arrangements of strings and choirs.<ref name="BBC"/> ''Lil' Beethoven'' led to renewed interest in the band. ''[[Record Collector]]'' magazine named the album as one of its "Best New Albums of 2002", describing it as "...{{nbsp}}possibly the most exciting and interesting release ever from such a long-established act"<ref name="RecordCollector2">{{cite magazine|title=Best New Albums of 2002|date=January 2003|magazine=Record Collector Magazine Issue|volume=281}}</ref> and later in 2003 saying "...{{nbsp}}it really does feel like one of the best albums ever made."<ref name="RecordCollector"/> A UK and European tour had the band playing the entire album each night in the first half of the show, with fan favourites making up the second. The line-up now included former [[Faith No More]] guitarist [[Dean Menta]] in addition to [[Tammy Glover]] on drums. Long-time fan [[Morrissey]] invited Sparks to perform at the 2004 [[Meltdown (festival)|Meltdown Festival]], of which he was curator. They performed their breakthrough ''Kimono My House'' album, followed by ''Lil Beethoven'', both in their entirety.<ref name="MusicOMH"/> Also in this period, the duo appeared in the music video for [[The Darkness (band)|the Darkness]]' [[Justin Hawkins]]'s cover of "This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us", in which Ron and Russell play the referee and MC at a darts match between Hawkins and darts champion [[Phil Taylor (darts player)|Phil Taylor]]. This version of "This Town" reached No.{{nbsp}}6 in the UK charts. Sparks would later release ''Lil' Beethoven''<nowiki/>'s closing track ''Suburban Homeboy'' as a single.

The song is a multi-section, multi-mood, highly layered track that many felt should have been a UK smash hit had the BBC not misinterpreted the title of the song as being other than it was.

The brothers tend to be dismissive of the latest trends in popular music, seeing most current bands as lacking musical ambition and experimental drive.<ref name="MusicOMH"/><ref name="Billboard"/><ref name="Independent">{{cite web | last= McNair |first= James | title=Sparks: Creating mischief again with their latest album | year= 2006 |work= Enjoyment |url= http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/music/features/article347014.ece/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070124130940/http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/music/features/article347014.ece/|archive-date=2007-01-24 | url-status= dead | access-date=2006-04-18}}</ref> Indeed, the predictable trends in much of modern rock, as they see it, served as inspiration for their latest album.<ref name="Billboard"/> However, they have expressed admiration for [[Eminem]] and [[Morrissey]].<ref name="MusicOMH"/><ref name="Guardian"/>

They released a live DVD of a September 2006 show at The Forum as well as a long-awaited CD release of their previously unavailable 1977 album ''[[Introducing Sparks]]''.

On May 12, 2008, Sparks released the single "Good Morning", taken from the album ''[[Exotic Creatures of the Deep]]''.

May and June 2008 saw the 21-night "[[Exotic Creatures of the Deep#Sparks Spectacular|Sparks Spectacular]]" in London, where they played each of their albums in chronological order during the first twenty nights and premiered their new album on the twenty-first concert on June 13, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=27328_0_2_0_C |title=Sparks to play an album a night in London |publisher=Side-line.com |access-date=2009-06-30}}</ref> Each night, they performed an album in its entirety followed by a rare track{{nbsp}}– many of the songs had never been performed live before. The band asked their fans to visit their website and vote for the track that they'd most like to hear the band perform during the second half of the 21st concert after the premiere of ''Exotic Creatures of the Deep'', though Russell admitted that he and Ron would probably influence the poll a little.

Fans who bought a "Golden Ticket" (which allowed entry into all 21 gigs) also received a poster signed by the band and a CD single entitled "Islington N1", a reference to the postal address of the venue for the first 20 gigs. The song "Islington N1" was later made available in the box set edition of their "New Music For Amnesiacs" career-spanning box set.

In 2009 the band played two consecutive nights at [[The Forum, London|The Forum]] on 20 and 21 March. They played ''Exotic Creatures of the Deep'' in its entirety at both gigs, followed by ''Kimono My House'' in its entirety on the first night and ''No.{{nbsp}}1 in Heaven'' in its entirety on the second night.

Valentine's Day evening 2009 saw Sparks perform the same show featuring their ''Exotic Creatures of the Deep'' and ''Kimono My House'' albums played in their entirety before a sold-out hometown crowd at [[Royce Hall]] at the Mael Bros. alma mater in Los Angeles, UCLA.

Ron and Russell appeared as interview subjects in the 2009 documentary ''The Magnificent Tati'', discussing their involvement during the early 1980s in ''Confusion'', a proposed [[Jacques Tati]] movie for which a screenplay was written but never shot (due to Tati's death).

===''The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman'' (2009)===
{{main|The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman}}
On August 14, 2009, the band premiered the radio musical ''[[The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/gruppsida.aspx?programid=2938&grupp=21081&artikel=3030210|title=Sparks "The Seduction Of Ingmar Bergman" – världspremiär i Radioteatern|date=13 August 2009|access-date=18 August 2015|publisher=[[Sveriges Radio]]|first=Eva|last=Sahlin}}</ref> commissioned by the Swedish public radio (SR) and featuring the Mael brothers themselves and Swedish actors [[Elin Klinga]] and [[Jonas Malmsjö]], both of whom worked with Bergman in his lifetime. The musical, partly in English, partly in Swedish, tells the story of Bergman's relocation to Hollywood after his breakthrough with ''[[Smiles of a Summer Night]]'' (1956), and the surreal and discomforting encounter with the movie capital. On October 28, 2009, the UK's [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] held a similar event in London whereby the musical was played in its entirety before a live audience at the BBC [[Broadcasting House]] in London and later to be broadcast with a Q&A with the Maels. In interviews for Swedish newspapers, the band said they hoped to be able to theatrically stage the musical as well as turn the musical into a feature film. Amongst the filmmakers cited as undertaking ''The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman'' with the Mael Brothers is Canadian avant-garde director [[Guy Maddin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sydsvenskan.se/kultur-och-nojen/article537268/Sparks-later-Bergman-sjunga-ut.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120716062336/http://sydsvenskan.se/kultur-och-nojen/article537268/Sparks-later-Bergman-sjunga-ut.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-16 |title=Sparks låter Bergman sjunga ut – Kultur & Nöjen – Sydsvenskan – Nyheter dygnet runt |publisher=Sydsvenskan.se |date=2009-08-13 |access-date=2011-07-09 }}</ref>

On June 25, 2011, as part of the Los Angeles Film Festival, Sparks presented the World Premiere live performance of ''The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman''. Canadian film director [[Guy Maddin]] provided directions based on the screenplay, with Ron and Russell reprising their recorded roles on stage. The role of [[Ingmar Bergman]] was performed by Finnish movie actor [[Peter Franzén]] and American actress [[Ann Magnuson]] portrayed the role of Greta Garbo. The show was held at the [[John Anson Ford Amphitheatre]] in Hollywood.

Since 2011, the band have been pursuing the idea of turning ''The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman'' into a feature film. Originally envisaged as a live-action film, in 2017, the Mael Brothers announced they were taking a new direction and developing Bergman as an animated feature film with director [[Joseph Wallace (animator)|Joseph Wallace]], who created the music video for their track "Edith Piaf (Said It Better Than Me)".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/features/interviews/sparks-interview |title=Joyous nonsense and sly jokes: Sparks on new album Hippopotamus and upcoming musical film |publisher=thelineofbestfit.com |date=2017-09-16 |access-date=2019-10-03 }}</ref>

===2010s===
In 2010, Sparks remixed [[Yoko Ono]]'s song "[[Give Me Something]]". In July they contributed a remix of sorts to singer [[Katie Melua]]'s single, [[A Happy Place]], calling it ''Sparks VS. Melua.'' September 2 marked the debut of the new theme songs that Ron and Russell have composed and recorded for [[NPR]] radio's Bookworm show, broadcast in Los Angeles on station [[KCRW]]. The two songs mark the first time in 21 years that the Bookworm show has used a new theme song, these being commissioned by show host and Sparks fan [[Michael Silverblatt]]. The compositions were entitled "Where Would We Be Without Books?" and "I Am A Bookworm".

For the encore of what may have been the final live date ever in America for [[Faith No More]] on December 1 at the [[Hollywood Palladium]] in Los Angeles, Ron and Russell Mael were invited by [[Mike Patton]] and Co. to perform the Sparks' classic hit "This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us". They reprised the song that also appears as a collaboration with [[Faith No More]] on Sparks' 1997 album ''Plagiarism'' and had also been released as a single.

In 2012 Ron and Russell collaborated with singer [[Gemma Ray]] who released a limited 12-inch single titled "Gemma Ray Sings Sparks (with Sparks)", which included Ray's covers of Sparks' "How Do I Get To Carnegie Hall" and "Eaten by the Monster of Love".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nAUk87v9No|title=Gemma Ray sings Sparks (with Sparks) - How Do I Get To Carnegie Hall?|publisher=[[Bronze Rat Records]] (via YouTube)|date=3 Feb 2012|access-date=18 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIRVI287UwQ|title=Eaten By the Monster of Love|date=3 December 2014|publisher=Pias UK Limited (via YouTube)}}</ref> Though the songs were covers sung by Ray, they were arranged and produced by the Maels. In October, Ron and Russell performed for the first time ever as a duo, with no band. The 18-city European tour titled "Two Hands One Mouth" began in Lithuania and followed in Latvia, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Germany, Belgium, the UK and Ireland. The final UK concert of the tour was at the sold-out [[Barbican Centre]] in London. The tour then took the group to Japan with concerts in Tokyo and Osaka in January 2013. In April 2013, the show was presented for the first time in the US with two performances at the [[Coachella Festival]]. A short US tour with shows in New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle, and Philadelphia followed. In May 2013 Ron and Russell played the show in Paris, France, which coincided with their visit to the Cannes Film Festival. In Paris, they were joined on stage by [[Catherine Ringer]] from Les Rita Mitsouko to sing on their 1989 collaboration "Singing in The Shower".

Sparks first live album, ''[[Two Hands, One Mouth: Live in Europe]]'' was released in 2013. It contains concert recordings gathered from various cities during the October 2012 European tour. In Fall Ron and Russell continued touring in the duo format for a second round. The tour was titled "The Revenge of Two Hands One Mouth". The two-and-a-half-month tour started with shows in the US and Canada. Sparks played in Los Angeles ([[The Fonda Theatre]]), New York City ([[Webster Hall]]), [[Fun Fun Fun Fest]] in Austin, Mountain Oasis Electronic Summit in Asheville, Atlanta, Boston, Washington D.C. ([[9:30 Club]]), Toronto, Montreal, Chicago, and Pontiac. The tour then continued to Europe, where they played three nights at Union Chapel in London (where [[Thurston Moore]] (ex-[[Sonic Youth]] joined them to play guitar on "This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us" on one of the nights), as well as additional shows in the UK, Switzerland, France, Spain, and Sweden.

Both "Two Hands One Mouth" and "The Revenge of Two Hands One Mouth" tours were critically well received.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/09080-sparks-live-review|title=LIVE REPORT: Sparks|first=Emily|last=Bick|newspaper=[[The Quietus]]|date=17 June 2012|access-date=18 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://spinningplatters.com/2013/04/22/show-review-sparks-two-hands-one-mouth-at-the-chapel-492013/|title=Fauxchella Review: Sparks: "Two Hands, One Mouth" at The Chapel, 9 April 2013|first=Jonathan|last=Pirro|date=22 April 2013|access-date=18 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ravechild.co.uk/2013/12/04/live-review-sparks-at-the-arches-251113/|title=Live review: Sparks at The Arches, 25 November 2013|date=4 December 2013|first=Max|last=Sefton|publisher=Ravechild|access-date=18 August 2015}}</ref>

==Style==
Sparks is generally regarded as an [[art pop]] band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/music-interviews/sparks-interview-russell-mael-adam-driver-steady-drip-2020-2669658|title=Sparks tell us about working with Adam Driver and "coming from a different realm of pop"|website=Nme.com|first=Gary|last=Ryan|date=19 May 2020|access-date=14 September 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thevinylfactory.com/features/beyond-bowie-the-mutating-art-pop-of-sparks-in-10-records/|title=Beyond Bowie: The mutating art-pop of Sparks in 10 records|website=Thevinylfactory.com|date=17 November 2015|access-date=14 September 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.islingtongazette.co.uk/entertainment/music/album-review-sparks-a-steady-drip-drip-drip-1-6722530|title=Album review: Sparks - A Steady Drip, Drip, Drip|first=Stephen|last=Moore|newspaper=[[Islington Gazette]]|access-date=14 September 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/sparks-steady-drip-drip-drip-2645935072.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1?rebelltitem=1|title=Sparks Still Ignite with 'A Steady Drip, Drip, Drip'|date=8 May 2020|website=PopMatters.com|access-date=14 September 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/11/franz-and-sparks-this-town-is-big-enough-for-both-of-us|title=Franz and Sparks: this town is big enough for both of us|date=11 June 2015|website=the Guardian|access-date=14 September 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uncut.co.uk/reviews/album/sparks-a-steady-drip-drip-drip-126795/|title=Sparks – A Steady Drip, Drip, Drip|website=Uncut.co.uk|date=29 May 2020|access-date=14 September 2020}}</ref>
Their musical style has varied dramatically with Russell Mael's distinctive wide-ranging voice (in particular his far-reaching falsetto) and Ron Mael's intricate and rhythmic keyboard playing style being the common thread throughout their fifty-year career. In its review of ''Kimono My House'', ''[[NME]]'' described Russell's [[falsetto]] as a "stratospheric blend of [[Marc Bolan]] and [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]]".<ref>{{cite journal|first=Ian |last=Mac Donald |title=''Kimono My House'' [album review]|journal= [[New Musical Express]]|date= 18 May 1974}}</ref> In the beginning, they attempted to emulate the sound of their English idols, such as [[the Who]], [[Syd Barrett]]-era [[Pink Floyd]] and [[the Kinks]], sometimes even pretending to be an English band while on the LA club circuit. They relocated to England during the [[glam rock]] era where, despite cutting an odd figure on this scene, they found success with their polished brand of intricate pop tunes and convoluted lyrics. Early albums such as ''Kimono My House'' combined glam rock with elements of [[bubblegum pop]] and [[baroque music]]. By the second half of the decade, they were concerned that the sound they had developed while based in England was in danger of becoming stale; they returned to LA, determined to adopt a more "[[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]" sound. This they achieved with producer Rupert Holmes on ''Big Beat'' and (sans Holmes) on ''Introducing Sparks''.

The band were not satisfied with the results, which they felt lacked personality, perhaps because of the reliance on [[session musician]]s. This led to the most dramatic change of style the band would attempt, when they teamed up with [[Giorgio Moroder]], dropped the rock-group format altogether and produced the [[disco]] record ''No.{{nbsp}}1 in Heaven'' which relied on synthesizers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/no-1-in-heaven-mw0000454176|title=No. 1 in Heaven - Sparks - Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards|website=[[AllMusic]]|first=John|last=Bush|access-date=18 August 2015}}</ref> This album is regarded as a landmark in the development of electronic music and greatly influenced bands which would emerge in the following years.<ref name="LAWeekly"/><ref name="RecordCollector"/> They soon returned to a more traditional line-up, which remained until 1988's ''Interior Design''. There then followed a long hiatus until 1994's ''Gratuitous Sax & Senseless Violins'', which was a foray into the [[techno]] dance world, which they had helped to spawn back in the late 1970s.<ref name="MusicCom">{{cite web|title=Sparks Profile on music.com |url=http://www.music.com/group/sparks/1/ |access-date=2006-04-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060128095916/http://www.music.com/group/sparks/1/ |archive-date=2006-01-28 }}</ref>

In 2002, the band switched to a classically influenced [[art pop]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/expect-the-unexpected-a-conversation-with-sparks-2495382062.html|title=Expect the Unexpected: A Conversation with Sparks|date=13 September 2017|access-date=22 November 2017}}</ref> style with the release of their album ''Lil' Beethoven'', replacing the beat-driven [[synth-pop]] of their previous albums with complex orchestral arrangements. The band acknowledged this change in style on the album's opening track "The Rhythm Thief".<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[PopMatters]]|url=https://www.popmatters.com/review/175937-sparks-new-music-for-amnesiacs-the-ultimate-collection/|title=Sparks: New Music for Amnesiacs, the Ultimate Collection|first=Zachary|last=Houle|date=24 October 2013|access-date=18 August 2015}}</ref>

Lyrically, the band's style has been described as coming from "the school of [[Cole Porter]], favouring caustic wit over trivial personal problems,{{nbsp}}... achingly clever lyrics seesaw between superficial gloss, profound sentiment and the incomprehensibly bizarre".<ref name="LAWeekly"/> Repeated lyrical motifs have become a distinct feature on recent albums. On "My Baby's Taking Me Home" of ''Lil' Beethoven'' (2002), the song title is repeated 104 times, with no other words being used, other than a spoken interlude.<ref name="RecordCollector"/> Similarly, on the same album, "Your Call Is Very Important To Us", uses a corporation style call-hold message: "Your call is very important to us.  Please hold" which is then sung with some additional words: "At first she said your call is very important to us, then she said please, please hold." The only other lyrics in the song are "Red light", "Green light", "I'm Getting Mixed Signals" and "Sorry, I'm Going To Have To Put You Back On Hold". These elements are layered with a simple piano line to create a highly textured effect.<ref name="Stylus"/>

The vocal sound on the single "This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us" was criticised as being "stylised". This may be because the song was written without any regard for the vocal style of Russell Mael. Ron Mael has explained:

<blockquote>"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us" was written in A, and by God, it'll be sung in A. I just feel that if you're coming up with most of the music, then you have an idea where it's going to go. And no singer is gonna get in my way.</blockquote>

Russell Mael has claimed in reply:

<blockquote>When he wrote "This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us", Ron could only play it in that key. It was so much work to transpose the song and one of us had to budge, so I made the adjustment to fit in. My voice ain't a "rock" voice. It's not soulful, in the traditional rock way; It's not about "guts". It's untrained, unschooled, I never questioned why I was singing high. It just happened, dictated by the songs. Ron has always written Sparks' lyrics and never transposed them into a rock key for me to sing. He always packed each line with words and I had to sing them as they were.<ref>[[The Word (magazine)|The Word]], No. 36, February 2006.</ref>
</blockquote>

==Legacy==
Sparks has influenced many later genres including [[synth-pop]], [[New wave music|new wave]], [[post-punk]], and [[alternative music]], influencing a wide range of singers and bands including  [[Joy Division]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Depeche Mode]], [[The Smiths]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Sonic Youth]] and [[Björk]].

[[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]] of the [[Sex Pistols]] said that he constantly listened to ''Kimono My House'' back in 1974 at [[Paul Cook]]'s room. "We'd sit in his bedroom for hours listening to them".<ref>{{cite book|author-link=Steve Jones|title=Lonely Boy: Tales from a Sex Pistol|date=2017|publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=978-0306824814|quote=The first [[Be-Bop Deluxe]] album, ''[[Axe Victim]]'', and Sparks' Kimono My House were both big albums for me and Cookie – We'd sit in his bedroom for hours listening to them.

Joy Division's drummer [[Stephen Morris (musician)|Stephen Morris]] stated: "When we were doing 'Love Will Tear Us Apart', there were two records we were into: [[Frank Sinatra]]'s Greatest Hits and Number One Song in Heaven by Sparks. That was the beginning of getting interested in Giorgio Moroder".<ref>{{cite book |author=Reynolds, Simon |title=Totally Wired: Post-Punk Interviews and Overviews |publisher=[[Faber and Faber]] |year=2009 |isbn=978-0571235490}}</ref> [[Peter Hook]] of New Order cited Moroder's production on "The Number One Song in Heaven" as a major influence when his band changed musical style to produce electro/dance-rock songs like "[[Temptation (New Order song)|Temptation]]" in 1982. New Order also delivered an extended live version of "When I'm With You" that same year in Milano.<ref>In his autobiography, Peter Hook relates a New Order concert in Milan in 1982 where they did a cover of the 1979 Sparks track, "When I'm With You".
