'''Randall Hank Williams''' (born May 26, 1949), known professionally as '''Hank Williams Jr.''' or '''Bocephus''', is an American singer-songwriter and musician. His musical style is often considered a blend of [[Southern rock]], [[blues]], and [[country music|country]]. He is the son of country music legend [[Hank Williams]].

Williams began his career following in his famed father's footsteps, covering his father's songs and imitating his father's style. Williams' first [[television]] appearance was in a 1964 episode of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Jimmy Dean|The Jimmy Dean Show]]'', in which at age fourteen he sang several songs associated with his father. Later that year, he was a guest star on ''[[Shindig!]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0929947/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t130|title=Hank Williams, Jr.|publisher=[[IMDb]]|access-date=August 8, 2018}}</ref>

Williams' style evolved slowly as he struggled to find his own voice and place within [[country music]]. This was interrupted by a near-fatal fall off the side of [[List of mountains in Beaverhead County, Montana|Ajax Peak in Montana]] on August 8, 1975.<ref name="People">{{cite journal|last=Buchalter|first=Gail|date=October 22, 1979|title=Hank Williams Jr. Fell Down a Mountain and Lived Now He's Climbing High on the C&w Charts|journal=[[People (magazine)|People]]|volume=12|issue=17|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20074883,00.html|access-date=August 3, 2013}}</ref><ref name="TheFall">{{cite web|url=http://countrymusichalloffame.org/the-fall/|title=The Fall|publisher=[[Country Music Hall of Fame]]|access-date=August 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104074223/http://countrymusichalloffame.org/the-fall/|archive-date=November 4, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> After an extended recovery, he challenged the country music establishment with a blend of country, rock, and blues.

==Early life==
Williams was born Randall Hank Williams on May 26, 1949, in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]]. [[Hank Williams|His father]] nicknamed him Bocephus (after [[Grand Ole Opry]] comedian [[Rod Brasfield]]'s ventriloquist dummy).<ref>{{cite web|url =https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-awkward-enduring-influence-of-hank-williams-jr|title =The Awkward, Enduring Influence of Hank Williams, Jr.|website =The New Yorker|first =David|last =Cantwell|date =March 24, 2016}}</ref> After his father's death in 1953, he was raised by his mother, [[Audrey Williams]].

While he was a child, a <!--really? vast--> number of contemporary musicians visited his family, who influenced and taught him various music instruments and styles. {{citation needed|date=June 2020}} Among these figures of influence were [[Merle Haggard]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Earl Scruggs]], [[Lightnin' Hopkins]], and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]. Williams first stepped on the stage and sang his father's songs when he was eight years old.

He attended John Overton High School in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where he would bring his guitar to music class and play for pep rallies and performances of the choir.

== Career ==
In 1964, Williams made his recording debut with "[[Long Gone Lonesome Blues]]", one of his father's many classic songs.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Billboard Book Of Top 40 Country Hits: 1944–2006, Second edition |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=388 |language=en |isbn=0823082911 }}</ref>

He provided the singing voice of his father<ref name="pc9">{{Pop Chronicles |9 |4|Hank Williams Jr.}}</ref> in the 1964 film ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]].''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058765/ |title=Your Cheatin' Heart |date=December 1, 1964 |website=IMDb.com}}</ref> He also recorded an album of duets with recordings of his father.<ref name="pc9" />

===A change in appearance and musical direction===
Although Williams' recordings earned him numerous country hits throughout the 1960s and early 1970s with his role as a "Hank Williams impersonator", he became disillusioned and severed ties with his mother.{{Why|date=June 2020}}

By the mid-1970s Williams began to pursue a musical direction that would eventually make him a superstar. While recording a series of moderately successful songs, Williams began a heavy pattern of both drug and alcohol abuse. Upon moving to [[Alabama]], in an attempt to refocus both his creative energy and his troubled personal life, Williams began playing music with [[Southern rock]] musicians including [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Toy Caldwell]], and [[Charlie Daniels]]. ''[[Hank Williams Jr. and Friends]]'' (1975), often considered his watershed album, was the product of these then-groundbreaking collaborations.

On August 8, 1975, Williams was nearly killed in a mountain-climbing accident in southwestern [[Montana]]. While<!-- he was--> climbing [[List of mountains in Beaverhead County, Montana|Ajax Peak]] on the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|continental divide]] ([[Idaho]] border) west of [[Jackson, Montana|Jackson]], the snow beneath him collapsed and he fell almost {{convert|500|ft}} onto rock; he suffered multiple skull and facial fractures.<ref name=singfll>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8R9OAAAAIBAJ&pg=1923%2C4536621 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Singer injured in fall |date=August 11, 1975 |page=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-01-11-williams-miner-visit_x.htm?POE=LIFISVA | work=USA Today | title=Hank Williams visits W.Va. mine survivor | date=January 11, 2006}}</ref> The incident was chronicled in the semi-autobiographical, made-for-television film ''[[Living Proof: The Hank Williams Jr. Story]]''. He spent two years in recovery, having several reconstructive surgeries in addition to having to learn to talk and sing again. To hide the scars and the disfigurement from the accident, Williams grew a beard and began wearing sunglasses and a [[cowboy hat]]. The beard, hat, and sunglasses have since become his [[trademark look|signature look]], and he is rarely seen without them.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

In 1977, Williams recorded and released ''One Night Stands'' and ''The New South'', and worked closely with his old friend Waylon Jennings on the song "Once and For All".{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

In 1980, he appeared on the [[PBS]] show ''[[Austin City Limits]]'' during Season 5, along with the Shake Russell-[[Dana Cooper]] Band.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

===Acceptance into the country music establishment===

[[File:HankWilliamsJrCollage-1000.jpg|thumb|upright=1.45|Williams performing at the Chumash Casino Resort in Santa Ynez, California, 2006]]

In 1976, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote that Williams' "mainstream country material has always been among [[Nashville Tennessee|Nashville]]{{'}}s best".<ref>{{Cite web| title = Hank Williams Jr.: Hank William Jr. and Friends. By John Morthland : Articles, reviews and interviews from Rock's Backpages.| access-date = June 25, 2018| url = https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/hank-williams-jr-ihank-william-jr-and-friendsi|via=[[Rock's Backpages]] |url-access=subscription }}</ref> Williams' career began to hit its peak after the Nashville establishment gradually—and somewhat reluctantly—accepted his new sound. His popularity had risen to levels where he could no longer be overlooked for major industry awards.

He was prolific throughout the 1980s, sometimes recording and releasing two albums a year. ''[[Family Tradition (album)|Family Tradition]]'', ''[[Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound (album)|Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound]]'', ''[[Habits Old and New]]'', ''[[Rowdy (Hank Williams, Jr. album)|Rowdy]]'', ''[[The Pressure Is On]]'', ''[[High Notes]]'', ''[[Strong Stuff]]'', ''[[Man of Steel (album)|Man of Steel]]'', ''[[Major Moves (album)|Major Moves]]'', ''[[Five-O (album)|Five-O]]'', ''[[Montana Cafe]]'', and many others resulted in a long string of hits.

Between 1979 and 1992, Williams released 21 albums—18 studio albums and three compilations—that were all certified at least [[Music recording certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. Between 1979 and 1990, he enjoyed a string of 30 Top Ten singles on the Billboard Country charts, including eight No.&nbsp;1 singles, for a total of 44 Top Ten singles, including a total of 10 No.&nbsp;1 singles, during his career.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

In 1982, he had nine albums simultaneously on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, all of which were original works and not compilations. In 1987–88, Williams was named Entertainer of the Year by the [[Country Music Association]]. In 1987, 1988, and 1989, he won the same award from the [[Academy of Country Music]]. The pinnacle album of his acceptance and popularity was ''[[Born to Boogie (album)|Born to Boogie]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

During the 1980s, Williams Jr. became a country music superstar known for catchy anthems and hard-edged, rock-influenced country. During the late 1970s and into the mid-1980s, Williams' songs constantly flew into the number one or number two spots, with songs such as "Family Tradition", "Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound", "Old Habits", "Ain't Misbehavin{{'"}}, "[[Born to Boogie (song)|Born to Boogie]]", and "My Name Is Bocephus".{{Clarify|date=May 2010}}

The hit single "[[Wild Streak]]" (1987) was co-written by [[Houston]] native [[Terri Sharp]], for which Williams and Sharp both earned gold records.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

In 1988, he released a Southern pride song, "[[If the South Woulda Won]]". The reference is to a notional Southern victory in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. 

His 1989 hit "[[There's a Tear in My Beer]]" was a duet with his father created using electronic merging technology. The song was written by his father, and had been previously recorded with Hank Williams playing the guitar as the sole instrument. The music video for the song combined existing television footage of Hank Williams performing, onto which electronic merging technology impressed the recordings of Williams, which then made it appear as if he were actually playing with his father. The video was both a critical and commercial success. It was named ''Video of the Year'' by both the Country Music Association and the Academy of Country Music. Williams would go on to win a [[Grammy Award]] in 1990 for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals|Best Country Vocal Collaboration]].{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

He is well known for his hit "[[A Country Boy Can Survive]]" and as the performer of the theme song for ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', based on his 1984 hit "[[All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight]]". In 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994, Williams' opening themes for ''Monday Night Football'' earned him four [[Emmy Award]]s.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} 
[[File:Hank Williams, Jr. (2006).jpg|thumb|Williams in 2006]]
In 2000, he provided the voice of Injun Joe in ''[[Tom Sawyer (2000 film)|Tom Sawyer]]''. In 2001, Williams Jr. co-wrote his classic hit "A Country Boy Can Survive" after 9/11, renaming it "America Can Survive". In 2004, Williams was featured prominently on ''[[CMT Outlaws]]''. In 2006, he starred at the Summerfest concert.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

He has also made a cameo appearance along with [[Larry the Cable Guy]], [[Kid Rock]], and [[Charlie Daniels]] in [[Gretchen Wilson]]'s music video for the song "[[All Jacked Up (song)|All Jacked Up]]". He and [[Kid Rock]] also appeared in Wilson's "[[Redneck Woman]]" video. Hank also had a small part of Kid Rock's video "Only God Knows Why", and "Redneck Paradise".{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

In April 2009, Williams released a new single, "Red, White & Pink-Slip Blues", which peaked at number 43 on the country charts. The song was the lead-off single to Williams' album ''[[127 Rose Avenue]]''. The album debuted and peaked at number 7 on the ''Billboard'' Top Country Albums chart. Also in July 2009, ''127 Rose Avenue'' was announced as his last album for Curb Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1616664/hank-williams-jr-says-new-album-is-his-last-for-curb-records.jhtml|title=Hank Williams Jr. says new album is his last for Curb Records|last=Morris|first=Edward|work=[[Country Music Television]]|date=July 21, 2009|access-date=July 24, 2009}}</ref>

==Politics==
Williams has been politically involved with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. For the [[2000 U.S. Presidential election]], he rerecorded his song "We Are Young Country" to "This is Bush–Cheney Country". On October 15, 2008, at a rally in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]] for Republican presidential nominee [[John McCain]], he performed "McCain–Palin Tradition", a song in support of McCain and his running mate, [[Sarah Palin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/10/the_mccainpalin_tradition.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206023625/http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/10/the_mccainpalin_tradition.php|url-status=dead|title="McCain–Palin Tradition"|archive-date=February 6, 2009|access-date=November 5, 2020}}</ref> He has contributed to federal election campaigns, mostly to Republicans, including [[Michele Bachmann]]'s 2012 presidential campaign. However, he has donated to some Democrats in the past, most notably [[Jim Cooper]] and [[John S. Tanner]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmeat.com/celebrity_political_donations/Hank_Williams_Jr.php|title=Hank Williams Jr.|publisher=Federal Campaign Contribution Report|access-date=November 27, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054027/http://www.newsmeat.com/celebrity_political_donations/Hank_Williams_Jr.php|archive-date=September 21, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In November 2008, Williams considered a run for the 2012 Republican nomination as a [[U.S. Senator]] from Tennessee for the seat held by GOP incumbent [[Bob Corker]], although his publicist said Williams "no announcement has been made".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://realclearpolitics.blogs.time.com/2008/11/25/hank-williams-jr-for-senate |title=Hank Williams Jr. For Senate? - Real Clear Politics – TIME.com |publisher=Realclearpolitics.blogs.time.com |date=November 25, 2008 |access-date=November 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128170506/http://realclearpolitics.blogs.time.com/2008/11/25/hank-williams-jr-for-senate/|archive-date=January 28, 2012 }}</ref> Williams, ultimately, did not run.

===2011 ''Fox and Friends'' controversy===
In an October 3, 2011, interview with [[Fox News Channel]]'s ''[[Fox & Friends]]'', Williams discussed a June golf game where President [[Barack Obama]] and Republican House Speaker [[John Boehner]] had teamed against Vice President [[Joe Biden]] and Ohio Governor [[John Kasich]], saying the match was "one of the biggest political mistakes ever". When asked why the golf game troubled him, Williams stated, "Come on. That'd be like Hitler playing golf with [[Benjamin Netanyahu|Netanyahu]]&nbsp;... in the shape this country is in?" He also said that the President and Vice President were "the enemy" and compared them to "the [[Three Stooges]]". Later, anchor [[Gretchen Carlson]] said to him, "You used the name of one of the most hated people in all of the world to describe, ''I think'', the president." Williams replied, "Well, that is true. But I'm telling you like it is." As a result of his statements, [[ESPN]] dropped Williams' opening song from its ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' broadcast of the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] versus the [[Indianapolis Colts]] and replaced it with the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]].{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Williams later said his analogy was "extreme – but it was to make a point", and "some of us have strong opinions and are often misunderstood&nbsp;... I was simply trying to explain how stupid it seemed to me – how ludicrous that pairing was. They're polar opposites, and it made no sense. They don't see eye to eye and never will". Additionally, Williams said he has "always respected the office of the president ... Working-class people are hurting – and it doesn't seem like anybody cares. When both sides are high-fiving it on the ninth hole when everybody else is without a job – it makes a whole lot of us angry. Something has to change. The policies have to change". ESPN later said it was "extremely disappointed" in Williams' comments, and pulled his opening from that night's broadcast.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/football/nfl/10/03/espn.williams.ap/index.html |title=ESPN pulls Hank Williams Jr. intro after singer links Obama with Hitler |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=October 3, 2011 |access-date=November 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113134647/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/football/nfl/10/03/espn.williams.ap/index.html |archive-date=November 13, 2011  }}</ref>

Three days later, ESPN announced Williams and his song would not return to ''Monday Night Football'', ending the use of the song that had been part of the broadcast on both ABC and ESPN since 1989.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7066449/espn-hank-williams-jr-theme-song-return-monday-night-football|title=ESPN, Hank Williams Jr. part ways|date=October 6, 2010|work=ESPN.com}}</ref> Williams expressed defiance and indifference on his website, and said he was the one who had made the decision. "After reading hundreds of e-mails, I have made MY decision," he wrote. "By pulling my opening Oct 3rd, You (ESPN) stepped on the Toes of The First Amendment Freedom of Speech, so therefore Me, My Song, and All My Rowdy Friends are OUT OF HERE.
