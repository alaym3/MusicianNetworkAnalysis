'''Robert James Ritchie''' (born January 17, 1971), known professionally as '''Kid Rock''' (also known as '''Bobby Shazam'''),<ref name=DetroitNews/> is an American singer, songwriter and rapper. His style alternates between [[rock music|rock]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[country music|country]], and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. A self-taught musician, he plays every instrument in his backing band and has overseen production on all but two of his albums.<ref name="EveryInstrument">{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kid-rock-motor-citys-bad-boy-does-good/|title=Kid Rock: Motor City's bad boy does good|website=CBSNews.com|access-date=February 1, 2018}}</ref>

Kid Rock started his music career as a rapper and DJ, releasing his debut album ''[[Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast]]'' (1990) on [[Jive Records]]. His subsequent independent releases ''[[The Polyfuze Method]]'' (1993) and ''[[Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp]]'' (1996) saw him developing a more distinctive style, which was fully realized on his breakthrough album ''[[Devil Without a Cause]]'' (1998), which sold 14 million copies. This album and its follow-up, ''[[Cocky (album)|Cocky]]'' (2001), were noted for blending elements of hip hop, country, rock and heavy metal. His most successful single from that period, "[[Cowboy (Kid Rock song)|Cowboy]]" (1999), is considered a pioneering song in the [[country rap]] genre.<ref>{{cite web |title=The White-Rapper Taxonomy |url=https://www.theringer.com/music/2020/10/6/21502594/history-of-white-rappers-eminem-vanilla-ice-mac-miller |first=Justin |last=Sayles |work=The Ringer |date=October 6, 2020}}</ref> His best-selling singles overall are "[[Picture (song)|Picture]]" (2002) and "[[All Summer Long (Kid Rock song)|All Summer Long]]" (2008). Starting with his 2007 album ''[[Rock n Roll Jesus]]'', his musical output has tended to be in the country and rock styles.

==Early life==
Kid Rock was born Robert James Ritchie in [[Romeo, Michigan]], on January 17, 1971, the son of Susan and William Ritchie, who owned multiple car dealerships.<ref name="Biography">{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/kid-rock-251986|title=Kid Rock|website=Biography.com}}</ref><ref name="Allmusic"/><ref name="cowboysindians"/> He was raised in his father's {{convert|5,628|sqft|m2|adj=on}} home on a {{convert|6|acre|ha|abbr=off|adj=on}} property,<ref name="Biography"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/macomb/2016/11/04/kid-rock-macomb-county-house/93299716/|title=Kid Rock's posh childhood home listed in Macomb County for $1.3M|website=Freep.com|access-date=November 3, 2017}}</ref> where he regularly helped his family pick apples and care for their horses.<ref name="The Independent">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/my-secret-life-kid-rock-musician-age-37-870596.html|title=My Secret Life: Kid Rock Musician (age 37)|last=Philby|first=Charlotte |newspaper=[[The Independent]]|access-date=November 30, 2010|location=London|date=July 19, 2008}}</ref> His younger sister, [[Jill Ritchie]], is an actress.<ref name=Heartbreak/> In the 1980s, he became interested in [[hip hop]], began to breakdance, and taught himself how to rap and DJ while performing in talent shows in and around [[Detroit]].<ref name=Biography/><ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist |id=kid-rock-p15074/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Kid Rock – Biography|last=Huey|first=Jeff |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=November 30, 2010}}</ref>

==Career==
===Early career, signing with Jive Records and ''Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast'' (1988–1990)===
Kid Rock began his professional music career as a member of a [[hip hop music]] group called The Beast Crew in the late 1980s.<ref name=Biography/> During this time, he met rapper [[D-Nice]]. That relationship would eventually lead to him becoming the opening act at local shows for [[Boogie Down Productions]].<ref name=Biography/>

During this time, Kid Rock began a professional association with producer [[Mike E. Clark]], who, after some initial skepticism with the idea of a "white" rapper, found himself impressed with Kid Rock's energetic and well-received performance where the artist, using his own turntables and equipment, actually prepared his own beats to demonstrate his skills for Clark.<ref name="freepearly">{{cite web|url=https://www.freep.com/story/entertainment/music/brian-mccollum/2015/08/26/kid-rock-early-years-detroit/31193049/|title=Kid Rock before the fame: The definitive Detroit oral history|website=Freep.com|access-date=February 1, 2018}}</ref>

In 1988, Clark produced a series of demos with Kid Rock and that eventually led to offers from six major record labels, including [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] and [[CBS Associated Records|CBS Records]].<ref name="Allmusic"/><ref name="freepearly"/>

In 1989, Kid Rock became a shareholder in an independent record label that was formed by Alvin Williams and Earl Blunt of EB-Bran Productions, called "Top Dog" Records. Later, that investment would become a 25% ownership stake.<ref name="mtv.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1458341/kid-rocks-ex-partners-ask-judge-to-determine-whos-top-dog/|title=Kid Rock's Ex-Partners Ask Judge To Determine Who's Top Dog|website=MTV.com|access-date=February 1, 2018}}</ref>

With the help of D-Nice, Kid Rock signed with [[Jive Records]] at the age of 17, releasing his debut studio album, ''[[Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast]]'' in 1990.<ref name="Biography"/><ref name="cowboysindians"/><ref name="freepearly"/> According to Kid Rock, the contract with Jive resulted in animosity from fellow rapper [[Vanilla Ice]], who felt that he should have been signed with Jive instead of Kid Rock.<ref name="freepearly"/>

The album made Kid Rock one of the two biggest rap stars in Detroit in 1990, along with local [[independent music|independent]] rapper [[Esham]].<ref name="BehindthePaint164">{{cite book |last1=Bruce |first1=Joseph |author-link=Violent J|last2=Echlin |first2=Hobey |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |date=August 2003 |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/164 164–167] |chapter=Paying Dues }}</ref><ref name="BehindthePaint174">{{cite book |last1=Bruce |first1=Joseph |author-link=Violent J |last2=Echlin |first2=Hobey |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/174 174–189] |chapter=The Dark Carnival|date=August 2003 }}</ref> To promote the album, Kid Rock toured nationally with [[Ice Cube]], D-Nice, [[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]] and [[Too Short]]; Detroit artist [[Champtown]] served as Kid Rock's DJ on this tour.<ref name="freepearly"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www2.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=7099 |title=Archived copy |access-date=January 28, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102071445/http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=7099 |archive-date=January 2, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> During instore promotions for the album, Kid Rock met and developed a friendship with local rapper [[Eminem]], who frequently challenged Kid Rock to rap battles.<ref name="freepearly"/>

Ultimately, unfavorable comparisons to Vanilla Ice led to Jive dropping Kid Rock, according to Mike E. Clark.<ref name="freepearly"/>

===Signing with Continuum Records and ''The Polyfuze Method'' (1992–1995)===
In 1992, Kid Rock signed with local independent record label Continuum.<ref name=freepearly/> Around this time, Kid Rock met local hip hop duo [[Insane Clown Posse]] through Mike E. Clark, who was producing the duo.<ref name="BehindthePaint174" /> While ICP member [[Joseph Bruce|Violent J]] disliked Kid Rock's music, he wanted the rapper to appear on ICP's debut album, ''[[Carnival of Carnage]]'', believing the appearance would gain ICP notice, since Kid Rock was a nationally successful artist.<ref name="BehindthePaint174" /> Noting that local rapper Esham was paid $500 to appear on ICP's album, Violent J claims that Kid Rock demanded $600 to record his guest appearance, alleging that Esham and Kid Rock had a feud over who was the bigger rapper.<ref name="BehindthePaint174" /> Kid Rock showed up to record the song "Is That You?" intoxicated, but re-recorded his vocals and record scratching the following day.<ref name="BehindthePaint174" />

In 1993, Kid Rock recorded his second studio album, ''[[The Polyfuze Method]]'', with producer Mike E. Clark, who worked with Kid Rock to help give the album more of a rock-oriented sound than his debut.<ref name="Allmusic"/>

Kid Rock also began releasing his "Bootleg" cassette series to keep local interest in his music.<ref name=freepearly/>

Later in the year, Kid Rock recorded the EP ''[[Fire It Up (EP)|Fire It Up]]'' at White Room Studios in downtown Detroit, run by brothers Michael and Andrew Nehra, who were forming the rock-soul band [[Robert Bradley's Blackwater Surprise]].<ref name=freepearly/> The EP featured the [[heavy metal music|heavy rock]] song "[[I Am the Bullgod]]" and a cover of [[Hank Williams Jr.]]'s [[country music|country]] song "A Country Boy Can Survive".<ref name=freepearly/>

By 1994, Kid Rock's live performances had mostly been backed by DJs Blackman and [[Uncle Kracker]], but Kid Rock soon began to utilize more and more live instrumentation into his performances, and formed the rock band [[Twisted Brown Trucker]].<ref name="Allmusic"/><ref name=freepearly/>

After breaking up with his girlfriend, Kid Rock moved engineer Bob Ebeling into his apartment.<ref name=freepearly/> During a recording session with Mike E. Clark, the producer discovered that Kid Rock could sing when he recorded a reworked cover of [[Billy Joel]]'s "[[It's Still Rock and Roll to Me]]", entitled "It's Still East Detroit to Me", which Clark claims led him to encourage Kid Rock to sing more.<ref name=freepearly/>

During this time, Kid Rock developed animosity towards other Detroit artists, including Insane Clown Posse; according to Mike E. Clark, who worked with both artists, Kid Rock was frustrated with ICP's local success, as Kid Rock disliked ICP's music, and wanted to become more successful than ICP.<ref name=freepearly/>

Through extensive promoting, including distributing tapes on consignment to local stores and giving away free samplers of his music, Kid Rock developed a following among an audience which DJ Uncle Kracker described as "white kids who dropped [[LSD|acid]] and liked listening to [[gangsta rap]]"; this following included local rapper [[Joe C]], who had been attending Kid Rock concerts as a fan, but upon meeting Kid Rock, was invited to perform on stage as Kid Rock's hype man.<ref name=freepearly/>

===''Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp'' and local breakthrough (1996)===
[[File:Kid Rock (3421137233).jpg|thumb|300px|A display of pyrotechnics during one of Kid Rock's performances. His stage presence helped increase his local following in Detroit in the mid-1990s.]]
Kid Rock's stage presence became honed with the addition of a light show, pyrotechnics, dancers and a light-up backdrop bearing the name "Kid Rock", and 1996 saw the release of his most rock-oriented album to date, ''[[Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp]]''; the album's title came from Bob Eberling, who told a sleepless, alcoholic, drug-using Kid Rock, "Dude, you are the early-morning, stoned pimp."<ref name=freepearly/> According to Kid Rock, who distributed the album himself, ''Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp'' sold 14,000 copies.<ref name=cowboysindians/>

Kid Rock developed his stage persona, performing dressed in 1970s pimp clothing with a real, possibly loaded, gun down the front of his pants.<ref name=freepearly/>

Though Kid Rock became known for frequent partying, and using drugs and alcohol, he was primarily focused on increasing his success and fame, placing himself as a businessman first; the result of this drive led to increased success locally.<ref name=freepearly/>

===Signing with Atlantic Records, ''Devil Without a Cause'' and national success (1997–2000)===
Kid Rock's attorney, Tommy Valentino, increased his stature by helping him get articles written about Kid Rock and Twisted Brown Trucker in major publications, including the [[Beastie Boys]]' ''[[Grand Royal]]'' magazine, but though his management tried to interest local record labels in his music, they told his management team that they were not interested in signing a white rapper, to which Valentino told them, "He's not a white rapper. He's a rock star and everything in between."<ref name=freepearly/>

In 1997, Jason Flom, head of [[Lava Records]], attended one of Kid Rock's performances, and met with Kid Rock, who later gave him a demo containing the songs "Somebody's Gotta Feel This" and "I Got One for Ya", which led to Kid Rock signing with Atlantic Records.<ref name=freepearly/><ref name="Lava Record Deal">{{cite web|title=Interview Andy Karp Vice President of A&R at Lava/Atlantic in New York |publisher=AtlanticRecordsContact.com |url=http://www.atlanticrecordscontact.com/ |access-date=July 22, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705133859/http://www.atlanticrecordscontact.com/ |archive-date=July 5, 2008 }}</ref> As part of his recording deal, Kid Rock received $150,000 from the label.<ref name=cowboysindians/>

By this time Kid Rock had fully developed his stage persona, and musical style and wanted to make a "[[redneck]], shit-kicking [[rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]] rap" album, resulting in his fourth studio album, ''[[Devil Without a Cause]]'', recorded at the White Room in Detroit and mixed at the Mix Room in Los Angeles.<ref name=freepearly/>

Through extensive promoting, including appearances on [[1999 MTV Video Music Awards|1999]] [[MTV]] VMA (including a performance alongside [[Aerosmith]] and [[Run-DMC]]) and performing at [[Woodstock 1999]], ''Devil Without a Cause'' sold 14 million copies, the album's success spurred by Kid Rock's breakthrough hit single "[[Bawitdaba]]".<ref name=Biography/><ref name=cowboysindians>{{cite web|url=http://www.cowboysindians.com/2015/07/kid-rock/|title=Kid Rock - C&I Magazine|date=July 1, 2015}}</ref><ref name=freepearly/>

In 2000, Kid Rock was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for Best New Artist, despite having been active in the music industry for over 10 years.<ref name=Biography/> Kid Rock's success, however, was marked by tragedy, with the death of friend and collaborator Joe C.<ref name=Biography/><ref name=freepearly/>

In May 2000, Kid Rock released the compilation album "The History Of Rock", behind the single "[[American Bad Ass]]". The song sampled [[Metallica]]'s 1991 song "[[Sad but True]]", peaking at No. 20 on the mainstream rock chart. Kid Rock would join Metallica on their [[Summer Sanitarium Tour|2000 Summer Sanitarium Tour]] along with Korn and System Of A Down. Kid Rock and Jonathan Davis filled in on vocals for an injured James Hetfield in Atlanta on July 7, 2000. Kid Rock performed American Bad Ass along with the Metallica classics Sad But True, Nothing Else Matters, Fuel and Enter Sandman along with covers of Turn The Page and Fortunate Son. The History Of Rock was certified double platinum and Kid Rock embarked on 2000s History Of Rock and 2001's American Bad Ass Tour's. American Bad Ass was nominated for the Grammy for [[Best Hard Rock Performance]] in 2001, losing out to [[Rage Against the Machine]]'s "[[Guerrilla Radio]]". His song with Robert Bradley "Higher" was featured in a TV spot for [[Gatorade]].
