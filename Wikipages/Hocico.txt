'''Hocico''' ({{IPA-es|oˈsiko}}) is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[electro-industrial]] duo that was formed in 1993 in Mexico City.

== History ==
'''Hocico''' was officially formed in 1993 by cousins Erik Garcia (aka Erk Aicrag) and Oscar Mayorga (aka Racso Agroyam), with Erik writing lyrics and performing the [[vocals]] and Oscar responsible for the [[Programming (music)|programming]]. They had  experimented with [[electronic music]] since they were teenagers and were influenced by [[Industrial music|industrial]] artists such as [[Skinny Puppy]].<ref name="peek-a-boo-2011">{{cite web |last1=Becu |first1=Didier |title=Hocico: In terms of attitude I think we are a punk band. |url=http://www.peek-a-boo-magazine.be/en/interviews/hocico/ |website=Peek-a-boo Music Magazine |accessdate=13 November 2020 |date=15 May 2011}}</ref> Their interest in the industrial and [[Electronic Body Music|EBM]] genres led them to begin their musical career in 1989 in a group called Niñera Degenerada. In 1992 the two cousins left the band and went on to form Hocico de Perro.<ref name="metropolis">{{cite web |title=Artist: Hocico |url=https://www.metropolis-records.com/artist/hocico |website=Metropolis Records |accessdate=12 November 2020}}</ref>

Soon after they dropped the "de Perro" and continued simply as Hocico. The Spanish word "hocico" translates to '[[snout]]' or 'muzzle' in English, and is used in Mexico as a disrespectful way to describe someone's comments coming out of their mouth. In certain contexts, "callate el hocico" could be interpreted as, essentially, "shut up your fucking mouth or we’ll kick your fucking ass," which the band thought described their musical attitude well.<ref name="darkside-2008">{{cite web |last1=Khorina |first1=Ksenia |title=Hocico: Keep your blood boiling! |url=https://www.darkside.ru/interviews/interview.phtml?id=388&dlang=en |website=Russian Darkside e-Zine |accessdate=12 November 2020 |date=5 June 2008}}</ref>

Between 1993 and 1996 the band produced several cassette demos - ''Misuse, Abuse And Accident'', ''Autoagresión Persistente'', and ''Triste Desprecio''. In 1997 the band released their first full CD, ''Odio Bajo El Alma'',<ref name="mb_odio">{{MusicBrainz release-group|mbid=182b9080-51e1-3a29-b8bb-c792bc801fff|name=Odio Bajo El Alma}}</ref> on the label Opción Sónica with European distribution through [[Out of Line Music|Out Of Line]].<ref name="culture_shock_1_97">{{cite journal |author1=Sage |title=Interview: Hocico |journal=Culture Shock |date=1997 |page=26 |issue=01.97 |url=https://archive.org/details/cultureshocktransmission41997/page/n29/mode/2up |publisher=Genocide Project |issn=1093-1651}}</ref>

The release of ''Odio Bajo El Alma'' was well received in Europe and America but caught the Anglo- and Euro-centric scene by surprise, with many unaware that the band's style of electronic music was happening in Mexico.<ref name="electrowelt-2017">{{cite web |title=Interview with ERK of Hocico & Rabia Sorda |url=https://www.electrowelt.com/interview-erk-rabia-sorda/ |website=Electrowelt OnLine Music Magazine |accessdate=12 November 2020 |date=19 December 2017}}</ref> In fact, before 1997, Hocico along with many other Mexico City based electronic bands had been part of a collective called La Corporación that attempted to support and promote their type of music across Mexico. Other bands involved in La Corporación included [[Cenobita]], [https://www.discogs.com/artist/451818-Ogo Ogo], [https://www.discogs.com/artist/978833-Encef%C3%A1lisis Encefálisis], and [https://www.discogs.com/artist/104395-Deus-Ex-Machina Deus Ex Machina].<ref name="culture_shock_1_97" />

The end of the 1990s saw two more albums released on Out Of Line: the live album ''Los Hijos Del Infierno'',<ref name="mb_los_hijos">{{MusicBrainz release-group|mbid=eee86976-823a-3579-84e3-011234ffae96|name=Los Hijos Del Infierno}}</ref> recorded during the band's 1998 European tour, and ''Sangre Hirviente''.<ref name="mb_sangre">{{MusicBrainz release-group|mbid=487ca5dd-b7ab-3f2a-954b-c7802ab4c618|name=Sangre Hirviente}}</ref> In 2002, the band released the album ''Signos De Aberracion''<ref name="mb_signos">{{MusicBrainz release-group|mbid=55444087-a957-3581-8c8d-e3de5364bc32|name=Signos De Aberracion}}</ref> (translated: ''Signs of Hatred''), the subject matter of which treated on disturbing events within their social scene at the time.<ref name="chain-dlk-2003">{{cite web |last1=Urselli |first1=Marc |title=Interview: Hocico |website=Chain D.L.K. |accessdate=12 November 2020 |url=https://www.chaindlk.com/interviews/Hocico/ |date=14 March 2003}}</ref>

After the release of their 2004 album, ''Wrack And Ruin'',<ref name="mb_wrack">{{MusicBrainz release-group|mbid=67be6da2-ae2b-325b-ae40-dcac17083a47|name=Wrack And Ruin}}</ref> the band took a short hiatus from producing new work. During this interlude, the band took time to finish their first DVD, ''A Través De Mundos Que Arden'', and to help produce other Mexican bands, while Erik also focused on his solo project, Rabia Sorda.<ref name="darkside-2008" /> Erik also relocated during this time to Leipzig, Germany while Oscar remained primarily in Mexico City.<ref name="electrowelt-2017" />

In 2008, Hocico returned with the album ''Memorias Atrás'',<ref name="mb_memorias">{{MusicBrainz release-group|mbid=a5a2078c-9cfa-3ccf-95a1-e802b8da7020|name=Memorias Atrás}}</ref> with the theme of "leaving memories behind." The album was released in three versions, one of which was a box set with 3D cover artwork.<ref name="darkside-2008" />

Since 2008 the band has released an album roughly every two years, interspersed with various live albums, compilations, and singles. 2017's release, ''The Spell of the Spider'', reached #42 on the German national charts.<ref name="german_charts_spell">{{cite web |title=Hocico: The Spell of the Spider |url=https://www.offiziellecharts.de/album-details-336587 |website=Offizielle Deutsche Charts |access-date=27 November 2021}}</ref> 2019's ''Artificial Extinction''<ref name="mb_extinction">{{MusicBrainz release-group|mbid=f29c5604-96cb-4056-971e-4258547aaea1|name=Artificial Extinction}}</ref> deals with the concept of artificial intelligence as a threat to humanity and features artwork by German artist Jochen Schilling.<ref name="sideline-2019">{{cite web |author1=Inferno Sound Diaries |title=‘Click Interview’ with Hocico: ‘The World Is Turning To A Dark Place Due To The Misuse Of Our Technology’ |url=https://www.side-line.com/click-interview-with-hocico-the-world-is-turning-to-a-dark-place-due-to-the-misuse-of-our-technology/ |website=Side-Line |accessdate=13 November 2020 |date=28 September 2019}}</ref> ''Artificial Extinction'' reached #30 on the German national charts.<ref name="german_charts_artificial">{{cite web |title=Hocico: Artificial Extinction |url=https://www.offiziellecharts.de/album-details-388972 |website=Offizielle Deutsche Charts |access-date=27 November 2021}}</ref>

==Style and influences==
Hocico's songs are performed in both [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[English language|English]]. The band prefers to use English in order to reach a greater audience, but also wrote songs in Spanish to connect specifically with their home audience.<ref name="culture_shock_1_97" />

The band is known for producing an aggressive style of electronic music, which they attribute to their experiences growing up and living in Mexico City. In a 2003 interview,<ref name="chain-dlk-2003" /> the band stated:
{{Quote
|text=We deal with a lot of violence. Sometimes you walk in Mexico City you see a lot of it. It’s about where we live and things that happen to us. We’d explode without the music.
}}

Hocico has toured extensively over their career with their live shows projecting the same sort of aggressive energy of their musical style, sometimes to the point of physical injury. Their two-person stage presence has taken more of a visual presence over the years including, at times, the addition of performers such as [[Mariachi|mariachi musicians]] and Aztec-themed dancers.<ref name="altvenger-2015">{{cite web |last1=Buljeta |first1=Marija |title=Interview: Hocico |url=http://www.altvenger.com/hocico/ |website=AltVenger |accessdate=12 November 2020 |date=5 November 2015}}</ref>

The band's musical influences include electronic and industrial bands such as [[Skinny Puppy]], [[Leæther Strip]], [[Pouppée Fabrikk]], [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[Cat Rapes Dog]], and [[Depeche Mode]] as well as punk bands like [[Suicidal Tendencies]] and [[Dead Kennedys]].<ref name="altvenger-2015" /> The band also has an affinity for [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and, although typically billed live with other industrial/EBM acts or similarly curated events, they have played at metal music festivals such as Force Metal Fest 2015 in Guadalajara along with [[Judas Priest]] and [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]].<ref name="peek-a-boo-2015">{{cite web |last1=Tabrit |first1=Britta |title=A violent storm approaches the world - Hocico about the ongoing tour, the new single and their music in space |url=http://www.peek-a-boo-magazine.be/en/interviews/hocico-489/ |website=Peek-a-boo Music Magazine |accessdate=13 November 2020 |date=27 April 2015}}</ref>

==Side projects and collaborations==
Erik has a side project called [[Rabia Sorda]]<ref name="electrowelt-2017" /> while Oscar has one called Dulce Liquido.<ref name="culture_shock_1_97" />

In 2002, Erik contributed vocals to the [[Tristesse de la Lune]] track, ''Eiskalte Liebe''.<ref name="darkside-2008" />

In 2016, Erik contributed music and vocals to the Ost+Front album ''Ultra'' and their "Fiesta De Sexo" Maxi.<ref name="sideline-ost-2017">{{cite web |last1=Van Isacker |first1=Bernard |title=OST+FRONT return with brand new max-single ‘Fiesta de sexo!’ (incl. a Miley Cyrus cover) |url=https://www.side-line.com/ostfront-return-with-brand-new-max-single-fiesta-de-sexo-incl-a-miley-cyrus-cover-listen-to-the-title-track-feat-erk-aicrag-from-hocico-rabia-sorda-fame/ |website=Side-Line |accessdate=18 November 2020 |date=7 March 2017}}</ref>
