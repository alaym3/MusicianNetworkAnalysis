'''OneRepublic''' is an American [[pop rock]] band formed in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]],<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.onerepublic.net/bio/default.aspx |title= Biography |website=OneRepublic}}</ref> in 2002. It consists of lead vocalist and multi-instrumentalist [[Ryan Tedder]], guitarists [[Zach Filkins]] and [[Drew Brown (musician)|Drew Brown]], bassist and cellist [[Brent Kutzle]], drummer [[Eddie Fisher (drummer)|Eddie Fisher]] and keyboardist Brian Willett.

The band achieved its first commercial success on [[Myspace]] as an unsigned act.<ref name= "talking shop" /> In late 2002, after OneRepublic played shows throughout the [[Los Angeles]] area, several record labels approached the band with interest, but the band signed with Velvet Hammer, an imprint of [[Columbia Records]]. They made their first album with producer [[Greg Wells]] during the summer and fall of 2005 at his studio, Rocket Carousel, in Culver City, California. The album was scheduled for release on June 6, 2006, but the group was dropped by Columbia two months before the album was released. The lead single of that album, "[[Apologize (OneRepublic song)|Apologize]]", was released on April 30, 2006, on Myspace and received some recognition there, becoming number one on the Myspace charts.

In 2007, OneRepublic released their debut album, ''[[Dreaming Out Loud]]''. Its lead single, "Apologize", was remixed by [[Timbaland]], becoming a huge international success, reaching number one in sixteen countries and subsequently earning them a [[Grammy Award]] nomination.<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/artists/c33c2065-b1c3-4406-b066-d33a9e2ea71a |publisher=BBC|title= OneRepublic}}</ref> The second single, "[[Stop and Stare]]", mirrored its predecessor's success. The album was later certified [[Music recording sales certification|Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The band's second album, ''[[Waking Up (OneRepublic album)|Waking Up]]'' (2009), produced the singles "[[All the Right Moves (OneRepublic song)|All the Right Moves]]", "[[Secrets (OneRepublic song)|Secrets]]", "[[Marchin On]]", and "[[Good Life (OneRepublic song)|Good Life]]", with the last reaching the top ten of the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100.

OneRepublic's third album, ''[[Native (album)|Native]]'' (2013), became the band's first top ten album on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and highest-charting album to date, charting at number four. The lead single, "[[If I Lose Myself]]", charted within the top ten in several countries, while the album's third single, "[[Counting Stars]]", became the band's most successful single in recent years, obtaining top-five placements in Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, the US, and the UK. This marks their highest charting single in the United Kingdom to date. It also peaked at number 2 on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100, matching their highest peak of "Apologize" in 2007.

On October 7, 2016, OneRepublic released ''[[Oh My My (album)|Oh My My]]'', their fourth studio album, which featured a number of collaborators, including [[Cassius (band)|Cassius]], [[Peter Gabriel]], and [[Santigold]]. Preceded by the singles "[[Wherever I Go (OneRepublic song)|Wherever I Go]]", released on May 13, 2016, and "[[Kids (OneRepublic song)|Kids]]", released on August 12, 2016, it was recognized as a change in their sound from previous albums by critics and by the band. In 2017, the band released the singles "[[No Vacancy (OneRepublic song)|No Vacancy]]", "Truth to Power", "[[Stranger Things (Kygo song)|Stranger Things]]" with [[Kygo]] and "[[Rich Love (song)|Rich Love]]" with [[Seeb (music producers)|Seeb]]. Their fifth studio album, ''[[Human (OneRepublic album)|Human]]'', was released in 2021. The band has sold approximately over 16 million records worldwide.

==History==
===1996: Origins===
The first incarnation of what evolved into ''OneRepublic'' formed in 1996 after [[Ryan Tedder]] and [[Zach Filkins]] befriended each other during their [[twelfth grade|senior]] year at [[Colorado Springs Christian High School]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], [[Colorado]].<ref name="bio">{{cite web| url= http://www.campbell.edu/pdf/life/onerepublic-bio.pdf|title=OneRepublic Waking Up| website=Campbell.edu| publisher=|access-date=June 17, 2015| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160306105105/http://www.campbell.edu/pdf/life/onerepublic-bio.pdf|archive-date=March 6, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> During a drive home, as Filkins and Tedder discussed favorite musicians including [[Fiona Apple]], [[Peter Gabriel]] and [[U2]], they decided to assemble a band. They enlisted a few musical friends and named their rock act ''This Beautiful Mess''—a phrase which first attained cult prominence a year earlier when [[Sixpence None the Richer]] released its award-winning second album, ''[[This Beautiful Mess]]''.<ref name="bio" /> Tedder, Filkins & Co. had a few small gigs at Pikes Perk Coffee & Tea House, attended by friends and family. Senior year ended, and Tedder and Filkins parted ways, each attending different colleges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csindy.com/colorado/one-love/Content?oid=1141204 |title=One Love: Who the Hell is OneRepublic?

===2002–2007: Reformation===
Reuniting in Los Angeles in 2002, Tedder and Filkins formed their second band under the moniker ''Republic''. Tedder, by then an established songwriter and record producer, had convinced Filkins to relocate from [[Chicago]]. Nine months later, the band signed with Columbia Records. After a few lineup changes, the group finally settled with Tedder on vocals, Filkins on lead guitar and backing vocals, [[Eddie Fisher (drummer)|Eddie Fisher]] on drums, [[Brent Kutzle]] on bass and cello, and [[Drew Brown (musician)|Drew Brown]] on guitar. The band's name was changed to ''OneRepublic'' after the record company mentioned that the name ''Republic'' might result in [[trademark infringement|legal action]] from other, similarly named bands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sheknows.com/articles/804245.htm|title=One Republic has 'All I Need'|publisher=SheKnows|first=Joel D.|last=Amos|date=June 9, 2008|access-date=October 8, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414205202/http://www.sheknows.com/articles/804245.htm|archive-date=April 14, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The band worked in the studio for two and a half years and recorded its first full-length album. Two months before the album was due to be released, (with "Sleep" as its debut single), OneRepublic was dropped by Columbia Records. The band was beginning to gain prominence on [[MySpace]]; Tedder said it was the number-one unsigned act on MySpace, and credits the website for keeping the band together.<ref name="talking shop">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7079683.stm|work=BBC News Entertainment|title=Talking Shop: Ryan Tedder|date=November 6, 2007}}</ref> The band caught the attention of a number of labels, including [[Timbaland]]'s [[Mosley Music Group]]. The band soon signed onto the label, becoming the first rock band to do so.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/11/20/calendar/et-onerepublic20|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Rocky road to the top|date=November 20, 2007|first=August|last=Brown}}</ref>

===2007–2011: ''Dreaming Out Loud'' and ''Waking Up''===
OneRepublic's debut album, ''[[Dreaming Out Loud]]'', was released on November 20, 2007, and debuted at number 14 in the US with first week sales of 75,000.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Caulfield|first1=Keith|title=Blake Shelton Set for His Best Sales Week Ever on Billboard 200 Chart|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1554987/blake-shelton-set-for-his-best-sales-week-ever-on-billboard-200-chart|publisher=Billboard|access-date=March 29, 2015}}</ref> Critical reception to the album ranged from negative to mixed.

[[File:Onerepublic.jpg|thumb|OneRepublic performing in Australia in March 2008]]
Their lead single, "[[Apologize (OneRepublic song)|Apologize]]", was released in its original version from ''[[Dreaming Out Loud]]''. Timbaland, who at the time was one of the most highly visible artists/producers, approached the band to be featured on a compilation album he was working on, ''[[Shock Value (Timbaland album)|Shock Value]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-2008-04-08-0804070077-story.html|title=The long, strange saga of OneRepublic's Apologize|access-date=October 16, 2020}}</ref> Timbaland rearranged the song slightly to give it more of an R&B feel adding backing vocals, guitar bass line, a new drum section, and autotune to the lead vocals.  This along with the strong backing of the Timbaland name made it a major hit both in the United States and internationally. It peaked a number one globally, including eight consecutive weeks on the [[Billboard Pop 100|'' Billboard'' Pop 100]] chart, subsequently reaching the top three of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. The song sold five million copies in the United States alone, receiving a five-times Platinum certification from the [[RIAA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dmwmedia.com/news/2008/02/27/onerepublic%2526%2523039%3Bs-%2526quot%3Bapologize%2526quot%3B-hits-3-million-download-sales|title=OneRepublic's "Apologize" Hits 3 Million Download Sales|work=Digital Media Wire|date=February 27, 2008}}</ref> The song was a massive hit internationally, reaching number one in sixteen countries, including Australia, Austria, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, and Sweden.

"[[Feel Again]]" was released as the lead single on August 27, 2012, however after the album being delayed it was re-branded as a "promotional single". The song was released as a part of ''[[Save the Children]]'s Every Beat Matters'' campaign, where a portion of the proceeds from the single's sales would be donated. It peaked at number 36 on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100, additionally marking the top ten positions in Germany and on the US Adult Pop Songs chart. The single was later certified Platinum in the US.

On April 2, 2013, the band embarked on their headlining concert tour ''[[Native Tour]]'' in promotion for the album, beginning in Europe. This ran throughout 2013/14 and saw the band perform shows across Europe, North America, Asia and Australia, and New Zealand. The 2013 North American tour was a co-headlining tour with singer-songwriter [[Sara Bareilles]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/1565690/sara-bareilles-onerepublic-announce-co-headlining-tour|title=Sara Bareilles, OneRepublic Announce Co-Headlining Tour|publisher=Billboard.com|date=June 4, 2013|access-date=July 13, 2013}}</ref> while the 2014 ''[[Native Summer Tour]]'' was a co-headlining tour with [[The Script]] and [[American Authors]].

On April 8, 2014, OneRepublic confirmed via Twitter that their new song, "[[Love Runs Out]]", recorded at Studio Faust Records in Prague, would be released. Tedder said that the band had intended the song to be the first single on ''[[Native (album)|Native]]'', but that he could not think of a chorus for the song, so the song's release was delayed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigtop40.com/gossip/onerepublic-tease-brand-new-single-love-runs-out/|title=Latest Chart News|work=Bigtop40}}</ref> The song was added as the second track on the album's re-release on April 14.<ref>{{cite tweet |user= OneRepublic|number= 455562988724834304 |date= April 13, 2014 |title= Get #LoveRunsOut now on the new edition of NATIVE on @iTunesMusic! http://smarturl.it/native |access-date= December 1, 2014 }}</ref> It was also an internationally successful track, breaking the top 5 in Austria, Germany, Canada, Switzerland, and the UK; and reaching the top 15 on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart.
