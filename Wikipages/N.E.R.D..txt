'''N.E.R.D.''' (stylized as '''N⋆E⋆R⋆D''' and '''N.E.R.D''', a [[backronym]] of '''No-one Ever Really Dies''') is a [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[Rock music|rock]] band, formed in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]], in 1999. [[Pharrell Williams]] and [[Chad Hugo]] were signed by [[Teddy Riley (producer)|Teddy Riley]] to [[Virgin Records]] as a duo, [[The Neptunes]]. After producing songs for several artists throughout the late 1990s, the production duo formed the band with [[Shay Haley]] as a side project of The Neptunes in 1999. N.E.R.D.'s debut album, ''[[In Search of... (N.E.R.D album)|In Search Of...]]'', sold 603,000 copies in the United States and was certified [[Music recording sales certification|Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). It was also awarded the second annual [[Shortlist Music Prize]]. The band's second album, ''[[Fly or Die]]'', sold 412,000 copies in the United States, but shipped at least 500,000 units, certifying it Gold.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=criteria |title=Recording Industry Association of America |website=RIAA |access-date=2012-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=N.E.R.D&format=ALBUM&startYear=1958&endYear=2009&sort=Artist&perPage=25 |title=Recording Industry Association of America |website=RIAA |access-date=2012-03-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019020625/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=N.E.R.D&format=ALBUM&startYear=1958&endYear=2009&sort=Artist&perPage=25 |archive-date=2015-10-19 }}</ref>

In 2005, N.E.R.D. ended their contract with Virgin and disbanded.
