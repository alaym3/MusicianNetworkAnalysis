'''Novembers Doom''' is an American [[death-doom]] band from [[Chicago]], currently signed to [[Prophecy Productions]]. Along with [[Evoken]] and [[Rigor Sardonicous]], Novembers Doom is one of the earliest American death-doom bands still active today.

==History==

===Formation and early history===
Novembers Doom formed in 1989 as the [[Death metal|death]]-[[Thrash metal|thrash]] metal band '''Laceration'''. Gradually, the band began to change their sound towards a heavier, slower style, at which point the name Novembers Doom was adopted as the band members felt it more suited their current direction. By 1991, the band was getting noticed in the metal underground for their dark heavy music on early demos (such as the "Scabs" demo, which was recently re-released as part of the ''Amid Its Hallowed Mirth'' remastered CD released in 2008). 

Exploring and expanding, the band added female backing vocals and continued its thick, eerie brand of metal. An early 7-inch record deal with Regress Records, of Italy, allowed [[Avantgarde Records]] to hear the band. This recording was heavy, combined with moods of darkness and despair. The two songs would lead to the release of the band's full-length debut CD, ''Amid Its Hallowed Mirth'' on Avant Garde and [[Nuclear Blast]] in early 1995. 

Shortly thereafter, the band had a lineup change, which would include Jim Bresnahan of Contagion, Cianide, Kommandant fame and a new two song demo was recorded, ''Her Tears Drop''. A compilation track for Pavement Music soon followed. By 1996, the band found themselves having yet another major lineup overhaul, with vocalist [[Paul Kuhr]] and female vocalist Cathy Jo Hejna eventually being the only two original members left. 

In 1997, the newly revamped and refocused lineup of Novembers Doom released the EP ''For Every Leaf That Falls''. The disc was well received, leading to favorable reviews and response worldwide. This led to the band signing a new deal and releasing their second full-length album ''Of Sculptured Ivy and Stone Flowers'', with Martyr Music Group. This new offering had received rave reviews and much media attention and even received high praise in print from their peers in [[My Dying Bride]] and [[Moonspell]].

In May 2000, Novembers Doom entered the recording studio once again, to record the follow-up to ''Of Sculptured Ivy and Stone Flowers''. The band has recorded ''The Knowing'' with Studio One's Chris Wisco. The CD is an extension of the previous material, only taking steps in new directions to enhance their already original sound.

In July 2000, Novembers Doom officially became a member of Dark Symphonies. Realizing the band's potential, they constructed a deal with Martyr Music Group, to include the band on its roster, releasing ''The Knowing'' to the public.

Now, with their third full-length release receiving praise, and a European licensed release of the CD through Pavement Music, Novembers Doom secured themselves more attention than before.

===''To Welcome the Fade''===
In October 2002, Novembers Doom entered the studio to begin work on their second full-length of new material for Dark Symphonies. The band's fourth full-length album would be entitled ''To Welcome the Fade'', only this time they recruited the talents of the [[Grammy Award|Grammy Award-winning]] [[Record producer|producer]], [[Neil Kernon]].<ref>{{cite web|title=NOVEMBERS DOOM Complete Work On "To Welcome The Fade"|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/novembers-doom-complete-work-on-to-welcome-the-fade/|website=Blabbermouth.net|accessdate=November 23, 2015|date=June 13, 2002}}</ref> Kernon, best known for his work with acts like [[Hall & Oates]], [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]], [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Queensrÿche]], [[Judas Priest]], and more recently [[Nevermore]] and [[Cannibal Corpse]], brought a new power and clarity to the sound of the band. This album was chosen as the ''Number One metal album of 2002'' in [[Metal Maniacs]] magazine by one of its head editors, Novembers Doom was also a featured cover story on their January 2003 issue.

===Signing with The End===
In 2004, a successful tour in North America with [[The Gathering (band)|The Gathering]] eventually led to a signing with [[The End Records]] that summer.<ref name=blabbermouth-sign-with-the-end>{{cite web|title=NOVEMBERS DOOM Sign With THE END RECORDS|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/novembers-doom-sign-with-the-end-records/|website=Blabbermouth.net|accessdate=November 23, 2015|date=June 30, 2004}}</ref> During that tour, a CD sampler was given away at each show, entitled ''Reflecting in Grey Dusk'', which featured songs from each previous release, as well as an early demo version of the song, "In the Absence of Grace". This song was listed on the cover as being included on the upcoming album, "Ascension".<ref>{{cite web|title=Novembers Doom - Reflecting in Grey Dusk|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Novembers_Doom/Reflecting_in_Grey_Dusk/38921#album_tabs_notes|website=Encyclopaedia Metallum|accessdate=November 23, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=NOVEMBERS DOOM: Hard At Work On New Material|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/novembers-doom-hard-at-work-on-new-material/|website=Blabbermouth.net|accessdate=November 23, 2015|date=December 8, 2003}}</ref> However, by the time the new album was recorded, the title of the album was changed to ''[[The Pale Haunt Departure]]''. The album was recorded in the Fall of 2004,<ref name=blabbermouth-sign-with-the-end /> and this time around the band enlisted the help of the very respected producer and artist [[Dan Swanö]] ([[Edge of Sanity]], [[Bloodbath]] and [[Nightingale (band)|Nightingale]]) for the mixing duties, and the mastering went to metal guitarist and producer [[James Murphy (metal guitarist)|James Murphy]] ([[Testament (band)|Testament]], [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]] and [[Disincarnate]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=NOVEMBERS DOOM: New Album To Be Mixed By DAN SWANÖ|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/novembers-doom-new-album-to-be-mixed-by-dan-swan/|website=Blabbermouth.net|accessdate=November 23, 2015|date=August 3, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=NOVEMBERS DOOM: New Album To Feature Guest Appearance By DAN SWANÖ|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/novembers-doom-new-album-to-feature-guest-appearance-by-dan-swan/|website=Blabbermouth.net|accessdate=November 23, 2015|date=November 26, 2004}}</ref> The engineering duties were handled by Chris Wisco at Studio One in Racine, Wisconsin.

In March 2005, ''The Pale Haunt Departure'' was released with a tour supporting it. Novembers Doom continues to forge ahead, meshing diverse musical styles and textures in the pursuit of always creating a new and unique listening experience with each new release, while retaining their heavy sound and dark lyrics. With the incorporation of new guitarist/songwriter Vito Marchese, a more straightforward "death metal" approach was incorporated into the songwriting, while still retaining some of their previous dark doom/death sound on certain songs.

In November 2006, Novembers Doom performed their first full-length overseas tour in Western Europe, touring with the bands [[Agalloch]], [[Saturnus (band)|Saturnus]], and [[Thurisaz (band)|Thurisaz]] in support.<ref>{{cite web|title=NOVEMBERS DOOM Announces European Tour|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/novembers-doom-announces-european-tour/|website=Blabbermouth.net|accessdate=November 23, 2015|date=July 31, 2006}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, in early 2007, they released their next CD, ''[[The Novella Reservoir]]'', which continued further down the musical path the band had embarked upon with the previous CD. This new CD garnered many favorable reviews and attention for the band. They returned to Europe later that year to record their upcoming DVD release, The Novella Vosselaar: Live In Belgium, at the Biebob Club in Vosselaar, Belgium. The DVD is scheduled for release on August 5, 2008. A live CD is also tentatively planned, with no release date set yet.

2008 also saw the re-release of the band's first two CDs, ''[[Amid Its Hallowed Mirth]]'' and ''[[Of Sculptured Ivy and Stone Flowers]]'', on their current label [[The End Records]]. Both CDs featured new artwork, bonus tracks and remastered sound. The End Records are also planning to re-release their third CD, ''[[The Knowing]]'', on November 23, 2010, in honor of the album's 10-year anniversary. This release will feature a newly remixed, remastered alternate version of the album on one disc, and a second disc that features the original, untouched version from 2000.

In June–July 2008, the band returned to Europe for their third road trek, most notably performing at the [[Graspop Metal Meeting]] festival on June 28, 2008, in Belgium.

In 2009, the band released their seventh full-length CD ''[[Into Night's Requiem Infernal]]'', and toured behind it in late 2009 and early 2010, making appearances at several festivals such as Brutal Assault Festival in Czech Republic, and Caos Emergente in Portugal. A music video for the song, "A Eulogy For The Living Lost" was also filmed in late 2009, and was released in early 2010.

Their eighth album, [[Aphotic (album)|''Aphotic'']], was released in early 2011.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Their ninth album, ''Bled White'', was released in 2014. They released their tenth album, [[Hamartia (album)|''Hamartia'']], in April 2017

===Signing with Prophecy Productions===
On November 1, 2018, the band announced on [[Facebook]] they had signed to [[Prophecy Productions]]. They released their eleventh album, ''Nephilim Grove'', one year later on November 1, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.invisibleoranges.com/novembers-doom-releasing-nephilim-grove-stream-two-tracks/|title=Novembers Doom Releasing "Nephilim Grove" (Stream Two Tracks)|website=[[Invisible Oranges]] - The Metal Blog|language=en-US|access-date=November 3, 2019}}</ref>
