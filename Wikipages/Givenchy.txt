==History==
===Formation and first years===
[[File:Givenchy house.png|thumb|right|The House of Givenchy]]
In 1952, Hubert de Givenchy founded his own luxury house and launched a new collection ''Les Séparables'' with some floaty skirts and puffy blouses made from raw cotton.<ref>[http://www.elle.fr/Mode/Les-defiles-de-mode/Marques/Defile/Givenchy/%28marque%29/Givenchy Givenchy] Elle.fr {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

Givenchy achieved critical acclaim with Vogue magazine praising his "wonderful first collection"14. The collection included the ''Bettina Blouse'' a white shirt named in honour of [[Bettina Graziani]], which was then painted in one of [[René Gruau]]'s works.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Beyfus |first1=Drusilla |title=Vogue on Hubert de Givenchy |date=2015 |publisher=ABRAMS |isbn=9781613128213 |pages=160}}</ref>

''[[The New York Times]]'' magazine published an article entitled "A Star Is Born" and l’Album du Figaro also wrote a feature stating that "In one night, Hubert de Givenchy became one of fashion’s most famous children with his first collection."{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Models such as [[Suzy Parker]] and [[Dorian Leigh]] became muses of the house.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shaw |first1=Sophie |title=GIVENCHY MUSES THROUGHOUT HISTORY |url=https://www.crfashionbook.com/fashion/g26802695/givenchy-muses-throughout-history/ |website=CR Fashion Book |publisher=Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.}}</ref>

In terms of innovation, he used 'shirting', a raw cotton similar to pattern paper, to create his chic and casual collections.<ref>[http://www.essortment.com/givenchy-36984.html All about Givenchy] Essortment.com</ref>

In 1954, Hubert de Givenchy presented the first shirt dress (which later evolved in to a sack dress in 1957). He was the first high fashion designer to create a luxury [[ready-to-wear]] clothing line, called "Givenchy Université", which was produced in Paris using machinery imported from the United States.<ref name="styl">[http://www.stylesequel.com/designers/givenchy/key-fashion-moments Key fashion moments] Stylesequel.com</ref> Before he was able to sign for this new collection, Hubert de Givenchy bought all the shares of his fashion house back from Louis Fontaine.

===1950s: Balenciaga and Givenchy===
[[File:Givency, vestito corto e cappello, indossato da audrey hepburn in colazone da tiffany, 1961.jpg|thumb|Givenchy short dress and hat worn by [[Audrey Hepburn]] in 1961 movie ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'']]

In 1957, the House of Balenciaga introduced the sack dress for the first time. In 1958, Cristóbal Balenciaga launched the 'Baby Doll' line, along with the coats line 'Ballon'.

The Givenchy studio moved to number 3, Avenue George V in Paris—opposite Balenciaga’s—in 1959. The same year, Givenchy and Balenciaga announced that their respective collections would be shown to the press one month after their presentation to the buyers, in order to avoid any dictate.

===1969–1970s: expansion===
In 1969, Hubert de Givenchy launched his fashion line for men, "Gentleman Givenchy". The boutique was opened in November on Avenue George V.<ref name="Givenchy"/> Hubert de Givenchy later introduced short dress.

On the advice of [[Cristóbal Balenciaga]], Givenchy developed his licences in the 1970s, in order to protect the Haute Couture collections.<ref>[http://www.bloc.com/article/mode-et-beaute/marques-et-magasins/givenchy-le-couturier-des-stars.html Givenchy, le couturier des stars] Bloc.com, Dominique A.C., 18 December 2007 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> In 1971, he designed a collection of embroidered coats in honour of [[Georges Braque]] and [[Joan Miró]].

During this period, the House of Givenchy diversified its activities to create shoes, jewellery, ties, tableware, upholstery and kimono. Hubert de Givenchy was chosen to design the interior of [[Hilton Hotels & Resorts|Hilton hotels]] around the world, and even a car (the [[Lincoln Continental Mark V#Designer and special editions|Continental Mark V]]).<ref>[http://www.vogue.fr/thevoguelist/givenchy/211 The Vogue list: Givenchy] Vogue.fr</ref>

In 1976, Givenchy Inc. (offices and showrooms) arrived on New York’s [[Fifth Avenue]].

In 1991, a retrospective celebrated at the [[Musée Galliera|Galliera Palace]] the forty years of the fashion house. Hubert de Givenchy left the company in 1995.

In 2001, designer [[Julien Macdonald]] was appointed Artistic Director for the women's lines, which consist of [[haute couture]] and ready-to-wear.

===2005–2017, Riccardo Tisci===
The reins for both collections were passed on to [[Riccardo Tisci]] in 2005 when he was named artistic director of womenswear. Riccardo Tisci has proposed to the House his own style and influences. By changing the house codes, Riccardo Tisci adds some dark and sensual romanticism touch.<ref>[http://madame.lefigaro.fr/style/riccardo-tisci-lesprit-fort-de-givenchy-191211-203802 Riccardo Tsci, l'esprit fort de Givenchy] Madame Figaro</ref> Extending the chromatic palette of the house, flashy colors, such as the baby blue and the red blood, metal, wildlife and floral prints, he designs an uncluttered, structured and graphic silhouette.

=== 2017–2020, Clare Waight Keller ===
The House of Givenchy announced the appointment of [[Clare Waight Keller]] as Artistic Director, effective 2 May 2017.

After successfully running three consecutive combined shows under the assistance of Keller, the brand announced to bring back the menswear collection calendar for the autumn/winter 2019 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/givenchy-standalone-menswear-shows|title=Givenchy Returns To Standalone Menswear Shows|publisher=Vogue|access-date=25 October 2018}}</ref>

On 10 April 2020, Keller announced that she would no longer be the creative director of the house.

Waight Keller was the first woman to lead Givenchy since it was established in 1952. After founder Hubert de Givenchy retired in 1995, the house saw a revolving door of designers: John Galliano, Alexander McQueen and Julien MacDonald. Tisci took over the label in 2005, putting it back on the design map with his daring, Goth-tinged fashions during a stellar 12-year tenure.

Among Waight Keller’s key accomplishments was bringing couture back to the runway; Tisci had opted for static presentations, or sprinkling it into his men’s shows – and establishing Givenchy as the go-to brand for Markle’s dressier occasions, including Royal Ascot. She also continued the brand’s momentum on the red carpet.

The house of Givenchy and Clare Waight Keller announce the end of their collaboration on 10 April 2020.

'''2020–present, Matthew M. Williams'''

On 15 June 2020, the House of Givenchy announced that [[Matthew Williams (designer)|Matthew M. Williams]], the co-founder and lead designer of 1017 ALYX 9SM, would take over as Creative Director. Williams will design both menswear and womenswear.

==Icons and the cinema==

===Audrey Hepburn===
The most famous ambassador for the brand was [[Audrey Hepburn]] in films such as ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'' (for which [[Edith Head]] claimed the [[Academy Award]]), ''[[How to Steal a Million]]'', ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'', and ''[[Charade (1963 film)|Charade]]''.

In 1953, Audrey Hepburn and Hubert de Givenchy met by the intermediary of Gladys de Segonzac in a way to create her costumes for ''Sabrina'' by Billy Wilder. As Gladys de Segonzac had organized the meeting with 'Miss Hepburn', the fashion designer thought that he was going to receive Katharine Hepburn. Dressed in a pink and white gingham privateer, a T-shirt and a gondolier hat, the British actress received some prototypes of the future collection. Audrey Hepburn decided to wear Givenchy clothes on and off the screen, such as in ''Sabrina'' (1954), ''[[Love in the Afternoon (1957 film)|Love in the Afternoon]]'' (1957), ''[[Funny Face]]'' (1957), ''Breakfast at Tiffany's'' (1961), ''Charade'' (1963), ''[[Paris When It Sizzles]]'' (1963), ''How to Steal a Million'' (1965) and ''[[Bloodline (1979 film)|Bloodline]]'' (1979).<ref>[https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/09/04/hubert-de-givenchy-remembers-audrey-hepburn/ Hubert de Givenchy Remembers Audrey Hepburn] The Wall Street Journal, le 4 septembre 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.tendances-de-mode.com/2008/01/28/651-audrey-hepburn Audrey Hepburn] Tendances Modes, 28 janvier 2008</ref>

Beginning as a client, she became the muse of the house for forty years, in many classic films. In 1961, Audrey Hepburn installed the reputation of the house by wearing the famous "[[Black Givenchy dress of Audrey Hepburn|little black dress]]" in ''Breakfast at Tiffany's''.

In 1957 Givenchy created a floral aldehyde fragrance, ''L`Interdit'', for Miss Hepburn’s sole use.
