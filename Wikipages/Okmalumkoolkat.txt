==Indecent assault conviction==
Zwane received a six-month jail (five months suspended) sentence in [[Hobart, Tasmania]] in January 2016 for indecently touching a female colleague in a Hobart hotel room while attending the 2016 [[MONA FOMA]] festival. He returned drunk to the Old Woolstore Hotel in Hobart and was unable to find his room, following which he entered a female artist's hotel room and indecently assaulted her. Zwane's lawyers requested a fine instead of a jail sentence but were knocked back as Zwane was scheduled to leave Australia the next day and the fine could not be enforced once he was overseas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mofo rapper jailed for assault on sleeping fellow artist|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/news/mofo-rapper-jailed-for-assault-on-sleeping-fellow-artist/news-story/5ca49b9307df29e6b72f7b1aff07a317|website=themercury.com.au|publisher=The Mercury|access-date=21 January 2016}}</ref>
