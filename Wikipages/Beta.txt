{{Greek Alphabet|letter=beta}}
{{short description|Second letter of the Greek alphabet}}
'''Beta''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|b|iː|t|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|b|eɪ|t|ə}}; uppercase {{Script|Grek|Β}}, lowercase {{Script|Grek|β}}, or [[cursive Greek|cursive]] {{Script|Grek|[[#Typography|ϐ]]}}; {{lang-grc|βῆτα|bē̂ta}} or {{lang-ell|βήτα|víta}}) is the second letter of the [[Greek alphabet]]. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 2. In [[Ancient Greek]], beta represented the [[voiced bilabial plosive]] {{IPA|/b/}}. In [[Modern Greek]], it represents the [[voiced labiodental fricative]] {{IPA|/v/}} (while {{IPA|/b/}} in foreign words is instead commonly transcribed as μπ). Letters that arose from beta include the Roman letter {{angle bracket|[[B]]}} and the Cyrillic letters {{angle bracket|[[Be (Cyrillic)|Б]]}} and {{angle bracket|[[Ve (Cyrillic)|В]]}}.

==Name==
Like the names of most other Greek letters, the name of beta was adopted from the [[acrophony|acrophonic]] name of the corresponding letter in Phoenician, which was the common [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] word ''*bait'' ('house'). In Greek, the name was {{lang|grc|βῆτα}} ''bêta'', pronounced {{IPA-el|bɛ̂ːta|}} in Ancient Greek. It is spelled βήτα in modern monotonic orthography and pronounced {{IPA-el|ˈvita|}}.

==History==
{{see also|Archaic Greek alphabets}}
The letter beta was derived from the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician letter]] [[Bet (letter)|beth]] [[Image:Phoenician beth.svg|20px|Beth]].

The letter Β had the largest number of highly divergent local forms. Besides the standard form (either rounded or pointed, {{GrGl|Beta 16}}), there were forms as varied as {{GrGl|Beta 12}} ([[Gortyn]]), {{GrGl|Beta 01}} and {{GrGl|Beta 10}} ([[Thera]]), {{GrGl|Beta 03}} ([[Argos, Peloponnese|Argos]]), {{GrGl|Beta 05}} ([[Melos]]), {{GrGl|Beta Corinth 1}} ([[Corinth]]), {{GrGl|Beta Byzantium 1}} ([[Megara]], [[Byzantium]]), and {{GrGl|Gamma C-shaped}} ([[Cyclades]]).{{sfn|Jeffery|1961|p=23}}

===Algebraic numerals===
In the system of [[Greek numerals]], beta has a value of 2. Such use is denoted by a number mark: Β′.

===Finance===
[[Beta (finance)|Beta is used in finance]] as a measure of (historical; pseudo-implied) financial asset '''sensitivity to the relevant benchmark index'''. Conditional on the benchmark index, the resulting '''beta value can vary considerably''' (S&P500 vs NASDAQ vs ETF of a specific industry). 

Beta '''should not to be confused with standard deviation''' (or the semi-variance, which considers only negative returns): the preferred measure of the "riskiness" (historical volatility of returns) of an financial asset or a portfolio in isolation. 

Beta can be calculated as the covariance of an financial asset (or portfolio) with its benchmark index, divided by the variance of the benchmark index. 
Since the industry of finance gravitates towards return generating activities, typically the historical returns (percentage changes) are used in the calculations Beta values (among others).
There are numerous other methods an financial analyst can employ to derive Beta values if historical prices are not available.
Beta values change over time (company restructuring; industry sentiment; endo/exogenous factors).  Beta values also vary, conditional on the time period used in calculating a Beta value. 
Beta values can be negative, which infers the existence of financial assets which historically, tended to move in opposite directions to one another by some unit value.  
It would seem these are the optimal "hedges" to offset market-draw-downs, during periods of market-stress and poor liquidity Beta values can vary dramatically, and previously low or even negative correlations converge to "1".  

A beta of 1.5 implies that for every 1% change in the value of the benchmark index, the portfolio's value tends to change by 1.5%.
The greater the absolute value, the greater the implied move.

===International Phonetic Alphabet===
In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], Greek minuscule beta denotes a [[voiced bilabial fricative]] {{ipa|[β]}}.

A superscript version may also indicate a [[compressed vowel]], like {{IPA|[ɯᵝ]}}.

===Meteorology===
Beta has twice been used to [[Tropical cyclone naming|name]] an Atlantic Basin [[tropical cyclone]]:
* [[Hurricane Beta]], in [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005]]
* [[Tropical Storm Beta (2020)|Tropical Storm Beta]], in [[2020 Atlantic hurricane season|2020]]

===Mathematics and science===
Beta is often used to denote a variable in mathematics and physics, where it often has specific meanings for certain applications. In physics a stream of unbound energetic electrons is commonly referred to as [[beta radiation]] or [[beta rays]]. Decays producing electrons or their antiparticles are called [[beta decay]]s. In [[regression analysis]], {{angle bracket|B}} symbolizes nonstandardized partial slope coefficients, whereas {{angle bracket|β}} represents [[Standardized coefficient|standardized (standard deviation-score form) coefficients]]; in both cases, the coefficients reflect the change in the criterion Y per one-unit change in the value of the associated predictor X. β is also used in biology, for instance in [[Beta-Carotene|β-Carotene]], a primary source of [[provitamin]] [[Vitamin A|A]], or the [[Β Cells|β cells]] in [[pancreatic islets]], which produce [[insulin]].

β is sometimes used as a placeholder for an [[ordinal number]] if α is already used. For example, the two roots of a [[quadratic equation]] are typically labelled {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''β''}}.

In spaceflight, [[beta angle]] describes the angle between the orbit plane of a spacecraft or other body and the vector from the sun.

β is sometimes used to mean the [[proton-to-electron mass ratio]].

===Rock climbing terminology===
The term "[[Beta (climbing)|beta]]" refers to advice on how to successfully complete a particular climbing route, boulder problem, or crux sequence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rockandice.com/how-to-climb/climbing-terminology/|title=Rock & Ice – Climbing Terminology|last=Rock and Ice|date=3 October 2016}}</ref>
 
=== Slang ===
{{main|Beta male (slang)}}

''Beta male'', or simply ''beta'', is a slang term for men derived from the designation for beta animals in ethology, along with its counterpart, ''[[Alpha male (slang)|alpha male.]]'' The term has been used as a pejorative self-identifier among members of [[manosphere]] communities, particularly [[incel]]s, who do not believe they are assertive or traditionally [[masculine]], and feel overlooked by women. It is also used to negatively describe other men who are not assertive, particularly in [[heterosexual]] relationships.

=== Statistics ===
In statistics, beta may represent [[type II error]], or [[regression analysis|regression]] slope.

===Typography===
In some high-quality typesetting, especially in the French tradition, a typographic variant of the lowercase letter without a [[descender]] is used within a word for [[ancient Greek]]: {{lang|el|βίβλος}} is printed {{lang|el|βίϐλος}}.<ref name="haralambous">{{cite web|last=Haralambous|first=Yannis|title=From Unicode to typography, a case study: the Greek script|url=http://omega.enstb.org/yannis/pdf/boston99.pdf|year=1999|page=7|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615031345/http://omega.enstb.org/yannis/pdf/boston99.pdf|archive-date=2011-06-15}}</ref>

In typesetting technical literature, it is a commonly made mistake to use the [[ß|German letter ß]] (a s–z or s–s ligature) as a replacement for β. The two letters resemble each other in some fonts, but they are unrelated.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Aguilar Ruiz|first1=Manuel José|title="Las normas ortográficas y ortotipográficas de la nueva Ortografía de la lengua española (2010) aplicadas a las publicaciones biomédicas en español: una visión de conjunto|journal=Panace@|date=2013|volume=14|issue=37|page=104|url=http://www.medtrad.org/panacea/IndiceGeneral/n37-tribuna-MJAguilarRuiz.pdf}}</ref>

===Videotape formats===
"Beta" can be used to refer to several consumer and professional videotape formats developed by Japan's [[Sony|Sony Corporation]]. Although similarly named, they are very different in function and obsolescence.
* [[Betamax]] was the name of a domestic videotape format developed in the 1970s and 1980s. It competed with the Video Home System ([[VHS]]) format developed by the [[JVC|Japanese Victor Company]], to which it eventually succumbed. The Betamax format was also marketed [[Betacord]] by (Sanyo); some cassettes were simply labeled "Beta", and the logo was a lower-case beta. Betamax lost in the market and is an oft-used example of a technically superior solution that failed due to market forces.
* [[Betacam]], including Beta SP and DigiBeta, is a family of professional videotape formats launched in 1982 that was the de facto standard for professional video, advertising, and television production through the 2000s. The formats outlasted analog [[NTSC]] television, and their scarcity today is because the industry has moved to [[High-definition video|HD]] formats.
