== History ==
Asa Taccone met Matthew Compton after renting a room, previously inhabited by [[Danger Mouse (musician)|Brian "Danger Mouse" Burton]], in a large house of mostly musician tenants.<ref name=gotch>Gotch, Kristin (May 7, 2012), [https://www.popmatters.com/feature/158207-troublemen-an-interview-with-electric-guest/ "An Interview with Electric Guest"]. PopMatters. Retrieved February 23, 2016.</ref> Compton was a session drummer, and the two artists began to collaborate.<ref name=shedden /> Burton heard demos of their work and, over the span of a year, urged Taccone to make an album.<ref name=shedden />

Taccone recalled an older woman once calling him "an electric guest of the universe", and used the quote as an inspiration for their band name.<ref name=gotch />

They performed their single "[[This Head I Hold]]" on an April 2012 taping of the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' and have made other television appearances on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' and ''[[Conan (talk show)|''Conan'']]'' in the United States. In the UK, they have done studio performances for [[Lauren Laverne]], [[Dermot O'Leary]], and [[Rob da Bank]] on BBC sessions. While they have performed live on television they have also had their music featured in popular US television shows such as ''[[Teen Wolf (2011 TV series)|Teen Wolf]]'', HBO's award-winning ''[[Girls (TV series)|Girls]]'' and ''[[Suits (American TV series)|Suits]]''.

Electric Guest debuted their album ''[[Mondo (album)|Mondo]]'' in April 2012. The album is very much influenced on retro grooves from the 1970s and 1980s. As reviewed by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, the sound of ''Mondo'' is a “Beck-ian journey into L.A. slacker soul, full of hooky neon jams that ponder fame's fraught highway and the emptiness of modern life.”<ref name=hermes>{{cite web|last=Hermes|first=Will|date=May 7, 2012|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/mondo-20120507|title=Electric Guest Mondo Album Review|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]]|access-date=December 21, 2014}}</ref>

Burton co-produced Electric Guest's debut album ''Mondo'' after a year of exchanging advice and music with Asa Taccone, who happened to be a [[Jorma Taccone|friend's]] younger brother.<ref name=tittiger>Tittiger, Annie (October 29, 2012), [http://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/7-questions-asa-taccone "7 Questions for Asa Taccone"]. ''Mondern Luxury''. Retrieved February 22, 2016.</ref> Taccone then moved to Los Angeles by taking the room Burton was moving out of. Their relationship continued, and ultimately blossomed into their collaboration on ''Mondo''.<ref>''Rolling Stone'' staff (April 11, 2012), [https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/danger-mouse-reveals-why-he-produced-electric-guests-debut-album-20120411#ixzz40vh9cZdM "Danger Mouse Reveals Why He Produced Electric Guest's Debut Album"]. ''Rolling Stone''.Retrieved February 22, 2016.</ref> Besides the album and singles, there has also been a popular cover of [[Little Dragon]]'s 'Ritual Union' which was done for the "Like a Version" sessions for Triple J in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|title=Electric Guest – Ritual Union|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnZhmVuEvo0|access-date=September 29, 2017|date=August 12, 2012}}</ref> Nu:Logic also did a remix of "This Head I Hold" on UFK Drum&Bass.<ref>{{cite web|title=Electric Guest – This Head I Hold (Nu:Logic Remix)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYFerFxRcvM|access-date=September 29, 2017|date=April 12, 2013}}</ref>

Both men have been influenced by distinct genres. Compton has noted ''[[Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons]]'' and ''[[Vu de l'extérieur]]'' as favorites,{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} and said he grew up mostly listening to indie artists.<ref name=gotch /> Taccone grew up on hip/hop and soul,<ref name=gotch /> citing [[Souls Of Mischief]]'s ''[[93 'til Infinity]]'' album, [[E-40]], and [[Mac Dre]] as influences.<ref name=kauffman>Kauffman, Alexia (May 3, 2012), [http://www.welovedc.com/2012/05/03/qa-with-electric-guest/ "Q&A with Electric Guest"]. ''We Love DC''. Retrieved February 22, 2016.</ref>  The band is notable for its pop sound that features [[Motown]] sensibilities with Taccone's falsettos.<ref name=gotch />

Matthew Compton has also appeared on other artist's records, including playing drums on the track 'Wes Come Back' from Rodes Rollins' debut EP Young Adult (2017) and 'Mystery Man' (2018).
