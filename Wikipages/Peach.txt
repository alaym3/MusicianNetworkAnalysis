The '''peach''' (''Prunus persica'') is a [[deciduous]] [[tree]] [[native plant|native]] to the region of [[Northwest China]] between the [[Tarim Basin]] and the north slopes of the [[Kunlun Mountains]], where it was first domesticated and cultivated.<ref>{{Cite book |last1= Faust |first1= M. |last2= Timon |first2= B. L. |doi= 10.1002/9780470650585.ch10 |chapter= Origin and Dissemination of Peach |title= Horticultural Reviews |page=331 |year= 2010 |isbn= 978-0-470-65058-5}}</ref> It bears edible juicy [[fruit]]s with various characteristics, most called '''peaches''' and others (the glossy-skinned, non-fuzzy varieties), '''nectarines'''.

The specific name ''persica'' refers to its widespread cultivation in [[Persia]] (modern-day Iran), from where it was transplanted to Europe. It belongs to the [[genus]] ''Prunus'', which includes the [[cherry]], [[apricot]], [[almond]], and [[plum]], in the [[Rosaceae|rose family]]. The peach is classified with the almond in the subgenus ''Amygdalus'', distinguished from the other subgenera by the corrugated seed shell. Due to their close relatedness, the kernel of a peach stone tastes remarkably similar to almond, and peach stones are often used to make a cheap version of [[marzipan]], known as [[persipan]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Haase|first1=Ilka|last2=Brüning|first2=Philipp|last3=Matissek|first3=Reinhard|last4=Fischer|first4=Markus|date=2013-04-10|title=Real-time PCR assays for the quantitation of rDNA from apricot and other plant species in marzipan|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|volume=61|issue=14|pages=3414–3418|doi=10.1021/jf3052175|issn=1520-5118|pmid=23495652}}</ref>

Peaches and [[Peach#Nectarines|nectarines]] are the same species, though they are regarded commercially as different fruits. The skin of nectarines lacks the fuzz (fruit-skin [[trichome]]s) that peach skin has; a mutation in a single [[gene]] (''MYB25'') is thought to be responsible for the difference between the two.<ref name=osu>{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://food.oregonstate.edu/faq/uffva/nectarine2.html |publisher=Oregon State University |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080714065820/http://food.oregonstate.edu/faq/uffva/nectarine2.html |archive-date=14 July 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Vendramin|first1=Elisa|last2=Pea|first2=Giorgio|last3=Dondini|first3=Luca|last4=Pacheco|first4=Igor|last5=Dettori|first5=Maria Teresa|last6=Gazza|first6=Laura|last7=Scalabrin|first7=Simone|last8=Strozzi|first8=Francesco|last9=Tartarini|first9=Stefano|date=2014-03-03|title=A Unique Mutation in a MYB Gene Cosegregates with the Nectarine Phenotype in Peach|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=9|issue=3|pages=e90574|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0090574|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3940905|pmid=24595269|bibcode=2014PLoSO...990574V|doi-access=free}}</ref>

[[File:Amygdalus persica2.jpg|thumb|left|Peach flowers]]

''Prunus persica'' grows up to {{convert|7|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall and wide, but when pruned properly, trees are usually {{convert|3|–|4|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall and wide.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Average Width of a Peach Tree |url=https://homeguides.sfgate.com/average-width-peach-tree-66469.html |website=SFGate |publisher=Hearst Communications Inc. |access-date=2018-10-23}}</ref> The [[leaf|leaves]] are [[lanceolate]], {{convert|7|–|16|cm|in|frac=2|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|2|–|3|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} broad, and [[pinnate]]ly veined. The [[flower]]s are produced in early spring before the leaves; they are solitary or paired, 2.5–3&nbsp;cm diameter, pink, with five petals. The [[fruit]] has yellow or whitish flesh, a delicate aroma, and a skin that is either velvety (peaches) or smooth (nectarines) in different [[cultivar]]s. The flesh is very delicate and easily bruised in some cultivars, but is fairly firm in some commercial varieties, especially when green. The single, large seed is red-brown, oval shaped, around 1.3–2&nbsp;cm long, and surrounded by a wood-like husk. Peaches, along with cherries, plums, and apricots, are stone fruits ([[drupe]]s). The various [[heirloom varieties]] including the 'Indian Peach', or 'Indian Blood Peach', which ripens in the latter part of the summer, and can have color ranging from red and white, to purple.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.specialtyproduce.com/produce/Indian_Peaches_632.php |title=Indian Peaches Information, Recipes and Facts |publisher=Specialtyproduce.com |access-date=24 September 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920081643/http://www.specialtyproduce.com/produce/Indian_Peaches_632.php |archive-date=20 September 2012 }}</ref>

Cultivated peaches are divided into [[Drupe#Terminology|clingstones and freestones]], depending on whether the flesh sticks to the [[Pyrena|stone]] or not; both can have either white or yellow flesh. Peaches with white flesh typically are very sweet with little [[acid]]ity, while yellow-fleshed peaches typically have an acidic tang coupled with sweetness, though this also varies greatly. Both colors often have some red on their skins. Low-acid, white-fleshed peaches are the most popular kinds in China, Japan, and neighbouring Asian countries, while Europeans and North Americans have historically favoured the acidic, yellow-fleshed [[cultivars]].

== Etymology ==
The scientific name ''persica'', along with the word "peach" itself and its cognates in many European languages, derives from an early European belief that peaches were native to [[Persia]] (modern-day Iran). The [[Ancient Romans]] referred to the peach as ''malum persicum'' "Persian apple", later becoming French ''pêche'', whence the English "peach".<ref>Campbell, Lyle (2004) ''Historical Linguistics: An Introduction'', 2nd ed., Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, p. 274. {{ISBN|0-262-53267-0}}.</ref> The scientific name, ''Prunus persica'', literally means "Persian plum", as it is closely related to the plum.

== Fossil record ==
Fossil [[endocarp]]s with characteristics indistinguishable from those of modern peaches have been recovered from late [[Pliocene]] deposits in [[Kunming]], dating to 2.6 million years ago. In the absence of evidence that the plants were in other ways identical to the modern peach, the name ''Prunus kunmingensis'' has been assigned to these fossils.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=5|title=Peaches Preceded Humans: Fossil Evidence from SW China|author=Su, T.|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|year=2016|doi=10.1038/srep16794|page=16794|display-authors=etal|pmid=26610240|pmc=4660870|bibcode=2015NatSR...516794S}}</ref>

A domesticated peach appeared very early in [[Japan]], in 4700–4400 BC, during the [[Jōmon period]]. It was already similar to modern cultivated forms, where the peach stones are significantly larger and more compressed than earlier stones. This domesticated type of peach was brought into Japan from China. Nevertheless, in China itself, this variety is currently attested only at a later date around 3300 to 2300 BC.<ref name="YangZheng2014" />

In India, the peach first appeared by about 1700 BC, during the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Harappan period]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Fuller, D |author2=Madella, M |year=2001 |chapter=Issues in Harappan Archaeobotany: Retrospect and Prospect |editor1=Settar, S |editor2=Korisettar, R |title=Indian Archaeology in Retrospect |volume=Volume II.

In April 2010, an international consortium, the International Peach Genome Initiative, which include researchers from the United States, Italy, Chile, Spain, and France, announced they had [[Sequencing|sequenced]] the peach tree genome (doubled haploid Lovell). Recently, it published the peach genome sequence and related analyses. The sequence is composed of 227 million nucleotides arranged in eight pseudomolecules representing the eight peach chromosomes (2n = 16). In addition, 27,852 protein-coding genes and 28,689 protein-coding transcripts were predicted.

Particular emphasis in this study is reserved for the analysis of the genetic diversity in peach germplasm and how it was shaped by human activities such as domestication and breeding. Major historical bottlenecks were found, one related to the putative original domestication that is supposed to have taken place in China about 4,000–5,000 years ago, the second is related to the western germplasm and is due to the early dissemination of the peach in Europe from China and the more recent breeding activities in the United States and Europe. These bottlenecks highlighted the substantial reduction of genetic diversity associated with domestication and breeding activities.<ref>{{Cite journal |display-authors=4 |first1=I. |last1=Verde |first2=A.G. |last2=Abbott |first3=S. |last3=Scalabrin |first4=S. |last4=Jung |first5=S. |last5=Shu |first6=F. |last6=Marroni |first7=T. |last7=Zhebentyayeva |first8=M.T. |last8=Dettori |first9=J. |last9=Grimwood |first10=F. |last10=Cattonaro |first11=A. |last11=Zuccolo |first12=L. |last12=Rossini |first13=J. |last13=Jenkins |first14=E. |last14=Vendramin |first15=L.A. |last15=Meisel |first16=V. |last16=Decroocq |first17=B. |last17=Sosinski |first18=S. |last18=Prochnik |first19=T. |last19=Mitros |first20=A. |last20=Policriti |first21=G. |last21=Cipriani | first22=L. |last22=Dondini |first23=S. |last23=Ficklin |first24=D.M. |last24=Goodstein |first25=P. |last25=Xuan |first26=C. |last26=Del Fabbro |first27=V. |last27=Aramini |first28=D. |last28=Copetti |first29=S. |last29=Gonzalez |first30=D.S. |last30=Horner <!--Rachele Falchi, Susan Lucas, Erica Mica, Jonathan Maldonado, Barbara Lazzari, Douglas Bielenberg, Raul Pirona, Mara Miculan, Abdelali Barakat, Raffaele Testolin, Alessandra Stella, Stefano Tartarini, Pietro Tonutti, Pere Arús, Ariel Orellana, Christina Wells, Dorrie Main, Giannina Vizzotto, Herman Silva, Francesco Salamini, Jeremy Schmutz, Michele Morgante & Daniel S Rokhsar-->|title=The high-quality draft genome of peach (''Prunus persica'') identifies unique patterns of genetic diversity, domestication and genome evolution |doi=10.1038/ng.2586 |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=45 |issue=5 |pages=487–494 |year=2013 |pmid=23525075|hdl=2434/218547 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

== Cultivation ==
[[File:Bee pollinating peach flower.jpg|thumb|A peach flower with a [[bee]] pollinating it]]

Peaches grow in a fairly limited range in dry, continental or temperate climates, since the trees have a [[chilling requirement]] that tropical or subtropical areas generally do not satisfy except at high altitudes (for example in certain areas of [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], [[Ethiopia]], [[India]], and [[Nepal]]). Most cultivars require 500 hours of chilling around {{convert|0|to|10|C|F}}. During the chilling period, key chemical reactions occur, but the plant appears dormant. Once the chilling period is fulfilled, the plant enters a second type of dormancy, the quiescence period. During quiescence, buds break and grow when sufficient warm weather favorable to growth is accumulated.<ref>{{cite web |title=Peach tree physiology |publisher=University of Georgia |year=2007 |url=http://www.ent.uga.edu/peach/peachhbk/pdf/physiology.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610090104/http://www.ent.uga.edu/peach/peachhbk/pdf/physiology.pdf |archive-date=10 June 2010}}</ref>

The trees themselves can usually tolerate temperatures to around {{convert|-26|to|-30|C|F}}, although the following season's flower buds are usually killed at these temperatures, preventing a crop that summer. Flower bud death begins to occur between {{convert|-15|and|-25|C|F}}, depending on the [[cultivar]] and on the timing of the cold, with the buds becoming less cold tolerant in late winter.<ref>{{cite journal| author1=Szalay, L. |author2=Papp, J. |author3=Szaóbo, Z. |year=2000 |title=Evaluation of frost tolerance of peach varieties in artificial freezing tests |journal=Acta Horticulturae |volume=538 |issue=538 |pages=407–410 |doi=10.17660/ActaHortic.2000.538.71}}</ref>

Another climate constraint is spring frost. The trees flower fairly early (in March in Western Europe), and the blossom is damaged or killed if temperatures drop below about {{convert|-4|C|F}}. If the flowers are not fully open, though, they can tolerate a few degrees colder.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chunxian Chen, William R. Okie, Thomas G. Beckman|date=Jul 2016|title=Peach Fruit Set and Buttoning after Spring Frost|journal=American Society for Horticultural Science|volume= 51: Issue 7|issue=7|pages=816–821|doi=10.21273/HORTSCI.51.7.816|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Climates with significant winter rainfall at temperatures below {{convert|16|C|F}} are also unsuitable for peach cultivation, as the rain promotes [[leaf curl|peach leaf curl]], which is the most serious fungal disease for peaches. In practice, fungicides are extensively used for peach cultivation in such climates, with more than 1% of European peaches exceeding legal pesticide limits in 2013.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=EFSA Journal |year=2015 |volume=13 |issue=3 |page=4038 |doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2015.4038 |url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/4038|title=The 2013 European Union report on pesticide residues in food |author=European Food Safety Authority |quote=The highest maximum residue level (MRL) exceedance rate was found for strawberries (2.5% of the samples), followed by lettuce (2.3%), oats (1.3%), peaches (1.1%), and apples (1.0%). |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315131732/http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/4038|archive-date=15 March 2015|doi-access=free }}</ref>

Finally, summer heat is required to mature the crop, with mean temperatures of the hottest month between {{convert|20|and|30|C|F}}.

=== Cultivars ===
[[File:White peach and cross section edit.jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|White peach of the clingstone variety]]
Hundreds of peach and nectarine cultivars are known. These are classified into two categories—freestones and clingstones. Freestones are those whose flesh separates readily from the pit. Clingstones are those whose flesh clings tightly to the pit. Some cultivars are partially freestone and clingstone, so are called semifree. Freestone types are preferred for eating fresh, while clingstone types are for canning. The fruit flesh may be creamy white to deep yellow, to dark red; the hue and shade of the color depend on the cultivar.<ref name=uri2000>{{cite web|title=Peach and Nectarine Culture |publisher=University of Rhode Island |year=2000 |url=http://www.uri.edu/ce/factsheets/sheets/peaches.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114152342/http://www.uri.edu/ce/factsheets/sheets/peaches.html |archive-date=14 January 2013 }}</ref>

Peach breeding has favored cultivars with more firmness, more red color, and shorter fuzz on the fruit surface. These characteristics ease shipping and supermarket sales by improving eye appeal. This selection process has not necessarily led to increased flavor, though. Peaches have a short shelf life, so commercial growers typically plant a mix of different cultivars to have fruit to ship all season long.<ref>{{cite web |title=Varieties – Peaches |author=Okie, W.R. |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |year=2005 |url=http://www.ent.uga.edu/peach/peachhbk/preplant/varieties.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114152347/http://www.ent.uga.edu/peach/peachhbk/preplant/varieties.pdf |archive-date=14 January 2013}}</ref>

=== Nectarines ===
[[File:White nectarine and cross section02 edit.jpg|thumb|White nectarines, whole and cut open]]

The variety ''P. persica'' var. ''nucipersica'' (or var. ''nectarina''), commonly called nectarine, has a smooth skin. It is on occasion referred to as a "shaved peach" or "fuzzless peach", due to its lack of fuzz or short hairs. Though fuzzy peaches and nectarines are regarded commercially as different fruits, with nectarines often erroneously believed to be a crossbreed between peaches and [[plum]]s, or a "peach with a plum skin", nectarines belong to the same species as peaches. Several genetic studies have concluded nectarines are produced due to a [[recessive allele]], whereas a fuzzy peach skin is [[dominant gene|dominant]].<ref name=osu/> Nectarines have arisen many times from peach trees, often as [[bud sport]]s.

As with peaches, nectarines can be white or yellow, and clingstone or freestone. On average, nectarines are slightly smaller and sweeter than peaches, but with much overlap.<ref name=osu /> The lack of skin fuzz can make nectarine skins appear more reddish than those of peaches, contributing to the fruit's plum-like appearance. The lack of down on nectarines' skin also means their skin is more easily bruised than peaches.

The history of the nectarine is unclear; the first recorded mention in English is from 1616,<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''</ref> but they had probably been grown much earlier within the native range of the peach in central and eastern Asia. Although one source states that nectarines were introduced into the United States by [[David Fairchild]] of the Department of Agriculture in 1906,<ref>{{Cite book

The 28 March 1768 edition of the ''New York Gazette'' (p.&nbsp;3), for example, mentions a farm in Jamaica, Long Island, New York, where nectarines were grown.

=== Peacherines ===
Peacherines are claimed to be a cross between a peach and a nectarine, but as they are the same species cannot be a true cross (hybrid); they are marketed in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. The fruit is intermediate in appearance, though, between a peach and a nectarine, large and brightly colored like a red peach. The flesh of the fruit is usually yellow, but white varieties also exist. The [[Koanga Institute]] lists varieties that ripen in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] in February and March.<ref name=Koanga>{{cite web|url=http://koanga.org.nz/knowledgebase/fruit-tree-knowledge/fruit-tree-collection/almonds-nectarines-peacherines-and-apricots/|publisher=Koanga Institute|title=Almonds, Nectarines, Peacherines and Apricots|access-date=8 January 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140215091505/http://koanga.org.nz/knowledgebase/fruit-tree-knowledge/fruit-tree-collection/almonds-nectarines-peacherines-and-apricots/|archive-date=15 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Shimabukuro|first=Betty|title=Mixed marriages: Cross-pollination produces fruit "children" that aren't quite the same as mom and dad|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2004/07/07/features/story1.html|access-date=8 January 2014|newspaper=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]|date=7 July 2004|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302215633/http://archives.starbulletin.com/2004/07/07/features/story1.html|archive-date=2 March 2012}}</ref>

In 1909, ''Pacific Monthly'' mentioned peacherines in a news bulletin for California. Louise Pound, in 1920, claimed the term peacherine is an example of language stunt.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Stunts in language|author=Pound, Louise |journal=The English Language|volume=9|year=1920|jstor=802441|issue=2|pages=88–95 }}</ref>

=== Flat peaches ===
{{Main|Flat peach}}
Flat peaches, or ''pan-tao'', have a flattened shape, in contrast to ordinary near-spherical peaches.<ref>{{cite book |last =Layne|first =Desmond|page=16| publisher=CABI | title = The Peach: Botany, Production and uses | year =2008| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=Ak2YiPi20d4C&q=flat%20saucer%20pan-tao%20peach&pg=PA16 | access-date = 3 August 2015 |isbn =978-1-84593-386-9}}</ref>

=== Planting ===
[[File:Nectarine Fruit Development.jpg|thumb|The developmental sequence of a nectarine over a {{frac|7|1|2}}-month period, from bud formation in early winter to fruit [[ripening]] in midsummer]]

Most peach trees sold by nurseries are cultivars [[Shield budding|budded]] or [[grafted]] onto a suitable [[rootstock]]. Common rootstocks are 'Lovell Peach', 'Nemaguard Peach', ''Prunus besseyi'', and 'Citation'.<ref>{{cite book | last = Ingels| first= Chuck | display-authors=etal | title=The Home Orchard: Growing Your Own Deciduous Fruit and Nut Trees | pages=29–30 | year=2007 | publisher=University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources}}</ref> The rootstock provides hardiness and budding is done to improve predictability of the fruit quality.

Peach trees need full sun, and a layout that allows good natural air flow to assist the thermal environment for the tree. Peaches are planted in early winter. During the growth season, they need a regular and reliable supply of water, with higher amounts just before harvest.<ref name=peachorchard>{{cite web|first=Dean|last=McCraw|url=http://pods.dasnr.okstate.edu/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-1026/HLA-6244web.pdf/|title=Planting and Early Care of the Peach Orchard|publisher=Oklahoma Cooperative Extension Service|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916052948/http://pods.dasnr.okstate.edu/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-1026/HLA-6244web.pdf|archive-date=16 September 2012}}</ref>

Peaches need [[nitrogen]]-rich fertilizers more than other fruit trees. Without regular fertilizer supply, peach tree leaves start turning yellow or exhibit stunted growth. [[Blood meal]], [[bone meal]], and calcium ammonium nitrate are suitable fertilizers.

The flowers on a peach tree are typically thinned out because if the full number of peaches mature on a branch, they are undersized and lack flavor. Fruits are thinned midway in the season by commercial growers. Fresh peaches are easily bruised, so do not store well. They are most flavorful when they ripen on the tree and are eaten the day of harvest.<ref name=peachorchard />

The peach tree can be grown in an [[espalier]] shape. The Baldassari palmette is a design created around 1950 used primarily for training peaches. In [[walled garden]]s constructed from stone or brick, which absorb and retain solar heat and then slowly release it, raising the temperature against the wall, peaches can be grown as espaliers against south-facing walls as far north as southeast Great Britain and southern Ireland.

=== Insects ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
The first [[Pest (organism)|pest]] to attack the tree early in the year when other food is scarce is the earwig (''[[Forficula auricularia]]'') which feeds on [[blossom]]s and young leaves at night, preventing fruiting and weakening newly planted trees. The pattern of damage is distinct from that of [[caterpillars]] later in the year, as earwigs characteristically remove semicircles of petal and leaf tissue from the tips, rather than internally. [[Greaseband]]s applied just before blossom are effective.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.garten-pur.de/index.php?board=25;action=display;threadid=35543;start=0 |title=Wer frisst Pfirsich-Blütenknopsen? |language=de |trans-title=Who eats peach blossom buds? |website=Garten-pur.de |date=9 April 2010 |access-date=1 January 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192720/http://forum.garten-pur.de/index.php?board=25;action=display;threadid=35543;start=0 |archive-date=2 January 2014 }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=April 2018}}

The larvae of such [[moth]] species as the peachtree borer (''[[Synanthedon exitiosa]]''), the yellow peach moth (''[[Conogethes punctiferalis]]''), the well-marked cutworm (''[[Abagrotis orbis]]''), ''[[Lyonetia prunifoliella]]'', ''[[Phyllonorycter hostis]]'', the fruit tree borer (''[[Maroga melanostigma]]''), ''[[Parornix anguliferella]]'', ''[[Parornix finitimella]]'', ''[[Caloptilia zachrysa]]'', ''[[Phyllonorycter crataegella]]'', ''[[Trifurcula sinica]]'', Suzuki's promolactis moth (''[[Promalactis suzukiella]]''), the white-spotted [[tussock moth]] (''[[Orgyia thyellina]]''), the apple leafroller (''[[Archips termias]]''), the catapult moth (''[[Serrodes partita]]''), the wood groundling (''[[Parachronistis albiceps]]'') or the omnivorous leafroller (''[[Platynota stultana]]'') are reported to feed on ''P. persica''. The flatid planthopper (''[[Metcalfa pruinosa]]'') causes damage to fruit trees.

The tree is also a host plant for such species as the [[Japanese beetle]] (''Popillia japonica''), the unmonsuzume (''[[Callambulyx tatarinovii]]''), the promethea silkmoth (''[[Callosamia promethea]]''), the orange oakleaf (''[[Kallima inachus]]''), ''[[Langia zenzeroides]]'', the speckled emperor (''[[Gynanisa maja]]'') or the brown playboy (''[[Deudorix antalus]]''). The European red mite (''[[Panonychus ulmi]]'') or the yellow mite (''[[Lorryia formosa]]'') are also found on the peach tree.

It is a good [[pollen source]] for [[honey bees]] and a [[List of honeydew sources|honeydew source]] for aphids.

=== Diseases ===
{{Main|List of peach and nectarine diseases}}
Peach trees are prone to a disease called [[leaf curl]], which usually does not directly affect the fruit, but does reduce the crop yield by partially defoliating the tree. Several fungicides can be used to combat the disease, including [[Bordeaux mixture]] and other copper-based products (the University of California considers these organic treatments), [[ziram]], [[chlorothalonil]], and [[dodine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/r540100311.html|publisher=[[UC Davis]]|title=UC Pest Management Guidelines|date=10 September 2015|access-date=3 November 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119030447/http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/r540100311.html|archive-date=19 January 2016}}</ref> The fruit is susceptible to [[Monilinia fructicola|brown rot]] or a dark reddish spot.

=== Storage ===
Peaches and nectarines are best stored at temperatures of 0&nbsp;°C (32&nbsp;°F) and in high humidity.<ref name=uri2000 /> They are highly perishable, so are typically consumed or canned within two weeks of harvest.

== Cultural significance ==
Peaches are not only a popular fruit, but also are symbolic in many cultural traditions, such as in art, paintings, and folk tales such as [[Peaches of Immortality]].

=== China ===
{{See also|Peaches of Immortality}}
Peach blossoms are highly prized in Chinese culture. The ancient Chinese believed the peach to possess more vitality than any other tree because their blossoms appear before leaves sprout. When early rulers of China visited their territories, they were preceded by sorcerers armed with peach rods to protect them from spectral evils. On New Year's Eve, local magistrates would cut peach wood branches and place them over their doors to protect against evil influences.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Researches into Chinese Superstitions|last1=Doré S.J.|first1=Henry|last2=Kennelly, S. J. (translator)|first2=M.|year=1914|publisher=Tusewei Press, Shanghai|volume= V|page=505}}</ref> Peach wood was also used for the earliest known [[door god]]s during the [[Han dynasty|Han]]. Another author writes:

{{Quote|The Chinese also considered peach wood (''t'ao-fu'') protective against evil spirits, who held the peach in awe. In ancient China, peach-wood bows were used to shoot arrows in every direction in an effort to dispel evil. Peach-wood slips or carved pits served as amulets to protect a person's life, safety, and health.<ref name="China 1991, Page 218">Simoons, Frederick J. (1991)  ''Food in China: A Cultural and Historical Inquiry'', p. 218, {{ISBN|0-8493-8804-X}}.</ref>}}

Peachwood seals or figurines guarded gates and doors, and, as one Han account recites, "the buildings in the capital are made tranquil and pure; everywhere a good state of affairs prevails".<ref name="China 1991, Page 218" /> Writes the author, further:

{{Quote|Another aid in fighting evil spirits were peach-wood wands. The Li-chi (Han period) reported that the emperor went to the funeral of a minister escorted by a sorcerer carrying a peachwood wand to keep bad influences away. Since that time, peachwood wands have remained an important means of exorcism in China.<ref name="China 1991, Page 218" />}} Peach kernels (桃仁 ''táo rén'') are a common ingredient used in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] to dispel blood [[Stasis (medicine)|stasis]], counter inflammation, and reduce allergies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcmlib.com/zy/html31/showdetail-333035312ce6a183e4bb812c7a79.html|title=TCM: Peach kernels|language=zh|access-date=1 November 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716194300/http://www.tcmlib.com/zy/html31/showdetail-333035312ce6a183e4bb812c7a79.html|archive-date=16 July 2011}}</ref>

In an orchard of flowering peach trees, [[Liu Bei]], [[Guan Yu]], and [[Zhang Fei]] took an oath of brotherhood in the opening chapter of the classic Chinese novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]''. Another peach orchard, in "[[The Peach Blossom Spring]]" by poet [[Tao Yuanming]], is the setting of the favourite Chinese fable and a metaphor for utopias. A peach tree growing on a precipice was where the Taoist master [[Zhang Daoling]] tested his disciples.<ref>{{cite book|author=Eskildsen, Stephen|title=Asceticism in early taoist religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=49WfkiAVEYsC&pg=PA26|year=1998|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-3955-5|page=26|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516191842/https://books.google.com/books?id=49WfkiAVEYsC&pg=PA26|archive-date=16 May 2016}}</ref>

The [[Old Man of the South Pole]], one of the deities of the Chinese folk religion ''[[Fu Lu Shou|fulu shou]]'', is sometimes seen holding a large peach, representing long life and health.{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}}

The term "[[Homosexuality in China#Terminology in China|bitten peach]]", first used by [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist philosopher]] [[Han Fei]] in his work ''Han Feizi'', became a byword for homosexuality. The book records the incident when courtier [[Mizi Xia]] bit into an especially delicious peach and gave the remainder to his lover, [[Duke Ling of Wei]], as a gift so that he could taste it, as well.{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}}

=== Korea ===
In Korea, peaches have been cultivated from ancient times. According to ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'', peach trees were planted during the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] period, and ''[[Sallim gyeongje]]'' also mentions cultivation skills of peach trees. The peach is seen as the fruit of happiness, riches, honours, and longevity. The rare peach with double seeds is seen as a favorable omen of a mild winter. It is one of the 10 immortal plants and animals, so peaches appear in many ''[[minhwa]]'' (folk paintings). Peaches and peach trees are believed to chase away spirits, so peaches are not placed on tables for ''[[jesa]]'' (ancestor veneration), unlike other fruits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=B&i=1013997&v=43 |script-title=ko:한국에서의 복숭아 재배 |trans-title=Peach cultivation in Korea |publisher=[[Nate (web portal)|Nate]] / [[Britannica]] |language=ko |access-date=12 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524221609/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=B&i=1013997&v=43 |archive-date=24 May 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=255510&v=43 |script-title=ko:복숭아 |trans-title=Peach |publisher=[[Nate (web portal)|Nate]] / [[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]] |language=ko |access-date=12 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524224042/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=255510&v=43 |archive-date=24 May 2012 }}</ref>

=== Japan ===
The world's sweetest peach is grown in [[Fukushima (city)|Fukushima]], Japan. The Guinness world record for the sweetest peach is currently held by a peach grown in Kanechika, Japan, with a sugar content of 22.2%. However, a fruit farm in rural Fukushima, Koji grew a much sweeter peach, with a Brix score of 32°. Degrees [[Brix]] measures the sugar content of the fruit, and is usually between 11 and 15 for a typical peach from a supermarket.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-07-17|title=The world's sweetest peach costs $7,000.

=== Vietnam ===
A Vietnamese mythic history states that in the spring of 1789, after marching to Ngọc Hồi and then winning a great victory against invaders from the [[Qing dynasty]] of China, Emperor [[Quang Trung]] ordered a messenger to gallop to [[Phú Xuân]] citadel (now [[Huế]]) and deliver a flowering peach branch to the Princess Ngọc Hân. This took place on the fifth day of the first lunar month, two days before the predicted end of the battle. The branch of peach flowers that was sent from the north to the centre of Vietnam was not only a message of victory from the King to his wife, but also the start of a new spring of peace and happiness for all the Vietnamese people. In addition, since the land of Nhật Tân had freely given that very branch of peach flowers to the King, it became the loyal garden of his dynasty.

The protagonists of ''[[The Tale of Kieu]]'' fell in love by a peach tree, and in [[Vietnam]], the blossoming peach flower is the signal of spring. Finally, peach [[bonsai]] trees are used as decoration during Vietnamese New Year ([[Tết]]) in northern Vietnam.{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}}

Many famous artists have painted with peach fruits placed in prominence. [[Caravaggio]], [[Vicenzo Campi]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Édouard Manet]], [[Henri Fantin-Latour]], [[Severin Roesen]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], and [[Van Gogh]] are among the many influential artists who painted peaches and peach trees in various settings.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Still Life With Peaches|author=Torpy, Janet M. |journal=JAMA|year= 2010|volume=303|pages=203|issue=3|doi=10.1001/jama.2009.1853|pmid=20085943 }}</ref><ref name=janick>{{cite web |url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop%20/Hort_306/reading/Reading%2040-1.pdf |title=Caravaggio's Fruit: A Mirror on Baroque Horticulture |author=Jules Janick |access-date=24 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114151216/http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop%20/Hort_306/reading/Reading%2040-1.pdf |archive-date=14 January 2013 }}</ref> Scholars suggest that many compositions are symbolic, some an effort to introduce realism.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Caravaggio – Still Life with Fruit on a Stone Ledge |title=Papers of the Muscarelle Museum of Art, Volume 1 |author1=de Groft |author2=Aaron H. |year=2006 |chapter-url=http://www.johntspike.com/uploads/CaravaggioFinalText12-23.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114152349/http://www.johntspike.com/uploads/CaravaggioFinalText12-23.pdf |archive-date=14 January 2013 }}</ref> For example, Tresidder claims<ref>{{cite book|title=1,001 Symbols: An Illustrated Guide to Imagery and Its Meaning|author=Tresidder, Jack |year=2004|isbn=978-0-8118-4282-2}}</ref> the artists of Renaissance symbolically used peach to represent heart, and a leaf attached to the fruit as the symbol for tongue, thereby implying speaking truth from one's heart; a ripe peach was also a symbol to imply a ripe state of good health. Caravaggio paintings introduce realism by painting peach leaves that are molted, discolored, or in some cases have wormholes – conditions common in modern peach cultivation.<ref name=janick />

=== United States ===
South Carolina named the peach its [[List of U.S. state foods|official fruit]] in 1984.<ref>{{citation |title= Plants & Edibles |publisher= South Carolina Legislature Online |url= https://www.scstatehouse.gov/studentpage/coolstuff/plants.shtml |access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref> The peach became the state fruit of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], nicknamed the "Peach State", in 1995.<ref>{{cite web |title=State Fruit |publisher=Georgia Secretary of State |work=Georgia State Symbols |url=http://sos.ga.gov/state_symbols/state_fruit.htm |access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref> The peach went from feral trees utilized opportunistically to a tended commercial crop in the Southern United States in the 1850s, as the [[boll weevil]] attacked regional cotton crops. When Georgia reached peak production in the 1920s, elaborate festivals celebrated the fruit.

Raw peach flesh is 89% water, 10% [[carbohydrate]]s, 1% [[protein]], and contains negligible [[fat]]. A medium sized raw peach, weighing {{convert|100|g|abbr=on}}, supplies 39 [[calorie]]s, and contains small amounts of [[essential nutrients]], but none is a significant proportion of the [[Daily Value]] (DV, right table).

Peach [[food allergy|allergy]] or [[food intolerance|intolerance]] is a relatively common form of hypersensitivity to [[protein]]s contained in peaches and related fruits (such as [[almond]]s). Symptoms range from local effects (e.g. [[oral allergy syndrome]], [[contact urticaria]]) to more severe systemic reactions, including [[anaphylaxis]] (e.g. [[urticaria]], [[angioedema]], gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms).<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.food-allergens.de/symposium-2-4/peach/peach-allergens.htm |title=Allergen Data Collection: Peach (''Prunus persica'') |author1=Besler, M. |author2=Cuesta Herranz, Javier |author3=Fernandez-Rivas, Montserrat |name-list-style=amp |journal=Internet Symposium on Food Allergens |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=185–201 |year=2000 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817132607/http://www.food-allergens.de/symposium-2-4/peach/peach-allergens.htm |archive-date=17 August 2009 }}</ref> Adverse reactions are related to the "freshness" of the fruit: peeled or canned fruit may be tolerated.

=== Aroma ===
