'''Danny Lee Snodgrass Jr.''' (born October 20, 1992), professionally known as '''Taz Taylor''', is an American record producer, songwriter, and record executive, as well as the founder of the '''Internet Money''' collective and record label.

He is solely signed to [[Warner Chappell Music]], [[Artist Partner Group|Artist Publishing Group]] and [[Atlantic Records]] on the publishing side, while currently signed as Internet Money Records with TenThousand Projects and [[Virgin Music Label & Artist Services|Virgin Music]] on the label side. He formerly signed a record deal with [[Todd Moscowitz|Alamo Records]] and [[Interscope Records]].

==Early life==
Danny Lee Snodgrass Jr. was born on October 20, 1992, in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], [[Florida]], where he was also raised. His father, the drummer for a local band, brought him to band practice where he began learning the drums, and guitar. Taylor lost interest in playing instruments as he grew up and dropped out of school in 7th grade. At the age of 17, his mother was diagnosed with cancer, and Taylor looked for a new way of earning income.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://revolt.tv/stories/2017/04/10/taz-taylor-interview-internet-producers-type-beats-0700bc777a|title=Taz Taylor and the war on internet producers|website=REVOLT TV|date=10 April 2017|language=en|access-date=2018-04-29}}</ref> After a brief stint as a graphic designer, Taylor turned to production. He sold his first beat online for $250, and began to produce full-time.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/3kvzxj/inside-the-underground-beat-market-shaping-soundcloud-rap-v24n8|title=Pay-Per-Beat: Inside the Underground Market Shaping Soundcloud Rap|date=2017-11-07|work=Noisey|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-us}}</ref>

==Career==
After realizing that he could make money selling beats online, Taylor pawned many of his possessions to furnish his in-home studio. As he developed his beat creation, he also developed his business strategy, which at first revolved around using Twitter and PayPal to sell his beats to any artist who wanted them. Taylor sells his creations via a one-time payment for usage of his material, eschewing the more complicated publishing and songwriting deals traditionally preferred by producers. In 2016, Taylor placed songs with [[Trey Songz]] and [[Desiigner]], which were his first major placements.<ref name=":0" /> This led to a publishing deal signed in August 2017 with [[Warner Chappell Music]], [[Mike Caren|Artist Publishing Group]] and [[Atlantic Records]], which allowed him to lease his works in the traditional way, as well as independently sell beats via his Internet Money YouTube channel.<ref name=":1" />
