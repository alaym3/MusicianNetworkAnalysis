The death of his maternal grandfather led McIlwee's father to begin attending mortuary school and begin working at the funeral home. When McIlwee was ten, his father developed a [[substance abuse]] problem, which led to him often being booked into drug rehabilitation centres up until the time McIlwee turned eighteen. When McIlwee was twelve, one of his aunts committed suicide. From the age of thirteen he was a frequent user of the internet, often spending his time on [[anime]] and [[wrestling]] message boards.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mascatello |first1=Lucas |title=Wicca Phase Springs Eternal Walks Us through the Cemetery of His Past |url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/wicca-phase-springs-eternal-walks-us-through-the-cemetery-of-his-past |access-date=23 February 2021}}</ref>
