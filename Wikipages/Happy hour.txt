'''Happy hour''' is a [[marketing]] term for a time when a venue (such as a [[restaurant]], [[Bar (establishment)|bar]], [[bowling alley]], [[stadium]], [[state fair]], or [[county fair]]) offers discounts on [[Alcoholic beverage|alcoholic drinks]].  Free [[Hors d'oeuvre|appetizers]] and discounted menu items are often served during happy hour.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}

==Origin==
The words "happy" and "hour" have appeared together for centuries when describing pleasant times. In act I, scene 2 of William Shakespeare's King Henry V, he says, "''Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour/That may give furtherance to our expedition...''" The use of the phrase "happy hour" to refer to a scheduled period of entertainment is, however, more recent.

One possible origin of the term "Happy Hour," in the sense of a scheduled period of entertainment, is from the [[United States Navy]].  In early 1913, a group of "home makers" called the "Happy Hour Social" organised "semi-weekly smokers" on board {{USS|Arkansas|BB-33|6}}.<ref name="Our Navy">{{cite journal|title=U.S.S. Arkansas|journal=Our Navy, the Standard Magazine of the United States Navy|date=March 1913|volume=6|issue=11|page=12}}</ref> The name "Happy Hour Club," "Happy Hour Social Club," and similar variants, had been in use as the names of social clubs, primarily by women's social clubs, since at least the early 1880s. By June 1913, the crew of ''Arkansas'' had started referring to their regularly scheduled smokers as "Happy Hours."<ref>{{cite journal|title=U.S.S.

The idea of drinking before dinner has its roots in the [[Prohibition era]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}  When the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|18th Amendment]] and the [[Volstead Act]] were passed banning alcohol consumption, people would host "cocktail hours", also known as "happy hours", at a [[speakeasy]] before eating at restaurants where alcohol could not be served. [[Cocktail lounge]]s continued the trend of drinking before dinner.

The ''Random House Dictionary of American Slang'' dates "Happy hour," as a term for afternoon drinks in a bar, to a ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' article on military life in 1959. The article detailed the lives of government contractors and military personnel who worked at missile-tracking facilities in the Caribbean and the Atlantic. "Except for those who spend too much during 'happy hour' at the bar – and there are few of these – the money mounts up fast."<ref name="Brown"/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=Harold H. |title=The Men Who Chase Missiles |journal=[[The Saturday Evening Post]] |date=April 25, 1959 |url=https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/issues/1959-04-25/ |url-access=subscription}}</ref> Barry Popick's online etymology dictionary, The Big Apple, lists several pre-1959 citations to "Happy Hour" in print, mostly from places near naval bases in California, from as early as 1951.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/happy_hour |last=Popick |first=Barry |title=Happy Hour |work=The Big Apple |date=2008-12-18 |access-date=2021-06-17}}</ref>

==Regulations==
===Canada===
The [[Canadian province|Province]] of [[Alberta]] created restrictions to happy hours that took effect in August 2008. All such promotions must end at 8:00 p.m, and drink prices must conform to the  [[Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission|Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission's]] minimum price regulations at all times.<ref>[http://www.aglc.gov.ab.ca/pdf/news/NR_MinDrinkPriceHappyHr_20080703.pdf Alberta sets new rules to improve bar safety]:Minimum drink prices, restricted happy hours among new policies to curb binge drinking.

In [[Ontario]], while establishments may vary liquor prices as long as they stay above the minimum prices set by the [[Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario]], they are not permitted to advertise these prices "in a manner that may promote immoderate consumption." Formerly, the phrase "happy hour" could not be used in such advertisement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.agco.on.ca/pdfs/en/info_bull/i9014.pdf |title=Pricing and Promotion of Liquor by Liquor Sales Licensees |work=Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario Information Bulletin |date=July 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416155518/http://www.agco.on.ca/pdfs/en/info_bull/i9014.pdf |archive-date=2017-04-16}}</ref> That restriction was removed in 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.agco.ca/bulletin/2019/info-bulletin-no-56-regulatory-modernization-and-burden-reduction-changes-ontarios |title=Info Bulletin No. 56 – Regulatory Modernization and Burden Reduction Changes in Ontario's Beverage Alcohol Industry |date=2019-05-06 |publisher=Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario}}</ref>

===Netherlands===

[[Alcohol laws of Massachusetts|Massachusetts]] was one of the first [[U.S. state]]s to implement a statewide ban on happy hours in 1984.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Campbell |first1=Colin |title='Happy Hour' Ban Starts In Massachusetts Bars |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/11/us/happy-hour-ban-starts-in-massachusetts-bars.html |access-date=December 8, 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 11, 1984 |page=A18}}</ref> Several other U.S. states also have similar restrictions. The reason for each ban varies, but include: to prevent drunk driving, avoid the nuisance to neighbors from loud crowds and public drunkenness, and to discourage unhealthy consumption of a large amount of alcohol in a short time.

In 1984, the U.S. military abolished happy hours at military base clubs.<ref>{{cite news|title=Differ on Minimum Age, 'Happy Hours' : Army, Navy in Dispute Over Drinking |date=March 3, 1985 |first=Michael |last=Weisskopf |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-03-03-mn-32704-story.html |url-access=subscription}}</ref> In 2011, the [[Utah State Legislature]] passed a ban on happy-hours, effective on 1 January 2012.
