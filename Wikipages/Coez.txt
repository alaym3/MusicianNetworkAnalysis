'''Silvano Albanese''' (born 11 July 1983, in [[Nocera Inferiore]], Italy) and better known by his stage name '''Coez''' is an Italian singer and rapper.

== Career ==
Born in Nocera Inferiore in the province of Salerno, he grew up in Rome. He studied comedy at Scuola Cinematografica and his first musical project was Circolo Vizioso in collaboration with Franz and Nicco. After a self-titled mixtape, he released his first official release ''Terapia'' produced by Ford 78 and Sine.

In 2007, he met Lucci and Bruno Cannavicci (better known as Snais), who were members of the band Unabombers, and with addition of Franz and Nicco from Circolo Vizioso days, the five formed the collective Brokenspeakers. The formation had great success all over Italy even opening for [[Busta Rhymes]].

In parallel with working with the Brokenspeakers, Coez took a solo career and in 2009 released his solo album ''Figlio di nessuno'' that also included collaborations with Lucci, Hube, Nicco & Franz, Julia and Supremo73. In November 2011, he released the mixtape Fenomeno mixed with DJ Sine. Coez's first big commercially successful solo single was "Nella casa" followed by the album ''Non erano fiori'' on the Carosello Records and in collaboration with Riccardo Sinigallia. The album reached the Top 10 of the official Italian Albums Chart. He was also featured as a newcomer artist in the Music Summer Festival. In 2014, he collaborated with Gemitaiz & MadMan and in September 2015, he released ''Niente che non va'' with the single "La rabbia dei secondi" from the album. On May 5, 2017, he released his fourth solo album, ''Faccio un casino'' reaching #2 on the Italian Albums Chart. It was certified gold. The title track made it to the Top 10 on the Italian Singles Chart with a second track "La musica non c'è" topping the Italian Singles Chart making it his first #1 hit in Italy. ''Faccio un casino'' was nominated for [[IMPALA]]'s European Album of the Year Award.<ref>{{cite web |url=//impalamusic.org/content/22-acts-running-best-european-independent-album |title=22 acts in the running for best European independent album |date=6 March 2018 |access-date=6 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309054152/http://impalamusic.org/content/22-acts-running-best-european-independent-album |archive-date=9 March 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
