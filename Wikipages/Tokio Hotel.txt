Devilish changed their name to Tokio Hotel: "Tokio", the German spelling of the Japanese city [[Tokyo]], due to a love of the city, and "Hotel" due to their constant touring and living in hotels.<ref name="tokio hotel interview"/> Soon after [[Sony BMG]] took them under contract, Hoffmann hired David Jost and Pat Benzner into the team of creators and authors, and had them give the teens instruction on songwriting and instrument playing; most of the songs of the first album were written by Hoffmann, Jost and Benzer (including the singles "Scream" and "Rescue me" which were completely written by them), only the single "Unendlichkeit" was written completely by Tokio Hotel themselves. Shortly before release of their first album, Sony terminated their contract.

[[File:Bill Kaulitz stage.png|thumb|Bill Kaulitz performing in Hessisch-Lichtenau, Germany in 2006]]

In 2005 [[Universal Music Group]] took Tokio Hotel under contract and developed a marketing plan. Their first single, "[[Durch den Monsun]]" ("Through the Monsoon"), quickly rose in the charts, appearing on the German official [[Media Control Charts|Media Control]] single chart at No.&nbsp;15 on 20 August 2005 and eventually reaching No.&nbsp;1 on 26 August 2005; it also reached No.&nbsp;1 on the [[Ö3 Austria Top 40|Austrian singles chart]]. Their second single, "[[Schrei (song)|Schrei]]" ("Scream"), climbed to the No.&nbsp;5 position in the German charts. These two songs were written by singer Bill Kaulitz together with their group of producers Peter Hoffmann, David Jost, Pat Benzer and Dave Roth. Their debut album, ''[[Schrei]]'', was released on 19 September 2005, and was certified triple gold by the [[Bundesverband Musikindustrie|BVMI]] in 2006 for selling over 300,000 copies in Germany.<ref name="Certification">

</ref> In 2006, a third and fourth single, "[[Rette mich (Tokio Hotel song)|Rette mich]]" ("Rescue Me") and "[[Der letzte Tag (Tokio Hotel song)|Der letzte Tag]]" ("The Final Day"), were released; both reached No.&nbsp;1 as well. "Der letzte Tag" contained a B-side called "Wir schließen uns ein", which was also accompanied by a music video.

===''Zimmer 483'' and ''Scream'' (2007–2008)===
The first single off their second album ''Zimmer 483'' (''Room 483''), called "[[Übers Ende der Welt]]" (later re-released in English under the name "[[Ready, Set, Go!]]"), was released on 26 January 2007 and quickly reached No.&nbsp;1 in Germany and Austria, and No.&nbsp;2 in France. ''Zimmer 483'' was released in Germany on 23 February 2007, along with a deluxe edition of the album containing a DVD. The album's second single, "[[Spring nicht]]" ("Don't Jump") was released on 7 April. The tour accompanying the release of the album, The Zimmer 483 Tour, scheduled to start in March 2007, was delayed by two weeks because the band members wished to have a different stage design. A third single, "[[An deiner Seite (Ich bin da)]]" ("By Your Side"), was released on 16 November. The single contains the B-side "1000 Meere" ("1000 Oceans"), for which a music video was also produced.{{by whom|date=December 2016}}
On 28 April 2008 Tokio Hotel released their single "[[Heilig (Tokio Hotel song)|Heilig]]" but no music video for the single was released, because of the tight schedule they had.

Tokio Hotel's first English-language album, ''[[Scream (Tokio Hotel album)|Scream]]'', was released on 4 June 2007 throughout Europe. In Germany, the album was released as ''Room 483'' in order to emphasize the continuity with their last German album ''Zimmer 483''. ''Scream'' contains English versions of a selection of songs from Tokio Hotel's German-language albums ''[[Schrei]]'' and ''Zimmer 483''. "[[Monsoon (song)|Monsoon]]", the English-language version of "Durch den Monsun", was the first single from the album. "[[Ready, Set, Go!]]" (the translation of "[[Übers Ende der Welt]]") was released as the album's second single and "[[Don't Jump]]" (the translation of "Spring nicht") as the third single. A video for "[[Schrei (song)|Scream]]", the English-language version of their 2005 hit "Schrei", was also recorded, and was released to the [[iTunes Store]] in early March 2008.

Tokio Hotel gave their first concert in the United Kingdom on 19 June 2007. "[[Ready, Set, Go!]]" was released in the UK as the band's first single on 27 August 2007. The song reached No.&nbsp;77 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].

Tokio Hotel won an [[MTV Europe Music Award]] for Best InterAct on 1 November 2007 and were also nominated for Best Band. They performed "Monsoon" at the event.

Tokio Hotel released their first US single, simply called "Tokio Hotel", in late 2007. The single contains the tracks "Scream" and "Ready, Set, Go!", and was available exclusively at [[Hot Topic]] stores. Their second US single, "Scream America", was released on 11 December 2007. The single contains the track "Scream" and a remix of "Ready, Set, Go!" by [[AFI (band)|AFI]]'s [[Jade Puget]]. In February 2008, the band toured North America for five dates, starting in Canada and finishing up in New York.<ref name=NYT /> After Tokio Hotel had appeared and performed live on [[MuchMusic]] while touring in Canada, "Ready, Set, Go!" entered the [[MuchOnDemand]] Daily 10, a countdown of videos chosen by viewers. It remained there for over a week, then returned to the top of the MOD Daily 10 chart on 8 April. "Scream" was released in Canada on 25 March and in the US on 6 May.

The "1000 Hotels" European Tour began on 3 March 2008 in [[Brussels]] and continued through locations including the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Serbia and [[Scandinavia]]. It was scheduled to finish on 9 April; during the concert in [[Marseille]], France, on 14 March, Bill started to experience vocal problems.<ref name="BravoOp">Kautz, Julia, "Das Ende von Tokio Hotel?", pp. 10, 11, 12 & 13, ''Bravo'', Issue 15, April 2008</ref> He let the audience sing more frequently than normal, and instead of the original 21 songs on the set list, the band played only 16 songs. Bill apologized, in German, for his bad singing and explained that he was sick. Two days later, the band cancelled the [[Lisbon]], Portugal concert minutes before it was supposed to commence. The rest of the "1000 Hotels" Tour and a scheduled North American Tour were cancelled after the band's manager announced in ''[[Bild]]'' that Bill Kaulitz had to undergo surgery to remove a cyst on his vocal cords.<ref>"Wie schlecht geht es Bill wirklich", ''Bild'',  5 April 2008</ref><ref>"Noch mehr US-Konzerte abgesagt", ''Bild'',  26 April 2008</ref>

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Tokio Hotel 2016-2018.jpg|thumb|right|Logo and emblem used from 2016 to 2018. The logo text is still currently being used]] -->
During an interview in May 2016, Bill Kaulitz announced that there would be a new album titled ''[[Dream Machine (album)|Dream Machine]]'' and a new world tour in 2017. In late December 2016 as promotion for the album, the band released the first two songs from the album on YouTube. The first, "Something New", was released on 23 December and the second, "What If", was released on 29 December.

On 2 January 2017, the band announced via their official Facebook page that ''Dream Machine'' would be released on 3 March 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/tokiohotel/|title=Tokio Hotel|website=www.facebook.com}}</ref> While they are no longer with Universal Music, they have since signed with [[Starwatch Music]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mediabiz.de/musik/news/tokio-hotel-unterschreiben-bei-starwatch/413688 |title=Tokio Hotel unterschreiben bei Starwatch |access-date= 24 January 2017}}</ref>

On 25 September 2017, Tokio Hotel announced their North America tour dates for 2018,<ref>{{cite web |title=Dream Machine Tour Dates 2018 |url=https://www.axs.com/uk/tokio-hotel-announces-2018-north-american-dates-for-dream-machine-tour-123461 |website=AXS |access-date=8 December 2020}}</ref> however these dates were later cancelled due to technical issues with the band's equipment.

===''Melancholic Paradise'', ''Durch den Monsun 2020'' and ''Monsoon 2020'' (2018–2020)===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Tokio Hotel Emblem 2020.jpg|thumb|right|The emblem being used today]] -->
On 29 October 2018, the band announced via their official Facebook page that they will be embarking on a new tour in 2019 named "Melancholic Paradise" wherein they will perform both familiar songs and new ones from their upcoming album. Only Europe dates have been announced at that time. The singles "[[Melancholic Paradise]]", "[[When It Rains It Pours (Tokio Hotel song)|When It Rains It Pours]]" and "[[Chateau (Tokio Hotel song)|Chateau]]" were respectively released on 1 February 2019, 5 April 2019, and 17 November 2019.

In October 2019, Bill Kaulitz announced via his Instagram account that the upcoming Tokio Hotel album has been finished with the recording sessions and that it will be released in 2020. Also, the next day, he has announced via his Instagram account that the band has added North America and Latin America legs to their "Melancholic Paradise Tour" for the same year with the release of the band sixth studio album. The band had only completed three venues on their North America and Latin America tour and the rest of the tour was since cancelled at the last minute before their show in [[Ecuador]] due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] and resulting [[COVID-19 lockdowns|lockdowns]] worldwide.

All photos, videos and content were removed from Tokio Hotel's official Instagram account early August 2020, and older photos of the band were uploaded instead. This was later revealed to be due to the 15th anniversary of the release of the band's debut single "[[Durch den Monsun]]" on 15 August 2005.

During a live chat on Spotify, the band confirmed that new versions of "Durch den Monsun" and "Monsoon" will be released some time in Autumn 2020 as a celebration of the single's 15th anniversary. "Durch den Monsun 2020" and "Monsoon 2020" were respectively released on 2 October 2020<ref name ='"Durch den Monsun 2020" Release Date'>{{cite web |title="Durch den Monsun 2020" release date.|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/CFr94iwCG2-/?hl=en |website=Instagram |access-date=28 September 2020}}</ref> and 16 October 2020.<ref name ='"Monsoon 2020" release date'>{{cite web |title="Monsoon 2020" release date.|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/CGAhxiLq8So/?hl=en |website=Instagram |access-date=6 October 2020}}</ref> Bill also confirmed that a new German-language song will be released later this year, and that a new tour is planned in 2021 for Europe and other continents. On 1 September 2020, Tokio Hotel revealed to have signed a new record deal with [[Sony Music|Sony Music Germany]] and [[Epic Records|Epic Records Germany]] throughout their official Instagram account.

Tokio Hotel announced on 4 December 2020 via Instagram their new single "[[Berlin (Tokio Hotel song)|Berlin]]", featuring a guest appearance from Canadian singer VVAVES, which was released on 11 December 2020.

===''Beyond the World'' and upcoming seventh studio album (2020–present)===
On 7 December 2020, the band announced via their official Facebook page and Instagram account that they will be embarking on a new tour in Autumn 2021 named "Beyond the World",<ref name ='Tokio Hotel "Beyond the World" tour'>{{cite web |title=Tokio Hotel "Beyond the World" tour |url=https://www.handwerker-promotion.de/kuenstler/tokio-hotel/ |website=Handwerker Promotion |access-date=7 December 2020}}</ref> promoting "Durch den Monsun 2020" and "Monsoon 2020", whilst wishing to perform more songs from their upcoming album. Only Europe dates have been announced at that time.

Via their #AskTokioHotel livestream on Twitter, the band have announced a new single called "[[White Lies (Tokio Hotel song)|White Lies]]", which will feature a guest appearance from German [[Electronic Dance Music|EDM]] duo [[Vize (DJs)|VIZE]]. This was released on 15 January 2021.

On 16 December 2020, the band appeared on [[Sputnik (radio station)|MDR Sputnik]]'s talk show ''Friends of Sputnik'', where they were interviewed by host Sissy Metzschke, and later performed the songs; "Durch den Monsun 2020", "Love Who Loves You Back", "Black", "Melancholic Paradise" and "Berlin". On 7 February 2021, the band appeared on ''[[Super Bowl LV]]'' on [[ProSieben]], on which they performed the songs; "When It Rains It Pours", "Covered in Gold", "We Found Us", "What If", "White Lies" and "Stormy Weather".

On 19 March 2021, the band started a social media contest called the White Lies Cover Challenge, where they asked fans to create their own cover of "White Lies" on video and to submit it by 4 April 2021 on Instagram, Facebook or Twitter using the hashtag #WhiteLiesCoverChallenge. The winning covers would then be used by the band in a fan video version of the song, which was uploaded to their official YouTube account on 15 April 2021.

The band had a new Instagram livestream on 25 March 2021, on which they announced a new song would be released on 28 May 2021. The new song will be a dance cover of "[[Behind Blue Eyes]]" by [[classic rock]] legend [[The Who]], and like "White Lies", the cover will also feature a guest appearance from VIZE. The band also announced a remix version of "White Lies" with German DJ NOØN, which was released on 2 April 2021. Another remix version of the song with German DJ duo HBz was released on 7 May 2021.

On 14 May 2021 the band have postponed the European leg of their ''Beyond the World Tour'' until Spring 2022. This is due to the ongoing [[COVID-19 pandemic]], [[COVID-19 lockdowns|global lockdowns]] and [[Travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic|restrictions]].

Instead of the planned date of 28 May 2021, "[[Behind Blue Eyes]]" was released on 27 May 2021 to coincide with the band's live performance of the song on [[ProSieben]]'s [[Germany's Next Topmodel]] on the same day.

On 7 June 2021 the band started a social media contest called the Behind Blue Eyes Cover Challenge, where, like with "White Lies", they asked fans to create their own cover of "Behind Blue Eyes" on video and to submit it on Instagram, Facebook or Twitter using the hashtag #BBE_challenge. The winning covers would then be used by the band in a fan video version of the song.

On 9 August 2021 Bill Kaulitz has revealed on a post on his official Instagram account that a new single will be released on  27 August 2021.<ref name ='New song on 27 August 2021'>{{cite web |title=New song on 27 August 2021 |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/CSXBOYylv1E/?hl=en |website=Instagram |access-date=15 August 2020}}</ref>

A new single called "Sorry Not Sorry" was released by German singer Badchieff on 27 August 2021 with Tokio Hotel making a guest appearance.

On 27 August 2021 the band appeared on [[Gamescom|Gamescom 2021]] (known as Spielesause 2021 in Germany), where they performed "White Lies", "Behind Blue Eyes" and "Sorry Not Sorry" with Badchieff.

On 4 October 2021 the band announced a new single called "Here Comes the Night" via Instagram. This was released on 22 October 2021.
