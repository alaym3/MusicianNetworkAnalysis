In November 2020, Little Mix's publicist stated that Nelson would take an extended break from the pop group for "private medical reasons".<ref>{{cite news |title=Little Mix: Jesy Nelson takes break for medical reasons |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-54979741 |work=BBC News |date=17 November 2020 |access-date=18 November 2020 |archive-date=17 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201117201324/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-54979741 |url-status=live }}</ref> On 14 December 2020, Nelson announced her departure from Little Mix due to struggles with her mental health.<ref name="departure"/>

In August 2021, Nelson spoke in an interview about her time on ''The X Factor'' and criticised the show for the lack of support she received after being subjected to online trolling. In the interview she spoke about the eating disorder she had developed through extreme dieting during her time with Little Mix, and the panic attacks she would experience.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Hattenstone|first=Simon|date=21 August 2021|title=Jesy Nelson on leaving Little Mix: 'I felt everybody hated me'|url=https://theguardian.com/music/2021/aug/21/jesy-nelson-on-leaving-little-mix-i-felt-everybody-hated-me|access-date=21 August 2021|work=[[The Guardian]]|archive-date=21 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210821075308/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/aug/21/jesy-nelson-on-leaving-little-mix-i-felt-everybody-hated-me|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Online bullying and body image===
Before Little Mix's sixth studio album [[Confetti (Little Mix album)|''Confetti'']] was released, Nelson took some time out of the group's promotion schedule, citing a private medical matter.<ref>{{Cite web|date=18 November 2020|title=Little Mix's Jesy Nelson taking time off for 'private medical reasons'|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/17/jesy-nelson-of-little-mix-taking-time-off-for-private-medical-reasons|access-date=25 August 2021|website=the Guardian|language=en|archive-date=25 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210825095722/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/17/jesy-nelson-of-little-mix-taking-time-off-for-private-medical-reasons|url-status=live}}</ref> On 14 December, she announced she was leaving the group due to the impact on her mental health. In a statement, she said: "I find the constant pressure of being in a girl group and living up to expectations very hard."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Archived copy|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-55309903|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201214172407/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-55309903|work=BBC News|archive-date=14 December 2020|access-date=14 December 2020}}</ref>

In August 2021, Nelson told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that since her first appearance on [[The X Factor (British TV series)|''The X Factor'']] with Little Mix she had been trolled about her physical appearance on social media. Although the group supported Nelson's frailties, she said that ''The X Factor'' should pair a therapist or psychologist with the coaches. Nelson went in to therapy, where she was told she had an eating disorder.<ref name=":02">{{Cite news|date=21 August 2021|title=Jesy Nelson on leaving Little Mix: ‘I felt everybody hated me’|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/aug/21/jesy-nelson-on-leaving-little-mix-i-felt-everybody-hated-me|access-date=25 August 2021|work=The Guardian|language=en|archive-date=25 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210825011913/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/aug/21/jesy-nelson-on-leaving-little-mix-i-felt-everybody-hated-me|url-status=live}}</ref>

Nelson said that she was often dressed differently from the other three members of Little Mix because her body shape did not lend itself to the outfits. After the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] and the decision to shoot the video for "[[Sweet Melody (song)|Sweet Melody]]" she had gained weight and did not feel fit for filming, deciding to go on a drastic diet without getting results.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Jesy Nelson quit Little Mix after panic attack on 'Sweet Melody' set|url=https://www.capitalfm.com/news/jesy-nelson-little-mix-sweet-melody-video/|access-date=25 August 2021|website=Capital|language=en|archive-date=25 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210825095723/https://www.capitalfm.com/news/jesy-nelson-little-mix-sweet-melody-video/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":02" /> After she was hospitalised, her mother told the other members that she had to leave the group.<ref name=":02" /><ref>{{Cite web|date=22 August 2021|title=Jesy Nelson opens up about mental health struggles following internet trolling|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/jesy-nelson-opens-up-about-mental-health-struggles-following-internet-trolling-3025211|access-date=25 August 2021|website=NME|language=en-GB|archive-date=25 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210825095720/https://www.nme.com/news/music/jesy-nelson-opens-up-about-mental-health-struggles-following-internet-trolling-3025211|url-status=live}}</ref> She said that some backstage people associated with Little Mix were glad to see her go.<ref name=":02" /> In 2019, [[BBC Three]] released a documentary titled ''Jesy Nelson: Odd One Out'', which details Nelson's experiences with body image and the impact of online bullying on her life and mental health.<ref>{{Cite web|title=BBC Three - Jesy Nelson: 'Odd One Out'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07lsr4d|access-date=25 August 2021|website=BBC|language=en-GB|archive-date=21 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210821111950/https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07lsr4d|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Accusations of cultural appropriation ===
In June 2018, Nelson posted an image of herself on [[Instagram]] wearing her hair in [[dreadlocks]]. The photo was later deleted after she was criticised over accusations of [[cultural appropriation]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=20 February 2018|title=Little Mix singer criticised for wearing dreads|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-43126568|access-date=17 August 2021|archive-date=17 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210817181633/https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-43126568|url-status=live}}</ref>

In May 2021, Nelson was accused of "[[blackfishing]]" (a form of cultural appropriation).<ref>{{cite news|date=17 May 2021|title=Jesy Nelson Accused of Blackfishing in New Exposé|work=[[Yahoo!

A [[BuzzFeed]] article was written about Nelson which documented how she had changed her physical appearance since joining Little Mix. The article suggested that changing features such as her skin tone and lip size had led Nelson to become "racially ambiguous",<ref name="Tab2">{{cite news|last1=Brocklehurst|first1=Harrison|title=Jesy Nelson is being called out for 'blackfishing'|work=[[The Tab]]|url=https://thetab.com/uk/2021/05/17/jesy-nelson-called-out-for-blackfishing-205601|access-date=29 May 2021|archive-date=2 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210602214150/https://thetab.com/uk/2021/05/17/jesy-nelson-called-out-for-blackfishing-205601|url-status=live}}</ref> also noting how her skin tone has frequently appeared darker than that of former bandmates Pinnock and Thirlwall, both of whom are women of colour.<ref name="Tab2" />

In 2021, after the release of her music video for "Boyz", Nelson faced criticism online for her appearance in the music video, with people commenting on her accent and darkened skin. This led to further accusations of both cultural appropriation and blackfishing.<ref>{{Cite web|date=11 October 2021|title=Jesy Nelson responds to Blackfishing accusations following debut single|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/jesy-nelson-responds-to-blackfishing-accusations-i-would-never-intentionally-do-anything-to-make-myself-look-racially-ambiguous-3066841|access-date=11 October 2021|website=NME|language=en-GB}}</ref>
