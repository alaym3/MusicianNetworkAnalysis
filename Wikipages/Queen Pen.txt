'''Lynise Walters''' (born 1972), better known by her stage name '''Queen Pen''', is an American [[rapper]], singer, and [[novelist]]. She also has experience as a [[record producer]], and has received a [[Soul Train]] nomination for Best New Artist. She has dealt with some controversy in relation to her use of lesbian themes&mdash;it being a taboo within hip-hop&mdash;in some of her music. Walters has written eight novels.

==Career==

Her music career launched after she became a protégé of [[Teddy Riley]], a record producer and member of the [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] group [[Blackstreet]] in the mid-1990s. Although she was not listed on the song, she was a featured artist alongside [[Dr. Dre]] in Blackstreet's 1996 hit, "[[No Diggity]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1487-will-the-mainstream-support-more-than-one-rap-queen-at-a-time-a-charts-investigation/|title=Will the Mainstream Support More Than One Rap Queen at a Time?

==Personal life==
After the release of the single, "Girlfriend", that contained themes that were taboo in the hip-hop community at the time, some media sources presumed Queen Pen to be an openly gay or bisexual woman.<ref name="daveyd"/><ref name="nytimes">{{cite web|last=Jamison|first=Laura|title=A Feisty Female Rapper Breaks a Hip-Hop Taboo|url=http://www.prismnet.com/~larrybob/queenpen.html|work=[[New York Times]]|publisher=prismnet.com|date=January 18, 1998|access-date=May 16, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Haye|first=Christian|title=The Grimee|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/the_grimee/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218171647/http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/the_grimee/|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 18, 2008|work=Frieze Magazine|publisher=frieze.com|date=August 15, 1998|access-date=May 16, 2013}}</ref> During the song's release, Pen remained coy about her sexuality and would not disclose it unless it was going to be a "front page" story.<ref name="nytimes"/> She also added that if she told the press she was straight, she would be viewed as a liar; in turn, if she were to say she was gay, she would be viewed as someone trying to get publicity.<ref name="nytimes"/> In 2001, Pen officially disclosed to the press that she was neither gay nor bisexual.<ref>Flowers, Nina.

==Controversy==

===Feud with Foxy Brown===
In 1998, a dispute between [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]] and Queen Pen developed over Pen's controversial lesbian-themed single "Girlfriend."<ref name="daveyd">{{Cite web|last=D|first=Davey|title=May '98 Hip Hop News|url=http://www.daveyd.com/fnvmaynews.html|work=Davey D's Hip Hop Corner|publisher=daveyd.com|date=May 15, 1998|access-date=May 16, 2013}}</ref> Brown, who took offense of the song's subject, spewed homophobic remarks to both Pen and former rival [[Queen Latifah]] via her diss record "10% Dis".<ref name="daveyd"/><ref name="rapgenius">{{cite web|title=Funkmaster Flex – 10% Dis Lyrics|url=http://rapgenius.com/Funkmaster-flex-10-dis-lyrics|work=[[Rap Genius]]|publisher=rapgenius.com|access-date=May 8, 2013}}</ref> In response, Pen reportedly confronted Brown while barefoot in the lobby of Nevada's Reno Hilton during the Impact Music Convention and tried to slap and chase her down an elevator.<ref name="daveyd"/><ref name="vibe3">"Vibe Confidential: Everything You Want to Know Before You're Supposed to Know It."

Again, the conflict was subdued before any further physical contact occurred.<ref name="vibe3"/>

In late 1998, Brown released another diss track titled "Talk to Me", which contained more homophobic remarks to Pen and Latifah.<ref name="rapgenius2">{{cite web|title=Foxy Brown – Talk To Me Lyrics|url=http://rapgenius.com/Foxy-brown-talk-to-me-lyrics|work=[[Rap Genius]]|publisher=rapgenius.com|access-date=May 8, 2013}}</ref> In 2001, Pen subliminally responded to the diss track via her record "I Got Cha," in which Pen called Brown as a "bum bitch," and later made remarks about her being funny and fake "like a drag queen."<ref>{{cite web|title=Queen Pen – I Got Cha Lyrics|url=http://rapgenius.com/Queen-pen-i-got-cha-lyrics|work=[[Rap Genius]]|publisher=rapgenius.com|access-date=May 16, 2013}}</ref> Although Pen insisted the song was not about Brown, she responded in an MTV interview: "You make a record about me, I make a record about you.
