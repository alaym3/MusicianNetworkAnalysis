== History ==

=== Formation and early years (2013–2016) ===
The Academic were formed in 2013, when Fitzgerald, Gavin and the Murtagh brothers were attending St Joseph's Secondary School, [[Rochfortbridge]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=The Academic sign with Capitol Records|url=https://www.westmeathexaminer.ie/2020/05/05/the-academic-sign-with-capitol-records/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=5 May 2020|access-date=4 June 2020|website=[[Westmeath Examiner]]|language=en-US}}</ref> 

Such was the reaction to the release of their debut [[Extended play|EP]], ''Loose Friends'', in October 2015, that the band sold out their first show at Dublin venue [[Vicar Street]]. 

In January 2016, the band were selected by [[RTÉ 2fm|RTÉ 2FM]] to represent Ireland at [[Eurosonic Noorderslag]] in [[Groningen]], which resulted in numerous festival bookings and extensive radio airplay across Europe that year. 

=== ''Tales from the Backseat'' (2017–2019) ===
The band garnered further media interest in July 2017 with the release of "Bear Claws", an anthemic track which was likened in style to [[The Strokes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/the-academic-bear-claws-video-premiere-now-hear-this-album-tour-dates-tickets-a7931776.html|title=New music to listen to this week: The Academic|last=O'Connor|first=Roisin|date=6 September 2017|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=8 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/music/the-academic-bear-claws-premiere/|title=Premiere: The Academic's 'Bear Claws' Is Anthemic With An Indie Edge|last=Rossignol|first=Derrick|date=6 July 2017|work=[[Uproxx]]|accessdate=8 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://clashmusic.com/news/premiere-the-academic-bear-claws|title=Premiere: The Academic – 'Bear Claws' |last=Murray|first=Robin|date=7 July 2017|work=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]|accessdate=8 November 2017}}</ref> The track received further attention after the premiere of their first-of-a-kind [[Live looping|live looper]] music video. The video, which was performed live on a [[Facebook]] video stream, utilized the delay in the stream to create a musical loop, to which they gradually added vocals and instruments. It was a viral hit and reached over 1 million views on YouTube in 48 hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2017/10/10/the-academic-facebook-live-delay-explainer/|title=Here's how a band used Facebook Live's delay to create a one-of-a-kind song|last=Koerber|first=Brian|date=10 October 2017|work=[[Mashable]]|accessdate=8 November 2017}}</ref>
