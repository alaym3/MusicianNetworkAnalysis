He attended [[New Rochelle High School]] in [[New Rochelle, New York]], and graduated in 1967. Menken remembers: "I'd make up my own [[Bach]] fugues and [[Beethoven]] sonatas because I was bored with the piano and I didn't want to practice; so I'd go off on tangents".<ref name=klein>{{cite news|first=Alvin|last=Klein|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/27/nyregion/theater-composer-finds-his-niche-in-life.html|title=Theater: Composer Finds His Niche in Life|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 27, 1986|access-date=February 19, 2016}}</ref> He then enrolled at [[New York University]].<ref name=bionyt>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/102519/Alan-Menken/biography|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101205216/http://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/102519/Alan-Menken/biography|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 1, 2015|department=Movies & TV Dept.|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Sandra Brennan|date=2015|title=Alan Menken biography|access-date=February 19, 2016}}</ref> He graduated with a degree in Musicology in 1971 from the university's [[Steinhardt School]].

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
After graduating, Menken's plan was to become either a rock star or a recording artist. His interest in writing musicals increased when he joined the Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) Musical Theatre Workshop and was mentored by [[Lehman Engel]].<ref name=bmi/> From 1974 to 1978, he showcased various BMI workshop works, such as ''Midnight'', ''Apartment House'' (lyric by Muriel Robinson), ''Conversations with Pierre'',<ref name=bmi/>'' Harry the Rat'' and ''Messiah on Mott Street'' (lyrics by [[David Zippel]]).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

According to Menken, during this period, he "worked as a ballet and modern dance accompanist, a musical director for club acts, a [[jingle]] writer, arranger, a songwriter for ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and a vocal coach". He performed his material at clubs like The Ballroom, Reno Sweeny and Tramps.<ref>[http://www.alanmenken.com/m/biography/ "Biography, 1972-1980"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191227150242/http://www.alanmenken.com/m/biography/ |date=2019-12-27 }}, Alanmenken.com, accessed February 19, 2016</ref>

In 1976, John Wilson reported for ''[[The New York Times]]'' that members of Engel's BMI Workshop began performing as part of the "Broadway at the Ballroom" series: "The opening workshop program ... featured Maury Yeston and Alan Menken, both playing their piano accompaniment and singing songs they have written for potential musicals."<ref>{{cite news|first=John S.|last=Wilson|title=Someday, Maybe on Broadway, But for Now They Are in SoHo|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 13, 1976|page=33}}</ref> Wilson reviewed a performance at the Ballroom in 1977 where Menken accompanied a singer: "In the current cabaret world, a piano accompanist is no longer expected to merely play piano for a singer. More and more, pianists can be heard joining in vocally, harmonizing with the singer, creating a background of shouts and exclamations or even doing brief passages of solo singing."<ref>{{cite news|first=John S.|last=Wilson|title=Menken and Ellen March Play|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 3, 1977|page=71}}</ref>
