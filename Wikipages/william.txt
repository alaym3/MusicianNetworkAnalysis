{{wiktionary|William}}
'''William''' is a [[male]] given name of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] origin.<ref name="Oxford">Hanks, Hardcastle and Hodges, ''Oxford Dictionary of First Names'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2nd edition, {{ISBN|978-0-19-861060-1}}, p. 276.</ref> It became very popular in the [[English language]] after the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066,<ref name="allthingswilliam">All Things William, [http://www.allthingswilliam.com/willynilly/name-origin.html "Meaning & Origin of the Name"]</ref> and remained so throughout the Middle Ages and into the modern era. It is sometimes abbreviated "Wm."  Shortened familiar versions in English include [[Will (given name)|Will]], [[Willy]], [[Willie]], [[Bill (given name)|Bill]], and [[Billy (name)|Billy]]. A common [[Irish people|Irish]] form is [[Liam]]. [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[diminutives]] include [[Wull]], [[Willie]] or [[Wullie]] (see [[Oor Wullie]] or [[Douglas (play)#Theme and response|Douglas]] for example). Female forms are Willa, [[Willemina]], Willamette, [[Wilma (given name)|Wilma]] and [[Wilhelmina (given name)|Wilhelmina]].

==Etymology==
'''William''' is related to the given name ''Wilhelm'' (cf. [[Proto-Germanic]] ᚹᛁᛚᛃᚨᚺᛖᛚᛗᚨᛉ, ''*Wiljahelmaz'' > German ''[[Wilhelm (name)|Wilhelm]]'' and [[Old Norse]] ᚢᛁᛚᛋᛅᚼᛅᛚᛘᛅᛋ, ''Vilhjálmr''). By regular sound changes, the native, inherited English form of the name should be ''*Wilhelm'' as well (although the name is not actually attested in the history of English, and the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] refers to [[William the Conqueror]] as ''Willelm'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldenglishaerobics.net/william.html|title=William the Conqueror|author=Peter S. Baker|work=oldenglishaerobics.net}}</ref> That is a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] of two distinct elements: ''wil''&nbsp;=&nbsp;"will or desire"; ''helm''; Old English ''helm'' "helmet, protection";<ref name="Oxford"/> English ''helm'' "knight's large helmet".

In fact, the form ''William'' is clearly identified as typical of the [[Norman language|Old Norman]] form ''Williame, Willame'', because first, the English language should have retained ''(h)elm'' (see common words ''helm, helmet''), second, ''-iaume'' [iaʷm] (typical of Popular French, see [[Guillaume (given name)|Guillaume]]) turned to ''-iame'' [iam] (typical of some Norman and Picard dialects) > English ''-iam''. Historically, there was first a [[triphthong]]ation of ''-elm'' (early Gallo-Romance form <small>WILLELMU</small>) into [iaʷ] + [m] in Old Norman-French, quite similar in Old Central French [eaʷ] + [m]. Then, the [[triphthong]] ''-iau'' was submitted to a monophthongation localized on the second part of the triphthong áu > āò > ā. For instance, this development can be followed in the different versions of the name in the [[Wace]]'s ''[[Roman de Rou]]''.<ref>René Lepelley, {{lang|fr|Guillaume le duc, Guillaume le rois: extraits du Roman de Rou de Wace}}, {{lang|fr|Centre de Publications de l'Université de Caen|italic=no}}, 1987, pp. 16–17.</ref> or in the [[Cauchois dialect|Cauchois]] variant forms of common words such as ''osias'' (plural of ''osè'' "bird", older ''oisel'') / Regular Norman ''oisiaus'' "birds" (French sing. ''oiseau'', pl. ''oiseaux'').

The spelling and phonetics ''Wi-'' [wi] is a characteristic trait of the Northern French dialects, but the pronunciation changed in Norman from [wi] to [vi] in the 12th century (cf. the Norman surnames ''[[Villon (surname)|Villon]]'' and ''Villamaux'' "little William"), unlike the Central French and Southern Norman that turned the Germanic ''Wi-'' into ''Gui-'' [gwi] > [gi]. The Modern French spelling is {{lang|fr|[[Guillaume (given name)|Guillaume]]}}.<ref>{{lang|fr|Lepelley}}, pp. 15–17.</ref>

The first well-known carrier of the name was [[Charlemagne]]'s cousin [[William of Gellone]], a.k.a. Guilhem, William of Orange, Guillaume Fierabrace, or William Short-Nose (755–812). This William is immortalized in the [[Chanson de Guillaume]] and his esteem may account for the name's subsequent popularity among European nobility.

==English history==

The English "William" is taken from the [[Anglo-Norman language]] and was transmitted to England after the Norman conquest in the 11th century, and soon became the most popular name in England{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}, along with other Norman names such as [[Robert]] (the English cognate was [[wikt:Hreodbeorht#Old English|Hrēodbeorht]], which by regular sound changes would have developed into something along the lines of "Reedbart"<ref>this coming from a ''[[Middle English]]'' pronunciation of [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA:]] /rɛːdbɛ:r(x)t/→/rɛːdbɛɾt/→/ɾɛːdbaɾt/→/re:dbäɾt/, and finally, via the great vowel shift, {{IPAc-en|r|i:|d|b|a:r|t}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/edgarbook/names/r/robert.html|title=Edgar's Name Pages, Robert|work=Edgar's Name Pages|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040628090029/http://www.geocities.com/edgarbook/names/r/robert.html|archive-date=2004-06-28}}</ref>){{Better source needed|date=March 2021}}, [[Richard]], [[Roger]] (the English cognate was [[Hroðgar]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthename.com/name/roger|title=Behind the Name: Meaning, Origin and History of the Name Roger|author=Mike Campbell|work=Behind the Name}}</ref>), [[Henry (surname)|Henry]](all of possible Germanic origin and may have been transmitted through the Normans' use of [[Old French]]).

The name 'Wilkin' is also of medieval origin taken from the shortened version of William (Will) with the suffix "kin" added.<ref>An Etymological Dictionary of Family and Christian Names With an Essay on their Derivation and Import; Arthur, William, M.A.; New York, NY: Sheldon, Blake, Bleeker & CO., 1857; pg. 266.</ref>{{Better source needed|date=April 2017}}
