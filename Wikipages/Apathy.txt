'''Apathy''' is a lack of feeling, emotion, interest, or concern about something. It is a state of indifference, or the suppression of emotions such as [[Worry|concern]], [[Psychomotor agitation|excitement]], [[motivation]], or [[Passion (emotion)|passion]]. An apathetic individual has an absence of interest in or concern about emotional, social, spiritual, philosophical, virtual, or physical life and the world. Apathy can also be defined as a person's lack of [[goal orientation]].<ref name = "Fahed_2021">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fahed M, Steffens DC | title = Apathy: Neurobiology, Assessment and Treatment | journal = Clinical Psychopharmacology and Neuroscience | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 181–189 | date = May 2021 | pmid = 33888648 | pmc = 8077060 | doi = 10.9758/cpn.2021.19.2.181 }}</ref>

The apathetic may lack a sense of purpose, worth, or [[Positive psychology#The meaningful life|meaning in their life]]. People that suffer from severe apathy tend to have a lower quality of life and are at a higher risk for mortality and early [[Involuntary commitment|institutionalization]].<ref name = "Fahed_2021" /> They may also exhibit insensibility or [[sluggishness]]. In [[positive psychology]], apathy is described as a result of the individuals' feeling they do not possess the level of skill required to confront a challenge (i.e. "[[Flow (psychology)|flow]]"). It may also be a result of perceiving no challenge at all (e.g. the challenge is irrelevant to them, or conversely, they have [[learned helplessness]]). Apathy is something that all people face in some capacity and is a natural response to disappointment, dejection, and stress. As a response, apathy is a way to forget about these negative feelings.<ref>{{Cite web

An extreme form of apathy may be someone being numb to different stressful life events such as losing a job.

Apathy should be distinguished from [[reduced affect display]], which refers to reduced [[Affect display|emotional expression]] but not necessarily reduced emotion.

Pathological apathy, characterized by extreme forms of apathy, is now known to occur in many different brain disorders,<ref name=HusainRoiser2018>{{cite journal | vauthors = Husain M, Roiser JP | title = Neuroscience of apathy and anhedonia: a transdiagnostic approach | journal = Nature Reviews.

==Etymology==
Although the word ''apathy'' was first used in 1594<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/apathy |title=Apathy - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |access-date=25 February 2014}}</ref> and is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀπάθεια}} (''[[apatheia]]''), from {{lang|grc|ἀπάθης}} (''apathēs'', "without feeling" from ''a-'' ("without, not") and ''[[pathos]]'' ("emotion")),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da)pa%2Fqeia |title=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, ἀπάθ-εια |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |access-date=25 February 2014}}</ref> it is important not to confuse the two terms.  Also meaning "absence of passion," "apathy" or "insensibility" in Greek, the term ''apatheia'' was used by the [[Stoics]] to signify a (desirable) state of indifference towards events and things which lie outside one's control (that is, according to their philosophy, all things exterior, one being only responsible for one's own representations and judgments).<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Fleming W | orig-date = 1857 | title = The vocabulary of philosophy, mental, moral, and metaphysical | url =https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_S-MYAAAAYAAJ/page/n63 <!-- quote=Fleming Stoics apathy.--> | page = 34 | publisher = [[Kessinger Publishing]] | date = 2006 | isbn = 978-1-4286-3324-7 }} and in hardcover (2007; {{ISBN|978-0-548-12371-3}}).</ref> In contrast to ''apathy'', ''apatheia'' is considered a [[virtue]], especially in [[Orthodox monasticism]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  In the [[Philokalia]] the word ''dispassion'' is used for ''apatheia'', so as not to confuse it with ''apathy''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

== History and other views ==
[[Christians]] have historically condemned apathy as a deficiency of love and devotion to [[God]] and his works.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://v3.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=G543&t=KJV |title=Greek Lexicon :: G543 (KJV) |publisher=V3.blueletterbible.org |access-date=25 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002220049/http://v3.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=G543&t=KJV |archive-date=2 October 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This interpretation of apathy is also referred to as [[Sloth (deadly sin)|Sloth]] and is listed among the [[Seven Deadly Sins]]. [[Clemens Alexandrinus]] used the term to draw to Christianity [[philosopher]]s who aspired after virtue.

The modern concept of apathy became more well known after [[World War I]], when it was one of the various forms of "[[shell shock]]".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Webb|first=Thomas E F|date=July 2006|title=‘Dottyville’—Craiglockhart War Hospital and shell-shock treatment in the First World War|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1484566/|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|volume=99|issue=7|pages=342–346|issn=0141-0768|pmc=1484566|pmid=16816263}}</ref> Soldiers who lived in the trenches amidst the bombing and machine gun fire, and who saw the battlefields strewn with dead and maimed comrades, developed a sense of disconnected numbness and indifference to normal [[social interaction]] when they returned from combat.

In 1950, US novelist [[John Dos Passos]] wrote: "Apathy is one of the characteristic responses of any living organism when it is subjected to stimuli too intense or too complicated to cope with. The cure for apathy is [[Understanding|comprehension]]."

===Technology===
Apathy is a normal way for humans to cope with stress. Being able to "shrug off" disappointments is considered an important step in moving people forward and driving them to try other activities and achieve new goals. Coping seems to be one of the most important aspects of getting over a tragedy and an apathetic reaction may be expected. With the addition of the handheld device and the screen between people, apathy has also become a common occurrence on the net as users observe others being bullied, slandered, threatened or sent disturbing images. The bystander effect grows to an apathetic level as people lose interest in caring for others who are not in their "circle" and may even participate in their harassment.

=== Social origin ===
There may be other factors contributing to a person's apathy.

Apathy has been socially viewed as worse than things such as hate or anger.  Not caring whatsoever, in the eyes of some, is even worse than having distaste for something.  Author [[Leo Buscaglia]] is quoted as saying "I have a very strong feeling that the opposite of love is not hate-it's apathy.  It's not giving a damn."  [[Helen Keller]] stated that apathy is the "worst of them all" when it comes to the various evils in the world.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors = Keller H | author-link1 = Helen Keller |title=[[Light in My Darkness]] | chapter = Chapter 6 |date=1994 | orig-date = 1927|publisher=Chrysalis Books |location=West Chester, Pa. |isbn=978-0-87785-146-2 | quote = But if we listen to the best men and women everywhere ... they will say that science may have found a cure for most evils; but it has found no remedy for the worst of them all—the apathy of human beings. }}</ref> French social commentator and political thinker [[Charles de Montesquieu]] stated that "the tyranny of a prince in an oligarchy is not so dangerous to the public welfare as the apathy of a citizen in the democracy." As can be seen by these quotes and various others, the social implications of apathy are great.  Many people believe that not caring at all can be worse for society than individuals who are overpowering or hateful.

===In the school system===
{{One source section|date=March 2016}}
Apathy in students, especially those in high school, is a growing problem. It causes teachers to lower standards in order to try to engage their  students.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal| vauthors = Bishop JH |date=January 1989 |title= Perspective: Why the Apathy in American High Schools? |journal=Educational Researcher|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=6–42|doi=10.3102/0013189X018001006|s2cid=145803015|issn=0013-189X}}</ref> Apathy in schools is most easily recognized by students being unmotivated or, quite commonly, being motivated by outside factors. For example, when asked about their motivation for doing well in school, fifty percent of students cited outside sources such as "college acceptance" or "good grades". On the contrary, only fourteen percent cited "gaining an understanding of content knowledge or learning subject material" as their motivation to do well in school. As a result of these outside sources, and not a genuine desire for knowledge, students often do the minimum amount of work necessary to get by in their classes.<ref name=":0" /> This then leads to average grades and test grades but no real grasping of knowledge.<ref name=":0" /> Many students cited that "assignments/content was irrelevant or meaningless" and that this was the cause of their apathetic attitudes toward their schooling. These apathetic attitudes lead to teacher and parent frustration.<ref>{{cite web | vauthors = Sanders J, Ticktin R |url=http://pan.intrasun.tcnj.edu/501/projects/Sanders/inquiry%20project.htm |title=Finding the Root Cause of Student Apathy | quote = Apathy in High School Students: An Examination Into Causes and A Suggested Plan for Change |publisher=Pan.intrasun.tcnj.edu |access-date=25 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324024245/http://pan.intrasun.tcnj.edu/501/projects/Sanders/inquiry%20project.htm |archive-date=24 March 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Other causes of apathy in students include situations within their home life, media influences, peer influences, and school struggles and failures. Some of the signs for apathetic students include declining grades, skipping classes, routine illness, and behavioral changes both in school and at home. In order to combat this lack of apathy, teachers have to be aware that several students have different motivation profiles.'''<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Korpershoek|first=Hanke|last2=Kuyper|first2=Hans|last3=van der Werf|first3=Greetje|date=2015-03-01|title=Differences in students’ school motivation: A latent class modelling approach|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s11218-014-9274-6|journal=Social Psychology of Education|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=137–163|doi=10.1007/s11218-014-9274-6|issn=1573-1928}}</ref>''' Motivation profiles as in they are motivated by different factors or stimuli.

===Bystander===
Also known as the [[bystander effect]], bystander apathy occurs when, during an emergency, those standing by do nothing to help but instead stand by and watch.  Sometimes this can be caused by one bystander observing other bystanders and imitating their behavior. If other people are not acting in a way that makes the situation seem like an emergency that needs attention, often other bystanders will act in the same way.<ref name="Latané_1969" /> The diffusion to responsibility can also be to blame for bystander apathy.  The more people that are around in emergency situations, the more likely individuals are to think that someone else will help so they do not need to. This theory was popularized by social psychologists in response to the 1964 [[Kitty Genovese]] murder. The murder took place in New York and the victim, Genovese, was stabbed to death as bystanders reportedly stood by and did nothing to stop the situation or even call the police.<ref name="Latané_1969">{{cite journal | vauthors = Latané B, Darley JM | title = Bystanders "apathy" | journal = American Scientist | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 244–68 | date = 1969 | pmid = 5797312 | doi = | url = http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/bystander-effect |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://archive.today/20131104200127/http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/bystander-effect |archive-date=4 November 2013 }}</ref> [[Bibb Latané|Latane]] and [[John M. Darley|Darley]] are the two psychologists who did research on this theory.  They performed different experiments that placed people into situations where they had the opportunity to intervene or do nothing. The individuals in the experiment were either by themselves, with a stranger(s), with a friend, or with a confederate. The experiments ultimately led them to the conclusion that there are many social and situational factors that are behind whether a person will react in an emergency situation or simply remain apathetic to what is occurring.

===Communication===
Apathy is one psychological barrier to [[communication]]. An apathetic listener creates a communication barrier by not caring or paying attention to what they are being told. An apathetic speaker, on the other hand, tends to not relate information well and, in their lack of interest, may leave out key pieces of information that need to be communicated. Within groups, an apathetic communicator can be detrimental. Their lack of interest or passion can inhibit the other group members in what they are trying to accomplish. Within [[interpersonal communication]], an apathetic listener can make the other feel that they are not cared for or about. Overall, apathy is a dangerous barrier to successful communication.  Apathetic speakers and listeners are individuals that have no care for what they are trying to communicate, or what is being communicated to them.

==Measurement of Apathy==
Several different questionnaires and clinical interview instruments have been used to measure pathological apathy or, more recently, apathy in healthy people.

===Apathy Evaluation Scale===
Developed by Robert Marin in 1991, the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) was the first method developed to measure apathy in clinical populations. Centered around evaluation, the scale can either be self-informed or other-informed. The three versions of the test include self, informant such as a family member, and clinician. The scale is based around questionnaires that ask about topics including interest, motivation, socialization, and how the individual spends their time. The individual or informant answers on a scale of "not at all", "slightly", "somewhat" or "a lot". Each item on the evaluation is created with positive or negative syntax and deals with cognition, behavior, and emotion.  Each item is then scored and, based on the score, the individual's level of apathy can be evaluated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dementia-assessment.com.au/symptoms/AES_self.pdf |title=Apathy Evaluation Scale (Self rated) |publisher=Dementia-assessment.com.au |access-date=25 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140126074628/http://dementia-assessment.com.au/symptoms/AES_self.pdf |archive-date=26 January 2014 }}</ref>

===Apathy Motivation Index===

The Apathy Motivation Index (AMI) was developed to measure different dimensions of apathy in healthy people. Factor analysis identified three distinct axes of apathy: behavioural, social and emotional.<ref name="Ang et al PLoS One">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ang YS, Lockwood P, Apps MA, Muhammed K, Husain M | title = Distinct Subtypes of Apathy Revealed by the Apathy Motivation Index | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = e0169938 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28076387 | pmc = 5226790 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0169938 | bibcode = 2017PLoSO..1269938A | doi-access = free }}</ref> The AMI has since been used to examine apathy in patients with [[Parkinson's disease]] who, overall, showed evidence of behavioural and social apathy, but not emotional apathy.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ang YS, Lockwood PL, Kienast A, Plant O, Drew D, Slavkova E, Tamm M, Husain M | display-authors = 6 | title = Differential impact of behavioral, social, and emotional apathy on Parkinson's disease | journal = Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | pages = 1286–1291 | date = October 2018 | pmid = 30349863 | pmc = 6186939 | doi = 10.1002/acn3.626 }}</ref>

===Dimensional Apathy Scale===
The Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS) is a multidimensional apathy instrument for measuring subtypes of apathy in different clinical populations and healthy adults. It was developed using factor analysis, quantifying Executive apathy (lack of motivation for planning, organising and attention), Emotional apathy (emotional indifference, neutrality, flatness or blunting) and Initiation apathy (lack of motivation for self-generation of thought/action). There is a self-rated version of the DAS<ref name="Radakovic & Abrahams Psychiatry Res">{{cite journal | vauthors = Radakovic R, Abrahams S | title = Developing a new apathy measurement scale: Dimensional Apathy Scale | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 219 | issue = 3 | pages = 658–63 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 24972546 | doi = 10.1016/j.psychres.2014.06.010 | s2cid = 16313833 | url = https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/25353052/abrahams_accepted_man_2_.pdf }}</ref> and an informant/carer-rated version of the DAS.<ref name="Radakovic et al JNNP">{{cite journal | vauthors = Radakovic R, Stephenson L, Colville S, Swingler R, Chandran S, Abrahams S | title = Multidimensional apathy in ALS: validation of the Dimensional Apathy Scale | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 87 | issue = 6 | pages = 663–9 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 26203157 | doi = 10.1136/jnnp-2015-310772 | s2cid = 15540782 | url = https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/65877/1/Accepted_manuscript.pdf }}</ref> Further a clinical brief DAS has also been developed.<ref name="Radakovic et al TCN">{{cite journal | vauthors = Radakovic R, Stephenson L, Colville S, Swingler R, Chandran S, Abrahams S | title = Multidimensional apathy in ALS: validation of the Dimensional Apathy Scale | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 87 | issue = 6 | pages = 663–9 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 26203157 | doi = 10.1080/13854046.2019.1621382 | s2cid = 173994534 | url = https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/71489/1/TCNPURE.pdf }}</ref> It has been validated for use in motor neurone disease, dementia and Parkinson's disease, showing to differentiate profiles of apathy subtypes between these conditions<ref name="Radakovic & Abrahams Curr Opin Behav Sci">{{cite journal | vauthors = Radakovic R, Abrahams S |title=Multidimensional apathy: evidence from neurodegenerative disease |journal=Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences |date=2018 |volume=22 |pages=42–49 |doi=10.1016/j.cobeha.2017.12.022 |s2cid=53173573 |url= https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/66281/1/Accepted_manuscript.pdf }}</ref>

===Depression===
{{Main|Major depressive disorder}}
Mental health journalist and author John McManamy argues that although [[psychiatrist]]s do not explicitly deal with the condition of apathy, it is a psychological problem for some [[clinical depression|depressed]] people, in which they get a sense that "nothing matters", the "lack of will to go on and the inability to care about the consequences".<ref name="McManamy">{{cite web | vauthors = McManamy J | url = http://www.mcmanweb.com/apathy.html | title = Apathy Matters - Apathy and Depression: Psychiatry may not care about apathy, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140820171536/http://www.mcmanweb.com/apathy.html | archive-date=20 August 2014 }}".{{self-published inline|date=March 2020}}</ref> He describes depressed people who "...cannot seem to make [themselves] do anything", who "can't complete anything", and who do not "feel any excitement about seeing loved ones".<ref name="McManamy" /> He acknowledges that the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' does not discuss apathy.

In a ''[[Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences]]'' article from 1991, Robert Marin, MD, claimed that pathological apathy occurs due to brain damage or neuropsychiatric illnesses such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's disease, or stroke. Marin argues that apathy is a syndrome associated with many different brain disorders.<ref name="McManamy" /> This has now been shown to be the case across a range of neurological and psychiatric conditions.<ref name="HusainRoiser2018" />

A review article by Robert van Reekum, MD, et al. from the [[University of Toronto]] in the ''Journal of Neuropsychiatry'' (2005) claimed that an obvious relationship between depression and apathy exists in some populations.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = van Reekum R, Stuss DT, Ostrander L | title = Apathy: why care? | journal = The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–19 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15746478 | doi = 10.1176/jnp.17.1.7 }}</ref> However, although many patients with depression suffer from apathy, several studies have shown that apathy can occur independently of depression, and vice versa.<ref name=HusainRoiser2018 />

Depending upon how it has been measured, apathy affects 19–88% percent of individuals with [[Alzheimer's disease]] (mean prevalence of 49% across different studies).<ref name="NobisHusainAD" /> It is a neuropsychiatric symptom associated with functional impairment.

===Anxiety===
While apathy and [[anxiety]] may appear to be separate, and different, states of being, there are many ways that severe anxiety can cause apathy.  First, the emotional fatigue that so often accompanies severe anxiety leads to one's emotions being worn out, thus leading to apathy.  Second, the low serotonin levels associated with anxiety often lead to less passion and interest in the activities in one's life which can be seen as apathy.  Third, negative thinking and distractions associated with anxiety can ultimately lead to a decrease in one's overall happiness which can then lead to an apathetic outlook about one's life.  Finally, the difficulty enjoying activities that individuals with anxiety often face can lead to them doing these activities much less often and can give them a sense of apathy about their lives.  Even behavioral apathy may be found in individuals with anxiety in the form of them not wanting to make efforts to treat their anxiety.<ref>{{cite web | vauthors = Abraham M | date = 10 October 2020 |url= http://www.calmclinic.com/anxiety/apathy |title=Apathy: Anxiety's Unusual Symptom |publisher=Calm Clinic |access-date=25 February 2014}}</ref>
