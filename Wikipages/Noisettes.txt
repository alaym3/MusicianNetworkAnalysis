''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. (851):101</ref>  In a March 2006 article on UK bands, ''[[USA Today]]'' said, "The incendiary Shingai Shoniwa leads this London blues-punk band, known for its feral and explosive live show."<ref>Gundersen, Edna (24 March 2006), "Elbow your way into 12 others, for maximo effect."
