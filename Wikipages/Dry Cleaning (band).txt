==History==
===Formation===
Guitarist Tom Dowse met vocalist Florence Shaw around 2010 at the [[Royal College of Art]] where they both were students, and quickly became friends. Dowse described Shaw as “ [...] fiercely intelligent, very emotionally sophisticated.” Adding “Meeting her was like finding a kindred spirit.”

Dowse was an experienced musician at that time and had played in numerous bands. After finishing school, he had trouble finding jobs, but in 2017 he got back in touch with Shaw, and asked her to check out some demos he had recorded with mutual friends, Lewis Maynard and Nick Buxton. Dowse, wanted Shaw to be the front woman but she declined at first, saying: “I was immediately like, ‘No way. I can’t imagine something I need less right now.’ It was a firm no.”

Dowse was determined in getting Shaw into the band, after hearing her voice over the demos. The rest of the band members invited her to one of their rehearsals. Drummer Nick Buxton told Shaw she could just talk instead of sing and gave her a playlist that included [[Grace Jones]]' ''[[Private Life (song)|Private Life]]'' and other similar tracks. She finally accepted and went into rehearsal with “writing from my old drawings, stuff I’d written on my phone, diaries, things I’d seen in adverts and thought were funny” — and read aloud as the other three played their instruments around her. She recalls this moment “like when you see those cheesy films about bands, and they’re writing the hit, and there’s a magic moment.”<ref name="RollingStone">{{cite web |last1=Vozick-Levinson |first1=Simon|title=The Everyday Poetry of Dry Cleaning  |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/dry-cleaning-band-interview-london-1139020/ |website=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=17 March 2021  |access-date=18 August 2021}}</ref>

===''Magic of Meghan'' and debut album===
The band released their debut single, "Magic of Meghan" in 2019. Shaw wrote the song after going through a break-up and moving out of her former partner's apartment the same day that [[Meghan, Duchess of Sussex|Meghan Markle]] and [[Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex|Prince Harry]] announced they were [[Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle|engaged]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jenkins |first1=Carla |title=Who are Dry Cleaning and what is the Meghan Markle connection? |url=https://www.thenational.scot/news/18221720.dry-cleaning-meghan-markle-connection/ |website=The National |access-date=11 February 2021}}</ref> This was followed by the release of two EPs that year: ''Sweet Princess'' in August and ''Boundary Road Snacks and Drinks'' in October.
