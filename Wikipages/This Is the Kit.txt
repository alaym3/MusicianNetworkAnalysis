==Critical attention==
This Is The Kit were a long-time favourite among various [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] DJs, which is where the musician and presenter [[Guy Garvey]] discovered them, playing their music frequently. Fellow 6 Music DJs [[Lauren Laverne]], [[Radcliffe & Maconie]], [[Cerys Matthews]], and [[Mary Anne Hobbs]] have also been major supporters; DJ [[Marc Riley]] has hosted the band for three BBC live sessions to date.<ref>{{cite web|title=This Is The Kit session for Marc Riley on 6 Music|url=http://viaductpromotions.co.uk/this-is-the-kit-session-for-marc-riley-on-6-music/|accessdate=20 December 2015|publisher=Viaduct promotions}}</ref> [[BBC Radio 1]] has offered the band spot plays via DJs Huw Stephens, Jen & Ally, and Phil Taggart.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

As the band prepared to release their third album ''Bashed Out'' in late 2014 and early 2015, they began to receive more attention from online and print critics. [[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]], [[Drowned in Sound]], [[The Line of Best Fit]] and [[The 405 (website)|The 405]] awarded the album 8/10 ratings. [[The Mancunion]] rated a live show a 9/10.<ref name="The Mancunion">{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Jacob|title=Live: This Is The Kit|url=http://mancunion.com/2015/03/27/live-this-is-the-kit/|accessdate=7 August 2015|publisher=The Mancunion}}</ref> Finally, the American blog [[Stereogum]] wrote that "Kate Stables has been recording music as This Is The Kit for years now, but this is probably one of the first times you’re reading about her. "Bashed Out" will be her third full-length album, and…it will also likely be her breakout."<ref name="Stereogum">{{cite web|last=White|first=Caitlin|title=This Is The Kit – Bashed Out (Stereogum Premiere)|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1734238/this-is-the-kit-bashed-out-stereogum-premiere/mp3s/|accessdate=7 August 2015|website=Stereogum.com}}</ref>

The band received a boost in attention in August 2015 when [[BBC iPlayer]] debuted an episode of the documentary series ''Music Box'' devoted to This Is The Kit's music and influences.<ref name="Guy Garvey's Music Box">{{cite web|last=Garvey|first=Guy|title=From PJ Harvey to This Is The Kit|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p02ycs9g/music-box-with-guy-garvey-from-pj-harvey-to-this-is-the-kit|work=Guy Garvey's Music Box|publisher=BBC|accessdate=7 August 2015}}</ref> The show was hosted by Garvey, who argued that their second album, ''Wriggle Out the Restless'', deserved a Mercury Prize nomination.<ref>{{cite web|title=This is the Kit|url=http://www.latitudefestival.com/line-up/artist/kit|publisher=Latitudefestival.com|accessdate=20 December 2015}}</ref>

The band also appeared in the [[BBC One]] television series ''[[Wanderlust (UK TV series)|Wanderlust]]'', playing in a night club that [[Toni Collette|Toni Colette's]] character Joy attended.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt7608238/fullcredits|title=Wanderlust (TV Series 2018– ) |website=IMDb.com|accessdate=23 October 2020}}</ref>

==Recording history==
In 2006, record label [[Sunday Best (music company)|Sunday Best Recordings]] included the band's song "Two Wooden Spoons" in its ''[[Folk Off]]'' [[compilation album]] alongside artists including [[Animal Collective]], [[Tunng]] and [[Vashti Bunyan]]. Their song was noted as a standout with [[Drowned in Sound]] stating: "its personal touch is largely what makes This Is The Kit the British highlight, not to mention that of the compilation as a whole".<ref name="Folk-Off review">{{cite web|last=Marwood|first=Ben|title=Folk-Off Review|url=http://drownedinsound.com/releases/7621/reviews/982725-|work=Drowned in Sound|publisher=drowned in sound|accessdate=20 December 2012|archive-date=12 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112111255/http://drownedinsound.com/releases/7621/reviews/982725-|url-status=dead}}</ref> Following that, Sunday Best went on to release "Two Wooden Spoons" as a 7" single with the B side "Come a Cropper" in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|title=This is the Kit|url=http://www.artisttrove.com/artist/120238271382143/This+Is+the+Kit|publisher=Artist Trove|accessdate=20 December 2015}}</ref>
