'''Nikolija Jovanović''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Николија Јовановић}}, born on 19 October 1989) is a [[Serbia]]n recording artist, model and businesswoman. Daughter of singer [[Vesna Zmijanac]], she was born in [[Zagreb]] and raised in [[Belgrade]]. Nikolija rose to prominence by appearing on the reality show ''[[Survivor Srbija VIP: Philippines]]'' as well as for being a [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] fixture, before pursuing a music career in 2013 with her single "[[Ćao zdravo]]". Her debut album, ''[[No1 (Nikolija album)|№1]]'', was released in October 2016 featuring commercially successful singles such as "Alkohola litar", "Kako posle mene" (2014) and "[[Opasna igra (song)|Opasna igra]]" (2015), which encapsulated her signature mixture of [[urban contemporary|urban-pop]] and [[turbo-folk|pop-folk]] music. Following several other standalone singles, her second album, ''[[Yin & Yang (album)|Yin & Yang]]'', was released in April 2019.

Since 2014, Nikolija has been in a relationship with musician and actor [[Relja Popović]], with whom she has two daughters.

==Early life==
Jovanović was born on October 19, 1989, in [[Zagreb]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] (today's [[Croatia]]) to [[Vesna Zmijanac]], popular [[Serbian folk music|folk]] singer, and Vlada Jovanović, economist best known for serving as the chief of marketing at [[PGP RTS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nova.rs/zabava/nikolijin-otac/|title=Dali ste znali - Nikolijin otac je doktor nauka|date=6 January 2020|website=[[Nova S|nova.rs]]|language=sr|access-date=6 January 2020|author=A. Kolarević}}</ref> The family moved to [[Belgrade]] when the [[Yugoslav Wars]] had started, where Nikolija was raised. Shortly after she had been born, her parents got divorced and she has two step-siblings from her father's second marriage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://idjtv.com/news/showbizz/5d060d195160cf10edab17b8/mnogi-nisu-znali-da-nikolija-ima-sestru-evo-kako-ona-izgleda|title=Mnogi nisu znali da Nikolija ima sestru, evo kako ona izgleda|date=16 June 2019|website=idjtv.com|language=sr|access-date=18 July 2020|archive-date=31 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201031143727/https://idjtv.com/news/showbizz/5d060d195160cf10edab17b8/mnogi-nisu-znali-da-nikolija-ima-sestru-evo-kako-ona-izgleda|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1995, Nikolija starred in her mother's music video for the song "Kad bih znala kako si". She said that in middle school she won the town's singing competition with her performance of ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'s'' "[[A Whole New World]]". However, Jovanović also stated that as a child she didn't desire to become a singer due to the experience of having a famous singer mother. She cites mainly [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] artists, like [[2Pac]], [[Eminem]], [[50 Cent]], [[Beyoncé]] and [[Christina Aguilera]], as those she listened to growing up.

For her senior year of high school, Nikolija moved to [[Athens]], [[Greece]] were she later began attending The School of Business & Economics at the American [[Deree College]], from which she graduated in 2013 with a degree in international business.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hellomagazin.rs/moda/modne-vesti/nikolija-jovanovic-moj-otac-nije-bio-odusevljen-zanimanjem-koje-sam-izabrala/|title=Nikolija Jovanović: moj otac nije bio oduševljen zanimanjem koje sam izabrala|access-date=29 May 2014|publisher=Hello magazin|language=sr|archive-date=15 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715163535/http://www.hellomagazin.rs/moda/modne-vesti/nikolija-jovanovic-moj-otac-nije-bio-odusevljen-zanimanjem-koje-sam-izabrala/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Career==
===Music===
During her studies in Greece, she started performing in night clubs as a dancer and [[master of ceremonies|MC]], claiming to have worked alongside acts such as [[Tiësto]], [[Armin van Buuren]], [[Paul van Dyk]] and [[Swedish House Mafia]]. In 2011, Nikolija also released her first song as Nicole, titled "Crazy 2 Night", but failed to make significant success.

After relocating back to Serbia in 2013, she decided to pursue a recording career there by releasing her [[house rap]] single "[[Ćao zdravo]]" in April through IDJTunes.<ref name="Ćao, Zdravo iTunes">{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/ćao-zdravo-feat-teca-single/1118081874|title=Ćao, Zdravo (feat.
