'''The Hues Corporation''' was an American [[pop music|pop]] and [[soul music|soul]] [[trio (music)|trio]], formed in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], [[California]] in 1969. They are best known for their 1974 single "[[Rock the Boat (The Hues Corporation song)|Rock the Boat]]", which sold over 2 million copies.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web|author=Ron Wynn|title=Hues Corporation - Biography - AllMusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/hues-corporation-mn0000280151/biography|work=AllMusic|accessdate=20 December 2014}}</ref>

==Group name and background==
Before achieving mainstream success they were the opening act for a list of headliners that included [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Milton Berle]], [[Nancy Sinatra]], and [[Glen Campbell]]. The original band had a lineup of three singers and three sidemen. The sidemen were Joey Rivera from the Checkmates; Monti Lawston; and Bob "Bullet" Bailey, formerly of the Leaves. Bailey, Rivera, and Lawston left the band to form Goodstuff.

The group's name was a [[pun]] on the [[Howard Hughes Corporation]], with the 'hue' (a synonym of '[[color]]'). The band's members at the time of their first album were St. Clair Lee (born Bernard St. Clair Lee, April 24, 1944, [[San Francisco]], California; died March 8, 2011), Fleming Williams (born December 26, 1943, [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], [[Michigan]]; died February 15, 1998)<ref name="Discomusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.discomusic.com/people-more/1661_0_11_0_C/|title=Fleming Williams|work=DiscoMusic.com|accessdate=20 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130121124507/http://www.discomusic.com/people-more/1661_0_11_0_C/|archivedate=21 January 2013}}</ref> and Hubert Ann Kelley (born April 24, 1947, [[Fairfield, Alabama|Fairfield]], [[Alabama]]).<ref>[https://archive.today/20120913151701/http://www.tunegenie.com/bio/MN0000280151/the-hues-corporation/?b=wtcb More Hues Corporation info]</ref> The original choice for the group's name was The Children of [[Howard Hughes]], which their [[record label]] turned down.

==Career==

The group was formed in 1969.<ref name="Page 127 Hues Corporation">Rhythm and Blues, Rap, and Hip-hop by Frank Hoffmann [https://books.google.com/books?id=wNfx07-AJwcC&pg=PA127&lpg=PA127&dq=Hues+Corporation+1969+first+single&source=bl&ots=picLJSvRiD&sig=FZrmdJZcUwyXOrR2d0iW4tBdtE4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=u2gfVYb4CsXCmQWlp4HIBw&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=Hues%20Corporation%201969%20first%20single&f=false Page 127 Hues Corporation]</ref> Songwriter [[Waldo Holmes|Wally Holmes]] founded the group with his friend Bernard St. Clair Lee.

Retrieved 12 Juli 2018.</ref> the group's first big break came in 1972, when they were invited to appear in the [[blaxploitation]] [[film]], ''[[Blacula]]'', starring [[William Marshall (film and television actor)|William Marshall]]. They were also asked to record three songs for the film's [[soundtrack]]: "There He Is Again", "What The World Knows," and "I'm Gonna Catch You." After their participation in the ''Blacula''-project Karl Russell was replaced by Fleming Williams and the group signed with [[RCA Records]]; their second [[single (music)|single]] for the label, "Freedom For The Stallion", from the [[album]] of the same name, became a moderate hit, reaching #63 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]]. The third single from the album, "[[Rock the Boat (The Hues Corporation song)|Rock the Boat]]," became a [[record chart|#1]] hit on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' chart and the group's [[signature song]]. The bass player on the session for "Rock the Boat" was Wilton Felder, not [[James Jamerson]] as previously reported. "Rock the Boat" was [[songwriter|written]] by Holmes, who also wrote the Blacula songs, and was released in the [[United States|U.S.]] in February 1974 and in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in July of that year.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

Some authorities proclaim it to be the first disco song to hit #1, while others give that distinction to "[[Love's Theme]]" by [[the Love Unlimited Orchestra]], a chart-topper from earlier in 1974.

After the success of "Rock the Boat," the Hues Corporation's other charted singles on the Billboard Hot 100 included "Rockin' Soul" (1974, #18), "Love Corporation" (1975, #62), and "I Caught Your Act" (1977, #92).

The group was unable to duplicate the success of their earlier hits and disbanded sometime around 1980. Whereas some sources claim the year of disbanding as early as 1978, archive footage of a television special for the Chilean TV in 1979 promoting their performance at the [[Viña del Mar International Song Festival]] proves the opposite.<ref name="Chile">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM0Cv7UpC0k The Hues Corporation en Chile, especial de UC-TV 1979].
