'''Zion''' ({{lang-he|צִיּוֹן}} ''Ṣīyyōn'', <small>[[LXX]]</small> {{lang|grc|Σιών}}, also variously [[Romanization of Hebrew|transliterated]] ''Sion'',<ref>''Sion'' is the spelling in the [[Vulgate]], also adopted in modern French.</ref> ''Tzion'', ''Tsion'', ''Tsiyyon''<ref>Hebrew Academy 2006 convention for the romanization of Hebrew, [http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/hahlatot/TheTranscription/Documents/LAT-HEB.pdf Announcements of the Academy of the Hebrew Language] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015060444/http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/hahlatot/TheTranscription/Documents/LAT-HEB.pdf |date=2013-10-15 }}</ref>) is a placename in the [[Hebrew Bible]] used as a synonym for [[Jerusalem]]<ref name=Longmanp936/><ref name=Brileyp49/> as well as for the [[Land of Israel]] as a whole (see [[Names of Jerusalem]]).

The name is found in [[2 Samuel]] (5:7), one of the books of the Hebrew Bible [[Books of Samuel#Authorship and date of composition|dated to]] before or close to the mid-6th century BC. It originally referred to a specific hill in Jerusalem ([[Mount Zion]]), located to the south of [[Mount Moriah]] (the Temple Mount). According to the narrative of 2 Samuel 5, Mount Zion held the [[Jebusite]] fortress of the same name that was conquered by [[David]] and was renamed the [[City of David (historic)|City of David]]. 
That specific hill ("mount") is one of the many squat hills that form Jerusalem, which also includes Mount Moriah (the Temple Mount), the [[Mount of Olives]], etc. Over many centuries, until as recently as the Ottoman era, the city walls of Jerusalem were rebuilt many times in new locations, so that the particular hill known as Mount Zion is no longer inside the city wall, but its location is now just outside the portion of the Old City wall forming the southern boundary of  the Jewish Quarter of the current Old City. Most of the original City of David itself is thus also outside the current city wall.

The term ''Tzion'' came to designate the area of Davidic Jerusalem where the fortress stood, and was used as well as [[synecdoche]] for the entire city of Jerusalem; and later, when [[Solomon's Temple]] was built on the adjacent Mount Moriah (which, as a result, came to be known as the Temple Mount) the meanings of the term ''Tzion'' were further extended by [[synecdoche]] to the additional meanings of the Temple itself, the hill upon which the Temple stood, the entire city of Jerusalem, the entire biblical Land of Israel, and "[[Jewish eschatology#The world to come|the World to Come]]", the Jewish understanding of the [[afterlife]].

==Etymology==
The etymology of the word ''Zion'' (''ṣiyôn'') is uncertain.<ref name=Longmanp936>{{cite book|last1=Longman|first1=Tremper|author-link1=Tremper Longman|last2=Enns|first2=Peter|author-link2=Peter Enns|title=Dictionary of the Old Testament: Wisdom, Poetry & Writings: A Compendium of Contemporary Biblical Scholarship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kE2k36XAkv4C&pg=PA936|year=2008|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=978-0-8308-1783-2|page=936}}</ref><ref name=Brileyp49>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Arnold Albert|title=The book of Psalms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eq5gFlzMxQgC|year=1981|publisher=[[Wm.

Mentioned in the Old Testament in the [[Books of Samuel]] (2 Samuel 5:7) as the name of a [[Jebusite]] fortress conquered by [[David]], its origin seems to predates the [[Israelites]].<ref name=Longmanp936/><ref name=Brileyp49/> If [[Semitic languages|Semitic]], it may be derived from the Hebrew root ''ṣiyyôn'' ("castle") or the Hebrew צִיָּה ''ṣiyya'' ("dry land" or "desert", Jeremiah 51:43). A non-Semitic relationship to the [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]] word ''šeya'' ("river" or "brook") has also been suggested<ref name=Bromileyp1006/> as also one of [[Hittite language|Hittite]]<ref name=Mendenhall1973>{{cite book|last=Mendenhall|first=George|title=The Tenth Generation: The Origins of the Biblical Tradition|url=https://archive.org/details/tenthgenerationo0000mend|url-access=registration|publisher=[[The Johns Hopkins University Press]]|year=1973|isbn=0-8018-1654-8}}</ref> origin.

{{anchor|Orthography}}
The form  {{lang|he|ציון}} (''Tzion'', [[Tiberian vocalization]]: ''Ṣiyyôn'') appears 108 times in the [[Hebrew Bible]], and once with article, as ''HaTzion''.<ref>''The Responsa Project: Version 13'', Bar Ilan University, 2005</ref><ref>Kline, D.E., ''A Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the Hebrew Language for readers of English'', Carta Jerusalem, [[University of Haifa]], 1987, pp.XII-XIII</ref>

[[Tsade]] is usually rendered as ''z'' in [[English Bible translations]], hence the spelling ''Zion'' (rather than ''Tzion'').
This convention apparently originates in [[German orthography]],<ref>Joseph Dixon, ''A general introduction to the Sacred Scriptures: in a series of dissertations, critical hermeneutical and historical'', J. Murphy, 1853, p.132</ref> where '''z''' is always pronounced [t͡s]. 
<!--
A '''tz''' would only be used if the preceding vowel is short, hence the use of ''Zion'' in 19th-century German [[Biblical criticism]]. 
 -- 19th-century German has nothing to do with it, as ''Zion'' was well established in the KJV during the 1600s.
If this is from German, it is from 16th-century German
This orthography was adopted because in German, the correct transliteration can only be rendered from the one instance of ''HaTzion'' in Kings II 23:17, where the ''a'' vowel is followed by a double consonant '''tz'''.{{huh}}-->

==Hebrew Bible==
{{anchor|Daughter of Zion}}<!-- This section is linked from [[Uncle Sam]] -->
''Zion'' is mentioned 152 times in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh), most often in the [[Prophetic books]], the [[Book of Psalms]], and the [[Book of Lamentations]], besides  six mentions in the [[Historical books]] (Kings, Samuel, Chronicles)
and a single mention of the "daughters of Zion" in the [[Song of Songs]] (3:11)

Out of the 152 mentions, 26 instances are within the phrase of "Daughter of Zion" (Hebrew "bat Tzion").
This is a personification of the city of Jerusalem, or of its population.<ref>Joseph Addison Alexander, ''Commentary on the Prophecies of Isaiah'' (1878), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=q_hFAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA65  p. 65].</ref>

In [[Psalm 137]], Zion (Jerusalem) is remembered from the perspective of the [[Babylonian Captivity]]. 
"[1] By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion. [2] We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. [3] For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion." In verse 8, the phrase "Daughter of Babylon"
appears as a personification of Babylon or its population: "[8] O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us."

[[Psalm 147]] uses "Jerusalem"  and "Zion" interchangeably to address the faithful: "[2] The Lord doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcast of Israel. [...] [12] Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion."

==Judaism==
The location of the Temple, and in particular its [[Holy of Holies]] (innermost sanctum), is the most holy place in the world for the Jewish people, seen as the connection between [[God in Judaism|God]] and humanity. Observant Jews recite the [[Amidah]] three times a day facing the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, praying for the rebuilding of the Holy Temple, the restoration of the Temple service, the redemption of the world, and for the coming of the [[Messiah in Judaism|Messiah]].

In [[Kabbalah]], the more esoteric reference is made to Tzion being the spiritual point from which reality emerges, located in the [[Holy of Holies]] of the [[Solomon's Temple|First]], [[Second Temple|Second]] and [[Third Temple]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shemayisrael.co.il/parsha/dimension/archives/devarim.htm|title=Parshas HaShavua|work=shemayisrael.co.il}}</ref>

===Zionism===

[[File:Bat Zion I want your Old New Land join Jewish regiment.jpg|thumb|upright| A [[World War I]] recruitment poster. The Daughter of Zion (representing the Hebrew people): "Your [[The Old New Land|Old New Land]] must have you! Join the [[Jewish Legion|Jewish regiment]]."]]

The term "Zionism", coined by Austrian [[Nathan Birnbaum]], was derived from the German rendering of Tzion in his journal ''[[Auto-Emancipation|Selbstemanzipation]]'' ("self emancipation") in 1890.<ref>De Lange, Nicholas, ''An Introduction to Judaism'', [[Cambridge University Press]] (2000), p. 30.  {{ISBN|0-521-46624-5}}.</ref> Zionism as a [[Jewish political movements|modern political movement]] [[First Zionist Congress|started in 1897]] and supported a "[[Jewish homeland|national home]]", and [[Jewish state|later a state]], for the [[Jew]]ish people in the [[Land of Israel]], though the idea has been around since the end of Jewish independent rule. The Zionist movement declared the establishment of the [[State of Israel]] in 1948, following the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]]. Since then, and with varying [[ideologies]], Zionists have focused on developing and protecting this state.

The last line of the Israeli national anthem ''[[Hatikvah]]'' (Hebrew for "The Hope") is "....Eretz Zion, ViYerushalayim", which means literally "The land of Zion and Jerusalem".

==Islamic tradition==
''Ṣahyūn'' ({{lang-ar|صهيون}}, ''Ṣahyūn'' or ''Ṣihyūn'') is the word for Zion in Arabic and [[Syriac language|Syriac]].<ref name=PEFp21>{{cite book|author=Palestine Exploration Fund|author-link=Palestine Exploration Fund|work=[[Palestine Exploration Quarterly]]|title=Palestine Exploration Quarterly, Volumes 109-110|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nodAAQAAIAAJ|year=1977|publisher=Published at the Fund's Office|page=21}}</ref><ref name=Gilp114>{{cite book|last=Gil|first=Moshe|author-link=Moshe Gil|title=A History of Palestine, 634-1099|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M0wUKoMJeccC&pg=PA114|year=1997|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-59984-9|page=114}}</ref> Drawing on biblical tradition, it is one of the names accorded to Jerusalem in Arabic and Islamic tradition.<ref name=Gilp114/><ref name=Freundp141>{{cite book|last=Freund|first=Richard A.|title=Digging Through the Bible: Modern Archaeology and the Ancient Bible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3EWWup0o-o4C&pg=PA141|year=2009|publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]]|isbn=978-0-7425-4645-5|page=141}}</ref> A valley called ''Wādī Sahyũn'' seemingly preserves the name and is located approximately one and three-quarter miles from the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]]'s [[Jaffa Gate]].<ref name=PEFp21/>

For example, the reference to the "precious cornerstone" of the new Jerusalem in the [[Book of Isaiah]] 28:16 is identified in Islamic scholarship as the [[Black Stone]] of the [[Kaaba]].<ref name=Wheelerp89>{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Brannon M.|title=Moses in the Quran and Islamic Exegesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=By7D11xMzlcC&pg=PA89|year=2002|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|isbn=978-0-7007-1603-6|page=89}}</ref> This interpretation is said by [[ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya]] (1292–1350) to have come from the [[People of the Book]], though earlier Christian scholarship identifies the cornerstone with [[Jesus]].<ref name=Wheelerp89/>

==Latter Day Saint==
{{Main|Zion (Latter Day Saints)}}
Within the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], Zion is often used to connote a peaceful ideal society. In the Latter Day Saints belief system the term ''Zion'' is often used to determine a place of gathering for the saints. It is also often used to determine an area or city of refuge for the saints.

==Rastafari movement==
{{Rquote|right|I say fly away home to Zion, fly away home...One bright morning when my work is over, man will fly away home...
|Rastaman Chant|[[Bob Marley and the Wailers]]|}}
In [[Rastafari]], "Zion" stands for a [[utopia]]n place of unity, peace and freedom, as opposed to "[[Babylon]]", the oppressing and exploiting system of the materialistic modern world and a place of evil.<ref name="Oxford University Press">{{cite web|title=Definition of Babylon (chiefly among Rastafari)|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/Babylon--2|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|access-date=22 March 2013}}</ref>

It proclaims Zion, as reference to [[Ethiopia]], the original birthplace of humankind, and from the beginning of the movement calls to [[repatriation]] to Zion, the [[Promised Land]] and Heaven on Earth.<ref>{{cite web|title=What Do Rastafarians Believe|url=http://www.jamaicans.com/culture/rasta/believe.shtml|work=Jamaican Culture|publisher=Jamaicans.com|access-date=22 March 2013|date=2003-05-30}}</ref> Some Rastafari believe themselves to represent the real [[Israelites|Children of Israel]] in modern times, and their goal is to repatriate to Ethiopia, or to Zion. The [[Ge'ez]]-language ''[[Kebra Nagast]]'' serves as inspiration for the idea that the "Glory of Zion" transferred from Jerusalem to Ethiopia in the time of Solomon and Sheba, c. 950 BC.

Rastafari [[reggae]] contains many references to Zion; among the best-known examples are the [[Bob Marley]] songs "Zion Train", "[[Iron Lion Zion]]", the [[Bunny Wailer]] song "Rastaman" ("The Rasta come from Zion, Rastaman a Lion!"), The Melodians song "Rivers of Babylon" (based on Psalm 137, where the captivity of ''Babylon'' is contrasted with the freedom in ''Zion''), the [[Bad Brains]] song "Leaving Babylon", the [[Damian Marley]] song featuring [[Nas]] "Road to Zion", [[The Abyssinians]]' "Forward Unto Zion" and [[Kiddus I]]'s "Graduation in Zion", which is featured in the 1977 cult roots rock reggae film ''[[Rockers (1978 film)|Rockers]]'', and "Let's Go to Zion" by [[Winston Francis]]. Reggae groups such as [[Steel Pulse]] and [[Cocoa Tea]] also have many references to Zion in their various songs.

The Jewish longing for Zion, starting with the deportation and enslavement of Jews during the [[Babylonian captivity]], was adopted as a metaphor by Christian black [[slavery|slaves]] in the [[United States]].{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}{{year needed|date=January 2020}}
Thus, Zion symbolizes a longing by wandering peoples for a safe homeland. This could be an actual place such as [[Ethiopia]] for [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] or [[Israel]] for the Jews.

==Mount Zion today==
{{main|Mount Zion}}
[[File:Dormitio Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Abbey of the Dormition]] on the modern Mount Zion.]]
Today, [[Mount Zion]] refers to a hill south of the Old City's [[Armenian Quarter]], not to the Temple Mount. This apparent misidentification dates at least from the 1st century AD, when [[Josephus]] calls Jerusalem's Western Hill "Mount Zion".<ref name=Pixner>{{cite book|last=Pixner|first=Bargil|author-link=Bargil Pixner|title=Paths of the Messiah and Sites of the Early Church from Galilee to Jerusalem: Jesus and Jewish Christianity in Light of Archaeological Discoveries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bvhA6IE4VqgC&pg=PA321|year=2010|publisher=[[Ignatius Press]]|isbn=978-0-89870-865-3|page=321}}</ref> The [[Abbey of the Dormition]] and [[King David's Tomb]] are located upon the hill currently called Mount Zion.
