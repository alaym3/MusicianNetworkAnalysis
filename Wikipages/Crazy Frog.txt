'''Crazy Frog''', originally known as '''The Annoying Thing''', is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] CGI-animated character and musician created in 2003 by actor and playwright Erik Wernquist. Marketed by the [[ringtone]] provider [[Jamba!]], the character was originally created to accompany a sound effect produced by Daniel Malmedahl while attempting to imitate the sound of a [[two-stroke engine]].

The Crazy Frog spawned a worldwide hit single with a cover version of "[[Axel F (Crazy Frog song)|Axel F]]" (from [[Beverly Hills Cop (soundtrack)|the soundtrack]] of ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]''), which reached the number one spot in Turkey, New Zealand, Australia and most of Europe. The subsequent album ''[[Crazy Hits|Crazy Frog Presents Crazy Hits]]'' and second single "[[Popcorn (instrumental)#Crazy Frog version|Popcorn]]" also enjoyed worldwide chart success, and a second album entitled ''[[Crazy Frog Presents More Crazy Hits]]'' was released in 2006, as well as a third album, ''[[Everybody Dance Now (album)|Everybody Dance Now]]'', released in 2009. The Crazy Frog also spawned many singles, a range of merchandise and toys, as well as two video games before going on hiatus in 2009.

On April 22, 2020, a Twitter account for the character was created, and the account is listed on the official website,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Crazy Frog|url=https://crazyfrog.tv/|access-date=2020-07-02|website=crazyfrog.tv}}</ref> Facebook profile<ref>{{Cite web|title=CRAZY FROG|url=https://www.facebook.com/thecrazyfrogofficial/photos/a.1786206268084114/3034684236569638/?type=3|access-date=2020-07-02|website=facebook.com|language=en}}</ref> and YouTube channel.<ref>{{Cite web|title=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/post/UgwByGJPWXqZM4whuj94AaABCQ|access-date=2020-07-02|website=youtube.com}}</ref> A new album was announced later that same day.<ref name="twitter.com">https://twitter.com/TrueCrazyFrog/status/1253008412046241796 {{Bare URL inline|date=November 2021}}</ref> On November 17, 2021, it was announced that a new single will be released on December 10.<ref name="bbc.com">https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-59296288</ref>

== History ==
In 1997, 17-year-old Gothenburg student Daniel Malmedahl recorded himself imitating the noises produced by a two stroke engine. He posted this on a website and caught the attention of a Swedish television researcher, who convinced Daniel to perform the sound live on air.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4210407.stm|title='The Crazy Frog sound? That's my fault.' |publisher=BBC | date=27 January 2005|access-date=27 July 2010 |first=Giles |last=Wilson}}</ref> After it debuted on television, recordings of his performance began appearing on file sharing networks and various websites under the filename "2TAKTARE.MP3" ("''Tvåtaktare''" is Swedish for "two stroker").{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}

The sound was adopted as the sound of a [[Formula One]] car as early as 2001 in the form of "Deng Deng Form" and later "The Insanity Test" both of which were a static background of a Ferrari Formula One car accompanied by the sound.<ref>[http://www.bloggerheads.com/archives/2005/01/the_evolution_o/ The Evolution of Crazy Frog – from Deng Deng to Ringtone]. Bloggerheads.com (16 January 2005). Retrieved on 6 July 2011.</ref>

In late 2003, another Swede, Erik Wernquist, encountered the sound effect and, not knowing about the previous incarnations of the sound, was inspired to create the 3D animated character he named "The Annoying Thing" to accompany it.<ref name="hitquarters.com" /> Wernquist worked on the first animation in his spare time using the [[LightWave]] [[3D computer graphics#Modeling|3D modeling]] application, and the whole process took between 6 and 8 weeks.<ref name="hitquarters.com" /> On the 7th October 2003 he posted it on his website and on the CGTalk forum.<ref name="hitquarters.com" />

The animation was a popular attraction at Erik's website, but the sound was credited to "Anonymous". Eventually, word reached Malmedahl that his impressions had been used in a now well-known animation studio. He contacted Wernquist, apparently giving an impromptu performance to confirm his claims. Wernquist was convinced, and gave credit to Malmedahl for his creation.

The animation received attention through filesharing and word of mouth and, when [[Jamba!|Ringtone Europe]] and Jamster België (now both merged into Jamba!) got wind of this, realizing the monetary possibilities through capitalizing on the underground cult-status, they licensed the rights to the creation, renaming it "Crazy Frog" and starting to market it in mid-2004.

In an interview with [[HitQuarters]], Wernquist expressed his displeasure at the choice of name:
{{blockquote|If I had known that this was going to be such a big thing I would not have allowed them to use that stupid name. It has nothing to do with the character. It's not a frog and it's not particularly crazy either.<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_CrazyFrog.html |title='The Crazy Frog sound?

Following 2009, the character went on hiatus. In 2018, a trademark claim by Kaktus Films, the original owners alongside Erik Wernquist, had music listed as one of many rights.<ref>[http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&state=4805:251xqz.2.1]. US Trademark Search (24 May 2018).</ref> On April 22, 2020, an official [[Twitter]] account for the character was created, and later that day it was announced that a new album was in development.<ref name="twitter.com"/>

== Controversies ==
In February 2005, viewers submitted a number of complaints to the United Kingdom's [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) regarding [[Jamster!]]'s advertising campaign, complaining that Crazy Frog appeared to have a visible penis and scrotum. Some parents complained that this made inappropriate viewing for children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/article/234073/crazy-frog-keep-ding-ding-di-di-ding-asa-says |title=Crazy Frog can keep his ding-ding di-di-ding ASA says – Brand Republic News |publisher=Brandrepublic.com |date=2 February 2005 |access-date=8 May 2012}}</ref> There were also complaints regarding the frequency with which the advertisement appeared on television, reportedly up to twice an hour across most of the day,<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/tv-viewers-driven-crazy-by-frog-ringtone-ad-1-712972 Scotsman.com News]. ''The Scotsman''. Retrieved on 6 July 2011.</ref> with some channels showing it more than once per commercial break.

The ASA did not uphold the complaints, pointing out that the advert was already classified as inappropriate for airing during children's television programmes as it contained a [[premium rate telephone number]], and that it was the broadcasters' decision how often an advertisement should be shown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/NR/rdonlyres/ECE03B9D-119D-4150-8F22-48ADADD9AC09/0/ASA_Broadcast_Rulings_2Feb05.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=27 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113091721/http://www.asa.org.uk/NR/rdonlyres/ECE03B9D-119D-4150-8F22-48ADADD9AC09/0/ASA_Broadcast_Rulings_2Feb05.pdf |archive-date=13 November 2008 }}</ref> Jamster! voluntarily [[censorship|censored]] the character's genital area (via [[pixelization]]) in later broadcasts of its advertisements. Similar action occurred in Australia, with similar results.<ref>{{cite news|title=Advertising Standards Board: Ref 18/05|url=http://www.advertisingstandardsbureau.com.au/PDF/05_18.pdf|access-date=21 December 2015|publisher=Advertising Standards Board|date=17 February 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050617121041/http://www.advertisingstandardsbureau.com.au/PDF/05_18.pdf|archive-date=17 June 2005}}</ref>

In April 2005, television viewers complained about misleading advertisements produced by Jamba!, trading as [[Jamster!]] and RingtoneKing. Viewers felt that it was not made sufficiently clear that they were subscribing to a service, rather than paying a one-time fee for their ringtone. The complaints were upheld.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://asa.org.uk/~/media/Files/ASA/Old%20Broadcast%20rulings/Broadcast_rulings_6_April_05.ashx |title=Broadcast Advertising Adjucations |format=pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811220446/http://asa.org.uk/~/media/Files/ASA/Old%20Broadcast%20rulings/Broadcast_rulings_6_April_05.ashx |archive-date=11 August 2011}}</ref>

In May 2005, viewers inundated the ASA with new complaints regarding the continuous airing of the latest Crazy Frog advertisements. The intensity of the advertising was unprecedented in British television history. According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', Jamster bought 73,716 spots across all TV channels in May alone&nbsp;— an average of nearly 2,378 slots daily&nbsp;— at a cost of about £8&nbsp;million, just under half of which was spent on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. 87% of the population saw the Crazy Frog adverts an average of 26 times, 15% of the adverts appeared twice during the same advertising break and 66% were in consecutive ad breaks. An estimated 10% of the population saw the advert more than 60 times. This led to many members of the population finding the Crazy Frog, as its original name suggests, immensely irritating.<ref>(source: ''Media Guardian'', 20 June 2005)</ref>

As the authority had already adjudicated on the matter and confirmed the matter was not within its remit, the unusual step was taken of adding a notice to the ASA's online and telephone complaints system informing viewers that Jamster!-related complaints should be directed towards the broadcaster or the regulator, [[Ofcom]].{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

On 21 September 2005, the ASA ruled that the Crazy Frog, along with other Jamba ringtone advertisements, could not be shown before 9pm. This adjudication was revised on 25 January 2006, maintaining the 'upheld' decision but revising the wording of one of the points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/NR/rdonlyres/F3CC87DF-2F2A-4754-9C40-2EC23F0EC54C/0/Broadcastreport25Jan06.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=27 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029030132/http://www.asa.org.uk/NR/rdonlyres/F3CC87DF-2F2A-4754-9C40-2EC23F0EC54C/0/Broadcastreport25Jan06.pdf |archive-date=29 October 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/09/21/crazy_frog_off_air/ |title=ASA stamps on Crazy Frog TV ads |website=The Register |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051001090937/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/09/21/crazy_frog_off_air/ |archive-date=1 October 2005}}</ref>

In March 2005, [[anti-virus]] vendors discovered the "<code>W32/Crog.worm</code>" [[computer virus]] (a [[Contraction (grammar)|contraction]] of Crazy Frog), which spreads through [[file-sharing]] networks and [[MSN Messenger]], exploiting the ''Crazy Frog'''s notoriety with a promise of an animation depicting his demise.<ref>[http://www.mcafee.com/threat-intelligence/malware/default.aspx?id=132209 W32/Crog.worm]. Vil.nai.com. Retrieved on 6 July 2011.</ref><ref>[http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2005-030709-3841-99 W32.Serflog.A – Symantec.com]. Securityresponse.symantec.com. Retrieved on 6 July 2011.</ref>

On July 1, 2020, the Crazy Frog Twitter account posted a depiction of the character in a [[noose]], appearing to commit [[suicide by hanging]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Crazy Frog on Twitter: Goodbye, world.... |url=https://twitter.com/TrueCrazyFrog/status/1278427240712331265 |website=Wayback Machine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200701204115/https://twitter.com/TrueCrazyFrog/status/1278427240712331265 |access-date=23 August 2020|archive-date=1 July 2020 }}</ref> The tweet was quickly deleted and an apology was issued; the apology itself has since been deleted as well.<ref>{{cite web |title=Crazy Frog on Twitter: "A few people have access to this account.
