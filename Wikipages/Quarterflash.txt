'''Quarterflash''' (previously stylized as '''QuarterFlash''') is an American [[musical ensemble#Rock and pop bands|rock group]] formed in 1980 in [[Portland, Oregon]]. The band was originally made up of the two current members, Orinda Sue "Rindy" Ross (lead vocals and saxophone) and her husband Marv Ross (guitars), along with Jack Charles (guitars), Rick DiGiallonardo (keyboards/synthesizers), Rich Gooch (electric bass), and Brian David Willis (drums and percussion).<ref name=HistoryPortlandRock/>  Having a lead singer who also played the saxophone made Quarterflash notable.  In a 1982 interview, Rindy Ross said that she viewed the saxophone as an extension of her voice, enabling her to express things she could not express with her voice alone.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CajPfx0XMhQ Night Flight 1982] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206172503/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CajPfx0XMhQ&feature=related |date=2017-02-06 }}, concert clips and interviews, see esp. 4:04 into the video for Rindy Ross talking about what the saxophone adds to her music.{{dead link|date=July 2019}}</ref>

==Recording history==
The group was formed by merging two popular Oregon bands, '''Seafood Mama''' (formerly Beggars Opera) and '''Pilot''' (not to be confused with the [[Pilot (band)|Scottish band]] of "[[Magic (Pilot song)|Magic]]" fame).<ref>Sundial, Tri-City Herald (Washington state), Cleveland (AP), [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=c1g1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=6YcFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2287,3134958&dq=quarterflash&hl=en Quarterflash burning hot], Dec. 8, 1981, page 22.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/artist/quarterflash-p5204 |title= Quarterflash |publisher= [[Allmusic]] |access-date= July 25, 2011 |archive-date= September 8, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110908015410/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/quarterflash-p5204 |url-status= live }}</ref><ref>According to Alain Gardinier in Rindy, Marv and Jack's French interview, ''Coup de foudre ?'', ''[[:fr:Rock en stock|Rock]]'', {{nobr|# 53}}, June 1982, {{nobr|p. 14}}, the name of the second band was "Union".</ref> Continuing under the name Seafood Mama, the band originally released the picture-sleeved single "[[Harden My Heart]]" on a local private label, Whitefire Records, in the spring of 1980 (with the [[B-side]] track being "City of Roses"). "Harden My Heart" was a big hit on Portland radio stations and got the band a one-hour TV special, ''Seafood Mama In Concert'', on [[KOIN]] on June 5, 1980.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6GnRNRMS_M "Seafood Mama in Concert"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190908211637/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6GnRNRMS_M&gl=US&hl=en |date=2019-09-08 }} on [[YouTube]]</ref> "Harden My Heart" would later be rerecorded by the band after they renamed themselves ''Quarterflash''. The name came from an [[Australian English vocabulary|Australian slang]] description of new immigrants as "a quarter flash, three quarters foolish", which the Rosses found in a book at producer [[John Boylan (record producer)|John Boylan]]'s house.<ref name=HistoryPortlandRock>{{cite web |last= Clarke |first= SP |url= http://www.spclarke.com/historyofportlandrockpart1.htm |title= Part 1: Introduction |work= History of Portland Rock |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004045053/http://www.spclarke.com/historyofportlandrockpart1.htm|archive-date=2011-10-04|access-date= 2008-06-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last= Bradley |first= Clyde |url= http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/Articles/Articles07/WEHQuarterflash.htm |title= What Ever Happened to Quarterflash? |publisher= Classic Rock Revisited |access-date= 2008-06-16 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080524195352/http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/Articles/Articles07/WEHQuarterflash.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2008-05-24}}</ref>

Quarterflash signed to [[Geffen Records]] and released their self-titled debut album ''[[Quarterflash (album)|Quarterflash]]'' in September 1981. It reached No. 8 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s [[Billboard 200|Top LPs & Tapes]] chart, and sold over a million copies, earning [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] platinum status on June 30, 1982. The album contained the new version of "Harden My Heart", which became their biggest [[single (music)|single]], reaching No. 3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] (and the Top 20 in France).  The follow-up single from the album, "Find Another Fool", reached No. 16.  A second one-hour Portland television special, ''Quarterflash In Concert'', was broadcast on KOIN on October 22, 1981, and simulcast on [[KGON]]. This concert was taped at the Paramount Theatre (the present-day [[Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall]]) on October 15, 1981.

In between albums, the band appeared on soundtracks of two of 1982's biggest films, charting the theme to [[Ron Howard]]'s ''[[Night Shift (1982 film)|Night Shift]]'' up to #60 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and landing one of their B-sides, "Don't Be Lonely", in ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''.

Quarterflash released their second album, ''[[Take Another Picture]]'', in 1983. It reached No. 34 in ''Billboard'', and scored the single "Take Me to Heart", which reached No. 14. At some point after this album was released, both Charles and DiGiallonardo left the group.  Opting to continue as a four-piece, the group completed a third album featuring contributions from unofficial group keyboardist/guitarist Daniel Brandt; released in 1985, ''[[Back into Blue (album)|Back Into Blue]]'' peaked at No. 150 on ''Billboard''. The group later disbanded after getting dropped from Geffen Records.

In 1990, Quarterflash reunited, hiring [[session musician]]s, including bassist–vocalist Sandin Wilson, drummer Greg Williams, guitarist Doug Fraser, Mel Weith and Mel Kubik on saxophone and keyboards. The group released ''[[Girl in the Wind]]'' on [[Epic Records]]. In 1991, Rindy and Marv Ross founded the historic music ensemble '''The Trail Band''', which was formed at the request of the [[Oregon Historic Trails Advisory Council|Oregon Trail Advisory Council]] to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the [[Oregon Trail]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.trailband.com/meettheband.htm |title= Meet the Trail Band |publisher= The Trail Band |access-date= 2008-06-10 |archive-date= 2008-04-24 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080424091324/http://www.trailband.com/meettheband.htm |url-status= live }}</ref>

In June 2008, Marv and Rindy Ross released a new Quarterflash album, ''Goodbye Uncle Buzz'', but it did not chart.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.quarterflash.net/goodbyeunclebuzz.html |title= Marv & Rindy Ross / Quarterflash - Goodbye Uncle Buzz |publisher= Quarterflash |access-date= 2008-07-29 |archive-date= 2008-11-21 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081121031851/http://www.quarterflash.net/goodbyeunclebuzz.html |url-status= live }}</ref> In September 2013, the band released a new album, ''Love Is a Road''.<ref name=oregonian2013sep30>{{cite news|last=Ham|first=Robert|title=Quarterflash brings humility to 'Love is a Road', their first album in 20 years, plans Oregon Music Hall of Fame show|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|date=September 30, 2013|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/music/index.ssf/2013/09/quarterflash_brings_humility_a.html|access-date=October 6, 2013|archive-date=October 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003085714/http://www.oregonlive.com/music/index.ssf/2013/09/quarterflash_brings_humility_a.html|url-status=live}}</ref>
