== Career ==
After co-founding the duo Art of Origin, the emcee was signed at age 16 by music impresario [[Rick Rubin]] to Rubin's [[Def American|American Recordings]] label, which was once part of the [[Warner Bros.

Kreep charted on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard]] Bubbling Under R&B Chart for a record 23 weeks, from July 1996 to January 1997.

Chino was released from his American Recordings contract when American Recordings switched distributors from Warner to Columbia in 1997. Warner Bros. Records then signed Chino in the fall of 1997. His sophomore album was due to be released during April 1999 but numerous delays prevented the album from being released.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Billboard|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LgoEAAAAMBAJ&q=chino%2520xl%2520warner%2520billboard&pg=PA58|publisher = Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|date = December 5, 1998|first = Nielsen Business Media|last = Inc}}</ref> Although in early 2001 when the album was about to be released and its lead single "Let 'Em Live" featuring [[Kool G Rap]] was nearing early pressing stages Chino was dropped by Warner, as they folded their Black music department, supposedly due to the public legal battle with [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]. The album, titled ''[[I Told You So (Chino XL album)|I Told You So]]'', was eventually released in 2001 by Metro Records.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Chino XL: Ain't A Damn Thing Changed|url = http://allhiphop.com/2005/12/14/chino-xl-aint-a-damn-thing-changed/|website = AllHipHop|date = December 14, 2005|access-date = June 27, 2015}}</ref>

In late 2019 Freemusicempire wrote that Chino XL is "The greatest name-checker in rap history" Dan-O wrote "Chino XL has a career full of jaw dropping name drops that don't benefit him at all. In 1996 he was clowning OJ Simpson, in 2012 he was making fun of Muhammed Ali's brain stem. If you are going to drop the name of someone important do 2 things for me A.) don't walk it back and apologize B) make it heinous. Do it out of an unparalleled fearlessness. Shake the world up so the people who feel safe don't anymore….and when the consequences come take them like a seasoned criminal takes a sentence. Or don't do it at all."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://freemusicempire.com/2019/12/05/the-greatest-name-checker-in-rap-history|title = The Greatest Name-Checker in Rap History|date = December 5, 2019}}</ref>
