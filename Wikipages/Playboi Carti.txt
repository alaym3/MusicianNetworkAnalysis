Carter's [[Playboi Carti (mixtape)|debut mixtape]] was released in April 2017, and included the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] charting singles "[[Magnolia (song)|Magnolia]]" and "[[Woke Up Like This]]" (featuring [[Lil Uzi Vert]]). His debut studio album ''[[Die Lit]]'' (2018) peaked at number 3 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name="xxl">{{cite web |url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/04/best-songs-of-the-week-kendrick-lamar-playboi-carti/ |title=Best Songs of the Week Featuring Kendrick Lamar, Playboi Carti and More |last=Ivey |first=Justin |date=April 14, 2017 |publisher=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]] |access-date=April 22, 2017}}</ref><ref name="spin" /> Following a two-year hiatus with little new music released, Carter's highly anticipated second album, ''[[Whole Lotta Red]]'' (2020), debuted at number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 and became his first chart-topping release.

==Early life==
Jordan Terrell Carter was born in [[Riverdale, Georgia]],<ref> https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/playboi-carti-whole-lotta-red/</ref> and grew up in [[Fairburn, Georgia]]. In a 2016 interview with [[Complex Networks (media)|Complex]] he stated, "My ma couldn't tell me shit. Nobody could tell me shit."<ref name=":12">{{Cite web|title=Almost Famous: Playboi Carti Talks His Come Up, First Mixtape, and Working With Lil Uzi Vert|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2017/04/playboi-carti-interview|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=April 25, 2020}}</ref> This type of lifestyle influenced Carter to get into trouble as a youth and sway away from the idea of pursuing a higher level of education after high school.

In an interview with [[The Fader]] Carti said "I was a young AI and didn't go to practice. That was the time I was really ducking school and it was all hoop and no rap.
