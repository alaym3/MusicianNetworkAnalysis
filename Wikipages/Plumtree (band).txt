'''Plumtree''' was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[indie rock]]/[[power pop]] band formed in 1993 in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] which consisted of sisters Carla and Lynette Gillis, Amanda Braden, Nina Martin, and later Catriona Sturton. The band achieved moderate success during their seven years of activity, completing several tours of Canada and parts of the [[United States of America|U.S.]], as well as releasing three full-length albums, a six track EP, and various singles, before finally disbanding in June 2000.<ref>http://www.pennyblackmusic.co.uk/MagSitePages/Article.aspx?id=5691</ref><ref>http://teenagedogsintrouble.blogspot.com/2013/10/plumtree-winter-formal-2000.html</ref> Their single "Scott Pilgrim" was the inspiration for the title character in the [[Scott Pilgrim|graphic novel series]] by [[Bryan Lee O'Malley]].<ref>http://modernsuburbanite.blogspot.com/2010/07/ten-years-after-splitting-halifaxs.html</ref>

==History==
The band formed in their hometown of [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] on April 9, [[1993 in music|1993]] after meeting through their music teachers. The original line-up included Lynette Gillis (aged 14) on drums, Carla Gillis (16) on guitar and vocals, Amanda Braden (15) on guitar and vocals and Nina Martin (16) on bass and occasional vocals.

As children the Gillis siblings developed an interest in [[heavy metal music]]. Carla took guitar lessons and Lynette studied drumming. They played at home until 1993 when they recruited others to form a band. Their first band played their [[junior high school]] talent show with a setlist made up mostly of [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Iron Maiden]] covers.<ref>[http://diymag.com/archive/mass-teen-fainting-why-you-should-listen-to-plumtree "Why You Should Listen to Plumtree"]. ''DIY Magazine''</ref> The original group subsequently broke up. Braden and Martin joined the band soon after and the band developed a collaborative songwriting method. Plumtree played their first show at Halifax's all-ages Cafe Ole in June 1993.

Plumtree established themselves in [[Canada]] after releasing the song, "Follow You", on the ''No Class'' cassette, a compilation released by [[No Records]] featuring Nova Scotia high school bands. This earned them opening slots for [[Jale (band)|Jale]], [[Thrush Hermit]], [[Velocity Girl]] and [[the Spinanes]]. [[Cinnamon Toast Records]] released Plumtree's first seven-inch, ''Green Mittens'', in 1994. It featured the songs "Dog Gone Crazy" and "Have a Banana", plus two songs from [[Prince Edward Island]]'s Strawberry on the other side. Shortly after, Plumtree released a six-song cassette entitled ''Flutterboard''.

In 1995, Plumtree recorded their first full-length album, ''Mass Teen Fainting'', at Sound of One Hand Studios in [[Ottawa]], with Paul Hogan. The CD was played on college radio and this gained Plumtree a dedicated Canadian fanbase. Martin left the band in September 1995 to pursue undergraduate work at [[McGill University]]. She was replaced by [[Ottawa]] native [[Catriona Sturton]] in [[1996 in music|1996]].

Plumtree's second album, ''Predicts the Future'', was recorded in [[1997 in music|1997]] with Laurence Currie at Idea of East studios in Halifax. Released in [[1998 in music|1998]], the CD led to the Plumtree's appearance on the cover of Canada's music monthly, ''Exclaim!'', as well as to the No.&nbsp;1 spot on the national college radio chart, Earshot. Videos for the singles "Scott Pilgrim", "Go", and "You Just Don't Exist" received regular airplay on [[MuchMusic]]. ("Scott Pilgrim" went on to inspire the popular graphic novel series, ''[[Scott Pilgrim]]'', by [[Bryan Lee O'Malley]]).

During these early years, Plumtree released a number of songs on vinyl and CD compilations, including ''Water Had Leaked into My Suit'' (Cinnamon Toast), ''You're a Superlady'' (Corduroy), ''Secret Songs'' (Korova Cafe) and ''Syrup and Gasoline'' (Grenadine). An earlier version of "Scott Pilgrim" can also be found on a split seven-inch Plumtree released with The Inbreds on the PF label.

The band toured extensively throughout its seven-year career, hitting the road with Montreal's [[The Local Rabbits]], Halifax bands [[Thrush Hermit]], [[The Inbreds]] and [[The Super Friendz]], [[Moncton]]'s Julie Doiron (formerly of [[Eric's Trip]]) and Winnipeg's [[The Weakerthans]] and Duotang. Plumtree could only tour during the summer months as they attended university during the school months.

In 1999, Plumtree performed in Toronto at the Horseshoe Tavern with Number One Cup.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20000203205502/http://chartattack.com/road/reviews/1999/19990127-plumtree.html "Live Reviews: Plumtree/Number One Cup January 27, 1999 The Horseshoe Tavern, Toronto, ON"]. ''Chart Attack''</ref> They spent the summer in [[Toronto]] recording ''This Day Won't Last at All'' with [[Justin Deneau]] at Electro Magnetic Sound Studios. It was released in [[2000 in music|2000]] by Winnipeg-based [[Endearing Records]]. A [[Cindy Sherman]]-inspired video for the song, "Regret", received airplay on MuchMusic.
