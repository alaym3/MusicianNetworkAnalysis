On December 24th 2020 the bands fourth studio album "''At The Moonbase"'' made a surprise release. The album itself was written and recorded in solitary by Ewald due to the COVID-19 pandemic.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-12-24|title=Slaughter Beach, Dog surprise releases new album At the Moonbase: Stream|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/12/slaughter-beach-dog-at-the-moonbase-stream/|access-date=2021-03-17|website=Consequence of Sound|language=en-US}}</ref> 

The name is derived from a town in [[Delaware]] called [[Slaughter Beach, Delaware|Slaughter Beach]]. Ewald expressed a desire to name the band Slaughter Beach, having come across the location travelling between his house in Philadelphia and his parents house in Delaware. However, after discovering the name was already in use by another band in Europe, Ewald simply added a comma and the word "Dog".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Slaughter Beach, Dog Interview – WUOG 90.5 FM|url=http://wuog.org/index.php/2018/01/17/slaughter-beach-dog-interview/|access-date=2021-03-10|language=en-US}}</ref>
