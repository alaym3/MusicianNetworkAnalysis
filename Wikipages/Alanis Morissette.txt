== Music career ==
=== 1987–1992: ''Alanis'' and ''Now Is the Time'' ===
Morissette recorded her first demo called "Fate Stay with Me", produced by Lindsay Thomas Morgan at Marigold Studios in Toronto, engineered by [[Rich Dodson]] of Canadian classic rock band [[The Stampeders]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Andrew McIntosh|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/alanis-morissette-emc|title=Alanis Morissette|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Music in Canada]]|access-date=September 8, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190106161644/https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/alanis-morissette-emc|archive-date=January 6, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> A second demo tape was recorded on cassette in August 1989 and sent to [[Geffen Records]], but the tape has never been heard as it was stolen, among other records, in a burglary of the label's headquarters in October 1989.

In 1991, [[MCA Records|MCA Records Canada]] released Morissette's debut album, ''[[Alanis (album)|Alanis]]'', in Canada only. Morissette co-wrote every track on the album with its producer, [[Leslie Howe]]. The [[dance-pop]] album went [[platinum album|platinum]],<ref name="CRIA">[http://www.cria.ca/cert_db_search.php "Search Certification Database"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601023939/http://www.cria.ca/cert_db_search.php |date=June 1, 2009 }}.

Subsequent singles "[[Walk Away (Alanis Morissette song)|Walk Away]]" and "[[Feel Your Love]]" reached the top 40. Morissette's popularity, style of music and appearance, particularly that of her hair, led her to become known as the [[Debbie Gibson]] of Canada;<ref name="PeopleintheNews">[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0301/04/pitn.00.html "Transcript: Profiles of Alanis Morissette, Margaret Cho"].

In 1992, she released her second album, ''[[Now Is the Time]]'', a [[Sentimental ballad|ballad]]-driven record that featured less glitzy production than ''Alanis'' and contained more thoughtful lyrics.<ref name="PeopleintheNews" /> Morissette wrote the songs with the album's producer, Leslie Howe, and Serge Côté. She said of the album, "People could go, 'Boo, hiss, hiss, this girl's like another Tiffany or whatever.' But the way I look at it ... people will like your next album if it's a kick-ass one."<ref name="Time-Feb1996" /> As with ''Alanis'' (1991), ''Now Is the Time'' (1992) was released only in Canada and produced three top 40 singles—"[[An Emotion Away]]", the minor [[adult contemporary]] hit "[[No Apologies (Alanis Morissette song)|No Apologies]]" as well as "(Change Is) Never a Waste of Time". The industry considered it a commercial failure, however, since it sold only a little more than half the copies of her first album.<ref name="PeopleintheNews" /><ref name="RS-Nov1995">Wild, David.

Maverick Records released ''[[Jagged Little Pill]]'' internationally in 1995. The album was expected only to sell enough for Morissette to make a follow-up, but the situation improved quickly when [[KROQ-FM]], an influential Los Angeles [[modern rock]] radio station, began playing "[[You Oughta Know]]", the album's first single, featuring [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] and [[Dave Navarro]].<ref name="SongwriterUniverseMagazine">{{cite news | last=Kawashima | first=Dale | url=http://www.songwriteruniverse.com/alanis.html | title=Great Publishing Story: John Alexander & Alanis Morissette | work=Songwriter Universe Magazine | access-date=June 11, 2010 }}</ref> The song instantly garnered attention for its scathing, explicit lyrics,<ref name="PeopleintheNews" /> and a subsequent music video went into heavy rotation on MTV and [[MuchMusic]].

Morissette was featured as a guest vocalist on [[Ringo Starr]]'s cover of "[[Drift Away]]" on his 1998 album, ''[[Vertical Man]]'', and on the songs "[[Don't Drink the Water (Dave Matthews Band song)|Don't Drink the Water]]" and "[[Spoon (Dave Matthews Band song)|Spoon]]" on the [[Dave Matthews Band]] album ''[[Before These Crowded Streets]]''. She recorded the song "[[Uninvited (song)|Uninvited]]" for the soundtrack to the 1998 film ''[[City of Angels (film)|City of Angels]]''. Although the track was never commercially released as a single, it received widespread radio airplay in the U.S. At the [[1999 Grammy Awards]], it won in the categories of Best Rock Song and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, and was nominated for [[Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media]].<ref>[http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/1998/1998grammy.htm "1998 41st Grammy Awards"]. ''Los Angeles Times''.</ref> Later in 1998, Morissette released her fourth album, ''[[Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie]]'', which she wrote and produced with Glen Ballard.

The label hoped to sell 1 million copies of the album on initial release;<ref name="EW-Nov1998" /> instead, it debuted at number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart with first-week sales of 469,000 copies—a record, at the time, for the highest first-week sales of an album by a female artist.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071203065648/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20000525/ai_n13864275 "'Oops!'

Morissette contributed vocals to "Mercy", "Hope", "Innocence" and "Faith", four tracks on [[Jonathan Elias]]'s project ''[[The Prayer Cycle]]'', which was released in 1999. The same year, she released the live acoustic album ''[[Alanis Unplugged]]'', which was recorded during her appearance on the television show ''[[MTV Unplugged]]''. It featured tracks from her previous two albums alongside four new songs, including "[[King of Pain]]" (a cover of [[The Police]] song) and "No Pressure over Cappuccino", which Morissette wrote with her main guitar player, Nick Lashley. The recording of the ''Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie'' track "[[That I Would Be Good]]", released as a single, became a minor hit on [[hot adult contemporary]] radio in America. Also in 1999, Morissette released a live version of her song "Are You Still Mad" on the charity album ''[[Live in the X Lounge#Live in the X Lounge II (1999)|Live in the X Lounge II]]''. For her live rendition of "So Pure" at [[Woodstock '99]], she was nominated for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance at the [[2001 Grammy Awards]].<ref>[http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/2000/2000grammy.htm "2000 43rd Grammy Awards"].

=== 2001–2005: ''Under Rug Swept'' and ''So-Called Chaos'' ===
In 2001, Morissette was featured with [[Stephanie McKay]] on the [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]] song "Excess", which is on <!--This "his" refers to Tricky, not Morissette-->his album ''[[Blowback (album)|Blowback]]''. Morissette released her fifth studio album, ''[[Under Rug Swept]]'', in February 2002. For the first time in her career, she took on the role of sole writer and producer of an album. Her band, comprising [[Pedestrian (band)|Joel Shearer]], Nick Lashley, Chris Chaney, and Gary Novak, played the majority of the instruments; additional contributions came from [[Eric Avery]], [[Dean DeLeo]], [[Flea (musician)|Flea]], and [[Meshell Ndegeocello]].

''Under Rug Swept'' debuted at number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart, eventually going platinum in Canada and selling one million copies in the U.S.<ref name="CRIA" /><ref name="AskBillboard">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/951082/ask-billboard-taylor-swift-the-script-alanis-morissette|title= Ask Billboard: Taylor Swift, The Script, Alanis Morissette|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=November 26, 2010|date=November 12, 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101126025658/http://www.billboard.com/| archive-date= November 26, 2010 | url-status=live}}</ref> It produced the hit single "[[Hands Clean]]", which topped the [[Canadian Singles Chart]] and received substantial radio play; for her work on "Hands Clean" and "[[So Unsexy]]", Morissette won a [[Juno Award for Producer of the Year]].<ref>[http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/2002/2002junob.htm "2002 33rd Juno Awards"].

Later in 2002, Morissette released the combination package ''[[Feast on Scraps]]'', which includes a DVD of live concert and backstage documentary footage directed by her and a CD containing eight previously unreleased songs from the ''Under Rug Swept'' recording sessions. Preceded by the single "Simple Together", it sold roughly 70,000 copies in the U.S. and was nominated for a [[Juno Award for Music DVD of the Year]].<ref name="AskBillboard"/><ref>[http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/2003/2003juno.htm "2003 34th Juno Awards"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519092819/http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/2003/2003juno.htm |date=May 19, 2006 }}.

Morissette hosted the [[Juno Awards of 2004]] dressed in a bathrobe, which she took off to reveal a flesh-colored bodysuit, a response to the era of [[censorship]] in the U.S. caused by [[Janet Jackson]]'s breast-flash incident during the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show]].<ref name="CP-Apr2004" /> Morissette released her sixth studio album, ''[[So-Called Chaos]]'', in May 2004.<ref name="Simonot"/> She wrote the songs on her own again, and co-produced the album with [[Tim Thorney]] and pop music producer [[John Shanks]].

Because the first line of the song includes the word "asshole", American radio stations refused to play it, and the single version was changed to include the word "nightmare" instead.<ref name="CP-Apr2004">[https://web.archive.org/web/20050312125231/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/mini/CTVNews/1081193845483_76603045?s_name=junos2004&no_ads=y.

To commemorate the 10th anniversary of ''Jagged Little Pill'' (1995), Morissette released a studio [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic]] version, ''[[Jagged Little Pill Acoustic]]'', in June 2005. The album was released exclusively through [[Starbucks]]' [[Hear Music]] retail concept through their coffee shops for a six-week run. The limited availability led to a dispute between Maverick Records and [[HMV]] North America, who retaliated by removing Morissette's other albums from sale for the duration of Starbucks's exclusive six-week sale.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4095358.stm "Morissette in Starbucks album row"].

Morissette released the [[greatest hits album]] ''[[Alanis Morissette: The Collection]]'' in late 2005. The lead single and only new track, a cover of [[Seal (musician)|Seal]]'s "[[Crazy (Seal song)|Crazy]]", was an Adult Top 40 and dance hit in the U.S., but achieved only minimal chart success elsewhere. A limited edition of ''The Collection'' features a DVD including a documentary with videos of two unreleased songs from Morissette's 1996 Can't Not Tour: "King of Intimidation" and "Can't Not". (A reworked version of "Can't Not" had also appeared on ''Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie''.)

2006 marked the first year in Morissette's musical career without a single concert appearance showcasing her own songs, with the exception of an appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' in January when she performed "Wunderkind".

On April 1, 2007, Morissette released a tongue-in-cheek cover of [[The Black Eyed Peas]]'s selection "[[My Humps]]", which she recorded in a slow, mournful voice, accompanied only by a piano. The accompanying YouTube-hosted video, in which she dances provocatively with a group of men and hits the ones who act as if attempting to touch her breasts, had received 16,465,653 views as of February 15, 2009.<ref name="Undercover.com.au">The Celebrity Truth.

Morissette performed at a gig for [[The Nightwatchman]], a.k.a. [[Tom Morello]] of [[Rage Against the Machine]] and [[Audioslave]], at the Hotel Café in Los Angeles in April 2007.

Morissette's seventh studio album, ''[[Flavors of Entanglement]]'', which was produced by [[Guy Sigsworth]], was released in mid-2008. She has stated that in late 2008, she would embark on a North American headlining tour, but in the meantime she would be promoting the album internationally by performing at shows and festivals and making television and radio appearances. The album's first single was "[[Underneath (Alanis Morissette song)|Underneath]]", a video for which was submitted to the 2007 Elevate Film Festival, the purpose of which festival was to create documentaries, music videos, narratives and shorts regarding subjects to raise the level of human consciousness on the earth.<ref name="ElevateFilmFestival-Sept15">{{Cite web|url=http://www.elevatefilmfestival.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060603181528/http://www.elevatefilmfestival.com/|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 3, 2006|title=Elevate Film Festival|date=June 3, 2006|access-date=October 6, 2019}}</ref> On October 3, 2008, Morissette released the video for her latest single, "[[Not as We]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB_gbWUWIuQ |title=Broadcast Yourself |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=April 6, 2009 |access-date=February 18, 2010}}</ref>
