'''''Nostalgia Critic''''' is an American review [[comedy]] [[web series]] created, directed by and starring web comedian [[Doug Walker (comedian)|Douglas "Doug" Walker]]. The series initially launched on [[YouTube]] on July 3, 2007, before moving to Walker's own site, That Guy with the Glasses, then to [[Channel Awesome]]. The show follows Walker as the title character, a bitter and sarcastic critic who mostly reviews films and television shows from his childhood and recent past, usually with comically exaggerated rage. The show often alternates the Critic's angry rants and humor with analysis of the episode's subject. Some of the films he reviewed (such as ''[[Exorcist II: The Heretic]]'', ''[[The Garbage Pail Kids Movie]]'', and ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'') are generally [[List of films considered the worst|considered as the worst films ever made]].

Walker briefly retired the series on August 14, 2012, to work on other projects, even writing the character out of existence in the Channel Awesome film ''To Boldly Flee''. On January 22, 2013, Walker announced [[Retroactive continuity|the show's return in a narrative video]] called "The Review Must Go On".<ref name="thereview">{{cite web |url=http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/nostalgia-critic/38009-the-review-must-go-on |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127005155/http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/nostalgia-critic/38009-the-review-must-go-on |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 27, 2013 |title=The Review Must Go On |publisher=[[That Guy with the Glasses]] |access-date=January 22, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The show subsequently returned with a more narrative and [[Sketch comedy|sketch]]-driven sixth season, beginning on February 5, 2013, with a review of ''[[The Odd Life of Timothy Green]]''. Most episodes still retain the original clip using format.

==Main cast==
* '''Doug Walker''': Nostalgia Critic, the aggressive, childish and hot-tempered film critic and a fictionalized version of Doug Walker himself. He is characterized by his angry rants and hatred of bad movies. All of the reviews star him as the main character and feature him providing commentary and criticism while talking directly to the audience.
* '''Rob Walker''': Rob is Doug's real-life older brother who appears in most of the Critic's videos as "The Other Guy" as well as different minor and major characters, notably [[Santa Claus|Santa]] [[Jesus|Christ]].
* '''Malcolm Ray''': Malcolm is one of the Critic's friends who appears on the show and works with him on his videos. Malcolm often plays many secondary characters, most notably as the [[Devil]] in some of the sketches.
* '''Rachel Tietz:''' She is a friend of the Critic's who worked with him and Malcolm on the show. She played multiple characters, including Evilina (the daughter of the Devil and [[Kim Kardashian]]) and [[Rita Repulsa]] (though her voice was dubbed by Doug Walker in that role). She later left the show after season six to pursue her career in Los Angeles but has made some cameos in later episodes, most recently in the review of ''[[Con Air]].''
* '''Tamara Chambers:''' After Rachel left the show to pursue a career in Los Angeles, Tamara stepped in to take her place. She has her own short series called ''Tamara's Never Seen'', where she watches iconic movies for the first time. She also plays a recurring character called Hyper [[Fangirl]]. She also has a second short series called ''Tamara Just Saw'', where she opens talking about a brand new movie that she has just seen.
* '''Jim Jarosz''': Jim is a friend of the Critic's who often works with Tamara and Malcolm, though he is not present in every episode as Tamara and Malcolm are. He is mainly responsible for most of the props and set pieces in the show, most notably for the review of ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road]]''.
* '''Walter Banasiak''': Walter is one of the hosts of Awesome Comics & Coffee, another show on Channel Awesome, alongside Jim and Heather Reusz. He also created the show Top 5, in which he counts down his Top 5 favorite or least favorite things. He also runs ''Bat-May'', in which he reviews episodes from ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' during the entire month of May, and ''Twilight-Tober Zone'', in which he reviews episodes of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' during the entire month of October. 
* '''Heather Reusz''': Heather, besides starring alongside the cast in Nostalgia Critic skits, helps to run the Twitch channel, where the cast play video games, watch movies, or just chat with the audience.
 
('''Note:''' All of the cast members often play fictionalized versions of their real counterparts.)

==History==
The series was initially launched on [[YouTube]] on July 3, 2007 with a review of ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'', but episodes were frequently removed by the website following complaints of copyright infringement. In April 2008, the videos were taken down from YouTube but an arrangement between the company and content host [[Blip (website)|Blip]] in 2009 resulted in them being featured on YouTube once more.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2007/nov/19/thefivesecondmoviesandwhyyoushouldwatchthem |title=The five-second movies and why you should watch them |access-date=2008-12-09 |first=Anna |last=Pickard |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=November 19, 2007}}</ref><ref name="adage">{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Learmonth |title=Blip.tv Brings Programs to YouTube, Ads to 'Channel Awesome' |url=http://adage.com/digital/article?article_id=138164 |archive-date=7 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107044725/http://adage.com/article/digital/blip-tv-brings-programs-youtube-ads-channel-awesome/138164/ |work=[[Advertising Age]] |date=July 28, 2009 |access-date=July 30, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The announcement of a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]], called ''The Nostalgia Chick'', was created in "The Search for the Nostalgia Chick" (August 10, 2008). The concept was for a female host to review female-targeted "nostalgic" films and television.<ref name="manhour">{{cite web|url=http://www.themanhour.net/|title=The Man Hour|last1=Jenkins|first1=Mike|last2=Bacio|first2=Jose|date=June 19, 2009|work=Man Hour Goes Nostalgic|access-date=December 24, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202203357/http://www.themanhour.net/|archive-date=February 2, 2010|url-status=dead}} ([https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-man-hour-blog-talk-radio/id297194268 iTunes])</ref> The contest ended in a three-way tie between [[Lindsay Ellis (Nostalgia Chick)|Lindsay Ellis]] (who reviewed [[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Disney's ''Pocahontas'']]), Krissy Diggs (who reviewed ''[[Sailor Moon]]''), and Kaylyn Saucedo (who reviewed ''[[The Last Unicorn (film)|The Last Unicorn]]''). The competition was won by Ellis, then using the name "The Dudette", as announced on the site, "Nostalgia Chick Winner!" (September 15, 2008).<ref name="manhour" /> Diggs and Saucedo would still join That Guy with the Glasses as That Chick with the Goggles and Marzgurl, respectively.

On September 14, 2012, Walker announced the retirement of ''Nostalgia Critic'' and that it would no longer be a weekly production, as he and his brother felt that they had gone as far as they could with the series. Walker then focused his efforts on another web series called ''Demo Reel'', but on January 22, 2013, Walker released a sketch short film titled "The Review Must Go On", announcing the return of the ''Nostalgia Critic''; Malcolm Ray and Rachel Tietz of ''Demo Reel'' joined the series as side characters.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pickett |first1=Leah |title=Get to know the man behind 'Nostalgia Critic' |url=https://www.wbez.org/stories/get-to-know-the-man-behind-the-nostalgia-critic/08495f51-e0d4-40cc-b54b-280a22b33c7e |access-date=March 19, 2021 |work=[[WBEZ|WBEZ Chicago]] |date=November 21, 2013 |language=en}}</ref> On December 30, 2015, Nostalgia Critic aired its 300th episode, a review of ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''. On October 10, 2018, ''Nostalgia Critic'' aired its 400th episode, a countdown of the top 11 [[Stephen King]] movies. On October 14, 2020, it aired its 500th episode, a review of ''[[The Stand (1994 miniseries)|The Stand]]''.

==Episode format==
The series focuses on the Nostalgia Critic, a short-tempered film reviewer looking back at films usually from his childhood and adolescence. GigaOM describes it as "high energy and shamelessly [[nerd]]y".<ref name="gigaom1">{{cite web|last=Shannon |first=Liz |url=http://gigaom.com/2009/10/06/nostalgia-critic-takes-apart-your-childhood-favorites/ |title=Nostalgia Critic Takes Apart Your Childhood Favorites — Tech News and Analysis |publisher=Gigaom.com |date=October 6, 2009 |access-date=October 20, 2013}}</ref> Reuters described him as having "offbeat personalities".<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/10/13/idUS110259+13-Oct-2009+BW20091013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129123238/https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/10/13/idUS110259+13-Oct-2009+BW20091013 |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 29, 2014 |title=South Florida's Largest Video Game Event Gathers Hottest Video Games, Gamers, World Champs and Game Platforms Creators |author=[[Business Wire]] |publisher=Reuters |date=October 13, 2009 |access-date=October 20, 2013}}</ref> In each episode, the Critic restates important plot-points, guiding the viewer, while making jokes out of notable or questionable scenes. The reviews are interspersed with recurring memes, false or satirical dubbing of dialogue, comedic sketches and pop culture gags{{ndash}}such as making fun of famous actors who starred in lesser-known roles before their rise to fame. The show also features special episodes, such as the "Top 11" list countdowns for his favorite or least favorite films, villains, or moments in television shows; and "Old vs. New" which compares the [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of a popular film or series to the original.

Since the revival of the series in 2013, Walker occasionally produces an editorial which discusses relevant film topics; while still featuring the Critic persona, these videos are much less comedic and contain no sketches or other actors. Beginning with ''[[Jurassic World]]'' on June 23, 2015, the series also occasionally features "clipless reviews" of films that are still currently in theaters to avoid [[copyright infringement]] instead of stills and clips. These reviews instead feature scenes from the movies re-enacted comedically by Walker, his family and other [[Channel Awesome]] contributors.

Walker describes his philosophy thus: "[We need a critic of nostalgia] because everybody already does it. When we look at movies and shows from our youth, they're rarely as good as we remember them, and oftentimes it's quite humorous to compare what you liked then to what you like now. That's basically what the Nostalgia Critic is about, looking back at just how much nostalgia cloaked our vision in heavenly bliss and how bizarre the reality is."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.courant.com/2011-01-28/entertainment/hc-nostalgia-critic-0130-20110128_1_uconn-football-team-video-games-nerds |title=U-Con at UConn is for the Nerds|work=[[The Hartford Courant]] |last=Dunne |first=Susan |date=2011-01-28 |access-date=2013-10-20}}</ref> This is mostly reflected in the series, but sometimes he reviews whatever is popular at the moment.

==Reception==
''Nostalgia Critic'' received a positive response with many praising the humor, characters, and Doug Walker's performance. [[Greg Weisman]], producer of ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'', stated that he enjoyed the Critic's review of the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/search.php?qid=11558 |title=Search Ask Greg : Gargoyles : Station Eight |publisher=S8.org |access-date=2013-10-20}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] called the episode "A Tribute to Siskel and Ebert" "the best, funniest video about Siskel & Ebert I've ever seen".<ref name="ebert">{{cite tweet|user=ebertchicago|first=Roger|last=Ebert|number=5711089913|date=14 November 2009|title=The best, funniest  video about Siskel & Ebert I've ever seen. http://j.mp/kpxx8 From Nostalgia Critic http://j.mp/1z4pVJ}}</ref> Walker later stated in his editorial titled "Farewell to Roger Ebert" that he has since had the quote framed and hung up on his wall, and in "The Making of a Nostalgia Critic Episode", it can be seen on his desk.<ref name="Wall Quote">{{cite web |last=Walker |first=Doug |title=Animaniacs Tribute |work=Nostalgia Critic Animaniacs Tribute |date=August 11, 2010 |url=http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/nostalgia-critic/27440-animaniacs-tribute |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815040719/http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/nostalgia-critic/27440-animaniacs-tribute |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 15, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Animation writer [[Paul Dini]] also thanked the Critic for his episode "The Top 11 ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' Episodes".<ref>{{cite tweet|user=Paul_Dini|first=Paul|last=Dini|number=103714757961465856|date=17 August 2011|title=Thanks both to  @TGWTG for his nice words about B:TAS and to everyone who pointed me to his list.
