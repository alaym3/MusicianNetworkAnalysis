She first gained attention with a 2004 live solo performance of her song "[[Black Horse and the Cherry Tree]]" on ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]''.

The name of her debut album, ''[[Eye to the Telescope]],'' was inspired by her childhood experiences at her father's physics laboratory at [[University of St Andrews]]. Released in 2004, this album launched her music career. That album inspired her nomination for the [[Mercury Prize]] in 2005, [[Brit Awards|BRIT Award]] for Best British Live Act and BRIT Award for Best Breakthrough Act in 2006, and [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] in 2007. She eventually won BRIT Award for Best British Female Artist and [[European Border Breakers Award]], both in 2006. The single "Black Horse and the Cherry Tree" was given the [[Q Magazine]] Award for Best Track in 2005, and "[[Suddenly I See]]" won the [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Award]] for Best Song in 2006. "Suddenly I See" became a popular hit and has been featured in ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]]''; ''[[Blind Dating]]''; ''[[Ugly Betty]]''; ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''; and ''[[Love, Rosie (film)|Love, Rosie]]''; ''[[Thrillville]]'', and as a [[campaign song]] of the [[Hillary Clinton 2008 presidential campaign]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Suddenly I See by KT Tunstall|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=7486|website=SongFacts|access-date=2 January 2016|archive-date=11 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111084504/http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=7486|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Lyons|first1=Beverly|title=The View song chosen for Nike's new ad campaign|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/the-view-song-chosen-for-nikes-new-1011147|access-date=2 January 2016|work=Daily Record|date=1 July 2012|archive-date=11 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111084503/http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/the-view-song-chosen-for-nikes-new-1011147|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Music career==

===Career beginnings===
[[File:KT Tunstall in October 2005.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Tunstall performing at the [[Cardiff University Students' Union]], October 2005]]
Throughout Tunstall's twenties, she played in [[indie music]] bands including Elia Drew<ref name="Drew">[http://www.optigon.co.uk/341FE4BF-D9E3-4A17-BBFD-83D55A961F57/Elia%20Drew.html Elia Drew] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012141318/http://www.optigon.co.uk/341FE4BF-D9E3-4A17-BBFD-83D55A961F57/Elia%20Drew.html |date=12 October 2007 }}</ref> and Tomoko. She focused on songwriting, as well as performing with members of the fledgling Fence Collective. Tunstall had lived with [[Lone Pigeon|Gordon Anderson]], ([[The Beta Band]], and [[The Aliens (Scottish band)|The Aliens]]), whom the song "Funnyman", on the album ''[[Drastic Fantastic]]'', is about. She toured with the [[klezmer]] band [[Oi Va Voi]], and stayed with them while they were making their album, ''[[Laughter Through Tears]]''.

British label [[Relentless Records]] put forward an independent offer.<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_ShabsJobanputra.html |title=Interview With Shabs Jobanputra |publisher=HitQuarters |date=13 November 2005 |access-date=22 June 2010 |archive-date=29 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929041110/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_ShabsJobanputra.html |url-status=live }}</ref> However, Tunstall had decided to sign with a US major, and initially passed up the offer.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> But when that deal did not work out, she decided to go with Relentless.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> Although Relentless co-founder Shabs Jobanputra recognised the potential in the quality of Tunstall's voice and songs in the early 2000s, his assessment then was that she "wasn't ready yet" and so together with Tunstall's manager, Jobanputra discussed "the process of how we saw her happening and how we would work, why we thought the songs were great, why we thought she was great, and why it could really work if we took enough time."<ref name="hitquarters.com" />

Tunstall released an acoustic collection album on 15 May 2006, ''[[KT Tunstall's Acoustic Extravaganza]]'', which was first only available via [[mail order]] from her website.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/music/reviews/albums/kt-tunstall-acoustic-extravaganza |title=KT Tunstall – Acoustic Extravaganza |work=The Skinny |date=15 June 2006 |access-date=24 September 2016 |author=Hurley, Caroline |archive-date=27 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927033923/http://www.theskinny.co.uk/music/reviews/albums/kt-tunstall-acoustic-extravaganza |url-status=live }}</ref> The album was re-released in stores worldwide in October 2006.

Tunstall's North American break came when ''[[American Idol]]'' contestant [[Katharine McPhee]] contacted her asking to use "Black Horse and the Cherry Tree" as her choice for a ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''-themed week. At the time, the song was No. 79 on the ''Billboard'' charts.<ref name=greys>{{citation |title=KT Tunstall: Grey's Music Mainstay|publisher=greysanatomyinsider}}

They're told how to sing."<ref name=mp3.com/> She chose to license the song as she felt that "no one on that show told Katharine McPhee to sing my song because no one knew it".<ref name=mp3.com/> Tunstall's belief was correct—the song was suggested to McPhee by ''Billboard'' columnist and author [[Fred Bronson]].<ref name=billboard.com>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/chart_beat/chat_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003725821 |title=He's Just Seen A Face |access-date=4 April 2008 |author=Fred Bronson |date=14 March 2008 |work=Billboard |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321234733/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/chart_beat/chat_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003725821 |archive-date=21 March 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>

Tunstall also worked with [[Suzanne Vega]] on her 2007 album ''[[Beauty & Crime]]'', singing backup on songs "Zephyr and I" and "Frank and Ava". It was revealed in the booklet by Vega that the two had never met during the process of making the album.

Tunstall said, "I had an amazing three weeks recording in Hansa in Berlin in January and am finishing it all off in London."

=== 2013–2014 ''Invisible Empire // Crescent Moon'' and other ventures ===
On 20 March 2013, Tunstall announced that her fourth album would be titled ''[[Invisible Empire // Crescent Moon]]'', considered as her best by most critics and her most melancholic album to date. The title is inspired by the two batches of songs from the album: ''Invisible Empire,'' recorded in April 2012, is the melancholic half that deals with her father's death and the theme of mortality, while the ''Crescent Moon'' half, recorded in November 2012, is full of songs that are more ethereal. These thirteen songs formed an album that Tunstall qualified as "from the heart," inspired by her divorce from [[Luke Bullen]] and her father's passing away.

''Invisible Empire // Crescent Moon'' premiered in the United Kingdom on 10 June 2013, while it was released in Germany and Australia on 7 June, and in Japan and Canada on 11 June. However, the release date was pushed back to 6 August 2013 in the United States. Meanwhile, the lead single, "[[Feel It All]]", was released worldwide on 10 June, and its music video on 29 April.

In its first week, the album entered the UK charts at No. 14 and it was a modest commercial performer in Europe: it peaked at No. 52 in Belgium, No. 84 in Netherlands, No. 240 in France, No. 7 in Scotland, and No. 56 in Switzerland. On the other hand, the album received the best reviews and ratings Tunstall has ever received.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}
