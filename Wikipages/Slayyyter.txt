==Early life and career==

===Early life===
Slayyyter is from [[Kirkwood, Missouri]], a suburb of St. Louis, where she has "kind of lived [her] whole life". She went to private grade schools, and later continued her education in public school, where she was "offered great music classes for the first time."<ref name="V Magazine 2016">{{cite web | title=Exclusive: Slayyyter is Music's Internet Princess | website=V Magazine | date=April 12, 2016 | url=https://vmagazine.com/article/exclusive-slayyyter-is-musics-internet-princess/ | accessdate=February 15, 2019}}</ref>

===2017–2018: Early approaches to music and first single releases===
Slayyyter spent a year in college, studying at the [[University of Missouri]]. This time was an "expensive experiment" in which she started her career as a musician, writing "'80s lo-fi pop" that she herself produced and edited, but never published. She later dropped out and committed fully to her music career. Her most frequent collaborator, Ayesha Erotica, is from [[Los Angeles]]. The artists met through [[Twitter]], which is where Slayyyter first developed a following. The artist credits [[Stan Twitter]] for introducing her to Ayesha.<ref name="FADER 2018" /><ref>{{cite web| title= Slayyyter is gonna get what she wants (after she pays off her student loans) | website=[[The Fader]] | url=https://www.thefader.com/2019/09/04/slayyyter-dial-tone-interview | accessdate=May 11, 2021}}</ref>

Apart from Slayyyter's debut single "BFF", the singles "Ghost", "Candy", "Alone", "Hello Kitty" (produced by Boy Sim but written by Ayesha), and "All I Want for XXXmas" also sprung from the collaboration between the two artists. Slayyyter's 2018 single releases included "I'm High" (produced by GhostHaus) and "Platform Shoes" (produced by Boy Sim).

=== Controversy ===
In 2019, it was revealed that Slayyyter made a series of [[twitter|tweets]] in 2012 and 2013 containing racial slurs. She later apologized for the tweets, saying that "I have grown and changed so much in the past eight years and the person I am today is not who I was at age 15. Eight years is a lot of time to reflect, grow, mature and better yourself as a human being. And I know that being young or uneducated about the matter also does not excuse any of these things, but please know that people do change."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Slayyyter Takes 'Full Accountability' for Past Racist Tweets|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/pride/8547803/slayyyter-apology-note-racist-tweets|access-date=2021-09-05|website=Billboard|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-12-27|title=Pop star Slayyyter has apologised for resurfaced racist tweets|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/slayyyter-racist-tweets-apology-camila-cabello-charli-xcx-a9261166.html|access-date=2021-01-23|website=The Independent|language=en}}</ref> As a result, Slayyyter committed funds resulting from her CD and vinyl sales to the Sylvia Rivera Law Project and Black Trans Travel Fund, two charities benefitting black trans youth.<ref>{{cite tweet |user=slayyyter |title=back to announce that i have made donations to the Sylvia Rivera Law Project @SLRP and also to the @BlkTransTravelFund , two amazing organizations that benefit and provide resources for black trans women. |number=1226972427604889605 |access-date=May 14, 2021}}</ref>
