==Biography==

===''Spinvis''===
In 2001, Erik de Jong, or Spinvis, at the age of 40, sent a three-song demo to the Dutch indie label, [[Excelsior Recordings]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.excelsior-recordings.com/artists/spinvis/|title=Spinvis|publisher=Excelsior Recordings|accessdate=24 October 2010}}</ref> Within two weeks, a record deal was signed. The label decided to keep the songs that had been recorded by Spinvis on his home computer. With some minor mixing touch-ups these songs comprised Spinvis' first album, released in the Netherlands on 1 April 2002. The music press responded with positive reviews and the album reached number one in ''[[Oor]]'' magazine's [[Moordlijst]], an alternative chart in the Netherlands.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

De Jong began touring, and played at the ''[[Crossing Border Festival]]'' in [[Amsterdam]] with [[Toots Thielemans]]. He at the end of 2002, Spinvis' song "Smalfilm" was second in the [[VPRO]]'s Song of the Year 2002 contest.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  In addition to this De Jong received an Essent Award, a prize for breakthrough artists.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Spinvis and his ensemble completed a brief tour in early 2003. With labelmates [[Bauer (Dutch band)|Bauer]], De Jong created a track for a Dutch music webzine compilation. In August, Spinvis performed in Germany (Haldern Open Air) and Belgium ([[Pukkelpop]]). On 1 December, "Nieuwegein aan Zee" was released, containing a live registration and a number of unreleased tracks. On 17 December, Spinvis performed with an orchestra in Vredenburg, [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]].

In early 2004, Spinvis won two Dutch awards, the [[Silver Harp]] and the [[Annie M.G. Schmidt prize]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  In honour of the fourth edition of the Cross-Linx festival De Jong composed a musical piece that consists of three rhythmical monologues. Actress [[Roos Ouwehand]], opera singer [[Lucia Meeuwsen]] and actor [[Hans Dagelet]] performed the pieces together with Spinvis. For filmmaker [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]], Spinvis wrote the title song for the television series ''[[Medea (television series)|Medea]]''. This six-part series on Dutch politics was shown in the winter of 2004. In this busy year Spinvis also contributed to [[Claudia de Breij]]'s song "Nieuwbouwwijk".

===''Dagen van gras, dagen van stro''===
During the Noorderslag music festival, the Ringtone Society presented a website that promoted the artistic development of ringtones. Spinvis participated in this project. The song "Idee Zeventien" ('Idea Seventeen') appeared on the compilation ''The Pet Series: Volume 4''. During spring 2005, Spinvis Performed in Dutch theaters with his Lotus Europa tour. The band [[Solo (band)|Solo]] played as support act. In April, Spinvis created a theatrical show in which he mixed stock footage with music and dialogue. Together with Hans Dagelet, Spinvis performed the piece. On 11 September, Spinvis' performance at the Dutch Moroccan Music Experience was cancelled because the organisers objected to the lyrics of the song "Het Mes van God" ('The Dagger of God'). The song's lyrics were considered too sensitive as Spinvis refers to Theo van Gogh's assassination in November 2004. Spinvis made a guest appearance on the album ''Geluiden van Weleer'' of the band, [[at the close of every day]]. In November, his own album ''Dagen van gras, dagen van stro'' was released. The album's title is a translation of ''Days of Grass, Days of Straw'', a book by [[Raphael Aloysius Lafferty|R.A. Lafferty]] from 1973. The first single from the album was "Het Voordeel van Video" (The Advantage of Video). In December, Spinvis began a tour in support of the album.

The second single was "Ik wil alleen maar zwemmen" (I just want to swim). De Jong created a new mix for the song and also added a dub version to the release. The song "Voor ik vergeet" (Before I forget) became part of ''Strips in Stereo''. For this project, visual artists drew comics based on 14 Dutch songs. Hanco Kolk drew the graphics for Spinvis' song. ''Strips in Stereo'' was presented in [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]], [[Amsterdam]], in March, in conjunction with [[Boekenweek|Boekenweek 2006]] (the annual 'book week' where awards are awarded and writers meet during the 'book ball').

===''JA!''===
Together with [[Meindert Talma & the Negroes|Meindert Talma]], [[De Kift]], at the close of every day, [[Andre Manuel]], Mondo Leone and Dâ€™r Sjaak, Spinvis was part of the NL Impressionisten. In groups of two, the artists performed for a number of months throughout the Netherlands, starting on 18 March 2006. Two days later ''JA!'' was released, the 100th [[Excelsior Recordings]] release. Spinvis recorded it with poet [[Simon Vinkenoog]] and Arjan Witte (keys). The men played several dates in support of the album: [[Rotterdam]], [[Antwerp]], [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]] and [[Drachten]] were visited. Following this Spinvis and Vinkenoog wasted no time and performed the show ''De Suikerklok'' (The Sugar Clock). In the summer, Spinvis and his band performed at [[A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise|Lowlands]], Waterpop and [[Folk Dranouter]] amongst other festivals.
