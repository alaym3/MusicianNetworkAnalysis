'''Zap Mama''' is the music act of Belgian artist [[Marie Daulne]]. Zap Mama sings [[polyphonic]] and afro-pop music, a harmonic music with a mixture of infused [[Music of Africa|African]] vocal techniques, urban, [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] with emphasis on voice.<ref name=PCOLIntermix>{{cite web|url=http://www.intermix.org.uk/music/music_01_daulne.asp |title=Marie Daulne Is Zap Mama. |website=Intermix.org.uk |access-date=2011-10-15}}</ref> The worldwide success of Zap Mama, and an ensemble of female [[polyphonic]] singers, inspired influences in American hip hop, nu-soul, [[jazz]] and elements of [[Pop music|pop]]. The evolving musical compositions created a diverse band of singers and musicians for Zap Mama.

"The voice is an instrument itself," says Daulne. "It's the original instrument. The primary instrument. The most soulful instrument, the human voice. Singing songs in [[French language|French]] and English with African World Music Roots."<ref name=PCOLMetroactive>{{cite web|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/cruz/07.30.03/zap-mama-0331.html |title="Zap Happy" by Mike Conner.

==Sources of Zap Mama's music==
Sources of Zap Mama's music include Daulne's roots in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], her upbringing in Belgium, and her return to Africa to rediscover her musical roots.

===Democratic Republic of Congo===
Marie Daulne, the daughter of a Belgian father and a Congolese mother, was born in the East Zaire City of [[Isiro]].<ref name=PCOLRootsworld/> Marie had only been born a few days when her father was killed by the [[Simba Rebellion|Simba rebels]], during the [[Congo crisis|Congo Crisis]].<ref name=PCOLIntermix/> The Crisis resulted in the deaths of some 100,000 people. It led to the assassination of Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, as well as a traumatic setback to the United Nations, following the death of UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld in a plane crash as he sought to mediate.<ref name=PCOLNorthcoast>{{cite web |url=http://www.northcoastjournal.com/083007/hum0830.html |title="The Way Home" by Bob Boran.

===Belgium===
Growing up in Belgium was not easy for the family.<ref name=PCOLthere />  "There were few black people in Belgium," says Daulne. "It became easier as I grew older". There were black role models seen in music and sports. In the home, the Congolese culture remained present through traditional songs, which her mother and sisters sang together. The loving paternal family of Marie's Belgian father, provided liturgical music and the Walloon popular songs.<ref name=PCOLthere>{{cite web|url=http://btheremag.com/2007/10/01/qa-11/ |title=There! the Inflight Magazine of Brussels Airlines. "Q & A with Marie Daulne" October 1, 2007 |website=Btheremag.com |access-date=2011-10-15}}</ref> From early adolescence, Marie trained and competed in track, field and volleyball with athletic aspirations to one day compete in the International Olympics. .<ref name=PCOLBarnesandnoble /> Marie is a graduate of the [[Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts|Academie Royale des Beaux Arts de Bruxelles]] and the Nationale Superieure des Arts Visuales de La Cambre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacambre.be/ |title=La Cambre |access-date=2016-04-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128230159/http://www.lacambre.be/ |archive-date=January 28, 2013 }}</ref>  Daulne also trained in modern dance, choreography and acrobatics at the [[École nationale de cirque|Ecole du Cirque]], and briefly attended the Antwerp School of Jazz.

Although Daulne remembers that her mother sang some songs from Congo Kinshasa around the house, her mother did not teach them to the children, stressing mastery of French instead.<ref name=PCOLRootsworld /> Daulne listened to European music as she grew up.<ref name=PCOLBarnesandnoble/> "We had the radio when I was growing up in Belgium, so we heard a lot of French music. And of course, American music was also very popular all over Europe. Since our mother did not want us to watch TV in our home, we entertained ourselves by creating our own music. We were very musical."<ref name=PCOLZapwelcome /> Daulne was introduced to black music watching television.<ref name=PCOLBarnesandnoble /> "When I was growing up, there weren't many black people in Europe -- my family was alone. Then I saw an American musical comedy with black people on TV. And I couldn't believe it. I said, "That's us!" My whole fantasy life was based on that movie."<ref name=PCOLBarnesandnoble>{{cite web |url=http://music.barnesandnoble.com/features/interview.asp?z=y&NID=133018 |title=Urban Beats and Forest Chants Harmonize in Zap Mama's A MA ZONE. |website=Music.barnesandnoble.com |date=2011-07-19 |access-date=2011-10-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214002621/http://music.barnesandnoble.com/features/interview.asp?z=y&NID=133018 |archive-date=2012-02-14 }}</ref> Daulne felt a special connection to blues songs like "[[Seven Year Itch (Etta James album)|Damn Your Eyes]]" by [[Etta James]].<ref name=PCOLDenver /> "When I was a teenager I listened to a lot of American blues," she says.<ref name=PCOLDenver /> "That song brought me happiness while I was going through the pain of a broken love. It helped me to open the door and see the life in front of me. I sing it now and I hope, in my turn, that I can help another teenager to do the same if they are having pain from love."<ref name=PCOLDenver />

When Daulne was 14 she went to England and first heard [[reggae]].<ref name=PCOLBarnesandnoble /> "I discovered [[Bob Marley]] -- my favorite album was ''[[Kaya (album)|Kaya]]''. I know that whole album by heart."<ref name=PCOLBarnesandnoble /> Then Daulne became interested in the rap music of [[Run-DMC]] and the [[Beastie Boys]].<ref name=PCOLBarnesandnoble /> "I was into breakdancing at the time. I formed a gang, and we would beatbox like the Americans, like the [[Fat Boys]]."<ref name=PCOLBarnesandnoble />

After Daulne left home she remembered the African songs her mother sang to her as a child.<ref name=PCOLIndependent /> "When I left home, I missed those songs, and in the school choir, I wondered why we didn't use African harmonising. So my sister and I started to sing African melodies, and Zap Mama was born. I wrote my first song at 15, and my artist friend Nina said that what we were doing was amazing. She helped me to find a gig, and from that day, it has been non-stop."<ref name=PCOLIndependent>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/zap-mama-the-second-coming-of-zap-mama-542949.html|title=The second coming of Zap Mama|first=Phil|last=Meadley|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=2004-10-07|access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref> But Daulne didn't really get interested in singing until an accident left her unable to participate in athletics.<ref name=PCOLBarnesandnoble /> "I wanted to be a runner, but then I broke my leg and I was finished with sports. I stayed at home, listening to music. I was recording sounds all the time -- I would listen to sounds repeating for hours. But there was something that I needed still, and that's when I decided to go to Africa, to the forest."<ref name=PCOLBarnesandnoble />

===Return to Africa===
In the documentary film ''Mizike Mama'', Daulne and her family recall a reverse cultural tug-of-war for her allegiance during her childhood.<ref name=PCOLNYT /> Her mother feared that Daulne would grow up too African and so did not teach her tribal songs.<ref name=PCOLNYT /> However the Belgian side of her family encouraged Daulne to explore her African heritage.<ref name=PCOLNYT>New York Times. "Djembefola."

Not at all. But I was there, and I was standing in the middle of the forest, hearing the music that had been a part of my earliest memories, and it was like an illumination, like a light," Daulne said.<ref name=PCOLZapwelcome>[http://www.zapmama.org/welcome.html Zap Mama.

I started where I was born, in the forest of Zaire. After that I branched out to West Africa, South Africa, East Africa. It [is] very easy for me to learn because all African cultures seem to have something in common the music and the voices," Daulne says.<ref name=PCOLRootsworld /> Although Daulne draws inspiration from Africa, she does not call Africa home.<ref name=PCOLNorthcoast /> "You know when I went back to Congo, I thought I would have a welcome like I was part of the family, part of the country, but that was not the case," Daulne said.<ref name=PCOLNorthcoast /> "They treated me like a Belgian come to visit as a tourist. I saw that that is not especially a place to call home."<ref name=PCOLNorthcoast />

[[Image:Marie Daulne 3.jpg|thumb|left|Marie Daulne, the founder and leader of Zap Mama, says her mission is to be a bridge between the European and the African and bring the two cultures together with her music. Daulne specializes in polyphonic, harmonic music with a mixture of heavily infused [[Music of Africa|African]] instruments, [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], and [[Hip Hop music|Hip-hop]]. Daulne emphasizes voice in all her music, as she says "the voice is an instrument itself."<ref name=PCOLIntermix />]]
Daulne's music has evolved over the years from an [[a cappella]] quintet to a lead voice accompanied by instruments.<ref name=PCOLProvidence /> "I’m a nomad. I like to discover my sound with different instruments, different genres. For me it’s normal. My name is Zap Mama...it’s easy for me to zap in from one instrument to another, a culture, a style. I’m more a citizen of the world, not an American or Belgian."<ref name=PCOLProvidence>{{cite web|author=Rick MassimoJournal Pop Music Writer |url=http://www.projo.com/music/content/wk-ZAP_MAMA_08-09-07_QB6GK89.1f8d180.html |title=The Providence Journal.

August 9, 2007 |website=Projo.com |date=2007-08-09 |access-date=2011-10-15}}</ref> Zap Mama has released seven full-length albums: ''Zap Mama'' (1991) (re-released in 1993 as ''Adventures in Afropea 1'', minus the single track ''Etupe''), ''Sabsylma'' (1994), ''Seven'' (1997), ''A Ma Zone'' (1999), ''Ancestry in Progress'' (2004), ''Supermoon'' (2007), and ''ReCreation'' (2009) that fall into four cycles.<ref name=PCOLZapwelcome />

===First Cycle: ''Adventures in Afropea 1'' and ''Sabsylma''===
When Daulne returned to Belgium, she spent several years singing in Brussels in jazz cafes. In 1989, she founded the group Zap Mama to merge the African and European aspects of her identity.<ref name=PCOLSingers>{{cite web |url=http://www.singers.com/Zapmama.html |title=Zap Mama. |website=Singers.com |access-date=2011-10-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927043427/http://www.singers.com/Zapmama.html |archive-date=2011-09-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Daulne auditioned scores of female singers looking for the right combination of voices for an a cappella ensemble.<ref name=PCOLMinneapolis/>  "When I did my first album, I was looking for girls that were the same mix as me--African and European," she says.<ref name=PCOLDenver /> "I wanted to put these two sounds together to prove that to have blood from white and black was perfect harmony on the inside."<ref name=PCOLDenver>{{cite web|last=Solomon |first=Jon |url=http://www.westword.com/1997-08-21/music/mama-knows-best/ |title=Denver Westword. "Mama Knows Best" by Linda Gruno. August 21, 1997 |website=Westword.com |date=1997-08-21 |access-date=2011-10-15}}</ref> The five vocalists— Marie Daulne, her sister Anita Daulne, Sylvie Nawasadio, Sabine Kabongo, Angelique Willkie (who else? Céline T'hooft?) --combined the sounds of Congolese [[Pygmy peoples|Pygmies]] with vocal styles of European choral traditions.<ref name=PCOLSingers /> The original idea of Zap Mama was "five singers who would be one," Marie Daulne said.<ref name=PCOLSandiego /> "There is no chief."<ref name=PCOLSandiego>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sdcitybeat.com/article.php?id=6077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927110313/http://www.sdcitybeat.com/article.php?id=6077|url-status=dead|title=San Diego City beat.  "Superswoon: Zap Mama has to be seen to be believed in" by Troy Johnson  August 15, 2007.|archive-date=September 27, 2007}}</ref> "The power of voices was my thing," Daulne said.<ref name=PCOLMinneapolis/> "I wanted to show the world the capacity of five women exploring...our voices and our minds, nothing else."<ref name=PCOLMinneapolis/>

Zap Mama performed their first concert in 1989.<ref name=PCOLSingers /> In 1991, the group recorded their first record, ''Zap Mama'', at Studio Daylight in Brussels, Belgium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/6320064/a/Adventures+In+Afropea+1.htm |title=Adventures in Afropea 1. |website=Cduniverse.com |date=2005-02-08 |access-date=2011-10-15}}</ref> The album was released by [[Crammed Discs]], the Belgian record label of [[Marc Hollander]] and [[Vincent Kenis]] (who produced the album).<ref name=PCOLBelgium>{{cite web|url=http://houbi.com/belpop/groups/zapmama.htm |title=The Belgium Pop and Rock Archives. "Zap Mama." |website=Houbi.com |access-date=2011-10-15}}</ref>  In 1992, Zap Mama came to the United States for the first time to perform at New Music Seminar in New York. There, they met [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]] and agreed to let him reissue Zap Mama's first recordings as ''Adventures in Afropea 1''<ref name=PCOLZapwelcome /> on [[Luaka Bop Records]].<ref name=PCOLSandiego /> By the end of the year, [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] announced it was the top seller for "world music."<ref name=PCOLSandiego />  Zap Mama went on tour, playing New York's Central Park, Paris' [[Olympia (Paris)|Olympia]], the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]].<ref name=PCOLBelgium /> After the success of ''Adventures in Afropea 1'', Zap Mama split from Luaka Bop Records over artistic difference. According to Daulne, the record company "wanted to mold us into a poppy girl band, but I said, 'No, you'll kill me', and I stopped. Everyone was asking why I wanted to stop when we'd finally arrived at the top. But I felt that it was completely wrong. I wasn't ready. I wasn't strong enough. The manager said that if I stopped then, I'd be killing my career, but it was my decision."<ref name=PCOLIndependent />

The next album ''[[Sabsylma]]'' ([[Crammed Discs]], 1994) featured Indian, Moroccan, and Australian influences<ref name=PCOLSingers /> and earned Zap Mama a Grammy nomination for Best World Music Album.<ref name=PCOLZapwelcome /> Daulne explained that the sharper sound of ''Sabsylma'' was due to the increasing influence of American music, as a result of being on the road.<ref name=PCOLBelgium /> "We've been touring so intensively. ''Adventures in Afropea 1'' was a soft, African record with a natural, round sound. ''Sabsylma'' is hectic, sharper. Not on purpose, mind you. I can't help it. If you're driving in a van for months, and you constantly hear the sounds of traffic, TV, hard rock on the radio ... those sounds hook up in your ears, and come out if you start to sing."<ref name=PCOLBelgium />

In the studio, Daulne used an organic process of improvisation to create her music.<ref name=PCOLBelgium /> "I'm always looking for sounds. Most of the time, I work with colors. Each sound needs different colors of voices. I dissect sounds, cut them in little pieces, order them, and reassemble them," says Daulne.<ref name=PCOLBelgium /> "During the rehearsals, we light some candles, start a tape-recorder, close our eyes, and start making up a story. On that, we start adding sounds. We let ourselves go. We are carried away by the music."<ref name=PCOLBelgium />

While Zap Mama worked on ''Sabsylma'' in the studio, Director Violaine de Villers made a documentary, ''Mizike Mama'' (1993), presenting a portrait of the group.<ref name=PCOLNYT /> The film focuses on Daulne as the driving force behind the group and discusses the implications of membership in a racially mixed group that consciously fuses African rhythms and vocal tones with European polyphony.<ref name=PCOLNYT />

===Second Cycle: ''Seven'' and ''A Ma Zone''===
After the success of the first two albums, Daulne put her career on hold for a few years to birth and mother her daughter Kesia. Upon returning to her music, Daulne moved in a new direction. She chose to record ''[[7 (Zap Mama album)|Seven]]'' as the sole remaining member of the original Zap Mama. Her music had evolved stylistically as well. ''Adventures in Afropea 1'' and ''Sabsylma'' had both been largely a cappella,<ref name=PCOLRootsworld /> but ''Seven'' broke with the past by including male musicians and vocalists, an increased number of instruments, and more songs in English.<ref name=PCOLRootsworld /> "I'm looking for instruments that have vocal sounds, forgotten instruments like the [[guimbri]]... The first and second albums were about the voice, what came before. This album is about introducing those sounds into modern, Western life," says Daulne.<ref name=PCOLSingers /> The title of ''Seven'' (1997)<ref name=PCOLZapwelcome /> refers to the seven senses of a human being.<ref name=PCOLSingers /> When Daulne traveled to Mali in 1996, she had learned the Malian belief that in addition to the five senses known in the West, some have a sixth sense of emotion.<ref name=PCOLSingers /> "But not everyone has the seventh. It is the power to heal with music, calm with color, to soothe the sick soul with harmony. [The man who taught me about this belief] told me that I have this gift, and I know what I have to do with it," Daulne says.<ref name=PCOLBelgium />

Daulne's next album was ''[[A Ma Zone]]'' (1999).<ref name=PCOLZapwelcome /> The title is a wordplay meaning both "Amazone," the female warrior, and "A Ma Zone," (in my zone)<ref name=PCOLBelgium />  which "means that I feel at ease wherever I am," Daulne says.<ref name=PCOLZapwelcome /> "Naturally an Amazon is a rebel, a fighter who, once she has set her heart on something, pulls out all the stops to achieve her goal. I feel this way as well when I'm standing on the stage with the group-- as a team we share the same aim of winning over the audience with our music," Daulne says.<ref name=PCOLZapwelcome /> That same year, Zap Mama made "[[Iko Iko|Iko-Iko]]" for ''[[Mission: Impossible 2]]'' soundtrack, a cover of "Jock-A-Mo" by Sugar Boy & the Cane Cutters.

===Third Cycle: ''Ancestry in Progress'' and ''Supermoon''===
[[Image:Zap Mama in Seattle 2.jpg|thumb|Daulne (center) performs with Zap Mama at Bumbershoot 2007 in Seattle on September 3, 2007]]
Daulne moved to New York in 2000.<ref name=PCOLSandiego /> "I've never been welcome in any country as my own country," says Daulne.<ref name=PCOLSandiego /> "In Europe, they talk to me as if I'm from Congo. In Congo, they act like I'm from Europe. The first time I felt at home was in New York. I said, ‘Here is my country. Everybody is from somewhere else. I feel so comfortable here.'"<ref name=PCOLSandiego />

''[[Ancestry in Progress]]'' (2004) reflects Daulne's new life in the United States, as it synthesizes her traditional African and European influences with American musical styles like hip-hop and R&B.<ref name=PCOLZapwelcome /> "The American beat is a revolution all over the world," Daulne says.<ref name=PCOLZapwelcome /> "Everybody listens to it and everybody follows it. But the beat of the United States was inspired by the beat coming from Africa. Not just its structure, but the sound of it. This is the source of modern sounds, the history of the beat, starting from little pieces of wood banging against one another, and arriving on the big sound-systems today. It's genius. So I wanted to create an album about the evolution of old ancestral vocal sounds, how they traveled from Africa, mixing with European and Asian sounds, and were brought to America."<ref name=PCOLZapwelcome /> ''Ancestry in Progress'' (2004) reached #1 on the Billboard World Music Album chart.<ref name=PCOLConcord>{{cite web|url=http://www.concordmusicgroup.com/artists/Zap-Mama/ |title=Concord Music Group. "About Zap Mama." |website=Concordmusicgroup.com |access-date=2011-10-15}}</ref> A music video for the single "Bandy Bandy," featuring [[Erykah Badu]], directed by Bill Fishman and produced by David Herrera (music video director), aired on VH1.

After four years in the United States, Daulne moved back to Belgium<ref name=PCOLPrimary>{{cite web|url=http://www.primary.uk.com/primary/News_2004/primary_sep2004.html |title=Primary News: "New Signing - Zap Mama." September, 2004 |website=Primary.uk.com |access-date=2011-10-15}}</ref> and now calls Brussels home.<ref name=PCOLthere /> "I lived in the United States from 2000 to 2004 and it is a place with so many stars. When I met a lot of big celebrities I realized I was not a big star and that I didn't want to be, because your life would be a habit, stuck in this and that. I prefer the singularity. I prefer to be me."<ref name=PCOLMinneapolis>{{cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/music/story/1493230.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130203012755/http://www.startribune.com/music/story/1493230.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-02-03 |title=Minneapolis Star Tribune.

In my band, there are a lot of young musicians who teach me completely new things. They challenge me - and that is the way I like it," Daulne says.<ref name=PCOLPrimary />

In ''Supermoon'' (2007),<ref name=PCOLZapwelcome /> Daulne's vocals take center stage.<ref name=PCOLSandiego /> "When the audience appreciates the art of the artist, the audience becomes the sun and makes the artist shine as a full moon," says Daulne.<ref name=PCOLSandiego /> ''Supermoon'' is also one of Daulne's most personal statements<ref name=PCOLConcord /> with songs like "Princess Kesia," an ode to her daughter and a reflection on her growth. "With Supermoon, I reveal the way I chose to live when I started my career,” says Daulne.<ref name=PCOLConcord /> “It’s very intimate…You’re seeing me very close up. I hope that’s a kind of intimacy that people will understand. I’m opening a door to who I am."<ref name=PCOLConcord /> "I always used to hide myself, and I'm not complaining about it, but now it is time to show my eyes and my femininity and my delicate side," said Daulne.<ref name=PCOLMinneapolis/> "I am proud to be so feminine, because I have taken the time to develop...my femininity. Now that I have that, I can face anybody. And if anybody challenges me, there is no problem."<ref name=PCOLMinneapolis/>

===Fourth Cycle: ''ReCreation''===
In 2009, Zap Mama released her latest album, ''ReCreation'', which celebrates her tradition of worldwide influences and expresses her new attitude toward her life and music. Daulne describes the inspiration behind the album as her realization that she was learning and experiencing "something new all the time."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/v/GwhCiFuhD_o&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp; |title=Zap Mama Last FM interview |publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=2011-10-15}}</ref> The album's title refers to recreation in two senses of the world, both as a renewal of the self and as pleasurable relaxation and enjoyment. Almost every song on the album features a collaboration with another artist, including [[G. Love]], [[Vincent Cassel]], and [[Bilal (American singer)|Bilal]]. ''ReCreation'' was nominated by the [[NAACP Image Awards]] for Outstanding World Music Album.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.naacpimageawards.net/41/nominees-and-voting/nominees/ |title=41st NAACP Image Awards Nominees |website=Naacpimageawards.net |date=2010-02-26 |access-date=2011-10-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208053658/http://www.naacpimageawards.net/41/nominees-and-voting/nominees/ |archive-date=2010-12-08 }}</ref>
