==Coat of arms==
Bakar was granted its coat of arms and [[town privileges]] in 1799 by Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]]. The coat of arms was in the artistic style typical for the period, with a [[cartouche]] with large landscapes and ornamentation around the shield within a circular inscription.

The shield of the coat of arms features a red-and-white checkered top or "chief", with three local gray stone castles on green hills in the middle, and a black anchor on orange at the bottom.

After WWI, from the end of 1920, Bakar was one of the major points of entry of thousands of [[Russians in Croatia|Russian refugees]], arriving in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of SHS]] following the end of the [[Russian Civil War]] in the European part of the former [[Russian Empire]], mostly from [[Crimea]], after the final defeat of White armies under general [[Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel|Wrangel]] there in November 1920.

===World War II===
During WW II, in Bakar was an [[Italian concentration camp]], where civil population from [[Province of Ljubljana]],<ref>[http://rememberingfascistcamps.blogspot.com/2013/07/her-internment-began-in-bakar-croatia.html Ivanka Zamida: a survivor's testimonial], from 2013 exhibition "The Last Witnesses", National Museum for Contemporary History, [[Ljubljana]]</ref> as well as Croats and Serbs was interned. It the peak, there was 893 internees.<ref>[http://www.campifascisti.it/scheda_campo.php?id_campo=145 Bakar concentration camp], Online Research project</ref>
