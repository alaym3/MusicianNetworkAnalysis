'''Eva Marie Cassidy''' (February 2, 1963&nbsp;– November 2, 1996) was an American singer and guitarist known for her interpretations of [[jazz]], [[Folk music|folk]], and [[blues]] music, sung with a powerful, emotive [[soprano]] voice. In 1992, she released her first album, ''[[The Other Side (Eva Cassidy album)|The Other Side]]'', a set of duets with [[go-go]] musician [[Chuck Brown]], followed by the 1996 live solo album titled ''[[Live at Blues Alley]]''. Although she had been honored by the [[Washington Area Music Association]], she was virtually unknown outside her native Washington, D.C. She died of [[melanoma]] in 1996 at the age of 33.

Two years after her death, Cassidy's music was brought to the attention of British audiences, when her versions of "[[Fields of Gold]]" and "[[Over the Rainbow]]" were played by [[Mike Harding]] and [[Terry Wogan]] on [[BBC Radio 2]]. Following the overwhelming response, a camcorder recording of "Over the Rainbow", taken at [[Blues Alley]] in Washington by her friend Bryan McCulley, was shown on [[BBC Two]]'s ''[[Top of the Pops 2]]''. Shortly afterwards, the compilation album ''[[Songbird (Eva Cassidy album)|Songbird]]'' climbed to the top of the [[UK Albums Chart]], almost three years after its initial release. The chart success in the United Kingdom and Ireland led to increased recognition worldwide. Her [[List of works published posthumously|posthumously]] released recordings, including three number-one albums and one number-one single in the UK, have sold more than ten million copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hangout.altsounds.com/news/127691-blix-street-records-celebrates-10th-anniversary-of-eva-cassidys-songbird.html |title=Blix Stree Records Celebrates 10th Anniversary of Eva Cassidy's 'Songbird' CD Reaching number 1 on U.K. Music Chart with Gold Certification of New 'Simply Eva' Acoustic CD |website=AltSounds.com |access-date=March 23, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110325105145/http://hangout.altsounds.com/news/127691-blix-street-records-celebrates-10th-anniversary-of-eva-cassidys-songbird.html |archive-date=March 25, 2011}}</ref> Her music has also charted within the top 10 in Australia, Germany, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.<ref name= wordmag />

==Early life==
Born on February 2, 1963, at the [[Washington Hospital Center]] in Washington, D.C.,<ref>[[#knew|Burley et al.]] p. 13.</ref> Cassidy grew up in [[Oxon Hill, Maryland]], and later [[Bowie, Maryland]]. She was the third of four children. Her father, [[Hugh Cassidy]], is a teacher, sculptor, musician, former army medic, and world champion [[powerlifter]] of Irish and [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent, while her mother, Barbara (''née'' Kratzer), is a German [[horticulturist]] from [[Bad Kreuznach]].<ref name= wordmag>[http://www.evacassidy.org/eva/wordmagazine.pdf The Afterlife of Eva Cassidy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922090245/http://www.evacassidy.org/eva/wordmagazine.pdf |date=September 22, 2014 }} (PDF) Dorian Lynske, ''Word Magazine'', 2003.

When she was nine, her father began teaching her to play the guitar, and she began to play and sing at family gatherings.<ref name= washingtonian />

At age 11, Cassidy began singing and playing guitar in a Washington-area band called Easy Street.<ref>[[#knew|Burley et al.]] pp. 54–56.</ref> This band performed in a variety of styles at weddings, corporate parties, and pubs. Due to her shyness, she struggled with performing in front of strangers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Eva Cassidy: Bitter-sweet songbird |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1199166.stm |access-date=May 2, 2020 |agency=BBC}}</ref> While a student at [[Bowie High School (Maryland)|Bowie High School]], she sang with a local band called Stonehenge.<ref name= washingtonian /> During the summer of 1983, Cassidy sang and played guitar six days a week at the theme park [[Six Flags America|Wild World]].<ref name= washingtonian /> Her younger brother Dan, a [[fiddle]]r, was also a member of this working band.

Throughout the 1980s, Cassidy worked with several other bands, including the techno-pop band Characters Without Names. During this period, she also worked as a propagator at a plant nursery and as a furniture painter. In her free time, she explored other artistic expressions including painting, sculpting, and jewelry design.<ref name= liner />

==Music career==
In 1986, Cassidy was asked by Stonehenge guitarist and high school friend, David Lourim, to lend her voice to his music project, [[Method Actor]].<ref>[[#knew|Burley et al.]] p.64.</ref> This brought her to Black Pond Studios, where she met recording engineer and bassist Chris Biondo. Biondo helped her find work as a [[session musician|session singer]] and later introduced her to Al Dale, who would become her manager. She sang back-ups for various acts, from [[go-go]] [[rhythm and blues]] band [[Experience Unlimited]] to [[rapping|rapper]] [[E-40]].<ref name= chuckeva>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/music/features/1browncassidy0309.htm When Chuck Met Eva] Jefferson Morley, ''The Washington Post'', March 8, 1998.

In 1992, Biondo played a tape of Cassidy's voice for [[Chuck Brown]], the "Godfather of go-go".<ref name= echoes /> It resulted in the duet album ''[[The Other Side (Eva Cassidy album)|The Other Side]]'' featuring performances of classic songs such as "[[Fever (1956 song)|Fever]]", "[[God Bless the Child (Billie Holiday song)|God Bless the Child]]," and what would later become Cassidy's [[signature song]], "[[Over the Rainbow]]". The album was released and distributed in 1992 by Liaison Records, the label that also released Brown's Go-go albums. Brown originally intended to record an additional duet with Cassidy for his next solo album, but this was postponed due to ongoing negotiations between Dale and other labels for a solo deal.<ref name= chuckeva /><ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.evacassidy.org/eva/citypaper.htm |title= Side by Side| url-status= dead| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070610065925/http://evacassidy.org/eva/citypaper.htm |archive-date=June 10, 2007 |first= Alona |last= Wartofsky| work= [[Washington City Paper]]| date= November 20, 1992| access-date= November 2, 2016}}</ref> Cassidy's unwillingness to narrow her stylistic focus to one genre hindered her chances of securing a deal.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,105719,00.html | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121023075745/http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,105719,00.html | url-status= dead | archive-date= October 23, 2012 |title= Over the Rainbow| first= Jeff |last= Chu| website=Time.com| date= April 9, 2001| access-date= March 6, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.crosstownarts.com/CrosstownArts/client_music/eva/gift.html| title= Eva Cassidy's Gift| first= Joan| last= Anderman| work=[[The Boston Globe]]| date= January 31, 1999| access-date= March 6, 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080102024455/http://www.crosstownarts.com/CrosstownArts/client_music/eva/gift.html| archive-date= January 2, 2008| url-status= dead}}</ref> After talks broke down, the two decided to record their own duet album.

In 1993, Cassidy was honored by the Washington Area Music Association with a Wammie award for the ''Vocalist Jazz/Traditional'' category.<ref name= wammie>[http://www.wamadc.com/wama/wammies/WAMI-abc-e-g.htm Wammie Winners] Washington Area Music Association.

She sang two tracks in a mainly instrumental album. It was a musically unsatisfying experience for her.<ref name= chuckeva />

After having a potential contract with Apollo Records collapse when the label went bankrupt, Biondo and Dale decided that she should release her own live album.<ref name= chuckeva /> On January 2–3, 1996, the material for ''[[Live at Blues Alley]]'' was recorded at [[Blues Alley]] in Washington, D.C.

(The complete set of 31 songs recorded that night was eventually released 20 years later as ''[[Nightbird (Eva Cassidy album)|Nightbird]]'' in 2015.) Unhappy with the way she sounded due to a cold, she was reluctant to release the album.

==Death==
In 1993, Cassidy had a malignant [[Nevus|mole]] removed from her back. Three years later, during a promotional event for the ''Live at Blues Alley'' album in July 1996, Cassidy noticed an ache in her hips, which she attributed to stiffness from painting [[mural]]s while perched atop a stepladder.<ref name= echoes /> The pain persisted and [[X-ray]]s revealed a fracture.

Additional chemotherapy was ineffective, and Cassidy died on November 2, 1996 of melanoma, at her family's home in [[Bowie, Maryland]].<ref name= wordmag /><ref name= echoes /><ref name= grabs>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05EEDC133AF931A2575BC0A9649C8B63 |title=In Death, A Shy Singer Finally Grabs The Spotlight; CD's Carry Eva Cassidy's Voice a Wider Audience |first=Alex |last=Ward |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 12, 2002 |access-date=June 3, 2008}}</ref> In accordance with her wishes, her body was cremated and the ashes were scattered on the lake shores of [[St. Mary's River Watershed Park]], a nature reserve near [[Callaway, Maryland]].<ref name= wordmag />

==Posthumous recognition==
After Cassidy's death, local folk singer [[Grace Griffith]] introduced the Blues Alley recording to Bill Straw from her label, Blix Street Records.<ref name= grabs /> Straw approached the Cassidy family to put together a new album. In 1998, a compilation of tracks from Cassidy's three released recordings was assembled into the CD ''[[Songbird (Eva Cassidy album)|Songbird]]''. This CD lingered in relative obscurity for two years until being given airplay by [[Terry Wogan]] on his wide-reaching [[BBC Radio 2]] show ''[[Wake Up to Wogan]]'', following recommendation by his producer [[Paul Walters]]. The album sold more than 100,000&nbsp;copies in the following months.<ref name= wordmag /> ''[[The New York Times]]'' spoke of her "silken soprano voice with a wide and seemingly effortless range, unerring pitch and a gift for phrasing that at times was heart-stoppingly eloquent."<ref name= grabs />

In 2002, the self-titled 1988 album by the band [[Method Actor]], which featured Cassidy, was re-released by the band's guitarist and producer David Lourim with Cassidy's name displayed prominently on the cover. The Cassidy family and Blix Street Records filed a lawsuit against Lourim, claiming that Cassidy's name was used in a misleading fashion and that Blix Street has exclusive rights to her recordings.<ref>[http://www.mdd.uscourts.gov/Opinions152/Opinions/Cassidy031904.pdf ''Hugh Cassidy, et al. v.

A bootleg recording that has been in circulation is called ''Live at Pearl's''. It was recorded at Pearl's Restaurant in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], in 1994. Copies of the recording were circulated among friends and family after her death. Some of the songs on the recording are also on ''Imagine'' and ''American Tune''.<ref name="Q and A">[http://www.evacassidy.org/eva/q&a.shtml Q and A]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206004519/http://www.evacassidy.org/eva/q%26a.shtml |date=February 6, 2015 }} Evacassidy.org.</ref> Another recording from the early '90s, featuring [[Mick Fleetwood]] on drums and recorded at his restaurant (named Fleetwood's) in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], <!-- according to http://www.fleetwoodmac.net/penguin/mick.htm, the restaurant only operated between 1994 to 1996. --> was in the possession of writer/musician Niki Lee, the former wife of pianist Lenny Williams, 1988–1996. Lee discovered it in her garage and attempted to sell it on eBay in 2008 for 250,000 [[Pound sterling|pounds]] (around 491,249 [[USD]] at that time). She asserts that she converted the dollars to pounds incorrectly and was lambasted by Cassidy fans for her mistake.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2008/06/04/selling-eva-cassidy-by-the-pound/ |title=Selling Eva Cassidy by the Pound |first=Dave |last=McKenna |work=Washington City Paper blog |date=June 4, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626102055/http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2008/06/04/selling-eva-cassidy-by-the-pound/ |archive-date=June 26, 2015 }}</ref> On September 19, 2013, Lee donated Cassidy's lost recording, ''Eva Cassidy Live at Fleetwoods'', to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. The recording will remain in the museum's archives. Two other lost cassettes of Cassidy's recordings are being remastered for entrance.

To mark the 20th anniversary of the Blues Alley concert, Blix Street Records released ''[[Nightbird (Eva Cassidy album)|Nightbird]]'', a 32-track double CD album, in November 2015. ''Nightbird'' comprises the complete Blues Alley concert recordings, including eight previously unreleased songs, from the night of January 3, 1996. The European version of the CD package also includes a DVD including 12 video performances from the Blues Alley concert. ''Nightbird'' was also released as a four-LP vinyl package worldwide.{{citation needed|date= November 2016}}

==Legacy==
In 2001, ''Songbird: Eva Cassidy: Her Story By Those Who Knew Her'', a book on the life and work of Cassidy based on interviews with close family and associates, was released in the UK. A US edition published by [[Penguin Group|Gotham Books]] was released in late 2003 and includes two additional chapters on her influences and success in the US. Her life story has also been adapted into a musical<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.granthamjournal.co.uk/leisure/Musical-charts-life-of-songstress.3875566.jp| title= Musical charts life of songstress Eva Cassidy| work= Grantham Journal| date= March 13, 2008| access-date= March 17, 2008| archive-url= https://archive.today/20120801220345/http://www.granthamjournal.co.uk/leisure/Musical-charts-life-of-songstress.3875566.jp| archive-date= August 1, 2012| url-status= dead}}</ref> and also a [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] piece for cancer benefit.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.broadwayworld.com/viewcolumn.cfm?colid=2042| title= Eva Cassidy Remembered| first= Amanda| last= Scarpone| website= Broadwayworld.com| date= January 26, 2005 |access-date= November 2, 2016}}</ref>

A number of filmmakers have proposed films based on Cassidy's life, and have worked with her family to greater or lesser degrees, but to date these projects have not progressed past the early development stages. In late 2007, AIR Productions acquired the rights to produce a film based on Cassidy's life.<ref name= Greenbay>{{cite news| url= http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071125/GPG05/711250646/1261/GPG05 |title= SNC alumna, Sheboygan native receives leadership award| first= Warren| last= Gerds| work= [[Green Bay Press-Gazette]]| date= November 25, 2007| access-date= November 2, 2016}}{{dead link|date=May 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} [http://lauraschwartzlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Green-Bay-Press-Gazette-Warren-Gerds-column-SNC-alumna-Sheboygan-native-receives-leadership-award.pdf Alt URL]</ref> It is being produced by [[Amy Redford]] (daughter of actor/director [[Robert Redford]]), Irwin Shapiro and Rick Singer.<ref name= Greenbay /><ref name= AIR>{{cite web| url= https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117977583.html?categoryid=13&cs=1&nid=2562| title= Eva Cassidy biopic in the works| first= Michael| last= Fleming| work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]| date= December 7, 2007| access-date= March 6, 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071223112109/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117977583.html?categoryid=13&cs=1&nid=2562| archive-date= December 23, 2007| url-status= dead}}</ref> In an interview a year earlier, Cassidy's parents suggested [[Kirsten Dunst]] or [[Emily Watson]] as possible actresses who could play their daughter.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.nbc4.com/entertainment/10227265/detail.html| title= Local Singer's Career Takes Off After Death, Eva Cassidy's Story To Be Told In Hollywood| website= NBC4.com| date= November 2, 2006| access-date= March 6, 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080103201405/http://www.nbc4.com/entertainment/10227265/detail.html| archive-date= January 3, 2008| url-status= dead}}</ref>
