==Plot==
{{see also|List of We Bare Bears characters}}
''We Bare Bears'' follows three adoptive brother bears: Grizzly (often called Grizz), Panda (often called Pan-Pan), and Ice Bear. The bears attempt to integrate with human society, such as by purchasing food, making human companions or trying to become famous on the Internet, although these attempts see the bears struggle to do so due to the civilized nature of humans and their own animal instincts.<ref name=Annecy/> However, in the end, they figure out that they have each other for support.<ref name="Anon. 2014a">{{cite web|date=March 10, 2014|url=https://deadline.com/2014/03/cartoon-network-unveils-upfront-slate-for-2014-15-696377/|title=Cartoon Network Unveils Upfront Slate For 2014–15|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|access-date=December 22, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205212850/http://deadline.com/2014/03/cartoon-network-unveils-upfront-slate-for-2014-15-696377/|archive-date=December 5, 2014}}</ref>

The Bears often form a "bear stack", which they use to get around the city, and has become perhaps the most recognizable image from the show.<ref name="Annecy">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/markets-festivals/annecy-daniel-chong-we-bare-bears-1201520988/|title=Annecy: Daniel Chong on Cartoon Network's Big New Play, 'We Bare Bears' (EXCLUSIVE)}}</ref> Occasionally, the bears share adventures with their friends, such as child prodigy Chloe Park, [[bigfoot]] Charlie, internet sensation koala Nom Nom, park ranger Tabes, and produce saleswoman Lucy. Some flashback episodes chronicle the adventures of the bears as cubs trying to find a home.

The show was created by cartoonist Daniel Chong, who had previously worked as a story artist for [[Pixar]] and [[Illumination (company)|Illumination Entertainment]]. The show is based on his [[webcomic]] ''The Three Bare Bears'', which features the same characters.<ref name="avclub">{{Cite web|last=Johnson|first=Kevin|date=July 31, 2015|title=We Bare Bears: "Everyday Bears"|url=https://tv.avclub.com/we-bare-bears-everyday-bears-1798184508|access-date=December 4, 2020|website=TV Club|language=en-us}}</ref> This webcomic was uploaded online from 2010 to 2011,<ref name="Chong n.d.

Chong said that doing the comic helped a lot with the show, especially in providing the dynamic between the three main characters, though the characters have also evolved a lot from the comic.<ref name="animac">{{Cite web|last=Carande|first=Adrian|date=|title=Interview with Daniel Chong, creator of We Bare Bears — Animac|url=http://www.animac.cat/magazine_en/entrevista-amb-daniel-chong-creador-de-we-bare-bears|access-date=January 21, 2021|website=www.animac.cat|publisher=[[Animac]] Magazine}}</ref>

Billed as a comedy, the show is a production of [[Cartoon Network Studios]], which developed the program with Chong as part of their shorts development program. It was announced during the network's 2014 [[Upfront (advertising)|upfront]].<ref name="Anon. 2014a" /> According to Chong, much of the [[Television pilot|pilot]] was done with traditional watercolors, then digitally altered, to give "a naturalistic feel", but traditional work was not possible for a full show so he and the art director found a digital way to produce a "painterly feel", using references such as [[Peanuts]] cartoons, children's book illustrators like [[Tomi Ungerer]] and [[E. H. Shepard]], and ''[[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]''.<ref name="animac"/><ref>{{cite web|date=November 9, 2015|title=We Bare Bears – Interview with Daniel Chong, the Show Creator|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIP4ExcvK2k|access-date=September 12, 2017|publisher=Cartoon Network Australia|via=YouTube}}</ref>

Nom Nom and Charlie were initially voiced by [[Ken Jeong]] and [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]], respectively, before getting recast sometime before airing. Episodes, other than specials and shorts, were 11 minutes long.

According to Chong, fans responded positively to the human communities being ethnically diverse.<ref name="straitstimes"/> The Asian-American news site ''NextShark'' said that the show had gained popularity among Asian American communities because it "contains deeper messages of representation and belonging as a minority – something most Asian American children are far too familiar with." It noted that the show "unapologetically showcases and simultaneously normalizes Asian culture through their references to Panda’s love for K-pop and K-dramas, the Bears’ regular trips to their favorite boba shop, and Ice Bear's impressive ability to speak fluent Korean and cook traditional Korean dishes."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hyun|first=Jin|date=2019-01-18|title=From Boba to K-Pop: Why 'We Bare Bears' is So Relatable to Asians|url=https://nextshark.com/daniel-chong-we-bare-bears-interview/|access-date=January 21, 2021|website=NextShark|language=en-US}}</ref>

A reviewer for [[The A.V. Club|''The'' ''A.V. Club'']] was more mixed, saying in 2015 that the show "bounc[ed] between the extraordinary and the endearing," describing typical episodes as the bears "find[ing] themselves in some sort of bizarre yet generic conflict...with little background music, a more muted color palette, and a simpler vibe." Overall, ''The A.V. Club'' said it was "not a must-watch show by any means, but it’s charming and breezy enough to enjoy within its brief run-time."<ref name="avclub"/>

[[Den of Geek]] noted that the show embraced episodic storytelling, contrary to 90s and 2000s trends in kids' television, and felt that it "uses episodic storytelling to its full advantage and crafts adventures that are perfectly suited to the format." It noted that the show did have some light elements of serialization, including character growth.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kelley|first=Shamus|date=2017-08-25|title=We Bare Bears Does Episodic Cartoons Right|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/we-bare-bears-does-episodic-cartoons-right/|access-date=January 21, 2021 |website=Den of Geek }}</ref> [[Screen Rant]] said that the show was known for its 1990s pop culture references, such as depicting [[Charles Barkley]] magically appearing from a [[trading card]].<ref name="screenrant">{{Cite web|last=Armitage|first=Helen|date=2019-08-30|title=We Bare Bears Season 3 Finale Explained|url=https://screenrant.com/we-bare-bears-season-3-finale-explained/|access-date=January 21, 2021|website=ScreenRant|language=en-US}}</ref>

{{Main|We Bare Bears: The Movie}}
On May 30, 2019, Cartoon Network announced that ''[[We Bare Bears: The Movie]]'' would be released in mid-2020.<ref name="deadline"/> On May 21, 2020, the film was announced to be released digitally on June 30, 2020 and on Cartoon Network on September 7, 2020; it served as a conclusion to the narrative of the series.<ref name="BayArea" /> The movie was directed by Daniel Chong and features the same main voice actors as the TV show. The plot follows the three bear brothers Grizzly, Panda, and Ice Bear having to flee a [[Nuisance wildlife management|wildlife control]] agent by leaving the Bay Area and seeking refuge to [[Canada]]. Along the way, the Bears endure hardships while staying true to their promise of being "bros for life".

Covering the film for ''[[SF Weekly]]'', Grace Li summarized the film as "sweet and fun" and a perfect summation for four seasons of adventures. Though expressing regret over the series' unresolved story lines, she complimented its zany sense of humor and its ultimate message, which to her was that "you can always choose your family".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Li|first=Grace Z.|date=2020-07-03|title='We Bare Bears' Says Goodbye|url=https://www.sfweekly.com/film/we-bare-bears-says-goodbye/|access-date=January 22, 2021|website=SF Weekly }}</ref> Shamus Kelley of [[Den of Geek]] gave the film a five out-of five star rating and praised it as an excellent film; one that feels relevant without losing the fun that made the show a fan favorite. Commending the relationship of its main characters, whose fight against intolerance he said infuses every moment of the film with more power and relevance than any other story the show has done before.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kelley|first=Shamus|date=2020-06-30|title=We Bare Bears The Movie Reminds Us Of The Series' True Message|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/we-bare-bears-the-movie-reminds-us-of-the-series-true-message/|access-date=January 22, 2021|website=Den of Geek }}</ref> Rollin Bishop of ComicBook.com awarded the film a four out of five-star rating. Though describing it as poorly paced, he praised its decision to include the heavy themes, which were exacerbated by current events.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bishop|first=Rollin|date=June 29, 2020|title=We Bare Bears: The Movie Review: Home Sweet Bears|url=https://comicbook.com/movies/news/we-bare-bears-the-movie-review-home-sweet-bears/|access-date=January 22, 2021|website=Movies }}</ref>
