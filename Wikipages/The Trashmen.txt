The original line-up of the group featured guitarists Tony Andreason and Dal Winslow, bassist Bob Reed, and drummer Steve Wahrer.

Along with Colorado-based contemporaries [[The Astronauts (band)|the Astronauts]], The Trashmen have been described as "the premier landlocked Midwestern [[surf music|surf group]] of the '60s."<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=the-astronauts-mn0000753852 |tab=biography |pure_url=yes}} |title=The Astronauts Biography |first=Richie |last=Unterberger |author-link=Richie Unterberger |publisher=[[All Media Network]] |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=July 7, 2017}}</ref>  The band took their name from "Trashman's Blues", a song written and recorded in 1961 by Minneapolis musician Kai Ray (Richard Caire, 1935&ndash;2017), who later wrote songs for the band.<ref>[http://www.startribune.com/richard-caire-rock-n-roll-musician-dies-at-81/430582793/  Miguel Otárola, "Richard Caire, rock 'n' roll musician known as Kai-Ray, dies at 81", ''Star Tribune'', June 24, 2017].

== History ==
=== Pre-Trashmen ===
Tony Andreason and Mike Jann were friends who learned and played guitar together, starting in 1955. They primarily played country. In 1957, at the Crystal Coliseum, Tony and Mike met Steve Wahrer, a drummer, Dallas "Dal" Winslow, a guitar player, and a saxophone player. Tony, Steve, Dal, and the saxophone player played as The String Kings for a brief time period. Mike wasn't part of the group, due to being more interested in country music. Tony met Jim Thaxter through Steve and Dale. Jim was a singer who was looking to front a band. "Jim Thaxter and the Travelers" was then formed with the following line-up: Jim Thaxter on lead vocals and guitar (tuned to a bass guitar); Tony Andreason on lead guitar; Dal Winslow on rhythm guitar; Tom Diehl on piano; and Steve Wahrer on drums. In Spring 1961, the group took a break as Tony and Jim had to go into the military. In February or March 1962, the two returned. However, disagreements on musical direction between the two caused Tony to leave the band. Steve and Dal left with him.

=== Early Trashmen ===
Don Woody joined the group on bass. After Don's friend showed the group a record called "The Trashmen’s Blues", Steve decided to call the band "The Trashmen". The group was primarily an instrumental group, with occasional lead vocals by Steve. Steve began to sing more and more. Tony has occasionally sung lead. Don left the band and was replaced by Bob Reed, picked from an audition. The group gained an interest in surf rock after listening to [[Dick Dale]]. A song called "Surfin' Bird" was conceptualized by Steve and was instantly liked by their audience at shows.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Trashmen|url=https://minniepaulmusic.com/artists/t-to-z/trashmen/|access-date=2021-02-09|website=MinniePaulMusic.com|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== "Surfin' Bird" as first success ===
[[File:Trashman.jpg|thumbnail|Cover of the 1995 reissue of the album featuring the hit single]]
The Trashmen's biggest [[chart-topper|hit]] was 1963's "[[Surfin' Bird]]",<ref name="Music"/> which reached No.&nbsp;4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the latter part of that year. The song was a combination of two [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] hits by [[The Rivingtons]], "The Bird's the Word" and "[[Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow]]".<ref>{{cite news |title=Birdland Revisited |first=Peter S. |last=Scholtes |newspaper=[[City Pages]] |url=http://citypages.com/databank/19/932/article6243.asp |date=October 14, 1998 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010521005038/http://citypages.com/databank/19/932/article6243.asp |archive-date=May 21, 2001}}</ref> Early pressings of the single credit the Trashmen's drummer and vocalist Steve Wahrer as the composer, but following a threat from The Rivingtons' legal counsel, the writing credit was removed from Wahrer and transferred to the members of The Rivingtons.<ref>{{Discogs release|1717702|The Trashmen  – Surfin' Bird|type=single}}</ref>

The song was later covered by The [[Ramones]], [[The Cramps]], [[Silverchair]], The Psychotic Petunias, [[Paul Reubens|Pee-Wee Herman]], [[Equipe 84]], and the [[thrash metal]] band [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]]. It has also been featured in several films, including ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'', ''[[Fred Claus]]'', ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'', ''[[Back to the Beach]]'', and ''[[The Big Year]]''.

"Surfin' Bird" was the subject of the episode "[[I Dream of Jesus]]" of the television series ''[[Family Guy]]'', sending the song to No.&nbsp;8 on the [[iTunes]] Top 10 Rock songs chart and No.&nbsp;50 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 2009. The episode "[[Family Guy (season 18)|Rich Old Stewie]]" included the song played in slow motion.

In 2010, a Facebook campaign was launched to send the song to No.&nbsp;1 in the UK over the Christmas season; this was largely intended (as with [[Rage Against the Machine]]'s "[[Killing in the Name]]", in 2009) as a protest against the takeover of the Christmas No.&nbsp;1 spot by ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'' winner's song. The track debuted in the UK Top Ten for the first time on December 19, at No.&nbsp;3.

It was also featured in the video game ''[[Battlefield Vietnam]]''.

=== Continuing of music career ===
Beyond "Surfin' Bird", The Trashmen experienced limited success. In 1964, "Bird Dance Beat" reached No.&nbsp;30 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the United States<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=the-trashmen-mn0000007729 |tab=biography |pure_url=yes}} |title=The Trashmen Biography |first=Cub |last=Koda |author-link=Cub Koda |publisher=[[All Media Network]] |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=July 7, 2017}}</ref> and was a top 10 hit in Canada. The group disbanded in 1967. A four-CD [[box set]] of their work was released by [[Sundazed Records]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sundazed.com/p/1438-The-Trashmen-Bird-Call-The-Twin-City-Stomp-Of-The-Trashmen-4-CD-Set.aspx |title=The Trashmen – Bird Call |website=[[Sundazed Records]] |access-date=July 7, 2017}}</ref>

=== Reunion ===
The group made sporadic reunions in the 1970s and 1980s, performing together until Steve Wahrer died of throat cancer in 1989.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Trashmen Drummer Steve Wahrer Dies At 47 | url=https://apnews.com/7379c89a8948dbb8b803f9f94e58a5bc | website=AP News | publisher=[[Associated Press]] | date=23 January 1989 | archive-url=https://archive.today/20200308192647/https://apnews.com/7379c89a8948dbb8b803f9f94e58a5bc | archive-date=8 March 2020 | url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url={{Google books|PtpkCgAAQBAJ|page=252|plainurl=yes}} |quote=Steve Wahrer (born November 22, 1941 in Minnesota – January 21, 1989) |title=The Encyclopedia of Dead Rock Stars: Heroin, Handguns, and Ham Sandwiches |first=Jeremy |last=Simmonds |page=252 |publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-1556527548}}</ref> Later, Tony Andreason's brother Mark replaced Wahrer as drummer. Reed's son Robin joined as a touring member in 2009 on drums, filling in for Mark Andreason.

In 1999, the Trashmen played at the [[Las Vegas Grind]]. They also performed in [[Illinois]], [[Ohio]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Spain]] in 2007 and 2008. 

The Trashmen toured Europe in 2008 and in 2010, performing in [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Belgium]], [[Italy]], [[Austria]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], and [[Finland]].

The band recorded four tracks at Custom Recording Studios in [[Golden Valley, Minnesota]], with longtime fan and guitarist Deke Dickerson, for the record label Major Label, releasing the 7" EP ''I'm a Trashman'' in March 2013. A full-length follow-up LP, ''Bringing Back the Trash'', was released in April 2014. After several 2015 shows in the band's hometown of [[Minneapolis]], the band re-entered retirement.
