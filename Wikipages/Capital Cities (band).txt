A subsequent single, "[[Kangaroo Court (song)|Kangaroo Court]]", was released on March 27, 2012.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/498715/listen-capital-cities-drop-kangaroo-court|title=Capital Cities Drop Kangaroo Court|date=2012-03-29|access-date= 2012-11-27|publisher=Billboard.com}}</ref> The band was featured on the Pop Up #1 compilation selected by [[Perez Hilton]] that was released on August 7, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://perezhilton.com/2012-08-06-perez-hilton-pop-up-compilation-album#.ULcII9PjlAg|title=Pop Up!

The band's debut album, ''[[In a Tidal Wave of Mystery]]'', was released June 4, 2013 via [[Capitol Records]] in partnership with Lazy Hooks. It was the first release of new material on Capitol with a [[Universal Music Group]] catalog number. The album debuted at number sixty-six on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart.

==History==
The two musicians met after Merchant responded to Simonian's open ad on [[Craigslist]] offering his production services. They began [[jingle]]-writing together. After three years successfully  composing music for commercials and advertising campaigns, the duo formed Capital Cities. The band released its debut, self-titled EP in June 2011 via their label, Lazy Hooks.

In 2012, the band signed with [[Capitol Records]]. In partnership with Lazy Hooks, the label released ''[[In a Tidal Wave of Mystery]]'', the band's debut album, on June 4, 2013.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://indiemusic.co/2013/06/24/in-a-tidal-wave-of-mystery-capital-cities-debut-album-is-out/ |title=In A Tidal Wave Of Mystery, Capital Cities’ Debut Album, Is Out | website=Indiemusic.co |date=2013-06-24 |access-date=2013-09-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131021234830/http://indiemusic.co/2013/06/24/in-a-tidal-wave-of-mystery-capital-cities-debut-album-is-out/ |archive-date=2013-10-21 }}</ref> The album takes its name from the lyrics of its top 10 Modern Rock radio hit "[[Safe and Sound (Capital Cities song)|Safe and Sound]]",  the album's first single. The song has been used in promotional campaigns for [[HBO]], [[Smart Car]], [[Microsoft]], [[Mazda]] and many other spots. The album includes the songs "Kangaroo Court" and "I Sold My Bed, But Not My Stereo". [[Outkast]]'s [[André 3000]], vocalist Shemika Secrest and [[NPR]]'s Frank Tavares are featured on the song "[[Farrah Fawcett]] Hair". The album is produced and mixed entirely by the pair of Merchant and Simonian. The artwork is by Brazilian artist João Lauro Fonte.<ref>{{cite web|title=Capital Cities investe em "Safe and Sound" e lança terceiro videoclipe do single |url= http://tecoapple.mtv.uol.com.br/2013/04/25/capital-cities-safe-and-sound/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130615195434/http://tecoapple.mtv.uol.com.br/2013/04/25/capital-cities-safe-and-sound/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 June 2013 |work=TecoApple |publisher=[[MTV Brasil]] |access-date=8 June 2013 |date=25 April 2013 |language=pt }}</ref>

The band embarked on its first-ever North American outing, the "Dancing with Strangers" tour, with special guests Gold Fields, which kicked off on April 23 at the Crescent Ballroom in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]]. Capital Cities' May 9 show at New York City's [[Irving Plaza]] sold out two months in advance as well two nights at the [[El Rey Theatre]] in Los Angeles. All proceeds from the June 7 show at the El Rey went to [[MusiCares]] and a Place Called Home. The band has also appeared and performed at Sundance, [[South by Southwest|SXSW]], SweetLife,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sweetlifefestival.com/|title=SWEETLIFE - a sweetgreen festival|url-status= dead| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140518225147/http://sweetlifefestival.com/|archive-date=2014-05-18}}</ref> and ULTRA.

The band premiered the official video of "Safe and Sound" on April 25, 2013 on [[Vevo]]. The clip was directed by Grady Hall (who also has worked with [[Beck]] and [[Modest Mouse]]). In the video, the song fuels a mash-up of the past 100 years of dance, presided over by the band at the newly restored Los Angeles Theater in downtown [[Los Angeles]]. The video featured work from [[Emmy Award|Emmy]]-nominated choreographer [[Mandy Moore]]. The video was nominated for two 2013 MTV Video Music Awards: Best Art Direction and Best Visual Effects. The video won a 2013 MTV Video Music Award for Best Visual Effects.

In May 2013, "Safe and Sound" reached number one on the [[Media Control Charts|German Singles Chart]].

September 5, 2013 marked the premiere of the "Kangaroo Court" music video. The video features appearances from [[Darren Criss]], Shannon Woodward, and Channing Holmes. The story tells of a zebra (Merchant) who has been forbidden from a club, The Kangaroo Court. Attempting entry disguised as a horse, he falls for a lapdog (Woodward). Her date that night, a bulldog (Criss), becomes jealous and reveals the zebra for who he actually is. The zebra is placed under arrest for his crime and sent to court to face a kangaroo judge (Holmes). He is found guilty immediately and is executed by lion (Simonian).

The band was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Music Video.

Capital Cities joined [[Katy Perry]] on the North American leg of her [[Prismatic World Tour]].

In April and May 2016, nearly three years after the release of the band's debut album, the official Capital Cities Facebook page made two posts strongly suggesting that new music was in the works.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eh-hem!
