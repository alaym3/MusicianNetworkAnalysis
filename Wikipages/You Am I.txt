==History==
=== 1989–1992: Formation and early years ===
You Am I were formed in Sydney in December 1989 by [[Tim Rogers (musician)|Tim Rogers]] (ex- Pleasureheads, Glazed Expression) on vocals, guitar, mellotron and Hammond organ; his older brother Jaimme Rogers on drums; and Nick Tischler on bass guitar.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> Tim Rogers and Tischler were old school mates.<ref name="Nimmervoll"/> After forming, the band members began by trying to cover songs by [[Hard-Ons|the Hard-Ons]], [[X (Australian band)|X]], and [[Aerosmith]].<ref name="my-top-ten">{{cite web |title=My Top Ten - Tim Rogers |url=https://mytoptenrecords.com/category/tim-rogers/ |website=My Top Ten |access-date=11 December 2020}}</ref><ref name="mcfarlane-stone-2017">{{cite web |last1=McFarlane |first1=Ian |title=Tim Rogers, You Am I & Detours - I'm in Love with that Song |url=https://www.thirdstonepress.com.au/archive-blog/2017/9/20/tim-rogers-you-am-i-detours |website=Third Stone Press |access-date=11 December 2020 |date=September 2017}}</ref>

At an early gig, a fan provided "a big spiritual spiel about '.... I am you... you am i...'. The band took that as the inspiration for the working title" for the group's name.<ref name="Nimmervoll"/> This initial line-up was short-lived, Jaimme left before the end of the following year after a "fight" with Tim, and he was replaced by Mark Tunaley on drums.<ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="Nimmervoll"/> In the band's 1993 song, "[[Jaimme's Got a Gal]]", Tim explained why his brother left.

You Am I signed with an independent label, [[Timberyard Records]], and in May 1991 issued a six-track extended play, ''[[Snake Tide]]''.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> It was recorded in February at Electric Avenue Studios with Phil Punch as engineer, mixer and co-producer with the group.<ref name="AMO Snake"/> Australian musicologist, [[Ian McFarlane]], described the EP as "rough hewn".<ref name="McFarlane"/> You Am I appeared at the inaugural [[Big Day Out]] concert, held in Sydney in January 1992.<ref name="AMO Fletcher"/>

By April 1992, Tischler had left the band "because he didn't think he could fulfill Tim's vision".<ref name="Nimmervoll"/> He was replaced by their previous live sound mixer, [[Andy Kent]] (ex-Pupils of Love), on bass guitar.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="Nimmervoll"/> In May they released a five-track EP, ''[[Goddamn (EP)|Goddamn]]'', which was produced by [[Tom Kazas]].<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> An alternative nine-track version of ''Goddamn'', which was expanded by adding four tracks from ''Snake Tide'', was also issued.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> McFarlane declared that "By that stage, Rogers had established his credentials as a fine songwriter and the band a reputation as an exciting, dynamic live act."<ref name="McFarlane"/>

By mid-1992, they had signed with another independent label, [[rooArt Records]], on their subsidiary rA Records, which was distributed by [[Warner Music Group|WEA]].<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="Nimmervoll"/> The group released their third EP, ''[[Can't Get Started]]'', as a five-track set in October 1992,<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> which was co-produced by the band with David Price. Before the end of the year You Am I supported [[Hoodoo Gurus]] on a national tour.<ref name="McFarlane"/>

=== 1993–1994: Debut album: ''Sound as Ever'' ===
Late in 1992, Tim Rogers sent samples of You Am I's releases to [[Lee Ranaldo]] of American rock group, [[Sonic Youth]].<ref name="Nimmervoll"/> In January 1993 both groups appeared at the second Big Day Out festival in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth.<ref name="McFarlane"/> While in Sydney, Ranaldo co-produced You Am I's five-track EP, ''[[Coprolalia (EP)|Coprolalia]]'', which was issued in April.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> McFarlane opined that it was "bursting with kinetic energy and first-rate songs."<ref name="McFarlane"/> You Am I co-headlined a national tour from May to June, with [[stoner metal]]lers, [[Tumbleweed (band)|Tumbleweed]].<ref name="McFarlane"/>

You Am I travelled to [[Cannon Falls, Minnesota]], using Sonic Youth's [[Pachyderm Studio|Pachyderm Recording Studios]].<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Nimmervoll"/> For eight days Ranaldo produced their debut album, ''[[Sound as Ever (You Am I album)|Sound as Ever]]'' (November 1993), with Wayne Connolly as audio engineer.<ref name="McFarlane"/> It appeared on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Albums Chart]] top&nbsp;100. Mark Morgenstein of [[AllMusic]] felt the work "shows this power trio in top form, with enthusiastic backing to well-written songs... [if it] was a little more consistent, this would be a classic."<ref name="AMG Morgenstein"/>

In May 2013, Rogers reminisced, "I lost an incredibly important person to cancer who I still think about every day and that experience pretty much coloured the whole record."<ref name="Purdie"/> He referred to his mentor, Stephen "Goose" Gray of Sydney-based rock group, Box the Jesuit, who had died of [[lymphoma]] in August 1993.<ref name="Purdie"/><ref name="McFarlane BtJ"/> "[Goose] would have wanted me to stay in America to finish the album so that's what I did. But there's no nostalgia or good feelings about that time."<ref name="Purdie"/>

In October 1993, ahead of the album's release, Tunaley was "fired from the band with a simple phone call."<ref name="Nimmervoll"/> He had "wanted to play heavier music", however Kent and Rogers "wanted to play a more pop based rock".<ref name="Nimmervoll"/> Rogers initially considered disbanding the group but continued with [[Rusty Hopkinson|Russell Hopkinson]] (ex-[[Nursery Crimes (band)|Nursery Crimes]]) on drums, percussion and backing vocals.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> At the [[ARIA Music Awards of 1994]] in March they won the newly created category, Best Alternative Release for ''Sound as Ever''.<ref name="ARIA List"/>

''Sound as Ever'' provided three singles, "[[Adam's Ribs (song)|Adam's Ribs]]" (October 1993), "[[Berlin Chair]]" (February 1994) and "Jaimme's Got a Gal" (May).<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Nimmervoll"/> All three received high rotation on national youth radio station, [[Triple J]];<ref name="Nimmervoll"/> each was listed on the station's annual listeners' poll, [[Triple J Hottest 100|Hottest 100]]: "Adam's Ribs" at No.&nbsp;50 in [[Triple J Hottest 100, 1993|January 1994]], "Berlin Chair " at No.&nbsp;23 and "Jaimme's Got a Gal" at No.&nbsp;77 in [[Triple J Hottest 100, 1994|January 1995]].<ref name="Triple J Hottest 100"/>

===1994–1995: ''Hi Fi Way''===
For seven days during mid-September 1994 You Am I decamped to Greene Street Studios, New York.<ref name="Nimmervoll"/> Again they worked with Ranaldo, as producer, to record their second album, ''[[Hi Fi Way]]'' which was released on 20 February 1995.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> Ahead of the album, in November 1994, they issued a limited pressing (449 units) of "[[When You Got Dry/How Much Is Enough|When You Got Dry"/"How Much Is Enough]]" as a double-A sided vinyl single.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> "[[Cathy's Clown (You Am I song)|Cathy's Clown]]" was released as a single in early February, which peaked at No.&nbsp;36 on the ARIA Singles Chart.<ref name="AUS Charts"/> ''Hi Fi Way'' reached the number-one position on the related albums chart.<ref name="AUS Charts"/> A limited edition version included a bonus disc, ''Someone Else's Crowd'', which had seven live tracks recorded at their gig at [[Memorial Stadium (Seattle)|Memorial Stadium, Seattle]] on 13 August 1994.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="AUS Charts"/>

McFarlane described the album, which "remains one of the finest Australian albums of the 1990s. Full of audacious, incisive and tuneful rock'n'roll it made its debut at #1 on the mainstream national chart and went on to sell over 35000 copies."<ref name="McFarlane"/> [[Ed Nimmervoll]] of HowlSpace website felt it was "reflective, lyrically nostalgic";<ref name="Nimmervoll"/> while AllMusic's Steven McDonald wrote it was "[a] cute outing that throws in thumpy drums, crunchy guitars and delightfully whiny Mellotron string noises along the way."<ref name="AMG McDonald"/> By April 1995 the group had added Greg Hitchcock (ex-The Verys) as an auxiliary member on guitar and keyboards.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/>

At the [[ARIA Music Awards of 1995]] You Am I received their second trophy for Best Alternative Album, for ''Hi Fi Way''.<ref name="ARIA List"/> They were also nominated for Album of the Year, Best Group, Best Video ("Jewels and Bullets", directed by Robbie Douglas-Turner) and Best Cover Art (by Simon Anderson).<ref name="ARIA List"/> ''Hi Fi Way'' is listed at No.&nbsp;8 in the book, ''[[100 Best Australian Albums]]'' (October 2010).<ref name="ODonnell"/><ref name="AutoV6-1"/> The authors described it as "a textured, immediate pop record that delves through layers of memories, looking back to consider the past even as it makes sober judgements for the future."<ref name="ODonnell"/> In July 2013 it re-entered the top&nbsp;50 for a week.<ref name="AUS Charts"/>

===1996–1997: ''Hourly, Daily''===
You Am I's third album, ''[[Hourly, Daily]]'' was released in July 1996, was produced by the group and recorded at Q Sound Studios, Sydney in December 1995.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="ODonnell"/> They were assisted by engineers, Connolly and [[Paul McKercher]], which appeared on Ra/rooArt and was distributed by [[Shock Records]].<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> According to Rogers "[it] was my first attempt at a song cycle."<ref name="ODonnell"/> McFarlane wrote that it is "another album of urgent, adventurous, unabashed pure pop."<ref name="McFarlane"/> Nimmervoll felt it was "a nostalgic journey musically, reflecting Tim Rogers' love of The Sixties. Instead of reflecting his own life, Tim's lyrics looked at the suburban lives of others."<ref name="Nimmervoll"/> ''Hourly, Daily'' also debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on the ARIA Albums Charts,<ref name="AUS Charts"/> and is the first on the Shock Records label to do so upon launch. A limited edition was issued with a bonus disc of seven live tracks, ''Beat Party''.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/>

For their US and United Kingdom versions of ''Hourly, Daily'' on WEA/Warner Bros and rooArt/BMG, in March 1997, two tracks were replaced by newly recorded material, "[[Trike (song)|Trike]]" and "Opportunities".<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> AllMusic's Jason Anderson opined that ''Hourly, Daily'' "did little to ingratiate the group to an America fascinated with the packaging of youth culture... [it is] a conceptual piece that is obsessed with the past but without retro trappings... [Rogers' lyrics] laces together complex ideas with a narrative that transforms the pain of growing up artistic and male in Australia into a weird rock & roll existentialism."<ref name="AMG Anderson"/> The album provided five singles, with the first four reaching the top&nbsp;50 on the ARIA Singles Chart: "[[Mr. Milk]]" (November 1995), "[[Soldiers (You Am I song)|Soldiers]]" (July 1996), "[[Good Mornin']]" (September), "[[Tuesday (You Am I song)|Tuesday]]" (February 1997) and "Trike" (July).<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="AUS Charts"/> "Tuesday" peaked at No.&nbsp;29.<ref name="AUS Charts"/>

At the [[ARIA Music Awards of 1996]] ''Hourly, Daily'', and the related singles, provided nine nominations, with the group winning six trophies: Album of the Year, Best Group, Best Independent Release, Producer of the Year, Best Video ("[[Soldiers (You Am I song)|Soldiers]]", directed by [[Andrew Lancaster]]) and [[ARIA Award for Engineer of the Year|Engineer of the Year]] (Paul McKercher and Wayne Connolly).<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="ARIA List"/> The album was certified platinum by ARIA by the end of 1997 to acknowledge the shipment of 70000 units.<ref name="ARIA Creds 97"/> It was listed at No.&nbsp;55 in ''100 Best Australian Albums'' where the authors felt the group were "heavily under the spell of late '60s English music... in particular the Pretty Things' ''S.F. Sorrow''... [which] follows the journey of the character... from birth through love, war, tragedy, madness and old age."<ref name="ODonnell"/>

===1998–1999: ''#4 Record''===
Subtle country influences were apparent on You Am I's ''[[No. 4 Record|#4 Record]]'', released in April 1998, such as the track, "[[Heavy Heart (song)|Heavy Heart]]". It was produced by [[George Drakoulias]] in Los Angeles, which was their third number-one album in a row – they are the first Australian band to do so.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="AUS Charts"/> McFarlane believes it is "lean, nifty rock’n’roll";<ref name="McFarlane"/> Nimmervoll wrote it was a "back-to-basics" album.<ref name="Nimmervoll"/> The limited edition version included a bonus disc of nine tracks, ''Radio Settee''.<ref name="Holmgren"/> By that time the rooArt label had been acquired by [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]].<ref name="Partsch"/>

The album provided three singles, "[[What I Don't Know 'bout You]]" (February 1998), "[[Rumble (You Am I song)|Rumble]]" (April) and "Heavy Heart" (July).<ref name="McFarlane"/> "What I Don't Know 'bout You" is their highest charting single, which peaked at No.&nbsp;28;<ref name="AUS Charts"/> whereas "Heavy Heart" is their highest placed track on any annual Triple J Hottest 100, which was listed at No.&nbsp;9, in [[Triple J Hottest 100, 1998|January 1999]].<ref name="Triple J Hottest 100"/>

By July 1999, the line-up of the group was augmented by [[David Lane (musician)|Davey Lane]] of [[The Pictures]] on second guitar.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="Nimmervoll"/> Lane came to the band's attention via his work with The Pictures and by accurately transcribing You Am I's guitar tabs from ''#4 Record'' on an early fan site.<ref name="AutoV6-3"/><ref name="Beat Mag"/> Lane said – on ''[[The Cream & the Crock (video)|The Cream & the Crock]]'' (November 2003) video documentary – that he almost decided not to be a part of the band, as he was "fucking up his favourite band by playing in it" after he had played his first show with them and stuffed up his solos.<ref name="NLA Cream"/><ref name="Lane"/>

Jack Rabid of AllMusic described ''#4 Record'', which "beguiles, teases, sweetens, and often throbs in popcraft. It also blasts in fits and starts of harsh edge, chops, infectious attitude, and, when it suits them, abandon."<ref name="AMG Rabid"/> Sarah Zupko of [[PopMatters]] website felt it "keeps the power in power pop" and compared their sound with "early Who, early Jam, Sloan and a touch of the Rolling Stones, but with horns."<ref name="Zupko"/>

You Am I recorded their first live album, ''[[...Saturday Night, 'Round Ten]]'', over a three-night series of gigs at Casa del Resaca, a warehouse in Richmond, in July 1999.<ref name="McFarlane"/> It was released in September and includes Lane on guitar.<ref name="McFarlane"/> McFarlane noticed that they provided "a strong, swaggering live outing that confirmed the band's standing as one of the country's premier rock'n'roll acts."<ref name="McFarlane"/> It peaked at No.&nbsp;7 on the ARIA Albums Chart.<ref name="AUS Charts"/> The limited edition version included a five-track CD-ROM.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/>

===2000–2001: ''Dress Me Slowly''===
After three years between studio albums, due to touring and record label interference, You Am I released ''[[Dress Me Slowly]]'' in April 2001 on BMG.<ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="Nimmervoll"/> It was Lane's first appearance on a studio album, which was produced by [[Clif Norrell]].<ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="Nimmervoll"/> According to Nimmervoll the group were "under a lot of pressure to 'write hits' and 'play the game' for the sake of their US breakthrough."<ref name="Nimmervoll"/> The album debuted at No.&nbsp;3 on the ARIA Albums Chart.<ref name="AUS Charts"/>
[[File:You_Am_I_August_2011.jpg|thumb|right|Live in 2011]]

Anderson felt it was "[s]ubtly toned down, yet still spunky with its clever lyrics and pure guitar pop ... [with] slightly more serious material with all the verve and personality fans should expect."<ref name="AMG Anderson 2"/> Bill Partsch of Trouser Press opined that "the sound is more muscular... the album is tasty and satisfying, but not especially divine."<ref name="Partsch"/> Nimmervoll declared that "[r]ather than compromising You Am I went straight to the heart of what [they] should sound like as far as the band is concerned."<ref name="Nimmervoll"/>

The limited edition version of ''Dress Me Slowly'' included an eight-track disc, ''The Temperance Union'', which were solo recordings by Rogers and studio musicians.<ref name="Holmgren"/> Three singles were released from the standard album, "[[Damage (You Am I song)|Damage]]" (October 2000), "[[Get Up (You Am I song)|Get Up]]" (March 2001) and "[[Kick a Hole in the Sky]]" (July).<ref name="AUS Charts"/>

===2002–2004: ''Deliverance''===
You Am I's sixth studio album, ''[[Deliverance (You Am I album)|Deliverance]]'', was recorded in January 2002 and released in September 2002. It did not receive the kind of critical and commercial success that the band's earlier work had enjoyed. It was produced by McKercher and peaked at No.&nbsp;12 on the ARIA Albums Chart.<ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="AUS Charts"/> Nimmervoll explained that the group's problems with BMG were reflected in the album, which "was the aftermath of that painful episode, relaxed, eclectic, self-produced, and stubbornly without anything resembling a 'hit' single."<ref name="Nimmervoll"/> The band released "[[Who Put the Devil in You]]" as a download-only internet single in the same month.

In September 2003,<ref name=The-Age-2003-Donovan>{{cite web|last1=Donovan|first1=Patrick|title=Am I there yet?|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/09/26/1064083105192.html|website=The Age|access-date=20 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120085206/http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/09/26/1064083105192.html|archive-date=20 November 2015|date=26 September 2003}}</ref> You Am I were dropped by record label BMG after "the company refused to support a tour of the US."<ref name="Nimmervoll"/> AllMusic's Hal Horowitz noticed it was "a slight departure from their existing catalog, ''Deliverance'' nonetheless delivers the pop-rock goods... The acoustic guitars that propel much of the last half of the disc don't soften the band's sound as much as muss it up, adding a rootsy, more organic texture."<ref name="AMG Horowitz"/>

At the [[Falls Festival]] held at Marion Bay over New Year's Eve of 2004–05, You Am I were scheduled to play a set. Rogers appeared on stage heavily intoxicated and, when a fight broke out between Rogers and Lane, the group were forced off stage much to the disappointment of festival goers.<ref name="Palathingal"/> Rogers also accidentally knocked fellow artist, [[Missy Higgins]], over.<ref name="Cayley"/> Missy Higgins and [[The Beautiful Girls]] were re-called onto stage to do a quick impromptu performance to fill the hour set-time.<ref name="AAP 1"/>

===2005–2007: ''Convicts''===
In late 2005, You Am I recorded their seventh studio album entitled ''[[Convicts (You Am I album)|Convicts]]'' with producer Greg Wales. The title is believed to be a tongue in cheek dig of English people referring to Australians as convicts because of their [[First Fleet]] origins. It may also refer to the alternative name used by the band to perform secret gigs during the ''[[Hi Fi Way]]''–''[[No. 4 Record|#4 Record]]'' era. The album was released on 13 May 2006 on the band's new record label, [[Virgin Records|Virgin]]. The ''Convicts'' album was also released in the USA on [[Yep Roc Records]].  The band toured America in the autumn and summer of 2007 to promote the record.

===2008–2009: ''Dilettantes''===
[[File:Tim Rogers and Rusty Hopkinson at the ANU Bar November 2008.JPG|thumb|Rogers and Hopkinson during a You Am I concert at the ANU Bar in November 2008]]
The band's 8th studio album, ''[[Dilettantes (album)|Dilettantes]]'', was released on 13 September 2008,<ref name="AutoV6-6"/><ref name="AutoV6-7"/> alongside the radio-only single [[Erasmus (song)|Erasmus]]. The album debuted at number one on the ARIA Australian Music charts, and number twelve on the overall chart.

In August 2010, it was announced that they had left EMI to sign with new Sydney label [[Other Tongues]].

===2010–2014 :''You Am I''===
[[File:You Am I @ Fly By Night Club (18 11 2010) (5210334079).jpg|thumb|Rogers fronting You Am I, Fly by Night Club, November 2010]]
The band's ninth self-titled album was released on 8 October 2010.<ref name="AutoV6-8"/> In an interview with music journalist Nick Milligan on 24 September 2010, Rogers said of the ninth You Am I album:

<blockquote>
I'm still bewildered by this record. I haven't gotten my head around it. It was extraordinary making it and I don't feel like I've finished the creation of it. I'm still yet to understand it. I like that. I think with previous records I felt I understood what went on and what we were supposed to do. What it's references were. With this [record] I just let myself freefall into it and get lost in the creation of it. I haven't got a grasp on it and I'm enjoying the exhilaration of that. I'm still listening to this record wondering who the person was that wrote that ... and whether I'd like to meet him.<ref name="AutoV6-9"/></blockquote>

To coincide with the 20th anniversary of the band's debut album, reissues of ''Sound As Ever'', ''Hi Fi Way'' and ''Hourly Daily'' were released on 7 June 2013. A limited-edition beer brewed by the Sydney brewery Young Henrys was sold in conjunction under the name 'Brew Am I'.<ref name="Darren"/>
<ref name="AutoV6-10"/>

===2015–2019: ''Porridge & Hotsauce''===

===Former members===
Jaimme Rogers and Nick Tischler were in an early incarnation of the band, lasting December 1989 to the end of 1990. This line-up is not known to have recorded any music.

Mark Tunaley was the band's first "official" drummer, and is You Am I's only drummer to date to employ heavy metal style of drumming, which included double bass drum parts. He left the group shortly after the recording of ''Sound As Ever'', due to differing perceptions of the band's direction. His sole songwriting contribution to the band ('Off The Field') was left off the US release of the album.

Greg Hitchcock, formerly of The Verys, was a touring member of the band for the ''Hourly, Daily'' era. He played guitar and electric piano with the band for some time up until ''#4 Record''. He was never formally a member of the band, but appeared in the video clips for 'Soldiers', 'Good Mornin' and 'Tuesday' (though ironically not in the 'Trike' clip, on which he actually played the organ solo). Rogers later said that he was never quite comfortable with the electric piano on stage because he felt the band lost its spontaneous feel.
