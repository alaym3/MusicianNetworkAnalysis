'''Shellac''' is an American [[noise rock]] band from [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], composed of [[Steve Albini]] (guitar and vocals), [[Bob Weston]] (bass guitar and vocals) and [[Todd Trainer]] (drums and vocals) and formed in 1992.  Their music genre has been classified as [[post-hardcore]]<ref name=TopArtistsAllmusic>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/post-hardcore-d12962/artists |title=Explore: Post-Hardcore (Top Artists) |work=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=September 4, 2011}}</ref><ref name="treblezine">{{cite web |url=http://www.treblezine.com/features/107.html |title=The 90-Minute Guide - Post-Hardcore |author=Terich, Jeff |date=April 24, 2007 |work=Treblezine |access-date=September 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404010139/http://www.treblezine.com/features/107.html |archive-date=April 4, 2011 }}</ref> and [[math rock]], but they describe themselves as a "[[minimal music|minimalist]] [[rock music|rock]] trio."

==Biography==
Shellac formed in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]], in 1992 as an informal collaboration between guitarist [[Steve Albini]] and drummer Todd Trainer.  Former [[Naked Raygun]] bassist Camilo Gonzalez sat in on early rehearsals and played on one song on Shellac's first single before permanent bassist Bob Weston, formerly of [[Boston]]'s [[Volcano Suns]], joined.

Shellac has a distinctive, minimalist sound based on asymmetric [[time signature]]s, repetitive rhythms, an angular guitar sound, and both Albini's and Weston's surreal, bitingly [[sarcasm|sarcastic lyrics]]. Songs typically do not have traditional [[verse–chorus form|verse/chorus/verse]] structure and the arrangements are sparse, to the point where some describe them as "amelodic". Shellac's signature sound is often associated with their enthusiasm for vintage [[Travis Bean]] guitars, a rare brand of [[aluminium]]-necked instruments, and the Interfax "Harmonic Percolator" [[Distortion|distortion pedal]]. Albini is known to use [[copper]] [[plectrum]]s and typically wraps his guitar strap around his waist rather than over his shoulder. The band prefers the intimacy of smaller clubs and live appearances are sporadic.

Both Weston and Albini are [[recording engineer]]s. They prefer a sparse, analog recording sound with little or no overdubbing, and are meticulous about microphone placement and choice of equipment.

Mid-set in many live performances Shellac take the time for one or more "question and answer" sessions, where members of the band respond in an off-the-cuff and, at times, jocular manner to questions shouted out by fans and [[heckler]]s alike.

Shellac made an early decision to not play at festivals, and this position was articulated to [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] (ATP) festival organizer Barry Hogan during the preparation stage of the inaugural ATP event. However, Scottish band [[Mogwai]], curating the festival, convinced Albini to perform: "They (ATP) completely changed the festival game. Now the whole world has to operate under the knowledge that there are these cool, curated festivals where everyone is treated well and the experience is a generally pleasant one."<ref name="GQ-2010">{{cite web|last=Lake Smith|first=Aaron|date=September 29, 2010|title=The Verge Q+A: Punk Pioneer Steve Albini on Music Festivals, The Future of Radio and Why He Wants GQ To Fail|url=https://www.gq.com/blogs/the-q/2010/09/steve-albini.html|access-date=January 11, 2014|work=GQ Magazine}}</ref> In 2002, the band curated the All Tomorrow's Parties festival in [[Camber Sands]], England. Knowing that most of the audience had come specifically to see Shellac, the band went on first every morning as an incentive for the festival-goers to be up in time to see the other acts. A CD of tracks from the bands performing at the festival was released on [[ATP Recordings|ATP Records]].

To celebrate their 20th anniversary as a band, Shellac returned to ATP to curate once more in December 2012 with the line-up including [[Wire (band)|Wire]], [[Scrawl]], [[Mission Of Burma]], [[The Ex (band)|The Ex]] + Brass Unbound, [[Red Fang]], [[Shannon Wright]], [[The Membranes]], Alix, Bear Claw, [[Helen Money]], [[Dead Rider]], [[Arcwelder]], [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]], [[Mono (Japanese band)|Mono]], [[Melt Banana]], [[Uzeda]], [[Prinzhorn Dance School]], Three Second Kiss, [[Buke and Gase]], [[Oxbow (band)|Oxbow]], [[Nina Nastasia]], [[Zeni Geva]], [[Bottomless Pit (band)|Bottomless Pit]], Pinebender, STNNNG and more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpfestival.com/events/shellacxmas.php |title=Nightmare Before Christmas curated by Shellac Of North America - All Tomorrow's Parties |publisher=Atpfestival.com |access-date=2013-10-26}}</ref>

In April 2013, Albini stated that a fifth Shellac LP was "just about finished" although it had "no projected release date". It would "most likely" feature nine songs and be released on [[Touch and Go Records]] despite the considerable downsizing that the label has undergone.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SSHjgrqpMQ |title=Steve Albini says new Shellac LP is done |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2013-10-26}}</ref>

==Legacy==
[[File:Shellac - First Avenue Star.jpg|thumb|Star honoring Shellac on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub [[First Avenue (nightclub)|First Avenue]]]]Writing for [[Drowned in Sound]], Benjamin Bland states:<ref name=des/>

<blockquote>[[Big Black]] and Shellac are surely the two most influential '[[noise rock]]' groups there have ever been. Hundreds of bands have sounded like them, and in all probability so will hundreds more. Who can blame them? When a shadow that large looms over an entire subgenre of music, it’s hard not to be influenced by it, let alone ignore it altogether.</blockquote>

[[John Robb (musician)|John Robb]], music critic and frontman of British [[post-punk]] band [[The Membranes]], called Shellac "the finest rock band on the planet. This is the rock band that the rest of us in our bands [...] have had to measure ourselves against and if we are found wanting then we have to cower behind rocks and attempt to revive our measly offerings until they measure up."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://louderthanwar.com/shellac-dude-incredible-album-review-1010-for-a-stunning-return/|title=Shellac: Dude Incredible - album review. '10/10 For A Stunning Return'|date=September 15, 2014}}</ref>  [[Vish Khanna]] expanded on their influence, noting that "[t]he band's sense of empathy, great storytelling, interpersonal politics and black humour are not necessarily uncommon in post-punk noise-rock bands, but Shellac's path is likely the most distinctive and emulated one."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/shellac-dude_incredible|title=Shellac Dude Incredible|website=exclaim.ca}}</ref>
