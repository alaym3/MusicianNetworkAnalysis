'''From First to Last''' is an American [[post-hardcore]] band based in the [[Los Angeles Area]] and [[Tampa, Florida]]. Formed by Matt Good, Scott Oord, and Parker Nelms in November 1999, the current line-up consists of Matt Good (lead guitar), [[Skrillex|Sonny Moore]] (lead vocals), [[Travis Richter]] (rhythm guitar), and [[Derek Bloom]] (drums).

The band released their first EP titled ''[[Aesthetic (album)|Aesthetic]]'' in 2003 which they recorded with founding member and vocalist Phillip Reardon who left the band in 2004 due to personal and creative differences. ''[[Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Bodycount]]'' followed in 2004 and ''[[Heroine (From First to Last album)|Heroine]]'' in 2006, both with Moore.

Following the departure of Moore in February 2007 to work on his solo electronic project, the band added permanent bassist Matt Manning, and Good moved to lead vocals/guitar. Their third [[From First to Last (album)|self-titled studio album]] was released in 2008 on Suretone Records. In August 2009 the band signed to Rise Records. In late 2009, Richter left the band. Their fourth studio album, ''[[Throne to the Wolves]]'' was released on March 16, 2010. On July 28, 2010, the band entered a hiatus.

In November 2013, the band re-formed, with [[Periphery (band)|Periphery]] vocalist Spencer Sotelo as the new lead vocalist, as well as Richter rejoining the band. They released their fifth album ''[[Dead Trees (Album)|Dead Trees]]'' in August 2015. Sotelo departed the band in July 2016. Former vocalist Sonny Moore rejoined the band in January 2017. In May 2020 Matt Good admitted that while there are a few tracks that could be on a new album, he's unsure if it will ever come to fruition.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/from-first-to-last-matt-good-new-album-rumor-sonny-moore-rejoining|title=YOU CAN THANK MATT GOOD FOR RUMORS OF A NEW FROM FIRST TO LAST ALBUM|date=May 18, 2020}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation and ''Aesthetic'' (1999&ndash;2003)===
{{main article|Aesthetic (EP)}}
'''First Too Last'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.purevolume.com/firsttoolastfftl|title=First Too Last - FFTL on PureVolume|author=Mitchell Pavao, Brett Woitunski|work=PureVolume|access-date=April 13, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021062842/http://www.purevolume.com/firsttoolastfftl|archive-date=October 21, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> was created in November 1999 in [[Tampa]] by Matt Good, Michael Blanchard and Scott Oord. Scott played bass, while Matt took on lead vocals and was convinced by Scott to also play guitar. Parker Nelms (drums) held practice at his house, but when the band began to travel, Parker was too young to do so. He was replaced by Steve Pullman to round out the lineup that, for the next three years, would play small shows in [[Florida]].

In 2002, Matt joined the [[grindcore]] band [[The Color of Violence]] (at that time, called ''Slaughter vs Skeleton, Fetus Destroyer''), where he met [[Travis Richter]] (guitar), who would later join First To Last, and Joey Antillion (bass). Some time later, Greg Taylor joined as (drums), who wrote about 4 songs, in which the ''Aesthetic Demos'' were created. After hearing the demos of what would be their first EP, Phillip Reardon (lead vocals) and [[Derek Bloom]] (drums) joined the band.

In 2003, the band released their debut EP ''[[Aesthetic EP|Aesthetic]]'' on Four Leaf Recordings which featured the vocals of Reardon, Good and Richter. By the end of the year, they had changed their name to '''From First To Last''' and signed to [[Epitaph Records]].<ref name="AMG">{{cite web| title= Biography| publisher= All Music| url= {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p619228/biography|pure_url=yes}} | access-date= August 17, 2007}}</ref>

===''Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Bodycount'' (2004)===
{{main article| Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Bodycount}}
After the ''Aesthetic'' EP, the band wanted to move Matt Good to lead vocals. However, Good was reluctant to take on both lead vocal and lead guitar duties. He wanted From First to Last to have a frontman, to connect with the crowd better. Using the social networking site [[MySpace]], Good came in contact with a guitarist and singer from California, [[Skrillex|Sonny Moore]]. Moore flew to Valdosta, Georgia, where ''Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Bodycount'' was being recorded, and was set to be the band's rhythm guitarist. However, when the other band members heard Moore singing "Featuring Some of Your Favorite Words", they decided that he was much better suited for lead singer than guitarist.<ref name="Epitaph">{{cite web| title= From First to Last Biography| publisher= Epitaph Records| url= http://epitaph.com/artists/artist/147/| access-date= August 13, 2007| url-status= dead| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070824160330/http://epitaph.com/artists/artist/147/| archive-date= August 24, 2007| df= mdy-all}}</ref>	 
			
Matt Good wrote the album in two weeks. Moore came in after the music was tracked and completed the vocals. ''[[Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Bodycount]]'' was released on June 29, 2004.

From late May to mid-June 2005, From First to Last participated in the "Dead by Dawn" tour with bands [[Emanuel (band)|Emanuel]], [[Halifax (band)|Halifax]] and [[He Is Legend]].<ref name="DD">{{cite web| title= Emmanuel, From First to Last Tour| publisher= aversion.com| url= http://epitaph.com/artists/artist/147| access-date= August 18, 2007| url-status= bot: unknown| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070824160330/http://epitaph.com/artists/artist/147| archive-date= August 24, 2007| df= mdy-all}}</ref>

===''Heroine'' (2006)===
{{main article|Heroine (From First to Last album)}}
The band went to Radio Star Studios in [[Weed, California]] to record their second album, produced by [[Ross Robinson]].<ref name="Borland">{{cite web| title= From First To Last Are Done With Wes Borland, Target Rob Zombie| publisher= mtv.com| url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1517991/20051213/from_first_to_last.jhtml | access-date= August 17, 2007}}</ref> As their previous bassist Weisberg had been formally asked to leave the band due to internal conflicts, producer Ross Robinson asked [[Wes Borland]], former [[Limp Bizkit]] guitarist, to play bass on the album.<ref name="AMG"/> Borland later played several tours with the band. The album was released on March 21, 2006. It opened on the Billboard albums chart at No.&nbsp;25, with first-week sales of over 33,000.<ref name="MTV4">{{cite web| title= From First To Last Might Outgrow Fall Out Boy Pranks Soon| publisher= mtv.com| url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1527684/20060403/from_first_to_last.jhtml | access-date= August 18, 2007}}</ref> Shortly thereafter in April, they signed to major label [[Capitol Records]]<ref name="AMG"/> after bidding between that label and [[Warner Bros.]].<ref name="MTV4"/>

From mid March to mid May the band toured alongside [[Fall Out Boy]], [[Hawthorne Heights]] and [[The All-American Rejects]] for the "Black Clouds and Underdogs Tour" in support of their release Heroine.<ref name="Underdogs">{{cite web| title= Fall Out Boy Start Divulging New Tour Dates – The Real Ones, That Is| publisher= mtv.com| url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1519594/20060103/fall_out_boy.jhtml | access-date= August 18, 2007}}</ref>

FFTL then did a short European Tour with various bands. The band then played several dates on the 2006 Vans [[Warped Tour]], but were forced to drop out due to surgical removal of a [[Vocal fold nodule|nodule]] on Moore's vocal cords. He received his second nodule surgery in early July (his first being in May 2005).<ref name="Warped">{{cite web| title= From First To Last Singer Dispels More Rumors, Reveals Why Band Left Warped| publisher= mtv.com| url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1535846/20060707/from_first_to_last.jhtml | access-date= August 13, 2007}}</ref> Following his recovery, From First to Last went out on the "World Championship Tour" supporting [[Atreyu (band)|Atreyu]] along with [[Every Time I Die]] and [[Chiodos]]. While on that tour, Moore once again had vocal cord problems and had to leave the tour. The band had planned to have guitarists Good and Richter cover Moore's vocal duties for the duration of the tour until singer of Chiodos, Craig Owens, insisted that he provide lead vocals for their sets.<ref name="Chiodos">{{cite web| title= I am a Neanderthal and Proud of It| publisher= AbsolutePunk.net| url= http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=182876 | access-date= August 17, 2007}}</ref> Atreyu eventually forced From First to Last to drop the tour.<ref name="AMG"/> The band later explained, "Our plan to enable us to play the rest of the tour was disregarded and as our crew was setting up for the show in [[Worcester, MA]] we were informed that we were being kicked off of the tour. Understand that it was not our choice to leave this tour... we were forced to leave."<ref name="Chiodos"/> Atreyu then returned a statement about the controversy concerning From First to Last's departure, saying, "They couldn't perform as FFTL and are no longer on this tour."<ref name="Atreyu">{{cite web| title= Atreyu Speak Out: It's Only Music Kids.| publisher= AbsolutePunk.net| url= http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=183763 | access-date= August 17, 2007}}</ref>

Borland toured with From First To Last roughly since early 2006. He announced plans for a Fall 2006 tour that never went through due to Black Light Burns needing to find a new record label after Borland left Geffen Records. Borland has discussed plans to write and perform on the next From First To Last album, but he left the band due to Black Light Burns' busy schedule started to pick up, leaving no room for work with From First to Last.

===Moore's departure, lineup instability and self-titled album (2007&ndash;2009)===
{{Main article|From First to Last (album)}}
[[File:From First To Last.jpg|thumb|right|From First to Last performing in 2007]]
In February 2007, lead singer Moore left From First to Last to pursue a solo career.<ref name="Sonny">{{cite web| title= Sonny Quits From First To Last| publisher= AbsolutePunk.net| url= http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=216421 | access-date= August 17, 2007}}</ref> His decision to leave was based on his urge to create his own music, and also due to the fact that singing in the band was putting an immense strain on his vocal cords, resulting in serious damage which needed multiple surgeries in order to be fixed. Moore posted new recordings on his Myspace and was part of a group of a band called Sonny and the Blood Monkeys. Moore now writes, produces, and performs music under the alias/stage name [[Skrillex]], who has won 8 Grammy Awards for his electronic dance music, and now has 7 EP's and 2 Albums.	 
		 
After vocalist Moore's departure, From First to Last faced a crisis. Their label, Capitol Records, had dropped them due to financial problems. Without a vocalist, label, permanent bassist, or any money, the band almost split. Guitarist/Vocalist Matt Good, however, decided to take on lead vocals while still providing a backup guitar role. The band also quickly picked up Matt Manning to become a full-time bassist. The band then spent their remaining money on a studio in which to continue work on their already-written third album.	 
	 
The remaining members of From First to Last finished a headlining tour from July 21 through August 5 with guests [[Alesana]], [[Vanna (band)|Vanna]], Brighten, and Four Year Strong. Shortly before recording another album, the band played for a portion of the Show Must Go on tour with [[Hawthorne Heights]], [[Secondhand Serenade]], [[Powerspace]], and [[Brighten]], but later cancelled their dates on the last part of the tour to open for [[Deftones]] on a separate Canadian tour. 	 
		 
After completing a full mix of their new material, From First to Last was picked up by [[Suretone Records]]. Shortly after, they re-entered the studio to record their album again, this time with a professional crew and better quality. The band recorded this time in Los Angeles, with producer [[Josh Abraham]] and seasoned engineer Ryan Williams. At midnight on November 14, 2007, they released the first single from the album, ''Two as One'', on their Myspace account, and they later played that song live on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. A video was made for the song ''Worlds Away'' which was highly publicized. Although this record was widely promoted and the band had one of its biggest years ever, they personally feel the album was a failure in that it did not portray the true band as it was meant to be portrayed. Currently, they rarely, if ever, play any songs off this album, the only occasional one being the song "Deliverance".	 
		 
From First to Last began their fall headlining tour, ''RATHER BE SLAYIN' N00BZ'', starting November 1 with guests [[Blessthefall]], [[A Skylit Drive]], and [[Vanna (band)|Vanna]]. Around the middle of the tour, the guests changed to [[Envy on the Coast]], [[Pierce The Veil]], [[Four Year Strong]], and Mayday Parade. 
		 
On November 29, From First to Last announced they were going to be a part of the 2008 [[Hot Topic]] Take Action Tour. They played at the MTV Winter Valencia in Spain on March 6. On December 6, they announced they were going to be part of the 2008 Vans [[Warped Tour]].	 
	 
On May 6, 2008, From First to Last released their self-titled album, and starting June 20, hit the road on the Vans Warped Tour for its entirety.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://warpedtour.com/warpedtour/concerts.asp?tour=65 |title=Vans Warped Tour 2010: June 25 - August 15, 2010: Dates And Tickets |publisher=Warpedtour.com |date=August 15, 2009 |access-date=July 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703183633/http://warpedtour.com/warpedtour/concerts.asp?tour=65 |archive-date=July 3, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>	 
		 
On June 28, From First to Last updated their band members section of their MySpace, making [[Chris Lent]] a full-time member.	 
	 
From the end of September to October 12, From First to Last played on [[The Blackout (band)|The Blackout]]'s "Sleep All Day, Party All Night" tour in the UK, along with [[The Medic Droid]] and [[We Are The Ocean]].

===''Throne to the Wolves'' (2009–2010)===
{{main article|Throne to the Wolves}}
FFTL stated that they would be on a break from touring in late 2008. Members Travis Richter and [[Derek Bloom]] were focusing on their side project, [[The Color of Violence]], with tours soon after and a full-length debut album, [[Youthanize]], which was released April 7, 2009. Member [[Chris Lent]] toured as the drummer for the band [[I Set My Friends on Fire]] as well as one of the two drummers for The Color of Violence (along with Jon Syverson of the band [[Daughters (band)|Daughters]]); Lent also confirmed that he is no longer a member of FFTL and is now writing/recording with ISMFOF. FFTL began writing new songs early 2009 and started demoing new songs in March 2009 for their next album, expected to be released March 2010. A full-length demo of a song on the new album was put on their Myspace at that time, as well as the previously unheard b-side from Heroine, ''Save Us''. A Second Full Length Demo was added on July 3, 2009, and a message to fans that they would be announcing their recording schedule and tentative label. As of August 6, 2009, the band had begun to track drums for the new record at EarthSound studios in Valdosta Georgia, with Lee Dyess.

In September 2009, Miss May I announced they would be touring with From First to Last in October 2009.

On October 1, 2009 FFTL announced that they would be touring with Greeley Estates and {{Proper name|Therefore I Am}} in October and November, and also that they had signed to [[Rise Records]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=96306&blogId=512467064 |title=All kinds of news! - MySpace-blog &#124; van From First To Last |publisher=Blogs.myspace.com |access-date=July 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005071856/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=96306&blogId=512467064 |archive-date=October 5, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

{{cquote|"I want to announce officially that we've signed with Rise Records. We are all very excited about this move and think that together with Rise we can accomplish amazing things! If you're asking yourself why we made the change, well... There's a lot of aspects about being a major label that just didn't agree with the way we like to present our band and our music and I think that by ridding ourselves of that world, we are finally gonna set ourselves free to make the best music we can and that is the most important thing for us at the end of the day".}}

The band toured on the "You'd Be Way Cuter in a Coffin Tour" with [[Alesana]], The Word Alive, [[Asking Alexandria]], and [[Memphis May Fire]] in December 2009. Though recording was supposedly finished, the band was called off the road and was forced to cancel the last two weeks worth of performances – much to the dismay of fans, some of whom began to complain that the band could never finish a tour, and start rumors of a breakup – in order to go back home to Valdosta and put finishing touches on their recording. Matt Good responded to these claims and rumors<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=1406991&page=3 |title=FFTL Cancel Show - Page 3 - News Article |publisher=AbsolutePunk.net |access-date=July 2, 2010}}</ref>

{{cquote|"Guys we're not breaking up no worries. we just came home from the tour early because we have to finish our record before our next tour with alesana and our time frame was looking pretty small and stressful so Rise suggested we come home a little early.

From First to Last released a new song off the album, "Going Lohan", on their MySpace page in November.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/fftl |title=From First To Last op MySpace Music – Gratis gestreamde MP3's, foto's en Videoclips |publisher=Myspace.com |date=June 28, 2010 |access-date=July 2, 2010}}</ref> The new album, ''[[Throne to the Wolves]]'', was announced and slated for release on March 16, 2010.<ref name="absolutepunk.net">{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=1459312 |title=FFTL Name Record - News Article |publisher=AbsolutePunk.net |access-date=July 2, 2010}}</ref>

In late 2009 FFTL went through yet another lineup change with Travis Richter leaving the band; no official announcement had yet been made by the band and no reason was given for his departure. Matt Good and Matt Manning have been taking over Travis's screaming role and Blake Steiner (ex-Mia Medusa guitarist), who recorded on Throne to the Wolves, is his replacement. On December 31 FFTL released the song  "I'll Inoculate The World with the Virus of My Disillusionment" on their MySpace.

On January 20, 2010, From First to Last finally made an official announcement about Travis's departure from the band via [[Myspace]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=96306&blogId=526468063|title=About Travis|publisher=[[MySpace]]/From First to Last|date=January 19, 2010|access-date=August 2, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207065936/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view|archive-date=February 7, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

{{cquote|Since the news has become public I thought I'd take a minute to address it before wild rumors started flying around. Travis has been with us since the beginning and will always be someone I care about deeply. Unfortunately though, as time goes on sometimes people grow apart from each other. There's many things I could say, but they are rather personal and I don't think they need to be discussed here. This band is and always will be about making music with my friends. We don't give a fuck about fame or money or anything. It's about doing what we love together as a family. We aren't breaking up and we aren't changing our name. As long as we are making music we are proud of and having fun together, this band will continue to exist.

We wish the best to Travis in everything he does and he is still a friend to us. I want everyone to understand that this wasn't done out of hate or spite or any other negative emotion. The vibe needed to be creative together was just gone. It happens, it's sad and all, but that's just life. Anyone old enough to have personal relationships knows that people split ways all the time. That's how life is and it isn't going to change. We appreciate everyone who has stuck by this bands side through all these years. If this upsets you so greatly that you feel you can't listen to us anymore, that's ok and we understand. We still love you anyway ; )

Just know that when bands make these decisions they are always a last resort. NO ONE wants to have to kick out a member of their band. It is never easy and always incites drama, but sometimes you have to make really hard decisions. It's part of being an adult.}}

Travis is now the lead vocalist for the progressive metal band [[The Human Abstract (band)|The Human Abstract]]. Richter left the band in 2011 and became a dubstep producer with the group [[ModifiedNoise]].

Beginning on March 13, 2010 From First to Last headlined the Royal Family Tour 2010, supported by [[Eyes Set To Kill]], [[Confide]], [[Black Veil Brides]] and [[Sleeping with Sirens]]. That tour concluded on April 10. Eyes Set to Kill dropped off the tour for other engagements a week before.

[[Throne to the Wolves]] was released March 16, 2010. The album was received well by critics and fans alike; getting favorable reviews from Alternative Press, and Absolute Punk.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.altpress.com/reviews/thronetothewolves.htm |title=Alternative Press |publisher=Altpress.com |access-date=July 2, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314035710/http://altpress.com/reviews/thronetothewolves.htm |archive-date=March 14, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The album debuted at number 24 on the Billboard Top Hard Rock Albums, and number 45 on The Top Independent Albums.

Starting on May 8, 2010 the band toured with [[Our Last Night]], [[We Came as Romans]], and A Bullet For Pretty Boy on the Welcome to the Circus tour, headlined by [[Asking Alexandria]]. The tour will end on June 9

On June 10, 2010 the band will begin playing dates through June 18 supporting [[A Skylit Drive]] on the second half of the "Go Fist Pump Yourself Tour", along with Tides of Man and [[Abandon All Ships]]. [[I Set My Friends on Fire]] were originally slated to play, but ISMFOF was forced to back out due to recording delays.

=== Hiatus (2010–2013) ===
On July 28, 2010 Matt Good announced that From First to Last was going on hiatus:

{{cquote|Hey guys, just wanted to take a minute to update you all with the current status of FFTL. As of now right now we are basically going on hiatus. Now before everyone starts jumping to conclusions I just want to make sure everyone knows me and the other members of the band are all still very, very close. We have been best friends for years and will continue to be for as long as I can possibly forsee, so I don't want anyone to think this is a result of animosity between them and I. There is nothing but love between us.

This is mostly a decisions based on a changing of times and the desire to start pursuing new things in our lives. This band has been the center of our lives for our entire adulthood to date. Four full length albums and almost 8 years of solid touring later, the urge to see what else we are capable of achieving is almost overwhelming and I feel like there is no better time than now to go ahead and take a leap of faith and see what happens. Just know From First To Last is responsible for everything I have in my life, good and bad, and as far as I'm concerned it will probably continue to exist until I am too old to do it anymore or dead. We love every single person that has ever helped make our dream of being musicians and traveling the world come true. I know without the people who supported us, we would be nothing and I am eternally grateful for everything. Just know we aren't going to let you guys down and we still plan on making music at some point in the future when it makes sense for all of us.

=== Reunion, introduction of Sotelo and ''Dead Trees'' (2013–2015) ===
In November 2013, Matt Good, Derek Bloom, Matt Manning and Travis Richter reunited as From First to Last and launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to fund the recording of a new EP. Good said he also reached out to Sonny Moore ([[Skrillex]]) to see if he would be interested in contributing in some way.<ref>{{cite web| last = Crane| first = Matt| title = Exclusive Interview: Matt Good on the return of From First To Last and their new EP Kickstarter| work = [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]| date = November 13, 2013| url = http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/exclusive_interview_matt_good_on_the_return_of_from_first_to_last| access-date = November 13, 2013}}</ref> Months after exceeding its crowd-funding goal of $25,000 by raising over $30,000, the band changed its plans slightly: the recording sessions proved fruitful and the band decided to release a full-length album instead of an EP, and the lineup changed significantly. Bloom was no longer a part of the reunion and the remaining members expanded to a six-piece with the addition of vocalist Spencer Sotelo of [[Periphery (band)|Periphery]], drummer Ernie Slenkovich and third guitarist [[Taylor Larson]].<ref>{{cite web| last = Crane| first = Matt| title = Exclusive: From First To Last recruit Periphery's Spencer Sotelo as new vocalist| work = [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]| date = April 7, 2014| url = http://www.altpress.com/aptv/video/exclusive_from_first_to_last_recruit_peripherys_spencer_sotelo_as_new_vocal| access-date = August 18, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last = Tate| first = Jason| title = Taylor Larson Joins From First to Last| work = [[AbsolutePunk]]| publisher = [[Spin Media]]| date = March 27, 2014| url = http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=3695815| access-date = August 18, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last = Vogel| first = Matt| title = From First To Last re-make 2004 hit 'Note To Self'| work = [[idobi Radio]]| date = May 15, 2014| url = http://idobi.com/news/2014/05/from-first-to-last-re-make-2004-hit-note-to-self/| access-date = August 18, 2014}}</ref> With the new lineup, From First to Last recorded and released an online stream of a new version of "Note to Self" – originally released on ''[[Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Bodycount]]'' in 2004 with Moore on vocals – to commemorate its 10-year anniversary.<ref>{{cite web| last = Whitt| first = Cassie| title = Exclusive: From First To Last re-record 2004's 'Note To Self' with new lineup| work = [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]| date = May 14, 2014| url = http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/exclusive_from_first_to_last_re_record_2004s_note_to_self_with_new_lineup| access-date = August 18, 2014}}</ref> In the autumn of 2014, the band continued on with a tour with [[Black Veil Brides]], Set It Off, [[William Control]] and [[Falling in Reverse]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

=== Departure of Sotelo, Moore's return and the future (2016–present) ===
On July 30, 2016, former vocalist Sonny Moore held a radio show on [[Beats 1]] as Skrillex. The final song of the radio show, an untitled bonus track was, according to ''[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]'', reminiscent of prior From First to Last work with Moore's vocals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/from_first_to_last_reunite_with_original_vocalist_sonny_moorehear_possible|title=From First To Last reuniting with vocalist Sonny Moore?—hear possible new song - News - Alternative Press|website=Alternative Press|access-date=2016-08-01}}</ref> The article talked about the rumors being generated by a Facebook post regarding a possible reunion.<ref>{{cite web |author1=From First to Last Official Facebook |title=From First to Last |url=https://www.facebook.com/FromFirstToLast/posts/882492445190835 |website=Facebook.com |access-date=29 August 2018 |date=30 July 2016}}</ref>
