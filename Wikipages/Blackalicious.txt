After graduating from Kennedy High in 1989, the two went their separate ways.

In 1992, during a time when Xcel was attending the [[University of California, Davis]], Gift of Gab joined him in [[Davis, California]] to form Blackalicious. At UC Davis, Xcel had been working with a hip-hop group named [[Solesides]], whose members included [[DJ Shadow]], [[Lateef the Truthspeaker]], and [[Lyrics Born]]. Solesides Records was the name of the collective's Northern California record company, and in 1994 the label released Blackalicious' debut single "Swan Lake", which garnered acclaim within the independent music scene.<ref name="swan lake">{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Blackalicious-Swan-Lake-Lyric-Fathom/release/163270 |title=Blackalicious - Swan Lake at Discogs |publisher=discogs.com}}</ref> In 1995, Blackalicious released an EP titled ''[[Melodica (EP)|Melodica]]'' under Solesides Records.<ref name = "Melodica (MoWax)">{{cite web| title =Blackalicious - Melodica (MoWax) | url=http://www.discogs.com/Blackalicious-Melodica/release/884631 |publisher=[[discogs]] |access-date =21 July 2009}}</ref> By 1997, Solesides Records had transformed into the now acclaimed [[Quannum Projects]], and under this label, the group released a 1999 EP titled ''[[A2G]]'', featuring the hyper-accelerated song "Alphabet Aerobics."<ref>{{cite web|first=Stanton|last=Swihart|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/a2g-mw0000672112|title=A2G - Blackalicious|work=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=January 15, 2015}}</ref> Later that year, the group released its debut full-length debut album ''[[Nia (album)|Nia]]''.<ref name = allmusicnia>{{cite web| title =Blackalicious - Nia | url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/nia-mw0000055569 |publisher=allmusic.com |access-date=February 14, 2015}}</ref> The album was released in Europe by [[Mo' Wax]] on August 30, 1999 and later re-released in the United States by [[Quannum Projects]] on February 29, 2000 with a slightly altered track list.
