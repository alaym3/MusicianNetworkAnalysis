==Legal issues==
=== Criminal Behaviour Order ===
Because of their arrest on 9 November 2017, Digga and 1011 were given a [[Criminal Behaviour Order]] (CBO) in 2018 that required the group to have the [[Metropolitan Police]]'s permission before releasing any new music, forbade them from using London postcodes, and banning references in lyrics to real-life incidents and people. Four of the group's music videos prior to the CBO were taken down. However, they were noted to have amassed over ten million combined views before removal.<ref name="the face"/><ref name="vice"/>

The conditions of Digga's CBO included being fitted with a [[ankle monitor|GPS tracker on his leg]] and being made to check in with probation every three hours, as well as having to notify the Met police when he uploaded any songs or videos, within 24 hours of upload. Any releases that incited violence, mentioning certain areas of London or lyrical references to real-life incidents or people in their music would not be permitted. "There's a list of about 18 to 20 people that Rhys isn't allowed to associate with, most of whom make up his friends from school or friends from his area or people that the police deemed were part of a gang that he was part of", explained Digga's lawyer, Cecilia Goodwin. Moreover, visually, there are certain things which are not allowed to be portrayed.<ref name="bbc" /> Any breach of the CBO would result in a recall to prison.<ref name="bbc"/>

The CBO ban issued to 1011 was condemned by the campaign group [[Index on Censorship]] and widely described as entirely unprecedented.<ref name="guardian war">{{Cite news |last=Hancox |first=Dan |date=22 June 2018 |title=The war against rap: censoring drill may seem radical but it's not new |language=en |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/22/the-war-against-rap-censoring-drill-may-seem-radical-but-its-not-new |access-date=13 January 2021}}</ref> Digga's lawyer noted that the CBO "gives the police and probation the ability to control and censor his art". The Metropolitan Police has since denied it was censorship.<ref name="bbc"/> Det Ch Supt Kevin Southworth said at the time: "When in this instance you see a particular genre of music being used specifically to goad, to incite, to provoke, to inflame, that can only lead to acts of very serious violence being committed, that’s when it becomes a matter for the police. We're not in the business of killing anyone's fun, we're not in the business of killing anyone's artistic expression – we are in the business of stopping people being killed."<ref name="bbc"/><ref name="bbc ladbroke sentenced"/>

=== Other incarcerations ===
He has since been back to prison twice, including for breaching the stringent conditions of his CBO.<ref name="bbc" /> While Digga was recalled to prison in 2019, Digga was stabbed in the eye, causing him to lose use of the eye. He was stabbed with a blade fashioned from a tuna can, according to an official at the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] who was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and who spoke on the condition of anonymity.  Goodwin, his lawyer, said that the rapper had been struggling with [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] after the attack.<ref name="nytimes"/>

In March 2020 Digga D pleaded guilty to [[Violent disorder]] again and breaches of his CBO. He was sentenced to two years and 6 months for his role in a machete brawl with rival gang members in front of shoppers in West London. Other members of CGM were also charged, including Sav'O, who was sentenced to three years' imprisonment after pleading guilty to violent disorder, possession of an offensive weapon and breaches of a CBO.<ref name="evening standard"/>

He was arrested again in July for inciting violence after attending a [[Black Lives Matter]] protest in London and posting about the movement on [[Instagram]]. Right after being released from his previous arrest, rumours circulated that police had taken the rapper back into custody, which was later confirmed. "Again they are on me", the rapper is heard saying in a video as he is being cuffed. "For what? No reason."<ref name="hotnewhiphop">{{Cite news |last=D. |first=Dre |date=16 September 2020 |title=UK Drill Rapper Digga D Arrested Again Immediately After Being Released |language=en |work=HotNewHipHop |url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/uk-drill-rapper-digga-d-arrested-again-immediately-after-being-released-news.117942.html |access-date=14 January 2021}}</ref> He has since been released, still under conditions of his CBO. Asked in an interview with ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'' if he was treated unfairly, he replied: "Oh, of course, 100 per cent, They didn't ban me from music [at first], only as it started hitting millions and [they] saw me prospering from it."<ref name="the face" />
