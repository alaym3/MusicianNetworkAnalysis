'''The Paper Chase''' (stylized as "the pAper chAse") was an American [[alternative rock]] band formed in 1998 by producer/engineer [[John Congleton]] in [[Dallas, Texas]], who were signed to [[Kill Rock Stars]] and [[Southern Records]].<ref name= "cult">{{cite news |last=Reiss |first=Jonathan |url= http://www.imposemagazine.com/features/the-cult-of-the-paper-chase |title=The Cult of The Paper Chase |work=[[Impose (magazine)|Impose]] |date=August 3, 2009 |accessdate=May 9, 2018}}</ref> Their albums ''[[God Bless Your Black Heart]]'' and ''[[Now You Are One of Us]]'' have been released on vinyl by the Austrian label [[Trost Records]]. Since its inception, The Paper Chase has produced a combination of discordant melody and jagged [[noise pop]], described by [[Allmusic]] as "a jagged structure of [[avant-garde jazz]], [[noise music|noise]], [[indie music|indie]], and [[punk rock|punk]]".<ref name="DaRonco">DaRonco, Mike "[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p484679/biography|pure_url=yes}} The Paper Chase Biography]", ''[[Allmusic]]'', Macrovision Corporation</ref>

==History==
Congleton produced all the band's material to date. He also wrote all of the material, with a few exceptions: Bobby Weaver co-wrote "A Face That Could Launch a Thousand Ships" and "Off with Their Heads" from the album ''Young Bodies Heal Quickly, You Know''. Mike Sanger co-wrote "Throw Your Body on the Apparatus", and Elliot Figg co-wrote "When You Least Expect It," both from the aforementioned album.

Their next project would have been a two-part album centered on natural disasters.  The first half, entitled ''Someday This Could All Be Yours (vol. 1 The Calamities)'' was released on May 26, 2009 through Kill Rock Stars Records, though the second part has remained unreleased since the band's dissolution.<ref name= "someday">{{cite news |last=Whelihan |first=Matt |url= https://www.clevescene.com/cleveland/cd-review-the-paper-chase/Content?oid=1574298 |title=CD Review: The Paper Chase, ''Someday This Could All Be Yours Vol. 1'' (Kill Rock Stars) |work=[[Cleveland Scene]] |date=May 27, 2009 |accessdate=May 9, 2018}}</ref>
