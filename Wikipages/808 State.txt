==History==
Martin Price was the owner of Manchester's influential Eastern Bloc Records,<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Bradley|first=Lloyd|date=5 March 1991|title=Genius Plastic|journal=Q Magazine|volume=55|pages=16-17}}</ref> and was also the founder of the [[independent record label]], Creed.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Customers Graham Massey and Gerald Simpson joined with Price to form a [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group called Hit Squad Manchester.<ref name=":0" /> The group shifted to an acid house sound and recorded their debut ''Newbuild'' in 1988, while using the name 808 State for the first time.<ref name=":0" />

''[[Newbuild (album)|Newbuild]]'' was released on Price's own record label. In an interview with [[Mojo (magazine)|''Mojo'' magazine]] in 2005, Graham Massey explained that the album was recorded over the course of a winter weekend in January 1988 at Spirit Studios, Manchester. The album was named after a Bolton housing co-operative. The record was re-released in 2005 on [[Aphex Twin]]'s [[Rephlex Records]]. Aphex Twin was a huge fan of the record: "It was the next step after Chicago acid, and as much as I loved that, I could relate much better to 808 State. It seemed colder and more human at the same time."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuartaitken.com/post/43672088536/808statemojo|title=Acid Muthas Mental|author=Stuart Aitken|work=Mojo Magazine|date=February 2005}}</ref>

Around the same time, the band also recorded an acid house version of [[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s "[[Blue Monday (New Order song)|Blue Monday]]". A favourite at [[The Haçienda]]'s Hot Night, the recording was believed lost until [[Autechre]]'s Sean Booth asked Massey to dig through his archive of old material. The record was released in 2004 by Rephlex Records. "We didn't put a lot of thought into it but maybe that's its charm," said Massey at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2004/10/01/808_state_prebuild_music_feature.shtml|title=Saved from the vaults, back on the decks|author=Stuart Aitken|work=bbc.co.uk|date=October 2004}}</ref>

Massey was also a member of the band Aqua in the early 1990s, along with the violinist [[Graham Clark (violinist)|Graham Clark]], a former pupil of [[Manchester Grammar School]].

The band's song "Pacific State" was released as a [[single (music)|single]], peaking at number 10 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Simpson left the group in 1989 to form his own solo project, [[A Guy Called Gerald]]. At this point, the remaining personnel enlisted DJs Andrew Barker and Darren Partington, known as the Spinmasters, and recorded the [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Quadrastate]]'' in July 1989.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> The group signed to [[ZTT Records|ZZT records]],<ref name=":0" /> and ''[[Ninety (album)|Ninety]]'' was released in December 1989.

[[MC Tunes]] worked with the band on the 1990 album, ''The North at Its Heights''. The album was a moderate success, reaching number 26 in the [[UK Albums Chart]],<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

It spawned three UK singles, "The Only Rhyme That Bites" – featuring a [[sampling (music)|sample]] of "The Big Country" performed by The City of Prague Philharmonic – (UK number 10), "Tunes Splits the Atom" (UK number 18) and "Primary Rhyming" (UK number 67).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> The first two issues credited MC Tunes versus 808 State, whilst the latter was simply MC Tunes.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> Tunes later returned in 1996 to work on a new track, "Pump", taken from 808 State's album ''Thermo Kings''.

808 State's next album was released in 1991, ''[[Ex:el]]'', which featured the vocals of [[Bernard Sumner]] and [[Björk]]. The songs included "In Yer Face" (UK #9), "Cubik" (UK #10) and "Lift" (UK #38).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

In October 1991, Price left the group to perform solo production work, eventually forming his own label, Sun Text. The remaining members released a fourth album called ''[[Gorgeous (808 State album)|Gorgeous]]'', and after that, did some remix work for [[David Bowie]], [[Soundgarden]], and other performers, before returning with the album entitled ''[[Don Solaris]]'' in 1996. It featured contributions from [[James Dean Bradfield]], who sang vocals on "Lopez", which reached number 20 in the UK Singles Chart.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> This song was remixed by [[Brian Eno]]. In 1997, they had remixed the [[Mansun]] track "Skin Up, Pin Up" for the [[Spawn (1997 film)|Spawn]] soundtrack. The song "Bond" featured vocals by [[Mike Doughty]] from the band [[Soul Coughing]] and "Azura" featured [[Lou Rhodes]] from [[Lamb (electronic band)|Lamb]]. They released a [[greatest hits]] [[compilation album]], ''[[808:88:98]]'' in 1998. In 2000, ''Newbuild'' was re-released.

Some of the band's work, particularly in the albums ''Ex:el'' and ''Gorgeous'' show their [[New wave music|new wave]] influences by sampling or featuring new wave icons such as [[Bernard Sumner]] on the song "Spanish Heart" and [[Ian McCulloch (singer)|Ian McCulloch]] on "Moses". The song "Contrique" samples the bassline to [[Joy Division]]'s "[[She's Lost Control]]" and "10 X 10" is a gospel-house track built on the foundation of [[The Jam]]'s "[[Start!]]".<ref>{{cite web|last=Wood |first=Sam |url=http://articles.philly.com/1993-02-09/entertainment/25956120_1_dance-floor-tommy-boy-album |title=808 State Defies The Odds Again with a Consistently Fine Album - Philly.com |publisher=Articles.philly.com |date=1993-02-09 |access-date=2013-09-14}}</ref>

In 2003, they released ''[[Outpost Transmission]]'' which featured guest collaborations from the [[Alabama 3]] and [[Guy Garvey]] from [[Elbow (band)|Elbow]].

In May 2008, the re-issue of the album ''[[Quadrastate]]'' completed a trilogy of pre-ZTT releases on CD for the first time.

Partington left the band after being jailed for 18 months in January 2015 for dealing [[heroin]] and [[crack cocaine]].<ref name="bbc.co.uk">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-30743371 808 State DJ Darren Partington jailed for drug dealing] ''[[BBC News]]'', 9 January 2015.
