==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Lofgren was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States,<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|pages=1506/7}}</ref> to an Italian mother and a Swedish father. When he was a young child, the family moved to the Washington, D.C., suburb of [[Bethesda, Maryland]].<ref name="wapo-nils-six">{{cite news |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postrock/2008/10/six_questions_and_then_some_fo_2.html |title=Six Questions (And Then Some) For ... Nils Lofgren |author=J. Freedom du Lac |work=The Washington Post |date=October 8, 2008 |access-date=November 11, 2008}}</ref> Lofgren's first instrument was classical [[accordion]], beginning at age five,<ref name="Allmusic1">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p4776|pure_url=yes}} |title=Nils Lofgren Biography |last=Huey |first=Steve |year=2009 |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=March 14, 2009}}</ref> which he studied seriously for ten years.<ref name="wapo-nils-six"/> After studying classical music and [[jazz]], throughout his youth, Lofgren switched his emphasis to rock music, and focused on the piano and the guitar.<ref name="Allmusic1" />

Lofgren had been a competitive gymnast in high school, a skill that was used on stage later in his performing career and reflected in the name of his 1985 album, [[Flip (album)|''Flip'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.djnoble.demon.co.uk/ints/NILSLOF.GRE.html |title=Nils Lofgren Interview |website=Djnoble.demon.co.uk |access-date=February 14, 2011}}</ref>

===Grin===
In 1968, Lofgren formed the band Grin with bassist [[George Daly (Music Industry)|George Daly]] (later replaced by Bob Gordon), and drummer Bob Berberich, former players in the DC band The Hangmen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garagehangover.com/?q=Hangmen |title=The Hangmen |website=Garagehangover.com |access-date=2012-03-29}}</ref> The group played in venues throughout the Washington, D.C., area.

Lofgren met [[Neil Young]] while Young was performing at the Georgetown club [[The Cellar Door]], and began a long association. Young invited Lofgren to come to California and the Grin trio (Lofgren, Daly and Berberich) drove out west and lived for some months at a home Neil Young rented in [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles|Laurel Canyon]]. Lofgren would eventually use his album credits from working with Young to land Grin a record deal in 1971. 

Daly left the band early on to become a Columbia Records A&R Executive and was replaced by bassist Bob Gordon, who remained through the release of four critically acclaimed albums<ref name="ocRegister">{{cite news |url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/lofgren-neil-young-2293298-band-time |title=Nils Lofgren marks 25 years with Springsteen |last=Kinsler |first=Robert |date=January 28, 2009 |work=Orange County Register |access-date=March 14, 2009}}</ref> of catchy hard rock from 1971 to 1974, with guitar as Lofgren's primary instrument. The single  "White Lies" got heavy airplay on Washington, D.C.-area radio. Lofgren wrote the majority of the group's songs, and often shared vocal duties with other members of the band (primarily drummer Bob Berberich). After the second album he added brother Tom Lofgren as a rhythm guitarist. Grin failed to hit the big time, and were released by their record company.<ref name="wapo-nils-six" />

===Neil Young and Crazy Horse===
Lofgren joined Young's band at age 19, playing piano and guitar on the album ''[[After the Gold Rush]]''.<ref name="wapo-nils-six" /> Lofgren maintained a close musical relationship with Young, appearing on his ''[[Tonight's the Night (Neil Young album)|Tonight's the Night]]'' album and tour among others.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> He has also been a recurring member of [[Crazy Horse (band)|Crazy Horse]] (1970–1971; 1973; 2018–present), appearing on their [[Crazy Horse (album)|1971 LP]] and contributing songs to their catalogue. In 2018, Lofgren re-joined Crazy Horse and along with the band performed on Young's 2019 album, ''[[Colorado (Neil Young album)|Colorado]]'' and 2021's ''[[Barn (album)|Barn]]''.

===Solo career===
After Grin disbanded in 1974, Lofgren released his [[Nils Lofgren (album)|eponymous debut]] solo album  which was a success with critics; a 1975 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' review by [[Jon Landau]] labeled it one of the finest rock albums of the year, and ''[[NME]]'' ranked it fifth on its list of albums of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/1975.html |title=Rocklist.net...NME End of Year Lists 1975 |website=Rocklistmusic.co.uk |date=May 9, 1992 |access-date=February 14, 2011}}</ref> Subsequent albums did not always garner critical favor,<ref>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1826843|first=Joe|last=Viglione}}</ref> although ''[[Cry Tough (Nils Lofgren album)|Cry Tough]]'' was voted number 10 in the 1976 NME Album round up;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/1976.html |title=Rocklist.net...NME End of Year Lists 1976 |website=Rocklistmusic.co.uk |date=May 9, 1992 |access-date=February 14, 2011}}</ref> ''[[I Came to Dance]]'' in particular received a scathing review in the ''[[New Rolling Stone Record Guide]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Marsh|first1=Dave|last2=Swenson|first2=John|title=New Rolling Stone Record Guide, The|year=1983|publisher=Random House/Rolling Stone Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-394-72107-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstoner00mars/page/302 302]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/newrollingstoner00mars/page/302}}</ref> He achieved [[progressive rock (radio format)|progressive rock radio]] hits in the mid-1970s with "Back It Up", "Keith Don't Go" and "I Came to Dance". His song "Bullets Fever", about the [[Washington Wizards#Miracle 1977–78 season|1978 NBA champion]] [[Washington Bullets]], would become a favorite in the Washington area.<ref name="wapo-nils-six" /> Throughout the 1970s, Lofgren released solo albums and toured extensively with a backing band that usually included brother Tom on rhythm guitar. Lofgren's concerts displayed his reputation for theatrics, such as playing guitar while doing flips on a [[trampoline]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

In 1971, he appeared on stage on the [[Roy Buchanan]] Special, [[Public Broadcast Service|PBS TV]], with [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]]. In 1973, he appeared with Grin on NBC on ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|Midnight Special]]'', performing three songs live. In 1978, he wrote and sang the "Nobody Bothers Me" theme for a D.C. [[Jhoon Rhee]] [[Tae Kwon Do]] advertisement, and also appeared in the ill-received ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (film)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' movie. Lofgren appeared on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', to promote his 1985 solo release ''Flip''. Lofgren is credited on two of [[Lou Gramm]]'s (of Foreigner) solo albums: ''Ready or Not'' released in 1987 (Lofgren listed as lead guitarist) and ''Long Hard Look'' released in 1989 (Lofgren listed as one of the guitarists). In 1987, he contributed the television show theme arrangement for ''[[Hunter (1984 U.S. TV series)|Hunter]]''. In 1993 he contributed to ''[[The Simpsons]]'', with two Christmas jingles with Bart. In 1995, he appeared on a PBS tribute to [[the Beatles]] along with [[Dr. John]]. From 1991 to 1995, he was the CableAce Awards musical director and composer.

Lofgren continues to record and to tour as a solo act, with [[Patti Scialfa]], with Neil Young, and as a two-time member of [[Ringo Starr]]'s [[Ringo Starr All-Starr Band|All-Starr Band]]. Many of the people he worked with on those tours appeared on his 1991 album, ''Silver Lining''. During the 2000s he got his own "Nils Lofgren Day" in [[Montgomery County, Maryland]] (August 25). In 2006 Lofgren released ''Sacred Weapon'', featuring guest appearances by [[David Crosby]], [[Graham Nash]], [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Martin Sexton]]. In 2006 he recorded a live DVD ''Nils Lofgren & Friends: Acoustic Live'' at the Legendary Birchmere Music Hall in [[Alexandria, Virginia]].

On June 23, 2006, Lofgren performed at a benefit concert for [[Arthur Lee (musician)|Arthur Lee]] at New York's [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theater]], along with [[Robert Plant]], [[Ian Hunter (singer)|Ian Hunter]], [[Yo La Tengo]] and [[Garland Jeffreys]]. In 2007, he appeared playing guitar as part of [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]' backing band for Lewis' ''[[Last Man Standing Live]]'' concert DVD. He released ''The Loner&nbsp;– Nils Sings Neil'', an album of acoustic covers of Neil Young songs, in 2008.

In September 2008, Lofgren had [[hip replacement surgery]] for both of his hips as a result of years of playing basketball, "performance 'flips' on stage, and age."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.411mania.com/music/news/94981/Springsteen-Guitarist-Talks-About-The-Super-Bowl.htm |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |title=Nils Lofgren on John Madden, the Cardinals and a brand new set of hips... |date=January 2009 |access-date=January 24, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204192743/http://411mania.com/music/news/94981/Springsteen-Guitarist-Talks-About-The-Super-Bowl.htm |archive-date=February 4, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In August 2014, a box set, ''Face the Music'', was released on the Fantasy label. The career-spanning retrospective contains nine CD's and a DVD covering 45 years.

The creation of Lofgren's 2015 live album ''UK 2015 Face the Music Tour'' was inspired by his wife Amy commenting that his recent live shows were the best she'd seen him do, as well as fans wanting to have a recording of the show they’d just seen.<ref name="River" />

In December 2018, [[PBS NewsHour]] aired a 10-minute career retrospective ''Nils Lofgren: 50 years of ‘just being a guy in the band’''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/nils-lofgren-50-years-of-just-being-a-guy-in-the-band |title=Nils Lofgren on PBS NewsHour |website=Pbs.org|date=December 15, 2018}}</ref>

Lofgren was a guest on a "Private Lives" 1 hour radio special on East London Radio in the UK in October 2020. This series is shared across radio stations online and on FM/DAB, covering much of the UK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mixcloud.com/EastLondonRadio/private-lives-nils-lofgren/|title=Mixcloud|website=Mixcloud.com|access-date=September 26, 2021}}</ref>

[[File:WMMS Presents Southside Johnny - 1976 print ad.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Print ad for Southside Johnny rock concert featuring Lofgren as guest]]
In 1984, he joined [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s backing band the [[E Street Band]],<ref name="LarkinGE"/> as the replacement for [[Steven Van Zandt]] on guitar and vocals, in time for Springsteen's [[Born in the U.S.A. Tour]]. Lofgren would appear on his first Springsteen album with 1987's ''[[Tunnel of Love (album)|Tunnel of Love]]'' and its [[Tunnel of Love Express]] and [[Human Rights Now!]] supporting tours. In 1989 Springsteen broke up the E Street Band and Lofgren returned to his solo work. 

In 1995, the E Street Band, featuring both Lofgren and Van Zandt, recorded new songs for Springsteen's ''[[Greatest Hits (Bruce Springsteen album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album however nothing else came from this reunion. In 1999, Springsteen, minus the E Street Band, was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. The E Street Band would finally be inducted fifteen years later in 2014. Despite not being inducted in 1999 with Springsteen, the E Street Band (again with Lofren and Van Zandt) would perform with Springsteen for the first time since 1988 at the induction ceremony. This would soon lead to a hugely successful [[Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band Reunion Tour|Reunion Tour]] which took place from 1999-2000 and a lineup now featuring both Lofgren and Van Zandt as full-time members. The reunion tour resulted in 2001's album,''[[The Rising (album)|The Rising]]'', marking the first album featuring the E Street Band since 1988, and another [[The Rising Tour|huge tour in 2002 and 2003]]. Following this tour, Springsteen would work on other projects and tour without the E Street Band's involvement until 2007's ''[[Magic (Bruce Springsteen album)|Magic]]'' album and [[Magic Tour (Bruce Springsteen)|tour of 2007/2008]]. This tour was followed by 2009's ''[[Working on a Dream]]'' album and  [[Working on a Dream Tour|tour]]. In 2012, Springsteen released his album, ''[[Wrecking Ball (Bruce Springsteen album)|Wrecking Ball]]'', which featured some of the E Street Band member however Lofgren did not appear though he did perform with the band on the album's [[Wrecking Ball Tour|supporting tour]]. 2014 saw the release of the album ''[[High Hopes (album)|High Hopes]]'' along with another [[High Hopes Tour|tour]]. In 2016, Springsteen would celebrate the 35th anniversary of his album, ''[[The River (Bruce Springsteen album)|The River]]'', with a  [[The River Tour (2016)|tour]] in support of ''[[The Ties_That_Bind: The_River_Collection]]'' box set.<ref name="River">{{cite news|url= https://www.mcall.com/mc-nils-lofgren-bruce-springsteen-phillly-20160206-story.html|title= Nils Lofgren on playing with Springsteen: 'Every night I learn stuff and grow'|work=[[The Morning Call]]|last=Moser|first=John J.|date=February 8, 2016|access-date=February 15, 2021}}</ref>In 2020, Springsteen released his album, ''[[Letter to You]]'' which featured the E Street Band. Due to the [[Covid-19 pandemic]], a tour in support of the album was unable to happen in 2020 or 2021 however Springsteen has said he hopes to tour with the E Street Band at some point in 2022.

===Other work===
The late novelist [[Clive Cussler]] lived close to Lofgren's Arizona home, and collaborated on a song with him titled "What Ever Happened to Muscatel?"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nilslofgren.com/store07.html |title=Nils Lofgren Merchandise |website=Nilslofgren.com |access-date=February 14, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101085743/http://nilslofgren.com/store07.html |archive-date=January 1, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On August 17, 2017, Lofgren was inducted into the Arizona Music & Entertainment Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony 2017|url=http://www.azcentral.com/picture-gallery/entertainment/music/2017/08/18/arizona-music--entertainment-hall-of-fame-induction-ceremony-2017/104714678/#|website=Azcentral.com|access-date=October 9, 2017|language=en}}</ref>
