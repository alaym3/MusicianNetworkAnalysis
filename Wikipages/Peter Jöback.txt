==Biography==

=== Early life and education ===
As a student Jöback attended the [[Adolf Fredrik's Music School]] in Stockholm.<ref name="DN 121024">{{cite web |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/ledare/ledarkronika/evafranchell/article15664562.ab |title=Alliansen premierar lärare i "fina" skolor |author= Eva Franchell |publisher=Dagens Nyheter (Swedish daily newspaper) |date=24 October 2012 |access-date=24 November 2014 }}</ref>

=== 1995–2000 ===
Peter Jöback got his big break through his collaboration with [[ABBA]]'s [[Björn Ulvaeus]] and [[Benny Andersson]]. In their musical ''[[Kristina från Duvemåla]]'' (''The Emigrants'') at [[Malmö Opera and Music Theatre]], Jöback created the role of Robert, whose theme song ("Guldet blev till sand") broke every record in the Swedish charts. The musical was seen by over one million Swedes, and the original cast CD-box became a triple-platinum album and received several Swedish Grammy awards. Jöback received his first Golden Mask for his role as Robert.

In 1997, Jöback released the album "[[Personliga Val]]", which reached number two on the Swedish album chart.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hitparad.se/showitem.asp?interpret=Peter+J%F6back&titel=Personliga+val&cat=a|title = Hitparad.se - SverigeTopplistan}}</ref> It featured 11 pop-oriented interpretations of songs from famous musicals.

Cameron Mackintosh discovered Jöback's talent and offered him the lead as Chris in ''[[Miss Saigon]]'' at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in London's West End, in 1997. Three years later, at the same theatre, Jöback created the role of Michael in Macintosh's original production of ''[[The Witches of Eastwick (musical)|The Witches of Eastwick]]''.

=== 2000–2005 ===
In September 2000 Peter Jöback released ''[[Only When I Breathe]]'' which was his first studio album in English. The album reached number one on the Swedish album charts.<ref>http://swedishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Peter+J%F6back+%26+G%F6teborgs+Symfoniker&titel=Storybook&cat=a</ref>

His many stage performances and albums have been met with critical acclaim.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Jöback's Christmas album was released in 2002. On this album Jöback teamed up with Norwegian singer [[Sissel Kyrkjebø]] in a duet of the Irish folk song "Be thou my vision" in a Swedish translation titled "Gå Inte Förbi". The duo have since been frequent guests at each other's concerts.

In 2004 Jöback collaborated with [[Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by Nick Davies in a project called ''Storybook'' where he performed classic songs in brand new arrangements. GSO and Jöback released a CD which became a Gold Disc and also performed two concerts in the [[Globe Arena]] and Scandinavium Arena in Sweden. The album also brought Jöback to a superstar status in Norway. His first solo tour there in 2005 was a success both with audience and media.

=== 2006–2009===
During 2006–2007 Peter Jöback starred as the MC in a production of ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'' in [[Stockholm]] and [[Gothenburg]]. He received critical praise as well as his second Golden Mask Tony Award. He already in 2003 performed as the MC at Gladsaxe Theatre in Copenhagen.

Jöback ended 2008 with a sold-out Christmas tour in arenas in [[Scandinavia]] following the release of a new 4x platinum-selling Christmas album. In 2007 he also toured Scandinavia with his platinum-selling studio album with original songs co-written by himself. In January 2009 Jöback moved to New York City to get new inspiration and make new acquaintances. This has resulted in an album entitled ''East Side Stories'', recorded in Woodstock, featuring prominent guests such as Kate Pierson from [[The B52's]], Sia Furler, Gail Ann Dorsey and the group Betty.

=== 2010–present ===
Peter Jöback entered [[Melodifestivalen 2010]], the Swedish Pre-selection for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010]]. He received a wildcard from [[Sveriges Television|SVT]]. His song, "Hollow", reached the final of the competition, ultimately finishing in 9th position. In 2011, Jöback performed in the finale of ''[[The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall]]''. In 2012 Jöback starred as the Phantom in the London production of ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''. He repeated the role on Broadway in April 2013.  His last performance as Phantom on Broadway was on 24 August 2013, when Hugh Panaro took over the role again. However, he has since returned to bring the Phantom to his homeland. The show premiered in September 2016 in Stockholm. In January 2018, Jöback took over the role of the Phantom on Broadway for the 30th Anniversary, alongside [[Ali Ewoldt]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Peter Jöback återvänder till Broadway för exklusivt "THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA" 30-årsjubileum!|url=http://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/helenewigrenprbeyond/pressreleases/peter-joeback-aatervaender-till-broadway-foer-exklusivt-the-phantom-of-the-opera-30-aarsjubileum-2267575|date=15 November 2017|website=[[MyNewsDesk]]|language=sv|access-date=17 May 2020}}</ref>
