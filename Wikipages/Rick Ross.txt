===2009: ''Deeper Than Rap''===
{{Main|Deeper Than Rap|}}
<blockquote>I look at the game and the business and all different aspects, it's a lot of great lyricists on the corner that will never properly understand the business and know how to market themselves and get in a position where they can gain capital. I look at all the strategies people use and what made them successful. What made Birdman just as relevant today after selling 50 million records? That intrigues me. To see the class of Jay-Z, his accomplishments and see how he sits backs and accurately makes his moves.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1608776/20090407/story.jhtml Rick Ross Is 'Competing For The Throne' With Deeper Than Rap] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110043142/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1608776/20090407/story.jhtml |date=January 10, 2010 }}, Mtv.com</ref></blockquote>

A track from the album called "Valley of Death" was what stood out to MTV reporters. In the song, Ross speaks briefly on his controversial stint as a prison guard. "Keep it trilla, nigga, never had a gun and badge," which he stresses, leaving the word that he was indeed an officer of the law. "Kept a nice watch, smoking on a hundred sack/ Back in the day I sold crack for some nice kicks/ Skippin' school, I saw my friend stabbed with an ice pick/ Can't criticize niggas trying to get jobs/ Better get smart, young brother, live yours." Later, he implies that while he was working as a corrections officer, he was on the streets. "Only lived once and I got two kids/ And for me to feed them, I'll get two gigs," he raps. "I'll shovel shit, I'll C.O./ So we can bow our heads and pray over the meatloaf." He still provided no explanation for lying about being a C.O. to begin with, nor did he explain why he failed to pay child support for his children.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1609204/20090414/ross__rick__rap_.jhtml Rick Ross Justifies Prison-Guard Past In New Track – Listen Here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417035051/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1609204/20090414/ross__rick__rap_.jhtml |date=April 17, 2009 }}, Mtv.com</ref><ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1610106/20090427/ross__rick__rap_.jhtml Rick Ross' 'Valley Of Death' Was Intended For Jay-Z] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717120151/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1610106/20090427/ross__rick__rap_.jhtml |date=July 17, 2009 }}, Mtv.com</ref>

The cover of the May 2009 issue of [[XXL magazine|''XXL'' magazine]], titled "Rick Ross Up in Smoke", featured Ross wearing a pair of [[Louis Vuitton]] sunglasses.

In January 2008, Ross was arrested on gun and marijuana charges. During a deposition of Officer Rey Hernandez, a Miami Beach cop who arrested Ross, Ross's lawyer, Allan Zamren, asked Hernandez why Ross's case was assigned to the gang task force. The officer stated that it was because Ross claimed affiliation with [[Triple C's]] (aka Carol City Cartel), and other known gang members. Zamren pressed Hernandez for a personal link between Ross and the gang members, but the officer did not provide proof.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rick Ross' Own Lawyer De-Values |url=http://highbridnation.com/2009/02/10/rick-ross-own-lawyer-de-values-his-gangsta/ |publisher=Highbridnation.com |date=February 10, 2009 |access-date=March 24, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213102229/http://highbridnation.com/2009/02/10/rick-ross-own-lawyer-de-values-his-gangsta |archive-date=February 13, 2009 }}</ref>

===Feud with 50 Cent===

There were several lines that seemed to diss 50 Cent. Days later, 50 Cent released "Officer Ricky (Go Head, Try Me)" in response to Ross's disparaging remarks on his "Mafia Music" song.

Before going to [[Venezuela]], 50 Cent uploaded a video entitled "Warning Shot", wherein he stated: "Rick Ross- I'mma fuck your life up for fun." In addition, 50 Cent released the first of a series of "Officer Ricky" cartoons. Early in February, 50 Cent once again made a video which he uploaded to YouTube in which he interviewed "Tia", the mother of one of Ross's children.

He stated that he does not wish to speak on him anymore, and that he is done with the feud.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Harling|first=Danielle|title=Rick Ross "Through Talking About" 50 Cent|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.28096/title.rick-ross-through-talking-about-50-cent|magazine=HipHopDX|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140401123036/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.28096/title.rick-ross-through-talking-about-50-cent|archive-date=April 1, 2014}}</ref>

His feud with 50 Cent has been resurfacing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/meek-mill-disses-50-cent-on-gave-em-hope-news.19660.html|title=50 Cent and Rick Ross beef resurfacing|publisher=Hotnewhiphop.com|date=January 16, 2016|access-date=January 17, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119185111/http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/meek-mill-disses-50-cent-on-gave-em-hope-news.19660.html|archive-date=January 19, 2016}}</ref> The reason of the second reignition would be because of Ross's MMG record-label artist [[Meek Mill]], who defended his mentor and criticised 50 on his ''4/4'' EP.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.rap-up.com/2016/02/01/50-cent-disses-meek-mill-at-nyc-show/ |title=50 Cent Disses Meek Mill: 'All You Can Do Is Run to Nicki' |magazine=Rap-Up |access-date=March 15, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415142357/http://www.rap-up.com/2016/02/01/50-cent-disses-meek-mill-at-nyc-show/ |archive-date=April 15, 2017  }}</ref>

===Lyric controversy===
In a line on rapper [[Rocko (rapper)|Rocko]]'s 2013 song "[[U.O.E.N.O.]]", Rick Ross raps the line, "Put molly all in her champagne/ She ain't even know it/ I took her home and I enjoyed that/ She ain't even know it." A petition containing 72,000 signatures was presented to [[Reebok]], demanding they drop Ross as a spokesman for the lyrics which appeared to condone [[date rape]]. Ross has apologized for the lyrics, claiming they weren't about rape.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Rick-Ross-rape-lyric-apology-not-accepted/tabid/418/articleID/293110/Default.aspx| work= 3 News NZ| title= Rick Ross rape lyric apology not accepted| date= April 5, 2013| url-status=live| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131224121936/http://www.3news.co.nz/Rick-Ross-rape-lyric-apology-not-accepted/tabid/418/articleID/293110/Default.aspx| archive-date= December 24, 2013| df= mdy-all}}</ref>

On April 11, 2013, one month after the song's release, Ross was dropped by Reebok.<ref>{{cite news|title=RICK ROSS REEBOK GIVES RAPPER THE BOOT|url=https://www.tmz.com/2013/04/11/reebok-dumps-rick-ross-drops/|work=TMZ|access-date=April 11, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413111416/http://www.tmz.com/2013/04/11/reebok-dumps-rick-ross-drops/|archive-date=April 13, 2013}}</ref> Reebok stated, "while we do not believe that Rick Ross condones sexual assault, we are very disappointed he has yet to display an understanding of the seriousness of this issue or an appropriate level of remorse."  They continued on to say, "at this time, it is in everyone's best interest for Reebok to end its partnership with Mr. Ross.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/rick-ross-loses-reebok-endorsement-over-rape-lyrics-233402/|title=Rick Ross Loses Reebok Endorsement Over 'Rape' Lyrics|last=Danton|first=Eric|date=April 12, 2013|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=May 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/12/rick-ross-loses-reebok-deal|title=Rick Ross loses Reebok deal over 'date rape' verse|date=2013|website=The Guardian|access-date=May 7, 2019}}</ref>"

Though Ross apologized for the lyrics, he also argued that his lyrics were misinterpreted because he did not directly use the word "rape." He says, "You know I would never use the term rape in my records&nbsp;… in reality some people do these things, and shouldn't it be brought to light so young women can protect themselves?!"  He continued on Twitter, "I would never use the term 'rape' in my records and as far as my camp.  Hip-Hop don't condone that, the streets don't condone that, nobody condones that."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/6wg4y6/question-of-the-day-is-rick-ross-a-misogynist|title=Question Of The Day - Is Rick Ross a Misogynist?|last=Gadiano|first=Jerry|date=April 15, 2013|website=Vice|access-date=May 7, 2019}}</ref>

A 2013 Ross concert organized by the student association of [[Carleton University]] was cancelled after protests that his lyrics promote [[rape culture]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.charlatan.ca/2013/04/former-cusa-prez-running-company-behind-rick-ross-concert/ |title=Rick Ross concert completely cancelled following criticism &#124; Charlatan |publisher=Charlatan.ca |access-date=August 6, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523093356/http://charlatan.ca/2013/04/former-cusa-prez-running-company-behind-rick-ross-concert/ |archive-date=May 23, 2013  }}</ref> Rocko later dropped the Rick Ross verse in order to get radio play.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Rocko-replaces-Rick-Ross-rap/tabid/418/articleID/293956/Default.aspx| work= 3 News NZ| title= Rocko replaces Rick Ross rap| date= April 12, 2013| url-status=live| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140102193644/http://www.3news.co.nz/Rocko-replaces-Rick-Ross-rap/tabid/418/articleID/293956/Default.aspx| archive-date= January 2, 2014| df= mdy-all}}</ref>

=== Comment on female rappers ===
In 2017, Ross was criticized for stating in an interview that he never signed a female rapper because "I would end up fucking [her] and fucking the business up."<ref name=mistake>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/rick-ross-insensitive-comments-about-female-rappers-were-mistake-195084/|title=Rick Ross: 'Insensitive' Comments About Female Rappers Were 'Mistake'|last1=Reed|first1=Ryan|date=July 28, 2017|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=May 2, 2019}}</ref> Ross quickly apologized through a Facebook post where he called his comments "insensitive" and a "mistake [he regrets]."<ref name=mistake />
