'''The Dillinger Escape Plan''' was an American <!--please DON'T change to mathcore, metalcore was agreed upon in the talk pages-->[[metalcore]] band. The band was formed in 1997 in [[Morris Plains, New Jersey]] by guitarist [[Ben Weinman]], bassist Adam Doll, vocalist [[Dimitri Minakakis]], and drummer [[Chris Pennie]]. The band's use of [[odd time signatures]], [[polyrhythms]] and unconventional drum patterns became a staple of their sound, although later albums incorporated more melody, and influences from a range of genres. The Dillinger Escape Plan's final lineup consisted of founding member Weinman, longtime bassist [[Liam Wilson]], vocalist [[Greg Puciato]] and drummer [[Billy Rymer]], alongside rhythm guitarist Kevin Antreassian.

The Dillinger Escape Plan achieved critical success, releasing six studio albums during its existence, the first being ''[[Calculating Infinity]]'' (1999), which has been noted by critics as a landmark release in [[hardcore punk]] and [[heavy metal music]]. The album has achieved a cult status selling well over 100,000 copies, which made the band the highest-selling artist on [[Relapse Records|Relapse]] at the time.<ref name="exclaim">{{cite magazine|last=Walschots|first=Natalie Zina|date=June 17, 2013|title=The Dillinger Escape Plan: Hazard Warning|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/dillinger_escape_plan-hazard_warning|magazine=[[Exclaim!]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807022836/http://exclaim.ca/music/article/dillinger_escape_plan-hazard_warning|archive-date=August 7, 2017|access-date=September 5, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The Dillinger Escape Plan has won various nominations from award shows and publications such as the [[PLUG Independent Music Awards]], ''[[Kerrang!]]'', [[Revolver (magazine)|''Revolver'']] and ''[[Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards|Metal Hammer]]''. In 2017, the band won an [[Association of Independent Music|AIM]] Award for "Outstanding Contribution to Music".

Prior to the release of their final album, ''[[Dissociation (album)|Dissociation]]'' (2016), The Dillinger Escape Plan announced that they would be disbanding at the end of the album's touring cycle. Their final shows took place at [[Terminal 5 (venue)|Terminal 5]] in New York City from December 27–29, 2017.

==History==
=== As Arcane (1996) ===
The Dillinger Escape Plan evolved from the [[hardcore punk]] band Arcane. Arcane was an aggressive, political-oriented act formed in 1996 by vocalists [[Dimitri Minakakis]] and Brad McMahon, guitarist [[Ben Weinman]], bassist Bruce Fulton and drummer [[Chris Pennie]].<ref name="hazard">{{cite web|url=https://exclaim.ca/music/article/dillinger_escape_plan-hazard_warning|title=The Dillinger Escape Plan {{!}} Hazard Warning|author=Natalie Zina Walschots|website=[[Exclaim!]]|archive-url=https://archive.today/20171210072225/https://exclaim.ca/music/article/dillinger_escape_plan-hazard_warning|archive-date=December 10, 2017|url-status=live|access-date=December 10, 2017|date=June 17, 2013}}</ref> Arcane played for a few months but eventually disbanded because they "were kinda sick of trying to become part of a clique and to write music that would fit into a theme", according to Weinman.<ref name="ug 2013">{{cite web|access-date=December 10, 2017|title=Dillinger Escape Plan's Ben Weinman: 'We Never Want to Be An Assembly Line of Riffs'|url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/interviews/dillinger_escape_plans_ben_weinman_we_never_want_to_be_an_assembly_line_of_riffs.html|website=[[Ultimate Guitar Archive]]|date=April 16, 2013 |first=Steven |last=Rosen|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20171210121114/https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/interviews/dillinger_escape_plans_ben_weinman_we_never_want_to_be_an_assembly_line_of_riffs.html|archive-date=December 10, 2017}}</ref> Encouraged by him, they turned around their sound and aesthetic, with bassist Adam Doll, who was Pennie's bandmate in the bands Samsara and Malfactor, becoming interested in their new direction and hence joining the band.<ref name="ug 2013"/> Guitarist Derek Brantley also joined the band following the departure of McMahon and Fulton.<ref name=hazard/>

=== Early years and ''Calculating Infinity'' (1997–1999) ===
Their first live performance, which they also considered the last of Arcane, was as a support act for [[Overcast (band)|Overcast]] and organized by long time friend Matt Backerman.<ref name="sing365">{{cite web|last=Apostolopoulos|first=Tom |url=http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Dillinger-Escape-Plan-Biography/EDEAB9F3FFF02E6348256CEA000DD6C2|title=Dillinger Escape Plan Biography|date=January 18, 2011|website=Sing365.com|access-date=March 6, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130202052253/http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Dillinger-Escape-Plan-Biography/EDEAB9F3FFF02E6348256CEA000DD6C2|archive-date=February 2, 2013}}</ref> Backerman had just decided to form Now or Never records and asked the band to record what would be their [[The Dillinger Escape Plan (EP)|self titled six-track EP]].<ref name="org">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dillingerescapeplan.org/content/band-history|title=band history|website=Dillingerescapeplan.org|language=en|access-date=August 14, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20150329014659/http://www.dillingerescapeplan.org/content/band-history|archive-date=March 29, 2015}}</ref> Their second show was supporting [[Earth Crisis]] in Moosic, Pennsylvania.<ref name="sing365" /> They were nameless for many months until, without much thought, friend Matt Makowski suggested the name "The Dillinger Escape Plan" while watching a documentary on [[John Dillinger]], a 1930s bank robber notorious for his multiple escapes from jail.<ref name="sing365" /> Weinman telephoned [[Steve Evetts]] to produce their album because he was a big fan of his work.{{sfn|Farris|2011|loc=2:16:47}} After their first two shows, Brantley lost contact with the band and did not show up when they were recording the six song self-titled effort, causing them to record as a quartet.<ref name="org" />

The six-track EP was released in April 1997, and set them off on a small club tour around northeast America. Shortly before their first tour as The Dillinger Escape Plan, the group was joined by guitarist John Fulton, who previously played in the bands Samsara and Malfactor with Pennie and Doll.<ref name="ug 2013"/><ref name="sing365"/> In 1998 the band wrote and recorded their second EP titled ''[[Under the Running Board]]''. During this time period, The Dillinger Escape Plan gained notoriety in the hardcore punk scene for the intensity of their performances which were increasingly wild, and often violent. These features, as well as the creative, technical approach of their music led a record executive of [[Relapse Records]] to offer the band a multi-record contract.<ref name="sing365"/> Shortly before signing, the ''Under the Running Board'' [[Demo (music)|demo]] was shown to some friends, one of whom was [[Jesuit (band)|Jesuit]] vocalist and guitarist [[Nate Newton (musician)|Nate Newton]] who was impressed with their musical proficiency and invited The Dillinger Escape Plan to an American and Canadian tour with them and [[Botch (band)|Botch]].<ref>{{cite web|access-date=January 18, 2018|title=That Tour Was Awesome – Botch/Jesuit/The Dillinger Escape Plan (1998)|date=January 12, 2017 |first=Kevin |last=Stewart-Panko|url=https://www.decibelmagazine.com/2017/01/12/that-tour-was-awesome-botch-jesuit-the-dillinger-escape-plan-1998/|website=[[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20180118095821/https://www.decibelmagazine.com/2017/01/12/that-tour-was-awesome-botch-jesuit-the-dillinger-escape-plan-1998/|archive-date=January 18, 2018}}</ref>

Shortly after their second EP, John Fulton left the band to focus on his [[computer programming]] studies.{{sfn|Mudrian|Stewart-Panko|2009|p=305}} Before the recording of ''[[Calculating Infinity]]'', bassist Adam Doll was involved in a car accident that left him paralyzed from the chest down.<ref name=blistering>{{cite web|url=http://www.blistering.com/fastpage/fpengine.php/link/1/templateid/6841/tempidx/5/menuid/3|title=Donnelly, Justin.

=== Search for a new vocalist and ''Irony Is a Dead Scene'' (2000–2002) ===
After several months of touring, including appearances on the [[Warped Tour]] and March Metal Meltdown, the band and Wood parted ways, with Wood moving on to his own project, Shat, and [[Liam Wilson]] took his place. Later that same year, the band parted ways with Minakakis.

In late 2001, Dillinger Escape Plan met [[Greg Puciato]], one of the people who submitted a recording to the band.

The band offered him the job after two practice sessions.<ref name=voidau2008>{{cite web|access-date=October 20, 2018|url=http://voidau.com/2016/11/01/dillinger-escape-plan-on-the-early-years-mr-bungle-more/|website=Voidau.com|format=video|title=Dillinger Escape Plan on the early years, Mr. Bungle & more {{!}} Flashback interview {{!}} The Void with Christina|publication-date=November 1, 2016|date=2008|location=Sydney, Australia|first=Christina|last=Rowatt|time=1:24-1:37, 1:53-2:01}}</ref> He accepted, first appearing at the [[CMJ]] Music Festival in New York City in October.<ref name=hazard/> Soon after, Puciato and the band covered [[Damaged (Black Flag album)|"Damaged I" and "Damaged II"]] by [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] for the tribute compilation ''[[Black on Black: A Tribute to Black Flag|Black on Black]]''.<ref name=voidau2008/>

The plan to record with Patton was in place before a replacement vocalist had been found, but by the time Patton had recorded vocals and the EP was released, the band had been touring with Puciato for nearly a year. [[Epitaph Records]] offered to release the album and, although the band was doubtful at first, they finally accepted due to the label's enthusiasm.<ref name="punk-it" /> The EP titled ''[[Irony Is a Dead Scene]]'' was released on August 27, 2002.<ref>[http://www.musicemissions.com/artists/albums/index.php?album_id=1899 "The Dillinger Escape Plan – Irony is a Dead Scene", ''Review''].

=== ''Miss Machine'' (2003–2005) ===
[[File:Dillinger Escape Plan Eindhoven.png|thumb|The Dillinger Escape Plan performing in Eindhoven, 2005|alt=]]
In 2003, the band appeared on the soundtrack for ''[[Underworld (2003 film)|Underworld]]'' with the song "Baby's First Coffin", their first original song with Puciato on vocals. The band's second studio album (their first album with Puciato), ''[[Miss Machine]]'' was released on July 20, 2004, through Relapse. The album polarized The Dillinger Escape Plan audience; some fans were critical of the band's increasing artistic and musical departures from their earlier efforts, while others preferred them.<ref name=hazard/>

In the words of lead guitarist [[Ben Weinman]], the prime mover of The Dillinger Escape Plan, the band's first albums intended to "stir things up", "really try things new", and "challenge people" within the [[Hardcore punk#1990s|1990s hardcore punk scene]].<ref name="ug 2013"/> He felt that many of its bands were trying to sound like their predecessors from the previous decade rather than "encompass the[ir] attitude", which influenced him deeply,<ref name="ug 2013"/> and others were more interested in "joining into cliques" such as [[straight edge]], religious or political groups, instead of prioritizing their music.{{sfn|Farris|2011|loc=2:15:08}}

At the start of the group, Weinman considered The Dillinger Escape Plan an electronic-infused metal band as both he and Pennie were inspired by IDM music.{{sfn|R&RBG|2017|loc=11:40-12:27}}<ref name="zalu">{{cite web|url=http://zalu.be/intervieuws/huidige-maatschappij-verlamt-je-door-veelheid-aan-keuzes-interview-the-dillinger-escape-plan/|title=Huidige maatschappij verlamt je door veelheid aan keuzes (interview 'The Dillinger Escape Plan')|last=Devriendt|first=Christophe|date=2012|website=zalu.be|language=nl|archive-url=https://archive.today/20171212175729/http://zalu.be/intervieuws/huidige-maatschappij-verlamt-je-door-veelheid-aan-keuzes-interview-the-dillinger-escape-plan/|archive-date=December 12, 2017|url-status=live|access-date=January 11, 2018}}</ref> However, the members were still knowing each other and "[figuring] out what it was that we wanted to do".{{sfn|Rowatt|2017|loc=27:38}} After their debut EP, the band was joined by [[Shred guitar|guitar shredder]] John Fulton and, prior to composing the ''Under the Running Board'' EP, all the members became interested in technical [[extreme metal]] and shortly afterward [[progressive music]] and jazz fusion.<ref name="ug 2013"/><ref name=zalu/> They tried to adapt the use of [[odd time signatures]] and [[polyrhythms]] of these artists to a punk context, thus starting to compose pieces with these characteristics and repeat them until they could play it as fast as they could.{{sfn|R&RBG|2017|loc=56:49-58:48}}<ref name="scalar">{{cite web|url=http://scalar.usc.edu/works/top-13-albums-of-2013/interview-with-ben-weinman-of-the-dillinger-escape-plan|title=#10 The Dillinger Escape Plan - Interview with Ben Weinman|last=Robertson|first=Jon|date=2013|website=Scalar.usc.edu|publisher=[[University of Southern California]]|archive-url=https://archive.today/20171210102205/http://scalar.usc.edu/works/top-13-albums-of-2013/interview-with-ben-weinman-of-the-dillinger-escape-plan|archive-date=December 10, 2017|url-status=live|access-date=December 10, 2017|publication-date=July 2, 2013}}</ref> From then until their first studio album, ''Calculating Infinity'', they explored more unconventional drum patterns, such as taking notes away to expand their rhythms, or Pennie playing as hard as he could and using [[china cymbals]] excessively instead of [[splash cymbal|splashes]].{{sfn|R&RBG|2017|loc=59:29-59:29}}{{sfn|Rowatt|2017|loc=28:53}} While Pennie composed from a more academic approach, working on theory books for days, Weinman had a more intuitive approach.{{sfn|R&RBG|2017|loc=15:19-15:49}} They attribute the "tug and pull of" both personalities as a key element in The Dillinger Escape Plan development, but also as the reason for the drummer's eventual departure from it.<ref name="ug 2013"/>{{sfn|Rowatt|2017|loc=30:36}}{{sfn|R&RBG|2017|loc=14:55-15:17}}

The groundbreaking 1999 debut created a huge hype, but the band members gained an interest on melodic songwriting and production along the way, and also wanted to fully explore their electronic influences. Hence, following the departure of Dimitri Minakakis, they did this on the ''[[Irony Is a Dead Scene]]'' EP with [[Mike Patton]], which "opened the doors" for the band's experimentation.<ref name="eclat">{{cite web|url=http://www.eclat-mag.de/interviews/dillinger-escape-plan/2004-04-03.html|title=Dillinger Escape Plan|last=Karaismail|first=Kaan|website=Eclat-mag.de|location=Cologne, Germany|language=de|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511232715/http://www.eclat-mag.de/interviews/dillinger-escape-plan/2004-04-03.html|archive-date=May 11, 2018|url-status=live|access-date=May 12, 2018|date=April 3, 2004}}</ref><ref name="pennyblack2002">{{cite web|url=http://www.pennyblackmusic.co.uk/magsitepages/article/2953/Dillinger-Escape-Plan-Interview|title=Dillinger Escape Plan - Interview|last=Rowland|first=Mark|website=Pennyblackmusic.co.uk|archive-url=https://archive.today/20171225102115/http://www.pennyblackmusic.co.uk/magsitepages/article/2953/Dillinger-Escape-Plan-Interview|archive-date=December 25, 2017|url-status=live|access-date=January 12, 2018|date=October 17, 2002}}</ref>{{sfn|Mudrian|Stewart-Panko|2009|p=311-312}}

=== Songwriting ===
The songwriting process of The Dillinger Escape Plan usually started with Weinman's guitar ideas and, especially since ''Ire Works'',<ref name="ug 2013"/> [[music software|software]]' rhythms or [[sound design]] that he presented to the drummer. Until the recording sessions, the two could barely perform some of these pieces in an accurate way because of their complexity.<ref name=lambgoat2/> Both wrote and focused on approximately ten seconds of music every day, developing them through jam sessions and afterward joining several parts that "could go cohesively" together.<ref name=rymer>{{cite web|title=How Billy Rymer Helped Dillinger Escape Plan Reach Their Peak|date=November 29, 2016|first=Bob |last=Doershuk|website=[[Drummagazine.com]]|url=http://drummagazine.com/vibe-how-billy-rymer-helped-dillenger-escape-plan-reach-their-peak/|access-date=February 11, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161214040745/http://drummagazine.com/vibe-how-billy-rymer-helped-dillenger-escape-plan-reach-their-peak/|archive-date=December 14, 2016}}</ref> They send these demos to Greg Puciato and Liam Wilson: the first joined different pieces together and worked over them, making "a picture that means something to" him.<ref name="bass player2">{{cite web|access-date=December 11, 2017|url=http://www.bassplayer.com/artists/1171/liam-wilson-and-the-dillinger-escape-plan-to-release-new-album-dissociation/59633|date=September 8, 2016|title=Liam Wilson and The Dillinger Escape Plan to Release New Album ''Dissociation'' |website=[[Bass Player (magazine)|Bass Player]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20171216194634/http://www.bassplayer.com/artists/1171/liam-wilson-and-the-dillinger-escape-plan-to-release-new-album-dissociation/59633|archive-date=December 16, 2017}}</ref> Puciato stated that he could spend days to just compose a fifteen seconds part the way he wanted.<ref name=lambgoat2/> Usually, Liam Wilson was the last member to compose due to the suggestion of producer [[Steve Evetts]], who is also a bassist, in order that he could [[counterpoint]] with any instrument, including Puciato's vocals and the electronics.<ref name="bass player">{{cite web|access-date=January 24, 2018|url=http://www.bassplayer.com/artists/1171/liam-wilson-of-the-dillinger-escape-plan/26050|title=Liam Wilson of The Dillinger Escape Plan|date=March 9, 2010 |website=[[Bass Player (magazine)|Bass Player]]|first=Bryan |last=Beller|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20180124195881/http://www.bassplayer.com/artists/1171/liam-wilson-of-the-dillinger-escape-plan/26050|archive-date=January 24, 2018}}</ref>

Weinman and Puciato consider themselves to be songwriters instead of a guitarist and a vocalist, and, over time, they added diverse instruments and samples on some songs, focusing on what would fit best into them rather than their live instrumentation.<ref name="radiometal"/>

Since their inception, Steve Evetts was the producer, sound engineer and mixer of almost all The Dillinger Escape Plan's releases.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=December 15, 2017|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/steve-evetts-mn0000035335|title= Steve Evetts |website=[[AllMusic]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20171215145341/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/steve-evetts-mn0000035335|archive-date=December 15, 2017}}</ref> His close involvement in these roles led him to be considered as another member of the band.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=January 27, 2018|url=https://music.mxdwn.com/2010/04/05/features/option-craziness-an-interview-with-greg-puciato-of-dillinger-escape-plan/|title=Option Craziness: An Interview with Greg Puciato of The Dillinger Escape Plan|first=Colette |last=Claire |date=April 5, 2010|website=mxdwn.com|quote=Greg Puciato: Well, as a producer we'll definitely never use anyone except for Steve [Evetts], who produces our records now.

At the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals line-ups#2002|2002 edition]] of the prestigious [[Reading Festival]], the Dillinger Escape Plan's performance made national United Kingdom headlines because vocalist Greg Puciato defecated in full view onstage, put it into a bag, and threw it into the crowd before smearing the rest onto himself, proclaiming "This is a bag of shit, I just wanted to show you this so you'll recognize it later on throughout the day" referring to the quality of some bands he felt were appearing that day of the festival, particularly [[Puddle of Mudd]].<ref name=":0">{{cite web|last=James|first=Fox|url=http://www.strictlyrandl.com/features/the-top-100-reading-bands-of-the-2000s-no-96-dillinger-escape-plan/|title=The Top 100 Reading Bands Of The 2000s No.96: Dillinger Escape Plan|website=Strictlyrandl.com|access-date=October 16, 2013}}</ref><ref name=prindle>{{cite web|access-date=February 11, 2018|first=Mark |last=Prindle|url=http://www.markprindle.com/puciato-i.htm|title=Greg Puciato - 2003|date=September 2003|website=www.markprindle.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130707233532/http://www.markprindle.com/puciato-i.htm|archive-date=July 7, 2013}}</ref> The act nearly got the band banned from the UK for violation of public-decency laws,<ref name="rolling stone"/> despite this the band's set was one of the highest reviewed of the entire festival that year, and was later included in a list of the top one hundred Reading or Leeds performances of the decade.<ref name=":0" /> Upon returning to Reading in 2016, Puciato played the opening song "Prancer" sitting on an onstage couch reading a newspaper and drinking tea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theprp.com/2016/08/30/news/dillinger-escape-plans-2016-reading-festival-set-included-couch-table-tea/|title=The Dillinger Escape Plan's 2016 'Reading Festival' Set Included A Couch, A Table & Tea {{!}} Theprp.com – Metal And Hardcore News Plus Reviews And More|date=August 30, 2016|website=Theprp.com|access-date=October 20, 2016}}</ref>

Puciato later commented on the act saying; {{cquote|There was no way in hell that I thought that we were ever going make a living doing this or that in fourteen years I would still be having a conversation as Greg from Dillinger Escape Plan. I just thought this was a ball of fire that's gonna implode or it's got a shelf life, there's no way this can continue. So when we would get asked to play something like that in my head I was like 'well, this is never going to happen again, when am I ever going to play a festival with bands I don't like. That was kind of the other thing, that was the first time we ever played with bands we don't like [...] we had never been exposed to some like mass thing where you're playing with a band like Puddle of Mudd or whoever it was at the time who made me feel like "Oh I got to make some kind of a statement." So it was kind of a combo of kind of wanting to cause the biggest ruckus imaginable, since we're obviously never going to do this again anyway, I might as well make sure that we're never allowed to do this again anyway.<ref name="theprp shows"/>}}

Their work ethic was directly inspired by the 1990s American hardcore punk scene.{{sfn|Rowatt|2017|loc=31:30}} They also cited [[Mike Patton]] as both an artistic and business "mentor".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fasterlouder.junkee.com/the-dillinger-escape-plan-soundwave-nin-and-what-we-learnt-from-mike-patton/847955|access-date=February 1, 2018|title=The Dillinger Escape Plan: Soundwave, NIN and what we learnt from Mike Patton|first=Jody |last=Macgregor |date=July 1, 2013|publisher=[[Junkee Media]]|website=FasterLouder|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20171126023906/http://fasterlouder.junkee.com/the-dillinger-escape-plan-soundwave-nin-and-what-we-learnt-from-mike-patton/847955|archive-date=November 26, 2017}}</ref> The singer's influence on The Dillinger Escape Plan began on their 1999 tour supporting Patton's [[Mr. Bungle]], particularly by seeing how he decided to travel in a van, carry and set up his own gear, and not hire a technician, despite having "had recently been playing stadiums with [[Faith No More]]", but simultaneously he had a perfectionist standard on their live shows and did not open the venues at which they played until the sound was ideal.{{sfn|Farris|2011|loc=2:00:25}}

In 2009, Weinman founded the independent record label [[Party Smasher Inc.]] for all things related to The Dillinger Escape Plan, as well as hosting diverse independent artists and contributors.<ref name=":222"/> Weinman stated that, rather than creating a record label as such, this was intended to give them total freedom to explore all the possibilities of the music industry in the [[Information Age]] instead of being restricted by a traditional record deal.<ref name=ghostcultmag/> They released their last three albums on the label.<ref name=forbes/>

Although never having had an agenda on their lyrics, the band members were outspoken and usually controversial in interviews.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=January 22, 2018|url=https://www.revolvermag.com/music/dillinger-escape-plan-exit-interview|title=Dillinger Escape Plan: The Exit Interview|date=December 17, 2017|publication-date=December 18, 2017|first= Lars |last=Ulrich|magazine=[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20171226224406/https://www.revolvermag.com/music/dillinger-escape-plan-exit-interview|archive-date=December 26, 2017}}</ref> In 2016, Puciato said: "We give a lot of fucks about not giving a fuck, if that makes sense.

Full stop."<ref name="metalsucks 2016"/> ''[[Drowned in Sound]]'''s Ben Patashnik declared in 2007 that Dillinger is one of the few bands to have "emerged from small, insular, resolutely non-mainstream scenes" and at the same time "managed to reach well further than one might reasonably think possible."<ref name="carry the torch"/>

The Dillinger Escape Plan were honored at the 2017 [[Association of Independent Music]] Awards. The band received the "Outstanding Contribution to Music" prize at the ceremony at The Brewery, Clerkenwell. The AIM Awards judge and ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' editor Merlin Alderslade said: <blockquote>"The Dillinger Escape Plan aren't only one of the most influential heavy bands of the last 20 years, but one of the single most important forces to ever grace our scene. From their genre-shredding albums that have gone on to inspire legions of bands to their now legendary live shows, they have trail-blazed their way through an incredible career that has united alternative music fans from all walks of life. The AIM awards are about recognising music crafted in the true spirit of independence and I couldn't think of a more fitting band to walk on stage to accept this award than Dillinger."<ref name=":2" /></blockquote>
