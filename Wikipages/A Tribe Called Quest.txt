During this period, group members contributed to several notable outside projects with production and guest verses.

=== 1999–2005: Solo projects and brief return to recording ===
Under the management of [[Violator (company)|Violator]], Q-Tip launched a successful solo career, which saw two [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] hits, "[[Vivrant Thing]]" and "[[Breathe and Stop]]", and the release of the gold-certified album ''[[Amplified (Q-Tip album)|Amplified]]'' in late 1999.<ref name="biography"/> The album featured production by Q-Tip, Jay Dee and [[DJ Scratch]]. Despite receiving mostly positive reviews, the album was criticized by the hip hop community for its mainstream sound.<ref name="redbull"/> The most notable of Q-Tip's critics was Phife Dawg, who took his former partner to task on his solo album ''[[Ventilation: Da LP]]'', released in 2000.<ref name="biography"/> The [[Hi-Tek]]-produced lead single, "[[Flawless (Phife Dawg song)|Flawless]]", contained the lines "Go 'head, play yourself with them ho-like hooks / sing ballads if it's all about the [[Maxwell (musician)|Maxwell]] look".<ref name="biography"/> ''Ventilation'' included production by Jay Dee and [[Pete Rock]].

Teaming up with two other artists from former groups, [[Raphael Saadiq]] of [[Tony! Toni! Toné!]] and [[Dawn Robinson]] of [[En Vogue]], Muhammad's next project was [[Lucy Pearl]].<ref name="biography"/> The group scored two hit singles with "[[Dance Tonight (Lucy Pearl song)|Dance Tonight]]" and "[[Don't Mess with My Man (Lucy Pearl song)|Don't Mess with My Man]]", from their [[Lucy Pearl (album)|self-titled album]], which was certified gold a few months after its release in 2000. Following a dispute between Saadiq and Robinson, the latter left the group and was replaced by [[Joi (singer)|Joi]]; however, this new incarnation would only last for the remainder of touring.<ref name="biography"/>

In 2001, Q-Tip changed directions and recorded ''[[Kamaal the Abstract]]'', an album which saw him in the role of singer and bandleader.<ref name="redbull"/> Unlike his work with A Tribe Called Quest, or his previous solo work, ''Kamaal'' was constructed around live music and abstract song concepts. [[Arista Records]] refused to release the album, doubting its commercial potential, resulting in Q-Tip leaving the label.<ref name="kamaal">[https://ew.com/article/2007/09/04/q-tip-finally-getting-his-second-album-out/ Q-Tip on finally getting his second album out] ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. Accessed on April 20, 2017.</ref> The following year, he recorded the song "What Lies Beneath" for the ''[[Soundbombing III]]'' compilation, in which he responded to Phife Dawg's comments on "Flawless".

In 2003, Q-Tip and Phife Dawg put aside their differences and A Tribe Called Quest briefly returned to the studio, recording the song "I C U (Doin' It)", featuring [[Erykah Badu]].<ref name="biography"/> It was intended to be the first single from the Violator compilation, ''V3: The Good, The Bad & The Ugly'', however, the album was not released.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2016/08/rare-song-a-tribe-called-quest-erykah-badu-audio/ |title=With A New Album Coming, Revisit A Tribe Called Quest's Rare Erykah Badu Collabo (Audio) |magazine=Ambrosia for Heads |access-date=March 1, 2020}}</ref> Undeterred by the shelving of ''Kamaal the Abstract'', Q-Tip recorded ''Open'' in late 2003, planning to release it the next year.<ref name="kamaal"/><ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/1479824/a-tribe-called-quest-are-back-but-q-tip-keeps-doing-his-own-thing/ A TRIBE CALLED QUEST ARE BACK, BUT Q-TIP KEEPS DOING HIS OWN THING] [[MTV]].

On August 27, 2004, A Tribe Called Quest headlined the [[Street Scene (San Diego music festival)|Street Scene]] music festival in [[San Diego]].<ref name="biography"/> Muhammad focused on developing a stable of artists, most of whom were showcased on his debut solo album, ''[[Shaheedullah and Stereotypes]]'', released later that year. In 2005, the group received the Founders Award at the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' R&B/Hip-Hop Awards in Atlanta.<ref name="billboardawards"/>

=== 2006–2013: Reunion and touring ===
In 2006, the group reunited as a touring band, in part, to help Phife Dawg with his mounting medical expenses.<ref name="beats"/> They co-headlined that year's [[Bumbershoot]] festival in Seattle and performed several sold-out concerts in the U.S., Canada and Japan. The group also appeared on the 2K Sports Bounce Tour, promoting the ''[[NBA 2K7]]'' video game, with a [[Dan the Automator]] remix of their song "Lyrics to Go" appearing on [[Dan the Automator Presents 2K7|the game's soundtrack]].<ref name="biography"/> According to Phife Dawg at the time, A Tribe Called Quest planned to release an album, as they owed Jive one more in their six-album contract.<ref name="beats"/> Speaking about the possibility of a new album showing up that year, Phife Dawg said:

{{quote|Man, we was only 18–19 when we first got started. [When] we broke up we were still like 28. Now we are 35–36. It'd be real different being in the studio. It would be real interesting to see where Q-Tip is. It would all be on a much higher level. But we are all into such different stuff from way back then. We'd need at least a solid month to work on something. Trying to get all of us together for that much time … I don't see that happening.<ref name="autogenerated2"/>}}
