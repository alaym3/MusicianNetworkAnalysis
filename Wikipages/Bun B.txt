==Life and career==
Freeman was born in [[Houston]], [[Texas]] & was raised in the city of [[Port Arthur, Texas]], where he met [[Pimp C]].

===UGK===
{{Main|UGK}}
In the late 1980s, [[Pimp C]] started the rap duo [[UGK]]. He first released a demo tape titled "Underground King" which didn't feature Bun B on the track. Instead, it featured Pimp C's friend Mitchell Queen. Bun B and friend Jalon Jackson had their own group called P.A. Militia. Both groups joined forces and formed the group 4 Black Ministers. Queen and Jackson later left the group leaving Pimp C and Bun B so they decided to revert to UGK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2011/03/greatest-hip-hop-demos/ugk|title=The 30 Greatest Hip Hop demos|access-date=2012-12-28}}</ref> The demo Pimp C recorded with Mitchell Queen, ''Underground King'', caught the attention of an independent label in [[Houston]] called Bigtyme Records. They then released an [[extended play]] titled ''[[The Southern Way]]''. The release of this record caught the attention of [[Jive Records]]. While recording their debut album, ''[[Too Hard to Swallow]]'', many of the songs had content too explicit for the album, so Bigtyme Records released an extended play titled ''[[Banned (EP)|Banned]]'' before the album was released, including all the songs that were too explicit for ''Too Hard to Swallow''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.straightgangsterism.com/2008/11/30/songs-no-one-should-here-ugks-banned/|title=Songs No One Should Hear: UGK's Banned|access-date=2012-11-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216021413/http://www.straightgangsterism.com/2008/11/30/songs-no-one-should-here-ugks-banned/|archive-date=2008-12-16|url-status=dead}}</ref> The song "Pocket Full of Stones" became the first UGK song to get major airplay throughout the United States. Their second album, ''[[Super Tight]]...'', followed in 1994. Their third album, ''[[Ridin' Dirty]]'', peaked at number 2 on the R&B Charts in 1996, and at number 15 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. After releasing their fourth studio album, ''[[Dirty Money (album)|Dirty Money]]'', Pimp C got sentenced to jail.<ref name="allmusic2012">{{cite web|last=Bush|first=John|title=UGK > Biography|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p413944|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|date=2008-05-20|access-date=2012-04-13}}</ref>
