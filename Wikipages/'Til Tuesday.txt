==History==
'Til Tuesday first gained fame six months after its formation when it won Boston's [[WBCN Rock & Roll Rumble]] in 1983. Their original composition "[[Love in a Vacuum]]" (credited to all members of the group) received a fair amount of airplay on the station, and the group was eventually signed to [[Epic Records]].<ref>{{cite book|title='til tuesday – Voices Carry (Epic)|first=E. |last=Brooks |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ugCQfxwym0C&q=spin+magazine+1985+til+tuesday&pg=PA29 |work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |access-date=2010-08-21 |date=May 1985}}</ref>

"Love in a Vacuum" was re-recorded for the Epic debut album, 1985's ''[[Voices Carry (album)|Voices Carry]]''; however, the breakthrough song turned out to be the title track.<ref name="Larkin"/> The "Voices Carry" single peaked at number eight on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]],<ref name="Hot 100" /> and is said to have been inspired by an argument between Mann and Hausman, who had broken off a relationship before the album's release.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} According to producer [[Mike Thorne]] on his Stereo Society web site, "The title track was originally written and sung by Aimee as if to a woman.... The record company was predictably unhappy with such lyrics."<ref>{{cite web|title=The making of Til Tuesday's Voices Carry |first=Mike |last=Thorne |url=http://www.stereosociety.com/voicescarry.html |work=StereoSociety.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908113009/http://www.stereosociety.com/voicescarry.html |archive-date=2008-09-08 |url-status=dead |access-date=2009-06-17 |date=March 1999 }}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine would later report that Epic Records labelmate [[Cyndi Lauper]] was interested in recording "Voices Carry" with the original lyric, but only if the band did not put it on their own release.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The band became an early [[MTV]] staple with the "[[Voices Carry (song)|Voices Carry]]" video, which depicts an oppressive boyfriend trying to convert Mann to his upper-class lifestyle; she finally lashes out at him during a concert at [[Carnegie Hall]], though filmed at the Strand Theatre in [[Dorchester, Massachusetts|Dorchester]], Massachusetts, standing up from her seat in the audience and belting the lyrics, "He said, shut up! He said, shut up! Oh God, can't you keep it down...?" as she removes her cap to reveal her signature spiky, rat-tailed hair. As a result, the group won that year's [[MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

By the 1986 follow-up ''[[Welcome Home ('Til Tuesday album)|Welcome Home]]'', Mann was beginning to write more of the songs herself and the band was moving away from the slick new wave sound of their debut.<ref name="Larkin"/> But while critical reaction was generally strong, the #26 placing for the lead single, "[[What About Love ('Til Tuesday song)|What About Love]]", was a commercial disappointment, especially after the top-ten success of "Voices Carry". Even more problematic, the album just barely sneaked into the U.S. top 50,<ref name="Billboard 200" /> also a letdown after the #19 placing for their debut.<ref name="Billboard 200" />

After the album's release Pesce left the band and was replaced by [[Michael Montes]].  At about the same time, Mann's two-year relationship with singer-songwriter [[Jules Shear]],<ref name="Larkin"/> whom she had been dating since the release of the ''Voices Carry'' album, came to an end.<ref>{{cite news |title='Til Tuesday: Art From a Broken Heart |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-11-20/entertainment/ca-221_1_broken-heart |first=Chris |last=Willman |date=November 20, 1988 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=2011-12-31}}</ref> This breakup somewhat informed the band's final album, 1988's ''[[Everything's Different Now]]'',<ref name="Larkin"/> particularly in the song "J for Jules", though Mann insisted that not every song on the LP was about the relationship. Shear collaborated with [[Matthew Sweet]] on the album's title track; it also featured "[[The Other End (Of the Telescope)]]", a collaboration between Mann and [[Elvis Costello]] on which Costello provides a guest vocal.<ref name="Larkin"/>

While critical praise continued to flow, ''Everything's Different Now'' was not a commercial success. The album peaked at No.&nbsp;124 in the U.S.<ref name="Billboard 200" />, while the lead single "[[(Believed You Were) Lucky]]" (co-written with Shear) reached number 95.<ref name="Hot 100" /> 
  
'Til Tuesday essentially broke up after the release of ''Everything's Different Now''.<ref name="Larkin"/> However, for a short time Mann continued to tour under the 'Til Tuesday name with various session players (including guitarists [[Jon Brion]] and Clayton Scoble) while legal problems with the band's label [[Epic Records|Epic]] prevented her from beginning work on a solo record for several years. (Mann's solo career officially began in 1992).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Hausman, meanwhile, became Mann's manager, a position he holds to this day.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}
