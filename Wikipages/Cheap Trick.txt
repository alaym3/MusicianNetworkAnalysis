==History==
===Origins and early years (1969–1977)===
In 1967, [[Rick Nielsen]] formed [[Fuse (band)|Fuse]] with Tom Peterson (later known as [[Tom Petersson]]), who had played in another [[Rockford, Illinois]] band called The Bo Weevils.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{Cite book|first=Martin C. |last=Strong |year=2000 |title=The Great Rock Discography |edition=5th |publisher=Mojo Books |location=Edinburgh |pages=170–71 |isbn=1-84195-017-3}}</ref> With Bun E.

[[Randy Hogan|Randy "Xeno" Hogan]] was the original lead singer for Cheap Trick.

[[File:CheapTrick1977.jpg|thumb|right|Nielsen and Petersson performing in 1977]]
With Robin Zander now on vocals, the band recorded a demo in 1975 and played in warehouses, bowling alleys, and various other venues around the [[midwestern United States]]. The band was signed to [[Epic Records]] in early 1976.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} The band released its first album, ''[[Cheap Trick (1977 album)|Cheap Trick]]'', in early 1977.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> While favored by critics, the album did not sell well.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> The album's lone single, "[[Oh, Candy]]", failed to chart, as did the album. Their second album, ''[[In Color (album)|In Color]]'', was released later that year.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The singles "I Want You To Want Me" and "Southern Girls" failed to chart.

===Budokan brings success (1978–1980)===
When Cheap Trick toured in Japan for the first time in April 1978, they were received with a frenzy reminiscent of [[Beatlemania]].<ref name="rsbio">{{cite magazine |title=Cheap Trick Biography |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/cheap-trick/biography|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505003139/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/cheap-trick/biography|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 5, 2013|access-date=2017-07-12}}</ref> During the tour, Cheap Trick recorded two concerts at the [[Nippon Budokan]]. Ten tracks taken from both shows were compiled and released as a live album entitled ''[[Cheap Trick at Budokan]]'',<ref name="LarkinHR"/> which was intended to be exclusive to Japan.<ref name="rsdp">{{cite magazine|last=Marsh|first=Dave|title=Cheap Trick: Dream Police|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |issue=305 |date=November 29, 1979 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/dream-police-19791129|access-date=2017-07-12}}</ref>

The band's third studio album, ''[[Heaven Tonight]]'' was released in May 1978.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The lead-off track "[[Surrender (Cheap Trick song)|Surrender]]" was Cheap Trick's first single to chart in the United States, peaking at No.&nbsp;62. It has gone on to become one of the band's signature songs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Demand for ''Cheap Trick at Budokan'' became so great that Epic Records finally released the album in the U.S. in February 1979.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} ''Cheap Trick at Budokan'' launched the band into international stardom, and the album went [[triple platinum]] in the United States.<ref name="rsbio"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Cheap Trick – At Budokan (album) |publisher=SwissCharts.com |url=http://swisscharts.com/showitem.asp?key=40527&cat=a |access-date=2007-11-10}}</ref> The first single from the album was the live version of "I Want You to Want Me", which had originally been released on ''In Color''. It reached No.&nbsp;7 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and became Cheap Trick's best-selling single to date.<ref name="billboard.com">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/cheap-trick|title=Cheap Trick|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> The second single, "[[Ain't That A Shame]]", peaked at No.&nbsp;35. "[[Need Your Love (Cheap Trick song)|Need Your Love]]" had already been recorded for the forthcoming ''[[Dream Police]]'' album that had already been finished, but after the unprecedented success of ''Cheap Trick at Budokan'', Epic postponed the album's release.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

''Dream Police'' was released later in 1979,<ref name="LarkinHR"/> and was their third album in a row produced by Tom Werman. The [[Dream Police (song)|title track]] of the album was a hit single, as was "[[Voices (Cheap Trick song)|Voices]]". ''Dream Police'' also found the band taking its style in a more experimental direction by incorporating strings and dabbling in [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] on tracks like "Gonna Raise Hell". By 1980, Cheap Trick was headlining arenas.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

On August 26, 1980, Petersson left the group to record a solo album with his wife Dagmar,<ref name="LarkinHR"/> using the band name Another Language. [[Jon Brant]] became Petersson's steady replacement, after a year of Cheap Trick touring and recording with Peter Comita.<ref name="LarkinHR"/>

''[[All Shook Up (Cheap Trick album)|All Shook Up]]'' (1980), produced by former Beatles producer [[George Martin]],<ref name="LarkinHR"/> reached No.&nbsp;24 on the charts and was certified gold. However, the album's high-class background did not save it from descriptions like "[[Led Zeppelin]] gone psycho".<ref name="fricke">{{cite magazine |last=Fricke |first=David |title=Cheap Trick: All Shook Up  |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |issue=339 |date=March 19, 1981 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/all-shook-up-19810319 |access-date=2017-07-12}}</ref>

===1980s struggles (1981–1986)===
In July 1981, CBS Inc. sued Cheap Trick and their manager Ken Adamany for $10 million, alleging they were attempting to coerce CBS into re-negotiating their contract and had refused to record any new material for the label since October 1980.  The lawsuit was settled in early 1982 and work commenced on the next album: ''[[One on One (Cheap Trick album)|One on One]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} The album spawned two minor hits with the power ballad "[[If You Want My Love]]" (which peaked at no. 45) and the innuendo-laced rocker "[[She's Tight]]" (which peaked at no. 65).<ref name="auto5">{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/cheap-trick|title=Cheap Trick Chart History|magazine=Billboard}}</ref>

Cheap Trick released ''[[Next Position Please]]'' in 1983.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The album's two singles, "[[Dancing the Night Away#Cheap Trick version|Dancing the Night Away]]" and "[[I Can't Take It]]," failed to chart.<ref name="auto5"/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://tampabay.com/a-slowdown-in-hits-from-cheap-trick-i-cant-take-it/2306497/|title=A slowdown in hits from Cheap Trick?

In 1984, the band recorded the [[Up the Creek (song)|title track]] to the [[Tim Matheson]] comedy ''[[Up the Creek (1984 film)|Up The Creek]]'', which Nielsen later called "one of the worst" songs he'd ever written.<ref>{{cite news|last=Krewson |first=John |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/cheap-trick-13461 |title=Cheap Trick |newspaper=The A.V.

The band released ''[[Standing on the Edge (Cheap Trick album)|Standing on the Edge]]'' in 1985.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> This album was called their "best collection of bubblegum bazooka rock in years".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Fricke |first=David |title=Cheap Trick: Standing on the Edge |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |issue=458 |date=October 10, 1985 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/standing-on-the-edge-19851010 |access-date=2017-07-12}}</ref> The album's first single, "[[Tonight It's You]]", reached No.&nbsp;8 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Top Rock Tracks]] chart.<ref name="auto5" />

In 1986, the band recorded "[[Mighty Wings]]", the end-title cut for the film ''[[Top Gun]]''.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> They then released ''[[The Doctor (Cheap Trick album)|The Doctor]]'' in the fall.

===Popular resurgence (1987–1989)===
Petersson rejoined the group in 1987<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/lake-county-news-sun/lifestyles/ct-lns-cheap-trick-st-0303-20170223-story.html|title=Cheap Trick's bass player talks music, luck, family|first=Sheryl|last=DeVore|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}</ref>  and helped record 1988's ''[[Lap of Luxury]]'',<ref name="LarkinHR"/> produced by [[Richie Zito]]. Due to the band's commercial decline, Epic Records insisted that the band collaborate with professional songwriters on the album.<ref name="auto" /> Nielsen said, "''Lap of Luxury'' was a tough record to make. We could lie to you and tell you it was all wonderful and great. It wasn't. It was tough working with other writers. But it was a lesson for us."<ref>''Billboard'', "Talent: Cheap Trick offers new audio treat," Ed Christman, October 6, 1990, page 32</ref>

"[[The Flame (Cheap Trick song)|The Flame]]", a ballad, was issued as the first single from the album,<ref name="LarkinHR"/> and became the band's first-ever No.&nbsp;1 hit.<ref name="billboard.com" /> The second single, a cover of [[Elvis Presley]]'s "[[Don't Be Cruel]]", peaked at no. 4.

===Transitions (1990–2015)===
''[[Busted (Cheap Trick album)|Busted]]'' was released in 1990.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The band was allowed more creative control, and professional songwriters were only used on a handful of songs. The first single, "Can't Stop Falling Into Love", reached {{Numero|12}} on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100,<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/cheap-trick/chart-history/hsi/ |title=Cheap Trick Chart History - Hot 100 |magazine=Billboard |access-date=August 9, 2019}}</ref> and {{Numero|4}} on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Album Rock Tracks chart]].<ref name="billboard1" /> The second single, the [[Diane Warren]]-penned "[[Wherever Would I Be]]", reached {{Numero|50}} on the charts.<ref>{{cite magazine  |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/cheap-trick/chart-history/hsi/ |title=Cheap Trick Wherever Would I Be Chart History |magazine=Billboard |access-date=August 9, 2019}}</ref> The single "If You Need Me" was not successful, although the track "Back 'n Blue" reached {{Numero|32}} on the U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Album Rock Tracks chart]].<ref name="billboard1">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/cheap-trick/chart-history/rtt/ |title=Cheap Trick Chart History - Mainstream Rock Songs |magazine=Billboard |access-date=August 9, 2019}}</ref>

In 1991, Cheap Trick's ''[[The Greatest Hits (Cheap Trick album)|Greatest Hits]]'' was released.<ref name="LarkinHR"/>

The group left Epic after the disappointing sales of ''Busted''  to sign with [[Warner Bros. Records]].<ref name="LarkinHR"/> In 1994, the band released ''[[Woke Up With A Monster]]''.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The album's title track was issued as the first single and reached No.&nbsp;16 on the US Mainstream Rock charts. The album's sales were poor, and it peaked at only No.&nbsp;123.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

In 1997, Cheap Trick signed with indie label Red Ant Records and released ''[[Cheap Trick (1997 album)|Cheap Trick]]''.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The band attempted to re-introduce themselves to a new generation, as the album was self-titled and the artwork was similar to their first album which had been released twenty years before.<ref name="prodcrs">{{cite web |title=Tom Werman blog |publisher=Popdose.com |url=http://popdose.com/the-producers-oysters-cheap-tricks-and-jake-elwood-blues/#more-20497 |access-date=2010-03-05}}</ref> The album was critically acclaimed and hailed as a return to form.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> Eleven weeks after the release, Red Ant's parent company Alliance Entertainment Corporation declared [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]]. The single "[[Say Goodbye (Cheap Trick song)|Say Goodbye]]" only reached No.&nbsp;119 on the charts, and the band again found themselves without a record label. Two other singles were released from the album, "Baby No More" and "[[Carnival Game (song)|Carnival Game]]".{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Cheap Trick began to rebuild in 1998. The band toured behind the release of ''Cheap Trick at Budokan: The Complete Concert'',<ref name="LarkinHR"/> and the [[remastered]] re-issues of the band's first three albums. One of the multi-night stands from this tour resulted in ''[[Music for Hangovers]]'', a live album that featured members of [[the Smashing Pumpkins]] on two tracks. In 1999, the band recorded a cover of [[Big Star|Big Star's]] 1972 song "[[In the Street (song)|In The Street]]" that was used as the theme song for the hit sitcom ''[[That '70s Show]]''. Cheap Trick ended the song with the lyric "We're all all right," which was drawn from their own 1978 song "[[Surrender (Cheap Trick song)|Surrender]]".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/readers-poll-the-best-television-theme-songs-23185/7-that-70s-show-in-the-street-32090/|title=Readers Poll: The Best Television Theme Songs|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=September 21, 2011|access-date=September 26, 2018}}</ref>

On July 17, 2011, at the Bluesfest in Ottawa, a thunderstorm blew through the festival area 20 minutes into the band's set.

Carlos filed a lawsuit against his former bandmates in 2013.
