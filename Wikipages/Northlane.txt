Their six-track debut extended play, ''Hollow Existence'', was released in January 2010:<ref name="Barton"/> it was generally well received.

On 28 August 2020, the band released their second live album titled ''Live at the Roundhouse'', a 14-track release that is out on streaming platforms and sees the band performing the first and biggest leg of the national tour, drawing generously from the ''Alien'' tracklist. It captures their hometown show at the Roundhouse last October while touring their most recent album, ''Alien''. Earlier that month, the band broadcast the concert footage in full as part of a pay-per-view livestream event, giving fans a chance to witness the intense, sold-out show from the comfort of their own homes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/music/northlane-share-new-live-album-live-at-the-roundhouse-2739727|title=Northlane share new live album 'Live At the Roundhouse'|date=28 August 2020|website=NME|access-date=7 October 2020}}</ref>

On 15 February 2021, ''Live at the Roundhouse'' was made available to stream on YouTube, due to the show being pirated on the internet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metalinjection.net/video/northlane-streams-entire-live-at-the-roundhouse-show|title=NORTHLANE Streams Entire Live at the Roundhouse Show|date=16 February 2021|website=Metal Injection|access-date=21 February 2021}}</ref> On 21 February, the band announced a five-track remix EP, entitled ''5G''. The EP, set for release on 26 February 2021, features remixes of tracks primarily lifted from their 2019 album ''Alien''. The sole exception to this is a remix of "Ohm", which comes from the band's 2015 album ''Node''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/music/northlane-announce-surprise-remix-ep-5g-for-this-friday-2885199|title=Northlane announce surprise remix EP '5G' for this Friday|date=21 February 2021|website=NME|access-date=25 February 2021}}</ref>

===Padjasek's departure, ''2D'' EP and ''Obsidian'' (2021–present)===
On 18 March, the band released a brand new single "Clockwork" along with an accompanying music video. The single has been chosen as the official theme song for the video game ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege]]'' at this year's Oceanic Nationals eSports League.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deadpress.co.uk/news-northlane-release-new-single-clockwork/|title=NEWS: Northlane release new single, 'Clockwork'!|date=18 March 2021|website=Dead Press!|access-date=18 March 2021}}</ref> On the same day, they also announced that bassist Brendon Padjasek departed from the band in order to focus on his home life, with the group intending to continue on as a quartet for the time being, with Jon Deiley handling bass duties since.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theprp.com/2021/03/18/news/northlane-part-ways-with-bassist-brendon-padjasek/|title=Northlane Part Ways With Bassist Brendon Padjasek|date=18 March 2021|website=ThePRP|access-date=19 March 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=3 November 2021|title=Jonathon Deiley's post|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/CVy6NbQBECs/?|url-status=live|website=Instagram}}</ref> On 19 April, the band confirmed that they had begun recording their sixth album.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.deadpress.co.uk/news-northlane-begin-recording-sixth-album/|title=NEWS: Northlane begin recording sixth album!|work=Dead Press!|date=20 April 2021|access-date=21 April 2021}}</ref>

On 10 May, the band announced another five-track EP, entitled ''2D''. The EP, set for release on 21 May 2021, features acoustic versions of tracks primarily lifted from their 2019 album ''Alien''. Vocalist Marcus Bridge explains how ''2D'' adds another dimension to these tracks: "Recording an acoustic EP is something that we've wanted to do for quite some time and felt right with the personal nature of the songs from ''Alien''. I wanted to strip these songs back to the bare minimum to juxtapose the soundscapes of the album, a 2D version of sorts. A song like 'Rift' has a completely different energy in this context and took on new meaning with the recording in the depths of lockdown, now almost feeling like a cry of frustration and despair."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/northlane-announces-acoustic-ep-2d/|title=NORTHLANE Announces Acoustic EP '2D'|date=10 May 2021|website=Blabbermouth.net|access-date=11 May 2021}}</ref>
