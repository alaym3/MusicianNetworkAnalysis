'''Combichrist''' is an American [[Electro-industrial|aggrotech]] / [[industrial metal]] band formed in 2003 by Norwegian vocalist [[Andy LaPlegua]], who also founded the bands [[Icon of Coil]], [[Panzer AG]], Scandinavian Cock and Scandy. Combichrist was formed in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]] and is now based in [[Oak Hill, Florida]]. The band consists of only LaPlegua in the studio, with a changing lineup of live performing members. Releases by the band have been very successful in terms of sales and charted in top positions for dance and alternative charts worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|title = Combichrist – Biography {{!}} Billboard|url = http://www.billboard.com/artist/299555/combichrist/biography|website = Billboard.com|access-date = July 14, 2015}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation and early years===
The first material that LaPlegua wrote for the project was a [[power noise]]/[[techno]] crossover track ''Thanx to my Buddies'' under the moniker ''D.r.i.v.E'' for the Advanced Electronics Vol. 2 compilation.<ref>{{cite web|title=D.r.i.v.E song|url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-Advanced-Electronics-Vol-2/release/382552|website=Discogs.com|access-date=January 26, 2012}}</ref> The song was later remade into ''Like to Thank My Buddies'' on Combichrist's album ''[[Everybody Hates You]]''. The project's name was later changed to ''Hudlager'' and then finally to Combichrist before the debut album ''[[The Joy of Gunz]]'' was released on the German record label [[Out of Line]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Name Change|url=http://vampirefreaks.com/content/comment.php?entry=293&t=Interview+with+Combichrist|website=Vampirefreaks.com|access-date=December 30, 2011}}</ref>
The band name came from a [[fanzine]] of LaPlegua's in the 1990s, with Combichrist being a character in it that was a "punk-rock messiah". The character would go on drug and alcohol fueled rampages, later healing those whom he had beaten.<ref>{{cite web|title=Origin of the Combichrist Name|url=http://www.twistmagazine.se/inter/combichristen|website=Twistmagazine.se|access-date=November 25, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814090111/http://www.twistmagazine.se/inter/combichristen|archive-date=August 14, 2011}}</ref> A few years after the band's conception, LaPlegua departed Norway for the United States, which is now the current home-base for Combichrist and his other projects Scandy, Panzer AG, and Scandinavian Cock.<ref>{{cite web|title=Confirmation of location|url=http://clatl.com/cribnotes/archives/2010/11/23/atlantas-combichrist-brings-feast-of-industrial-chaos-to-masquerade|website=Clatl.com|access-date=November 25, 2011}}</ref>

===''The Joy of Gunz'' (2003–2005)===
Combichrist's first LP ''The Joy of Gunz'' was released in 2003. Sporting a fresh, original and aggressive new sound the brainchild of LaPlegua took the crowds by storm.<ref>{{cite web|title = out of line music / artists / combichrist|url = http://www.outofline.de/combichrist/index.html|website = Outofline.de|access-date = July 8, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170313064522/http://www.outofline.de/combichrist/index.html|archive-date = March 13, 2017|url-status = dead}}</ref> On Halloween of the same year, the limited edition EP ''[[Kiss The Blade]]'' was released with 667 pressings which sold out in less than a week.<ref name="metropolis-records.com">{{cite web|title=Combichrist band history from Metropolis Records|url=http://metropolis-records.com/artist/combichrist|website=Metropolis-records.com|access-date=November 25, 2011}}</ref> In 2004, the second EP, ''[[Sex, Drogen Und Industrial]]'', spent several weeks at number one in the DAC charts. At the same time that ''Sex, Drogen Und Industrial'' was released, a limited edition of 666 white-vinyl 12" pressings for ''[[Blut Royale]]'' were produced, and sold out quickly.<ref name="metropolis-records.com" />

=== ''Everybody Hates You'' (2005–2006) ===
The year 2005 saw the release of ''[[Everybody Hates You]]'' and it was at this time that LaPlegua began labeling the music as "Techno Body Music" or TBM.<ref>{{cite web|title=Andy talks Combichrist and the changing soundscape|url=http://www.electrowelt.com/index.php?Itemid=72&catid=1&id=653:exclusive-interview-with-andy-laplegua-combichristpanzer-ag-icon-of-coil-scandy&option=com_content&view=article|website=Electrowelt.com|access-date=November 25, 2011}}</ref> The band released a song called "This is TBM" on the Out-of-Line compilation ''Techno Body Music volume 1''.<ref>{{cite web|title=TBM Compilation|url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-This-Is-Techno-Body-Music-Vol-1/release/533127|website=Discogs.com|access-date=November 25, 2011}}</ref> They played this song live during their 2005 shows, adding vocals to it. No vocal version of the instrumental track was ever released, and the lyrics were instead later reworked for the track "Electrohead". After this release, LaPlegua stopped referring to their music as TBM. Shortly after the release of the album, Army On The Dance Floor producer [[Kourtney Klein]] was added as alternating keyboardist and drummer to the band.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nitzer-ebb.de/ebbdotcom/interview_2006_kourtneyklein.html | title=Zero Music interviews Kourtney Klein | publisher=Zero Music Magazine | access-date=April 29, 2012 | year=2006}}</ref> The full-length album featured two tracks that became club classics "This Shit Will Fuck You Up" and "This Is My Rifle"and it was also the project's U.S. debut on Metropolis Records. Further benchmarks were set with the release of the 2006 EP "[[Get Your Body Beat]]" the title track of which landed Combichrist its first appearance on ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Top 10 Dance Singles chart.<ref>{{cite web|title = Combichrist – Biography|url = http://www.combichrist.com/biography/|website =Combichrist.com|access-date = July 14, 2015|first = DigitalCavalry|last = Combichrist}}</ref> The music video for the single was included on the DVD release of the [[biopunk]] film ''[[The Gene Generation]]'' with the song also being used in the movie.<ref>{{cite web|title=Combichrist and VNV nation work on Gene Generation|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=14814_0_2_0_C|website=Side-line.com|access-date=January 22, 2012}}</ref> The band embarked on a North American tour with [[KMFDM]] soon after the release of the single.<ref name="metropolis-records.com" />

===''Making Monsters'' (2010–2014) ===
[[Image:Andy LaPlegua in February 2010.jpg|thumb|250px| LaPlegua performing in 2010]]

Combichrist's album, ''[[Making Monsters (album)|Making Monsters]]'', was released digitally on August 31, 2010 and on CD on September 28, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Combichrist Album|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/b19738_combichrist_making_monsters_this_fall.html|website=Fearnet.com|access-date=November 25, 2011}}</ref> Combichrist began a tour in support of the new album in late 2010, with [[Aesthetic Perfection]] and [[iVardensphere]] as the support bands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/music/959 |title='Wolverine & Jubilee' Are 'Cursed' This January |publisher=Bloody Disgusting! |date=October 21, 2010 |access-date=May 23, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regenmag.com/News-5102-Combichrist.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902063612/http://www.regenmag.com/News-5102-Combichrist.html |archive-date=September 2, 2010 }}</ref> In 2011, after opening for [[Rammstein]] at Madison Square Garden in December 2010, both bands announced Combichrist would be supporting Rammstein on their North American tour and LaPlegua announced the "Monsters on Tour Part II" taking place around the scheduled Rammstein shows.

=== ''This Is Where Death Begins'' (2016) ===
This Is Where Death Begins is the eighth studio album. It was released on June 3, 2016. The album sees the band moving further away from their original electronic sound towards rock and metal.

==='' Make Europe Great Again (M.E.G.A) Tour'' and ''This Is Where Death Begins'' (2016) ===
In February 2016, it was announced that the new album (as yet untitled, but often hashtagged #ThisIsWhereITBegins on Instagram posts about it) will be released in May. LaPlegua and the band's official Instagram pages posted snippets, clips, and hinted at guest artists – possibly some of [[Coal Chamber]] and [[Filter (band)|Filter]], and the female singer of MXMS. A full European tour is planned for June and July, with Nick Rossi (ex-[[New Years Day (band)|New Years Day]]) joining the live line-up as a second drummer/percussionist. Meanwhile, the band's first show of the year – the Out Of Line Festival in Berlin – saw them perform without long-time keyboardist Z. Marr, who has left the band to pursue other interests (in June 2016 it was revealed he has joined [[Pig (musical project)|<nowiki><PIG></nowiki>]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/accounts/login/|title=Login • Instagram|website=Instagram.com|access-date=November 17, 2020}}</ref>) He was replaced by Elliott Berlin, of [[Aesthetic Perfection]] and Telemark, who has previously played keys for an "Old-School" Combichrist show and toured extensively as their show tech. Nick Rossi will be playing live keys on the forthcoming tour, in addition to his drumming duties – much as Shaun Frandsen did on the 2012 Evolution Tour.

On April 9, LaPlegua played a solo show at Complex, in Glendale, CA, which was a rare outing of the early instrumental incarnation of the band. The set list included tracks like Brain Bypass, Adult Content, Without Emotions, God Bless, Bulletfuck, Spit, God Wrapped In Plastic, The Kill (Instru-mental Version from "The Frost EP"), God Warrior, and other rarely or never played techno/noise tracks.
Of the evening, LaPlegua said: "It was a rarity show, and I played the show exactly like I did back in the days when it was just me. No point playing obvious songs, when I can do those songs on any given show. I was happy to play all those songs I can never do with the full band, and I could have done a million more. Thanks to everyone coming out last night. I had a blast doing an old school set like this. For those who missed it; I will never do it again, so you missed out. To those who were there, thanks for sharing this night with me."

On April 18, it was announced that the new album will be called "This Is Where Death Begins" with a release date of June 3, 2016. Available on double vinyl and CD, a two-CD version includes a live recording of the Complex, LA, show. A three-CD and DVD version includes audio and video from the Summer Breeze Festival in 2015, making this the band's first official live release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.outofline.de/content/newsletter/newsletter180416-3.htm |title=Combichrist: This Is Where Death Begins – New Album |website=Outofline.de |access-date=May 23, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630093302/http://www.outofline.de/content/newsletter/newsletter180416-3.htm |archive-date=June 30, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===''One Fire'' (2019) ===
Following the 2017 release of standalone track "Broken : United", a new album called "One Fire" was scheduled for a Spring release, delayed from Fall 2018, followed by a US tour in March/April and European shows (some festival, some headline) in June, July, August. Joe Letz announced his departure on January 17, after 13 years as main drummer, ahead of official album/tour announcements and in line with his new sober lifestyle. LaPlegua posted a farewell statement, confirming that "Joe's departure has nothing to do with the band itself. It is about recovery, a different life and spending more time with his family." LaPlegua added that he/Combichrist has "new management, new booking agency, Nick Rossi and Eric 13 working hard with me, Elliot Berlin on keyboards and a new second drummer Will Spodnick."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/YouKnowYoureACombichristFanWhen/posts/2330725590293539|title=You know you're a Combichrist fan when.|website=Facebook.com|access-date=November 17, 2020}}</ref>

=== During COVID-19 ===
LaPlegua set up a Combichrist [[Patreon]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.patreon.com/combichrist/|title=Combichrist is creating monsters, one fire and beyond}}</ref> where he posted some exclusive unreleased Scandy tracks and "Sec Four" which was used in DMC game trailers but never released. During 2020, he continued working on new Combichrist material for a 2022 album - beginning with the single "Not My Enemy" released early 2021 - and confirmed that Elliott Berlin has rejoined the band as a recording and touring member. In addition, the first official solo album will be released under the name LaPlegua - containing some songs that were originally destined for a third Panzer AG album. First single, "I Will Heal" was released online in February 2021, with the post-punk/goth rock album pencilled for a summer release. New material from Icon Of Coil is also in the works, as is a new project of viking techno which will come out under the name HDLGIR. Meanwhile the podcast "Oh Weird! It's Combichrist and Co!"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://open.spotify.com/show/4DwQu1DMFmsnf3kqN6mvJu|title = OH WEIRD! It's Combichrist & Co}}</ref> began recording in early 2021, featuring LaPlegua and his sound/lights crew, Greg Gory and Chris Norris, often with special guests. The band hope to resume touring in late summer (Europe) and autumn/fall (USA) 2021, however guitarist Eric13 would be sitting it out with Jamie Cronander filling in for him. On September 15, 2021 the new single "Compliance" was released, accompanied by a lyric video.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.apple.com/ru/album/compliance-single/1581452275|title = Compliance - Single by Combichrist on Apple Music|date = September 15, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UDa6o6zsUE|title = Combichrist - Compliance (Official Lyric Video)}}</ref>

Combichrist was originally just LaPlegua onstage, followed by LaPlegua plus one other 2003–2006. The lineup then changed and expanded to include Shaun F, Jon Horton, and Joe Letz. Combichrist has existed and played as a solo act, a duo, a trio, a quartet, a quintet, and on occasion has played shows with six members. The Past Members include full and touring members of the band, while the Guest Members includes special appearances for one or two shows only. Elliott Berlin, for example, guested on keys for an old-school show (Glasgow) and on keys with the full band when Z_Marr quit (Berlin), before becoming a full touring member in 2018.
