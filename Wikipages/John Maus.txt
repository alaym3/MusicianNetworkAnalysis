'''John Maus''' (born February 23, 1980) is an American musician, composer, singer, and songwriter known for his [[baritone]] singing style and his use of vintage [[synthesizer]] sounds and [[Medieval music|Medieval]] [[church mode]]s, a combination that often draws comparisons to 1980s [[goth-pop]]. His early [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] recordings anticipated and inspired the late 2000s [[hypnagogic pop]] movement.<ref name="maustmt"/><ref name="vulture2017"/> On stage, he is characterized for his intense displays of emotion while performing. He is also a former teacher of philosophy at the [[University of Hawaii]], where he later earned his [[PhD]] in [[political science]].

Maus' early influences included [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Syd Barrett]], [[Jim Morrison]], and composers of the  [[medieval music|Medieval]], [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]], and [[Baroque music|Baroque]] eras. In 1998, he left his hometown of [[Austin, Minnesota|Austin]], Minnesota to study [[experimental music]] at the [[California Institute of the Arts]]. When he befriended and first worked alongside classmate [[Ariel Pink]], he took a greater interest in [[pop music]]. He produced most of the music from his first two albums ''[[Songs (John Maus album)|Songs]]'' (2006) and ''[[Love Is Real]]'' (2007) on cassette tape with an early 1990s sound bank. The albums generally drew negative reviews upon release, and it was not until the success of his third, ''[[We Must Become the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves]]'' (2011), that he became more widely accepted as an [[outsider music|outsider]] artist. Following a half-decade absence from public appearances and releasing new music, he returned in 2017 with the album ''[[Screen Memories (album)|Screen Memories]]''.

Writings about Maus frequently link his music to his academic vocations, although Maus himself denies composing with an aesthetic or political theory in mind. He says that on some of his songs, his intention is to investigate "forgotten" electronic palettes, harmonies that were historically associated with "the divine", and lyrics which follow certain social idioms to their "absurd conclusions". His [[dissertation]], "Communication and Control" (2014), discusses the influence of technology on [[social control]].

==Biography==
===Early years===

Maus was born and raised in [[Austin, Minnesota]]<ref>{{cite web|title=John Maus|url=http://www.upsettherhythm.co.uk/johnmaus.shtml|website=[[Upset the Rhythm]]}}</ref> and had a [[middle-class]] upbringing.<ref name="RBMA2017"/> The earliest songs he could recall hearing was "[[Chariots of Fire]]" by [[Vangelis]], and after that, early [[MTV]] hits such as [[Jefferson Starship]]'s "[[We Built This City]]" (1985).<ref name="RBMA2017"/> As a teenager, he listened mainly to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[Syd Barrett]],<ref name="bombsite.com">{{cite web|last=Loscutoff|first=Leah|url=http://bombsite.com/issues/1000/articles/5837|title=John Maus|website=[[BOMB Magazine]]|date=July 2011|access-date=July 26, 2011}}</ref> performed in punk bands, and created music with his computer. He said that he began playing an instrument "around 12 or 13" and remembered that "the [only] culture I was exposed to was what was coming through MTV, Top 40 radio and maybe a classic rock station or something like that. ...  I lived out in a very small town, with no boutique record stores and no college kids." Nirvana's "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]" created "a fascination for musical details" for him, and when he got his first bass guitar, "I didn’t take any lessons or learn how to play it. I’d just kind of pluck on the bass and scream my heart out." Afterward, he became fascinated with the life and music of Syd Barrett, and recorded his own version of Barrett's 1970 song "Feel" from ''[[The Madcap Laughs]]''.<ref name="RBMA2017"/>

In 1998, Maus began his undergraduate in music composition at the [[California Institute of the Arts]],<ref name="musique">{{cite web|last1=Batty|first1=Roger|title=I think We're Alone Now|url=https://www.musiquemachine.com/articles/articles_template.php?id=76|website=Musique Machine|date=May 19, 2006}}</ref><ref name="bombsite.com"/> by which time he had formed an appreciation for experimental music, such as the work of [[Michael Pisaro]], as well as [[medieval music|Medieval]], [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque music]]. When he befriended and began to work alongside classmate [[Ariel Pink]] (Ariel Rosenberg), he took a greater interest in [[pop music]].<ref name="bombsite.com"/> The first time he heard Rosenberg play was at a concert put up by students from the visual arts department.<ref name="musique"/> He recalled thinking: "You know, Okay, maybe I’m not going to do experimental music anymore, because I was ... doing all of these performances like [[Morton Feldman|[Morton] Feldman]] and [[John Cage|[John] Cage]]. ...  I left that aside and took up pop as the best bet, largely because of my encounter there with Ariel, and the early work he was doing."<ref name="bombsite.com"/> Rosenberg called Maus "arguably my best friend"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sanders|first1=Christopher|title=I Ate It All Up In Fast Forward: Ariel Pink's Favourite LPs|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/23056-ariel-pink-interview-favourite-albums?page=14|website=[[The Quietus]]|date=August 23, 2017}}</ref> and "my very first fan", and in turn, Maus called him "the zeitgeist embodied. He is the figure of this situation and of this time, of the cloud, of the spectacle gone online."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bevan|first1=David|title=Ariel Pink: In Praise of Guilty Genius|url=https://www.spin.com/2012/08/ariel-pink-in-praise-of-guilty-genius/|website=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=August 21, 2012}}</ref>

After Maus and Rosenberg became roommates,<ref name="vulture2017">{{cite web|last1=Pemberton|first1=Nathan|title=John Maus Is Making Outsider Pop for the End of the World|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/10/john-maus-is-making-outsider-pop-for-the-end-of-the-world.html|website=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]|date=October 25, 2017}}</ref> Maus recorded the material from his first album using a cassette multi-track recorder and an early 1990s synthesizer soundbank.<ref name="musique"/> For a time, Maus was a member of the Haunted Graffiti stage band.<ref name="WMFlb">{{cite web|last1=Weirdo|first1=Bobby|title=Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti - Loverboy (2002)|url=https://www.weirdomusicforever.com/weird-records/2017/1/27/loverboy-ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti-2002|website=Weirdo Music Forever|date=January 27, 2017}}</ref> They collaborated on the title track of Rosenberg's ''[[Lover Boy (album)|Lover Boy]]'' (2002).<ref name="WMFlb"/> Maus said that Rosenberg made contributions to some of his own songs, but was not credited "because neither of us care enough about any 'official' credit."<ref name="BDMpelly"/>  He later completed his degree in experimental music composition in 2003.<ref name="vulture2017"/> By 2005, Maus had also taken about a year in "art criticism or something". For two of his college years, he "couldn’t write a thing ... and it horrified me. ... Nothing did what I felt music ought to do. I had to feel like I’d started to get there, at least in my mind, before I could share it with people." At his most "prolific", he could write only one song a month.<ref name="RBMA2017" />

In 2003, Rosenberg signed to [[Animal Collective]]'s [[Paw Tracks]], and over the next few years, some of his early, self-released CD-Rs were widely distributed for the first time.<ref name="Reynolds2011Field">{{cite web|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|date=May 24, 2011|url=https://reynoldsretro.blogspot.com/2014/08/ariel-pink-field-day-festivals-website.html|title=Ariel Pink|author-link=Simon Reynolds|website=Field Day Festivals}}</ref> Maus had also self-released CD-Rs of his work,<ref name="RBMA2017" /> which he submitted to several labels, including Paw Tracks and [[Kill Rock Stars]], but was rejected.<ref name="musique"/> Both Maus and Rosenberg backed Animal Collective's [[Panda Bear (musician)|Panda Bear]] for his solo tour of Europe, where Maus served as keyboardist.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fink|first1=Matt|title=Panda Bear vs. Ariel Pink - The Full Interview|url=http://www.undertheradarmag.com/interviews/panda_bear_vs._ariel_pink_-_the_full_interview/|website=Under the Radar|date=May 7, 2015}}</ref><ref name="musique"/>{{refn|group=nb|After he showed Lennox [[Guillaume de Machaut]]'s "Rose, Lis, Printemps, Verdure", Lennox went on to sample the piece for "I'm Not" on ''[[Person Pitch]]'' (2007).<ref name="Grisham">{{cite web|last1=Maus|first1=John|title=John Maus|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/guest-lists/8003-john-maus/|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=August 3, 2011}}</ref>}} Sometimes Maus was also the opening act for these shows.<ref name="RBMA2017" />  Eventually, after a performance in London, he encountered agents from [[Upset the Rhythm]], who agreed to distribute his music.<ref name="musique"/> Although Maus' first two official albums ''[[Songs (John Maus album)|Songs]]'' (2006) and ''[[Love Is Real]]'' (2007) generally drew negative reviews upon release, he gradually built a [[cult following]].<ref name="raritiesAM">{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Fred|title=John Maus A Collection of Rarities and Previously Unreleased Material|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-collection-of-rarities-and-previously-unreleased-material-mw0002382216|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

After ''Love Is Real'', Maus was awarded a scholarship to study [[political philosophy]] at the [[University of Hawaii]], where he had a day job as a lecturer. In the evenings, he continued working on music from his office.<ref name="vulture2017"/><ref name="NYTimes2011">{{cite news|last1=Ferguson|first1=W.

He said that he eventually gave up, and instead began "doing lots of chemistry projects and chromatography experiments. I set myself on fire a few times heating inflammable solvents."<ref name="pidgeon2010"/> Meanwhile, he continued his studies at the [[European Graduate School]] in [[Saas Fee]], Switzerland and earned his [[master's degree]].<ref name="NYTimes2011"/> He did not live in Switzerland, "but would go out there in the summers. It's like that [[Black Mountain College|Black Mountain]] thing that they did over here years ago, where they bring out all of the heavy hitters and you can study with them yourself."<ref name="NYTimes2011"/>

One of his professors from the university was the French philosopher [[Alain Badiou]], who would originate the title of his third album ''[[We Must Become the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves]]'' (2011).<ref name="NYTimes2011"/> Maus wrote the album in "search for the perfect pop song."<ref name="RBMA2017"/> After the album's positive response, he grew more widely accepted as an [[outsider music|outsider]] artist, and there was a critical reevaluation of his earlier work. In 2012, the album was followed with the compilation ''[[A Collection of Rarities and Previously Unreleased Material]]''. Spanning recordings from 1999 to 2010, the collection selects outtakes from his previous three albums in addition to tracks which had appeared on other compilations.<ref name="raritiesAM"/> The album was conceived by [[Ribbon Music]]; Maus did not consider it an "official record" but was "grateful that they [the label] thought anybody would be interested in having it."<ref name="RBMA2017" />

In a 2011 ''Pitchfork'' interview, Maus suggested that he was happy that music was increasingly becoming free to the public and that record stores were "coming to an end". The remarks embroiled him in an online controversy, after which he tweeted a lengthy apology which clarified that he was referring to "the Megastores of the world", not "the small DIY record shops".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Beck |first1=Lauren |title=John Maus Explains the Whole Hating on Record Stores Thing |url=https://www.thelmagazine.com/2011/08/john-maus-explains-the-whole-hating-on-record-stores-thing/ |website=The L Magazine |date=August 4, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Jones |first1=Charlie |title=John Maus apologises after angering the internet with speech against record stores |url=https://www.dummymag.com/news/john-maus-apologises-after-dissing-record-stores/ |website=Dummy |date=2011}}</ref>

Maus envisioned that after he completed his [[PhD]] dissertation, he would return to teaching, stating in 2011 that he could not foresee a career in music.<ref>{{cite web|title=PhDs And Dropouts: Killer Mike, Kreayshawn And John Maus Talk School|url=http://www.thefader.com/2011/08/29/phds-and-dropouts-killer-mike-kreayshawn-and-john-maus-talk-school|website=[[The Fader]]|date=August 29, 2011}}</ref> At the same time, he started experimenting with recreational drugs for the first time in his life, "going into [[sensory deprivation tank]]s and just trying any trick I could think of.

===Performances and rhetoric===
[[File:John Maus (2115537441).jpg|thumb|Maus at one of his early "karaoke" performances, 2007]]
On stage, Maus is known for his intense displays of emotion while performing. ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted him as a "ferocious theoretician" who "pogos, head-bangs and gives vent to a succession of feral howls as he jack-knifes at the waist."<ref name="Guardian 2012 Review">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/15/john-maus-review|title=John Maus – review|last=Gittins|first=Ian|work=The Guardian|access-date=January 24, 2013|location=London|date=August 15, 2012}}</ref> Until 2017, he only performed one-man "karaoke shows" in which he sang over prerecorded music.<ref name="oct2017"/> He is also characterized "as much a professional existentialist as he is a synth-pop musician" and that "reading his interviews can make your cerebral cortex pulse with befuddlement."<ref name="Parkin">{{cite web|last=Parkin|first=Chris|website=BBC Music|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/fmfd|title=John Maus We Must Become the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves Review|access-date=May 16, 2012}}</ref> The BBC's Charles Ubaghs distinguished Maus as "a serious believer in pop music. ... Behind these retro overtones is a desire to explore our modern relationships with pop, and its impact on our wider philosophical and cultural lives."<ref name="BBC 2012 review"/> The review also remarked that on Maus' self-referential tendencies: "Couple this with lyrics like The Fear’s surprisingly frank 'What’s wrong with me, ‘cause I’ve tried everything,' and you’ve an accessibly rich portrait of Maus' ever-questioning mind."<ref name="BBC 2012 review">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/gfrj|title= John Maus A Collection of Rarities and Previously Unreleased Material Review|last=Ubaghs|first=Charles|date=August 21, 2012|work=BBC Review|publisher=BBC|access-date=January 24, 2013}}</ref>

Maus relates his erratic stage demeanor to "the [[hysteria|hysterical]] body". Accordingly, the purpose of the display is to combat the "play-acting" involved with live music and affect more sincerity in the performance. This ties in with the idea meant by "we must become the pitiless censors of ourselves".<ref name="gravity"/> As he explains, "What I'm trying to do is appear as something else than the world as it stands ... Because I believe that’s what we all really want, to see one another and to be seen, and my particular wager is that the hysterical body is perhaps exemplary in its affirmation of that ... the sweat of blood is undeniable."<ref name="gravity">{{Cite web |url=http://www.antigravitymagazine.com/2018/02/dragged-through-the-mud-a-conversation-with-john-maus/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-04-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180701145244/http://www.antigravitymagazine.com/2018/02/dragged-through-the-mud-a-conversation-with-john-maus/ |archive-date=2018-07-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dummymag.com/video/john-maus-in-glasslands-performance/|title=John Maus gets hysterical in this Glasslands performance|website=Dummymag.com|access-date=29 April 2019}}</ref>

In various interviews, Maus advocates for "truth" in music.<ref name="FW"/><ref name="maustmt"/> He refers to a tendency of popular music criticism, specifically its reductive engagement with "at-hand genre and at-hand comparison, then it moves on to the next thing. If something remarkable is happening in the work, that’s what people should write about, not the application of some at-hand label maker."<ref name="AtomicBomb">{{cite web|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Rutger|title=John Maus and the Atomic Bomb|url=https://www.nbcsandiego.com/blogs/sounddiego/John-Maus-and-the-Atomic-Bomb-471441774.html|website=nbcsandiego.com|date=January 27, 2018}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb| ''[[Flavorwire]]''{{'}}s Tom Hawking argued that "he's an interesting case because his music doesn’t necessarily discuss the ideas that seem to inform it" unless one considers that the "relative simplicity of his songs, both lyrically and musically, is a way of getting at fundamental truths."<ref name="FW">{{cite web|last1=Hawking|first1=Tom|title=Come Back, John Maus!

It's not 1920. That's not what's going on right now. We live in a completely different situation that, musically, is pop music."<ref name="pidgeon2010">{{cite web|last1=Hazel|first1=Sheffield|title=Interview: John Maus|website=The Stool Pidgeon|url=http://www.thestoolpigeon.co.uk/features/john-maus-interview.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614174323/http://www.thestoolpigeon.co.uk/features/john-maus-interview.html|archive-date=June 14, 2011|date=September 17, 2010}}</ref>}} Another example he gives to describe the reduction is "it sounds like x and y".<ref name="leichtungre">{{cite web|last1=Leichtung|first1=Ric|title=RE: Dear John Maus: How Are You?|url=http://adhoc.fm/post/re-dear-john-maus-how-are-you/|website=Adhoc.fm|date=July 13, 2012}}</ref> He adds that the "truth content of any work, I suppose, is the extent to which it accomplishes something else than what it is."<ref name="AtomicBomb"/>

''[[Slant Magazine]]''{{'}}s Matthew Cole dismissed Maus' philosophical writings as "a parody of [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] social theory" and his music as "obviously some kind of art-school mindfuckery".<ref name="slantmagazine1">{{cite magazine|last=Cole|first=Matthew|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/john-maus-we-must-become-the-pitiless-censors-of-ourselves/2552 |title=John Maus We Must Become the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves &#124; Album Review |magazine=[[Slant Magazine]] |date=June 28, 2011 |access-date=July 9, 2017}}</ref> According to Maus, he does not think about aesthetic theory when "working over the keyboard, or musing over musical ideas in my head. But when discussing it, we want to have some new thought about this new music. I wouldn't claim that my music is new, but generally speaking pop music begs for some kind of radical new way of talking about it."<ref name="BDMpelly">{{cite web|last1=Pelly|first1=Jean|title=John Maus|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interview/8915-john-maus/|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=August 10, 2012}}</ref> He also denies any intention for his work to come off as "a sneering take on pop."<ref name="musique" /><ref name="FW"/>

===Retro sound===
{{quotebox|text= [P]eople talk about [me sounding] like the eighties, [but] I didn't listen to the eighties! ... the whole "eighties" to me was something that comes from listening to Ariel Pink, like "Young Pilot Astray", ''[[The Doldrums (album)|The Doldrums]]'' and this kind of stuff. That was the first I heard a sound like that and wanted to take it up myself.

Although he rejects the label, Maus is recognized as a progenitor of the [[hypnagogic pop]] scene, a genre noted for its reliance on memory and nostalgia.<ref name="maustmt">{{cite web|last=Redmond|first=Jordan|url=http://www.tinymixtapes.com/music-review/john-maus-we-must-become-pitiless-censors-ourselves |title=John Maus - We Must Become The Pitiless Censors Of Ourselves|website=[[Tiny Mix Tapes]] |date=March 30, 2012 |access-date=October 24, 2017}}</ref> His compositions tend to employ the use of particular [[mode (music)|modal]] scales previously associated with Renaissance and Medieval music, which he believes is often mistaken as an attempt to evoke the 1980s.<ref name="newlang"/><ref name="richards"/> The intention, he said, was not "to evoke that time, I just hear that sound and it seems to suit this time right now. ... People associate the kind of harmonies that associate from the modes with the 80s sound, and for me it's not about the 80s, it's about what I think the kind of harmony is that arises from these modes - what I'm interested in."<ref name="newlang"/> He adds: "For whatever reason, the pioneers of electronic music that came out of Sheffield and Manchester in the 1980s became interested in these ecclesiastical modes that, historically, were associated with the divine. ... The palette was there in the 80s so why was it set aside and forgotten? That thread can be taken up again."<ref name="richards"/> He goes on to opine that synthesizers and [[waveform]]s offer more "color and possibility" than the guitar, which he feels is an "exhausted" instrument.<ref name="richards">{{cite web|last1=Richards|first1=Sam|date=November 11, 2011|title=John Maus: 'If my music sounds 80s, you're hearing its medieval backbone'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/nov/12/john-maus-interview|website=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>

His baritone singing style is often compared to [[Ian Curtis]] of [[Joy Division]]. Maus responded that he was not aware of Joy Division until much later in his life and that any similarities are likely due to Curtis sharing "the same heroes as me, like [[Jim Morrison]]."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blackmarquis |first1=Phil |title=Interview: John Maus - November 2017 |url=https://www.reflectionsofdarkness.com/artists-f-j-interviews-86/17886-interview-john-maus-november-2017 |website=Reflections of Darkness |date=December 11, 2017}}</ref>

During Maus' hiatus in the 2010s, various contingents of popular music began indulging in throwbacks to 1980s culture. Maus acknowledged that his early albums may have anticipated this development.<ref name="Spininterview" /><ref name="RBMA2017"/> Commenting on [[vaporwave]]: "even if I said it wasn’t always about retro, I had maybe tried to do that very thing and dropped a thread there for people to pick up on."<ref name="Spininterview" />

===Political views===
In a 2017 interview, Maus placed himself "[[Far-left politics|left of left of left of left]]" on a [[political spectrum]]. He stated that "it comes down to, if you don't have a sort of indignance when you see atrocities committed, you're not communing with the same humanity that I am."<ref name="Noisy2017"/> Furthermore, in response to accusations concerning his association with [[alt-right]] figures, he condemned [[white supremacy]] as a "cult of a race and blood—that's an absolute obscenity. That's nothing other than disaster. That's just inarguably obscene, that sort of ideology."<ref name="Protests2021">{{cite web |last1=Terry |first1=Josh |title=Don't Be Shocked John Maus and Ariel Pink Were at the Pro-Trump Riot in D.C. |url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7v4yd/dont-be-shocked-john-maus-and-ariel-pink-were-at-pro-trump-riot-at-capitol-in-dc |website=Vice |access-date=January 8, 2021 |date=January 7, 2021}}</ref><ref name="Noisy2017"/>

While some of his lyrics are reminiscent of political slogans, such as "Rights for Gays", he commented that his intention was to follow some social idioms "through to [their] absurd conclusions where interesting things are more likely to happen. That's when the politics of aesthetics [comes in]; it's not in the protest lyrics."<ref name="Noisy2017"/> On the song "Cop Killer", he explained, "I'm not talking about shooting or killing a human being, I'm talking about ... the cops in our heads, the cops that are everything other than us, everything inhuman, that would put us to work towards an end other than each other."<ref name="newlang">{{cite web|last1=Bick|first1=Emily|title=Towards A New Language: John Maus Interviewed|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/06499-john-maus-interview|website=[[The Quietus]]|date=June 28, 2011}}</ref>

Asked about current events in a 2018 interview, Maus criticized the American left-wing as inferior to its European counterpart, saying that the former advances "ideas that are so quaint and old fashioned and inadequate to our situation. You know, asking for more rights, and individual liberty, I mean what is this? 1776?" He added that the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement was "the closest" he had ever aligned with contemporary American politics and that there had been a growing hysteria to "call somebody alt right or something but there has been a far left critique of [[identity politics]] in as much as it plays the game of identity and identity is always something that can be put to work by the mechanisms that serve only toward anyone other than us y'know?"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pailler |first1=Robert |title=Our lost conversation with John Maus |url=https://live.wastedtalentmag.com/blog/2020/06/10/a-call-with-john-maus/ |website=Wasted Talent |date=June 10, 2020}}</ref>

In 2021, Maus, alongside Ariel Pink, attended the pro-[[Donald Trump]] protests that led to the [[2021 storming of the United States Capitol|storming of the U.S. Capitol]] in Washington D.C.<ref name="Protests2021"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Monroe |first1=Jazz |title=Ariel Pink Tweets About Attending Pro-Trump White House Rally Yesterday |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/ariel-pink-tweets-about-attending-pro-trump-white-house-rally-yesterday/ |website=Pitchfork |date=January 7, 2021}}</ref> Responding to controversy regarding his presence at the event, Maus tweeted a quote from ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'', a 1937 [[encyclical]] from [[Pope Pius XI]], that condemned [[Nazism]].<ref name="Protests2021"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Yalcinkaya |first1=Gunsell |title=Why John Maus and Ariel Pink attending the pro-Trump riot isn't surprising |url=https://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/51603/1/why-john-maus-and-ariel-pink-attending-the-pro-trump-riot-isn-t-surprising |website=Dazed Digital|date=8 January 2021 }}</ref> After a fan requested further explanation, he replied with an image of [[Edith Stein]], a German-Jewish philosopher and Catholic [[nun]] who was executed by Nazis.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Diggins |first1=Alex |title=Ariel Pink and John Maus: the indie pop stars facing backlash for protesting at Capital [sic] Hill |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/ariel-pink-john-maus-indie-pop-stars-facing-backlash-protesting/ |website=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=January 8, 2021 |access-date=January 11, 2021 |url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Kirkpatrick |first1=Emily |title=Ariel Pink Claims He Was "Peacefully" Joining the Rioters Who Stormed the Capitol |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/01/ariel-pink-john-maus-joined-capitol-hill-riots |website=Vanity Fair}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Brodsky |first1=Rachel |title=Indie musicians Ariel Pink and John Maus under fire for presence at Pro-Trump protest |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/ariel-pink-maus-capitol-riot-b1784099.html |website=Independent|date=7 January 2021 }}</ref>

==Personal life==
According to Maus in 2010, he had been diagnosed "with everything at one point or another. They say you’re [[bipolar disorder|bipolar]] or whatever, but I've never had one of those ... euphoric, manic episodes where I had an exaggerated perception of my own ability, that would be wonderful. But no, I guess depression, or stuff like that." When asked if he had [[autism]], he responded: "No, no, no, no, I only… I don't put much stock in those clinical categorizations in general, I suppose."<ref name="pidgeon2010"/>

In 2017, Maus married Hungarian visual artist [[Kika Karadi]].<ref name="vulture2017"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Stark|first1=Andrew|title=John Maus: Expectations Versus Reality Versus Reality|url=https://www.malibumag.com/unpublished/john-maus|website=Malibu Mag|date=September 2017}}</ref> In May 2018, during a Q&A conducted on [[Reddit]], he commented that she had split from him "about a week and a half ago".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/8jp4qx/im_john_maus_ama/dz1i95x/|title=r/indieheads - I'm John Maus, AMA|website=reddit|language=en|access-date=2018-05-16}}</ref>
