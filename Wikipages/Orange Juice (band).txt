'''Orange Juice''' was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[jangle pop]] band founded in the [[Glasgow]] suburb of [[Bearsden]] as the Nu-Sonics in 1976. [[Edwyn Collins]] formed the Nu-Sonics (named after a model of guitar made by [[Burns_London|Burns]]) with his school-mate Alan Duncan, and was subsequently joined by James Kirk and Steven Daly, who left an act called The Machetes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twee.net/labels/postcard.html|title=Postcard Records - TweeNet|website=Twee.net|access-date=21 August 2017}}</ref> They became Orange Juice in 1979, best known for their only UK [[Top 40]] hit [[hit record|hit]] "[[Rip It Up (Orange Juice song)|Rip It Up]]", which reached number 8 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in February 1983.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

The band released their first singles during 1980 and 1981 on the independent [[Postcard Records]] label founded by [[Alan Horne (producer)|Alan Horne]], along with fellow Scottish bands [[Josef K (band)|Josef K]] and [[Aztec Camera]]. These included "Blue Boy" and "Simply Thrilled Honey".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/jul/20/orange-juice-and-edwyn-collins-10-of-the-best|title=Orange Juice and Edwyn Collins – 10 of the best|first=Malcolm|last=Jack|date=20 July 2016|access-date=21 August 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> Shortly afterwards, this line-up signed to [[Polydor Records]] and recorded their first album, ''[[You Can't Hide Your Love Forever]]''. However, internal tensions led to Kirk and Daly leaving in early 1982 (they would go on to form a short-lived band called Memphis), and for the next two album releases the line-up was Collins and David McClymont on bass guitar and keyboards, with [[Malcolm Ross (musician)|Malcolm Ross]] on guitar, vocals, and keyboards, and drummer [[Zeke Manyika]]. By early 1984, Ross and McClymont had left the group, leaving a core line-up of Collins and Manyika who recorded Orange Juice's final album, ''[[The Orange Juice]]'', with [[Clare Kenny]] and Johnny Britten, produced by [[Dennis Bovell]].

The band's only Top 40 hit, "[[Rip It Up (Orange Juice song)|Rip It Up]]" was achieved with the aid of the synthesizer – it was the first hit to use the [[Roland TB-303]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/seconds/buzzcocks-boredom-orange-juice-rip-it-up.htm|title=Buzzcocks: Boredom / Orange Juice: Rip It Up - Seconds - Stylus Magazine|website=Stylusmagazine.com|access-date=21 August 2017}}</ref>
