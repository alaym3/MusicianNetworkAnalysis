== Career ==
=== 2014â€“2018: Early mixtapes ===
Kirk began taking music seriously between 2014 and 2015.<ref name="The Guardian" /> In 2015, he started off his music career by releasing ''Nonfiction'', his debut [[mixtape]]. He later followed this up with his ''God's Work'' mixtape series, ''Baby Talk'' mixtape series, ''Billion Dollar Baby'', and ''Back on My Baby Jesus Sh*t''. He initially performed under the name Baby Jesus, which he eventually changed out of concern that it had become a distraction.<ref name="NYT">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/arts/music/dababy-kirk.html|title=DaBaby Blew Up.

Kirk got his big break after signing to Arnold Taylor, the president of the South Coast Music Group label, a big radio promoter. Taylor saw Kirk perform around [[North Carolina]] clubs at the time he [Taylor] was launching his label. Taylor had been responsible in the early rise of [[Southern hip hop|Southern rap]] stars including [[Yo Gotti]] and [[Future (rapper)|Future]].<ref name="The Guardian" /> Once they started working together, the team kept building buzz around the South with mixtapes and club shows, while Kirk was finding his sound. Through his deal with South Coast, Kirk signed a short-lived distribution deal with [[Jay-Z]]'s [[Roc Nation]] for his ''Blank Blank'' mixtape that would prove to be his breakout in late 2018.<ref name="NYT" /> Thanks to the guidance of Taylor, and following major label bidding wars, Kirk landed a seven-figure recording deal with [[Interscope]].<ref name="The Guardian" />

== Artistry ==
Charles Holmes of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described Kirk's flow as a "[[staccato]], precise, and brutal rapping style, a syllable-crushing force delivered with such forward momentum it often gives the illusion that he starts rapping before the beat begins". According to Holmes, the most notable example of this effect is in his breakthrough hit "[[Suge (song)|Suge]]".<ref name="RS Year">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/dababy-baby-of-the-year-901697/amp/|title=The Baby of the Year|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|last=Holmes|first=Charles|date=November 14, 2020|access-date=April 3, 2020|archive-date=April 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200408221126/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/dababy-baby-of-the-year-901697/amp/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Speaking on his influences, Kirk has said he studied artists like [[Future (rapper)|Future]], [[Lil Wayne]] and [[Kanye West]], who he says "came up and consistently progressed". He further elaborated: "I've studied all the genius marketers throughout the rap game. I borrow from anybody with something to offer". Jeff Weiss of ''[[The Guardian]]'' favorably compared to Kirk to [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Eminem]], [[Missy Elliott]] and [[Ludacris]], noting the similarities in their musical styles which include "inventive rap stylists unafraid to make videos full of funny parodies and rubber-faced camera goofs".<ref name="The Guardian">{{Cite web|url=https://amp.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/10/dababy-boom-controversial-rapper-taking-over-america|title=DaBaby boom: meet the controversial rapper taking over America|work=[[The Guardian]]|last=Weiss|first=Jeff|date=January 10, 2020|access-date=April 3, 2020|archive-date=March 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200313161353/https://amp.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/10/dababy-boom-controversial-rapper-taking-over-america|url-status=live}}</ref> According to Weiss, Kirk "reflects an [[anachronistic]] approach to the rap game. If the charts are filled with opiated threnodies about addiction and sadness, he eschews singing in favor of raps that could take your head off". Kirk has said "I can't sing, but I'll hit some notes here and there".<ref name="The Guardian" />

The crowd responded by booing, and he left the venue without performing any songs. He said that he struck her because she placed her phone too close to his face while taking a video with the flash on. In a video posted on [[Instagram]], Kirk said, "I do apologize that there was a female on the other end.

=== Homophobic remarks ===
In July 2021, Kirk faced backlash for [[Homophobia|homophobic]] remarks. While performing at the Rolling Loud Festival in [[Miami]] on July 25, he said, "[If] you didn't show up today with [[HIV/AIDS]], or any of them deadly sexually transmitted diseases that'll make you die in two to three weeks, then put a cellphone light in the air.
