'''Ayreon''' {{IPAc-en|audio=Pronunciation-Ayreon.ogg|ˈ|ɛ|ɹ|i|ən}} is a musical project by Dutch songwriter, singer, musician and record producer [[Arjen Anthony Lucassen]]. Ayreon's music is described as [[progressive rock]], [[progressive metal]]<ref name="Ayreon biography">{{cite web |author=Huey, Steve |title=Ayreon biography |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ayreon-mn0000055119/biography |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=2014-10-17}}</ref> and [[power metal]]<ref name="AZ of Power Metal">{{cite book|title=A-Z of Power Metal|last=Sharpe-Young|first=Garry|publisher=Cherry Red Books Ltd.|year=2003|isbn=1-901447-13-8|location=London}}<!--|access-date=2014-10-17 --></ref> sometimes combined with genres such as [[folk music|folk]], [[electronica]], [[experimental music|experimental]] and [[classical music]]. The majority of Ayreon's albums are dubbed [[Rock opera|"rock operas"]] (or "metal operas") because the albums contain complex storylines featuring a host of characters, usually with each one [[List of Ayreon guest musicians|being represented by a unique vocalist]].

Each Ayreon album tells a different story, but all, with the exceptions of ''[[Actual Fantasy]]'', ''[[The Theory of Everything (Ayreon album)|The Theory of Everything]]'', and ''[[Transitus (album)|Transitus]]'', take place in the same fictional, [[science fiction]] universe; additionally, Lucassen's solo album ''[[Lost in the New Real]]'' is also set in the Ayreon universe. Ayreon's music is characterized by the use of traditional instruments in rock music (guitars, bass guitar, drums, [[analog synthesizer|analogue synthesizer]]s, [[electric organ]]s) mixed with instruments more native to folk and classical music (e.g. [[mandolin]]s, violins, [[viola]]s, [[cello|celli]], [[flute]]s, [[sitar]]s and [[didgeridoo]]s). Lucassen writes the music and the lyrics, sings and plays most of the instruments on all of the Ayreon albums, alongside many guest musicians. His most regular collaborator is drummer [[Ed Warby]].

Due to the project's particular nature, Ayreon live performances are rare, and no official Ayreon live show took place until 2017. Several Ayreon songs were first included in two [[live albums]] by other Lucassen bands: ''[[Live on Earth (Star One album)|Live on Earth]]'' by [[Star One (band)|Star One]] (2003) and ''[[Live in the Real World]]'' by [[Stream of Passion]] (2006).

== History ==
=== Origins: ''The Final Experiment'' and ''Actual Fantasy'' (1995–1998) ===
The first Ayreon CD, released in 1995, is ''[[The Final Experiment]]'', which has a mixture of science fiction and medieval themes. The album features thirteen singers and seven instrumentalists, most of them Dutch. ''The Final Experiment'' is often mentioned as one of the first [[metal opera]]s. The album was originally titled ''Ayreon: The Final Experiment'', with the artist listed as Arjen Lucassen, but upon re-release, the title was changed to ''[[The Final Experiment]]'', and the artist was changed to Ayreon.

''[[Actual Fantasy]]'' from 1996 is the only Ayreon album without a continuous story. With its individual [[fantasy]] stories, it can still be considered a [[concept album]], though. There are only three singers and three instrumentalists on Actual Fantasy.  Themes inspired by songs on this album can be found on later Ayreon releases, particularly the two Universal Migrator albums.  The album did not sell as well as its predecessor.

=== Continuation of the Ayreon storyline (1998–2008) ===
The [[double album]] ''[[Into the Electric Castle]]'' followed in 1998, continuing the Ayreon storyline from ''The Final Experiment''. The album features eight singers, each playing a role of a single character, and eleven instrumentalists.  Arjen has stated that he wanted this particular album to be a more flight-and-fancy-free record, or "pure escapism" than the previous albums' more serious tones, and portrayed his characters in more of a [[B movie]] light. The album was a huge success and is widely regarded as one of Ayreon's best albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/ayreon |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120715113151/http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/ayreon |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-15 |title=RateYourMusic ratings of Ayreon albums |website=Rateyourmusic.com |access-date=2010-04-14 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sputnikmusic.com/album.php?albumid=20838|title=SputnikMusic's review of the album|website=Sputnikmusic.com|access-date=2010-04-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=34|title=ProgArchives user ratings of Ayreon's albums|website=Progarchives.com|access-date=2010-04-14}}</ref>

The twin ''Universal Migrator'' albums were released in 2000. The first album, ''[[Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer|The Dream Sequencer]]'' consists of soft, atmospheric progressive rock, whereas the second album, ''[[Universal Migrator Part 2: Flight of the Migrator|Flight of the Migrator]]'', consists of a more heavy-metal theme. Both of the albums feature around ten singers supported by many instrumentalists. One of the more notable guests was [[Bruce Dickinson]] of [[Iron Maiden]], who made an appearance on the ''Flight of the Migrator'' album.

Shortly following ''Universal Migrator'' came ''[[Ayreonauts Only]]'', an album generally meant to be only for diehard fans of Ayreon. The album itself was the second to not follow a specific storyline; it instead contained alternate versions (With different vocalists or instrumentalists) of existing songs, or the original demos used when recording them. In addition, it contained a preview of Arjen's then-upcoming project, [[Ambeon]]. It is the only Ayreon album not to see re-release on InsideOut.

In 2004 came ''[[The Human Equation]]''. As on ''Into the Electric Castle'', there are several singers, each playing their own role. With ''The Human Equation'', Ayreon turned away from the usual science fiction and fantasy themes with a seemingly semi-normal [[psychology|psychological]] theme.

Starting in 2004, after changing from Transmission Records to InsideOut, Arjen began rereleasing his Ayreon catalog on the new label, with enhancements ranging from basic (The Universal Migrator, issued as a two-disc set instead of two separate albums) to drastic (Actual Fantasy, "Revisited" with completely re-recorded drums, bass, synth and flute). In 2005, to coincide with the 10th anniversary of Ayreon, ''The Final Experiment'' was reissued with a bonus semi-acoustic disc.

At the end of September 2006, when Arjen's new studio was finished, he began making a new album entitled ''[[01011001]]'', which was released on 23 January 2008. This album was noticeably darker than previous Ayreon releases, Lucassen attributes this to a depression and his divorce in the preceding year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ragnarokradio.co.uk/2008/04/episode-17-universal-migrator.html |title=Ragnarök Radio Interview Part one |website=Ragnarokradio.co.uk |access-date=2008-04-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716200949/http://www.ragnarokradio.co.uk/2008/04/episode-17-universal-migrator.html |archive-date=16 July 2011 }}</ref>

On 25 April 2008, Arjen released a new Ayreon EP named ''[[Elected (Ayreon EP)|Elected]]''. The EP features two tracks from ''01011001'', one from ''The Human Equation'' and an [[Alice Cooper]] cover (''Elected''), with vocals by Arjen and [[Tobias Sammet]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arjenlucassen.com/blog/new-ayreon-ep-with-a-special-surprise/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120719221741/http://www.arjenlucassen.com/blog/new-ayreon-ep-with-a-special-surprise/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-19 |title=New Ayreon EP – with a special surprise… |publisher=Arjenlucassen.com |access-date=2014-02-20 }}</ref>

On 16 September 2008, Arjen announced in his official website the release of ''[[Timeline (Ayreon album)|Timeline]]'', his second compilation album, that will reunite selected songs from all Ayreon albums and an unreleased one in three CDs and a DVD. The album was released on 7 November 2008 in Germany, Austria and Switzerland and all of the EU on 17 November 2008. It was released in America on 13 January 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arjenlucassen.com/ayreon/ay_news.html |title=Timeline: New Ayreon compilation album |publisher=Arjenlucassen.com |access-date=2014-02-20}}</ref>

=== Hiatus (2008–2012) ===
Arjen took a break from Ayreon and completed a new side project, [[Guilt Machine]], in 2009.  He also went on to release a second [[Star One (band)|Star One]] album in 2010, and then a solo album under his own name in 2012.

=== ''The Theory of Everything'' and ''The Source'' (2012–2017) ===
''The Theory of Everything'' was released on 28 October 2013.  In 2015, ''[[The Human Equation]]'' was performed in its entirety live in an unofficial full-scale theatrical production called ''The Theater Equation'', with Lucassen making an appearance and helping promote the project. It was performed four times, all at the Nieuwe Luxor theater in [[Rotterdam]] between 18 and 20 September. Although produced as an unofficial series of performances, it was recorded and released in June of the following year as an official Ayreon release, ''[[The Theater Equation]]'', produced and mixed by Lucassen himself.<ref name=metalstorm>{{cite web|title=The Human Equation Theater Experience - Coming In 2015, Pre-Registration Starts Today|url=http://www.metalstorm.net/events/news_comments.php?news_id=23524|work=[[Metal Storm (webzine)|Metal Storm]]|access-date=23 May 2014|date=19 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/ArjenLucassenOfficial/photos/a.114351896151.107682.109887886151/10153111557441152/?type=3&theater|title=Ayreon - Timeline {{!}} Facebook|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=2016-10-21}}</ref>

''[[The Source (Ayreon album)|The Source]]'' was released on 28 April 2017, marking a return to [[science fiction]] and the Ayreon storyline. It is Lucassen's first album under his new label, [[Mascot Label Group]].<ref name="Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles">{{cite web|title=Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles|url=http://bravewords.com/news/arjen-lucassen-working-on-new-ayreon-album-for-2017-release-video|access-date=7 October 2016|date=6 October 2016}}</ref>

=== Focus on live performances (2017–2020) ===

In November 2016, Lucassen announced the first ever official Ayreon concerts for September 2017, entitled ''Ayreon Universe''. The show featured 16 singers and 11 instrumentalists, all of which had previously worked together with Lucassen on his studio albums.<ref>{{cite web|title=AYREON Universe: The Best Of Ayreon Live, Out March 30|url=https://www.prog-sphere.com/news/ayreon-universe-best-of-ayreon-live/|access-date=14 January 2018|date=12 January 2018}}</ref> Unlike ''The Theater Equation'', it consisted of unrelated songs from Ayreon performed after each other as in a traditional concert, with a few songs from [[Star One (band)|Star One]] featured as well.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ayreon Universe|url=http://www.arjenlucassen.com/universe/?mc_cid=edb6403609&mc_eid=82f72700e7|access-date=21 November 2016|date=21 November 2016}}</ref> One of the performances was released as a live album/DVD on 30 March 2018, titled ''[[Ayreon Universe – The Best of Ayreon Live]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ayreon Universe set for live release in March|url=http://teamrock.com/news/2018-01-11/ayreon-universe-set-for-live-release-in-march|access-date=14 January 2018|date=12 January 2018}}</ref>

On 7 December 2017, Lucassen stated that a new Ayreon concert would take place on 22 June 2018 at [[Graspop Metal Meeting]], where they would headline the Marquee stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.graspop.be/en/line-up/a-z/by-name/ |title=By name - Graspop Metal Meeting 2018 |publisher=Graspop.be |access-date=2017-12-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Lucassen|first=Arjen Anthony|title=Big news!

Englund]], who had never performed live with Ayreon before, and [[Mark Jansen]] and [[Barry Hay]], who had never collaborated with Lucassen before; Lucassen himself also performed a few songs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lucassen|first=Arjen Anthony|title=The line-up for the Ayreon headline show on the Graspop festival is finally confirmed!|url=https://www.facebook.com/ArjenLucassenOfficial/photos/a.114351896151.107682.109887886151/10155153952856152/?type=3&theater|work=Ayreon's official [[facebook]]|access-date=10 May 2018|date=9 May 2018}}</ref>

Between 13 and 15 September 2019, the album ''[[Into the Electric Castle]]'' was performed in [[ Tilburg]] in its entirety similarly to ''The Theater Equation''  in 2015, this time as official Ayreon performances. [[Fish (singer)|Fish]], Anneke van Giersbergen, [[Damian Wilson]], [[Edward Reekers]], Edwin Balogh, and George Oosthoek returned from the original cast, alongside Ed Warby and flutist Thijs van Leer, who also performed on the original album.

Ayreon was supposed to headline the Night of the Prog Festival in Germany on 18 July 2020 to perform ''Into the Electric Castle'' once again, however the event was cancelled due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref name="Festival2020Cancelled">{{cite web| title=Ayreon Electric Castle Live at Night of the Prog Festival – Cancelled |url=https://www.arjenlucassen.com/content/itec-live-notp/ |work=Lucassen's Official Website |access-date=8 May 2020}}</ref>

=== ''Transitus'' (2020–present) ===

On 8 May 2020, Lucassen revealed on his YouTube channel that his next album would be an Ayreon album, titled ''Transitus'' and to be released the same year; the album would be released alongside a tie-in comic book.<ref name="TransitusReveal">{{cite web |last=Lucassen |first=Arjen Anthony|title=New Ayreon Album Announcement: TRANSITUS (2020 release) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Abn0c5_6ZLM |work=Lucassen's YouTube Channel |date=8 May 2020 |access-date=8 May 2020}}</ref>

On 13 May 2020, he announced the first member of the cast, actor [[Tom Baker]], providing spoken vocals as the character of "The Storyteller".<ref name="GuessingGameBaker">{{cite web |last=Lucassen |first=Arjen Anthony|title=Ayreon - Transitus - Guessing game #1: Tom Baker |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Td_G0a1Qa_U |work=Lucassen's YouTube account |date=13 May 2020 |access-date=13 May 2020}}</ref> The rest of the cast was announced during the following week, also including [[Tommy Karevik]] of [[Kamelot]] and [[Seventh Wonder]] as the lead character of Daniel, Cammie Gilbert of [[Oceans of Slumber]] as Abby, Micheal "Mike" Mills of Toehider as The Statue, [[Amanda Somerville]] as Lavinia, Paul Manzi of [[Arena (band)|Arena]] and [[The Sweet]] as Henry, [[Dianne van Giersbergen]] of [[Ex Libris (band)|Ex Libris]] as The Soprano, [[Threshold (band)|Threshold]] drummer [[Johanne James]] as Abraham, [[Simone Simons]] of [[Epica (band)|Epica]] as The Angel of Death, and [[Dee Snider]] of [[Twisted Sister]] as Daniel's Father; [[Marcela Bovio]] of [[Mayan (band)|MaYaN]] (and Lucassen's former band [[Stream of Passion]]) and Caroline Westendorp of [[The Charm the Fury]] portray a duo of characters known as the Furies.<ref name="TransitusGuessingGameKarevik">{{cite web |last=Lucassen |first=Arjen Anthony |title=Ayreon - Transitus - Guessing Game #2: Tommy Karevik |url=https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=235201451078416|work=Official Facebook Page of Arjen Lucassen's AYREON |date=15 May 2020 |access-date=15 May 2020}}</ref><ref name="TransitusGuessingGameGilbert">{{cite web |last=Lucassen |first=Arjen Anthony |title= Ayreon - Transitus - Guessing game #3: Cammie Gilbert |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgzPGqRdH3c |work=Ayreon's official YouTube|date=19 May 2020 |access-date=20 May 2020}}</ref><ref name="TransitusGuessingGameMills">{{cite web |last=Lucassen |first=Arjen Anthony |title= Ayreon - Transitus - Guessing Game #4: Micheal Mills |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83RXx9M5uI |work=Ayreon's official YouTube|date=26 May 2020 |access-date=26 May 2020}}</ref><ref name="TransitusGuessingGameSomerville">{{cite web |last=Lucassen |first=Arjen Anthony |title= Ayreon - Transitus - Guessing Game #5: Amanda Somerville |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxhW38lZffE |work=Ayreon's official YouTube|date=26 May 2020 |access-date=26 May 2020}}</ref><ref name="TransitusGuessingGameManzi">{{cite web |last=Lucassen |first=Arjen Anthony |title= Ayreon - Transitus - Guessing Game #6: Paul Manzi |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEWhm6Gu00s |work=Ayreon's official YouTube|date=27 May 2020 |access-date=27 May 2020}}</ref><ref name="TransitusGuessingGameVanGiersbergen">{{cite web |last=Lucassen |first=Arjen Anthony |title= Ayreon - Transitus - Guessing Game #8: Dianne van Giersbergen |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBJcyL_Ru9Y |date=8 June 2020 |access-date=10 June 2020}}</ref><ref name="TransitusGuessingGameJames">{{cite web |last=Lucassen |first=Arjen Anthony |title= Ayreon - Transitus - Guessing Game #9: Johanne James |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AGo3VBgJa4 |date=8 June 2020 |access-date=10 June 2020}}</ref><ref name="TransitusGuessingGameSnider">{{cite web |last=Lucassen |first=Arjen Anthony |title= Ayreon - Transitus - Guessing Game #11: Dee Snider |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4yMBBF46AA |date=8 June 2020 |access-date=10 June 2020}}</ref><ref name="TransitusGuessingGameSimons">{{cite web |last=Lucassen |first=Arjen Anthony |title= Ayreon - Transitus - Guessing Game #10: Simone Simons |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UD6YCKw1mKs |date=8 June 2020 |access-date=10 June 2020}}</ref><ref name="TransitusGuessingGameBovio">{{cite web |last=Lucassen |first=Arjen Anthony |title= Ayreon - Transitus - Guessing Game #14: Marcela Bovio |url=https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1157993844580404 |date=13 June 2020 |access-date=18 June 2020}}</ref><ref name="TransitusGuessingGameWestendorp">{{cite web |last=Lucassen |first=Arjen Anthony |title= Untitled |url=https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=687614788689381 |date=16 June 2020 |access-date=18 June 2020}}</ref>

Although they had long lost track of each other, he and Van Emmerloot had worked together 35 years prior, when Lucassen was part of [[Vengeance (band)|Vengeance]] and Van Emmerloot was a session drummer; after becoming curious about what had happened to Van Emmerloot since their last meeting, Lucassen looked his drumming videos on YouTube and realized he would be a perfect fit for ''Transitus''.<ref name="TransitusVanEmerloot">{{cite web |last=Lucassen |first=Arjen Anthony |title= Ayreon - Transitus - Juan Van Emmerloot |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_t9JE1YUdg |date=1 July 2020 |access-date=1 July 2020}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
Lucassen said, "Though I do like the similarity of the sound of my own name Arjen and the project name Ayreon, this is purely coincidental. Yet no one seems to believe that! Originally I called the leading character of the first Ayreon album 'Aries'. But then I had to change it because it had to fit the meter of the song. I wanted the new name to sound old fashioned because of the medieval influences, so I used the old-English sounding 'AY' (Aylesbury, Ayrshire). But I also wanted it to sound modern because of the futuristic parts ("2084") so I used 'ON' (electron, neutron, etc.), hence 'Ayreon'."<ref>{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Gary|title=Ayreon – Interviewed by Gary Hill|url=http://www.musicstreetjournal.com/interviews_display.cfm?id=100098|work=Music Street Journal|access-date=3 June 2013|date=March 2008}}</ref>
