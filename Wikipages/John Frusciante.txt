'''John Anthony Frusciante''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=Frusciante.ogg|f|r|uː|ˈ|ʃ|ɑː|n|t|eɪ}}; born March 5, 1970) is an American musician and the guitarist of the rock band [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], with whom he has recorded five studio albums. He has released 12 solo albums and seven EPs.

Frusciante joined the Chili Peppers at the age of 18 after the death of guitarist [[Hillel Slovak]], and appeared on their album ''[[Mother's Milk]]'' (1989). His second album with the band, ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'' (1991), was their breakthrough success. However, he was overwhelmed by the band's newfound popularity and as a result quit in 1992. He became a recluse and entered a long period of [[heroin]] addiction, during which he released his first recordings: ''[[Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt]]'' (1994) and ''[[Smile from the Streets You Hold]]'' (1997). In 1998, he completed [[drug rehabilitation]] and rejoined the band. Their albums ''[[Californication (album)|Californication]]'' (1999), ''[[By the Way]]'' (2002) and ''[[Stadium Arcadium]]'' (2006) were major commercial successes. He left the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 2009 to focus on solo work, and rejoined in 2019.

Frusciante's solo work encompasses genres including [[experimental rock]], [[ambient music]] and [[electronica]]. He released six albums in 2004, each exploring different genres and recording techniques. In 2009, Frusciante released ''[[The Empyrean]]'', which features Chili Peppers bassist [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] and guitarist [[Josh Klinghoffer]]. Frusciante also releases [[acid house]] under the alias '''Trickfinger'''. With Klinghoffer and [[Joe Lally]], he has released two albums as [[Ataxia (band)|Ataxia]].

Frusciante was named one of the greatest guitarists by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and [[Gibson]], and in a [[BBC]] poll. He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 2012.

A year later, Frusciante and his mother moved to [[Mar Vista, Los Angeles, California|Mar Vista]], Los Angeles, with his new stepfather, who, he says, "really supported me and made me feel good about being an artist".<ref name="gpm1"/> He became involved in the Los Angeles [[punk rock]] scene. At age nine he became fixated on [[The Germs]], listening repeatedly to their album ''[[(GI)]]''. He would later use a non-standard tuning of his own invention to play songs from the album single-finger [[Barre chord|barre]].<ref name="gpm1"/>

==Career==
===1988–1992: First term with the Red Hot Chili Peppers===
Frusciante discovered the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] around 1984 when his guitar instructor was auditioning as a guitarist for them.<ref name="Kramer">{{cite web|url=http://www.johnfrusciante.com/articles.php#inter03|title=John Frusciante talks to Dan Kramer|author=Kramer, Dan|publisher=Johnfrusciante.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821182509/http://www.johnfrusciante.com/articles.php|archive-date=August 21, 2007|access-date=August 31, 2007}}</ref> Frusciante attended a Red Hot Chili Peppers performance at age 15 and rapidly became a devoted fan.<ref name="rs-fricke"/> He idolized guitarist [[Hillel Slovak]], familiarizing himself with virtually all the guitar and bass parts from the Red Hot Chili Peppers' first three records. He became acquainted with Slovak; the two spoke months before Slovak's death:<ref name=raw1>{{cite web|url=http://johnfrusciante.com/articles.php#raw01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011180908/http://johnfrusciante.com/articles.php#raw01|archive-date=October 11, 2007|author=Nelson, Artie|date=November 23, 1994|title=Space Cadet|access-date=August 31, 2007|publisher=Raw Magazine, Issue #163}}</ref>

{{quote|Hillel asked me, "Would you still like the Chilis if they got so popular they played the [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|Forum]]?" I said, "No. It would ruin the whole thing. That's great about the band, the audience feels no different from the band at all." There was this real kind of historical vibe at their shows, none of the frustration that runs through the audience when they jump around and can't get out of their seat. I didn't even watch the shows. I'd get so excited that I'd flip around the slam pit the whole time. I really felt like a part of the band, and all the sensitive people in the audience did too.|author=|title=|source=}}

Frusciante became friends with former [[Dead Kennedys]] drummer [[D. H. Peligro]] in early 1988. They jammed together, and Peligro invited his friend, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist [[Flea (musician)|Flea]]. Frusciante and Flea developed musical chemistry immediately, with Flea later acknowledging that might have been the day he first played the bass riff to the future track "[[Nobody Weird Like Me]]".<ref>''Mother's Milk'' 2003 reissue liner notes</ref> Around the same time, Frusciante intended to audition for Frank Zappa's band, but changed his mind as Zappa strictly prohibited illegal drug use. Frusciante said, "I realized that I wanted to be a rock star, do drugs and get girls, and that I wouldn't be able to do that if I was in Zappa's band."<ref name="gpm1"/>

Slovak died of a heroin overdose in 1988. Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer [[Jack Irons]], devastated, left the group. Remaining members Flea and vocalist [[Anthony Kiedis]] recruited Peligro on drums and [[DeWayne "Blackbyrd" McKnight]], formerly of [[Parliament-Funkadelic]], on guitar.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 234</ref> However, McKnight failed to connect musically within the group. Flea proposed auditioning Frusciante, whose intimate knowledge of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' repertoire impressed him. Flea and Kiedis auditioned him and agreed that he would be a suitable replacement for McKnight.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 239</ref> When Flea called Frusciante with the news of his acceptance, Frusciante ran through his house screaming with joy and jumped on a wall, leaving permanent boot marks.<ref name=vh1btm>{{cite episode | title = Red Hot Chili Peppers | url = http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/behind_the_music/51363/episode_about.jhtml | series = [[Behind the Music]] | network = [[VH1]] | airdate = May 30, 1999 | access-date=August 27, 2007}}</ref> He was considering a contract with [[Thelonious Monster]] at the time—and had been playing with the act for two weeks—but his unanticipated reception into the Red Hot Chili Peppers prompted him to change his plans.<ref name=GuitarMag1>Forsythe, Tom. (February 1991) "Laughing All the Way". ''Guitar Magazine''.</ref>

Frusciante was not familiar with the funk genre of Red Hot Chili Peppers' sound, saying, "I wasn't really a funk player before I joined the band. I learned everything I needed to know about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillel's playing and I just took it sideways from there."<ref name=apter181>Apter, 2004. p. 181</ref> Several weeks into the band's new lineup, Peligro, whose performance was suffering due to extreme drug abuse, was fired.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 242</ref> Soon after, [[Chad Smith]] was recruited as drummer and the new lineup began recording their first album, ''[[Mother's Milk]]'' (1989). Frusciante focused on emulating Slovak's style. Producer [[Michael Beinhorn]] disagreed with this approach and wanted Frusciante to play with an uncharacteristic [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] tone, largely absent from the band's three preceding records.<ref name=p.249>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 249</ref> Frusciante and Beinhorn fought frequently over guitar tone and layering; Beinhorn prevailed, as Frusciante felt pressured by his knowledge of the studio.<ref name=p.249/> Kiedis recalls that "[Beinhorn] wanted John to have a big, crunching, almost metal-sounding guitar tone whereas before we always had some interesting acid-rock guitar tones as well as a lot of slinky, sexy, funky guitar tones".<ref name=scartissue239>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 239–241</ref>

The band collaborated with producer [[Rick Rubin]] for their second record with Frusciante, ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'' (1991). Rubin felt that it was important to record the album in an unorthodox setting and suggested an old [[Hollywood Hills]] mansion.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 284</ref> Frusciante, Kiedis and Flea isolated themselves there for the duration of the recording. Frusciante and Flea seldom went outside and spent most of their time smoking [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].<ref name="tgm2002">Dalley, Helen (August 2002). "John Frusciante" ''Total Guitar''. Retrieved on August 27, 2007.</ref> Around this time, Frusciante began a side project with Flea and [[Jane's Addiction]] drummer [[Stephen Perkins]], the Three Amoebas. They recorded roughly 10 to 15 hours of material, which went unreleased.<ref name=raw1/>

''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' peaked at number three on the ''Billboard'' charts and went on to sell 13 million copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=red hot chili peppers|bio=true}}|author=Prato, Greg|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers biography|access-date=September 12, 2007|magazine=Billboard}}</ref> The unexpected success turned the Red Hot Chili Peppers into rock stars. Frusciante was blindsided by his newfound fame and struggled to cope. Soon after the album's release, he began to develop a dislike for the band's popularity. Kiedis recalled that he and Frusciante used to get into heated discussions backstage after concerts: "John would say, 'We're too popular. I don't need to be at this level of success. I would just be proud to be playing this music in clubs like you guys were doing two years ago.'"<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 229</ref> Frusciante later said that the band's rise to popularity was "too high, too far, too soon. Everything seemed to be happening at once and I just couldn't cope with it".<ref>{{cite web|last=Gabriella. |url=http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/rhcp_int.htm |title="Interview with the Red Hot Chili Peppers".

Frusciante also began to feel that destiny was leading him away from the band. When the Red Hot Chili Peppers began their world tour, he started to hear voices in his head telling him "you won't make it during the tour, you have to go now".<ref name="selvaggio">{{cite web|url=http://www.johnfrusciante.com/interviews/translation_mucchioselvaggio.pdf|title= "John Frusciante: Perso e Ritrovato" (English translation as pdf file)|publisher=Il Mucchio.

To balance it out, I had to be extra-humble, extra-anti-rock star."<ref name="rise">"The Chili Peppers Rise Again". ''Rolling Stone''. Retrieved on August 8, 2007</ref> He refused to take the stage during a performance at Tokyo's Club Quattro on May 7, 1992, telling his bandmates that he was leaving the band. He was persuaded to perform but left for California the next morning.<ref name="vh1btm" /> "It was just impossible for me to stay in the band any longer", he said. "It had come to the point where even though they wanted me in the band, it felt like I was forced out of the band. Not by any members in particular or management in particular, but just the direction it was going."<ref name="rockinfreak">Broxvoort, Brian (1994). "John Frusciante Goes Over a Bridge." ''Rockinfreakapotamus''.</ref> He was replaced by former [[Jane's Addiction]] guitarist [[Dave Navarro]].

In a 2015 interview, [[Cris Kirkwood]] said that following Frusciante's departure from the band in 1992, Frusciante auditioned for the [[Meat Puppets]]. Kirkwood said, "He showed up with his guitar out of its case and barefoot. We were on a major label then, we just got signed, and those guys had blown up to where they were at and John needed to get out. John gets to our pad and we started getting ready to play and I said, 'You want to use my tuner?' He said, 'No, I'll bend it in.' It was so far out. Then we jammed but it didn't come to anything. Maybe he wasn't in the right place and we were a tight little unit. It just didn't quite happen but it could have worked."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://classicrock.teamrock.com/news/2015-05-07/frusciante-wanted-meat-puppets-gig |title=Frusciante wanted Meat Puppets gig |last=Munro|first=Scott|date=May 7, 2015|work=Team Rock|access-date=May 13, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001008/https://classicrock.teamrock.com/news/2015-05-07/frusciante-wanted-meat-puppets-gig |archive-date=March 4, 2016 }}</ref>

===1992–1997: Drug addiction and first solo albums===
Frusciante developed serious drug habits while touring with the band during the previous four years. He said that when he "found out that Flea was stoned out of his mind at every show, that inspired me to be a pothead".<ref name="hightimes">Kennealy, Tim (July 1995). "Chilly Pepper". ''[[High Times]]''.</ref> He used [[heroin]] and was on the verge of full-scale addiction. Upon returning to California in 1992, Frusciante entered a deep depression, feeling that his life was over and that he could no longer write music or play the guitar.<ref name="selvaggio" /> He spent the next three years holed up in his Hollywood Hills home, the walls of which were badly damaged and covered in graffiti.<ref name="papermag">{{cite web | url = http://www.papermag.com/arts_and_style/2004/03/john-frusciante.php | title = Blood Sugar Sex Magic: Damaged Genius John Frusciante is Back, Again! | last = Zafiais | first = Alex | publisher = Papermag | date = March 24, 2004 | access-date = August 13, 2006 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110604033626/http://www.papermag.com/arts_and_style/2004/03/john-frusciante.php | archive-date = June 4, 2011 }}</ref> During this time, his friends [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Gibby Haynes]] went to his house and filmed a documentary short, ''[[Stuff (film)|Stuff]]'', depicting the squalor in which he was living.<ref name="papermag" /> The house was eventually destroyed by a fire that claimed his vintage guitar collection along with several recorded tapes of music.<ref name="DiPerna">Di Perna, Alan (July 2006). "Guided by Voices". ''Guitar World''.</ref>

Frusciante focused on painting, producing 4-track recordings he had made while working on ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' and writing short stories and screenplays. To cope with his worsening depression, Frusciante increased his heroin use and spiraled into a life-threatening dependency.<ref name="rsm1" /> His use of heroin to medicate his depression was a clear decision: "I was very sad, and I was always happy when I was on drugs; therefore, I should be on drugs all the time. I was never guilty—I was always really proud to be an addict."<ref>Sullivan, Kate (August 2002). "Interview with Flea, Anthony and John". ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''.</ref>

As long as I'm obeying those forces, it's always going to be meaningful. I could be playing guitar and I could say 'Play something that sucks,' and if I'm in that place, it's gonna be great.

A 1996 article in the ''[[New Times LA]]'' described Frusciante as "a skeleton covered in thin skin" who at the nadir of his addictions nearly died from a blood infection.<ref name="pnt" /> His arms became fiercely scarred from improperly shooting heroin and [[cocaine]], leaving permanent [[abscess]]es.<ref name="rise" /> 

Frusciante released his second solo album, ''[[Smile from the Streets You Hold]]'', in 1997. The album's first track, "Enter a Uh", is characterized by cryptic lyrics and hysterical screeches. Frusciante also coughs throughout the track, showcasing his deteriorating health. By his admission, he released the album to get "drug money" and withdrew it from the market in 1999. The album is also notable for including a recording called "Height Down", which features River Phoenix.<ref name="jfcom-sm">{{cite web|publisher=Johnfrusciante.com|url=http://www.johnfrusciante.com/music/smile.php|title=''Smile from the Streets You Hold''|access-date=September 4, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928042137/http://www.johnfrusciante.com/music/smile.php |archive-date=September 28, 2007}}</ref>

===1998–2002: Rehabilitation and return to the Chili Peppers===
In late 1996, after more than five years of addiction to heroin, Frusciante went [[cold turkey]].<ref name=guitarplayer1997>{{cite web|title=Guitar Player interview, November 1997|url=http://invisible-movement.net/articles/1997-press/11-guitarplayer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220124618/http://invisible-movement.net/articles/1997-press/11-guitarplayer|archive-date=December 20, 2013}}</ref> However, months later, he was still unable to break addictions to [[crack cocaine]] and alcohol.<ref name=p.407>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 407</ref> In January 1998, urged by his longtime friend [[Bob Forrest]], Frusciante checked into Las Encinas, a [[drug rehabilitation]] clinic in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]].<ref name=p.407/> He was diagnosed with a potentially lethal oral infection, which could only be alleviated by removing his rotten teeth and replacing them with dental implants.<ref name=gpm1/> He also received skin grafts to help repair the abscesses on his ravaged arms.<ref name="papermag"/> About a month later, Frusciante checked out of Las Encinas.<ref name=p.408>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 408</ref>

Frusciante began living a more spiritual, [[asceticism|ascetic]] lifestyle. He changed his diet, becoming more health-conscious and began eating mostly unprocessed foods.<ref name=selvaggio/> Through regular practice of [[vipassana]] and [[yoga]], he discovered the effect that self-discipline has on the body.<ref name=DiPerna/> To maintain his increased spiritual awareness and reduce distraction from his music, Frusciante decided to [[Sexual abstinence|abstain from sexual activity]], stating, "I'm very well without it."<ref name="selvaggio"/> His attitude toward drug use changed, saying:<ref name=rsm1>"Water Music".

{{quote|I don't need to take drugs. I feel so much more high all the time right now because of the type of momentum that a person can get going when you really dedicate yourself to something that you really love. I don't even consider doing them, they're completely silly. Between my dedication to trying to constantly be a better musician and eating my health foods and doing yoga, I feel so much more high than I did for the last few years of doing drugs.

At this point I'm the happiest person in the world. These things do not fuck with me at all, and I'm so proud of that—you don't know how proud I am. It's such a beautiful thing to be able to face life, to face yourself, without hiding behind drugs; without having to have anger towards people who love you. There are people who are scared of losing stuff, but you don't lose anything for any other reason than if you just give up on yourself.}}

Despite his experience with addiction, Frusciante does not view his drug use as a "dark period" in his life. He considers it a period of rebirth, during which he found himself and cleared his mind.<ref name=kerrang1>Bryant, Tom. (May 3, 2006) "War Ensemble." ''Kerrang!''</ref> Frusciante has since stopped practicing yoga due to its effects on his back, but he still tries to meditate daily.<ref name=DiPerna/>

In early 1998, the Red Hot Chili Peppers fired guitarist [[Dave Navarro]] and were on the verge of breaking up. Flea told Kiedis, "[T]he only way I could imagine carrying on [with the Red Hot Chili Peppers] is if we got John back in the band."<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 404</ref> With Frusciante free of his addictions and ailments, Kiedis and Flea thought it was an appropriate time to invite him back. When Flea visited him at his home and asked him to rejoin the band, Frusciante began sobbing and said, "[N]othing would make me happier in the world."<ref name=p.408/> With Frusciante back on guitar, the group began recording their next album, ''[[Californication (album)|Californication]]'', released in 1999. Frusciante's return restored a key component of the band's sound, as well as a healthy morale. He brought with him his deep devotion to music, which affected the band's recording style during the album.<ref name=tgm2002/> Frusciante has frequently stated that his work on ''Californication'' was his favorite.<ref name=tgm2002/>

During the ''Californication'' world tour, Frusciante continued to compose new material, much of which would be released in 2001 on his third solo album ''[[To Record Only Water for Ten Days]]''. The album was stylistically unlike his previous records, less markedly [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream-of-consciousness]] or [[avant-garde]]. However, the lyrics were still very cryptic and its sound was notably stripped down.<ref name=Chonin>{{cite magazine| title=''To Record Only Water for Ten Days'' review |author=Chonin, Neva|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/johnfrusciante/albums/album/103023/review/5942707/to_record_only_water_for_ten_days|date=February 5, 2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525091015/http://rollingstone.com/artists/johnfrusciante/albums/album/103023/review/5942707/to_record_only_water_for_ten_days|archive-date=May 25, 2009| url-status=dead |magazine = Rolling Stone}}</ref> The songwriting and production of ''To Record Only Water for Ten Days'' were more efficient and straightforward than on his previous recordings.<ref name=Chonin/> The album strayed from the alternative rock he had just written with the Red Hot Chili Peppers on ''Californication'', focusing more on [[electronica|electronic]] and [[New wave music|new wave]] elements.<ref name=TROWFTD>{{cite web|publisher=Johnfrusciante.com|url=http://www.johnfrusciante.com/music/ten_days.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017023538/http://www.johnfrusciante.com/music/ten_days.php|archive-date=October 17, 2007|title=''To Record only Water for Ten Days''|date=February 13, 2001|access-date=January 11, 2009}}</ref> In addition to his guitar work, Frusciante experimented with a variety of synthesizers, a distinctive feature of the record.<ref name=TROWFTD/>

In 2001, Frusciante began recording his fourth album with Red Hot Chili Peppers, ''[[By the Way]]'' (2002); he considered the time to be among the happiest in his life.<ref name=tgm2002/> He relished the chance the album gave him to "keep writing better songs".<ref name=tgm2002/> While working on ''By the Way'', he also composed most of what would become ''[[Shadows Collide with People]]'', as well as the songs created for the film ''[[The Brown Bunny]]''.<ref>Guitar World Acoustic, February/March 2004.</ref> His goal to improve his guitar playing on the album was largely driven by a desire to emulate guitar players such as [[Johnny Marr]], [[John McGeoch]] and [[Andy Partridge]]. He wanted to listen to these musicians "who weren't just about technique but more about textures", or as he put it, "people who used good chords".<ref name=tgm2002/> The album marked Frusciante's shift to a more group-minded mentality within the Red Hot Chili Peppers, viewing the band as a cohesive unit rather than as four separate entities.<ref name=tgm2002/>

===2002–2007: The Mars Volta, 2004 recordings and ''Stadium Arcadium''===
Frusciante wrote and recorded a plethora of songs during and after the ''By the Way'' tour. In February 2004, he started a side project with [[Joe Lally]] of [[Fugazi (band)|Fugazi]] and [[Josh Klinghoffer]], called [[Ataxia (band)|Ataxia]].

In early 2005, Frusciante entered the studio to work on his fifth studio album with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, ''[[Stadium Arcadium]]''. His guitar playing is dominant throughout the album, and he provides backing vocals on most of the tracks. Although usually following a "less is more" style of guitar playing,<ref>Walker, James.

He also changed his approach to his playing, opting to contribute solos and let songs form from jam sessions. In an interview from ''Guitar World'', Frusciante explained how he approached his guitar solos for their album ''Stadium Arcadium'' completely differently from those for their previous albums. On ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' and ''Californication'', Frusciante had a general idea how he wanted his guitar solos to sound. For Stadium Arcadium, almost every guitar solo was completely improvised by Frusciante on the spot.<ref>Perna, Alan. "Guided by Voices." Guitar World July 2006: 57.

===2010–2019: Shift to electronic music===
After his departure from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Frusciante became more serious about his longtime dream to make electronic music. As he explained on his blog, "I started to learn how to program all the instruments we associate with Acid House music and some other hardware. Then I started recording, playing 10 or so synced machines through a small mixer into a CD burner. This was all experimental Acid House, my skills at making rock music playing no part in it whatsoever. I had lost interest in traditional songwriting and I was excited about finding new methods for creating music."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://johnfrusciante.com/article/my-recent-history|title=My Recent History|access-date=July 26, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812050814/http://johnfrusciante.com/article/my-recent-history|archive-date=August 12, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> During that time Frusciante began an electronic trio with [[Aaron Funk]] and Chris McDonald under the name [[Speed Dealer Moms]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.factmag.com/2009/01/07/speed-dealer-moms/ |title=Speed Dealer Moms ... – FACT magazine: music and art |publisher=Factmag.com |date=January 7, 2009 |access-date=September 17, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527234555/http://www.factmag.com/2009/01/07/speed-dealer-moms/ |archive-date=May 27, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://invisible-movement.net/info/speed-dealer-moms |title=Speed Dealer Moms |website=John Frusciante Unofficial – Invisible Movement |date=April 20, 2014 |access-date=April 25, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421065251/http://invisible-movement.net/info/speed-dealer-moms |archive-date=April 21, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Their first EP was released in December 2010 on [[Planet Mu Records]].<ref>{{cite web |title=FINALLY!

Prior to that, on August 16, he also released a free download of the non-album song "Walls and Doors".

Frusciante released an instrumental song named ''Wayne'' on April 7, 2013, through his website.

''Medieval Chamber'', the second album by Black Knights, was released on January 14, 2014. All the music featured on the record was produced by Frusciante, with a few tracks featuring his vocals as well.

He writes, "I also must clear something up. I normally don't read my press, but I heard about this quote, recently taken out of context by some lame website and made into a headline, in which I said 'I have no audience'. This has been misinterpreted, and by no fault of the excellent journalist who interviewed me for the fine publication ''Electronic Beats''. ... Obviously I have a public audience. I am aware of them, and they know who they are." He continues, "Reduced to a single sentence, it would have been accurate to say that, at this point, I have no particular audience in mind while I am making music."<ref name=":0" />

On June 13, 2017, Frusciante, under the alias of Trickfinger, announced that he would be releasing his second studio album ''[[Trickfinger II]]'' on September 8, 2017, on the label Acid Test.

In an interview with Blare Magazine Omar Rodríguez-López, when asked about possible future collaborations with John, stated: "Maybe in the future, but John's in a different place right now. He's in a place where he couldn't care less about putting things out or about something being a product. He's living by different standards right now with a different philosophy, so he doesn't want to be a part of anything that he knows is going to end up being a product. A Mars Volta record definitely ends up being a product".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blaremagazine.com/2012/03/07/interview-the-mars-volta/ |title=Interview: The Mars Volta « |publisher=Blaremagazine.com |access-date=May 13, 2012}}</ref>

==Musical style==
{{quote box|quote=When the intellectual part of guitar playing overrides the spiritual, you don't get to extreme heights.|source=—John Frusciante (''Rolling Stone'', February 2007)<ref name=fricke/>|width=310px}}

Frusciante's musical style has evolved over the course of his career. Although he received moderate recognition for his early guitar work, it was not until later in his career that music critics and guitarists alike began to fully recognize it: in October 2003, he was ranked eighteenth in ''Rolling Stone'''s list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time".<ref name=fricke>Fricke, David.

[[File:John Frusciante strat.jpg|thumb|right|Frusciante playing his signature Fender Stratocaster]]

In general, his sound is also defined by an affinity for vintage guitars. All the guitars that he owns, records, and tours with were made before 1970.<ref name=cantstopmaking>Making of "Can't Stop" music video.

He has since stopped using it, saying there was "no room for it".<ref name=guitarx/> Virtually all of Frusciante's acoustic work is played with a 1950s [[C. F. Martin & Company|Martin]] 0–15.<ref name="Guitar Player" /><ref name=guitaristmag/>

After leaving the Red Hot Chili Peppers, he switched to using a [[Yamaha]] SG as his primary guitar for his solo work.<ref name=Tessa>{{cite web |first=Tessa |last=Jeffers |title=John Frusciante: War and Peace |publisher= Premierguitar.com |date=March 3, 2014 |url=http://www.premierguitar.com/articles/20428-john-frusciante-war-and-peace?page=3 |access-date=July 2, 2014}}</ref> "With the Yamaha SG, I could play along with guitar players who were playing, say, Les Pauls, and feel like the sound matched what I was hearing on the record. ...

The MC-202 has been his primary melodic instrument in his electronic music.<ref name=RecentHistory>{{cite web|last=Frusciante|first=John|title=My Recent History|url=http://johnfrusciante.com/2012/07/09/my-recent-history/|access-date=February 17, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117214047/http://johnfrusciante.com/2012/07/09/my-recent-history/|archive-date=January 17, 2013}}</ref>

With the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Frusciante provided backing vocals in a [[falsetto]] tenor, a style he started on ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''. He thoroughly enjoyed his role in the Chili Peppers as backing vocalist, and said that backing vocals are a "real art form".<ref name=radio>{{cite web|url=http://www.locborg.de/fru/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=806&Itemid=124 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212095842/http://www.locborg.de/fru/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=806&Itemid=124 |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 12, 2008 |title=Radio interview |date=April 3, 2004 |access-date=September 2, 2007 }}</ref> Despite his commitment to the Chili Peppers, he felt that his work with the band should remain separate from his solo projects. When he returned to the Chili Peppers in 1998, Kiedis wanted the band to record "Living in Hell", a song Frusciante had written several years before. Frusciante refused, feeling that the creative freedom he needed for his solo projects would have conflicted with his role in the band.<ref name=radio/>

===Technique===
Frusciante's guitar playing employs emphasis on appropriate melody, tone, and structure rather than virtuosity. Although virtuoso influences can be heard throughout his career, he has said that he often minimizes this.<ref name=Kerrangspain>''Kerrang!'' Issue #21; pp. 76–82</ref> He feels that in general, guitar mastery has not evolved much since the 1960s and considers the greatest players of that decade unsurpassed.<ref name=Kerrangspain/> When he was growing up in the 1980s, many mainstream guitarists focused on speed. Because of this, he thinks that the skills of many defiant new wave and punk guitarists were largely overlooked.<ref name="tgm2002"/> Therefore, he accentuates the melodically driven technique of players such as [[Matthew Ashman]] of [[Bow Wow Wow]] and [[Bernard Sumner]] of [[Joy Division]] as much as possible because he thinks that their style has been overlooked and consequently underexplored.<ref name="tgm2002"/> Despite this, he considers himself a fan of technique-driven guitarists like [[Randy Rhoads]] and [[Steve Vai]], but represses an urge to emulate their style: "People believe that by playing faster and creating new playing techniques you can progress forward, but then they realize that emotionally they don't progress at all. They transmit nothing to the people listening and they stay at where Hendrix was three decades ago. Something like that happened to Vai in the 80s."<ref name=Kerrangspain/> Believing that focusing only on "clean tones" is negative, Frusciante developed an interest in playing with what he calls a "grimy" sound. As a result, he considers it beneficial to "mistreat" his guitar and employ various forms of distortion when soloing.<ref name=Kerrangspain/> He also tries to break as many "stylistic boundaries" as he can to expand his musical horizons. He thinks that much of the output from today's guitarists is unoriginal and that many of his contemporaries "follow the rules with no risk".<ref name=Kerrangspain/>

Frusciante has stated that he became serious about creating and engineering his electronic music in 2007. As he progressed in enhancing his skills with electronic instruments and techniques, he has stated that he felt comfortable with how [[R&B]] and [[hip hop music]] integrated into his work. He has noted that these and other new techniques were all influences on his EP, ''Letur-Lefr''.<ref name=RecentHistory/> ''PBX Funicular Intaglio Zone'' was recorded while Frusciante looked to find new ways to play the guitar with the new forms of music and production that he had been studying. In his blog post, "My Recent History," he notes that "Aspects of PBX are the realization of combinations of styles of music I saw in my head many years ago, as potentials, but which I had no idea how to execute."<ref name=RecentHistory/>

Frusciante's approach to album composition has changed. On his early recordings, he welcomed sonic imperfections, noting that "even on [''To Record Only Water for Ten Days''] there are off-pitch vocals and out-of-tune guitars."<ref name=guitarplayer2006/> However, on later albums such as ''Shadows Collide With People'', he pursued the opposite: "I just wanted everything to be perfect—I didn't want anything off pitch, or off time, or any unintentional this or that."<ref name=guitarplayer2006>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.guitarplayer.com/article/exclusive-outtakes-from/Sep-06/23282|author=Cleveland, Barry|title=''Exclusive Outtakes from GP's Interview with John Frusciante!''|date=November 2006|access-date=August 27, 2007|magazine=Guitar Player|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320091008/https://www.guitarplayer.com/article/exclusive-outtakes-from/Sep-06/23282|archive-date=March 20, 2008}}</ref> Frusciante views songwriting as taking time, and does not force it: "If a song wants to come to me, I'm always ready to receive it, but I don't work at it."<ref name=selvaggio/> Much of his solo material is first written on an acoustic or unamplified electric guitar.<ref name=Acoustic>Di Perna, Alan. (April 2005). "Basic Instinct". ''Guitar World Acoustic''.</ref><ref>"Me and My Friends". ''Austin Chronicle''.</ref> He also prefers to record his albums on analog tapes and other relatively primitive equipment.<ref name=electronic>Tingen, Paul. (July 2004). "John Frusciante's Creative Explosion". ''Electronic Musician''.</ref> This preference stems from his belief that older equipment can speed up the recording process, and that modern computerized recording technology gives only an illusion of efficiency.<ref name=law1/> Frusciante tries to streamline the recording process as much as possible because he thinks "music comes alive when [you] are creating it fast". He also enjoys the challenge of having to record something in very few takes, and believes that when musicians are unable to handle the pressure of having to record something quickly they often get frustrated or bogged down by perfectionism.<ref name=electronic/> With his focus on new styles of music, Frusciante describes having worked with the computer as an instrument, and having found the ability to merge old and new production techniques. He has noted that there has been a change in how he works on an album. In the past, he would work on one song at a time, but with the new "Progressive Synth Pop" that he has been working on, he feels much more comfortable to work within the album as a whole.<ref name=RecentHistory/> He currently uses the [[music tracker]] [[Renoise]] as his main [[digital audio workstation]] along with some drum machines, sequencers, and other hardware, along with his [[Doepfer]], Arp, and other modular synthesizers.<ref name=guitarplayer2014-04>{{cite magazine|url=http://invisible-movement.net/press/2014-guitar-player|title=''John Frusciante reprograms himself, his music and Black Knights''|date=April 2014|access-date=April 4, 2014|magazine=Guitar Player|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410031244/http://invisible-movement.net/press/2014-04-guitar-player|archive-date=April 10, 2014}}</ref>

===Influences===
Frusciante's first major influence was [[Jimi Hendrix]]. He then saw [[Red Hot Chili Peppers|The Red Hot Chili Peppers]] (at that point, ''The'' was part of their name) in concert in 1985, after which their then-guitarist [[Hillel Slovak]] became his second major influence, with Frusciante coming to idolize Slovak.

He credits his inspiration for learning guitar to [[Greg Ginn]], [[Pat Smear]], and [[Joe Strummer]], amongst others.<ref name=fricke/> As an adolescent, he began by focusing upon Hendrix, as well as bands like [[Public Image Ltd.]], [[The Smiths]], and [[XTC]].<ref name="Kramer"/><ref name="tgm2002"/> Frusciante's other major influence was [[John McGeoch]] of [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]] and [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]].<ref name=Tessa /><ref>{{citation |first=Tom |last=Doyle |title=Red Hot Soloing |date=April 2004 |work=The Guitarist |issue=248 |quote=For ''By The Way''.

Frusciante explains which guitarists interest him by saying: {{quote|I like all kinds of guitar players, but it's people like the ones I just mentioned <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Matthew Ashman]] of [[Bow Wow Wow]] and [[Bernard Sumner]] of [[Joy Division]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> whose playing really amazes me, and it's because of their ideas, it's because of what they thought.

During the recording of ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'', Captain Beefheart and the acoustic, one-man blues of [[Lead Belly]] and [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]], were among the most noteworthy influences.<ref name=MOJO>Page, Scarlet (July 2004).

In describing her voice and signature sound, he said, "You can't hear [the elaborate harmonies] with your conscious; you have to hear her voice with your subconscious." He also mentioned that Brandy was the "main inspiration" behind the guitar work on Red Hot Chili Peppers' 2006 album, ''[[Stadium Arcadium]]''.<ref>{{cite web|first=Shannon|last=Zimmerman|title=John Frusciante, ''The Empyrean''|work=Spin Magazine|date=February 19, 2009|publisher=Spin.com|url=http://www.spin.com/reviews/john-frusciante-empyrean-record-collection|access-date=June 30, 2010}}</ref>

On ''Californication'' and ''By the Way'', Frusciante derived the technique of creating tonal texture through chord patterns from [[post-punk]] guitarists [[Vini Reilly]] of [[The Durutti Column]] and John McGeoch, and bands such as [[The Smiths]], [[Fugazi (band)|Fugazi]] and [[The Cure]].<ref name="tgm2002"/><ref name=MOJO/> He originally intended ''By the Way'' to be made up of "these punky, rough songs", drawing inspiration from early punk artists such as the Germs and [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]]. However, this was discouraged by producer Rick Rubin, and he instead built upon ''Californication'''s melodically-driven style.<ref>Apter, 2004. p. 329</ref> During the recording of ''Stadium Arcadium'', he moved away from his new wave influences and concentrated on emulating flashier guitar players such as Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen.<ref name=interview2006/>

Frusciante cites [[electronic music]]—in which the guitar is often completely absent—as an influence. He has used his guitar to emulate the synthesizer melodies of [[Depeche Mode]], [[The Human League]] and [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]], drawing inspiration from how those acts "were playing in a very minimal way, where every note means something new".<ref>Apter, 2004. p. 320</ref> Frusciante's other electronic influences include [[Peter Rehberg]], [[Christian Fennesz]] and [[Ekkehard Ehlers]].<ref name="Kramer"/> His interests are constantly changing, as he believes that without change he will no longer have any interest in playing: "I'm always drawing inspiration from different kinds of music and playing guitar along with records, and I go into each new album project with a preconceived idea of what styles I want to combine."<ref name=guitarplayer2006/>
