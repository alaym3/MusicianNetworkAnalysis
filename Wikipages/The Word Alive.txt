==History==

===Formation (2008–2009)===
The Word Alive was founded in 2008 by [[Craig Mabbitt]] (lead vocals) with Zack Hansen (guitar) and Tony Pizzuti (guitar) who were former members of the bands Clouds Take Shape and Calling of Syrens.<ref>{{cite web|title = Clouds Take Shape on PureVolume|url = http://www.purevolume.com/cloudstakeshape|website = PureVolume|access-date = November 2, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160401172920/http://www.purevolume.com/cloudstakeshape|archive-date = April 1, 2016|url-status = dead|df = mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.purevolume.com/callingofsyrens |title=Calling of Syrens on PureVolume |publisher=Purevolume.com |access-date=October 26, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104235257/http://www.purevolume.com/callingofsyrens# |archive-date=November 4, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> As a side-project of Mabbitt during his part in [[Escape the Fate]], the remaining required members he recruited to start The Word Alive were chosen to be Nick Urlacher (bass guitar), Dusty Riach (keyboards) and Tony Aguilera (drums). The group recorded songs with the intention of releasing them as a self-titled EP, never being officially released but leaked to P2P networks such as Soulseek. Later on, the band forced Mabbitt to leave due to their dissatisfaction with Escape the Fate's schedules, which required Mabbitt to work as a full-time member.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=61982351&blogId=452186288 |title=Featured Content on Myspace |publisher=Blogs.myspace.com |access-date=October 26, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120709155723/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=61982351&blogId=452186288 |archive-date=July 9, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The day after, Mabbitt posted a blog to his fans explaining that leaving the band was not his decision and that "[The Word Alive] pretty much replaced me while I was on the road due to the fact that they wanted to tour and couldn't until I was available, I started that band with those guys and I'm very hurt at how they replaced me while I was touring...it's bullshit." On December 3, the band officially announced that [[Tyler Smith (musician)|Tyler Smith]], who was formerly one of the vocalists for [[In Fear and Faith]] and bassist for [[Greeley Estates]], joined The Word Alive as their new vocalist.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=61982351&blogId=453597533 |title=Featured Content on Myspace |publisher=Blogs.myspace.com |access-date=October 26, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207065936/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view |archive-date=February 7, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Feeling somewhat stagnant in their progression beforehand, the addition of Smith catapulted the band's ambitions to the forefront. With this initiation, their goals and aspirations were much more a reality, and they set to work on what would become their record label debut, ''[[Empire (EP)|Empire]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fearlessrecords.com/viewband.php?band_id=44|title=Fearless Records : The Word Alive |access-date=September 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822001317/http://www.fearlessrecords.com/viewband.php?band_id=44 |archive-date=August 22, 2010 }}</ref>

===''Empire'' (2009–2010)===
During March 2009, the band were taken in with a contract by a new label,<ref>{{cite web|last=Chilton |first=Stephen |url=http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/uponsun/2009/03/the_word_alive_sign_to_fearles.php |title=The Word Alive Sign to Fearless &#124; Phoenix New Times |publisher=Blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com |date=March 30, 2009 |access-date=October 26, 2015}}</ref> later on during that month the group officially confirmed that the label they were then signed to was [[Fearless Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=963421 |title=Message |publisher=AbsolutePunk.net |access-date=October 26, 2015}}</ref> Smith stated "We hope to just keep touring, touring, touring... we couldn't be happier or more appreciative to be on tour right now, I think despite having some of the worst luck in the early beginnings of being a touring band yet never missing a show, we always have a positive attitude and that will make us a stronger band."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fearlessrecords.com/viewband.php?band_id=44|title=Fearless Records : The Word Alive |access-date=September 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822001317/http://www.fearlessrecords.com/viewband.php?band_id=44 |archive-date=August 22, 2010 }}</ref> The band set out to create an EP to be released through the label wherein it was titled ''[[Empire (EP)|Empire]]'' and was recorded with producer Andrew Wade in Ocala, Florida. It was released on July 21, 2009, where it reached No.&nbsp;15 on the ''Billboard'' Heatseeker chart.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Word Alive reveals new album information|url=http://www.hmmagazine.com/2010/07/the-word-alive-reveals-new-album-information/|publisher=[[HM (magazine)|HM]]|access-date=December 20, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402011130/http://www.hmmagazine.com/2010/07/the-word-alive-reveals-new-album-information/|archive-date=April 2, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In regards to the creation of the EP, Smith stated that The Word Alive all "feed off of each other really well, we take a little bit of everything we like and put it together to try and give the listener at least something to grasp onto when they hear a song for the first time. We consider ourselves a [[heavy metal music|metal]] band who enjoy singing a lot. As much as we love being brutal, we love being referred to as 'epic' and 'beautiful'. It works for us."<ref>[http://events.nbc13.com/birmingham-al/events/show/130508565-reaction-media-presents-bleeding-through-w-after-the-burial-for-today-the-word-alive-stray-from-the-path-and-tba] {{dead link|date=October 2015}}</ref> After the release of their EP, the band went on multiple tours with bands such as [[Alesana]], [[A Skylit Drive]] and [[Silverstein (band)|Silverstein]].<ref>[http://www.avclub.com/twincities/events/alesana-a-skylit-drive-of-mice-and-men-the-word-al,159757/]{{dead link|date=October 2015}}</ref> The Word Alive headlined with [[We Came as Romans]] on the "Dreams & Empires Tour" during the summer of 2009; from late July to mid-August. In October 2009, the band went on tour with Silverstein, [[Madina Lake]] and [[I See Stars]]. Shortly after that tour they played on the "You'd Be Way Cuter in a Coffin Tour" with Alesana on "The Emptiness Tour" which took place during early 2010. The Word Alive's single "Battle Royale" from ''Empire'' was hugely successful, leading the song to be featured in the popular ''[[Tap Tap (series)|Tap Tap]]'' series as well as it being featured as downloadable content in the ''[[Rock Band]]'' series of music games.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockband.com/songs/UGC_5001588 |title=Rock Band 4 &#124; Harmonix Music Systems, Inc |publisher=Rockband.com |access-date=October 26, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207053220/http://www.rockband.com/songs/UGC_5001588 |archive-date=February 7, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The track is also featured on the 2010 Vans Warped Tour Compilation and later went onto being credited as the group's [[signature song]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/2010-warped-tour-compilation/id374407172 |title=2010 Warped Tour CompilationVarious Artists|access-date=September 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614172230/http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/2010-warped-tour-compilation/id374407172 |archive-date=June 14, 2010 }}</ref>

During February the band reached an agreement to leave founding drummer, Tony Aguilera out of the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=14090 |title=The Word Alive kicks out drummer |publisher=Lambgoat.com |date=February 27, 2010 |access-date=October 26, 2015}}</ref> Both parties (Aguilera and the rest of the band) shared their concerns and reasoning for the matter publicly. It was overall described that the band wanted to pursue a different percussionist of alternate talent than the founding member. Aguilera was replaced with Justin Salinas, who was previously a part of the bands [[Scars of Tomorrow]] and [[Catherine (metalcore band)|Catherine]] as well as serving as a past live drummer for [[MyChildren MyBride]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://underthegunreview.net/2010/03/25/the-word-alive-announce-new-drummer/ |title=The Word Alive Announce New Drummer |publisher=Underthegunreview.net |date=March 25, 2010 |access-date=October 26, 2015}}</ref>

On March 23, 2010, a live music video for the song "The Only Rule Is That There Are No Rules" was released and includes Aguilera in its filming, making it the last release of media by the band to feature him. The video premiered on AOL's [[Noisecreep]] with a highly positive acclaim:

{{Quote|"[[metalcore|Metal-hardcore]] act the Word Alive have finally unveiled the video for 'The Only Rule Is That There Are No Rules'. 'We couldn't be happier', vocalist [Tyler Smith] told Noisecreep on the finished look of the band's first video. For the heavy driven track from the sextet's ''Empire'' EP, the obvious choice was to bring eyes and ears to their live show {{spaced ndash}} which has been getting the band quick success for only being a little over a year old. 'Our live performance has become a staple of that growth', commented Smith. Rather than having the song play over a performance at the Glasshouse in Pomona, Calif, a full effect approach was taken. 'Our director had the idea of filming the set and intertwining live audio to spice up the clip.'"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noisecreep.com/2010/03/23/the-word-alive-the-only-rule-is-that-there-are-no-rules-vi/ |title=The Word Alive, 'The Only Rule Is That There Are No Rules' – Video Premiere |publisher=Noisecreep.com |date=March 23, 2010 |access-date=October 26, 2015}}</ref>}}

In April 2010, the band entered the studio in [[Ocala, Florida|Ocala]], [[Florida]], with Andrew Wade to record their debut studio album, ''[[Deceiver (The Word Alive album)|Deceiver]]''. Frontman Tyler Smith noted that "We wanted to step it up in every aspect of our songs compared to ''Empire''. When we're heavy, it's heavier. When we do things big, they are huge! When we slow it down, it's something beautiful."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=14312 |title=The Word Alive recording new album |publisher=Lambgoat.com |date=April 12, 2010 |access-date=October 26, 2015}}</ref> After the recording process of the album was finished, the band accepted to be featured as one of the many performing acts at the [[Bamboozle Music Festival]] in New Jersey on May 1, 2010,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aolradioblog.com/2010/03/22/the-bamboozle-festival-2010-lineup/ |title=AOL Radio Stations &#124; Free Internet Radio &#124; AOL Radio |publisher=Aolradioblog.com |access-date=October 26, 2015}}</ref> and following Bamboozle, The Word Alive participated in a headlining tour with Stray from the Path for two weeks, which was also in May.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rohan Kohli |url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=1543141 |title=The Word Alive / Stray From The Path Tour – News Article |publisher=AbsolutePunk.net |access-date=October 26, 2015}}</ref>

By June, ''Deceiver'' was fully mastered and engineered.

The tracking was a lot of fun and everyone had a good time. We got the opportunity to stay in a house while we recorded and surprisingly we didn't party as much as I thought we would haha." Hansen later followed along explaining that his favorite track on the record is "[[The Hounds of Anubis]]", which was written by him and Pizzuti and stated that he "wrote this song with an '[[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] feel' to it and I think we got our point across." Smith described that its lyrics describe the times of when The Word Alive overcame their hardships that they face with the help and support from their fans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=61982351&blogId=536539663 |title=Featured Content on Myspace |publisher=Blogs.myspace.com |access-date=October 26, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207065936/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view |archive-date=February 7, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> "The Hounds of Anubis" was released as the album's second single on July 26, 2010.
