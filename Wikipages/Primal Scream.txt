'''Primal Scream''' are a Scottish [[rock music|rock]] band originally formed in 1982 in [[Glasgow]] by [[Bobby Gillespie]] (vocals) and [[Jim Beattie (musician)|Jim Beattie]]. The band's current lineup consists of Gillespie, [[Andrew Innes]] (guitar), [[Martin Duffy (musician)|Martin Duffy]] (keyboards), Simone Butler (bass), and [[Darrin Mooney]] (drums). Barrie Cadogan has toured and recorded with the band since 2006 as a replacement after the departure of guitarist [[Robert Young (musician)|Robert "Throb" Young]].

Primal Scream had been performing live from 1982 to 1984, but their career did not take off until Gillespie left his position as drummer of [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]]. The band were a key part of the mid-1980s [[indie pop]] scene, but eventually moved away from their jangly sound, taking on more [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] and [[garage rock]] influences, before incorporating a [[dance music]] element to their sound with their 1991 album ''[[Screamadelica]]'', which broke them into the mainstream. The band have continued to explore different styles on subsequent albums, experimenting with [[blues]], [[trip hop]] and [[industrial rock]]. Their most recent album, ''[[Chaosmosis]]'', was released on 18 March 2016.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1982–1984)===
Bobby Gillespie moved to [[Mount Florida]] in southeastern Glasgow, where he attended [[King's Park Secondary School]], where he first met Robert Young.<ref name="uncut">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.theprimalscream.com/press/uncut-nov99.html |title=True Adventures of Primal Scream |access-date=27 December 2007 |author=[[Michael Bonner]] |date=November 1999 |magazine=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123182728/http://www.theprimalscream.com/press/uncut-nov99.html |archive-date=23 January 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Another schoolfriend was [[Alan McGee]], who took Gillespie to his first gig, a [[Thin Lizzy]] concert.<ref name="uncut"/> McGee and Gillespie were heavily influenced by [[punk rock]], and they joined a local punk band, The Drains, in 1978. The Drains' guitarist was a 15-year-old Andrew Innes.<ref name="uncut"/> The band was short-lived, and Innes and McGee moved to London while Gillespie chose to remain in Glasgow.

After the punk movement ended, Gillespie became disenchanted with mainstream [[new wave music]].<ref name="uncut"/> He met another schoolfriend who shared his outlook, Jim Beattie, and they recorded "elemental noise tapes", in which Gillespie would bang two dustbin lids together and Beattie played fuzz-guitar.<ref name="record">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.theprimalscream.com/press/recordcollector-may94.html |title=JOHN REED LOOKS BACK OVER THE CAREER OF THE OUTSPOKEN BOBBY GILLESPIE AND HIS BAND, WHO ARE BACK WITH A CONTROVERSIAL NEW ALBUM |access-date=27 December 2007 |author=John Reed |date=May 1994 |magazine=[[Record Collector]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726103811/http://www.theprimalscream.com/press/recordcollector-may94.html |archive-date=26 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> They soon moved on to [[The Velvet Underground]] and [[The Byrds]] cover songs before starting to write their own songs, based on [[Jah Wobble]] and [[Peter Hook]] basslines. Gillespie later said that the band "didn't really exist, but we did it every night for something to do."<ref name="uncut"/> They named themselves Primal Scream, a term for a type of cry heard in [[primal therapy]]. Still essentially a partnership, Primal Scream first played live in 1982.<ref name="record"/>

===First recordings (1984–1989)===
Their first recording session, for McGee's independent label Essential Records, produced a single track entitled "The Orchard", with Judith Boyle on vocals. Beattie later claimed that they burned the master tape.<ref name="uncut"/><ref name="record"/> After the aborted recording, Gillespie joined [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]] as their drummer, and alternated between the two bands. While The Jesus and Mary Chain became notorious for their chaotic gigs, Gillespie and Beattie expanded Primal Scream's lineup to include schoolfriend Young on bass, rhythm guitarist Stuart May, drummer Tom McGurk, and tambourine player Martin St. John. This lineup was signed to [[Creation Records]], an [[independent record label]] founded by Alan McGee, and recorded the group's debut single, "All Fall Down", which received positive reviews.<ref name="uncut"/>

After the release of the single, Gillespie was told by The Jesus and Mary Chain leaders [[William Reid (musician)|William]] and [[Jim Reid]] that he was to either dissolve Primal Scream to join their band full-time or resign.<ref name="uncut"/><ref name="record"/> Gillespie chose to remain with Primal Scream. Stuart May was replaced by Paul Harte, and the group released a new single, "Crystal Crescent". Its B-side, "[[Velocity Girl (song)|Velocity Girl]]", was released on the ''[[C86]]'' compilation, which led to their being associated with the scene of the same name. The band strongly disliked this, Gillespie saying that other groups in that scene "can't play their instruments and they can't write songs."<ref name="uncut"/>

The band toured throughout 1986, and Gillespie became disenchanted with the quality of their performances. He said that there "was always something missing, musically or in attitude."<ref name="uncut"/> They switched to McGee's newly set-up [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] subsidiary [[Elevation Records]]. Before the band entered [[Rockfield Studios]] in Wales to record their debut album, McGurk was asked to leave. The group subsequently began recording using session players. They spent four weeks recording with producer [[Stephen Street]] before deciding to halt the sessions.<ref name="uncut"/>

May was subsequently dismissed; Gillespie's former bandmate Innes was brought in as his replacement, and the band found a new drummer, Gavin Skinner. With their new lineup, the band re-entered the studio, this time in London with producer [[Mayo Thompson]]. By the time ''[[Sonic Flower Groove]]'' was completed, it had cost £100,000.<ref name="uncut"/> The album reached number 62 on the British charts<ref name="uncut"/> and received poor reviews, with [[AllMusic]] calling it "pristine but dull."<ref>{{cite web|last=Raggett |first=Ned |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/sonic-flower-groove-mw0000375395 |title=Sonic Flower Groove - Primal Scream : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=17 June 2013}}</ref> The backlash from the album caused internal strife within the band. Beattie and Skinner subsequently resigned.<ref name="record"/>

The band, now consisting of Gillespie, Innes and Young, relocated to [[Brighton]] to regroup.<ref name="uncut"/> Young switched to guitar, and they recruited bassist Henry Olsen and drummer Phillip "Toby" Tomanov, who had both been in [[Nico]]'s backing band, The Faction. They traded in their [[jangle pop]] sound for a harder rock edge, or as Gillespie said, "[w]e had found rock 'n' roll."<ref name="uncut"/> The band re-signed to Creation Records and released their first single in two years, "Ivy, Ivy, Ivy". This was followed by a full album, ''[[Primal Scream (Primal Scream album)|Primal Scream]]''. The band's new sound was met with poor reviews, ''[[NME]]'' called it "confused and lacking in cohesion".<ref name="uncut"/> Fans responded as unfavourably as the critics, with many of the old fans being disappointed or simply confused by the new sound.<ref name="uncut"/> The album featured [[Felt (band)|Felt]] keyboardist [[Martin Duffy (musician)|Martin Duffy]] guesting.

===''Screamadelica'' (1990–1992)===
[[File:Primal-Scream.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Bobby Gillespie on tour in 1991 at [[Club Citta]], [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]], Japan ]]
The band were first introduced to the [[acid house]] scene by McGee in 1988. They were at first sceptical; Gillespie said: "I always remember being quite fascinated by it but not quite getting it."<ref name="uncut"/> The band developed a taste for it and began attending raves. The band met up with DJ [[Andrew Weatherall]] at a [[rave]], and he was given a copy of "I'm Losing More Than I'll Ever Have", a track from ''Primal Scream'', to remix for one of his shows.<ref name="record"/> Weatherall added a drum loop from an Italian bootleg mix of [[Edie Brickell]]'s "What I Am", a sample of Gillespie singing a line from [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]'s "[[Terraplane Blues]]" and the central introductory sample from the [[Peter Fonda]] [[B-movie]] ''[[The Wild Angels]]''. The resulting track, "[[Loaded (Primal Scream song)|Loaded]]", became the band's first major hit, reaching number 16 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="singles90">{{cite web |url=http://www.thetop40charts.co.uk/top40/ |title=Top 40 Singles: 1990 |publisher=Thetop40charts.co.uk |access-date=18 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016220614/http://www.thetop40charts.co.uk/top40/ |archive-date=16 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> This was followed by another single, "Come Together", which reached number 19.<ref name="singles90"/>

The band entered the studio with Weatherall, [[Hugo Nicolson]], [[The Orb]] and [[Jimmy Miller]] producing, and [[Martin Duffy (musician)|Martin Duffy]] now full-time on keyboards. They released two more singles, "Higher Than The Sun" and "Don't Fight It, Feel It" which featured the lead vocals of Manchester singer Denise Johnson. The album, ''Screamadelica'', was released in late 1991 to positive reviews.<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=https://allmusic.com/album/screamadelica-r15763 |title=Screamadelica - Primal Scream : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=8 October 1991 |access-date=17 June 2013}}</ref> ''Ink Blot Magazine'' said that the album was "both of its time and timeless."<ref>[http://www.inkblotmagazine.com/rev-archive/Primal_Scream_Screamadelica.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624054313/http://www.inkblotmagazine.com/rev-archive/Primal_Scream_Screamadelica.htm |date=24 June 2008 }}</ref> The album was also a commercial success, reaching number eight on the UK chart. The album won the first [[Mercury Music Prize]], beating Gillespie's former band The Jesus and Mary Chain.

The supporting tour kicked off in [[Amsterdam]], and it included a performance at the [[Glastonbury festival]] before coming to an end in [[Sheffield]]. Throughout the tour the band and their increasingly large entourage gained notoriety for their large narcotic intake.<ref name="uncut"/> Around this time, the band recorded the ''[[Dixie Narco EP]]''. Some of the tracks had a more American [[blues rock]] sound than previously, and displayed a [[P-Funk]] influence.<ref name="uncut"/>

===''Give Out But Don't Give Up'' (1992–1995)===
The band began work on their fourth album in Roundhouse Studios in London in September 1992.

In March 1994, the first single from the new album, "[[Rocks (song)|Rocks]]", was released. It was the band's highest-charting single to date, reaching number seven on the UK charts.<ref name="singles94">{{cite web |url=http://www.thetop40charts.co.uk/top40/ |title=Top 40 Singles: 1994 |publisher=Thetop40charts.co.uk |access-date=18 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016220614/http://www.thetop40charts.co.uk/top40/ |archive-date=16 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The single was not received well, with ''NME'' calling them "dance traitors".<ref name="uncut"/> The album, ''[[Give Out But Don't Give Up]]'', was released in May to mixed reviews. Whereas some praised the band's new [[The Rolling Stones]]-influenced sound,<ref>[http://www.theprimalscream.com/press/select-giveoutrev.html Give Out review]. Published in ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]''. Retrieved 31 December 2007.</ref> some dismissed the album as tired and drawing too heavily on their influences.<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/give-out-but-dont-give-up-mw0000111048 |title=Give out but Don't Give Up - Primal Scream : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=17 June 2013}}</ref> Two more singles were released from the album, "Jailbird" and "(I'm Gonna) Cry Myself Blind", both of which charted progressively lower.

While touring in support of the album, relations within the band began to wear down. The band's American tour, when they supported [[Depeche Mode]], was, in the words of manager Alex Nightingale, "the closest we've come to the band splitting up."<ref name="uncut"/> After the completion of the tour, the band remained quiet for a long period of time. Gillespie later remarked that he was unsure if the band would continue. The only release during this period was a single, "The Big Man and the Scream Team Meet the Barmy Army Uptown", a collaboration with [[Irvine Welsh]] and [[On-U Sound]], which caused controversy due to offensive lyrics about [[Rangers F.C.]] and their fan base.<ref name="uncut"/>

===''Vanishing Point'' (1996–1998)===
After a short hiatus, the band returned with a new lineup. [[Gary Mounfield|Gary "Mani" Mounfield]], fresh from the well-publicised break-up of his previous band, [[The Stone Roses]], was added as the band's new bassist, and Paul Mulraney was added as their new drummer. The arrival of Mani revitalized the group, who were considering disbanding after the failure of ''Give Out''.<ref name="NME97">{{cite web |url=http://www.theprimalscream.com/press/nme-3may97.html |title=Vortex, Drug & Rock n Roll |access-date=3 January 2008 |author=Kevin Westinberg |date=8 May 1997 |publisher=[[NME]]}}</ref> The album was recorded in the band's personal studio in two months, and was mixed in another month.<ref name="NME97"/> Most of the recording was engineered by Innes, and produced by [[Brendan Lynch (music producer)|Brendan Lynch]] and [[Andrew Weatherall]].

The music on the album had a complex shoegazing dance/dub rhythm, harking back to the crossover success of ''Screamadelica'', yet sounding significantly darker. Some songs on the album were inspired by cult 1971 film ''[[Vanishing Point (1971 film)|Vanishing Point]]''; Gillespie said that they wanted to create an alternative soundtrack for the film.<ref name="NME97"/> Other lyrics were inspired by the band's past experiences with drug abuse. Gillespie described the album as "an anarcho-syndicalist speedfreak road movie record!"<ref name="NME97"/> The first single released from the album, "[[Kowalski (song)|Kowalski]]", was released in May 1997, and reached number 8 on the British charts.<ref name="singles97">{{cite web |url=http://www.thetop40charts.co.uk/top40/ |title=Top 40 Singles: 1997 |publisher=Thetop40charts.co.uk |access-date=18 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016220614/http://www.thetop40charts.co.uk/top40/ |archive-date=16 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The album, titled ''[[Vanishing Point (Primal Scream album)|Vanishing Point]]'' after the film, was released in July and revitalized the band's commercial viability. It received almost positive reviews upon release, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' calling it a "swirling, hypnotic acid-trip",<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.theprimalscream.com/press/musik-vanishing.html |title=Vanishing Point ''Musik'' review |access-date=3 January 2008 |date=11 July 1997 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> and ''Musik'' saying that "this group's place in the history book of late 20th Century music is assured."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theprimalscream.com/press/ew.html |title=Vanishing Point review |access-date=3 January 2008 |date=August 1997 |website=Theprimalscream.com}}</ref> The inclusion on the album of [[Trainspotting (soundtrack)|the title track]] from the film ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'' also helped cement the band's place in alternative modern culture.

The band scheduled a short supporting tour to take place during July. The band had to postpone the dates. This led to speculation that there were problems within the band, and that one of the members may resign.<ref name="uncut"/> The band's press agent issued a statement saying "[i]t's not a drugs thing and it's not a nervous breakdown."<ref name="uncut"/> Before the tour was scheduled to begin, Mulraney left the band and they were forced to use a drum machine. The initial dates were poorly received, but they eventually hired drummer [[Darrin Mooney]] and the gigs improved. Throughout the Vanishing Point tour Primal Scream employed the up-and-coming [[Asian Dub Foundation]] as a support act, helping them to break into the mainstream.

In February 1998 the band released the "If They Move, Kill 'Em" EP. This notably featured the bands' first collaboration with [[Kevin Shields]], on his remix of the title track. Later that year, Shields joined the band on tour and would have a major influence on their sound in the next few years. After the release of the album, a collection of alternative mixes/remixes from Vanishing Point were released as the album Echo Dek, with the bulk of mixes done by [[Adrian Sherwood]].

===''XTRMNTR'' and ''Evil Heat'' (1999–2005)===
Recording sessions for the band's sixth album went well. The band were for the most part free of drugs, and their lineup had stabilised.<ref name="street">{{cite web |url=http://www.theprimalscream.com/press/magnet-aug00.html |title=Street Regal |access-date=19 January 2007 |author=Ferguson, Jason |publisher=Magnet Magazine }}</ref> Despite their new-found peace, the band pursued a harsher and angrier musical direction. Many of the songs they wrote had overtly political lyrics, Gillespie said the band wished to convey "What it's like to be in Britain in this day and age."<ref name="street"/> The album featured multiple guest appearances, including the [[Chemical Brothers]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s [[Bernard Sumner]], and former [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]] guitarist [[Kevin Shields]], who had become a semi-permanent member.

The first single from ''[[XTRMNTR]]'', "[[Swastika Eyes]]", was released on November 1999. The song's overtly political content, Gillespie said it was about "American international terrorism",<ref name="slut">{{cite web |url=http://www.theprimalscream.com/press/jockey-oct99.html |title=Everybody's Fucked.. |access-date=19 January 2007 |author=King, Simon |publisher=Jockey Slut }}</ref> made it controversial. Nevertheless, it was a hit, charting at No.&nbsp;22 on the British charts. ''XTRMNTR'' itself fared well, reaching No.&nbsp;3. The political content was well received, with Allmusic calling it a "nasty, fierce realization of an entire world that has... lost the plot.".<ref>{{cite web|last=Carlson |first=Dean |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/xtrmntr-mw0000260651 |title=XTRMNTR - Primal Scream : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=2 May 2000 |access-date=17 June 2013}}</ref> In 2009 ''[[NME]]'' charted ''[[XTRMNTR]]'' at No.&nbsp;3 in ''The Top 100 Greatest Albums of The Decade''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/list/the-top-100-greatest-albums-of-the-decade/158049/article/158062#article |title=The Top 100 Greatest Albums of the Decade |publisher=Nme.com |access-date=17 June 2013}}</ref>

In 2000, the band began recording their seventh album, ''[[Evil Heat]]'', released in 2002. Though the political content was not as strong as the previous album, there was a song originally slated for the album entitled "Bomb the Pentagon", which was reworked into the song "Rise" after the [[September 11 attacks|11 September attacks]].<ref name="dazed">{{cite web |url=http://www.theprimalscream.com/press/dazed-june02.html |title=Then There Was a Light |access-date=19 January 2007 |publisher=Dazed and Confused |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726103936/http://www.theprimalscream.com/press/dazed-june02.html |archive-date=26 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The album, like many of Primal Scream's previous albums, had multiple producers. Shields produced several tracks, and Andrew Weatherall produced three tracks, his first work with the band since ''Vanishing Point''. [[Kate Moss]] sang professionally for the first time with single "[[Some Velvet Morning]]", a version of the Lee Hazlewood/Nancy Sinatra song. The album also featured another guest appearance, [[Led Zeppelin]] singer [[Robert Plant]].  In 2003 the double CD album ''[[Dirty Hits]]'' was released containing the better known works and some previously unheard versions and remixes of those tunes.

In June 2005, Primal Scream played a controversial set at the [[Glastonbury Festival]], throughout which Gillespie was playfully abusive to the crowd and was alleged to have made Nazi salutes during the song "Swastika Eyes". They were eventually forced off by officials after overrunning their allotted time; the festival organisers were at that point already annoyed at the band when, in response to their invitation to join other recording artists in signing a ''Make Poverty History'' poster which would be auctioned off for charity, lead singer Bobby Gillespie instead altered the poster so that it read "Make Israel History".<ref name="Israel">{{cite web|url=http://www.theprimalscream.com/press/nme-15april06.html |title=Webadelica - A Fucking Nazi |publisher=Theprimalscream.com |date=15 April 2006 |access-date=18 July 2011}}</ref> Gillespie later said that this was to show his support for the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] cause.<ref name="Israel"/>

[[File:Primal Scream 2009.09.20 006.jpg|thumb|In 2009]]
In an interview with ''[[NME]]'', Gillespie said that the band had written "euphoric rock 'n' roll songs" for their next album.<ref name="NME Riot">[https://www.nme.com/news/primal-scream/22462 Primal Scream reveal all about new album | News | Nme.com].

The band chose [[Martin Glover|Youth]] as their producer, which led to speculation that they had fallen out with Shields. Although the band themselves admitted that they were unsure of the situation,<ref name="NME Riot"/> Shields subsequently joined them on tour.

The album's first single, "[[Country Girl (Primal Scream song)|Country Girl]]", was released on 22 May 2006, and regular airplay resulted in a chart entry of number 5, their highest ever.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thetop40charts.co.uk/top40/2006.htm |title=Top 40 Singles 2006 |publisher=Thetop40charts.co.uk |access-date=18 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930213747/http://www.thetop40charts.co.uk/top40/2006.htm |archive-date=30 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was also used by the [[BBC]] in the closing credits of the [[Grand National]] 2007 and as the backing track to a video celebrating the successes of the Scottish racing driver Dario Franchitti in the 2007 Autosport Awards ceremony in London. The album, ''[[Riot City Blues]]'', was released in June and reached number five on the [[UK Album Charts]]. However, it received mixed reviews: ''[[Pitchfork Media]]'' called it "flat and dead",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/36669-riot-city-blues |title=''Riot City Blues'' review |publisher=Pitchforkmedia.com |date=6 June 2006 |access-date=18 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225012447/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/36669-riot-city-blues |archive-date=25 December 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> while [[AllMusic]] called it "a refreshingly retro rock & roll album".<ref>{{cite web|last=Jurek |first=Thom |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/riot-city-blues-mw0000779322 |title=Riot City Blues - Primal Scream : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=22 August 2006 |access-date=17 June 2013}}</ref>

In support of the album, the band toured the UK, along with selected dates in Europe. The band released their first DVD, ''[[Riot City Blues Tour]]'', in August 2007. The DVD featured clips of the band's performance in [[London]], as well as all their music videos and an interview with Gillespie and Mani.

On 26 August 2006, bassist Mani was arrested at the Leeds music festival, after what was said to be a drunken brawl.  However, he was soon released and the band's appearance at the festival went ahead. Also around this time, Young left the band to go on sabbatical,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/primal-scream/22724 |title=Primal Scream reveal new album &#124; News |publisher=Nme.com |date=7 April 2006 |access-date=18 July 2011}}</ref> failing to appear on their November 2006 UK tour. It was later stated by Bobby Gillespie that Young was unlikely to make a return. He was temporarily replaced by Barrie Cadogan of [[Little Barrie]]. Young died in September 2014.

After touring ''Screamadelica'' for most of 2011, on 18 October [[Gary Mounfield]] revealed he had left the band due to the reformation of his original band [[The Stone Roses]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/the-stone-roses/59869 |title=The Stone Roses confirm reunion and two homecoming shows for 2012 &#124; News |publisher=Nme.com |date=18 October 2011 |access-date=23 April 2012}}</ref> [[Debbie Googe]] (of [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]]) was announced as his replacement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/primal-scream/63501 |title=Primal Scream name My Bloody Valentine's Debbie Googe as new bassist|publisher=Nme.com |date=27 April 2012}}</ref> Simone Butler would join the band as bassist in 2012.
