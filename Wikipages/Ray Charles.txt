==Early life and education==
Ray Charles Robinson was born on September 23, 1930 in [[Albany, Georgia]].<ref name=bare group=note/> he was the son of Bailey Robinson, a laborer, and Aretha (or Reatha) Robinson (nee Williams), a laundress, of [[Greenville, Florida]].

During Aretha's childhood, her mother died and her father, a man Bailey worked with, could not keep her. The Robinson family — Bailey, his wife Mary Jane and his mother — informally adopted her and Aretha took the surname Robinson. A few years later 15-year-old Aretha became pregnant by Bailey. During the ensuing scandal, she left Greenville late in the summer of 1930 to be with family in [[Albany, Georgia]]. After the birth of Ray Charles, she and her baby returned to Greenville. Aretha and Bailey's wife, who had lost a son, then shared in Charles's upbringing. His father abandoned the family, left Greenville, and married another woman elsewhere. By his first birthday Charles had a brother, George. In later years, no one could remember who George's father was.<ref name=Autobio/>

Charles was deeply devoted to his mother and later recalled, despite her poor health and adversity, her perseverance, self-sufficiency, and pride were guiding lights in his life.

In his early years, Charles showed an interest in mechanical objects and would often watch his neighbors working on their cars and farm machinery. His musical curiosity was sparked at Wylie Pitman's Red Wing Cafe, at the age of three, when Pitman played [[boogie woogie]] on an old [[upright piano]]; Pitman subsequently taught Charles how to play the piano. Charles and his mother were always welcome at the Red Wing Cafe and even lived there when they were in financial distress.<ref name=Autobio/> Pitman would also care for Ray's younger brother George, to take some of the burden off their mother. George drowned in his mother's laundry tub when he was four years old.<ref name=Autobio/><ref name="SwingMusicBio">{{cite web |last1=Parker |first1=Jeff |title=Ray Charles Biography |url=http://www.swingmusic.net/Ray_Charles_Biography.html |website=www.swingmusic.net |access-date=16 December 2018}}</ref>

Charles started to lose his sight at the age of four<ref name="NPR death">{{cite news |title=Ray Charles, American Legend, Dies at 73|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1947628 |access-date= September 25, 2014 |publisher=NPR.org |date=June 11, 2004 }}</ref> or five,<ref name="60min">Leung, Rebecca (October 14, 2004).

Despite his initial protest, Charles attended school at the [[Florida School for the Deaf and the Blind]] in [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] from 1937 to 1945.<ref name=Autobio/>

Charles further developed his musical talent at school<ref name= boheme/> and was taught to play the [[classical music|classical]] piano music of [[J.S. Bach]], [[Mozart]] and [[Beethoven]]. His teacher, Mrs. Lawrence, taught him how to use [[braille music]], a difficult process that requires learning the left hand movements by reading braille with the right hand and learning the right hand movements by reading braille with the left hand, and then combining the two parts.

Ray Charles's mother died in the spring of 1945, when he was 14. Her death came as a shock to him; he later said the deaths of his brother and mother were "the two great tragedies" of his life. Charles decided not to return to school after the funeral.<ref name=Autobio/>

==Career==
===1945–1952: Florida, Los Angeles, and Seattle===
After leaving school, Charles moved to [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] to live with Charles Wayne Powell, who had been friends with his late mother. He played the piano for bands at the [[Ritz Theatre (Jacksonville)|Ritz Theatre]] in [[LaVilla, Jacksonville, Florida|LaVilla]] for over a year,<ref>[https://thecoastal.com/culture/music/remembering-ray-charles-northeast-florida-roots Remembering Ray Charles' Northeast Florida Roots - The Coastal]</ref> earning $4 a night (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4|1952}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). He joined [[Local union|Local 632]] of the [[American Federation of Musicians|musicians' union]], in the hope that it would help him get work,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4mFoCvacGLEC&pg=PA102|page=102|title=Ray Charles|first=Norman|last=Winski|publisher=Holloway House Publishing|year= 1994|isbn=9780870677908}}</ref> and was able to use the union hall's piano, since he did not have one at home, and where he learned piano licks from copying the other players.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4mFoCvacGLEC&pg=PA104|page=104|title=Ray Charles|first=Norman|last=Winski|publisher=Holloway House Publishing|year= 1994|isbn=9780870677908}}</ref> He started to build a reputation as a talented musician in Jacksonville, but the jobs did not come fast enough for him to construct a strong identity, so, at age 16, he moved to [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], where he lived in borderline poverty and went without food for days.<ref name=Winski>{{cite book|first=Norman|last=Winski|title=Ray Charles: Singer and Musician|date=1994|publisher=Melrose Square Publishing|location=Los Angeles|isbn=0-87067-790-X|pages=[https://archive.org/details/raycharles0000wins/page/102 102–107]|url=https://archive.org/details/raycharles0000wins/page/102}}</ref> It was difficult for musicians to find work, as since [[World War II]] had ended there were no "G.I. Joes" left to entertain. Charles eventually started to write arrangements for a pop music band, and in the summer of 1947 he unsuccessfully auditioned to play piano for [[Lucky Millinder]] and his sixteen-piece band.<ref name="Lydon Riverhead">{{cite book|last=Lydon|first=Michael|year=1998|title=Ray Charles: Man and Music|url=https://archive.org/details/raycharlesmanmus00lydo|url-access=registration|publisher=Riverhead Books|isbn=1-57322-132-5}}</ref>

In 1947, Charles moved to [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], where he had two jobs, one as a pianist for Charles Brantley's Honey Dippers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabaymusichistory.com/charlie-brantley-and-his-original-honey-dippers.php |title=Charlie Brantley and His Original Honey Dippers|publisher=Tampabaymusichistory.com|access-date=2017-01-16}}</ref>

In his early career, he modeled himself on [[Nat King Cole]]. His first four recordings—"Wondering and Wondering", "Walking and Talking", "Why Did You Go?" and "I Found My Baby There"—were allegedly made in Tampa, although some discographies claim he recorded them in Miami in 1951 or Los Angeles in 1952.<ref name="Lydon Riverhead"/>

Charles had always played piano for other people, but he was keen to have his own band. He decided to leave Florida for a large city, and, considering Chicago and New York City too big, followed his friend Gossie McKee to [[Seattle]], Washington, in March 1948, knowing that the biggest radio hits came from northern cities.<ref name="Lydon Riverhead"/><ref name="boheme2">{{cite news |title=Charles, Ray (1930–2004) |publisher=HistoryLink.org|url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=5707}}</ref> Here he met and befriended, under the tutelage of [[Robert Blackwell]], a 15-year-old [[Quincy Jones]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/jon0bio-1|title=Quincy Jones Biography|publisher=Achievement.org|access-date=December 22, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926221424/http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/jon0bio-1|archive-date=September 26, 2012}}</ref>

With Charles on piano, McKee on guitar and Milton Garrett on bass, the McSon trio (named for '''''Mc'''''Kee and Robin'''''son''''') started playing the one-to-five A.M. shift at the Rocking Chair.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ray Charles: "I was Born with Music Inside Me"|first=Carin T.|last=Ford|publisher=Enslow Publishers, Inc.|year=2007|isbn=978-0766027015|url=https://archive.org/details/raycharlesiwasbo00ford/page/8}}</ref> Publicity photos of the trio are some of the earliest known photographs of Charles. In April 1949, he and his band recorded "[[Confession Blues]]", which became his first national hit, soaring to the second spot on the Billboard R&B chart.<ref name="Lydon Riverhead"/> While still working at the Rocking Chair, he also arranged songs for other artists, including [[Cole Porter]]'s "Ghost of a Chance" and [[Dizzy Gillespie]]'s "Emanon".<ref name=Winski/> After the success of his first two singles, Charles moved to Los Angeles in 1950, and spent the next few years touring with the blues musician [[Lowell Fulson]] as his musical director.<ref name="NPR death"/>

In 1950, his performance in a Miami hotel impressed [[Henry Stone]], who went on to record a Ray Charles Rockin' record (which never became particularly popular). During his stay in Miami, Charles was required to stay in the [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] but thriving black community of [[Overtown (Miami)|Overtown]]. Stone later helped [[Jerry Wexler]] find Charles in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Jacob|last=Katel|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2012-11-22/news/henry-stone-legendary-soul|title=Henry Stone: Legendary Soul |work=Miami New Times |date=November 22, 2012|access-date=February 14, 2013}}</ref>

After signing with [[Swing Time Records]], he recorded two more R&B hits under the name Ray Charles: "Baby, Let Me Hold Your Hand" (1951), which reached No. 5, and "Kissa Me Baby" (1952), which reached No. 8. Swing Time folded the following year, and [[Ahmet Ertegun]] signed him to [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]].<ref name=boheme/>

In addition to being a musician, Charles was also a record producer, producing [[Guitar Slim]]'s number 1 hit, "[[The Things That I Used to Do]]."

===1952–1959: Atlantic Records===
[[File:Aankomst Ray Charles (kop) op Schiphol, Bestanddeelnr 921-7410.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Charles in 1968]]
In June 1952, Atlantic bought Charles's contract for $2,500 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2500|1952}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-story-of-atlantic-records-20010426 |title=The Story of Atlantic Records: Ahmet Ertegun in His Own Words|last=Fricke|first=David|date=April 26, 2001 |website=Rolling Stone }}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Rockin' in Time|last=Szatmary|first=David P.|publisher=Pearson|year=2014|page=177}}</ref> His first recording session for Atlantic ("The Midnight Hour"/"Roll with My Baby") took place in September 1952, although his last Swing Time release ("Misery in My Heart"/"The Snow Is Falling") would not appear until February 1953.

In 1953, "[[Mess Around]]" became his first small hit for Atlantic; during the next year he had hits with "[[It Should've Been Me (Memphis Curtis song)|It Should've Been Me]]" and "Don't You Know".<ref name=":0"/> He also recorded the songs "Midnight Hour" and "Sinner's Prayer".

Late in 1954, Charles recorded "[[I've Got a Woman]]". The lyrics were written by bandleader Renald Richard. Charles claimed the composition. They later admitted that the song went back to the Southern Tones' "It Must Be Jesus" (1954). It became one of his most notable hits, reaching No. 2 on the R&B chart.<ref name=":0"/> "I've Got a Woman" combined gospel, jazz, and blues. In 1955, he had hits with "[[This Little Girl of Mine]]" and "[[A Fool for You]]". In upcoming years, he scored with "Drown in My Own Tears" and "Hallelujah I Love Her So". In 1959, "[[What'd I Say]]" reached No. 6 on the ''Billboard'' Pop chart and No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' R&B chart.<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":0"/>

He also recorded jazz, such as ''[[The Great Ray Charles]]'' (1957) and worked with vibraphonist [[Milt Jackson]], releasing ''[[Soul Brothers]]'' in 1958 and ''[[Soul Meeting]]'' in 1961. By 1958, he was not only headlining black venues such as the [[The Apollo Theater|Apollo Theater]] in New York, but also bigger venues such as [[Carnegie Hall]] and the [[The Newport Jazz Festival|Newport Jazz Festival]] where his first live album was recorded in 1958. He hired a female singing group, [[the Cookies]], and renamed them [[the Raelettes]]. In 1958, Charles and the Raelettes performed for the famed [[Cavalcade of Jazz]] concert produced by [[Leon Hefflin, Sr.|Leon Hefflin Sr.]] held at the [[Shrine Auditorium]] on August 3. The other headliners were [[Little Willie John]], [[Sam Cooke]], [[Ernie Freeman]], and [[Bo Rhambo]]. [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] was there to crown the winner of the Miss Cavalcade of Jazz beauty contest. The event featured the top four prominent disc jockeys of Los Angeles.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/dreamboogietrium00gura|title=Dream boogie : the triumph of Sam Cooke|last=Guralnick, Peter.|date=2005|publisher=Little, Brown|isbn=0316377945|edition=1st|location=New York|oclc=57393650}}</ref><ref>"Applause!

Charles reached the pinnacle of his success at Atlantic with the release of "[[What'd I Say]]", which combined gospel, jazz, blues and Latin music. Charles said he wrote it spontaneously while he was performing in clubs with his band. Despite some radio stations banning the song because of its sexually suggestive lyrics, the song became his first top ten pop record.<ref name="times">{{cite news |first1=Jon |last1=Pareles |first2=Bernard|last2=Weinraub|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04EEDA1530F932A25755C0A9629C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=3 |title=Ray Charles, Bluesy Essence of Soul, Is Dead at 73|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 11, 2004 |access-date=December 12, 2008}}</ref>

Later in 1959, he released his first country song (a cover of [[Hank Snow]]'s "[[I'm Moving On (Hank Snow song)|I'm Movin' On]]") and recorded three more albums for the label: a jazz record (''[[The Genius After Hours]]'', 1961); a blues record (''[[The Genius Sings the Blues]]'', 1961); and a big band record (''[[The Genius of Ray Charles]]'', 1959) which was his first Top 40 album, peaking at No. 17.<ref name=":5" />

His contract with Atlantic expired in 1959, and several big labels offered him record deals.  Choosing not to renegotiate his contract with Atlantic, he signed with [[ABC Records|ABC-Paramount]] in November 1959.<ref name=linernotes>[http://www.kalamu.com/bol/2007/08/12/ray-charles-%E2%80%9Ci-can%E2%80%99t-stop-loving-you%E2%80%9D Ray Charles, "I Can't Stop Loving You"].

Charles earned another Grammy for the follow-up "[[Hit the Road Jack]]", written by R&B singer [[Percy Mayfield]].

By late 1961, Charles had expanded his small road ensemble to a [[big band]], partly as a response to increasing royalties and touring fees, becoming one of the few black artists to cross over into mainstream pop with such a level of creative control.<ref name="times"/><ref name=cooper20>Cooper (1998), pp. 20–22.</ref> This success, however, came to a momentary halt during a concert tour in November 1961, when a police search of Charles's hotel room in Indianapolis, Indiana, led to the discovery of heroin in the medicine cabinet. The case was eventually dropped, as the search lacked a proper [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] by the police, and Charles soon returned to music.<ref name=cooper20/>

In the early 1960s, on the way from Louisiana to [[Oklahoma City]], Charles faced a near-death experience when the pilot of his plane lost visibility, as snow and his failure to use the defroster caused the windshield of the plane to become completely covered in ice. The pilot made a few circles in the air before he was finally able to see through a small part of the windshield and land the plane. Charles placed a spiritual interpretation on the event, claiming that "something or someone which instruments cannot detect" was responsible for creating the small opening in the ice on the windshield which enabled the pilot to land the plane safely.<ref name=Autobio/>

The 1962 album ''[[Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music Volume Two|Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music, Vol. 2]]'', helped to bring [[country music]] into the musical mainstream. Charles's version of the [[Don Gibson]] song "[[I Can't Stop Loving You]]" topped the Pop chart for five weeks, stayed at No. 1 on the R&B chart for ten weeks, and gave him his only number-one record in the UK. In 1962, he founded his record label, [[Tangerine Records (1963)|Tangerine]], which ABC-Paramount promoted and distributed.<ref name=Autobio/>{{rp|248}} <ref name="Lydon Riverhead"/>{{rp|213–16}} He had major pop hits in 1963 with "[[Busted (Harlan Howard song)|Busted]]" (US No. 4) and "[[Take These Chains from My Heart]]" (US No. 8).<ref>{{cite web|title=Ray Charles Chart History|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/ray-charles/chart-history|website=Billboard|access-date=March 16, 2018 }}</ref> In 1964, [[Margie Hendrix]] was kicked out of the Raelettes after a big argument.

In 1964, Charles's career was halted once more after he was arrested for a third time for possession of heroin.<ref name=":8" /> He agreed to go to rehab to avoid jail time and eventually kicked his habit at a clinic in Los Angeles. After spending a year on parole, Charles reappeared in the charts in 1966 with a series of hits composed with [[Ashford & Simpson]] and [[Jo Armstead]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/the-brill-building-broadway-and-beyond-r-b-and-soul-singer-songwriter-joshie-armstead-2495380930.html|title=The Brill Building, Broadway, and Beyond: R&B and Soul Singer-songwriter Joshie Armstead|last=Wikane|first=Christian John|date=September 11, 2017|website=PopMatters|language=en}}</ref> including the dance number "[[I Don't Need No Doctor]]" and "[[Let's Go Get Stoned (R&B song)|Let's Go Get Stoned]]", which became his first number-one R&B hit in several years. His cover version of "[[Crying Time]]", originally recorded by country singer Buck Owens, reached No. 6 on the pop chart and helped Charles win a Grammy Award the following March. In 1967, he had a top-twenty hit with another ballad, "[[Here We Go Again (Ray Charles song)|Here We Go Again]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pianofiles.com/browse/artist/ray+charles|title=Ray Charles Profile |publisher=PianoFiles.com |access-date=April 11, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504021948/http://www.pianofiles.com/browse/artist/ray+charles|archive-date=May 4, 2014}}</ref>

===1971–1983: Commercial decline===

Charles's renewed chart success, however, proved to be short lived, and by the 1970s his music was rarely played on radio stations. The rise of [[psychedelic rock]] and harder forms of rock and R&B music had reduced Charles's radio appeal, as did his choosing to record pop standards and covers of contemporary rock and soul hits, since his earnings from owning his masters had taken away the motivation to write new material. Charles nonetheless continued to have an active recording career. Most of his recordings between 1968 and 1973 evoked strong reactions: either adored or panned by fans and critics alike.<ref name="boheme"/> His recordings during this period, especially 1972's ''[[A Message from the People]]'', moved toward the [[progressive soul]] sound popular at the time.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Swenson|editor-first=John|year=1999|title=The Rolling Stone Jazz & Blues Album Guide|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=9780679768739|page=138}}</ref> ''A Message from the People'' included his unique gospel-influenced version of "[[America the Beautiful]]" and a number of protest songs about poverty and civil rights. Charles was often criticized for his version of "America the Beautiful" because it was very drastically changed from the song's original version. On July 14, 1973, [[Margie Hendrix]], the mother of Ray's son Charles Wayne Hendrix, died at 38 years old from a heroin overdose, which led to Ray caring for the child.

In 1974, Charles left ABC Records and recorded several albums on his own label, Crossover Records. A 1975 recording of Stevie Wonder's hit "[[Living for the City]]" later helped Charles win another Grammy. In 1977, he reunited with Ahmet Ertegun and re-signed to Atlantic Records, for which he recorded the album ''[[True to Life (Ray Charles album)|True to Life]]'', remaining with his old label until 1980. However, the label had now begun to focus on rock acts, and some of their prominent soul artists, such as [[Aretha Franklin]], were starting to be neglected. In November 1977 he appeared as the host of the NBC television show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/77/77e.phtml|title=Ray Charles|publisher=SnlTranscripts.jt.org|date=November 12, 1977 |access-date=September 10, 2010}}</ref>

In April 1979, his version of "Georgia on My Mind" was proclaimed the [[state song]] of Georgia, and an emotional Charles performed the song on the floor of the state legislature. In 1980 Charles performed in the musical film ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]''.<ref name="boheme"/> Although he had notably supported the [[American Civil Rights Movement]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] in the 1960s, Charles was criticized for performing at the [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]] resort in South Africa in 1981, during an international boycott protesting that country's [[apartheid]] policy. He later defended his choice of performing there after insisting that the audience of black and white fans would integrate while he was there.<ref name="boheme"/>

===1983–2004: Later years===
In 1983, Charles signed a contract with [[Columbia Records|Columbia]]. He recorded a string of country albums and had hit singles in duets with singers such as [[George Jones]], [[Chet Atkins]], [[B. J. Thomas]], [[Mickey Gilley]], [[Hank Williams Jr.]], [[Dee Dee Bridgewater]] ("Precious Thing") and his longtime friend [[Willie Nelson]], with whom he recorded "[[Seven Spanish Angels]]".

In 1985, Charles participated in the musical recording and video "[[We Are the World]]", a charity single recorded by the supergroup United Support of Artists (USA) for Africa.[[File:Ray Charles FIJM 2003.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Charles at the 2003 [[Montreal International Jazz Festival]], one of his last public performances]]

Before the release of his first album for Warner, ''Would You Believe'', Charles made a return to the R&B charts with a cover of the [[The Brothers Johnson|Brothers Johnson]]'s "[[I'll Be Good to You]]", a duet with his lifelong friend Quincy Jones and the singer [[Chaka Khan]], which hit number one on the R&B chart in 1990 and won Charles and Khan a Grammy for their duet. Prior to this, Charles returned to the pop charts with "[[Baby Grand]]", a duet with the singer [[Billy Joel]]. In 1989, he recorded a cover of the [[Southern All Stars]]' "Itoshi no Ellie" for a Japanese TV advertisement for the [[Suntory]] brand, releasing it in Japan as "Ellie My Love", where it reached No.{{nbsp}}3 on its [[Oricon]] chart.<ref name="oricon89">{{cite web|url=http://www2.wbs.ne.jp/~ms-db/oricon/oricon_single_89.htm |title=List of Best-Selling International Singles in Japan of 1989 |publisher=Oricon.

In 2001–02, Charles appeared in commercials for the [[New Jersey Lottery]] to promote its campaign "For every dream, there's a jackpot".<ref name="Zammit">{{cite web |last1=Zammit |first1=Deanna |title=N.J.

In 2003, he headlined the White House Correspondents Dinner in Washington, D.C., attended by President [[George W. Bush]], [[Laura Bush]], [[Colin Powell]] and [[Condoleezza Rice]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?176331-3/2003-white-house-correspondents-dinner-entertainment|title=2003 White House Correspondents' Dinner Entertainment|publisher=C-span.org |access-date=March 4, 2017 }}</ref>

Also in 2003, Charles presented [[Van Morrison]] with Morrison's award upon being inducted in the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]], and the two sang Morrison's song "[[Crazy Love (Van Morrison song)|Crazy Love]]" (the performance appears on Morrison's 2007 album ''[[The Best of Van Morrison Volume 3]]''). In 2003, Charles performed "Georgia on My Mind" and "America the Beautiful" at a televised annual banquet of electronic media journalists held in Washington, D.C. His final public appearance was on April 30, 2004, at the dedication of his music studio as a historic landmark in Los Angeles.<ref name="boheme" />

==Legacy==

===Influence on music industry===
Charles possessed one of the most recognizable voices in American music. In the words of musicologist [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]]:

{{blockquote|Sinatra, and Bing Crosby before him, had been masters of words. Ray Charles is a master of sounds. His records disclose an extraordinary assortment of slurs, glides, turns, shrieks, wails, breaks, shouts, screams and hollers, all wonderfully controlled, disciplined by inspired musicianship, and harnessed to ingenious subtleties of harmony, dynamics and rhythm... It is either the singing of a man whose vocabulary is inadequate to express what is in his heart and mind or of one whose feelings are too intense for satisfactory verbal or conventionally melodic articulation. He can't tell it to you. He can't even sing it to you. He has to cry out to you, or shout to you, in tones eloquent of despair—or exaltation. The voice alone, with little assistance from the text or the notated music, conveys the message.<ref>{{cite book|first= Henry|last= Pleasants|author-link= Henry Pleasants (music critic)|date= 1974|title= The Great American Popular Singers|publisher= Simon and Schuster|location= New York City|isbn= 9780671216818|url= https://archive.org/details/greatamericanpop00pleas}}</ref>}}[[File:Ronald Reagan, Nancy Reagan, and Ray Charles.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Charles with President [[Ronald Reagan]] and First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]], 1984]]

Pleasants continues, "Ray Charles is usually described as a baritone, and his speaking voice would suggest as much, as would the difficulty he experiences in reaching and sustaining the baritone's high E and F in a popular ballad. But the voice undergoes some sort of transfiguration under stress, and in music of gospel or blues character he can and does sing for measures on end in the high tenor range of A, B flat, B, C and even C sharp and D, sometimes in full voice, sometimes in an ecstatic head voice, sometimes in falsetto. In falsetto he continues up to E and F above high C. On one extraordinary record, 'I'm Going Down to the River'...he hits an incredible B flat...giving him an overall range, including the falsetto extension, of at least three octaves."

His style and success in the genres of rhythm and blues and jazz had an influence on a number of highly successful artists, including, as Jon Pareles has noted, [[Elvis Presley]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Van Morrison]], and [[Billy Joel]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Pareles|first=Jon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/10/arts/music/ray-charles-who-reshaped-american-music-dies-at-73.html |title= Ray Charles, Who Reshaped American Music, Dies at 73|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 23, 2018}}</ref> Other singers who have acknowledged Charles's influence on their own styles include [[James Booker]],<ref name="russell">{{cite book| first= Tony| last= Russell| date= 1997| title= The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray| publisher=Carlton Books | location= Dubai| page= 94| isbn= 1-85868-255-X}}</ref> [[Steve Winwood]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Buckley |first=Michael |url=https://www.stevewinwood.com/news/6062 |title= A Chat With Steve Winwood: June 10, 2005 |publisher=The Annapolis Capital |access-date=September 23, 2018}}</ref> [[Richard Manuel]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Viney |first=Peter |url=http://theband.hiof.no/articles/viney_ray_charles_band.html|title= Influences on The Band: Ray Charles|publisher=theband.hiof.no |access-date=September 23, 2018}}</ref> and [[Gregg Allman]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Lynskey|first=John|url=https://www.greggallman.com/music/back-to-macon/|title= Gregg Allman Live: Back to Macon|date=5 December 2016|publisher=greggallman.com |access-date=September 23, 2018 }}</ref> According to Joe Levy, a music editor for ''Rolling Stone'', "The hit records he made for Atlantic in the mid-1950s mapped out everything that would happen to rock 'n' roll and soul music in the years that followed".<ref name="times" /> Charles was also an inspiration to [[Pink Floyd]] member [[Roger Waters]], who told the Turkish newspaper ''[[Hurriyet]]'': "I was about 15. In the middle of the night with friends, we were listening to jazz. It was "[[Georgia on My Mind]]", Ray Charles's version. Then I thought 'One day, if I make some people feel only one-twentieth of what I am feeling now, it will be quite enough for me.'"<ref>{{cite news|last=Oskay|first=Cinar|url=http://kelebekgaleri.hurriyet.com.tr/galeridetay/71812/2368/23/roger-waters-cinar-oskay-roportaji |title= Roger Waters, Cinar Oskay roportaji: 'Muziginizin hatirlanmasi sizin icin onemli mi?'|language=tr|newspaper=[[Hurriyet]]|access-date=August 4, 2013}}</ref>

''[[Ray (film)|Ray]]'', a biopic portraying his life and career between the mid-1930s and 1979, was released in October 2004, starring [[Jamie Foxx]] as Charles. Foxx won the [[77th Academy Awards|2005]] [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for the role.

On March 15, 1961, shortly after the release of the hit song "Georgia on My Mind" (1960), the [[Albany, Georgia]]-born musician was scheduled to perform at a dance at Bell Auditorium in [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]], but cancelled the show after learning from students of [[Paine College]] that the larger auditorium dance floor would be restricted to whites, while blacks would be obligated to sit in the Music Hall balcony. Charles left town immediately after letting the public know why he wouldn't be performing, but the promoter went on to sue Charles for breach of contract, and Charles was fined $757 in Fulton County Superior Court in Atlanta on June 14, 1962.

Ray Charles was among hundreds of artists whose material was destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=28 June 2019 |date=25 June 2019}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Charles stated in his 1978 autobiography, ''Brother Ray: Ray Charles' Own Story'', that he became hooked on women after losing his virginity at 12 years old to a woman about 20. "Cigarettes and smack [heroin] are the two truly addictive habits I've known. You might add women," he said. "My obsession centers on women—did then [when young] and does now. I can't leave them alone," he added.<ref name=":7">{{Cite magazine|date=November 30, 1978|title=Ray Charles' Own Book Reveals He|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fr8DAAAAMBAJ&q=ray+charles&pg=PA24|magazine=Jet|volume= 55| issue =  11|pages=22–24, 60–62}}</ref>

=== Relationships and children ===
Charles was married twice. His first marriage was less than a year, his second 22 years. Throughout his life Charles had many relationships with women with whom he fathered a dozen children.

His marriage to Eileen Williams lasted from July 31, 1951, until 1952.

He met his second wife Della Beatrice Howard Robinson (called "Bea" by Charles) in Texas in 1954. They married the following year on April 5, 1955. Their first child together, Ray Charles Robinson Jr., was born in 1955. Charles was not in town for the birth because he was playing a show in Texas. The couple had two more sons, David and Robert. They raised their children in [[View Park–Windsor Hills, California|View Park, California]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Louie|date=October 1974|title=The Enduring Genius of Ray Charles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JN4DAAAAMBAJ&q=view+park&pg=PA125|journal=Ebony|pages=132}}</ref> Charles felt that his heroin addiction took a toll on Della during their marriage.<ref name="Autobio" /> Due to his drug addiction, extramarital affairs on tours and volatile behavior, the marriage deteriorated and they divorced after 22 years of marriage in 1977.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.newswirl.com/della-beatrice-howard-robinson/|title=Della Beatrice Howard Robinson|date=December 30, 2017|website=NewSwirl|language=en-US}}</ref>

Charles had a six-year-long affair with [[Margie Hendrix]], one of the original Raelettes, and in 1959 they had a son, Charles Wayne. His affair with Mae Mosley Lyles resulted in another daughter, Renee, born in 1961. In 1963, by Sandra Jean Betts, Ray Charles had a daughter, Sheila Raye Charles, a singer and songwriter who died of breast cancer on June 15, 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.einpresswire.com/article/387087694/the-daughter-of-music-icon-ray-charles-sheila-raye-charles-succumbs-to-breast-cancer |title=The daughter of Music Icon Ray Charles; Sheila Raye Charles succumbs to breast cancer |website=Einpresswire.com |date=2017-06-15 |access-date=2017-06-25}}</ref> In 1977, Charles had a child with his Parisian lover Arlette Kotchounian whom he met in 1967.<ref name=":3">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5v1pSAHAEa0C&pg=PP1|title=Ray Charles: Birth of Soul|last=Evans|first=Mike|date=2009|publisher=Omnibus|isbn=9780857120519|location=London}}</ref> His long-term girlfriend and partner at the time of his death was Norma Pinella.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RSGhEUq5bp0C&q=norma+pinella+ray+charles&pg=PA176|title=Icons of Black America: Breaking Barriers and Crossing Boundaries [3 volumes]: Breaking Barriers and Crossing Boundaries [Three Volumes]|last=Whitaker|first=Matthew |publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2011|isbn=9780313376436|language=en}}</ref>

Charles held a family luncheon for his twelve children in 2002, ten of whom attended. He told them he was mortally ill and $500,000 had been placed in trusts for each of the children to be paid out over the next five years.<ref name=":5" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Ray Charles' children battle over his legacy|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-raycharles20apr20-story.html|date=2008-04-20|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-06-02}}</ref>

===Drug abuse and legal problems===
At 18, Charles first tried [[marijuana]] when he played in McSon Trio and was eager to try it as he thought it helped musicians create music and tap into their [[creativity]]. He later became addicted to [[heroin]] for seventeen years.<ref name=":7" /> Charles was first arrested in 1955, when he and his bandmates were caught backstage with loose marijuana and drug paraphernalia, including a burnt spoon, syringe, and needle. The arrest did not deter his drug use, which only escalated as he became more successful and made more money.<ref name="Lydon Riverhead" />

In 1958, Charles was arrested on a [[Harlem]] street corner for possession of narcotics and equipment for administering heroin.<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=December 4, 1958|title=Singer Ray Charles Jailed on Dope Charge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f0EDAAAAMBAJ&q=ray+charles+arrested+jet+1958&pg=PA57|magazine=Jet|volume= 15| issue =  5|pages=57}}</ref>

Charles was arrested on a [[narcotics]] charge on November 14, 1961, while waiting in an Indiana hotel room before a performance. The detectives seized heroin, marijuana, and other items.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=November 30, 1961|title=Ray Charles Nabbed On Dope Charge, Wants To 'Take Cure'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KLMDAAAAMBAJ&q=ray+charles+arrested+jet+1961&pg=PA58|journal=Jet|pages=58–59}}</ref> Charles, then 31, said he had been a drug addict since the age of 16. The case was dismissed because of the manner in which the evidence was obtained,<ref name="pc16">{{cite web |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19765/m1|title=Show 16 – The Soul Reformation |website=unt.edu|publisher=[[University of North Texas]] |access-date=September 18, 2010}}</ref> but Charles's situation did not improve until a few years later.

On [[Halloween]] 1964, Charles was arrested for possession of heroin at [[Boston|Boston's]] [[Logan Airport]].<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|url=https://www.superlawyers.com/massachusetts/article/saving-ray-charles/fe67801d-057d-4b2a-8f71-eb083e313f91.html|title=Saving Ray Charles - Super Lawyers Massachusetts|last=Bordowitz|first=Hank|date=August 24, 2015|website=Super Lawyers|language=en|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref> He decided to quit heroin and entered St. Francis Hospital in [[Lynwood, California]], where he endured four days of [[cold turkey]] withdrawal. Following his self-imposed stay, he pleaded guilty to four narcotic charges. Prosecutors called for two years in prison and a hefty fine, but the judge listened to Dr. Hacker's account of Charles's determination to get off drugs and he was sent to [[McLean Hospital]] in [[Belmont, Massachusetts]].<ref name="McLean">{{cite news|url=https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-xpm-2002-01-06-0201060272-story.html|title=More than Just a Celebrity Psych Ward|last1=Turner|first1=M.A.|date=January 6, 2002|newspaper=Hartford Courant|access-date=3 February 2019}}</ref> The judge offered to postpone the verdict for a year if Charles agreed to undergo regular examinations by government-appointed physicians. When Charles returned to court, he received a five-year [[suspended sentence]], four years of probation, and a fine of $10,000.<ref name=":2" />

Charles responded to the saga of his drug use and reform with the songs "[[I Don't Need No Doctor]]" and "Let's Go Get Stoned" and the release of ''Crying Time'', his first album since kicking his heroin addiction in 1966.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blackdoctor.org/272450/ray-charles-drug-addiction__trashed/ |title= Ray Charles: Lessons From His Life & Death | website= BlackDoctor.org |access-date= March 16, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/ray-charles-about-ray-charles/554/|title= About Ray Charles |website= PBS.org| date=May 17, 2006|access-date= March 16, 2017}}</ref>

===Chess hobby===
Charles enjoyed playing chess. As part of his therapy when he quit heroin, he met with psychiatrist {{ill|Friedrich Hacker|de}}, who taught him how to play chess, three times a week.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=chj91X0dWzUC&q=heroin+ray+charles+1966&pg=PA44|title=Icons of Rock: An Encyclopedia of the Legends Who Changed Music Forever|last1=Schinder|first1=Scott|last2=Schwartz|first2=Andy|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2007|isbn=9780313338458|pages=44|language=en}}</ref> He used a special board with raised squares and holes for the pieces.

==Death==
In 2003, Charles had successful hip replacement surgery and was planning to go back on tour, until he began suffering from other ailments.

The episode "School's Out: The Musical" from [[The Fairly OddParents]] was dedicated to his memory.

==Discography==
{{main|Ray Charles discography}}

Charles' discography is highly complex and extensive. [[AllMusic]] has listed approximately 60 original albums and more than 200 compilation albums, while music essayist [[Robert Christgau]] noted the existence of more. At least 20 record labels have released near-identical compilations of Charles' pre-[[Atlantic Records]] tracks, while many of the [[mastering (audio)|masters]] that Charles began to own after 1960 were not digitally reissued, leading the Atlantic sister label [[Rhino Entertainment]] to focus on rereleasing his mid-to-late 1950s music. Christgau has called Charles' discography a "monumental mess" and that "any map of his oeuvre must be personal and provisional".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=July 8, 2004|title=The Genius at Work: Ray Charles, A Critical Discography|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=July 24, 2021|via=robertchristgau.com|url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/music/charles-rs.php}}</ref>
