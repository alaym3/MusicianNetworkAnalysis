At the age of 14, Kher left home in search of a [[music teacher|guru]] or an institution to further his musical training, and he embarked on years of classical and folk music study.

I had asked Mehboob, our lyricist, for a new voice that is earthy and strong, and he said, I have just the person for you. That voice can only be that of Kailash! And he sent Kailash to meet me. The moment I heard him, I knew that here was a voice that was so wonderful, and which had its own unique space.... I want to say that Kailash Kher's voice has something that had been lacking a lot – it had pure soul!  Allah Ke Bande is one of my all time favorite songs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rehman launches Kailash Kher's debut album |url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/hindi/article/20903.html}}</ref></blockquote>
