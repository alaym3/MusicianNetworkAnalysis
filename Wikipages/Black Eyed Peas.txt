'''Black Eyed Peas''' (also known as '''The Black Eyed Peas''') is an American musical group consisting of rappers [[will.i.am]], [[apl.de.ap]],  [[Taboo (rapper)|Taboo]] and J. Rey Soul.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/9405236/black-eyed-peas-interview-translation-album|title=THE BLACK EYED PEAS WANT TO PROVE THEMSELVES AGAIN— WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM SOME LATIN STARS|magazine=Billboard|author=Leila Cobo|date=June 19, 2020|access-date=August 19, 2020}}</ref><!-- Consult talk page before altering member status --> Originally an [[alternative hip hop]] group, they subsequently refashioned themselves as a more marketable [[pop-rap]] act.<ref name="Endelman"/> Although the group was founded in Los Angeles in 1995, it was not until the release of their third album, ''[[Elephunk]]'', in 2003, that they achieved high record sales. 

Black Eyed Peas' first major hit was the 2003 single "[[Where Is the Love?]]" from ''Elephunk'', which topped the charts in 13 countries, including the United Kingdom, where it spent seven weeks at number one and went on to become Britain's biggest-selling single of 2003. Their fourth album, ''[[Monkey Business (The Black Eyed Peas album)|Monkey Business]]'', was an even bigger worldwide success, and became certified [[RIAA certification|3× Platinum]] in the United States. In 2009, the group became one of only 11 artists to have simultaneously held the number-one and number-two spots on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], with their singles "[[Boom Boom Pow]]" and "[[I Gotta Feeling]]", which topped the chart for an unprecedented 26 consecutive weeks.

The album ''[[The E.N.D.]]'' produced a third Hot 100 number-one placement with "[[Imma Be]]", making the group one of few to ever place three number one singles on the chart from the same album, before being followed with "[[Rock That Body]]" and "[[Meet Me Halfway]]", which peaked in the top 10 of the Hot 100. "I Gotta Feeling" became the first single to sell more than one million downloads in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/music/newsid_10340000/newsid_10340800/10340829.stm |work=BBC News|title=Black Eyed Peas set downloads record | date=June 21, 2010}}</ref> At the [[52nd Grammy Awards]] ceremony, held in January 2010, they won three awards out of six nominations. In November 2010, they released the album ''[[The Beginning (The Black Eyed Peas album)|The Beginning]]''. In February 2011, the group performed in the [[Super Bowl XLV halftime show]].

Black Eyed Peas have sold an estimated 80 million records, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling groups of all time]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.romania-insider.com/black-eyed-peas-2018-untold|title=Black Eyed Peas to perform at Romania's 2018 Untold festival|date=June 26, 2018|work=Romania-Insider.com|access-date=June 20, 2019}}</ref> They were ranked 12th on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s 2000s Decade-End Artist of the Decade Chart, and 7th on the Hot 100 Artists of the Decade.

==History==
===1995–2001: ''Behind the Front'' and ''Bridging the Gap''===
In 1995 will.i.am and apl.de.ap – former members of [[Atban Klann]] – formed a new group named as Black Eyed Pods (after renamed as The Black Eyed Peas) with Jaime Gomez ([[Taboo (rapper)|Taboo]]), and [[Kim Hill (soul musician)|Kim Hill]], a singer who featured on a selected number of their tracks.<ref name="allmusic page">{{cite web|last=Kellman|first=Andy|title=The Black Eyed Peas|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-black-eyed-peas-p302855/biography|publisher=Allmusic|access-date=January 4, 2011}}</ref> Unlike the "[[gangsta rap]]" sounds of Los Angeles-based hip hop acts at the time, the trio performed with a live band and adopted a conscious musical and appearance style. After being signed to [[Interscope Records]] and releasing their debut, ''[[Behind the Front]]'' (1998) the group (and their accompanying live band) earned critical acclaim. One of the singles from the album was "[[Joints & Jam]]", and was featured on the ''[[Bulworth]]'' soundtrack. Singer [[Sierra Swan]] appeared as a guest on the 1998 song "Fallin' Up". Their second album, ''[[Bridging the Gap (Black Eyed Peas album)|Bridging the Gap]]'' (2000), produced the singles "[[Weekends (Black Eyed Peas song)|Weekends]]" featuring [[Esthero]] and "[[Request + Line]]" featuring [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] singer [[Macy Gray]]. Hill left the band while producing the album, but was still featured on the album tracks for "Hot" and "Tell Your Mama Come" as well as in the video for "Weekends".

===2002–2005: Addition of Fergie and ''Elephunk''===
[[File:Black Eyed Peas 2.jpg|thumb|right|The Black Eyed Peas signing autographs in 2004]]
In 2002, [[Nicole Scherzinger]] auditioned for singer but [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]] was chosen, introduced to will.i.am by Dante Santiago. Fergie joined the group in 2002. ''Elephunk'' is also the first album that indicated and demonstrated the new, polished pop sound designed to attract mass audiences. In a positive review of the Black Eyed Peas' new-found style, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' noted that since 2002, when the group "hired a blond bombshell named Stacy 'Fergie' Ferguson and gave up their pursuit of backpack-rapper cred, they have made a kind of spiritual practice of recording futuristic songs – a total aesthetic commitment that extends from their garish wardrobes to their [[Benetton Group|United Colors of Benetton]] worldview."<ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/28503103/review/28565349/the_end_the_energy_never_dies | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090612091703/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/28503103/review/28565349/the_end_the_energy_never_dies | url-status =dead | archive-date =June 12, 2009 |title=The E.N.D (The Energy Never Dies) |work=Rolling Stone |date=June 8, 2009}}</ref>

From ''[[Elephunk]]'' came "[[Where Is the Love?]]", which became the Black Eyed Peas' first major hit, peaking at No. 8 on the U.S. Hot 100. It was more successful abroad, topping the charts in several other countries, including seven weeks at No. 1 in the United Kingdom, where it became the [[List of best-selling singles by year (UK)|biggest-selling single]] of 2003. The single had similar results in Australia, staying at No. 1 for six weeks. In an interview with TalkofFame.com, Taboo shared that [[Justin Timberlake]]'s split with [[Britney Spears]] impacted the recording of "Where Is the Love?".<ref>{{Citation|last=Albert Lawrence|title=Taboo of the Black Eyed Peas Talks Justin Timberlake Rap Session & Boom Boom Pow|date=May 6, 2009|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dpee5Y1eAP0|access-date=July 18, 2018}}</ref> The album subsequently spawned "[[Shut Up (The Black Eyed Peas song)|Shut Up]]", which peaked at No. 2 in the UK and topped the charts and went [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] and platinum in the U.S., UK, Germany, and other European markets. The third single from the album, although significantly restyled from the original ''Elephunk'' version, "[[Hey Mama (The Black Eyed Peas song)|Hey Mama]]" hit the top 5 in Australia and the top 10 in the UK, Germany and other European countries and reached No. 23 in the U.S. The song received even more exposure in 2003 when it was featured in the first "silhouette" television commercial for the [[iPod]]. The fourth single from the album was "[[Let's Get It Started]]". It won a 2005 Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group and also received two nominations for Record of the Year and Best Rap Song. In 2004, the Black Eyed Peas embarked on their international Elephunk Tour, touring many countries in Europe, Africa, and Asia.

===2004–2008: ''Monkey Business''===
[[File:Black Eyed Peas.jpg|thumb|right|The Black Eyed Peas' apl.de.ap and Fergie in 2005]]
Their fourth album, ''[[Monkey Business (The Black Eyed Peas album)|Monkey Business]]'', was recorded through 2004 and was released on June 7, 2005. Much of the pre-production writing was performed on the [[John Lennon Educational Tour Bus]] while on the Black Eyed Peas tour of 2004. The album's first single, "[[Don't Phunk with My Heart]]", was a hit in the U.S., reaching number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. This ''Billboard'' status was the highest peak yet of their career in the U.S. (this was later broken when "[[Boom Boom Pow]]" peaked at the top spot of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100) and earned them another Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group|Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]]. The song reached three in the UK, and five in Canada, and stayed at number one for three weeks in Australia. Some radio stations, concerned about complaints of obscenity, played an alternative version, "Don't Mess with My Heart". "[[Don't Lie]]", the second single from the album, saw success on the U.S. Hot 100, reaching No. 14, although becoming somewhat more successful in the UK and Australia, reaching a peak of No. 6 in both countries. "[[My Humps]]", another song from the album, immediately achieved commercial success in the U.S. and also garnered fairly substantial radio play despite the sexually suggestive lyrics. It reached number three on the U.S. Hot 100 and number one in Australia, making it their fourth Australian number one single. However, many mocked the song for its poor lyrical content. For instance, John Bush, writing for [[AllMusic]], described it as "one of the most embarrassing rap performances of the new millennium".<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r740971|pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic.com}}</ref> Despite this, the album ''Monkey Business'' debuted at number two on the [[Billboard 200|U.S. ''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart, selling over 295,000 copies in its first week and was later [[RIAA certification|certified]] 3× platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. Their next and final commercially released single from the album was "[[Pump It]]", which borrows much of its sound from "[[Misirlou]]", specifically [[Dick Dale]]'s version. The track peaked at number 8 in Australia and number 18 in the U.S.

In September 2005, the Black Eyed Peas released an ''[[iTunes Originals]]'' playlist of their greatest hits, as well as some that were re-recorded specially available for purchase through iTunes. The playlist includes popular songs such as "[[Don't Lie]]", "[[Shut Up (The Black Eyed Peas song)|Shut Up]]", and a new version of "[[Where Is the Love?]]". It has small stories containing info and commentary about the songs and how the group first met. In autumn 2005, the Black Eyed Peas set off to tour with [[Gwen Stefani]] as supporting act. In December 2005, they embarked on the "European Tour", which toured multiple countries in Europe. The European leg which opened in [[Tel Aviv]], Israel, continued onto Ireland, the UK, France and Germany.

They again brought the John Lennon Educational Tour Bus on the tour with them to craft new songs for [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]]'s solo debut album. In 2006, they went on tour with the Pussycat Dolls.<ref>{{cite web |title=Black Eyed Peas and Pussycat Dolls in Concert |url=http://top40.about.com/od/concertreviews/fr/beppcdconc.htm |first=Billy |last=Lamb |work=[[About.com]] |date=May 6, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213052029/http://top40.about.com/od/concertreviews/fr/beppcdconc.htm |archive-date=December 13, 2009  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.HondaCivicTour.com |title=HondaCivicTour.com |access-date=April 27, 2007}}</ref>

Following its release, will.i.am remarked that the album had been inspired by a trip to Australia, specifically the sound of [[The Presets]]' "[[My People (The Presets song)|My People]]". "The energy on the Presets' small little stage was crazy energy. That song My People – that shit is wild," will.i.am said, "That's the reason why this record sounds the way it does – my three months in Australia."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,25719032-5018684,00.html|author=Adelaide Now|title=Peas Step Out Of Pod|date=July 1, 2009 | work=The Advertiser}}</ref> In its first week, the album sold 304,000 copies and debuted at number 1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].
