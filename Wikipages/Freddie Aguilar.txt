==Career==
Freddie Aguilar first began performing in public in 1973, when he auditioned and was hired to play folk songs at {{Philippine peso|50}} per gig at the Hobbit House in [[Ermita]], [[Manila]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Freddie Aguilar and his enduring 'Hobbit'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=8cBNEdFwSQkC&dat=19890629&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|access-date=June 22, 2021|work=[[Manila Standard]]|publisher=Kagitingan Publications, Inc.|date=June 29, 1989|page=26}}</ref>

===International acclaim===
Aguilar's "[[Anak]]" not only broke the Philippine record charts in 1979, but it also hit the no. 1 spot in Japan and achieved considerable popularity in other countries as [[Angola]], [[Japan]], [[Malaysia]], [[Hong Kong]], and parts of Western Europe.<ref name="c"/>
The song has become so famous that, by some counts, it has been recorded in as many as a hundred versions in 23 languages throughout the world.<ref>{{Citation|last=Caruncho|first=Eric S.|title=Eric S. Caruncho}}</ref> ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' reported that the song was the number two world hit of the 1980s.

Even before Aguilar's rendition of "Bayan Ko," Aguilar created and performed songs targeted at social injustices. His album, ''Magdaleno'' included songs about a girl forced into prostitution as a result of poverty and the Christian-Muslim clashes in his song ''Mindanao.'' After the album, Freddie Aguilar also sang about the injustices suffered by the powerless, poverty, and the arrogance of superpowers in a song about the U.S. and Russia.<ref name="e"/>

Five years after the composition of "Anak", Freddie Aguilar joined protests against the Marcos regime and began writing and performing songs that criticized the excesses of the government.<ref name="c">{{cite journal |last1=Tadiar |first1=Neferti X.

One of the songs he was most remembered for during that time was his interpretation of "[[Bayan Ko]]" ("''My Country''"), in which he added a verse to the original piece.<ref>{{Citation|last=Poblete|first=Johanna D.|title=Songs of Freedom|newspaper=Weekender|pages=S4/1|date=August 7, 2009}}</ref>

In 1978, Aguilar first recorded "Bayan Ko" in a patriotic effort to, in his words, "jolt back those who were starting to forget who we really are."<ref name="c"/> He also provided a rendition of the song as it is inspiring and gave him excitement and a surge of power.<ref name="f">{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/lifestyle/06/24/10/bayan-ko-has-long-history|title='Bayan Ko' has a long history|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|date=June 24, 2010|website=ABS-CBN News}}</ref> The song was originally composed in 1928 by Constancio de Guzman, with lyrics by poet [[Jose Corazon de Jesus]], during a time of struggle for Philippine independence from US occupation.<ref name="d">{{cite journal |last1=Maceda |first1=Teresita Gemenez |year=2007 |title=Problematizing the popular: the dynamics of Pinoy pop(ular) music and popular protest music |journal=Inter-Asia Cultural Studies |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=390–413 |doi=10.1080/14649370701393766 |s2cid=143833840 }}</ref> It emerged once again during the Marcos regime as the unofficial anthem of the emergent "people" of the "People Power", the new democratic nation opposed to authoritarianism that is widely credited with the deposing of [[Ferdinand Marcos]].<ref name="c"/> In 1983, the assassination of [[Benigno Aquino Jr.|Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino]] triggered massive demonstrations against the Marcos dictatorship, and Aguilar's rendition of "Bayan Ko" was blared on the radio and speakers mounted on jeepneys throughout the streets of Manila and the provinces of the Philippines.<ref name="d"/> At the funeral of Senator Aquino, Freddie Aguilar sang "Bayan Ko" and felt that Aquino was a man of action who even gave his life for the freedom of the Philippines.<ref name="g">[https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2014/02/25/dancing-to-the-tune-of-the-revolution/, Dancing to the Tune of the Revolution: 5 songs of EDSA]</ref> During the performance, Freddie Aguilar did not feel scared anymore and felt strong and confident.<ref name="f"/> He then decided to join the cause as well.<ref name="g"/> Aguilar, along with [[APO Hiking Society]] and other Pinoy pop musicians who took a stand against dictatorship, joined other protest singers in music and street performances as part of the anti-Marcos rallies.<ref name="d"/>

A few years later, Aguilar campaigned for the presidential candidacy of [[Corazon Aquino]] in the national election that would lead to the 1986 revolt.<ref name="c"/>
