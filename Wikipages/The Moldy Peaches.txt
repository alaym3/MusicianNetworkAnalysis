'''The Moldy Peaches''' were an American [[independent music|indie group]] founded by [[Adam Green (musician)|Adam Green]] and [[Kimya Dawson]]. Leading proponents of the [[anti-folk]] scene, the band has been on [[Recess (break)|hiatus]] since 2004. The appearance of their song "[[Anyone Else but You]]" in the film ''[[juno (film)|Juno]]'' significantly raised their profile; Dawson and Green made a handful of reunion appearances together in December 2007.

==History==
Green and Dawson met at Exile on Main Street Records in [[Mount Kisco, New York]] and began working together.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beggarsgroupusa.com/themoldypeaches/biography/ |title=the Moldy Peaches |access-date=2008-02-13 |work=biography |publisher=[[Beggars Group]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511194506/http://www.beggarsgroupusa.com/themoldypeaches/biography/ |archive-date=2008-05-11 }}</ref> Green put out a 7" Ep called "X-Ray Vision" under the name The Moldy Peaches, featuring recordings he made from 1994–96 with Dawson and various other friends, notably Jules Sheridan, a songwriter based in Scotland. Green and Dawson recorded a CDR album in 1998 under the name Moldy Peaches 2000 called ''FER THE KIDS'' before Dawson moved to [[Port Townsend, Washington]].<ref name="crud">{{cite web| url=http://www.2-4-7-music.com/newsitems/aug01/moldypeaches.asp | title=Moldy Peaches Interview – Anti-Folk For Dummies. | publisher=CRUD Magazine |date=2001-10-15|access-date=2008-02-12}}</ref> In early 1999 Green joined her there, and more home and live recordings transpired. The band returned to NYC as a 4 piece later in the year (including Jest Commons, guitar, and Justin Campbell, drums). They became active on the NYC [[anti-folk]] scene, playing at the [[SideWalk Cafe]] before the band broke up.<ref name="crud" /> Dawson and Green both recorded solo albums. The band reformed in August 2000 with [[Chris Barron]] of the [[Spin Doctors]] on lead guitar, Brian Piltin on bass guitar, and Strictly Beats (Brent Cole) on drums.<ref name="crud" />  (The "2000" was dropped from their name around this time). A new 11 song album was recorded, which led to a deal with [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]] in the UK.<ref name="crud" /> They gained recognition after their initial 7" 'Who's Got the Crack" was named 'Single of the Week' in ''[[NME]]''. Rough Trade released the album ''[[The Moldy Peaches (album)|The Moldy Peaches]]'' in 2001. Released in the U.S. on September 11, 2001, it contained the song "NYC Is Like a Graveyard". The band expanded to a six-piece, with guitarists [[Jack Dishel]] and Aaron Wilkinson, bass player Steven Mertens, and drummer Strictly Beats, augmenting the original duo of Dawson and Green. They toured internationally with [[The Strokes]] with whom they shared record label and management.

Aaron Wilkinson left the band and was replaced by [[Toby Goodshank]]. Wilkinson died from an [[overdose]] in July 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adamgreen.net/news_archive3.html |title=Adam Green |access-date=2008-01-28 |quote=Aaron Wilkinson—Adam's friend who died last July from an overdose |work=news |publisher=adamgreen.net |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305023902/http://www.adamgreen.net/news_archive3.html |archive-date=2005-03-05 }}</ref> The Strokes dedicated their album ''[[Room on Fire]]'' to his memory.

In 2003 a second album ''[[Moldy Peaches 2000: Unreleased Cutz and Live Jamz 1994-2002|Moldy Peaches 2000]]'' was released, a double-CD compilation of various scraps and live recordings.

After an extensive US headlining tour in the winter of 2003, the band went into hiatus in early 2004. However, the band reunited in late 2004 for a one-off show to benefit Accidental CDs, Records and Tapes, a hole-in-the-wall record store on Ave A in NYC. That store was an early supporter of the band and helped hook them up with the gig that ultimately got them their record deal. Both central members embarked on solo careers.

On December 2, 2007, Dawson and Green played an impromptu set together at Los Angeles' The Smell to end a show where Dawson was headlining. They changed the lyrics of the song "Who's Got The Crack" to "Who's Got The Blues".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rawkblog.blogspot.com/2007/12/live-kimya-dawson-moldy-peaches-smell.html|title=Live: Kimya Dawson & the Moldy Peaches @ the Smell, 12.2.07|publisher=The Rawking Refuses To Stop!|location=Los Angeles|last=Katz|first=Greg|date=2007-12-03|access-date=2007-12-05}}</ref> On December 3, 2007 the Moldy Peaches played at the ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]'' film premiere.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/47444-the-moldy-peaches-reunite-for-ijunoi-premiere|title=The Moldy Peaches Reunite for ''Juno'' Premiere|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|last=Solarski|first=Matthew|date=2007-12-04|access-date=2007-12-05|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213013929/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/47444-the-moldy-peaches-reunite-for-ijunoi-premiere|archive-date=2007-12-13}}</ref>
