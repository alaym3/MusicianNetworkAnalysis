They built on their acid jazz sound in their early releases and later drew from [[Rock music|rock]], [[disco]], [[Electronic music|electronic]] and [[Latin music]] genres. Lyrically, the group have addressed social and [[environmental justice]]. Kay has remained as the only original member through several line-up changes.

The band made their debut under [[Acid Jazz Records]], but they subsequently found mainstream success under [[Sony Music|Sony]]. While under this label, three of their albums have charted at number one in the UK, including ''[[Emergency on Planet Earth]]'' (1993), ''[[Synkronized]]'' (1999) and ''[[A Funk Odyssey]]'' (2001). The band's 1998 single, "[[Deeper Underground]]", was also number one in their native country.

Their third album, ''[[Travelling Without Moving]]'' (1996), received a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for the best-selling funk album in history.
