==Biography==
Bailey was born in [[Islington, Jamaica|Islington]] in St. Mary in 1967.<ref name="Walters20120720">Walters, Basil (2012) "[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/Entertainment/Capleton-lauded-for-charity-work_11982686 Capleton lauded for charity work] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723034412/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/Capleton-lauded-for-charity-work_11982686 |date=23 July 2012 }}", ''[[Jamaica Observer]]'', 20 July 2012, retrieved 29 July 2012</ref> As a youth, he was given the surname of a popular St. Mary lawyer and friend of the family, Capleton, as a nickname by his relatives and friends.<ref name=Chi>[http://www.chicagoreggae.com/capletoninterview.htm Capleton interview] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708143725/http://www.chicagoreggae.com/capletoninterview.htm |date=8 July 2011 }}.

Capleton rejects the name given to him at birth. He now prefers "King Shango", given its roots in the [[Yoruba language]].<ref>Barrow, Musa.

As a teenager, he sneaked out of his home to catch local dancehall acts, eventually leaving St. Mary for Kingston at the age of 18 to work on his career as a dancehall deejay.<ref>"Capleton."

== Early career ==
[[File:Capleton.JPG|thumb|220px|right|Capleton in concert, 2006, in Germany]]
In 1989, he got his first big international exposure. Stewart Brown, owner of a [[Toronto]]-based sound called African Star, gave the untested artist his first break, flying him to Canada for a stage show alongside [[Ninjaman]] and Flourgon.<ref name=Chi/>

When Capleton first arrived on the scene in the late 1980s, [[slackness]] and gun talk were the dominant lyrics in the dancehalls. The pre-Rasta Capleton had a string of hit songs from "Bumbo Red" to "Number One on the Look Good Chart" and "No Lotion Man".

He recorded the song that began to establish his significant place in Dancehall, "Alms House" in 1992. The tune became a big hit in the dancehall, followed up immediately by "Music is a Mission" and the massive hit "Tour". By 1993, he was voicing tunes which became increasingly conscious, such as "Prophet" and "Cold Blooded Murderer".

Tunes such as "Tour" and "Wings of the Morning" earned him a deal with Russell Simmons' [[Def Jam Recordings]],<ref>Campbell, Howard.

By 2004, some argued the quality of Capleton's music had been downgraded by over-proliferation on numerous [[riddim]]s, while Capleton himself argued his continued recording over both [[dancehall]] and [[roots reggae]] riddims created balance in his musical output.<ref>Smith, Germaine.

Capleton's annual 'A St Mary Mi Come From' live show has raised funds for several charities since it was first staged in 2000, including local schools and hospitals.<ref name="Walters20120720" />

== Religious views ==

== Criticisms ==
Capleton has faced criticism for [[Heterosexism|anti-gay]] lyrics in some of his songs though homosexuality remains illegal in his native Jamaica.<ref name=homophobia>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/1xtra/tx/documentaries/gayinja.shtml "Gay in JA: What's it like to be gay in a society where it's illegal to practice your sexuality?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104195127/http://www.bbc.co.uk/1xtra/tx/documentaries/gayinja.shtml |date=4 January 2012 }}, ''BBC''.
