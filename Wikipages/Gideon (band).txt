Also, a secondary source would be better.}} They also announced that they are no longer a Christian band. “We’re just very open-minded and loved making friends with people,” said vocalist and guitarist Tyler Riley. “And we didn’t understand why — if they believe something else — they would go to a different place when they die. I think that’s what kind of opened the door for me: making all these friends that believe totally different things to me and having to ask myself, 'What did they do to deserve Hell?'” The band had said they had started abandoning their faith as early as 2016. <ref>//www.kerrang.com/features/gideon-gave-up-christianity-and-made-their-best-album-to-date/</ref>
