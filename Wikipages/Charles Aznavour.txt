=== World War II ===
During the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation of France]] during World War II, Aznavour and his family hid "a number of people who were persecuted by the Nazis, while Charles and his sister Aida were involved in rescue activities." Their work was recognized in a statement issued in 2017 by [[Reuven Rivlin]], President of Israel. That year, Aznavour and Aida received the [[Raoul Wallenberg Award]] for their wartime activities. "The Aznavours were closely linked to the [[Missak Manouchian]] [[French Resistance|Resistance Group]] and in this context they offered shelter to Armenians, [[The Holocaust in France|Jews]] and others at their own Paris flat, risking their own lives."<ref name="Wallenberg Medal">{{cite web|title=Charles Aznavour and his sister Aida received the Raoul Wallenberg Medal|url=http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/news/charles-aznavour-and-his-sister-aida-received-the-raoul-wallenberg-medal|website=The International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation|access-date=1 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Legendary singer Aznavour given award for family efforts to save Jews in WWII|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/legendary-singer-aznavour-given-award-for-family-efforts-to-save-jews-in-wwii/|access-date=1 October 2018|work=[[The Times of Israel]]|agency=AFP|date=28 October 2017}}</ref>

==Career==

=== Musical career ===
Aznavour was already familiar with performing on stage by the time he began his career as a musician. At the age of nine, he had roles in a play called ''Un Petit Diable à Paris'' and a film entitled ''La Guerre des Gosses''.<ref name=encyclopedia>{{cite book|editor1-last=Henderson|editor1-first=Lol|editor2-last=Stacey|editor2-first=Lee|title=Encyclopedia of Music in the 20th Century|date=2014|publisher=Taylor and Francis|page=35|location=Hoboken|isbn=978-1135929466}}</ref> Aznavour then turned to professional dancing and performed in several nightclubs. In 1944, he and actor [[Pierre Roche (musician)|Pierre Roche]] began a partnership and in collaborative efforts performed in numerous nightclubs. It was through this partnership that Aznavour began to write songs and sing. Meanwhile, Aznavour wrote his first song entitled ''J'ai Bu'' in 1944.<ref name=encyclopedia /> The partnership's first successes were in Canada in 1948–1950. 

[[File:Charles Aznavour 1963.jpg|thumb|upright|Aznavour in 1963]]

During the early stages of his career, Aznavour opened for Edith Piaf at the [[Moulin Rouge]]. Piaf then advised him to pursue a career in singing. Piaf helped Aznavour develop a distinctive voice that stimulated the best of his abilities.<ref name=encyclopedia />
 
Sometimes described as "France's [[Frank Sinatra]]",<ref name="Deming">{{cite web|last=Deming|first=Mark|title=Charles Aznavour 40 Chansons D'or|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/40-chansons-dor-mw0000475684|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=30 June 2014}}</ref> Aznavour sang frequently about love. He wrote or co-wrote [[musical theater|musicals]], more than one thousand songs, and recorded ninety-one studio albums. Aznavour's voice was shaded towards the tenor range, but possessed the low range and coloration more typical of a baritone, contributing to his unique sound. Aznavour spoke and sang in many languages (French, English, Italian, Spanish, German, Russian, Armenian, Neapolitan and Kabyle), which helped him perform at [[Carnegie Hall]], in the US, and other major venues around the world. He also recorded at least one song from the 18th-century Armenian poet [[Sayat-Nova]] (in 1988), an Armenian-French song with [[Bratsch (band)|Bratsch]] (in 2007),<ref>[https://www.aravot-en.am/2018/10/08/219837/ What song was the French soldier singing at Aznavour's memorial service?

1972 saw the release of his 23rd studio album, ''Idiote je t'aime...'', which contained among others, two of his classics - "Les plaisirs démodés" (Old-Fashioned Pleasures) and "Comme ils disent" (As They Say), the latter dealing with homosexuality, which at the time, was revolutionary.

In 1974, Aznavour became a major success in the United Kingdom when his song "[[She (Charles Aznavour song)|She]]" was number 1 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] for four weeks during a fourteen-week run. His other well-known song in the UK was the 1973 "[[The Old Fashioned Way (song)|The Old Fashioned Way]]", which was on UK charts for 15 weeks.<ref>Talent in Europe / Billboard 22 January 1977, p. 36</ref><ref>Songwriters: a biographical dictionary with discographies - by Nigel Harrison - 1998 - p. 28</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/Charles+Aznavour|title=Official Charts Company|website=www.officialcharts.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tsort.info/music/cw8ahr.htm|title=Song artist 642 - Charles Aznavour|publisher=Tsort.info|access-date=18 August 2015}}</ref>

The English singer [[Marc Almond]] was noted by Aznavour as his favourite interpreter of his songs, having covered Aznavour's "What makes a man a man" in the 1990s. Almond cited Aznavour as a major influence on his style and work. In 1974, [[Jack Jones (singer)|Jack Jones]] recorded an entire album of Aznavour compositions entitled ''Write Me A Love Song, Charlie'', re-released on CD in 2006.<ref>[http://jackjones.lolipop.jp/lovesongcharlie.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412044204/http://jackjones.lolipop.jp/lovesongcharlie.htm|date=12 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jack Jones|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GALD46|title=Jack Jones - Write Me a Love Song Charlie (Mini Lp Sleeve) - Amazon.com Music|website=Amazon|date=29 August 2006|access-date=18 August 2015}}</ref> Two years later, in 1976, Dutch singer [[Liesbeth List]] released her album ''Charles Aznavour Presents Liesbeth List'', which featured Aznavour's compositions with English lyrics. Aznavour and Italian tenor [[Luciano Pavarotti]] sang [[Charles Gounod|Gounod's]] aria "[[Ave Maria (Bach/Gounod)|Ave Maria]]" together. He performed with [[Russians|Russian]] cellist and friend [[Mstislav Rostropovich]] to inaugurate the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union#1958 to 2006|French presidency of the European Union]] in 1995. [[Elvis Costello]] recorded "She" for the film ''[[Notting Hill (film)|Notting Hill]]''. One of Aznavour's greatest friends and collaborators from the music industry was Spanish operatic tenor [[Plácido Domingo]], who often performs his hits, most notably a solo studio recording of "Les bâteaux sont partis" in 1985 and duet versions of the song in French and Spanish in 2008, as well as multiple live renditions of Aznavour's "Ave Maria". In 1994, Aznavour performed with Domingo again and Norwegian [[soprano]] [[Sissel Kyrkjebø]] at Domingo's third annual ''[[Plácido Domingo#Christmas in Vienna|Christmas in Vienna]]'' concert. The three singers performed a variety of carols, medleys and duets, and the concert was televised throughout the world, as well as [[Christmas in Vienna III|released on a CD]] internationally.<ref name=bach-cantatas>{{cite web|author=Aryeh Oron|url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Bio/Sissel.htm|title=Sissel Kyrkjebø (Soprano)|publisher=Bach-cantatas.com|date=October 2005|access-date=1 May 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Charles Aznavour03b.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Aznavour in concert in 1988]]

At the start of autumn 2006, Aznavour initiated his farewell tour, performing in the US and Canada, and earning very positive reviews. Aznavour started 2007 with concerts all over Japan and Asia. The second half of 2007 saw Aznavour return to Paris for over 20 shows at the [[Palais des congrès de Paris|Palais des Congrès]] in Paris, followed by more touring in Belgium, the Netherlands, and the rest of France. Aznavour had repeatedly stated that this farewell tour, health permitting, would likely last beyond 2010; after that, however, Charles Aznavour continued performing worldwide throughout the year.

===Civil rights=== 
Aznavour was well known for being a lifelong and active supporter of civil rights, fighting for equality among all races, religions and nationalities as he stated in many of his interviews during his lifetime.  He was an early supporter of [[LGBT rights by country or territory|LGBT rights]]. His 1972 album, ''Idiote je t'aime...'', contained among others, one of his classics, "Comme ils disent" ("As They Say", the English version of which is titled "What Makes a Man"). The song, the story of a transvestite, was revolutionary at a time when talking about homosexuality was a taboo. In a later interview, Charles said "It's a kind of sickness I have, talking about things you're not supposed to talk about. I started with homosexuality and I wanted to break every taboo."<ref>{{cite news|author=Angelique Chrisafis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/19/charles-aznavour-i-wanted-to-break-every-taboo|title=Charles Aznavour: 'I wanted to break every taboo'|newspaper=The Guardian|date=21 June 2015}}</ref>

=== Armenian activism ===

Since the [[1988 Armenian earthquake]], Aznavour helped the country through his charity, Aznavour for Armenia. Together with his brother in-law and co-author [[Georges Garvarentz]] he wrote the song "[[Pour toi Arménie]]", which was performed by a group of famous French artists and topped the charts for eighteen weeks. There are squares named after him with his statues [[Charles Aznavour Square, Yerevan|in central Yerevan]] on [[Abovyan Street]], and [[Charles Aznavour Square, Gyumri|in northern part of Gyumri]], which saw the most lives lost in the earthquake. In 1995 Aznavour was appointed an Ambassador and Permanent Delegate of Armenia to [[UNESCO]]. Aznavour was a member of the [[Armenia Fund]] International Board of Trustees.

Along with holding the mostly ceremonial title of French [[ambassador-at-large]] to Armenia, Aznavour agreed to hold the position of Ambassador of Armenia to Switzerland on 12 February 2009:

Aznavour was increasingly involved in French, Armenian and international politics as his career progressed. During the [[2002 French presidential election]]s, when far-right nationalist [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] of the [[National Front (France)|National Front]] made it into the runoff election, facing incumbent [[Jacques Chirac]], Aznavour signed the "Vive la France" petition, and called on all French to "sing the [[La Marseillaise|Marseillaise]]" in protest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfimusique.com/siteEN/biographie/biographie_6059.asp|title=Biography – Charles Aznavour|publisher=Rfimusique.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110416155211/http://www.rfimusique.com/siteen/biographie/biographie_6059.asp|archive-date=16 April 2011|url-status=dead|access-date=1 May 2011}}</ref> Chirac, a personal friend of Aznavour's, ended up winning in a landslide, carrying over 82% of the vote.

Extension of term of protection would be good for European culture, positive for the European economy and would put an end the current discrimination with the U.S." He also notably butted heads with French politician [[Christine Boutin]] over her defense of a "global license" flat-fee authorization for sharing of copyrighted files over the internet, claiming that the license would eliminate creativity. In May 2009, the French [[Senate of France|Senate]] approved one of the strictest [[Copyright law of France|internet anti-piracy bills]] ever with a landslide 189–14 vote. Aznavour was a vocal proponent of the measure and considered it a rousing victory:

There will be no more songs, no more books, nothing at all.

In August 2017, at age 93, he was awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/08/25/french-singer-charles-aznavour-gets-hollywood-star-age-93/|title=French singer Charles Aznavour gets Hollywood star at age of 93|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|via=Reuters News|date=25 August 2017|access-date=5 May 2018}}</ref>

Aznavour has sold more than 200 million albums, making him one of the best selling music artists of all time.{{cn|date=September 2021}}

Aznavour has been widely regarded as one of the most famous [[Armenians]] of his time, and a major pop culture icon of the 20th century. {{cn|date=September 2021}}

His musicality and fame abroad had a significant impact on many areas of pop culture. Aznavour's name inspired the alias of the character [[Char Aznable]] by [[Yoshiyuki Tomino]] in his 1979 [[mecha anime]] series ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]''. Char would become a Japanese pop cultural icon and the most famous character over a decades-long franchise. 

Music critic Stephen Holden described Aznavour as a "French pop deity".{{cn|date=September 2021}}

His song "[[Parce Que Tu Crois]]" was sampled by producer [[Dr. Dre]] for the song "What's the Difference" (featuring [[Eminem]] & [[Xzibit]]), from his album ''[[2001 (Dr. Dre album)|2001]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.samples.fr/blog/index.php/2007/03/27/1170-dr-dre-what-s-difference/|title=Dr DRE, What's the difference|publisher=Samples.fr|date=27 March 2007|access-date=18 August 2015}}</ref>

He was mentioned in [[The Psychedelic Furs]] song "Sister Europe" ("The radio upon the floor / is stupid, it plays Aznavour"), the [[Kemal Monteno]] song "Stavi tiho Aznavoura" ("''Play Aznavour quietly''") and the [[Jonathan Richman]] song "Give Paris One More Chance".{{cn|date=September 2021}}

In 1990, he offered insights into his life to writer-director [[Michael Feeney Callan]] in the TV series ''My Riviera'', which was filmed at and around Aznavour's home in [[Port Grimaud]], in the South of France.{{cn|date=September 2021}}

== Personal life ==
[[File:Charles aznavour.jpg|thumb|left|Aznavour in the late 2000s]]

Aznavour was married three times: to Micheline Rugel (in 1946),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002198/bio|title=Biography for Charles Aznavour|publisher=imdb.com|access-date=29 January 2013}}</ref> Evelyn Plessis (in 1956) and his widow, Ulla Thorsell (in 1967). Five children were produced by these marriages: [[Seda Aznavour|Seda]], Patrick, Katia, Mischa, and Nicolas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monsieur-biographie.com/celebrite/biographie/charles_aznavour-1503.php|title=Biographie de Charles Aznavour|publisher=leParisien.fr|access-date=29 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.femmeactuelle.fr/actu/news-actu/charles-aznavour-qui-sont-ses-six-enfants-2070163|title=Charles Aznavour : qui sont ses six enfants, Seda, Charles, Patrick, Katia, Mischa et Nicolas ?|date=1 October 2018|magazine=[[Femme Actuelle]]|access-date=10 October 2018}}</ref> A sixth child, Charles Jr., supposedly born in 1952, was invented by [[Yves Salgues]], who was Aznavour's first official biographer, but also a heroin addict.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Aznavour often joked about his physique, the most talked-about aspect of which was his height; he stood {{convert|160|cm|ftin|0|abbr=on}} tall. He made this a source of self-deprecating humour over the years.<ref name="encyclopedia" />

In April 2018, shortly before his 94th birthday, Aznavour was taken to hospital in [[Saint Petersburg]] after straining his back during a rehearsal prior to a concert in the city. The concert was postponed until the following season, but eventually cancelled since he died six months later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asbarez.com/171907/charles-aznavour-hospitalized-in-st-petersburg/|title=Charles Aznavour Hospitalized in St. Petersburg – Asbarez.com|website=asbarez.com|access-date=5 May 2018|date=25 April 2018}}</ref> On 5 May 2018, he was a guest on BBC Radio 2's ''[[Graham Norton#Radio|Graham Norton]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0b196f5|title=With Pam Ayres, Charles Aznavour, plus Rylan Clark-Neal and Scott Mills, Graham Norton – BBC Radio 2|website=BBC|access-date=5 May 2018}}</ref>

A week later, on 12 May, he broke his arm in two places in a fall at his home in the village of [[Mouriès]], resulting in the cancellation of all shows until the end of June. This was eventually extended to include the 18 shows scheduled for August, because of a longer healing process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/general/charles-aznavour-cancels-more-appearances-due-to-broken-arm-60724248/|title=Charles Aznavour cancels more appearances due to broken arm|website=hollywood.com|access-date=2 October 2018|date=18 June 2018}}</ref> In a program on French television broadcast on 28 September, only three days before his death, he mentioned that he was still feeling the pain.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO3VdHuop50|title=Aznavour: le monument français! – C à Vous – 28/09/2018|website=YouTube|date=28 September 2018|access-date=2 October 2018}}</ref>

On 5 October, Aznavour was honoured with a [[state funeral]] at [[Les Invalides]] military complex in Paris, with president [[Emmanuel Macron]] lauding him as one of the most important "faces of France". He praised Aznavour's lyrics, which he said appealed to "our secret fragility" and said the singer's words were "for millions of people a balm, a remedy, a comfort&nbsp;... For so many decades, he has made our life sweeter, our tears less bitter." His coffin was lifted away at the end to the sound of his hit song "Emmenez-Moi" (Take Me Along).<ref>{{cite news|author=Angelique Chrisafis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/05/in-france-poets-never-die-france-pays-homage-to-aznavour-funeral|title='In France, poets never die': Macron pays tribute to Aznavour 'Son of immigrants' likened to Apollinaire and praised for his cultural contribution to France|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 October 2018|access-date=14 October 2018}}</ref> Dignitaries attending the funeral also included [[French Prime Minister]] [[Édouard Philippe]], former presidents [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] and [[François Hollande]], as well as [[Armenian President]] [[Armen Sarkissian]] and Prime Minister [[Nikol Pashinyan]] and their wives.<ref>{{cite news|author=Brian Love|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-aznavour/france-bids-adieu-to-aznavour-pays-tribute-to-armenian-roots-idUSKCN1MF0YY|title=France bids adieu to Aznavour, pays tribute to Armenian roots|website=[[Reuters]]|date=5 October 2018|access-date=14 October 2018}}</ref>
