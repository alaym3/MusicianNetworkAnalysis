==History==
===2000: Formation and ''The Arrival''===
'''Bliss n Eso''' are a trio consisting of [[United States|American]] Jonathan Notley (MC Bliss), Australian Max MacKinnon (MC Eso) and [[Morocco|Moroccan]]/[[Berbers|Berber]] Tarik Ejjamai (DJ Izm). Notley moved to Australia in 1992 when he was thirteen and met MacKinnon while attending [[Glenaeon Rudolf Steiner School]] in Sydney.<blockquote>"When I got to Australia, I met Eso (MacKinnon) and he was the only guy at my school into hip-hop. It was so scarce you'd be lucky to find a hip-hop record in a store let alone a whole section."<small> – Jonathan "Bliss" Notley</small><ref name="Age">{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/entertainment/music/gig-previews--reviews/bliss-n-eso/2008/09/04/1220121416657.html |title=Bliss n Eso|publisher=[[The Age]]|last=Murffet|first=Andrew|date=4 September 2008|access-date=8 October 2008 | location=Melbourne}}</ref></blockquote><blockquote>"Back then hip hop was basically non-existent; there was no urban or hip-hop section in the CD stores. You'd be lucky to find a couple of albums like a [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] album or something if you went to the CD stores. So I guess that's one of the reasons why Max, who's Eso, and I kinda bonded at high school, I think, because he was really the only other guy in the school who was into hip-hop."<small> – Jonathan "Bliss" Notley</small><ref name="mix"/></blockquote>

MacKinnon later moved to [[Mosman High School]] in New South Wales, where he met Ejjamai.<ref name="Splendour">{{cite web|url=http://www.splendourinthegrass.com/artist.php?ArtistId=42 |title=Splendour in the Grass – 2008 lineup |publisher=[[Splendour in the Grass]] |access-date=12 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805041619/http://www.splendourinthegrass.com/artist.php?ArtistId=42 |archive-date=5 August 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The group initially went by the name of Bliss n Esoterikizm, but that proved to be too much of a mouthful for most people, and thus was shortened.<ref name="mix"/>
