===2012-2013: Formation===

In mid-2012 Loewenthal began experimenting in Melbourne with electronic music using Reason software and still working full-time in call centre.<ref name="LeFevre"/> He reconnected with Davis. Tunis-Plant was travelling Europe and developing new song ideas while Johnston was undertaking a Bachelor of Audio Engineering at John Martin Cass Academy. At the end of that year, Davis and Loewenthal moved back to Byron Bay; "After moving back up from Melbourne, we decided to make a more electronic-fused band and incorporate electronic production."<ref name="Burin">{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/local/videos/2013/10/15/3869457.htm | title = Byron band Tora plays acoustic live in the studio | last = Burin | first =Margaret | publisher= [[ABC North Coast]] ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]) | date = 15 October 2013 | accessdate = 15 April 2016 }}</ref> From October Loewenthal and Tunis-Plant rekindled their songwriting partnership for electronic-infused music. In January of the following year, Loewenthal began teaching music to Piccone, which developed into a songwriting partnership. When Johnston returned from Melbourne in May 2013, Tora officially formed as a five piece band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hearty-vibes.com/2014/08/tora-no-2450.html |title=Tora (No 2450) |publisher= hearty-vibes.com |date=9 August 2014 |accessdate=19 February 2015}}</ref> The group's name is from the Greek word τώρα ''tṓra'' meaning "now".<ref name="Banana">{{cite web | url = http://lifeisabanana.com/2013/09/24/introducing-tora/ | title= Introducing: Tora | publisher = Life Is a Banana | date = 24 September 2013 | accessdate = 15 April 2016 }}</ref> They released their first single, "Unobtainable",<ref name="LeFevre"/> co-written by Loewenthal and Tunis-Plant.

Loewenthal later recalled, "we just started making music in our bedroom, which was like a big granny flat sort of thing. The first Tora track we made in four days – 'Unobtainable' – it just came together and we were like 'wow'. Electronic music is so much more fun to play and make... So we made that track then stewed on it, then made heaps of tracks – then after a while we just decided to put them up and see what people thought. We got a much better reaction than we'd ever had for Alice Blu – so we were a bit excited about that."<ref name="LeFevre">{{cite news | url = http://www.theaureview.com/interviews/tora-byron-bay-on-songwriting-tours-and-everything-in-between | title = The AU Interview: Tora (Byron Bay) on Songwriting, Tours, and Everything in Between | last = LeFevre | first = Jules | publisher = the AU Review | date = 16 November 2014 | accessdate = 15 April 2016 }}</ref> According to Byron Bay Festival's correspondent, they played a "blend of ambient harmonies, layered rhythms and pulsing soundscapes."<ref name="Surf Fest">{{cite web | url = http://www.byronbaysurffestival.com.au/tora/ | title = Tora | publisher = Byron Bay Surf Festival | date = October 2014 | accessdate = 14 April 2016 }}</ref> Aside from electronica they perform in the new-age genre, [[chillwave]].<ref name="Air It"/><ref name="Longley"/>

=== 2017-2018: Take A Rest ===
In 2017 Tora released their debut album, 'Take A Rest', which was added to high rotation on triple j and received acclaim from Elton John (Beats 1), Annie Mac (BBC Radio 1), BBC 6 Music, rotation on Germany's Flux FM and Radio Eins, as well as being a favourite amongst global tastemakers such as Line of Best Fit, Indie Shuffle and Pigeons & Planes. Alongside spins from LA's premiere radio outlet KCRW, the album united fans and tastemakers, and connected with all corners of the planet.

After playing atGlastonbury, Splendour In The Grass, The Great Escape, Canadian Music Week, and also supporting artists like RÜFÜS DO SOL, SAFIA and Miami Horror, the release of ’Take A Rest’ saw Tora return to touring the world, supporting the likes of Oh Wonder (UK), as well as showcasing the album live in extensive jaunts through the UK, Europe and Australia and performing their own sold-out shows in London, Amsterdam, Paris, Melbourne and at home in Byron Bay.

Much of this time was also spent working on new material, spending focused time in London, LA, Berlin and Amsterdam writing, collaborating, learning and growing. The fruits of this quiet dedication are clear, with now around 1 million monthly listeners on Spotify alone (2019).

In 2018 Tora released ‘Wouldn’t Be The Same’ featuring Brisbane artist Keelan Mak. The track has now clocked over 2 million streams.

=== 2019: Can't Buy The Mood ===
On March 1, Tora released ‘Deviate’, which was Co-written and co-produced in London at the iconic RAK Studios with Roy Kerr (London Grammar, Lana Del Rey). This laid the foundations for the announcement of sophomore album ‘Can’t Buy The Mood’ (9 August 2019 via LUSTRE) a body of work deeply inspired by themes of human connection, and which also displays an equally intriguing array of beautifully crafted songs that morph and transport to another world. Whilst Can't Buy The Mood was primarily made in the region of Byron Bay, the band also ventured into iconic studio spaces in LA, London and Amsterdam to work on the album. Completely written and produced by the band themselves, they also did all the design and artwork, completing an artistic vision which was key to the holistic experience of the album. With field recordings once again a key feature, the album is 13 tracks full of lush grooves and intricate moments.
