==Biography==
Sohodolls were formed in 2003 as an [[all-female band]] signed to A&G Records, with their first line-up consisting of Sammi Doll (Sammie Rayson) , Maya Von Doll (Maya von der Louw) and Pato (Pato Munich) . Their debut single "Stripper" would be released in 2004, and was the only release with Sammi as vocals
, as she would leave the group soon after.

In 2004, Maya von Doll recruited guitarists [[Toni Sailor]] (Sailor Doll) and Gavin Jay after they attended a performance at the Rhythm Factory in London, setting the layer of the second line-up.

In mid-2006, soon after releasing their second single "Pleasures of Soho", both Gavin Jay and Sammi Doll decided to part ways with the Sohodolls. Wanting to explore more additions to the group in instruments, Maya and Toni found Steven Weston (Weston Doll) who took over the role on keyboards/synths. They then hired Paul Stone and Matt Lord to play [[drums]] and [[double bass]], giving the group its third and current line-up.

The band's first two singles, released on Poptones, Alan McGee's record label, caused enough of a stir to reach numbers seven and twelve on the [[UK Indie Chart]]. These were followed by another release of "Stripper", "No Regrets" and then "Right and Right Again", which won acclaim from ''The Fly'' to ''Clash'' and ''[[NME]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} They began writing and recording their debut album in 2006 with producers Robert Harder ([[Babyshambles]], [[The Sunshine Underground]]) and Steve Lyon ([[The Clash]], [[Depeche Mode]]).<ref>[http://www.sohodolls.co.uk/main.htm "Sohodolls biography"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070726155740/http://www.sohodolls.co.uk/main.htm |date=26 July 2007 }}. sohodolls.co.uk.
