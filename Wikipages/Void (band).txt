'''Void''' was an American [[hardcore punk]] band formed in [[Columbia, Maryland]], United States, in 1980. The group was a pioneering force in the thriving [[Washington, D.C. hardcore|D.C. Hardcore]] scene in [[Washington D. C.]] during the early 1980s, successfully combining elements of [[punk rock|punk]] with [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] in a style that was accepted by the scene's otherwise exclusive community. Void's [[punk metal]] fusion sound was marked by [[guitarist]] Bubba Dupree's innovative guitar work and the "unhinged" [[vocals]] of John Weiffenbach, which resonated in the band's chaotic but popular live performances. Like many of their contemporaries, Void had a short-lived recording career—limited to the split-[[album]], ''[[Faith/Void Split]]'', with [[The Faith (American band)|the Faith]] on [[Dischord Records]]—however, they have enjoyed an enduring cult following among hardcore aficionados.

==History==
Inspired by [[punk rock]] bands [[the Teen Idles]] and [[Minor Threat]], Void—a name which referred to [[Black Sabbath]]'s song "[[Into the Void (Black Sabbath song)|Into the Void]]"—was formed in 1979,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rettman |first1=Tony |title=Bad Dreams and Torn Ligaments: An Interview with Void's Chris Stover |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/6e4zj4/void-interview-2015 |website=[[Vice Media]] |access-date=30 October 2019}}</ref> and consisted of an interracial line-up unique to the era, featuring high school students Jon "Bubba" Dupree ([[lead guitar]]), John Weiffenbach ([[lead vocals]]), Chris Stover ([[bass guitar]]), and Sean Finnegan ([[drums]]).<ref name=papers>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/arts/music/blog/13076396/void-discusses-emptying-the-vaults-being-punk-rock-in-columbia|title=Void Discusses Empting the Vaults, Being Punk Rock in Columbia|website=Washingoncitypapers.com|author=Burton, Brent|access-date=August 13, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/27/faith-void-dischord-washington-hardcore-punk|title=The Faith and Void|website=Theguardian.com|author=Finn, Craig|access-date=August 13, 2016}}</ref> The group soon began associating with scenesters [[Ian MacKaye]], [[Henry Rollins]], and Bert Queiroz, who introduced Void to artists of the flourishing [[underground music]] scene in [[Washington, D.C. hardcore|Washington D.C.]]. By late 1980, Void was embraced by the generally exclusive D.C. punk community, even though the band was not native to the city, being in closer proximity to Baltimore's scene. Dupree, while reflecting on the band's acceptance, considered Void "the outcast rednecks" who did not initially reflect upon the [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] style associated with contemporary groups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amoeba.com/void/artist/145510|title=Void|website=Amoeba.com|author=Hall, Oliver|access-date=August 13, 2016}}</ref>

Void first performed in D.C. at a Wilson Center hardcore festival organized by [[Bad Brains]], where the group was one of 15 bands present.<ref name=dischord>{{cite web|url=http://www.dischord.com/band/void|title=Bands: Void|website=Dischord.com|access-date=August 13, 2016}}</ref> The band was notorious for its live act, which thrived off Weiffenbach's chaotic stage persona and his manic vocals. Additionally, Void's sound was marked by alternating blasts of [[power chord]]s and shrieking [[Audio feedback|feedback]] within brief but upbeat songs, creating a higher degree of intensity than most of their contemporaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/void-mn0001742272|title=Void - Biography|website=allmusic.com|author=Huey, Steve|access-date=August 13, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/void.html|title=Void|website=Furious.com|author=Bass, Scott|access-date=August 13, 2016}}</ref> In 1981, Void entered the studio for the first time, cutting demos titled "Condensed Flesh" at [[record producer]] [[Don Zientara]]’s [[Inner Ear Studios]]. Songs from the session and additional studio time later in the year later surfaced on the ''Condensed Flesh'' [[extended play|EP]] in 1992.<ref name=session>{{citation|title=''Sessions 1981-1983'' (CD booklet)|publisher=Dischord Records|year=2011|author=McKaye, Ian}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, Ian MacKaye signed Void to his co-owned label [[Dischord Records]], and the group made their debut in January 1982 on the [[compilation album]] ''[[Flex Your Head]]'', which featured the three songs "Dehumanized", "Authority", and "My Rules".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dischord.com/release/007/flex-your-head|title=Various artists - Flex Your Head|website=Dischord.com|access-date=August 13, 2016}}</ref>

In mid-1982, Void began touring across the Northeast, most notably at the [[CBGB]] music club, and introduced characteristics of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] into their music, which became influential in originating [[punk metal]] fusion. Initially, this blend arose organically, and was further explored on the [[split album]], ''[[Faith/Void Split]]'', with fellow D.C. band [[The Faith (American band)|the Faith]] in September 1982.<ref name=dreams>{{cite web|url=http://m.noisey.vice.com/blog/void-interview-2015|title=BAD DREAMS AND TORN LIGAMENTS: AN INTERVIEW WITH VOID'S CHRIS STOVER|website=M.noisey.vice.com|author=Rettman, Tony|access-date=August 13, 2016}}</ref> The split album is hailed as one of the earliest examples of hardcore-metal crossover, and Void's frantic musical approach is often considered particularly influential.<ref name=papers/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-faith-void-split-mw0000233256|title=The Faith / Void Split - Review|website=[[AllMusic]]|author=Raggett, Ned|access-date=August 13, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/43787/Faith-Void-Split/|title=Faith / Void Split|website=Sputnikmusic.com|access-date=August 13, 2016}}</ref> Music critic Doug Mosurock described Void's side of the album as "quintessential American hardcore", also noting that "Very few bands could match the aggression, intensity, and amateur/weirdo vibes on display within Void’s dozen tracks from the split".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/6767|title=Void "My Rules"|website=Dustedmagazine.com|author=Mosurock, Doug|access-date=August 13, 2016}}</ref> Dischord Records first reissued ''Faith/Void Split'' in 1985 and digitally remastered it in 2008.<ref name=dischord/>

With Finnegan insisting the band needed multi-track facilities, Void choose not to resign with Dischord, and instead made a deal with [[Touch and Go Records]] in mid-1983. The group recorded an album's worth of material; however, the band members where drifting in different musical directions including [[glam rock]], [[hip hop]], and [[hard rock]].<ref name=dreams/> Void strayed further apart because of their gigs becoming increasingly manic, and by late 1983 the group disbanded after the members graduated from high school. Corey Rusk, the owner of Touch and Go, was uninterested in releasing the album of a dissolved band while in the midst of securing a big deal with the [[Butthole Surfers]].<ref name=session/> Although members of Void were adamant about leaving the botched album unreleased, hardcore aficionados heavily bootlegged it onto [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] tapes titled ''Potions for Bad Dreams''. Bands such as [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]] and [[the Melvins]] have claimed ''Potions for Bad Dreams'' shaped their own musical styles.<ref name=dreams/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://noisecreep.com/lost-albums/|title=Lost Albums: Seven Records That Never Saw the Light of Day|website=Noisecreep.com|author=Gitter, Mike|access-date=August 13, 2016}}</ref>

Dupree was the only member of Void to continue his music career after the band, guesting with [[Soundgarden]], [[Moby]], and [[Dave Grohl]] in the 1990s and 2000s. In 2011, Dischord Records released the [[compilation album]] ''[[Sessions 1981-83]]'', which featured studio outtakes, previously-unreleased tracks, and live recordings between 1981 and 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15969-sessions-198183/|title=Sessions 1981-1983|website=Pitchfork.com|author=Shteamer, Hank|access-date=August 13, 2016}}</ref> Finnegan died of a heart attack in 2008. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dischord.com/news/223/2008/2/sean-finnegan-of-void-passes-away-at-43|title=Dischord Records: Sean Finnegan (of Void) Passes Away At 43|website=Dischord.com|access-date=24 September 2020}}</ref>
