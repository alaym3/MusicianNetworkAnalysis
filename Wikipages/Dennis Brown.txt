'''Dennis Emmanuel Brown''' [[Order of Distinction|CD]] (1 February 1957 – 1 July 1999) was a [[Jamaica|Jamaican]] [[reggae]] singer. During his prolific career, which began in the late 1960s when he was aged eleven, he [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] more than 75 albums and was one of the major stars of [[lovers rock]], a subgenre of [[reggae]]. [[Bob Marley]] cited Brown as his favourite singer,<ref>[http://reggaetrain.com/biodbrown.asp Dennis Brown] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221145721/http://reggaetrain.com/biodbrown.asp |date=21 December 2007 }} ReggaeTrain.com, accessed 3 December 2007.</ref> dubbing him "The Crown Prince of Reggae", and Brown would prove influential on future generations of reggae singers.<ref name="Thompson43">Thompson (2002), p. 43.</ref><ref name="Adebayo">Adebayo (1999).</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Dennis Brown was born on 1 February 1957 at the Victoria Jubilee Hospital in [[Kingston, Jamaica]].<ref name="Reel09">Reel (2000), p. 9.</ref> His father Arthur was a scriptwriter, actor, and journalist, and he grew up in a large tenement yard between North Street and King Street in Kingston with his parents, three elder brothers and a sister, although his mother died in the 1960s.<ref name="Reel09" /><ref name="Simmonds">Simmonds (2008), p. 416.</ref> He began his singing career at the age of nine, while still at junior school, with an end-of-term concert the first time he performed in public, although he had been keen on music from an even earlier age, and as a youngster was a keen fan of American balladeers such as [[Brook Benton]], [[Sam Cooke]], [[Frank Sinatra]], and [[Dean Martin]].<ref name="Reel09" /> He cited [[Nat King Cole]] as one of his greatest early influences.<ref name="Reel09" /> He regularly hung around JJ's record store on Orange Street in the [[rocksteady]] era and his relatives and neighbours would often throw Brown pennies to hear him sing in their yard.<ref name="Reel09" /> Brown's first professional appearance came at the age of eleven, when he visited "Tit for Tat" a local West Kingston Nightclub where his brother Basil was performing a comedy routine, and where he made a guest appearance with the club's resident group, the Fabulous Falcons (a group that included [[Cynthia Richards]], [[Scotty (musician)|David "Scotty" Scott]], and Noel Brown).<ref name="Reel09 " /> On the strength of this performance he was asked to join the group as a featured vocalist.<ref name="Reel09" /> When the group performed at a [[Jamaica Labour Party|JLP]] conference at the National Arena, Brown sang two songs – [[Desmond Dekker]]'s "Unity" and [[Johnnie Taylor]]'s "Ain't That Loving You" – and after the audience showered the stage with money, he was able to buy his first suit with the proceeds.<ref name="Reel09" /> Bandleader [[Byron Lee]] performed on the same bill, and was sufficiently impressed with Brown to book him to perform on package shows featuring visiting US artists, where he was billed as the "Boy Wonder".<ref name="Reel09" />

As a young singer Brown was influenced by older contemporaries such as [[Delroy Wilson]] (whom he later cited as the single greatest influence on his style of singing),<ref name="Walker">Walker (2006), p. 214.</ref> [[Errol Dunkley]], [[John Holt (singer)|John Holt]], [[Ken Boothe]], and [[Bob Andy]].<ref name="Reel09" /> Brown's first [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] was an original song called "Lips of Wine" for producer [[Derrick Harriott]], but when this was not released, he recorded for [[Clement "Coxsone" Dodd]]'s [[Studio One (record label)|Studio One]] label, and his first session yielded the single "No Man is an Island", recorded when Brown was aged twelve and released in late 1969.<ref name="Reel10">Reel (2000), p. 10.</ref> The single received steadily increasing airplay for almost a year before becoming a huge hit throughout Jamaica.<ref name="Reel10" /> Brown recorded up to a dozen sessions for Dodd, amounting to around thirty songs, and also worked as a backing singer on sessions by other artists, including providing harmonies along with [[Horace Andy]] and [[Larry Marshall (singer)|Larry Marshall]] on [[Alton Ellis]]'s ''Sunday Coming'' album.<ref name="Reel10" /><ref name="Foster244">Foster (1999), p. 244.</ref> Brown was advised by fellow Studio One artist Ellis to learn guitar to help with his songwriting, and after convincing Dodd to buy him an instrument, was taught the basics by Ellis.<ref name="Reel10" /> These Studio One recordings were collected on two albums, ''[[No Man is an Island (album)|No Man is an Island]]'' and ''If I Follow my Heart'' (the title track penned by Alton Ellis), although Brown had left Studio One before either was released.<ref name="Reel12">Reel, p. 12.</ref> He went on to record for several producers including [[Lloyd Daley]] ("Baby Don't Do It" and "Things in Life"), [[Prince Buster]] ("One Day Soon" and "If I Had the World"), and [[Phil Pratt]] ("Black Magic Woman", "Let Love In", and "What About the Half"), before returning to work with Derrick Harriott, recording a string of popular singles including "Silhouettes", "Concentration", "He Can't Spell", and "Musical Heatwave", with the pick of these tracks collected on the ''Super Reggae and Soul Hits'' album in 1973.<ref name="Reel13">Reel, p. 13.</ref> Brown also recorded for [[Vincent "Randy" Chin]] ("Cheater"), [[Dennis Alcapone]] ("I Was Lonely"), and [[Herman Chin Loy]] ("It's Too Late" and "Song My Mother Used to Sing") among others, with Brown still at school at this stage of his career.<ref name="Reel17">Reel, p. 17.</ref>

===International success===
In 1972, Brown began an association that would result in his breakthrough as an internationally successful artist; He was asked by [[Joe Gibbs (record producer)|Joe Gibbs]] to record an album for him, and one of the tracks recorded as a result, "Money in my Pocket", was a hit with UK reggae audiences and quickly became a favourite of his live performances. This original version of "Money in my Pocket" was in fact produced by [[Winston Holness|Winston "Niney" Holness]] on behalf of Gibbs, with musical backing from the [[Soul Syndicate]].<ref name="Reel19">Reel, p. 19.</ref> In the same year, Brown performed as part of a Christmas morning showcase in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada, along with Delroy Wilson, Scotty, Errol Dunkley, and the Fabulous Flames, where he was billed as the "Boy Wonder of Jamaica" and was considered the star of the show in a local newspaper review.<ref name="Reel19" /> The song's popularity in the UK was further cemented with the release of a [[Deejay (Jamaican)|deejay]] version, "A-So We Stay (Money in Hand)", credited to [[Big Youth]] and Dennis Brown, which outsold the original single and topped the Jamaican singles chart.<ref name="Reel19" /> Brown and Holness became close, even sharing a house in Pembroke Hall.<ref name="Foster244" /> Brown followed this with another collaboration with Holness on "Westbound Train", which was the biggest Jamaican hit of summer 1973,<ref name="Reel20">Reel, p. 20.</ref> and Brown's star status was confirmed when he was voted Jamaica's top male vocalist in a poll by ''Swing'' magazine the same year.<ref name="Reel20" /> Brown followed this success with "Cassandra" and "No More Will I Roam", and tracks such as "Africa" and "Love Jah", displaying Brown's [[Rastafari]] beliefs, became staples on London's [[Sound system (Jamaican)|sound system]] scene.<ref name="Reel20" /> In 1973, Brown was hospitalized due to fatigue caused by overwork, although at the time rumours spread that he only had one lung and had only a week to live, or had contracted [[tuberculosis]].<ref name="Reel20" /> He was advised to take an extended break from performing and concentrated instead on his college studies.<ref name="Reel20" />

Brown returned to music and toured the United Kingdom for the first time in late summer 1974 as part of a Jamaican showcase, along with [[Cynthia Richards]], Al Brown, [[Sharon Forrester]], and [[The Maytals]], after which he was invited to stay on for further dates (where he was backed by [[The Cimarons]], staying in the UK for another three months.<ref name="Reel23">Reel, p. 23.</ref> While in the UK, he recorded for the first time since his hospitalization, working with producer [[Sydney Crooks]], and again backed by the Cimarons.<ref name="Reel23" /> While Brown was in the UK, Gibbs released an album collecting recordings made earlier in Jamaica, released as ''The Best of Dennis Brown'', and Brown's first single to get a proper UK release was issued on the Synda label – "No More Will I Roam".<ref name="Reel25">Reel, p. 25.</ref> He returned to Jamaica for Christmas, but six weeks later was back in the UK, now with Holness in tow as his business manager, to negotiate a record deal with [[Trojan Records]], the first Brown album to be released as a result being ''Just Dennis'', although the pair would be left out of pocket after Trojan's collapse and subsequent buyout by Saga Records.<ref name="Reel27">Reel, p. 27.</ref> On their return to Jamaica, Brown and Holness resumed recording in earnest with tracks for a new album, including "So Long Rastafari", "Boasting", and "Open the Gate".<ref name="Reel28">Reel, p. 28.</ref> During 1975, Brown also recorded one-off sessions for [[Sonia Pottinger]] ("If You leave Me") and [[Bunny Lee]] ("So Much Pain", a duet with [[Johnny Clarke]]), and the first recordings began to appear on Brown's new DEB Music label.<ref name="Reel30">Reel, p. 30.</ref> In the wake of the Trojan collapse, Brown and Holness arranged a deal with local independent label owners Castro Brown (who ran Morpheus Records) and Larry Lawrence (Ethnic Fight) to distribute their releases in the UK.<ref name="Reel31">Reel, p. 31.</ref> Brown saw the UK as the most important market to target and performed for five consecutive nights at the Georgian Club in [[Croydon]] to raise funds to start his new DEB Music label with Castro Brown.<ref name="Reel33">Reel, p. 33.</ref> In early 1976, Castro secured a deal with [[BBC London 94.9|Radio London]] disc jockey [[Charlie Gillett]] for Morpheus (and hence DEB) output to be issued through the latter's Oval Records, which had a distribution deal with [[Virgin Records]], but after a dispute over Castro's separate supply of these records to London record shops, the deal was scrapped and the early DEB releases suffered from a lack of promotion.<ref name="Reel35">Reel, p. 35</ref> Later that year, Brown voiced two tracks at [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]]'s [[Black Ark]] studio, "Take a Trip to Zion" and "Wolf and Leopard", the latter of which was a hit in Jamaica and would prove to be one of Brown's most popular songs, with a lyric criticizing those criminals who "rode the natty dread bandwagon".<ref name="Reel39">Reel, p. 39</ref> Brown confirmed in an interview in ''[[Black Echoes]]'' that he had parted company with Holness, stating: "I was going along with one man's ideas for too long. Niney was trying to find a new beat at all times, which was disconcerting, so I hadn't been working with my true abilities. Now I know that I can produce myself."<ref name="Reel44">Reel, p. 44.</ref>

Brown began working again with Joe Gibbs, with an agreement that in return for studio time for his own productions, Brown would allow Gibbs use of any rhythm recorded in the process.<ref name="Reel45">Reel, p. 45</ref> The first album from this arrangement, the 1977 release ''[[Visions of Dennis Brown]]'', gave him his biggest success so far, blending conscious themes and love songs, and confirming Brown's transformation from child star to grown up artist.<ref name="Reel55">Reel, p. 55.</ref> The biblical-themed sleeve and portrait of [[Haile Selassie]] on the back complemented the [[roots reggae]] tracks on the album, including "Repatriation", "Jah Can Do it", and [[cover version]]s of [[Earl 16]]'s "Malcolm X" and [[Clive Hunt]]'s "Milk and Honey". The album immediately entered the ''Black Echoes'' chart and stayed there well into the following year, although it was only available in the UK as an expensive import.<ref name="Reel57">Reel, p. 57.</ref> ''Visions...'' was voted reggae album of the year by ''[[Melody Maker]]'' writers and was given the same award by readers of ''Black Echoes''.<ref name="Reel57" /> A reissued "Wolf and Leopard" single, and the eventual album release of the same name also sold well in the UK, both topping the ''Black Echoes'' chart.<ref name="Reel60">Reel, p. 60.</ref>

Brown toured the UK in Autumn 1977 with Big Youth, and described the tour: "It's like I was appointed to deliver certain messages and now is the time to deliver them".<ref name="Reel66">Reel, p. 66.</ref> He had also begun producing recordings by his protege, [[Junior Delgado]]. In 1978, Brown moved to live in London, and set up premises in Battersea Rise, near [[Clapham Junction]] to relaunch the DEB Music label with Castro Brown, with artists featured on the label including Junior Delgado, [[15.16.17]], [[Bob Andy]], Lennox Brown, and later, [[Gregory Isaacs]].<ref name="Reel69">Reel, p. 69.</ref> Brown had further success himself with a [[discomix]] of "How Could I Leave You", a version of The Sharks' rocksteady standard "How Could I Live" with accompanying toast by [[George Nooks|Prince Mohamed]]. In March 1978, Brown flew to Jamaica, where he was booked at the last minute to perform at the [[One Love Peace Concert]] at the National Arena, backed by [[Lloyd Parks]]' We The People Band.<ref name="Reel81">Reel, p. 81.</ref> ''Visions of Dennis Brown'' was given a wider distribution via a deal between Lightning Records and [[Warner Music Group|WEA]] and topped the UK reggae album chart in September 1978, this chart run lasting for five months.<ref name="Reel84">Reel, p. 84.</ref> In August 1978, Brown returned to the UK, bringing Junior Delgado with him, and DEB Music released a series of singles, although they sold moderately compared to the label's earlier successes, but in the same month, Brown's breakthrough single was first released. Initially released as a discomix featuring a new version of "Money in my Pocket" and the deejay version "Cool Runnings" by Price Mohamed, which became unavailable for a time after quickly selling out its first pressing, this single gave Brown his first [[UK Singles Chart|UK Top 40]] [[Hit record|hit]], reaching number 14 the following year and becoming one of the biggest international hits in Jamaica's history,<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">Roberts (2006), p. 81.</ref><ref name="Thompson44">Thompson, p. 44.</ref> after crossing over first into [[Soul music|soul]] clubs and then rock clubs.<ref name="Reel88">Reel, p. 88.</ref> This success led to Brown featuring on the cover of the ''[[NME]]'' in February 1979.

Brown's next two albums were both released on DEB – ''So Long Rastafari'' and ''Joseph's Coat of Many Colours'', although the label was closed down in 1979, after which Brown again did the rounds of Jamaica's top producers, as well as continuing self-productions with singles such as "The Little Village" and "Do I Worry?" in 1981.<ref name="Thompson45">Thompson, p. 45.</ref>

===A&M and the dancehall era===
With continuing commercial success, Brown signed an international deal with [[A&M Records]] in 1981, and now based permanently in the UK, his first album release for the label was the Gibbs-produced ''[[Foul Play (album)|Foul Play]]'', which while not wholly a success included the roots tracks "The Existence of Jah" and "The World is Troubled".<ref name="Thompson47">Thompson, p. 47.</ref> This was followed in 1982 by ''Love Has Found its Way'', a Gibbs/Brown/Willie Lindo production that blended lovers rock with a more pop sound, and again was not a great success.<ref name="Thompson47" /> His final album with the label, 1983's ''The Prophet Rides Again'', again mixed roots themes with commercial R&B style tracks, and proved to be his swansong with the label.<ref name="Thompson47" /> While his association with A&M had taken him in a more commercial pop direction, Kingston's music scene had shifted towards the new [[dancehall]] era, and Brown enthusiastically adapted to the new sound, recording for some of the genre's major producers including [[Prince Jammy]] and [[Gussie Clarke]]. In the early 1980s he also started a new label, Yvonne's Special, dedicated to his wife.<ref name="Foster246">Foster, p. 246.</ref> In 1984, he collaborated with Gregory Isaacs on the album ''Two Bad Superstars Meet'' and the hit single "Let aaf Sum'n", recorded with [[Sly & Robbie]] and Jammy, which was followed by a second album featuring the two stars, ''Judge Not'', in 1985.<ref name="Thompson46">Thompson, p. 46.</ref> Brown released a huge amount of work through the 1980s, including the 1986 Jammy-produced album ''The Exit'', but his biggest success of the decade came in 1989 with the Gussie Clarke-produced duet with Isaacs "Big All Round", and the album ''Unchallenged''.<ref name="Thompson46" /> He continued to record prolifically in the 1990s, notably on the ''Three Against War'' album in 1995 with [[Beenie Man]] and [[Triston Palma]], and on albums produced by Mikey Bennett, and his profile in the United States was raised by a series of album releases on [[RAS Records]].<ref name="Thompson46" /> In the late 1990s he was managed by [[Tommy Cowan]], who contrasted Brown to [[Bob Marley]], who he had also managed, stating "Bob Marley was a serious businessman, I don't think Dennis was as serious when it came to investment. Dennis was like a community person, he would earn money and in one hour he would give it away."<ref name="Campbell" /> Brown said of his approach to songwriting in the late 1990s:

<blockquote>"When I write a song I try to follow Joseph's way – deliverance through vision from all – true vibration. I want to be a shepherd in my work, teaching and learning, really singing so much. I don't want to sing and not live it. I must live it. If I can sing songs that people can watch me living, then they can take my work"<ref name="Chang">Chang & Chen (1998), p. 152.</ref></blockquote>

Brown's 1994 album ''Light My Fire'' was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]], as was the last album recorded by Brown, ''Let Me Be the One'' (in 2001).<ref name="Moskowitz">Moskowitz (2006), p. 43.</ref><ref name="Kenner">Kenner (2001).</ref>

===Death===
In the late 1990s, Brown's health began to deteriorate. He had developed respiratory issues, probably exacerbated by longstanding problems with drug addiction, mainly [[cocaine]],<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-dennis-brown-1103883.html Salewicz] (1999)</ref> leading to him being taken ill in May 1999 after touring in Brazil with other reggae singers, where he was diagnosed with [[pneumonia]].<ref name="Moskowitz" /> After returning to [[Kingston, Jamaica]], on the evening of 30 June 1999, he was rushed to Kingston's [[Teaching hospital|University Hospital]], suffering from cardiac arrest.<ref name="Cooksey">Cooksey, MusicianGuide.</ref> Brown died the next day, the official cause of his death was a [[Pneumothorax|collapsed lung]].<ref name="Thompson46" /><ref name="Cooksey" /><ref>Greene, Allmusic.</ref><ref>Salewicz (1999).</ref><ref>Doran (1999).</ref> Sitting Jamaican Prime Minister [[P. J. Patterson]] and former prime minister, serving at the time as opposition leader, [[Edward Seaga]] of the [[Jamaica Labour Party]] both spoke at Brown's funeral, which was held on 17 July 1999 in Kingston. The service, which lasted for three hours, also featured live performances by [[Maxi Priest]], [[Shaggy (artist)|Shaggy]], and three of Brown's sons. Brown was then buried at Kingston's [[National Heroes Park]].<ref>VH1</ref> Brown was survived by his wife Yvonne and ten children.<ref name="Adebayo" /> Prime Minister Patterson paid tribute to Brown, saying: "Over the years, Dennis Brown has distinguished himself as one of the finest and most talented musicians of our time. The Crown Prince of Reggae as he was commonly called. He has left us with a vast repertoire of songs which will continue to satisfy the hearts and minds of us all for generations to come."<ref name="Gleaner">''Jamaica Gleaner'', 2 July 1999.</ref>

Dennis Brown's brother Leroy Clarke spoke about his brother as follows; "I just give Jah thanks and praise for Dennis’ life and what he has contributed to the world through the root of music, regardless of the rumors out there about him, he has done a lot. He has paid his dues. You want to know the true Dennis? Listen to his lyrics. He was singing from the heart" (The Beat, Volume 18, #5/6).

==Legacy==
Dennis  Brown was an inspiration and influence for many reggae singers from the late 1970s through to the 2000s, including [[Barrington Levy]], [[Junior Reid]], [[Frankie Paul]], [[Luciano (singer)|Luciano]], [[Bushman (reggae singer)|Bushman]], and [[Richie Stephens (musician)|Richie Stephens]].<ref name="Campbell">Campbell, 2009.</ref> In July 1999, a group of UK-based musicians and more than fifty vocalists working under the collective name The British Reggae All Stars (including [[Mafia & Fluxy]], Carlton "Bubblers" Ogilvie, [[Peter Hunnigale]], [[Louisa Mark]], Nerious Joseph, and [[Sylvia Tella]]) recorded "Tribute Song", a medley of six of Brown's best-known songs, in memory of Brown.

He was honoured on the first anniversary of his death by a memorial concert in [[Brooklyn]], which featured performances from [[Johnny Osbourne]], Micky Jarrett, Delano Tucker, and [[Half Pint]].<ref name="Thompson46" /> In 2001, a charitable trust was set up in Brown's name. The Dennis Emanuel Brown Trust works to educate youngsters, maintain and advance the memory of Dennis Brown, and help to provide youngsters with musical instruments. The trust awards the Dennis Emanuel Brown (DEB) bursary for educational achievement each year to students between the ages of 10 and 12 years.<ref name="Walters2005">Walters (2005).</ref> In 2005, [[George Nooks]], who had worked with Brown in the mid-1970s in his deejay guise as Prince Mohamed, released an album of Brown covers, ''George Nooks Sings Dennis Brown: The Voice Lives On'', with Nooks stating: "I was always inspired by his talent and I used to sing like him. Dennis had a large influence on me. To me he was the greatest. He was my number one singer."<ref name="Jackson">Jackson (2005).</ref> In the same year, Gregory Isaacs paid a similar tribute with the album ''Gregory Isaacs Sings Dennis Brown''. In February 2007, a series of events were staged in Jamaica in celebration of the lives of both Brown and Marley (both would have had birthdays that month).<ref name="Evans">Evans (2007).</ref> In 2008, the Dennis Brown Trust announced a new internet radio station, dedicated solely to the music of Dennis Brown,<ref name="Walters2008">Walters (2008)</ref> and in the same month a tribute concert was staged by the Jamaican Association of Vintage Artistes and Affiliates (JAVAA) featuring [[Dwight Pinkney]], Derrick Harriott, [[Sugar Minott]], George Nooks, and [[John Holt (singer)|John Holt]].<ref name="Cooke">Cooke (2008).</ref>

Songs about or dedicated to Brown include "Song for Dennis Brown" by [[The Mountain Goats]], "If This World Were Mine" by [[Slightly Stoopid]], "Drive" by [[Pepper (band)]], and [[Whitney Houston]]'s "Whitney Houston Dub Plate" on ''[[The Ecleftic: 2 Sides II a Book]]'' album by [[Wyclef Jean]].

On 26 April 2010, Brown was featured on [[NPR]] ''[[Morning Edition]]'' news program as one of the "[[50 great voices]] – The stories of awe-inspiring voices from around the world and across time". The NPR "50 Great Voices" list includes [[Nat King Cole]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Mahalia Jackson]] and [[Jackie Wilson]] among others.<ref name="Johnson">Johnson, 2010.</ref>

On 6 August 2011, being the 49th anniversary of the country's independence, the [[Governor-General of Jamaica]] posthumously conferred the [[Order of Distinction]] in the rank of Commander (CD) upon Brown, for his contribution to the Jamaican music industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dancehall.mobi/2011/08/06/dennis-brown-millie-small-dobby-dobson-get-national-awards/|title=Dennis Brown, Millie Small & Dobby Dobson Get National Awards|publisher=Dancehall.mobi|access-date=23 September 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004142527/http://www.dancehall.mobi/2011/08/06/dennis-brown-millie-small-dobby-dobson-get-national-awards/|archive-date=4 October 2011}}</ref>
