In an interview with ''[[American Songwriter]]'' Ruess states, "I'm not one to take lessons, so I decided that the only way I was going to learn how to sing, if what they were saying was true, was to go in my car and put on any sort of music from a vocalist that might be really hard to mimic, turn it on as loud as possible and try to hit all those notes".<ref>{{cite web|title=fun.:Everyday Anthems|date=June 28, 2012|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/06/fun-everyday-anthems-2/|publisher=[[American Songwriter]]|access-date=July 2, 2012}}</ref> He took a job in a law firm as a way to support himself while he pursued his musical ambitions.<ref>[http://backbeatseattle.com/2011/06/22/interview-show-preview-fun-showbox-sodo-friday-624/ Interview & Show Preview: fun. @ Showbox SoDo Friday, 6/24], Back Beat Seattle, June 22, 2011.

==Career==

===2000–2008: The Format===
After forming in 2000,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theformat.com/05.html|title=theformat.com|date=February 19, 2003|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030219051757/http://theformat.com/05.html|archive-date=February 19, 2003}}</ref> [[the Format]] released a five-song EP, titled ''[[EP (The Format album)|EP]]'', which generated local interest and led to the band being signed to [[Elektra Records]] in 2002. They released their first studio album, ''[[Interventions + Lullabies]]'', on October 21, 2003, leading to more local mainstream success. The band's fanbase began to grow, and the Format released their second EP, ''[[Snails (The Format album)|Snails]]'', with [[Atlantic Records]] in April 2005. However, while working on their second album, ''[[Dog Problems]]'', they were dropped from Atlantic. They eventually created their own label, The Vanity Label, and released the album on July 10, 2006. On February 4, 2008, Ruess announced through the band's blog that the Format would not be making another album.

{{blockquote|We have just put out word that we will not be making a new Format album. Please understand this was a tough decision and we're both upset about it. While we accept there will be false speculation as to why, understand that Sam and I remain extremely close and in fact are still passing the [[Twin Peaks]] box set back and forth in an attempt to figure out who REALLY killed [[Laura Palmer]].

We also want to thank everyone with and within the Format, particularly Mike, Don, and Marko, whom without, none of this would have ever even been fully realized. We both suggest you support their musical talents and whatever they decide to do. And lastly we want to thank the fans who made this the best 5 years of our lives.<ref>[http://theformat.com/important-59120 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401221544/http://theformat.com/important-59120 |date=April 1, 2012 }}</ref>}}

===2008–2014: fun.===
[[File:Fun..jpg|thumb|Ruess performing with [[Fun (band)|Fun]] in March 2010.]]
Immediately after the split of the Format, Ruess contacted [[Jack Antonoff]] of [[Steel Train]] and [[Andrew Dost]], formerly of [[Anathallo]], to form a new band called [[Fun (band)|fun]]. They released their first demo, "Benson Hedges", through ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''{{'}}s September 20, 2009, article.<ref>{{cite web|last=Joyce |first=Colin |url=https://www.spin.com/2008/08/members-format-steel-train-anathallo-unite-fun/ |title=Members of the Format, Steel Train, Anathallo Unite as Fun |publisher=SPIN.com |date=August 20, 2008 |access-date=June 17, 2015}}</ref> Four months after releasing their first single, "At Least I'm Not as Sad (As I Used to Be)", through Myspace on April 6, 2009, Fun released their first studio album, entitled ''[[Aim and Ignite]]''. The album received generally positive reviews and peaked at 71 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

The band's first tour happened in 2008 supporting [[Jack's Mannequin]] and gained exposure opening for them as well as [[Paramore]] in 2010. On August 4, 2010, Fun announced that they had been signed to the [[Fueled by Ramen]] label.

In 2011, in collaboration with the band [[Panic! at the Disco]], the band released the single, "C'mon" with limited vinyl release.<ref>{{Cite web|title=We Need To Talk About Panic!

Their second album, ''[[Some Nights (album)|Some Nights]]'', was released on February 21, 2012, and featured production by [[Jeff Bhasker]]. The album's first single, "[[We Are Young]]", which features guest singer [[Janelle Monáe]], was released September 20, 2011. The song was covered on ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' in December 2011 and featured in a [[Chevy Sonic]] commercial during the Super Bowl in February 2012, and reached number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] on March 8, 2012. The album has become a success throughout the world, selling nearly three million copies.

On February 10, 2013, Fun. won a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] for their song "We Are Young". Upon receiving the Grammy, Ruess commented, "I don't know what I was thinking writing the chorus for this song. If this is in HD, everyone can see our faces, and we are not very young. We've been doing this for 12 years, and I just got to say we could not do this without the help of all the fans that we've had keeping us afloat for the last 12 years."<ref>{{cite web|first=Jocelyn|last=Vena|title=Fun.

Alongside Fun, Ruess had been a supporting vocalist for many different songs across genres. In 2012, he was featured on "Only Love" from [[Anthony Green (musician)|Anthony Green]]'s second solo album, ''[[Beautiful Things (album)|Beautiful Things]]'', and in 2013 was featured on [[Pink (singer)|Pink]]'s album, ''[[The Truth About Love (Pink album)|The Truth About Love]]'', in the song "[[Just Give Me a Reason]]". The song began as a simple songwriting session with [[Pink (singer)|Pink]]. She decided the song needed another side to it and subsequently a male part was written. While at first reluctant, with Pink encouraging him, he decided to participate in the duet.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Truth About Love – Track by Track Commentary|url=http://www.last.fm/music/P!nk/The+Truth+About+Love+-+Track+by+Track+Commentary}}</ref> The song eventually topped the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100, becoming his first number-one single as a solo artist and his second overall. After the success of "Just Give Me a Reason", Ruess was featured on [[Eminem]]'s eighth studio album ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP 2]]'' on the track "[[Headlights (Eminem song)|Headlights]]".  Many of Ruess' lyrics were borrowed from a previously unreleased track, "Jumping the Shark," written during the ''Aim and Ignite'' sessions.

In 2014, the band released the single "Sight of the Sun" for the [[HBO]] series, "[[Girls (TV series)|Girls]]" after being approached by show creator [[Lena Dunham]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sight Of The Sun by Fun. – Songfacts|url=https://www.songfacts.com/facts/fun/sight-of-the-sun|last=Songfacts|website=www.songfacts.com|language=en|access-date=May 27, 2020}}</ref>

On June 18, 2014, Fun debuted a new song on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]'' called "Harsh Lights". It would be the last new Fun song performed before Ruess' pursuing his career as a solo artist, however the band has made it clear that they are on hiatus, not splitting up.

===2014–present: Solo projects===
On February 5, 2015, Fun posted on their official website their status stating "there was no new Fun album in the works"; instead stating all three members were pursuing their own projects.

{{blockquote|Fun was founded by the three of us at a time when we were coming out of our own bands. One thing that has always been so special about Fun is that we exist as three individuals in music who come together to do something collaborative. We make Fun records when we are super inspired to do so. Currently Nate is working on his first solo album, Andrew is scoring films, and Jack is on tour and working on Bleachers music. The three of us have always followed inspiration wherever it leads us. Sometimes that inspiration leads to Fun music, sometimes it leads to musical endeavors outside of Fun. We see all of it as part of the ecosystem that makes Fun, fun.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ournameisfun.com/post/110131366776/a-message-from-nate-jack-andrew |title=Fun., A Message From Nate, Jack & Andrew |publisher=Ournameisfun.com |access-date=2015-06-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627151735/http://www.ournameisfun.com/post/110131366776/a-message-from-nate-jack-andrew |archive-date=June 27, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>}}

In an interview with Rolling Stone, Ruess added, "You get a little selfish about the songs that you write, and it's really hard to do that in a group setting, where there are two other people, and you have to think about everybody else's feelings. I'm writing and singing these songs about myself. When you work with producers versus bandmates, that line becomes a lot less blurry."<ref name="Montgomery"/>

In addition to his solo album, Ruess was invited to perform on [[Brian Wilson]]'s album ''[[No Pier Pressure]]''. Wilson, who co-founded [[the Beach Boys]], likened Ruess' voice to his deceased brother and former bandmate [[Carl Wilson]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fine|first1=Jason|title=Brian Wilson's Girl-Powered LP: In the Studio With the Beach Boy|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/brian-wilsons-girl-powered-lp-in-the-studio-with-the-beach-boy-20140718|publisher=Rolling Stone|access-date=July 18, 2014|date=July 18, 2014}}</ref> Ruess then contributed [[guest appearance|guest vocal]]s to the frequent collaborator [[Emile Haynie]]'s 2015 release, [[We Fall]].
