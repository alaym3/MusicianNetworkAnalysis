'''The Walkmen''' is an American [[indie rock]] band, with members based in [[New York City]] and [[Philadelphia]]. The band formed in 2000 with three members from [[Jonathan Fire*Eater]]—Paul Maroon (guitar, piano), [[Walter Martin (musician)|Walter Martin]] (organ/bass), and Matt Barrick (drums)—and two from [[The Recoys]], [[Peter Matthew Bauer|Peter Bauer]] (bass/organ)  and [[Hamilton Leithauser]] (vocals, guitar). Bauer attended [[Maret School]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], while the other band members attended [[St. Albans School (Washington, D.C.)|St. Albans]], also in Washington.

They prefer the sound of vintage musical instruments, particularly the [[upright piano]], and have often recorded at Marcata Recording, a [[recording studio]] built in [[Harlem]] in 1999 by the three former members of Jonathan Fire*Eater. A house engineer later relocated the band to [[upstate New York]].<ref name="marcata">{{cite web |url=http://www.marcata.net/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-01-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205062604/http://marcata.net/ |archive-date=2006-12-05 }} </ref>

The band is currently on hiatus, with Leithauser, Bauer and Martin all pursuing solo careers, and Barrick joining [[Fleet Foxes]] in a touring and session capacity. 

==History==

===Early years===
Each of the members of the Walkmen grew up in and around the [[Washington, DC]], area, played in many of the same bands from early in their careers,<ref name="yahoobio">{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/ar-282464-bio--The-Walkmen|title=The Walkmen Biography on Yahoo! Music|access-date=2009-02-17}}</ref> and even attended the same Washington-area high school, [[St. Albans School (Washington, D.C.)|St. Albans School]].<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A903700|title=BBC Collective - The Walkmen Interview|access-date=2009-02-17}}</ref> The bandmates eventually moved to Harlem.

The band was formed in 2000 following the breakup of two separate bands: [[Jonathan Fire*Eater]], whose members included Martin, Maroon and Barrick, and [[The Recoys]], whose members included Leithauser and Bauer.<ref name="yahoobio"/> The three members from Jonathan Fire*Eater, borrowed money from their family and friends to construct a rehearsal space in uptown [[New York City|New York]].<ref name="yahoobio"/><ref>{{Cite book|title=Meet Me in the Bathroom|last=Goodman|first=Lizzy|publisher=Dey Street/HarperCollins|year=2017|location=New York|pages=539–540}}</ref> The rehearsal space featured a 24-track recording studio and was dubbed ''Marcata Studios''.

The newly formed band, who wished to distance themselves from the [[garage rock]] sounds of previous bands, released a self-titled [[Extended play|EP]] of songs in 2001 on [[Startime International]], a small [[Brooklyn]]-based record label.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p508143|pure_url=yes}}|title=Allmusic Biography-The Walkmen|access-date=2009-02-18}}</ref> Shortly after the release of the EP, which featured a blend of upright pianos and other vintage instruments, the Walkmen made their official live debut with a performance at Joe's Pub in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]].

===''Everyone Who Pretended to Like Me Is Gone''===
The 2002 debut album ''[[Everyone Who Pretended to Like Me Is Gone]]'', released by [[Startime International|Startime]], was well received by critics.<ref name="pitchforkeveryonereview">{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8571-everyone-who-pretended-to-like-me-is-gone/|title=Pitchfork Media Review: Everyone Who Pretended to Like Me is Gone|last=Dahlen|first=Chris|date=April 8, 2002|access-date=2009-02-18}}</ref> The album was noted for its innovative approach to atmosphere and instrumentation, with sparse bass and drums complemented by plinking piano, jangly guitars and Leithauser's unique vocal stylings.<ref name="pitchforkeveryonereview"/> Two of the songs on the album, "The Blizzard of '96" and "That's the Punchline," were adaptations of tracks meant for [[The Recoys]]' unreleased full-length album.

Critics compared the results of the album to past work by [[U2]] and [[The Cure]] as a result of the uniqueness of its sound as compared to other contemporary New York City bands such as [[The Strokes]].<ref name="pitchforkeveryonereview"/> One of the album's songs, "We've Been Had," was featured in a commercial for a [[Saturn Ion]] automobile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.www.jhunewsletter.com/media/storage/paper932/news/2004/09/24/Arts/Featured.Events-2244552.shtml|title=N.Y.'s Walkmen rock in D.C. this Thursday|last=Yu|first=Stephanie|publisher=The Johns-Hopkins Newsletter|access-date=2009-02-18|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905021221/http://media.www.jhunewsletter.com/media/storage/paper932/news/2004/09/24/Arts/Featured.Events-2244552.shtml|archive-date=2009-09-05}}</ref>

===''A Hundred Miles Off'' and ''Pussy Cats''===
[[File:WalkmenConcert.jpg|thumb|right|The Walkmen performing in NYC in 2004]]
Their next album, ''[[A Hundred Miles Off]]'', was released in the U.S. on May 23, 2006. The band premiered most of the new songs on a tour of the Northeast in early 2006. The first [[single (music)|single]] to be released was "Louisiana," which featured an upbeat chorus of horns. Peter Bauer and Walter Martin traded [[musical instrument]]s on the new album, with Bauer handling the [[organ (music)|organ]] duties and Martin playing [[bass (guitar)|bass]].<ref name="pitchforkhundred">{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/36545-the-walkmen-a-hundred-miles-off|title=Pitchfork Media: A Hundred Miles Off Review|last=LeMay|first=Matt|access-date=2009-02-18|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126010502/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/36545-the-walkmen-a-hundred-miles-off|archive-date=2009-01-26}}</ref> The album found the band refocusing its sound toward folk sounds, unlike their previous two albums; though the change in direction was lauded by some critics,<ref name="rshundredreview">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thewalkmen/albums/album/10307980/review/10532947/a_hundred_miles_off|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023171332/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thewalkmen/albums/album/10307980/review/10532947/a_hundred_miles_off|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 23, 2006|title=Rolling Stone Review: A Hundred Miles Off|last=Hiatt|first=Brian|access-date=2009-02-18}}</ref> other reviews were often mixed.<ref name="pitchforkhundred"/>

The band was forced to close Marcata Studios that same year after [[Columbia University]] purchased the building it resided in.<ref name="marcata"/> The band released another full-length album, ''[[Pussy Cats (The Walkmen album)|"Pussy Cats" Starring the Walkmen]]'', a track-by-track cover of [[Harry Nilsson]] and [[John Lennon]]'s 1974 album ''[[Pussy Cats]]'', as a farewell to their studio's Harlem location.<ref name="marcata"/>

===''Lisbon''===
The Walkmen recorded 13 songs for their latest album in five days in August 2009 with John Congleton and [[Chris Zane]].

===''Heaven''===

Pitchfork announced that ''Heaven'' would be out on June 4 (Europe/UK) and on June 5 (US).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/45958-the-walkmen-announce-new-album/ |title=The Walkmen Announce New Album &#124; News |publisher=Pitchfork |date=2012-03-29 |access-date=2012-04-29}}</ref> It was completed in early March, as mentioned by the band on their website on March 7, 2012.  "Hi everyone. Our album is finally done and we're thrilled with it.  We can't wait to get it out there."<ref>[http://thewalkmen.com/home.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218202759/http://thewalkmen.com/home.html |date=February 18, 2012 }}</ref>

They released the song entitled "Heaven" to the public through Pitchfork Media's website on April 16, 2012, sparking the website to give the title "Best New Track" on the same day.

The Walkmen toured in early 2012 for their 10th anniversary of ''Everyone Who Pretended to Like Me Is Gone'', and during that tour they played many new songs.

They released their album, ''[[Heaven (The Walkmen album)|Heaven]]'', on May 29, 2012. Pitchfork rated it 8.1, and Stereogum called it the second best album of the year. [[American Songwriter]] says of the Walkmen that ''Heaven'' is "arguably their best, and certainly most accomplished album yet."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/05/the-walkmen-heaven/ |publisher=[[American Songwriter]] |title=The Walkmen: Heaven |access-date=12 August 2012}}</ref> Still in Rock gave the album a 7.8 rating and made a selection of the best tracks on the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stillinrock.com/2012/05/album-review-walkmen-heaven-indie-folk.html| title=The Walkmen, best titles by Still in Rock}}</ref>

The music video for the album's tenth track, "The Love You Love", was shot at the infamous [[Baleroy Mansion]] in Philadelphia by the band who was looking for a haunted site. 

The song "Heaven" was also used as the closing song on the series finale of the hit CBS show ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]''.

===Hiatus and future (2014–present)===
At the close of the band's tour for ''Heaven'', in December 2013, the band entered an extended hiatus.

In October 2020, Hamilton Leithauser was asked about the possibility of a Walkmen reunion during a [[Reddit]] [[r/IAmA|AMA]], to which he replied: "No plans right now, but I guess stranger things are happening every fifteen minutes right now... so you never know."<ref name="RedditAMA">{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/j6emst/greetings_world_this_is_hamilton_leithauser/|title=Hamilton Leithauser & Lucy Dacus AMA |work=[[Reddit]]|access-date=October 7, 2020}}</ref>
