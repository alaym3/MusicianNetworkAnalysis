'''TTNG''' (formerly known as '''This Town Needs Guns'''<ref name="cos">{{cite web|last=Kaye|first=Ben|date=22 January 2013|title=This Town Needs Guns change name to TTNG|url=https://consequence.net/2013/01/this-town-needs-guns-change-name-to-ttng/|access-date=14 October 2021|website=[[Consequence (publication)|Consequence]]}}</ref>) are a British [[rock music|rock]] band from [[Oxford]], formed in 2004, and currently signed to the American label [[Sargent House]] Records. Following numerous departures, the band went from being a four-piece to a trio, featuring Henry Tremain on [[bass rock|bass]] and [[lead vocals]], Tim Collis on [[guitar]] and his brother Chris Collis on [[drums]]. Their debut full-length album, ''[[Animals (This Town Needs Guns album)|Animals]]'', was released in the UK via [[Big Scary Monsters Recording Company]] in October of 2008 and shortly after in the US via [[Sargent House]] Records.<ref name="absolutepunk">{{cite web|last=Solomon|first=Blake|date=12 October 2008|title=This Town Needs Guns Interview|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=610192|archive-url=https://archive.is/0fQ1|archive-date=24 May 2012|access-date=14 October 2021|website=[[AbsolutePunk]]}}</ref> They have released four studio albums, as well as numerous EPs and singles.

==History==
The band formed in 2004 in [[Oxford]]. The original lineup consisted of Stuart Smith on rhythm guitar and vocals, Tim Collis on lead guitar, Simon Thompson on drums and Ian Lewis on bass. Thompson and Lewis left the band in 2005, to be replaced by Dan Adams on bass (replaced by Jamie Cooper after the recording of Animals in 2008) and Matt Bennington on drums (replaced by Chris Collis, brother of guitarist Tim, in 2006). In their earlier careers, bassist Jamie Cooper had worked as a graphic designer, drummer Chris Collis had been a librarian at the University of Oxford, guitarist Tim Collis was a primary school teacher, and lead vocalist Stuart Smith worked building websites for a publisher.<ref name=absolutepunk /> On 11 May 2011, it was announced on This Town Needs Guns' website that lead singer Stuart Smith would be leaving the band to start a family, and that he would be replaced by Pennines' singer and guitarist Henry Tremain. Bassist Jamie Cooper also left the band in late 2011 to focus on a career in graphic design. Tremain has since taken over on bass guitar duties, converting the band into a [[power trio]].

On 14 September 2012, the first track from the second album ''[[13.0.0.0.0]]'', entitled "Cat Fantastic" was released on digital streaming platforms.<ref>{{cite web|date=14 September 2012|title=Listen to 'Cat Fantastic'|url=http://thefourohfive.com/news/article/listen-to-cat-fantastic-the-first-single-from-this-town-needs-guns-new-album-405-exclusive|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215070622/https://www.thefourohfive.com/news/article/listen-to-cat-fantastic-the-first-single-from-this-town-needs-guns-new-album-405-exclusive|archive-date=15 February 2015|access-date=14 October 2021|website=[[The 405 (magazine)|The 405]]}}</ref> The album was released on 22 January 2013.

Their third album, ''Disappointment Island'', was released in July 2016.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dedman|first=Remfry|date=5 July 2016|title=TTNG – Disappointment Island: Exclusive Album Stream|website=[[The Independent]]|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/ttng-disappointment-island-exclusive-album-stream-a7119901.html|access-date=8 July 2016}}</ref>

In 2017, the whole band was arrested in Hong Kong during an immigration raid on the final show of their tour.

In July 2018, the band announced a 10-year anniversary tour of ''Animals,'' in which Smith would be returning to the band to play with them for the first time in seven years. In October of that year, an [[acoustic music|acoustic]] version of the album entitled ''Animals Acoustic '' was released.

== Musical style and influences ==
Over the years the band's musical style has progressed and changed, although the focal point of their style has been the guitar work of Tim Collis interspersed with, at points, highly complex drumming and sparse, melodic bass. Early releases however, featured more distorted chord progressions, as well as a strong focus on the interlinking melodies of both Collis and Smith's guitars. ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' describes the band's music as having "intricate pop guitar work, with a touch of jazz and Spanish influences".<ref>{{cite web|last=Hassett|first=Sebastian|date=25 July 2009|title=Pass the sugar|url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/pass-the-sugar-20090725-gdtnia.html|access-date=28 September 2009|website=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref> 

The band cites influences of other bands such as [[Owls (band)|Owls]], [[American Football (band)|American Football]] and [[Make Believe (band)|Make Believe]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Yates|first=Ben|last2=Price|first2=Toby|date=15 September 2008|title=DiScover: This Town Needs Guns|url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/3882204-discover--this-town-needs-guns|access-date=27 December 2008|website=[[Drowned in Sound]]}}</ref>

== Name change ==
With the release of ''[[13.0.0.0.0]]'' the band announced that they would be calling themselves TTNG. They stated that the name was ironic because guns are hardly present in their hometown of [[Oxford]], and the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in general. Now that the band is more known around the world, the name is no longer clearly ironic.<ref name="cos"/>
