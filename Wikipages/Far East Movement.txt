==Musical career==

===2003–2007: ''Folk Music''===
The three original members of Far East Movement, Kevin Nishimura (Kev Nish), James Roh (Prohgress), and Jae Choung (J-Splif), grew up in the [[Downtown Los Angeles]] area. They were close companions in high school and shared a passion for music together. The trio promoted their music online and began performing at local clubs and events in Los Angeles; soon, they began their musical career with the name "Emcees Anonymous" by 2001. However, they later changed it to Far East Movement or FM, originating from a song that they produced with the same name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://celebrityhighmag.com/mags/Dec_2010.pdf|title=celebrityhighmag.com|website=Go Daddy|access-date=March 19, 2018}}</ref> In 2003, they organised an event called "Movementality" in [[Koreatown, Los Angeles|Koreatown]], Los Angeles, featuring ten different performances with all the proceeds sent to a local youth drug rehabilitation center.

In 2005, Far East Movement released a mixtape called ''Audio-Bio'', which was one of their first CDs and contained many of their earliest songs and many songs not available anywhere else. Their first album, titled ''Folk Music'', was released in early 2006.<ref name="fm">{{cite web |url = http://cdbaby.com/cd/fareast3 |title = CD Baby: Far East Movement: Folk Music |access-date = May 22, 2009 |publisher = CD Baby |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090521103112/http://cdbaby.com/cd/fareast3 |archive-date = May 21, 2009 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> The single "Round Round" was featured in the film, ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]'', appearing both on the self-titled [[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] and video game.

Soon after, they planned on showcasing a second album, releasing ''Animal'' later on in the same year. ''Animal'' featured three hit singles that frequently won national radio play: “You’ve Got A Friend”, “Lowridin”, and the successful “Girls On The Dance Floor”. "Girls on the Dance Floor" reached 27 on the [[Billboard chart]] for the Latin Rhythm Airplay, which marked their debut on the Billboard's charts.<ref name="billboard">{{cite web |url = {{BillboardURLbyName|artist=far east movement|chart=Latin Rhythm Airplay}} |title = Top Music Charts |access-date =July 13, 2009 |work=Billboard}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Their two singles, "Girls on the Dance Floor" and "2 is Better w/ [[Ya Boy]]", garnered successful radio airplay.
