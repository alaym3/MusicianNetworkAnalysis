== Biography ==
Obie Trice III was born and raised on the west side of [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] by his mother, along with three brothers. He is of African-American and German descent. Trice was given a karaoke machine by his mother when he was eleven and he used it to rhyme over [[instrumental]]s from artists such as [[N.W.A]]. By the age of fourteen, he was attending rap battle gatherings around Detroit, including the Hip Hop Shop, where he and his friends would go on Saturday afternoons. The battles were hosted by [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]], from [[D12]]. Positive response from watchers encouraged Trice to get into rap music seriously."<ref name="Rolling Stone">Mark Binelli (September 10, 2003).

Trice was calling himself "[[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Obie 1]]" at that time, but before Proof introduced him at the Hip Hop Shop, he asked him his real name and introduced him as "Obie Trice", which remains his rap name.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/may/21/popandrock.eminem | title=Proof positive | work=The Guardian | date=May 21, 2006 | access-date=September 2, 2015}}</ref> Trice was introduced to [[Eminem]] through D12 member [[Bizarre (rapper)|Bizarre]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080222155525/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/obietrice/articles/story/5940089/hot_rapper_obie_trice Hot Rapper: Obie Trice].

Trice also featured on the track ''Hennessey'' on [[Tupac Shakur]]'s posthumous album [[Loyal To The Game]].

=== ''Second Round's on Me'' and shooting (2005–2007) ===
{{Main|Second Round's on Me}}
In 2005, Trice began work on his second album, entitled ''[[Second Round's on Me]]''. The album was released on August 15, 2006. Following the release of ''Second Round's on Me'', he released a mixtape called ''Bar Shots'' with [[G-Unit]]'s [[DJ Whoo Kid]].

Shortly after his label-mate [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]] was shot to death in a Detroit nightclub, a song emerged on the mixtape circuit called "Ride Wit Me". The song was dedicated to Proof. Trice made a speech at Proof's funeral, addressing the problem of black-on-black violence:

{{cquote|I want to talk to those coming up in the 'hood, coming up in the struggle. We're killing each other, and it's about nothing. Nothing. Nothing. We're all dying... over nothing.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1528973/20060419/proof_of_d_12.jhtml Eminem, Obie Trice Speak At Packed Funeral For Proof] MTV News (19 April 2006). Accessed 23 September 2007.</ref>}}

In the single "[[Cry Now]]" from his second album, Trice addresses his shooting, as well as Eminem's rumored retirement,<ref name="LiveDaily">Christina Fuoco (August 9, 2006). "[http://www.livedaily.com/news/10516.html LiveDaily Interview: Obie Trice] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216004311/http://www.livedaily.com/news/10516.html |date=2008-02-16 }}". LiveDaily.com. Accessed January 22, 2008.</ref> referenced with the following line, "Rock City is my voice / The white boy has stepped down / So I will accept the crown." Trice also addresses the shooting in the song "Pistol Pistol" from the album Eminem Presents: The Re-up claiming he's after revenge, "I solemnly swear on my daughters tears/The nigga that got him in the head will feel it before the year ends / Hope you inconspicuous my friend / `Cause once the word get back ya in a world of sin / Bullets will hurtle at him for tryin to murder what been determined as the first solo African " and later "I'm so sincere you seein' a hearse this year / it's not a verse it's curse for burstin' what's on ya person". He has since given insight as to why he feels the shooting occurred, and has labeled it "[[Hatred|haterism]]", as well as a bad mind state by saying, "it's a lot of do-or-die type individuals. They want to get that plug and there's really more to the game than they think it is [...] it's competition on a real vicious level."<ref name="XXL">Seth Berkman (July 2, 2007).

=== Departure from Shady Records (2008–2009) ===

Contrary to public belief at the time of the announcement, Trice did not have a falling out with Eminem or Dr. Dre. Both contributed vocals and production to Trice's upcoming album. A misunderstanding was made where it was believed he was attacking the label and Eminem on a single titled "The Giant"; however, this was quickly dismissed.<ref name="Obie departure">Tai Saint-Louis (June 30, 2008).
