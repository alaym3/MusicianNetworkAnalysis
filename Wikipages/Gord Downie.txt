They're writing all the music and I'm writing all the lyrics and we're coming up with some neat stuff. You do it for the company but I'm genuinely shocked by the themes and things you touch based on the music you're singing to. That's really compelling to me." The album consists of ten songs.<ref>{{cite news|last=Khanna|first=Vish|title=Gord Downie Sheds Light on Collaborative Album with the Sadies|url=http://exclaim.ca/News/Gord_Downie_Sheds_Light_on_Collaborative_Album_with_Sadies|access-date=30 March 2012|newspaper=Exclaim!}}</ref>

In February 2012 in [[Fort Albany, Ontario|Fort Albany]], [[Ontario]], Downie and the Tragically Hip played at the Great Moon Gathering, a yearly educational conference that takes place in various communities along Northern Ontario's [[James Bay]] coast.

Author [[Joseph Boyden]], who invited them, said their motivation was to "initiate a guerrilla act of love for a people who are so thoroughly underrepresented but now, somehow, overexposed for only their shortcomings. A guerrilla act of love to show the rest of the country what strength and artistry, grace and humour the Cree possess." In addition to the Tragically Hip's performance, Downie sang a song with a local band, Northern Revolution. The song "Goodnight Attawapiskat" from the album ''[[Now for Plan A]]'' was a result of this trip.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/08/24/gord-downie-and-the-hip-gone-fishin-in-northern-ontario.html|title=Gord Downie and the Hip gone fishin' in northern Ontario|first=Allan|last=Woods|publisher=The Toronto Star|date=2016-08-24|access-date=2017-10-18}}</ref>

{{quote
| quote = Last night Gord quietly passed away with his beloved children and family close by.

Gord knew this day was coming – his response was to spend this precious time as he always had – making music, making memories and expressing deep gratitude to his family and friends for a life well lived, often sealing it with a kiss&nbsp;... on the lips. Gord said he had lived many lives. As a musician, he lived "the life" for over 30 years, lucky to do most of it with his high school buddies. At home, he worked just as tirelessly at being a good father, son, brother, husband and friend. No one worked harder on every part of their life than Gord. No one.

We would like to thank all the kind folks at KGH and Sunnybrook, Gord’s bandmates, management team, friends and fans. Thank you for all the help and support over the past two years.

Thank you everyone for all the respect, admiration and love you have given Gord throughout the years – those tender offerings touched his heart and he takes them with him now as he walks among the stars.
