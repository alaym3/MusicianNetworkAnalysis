'''Sticky Fingers''' is an [[Indie rock]] band formed in 2008 in [[Sydney]]. The band consists of Dylan Frost (lead vocals/guitar), Paddy Cornwall (bass/vocals), Seamus Coyle (lead guitar), Beaker Best (drums/percussion) and Freddy Crabs (keys/synth). Former band member Taras Hrubyj-Piper (guitar/keyboards) left the band in 2009, shortly after their debut [[Extended play|EP]] ''Helping Hand'' was released.

They have released four studio albums: ''[[Caress Your Soul]]'' (2013), ''[[Land of Pleasure]]'' (2014), ''[[Westway (The Glitter & the Slums)|Westway (The Glitter & The Slums)]]'' (2016), and ''[[Yours to Keep (Sticky Fingers album)|Yours to Keep]]'' (2019) as well as three EP's: ''Helping Hand'' (2009), ''Extended Play'' (2010), and ''Happy Endings'' (2011). Their third album was the first album to debut and appear at number 1 on the [[ARIA Charts|Australian Albums Chart]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://themusic.com.au/news/all/2016/10/08/theyve-done-it-sticky-fingers-pick-up-1-aria-debut-over-bon-iver/|title=They've Done It: Sticky Fingers Pick Up #1 ARIA Debut Over Bon Iver|website=theMusic|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/3529586-Sticky-Fingers-9|title=Sticky Fingers (9)|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2018-05-20}}</ref>

On 5 December 2016 the band announced they would be going on an indefinite hiatus in February, due to several internal issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/sticky-fingers-on-indefinite-hiatus-after-frontman-accused-of-racial-abuse-20161206-gt4n0b.html|title=Sticky Fingers on indefinite hiatus after frontman accused of racial abuse|last=Bowden|first=Ebony|date=2016-12-05|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-05-20}}</ref> On 26 March 2018, the band announced their return via their instagram account.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bgw_YWtlpWw/|title=Sticky Fingers on Instagram: "Look who’s back."|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2018-05-20}}</ref>

==History==

=== 2008–2012: ''Helping Hand'', ''Extended Play'' and ''Happy Endings'' ===
The band was formed after Cornwall and Best saw Frost busking outside of the Coopers Hotel in [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/sticky-fingers-elbow-their-way-to-the-front-of-the-rocknroll-pack-20140916-10h0tv.html|title=Sticky Fingers elbow their way to the front of the rock'n'roll pack|last=Vincent|first=Peter|date=19 September 2014|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref>

In 2009, Sticky Fingers played their first live show and released their debut EP titled ''Helping Hand''. The EP showcases the early sound of Sticky Fingers which is mainly reggae driven, and includes the songs "Inspirational" and "Juicy Ones" which were later re-recorded for their ''Extended Play'' EP. The EP credits Taras Hrubyj-Piper for guitar and keyboard work, as well as Caroline De Dear and rapper Mute Mc for vocal work on the song "Lyrical Stoka".

Sticky Fingers released the ''Extended Play'' EP in October 2010 (through sureshaker), and the acoustic EP ''Happy Endings'' in October 2011.

After having their applications to play the Newtown Festival rejected on two consecutive occasions, in 2010, Sticky Fingers set up their own DIY stage in a friend's backyard nearby on the day of the festival. The renegade performance caught the attention of promoters, and notably, producer Dan Hume, who would go on to produce their next 3 records. Sticky Fingers also went on to headline Newtown Festival the next year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://producerhive.com/music-marketing-tips/viral-music-marketing-strategies/|title=6 Viral Music Marketing Hacks That Exploded These Artists' Success {{!}} |publisher=Producer Hive|date=3 December 2018|access-date=19 July 2019}}</ref>

=== 2012–2015: ''Caress Your Soul'' and ''Land of Pleasure'' ===
''[[Caress Your Soul]]'', the band's debut album (sureshaker), was released in March 2013 and reached number 39 in the [[ARIA Charts|Australian Albums Chart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Sticky%20Fingers%20%5BAU%5D&titel=Caress%20Your%20Soul&cat=a | title=Sticky Fingers - Caress Your Soul | website=Australian Charts Portal | publisher=Hung Medien | access-date=9 June 2016}}</ref> The band's second album ''[[Land of Pleasure]]'' reached number 3 on the Australian Albums Chart when it released in August 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Sticky%20Fingers%20%5BAU%5D&titel=Land%20Of%20Pleasure&cat=a | title=Sticky Fingers - Land of Pleasure | website=Australian Charts Portal | publisher=Hung Medien | access-date=9 June 2016}}</ref>

The band has not only gained popularity in Australia, but became popular in countries such as France, Germany, New Zealand, the Netherlands and the UK. The band postponed their 2015 European tour due to personal reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/sticky-fingers-cancel-all-remaining-european-tour-dates/|title=Sticky Fingers Cancel All Remaining European Tour Dates - Music Feeds|date=22 May 2015|website=Musicfeeds.com.au|access-date=9 June 2016}}</ref>

Their third album ''[[Westway (The Glitter & the Slums)]]'' was mostly recorded over the course of a month in Karma Sound Studios, Bang Saray, [[Thailand]] in early 2016 and was released on 30 September 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/media/s4497391.htm|title=The Avalanches, Sticky Fingers, Illy, Thundamentals, The Little Dum Dum Club {{!}} media {{!}} triple j|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=7 August 2016|access-date=13 August 2016}}</ref> Frost and Cornwall wrote the lyrics of the album and two songs, "Something Strange" featuring Australian rapper Remi and "Amillionite", were recorded in Sydney.

On 5 December 2016, the band announced through a [[Facebook]] post that they were going on an indefinite hiatus. Later that day, Dylan Frost posted a Facebook status on the band's page apologising for his behaviour and announcing he struggles with alcohol addiction and mental health issues. On 6 December 2016, an article published by ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' detailed further events leading to the hiatus. Frost was accused of being physically threatening to indigenous singer [[Thelma Plum]] after an incident at a Sydney pub where he reportedly spat on her.<ref>{{cite web|first1=Ebony|last1=Bowden|access-date=2019-03-20|title=Sticky Fingers on indefinite hiatus after frontman accused of racial abuse|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/sticky-fingers-on-indefinite-hiatus-after-frontman-accused-of-racial-abuse-20161206-gt4n0b.html|date=5 December 2016|website=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref>

On 30 March they played at Bad Friday, a neighborhood music festival held in Sydney's [[Inner West]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://instagram.com/stickyfingersband|title=Sticky Fingers Instagram|website=Instagram|access-date=15 May 2019}}</ref>

==Influences==
When asked where the band got their reggae vibe from, bassist Paddy Cornwall stated, Sydney 'Rock Steady Reggae got soul band 'King Tide' were [are] a huge influence on 'Sticky Fingers' opening for King Tide many times. Later on the band let King Tide open for them on their sold out run of Enmore Theatre gigs. That said, You know Dizza (Dylan) is rocking his Kiwi roots from Auckland, you know Seamus loves his rock 'n' roll, and me and Beaks just do our thing on the rhythm section."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktSF8kJN0Ww|title=Sticky Fingers interview at the Annandale Hotel|last=Music Feeds|date=4 July 2012|website=Youtube.com|access-date=9 June 2016|via=YouTube}}</ref> The band has stated their psychedelic reggae music has also been influenced by bands such as [[The Clash]], [[Pink Floyd]] and the [[Arctic Monkeys]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.wix.com/ugd/419075_e4cd7693c81f45b2bf4adb1b477b7ff9.pdf|title=Sticky Origins|format=PDF|website=Media.wix.com|access-date=9 June 2016}}</ref>

"A melting pot of reggae, psych and bourbon. Hypnotising you into a swaying trance, then punching you in the face for dancing like a hippy. Their borderline contradictory fusion of flavours speaks to every walk of life, and it's this multiplicity which makes the world their oyster."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stickyfingerstheband.com/#!bio/cfvg|title=Sticky Fingers - STIFI|website=Stickyfingerstheband/cp|access-date=9 June 2016}}</ref>
