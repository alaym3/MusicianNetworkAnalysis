==History==
===Origins===
The group's origins can be traced back to the early 1990s while the members were still attending school.  Alistaire McCalla and Xavier Davidson were friends, and McCalla recruited Craig Thompson and Roshaun Clarke who were fellow members of the choir at [[Campion College, Jamaica|Campion College]] in Kingston and T.O.K. was born.<ref>''Artistdirect Bio'' [http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/music/artist/bio/0,,1116738,00.html ''T.O.K. Biography''] 17 February 2009</ref>

After voicing some tracks for local record producer Stephen Greig's label Nuff Records, they signed a [[recording contract]] with [[Sly Dunbar]] and [[Robbie Shakespeare]]'s Taxi label in 1996, and released their first single, "Hit Them High", which had little impact.  Later that year, they signed onto Richard "Shams" Browne's High Profile label and released two more singles, "Send Them Come" and "Hardcore Lover" with [[Lady Saw]]. The latter tune was popular, climbing the Jamaican dancehall charts, and earned them a contract with [[VP Records]].<ref>''Allmusic bio'' [{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p472762/biography|pure_url=yes}} ''T.O.K. Biography''] 17 February 2009</ref> In 2012, the group became independent of their contract with VP Records.

===Commercial success===
Since emerging on the scene in the early 1990s, they released numerous hit songs and albums. In 1999, they recorded "Eagles Cry" (a version of [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s "[[When Doves Cry]]") on the Jamaican imprint Xtra Large, which became an international success.  "Eagles Cry" was followed closely by "Chi Chi Man", based on the "Sashi" [[riddim]] created by Tony "CD" Kelly and the christmas song [[Do You Hear What I Hear?]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2015/jamaicas-anti-gay-murder-music-carries-violent-message|title=Jamaica's Anti-Gay 'Murder Music' Carries Violent Message|last=Nelson|first=Leah|date=2011-02-27|work=Southern Poverty Law Center|access-date=2019-07-15|language=en}}</ref> It was the [[Jamaican Labour Party]]'s 2001 theme song, but came to be criticized for its homophobic lyrics ([[chi chi man]] being a slur for a gay man).<ref name=":0" /> T.O.K. entered the US market in 2001 with their debut album, ''My Crew, My Dawgs'', which made the [[Top 40|Top 10]] in the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Top Reggae Album Chart and achieved [[music recording sales certification|platinum]] status in Japan.  That year, T.O.K. appeared on [[MTV]]'s first ''Advance Warning''. The group had a further success with the single "Gal You A Lead".  The [[music video|video]] was selected for MTV2's ''New Faces of MTV2'', and was among ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'''s "Top Songs of 2004". Produced by [[Bobby Konders]], the single reached No. 85 in the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

Their second album, ''Unknown Language'' (2005) produced another hit "Footprints",<ref name="Kenner" /> also making it into the Billboard Chart at No. 93.  The album followed its predecessor with platinum sales in Japan. T.O.K. spent a couple of years [[concert tour|touring]] the world promoting ''Unknown Language''.

In 2007, two more hits emerged in "No Man" and "Guardian Angel". "Guardian Angel" rose to No. 1 on the Reggae Charts in New York City and Florida as well as in Jamaica. Since 2008, T.O.K. released several new singles, as well as music videos for "No Man", "Unbelievable", the "Hotta Vybez Medley", "Raindrops Medley" and more recently "Supermodel".

In August 2009, their third album, ''[[Our World (album)|Our World]]'' was released, with collaborations from [[Beenie Man]] and [[Kelly Price]].

In 2013 the group collaborated with [[Major Lazer]] on the single "Shell It Down", which incorporated [[Electronic dance music|EDM]].<ref name="CampbellC">Campbell, Curtis (2014) "[http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20140713/ent/ent3.html T.O.K.

===Break-up===

===Criticism===
T.O.K. was one of the musical acts that the [[Stop Murder Music]] campaign targeted. Their song "Chi Chi Man" was controversial for its lyrics which advocated for the killing of gay men.<ref>[http://www.soulrebels.org/dancehall/u_lyrics_chi.htm]</ref> T.O.K. refused to sign the [[Reggae Compassion Act]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jamaica-star.com/thestar/20070629/ent/ent1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406133446/http://jamaica-star.com/thestar/20070629/ent/ent1.html |archivedate=6 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> but drafted and signed their own contract in August 2009 before their performance in [[Zurich]] called the T.O.K.
