==History==
Corporate Thugz released its first album in 2001, [[Young Jeezy]]'s ''[[Thuggin' Under the Influence (T.U.I.)]]'', followed by ''[[Come Shop wit Me]]''. In 2005, Young Jeezy got a deal with [[Def Jam South]] and [[The Island Def Jam Music Group|The Island Def Jam]] and released his 1st major label studio album ''[[Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101]]''. Then in 2006 he released his 2nd major label studio album ''[[The Inspiration]]'' and in 2007 formed the rap group [[United Streets Dopeboyz of America]] (USDA) and signed [[Slick Pulla]], [[Blood Raw]], 211, JW and Boo Rossini to Corporate Thugz and released his label's 3rd studio album and USDA's debut studio album ''[[Young Jeezy Presents USDA: Cold Summer]]''. In 2008 [[Young Jeezy]] released ''[[The Recession]]''.

In 2011, Young Jeezy signed [[Freddie Gibbs]], [[Tone Trump]], and [[Scrilla]] to Corporate Thugz. Freddie Gibbs left Corporate Thugz in late 2012, and after leaving the label Gibbs said "Anything he (Young Jeezy) tells you is fake." This laid the groundwork for Gibbs's album ''[[ESGN]]'' and the diss records directed at Jeezy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/06/freddie-gibbs-blasts-young-jeezy-says-anything-he-tells-you-its-going-to-be-fake/ |title=Freddie Gibbs Blasts Young Jeezy, Says "Anything He Tells You, It's Going To Be Fake" - XXL |publisher=Xxlmag.com |date=2013-06-10 |access-date=2013-10-06}}</ref> On New Year's Eve 2012 Scrilla announced that he had asked for and received his release from Corporate Thugz, and that there were no hard feelings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.22381/title.scrilla-says-hes-leaving-young-jeezys-cte-imprint|title=Scrilla Says He's Leaving Young Jeezy's CTE Imprint|author=HipHopDX|date=31 December 2012|work=HipHopDX|access-date=5 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055427/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.22381/title.scrilla-says-hes-leaving-young-jeezys-cte-imprint|archive-date=21 September 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> First action in the new imprint deal with Atlantic, Craig Kallman and Jeezy named Steven "Steve-O" Carless as A&R of Atlantic and President of Corporate Thugz.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6236431/young-jeezy-posts-bail|title=Young Jeezy Posts Bail|website=Billboard.com|access-date=1 November 2017}}</ref> In early 2013 Young Jeezy signed Detroit hip hop group Doughboyz Cashout<ref name="DBC signs to CTE">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1707459/young-jeezy-signs-doughboyz-cashout-cte.jhtml |title=Young Jeezy Signs 'Ghetto Superstars' Doughboyz Cashout To CTE: Watch Now! - Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV.com |date=2013-05-16 |access-date=2013-06-10}}</ref> and later that year West Coast rapper [[YG (rapper)|YG]] was added to the record label.<ref name="YG signs to CTE">{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/06/yg-announces-that-hes-signing-to-young-jeezys-cte |title=YG Young Jeezy CTE |publisher=Complex |date=2013-06-18 |access-date=2013-10-06}}</ref> On August 13, 2013, the label released a compilation mixtape featuring Jeezy, Doughboyz Cashout, and YG titled ''[[Boss Yo Life Up Gang]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/08/young-jeezy-to-release-compilation-mixtape/ |title=Young Jeezy To Release Compilation Mixtape - XXL |publisher=Xxlmag.com |date=2013-08-06 |access-date=2013-10-06}}</ref> The mixtape was supported by the singles "[[My Nigga]]" by YG and "Mob Life" by Doughboyz Cashout, both featuring Young Jeezy.
