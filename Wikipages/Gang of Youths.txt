===2011–2012: Formation===
[[File:Gang of Youths (24163959477).jpg|thumb|left|Le'aupepe performing with Gang of Youths in 2017]]
Gang of Youths was formed in Sydney, Australia in 2011, with original drummer Sam O'Donnell.<ref name="Mordue">{{cite news | url = https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/culture/music/2015/09/05/gang-youths-difficult-positions/14413752002336 | title = Gang of Youths' Difficult Positions | last = Mordue | first = Mark | work = The Saturday Paper | publisher = Schwartz Media | date = 5 September 2015 | access-date = 15 December 2015 }}</ref> Le'aupepe and original lead guitarist Joji Malani first met in 2002, both aged 10, attending [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong]], an evangelical church in northern Sydney. In subsequent years they befriended O'Donnell and Chicago-born Kim at the church's youth group. Although Le'aupepe described himself during this time as a 'loner'<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fasterlouder.junkee.com/track-by-track-gang-of-youths-the-positions/843095|title=Track by Track: Gang Of Youths - 'The Positions' - FasterLouder|website=FasterLouder|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-12}}</ref> and stated that while "I still align myself with Jesus," he was "just not a great poster-boy for it."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/features/gang-youths-david-leaupepe-talks-jesus-blackface-new-music-life-lonely-millenial/#YgsVWw1L3wABOUOD.99|title=Gang Of Youths' David Le'aupepe Talks Jesus, Blackface, New Music & Life As A Lonely Millennial - Music Feeds|website=Music Feeds|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-12}}</ref> In 2008, after leaving his previous school, Le'aupepe started attending the more prestigious [[Mosman High School]], where he continued performing his own songs at school concerts, along with Harley Streten (soon to be known as [[Flume (musician)|Flume]]). Also at Mosman High was Kiwi Max Dunn, who befriended Le'aupepe during their final year of high school in 2009.

The band's first gig was at Sydney's Hibernian House on 21 June 2012, supporting local band Tigertown. Tigertown's drummer Kurt Bailey was so impressed with the performance he soon became their manager. For the next 5 months the band practiced and recorded some demos until their next gig in late December of that year. They started playing regular support gigs in small Sydney venues and local community station [[FBi Radio]] began playing some of their demos, including "A Sudden Light" and "Strange Diseases". Word started filtering out about their impressive live show and on 27 February 2013 they played their first headline show, at the re- opening of Sydney nightclub Candy's Apartment. They released their first single "Evangelists" on 16 August 2013 and were featured on national youth station [[Triple J]]'s Unearthed segment. They then embarked on a national tour, supporting [[Cloud Control]].

===2013–2016: ''The Positions'' and ''Let Me Be Clear''===
