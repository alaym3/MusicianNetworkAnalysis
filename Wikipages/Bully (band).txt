'''Bully''' is the solo project of guitarist and singer Alicia Bognanno. The American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 2013 in [[Nashville]]. They signed to Columbia Records label Startime International and released their first album ''[[Feels Like]]'' in 2015, then moved to [[Sub Pop]] to release ''[[Losing (album)|Losing]]'' in 2017. Their third album ''Sugaregg'' was released on August 21, 2020. What initially began as a three-piece band is now a solo project with accompanying members.

==Background==
Bully was founded by [[Rosemount, Minnesota]] native Alicia Bognanno, who earned a degree from [[Middle Tennessee State University]] in audio recording before getting an internship at [[Steve Albini]]'s Electrical Audio studios in [[Chicago]].<ref name="Deming">Deming, Mark "[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bully-mn0001570441/biography Bully Biography]", [[Allmusic]]. Retrieved June 27, 2015</ref> She started recording demos of her own material before relocating to Nashville, Tennessee, where she worked as an engineer at Battle Tapes Recording and The Stone Fox venue.<ref name="Deming" /> She formed the band with Stewart Copeland on drums (not to be confused with the drummer for The Police).<ref name="Deming" />

After self-releasing a limited cassette, the band's first single proper, "Milkman", was released in April 2014. They signed with [[Columbia Records]] label Startime International and released their debut album ''[[Feels Like]]'' in June 2015.<ref name="Deming" /> 

''[[Feels Like]]'' received generally positive reviews from critics. Laura Snapes of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' wrote, "The coarse [[Kurt Cobain|Cobain]] head-scream of Bully singer, songwriter, and guitarist Alicia Bognanno is its own resuscitating jolt of protest... she spends much of ''[[Feels Like]]'' tearing down the house with her howl."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20484-bully-feels-like/|title=Bully: Feels Like Album Review|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|last=Snapes|first=Laura|date=June 25, 2015|accessdate=August 21, 2020}}</ref>

''[[Losing (album)|Losing]]'', Bully's second studio album, was released by [[Sub Pop]] on October 20, 2017. The album was recorded at [[Electrical Audio]] in Chicago. It was called less "grimier and sugar-slick" than ''Feels Like''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bully: Losing|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bully-losing/|access-date=2021-01-06|website=Pitchfork|language=en}}</ref>

On May 1, 2020, Bully released covers of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s "[[About a Girl (Nirvana song)|About a Girl]]" and [[Orville Peck]]'s "Turn to Hate". Of the "About a Girl" cover, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' stated "Hearing the Nashville band cover [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] is almost too obvious—but, good God, is it glorious. Their spin on 1989's '[[About a Girl (Nirvana song)|About a Girl]]' strikes a perfect balance of raw and melodic, without ever sounding like the output of a cover band...Still, it's not just a skilled copy of a classic."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/bully-nirvana-about-a-girl-992927/|title=Song You Need to Know: Bully Covers Nirvana's 'About a Girl'|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|last=Ehrlich|first=Brenna|date=May 1, 2020|accessdate=August 21, 2020}}</ref> As for her take on "Turn to Hate", ''[[Stereogum]]'' wrote "A song that sounds incredible in Bully's rocket-fueled garage rock style."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/2083053/bully-about-a-girl-nirvana-turn-to-hate-orville-peck/music/|title=Bully Cover Nirvana & Orville Peck: Listen|website=[[Stereogum]]|last=DeVille|first=Chris|date=May 1, 2020|accessdate=August 21, 2020}}</ref> ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' concurred that "Bully's rendition is possibly even better than the original with its incredibly anthemic chorus."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/music/bully/bully-cover-nirvana-orville-peck/|title=Hear Bully Cover Nirvana's "About a Girl" and Orville Peck's "Turn to Hate"|work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|last=Manno|first=Lizzie|date=May 1, 2020|accessdate=August 21, 2020}}</ref>

On June 11, 2020, Bully announced their third record ''Sugaregg'', which was released by Sub Pop on August 21, 2020. Bognanno paid homage to [[Chumbawamba]]'s 1997 song "[[Tubthumping]]" when writing the single "Where to Start",<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ehrlich|first=Brenna|date=2020-06-11|title=Bully Drops Chumbawamba-Inspired 'Where to Start,' Teases New Album|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/bully-sugaregg-1012982/|access-date=2020-07-15|website=Rolling Stone}}</ref> which was met with positive reception. On the album's second single "Every Tradition", Bognanno addresses society's expectations for women, while also targeting a specific unnamed individual.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-07-08|title=Bully are ready to tear apart "Every Tradition": Stream|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/07/bully-are-ready-to-tear-apart-every-tradition-stream/|access-date=2020-07-15|website=[[Consequence of Sound]]}}</ref> In an interview with the New York Times published on August 18, 2020, Bognanno discussed the record, as well her bipolar II disorder as well as the experience of ''Sugaregg'' being her first solo project.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Zoladz|first=Lindsay|date=2020-08-18|title=Bully’s Alicia Bognanno Is Revealing Herself, One Rock Song at a Time|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/18/arts/music/bully-sugaregg.html|access-date=2021-01-06|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>
