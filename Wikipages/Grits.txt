Grits is similar to other thick maize-based [[porridge]]s from around the world, such as [[polenta]] and [[Pap (food)|mieliepap]]. In the Charleston, South Carolina area, cooked grits is called "hominy" and uncooked grits is called "grist."<ref>Huguenin, Mary Vereen and Stoney, Anne Montague, eds. Charleston Receipts. The Junior League of Charleston:1950. P. 153</ref>  The word "grits" is derived from the [[Old English]] word {{lang|ang|[[Grit (grain)|grytt]]}}, meaning "coarse meal".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Harper |first=Douglas |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=grits |access-date=August 27, 2011 |title=grits |work=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref>

== Origin ==
The dish originated with the Native American Muscogee tribe using a corn similar to hominy.<ref>http://deepsouthmag.com/2014/10/01/shrimp-and-grits-a-history/</ref> American colonists learned to make the dish from the Native Americans, and it quickly became an American staple.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Wulff|first=Alexia|title=A Brief History Of Grits|url=https://theculturetrip.com/north-america/usa/articles/a-brief-history-of-grits/|access-date=2021-07-31|website=Culture Trip}}</ref>

At that time, the hominy for grits was ground on a stone [[mill (grinding)|mill]]. The ground hominy was then passed through screens, the finer sifted material used as grit meal, and the coarser as grits.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Newsday, Melville, N.Y., Burning Questions column: Kernels of Truth on Ground Corn|last=Marcus|first=Erica|date=3 May 2006|work=Knight Ridder Tribune Business News|location=Washington|page=1|via=ProQuest}}</ref>
