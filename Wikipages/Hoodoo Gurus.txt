===Stoneage Romeos (1983–1984)===

Gurus new line-up (Baker, Bramley, Faulkner and Shepherd) recorded the band's first album in 1984, ''[[Stoneage Romeos]]''.<ref name="OzRockDb"/> The title came from a 1955 [[Three Stooges]] [[List of Three Stooges shorts|short]] ''[[Stone Age Romeos]]''. The album was dedicated to characters from ''[[Get Smart]]'', ''[[F-Troop]]'' and ''[[Petticoat Junction]]''.<ref name="McF"/> They were awarded 'Best Debut Album' of 1984 at the July 1985 ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'' Music Awards.<ref name="Count85">{{cite web |url=http://www.countdownmemories.com/magazines/jul85/jul85p59.jpg |work=Countdown Magazine |date=July 1985 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC-TV]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108035929/http://www.countdownmemories.com/magazines/jul85/jul85p59.jpg |archive-date=8 November 2007 |title=July 1985 picture |url-status=dead |access-date=11 January 2013 }}</ref> When ''Stoneage Romeos'' was released in America it stayed at number 1 in the Alternative/College charts for seven weeks, becoming one of the most played albums for the year on the college network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theharbouragency.com/artist-profile/hoodoo-gurus |title=Hoodoo Gurus |publisher=The Harbour Agency |access-date=19 February 2008 }}</ref>

Initially a cult inner-city act, their popularity expanded due to regular airplay on radio station [[Triple J]] and nationwide pop TV show ''Countdown'' from mid-1983. Their breakthrough single "[[My Girl (Hoodoo Gurus song)|My Girl]]" was accompanied by a video clip featuring a dog trainer with his once champion [[greyhound]]. Members of [[Spiderbait]] described seeing the video for the first time as "a beautiful, classic pop song".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~juliat/hg/stoneagecameos.html |title=Stoneage Cameos |publisher=Julia Thiel |access-date=14 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808043129/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~juliat/hg/stoneagecameos.html |archive-date=8 August 2007 }}</ref> Some viewers insisted the song was "written about a dog".<ref name="Pop" /> This was closely followed by "[[I Want You Back (Hoodoo Gurus song)|I Want You Back]]", which featured [[Stop motion|animated]] plastic model [[dinosaur]]s.

=== From Mars to Kinky (1985–1993) ===
Following the US tour the Hoodoo Gurus went into the studio and recorded their second album, ''[[Mars Needs Guitars!]]'' (1985). The title was a twist on a [[Sci Fi]] [[B movie]] titled ''[[Mars Needs Women]]''. The album's first single, "[[Bittersweet (Hoodoo Gurus song)|Bittersweet]]", had a more subdued regular-looking video.  The Hoodoo Gurus played Europe and the United States including sell-out shows at [[London]]'s [[Hammersmith Palais]] and a two-month tour as special guests with [[The Bangles]].<ref name="Adams"/><ref name="Pop"/>

Baker's firing upset some fans and critics. Despite subsequent fan speculation about the single "[[Poison Pen (song)|Poison Pen]], songwriter Faulkner said it was not about band issues but rather about a relationship that had turned bitter.<ref name="Pop"/> Baker had been involved with [[The Beasts of Bourbon]] as a side project from 1983<ref name="Hollow"/> and now concentrated on their 1984 album ''The Axeman's Jazz'', subsequently he founded James Baker Experience and [[Dubrovniks|The Dubrovniks]] (latter two included Radalj), Novakill and eventually The Painkillers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Australian Rock Database entry on James Baker |publisher=Magnus Holmgren |date=23 September 2006 |url=http://hem.passagen.se/honga/database/b/bakerjames.html |access-date=24 November 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213162550/http://hem.passagen.se/honga/database/b/bakerjames.html |archive-date=13 February 2008 }}</ref>

Gurus' peak of popularity was in the mid-to-late 1980s with the albums ''[[Mars Needs Guitars!]]'', ''[[Blow Your Cool!]]'' and ''[[Magnum Cum Louder]]''.<ref name="Adams"/> The albums reached no.&nbsp;140 (1986), no.&nbsp;120 (1987) and no.&nbsp;101 (1989) on the American [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album charts respectively.<ref name="Billboard Albums">{{cite web |title=Billboard Artist Chart History – Hoodoo Gurus |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=hoodoo gurus|chart=all}} |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=11 February 2008 }}</ref> The band's 1987 'Blow Your Cool' concert tour took them to 19 countries playing 204 venues. A concert from the Ritz in New York City was broadcast by [[MTV]] America. The 'Magnum Cum Louder' tour in 1990, with dates in Europe, America and Australasia; included Japan for the first time. Based on their extensive touring of America, the band gained a solid following in the U.S. with regular exposure on US college radio (and later [[MTV]]'s [[120 Minutes]]) and even developed a big fan base in [[Brazil]].<ref name="HoF"/><ref name="Pop"/> The third album ''Blow Your Cool!'' let go of some of the peripheral quirkiness and just concentrated on the band's pop power. Members of their international peer group [[The Bangles]] and [[Dream Syndicate]] contributed backing vocals to some songs.  Then, Hoodoo Gurus decided to opt out of its record contract, tying up the group in legal wranglings for more than a year.

{{quote|The Persian Rugs was me doing a complete '60s revival sort of thing.  Also, in a funny way, it was my own sort of version of retaliating at all the critics who always harped on the Gurus' '60s influences: "You want to hear what I do when I do '60s? Here it is!" But I also had a whole lot of songs after the Gurus broke up, and though I rehearsed them with different musicians, they just couldn't seem to get the flavor of what I was trying to do. It became obvious to me that there was only one band that could play these songs the way I wanted to hear them. So ''Mach Schau'', far from us coming back and being "middle aged" and writing for an older fan base, we just wanted to make a hard rocking record that out-did anything we'd ever done. We really blew a gasket on that one—it's our ''Presence'', like Led Zeppelin.|Dave Faulkner|<ref name="Harp"/>}}

In April 2012 the band played a series of concerts titled Dig it Up! in Australian capital cities, to celebrate 30 years since the release of their debut single "[[Leilani (song)|Leilani]]". At the concerts, the band performed the whole of their debut album ''[[Stoneage Romeos]]'' and other hits. Also playing as part of the Dig It Up! tour were Australian bands [[Died Pretty]] and [[The Hard Ons]], as well as international bands such as [[Redd Kross]], [[The Sonics]] and [[The Fleshtones]].

In April 2013, the band hosts the [http://digitup.net.au/flamin-groovies-shake-some-action/ 2nd Dig It Up] invitational concerts across the Australian capital cities, performing Mars Needs Guitars, and will be joined by [[Blue Öyster Cult]], [[Flamin' Groovies]], [[Buzzcocks]], and [[Peter Case]]. 2014 saw the release of ''[[Gravy Train (EP)|Gravy Train]]'', an EP featuring three new songs and a remake of their first single "Leilani".

In January 2015, it was announced that Kingsmill would be retiring from the band.  His last performances were on 22 and 23 May 2015, at the "Be My Guru – Evolution Revolution" concerts at Sydney's [[Powerhouse Museum]], performed as the opening to the city's annual [[Vivid Sydney|Vivid Festival]].  The concerts reunited all eight past and present band members for a two-hour set covering their beginnings as Le Hoodoo Gurus in 1982 all the way through to 2010's ''Purity of Essence''.

The band headlined the 'A Day on the Green' concert series in March 2016, with [[Sunnyboys]], [[Violent Femmes]], [[Died Pretty]], and [[Ratcat]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://themusic.com.au/news/all/2015/10/15/hoodoo-gurus,-sunnyboys-and-more-lead-a-day-on-the-green-announce/|title=/|website=The Music}}</ref>

In early 2018, the group announced a vinyl reissue campaign called the Hoodoo Gurus Record Club, entailing the reissue on coloured vinyl of their back catalogue up to ''Purity of Essence'', which also included the album the group recorded as the Persian Rugs in 2000. The first release through the campaign was ''Stoneage Romeos'' on 1 June 2018, with a general public release on 7 September.

On 26 May 2018, the group held a benefit concert for the [[2018 Tathra bushfire|Tatra bushfire]] with artists [[The Badloves]], [[1927 (band)|1927]] and local talents Daniel Champagne, Corey Legge, The Figmentz, Erin McMahon, and [[Melanie Horsnell]].
