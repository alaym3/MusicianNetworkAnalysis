'''Set It Off''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 2008 in [[Tampa, Florida]]. The band initially gained a large following through vocalist Cody Carson's YouTube channel. Their following took on the name "143 family" later to be known as "Dreamcatchers". Set It Off was subsequently signed by [[Equal Vision Records]] after releasing a string of successful extended plays. In 2018 they signed to [[Fearless Records]], and in February 2019 the band released ''Midnight'', their fourth studio album, through the label.

==History==

===Formation (2008)===  
Cody Carson met Dan Clermont in high school, as both were in the marching band. [[Austin Kerr|Austin M. Kerr]] and Zach DeWall were in their own band together prior to the formation of Set It Off. The two bands brushed against each other while playing local shows, occasionally at the same time. After high school, Carson left for Ohio to attend the [[Oberlin Conservatory of Music]] as a classical clarinet student. In his first year, after exchanging a series of [[YouTube]] videos with [[All Time Low]]'s frontman Alex Gaskarth, Carson asked if he could sing "Coffee Shop Soundtrack" on stage at the group's upcoming concert at the Cleveland House of Blues via a [[YouTube]] video,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjhOQieDBWA|title=Alex, Please watch this and respond with an answer :-D|date=March 27, 2008|work=YouTube}}</ref> to which Gaskarth agreed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7mAnhGtitw|title=YouTube|work=youtube.com}}</ref> The performance helped Carson confirm his dream of starting a rock band,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cltampa.com/tampa/cody-carson-on-his-buzzed-about-band-set-it-off/Content?oid=2307423#.UFcuUo5Rc0s|title=Cody Carson on his buzzed-about band, Set It Off|work=Creative Loafing Tampa}}</ref> and not long afterwards, Carson dropped out of college and used his school money to come back and start up the band.

DeWall and Kerr were amongst the first to join the band, and Dan Clermont also followed. James Arran was Set It Off's initial drummer, but financial struggles made gas purchases difficult for him, which resulted in Arran resigning on August 24, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iSTyMKW5JJs |title=Clarissa explains it all|date=August 26, 2008|work=YouTube}}</ref> Blake Howell became Set It Off's next drummer but soon left the band due to difficulties his family was facing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Wky4gdXxhAo |title=Importante Por Favor....Gato! (Present for you on Halloween)|date=October 30, 2008|work=YouTube}}</ref> Howell was replaced by Benjamin Panico (a.k.a. Benji Panic) on October 30, 2009; however, he and the band have since parted ways so that Panico could pursue his GED and later start his own photography studio. Howell was able to introduce the band to their current drummer, Maxx Danziger. Dan Clermont, the bands lead guitar player, officially left the band in 2019 due to family troubles.

I loved being able to turn to songs that I could personally relate to. I want to provide that same kind of coping source for people. I want people to be able to turn on ''Horrible Kids'' and pick a song that pinpoints exactly what they're going through and allows them to vent through it."<ref name="altpress_a" />

===''Cinematics'' (2013–2014)===
[[File:Set It Off - VWT 2013.jpg|thumbnail|right|Band performing (2013) at [[Warped Tour]]]]

In July 2012, Set It Off announced the release of its debut full-length album [[Cinematics (album)|''Cinematics'']], released that same year. A deluxe version was released on September 18, 2012.

The band partnered with [[VH1|VH1 Save the Music Foundation]] and donated $1 of every album sold before September 23 to help support music programs in schools. The band also added their own bonus to the donation, creating a total of $5,000 directly from the band. Equal Vision Records agreed to match the band's donation amount if the band reached No. 1 on the Billboard Heatseekers Chart.

Cody Carson highly praised the organization's goals, stating, "We're honored to be working with VH1 Save The Music. If it wasn't for the music education program in my high school, Set It Off would not exist. I would not have met our guitarist, Dan Clermont, I wouldn't have been directed toward Oberlin Music Conservatory, and I wouldn't end up with even half of the musical knowledge I possess now. More people need to be able to experience the unity, leadership skills, and work ethic taught by being involved in music education programs in schools. Set It Off strongly endorses this organization for these, among many other, reasons. We're so excited to raise money for them and help spread the word about the importance of music education."<ref>{{cite web|title=Equal Vision Records Tumblr|url=http://blog.equalvision.com/post/29429227451/set-it-off-to-donate-funds-and-raise-awareness|publisher=Equal Vision Records}}</ref>

The album, which was produced, mixed and recorded by Zack Odom and Kenneth Mount at ZK Productions, debuted at the No. 174 position on the ''Billboard'' 200, No. 4 on the Top Heatseekers, and No. 38 on the Independent Albums chart.

==Musical style and influences==
During Set It Off's early years the band fit into the pop-punk genre exclusively. Their debut album Cinematics (2012) featured orchestral elements, whereas its follow-up Duality (2014) was influenced by 1990s/2000s pop music. The band continued to progress in this direction with a third studio album Upside Down (2016) which featured some of the band's poppiest output yet.

The majority of the orchestral string sounds are programmed and sequenced [[synthesizers]] added during production rather than traditionally recorded acoustic instruments. In 2015, [[Kerrang!|''Kerrang!'' magazine]] summarized the band's genre as [[pop rock]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Kerrang! Rock Chart |magazine=[[Kerrang!]] |date=January 17, 2015 |issue= 1551 |page=10 |quote=Making their debut on the Rock Chart this week, it's the Florida pop-rockers [Set It Off].}}</ref>

Back in January 2019, Cody Carson posted an [https://www.reddit.com/r/poppunkers/comments/ajiq97/hey_there_im_cody_carson_from_set_it_off_and_me/ Ask Me Anything] on Reddit where he answered fans questions regarding their band. One person asked what inspired their band name to which he responded "Fall Out Boy song, IIRC. Calm Before The Storm," referring to one of the lyrics in said song.
