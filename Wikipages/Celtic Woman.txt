Downes chose a repertoire that ranged from traditional [[Celtic music|Celtic tunes]] to modern songs.

The show was meant to be a one-time event held in [[Dublin]], Ireland, but multiple airings on [[PBS]] helped boost the group's popularity.

The group's line-up has changed over the years. Fourteen albums have been released under the name "Celtic Woman": ''[[Celtic Woman (album)|Celtic Woman]]'', ''[[Celtic Woman: A Christmas Celebration]]'', ''[[Celtic Woman: A New Journey]]'', ''[[Celtic Woman: The Greatest Journey]]'', ''[[Celtic Woman: Songs from the Heart]]'', ''[[Celtic Woman: Lullaby]]'', ''[[Celtic Woman: Believe]]'', ''[[Celtic Woman: Home for Christmas]]'', ''[[Celtic Woman: Emerald - Musical Gems]]'', ''[[Celtic Woman: Destiny]]'', ''[[Celtic Woman: Voices of Angels]]'', ''[[Celtic Woman: Ancient Land]]'', ''Celtic Woman: The Magic of Christmas'', and ''[[Postcards from Ireland|Celtic Woman: Postcards from Ireland]]''.

On 12 August 2018, it was announced that McFadden, expecting her first child, was taking a leave from the group. On 16 August 2018, [[Megan Walsh]] was announced as a new member of the group, taking McFadden's place.<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/celticwoman/photos/a.164250352837/10156604105012838/?type=3|title=Celtic Woman|website=facebook.com|access-date=17 August 2018}}{{Primary source inline|date=January 2020}}</ref> In October 2019, [[Susan McFadden]] returned for a few shows on the group's European Tour while [[Mairéad Carlin]] recovered from appendicitis.

On 22 January 2020, it was announced that [[Éabha McMahon]] was taking a leave from the group to pursue her own projects. [[Chloë Agnew]] returned to the group for the US Celebration tour to take McMahon's place for the majority of the tour, and [[Susan McFadden]] would fill in for the dates Agnew would not be performing on.<ref name=":6" />  On 13 January 2021, it was announced that [[Mairéad Carlin]] was taking a leave from the group to pursue other projects.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Concannon|first=Claire|date=17 January 2021|title=Singer Mairéad Carlin announces she's leaving Celtic Woman|url=https://evoke.ie/2021/01/13/showbiz/singer-mairead-carlin-announces-shes-leaving-celtic-woman|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref> On 4 June 2021,  Muirgen O’Mahony was announced as a new member of the group, taking Carlin's place.

When asked how the group members got along, founding former member [[Lisa Kelly]] responded,
<blockquote>
"We get along because we're so different. [[Chloë Agnew]] is hip, [[Méav Ní Mhaolchatha]] is rational, [[Orla Fallon]] is angelic, and [[Mairead Nesbitt]] is energetic."<ref name="parade070523">{{cite web|url=http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2007/edition_06-03-2007/Personality_Parade |title=Personality Parade |work=Parade |first=Walter |last=Scott |date=23 May 2007 |access-date=18 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013004539/http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2007/edition_06-03-2007/Personality_Parade |archive-date=13 October 2007 }}</ref>
</blockquote>
According to [[Chloë Agnew]], the friendship between the vocalists was the number one question they were asked. She explained:
<blockquote>
"I think people are always looking for a 'Desperate Housewives' story, that they all hate each other and nobody actually gets along. It's all for show. And the truth of the matter is, it's not. The reality is we do all get along. The five of us are like sisters, best friends."<ref name="harmoniously">{{cite web|url=http://www.postcrescent.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080402/APC05/80402152 |title=Celtic Woman members get along harmoniously |work=Post Crescent |access-date=4 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821205951/http://www.postcrescent.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080402%2FAPC05%2F80402152 |archive-date=21 August 2014 }}</ref>
