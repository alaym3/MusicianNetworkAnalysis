'''Ordo Rosarius Equilibrio''' ('''ORE''') is a [[neofolk]] and [[martial industrial]] music group from [[Stockholm]]. The band is composed of its founding member and vocalist Tomas Pettersson, and Rose-Marie Larsen, who replaced Chelsea Krook on backup vocals. In 2008 Fredrik Leijström and Ronnie Bäck joined the band on bass and guitar.

==Biography==
In 1993, following the discontinuation of Tomas Pettersson's previous band, Archon Satani, he decided to start a new project. This project was initially called ''Ordo Equilibrio'' and joined by Chelsea Krook, his then-girlfriend.<ref>Igor Vaganov [http://drugie.here.ru/achtung/ordoeng.htm Ordo Equilibrio interview on ''Achtung Baby!''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119003849/http://drugie.here.ru/achtung/ordoeng.htm |date=2018-11-19 }}</ref> Together they made three full-length releases and one 7".

In 2001 the band had a change in line-up; Chelsea Krook was replaced by Rose-Marie Larsen.<ref>[http://www.equilibriummusic.com/interviews-0101.php3 João Monteiro - interview with Tomas Pettersson on ''Equilibrium Music'']</ref> This also spawned a change in the bandname; the word ''Rosarius'' was added. The group has so far released eight albums, one 10" and a split album with [[Spiritual Front]].

==Style==
The band's musical style has been described as "[[Neofolk#Apocalyptic folk|apocalyptic pop]]",<ref>[http://drugie.here.ru/achtung/newsordo.htm Old news page about Ordo Equilibrio on ''Achtung Baby!'']</ref> a neofolk subgenre.  The name ''Ordo Rosarius Equilibrio'' can be translated either as "Rose Order in Equilibrium" or "...for Equilibrium" or "...through Equilibrium"  (due to the ambiguity of the [[Latin language|Latin]] form 'equilibrio'). The usage of Latin alludes to the naming conventions of various [[Religious order (Catholic)|religious societies]].

In its strident, contemplative, or sombre lyrics, Ordo Rosarius Equilibrio combines seemingly incompatible polarities, such as "creation and destruction, dark and light, joy and sorrow, sex and war",.<ref>[http://www.klicktrack.com/shop/search.jsp?a=Ordo+Rosarius+Equilibrio Ordo Rosarius Equilibrio on ''Klicktrack music'']</ref>  The [[ontology]] of the pair could be accurately characterised as philosophically Luciferian or [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] (often incorporating Christian/Catholic, or [[Thelema|Thelemic]] themes but permuted idiosyncratically).  Other areas of focus include the modern experience of present-day Europeans, kink/[[BDSM]], parallels between cycles of nature and the human experience, and [[anomie]].  For example, the album ''Cocktails, Carnage, Crucifixion And Pornography'' used the initials CCCP -- [[Latin characters]] that appear identical to the abbreviation in [[Cyrillic]] for the former Soviet Union—but modified [in the band's analysis of 2003] to indicate what Russia was becoming known for at that time (according to interviews from that period).

Further sources of inspiration include [[Aleister Crowley]], [[William Blake]], the bands [[Depeche Mode]], [[Laibach (band)|Laibach]], [[SPK (band)|SPK]], [[Death In June]], [[Current 93]], [[Coil (band)|Coil]], writers [[Daniil Kharms]] and [[Ayn Rand]] and filmmakers [[Tinto Brass]] and [[Andrew Blake (director)|Andrew Blake]].<ref>[http://www.heathenharvest.com/article.php?story=20061231104322460 Malahki Thorn - Ordo Rosarius Equilibrio Interview on ''Heathen Harvest'']</ref>

In the initial years, the band incorporated [[sadomasochism]] live on stage as well.<ref>[http://www.kogaionon.com/en/kogaionon-interviews/ordo-rosarius-equilibrio-metal-maniacs-magazine-2007 Interview with Tomas Petterson on ''Kogaionon'', by ''Metal Maniacs'']</ref>

A wide range of instruments are used, including acoustic guitars, percussion and piano, together with various sound-aggregating devices combined with projected imagery. Lyrics are delivered, typically by Petterson himself, in a performance including [[spoken word]] and traditional song.
