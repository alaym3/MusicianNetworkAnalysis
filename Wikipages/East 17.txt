'''East 17''' are an English [[pop music|pop]] [[boy band]] started by [[Tony Mortimer]], [[Brian Harvey]], John Hendy, and Terry Coldwell in 1991. As of 2020, the group consists of Coldwell, Robbie Craig, and Joe Livermore. East 17 have undergone multiple lineup changes, with Coldwell remaining the only constant member.

The group has achieved eighteen top-20 singles and four top-10 albums, and they were one of the UK's most popular boy bands during the early to mid-1990s, aided by strong [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] interest in their 'bad boy' image, compared to the 'clean-cut' image of rivals [[Take That]]. Their style blended pop and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] in songs such as "[[House of Love (East 17 song)|House of Love]]" and "[[Let It Rain (East 17 song)|Let It Rain]]".

East 17 have sold over 18 million albums worldwide and according to the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI), they have been certified with sales of 1.8 million albums and 2.4 million singles in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/certified-awards.aspx |title=Certified Awards |publisher=Bpi.co.uk |access-date=4 March 2019}}</ref> Their biggest hit, "[[Stay Another Day]]", was the UK [[List of UK Singles Chart Christmas number ones|Christmas number one]] in 1994.

The group continues today under the lineup of Terry Coldwell, Joe Livermore, and former [[Artful Dodger (duo)|Artful Dodger]] collaborator [[Woman Trouble (song)|Robbie Craig]].<ref>https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/34981/robbie-craig/ {{Bare URL inline|date=June 2021}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation (1991)===
East 17 began in 1991 when [[Tony Mortimer]] was promised a record deal with [[London Records]] after he presented his own material. The deal was granted under the condition that he form a group, which would be in the format that London Records were looking for. Mortimer later formed East 17 with Brian Harvey, John Hendy, and Terry Coldwell.{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}

The group was named East 17 after the [[postcode]] of their hometown, [[Walthamstow]].<ref name="Herts">{{cite web |url=http://www.hertsandessexobserver.co.uk/East-17-star-Tony-Mortimer-Stansted-family-man/story-21904068-detail/story.html |title=Feature: East 17 star Tony Mortimer is Stansted family man |last=Holland |first=Sinead |publisher=Herts and Essex Newspapers Ltd |access-date=1 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225081547/http://www.hertsandessexobserver.co.uk/east-17-star-tony-mortimer-stansted-family-man/story-21904068-detail/story.html |archive-date=25 December 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The original roles in the band were soon altered when [[Brian Harvey]], who was intended to be a backup singer and dancer, was made lead singer due to his vocal talent.{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}

===''Walthamstow'' (1992–1993)===
Mortimer wrote the majority of the group's songs, which often contained rap verses vocalised by him to complement Harvey's more fluid vocals.{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}

The group was usually seen as a grittier, more political and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] or rap-aligned ensemble than rival boy band [[Take That]], as noted by Guy Adams of ''[[The Independent]]'':<ref name="On the road with East 17">{{cite news |first=Guy |last=Adams |title=Feature: On the road with East 17 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/on-the-road-with-east-17-438254.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716172713/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/on-the-road-with-east-17-438254.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 July 2009 |date=28 February 2007 |publisher=[[Independent News & Media]] |access-date=1 February 2010}}</ref>
{{quote|text = ''They shaved their heads, and had tattoos, and were a lot, lot cooler than the nancy boys of [[Take That]]. In the great five-year battle that dominated British pop, East 17 were also on the winning side. Their music was sharper and more streetwise. It was infused with hip hop and sold by the bucketload: 18 million records across Europe, compared with Take That's paltry 17 million.''|author= Guy Adams}}

East 17 scored twelve top-10 hits on the [[UK Singles Chart]] between 1992 and 1998.<ref name="NME report">{{cite web |title=Report: East 17 play one-off reunion show |url=https://www.nme.com/news/east-17/23200 |date=31 May 2006 |publisher=[[IPC Media]] |access-date=1 February 2010}}</ref> Their debut album, ''[[Walthamstow (album)|Walthamstow]]'', reached No. 1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. It featured a string of Top 20 singles, including "[[House of Love (East 17 song)|House of Love]]" and "Deep". "[[It's Alright (East 17 song)|It's Alright]]" became a major success in Australia, reaching No. 1 in early 1994 for seven consecutive weeks, and No. 3 in the UK in 1993.{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}} The lyrics to some of their songs, such as "Let It Rain", had political undertones, talking about war, [[peace]], [[social equality|equality]], love, and other issues.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}

===''Steam'' (1994)===
In 1994, upon the release of their second album, ''[[Steam (East 17 album)|Steam]]'', East 17 scored their only UK number-one single with "[[Stay Another Day]]". It remained at the top for five weeks and was also that year's [[Christmas]] number one.{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}

===''Up All Night'' (1995–1996)===
The group's next album, 1995's ''[[Up All Night (East 17 album)|Up All Night]]'', was less successful.

In 1996, the group hit No. 2 with the track "[[If You Ever]]", a duet with [[Gabrielle (singer)|Gabrielle]].<ref name="chartstats">{{cite web| title=East 17 Featuring Gabrielle at OfficialCharts.com | url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/ | access-date=1 February 2010}}</ref> The single was featured on their compilation album ''[[Around the World Hit Singles: The Journey So Far]]''.

===Mortimer's first departure and first split (1997)===
In January 1997, Brian Harvey was engulfed in a drug-related controversy when he claimed that he had taken [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]] pills on a night out, stating in the press that "It's cool to take drugs" and claiming that ecstasy "can make you a better person".{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}

The act went against the group's 'boy band' image, and there was a media uproar, leading to questions being raised in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].<ref>

===First reunion and second split (1998–1999)===
Coldwell and Hendy later reinstated Harvey and attempted a comeback in 1998, renaming the group '''E-17'''.<ref name="BBC report2">{{cite news |title=Report: E17 star on drugs charges |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2046793.stm |date=15 June 2002 |publisher=BBC |access-date=1 February 2010}}</ref> They landed a record deal with [[Telstar Records]] after recording an album's worth of self-written material in their home studios. Their first single as E-17 was "[[Each Time]]", which reached No. 2 in the UK. But without Mortimer's songwriting influence, the group's initial success soon wavered; sales of their next single, "[[Betcha Can't Wait]]", were disappointing, reaching number 12 in the charts, and their album ''[[Resurrection (East 17 album)|Resurrection]]'' failed to make the UK Top 40. The band was later dropped by their label in 1999 and subsequently split up.{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}

===Post-split activities (1999–2006)===
In 2001, Harvey launched himself as a solo artist in a collaboration with [[Wyclef Jean]], with the Top-20 single "[[Loving You (Ole Ole Ole)|Loving You]]", but later returned to perform numerous gigs with Coldwell and Hendy. On the [[ITV1]] [[docusoap]] ''[[Redcoats (Butlins)#Redcoats TV series|Redcoats]]'', the trio were shown performing at a gig held at [[Butlins]] in [[Bognor Regis|Bognor]] on a bill that also featured [[Keith Harris (ventriloquist)|Keith Harris]], whilst in 2005, Harvey, Coldwell, and Hendy performed a gig in Mongolia. In May 2005, Harvey was seriously injured in a car accident, requiring surgery.<ref name="BBC report">{{cite news |title=Report: Singer Harvey hopes to walk again |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4130812.stm |date=8 August 2005 |publisher=BBC |access-date=1 February 2010}}</ref>

===Second reunion and Mortimer's second departure (2006–2009)===
On 4 February 2006, Harvey appeared on the UK music television show ''[[CD:UK]]'', where he announced that East 17 might make a comeback with its four original members. In mid-February 2006, the group reformed and played their first comeback concert on 30 May at the [[Shepherd's Bush Empire]] in London.<ref name="NME report"/> After reforming for the one-off gig, it was reported that Mortimer had left the group again due to a confrontation with Harvey, leading to a  "punch-up" between the two men.<ref name="On the road with East 17"/>

A [[Channel 4]] documentary, ''East 17: The Reunion'', which charted the group's rise and fall, along with their subsequent attempt to re-launch, was broadcast in May 2007.<ref name="On the road with East 17"/>
[[File:20061231 east17 02.jpg|thumb|East 17 performing in Sibiu, Romania, on New Year's Eve 2007.]]
East 17 continued to perform as a three-member group without Mortimer.<ref name="On the road with East 17"/> They played at the [[University of Strathclyde]] on 24 September 2006, after DJ [[Colin Murray]] was unable to attend. A new single, "Fuck That", was due to be released in early 2008,<ref name="Gigwise">{{cite web |first=Scott |last=Colothan |title=Report: Brian Harvey: 'East 17 Will Take On Take That' |url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/40303/brian-harvey-east-17-will-take-on-take-that |date=25 January 2008 |publisher=[[Gigwise.com]] |access-date=1 February 2010}}</ref> along with a new album, "Universalization", but both went unreleased.

East 17 performed at the [[2009 Glastonbury Festival]] on 25 June in the dance lounge.<ref name="Glastonbury 2009">{{cite web |first=Rosie |last=Swash |title=Review: East 17 at Glastonbury 2009 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jun/26/east-17-glastonbury-2009 |date=25 June 2009 |publisher=[[Guardian News and Media Limited]] |access-date=1 February 2010}}</ref> In November 2009, the group collaborated with Mortimer in aid of the [[Born Free Foundation]]. They performed two of their best-known songs—"Deep" and "Stay Another Day"—for the ''Wild & Live!'' event at the [[Royal Albert Hall]].{{citation needed|date=August 2021}} After the performance, the four agreed that it would be best if they never sang together again. However, according to a [[BBC Radio 2]] interview with [[Zoë Ball]] in December 2009, songwriter Tony Mortimer mentioned that the band were on 'talking terms' and planning a comeback for 2010.

===Mortimer's second return, Harvey's departure, Dreelan's arrival and departure, and ''Dark Light'' (2010–2013)===
Tony Mortimer returned to East 17 in 2010. Brian Harvey left soon after, when his commitment was questioned by the rest of the group; he had been missing rehearsals and cancelling gigs. In 2011, [[T-Mobile]] used the East 17 song "House of Love" in a Royal Wedding "spoof" commercial. In April 2011, it was announced that Blair Dreelan had joined the band for their Back to the Future tour in August and September 2011 to promote their comeback single, "Secret of My Life". On 28 September 2011, Dreelan left the group due to contractual obligations. On 27 November 2011, East 17 appeared as musical guests on ''[[X Factor (Romania season 1)|X Factor Romania]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sezonul1.xfactor.a1.ro/stiri/noi_artisti_internationali_urca_pe_scena_x_factor_east_17_canta_duminica_la_antena_1|title=Noi artisti internationali urca pe scena X Factor.

East 17's fifth studio album, ''[[Dark Light (East 17 album)|Dark Light]]'', along with the new single "I Can't Get You Off My Mind", were released in 2012.

===Mortimer's third departure, Craig's arrival, ''24/7'', and Hendy's departure (2013–present)===
Tony Mortimer departed for the third time in 2013. Robbie Craig later joined East 17 in early 2014. John Hendy and Terry Coldwell became the only original band members in the group at that stage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/east-17-in-2014-brian-harvey-tony-mortimer-robbie-craig|title=East 17 are back!

In 2017, East 17 partook in [[B*Witched]]'s Australia & NZ Tour as a supporting act alongside [[Atomic Kitten]], [[S Club 7|S Club 3]], and [[Liberty X]].
During this time, the band released their sixth studio album, ''24/7'', exclusively in Australia, titling it ''24/7: Australian Tour Edition''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.auspop.com.au/2017/02/east-17-drop-new-album-247/|title=East 17 Drop New Album 24/7|website=Auspop|date=17 February 2017|access-date=15 October 2021}}</ref>

In June 2018, John Hendy departed the group, citing personal reasons, and wished them luck in a tweet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/East17online/photos/a.907166395965326/2169983913016895/?type=3|title=East 17 Fans|via=Facebook}}</ref> Since then, Terry John joined the band as Hendy's replacement,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/East17online/photos/a.907166395965326/2177169815631638/?type=3|title=East 17 Fans|website=Facebook.com}}</ref> performed with them at numerous shows, but eventually also left and was replaced by Joe Livermore.{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}
