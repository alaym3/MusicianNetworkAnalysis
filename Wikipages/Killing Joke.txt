'''Killing Joke''' are an English [[rock music|rock]] band from [[Notting Hill]], London, England, formed in 1979 by [[Jaz Coleman]] (vocals, keyboards), [[Paul Ferguson]] (drums), [[Geordie Walker]] (guitar) and [[Youth (musician)|Youth]] (bass).

Their first album, ''[[Killing Joke (1980 album)|Killing Joke]]'', was released in 1980. After the release of ''[[Revelations (Killing Joke)|Revelations]]'' in 1982, bassist Youth was replaced by [[Paul Raven (musician)|Paul Raven]]. The band achieved mainstream success in 1985 with both the album ''[[Night Time (album)|Night Time]]'' and the single  "[[Love Like Blood (song)|Love Like Blood]]".

The band's musical style emerged from the [[post-punk]] scene, but stood out due to their heavier approach, and has been cited as a key influence on [[industrial rock]].<ref name="TrouserPress">{{cite web |url=http://trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=killing_joke |title=Killing Joke |access-date=26 July 2008 |work=TrouserPress.com}}</ref> Their style evolved over many years, at times incorporating elements of [[gothic rock]],<ref>{{cite book|first=Simon|last=Reynolds|author-link=Simon Reynolds|title=[[Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978–1984]] |chapter=Chapter 22: 'Dark Things: Goth and the Return of Rock' |date=2005 |publisher=[[Faber and Faber]] |isbn=0-571-21569-6|quote=The fourth cornerstone of the Goth sound and sensibility were Killing Joke.

==History==
===Formative years (1978–1982)===
[[Paul Ferguson]] was the drummer in the band Matt Stagger when he met [[Jaz Coleman]] (from [[Cheltenham, Gloucestershire]]) in [[Notting Hill, London, England|Notting Hill, London]] in late 1978. Coleman was briefly the keyboard player in that band. He and Ferguson then left to gradually piece together Killing Joke.<ref>{{cite journal |title=That Primitive Feeling|first=Phil |last=Sutcliffe|journal=[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]|date=9 August 1980}}</ref> In the following months, they placed  advertisements in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' and other music papers.

It's like a soldier in the first world war.  He's in the trench, he knows his life is gone and that within the next ten minutes he's gonna be dead ... and then suddenly he realises that some cunt back in Westminster's got him sussed - 'What am I doing this for?

By September 1979, shortly before the release of their debut EP, ''[[Turn to Red]]'', they started the Malicious Damage [[record label]] with graphic artist Mike Coles as a way to press and sell their music.<ref>{{cite web| url        = http://www.maliciousdamage.biz/| title        = Malicious Damage| access-date        = 15 February 2008| publisher        = Malicious Damage| url-status        = dead| archive-url        = https://web.archive.org/web/20120205012140/http://www.maliciousdamage.biz/| archive-date        = 5 February 2012}}</ref> [[Island Records]] distributed the records (and released their debut single "[[Nervous System (song)|Nervous System]]"), until Malicious Damage switched to [[E.G.

In October 1979, the band recorded their first session for Peel's radio show. An ''[[NME]]'' concert review said that "their sound is a bit like early [[Siouxsie and the Banshees|[Siouxsie and the] Banshees]] without the thrilling, amoral imagination".<ref name="Lynn">{{cite work |first=Lynn |last=Hanna|title=Plague of the Punk Zombies |work=NME |page=45 |date=8 November 1980}}</ref> Concerning their live performances, it was said that "the only animation on stage is provided by Jaz who crouches behind his synthesizer, making forays like a Neanderthal man gripped by a gesturing, gibbering fury".<ref name="Lynn" /> The songs on the 1980 "[[Wardance (song)|Wardance]]/Pssyche" single were described as "heavy dance music" by the press.<ref name= Needs /> The band had changed their sound into something denser, more aggressive and more akin to [[heavy metal (music)|heavy metal]].

Killing Joke also became notorious largely due to the controversies that arose from their imagery. The images that appeared on their records and stage set were often bizarre and potentially shocking and inflammatory. Critics noted the band's black humour and the use of musical and visual shock tactics to create a reaction.<ref name= Van /> The "Wardance" sleeve had already depicted [[Fred Astaire]] dancing in a war field.<ref>Makowski, Pete.

The picture was of German abbot Alban Schachleiter walking among rows of Nazi brownshirts offering [[Hitler salute]]s and appearing to return the salute; it was later used for the cover of the band's compilation album ''[[Laugh? I Nearly Bought One!]]''.

''[[Revelations (Killing Joke)|Revelations]]'' was recorded in 1982 in Germany near Cologne with producer [[Conny Plank]], who had previously worked for [[Neu!]] and [[Kraftwerk]].<ref name= Barn>Hoskins, Barner. "True psychos of subculture".

It was the first time that one of their albums had entered the top 20 of the [[UK Albums Chart]]: ''Revelations'' peaked at No. 12 at its release.<ref name=lp/> Members of the band, especially Coleman, had become immersed in the [[occult]], particularly the works of occultist [[Aleister Crowley]]. In February of that year, Coleman, with Walker following shortly after, moved to [[Iceland]] to survive the [[Apocalypse]], which Coleman predicted was coming soon. While in Iceland, Coleman and Walker worked with musicians from the band [[Þeyr]] in the project [[Niceland (band)|Niceland]]. Youth, who had stayed in England, left the band after a few months.<ref>{{citation |first=Thomas H |last=Green |publisher=Theartsdesk.com |title=Q&A: Musician Youth |url=http://www.theartsdesk.com/new-music/theartsdesk-qa-musician-youth |date=12 March 2016 |access-date=4 May 2016}}</ref> He then began the band [[Brilliant (band)|Brilliant]] with Ferguson, but the latter defected and travelled to Iceland to rejoin Killing Joke with new bassist [[Paul Raven (musician)|Paul Raven]].

===Paul Raven joins and new direction (1982–1988)===
The new Killing Joke line-up recorded again with Plank, yielding the single "[[Birds of a Feather (Killing Joke song)|Birds of a Feather]]" and a six-track 10" [[Extended play|EP]]'' [[Ha! (Killing Joke album)|Ha!]]'', recorded live at [[Larry's Hideaway]] in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada in August. In 1983 the band released ''[[Fire Dances]]'' and its single, "[[Let's All Go (to the Fire Dances)]]", the first Killing Joke single to be promoted with a music video.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/fire-dances-mw0000196897 |title=''Fire Dances '' – Killing Joke |last=Jeffries |first=David |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=5 December 2014}}</ref> Another non-album single, "[[Me or You?]]", was released in October.

The following year brought the arrival of producer [[Chris Kimsey]], who had previously worked with [[the Rolling Stones]] and [[Led Zeppelin (band)|Led Zeppelin]]. The first releases with Kimsey were "[[Eighties (song)|Eighties]]" (April 1984) and "[[A New Day (song)|A New Day]]" (July 1984).<ref name="Hightower-Volume_30" /> The band achieved mainstream success in January 1985 with the single "[[Love Like Blood (song)|Love Like Blood]]", which blended [[Gothic rock|goth]] and [[New wave music|new wave]] to pop and rock;<ref name=mid-80s>[https://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/fun-games-killing-joke-in-the-mid-80s ''Fun & Games: Killing Joke in the mid-'80s''] by Adrien Begrand, [[PopMatters.com]]. « Punk, goth, New Wave, dance, pop, "Love Like Blood" covers all that ground with astonishing grace. »</ref> it peaked at No. 16 in the UK charts.<ref name=single>{{cite web |title=uk singles charts - Killing Joke |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/19038/killing-joke/ |work=theofficialcharts.com |access-date=28 January 2012}}</ref> In Europe, it reached the No. 5 position in the Netherlands and No. 8 in Belgium.<ref>[http://www.dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Killing+Joke&titel=Love+Like+Blood&cat=s Love like Blood - charts position in Belgium and the Netherlands].

The following album, ''[[Brighter Than a Thousand Suns (album)|Brighter than a Thousand Suns]]'' (1986) was also produced by Kimsey and saw the band's style develop further. The label rejected Kimsey's original mixes and had the album re-mixed against the wishes of the band, in an attempt to achieve more commercial success. The results have been retrospectively described as over-produced.<ref name=mid-80s /> Despite the intentions of the label, the album was a commercial failure compared to ''Night Time'', failing to reach the top 50 in the UK charts.<ref name=single /> Its two singles fared little better: "[[Adorations]]" narrowly missed the UK Top 40 and "[[Sanity (song)|Sanity]]" peaked at number 70.<ref name="officialcharts">[https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/ Chart Stats - Killing Joke].

In 1987, Coleman and Walker began working on a new project, which was presented by Coleman and Walker as a studio project to the rest of the band. Raven took part in the sessions but ultimately asked for his name to be removed from the album credits.<ref name="Mat">{{cite work |first=Mat |last=Smith |title=Killing Joke [Paul Raven interview] |work=Melody Maker |date=14 May 1988}}</ref> Ferguson recorded drums in Berlin but, according to Coleman, was dismissed because he wasn't able to manage the precise timings. Raven denied this version of events, stating, "I know Paul and when he does something he does it properly. If it wasn't right he would have stayed there 'til it was".<ref name="Mat" /> Session player [[Jimmy Copley]] was brought in to provide the drumming on the album, along with percussion player Jeff Scantlebury. Raven and Ferguson quit Killing Joke shortly afterwards, with Raven purportedly calling Coleman and Walker "a pair of ego-strokers".<ref name="Mat" /> Coleman then delivered a lecture at London's [[Courtauld Institute]] about his method behind the songs, expounding on its origins in [[gematria]] and the occult, while Walker and Scantlebury provided a minimal acoustic musical backing. A recording of this event was released as ''[[The Courtauld Talks]]''.<ref name="Schulte">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-courtald-talks-mw0000258292 |title=''The Courtald Talks'' – Killing Joke <nowiki>| Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |</nowiki> AllMusic |last=Schulte |first=Tom |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=25 February 2015}}</ref>

The resulting album, ''[[Outside the Gate]]'', released the following June, is Killing Joke's most controversial work to date due to its complex synth instrumentation and stylistic departure.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/outside-the-gate-mw0000201758|title=''Outside the Gate'' [review]|website=Allmusic|access-date=23 January 2019}}</ref> It entered the UK Albums Chart at number 92 and stayed for just one week.<ref name="UK charts">{{cite web |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/outside-the-gate/ |title=''Outside the Gate''  |website=[[Official Charts Company|Official Charts]] |access-date=1 February 2015}}</ref> No gigs were played in support of the album and it was not released in the USA. Virgin dropped the band two months later, by which time Coleman and Walker had become embroiled in a lengthy legal battle to extricate themselves from their contract with [[E.G. Records|E.G.]].

===Revised line-up (1989–1991)===
Towards the end of 1988, Coleman and Walker revived the band and began looking for full-time bass players and drummers. First on board was drummer [[Martin Atkins]], who had gained notability in Public Image Ltd. A suitable bass player proved more difficult. Former [[The Smiths|Smiths]] member [[Andy Rourke]] was hired, then dismissed after only three days. Eventually the band settled on Welsh bass player Dave "Taif" Ball, and played their first gigs in almost two years in December 1988.<ref>{{cite web| url        = http://www.taif.co.uk/taifbass/index.cfm?page=biog&more=6| title      = taif-bass: Killing Joke| access-date = 15 December 2008| format     = CFM| publisher  = taif.co.uk}}</ref> Touring continued across the UK, Europe and the US until August 1989, when the band took a break to record new material in Germany and allow Coleman time to record ''[[Songs from the Victorious City]]'' with [[Anne Dudley]] of [[Art of Noise]].

For reasons that remain unclear, the German sessions were shelved and bass player Taif left the band. He was replaced by former member Paul Raven and the revised line-up began recording again, this time in London. The result was Killing Joke's eighth album, ''[[Extremities, Dirt & Various Repressed Emotions]]'', released on the German [[Noise Records (Germany)|Noise International]] label in 1990. It marked a return to a heavier, industrial sound.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/mar/19/old-music-killing-joke-age-greed|title=Old music: Killing Joke – Age of Greed|first=Martin|last=Belam|date=19 March 2012|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>

The band toured Europe and North America until unexpectedly disbanding again in mid-1991. Coleman emigrated to New Zealand to live on a remote Pacific island, and Killing Joke entered a hiatus.

Atkins continued with Walker, Raven and the band's live keyboard player, [[John Bechdel]], as the short-lived [[Murder, Inc. (band)|Murder, Inc.]], recruiting Scottish vocalist [[Chris Connelly (musician)|Chris Connelly]] and reuniting with Ferguson as second drummer.

===Pandemonium–Democracy (1992–1996)===
[[File:Killing Joke-1994-Nottingham.jpg|thumb|Youth and Coleman (1994)]]
A Killing Joke anthology, ''Laugh? I Nearly Bought One!'', was released in 1992; during its production, Walker became reacquainted with Youth, who suggested that they reform the band with himself back on bass. That same year, two singles (on cassette and CD) appeared featuring the early songs "Change" and "Wardance" remixed by Youth, who was by then a successful producer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.soundonsound.com/people/youth-killing-joke-paul-mccartney|title=Youth: From Killing Joke to Paul McCartney|website=Soundonsound.com}}</ref>

''[[Pandemonium (Killing Joke album)|Pandemonium]]'' was released in 1994 on Youth's [[Butterfly Recordings]] label, featuring a heavy and diverse new style. [[Tom Larkin (musician)|Tom Larkin]], of New Zealand band [[Shihad]], performed drums on the album. Coleman had earlier produced Shihad's 1993 debut album, but relations later soured due to a dispute over Coleman's producer's fee. ''Pandemonium'' also featured several Egyptian musicians that Coleman had previously worked with on ''Songs from the Victorious City'', including percussionist [[Hossam Ramzy]] and violinist Aboud Abdel Al.,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/pandemonium-mw0000119138|title=Pandemonium - Killing Joke &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kerrang.com/|title=Kerrang!|website=Kerrang!}}</ref> and earned Killing Joke a memorable ''Top of the Pops'' appearance for the single "Millennium", which was a UK Top 40 hit (the album itself made the Top 20). The title track was also released as a single and made the UK Top 30. The album itself became Killing Joke's best-selling work.<ref>Coleman, Jaz (2013). ''Letters from Cythera'', p. 378. Self-published.</ref>

In 1995, the band recorded the song "Hollywood Babylon" for the [[Showgirls (soundtrack)|''Showgirls'' soundtrack]] of the [[Paul Verhoeven]] film of [[Showgirls|the same name]].

A follow-up album, ''[[Democracy (album)|Democracy]]'', was released in 1996 and also produced by Youth. ''Democracy'' introduced acoustic guitar to several songs and featured more explicitly political lyrics. The title track was released as a single and made the UK Top 40. Much of ''Pandemonium'' and all of ''Democracy'' featured session drummer Geoff Dugmore, who also played live with the band during this era. [[Nick Holywell-Walker]] joined the band on keyboards and programming for 11 years from 1994 to 2005, notably on ''Democracy'' and ''XXV Gathering''. Youth bowed out of live performance early in the ''Democracy'' tour and was replaced by [[Troy Gregory]], previously of [[Prong (band)|Prong]].<ref name="Hightower-Volume_30" />

After the ''Democracy'' tour, the band went on their longest hiatus to date. Coleman and Youth produced a string of orchestral rock albums based on the music of [[classic rock]] artists such as Led Zeppelin, [[Pink Floyd]] and [[the Doors]]. Coleman became [[Artist-in-residence|Composer in Residence]] for New Zealand and Czech [[symphony orchestra]]s,<ref name="decibelmagazine.com-Killing_Joke">{{cite web|url=http://decibelmagazine.com/features/jul2007/killingjoke.aspx |title=Killing Joke |access-date=7 January 2007 |last=Bennett |first=J. |format=ASPX |publisher=Decibel Magazine|quote=Coleman is a Composer in Residence to the Prague Symphony Orchestra, the nation of New Zealand and, as of October 2006, the entire European Union.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016193752/http://decibelmagazine.com/features/jul2007/killingjoke.aspx |archive-date=16 October 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and made his acting debut with the main role in the film ''Rok ďábla'' (''Year of the Devil'') by Czech filmmaker [[Petr Zelenka]].

===Reformation and the death of Paul Raven (2002–2007)===
In 2002, Coleman, Walker and Youth recorded their [[Killing Joke 2003 (album)|second self-titled album]] with special guest [[Dave Grohl]] on drums. Produced by [[Andy Gill]] and released to much acclaim in 2003, it was heralded as a powerful addition to their earlier classics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/killing-joke-2003-mw0002021927|title=Killing Joke [2003] - Killing Joke &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.anirrationaldomain.net/articles/current/playlouder26july2003.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209013619/http://www.anirrationaldomain.net/articles/current/playlouder26july2003.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 February 2007|title=Play Louder 26 July 2003|date=9 February 2007}}</ref> In 2003, the band played at the biggest open air festival in Europe - [[Przystanek Woodstock]]<ref name="wosp">{{cite web|url=http://www.en.wosp.org.pl/woodstock/ |title=Home - Wielka Orkiestra Świątecznej PomocyP |publisher=en.wosp.org.pl |access-date=11 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325213029/http://www.en.wosp.org.pl/woodstock/ |archive-date=25 March 2010 }}</ref> in Poland. The [[War on Terror]] and the [[invasion of Iraq]] were cited as major factors in their reforming, reflected in the lyrical content of much of the album, based on themes of war, government control and [[Armageddon]]. The album, which fell just short of the UK Top 40 and spawned two singles, "Loose Cannon" (a UK Top 25 hit) and "Seeing Red". The songs were all credited to Coleman/Walker/Youth/Gill, although Raven's name is also on the list of musicians on the liner notes, marking his return to the band after more than a decade. The album was accompanied by a tour of the United States, Europe and Australia in 2003-2004, with ex-Prong drummer [[Ted Parsons]] on board.

In February 2005, now with young drummer Ben Calvert (Twin Zero, Sack Trick), Killing Joke played two consecutive shows at London's [[Shepherd's Bush Empire]] to commemorate their 25th anniversary. [[DVD]] and CD recordings from these concerts were released in the fall of the same year as ''XXV Gathering: The Band that Preys Together Stays Together''. In June, remastered and expanded editions of ''Pandemonium'' and ''Democracy'', were released by [[Cooking Vinyl]]. These were followed in July by remasters of their first four albums (''Killing Joke'' to ''Ha!'') on [[EMI]], who by then owned the E.G. Records catalogue. The second batch of EMI remasters would not appear until January 2008. That year, Reza Udhin joined the band on keyboards when they supported [[Mötley Crüe]]'s British tour; they then began work on their next album in [[Prague]]. Killing Joke's contribution to the world of rock was recognised when they were awarded the "Lifetime Achievement Award" at the 2005 ''[[Kerrang]]'' Awards.<ref>Smith, Alexander.

[[File:Killing joke paris 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Killing Joke plays live in Paris during the 2008 tour (Le Trabendo, 27 September 2008).]]
After the death of Raven, the original line-up of Coleman, Youth, Walker and Ferguson reunited. Coleman told ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' magazine how the return of Ferguson came up after 20 years of absence:

<blockquote>Everything came together when we all met at...Raven's funeral. It was funny the unifying effect it had on all of us. It made us realise our mortality and how important Killing Joke is to all of us.<ref>''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'', May 2008, Issue 170</ref></blockquote>

They assembled in Granada, Spain, to prepare a world tour consisting of two nights in various capital cities of the world, playing a programme of four complete albums. Recordings of the rehearsals were later released as ''Duende - The Spanish Sessions''. The first night was dedicated to their first two albums, ''Killing Joke'' and ''What's THIS For...!'', while the second night featured large parts of ''Pandemonium'' plus some early Island singles. The world tour began in September in Tokyo and concluded in Chicago in October.<ref>{{cite web| url        = http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=29846_0_2_5_C| title      = Killing Joke reform and tour| access-date = 14 March 2008| date       = 6 March 2008| format     = PHP| work       = LATEST NEWS| publisher  = SIDE-LINE.com}}</ref>

==Style and influences==
The band called their sound "tension music".<ref name=nine /> Co-founder Ferguson described it as "the sound of the earth vomiting. I'm never quite sure whether to be offended by the question of 'are we punk' or not, because, I loved punk music, but we weren't. And I think our influences were beyond punk. Obviously before punk, there was Led Zeppelin, [[Black Sabbath]] and there was [[Yes (band)|Yes]] even and [[King Crimson]], and those had all influenced me as a player, and the other guys would say other things, but I'm sure they were all part of their history as well".<ref name="FP">Smith, Alex (4 September 2004).
