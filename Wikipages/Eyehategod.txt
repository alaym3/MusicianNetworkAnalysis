'''Eyehategod''' (also abbreviated and referred to as '''EHG''') is an American [[sludge metal]] band from [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] who formed in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p38682|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Eyehategod|last=Huey|first=Steve|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=May 1, 2010}}</ref> They have become one of the better known bands to emerge from the [[Music of New Orleans#Heavy metal|NOLA metal scene]]. Throughout the years, their core lineup has remained, with the exceptions of the bassist, a slot in which several musicians have played, and the death of drummer Joey LaCaze in 2013. As of 2021, the band has released seven studio albums.

Eyehategod have noted the [[Melvins]], [[Carnivore (band)|Carnivore]], [[The Obsessed]], [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]], [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Corrosion of Conformity]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[Celtic Frost]], [[Confessor (band)|Confessor]], and [[Saint Vitus (band)|Saint Vitus]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.myspace.com/sexthroughwar/blog/140890779 |title=Archived copy |access-date=February 7, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312120017/https://www.myspace.com/sexthroughwar/blog/140890779 |archive-date=March 12, 2013 }}</ref> as key influences to their sound. Heavy, detuned, and [[blues]]y guitar [[riff]]s dominate the band's discography. They are combined with walls of [[Audio feedback|feedback]], and tortured vocals, with lyrical themes centered around [[substance abuse]], to create a harsh [[misanthropic]] vibe.

The band were friends with [[grindcore]] group [[Anal Cunt]] and performed with them for the first show after their frontman [[Seth Putnam]] was revived from his 2004 coma. Putnam had previously filled in for Mike Williams at a show in New Orleans during Mardi Gras in 1996. Williams was out of town at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bardomethodology.com/articles/2018/08/29/phil-anselmo-interview/|title=Phil Anselmo interview|website=Bardomethodology.com|date=August 29, 2018}}</ref>

==History==
=== Formation, demos and first two albums (1988–1995) ===
[[Jimmy Bower]] and Joey LaCaze founded the band on April 20, 1988 (in accordance with [[420 (cannabis culture)|4/20 in cannabis culture]]), and they recruited Brian Patton, Steve Dale and vocalist Chris Hilliard.<ref name="spirit">{{cite web|last1=n/a|title=Eyehategod: Interview [Interview with Gary Mader]|url=http://www.spirit-of-metal.com/interview-groupe-Eyehategod-id_inter-607-l-fr.html&usg=ALkJrhiYUIJ9_KfWeq-7r6_CzC__T5o6jA|website=spirit-of-metal.com|publisher=Spirit of Metal|access-date=September 15, 2009}}</ref> Hilliard would later leave the group early on, and would be replaced by [[Mike Williams (singer)|Mike Williams]]. The band then recorded two demos ''Garden Dwarf Woman Driver'' (1989) and ''Lack of Almost Everything'' (1990); the latter was sent out to various labels. They eventually got signed to the small French label Intellectual Convulsion, and released their first album ''[[In the Name of Suffering]]'' in 1990. The album had a far more primitive and raw sound than later releases (as it was recorded by the inexperienced band members for only $1,000),<ref name="metalurges">{{cite web|last1=n/a|title=013 Eyehategod Biography|url=https://metalurgespodcast.wordpress.com/2014/02/13/013-eyehategod/|website=Metalurgespodcast.wordpress.com|date=February 13, 2014|publisher=Metal Urges Podcast|access-date=February 14, 2014}}</ref> and had a more [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] feel to it. The label dissolved with only a couple of thousand copies having been printed, so the band had to find a new label. They soon signed with [[Century Media]] however, who re-released ''In the Name of Suffering'' on December 1, 1992, as it is known today.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> Also in 2006, ''In the Name of Suffering'' was re-issued with four bonus tracks. These four tracks were the same as those on the original demo ''Lack of Almost Everything''.

Eyehategod then went on to record ''[[Take as Needed for Pain]]'' in 1993,<ref name="LarkinHR">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Heavy Rock]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1999|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0257-7|page=155/6}}</ref> with new bassist Mark Schultz who had also contributed on ''In The Name Of Suffering''. The album was recorded at Studio 13, a small recording studio working from the 13th floor of an abandoned [[department store]] on Canal Street in New Orleans.<ref name="metalurges"/> The band played daily during this period to put down tracks for the album. At the time, Mike Williams was homeless (having been thrown out by his former girlfriend) and living in an abandoned, flea-infested room above a strip club just a few minutes away from the studio. The sound of ''Take as Needed for Pain'' seemed much closer to what the members intended than the material on ''In the Name of Suffering'', and it shows a cleaner, more distinct sound with better defined riffs. The [[southern rock]], [[blues music|blues]], and [[doom metal|doom]] influences are also more distinctly felt on this album. After the release of the album, the band toured extensively with acts such as [[Chaos UK]], [[Buzzov*en]], [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]] and [[Corrosion of Conformity]]. After touring, the band members briefly spread out in different directions. Mike Williams busied himself contributing to ''[[Metal Maniacs]]'' magazine. Jimmy Bower played drums on [[Crowbar (U.S. band)|Crowbar]]'s ''[[Broken Glass (album)|Broken Glass]]'' as well as [[Down (band)|Down]]'s debut album, ''[[NOLA (album)|NOLA]]''. Brian Patton recorded [[Soilent Green]]'s debut album, ''[[Pussysoul]]''.

=== ''Dopesick'' and ''Confederacy of Ruined Lives'' (1995–2000) ===
The band had been recording several demos, which were released on various seven-inch records and [[split record|splits]] on various labels, but finally in 1995 settled down to record an album, with [[Pepper Keenan]] of Corrosion of Conformity as producer, and new bassist Vince LeBlanc, which would be named ''[[Dopesick (album)|Dopesick]]''.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> At the time, Mike Williams was living in [[Clinton Hill, Brooklyn]] in New York City, and so had to travel between there and New Orleans frequently for the recording sessions. The recording sessions were infamously chaotic, and involved the studio owner reportedly calling Century to ask if the band were insane, and threatening to kick them out. This particular incident occurred after Mike Williams had attempted to record the sound of smashing glass for the introduction to the album, by smashing a bottle on the floor of the studio. In the process he slashed his hand open badly and bled all over the studio floor (this recording did make it to the record as the introduction to the first track, "My Name is God (I Hate You)"). One of the band members then apparently smeared the words "[[Hell]]" and "Death to Pigs" in Mike's blood. Brian Patton and Joey LaCaze then flew out to San Francisco to [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mix]] the album. This album was far more chaotic than their previous, but still retained the distinct southern, bluesy feel, distancing it from ''In the Name of Suffering''. The band then embarked on a US tour in the spring of 1996 to support the album, supporting [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]] and [[Pantera]], bringing their music to a far wider audience, raising the profile of [[sludge metal]], and becoming (in)famous as one of its founding acts.

Eyehategod then went through a period of internal disputes, and went on unofficial hiatus as its members scattered again to record and tour with their various side-projects; namely Soilent Green, Corrosion of Conformity and Crowbar. Eventually, in 2000, the band reconvened (again with a new bassist, this time Daniel Nick) to compile their various ''Take as Needed for Pain'' and ''Dopesick'' era singles, seven inches and split records into one record, ''[[Southern Discomfort (Eyehategod album)|Southern Discomfort]]''. This reconvention gave them the impetus to knuckle down and record another album, and that album was 2000's ''[[Confederacy of Ruined Lives]]''. The album was a much more polished, sober affair, and so sounded distinctly more like a sequel to ''Take as Needed for Pain'' than ''Dopesick''. After its release, the band then toured extensively, embarking on a world tour for the first time, with dates in Europe and Japan.

=== Subsequent activities (2001–2013) ===
By 2001, the members of Eyehategod had continued juggling with various side-projects. During this time, Down recorded their second album, and Bower formed the mostly instrumental band, [[Clearlight (band)|The Mystick Krewe of Clearlight]], as well as Soilent Green releasing their third album. Mike Williams also founded [[Outlaw Order]] and [[Arson Anthem]]. During all this activity, Eyehategod found time to compile and release their live album ''[[10 Years of Abuse (and Still Broke)]]'' (which was mainly released due to a contractual obligation with Century Media), and record and release yet more split records and 7&nbsp;inches. With the release of their live album, the band were free of their contract with Century, and chose to sign to Emetic Records (with their fifth and current bassist, Gary Mader) for the release of their 2005 stop-gap compilation album, ''[[Preaching the "End-Time" Message]]'', much in the vein of ''Southern Discomfort'', but this time with some unreleased studio tracks.

Following the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]], singer [[Mike Williams (Singer)|Mike Williams]] and his ex-girlfriend Alicia Morgan (a member of [[sludge metal]] band, 13) were arrested in [[Morgan City, Louisiana]] on a [[narcotics]] charge. Williams spent 91 days in the [[Morgan City, Louisiana|Morgan City]] Jail, and kicked his heroin habit.<ref>{{cite news|first=Andy |last=Capper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/mar/19/13 |title=Appetite for destruction &#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=March 19, 2006 |access-date=August 24, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Capper |first=Andy |url=http://www.viceland.com/int/v12n10/htdocs/god.php |title=Godhateseye &#124; VICE United States |website=Viceland.com |date=December 1, 2005 |access-date=August 24, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120004456/http://www.viceland.com/int/v12n10/htdocs/god.php |archive-date=November 20, 2008 }}</ref>

With the help of his Eyehategod bandmates and supporters such as [[Phil Anselmo]], Williams was released from jail on December 2, 2005. The band played a set at the 2006 [[Mardi Gras]] festival, the first since the disaster. Emetic Records released a various artists [[tribute album]] to Eyehategod on March 20, 2007, titled ''[[For the Sick]]''. On August 29, 2008, the band celebrated their 20-year anniversary with a show at One Eyed Jacks in New Orleans. The band played a few shows in the American South in May 2009, and are on tour the same winter. They also performed at [[Hellfest Summer Open Air|Hellfest]] in France in June.

Jimmy Bower announced in an interview that Eyehategod are still active and preparing a new album. The band played at the Inferno festival in Oslo, Norway, on April 1, 2010, and also played two sets at the Roadburn festival later that month.  Eyehategod performed a new song called "New Orleans Is the New Vietnam" during their set at their July 1, 2011 show in [[Roskilde Festival]], Denmark.

Drummer Joey LaCaze died on August 23, 2013 from respiratory failure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://louderthanhell.net/bands/united-states/eyehategod/news/2013/08/24/144121/drummer-joey-lacaze-dies/|title=Parked Domain|date=September 22, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922064245/http://louderthanhell.net/bands/united-states/eyehategod/news/2013/08/24/144121/drummer-joey-lacaze-dies/|access-date=July 17, 2021|archive-date=September 22, 2018}}</ref>  [http://www.earsplitcompound.com/site/ Earsplit PR] issued a press release on the life and death of LaCaze.

[[file:Hellfest2018EyeHateGod 03.jpg|thumb|left|Mike Williams (left) and Jimmy Bower performing at Hellfest 2018]]
In May 2014, the band released a [[Eyehategod (album)|self-titled]] full-length album on [[Phil Anselmo]]'s label [[Housecore Records]]. This album is the last featuring Joey LaCaze on drums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19381-eyehategod-eyehategod/|title=Eyehategod: Eyehategod Album Review|website=Pitchfork.com}}</ref>

On August 4, 2016, Williams announced Anselmo would be filling in for him at a show in New Orleans and the 7th annual GwarBBQ. Williams cited "serious health issues" that prevented him from being physically able to perform.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/OfficialEyeHateGod/posts/10155051178870961|title=EYEHATEGOD - via Mike IX and the Southern Nihilism Front:... {{!}} Facebook|website=Facebook.com|language=en|access-date=March 1, 2017}}</ref>

On September 22, 2016, Earsplit PR announced that [[Randy Blythe]] of [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]] would be filling in for Williams for the entire duration of the following month's tour with Discharge and Toxic Holocaust.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.earsplitcompound.com/site/2016/09/22/eyehategod-randy-blythe-to-fill-in-for-mike-ix-williams-on-upcoming-us-tour-with-discharge-and-toxic-holocaust/|title=EYEHATEGOD: Randy Blythe To Fill In For Mike IX Williams On Upcoming US Tour With Discharge And Toxic Holocaust {{!}} Earsplit Compound|website=Earsplitcompound.com|language=en-US|access-date=March 1, 2017}}</ref>

By July 2018, Eyehategod had begun working on their sixth studio album, which was initially planned to be released in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|title=EYEHATEGOD Frontman Says Guitarist BRIAN PATTON Quit Band To Focus On Family Life|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/eyehategod-frontman-says-guitarist-brian-patton-quit-band-to-focus-on-family-life/|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=July 9, 2018|access-date=July 10, 2018}}</ref> The band announced on their Facebook page on October 14, 2020 that the album was finished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metalstorm.net/events/news_comments.php?news_id=39922|title=Eyehategod - Finishing New Album|website=Metalstorm.net|access-date=October 14, 2020|date=October 14, 2020}}</ref> Two months later, ''[[A History of Nomadic Behavior]]'' was revealed as the title of the new album, which was released on March 12, 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/eyehategod-releases-high-risk-trigger-single-from-a-history-of-nomadic-behavior-album/|title=EYEHATEGOD Releases 'High Risk Trigger' Single From 'A History Of Nomadic Behavior' Album|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=December 4, 2020|date=December 4, 2020}}</ref>

==Outlaw Order==
While Jimmy Bower was busy playing drums for [[Down (band)|Down]], the other four members of Eyehategod formed a side-project called '''Outlaw Order''' (abbreviated to '''OO%'''). The band released a limited edition [[7"]] [[Extended play|EP]] in 2003 called ''[[Legalize Crime]]'', which has since been re-released on CD with a bonus live track and is available through Eyehategod's webstore. The criminal theme is apparently because at the time of the band's formation all five of the members were on [[probation]], and have consistently been in trouble with the law.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}} Mark Shultz is currently serving a prison sentence and so has been replaced by Justin Grisoli.

The band released their debut album, ''[[Dragging Down the Enforcer]]'', on November 10, 2008.
