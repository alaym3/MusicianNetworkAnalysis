'''Blonde Redhead''' is an American [[alternative rock]]  band composed of Kazu Makino (vocals, keys/[[rhythm guitar]]) and twin brothers Simone and Amedeo Pace (drums/keys and [[lead guitar]]/bass/keys/vocals, respectively) that formed in New York City in 1993. The band's earliest albums were noted for their [[noise rock]] influences, though their sound evolved by the early 2000s with the releases of ''[[Misery is a Butterfly]]'' (2004) and ''[[23 (Blonde Redhead album)|23]]'' (2007), which both incorporated elements of [[dream pop]], [[shoegaze]] and other genres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/807-misery-is-a-butterfly/|work=Pitchfork|date=April 12, 2004|author=Carr, Eric|title=Misery is a Butterfly|access-date=November 5, 2011}}</ref> They have released nine regular studio albums and have toured internationally.

==Career==
Amedeo and Simone Pace were born in [[Milan]], [[Italy]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/13/dining/blonde-redhead-simone-pace-finds-his-backbeat-in-two-tiny-espresso-sips.html|title=Blonde Redhead's Simone Pace Finds His Backbeat in Two Tiny Sips|last=Mishan|first=Ligaya|date=May 11, 2015|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=September 12, 2016}}</ref> grew up in [[Montreal]] ([[Saint-Leonard, Quebec|Saint-Léonard]]), but later moved to [[Boston]] to study [[jazz]]. After earning [[Bachelor's degree]]s, they entered the [[New York City]] underground music scene. Blonde Redhead formed in New York in 1993 after Amedeo and Simone met Kazu Makino, an art student at the time, by chance at a local Italian restaurant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/blonde-redhead-mn0000046527|work=Allmusic|title=Blonde Redhead|access-date=November 2, 2013}}</ref> The band named themselves after a song on the 1981 EP ''[[A Taste of DNA]]'' by the [[no wave]] group [[DNA (American band)|DNA]].

Blonde Redhead's [[Blonde Redhead (album)|self-titled debut album]] was released in 1995.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1344252/blonde-redhead-albums-from-worst-to-best/franchises/counting-down/attachment/blonderedhead/|title=Blonde Redhead (1995)|last=Lobenfeld|first=Claire|date=May 8, 2013|website=Stereogum.com|access-date=August 25, 2016}}</ref> Shortly afterwards, fourth member Maki Takahashi left the band and was replaced by her friend [[Toko Yasuda]] as bassist. Yasuda played on the band's second album ''La Mia Vita Violenta'' also released in 1995.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1344252/blonde-redhead-albums-from-worst-to-best/franchises/counting-down/attachment/lamiavitaviolenta/|title=La Mia Vita Violenta (1995)|last=Lobenfeld|first=Claire|date=July 12, 2013|website=Stereogum.com|access-date=August 27, 2016}}</ref> Both records appeared on the New York label Smells Like. The band continued as a trio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1344252/blonde-redhead-albums-from-worst-to-best/franchises/counting-down/|title=Blonde Redhead Albums From Worst To Best|last=Lobenfeld|first=Claire|date=July 12, 2013|website=Stereogum.com|access-date=August 25, 2016}}</ref>

Their third album, ''[[Fake Can Be Just as Good]]'', was released through Touch & Go in 1997.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1344252/blonde-redhead-albums-from-worst-to-best/franchises/counting-down/attachment/front-3/|title=Fake Can Be Just As Good (1997)|last=Lobenfeld|first=Claire {{!}}|date=July 12, 2013|website=Stereogum.com|access-date=August 27, 2016}}</ref> The band enlisted the help of [[Vern Rumsey]] of [[Unwound]], who filled the role of guest bassist. Subsequent albums featured [[Skúli Sverrisson]], who the twins knew from their time in Boston.

On their fourth album, ''[[In an Expression of the Inexpressible]]'', [[Guy Picciotto]] of [[Fugazi]] was hired as producer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1344252/blonde-redhead-albums-from-worst-to-best/franchises/counting-down/attachment/inanexpression/|title=In An Expression Of The Inexpressible (1998)|last=Lobenfeld|first=Claire|date=May 8, 2013|website=Stereogum.com|access-date=August 25, 2016}}</ref> Picciotto also contributed in the construction to the song "Futurism vs. Passéism Part 2" as well as lending it his vocals to the 1998 release. In 2000 Picciotto also co-produced ''[[Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons]]'' with [[Ryan Hadlock]], an album about the relationship between Makino and Amedeo Pace.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1344252/blonde-redhead-albums-from-worst-to-best/franchises/counting-down/attachment/melody-of-certain-damaged-lemons/|title=Melody Of Certain Damaged Lemons (2000)|last=Lobenfeld|first=Claire|date=July 12, 2013|website=Stereogum.com|access-date=August 27, 2016}}</ref>

The four-year delay between ''[[Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons]]'' and ''[[Misery Is a Butterfly]]'' is attributed to Makino's recovery time after being trampled by a horse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freewilliamsburg.com/april_2004/blonde-redhead.html |title=Blonde Redhead |publisher=Freewilliamsburg.com |date=March 23, 2004 |access-date=February 20, 2012}}</ref> Much of the visual and lyrical imagery of ''Misery Is a Butterfly'' is reflective of the accident, especially in the [[music video]] for "Equus." It was the last time Picciotto produced the band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1344252/blonde-redhead-albums-from-worst-to-best/franchises/counting-down/attachment/miseryisabutterfly/|title=Misery Is A Butterfly (2004)|last=Claire|first=Lobenfeld|date=July 12, 2013|website=Stereogum.com|access-date=August 27, 2016}}</ref>

In 2006 Makino recorded vocals for the film ''[[Sisters (2006 film)|Sisters]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dzubak.com/news.htm|title=Contact Ed Dzubak|last=Epstein|first=Sharon|website=Dzubak.com|access-date=August 25, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110326103505/http://www.dzubak.com/news.htm|archive-date=March 26, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[Alan Moulder]] mixed the trio's album ''[[23 (Blonde Redhead album)|23]]'' which was released on 4AD, in April 2007.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1344252/blonde-redhead-albums-from-worst-to-best/franchises/counting-down/attachment/23/|title=23 (2007)|last=Lobenfeld|first=Claire|date=May 8, 2013|website=Stereogum.com|access-date=August 25, 2016}}</ref>

In mid-2008, they wrote and recorded the score of the documentary feature film ''[[The Dungeon Masters]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Blonde-Redhead-The-Dungeon-Masters-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/release/3187672|title=Blonde Redhead - The Dungeon Masters (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)|website=Discogs.com|access-date=August 25, 2016}}</ref> The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and was released on February 12, 2010; a soundtrack album was released in July 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theplaylist.blogspot.com/2010/01/blonde-redhead-composing-score-to.html |title=The Playlist: Blonde Redhead Composing The Score To The Documentary, 'Dungeon Masters' |publisher=Theplaylist.blogspot.com |date=July 14, 2006 |access-date=February 20, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifc.com/fix/2010/07/the-dungeon-masters-blonde-red|title="The Dungeon Masters" Blonde Redhead Soundtrack and DVD Release|access-date=August 25, 2016}}</ref> In 2009, Blonde Redhead contributed to the AIDS benefit album ''[[Dark Was the Night (album)|Dark Was the Night]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].

In March 2010 the band included a demo version of the song "Not Getting There" on a 4AD sampler entitled ''Fragments From Work In Progress''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1344252/blonde-redhead-albums-from-worst-to-best/franchises/counting-down/attachment/pennysparkle/|title=Stereogum|website=Stereogum.com|access-date=August 25, 2016}}</ref> Their eighth album, ''[[Penny Sparkle]]'', was released in September 2010 through 4AD.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.supersweet.org/main.aspx?atype=1&aname=Music_Blonde_Redhead&con=1&sc1=0&sc2=0|title=Blonde Redhead interview|last=Dempster|first=Gemma|website=Supersweet.org|access-date=August 25, 2016}}</ref> The album was again mixed by Alan Moulder,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14609-penny-sparkle/|title=Blonde Redhead: Penny Sparkle Album Review|last=Cohen|first=Ian|date=September 14, 2010|website=Pitchfork.com|access-date=August 25, 2016}}</ref> and reached 79 in the Billboard 200 chart.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/290725/blonde-redhead/chart|title=Blonde Redhead - Chart history {{!}} Billboard|website=Billboard.com|access-date=August 25, 2016|archive-date=August 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810142139/https://www.billboard.com/artist/290725/blonde-redhead/chart|url-status=dead}}</ref> For the subsequent tour the band added a key-board player.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/579841/blonde-redhead-olof-arnalds-music-box-hollywood-111610/photo/attachment/blonde_redhead-music_box9380/|title=Blonde Redhead, Ólöf Arnalds @ Music Box, Hollywood 11/16/10|last=Youssef|first=Andrew|date=November 18, 2010|website=Stereogum.com|access-date=August 25, 2016}}</ref> The band released a six-track remix EP in July 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/756692/download-blonde-redhead-remix-ep-feat-gayngs-games-salem-pantha-du-prince/mp3s/|title=Download Blonde Redhead Remix EP Feat.

A year later, the band started the project for their next album but without the support of 4AD. Self-financed, the band embarked on a haphazard recording schedule with producer Drew Brown.<ref name=":0" /> Simone Pace noted about Brown's involvement that "he has so much experience and definitely dictated the direction of the record; the choices of instruments, concept and that it was minimal." He forced the band to use analogue instruments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://timeout.co.il/en/nightlife/blonde-redhead|title=Blonde Redhead: An Interview with Simone Pace|date=March 2, 2015|language=en-US|access-date=September 12, 2016}}</ref>

In April 2014 their song "[[For the Damaged Coda]]" was used in an episode of the first season of the cartoon [[Rick and Morty]]. The use of this song was again repeated in April 2017 in the third season. The use of the song became an important plot device regarding the character "Evil Morty" for the series. Around 2018 this song became an [[Internet meme]] expressing the sadness one feels at the worst moments of one's life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/9kgyyz/rick-and-mortys-for-the-damaged-coda-scene-spawns-a-savage-new-meme|title = 'Rick and Morty's' Most Dramatic Moment Has Spawned a Savage New Meme}}</ref>

The band released their ninth album, ''[[Barragán (Blonde Redhead album)|Barragán]]'', on September 2, 2014 through Kobalt.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/features/interviews/interview-simone-pace-of-blonde-redhead|title=Simone Pace of Blonde Redhead: "We've always done what we wanted"|last=Hannah|first=Andrew|date=September 9, 2014|website=Thelineofbestfit.com|access-date=August 25, 2016}}</ref> It was preceded by the single "No More Honey" that appeared in June.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1685998/blonde-redhead-no-more-honey-barragan-details/mp3s/|title=Blonde Redhead – "No More Honey" + Barragán Details|last=Bowe|first=Miles|date=June 10, 2014|website=Stereogum.com|access-date=August 27, 2016}}</ref> It was followed by the second single, "Dripping,"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1691065/blonde-redhead-dripping/mp3s/|title=Blonde Redhead – "Dripping"|date=July 8, 2014|access-date=August 27, 2016}}</ref> which included a video.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1722804/blonde-redhead-dripping-video/video/|title=Blonde Redhead – "Dripping" Video|last=Breihan|first=Tom|date=December 3, 2014|website=Stereogum.com|access-date=August 27, 2016}}</ref> The band also provided the soundtrack to the Danish film ''The Commentator''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2014/06/17/music/blonde-redhead-gets-comfortable-past-records/#.V9aUrE0wgdU|title=Blonde Redhead gets comfortable with past records {{!}} The Japan Times|language=en-US|access-date=September 12, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coolhunting.com/culture/the-commentator|title=The Commentator|date=March 21, 2012|access-date=September 12, 2016}}</ref>
