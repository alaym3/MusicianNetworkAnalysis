'''Shakey Graves''' (born '''Alejandro Rose-Garcia'''; June 4, 1987) is an American [[Americana (music)|Americana]] musician from Austin, Texas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/10/18/356890096/a-suitcase-musician-comes-home-shakey-graves-on-and-the-war-came |title=A Suitcase Musician Comes Home: Shakey Graves On 'And The War Came' |publisher=Npr.org |date=2014-10-18 |accessdate=2015-04-04}}</ref>

His music combines blues, folk, country, and rock and roll. Rose-Garcia received his stage name at [[Old Settler's Music Festival]] in 2007 after a stranger, apparently high on LSD, rambled "spooky wagons". Then he and his friends jokingly gave each other Native American guide names over a campfire. After an inspired night of playing music, he decided to keep the name.<ref name="BE LIE ALL">{{cite web|title=Shakey Graves -- Late July|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUkSTnUK_T0|website=Youtube.com|accessdate=2015-04-04}}</ref>

== History ==
Before being known as Shakey Graves, Rose-Garcia had acting roles in ''[[Friday Night Lights (TV series)|Friday Night Lights]]'' and the ''[[Spy Kids (film)|Spy Kids]]'' franchise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1413209/|title=Alejandro Rose-Garcia|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=2020-03-04}}</ref>

Shakey Graves became known for his [[one-man band]] set up and most of his 2011 self-released debut album ''Roll the Bones'' features him playing solo.<ref name="diffuser.fm">{{Cite web|url=http://diffuser.fm/shakey-graves-the-perfect-parts-seth-meyers/|title=Shakey Graves Performs 'The Perfect Parts' on 'Late Night'|website=Diffuser.fm|access-date=2017-12-11}}</ref> This set up originated after he grew tired of having to borrow kick drums and high hats in order to perform. His solution consisted of a modified suitcase that functions as both a kick drum and a tambourine stand built by a close friend.

His unique style of performance led to him being asked to be the official “busker” for the [[Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros|Edward Sharpe]] and [[Mumford & Sons]] [[Railroad Revival Tour]] in 2011, where he played music for patrons entering each venue.

His follow-up EP ''The Donor Blues'' was released in 2012, and features a collection of recordings from 2009.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2012/12/new-music-shakey-graves-doe-jane/|title=New Music: Shakey Graves – "Doe, Jane"|date=2012-12-14|work=Consequence of Sound|access-date=2017-12-11|language=en-US}}</ref>

After being courted by multiple labels, Shakey Graves signed with [[Dualtone Records]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2014-09-26/full-circle/|title=Full Circle|access-date=2017-12-11|language=en-US}}</ref> When he began working on the album, he added other musicians to his recording process and live set, including multi-instrumentalists Patrick O'Connor, Jon Shaw, and Chris Boosahda, who produced the album. Three songs are duets with ex-[[Paper Bird]] member [[Esmé Patterson]]. The album, titled ''And the War Came'', was released on October 7, 2014.

Shakey Graves then began touring as a three-piece band. The band made their television debut on October 14, 2014 on ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://teamcoco.com/video/shakey-graves-10-14-14|title=Shakey Graves "Dearly Departed" 10/14/14|publisher= tbs.com| date = 2014-10-15| accessdate= 2015-04-14}}</ref> and then appeared on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', performing "Dearly Departed" with Patterson.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.cbs.com/shows/late_show/video/8C67063C-1130-7516-8865-8472824C6EA2/shakey-graves-dearly-departed-david-letterman/ |title = Shakey Graves: "Dearly Departed" - David Letterman|publisher = cbs.com |date = 2015-02-14| accessdate = 2015-04-13}}</ref> The band performed their next single, "The Perfect Parts", on ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers]]''.<ref name="diffuser.fm"/> On May 6, 2015 the band performed on [[Austin City Limits]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/music/2015-10-11/acl-review-shakey-graves/|title=ACL Review: Shakey Graves|access-date=2017-12-11|language=en-US}}</ref>
