Sean returned in late 2007 with the new single "[[Ride It (Jay Sean song)|Ride It]]", which was the first single from his second album ''[[My Own Way (album)|My Own Way]]''. It was to be the first album released as a joint-venture between his own label Jayded and [[2Point9 Records]]. The video for "Ride It", released in early 2008, featured Sean with a new style after being out of the limelight for nearly three and a half years. ''My Own Way'' debuted at No. 6 in the official [[UK Albums Chart]] and generated two more UK top 20 singles, "Ride It" and "Maybe". On the back of this Sean received two [[MOBO Awards|MOBO Award]] nominations, for Best UK Male (alongside [[Dizzee Rascal]], [[Taio Cruz]], [[Wiley (rapper)|Wiley]] and [[Sway DaSafo|Sway]]) and Best R'n'B/Soul (alongside [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]], [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]], [[Ne-Yo]] and [[Chris Brown (American singer)|Chris Brown]]).

''Touch'' Magazine in the UK described him as "the UK's answer to Ne-Yo," while The Independent called him "...an urban legend in the making."
