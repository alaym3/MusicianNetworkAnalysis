'''Omar Alfredo Rodríguez-López''' (born September 1, 1975) is an American guitarist, songwriter, producer and filmmaker. He is known for being the guitarist, songwriter and band-leader of [[the Mars Volta]] from 2001 until their breakup in 2012, and is the guitarist for the [[alternative rock]] groups [[At the Drive-In]], [[Antemasque (band)|Antemasque]] and [[Bosnian Rainbows]]. He was also the bassist for the [[Dub music|dub]] band [[De Facto (band)|De Facto]]. He has embarked on a solo career, both in studio and [[Omar Rodríguez-López Tours|in concert]], frequently described as experimental, avant-garde and/or progressive. He has collaborated with numerous artists spanning from [[John Frusciante]] to [[El-P]].

==Biography==
Rodríguez-López was born in [[Puerto Rico]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/312534/omar-rodriguez-lopez/biography|title=Omar Rodriguez-Lopez - Biography - Billboard}}</ref> and grew up in [[El Paso, Texas]], and spent some of his childhood in [[South Carolina]]. He began playing the bass at age 12, but then switched to guitar at 15 because he "needed more strings".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mixonline.com/recording/interviews/audio_mars_volta |title=The Mars Volta |publisher=Mixonline.com |date=September 1, 2003 |access-date=March 16, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308215221/http://mixonline.com/recording/interviews/audio_mars_volta/ |archive-date=March 8, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> It was during this time that Rodríguez-López met [[Cedric Bixler-Zavala]] while practicing with friend [[Paul Hinojos]]. Since then Rodríguez-López has spent most of his career living and working with his close friend Bixler-Zavala. During this time he frequently collaborated with his friends and future bandmates from [[El Paso]], which included people such as [[Paul Hinojos]], [[Cedric Bixler-Zavala]], [[Julio Venegas]] and the late [[Jeremy Michael Ward]]. He attended [[Coronado High School (El Paso, Texas)|Coronado High School]] in [[El Paso]]. He says he enjoys the company of his close friends and family when not fulfilling obligations to his many bands and projects. Rodríguez-López has been a [[vegetarian]] for most of his life.<ref>{{ cite web | access-date = May 6, 2017 | url = https://www.indiewire.com/2012/03/sxsw-12-interview-omar-rodriquez-lopez-talks-spirituality-storytelling-the-symbolism-of-los-chidos-253292/ | title = SXSW '12 Interview: Omar Rodriquez Lopez Talks Spirituality, Storytelling & The Symbolism Of 'Los Chidos' | first = Katie | last = Walsh | publication-date = March 19, 2012 | website = [[IndieWire]] | date = March 19, 2012 | location = Austin, Texas | url-status = live | archive-date = May 16, 2017 | archive-url = https://archive.today/20170516133346/http://www.indiewire.com/2012/03/sxsw-12-interview-omar-rodriquez-lopez-talks-spirituality-storytelling-the-symbolism-of-los-chidos-253292/ | df = mdy-all }}</ref>

===At the Drive-In (1996–2001, 2012–2018)===
{{Main|At the Drive-In}}
At 17, Rodríguez-López left El Paso to hitchhike around the country for a year in the early 1990s, during which he acquired an addiction to [[opiate]]s.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite web|url=https://harptimes.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220173854/http://harpmagazine.com/articles/detail.cfm?article_id=4807|url-status=dead|title=Harp Times - Get the latest information and the best ideas just for you|archive-date=February 20, 2009|website=harptimes.com|access-date=November 15, 2019}}</ref> Eventually he got in touch with friend [[Cedric Bixler-Zavala]] who suggested he come back to El Paso. With the help of Bixler-Zavala, he was able to return to El Paso where he could begin to reclaim his life from addiction and join [[At the Drive-In]] as backup vocalist and bass guitarist. After receiving a record deal with [[Flipside Records]] and recording ''[[Acrobatic Tenement]]'' with the band, he became their full-time bassist before switching to guitar. After several years and two more critically acclaimed albums, for a variety of reasons, Rodríguez-López and Bixler-Zavala left At the Drive-In and the band went on "indefinite hiatus". The remaining members, [[Paul Hinojos]], [[Tony Hajjar]], and [[Jim Ward (musician)|Jim Ward]] went on to form [[Sparta (band)|Sparta]] while the duo focused on other projects.

On January 9, 2012, At the Drive-In announced that they were reforming for a tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/breaking_news_at_the_drive_in_to_reunite |title= BREAKING NEWS: At The Drive-In to reunite |publisher=Alternative Press |date=January 9, 2012 |access-date=January 9, 2012}}</ref>

===The Mars Volta (2001–2012)===
{{Main|The Mars Volta}}
They refocused their efforts on the dub outfit called [[De Facto (band)|De Facto]], which also included [[Jeremy Michael Ward]] and [[Isaiah "Ikey" Owens]], and which they had started years before while still in At the Drive-In. Eventually the same collective of musicians in De Facto would be expanded into Rodríguez-López's new band, [[The Mars Volta]]. Once again starting from scratch he wrote and toured with the band which consumed almost all his time and money.

On May 25, 2003 less than a month before the release of their first full-length album, ''[[De-Loused in the Comatorium]]'', bandmate and close friend Jeremy Ward was found dead of a heroin overdose. This event, coupled with the memories of the suicide of his friend [[Julio Venegas]] years earlier, finally convinced both him and Bixler-Zavala to quit using opiates. Since then he has been clean and credited his newfound musical work ethic on his new lifestyle. The Mars Volta's second album, ''[[Frances the Mute]]'', would later be dedicated to Ward.

During the early years of the band he also worked on a low budget movie called ''A Manual Dexterity'' which starred Jeremy Ward. The soundtrack ''[[A Manual Dexterity: Soundtrack Volume 1]]'' was released in 2004. The release of the second volume, which was originally planned for Spring of 2005, and the film were both delayed indefinitely due to legal problems. Conflicts over ownership of certain footage and Rodríguez-López's reluctance to revisit the project which featured his late friend Jeremy Michael Ward were both cited as reasons for the delay.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web |url=http://www.themarsvoltaitalia.com/omar_eng.htm |title=Sito Italiano Non Ufficiale Dedicato Ai The Mars Volta |publisher=www.themarsvoltaitalia.com |access-date=March 31, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304150549/http://www.themarsvoltaitalia.com/omar_eng.htm |archive-date=March 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> However, Rodríguez-López stated that he does intend to release both Volume 2 and the film at some point in the future.

On February 8, 2009, he and his fellow Mars Volta bandmates won the Grammy for [[Best Hard Rock Performance]].

On January 23, 2013, the Mars Volta officially announced that they had broken up, following a series of tweets posted by Cedric Bixler-Zavala stating that he had departed the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1532230/the-mars-volta-break-up|title=The Mars Volta Break Up}}</ref> Their future was uncertain at this point, although Rodriguez-Lopez has not ruled out the possibility of reuniting in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1887451/omar-rodriguez-lopez-says-the-mars-volta-will-probably-reunite/news/|title=Omar Rodriguez-Lopez Says The Mars Volta Will Probably Reunite|date=July 12, 2016}}</ref>

===Omar Rodriguez Lopez Group (2005–2012, 2018)===
{{Main|Omar Rodriguez Lopez Group}}
In 2005 Rodríguez-López relocated to Amsterdam, where he eventually wrote and recorded four separate albums. His first solo project was the "Omar Rodríguez-López Quintet". Rodríguez-López played several live shows in Europe with his quintet, which in 2005 also included three members of the Mars Volta Group ([[Juan Alderete]], [[Marcel Rodríguez-López]] and [[Adrián Terrazas-González]]) and [[Money Mark]].

The songs featured on this tour later appeared on the album ''[[Omar Rodriguez (album)|Omar Rodriguez]]''. It was characterized by long, improvisational songs with [[Dutch language|Dutch]] titles and no lyrics. The Quintet also performed live with [[Damo Suzuki]], parts of which were recorded and incorporated into a 25-minute [[Extended play|EP]] titled ''[[Please Heat This Eventually]]'', which was released in 2007.

During this time Rodríguez-López was also working on the Mars Volta's 2006 record ''[[Amputechture]]'' and composing the score to the film [[El Búfalo de la Noche (film)|''El Búfalo de la Noche'']] simultaneously to his work with the quintet.

On May 29, 2007, ''[[Se Dice Bisonte, No Búfalo]]'' was released. It was the third full-length solo album by Rodríguez-López. It featured performances by Mars Volta members Cedric Bixler-Zavala, Marcel Rodríguez-López, Juan Alderete, Adrián Terrazas-González as well as cameos by Money Mark, John Frusciante, and John Theodore. It was written and recorded between 2005–2006 in California and Amsterdam.

The Quintet later resurfaced in 2007, now known as "The Rodríguez-López Group" to perform on the "white" stage at the [[Fuji Rock Festival]] in Japan on July 28.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Performing with the group for the first time were singer Cedric Bixler-Zavala and drummer [[Thomas Pridgen]].

===Solo releases (2004–present)===
On October 8, 2007 the EP ''Omar Rodriguez-Lopez & Lydia Lunch'', a collaboration with spoken word poet [[Lydia Lunch]], was released.<ref>News for July 12, 2007 http://www.goldstandardlabs.com/news.html</ref> ''The Apocalypse Inside of an Orange'' is a double LP featuring the original quintet and was released on vinyl November 20, 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://infrasonicsound.com/recording/discography/pete.html |title=Infrasonic Sound |publisher=Infrasonic Sound |access-date=March 31, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080710075706/http://infrasonicsound.com/recording/discography/pete.html |archive-date=July 10, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was also released for digital download. ''[[Calibration (album)|Calibration]]'', a record that Rodríguez-López recorded during his stay in Amsterdam, was released February 5, 2008. It was described as being influenced by [[electronic music]] and [[acid-jazz]].<ref name=autogenerated2 />

On June 10, 2008, a recording titled ''Omar Rodriguez-Lopez & Jeremy Michael Ward'' was released. It was a collaboration between the two and was recorded in 2001 before the formation of The Mars Volta. The LP consists of various ambient tracks based on field recordings in the musique concrète tradition. Rodríguez-López has continued to release a series of albums recorded in 2001 which include ''Absence Makes the Heart Grow Fungus'' and ''Minor Cuts and Scrapes in the Bushes Ahead'', both released in late 2008.

Another album, ''[[Old Money (album)|Old Money]]'' was released in October 2008, with a vinyl version becoming available in early 2009 on the [[Stones Throw]] record label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stonesthrow.com/news/2008/11/omar-rodriguez-lopez-releases-old-money-on-stones-throw |title=Omar Rodriguez Lopez releases Old Money on Stones Throw &#124; Stones Throw Records |publisher=Stonesthrow.com |access-date=March 16, 2011}}</ref> [[Sonny Kay]], co-owner of the former Gold Standard Labs label with Omar, created the album covers (and has done so for the majority of future Omar releases). Two Omar Rodríguez-López solo albums were released in Europe on January 26, 2009 from the Netherlands-based record label Willie Anderson Recordings: ''Megaritual'' and ''Despair''. ''Despair'' is best described as a [[field recording]], while ''Megaritual'' is a collaboration jam between Omar and his brother, [[Marcel Rodríguez-López]].

In mid-2009, a new entity has been created called [[El Grupo Nuevo de Omar Rodriguez Lopez]] (''the New Omar Rodriguez-Lopez Group'') to release the first in a series of three recordings completed in 2006. Thus far these recordings have only been known as the ''Omar and [[Zach Hill]] collaborations''. The first recording titled ''[[Cryptomnesia (album)|Cryptomnesia]]'' was released on May 5, 2009. Vocals written and performed by Bixler-Zavala were recorded in 2008. The lineup for this entity is: Omar Rodríguez-López on guitar, [[Cedric Bixler-Zavala]] on vocals, Zach Hill on drums, Jonathan Hischke on synth bass, and [[Juan Alderete]] on bass.

The Omar Rodriguez-Lopez Group toured Europe in March 2009, supported by Zechs Marquise.

At the end of 2009, Rodríguez-López released three albums, ''Los Sueños de un Hígado'', ''[[Xenophanes (album)|Xenophanes]]'' and ''[[Solar Gambling]]'' digitally through Rodríguez-López Productions. While ''Xenophanes'' was also released on CD and vinyl, ''Los Suenos De Un Higado'' and ''Solar Gambling'' only had a limited vinyl release. Rodríguez-López also created a video for "Asco Que Conmueve los Puntos Erógenos", from ''Xenophanes'', and posted it on YouTube on November 30, 2009.

In January 2010, ''Ciencia de los Inútiles'' was released under a new group, El Trio de Omar Rodriguez-Lopez. The trio features Rodríguez-López on acoustic guitar, [[Ximena Sariñana]] on vocals and Aaron Cruz on upright bass. A video for "Miércoles" was also released. In May 2010, he released a collaboration titled ''[[Omar Rodriguez-Lopez & John Frusciante]]'' with [[John Frusciante]], free of charge through his website, with the option to donate. All money raised will go to the Keep Music in Schools programs. On May 30, 2010, the album ''[[Sepulcros de Miel]]'' by [[Omar Rodriguez-Lopez Quartet]] was digitally released, which also featured Frusciante.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/Omar-Rodriguez-Lopez/223893116520?ref=ts |title=Niet compatibele browser |publisher=Facebook |access-date=March 16, 2011}}</ref>

The album ''[[Tychozorente]]'' was scheduled for release on November 1, 2010; however, it received an early release on September 14, 2010 as a digital download. Another album, titled ''Cizaña de los Amores'', was digitally released on October 11, 2010. CD and vinyl versions of both albums are only available in Europe. ''Mantra Hiroshima'', another Omar and Zach Hill collaboration, was digitally released on November 29, followed next day by ''Dōitashimashite'', album of live material recorded in September during the [[Omar Rodriguez-Lopez Group]]'s first US tour. A video for "Agua Dulce de Pulpo" from the album ''Un Escorpión Perfumado'' was also released during that period, and the album itself was released on December 20 in digital form, with CD and vinyl versions to follow.

On April 16, 2011, Omar released ''Telesterion'', a compilation album featuring 38 songs from Omar's solo albums. Although this has been the only release of 2011, other projects have been hinted at, such as ''Двойственность вздохов'' (Russian for ''Duality of Sighs''), a documentary about the Omar Rodriguez-Lopez Group's Russian mini-tour, directed by Omar and shot by Paco Ibarra.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rodriguezlopezproductions.com/%d0%b4%d0%b2%d0%be%d0%b9%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b2%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%bd%d0%be%d1%81%d1%82%d1%8c-%d0%b2%d0%b7%d0%b4%d0%be%d1%85%d0%b8/ |title=Двойственность вздохо « Rodriguez Lopez Productions |publisher=Rodriguezlopezproductions.com |date=December 28, 2010 |access-date=March 16, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105120540/http://rodriguezlopezproductions.com/%D0%B4%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B9%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C-%D0%B2%D0%B7%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%85%D0%B8/ |archive-date=January 5, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The Vinyl edition of ''Telesterion'' also contained artwork for 6 solo albums that have yet to be released, and featured a new track, "Cásate Colmillo", off of an album supposedly titled ''The Somnambulis.''

On July 7, 2016, Ipecac Records announced that they would release 12 albums by Omar, fortnightly, until December 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ipecac.com/news|title=Ipecac Recordings - News|first=Andy|last=Couch}}</ref> They were recorded in the period 2008–2013 and one featured The Mars Volta line-up and a guest appearance by John Frusciante.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1888421/forthcoming-omar-rodriguez-lopez-album-features-original-mars-volta-lineup-john-frusciante/news/|title=Forthcoming Omar Rodriguez-Lopez Album Features Original Mars Volta Lineup & John Frusciante|date=July 16, 2016}}</ref> The first album ''Sworn Virgins'' was released digitally on July 15, 2016, and featured the single "To Kill a Chi Chi".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7439058/omar-rodriguez-lopez-mars-volta-john-frusciante-album|title=Omar Rodriguez-Lopez Releasing Album Recorded With Original Mars Volta Lineup, John Frusciante|access-date=2016-07-17}}</ref> Recorded in El Paso and [[Zapopan]], the other titles include ''Corazones'', ''Blind Worms Pious Swine'', ''Arañas En La Sombra'', ''Umbrella Mistress'', ''El Bien Y Mal Nos Une'', ''Cell Phone Bikini'', ''[[Infinity Drips]]'', ''[[Weekly Mansions]]'', ''[[Zapopan (album)|Zapopan]]'', ''[[Nom De Guerre Cabal]]'', and ''[[Some Need It Lonely]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1886798/at-the-drive-ins-omar-rodriguez-lopez-will-release-a-dozen-solo-albums-before-the-end-of-the-year/news/|title=At The Drive-In's Omar Rodríguez-López Will Release A Dozen Solo Albums Before The End Of The Year|date=July 8, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.mxdwn.com/2016/07/08/news/omar-rodriguez-lopez-to-release-12-solo-albums-on-ipecac-records-before-years-end/|title=Omar Rodriguez-Lopez To Release 12 Solo Albums On Ipecac Records Before Year's End - mxdwn.com|date=July 8, 2016}}</ref>

===Bosnian Rainbows and Antemasque (2012–present)===
{{Main|Bosnian Rainbows}}
On April 8, 2014, Omar announced a new musical project called [[Antemasque (band)|Antemasque]] with former At the Drive-In and Mars Volta bandmates [[Cedric Bixler-Zavala]] (vocals) and [[David Elitch]] (drums) as well as [[Flea (musician)|Flea]], the bassist for the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]. The group released their first song, "4AM".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/09/flea-red-hot-chili-peppers-mars-volta-antemasque|title=RHCP bassist Flea forms Antemasque supergroup with the Mars Volta|author=Ben Beaumont-Thomas|date=April 9, 2014|work=The Guardian|access-date=2014-04-09}}</ref> Flea said that Antemasque is a project between Omar and Cedric, and that he is only a contributing artist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/flea333/status/454473682706903040|title=To clarify: I am not a member of antemasque|author=Flea333|date=April 10, 2014|publisher=Twitter|access-date=2014-04-10}}</ref>

In 2012, with Mars Volta going on hiatus, Rodríguez-López formed a solo band that eventually took the name Bosnian Rainbows. It consists of Deantoni Parks (drums, keyboards), Teri Gender Bender (vocals) and Nicci Kasper (keyboards).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1549951/omar-rodriguez-lopez-on-bosnian-rainbows-lessons-from-at-the-drive-in-mars|title=Omar Rodriguez-Lopez on Bosnian Rainbows, Lessons from At The Drive-In, Mars Volta}}</ref> They released one [[Bosnian Rainbows (album)|self-titled album]] in June 2013. {{as of|2018|df=US}}, both Bosnian Rainbows and Antemasque have essentially been put on hold due to touring commitments of At the Drive-In.

==Other media==
Aside from music, Rodríguez-López is also involved in filmmaking and photography. Beginning in his [[At the Drive-in]] days he started to document many kinds of things: live shows, sound checks, dressing rooms, hotels, airport lounges, sightseeing, encounters with colleagues. Since 2001 he has produced many films, of which  ''[[The Sentimental Engine Slayer]]'' was the first to be released. Rodríguez-López wrote, directed, produced and starred in the film, which was premiered at the [[International Film Festival Rotterdam]] in February 2010 and saw the DVD release in January 2013. Another film directed by Omar, ''Los Chidos'', was premiered in March 2012 at [[SXSW]]. Furthermore, Rodríguez-López and [[Hans Zimmer]] worked together to compose the score for the 2009 [[Guillermo Arriaga]] film ''[[The Burning Plain]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Elley |first=Derek |url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117938111.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 |title=The Burning Plain |publisher=Variety.com |date=August 29, 2008 |access-date=March 31, 2011}}</ref> The film was his second collaboration with the writer/director after scoring the 2007 film ''[[El Búfalo de la Noche (film)|El Búfalo de la Noche]]'' with the Mars Volta; in addition to some original material, the score also includes material used in ''[[Amputechture]]''. Rodríguez-López's first photo book, ''Hunters in High Heels'' documenting the years from 2000 to 2006, was slated to release in 2013 but was since postponed indefinitely due to unknown reasons.

==Musicianship==

===Style===
Rodríguez-López's compositional and playing style is characterized by, among other factors, riffs, melodies based in minor modes, changing meters, unresolving [[consonance and dissonance|dissonances]] (in particular a heavy use of the [[tritone]]), [[Chromatic scale|chromatic passages]], and lengthy [[improvisation]]. He is also known for his vast array of [[effects pedals]]; in a feature appearing in [[Guitar World]], Rodríguez-López stated that he "began to see effects as allies in my war against the guitar". In that interview he also stated that he hated the guitar for a very long time. He only utilized it because it was the instrument his bandmates could "relate to". He said he "wrestled" guitar by adding effects and playing oddly to attempt "making it sound like anything besides this thing I hate—the guitar!". However, he claimed to feel more comfortable with the instrument on ''[[Amputechture]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.guitarworld.com/article/the_new_guitar_gods_mars_volta |title=The New Guitar Gods – The Mars Volta |publisher=Guitarworld.com |date=November 7, 2008 |access-date=March 31, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014021900/http://www.guitarworld.com/article/the_new_guitar_gods_mars_volta |archive-date=October 14, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Equipment===
Omar has endorsed Ibanez guitars since the Mars Volta's inception in 2001. Previously he used Squier Super-Sonic guitars while playing with At the Drive-In. He also recorded ''[[De-Loused in the Comatorium]]'' with a Gibson SG II from the early 1970s which he also used in live improv shows with [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] and [[John Frusciante]]. In 2008, Ibanez released the ORM-1 Omar Rodriguez-Lopez signature guitar, which was produced through 2012. He uses Seymour Duncan JB Jr. pickups as well. Although he tunes to E standard tuning, Omar uses Ernie Ball .013-.056 gauge strings with a wound G string, saying that "they feel more real than the really thin ones". Omar also plays through an Orange Rockerverb combo amp as well. In recent years, Omar has taken a minimalist approach to his pedals, which at one point was a very complex setup. During the Mars Volta's 2011 tour with [[Soundgarden]], he used a Boss DD5 Digital Delay, an MXR Phase 90, an Electro-Harmonix Memory Boy analog delay, a Boss PS-6 Harmonist, a Line 6 M9 Stompbox Modeler, an MXR M133 Micro Amp, an Ibanez WH10V2 wah-wah, an Ibanez TC7 tri-mode chorus, and a Line 6 DL4 delay modeler.

During the Mars Volta's final shows and At the Drive-In's reunion tour, Rodriguez-Lopez switched back to a full-sized Ibanez Jetking guitar, although retaining his preferred single-pickup and volume knob configuration and 24" neck scale. In a recent interview with [[TC Electronic]], he is seen using a blue Ibanez Jetking with two full-size humbuckers.

Most recently, while performing with Bosnian Rainbows, Rodriguez-Lopez began to use a mid-1960s era left-handed Supro 3/4 scale guitar with a single pickup in the bridge position. Shortly afterwards, he was seen playing a custom Ibanez guitar that closely resembled his Supro. In addition, Rodriguez-Lopez now uses flatwound strings on his guitar. Rodriguez-Lopez's pedalboard for Bosnian Rainbows consisted of a Boss TU-3 Chromatic Tuner, an Empress Superdelay, a Blackout Effects Whetstone analog phaser, a Catalinbread Semaphore tremolo pedal, a Boss DD-5 Digital Delay, an [[EarthQuaker Devices]] Rainbow Machine, an Empress Fuzz pedal, a Catalinbread Calisto chorus/vibrato pedal, and a [[Boss SL-20 slicer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEwb-IZuj8|title=Rig Tour: Omar Rodríguez-López from Bosnian Rainbows|last=TotalGuitar|date=July 3, 2013|via=YouTube}}</ref>

===As producer===
Rodríguez-López is also notable for his recording, producing and songwriting techniques.<ref>{{cite web |last=Freeman |first=Phil |url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/archives/2009/06/interview_omar.php |title=Interview: Omar Rodriguez-Lopez on Mars Volta's Fifth Album Octahedron and His Solo Record Cryptomnesia – New York Music – Sound of the City |publisher=Blogs.villagevoice.com |date=June 22, 2009 |access-date=March 16, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818004517/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/archives/2009/06/interview_omar.php |archive-date=August 18, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> He has claimed that he is "ignorant of music theory" and that thus he lacks knowledge in writing music in standard notation, claiming that his songwriting "comes from emotion completely".<ref>{{cite web|last=Varga |first=George |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20040401/news_lz1w1speakers.html |title=Speakers of the house &#124; The San Diego Union-Tribune |publisher=Signonsandiego.com |date=April 1, 2004 |access-date=March 31, 2011}}</ref> Rodríguez-López claims to write all of the music for his projects, then dictates the performance to the musicians involved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/features/news/2007/05/070521_omar/ |title=Omar Rodriguez-Lopez Chats Projects, Mars Volta |publisher=SPIN.com |date=May 21, 2007 |access-date=March 31, 2011}}</ref>

In addition to his producing credits with the Mars Volta and his solo albums, he also produced the only LP from the defunct LA-based band Radio Vago and in 2009, handled the production of a recording titled "Terra Incognita" from actress/singer [[Juliette Lewis]]' band The New Romantiques. Omar also produced (as well as contributed bass to) ''[[Sin Sin Sin (album)|Sin Sin Sin]]'', the debut LP from the band [[Le Butcherettes]], which was released in 2011 on Rodriguez-Lopez Productions.
