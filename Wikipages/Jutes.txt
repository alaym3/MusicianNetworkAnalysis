[[File:Jutland Peninsula map.PNG|thumb|The [[Jutland Peninsula]], homeland of the Jutes]]
The '''Jutes''' ({{IPAc-en|dʒ|uː|t|s}}), '''Iuti''', or '''Iutæ''' ({{lang-da|Jyde}}, {{lang-ang|Ēotas}}) were one of the [[Scandinavia|Nordic]] tribes who settled in [[Great Britain]] after the [[end of Roman rule in Britain|departure]] of the [[Roman Empire|Romans]]. According to [[Bede]], they were one of the three most powerful [[Germanic people|Germanic]] nations, along with the [[Angles]] and the [[Saxons]].

The Jutes are believed to have originated from the namesaked [[Jutland Peninsula]] (then called ''Iutum'' in [[Latin language|Latin]]) and part of the [[North Frisia]]n coast, consisting of the mainland of modern [[Denmark]] and the [[Southern Schleswig]] and [[North Frisia]] regions of modern [[Germany]].

The Jutes invaded and settled in [[southern Britain]] in the late 4th century during the [[Migration Period]], as part of a larger wave of [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|Germanic settlement into Britain]]. The Jutes are also speculated to have spread to [[Savonia (historical province)|Savonia]], [[Finland]], as the [[Finland|Finnish]] surname ''[[Juutilainen]]'' (English: Juutila), which comes from the word "juutti", refers to the Jutes.{{sfn| Vilkuna|1988|loc=Juutilainen}}

During the period after the Roman occupation and before the Norman conquest, people of Germanic descent arrived in England.{{sfn|Campbell|John|Wormald|1991|p=20 & p. 240}} The [[Anglo Saxon Chronicle]] provides what historians regard as foundation legends for Anglo-Saxon settlement.{{sfn|Jones|1998|p=71}}{{sfn|Welch|2007|p=190}}

The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle describes how the brothers [[Hengist and Horsa]] in the year 449 were invited to Sub-Roman Britain, by [[Vortigern]] to assist his forces in fighting the [[Picts]]. They landed at Wippidsfleet ([[Ebbsfleet, Thanet|Ebbsfleet]]), and went on to defeat the Picts wherever they fought them. Hengist and Horsa sent word home to Germany asking for assistance. Their request was granted and support arrived. Afterward, more people arrived in Britain from "the three powers of Germany; the Old Saxons, the Angles, and the Jutes". The Saxons populated [[Essex]], [[Sussex]] and [[Wessex]]; the Jutes [[Kent]], the [[Isle of Wight]] and [[Hampshire]]; and the Angles [[East Anglia]], [[Mercia]] and [[Northumbria]] (leaving their original homeland, [[Angeln]], deserted).{{sfn|Giles|1914|loc=AD 449}}

The ''Anglo Saxon Chronicle'' also lists ''Wihtgar'' and ''Stuf'' as founders of the ''Wihtwara'' (Isle of Wight) and a man named ''Port'' and his two sons ''Bieda'' and ''Maeglaof'' as founders of the ''Meonwara'' (southern Hampshire). {{sfn|Esmonde Cleary|1990|p=171}}{{sfn|Giles|1914|loc=AD 514 to 534}} In 686 Bede tells us that Jutish Hampshire extended to the western edge of the [[New Forest]] ; however, that seems to include another Jutish people, the [[New Forest#History|Ytene]],{{efn|''Ytene'' is the [[genitive plural]] of ''Yt'' meaning "Jute", i.e. "of the Jutes".{{sfn|Stenton|1971|p=23}}}}{{efn|[[Florence of Worcester]] talks about how [[William Rufus]] was slain in the New Forest and that in the English tongue (''Nova Foresta que lingua Anglorum'') the term for the New Forest was ''Ytene'' . {{sfn|Chambers|1912| pp=231-241}}}} and it is not certain that these two territories formed a continuous coastal block.{{sfn|Yorke|1990|p=132}}

In his [[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]], [[Bede]] said that:
{{quote|Those who came over were of the three most powerful nations of Germany—Saxons, Angles, and Jutes. From the Jutes are descended the people of Kent, and of the Isle of Wight, and those also in the province of the West Saxons who are to this day called Jutes, seated opposite to the Isle of Wight.|source={{harvnb|Bede|1910|loc=1.15}}}}

The Jutish kingdom{{efn|''Iutarum natio''{{sfn|Yorke|1995 |pp=37–39}}}} in Hampshire that Bede describes has various placenames that identify the locations as Jutish. These include [[Bishopstoke]] (''Ytingstoc'') and the [[River Meon|Meon Valley]] (''Ytedene'').{{sfn|Yorke|1995 |pp=37–39}}

Before the 7th century, there is a dearth of contemporary written material about the Anglo-Saxons' arrival.{{efn|One notable exception is that of [[Gildas]]}} Most material that does exist was written several hundred years after the events. The earlier dates for the beginnings of settlement, provided by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, have not been supported by the archaeology.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=65}}{{sfn|Myers|1989|p=5}} Because of the lack of written history before the 7th century it has made it difficult for historians to produce a definitive story. One alternative hypothesis to the foundation legend, based on the archaeology, suggests that because previously inhabited sites on the Frisian and north German coasts had been rendered uninhabitable by flooding there was a mass migration of families and communities to Britain. The British provided land for the refugees to settle on in return for peaceful coexistence and military cooperation.{{sfn|Hawkes|1982|p=65}}

Ship construction in the 2nd or 3rd century adopted the use of iron fastenings, instead of the old sewn fastenings, to hold together the plank built boats of the Jutland peninsula. This enabled them to build stronger sea going vessels. Vessels going from Jutland to Britain probably would have sailed along the coastal regions of Lower Saxony and the Netherlands before crossing the channel. This was because navigation techniques of the time required the ship to be moored up overnight. Marine archaeology has suggested that migrating ships would have sheltered in various river estuaries on the route. Artefacts and parts of ships, of the period, have been found that support this theory.{{sfn|Crumlin-Pedersen|1990|pp=98–116}}It is likely that the Jutes initially inhabited Kent and from there they occupied the Isle of Wight, southern Hampshire and also possibly the area around Hastings in East Sussex ([[Haestingas]]).{{sfn|Coates|1979|pp=263–264}}{{sfn|Myers|1989|pp=144–149}}{{sfn|Welch|1978|p=34}}

===Mercian and South Saxon takeover===
In Kent, [[Hlothhere]] had been ruler since 673/4. He must have come into conflict with [[Mercia]], because in 676 the Mercian king [[Æthelred of Mercia|Æthelred]] invaded Kent and according to [[Bede]]:  
{{quote|In the year of our Lord's incarnation 676, when Ethelred, king of the Mercians, ravaged Kent with a powerful army, and profaned churches and monasteries, without regard to religion, or the fear of God, he among the rest destroyed the city of Rochester|source={{harvnb|Bede|1910|loc=1.15}}}}

In 681 [[Wulfhere of Mercia]] advanced into southern Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. Shortly after he gave the Isle of Wight and Meonwara to [[Æthelwealh of Sussex]].{{sfn|Bede|1910|loc=4.13}}{{sfn|Kirby|2000|p=97}}

In Kent, Eadric was for a time co-ruler {{efn|There is no certain evidence for Eadric ruling  with his uncle. There is a charter where they are both jointly named but it may just have been a conflation of two earlier separate codes {{sfn|Kirby|2000|p=99}}}}  alongside his uncle Hlothhere with [[Law of Hlothhere and Eadric|a law code]] being issued in their names. Ultimately, Eadric revolted against his uncle and with help from a South Saxon army in about 685, was able to kill Hlothhere, and replace him as ruler of Kent.{{sfn|Yorke|1990|pp=29-30}}

===West Saxon invasion===
In the 680s the [[Kingdom of Wessex]] was in the ascendant, the alliance between the [[South Saxons]] and the Mercians and their control of southern England, put the West Saxons under pressure.{{sfn|Kirby|2000|pp=97-99}} Their king Caedwalla, probably concerned about Mercian and South Saxon influence in Southern England, conquered the land of the South Saxons and took over the Jutish areas in Hampshire and the [[Isle of Wight]]. Bede describes how [[Caedwalla]] brutally suppressed the South Saxons and attempted to slaughter the Jutes of the Isle of Wight and replace them with people from "his own province,” but maintained that he was unable to do so, and Jutes remained a majority on the island.{{efn|Some have described this act as "ethnic cleansing". The historian [[Robin Bush]] was cited in the BBC Radio 4 "Who were the Jutes". Making History Programme 11 (2008), as being the principle advocate for this assertion.{{sfn|BBC|2008}}}}{{sfn|Bede|1910|loc=4.15}} 
{{quote|"AFTER Coedwalla had possessed himself of the kingdom of the [[Gewissae]], he also took the Isle of Wight, which till then was entirely given over to idolatry, and by cruel slaughter endeavoured to destroy all the inhabitants thereof, and to place in their stead people from his own province.."|source={{harvnb|Bede|1910|loc=4.16}}}}

Caedwalla killed [[Aruald|Aruald, the king of the Isle of Wight]]. Aruald's two younger brothers, who were heirs to the throne, escaped from the island but were hunted down and found at [[South Stoneham|Stoneham]], [[Hampshire]]. They were killed on Cædwalla's orders. The Isle of Wight was then permanently under West Saxon control and the ''Meonwara'' was integrated into Wessex.{{sfn|Bede|1910|loc=4.16}}{{sfn|Yorke|1995|p=66}} Caedwalla also invaded Kent and installed his brother Mul as leader. However it was not long before Mul and twelve others were burnt to death by the Kentishmen.{{sfn|Yorke|1990|pp=29-30}} After Caedwalla was superseded by [[Ine of Wessex]], Kent agreed to pay compensation to Wessex for the death of Mul, but they retained their independence.{{sfn|Yorke|1995|p=66}}

==Influences and culture==
When the Jutish [[kingdom of Kent]] was founded, around the middle of the 5th century, Roman ways and influences must have still had a strong presence. The Roman settlement of ''[[Durovernum Cantiacorum]]'' became Canterbury. The people of Kent were described as ''Cantawara'', a Germanised form of the Latin ''Cantiaci''.{{sfn|Campbell|John|Wormald|1991|pp=38–44}}

Although not all historians accept Bede's scheme for the settlement of Britain into Anglian, Jutish and Saxon areas as perfectly accurate,{{sfn| Hawkes|1982|p=67}} the archaeological evidence indicates that the peoples of west Kent were
culturally distinct from those in the east of Kent. With west Kent sharing the 'Saxon' characteristics of its neighbours, in the south east of England.{{sfn|Welch|2007|p= 209}} Brooches and [[bracteate]]s found in east Kent, the Isle of Wight and southern Hampshire showed a strong Frankish{{efn|Some ancient sources have suggested that the Franks may have had overlordship of Kent at some point.{{sfn|Stenton|1971|p=14}}{{sfn|Blair|2006|pp=39–41}}{{sfn|Yorke|1990|pp=26–27}}}} and North Sea influence from the mid-fifth century to the late sixth century compared to north German styles found elsewhere in Anglo-Saxon England.{{sfn|Yorke|1990|pp=26–27}} {{sfn|Welch|2007|p= 209}}{{sfn|Smith|1937|pp=51-52}} There is discussion about who crafted the jewellery (found in the archaeological sites of Kent). Suggestions include crafts people who had been trained in the Roman workshops of northern Gaul or the Rhineland. It is also possible that those artisans went on to develop their own individual style.{{sfn|Hills|1979|pp= 297–329}} By the late 6th century grave goods indicate that west Kent had adopted the distinctive east Kent material culture.{{sfn|Welch|2007|p= 209}}

The Frankish princess [[Bertha of Kent|Bertha]] arrived in Kent around 580 to marry the king [[Æthelberht of Kent]]. Bertha was already a Christian and had brought a bishop, [[Liudhard]], with her across the Channel. Æthelberht rebuilt an old Romano-British structure and dedicated it to [[St Martin's Church, Canterbury|St Martin]] allowing Bertha to continue practising her Christian faith. {{sfn|Blair|2006|pp=70-71}}{{sfn|Bede|1910|loc=2.2}} In 597 [[Pope Gregory I]] sent [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]] to Kent, on a mission to convert the Anglo-Saxons, {{sfn|Bede|1910|loc=1.XXV}}{{sfn|Bede|1910|loc=2.2}}{{sfn|Charles-Edwards|2003|pp=128–29}} There are suggestions that Æthelberht had already been baptised when he "courteously received" the popes mission. Æthelberht was the first of the Anglo-Saxon rulers to be baptised.{{sfn|Kirby|2000|p=28}}{{sfn|Bede|1910|loc=1.XXV}}

The simplified Christian burial was introduced at this time. Christian graves were usually aligned East to West, whereas with some exceptions pagan burial sites were not.{{sfn|Welch|1992|pp=74–76}} The lack of archaeological grave evidence in the land of the ''Haestingas'' is seen as supporting the hypothesis that the peoples there would have been Christian Jutes who had migrated from Kent.{{sfn|Welch|1978|p=34}} In contrast to Kent, the Isle of Wight was the last area of Anglo-Saxon England to be evangelised in 686.{{sfn|Blair|2006|p=167}}{{sfn|Bede|1910|loc=4.16}}

The Jutes used a system of [[partible inheritance]] known as [[gavelkind]] and this was practised in Kent until the 20th century. The custom of gavelkind was also found in other areas of Jutish settlement.{{efn|For example, in the area of East Sussex that became the [[Rape of Hastings]] and was occupied by the people known as the ''Haestingas ''.{{sfn|Barr-Hamilton|1953|pp=130–135}}}}{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|loc=[[s:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Sussex#166|Sussex]]}}{{sfn|Myers|1989|pp=144–149}} In England and Wales gavelkind was abolished by the [[Administration of Estates Act 1925]].{{sfn|Watson|2001||p=53}} Before abolition in 1925, all land in Kent was presumed to be held by gavelkind until the contrary was proved.{{sfn|Watson|2001||p=53}} The popular reason given for the practice remaining so long, is due to the "Swanscombe Legend", according to this, Kent made a deal with [[William the Conqueror]] whereby he would allow them to keep local customs in return for peace.{{sfn|Smith|1998|pp=85–103}}

== Homeland and historical accounts ==
[[File:Anglo-Saxon Homelands and Settlements.svg|left|thumb|300px|The early migrations of Germanic peoples from coastal regions of northern Europe to areas of modern-day England. The settlement regions correspond roughly to later dialect divisions of Old English.]]

Although historians are confident of where the Jutes settled in England, they are divided on where they actually came from.{{efn|The historian Barbara Yorke, suggests that the Jutes maybe a British construct rather than an identifiable European community.{{sfn|BBC|2008}}}}{{sfn|Martin|1971|pp=83–104}}

The chroniclers, [[Procopius]], [[Constantius of Lyon]], [[Gildas]], Bede, [[Nennius]], and also the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]], [[Alfred the Great]] and [[Asser]] provide the names of tribes who settled Britain during the mid-fifth century, and in their combined testimony, the four tribes mentioned are the ''[[Angles|Angli]]'', ''[[Saxons|Saxones]]'', ''Iutae'' and ''[[Frisii]]''.{{efn|English:   [[Angles]], [[Saxons]], Jutes, [[Frisians]].}}{{sfn|Martin|1971|pp=83–104}}

The Roman historian [[Tacitus]] refers to a people called the ''Eudoses,''{{sfn|Tacitus|1876|loc=Ch. XL}} a tribe who possibly developed into the Jutes.{{sfn|Martin|1971|pp=83–104}}

The Jutes have also been identified with the ''Eotenas'' (''ēotenas'') involved in the Frisian conflict with the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] as described in the [[Finnesburg Fragment|Finnesburg episode]] in the Old English poem ''[[Beowulf]]''.{{sfn|Stuhmiller|1999|pp=7–14}} [[Theudebert]], king of the Franks wrote to the Emperor [[Justinian]] and in the letter claimed that he had lordship over a nation called the ''Saxones Eucii'' . The Eucii are thought to have been Jutes and may have been the same as a little-documented tribe called the ''Euthiones''.{{sfn|Stenton|1971|p=14}} The Euthiones are mentioned in a poem by [[Venantius Fortunatus]] (583) as being under the suzerainty of [[Chilperic I]] of the Franks. The Euthiones were located somewhere in northern [[Francia]], modern day [[Flanders]], an area of the European mainland opposite to Kent.{{sfn|Stenton|1971|p=14}}{{sfn| Kane|2019|p=441}}

Bede inferred that the Jutish homeland was on the Jutland peninsula. However analysis of grave goods, of the time, have provided a link between East Kent, south Hampshire and the Isle of Wight but little evidence of any link with Jutland. {{sfn|Lavelle|Stoodley|2020|page=70-94}} There is evidence that the Jutes who migrated to England came from northern Francia or from Frisia.{{sfn|Martin|1971|pages= 83–104}} Historians have posited that Jutland was the homeland of the Jutes, but when the Danes invaded the Jutland Peninsula in about AD 200 some of the Jutes would have been absorbed by the Danish culture and others may have migrated to northern Francia and Frisia.{{sfn|Martin|1971|pages= 83–104}}

There is a [[Geats#Identity of the Gēatas|hypothesis]], suggested by Pontus Fahlbeck in 1884, that the [[Geats]] were Jutes. According to this hypothesis the Geats resided in southern Sweden and also in Jutland (where Beowulf would have lived).{{efn|The hypothesis resulted in a debate that lasted for over 50 years. However the current consensus is that Fahlbeck was wrong.{{sfn|Rix|2015|pp=197-199}}{{sfn|Niles|Bjork|1997|pp=213-214}}}}{{sfn|Niles|2007|p=135}}

The evidence adduced for this hypothesis includes:
* primary sources referring to the Geats (''Geátas'') by alternative names such as ''Iútan'', ''Iótas'', and ''Eotas''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|loc=[[s:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/English Language|English Language]]}}
* [[Asser]] in his ''Life of Alfred'' (Chapter 2) identifies the Jutes with the Goths{{efn|Keynes and Lapidge posited that Asser  incorrectly suggested that the Goths were ethnically the same as the Jutes, when in fact they were not.{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|pages=229-230 n.8}}}} (in a passage claiming that [[Alfred the Great]] was descended, through his mother, [[Osburga]], from the ruling dynasty of the Jutish kingdom of [[Wihtwara]], on the Isle of Wight).{{sfn|Keynes|Lapidge|1983|loc=p. 68 Ch 2}}
* the [[Gutasaga]] is a saga that charts the history of Gotland prior to Christianity. It is an appendix to the ''[[Gutalagen|Guta Lag]]''&nbsp;(Gotland law) written in the thirteenth or fourteenth century. It says that some inhabitants of [[Gotland]] left for [[Continental Europe|mainland Europe]]. Large burial sites attributable to either Goths or [[Gepids]] were found in the 19th century near Willenberg, Prussia.{{efn|Willenberg became [[Wielbark, Pomeranian Voivodeship|Wielbark]] in Poland, after 1945.{{sfn|Andrzejowski|2019|pp=227-239}}}}{{sfn|Andrzejowski|2019|pp=227-239}}

However, the tribal names possibly were confused in the above sources in both ''Beowulf'' (8th – 11th centuries) and ''[[Widsith]]'' (late 7th – 10th century). The ''Eoten'' (in the [[Finn (Frisian)|Finn]] passage) are clearly distinguished from the ''Geatas''.{{sfn|Chambers|1912|pp=231-241}}{{sfn|Rix|2015|pp=197-199}}

===Language and writing===
The [[runes|runic alphabet]] is thought to have originated in the Germanic homelands that were in contact with the Roman Empire, and as such was a response to the Latin alphabet. In fact some of the runes emulated their Latin counterpart. The runic alphabet crossed the sea with the Anglo-Saxons and there have been examples, of its use, found in Kent.{{sfn|Haigh|1872|pp=164-270}}{{sfn|Charles-Edwards|2003|p=193}} As the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were evangelised the script of the [[Latin alphabet]] was introduced by [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish Christian missionaries]]. However, they ran into problems when they were unable to find a Latin equivalent to some of the Anglo-Saxon phonetics. They overcame this by modifying the Latin alphabet to include some runic characters. This became the [[Old English Latin alphabet]]. The runic characters were eventually replaced by characters that we are familiar with today, by the end of the 14th century.{{sfn|Charles-Edwards|2003|p=193}}{{sfn|Crystal|1987|p=203}}

The language that the Anglo-Saxon settlers spoke is known as [[Old English]]. There are four main dialectal forms, namely [[Mercian (Old English)|Mercian]], [[Northumbrian (Old English)|Northumbrian]], [[West Saxon (Old English)|West Saxon]] and [[Kentish (Old English)|Kentish]].{{sfn|Campbell|1959|p=4}} Based on Bede's description of where the Jutes settled, Kentish was spoken in what are now the modern-day counties of [[Kent]], [[Surrey]], southern [[Hampshire]] and the [[Isle of Wight]].{{sfn|Bede|1910|loc=2.5}} However historians are divided on what dialect it would have been and where it originated from. {{sfn|Derolez|1974|pp=1-14}} The Jutish peninsula has been seen by historians as a pivotal region between the [[North Germanic languages|Northern]] and the [[West Germanic languages|Western Germanic dialects]]. It has not been possible to prove whether Jutish has always been a Scandinavian dialect which later became heavily inﬂuenced by West Germanic dialects, or whether Jutland was originally part of the West Germanic [[dialectal continuum]].{{sfn|Braunmüller|2013|pp=52-72}} An analysis of the Kentish dialect by linguists indicates that there was a similarity between Kentish and Frisian. Whether the two can be classed as the same dialect or whether Kentish was a version of Jutish, heavily influenced by Frisian and other dialects, is open to conjecture.{{sfn|Derolez|1974|pp=1-14}}{{sfn|DeCamp|1958|pp= 232-44}}
