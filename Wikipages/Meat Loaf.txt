He is noted for his powerful, wide-ranging voice and theatrical live shows. His ''Bat Out of Hell'' trilogy—''[[Bat Out of Hell]]'', ''[[Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell]]'', and ''[[Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose]]''—has sold more than 65 million albums worldwide.<ref name="Steinman">{{cite web |url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/newsnotes.htm |title=News & Notes |date=February 28, 2007 |author-link=Steinman |first=Jim |last=Steinman |access-date=July 6, 2009 |archive-date=June 22, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622111640/http://www.jimsteinman.com/newsnotes.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> More than four decades after its release, the first album still sells an estimated 200,000 copies annually and stayed on the charts for over nine years, making it one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums in history]].<ref name=":0">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/soldonsong/songlibrary/batoutofhell.shtml BBC – radio 2 – Sold on Song – Top 100 – no 8 – 'Bat Out Of Hell '].

After the commercial success of ''Bat Out of Hell'' and ''Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell'', and earning a [[Grammy Award for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance]] for the song "[[I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)|I'd Do Anything for Love]]", Meat Loaf nevertheless experienced some difficulty establishing a steady career within the United States.

==Career==
===Early career===
In Los Angeles, Aday formed his first band, Meat Loaf Soul, after a nickname coined by his football coach because of his weight.<ref name=":1" /> He was immediately offered three recording contracts, all of which he turned down.<ref name="thebiographychannel.co.uk"/> Meat Loaf Soul's first gig was in [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]] in 1968 at the Cave, opening for [[Van Morrison]]'s band [[Them (band)|Them]] and [[Question Mark and the Mysterians]]. While performing their cover of the [[Howlin' Wolf]] song "[[Smokestack Lightning]]", the smoke machine they used made too much smoke and the club had to be cleared out. Later, the band was the opening act at [[California State University, Northridge|Cal State Northridge]] for [[Renaissance (band)|Renaissance]], [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]], and [[Janis Joplin]]. The band then underwent several changes of lead guitarists, changing the name of the band each time. The new names included Popcorn Blizzard and Floating Circus.<ref name="rickbozzo.com">{{cite web| url=http://www.rickbozzo.com/meatandme.html| title=Meat Loaf and Me| last=Bozzo| first=Rick| access-date=January 17, 2009}}</ref> As Floating Circus, they opened for [[the Who]], [[the Fugs]], [[the Stooges]], [[MC5]], [[Grateful Dead]], and [[the Grease Band]]. Their regional success led them to release a single, "Once Upon a Time", backed with "Hello". Then Meat Loaf joined the Los Angeles production of the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]''.<ref name="rickbozzo.com"/> Meat Loaf later stated that the biggest life struggle he had to overcome was not being taken seriously in the music industry. He compared his treatment to that of a "circus clown".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://zmonline.com/WhosOn/MorningCrew/Highlights/Detail.aspx?id=14469|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222100623/http://zmonline.com/WhosOn/MorningCrew/Highlights/Detail.aspx?id=14469|url-status=dead|title=Meat Loaf interview with ZM's Polly Gillespie|archive-date=December 22, 2010}}</ref>

===Stoney and Meat Loaf (1971)===
[[File:Meatloaf and Stoney 1971.JPG|thumb|Meat Loaf and Stoney ([[Shaun Murphy (singer)|Shaun Murphy]]), 1971.]]
With the publicity generated from ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', Meat Loaf was invited to record with [[Motown]]. They suggested he do a duet with [[Shaun Murphy (singer)|Shaun "Stoney" Murphy]], who had performed with him in ''Hair'', to which he agreed. The Motown production team in charge of the album wrote and selected the songs while Meat Loaf and Stoney came in only to lay down their vocals. The album, titled ''[[Stoney & Meatloaf]]'' (with Meat Loaf misspelled as one word) was completed in the summer of 1971 and released in September of that year. A single released in advance of the album, "What You See Is What You Get", reached number thirty-six on the Best Selling Soul Singles chart (the same chart is now titled [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]]) and seventy-one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. To support their album, Meat Loaf and Stoney toured with [[Jake Wade and the Soul Searchers]], opening for [[Richie Havens]], [[the Who]], [[the Stooges]], [[Bob Seger]], [[Alice Cooper]], and [[Rare Earth (band)|Rare Earth]]. Meat Loaf left soon after Motown replaced his and Stoney's vocals from the one song he liked, "Who Is the Leader of the People?" with new vocals by [[Edwin Starr]]. The album has been re-released after Meat Loaf's success, with Stoney's vocals removed. Meat Loaf's version of "Who Is the Leader of the People?" was released; however, the album failed.

In December 1972, Meat Loaf was in the original [[off-Broadway]] production of ''Rainbow'' at the Orpheum Theatre in New York.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/meat-loaf-rainbow-james-rado-broadway-1792824065|title=Meat Loaf "RAINBOW" James Rado / Off-Broadway Musical 1972 Premiere Playbill {{!}} #1792824065|website=Worthpoint.com|access-date=August 8, 2019}}</ref>

===''More Than You Deserve''===
After the tour, Meat Loaf rejoined the cast of ''Hair'', this time on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]]. After he hired an agent, he auditioned for the [[Public Theater]]'s production of ''[[More Than You Deserve]]''. During the audition Meat Loaf met his future collaborator [[Jim Steinman]]. He sang a former Stoney and Meatloaf favorite of his, "(I'd Love to Be) As Heavy as Jesus", and subsequently got the part of Rabbit, a maniac that blows up his fellow soldiers so they can "go home." [[Ron Silver]] and [[Fred Gwynne]] were also in the show. In the summer between the show's workshop production (April 1973) and full production (Nov 1973 – Jan 1974), he appeared in a [[Shakespeare in the Park (New York City)|Shakespeare in the Park]] production of ''[[As You Like It]]'' with [[Raul Julia]] and [[Mary Beth Hurt]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/bf9f8856-a142-7a91-e040-e00a18062ca3|title=Meat Loaf and Raul Julia in the New York Shakespeare Festival stage production As You Like It|website=Digitalcollections.nypl.com|access-date=August 8, 2019}}</ref>

He recorded a single of "More Than You Deserve", with a [[cover version|cover]] of "[[Blind Faith (Blind Faith album)|Presence of the Lord]]" as the B-side. He was only able to save three copies of it because the record company did not allow its release.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} He recorded it again (1981) in a slightly rougher voice. The original single came out on RSO SO-407 with some promotional copies bearing both songs, while some were double-A side copies with "More Than You Deserve" in mono and stereo on them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/artist/meatloaf/us|title=Meatloaf Discography – USA |website=45cat.com}}</ref>

===''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'' (1974/75)===
{{Main|The Rocky Horror Show|The Rocky Horror Picture Show}}
In late 1973, Meat Loaf was cast in the original L.A. Roxy cast of ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'', playing the parts of Eddie and Dr. Everett Scott.<ref>[http://www.rockyhorror.com/history RHPS Official Fan Site &gt; History]. Retrieved December 3, 2009.</ref> Two other cast members from ''More Than You Deserve'' were also part of this cast; [[Graham Jarvis]] (playing The Narrator) and [[Kim Milford]] (playing Rocky).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jimsteinman.com/mtyd/newman1.html|title=More Than You Deserve – Newman theater program|website=Jimsteinman.com|access-date=August 8, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-The-Rocky-Horror-Show-Starring-Tim-Curry-And-The-Original-Roxy-Cast/master/76650|title=Various – The Rocky Horror Show (Starring Tim Curry And The Original Roxy Cast)|website=Discogs.com|access-date=August 8, 2019}}</ref> The success of the musical led to the filming of ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' in which Meat Loaf played only Eddie, a decision he said made the movie not as good as the musical.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFqmLvxORzQ#t=1m38s | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211028/VFqmLvxORzQ| archive-date=2021-10-28|title=Meat Loaf on the Rocky Horror Show – Part 1 |publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=November 13, 2007 |access-date=December 17, 2012}}{{cbignore}}</ref> About the same time, Meat Loaf and Steinman started work on ''[[Bat Out of Hell]]''. Meat Loaf convinced [[Epic Records]] to shoot [[music video|videos]] for four songs, "[[Bat Out of Hell (song)|Bat Out of Hell]]", "[[Paradise by the Dashboard Light]]", "[[You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth]]", and "[[Two Out of Three Ain't Bad]]". He then convinced [[Lou Adler]], the producer of ''Rocky Horror'', to run the "Paradise" video as a trailer to the movie. Meat Loaf's final theatrical show in New York was [[Gower Champion]]'s ''[[Rockabye Hamlet]]'', a [[Hamlet]] musical. It closed two weeks into its initial run. Meat Loaf later returned occasionally to perform "[[Hot Patootie – Bless My Soul]]" for a special ''Rocky Horror'' reunion or convention, and rarely at his own live shows (one performance of which was released in the 1996 ''[[Live Around the World (Meat Loaf album)|Live Around the World]]'' CD set).

During his recording of the soundtrack for ''Rocky Horror'', Meat Loaf recorded two more songs: "[[Stand by Me (Ben E. King song)|Stand by Me]]" (a [[Ben E. King]] cover), and "Clap Your Hands". They remained unreleased until 1984, when they appeared as B-sides to the "[[Nowhere Fast (Fire Inc. song)|Nowhere Fast]]" single.

In 1976, Meat Loaf recorded lead vocals for [[Ted Nugent]]'s album ''[[Free-for-All (Ted Nugent album)|Free-for-All]]'' when regular Nugent lead vocalist [[Derek St. Holmes]] temporarily quit the band. Meat Loaf sang lead on five of the album's nine tracks. As on the "Stoney & Meatloaf" album, he was credited as Meatloaf (one word) on the "Free-for-All" liner notes.

===''Bat Out of Hell'' (1977)===
Meat Loaf and Steinman started ''[[Bat Out of Hell]]'' in 1972, but did not get serious about it until the end of 1974. Meat Loaf decided to leave theater and concentrate exclusively on music. Then the [[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]] show ''[[Lemmings (National Lampoon)|Lemmings]]'' opened on Broadway and it needed an understudy for [[John Belushi]], a close friend of Meat Loaf since 1972. It was at the ''Lampoon'' show that Meat Loaf met [[Ellen Foley]], the co-star who sang "[[Paradise by the Dashboard Light]]" and "[[Bat Out of Hell (song)|Bat Out of Hell]]" with him on the album ''Bat Out of Hell''.

After the ''Lampoon'' show ended, Meat Loaf and Steinman spent time seeking a record deal. Their approaches were rejected by each record company, because their songs did not fit any specific recognized [[music industry]] style. Finally, they performed the songs for [[Todd Rundgren]], who decided to produce the album as well as play lead guitar on it (other members of Rundgren's band [[Utopia (American band)|Utopia]] also lent their musical talents).<ref>[http://trbazaar.com/rogerpowell.htm Roger Powell, keyboardist for Utopia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418072915/http://trbazaar.com/rogerpowell.htm |date=April 18, 2008 }}. Retrieved April 30, 2010.</ref> They then shopped the record around, but they still had no takers until [[Cleveland International Records]] decided to take a chance. In October 1977, ''Bat Out of Hell'' was finally released.
[[File:WMMS Meat Loaf concert - 1978 print ad.jpg|thumb|200px|A printed ad for a Meat Loaf concert in 1978]]
Meat Loaf and Steinman formed the band [[Neverland Express|The Neverland Express]] to tour in support of ''Bat Out of Hell''. Their first gig was opening for [[Cheap Trick]] in Chicago. He gained national exposure as the musical guest on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on March 25, 1978. Guest host [[Christopher Lee]] jokingly introduced him by saying, "And now ladies and gentlemen I would like you to meet Loaf. (pauses, looks dumbfounded) I beg your pardon, what? (he listens to the director's aside) Oh! Why...why I'm sorry, yes, of course...ah... Ladies and gentlemen, Meat Loaf!"

''Bat Out of Hell'' has sold an estimated 43 million copies globally (15&nbsp;million of those in the United States),<ref name="Steinman"/> making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. In the United Kingdom alone, its 2.1&nbsp;million sales put it in 38th place. Despite peaking at No. 9 and spending only two weeks in the top ten in 1981, it has now spent 485 weeks on the [[UK Albums Chart]] (May 2015), a figure bettered only by ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'' by [[Fleetwood Mac]] with 487 weeks.<ref>{{cite news|title=Meat Loaf: In and Out of Hell|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04xdrrb|agency=BBC|date=July 15, 2015}}</ref> In Australia, it knocked the [[Bee Gees]] off the No. 1 spot and became the biggest-selling album of all time in that country. ''Bat Out of Hell'' has, as of December 2020, spent a total of 522 weeks in the Top 200 in the UK chart;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/bat-out-of-hell/ |title=Bat Out of Hell – Meat Loaf|publisher=Official Charts |access-date=April 19, 2014}}</ref> this makes it the longest stay in any music chart in the world, although the ''published'' chart contains just 100 positions.

===''Bad for Good'' and ''Dead Ringer'' (1981)===
In 1976, Meat Loaf appeared in the short-lived Broadway production of the rock musical ''[[Rockabye Hamlet]]''.

Steinman started to work on ''[[Bad for Good]]'', the album that was supposed to be the follow-up to 1977's ''Bat Out of Hell'', in 1979. During that time, a combination of touring, drugs and exhaustion had caused Meat Loaf to lose his voice. Without a singer, and pressured by the record company, Steinman decided that he should sing on ''Bad for Good'' himself, and write a new album for Meat Loaf; the result was ''[[Dead Ringer (album)|Dead Ringer]]'', which was later released in 1981, after the release of Steinman's ''Bad for Good''.

After playing the role of Travis Redfish in the movie ''[[Roadie (1980 film)|Roadie]]'', Meat Loaf's singing voice returned, and he started to work on his new album in 1980. Steinman had written five new songs which, in addition to the track "More Than You Deserve" (sung by Meat Loaf in the stage musical of the same name) and a reworked monologue, formed the album ''Dead Ringer'', which was produced by Meat Loaf and Stephan Galfas, with backing tracks produced by [[Todd Rundgren]], Jimmy Iovine, and Steinman. (In 1976, Meat Loaf appeared on the track "Keeper Keep Us", from the [[Intergalactic Touring Band]]'s self-titled album, produced by Galfas.) The song "[[Dead Ringer for Love]]" was the pinnacle of the album, and launched Meat Loaf to even greater success after it reached No. 5 in the United Kingdom and stayed in the UK Singles Chart for 19 weeks. [[Cher]] provided the lead female vocals in the song.

A comedy/documentary movie was filmed to accompany the release of ''Dead Ringer'', written and produced by Meat Loaf's managers [[David Sonenberg]] and [[Al Dellentash]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101673/?ref_=nm_flmg_wr_1 |title=Dead Ringer for Love |date=August 27, 1982 |website=IMDb.com }}</ref> It featured Meat Loaf playing two roles: himself and a Meat Loaf fan, 'Marvin'. Sonenberg persuaded [[CBS]] to advance money for the making of the movie, which was shown at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] and won some favorable reviews.

The album reached No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart, and three singles were released from the album: "Dead Ringer for Love" (with [[Cher]]), "I'm Gonna Love Her for Both of Us", and "Read 'Em and Weep".

===''Midnight at the Lost and Found'' (1983)===
Following a dispute with his former songwriter Jim Steinman, Meat Loaf was contractually obliged to release a new album. Struggling for time, and with, it seemed, no resolution to his arguments with Steinman on the horizon (eventually they sued each other), he was forced to find songwriters wherever he could. The resulting album was ''[[Midnight at the Lost and Found]]''.

According to Meat Loaf, Steinman had given the songs "[[Total Eclipse of the Heart]]" and "[[Making Love Out of Nothing at All]]" to Meat Loaf for this album. However, Meat Loaf's record company refused to pay for Steinman.<ref>{{cite news|first=Cameron|last=Adams|title=Meat Loaf's a Hell raiser|work=Herald Sun|url= http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/music/meat-loafs-a-hell-raiser/story-e6frf9hf-1111112415532|date=October 26, 2006|access-date=April 30, 2010}}</ref> [[Bonnie Tyler]]'s version of "Eclipse" and [[Air Supply]]'s version of "Making Love" topped the charts together, holding No. 1 and No. 2 for a period during 1983.

Meat Loaf is credited with having been involved in the writing of some of the tracks on the album, including the title track, "Midnight at the Lost and Found".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Giles |first1=Jeff |title=How Meat Loaf Crashed on 'Midnight at the Lost and Found'|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/meat-loaf-midnight-at-the-lost-and-found/ |website=ultimateclassicrock.com |access-date=February 4, 2020}}</ref>

The title track still regularly forms part of Meat Loaf concerts, and was one of few 1980s songs to feature on the 1998 hit album ''[[The Very Best of Meat Loaf]]''. This was Meat Loaf's final album to be released through [[Epic Records|Epic]]. It was also his last album release via [[Sony Music]] until 2011's ''[[Hell in a Handbasket]]''.

On December 5, 1981, Meat Loaf and the Neverland Express were the musical guests for ''Saturday Night Live'' where he and former fellow ''Rocky Horror Picture Show'' actor [[Tim Curry]] performed a skit depicting a One-Stop Rocky Horror Shop.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/49706/rocky-horror-facts/|title=Rocky Horror Turns 40: Time Warp to 40 Facts About the Cult Classic|last=McPadden August 15, 2015|first=Mike|website=Vh1.com|access-date=January 25, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/season-7/episode/7-tim-curry-with-meat-loaf-65051|title=SNL Season 07 Episode 07 – Tim Curry, Meat Loaf |website=Nbc.com|access-date=January 25, 2019}}</ref> Later, Curry performed "The Zucchini Song" and Meat Loaf & the Neverland Express performed "Bat Out of Hell" and "Promised Land".

===Arista Records and ''Bad Attitude'' (1984)===
In 1984, Meat Loaf went to England to record the album ''[[Bad Attitude (album)|Bad Attitude]]''; it was released that year. It features two songs by Steinman, both previously recorded. It was a minor success with a few commercially successful singles, the most successful being "[[Modern Girl (Meat Loaf song)|Modern Girl]]". The American release on RCA Records was in April 1985 and features a slightly different track list, as well as alternate mixes for some songs. The title track features a duet with [[the Who]]'s lead singer [[Roger Daltrey]].

"Modern Girl" was the first single taken from the album but was only a moderate success on the European Charts.

In 1986 he and songwriter [[John Parr]] started recording a new album, ''[[Blind Before I Stop]]''. In 1985, Meat Loaf took part in some comedy sketches in the UK, with [[Hugh Laurie]]. Meat Loaf also tried stand-up comedy, appearing several times in Connecticut.<ref name=sagoml/>

===''Blind Before I Stop'' (1986)===
''[[Blind Before I Stop]]'' was released in 1986. It features production, mixing, and general influence by [[Frank Farian]]. Meat Loaf gave songwriting another shot with this album and wrote three of the songs on the album. Released as a single (in the United Kingdom) was "Rock 'n' Roll Mercenaries", which was a duet with rock singer [[John Parr]]. Another single released in the United Kingdom was "Special Girl".

According to Meat Loaf's 1998 autobiography, the album sold poorly because of its production.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Meat Loaf would have preferred to cancel the project and wait to work with more Steinman material.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} However, the album gained a cult following over the years, with the songs "Execution Day" and "Standing on the Outside" as standout tracks on the record.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} "Standing on the Outside" was also featured during the third season of the 1980s television series ''[[Miami Vice]]'';<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0647064/soundtrack|title=Miami Vice, Forgive Us Our Debts, Soundtrack (1986)|website=IMDb.com|access-date=June 3, 2019}}</ref> it was used several times during the episode titled "Forgive Us Our Debts" (first aired December 12, 1986).

In the former [[Soviet Union|USSR]], this was the first Meat Loaf album officially permitted to be published, in connection with the beginning of the collapse of the [[Iron Curtain]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The song "Masculine" was the only song from the record that was a live show mainstay from 1987 to 1992.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} He then omitted that song in favor of "[[Life Is a Lemon and I Want My Money Back]]", following the success of ''Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell''.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Meat Loaf performed "Thrashin" for the soundtrack of the 1986 skateboarding film ''[[Thrashin' (film)|Thrashin']]'' (directed by [[David Winters (choreographer)|David Winters]] and starring [[Josh Brolin]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092085/soundtrack|title=Soundtracks for Thrashin' (1986)|website=IMDb.com|access-date=December 17, 2012}}</ref>

===Virgin Records and ''Bat Out of Hell II'' (1993)===
Following the success of Meat Loaf's touring in the 1980s, he and Steinman began work during the Christmas of 1990 on the sequel to ''Bat Out of Hell''. After two years, ''[[Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell]]'' was finished. The artist's then manager, Tommy Manzi, later told [[HitQuarters]] that music industry insiders were wholly unenthusiastic about the idea of a comeback, and considered the project "a joke".<ref name="hitquarters">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_TManzi.html |title=Interview With Tommy Manzi |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=May 7, 2001 |access-date=May 6, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609212527/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_TManzi.html |archive-date=June 9, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The immediate success of ''Bat Out of Hell II'' saw the album going on to sell over 15 million copies, and the single "[[I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)]]" reaching number one in 28 countries. Meat Loaf won the [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Solo]] in 1994 for "I'd Do Anything for Love".<ref>{{cite web |title=GRAMMY AWARDS: BEST ROCK VOCAL SOLO PERFORMANCE|work=Rock on the Net |url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/grammy/rocksolo.htm |access-date=November 26, 2006}}</ref> This song stayed at No. 1 in the UK chart for seven consecutive weeks.

In Germany, Meat Loaf was commercially successful following the release of ''Bat Out of Hell II''.

Also in 1994, he sang the U.S. national anthem "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" at the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vHwPmKmwH4| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211028/_vHwPmKmwH4| archive-date=2021-10-28|title=meat loaf star spangled banner 1994 – Yahoo Video Search Results|website=Video.search.yahoo.com|access-date=January 26, 2018}}{{cbignore}}</ref> He released the single "[[Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through]]", which reached No. 13 in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1994-03-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170617213613/https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1994-03-12|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 17, 2017|title=Music: Top 100 Songs {{!}} Billboard Hot 100 Chart {{!}} Billboard|date=June 17, 2017|access-date=January 30, 2018}}</ref>

===''Welcome to the Neighborhood'' (1995)===
In 1995, Meat Loaf released his seventh studio album, ''[[Welcome to the Neighbourhood (Meat Loaf album)|Welcome to the Neighborhood]]''.

Of the twelve songs on the album, two are written by Steinman. Both are cover versions, the "Original Sin" from [[Pandora's Box (band)|Pandora's Box]]'s ''Original Sin'' album and "Left in the Dark" first appeared on Steinman's own ''Bad for Good'' as well as the 1984 album ''[[Emotion (Barbra Streisand album)|Emotion]]'' by [[Barbra Streisand]]. The video had a bigger budget than any of his previous videos.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} His other singles, "I'd Lie for You (And That's the Truth)" and "Not a Dry Eye in the House", were written by [[Diane Warren]].

===''Is Nothing Sacred?'' and ''The Very Best of Meat Loaf'' (1998)===
In 1998, Meat Loaf released ''[[The Very Best of Meat Loaf]]''. Although not reaching the top ten in the United Kingdom, it went platinum in December of that year,<ref>{{cite web|last=Hawtin|first=Steve|title=Album artist 127 – Meatloaf|url=http://tsort.info/music/55erum.htm|work=TsorT|access-date=September 3, 2013}}</ref> and was already platinum around the rest of the world just after its release. The album featured all of Meat Loaf's best-known songs, a few from his less popular albums from the 1980s, and three new songs co-written by Steinman – two with [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and one with [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]], "[[Is Nothing Sacred]]", released as a single. The single version of this song is a duet with Patti Russo, whereas the album version is a solo song by Meat Loaf. The album did not feature any songs from his 1986 album ''Blind Before I Stop''.

===''Couldn't Have Said It Better'' (2003)===
In 2003, Meat Loaf released his album ''[[Couldn't Have Said It Better]]''. Only for the third time in his career, Meat Loaf released an album without any songs written by Steinman (not counting live bonus tracks on special edition releases). Although Meat Loaf claimed that ''Couldn't Have Said It Better'' was "the most perfect album [he] did since ''Bat Out of Hell''",<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wall |first1=Mick |title=Like a Bat Out of Hell: The Larger than Life Story of Meat Loaf |date=2017 |publisher=Orion Publishing Group}}</ref> it was not as commercially successful. The album was a minor commercial success worldwide and reached No. 4 in the UK Albums Chart,<ref name="auto1"/> accompanied by a sellout world tour to promote the album and some of Meat Loaf's best selling singles. One such performance on his world tour was at Sydney's [[2003 NRL grand final]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Alex Brown, Malcolm Brown and Jacqueline Maley|title=Fairytale of the year: Panthers pluck Roosters|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/10/05/1065292479504.html|access-date=August 27, 2011|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=October 6, 2003}}</ref> There were many writers for the album including [[Diane Warren]] and James Michael, who were both asked to contribute his 2006 album, ''[[Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose]]''. James Michael had never written for Meat Loaf before, and it was only his songs that were released as singles from the album.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The album featured duets with Patti Russo and Meat Loaf's daughter [[Pearl Aday]]. Upon the album's release, Meat Loaf told [[Paul Stenning]], "The more you discover it the better the record gets for you. I think we did that the correct way, everyone involved. I can sense that from how the record is sustaining itself without a lot of airplay."<ref>''Powerplay Magazine'', July 2003</ref>

===Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (2004)===
[[File:Meat Loaf in performance (New York, 2004).jpg|thumb|Meat Loaf performing in New York in 2004]]
From February 20 to 22, 2004, during an Australian tour, Meat Loaf performed with the [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]], titled ''[[Bat Out of Hell: Live with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]]''. The performance included the [[Australian Boys' Choir]] singing back-up on a ''Couldn't Have Said It Better'' track, "Testify". The show was released as a DVD and a CD called ''Meat Loaf and The Neverland Express featuring Patti Russo Live with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Meat Loaf: Live with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (2004) |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0437327/ |website=IMDb.com |date=October 18, 2004 |access-date=February 4, 2020}}</ref> The CD had few edited songs from the concert on it.

On November 17, 2003, during a performance at London's [[Wembley Arena]], on his ''Couldn't Have Said It Better'' tour, he collapsed of what was later diagnosed as [[Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome]]. The following week, he underwent a surgical procedure intended to correct the problem.<ref>{{cite news |title=Meat Loaf recalls stage collapse|work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3247268.stm |date=November 28, 2003 |access-date=April 2, 2007}}</ref> As a result, Meat Loaf's insurance agency did not allow him to perform for any longer than one hour and 45 minutes.

As well as singing his best-known songs, Meat Loaf sang a cover version of the hit single "[[Black Betty]]". During this tour he also sang "Only When I Feel", a song meant to appear on his then-upcoming album ''Bat Out of Hell III''. The song subsequently turned into "If It Ain't Broke (Break It)".

In the weeks following the release of ''Bat III'', Meat Loaf and the NLE (the [[Neverland Express]]) did a brief tour of America and Europe, known as the Bases Loaded Tour. In 2007, a newer, bigger worldwide tour began, [[The Seize the Night Tour]], with Marion Raven, serving as a supporting act, throughout the European and American tour. Portions of the tour in February 2007 were featured in the documentary ''[[Meat Loaf: In Search of Paradise]]'', directed by [[Bruce David Klein]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Meat Loaf: In Search of Paradise (2007) |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1034080/ |website=imdb.com |date=July 18, 2008 |access-date=February 4, 2020}}</ref> The film was an official selection of the [[Montreal World Film Festival]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Miller |first1=Doug |title=Meat Loaf has found the way to 'Paradise' |url=https://www.today.com/popculture/meat-loaf-has-found-way-paradise-wbna24002285 |website=today.com |publisher=NBC Universal |access-date=February 4, 2020}}</ref> It opened in theaters in March 2008 and was released on DVD in May 2008.

During a performance at the [[Metro Radio Arena]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], England, on October 31, 2007, at the opening of "Paradise by the Dashboard Light" he suggested that the crowd of thousands should enjoy the performance as it was the last of his career. He attempted to sing the first line of the song, but instead said "Ladies and gentlemen, I love you, thank you for coming, but I can no longer continue." Removing the jacket he was wearing, he thanked the audience for 30 years, said "goodbye forever" and left the stage. His tour promoter, Andrew Miller, denied that this was the end for Meat Loaf and said he would continue touring after suitable rest.<ref>{{cite news |title='Stressed' Meat Loaf abandons gig |date=November 1, 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7072828.stm |work=BBC.co.uk |access-date=November 1, 2007}}</ref> The next two gigs in the tour, at the [[National Exhibition Centre|NEC]] and [[Manchester Evening News Arena]] were cancelled because of "acute [[laryngitis]]" and were rescheduled for late November.<ref>{{cite news |title=Meat Loaf calls off another show |date=November 4, 2007 |work=BBC.co.uk |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7077734.stm |access-date=November 5, 2007}}</ref> The concert scheduled for November 6, 2007, at London's [[Wembley Arena]] was also cancelled.

===''Hang Cool Teddy Bear'' (2009)===
In May 2009, Meat Loaf began work on the album ''[[Hang Cool Teddy Bear]]'' in the studio with [[Green Day]]'s ''[[American Idiot]]'' album producer [[Rob Cavallo]], working with such writers as [[Justin Hawkins]], Rick Brantley, Ollie Wride, Tommy Henriksen and [[Jon Bon Jovi]].<ref name="vidtweet">{{cite web|url=http://www.vidtweeter.com/show.php?id%3D9jcbn |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 1, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006124200/http://www.vidtweeter.com/show.php?id=9jcbn |archive-date=October 6, 2014 }}</ref> Though not much was revealed officially to begin with, Meat Loaf gave away some information through videos he posted on Twitter and YouTube. The album is based on the story of a fictional soldier, whose "story" furnishes the theme. During his concert of March 19, 2011, held outside of Vancouver, B.C., Canada, Meat Loaf explained that he had wanted an insert put with the album to explain what the premise of the album was, but he said there were too many "bleeping" record label politics and it did not get done. He went on to tell the audience that the story was of a soldier who, being wounded, had his life flash forward before his eyes, and the songs were telling the story of his life.

The album is based on a short story by the Los Angeles-based screenwriter and director Kilian Kerwin, a long-time friend of the singer. [[Hugh Laurie]] and [[Jack Black]] both perform on the album, Laurie plays piano on the song "If I Can't Have You", while Black sings a duet with Meat Loaf on "Like A Rose". Patti Russo and Kara DioGuardi also duet on the album. Queen's [[Brian May]] features on guitar along with [[Steve Vai]].
