==Biography==

===Early years===
Wickham was raised in a Christian home, the second of three children (brother [[Evan Wickham|Evan]], sister Jillian), and began leading worship for his youth group at 13 years old. In 2002, he graduated from Calvary Christian School in Vista, California. Wickham's father is currently a worship leader, and both of his parents were at one time members of Jesus movement band Parable. His older brother, Evan Wickham, is also a musician, who used to serve at Calvary Chapel in Vista and later became pastor of Park Hill Church in San Diego, California.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ajesuschurch.org/park-hill/|title=Park Hill — A Jesus Church Network}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newreleasetoday.com/artistdetail.php?artist_id=1013|title=Evan Wickham Artist Profile {{!}} Biography And Discography {{!}} NewReleaseToday|website=www.newreleasetoday.com|access-date=2018-11-17}}</ref> His parents, John and Lisa (née Irwin), encouraged Wickham to learn popular praise songs and to write his own. Wickham began his full-time music career by touring California and recording his first album.

==Personal life==
Wickham had surgery to remove a polyp from folds of his vocal cords on April 28, 2014, after which he was prescribed a month of silence to allow the surgical site to heal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philwickham.com/blog/2016/5/2/i-had-surgery|title=I HAD SURGERY|last=Wickham|first=Phil|date=May 18, 2014|website=PhilWickham.com|access-date=November 13, 2016}}</ref> He was uncertain that he would be able to sing again, leading to identity issues and self-doubt. His spiritual revelation during these times was the basis for his 2016 album ''Children of God''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.azcentral.com/amp/80563710|title=azcentral.com - Home}}</ref>
