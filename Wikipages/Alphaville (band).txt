==History==
===Formation===
Alphaville was formed after lead singer [[Marian Gold]] and [[Bernhard Lloyd]] met in Berlin in 1981. The pair were heavily influenced by UK indie acts like [[Tubeway Army]], [[Gary Numan]] and [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]] (OMD). Gold had written "Big in Japan" in 1979 after hearing the music of [[Holly Johnson]]'s band [[Big in Japan (band)|Big in Japan]].<ref name="gfp">{{cite web|url=https://www.classicpopmag.com/2019/09/godfathers-of-pop-marian-gold/|title=Godfathers of Pop: Marian Gold|last=McPherson|first=Douglas|date=September 2019|website=[[Classic Pop (magazine)|Classic Pop]]|access-date=5 May 2021}}</ref> They first named their band "Forever Young" and subsequently changed it to "Alphaville" after the [[Alphaville (film)|1965 science fiction film]].{{CN|date=June 2021}} Together the three wrote ''Forever Young'' and recorded their first demo of the same name. In 1984, the newly renamed Alphaville released their debut single, "Big in Japan". In the early years, Gold said that "none of us could really play an instrument. The music was in our heads, but we were dependent on synthesizers and drum machines and things like that. ... The equipment we had at that time was basically toys – the cheapest monophonic synthesizers you could imagine. We had a little studio in a basement, made a couple of demos and sent them to some record companies to try to get a deal. We didn’t have much hope, but we had three offers and from that moment everything happened very fast."<ref name="gfp" />

===''Forever Young'' (1984)===
{{Main article|Forever Young (Alphaville album)}}
In autumn 1984, they released their debut album, ''Forever Young'', produced by Colin Pearson, Wolfgang Loos and Andreas Budde.

"Big in Japan" topped the charts in Germany, Greece, Switzerland, Sweden, Turkey, Venezuela, and the US [[Billboard charts|Billboard Dance Chart]] (the group's only Top 10 on any Billboard chart). The single also reached the Top Five in the Netherlands, Norway, Austria, Ireland and South Africa. It became the group's only Top 20 single in the UK, peaking at No.&nbsp;8.

The band's next two singles, "[[Sounds Like a Melody]]" and "[[Forever Young (Alphaville song)|Forever Young]]", were also both European Top 5 successes, although the former track failed to make an impression on the American charts.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} The song "Forever Young" was written during the [[Cold War]], where the singer said "hoping for the best, but expecting the worst; are you gonna drop the bomb or not?"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://validate.perfdrive.com/cd6bfa9f9cdd2a071aa114a9470966c5/captcha?ssa=6db0a098-d5de-4368-8a38-0e47589b1738&ssb=1ahkfz3cg5k6hebi5fkc3mb1f&ssc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.songfacts.com%2Ffacts%2Falphaville%2Fforever-young&ssd=932613013340932&sse=ebajoenaipmoceh&ssf=49b411d979113cc8d5f79f967e72aeebab6db901&ssg=45dbb283-5e6e-495c-6fb8-528db02dfa09&ssh=73565833-0036-495c-6fb9-2c55ea42adc3&ssi=d367b71e-89ae-495c-64c1-bab1f39a5500&ssj=49f68b18-662e-495c-6fb9-c0258cce5492&ssk=support@shieldsquare.com&ssl=408628761537&ssm=54532403464245570104013861335565&ssn=45cb59fa49a4121a3521b9e4e90ff3ba38ba5f5f495c601831.87301cd8a4&sso=e148f049112e5b8de233aef10aa1252863871268373c&ssp=29448677211600077989160007997502175&ssq=04351218022079007592680220170566891461578&ssr=MjA4LjgwLjE1My42MQ==&sss=Mozilla/5.0%20(compatible;%20Googlebot/2.1;%20+http://www.google.com/bot.html)&sst=ZoteroTranslationServer/WMF%20(mailto:services@lists.wikimedia.org)&ssu=Mozilla/4.0%20(compatible;%20MSIE%208.0;%20Windows%20NT%206.1)%20Gecko/20100101%20Firefox/39.0&ssv=9lqsuo1trp9m2r2&ssw=&ssx=554147210006166&ssy=cpaffbopmmajaeehiji@lkcdfkdenfkik@gpnhee&ssz=6dacbbdbc112e3c&3d0be5101edbc0bd3c6a5b9bbc4fd5152cbe8977|title=ShieldSquare Captcha|website=Validate.perfdrive.com|access-date=14 September 2020}}</ref>

Amid reports that pop star [[Laura Branigan]] was featuring the song on her next album, ''[[Hold Me (Laura Branigan album)|Hold Me]]'', Alphaville's "Forever Young" was re-released as a single in the US.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The Alphaville version was released a third time in the US in 1988, to promote ''Alphaville: The Singles Collection'', and peaked at No.&nbsp;65, their highest charting (and also last) single on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Despite the success of the album and its singles, the band did not tour. Said Gold, "we didn't feel we were good enough musicians [to tour]. These days it wouldn't be a problem to go out and play with tracks, but at that time it was really complicated. We didn't feel like we were performers. We felt more like we were studio rats. The studio felt like a safe environment. So, much to the annoyance of our manager, we didn't play [live] very much."<ref name="gfp" />

Soon after the success of the album, Mertens left the band in December. He was replaced in January 1985 by Marian's old friend [[Ricky Echolette]] on keyboard and guitar.

==Legacy==
{{unsourced|section|date=April 2020}}
Alphaville's song "[[Forever Young (Alphaville song)|Forever Young]]" was featured in the movie ''[[Listen to Me (film)|Listen to Me]]'' (1989) featuring [[Kirk Cameron]] in one of his first film roles. "Forever Young" was played in a high school prom-related scene in the 2004 film ''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]''. "Forever Young" was also featured in the Canadian movie ''[[1987 (film)|1987]]'' (2014).

Swedish melodic metal band [[Embraced]] did a cover of "[[Big in Japan (Alphaville song)|Big in Japan]]" on their 1998 Album ''[[Amorous Anathema]]''. In 2000, [[Guano Apes]] covered "Big in Japan" in their second full-length album, ''[[Don't Give Me Names]]''. In 2008, "Big in Japan" was featured in the commercial for the Swedish TV show ''Stor i Japan'' (Translated: ''Big in Japan'') and was also used several times within the show, using different cover versions as the opening theme. [[VH1 Classic]]'s show ''[[VH1 Classic 120 Minutes|120 Minutes]]'' often features the song.

In the first part of 2006, Australian guitar band [[Youth Group]] took their remake of "Forever Young" to No.&nbsp;1 in the Official Australian Charts, thanks in part to exposure the track had received from being on popular US TV series ''[[The O.C.]]'' and its fifth TV soundtrack CD, ''[[Music from the OC: Mix 5]]''.

"Young Forever" is the fourth single by American hip hop rapper Jay-Z from his album ''The Blueprint 3'' on the Roc Nation label. The song was produced by rapper Kanye West. It is a mild rework of Alphaville's 1984 song "Forever Young": the original melody is retained, [[Mr Hudson]] sings the original lyrics (primarily during the chorus), and Jay-Z raps in place of the verses.
