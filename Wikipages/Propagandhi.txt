'''Propagandhi''' is a Canadian [[punk rock]] band formed in [[Portage la Prairie]], [[Manitoba]] in 1986 by guitarist Chris Hannah and drummer Jord Samolesky. The band is currently located in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]<ref>[https://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/article/a-comprehensive-look-at-winnipegs-rock-history-part-2 "A Comprehensive Look At Winnipeg’s PC Punk Scene"]. ''Noisey'', Sheldon Birnie Sep 22 2014,</ref> and completed by bassist [[Todd Kowalski]] and guitarist [[Sulynn Hago]].

While their earlier work was aligned with the [[punk rock]] and [[skate punk]] tradition, in later years Propagandhi records have moved towards a heavier and more technical [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]-influenced sound.<ref name="news.bostonherald"/><ref name="phoenixnewtimes"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/bands/propagandhi |title=About Propagandhi |publisher=Punknews.org |access-date=2011-03-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Heslam |first=Jessica |url=http://news.bostonherald.com/entertainment/music/general/view/2009_03_16_Disseminating_political_Propagandhi/srvc=home&position=recent |title=Disseminating political Propagandhi - BostonHerald.com |publisher=News.bostonherald.com |date=2009-03-17 |access-date=2011-03-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613044436/http://news.bostonherald.com/entertainment/music/general/view/2009_03_16_Disseminating_political_Propagandhi/srvc%3Dhome%26position%3Drecent |archive-date=2011-06-13 }}</ref>  Both in their lyrics and hands-on activism, the band's members champion various [[left wing]] and [[anarchist]] causes and [[veganism]], and have taken a vocal stance against [[human rights]] violations, [[sexism]], [[racism]], [[nationalism]], [[homophobia]], [[imperialism]], [[capitalism]] and organized [[religion]].<ref>[http://vegetarianstar.com/tag/propagandhi Propagandhi Likes Vegan Thai Food On The Road], ''Vegetarian Star'', April 1st 2009.</ref><ref>[http://www.chartattack.com/news/29512/propagandhi-randy-bring-the-message-to-western-canada Propagandhi & Randy Bring The Message To Western Canada], ''Chart Attack'', August 10th 2001.</ref>

==History==
===Formation, first two records (1986–1997)===
In 1986, Samolesky and Hannah recruited original bassist Scott Hopper via a "progressive thrash band looking for bass player" flyer posted in a local record shop.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://propagandhi.com/about/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124123857/http://www.propagandhi.com/about/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2005-11-24 |title=Propagandhi … About |publisher=Propagandhi.com |date=2010-12-26 |access-date=2011-03-10 }}</ref> Hopper was replaced three years later by Mike Braumeister, which completed the first lineup to perform live.  After the band established itself through several demos and larger shows, including one with [[Fugazi]], Braumeister moved to [[Vancouver]], and [[John K. Samson]] became the band's third bassist.

In 1992, Propagandhi played a show with [[California]] punk rock band [[NOFX]] and included in their set a cover version of [[Cheap Trick]]'s "[[I Want You to Want Me]]". Impressed by their performance, NOFX front man [[Fat Mike]] signed them to his independent record label [[Fat Wreck Chords]]. The band later accompanied him to [[Los Angeles]], where they recorded their debut album, ''[[How to Clean Everything]]'', released in 1993. The band spent the next three years touring and issuing several smaller releases, including the ''[[How to Clean a Couple o' Things]]'' single on Fat Wreck Chords, a [[I'd Rather Be Flag-Burning|split 10" record]] with [[I Spy (band)|I Spy]], a [[Propagandhi/FYP|split 7"]] with [[F.Y.P]], and the double 7" ''[[Where Quality is Job Number 1|Where Quality is Job No.&nbsp;1]]'', the latter three on [[Recess Records]].

In 1996, they recorded and released their second album, ''[[Less Talk, More Rock]]'', via Fat Wreck Chords. The title was ironic, as they had become well known for lengthy song explanations and speeches during live performances. The album was more politicized than its predecessor, with such song titles as "Apparently, I'm a 'P.C. Fascist' (Because I Care About Both Human and Non-Human Animals)", "Nailing [[Descartes]] to the Wall/(Liquid) Meat Is ''Still'' Murder", and "... And We Thought Nation-States Were a Bad Idea". [[Ramsey Kanaan]], founder of the anarchist publishing company [[AK Press]], appears on "A Public Dis-Service Announcement from [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]]" as the voice of the petroleum multinational. Partial proceeds of the album were donated to AK and other activist groups. ''Less Talk, More Rock'' caused some controversy at the time of its release due to the band's pro [[feminism]] and "gay positive" stance which, according to Hannah, clashed with the sexist and homophobic culture of the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] punk rock scene with which the band had become associated.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfNLY_sR1xs |title=According to Propagandhi: How the punk scene, politics and activism have evolved over the years |publisher=q on cbc|date=2017-11-07 |access-date=2018-03-30}}</ref>

===''Today's Empires, Tomorrow's Ashes'' (1997–2005)===
After ''Less Talk, More Rock''{{'}}s release, Samson departed and formed [[The Weakerthans]]. Hannah's then-roommate [[Todd Kowalski]], formerly of Propagandhi's touring mates I Spy and the political [[grindcore]] band [[Swallowing Shit]], replaced him. Hannah and Samolesky also founded the record label [[G7 Welcoming Committee Records]], which also released The Weakerthans' first album.  The label structured itself around the [[participatory economics|participatory economic]] proposals of [[Robin Hahnel]] and [[Michael Albert]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/review/420 |title=review of Swallowing Shit album |publisher=Punknews |access-date=2011-03-10}}</ref> The band issued ''[[Where Quantity Is Job Number 1|Where Quantity Is Job No.&nbsp;1]]'', a collection of EP and compilation tracks, demos, and live songs.

In 2001, Propagandhi released their third album, ''[[Today's Empires, Tomorrow's Ashes]]''. The album was considered by some<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juicycerebellum.com/freestuff05prop.htm |title=Review of ''Today's Empires, Tomorrow's Ashes'' with comments by bassist Todd Kowalski|access-date=September 29, 2012}}</ref> to be a major departure from their previous works. The song titles and lyrics of ''Today's Empires, Tomorrow's Ashes'' furthered the sphere of their political views, bolstered by the addition of Kowalski's aggressive songwriting and an increased density of guitar lines. The album includes enhanced content, with political videos and essays concerning such topics as [[COINTELPRO]] and the [[Black Panther Party]].

===''Potemkin City Limits'', expansion to four-piece (2005–2008)===
[[Image:Chris Hannah.jpg|thumb|Chris Hannah performing at [[Galpón Víctor Jara]] in Santiago-Chile, 2007]]
Propagandhi released the album ''[[Potemkin City Limits]]'' on October 18, 2005. Like its predecessor, the album features multimedia content, with a number of [[PDF]] files on topics such as participatory economics and veganism, and links to websites of organizations that Propagandhi support. The album's opening track, "A Speculative Fiction", won the 2006 [[SOCAN Songwriting Prize]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.socansongwritingprize.ca/past-nominees-and-winners/|title=Past Nominees and Winners|website=Socansongwritingprize.ca}}</ref><ref name=globe>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/propagandhi-machine/article1155603/ "Propagandhi machine"]. Robert Everett-Green, ''Globe and Mail'', Mar. 19, 2009</ref> by online vote.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.echoprize.ca/echoen/history.jsp |title=ECHO Songwriting Prize: Past Nominees & Winners |publisher=echoprize.ca |access-date=2012-09-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017064524/http://www.echoprize.ca/echoen/history.jsp |archive-date=2012-10-17 }}</ref> Propagandhi pledged to use the $5000 prize to make donations to the [[Haiti]] Action Network and The Welcome Place, an organization in Winnipeg for which they'd previously done volunteer work which helps refugees start new lives in Manitoba.

Hannah briefly adopted the pseudonym Glen Lambert in the run-up to and immediate aftermath of the release of ''Potemkin City Limits'', causing confusion among some fans, reviewers, and commentators;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skratchmagazine.com/interviews/interviews.php?id=145 |title=de beste bron van informatie over webarchiv |publisher=skratchmagazine.com |access-date=2011-03-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128113517/http://skratchmagazine.com/interviews/interviews.php?id=145 |archive-date=2010-11-28 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uppingtheanti.org/node/1574|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605071408/http://uppingtheanti.org/node/1574|url-status=dead|title=''Upping the Ante''|archive-date=June 5, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Sutherland |first=Sam |url=http://exclaim.ca/articles/points.aspx?csid1=75 |title=Propagandhi Aren't Sexy |publisher=Exclaim.ca |access-date=2011-03-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626131247/http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/points.aspx?csid1=75 |archive-date=2007-06-26 }}</ref> the band concluded the prank by announcing on 14 August 2006 that Glen Lambert had been dismissed and would be replaced by "former" member Chris Hannah.  This coincided with the addition of second guitarist [[David Guillas]], marking the band's first four-piece lineup in their then-twenty year career. Guillas, nicknamed "The Beaver", was a former member of two Winnipeg-based rock outfits, [[Giant Sons]] and Rough Music. Hannah had previously stated that he had been a fan of, and influenced by, Guillas' work in Giant Sons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/14768 |title=Propagandhi |publisher=Punknews.org |access-date=2011-03-10}}</ref>

In 2007, the band released a [[DVD]] entitled ''Live from Occupied Territory'', which features a recording of their set at The Zoo in Winnipeg on July 19, 2003. Proceeds of the DVD benefit the [[Asubpeeschoseewagong First Nation|Grassy Narrows]] blockade and the Middle East Children's Alliance. Included on the DVD are two full-length documentaries: ''Peace, Propaganda and the Promised Land'', and ''As Long as the Rivers Flow''.

===''Supporting Caste'', ''Failed States'' (2008–2015)===
The band spent the following years working on their fifth record, ''[[Supporting Caste]]''.<ref name=globe />  During the recording sessions, Hannah stated that to his ears the record "resemble[d] a nuclear-powered space-age composite of ''Potemkin City Limits'', ''Less Talk More Rock'', Giant Son's ''Anthology'' and a carefully measured dose of ''Today's Empires Tomorrow's Ashes''".  The band created a web page giving fans an option to receive two high-quality songs from the album before its release by donating $1 to $10 to one of three activist organizations which they supported. The page also linked to various pre-orders of the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://propagandhi.com/supporting-caste/index.php |title=''Supporting Caste'' :: Pre-order ended |publisher=Propagandhi |access-date=2011-03-10}}</ref> It was officially released on 10 March 2009.

The digital ''[[The Recovered EP|Recovered EP]]'' followed on 6 April 2010.  It featured old recordings from the ''How To Clean Everything'' and ''Less Talk, More Rock'' eras, remastered and with new parts recorded by Hannah.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.g7welcomingcommittee.com/discography/g7059.php |title=The Recovered EP // G7 Welcoming Committee Records |publisher=G7welcomingcommittee.com |date=2010-04-06 |access-date=2011-03-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130124001714/http://www.g7welcomingcommittee.com/discography/g7059.php |archive-date=2013-01-24 }}</ref> A split 7" with [[Sacrifice (band)|Sacrifice]] followed that December, featuring Propagandhi covering [[Corrosion of Conformity]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://propagandhi.com/2010/08/1015/ |title=Split 7" with Sacrifice!!! |publisher=propagandhi.com |date=2010-08-28 |access-date=2011-03-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120713175657/http://propagandhi.com/2010/08/1015/ |archive-date=2012-07-13 }}</ref>  In collaboration with their friends and fellow musicians from Sheet Happens Publishing and [[Protest the Hero]], Propagandhi also released a [[tablature]] transcription of ''Supporting Caste'' for guitar and bass in early 2012.

The group began plans for a new record shortly after completing ''Supporting Caste''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/32289 |title=Chris Hannah (Propagandhi) |publisher=Punknews.org |access-date=2011-03-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.issueoriented.com/news/episode-41-now-playing-propagandhi-mike-hale/ |title=Episode 41 Now Playing!

===''Victory Lap'' (2015–present)===
David Guillas has not been part of the touring lineup as of September 2015, and the band soon after recruited Floridian musician, Sulynn Hago, as their new touring guitarist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Propagandhi Job Posting!
