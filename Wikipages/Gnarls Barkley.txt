'''Gnarls Barkley''' is an American [[soul music|soul]] duo, composed of singer-songwriter [[CeeLo Green]] and producer [[Danger Mouse (musician)|Danger Mouse]]. They released their debut studio album, ''[[St. Elsewhere (album)|St. Elsewhere]]'', in 2006. It contained their hit single "[[Crazy (Gnarls Barkley song)|Crazy]]", which peaked at number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|US Hot 100]] and topped the [[UK Singles Chart]]. It was nominated at the 2007 [[Grammy Award]]s for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]], and was platinum certified for shipping over 1,000,000 records.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://djbooth.net/news/entry/gnarls-barkley-receives-riaa-platinum-certification|title=Gnarls Barkley Receives RIAA Platinum Certification – DJBooth|website=DJBooth.net|access-date=March 19, 2016}}</ref> ''St. Elsewhere'' also received a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]. ''[[The Odd Couple (album)|The Odd Couple]]'', their second studio album, was scheduled for release in April 2008, but due to a leak of the album over the internet, they decided to release it early.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/riff/2008/03/new-leaked-music-gnarls-barkley-odd-couple|title=New (Leaked) Music: Gnarls Barkley – The Odd Couple|website=Mother Jones|access-date=March 19, 2016}}</ref> The album in its entirety received good reviews, but it did not have as much commercial success as their first album.

==History==
===Background===
CeeLo Green first entered the scene as part of the [[Atlanta]] [[hip hop music|hip hop]] group [[Goodie Mob]] which had a large hand in the [[Southern hip hop|Dirty South]] movement of the 1990s. Green left the group after their third album in 1999 and started his solo career. That year he sang on "Do You Like the Way" along with [[Lauryn Hill]] on [[Santana (band)|Santana]]'s multi-platinum ''[[Supernatural (Santana album)|Supernatural]]'' album.

Brian Joseph Burton, better known by his stage name [[Danger Mouse (musician)|Danger Mouse]], has produced albums for a number of hip hop and rock artists, including [[Gorillaz]]' ''[[Demon Days]]'', and [[The Black Keys]]' ''[[Attack & Release]]'', ''[[El Camino (The Black Keys album)|El Camino]]'', and ''[[Turn Blue (album)|Turn Blue]]''. He received international attention for his [[Mashup (music)|mash-up]] ''[[The Grey Album]]'', which blended the [[a cappella]] edition of [[Jay-Z]]'s ''[[The Black Album (Jay-Z album)|The Black Album]]'' with samples from [[The Beatles]]' ''[[The Beatles (album)|White Album]]''.

The duo first crossed paths while Green was performing at the University of Georgia and Danger Mouse won a contest to DJ. They became musical partners and worked together on the songs that would become ''St. Elsewhere''; prior to the release of that album they collaborated on the songs "What You Sittin' On?" for [[Lex Records]] in 2004, and "Benzie Box" from the [[Danger Doom]] album ''[[The Mouse and the Mask]]'' in 2005.

====Band name====
In 2006, [[Sanjiv Bhattacharya]] interviewed the duo for ''[[The Guardian]]'' and asked about where their band name came from, to which Green replied: "You ask me why we're called Gnarls Barkley and I'm asking you 'why not?'...The name Gnarls Barkley isn't anchored down. It's a drifter. A [[High Plains Drifter|High Plains drifter]], I might add".<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/apr/23/urban.popandrock|title=Plain crazy|last=Bhattacharya|first=Sanjiv|date=April 23, 2006|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=March 20, 2016}}</ref> Danger Mouse said: "There's no story behind it...The name doesn't have anything to do with anything".<ref name=":1" /> Although many people believe that their name has something to do with former [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] player [[Charles Barkley]]; when Bhattacharya asked them about it, Danger Mouse replied: "Nope. It's just like everything else on this record. There was no conscious decision about stuff".<ref name=":1" />

According to a ''Billboard'' article: "Burton and CeeLo have been cagey about what the name of the act means, and each live performance is an opportunity to play dress-up as tennis players, astronauts and chefs, among many other get-ups. The costuming extends to photo shoots, as Burton and Cee Lo would rather impersonate characters from such films as ''[[Back to the Future]]'' or ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]''." They also have dressed up as characters from films ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' and ''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]''.

CeeLo Green said in an interview: <blockquote>That is that electric industrial Euro soul, that's what I call it ... if I can call it anything. It truly is shapeless and formless. My style and my approach is still water, and it runs so deep. So, with that project I got a chance to be a lil' zany, of course a continuation of eccentricity, abstract and vague, and all of those wonderful things that make art exactly what it is. And that's subject to interpretation. As far as the artiste himself, it does cater to and extend the legacy of Cee Lo Green, and showcase the diversity and range and intention of Cee Lo Green. It is a great project that I'm very, very proud of.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thickonline.com/interviews/index.php?mod=cnt&act=cnt&id=1143&page=2 |title=Interviews |publisher=ThickOnline.com |date=July 31, 2006 |access-date=May 9, 2011}}</ref></blockquote>

===''St. Elsewhere'' (2006–2007)===
Downtown/Atlantic in the United States and Warners Bros. Records in the United Kingdom signed the band after several songs, including "[[Crazy (Gnarls Barkley song)|Crazy]]", were played for them by [[Danger Mouse (musician)|Danger Mouse]]'s management company [[Waxploitation]].<ref>{{cite web | year=2006 |title= Interview – Josh Deutsch, A&R for Gnarls Barkley (No.1 UK) – Sep 04, 2006 |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/2006/September4_0_0_1.html | publisher = [[HitQuarters]] | access-date=November 9, 2006}}</ref> "Crazy" was released as their first [[Single (music)|single]] on April 3, 2006, preceded by its release as digital download and 12" [[vinyl record]] single in March 2006. It gained some of its popularity due to its use on primetime [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[Zane Lowe]]'s television advert, and it was also made Record of the Week by [[Ken Bruce]] of [[BBC Radio 2]], [[Scott Mills]] and [[Jo Whiley]] of BBC Radio 1 as well as being made 'Weekend Anthem' by [[DJ Spoony]] and [[Sara Cox]] (also of Radio 1).

In an interview with journalist Stephen Mooallem about "Crazy", Mooallem asked the duo, "Is it true that Cee-Lo recorded the vocals for "Crazy" in just one take?" to which Danger Mouse replied, "Yeah. He had the words written on paper, and what you hear on the album was the first time he ever tried singing it. He went in and gave it a shot, really just to see what it would sound like. We just kept it because it sounded great."{{cite quote|date=February 2021}} The song was, in addition, considered by the duo to be an "independent joint venture," paid for entirely "out-of-pocket." Catapulting the two into stardom, the single was primarily responsible for their success, as they "didn't even have a formal deal in place" until the song hit No. 1.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

In the United Kingdom, "Crazy" became the first ever single to top the [[UK Singles Chart]] purely on download sales as it was released online a week before it was released as a CD single.<ref>{{cite news |title= Crazy song makes musical history |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4870150.stm | work = BBC News | access-date=April 2, 2006 | date=April 2, 2006}}</ref> It was also the first single to top the [[UK Singles Chart]] for nine weeks consecutively since 1994 when [[Wet Wet Wet]]'s "[[Love Is All Around (The Troggs song)|Love Is All Around]]" was number one for fifteen weeks (the last song to spend exactly nine weeks on top was "Two Tribes" by [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]] in 1984). It has also equaled the [[Queen (band)|Queen]] 1975 classic "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]", which also topped the UK Singles Chart for nine weeks. Gnarls Barkley announced that as the record had spent its ninth week at number one, it was to be deleted as a vinyl/CD listing from May 28, 2006, so people will "remember the song fondly and not get sick of it".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/therazz/tm_objectid=17140356%26method=full%26siteid=66633%26headline=gnarls%2dgo%2dout%2don%2dtop%2d-name_page.html|title=Gnarls Go Out On Top|access-date=May 28, 2006|work=The Daily Record}}</ref>
"Crazy" is also the longest number-one on the [[UK Official Download Chart]] with its stay lasting eleven consecutive weeks. In late 2009 the song was voted as the best song of the decade by Rolling Stone magazine.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/31248926/100_best_songs_of_the_decade/25 |title=100 Best Songs of the Decade |date=December 9, 2009}}</ref>

The group released their debut album, ''[[St. Elsewhere (album)|St. Elsewhere]]'', on April 24, 2006, in the United Kingdom and on May 9, 2006, in their native United States. For their American television debut on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', May 24, 2006, the band performed "Crazy".

They performed along with [[Christina Aguilera]], [[AFI (band)|AFI]], and [[Wolfmother]] at the [[MTV Movie Awards 2006]] on June 8, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|last=Carroll |first=Larry |url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1530297/story.jhtml |title=2007 Movie Awards Story &#124; Justin, Luda To Appear At Movie Awards – Show Story &#124; Headlines |publisher=MTV |date=May 8, 2006 |access-date=December 19, 2012}}</ref> They were dressed as characters from the film series ''[[Star Wars]]''. [[Rebel Alliance]] pilots, Imperial officers, [[Imperial Stormtroopers|Stormtroopers]], [[Chewbacca]], [[Jango Fett]], [[Obi-Wan]], with Cee-Lo singing as an unmasked [[Darth Vader]].

In October 2006, Gnarls Barkley recorded a live session for ''[[Live from Abbey Road]]'' at [[Abbey Road Studios]].

''St. Elsewhere'' has been certified Platinum by the RIAA for selling over 1,000,000 albums in the United States. A limited edition deluxe package of ''St. Elsewhere'' was released on November 7, 2006. The CD+DVD package includes a 92-page booklet, four music videos and bonus songs from live performance.<ref name=":0" />

''St. Elsewhere'' was nominated for four [[Grammy Award]]s in 2007 including for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]], and [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], winning two of them for Best Alternate Music Album, and Best Urban/Alternate Performance for "[[Crazy (Gnarls Barkley song)|Crazy]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/news/grammy-rewind-49th-annual-grammy-awards|title=GRAMMY Rewind: 49th Annual GRAMMY Awards|website=The GRAMMYs|access-date=March 19, 2016}}</ref>

"[[Crazy (Gnarls Barkley song)|Crazy]]" was featured in a couple of TV shows and movies, like The Big Short, Medium, Kick-Ass, I Think I Love My Wife, Religulous, Cold Case, How to Rock, Grey's Anatomy, Boyhood, and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.
[[File:Gnarls Barkley in Melbourne.jpg|thumb|right|Gnarls Barkley at the Mini V festival in Melbourne, 2007]]
From January until March 2007, they toured with the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] through the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.redhotchilipeppers.com/news/news.php?uid=333 |title=NEWS |publisher=Redhotchilipeppers.com |date=July 24, 2010 |access-date=May 9, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103101113/http://redhotchilipeppers.com/news/news.php?uid=333 |archive-date=January 3, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

They did a collaborative short film in both the Spring of 2006 and 2007 with the international TV series ''[[Kung Faux]]'' which airs heavily on [[Channel V]] around the world, and they also toured Australia in March and April 2007 as part of the Channel V Festival.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===''The Odd Couple'' (2008)===
In early March 2008, the duo's second album, ''[[The Odd Couple (album)|The Odd Couple]]'', was leaked over the internet prompting the duo to push the release date up from April 8. In an interview with Entertainment Magazine, Danger Mouse said that he "knew it [the leak] was coming...every day, I expected to get a call saying it leaked, and eventually I got a call saying it leaked."{{cite quote|date=February 2021}} On March 18, 2008, the album became available via download on the [[iTunes Store]] and [[Amazon MP3]]. Hard copies of the album were released on March 25.

Prior to its official release, Green spoke to the album's anti-formulaic qualities, noting bluntly that "there's no formula to it," and that to expect the same wild success of ''St. Elsewhere'' is to neglect the ever-present "risk factor in any artistic endeavor." He called it something of an "act of faith" – a true, earnest attempt to create and disseminate a piece of art to those who would seek out its conception.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

They appeared as the musical guest on the April 12, 2008 episode of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]].'' They were supposed to be in a [[SNL Digital Shorts|Digital Short]] parodying amateur music videos according to the scrolled text but only appeared in the singing performances of the live broadcast.

On November 11, 2008, they released an [[Extended play|EP]], ''Who's Gonna Save My Soul'', featuring four versions of the song which originally appeared on ''The Odd Couple'', along with a live version of "Neighbors" and a previously unreleased song, "Mystery Man." A music video for "Mystery Man" was directed by [[Walter Robot]] and premiered on [[Yahoo! Music]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1043704/gnarls-barkley-bares-its-soul-on-new-ep |title = Gnarls Barkley Bares Its 'Soul' On New EP |access-date = October 28, 2008 |author = Cohen, Jonathan |date = October 22, 2008 |magazine = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref>

===Third studio album (2013–present)===
In 2013, Green stated they would be releasing a third album sometime in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/bbma-2013/1562998/cee-lo-green-to-release-three-projects-announces-goodie-mobs-album |title=Cee-Lo Green to Release Three Projects, Announces Goodie Mob's Album Release Date |publisher=Billboard |access-date=November 7, 2013}}</ref> In late 2017, Green stated "We have already started on a new [Gnarls Barkley] album, we're halfway in and we have some overtures from the other projects that may not have stood the test of time, we don't know yet."<ref>{{cite web |title=CeeLo Green is "Cookin Up" a "Prequel" to Gnarls Barkley's Brand New Album (Exclusive) |url=https://djbooth.net/features/2017-12-20-ceelo-green-interview-gnarls-barkley |website=DJBooth.net}}</ref> In July 2020, he revealed that the [[COVID-19 lockdowns|COVID-19 lockdown]] happened as he was working on this third effort.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lanham|first=Tom|date=July 9, 2020|title=Q&A: CeeLo Green|url=http://illinoisentertainer.com/2020/07/qa-ceelo-green/|access-date=2020-08-03|website=Illinois Entertainer}}</ref>
