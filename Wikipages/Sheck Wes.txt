== Legal issues ==
On January 31, 2019, Ridge Productions claimed Fall had refused to pay for the video for his forthcoming single "Mudboy". Ridge Productions posted the original edit of the video, with substituted audio mocking Fall and his crew for reneging on their agreement.<ref>{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Aaron |date=February 1, 2019 |title=Sheck Wes Gets Trolled By A Video Producer Who Says Sheck Didn't Pay Him For Shooting The 'Gmail' Video |url= https://uproxx.com/hiphop/sheck-wes-gmail-video-trolled-ridge-production |access-date=February 1, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Beschizza |first=Rob |date=February 1, 2019 |title=Production company posts funny remix after rapper refuses to pay for music video |url=https://boingboing.net/2019/02/01/production-company-posts-funny.html |access-date=February 1, 2019}}</ref>

In February 2019, Fall was caught on video stalking his former partner, the singer [[Justine Skye]]. After Justine Skye came out publicly about Fall abusing her, former classmates of his high school stated that he did abuse other women before at school. In April 2019 he dated social media personality India Love. In June 2019 she posted and deleted a picture of a black eye that hinted Fall abused her after their break up. Later on in the year they rekindled their relationship. In June 2020 they had a public dispute. India even hinted that Fall abused her after she posted a picture with a black eye with the caption “This is why we are over Sheck, stop telling people I cheated on you”. She would later take that post down.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/12/rapper-sheck-wes-accused-of-stalking-and-domestic-violence |title=Rapper Sheck Wes accused of stalking and domestic violence |last=Beaumont-Thomas |first=Ben |date=February 12, 2019 |work=The Guardian |access-date=February 17, 2019 |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://metro.co.uk/2019/02/12/sheck-wes-justine-skye-accused-abusing-8549014/ |title=Who is Sheck Wes, whom Justine Skye has accused of abusing her? |date=February 12, 2019 |website=Metro |language=en |access-date=February 17, 2019}}</ref> Fall was removed from an advertising campaign for [[Major League Soccer]] in response to the allegations.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.vibe.com/2019/02/sheck-wes-mls-campaign-removed |title=Sheck Wes Pulled From Campaign After Abuse Allegations |date=February 14, 2019 |website=Vibe |language=en |access-date=February 17, 2019}}</ref> Skye was subsequently reported to have requested a [[restraining order]] against Fall.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.spin.com/2019/02/justine-skye-sheck-wes-restraining-order/ |title=Justine Skye Requests Restraining Order Against Sheck Wes [UPDATE] |date=February 15, 2019 |website=Spin |access-date=February 17, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://theblast.com/justine-skye-restraining-order-sheck-wes/ |title=Singer Justine Skye Files Restraining Order Against Sheck Wes |last1=Trock |first1=Gary |last2=Walters |first2=Liz |date=February 15, 2019 |website=The Blast |language=en-US |access-date=February 17, 2019}}</ref> Fall has denied the allegations and no charges were ever brought forward.<ref name=":0" /> Skye's one-time boyfriend, rapper [[GoldLink]], has repeatedly insulted and criticized Fall publicly over the abuse allegations.<ref name=Complex>{{cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/goldlink-disses-sheck-wes-new-album|title=GoldLink Disses Sheck Wes on "White Walls," Announces New Album|first=FNR|last=Tigg|work=Complex|date=June 9, 2021|access-date=November 18, 2021}}</ref>
