Alpert was born into a family of musicians. His father, although a tailor by trade, was also a talented [[mandolin]] player. His mother taught violin at a young age, and his older brother, David, was a talented young drummer.<ref name="bookref1">{{cite book|last=Stephen Vincent O'Rourke|title=The Herb Alpert File|date=January 2008|page=2|isbn=978-0-615-17300-9}}</ref> Herb began trumpet lessons at the age of eight and played at dances as a teenager. Acquiring an early [[Wire recording|wire recorder]] in high school, he experimented on this crude equipment. After graduating from [[Fairfax High School (West Hollywood)|Fairfax High School]] in 1952, he joined the [[United States Army]] and frequently performed at military ceremonies. After his service in the Army, Alpert tried his hand at acting, but eventually settled on pursuing a career in music.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

While attending the [[University of Southern California]] in the 1950s, he was a member of the [[Spirit of Troy|USC Trojan Marching Band]] for two years. In 1956, he appeared in the uncredited role as "Drummer on Mt. Sinai" in ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049833/fullcredits#cast|title=The Ten Commandments (1956) – Full cast and crew|publisher=IMDb.com|access-date=August 18, 2015}}</ref>

In 1957 Alpert teamed up with Rob Weerts, another burgeoning lyricist, as a songwriter for Keen Records. A number of songs written or co-written by Alpert during the following two years became Top 20 hits, including "[[Baby Talk (Jan and Dean song)|Baby Talk]]" by [[Jan and Dean]] and "[[Wonderful World (Sam Cooke song)|Wonderful World]]" by [[Sam Cooke]].<ref name="herbalpert.com">{{cite web|year=1996|url=http://www.herbalpert.com/biocomponents/chrono.html|title=Herb Alpert – Chronology|publisher=Almo Sounds, Inc.|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617105155/http://herbalpert.com/biocomponents/chrono.html|archive-date=June 17, 2006}}</ref> In 1960, he began his recording career as a vocalist at RCA Records under the name of Dore Alpert.<ref name=herbert /> In 1962, Alpert and his new business partner [[Jerry Moss]] formed [[Carnival Records]] with "Tell It to the Birds" being the first release on the Alpert & Moss label with distribution outside of Los Angeles done by [[Dot Records]]. After Carnival released its second single "Love Is Back In Style" by Charlie Robinson, Alpert and Moss found that there was prior usage of the Carnival name and renamed their label A&M Records.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==The Tijuana Brass years==
{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2017}}
Alpert set up a small recording studio in his garage and had been [[overdubbing]] a tune called "Twinkle Star", written by Sol Lake, who would eventually write many of the Brass's original tunes. During a visit to [[Tijuana]], Mexico, Alpert happened to hear a [[mariachi]] band while attending a [[Bullfighting|bullfight]]. Following the experience, Alpert recalled that he was inspired to find a way to express musically what he felt while watching the wild responses of the crowd, and hearing the brass musicians introducing each new event with rousing fanfare.<ref>{{cite web|date=1997–2006|url=http://www.tijuanabrass.com/|title=Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass Discography at A&M Corner|publisher=A&M Corner}}</ref> Alpert adapted the trumpet style to the tune, [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] in crowd cheers and other noises for ambience, and renamed the song "[[The Lonely Bull]]".<ref name=pc24>{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19779/m1/ |title=Show 24 – The Music Men.

He personally funded the production of the record as a single, and it spread through [[Radio personality|radio DJs]] until it caught on and became a Top 10 hit in the Fall of 1962. He followed up quickly with his debut album, ''[[The Lonely Bull (album)|The Lonely Bull]]'' by "Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass". Originally the Tijuana Brass was just Alpert overdubbing his own trumpet, slightly out of sync.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historyofmusic.ca/2017/08/09/the-lonely-bull/|title=The Lonely Bull – Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass – This Day in the History of Music|website=historyofmusic.ca|language=en-US|access-date=October 10, 2017}}</ref> The title cut reached No. 6 on the ''Billboard'' Pop Singles chart. This was A&M's first album with the original release number being #101, although it was recorded at Conway Records.  For this album and subsequent releases, Alpert recorded with the group of L.A. session musicians known as [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|The Wrecking Crew]], whom he holds in high regard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_682_-_herb_alpert_mark_jay_duplass|title=Episode 682 - Herb Alpert / Mark & Jay Duplass|website=Wtfpod.com|access-date=October 20, 2019}}</ref>
[[File:Herb Alpert 1966.JPG|thumb|left|Alpert in 1966]]
By the end of 1964, because of a growing demand for live appearances by the Tijuana Brass, Alpert [[audition]]ed and hired a team of crack [[Session musician|session men]]. Alpert used to tell his audiences that his group consisted of "Four [[lasagna]]s, two [[bagel]]s, and an [[American cheese]]": [[John Pisano]] (electric guitar); Lou Pagani (piano); [[Nick Ceroli]] (drums); [[Pat Senatore]] (bass guitar); Tonni Kalash (trumpet); Herb Alpert (trumpet and vocal); and Bob Edmondson ([[trombone]]). The band debuted in 1965, and became one of the highest-paid acts then performing, having put together a complete [[revue]] that included choreographed moves and comic routines written by [[Bill Dana (comedian)|Bill ("José Jiménez") Dana]].

An album or two was released each year throughout the 1960s. Alpert's band was featured in several TV specials, each one usually centered on visual interpretations of the songs from their latest album—essentially an early type of music videos later made famous by [[MTV]]. The first Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass special, sponsored by the [[Singer Sewing Machine Company]], aired on April 24, 1967 on [[CBS]]. Alpert's style achieved enormous popularity with the national exposure [[Clark's Teaberry|The Clark Gum Company]] gave to one of his recordings in 1964, a Sol Lake number titled "The Mexican Shuffle" (which was retitled "The Teaberry Shuffle" for the television advertisements).

In 1965, Alpert released two albums, ''[[Whipped Cream & Other Delights]]'' and ''[[Going Places (Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass album)|Going Places]]''. ''Whipped Cream'' sold over 6 million copies in the United States. The album cover featured model [[Dolores Erickson]] wearing only what appeared to be whipped cream. In reality, Erickson was wearing a white blanket over which were scattered artfully placed daubs of shaving cream—real whipped cream would have melted under the heat of the studio lights (although the cream on her finger was real). In concerts, when about to play the song, Alpert would tell the audience, "Sorry, we can't play the cover for you." The art was [[parodied]] by several groups including one-time A&M band [[Clam Dip & Other Delights|Soul Asylum]] and by comedian [[Pat Cooper]] for his album ''Spaghetti Sauce and Other Delights''. The singles included the title cut, "[[Lollipops and Roses (song)|Lollipops and Roses]]", and "[[A Taste of Honey (song)|A Taste of Honey]]". The latter won a Grammy Award for Record of the Year. ''Going Places'' produced four more singles: "Tijuana Taxi", "[[Spanish Flea]]", "Third Man Theme", and "[[Zorbas|Zorba the Greek]]". "Tijuana Taxi" and "Spanish Flea" would be used in the 1966 [[Academy Award]]-winning animated short ''[[A Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass Double Feature]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060503/?ref_=_46|title=A Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass Double Feature|access-date=January 14, 2018}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The Brass covered the [[Bert Kaempfert]] tune "Happy Trumpeter", retitling it "Magic Trumpet". Alpert's rendition contained a bar that coincided with a [[Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company|Schlitz]] beer tune, "When you're out of Schlitz, you're out of beer." ("The Maltese Melody" was another Alpert cover of a Kaempfert original.) Another commercial use was a tune called "El Garbanzo", which was featured in [[Sunoco]] ads ("They're movin', they're movin', people in the know, they're movin' to Sunoco"). In 1967, the Tijuana Brass performed [[Burt Bacharach]]'s title cut to the first movie version of ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/28/movies/casino-royale-is-an-lp-bond-with-a-gilt-edge.html|title='Casino Royale' Is an LP Bond With a Gilt Edge|last=Panek|first=Richard|date=July 28, 1991|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 10, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Many of the tracks from ''Whipped Cream'' and ''Going Places'' received a great deal of [[airplay (song)|airplay]], and many were used as [[incidental music]], such as on the American television game show ''[[The Dating Game]]'', which featured "Whipped Cream", "Spanish Flea", and "Lollipops and Roses". Despite the popularity of his singles, Alpert's albums outsold and outperformed them on the [[Record chart|charts]]. Alpert and the Tijuana Brass won six [[Grammy Awards]].  Fifteen of their albums won [[gold album|gold]] discs, and fourteen won [[gold album|platinum]] discs. From the week ending October 16, 1965 through the week ending April 29, 1967, the group had at least one album in the Top 10, marking 81 consecutive weeks.  For many of these weeks, more than one album registered in the Top 10. In 1966, over 13&nbsp;million Alpert recordings were sold, outselling the [[Beatles]]. That same year, the ''[[Guinness Book of Records|Guinness Book of World Records]]'' recognized that Alpert set a new record by placing five albums simultaneously in the Top 20 on the ''Billboard'' Pop Album chart, an accomplishment that has never been repeated. In the first week of April of that year, four of those albums were in the Top 10, simultaneously—matching a mark first set by [[The Kingston Trio]] in late 1959.

Alpert's only No. 1 single during this period, and the first No. 1 hit for his A&M label, was a solo effort: "[[This Guy's in Love with You]]" (written by [[Burt Bacharach]] and [[Hal David]]), featuring a rare vocal.<ref name=pc24/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tijuanabrass.com/alpert/alpert1.php3 |title=tijuanabrass.com |publisher=tijuanabrass.com |access-date=November 26, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20060518094000/http://www.tijuanabrass.com/alpert/alpert1.php3 |archive-date=May 18, 2006  }}</ref> Alpert sang it to his first wife in a 1968 [[CBS Television]] special titled ''Beat of the Brass''. The sequence was filmed on the beach in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]]. The song was not intended to be released, but after it was used in the television special, allegedly thousands of telephone calls to [[CBS Television|CBS]] asking about it convinced Alpert to release it as a single, two days after the show aired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1811|title=Song Facts|publisher=songfacts.com|date=February 14, 1958 |access-date=November 26, 2010}}</ref> Although Alpert's vocal skills and range were limited, the song's technical demands suited him.<ref>Campbell, Mary.

==Post-Brass musical career==
[[File:HerbAlpert1974.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Herb Alpert at [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Schiphol Airport]] (1974)]]
Alpert disbanded the Tijuana Brass in 1969, then released another album by the group in 1971. In 1973, with some of the original Tijuana Brass members and some new members, he formed a group called Herb Alpert and the T.J.B. This new version of the Brass released two albums in 1974 and 1975 and toured. Alpert reconvened a third version of the Brass in 1984, after being invited to perform for the [[Olympic Games]] athletes at the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles Summer Games]]. The invitation led to the ''[[Bullish (album)|Bullish]]'' album and tour.

In the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, Alpert enjoyed a successful solo career. In 1979, he had his biggest instrumental hit, "[[Rise (instrumental)|Rise]]" (from the album of the same name), which went to No. 1 in October 1979 and won a [[Grammy Award]]. It was later [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] in the 1997 No. 1 [[Hip hop music|rap]] song, "[[Hypnotize (The Notorious B.I.G. song)|Hypnotize]]" by [[Notorious B.I.G.]] "Rise" was written by Alpert's nephew, Randy "Badazz" Alpert and his friend Andy Armer. "Rise" made Alpert the only artist ever to hit No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Pop Singles chart with both a vocal piece and an [[instrumental]] piece. Another Randy "Badazz" Alpert / Andy Armer song, "Rotation", hit No. 30 on the ''Billboard'' Pop Singles chart. The song "Route 101" off the ''Fandango'' album peaked at No. 37 on the ''Billboard'' Pop Singles chart in August 1982.

In 1983, Alpert returned to the world of James Bond film music, co-producing (with [[Sérgio Mendes]]) his wife [[Lani Hall]]'s rendition of the theme to ''[[Never Say Never Again]]''.

In 1987, Alpert branched out successfully to the [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] world with the hit album, ''[[Keep Your Eye on Me (album)|Keep Your Eye on Me]]'', teaming up with producers [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] on "Diamonds" and "Making Love in the Rain" featuring vocals by [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Lisa Keith]].

Alpert performed "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" prior to [[Super Bowl XXII]] in [[San Diego]], California in January 1988. As of 2021, it stands as the most recent non-vocal rendition of the national anthem at the Super Bowl.

He has continued to be a guest artist for artists including [[Gato Barbieri]], [[Rita Coolidge]], [[Jim Brickman]], [[Brian Culbertson]], and [[David Lanz]], and in 1985, Alpert performed the trumpet solo on the song "Rat in Mi Kitchen" from the album of the same name by English reggae band and A&M recording artists UB40. Apart from the reissues, the ''Christmas Album'' continues to be available every year during the holiday season. On [[Sérgio Mendes]]' 2008 album [[Encanto (Sérgio Mendes album)|''Encanto'']], Alpert performed trumpet solos backing lead vocals by his second wife [[Lani Hall]], a singer for Mendes in the 1960s, on the song "Dreamer". It marked the first time Alpert, Mendes, and Hall had performed together on the same song.

In 2007, Alpert and Lani Hall began performing and recording with a new band made up of Bill Cantos on keyboards, Hussain Jiffry on bass, and Michael Shapiro on drums.  Eventually they signed with [[Concord Records]] and released a live album in the summer of 2009, ''Anything Goes'', Alpert's first release of new material since 1999's ''Herb Alpert and Colors''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tijuanabrass.com/ |title=Herb Alpert/Tijuana Brass Discography & Collector Resource Site |publisher=Tijuanabrass.com |access-date=November 26, 2010}}</ref> They followed it up with a studio album, ''I Feel You'', released in February 2011. Both albums feature eclectic jazz renditions of pop classics along with a handful of original compositions. In 2013, he released ''[[Steppin' Out (Herb Alpert album)|Steppin' Out]]'', which won a Grammy for Best Pop Instrumental Album.<ref>{{cite web | title=Grammys 2014: Winners list| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/01/26/showbiz/grammys-winners-list/index.html | access-date=January 27, 2013}}</ref> Next came ''In The Mood'' (2014) and ''Come Fly With Me'' (2015), which peaked at No. 7 on Billboard's Top Jazz Albums chart. Also, Alpert formed a new label called "Herb Alpert Presents" in order to release his catalog reissues and his new works. The first reissues were in November 2015 with the Tijuana Brass' ''Whipped Cream & Other Delights'' and ''Christmas Album''.  Reissues of most of the other Tijuana Brass albums came in September 2016, along with another new album ''Human Nature'', which was nominated for a 2017 Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Album. In 2017, he released ''Music, Vol. 1'' and a second Christmas Album called ''The Christmas Wish'', which featured elaborate arrangements with symphony orchestra and choir.

In October 2018, Alpert released ''Music Volume 3: Herb Alpert Reimagines the Tijuana Brass,'' an album featuring updated versions of 12 classic TJB songs. The majority of the tracklist was culled from the group's first seven albums.  A single from the album, ''Wade in the Water,'' was released in July 2018.

==A&M Records and Almo Sounds==
From 1962 through 1992 Alpert [[Recording contract|signed]] artists to A&M Records and [[Record producer|produced records]]. He discovered the West Coast band [[We Five]]. Among the notable artists he worked with personally are Chris Montez, [[Gino Vannelli]] on ''[[Crazy Life (Gino Vannelli album)|Crazy Life]]'' and ''[[Powerful People]]'', [[The Carpenters]], [[Sérgio Mendes|Sérgio Mendes and Brasil '66]], [[Bill Medley]], Lani Hall (Alpert's second and current wife), [[Liza Minnelli]] and [[Janet Jackson]] (featured vocalist on his 1987 hit single "Diamonds"). These working relationships allowed Alpert to place singles in the Top 10 in three different decades (1960s, 1970s, and 1980s).

Alpert and A&M Records partner [[Jerry Moss]] agreed in 1987 to sell A&M to [[PolyGram Records]] for a reported $500&nbsp;million. Both would continue to manage the label until 1993, when they left because of frustrations with PolyGram's constant pressure to force the label to fit into its corporate culture. In 1998, Alpert and Moss sued PolyGram for breach of the integrity clause, eventually settling for an additional $200&nbsp;million payment.<ref>{{cite web|year=1999|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2003/mar/12/business/fi-alpert12|title=Herb Alpert's Vivendi Deal Has $200-Million Encore Performance|publisher=LA Times.com}}</ref>

Alpert and Moss then expanded their [[Almo Sounds]] music publishing company to produce records as well, primarily as a vehicle for Alpert's music. Almo Sounds imitates the former company culture embraced by Alpert and Moss when they first started A&M.

In 2000, Alpert acquired the rights to his music from [[Universal Music]] (current owners of A&M Records) in a legal settlement and began [[remaster]]ing his albums for compact disc reissue. In 2005, [[Shout! Factory]] began distributing digitally remastered versions of Alpert's [[A&M Records|A&M]] output. The reissues included all of the pre-1969 albums, 1979's Rise, and also included a new album, ''Lost Treasures'', consisting of unreleased material from Alpert's Tijuana Brass years. In the spring of 2006, a remixed version of the ''Whipped Cream'' album, entitled ''Whipped Cream and Other Delights: Re-Whipped'' was released and climbed to No. 5 on the ''Billboard'' Contemporary Jazz chart.

In 2012, [[Shout! Factory]] re-released 1982's ''Fandango'' on CD.

With the end of Alpert's [[Shout Factory]] contract, his releases on that label went out of print, only to be re-issued on the new [[Herb Alpert Presents]] label in 2015 and 2016.

==Visual arts==
Alpert has a second career as an abstract expressionist painter and sculptor with group and solo exhibitions around the United States and Europe. The sculpture exhibition "Herb Alpert: Black Totems", on display at [[ACE Gallery]], Beverly Hills, February through September 2010, brought media attention to his visual work.<ref name=article>Cheng, Scarlet.

==Awards and honors==
Alpert and Moss received a [[Grammy Trustees Award]] in 1997, for their lifetime achievements in the [[recording industry]] as [[corporate officer|executive]]s and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2007.

In May 2000, Alpert was awarded an honorary doctorate from [[Berklee College of Music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/872652/jazz-beat-sonny-rollins-herb-alpert-thelonious-monk/|title=Jazz Beat: Sonny Rollins, Herb Alpert, Thelonious Monk ...|website=Mtv.com|access-date=December 6, 2017}}</ref>

==Philanthropy==
[[File:2012-1104-CalArts02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Herb Alpert School of Music at CalArts]]
In the 1980s Alpert created The Herb Alpert Foundation and the [[Alpert Awards in the Arts]] with [[The California Institute of the Arts|The California Institute of the Arts (CalArts)]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alpertawards.org/ |title= alpertawards.org |publisher=alpertawards.org |access-date=November 26, 2010}}</ref> The [[Foundation (charity)|Foundation]] supports youth and arts education as well as [[environmental issues]] and helps fund the PBS series ''Bill Moyers on Faith and Reason'' and later ''[[Moyers & Company]]''. Alpert and his wife donated $30&nbsp;million to [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 2007, to form and endow the [[UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music]] as part of the restructured [[UCLA School of the Arts and Architecture]]. He gave $24&nbsp;million, which included $15&nbsp;million from April 2008, to [[CalArts]] for its music curricula, and provided funding for the [[culture jamming]] activists [[The Yes Men]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/reviews/movies/YESMEN.DTL&type=movies | work=San Francisco Chronicle | title=The Yes Men | date=October 1, 2004}}</ref> In 2012, the Foundation gave a grant of more than $5&nbsp;million to the [[Harlem School of the Arts]], which allowed the school to retire its debt, restore its endowment, and create a scholarship program for needy students; in 2013, the school's building was renamed the Herb Alpert Center. In 2016, his foundation also made a $10.1&nbsp;million donation to Los Angeles City College that will provide all music majors at the school with a tuition-free education, beginning in fall of 2017. This was the largest gift to an individual community college in the history of Southern California, and the second-largest gift in the history of the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-herb-alpert-lacc-music-20160825-snap-story.html|title=Herb Alpert Foundation to donate $10.1&nbsp;million to LACC – making studies for music majors tuition-free|first=Carolina A.|last=Miranda|date=August 25, 2016|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=December 6, 2017}}</ref> In 2020, Alpert bestowed an additional $9.7 million on the Harlem School of the Arts to upgrade its facility.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/08/arts/design/herb-alpert-harlem-school-arts.html?action=click&module=Features&pgtype=Homepage |title=With Help From Herb Alpert, Letting the Light In at the Harlem School of the Arts |date=2020-11-08 |author=James S.

==Business ventures==
In the late 1980s, Alpert started H. Alpert and Co., a short-lived perfume company, which sold through higher-end department stores like Nordstrom.  The company launched with two scents, Listen and Listen for Men.  Alpert compared perfume to music, with high and low notes.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://articles.latimes.com/1988-11-18/news/vw-650_1_herb-alpert| work=LA Times | title=Fashion 88 : For Herb Alpert, There's More Than Music in the Air | date=November 18, 1988}}</ref>

He is owner of the [[Herb Alpert's Vibrato Grill & Jazz|Vibrato Grill Jazz]] in the Beverly Glen area of Los Angeles.

==Personal life==
Alpert was married to Sharon Mae Lubin from 1956 to 1971. They had two children together: daughter, Eden, and son, Dore.

Since December 1973, Alpert has been married to recording artist [[Lani Hall]], the original lead singer with [[Sérgio Mendes]] and Brasil '66, who went on to success as a Latin pop artist in the 1980s. They have one daughter, actress Aria Alpert.

== In popular culture ==
Alpert was referenced in the first show of the fourth season of ''[[Get Smart]]'' where one of the code signals between Maxwell Smart and his contact was "Herb Alpert takes trumpet lessons from [[Guy Lombardo]]." Also, a fifth-season episode parodied the entire group as Max and 99 sought to unmask "Herb Talbot and His Tijuana Tin" as KAOS spies.

The popularity of the Tijuana Brass in the 1960s spawned many imitation groups. TJB member and composer of ''[[Spanish Flea]]'', [[Julius Wechter]], had good success between 1962 and the mid 1970s with his [[Baja Marimba Band]], which was under contract by A&M. On the other side there were cheaply produced "[[drugstore records]]" by acts such as the Mexicali Brass, Mariachi Brass, Guadalajara Brass, Bullfight Brass, Pert Lapert and his Iguana Brass,  and others. There were also several comic parodies, e. g. by the Frivolous Five's "Sour Cream and Other Delights", [[Bob Booker]] and [[Pops Foster|George Foster]]'s production "Al Tijuana and His Jewish Brass", and [[Alvin and the Chipmunks|David Seville and the Chipmunks]]' "Sorry About That, Herb!"

In the music video for [[Jeff Beck]]'s 1985 single "Ambitious," directed by Jim Yukich, which depicts an array of real-life celebrities and lookalikes auditioning to perform with Beck, Alpert appears at the very end, rushing to the casting director's table and asking, "Am I too late?"

On September 17, 2010, the TV documentary "Legends: Herb Alpert – Tijuana Brass and Other Delights" premiered on [[BBC4]].<ref name=BBC>BBC "Legends: Herb Alpert – Tijuana Brass and Other Delights" [https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/tv/2010/wk37/fri.shtml#fri_legends BBC ''Legends'' Series]. Retrieved September 1, 2010.</ref>

In 2020, "Herb Alpert Is....", a documentary written and directed by John Scheinfeld, was released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.herbalpertis.com/|title=Herb Alpert Is...|website=Herb Alpert Is...}}</ref>
