A '''poppy''' is a [[flowering plant]] in the subfamily [[Papaveroideae]] of the family [[Papaveraceae]]. Poppies are [[herbaceous plant]]s, often grown for their colourful flowers. One species of poppy, ''[[Papaver somniferum]]'', is the source of the narcotic drug [[opium]] which contains powerful medicinal [[alkaloid]]s such as [[morphine]] and has been used since ancient times as an [[analgesic]] and [[narcotic]] [[medicine|medicinal]] and [[recreational drug]]. It also produces [[Poppy seed|edible seeds]]. Following the [[trench warfare]] in the poppy fields of [[Flanders]], Belgium during [[World War I]], poppies have become a symbol of [[Remembrance Day|remembrance]] of soldiers who have died during wartime.

==Description==
Poppies are [[herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] [[Annual plant|annual]], [[Biennial plant|biennial]] or short-lived [[Perennial plant|perennial]] plants. Some species are [[monocarpic]], dying after flowering. Poppies can be over a metre tall with flowers up to 15 centimetres across. Flowers of species (not cultivars) have 4 or 6 petals, many [[stamen]]s forming a conspicuous whorl in the center of the flower and an ovary of from 2 to many fused carpels. The petals are showy, may be of almost any colour and some have markings. The petals are crumpled in the [[bud]] and as blooming finishes, the petals often lie flat before falling away. In the temperate zones, poppies bloom from spring into early summer.<ref>Simon, J.E., Chadwick, A.F. and Craker L.E.

Elsevier, Amsterdam and New York. {{ISBN|0444996265}}</ref> Most species secrete latex when injured. [[Bee]]s use poppies as a [[pollen source]]. The [[pollen]] of the oriental poppy, ''[[Papaver orientale]]'', is dark blue, that of the field or corn poppy (''[[Papaver rhoeas]]'') is grey to dark green.<ref name="Hodges">{{cite book|author=Dorothy Hodges|title=The pollen loads of the honeybee|year=1952|publisher=Bee Research Association Ltd., London}}</ref> The opium poppy, ''[[Papaver somniferum]]'', grows wild in eastern and southern Asia, and South Eastern Europe.

The flowers of most poppy species are attractive and are widely cultivated as annual or perennial [[ornamental plant]]s. This has resulted in a number of commercially important cultivars, such as the Shirley poppy, a cultivar of ''Papaver rhoeas'' and semi-double or double (flore plena) forms of the opium poppy ''Papaver somniferum'' and oriental poppy (''Papaver orientale''). Poppies of several other genera are also cultivated in gardens. A few species have other uses, principally as sources of drugs and foods. The [[opium poppy]] is widely cultivated and its worldwide production is monitored by international agencies. It is used for production of dried latex and [[opium]], the principal precursor of narcotic and analgesic [[opiates]] such as [[morphine]], [[heroin]] and [[codeine]]. [[Poppy seeds]] are rich in oil, [[Carbohydrate|carbohydrates]], [[calcium]] and [[protein]]. [[Poppyseed oil|Poppy oil]] is often used as cooking oil, salad dressing oil, or in products such as margarine. Poppy oil can also be added to spices for cakes, or breads. Poppy products are also used in different paints, varnishes, and some cosmetics.<ref name="Kryzmanski, J 1999 p. 388-393">Kryzmanski, J. and Jonsson, R. (1999) Poppy.

=== Medicine ===
[[Ancient Egypt|Ancient Egyptian]] doctors would have their patients eat seeds from a poppy to relieve pain. [[Poppy seed]]s contain small quantities of both morphine and codeine,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Meadway | first1 = C. | last2 = George | first2 = S. | last3 = Braithwaite | first3 = R. | year = 1998 | title = Opiate concentration following the ingestion of poppy seed products – evidence for 'the poppy seed defence' | journal = Forensic Science International | volume = 96 | issue = 1| pages = 29–38 | doi=10.1016/s0379-0738(98)00107-8 | pmid = 9800363}}</ref> which are pain-relieving drugs that are still used today. Poppy seeds and fixed oils can also be nonnarcotic because when they are harvested about twenty days after the flower has opened, the morphine is no longer present.<ref name="Kryzmanski, J 1999 p. 388-393" />

===Advertising===
In Mexico, [[Grupo Modelo]], the makers of [[Corona (beer)|Corona]] beer, used red poppy flowers in most of its advertising images until the 1960s.

Artificial poppies (called "Buddy Poppies") are used in the veterans' aid campaign by the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]], which provides money to the veterans who assemble the poppies and various aid programs to veterans and their families.<ref name="vfw">{{cite web|url=http://www.vfw.org/index.cfm?fa=cmty.levelc&cid=127|title=Veterans of Foreign Wars Buddy Poppy Website|website=vfw.org|access-date=2010-07-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807015526/http://www.vfw.org/index.cfm?fa=cmty.levelc&cid=127|archive-date=2010-08-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Symbolism==
Poppies have long been used as a symbol of sleep, peace, and [[death]]: Sleep because the opium extracted from them is a [[sedative]], and death because of the common blood-red colour of the red poppy in particular. In [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology|Roman]] myths, poppies were used as offerings to the dead.<ref name=autogenerated1>L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p. 173, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}</ref> Poppies used as emblems on [[headstone|tombstones]] symbolize eternal sleep. This symbolism was evoked in the children's novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', in which a magical poppy field threatened to make the protagonists sleep forever.<ref name=autogenerated1/>

The [[Remembrance poppy|poppy of wartime remembrance]] is ''[[Papaver rhoeas]]'', the red-flowered corn poppy. This poppy is a common [[Ruderal species|plant]] of disturbed ground in Europe and is found in many locations, including [[Flanders]], which is the setting of the famous poem "[[In Flanders Fields]]" by the Canadian surgeon and soldier [[John McCrae]]. In Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand, artificial poppies (plastic in Canada, paper in the UK, Australia, South Africa, Malta and New Zealand) are worn to commemorate those who died in war. This form of commemoration is associated with Remembrance Day, which falls on November 11. In Canada, Australia and the UK, poppies are often worn from the beginning of November through to the 11th, or Remembrance Sunday if that falls on a later date. In New Zealand and Australia, soldiers are also commemorated on ANZAC day (April 25),<ref name="Seal2004">{{cite book|author=Graham Seal|title=Inventing Anzac: the digger and national mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z40eykeP_IMC&pg=PA105|access-date=18 September 2010|year=2004|publisher=Univ. of Queensland Press|isbn=978-0-7022-3447-7|pages=105–}}</ref> although the poppy is still commonly worn around Remembrance Day.

Red-flowered poppy is unofficially considered the national flower of the [[Albanians]] in [[Albania]], [[Kosovo]] and elsewhere. This is due to its red and black colours, the same as the colours of the flag of Albania. Red poppies are also the national flower of Poland.

The California poppy, ''[[Eschscholzia californica]]'', is the state flower of California.

The powerful symbolism of ''Papaver rhoeas'' has been borrowed by various advocacy campaigns, such as the [[White Poppy]] and [[Simon Topping]]'s black poppy.

==History and influence==
''Papaver somniferum'' was domesticated by [[Old Europe (archaeology)|the indigenous people]] of Western and Central Europe between 6000 and 3500 BC.<ref>{{cite book | author = Jared Diamond | author-link = Jared Diamond | date = 1997 | title = Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies | publisher = W W Norton & Co | isbn = 978-0-393-03891-0 | page = 101| title-link = Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies }}</ref> However, it is believed that its origins may come from the [[Sumer|Sumerian people]], where the first use of opium was recognized.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brownstein|first=M J|date=1993-06-15|title=A brief history of opiates, opioid peptides, and opioid receptors.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=90|issue=12|pages=5391–5393|issn=0027-8424|pmid=8390660|pmc=46725|doi=10.1073/pnas.90.12.5391|bibcode=1993PNAS...90.5391B|doi-access=free}}</ref> Poppies and opium made their way around the world along the [[Silk Road|silk road]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deamuseum.org/ccp/opium/history.html|title=Opium Poppy: History|website=www.deamuseum.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}</ref> Juglets resembling poppy seed pods have been discovered with trace amounts of opium and the flower appeared in jewelry and on art pieces in Ancient Egypt, dated 1550–1292 BC.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/3198|title=Brooklyn Museum|website=www.brooklynmuseum.org|access-date=2018-11-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://melbakes.pl/baza-wiedzy/pochodzenie-i-historia-maku/|title=Pochodzenie i historia maku - Baza wiedzy - Melbake's - Najlepsze ziarna|website=melbakes.pl|language=pl-PL|access-date=2018-11-20}}</ref>

The eradication of poppy cultivation came about in the early 1900s through international conferences due to safety concerns associated with the production of opium. In the 1970s the American [[war on drugs]] targeted [[Turkey|Turkish]] production of the plant, leading to a more negative popular opinion of the U.S.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Evered|first=Kyle T.|date=7 September 2011|title=Poppies Are Democracy!"
