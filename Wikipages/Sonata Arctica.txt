'''Sonata Arctica''' is a Finnish [[power metal]] band from the town of [[Kemi]], Finland. Created as a hard rock band named '''Tricky Beans''', they later changed to '''Tricky Means''' and finally to Sonata Arctica, when they shifted to power metal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themetalforge.com/modules.php?name=Reviews&rop=showcontent&id=1298|title=The Metal Forge Heavy Metal Music Zine – news, interviews and reviews |publisher=Themetalforge.com |access-date=July 19, 2011}}</ref> The current line-up consists of drummer Tommy Portimo, lead singer [[Tony Kakko]], keyboardist [[Henrik Klingenberg]], guitarist [[Elias Viljanen]] and bassist Pasi Kauppinen. All the musicians of the band's history except Portimo also acted as backing vocalists.

As of 2019, the band has released ten full-length albums (three via [[Spinefarm Records]] and seven via [[Nuclear Blast]]), their most recent being ''Talviyö'' on September 6, 2019.

==Biography==

===Formation and early years (1996–1999)===
The band was founded by drummer Tommy Portimo and guitarists [[Jani Liimatainen]] and Marko Paasikoski in Kemi. At the end of 1995, lead vocalist [[Tony Kakko]] was added and bassist Pentti Peura joined in early 1996. Originally named Tricky Beans, they played [[hard rock]] rather than the power metal with which they grew to fame. Kakko explained that when he was invited to join the band, Paasikoski said the band was going to play "a mixture of [[Megadeth]] and [[Spin Doctors]]".<ref name=metalrules>{{cite web|title=Metal Rules!!: Interview with Tony Kakko of Sonata Arctica|url=http://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/SonataArctica2001.htm|website=Metal-Rules|access-date=June 26, 2014|date=November 17, 2001}}</ref> During their early career, they recorded three [[demo (music)|demos]] which were never sent to a recording label — ''Friend 'til the End'', ''Agre Pamppers'' and ''PeaceMaker''. According to Kakko, the band's first name was based on one of their early songs, which was "about a lady who was tricky and I didn't really know what I was talking about (laughs)".<ref name=metalrules/> Their first show was about to take place but they were still unnamed, so they had to come up with something.<ref name=metalrules/>

In 1997 the band changed their name to Tricky Means, and from that point until 1999 their style was thoroughly worked upon and ultimately was drastically changed, acquiring a strong emphasis on the keyboard melodies and relying on an easily distinguishable rhythm line maintained both by the bass and the guitar. Vocalist Tony Kakko developed a clean singing style which relies both on [[falsetto]] and [[tenor]] voices. Kakko has stated that the change of sound was influenced by fellow Finnish power metal band [[Stratovarius]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegauntlet.com/interviews/1159/Sonata-Arctica.html |title=Interview with The Gauntlet, 31 Mar 2007 |publisher=Thegauntlet.com |date=March 31, 2007 |access-date=July 19, 2011}}</ref> At that time, Pentti Peura was fired and Marko Paasikoski left due to a lack of gigging. Two months later the band got signed to a three-album deal with [[Spinefarm]], which left Marko displeased.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sonata Arctica E book, Page 35|year=2014}}</ref> The band finally changed their name to Sonata Arctica, because they thought they wouldn't be able to sell metal albums with the previous name and also because Spinefarm asked them to do so. "Sonata Arctica" was suggested by a friend of the band: "sonata" for the music and "arctica" for their home (Kemi, in Northern Finland).<ref name=metalrules/>

In 1997, they recorded a demo entitled ''FullMoon'' in Kemi's Tico Tico Studios, which was their first real metal recording. The line-up consisted of Portimo, Liimatainen, Kakko and new bassist Janne Kivilahti (who started first as second guitarist<ref name=metalrules/>). The demo was sent to [[Spinefarm Records]] by a friend of the band and a recording deal soon followed.

===''Ecliptica'' and ''Silence'' (1999–2002)===

 | description = Sample of "Fullmoon" from ''Ecliptica''. This was one of the most popular songs on the album and is a long running setlist staple.
 | format      = [[Ogg]]}}
Later that year, Sonata Arctica's first single, entitled "[[UnOpened]]", was released in Finland. Soon after, the band had closed deals with labels from around the world, prior to the release of their debut album. The debut ''[[Ecliptica]]'' arrived by the end of 1999 and had a worldwide release. Tony Kakko then decided to focus on singing and the band began seeking a new keyboard player. [[Mikko Härkin]] (ex-Kenziner) was eventually invited to fill the position.

At the beginning of 2000, Sonata Arctica was chosen to support the well-known power metal band [[Stratovarius]] throughout their European tour. Marko Paasikoski returned to the band to play bass in the wake of Janne Kivilahti's departure after the tour. According to Kakko, Kivilahti left because he thought they weren't going anywhere<ref name=metalrules/> and Paasikoski was their first choice as the new bassist since he left just before the band got their first record deal.<ref name=metalrules/>

Throughout Winter 2000/2001, the band worked on composing and recording their next album — ''[[Silence (Sonata Arctica album)|Silence]]'' — which was released in June 2001. An extensive tour followed, which included concerts throughout Europe (together with [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]]) and Japan. In 2002 Sonata Arctica made its first incursion to [[Americas|America]], putting on shows in Brazil and Chile. A live album entitled ''[[Songs of Silence]]'' was also released that year, consisting of gigs from their tour in Japan. By the end of 2002, Mikko Härkin left the band due to personal reasons.

===''Winterheart's Guild'' and ''Reckoning Night'' (2003–2006)===

In the search for another keyboardist, the band received many applications and two of them were invited for auditions. Since they were well aware of the candidates' ability, the band decided to pick the new member based on personality. To this end, they spent a night drinking with each of the potentials to find out which one would fit best into the band's personality and mentality. [[Henrik Klingenberg]] was eventually chosen and joined the band in time to take part in the tour that followed the release of ''Winterheart's Guild''. With the end of their contract with [[Spinefarm Records]], the band received invitations from most European recording labels and eventually opted for [[Nuclear Blast]].

Their third album — ''[[Winterheart's Guild]]'' was recorded with the help of the seasoned keyboard player [[Jens Johansson]] from [[Stratovarius]] who recorded the keyboard solos, while Kakko took care of the basics. The album was released in 2003.
[[File:Sonata Helmond2006.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Sonata Arctica performing in Helmond, Netherlands, in April 2006]]
In early 2004, the band was chosen as the opener for [[Iron Maiden]]'s Japanese tour. Additionally, Tommy Portimo became a father; his wife gave birth to a baby girl in March. ''[[Reckoning Night]]'' was recorded in three months and released in October, with Klingenberg introducing the use of the organ to the band. Both the single and the EP of this release remained on the top of the Finnish charts simultaneously for over six weeks. A promotional tour was to follow, but Sonata Arctica was invited by the popular [[Nightwish]] to join their European tour, and thus made a change of plans.

In early 2005, [[Nightwish]] invited the band to open the concerts of their North American tour. This tour eventually got cancelled, but the members of Sonata Arctica opted to still make a short tour, playing concerts in Canada and the United States. On October 21, 2005, Sonata Arctica opened for Nightwish at the [[Hartwall Areena]], Helsinki.

In 2006, the band released a live CD and DVD entitled ''[[For the Sake of Revenge]]'', which was recorded in Tokyo in February 2005. Then, Spinefarm Records released a compilation album to get the most out of their contract with the band, since Sonata Arctica had changed to another label. The compilation is entitled ''[[The End of This Chapter]]'' and was released in Japan in August 2005 and in Europe in May 2006.

A computer video game was also planned, based on Sonata Arctica characters and music. The name of the game was going to be ''Winterheart's Guild'', after the album. The game was to be developed by Zelian Games, and was to be an [[Action-RPG]] in a style between ''[[Fallout (computer game)|Fallout]]'' and ''[[Diablo (computer game)|Diablo]]''. The game was cancelled for unannounced reasons but a demo was shown at the Leipzig video game conference in 2006, featuring Henrik Klingenberg as the playable character. In December 2006, the band began recording their fifth studio album.

===''Unia'' and ''The Days of Grays'' (2007–2011)===
[[File:SASeptember07.jpg|thumb|280px|Sonata Arctica performing at the Galaxy Theatre in September 2007]]
On May 25, 2007, ''[[Unia]]'' was released. The album's first single, "[[Paid in Full (Sonata Arctica song)|Paid in Full]]", was released on April 27, 2007. On August 6, 2007, the band announced on their website that guitarist Jani Liimatainen had been asked to leave the band due to problems related to his [[conscription in Finland|conscription]]. He was replaced by [[Elias Viljanen]] who had already filled in for him in the band's Finnish and Japanese shows during the spring and summer.

In October 2007, Sonata Arctica headlined the [[ProgPower USA]] VIII. Later, the band supported Nightwish across their 2008 tour of the United States and Canada and headlined at the shows that Nightwish cancelled due to Anette Olzon's sudden severe sickness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nightwish.com/en/live |title=The Official Website |publisher=Nightwish |access-date=July 19, 2011}}</ref>

It was announced on September 4, 2008 that the band's first two albums would be re-released with bonus tracks by Spinefarm UK on October 6.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.komodorock.com/new-releases/cd-releases/sonata-arctica-to-reissue-first-two-albums-on-october-6th-200809047334/ |title=Sonata Arctica To Reissue First Two Albums |publisher=Komodorock.com |date=September 4, 2008 |access-date=July 19, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20091008015207/http://www.komodorock.com/new-releases/cd-releases/sonata-arctica-to-reissue-first-two-albums-on-october-6th-200809047334/ |archive-date=October 8, 2009 }}</ref>

In January 2011, the band hinted in an online interview for ''Metaleater'' magazine that they were writing songs for a new album while on their current tour. Elias is quoted as saying, "I've been working on some new riffs, quite dark. Tony's been stuck in his bed scratching notes about some girl and her 'Luna Lust'." Tommy states later, "We've just got back from Cozumel, we had a good time, had lots of beers, loads more sun and thought about putting a bit more [[Queen (band)|Queen]] stuff back into the music again." In April, the band recorded a live DVD in Oulu, Finland, entitled ''Live in Finland'', which was released on November 11, 2011 (11/11/11).

It was announced on February 20, 2012 through the official Sonata Arctica website that the new album entitled ''[[Stones Grow Her Name]]'' would be released on 18 May in Europe and 22 May in North America .<ref>{{cite web|author=bravewords.com |url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/178373 |title=> News > SONATA ARCTICA – Stones Grow Her Name Album Details Revealed |publisher=Bravewords.com |access-date=June 8, 2014}}</ref>

Concerning the progress and style of this new album, he also mentioned "The bulk of the album, we already have the demos&nbsp;..." as well as "we want to focus on making songs that work live."

Tony Kakko commented<ref name=8thannounce/> on the style of the new album as well as its album artwork upon the release announcement:
{{centered pull quote|As the music on the album is bowing more towards the "old" Sonata, meaning more power metal style elements and wolves in many of the songs in one form or another, it was clear we need a wolf on the cover.

<!-- Changes in their musical style, their lyrical style, and their influences are all good things to cover-->
When asked if the band identified themselves with power metal, melodic metal or none of them, Kakko stated:<ref name=metalrules/>

{{cquote|I always think that it's "Melodic Metal". That's is the easiest thing to me because melody is very important to me and we all think we sound something like metal so&nbsp;... haha – Melodic Metal. They are all the same for me really&nbsp;... there's so many names it's kind of confusing.}}

In a 2007 interview with C.B.Liddell, Tony Kakko cited the English rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]] as his biggest musical influence.<ref>[http://the-revenge-of-riff-raff.blogspot.jp/2012/05/warming-up-to-Finnish-metal-band-sonata.html The Revenge of Riff Raff] (originally published in the Asahi Shimbun International Herald Tribune, June 1, 2007)</ref>
