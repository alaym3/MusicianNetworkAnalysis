'''Cheb Hasni''' ({{lang-ar|الشاب حسني}}), born '''Hasni Chakroun''' ({{lang-ar|حسني شقرون}}), (1 February 1968 – 29 September 1994), was an Algerian [[raï]] singer. He was popular across the [[Maghreb]], having reached the height of his career in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He was the son of a welder and grew up in a working-class family where he was one of seven children. Hasni is most well known for his love songs, but he also dealt with [[taboo]] subjects such as divorce, romance and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]. He was murdered in 1994. Hasni's controversial lyrical content (particularly those on the 1987 hit song "El Baraka", which contained lyrics about drunken sexual intercourse) had drawn the ire of fanatic Islamist fundamentalists in Algeria and it is believed he was murdered as a result.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/16/cheb-hasni-murder-rai-backlash |first=John|last=Lewis|date=16 June 2011|title=Cheb Hasni's murder marks a backlash against rai stars|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=24 July 2015}}</ref>

==Early career==
{{one source|section|date=March 2015}}
Born in [[Oran]], [[Algeria]], Cheb Hasni was interested in performing from an early age. In an interview published in the French newspaper ''[[Libération]]'' in 1992, Hasni recounted how "everyone knew me in our neighbourhood when I was a kid. I was always walking up the road with my school bag thrown off my shoulder, singing my head off".<ref>[http://www.rfimusique.com/artiste/rai/cheb-hasni/biographie Cheb Hasni profile], RFIMusique.com. Retrieved 12 March 2015.</ref>

Hasni's first significant performance as a singer occurred when he attended a local wedding party, where the group led by the famous Naoui brothers was playing. Impressed by his voice, they invited him to perform on stage at a well-known [[cabaret]], La Guinguette. The second major launching point in Hasni's career came shortly afterwards when a producer asked him to record with Raï performer [[Chaba Zahouania]].

During the summer of 1987 the pair recorded a provocative song by Algerian standards, "Beraka" ("The Shack"), gaining them much attention. The subjects of his songs were controversial and made the song popular with Algerian youth, who contributed to the song's estimated sales of one million copies. The success of "Beraka" made Hasni famous, and a controversial subject with both critics and fanatic [[fundamentalism|fundamentalists]] already concerned over the popularity of the Raï genre. Another major hit was "El Visa" a song about migration, which sold approximately 250,000 [[Compact audio cassette|cassettes]].

==Fame==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
Like many other Raï artists based in Algeria, Cheb Hasni spent more time performing abroad (giving concerts everywhere from Paris, [[Marseilles]], and [[Boston]] to Washington DC, [[Tunis]], [[Casablanca]], and Tokyo, to name a few cities) than at home, due to [[curfews]] and musical restrictions in Algeria at the time. Hasni's last concert in his native country was on 5 July 1993, when he performed to an audience of over 150,000 fans in Algiers at an event organised to celebrate Algerian independence.

Hasni became one of the most prolific artists on the Raï scene, recording around 100 cassettes during his career. His distinctive "Raï love" style soon inspired imitators, notably [[Cheb Nasro]], who launched his career in 1988 with the hit "Pour te faire plaisir".

==Death==
Hasni's fame and controversial songs led to his receiving [[death threat]]s from [[Islamic fundamentalist]] extremists. His primary residence remained in Oran, even though his family lived in the safer environment of France. On 29 September 1994, he was the first raï musician to be [[murdered]], outside his parents' home in the Gambetta district of [[Oran]].<ref name="billboard">{{cite journal|date=4 March 1995|title=Producer of Rai Music Killed in Algeria|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Nielsen Company|Nielsen Business Media]]|volume=107|issue=9|page=48|issn=0006-2510}}</ref>

His death came amid other violent actions against notable Maghrebi performers. A few days before his death, the Kabyle Berber singer [[Lounès Matoub]] was abducted by the [[Armed Islamic Group|GIA]]. The following year, on 15 February 1995, Raï producer [[Ahmad Baba Rachid|Rachid Baba-Ahmed]] was assassinated in Oran. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Legacy ==

Despite the fact that Hasni died at an early age (26), he is considered as one of the best artists ever to have graced the [[Raï]] music. Almost three decades after his tragic death, his musical works are still widely listened to up this day, and a large number of the younger generation find inspiration in what he produced.
