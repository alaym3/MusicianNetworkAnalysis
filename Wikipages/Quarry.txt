A '''quarry''' is a type of [[open-pit mining|open-pit mine]] in which [[dimension stone]], [[rock (geology)|rock]], [[construction aggregate]], [[riprap]], [[sand]], [[gravel]], or [[slate]] is excavated from the ground.  The operation of quarries is regulated in some jurisdictions to reduce their environmental impact.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2014-07-24|title=Law Document English View|url=https://www.ontario.ca/laws/view|access-date=2020-06-30|website=Ontario.ca|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=US EPA|first=OW|date=2014-03-10|title=Mineral Mining and Processing Effluent Guidelines|url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/mineral-mining-and-processing-effluent-guidelines|access-date=2020-06-30|website=US EPA|language=en}}</ref>

The word ''quarry'' can also include the underground quarrying for stone, such as [[Bath stone]].

==Types of rock==
Types of rock extracted from quarries include:
*[[Chalk]]
*[[China clay]]
*[[Cinder]]
*[[Clay]]
*[[Coal]]
*[[Construction aggregate]] ([[sand]] and [[gravel]])
*[[Coquina]]
*[[Diabase]]
*[[Gabbro]]
*[[Granite]]
*[[Gritstone]]
*[[Gypsum]]
*[[Limestone]]
*[[Marble]]
*[[Ore]]s
*[[Phosphate rock]]
*[[Quartz]]
*[[Sandstone]]
*[[Slate]]
*[[Travertine]]

== Stone quarry ==

[[File:Marmo z08.JPG|thumb]]
'''Stone quarry''' is an outdated term for mining construction rocks (limestone, marble, granite, sandstone, etc.).  There are open types (called quarries, or open-pit mines) and closed types ([[Mining|mines]] and caves).

For thousands of years, only hand tools have been used in quarries.  In the 18th century, the use of drilling and blasting operations was mastered.<ref>Raymond Perrier: Les roches ornementales. Ternay (Edition Pro Roc) 2004, {{ISBN|2-9508992-6-9}}, p. 443–447.</ref>

==Methods of quarrying==
The method of removal of stones from their natural bed by using different operations is called quarrying.  Methods of quarrying include:
*a) [[Digging]] – This method is used when the quarry consists of small & soft pieces of stones. 
*b) Heating – This method is used when the natural rock bed is horizontal and small in thickness. 
*c) Wedging –This method is used when the hard rock consists of natural fissure. When natural fissures are absent then artificial fissures are prepared by drilling holes. 
*d) [[Drilling and blasting|Blasting]] – It is the process of removal of stones with the help of controlled explosives is  filled in the holes of the stones. Line of least resistance plays very important role in the blasting process.

Following steps are used in the blasting process; 
*1) [[Drilling]] holes – Blast holes are drilled by using drilling machines. 
*2) Charging – Explosive powders are fed into the cleaned & dried blast holes. 
*3) [[Tamping]] – The remaining portion of the blast holes are filled by clay, ash, fuse & wirings. 
*4) Firing –The fuses of blasting holes are fired by using electrical power supply or match sticks.

==Slabs==
Many quarry stones. such as [[marble]], [[granite]], [[limestone]], and [[sandstone]] are cut into larger slabs and removed from the quarry. The surfaces are polished and finished with varying degrees of sheen or [[lustre (mineralogy)|luster]]. Polished slabs are often cut into [[tile]]s or [[countertop]]s and installed in many kinds of residential and commercial properties. Natural stone quarried from the earth is often considered a luxury and tends to be a highly durable surface, thus highly desirable.

==Problems==
[[File:Carrara_12.JPG|thumb|Extraction work in a marble quarry in [[Carrara]], [[Italy]]]]
Quarries in level areas with shallow [[groundwater]] or which are located close to surface water often have [[engineering]] problems with [[drainage]]. Generally the water is removed by pumping while the quarry is operational, but for high inflows more complex approaches may be required. For example, the [[Coquina quarry]] is excavated to more than {{Convert|60|ft}} below sea level.

To reduce surface leakage, a [[moat]] lined with [[clay]] was constructed around the entire quarry. [[Groundwater]] entering the pit is pumped up into the moat. As a quarry becomes deeper, water inflows generally increase and it also becomes more expensive to lift the water higher during removal; this can become the limiting factor in quarry depth. Some water-filled quarries are worked from beneath the water, by dredging.

Many people and municipalities consider quarries to be eyesores and require various abatement methods to address problems with noise, dust, and appearance. One of the more effective and famous examples of successful quarry restoration is [[Butchart Gardens]] in Victoria, BC, Canada.<ref>{{Cite web|title=BCMEMPR, BCMTH, and NRC. (1995).

A further problem is pollution of roads from trucks leaving the quarries. To control and restrain the pollution of public roads, [[wheel washing system]]s are becoming more common.

===Quarry lakes===
{{main|Quarry lake}}
Many quarries naturally fill with water after abandonment and become [[lake]]s. Others are made into [[landfill]]s.

Water-filled quarries can be very deep, often {{cvt|50|ft||}} or more, and surprisingly cold, so swimming in quarry lakes is generally not recommended. Unexpectedly cold water can cause a swimmer's muscles to suddenly weaken; it can also cause [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] and even [[hypothermia]].<ref name=ACA>{{cite web |url=http://www.enter.net/~skimmer/coldwater.html |title=American Canoe Association explanation of cold shock |publisher=Enter.net |access-date=2012-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616161846/http://www.enter.net/~skimmer/coldwater.html |archive-date=2012-06-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Though quarry water is often very clear, submerged quarry stones, abandoned equipment, dead animals and strong currents make diving into these quarries extremely dangerous. Several people drown in quarries each year.<ref name=USDoL>{{cite web |url=http://www.msha.gov/SOSA/previousfatalstats.asp |title=US Dept. of Labor list of mine related fatalities |publisher=Msha.gov |access-date=2012-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309155406/http://www.msha.gov/SOSA/previousfatalstats.asp |archive-date=2012-03-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=GEO>{{cite web|url=http://geology.com/articles/abandoned-mines.shtml |title=on quarry drownings |publisher=Geology.com |date=2007-11-03 |access-date=2012-05-14}}</ref> However, many inactive quarries are converted into safe swimming sites.<ref>{{cite web |title=Centennial Beach - History |url=http://www.centennialbeach.org/history |website=www.centennialbeach.org |access-date=8 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=City of Coral Gables - Venetian Pool |url=https://www.coralgables.com/departments/CommunityRecreation/venetian-pool |website=www.coralgables.com |access-date=8 April 2020}}</ref>

Such lakes, even lakes within active quarries, can provide important habitat for animals.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sievers |first1=Michael |title=Sand quarry wetlands provide high-quality habitat for native amphibians |journal=Web Ecology |date=19 May 2017 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=19–27 |doi=10.5194/we-17-19-2017|doi-access=free }}</ref>
