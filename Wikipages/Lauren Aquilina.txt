==Life and career==
Aquilina was born on 23 June 1995 in [[Bristol]] to parents from [[Malta]]. Her musical origins began with her playing piano in school.<ref>{{cite web|author=Julie PeaPod |url=http://gozonews.com/25235/17-year-old-lauren-aquilina-releases-her-debut-ep-fools/ |title=17-year-old Lauren Aquilina releases her debut EP – 'Fools' |publisher=Gozo News.Com |date= |accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref> She has been singing since she was eight years old and has been playing piano since she was nine. When she was thirteen years old she attended her first [[open mic]] event and sang "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]" by [[Lady Gaga]] while her mother filmed her. Aquilina's manager (at the time), Ryan Walter, came across one of the videos and the two began working with one another putting together Aquilina's initial EP ''Fools''.

==Reception==
Music reviewing website "Sound Of The Day" praised Aquilina's vocals in her cover of [[Lana Del Rey]]'s "[[Born To Die (song)|Born To Die]]":
<blockquote>"[She] took this cover and exploded it, and took [Del Rey's] vocals to another level. She has convinced me that with her very touching and emotional feel to her voice, she can change the course of many up and coming musicians. She is just in her room with a mic and keyboard, and has something to say, imagine her in an actual studio with better equipment. This girl could be a force on whatever label she signs with. The song and Lauren remind me of the beautiful Adele. Adele has a very powerful voice and people know when she is in the room. Lauren has that presence with her beautiful voice and amazing talent."<ref>{{cite web

''Fortitude Magazine'' writer Maxie Molotov-Smith complimented Aquilina's musical approach and rated her third EP, ''Liars'', a five out of five star rating. Praising, <blockquote>"Lauren’s sound is beautifully crafted soul-inflected Piano Pop (a sound that Sara Bareilles, Chantal Kreviazuk and Regina Spektor have been known to dabble in) that conjures lifting atmospheres, honey-sweet vocals and some of the wisest lyrics that any teenage songwriter has ever written".<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.fortitudemagazine.co.uk/music/ep-review-lauren-aquilina-liars/16649/|title= Lauren Aquilina EP Review: Liars |publisher=Fortitude Magazine}}</ref> </blockquote>
