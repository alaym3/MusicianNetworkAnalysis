'''Wizzard''' were an English [[glam rock]] band formed by [[Roy Wood]], former member of [[the Move]] and co-founder of the [[Electric Light Orchestra]]. ''The Guinness Book of 500 Number One Hits'' states, "Wizzard was Roy Wood just as much as [[Wings (band)|Wings]] was [[Paul McCartney]]."<ref name="500 Number One Hits">{{cite book

==History==
===Beginnings===
Not long after the release of Electric Light Orchestra's [[The Electric Light Orchestra (album)|first album]], Wood found himself in political disagreements with the band's manager [[Don Arden]]. Following a difference of opinion during recording of the band's second album, ''[[ELO 2]]'', Wood walked out of the session, went down the road to a studio where the [[Birmingham]] group Mongrel (which included his former Move bandmate [[Rick Price (bassist)|Rick Price]], as well as drummers Charlie Grima and Keith Smart) were recording, and asked them if they would be interested in putting a band together.<ref name=WizzInt>{{cite web |last=Sharp |first=Ken |title=Roy Wood: The Wizzard of Rock |url=http://www.themoveonline.com/archive_01.html |website=The Move Online |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115045412/http://www.themoveonline.com/archive_01.html |archive-date=January 15, 2008 |date=September 30, 1994 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Wood left ELO, taking band members Bill Hunt (keyboards and [[french horn]]) and [[Hugh McDowell]] ([[cello]]) with him, as well as ELO's [[audio engineering|sound engineer]], Trevor Smith. Despite press reporting a fallout between Wood and co-founder/leader [[Jeff Lynne]], Wood denies that he and Lynne ever had a real row, blaming it on press fabrication and insisting that "We never had a real row and we're still mates now."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/wizzard-and-move-pop-legend-roy-239409|title=Wizzard and Move pop legend Roy Wood reveals his secret shyness|first=Sunday|last=Mercury|date=5 April 2009|website=Birminghammail.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/roy-wood-leaves-elo/|title=Why Roy Wood Really Left the Electric Light Orchestra|first=Martin|last=Kielty|website=Ultimateclassicrock.com}}</ref> In fact, Wood claimed that he left the group because he foresaw a fallout between him and Lynne due to their increasing differences of opinion (which he felt were caused, indirectly, by the band's management) and wanted to avoid it.<ref name=WizzInt/>

Also in the line-up were [[saxophone]] players [[Mike Burney]] and Nick Pentelow (the son of actor [[Arthur Pentelow]]). Prior to the recording of the band's second album, ''[[Introducing Eddy and the Falcons]]'', McDowell left and was not replaced (he returned to ELO), and during the recording of the album Bill Hunt also departed and was replaced by Bob Brady (also from Mongrel). Prior to the 1975 recording of the band's final album, ''[[Main Street (Roy Wood & Wizzard album)|Main Street]]'' (released 2000),  drummer Keith Smart departed the band and was not replaced.

===Chart success and tours===
The band made their live debut at [[The London Rock and Roll Show]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] on 5 August 1972.<ref>{{cite book| first= tilly| last= Tobler| year= 1992| title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years| edition= 1st| publisher= Reed International Books Ltd | location= London| page= 75| id= CN 5585}}</ref> Wizzard's second appearance was at the [[Reading Festival]] later that month. With Wood's distinctive warpaint make-up and colourful costume,<ref name=AMG>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p139289/biography |pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography by Doug Stone |website=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=7 December 2008}}</ref> not to mention regular appearances on [[BBC Television]]'s ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in which members and friends, including Wood's girl friend, singer [[Ayshea|Ayshea Brough]], variously appeared in pantomime horses, gorilla costumes or as roller-skating angels, often wielding custard pies for good measure, they were one of the most picturesque groups in the British [[glam rock]] era. In 1973 they scored their first [[Top 40|Top 10]] [[hit record|hit]] with "Ball Park Incident", which made No. 6 for three weeks from 13 January.ref>https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/ball-park-incident/</ref> Their biggest hit was with their second single. "[[See My Baby Jive]]", Wood's faithful and affectionate tribute to the [[Phil Spector]] generated '[[Wall of Sound]]', made No. 1 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] for four weeks.<ref name=UK/> It sold over one million copies globally, and was awarded [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] status.<ref>{{cite book| first= Joseph| last= Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location= London| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/339 339]| isbn= 0-214-20512-6| url-access= registration| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/339}}</ref> The follow-up, "[[Angel Fingers]]", also topped the charts for one week.<ref name="UK"/> Wizzard's songs often included lengthy instrumental improvisations.

The band's 1973 [[Christmas music|Christmas single]] "[[I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday]]" became an annual fixture on British (and Irish) radio and television. It was reissued in 1981, and a [[Gramophone record|12"]] re-recording appeared in 1984.<ref name="UK"/>

During 1973 [[Harvest Records]] released the Roy Wood solo album ''Boulders'', which he had recorded and mixed years before forming Wizzard, and which produced a Top 20 hit in "[[Dear Elaine]]". Wood said he was bored with ''Boulders'' by the time of its release and he wanted to focus on his new music with Wizzard.<ref name=WizzInt/> The subsequent heavy working schedule and strain led to health problems, and several cancelled or postponed live dates on a spring 1974 tour of the UK.<ref name="Roy Wood: The Move, Wizzard and beyond">Van der Kiste, John (2012). ''Roy Wood: The Move, Wizzard and beyond''. KDP.</ref> One highlight of 1974 was a return to the Top 10 with "[[Rock 'n' Roll Winter (Loony's Tune)]]".  Release was delayed for several weeks until the end of March, so the words 'Sorry, the word 'Spring' wouldn't fit. R.W.' were added on the label after the title. Unusually for the time, this song and the B-side, "Dream of Unwin", were both recorded and released in mono. The song was dedicated to Wood's girlfriend of the time [[Lynsey de Paul]], who repaid the honour by [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] a Wizzard flavoured song "[[Ooh I Do]]" a few months later.

A tour of the US later that year failed to bring them any commercial success there, but after meeting [[Brian Wilson]] some members guested on a [[Beach Boys]] session, which resulted in the eventual release of the latter group's single "It's OK" in 1976.<ref name="Roy Wood: The Move, Wizzard and beyond"/> According to Wood, the record label neglected to make a substantial push to make Wizzard a success in the U.S., preferring to focus promotion on England since the band were already very popular there.<ref name=WizzInt/>

===Financial difficulties===
Wizzard was an expensive band to maintain, both because of the large line-up, in terms of recording costs, and Bill Hunt's propensity to smash the pianos of the venues they were playing at. Studio time was an even greater drain on the band's finances. According to Price in a radio interview, "When we finished recording 'Angel Fingers' it was rumoured that we had spent more time in the studio than [[Paul McCartney]] had with the whole of the ''[[Band on the Run]]'' album." Whether it was true or not, this meant that most of the record company's money was spent in studio time and that the members of the band had to rely on live touring work for their income. A couple of tours in the UK and one tour of the US were not enough to ensure regular wages for the band. One by one the band members found other, more lucrative, things to occupy their time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.priceandlee.org/pricelee101_002.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504204358/http://www.priceandlee.org/pricelee101_002.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 May 2006|title=Rick Price|date=4 May 2006|access-date=22 August 2019}}</ref>

===Disbanding===
By autumn 1975 they had split, leaving a farewell single, "Rattlesnake Roll", which failed to [[record chart|chart]], and a third album, ''[[Main Street (Roy Wood & Wizzard album)|Main Street]]'', which their [[record label]] did not release as they deemed it insufficiently commercial. Wizzard had initially intended their second album to be a [[double album|double]], with one disc a set of [[rock and roll]] pastiches and the other disc jazz-rock.<ref name=WizzInt/> The label heard the rock and roll set and decided to release that as a single album, which appeared in 1974 as ''[[Introducing Eddy & The Falcons]]''.<ref name="Roy Wood: The Move, Wizzard and beyond"/> ''Main Street'', the jazz-rock set, languished in the vaults and was for some time presumed lost, but was finally released in 2000.

===Post-Wizzard===
Following the band's split in 1975, Wood and Price formed the short-lived [[Wizzo Band]],<ref name="AMG"/> after which Wood reverted to a solo career in addition to producing records for other acts, notably a 1979 Top 10 [[cover version]] of "[[Duke of Earl]]" for British [[doo-wop]] revivalists [[Darts (band)|Darts]].

On 13 November 2014, saxophonist Mike Burney died, aged 76, after a long battle with cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/central/update/2014-11-14/wizzard-star-mike-burney-dies-aged-76/|title=Wizzard star Mike Burney dies aged 76|work=ITV|access-date=6 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/wizzard-star-mike-burney-who-8112432|title=Wizzard star Mike Burney, who also played with The Beach Boys, Sammy Davis Junior and Bob Hope has died|work=Birmingham Mail|date=14 November 2014|access-date=18 December 2014}}</ref>
