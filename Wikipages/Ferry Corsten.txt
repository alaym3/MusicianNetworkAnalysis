Under the guise of Albion, Ferry Corsten produced a track titled "Air".

A trance hit, "Out of The Blue" formed spear tip of Corsten's trance sound – one that was quickly galvanized by co-productions like [[Gouryella]]'s "Gouryella" (with [[Tiësto]]) and [[Veracocha]]'s "Carte Blanche" (with [[Vincent de Moor]]).
