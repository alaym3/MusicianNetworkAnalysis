'''Raffi Cavoukian''', {{post-nominals|country=CAN|CM|OBC}} ({{lang-hy|Րաֆֆի}}, born July 8, 1948), known professionally by the [[Mononymous person|mononym]] '''Raffi''', is a Canadian singer-lyricist and author of [[Armenian Canadians|Armenian]] descent born in Egypt, best known for his [[children's music]]. He developed his career as a "[[troubadour|global troubadour]]" to become a [[music producer]], author, [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]], and founder of the Raffi Foundation for Child Honouring, a vision for global restoration.

==Personal life==
Raffi was born in [[Cairo, Egypt]], to [[Armenians|Armenian]] parents, both of whom had fled Turkey during the [[Armenian genocide]]. In 1958 his family emigrated to Canada, eventually settling in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. His mother named him after the Armenian novelist [[Raffi (novelist)|Raffi]]. His father Arto Cavoukian was a well-known portrait photographer with a studio on Bloor Street in Toronto. His older brother [[Onnig Cavoukian]], known as Cavouk, is also a famous portrait photographer. His younger sister is [[Ann Cavoukian]], Ontario's former [[Information and Privacy Commissioner (Ontario)|Information and Privacy Commissioner]].  His parents died within twelve hours of each other, his mother dying first, of abdominal cancer.<ref name=Pogrebin2002>Pogrebin, Robin, ''[[The New York Times]]'', "[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/18/arts/not-all-sunshine-for-teensy-set-s-troubadour.html Not All Sunshine for Teensy Set's Troubadour."] September 18, 2002. Retrieved on May 23, 2019.</ref> He visited [[Soviet Armenia]] once in 1972.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cavoukian |first1=Raffi |title=Raffi have you ever visited Armenia?: once. Soviet Armenia, 1972. |url=https://twitter.com/Raffi_RC/status/1445983703381938179 |publisher=[[Twitter]] |archive-url=https://archive.today/L3c34 |archive-date=11 November 2021 |date=October 7, 2021}}</ref>

In the early 1970s, Raffi frequented a guitar store near [[Yonge Street|Yonge]] and Wellesley called Millwheel, where he met other developing Canadian musicians such as [[David Wilcox (Canadian musician)|David Wilcox]] and John Lacey.  He befriended Lacey, a folk guitarist from [[Oakville, Ontario]], who helped Raffi improve his [[Fingerstyle guitar|finger picking]] (John Lacey went on to become a steel guitar player). Raffi continued playing folk guitar in various coffee houses in Toronto and Montréal before hitchhiking to [[Vancouver]] in 1972 to find "fame and fortune."

He returned to Toronto after a few years and was invited to sing for a Toronto public school.  Despite his own hesitations about singing for kids, he was an immediate success, and thus he began his career entertaining children.

After a seven-year gap in publishing, Raffi released an album, ''Let's Play'', in 2002.<ref name=Pogrebin2002 /> He moved to [[Saltspring Island]] near [[Victoria, British Columbia]], in 2008.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Raffi ran a coffee house at the [[University of Toronto]] up until 1980.

Raffi is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.<ref>http://artistsagainstracism.org/artists/</ref>

==Career==

===Children's entertainer===
Once called "the most popular children's singer in the English-speaking world,"<ref>Lei, Richard, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', “[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/style/1992/05/31/raffis-growing-pains/916301da-28d1-4bbe-ba48-802661e51234/ Raffi’s Growing Pains."] May 31, 1992. Retrieved on May 23, 2019.</ref> he is well loved by many children born in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s for his popular children's songs. His autobiography, ''[[The Life of a Children's Troubadour]]'', documents the first part of his award-winning career.  Some of Raffi's best-known children's songs are "[[Baby Beluga]]," "[[Bananaphone]]," "All I Really Need," and "[[Down by the Bay]]."

Most of Raffi's children's albums include small, simple, folk instrumentations featuring Raffi's [[Vocal Performances|vocal]] and [[Guitarist|guitar work]]. Early works included contributions from Toronto-area folk musicians, including Ken Whiteley, The Honolulu Heartbreakers, and [[Bruce Cockburn]]. Raffi also incorporated many world music sounds into his records, including "Sambalele" (More Singable Songs, 1977) and "Anansi" (The Corner Grocery Store, 1979).

Raffi preferred to play in small intimate settings. In his autobiography he notes that he turned down a very lucrative offer to perform a concert at [[Madison Square Garden]] because he thought the venue was too large for him to connect to children.  He also wrote that early in his career, he found it difficult to perform for kids under 3 years old because their short attention span was distracting to him and to the rest of the audience. This led to him taking a hiatus from children's performing in the mid 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In 1989, his album ''Raffi In Concert With The Rise And Shine Band'' was listed on the RPM Top 100 Albums chart.<ref>[http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/item.aspx?IdNumber=4952& "RPM Top 100 Albums"]. ''RPM Magazine'' Volume 50, No. 24 October 14, 1989.</ref>

Raffi is currently the president of [[Troubadour Music Inc.]], a [[triple bottom line|triple-bottom-line]] company he founded to produce and promote his work. He released recording for a number of other artists, including Caitlin Hanford and Chris Whiteley.<ref name="Inc.1981">{{cite book|author=David Farrell|title=Cavoukian builds on small stable of acts|work=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT71|date=19 December 1981|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=71–|issn=0006-2510}}</ref>

As of 2017, Raffi continues to perform and appears occasionally across Canada and the United States.

===Advocacy===
Raffi's recent<!--can we be more specific?--> musical work focuses on social and environmental causes and appeals to the generation who grew up with his children's music ("Beluga Grads") to effect change in the world. He also promotes those causes through his books, academic lectures and as a speaker. In 2007, Raffi wrote, recorded and produced the single "Cool It", a [[rockabilly]] "call to action" on [[global warming]] with Dr. [[David Suzuki]] in the chorus. "Cool It" was the theme song for Dr. Suzuki's recent Canadian tour to promote action on climate change. In February 2016, Raffi released the song "Wave of Democracy" in support of American Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] run to be the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|Democratic nominee]] for [[US presidency|US Presidency]].

===Child Honouring===
In the 21st century, Raffi has devoted himself to "Child Honouring," his vision for creating a humane and sustainable world by addressing the universal needs of children. The Child Honouring ethic is described as a "vision, an organizing principle, and a way of life—a revolution in values that calls for a profound redesign of every sphere of society."<ref>{{cite web|authors=Olfman, S. and Cavoukian, R. eds|date=2006|title=''Child Honouring: How to Turn This World Around''|quote=Introduction|url=http://www.raffinews.com/files/child_honouring/child_honoring.pdf|access-date=17 April 2014}}</ref> His "Covenant for Honouring Children" outlines the principles of this philosophy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.childhonouring.org/uploads/covenant.pdf |title=A Covenant for Honoring Children |website=Childhonoring.org |access-date=17 April 2014}}</ref>

In 2006, with Dr. Sharna Olfman, he co-edited an anthology, ''Child Honouring: How to Turn This World Around'', which introduces Child Honouring as a philosophy for restoring communities and ecosystems. It contains chapters by [[Penelope Leach]], [[Fritjof Capra]], [[David Korten]], [[Riane Eisler]], [[Mary Gordon (child advocate)|Mary Gordon]], [[Graça Machel]], [[Joel Bakan]], [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]], [[Barbara Kingsolver]], [[Jean-Daniel Ó Donncada]], and others. The book's foreword is by the [[14th Dalai Lama]]. The musical album ''Resisto Dancing: Songs of Compassionate Revolution'' was released as a tie-in for the book.

In a 2006 speech, [[Iona Campagnolo]], Lieutenant Governor of [[British Columbia]], referred to Child Honouring as a "vast change in the human paradigm."<ref>[http://www.ltgov.bc.ca/whatsnew/sp/sp_june29_1_2006.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000921/http://www.ltgov.bc.ca/whatsnew/sp/sp_june29_1_2006.htm|date=27 September 2007}}</ref>

Raffi advocates for a child's right to live free of [[Advertising to children|commercial exploitation]] and he has consistently refused all commercial endorsement offers. Raffi's company has never directly advertised nor marketed to children. In 2005, he sent an open letter to Ted Rogers of [[Rogers Wireless]], urging them to stop marketing cell phones to children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commercialalert.org/news/archive/2005/08/raffi-asks-rogers-not-to-market-mobile-phones-to-children|title=Raffi Asks Rogers Not to Market Mobile Phones to Children – Commercial Alert|website=Commercialalert.org|date=30 August 2005|access-date=10 April 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214001107/http://www.commercialalert.org/news/archive/2005/08/raffi-asks-rogers-not-to-market-mobile-phones-to-children|archive-date=14 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He also turned down a film proposal for "Baby Beluga" because of the nature of the funding, which was based on exploitative advertising and marketing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8y0hNvIkEg|title=Raffi on George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight: INTERVIEW|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=14 December 2012|access-date=30 December 2012}}</ref>

Raffi has been hailed for his work as "Canada's all time children's champion."<ref>''[[Toronto Star]]'', 10 March 1996</ref>

In October 2006, Raffi was presented with the [[Fred Rogers]] Integrity Award by the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood at the Judge Baker Children's Center in Boston, for his consistent refusal to use his music in endorsements that market products directly to children.

In 2012, after learning details surrounding the online bullying, exploitation and ultimate suicide of teenager [[Amanda Todd]], Raffi and his [[Raffi Foundation for Child Honouring]] co-founded the [[Red Hood Project]] with business owner, former Crown prosecutor, community and arts philanthropist and advocate [[Sandy Garossino]] and design professional, writer, educator and community activist [[Mark Busse]]. Red Hood Project is a movement for consumer protection for children online that launched in November 2012.

In June 2013, Raffi published the book, ''Lightweb Darkweb: Three Reasons to Reform Social Media Before it Re-forms Us'', which examines both the benefits and the dangers present on the internet and in social media.
