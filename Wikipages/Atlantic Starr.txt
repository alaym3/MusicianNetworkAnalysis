'''Atlantic Starr''' is an American band based in [[White Plains, New York]]. They are best known for the [[hit record|hits]] "[[Always (Atlantic Starr song)|Always]]", "[[Secret Lovers]]", "Send for Me", "[[Circles (Atlantic Starr song)|Circles]]", "Silver Shadow" and "[[Masterpiece (Atlantic Starr song)|Masterpiece]]".

==History==
Atlantic Starr began in [[Greenburgh, New York]] with [[trumpeter]] Duke Jones (who left the band prior to their first recordings), [[drummer]] Porter Carroll Jr., [[bassist]] Clifford Archer, [[percussionist]] and flautist Joseph Phillips, Sheldon Tucker ([[guitar]]; parted ways with the band before the first recordings), and three brothers: David Lewis ([[vocals]]/guitar), Wayne Lewis ([[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] and [[vocals]]), and Jonathan Lewis ([[percussion]] and [[trombone]]). The band's membership eventually stabilized around Carroll, Archer, Phillips, the three Lewis brothers, lead singer [[Sharon Bryant (singer)|Sharon Bryant]] (who was later replaced by [[Barbara Weathers]]), [[trumpeter]] William Sudderth III, and [[saxophonist]] Damon Rentie (who was later replaced by Koran Daniels).<ref name="LarkinSM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Soul Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-733-9|page=11}}</ref>  

In 1977, the band came to Westwood, California, and performed on the nightclub scene under the name "Newban," which they agreed to change at the request of [[A&M Records]] executive [[Herb Alpert]] when they were signed. Having already agreed to keep the Starr part of an early idea for a new band name, the members decided to add the word Atlantic, because of their [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] roots. The nine-member band were now A&M employees.<ref name="LarkinSM"/>

Throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, Atlantic Starr scored several hits on the [[R&B Chart|R&B charts]]. However, significant crossover success (onto the [[Billboard Hot 100|pop charts]]) did not come until halfway into the 1980s, with the release of their album ''[[As the Band Turns]]'' (their last on A&M Records), and the single "Secret Lovers".<ref name="LarkinSM"/> By this time, the band had pared itself down to a quintet, consisting of the three Lewis brothers, Phillips, and Weathers. In 1987 (after signing to [[Warner Bros. Records]]), the band solidified their pop success by scoring a No. 1 [[Billboard Hot 100|pop]] (and [[R&B chart|R&B]]) hit with "Always", a love ballad off their album ''[[All in the Name of Love]]''.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Following this success, Weathers left for a solo career, and she was replaced by Porscha Martin for the band's next album, 1988's ''We're Movin' Up''.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Although this album was not quite as successful as its predecessors, it did produce another No. 1 R&B hit with "[[My First Love (Atlantic Starr song)|My First Love]]."<ref name="VF">{{cite web|title=Atlantic Starr Top Songs / Chart Singles Discography |url=https://www.musicvf.com/Atlantic+Starr.art|website=Music VF|access-date=10 November 2021}}</ref>

The band continued to score hits on both the R&B and [[Billboard Hot 100|Pop]] charts into the early 1990s. 1991 saw the introduction of yet another new female lead singer, when Martin was replaced by [[Miss Black America]] 1986, Rachel Oliver, for the album, ''[[Love Crazy (album)|Love Crazy]]''.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/atlantic-starr-mn0000509356/biography|title=Artist Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=September 5, 2010|first=Alex|last=Henderson}}</ref> This album featured the band's biggest hit of the 1990s, with "[[Masterpiece (Atlantic Starr song)|Masterpiece]]" reaching No. 3 on both the [[Billboard (magazine)|pop]] and [[R&B chart|R&B]] charts in early 1992.<ref name="VF"/> The group toured to Japan in 1992 with yet another female vocalist at the helm, Crystal Blake, a studio vocalist for Stevie Wonder who had also sung the female lead parts on the minor hit title track for [[Eddie Murphy]]'s ''[[How Could It Be]]'' album and [[Young MC]]'s "[[Bust a Move (song)|Bust a Move]]."

Following the release of ''Love Crazy'', Atlantic Starr's relationship with [[Warner Bros. Records]] dissolved, and in 1994, the band recorded one album for [[Arista Records|Arista]]: ''[[Time (Atlantic Starr album)|Time]]''. That album was a commercial disappointment and the single "I'll Remember You" only made it to the fifties on Billboard's [[R&B chart|R&B]] and [[Billboard Hot 100|pop singles]] charts.<ref name="AMG"/> ''Time'' (which was David Lewis' last album with the band) found a fifth female singer, Aisha Tanner, replacing Oliver. And when 1999's ''Legacy'' was distributed by the small, independent Street Solid label, Atlantic Starr unveiled yet another lineup—one that consisted of two Lewis Brothers (Wayne and Jonathan) as well as Oliver (who had returned and replaced Tanner) and a new male singer named [[DeWayne Woods]].<ref name="AMG"/> Although ''Legacy'' received little attention, Atlantic Starr still continues to perform today and released their 14th album, ''Metamorphosis'' in 2017, featuring L'john Epps and Melessa Pierce.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Metamorphosis-Atlantic-Starr/dp/B071W2GXHR|title=Metamorphosis by Atlantic Starr on Amazon Music|website=[[Amazon (company)|Amazon]]}}</ref>

Newban/Atlantic Starr's original personal manager was Earl Cole of Cole Classic Management. Earl Cole moved with the group from White Plains, New York. Upon arriving in Los Angeles, California, the group was introduced to their business manager, Earl Harris of Harris Management in 1977 by Harris' nephew, Al Scaife of Enter-Prizin' Management. Earl Harris eventually acquired the role of personal and business management for the group and remains their manager to this day.

===Original members===
After leaving Atlantic Starr, original drummer and founding bandmember Porter Carroll, Jr. released a self-titled solo album (''Porter Carroll II'') in 1986. This album featured contributions from several prominent musicians, including [[Marcus Miller]], [[David Sanborn]], and former Starr bandmate [[Sharon Bryant (singer)|Sharon Bryant]]. He has continued to do session work since that time, and is currently playing [[percussion]] in [[Daryl Hall]]'s live band.

Following her exit from Atlantic Starr, singer Bryant embarked on a solo career and released an album in 1989, scoring several big hits on the [[R&B chart]]s, as well as a minor [[Billboard Hot 100|Pop]] hit from the project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.musicvf.com/Sharon+Bryant.art |title = Sharon Bryant Songs ••• Top Songs / Chart Singles Discography ••• Music VF, US & UK hits charts|accessdate=May 16, 2020}}</ref>

Original [[Saxophone|saxophonist]] Damon Rentie went on to a solo career of his own, releasing his first solo album, ''Designated Hitter'' in 1985. His second and third solo albums followed in each successive year (1986 and 1987, respectively). He had also previously done session work with [[DeBarge]].

Original [[trumpet]]er William Sudderth continues to follow an active schedule in the music business, performing in many diverse settings and having become one of the most sought-after horn players in the industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhjWkPNNa-o|title=Atlantic Starr - original and former member William Sudderth - interviewed by Black Pinoy|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=October 18, 2019}}</ref>

Bassist Clifford Archer currently resides in Tokyo, Japan, where he performs regularly as a musician and session player. Original member Albert "Duke" Jones remains involved in the music industry. Joseph Phillips, original percussionist and flautist is currently working with the Reverend Bryan Oakley, producing gospel music.

===Cameos===
In April 1992, Atlantic Starr appeared as themselves on an episode of the daytime soap opera ''[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]''.  They sang at local nightspot Sassy's during the episode.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Another World: Celebrity Guest Stars|url= http://www.anotherworldhomepage.com/misc1.html|website =Anotherworldhomepage.com|access-date=2015-12-01}}</ref>
