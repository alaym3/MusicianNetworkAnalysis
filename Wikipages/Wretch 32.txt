In 2011, Wretch 32 had three top-five charting songs from debut album [[Black and White (Wretch 32 album)|''Black and White'']] and amassed over a million record sales, including the single "[[Don't Go (Wretch 32 song)|Don't Go]]" which peaked at number-one on the [[UK Singles Chart]].

==Early life==
Born in March 1985 to a Jamaican family, Jermaine grew up alongside crews Combination Chain Gang and The Movement, the latter of which featured himself, [[Scorcher (rapper)|Scorcher]], [[Ghetts]], Mercston and [[Devlin (rapper)|Devlin]]. Continuing his MC career in 2006, Scott under the name ''Wretch 32'' released a series of mixtapes, including ''Teacher's Training Day'' – which featured guest appearances from Ghetts, [[Bashy]] and Scorcher.<ref>[http://www.ukrecordshop.com/item/wretch-32-teacher-training-day.html/ Wretch 32 – Teacher's Training Day], Retrieved 16 January 2011.</ref>

His mother was from Jamaica, where "wretch" meant slim or skinny. She called him Wretch as a child, and the name stuck. 32 is his lucky number and he thought it would be fun to have a number as a surname, so he added 32 to the end of Wretch.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140304212442/http://www.journal-online.co.uk/article/7757-qa_wretch_32 Q&A: Wretch 32], Retrieved 24 February 2014.</ref>
