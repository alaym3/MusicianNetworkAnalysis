A '''creed''', also known as a '''confession of faith''', '''symbol''', or '''statement of faith''', is a statement of the shared [[belief]]s of (an often religious) community in a form structured by subjects summarizing core tenets.

The earliest known creed in [[Christianity]], "[[Jesus is Lord]]", originated in the writings of [[Paul the Apostle]].<ref name="Harn2004">{{cite book |last1=Harn |first1=Roger van |title=Exploring and Proclaiming the Apostles' Creed |date=2004 |publisher=A&C Black |isbn=9780819281166 |page=58 |language=en}}</ref> One of the most widely used Christian creeds is the [[Nicene Creed]], first formulated in AD 325 at the [[First Council of Nicaea]]. It was based on Christian understanding of the [[Gospel|canonical gospels]], the [[epistle|letters]] of the [[New Testament]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[Old Testament]]. Affirmation of this creed, which describes the [[Trinity]], is generally taken as a fundamental test of [[orthodoxy]] for most [[Christian denomination|Christian denominations]], and was historically purposed against [[Arianism]].<ref>[http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/nicene.htm Johnson, Phillip R. "The Nicene Creed."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314061400/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/nicene.htm |date=2009-03-14 }} Accessed 17 May 2009</ref> A shorter version of the creed, called the [[Apostles' Creed]], is nowadays the most used version in Christian services. 

Some Christian denominations [[#Christians without creeds|do not use any of those creeds]].

Although some say [[Judaism]] is non-creedal in nature, others say it recognizes a single creed, the ''[[Shema Yisrael]]'', which begins: "Hear, O Israel: the {{Lord}} our God, the {{Lord}} is one."<ref>{{bibleverse||Deut|6:4|HE}}</ref>

In Islamic theology, the term most closely corresponding to "creed" is ''[[ʿAqīdah|ʿaqīdah]]'' ({{lang|ar|عقيدة}}).

==Terminology==
{{See also|Credo}}
The word ''creed'' is particularly used for a concise statement which is recited as part of [[liturgy]]. The term is anglicized from Latin ''credo'' "I believe", the [[incipit]] of the Latin texts of the [[Apostles' Creed]] and the [[Nicene Creed]]. A creed is sometimes referred to as a ''symbol'' in a specialized meaning of that word (which was first introduced to [[Late Middle English]] in this sense), after Latin ''symbolum'' "creed" (as in ''[[Apostles' Creed|Symbolum Apostolorum]]'' = the "[[Apostles' Creed]]", a shorter version of the traditional Nicene Creed), after Greek ''symbolon'' "token, watchword".<ref>Justo L. Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', 2nd ed., Vol. 1, p. 77.</ref>

Some longer statements of faith in the [[Protestant]] tradition are instead called "confessions of faith", or simply "confession" (as in e.g. [[Helvetic Confession]]). Within [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Protestantism]], the terms "doctrinal statement" or "doctrinal basis" tend to be preferred. Doctrinal statements may include positions on [[lectionary]] and [[translations of the Bible]], particularly in [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] churches of the [[King James Only movement]].

The term ''creed'' is sometimes extended to comparable concepts in non-Christian theologies; thus the Islamic concept of ''[[ʿAqīdah|ʿaqīdah]]'' (literally "bond, tie") is often rendered as "creed".

==Jewish creed==
{{See also|Jewish principles of faith}}
Whether [[Judaism]] is creedal in character has generated some controversy. [[Rabbi]] [[Milton Steinberg]] wrote that "By its nature Judaism is averse to formal creeds which of necessity limit and restrain thought"<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Steinberg|first=Milton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iBu5Tpc4DtcC&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&q=Judaism+has+never+arrived+at+a+creed&hl=en|title=Basic Judaism|last2=World|first2=Harcourt, Brace &|date=1947|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-15-610698-6|pages=35|language=en}}</ref> and asserted in his book ''Basic Judaism'' (1947) that "Judaism has never arrived at a creed."<ref name=":0" /> The 1976 Centenary Platform of the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]], an organization of [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] rabbis, agrees that "Judaism emphasizes action rather than creed as the primary expression of a religious life."<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Tenets of Reform Judaism|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-tenets-of-reform-judaism|access-date=2020-11-19|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}</ref>

Others,{{who|date=January 2013}} however, characterize the [[Shema Yisrael]]<ref>{{Bibleref2c|Deut.|6:4}}</ref> as a creedal statement in strict [[monotheism]] embodied in a single prayer: "Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One" ({{lang-he|שמע ישראל אדני אלהינו אדני אחד}}; [[Romanization of Hebrew|transliterated]] ''Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad'').

A notable statement of [[Jewish principles of faith]] was drawn up by [[Maimonides]] as his [[13 principles of faith|13 Principles of Faith]].<ref>"Maimonides' Principles: The Fundamentals of Jewish Faith", in ''The Aryeh Kaplan Anthology, Volume I'', Mesorah Publications, 1994</ref>

==Christianity==
The first confession of faith established within [[Christianity]] was the [[Nicene Creed]] by the [[Early Church]] in [[325]]. <ref> Everett Ferguson, ''Encyclopedia of Early Christianity'', Routledge, USA, 2013, p. 418</ref> It was established to summarize the foundations of the Christian faith and to protect believers from false doctrines. Various [[Christian denominations]] from [[Protestantism]] and [[Evangelicalism | Evangelical Christianity]] have published confession of faith as a basis for fellowship among churches of the same denomination. <ref> J. Gordon Melton, ''Encyclopedia of Protestantism'', Infobase Publishing, USA, 2005, p. 170</ref><ref> Walter A. Elwell, ''Evangelical Dictionary of Theology'', Baker Academic, USA, 2001, p. 286-289</ref>

Many [[Christian denominations]] did not try to be too exhaustive in their confessions of faith and thus allow different opinions on some secondary topics.<ref> Walter A. Elwell, ''Evangelical Dictionary of Theology'', Baker Academic, USA, 2001, p. 289</ref>In addition, some churches are open to revising their confession of faith when necessary. Moreover, [[Baptist]] "confessions of faith" have often had a clause such as this from the [[First London Baptist Confession]] (Revised edition, 1646):<ref> Barrington Raymond White, ''Pilgrim Pathways: Essays in Baptist History'', Mercer University Press, USA, 1999, p. 275 </ref>

{{quote|Also we confess that we now know but in part and that are ignorant of many things which we desire to and seek to know: and if any shall do us that friendly part to show us from the Word of God that we see not, we shall have cause to be thankful to God and to them.}}

=== Excommunication ===
[[Excommunication]] is a practice of the [[Bible]] to exclude members who do not respect the Church's confession of faith and do not want to repent. <ref> Ronald F. Youngblood, ''Nelson's Illustrated Bible Dictionary: New and Enhanced Edition'', Thomas Nelson Inc, USA, 2014, p. 378</ref> It is practiced by all [[Christian denominations]] and is intended to protect against the consequences of [[heresy |heretics']] teachings and [[apostasy]]. <ref> Chad Brand, Eric Mitchell, ''Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary'', B&H Publishing Group, USA, 2015, p. 521-522</ref>

===Christians without creeds===
Some Christian denominations do not profess a creed. This stance is often referred to as "non-creedalism". The [[Religious Society of Friends]], also known as the Quakers, consider that they have no need for creedal formulations of faith. The [[Church of the Brethren]] and other [[Schwarzenau Brethren]] churches also espouse no creed, referring to the New Testament, as their "rule of faith and practice."<ref>Martin, Harold S.: [http://www.brfwitness.org/?p=88 "Forward"], "Basic Beliefs Within the Church of the Brethren".</ref> [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] contrast "memorizing or repeating creeds" with acting to "do what Jesus said".<ref>"Creeds—Any Place in True Worship?", ''Awake!'', October 8, 1985, ©Watch Tower, page 23, "The opening words of a creed invariably are, “I believe” or, “We believe.” This expression is translated from the Latin word “credo,” from which comes the word “creed.” ...What do we learn from Jesus’ words? That it is valueless in God’s eyes for one merely to repeat what one claims to believe. ...Thus, rather than memorizing or repeating creeds, we must do what Jesus said"</ref> [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalists]] do not share a creed.<ref>Maxwell, Bill. "Leading the Unitarian Universalist Association, a faith without a creed." ''St. Petersburg Times.'' Apr 11, 2008</ref>

Similar reservations about the use of creeds can be found in the [[Restoration Movement]] and its descendants, the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]], the [[Churches of Christ]], and the [[Christian churches and churches of Christ]]. Restorationists profess "no creed but Christ".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Scott|first1=Harp|title=George A.

===Christian creeds===
{{main|List of Christian creeds}}
Several creeds have originated in [[Christianity]].
* [[1 Corinthians 15]]:3–7 includes an early creed about Jesus' death and resurrection which was probably received by Paul. The antiquity of the creed has been located by most biblical scholars to no more than five years after Jesus' death, probably originating from the [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem apostolic community]].<ref>see Wolfhart Pannenberg, Jesus—God and Man translated Lewis Wilkins and Duane Pribe (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1968) p. 90; Oscar Cullmann, The Early church: Studies in Early Christian History and Theology, ed. A. J. B. Higgins (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1966) p. 66; R. E. Brown, The Virginal Conception and Bodily Resurrection of Jesus (New York: Paulist Press, 1973) p. 81; Thomas Sheehan, First Coming: How the Kingdom of God Became Christianity (New York: Random House, 1986) pp. 110, 118; Ulrich Wilckens, Resurrection translated A. M. Stewart (Edinburgh: Saint Andrew, 1977) p. 2; Hans Grass, Ostergeschen und Osterberichte, Second Edition (Gottingen: Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht, 1962) p. 96; Grass favors the origin in Damascus.</ref>
* The [[Old Roman Creed]] is an earlier and shorter version of the [[Apostles' Creed]]. It was based on the 2nd century Rules of Faith and the interrogatory declaration of faith for those receiving [[baptism]], which by the 4th century was everywhere tripartite in structure, following Matthew 28:19.
* The [[Apostles' Creed]] is used in [[Western Christianity]] for both [[liturgy|liturgical]] and [[catechetical]] purposes.
* The [[Nicene Creed]] reflects the concerns of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 which had as their chief purpose to establish what Christians believed.<ref>[http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/nicene.htm Kiefer, James E. "The Nicene Creed."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314061400/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/nicene.htm |date=2009-03-14 }} Accessed 17 May 2009</ref>
* The [[Chalcedonian Creed]] was adopted at the Council of Chalcedon in 451 in Asia Minor. It defines that Christ is 'acknowledged in two natures', which 'come together into one person and hypostasis'.
* The [[Athanasian Creed]] (''Quicunque vult'') is a Christian statement of belief focusing on Trinitarian doctrine and Christology. It is the first creed in which the equality of the three persons of the Trinity is explicitly stated and differs from the Nicene and Apostles' Creeds in the inclusion of anathemas, or condemnations of those who disagree with the Creed.
* The [[Tridentine Creed]] was initially contained in the [[papal bull]] ''[[Iniunctum Nobis]]'', issued by [[Pope Pius IV]] on November 13, 1565.  The creed was intended to summarize the teaching of the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563).
* The [[Maasai Creed]] is a creed composed in  1960 by the [[Maasai people]] of East Africa in collaboration with  missionaries  from the [[Holy Ghost Fathers|Congregation of the Holy Ghost]]. The creed attempts to express the essentials of the Christian faith within the Maasai culture.
* The [[Credo of the People of God]] is a confession of faith that [[Pope Paul VI]] published with the ''[[motu proprio]]'' ''Solemni hac liturgia'' of 30 June 1968. Pope Paul VI spoke of it as "a creed which, without being strictly speaking a dogmatic definition, repeats in substance, with some developments called for by the spiritual condition of our time, the [[Nicene Creed|creed of Nicea]], the creed of the immortal tradition of the holy Church of God."

=== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ===
{{main|Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)}}
Within the [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|sects]] of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], the ''Articles of Faith'' are a list composed by [[Joseph Smith]] as part of an 1842 [[The Wentworth Letter|letter]] sent to [[John Wentworth (mayor)|"Long" John Wentworth]], editor of the ''[[Chicago Democrat]]''. It is canonized with the [[King James Version|Bible]], the ''[[Book of Mormon]]'', the ''[[Doctrine & Covenants]]'' and ''[[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]]'', as part of the [[standard works]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].

=== Controversies ===
In the [[Swiss Reformed Church]]es, there was a quarrel about the Apostles' Creed in the mid-19th century. As a result, most cantonal reformed churches stopped prescribing any particular creed.<ref>{{HDS|43205|Apostolikumsstreit|author=Rudolf Gebhard|date=2011-01-27}}</ref>

In 2005, Bishop [[John Shelby Spong]], retired [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] Bishop of Newark, has written that dogmas and creeds were merely "a stage in our development" and "part of our religious childhood." In his book, ''Sins of the Scripture'', Spong wrote that "Jesus seemed to understand that no one can finally fit the holy God into his or her creeds or doctrines. That is idolatry."<ref>John Shelby Spong, ''The Sins of Scripture: Exposing the Bible's Texts of Hate to Reveal the God of Love'', Harper Collins, USA, 2005, p. 227</ref>

==Islamic creed==
{{main|ʿAqīdah|Iman (concept)}}

In Islamic theology, the term most closely corresponding to "creed" is ''[[ʿAqīdah|ʿaqīdah]]'' ({{lang|ar|عقيدة}}). The first such creed was written as "a short answer to the pressing heresies of the time" is known as ''Al-Fiqh Al-Akbar'' and ascribed to [[Abū Ḥanīfa]].<ref name=Glasse>Glasse, Cyril (2001).
