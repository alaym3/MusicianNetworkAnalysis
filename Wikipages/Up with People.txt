'''Up with People''' ('''UWP''') is an American [[nonprofit organization]] that uses a five-month program involving travel, the performing arts, volunteering, and various workshops focusing on intercultural communication to teach young adults how to interact in a [[multi-cultural]] environment and create change in communities with varying needs.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vergemagazine.com/program-search/study-abroad/up-with-people-up-with-people-programme.html|title=Up with People: UWP Global Education Program|website=Verge Magazine|access-date=2019-08-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://upwithpeople.org/discover/our-impact/|title=Our Impact|date=2019-07-26|website=Up with People|access-date=2019-07-26}}</ref> The UWP current headquarters is in Denver, with satellite offices in Belgium and Mexico.

== History ==

=== Archives ===
The UWP Archives is housed at the University of Arizona Special Collections library. The archives include materials from the Up with People organization, the International Alumni Association, as well as the personal papers of the UWP Founder and Chairman Emeritus J. Blanton Belk and his wife Elizabeth "Betty" Belk. Select materials from the UWP archives are accessible on the Up with People digital collection hosted on the University of Arizona Special Collections website.

=== 1960s ===
UWP was born out of a split from [[Moral Re-Armament]]. In 1965, J. Blanton Belk dedicated his energies to creating an organization for young adults that enabled them to interact with the world through positivity and music. He created Up with People (UWP) to bring people together for the common good regardless of ideology, political affiliation, ethnicity, race, or religious affiliation. Up with People was officially incorporated as a "[[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)(3)]] &nbsp; nonprofit, apolitical, non-sectarian international educational organization<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://upwithpeople.org/discover/our-legacy/historical-timelime/|title=Historical Timeline|date=2019-07-26|website=Up with People|access-date=2019-07-26}}</ref>" in 1968 under the leadership of Belk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coloradogives.org/upwithpeople/overview#profile-details|title=Up with People|website=Colorado Gives|access-date=2019-08-06}}</ref>

=== 1970s ===
UWP traveled and performed their musical show across several countries. Notable events were performances at the [[Indianapolis 500]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Retro Indy: Indy 500 National Anthem performers|url=https://www.indystar.com/picture-gallery/news/history/retroindy/2014/05/08/retro-indy-indy-500-national-anthem-performers/8844203/|access-date=2021-03-23|website=www.indystar.com|language=en}}</ref> the [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|Cotton Bowl]], the [[White House]], [[Super Bowl X]],<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com.au/super-bowl-halftime-show-performers-2018-2|title=The Super Bowl halftime show performance the year you were born|last=Salaky|first=Kristin|date=2019-02-02|website=Business Insider|access-date=2019-08-06}}</ref> Belfast during [[the Troubles]], and the [[China|People's Republic of China]].<ref name=":1" />

=== 1980s ===
UWP continued their musical tour, performing at Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XIV|XIV]], [[Super Bowl XVI|XVI]], and [[Super Bowl XX|XX]],<ref name=":2" /> the [[Jerash Festival]], the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]], U.S. President [[George H.W. Bush]]’s inauguration in Washington, D.C., and Berlin to celebrate the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]]. This is also the first decade in which Up with People introduced a named show called ''Beat of the Future'' in 1985.<ref name=":1" />

=== 1990s ===
UWP toured throughout the '90s, performing at events at the [[Washington Monument]], Washington, DC; at the Freedom Festival in Philadelphia; the [[Earth Summit|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development's Earth Summit]]; and the first Celebration of Peace event with [[Colin Powell]] in Denver, CO. This is also the decade UWP established formal partnerships with academic universities to begin offering academic credit through their program.<ref name=":1" />

=== 2000s ===
UWP suspended touring operations temporarily at the end of 2000 until 2004, relaunching the program with a more academic focus and their current program aspects of travel, volunteer service, performing arts, and leadership development with the sub-brand ''Worldsmart Leadership Program''. Two years after its relaunch, the sub-brand was removed, leaving the program branded solely as Up with People again. Notable touring appearances during the 2000s were the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]], the United Nations Culture of Peace Forum at the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|UN Headquarters]], the 400th Anniversary of Bermuda, and the [[Rose Parade|119th Tournament of Roses Parade]] in Pasadena, California.<ref name=":1" />

=== 2010s ===
UWP continued their program with a more comprehensive focus on travel, performance, volunteering, and leadership development. Notable performances during the 2010s were performing for [[Queen Silvia of Sweden]] at the Mentor Foundation Gala, Washington, DC; the 122nd Tournament of Roses Parade; and the 100th Anniversary of [[Kiwanis|Kiwanis International]] in Indianapolis, Indiana. Camp Up with People was also started during this decade in 2011.<ref name=":1" />

=== 2020s ===
Up with People hired former board of director's member and Lawyer Vernon C. Grigg, III as the president and CEO after the retirement of the previous CEO Dale Penny. Up with People was forced to suspend its tour for Cast A2020 two months in due to the global pandemic caused by [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]], which still remains to date.

=== Super Bowl performances ===
In 1976, Up with People began to make frequent appearances at the [[Super Bowl]]; the group performed in five [[List of Super Bowl halftime shows|Super Bowl halftime shows]] between 1976 and 1986 (with Grambling State University Marching Band being the only other group having that many returns to the Super Bowl halftime show with its six appearances), and performed at the pre-game show of [[Super Bowl XXV]] in 1991. By the 1990s, the style of halftime performance they helped define during the 1970s and 1980s (which centered on themed, musical-style spectacles which aimed to "fill the field") were frequently lambasted by critics for being too dated and not in touch with modern popular culture, leading organizers to shift toward popular musicians for future halftime shows.<ref name=espn-uwp>{{cite web| last=Williams| first=Doug| title=When Up With People dominated halftime| url=http://espn.go.com/blog/playbook/fandom/post/_/id/17649/when-up-with-people-dominated-halftime| publisher=ESPN.com| access-date=1 February 2013}}</ref>

==UWP "On Tour" program==
The On Tour program is open to participants ages 17–29. Each group, after training in Denver, travels to nearly 20 communities across two or three continents, per semester, spending about one week in each community. Each week, they live with a local host family, participate in service projects, learn about various cultures through educational workshops, and perform in Up with People's musical stage production. Programs begin in January or July of each year. The program is broken into the 4 main aspects of travel, volunteer service, performing arts, and education/professional development.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://bouldercityreview.com/community/group-aims-to-spread-hope-through-song-50732/|title=Group aims to spread hope through song|last=Bernstein|first=Hali|date=2019-02-13|website=Boulder City Review|access-date=2019-08-06}}</ref><ref name=":5" />

=== Travel ===
The UWP program typically covers 8-10 countries (beginning in the United States) on at least two continents over a 6-month semester with a second semester option. The program emphasizes cultural immersion, so participants live with host families during their stay. They tour the city and learn about points of interest in the city from a local guide as well as from their host families. The program also emphasizes that their program draws from a wide range of international participants, so individuals are learning about cultures from the organized travel portion as well as from fellow members.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://fox40.com/2019/03/21/up-with-people-performance-in-sacramento/|title=Up With People Performance in Sacramento|date=2019-03-21|website=FOX 40|access-date=2019-08-06}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://upwithpeople.org/uwpontour/|title=Up with People Program|date=2019-07-26|website=Up with People|access-date=2019-07-26}}</ref><ref name=":3" />

=== Volunteering ===
The UWP program provides participants with the opportunity to volunteer in each community. They coordinate with local community members ahead of arrival to find projects that are appropriate for the community, so the focus can cover a range of topics such as park/trail restoration, education, homelessness, disabilities, local beautification projects, and more. After the completion of the project, the staff runs workshops with the students to discuss why the project was chosen, and how to identify the needs of communities in the future.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://gooddaysacramento.cbslocal.com/video/4049659-doing-good-up-with-people-volunteering/|title=Doing Good: Up With People Volunteering|last=Segundo|first=Jordan|date=2019-03-19|work=GoodDay CW 31|access-date=2019-08-06}}</ref><ref name=":4" />

=== Performing arts ===
UWP has always had a musical performance component integrated into their show that involves the cast singing, dancing, and playing musical instruments for the community they just traveled through at the end of each week. They state that participants do not need prior experience to be involved in the show.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":4" />

=== Leadership development ===
UWP has a curriculum built around creating "global citizens" through a series of workshops, community projects, and internships. Each component is designed to teach students communication skills, cross-cultural competency, and skills sets that are applicable in future careers. The internships cover backstage technical skills, marketing, public relations, and sales. They are also partnered with universities and offer optional college academic credit for participants for an additional fee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://upwithpeople.org/curriculum/|title=Up with People Curriculum Overview|date=2019-07-26|website=Up with People|access-date=2019-07-26}}</ref><ref name=":5" />

=== Typical weekly structure ===
'''Monday – Travel Day'''

The cast travels for three to eight hours to the next city.&nbsp;This time is used to create conversations among various cast members and give them an opportunity to reflect and learn.&nbsp;The cast meets their host families, and then they spend the afternoon together at their home and around the city.

'''Tuesday – Community Discovery Day'''

The cast and their local host families/contacts watch presentations from local speakers and visit sites of interest.&nbsp; They also participate in educational workshops and discussions based on the UWP Curriculum.

'''Wednesday, Thursday, Friday – Community Action Days'''

The cast and community members volunteer together at schools, at community spaces/parks, and with local NGOs.

'''Saturday – Show Day'''

Cast members rehearse for the show they put on for the community, including stage set-up, lighting, sound, costumes, and the musical performance aspects of the show.

'''Sunday – Host Family Day'''

The Host Family Day gives students the opportunity to explore the city with their host family, learn customs, and create connections.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.internationalschoolparent.com/articles/up-with-people/|title=Up with People : combining performing arts & community service in a unique learning abroad experience|website=International School Parent|access-date=2019-08-06}}</ref>
