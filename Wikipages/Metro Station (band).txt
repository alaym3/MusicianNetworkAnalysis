'''Metro Station''' is an American [[pop rock]] band that was formed in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] by singer [[Mason Musso]] and bassist/guitarist [[Trace Cyrus]]. In late 2006, the band signed a recording contract with [[Columbia Records]] and [[RED Ink Records]].<ref name="Another Cyrus, another career">{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2008/feb/15/entertainment/et-metro15 |title=Another Cyrus, another career |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=February 15, 2008 |access-date=April 23, 2013}}</ref> The band is best known for the top 10 ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' hit single "[[Shake It (Metro Station song)|Shake It]]"<ref name=chartsingles>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=metro station|chart=all}}|title=Metro Station Singles Chart History|publisher=Billboard.com|access-date=July 15, 2008}}</ref> from the group's [[Metro Station (album)|self-titled debut album]]. In 2010, tension between Cyrus and Musso caused the band to go on hiatus. In 2011, the band returned, however, it was announced that Cyrus was no longer a part of the group and Musso had purchased the rights to the name. An EP entitled ''Middle of the Night'' was released in 2013, which was led by the single "Every Time I Touch You". In 2014, Cyrus and a new drummer, Spencer Steffan, came to the band, and a new single entitled "Love & War" was released. In 2015, the band released a second full-length album, titled [[Savior (album)|''Savior'']]. After this, the band went on a U.S and European tour, announcing an EP called ''Bury Me My Love'' along with a U.S. 10-year anniversary tour. Just before the tour started, the band announced it would be their final tour and that they were breaking up. They reunited once again in 2019 and released the single "I Hate Society" in 2020.

The band is often described as a [[scene (subculture)|scene pop]] band due to the members' sense of fashion and the band's unique blend of various [[pop music|pop]] styles.

==History==

===Beginnings===
In 2005, [[Mason Musso]] and [[Trace Cyrus]] agreed to meet on the set of ''[[Hannah Montana]]'', which starred Mason's brother, [[Mitchel Musso|Mitchel]], and Trace's sister, [[Miley Cyrus|Miley]]. Sharing musical interests, they decided to form a band.<ref name="Another Cyrus, another career"/> Shortly thereafter, Cyrus recruited Blake Healy from Synthetic Joy as a keyboardist, synthesist, and bassist. Cyrus remained the singer and the lead guitarist. Musso became the group's main singer and rhythm guitarist.

Metro Station soon gained the attention of drummer Anthony Improgo, who was added as the band's drummer after the group released the song "[[Seventeen Forever]]" on its [[Myspace]] Music website. Musso sang lead on the track, The group's popularity on MySpace Music grew, and the band eventually topped the MySpace Music Unsigned Band's charts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
