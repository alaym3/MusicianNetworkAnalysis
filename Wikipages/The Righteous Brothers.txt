'''The Righteous Brothers''' are an American [[music]]al duo originally formed by [[Bill Medley]] and [[Bobby Hatfield]] but now comprising Medley and Bucky Heard. Medley formed the group with Hatfield in 1963. They had first performed together in 1962 in the Los Angeles area as part of a five-member group called '''the Paramours''',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tsimon.com/righteou.htm |title=The Paramours |publisher=Tsimon.com |access-date=2013-03-27}}</ref> and adopted the name The Righteous Brothers when they became a duo. Their most active recording period was in the 1960s and '70s, and, after several years inactive as a duo, Hatfield and Medley reunited in 1981 and continued to perform until Hatfield's death in 2003. The music they performed is sometimes dubbed "[[blue-eyed soul]]".<ref name=pc52>{{Gilliland|https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19834/m1/ |Show 52 – The Soul Reformation: Phase three, soul music at the summit.

Hatfield and Medley had contrasting vocal ranges, which helped them create a distinctive sound as a duet, also both had a strong vocal talent individually that allowed them to perform as soloists. Medley sang the low parts with his [[bass-baritone]] voice, with Hatfield taking the higher-register vocals with his [[tenor]]. His voice reached the [[register (music)|register]] of a [[countertenor]]. <ref>[https://ozgurnevres.com/unchained-melody-righteous-brothers/ Unchained melody]</ref>

Following a year-and-a-half of Top 40 non-entries on [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'''s Hot 100]], the duo hit big with the late-1964 release of what would become their signature record, "[[You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin']]" – a transatlantic number one produced by [[Phil Spector]], often considered one of his finest works and a landmark recording in popular music. Other notable hits include three US 1965 Top Tens – "[[Just Once in My Life]]" and covers of "[[Unchained Melody]]" (also a huge hit in 1990) and "[[Ebb Tide (song)|Ebb Tide]]" – and the massive US 1966 number one "[[(You're My) Soul and Inspiration]]", plus the 1974 comeback hit "[[Rock and Roll Heaven]]". Both Hatfield and Medley also had for a time their own solo careers. In 2016, Medley re-formed The Righteous Brothers with Bucky Heard and they continue to perform as a duo.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://lasvegassun.com/vegasdeluxe/2016/mar/23/the-righteous-brothers-reborn-bill-medley-emotiona/ |title=The Righteous Brothers reborn: Bill Medley's emotional Harrah's residency |first=Robin |last=Leach |date=March 23, 2016 |work=Las Vegas Sun |access-date=November 22, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122220754/http://lasvegassun.com/vegasdeluxe/2016/mar/23/the-righteous-brothers-reborn-bill-medley-emotiona/ |archive-date=November 22, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Music career==
===1962–1964: Beginning===
[[Bobby Hatfield]] and [[Bill Medley]] were in different groups before they met – Hatfield was in a group from [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]] called the Variations, and Medley in a group from [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]] called the Paramours.<ref name="medley1">{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8pX_AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA10 |title=The Time of My Life: A Righteous Brother's Memoir|author= Bill Medley |publisher=Da Capo Press |date=April 24, 2014|isbn= 978-0306823169 |pages=10–11 }}</ref> Barry Rillera, a member of Medley's band who was also in Hatfield's group, suggested they go see each other's show and perform together.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oRV3CQAAQBAJ&pg=PT25 |title=Rock 'n' Roll in Orange County: Music, Madness and Memories |first= Chris |last=Epting|publisher= The History Press |date=18 November 2014|isbn= 9781625851420 }}</ref> Later, after a member of Paramours left in 1962, Hatfield and Medley joined forces and formed a new Paramours, which included [[John Wimber|Johnny Wimber]] (a founder of the [[Vineyard Movement]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://whitedoowopcollector.blogspot.com/2008/10/the-paramoursthere-she-goes.html|title=THE PARAMOURS - There She Goes|website=Whitedoowopcleector.blogspot.com|date=October 20, 2008}}</ref> They started performing at a club called John's Black Derby in Santa Ana,<ref name="medley1"/> and were signed to a small record label [[Moonglow Records|Moonglow]] in 1962.

The Righteous Brothers released three albums under the [[Moonglow Records|Moonglow]] label,<ref name="hoffmann"/> one of these and a further compilation album were released after they had joined Phil Spector.

===1964–1965: The Spector years===
In 1964, music producer [[Phil Spector]] came across the Righteous Brothers when they performed in a show at the [[Cow Palace]] in Daly City, where one of Spector's acts, [[The Ronettes]], was also appearing, and he conducted the band for the show.<ref name="sullivan"/> Spector was impressed enough to arrange a deal with Moonglow in early October 1964 allowing him to record and release songs by the Righteous Brothers in the US, Canada and UK under his own label, [[Philles Records]].<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AtGGsfW10d0C&pg=PA171 |title=Tearing Down The Wall of Sound: The Rise And Fall of Phil Spector|author= Mick Brown |page=171 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |date=April 7, 2008|isbn=978-0747572473 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/hesrebel00mark |url-access=registration |title=He's a Rebel: Phil Spector--Rock and Roll's Legendary Producer|author= Mark Ribowsky |pages=[https://archive.org/details/hesrebel00mark/page/184 184]–185 |publisher= Cooper Square Press|date=2 May 2000 |isbn=9781461661030 }}</ref> Prior to this, all the songs Spector produced for Philles Records featured African-American singers; the Righteous Brothers would be his first white vocal group for the label. However, their "blue-eyed soul" vocal style suited Spector.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vyyVGNycEA0C&pg=PT117 |title=Phil Spector: Out Of His Head|author= Richard Williams |publisher= Omnibus Press |edition= Revised |date=November 17, 2009 |isbn=9780857120564 }}</ref>

Spector commissioned [[Barry Mann]] and [[Cynthia Weil]] to write a song for them, which turned out to be "[[You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin']]".<ref name="sullivan">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QWBPAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA102 |title=Encyclopedia of Great Popular Song Recordings, Volume 2|author=Steve Sullivan|pages=101–103 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |date=October 4, 2013 |isbn= 978-0810882959 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-gwHkKmuqDwC&pg=PA201 |title=The 100 Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Songs Ever|author= Avram Mednick |page=201 |publisher=iUniverse |date=12 June 2000|isbn= 978-0595093045 }}</ref> The song, released in late 1964, became their first major hit single and reached No. 1 in February 1965.<ref name=pc55>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19838/m1/ |title=Show 55 – Crammer: A lively cram course on the history of rock and some other things }}</ref>  [[record producer|Produced]] by [[Phil Spector]], the record is often cited as one of the finest expressions of Spector's [[Wall of Sound]] [[record production|production]] techniques. It is one of the most successful pop singles of its time, despite exceeding the then-standard length for radio play. Indeed, according to [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]], "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'" became the most-played song on American radio and television of the 20th century, with more than eight million airplays by the end of 1999.<ref name=bmi>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/232893 |title=BMI Announces Top 100 Songs of the Century |publisher=BMI |date=1999-12-13 |access-date=2013-03-27}}</ref>

The Righteous Brothers had several other hit singles with Philles Records in 1965, including "[[Just Once in My Life]]" and "[[Unchained Melody]]" (originally the B-side of "Hung on You"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1928 |title=Unchained Melody at Songfacts |publisher=Songfacts.com |access-date=2013-03-27}}</ref> both reaching the Billboard Top 10. Medley said that he produced "Unchained Melody"; the song was originally intended only as a track on the album ''[[Just Once in My Life (album)|Just Once in My Life]]'', and Spector had asked him to produce the albums so Spector could spend time and money on producing singles.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8pX_AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA35 |title=The Time of My Life: A Righteous Brother's Memoir|author= Bill Medley |publisher=Da Capo Press |date=April 24, 2014|isbn= 978-0306823169 |page=35 }}</ref><ref name="Page1">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/2014/05/06/soul-inspiration-a-conversation-with-bill-medley-of-the-righteous-brothers/| title=Soul & Inspiration: A Conversation with Bill Medley of the Righteous Brothers |last=Sharp |first=Ken |publisher=Rockcellar Magazine |access-date=8 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608031856/http://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/2014/05/06/soul-inspiration-a-conversation-with-bill-medley-of-the-righteous-brothers/#sthash.b1Vob7EZ.dpbs |archive-date=June 8, 2017 }}</ref> Later copies of the original 45 release credited Spector as producer when it became a hit.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8pX_AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA54 |title=The Time of My Life: A Righteous Brother's Memoir|author= Bill Medley |publisher=Da Capo Press |date=April 24, 2014|isbn= 978-0306823169 |page=54 }}</ref>

After the success of "Unchained Melody", Spector started releasing older songs with the Righteous Brothers, including "[[Ebb Tide (song)|Ebb Tide]]", which reached No. 5. Hatfield was the only vocal on "Unchained Melody" and "Ebb Tide", and both were songs Bobby Hatfield had performed with his first group, the Variations.<ref name="hall of fame"/> According to Medley, both the early singles "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'" and "Just Once in My Life" featured Medley's vocal strongly, which caused some friction between the duo, and the Hatfield solos in later singles restored some balance between the two.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8pX_AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA55 |title=The Time of My Life: A Righteous Brother's Memoir|author= Bill Medley |publisher=Da Capo Press |date=April 24, 2014|isbn= 978-0306823169 |page=55 }}</ref> The last single released that they recorded with Philles Records was "[[(There'll Be Bluebirds Over) The White Cliffs of Dover|The White Cliffs of Dover]]".<ref name="hall of fame">{{cite web |url=https://rockhall.com/inductees/righteous-brothers/bio/ |title=Righteous Brothers |work=Rock&Roll Hall of Fame}}</ref> Although Spector focused his attention in producing singles, a number of albums by the Righteous Brothers released with Philles Records sold well.<ref name="hoffmann"/>

In 1965, they had a couple of guest appearances in the films ''[[A Swingin' Summer]]'' and ''[[Beach Ball (film)|Beach Ball]]''. They also became the first rock and roll act to play the [[Las Vegas Strip|Strip]] in Las Vegas (at [[Sands Hotel and Casino|The Sands]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.righteousbrothers.com/interview.htm |title=The Interview (September 1996) |work=Righteousbrothers.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127100023/http://righteousbrothers.com/interview.htm |archive-date=2016-01-27}}</ref>

===1966–1967: Verve Records===
The duo's relationship with Spector however ended in some acrimony;<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/hesrebel00mark |url-access=registration |title=He's a Rebel: Phil Spector--Rock and Roll's Legendary Producer|author= Mark Ribowsky |pages=[https://archive.org/details/hesrebel00mark/page/208 208]–211 |publisher= Cooper Square Press|date=2 May 2000 |isbn=9781461661030 }}</ref> in 1966 they signed with [[Verve Records|Verve]]/[[MGM Records]], leading to a lawsuit from Spector, which MGM settled with a $600,000 payment to Spector.<ref name="ribowsky">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/hesrebel00mark |url-access=registration |title=He's a Rebel: Phil Spector--Rock and Roll's Legendary Producer|author= Mark Ribowsky |pages=[https://archive.org/details/hesrebel00mark/page/211 211]–[https://archive.org/details/hesrebel00mark/page/213 213] |publisher= Cooper Square Press|date=2 May 2000 |isbn=9781461661030 }}</ref> Their next release in 1966, "[[(You're My) Soul and Inspiration]]" was a Phil Spector sound-alike song. The song was first written by Mann and Weil after the success of "Lovin' Feelin'" but not completed, and they finished the song following a request by Medley after the Righteous Brothers moved to Verve.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-ragogna/emsoul--inspirationem-a-c_b_1658056.html |title= Soul & Inspiration: A Conversation With Songwriters Barry Mann & Cynthia Weil, Plus Milan's Calibro 35|date=July 9, 2012 |author=Mike Ragogna |work=Huffington Post }}</ref> Medley then produced the completed song, and was able to fully simulate the Spector style of production and achieve a similar sound to that of "Lovin' Feelin'". It quickly became their second No. 1 U.S. hit, staying at the top for three weeks.<ref name="ribowsky"/>

After a few more top-40 hits, including "[[He (song)|He]]" and "Go Ahead And Cry", their popularity began to decline. Even a collaboration with former [[Motown]] [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] chief [[William "Mickey" Stevenson]] failed to work. In 1967, before they went their separate ways, and, to capitalize on their previous hits, Verve/MGM issued a "Greatest Hits" compilation which has been modified twice: in 1983 with 10 tracks and in 1990 with two more tracks.

===1968–1975: Break up and reunion===
The duo split up in February 1968, a breakup that would last for more than six years, when Medley left to pursue a solo career.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wQoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA16 |title=Medley Leaves Righteous Bros |journal=Billboard |date= February 24, 1968 }}</ref> Medley recorded a few solo recordings on several labels, while Hatfield teamed up with singer Jimmy Walker (from [[The Knickerbockers]]) using the Righteous Brothers name on the MGM label. Medley first recorded "I Can't Make It Alone" written by [[Carole King]], but the song failed to make much of an impact. The following single, "Brown Eyed Woman" written by Mann and Weil, performed better.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8pX_AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA74 |title=The Time of My Life: A Righteous Brother's Memoir|author= Bill Medley |publisher=Da Capo Press |date=April 24, 2014|isbn= 978-0306823169 |page=74 }}</ref> However, neither he nor Hatfield was able to match their previous chart success.

Hatfield and Jimmy Walker recorded an album, ''Re-Birth'', as "The Righteous Brothers" before disbanding in 1971.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QVt7_WQtqeoC&pg=PA67 |title=Haunted Las Vegas: Famous Phantoms, Creepy Casinos, and Gambling Ghosts |page=67 |publisher= Globe Pequot Press|year= 2012|isbn=9780762789108 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://thriftyvinyl.wordpress.com/2013/01/31/the-righteous-brothers-re-birth-svlp-9249-1969/ |title=The Righteous Brothers – Re-Birth (SVLP 9249) (1969) |work=Thrifty Vinyl }}</ref> In a 2013 interview, Jimmy Walker said he had wanted to continue, but Hatfield decided to take a break and broke up the act.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://somethingelsereviews.com/2013/03/02/something-else-interview-jimmy-walker-of-the-knickerbockers-and-the-righteous-brothers/ |date=March 2, 2013|author= Katy Levy |title=Something Else! Interview: Jimmy Walker of the Knickerbockers and the Righteous Brothers |work=Something Else}}</ref> In 1969, Hatfield appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Ballad of Andy Crocker]]'', and also recorded "[[Only You (And You Alone)|Only You]]". He released a solo album, ''Messin' In Muscle Shoals'' in 1971.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Bobby-Hatfield-Messin-In-Muscle-Shoals/release/2584349 |title=Bobby Hatfield – Messin' In Muscle Shoals  |work=Discogs }}</ref>

According to Medley, he was performing three shows a night in Las Vegas, but finding it too much of a strain on his voice singing solo, and under advice he sought out Hatfield to reform The Righteous Brothers; Hatfield at this point was broke and living alone in a small apartment.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8pX_AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA101 |title=The Time of My Life: A Righteous Brother's Memoir|author= Bill Medley |publisher=Da Capo Press |date=April 24, 2014|isbn= 978-0306823169 |pages=101–102 }}</ref> In 1974, Medley and Hatfield announced their reunion at an appearance on ''[[The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour]]''.<ref name="hoffmann">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wNfx07-AJwcC&pg=PA225 |title=Rhythm and Blues, Rap, and Hip-hop|author= Frank Hoffmann |year=2005|pages=225–226|publisher=Facts on File |isbn=9780816069804 }}</ref> They signed with Haven Records, run by producers [[Dennis Lambert]] and [[Brian Potter (musician)|Brian Potter]] and distributed by [[Capitol Records]]. Within a few weeks of reforming, they recorded [[Alan O'Day]]'s "[[Rock and Roll Heaven]]", a paean to several deceased [[Rock and roll|rock]] singers which became a hit, peaking at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100. Several more minor hits on Haven followed. After 1975, however, the Righteous Brothers would not appear in music charts except for re-releases of older songs and compilation albums, some of which were re-recordings of earlier works.

===1976–2003: Later career and solo works===
Between 1976 and 1981, Hatfield and Medley stopped performing as a duo after the death of Medley's first wife, as he wanted time off to look after his son. They reunited for an anniversary special on ''[[American Bandstand]]'' in 1981 to perform an updated version of "Rock And Roll Heaven".<ref name="hoffmann"/><ref name=spctropop /> They resumed touring intermittently, and they recorded a 21st Anniversary Celebration concert in 1983 at the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy]] on the [[Sunset Strip]] in Los Angeles, which was later released on video and was also aired on television.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/previews/newsletter/archives/20080601.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-07-11 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616045430/http://www.pbs.org/previews/newsletter/archives/20080601.html |archive-date=16 June 2008}}</ref>

In the late 1970s, Medley once again began to record as a solo artist and had some success in the 1980s. In 1984, he scored country hits with "Till Your Memory's Gone" and "[[I Still Do (song)|I Still Do]]", the latter also an adult-contemporary crossover hit. In late 1987, his duet with [[Jennifer Warnes]], "[[(I've Had) The Time of My Life]]", which appeared on the soundtrack for ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'', topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It won them a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]].

In 1990, Bobby Hatfield's original recording of "Unchained Melody" was featured in the popular feature film ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', starring [[Patrick Swayze]] and [[Demi Moore]]. It triggered an avalanche of requests to Top 40 radio stations by fans who had seen the movie to play the 1965 Righteous Brothers' recording. This motivated [[PolyGram|Polygram]] (which now owned the Verve/MGM label archives) to re-release the song to Top 40 radio. It became a major hit for a second time, reaching No. 13 on the Hot 100 in 1990. It also became their second No. 1 in the UK. The duo quickly re-recorded another version of "Unchained Melody" for [[Curb Records]]. Both the reissued and the re-recorded songs charted at the same time for several weeks, and the Righteous Brothers made history as the first act to have two versions of the same song in the Top 20 at the same time.<ref name=spctropop>{{cite web |url=http://www.spectropop.com/remembers/BHobit.htm |title=BOBBY HATFIELD (1940 - 2003) Blue-eyed Soul Brother |author=Peter Richmond |work=Spectropop }}</ref> The re-recorded "Unchained Melody" hit No. 19 on the Hot 100 and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).{{Certification Cite Ref|region=United States|type=single|title=Unchained Melody|artist=Righteous Brothers}}

They also re-recorded other songs for a budget-priced CD, ''The Best of The Righteous Brothers'', released by Curb Records. Medley would later describe the re-recordings as "artistically, a stupid idea; financially, a wonderfully idea".<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8pX_AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA141 |title=The Time of My Life: A Righteous Brother's Memoir|author= Bill Medley |publisher=Da Capo Press |date=April 24, 2014|isbn= 978-0306823169 |page=141 }}</ref> The album sold very well and received a double platinum certification from the RIAA.{{Certification Cite Ref|region=United States|type=album|title=Unchained Melody – Best Of The Righteous Brothers|artist=Righteous Brothers}} A [[greatest hits]] CD collection of the original recordings called ''The Very Best of The Righteous Brothers...Unchained Melody''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000001FZC/ |title=The Very Best of The Righteous Brothers...Unchained Melody |access-date=2013-03-27}}</ref> was released later by Verve/[[Polydor Records|Polydor]].

==Hatfield's death==
[[Bobby Hatfield]] was found dead in his hotel room in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]], on November 5, 2003, shortly before he was due to perform at a concert with Bill Medley at [[Western Michigan University]]'s [[Miller Auditorium]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/68317/righteous-brother-bobby-hatfield-dies |title=Righteous Brother Bobby Hatfield Dies|date= November 6, 2003 |work=Billboard}}</ref> The autopsy report attributed his death to heart failure brought on by cocaine.<ref name="nytimes">{{cite news |last=Strauss |first=Neil |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE1DF1131F93BA35752C0A9629C8B63 |title=The Pop Life; Drugs, Demons: A Man In a Mask |date=January 8, 2004 |access-date=September 18, 2007 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> Bill Medley continued to perform as a solo artist for some time after Hatfield's death, occasionally singing with a screen projection of old film footage of Hatfield.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3u7iBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA285 |title= Encyclopedia of Pop Music Aliases, 1950–2000|author= Bob Leszczak |page=285 |publisher= Rowman & Littlefield Publishers |date=December 11, 2014 |isbn=9781442240087 }}</ref>

==2016: The Righteous Brothers revived==
In January 2016, Medley announced he intended to revive the Righteous Brothers for the first time since 2003. The late Hatfield was replaced with singer Bucky Heard at Las Vegas's [[Harrah's Metropolis|Harrah's Showroom]] for more than 40 shows from March 23, 2016 to November 8.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://kwbe.com/abc_classicr/bill-medley-reforms-the-righteous-brothers-with-new-duet-partner-for-las-vegas-residency-abcid35603286/ |title=Bill Medley Reforms The Righteous Brothers with New Duet Partner for Las Vegas Residency |date=February 5, 2016 |work=ABC News Radio |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222074016/http://kwbe.com/abc_classicr/bill-medley-reforms-the-righteous-brothers-with-new-duet-partner-for-las-vegas-residency-abcid35603286/ |archive-date=February 22, 2016}}</ref> The repertoire included some of the Righteous Brothers' best-known songs, such as "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'," "Soul & Inspiration," "Unchained Melody", but also the later "Rock and Roll Heaven", as well as Bill Medley's "The Time of My Life".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.casinocitytimes.com/news/article/the-righteous-brothers-to-perform-at-harrahs-las-vegas-starting-march-23-216440|title=The Righteous Brothers to perform at Harrah's Las Vegas starting March 23|website=www.casinocitytimes.com}}</ref> Medley explained that it was the encouragement of the Righteous Brothers’ fans as well as several friends, producers and contacts in Las Vegas that made him consider reviving the Righteous Brothers' name again, while acknowledging that it was a difficult choice to continue without Hatfield, saying “I’ve had a million fans hollering at me to keep the Righteous Brothers alive... I looked at a couple of guys, but you know, you can’t replace Bobby Hatfield, he’s the best in the world”. Medley was previously acquainted with Heard and watched him perform at a tribute concert to [[Journey (band)|Journey]], after which he realized that Heard was the only one he would consider capable of filling Hatfield's shoes, also noting that he and Heard had good chemistry together. Medley approached Heard a few days later and discussed the matter, which ended in a coin toss, which Medley won, resulting in Heard accepting Medley's proposal. Heard has since communicated that he knows he can never replace Hatfield, nor will he attempt to do so and that he intends to sing like Hatfield rather than sound like him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bransontrilakesnews.com/news_free/article_c0300126-8d82-11e5-8c47-8b5319049d92.html|title='Lovin' Feeling' no longer lost|first=Joshua|last=Clark}}</ref> A new CD was released the same year, featuring several of the Righteous Brothers' hit singles sung by Medley and Heard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://righteousbrothers.com/righteous-brothers-audio-cd/|title=The Righteous Brothers Audio CD – Righteous Brothers|website=righteousbrothers.com}}</ref>

The Righteous Brothers were nominated twice for a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]. In 1965, their recording of "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'" was nominated in the Best Rock And Roll Recording category at the [[7th Annual Grammy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.awardsandshows.com/features/grammy-awards-1965-217.html |title=Grammy Awards 1965 |work=Awards & Shows }}</ref> Their re-recording of "Unchained Melody" was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group at the [[33rd Annual Grammy Awards|1991 Grammy]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KA8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA71 |title=Hatfield dies at 63 |journal=Billboard |date=November 15, 2003 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1991/grammys.htm |title=33rd Grammy Awards – 1991 |work=Rock on the Net }}</ref> They were also awarded the Best New Singing Group in the Billboard Disc Jockey Poll in 1965.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZykEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA39 |title=Billboard |date=April 3, 1965 |page=39 }}</ref>

;Notes
{{refbegin}}
*'''note a'''{{Note|note_a1}}"My Babe" re-charted in 1965 at No. 101 U.S.
*'''note b'''{{Note|note_a2}}"Bring Your Love to Me"/"Fannie Mae," "You Can Have Her," "Justine" and "Georgia on My Mind" were older recordings released as singles in the U.S. by the Moonglow label to cash in on the duo's success on Philles (1964–65) and Verve (1966–67), which explains their relatively low chart positions.
*'''note c'''{{Note|note_a3}}The 1990 re-issue of "Unchained Melody" also charted at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary chart.
*'''note d'''{{Note|note_d4}} Three versions were ranked together as one in the [[Dutch Top 40]] chart – the versions by the Righteous Brothers, Cilla Black, and a local cover by [[:nl: Trea Dobbs|Trea Dobbs]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.top40.nl/top40/1965/week-12 |title=week 12 (20 maart 1965) |work=Media Markt 100 }}</ref>
