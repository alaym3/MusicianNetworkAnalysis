'''TISM''' (an acronym of '''This Is Serious Mum''') were<!-- "were" is correct Australian English. Please do NOT change to "was" --> a seven-piece [[Anonymity|anonymous]] [[alternative rock]] band from [[Melbourne]], Australia. The group was formed on 30 December 1982 by vocalist/drummer Humphrey B. Flaubert, bassist/vocalist Jock Cheese and keyboardist/vocalist Eugene de la Hot Croix Bun, and enjoyed a large [[Underground music|underground]]/[[independent music|independent]] following. Their third album, ''[[Machiavelli and the Four Seasons]]'', reached the Australian national top 10 in 1995.

==History==
===1982-1991: Early years, ''Great Truckin' Songs of the Renaissance'' & ''Hot Dogma''===
In 1982, [[Damian Cowell]] ("Humphrey B. Flaubert" – drums and lead vocals), Jack Holt ("Jock Cheese" – guitar, bass and backing vocals) and Eugene Cester ("Eugene de la Hot Croix Bun" – keyboards and backing vocals), recorded a nine-song session called ''Great Truckin' Songs of the Renaissance'' under the name '''This Is Serious Mum''' at the home of friend [[Peter Minack]] ("Ron Hitler-Barassi"). Cowell and Cester were members of a group called I Can Run, which slowly evolved into This Is Serious Mum.

The band's first concert was on 6 December 1983. ''The Get Fucked Concert'' at the Duncan McKinnon Athletics Reserve in the small suburb of [[Murrumbeena, Victoria|Murrumbeena]] was considered a complete failure which caused the band to split up. They reformed in February 1984 and returned to their recordings, experimenting with [[dark ambient]] and [[industrial music]], before returning to their rock style. They consider every subsequent performance a "re-union [[Gig (musical performance)|gig]]".<ref name="tismhistory">[https://web.archive.org/web/20001206202000/http://www.tism.com.au/history/ TISM – The History of This Is Serious Mum] (2000).

On 25 November 1984, the band made their public debut at the [[University of Melbourne]], at which they released a self-titled demo tape recorded earlier that year at the home studio of [[Serious Young Insects]] drummer Mark White. Only eleven copies were made available at the show, and all had sold by the time the group finished their short set.

By 1985 the band were playing regularly around Melbourne and released their début single, "[[Defecate on My Face]]" in 1986, a 7" [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]] packaged in a 12" sleeve with all four sides glued shut. This song is also found (but is unlisted) on the EP ''Form and Meaning Reach Ultimate Communion'' as a country version. Their next single, "[[40 Years – Then Death]]", was released in 1987 on transparent vinyl in a clear plastic sleeve with no cover art or labels. TISM's first radio-friendly single, despite the obscure packaging, was received well.<ref name="tismhistory"/>

The début album, ''[[Great Truckin' Songs of the Renaissance]]'' was released in 1988 as a double vinyl release in an embossed gatefold sleeve. The first record contained twelve of TISM's most popular tracks, and the second was a pastiche of interviews, bedroom recordings and live diatribes. Despite this odd combination, ''Truckin' Songs'' entered the lower reaches of Australia's mainstream Top 50, as did the single "[[Saturday Night Palsy]]".<ref name="tismhistory"/>

Later that year, ''The TISM Guide To Little Aesthetics'', a book compiling lyrics, interviews and press releases, was published, but could not be released until early 1990, as TISM, having threatened with legal action for libel, were asked to hand-censor the book with a mixture of white-out and permanent marker, as well as place "CENSORED DUE TO LEGAL ADVICE" stickers on each copy of the book. Despite this, some uncensored copies exist, and a document with the censored content is available.

In 1990, TISM entered negotiations with [[CBS Records International|CBS Records]] and [[Phonogram Records]] and were signed by the latter. In April that year, the band began work on what would become their next album with producer Laurence Maddy. When Phonogram released ''[[Hot Dogma]]'' in 1990, it failed to reach the commercial charts, and TISM were fired six months later due to management issues, despite owing the label tens of thousands of dollars.<ref name="tismhistory"/> ''Hot Dogma'' is the first release to use the acronymic form of the band's name exclusively.

Over two nights in May 1991, the band were filmed live and released the video ''Incontinent in Ten Continents''. These performances were the last for guitarist Leek Van Vlalen.<ref name="tism-tourdates">[https://web.archive.org/web/20040923022202/http://www.tism.com.au/tourdates/ This Is Serious Mum live dates: 1991] (list) (2004).

In mid-1991, TISM signed with independent record label [[Shock Records]] and re-issued ''Great Truckin' Songs of the Renaissance'', as well as the [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Gentlemen, Start Your Egos]]'' 1991; a compilation of tracks previously unavailable on CD.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060205122123/http://shock.com.au/artists/releases.asp?artist_ID=56389 Shock Records – T.I.S.M] – Official page at the Shock Records website.

A new guitarist, Tony Coitus (later Tokin' Blackman) joined the group onstage for the first time on 23 January 1992.<ref name="tism-tourdates"/>

The 1993 EP, ''[[Australia The Lucky Cunt]]'' was the group's most controversial release to date. Courts issued an [[Injunction|injunction order]] of the CD when the [[Ken Done]] Society threatened legal action over the artwork,<ref name="tismhistory"/> which parodied Done's signature style and depicted a [[koala]] sucking a syringe.

TISM's biggest success was the 1995 album ''[[Machiavelli and the Four Seasons]]''. The release was a shift from [[Alternative rock|alternative-rock]] to [[Synthesizer|synth]]-driven [[techno]] and [[dance music|dance]] which retained vocal [[melody|melodies]] and loud [[guitar]]s. The album was certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] and won the [[ARIA Award for Best Independent Release]].<ref name="tismhistory"/> Three of its singles reached [[Triple J Hottest 100|Triple J's Hottest 100]], two of them in the top 10 in 1995.<ref>[[Triple J]] (1995).

A four CD [[box set]] of early albums was released and steady record sales allowed extensive tours of Australia and New Zealand.

In 1996 TISM toured on the [[Big Day Out]], during which Ron Hitler-Barassi was either absent or wheelchair-bound due to a [[Retinal detachment|detached retina]] and broken arm caused by a stage dive he performed at the Pacific Hotel, Lorne, Victoria prior to the tour.<ref name="aust-travel">Flaubert, Humphrey B.

Taking a year off from touring, TISM spent 1997 working on their next album with producer [[Magoo (Australian producer)|Lachlan Magoo]]. The album, ''[[www.tism.wanker.com]]'' was released in 1998.

''www.tism.wanker.com'' sold well, thanks in part to an extensive Australian tour with [[Regurgitator]], then at the height of their popularity, and [[The Fauves]]; however, sales were low compared to ''Machiavelli and the Four Seasons'''s success and TISM's contract with Shock ended by mutual agreement.

===1999-2002: Festival Records & ''De RigueurMortis''===
Following the 1998 tour, TISM signed with [[Festival Records (Australia)|Festival Mushroom Records]], which re-released their entire back catalogue (except for ''Hot Dogma'', their previous singles and the bonus discs for ''Machiavelli'' and ''wanker.com'') on CD.

In early 2002, the track "[[Honk If You Love Fred Durst]]" was released as a single. In 2002, Festival Mushroom Records released ''[[tism.bestoff.]]'', a [[best of]] compilation which included their greatest hits, two new tracks and a disc of remastered Bedroom Recordings. The compilation was their third, and last, release with Festival Mushroom Records, as TISM's contract had ended.

===2003-2005: ''The White Albun'' and break up===
Finding themselves with no record label again, TISM returned to touring. In late 2003, a special one-off concert was filmed and released on DVD as ''[[The White Albun]]'' in 2004 by [[Madman Entertainment]]. A documentary and full length album were also included, making it a 3-disc set which received good reviews;<ref>Anton (30 June 2004).

At the band's penultimate concert on 13 November 2004, Ron Hitler-Barassi delivered a diatribe saying that the band had "lost the election" and made references to [[Guy Sebastian]] winning the year's season of ''[[Australian Idol]]''. This opening remark can be interpreted as the band announcing their breakup.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emXRiI98K7A&list=PLC79776FF6D9A4137&index=2|title=RHB HIFI 13-11-2004.wmv|last=Peter Aylward|date=22 December 2009|access-date=5 August 2016|via=YouTube|archive-date=28 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160628113357/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emXRiI98K7A&list=PLC79776FF6D9A4137&index=2|url-status=live}}</ref> The opening remark about losing the election later became the title of a live album. For all appearances, it had appeared that TISM had split, with no announcement or fanfare.

In 2005, TISM released the German CD-single "[[Everyone Else Has Had More Sex Than Me]]". [[Sony]]/[[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] Germany expressed interest when the song's animated clip was an [[viral video|Internet hit]] thanks to [[blog]]gers and sites such as [[YouTube]].

In October 2009, the majority of TISM's back catalogue was re-released on [[iTunes]] with bonus material.

In March 2010, a "21st century mix" of their single "[[Shut Up – The Footy's on the Radio]]" was released on iTunes. The 21st century mix features Humphrey B. Flaubert on vocals and Jock Cheese on guitars, and had wholly new lyrics.

===Identities===
TISM have never officially revealed their names, instead choosing to use pseudonyms on their records and in interviews, all the while concealing their faces. Usually this involves the wearing of a [[balaclava (clothing)|balaclava]], but outrageous costumes have been created for the purpose, including [[Ku Klux Klan]] uniforms made of [[newspaper]],<ref name="costumes">The White Albun (2004) [DVD].

Who TISM are beneath the masks has been the cause of much speculation by fans, with one theory contending that TISM is composed of members of other bands who do not want their fans to find out: popular targets of this theory include [[Painters and Dockers]], [[Machine Gun Fellatio]] and even [[The Wiggles]].<ref>Jenkins, Jeff (8 July 1998).

When asked why they wear masks, Flaubert replied:
{{Quotation|The answer that makes me sound good is that we desired to circumvent the cult of personality that is inherent in rock music by choosing to remain anonymous. Unlike every other band in rock we chose to be anonymous. The answer that makes me sound good would probably also incorporate some lengthy discussion about [[Bertolt Brecht|Brechtian]] [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] techniques, about our [[Postmodern philosophy|post modernist]] grasp of ever cooling universe, and a dehumanising society encapsulated in the somewhat paramilitary aspect of our clothing.

==Style==
TISM were distinguished from other 'joke' or 'gimmick bands', by, among other things, their musical style. The band rarely in any seriousness stated actual influences on the type of music they played, except that [[The Residents]] were a band which TISM 'did' notice and 'possibly' took some influence from.<ref name="tismpdf"/> A clear link can be drawn from The Residents' ''[[The Third Reich 'n' Roll]]'' video, in which that band wore [[Ku Klux Klan]] uniforms made of newspaper:<ref>Sokal, Roman (2001) [http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/timeline.aspx?csid1=22 The Residents: More Than What The Ear Hears Coming From The Eye] Roman Sokal (''essay'') Retrieved 10 December 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418155803/http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/timeline.aspx?csid1=22 |date=18 April 2009 }}</ref> TISM did exactly this at their first gig. Another link may be drawn to early TISM tracks "The Ballad of the Semitic Nazi" or "I'm Gonna Treat Ya to a Neitschze Double Feature" ''(sic)'' which use a similar naming convention to The Residents. Other bands which may have influenced TISM are difficult to pinpoint, although a ''Sydney Morning Herald'' article on the band described them as "a cross between [[Skyhooks (band)|Skyhooks]], [[Dave Warner (musician)|Dave Warner]], [[Talking Heads]] and The Residents".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://tismarchive.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/1986-07-20-smh.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=23 February 2016 |archive-date=12 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312154015/https://tismarchive.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/1986-07-20-smh.jpg |url-status=live }}</ref>

The band were criticised as unoriginal for continually opting for standard pop song structures. One reason for this is clarified in their book, ''The TISM Guide To Little Aesthetics'', in the following paragraphs, when asked why their ideas are post-modern but their music is not:

<blockquote>
"Give me a pop-song, mate. Give me a fucking pop-song. Not only is it more fun, it's pretty fuckin' hard to write as well. You can bung in as many out-of-tune oboes as you want, but putting chords together so they sound pleasant isn't as simple as it might appear. It mightn't be the [[Sistine Chapel]], but what is? [[Ollie Olsen|Ollie fucking Olsen]] with his stupid feedback and cough mixture? [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]], with their stupid feedback, and their stupid stage show with 800 powerful stupid lights and enough stupid dry ice to enhance their stupid stupidity up its own bullshit crappy teenage pretentious one dimensional dick witted puissant artistic enigma?

So ... what have you listened to for a good time that isn't, after all, a 'traditional' song? Still playing the [[Mike Oldfield]] records, huh? Still whipping ''[[Yessongs]]'' on for a good time? Wanna count on one hand how many people have fun at a [[Sonic Youth]] gig? I'm not supporting [[The Choirboys (band)|The Choirboys]], old man, I'm just saying that the day some jumped-up over-paid self-important post-modernist cocksucker puts his foot upon his [[Fairlight CMI|Fairlight]] computer in the middle of his 47-minute opus "The Silent Forgiveness of the Pig-God" and belts out the chords to "[[Johnny B. Goode]]" is the day I'll join you at the footlights of post-modernism.

Besides which, pop songs sell more."<ref>sephira (14 September 2003) "[http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1492226 The TISM Guide to Little Aesthetics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929141447/http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1492226 |date=29 September 2007 }}" at [[Everything2]].

TISM's keyboard sound was provided by an [[Optigan]] which keyboardist Eugene Cester ran through a [[flanger]].{{Citation needed|reason=I never saw them use a Optigan in televised performances, nor do their keyboards ever sound like they were generated by an Optigan. Sorry.|date=April 2017}} They mainly used [[standard tuning]]; however, [[Eb tuning]] and [[drop D]] were employed in some songs. Jock Cheese's bass was prominent in the songs to a degree that head of Festival Mushroom Records, Michael Parisi, described the sound as "aggressive".<ref>The liner notes to the Best Off bonus disc</ref>
