The duo released its debut album ''The Juice Vol. I'' to critical acclaim in May, which dives into the complexities of the male vs. female relationship<ref name="billboard.com"/> through blunt lyricism and honeyed, late-'90s-inspired production. The drop created almost instant buzz, with fans flocking to the duo's sold-out shows<ref>{{Cite web|title=You are being redirected...|url=https://theknockturnal.com/rb-group-emotional-oranges-bring-all-the-feels-to-nyc/|access-date=2020-08-04|website=theknockturnal.com}}</ref> and social media direct messages.

Emotional Oranges have managed to keep their identities secret, while building hype around a handful of singles, all of which were released over the course of the last year or so. Despite their anonymity, they communicate with fans directly every day, most often via Instagram message, carrying engaging dialogue with the "citrus squad," as they refer to their followers.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-11-13|title=Emotional Oranges Sing Tales Of Modern Love Behind Mysterious Blinds|url=https://www.vibe.com/2019/11/emotional-oranges-next-vibe-feature|access-date=2020-08-04|website=Vibe|language=en}}</ref>
