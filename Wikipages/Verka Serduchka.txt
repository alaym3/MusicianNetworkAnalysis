As a [[character actor]], Danylko has also appeared in over a dozen television films and is also known for his cameo in the 2015 American comedy film ''[[Spy (2015 film)|Spy]]''.

==Early life and education==
Andriy Danylko was born to a working-class family in [[Poltava]]. His mother, Svitlana Volkova, came from the noble Khomentovsky family, a friend of whose family was a famous Ukrainian artist [[Ilya Repin]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=tv.ua|date=2012-12-27|title=Андрей Данилко ищет свои дворянские корни (ФОТО)|url=https://tv.ua/news/881152-andrejj-danilko-ishhet-svoi-dvoryanskie-korni-foto|access-date=2021-05-26|website=tv.ua|language=ru}}</ref> In 1980, at seven, he lost his father to lung cancer. 

Since childhood, Danilko showed talents in drawing and music: in 1984 he entered art school.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-10-02|title=Андрей Данилко именинник: украинскому артисту 44|url=https://joinfo.com/showbiz/1216687_Andrey-Danilko-imeninnik-ukrainskomu-artistu-44.html|access-date=2021-05-26|website=Joinfo Новости|language=ru}}</ref> The talents of the future artist were early manifested in other areas as well: Andriy was the captain of the [[KVN]] school team, played as a schoolboy for the CPTU № 30 team, and also performed annually on the stage in the summer children's camp. In addition, at school Andrew became interested in theater, in the seventh grade he entered the local theater studio, was engaged in the theater studio "Grotesque", and was part of the theater group "Compote".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Мама Андрея Данилко: «Когда сын начинал карьеру, я могла помочь ему разве что… старой юбкой, в которой он вышел на сцену в образе Сердючки"|url=https://showbiz.fakty.ua/170476-mama-andreya-danilko-kogda-syn-nachinal-kareru-ya-mogla-pomoch-emu-razve-chto-staroj-yubkoj-v-kotoroj-on-vyshel-na-scenu-v-obraze-serdyuchki|access-date=2021-05-26|website=showbiz.fakty.ua|language=uk}}</ref> In 1991, he graduated from Poltava Secondary School № 27. An avid amateur performer since childhood, he graduated from the [[Kyiv Municipal Academy of Variety and Circus Arts|Kyiv State College of Circus and Variety Arts]].

==Career==

===Early career===
In 1990, Andriy Danylko began to create the character of Verka Serduchka, a flamboyant middle-aged woman from a rural family, working as a railroad [[sleeping car]] attendant. Danylko presented Serduchka publicly for the first time in a [[Poltava]] comedy competition on 4 January 1991. He invented the character's name by combining the randomly picked first name Verka and the last name of a former school classmate, Anna Serduk.<ref name="why_serduk">{{cite web|url=http://www.kp.ru/daily/23171/25154/|title=Danylko become Serduchka because of school girlfriend|publisher=kp.ru|date=4 December 2003|language=ru}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marusia.ru/show2000/12-02.html|title=Interview with Verka Serduchka-Danylko|first=Elena|last=Ryzancheva|language=ru}}</ref> Danylko later gave his Serduchka character a "mother," played by actress Inna Bilokon, who had been Danylko's close friend since school.

After Verka Serduchka, Danylko created other characters, such as a [[militsiya|police officer]], a soldier and a female ballet dancer. He established the troupe "Danylko Theater" to tour the cities of Russia and Ukraine. In 2002, Danylko, along with his group, toured in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] and Baltic countries with the program "I am a Revolution" for the whole year. The following year he was awarded the title of [[Honored Artist of Ukraine]] soon after the Danylko Theater concert tour "I Was Born for Love".

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Danylko hosted a talk show called "SV-show" ("SV" is an abbreviation for {{lang-uk|Спальний Вагон, "Spalnyy Vagon"}}, which means ''[[sleeping car]]'') on various Ukrainian television channels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liveinternet.ru/users/serduchka/|title=Danylko's biography|language=ru}}</ref> In 2001, Danylko made his first appearance in one of several musicals produced for television, mostly in female comic portrayals based on the Serduchka character (see Filmography). Several of these productions were shown in the New Year's Eve broadcasts of [[Russia-1]] television.

Apart from pop and dance performances as Serduchka, Danylko has also performed [[Ambient music|ambient]] musical compositions under his real name, including the 2005 album После тебя (''Posle tebya'': ''After you'').

===Eurovision Song Contest 2007===

Verka Serduchka was chosen to [[Ukraine in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007|represent Ukraine]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007]] in Helsinki, [[Finland]], with the song "[[Dancing Lasha Tumbai]]".<ref name="podrobnosti">{{cite web|url=http://www.podrobnosti.ua/culture/music/2007/03/10/404185.html |title=Verka Serduchka went to the Eurovision-2007 song contest |access-date=17 March 2007 |work=Podrobnosti.ua |language=ru }}</ref> One of Ukraine's nationwide FM radio stations organized a protest action in February 2007 to express their disapproval of the selection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntn.tv/news/ukraine/07/02/23/10/53.html |title="No to Euroserduchka!" – protest action of an FM radio station|access-date=10 May 2007 |publisher=[[NTN (Channel)|NTN]] |language=uk}}</ref> Some Ukrainians and even members of the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian Parliament]] also expressed their disapproval, viewing the character of Serduchka as "grotesque and vulgar".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6516927.stm |title=Eurovision act angers Ukrainians |access-date=11 May 2007 |publisher=BBC News | date=2 April 2007 |first=Helen |last=Fawkes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ua.korrespondent.net/main/68684 |title=Eurovision: Verka Serduchka will disgrace Ukraine |access-date=11 May 2007 |publisher=[[Korrespondent]] |language=uk |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070320045842/http://ua.korrespondent.net/main/68684 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 20 March 2007}}</ref>

Serduchka's song "Dancing Lasha Tumbai" was sung in two languages: German and English. The invented words "lasha tumbai" caused some controversy after the performance, as many people noted the phrase's similarity to "Russia goodbye". In early publicity appearances, Serduchka explained that "lasha tumbai" was a [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] expression for "whipped cream." His statement was denied by several Mongols who gave the correct phrase on a talk show broadcast by [[Channel One (Russia)]] just before the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gpu-ua.info/index.php?&id=162058 |title=Russian Channel One Takes Offence at Verka Serduchka |access-date=21 May 2007 |work=Ukrainian Newspaper |language=uk}}</ref> The Mongolian embassy in Moscow also said that "lasha tumbai" was total [[gibberish]].<ref>{{cite web

In the final, "Dancing Lasha Tumbai" came in second with 235 points. The "Dancing Lasha Tumbai" single reached No. 6 in the French charts and went on to be No. 28 on [[The Official UK Singles Chart]] on 20 May 2007. This was the first time a non-UK, non-winning Eurovision entry had made UK charts since 1974.

Danylko later made a brief phone-in appearance on the [[BBC]]'s ''[[The Graham Norton Show]],'' in which his comments made no sense whatsoever. Another call was made, but with a translator in the audience. In this instance, Danylko appeared to tell guest [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] he was "rubbish". However, in an interview with Andrew Williams in the 60 Seconds column of metro.co.uk (30 July 2007), Danylko clarified his meaning:

{{quote|AW: Why did you call Andrew Lloyd Webber ‘rubbish’ on The Graham Norton Show?

AD: Someone interpreted Serduchka wrongly. I meant I watched "Cats: the Musical" on TV. It was boring. You should watch a musical on the stage. Don't watch "Cats" on TV.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/fame/interviews/article.html?in_article_id=59149&in_page_id=11|title=60 SECONDS: Verka Serduchka|work=Metro|location=UK}}</ref>}}

In the same interview, he stated that "lasha tumbai" was a somewhat made-up phrase that sounds like the Mongolian phrase for "milkshake" and that many Russians nevertheless managed to interpret it as saying "Russia goodbye!".{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In 2011, a writer from British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' described "Dancing Lasha Tumbai" as the "best song never to win Eurovision" before going on to describe Serduchka as "an oven-ready [[Christopher Biggins]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/may/10/six-to-watch-eurovision-song-contest |title=Six to watch: memorable Eurovision moments |work=The Guardian | location=London |first=Julia |last=Raeside |date=10 May 2011}}</ref>

===Later career===
Danylko announced in 2007 that he would front a new political party, "For Ours!", to run in that year's [[2007 Ukrainian parliamentary election|Ukrainian parliamentary election]], but he later abandoned the idea.  A public opinion poll in July 2007 placed "For Ours! Verka Serduchka" at 2% overall support.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pravda.com.ua/en/news/2007/7/31/8463.htm|title=Socialists Lose Their Rating|date=31 July 2007|work=[[Ukrayinska Pravda]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.russiatoday.ru/news/news/13012|title=Ukraine's election campaign: mired in scandal|date=25 August 2007|publisher=[[RT (TV network)|RT]]}}</ref>

Serduchka had planned to participate in the [[Ukraine in the Eurovision Song Contest 2011|Ukrainian national selection]] for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011]].

In the scene, set in Paris, Serduchka's open-air performance of "[[Dancing Lasha Tumbai]]" is interrupted by CIA agents Susan Cooper ([[Melissa McCarthy]]) and Rick Ford ([[Jason Statham]]).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://esctoday.com/81752/ukraine-verka-hits-hollywood-spy-movie/ |title=Ukraine: Verka hits Hollywood in spy movie |publisher=esctoday.com |first=Pete |last=Lewis |date=27 April 2014}}</ref>
