'''''VeggieTales''''' is an American [[Christian film industry|Christian]] [[computer animation|computer generated]] musical children's animation and [[Christian media]] [[Multimedia franchise|franchise]] created by [[Phil Vischer]] and [[Mike Nawrocki]] under [[Big Idea Entertainment]]. The series sees fruit and vegetable characters retelling Christian stories from the Bible, with episodes presenting life lessons according to a biblical worldview.

The franchise originated as a video series, with episodes distributed primarily direct to home media, first in 1993 on VHS, and later on DVD and Blu-ray through to 2015. The television series ''VeggieTales on TV!'' ran on [[NBC]] from 2006 to 2009, and two Netflix series debuted in 2014 and 2017. Two films were released: ''[[Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie]]'' (2008). The success of the animations helped establish a franchise of related media, including music, stage productions, and video games.

The series is distinguished as the most successful Christian children's franchise of all time; in 1999 and 2000, at the height of its popularity, the videos outsold every other kids' property at the time. It has sold over 16 million books, 7 million music CDs, and 235 million [[streaming media|music streams]].

==History==
''VeggieTales'' was created by Phil Vischer and Mike Nawrocki through the production company [[Big Idea Entertainment]] with an overall aim to convey Christian moral themes and teach Biblical values and lessons for a child-based audience. Vischer developed the idea for ''VeggieTales'' in the early 1990s while testing animation software as a medium for children's videos.<ref name="MeMyselfBob" /> Due to limitations in the [[Softimage 3D|Softimage Creative Environment]] at the time, Vischer opted to avoid the technical production hurdle of designing characters with arms, legs, hair, and clothes. The first animation model for ''VeggieTales'' was an anthropomorphic candy bar. Further inspiration derived from Vischer's wife who suggested parents of the target audience might prefer a hero protagonist who promoted [[healthy diet|healthier eating habit]]s. Vischer then began to design the characters based on fruits and vegetables.

Vischer then recruited his friends to voice the cast of ''VeggieTales'' in the early episodes. Dan Anderson ([[List of VeggieTales characters#Mike and Lisa Asparagus|Dad Asparagus]]) and Jim Poole ([[List of VeggieTales characters#Scooter Carrot|Scooter the Carrot]]) who collaborated with Vischer on dramas at their local church, were recruited for the cast.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Vischer|first1=Phil|title=Episode 200: THE BIG 2-0-0!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzD_J03KcuY| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211113/zzD_J03KcuY| archive-date=2021-11-13 | url-status=live|via=YouTube|access-date=January 22, 2017|date=May 10, 2016}}{{cbignore}}</ref> First offered in the direct-to-video market, the first release was the 30-minute video, ''[[Where's God When I'm S-Scared?]]'', in December 1993.<ref name="MeMyselfBob">{{cite book|last1=Vischer|first1=Phil|title=Me, Myself, & Bob: A True Story About God, Dreams, and Talking Vegetables|date=2008|publisher=T.

In January 2002, [[HIT Entertainment]] sued Big Idea claiming Big Idea "abruptly walked away" from a 1997 deal with [[Lyrick Studios]], which HIT acquired a year prior. The deal intended for HIT to manufacture and distribute VeggieTales merchandise.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/stories/2002/01/21/story1.html|title=Lawsuit over verbal pact pits Lyrick Studios, VeggieTales|last=Patrick|first=Stephanie|work=[[Dallas Business Journal]]|date=January 20, 2002|access-date=October 24, 2019}}</ref> Having had no written contract with either Lyrick or HIT, Big Idea arranged a production deal with [[Warner Home Video]], triggering the suit.

On June 29, 2021, Vischer stated in a series of posts on his [[Twitter]] account that his wife, Nawrocki and Heinecke had been dismissed from the franchise by Big Idea, who intended to recast the voices for their respective characters. He also stated that Nawrocki and Heinecke had been let go from the series several years beforehand for budgetary reasons. They had asked to have a bigger role in the franchise following their involvement in ''The VeggieTales Show'' and the company refused, resulting in their complete departure.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20210629172649/https://twitter.com/philvischer/status/1409926275683307522</ref>

==Characters==
{{Main|List of VeggieTales characters}}
The ''VeggieTales'' cartoons are [[teleplays]], performed by various vegetables and fruit that live together on the same kitchen countertop. Some of these characters have "real names," and take on various roles in the teleplays. Most of these "regulars characters", such as Larry, Bob, Junior Asparagus, Archibald Asparagus, Pa Grape, Jimmy and Jerry were established in the earliest videos.

==Video series==
{{main|List of VeggieTales videos}}

===Show format===
The videos generally present a moral issue in the opening countertop sequence, either through a viewer question or an issue brought up by Bob or Larry. Usually this is followed by one or more "films" that address the said issue, with ''[[Silly Songs with Larry]]'' in the middle.

''Silly Songs'' are generally introduced with a [[title card]] and a [[voice-over]] saying, "And now it's time for Silly Songs with Larry, the part of the show where Larry comes out and sings a silly song." Some ''Silly Songs'' have alternate titles, such as "Love Songs with Mr. Lunt," or "Ukulele Karaoke with Bob," where another character sings the song instead.<ref>{{Citation|last=VeggieTales Official|title=VeggieTales {{!}} Monkey Silly Song {{!}} Silly Songs With Larry {{!}} Kids Cartoon {{!}} Kids Videos {{!}} Kids Movies|date=April 30, 2019|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv9YwNGUSSU|access-date=May 1, 2019}}</ref> The ''Silly Song'', if one appears, is usually in the middle of the program, often at a [[cliffhanger]] moment or in between two stories (although the LarryBoy videos, in particular, often lack this segment, with the exception of ''League of Incredible Vegetables''). Each video ends with this program's signature sign-off: "Remember kids, God made you special and He loves you very much."<ref>{{Citation|last=Ultrocraze|title=From Veggietales- God made you special!|date=December 17, 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7mJkmDfuj0| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211113/U7mJkmDfuj0| archive-date=2021-11-13 | url-status=live|access-date=May 1, 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

===Re-issues and re-releases===
Big Idea has released a few "special edition" DVDs which consist of remastered videos and additional features not on the original DVD.

#''[[Lyle the Kindly Viking]] Special Edition (also includes 3–2–1 Penguins! Trouble on Planet Wait-Your-Turn)''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/VeggieTales-Kindly-Viking-Penguins-Feature/dp/B002SOP8O4// |title=VeggieTales: Lyle the Kindly Viking / 3–2–1 Penguins Double Feature (DVD) |access-date=April 5, 2015}}</ref>

===Compilation videos===
Various ''VeggieTales'' videos were bundled into collections. The collections ranged in size from double features to a boxed collection of the first 30 ''VeggieTales'' videos. Compilation videos of only the ''Silly Songs'' were also released. These song collections included the songs in "Sing Along" format and a countdown of the most popular Silly Songs as voted by fans of the show.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===''VeggieTales on TV!'' (2006–2009)===
For three seasons, ''VeggieTales on TV!'' ran on [[NBC]], [[Telemundo]], and [[Ion Television]] as part of the [[Qubo]] [[children's programming]] block from 2006 to 2009.<ref name="off-and-running">{{Cite web|url=https://philvischer.com/news/bob-and-larry-are-off-and-running/|title=Bob and Larry Are Off and Running! - Phil Vischer - Official Blog of VeggieTales Creator|date=September 15, 2006|website=Phil Vischer|access-date=August 10, 2019}}</ref> The television show altered the general format by opening at the front gate of [[Bob the Tomato]]'s house. Bob, [[Larry the Cucumber]], and other Veggie characters then sing the show's theme song as they hop to Bob's front door. The theme song ends with a character making a random comment, such as Pa Grape commenting on Archibald's new sweater. Bob and Larry then wait for the mailman, Jimmy Gourd, to deliver a letter. When Jimmy comes, he happily sings his Mail Song, which Bob and Larry both find tedious. Similar to the opening counter top sequence of the ''VeggieTales'' videos, Bob and Larry read the letter and the cast tries to decide how to solve the viewer's problem through one of three regular segments: Archibald reads a story from his Big Book of Oddities, Pa Grape shows an old film, or Mr. Lunt appears with his stick puppet (Paco the Storytelling Mule) and tells a story. The result always proves disastrous, as the story or film makes no sense. Bob and Larry then intervene with a story from a VeggieTales video. The show ends with Bob and Larry wrapping things up by reiterating the story's lesson and Bob thanking the kids for coming over to his house. NBC episodes end with characters bidding the audience a simple "Good-bye".

According to the [[Los Angeles Times]], "VeggieTales has been very successful for NBC in a Saturday morning time slot that has traditionally been difficult for the networks". NBC saw its biggest ratings jump in Saturday morning children's programming since 2003."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-sep-23-fi-veggies23-story.html|title=NBC Issues New Explanation for 'VeggieTales' Cuts|date=September 23, 2006|website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=August 10, 2019}}</ref> As a result, ratings on NBC's Saturday morning program had grown from an average [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen Rating]] of 0.5 between 2003 and 2005 to an average [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen Rating]] of 0.95 between 2006 and 2008, with an average of 430,000 children watching each weekend.<ref name="off-and-running" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.today.com/popculture/veggietales-stirs-religious-controversy-wbna14960737|title='VeggieTales' stirs up a religious controversy|website=TODAY.com|language=en|access-date=August 9, 2019}} {{verify source |date=September 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted ([[Special:Diff/910168749]]) by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite at [[Special:Permalink/910155484]] cite No. 10 - please verify the cite's accuracy and remove this {verify source} template.

After [[NBC]] aired the first few episodes of the first season in September 2006,<ref>{{cite web|last1=DeMott|first1=Rick|title=Qubo To Launch on NBC, Telemundo & The i Network This September|url=http://www.awn.com/news/qubo-launch-nbc-telemundo-i-network-september|access-date=May 20, 2016|publisher=Animation World Network|date=August 24, 2006}}</ref> the company chose to edit the episodes to remove religious messages, including references to [[God]]. The original sign-off message--"Remember kids, God made you special and He loves you very much!"—was replaced by "Thanks for coming to my house today, kids. See you next week! Good-bye!". The changes were made at the request of the network's [[standards and practices]] department to enforce compliance with network policies regarding religious neutrality. The original dialogue remained viewable by users of the network's closed-caption feature.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wesbury|first1=Joe|title=NBC chooses family values over spiritual values in VeggieTales Saturday morning line-up|url=http://www.tciarchive.org/2596.article|publisher=The Muslim Index|access-date=January 22, 2017|date=September 28, 2006}}</ref>

The conservative watch group [[Parents Television Council]] complained to NBC about the changes.<ref name=FOXStirControversy>{{cite web|title=Talking Veggies Stir Controversy at NBC|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,215266,00.html|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Fox News Channel|access-date=January 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629071019/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,215266,00.html|archive-date=June 29, 2011|date=September 22, 2006|url-status=live}}</ref> [[L. Brent Bozell III|L. Brent Bozell]], president of the group, complained of the network "ripping the heart and soul out of a successful product". His argument was that if NBC was concerned about references to God, they should not have taken the series.  Bozell stated "This just documents the disconnect between [[Hollywood]] and the real world."<ref name=FOXStirControversy />

The response from NBC stated the editing now conformed to the network's broadcast standards, which direct producers "not to advocate any one religious point of view." NBC spokeswoman Rebecca Marks said "Our goal is to reach as broad an audience as possible with these positive messages while being careful not to advocate any one religious point of view."<ref name="FOXStirControversy" />

Vischer said he was not aware the religious content would be removed and said he would have declined to sign the contract had he known. "I would have declined partly because I knew a lot of fans would feel like it was a [[sellout]] or it was done for money," he said.<ref name="FOXStirControversy" /> Vischer said he understood NBC's wish to remain religiously neutral, "VeggieTales is religious, NBC is not.

It was placed into production in early 2002, toward the end of production of ''Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie'' (2002).<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2008/januaryweb-only/philvischer.html|title=The More You Preach, the Fewer You Reach|last=Hertz|first=Todd|website=ChristianityToday.com|access-date=March 16, 2019}}</ref> However, Big Idea Productions fell into bankruptcy in late 2002 and the film was placed on hiatus, deemed too expensive. [[Phil Vischer]] then wrote ''[[The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie]]'' to replace this movie. In 2008, it was considered to be the sequel to ''The Pirates who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie'', but talks stalled after the 2008 recession had led to the bankruptcy of VeggieTales owner ''Entertainment Rights'' and ''Classic Media.'' According to Phil Vischer in 2018, "I have a copy of ''The Bob and Larry'' script on my laptop, but probably won't release it because it is technically owned by Universal and DreamWorks.""It will hopefully be produced in the near future."<ref name="auto1" />
