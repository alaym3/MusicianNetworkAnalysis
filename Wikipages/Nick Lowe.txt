==Biography==
Lowe attended the independent [[Woodbridge School]] in [[Suffolk]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://norfolk.greatbritishlife.co.uk/article/the-famous-old-boys-and-girls-from-norfolk-independent-schools-october-2009-18975/ |title=Great British Life Norfolk Independent Schools. Retrieved 8 January 2012 |publisher=Norfolk.greatbritishlife.co.uk |date=18 March 2010 |access-date=22 February 2014}}</ref>  He began his musical career in 1967, when he joined the band Kippington Lodge, along with his school friend [[Brinsley Schwarz (musician)|Brinsley Schwarz]]. They released a few singles on the [[Parlophone]] record label as Kippington Lodge before they renamed the band [[Brinsley Schwarz]] in late 1969 and began performing [[country music|country]] and [[blues-rock]]. The band were launched by their management company Famepushers Ltd with an appearance at New York's [[Fillmore East]]; a planeload of British journalists were flown over by Famepushers to witness the event, but the stunt backfired and Brinsley Schwarz became a laughing stock until they established credibility on the London pub rock circuit.<ref name="No Sleep Till Canvey Island: The Great Pub Rock Revolution">{{cite book | first= Will | last= Birch | year= 2003 | title= No Sleep Till Canvey Island: The Great Pub Rock Revolution | publisher= Virgin Books | location= London | isbn= 0-7535-0740-4 | url-access= registration | url= https://archive.org/details/nosleeptillcanve00birc }}</ref> Lowe wrote some of his best-known compositions while a member of the band, including "[[(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding]]", a hit for [[Elvis Costello]] in 1979; and "[[Cruel to Be Kind]]", also in 1979, Lowe's single and biggest worldwide hit, co-written with bandmate [[Ian Gomm]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book

After leaving Brinsley Schwarz in 1975 Lowe began playing bass in [[Rockpile]] with [[Dave Edmunds]]. In August 1976, Lowe released "[[So It Goes (Nick Lowe song)|So It Goes]]" b/w "Heart of the City", the first single on the [[Stiff Records]] [[record label|label]], where he was an in-house producer.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> The single and the label were funded by a loan of £400 from [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]]'s [[Lee Brilleaux]]. The label's first [[Extended play|EP]] was Lowe's 1977 four-track release ''[[Bowi (EP)|Bowi]]'', apparently named in response to [[David Bowie]]'s contemporaneous LP ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]''. The joke was repeated when Lowe produced [[the Rumour]]'s album ''Max'' as an 'answer' to [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]''. Lowe continued producing albums on Stiff and other labels. In 1977 he produced Dr. Feelgood's album, ''[[Be Seeing You]]'', which included "That's It, I Quit", written by Lowe. ''[[Private Practice (album)|Private Practice]]'', issued the next year, included "[[Milk and Alcohol]]", written by Lowe and [[Gypie Mayo]]. This song and "[[I Love the Sound of Breaking Glass]]" are the only Lowe compositions to reach the Top 10 of the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums 2">{{ cite book | first= David | last= Roberts | year= 2006 | title= British Hit Singles & Albums | edition= 19th | publisher=Guinness World Records Limited | location= London | page= 162 | isbn= 1-904994-10-5 }}</ref>

Because the two main singers in Rockpile had [[recording contract]]s with different record labels and managers, albums were always credited to either Lowe or Edmunds, so there is only one official Rockpile album, 1980's ''[[Seconds of Pleasure]]'', which was not released until the waning days of the collaboration. ''Seconds of Pleasure'' featured the Lowe songs "When I Write the Book" and "Heart". However, two of the pair's most significant solo albums from the period, Lowe's ''[[Labour of Lust]]'' and Edmunds' ''[[Repeat When Necessary]]'', were effectively Rockpile albums, as was [[Carlene Carter]]'s Lowe-produced ''[[Musical Shapes]]'' album. Lowe's album ''Labour of Lust'' received a gold certification in Canada in November 1979.<ref name="musiccanada.com">{{cite web|url=https://musiccanada.com/gold-platinum/certification/gold-albums/page/515/ |title=GOLD ALBUM(S) Archives - Page 515 of 590 |publisher=Music Canada |access-date=14 March 2016}}</ref>

Lowe was quoted as saying that he had "escaped from the tyranny of the snare drum" in ''No Depression'', (September–October 2001) when explaining his move away from regular pop music that would get played on mainstream radio.<ref name=NoDepression>{{cite journal|journal=No Depression|last=Cantwell|first=David|title=His aim is true: Nick Lowe has found the way to play wisdom over witticism|date=Sep–Oct 2001|url=http://archives.nodepression.com/2001/09/his-aim-is-true/6/|access-date=3 July 2013|quote=In this setting, Lowe says, freed from the 'tyranny of the snare drum,' he’s able to sing quietly, the better to explore the deeper nooks and crannies of his mature voice.|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110122238/http://archives.nodepression.com/2001/09/his-aim-is-true/6/|archive-date=10 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Other well-known Lowe songs include "All Men Are Liars" and "[[Cruel to Be Kind]]", co-written with [[Ian Gomm]] and originally recorded with Brinsley Schwarz for their unreleased final album ''It's All Over Now''. A re-recording of "Cruel to Be Kind" was his only US [[Top 40]] [[hit record|hit]], reaching No.&nbsp;12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]] in 1979.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

In 1979, Lowe married country singer [[Carlene Carter]], daughter of fellow country singers [[Carl Smith (country musician)|Carl Smith]] and [[June Carter Cash]] and stepdaughter of [[Johnny Cash]].<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years 2">{{cite book

He played and recorded with Johnny Cash, and Cash recorded several of Lowe's songs. Lowe and Carter's 1979 wedding was filmed and the footage became the basis for the promotional video clip for "Cruel to Be Kind".

After the demise of Rockpile, Lowe toured for a period with his band Noise to Go and later with the Cowboy Outfit, which also included the noted keyboard player [[Paul Carrack]]. Lowe was also a member of the short-lived mainly studio project [[Little Village]] with [[John Hiatt]], [[Ry Cooder]] and [[Jim Keltner]], who originally got together to record Hiatt's 1987 album ''[[Bring the Family]]''.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

In 1990 he wrote a song, "Who Was That Man?"<ref>{{cite web|title=NICK LOWE lyrics – Who Was That Man?|url=http://www.oldielyrics.com/lyrics/nick_lowe/who_was_that_man.html|access-date=5 November 2014}}</ref> about a man who died in the [[King's Cross fire]]. In 1992 "(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding" was [[cover version|covered]] by [[Curtis Stigers]] on the soundtrack album to ''[[The Bodyguard (1992 film)|The Bodyguard]]'', an album that sold about 44&nbsp;million copies worldwide.<ref name=NYTimes14Sep2011/>

A New York ''Daily News'' article<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/2007/06/17/2007-06-17_cruel_to_be_kind_of_old-1.html |title="Cruel to be kind of old," by Jim Farber, New York Daily News, 17 June 2007 |publisher=Nydailynews.com |date=17 June 2007 |access-date=22 February 2014}}</ref> quoted Lowe as saying his greatest fear in recent years was "sticking with what you did when you were famous." "I didn't want to become one of those thinning-haired, jowly old geezers who still does the same shtick they did when they were young, slim and beautiful," he said. "That's revolting and rather tragic." Rock critic Jim Farber observed, "Lowe's recent albums, epitomised by the new ''[[At My Age]]'', moved him out of the realms of ironic pop and animated rock and into the role of a worldly balladeer, specialising in grave vocals and graceful tunes. Lowe's four most recent solo albums mine the wealth of American roots music, drawing on vintage country, soul and R&B to create an elegant mix of his own."

In 2008, [[Yep Roc]] and [[Proper Records]] released a thirtieth anniversary edition of Lowe's first solo album, ''[[Jesus of Cool]]'' (entitled ''[[Pure Pop for Now People]]'' in the US, with a slightly different track listing). The re-issue includes tracks from the British and American releases in addition to several bonus tracks. In March 2009, he released a 49-track CD/DVD [[compilation album|compilation]] of songs spanning his entire career. Proper Records released it in the UK and Europe, entitled ''[[Quiet Please... The New Best of Nick Lowe]]''.

In September 2010 Yep Roc issued ''[[The Impossible Bird]]'', ''[[Dig My Mood]]'' and ''[[The Convincer]]'' on vinyl for the first time, and after a one-night reunion concert with Elvis Costello in October in San Francisco,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fortnightlyreview.co.uk/2010/12/nick-lowe-the-true-blue-basher-shows-up-for-a-friend/|title=Nick Lowe: the true blue Basher shows up for a friend |publisher=The Fortnightly Review|date=18 December 2010|access-date=18 December 2010}}</ref>  Lowe embarked on his first non-solo United States tour "this millennium." His backing band consisted of [[Geraint Watkins]] (keyboards), Robert Treherne (drums), [[Johnny Scott (musician)|Johnny Scott]] (guitar) and Matt Radford (bass). In March 2011, [[Yep Roc]] reissued Lowe's 1979 solo album ''[[Labour of Lust]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2010/08/nick_lowe_touri.html|title=Nick Lowe touring w/ full band, playing 4 NY shows (dates)|publisher=Brooklyn Vegan|date=30 August 2010|access-date=5 September 2010}}</ref>

Lowe played Glastonbury 2011, performing a short solo set of Brinsley Schwarz tracks on The Spirit of 71 stage, where they played back in 1971, before heading to the Acoustic Stage for a full band show. On 29 October 2013, he released his first Christmas album, ''Quality Street'', on Yep Roc Records.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2013/07/half-christmas-special-stream-nick-lowes-christmas.html|title=Stream Nick Lowe's New Holiday Album Quality Street: A Seasonal Selection For All The Family|work=pastemagazine.com|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en}}</ref> He performed two songs from this album on 7 December taping of NPR's ''[[Wait Wait...

===Songwriter===
Lowe's best-known songs include his own hits:
* "[[So It Goes (song)|So It Goes]]" – first song on the [[Stiff Records]] label
* "[[I Love the Sound of Breaking Glass]]" – his biggest UK hit
* "[[Cruel to Be Kind]]" – his biggest US hit

He also wrote songs most famous for their cover versions:
* "[[(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding]]" – famously covered by [[Elvis Costello]]
* "[[I Knew the Bride|I Knew the Bride (When She Used to Rock ’n’ Roll)]]" – a hit for [[Rockpile]] bandmate [[Dave Edmunds]]
* "[[The Beast in Me]]" – covered by stepfather-in-law [[Johnny Cash]]

Some songs were written or co-written for albums he produced:
* "[[Milk and Alcohol]]" and "That’s It, I Quit" – [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]]
* "(I Live on a) Battlefield" and "I Need You" – [[Paul Carrack]]

Lowe also wrote a number of songs with clever wordplay that qualify as "[[novelty song|novelties]]", among them:
* "Bay City Rollers We Love You" – recorded as "Terry Modern" of "The Tartan Horde"
* "I Love My Label" – paean to the United Artists label, released on Stiff Records
* "[[All Men Are Liars (song)|All Men Are Liars]]"
* "Half a Boy and Half a Man"

===Producer===
Lowe's work as a producer is at least as notable as his work as a performer and songwriter.  His early 'rough and ready' production style earned him the nickname "Basher", inspired by his supposed instructions to bands to 'bash it out—we'll tart it up later'. Beginning with his tenure at Stiff Records as an in-house producer in 1976, Lowe was responsible for producing some of the benchmark releases of punk and new wave, including the [[The Damned (band)|Damned]]'s first single, "[[New Rose]]", considered the first English punk single, as well as the group's debut album, ''[[Damned Damned Damned]]''. He also produced [[Elvis Costello]]'s first five albums, from 1977 to 1981, including ''[[My Aim Is True]]'', ''[[This Year's Model]]'', and ''[[Armed Forces (album)|Armed Forces]]'', which spun off numerous UK hit singles.  Other Stiff acts produced by Lowe included punk parody group [[Alberto y Lost Trios Paranoias]], new wave icon [[Wreckless Eric]] and roots rocker [[Mickey Jupp]].

Other clients (both before and after Lowe left Stiff in 1978) included the [[The Pretenders|Pretenders]] (the 1978 debut single "[[Stop Your Sobbing]]", which was a modest UK and U.S. hit); Graham Parker (his well-received first and third albums); [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]] (several LPs, and their biggest hit single, 1979's "[[Milk and Alcohol]]"); [[Johnny Cash]] (his 1980 single "Without Love", a minor hit on the U.S. and Canadian country charts); and his then-wife [[Carlene Carter]] (2 albums in 1980 and 1981).

From 1982 to 1985, he produced material for [[Paul Carrack]], [[John Hiatt]], the [[The Fabulous Thunderbirds|Fabulous Thunderbirds]] and the [[The Men They Couldn't Hang|Men They Couldn't Hang]]. Beginning in the mid-80s, Lowe became more selective in his choice of outside production tasks, helming the 1986 LP ''[[Blood & Chocolate]]'' for Elvis Costello, a 1988 single ("Windows of the World" b/w "1969") for the Pretenders, and the [[Katydids (band)|Katydids]]' self-titled debut album of 1990. After that, Lowe essentially retired from producing recordings for other acts, although the country-rock band the [[The Mavericks|Mavericks]] persuaded him to produce one track for the ''Apollo 13'' soundtrack in 1995.

In 2011 the ''New York Times'' claimed, "The 40-year career of the English singer-songwriter Nick Lowe constitutes a paradox: the songs he has written are better known than he is."<ref name="NYTimes14Sep2011" /> [[Alex Turner (musician)|Alex Turner]], of the [[Arctic Monkeys]], described Lowe as one of his favourite lyricists.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Orellana |first1=Patricio |title=Alex Turner: "Creo que las cosas eran más cool en el pasado" - Rolling Stone Argentina |url=https://www.rollingstone.com.ar/1459775-alex-turner-creo-que-las-cosas-eran-mas-cool-en-el-pasado |access-date=15 August 2018 |work=Rolling Stone |date=26 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180815200956/http://www.rollingstone.com.ar/1459775-alex-turner-creo-que-las-cosas-eran-mas-cool-en-el-pasado |archive-date=15 August 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In another interview, he said that he was "blown away" and sent "back to square one" by Lowe's songwriting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://itsoktolikenicklowe.com/arctic-monkeys-give-props-to-nick |title=The Arctic Monkeys' Alex Turner gives props to Nick &#124; It's OK to Like Nick Lowe |publisher=Itsoktolikenicklowe.com |date=8 July 2011 |access-date=14 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001081932/http://itsoktolikenicklowe.com/arctic-monkeys-give-props-to-nick |archive-date=1 October 2012 }}</ref>

[[Wilco]] covered the Nick Lowe song "I Love My Label" as the B-side to "I Might" (2011) on their own dBpm label.
