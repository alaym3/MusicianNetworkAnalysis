In spite of this, the group has sold over 10 million units in the United States alone. Drawing on its members' own experiences of [[Racism in the United States|racism]] and excessive policing, the group made inherently political music.<ref>[https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/08/straight-outta-compton-nwa/401279/ "Straight Outta Compton and the Social Burdens of Hip-Hop"]. ''[[The Atlantic]]''. Retrieved August 20, 2017</ref> The group's members were known for their deep hatred of the police system, which has sparked much controversy over the years.

The original lineup, formed in early 1987,<ref name="quintet"/> consisted of [[Arabian Prince]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[Eazy-E]], and [[Ice Cube]], with [[DJ Yella]] and [[MC Ren]] joining later that year. They released their first compilation album as a group in 1987 called ''[[N.W.A. and the Posse]]'', which peaked at No. 39 on ''Billboard'' magazine's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Arabian Prince left shortly after the release of N.W.A's debut studio album, ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', in 1988, with Ice Cube following suit in December 1989.<!-- Before changing the date to January 1990, please see [[Talk:N.W.A#Date of Ice Cube's departure]]. --> Eazy-E, Ice Cube, MC Ren and Dr. Dre would later become [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]]-selling solo artists in their own right in the 1990s. The group's debut album marked the beginning of the new gangsta rap era as the production and social commentary in their lyrics were revolutionary within the genre. N.W.A's second studio album, ''[[Niggaz4Life]]'', was the first hardcore rap album to reach number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] sales charts.<ref name="allmusic" />

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked N.W.A at number 83 on its [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time"]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061017054537/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/the_immortals "100 Greatest Artists of All Time"], ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.</ref> In 2016, the group was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], following three previous nominations.

===Formation and "Panic Zone" (1987–88)===

N.W.A was assembled by [[Compton, California|Compton]]-based [[Eazy-E]], who co-founded [[Ruthless Records]] with [[Jerry Heller]]. Eazy-E sought an introduction to Steve Yano. Although Yano initially rebuffed him, he was impressed by Eazy-E's persistence, and arranged a meeting with [[Dr. Dre]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/apr/14/magazine/tm-37890 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=April 14, 2002 |access-date=July 26, 2015}}</ref> Initially, N.W.A consisted of Eazy-E and Dr. Dre. Together with fellow producer [[Arabian Prince]], [[Ice Cube]] was added to the roster after he had started out as a rapper for the group [[C.I.A.

Dre and Yella were both formerly members of the [[World Class Wreckin' Cru]] as DJs and producers. Ruthless released the single "[[Panic Zone]]" in 1987 with Macola Records, which was later included on the compilation album ''[[N.W.A. and the Posse]]''. N.W.A was still in its developing stages, and is only credited on three of the eleven tracks, notably the uncharacteristic record "Panic Zone", "8-Ball", and "Dopeman", which marked the first collaboration of Arabian Prince, DJ Yella, Dr. Dre, and Ice Cube. Mexican rapper Krazy-Dee co-wrote "Panic Zone", which was originally called "Hispanic Zone", but the title was later changed when Dr. Dre advised Krazy-Dee that the word "hispanic" would hinder sales.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cizmar |first=Martin |url=http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/uponsun/2010/03/krazy_d_what_happened_after_nw.php?page=3 |title=Krazy D: What Happened After N.W.A. and the Posse? |work=Phoenix New Times|date=March 22, 2010 |access-date=April 11, 2012}}</ref> Also included was Eazy-E's solo track "[[Boyz-n-the-Hood]]".<ref>Henderson, Alex.

N.W.A released their debut studio album, ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', in 1988. With its famous opening salvo of three tracks, the group reflected the rising anger of the urban youth. The opening song "[[Straight Outta Compton (song)|Straight Outta Compton]]" introduced the group, "[[Fuck tha Police]]" protested [[police brutality]] and [[racial profiling]], and "[[Gangsta Gangsta (N.W.A song)|Gangsta Gangsta]]" painted the [[World view|worldview]] of the inner-city youth. While the group was later credited with pioneering the burgeoning subgenre of [[gangsta rap]], N.W.A referred to their music as "reality rap".<ref>Duff, S.L. [http://music.yahoo.com/ar-259130-bio--NWA N.W.A. YA BOY Biography]. [[Yahoo! Music]]. Retrieved August 17, 2007.</ref>

Twenty-seven years later, member and co-producer of the ''Straight Outta Compton'' film, Ice Cube, commented "they were talking about what really led into the style that we ended up doing, which is now called hardcore gangster rap."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/ice-cube-on-n-w-as-reality-rap-and-straight-outta-compton-movie-106622/|title= Ice Cube On N.W.A's 'Reality Rap' And 'Straight Outta Compton' Movie|last=Grow|first=Kory|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=February 20, 2016|date=April 15, 2015}}</ref> Dr. Dre and DJ Yella, as HighPowered Productions, composed the beats for each song, with Dre making occasional rapping appearances. The D.O.C., Ice Cube, and MC Ren wrote most of the group's lyrics, including "Fuck tha Police", perhaps the group's most notorious song, which brought them into conflict with various [[law enforcement agencies]]. Under pressure from [[Focus on the Family]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Nuzum |first=Eric |title=[[Parental Advisory: Music Censorship in America]] |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |location=New York City |year=2001 |page=[https://archive.org/details/parentaladvisory00nuzu/page/111 111] |isbn=0-688-16772-1}}</ref> Milt Ahlerich, an assistant director of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] sent a letter to Ruthless and its distributing company [[Priority Records]], advising the rappers that "advocating violence and assault is wrong and we in the law enforcement community take exception to such action." This letter can still be seen at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].<ref name="20th Anniversary">{{cite news |last=Boucher |first=Geoff |title=Rapper Ice Cube talks about the 20th anniversary of N.W.A's ''Straight Outta Compton'' |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-compton16-2008aug16,0,4400312.story |work=Los Angeles Times |date=August 16, 2008 |access-date=August 24, 2008}}</ref> Policemen refused to provide security for the group's concerts, hurting their plans to tour. Nonetheless, the FBI's letter only served to draw more publicity to the group.

''Straight Outta Compton'' was also one of the first albums to adhere to the new [[Parental Advisory]] label scheme, then still in its early stages: the label at the time consisted of "WARNING: Moderate impact coarse language and/or themes" only. However, the taboo nature of N.W.A's music was the most important factor of its mass appeal. Media coverage compensated for the group's lack of airplay, and its album eventually went double [[Platinum album|platinum]].<ref name="straight out of comptonreview">{{cite web |last=Huey |first=Steve |title=Straight Outta Compton > Overview |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r186556|pure_url=yes}} |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=August 17, 2007}}</ref> One month after ''Straight Outta Compton'', Eazy-E's solo debut ''[[Eazy-Duz-It]]'' was released. The album was dominated by Eazy's persona (MC Ren was the only guest rapper) but behind the scenes it was a group effort.

Music was handled by Dr. Dre and DJ Yella; the lyrics were largely written by MC Ren, with contributions from Ice Cube and [[The D.O.C.]] The album was another double platinum success for Ruthless<ref>{{cite web |author=Nadia Vega |url=http://www.Easye.info/biography.html |title=Biography #5 &#124; Amazing Pictures and Wallpapers &#124; World Amazing Pictures and HD Wallpapers |publisher=Easye.info |date=May 17, 2015 |access-date=July 26, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127224845/http://easye.info/biography.html |archive-date=January 27, 2016 }}</ref> (in addition to girl group [[J.J. Fad]] in 1988 and singer [[Michel'le]] in 1989). 1989 saw the re-issue of ''N.W.A and the Posse'' and ''Straight Outta Compton'' on CD, and the release of The D.O.C.'s ''[[No One Can Do It Better]]''. His album was essentially a collaboration with Dr. Dre and notably free of "gangsta rap" content, including the N.W.A [[posse cut]] "The Grand Finalé". It would become another #1 album for the record label.

===''100 Miles And Runnin''' and ''Niggaz4Life'' (1989–91)===

''[[The Guardian]]'', February 25, 2000.</ref> A lawsuit brought by Ice Cube against band manager Jerry Heller was settled out of court.<ref>Ice Cube: Attitude, Joel McIver, p.70, Foruli Classics, 2012</ref> He wasted little time putting together his solo debut, 1990's ''[[AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted]]'', but he avoided mentioning his former label mates. N.W.A's title track from their 1990 [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[100 Miles and Runnin']]'', however, included a [[wikt:diss|diss]] of Ice Cube:
''"We started with five, but yo / One couldn't take it—So now it's four / Cuz the fifth couldn't make it."'' The video for the song depicted the remaining members of N.W.A together in a jail cell, while an Ice Cube look-alike is released.

Also heard on the EP (which found its way on the ''[[Efil4zaggin]]'' album) was "Real Niggaz", a full-blown diss on Ice Cube where the remaining members accuse him of cowardice, and question his authenticity, longevity and originality: ''"How the fuck you think a rapper lasts / With your ass sayin' shit that was said in the past / Yo, be original, your shit is sloppy / Get off the dick, you motherfuckin' carbon-copy"'', and ''"We started out with too much cargo / So I'm glad we got rid of [[Benedict Arnold]], yo."''

The song "100 Miles and Runnin'" was Dr. Dre's final [[uptempo]] recording, which had been a common feature of late 1980s hip hop. After this, he focused on a midtempo, [[synthesizer]] based sound which would become known as [[G-funk]], starting with "[[Alwayz Into Somethin']]" from ''Efil4zaggin'' in 1991. The G-funk style dominated both the West and East Coast hip hop music scene for several years to come.

N.W.A is referenced on Ice Cube's 1990 EP, ''[[Kill at Will]]'', where he name-checks his former group (likely in a mocking manner) on the song "Jackin' For Beats". On "I Gotta Say What Up!!!", Ice Cube gives shout-outs to his rap peers at the time, among them [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[Geto Boys]], and [[Sir Jinx]]. At the end of the track, in what appears to be an on-the-phone interview, Ice Cube is asked, "Since you went solo, what's up with the rest of the crew?" and the phone is abruptly hung up on the interviewer.

The group's second full-length release, 1991's ''Efil4zaggin'' ("Niggaz4Life" spelled backwards), re-established the band in the face of Ice Cube's continued solo success. The album is considered by many Dr. Dre's finest production work, and it heralded the beginning of the G-Funk era. It also showed a clear animosity towards their former member, and derogatory references to Ice Cube are found in several songs. The interlude "A Message to B.A." echoes the beginning of his song "Turn Off the Radio" from ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'': Ice Cube is first addressed by the name Benedict Arnold (after the infamous traitor of the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]]) but then named outright in a torrent of abuse from both the group and its fans: ''"When we see yo' ass, we gon' cut yo' hair off and fuck you with a broomstick"'' spoken by MC Ren.<ref name="Nuzum, p. 113">Nuzum, p. 113.</ref>

The N.W.A–Ice Cube feud eventually escalated, both on record and in real life. ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'' had avoided direct attacks on N.W.A, but on ''[[Death Certificate (album)|Death Certificate]]'', Ice Cube's second full-length release, he retaliated. He sampled and mocked the "Message to B.A." skit before embarking on a full-blown tirade, the infamous "[[No Vaseline]]". In a series of verses, Ice Cube verbally assaulted the group: ''"You lookin' like straight bozos / I saw it comin' that's why I went solo / Kept on stompin' / When y'all Muthafuckas moved Straight outta Compton / You got jealous when I got my own company / But I'm a man, and ain't nobody humpin' me."''<ref name="Nuzum, p. 113"/>

He also responded to members MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Eazy-E individually to "100 Miles and Runnin'", claiming ''"I started off with too much cargo / Dropped four niggaz and now I'm makin' all the dough"'', using homophobic metaphors to describe their unequal business relationship with Jerry Heller, who became the target of harsh insults:
''"Get rid of that devil real simple / Put a bullet in his temple / Cuz you can't be the 'Niggaz 4 Life' crew / With a white [[Jew]] tellin' you what to do."'' The song attracted controversy for its [[antisemitism]] (the beginning of such accusations against Ice Cube during his affiliation with the [[Nation of Islam]]), based on the bashing of Heller's religion.<ref name="Nuzum, p. 113"/>

The track was omitted from the UK release, and later pressings included a censored version of the song. In September 1990, members of hip hop act [[Above the Law (group)|Above the Law]] clashed with Ice Cube and his posse [[Da Lench Mob]] during the annual [[New Music Seminar]] conference, forcing the latter to flee the premises of [[Times Square]]'s [[New York Marriott Marquis|Marriott Marquis]], the venue of the event.<ref name="blackwell">Blackwell, Mark.

Dre followed her and "grabbed her from behind by the hair and proceeded to punch her in the back of the head."<ref name="light"/>}}

In response, Dre commented: "People talk all this shit, but you know, if somebody fucks with me, I'm gonna fuck with them. I just did it, you know. Ain't nothing you can do now by talking about it. Besides, it ain't no big thing—I just threw her through a door."<ref name="light">Light, Alan. "Beating Up the Charts". ''Rolling Stone'', August 8, 1991, p. 66.</ref>

===The end of N.W.A (1991–95)===
[[File:Eazy-E.jpg|thumb|Eazy-E (pictured in 1993) feuded with the other former members of the group until his death in 1995]]
1991's ''Niggaz4Life'' would be the group's final album. After Dr. Dre, The D.O.C. and Michel'le departed from Ruthless to join [[Death Row Records]] and allegations over Eazy-E being coerced into signing away their contracts (while however retaining a portion of their publishing rights), a bitter rivalry ensued.<ref name="allmusic" /> Dr. Dre began the exchange with Death Row's first release, 1992's ''[[Fuck Wit Dre Day (And Everybody's Celebratin')]]'', and its accompanying video featured a character named "Sleazy-E" who ran around desperately trying to get money. The insults continued on ''[[The Chronic]]'' with "Bitches Ain't Shit". Eazy-E responded in 1993 with the EP ''[[It's On (Dr. Dre) 187um Killa|It's On (<s>Dr. Dre</s>) 187um Killa]]'' on the tracks "[[Real Muthaphuckkin G's]]" and "It's On".

Eazy-E accused Dr. Dre of being a homosexual, calling him a "she thang", and criticizing Dre's new image by calling him and Snoop "studio gangsters". The music video for "Real Muthaphuckkin G's" showed a still of Dre wearing make-up and a sequined jumpsuit. The photos dated back to Dr. Dre's World Class Wreckin' Cru days, when such fashion was common among West Coast electro hop artists, prior to N.W.A's popularization of gangsta rap. Eazy-E kept dissing Dre and Death Row on most of his songs until his [[AIDS]]-related death on March 26, 1995.

Even Eazy-E's longtime friend MC Ren voiced his dislike for Eazy-E in 1994, calling Eazy-E a "big-head" and "wannabe mega-star", and even suggesting that N.W.A should reunite without Eazy-E.<ref>O'Connor, Christopher. [https://www.flickr.com/photos/21630929@N04/2096147512/in/photolist-4qm9F3-4qm7Bw-4qm8vJ-4cewG9-4qm72w-4qm991-4ca3Yn-4caiSc-4ca35t-4ceiCm-4cehAW-vhKRw4-vhKR3P Shock Treatment], [[The Source]], February 7, 1994.</ref> MC Ren later said that the only relationship he had with Eazy-E was through Ruthless Records, where he released several gold and platinum selling albums, including ''[[Kizz My Black Azz]]'' and ''[[Shock of the Hour]]''. Eazy-E and MC Ren would squash their beef shortly before Eazy-E's death in their 1995 duet '"[[Tha Muthaphukkin' Real]]" after two years of not talking to each other. All bad blood finally ceased within the rest of the group. Dr. Dre, MC Ren and Ice Cube would later express their re-evaluated feelings to their old friend on 1998's "Ruthless for Life", 1999's "What's the Difference" and "Chin Check", 2000's "Hello", 2006's "Growin' Up", and in the 2011 music video "[[I Need a Doctor]]".

===Reunions and legacy (1995–present)===
Having both parted with Ruthless Records on bad terms, tensions between Ice Cube and Dr. Dre eventually eased on their own. After Ice Cube made a [[cameo appearance]] in Dr. Dre's "[[Let Me Ride]]" video in 1993, the two recorded the hit song "[[Natural Born Killaz]]" for [[Snoop Dogg|Snoop Doggy Dogg]]'s 1994 short film and soundtrack ''[[Murder Was the Case]]''. Ice Cube also later appeared on MC Ren's album ''[[Ruthless for Life]]'' on the track "[[Comin' After You]]". MC Ren appeared on Dre's 1999 album ''[[2001 (Dr. Dre album)|2001]]'', and the three remaining N.W.A emcees would reunite for "[[Hello (Ice Cube song)|Hello]]" on Ice Cube's 2000 album ''[[War & Peace Vol. 2 (The Peace Disc)]]'', and the song "[[Chin Check]]" in 1999 for the [[Next Friday (soundtrack)|''Next Friday'' soundtrack]], a movie starring Ice Cube.<ref name="Baker"/>

The West Coast and "gangsta" music scene had however fallen out of the spotlight since the death of [[Tupac Shakur]] in 1996, and it was only after Dr. Dre's successful patronage of [[Eminem]] and Dre's ensuing comeback album ''[[2001 (Dr. Dre album)|2001]]'' that the genre and its artists would regain the national spotlight. 2000's all-star [[Up In Smoke Tour]] would reunite much of the N.W.A and Death Row families, and during time spent on the road, Dre, Ice Cube, MC Ren, featured special guest Snoop Dogg<ref>{{cite web |last=Ives |first=Brian |title=Dr. Dre Talks N.W.A.

However, due to busy and conflicting schedules as well as the obstacles of coordinating three different record labels ([[Priority Records|Priority]], [[No Limit Records|No Limit]] and [[Interscope Records|Interscope]]), obtaining the rights to the name N.W.A and endorsing the whole project to gain exclusive rights, the album never materialized.<ref>Moss, Corey.

May Still Have Attitude but They Don't Have an Album], [[MTV]], April 25, 2002.</ref> Only two tracks from these sessions would be released: the aforementioned "Chin Check" (with Snoop Dogg as a member of N.W.A) from 2000's [[Next Friday (soundtrack)|''Next Friday'' soundtrack]] and "[[Hello (Ice Cube song)|Hello]]" from Ice Cube's 2000 album ''[[War & Peace Vol. 2 (The Peace Disc)]]''. Both songs would also appear on N.W.A's [[Audio mastering|remastered]] ''[[Greatest Hits (N.W.A)|Greatest Hits]]''. There would also be partial reunions on other projects, notably "Set It Off", from Snoop Dogg's ''[[Tha Last Meal]]'' (2000), which featured MC Ren and Ice Cube, and The D.O.C.'s "The Shit", from his 2003 album ''[[Deuce (The D.O.C. album)|Deuce]]'', featuring MC Ren, Ice Cube, Snoop Dogg and Six-Two. Dr. Dre and DJ Yella were present in the studio for the latter song.

In addition to the ''Greatest Hits'' initially released by Priority in 1996, [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] and Ruthless Records jointly released ''[[The N.W.A Legacy, Vol. 1: 1988–1998]]'' in 1999, a compilation that contained songs by other rap artists and only three songs from the actual group but various solo tracks from the five members. The success of the album prompted a second volume, ''[[The N.W.A Legacy, Vol. 2]]'', three years later. It emulated the format of its predecessor, containing only three genuine N.W.A tracks and many solo efforts by the crew members. In 2007, a new greatest hits package was released, entitled ''[[The Best of N.W.A: The Strength of Street Knowledge]]''.

In 2014, Ice Cube appeared on MC Ren's remix for "[[Rebel Music (song)|Rebel Music]]". This was the first time the duo had worked together since the N.W.A reunion in 2000.<ref>Tardio, Andres.

On June 27, 2015, MC Ren and DJ Yella joined Ice Cube during his solo set as part of the BET Experience show at the [[Staples Center]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]. This marked the first reunion performance of the group (minus Dr. Dre) in 15 years. Following a 27-year hiatus, the group reunited with surviving members Ice Cube, MC Ren, Dr. Dre and DJ Yella taking the stage during the second weekend of the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] in April 2016, just days following the group's Rock N' Roll Hall of Fame induction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radio.com/2016/04/24/nwa-reunites-at-coachella-with-ice-cube-dr-dre-dj-yella-mc-ren/ |title=N.W.A.

[[New Line Cinema]] representatives announced to ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'s'' "Hollywood Insider Blog" that N.W.A's story was in development to become a feature film for theatrical release in 2012. However, it was delayed to sometime in 2014. The script was researched and written by filmmaker [[S.

[[Casting call]]s began in the summer of 2010. There were rumors of [[Lil Eazy-E]] playing his late father Eazy-E, and Ice Cube's son and fellow rapper [[O'Shea Jackson Jr.]] playing his father as well. Ice Cube stated of the movie, "We're taking it to the nooks and crannies, I think deeper than any other article or documentary on the group," he said. "These are the intimate conversations that helped forge N.W.A. To me, I think it's interesting to anybody who loves that era and I don't know any other movie where you can mix Gangster Rap, the F.B.I., L.A. riots, HIV, and fucking feuding with each other.

Although the group disbanded in 1991, it remains one of the greatest and most influential hip-hop groups, leaving a lasting legacy on hip hop music in the following decades.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Its influence, from the use of funky, bass-driven beats to its exaggerated lyrics, was evident throughout the 1990s and even into the present, and is often credited as bridging the white/black American musical lines with its appeal to white Americans in the late 1980s.<ref>White, Miles (2011).

In Dr. Dre's 1999 single "[[Forgot About Dre]]", [[Eminem]] pays homage to the group, rapping "So what do you say to somebody you hate / Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way? / Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? / Just study a tape of N.W.A", possibly referring to the negative reception of N.W.A's works by mainstream radio, which considered the group's songs violent.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dr. Dre – Forgot About Dre Lyrics |url=http://rapgenius.com/Dr-dre-forgot-about-dre-lyrics |publisher=[[Rap Genius]] |access-date=October 13, 2012}}</ref>
