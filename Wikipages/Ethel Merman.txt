'''Ethel Merman''' (born '''Ethel Agnes Zimmermann''', January 16, 1908 – February 15, 1984) was an American actress, artist, and singer.<ref name="WVobit">Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', February 22, 1984.</ref> Known primarily for her distinctive, powerful voice and leading roles in [[musical theatre]], she has been called "the undisputed First Lady of the musical comedy stage".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.musicals101.com/mermbio.htm|title=Merman 101: Ethel Merman Biography - Part I|website=Musicals101.com|access-date=September 28, 2021}}</ref> Over her distinguished career in theater she became known for her iconic performances in shows such as ''[[Anything Goes]]'', ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'', ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]'', and ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]''.  

She is also known for her film roles in ''[[Anything Goes (1936 film)|Anything Goes]]'' (1936), ''[[Call Me Madam (film)|Call Me Madam]]'' (1953), ''[[There's No Business Like Show Business (film)|There's No Business Like Show Business]]'' (1954), and ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963). Among many accolades, she received the [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical]] for her performance in ''[[Call Me Madam]]'', a [[Grammy Award]] for ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]'' and [[Drama Desk Award]] for ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]''.

Among the many standards introduced by Merman in [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Musical theatre|musicals]] are "[[I Got Rhythm]]" (from ''[[Girl Crazy]]''); "[[Everything's Coming Up Roses]]", "Some People", and "[[Rose's Turn]]" (from ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]''—Merman starred as Rose in the original 1959 Broadway production); and the [[Cole Porter]] songs "[[It's De-Lovely]]" (from ''[[Red, Hot and Blue]]''), "Friendship" (from ''[[Du Barry Was a Lady]]''), and "[[I Get a Kick Out of You]]", "[[You're the Top]]", and "[[Anything Goes (Cole Porter song)|Anything Goes]]" (from ''[[Anything Goes]]''). The [[Irving Berlin]] song "[[There's No Business Like Show Business]]", written for the musical ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'', became Merman's signature song.

==Early life==
Merman was born in her maternal grandmother's house at 359 4th Avenue (today 33rd Street just off 36th Avenue) in [[Astoria, Queens]] in New York City in 1908, but later insisted that the year was 1912.<ref>Kellow, Brian, ''Ethel Merman: A Life''. New York: Viking Press 2007. {{ISBN|0-670-01829-5}}, p. 2.</ref> Her father, Edward Zimmermann (1879–1977), was an accountant with James H. Dunham & Company, a Manhattan wholesale dry-goods company, and her mother, Agnes (Gardner) Zimmermann (1883–1974), was a teacher. Edward Zimmermann had been raised in the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] and his wife was [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]. Shortly after they married, they joined the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] congregation at Church of the Redeemer, where their daughter was baptized. Merman's parents were strict about church attendance and she spent every Sunday attending morning services, Sunday school, afternoon prayer meetings, and evening study groups for children.<ref>Kellow, pp. 2–4.</ref> 

Merman attended P.S. 4 and [[William Cullen Bryant High School]] (which later named its auditorium in her honor), where she pursued a commercial course that offered secretarial training.<ref>Kellow, pp. 4–7.</ref> She was active in numerous extracurricular activities, including the school magazine, the speakers' club, and student council, and she frequented the local music store to peruse the weekly arrivals of new sheet music.<ref>Kellow, p. 7.</ref> On Friday nights, the Zimmermann family took the subway into Manhattan to see the [[vaudeville]] show at the [[Palace Theatre (Broadway)|Palace Theatre]], where Merman saw [[Blossom Seeley]], [[Fanny Brice]], [[Sophie Tucker]], and [[Nora Bayes]]. At home, she tried to emulate their singing styles, but her own distinctive voice was difficult to disguise.<ref>Kellow, p. 6.</ref>

After graduating from Bryant High School in 1924, Merman was hired as a [[stenographer]] by the Boyce-Ite Company. One day during her lunch break, she met [[Victor William Kliesrath|Vic Kliesrath]], who offered her a job at the [[Bragg-Kliesrath Corporation]] for a $5 increase above the weekly $23 salary she was earning, and Merman accepted the offer.<ref name="Ethel Merman a Life" /> She eventually was made personal secretary to company president [[Caleb Bragg]], whose frequent lengthy absences from the office to race automobiles allowed her to catch up on the sleep she had lost the previous night when she was out late performing at private parties.<ref name="Ethel Merman a Life">{{cite book|last=Kellow|first=Brian|title=Ethel Merman : a life|year=2008|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=9780143114208|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OJK5VL5dr8IC&q=Bragg-Kliesrath+brake&pg=PT24}}</ref> During this period, Merman also began appearing in [[nightclub]]s, first hired by [[Jimmy Durante]]'s partner [[Lou Clayton]]. At this time, she decided the name Ethel Zimmermann was too long for a theater marquee. She considered combining Ethel with Gardner or Hunter, which was her grandmother's maiden name. These considerations caused her father's ire, and she abbreviated Zimmermann to Merman to appease her father.<ref>Kellow, pp. 8–13.</ref>

==Career==

===Early career===
During a two-week engagement at a club in midtown Manhattan called Little Russia, Merman met agent Lou Irwin, who arranged for her to audition for [[Archie Mayo]], a film director under contract at [[Warner Bros.]] He offered her an exclusive six-month contract, starting at $125 per week, and Merman quit her day job, only to find herself idle for weeks while waiting to be cast in a film. She finally urged Irwin to try to cancel her agreement with Mayo; instead, he negotiated her a better deal allowing her to perform in clubs while remaining on the Warners payroll. Merman was hired as a [[torch song|torch singer]] at Les Ambassadeurs, where the headliner was [[Jimmy Durante]], and the two became lifelong friends. She caught the attention of columnists such as [[Walter Winchell]] and [[Mark Hellinger]], who began giving her publicity. Soon after, Merman underwent a [[tonsillectomy]] she feared might damage her voice, but after recovering, she discovered it was more powerful than ever.<ref>Kellow, pp. 13–19.</ref>

While performing on the prestigious [[Benjamin Franklin Keith|Keith Circuit]], Merman was signed to replace [[Ruth Etting]] in the [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] film ''[[Follow the Leader (1930 film)|Follow the Leader]]'' (1930), starring [[Ed Wynn]] and [[Ginger Rogers]]. Following a successful seven-week run at the [[Paramount Theatre (Brooklyn, New York)|Brooklyn Paramount]], she was signed to perform at the Palace for $500 per week. During the run, theatre producer [[Vinton Freedley]] saw her perform and invited her to audition for the role of San Francisco café singer Kate Fothergill in the new [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]] musical ''[[Girl Crazy]]''. Upon hearing her sing "I Got Rhythm", the Gershwins immediately cast her, and Merman began juggling daytime rehearsals with her matinee and evening performance schedule at the Palace.<ref>Kellow, pp. 21–26.</ref> Merman introduced the songs "[[Sam and Delilah]]" and "[[Boy! What Love Has Done to Me!]]" as well as "I Got Rhythm" in the show.<ref name="Furia1997">{{cite book|last=Furia|first=Philip|title=Ira Gershwin : the art of the lyricist|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1997|isbn=978-0-19-535394-5|oclc=1074289846|page=77}}</ref>

''Girl Crazy'' opened on October 14, 1930, at the [[Neil Simon Theatre|Alvin Theatre]], where it ran for 272 performances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=11231|title=Girl Crazy – Broadway Musical – Original - IBDB|first=The Broadway|last=League}}</ref> ''The New York Times'' noted Merman sang "with dash, authority, good voice and just the right knowing style", and ''The New Yorker'' called her "imitative of no one."<ref name="Kellow, p. 30">Kellow, p. 30.</ref> Merman was fairly blasé about her notices, prompting George Gershwin to ask her mother "Have you ever seen a person so unconcerned as Ethel?"

[[File:Ethel merman ragtime9.jpg|thumb|left|Ethel Merman with [[Tyrone Power]] in the trailer for ''[[Alexander's Ragtime Band (film)|Alexander's Ragtime Band]]'']]

During the run of ''Girl Crazy'', Paramount signed Merman to appear in a series of 10 short musical films, most of which allowed her to sing a rousing number as well as a ballad. She also performed at the Central Park Casino, the [[Paramount Theatre (New York City)|Paramount Theatre]], and a return engagement at the Palace. As soon as ''Girl Crazy'' closed, her parents and she departed for a much-needed vacation in [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]] in Upstate New York, but after their first day there, Merman was summoned to Atlantic City, New Jersey to help salvage the troubled latest edition of ''[[George White's Scandals]]''. Because she was still under contract to Freedley, White was forced to pay the producer $10,000 for her services, in addition to her weekly $1,500 salary. Following the Atlantic City run, the show played in Newark, New Jersey and then Brooklyn before opening on Broadway, where it ran for 202 performances.<ref>Kellow, pp. 32–37.</ref>

Merman's next show, ''Humpty Dumpty'', began rehearsals in August 1932 and opened—and immediately closed—in Pittsburgh the following month. Producer [[Buddy DeSylva]], who also had written the book and lyrics, was certain it could be reworked into a success, and with a revamped script and additional songs by [[Vincent Youmans]],<ref>Kellow, pp. 37–40.</ref> it opened with the new title ''[[Take a Chance (1932 musical)|Take a Chance]]'' on November 26 at the 42nd Street Apollo Theatre, where it ran for 243 performances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=11687|title=Take a Chance – Broadway Musical – Original - IBDB|first=The Broadway|last=League}}</ref> [[Brooks Atkinson]] of ''The New York Times'' called it "fast, loud, and funny" and added Merman "has never loosed herself with quite so much abandon." Following the Broadway run, she agreed to join the show on the road, but shortly after the Chicago opening, she claimed the chlorine in the city's water supply was irritating her throat, and returned to Manhattan.<ref name="Kellow, p. 30"/>

Merman returned to Hollywood to appear in ''[[We're Not Dressing]]'' (1934), a [[screwball comedy]] based on the [[J.M. Barrie]] play ''[[The Admirable Crichton]]''. Despite working with a cast including [[Bing Crosby]], [[Carole Lombard]], and [[Burns and Allen]], under the direction of [[Academy Award for Best Director|Academy Award]]–winning director [[Norman Taurog]], Merman was unhappy with the experience, and she was dismayed to discover one of her musical numbers had been cut when she attended the New York opening with her family and friends. She also appeared on screen with [[Eddie Cantor]] in ''[[Kid Millions]]'' (also 1934), but her return to Broadway established her as a major star and cemented her image as a tough girl.<ref>Kellow, pp. 42–67.</ref>

''[[Anything Goes]]'' proved to be the first of five [[Cole Porter]] musicals in which Merman starred. In addition to the title song, the score included "[[I Get a Kick Out of You]]", "[[You're the Top]]", and "Blow Gabriel Blow". It opened on November 21, 1934, at the Alvin Theatre,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=9382|title=Anything Goes – Broadway Musical – Original - IBDB|first=The Broadway|last=League}}</ref> and the ''New York Post'' called Merman "vivacious and ingratiating in her comedy moments, and the embodiment of poise and technical adroitness" when singing "as only she knows how to do." Although Merman always had remained with a show until the end of its run, she left ''Anything Goes'' after eight months to appear with Eddie Cantor in the film ''[[Strike Me Pink (film)|Strike Me Pink]]''. She was replaced by [[Benay Venuta]], with whom she enjoyed a long but frequently tempestuous friendship.<ref>Kellow, pp. 55–57.</ref>

Merman initially was overlooked for the film version of ''[[Anything Goes (1936 film)|Anything Goes]]'' (1936). Bing Crosby insisted his wife [[Dixie Lee]] be cast as Reno Sweeney opposite his Billy Crocker, but when she unexpectedly dropped out of the project, Merman was cast in the role she had originated on stage. From the beginning, it was clear to Merman the film would not be the enjoyable experience she had hoped it would be. The focus was shifted to Crosby, leaving her very much in a supporting role. Many of Porter's ribald lyrics were altered to conform to the guidelines of the [[Motion Picture Production Code]], and "Blow Gabriel Blow" was eliminated completely, replaced by a song, "Shang Hai-de-Ho", that Merman was forced to perform in a headdress made of peacock feathers while surrounded by dancers dressed as Chinese slave girls. The film was completed $201,000 over budget and 17 days behind schedule. [[Richard Watts Jr.]] of the ''New York Herald Tribune'' described it as "dull and commonplace", with Merman doing "as well as possible", but unable to register "on screen as magnificently as she does on stage."<ref>Kellow, pp. 57–59.</ref>

[[File:EthelMermanNoBusinesstrailer.jpg|thumb|right|In the film trailer for ''[[There's No Business Like Show Business (film)|There's No Business Like Show Business]]'' (1954)]]

Merman returned to Broadway for another Porter musical, but despite the presence of Jimmy Durante and [[Bob Hope]] in the cast, ''[[Red, Hot and Blue]]'' closed after less than six months.<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=12157 ''Red, Hot and Blue''] at the Internet Broadway Database</ref> Back in Hollywood, Merman was featured in ''[[Happy Landing (1938 film)|Happy Landing]]'', one of the top 10 box-office hits of 1938 comedy with [[Sonja Henie]], [[Cesar Romero]] and [[Don Ameche]]; another the box-office hit ''[[Alexander's Ragtime Band (film)|Alexander's Ragtime Band]]'', a pastiche of [[Irving Berlin]] songs interpolated into a plot that vaguely paralleled the composer's life; and ''[[Straight Place and Show]]'', a critical and commercial flop starring the [[Ritz Brothers]].<ref>Kellow, pp. 69–71.</ref> She returned to the stage in ''Stars in Your Eyes'', which struggled to survive while the public flocked to the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] instead, and finally closed short of four months.<ref>Kellow, p. 75.</ref> Merman followed this with two more Porter musicals. ''[[DuBarry Was a Lady]]'', with [[Bert Lahr]] and [[Betty Grable]], ran for a year,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=1024|title=Du Barry Was a Lady – Broadway Musical – Original - IBDB|first=The Broadway|last=League}}</ref> and ''[[Panama Hattie]]'', with [[Betty Hutton]] (whose musical numbers were cut from the show on opening night at Merman's insistence), [[June Allyson]], and [[Arthur Treacher]], fared even better, lasting slightly more than 14 months.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/panama-hattie-1028|title=Panama Hattie – Broadway Musical – Original|website=IBDb.com}}</ref>

Shortly after the opening of the latter, Merman—still despondent about the end of her affair with [[Stork Club]] owner [[Sherman Billingsley]]—married her first husband, Treacher's agent, William Smith. She later said she knew on their wedding night she had made "a dreadful mistake," and two months later, she filed for divorce on grounds of desertion.<ref>Kellow, pp. 87–89.</ref> Shortly after she met and married Robert D. Levitt, promotion director for the ''[[New York Journal-American]]''. The couple eventually had two children and divorced in 1952 because of his excessive drinking and erratic behavior.<ref>Kellow, pp. 136–137, 142–143.</ref>

In 1943, Merman was a featured performer in the film ''[[Stage Door Canteen (film)|Stage Door Canteen]]'' and opened in another Porter musical, ''[[Something for the Boys]]'', produced by [[Mike Todd|Michael Todd]]. In 1944, Merman was set to star as the title character in the musical play ''[[Sadie Thompson (musical)|Sadie Thompson]]'' with a score by [[Vernon Duke]] and [[Howard Dietz]], directed and produced by [[Rouben Mamoulian]]. The musical play was based on the short story "[[Rain (short story)|Rain]]" by [[W. Somerset Maugham]].<ref>Kellow, Brian (2007).  ''Ethel Merman:  A Life''. Viking Press, pp.104-105.</ref> The serious nature of the production was a departure from Merman’s string of successful musical comedies.<ref>Kellow, Brian (2007).  ''Ethel Merman:  A Life''. Viking Press, (Kellow) pp.104-105.</ref> Moreover, during rehearsals, Merman had difficulties memorizing the lyrics, and she blamed Dietz for his use of sophisticated and foreign words.<ref name="Kellow, pp.104-105">Kellow, pp.104-105</ref>  She had her husband tone down some of the lyrics.<ref name="Kellow, pp.104-105"/> Dietz took exception to Merman’s singing the altered lyrics and gave her an ultimatum to sing his original lyrics or leave the show.<ref name="Kellow, p. 105">Kellow, p. 105</ref> In response, Merman withdrew from the production.<ref name="Kellow, p. 105"/> Commentators have speculated that Merman's departure was probably due to her reluctance to assume such a serious role in her first dramatic musical.<ref>I Like the Likes of Duke (v "Sadie Thompson" (11/16/44 - 01/06/45)), That’s Entertainment (September 7, 2015) jacksonhupperco.com/tag/june-havoc, accessed on September 9, 2020; Mordden, Ethan (1999)  ''Beautiful Mornin’:  The Broadway Musical in the 1940s''.

In August 1945, while in the hospital recovering from the [[Caesarean section|Caesarean birth]] of her second child, Merman was visited by [[Dorothy Fields]], who proposed she star as [[Annie Oakley]] in a musical her brother [[Herbert Fields|Herbert]] and she were writing with [[Jerome Kern]]. Merman accepted, but in November, Kern suffered a stroke while in New York City visiting Rodgers and Hammerstein (the producers of the show) and died a few days later. [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] invited [[Irving Berlin]] to replace him,<ref>Kellow, pp. 107.</ref> and the result was ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'', which opened on May 16, 1946 at the [[Imperial Theatre (Broadway)|Imperial Theatre]], where it ran for nearly three years and 1,147 performances.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/annie-get-your-gun-1440|title=Annie Get Your Gun – Broadway Musical – Original|website=IBDb.com}}</ref> During this time, Merman took only two vacations and missed only two performances because of illness.<ref>Kellow, p. 116.</ref> Merman lost the film version to [[Judy Garland]], who eventually was replaced by Betty Hutton, but she did star in a Broadway revival two decades later at [[Lincoln Center]] with [[Bruce Yarnell]], who was 27 years Merman's junior, cast as [[Frank E. Butler]], Annie Oakley's loyal husband and manager.

Merman and Berlin reunited for ''[[Call Me Madam]]'' in 1950, for which she won the [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical]], and she starred in the [[Call Me Madam (film)|1953 screen adaptation]] as well, winning the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] for her performance. The following year, she appeared as the matriarch of the singing and dancing Donahue family in ''[[There's No Business Like Show Business (film)|There's No Business Like Show Business]]'', a film with a Berlin score.

Merman returned to Broadway at the behest of her third husband, [[Continental Airlines]] executive [[Robert Six]], who was upset she had chosen to become a housewife in Colorado following their wedding in 1953. He expected her public appearances to engender publicity for the airline, and her decision to forgo the limelight did not sit well with him. He urged her to accept the lead in ''[[Happy Hunting]]'', with a book by [[Howard Lindsay]] and [[Russel Crouse]] (who had written ''Call Me Madam'') and a score by the unknown team of Harold Karr and Matt Dubey. Merman acquiesced to her husband's demands, although she clashed with the composers from the start and soon was at odds with co-star [[Fernando Lamas]] and his wife [[Arlene Dahl]], who frequently attended rehearsals. Based on the Merman name, the show opened in New York with an advance sale of $1.5 million, and despite the star's dissatisfaction with it, garnered respectable reviews. Although Brooks Atkinson thought the score was "hardly more than adequate", he called Merman "as brassy as ever, glowing like a neon light whenever she steps on the stage." Several months into the run, she insisted that two of her least-favorite numbers be replaced by songs written by her friend [[Roger Edens]], who, because of his exclusive contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], credited them to [[Kay Thompson]]. She lost the Tony Award to [[Judy Holliday]] in ''[[Bells Are Ringing (musical)|Bells Are Ringing]]'', and the show closed after 412 performances, with Merman happy to see what she considered "a dreary obligation" finally come to an end.<ref>Kellow, pp. 160–169.</ref>

===Later career===
''[[Gypsy: A Musical Fable|Gypsy]]'' was based on the memoirs of [[Gypsy Rose Lee]] and starred Merman as her domineering [[stage mother]] [[Rose Thompson Hovick|Rose Hovick]], possibly Merman's best-remembered performance. The musical opened on May 21, 1959, at [[The Broadway Theatre]]. In the ''New York Post,'' Richard Watts called Merman "a brilliant actress," and Brooks Atkinson of ''The New York Times'' wrote that "She gives an indomitable performance, both as actress and singer." Despite the acclaim, Merman lost the [[Tony Award]] to her close friend [[Mary Martin]] in ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' and jokingly quipped "How are you going to buck a nun?" Shortly after she divorced Robert Six, his affair with television actress [[Audrey Meadows]] became public, and she found solace in her work.<ref>Kellow, pp. 174&ndash;188</ref>

Throughout the 702-performance run of ''Gypsy,'' [[Mervyn LeRoy]] saw it numerous times, and repeatedly assured Merman that he planned to cast her in the film adaptation he was preparing. However, before the show's closing, it was announced that [[Rosalind Russell]] instead had been signed to star. Russell's husband, [[theatre producer]] Frederick Brisson (whom Merman later called "the lizard of Roz"),<ref>{{Cite book|title=Brass Diva: The Life and Legends of Ethel Merman|last=Flinn|first=Caryl|publisher=University of Carlifornia Press|year=2009|isbn=9780520260221|location=Berkeley|pages=311|oclc=264039481}}</ref> had sold the screen rights to the Leonard Spigelgass play ''[[A Majority of One]]'' to [[Warner Bros.]] with the stipulation his wife would star in both films. Because Russell was still a major box-office draw with the success of ''[[Auntie Mame (film)|Auntie Mame]]'' a few years earlier, and Merman never having established herself as a popular screen presence, the studio agreed to Brisson's terms. Merman was devastated at this turn of events and called the loss of the role "the greatest professional disappointment of my life."<ref>Kellow, Brian, pp. 173&ndash;195</ref>

Following the Broadway closing of ''Gypsy'' on March 25, 1961, Merman half-heartedly embarked on the national tour. In San Francisco, she severely injured her back, but continued to play to packed houses. During the Los Angeles run, LeRoy visited her backstage and claimed Russell was so ill that "I think you're going to end up getting this part." Believing the film version of ''Gypsy'' was within her grasp, she generously gave him the many house seats he requested for friends and industry colleagues, only to discover she had been duped.<ref>Kellow, pp. 191&ndash;192</ref> During her run in ''Gypsy'', Merman earned an estimated $130,000 per year in the role plus 10% of the box-office receipts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1996/01/04/Broadway-pay-rises-Hollywood-style/6842820731600/|title=Broadway pay rises -- Hollywood style|website=Upi.com|access-date=October 6, 2019}}</ref>

[[File:Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World Trailer4.jpg|thumb|270px|Left to right: [[Edie Adams]], [[Sid Caesar]], [[Jonathan Winters]], Ethel Merman, [[Milton Berle]], [[Mickey Rooney]] and [[Buddy Hackett]]]]
In 1963, Merman starred in the ensemble comedy film ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' alongside [[Spencer Tracy]], [[Sid Caesar]], [[Jonathan Winters]], [[Phil Silvers]], [[Buddy Hackett]], and [[Mickey Rooney]]. Merman played Mrs. Marcus, the loudmouthed, battle-axe mother in-law of [[Milton Berle]]. The film was a major box office success earning $60 million off a budget of $9.4 million, becoming the [[1963 in film|3rd highest-grossing film of 1963]]. The film received 6 [[Academy Award]] nominations and 1 win.

She also starred in the flop ''[[The Art of Love (1965 film)|The Art of Love]]'' (1965). She made dozens of television appearances on variety series hosted by [[Perry Como]], [[Red Skelton]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Ed Sullivan]], and [[Carol Burnett]], talk shows with [[Mike Douglas]], [[Dick Cavett]], and [[Merv Griffin]], and in episodes of ''[[That Girl]]'', ''[[The Lucy Show]],'' ''[[Match Game]]'', ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]],'' ''[[Tarzan (1966 TV series)|Tarzan]],'' and others.

Producer [[David Merrick]] encouraged [[Jerry Herman]] to compose ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' specifically for Merman's vocal range, but when he offered her the role, she declined it. She finally joined the cast on March 28, 1970, six years after the production opened. On Merman's opening night, her performance was continually brought to a halt by prolonged standing ovations, and the critics unanimously heralded her return to the New York stage. [[Walter Kerr]] in ''The New York Times'' described her voice: "Exactly as trumpet-clean, exactly as penny whistle-piercing, exactly as Wurlitzer-wonderful as it always was." He wrote: "Her comic sense is every bit as authoritative, as high-handed, really, as her voice."<ref>Kerr, Walter.[https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/12/archives/merman-a-kid-who-wins-all-the-marbles-merman-wins.html?sq=%2522Ethel+Merman%2522&scp=1&st=p "Merman: A Kid Who Wins All the Marbles; Merman Wins"] ''The New York Times'' (abstract), April 12, 1970, p.D1</ref> The seventh actress to portray the scheming matchmaker in the original Broadway production, she remained with the musical for 210 performances until it closed on December 27, 1970. Merman received the [[Drama Desk Award]] for Outstanding Performance for what proved to be her last appearance on Broadway.

For the remainder of her career, Merman worked as frequently as offers were made. In 1979, she recorded ''[[The Ethel Merman Disco Album]],'' with many of her signature songs are set to a [[disco]] beat. She was a guest host on a memorable episode in season 1 of The Muppet Show. Her last screen role was a self-parody in the 1980 comedy film ''[[Airplane!]],'' in which she portrayed Lieutenant Hurwitz, a shell-shocked soldier who thinks he is Ethel Merman. In the cameo appearance, Merman leaps out of bed singing "[[Everything's Coming Up Roses]]" as orderlies sedate her. She also appeared in several episodes of ''[[The Love Boat]]'' (playing Gopher's mother), guest-starred on a CBS tribute to George Gershwin, did a summer comedy/concert tour with [[Carroll O'Connor]], played a two-week engagement at the [[London Palladium]], performed with Mary Martin in a concert benefiting the theatre and museum collection of the [[Museum of the City of New York]], and frequently appeared as a soloist with symphony orchestras. She also volunteered at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center (now [[Mount Sinai West (hospital)|Mount Sinai West]]) working in the gift shop or visiting patients.

===Performance style===
Merman was known for her powerful, [[Vocal belting|belting]] [[mezzo-soprano]] voice and precise [[enunciation]] and pitch.<ref>{{cite web|

Broadway lore holds that George Gershwin advised her never to take a singing lesson after she opened in his ''Girl Crazy''.<ref>Flinn, Caryl. ''Brass Diva: The Life and Legends of Ethel Merman'' (2007), p. 33, University of California Press, {{ISBN|0-520-26022-8}}</ref>

Caryl Flinn's 2007 biography includes many quotes from reviews of Merman's work, most of which were compliments to her. [[Brooks Atkinson]] summed up her talent:<ref name="flinn120">Flinn 2007 p. 120</ref>
{{Quotation|She makes a song seem like a spontaneous expression of her personality, which may be regarded as the ultimate skill in the art of singing songs}}

===Profanity===
Merman was notorious for her brash demeanor and for telling vulgar stories at public parties. For instance, she once shouted a dirty joke across the room at [[José Ferrer]] during a formal reception.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/bob-thomas-7/i-got-rhythm-the-ethel-merman-story/|title=I GOT RHYTHM!

While rehearsing a guest appearance on ''[[The Loretta Young Show]],'' Merman exclaimed "Where the hell does this go?" [[Loretta Young|Young]], who was a devout Catholic, advanced towards her waving an empty coffee [[Swear jar|can]], saying "Come on, Ethel. You know my rules. That'll cost you a dollar." To which Merman replied "Tell me, Loretta, how much will it cost me to tell you to go fuck yourself?"<ref>{{cite book|title=Ethel Merman: The Biggest Star on Broadway|first=Geoffrey|last=Mark|publisher=Barricade Legend|year=2006|isbn=9781569802939|page=[https://archive.org/details/ethelmermanbigge0000mark/page/66 66]|url=https://archive.org/details/ethelmermanbigge0000mark/page/66}}</ref>

===Politics===
Merman, a lifelong [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], was a frequent guest at the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] [[The White House|White House]].<ref>Flinn 2007 p. 177</ref> Merman was also noted as saying, "Eisenhower was my war hero and the President I admire and respect most."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/e/ethelmerma314679.html|title=Ethel Merman Quotes|website=BrainyQuote.com|access-date=December 10, 2017}}</ref> On January 20, 1981, Merman performed at the inauguration of [[Ronald Reagan]] singing "Everything's Coming up Roses".

==Autobiographies==
Merman co-wrote two memoirs. The first, ''Who Could Ask for Anything More?'' (1955), was published by Doubleday & Co.  and written with the assistance of Pete Martin.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&dat=19550717&id=iElSAAAAIBAJ&pg=3831,821311|title=With Ethel - Anything Goes!|date=July 17, 1955|work=St. Petersburg Times|page=12|access-date=September 20, 2014}}</ref> The second, ''Merman'' (1978), was published by Simon & Schuster and written with George Eels.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19780702&id=m8McAAAAIBAJ&pg=4276,587429|title=Fans Find 'Merman' For Them|last=Apone|first=Carl|date=July 2, 1978|work=The Pittsburgh Press|pages=H–6|access-date=September 20, 2014}}</ref>

==Later life and death==
Merman began to become forgetful with advancing age, and on occasion, had difficulty with her speech. At times her behavior was erratic, causing concern among her friends. On April 7, 1983, she was preparing to travel to Los Angeles to appear on the [[55th Academy Awards]] telecast, when she collapsed in her apartment. Merman was taken to Roosevelt Hospital ([[Mount Sinai West (hospital)|Mount Sinai West]]) where doctors initially thought she had suffered a [[stroke]]. However, after undergoing exploratory surgery on April 11, Merman was diagnosed with stage 4 [[glioblastoma]].<ref name="flinn410">Flinn 2007 p. 410</ref> ''The New York Times'' reported that she underwent brain surgery to have the tumor removed, but it was inoperable and her condition was deemed terminal (doctors gave Merman eight and a half months to live).<ref name="flinn410"/><ref name="kellow262">Kellow 2007 p. 262</ref> The tumor caused Merman to become [[Aphasia|aphasic]], and as her illness progressed, she lost her hair and her face swelled.<ref name="flinn411">Flinn 2007 p. 411</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Mark|first=Geoffrey|title=Ethel Merman: The Biggest Star on Broadway|year=2006|publisher=Barricade Legend|isbn=1-569-80293-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/ethelmermanbigge0000mark/page/204 204]|url=https://archive.org/details/ethelmermanbigge0000mark/page/204}}</ref> According to Merman biographer Brian Kellow, Merman's family and manager did not want the true nature of her condition revealed to the public.<ref name="kellow262"/> Merman's son Robert Jr., who took charge of her care, later said he chose not to publicly disclose his mother's true condition because Merman strove to keep her personal life private. He stated "Mom truly appreciated [her fans'] presence and their applause. But you shouldn't attempt to be personal—she drew lines, and she could cut you off."<ref name="flinn411"/>

Merman's health eventually stabilized enough for her to be brought back to her apartment in Manhattan. On February 15, 1984, 10 months after she was diagnosed with brain cancer, Merman died at her home in Manhattan at the age of 76.<ref name="reading">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat=19840216&id=xPoxAAAAIBAJ&pg=4019,4359264|title=Fans Mourn death of Ethel Merman|date=February 16, 1984|work=Reading Eagle|page=53|access-date=September 20, 2014}}</ref> On the evening of Merman's death, all 36 theatres on Broadway dimmed their lights at 9 pm in her honor.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=110&dat=19840216&id=ZJtaAAAAIBAJ&pg=5278,2841594|title=Broadway Lights Dimmed To Honor Ethel Merman|date=February 16, 1984|work=Ludington Daily News|page=3|access-date=September 21, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Parish|first1=James Robert |last2=Pitts|first2=Michael R.|title=Hollywood Songsters: Garland to O'Connor|year=2003|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=0-415-94333-7|page=572}}</ref> A private funeral service for Merman was held in a chapel at [[St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church, New York|St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church]] on February 27, after which Merman was cremated at the [[Frank E.

Upon her death, Merman left an estate estimated to be worth US$1.5 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|1.5|1984|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}) to be divided between her son and two grandchildren.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/wherethereswillw0000silv|title=Where there's a will-- : who inherited what and why|first=Stephen M.|last=Silverman|date=February 25, 1991|publisher=New York, N.Y. : HarperCollins|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

On October 10, 1984, an auction of her personal effects, including furniture, artwork, and theatre memorabilia, earned in excess of $120,000 ({{Inflation|US|120000|1984|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) at [[Christie's|Christie's East]].<ref>Kellow, pp. 261–266</ref> The [[56th Academy Awards]], held on April 2, 1984, ended with a performance of "There's No Business Like Show Business" in tribute to Merman.
