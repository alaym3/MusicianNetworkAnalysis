==Early life and education==
Cockburn was born in 1945 in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], and spent some time at his grandfather's farm outside of [[Chelsea, Quebec]], but he grew up in [[Westboro, Ottawa|Westboro]], which was a suburb of Ottawa when he was a teenager. His father, Doug Cockburn, was a [[radiologist]], eventually becoming head of diagnostic x-ray at the [[Ottawa Civic Hospital]].<ref>Cockburn, pp. 5,8 & 12</ref> He has stated in interviews that his first guitar was one he found around 1959 in his grandmother's attic, which he adorned with golden stars and used to play along to radio hits.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://canada.aol.com/webcentres/community/chats/archive.adp?guest=Bruce_Cockburn |title=AOL.ca – Canada's Breaking News, Entertainment, Music, Life & Style and Email |website= canada.aol.com |date=September 29, 2009 |access-date=April 17, 2014}}</ref> This was replaced when his parents bought him a [[Kay Musical Instrument Company|Kay]] [[archtop guitar|archtop]] that had flat wound strings and a [[DeArmond]] pickup after his first guitar teacher, Hank Sims, declared it unplayable.<ref>Cockburn, p. 24</ref>

Later he was taught piano and music theory by Peter Hall, the organist at Westboro United Church which Cockburn and his family attended. Cockburn had been listening to jazz and wanted to learn musical composition. Hall encouraged him and, along with his friend Bob Lamble, a lot of time was spent at Hall's house listening to and discussing jazz.<ref>Cockburn, p. 36</ref>

Cockburn attended [[Nepean High School (Ottawa)|Nepean High School]], where his 1964 yearbook photo states his desire "to become a musician".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cockburnproject.net/bio.html |title=Bruce Cockburn – Bio |publisher=Cockburnproject.net |access-date=April 17, 2014}}</ref> Nepean's music teacher at the time, [[Ronald E.J. Milne]], said in 1988 that although Cockburn didn't take music, he could often be seen playing guitar.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} After graduating, he took a boat to Europe and [[street performance|busked]] in Paris.<ref>Zwerin, Mike. "Bruce Cockburn, a Canadian Secret." ''International Herald Tribune'', 1 Sept. 1999, p. 11. ''Gale Power Search''. Accessed June 5, 2018.</ref>

Cockburn attended [[Berklee College of Music|Berklee School of Music]] in Boston, where his studies included jazz composition, for three semesters between 1964 and 1966. That year he dropped out and joined an Ottawa band called The Children, which lasted for about a year.

==Career==
===Early career===
In early 1967 he joined the final lineup of [[The Esquires (Canadian band)|the Esquires]]. He moved to [[Toronto]] that summer to form [[The Flying Circus (Canada)|The Flying Circus]] with Marty Fisher and Gordon MacBain, former [[Bobby Kris & The Imperials]] members, and Neil Lillie, ex-[[The Tripp|Tripp]] member. The group recorded some material in late 1967 (which remains unreleased) before changing its name to Olivus in the spring of 1968, by which time Lillie (who changed his name to [[Neil Merryweather]]) had been replaced by Dennis Pendrith from Livingstone's Journey. Olivus opened for [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]] and [[Cream (band)|Cream]] in April 1968.<ref>Cockburn, pp. 89, 93 & 94</ref> That summer Cockburn broke up the band with the intention of going solo, but ended up in the band [[3's a Crowd (band)|3's a Crowd]] with [[David Wiffen]], [[Colleen Peterson]], and Richard Patterson, who had been a co-member of The Children. Cockburn left [[3's a Crowd (band)|3's a Crowd]] in the spring of 1969 to pursue a solo career.

Cockburn's first solo appearance was at the [[Mariposa Folk Festival]] in 1967, and in 1969 he was a headliner.<ref>Cockburn, pp. 100-101</ref> In 1970 he released his self-titled, solo album. A single, "Going to the Country", appeared on the RPM Top 50 Canadian Chart.<ref>[http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/item.aspx?IdNumber=2507& "Top 50 Canadian Chart"]. ''RPM Magazine'', Canadian Content, – Volume 13, No. 23 July 25, 1970</ref>

Cockburn's guitar work and songwriting won him an enthusiastic following. His early work featured rural and nautical imagery and Biblical metaphors. Raised as an [[agnostic]], early in his career he became a [[Christians|Christian]].<ref>"I was brought up as an agnostic … and when I first became a Christian in the Seventies I didn't really know what it was I'd adopted." [http://cockburnproject.net/issues/personal/christianity.html Faith in Practice: Holding on to the Mystery of Love], by Bruce Cockburn as told to Cole Morton, Third Way, September 1994, page 15.</ref> Many of his albums from the 1970s refer to Christian themes, which in turn inform his concerns for [[human rights]] and [[environmentalism]]. His references to Christianity include the Grail imagery of 20th-century Christian poet [[Charles Williams (British writer)|Charles Williams]] and the ideas of theologian [[Harvey Cox]].<ref>Adria, Marco, "Making Contact with Bruce Cockburn", ''Music of Our Times: Eight Canadian Singer-Songwriters'' (Toronto: Lorimer, 1990), p. 97.</ref>

In 1970 Cockburn became partners with Bernie Finkelstein in the music publishing firm Golden Mountain Music.<ref>{{cite journal| last= McPherson| first= David| title= Bernie Finkelstein's Golden Mountain| journal= Words and Music| date= Fall 2012}}</ref> He won the Juno, for Canadian Folksinger of the Year, three years in a row, 1971–73.<ref>Cockburn, p. 121</ref> He was nominated for Canadian Folksinger of the Year and Male Vocalist of the Year at the 1974 Juno Awards.<ref>{{cite book|title=Juno Award Nominations Listed|work=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vAcEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA54|date=9 March 1974|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=54}}</ref>

While Cockburn had been popular in Canada for years, he did not have a big impact in the United States until 1979, with the release of the album ''[[Dancing in the Dragon's Jaws]]''. The album's first single, "[[Wondering Where the Lions Are]]", reached No. 21 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the US in June 1980, earning Cockburn an appearance on [[NBC]]'s TV show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.  Cockburn's label, True North Records, also signed a distribution deal with Recordi Records in Italy.<ref name= "Inc.1979">{{cite book|title=Cockburn Push|work=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8yMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT89|date=June 2, 1979|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.| pages= 89– |issn= 0006-2510}}</ref>

===1980s and 1990s===
Through the 1980s Cockburn's songwriting became increasingly urban, global and political as he became more involved with progressive causes. His political concerns were first hinted at on the albums: ''Humans'', ''Inner City Front'' and ''The Trouble with Normal''. They became more evident in 1984, with his second US radio hit, "[[If I Had a Rocket Launcher]]" (No. 88 in the US<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1985-02-16|title=Billboard Hot 100: February 16, 1985|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=February 13, 2021}}</ref>) from the ''[[Stealing Fire (Bruce Cockburn album)|Stealing Fire]]'' album. He had written the song a year earlier, after visiting Guatemalan refugee camps in Mexico that were attacked by Guatemalan military helicopters. His political activism continues to the present. His internationalist bent is reflected in the many [[world music]] influences in his music, including [[reggae]] and [[Latin American music|Latin music]].

In 1991 [[Intrepid Records (Canada)|Intrepid Records]] released ''[[Kick at the Darkness]]'', a tribute album to Cockburn whose title comes from a phrase in his song "[[Lovers in a Dangerous Time]]". It features the [[Barenaked Ladies]]' cover of that song, which became their first Top 40 hit and an element in their early success. This lyric was also referenced by [[U2]] in their song "[[God Part II]]" from their album ''[[Rattle and Hum]]''. Also in 1991, three of Cockburn's songs were listed in a Toronto Star survey among Toronto's top songs of all time.<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/doc/436509795.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov+30%2C+1991&author=Bob+Mackowycz+Special+to+The+Star&pub=Toronto+Star&edition=&startpage=K.3&desc=T.O.%27s+top+songs+of+all+time "T.O.'s top songs of all time"]. ''Toronto Star'', Bob Mackowycz, November 30, 1991,  page K.3</ref>

In the early 1990s, Cockburn teamed with [[T Bone Burnett]] for two albums, ''Nothing but a Burning Light'' and ''Dart to the Heart''. The latter included a song, "Closer to the Light", inspired by the death of songwriter [[Mark Heard]], a close friend of Cockburn and Burnett. Cockburn frequently refers to Heard as his favourite songwriter and he was one of many artists who paid tribute to Heard on an album and video titled ''[[Strong Hand of Love]]''.

=== 2000s===
In 2001 Cockburn performed as part of the Music Without Borders concert, a benefit for the United Nations Donor Alert Appeal, which raised funds for refugees from Afghanistan, at the [[Air Canada Centre]] in Toronto.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20011121105024/http://chartattack.com/damn/2001/10/2203.cfm "LIVE: Music Without Borders"]. ''Chart Attack'', October 22, 2001. Review by Paul Gangadeen</ref>

In January 2003 Cockburn finished recording his 21st album, ''You've Never Seen Everything'', which features contributions from [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Jackson Browne]], [[Sam Phillips (singer)|Sam Phillips]], [[Sarah Harmer]], [[Hugh Marsh]], [[Jonell Mosser]], [[Larry Taylor]] and Steven Hodges.

Some of Cockburn's previously published material had been collected in several albums: ''Resume'', ''Mummy Dust'', and ''Waiting for a Miracle''. His first [[greatest hits]] collection was ''Anything Anytime Anywhere: Singles 1979–2002'', released in 2002.

Cockburn performed a set at the [[Live 8]] concert in [[Barrie, Ontario]], on July 2, 2005. ''Speechless'', an instrumental compilation of new and previously released material, was released on October 24, 2005.  His 22nd album, ''Life Short Call Now'', was released on July 18, 2006.

Canadian senator and retired general [[Roméo Dallaire]], who is active in humanitarian fundraising and promoting awareness, appeared on stage at the [[University of Victoria]] with Cockburn. The October 4, 2008, concert was held to aid the plight of child soldiers.<ref>''[[Victoria Times Colonist]]'', April 17, 2008</ref>

In 2009 Cockburn travelled to Afghanistan to visit his brother, Medical Officer Capt. John Cockburn, and to play a concert for Canadian troops. He performed his 1984 song "If I Had a Rocket Launcher" and was temporarily awarded an actual [[rocket launcher]] by the military. Cockburn has stated that, while unsure of the original [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Invasion of Afghanistan]], he supported [[Canada's role in the Afghanistan War|Canada's role there]].<ref>{{cite web|author=CBC |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/cockburn-visits-brother-in-afghanistan-1.852110 |title=Cockburn visits brother in Afghanistan |publisher=CBC.ca |access-date=March 13, 2014}}</ref>

Cockburn released the studio album ''[[Small Source of Comfort]]'' in 2011. "Lois on the Autobahn", a cheerful and experiential instrumental recalling "Rouler sa bosse" from ''Salt, Sun and Time'' is a tribute to Cockburn's mother, Lois, who succumbed to cancer in 2010.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In 2018, Cockburn's album ''Bone on Bone'', was named Contemporary Roots Album of the Year at the Juno Awards.<ref>[https://www.cbc.ca/music/junos/news/junos-2018-the-complete-list-of-winners-1.4579405 "Junos 2018: the complete list of winners"]. ''CBC News'',  · March 25, 2018</ref>

==Activism==
Cockburn's songwriting is often political, expressing concern for the environment and the welfare of indigenous peoples. ''[[Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians]]'' writes, "Cockburn always risked an outspoken stand in his work, taking on issues and morality to the detriment of his popular appeal. No artist since [[Phil Ochs]] has taken such strong political stands."<ref>Bordowitz, Hank (2001). "Cockburn, Bruce." In N. Slonimsky & L. Kuhn (eds.), ''Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians'' (Vol. 1, p. 673). New York: Schirmer.  ''Gale Virtual Reference Library'' (accessed June 5, 2018).</ref> He has worked with relief agency [[Oxfam]], travelling to Central America in 1983, and with the [[International Campaign to Ban Landmines]]. The song "Mines of Mozambique" (''The Charity of Night'') reflects his observations of that country during a visit in 1995. Cockburn is affiliated with the [[Unitarian Service Committee]] of Canada, twice visiting Nepal with the charity, in 1987 and 2007.<ref>Allen, p. 80</ref>

Songs on these themes include "[[If I Had a Rocket Launcher]]" (''Stealing Fire''), an angry response to the plight of refugees in Central America; "Stolen Land" (''Waiting for a Miracle''), about the [[aboriginal land claims|land claims]] of British Columbia's [[Haida people]]; and "If a Tree Falls" (''Big Circumstance'')—one of Cockburn's best-known songs—decrying the [[Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|deforestation of the Amazon]].<ref>Allen, pp. 81–83</ref>

==Documentaries and soundtracks==
Cockburn wrote and performed the theme song for the children's television series ''[[Franklin (TV series)|Franklin]]''. He composed and performed, with [[Hugh Marsh]], the music for the [[National Film Board of Canada]] documentary feature ''[[Waterwalker]]'' (1984), directed by [[Bill Mason]].  He also composed two songs for the classic English-Canadian film ''[[Goin' Down the Road]]'' (1970), directed by [[Donald Shebib]].

In 1998 Cockburn travelled with filmmaker Robert Lang to [[Mali]], [[West Africa]], where he jammed with [[Grammy Award]]-winning blues musician [[Ali Farka Toure]] and [[Kora (instrument)|kora]] master [[Toumani Diabate]]. The month-long journey was documented in the film ''River of Sand'', which won the ''Regard Canadien'' award for best documentary at the Vues d'Afrique Film Festival in [[Montreal]]. It was also invited for competition at the International Festival of Environmental Films in Paris.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://kensingtontv.com/go/riverofsand/indextop.html| website= kensingtontv.com| title= River of Sand| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130830185500/http://kensingtontv.com/go/riverofsand/indextop.html |archive-date= August 30, 2013}}</ref>

In 2007 Cockburn's music was featured in the [[Ecstasy (2007 film)|movie adaptation]] of [[Irvine Welsh]]'s best-selling novel ''[[Ecstasy: Three Tales of Chemical Romance]]''.

A documentary film, ''Bruce Cockburn Pacing the Cage'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visiontv.ca/bruce-cockburn-pacing-the-cage/ |title=Bruce Cockburn Pacing the Cage |publisher= Vision TV Channel Canada |website= visiontv.ca |date=June 23, 2011 |access-date=January 13, 2014}}</ref> was released in 2013 on television and a brief theatrical showing; directed by Joel Goldberg, gave a rare look into Cockburn's music, life and politics.

In 2018, Cockburn contributed the song "3 Al Purdys" to the compilation album ''[[The Al Purdy Songbook]]''.<ref>[https://nowtoronto.com/music/features/al-purdy-songbook/ "Canadian poet Al Purdy inspires songs by Jason Collett, Sarah Harmer and more"].

==Equipment==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2013}}
Cockburn has played guitars manufactured by a number of companies and [[luthier]]s over the years. Many early photos show him playing guitars made by the Canadian instrument-maker [[Larrivée (guitar company)|Larrivée]]. His request for an acoustic with greater access to higher frets directly led to [[Jean Larrivée]]'s "C" series of guitars. These innovative acoustics incorporated a cutaway, a previously rare feature on flat-top acoustics. Cockburn has owned at least two guitars made by Toronto luthier David Wren, a student of Larrivée, but these guitars were lost in a fire.

In recent years, Cockburn has been performing on guitars custom-made by [[Linda Manzer]], a Canadian luthier and another of Larrivée's protégés. Cockburn also plays a Resolectric guitar model from the [[National String Instrument Corporation|National Guitar Company]], and a steel-bodied [[Dobro]] resonator guitar. Cockburn has frequently used two early 1990s black Charvel Surfcasters, one tuned standard and the other in drop-D tuning. Cockburn has also begun playing a baritone guitar made by Ontario-based luthier Tony Karol.

==Personal life==
Cockburn was married from 1969 to 1980 to Kitty Macaulay and has a daughter, Jenny (b. July 14, 1976), from that marriage.<ref>Cockburn, p. 154</ref> {{Request quotation|date=October 2015|reason=We should have the names of both his first wife, daughter and the year of her birth to satisfy [[WP:BLP]]}}

While on vacation in Sweden with Kitty he experienced a personal crisis, arising from conflict in their marriage. He prayed and asked Jesus for help. In that moment he felt Jesus in the room, just as he had at their wedding. He became a follower of Christ on that day.<ref>Cockburn, pp. 132 & 133</ref>

Cockburn married his longtime girlfriend M. J. Hannett in 2011, shortly after the birth of his second daughter, Iona (b. November 21, 2011).<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2011/11/22/bruce_cockburn_66_and_girlfriend_welcome_new_baby.html |title=Bruce Cockburn, 66, and girlfriend welcome new baby |work= [[Toronto Star]] | via= thestar.com |date=November 22, 2011 |access-date=January 13, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| first= Nigel |last= Parry |url=http://cockburnproject.net/front.html |title=Bruce Cockburn online – Home |publisher=The Cockburn Project | website= cockburnproject.net|access-date=January 13, 2014}}</ref>
