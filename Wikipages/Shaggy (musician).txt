==Music career==
===1990s===
Shaggy decided to pursue his music career and his first hit in 1993, "[[Oh Carolina]]", was a [[dancehall]] re-make of a [[ska]] hit by the [[Folkes Brothers]], which appeared in the film ''[[Sliver (film)|Sliver]]''.<ref name="Huey">Huey, Steve [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p143424/biography|pure_url=yes}} "Shaggy Biography"], Allmusic, Macrovision Corporation</ref> The same year, Shaggy appeared on [[Kenny Dope]]'s hip hop album ''The Unreleased Project''. He worked together with producers such as [[Shaun Pizzonia|Sting International]], Don One, Lloyd 'Spiderman' Campbell, Robert Livingston and [[Frankie Cutlass]] on a remix from his Maxi-Single title "Nice and Lovely". He had further big hits, including "[[Boombastic (song)|Boombastic]]" in 1995,<ref name="Huey"/> the theme tune of a popular [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's]] commercial, and sang with [[Maxi Priest]] on his Top 20 hit from 1996, "[[That Girl (Maxi Priest song)|That Girl]]".<ref name=PoemHunter>{{cite web|title=Shaggy – Biography of Shaggy|url=http://www.poemhunter.com/lyrics/shaggy/biography/|website=PoemHunter.com|access-date=November 3, 2012|date=November 3, 2012}}</ref>

===Hot Shot (2000)===
In 1999, Shaggy was dropped by [[Virgin Records|Virgin]], who felt he was unlikely to release another song as successful as 1995's "Boombastic".<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNqgWvHa3LQ "The Story of 'It Wasn’t Me' by Shaggy"]. ''Vice'', July 10, 2020, via YouTube.</ref> He would sign with [[DreamWorks Records|Dreamworks]] to release the album  ''[[Hot Shot (Shaggy album)|Hot Shot]]'', the following year. The album featured the smash hit singles "[[It Wasn't Me]]" and "[[Angel (Shaggy song)|Angel]]", the latter of which was built around two song samples – [[Merrilee Rush]]'s 1968 hit "[[Angel of the Morning]]" (which was remade in 1981 by [[Juice Newton]]), and The [[Steve Miller Band]]'s 1973 hit "[[The Joker (Steve Miller Band song)|The Joker]]". Both songs topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and saw similar success worldwide, reaching number one in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK]], [[Irish Singles Chart|Ireland]], [[Scottish Singles and Albums Charts|Scotland]] and [[Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique|France]], among others.<ref name="Huey"/> ''Hot Shot'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and would go on to be certified 8x [[Platinum certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), as well as achieving platinum or multi platinum status in a number of other countries, and ranking as the second most successful album of 2001 on the [[Billboard Year-End|''Billboard'' Year-End]] charts.

In 2001 Shaggy was selected to perform with [[Rayvon]] and [[Rikrok]] at [[Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special|Michael Jackson's 30th anniversary]], performing the songs "Angel" and "It Wasn't Me" from ''Hot Shot''.

=== Further releases (2002–2009) ===
However, his 2002 release ''[[Lucky Day (Shaggy album)|Lucky Day]]'', and the 2005 album ''[[Clothes Drop]]'', failed to match ''Hot Shot'''s success, although ''Lucky Day'' still went [[Gold disc|gold]].<ref name="Huey"/> The albums, however, found success in Europe, especially with heavy airplay for the single "[[Hey Sexy Lady]]". Shaggy re-made the [[Scooby-Doo]] theme song on the soundtrack titled "Shaggy, Where Are You?". Shaggy also recorded the theme for the 2002 movie ''[[Showtime (film)|Showtime]]''. Shaggy's last top 40 single in the United States was "Angel" from the album ''Hot Shot''. On March 11, 2002, Shaggy and [[Ali G]] released "[[Me Julie]]" from the soundtrack to the film ''[[Ali G Indahouse]]''. The song sold 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom, as stated by the [[Official Charts Company]]. It spent 14 weeks on the [[UK Singles Chart]], peaking at number two.

Shaggy was featured on the album ''[[True Love (Toots & the Maytals album)|True Love]]'' by [[Toots and the Maytals]], which won the [[Grammy Award]] in 2004 for Best Reggae Album, and showcased many notable musicians including [[Willie Nelson]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Jeff Beck]], [[Trey Anastasio]], [[Gwen Stefani]] / [[No Doubt]], [[Ben Harper]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Manu Chao]], [[The Roots]], [[Ryan Adams]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Toots Hibbert]], [[Paul Douglas (musician)|Paul Douglas]], Jackie Jackson, [[Ken Boothe]], and [[The Skatalites]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tootsandthemaytals.net/linear-cd-notes/|title=Linear CD Notes|date=October 4, 2014|website=Tootsandthemaytals.net|access-date=April 23, 2018|archive-url=https://archive.today/20161110054527/http://www.tootsandthemaytals.net/linear-cd-notes/|archive-date=November 10, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Following the release of ''Clothes Drop'', Shaggy began to increase his number of live performances. In March 2007, he performed the official song of the [[ICC Cricket World Cup 2007]], titled "The Game of Love and Unity", alongside Bajan entertainer [[Rupee (musician)|Rupee]] and Trinidadian soca artist [[Fay-Ann Lyons]], at the opening ceremony of the tournament, held at The Greenfield Stadium, [[Trelawny Parish, Jamaica|Trelawny]], Jamaica.
