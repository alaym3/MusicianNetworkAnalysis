'''''The Whitest Kids U' Know (WKUK)''''' is an American [[sketch comedy]] show starring a comedy troupe of the same name. The group consisted of [[Trevor Moore (comedian)|Trevor Moore]], [[Zach Cregger]], [[Sam Brown (comedian)|Sam Brown]], [[Timmy Williams]] and Darren Trumeter, though other actors occasionally appeared in their sketches. They were accepted into the HBO [[U.S. Comedy Arts Festival]] in 2006 and won the award for Best Sketch Group.

==History==
[[File:Trevor Moore, Timmy Williams, Darren Trumeter, Sam Brown and Zach Cregger with the LG Electronics Kompressor Vacuum on 25th Spirit Awards Blue Carpet held at Nokia Theatre L.A. Live on March 5, 2010 in LA.jpg|thumb|left|The troupe at an event in 2010. From left to right: [[Trevor Moore (comedian)|Trevor Moore]], [[Timmy Williams]], Darren Trumeter, [[Sam Brown (comedian)|Sam Brown]], and [[Zach Cregger]]]]
The Whitest Kids began in 1999 when [[Trevor Moore (comedian)|Trevor Moore]], a young comedian from [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], transferred to New York's [[School of Visual Arts]] film program. Moore previously produced a local TV sketch-comedy show in [[Virginia]] titled ''The Trevor Moore Show'', which was picked up by [[PAX Network]].

After making the rounds at local [[New York City]] [[comedy clubs]], he eventually met fellow SVA film student [[Sam Brown (comedian)|Sam Brown]]<ref>DeBartolo, Dick; ''[[MAD (magazine)|MAD]]'' magazine #468; February 2008; Page 26.</ref> from [[Massachusetts]] and SVA Graphic Design student/actor [[Zach Cregger]], from Arlington, Virginia. By chance, all three lived in the same dormitory. According to an IFC interview, Trevor Moore said the group's name originated during a [[freestyle rapping]] session on a subway when one of their friends said, "You guys are the whitest kids I know".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifc.com/news/2008/02/the-whitest-kids-uknow-on-the.php|title=The Whitest Kids U'Know on "The Whitest Kids U'Know"|access-date=2009-03-12|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111061306/http://www.ifc.com/news/2008/02/the-whitest-kids-uknow-on-the.php|archive-date=2010-01-11}}</ref>

The troupe started off as an officially sanctioned club at School of Visual Arts. During the early years, WKUK included horror writer and director Jon Kovel, Oliver Lyons, Jordan Cooper, Anthony Mair, and singer Tina Tiongson. [[Timmy Williams]] also joined in late 2001 and was the only member at the time who did not attend SVA.<ref name=hullabaloo>Yanowitz, Zach [http://thehullabaloo.com/2009/03/18/talking-it-up-with-the-25ths-of-the-whitest-kids-u-know/ "Talking it up with 2/5ths of the Whitest Kids U Know"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20110617013748/http://thehullabaloo.com/2009/03/18/talking-it-up-with-the-25ths-of-the-whitest-kids-u-know/ |date=2011-06-17 }} March 18, 2009</ref>

''The Whitest Kids U' Know'' held near-monthly free shows at SVA's amphitheater, which would frequently fill to capacity.<ref>[http://blip.tv/file/4991914?filename=ThisMyShow-Episode14ZachCregger299.m4a This My Show interview with Zach Cregger]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref> Finally, in 2003, as Moore approached graduation, the group separated officially from the school, and all but Moore, Brown, Cregger and Williams left the troupe. Darren Trumeter, an actor and filmmaker who had worked previously with Cregger, was then added that same year.<ref>[http://www.ifc.com/wkuk/cast/darren-trumeter.php Darren Trumeter's biography on IFC]</ref>

Starting in 2003, the reinvented troupe started touring the various comedy venues in New York City, concluding in early 2005 with a well-attended show at [[Caroline's]], a famous stand-up comedy club in Times Square.

==Television==
In 2005, the group began working with noted comedy producer Jim Biederman. In early 2006, Biederman and the Whitest Kids sold the show to the [[Fuse TV|Fuse]] network after the Whitest Kids won the Best Sketch Group award at the Aspen Comedy Festival. Production of the first season took place in New York City, during the summer of 2006. The first season of ''The Whitest Kids U' Know'' premiered in March 2007. It was an instant hit for Fuse, and the show was immediately picked up for a second season.

However, due to what Fuse perceived as extreme comedy, the second season order came with limitations on content. The group considered walking away from the pick up order over the new content restrictions. Then former head of Fuse programming, Jennifer Caserta, left to become the General Manager of the IFC network and brought the Whitest Kids along with her to IFC. At the time, Fuse and IFC were both part of Rainbow Media. The Rainbow Media executives felt that the Whitest Kids program was more appropriate for IFC than Fuse, so they approved the switch.

On July 12, 2007, Trevor Moore posted a message on the Whitest Kids U' Know's official website stating that the second season of the Whitest Kids' TV show would move to the [[Independent Film Channel]] (IFC). According to Moore, they were excited about the channel switch because it allowed for no commercial breaks, with vulgarities and obscene content uncensored.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://whitestkids.com/2007/07/12/big-news-whitest-kids-move-to-ifc/ |title=Whitest Kids U Know » Blog Archive » BIG NEWS: WHITEST KIDS MOVE TO IFC!!!<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2011-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809050521/http://whitestkids.com/2007/07/12/big-news-whitest-kids-move-to-ifc/ |archive-date=2011-08-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, IFC began airing commercials during their programming on December 8, 2010, and the show was censored at certain times of day (including removing stronger sexual language such as "fuck" and censoring any nudity), despite promises that it would remain unedited.<ref name=adage>[http://adage.com/mediaworks/article?article_id=147520 IFC Adds Commercials and Cult Comedies, Exits the Art House] ''Advertising Age'' December 7, 2010</ref>

Shooting for season two of the show started on August 13, 2007, and debuted on IFC on February 10, 2008.

The season one DVD was released on February 5, 2008. It was stated several times on the show that the season was going to be first released uncensored on DVD. However, IFC started to air uncensored episodes of season one just two months before the DVD release.

The tenth episode of season two was broadcast live on IFC. The sketches performed on stage were based on their stage shows. Trevor Moore stated the live episode was a response to the season being one episode short.

The third season, which premiered on IFC on January 27, 2009, in the 10 pm time slot, was composed of ten 30-minute episodes as well as twenty 15-minute episodes. Both formats played on IFC.

The fourth season premiered on June 11, 2010, on IFC, continuing with the 10/30-minute and 20/15-minute episode formats.

The fifth season premiered on April 15, 2011, and was the final season of the show. The format of 10 half-hour episodes remains, with each episode ending with a segment of The Civil War on Drugs, a full-length film starring Whitest Kids troupe members reimagining the [[American Civil War]] as a war on drugs.<ref name=IFC>[http://www.ifc.com/blogs/ifc-now/2011/03/whitest-kids-uknow-are-back-on.php Whitest Kids U' Know are back on IFC April 15] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314090224/http://www.ifc.com/blogs/ifc-now/2011/03/whitest-kids-uknow-are-back-on.php |date=2011-03-14 }}</ref> Moore revealed that the film will be released on Amazon in feature-length with a commentary by him and the rest of the troupe.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBnMJF9I45Q&t=4791s&ab_channel=wkukVODS]</ref>

==Return==
On May 6, 2020, Trevor Moore started a short-lived internet series during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] titled "Trevor Moore's Quarantine Show" uploaded to a newly created [[YouTube]] channel called OfficialWKUK.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNwbDMbDV7gu6-rO70lCQJg</ref> Moore, Brown, Cregger, Trumeter, and Williams later started uploading more frequently to the channel featuring HD quality video of their sketches from their show. They also would occasionally upload a [[Dungeons and Dragons]] campaign entitled "Buckerson and Meyers" where they humorously attempt to complete the campaign laid out by Williams.

On September 5, 2020, the group started video streaming on [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] with weekly scheduled shows with no permanent timeslots:

* '''Collective Souls''' - Cregger plays 2016 [[video game]] ''[[Dark Souls III]]'', where he attempts to achieve a "No Death Run" and occasionally takes a fan or other members of the comedy troupe calls, during play. Typically he streams Monday, Wednesday, or Friday. On December 29, 2020, Cregger successfully achieved a no death run of Demon's Souls.
* '''Timmy Plays Animal Crossing''' - Williams plays the 2020 video game ''[[Animal Crossing: New Horizons]]'', usually streaming on Monday.
* '''Sam's Show For Depressed Losers''' - Brown hosts the show with no particular topic or plan in mind, occasionally streaming with Trumeter or viewers that call-in through [[Discord (software)|Discord]]. Brown streams on Wednesdays.
* '''Sexy Socks''' - Originally "Sexy Stocks", Trumeter and Brown discuss the [[stock market]] and converse with the Twitch chat room. They have the most inconsistent timeslot, streaming off and on Wednesday.
* '''Zucchini Boyz''' - Williams cooks from recipes, live, usually taking requests from the Twitch chat room. He typically streams on Thursdays.
* '''Newsboyz''' - "The flagship show" according to co-host Trevor Moore. The show consists of Moore and co-host Zach Cregger reading news articles and discussing their week. Moore and Cregger spend the whole week without reading the news in an attempt to give more realistic takes while on the show. They refer to the show as "the best show on the network" much to the chagrin of the rest of the troupe. They have one of the most consistent time-slots streaming on Friday, 7 pm-9 pm PST.
* '''Self Suck Saturday''' - The most popular show on the Twitch channel, the stream consists of the entire troupe watching sketches from their IFC television show, conversation with chat, and viewing fan art. Along with Newsboyz, it has one of the most consistent time-slots, streaming on Saturday at 7 pm PST.

They have stated all the money they make from the [[YouTube]] and Twitch will go to the production of their new animated film ''Mars''.

Following Moore's death on August 7, 2021, the future of the troupe is unclear.

==Recurring characters==

'''[[Abraham Lincoln]]'''&nbsp;– The 16th President of the United States. He is seen in the sketches "Abe Lincoln," "John Wilkes Booth," and "The Civil War on Drugs." Abraham Lincoln is played by Zach Cregger and John Wilkes Booth is played by Trevor Moore. In "Abe Lincoln" and "John Wilkes Booth", he is the victim of [[John Wilkes Booth]]'s assassination attempts, though in each sketch the circumstances are quite different. In "Abe Lincoln", Lincoln disrupts a performance of ''[[Hamlet]]'', frustrating Booth sitting in the audience, and is consequentially bashed to death with a hammer. In "John Wilkes Booth" the president is victim of constant harassment by Booth, who sneaks into the theater and hits him with a variety of objects while saying ''[[Sic semper tyrannis]]''. In "The Civil War on Drugs," Trevor Moore and Sam Brown portray activists who travel to [[Washington D.C.]] to see Abraham Lincoln and make [[marijuana]] legal, thinking the entire [[American Civil War]] was about it.

'''[[Adolf Hitler]]'''&nbsp;– Hitler is played by Trevor Moore and appears in the sketches "Charlie Chaplin", "Little Hitler" and "Triumph of the Ill", a rap song about his desire to stop being the [[Führer]] and instead become a rapper. Hitler also makes appearances in some sketches filmed when the troupe was still part of the SVA.

'''Billy Matherson/Masterson'''&nbsp;– Billy Matherson/Masterson has appeared in multiple sketches and is depicted as a young male child. He has appeared in the sketches "Irresponsible Television," "Genie," and a few others. Not much can be said about Billy Matherson himself as his character and situation seems to vary from sketch to sketch. Usually, he is played by Timmy Williams. In "Dear Black People," his name is changed to Danny Matherson.

'''Mr. Welburn'''&nbsp;– A powerful and rich executive of a company whose purpose or product is unknown. The Boss is well known for considering unusual and violent situations as normal and not worth making a big deal out of. He appears in "Sniper Business"/"Business Battle," where he calmly explains to his employee Jenkins at his office that business is about hard work and integrity&nbsp;– while trying to avoid and kill a sniper hired by rival business Bergman-Sachs. He is also seen in "Asian Hooker," where he tries to coordinate and run an office meeting while chained to a bed and a screaming Vietnamese prostitute. As the meeting progresses, the woman's pimp enters and stabs her repeatedly, while Mr. Welburn continues to run the meeting to the best of his abilities, despite objections from his colleagues. Mr. Welburn reappeared in "Not Particularly Sure," claiming that he does not know what his company actually does, after having subcontracted out all of their work. The character is usually played by Trevor Moore, and is characterized by his deep, official, and serious voice.

'''Caleb'''&nbsp;– Not strictly a recurring character, but Caleb is typically a name that has been used several times, along with the names "Brian", "Rick" and "Candice". Unlike most other characters that share a name, Caleb's character is relatively consistent. He is usually depicted as an average teenager who is always getting in some sort of trouble. He appears in "Blue Whale Dick," "Homeschool," "Walk of Shame," and "We Buy Drugs", and is mentioned in "Call of Duty," played by different Whitest Kids members each time, but most commonly Darren. His last name varies, with "Matthews", "McLaughlin", and "Carlyle" having all been used.

'''Candice''' – The most common woman's name in the sketches of this comedy troupe. Almost every time a female name is mentioned it is Candice.

'''Jerry Bronham'''&nbsp;– The chairman of the National Hunting Board, seen in the sketches "Sexy Fawn," "I Don't Know Bob," and "Point/Counterpoint", played by [[Trevor Moore (comedian)|Trevor Moore]]. He is incredibly tasteless, promoting things such as baby skull-seeking bullets and making jokes about his best friend's death. He is not above killing innocent people and has even killed a baby before (though by accident). Moore confirmed him as a recurring character in the commentary of the season one [[DVD]].

'''Meredith''' – Much like Candice, Meredith is usually the name of a character's spouse. Whenever a character's wife is mentioned, her name is usually Meredith. Her marriage is usually troubled, or she has already been divorced, as seen in the "Office Sniper" and "Helicopter Wife" sketches.

'''Sasha The Fabulous'''&nbsp;– Pops in the end of several sketches in the fourth season to say her catchphrase: "Oh, Hell no!"

'''[[Satan]]'''&nbsp;– The Lord of Hell. His appearance varies throughout sketches. In "Demon [[Ouija]] Board," he is a disembodied booming voice who reminds Balthalthazar (possibly a deliberate misspelling of Balthazar) that the sole job of demons is to entertain. In contrast, he appears in Act 3 of "Opus Acts 1–4" as a horned humanoid who rants about people making assumptions on who he is. Satan is also mentioned several times by various Whitest characters throughout the sketches.

'''SuperDog'''&nbsp;– Perhaps more of a prop than a character. SuperDog has made appearances in several episodes of season three, with Sam carrying him around. SuperDog also has a cult following of humans who think of him as a god.

==Films==
Moore and Cregger wrote, directed, and starred in the 2009 comedy film ''[[Miss March]]''.

In 2012, Moore wrote on his website that a true Whitest Kids U' Know movie was planned, and that the script was being written.<ref>[http://trevormoore.org/?p=112 NEW QUESTIONS ROUND 4!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130711034745/http://trevormoore.org/?p=112 |date=2013-07-11 }}, TrevorMoore.org, July 11, 2012 ("Yeah, we’re working on a new WKUK movie right now. We’re hoping to have the script done by the end of the summer and then we’d like to shoot it as soon as possible.")</ref>

On February 11, 2017, Moore announced via [[Instagram]] that the film's script had been completed.<ref name="Instagram">{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BQZRyUYBwvn/|title=''Finished the WKUK movie script. It's ok.'' on Instagram}}</ref>

On November 17, 2020, Cregger revealed the name of the film to be "[[Mars]]" and will be animated instead of live-action. Cregger also mentioned instead of being funded by a studio they preferred to raise the money themselves.

On February 16, 2021, The Civil War on Drugs was released in its entirety on Amazon, with the troupe's audio commentary as a feature.
