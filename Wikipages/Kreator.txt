'''Kreator''' is a German [[thrash metal]] band from [[Essen]], formed in 1982. Their current lineup consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist [[Mille Petrozza|Miland "Mille" Petrozza]], drummer [[Jürgen Reil|Jürgen "Ventor" Reil]], lead guitarist [[Sami Yli-Sirniö]], and bassist [[Frédéric Leclercq]]. The band's lineup has changed multiple times over its {{Age|1982|1|1}}-year career, most noticeably with their bassists and lead guitarists. Petrozza and Reil are the only two original members left in Kreator, although Reil took a brief hiatus from the band from 1994 to 1996. Yli-Sirniö has been the lead guitarist of Kreator since 2001, while Leclercq joined in 2019 as the replacement of [[Christian Giesler|Christian "Speesy" Giesler]], who had been a member of the band since 1994.

To date, Kreator has released fourteen studio albums, two EPs, two live albums and three compilation albums.

==History==
===Formation and early releases (1982–1987)===
The band was formed as Metal Militia in 1982 in [[Essen, Germany]] and then Tyrant. Later they used the title Tormentor until 1984, when they changed to the present name Kreator. The original lineup featured lead vocalist/guitarist [[Mille Petrozza]], drummer [[Jürgen Reil|Jürgen "Ventor" Reil]], and bassist Rob Fioretti. Kreator recorded their debut album, ''[[Endless Pain]]'' (1985), in just ten days. The band hired the late [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]] guitarist Michael Wulf for the album's tour to play lead, while Petrozza switched to rhythm guitar.

Wulf was in the band for a few days but never on the band's second album, ''[[Pleasure to Kill]]'' (1986), which is widely considered a thrash classic<ref name="Sorted MagAZine">{{cite web|title=Sorted MagAZine - Review of ''Pleasure to Kill''|author=Ken Blackmore|publisher=Sorted MagAZine|url=http://sortedmagazine.com/Distorted.php3?nID=354|access-date=26 March 2007}}</ref><ref name=HailMetal.com>{{cite web|title=HailMetal.com - HailMetal.com's Top 50 Thrash Albums of All Time|website=HailMetal.com|url=http://www.hailmetal.com/gate.html?name=BestOfThrash|access-date=26 March 2007|year=2006}}</ref><ref name="All Music Guide"/> and a big influence on the [[death metal]] genre.<ref>{{cite web |title=CD Gallery - Kreator |url=http://www.nolifetilmetal.com/kreator.htm |publisher=No Life 'til Metal |access-date=7 December 2011}}</ref><ref name="history"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://invisibleoranges.com/interviews/cannibalcorpse.html |title=Interview with Cannibal Corpse |publisher=[[Invisible Oranges]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703180313/http://invisibleoranges.com/interviews/cannibalcorpse.html |archive-date=3 July 2007 |access-date=7 December 2011}}</ref> It would not be until 31 years after its release that ''Pleasure to Kill'' entered the German album charts.<ref name="GER"/> Produced by [[Harris Johns]] ([[Sodom (band)|Sodom]], [[Helloween]], [[Voivod (band)|Voivod]]), the album showed the band growing in talent and technical ability. The song "Flag of Hate" became a concert standard, and the band became one of the most promising up-and-coming European metal acts. The band started their first tour ever (before the release of ''Pleasure to Kill'', they had only played five gigs total); they played their first shows outside of Germany in the fall of 1986, supporting bands like [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]] and [[Celtic Frost]], and in the spring of 1987, they toured the US for the first time, opening for [[Voivod (band)|Voivod]] on their ''[[Killing Technology]]'' tour.<ref name="metallipromo">{{cite web|url=http://metallipromo.com/kr.html|title=Kreator Tour Dates|work=metallipromo.com|access-date=11 December 2020}}</ref> Kreator's first [[extended play|EP]], ''[[Flag of Hate]]'', was also released in 1986, and around this time, Jörg "Tritze" Trzebiatowski had joined the band.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

===Rising popularity (1987–1991)===
In 1987, Kreator released their third studio album, ''[[Terrible Certainty]]'', which is often considered a high-quality Kreator album as the arrangements on the album were more complex and the tempos more varied.<ref name="AllMusic">{{cite web|title=AllMusic - Review of ''Terrible Certainty'' |author=Vincent Jeffries |publisher=[[AllMusic]]|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=terrible-certainty-mw0000199537|pure_url=yes}} |access-date=26 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.billboard.com%2F%23%2Fartist%2FRihanna%2Fchart-history%2F658897%3Ff%3D793%26g%3DSingles&date=2011-10-02 |archive-date= 2 October 2011 }}</ref> The album featured another hit "Behind the Mirror", and the band's popularity continued to grow and a video for "Toxic Trace" was created for MTV play. They managed to find enough time and money (coming from the concerts) to finance another EP, ''[[Out of the Dark... Into the Light]]''. By this point, Kreator had already graduated to headlining their own tours, as well as playing at theaters and arenas with bands such as [[Megadeth]], [[Voivod (band)|Voivod]], [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]], [[Dirty Rotten Imbeciles|D.R.I.]] and Holy Terror.<ref name="metallipromo" />

Berlin based [[independent record label]] [[Noise Records]] licensed Kreator for the territories outside of Europe and Japan to the major label [[Epic Records]] in 1988. Their fourth studio album and debut with Epic (for limited territories) ''[[Extreme Aggression]]'', recorded in Los Angeles, became a metal hit in Europe upon its release in 1989; however, the album would not enter the German album charts until 28 years after its release.<ref name="GER"/> Continuing the ''Terrible Certainty'' formula while showing the band still progressing musically, and with better production by the well-regarded Randy Burns (also [[Megadeth]], [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]], [[Nuclear Assault]], [[Death (metal band)|Death]], [[Dark Angel (band)|Dark Angel]], among others), the album featured the band's first major singles, the title track, "Betrayer" and the radio-only "Love Us or Hate Us", gaining support from the Southern California radio station [[KNAC]], and the video for "Betrayer" receiving airplay on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Headbangers Ball]]''.<ref name="knac">{{cite web|url=http://knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=23981|title=Four 80's Era KREATOR Classics To Be Reissued|work=[[KNAC|KNAC.COM]]|access-date=11 December 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Headbangers Ball- The Unofficial Tribute Site - Episode Database|url=https://www.headbangersballunofficialtributesite.com/episode-database|work=headbangersballunofficialtributesite.com|access-date=11 December 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockhard.gr/somewhere-back-time/day-remember-1906-kreator|title=A Day To Remember... 19/06 [KREATOR]|work=[[Rock Hard (magazine)|Rockhard Greece]]|language=el|access-date=11 December 2020}}</ref> This – as well as playing with bands like [[King Diamond (band)|King Diamond]], [[Raven (British band)|Raven]], [[Coroner (band)|Coroner]], [[Suicidal Tendencies]], [[Death (metal band)|Death]] and [[Sadus]] – greatly expanded their popularity outside of Germany.<ref name="metallipromo" /><ref name="knac"/>

Also in 1989, German director Thomas Schadt made a documentary about Kreator (focusing on the social aspect of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] in the [[Ruhr Area]]) titled ''Thrash Altenessen'' (named after the band's hometown, a suburb of Essen). Tritze left Kreator after ''Extreme Aggression''. In 1990, with new guitarist [[Frank Blackfire|Frank "Blackfire" Gosdzik]] (also formerly of [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]]), the band released their fifth studio album ''[[Coma of Souls]]'', again produced by Burns. The album was not quite as praised as the band's previous few albums (many felt the album was "rushed" and repetitive),<ref name="All Music Guide"/> but still managed sell and maintain popularity quite well, with the singles "When the Sun Burns Red" and "People of the Lie" becoming hits.

===Experimentation (1992–2000)===
The early 1990s brought a decline in the popularity of traditional thrash metal. With many other thrash bands such as [[Metallica]], [[Megadeth]] and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] changing their style by incorporating more melodic elements into their compositions, Kreator began experimenting with [[groove metal]] and [[industrial metal]] around this time.

The result was ''[[Renewal (album)|Renewal]]'', released in 1992, which featured heavy death metal and industrial influences. While reaching a newer audience, the band upset many longtime fans, accusing them of "[[selling out]]".<ref name="UTTER DARK webzine">{{cite web|title=UTTER DARK webzine – Kreator interview|author=Bertrand Garnier|publisher=UTTER DARK webzine|url=http://utterdark.free.fr/kreator1.htm|access-date=27 March 2007|date=29 February 2000}}</ref><ref name="Extreem Metaal"/> The band experienced a decline in popularity as the result of the backlash against the album.

The line-up of the band underwent significant changes too. Founding member Roberto Fioretti left the band after the recording of the album and was replaced by Andreas Herz. In 1994, Reil left as well, leaving Petrozza the sole original band member. Reil was replaced by Joe Cangelosi while Herz left the same year and was replaced by [[Christian Giesler]]. During this time "Epic Records" dropped the band from the contract making them enter into an agreement with [[GUN Records]]. The new lineup released the album ''[[Cause for Conflict]]'' the same year. The songs bore a heavy influence of such bands as [[Pantera]] and [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]] as well as the partial resemblance of "Renewal".{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Gosdzik and Cangelosi left in 1996 and were replaced by Tommy Vetterli (formerly of [[Coroner (band)|Coroner]]). This new line-up saw Reil return. Kreator continued to experiment producing ''[[Outcast (Kreator album)|Outcast]]'' and ''[[Endorama]]'', with [[ambient music|ambient]] and [[gothic rock|gothic]] influences, incorporated [[sampling (music)|samples]] and [[loop (music)|loops]]. Petrozza employed different approaches for singing, and the albums retained the [[groove metal]] influences. However, the record sales went down and by the end of the 1990s the band reached commercial and critical nadir. Despite that, Mille Petrozza was quoted stating: ''"For us, success doesn't define in record sales. So all our albums have been successful for us, because we've achieved what we were aiming for..."''.<ref name="Extreem Metaal">{{cite web|title=Extreem Metaal - Kreator|publisher=Extreem Metaal|url=http://www.extreemmetaal.nl/interviews/interviews/kreator_duitsland.html|access-date=27 March 2007|date=21 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301095851/http://www.extreemmetaal.nl/interviews/interviews/kreator_duitsland.html|archive-date=1 March 2007}}</ref>

===Return in style (2001–2009)===
[[File:Kreator by Christian Misje.jpg|220px|thumb|left|Kreator performing live at [[Hole in the Sky]] in 2007]]
In 2001, with new lead guitarist [[Sami Yli-Sirniö]], Kreator released their "comeback" album ''[[Violent Revolution]]'', which saw the band returning to their classic thrash metal style. Despite containing a lot of melodic and so called "[[Melodic death metal|Gothenburg metal]]" riffs, ''Violent Revolution'' was praised by fans and critics alike and benefited from the 2000s thrash metal revival movement, led by bands like [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]], [[Slayer]], [[Megadeth]], [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]] and [[Testament (band)|Testament]].<ref name="Ultimate Metal Reviews">{{cite web|title=Ultimate Metal Reviews – Review of ''Violent Revolution''|publisher=Ultimate Metal Reviews|url=http://www.metal-reviews.com/ijk/kre-vr.htm|access-date=27 March 2007}}</ref><ref name="Metal Storm Review">{{cite web|title=Metal Storm – Review of ''Violent Revolution''|publisher=Metal Storm|url=http://www.metalstorm.ee/bands/album.php?album_id=986&band_id=&bandname=Kreator|access-date=27 March 2007|date=19 September 2003}}</ref><ref name="Maelstrom Zine">{{cite web|title=Maelstrom Zine - Review of ''Violent Revolution''|publisher=Maelstrom Zine|url=http://www.maelstrom.nu/ezine/review_iss8_322.php|access-date=27 March 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012132918/http://maelstrom.nu/ezine/review_iss8_322.php|archive-date=12 October 2007}}</ref><ref name="AllMusic Violent Revolution review">{{cite web|title=Allmusic - Review of ''Violent Revolution'' |author=Gary Hill |publisher=[[AllMusic]]|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=violent-revolution-mw0000013894|pure_url=yes}} |access-date=27 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.billboard.com%2F%23%2Fartist%2FRihanna%2Fchart-history%2F658897%3Ff%3D793%26g%3DSingles&date=2011-10-02 |archive-date= 2 October 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-10-best-thrash-songs-from-2000-18|title=The 10 best thrash songs from 2000-2020|publisher=[[Metal Hammer|Louder]]|date=July 31, 2018|access-date=January 23, 2021}}</ref> The tour was extremely successful and introduced Kreator to a younger generation of metal fans.

This album also saw a special edition re-release in 2006 called ''Enemy of God: Revisited''. In early 2006, Kreator toured North America with [[Napalm Death]], [[A Perfect Murder (band)|A Perfect Murder]], and The Undying. There was a joint headline European tour with [[Celtic Frost]] in 2007 with support from [[Watain]], Kreator were to tour 2008 with [[King Diamond]], [[Leaves' Eyes]], and [[Cellador]], however, the tour was canceled due to back issues with King Diamond.

In March 2008, the ''[[At the Pulse of Kapitulation 1990/1991|At the Pulse of Kapitulation]]'' DVD was released, featuring ''Live in East Berlin'' and ''[[Hallucinative Comas]]'' on one disc. Both had previously been available on VHS only and were long out of print. The band had also begun working on their 12th full-length album in late 2007/early 2008 and began recording in July 2008.

===Upcoming fifteenth studio album and split with Christian Giesler (2018–present)===
About three months after the release of ''Gods of Violence'', Petrozza mentioned a follow-up album, saying, "Maybe we should work with a different producer. Maybe we should go to a different country to record the album. Maybe we should write a more metal or more full-on thrash metal. Whatever we feel, first and foremost, that is the most important thing.

That's the plan at least. We'll see what happens. I don't put myself under pressure. Let's see how I feel after this tour, and if I have ideas for new music, I will book a studio and start working on demos as soon as I have the time.

==Musical style==
Kreator's musical style is similar to that of their compatriots [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]], [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]] and [[Tankard (band)|Tankard]], which is usually more complex and, since ''[[Violent Revolution]]'' (2001), more melodic. Along with those three bands, Kreator has been referred to as one of the "Big Four" of [[Teutonic thrash metal]],<ref name="big four"/> and they are often credited with helping pioneer [[death metal]] and [[black metal]] by containing several elements of what was to become those genres.<ref name="Metal Storm"/> The band's style has changed several times over the years, from a [[Venom (band)|Venom]]-inspired [[speed metal]] sound,<ref>''Live Kreation: Revisioned Glory'' DVD: The first scene of the history of the band section.</ref> later moving into thrash metal, and including a period of transitioning from thrash to [[industrial metal]] and [[gothic metal]] throughout the 1990s. In the early 2000s, Kreator returned to their classic thrash sound, which has continued to the present.

Kreator has been influenced by a variety of music such as [[The Beatles]],<ref name="Mille interview">{{cite web|title=KREATOR Frontman: 'I Try Not To Sound Like Anyone Else'|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/kreator-frontman-i-try-not-to-sound-like-anyone-else/|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=May 31, 2021}}</ref> [[hardcore punk]] bands like [[Bad Religion]],<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|title=Kreator - Similar Artists|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/kreator-mn0000103324/related|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=May 31, 2021}}</ref> [[Dirty Rotten Imbeciles|D.R.I.]],<ref>{{cite web|title=D.R.I.
