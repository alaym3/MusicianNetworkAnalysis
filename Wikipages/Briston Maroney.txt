==Personal life==
Maroney has stated that, within the span of about a month in 2018, he dropped out of college, ended a relationship, and, thus, had to find a permanent place to stay and a stable job to work at. Despite being underage at that time, he went to rehab for about two months. He kept figuring out what to do with his life as he moved from Knoxville to California, from there to Florida, and from Florida back to Nashville, during which time he decided to keep pursuing a career in music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://holliesikes.weebly.com/capturing-a-moment-talking-with-briston-maroney-about-his-new-ep.html|title=Capturing a Moment: Talking with Briston Maroney about His New EP|website=Red Canyon Records|language=en-US|access-date=December 11, 2019}}</ref>
