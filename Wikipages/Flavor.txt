'''Flavor''', or '''flavour''',{{efn|See spelling differences: [[American and British English spelling differences]]}} is the [[perceptual]] impression of [[food]] or other [[chemical substance|substances]] as determined primarily by the [[Chemoreceptor|chemical]] [[sense]]s of the [[gustatory system|gustatory]] and [[olfactory system]].<ref>Small DM, Green BG. A Proposed Model of a Flavor Modality. In: Murray MM, Wallace MT, editors. The Neural Bases of Multisensory Processes. Boca Raton (FL): CRC Press/Taylor & Francis; 2012. Chapter 36.

The taste of food can be altered [[nature|naturally]] or artificially.

Of the three chemical senses, [[Sense of smell|smell]] is the main determinant of a food item's flavor. Five [[basic tastes]] – [[sweet]], [[sour]], [[bitter (taste)|bitter]], [[saltiness|salty]] and [[umami]] (savory) are universally recognized, although some cultures also include [[pungency]]<ref name="Bueker">[https://books.google.com/books?id=s2hsBJAp5fYC&lpg=PP1&dq=Ayurvedic%20balancing%3A%20an%20integration%20of%20Western%20fitness%20with%20Eastern%20wellness&pg=PA25#v=onepage&q=the%20six%20tastes&f=false Ayurvedic balancing: an integration of Western fitness with Eastern wellness (Pages 25-26/188)] Joyce Bueker.

This is exemplified in artificially flavored [[gelatin dessert|jellies]], [[soft drink]]s and candies, which, while made of bases with a similar taste, have dramatically different flavors due to the use of different scents or fragrances. The flavorings of commercially produced food products are typically created by [[flavorist]]s.

Products not intended to be consumed, which are added to food in order to impart or modify odour and/or taste, are called flavorings or flavourings. A "flavorant" or "flavour-ant" is defined as a substance that gives another substance taste, altering the characteristics of the solute, causing it to become sweet, sour, tangy, etc. Although both terms, in common language, denote the combined chemical sensations of taste and smell, the same terms are used in the fragrance and flavors industry to refer to edible chemicals and extracts that alter the flavor of food and food products through the sense of smell.

Owing to the high cost, or unavailability of natural flavor extracts, most commercial flavorants are "nature-identical", which means that they are the [[chemical compound|chemical]] equivalent of natural flavors, but chemically synthesized rather than being extracted from source materials. Identification of components of natural foods, for example a raspberry, may be done using technology such as [[headspace technology|headspace techniques]], so the flavorist can imitate the flavor by using a few of the same chemicals present. In the EU legislation, the term "natural-identical flavouring" does not exist. The legislation is specified on what is a "flavouring" and a "natural flavouring".<ref>Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on flavourings and certain food ingredients with flavouring properties for use in and on foods and amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 1601/91, Regulations (EC) No 2232/96 and (EC) No 110/2008 and Directive 2000/13/EC (Text with EEA relevance): https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32008R1334  [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]]  Text was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License].</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://glosbe.com/en/en/flavorant|title=flavorant – definition – English|website=Glosbe|language=en|access-date=2018-09-26}}</ref>  A flavor is a quality of something that affects the sense of taste.<ref>{{cite web|title=Definition of FLAVOR|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/flavor|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en}}</ref>

==Flavorants or flavorings==

EU legislation defines several types of flavorings:<ref>European Commission website, Directorate General for Health and Food Safety. Retrieved on 6 May 2020 https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/food_improvement_agents/flavourings_en</ref>
•	flavoring substances (including ‘natural flavoring substances’): 
•	flavoring preparations (by definition always natural): 
•	thermal process flavorings
•	smoke flavorings
•	flavor precursors
•	other flavorings

Three principal types of flavorings are used in foods, under definitions agreed in [[Australia]]:<ref>[http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/_srcfiles/flavourings_user_guide_0802.pdf From Australian Food Standards Guidelines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720091222/http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/_srcfiles/flavourings_user_guide_0802.pdf |date=2008-07-20 }}</ref>

;Natural flavoring substances
:These flavoring substances are obtained from plant or animal raw materials, by physical, microbiological, or enzymatic processes. They can be either used in their natural state or processed for human consumption, but cannot contain any nature-identical or artificial flavoring substances.
;Nature-identical flavoring substances
:These are obtained by synthesis or isolated through chemical processes, which are chemically and [[organoleptic]]ally identical to flavoring substances naturally present in products intended for human consumption. They cannot contain any artificial flavoring substances.
;Artificial flavoring substances
:These are not identified in a natural product intended for human consumption, whether or not the product is processed. These are typically produced by [[fractional distillation]] and additional chemical manipulation of naturally sourced chemicals, [[crude oil]], or [[coal tar]].  Although they are chemically different, in sensory characteristics they are the same as natural ones.

Most artificial flavors are specific and often complex mixtures of singular naturally occurring flavor compounds combined to either imitate or enhance a natural flavor. These mixtures are formulated by flavorists to give a food product a unique flavor and to maintain flavor consistency between different product batches or after recipe changes. The list of known flavoring agents includes thousands of molecular compounds, and the flavor chemist (flavorist) can often mix these together to produce many of the common flavors. Many flavorants consist of [[ester]]s, which are often described as being "sweet" or "fruity".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/question391.htm|title=How do artificial flavors work?|publisher=howstuffworks|access-date=3 June 2015|date=2000-05-31}}</ref>

The compounds used to produce artificial flavors are almost identical to those that occur naturally. It has been suggested that artificial flavors may be safer to consume than natural flavors due to the standards of purity and mixture consistency that are enforced either by the company or by law.<ref name="Smitha">{{cite journal | title = A procedure for the safety evaluation of natural flavor complexes used as ingredients in food: essential oils  | authors = R.L.

Flavors from food products are usually the result of a combination of natural flavors, which set up the basic smell profile of a food product, while artificial flavors modify the smell to accent it.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/dec/08/fake-flavours-artificial-aromas-real-food-smells-aromafork|title=Fake flavours: why artificial aromas can't compete with real food smells|author=Amy Fleming|publisher=Food & Drink|access-date=3 June 2015|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2014-12-08}}</ref>

Unlike smelling, which occurs upon [[inhalation]], the sensing of flavors in the mouth occurs in the [[exhalation]] phase of [[breathing]] and is perceived differently by an individual. In other words, the smell of food is different depending on whether one is smelling it before or after it has entered one's mouth.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.neulet.2010.02.024 | title = Expiration: The moment we experience retronasal olfaction in flavor | year = 2010 | last1 = Masaoka | first1 = Yuri | last2 = Satoh | first2 = Hironori | last3 = Akai | first3 = Lena | last4 = Homma | first4 = Ikuo | journal = Neuroscience Letters | volume = 473 | issue = 2 | pages = 92–6 | pmid = 20171264| s2cid = 2671577 }}</ref>

===Taste===
Under the EU legislation, substances which have exclusively a sweet, sour or salty taste are not considered flavorings (Article 2, Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008<ref>Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on flavourings and certain food ingredients with flavouring properties for use in and on foods: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32008R1334  [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]]  Text was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License].</ref>)

Umami or "savory" flavorants, more commonly called taste or flavor enhancers, are largely based on [[amino acid]]s and [[nucleotide]]s. These are typically used as [[sodium]] or [[calcium]] [[salt (chemistry)|salts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glutamate.org/history/100_years_of_taste.html|title=Monosodium Glutamate & Umami|publisher=International Glutamate Information Service|access-date=3 June 2015}}</ref> Umami flavorants recognized and approved by the European Union include:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodadditivesworld.com/flavorings.html|title=Flavorings|publisher=Food Additives|access-date=3 June 2015}}</ref>

(NB: these are not considered flavorings under the EU legislation but additives<ref>Point 14 of Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 on food additives</ref>)
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Acid salts
!Description
|-
|[[Glutamic acid]] salts
|This amino acid's sodium salt, [[monosodium glutamate]] (MSG), is one of the most commonly used flavor enhancers in food processing. Mono- and diglutamate salts are also commonly used.
|-
|[[Glycine]] salts
|Simple amino acid salts typically combined with glutamic acid as flavor enhancers
|-
|[[Guanylic acid]] salts
|Nucleotide salts typically combined with glutamic acid as flavor enhancers
|-
|[[Inosinic acid]] salts
|Nucleotide salts created from the breakdown of AMP, <!-- AMP deaminase? Not commonly known to non-specialists? --> due to high costs of production, typically combined with glutamic acid as flavor enhancers
|-
|5'-[[ribonucleotide]] salts
|Nucleotide salts typically combined with other amino acids and nucleotide salts as flavor enhancers
|}

Certain organic and inorganic acids can be used to enhance sour tastes, but like salt and sugar, these are usually not considered and regulated as flavorants under law. Each acid imparts a slightly different sour or tart taste that alters the flavor of a food.

==Restrictions and regulations==

In the EU, Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 on flavorings and certain food ingredients with flavoring properties for use in/on foods, i.e. the "EU Flavouring Regulation", was adopted on 16 December 2008 and entered into force on 20 January 2009.  It applies from 20 January 2011.
Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 lays down general requirements for safe use of flavorings and provides definitions for different types of flavorings. The Regulation sets out substances for which an evaluation and approval is required. The Union list of flavoring substances, approved for use in and on foods, was adopted on 1 October 2012 and was introduced in Annex I of this Regulation<ref>European Commission website, Directorate General for Health and Food Safety. Retrieved on 6 May 2020: https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/food_improvement_agents/flavourings/eu_rules_en</ref>

===Regulations on natural flavoring===

In the EU, in order to be labelled as natural flavoring substance, many conditions have to be fulfilled: ‘Natural flavouring substance’ shall mean a flavouring substance obtained by appropriate physical, enzymatic or microbiological processes from material of vegetable, animal or microbiological origin either in the raw state or after processing for human consumption by one or more of the traditional food preparation processes listed in Annex II. Natural flavouring substances correspond to substances that are naturally present and have been identified in nature.<ref>Article 3 - Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on flavourings and certain food ingredients with flavouring properties for use in and on foods and amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 1601/91, Regulations (EC) No 2232/96 and (EC) No 110/2008 and Directive 2000/13/EC (Text with EEA relevance): https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32008R1334  [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]]  Text was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License].</ref>

More detailed information on the Production of Natural Flavouring Substances and (Natural) Flavouring Preparations can be found on the European Flavour Associarion (EFFA) Guidance Document<ref>EFFA Guidance Document for the Production of Natural Flavouring Substances and (Natural) Flavouring Preparations: https://effa.eu/docs/default-source/guidance-documents/effa-guidance-document-for-the-production-of-natural-flavouring-substances-and-(natural)-flavouring-preparations-in-the-eu6c53ae21f98c63ce9dbbff000087830d.pdf</ref>

[[UK]] Food Law defines a natural flavor as:
{{quote|A flavouring substance (or flavouring substances) which is (or are) obtained, by physical, enzymatic, or microbiological processes, from material of vegetable or animal origin which material is either raw or has been subjected to a process normally used in preparing food for human consumption and to no process other than one normally so used<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1994/uksi_19941486_en_1.htm|title=The Flavourings in Food (Amendment) Regulations 1994|website=www.opsi.gov.uk|access-date=3 February 2018}}</ref>}}

The UK follows the above EU legislation which remains in force until 31 December 2020. The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 provides that from 1 January 2021, this directly applicable EU legislation will be converted into UK law with minor corrections to enable it to operate effectively as UK law. These corrections have been made by Statutory Instrument 2019 No. 860.

The UK Food industry, in collaboration with the flavoring industry, has developed guidance on what to consider when declaring a pictorial representation of a food ingredient on the label of a pre-packed product.

The U.S. Code of Federal Regulations describes a "natural flavorant" as:
{{quote|The [[essential oil]], oleoresin, essence, or extractive, protein hydrolysate, [[distillate]], or any product of roasting, heating, or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit, or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf, or any other edible portions of a plant, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose primary function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2010-title21-vol2/xml/CFR-2010-title21-vol2-sec101-22.xml|title=Foods; labeling of spices, flavorings, colorings and chemical preservatives.|website=www.gpo.gov|access-date=3 February 2018}}</ref> }}

===Dietary restrictions===
Food manufacturers are sometimes reluctant to inform consumers about the source and identity of flavor ingredients and whether they have been produced with the incorporation of substances such as animal byproducts.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}  Some flavor ingredients, such as [[gelatin]], are produced from animal products.  Some, such as [[glycerin]] can be derived from either animal or vegetable sources.  And some extracts, such as vanilla, may contain alcohol. Many groups such as [[Jews]], [[Jainism|Jains]], [[Hindus]], and [[Muslims]], as well as [[vegans]] follow dietary restrictions which disallow the use of animal byproducts and/or alcohol in certain contexts.  In many Western countries, some consumers rely on a Jewish [[kosher]] [[pareve]] certification mark to indicate that natural flavorings used in a food product are free of meat and dairy (although they can still contain fish). The Vegan Society's Sunflower symbol (which is currently used by over 260 companies worldwide) can also be used to see which products do not use any animal ingredients (including flavorings and colorings).{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Similarly, persons with known [[Food sensitivity|sensitivities]] or [[Food allergy|allergies]] to food products are advised to avoid foods that contain generic "natural flavors" or to first determine the source of the flavoring before consuming the food.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2015/12/attention-allergy-sufferers-beware-of-natural-flavors|title=Attention, Allergy Sufferers: Beware of Natural Flavors |date=2 December 2015|publisher=Food Safety News|access-date=3 February 2018}}</ref> Such flavors may be derived from a variety of source products that are themselves common [[allergen]]s, such as [[Dairy allergy|dairy]], [[Soy allergy|soy]],<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.allergyadvisor.com/hidden.htm |publisher=Allergy Advisor |title=Hidden Allergens in Foods |access-date=2011-12-27 }}</ref> [[sesame#Allergy|sesame]],<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.kidswithfoodallergies.org/resourcespre.php?id=107 |publisher=Kids with Food Allergies Foundation |title=Sesame Allergy: A growing food allergy |access-date=2011-12-27 }}</ref> [[Egg allergy|eggs]], and [[Nut allergy|nuts]].<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.cspinet.org/nah/04_01/ |publisher=Center for Science in the Public Interest |title=Food Allergies |access-date=2011-12-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826044631/http://www.cspinet.org/nah/04_01/ |archive-date=2011-08-26 }}</ref>
In the EU, nevertheless, this information is available in the labelling. Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 on the provision of food information to consumers, states in article 9 that any ingredient or processing aid listed in Annex II (of the aforementioned Regulation) or derived from a substance or product listed in Annex II causing allergies or intolerances used in the manufacture or preparation of a food and still present in the finished product, even if in an altered form must be included in the labelling.<ref>Regulation (EU) no 1169/2011 of the European parliament and of the council of 25 October 2011</ref>

==Flavor creation==
[[food industry|Food]] and [[beverage industry|beverage]] companies may require flavors for new products, product line extensions (e.g., low fat versions of existing products), or changes in formula or processing for existing products. In 2011, about US$10.6 billion were generated with the sale of flavors; the majority of the flavors used are consumed in [[processed food|processed]] and [[packaged food]].<ref>Ceresana, market study Flavors, December 2012, http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/chemicals/flavors/</ref>

Most flavors represent a mixture of [[aroma compound]]s, the raw material that is produced by flavor companies. In rare cases, a single synthetic compound is used in pure form. Artificial [[vanilla flavor]]s [[vanillin]] and [[ethylvanillin]] are a notable exception, as well as the artificial [[strawberry]] flavor ([[ethyl methylphenylglycidate]]). The ubiquitous "green apple" aroma is based on [[hexyl acetate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/data/rw1003201.html|title=hexyl acetate, 142-92-7|first=William|last=Luebke|date=31 December 2017|website=www.thegoodscentscompany.com|access-date=3 February 2018}}</ref>

The flavor creation is done by a specially trained scientist called a "flavorist", whose job combines scientific knowledge of the chemical palette with creativity to develop new and distinctive flavors. The flavor creation begins when the flavorist receives a brief from the client. In the brief, the clients attempt to communicate exactly what type of flavor is sought, in what application it will be used, and any special requirements (e. g., it must be all natural). The communication barrier can be quite difficult to overcome since most people are not experienced at describing flavors. The flavorist uses his or her knowledge of the available chemical ingredients to create a formula and compound it on an electronic balance. The flavor is then submitted to the client for testing. Several iterations, with feedback from the client, may be needed before the right flavor is found.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Additional work may also be done by the flavor company.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} For example, the flavor company may conduct sensory taste tests to test consumer acceptance of a flavor before it is sent to the client or to further investigate the "sensory space". The flavor company may also employ application specialists who work to ensure the flavor will work in the application for which it is intended. This may require special flavor delivery technologies that are used to protect the flavor during processing or [[cooking]] so that the flavor is only released when eaten by the end consumer. The flavor obtained is determined not just by the simple presence of a flavorant or a mixture of flavorants, but also by their concentrations. Thus, even if a non-flavored ingredient is added/removed to/from a food or beverage, this can noticeably affect the final flavor if it dilutes or otherwise changes the concentrations of the remaining flavored ingredients.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==Determination==
Few standards are available or being prepared for sensory analysis of flavors.<ref>e.g. ISO 13301:2002 Sensory analysis – Methodology – General guidance for measuring odor, flavor and taste detection thresholds by a three-alternative forced-choice (3-AFC) procedure, or ISO 6564:1985 Sensory analysis – Methodology – Flavor profile methods.</ref> In [[Analytical chemistry|chemical analysis]] of flavors, [[solid phase extraction]], [[solid phase microextraction]], and headspace [[gas chromatography]] are applied to extract and separate the flavor compounds in the sample. The determination is typically done by various [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometric]] techniques.<ref>Use of Ozone Depleting Substances in Laboratories. TemaNord 2003:516.
