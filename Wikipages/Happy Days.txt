'''''Happy Days''''' is an American [[sitcom]] television series that aired first-run on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network from January 15, 1974, to July 19, 1984, with a total of 255 half-hour episodes spanning 11 seasons. Created by [[Garry Marshall]], the series was one of the most successful of the 1970s, a sweet vision of life in the 1950s and early 1960s [[Midwestern United States]], and starred [[Ron Howard]] as [[Richie Cunningham]], [[Henry Winkler]] as his friend [[Fonzie]], and [[Tom Bosley]] and [[Marion Ross]] as Richie's parents, Howard and Marion Cunningham.<ref name="Happy Days Actor Tom Bosley Dies">{{cite news|title= Happy Days Actor Tom Bosley Dies|work= Baltimore Sun|url= http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/tv/ktla-tom-bosley-obit,0,3802680.story|access-date= October 19, 2010|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101022010008/http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/tv/ktla-tom-bosley-obit,0,3802680.story|archive-date= October 22, 2010}}</ref> Although it opened to mixed reviews from critics, ''Happy Days'' became successful and popular over time.<ref name=vanderwerff>{{cite web |url=https://www.avclub.com/article/ihappy-daysi-became-one-of-the-biggest-hits-on-tv--84232 |title=Happy Days became one of the biggest hits on TV by selling its soul |last=VanDerWerff |first=Emily |date=August 27, 2012 |website=[[The A.V.

The series began as an unsold pilot starring Howard, Ross and [[Anson Williams]], which aired in 1972 as a segment titled "Love and the Television Set" (later retitled "Love and the Happy Days" for syndication) on ABC's anthology show ''[[Love, American Style]]''. Based on the pilot, director [[George Lucas]] cast Howard as the lead in his 1973 film ''[[American Graffiti]]'', causing ABC to take a renewed interest in the pilot. The first two seasons of ''Happy Days'' focused on the experiences and dilemmas of "innocent teenager" Richie Cunningham, his family, and his high school friends, attempting to "honestly depict a wistful look back at adolescence".<ref name=vanderwerff/> 

Initially a moderate success, the series' ratings began to fall during its second season, causing Marshall to retool it emphasizing broad comedy and spotlighting the previously minor character of Fonzie, a "cool" [[Motorcycling#Subcultures|biker]] and high school dropout.<ref name=vanderwerff/> Following these changes, ''Happy Days'' became the number-one program in television in 1976–1977, Fonzie became one of the most merchandised characters of the 1970s, and Henry Winkler became a major star.<ref name=brooks>{{cite book |last1=Brooks |first1=Tim |last2=Marsh |first2=Earle |date=2007 |title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946 – Present |edition=9th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w8KztFy6QYwC&pg=PA581 |location=New York |publisher=Ballantine Books |pages=580–582 |isbn=9780307483201 }}</ref><ref name=crupi >{{cite web |url=http://adage.com/article/special-report-tv-upfront/broadcast-tv-ratings/308959/ |title=Happy Days for broadcasters* *as long as they're selling sports |last=Crupi |first=Anthony |date=May 2017 |website=adage.com |publisher=Advertising Age |access-date=June 12, 2017}}</ref> The series also spawned a number of [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s, including ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' and ''[[Mork & Mindy]]''.

== Plot ==
Set in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]] during the 1950's, the series revolves around teenager [[Richie Cunningham]] and his family: his father, Howard, who owns a hardware store; traditional homemaker and mother, Marion; younger sister [[Joanie Cunningham]]; Richie's older brother Chuck (briefly in seasons 1 and 2 only, disappearing from storylines afterward); and high school dropout, [[Greaser (subculture)|greaser]], and suave ladies' man [[Fonzie]], who would eventually become Richie's best friend and the Cunninghams' over-the-garage tenant. The earlier episodes revolve around Richie and his friends, [[Potsie Weber]] and [[Ralph Malph]], with Fonzie as a secondary character. However, as the series progressed, Fonzie proved to be a favorite with viewers, and soon more story lines were written to reflect his growing popularity; Winkler eventually received top billing in the opening credits alongside Howard.<ref>{{cite news|title=Is Uncool Urkel the '90s Answer to the Fonz?|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 4, 1991|url=http://articlthelatimes.com/1991-01-04/entertainment/ca-7948_1_family-matters/2|access-date=November 7, 2010|first=Diane|last=Haithman}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Fonzie befriended Richie and the Cunningham family, and when Richie left the series for military service, Fonzie became the central figure of the show, with Winkler receiving sole top billing. In later seasons, other characters were introduced including Fonzie's young cousin, [[Chachi Arcola]], who became a love interest for Joanie Cunningham. 

The series' pilot was originally shown as ''Love and the Television Set'', later retitled ''Love and the Happy Days'' for syndication, a one-episode teleplay on the anthology series ''[[Love, American Style]]'', aired on February 25, 1972. ''Happy Days'' spawned successful television shows ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' and ''[[Mork & Mindy]]'' as well as three failures, ''[[Joanie Loves Chachi]]'', ''[[Blansky's Beauties]]'' featuring Nancy Walker as Howard's cousin,<ref>{{cite web|title=Blansky's Beauties|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/blanskys-beauties/|work=TV.com|access-date=April 27, 2012}}</ref> and ''[[Out of the Blue (1979 TV series)|Out of the Blue]]''. The show is the basis for the [[Happy Days (musical)|''Happy Days'' musical]] touring the United States since 2008. The leather jacket worn by Winkler during the series was acquired by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] for the permanent collection at the [[National Museum of American History]].<ref>{{cite news|title= How Now, Mr. Fonzarelli?|work= People Magazine|url= http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20110141,00.html|access-date=October 20, 2010}}</ref> The original tan McGregor windbreaker Winkler wore during the first season was eventually thrown into the garbage after ABC relented and allowed the Fonzie character to wear a leather jacket.

=== Main ===
* [[Richie Cunningham]] – The [[protagonist]] for the first seven years of the series (1974–80). When [[Ron Howard]] left the show due to his burgeoning directorial career, Richie was written out by leaving to join the [[United States Army]].

* [[Marion Cunningham (Happy Days)|Marion Cunningham]] – Wife of Howard Cunningham, mother of Richie and Joanie, and a traditional [[Homemaking|homemaker]]. She is the only character who is allowed to call Fonzie by his real first name, Arthur, which she does affectionately.<ref>{{cite news|title= Marion Ross on 'Happy Days' and today|work=Los Angeles Times|date=October 7, 2009|url= https://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/07/entertainment/et-classic-hollywood7|access-date=October 19, 2010|first=Susan|last=King}}{{better source needed|date=March 2013}}</ref> She sometimes gets tired of being at home, such as in "Marion Rebels" where she gets into an argument with Howard and briefly gets a job as a waitress at Arnold's.<ref>{{cite web|title=Happy Days Episode Guide 1977 Season 4- Marion Rebels|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/happy-days-1977/episode-15-season-4/marion-rebels/100197|publisher=tvguide.com|access-date=November 8, 2012}}</ref> In "Empty Nest" when Joanie left for Chicago to pursue her music career, Marion had "empty nest syndrome" and was thrilled when her and Howard's niece, K.C., moved in with them.<ref>{{cite web|title=Happy Days Episodes- Happy Days Full Episode Guides from Season 10 on ABC|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/happy-days/episodes-season-10/100197|publisher=tvguide.com|access-date=November 8, 2012}}</ref> Marion was one of only four characters to remain with the show throughout its entire run.
* [[Howard Cunningham (Happy Days)|Howard Cunningham]] – Husband of Marion Cunningham, father of Richie and Joanie, business owner of a hardware store called "Cunningham's Hardware", he is a lodge member, and family man. Frequently seen reading the daily newspaper in his easy chair.<ref name="Happy Days Actor Tom Bosley Dies"/> Enjoys driving his beloved 1948 [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] Suburban. In "Letting Go", he did not want Joanie to go to Chicago, still seeing her as his "little girl". But after talking with Fonzie and realizing how much she has grown up, he supports her going.<ref>{{cite web|title=Happy Days Episode- Happy Days Full Episode Guides from Season 10 on ABC|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/happy-days/episodes-season-10/100197|publisher=tvguide.com|access-date=November 8, 2012}}</ref> In "Passages", Howard says that he is proud of Richie and Joanie in Joanie and Chachi's wedding. Howard is one of only two characters (the other being Fonzie) to appear in every episode of the series.
* [[Joanie Cunningham]] – Richie's younger sister. In early seasons, she is sometimes snooping on Richie's activities and would occasionally be sent to her room by her parents. She is affectionately called "Shortcake" by Fonzie. Later on, Joanie briefly joins a motorcycle gang after going on a date with a boy, whom she considered to be "dull". In "Smokin' Ain't Cool", Joanie started smoking in order to be in a cool club, until Fonzie sets her straight. For years, Fonzie's cousin, Chachi, had been chasing her until she eventually agreed to a date with him. She and Chachi would eventually form a band together; and in "Letting Go", they leave for Chicago to pursue their music career (which [[spin-off (media)|spun off]] the short-lived series ''[[Joanie Loves Chachi]]''). Joanie, however, eventually left the band to return home to pursue a teaching career.<ref>{{cite web|title=Happy Days Episode Guide 1983 Season 10- Turn Around...and You're Home|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/happy-days-1983/episode-21-season-10/turn-aroundand-youre-home/100197|publisher=tvguide.com|access-date=November 8, 2012}}</ref> She and Chachi then broke up for a time until Chachi proposes to her and they get married in the series finale.
* [[Fonzie|Arthur Fonzarelli]], a.k.a. The Fonz or Fonzie – Initially a minor character, he was a hugely popular [[breakout character]] and was made a series regular. Fonzarelli's "Fonzie" nickname and comeback phrase, "Sit on it," were created by the show's producer, [[Bob Brunner]].<ref name=variety>{{cite news|title=Bob Brunner, 'Happy Days' writer, dies |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118061908?refCatId=14 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=November 8, 2012 |access-date=November 27, 2012}}</ref><ref name=dspy>{{cite news|title=Bob Brunner, 'Happy Days' writer and producer, dies aged 78 |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/celebrity/news/a436565/bob-brunner-happy-days-writer-and-producer-dies-aged-78.html |work=[[Digital Spy]] |date=November 7, 2012 |access-date=November 27, 2012}}</ref><ref name=thr>{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Barnes|title='Happy Days' Writer-Producer Bob Brunner Dies at 78 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bob-brunner-happy-days-jump-the-shark-387593 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=November 7, 2012 |access-date=November 27, 2012}}</ref> Known for being especially [[Cool (aesthetic)#As a behavioral characteristic|cool]] and for his [[catchphrase]]s "(H)eyyyy!" and "Whoa!" His coolness gave him special powers, such as making machinery (such as Arnold's jukebox and other vending machines, electric lights, and car engines) function by pounding on them with his fist, or getting the attention of girls by snapping his fingers. His parents abandoned him as a child and his grandmother raised him from the age of four.
* [[Potsie Weber]] – Richie's best friend and an aspiring talented singer. He is somewhat more carefree and worldly than Richie in early seasons, then in mid-seasons, he becomes more often paired with Ralph for plots, and the two became inseparable. In later seasons, his character evolves to increasingly emphasize his dimwitted side, and Ralph would often say to him "You're such a Potsie". Potsie often lightheartedly mentioned the supposed hatred his father (who never appeared on the show) had for him. Potsie remained with the show after Richie and Ralph joined the Army; however, he was seen less frequently. While Potsie's character became underdeveloped in these later episodes (and he, along with Ralph, was one of the few characters absent from the finale), he is mentioned to regularly bowl with the Cunninghams and still continues his position as assistant manager of Cunningham Hardware, and as pledge master of the Leopard Lodge.
* [[Ralph Malph]] – In the first season, Ralph was more of a side character to plots, but when Most became a main cast member in season two, Ralph was more commonly seen, and he, Richie, and Potsie (these two also later became roommates) became the three amigos. Known for saying "I still got it!" after delivering one of his jokes. Ralph left with Richie after the 1979–80 season to join the Army. Malph returned as a guest star in the final season, although he is absent in the finale (along with Potsie)—he is mentioned as having left to continue college to become an optometrist like his father.
* [[Chachi Arcola]] – Fonzie's younger cousin and later Al Delvecchio's stepson. Chachi is very close to his older cousin Fonzie. Fonzie acts as the older brother figure that Chachi needs. Chachi has a similar personality to his older cousin. He has Fonzie's smoothness and charisma, but Chachi is more laidback. Chachi becomes "one of the guys" as he gets older, joining Richie, Potsie, Ralph, and Fonzie in their antics. After Richie and Ralph leave the show, Chachi and Fonzie often have plots together. Chachi has a crush on Joanie Cunningham from the moment he meets her in season 5, but she initially thinks of him as a little kid, calling him names like "shrimp", "drip", etc. But as they enter high school, she too begins to find him attractive. In season 11, they broke up for a short period. But as the season progresses, they get back together and Chachi eventually proposes to Joanie and she says yes. The series finale features Chachi and Joanie's wedding.
* [[Al Delvecchio]] – From seasons four to nine (1976–82), Al became the new owner/cook of the drive-in after Arnold got married the previous season. Al later married Chachi's mother Louisa, thereby becoming Chachi's stepfather and Fonzie's uncle. Molinaro left ''Happy Days'' in 1982 to take his "Al" character to ''[[Joanie Loves Chachi]]'', and returned as Al in three later episodes of ''Happy Days''. Known for sighing "Yeeep, yep, yep, yep, yep" when he was disappointed or when things did not go his way.
* Mitsumo "Arnold" Takahashi ([[Noriyuki "Pat" Morita]]) (seasons 3, 10–11: 26 episodes) depicted the owner of Arnold's Drive-In for season three (1975–76). He stated that he obtained the moniker when he purchased Arnold's restaurant and people thought it was named after him, explaining that it was too costly to buy enough letter signs needed to rename it "Takahashi". He moonlighted as a martial arts instructor, teaching self-defense classes at the drive-in after hours. Morita also played "Arnold" as a guest star in 1977 and 1979 before returning as a recurring character after [[Al Molinaro]] departed in 1982.
* {{vanchor|Jenny Piccolo|Jenny Piccalo}} (also Jenny Piccalo) – Joanie's boy-crazy best friend (1980–83), frequently mentioned but never seen in early episodes. She made her first on-screen appearance in the eighth season and remained a recurring character through the ninth season, becoming a regular during the tenth season in 1983. She returned as a guest star in the 1984 series finale.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metv.com/stories/cathy-silvers-is-so-much-like-jenny-piccalo-that-it-s-frightening|title = Cathy Silvers is so much like Jenny Piccalo that ''it's frightening''}}</ref> Jenny's father, played by [[Cathy Silvers]]' real-life father [[Phil Silvers]], appeared in one episode.
* Roger Phillips ([[Ted McGinley]]) – Marion's nephew; coach and teacher at Jefferson High, until "Vocational Education" where he became principal at Patton High.<ref>{{cite web|title=Happy Days Episodes Guide 1983 Season 11- Vocational Education, Episode 7|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/happy-days-1983/episode-7-season-11/vocational-education/100197|publisher=tvguide.com|access-date=November 8, 2012}}</ref> Introduced in 1980 after Richie left the show as a recurring character.
* Lori Beth Allen-Cunningham ([[Lynda Goodfriend]]) – Richie's girlfriend and later his wife (1977–82). She married Richie by phone in season eight. Fonzie helped Lori Beth deliver her baby in "Little Baby Cunningham". She returned as a guest star in the final season, where she is revealed to be pregnant with her second baby.
* Ashley Pfister ([[Linda Purl]]) – Divorced mother who becomes Fonzie's steady girlfriend until they broke up offscreen sometime before "Where the Guys Are". Purl also played as Richie's part-time girlfriend Gloria in season 2.

=== {{anchor|Chuck Cunningham Syndrome}} Minor/recurring ===
* Marsha Simms ([[Beatrice Colen]]) (seasons 1–3, 5; 22 episodes) – A [[carhop]] in the first two seasons. Appeared in the background of a few episodes during the first and second seasons before disappearing from the show in the third season. However, she later returned for a flashback guest appearance in the episode "Our Gang".
* Bobby Melner (Harris Kal) (seasons 8–11; 19 episodes) – Friend of Chachi and Joanie seen in episodes after Richie and Ralph left the show. He is a student in Fonzie's auto shop class, as well as in Roger's health class. At one point, he was also on the Jefferson High basketball team, and performed in a band with Joanie and Chachi.
* K.C. Cunningham ([[Crystal Bernard]]) (season 10; 15 episodes) – Howard's niece. She moved in with Howard and Marion after Joanie left for Chicago.

''Happy Days'' originated during a time of 1950s [[nostalgic]] interest as evident in 1970s film, television, and music. In late winter of 1971, [[Michael Eisner]] was snowed in at Newark airport where he bumped into Tom Miller, head of development at Paramount. Eisner has stated that he told Miller, "Tom, this is ridiculous. We're wasting our time here. Let's write a show." The script treatment that came out of that did not sell. But in spite of the market research department telling them that the 1950s theme would not work, they decided to redo it, and this was accepted as a pilot.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5esuQOE69s Michael Eisner on the development of "Happy Days"] with EmmyTvLegends.org (posted to YouTube on Nov8, 2011)<br/>Note: Eisner states that snowstorm happened when his son was three months old.  [[Breck Eisner]] was born on December 24, 1970, so this means that the first treatment was written in late winter of 1970 (~March or April).</ref> This unsold pilot was filmed in late 1971 and titled ''New Family in Town,'' with [[Harold Gould]] in the role of Howard Cunningham, [[Marion Ross]] as Marion, [[Ron Howard]] as Richie, [[Anson Williams]] as Potsie, [[Ric Carrott]] as Charles "Chuck" Cunningham, and [[Susan Neher]] as Joanie. [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] passed on making it into a weekly series, and the pilot was recycled with the title ''Love and the Television Set'' (later retitled ''Love and the Happy Days'' for syndication), for presentation on the television [[anthology series]] ''[[Love, American Style]].''<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioDxCd4tfn8&t=28s Charles Fox discusses writing the Happy Days theme] with EmmyTvLegends.org (posted to YouTube on June 16, 2015)</ref> Also in 1971, the musical [[Grease (musical)#Original productions and Broadway|Grease]] had a successful opening in Chicago, and by the following year became successful on Broadway. Also in 1972, [[George Lucas]] asked to view the pilot to determine if Ron Howard would be suitable to play a teenager in ''[[American Graffiti]],'' then in pre-production. Lucas immediately cast Howard in the film, which became one of the top-grossing films of 1973. With the movie's success generating a renewed interest in the 1950s era (although, the film was set in 1962), TV show creator [[Garry Marshall]] and ABC recast the unsold pilot to turn ''Happy Days'' into a series. According to Marshall in an interview, executive producer [[Thomas L. Miller|Tom Miller]] said while developing the sitcom, "If we do a TV series that takes place in another era, and when it goes into reruns, then it won't look old." This made sense to Marshall while on the set of the show.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTDz6nDJh2E&t=1m42s Garry Marshall discusses creating Happy Days] with EmmyTvLegends.org (posted to YouTube on July 13, 2012)</ref>

Gould had originally been tapped to reprise the role of Howard Cunningham on the show. However, during a delay before the start of production he found work doing a play abroad and when he was notified the show was ready to begin production, he declined to return because he wanted to honor his commitment.<ref>{{cite news|last=McLellan|first=Dennis|title=Harold Gould dies at 86; veteran character actor|url=https://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-harold-gould-20100914,0,1952380.story|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=September 14, 2010}}</ref> Bosley was then offered the role.

* Producer and writer [[Bob Brunner]] created Arthur Fonzarelli's "Fonzie" nickname and his iconic comeback phrase, "Sit on it."<ref name="variety"/><ref name="dspy"/><ref name="thr"/>
* Beginning in September 1979 until the show went out of production, reruns of the show were [[television syndication|syndicated]] under the title ''Happy Days Again''.
* ''Happy Days'' was produced by Miller-Milkis Productions, a teaming of Thomas L. Miller with former film editor Edward K. Milkis, which became Miller-Milkis-Boyett Productions when Robert L. Boyett joined the company in 1980, and was the first-ever show to be produced by the company's most recent incarnation, [[Miller-Boyett Productions]], which followed Milkis's resignation from the partnership. It was also produced by Henderson Productions and was one of the popular shows produced in association with [[Paramount Television]].
* In its 11 seasons on the air, ''Happy Days'' is the second-longest-running sitcom in [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s history (behind ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]],'' which ran 14 seasons, from 1952 to 1966), and one of the longest-running primetime programs in the network's history. It is also unique in that it remained in the same time slot, leading off ABC's Tuesday night programming at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]]/[[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific]] (7:00&nbsp;p.m. in the [[Central Time Zone|Central]] and [[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]] zones) for its first ten seasons. That half-hour became a signature timeslot for ABC, with ''[[Who's the Boss?]]'' instantly entering the top 10 when it was moved from Thursdays and staying in that time slot for six seasons, followed by the equally family-friendly sitcom ''[[Full House]]'' (another Miller-Boyett co-production). That sitcom also hit the top 10 immediately after inheriting the Tuesday at 8:00/7:00&nbsp;p.m. slot and then stayed there for four seasons.
* ''Happy Days'' also proved to be quite popular in daytime reruns; they joined the ABC daytime schedule in 1975, airing reruns at 11:30&nbsp;a.m. ET (10:30&nbsp;a.m. CT/MT/PT), being moved to 11:00/10:00&nbsp;a.m. in 1977, paired with ''[[Family Feud]]'' following at 11:30/10:30&nbsp;a.m. It was replaced on the daytime schedule by reruns of its spin-off, ''Laverne & Shirley,'' in April 1979.
* [[CBS]] programming head [[Fred Silverman]] scheduled the ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'' spin-off ''[[Good Times]]'' directly against ''Happy Days'' during their respective second seasons in an attempt to kill the ABC show's growing popularity. In a way this move backfired on Silverman, as he was named president of ABC in 1975, thus forcing him to come up with a way to save the show he tried to kill the year before. After having knocked ''Happy Days'' out of the top 20 programs on television his last year at CBS, Silverman had the series at the top of the [[Nielsen ratings]] by 1977 (see below). ''Good Times'' was later cancelled in 1979.
* Ron Howard later revealed that many of the exterior scenes filmed in ''Happy Days'' were actually shot in [[Munster, Indiana]].
* The official series finale ("Passages") aired on May 8, 1984. But there were five "leftover" episodes that ABC didn't have time to air during the regular season due to the [[1984 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]] and the spring run of ''[[a.k.a. Pablo]]''. Four of these aired on Thursday nights during the summer of 1984; the fifth ("Fonzie's Spots") aired on September 24, 1984.

==== Production styles ====
The first two seasons of ''Happy Days'' (1974–75) were filmed using a [[single-camera setup]] and [[laugh track]]. One episode of season two ("Fonzie Gets Married") was filmed in front of a studio audience with [[Multiple-camera setup|three cameras]] as a test run. From the third season on (1975–84), the show was a three-camera production in front of a live audience (with a cast member, usually Tom Bosley, announcing in voice-over, ''"Happy Days'' is filmed before a live audience" at the start of most episodes), giving these later seasons a markedly different style. A laugh track was still used during post-production to smooth over live reactions.

Garry Marshall's earlier television series ''[[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]'' had undergone an identical change in production style after its first season in 1970–71.

==== Sets ====
[[File:Happy days 1976 fonzies apartment.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Richie and Fonzie view his destroyed motorcycle in his living room, 1976. Fonzie's apartment was over the Cunninghams' garage.]]

The show had two main sets: the Cunningham home and Arnold's/Al's [[Drive-In]].

In seasons one and two, the Cunningham house was arranged with the front door on the left and the kitchen on the right of screen, in a triangular arrangement. From season three on, the house was rearranged to accommodate multiple cameras and a studio audience.

The Cunninghams' official address is 565 North Clinton Drive, [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]].<ref>''Wilcox's Soaps & More TV Character Address and Trivia Book'' (2004)</ref> The house that served as the exterior of the Cunningham residence is actually located at 565 North Cahuenga Boulevard (south of Melrose Avenue) in Los Angeles,<ref>{{cite web |title=Iconic Movie and TV Houses of L.A. |url=https://www.laweekly.com/slideshow/iconic-movie-and-tv-houses-of-la-5023914 |website=LA Weekly | date=2014-08-21}}</ref> several blocks from the Paramount lot on Melrose Avenue.

The Milky Way Drive-In, located on Port Washington Road in the North Shore suburb of [[Glendale, Wisconsin]] (now [[Kopp's Frozen Custard]] Stand), was the inspiration for the original Arnold's Drive-In; it has since been demolished. The exterior of Arnold's was a standing set on the Paramount Studios lot that has since been demolished. This exterior was close to Stage 19, where the rest of the show's sets were located.

The set of the diner in the first season was a room with the same vague details of the later set, such as the paneling, and the college pennants. When the show changed to a studio production in 1975, the set was widened and the entrance was hidden, but allowed an upstage, central entrance for cast members. The barely-seen kitchen was also upstaged and seen only through a pass-through window. The diner had orange booths, downstage center for closeup conversation, as well as camera left. There were two restroom doors camera right, labeled "Guys" and "Dolls". A 1953 [[Seeburg Corporation|Seeburg]] Model G jukebox (with replaced metal [[pilaster]]s from Wico Corp.) was positioned camera right, and an [[anachronism|anachronistic]] "Nip-It" pinball machine (actually produced in 1972) was positioned far camera right.
[[File:Happy days at arnolds 1975.JPG|thumb|Potsie, Richie, Fonzie, and Ralph Malph at Arnold's]]

College pennants adorned the walls, including [[Purdue University|Purdue]] and [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]], along with a blue and white sign reading "Jefferson High School". [[Washington High School (Milwaukee)|Milwaukee's Washington High School]] provided the inspiration for the exteriors of the fictional Jefferson.

In a two-part episode from the seventh season, the original Arnold's Drive-In was written out of the series as being destroyed by fire (see [[List of Happy Days episodes|List of ''Happy Days'' episodes]], episodes 159 and 160). In the last seasons that covered the 1960s timeline, a new Arnold's Drive-In set (to portray the new Arnold's that replaced the original Arnold's destroyed by the fire) emerged in a 1960s decor with wood paneling and stained glass. Also, in seasons 8 and 9, the new drive-in was named "Fonzie & Big Al" because Fonzie and Al co-owned the new establishment in a [[partnership]].

In 2004, two decades after the first set was destroyed, the ''Happy Days 30th Anniversary Reunion'' requested that the reunion take place in Arnold's. The set was rebuilt by production designer James Yarnell based on the original floor plan. The reunion special was taped at [[CBS Television City]]'s Bob Barker Studio in September 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbstelevisioncity.com/shows# |title=Shows |publisher=CBS Television City |date=September 7, 1954 |access-date=June 4, 2014}}</ref>

=== Theme music ===
{{Main|Happy Days (TV theme)}}
Season one used a newly recorded version of "[[Rock Around the Clock]]" by [[Bill Haley & His Comets]] (recorded in the fall of 1973) as the opening theme song. This recording was not commercially released at the time, although the original 1954 recording returned to the American [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] charts in 1974 as a result of the song's use on the show. The "Happy Days" recording had its first commercial release in 2005 by the German label Hydra Records. (When ''Happy Days'' entered [[television syndication|syndication]] in 1979, the series was retitled ''Happy Days Again'' and used an edited version of the 1954 recording instead of the 1973 version.) In some prints intended for reruns and overseas broadcasts, as well as on the Season 2 DVD set release and later re-releases of the Season 1 DVD set, the original "Rock Around the Clock" opening theme is replaced by the more standard "Happy Days" theme, because of music rights issues.

The show's closing theme song in seasons one and two was a fragment from "Happy Days" (although in a different recording with a different lyric from that which would become the standard version), whose music was composed by [[Charles Fox (composer)|Charles Fox]] and whose lyric was written by [[Norman Gimbel]]. According to SAG, this version was performed by [[Jim Haas]] on lead vocals, [[The Ron Hicklin Singers]], Stan Farber, Jerry Whitman, and Gary Garrett on backing vocals, and studio musicians.

From seasons three to ten inclusive, a longer version of "Happy Days" replaced "Rock Around the Clock" at the beginning of the show. Released as a single in 1976 by [[Pratt & McClain]], "Happy Days" cracked the Top 5. The show itself finished the 1976–77 television season at No. 1, ending the five-year [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] reign of ''[[All in the Family]]''.

For the show's 11th and final season (1983–84), the theme was rerecorded in a more modern style. It featured Bobby Arvon on lead vocals, with several back-up vocalists. To accompany this new version, new opening credits were filmed, and the flashing ''Happy Days'' logo was reanimated to create an overall "new" feel which incorporated 1980s sensibilities with 1950s nostalgia (although by this time the show was set in 1965).

=== Merchandising revenue lawsuit ===
On April 19, 2011, ''Happy Days'' co-stars Erin Moran, Don Most, Marion Ross and Anson Williams, as well as the estate of Tom Bosley (who died in 2010), filed a $10 million breach-of-contract lawsuit against CBS, which owns the show, claiming they had not been paid for merchandising revenues owed under their contracts.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dobuzinskis |first=Alex |title='Happy Days' actors sue over merchandising revenue|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-56450420110420 |publisher=Reuters |date=April 20, 2011}}</ref> The cast members claimed they had not received revenues from show-related items, including comic books, T-shirts, scrapbooks, trading cards, games, lunch boxes, dolls, toy cars, magnets, greeting cards and DVDs where their images appear on the box covers. Under their contracts, they were supposed to be paid 5% of the net proceeds of merchandising if their sole image were used, and half that amount if they were in a group. CBS said it owed the actors $8,500 and $9,000 each, most of it from slot machine revenues, but the group said they were owed millions.<ref>{{cite news|last=Zamost|first=Scott|title='Happy Days' actors claim fraud, money owed for merchandising |url=https://money.cnn.com/2011/04/19/news/companies/happy_days_fraud_claim/ |newspaper=CNNMoney|date=April 20, 2011}}</ref> The lawsuit was initiated after Ross was informed by a friend playing slots at a casino of a ''Happy Days'' machine on which players win the jackpot when five Marion Rosses are rolled.

In October 2011, a judge rejected the group's fraud claim, which meant they could not receive millions of dollars in potential damages.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gardner |first=Eriq |title='Happy Days' Actors Win Key Ruling in CBS Lawsuit|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/happy-days-cbs-merchandising-lawsuit-333369 |newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=June 5, 2012}}</ref> On June 5, 2012, a judge denied a motion filed by CBS to have the case thrown out, which meant it would go to trial on July 17 if the matter was not settled by then.<ref>{{cite news|last=Scott|first=Zamost|title='Happy Days' cast members' lawsuit heading for trial|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/05/showbiz/happy-days-lawsuit/index.html |work=CNN|date=June 5, 2012}}</ref> In July 2012, the actors settled their lawsuit with CBS.

In 1985,  [[Jon Hein]] developed the phrase [[jumping the shark]] in response to an episode of ''Happy Days,'' (Season 5, Episode 91) called "[[Happy Days (season 5)#ep91|Hollywood: Part 3]], written by Fred Fox, Jr.<ref name="Fox">{{cite news |title=First Person: In defense of 'Happy Days' 'Jump the Shark' episode |first=Fred |last=Fox, Jr. |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-jump-the-shark-20100903,0,6800871.story |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 3, 2010}}</ref> which aired on September 20, 1977.

== Reunion specials ==
There have been two reunion specials which aired on ABC: the first was ''[[List_of_Happy_Days_episodes#Reunion_specials|The Happy Days Reunion Special]]'' originally aired in March 1992, followed by ''[[List_of_Happy_Days_episodes#Reunion_specials|Happy Days: 30th Anniversary Reunion]]'' in February 2005 to commemorate the program's 30th anniversary. Both were set up in interview/clip format.

== Spin-offs ==
''Happy Days'' resulted in seven different spin-off series, including two that were animated: ''[[Laverne & Shirley]],'' ''[[Blansky's Beauties]],'' ''[[Mork & Mindy]],'' ''[[Out of the Blue (1979 TV series)|Out of the Blue]],'' ''[[Joanie Loves Chachi]],'' ''[[The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang]]'' (animated) and ''[[Mork & Mindy/Laverne & Shirley/Fonz Hour#Laverne & Shirley with The Fonz|Laverne & Shirley with The Fonz]]'' (animated).
* The most successful of these spin-offs, ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' (1976–83) starring [[Penny Marshall]] and [[Cindy Williams]], respectively, also took place in early/mid-1960s [[Milwaukee]]. As Shotz Brewery workers, modeled after the Miller, Schlitz, and Pabst Breweries once located in Milwaukee, Laverne and Shirley find themselves in adventures with The Fonz, Lenny and Squiggy and even the Cunninghams also living in the midwestern city. The two starring characters eventually moved to Los Angeles in the show's later years. Penny Marshall was the sister of producer [[Garry Marshall]]. ''Happy Days'' and ''Laverne & Shirley'' had a crossover episode, "Shotgun Wedding", in which Richie and Fonzie get into trouble with a farmer for courting his daughters, and Laverne and Shirley try to help them. Part one is the season seven premiere of ''Happy Days'' and part two is the season five premiere of ''Laverne & Shirley''.
* After [[Robin Williams]] appeared as Mork in "[[My Favorite Orkan]]", he was given his own sitcome, ''[[Mork & Mindy]]'' (1978–82). In this series, Mork is an alien from the planet Ork, who lands in 1970s [[Boulder, Colorado]], to study humans. He moves in with [[Pam Dawber]]'s character of Mindy McConnell. 
* ''[[Joanie Loves Chachi]]'' (1982–83) was a short-lived show about Richie's younger sister Joanie and Fonzie's younger cousin Chachi's relationship during their years as musicians in Chicago. While commonly believed that the show was canceled due to low ratings, the program finished in the Top 20 its first season, but ABC determined that the show was losing too much of its lead-in, suggesting low appeal if the show were moved (a suggestion that came to be realized, as the show's ratings dropped dramatically after a move to another time slot in its second season). This type of cancellation seemed strange in the early 1980s, but soon became a commonplace part of TV audience research.
* ''[[Out of the Blue (1979 TV series)|Out of the Blue]]'' (1979) is a spin-off of ''Happy Days,'' though a scheduling error had the series airing prior to the main character's introduction on ''Happy Days.''
* ''Blansky's Beauties'' (1977) starred [[Nancy Walker]] as former Las Vegas showgirl Nancy Blansky. One week before the show's premiere, the Blansky character appeared on ''Happy Days'' as a cousin of Howard Cunningham. [[Scott Baio]] and [[Lynda Goodfriend]] co-starred before joining ''Happy Days'' the following fall, and [[Pat Morita]] reprised his role of Arnold. Similarly, [[Eddie Mekka]] of ''Laverne & Shirley'' played the cousin of his Carmine character, while pulling double duty as a regular in both shows.

Spin-off pilots that did not succeed include ''The Ralph and Potsie Show'' as well as ''The Pinky Tuscadero Show''.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioDxCd4tfn8&t=2m25s Charles Fox interview] with EmmyTvLegends.org (posted to YouTube on June 16, 2015)</ref>
