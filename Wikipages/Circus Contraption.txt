'''Circus Contraption''' (founded in 1998) was the name of a one-ring [[circus]], [[vaudeville]] and [[dark cabaret]] troupe based in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. The troupe, which employs about a dozen performers, uses live, original music paired with old-style circus performances, heavily influenced by cabaret and vaudeville acts. The shows are conceived for adults and usually feature some mature content.

The troupe first performed at the Seattle Fringe Theatre Festival, but soon branched out to other venues around the U.S., including a U.S. tour in 2005.  Their local and touring shows, with names like "Bracing Curative," "Eat Circus," "The Beer, Bread & Cheese Cabaret," "A Raree Show," and "Gallimaufry: An Evening of Jiggery-Pokery," played to sold-out audiences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://circuscontraption.com/shows.html|title=Circus Contraption: Shows|website=circuscontraption.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref>

The troupe disbanded in 2009.  Joe Albanese (aka Dexter Mantooth) and Drew Keriakedes (aka Shmootzi the Clod) and three other victims were killed in the [[2012_Seattle_cafe_shooting_spree|Cafe Racer shooting]] on May 30, 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2012/05/31/the-thursday-morning-news|title=Morning News: Cafe Racer Massacre and the Aftermath|author=Dominic Holden|website=Slog.thestranger.com|accessdate=17 September 2020}}</ref>
