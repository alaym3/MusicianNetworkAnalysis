'''Youth of Today''' is an American [[hardcore punk]] band, initially active from 1985 to 1990 before reforming in 2010. The band played a major role in establishing the "[[Youth Crew]]" [[punk subculture|subculture]] of hardcore, both espousing and evolving the philosophies of the [[straight edge]] and [[vegetarian]] lifestyles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.fortunecity.com/youthoftoday/Interviews/interv4.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 10, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040704125825/http://members.fortunecity.com/youthoftoday/Interviews/interv4.htm |archive-date=July 4, 2004 }}</ref>

After the band's dissolution, vocalist [[Ray Cappo]] became involved in the [[Krishnacore|Hare Krishna movement]] and formed the bands [[Shelter (band)|Shelter]] and [[Better Than a Thousand]]. Youth of Today is currently composed of Cappo and guitarist [[John Porcelly]], both founding members, as well as bassist Walter Schreifels and drummer Sammy Siegler.

==History==
Youth Of Today was formed in Danbury, Connecticut in 1985 by two members of the [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] band Violent Children, [[Ray Cappo]] (vocals) and [[John Porcelly]] (Porcell) (guitar) were aiming to start a [[Straight Edge]] band at a time when most old school straight edge bands had disbanded. Having difficulty finding a bassist and drummer, Ray and Porcell found help from two high school friends, Graham Phillips and Darren Pesce, who had played with Porcell in a band called The Young Republicans in the past.

===''Can't Close My Eyes''===
In 1985, Youth Of Today recorded their debut EP ''Can't Close My Eyes'' for [[Kevin Seconds]]' (singer of the popular hardcore band [[7 Seconds (band)|7 Seconds]]) label Positive Force Records with additional lyrics by John L Hancock III (aka Ratboy). At the same time the band contributed five songs to the Connecticut Fun compilation album; these tracks would later be combined with the aforementioned release to make the album version of ''Can't Close My Eyes'' that is commonly recognized today.

After touring for a while both Graham and Darren left the band, and two members of [[New York City|New York]] band Straight Ahead joined Ray and John, [[Craig Setari]] (bass) and [[Tommy Carroll (musician)|Tommy Carroll]] (drums). Tommy left during their second tour, and [[Drew Thomas]], drummer of brother band [[Crippled Youth]] (who later changed their name to [[Bold (band)|Bold]]), was asked to finish the rest of the tour.

===''Break Down The Walls''===
A short while later, Underdog vocalist [[Richie Birkenhead]] joined the band on second guitar. With this line-up, the first Youth Of Today album was recorded, entitled ''Break Down The Walls'', and released by Wishingwell Records, the label of California straight edge bands Unity and [[Uniform Choice]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bandtoband.com/band/youth-of-today/break-down-the-walls|title=Youth Of Today "Break Down The Walls"|website=BandToBand.com}}</ref> Soon after recording the album Drew was replaced by Mike "Judge" (later to be the singer, along with John Porcelly on guitar, in the band [[Judge (band)|Judge]]).
 
Craig left to reform Straight Ahead (and later played in [[Agnostic Front]] and [[Sick Of It All]]), and [[Walter Schreifels]] of [[Gorilla Biscuits]] joined on as the new bassist. At the end of the ''Break Down The Walls'' tour that followed the release of the LP, second guitarist Richie left the band to concentrate on singing in Underdog, and with that line-up Youth Of Today appeared with two songs on the [[Revelation Records]] compilation "New York Hardcore - The Way It Is", alongside [[New York City|New York]] bands like [[Bold (band)|Bold]], Gorilla Biscuits, Side By Side and [[Sick of it All]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bandtoband.com/band/youth-of-today/new-york-city-hardcore-the-way-it-is|title=Youth Of Today "New York City Hardcore · The Way It Is" compilation|website=BandToBand.com}}</ref>

===''We're Not In This Alone''===
At the end of 1987, Mike left the band, and [[Sammy Siegler]] became the new drummer. In 1988, Youth Of Today recorded their classic second LP "[[We're Not In This Alone]]", which was released in America by [[Caroline Records (U.S.)|Caroline Records]] and in [[Europe]] by both We Bite Records and Funhouse Records. The beginning of the next year, Youth Of Today, whose line-up was steady at last, did a [[Europe]]an tour- playing shows in: [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[England]]. In 1990, Youth Of Today decided to quit and recorded 4 songs for a farewell 7" on Revelation Records. Three of those songs appeared on the single "Disengage".

When Youth Of Today split, it seemed the beginning of the end for the second straight edge wave, which had begun in 1985, and which was at its height in 1988–1990. Together with bands like [[Uniform Choice]], [[Gorilla Biscuits]], No For An Answer, and [[Chain of Strength]], Youth Of Today were an inspiration for hundreds of bands all over the world, who combined the message of positive thinking and straight edge with energetic and fast hardcore, as well as an inspiration for hundreds of thousands of kids to live and lead a positive drug-free life.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Post-breakup===
Ray Cappo of Youth of Today started the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] band [[Shelter (band)|Shelter]], and was later joined by Porcell. Walter was playing guitar in Gorilla Biscuits from 1986 until their end, and was joined on the European tour of Gorilla Biscuits in 1990 by Porcell and Sammy on guitar and drums. After the split of Gorilla Biscuits, Walter started [[Quicksand (band)|Quicksand]], and later on, [[Rival Schools (band)|Rival Schools]] and [[Walking Concert]]. Sammy later played drums in [[CIV (band)|CIV]] (which featured members of Gorilla Biscuits) and multiple other bands.

=== Reunion ===
Aside from several one-off reunion shows, Youth of Today did a European reunion tour in 2003 with original members Ray, Porcell and Sammy. Ray's friend Ken Olden from [[Battery (hardcore punk band)|Battery]] and [[Better Than A Thousand]] filled in on bass. In fall 2010, they again started for a small reunion tour through Europe starting on September 16, in Lyss, Switzerland. A first-ever South American tour was scheduled for the first week of December 2010, taking Youth Of Today to countries like Peru, Chile, Argentina and Brazil.

They played two shows in Russia, and two in Oslo, Norway during the 3rd week in March 2011 Youth of Today played the U Street Music Hall in [[Washington, D.C.]] on June 3, 2011. Opening bands were [[Mouthpiece (band)|Mouthpiece]] and Give. They played a show at the Glasshouse in [[Pomona, California]], and another show at the Chaos in Tejas festival in June 2011. They played at the Getaway Rock Festival in Gävle, Sweden on 7–9 July 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.getawayrock.se/festival/|title=Getaway Rock Festival 2011 - Gävle / Gasklockorna|date=March 22, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322072209/http://www.getawayrock.se/festival/|archive-date=2011-03-22}}</ref> Youth of Today played at New Direction Fest #2 in Olbia - Sardinia 10 July 2011.
