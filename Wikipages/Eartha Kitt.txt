'''Eartha Kitt''' (born '''Eartha Mae Keith'''; January 17, 1927&nbsp;– December 25, 2008) was an American singer, actress, comedienne, dancer, and activist known for her highly distinctive singing style and her 1953 recordings of "[[C'est si bon]]" and the Christmas [[novelty song]] "[[Santa Baby]]". [[Orson Welles]] once called her the "most exciting woman in the world".<ref>{{cite news | last=Messer|first= Kate X. | title=Just An Old Fashioned Cat | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/arts/2006-07-21/388422/ | work=The Austin Chronicle | date=July 21, 2006}}</ref>

Kitt began her career in 1942 and appeared in the 1945 original [[Broadway theatre]] production of the musical ''Carib Song''. In the early 1950s, she had six US Top 30 entries, including "[[Uska Dara]]" and "[[I Want to Be Evil]]". Her other recordings include the UK Top 10 song "[[Under the Bridges of Paris]]" (1954), "[[Just an Old Fashioned Girl]]" (1956) and "[[Where Is My Man]]" (1983). She starred as [[Catwoman]] in the third and final season of the television series ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' in 1967.

In 1968, her career in the U.S. deteriorated after she made [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War]] statements at a [[White House]] luncheon. Ten years later, Kitt made a successful return to Broadway in the 1978 original production of the musical ''[[Timbuktu!]]'', for which she received the first of her two [[Tony Award]] nominations. Her second was for the 2000 original production of the musical ''[[The Wild Party (LaChiusa musical)|The Wild Party]]''. Kitt wrote three autobiographies.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kitt|first=Eartha|title=I'm Still Here|year=1990|publisher=Pan|isbn=0-330-31439-4|location=London|oclc=24719847}}</ref>

Kitt found a new generation of fans through her roles in the Disney films ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'' (2000), in which she voiced the villainous [[Yzma]], and ''[[Holes (film)|Holes]]'' (2003). She reprised the role as Yzma in the direct-to-video sequel ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]'' (2005), as well as the animated series ''[[The Emperor's New School]]'' (2006–2008). Her work on the latter earned her two [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program|Daytime Emmy Award]]s. She posthumously won a third Emmy in 2010 for her guest performance on ''[[Wonder Pets!]]''.

==Early life==
Eartha Mae Keith was born on a cotton [[plantation]] near the small town of [[North, South Carolina]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/dec/26/eartha-kitt-obituary |title=Obituary: Eartha Kitt|first= Adrian |last=Jack|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=December 17, 2008|access-date= June 17, 2018}}</ref> or [[St. Matthews, South Carolina|St. Matthews]]<ref>{{YouTube|qYQWqLV35J8|Eartha Kitt: My Family (interview)}}</ref> on January 17, 1927.

==Career==
[[File:Eartha Kitt (1952).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Kitt photographed by [[Carl Van Vechten]], October 19, 1952]]
Kitt began her career as a member of the [[Katherine Dunham Company]] in 1943 and remained a member of the troupe until 1948. A talented singer with a distinctive voice, she recorded the hits "[[Let's Do It, Let's Fall in Love|Let's Do It]]", "Champagne Taste", "[[C'est si bon]]" (which [[Stan Freberg]] famously burlesqued), "[[Just an Old Fashioned Girl]]", "[[Monotonous (song)|Monotonous]]", "Je cherche un homme", "[[Love for Sale (song)|Love for Sale]]", "I'd Rather Be Burned as a Witch", "[[Kâtibim]]" (a Turkish melody), "Mink, Schmink", "[[Under the Bridges of Paris]]" and her most recognizable hit "[[Santa Baby]]", which was released in 1953. Kitt's unique style was enhanced as she became fluent in French during her years performing in Europe. She spoke four languages (she is thought to have learned German and Dutch from her stepfather, English from her mother, and French from the European cabaret circuit){{Request quotation|date=March 2018}} and sang in eleven, which she demonstrated in many of the live recordings of her cabaret performances. [[Diana Ross]] said that as a member of [[The Supremes]] she largely based her look and sound after Kitt's.<ref name="seducer">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/26/arts/26kitt.html|title=Eartha Kitt, a Seducer of Audiences, Dies at 81|first=Rob|last=Hoerburger|date=December 25, 2008|work=New York Times}}</ref>

===Career peaks===
[[File:Eartha Kit (1962).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Kitt asleep on a bus, 1962]]
In 1950, [[Orson Welles]] gave Kitt her first starring role as [[Helen of Troy]] in his staging of ''[[The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus|Dr. Faustus]]''. Two years later, she was cast in the revue ''[[New Faces of 1952]]'', introducing "[[Monotonous (song)|Monotonous]]" and "Bal, Petit Bal", two songs with which she is still identified. In 1954, [[20th Century Fox]] distributed an independently filmed version of the revue entitled ''New Faces'', in which she performed "Monotonous", "[[Uska Dara]]", "[[C'est si bon]]",<ref>{{cite news|last=Hall|first=Phil|title=New Faces|publisher=Film Threat|date=January 4, 2001|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=reviews&Id=1490}}</ref> and "[[Santa Baby]]". Though it is often alleged that Welles and Kitt had an affair during her 1957 run in ''[[Shinbone Alley]]'', Kitt categorically denied this in a June 2001 interview with [[George Wayne]] of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''. "I never had sex with Orson Welles," Kitt told ''Vanity Fair'': "It was a working situation and nothing else."<ref>{{cite news | last=Wayne | first=George | title=Back to Eartha | url=http://earthakitt.com/press/vanities.jpg | work=Vanity Fair | date=June 2001 |page=160}}</ref> Her other films in the 1950s included ''[[The Mark of the Hawk]]'' (1957), ''[[St. Louis Blues (1958 film)|St. Louis Blues]]'' (1958) and ''[[Anna Lucasta (1958 film)|Anna Lucasta]]'' (1958). Kitt had a minor hit in Sweden 1956 with her record in Swedish, "Rosenkyssar" ("Rose Kisses", RCA FAS 511).{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

[[File:Eartha Kitt Catwoman Batman 1967.JPG|thumb|upright|Kitt as [[Catwoman]] in the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series, 1967]]
Throughout the rest of the 1950s and early 1960s, she recorded; worked in film, television, and nightclubs; and returned to the Broadway stage, in ''Mrs. Patterson'' (during the 1954–1955 season), ''Shinbone Alley'' (in 1957), and the short-lived ''Jolly's Progress'' (in 1959).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ibdb.com/person.php?id=48248 |title=Eartha Kitt |publisher=Internet Broadway Database |access-date=May 14, 2013}}</ref> In 1964, Kitt helped open the [[Circle Star Theater]] in [[San Carlos, California]]. In the late 1960s, ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' featured Kitt as [[Catwoman]] after [[Julie Newmar]] had left the show in 1967. She appeared in a 1967 ''[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]'' episode "The Traitor," as a contortionist.

In 1956 she published an autobiography called 'Thursday's Child', which would later serve as inspiration for the name of the 1999 [[David Bowie]] song [[Thursday's Child (David Bowie song)|Thursday's Child]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/thursdayschild00kitt|title=Thursday's child|first=Eartha|last=Kitt|date=November 25, 1956|publisher=New York, Duell, Sloan and Pearce|via=Internet Archive}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/david-bowie-stardust-unofficial/|title=Does David Bowie Biopic ‘Stardust’ Benefit From Being Unofficial?|first=Martin|last=Kielty|website=Ultimate Classic Rock}}</ref>

===The "White House Incident"===
In January 1968,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://timeline.com/eartha-kitt-white-house-89411992a367 |title=The black actress who made Lady Bird Johnson cry; The truth hurts|first=Stephanie|last= Buck|date= March 13, 2017|website= timeline.com}}</ref> during [[Lyndon B.

She replied: "You send the best of this country off to be shot and maimed. No wonder the kids rebel and take [[Cannabis (drug)|pot]]."<ref name="seducer"/>
During a question-and-answer session, Kitt stated:
{{Blockquote|quote=The children of America are not rebelling for no reason. They are not [[hippie]]s for no reason at all. We don't have what we have on [[Sunset Boulevard|Sunset Blvd.]] for no reason. They are rebelling against something. There are so many things burning the people of this country, particularly mothers. They feel they are going to raise sons&nbsp;– and I know what it's like, and you have children of your own, Mrs. Johnson&nbsp;– we raise children and send them to war.}}
Her remarks caused Mrs. Johnson to burst into tears.<ref name=indiancountry /> It is widely believed that Kitt's career in the United States was ended following her comments about the Vietnam War, after which she was branded "a sadistic [[nymphomaniac]]" by the [[CIA]].<ref name=Luck /> A defamatory CIA dossier about Kitt was discovered by [[Seymour Hersh]] in 1975. Hersh published an article about the dossier in ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref name=Hersh>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/03/archives/cia-in-68-gave-secret-service-a-report-containing-gossip-about.html|title=CIA gave Secret Service a Report containing Gossip about Eartha Kitt after a White House Incident|first=Seymour|last= Hersh|author-link=Seymour Hersh|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 3, 1975}}</ref> The dossier contained comments about Kitt's sex life and family history, along with negative opinions of her that were held by former colleagues. Kitt's response to the dossier was to say: "I don't understand what this is about. I think it's disgusting."<ref name=Hersh /> Following the incident, Kitt devoted her energies to performances in Europe and Asia.

===Broadway===
In the 1970s, Kitt appeared on television several times on [[BBC]]'s long-running variety show ''[[The Good Old Days (UK TV series)|The Good Old Days]]'', and in 1987 took over from fellow American [[Dolores Gray]] in the London [[West End theatre|West End]] production of Stephen Sondheim's ''[[Follies]]'' and returned at the end of that run to star in a one-woman-show at the same [[Shaftesbury Theatre]], both to tremendous acclaim. In both those shows performing the show-stopping theatrical anthem "[[I'm Still Here (Follies song)|I'm Still Here]]". Kitt returned to New York City in a triumphant turn in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] spectacle ''[[Timbuktu!]]'' (a version of the perennial ''[[Kismet (musical)|Kismet]]'', set in Africa) in 1978. In the musical, one song gives a "recipe" for ''mahoun'', a preparation of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], in which her sultry purring rendition of the refrain "constantly stirring with a long wooden spoon" was distinctive. She was nominated for the [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical]] for her performance. In the late 1990s, she appeared as the [[Wicked Witch of the West]] in the North American national touring company of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1987 musical)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. In 2000, Kitt again returned to Broadway in the short-lived run of [[Michael John LaChiusa]]'s ''[[The Wild Party (LaChiusa musical)|The Wild Party]]''. Beginning in late 2000, Kitt starred as the [[Fairy Godmother]] in the U.S. national tour of ''[[Cinderella (Rodgers and Hammerstein musical)|Cinderella]]''. In 2003, she replaced [[Chita Rivera]] in ''[[Nine (musical)|Nine]]''. Kitt reprised her role as the Fairy Godmother at a special engagement of ''Cinderella'', which took place at [[Lincoln Center]] during the holiday season of 2004. From October to early December 2006, Kitt co-starred in the [[off-Broadway]] musical ''[[Mimi le Duck]]''.

===Voice-over===
In 1978, Kitt did the voice-over in a television commercial for the album ''[[Aja (album)|Aja]]'' by the rock group [[Steely Dan]]. One of her more unusual roles was as [[Kaa]] in a 1994 [[BBC Radio]] adaptation of ''[[The Jungle Book]]''. In 1998, she voiced Bagheera in the live-action direct-to-video Disney film ''[[The Jungle Book: Mowgli's Story]]''. Kitt also lent her distinctive voice to [[Yzma]] in ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'' (for which she won her first [[Annie Award]]) and reprised her role in ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]'' and ''[[The Emperor's New School]]'', for which she won two [[Emmy Award]]s and, in 2007&ndash;08, two more [[Annie Awards]] for Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production. She also voiced the villain Vexus in the [[Nickelodeon]] series ''[[My Life as a Teenage Robot]]''.

===Later years===

In 1984, she returned to the music charts with a disco song titled "[[Where Is My Man]]", the first certified gold record of her career. "Where Is My Man" reached the [[Top 40]] on the [[UK Singles Chart]], where it peaked at No.&nbsp;36;<ref>{{cite web | title=Where Is My Man | url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/Breakin%27%20Down%20%28Sugar%20Samba%29 | url-status=dead | publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] | access-date=September 12, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711041844/http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/breakin'%20down%20(sugar%20samba)/ | archive-date=July 11, 2017 }}</ref> the song became a standard in discos and dance clubs of the time and made the Top 10 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Dance Club Play|dance chart]], where it reached No.&nbsp;7.<ref>[[Joel Whitburn|Whitburn, Joel]] (2004). ''Hot Dance/Disco 1974–2003''. Record Research Inc.</ref> The single was followed by the album ''I Love Men'' on the Record Shack label. Kitt found new audiences in nightclubs across the UK and the United States, including a whole new generation of gay male fans, and she responded by frequently giving benefit performances in support of [[HIV/AIDS]] organizations. Her 1989 follow-up hit "Cha-Cha Heels" (featuring [[Bronski Beat]]), which was originally intended to be recorded by [[Divine (performer)|Divine]], received a positive response from UK dance clubs, reaching No.&nbsp;32 in the charts in that country. In 1988, Kitt replaced [[Dolores Gray]] in the West End production of [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s ''[[Follies]]'' as Carlotta, receiving standing ovations every night for her rendition of "[[I'm Still Here (Follies song)|I'm Still Here]]" at the beginning of act 2. She went on to perform her own one-woman show at The [[Shaftesbury Theatre]] to sold-out houses for three weeks in early 1989 after ''Follies''.

====1990s====
Kitt appeared with Jimmy James and [[George Burns]] at a fundraiser in 1990 produced by Scott Sherman, agent from the Atlantic Entertainment Group. It was arranged that James would impersonate Kitt and then Kitt would walk out to take the microphone. This was met with a standing ovation.<ref name=Baltimore>Scott Duncan, [http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1990-09-17/features/1990260107_1_eartha-kitt-lifesongs-george-burns "George Burns, Eartha Kitt are delightful at 'Lifesongs 1990'"], ''The Baltimore Sun'', September 17, 1990.</ref> In 1991, Kitt returned to the screen in ''[[Ernest Scared Stupid]]'' as Old Lady Hackmore. In 1992, she had a supporting role as Lady Eloise in ''[[Boomerang (1992 film)|Boomerang]]''. In 1995, Kitt appeared as herself in an episode of ''[[The Nanny]]'', where she performed a song in French and flirted with Maxwell Sheffield ([[Charles Shaughnessy]]). In November 1996, she appeared in an episode of ''[[Celebrity Jeopardy|Celebrity Jeopardy!]]''.  She also did a series of commercials for [[Old Navy]].

====2000s====
In 2000, Eartha Kitt won an [[Annie Award]] for her starring voice role as "[[Yzma]]" in the Disney feature film ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'', later reprising the role in 2005 in Disney's ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]''.  Kitt returned once again to the silver screen in 2003 with the charming role of Madame Zeroni in the film ''[[Holes (film)|Holes]]'' based on the book by the same name, by author [[Louis Sachar]]. In August 2007, Kitt was the spokesperson for [[MAC Cosmetics]]' Smoke Signals collection. She re-recorded "[[Smoke Gets in Your Eyes]]" for the occasion, was showcased on the MAC website, and the song was played at all MAC locations carrying the collection for the month. She also appeared in the 2007 independent film ''[[And Then Came Love]]'' opposite [[Vanessa Williams]]. In her later years, Kitt made annual appearances in the New York Manhattan [[cabaret]] scene at venues such as the Ballroom and the [[Cafe Carlyle|Café Carlyle]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/26/arts/26kitt.html?_r=0 |newspaper=The New York Times |title=Eartha Kitt Obituary |access-date=October 30, 2014|date=December 25, 2008 |last1=Hoerburger |first1=Rob }}</ref>  As noted, Kitt did voice work for the animated projects ''The Emperor's New Groove'' and its spinoffs, as well as for ''[[My Life as a Teenage Robot]]''.

==Activism==
Kitt was active in numerous social causes in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1966, she established the Kittsville Youth Foundation, a chartered and non-profit organization for underprivileged youths in the [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] area of Los Angeles.<ref>Johnson, Robert E. (June 14, 1973). "Eartha Kitt Observes Seventh Year With Black Ghetto School". ''Jet'' '''44''': 56.</ref> She was also involved with a group of youths in the area of [[Anacostia]] in Washington, D.C., who called themselves "Rebels with a Cause". Kitt supported the groups' efforts to clean up streets and establish recreation areas in an effort to keep them out of trouble by testifying with them before the House General Subcommittee on Education of the [[Committee on Education and Labor]]. In her testimony, in May 1967, Kitt stated that the Rebels' "achievements and accomplishments should certainly make the adult 'do-gooders' realize that these young men and women have performed in 1 short year – with limited finances – that which was not achieved by the same people who might object to turning over some of the duties of planning, rehabilitation, and prevention of juvenile delinquents and juvenile delinquency to those who understand it and are living it".

After ''[[The New York Times]]'' discovered the CIA file on Kitt in 1975, she granted the paper permission to print portions of the report, stating: "I have nothing to be afraid of and I have nothing to hide."<ref name=Hersh />

Kitt later became a vocal advocate for [[LGBT rights]] and publicly supported [[same-sex marriage]], which she considered a [[civil right]]. She had been quoted as saying: "I support it [gay marriage] because we're asking for the same thing. If I have a partner and something happens to me, I want that partner to enjoy the benefits of what we have reaped together. It's a civil-rights thing, isn't it?"<ref>{{cite news | title=Eartha Kitt, actress and gay rights ally, dies at age 81 | url=http://pageoneq.com/news/2008/Eartha_Kitt_actress_and_gay_rights_ally_dies_at__1229.html | publisher=PageOneQ | date=December 28, 2008 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430160502/http://pageoneq.com/news/2008/Eartha_Kitt_actress_and_gay_rights_ally_dies_at__1229.html | archive-date=April 30, 2009 }}</ref> Kitt famously appeared at many LGBT fundraisers, including a mega event in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], with [[George Burns]] and [[Jimmy James (performance artist)|Jimmy James]].<ref name=Baltimore /> Scott Sherman, an agent at [[Atlantic Entertainment Group]], stated: "Eartha Kitt is fantastic... appears at so many LGBT events in support of civil rights." In a 1992 interview with Dr. [[Anthony Clare]], Kitt spoke about her gay following, saying:
{{Blockquote|quote=We're all rejected people, we know what it is to be refused, we know what it is to be oppressed, depressed, and then, accused, and I am very much cognizant of that feeling. Nothing in the world is more painful than rejection. I am a rejected, oppressed person, and so I understand them, as best as I can, even though I am a heterosexual.<ref>{{YouTube|ciHv4qUH1Ok|Eartha Kitt sings Swedish and talks about her gay-fans}}</ref>}}

Kitt died of [[colon cancer]] on Christmas Day 2008, three weeks short of her 82nd birthday at her home in [[Westport, Connecticut]].<ref name="death-ap">{{cite news | url=http://www.today.com/id/28386832/ns/today-entertainment/t/singer-actress-eartha-kitt-dies/ | title=Singer-actress Eartha Kitt dies at 81 | publisher=MSNBC | date=December 26, 2008 }}</ref><ref name="death">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/assets/print?aid=USTRE4BO1H520081226|title=Seductive singer Eartha Kitt dies at 81|date=December 26, 2008|work=Reuters|first=Christopher|last=Wilson}}</ref> Her daughter, Kitt McDonald, described her last days with her mother:

{{blockquote|I was with her when she died. She left this world literally screaming at the top of her lungs. I was with her constantly, she lived not even 3 miles from my house, we were together practically every day. She was home for the last few weeks when the doctor told us there was nothing they could do any more. Up until the last two days, she was still moving around. The doctor told us she will leave very quickly and her body will just start to shut down. But when she left, she left the world with a bang, she left it how she lived it. She screamed her way out of here, literally. I truly believe her survival instincts were so part of her DNA that she was not going to go quietly or willingly. It was just the two of us hanging out [during the last days] she was very funny. We didn't have to [talk] because I always knew how she felt about me. I was the love of her life, so the last part of her life we didn't have to have these heart to heart talks. She started to see people that weren't there. She thought I could see them too, but, of course, I couldn't. I would make fun of her like, "I'm going to go in the other room and you stay here and talk to your friends."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mommynoire.com/44327/kitt-shapiro-daughter-eartha-kitt-offers-business-advice-moms-talks-mothers-passing/2/#sthash.WTw50Hne.dpuf|title=Kitt Shapiro (Daughter of Eartha Kitt) Offers Business Advice for Moms & Discusses Mother’s Passing & Legacy|author=Ms. Lee Brown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622003001/http://mommynoire.com/44327/kitt-shapiro-daughter-eartha-kitt-offers-business-advice-moms-talks-mothers-passing/2/#sthash.WTw50Hne.dpuf |archive-date=June 22, 2015|website=Mommynoire.com|date=October 5, 2013}}</ref>}}
