== Early life and education ==
Whitmore grew up on a 160-acre horse farm in [[Lee County, Iowa|Lee County]], Iowa, not far outside of [[Keokuk, Iowa|Keokuk]], Iowa. His parents, Elyse Whitmore (née Tweedy) and Harold Whitmore,<ref name=PamDixon-WealthyElliott-FamilyTree>{{cite web|title=Genealogy Report: Descendants of Wealthy Elliott|url=http://www.genealogy.com/ftm/d/i/x/Pam-Dixon/GENE1-0022.html|website=Pam-Dixon Family Tree|access-date=April 25, 2018}}</ref> were farmers, and the farm had been in his family since his third great grandfather, who was an immigrant from Ireland.<ref name=Pitch-FieldSongs-2012>{{cite news|last1=Parker|first1=Chris|title=William Elliott Whitmore vs. the modern world|url=https://www.pitch.com/arts-entertainment/music/article/20571169/william-elliott-whitmore-vs-the-modern-world|work=[[The Pitch (newspaper)|Kansas City Pitch]]|date=February 7, 2012}}</ref> After his parents died, he converted the farm to row crops, which he leases to a neighboring farmer so he can be on the road to perform. He has an older brother and sister.<ref name=Westword-AnimalsInTheDark-2009>{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=Michael|title=Q&A with William Elliott Whitmore|url=http://www.westword.com/music/qanda-with-william-elliott-whitmore-5693287|work=[[Westword]]|date=January 22, 2009}}</ref>

While he was growing up, the family was musical, with his dad playing the guitar, his mother playing the accordion and piano, and both his paternal and maternal grandfathers playing the banjo.<ref name=DailyIowan-2017>{{cite news|last1=Wright|first1=Levi|title=Music for folks from the heart of Iowa|url=http://daily-iowan.com/2017/02/02/music-for-folks-from-the-heart-of-iowa/|work=[[The Daily Iowan]]|date=February 2, 2017}}</ref> [[Charley Pride]] and [[Willie Nelson]] were huge influences growing up. Whitmore sang from his earliest years, but when he was a teenager he began playing guitar, then eventually the banjo.<ref name=Westword-AnimalsInTheDark-2009 />

In addition to playing locally with a cousin, Whitmore, after a short stint in San Francisco, moved to [[Iowa City]] and got involved in the punk rock and the [[DIY ethic|DIY scene]], forming a band called Lost Cause.<ref name=Westword-AnimalsInTheDark-2009 />

In 1996, Whitmore graduated from [[Central Lee High School]] in [[Donnellson, Iowa|Donnellson]], Iowa.<ref name=DailyGateCity-PrairieYieldsPlow-2001>{{cite news|last1=Lamm|first1=Tracey|title=Love of the land and music inspires Whitmore|url=http://www.mississippivalleypublishing.com/love-of-the-land-and-music-inspires-whitmore/article_ff536974-2a1d-5590-bf8e-729c8306e777.html|work=Daily Gate City|date=April 12, 2001}}</ref>

== Career ==
When he was first starting out, Whitmore was a roadie for an [[Iowa City]] punk band called Ten Grand, but he eventually started performing as an opener for the band and toured extensively with Ten Grand.<ref name=LittleVillage-TenGrand-2013>{{cite journal|last1=Spengler|first1=Brendan L.|title=Ten years after the band's sudden end, a history of Iowa City hardcore legends Ten Grand|journal=Little Village|date=September 4, 2013|url=http://littlevillagemag.com/ten-years-after-the-bands-sudden-end-a-history-of-iowa-city-hardcore-legends-ten-grand/}}</ref> This led to him getting signed to the Chicago-based office of [[Southern Records]].<ref name=Westword-AnimalsInTheDark-2009 /> Whitmore said he turned to songwriting as a way to deal with the deaths of his parents, who died within a few years of each other, and the deaths of his grandparents.<ref name=OnMilwaukee-HalwaysAlways-SongBlackbird-2007>{{cite news|last1=Bullock|first1=Dan|title=The smoke-stained howl of William Elliott Whitmore|url=https://staff.onmilwaukee.com/music/articles/willwhitmore.html?viewall=1|work=[[OnMilwaukee]]|date=March 26, 2007}}</ref>

Whitmore built a long-term relationship with [[Southern Records]], releasing three records on the label. The three records on Southern, 2003's ''Hymns for the Hopeless,'' 2005's ''Ashes to Dust,'' and 2006's ''Song of the Blackbird,'' were a trilogy that were focused on death and his experience processing the deaths of those close to him.<ref name=SittingIn-AnimalsInTheDark-2009>{{cite news|last1=Tramontana|first1=Gianluca|last2=Whitmore|first2=William Elliott|title=William Elliott Whitmore|url=http://www.sittingwith.com/fileadmin/archive/Sitting_With_William_E_Whitmore.mp3|work=Sitting with Gianluca: From Country-Bluegrass-Blues to CBGBs|year=2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426014256/http://www.sittingwith.com/fileadmin/archive/Sitting_With_William_E_Whitmore.mp3|archive-date=April 26, 2013|format=Audio interview}}</ref> He recorded the records with Mike Lust at Phantom Manor in Chicago.<ref name=OnMilwaukee-HalwaysAlways-SongBlackbird-2007 />

It reached Number 50 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Heatseekers [[record chart|chart]].

The song, "Civilizations" off his 2015 record, ''Radium Death,'' is about how an [[Dakota Access Pipeline|oil pipeline]] running from South Dakota to Illinois was going to go through his grandmother's property on their farm.<ref name=StLouisMag-RadiumDeath-2016>{{cite news|last1=Maurice|first1=Raphael|title=William Elliott Whitmore: Gospel Music For Atheists|url=https://www.stlmag.com/culture/music/william-elliott-whitmore-gospel-music-for-atheists/|work=[[St. Louis Magazine]]|date=August 31, 2016}}</ref>
