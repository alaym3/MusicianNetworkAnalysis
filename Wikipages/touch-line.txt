{{Short description|Aspect of sports}}
The '''touch-line''' is the line on either side of the playing area of a games of [[rugby league]], [[rugby union]] and [[association football]]. In many other sports it is called a [[sidelines|side-line]].

The continuation of the touch-line beyond the [[goal (sport)|goal line]] ending at the [[dead ball line]] is called the "touch-in-goal line". In rugby union the two touch-lines may not be more than {{convert|70|m|ft}} apart and they are not part of the playing area (Law 1).

* The area beyond the touch-line is [[touch (rugby)|touch]].
* The officials who monitor the touch-lines are the [[touch judge]]s.
