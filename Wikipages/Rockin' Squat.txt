During his career he collaborated in music with artists like [[KRS-One]], [[Seu Jorge]], [[Tony Allen (musician)|Tony Allen]], [[Supernatural (rapper)|Supernatural]], [[Olodum]], [[Ol Dirty Bastard]], [[Cheick Tidiane Seck]], [[El-P]], [[RZA]], [[Agallah]], [[R.A. the Rugged Man]], [[Immortal Technique]], Ivor Lancellotti, [[Oxmo Puccino]], [[Mr. Catra]] or [[Wise Intelligent]].

He also collaborated with directors like [[Jean-François Richet]], [[Olivier Megaton]], [[Mathieu Kassovitz]], [[Jan Kounen]], Rabah Ameur-Zaïmeche among others.

== Early life ==
Mathias Cassel was born on September 7, 1970 in [[Paris]]. He is the son of actor [[Jean-Pierre Cassel]] and Sabine Cassel-Lanfranchi, former editor-in-chief of the gastronomic pages of American [[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]. He comes from a family of artists: his brother is actor [[Vincent Cassel]] and his half-sister actress [[Cécile Cassel]], also known as [[HollySiz]] as a singer. During his childhood, Mathias Cassel grew up in the [[United States]], bathed in [[hip-hop]] culture, he began rap at the age of 11. Before his career as a rapper, he was a “tagger” known on the Parisian scene under the name of Squat and wrote texts at the same time.

In 1985, he founded [[Assassin (rap crew)|Assassin]] with Solo. Assassin is one of the first groups to bring hip-hop to [[France]], with “conscious” lyrics, delivering a political and social message. Like [[Suprême NTM|NTM]] or [[IAM (band)|IAM]], this group, considered to be a pioneer, has marked the history of [[French rap]]. It is also the first rap group to give a concert at the [[Olympia (Paris)|Olympia]] in 1993 and to have set up its own label, independent of the majors.

From 1991 to 2004, the records of the group [[Assassin (rap crew)|Assassin]] were self-produced and came out under the label Assassin Productions, the first independent label of French rap. From 2005, the albums were reissued under the new independent label, Livin' Astro, created in 2004 by Rockin' Squat, and under which, since, his solo albums have been released, each of them certified gold disc always meets a large audience, independently and without media support.

== Career ==
In the mid-80s, he created the famous [[Rap music|rap]] group [[Assassin (rap crew)|Assassin]], becoming the first artist of this scene to mention [[politics]] and [[social problems]] in his records. The subjects of his rap songs include modern [[slavery]] ("Esclave 2000"), [[ecology]] ("Sauvons la planète"), [[political prisoner]]s ("Écrire contre l'oubli"), [[women's rights]] ("L'objet" and "L'Entrave a nos jouissances"), [[racism]] ("Peur d'une race"), the [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|NWO]] ("Démocratie fasciste : Article 1, 2, 3 and 4", "Illuminazi 666") or [[Colonization of Africa|African colonisation]] ("France à fric").
He has collaborated with artists such as [[KRS-One]], [[Supernatural (rapper)|Supernatural]], [[Olodum]], [[Immortal Technique]], [[Cheick Tidiane Seck]], [[El-P]], [[RZA (musician)|RZA]], [[Agallah]] The Don Bishop, [[RA the Rugged Man]] or [[Wise Intelligent]].
His triple album, "Confessions d'un enfant du siècle", has been released between 2008 and 2010.

==Collaborations==

In April 2009, a new song leaked on the internet named Democratie Fasciste (Article 4) which featured [[Immortal Technique]]. The official release of the song and Rockin Squat's album "Confessions D'un Enfant Du Siècle Volume 2" was on May 12, 2009. The beat from the song was sampled from [[Wu-Tang Clan]]'s song "Tearz". The song expresses the inequalities of the [[Third World]] and revolutionary events throughout history against tyranny and oppression. The song contains lyrics in English (Immortal Technique), French (Rockin' Squat) and brief shout outs in Spanish (Immortal Technique).<ref name="Rockin Squat Ft.
