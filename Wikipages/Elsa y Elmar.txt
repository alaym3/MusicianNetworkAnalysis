'''Elsa y Elmar''' is the name of the musical project of Elsa Carvajal, a singer-songwriter from Colombia. Describing her songs as "spiritual pop", in 2014 she won the Grand Prize in the Latin category of the [[John Lennon Songwriting Contest]] for her song "Me Viene Bien", and in 2016 she played in front of 40,000 people as the opening act for [[Coldplay]] at their concert at the [[Estadio El Campín]] in [[Bogotá]].

== History ==
Born in [[Bucaramanga]] in Colombia, Carvajal took some classes in musical appreciation and flute at the age of nine, but admitted that she had little discipline to continue with them. At the age of 16, she enrolled in a jazz academy, and then in 2011, she traveled to [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] in order to study at the [[Berklee College of Music]].<ref name="EFE">{{cite web |title=La colombiana Elsa promociona en California su "pop espiritual" |url=https://www.efe.com/efe/usa/cultura/la-colombiana-elsa-promociona-en-california-su-pop-espiritual/50000109-2583971 |language=Spanish |publisher=[[EFE]] |date=April 12, 2015 |accessdate=August 15, 2017}}</ref> Carvajal came up with the concept of Elsa y Elmar in 2012 during her time in Boston. In an interview with Colombia's W Radio, Carvajal explained that she liked the idea of being accompanied rather than being a solo star, and that the people who surrounded her and supported her music were her "sea" – the name "Elmar" is a play on "el mar", meaning "the sea" in Spanish.<ref>{{cite AV media |date=March 28, 2016 |title=Elsa y Elmar abrirá el concierto de Coldplay en Bogotá |medium=radio broadcast |language=Spanish |url=http://www.wradio.com.co/escucha/archivo_de_audio/elsa-y-elmar-abrira-el-concierto-de-coldplay-en-bogota/20160328/oir/3094794.aspx |access-date=August 15, 2017 |time=5:27 |location=Bogota, Colombia |publisher=W Radio}}</ref> In 2013 she recorded a six-track [[extended play|EP]] titled ''Sentirnos Bien'',<ref name="EFE" /> produced by [[San Francisco]]-born Colombian Mateo Lewis, himself a former student of Berklee. The EP was released in digital format on October 13, 2013. One of the tracks from ''Sentirnos Bien'', "Me Viene Bien", was entered into the second session of the 2014 [[John Lennon Songwriting Contest]] for new songwriters and won the Grand Prize in the Latin category.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cantor-Navas |first=Judy |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/6554043/elsa-y-elmar-takes-john-lennon-latin-prize |title=Elsa y Elmar Takes John Lennon Latin Prize |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=May 6, 2017 |access-date=August 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=2014 Grand Prize Winners – Session II |url=http://jlsc.com/winners/2014b/winners.php |publisher=[[John Lennon Songwriting Contest]]}}</ref>
