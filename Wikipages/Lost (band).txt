'''Lost''' is an Italian [[Pop music|pop]] band consisting of musicians from [[Vicenza]] and [[Thiene]], in [[Northern Italy]].

== History ==
Lost officially came together in the middle of 2003, through the friendship of the band's singer Walter Fontana, and the guitarist Roberto Visentin, who were soon joined by the drummer Filippo Spezzapria, bassist Matthew Miller and guitarist Giulio Dalla Stella. A few months after their formation they played their first show at a local festival. In 2006, due to internal disputes, Miller was replaced by the new bassist Luca Donazzan. 

The publication of their demo track ''My (?)'' on [[MySpace]] in 2006 proved to be an unexpected success amongst the [[social network]] users. Following this, Lost signed a contract with Bass Department records and the producers Matteo Franzan and Stefano Florino, in 2006.

In the middle of 2007 the group signed up for the Cornetto Free Music Audition and was chosen by the director of the [[Total Request Live|TRL]] Extra Live Italian Music channel. Thanks to this, and the showing of their [[music video]] ''Oggi'' (Italian for "Today"), Lost was talent-spotted by the record company Carosello, who offered the band a contract in September 2007<ref>[Article on AMG]{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p1028264|pure_url=yes}}</ref>

The single ''Oggi'' was released on 15 November 2007, and the following week entered the Italian singles chart in twenty-seventh place,<ref>As reported in all Italian charts</ref> mainly thanks to the single's promotion on [[MTV (Italian TV channel)|MTV Italy]]. At the end of the year, Lost was nominated as the best Italian "riempipiazza 2007" (Meaning the band which could best fill a town square during their show), beside other Italian and international artists.<ref>[''Per TRL i Lost sono il gruppo riempipiazza 2007]http://www.nextplay.it/1088/per-trl-i-lost-sono-il-gruppo-a-riempipiazza-2007a.html</ref> In the new year, the band released their second single ''Tra pioggia e nuvole'' (''Between rain and clouds'') which was also promoted by Total Request Live (TRL).

On 25 January 2008 their first album ''XD'' was published. The album entered the Italian album chart in twenty-seventh position.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carosellorecords.com/carosello/comunicatistampa.asp?idart=109 |title=Carosello Records – Skunk Anansie, Fitz and the Tantrums, Aloe Blacc, Patty Pravo, Miguel Bosè… |publisher=Carosellorecords.com |accessdate=2011-10-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209205332/http://www.carosellorecords.com/carosello/comunicatistampa.asp?idart=109 |archivedate=2009-02-09 }}</ref> After the release of the album the group embarked on their first Italian tour: ''XD Live Tour 2.0.''

In the middle of 2008, Lost opened two dates of [[Tokio Hotel]]'s Italian tour, in Rome and in [[Modena]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.it/news/news_page.asp?idnews=23693&from=mymtv_news |title=Lost vs Tokio Hotel - Notizie online MTV |publisher=Mtv.it |date=2008-06-24 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}</ref>

In late 2008 Lost's guitarist, Giulio Dalla Stella, left to continue his studies at university and obtain a degree.

In 2009, Lost released a single with [[Joel Madden]] from the pop-punk band [[Good Charlotte]], called "Sulla Mia pelle", meaning On My Skin. It immediately went to number one on TRL and Lost won the Best Band on TRL Italy.
"Sulla mia pelle" is the first single of the new album "Sospeso". The album reached gold status in Italy.
The second single from "Sospeso" is the ballad "Sopra il mondo". The band recently went on to win the Best Italian Act for the MTV Europe Music Awards and were also nominated for Best European Act.

On April 4, 2018 the Lost through their social network accounts officially communicate their return.

As of April 15, 2018, all Lost albums are available on the [[Spotify]] platform.

On April 18, 2018, the Lost communicate their very first date after the reunion. They will perform in the group's hometown, Thiene (VI), on June 21, 2018 in Piazza Chilesotti at 21:35.

On May 29, 2019 (11 years after the release of the single "Standby") the new single "Una canzone buona" was released.

On Dic 12, 2019 was released a new single called "I suoi vent'anni".

==Interaction with fans==
Since their very beginnings the group has had direct contact with its listeners through the [[internet]], with different initiatives to facilitate this contact being used on their official site and their [[MySpace]] page. In February 2008, the group launched an official [[podcast]] in which they publish backstage clips and things relating to the band not concerning live shows.

==Break Up==
Lost in 2011 decided to take a break from the scene. Walter has decided to release a solo album in the meantime, while others are dedicated to another project.

Lost in 2018 decided to come back with new music.
