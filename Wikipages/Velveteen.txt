'''Velveteen''' (or '''velveret''') is a type of [[cloth]] made to imitate [[velvet]]. Normally [[cotton]], the term is sometimes applied to a mixture of [[silk]] and cotton. Some velveteens are a kind of [[fustian]], having a rib of velvet [[pile (textile)|pile]] alternating with a plain depression.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Velveteen|volume=27|page=980}}</ref> This fabric has a pile that is short (never more than 3&nbsp;mm deep) and is closely set. It has a firm hand and a slightly sloping pile. Compared to true velvet, velveteen has greater body, does not drape as easily, and has less sheen.<ref>[http://www.sewingtechnology.net/page39.htm free patterns – Velvet<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223182352/http://www.sewingtechnology.net/page39.htm |date=2011-02-23 }}.</ref><ref>[http://www.fabrics.net/amyvelvet.asp Fabric Properties and Distinctions – Velvet<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref>
