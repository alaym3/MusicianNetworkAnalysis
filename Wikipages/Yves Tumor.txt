'''Sean Bowie''', best known by the recording alias '''Yves Tumor''', is an American [[musician]] and [[record producer|producer]] of [[experimental music]], born in [[Miami, Florida]] and currently based in [[Turin]], Italy.<ref>{{cite web |last=McDermott |first=Patrick D. |url=https://www.thefader.com/2016/10/05/fader-mix-yves-tumor |title=FADER Mix: Yves Tumor |work=[[The Fader]] |date=October 5, 2016 |access-date=October 16, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://yves-tumor.bandcamp.com |title=Bandcamp: Yves Tumor |website=[[Bandcamp]] |access-date=October 16, 2018}}</ref>

==Life and career==
Raised in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], Tumor started making music at age 16 as an outlet away from "dull, conservative surroundings." They taught themself to play drums, bass, guitar, and keyboards. Describing their experience growing up in Tennessee as unpleasant, Yves moved at age 20 to San Diego, and then after college, to Los Angeles. They met [[Mykki Blanco]] in 2012, later touring for two and a half years throughout Europe and Asia.<ref name="Dazed">{{cite web|last=Bulut |first=Selim |url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/32976/1/yves-tumor-serpent-music-album-stream-interview |title=Yves Tumor is making mood music in spiritual solitude |work=[[Dazed]] |date=September 20, 2016 |access-date=October 15, 2018}}</ref>

In the early 2010s, Tumor recorded as Teams, and made music which [[AllMusic]] described as "post-[[chillwave]]". The artist debuted the Yves Tumor project in 2015 with an EP for Berlin's experimental club label Janus, and another one for Blanco's label, Dogfood MG.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ballard |first=Thea |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/yves-tumor-experiencing-the-deposit-of-faith |title=Yves Tumor: Experiencing the Deposit of Faith Album Review |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=September 23, 2017 |access-date=October 16, 2018}}</ref><ref name="AllMusic">{{cite web |last=Simpson |first=Paul |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/yves-tumor-mn0003438593/biography |title=Yves Tumor {{!}} Biography & History |work=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=October 16, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Pearl |first=Max |url=https://www.residentadvisor.net/news/36226 |title=RA News: PAN signs Yves Tumor for debut album, Serpent Music |work=[[Resident Advisor]] |date=September 1, 2016 |access-date=October 16, 2018}}</ref> That same year, the artist released the first album, ''When Man Fails You'' (which would later be re-released by Apothecary Compositions on April 29, 2016).<ref>{{cite web |last=Clare Welsh |first=April |url=http://www.factmag.com/2016/09/01/mykki-blanco-affiliate-yves-tumor-to-release-serpent-music-on-pan |title=Mykki Blanco affiliate Yves Tumor to release Serpent Music on PAN |website=[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]] |date=September 1, 2016 |access-date=October 16, 2018}}</ref><ref name="AC">{{cite web |url=https://apothecarycompositions.bandcamp.com/album/when-man-fails-you |title=When Man Fails You {{!}} Apothecary Compositions |website=[[Bandcamp]] |access-date=October 16, 2018}}</ref>

In September 2016, Tumor signed with PAN Records and released their label debut, ''[[Serpent Music]]''. Yves had worked on the album for three years after moving to [[Leipzig]], Germany. The album was recorded between Miami, Leipzig, Los Angeles and Berlin.<ref name="Dazed"/> In ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''{{'}}s review of the album, critic Andy Beta compared Tumor's musical style to [[James Ferraro]] and [[Dean Blunt]], and noted their use of "unsettling percussive loops and field recordings to create a mood as if lost in a strange urban landscape."<ref>{{cite web |last=Beta |first=Andy |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22472-serpent-music |title=Yves Tumor: Serpent Music Album Review |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=October 6, 2016 |access-date=October 15, 2018}}</ref>

In September 2017, Tumor released a compilation album titled ''Experiencing the Deposit of Faith'' for free. Later that week, it was revealed through a tour announcement that Tumor had signed to [[Warp (record label)|Warp Records]]. Following the announcement, the artist embarked on a tour with a new [[audiovisual]] show.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ryce |first=Andrew |url=https://www.residentadvisor.net/news/40005 |title=RA News: Yves Tumor signs to Warp Records |work=[[Resident Advisor]] |date=September 15, 2017 |access-date=October 16, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Bowe |first=Miles |url=http://www.factmag.com/2017/09/15/yves-tumor-warp-records-album-stream-experiencing-deposit-faith |title=Yves Tumor signs to Warp, releases new album Experiencing The Deposit Of Faith |work=[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]] |date=September 15, 2017 |access-date=October 16, 2018}}</ref>

In September 2018, Tumor released their Warp debut, ''[[Safe in the Hands of Love]]'', with no prior announcement. It was preceded by the singles "Noid" on July 24, "Licking an Orchid" featuring James K on August 29, and "Lifetime" on September 3. The album received universal acclaim from music critics.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/safe-in-the-hands-of-love/yves-tumor |title=Safe in the Hands of Love by Yves Tumor Reviews and Tracks |work=[[Metacritic]] |access-date=October 16, 2018}}</ref> ''Pitchfork''{{'}}s Jayson Greene stated in the review that the album "dwarfs everything the artist has released by several orders of magnitude. The leap is so audacious it's disorienting."<ref>{{cite web |last=Greene |first=Jayson |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/yves-tumor-safe-in-the-hands-of-love |title=Yves Tumor: Safe in the Hands of Love Album Review |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=September 7, 2018 |access-date=October 16, 2018}}</ref>

Tumor's fourth album, ''[[Heaven to a Tortured Mind]]'', was released on April 3, 2020, preceded on March 3 by the single "Kerosene" featuring Diana Gordon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/listen-to-yves-tumor-new-song-kerosene/|title=Listen to Yves Tumor's New Song "Kerosene"|website=Pitchfork|date=March 9, 2020|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref> [[Alexis Petridis]], reviewing the album for ''[[The Guardian]]'', awarded it Album of the Week, describing it as "extraordinary: experimental, capable of any genre, with an internal logic powering its shifts in mood.[…] There’s real skill involved in coming up with something that sounds coherent while shifting through so many styles.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/02/yves-tumor-heaven-to-a-tortured-mind-album-review-warp|work=The Guardian|title=Yves Tumor: Heaven to a Tortured Mind review – strong, wrong songs of a rare genius|first=Alexis|last=Petridis|date=April 2, 2020|access-date=April 3, 2020}}</ref>

In October 2020, Tumor said in an interview with [[Michèle Lamy]] " I have another EP and a whole album basically not finished, but ready to start finishing. I’ve been very busy during the quarantine."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Yves Tumor — Myhtology and Manipulation (Flaunt)|url=https://flaunt.com/content/yves-tumor-manipulation-and-mythology}}</ref> In December 2020, Tumor released the single "let all the poisons that lurk in the mud seep out" in collaboration with [[Kelsey Lu]], featuring Kelly Moran and Moses Boyd.

==Musical style==
Tumor's earlier work was compared to that of [[Dean Blunt]] and [[James Ferraro]], the latter of whom they have collaborated with; however, their more recent music, such as [[Heaven to a Tortured Mind]], has been likened to [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[David Bowie]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22472-serpent-music/|title=Yves Tumor: Serpent Music}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wrbbradio.org/2020/04/13/yves-tumors-attempt-at-rock-on-heaven-to-a-tortured-mind-is-their-most-gratifying-release-yet/|title = Yves Tumor's attempt at rock on 'Heaven to a Tortured Mind' is their most gratifying release yet|date = April 13, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/yves-tumor-heaven-to-a-tortured-mind/|title = Yves Tumor: Heaven to a Tortured Mind}}</ref>
