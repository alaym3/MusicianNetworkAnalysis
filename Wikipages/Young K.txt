In 2010, Kang and his bandmate, Don Lee, were contacted by [[JYP Entertainment]] for an audition and were accepted as trainees. Lee later left JYP to pursue a career in dentistry. Kang went on to appear in the fourth episode of ''WIN: Who is Next?''<ref>{{Cite web|title = Preview of YG vs JYP trainees on 'WIN' revealed {{!}} allkpop.com|url = http://www.allkpop.com/article/2013/09/preview-of-yg-vs-jyp-trainees-on-win-revealed|website = www.allkpop.com|access-date = 2016-01-25}}</ref> as a part of JYP's rapping team with [[Got7]]'s [[Mark Tuan]] and [[Jackson Wang]] against the combined rapping teams of [[Winner (band)|Team A]] and [[iKon (South Korean band)|Team B]], where he became known for the verse, "[[YG Entertainment|YG]], get an attitude!"
