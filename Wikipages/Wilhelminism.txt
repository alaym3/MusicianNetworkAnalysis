The '''Wilhelmine Period''' comprises the period of [[History of Germany|German history]] between 1890 and 1918, embracing the reign of [[Kaiser]] [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] in the [[German Empire]] from the resignation of Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] until the end of [[World War I]] and Wilhelm's abdication during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|November Revolution]]. 
It affected the society, politics, [[Culture of Germany|culture]], art and architecture of Germany and roughly coincided with the [[Belle Époque]] era of Western Europe.

==Characteristics==
The term "'''Wilhelminism'''" is not meant as a conception of society associated with the name Wilhelm, and traceable to an intellectual initiative of the [[German Emperor]]. Rather, it relates to the image presented by Wilhelm II, and his demeanour, manifested by the public presentation of grandiose [[Militarism|military]] parades, and self-aggrandisement on his part, this latter tendency having already been noticed by his grandfather Emperor [[Wilhelm I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]] during the period that Wilhelm's father [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick]] was Crown Prince.

''Wilhelminism'' also characterizes the social and cultural climate of the reign of Wilhelm II, which found expression in rigidly [[Conservatism in Germany|conservative]] attitudes relying on the [[Prussian Junker]] landowners and associated in the [[German Agrarian League]]. Thereby resembling the [[Victorian era]] in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], at the same time, the period was distinguished by an extraordinary belief in [[progress (history)|progress]], which, while contributing to the enormous prosperity of the highly industrialised German Empire, was at odds with its [[social conservatism]]. Though Bismarcks's [[Anti-Socialist Laws]] were not renewed, Wilhelm's government continued to implement measures against [[Socialism|Socialist]] ideas. Nevertheless, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] continued to grow in strength and became the largest faction in the ''[[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]'' (parliament) upon the [[1912 German federal election|1912 elections]]. With stronger influence, the internal developments were characterised by an increasing loyalty of the party establishment towards Emperor and ''[[German Reich|Reich]]''; an attitude that was condemned as "[[Marxist revisionism|revisionism]]" by its opponents and culminated in the ''[[Burgfriedenspolitik|Burgfrieden]]'' policy of granting loans to fund the German effort in World War I.

Foreign policies were founded on Wilhelm's [[Imperialism|imperialist]] ambitions and directed towards the establishment of Germany as a world power (''Weltmacht''); the desire for a "place in the sun" as coined by Secretary of State [[Bernhard von Bülow]] was shared by a large number of German citizens and intellectuals. [[German nationalism]] achieved a short-lived high point, following the acquisition of some [[German colonial empire|colonial possessions]] on the African continent and in the [[South Seas]], while external relations deteriorated: in 1890, Germany had refused to prolong the secret [[Reinsurance Treaty]] with [[Russian Empire|Russia]], concluded by Bismarck in 1887, and had to witness the forming of the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] presenting a new [[two-front war]] scenario. The relations with the British were not only strained by the "[[Scramble for Africa]]" but also by the [[Anglo-German naval arms race]]. Wilhelm's fascination with the [[Imperial German Navy|German Navy]], and his ambition to see it established as an instrument for the projection of world power, were reflected in everyday German life. Even until the middle of the twentieth century, boys were dressed in [[sailor suits]], and in this way were impressed at an early age with the Navy's aura and prestige.

The distinctive spiked helmet, the so-called ''[[Pickelhaube]]'', although it had existed previously, and not only in the German Empire, was symbolic for the Wilhelmine period, for the [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial Army]], and German militarism in general (in various [[sign language]]s, the extended forefinger placed in front of the forehead, indicating the spiked helmet, is still the sign for "German"). The term is equally applied to the distinctive styles prevailing in the visual arts and architecture of the period, for example the ornate ''Germania'' postage stamps,<ref>[http://www.stamp-collecting-world.com/germanempire_germania00.html Germania Issue - 1900]</ref> numerous government buildings as well as the [[Wilhelmine Ring (Berlin)|Wilhelmine Ring]] housing areas of [[Berlin]] and many other German cities. It is also used to describe, among other things, an essentially [[Baroque Revival architecture|Neo-Baroque]], extraordinarily prestige-oriented style of architecture calculated to give expression to the German state's claim to [[Imperialism|imperial]] power. This style was particularly exemplified by the grandiose [[Siegesallee]], a boulevard of sculptures lampooned by Berliners as ''Puppenallee'' ("mall of dolls"), and was given official status by Wilhelm's so-called "''Rinnsteinrede''" ("gutter speech") on what he considered modernist [[degenerate art]] at the inauguration of the extravagant boulevard on December 18, 1901.
