The name 'Alborosie' comes from a name he was given in the early years after moving to Jamaica. "Borosie was what they used to call me. Let me put it like this. My early experience in Jamaica was… not nice. Borosie was a name they used to call me and it has a negative meaning. So I said “I'm gonna use this name and mash up the place turn a negative into a positive thing!". Basically my name is Albert so I add "Al" – Al-borosie. But I’m not gonna tell you what borosie mean!"<ref>{{Cite news|title=Interview : Alborosie |url=http://unitedreggae.com/articles/n117/022808/interview-alborosie |work=[[unitedreggae.com]] |date=28 February 2008}}</ref>
