'''Urban Zakapa''' ({{korean|어반자카파||Eobanjakapa}}) is a South Korean [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] singer-songwriter group formed in 2009 by [[Fluxus Music]]. Originally a 9-member group, in 2012 they became a trio, consisting of Park Yong-in, Jo Hyunah and Kwon Soon-il. The group's name is an abbreviation for '''Urban''', '''Za'''ppy, '''Ka'''leidoscopic, and '''Pa'''ssionate.<ref>{{cite web |title=Urban Zakapa |url=http://kssw.co.kr/wp/?p=5473 |website=Korea Singer-song Writer Association |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031805/http://kssw.co.kr/wp/?p=5473 |archive-date=4 March 2016}}</ref>

==Background==
In 2004, Park Yong-in met Jo Hyun-a at practical music academy. He asked her to form a singing duo. At first Jo Hyun-a's parents opposed that idea, but Hyun-a showed passion to music and was awarded 'MBC 별밤뽐내기'. Eventually, Hyun-a's parents decided to support their daughter.

Kwon Sun-il also dreamed of being a musician. His alumnus, Yong-in, suggested he join to make a trio.

Although the group debuted in 2009 as a nine-piece with four vocalists and five instrumentalists with the song "Café Latte (커피를 마시고)",<ref name="seoulbeats" /> there are currently only three vocalists due to artistic differences. Kwon Sun-il and his childhood friends, Jo Hyun-a and Park Yong-in write, compose and produce all of their own music.

Kwon won 1st place (singer) at [[S.M. Entertainment]]'s first SM Youth Best contest<ref>{{cite web|title=KYAA~ Urban Zakapa (Part 1) |website=go kpop |url=http://www.gokpop.com/news/kyaa-urban-zakapa-part-1-::11710.html |access-date=2014-11-05 |date=June 16, 2012}}</ref> and was a former SM Entertainment trainee with [[Super Junior]] and [[TVXQ]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Urban Zakapa's Kwon Soonil was almost a member of Super Junior |website=ohkpop |url=http://www.ohkpop.com/35265/urban-zakapas-kwon-soonil-was-almost-a-member-of-super-junior |access-date=2014-11-05 |date=November 4, 2012}}</ref> Park was part of the Korean [[rhythm and blues|R&B]]/[[soul music|Soul]] group Bluewind Soul with Han Won-jong, [[SG Wannabe]]'s Lee Suk-hoon and others.
