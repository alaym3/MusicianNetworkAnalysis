Billed as a "short film by Kendrick Lamar" on the album cover, the [[concept album]] follows the story of Lamar's teenage experiences in the drug-infested streets and [[Gangs in the United States|gang]] lifestyle of his native [[Compton, California|Compton]]. The album earned Lamar four [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] nominations at the [[56th Annual Grammy Awards|2014 Grammy Awards]], including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]].

All five singles achieved chart success of varying degrees.

After the release and success of his debut studio album ''[[Section.80]]'' (2011), [[Kendrick Lamar]] signed a major label [[recording contract|record deal]] with [[Interscope Records]] and [[Dr. Dre]]'s [[Aftermath Entertainment]]. He told ''[[HipHopDX]]'' that he did not want to work with high-profile producers, but with those he had established himself with, mainly producers from [[Top Dawg Entertainment|Top Dawg]]'s in-house production team, [[Digi+Phonics]].<ref name=hiphopdx1/>

In an interview for ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'', Lamar said that the album would not sound like ''Section.80'', but will return to his [[Compton, California|Compton]] roots: "I couldn't tell you what type of sound or where I [will] be in the next five years as far as music...

== Title and packaging ==
Before the album's title was officially revealed, fans had already been calling Lamar's major label debut ''Good Kid, Mad City'' or ''Good Kid in a Mad City'', as it was a nickname Lamar had given himself. He had used the phrase in his lyrics as early as the 2009 ''[[Kendrick Lamar (EP)|Kendrick Lamar]]'' EP.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kennedy |first=John |url=https://www.okayplayer.com/music/good-kid-maad-city-turns-five-encyclopedia-kendrick.html |title=The Encyclopedia of 'good kid, m.A.A.d city' |work=[[Okayplayer]] |date=October 20, 2017 |access-date=September 14, 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190915003419/https://www.okayplayer.com/music/good-kid-maad-city-turns-five-encyclopedia-kendrick.html |archive-date=September 15, 2019}}</ref> When he announced the album's title and release date, Lamar indicated that the "correct" rendering of the title is lowercase except for the two vowels in "''m.A.A.d''".<ref>{{cite web |last=Battan |first=Carrie |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/47001-kendrick-lamar-announces-lp-title-release-date/ |title=Kendrick Lamar Announces LP Title, Release Date |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=June 27, 2012 |access-date=September 14, 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602202102/http://pitchfork.com/news/47001-kendrick-lamar-announces-lp-title-release-date/ |archive-date=June 2, 2017}}</ref> The album's title mainly refers to Lamar's childhood innocence and how Compton affected his life. After keeping the album title's acronym concealed, Lamar later revealed ''M.A.A.D'' is an acronym with two meanings: "''My Angry Adolescence Divided''" and "''My Angels on [[phencyclidine|Angel Dust]]''", with Lamar stating: "That was me, [and it's] the reason why I don't smoke. It was just me getting my hands on the wrong thing at the wrong time [and] being oblivious to it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.21586/title.kendrick-lamar-explains-meaning-of-good-kid-maad-city-title-reveals-ti-collaboration/|title=Kendrick Lamar Explains Meaning of "good kid, m.A.A.d city" Title|work=HipHopDX|access-date=October 19, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021221300/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.21586/title.kendrick-lamar-explains-meaning-of-good-kid-maad-city-title-reveals-ti-collaboration/|archive-date=October 21, 2012}}</ref> The title has been interpreted as a reference to [[WC and the Maad Circle]], a Los Angeles-based hip hop group active in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |last=Soderberg |first=Brandon |url=https://www.spin.com/2012/11/10-records-that-paved-the-way-for-kendrick-lamars-good-kid-maad-city/ |title=10 Records That Paved the Way for Kendrick Lamar's 'good kid, m.A.A.d city' |work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |date=November 14, 2012 |access-date=September 14, 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729100605/http://www.spin.com/2012/11/10-records-that-paved-the-way-for-kendrick-lamars-good-kid-maad-city/ |archive-date=July 29, 2017}}</ref>

The cover artwork for ''Good Kid, M.A.A.D City'' features a baby Lamar, two of his uncles, and his grandfather, with the adults' eyes censored, possibly for privacy reasons. He explained that the reason why he had not censored his own eyes was that the album's story was told through his eyes, and is based around his experiences. The uncle who is holding Lamar also is displaying the [[Crips]] gang sign with his hand, and the poster above the head of the uncle features Lamar and his father.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ugwu |first=Reggie |url=http://www.bet.com/news/music/2012/09/19/kendrick-lamar-explains-good-kid-m-a-a-d-city-artwork.html |title=Kendrick Lamar Explains Good Kid, m.A.A.d city Artwork |publisher=[[BET]] |date=September 19, 2012 |access-date=October 1, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005092245/http://www.bet.com/news/music/2012/09/19/kendrick-lamar-explains-good-kid-m-a-a-d-city-artwork.html |archive-date=October 5, 2013 }}</ref>

=== Academic reception ===
In 2014, it was reported that ''Good Kid, M.A.A.D City'' was being studied as a text in the freshman composition class of [[Augusta University|Georgia Regents University]] professor Adam Diehl, alongside other [[coming of age]] works such as the [[James Joyce]] novel ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'', [[Gwendolyn Brooks]]' ''Selected Poems'', [[James Baldwin]]'s short story "[[Going to Meet the Man (short story)|Going to Meet the Man]]", and the [[John Singleton]] film ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]''. The theme of the class was meant to "inspire students to find an outlet to bring some sanity to our own mad city–Augusta", Diehl told ''HipHopDX''. "Lamar is the James Joyce of hip-hop", he said, "in the complexity of his storytelling, in his knowledge of the canon, and in his continuing focus on the city of his upbringing—Compton."<ref name="independent"/>
