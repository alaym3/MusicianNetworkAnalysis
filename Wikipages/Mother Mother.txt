==History==
===2005–2006: Early career===
The band began in Heriot Bay, British Columbia in January 2005, when guitarist and vocalist Ryan Guldemond was at music school and wanted to start a band based on vocal-driven pop songs.<ref name="owsegonian">{{cite web |title=Mother Mother Interview |last=Portoghese |first=Bill |date=May 2, 2011 |url=http://www.oswegonian.com/archives/3328/mother-mother-interview/ |work=[[The Oswegonian]] |access-date=July 1, 2012 }}</ref> He recruited his sister Molly along with a friend from college, Debra-Jean Creelman, to accompany his own vocals for the songs he had written, and the trio played as an acoustic act before adding drummer Kenton Loewen and bassist Jeremy Page.

The five members started off playing under the name Mother, and in the fall of 2005, they independently released a self-titled album. This debut album was recorded with [[Howard Redekopp]], who had also worked with the [[The New Pornographers|New Pornographers]] and [[Tegan and Sara]]. When the ''[[Vancouver Province]]'' rated Mother as one of the top five BC bands to watch for in 2007, they began to receive acclaim for their debut album. Shortly thereafter, Mother landed a nationally broadcast concert opening{{When|date=June 2011}} for [[K'naan]] and the [[The Wailin' Jennys|Wailin' Jennys]]. In the summer of 2006, they opened for the Australian band the [[The Cat Empire|Cat Empire]] at the sold-out [[Vancouver International Jazz Festival]]. Later that year, they made their debut in central Canada at the [[Montreal International Jazz Festival]] on June 29 as well as in [[Toronto]] on July 1, [[Canada Day]], at the [[Harbourfront Centre]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Festival Archives: Mother |work=[[Montreal International Jazz Festival]] |url=http://www.montrealjazzfest.com/program/concert.aspx?id=6117 |access-date=July 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218155125/http://www.montrealjazzfest.com/program/concert.aspx?id=6117 |archive-date=December 18, 2013 }}</ref><ref name="star-2006">{{cite news |title=Mother grows up quickly

===2006–2012: ''Touch Up'', ''O My Heart'', and ''Eureka''===
In October 2006, after playing a set at the [[Pop Montreal]] festival, Mother met with [[Last Gang Records]] and later signed a four-album contract. At that point, the label encouraged the band to change their name to avoid legal issues, and they renamed themselves Mother Mother. On February 20, 2007, the band re-released its debut album under the new name, renaming the album ''Touch Up'' and including two new songs, as well as artwork and overdubs different from the original.

Although Mother Mother had not released new music in two years, songs from their 2007 album, ''[[O My Heart]]'', went viral on the video-sharing platform [[TikTok]], causing their music to reach new streaming highs. The songs, in particular "Hayloft", "Arms Tonite", and "Wrecking Ball", became popular, with videos including cosplay and gothic fashion. Although no particular event caused the surge, the band's music did resonate with [[Non-binary gender|non-binary]] communities, as users played Mother Mother songs while discussing gender-related topics. <blockquote>Lead vocalist, [[Ryan Guldemond]], described the surge as a "high honor and huge compliment whenever it's suggested that our music might serve as an adequate soundtrack to a courageous journey of self-discovery that often rubs against societal norms". Guldemond further reiterated that their early music "really struggled to fit neatly into the industry standards of either a rock or pop format [...] I sang straight from my throat and had a much more androgynous tone. It was very rich with unisexual harmonies, as well as eccentric, quirky, daring lyrics. Perhaps it's just the right time for people to understand that music".<ref name="TikTok">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/mother-mother-viral-tiktok-charts-1079256/|title=TikTok Is Giving a Niche Indie Band's 2008 Music Millions of New Streams|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|last=Hissong|first=Samantha|date=October 22, 2020|accessdate=March 14, 2021}}</ref></blockquote>

Although the band had not planned on making new music, in October 2020, they stated to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' that they were completing their eighth album at [[The Warehouse Studio]] in Vancouver.
