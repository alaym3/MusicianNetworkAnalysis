In April 2018, Strauss launched a wildly successful [[Kickstarter]] campaign for her debut solo record ''Controlled Chaos''.

The first single "Our Most Desperate Hour" was released in September 2018 along with pre orders for the record on both CD and vinyl, with the vinyl completely selling out before release.
