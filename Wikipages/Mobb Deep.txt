==Biography==
===Early career===
Havoc and Prodigy met while both were students at the [[High School of Art and Design]] in Manhattan.<ref name="variety1">[https://variety.com/2020/music/news/havoc-mobb-deep-the-infamous-25-1234582900/ Barker, Andrew.

Accessed on March 12, 2018.</ref> The only artist who stopped to hear their music was [[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]] of [[A Tribe Called Quest]]; Prodigy recalled, "[Q-Tip] introduced us to [[Chris Lighty]] that day and a bunch of people in the [[Def Jam Recordings#Company history|Rush Associated Labels]] in the [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]] office—that's how we met everybody."<ref name="djbooth"/> Shortly after, Prodigy signed a solo demo deal with [[Jive Records]] and had an uncredited feature on the song "Too Young" by [[Hi-Five]], which appeared on the [[Boyz n the Hood (soundtrack)|''Boyz n the Hood'' soundtrack]].<ref name="rs"/> Jive decided not to sign Poetical Prophets as a duo, however, they were featured in the Unsigned Hype column of ''[[The Source]]'' in July 1991,<ref name="rs"/><ref>{{cite journal |title=Unsigned Hype |journal=[[The Source]] |issue=22 |date=July 1991 }}</ref> which helped promote their demo ''Flavor for the Nonbelievers''. The following year, the duo changed their name to "Mobb Deep" and signed with [[4th & B'way Records]], releasing the single "[[Peer Pressure (Mobb Deep song)|Peer Pressure]]" in promotion of their debut album ''[[Juvenile Hell]]''.<ref name="djbooth"/> The album was released in 1993, and later that year, Havoc made a guest appearance on the [[Black Moon (group)|Black Moon]] album ''[[Enta da Stage]]'', on a song titled "U da Man".

===Rise to success===
{{refimprove|section|date=March 2019}}
The group saw its first major success with their second album, ''[[The Infamous]]'', released in 1995.<ref name="LarkinDM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Dance Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1998|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0252-6|page=225}}</ref> Mobb Deep catapulted to the top of the hardcore hip-hop scene through Havoc and Prodigy's straightforward narration of street life.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> In this album, Mobb Deep portrayed the struggles of living in New York City's [[Queensbridge Houses]] where Havoc grew up.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> Following the release of ''The Infamous'', Mobb Deep became some of the most prolific artists of the East Coast. The production of this album was very dark and sample-based thanks to Havoc, who produced the beats from this point forward, although Q-Tip also contributed to the production and mixing.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/music/#/music/artist/mobb_deep/bio.jhtml Mobb Deep] ''MTV'', Accessed 24 July 2007</ref> Furthermore, the hit single "[[Shook Ones Part II]]", a remix to the hit "Shook Ones", received critical acclaim.<ref name="LarkinDM"/>

Mobb Deep's third album, ''[[Hell on Earth (Mobb Deep album)|Hell on Earth]]'' was released in 1996,<ref name="LarkinDM"/> debuting at number six on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard Album Chart]]; the album continued the duo's portrayal of harsh street life while further pushing them to the forefront of Hip Hop scene along with contemporary [[East Coast hip hop|East Coast Rappers]] like [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Jay-Z]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]] and fellow Queensbridge rapper [[Nas]]. Nas as well as [[Method Man]], [[Ghostface Killah]] and [[Raekwon]] of Wu-Tang Clan appear on ''Hell on Earth''.

In 1996, they appeared on the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s compilation CD, ''[[America is Dying Slowly]]'', alongside [[Biz Markie]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]] and [[Fat Joe]], among many other prominent hip hop artists. This compilation was solely meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic among African American men, and this compilation was heralded as "a masterpiece" by ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'' magazine. In 1997, Mobb Deep was featured on [[Frankie Cutlass]] ''Politics & Bullsh*t'' album track title, "Know Da Game", which also featured [[Kool G Rap]]. In 1998, the duo collaborated with reggae dancehall artist [[Bounty Killer]] on the track "Deadly Zone" for the soundtrack to ''[[Blade (film)|Blade]]'', and were a featured artist on the remix of [[Mariah Carey]]'s single "[[The Roof (Back in Time)]]", which was based around a sample of "Shook Ones Part II". In 1999, they released the ''[[Murda Muzik]]'' album which, despite extensive [[copyright infringement|bootlegging]], had the majority of its songs unintentionally leaked. This resulted in delays in the official album release. When the album was officially released, it eventually debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 and quickly received [[RIAA certification|Platinum]] certification and was further promoted by the popular single "[[Quiet Storm (song)|Quiet Storm]]". Shortly afterward, Prodigy released his solo album ''[[H.N.I.C. (Prodigy album)|H.N.I.C]]'' in which he collaborated with fellow artists like ([[B.G. (rapper)|B.G.]], [[N.O.R.E.]]) and producers (including [[The Alchemist (musician)|The Alchemist]], [[Rockwilder]] and [[Just Blaze]]).

===East Coast vs West Coast feud===
Mobb Deep was part of the infamous East Coast vs West Coast hip hop rivalry, that was fueled and increasingly promoted by the private media. The beef started when Snoop Dogg and the West Coast group, Tha Dogg Pound, released "[[New York, New York (Tha Dogg Pound song)|New York, New York]]" which Mobb Deep, along with [[Capone-N-Noreaga]] and [[Tragedy Khadafi]] responded with the song "[[L.A L.A]]" (This song can be found on Capone-N-Noreaga's debut album ''[[The War Report]]''). This song was released during rapper [[Tupac Shakur]]'s final days of incarceration. Members of Tupac's group, [[Outlawz]], allegedly attended a Mobb Deep concert; they then visited with Tupac over public rumoring that the duo had snubbed them at the concert. Tupac dissed Mobb Deep on multiple tracks, including: "Hit 'Em Up" and "When We Ride on Our Enemies" in which Tupac makes light of Prodigy's [[sickle-cell]] disease. Additional Tupac diss tracks include: "Bomb First (My Second Reply)" where Tupac said "You're barely breathin{{'"}} and "Against All Odds", both of which were released on Tupac's posthumous studio album, ''[[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory]]''. Mobb Deep retaliated on their 1996 release of ''[[Hell on Earth (Mobb Deep album)|Hell on Earth]]'', which contains a diss track entitled "Drop a Gem on 'Em".

"I was happy about it," Havoc told Jack Thriller. "The nigga saying our names. I didn't know what the fuck the beef was about. I didn't even care. I was like damn, did you hear that? 2Pac dissing us. We about to sell some records." Havoc also revealed that Mobb Deep had never even "crossed paths" with Shakur before his death in September 1996. He added, "And we never got a chance to cross paths with him because he passed away," he said. "I saw him from a long distance but I never met him. [I was a] Fan, but didn't even know him."

===2000–2010===
Mobb Deep released ''[[Infamy (album)|Infamy]]'' while in 2001 the song "[[Burn (Mobb Deep song)|Burn]]" (featuring [[Vita (rapper)|Vita]]) was perceived as a response to Jay-Z's [[wikt:diss song|diss song]] "Takeover" on ''[[The Blueprint]]'', as was "Crawlin'", in which Prodigy's two verses both mention Jay-Z. The album marked a major stylistic change in which the duo moved away from a raw, minimalist, stripped-down beat toward a commercial friendly in terms with such songs as "[[Hey Luv (Anything)]]". This transition fostered accusations of "[[selling out]]". In 2003, the group split with Loud Records and released ''Free Agents: The Murda Mix Tape'', in which Havoc and Prodigy proclaimed themselves "[[free agents]]" and addressed the group's split with its old label and its search for a new label. [[Jive Records]] signed the duo later in the year through a deal with the group's own imprint. Mobb Deep then released ''[[Amerikaz Nightmare]]'' in 2004. The record sold poorly and led to the group's departure from the label.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/music/#/music/artist/mobb_deep/bio.jhtml Mobb Deep and Jive Records split] ''MTV'', Accessed 24 July 2007</ref> Today, as a result of various mergers, all of Mobb Deep's studio albums from 1995 to 2004 are owned by [[Sony Music Entertainment]].

====G-Unit Records====
In June 2005, Mobb Deep announced they had signed with [[G-Unit Records]]. 50 Cent had a connection to Mobb Deep as he grew up in Queens & Havoc had provided production on projects by G-Unit, Lloyd Banks, The Game & Tony Yayo. Mobb Deep released their seventh album, [[Blood Money (Mobb Deep album)|Blood Money]] in 2006. It features G-Unit members 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo & Young Buck as well as [[Mary J. Blige]] and [[Nate Dogg]]. In 2006, Mobb Deep became the first American hip hop duo to perform in India, via VH1's Hip Hop Hustle. In late 2009, Mobb Deep were released from their contract with G Unit.

===2011–2017: Break-up, reunion, ''The Infamous Mobb Deep'' and death of Prodigy===
{{main|The Infamous Mobb Deep}}
On April 4, 2011, Mobb Deep released a new single called "Dog Shit", featuring rapper [[Nas]]. This was the first official song by Mobb Deep since Prodigy's release from jail. It was produced by [[Havoc (Mobb Deep)|Havoc]] and Alchemist.

On July 27, 2012, Havoc told AllHipHop in an interview that the group was on an indefinite hiatus. According to HipHopDX, Mobb Deep had a falling out after Havoc blasted Prodigy on [[Twitter]], and eventually, a sound clip leaked of him taking numerous shots at his former Mobb Deep partner during their concert at [[SXSW]]. At first, Havoc claimed that he was hacked. However, he later confirmed it was him and that he had originally denied it because he felt that Twitter was not a place to resolve a beef. He also stated that he had a diss track aimed at Prodigy in the making, "Same Shit Different Day".<ref>{{cite web |last=Horowitz |first=Steven J. |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.20589/title.havoc-says-mobb-deep-is-on-an-indefinite-hiatus-confirms-he-blasted-prodigy-on-twitter |title=Havoc Says Mobb Deep Is On An "Indefinite Hiatus," Confirms He Blasted Prodigy On Twitter |publisher=HipHop DX |date=2012-07-27 |access-date=2012-12-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104102455/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.20589/title.havoc-says-mobb-deep-is-on-an-indefinite-hiatus-confirms-he-blasted-prodigy-on-twitter |archive-date=2012-11-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The song later turned out to be "Separated (Real from the Fake)", which appeared on Havoc's solo album ''13''.

However, in January 2013 Prodigy said that he was sure he would record with Havoc in the future.<ref>{{cite web |last=Burgess |first=Omar |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.22499/title.prodigy-says-hes-sure-there-will-be-another-mobb-deep-album |title=Prodigy Says He's Sure There Will Be Another Mobb Deep Album &#124; Get The Latest Hip Hop News, Rap News & Hip Hop Album Sales |publisher=HipHop DX |date=2013-01-10 |access-date=2013-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024035351/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.22499/title.prodigy-says-hes-sure-there-will-be-another-mobb-deep-album |archive-date=2013-10-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Mobb Deep appeared on [[Papoose (rapper)|Papoose]]'s debut album ''[[The Nacirema Dream]]'' on the track "Aim, Shoot".

Around the May 2013 release of Havoc's third studio album, ''[[13 (Havoc album)|13]]'', Havoc announced that he and Prodigy had been in the studio for over a month working on the duo's eighth studio album which was already "halfway done". He also stated that he will be doing the entire production on the album.<ref>{{cite web |last=Meara |first=Paul |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.23913/title.havoc-says-that-prodigy-isn-t-gay-speaks-on-new-mobb-deep-album |title=Havoc Says That Prodigy Isn't Gay & Speaks On New Mobb Deep Album &#124; Get The Latest Hip Hop News, Rap News & Hip Hop Album Sales |publisher=HipHop DX |date=2013-05-12 |access-date=2013-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430180042/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.23913/title.havoc-says-that-prodigy-isn-t-gay-speaks-on-new-mobb-deep-album |archive-date=2015-04-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On April 1, 2014, the group released its eighth studio album, ''[[The Infamous Mobb Deep]]'', a double album that included one CD with original new music and one with unreleased tracks from sessions from ''The Infamous''.

On June 20, 2017, Prodigy died from accidental choking in Las Vegas, Nevada, while hospitalized for complications caused by sickle cell anemia.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/08/04/mobb-deep-rapper-prodigy-died-accidental-choking-coroners-office-confirms/539461001/|title=Mobb Deep rapper Prodigy died from accidental choking the coroner's office confirms|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2017-08-05|language=en}}</ref><ref name=Obit_Independent/>

==Legacy==
Mobb Deep helped popularize the 1990s slang called the "Dunn language", a term first recorded in the 1999 single "Quiet Storm", in which [[Prodigy (rapper)|Prodigy]] raps: "you's a dick blower, [you] tryin' to speak the Dunn Language?/ "what's the drilly" with that though? "It aint bangin"/ you hooked on Mobb phonics, Infamous [[Ebonics (word)|'bonics]]."

The term "dunn" supposedly originated in the Queensbridge housing projects with an acquaintance of Prodigy's, Bumpy, whose speech impediment prevented him from pronouncing the letter "S", such as in "son". The impediment encouraged him to put the tongue on the two front teeth/palate, making a 'th' or a 'd' sound. Mobb Deep has attempted to claim ownership of this body of slang; additionally, they were going to release an album called ''The Dunn Language'', in 2002, but the project was shelved, due to label issues.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mobb Deep Explains Origins Of Dun Language, Working With Q-Tip |url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.17017/title.mobb-deep-explains-origins-of-dun-language-working-with-q-tip |website=HipHopDX |access-date=27 April 2019 |date=27 September 2011}}</ref>

On September 15, 2018, during an interview for ''HipHop4Real'', Havoc stated that he was working on a new album Mobb Deep, which would be the duo's latest album. He is also working on a joint project Mobb Deep with [[The Alchemist (musician)|The Alchemist]], announced a few years ago.<ref name=hiphop4real>{{cite web| url=https://hiphop4real.com/havoc-interview-for-hiphop4real/ |title=Havoc (Mobb Deep), Big Noyd и DJ L.E.S.: эксклюзивное интервью для HipHop4Real| website=hiphop4real|access-date=2019-12-08}}</ref>

In December 2019, Havoc went on a "Murda Muzik 20th Anniversary Tour" with [[Big Noyd]] and [[L.E.S. (record producer)|L.E.S.]]<ref>{{cite web| url=http://imglink.ru/pictures/08-12-19/d5c5ccd559745d4b1ea4855f30483cd7.jpg |title=Murda Muzik 20th Anniversary Tour (December, 2019)| website=imglink.ru|access-date=2019-12-08}}</ref>
