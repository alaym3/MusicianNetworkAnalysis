'''Overkill''' is an American [[thrash metal]] band, formed in 1980 in [[New Jersey]]. They have gone through many line-up changes, leaving bassist [[D. D. Verni]] and lead vocalist [[Bobby Ellsworth|Bobby "Blitz" Ellsworth]] as the only constant members. In addition to Verni and Ellsworth, Overkill's current lineup includes Dave Linsk on lead guitar, Derek Tailer on rhythm guitar and [[Jason Bittner]] on drums.

They were one of the first thrash metal bands to sign to a major label (having signed to [[Atlantic Records]] in 1986), and rose to fame as part of the genre's movement of the mid-to-late 1980s, along with the "big four" ([[Metallica]], [[Megadeth]], [[Slayer]] and Anthrax) as well as [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]] and [[Testament (band)|Testament]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stereoboard.com/overkill-tickets|title=Overkill Tickets, Tour Dates & Concerts 2018|publisher=stereoboard.com|access-date=June 11, 2018}}</ref> Overkill achieved their first mainstream success with its second studio album and Atlantic debut, ''[[Taking Over (Overkill album)|Taking Over]]'' (1987), which peaked at number 191 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name="billboard 200">{{cite magazine |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=overkill|chart=all}}|title=Overkill Album & Song Chart History|magazine=Billboard.com|access-date=May 31, 2011}}</ref> The band's next five studio albums—''[[Under the Influence (Overkill album)|Under the Influence]]'' (1988), ''[[The Years of Decay]]'' (1989), ''[[Horrorscope (Overkill album)|Horrorscope]]'' (1991), ''[[I Hear Black]]'' (1993) and ''[[W.F.O.

==History==

===Early years and ''Feel the Fire'' (1980–1986)===
[[File:Overkill - Jalometalli 2008 - 02.JPG|thumb|upright|Verni (right) gave Ellsworth (left) the nickname "Blitz" due to his over the top lifestyle.]]
Overkill was formed in 1980 from the ashes of the [[punk rock|punk]] band "the Lubricunts", featuring bassist D. D. Verni and drummer Rat Skates. Verni and Skates placed an ad looking for a guitarist and lead singer which was answered by guitarist Robert Pisarek and singer Bobby Ellsworth and the first incarnation of Overkill was formed.<ref name="metal-rules1">{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-rules.com/metalnews/2008/05/03/rat-skates-ex-overkill/ |title=Interview With Rat Skates|publisher=Metal-Rules.com |date=May 3, 2008|access-date=November 26, 2013}}</ref> After rejecting several names, including "Virgin Killer," the band finally settled on "Overkill," named after Motörhead's [[Overkill (Motörhead album)|second album]].

Early covers, especially those done under the "Virgin Killer" name, were punk songs by the [[Ramones]], [[Dead Boys]] and others. By late 1980, the band's setlist was made up of songs by bands such as Motörhead (''[[Overkill (Motörhead song)|Overkill]]'' and half of the ''[[Ace of Spades (album)|Ace of Spades]]'' album), [[Judas Priest]] ("Tyrant" was their closer), and [[Riot V|Riot]]. Along with the new influx of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] covers, the band still played a smattering of punk covers, with extra distortion, intensity, and speed. In 1981, the band went through a succession of guitarists after Robert Pisarek left, first being replaced by Dan Spitz and Anthony {{not a typo|Ammendola}}, then Rich Conte and Mike Sherry, before settling with Bobby Gustafson in late 1982/early 1983.{{r|metal-rules1}} It was around this time that the band started writing original songs, including "Grave Robbers" (later renamed "Raise the Dead"), "Overkill", and "Unleash the Beast (Within)". More songs would follow, such as "Death Rider" (1981) and "Rotten to the Core" (1982). As the band continued to write songs, they became a staple at New York and New Jersey clubs, such as L'Amours.

In 1983, the lineup of Verni, Skates, Ellsworth, and Gustafson released the ''[[Power in Black]]'' demo, a recording that made as much impact in the underground tape trading circuit as demos by then-up-and-coming [[Bay Area thrash metal]] bands such as Exodus and Testament. ''Power in Black'' gained the band two compilation appearances. "Feel the Fire" was included on ''New York Metal '84'' and "Death Rider" appeared on volume V of [[Metal Blade Records]]' ''[[Metal Massacre]]'' series. The success of ''Power in Black'' enabled the band to secure a small recording deal with Azra/Metal Storm Records that resulted in the 1985 four-track EP ''[[Overkill (EP)|Overkill]]'', which quickly sold out, instantly pushing the band to the forefront of the fledgling thrash metal movement. Long out of print, the vinyl-only EP is now considered a rare collector's item and all the songs appeared eleven years later on the compilation album ''[[Fuck You and Then Some|!!!Fuck You!!! and Then Some]]''.

Though it is said that the band never saw any money from the release, the ''Overkill'' EP garnered the band massive underground interest, and the attention of [[Jon Zazula]], owner of [[Megaforce Records]], one of the most prominent independent heavy metal record labels at the time. Megaforce signed Overkill to a multi-album record contract and released their full-length debut album ''[[Feel the Fire (Overkill album)|Feel the Fire]]'' in 1985. Hailed by many critics and fans as a thrash metal masterpiece, the album cemented the band's position as one of the driving forces of the East Coast thrash movement. The band spent the better part of 1985 and 1986 touring in support of ''Feel the Fire'', touring Europe with Anthrax and [[Agent Steel]], and supporting Slayer on their ''[[Reign in Blood]]'' tour in North America.<ref name="metallipromo">{{cite web|title=Overkill Tour Dates|url=http://www.metallipromo.com/ov.html|publisher=metallipromo.com|date=May 8, 2018}}</ref> Overkill's grueling tour schedule and the growing buzz for ''Feel the Fire'' resulted in the band being courted by several major labels; they eventually signed to [[Atlantic Records]], making Overkill one of the earliest thrash metal bands to sign to a major label.<ref>{{cite web|title=Overkill - Wiki - Metal Amino|url=https://aminoapps.com/c/metal/page/item/overkill/RrzC_vIWEPoPdaKBoev5Y45D13aBdG1|publisher=aminoapps.com|access-date=December 19, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=NoFriender Thrash Metal Show Podcast - (Free) — When It Was Cool - Retro Pop Culture, Comics, Pro Wrestling, Toys, TV, Movies, and Podcasts|url=https://www.whenitwascool.com/nofriender-thrash-metal-show-podcast|publisher=whenitwascool.com|access-date=December 19, 2020}}</ref>

===Rise to success (1987–1990)===
Overkill's second album, ''[[Taking Over (Overkill album)|Taking Over]]'', was released in March 1987;{{r|metallipromo}} it was the first to be released by Megaforce in cooperation with [[Atlantic Records]]. The album featured longer songs and improved production. ''Taking Over'' also brought the band public recognition, becoming their first album to hit the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]],{{r|billboard 200}} while Overkill's first-ever music video "In Union We Stand" received moderate airplay on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Headbangers Ball]]''.<ref name="hbb">{{cite web|title=Headbangers Ball- The Unofficial Tribute Site - Episode Database|url=https://www.headbangersballunofficialtributesite.com/episode-database|website=headbangersballunofficialtributesite.com|date=April 23, 2021}}</ref> Another European tour followed, this time opening for [[Helloween]]. Overkill also opened for [[Megadeth]] on their ''[[Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?|Peace Sells]]'' [[Wake Up Dead Tour|tour]] in North America, and then headlined their own US tour, accompanied by Megaforce/Atlantic labelmates [[Testament (band)|Testament]].{{r|metallipromo}}
[[File:Bobby Gustafson 2014-01-30 11-33.png|thumb|right|Guitarist [[Bobby Gustafson]] was a member of Overkill from 1982 to 1990.]]

In late 1987, the ''[[!!!Fuck You!!!]]'' EP was released, consisting of a studio recording of the [[Subhumans (Canadian band)|Subhumans]]' song "Fuck You" as well as a handful of live tracks recorded earlier that year in [[Cleveland]]. 1987 also saw the departure of founding drummer [[Rat Skates]]. He was replaced by Mark Archibole for a short time, and then on a permanent basis by Danish drummer Bob "Sid" Falck, formerly of [[Paul Di'Anno]]'s Battlezone. Overkill closed out the year with a one-off show at the Christmas on Earth festival in [[Leeds|Leeds, England]], together with Megadeth, [[Kreator]], [[Nuclear Assault]], [[Voivod (band)|Voivod]], the [[Cro-Mags]], [[Lȧȧz Rockit]] and Virus.{{r|metallipromo}}

Overkill released their third album, ''[[Under the Influence (Overkill album)|Under the Influence]]'', in July 1988. Once again produced by [[Alex Perialas]], who had worked on the band's first two albums, ''Under the Influence'' was much more raw and thrashy, lacking most of the epic atmosphere heard on ''Taking Over''. "Hello from the Gutter" was released as a single, and its music video gained regular airplay on ''Headbangers Ball''.{{r|hbb}} Overkill kept up constant touring all over the world, furthering their reputation as one of the most active live metal bands; this included opening for Slayer on their ''[[South of Heaven]]'' tour in the United States and Europe, and performing with other bands such as Anthrax, Motörhead, [[Anvil (band)|Anvil]], Nuclear Assault, [[M.O.D.]], Testament, [[Vio-lence]], [[King's X]], [[Prong (band)|Prong]], [[Murphy's Law (band)|Murphy's Law]], [[Ludichrist]] and [[Znowhite]].{{r|metallipromo}}

Overkill released their fourth album, ''[[The Years of Decay]]'', in October 1989. Produced by [[Terry Date]] (who would later work with [[Pantera]], [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]] and [[Soundgarden]]), the album featured the band's best production value to date, as well as Overkill's most [[progressive metal|progressive]] and diverse work compared to their previous albums.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The 10 Best Overkill Albums Ranked|url=https://chaospin.com/best-overkill-albums/|access-date=October 14, 2021|website=Chaospin Magazine}}</ref> It combined the raw approach of ''Under the Influence'' with more complex song structures and epic elements of ''Taking Over'', resulting in a more serious atmosphere and longer songs, including the eight-minute title track and the ten-minute "Playing With Spiders/Skullkrusher", the latter is the longest track Overkill has recorded to date. Although the album charted lower than ''Under the Influence'' on the ''Billboard'' 200 at number 155,{{r|billboard 200}} ''The Years of Decay'' was a breakthrough album for Overkill, selling over 67,000 copies within the next decade-and-a-half,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metalsludge.tv/home/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=994&Itemid=39 |title=Metal Sludge - Sludge Scan For May 2000 - The Power & Glory since 1998 |access-date=May 24, 2021 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411215530/http://metalsludge.tv/home/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=994&Itemid=39 |archive-date=April 11, 2013 }}</ref> and includes one of the band's best-known songs "Elimination", for which a music video received regular airplay on MTV's ''Headbangers Ball''.{{r|hbb}} That song became a fan favorite and remains a staple in the band's live repertoire. Overkill toured relentlessly in support of ''The Years of Decay'' between November 1989 and June 1990, with bands such as Testament, [[Wolfsbane (band)|Wolfsbane]], [[Dark Angel (band)|Dark Angel]], [[Vio-lence]], [[Mordred (band)|Mordred]], [[Powermad]], [[Whiplash (band)|Whiplash]] and [[Excel (band)|Excel]].{{r|metallipromo}}

===''Horrorscope'', ''I Hear Black'' and ''W.F.O.'' (1990–1995)===
Not long after ''The Years of Decay'' tour ended in the summer of 1990,{{r|metallipromo}} Gustafson parted ways with Overkill. Accounts vary as to exactly how and why he had split with the band: he was either fired by Verni and Ellsworth, or had left Overkill following an argument over the band's musical direction.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/BobbyG.htm | title = Ex-Overkill Axeman Bobby Gustafson Returns To Metal With New Band RESPONSE NEGATIVE | access-date = 2019-12-06 | year = 2003 | publisher = [[Metal Rules]]}}</ref> Gustafson has stated that one of the reasons for his split with Overkill was due to disagreements over royalties, during which he became embroiled in a bitter feud with Verni and Ellsworth.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/ex-overkill-guitarist-bobby-gustafson-slams-former-bandmates-says-upcoming-dvd-is-a-piece-of-st/|title=Ex-OVERKILL Guitarist BOBBY GUSTAFSON Slams Former Bandmates, Says Upcoming DVD Is A 'Piece Of S**t'|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=March 17, 2018|access-date=March 17, 2018}}</ref> The remaining members added two new guitarists to the band; Rob Cannavino, who had been Gustafson's guitar technician, and [[Merritt Gant]], formerly of Faith or Fear. Ellsworth stated in an interview with ''[[Invisible Oranges]]'' years later that the reason Overkill had hired two guitarists was mainly because they wanted to do something different: "We knew if we replaced Bobby with one guitarist, we'd get compared to what we were. So, it seemed like to logical thing to bring in two players. We didn't want anyone to say, 'Bobby was better than this new guy.' And we wanted to perform old stuff with two guitars to keep in fresh. We realized that change isn't a bad thing."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/overkill-singer-bobby-blitz-ellsworth-doesnt-have-a-problem-with-bobby-gustafson-he-has-a-problem-with-me/|title=OVERKILL Singer BOBBY 'BLITZ' ELLSWORTH Doesn't Have A Problem With BOBBY GUSTAFSON: 'He Has A Problem With Me'|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=March 11, 2020|access-date=November 25, 2020}}</ref>

The "new" Overkill recorded their fifth album ''[[Horrorscope (Overkill album)|Horrorscope]]'', once again with [[Terry Date]], in 1991. Featuring the furious riffs and trade-off solos of new guitarists Cannavino and Gant, and the refined songwriting of Verni and Ellsworth, ''Horrorscope'' quickly silenced worries from fans the band would not recover from their split with Gustafson. Today, the album is widely regarded as one of Overkill's defining moments and is arguably their heaviest release. Focusing on a darker, heavier style, the album spawned the doomy single "Horrorscope", a departure from the band's earlier singles, which had traditionally been uptempo songs. ''Hororscope'' was also Overkill's first album to be accompanied by more than one music video or single; there were music videos for the title track and "Thanx for Nothin'" (both of which received some good airplay on ''Headbangers Ball''),{{r|hbb}} while other songs like "Coma", "Infectious" and the cover version of [[Edgar Winter]]'s "[[Frankenstein (instrumental)|Frankenstein]]" received particular attention (through radio or otherwise),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Overkill-Coma/release/3266484|title=Overkill - Coma (1991, Vinyl)|website=[[Discogs]]|access-date=April 23, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Overkill-Infectious/release/7405360|title=Overkill - Infectious (1991, CD)|website=[[Discogs]]|access-date=April 23, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.delphi.com/dkasper13/knac/knaca2z.html|title=KNAC A to Z Listing|website=people.delphi.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000305154225/http://people.delphi.com/dkasper13/knac/knaca2z.html|access-date=April 23, 2021|archive-date=March 5, 2000}}</ref> therefore expanding the band's popularity in the heavy metal community, and helping the album enter the Top 30 on the [[Top Heatseekers|''Billboard'' Heatseekers]] chart.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/horrorscope-mw0000674938/awards |title=Horrorscope – Overkill – Awards |publisher=[[AllMusic]].

Admittedly never a big fan of thrash metal music, Falck said that he had initially wanted to push his drumming to the limit by playing the most complex type of music (of the era), and in time he decided to pursue other musical interests.

Falck was replaced by former [[M.O.D.]] drummer Tim Mallare, with whom the next Overkill album ''[[I Hear Black]]'' was recorded. Released in March 1993, ''I Hear Black'' was produced by [[Alex Perialas]] (who previously produced their albums ''Taking Over'' and ''Under the Influence''), and was the first Overkill album released directly through [[Atlantic Records]]. The album once again presented a change in style, from the heavy thrash of ''Horrorscope'' to a more [[Stoner rock|stoner]]/[[Blues|blues rock]]-oriented style influenced by [[Black Sabbath]]. The eclectic nature of the album is often attributed to the fact that many different songwriters were involved. Verni and Ellsworth would handle most of the song writing themselves on subsequent albums, with only minor contributions from the other members. A music video was shot for "Spiritual Void" and it had received minor airplay on ''Headbangers Ball''.{{r|hbb}} The European leg of the 1993 "World Of Hurt Tour" featured [[Savatage]] and Non-Fiction as support acts.

Overkill's self-produced seventh album ''[[W.F.O.]]'' (which stands for "Wide Fuckin' Open", a common [[Motorcycle|biker]] term) was released on July 15, 1994 as an answer to the criticism that ''I Hear Black'' had received. The album presented a fast, heads-down, old school thrash metal style without any of the [[Experimental music|experimental]] elements present on ''I Hear Black'' in favor of a [[groove metal|groove]]-oriented sound.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ranking OVERKILL: The Studio Albums – Worst To First |url=https://metalnation.com/ranking-overkill-the-studio-albums-worst-to-first/ |website=Metal Nation |access-date=May 23, 2021}}</ref> The music video for "Fast Junkie" received little or no airplay from MTV, due to changing mainstream tastes and limited airplay availability for metal bands. Overkill continued to have bigger success overseas, mounting an extensive European tour in the fall, supported by [[Jag Panzer]] and [[Massacra]].

With [[grunge]] dominating the airwaves in the United States, many heavy metal radio stations changing formats and ''Headbangers Ball'' going off the air, ''W.F.O.'' failed to find an audience and in 1995 Overkill left Atlantic Records. Overkill were happy to leave the mainstream label, where they felt they received little or no attention and signed to different record companies around the world ([[CMC International]] in the US).

A March 1995 show, once again in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], was recorded for Overkill's first full-length live album, a 100-minute double CD entitled ''[[Wrecking Your Neck]]''. The album was released in April 1995, with the first pressing featuring a bonus CD containing the ''Overkill EP'' that had been out of print for ten years. A music video for the song "Bastard Nation" taken from ''Wrecking Your Neck'' was also released, but again failed to receive airplay in the US.

Late in 1995, both Cannavino and Gant decided to leave the band; Rob Cannavino to focus on motorcycle racing, and Merritt Gant to spend more time with his family. To everyone's surprise, Overkill then hired Joe Comeau, former singer of [[Liege Lord]] (now playing guitar).{{Citation needed|reason=The part about Cannavino and Gant leaving, and the reasons for doing so, is very specific. The part about Comeau claim that people were surprised. Who are the surprised people?|date=June 2018}} Comeau brought along former [[Anvil (band)|Anvil]] guitarist Sebastian Marino, with whom he had worked in the past. The new line up recorded ''[[The Killing Kind (album)|The Killing Kind]]'' in 1996, again self-produced and mixed by [[Chris Tsangarides]] ([[Judas Priest]]). While staying well within the thrash genre, the album was a departure from its predecessor's more traditional thrash metal style and featured different elements such as [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]], while the vocals showed influences from a broad spectrum of music. As Comeau was also a singer, backing vocals on ''The Killing Kind'' and subsequent albums were more elaborate and frequent than before, adding another element to the band's sound. Press response to ''The Killing Kind'' was very positive, but the album remains a hotly contested topic among the band's audience, with some longtime fans resistant to the new modern elements, and others hailing ''The Killing Kind'' as one of the band's finest moments.{{Citation needed|reason=Taste is a tricky thing to reference. A reference to the press response could probably add value to the article. The same goes for the debate about their old/new sound.|date=June 2018}}

Overkill toured Europe twice in support of ''The Killing Kind'' first in February 1996 with Megora and [[Accuser (band)|Accu§er]], and then again in November with Anvil and [[Stahlhammer]]. In the summer of 1996, Overkill appeared on Volume 2 of [[Century Media Records|Century Media's]] ''Legends of Metal – A Tribute to [[Judas Priest]]'' compilation, to which they contributed "Tyrant".

In summer 1997, the band released ''[[!!!Fuck You!!! and Then Some]]''. The album included the ''[[!!!Fuck You!!!]]'' EP, which had been out of print for some years, along with the classic ''Overkill EP'' and two live tracks from a 1990 promo single. October of the same year saw the release of the ninth Overkill studio album, titled ''[[From The Underground And Below]]''. This record retained some of the modern influences from ''The Killing Kind'', while also reincorporating elements from the band's earlier efforts. Some songs on ''From The Underground And Below'', including "Save Me", even had a slight [[industrial metal]] sound to them. Reportedly a video for the track "Long Time Dyin'" was shot, but received no television exposure.{{Citation needed|reason=Since it's a very specific factual claim a citation would lend credibility to the statement. Who did the reporting?|date=June 2018}} In 1998, once again the band opted to tour only Europe in support of the album, hitting the road with [[Nevermore]], [[Angel Dust (German band)|Angel Dust]] and [[Nocturnal Rites]].

In 1998, Ellsworth was diagnosed with a very aggressive form of nose cancer and underwent immediate surgery, stopping the cancer before it spread.{{Citation needed|reason=Specific factual claim about a living person. Considering this a citation is probably needed.|date=June 2018}} After his recovery, the band started work on their tenth studio album. The self-produced ''[[Necroshine]]'' was released in February 1999, making Overkill the first thrash metal band ever to release ten full-length studio albums (Other first wave thrash bands, such as [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]] or [[Kreator]] would not achieve this milestone until two years later). While once again quite different from the previous records and musically not considered "classic" Overkill, the album was vocally even more experimental than ''The Killing Kind'', and was well received by fans and critics alike.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Before the release of Necroshine, Sebastian Marino left Overkill to spend more time with his family. He was replaced by Dave Linsk from the New Jersey [[hardcore punk|hardcore]]/thrash metal band Anger On Anger. A two-week European trip in June was arranged to fill the gap between appearances at the [[Dynamo Open Air|Dynamo]] and [[With Full Force]] festivals.

September 1999 saw the release of ''[[Coverkill]]'', an album consisting entirely of cover versions from bands that were especially influential to Overkill, such as Black Sabbath (featured three times), [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], Motörhead, [[Manowar (band)|Manowar]], and [[The Ramones]]. Some of the tracks had been previously available on compilations or as bonus tracks, but others had been shelved for years (the earliest recording was from the ''[[Under the Influence (Overkill album)|Under the Influence]]'' sessions) or were recorded immediately prior to the album's release.{{Citation needed|reason=The part about when the songs were recorded is specific. As that is the case a citation would do make this section better.|date=June 2018}} A full European tour in support of both ''Necroshine'' and ''Coverkill'' took place in February 2000, as Overkill co-headlined with Canadian thrash metal band [[Annihilator (band)|Annihilator]], with the German band [[Dew-Scented]] in the opening slot.

During the European tour, Annihilator fired their lead singer [[Randy Rampage]] due to his disruptive behavior. A few months later, Joe Comeau was confirmed as his replacement, effectively ending his tenure with Overkill. The band returned to the studio, this time as a four-piece, and in the fall of 2000, released ''[[Bloodletting (Overkill album)|Bloodletting]]''. Once again produced by the band, and mixed by [[Colin Richardson]].

November of the same year saw the band again touring Europe as a special guest of [[Halford (band)|Halford]]'s "Resurrection" world tour. Since Overkill had not found a new rhythm guitarist yet, Comeau joined on a temporary basis for the tour. For the last couple of shows, the band also utilized another session musician. With D. D. Verni's wife about to give birth to their second child, Verni was to miss a week or two of shows and needed a fill-in. Derek Tailer of [[Dee Snider]]'s band S.M.F was asked to do the job. In 2002, Tailer was announced as a permanent member of Overkill, although not on bass, but filling the vacant rhythm guitarist position.

===Switching labels and drummers (2002–2008)===

After taking a break, Overkill resurfaced in 2002 with ''[[Wrecking Everything]]'', their second full-length live album, recorded at the Paramount Theatre in Asbury Park, New Jersey. The album contained only songs that had not been on ''Wrecking Your Neck'', some simply because they were released on later albums, but also a few early songs from albums such as ''[[Taking Over (Overkill album)|Taking Over]]'' and ''[[Under the Influence (Overkill album)|Under the Influence]]''. The same show was used for Overkill's first ever DVD, ''Wrecking Everything – An Evening in Asbury Park'', also released in 2002.

The European tour in June 2002, supporting both ''Bloodletting'' and ''Wrecking Everything'' saw [[Blaze Bayley|Blaze]] and Wicked Mystic opening up for Overkill. During the second to last show of the tour in Nuremberg, Germany, Blitz suffered a stroke on stage and collapsed. For nearly three days, rumors ran rampant, reporting everything from Blitz being in a coma, permanently paralyzed, or even that Blitz had died. Finally, three days later, the band announced that the stroke was very minor and had no lasting consequences, as well as no cause that could be determined by the doctors.

Overkill signed to [[Spitfire Records]] and entered the studio in late 2002 to record their next studio album, ''[[Killbox 13]]''. Produced by the band and Colin Richardson and released in March 2003, the album was actually only their twelfth regular studio album, but the ''Overkill EP'' was also counted to achieve the number 13. The album received critical acclaim,{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} combining the "new" Overkill with their raw early style as presented on the debut album ''[[Feel the Fire (Overkill album)|Feel the Fire]]''. Touring for the album included a number of European festivals during the summer, and a full European tour followed in November with [[Seven Witches]] and After All. The band played without Derek Tailer, who was absent for undisclosed reasons. Nobody was hired to fill in for him, so Overkill toured as a four-piece for the first time since 1990. Tailer was still considered a full member of the band.

In late 2004, after a Japanese tour with [[Death Angel]] and [[Flotsam and Jetsam (band)|Flotsam and Jetsam]], the band started work on another record in D. D. Verni's own recording studio. The album, ''[[ReliXIV]]'', was produced and mixed by the band themselves and released in March 2005.

Overkill toured the eastern US in April 2005, and just before they went on a European tour in May, it was announced that Tim Mallare would not take part in this tour. Replacing him for the tour was former Hades drummer Ron Lipnicki. A few weeks later, the band announced that Mallare had left permanently and Lipnicki was his replacement. In the summer of 2005, Overkill organized their first US west coast tour in more than ten years, playing Western Canada to Southern California. The tour was such a success that the band was added to the 2006 [[Gigantour]] bill, as second stage headliners, marking Overkill's first nationwide US tour since 1994.

Now with the Bodog Music label, the band rejoined forces with Jonny and Marsha Zazula, previous owners of Megaforce Records, who are now part of the Bodog Team in the United States. Overkill released its 15th studio album, ''[[Immortalis (album)|Immortalis]]'', on October 9, 2007. The album featured the lineup of founders Bobby "Blitz" Ellsworth and D. D. Verni, guitarists Dave Linsk and Derek Tailer, and new drummer Ron Lipnicki. [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]] vocalist [[Randy Blythe]] contributed vocals on the song "Skull and Bones".

===Return to popularity and departure of Lipnicki (2009–2017)===
On October 30, 2009, it was reported that Overkill had inked a multi-album deal with [[Nuclear Blast Records]]. The band's 15th album, ''[[Ironbound (album)|Ironbound]]''—which is described as a true "thrashter-piece"—was released on February 9, 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=129550 |title=Overkill Signs With Nuclear Blast Records |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=December 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112200924/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/Blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=129550 |archive-date=November 12, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The album marked something of a "comeback" for Overkill after years of lackluster record sales and a decline in popularity in the U.S. since the mid-1990s;{{r|billboard 200}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Overkill - Ironbound |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/showreview.aspx?reviewID=1900 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |access-date=3 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228191851/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/showreview.aspx?reviewID=1900 |archive-date=28 February 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Louise |last=Brown |title=OVERKILL INTERVIEW: "YOU NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO KNOW WHERE YOU'VE COME FROM" |url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/34789/Overkill-Ironbound/ |publisher=ironfistzine.com |access-date=15 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Jesuslaves |title=Overkill - Ironbound (album review 2) |url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/34789/Overkill-Ironbound/ |publisher=[[Sputnikmusic|Sputnikmusic.com]] |access-date=15 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Rustyn |last=Rose |title=Ranking OVERKILL: The Studio Albums – Worst To First |url=https://metalnation.com/ranking-overkill-the-studio-albums-worst-to-first/3/ |publisher=metalnation.com |access-date=15 November 2020}}</ref> it was also the band's first album to appear on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart since 1993's ''[[I Hear Black]]'', peaking at number 192.{{r|billboard 200}}<ref name="ironbound sales">{{Cite web|url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/overkill-ironbound-first-week-sales-revealed/|title=OVERKILL: 'Ironbound' First-Week Sales Revealed|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=November 15, 2020}}</ref> The band happened to be playing at Times Square in New York City on May 1, 2010, as part of their ''Ironbound'' tour when someone nearby attempted unsuccessfully to blow a car up using fireworks.

==Legacy and style==
Though less popular than larger bands of the same genre, Overkill is one of the oldest thrash metal bands performing today. Although their [[Feel the Fire (Overkill album)|debut album]] was not released until 1985, Overkill's beginnings predate the formation of all of the "Big Four" of thrash metal bands (Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer) by at least one year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/bobby_blitz_ellsworth_of_overkill/|title=Bobby "Blitz" Ellsworth of Overkill : Songwriter Interviews|website=www.songfacts.com|access-date=November 1, 2016}}</ref> After the band's inception, as time passed and Overkill began creating more music alongside its quickly-growing competitors, it became known for its fast and heavy style. The band's music lacked enough variety to rival the names of the "Big Four",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/overkill/id263455457|title=Overkill on Apple Music|website=iTunes|access-date=November 1, 2016}}</ref> but Overkill maintained its unique sound unwaveringly throughout its career instead of trying to gain popularity with a more commercial style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nolifetilmetal.com/overkill.htm|title=No Life Til Metal - CD Gallery - Overkill|website=www.nolifetilmetal.com|access-date=November 1, 2016}}</ref> Overkill has been viewed as one of the most important thrash bands from the East Coast,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fullinbloommusic.com/overkill-biography-dd-verni-blitz-ellsworth.html|title=Overkill - Biography - Bobby Blitz Ellsworth - DD Verni - Taking Over - The Years of Decay|website=www.fullinbloommusic.com|access-date=November 1, 2016}}</ref> and they are considered to be one of the most active bands of the genre; unlike many of their thrash peers, Overkill has never broken up or gone on hiatus, nor released a new studio album in more than three years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/overkill-albums-ranked/|title=Overkill Albums Ranked|website=[[Loudwire]]|access-date=October 11, 2019}}</ref>

Along with Exodus and Testament, Overkill has been the subject of which thrash metal band should be included in an expanded "Big Four". Asked in September 2014 about the idea of either Overkill, Exodus or Testament being included in the "Big Five" of thrash metal, frontman Bobby Ellsworth replied, "Aw man, that's gonna put me in a corner! We measure our success in days, not dollars! But maybe you can find the answer in what I'm going to say. When [playing thrash metal] became harder in the '90s with grunge music, we never had a question about if we would stop doing it and go work for our moms and dads or something. We just needed to make it happen. We weren't going to let grunge stop us. And if it did, we'd just go back to the underground. I liked it there anyway!"<ref>{{cite web|title=Would OVERKILL, TESTAMENT Or EXODUS Be Included In Expanded 'Big Four'?

When you talk numbers, numbers make the world go around, numbers put food on your table, and numbers put the 'Big Four' in arenas. And they sell enough records to do that. For me, it's not a concern. To even be asked the question from you is quite a compliment with regard to, let's say, our longevity or tenacity doing what we like doing. But this is quite simply an accounting issue.
