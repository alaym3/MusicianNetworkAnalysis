==History==
Shoreline Mafia was composed of four members: OhGeesy (real name: Alejandro Coranza), Rob Vicious (Robert Maggee), Fenix Flexin (Fenix Rypinski) and Master Kato (Malik Carson).<ref name="UPR">{{cite news | last=Williams| first=Aaron| title =Shoreline Mafia Gets A Big Budget Update For Their Raucous 'Musty' Video After Signing To Atlantic| publisher =Uproxx| date = 8 May 2018 | url =https://uproxx.com/hiphop/shoreline-mafia-musty-video/| accessdate =14 November 2018}}</ref> Ohgeesy and Fenix met in 2012 while doing [[graffiti]] in Los Angeles. The pair began making music soon after, and, sometime later, Rob Vicious and Master Kato joined them. Although they produced music for several years, they did not become a rap group until 2016. They chose the name Shoreline Mafia at some point after their formation.<ref name="XXLBreak">{{cite news | last=Seabrook III| first=Robby| title =The Break Presents: Shoreline Mafia| publisher =XXL| date = 26 January 2018| url =http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/01/shoreline-mafia-interview-the-break/| accessdate =14 November 2018}}</ref>

In November 2017, they independently released their first full-length mixtape, ''ShoreLineDoThatShit''. The album featured songs such as "Nun Major," "Musty," and "Bottle Service". Most of the songs on the album were produced by Ron-Ron including "Musty" and "Bottle Service", the beats for which the group was not initially authorized to use. Despite this, the two parties eventually formed a partnership that continues to exist.<ref name="XXLBreak"/><ref name="FaderUnruly">{{cite news | last=Thompson| first=Paul| title =Shoreline Mafia is leading L.A.'s unruly rap renaissance | publisher =The Fader| date =29 May 2018 | url =https://www.thefader.com/2018/05/29/shoreline-mafia-musty-atlantic-records-interview| accessdate =14 November 2018}}</ref><ref name="WPListen">{{cite news | last=Richards| first=Chris| title =Listening to Los Angeles rap music feels like eavesdropping on the future| newspaper =The Washington Post| date =31 August 2018 | url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/listening-to-los-angeles-rap-music-feels-like-eavesdropping-on-the-future/2018/08/30/2a99701e-ab8b-11e8-b1da-ff7faa680710_story.html| accessdate =14 November 2018}}</ref> In December of that year, the group performed at the [[Rolling Loud]] Festival in [[San Bernardino]], [[California]].<ref name="High">{{cite news | last=Medranda| first=Julian| title =Rolling Loud: The world's biggest hip-hop festival takes on SoCal| newspaper =The Highlander| date =8 January 2018 | url =https://highlandernews.org/31577/rolling-loud-worlds-biggest-hip-hop-festival-takes-socal/| accessdate =14 November 2018}}</ref> In the spring of 2018, the group headlined their "Only The Xclusives" (OTX) tour.<ref name="XXLBreak"/>
