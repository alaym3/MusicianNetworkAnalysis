'''Get Scared''' was an American [[post-hardcore]] band from [[Layton, Utah]], United States, active from 2008 to 2019. After their formation they released their first EP ''Cheap Tricks and Theatrics'' in 2009. A [[Get Scared (EP)|self-titled EP]] followed several months later in 2010. The band's debut studio album, ''[[Best Kind of Mess]]'', was released on July 12, 2011. Following Nicholas Matthews' first departure to join Blacklisted Me, the band released ''Cheap Tricks and Theatrics B-Sides'' on December 19, 2011, without any previous announcements. Matthews was replaced by Joel Faviere near the end of 2011. The band's third EP and first with Faviere, ''[[Built for Blame, Laced With Shame]]'', was released in 2012; Faviere was kicked out a few months after the EP's release when Matthews rejoined the band. Following Matthews' comeback, the band signed with [[Fearless Records]] and released their second full-length album, ''[[Everyone's Out To Get Me]]'', on November 11, 2013. The band's third studio album, ''[[Demons (Get Scared album)|Demons]]'', was released on October 30, 2015, and marked a departure from the band's [[post-hardcore]] sound featured on ''Built for Blame'' and ''Everyone's Out to Get Me'' in favor of a more [[metalcore]]-like sound. Their fourth and final album, ''The Dead Days'', was released on April 19, 2019 amidst a hiatus; it was later stated by vocalist Nicholas Matthews that the band had broken up due to multiple issues between the band members.

===Early years, ''Best Kind of Mess'' and ''Built for Blame, Laced With Shame'' (2008–2013)===
Before forming the band, Nicholas Matthews, Johnny Braddock, Bradley Iverson and Warren Wilcock were all in separate bands. The four came together to form the band and self-released their first EP, ''[[Cheap Tricks and Theatrics]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/36722/Get-Scared-Cheap-Tricks-and-Theatrics/|title=Get Scared - Cheap Tricks and Theatrics (album review ) {{!}} Sputnikmusic|website=Sputnikmusic.com|access-date=2019-12-01}}</ref>

During summer 2010, the band went on [[Hot Topic]]'s ''Sacred Ceremony'' tour with [[Black Veil Brides]] and [[Vampires Everywhere!]], helping promote the band's music. The band then embarked on several tours, notably the first leg of ''The Dead Masquerade Tour'' (with [[Escape the Fate]], [[Alesana]], Drive A and [[Motionless in White]]) from January to March 2011<ref>{{cite web| author = Fowler, Aaron | url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/escape_the_fate_announce_the_dead_masquerade_tour/ |title=Escape the Fate Announce The Dead Masquerade Tour | work = [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] |date= November 17, 2010 |access-date= September 24, 2011}}</ref> and an [[Aiden]] headliner including [[Eyes Set To Kill]], [[Dr. Acula (band)|Dr. Acula]], [[Vampires Everywhere!]], and [[Escape the Fate]] (only certain dates) in the spring of 2011.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nick Karp |url=http://rewritethescene.com/tour-aiden-vampires-everywhere-get-scared-dr-acula-featuring-escape-the-fate/ |title=[Tour&#93; Aiden/ Vampires Everywhere/ Get Scared/ Dr. Acula (Featuring Escape the Fate) |website=Rewritethescene.com |date= April 4, 2011 |access-date= February 18, 2013}}</ref> On July 12, 2011, they released their debut full-length album ''[[Best Kind of Mess]]'', their first release through Universal Motown Records featuring mastered remakes of the songs "Setting Yourself Up for Sarcasm" and "If She Only Knew Voodoo Like I Do" with the shortened names "Sarcasm" and "Voodoo". The band embarked on the ''Fuck You All Tour'' with [[Dr. Acula (band)|Dr. Acula]] and [[Girl On Fire (band)|Girl On Fire]]  in support of the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/aiden-eyes-set-to-kill-get-scared-vampires-everywhere-dr-acula/Event?oid=3789471|title=Aiden, Eyes Set to Kill, Get Scared, Vampires Everywhere, Dr. Acula|website=Chicagoreader.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-01}}</ref>

On November 30, 2011, the band announced that Matthews was leaving the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/notes/get-scared/vocalist-nicholas-matthews-parts-ways-with-get-scared/252001148187577 |title=Vocalist (Nicholas Matthews) parts ways with Get Scared |website=Facebook.com |access-date=October 10, 2015}}</ref> They stated that Matthews wanted to pursue more options in his musical career with Blacklisted Me and that it was a surprise to the entire band. The band postponed any touring dates until further notice due to the sudden departure and lack of a lead vocalist. In the same message, they also announced that they would be holding auditions for lead vocalist.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

The band re-entered the studio with the new lead vocalist on December 28. Although it was not officially announced who the new vocalist was, at the time there was much speculation that former Dear Chandelier singer Joel Faviere replaced Matthews, due to the tweets sent by Faviere and some of the members of Get Scared on [[Twitter]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cityofpunk.tumblr.com/post/15032132628/get-scared-new-singer |title=Get Scared new singer? &#124; City Of Punk |website=Cityofpunk.tumblr.com |date=December 30, 2011 |access-date=October 10, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.purevolume.com/dearchandelier |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914205018/http://www.purevolume.com/dearchandelier |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-09-14 |title=Dear Chandelier on PureVolume |access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> It was later made official that Faviere was the new lead vocalist. The team also welcomed new guitarist Adam Virostko to the band that following September 2012 to play The Pizza Party Tour with Dead Rabbits. Virostko became a permanent member that fall being formally announced on November 21, 2012. Faviere was the singer of the band for a short time until the return of Matthews on November 19, 2012. Only one EP, ''[[Built for Blame, Laced With Shame]]'', was released during Faviere's tenure with the band.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} Faviere was arrested for 4,500 counts of child pornography in 2017. <ref>https://www.altpress.com/news/ex_get_scared_vocalist_arrested_in_child_pornography_sting/</ref>

The band entered the studio in November 2017 with producer [[Kris Crummett]] to record their fourth studio album. The album had a tentative release date of 2018,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/WeGetScared/status/929159400756887552|title=Guess what pic.twitter.com/WGfoXIY2oN|first=Get|last=Scared|date=November 10, 2017|website=twitter.com|access-date=April 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/WeGetScared/status/947739426129670144|title=Who's ready for new music this year?|first=Get|last=Scared|date=January 1, 2018|website=twitter.com|access-date=April 18, 2019}}</ref> but it did not come to pass. On January 9, 2019, guitarist Johnny Braddock announced the band was on a hiatus as vocalist Nicholas Matthews recovers from a heroin addiction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0XL4tApHwU |title=Get Scared Hiatus EXPLAINED |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2019-01-09 |access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> Several days later, Matthews announced he had left the band.<ref name="imgur1">{{cite web|url=https://imgur.com/a/2GQHmhT|title=Imgur|website=Imgur.com|access-date=April 18, 2019}}</ref><ref name="instagram1">{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs_RujYn-bn/|title=Nicholas Matthews on Instagram: "Looking for anyone in the LA area that wants to work on music and has a place to record/write.

On April 10, 2019, Johnny Braddock announced ''The Dead Days'' would be released on April 19, 2019.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.altpress.com/news/get-scared-new-album-the-dead-days-hiatus/ | title=Get Scared drop long-awaited album amid hiatus| date=April 19, 2019}}</ref> On September 15, 2019, Nicholas Matthews posted an explanation video; after someone asked in the comments if the band had broken up, Matthews stated "unfortunately that is correct". He then went on to state:
{{Quote box
 |quote  = I know it’s upsetting, you have no idea how hard it’s been for me to accept. Especially because I had no choice in any of it. None of our band did, except for Johnny. He’s got all of the log ins to all of our social media, bank account, phone bills, YouTube. Literally everything. Which is why I had to make an entirely new YouTube even to post this video. It’s also the only reason why he was able to take complete control over Get Scared’s fate and decide exactly what fans should and shouldn’t hear. He then started using all of the accounts for get scared as his own personal promoting setting for his new solo album without any of us having any ounce of say or control over anything he has been posting about it. Everything he said about me, and Get scared was entirely done on his own without consulting any of us in the band before hand. There was a motive behind everything that he did. Which was to end get scared on his own recognizance to break off from us, and use get scareds success to promote his new solo career. (Which he has used my own personal templates to help create some of his songs) And as much as he wants to act like that’s not true, I’ve got me and the rest of my band who can vouch for that. I’ve been texting him/calling him for almost an entire year now and he refuses to respond. So that’s kind of an overview which still doesn’t go into everything else he’s done or is doing.

==Controversy==
On February 15, 2017, the band's former lead singer Joel Faviere was arrested on [[child pornography]] charges during an undercover sting.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/ex_get_scared_vocalist_arrested_in_child_pornography_sting/|title=Ex-Get Scared vocalist arrested in child pornography sting|date=February 15, 2017|website=altpress.com|access-date=April 18, 2019}}</ref> The band released a statement stating "his time in the band was very short, [but] we feel he has tarnished the very name we worked so hard to build up for the past 9 years" and apologizing "to those of you who have been hurt or affected by this man’s actions." They also encouraged people to donate to the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/ex-get-scared-vocalist-joel-faviere-arrested-in-child-porn-sting|title=Ex Get Scared vocalist Joel Faviere arrested in child porn sting|first=Scott Munro2017-02-17T11:45:00 470Z Metal|last=Hammer|website=Metal Hammer Magazine|access-date=April 18, 2019}}</ref>
