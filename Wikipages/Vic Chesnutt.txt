'''James Victor Chesnutt''' (November 12, 1964&nbsp;– December 25, 2009) was an American singer-songwriter from [[Athens, Georgia]]. His first album, [[little (album)|''Little'']], was released in 1990,<ref>Khanna, Vish.[http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=115&csid2=4&fid1=27887 "Vic Chesnutt's Star Power"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116200727/http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=115&csid2=4&fid1=27887 |date=November 16, 2007 }}, ''[[Exclaim!]]'', October 2007.</ref> but his breakthrough to commercial success did not come until 1996 with the release of ''[[Sweet Relief II: Gravity of the Situation]]'', a [[charity record]] of alternative artists covering his songs.<ref name="nyt_12252009">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/26/arts/music/26chesnutt.html|title=Vic Chesnutt, Singer and Songwriter, Dies at 45|last=Sisario|first=Ben|author-link=Ben Sisario|date=December 25, 2009|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=December 25, 2009}}</ref>

Chesnutt released 17 albums during his career, including two produced by [[Michael Stipe]], and a 1996 release on [[Capitol Records]], ''[[About to Choke]]''.  His musical style has been described by Bryan Carroll of [[allmusic.com]] as a "skewed, refracted version of [[Americana (music)|Americana]] that is haunting, funny, poignant, and occasionally mystical, usually all at once".<ref name="amg_westofrome">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r182207|pure_url=yes}}|title=West of Rome: Overview|last=Carroll|first=Bryan|publisher=[[Allmusic]].com|access-date=December 27, 2009}}</ref>

Injuries from a 1983 car accident left him partially paralyzed; he used a wheelchair and had limited use of his hands.

==Early life==
An adoptee, Chesnutt was raised in [[Zebulon, Georgia]], where he first started writing songs at the age of five. When he was 13, Chesnutt declared that he was an atheist, a position that he maintained for the rest of his life.<ref name=Survival/>

H. Auden]], [[Stephen Crane]] and [[Emily Dickinson]]) served to inspire and influence him.<ref name="encyclo"/>

==Early career and films==
Around 1985, Chesnutt moved to Athens and joined the band
[[La-Di-Das]] with future member of the [[Dashboard Saviors]] Todd McBride.<ref name="encyclo">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?path=/TheArts/Music/RockandPop/IndividualArtistsandMusicalGroup-3&id=h-968|title=Vic Chesnutt (1964–2009)|last=Dixon|first=Al|date=December 1, 2009|encyclopedia=[[New Georgia Encyclopedia]]|access-date=December 25, 2009}}</ref><ref name=VV>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/archives/2008/10/exclusive_download_vic_chesnutt_and_elf_power_little_fucker.php|title=Exclusive Download: Vic Chesnutt and Elf Power, 'Little Fucker'|date=October 30, 2008|work=[[The Village Voice]]|access-date=January 6, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419232753/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/archives/2008/10/exclusive_download_vic_chesnutt_and_elf_power_little_fucker.php|archive-date=April 19, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> After leaving that group, he began performing solo on a regular basis at the [[40 Watt Club]]; it was there that he was spotted by Michael Stipe of [[R.E.M.]] Stipe went on to produce Chesnutt's first two albums,  ''[[Little (album)|Little]]'' (1990) and ''West of Rome'' (1991).<ref name="encyclo"/>

In 1993, Chesnutt was the subject of filmmaker [[Peter Sillen]]'s independently produced documentary, ''Speed Racer: Welcome to the World of Vic Chesnutt'', which was shown on [[PBS]]. Chesnutt also had a small role as "Terence" in the 1996 [[Billy Bob Thornton]] movie ''[[Sling Blade]]'', which he later described self-mockingly as a poor performance.<ref name=VV/>

In 1996, Chesnutt was exposed to a wider audience with the release of the charity record ''[[Sweet Relief II: Gravity of the Situation]]'', the proceeds from which went to the [[Sweet Relief Fund]]. The album consisted of Chesnutt covers by famous musicians including [[R.E.M.]],[[Indigo Girls]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] with her brother-in-law [[Joe Henry]], [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]], [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] (with [[Red Red Meat]]), [[Cracker (band)|Cracker]], [[Soul Asylum]], and [[Live (band)|Live]].

For the 2007 edition of the [[Vienna International Film Festival]] (Viennale), New York filmmaker [[Jem Cohen]] was commissioned to close the festival, which he did with his program titled, ''Evening's Civil Twilight in Empires of Tin.'' An impressionistic narrative was constructed through live readings from the texts of [[Joseph Roth]] and a live musical score performed by Vic Chesnutt, members from [[Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra]], Guy Piciotto ([[Fugazi]]), and The Quavers. The music includes improvisations, interpretations of [[Johann Strauss I]]'s "[[Radetzky March]]", and renditions of a number of Vic Chesnutt songs. The result was a string of film vignettes bound by the poetry of Roth's writing and by the sounds and songs of the live musicians. A DVD of the program was released in 2009.

==Collaborations==

Chesnutt's 1998 album ''[[The Salesman and Bernadette]]'' was recorded with [[alternative country|alt-country]] group [[Lambchop (band)|Lambchop]] as the backing band. The album ''[[Merriment (album)|Merriment]]'' was a collaborative effort between Chesnutt and Kelly and Nikki Keneipp, with Chesnutt writing and singing the songs, and the Keneipps playing the music.

Chesnutt was featured singing on the title track of [[Elf Power]]'s 2004 release, ''[[Walking with the Beggar Boys]]''.

The 2005 album ''Ghetto Bells'' featured famed guitarist [[Bill Frisell]], whom Chesnutt met in 2004 at the [[Century of Song]] concert series at the German festival [[Ruhrtriennale]]. ''Ghetto Bells'' also featured lyricist and composer [[Van Dyke Parks]] on accordion and keyboards. Chesnutt's wife, Tina, would frequently play bass on his albums, including ''Ghetto Bells''. His niece, and fellow songwriter, [[Liz Durrett]] also appeared on the album.

In the winter of 2006, he recorded ''[[North Star Deserter]]'' at the [[Hotel2Tango]] in [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada. It was released on September 11, 2007 by [[Constellation Records (Canada)|Constellation Records]]. The record included contributions from Constellation artists [[Thee Silver Mt.

[[Mark Linkous]] had previously attempted to collaborate with Chesnutt on the Sparklehorse album ''[[Good Morning Spider]];'' however, Chesnutt was unable to feature in person on the album. Instead, a recorded voice message he left Linkous apologising for his inability to show was used on the song "Sunshine".

==Label history==
Chesnutt's first four albums were released on the independent [[Texas Hotel Records|Texas Hotel]] label. He then recorded ''[[About to Choke]]'' (1996) for Capitol Records.

Chesnutt provided a powerful performance of the 1972 Bobby Russell-penned classic song, "[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]" on Pravda Records' 1994 "Star Power" CD featuring various artists.

Chesnutt sang another, much older, classic song, "[[Home on the Range]]", based on the poem, "The Western Home", written in 1872 by Dr. [[Brewster M. Higley]], on another CD featuring various artists entitled, "Rudy's Rockin' Kiddie Caravan", produced by [[Turner Network Television]].  Proceeds from the sale of the CD went to support the [[National Center for Family Literacy]].

Chesnutt was also a supporter of [[Medical cannabis|medical marijuana]],<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9811/20/hempilation/|title=Singing the praises of pot on 'Hempilation 2'|date=November 20, 1998|publisher=CNN|first=Jamie|last=Allen|access-date= January 6, 2010}}</ref> which he said helped with his medical problems.  He contributed the track, "Weed to the Rescue", to the 1998 ''Hempilation II'' charity album, with proceeds going to [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws|NORML]], an American organization dedicated to marijuana legalization.

Chesnutt wrote and provided vocals on the song, "Aunt Avis" on [[Widespread Panic]]'s 1997 album, ''Bombs & Butterflies'' (a solo demo of Chesnutt performing the song was included as a bonus track on the 2004 re-release of his 1993 album, ''Drunk'').

Chesnutt frequently performed [[Daniel Johnston]]'s song, "Like a Monkey in a Zoo", during live performances. Chesnutt recorded a version of the song that was released on the 2004 compilation CD, ''[[The Late Great Daniel Johnston: Discovered Covered]]''.

He also appeared as a guest musician on [[Cowboy Junkies]]' 2007 album and accompanying DVD ''[[Trinity Revisited]]'', a 20th anniversary remake of the Junkies' classic album ''[[The Trinity Session]]''. In 2011 Cowboy Junkies released ''[[Demons (Cowboy Junkies album)|Demons]]'', an album of eleven Chesnutt covers.

Chesnutt recorded a solo acoustic version of the song, "Little Man", for the CD ''[[Ciao My Shining Star: The Songs of Mark Mulcahy]]'', which was released under the [[Shout! Factory]] label in 2009.

He was 45 years of age.<ref name="nyt_12252009"/> In his final interview, which aired on [[National Public Radio (United States)|National Public Radio]] 24 days before his death, Chesnutt said that he had "attempted suicide three or four times [before]. It didn't take."<ref name=Survival/>

According to him in the same interview, being "uninsurable" due to his quadriplegia, he was $50,000 in debt for his medical bills, and had been putting off a surgery for a year ("And, I mean, I could die only because I cannot afford to go in there again. I don't want to die, especially just because of I don't have enough money to go in the hospital.").<ref name=Survival/>
