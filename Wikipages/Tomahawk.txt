A '''tomahawk''' is a type of single-handed [[axe]] native to the many [[Native Americans in the United States|Indigenous peoples and nations]] of [[North America]], traditionally resembling a [[hatchet]] with a straight shaft.<ref name="PH"/><ref name="SSH"/> The term came into the English language in the 17th century as an [[Anglicisation#Anglicisation of loanwords|adaptation]] of the [[Powhatan]] ([[Virginia]]n [[Eastern Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]) word.

Tomahawks were general-purpose tools used by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and later the European colonials with whom they traded, and often employed as a hand-to-hand weapon. The metal tomahawk heads were originally based on a [[Royal Navy]] boarding axe and used as a trade-item with Native Americans for food and other provisions.<ref name="PH"/><ref name="SSH"/>

==Etymology==
The name comes from [[Powhatan language|Powhatan]] ''tamahaac'', derived from the [[Proto-Algonquian]] root ''*temah-'' "to cut off by tool".<ref name="Cutler 2002 139">{{cite book |last=Cutler |first=Charles L. |title=Tracks that Speak: The Legacy of Native American Words in North American Culture |year=2002 |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] |location=Boston |isbn=0-618-06509-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/tracksthatspeakl00char |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/tracksthatspeakl00char/page/139 139]}}</ref> [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] cognates include [[Lenape language|Lenape]] ''təmahikan'',<ref>{{cite dictionary |title=tëmahikàn |url=http://www.talk-lenape.org/results?query=tëmahikàn&lang=lenape |dictionary=Lenape Talking Dictionary |access-date=October 27, 2012 |quote=The Lenape root ''təmə-'' means 'to cut off' and the suffix -''hikan'' forms the names of tools}}</ref> Malecite-Passamaquoddy ''tomhikon'', and Abenaki ''demahigan'', all of which mean "axe".<ref name="Hranicky2009">{{cite book |last=Hranicky |first=William |title=Material Culture from Prehistoric Virginia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_nBw1BC2JW4C&pg=PA56 |date=1 April 2009 |publisher=[[AuthorHouse]] |isbn=978-1-4389-6661-8 |page=56}}</ref><ref name="JahrBroch1996">{{cite book |last=Jahr |first=Ernst Håkon |author-link=Ernst Håkon Jahr |last2=Broch |first2=Ingvild |title=Language Contact in the Arctic: Northern Pidgins and Contact Languages |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VAfMZIta9yUC&pg=PA295 |year=1996 |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]] |isbn=978-3-11-014335-5 |page=295}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Tomahawk, late 19th-early 20th century, 26.802.jpg|thumbnail|Tomahawk, Oglala, Lakota, Sioux (Native American), late 19th-early 20th century, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
[[File:NezPerce Tomahawk.jpg|thumb|175px|left|[[Nez Perce people|Nez Perce]] tomahawk]]
The [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquians]] in early America created the tomahawk. Before Europeans came to the continent, Native Americans would use stones, sharpened by a process of knapping and pecking,<ref>{{cite web |title=History and Origins of the Tomahawk |url=https://www.camp4.com/history-of-the-tomahawk/ |work=Tomahawk History |access-date=10 June 2021}}</ref> attached to wooden handles, secured with strips of [[Rawhide (material)|rawhide]]. The tomahawk quickly spread from the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian culture]] to the tribes of the South and the Great Plains.

When Europeans arrived, they introduced the metal blade to the natives, which improved the effectiveness of the tool. Metal did not break as readily as stone and could be fashioned for additional uses. Native Americans created a ''tomahawk’s poll'', the side opposite the blade, which consisted of a hammer, spike or a pipe. These became known as pipe tomahawks, which consisted of a bowl on the poll and a hollowed out shaft.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Shannon |first=Timothy J. |year=2005 |title=Queequeg's Tomahawk: A Cultural Biography, 1750-1900 |url=http://cupola.gettysburg.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=histfac |journal=[[Ethnohistory (journal)|Ethnohistory]] |publisher=[[Gettysburg College]] |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=589–633 |doi=10.1215/00141801-52-3-589 |via=The Cupola: Scholarship at Gettysburg College}}</ref> These were created by European and American artisans for trade and diplomatic gifts for the tribes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tomahawk History |url=http://www.hawkthrowing.com/history-of-tomahawks.html |work=Hawk Throwing |access-date=22 July 2014}}</ref>

== Modern use==
Tomahawks are useful in camping and bushcraft scenarios. They are mostly used as an alternative to a hatchet, as they are generally lighter and slimmer than hatchets. They often contain other tools in addition to the axe head, such as spikes or hammers.<ref name="Fadala2006">{{cite book |last=Fadala |first=Sam |title=The Complete Blackpowder Handbook |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dzxyneq43AEC&pg=PA348 |year=2006 |publisher=Gun Digest Books |location=Iola, Wisconsin |isbn=0-89689-390-1 |page=348}}</ref>

The tomahawk competitions have regulations concerning the type and style of tomahawk used for throwing. There are special throwing tomahawks made for these kinds of competitions. Requirements such as a minimum handle length and a maximum blade edge (usually {{cvt|4|in|disp=sqbr}}) are the most common tomahawk throwing competition rules.<ref name=comp/>

Tomahawks were used by individual members of the US Army [[Stryker]] Brigade in Afghanistan, the [[172nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team]] based at [[Grafenwöhr]] (Germany), the 3rd Brigade, [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] out of [[Fort Lewis (Washington)|Fort Lewis]], a reconnaissance platoon in the 2d Squadron 183d Cavalry ([[116th Infantry Brigade Combat Team]]) ([[Operation Iraqi Freedom|OIF]] 2007–2008) and numerous other soldiers.<ref name="wedge"/><ref name="EKI"/> The tomahawk was issued a NATO stock number (4210-01-518-7244) and classified as a "Class 9 rescue kit" as a result of a program called the Rapid Fielding Initiative; it is also included within every [[Stryker]] vehicle as the "modular entry tool set".<ref name="wedge">{{cite journal |last=Steele |first=David E. |title=Wedged Edges at War |journal=[[Blade Magazine]] |date=September 2005 |pages=12–19}}</ref><ref name="EKI"/> This design enjoyed something of a renaissance with US soldiers in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] as a tool and in use in hand-to-hand combat.<ref name="ABC">{{cite news |last=Tillett |first=David |url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=90038&page=1 |title=Lethal Weapon:Historic Tomahawk Returns to the Battlefield with Some U.S. Troops |newspaper=[[ABC News]] |date=April 15, 2003 |access-date=January 24, 2007}}</ref>

===Law enforcement===
The tomahawk has gained some respect from members of various law enforcement tactical (i.e. "SWAT") teams. Some companies have seized upon this new popularity and are producing "tactical tomahawks".  These SWAT-oriented tools are designed to be both useful and relatively light. Some examples of "tactical tomahawks" include models wherein the shaft is designed as a prybar. There are models with line/rope cutting notches, cuts in the head allowing its use as a wrench, and models with broad, heavy heads to assist in breaching doors.<ref name="PH.D.2010">{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Steven J.|title=TAIHO-JUTSU: The Art of Arrests|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rR6PAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT216|date=27 December 2010|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=978-1-4653-2508-2|page=216}}{{self-published source|date=December 2017}}</ref>{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

===Modern tomahawk fighting===
There are not many systems worldwide which teach fighting skills with the axe or a tomahawk to civilians. However one martial art known as Okichitaw teaches tomahawk fighting in conjunction with other indigenous weapons such as the plains dagger, lance and gunstock war club, mostly based on Plains Indian combat principles. In the 21st century, tomahawks have been prominently featured in films and video games (e.g. ''[[The Patriot (2000 film)|The Patriot]]''; ''[[Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter]]'';<ref>{{cite book |last=Grahame-Smith |first=Seth |author-link=Seth Grahame-Smith |title=[[Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter (novel)|Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter]] |publisher=[[Grand Central Publishing]] |date=March 2, 2010 |pages=336 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-446-56308-6 |oclc=458890478}}</ref> ''[[Bullet to the Head]]''; ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]''),<ref>{{cite book |title=Assassin's Creed III - Strategy Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ORDSCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT125 |publisher=Game Guide |date=October 28, 2015 |page=125 |isbn=9781621545316}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Altson |first=John |last2=Lee |first2=Bob |title=The Id from Eden |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IqKEZay_S1wC&pg=PT89 |date=January 29, 2013 |page=89 |isbn=9781482021271}}</ref> leading to increased interest among the public.
