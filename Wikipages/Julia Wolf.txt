'''Julia Wolf''' is a British mathematician specialising in [[arithmetic combinatorics]] who was the 2016 winner of the Anne Bennett Prize of the [[London Mathematical Society]].{{r|bennett|lms}} She is currently university lecturer in the Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics at the [[University of Cambridge]].{{r|cv}}

==Education and career==
Wolf writes that her childhood ambition was to become a [[carpenter]], and that she became attracted to science only after subscribing to ''[[Scientific American]]'' as a teenager.{{r|bristol}}

She read mathematics at [[Clare College, Cambridge]], earning a bachelor's degree there in 2004 and completing the [[Mathematical Tripos]] in 2003.{{r|cv}}
She remained at Cambridge for graduate study, and completed her PhD there in 2008. Her dissertation, ''Arithmetic Structure in Sets of Integers'', was supervised by [[Timothy Gowers]].{{r|cv|mgp}} She was also mentored in her doctoral studies by [[Ben Green (mathematician)|Ben Green]], whom she met when he was a postdoctoral researcher at Cambridge from 2001 to 2005.{{r|green}}

Since earning her doctorate she has been a postdoctoral fellow at the [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute]] in [[Berkeley, California]], Triennial assistant professor at [[Rutgers University]] in [[New Jersey]],
Hadamard associate professor at the [[École Polytechnique]] in [[Paris]] (earning a [[habilitation]] at the [[University of Paris-Sud]] in 2012),
and Heilbronn reader in combinatorics and number theory at the [[University of Bristol]].{{r|cv}} She returned to Cambridge as university lecturer in 2018,{{r|cv|reporter}} and is a Fellow of Clare College.{{r|flare}}

==Recognition==
In 2016 the [[London Mathematical Society]] gave Wolf their [[Anne Bennett Prize]] "in recognition of her outstanding contributions to additive number theory, combinatorics and harmonic analysis and to the mathematical community."{{r|bennett|lms}} The award citation particularly cited her work with Gowers on counting solutions to [[System of linear equations|systems of linear equations]] over [[abelian group]]s, and her work on quadratic analogues of the [[Hard-core predicate|Goldreich–Levin theorem]].{{r|lms}}
