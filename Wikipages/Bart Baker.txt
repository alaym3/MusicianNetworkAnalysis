Besides being active on YouTube, where he has more than 10 million subscribers, (after leaving YouTube, his subscriber count fell back down to 9.95 Million Subscribers),<ref name="socialblade.com">{{Cite web|url=https://socialblade.com/youtube/c/bartbakerofficial|title=bartbakerofficial YouTube Stats, Channel Statistics - Socialblade.com|website=socialblade.com|access-date=2018-03-12}}</ref> Baker is known for his short videos on Vine and also Live.ly, where he was once a top-earning broadcaster.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.my/vine-versus-lively-stars-2016-11/?r=US&IR=T#r3Qd0UISDfibwK2o.97|title=Move over, Vine — people are raking in thousands of dollars a week on a new video app - Business Insider|last=Robinson|first=Melia|date=2016-12-02|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-02-26|language=en-US}}</ref> His videos have been described as 'high-quality parodies that keep to the originals very well'. In 2018,  Baker was signed to [[World Star Hip Hop]] and released a song called "Popper" under the stage name of Lil Kloroxxx and started a life as a rapper.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/1727240/all-about-that-bass-parody-calls-out-meghan-trainor/|title='All About That Bass' Parody Calls Out Meghan Trainor|last=Fears|first=Niki|date=4 January 2015|work=The Inquisitr News|access-date=2017-02-26|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Baker was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] on May 5, 1986. He attended high school at [[New Trier High School]] and film school at the [[University of Miami]]. After realizing the potential of video sharing on the internet, he started filming comedy videos in his backyard on a green screen. [[The Lonely Island|Lonely Island]] was described as a 'big inspiration' to Baker when he first started.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-varrati/youtubes-parody-king_b_4123963.html|title=YouTube's Parody King: An Interview With Bart Baker|last=Varrati|first=Michael|date=2013-10-21|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-02-26}}</ref> He is of English descent.

== YouTube career ==
Baker was encouraged when the first video he posted on YouTube, "Look into My Eyes While I Masturbate", about men masturbating in a future world where robots have replaced all women on Earth, quickly received about 100,000 views.  This prompted Baker to decide on making more videos.<ref name=":3" /> His second video was a parody. He has said, "I figured if I could do it right, my videos could do amazingly well... people want to subscribe to a channel they know has a certain programming structure. Mine is parody videos, and people love that".<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/shira-lazar/1-million-sub-star-youtub_b_3605804.html|title=1 Million Sub Star: YouTuber Bart Baker On Creating Successful Music Parodies (WATCH)|last=Lazar|first=Shira|date=2013-07-16|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-02-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/104681/a-man-in-drag-parodies-adele%E2%80%99s-hello-video-youtube-25|title=Adele's 'Hello' Like You've Never Heard It Before|last=Chew|first=Cohan|date=21 December 2015|website=gigwise.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-26}}</ref> 
Baker worked with his friend Austin Smith from the channel's launch until early 2011, when the duo mutually decided to part ways. During his time with Smith, they were signed by RKShorts.com, who acted as their sponsor. While with RKShorts, Baker gained popularity on YouTube when he began using elderly men in his videos. Parodies of "Baby" & "Love the Way You Lie" were released during that year's summer and were major hits for his channel, especially for an adolescent audience. When Baker left RKShorts in 2011, he stopped using these old men.

Not long after leaving RKShorts, Baker signed on with Maker Studios in Los Angeles and began recording with them.

In 2013, Baker's parody of "[[Royals (song)|Royals]]" by [[Lorde]] was taken down by [[Matt Pincus]], CEO of [[Songs Music Publishing]], for alleged copyright infringement.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2013/12/songs-music-ceo-matt-pincus-responds-to-bart-bakerlorde-controversy-in-heated-twitter-exchange-with-fullscreen-ceo/|title=Songs Music CEO Comments on Bart Baker/Lorde Controversy in Heated Twitter Exchange With Fullscreen CEO - New Media Rockstars|last=Van|first=Alan|date=2013-12-07|work=New Media Rockstars|access-date=2017-02-26|language=en-US}}</ref> Baker quickly posted a video accusing Songs Music of not understanding US laws governing fair use and encouraging fans to tweet about it.  A few days later, Songs Music released their take-down and the parody was restored to Baker's channel.

It was reported on 26 November 2014 that Baker had reached one billion views in total on YouTube.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.craveonline.com/site/793653-bart-baker-reaches-1-billion-views-youtube|title=Bart Baker Reaches 1 Billion Views on YouTube - CraveOnline|last=Longfellow|first=Richard T.|date=2014-11-26|work=CraveOnline|access-date=2017-02-26|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Musical career ==
In November 2016, Baker released his first non-parody single, titled "Drake".<ref name=":1" />''''' '''''It is also the debut single from his first album, titled ''Celebritease''. He partnered with Music Choice, a multi-platform video and music network, to serve as the exclusive TV distribution partner for his single.<ref name=":1" /> The next month, "Kimye", was released as a single from "Celebritease".<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2016/12/prweb13913712.htm|title=Renowned Parody and Digital Artist Bart Baker Releases New Song KIMYE From His Upcoming Album Due Out Early 2017|last=Paganuzzi|first=Josefa|date=9 December 2016|work=PRWeb|access-date=2017-02-26}}</ref> The album was subsequently released through his own record label alongside indie label 26 Music, a division of 26 Entertainment.<ref name=":1" /> The songs featured on the album are all named after celebrities except the final track, "#DWBD (Don't Worry Bout Dat)". On March 18, 2017, the album peaked at number 4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Comedy Albums]] chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/bart-baker|title=Bart Baker Chart History|access-date=2018-07-27}}</ref>

In summer of 2018, Baker created an official rap persona known as Lil Kloroxxx. The video for his song "Popper" was released on the [[WorldStarHipHop]] YouTube channel on July 21. He then went on to release two more songs nearly a month later, "4 Xanny" and "Prom Queen". Online sources have said that Lil Kloroxxx is fake and heavily spoofs off of SoundCloud rappers such as [[6ix9ine]] and [[Lil Pump]], but Baker himself has confirmed that this persona is "real".

== Post-YouTube career ==
In 2016, Baker announced he was running for [[President of the United States]] by setting up a large billboard in [[Times Square]], dressed in American-flag boxer-shorts.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mnewlands/2016/03/04/bart-baker-youtube-star-and-entrepreneur-galvanizes-fans-to-engage-in-voting/#630d325f32b2|title=Bart Baker, YouTube Star And Entrepreneur, Galvanizes Fans To Engage In Voting|last=Newlands|first=Murray|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-02-26}}</ref> He believed that his presidential candidacy would shed light on the nature of celebrity and how it has influenced the election cycle.<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/a-and-e/music/youtube-superstar-bart-baker-announces-presidential-campaign/article/458037|title=YouTube superstar Bart Baker announces presidential campaign|last=Papadatos|first=Markos|date=2016-02-19|work=Digital Journal|access-date=2017-02-26}}</ref>

On September 6, 2019, ''[[Vice News]]'' reported that after YouTube's demonetization of several YouTubers to satisfy family-friendly advertisers, Baker shifted his career to the Chinese market. His works consist of translating and singing Chinese songs on the social media app [[Kuaishou|Kwai]], and his English covers of Chinese songs have been gaining a following on [[Douyin]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Bart Baker Quit YouTube — Now He's Trying To Get Big on the Chinese Internet|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ3RbDTc_fY|language=en|access-date=2019-09-06}}</ref> He moved to Shanghai to further develop his career as an internet content creator in China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chinafilminsider.com/headlines-from-china-is-chinese-social-media-becoming-a-better-place-for-youtubers-to-thrive/|title=Headlines from China: Is Chinese Social Media Becoming A Better Place for YouTubers to Thrive?|date=2019-09-27|website=China Film Insider|access-date=2019-10-19}}</ref>

Since Baker had moved to the Chinese market following the drastic change of YouTube's policies to satisfy family-friendly advertisers, his channel has reached the end of his subscriber peak, as his number of subscribers had dropped from 10 to 9.96 million (as of October 9, 2021).<ref name="socialblade.com" />

On August 29, 2021, Baker uploaded his first YouTube video in over 3 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://youtube.com/ytMfb1eojx4|title=WTF HAPPENED TO ME? (WHY I DISAPEARED)|website=YouTube}}</ref> He announced that he would be traveling to the United States in Fall 2021, and added that he would be able to afford making new content, including occasional parodies, using [[cryptocurrency]].

== Philanthropy ==
In a 2015 livestream podcast, Baker discussed his involvement with "Fuck Cancer", a nonprofit charity that is dedicated to early detection, prevention, and providing support to those affected by cancer, and an online fundraiser where fans could participate to win an appearance in one of his videos while donating money to the cause. The disease has impacted people in his own life including his mother, who survived breast cancer when he was a child.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/shira-lazar/the-secret-to-ridiculous_b_8000602.html|title=The Secret to Ridiculous Humor With YouTube Parody Star Bart Baker|last=Lazar|first=Shira|date=2015-08-17|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-02-26}}</ref>
