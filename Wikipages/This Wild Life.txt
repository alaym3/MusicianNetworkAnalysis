==History==
Formed in December 2010, This Wild Life began as a [[pop punk]] band with former members of the band The Messenger, which disbanded in July 2010.  On May 7, 2013, it was announced that they would be recording with [[Copeland (band)|Copeland]]’s [[Aaron Marsh]].<ref>{{cite web|title=AbsolutePunk.net - Facebook page|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151472593242858&set=a.10150118685907858.286229.8672582857&type=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Fuse TV|url=http://www.fuse.tv/2014/05/this-wild-life-clouded-album-stream-exclusive}}</ref> The change from a full band to an acoustic duo was because there was more attention to their acoustic songs, and acoustic songs are easier on Kevin Jordan's vocals.

===''Petaluma''===
On May 2, 2018 This Wild Life and both band members Kevin Jordan and Anthony Del Grosso announced on their social media accounts that they will be releasing a new album titled ''Petaluma''. Kevin Jordan has said that "this album is the first record we made with a clear vision before the first song was ever written. Something with the dynamics and emotion we've always strived for, but within the bounds of a bright, warm, and organic sonic energy flowing through it." Along with the announcement of the release of the new album, This Wild Life also released a single called "Westside". Kevin Jordan stated that "'Westside' is a song I've wanted to write for many years but never knew how, since its inspiration isn't my story to tell. Sexual assault isn't something many people are comfortable talking about, and my perspective in the song is from a person supporting a loved one who's experienced it." ''Petaluma'' was released on June 22, 2018 in both the United States and Europe.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://distortedsoundmag.com/this-wild-life-announce-new-album-petaluma/|title=This Wild Life announce new album 'Petaluma' - Distorted Sound Magazine|date=2018-05-02|work=Distorted Sound Magazine|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}</ref>
