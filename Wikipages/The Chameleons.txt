'''The Chameleons''' are an English [[post-punk]] band formed in [[Middleton, Greater Manchester|Middleton]], [[Greater Manchester]], England, in 1981. The band consisted of singer and bassist [[Mark Burgess (musician)|Mark Burgess]], guitarists Reg Smithies and Dave Fielding, and drummer John Lever. 

The band released their debut album, ''[[Script of the Bridge]]'', in 1983. They followed it with ''[[What Does Anything Mean? Basically]]'' and ''[[Strange Times (The Chameleons album)|Strange Times]]'' in 1985 and 1986, respectively, before abruptly disbanding in 1987 due to the sudden death of the band's manager. After the split, Burgess and Lever formed The Sun And The Moon, while Fielding and Smithies formed the Reegs. Burgess also had a short solo career with backing band the Sons of God.

The Chameleons reformed in 2000, releasing the albums ''[[Strip (The Chameleons album)|Strip]]'' (2000), ''[[Why Call It Anything]]'' (2001), and ''[[This Never Ending Now]]'' (2002). Renewed tensions caused the group to separate again in 2003. Burgess alone continues to play Chameleons songs live under the name ChameleonsVox. Lever died in 2017.  

Known for their atmospheric, guitar-based sound, the Chameleons are regarded as one of the most underrated Manchester bands of the 1980s.<ref name=rc/><ref name=rg2003/> They did not attain the commercial success of other groups from the Manchester scene but developed a [[cult following]].<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.scmp.com/culture/music/article/2126777/post-punk-band-chameleons-singer-their-hong-kong-debut-37-years-after|title =Post-punk band The Chameleons’ singer on their Hong Kong debut, 37 years after they started out|website =South China Morning Post|first =Lauren|last =James|date =4 January 2018}}</ref>

==History==
===Early career===
The Chameleons were formed in [[Middleton, Greater Manchester|Middleton]], [[Greater Manchester]], England in 1981 by [[Mark Burgess (musician)|Mark Burgess]], Reg Smithies and Dave Fielding. Burgess previously played with the Cliches, while Smithies and Fielding had performed with Years. They started as a trio—Burgess as vocalist and bassist, Smithies and Fielding both on guitar—without a drummer. They later recruited fellow Middletonian Brian Schofield, who was soon replaced by [[Dukinfield]]-based John Lever, previously of the Politicians. Former [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]] drummer Martin Jackson briefly replaced Lever during 1982–83 while the latter was on sabbatical.<ref name=rc/><ref name=ge2006>{{cite book|title =New wave: la prima e più completa guida sul genere che ha sovvertito le regole della musica|language =it|first1 =Alessandro|last1 =Bonini|first2 =Emanuele|last2 =Tamagnini|publisher =Gremese|date =2006|page =96}}</ref> The band were then inspired by [[U2]]'s early recordings : "U2's [[Boy (album)|first record]] was a big album for us. [[The Edge|Edge]]'s guitar opened it up in terms of how you could build an ambient atmosphere".<ref name=independentie>{{cite web|url =https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/the-chameleons-the-band-that-refused-to-blend-in-29796330.html|title =The Chameleons: The band that refused to blend in [Mark Burgess interview]|first =Ed|last =Power|website =The Independent|date =1 December 2013}}</ref>

After performing several radio sessions for [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[John Peel]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blocksidge |first1=David |last2=Clarey |first2=Tina |date=1 June 1984 |title=The Chameleons |magazine=[[City Fun]] |url=http://www.thechameleons.com/press/index.php?article=7 |access-date=15 July 2013}}</ref> - the first session was recorded in June 1981,<ref>"The Chameleons ''John Peel Sessions'' [liner notes (vinyl LP)]". [[Strange Fruit Records|Strange Fruit]] label. SFRLP114. 1980.</ref> the band were signed to [[Epic Records]], which was then a subsidiary of [[CBS Records International]]. Their debut single "In Shreds" released in March 1982, <ref name=cl2011>{{cite book|title =The Encyclopedia of Popular Music|first =Colin |last =Larkin|publisher =Omnibus Press|date =2011|pages =49–50}}</ref> was produced by [[Steve Lillywhite]].<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web |url =https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-chameleons-uk-mn0001557918/biography|title=The Chameleons UK <nowiki>| Music Biography, Credits and Discography |</nowiki> AllMusic |last =Ankeny |first =Jason |website =[[AllMusic]] |access-date =15 July 2013}}</ref> The single's cover – a harrowing painting by Smithies, who created the artwork for all of their releases – mirrored the band's tense, atmospheric sound.<ref name=rg2003/> During this time, the Chameleons' independent style clashed with their label's visions for the band. Wary of the loss of credibility [[Altered Images]] had suffered due to buckling to CBS' demands on packaging, the Chameleons were protective of their image and consequently were dropped by the label soon after the release of "In Shreds".<ref name=rc/>

The Chameleons subsequently signed to UK label Statik Records, a subsidiary of [[Virgin Records]], on which they released their debut studio album, ''[[Script of the Bridge]]'', in 1983.<ref name=ge2006/> ''Script of the Bridge'', featuring the singles "Up the Down Escalator", "As High as You Can Go" and "A Person Isn't Safe Anywhere These Days", showcased Burgess's strong vocals and the band's guitar-based sound, with careful use of [[synthesisers]].<ref name=rg2003/> Upon its release, the UK press said that the artwork looked like a "seventies [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] style drawing rather unhappily adorning the sleeve".<ref name=sounds>{{cite journal |last=Linfield |first=Carole |date=1 August 1983 |title=''Script of the Bridge''***¾ |magazine=[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]}}</ref> A ''[[NME]]'' concert review  described their music as "guitars slipping and sliding on slopes of echo, snapping their wires, fussing and fretting over stampeding drums, getting angry and staccato and falling to harmonic whispers". Concerning the guitar playing, it was said that there was an influence of U2 and [[Echo & the Bunnymen]].<ref>Bartle, Bart. "The Chameleons - Hudersfield Polytechnic [live review]". ''NME''. 16 July 1983.</ref> 

Statik's status as a subsidiary of Virgin prevented the band from qualifying for the [[UK Independent Singles and Albums Charts|independent charts]], which resulted in reduced coverage by the British music press.<ref name=band/> [[MCA Records]] released the album in the United States in an abridged form, minus four songs, which angered the band.<ref name=band>{{cite web|url =http://www.thechameleons.com/band/|title =The Chameleons|date =12 December 2014|website =TheChameleons.com}}</ref> However, the US release and a 1984 American tour did earn them significant [[college radio]] airplay and a loyal fanbase.<ref>{{cite web|url =https://thedumbingofamerica.wordpress.com/2009/03/29/history-lesson-the-chameleons-and-the-great-mark-burgess/|title =History Lesson: The Chameleons and the great Mark Burgess|author =toddc2001|website =The Dumbing Of America|date =29 March 2009}}</ref> 

Their second studio album, ''[[What Does Anything Mean? Basically]]'', was released in 1985 by Statik, which also reissued "In Shreds" and its [[B-side]] "Less Than Human" as the 12" ''Nostalgia'' EP, adding the previously unreleased track "Nostalgia".<ref>{{cite book|title =View From a Hill|first =Mark|last =Burgess|publisher =Metropolitan Press|date =2010}}</ref>{{page needed|date=April 2018}} ''Basically'' established the band as a promising, guitar-based group.<ref name=cl2011/>

Regular touring after the release of ''Basically'',<ref name=cl2011/> along with efforts by the band's manager, Tony Fletcher, persuaded [[David Geffen]] to sign the band to [[Geffen Records]], which released their third studio album, ''[[Strange Times (The Chameleons album)|Strange Times]]'', in 1986.<ref name=ge2006/> A dark, complex work,<ref name=allmusic/> it contained the singles "Tears" and "Swamp Thing",<ref name=rg2003/> but proved to be their final record of the period.<ref name=allmusic/> A rift existed within the band, particularly between Burgess and Fielding,<ref name=graff>{{cite book|title =MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide|first =Gary|last =Graff|publisher =Visible Ink Press|date =1996|page =129}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.sicmagazine.net/4449/draft-interview-mark-burgess-the-chameleons/|title =Interview – Mark Burgess, The Chameleons|first =Brett|last =Spaceman|website =[sic] Magazine|date =24 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url =http://louderthanwar.com/interview-mark-burgess-talks-in-depth-on-the-chameleons-and-this-weekends-home-shows/|title =Mark Burgess talks in depth on the Chameleons and this weekends home shows|first =John|last =Robb|website =Louder Than War|date =15 December 2015}}</ref> and Fletcher's sudden death in 1987 due to [[cardiac arrest]] led to the group disbanding.<ref name=ge2006/><ref name=allmusic/>

===Post-breakup===
After the breakup, numerous spin-off bands emerged,<ref name=cl2011/> none of which achieved much success.<ref name=rg2003/> Burgess and Lever formed the Sun and the Moon, recruiting Andy Whitaker and Andy Clegg to replace Smithies and Fielding. They released [[The Sun and the Moon (The Sun and the Moon album)|an eponymous studio album]] on Geffen in 1988, but separated the next year. Burgess then embarked on a solo career, while the remaining members briefly continued on as Weaveworld.<ref name=kellman>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/sun-the-moon-mn0001527804 |title=Sun & the Moon <nowiki>| Music Biography |</nowiki> AllMusic |first=Andy |last=Kellman |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=6 February 2014}}</ref> Smithies and Fielding formed the Reegs with the help of vocalist Gary Lavery and a drum machine,<ref name=rg2003/><ref name=reegs/> and released two albums, ''Return of the Sea Monkeys'' (1991) and ''Rock the Magic Rock'' (1992), on the independent label [[Imaginary Records]].<ref name=reegs>{{cite web|url =https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-reegs-mn0001843293/biography|title =The Reegs <nowiki>| Biography & History |</nowiki> AllMusic |author =|website =[[AllMusic]] |access-date =1 April 2018}}</ref>

Burgess released his debut solo album, ''Zima Junction'', in 1993, and toured America the following year with his backing band the Sons of God.<ref name=allmusic/> He released another studio album, ''Spring Blooms Tra-La'' (1994), as well as a live album, ''Manchester 93'' (1994), before partnering with [[Yves Altana]] in 1995, releasing ''Paradyning'' the same year.<ref name=rg2003/> Afterwards, he founded Invincible with Altana and drummer Geoff Walker. They self-released their debut album, ''Venus'', in 1999, with most sales being digital.<ref>{{cite web|url =https://www.allmusic.com/artist/invincible-mn0001607388|title =Invincible <nowiki>| Biography & History |</nowiki> AllMusic|first =Michael|last =Sutton|website =AllMusic|access-date =1 April 2018}}</ref> He also worked with Bird, the Messengers and [[Black Swan Lane]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Lever later joined Bushart, who released the album ''Yesterday Is History'' (2008).

In 1990, the Chameleons posthumously released an [[extended play|EP]], ''[[Tony Fletcher Walked on Water.... La La La La La-La La-La-La]]'', with the title paying tribute to their former manager. They also issued numerous live albums and compilations.<ref name=graff/>

===Reformation===

The Chameleons reconvened in January 2000 to prepare for a series of concerts in [[The Witchwood]], [[Ashton-under-Lyne]], one of the band's favourite venues, in May.<ref name=rg2003/><ref name=allmusic/> May 2000 also saw the release of the album ''[[Strip (The Chameleons album)|Strip]]'', which featured old material in an acoustic format.<ref name=cl2011/><ref name=allmusic/> The concerts were a success,<ref name=rg2003/> and they expanded the reunion tour to include European dates in the summer and two California dates that fall.<ref name=allmusic/> They released a new studio album, ''[[Why Call It Anything]]'', in 2001, followed by another unplugged album, ''[[This Never Ending Now]]'', in 2002 and a full American tour.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.incendiarymag.com/letterfromlondon/thechameleons/letter_oldham_and_arnsberg_last_days_chameleons%E2%80%8F|title =LETTER FROM OLDHAM (AND ARNSBERG) - THE LAST DAYS OF THE CHAMELEONS|first =Cath|last =Aubergine|website =Incendiary Magazine|date =20 November 2012}}</ref> Renewed tensions led to the band dissolving once again in early 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thechameleons.com/news/index.php?newsitem=43 |title=The Chameleons – News |website=The Chameleons |access-date=15 July 2013}}</ref>

In 2009, Burgess and Lever reformed to play Chameleons back catalogue material, under the name ChameleonsVox. They issued an EP, ''M+D=1(8)'', in November 2013. In addition to Burgess and Lever, ChameleonsVox line-ups have included guitarists [[Roger Lavallee]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://agitreader.com/wp2/chameleonsvox-the-wick-brooklyn-october-8/ |title=ChameleonsVox The Wick, Brooklyn, October 8 |publisher=The Agit Reader |date=14 October 2015 |access-date=13 March 2017}}</ref> Justin Lomery, Andrew Abernathy, Neil Dwerryhouse and Chris Oliver; bassists Frank Deserto and Jessica Espeleta; and drummers Glenn Maryansky, Yves Altana and Stephen Rice.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://blog.kexp.org/2010/09/24/live-video-the-chameleons-vox/|title =The Chameleons Vox|publisher =KEXP-FM|first =Jim|last =Beckmann|date =24 September 2010}}</ref>  Lever later went on to leave the band.

In 2014, Lever and Fielding reunited to record an album, ''Endless Sea'', as Red-Sided Garter Snakes. The album, featuring contributions from vocalist James Mudriczki of [[Puressence]] and Clegg, was released in July 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Red Sided Garter Snakes - Endless Sea|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/release/endless-sea-mr0004439769|website=Allmusic|access-date=31 July 2016}}</ref>

Lever died on 13 March 2017, following a short illness, at the age of 55.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.post-punk.com/the-chameleons-john-lever-has-passed-away/ |title=The Chameleons’ John Lever has passed away|website=Post-punk.com |access-date=14 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url =https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/mar/14/john-lever-chameleons-drummer-dies|title =John Lever, Chameleons drummer, dies|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|author =|date =14 March 2017}}</ref>

==Musical style==
During the Chameleons' early career, the British music press often used terms such as "sonic architects" and "sonic cathedrals" when describing the band, due to their atmospheric sound.<ref name=graff/><ref name=independentie /> Smithies and Fielding provided shimmering guitar riffs,<ref name=rc>{{cite magazine|title =The Chameleons: Mark Hodgkinson recalls one of the unheralded prophets of the Manchester scene|magazine =Record Collector|first =Mark|last =Hodgkinson}}</ref> while Lever and Burgess on drums and bass, respectively, gave the band a solid, rhythmic foundation.<ref name=quietus>{{cite web|url =http://thequietus.com/articles/14938-the-chameleons-vox-mark-burgess-interview|title =Vox Pop: Mark Burgess Of The Chameleons Interviewed|first =Julian|last =Marszaiek|website =The Quietus|date =23 April 2014}}</ref>

The Chameleons emerged as [[Thatcherism]] was beginning to have its effect on England's former industrial towns, and their music was imbued with a sense of anxiety and a longing for the security of innocence.<ref name=rg2003>{{cite book|title =The Rough Guide to Rock|first =Peter|last =Buckley|date =2003|publisher =Rough Guides|pages =182–183}}</ref> Burgess's impassioned vocal delivery<ref name=rc/> complemented his lyrics, which touched on the alienation created in many British communities by the decline of manufacturing and industry, and the consequent disruption of social order.<ref name=quietus/> Despite the bleak landscapes they were surrounded by, the band were not weighed down by their environment, but attempted to triumph over it.<ref name=graff/> Burgess said in 2013 that, though growing up in a post-industrial, [[Northern England|northern]] town must have some influence on one's music, he felt the Chameleons would have sounded similar regardless of where they originated from.<ref name=independentie/>
