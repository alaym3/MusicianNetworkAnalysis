While studying [[ethnomusicology]] at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], Mulvey met the other members of Portico Quartet. The band consisted of Cambridge school friend Duncan Bellamy (drums), Jack Wyllie (soprano and tenor saxophone), and Milo Fitzpatrick (double bass). Their debut album ''Knee-deep in the North Sea'', was nominated for the 2008 Mercury Prize<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/22/mercury.music.prize.2008.nominations|title=Mercury Music Prize 2008 nominations announced|first=Rosie|last=Swash|date=22 July 2008|accessdate=11 October 2017|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref> alongside [[Radiohead]], [[Elbow (band)|Elbow]], and [[Adele]]. The album's title was mentioned in the closing words to Alt-J's song ''Dissolve Me''. Portico Quartet released their second album ''Isla'' on 9 October 2009 through [[Real World Records]].

==Solo career==
Mulvey left Portico Quartet in 2011 to focus on a solo career as a singer-songwriter. Some critics noted his change in style,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/08/nick-mulvey-first-mind-review|title=Nick Mulvey: First Mind review – Portico Quartet wok-beater turns troubadour|first=Dave|last=Simpson|date=8 May 2014|accessdate=11 October 2017|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref> Mulvey states that his style of music stays consistent. "I'm always drawn to the same principles in music. Beneath each genre, at a certain level, they hold the same principles".

As a solo artist, Mulvey released his first EP ''The Trellis'' in November 2012, and his second, ''Fever to the Form'' in July 2013. On his autumn 2013 tour with [[Laura Marling]], he performed in symphony halls across the UK, naming Marling as a great influence to his solo music.

In 2014, Mulvey played [[Wonderfruit]] in Thailand.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.residentadvisor.net/news.aspx?id=25952|title=Wonderfruit Festival launches in Thailand with Seth Troxler|website=Resident Advisor|accessdate=11 October 2017}}</ref>

On 16 May 2017, Mulvey announced a new track, ''Unconditional'', and on 20 May 2017 announced the album ''Wake Up Now'', to be released on 8 September 2017. Two further singles were released: ''Myela'' (about the [[European migrant crisis]]) and ''Mountain to Move''.<ref name="auto"/>
