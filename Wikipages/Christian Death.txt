'''Christian Death''' is an American [[gothic rock]] band formed in [[Los Angeles County, California]], in 1979 by [[Rozz Williams]]. With major line-up changes over the years, Christian Death has retained "a relentlessly confrontational stand against [[organized religion]] and conventional morality".<ref name="Huey">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/christian-death-mn0000120060/biography |title=Christian Death – Music Biography, Credits and Discography |last=Huey |first=Steve |website=[[AllMusic]] |publisher=[[AllRovi]] |access-date=June 26, 2013}}</ref>

Williams was eventually joined by guitarist [[Rikk Agnew]] of the band [[Adolescents (band)|Adolescents]], James McGearty on bass guitar and George Belanger on drums. This line-up was responsible for producing the band's best known work, their 1982 debut album ''[[Only Theatre of Pain]]'', which was highly influential in the development of the style of music known as [[deathrock]], as well as on the American [[Gothic rock|gothic]] scene which also produced bands such as [[Kommunity FK]] and [[45 Grave]].<ref name="Huey"/>

Following the release of ''Only Theatre of Pain'', Christian Death's line-up had fallen apart, and by the time of the band's second album, ''[[Catastrophe Ballet]]'' (1984), Rozz was joined by [[Valor Kand]] of tour mates [[Pompeii 99]] on vocals and guitar. Following the release of the band's third album, ''Ashes'', in 1985, Williams left the band and was controversially replaced by Valor as frontperson of the band, with no original members of the band remaining, causing a divide in the band's fanbase that has continued to this day.<ref name="Huey"/>

==History==
===Formation and Rozz Williams years (1979–1985)===
Christian Death was founded by a teenage [[Rozz Williams]] in [[Los Angeles]], California in October 1979.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Christian Death |year=1982 |publisher=[[Frontier Records]] |location=Box 22, Sun Valley, [[California]], 91352 |url=http://thebluehour.free.fr/Frontierrelease.jpg |access-date=June 9, 2013}}</ref> Williams grew up in the eastern suburb of [[Pomona, California|Pomona]] in a Christian family. Williams had originally called his band the Upsetters, which included guitarist Jay (a.k.a. John Albert), bassist James McGearty and drummer George Belanger. The band garnered attention after changing their name to Christian Death and adding former [[Adolescents (band)|Adolescents]] guitarist [[Rikk Agnew]]. In 1981, they made their first vinyl appearance with the song "Dogs" on the L.A. scene compilation album ''[[Hell Comes to Your House]]''.<ref name="Huey"/>

In 1982, Christian Death signed to [[Frontier Records]], and released their debut album, ''[[Only Theatre of Pain]]'' that March.<ref name="Huey"/> ''Only Theatre of Pain'' was released in Europe by the French label L'Invitation au Suicide, followed by the record's release in [[Japan]].

Christian Death broke up amid band infighting and drug abuse. Williams assembled a new version of the band in 1983 by merging with another L.A. rock band, [[Pompeii 99]]. This lineup included guitarist [[Valor Kand]], vocalist and keyboardist [[Gitane Demone]], and drummer David Glass. The new version of the band recorded their next two albums, 1984's ''[[Catastrophe Ballet]]'' (with bassist Constance Smith) and 1985's ''Ashes'' (with bassist Randy Wilde).<ref name="Huey"/>

===Valor Kand era (1985–present)===
[[Image:2014 WGT 14 Christian Death.jpg|thumb|Christian Death performing live at [[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]] in Leipzig, Germany, in 2014]]In mid-1985, Williams left Christian Death, in part due to his increasing interest in experimental music and performance art. Kand took over leadership, serving as lead singer and songwriter. Augmented by bassist Johann Schumann and guitarist and keyboardist Barry Galvin, the band recorded an EP for the Italian label Supporti Fonografici titled ''The Wind Kissed Pictures'', credited to "For Sin And Sacrifice Must We Die A Christian Death". The EP was later reissued in Germany and the U.S., credited to Christian Death.<ref name="Huey"/>

Their first post-Williams album was 1986's ''Atrocities'', a concept album about the aftereffects of [[World War II]] on the European psyche, which was followed by 1987's ''The Scriptures'', recorded by a revamped lineup of Kand, Demone, Glass, guitarist James Beam and bassist Kota. Longtime drummer Glass left the group following the release of ''The Scriptures'' and returned to California, where he eventually worked with several Williams side projects.<ref name="Huey"/>

The band had their biggest successes on the [[UK Independent Singles and Albums Charts|UK Independent Chart]] with the 1987–89 singles "Sick of Love", "Church of No Return" and "Zero Sex" and the 1988 album ''Sex and Drugs and Jesus Christ''. Following the "Zero Sex" single, Demone opted to leave the band.

Valor recorded the two-part ''All the Love All the Hate'' [[concept album]] (1989) in collaboration with Nick the Bastard, which spawned the double [[A-side]] single "We Fall Like Love"/"I Hate You".

During the late 1980s, while also recording as [[Shadow Project]], Williams resurrected his own version of Christian Death, with his wife [[Eva O]] contributing guitar as well as vocals. Billing themselves as the original Christian Death, they were rejoined by first-album guitarist Agnew for a 1989 tour of Canada. The band was signed to [[Cleopatra Records]], and released ''The Iron Mask'' album and ''Skeleton Kiss'' EP in 1992. Williams' reclamation of the Christian Death name sparked a fierce battle with Kand. However, Kand already had the rights to the name due to Williams' departure from the band and subsequent neglect of the moniker.<ref>{{citation |url=http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/dc9/2013/09/valor_kand_of_christian_death.php|title=Valor Kand of Christian Death|access-date=20 October 2015}}</ref> Williams consequently billed his version of the band as "Christian Death Featuring Rozz Williams". After this, Williams' version released ''The Path of Sorrows'' album in 1993 and ''The Rage of Angels'' in 1994. A 1993 show featuring ''Only Theatre of Pain''-era members Williams, Agnew and Belanger (along with bassist [[Casey Chaos]]) performing live at [[Los Angeles]]' Patriot Hall was recorded and later released in 2001 as a [[DVD]] by Cleopatra.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Live-Christian-Death/dp/B00005RDSH |title=Amazon.com: Live: Christian Death: Movies & TV |website=[[Amazon.com]] |access-date=June 26, 2013}}</ref> Williams pursued other projects<ref name="Huey"/> before committing suicide on April 1, 1998.

Meanwhile, Kand's Christian Death continued performing and recording, issuing the 1990 album ''Insanus, Ultio, Proditio, Misercordiaque'', on which Kand conducted the English Abbey Choir and the Commonwealth Chamber Orchestra.<ref>See the booklet which accompanies ''Insanus, Ultio, Proditio, Misercordiaque''</ref> The band added bassist [[Maitri (musician)|Maitri]] in 1991. Her first concert with Christian Death took place at the Contemporary Festival, held at the Anfitheatro delle Cascine in [[Florence]], Italy on 12 July 1991. The band released the ''Sexy Death God'' album in 1994, the double-live set ''Amen'' in 1995, the Nostradamus-themed ''Prophecies'' in 1996, and ''Pornographic Messiah'' in 1998.

In 2000, Christian Death added drummer Will Sarginson and toured Europe with Britain's [[Cradle of Filth]] in support of the ''Born Again Anti Christian'' album.

Kand and Maitri also formed another band, [[black metal]]/[[Death rock|deathrock]] act [[Lover of Sin]], releasing the album ''Christian Death Presents Lover of Sin'' in 2002.

For Christian Death's 2003 tour, they were augmented by Cradle of Filth guitarist Gian Pyres.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.facebook.com/christiandeath?v=info&expand=1 |title=Security Check |publisher=M.facebook.com |access-date=2016-09-07}}</ref>

Christian Death released ''[[American Inquisition]]'' in 2007, featuring new drummer Nate Hassan.<ref name="Huey"/>

In 2014, the band embarked on the 30th Anniversary Catastrophe Ballet tour, beginning in Europe and continuing through the year's end in North, South and Central America.

In January 2015, Christian Death announced the planned release of the [[PledgeMusic]] funded album, ''The Root of All Evilution''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://louderthanwar.com/christian-death-announce-new-pledgemusic-album-the-root-of-all-evilution-check-out-the-pledge-extras |title=Christian Death announce new Pledge Music album 'The Root OF ALL Evilution' – check out the Pledge extras!! |publisher=Louder Than War |date=2015-01-14 |access-date=2016-09-07}}</ref> The album was digitally released on August 14, 2015, by Knife Fight Media, and on vinyl on October 16, 2015, by [[Season of Mist]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.season-of-mist.com/bands/christian-death |title=Christian Death, The Root of All Evilution album, Gothic (news, biography, releases, downloads, line-up, tour dates) &#124; Season of Mist, Metal Label |publisher=Season-of-mist.com |access-date=2016-09-07}}</ref><ref name="theomegaorder1">{{cite web|url=http://www.theomegaorder.com/CHRISTIAN-DEATH-The-Root-Of-All-Evilution-Digipack |title=CHRISTIAN DEATH – The Root Of All Evilution (Digipack) |publisher=Theomegaorder.com |date=2015-12-18 |access-date=2016-09-07}}</ref> A CD release was announced for December 18, 2015, on [[The End Records]].<ref name="theomegaorder1"/>
