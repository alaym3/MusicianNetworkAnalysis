'''Jordan Maron''' (born February 10, 1992), also known by his online [[Pseudonym|alias]] '''CaptainSparklez''', is an American [[YouTuber]], [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] [[Video game live streaming|streamer]], [[gamer]], and [[electronic music]]ian. Maron is primarily known for playing the video game ''[[Minecraft]]'', which is featured on his main channel, CaptainSparklez, and the channel CaptainSparklez 2. His main channel is currently the 755th most-subscribed channel on [[YouTube]] with over 11.2 million subscribers as of August 2021.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCshoKvlZGZ20rVgazZp5vnQ |title=CaptainSparklez |website=socialblade.com |access-date=July 25, 2019}}.</ref>

Maron's first channel, ProsDONTtalkSHIT, was created in February 2010 and featured gameplay from the video game ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]''.<ref name=":0" /> Maron later created his main channel CaptainSparklez in July 2010, uploading both ''Minecraft'' and ''Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2'' gameplay before focusing mainly on ''Minecraft''.

Maron has produced several ''Minecraft''-themed songs and music videos, most notably "Revenge", a parody of "[[DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love]]" by [[Usher (musician)|Usher]], featuring vocals from himself and [[TryHardNinja]]. Other notable Minecraft music videos include his ''Fallen Kingdom'' [[tetralogy]] and "TNT". On his other channels, Maron also uploads [[reaction video]]s and gameplay of various other games including ''[[Fortnite]]'' and ''[[Trials Fusion]]''.

Maron is an electronic music enthusiast, having used tracks from the label [[Monstercat]] on gameplay videos. He has experimented with music production himself. On March 27, 2016, he created Maron Music, a music promotion channel where he would share other artists' music, as well as his own original music. "Moonbeam" was the first of his tracks to be uploaded to the channel.<ref name=":1" />

Beginning in early 2017, Maron uploaded videos featuring his reactions and commentary to various communities on [[Reddit]]. This led to a temporary decrease in ''Minecraft''-related content. Maron ultimately decided they were not what his core audience enjoyed watching.<ref name=":2" /> He proceeded to create the channel Jordan Reacts, where he continued to upload Reddit reaction videos, and refocused on making ''Minecraft'' videos for his main channel.

In January 2020, Maron announced his official clothing brand, Quality Content Athletics.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Quality Content Athletics on Instagram: "The official clothing brand of @jordanmaron Coming soon."|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B8AXPo2gMel/|access-date=2020-10-03|website=Instagram|language=en}}</ref> Throughout 2020, it has sold various workout and lifestyle apparel. In July 2021, he rebranded QC Athletics to [https://qualitycontent.com Quality Content].<ref>{{Cite web|title=QCAthletics|url=https://qcathletics.com/|access-date=2020-10-03|website=QCAthletics|language=en}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Maron was born in [[Los Angeles, California]]. At four years old, he and his mother moved to [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]]. He attended [[Santa Barbara High School]], beginning in ninth grade. Maron then went to the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] as a [[chemical engineering]] major. He decided to switch his major to [[computer science]] midway through his freshman year, based on his interest in video games. After the first quarter of his sophomore year, he dropped out. In December 2011, he made YouTube his full-time job.<ref name="DML" />

== Career ==
Maron owns a total of eleven YouTube channels. Four of his channels are currently active. On February 9, 2010, he created his first channel titled ProsDONTtalkSHIT (PDTS) where he primarily uploaded gameplay videos of ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]''.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/user/ProsDONTtalkSHIT |title=ProsDONTtalkSHIT |last=ProsDONTtalkSHIT |access-date=October 17, 2015 |newspaper=YouTube}}</ref> When PDTS began to become more popular, Maron decided he wanted a less vulgar name. He created a new channel named CaptainSparklez on July 20, 2010, and left PDTS inactive.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFkX2qrDdrw |title=A New Main Channel: Why? |last=Maron |first=Jordan |date=20 July 2010 |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=21 November 2018}}</ref> Nearly two years later in April 2012, the CaptainSparklez channel reached 1 million subscribers on YouTube.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/captain-sparklez-1-million-subscribers/|title=Captain Sparklez hits 1 million subscribers|last=Eördögh|first=Fruzsina|website=[[The Daily Dot]]|date=April 30, 2012|access-date=August 31, 2021}}</ref> In September 2013, CaptainSparklez reached 1 billion video views, becoming the fifth solo YouTube gaming channel to reach the milestone behind PewDiePie, SkyDoesMinecraft, UberHaxorNova and [[Tobuscus|TobyGames]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tubefilter.com/2013/09/05/youtube-billionaires-captain-sparklez/|title=YouTube Billionaires: All Hail Captain Sparklez|last=Gutelle|first=Sam|website=[[Tubefilter]]|date=September 5, 2013|access-date=August 31, 2021}}</ref>

On May 15, 2015, he created a channel called CaptainSparklez 2, where he uploaded unedited Twitch live streams and videos and other content he felt did not belong on his main channel. On March 27, 2016, he created Maron Music, a music promotion channel where he would share other artists' music, as well as his own original music.<ref name="youtube2">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHVvQgQd4JrIS_FOFbHOK0g |title=Maron Music - YouTube |publisher=youtube.com |access-date=August 14, 2016}}</ref> On February 9, 2017, Maron created a dedicated channel for personal [[vlog]]s. Maron later created "Fortnite Cinema", a channel which featured short films created in the game ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]''.

In early 2017, Maron began to upload videos featuring his reactions to top Reddit posts to his main channel. These reaction videos gained popularity, but Maron ultimately decided they were not what his core audience enjoyed watching.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySdghwPW1SQ |title=Goodbye For Now |last=Maron |first=Jordan |date=21 August 2018 |website=[[YouTube]] |language=en}}</ref> As a result, Maron created a new channel called Jordan Reacts on August 11, 2018, where he continued to upload Reddit reaction videos, and refocused on making ''[[Minecraft]]'' videos for his main channel. Maron's next channel is Jordan Games, where he uploads gameplay videos that would be irrelevant on his main channel. His newest channels are Jordan Lifts, featuring him lifting weights in his home gym, and SparkleShorts, containing small shots from various videos from the CaptainSparklez YouTube and Twitch channels and CaptainSparklez YouTube channel.

Maron was featured in the 2016 [[Forbes 30 Under 30|''Forbes'' 30 Under 30]] list.<ref name="forbes">{{Cite magazine |title=Forbes 30 Under 30 |url=https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30-2016/games/#7699488d6500 |magazine=forbes.com |access-date=August 14, 2016}}</ref> In June 2016, he made an appearance in the [[Minecraft: Story Mode#A Portal to Mystery (Episode 6)|sixth episode of ''Minecraft: Story Mode'']].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/31/minecraft-story-mode-episode-6-release-date-announced |title=Minecraft: Story Mode Episode 6 Release Date Announced |date=May 31, 2016 |website=[[IGN]] |access-date=November 21, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJ3xiDHH1XA |title=CAPTAINSPARKLEZ EXPOSED |last=CaptainSparklez |date=August 26, 2016 |via=YouTube}}</ref>

=== XREAL ===
Maron started a mobile gaming company called XREAL with Howard Marks, co-founder and former CEO of [[Activision]] and co-founder of [[Acclaim Games]] and StartEngine. XREAL released their game ''Fortress Fury'' in May 2015, which received over 1.5&nbsp;million downloads within its first month of launch.<ref name="tubefilter">{{Cite web |url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2015/06/26/captainsparklez-xreal-equity-crowdfunding-startengine/ |title=CaptainSparklez&#039;s Mobile Game Company Crowdfunds Capital Through StartEngine |date=June 26, 2015 |publisher=tubefilter.com |access-date=August 14, 2016}}</ref> ''Fortress Fury'' was originally titled ''Fortress Fallout''; however, [[ZeniMax Media]], parent company of [[Bethesda Softworks]], known for the [[Fallout (series)|''Fallout'' series]], sent a [[cease and desist]] letter which requested that XREAL "immediately expressly abandon the application for ''Fortress Fallout'' and cease any and all current or proposed use of any mark incorporating the term ''Fallout''."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/02/bethesda-parent-forces-fortress-fallout-developer-into-name-change/ |title=Bethesda parent forces Fortress Fallout developer into name change |date=February 17, 2015 |publisher=[[Arstechnica]] |access-date=November 27, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/2/16/8046579/bethesda-hits-fortress-fallout-maker-with-legal-name-change-demand |title=Bethesda hits Fortress Fallout maker with legal name-change demand |date=February 16, 2015 |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |access-date=November 27, 2016}}</ref> The letter was sent to prevent competition in the mobile game market for their game ''[[Fallout Shelter]]''. Maron and the XREAL's legal team were not informed of this,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=HyNx1YWZdIc |title=What Ever Happened to Fortress Fury? - YouTube |date=October 31, 2016 |publisher=CaptainSparklez}}</ref> because Bethesda kept ''Shelter'' a secret at the time and did not reveal its existence until its release on June 14, 2015.

=== Minecraft Championships ===
Minecraft Championship is a Minecraft Tournament for YouTubers and streamers run by the Noxcrew, in which 10 teams of four compete in a series of 8 minigames decided by the participants. A point multiplier makes each game worth more as each round passes, incentivizing teams to vote for games they might be bad at early on in the event. In the end, the two teams with the most points face off in a round of ‘Dodgebolt’ to decide the winner of the tournament. This makes it possible for a team to win despite potentially having fewer points than the runner-up.

Jordan has participated in every single event, yet never won. This is referred to among the community as the "Captain's Curse".
