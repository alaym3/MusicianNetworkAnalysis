In late 2018, Way went on Instagram Live and responded to fan comments suggesting Tyga had the biggest comeback of any artist in 2018. Way angrily claimed he had had the biggest comeback, with a snippet of the video going viral that same day.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8493166/soulja-boy-tyga-instagram-video |title=Soulja Boy Calls Out Fans for Dubbing Tyga Comeback Artist of 2018: 'Get the F--- Out of Here' |last=Lamarre |first=Carl |publisher=Billboard |date=January 11, 2019 |access-date=August 22, 2019}}</ref> Later in early 2019, Way made an appearance on the radio show [[The Breakfast Club (radio show)|''The Breakfast Club'']], where he defended his statements.

==Musical style==
Speaking on his rudimentary rapping technique and vacuous lyrical style, in a November 2010 interview with ''[[XXL Magazine]]'', while Way was explaining how he has grown as an [[rapper|emcee]] he stated:
<blockquote>I can't keep playin' around, because if you keep playin' around, people are gonna think you're a joke{{nbsp}}... At some point, you have to get serious. But don't get it twisted, Soulja doesn't wanna be the next [[Lupe Fiasco]]. I don't want to be super-Lupe-Fiasco-lyrical and niggas don't know what the fuck I'm talking about," he added. "I want to be the best," he continued. "I want to be recognized in that category where I'm nominated for Best Rapper with [[Jay-Z]] and [[Kanye West|Kanye]] and [[Lil Wayne|Wayne]]. I wanna get a [[Grammy]]. I want Best Rap Album of the Year{{nbsp}}... I've made millions of dollars off of doing my style, but, hey, I can rap, too.</blockquote>

On December 5, 2010, Way clarified this statement that Lupe Fiasco was too "lyrical", explaining that he wanted to keep the rudimentary music style he developed and justified why he doesn't keep a lyrically-based flow and more substantially profound lyrical subject matter on every song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sohh.com/2010/12/soulja_boy_on_lupe_fiasco_super_lyrical.html|title=SOHH.com - Soulja Boy On Lupe Fiasco "Super Lyrical" Remarks, "I Don't Even Care, 'Cause Controversy Sells"|date=July 20, 2015|work=SOHH.com|access-date=July 20, 2015}}</ref> According to Way:

<blockquote>[''XXL Magazine''] didn't [publish] my whole statement. And basically, the interviewer dude, he was asking me why do I make lyrical songs like 'Only God Knows,' 'Born'{{nbsp}}... 'The World So Cold,' and why do I make non-lyrical songs like '[[Crank That (Soulja Boy)|Crank That]]' and '[[Pretty Boy Swag]]'? And he was like, why don't I just be lyrical all the time? And I was telling him on [a] specific song, like 'Pretty Boy Swag,' I ain't wanna be all lyrical. I just wanted to be straight-up, and just be simple, [so] people can get what I'm saying 'cause it's a club song. But I wasn't saying as far as my whole music [output, with] all of my songs, that I don't wanna be rappin' like Lupe Fiasco.</blockquote>

Way further clarified there was no animosity between him and Fiasco and that the two had planned to record a song together.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/soulja-boy-plans-to-work-with-lupe-fiasco/|title = Soulja Boy Plans to Work with Lupe Fiasco - XXL}}</ref>

===Record production===
Way also produces records, including his own, primarily using the [[FL Studio]] digital audio workstation.<ref name="Jake Paine"/> In September 2007, Way produced [[V.I.C.]]'s single "[[Get Silly]]" which went certified gold and Bow Wow's single "[[Marco Polo (song)|Marco Polo]]".

===Ice-T===
In June 2008, on DJ Cisco's ''Urban Legend'' mixtape, [[Ice-T]] told Way to "eat a dick" and criticized Way for "killing hip-hop" and his song "Crank That" for being "garbage" compared to the works of other hip-hop artists such as [[Rakim]], [[Das EFX]], [[Big Daddy Kane]] and [[Ice Cube]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.7135/title.ice-t-tells-soulja-boy-to-eat-a-dick|title=Ice-T Tells Soulja Boy To Eat A Dick|first=Andreas|last=Hale|work=Hip Hop DX|date=June 17, 2008}}</ref> The two then traded videos back and forth over the Internet.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1589961/20080625/soulja_boy_tellem.jhtml Soulja Boy Tell'em Talks About New Album, Battle With Ice-T] [[MTV]].

In May 2011, Way's feud with Ice-T somewhat reignited, regarding the film ''[[Juice (film)|Juice]]''. Way stated he would release a movie of his own to go along with his mixtape of the same name, following a statement during Ice-T's interview with Shade 45 in late April 2011. Ice-T stated that Way's role as Bishop, which was famously originated by rapper [[Tupac Shakur]], was not an issue. But Ice-T found it problematic that the film was being remade, saying "What? But that's Pac{{nbsp}}... At some point, somebody gotta stop it. I came out. I made some statements. Man, I don't know. Do you, dude, do you. If the masses accept it, it shows you the state we're in{{nbsp}}... Come on man, you think I'd try to remake Pac's movie? Good luck though, I'm not a hater{{nbsp}}... eh."

===Chief Keef and Ballout===
On April 19, 2013, Way sent a number of death threats to Chicago rapper [[Chief Keef]] via Facebook. The threats were likely provoked by an earlier incident, where Keef's affiliate Ballout stole Way's chain and bragged about it on Twitter. Way posted both Keef's cellphone numbers, urging people to notify him he's coming for him with a gun. He continued posting, stating he's in Keef's hometown of Chicago and asking Keef and Ballout to come to him. Chief Keef responded that he is currently in London but would talk to Way on his new number. Later the same day, Way issued a statement that his Facebook, [[Instagram]] and email were hacked and none of the earlier messages were written by him.<ref>{{cite web|title=Soulja Boy Sends Chief Keef Death Threats, Gets Quick Response|url=http://rapfix.mtv.com/2013/04/19/soulja-boy-sends-chief-keef-death-threats-gets-quick-response/|publisher=MTV|access-date=April 19, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Soulja Boy Is Threatening to Murder Chief Keef on Facebook Right Now|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/04/soulja-boy-is-threatening-to-murder-chief-keef-on-facebook-right-now|publisher=Complex|access-date=April 19, 2013}}</ref> On June 1, 2014, Way revealed on his [[Instagram]] that he and fellow artist [[Chief Keef]] had resolved their differences.

===Atari===
On August 18, 2021, Way claimed during an Instagram Live stream that he had gained ownership of the video game company [[Atari]], saying "I am now the owner of Atari. I own the video game company Atari," and alleged that he had been given control of the company after they had been impressed with his ''SouljaGame'' console.
