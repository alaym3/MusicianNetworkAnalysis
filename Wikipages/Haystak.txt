'''Jason Winfree''' (born March 22, 1973), professionally known by his [[stage name]] '''Haystak''' is an American [[rapper]] from [[Nashville, Tennessee]]

==Early life==
Jason Winfree was born to teenage parents in [[Trenton, Tennessee]], outside of Nashville and was raised by his grandparents. At the age of 15, he was arrested and convicted for bringing [[Valium]] and [[cocaine]] to school. He served two years and when he was released began a music career. He rapped about his life as so-called "[[white trash]]", exploring the social dimensions of being white and underprivileged in the [[Southern United States|South]].

==Career==
In the late 1990s, he signed with a local rap label, Street Flavor, and began a business relationship with producers Kevin Grisham and Sonny Paradise. The partnership resulted in ''[[Mak Million]]'', Haystak's 1998 debut album, followed two years later by ''[[Car Fulla White Boys]]''. By this point Haystak had garnered a substantial regional following, and underground hardcore rap publication ''Murder Dog'' began promoting his work. The attention attracted the label [[Entertainment One Music|Koch Records]], who signed Haystak and re-released ''[[Car Fulla White Boys]]'' in late summer 2000. Two years later, Koch released Haystak's third album, ''[[The Natural (Haystak album)|The Natural]]''.

Haystak released his latest solo album entitled ''[[Easy 2 Hate]]'' on November 30, 2010 through Haystak, Inc.

Haystak is divorced and has two children. In addition to rap music, he has been featured on film ''[[Hustle & Flow]]'' where he played the [[Disc jockey|DJ]] named Mickey.

Haystak collaborated with fellow Nashville native [[JellyRoll]] on the albums ''[[Strictly Business (Haystak & Jelly Roll album)|Strictly Business]]'' in 2011 and its sequel ''[[Business as Usual (Haystak & Jelly Roll album)|Business As Usual]]'' in 2013.  

In June 2018, Statik G signed Haystak to his record label RhymeSick for a 5 year deal and immediately booked several national tours for the rest of the year into 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://faygoluvers.net/v5/2018/06/haystak-signs-to-rhymsick-entertainment-new-haywire-tour-dates-announced/|title=HAYSTAK Signs to Rhymesick Entertainment; New Haywire Tour Dates Announced!|last=D|first=Scottie|date=June 30, 2018|website=[[Faygoluvers]]|language=en-US|access-date=April 16, 2019}}</ref>
