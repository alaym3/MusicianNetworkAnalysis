'''''Pressa''''' was an International Press Exhibition held in [[Cologne]] between May and October, 1928.

As German exhibitors were barred from participating in the ''Exposition International des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modern'' held in [[Paris]] in 1925, that this exhibition was held in Germany indicated the rehabilitation of Germany as regards international projects of this kind.<ref name=Aynsley>{{cite journal|last1=Aynsley|first1=Jeremy|title=Pressa Cologne, 1928: Exhibitions and Publication Design in the Weimar Period|journal=Design Issues|date=1994|volume=10|issue=3|pages=52–76|jstor=1511692}}</ref>

====HAG-Turm====
The HAG-Turm was a 42m tower<ref name="HAG promotional leaflet">{{cite book |title= HAG-TURM auf der Pressa |date=1928 |publisher= Kaffee Hag}}</ref> built for [[Café HAG]].<ref name="adverts">{{cite book |p=54 |title= El Lissitzky: Beyond the Abstract Cabinet : Photography, Design, Collaboration |authors= Margarita Tupitsyn, Matthew Drutt, El Lissitzky, Ulrich Pohlmann}}</ref> This was built in 70 days.<ref name="HAG promotional leaflet"/> The architect was [[Bernhard Hoetger]], an architect who had previously worked for [[Ludwig Roselius]], the founder of Café Hag.<ref name="DW">{{cite web |title= Deutscher Werkbund NW - Hoetger |url= http://www.deutscherwerkbund-nw.de/index.php?id=277 |website= www.deutscherwerkbund-nw.de |publisher= Deutscher Werkbund, Nordrhein-Westfalen |accessdate= 15 April 2017 |language= de}}</ref> The building had ten storeys which contained all the working machinery necessary to create a working factory. 37 flags were on display on the front of tower representing the global reach of the company. Statistical and historical information was provided about coffee production, highlighting the part played by Café HAG. Scientific and medical experts were also present to provide further information to the public. Café HAG had become famous for their process of [[decaffination]] and so there was also information about the bad effects of [[caffeine]] on human and animal health.<ref name="CA">{{cite journal|last1=Milau|first1=Gerhard Ludwig|title=A World-wide Campaign for Selling Coffee|journal=Commercial Art|date=1928|volume=V|pages=244–261|url=http://magazines.iaddb.org/issue/CAI/1928-12-01/edition/null/page/260?query=Decorative%20Art&sort=pagenumber%20descending|accessdate=15 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416045233/http://magazines.iaddb.org/issue/CAI/1928-12-01/edition/null/page/260?query=Decorative%20Art&sort=pagenumber%20descending|archive-date=16 April 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>
