==Musical style and influences==
WSTR is generally credited as a [[pop punk]] band. The group's lead singer, Sammy Clifford, has said that many of his musical influences were from the [[United States]], including [[Blink-182]] and [[New Found Glory]].<ref>{{cite news |url =http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/british_pop_punks_wstr_frontman_discusses_the_rocky_road_to_his_bands_recor |title = British pop-punks WSTR's frontman discusses the rocky road to his band's record deal |date =17 October 2016 |access-date =28 August 2017 |work = Alternative Press}}</ref>
