== Life ==
=== Childhood and education ===
Müren was born in the Hisar district of [[Bursa]], at the wooden house number 30 on Ortapazar Road<ref name="HABERTÜRK">{{cite news|url=http://www.haberturk.com/yasam/haber/877875-gizli-kasadaki-zeki-muren|title=Gizli kasadaki Zeki Müren|author=Sultan Uçar|date=15 September 2013|accessdate=31 December 2013|work=HABERTÜRK}}</ref> as the only child of Kaya and Hayriye Müren.<ref name="HABERTÜRK"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trt.net.tr/Anasayfa/Anasayfa.aspx?aspxerrorpath=/radyo/HaberDetay.aspx|title=TRT - Anasayfa|website=TRT}}</ref> His father was a timber merchant. He was a small and impatient boy. At the age of 11 he was [[Circumcision|circumcised]] in Bursa.<ref name="Batmayan Güneş">''"Batmayan Güneş Zeki Müren" documentary. Publisher: [[Kürşat Özkök]]. [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation|TRT]]. Release date: 10–12 September 1996.''</ref>

Müren went to the Bursa Osmangazi School (later Tophane School and Alkıncı School). When he was at school, his musical ability was discovered by his teachers and he started to have a prominent role at school musicals. His first ever role was the character of a shepherd in one of these musicals.<ref name="Batmayan Güneş"/>

He finished his secondary school in Bursa and then asked his father to let him go to Istanbul. There he attended the Istanbul Boğaziçi High School. He finished the school and ended up as the number-one student.<ref name="Batmayan Güneş"/> After passing his exams, he was enrolled at the Istanbul State Academy of Fine Arts (now Mimar Sinan University) where he studied decorative arts from 1950 to 1953.<ref name="Batmayan Güneş"/>

=== Music career ===
[[File:Atatürk Boulevard, Grand Movie Theater and the Office Block, 1950s (16666319379).jpg|thumb|On 19 November 1953, Zeki Müren gave his first concert at the Great Cinema in [[Atatürk Boulevard]]]]

In 1950, while he was a university student, he took part at TRT Istanbul Radio's music competition and ranked number-one out of 186 contestants.<ref name="Batmayan Güneş"/> On 1 January 1951, he had his first live performance on Istanbul Radio, which was praised by critics. During this performance, he was accompanied by musicians Hakkı Derman, Serif İçli, Şükrü Tunar, Refik Fersan and Necdet Gezen. Hamiyet Yüceses subsequently called the program and congratulated him on his performance. In those years, TRT [[Ankara Radio]] was the most listened radio in Anatolia, and Istanbul Radio could not be heard clearly from all parts of Anatolia. At the same week, the clarinetist Şükrü Tunar, took Müren to his own recording studio in Yeşilköy and he recorded his song "Muhabbet Kuşu" on phonograph record. Thanks to this record, Müren became known all over Anatolia.<ref name="Batmayan Güneş"/>

After the success of his first live performance and his first record, Müren began to perform different songs on Turkish radios. His radio programs went on air for 15 years, most of which included live performances. Müren subsequently focused on giving concerts and recording new songs. He had his first live concert on 26 May 1955. He would usually wear his self-designed clothes on stage. He brought various innovations such as dressing uniforms and using T podium.<ref name="Batmayan Güneş"/>

Together with [[Behiye Aksoy]], he performed at Maksim Casino<ref>{{cite news| url = http://onedio.com/haber/-sanat-gunesi-anildi-170109 | title = "Sanat Güneşi" Anıldı | date = 24 September 2013 | accessdate = 31 December 2013 | publisher = Onedio }}</ref> for 11 years.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://cevaplar.mynet.com/soru-cevap/maksim-gazinosu-sahnelerinde-araliksiz-11-yil-behi-/6275570 | title = Maksim Gazinosu sahnelerinde aralıksız 11 yıl Behiye Aksoy ile dönüşümlü olarak sahne almış olan TSM.mizin unutulmaz sanat güneşi kimdir? | date =  | accessdate = 31 December 2013 | work = Mynet | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150204143255/http://cevaplar.mynet.com/soru-cevap/maksim-gazinosu-sahnelerinde-araliksiz-11-yil-behi-/6275570 | archivedate = 4 February 2015}}</ref> In 1976, he became the first Turkish artist to perform at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London.<ref>{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXU1O0Gd1ME |title=ARŞİV ODASI: Zeki Müren, 1976 - BBC TÜRKÇE |work=BBC Türkçe |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref>

Throughout his career, Müren recorded 600 cassettes and phonograph records. His first song recorded on a phonograph was "Bir Muhabbet Kuşu"  by Şükrü Tunar. With his song "Manolyam" in 1955, Müren became the first Turkish artist to receive a gold certification.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://listelist.com/sanat-gunesi-zeki-muren/ | title = Sanat Güneşi Zeki Müren’in İlklerle Dolu Rengârenk Hayatı | work = ListeList.com | date = 24 September 2014 | author = Emel Gülcan | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208223623/http://listelist.com:80/sanat-gunesi-zeki-muren/ | archivedate = 8 December 2015}}</ref> In 1991, he was chosen as a [[State Artist (Turkey)|State Artist]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://guzelsanatlar.kulturturizm.gov.tr/Genel/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFF63F3FD91FC2A1E7D1084D1ED2B222F12 | title = 1991 Yılında Seçilen Devlet Sanatçıları | accessdate = 4 April 2010 | publisher = T.C.

== Other ventures ==
In 1965, he published a poetry book called ''Bıldırcın Yağmuru'' (''The Quail Rain''), which contains nearly 100 poems.<ref name="Batmayan Güneş"/> Among the poems featured in this book are ''Pembe Yağmurlar (Pink Rains)'', ''Bursa Sokağı (Bursa Street)'', ''İkinci Sadık Dost'', ''Çim Makası'', ''Son Kavga (Last Fight)'', ''Bu Bestecikler Sana'', ''Alınyazım'', ''Kazancı Yokuşu'' and ''Kendimi Arıyorum''.<ref>''[http://www.sanatgunesi.com/0hatira.htm "Eserleri hakkında"].

== Personal life ==
Zeki Müren never married. In the 1950s, with his special patterns of behavior, dressing and his performance on stage, he managed to keep people constantly interested in himself. In the early years of his career, he chose to wear ordinary clothes and hair styles, but later showed a favor for feminine-styled clothes, and performed with new hair styles and make-up. He never commented on his [[sexual orientation]] and occasionally his name appeared alongside that of women.<ref>[http://www.sariyerhaber.org/news_detail.php3?id=3760 Zeki Müren'e Sarıyer'de "çakma aşk"] [[Aykut Işıklar]].

He was known to speak Turkish with a viscous accent. Referred to as the "[[Pasha]] of Music", in 1969, after his [[Aspendos]] concert, for the first time, he started being favored by the people of Antalya. He explained that although he was delighted because of their support, he still did not know why he was that much favored.<ref>''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2sUiJ6K-bA Yasemin Bozkurt röportajı, 1985] Youtube.com.
