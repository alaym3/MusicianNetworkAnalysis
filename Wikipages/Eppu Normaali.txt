'''Eppu Normaali''' is one of the most popular rock bands in [[Finland]]. The band formed in 1976 in [[Ylöjärvi]], a small town near [[Tampere]]. The band is the best-selling music artist in Finland, with [[List of music recording certifications|certified]] sales of nearly two million records,<ref name="YLE40">{{cite web |url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9075671 |title= Pamputtaako poliisi vai saadaanko suolaista sadetta? Seuraa Eppu Normaalin juhlakonsertin tunnelmia  |website=Yle |access-date=24 September 2016 |language=fi}}</ref>  and it has also gained success especially in the use of the [[Finnish language]] in rock lyrics. In addition to their studio albums, Eppu Normaali also released live records, DVDs, and over 20 singles.

Eppu Normaali's most famous songs include "Vuonna '85" (In the Year '85), "Kitara, taivas ja tähdet" (The Guitar, the Sky and the Stars), "Murheellisten laulujen maa" (Land of Sad Songs), "Pimeyden tango" (Tango of Darkness), "Suolaista sadetta" (Salty Rain) and "Tahroja paperilla" (Stains on Paper).

==History==
The members of the original band were Juha Torvinen (guitar), Mikko Saarela (bass), Aku Syrjä (drums), and brothers Martti Syrjä (vocals) and Mikko "Pantse" Syrjä (guitar). (The brothers are the sons of accomplished writers [[Kirsi Kunnas]] and Jaakko Syrjä).<ref name="europop">[http://www.europopmusic.eu/Scandanavia_pages/Eppu_Normaali.html Europopmusic's Eppu Normaali profile]</ref> In 1979, bassist Mikko Saarela left the band, and Mikko Nevalainen played bass with Eppu Normaali until 1989. The current bassist is Sami Ruusukallio.

The band took its name from a character in the [[Mel Brooks]] movie ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'', and the subtitler translated the name of the character ''Abby Normal'' (''abnormal'') into the Finnish equivalent ''Eppu Normaali'' (''epänormaali'', roughly 'abnormal'; a Finnish equivalent of the original play with words).<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/eppu-normaali-mn0001794850/biography |title= Eppu Normaali  Biography |last1=Lindroos |first1=JT |website=All Music Guide |access-date=24 September 2016}}</ref>

In 1977, the band participated in a local rock music competition. Finnish folk/pop legend [[Juice Leskinen]] was present and issued a demand that they "must win", but the judges were unimpressed—the band did not win. The band began sending [[Demo (music)|demos]] to various record companies and they were soon signed to Poko Rekords.

They initially released albums in a [[Punk rock|punk]] pop style that gained favourable reviews, but the band did not gain mainstream acceptance until 1984 with what had evolved into a more [[Album-oriented rock|AOR]]-oriented music style. ''Rupisia Riimejä Karmeita Tarinoita'' was released in 1984, and it was followed by ''Kahdeksas Ihme'' in 1985 and ''Valkoinen Kupla'' in 1986. This trio of albums were all hits, with combined sales of over 300,000 copies. ''Kahdeksas Ihme'' is their top-selling non-greatest hits record to date.<ref name="eppusales">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.fi/tilastot/artistit/eppu+normaali|title=Eppu Normaali|publisher=[[Musiikkituottajat &ndash; IFPI Finland]]|language=fi|access-date=2011-06-13}}</ref>

Although their albums all sold well, the band decided to take a break in 1989 after intensive tours around the country and when Mikko Nevalainen left the group. In 1993, they released ''Studio Etana'', which was to become their last studio album for eleven years. The band came close to breaking up, citing "lacking inspiration" as the primary cause. Their 1996 release ''Repullinen hittejä'', a greatest hits compilation sold over 240,000 copies,<ref name="fincharts">[http://finnishcharts.com/bestall_a.asp Finnish Charts]</ref> reaching the top of the Finnish charts. This record also stayed on the charts for over two years, a duration which is second of all time in Finland.<ref name="fincharts"/> After its release, the band effectively stopped touring or performing live.<ref name="europop"/>

In 2004, the band announced they would record a new album, ''Sadan vuoden päästäkin'', which became one of the band's most successful releases.<ref name="eppusales"/> In 2007, they released their most recent album, ''Syvään päähän''.<ref name="AMG"/>

In 2016, the band celebrated its 40th anniversary with a documentary film, book, photo exhibition and a massive show on Ratina stadium.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iltalehti.fi/viihde/2016051821584365_vi.shtml |title=Eppu Normaalilla yllätys juhlavuoden kunniaksi: Bändistä dokumenttielokuva |last1=Vatka |first1=Miia |website=Iltalehti |access-date=24 September 2016 |language=fi}}</ref> The stadium concert had over 30 000 spectators.<ref name="YLE40"/>
