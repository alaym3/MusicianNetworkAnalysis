She launched her solo career in 2008 after signing with [[9th Wonder]]'s [[It's A Wonderful World Music Group]]. Her first significant career breakthrough came with the release of her mixtape ''Return of the B-Girl'' on December 7, 2010.

==Style and philosophy==
Rapsody is known for her intricate rhyme patterns, metaphors, and wordplay. She cites [[Jay-Z]], [[Mos Def]], [[Lauryn Hill]] and [[MC Lyte]] as the biggest influences on her music. Her production is primarily handled by The Soul Council, the team of in-house producers at It's A Wonderful World Music Group comprising E. Jones, Ka$h Don't Make Beats, AMP, Eric G., Nottz and Khrysis. Rapsody's philosophy is "Culture Over Everything," referring to the culture of hip-hop music. She describes this phrase in an interview with [[Vibe Magazine]] where she says, "To me, it’s about culture more so than money or anything. I make music for the people of the culture we’re in; that comes first. If you touch the people first, the rest just falls into place. That’s what it means to me, just preserving and respecting the culture."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/contents/watch-your-throne-rapsody-discusses-becoming-female-jay-z-and-what-expect-thank-her-now-pg- |title=Watch Your Throne!

==Personal life==
In her younger years, she watched the [[MTV]] show ''[[Yo! MTV Raps]]'' and considered [[MC Lyte]] as one of her early influences and later stated [[Lauryn Hill]] as an all-time favorite.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Yeh|first1=Samantha|title=Where My Ladies At?|url=https://readymag.com/u52312166/64440/|website=readymag.com|publisher=Ready Magazine|access-date=2017-10-22}}</ref> She grew up in the small town of Snow Hill in North Carolina. Rapsody wasn't exposed to much hip hop and would listen to what her older cousins would play in the car. She would later develop her love for hip hop when she entered college.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Frank Stasio|first1=Charlie Shelton|title=Looking At The World Through Rhyme: Meet Rapsody|url=http://wunc.org/post/looking-world-through-rhyme-meet-rapsody#stream/0|website=wunc.org|publisher=North Carolina Public Radio|access-date=2017-10-22}}</ref>

Her 2017 album ''Laila's Wisdom'' was named after her grandmother, Laila Ray.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|last1=Hutchinson|first1=Jacob|title=Rapsody clever, insightful in 'Laila's Wisdom'|url=http://www.thepantheronline.com/features/reviews/rapsody-clever-insightful-lailas-wisdom|website=thepantheronline.com|publisher=The Panther|access-date=2017-10-22}}</ref>
