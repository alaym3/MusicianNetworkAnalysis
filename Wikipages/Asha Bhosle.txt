==Early life and career==
Asha Bhosle was born in the small hamlet of Goar in [[Sangli]], then in the [[Salute state|salute]] [[princely state]] of [[Sangli State|Sangli]] (now in [[Maharashtra]]), into the musical family of [[Deenanath Mangeshkar]], who was [[Marathi people|Marathi]] and [[Konkani people|Konkani]] and his [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] wife, Shevanti. Bhosle's father was an actor and classical singer on [[Marathi theatre|
Marathi Musical stage]]. When she was nine years old, her father died. The family moved from [[Pune]] to [[Kolhapur]] and then to [[Mumbai]]. She and her elder sister [[Lata Mangeshkar]] began singing and acting in films to support their family. She sang her first film song '"Chala Chala Nav Bala" for the [[Marathi cinema|Marathi film]] ''Majha Bal'' (1943). The music for the film was composed by [[Datta Davjekar]]. She made her Hindi film debut when she sang the song "Saawan Aaya" for [[Hansraj Behl]]'s ''Chunariya'' (1948).<ref name="rediff_70">{{cite web

At the age of 16, she eloped with 31-year-old Ganpatrao Bhosle, marrying him against her family's wishes.

==Career==
[[File:Asha Bhosle - still 47160 crop.jpg|thumb|right|Bhosle in 2008]]
In the early 1960s, prominent playback singers like [[Geeta Dutt]], [[Shamshad Begum]], and [[Lata Mangeshkar]] dominated the singing for the female lead and the big films. Asha used to get the assignments they refused: singing for the bad girls and [[Vamp (woman)|vamps]], or songs in low-budget movies. In the 1950s, she sang more songs than most playback singers in Bollywood. Most of these were in [[low budget]] B- or C-grade films. Her earliest songs were composed by [[A R Qureshi|A. R. Qureshi]], [[Sajjad Hussain (composer)|Sajjad Hussain]], and [[Ghulam Mohammed (composer)|Ghulam Mohammed]], and most of these songs failed to do well.<ref name="rediff_70"/> Singing in ''Sangdil'' (1952), composed by Sajjad Hussain, she got reasonable recognition. Consequently, film director [[Bimal Roy]] gave her a chance to sing in ''[[Parineeta (1953 film)|Parineeta]]'' (1953). [[Raj Kapoor]] signed her to sing "Nanhe Munne Bachche" with [[Mohammed Rafi]] in ''[[Boot Polish (film)|Boot Polish]]'' (1954), which gained popularity.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Rao|first=Gayatri|date=2016-11-14|title=Nanhe munne bachche teri muthi mein kya hai – Rafi/Asha – Shankar–Jaikishan {{!}} Boot Polish (1954)|url=https://lemonwire.com/2016/11/14/nanhe-munne-bachche-teri-muthi-mein-kya-hai-rafiasha-shankar-jaikishan-boot-polish-1954/|access-date=2020-09-21|website=LemonWire|language=en-US}}</ref>

[[O. P. Nayyar]] gave Asha a break in ''[[C.I.D. (1956 film)|C.I.D.]]'' (1956). She first achieved success in [[B. R. Chopra]]'s ''[[Naya Daur (1957 film)|Naya Daur]]'' (1957), composed by him. Her duets with [[Mohammad Rafi|Rafi]] like "Maang Ke Saath Tumhara", "Saathi Haath Badhana" and "Uden Jab Jab Zulfein Teri", penned by [[Sahir Ludhianvi]], earned her recognition. It was the first time she sang all the songs for a film's leading actress. Chopra approached her for several of his later productions, including ''[[Gumrah (1963 film)|Gumrah]]'' (1963), ''[[Waqt (1965 film)|Waqt]]'' (1965), ''[[Hamraaz]]'' (1967), ''[[Aadmi Aur Insaan]]'' (1966) and ''[[Dhund (1973 film)|Dhund]]'' (1973). Nayyar's future collaboration with Bhosle also resulted in success. Gradually, she established her status and received the patronage of such composers as [[Sachin Dev Burman]] and [[Ravi (music director)|Ravi]]. Bhosle and Nayyar had a professional and personal parting of ways in the 1970s.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=The stubborn note of O P Nayyar|url=https://www.rediff.com/movies/2003/feb/04dinesh.htm|access-date=2020-09-21|website=www.rediff.com}}</ref>

In 1966, Bhosle's performances in the duets from one of music director [[Rahul Dev Burman|R.D. Burman's]] first soundtracks, for the movie ''[[Teesri Manzil]]'', won popular acclaim. Reportedly, when she first heard the dance number "Aaja Aaja", she felt she would not be able to sing this westernised tune. While Burman offered to change the music, she refused, taking it as a challenge. She completed the song after ten days of rehearsals, and "Aaja Aaja", along with such other songs as "O Haseena Zulfonwali" and "O Mere Sona Re" (all three duets with Rafi), became successful. [[Shammi Kapoor]], the film's leading actor, was once quoted as saying– "If I did not have Mohammad Rafi to sing for me, I would have got Asha Bhosle to do the job". Bhosle's collaboration with Burman resulted in numerous hits and a marriage. During the 1960-70s, she was the voice of Bollywood's actress and dancer, [[Helen (actress)|Helen]], on whom "O Haseena Zulfon Wali" was picturised. It is said that Helen would attend her recording sessions so that she could understand the song better and plan dance steps accordingly.<ref>{{cite news|title=Asha Unplugged over the years|url=http://movies.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-3457219,prtpage-1.cms|date=8 September 2008|author=Malani, Gaurav|publisher=[[Indiatimes]]|access-date=2009-07-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912143433/http://movies.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-3457219,prtpage-1.cms|archive-date=12 September 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Some of their other popular numbers include "[[Piya Tu Ab To Aaja]]" (''[[Caravan (1971 film)|Caravan]]'') and "Yeh Mera Dil" (''[[Don (1978 film)|Don]]''), among others.

By the 1980s, Bhosle, although highly regarded {{By whom| date= October 2011}} for her abilities and versatility, had sometimes been stereotyped {{By whom| date= October 2011}} as a "cabaret singer" and a "pop crooner". In 1981 she attempted a different genre by singing several [[ghazal]]s for the [[Rekha]]-starrer ''[[Umrao Jaan (1981 film)|Umrao Jaan]]'', including "Dil Cheez Kya Hai", "In Aankhon Ki Masti Ke", "Yeh Kya Jagah Hai Doston" and "Justuju Jiski Thi". The film's music director [[Mohammed Zahur Khayyam|Khayyam]], had lowered her pitch by half a note. Bhosle herself expressed surprise that she could sing so differently. The ghazals won her the first [[National Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer|National Film Award]] of her career. A few years later, she won another National Award for the song "[[Mera Kuchh Saamaan]]" from ''[[Ijaazat]]'' (1987).

In 1995, 62-year-old Bhosle sang for actress [[Urmila Matondkar]] in the movie ''[[Rangeela (1995 film)|Rangeela]]''. The soundtrack featured songs like "Tanha Tanha" and "Rangeela Re" sung by her, and composed by music director [[A. R. Rahman]], who would go on to record several songs with her. During the 2000s, several of Bhosle's numbers became chartbusters, including "Radha Kaise Na Jale" from ''[[Lagaan]]'' (2001), "Kambakht Ishq" from ''[[Pyaar Tune Kya Kiya]]'' (2001), "Yeh Lamha" from ''[[Filhaal]]'' (2002) and "Lucky Lips" from ''[[Lucky: No Time for Love|Lucky]]'' (2005). In October 2004, ''The Very Best of Asha Bhosle, The Queen of Bollywood'', a compilation album of songs recorded by Bhosle for albums and Bollywood films that were released between 1966 and 2003, was released.

In 2012 she judged [[Sur Kshetra]].

In 2013, Bhosle debuted in the film ''[[Mai (2013 film)|Mai]]'' in the title role, at the age of 79. Bhosle played the role of a 65-year-old mother who suffers from [[Alzheimer's disease]] and is abandoned by her children.<ref name=Only>{{cite news | url=http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/ENT----mai-will-be-my-only-experiment-with-acting----asha-bhosle-4163843-NOR.html | title='Mai' will be my only experiment with acting: Asha Bhosle | newspaper=[[Dainik Bhaskar]] | date=30 January 2013 | access-date=3 February 2013 | author=Jha, Subhash K}}</ref> She received positive reviews for her acting as well from critics.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://movies.ndtv.com/movie-reviews/movie-review-i-mai-i-780 | title=Movie review: Mai | publisher=NDTV | date=1 February 2013 | access-date=3 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.filmfare.com/reviews/movie-review-mai-2269.html | title=Movie Review: Mai | magazine=[[Filmfare]] | date=2 February 2013 | access-date=3 February 2013 | author=Gupta, Rachit}}</ref>

==Partnership with music directors==

===O. P. Nayyar===

Music director [[O. P. Nayyar]]'s association with Asha is part of [[Bollywood]] lore. He was the composer who first gave Asha her own identity. Many people have speculated about a romantic relationship between the two.

Nayyar first met Asha in 1952, at the music recording of ''Chham Chhama Chham''.<ref name="ref_O_P_Nayyar">

</ref> He first called her for a film called ''Mangu'' (1954), and gave her a big break in ''[[C.I.D. (1956 film)|C.I.D.]]'' (1956). However, it was the success of ''[[Naya Daur (1957 film)|Naya Daur]]'' (1957) that made the duo very popular. After 1959, she was emotionally and professionally involved with Nayyar.

The team of O. P. Nayyar and Asha Bhosle is best remembered for their breezy and sometimes [[Siren (mythology)|siren]]ish songs. Some good examples of their sensuous numbers are "Aaiye Meherbaan" picturised on [[Madhubala]] (''[[Howrah Bridge (film)|Howrah Bridge]]'', 1958) and "Yeh Hai Reshmi Zulfon Ka Andhera", (''[[Mere Sanam]]'', 1965). "[[Aao Huzoor Tumko]]" (''Kismat'') and "Jaaiye Aap Kahan" (''Mere Sanam'') were also popular. They also recorded songs for many hit movies like ''[[Tumsa Nahin Dekha (1957 film)|Tumsa Nahin Dekha]]'' (1957), ''[[Ek Musafir Ek Hasina]]'' (1962) and ''[[Kashmir Ki Kali]]'' (1964). O. P. Nayyar used the Asha Bhosle-[[Mohammad Rafi]] duo for his most popular duets such as "Ude Jab Jab Zulfein Teri" (''Naya Daur''), "Main Pyaar Ka Rahi Hoon" (''Ek Musafir Ek Haseena''), "Deewana Hua Baadal" and "Ishaaron Ishaaron Mein" (''Kashmir Ki Kali'').<ref name=":1" />

Asha recorded her last song for O. P. Nayyar in the movie ''[[Pran Jaye Par Vachan Na Jaye]]'' (1974). The solo number "Chain Se Humko Kabhi" garnered many awards, but it was not included in the movie.

They separated on 5 August 1972. It is not clear what made them part their ways. On being asked the reason for their parting, O. P. Nayyar once said, "I know astrology very well. I knew that one day I had to part with her. Something also happened that upset me, so I left her."<ref name="ref_O_P_Nayyar" /> Nevertheless, he also said "...now that I am seventy-six, I can say that the most important person in my life was Asha Bhosle. She was the best person I ever met."

The parting of Asha Bhosle and O. P. Nayyar was bitter, and probably therefore she has hesitated to give Nayyar his due. While talking about O. P. Nayyar in an interview with [[The Times of India]], she once remarked, "Whichever composer gave me work, it was because my voice was suited to his music at that point. No ''one'' musician did me any favor by asking me to sing for him."<ref name="Times_Life_Jul_2005">{{cite news

===Khayyam===
Another music director who recognized Asha's talent early was [[Mohammed Zahur Khayyam|Khayyam]]. Their partnership dates back to his first movie ''Biwi'' (1948). Khayyam gave her some good assignments in the 1950s, including ''Dard'' and ''Phir Subah Hogi''. However, their collaboration is chiefly remembered for the songs of ''[[Umrao Jaan (1981 film)|Umrao Jaan]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bharatan|first1=Raju|title=A journey down melody lane|date=2010|publisher=Hay House Publishers (India)|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788189988913|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WnxABAAAQBAJ&q=nayyar+asha+bhosle&pg=PT6}}</ref>

===Ravi===
Music composer [[Ravi (music director)|Ravi]] considered Asha one of his favorite singers. She sang for his first movie ''[[Vachan]]'' (1955). The melodious [[lullaby]] from this movie, "Chanda Mama Door Ke" became an overnight hit among young mothers in India. Ravi got her to sing [[bhajan]]s for the movies ''[[Gharana]]'', ''[[Grahasti (film)|Grihasti]]'', ''[[Kaajal]]'' and ''[[Phool Aur Patthar]]'', at a time when most of the composers remembered her only when they needed to record B-grade songs picturized on the vamps or the side-heroines. Ravi and Asha recorded a variety of songs, including the popular comic duet with [[Kishore Kumar]]&nbsp;– "C A T...Cat. Cat Maane Billi" (''[[Dilli Ka Thug]]'').

She and Burman gave many hit songs in movies such as ''Kaala Pani'', ''Kaala Bazaar'', ''Insaan Jaag Utha'', ''Lajwanti'', ''[[Sujata (1959 film)|Sujata]]'' and ''Teen Deviyaan'' (1965). They recorded many songs together after 1962 as well. Most famous of these songs were Asha's duets with [[Mohammed Rafi]] and [[Kishore Kumar]]. The song "Ab Ke Baras" in Bimal Roy's ''[[Bandini (1963 film)|Bandini]]'' (1963) consolidated her position as a lead singer. The seductive song "Raat Akeli Hai" from ''[[Jewel Thief]]'' (1967), picturised on [[Tanuja]], became very popular.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Rahul Dev Burman (Pancham)===

Asha first met [[Rahul Dev Burman]] (also known as Pancham) when she was the mother of two and he was in 10th grade having dropped out to pursue music. Their partnership was first noticed in ''Teesri Manzil'' (1966). She went on to record a variety of songs with him&nbsp;– [[cabaret]]s, rock, [[disco]], [[ghazal]]s and [[Indian classical music|classical]].

In the 1970s, Asha and Burman's youthful Western songs took Bollywood music by storm&nbsp;– the raunchy [[cabaret]] "[[Piya Tu Ab To Aaja]]" (''[[Caravan (1971 film)|Caravan]]'', picturized on [[Helen (actress)|Helen]]), the rebellious "[[Dum Maro Dum (song)|Dum Maro Dum]]" (''[[Hare Rama Hare Krishna (1971 film)|Hare Rama Hare Krishna]]'', 1971), the sexy "Duniya Mein" (''[[Apna Desh]]'', 1972) and the romantic "Chura Liyaa Hai Tumne" (''[[Yaadon Ki Baaraat]]'', 1973). Burman also recorded many hit duets with Asha and Kishore Kumar such as "Jaane Jaan" (''[[Jawani Diwani]]'') and "Bhali Bhali Si Ek Soorat" (''[[Buddha Mil Gaya (film)|Buddha Mil Gaya]]'').

In the 1980s, Burman and Asha recorded subtle numbers for films like ''[[Ijaazat]]'' (1987) - "[[Mera Kuch Saaman]]", "Khaali Haath Shaam Aayi Hai" and "Katra Katra". They also recorded the popular duet "O Maria!" (''[[Saagar (1985 film)|Saagar]]'').

Asha used to call R. D. Burman "Bubs". She married him in 1980. Their partnership lasted until his death.

R. D. Burman made her sing some of the most legendary songs in Bengali as well, namely "Mohuyae Jomechhe Aaj Mou Go", "Chokhe Chokhe Kotha Bolo", "Chokhhe Naame Brishti" (Bengali version of "Jaane Kya Baat Hai"), "Baanshi Sune Ki Ghore Thaka Jaye", "Sondhya Belae Tumi Aami" and "Aaj Gungun Gun Gunje Amar" (Bengali version of "Pyaar Deewana Hota Hai").

===Ilaiyaraaja===
Prolific Indian film composer [[Ilaiyaraaja]] began employing Asha's vocals in the early 1980s, their earliest collaboration being for the film ''[[Moondram Pirai]]'' (1982) (remade in Hindi as ''Sadma'' in 1983). Their association continued, mostly through the latter half of the 1980s and early 1990s. Another notable song from this period is "Shenbagamae" for the movie [[Enga Ooru Pattukaran]] in 1987. In 2000, Asha sung the theme song for [[Kamal Haasan]]'s political film ''[[Hey Ram]]''. The song, "Nee Partha Parvai" in Tamil and ''Janmon Ki Jwala'' in Hindi (or Aparna's Theme), was a duet with singer [[Hariharan (singer)|Hariharan]].

===A. R. Rahman===
[[A. R. Rahman]] is credited with Asha's "comeback" with ''[[Rangeela (1995 film)|Rangeela]]'' (1994). Songs like "Tanha Tanha" and "Rangeela Re" were chartbusters. She and Rahman went on to record more hits like "Mujhe Rang De" (''[[Thakshak]]''), "Radha Kaise Na Jale" (''[[Lagaan]]'', duet with [[Udit Narayan]]), "Kahin Aag Lage" (''[[Taal (film)|Taal]]''), "O Bhanware" (''[[Daud (film)|Daud]]'', duet with [[K. J. Yesudas]]), "Venilla Venilla" (''[[Iruvar]]'', 1999), "September Madham" (''[[Alaipayuthey]]'', 2000) and "Dhuan Dhuan" (''[[Meenaxi (Soundtrack)|Meenaxi]]'', 2004).<ref name="rediff_70"/>

===Jaidev===
When [[S D Burman]]'s assistant [[Jaidev]] started giving music independently, he got Asha to sing some of his songs as well. They worked in ''[[Hum Dono (1961 film)|Hum Dono]]'' (1961), ''[[Mujhe Jeene Do]]'' (1963), ''[[Do Boond Pani]]'' (1971) and other movies. In 1971, the pair released an LP of eight non-film devotional songs and [[ghazal]]s called ''An Unforgettable Treat''. Asha considered Jaidev a close friend who stood by her when she was struggling personally and professionally. Upon his death in 1987, she released a compilation album of lesser-known songs he had composed for her, called ''Suranjali''.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Shankar–Jaikishan===
[[Shankar–Jaikishan]] worked with Asha, although not as extensively as some other composers did. However, the trio produced quite a few hits including the seductive "Parde Mein Rehne Do" (''[[Shikar (1968 film)|Shikar]]'', 1968). Asha got her second [[Filmfare Award]] for the song. She also sang "[[Zindagi Ek Safar Hai Suhana]]" (''[[Andaz (1971 film)|Andaz]]'', 1971) for Shankar–Jaikishan, in which she tried to [[yodel]] like Kishore Kumar, whose version of the song is more popular. Shankar–Jaikishan also used her voice in ''[[Boot Polish (film)|Boot Polish]]'' (1954), ''[[Shree 420]]'' (1955), ''[[Jis Desh Mein Ganga Behti Hai]]'' (1960), ''[[Junglee (1961 film)|Junglee]]'' (1961), ''[[An Evening in Paris]]'' (1968), and ''[[Kal Aaj Aur Kal]]'' (1971), among others. ''When'' Raj Kapoor was not on speaking terms with Lata Mangeshkar, Asha sang the songs of ''[[Mera Naam Joker]]'' (1970).

===Anu Malik===
Composer [[Anu Malik]] and Asha have recorded many hit singles together, including songs for his first movie ''[[Sohni Mahiwal]]'' (1984). Their most popular songs include "Ye Lamhaa Filhaal" (''Filhaal'') and "Kitabein Bahut Si" (''[[Baazigar]]'') among others. The four lines sung by Asha in Malik's "Jab Dil Mile" (''[[Yaadein (2001 film)|Yaadein]]'') stood out among voices of Sukhwinder Singh, [[Udit Narayan]] and [[Sunidhi Chauhan]]. Asha had also sung for Anu's father Sardar Malik in the 1950s and 1960s, most notably in ''Saranga'' (1960).

===Other composers===
[[Madan Mohan (music director)|Madan Mohan]] recorded a number of songs with Asha, including the popular folk number "Jhumka Gira Re" picturised on [[Sadhana Shivdasani|Sadhana]] from ''[[Mera Saaya]]'' (1966). In ''[[Chhoti Si Baat]]'' (1975), Asha sang the "Jaaneman Jaaneman" number with [[K. J. Yesudas]] for [[Salil Chowdhury]]. Salil's 1956 movie ''[[Jagte Raho]]'' also had a number recorded by Asha, "Thandi Thandi Saawan Ki Phuhaar". Another Asha patron is the young composer [[Sandeep Chowta]], who got her to sing "Kambakht Ishq", a duet with Sonu Nigam for the movie ''Pyaar Tune Kya Kiya'' (2001). The song gained major popularity among the Indian youth.

Asha has worked with Lata-patrons like [[Laxmikant–Pyarelal]], [[Naushad Ali]], [[Ravindra Jain]], [[Datta Naik|N. Dutta]] and [[Hemant Kumar]]. When Naushad was asked to sum up the essential difference between Lata and Asha, he said that Asha "lacks certain something which Lata, and Lata alone has." Later he stated in an interview, "Maybe I said it because I then had a closed ear on Asha".<ref name="Girija">

===Private albums===
In a rare feat, noted lyricist [[Gulzar (lyricist)|Gulzar]], music director [[R.D. Burman]] and Asha Bhosle came together in 1987 to create a double album, titled ''[[Dil Padosi Hai]]'', which was released on 8 September 1987.<ref>{{YouTube|uwTBsElMeuw|''Dil Padosi Hai'', release}}</ref> In 1995, Asha underwent the ''gatha bandan'' (thread-tying) ceremony with [[Hindustani classical music]] maestro [[Ali Akbar Khan]] to learn a classical repertoire held within the Maihar ''gharana'' (stylistic school of Indian classical music), as handed down to Khan by his father [[Allauddin Khan]] (the guru of [[Ravi Shankar]]). Later, Asha and Ustad Ali Akbar Khan recorded eleven fixed compositions (or ''bandish''es) in California for ''Legacy'', a private album that earned them a [[Grammy Award]] nomination.

In the 1990s, Asha experimented with [[remix]]ed R.D. Burman songs. She was criticized by many, including [[Mohammed Zahur Khayyam|Khayyam]], for tampering with old melodies. Nevertheless, albums like ''Rahul And I'' became quite popular. In 1997, Asha did a private [[Indipop]] album ''Janam Samjha Karo'' with [[Lesle Lewis (composer)|Lesle Lewis]]. The album was hugely popular and won her many awards including the 1997 [[MTV]] Award.

Asha had been once asked by director [[B. R. Ishara]] to compose music for one of his films, but she had politely declined. In 2002, she turned music composer with the album ''Aap Ki Asha'', an eight-song music and video album. The lyrics were written by [[Majrooh Sultanpuri]]. The album was released by [[Sachin Tendulkar]] on 21 May 2001 at a lavish party in Mumbai. The album received mixed reviews.

Asha had spotted Pakistani singer [[Adnan Sami]]'s talent when he was about 10 years old. At that time, she was performing in London with R. D. Burman. It was she who had asked him to pursue his interests in music. When Adnan grew up and became a professional musician, Asha sang the title duet with him for his best-selling album ''Kabhi to nazar milao''. The two came together again in the album ''Barse Badal''. The album comprises eight songs, based on [[Indian Classical music]]. She contributed the song ''Yun Na Thi'' to the recording ''Womad Talking Book Volume Four: An Introduction to Asia 1'' on Womad Records.

Asha has sung [[ghazal]]s for many albums like ''Meraj-E-Ghazal'', ''[[Aabshar-e-Ghazal]]'' and ''Kashish''. In 2005, Asha released a self-titled album as a tribute to the four [[ghazal]] maestros&nbsp;– [[Mehdi Hassan]], [[Ghulam Ali (Ghazal singer)|Ghulam Ali]], [[Farida Khanum]] and [[Jagjit Singh]]. The album features eight of her favorite [[ghazal]]s like Farida Khanum's ''[[Aaj Jaane Ki Zid Na Karo]]'', [[Ghulam Ali (Ghazal singer)|Ghulam Ali]]'s ''Chupke Chupke'', ''Aawargi'' and ''Dil Mein Ek Lahar'', Jagjit Singh's ''Ahista Ahista'' and [[Mehdi Hassan]]'s ''Ranjish Hi Sahi'', ''Rafta Rafta'' and ''Mujhe Tum Nazar Se''. These classic ghazals were recreated with modern sounds by musician Pandit Somesh Mathur. The album was aimed at the younger generation, who, according to Asha, are "turned off" by the traditional sounds of tabla and sarangi.

Numerous compilations of Asha's songs have been released as well. To commemorate her 60th birthday, [[EMI]] India released three cassettes: ''Bala Main Bairagan Hoongi'' (devotional songs), ''The Golden Collection: Memorable Ghazals'' (non-film [[ghazal]]s by composers such as Ghulam Ali, R.D. Burman and Nazar Hussain), and ''The Golden Collection: The Ever Versatile Asha Bhosle'' (44 popular film songs).

In 1996, Asha Bhosle sang [[Channeache Rati]] among several other songs in Rajendra Talak's [[Konkani]] album ''Daryachya Deger'' with [[Suresh Wadkar]].

All these songs composed by Shamir Tandon were shot on video by journalist turned director [[S. Ramachandran (filmmaker)|S. Ramachandran]].

In 2014, she sang a song titled "Dil Lagane Ko Dil Jab" for the [[International Women's Day]] special album, ''[[Women's Day Special: Spreading Melodies Everywhere]]''. It was composed by Shamir Tandon and penned by Saajan Agarwal.

Asha's first husband Ganpatrao was her personal secretary. Their marriage failed miserably in 1960. Her husband and in-laws mistreated her. After a few years of marriage, Asha was turned out by a suspicious Ganpatrao<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harmonyindia.org/hportal/VirtualPageView.jsp?page_id=950|title=Only Asha: Asha Bhosle}}</ref> and she went to her maternal home with two children while pregnant with her third child.

Asha is an excellent cook and cooking is her favorite hobby. She often gets flooded with requests by Bollywood celebrities for ''kadai ghosht'' and ''[[biryani]]'' dishes and has rarely turned down a request. In fact, her ''paya [[curry]]'', ''[[Goa]]n fish curry'' and ''[[dal]]'' are very popular with the [[Kapoor family|Kapoor]] family of Bollywood. Once, when asked in a ''[[The Times of India]]'' interview, what if her singing career had not taken off, she said "I would have become a cook. I'd have cooked in four houses and made money." The love of cooking got Asha into a successful restaurant business. She runs [[restaurants]] in [[Dubai]] and [[Kuwait]] called Asha's. Asha's offers traditional north-western [[Indian cuisine]]. It has a presence in the Wafi City development in [[Dubai]], as well as three restaurants in [[Kuwait]], at [[The Avenues (Kuwait)|The Avenues Mall]], the Marina Mall and a brand new third outlet at the Spoons Complex. Other restaurants can be found in [[Abu Dhabi]]'s Khaldiya Mall, [[Doha]]'s Villagio and Bahrain's City Center Mall, with future outposts planned for Dubai's Mall of the Emirates and Cairo, Egypt. Asha Bhosle has a 20% stake in the business. Asha is not involved in the day-to-day running of the restaurant which is looked after by the Wafi Group. She takes care of the kitchen and the décor. She personally trained the [[chef]]s for almost six months. According to a December 2004 report in Menu Magazine,<ref>{{cite web

===Rivalry with Lata Mangeshkar===
Asha's [[sibling rivalry]] with [[Lata Mangeshkar]] is often talked about, in spite of their insistence that these are just tales.<ref name="Times_Life_Jul_2005"/> As young children, they were very close. As a child, Lata used to carry Asha all the time. They were so inseparable that when Lata went to school she would take Asha with her. One day the teacher protested and said that they cannot have two students on one fee. Lata refused to return to school without Asha and quit her studies.<ref name="ref_Kavita_Chhibber">

Lata considered Asha's act of eloping with her lover as irresponsible, leaving her alone to sing and earn for the family. This led to tensions between them. Asha herself stated in an interview<ref name="ref_Kavita_Chhibber" />&nbsp;– "It was a love marriage and Lata ''didi'' did not speak to me for a long time. She disapproved of the alliance." At one time, their relationship was very adversarial and there have been periods of non-communication.

In her initial days in the industry, Asha always played second fiddle to her elder sister. Some say that Lata had once criticised Asha's relationship with [[O. P. Nayyar]]. This widened the rift between the two sisters and O. P. Nayyar also decided that he would never work with Lata. O. P. Nayyar had once revealed that "Asha and Lata, staying in opposite flats at Bombay's [[Peddar Road]], shared a maid. Said maid's responsibility was to come and tell the younger sister that Lata had just recorded something wonderful for Asha to lose her vocal poise. Such was her Lata phobia that it took me some months to convince Asha that she had a voice individualistic enough to evolve a singing style all of her own."<ref name="Girija" /> Asha once said that she has worked for years to create a voice and a style that was different from Lata, so that she could carve her own niche and not be banished to live in her sister's shadow.<ref name="ref_Kavita_Chhibber" />

Asha and Lata have also sung together. Their first duet was for the film ''Daman'' (1951).<ref name="Girija" /> Some of their songs include "Man Bhawan Ke Ghar aye" (''[[Chori Chori]]'', 1956), "Sakhi ri sun bole papihaa us paar" (''[[Miss Mary (1957 film)|Miss Mary]]'', 1957), "O chand jahaan woh jayein" (''[[Sharada (1957 film)|Sharada]]'', 1957), "Mere Mehboob Mein Kya Nahi" (''[[Mere Mehboob]]'', 1963), "Unse Nazrein Mili" (''[[Gazal (1964 film)|Gazal]]'', 1964), "Ai kash kisi deewane ko" (''[[Aaye Din Bahar Ke]]'', 1966), "Jabse Laagi Toose Najariya" (''[[Shikar (1968 film)|Shikar, 1968]]''), "Main Haseena Nazneena Koi Mujhsa Nahi" ''([[Baazi (1968 film)|Baazi, 1968]])'', "Main Chali Main Chali" (''[[Padosan]]'', 1968), "Chhap tilak sab" (''[[Main Tulsi Tere Aangan Ki]]'', 1978), and "Man kyun behka" (''[[Utsav]]'', 1984). While singing, Lata used to hold her notebook in her right hand, while Asha held hers in the left hand. This meant Lata had her face away from Asha, making it difficult for them to "anticipate" each other.<ref name="ref_Kavita_Chhibber" />

The movie ''[[Saaz (film)|Saaz]]'' was supposedly based on Lata and Asha's rivalry.<ref>Archana Masih. [http://im.rediff.com/entertai/may/15saaz.htm Women of Substance]</ref> Asha said about the movie&nbsp;– "To have two women in long plaits, take a couple of incidents and exaggerate them into a 3-hour film is such a waste of time."<ref name="ref_Kavita_Chhibber" /> In the last few years, Asha and Lata have often been seen in public, enjoying each other's company. In an interview with ''[[The Times of India]]'', Asha once said&nbsp;– "I remember, sometimes both of us would be at a function and some industry types would ignore me and interact only with her, as if to prove their loyalty. Later, didi and I would have a good laugh!"

==In popular culture==
British [[alternative rock]] band [[Cornershop (band)|Cornershop]] released "[[Brimful of Asha]]" in 1997. The song, dedicated to Asha Bhosle, became an international hit single for the band and topped the [[UK Singles Chart]] in February 1998.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Brimful Of Asha meaning explained – Cornershop (Official Website)|url=https://www.cornershop.com/2012/01/brimful-explained|access-date=2020-09-03|language=en-US}}</ref> A number of remixes have been released as well, notably by [[Norman Cook]], also known as [[Fatboy Slim]].
