==History==
===Formation (1995)===

The Promise Ring were formed in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] from the aftermath of several [[Midwest emo]] groups<ref name=AMbio>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-promise-ring-mn0000855836/biography|title=The Promise Ring {{!}} Biography & History|publisher=AllMusic|author=Huey, Steve|access-date=June 26, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200326144527/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-promise-ring-mn0000855836/biography|archive-date=March 26, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> in February 1995: guitarists Jason Gnewikow and Matt Mangan (both formerly of None Left Standing), drummer Dan Didier and bassist Scott Beschta (both formerly of Ceilishrine).

After the ninth day of the tour, Cap'n Jazz broke up,<ref name=AVCoral/> and Bohlen was able to focus his time on the Promise Ring.<ref name=AMbio>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-promise-ring-mn0000855836/biography|title=The Promise Ring {{!}} Biography & History|publisher=AllMusic|author=Huey, Steve|access-date=June 26, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200326144527/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-promise-ring-mn0000855836/biography|archive-date=March 26, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Early releases and ''30° Everywhere'' (1996–1997)===

The band released a 7" vinyl single through Foresight Records, which contained the tracks "Watertown Plank" and "Mineral Point".<ref name=AMbio/> Foresight was owned by a friend of theirs.<ref name=JTPR /> The band then went on tour, performing in church halls and basements across the US.<ref name=JTPR>{{cite web|url=http://www.jadetree.com/band-promise.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990220020943/http://www.jadetree.com/band-promise.html|title=The Promise Ring|publisher=Jade Tree|archive-date=February 20, 1999|access-date=June 24, 2020}}</ref> [[Texas Is the Reason]] guitarist Norman Brannon acquired copies of the group's demo and 7" single and gave them to [[Jade Tree (record label)|Jade Tree]] co-founder Tim Own.<ref name=AVCoral/> Shortly afterwards, the band were signed to the independent label for a three-album contract.<ref name=Oxinterview00>{{cite web|url=https://www.ox-fanzine.de/interview/promise-ring-278|title=Promise Ring|work=Ox-Fanzine|author=Hiller, Joachim|date=September–November 2000|access-date=June 27, 2020|language=DE|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200627080407/https://www.ox-fanzine.de/interview/promise-ring-278|archive-date=June 27, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> After further touring at the start of 1996,<ref name=JTPR/> the ''Falsetto Keeps Time'' EP was released in February,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/release/falsetto-keeps-time-mr0002395749|title=Falsetto Keeps Time - The Promise Ring|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=June 29, 2020}}</ref> and was followed by a [[Split album|split single]] with Texas Is the Reason in May.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/release/the-promise-ring-texas-is-the-reason-mr0002283299|title=The Promise Ring/Texas Is the Reason - The Promise Ring / Texas Is the Reason|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=June 29, 2020}}</ref> Both releases were successful, with the band continuing to tour and work on material that would feature on their debut album.<ref name=JTPR/>

The Promise Ring's first studio album, titled ''[[30° Everywhere]]'', was released by Jade Tree in September 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/release/30%C2%B0-everywhere-mr0000070641|title=30° Everywhere - The Promise Ring|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=June 26, 2020}}</ref> Retrospectively, band members have voiced their dislike of the record; according to Bohlen, the album was recorded in only five days. The band additionally was confused about how they wanted to approach the music on the new record; Bohlen described the situation as one "where we had no idea what we wanted to do or how we wanted it to come out."<ref name=AVCoral /> Didier later spoke of his dislike of Casey Rice's engineering on the record, as well as Bohlen's illness during the recording: "it was the wrong recording at the wrong time with the wrong person."<ref name=AVCoral/> 

Despite this, the release was an underground success, earning the group attention from independent publications.<ref name=AMbio/> The attention was drawn and aided by the inclusion of "A Picture Postcard", which had earlier appeared on ''Falsetto Keeps Time'' and would go on to become a staple of the emo genre.<ref name=ViceRoom>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/599qyq/the-promise-ring-nothing-feels-good-1997-the-year-emo-broke|title=The Promise Ring's 'Nothing Feels Good' Proved There Was Room for Pop in Emo|work=Vice|author=Cepeda, Eduardo|date=August 31, 2017|access-date=June 26, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191207224654/https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/599qyq/the-promise-ring-nothing-feels-good-1997-the-year-emo-broke|archive-date=December 7, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The song again appeared as part of an EP titled ''[[The Horse Latitudes]]'', which effectively reissued the band's earlier work in early 1997.<ref name="AMbio" /> Although the band had 500–600 copies of ''30° Everywhere'' to sell over the course of several gigs, they managed to sell all the copies in one show when they reached [[CBGB's]].<ref name=AVCoral/> The band further promoted ''30° Everywhere'' starting with a six-week US tour with Texas Is the Reason,<ref name=JTPR/> followed by a European tour in April and May 1997.<ref name=JTPR/>

===''Nothing Feels Good'' (1997–1998)===

Immediately following the European tour's conclusion, the band began writing new material for their second album,<ref name=JTPR/> sometimes jamming for inspiration.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ox-fanzine.de/interview/promise-ring-278|title=Promise Ring|work=Ox-Fanzine|author=Hiller, Joachim|date=September–November 2000|access-date=June 27, 2020|language=DE|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200627080407/https://www.ox-fanzine.de/interview/promise-ring-278|archive-date=June 27, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The group went to Memphis, Tennessee and recorded the album, titled ''[[Nothing Feels Good]]'', at [[Easley McCain Recording]] with producer [[J. Robbins]] of [[Jawbox]].<ref name=JTPR />  The group opted for a cleaner, more [[Pop music|pop]]-oriented sound with the help of Robbins, which contrasted ''30° Everywhere'' and the [[punk rock]]-like approach Bohlen used in [[Cap'n Jazz]].<ref name=ViceRoom/> The relationship between Didier and Beschta throughout the sessions progressively deteriorated.<ref name=AVCoral/> Around the release of ''Nothing Feels Good'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/release/nothing-feels-good-mr0000079705|title=Nothing Feels Good - The Promise Ring|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=June 26, 2020}}</ref> Beschta was replaced by Tim Burton for the album's supporting tour. Burton was a former bandmate with Gnewikow in None Left Standing.<ref name=AMbio/> A music video was made for the album's fourth track, "Why Did Ever We Meet"; it was directed by [[Darren Doane]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tpr-online.com/faq_frame.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001018021425/http://www.tpr-online.com/faq_frame.html|title=FAQ|publisher=The Promise Ring|archive-date=October 18, 2000|access-date=June 24, 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref> Though the sessions were marked by turbulence, the album received excellent critical reception,<ref name=AMreview>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/nothing-feels-good-mw0000028977|title=Nothing Feels Good – The Promise Ring|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|author=Butler, Blake|access-date=February 3, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110070245/http://www.allmusic.com/album/nothing-feels-good-mw0000028977|archive-date=November 10, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=Oxreview>{{cite web|url=https://www.ox-fanzine.de/review/nothing-feels-good-cd-23521|title=Promise Ring Nothing feels good CD|work=Ox-Fanzine|author=Hiller, Joachim|date=1997|access-date=June 27, 2020|language=DE|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200623102242/https://www.ox-fanzine.de/review/nothing-feels-good-cd-23521|archive-date=June 23, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=PFreview>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/p/promise-ring/nothing-feels-good.shtml|title=Promise Ring: Nothing Feels Good|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=December 1997|access-date=February 3, 2017|last=Mirov|first=Nick|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030219090831/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/p/promise-ring/nothing-feels-good.shtml|archive-date=February 19, 2003|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=PNreview>{{cite web|url=https://www.punknews.org/review/10783/the-promise-ring-nothing-feels-good|title=The Promise Ring - Nothing Feels Good|publisher=Punknews.org|author=Pelone, Joe|date=December 9, 2011|access-date=June 23, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181231131008/https://www.punknews.org/review/10783/the-promise-ring-nothing-feels-good|archive-date=December 31, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> and was featured on best-of album lists for the year by the likes of ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Teen People]]''.<ref name="JTPR" />

In February 1998, the band were traveling back home from a show,<ref name=Salamon148>Salamon 1999, p. 148</ref> while on tour with [[Hum (band)|Hum]],<ref name=AVCoral/> in the midst of a snowstorm.<ref name=AMbio/> Their van flipped over after Bohlen hit a bump on the road;<ref name=Salamon148/> Bohlen flew head-first through the windshield. Bohlen (who had [[Head injury|head trauma]]), Burton (who had broken bones)<ref name=ViceRoom/> and Didier, were released from hospital the following morning. Gnewikow, however, was in the intensive care unit for three further weeks due to a broken collarbone and other injuries.<ref name=Salamon148/> Following the van accident, the band decided to replace their guitarist once again, hiring Scott Schoenbeck in favor of Burton.<ref name="AMbio" /> The band took a six-week break to recover from the van accident before resuming shows with [[Jimmy Eat World]] in the East Coast of the US,<ref name=AVCoral/> and a European stint with [[Jets to Brazil]]. The band again toured with Jets to Brazil across the US in October and Japan in November.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jadetree.com/news.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990221151512/http://www.jadetree.com/news.html|title=News|publisher=Jade Tree|archive-date=February 21, 1999|access-date=June 24, 2020}}</ref>

===''Boys + Girls'', ''Very Emergency'' and ''Electric Pink'' (1998–2001)===

In October 1998, the band released the ''Boys + Girls'' EP, which contained the two tracks "Tell Everyone We're Dead" and "Best Looking Boys".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/release/boys-girls-mr0000134385|title=Boys + Girl - The Promise Ring|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=June 24, 2020}}</ref> These two tracks showcased the band move in a more [[pop music|pop]]-oriented direction.<ref name=AMVEreview>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/very-emergency-mw0000256648|title=Very Emergency - The Promise Ring|publisher=AllMusic|author=Butler, Blake|access-date=June 24, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191112184057/https://www.allmusic.com/album/very-emergency-mw0000256648|archive-date=November 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In March 1999, the band performed new material during a few shows, leading up to their European tour that April.
