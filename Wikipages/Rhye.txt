==Members==
*[[Milosh|Michael Milosh]] was born in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]], and is an [[electronic music|electronic]] [[musician]] and vocalist. He is a classically trained cellist. He moved to Berlin, Germany to pursue music as a vocalist and a producer. Professionally using the name ''[[Milosh]]'', he signed with the record label [[Plug Research]] and released two albums, ''[[You Make Me Feel (Milosh album)|You Make Me Feel]]'' (2004), and ''Meme'' (2006). He also contributed the track "Then It Happened" to the [[Ghostly International]]/[[Williams Street]] album ''Ghostly Swim'', which was released in 2008.
*[[Robin Hannibal]] (born Robin Braun) was a member of the Danish duo [[Quadron]] together with Coco Maja Hastrup Karshøj. They were also signed to the Plug Research label and released a self-titled album in July 2009. Hannibal was also part of a Danish electronica collective called Boom Clap Bachelors, who in early 2008 released the album ''Just Before Your Lips''. He has collaborated with other artists such as Nobody Beats the Beats, [[Clemens (entertainer)|Clemens]], [[Jokeren]], and [[L.O.C. (rapper)|L.O.C.]]. Hannibal also launched two projects, Owusu & Hannibal and Parallel Dance Ensemble, and contributed to Szjerdene's "Lead the Way" and to Leon Ware's "Orchids for the Sun". In 2011, Quadron collaborated with American DJ and record producer [[Kaskade]] on the song "Waste Love" off his album ''[[Fire & Ice (Kaskade album)|Fire & Ice]]''.

==History==
In 2010, Hannibal was working on some Quadron material and got tipped off about Milosh's work through their common record label. He contacted Milosh, who was at the time living in Berlin, and asked him to fly to [[Copenhagen]], Denmark to meet him. The two musicians spent a week together in the studio recording three tracks for their first collaboration.

Eventually, Hannibal moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career there. As it happened, Milosh had also gone to the States independently. Based on their earlier cooperation in Denmark, the two agreed to continue working together, forming the duo Rhye, initially as an internet-based mystery, posting several singles online, but without providing any background information or contact details. Their online postings for "Open" and "The Fall", both romantic soul-pop numbers, garnered attention and a following. The songs were accompanied by sensual and high-quality shot videos.<ref name=NPR>{{cite web|title=Rhye: Men Of Mystery Find A Feminine Sound|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/03/02/173276751/rhye-men-of-mystery-find-a-feminine-sound|publisher=National Public Radio|access-date=6 March 2013}}</ref>

There was great interest as well as speculation amongst music journalists and reviewers about the group's identity. Discussions also ensued about Milosh's high and sigh-like [[contralto]] androgynous vocals.<ref name=guardian>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/07/rhye-woman-review|author=Dave Simpson|title=Rhye: Woman – review|newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 March 2013|access-date=15 March 2013}}</ref><ref name=NYT>{{cite news|last=Rosen|first=Jody|title=A Warm Croon Wrapped in an Enigma|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/arts/music/rhye-offers-a-warm-croon-wrapped-in-an-enigma.html?pagewanted=all|newspaper=New York Times|date=February 14, 2013}}</ref> His voice and the band's instrumentation are likened to those of British-Nigerian singer [[Sade Adu|Sade]]<ref name=NYT /> and [[The xx]].<ref name=pitchfork>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17693-rhye-woman/ |title=Rhye: Woman &#124; Album Reviews |website=Pitchfork |date=2013-03-05 |access-date=2013-05-06}}</ref>

In 2013, the band released its debut album, ''[[Woman (Rhye album)|Woman]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17693-rhye-woman/|title=Rhye: Woman Album Review {{!}} Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-05}}</ref>

During their 2014 tour, Rhye sold a poster printed for the Boston show containing cryptic text in [[Wingdings]] that read "Who is Rhye. [[Edward Bernays]]."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ollman|first1=Jonah|title=Mesme-Rhyezing|url=http://soundofboston.com/mesme-rhye-zing/|website=Sound of Boston|access-date=14 December 2016}}</ref>

In 2017, Rhye collaborated with [[Bonobo (musician)|Bonobo]] on a track called "Break Apart" from his album ''[[Migration (Bonobo album)|Migration]]''.

In June 2017, Rhye released the split single featuring the songs "Please" and "Summer Days".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.spin.com/2017/07/rhye-please-summer-days-listen/|title=Listen to Two New Songs from Rhye: "Please" and "Summer Days"|last=Cook-Wilson|first=Winston|date=2017-07-07|work=Spin|access-date=2017-07-08}}</ref>

In 2018, Rhye released their second album ''Blood'', to largely positive critical feedback.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.spin.com/2018/02/review-rhye-new-album-blood/|title=Review: Rhye – 'Blood'|date=2018-02-12|work=Spin|access-date=2018-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/rhye-blood-review|title=Rhye – 'Blood' album review|website=NME|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-05}}</ref> The cover art for the album features Milosh's naked girlfriend (a different woman from the one on the cover of ''Woman)''.
