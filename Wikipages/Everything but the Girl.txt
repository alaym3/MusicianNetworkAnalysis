'''Everything but the Girl''' (occasionally referred to as '''EBTG''') were an English [[musical duo]], formed in [[Kingston upon Hull]], England in 1982, consisting of lead singer and occasional guitarist [[Tracey Thorn]] and guitarist, keyboardist, producer and singer [[Ben Watt]]. Everything but the Girl has received eight [[gold record|gold]] and two [[platinum record|platinum]] album [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]] Certifications in the UK,<ref>{{cite web|title=BPI Certified Awards|url=https://www.bpi.co.uk/certified-awards.aspx|website=BPI|access-date=20 November 2016}}</ref> and one gold album [[RIAA]] Certification in the US.<ref>{{cite web|title=RIAA Gold Platinum|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum|website=RIAA|access-date=20 November 2016}}</ref> They had four top ten singles and twelve top forty singles in the UK.<ref name="Everything but the Girl">{{cite web|title=Everything but the Girl|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/20844/everything-but-the-girl/|website=Official Charts|access-date=20 November 2016}}</ref> Their biggest hit song "[[Missing (Everything but the Girl song)|Missing]]" charted high in several countries and reached number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1995 and spent over seven months on the UK Singles Chart thanks to an extremely popular remix by [[Todd Terry]] which later led to a [[Brit Award]] nomination for Best British Single.

The duo have also been nominated for [[MTV]], [[MTV Europe Music Award|EMA]] and [[Ivor Novello Award]]s and received an award from the BMI for sales of over 3 million in the UK alone.

Watt and Thorn are also a couple, though they are very private about their relationship and personal life. While their relationship started during their time at university, it was not a publicised fact that they were romantically involved, or that they had subsequently married.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/09/28/everything/ |title=Being Everything but the Girl |work=Salon.com |date=28 September 1999 |access-date=14 September 2015}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation and early years===
When Thorn and Watt met, they were both attending the [[University of Hull]] and both had contracted with the [[independent record label|independent record company]] [[Cherry Red Records]], as solo artists.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book

The pair each had solo album releases through Cherry Red: Thorn's 1982 LP was ''[[A Distant Shore (album)|A Distant Shore]]'', an eight-track mini-album. Watt's 1983 debut LP – the follow-up to his 1982 5-track EP ''Summer Into Winter'' featuring [[Robert Wyatt]] –  was entitled ''[[North Marine Drive]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

[[File:Turners 1985.JPG|thumb|right|350px|1985 view of Turners, with the slogan ''Everything but the Girl'']]

They formed a duo and adopted the name "Everything but the Girl" from the slogan used by the Hull shop Turner's Furniture<ref>{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Beverley+Road,+Kingston+upon+Hull,+United+Kingdom&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=50.644639,114.169922&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Beverley+Rd,+Hull,+United+Kingdom&ll=53.749444,-0.347214&spn=0.037253,0.111494&z=14&layer=c&cbll=53.749551,-0.347258&panoid=CI4nW1NHADCuZLgtBVAdjw&cbp=12,75,,0,-6.02 |title=Beverley Road, Kingston upon Hull, United Kingdom |publisher=Google Maps|date=1 January 1970|access-date= 11 May 2012}}</ref> on [[Beverley Road]].<ref name="AMG"/>

EBTG's debut single, a [[cover version]] of [[Cole Porter]]'s "[[Night and Day (song)|Night and Day]]", was released in June 1982.<ref name="AMG"/> After steady sales and exposure from a [[compilation album]] entitled ''[[Pillows & Prayers]]'', the single was re-issued in August 1983.

Their debut album, ''[[Eden (Everything but the Girl album)|Eden]]'', was released in the UK in 1984. It reached number 14 on the UK Albums Chart, spending twenty weeks on the chart.<ref name="Everything but the Girl"/> It featured the single "[[Each and Every One]]", which reached number 28 on the UK Top 40.<ref name="Everything but the Girl"/> Thorn wrote in 2016 that her lyric was misunderstood:

<blockquote>Our first single, "Each and Every One", was intended as an angry lyric about being a female musician, patronised and overlooked by male music critics. My band the [[Marine Girls]] had attracted several reviews along the lines of "not bad for a girl" and so the opening lines addressed this: "If you ever feel the time/To drop me a loving line/Maybe you should just think twice/I don’t wait around on your advice". It was the instructions of music critics I wasn’t waiting around for, but I wrote it too subtly, and so it was heard as a lovelorn lament, a lonely girl waiting for a letter from a boy.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mole |first=Media |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/feminism/2016/08/songs-i-write-are-usually-described-personal-me-they-re-political |title=The songs I write are usually described as "personal" – but for me they're political |website=Newstatesman.com |date=18 August 2016 |access-date=4 November 2016}}</ref></blockquote>

In spite of their early history as established independent artists, to newcomers Everything but the Girl was considered part of the jazz/popular music style known as "[[sophisti-pop]]", alongside other British acts like [[Carmel (band)|Carmel]], [[Swing Out Sister]], [[Sade (band)|Sade]], [[Matt Bianco]] and [[The Style Council]]. Both Watt and Thorn were guest musicians on the Style Council's ''[[Café Bleu]]'' album,<ref name="AMG"/> while EBTG worked with producer Robin Millar and [[audio engineering|engineers]] Ben Rogan and Mike Pela—who also collaborated with Sade—on their early albums.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Although ''Eden'' was released in the UK, a different recording, ''[[Everything but the Girl (album)|Everything but the Girl]]'', was released in the United States on the Sire label. The US release contains six tracks from ''Eden'', two UK singles and four alternate tracks.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The 1985 album ''[[Love Not Money]]'' was their second studio album release, and signalled a move away from jazz and Latin influences to a more traditional electric guitar, bass and drums arrangements. The US edition included two additional songs that were not on the original UK release: a cover version of [[The Pretenders]]' song "Kid" and "Heaven Help Me".{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The next year they released ''[[Baby, the Stars Shine Bright]]'', recorded with an orchestra at Abbey Road Studios.<ref name="AMG"/> They revealed the album's inspiration by their choices of [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] for its single releases: songs from [[Bacharach]] and [[Jimmy Webb]] on the [[Gramophone record|12"]] versions (as well as a cover version of [[Patsy Cline]]'s "[[I Fall to Pieces]]"). The first single from the album was "Come on Home," followed by "Don't Leave Me Behind."

In 1988, EBTG released ''[[Idlewild (Everything but the Girl album)|Idlewild]]''. Blending acoustic instrumentation with sequenced drums and synthesisers, it reached number 13 on the UK Albums Chart, spending fifteen weeks on the chart.<ref name="Everything but the Girl"/> A cover version of [[Danny Whitten]]'s "[[I Don't Want to Talk About It]]", previously a success for [[Rod Stewart]], was released as a single shortly afterwards. It reached Number 3 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]<ref name="Everything but the Girl"/> and was added to the latter issues of the album.<ref name="AMG"/> Around this time, [[Lloyd Cole and the Commotions]] asked Thorn to contribute vocals to the song "Big Snake" on their final studio album ''[[Mainstream (Lloyd Cole album)|Mainstream]]''.

Tommy Lipuma produced the band's 1990 album ''[[The Language of Life]]'', which featured the single "Driving."<ref name="AMG"/> "Driving" received heavy rotation on American adult alternative radio. The album featured a host of leading west coast session musicians including [[Omar Hakim]], [[Joe Sample]] and [[Michael Brecker]]. [[Stan Getz]] contributed a [[tenor saxophone|tenor sax]] solo on the song "The Road".<ref name="AMG"/>

In 1991, they released the self-produced album ''[[Worldwide (Everything but the Girl album)|Worldwide]]''. It charted at number 29 on the UK Albums Chart.<ref name="Everything but the Girl"/>

1992 saw the release of the acoustic ''Covers'' [[Extended play|EP]]. It reached Number 13 on the UK Top 40.<ref name="Everything but the Girl"/> The lead track was "[[Love Is Strange]]". It also included cover versions of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s "Tougher Than the Rest"; [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s "[[Time after Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time after Time]]" and [[Elvis Costello]]'s "[[Alison (song)|Alison]]".<ref name="AMG"/> These four tracks were included on the US only album, ''[[Acoustic (Everything but the Girl album)|Acoustic]]''.<ref name="AMG"/>

In the summer of 1992, the duo was forced to curtail [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] and [[concert tour|touring]] for several months when Watt developed [[eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis|Churg-Strauss syndrome]], a rare [[autoimmune]] disease. Hospitalised for 10 weeks, and enduring several life-saving operations, he subsequently wrote a memoir, ''[[Patient (memoir)|Patient]]'', about his near-death ordeal.

In 1993, EBTG released two EPs in the UK. One featured a cover version of [[Paul Simon]]'s "[[The Only Living Boy in New York]]". The other spawned a subsequent top ten UK Top 40 hit, "I Didn't Know I Was Looking For Love",<ref>{{cite web|title=Karen Ramirez|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/4309/karen-ramirez/|website=Official Charts|access-date=20 November 2016}}</ref> for [[Karen Ramirez]].

===Worldwide acclaim===
1994 saw EBTG release their seventh album, ''[[Amplified Heart]]'', a hybrid of [[folk rock]] and [[electronica]] featuring contributions from guitarist [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]], double bassist [[Danny Thompson]], drummer [[Dave Mattacks]], and producer/programmer [[John Coxon (musician)|John Coxon]]. Producer [[Todd Terry]] [[remix]]ed the track "[[Missing (Everything but the Girl song)|Missing]]", and when released as a single, it became an international success.<ref name="AMG"/> It reached the top ten around the world, including the US, where it peaked at No.&nbsp;2 in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="AMG"/>

While recording ''Amplified Heart'' Thorn and Watt wrote lyrics and music for two tracks – "Protection" and "Better Things" on [[Massive Attack]]'s second album ''[[Protection (Massive Attack album)|Protection]]''. Thorn sang lead vocals on both. The single "Protection" reached number 14 on the UK Top 40.<ref name="Massive Attack">{{cite web|title=Massive Attack|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/28023/massive-attack/|website=Official Charts|access-date=20 November 2016}}</ref> The album reached number 4 on the UK Albums Chart.<ref name="Massive Attack"/>

Buoyed by the recent successes and out of contract at WEA, EBTG released the self-produced ''[[Walking Wounded]]'' in 1996 exclusively licensed to [[Atlantic Records]] for the United States and Canada and  [[Virgin Records]] for the Rest of the World. Featuring collaborations with [[Spring Heel Jack]] and [[Howie B]] it ushered in a new electronic sound for their own work. It charted at number 4 on the UK Albums Chart and spawned two top ten UK Top 40 singles – "Walking Wounded" and "Wrong". Two further singles – "Single" and "Before Today" – reached number 20 and number 25 respectively.<ref name="Everything but the Girl"/>

In 1999, the duo followed it up with their last – and ninth – studio album, ''[[Temperamental (Everything but the Girl album)|Temperamental]]''. It charted at number 16 on the UK Albums Chart.<ref name="Everything but the Girl"/>

The duo performed their final show at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|title=Montreux Jazz Festival 2000|url=http://www.montreuxjazz.com/festival-2000|website=Montreux Jazz Festival|access-date=20 November 2016}}</ref>

There have been no new recordings from Everything but the Girl since 2000. In 2002, 2004 and 2005, the duo curated compilations of their material. The 2004 compilation, ''Like the Deserts Miss the Rain'', was a DVD release that included footage of a 1999 performance at the Forum venue in London, UK, for which [[John McKenzie (musician)|John McKenzie]] and long-time collaborator Martin Ditcham performed alongside the pair as session musicians.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

From 1999, Watt concentrated on DJ and production/[[remix]] work, finding success as one half of [[Ben Watt#Lazy Dog (1998–2003)|Lazy Dog]], with partner Jay Hannan, and collaborating with [[Beth Orton]] on her 1999 album ''[[Central Reservation (album)|Central Reservation]]'' and her 2002 album ''[[Daybreaker (Beth Orton album)|Daybreaker]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Beth Orton Re-Emerges On 'Daybreaker'|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/75470/beth-orton-re-emerges-on-daybreaker|website=Billboard.com|publisher=Billboard|access-date=19 July 2014|date=10 June 2002}}</ref> Watt then proceeded with a new angle on his solo career that included launching the Buzzin' Fly record label in 2003,<ref>{{cite web|first=Andy |last=Malt|title=Q&A: Ben Watt|url=http://www.completemusicupdate.com/article/qa-ben-watt/|website=Complete Music Update|publisher=UnLimited Media|access-date=19 July 2014|date=20 March 2013}}</ref> and becoming the part-owner-founder of the Neighbourhood and Cherry Jam nightclubs from 2002–2005.<ref name="Res">{{cite web|title=Ben Watt|url=http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/benwatt/biography|website=Resident Advisor|publisher=Resident Advisor Ltd|access-date=19 July 2014|year=2014}}</ref> Watt released a string of club-oriented productions including the ''Bright Star'' EP, with producer Stimming and British singer [[Julia Biel]], on Buzzin' Fly in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|first=Jean-Robert |last=Saintil|title=Stimming, Ben Watt & Julia Biel, Bright Star|url=http://www.littlewhiteearbuds.com/review/stimming-ben-watt-julia-biel-bright-star/#.U8pDt1b5lg0|website=Little White Earbuds|publisher=Littlewhiteearbuds.com|access-date=19 July 2014|date=29 April 2010}}</ref>

In 2005, Thorn co-wrote and recorded vocals for the song "Damage", a collaboration with German band [[Tiefschwarz]] that appeared on their ''[[Eat Books]]'' album. Thorn's second solo album, ''[[Out of the Woods (Tracey Thorn album)|Out of the Woods]]'', was then released in 2007,<ref>{{cite web|first=Michael |last=Histen|title=Tracey Thorn|url=http://michaelhisten.com/2k50/tag/tracey-thorn/|website=2k50: The 50 Best Songs of the Decade|publisher=Michael Histen|access-date=19 July 2014|year=2009}}</ref> followed by her third solo album, ''[[Love and Its Opposite]]'', in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mike |last=Orme|title=Tracey Thorn Love and Its Opposite|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14297-love-and-its-opposite/|website=Pitchfork|publisher=Pitchfork Media|access-date=19 July 2014|date=26 May 2010}}</ref> In October 2011, Thorn released a cover version of [[The xx]]'s "Night Time", on which Watt played guitar and sang backing vocals. This was their first recording together in over a decade, although it was not an Everything but the Girl release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchfork.com/news/44341-listen-everything-but-the-girl-reunite-to-cover-the-xxs-night-time/ |title=Listen: Everything but the Girl Reunite to Cover the xx's "Night Time" &#124; News |publisher=Pitchfork |date=18 October 2011 |access-date=18 April 2014}}</ref>

In an April 2011 interview, Thorn was asked whether she would ever work again with Watt as Everything but the Girl. Thorn responded, "Yes, we do keep saying we are nearly ready to maybe do some work together again. There are certain obstacles, some practical, some psychological, that we would need to overcome. But it may well happen."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisfakediy.co.uk/articles/interviews/tracey-thorn-i-dont-obsess-over-sleeves-or-vinyl |title=Tracey Thorn: 'I Don't Obsess Over Sleeves Or Vinyl' &#124; Interviews &#124; DIY |publisher=Thisisfakediy.co.uk |access-date=18 April 2014}}</ref> A collection of Christmas songs, ''Tinsel and Lights'', for which Thorn recorded cover versions of Christmas songs with two new original songs, was released in October 2012 on Buzzin' Fly's sister record label Strange Feeling.<ref>{{cite news|first=Alexis |last=Petridis|title=Tracey Thorn: Tinsel and Lights – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/oct/25/tracey-thorn-tinsel-and-lights-review|access-date=19 July 2014|work=The Guardian|date=25 October 2012}}</ref> Watt and the couple's children provided backing vocals on the original song "Joy".

In 2012, the band's first four albums were reissued by [[Demon Music Group|Edsel Records]] as "deluxe" [[double album|double CDs]], with demo recordings and other additional material. At the time, Watt explained that [[Warner Music Group]] still maintained control over their back catalogue: "our big fear was that one day we'd wake up and they'd have reissued them, without telling us."; when the representative from Edsel, a company that specialises in reissued material, made contact, the couple decided that the time was appropriate. Additionally, Thorn stated that the thought of reforming the band and playing live filled her "with cold dread"—upon re-listening to the early EBTG records, Thorn experienced a sense of "Gosh, well, I'm not really that person any more."<ref name="Laura">{{cite news|first=Laura |last=Barnett |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/17/everything-but-girl-early-albums-interview |title=Everything but the Girl: 'You feel like you're listening to a different person' &#124; Music |work= The Observer  |date=17 June 2012 |access-date=1 February 2013}}</ref>

A second tranche of Demon/Edsel reissues, covering the four albums released between 1990 and 1994, was announced in September 2013. According to the EBTG website, "Once again, Ben and Tracey have helped at every stage of the process, sourcing demos, rarities and memorabilia for the releases."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ebtg.com/ |title=Everything but the Girl |publisher=Ebtg.com |access-date=18 April 2014}}</ref>

The band's final two albums, ''Walking Wounded'' and ''Temperamental'' were given the deluxe treatment and were reissued by Demon/Edsel on 4 September 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ebtg.com/ |title=Everything but the Girl |publisher=Ebtg.com |access-date=4 September 2015}}</ref>

Watt hit the pause button on his record labels and DJ activities to return to his folk-jazz singer-songwriter roots in 2014. His first solo album since 1983, ''[[Hendra (Ben Watt album)|Hendra]]'' was released on 14 April 2014. It featured collaborations with [[Bernard Butler]], formerly of the band [[Suede (band)|Suede]], Berlin-based producer [[Ewan Pearson]] and [[David Gilmour]] of [[Pink Floyd]]. The album won the 'Best 'Difficult' Second Album' category at the AIM Independent Music Awards 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=AIM Awards 2014 – Full List Of Winners|url=http://clashmusic.com/news/aim-awards-2014-full-list-of-winners|website=Clash Music|access-date=20 November 2016}}</ref> It was included at No 27 in ''Uncut''{{'}}s Top 75 Albums of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Uncut Top 75 2014|url=http://www.albumoftheyear.org/list/306-uncuts-top-75-albums-of-2014/|website=Uncut|access-date=20 November 2016}}</ref> He followed it up in 2016 with ''[[Fever Dream (Ben Watt album)|Fever Dream]]''.  It continued his relationship with Bernard Butler, and added guest cameos from MC Taylor of North Carolina folk-rock band, [[Hiss Golden Messenger]], and Boston singer-songwriter [[Marissa Nadler]]. It received a 9/10 review in ''[[Uncut magazine|Uncut]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Uncut Fever Dream Reviews|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/reviews/album/ben-watt-fever-dream|website=Uncut|access-date=20 November 2016}}</ref> In a four-star review, ''[[The Guardian]]'' said: 'In his early 50s, he is making some of the best music of his career.'<ref>{{cite news|first=Dave |last=Simpson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/07/ben-watt-fever-dream-review |title=Ben Watt: Fever Dream review – keen-eyed songs about human relationships &#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=2016-05-20}}</ref>

In addition to solo music projects, both Thorn and Watt have each written two books. Thorn's 2013 memoir, ''Bedsit Disco Queen'', covers a significant portion of the history of EBTG as a band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/10/bedsit-disco-queen-thorn-review/ |title=Bedsit Disco Queen by Tracey Thorn – review |work=The Guardian |date=10 February 2013 |access-date=30 November 2015}}</ref>
