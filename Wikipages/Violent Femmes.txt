'''Violent Femmes''' are an American [[folk punk]] band from [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]. The band consists of founding members [[Gordon Gano]] (guitar, lead vocals) and [[Brian Ritchie]] (bass, backing vocals), joined by multi-instrumentalist [[Blaise Garza]] (joined 2004), and drummer John Sparrow (joined 2016).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://americansongwriter.com/violent-femmes-hotel-last-resort/hal-horowitz/|title=Violent Femmes: Hotel Last Resort|website=American Songwriter|date=July 25, 2019|access-date=November 9, 2019}}</ref>  Former members of the band include drummers [[Victor DeLorenzo]] (1980–1993, 2002–2013), [[Guy Hoffman]] (1993–2002), and [[Brian Viglione]] (2013–2016).

Violent Femmes have released ten studio albums and 15 singles during the course of their career. The band found immediate success with the release of their [[Violent Femmes (album)|self-titled debut album]] in early 1983. Featuring many of their well-known songs, including "[[Blister in the Sun]]", "Kiss Off", "[[Add It Up]]" and "[[Gone Daddy Gone]]", ''Violent Femmes'' became the band's biggest-selling album and was eventually certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&title=violent_femmes&artist=violent_femmes&perPage=25 |title=RIAA Gold & Platinum Database |date=February 1, 1991 |access-date=February 20, 2011}}</ref> Violent Femmes went on to become one of the most successful alternative rock bands of the 1980s, selling more than 9 million albums by 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mio.co.za/article/sa-is-set-to-be-rocked-2005-09-13 |title=SA is set to be rocked  |website=[[Music Industry Online]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213185251/http://www.mio.co.za/article/sa-is-set-to-be-rocked-2005-09-13 |archive-date=December 13, 2013}}</ref> After the release of their third album ''[[The Blind Leading the Naked]]'' (1986), the band's future was uncertain and they split up in 1987, when Gano and Ritchie went solo. However, they regrouped a year later, releasing the album ''[[3 (Violent Femmes album)|3]]'' (1989).  Their fifth album ''[[Why Do Birds Sing?]]'' (1991) contains the fan favorite and concert staple "American Music".  In 1993, founding drummer Victor DeLorenzo left the band, and the band released the compilation album ''[[Add It Up (1981–1993)]]'', while their 1994 album ''[[New Times (album)|New Times]]'' introduce new drummer Guy Hoffman to the lineup.  A number of albums were released with this lineup throughout the 1990s, then DeLorenzo rejoined the band in 2002 for what was to be a farewell tour.  The band stopped releasing new albums, though a number of compilation albums were released in the early 2000s, along with a few one-off songs.  Some controversy over the licensing of the band's songs for commercial use led to an official break-up in 2009, though the band re-formed in 2013, and have since released two more studio albums of new material: ''[[We Can Do Anything]]'' (2016) and ''[[Hotel Last Resort]]'' (2019).

==History==
===Early years and first album (1981–1983)===
Violent Femmes were founded by bassist [[Brian Ritchie]] and percussionist [[Victor DeLorenzo]] following the demise of the initial wave of American [[punk rock]], and became a full-fledged band upon the arrival of lead vocalist and guitarist [[Gordon Gano]]. According to Ritchie, he came up with the name of the group as a fake band name when one of his bandmates questioned his assertion that his brother was also in a band—he and DeLorenzo liked the name, so they used it for the rhythm duo in which they played prior to Gano joining the group.<ref name=rockzone>{{cite web|last=Barker|first=Rayanna|title=A Conversation With Brian Ritchie|url=http://www.rockzone.com/interviews/femmes.shtml|website=Rockzone.com|access-date=July 17, 2013}}</ref> In its early days, the band frequently played coffee houses and street corners. They were discovered by [[James Honeyman-Scott]] (of [[the Pretenders]]) on August 23, 1981, when the band was [[busking]] on a street corner in front of the [[Oriental Theatre (Milwaukee)|Oriental Theatre]], the Milwaukee venue that the Pretenders would be playing later that night. [[Chrissie Hynde]] invited them to play a brief acoustic set after the opening act.<ref>''Milwaukee Journal'' August 24, 1981</ref>

===Later years and brief split (1984–1992)===
[[File:Violentfemmessydney90.png|thumb|left|1990 at Sydney Opera House]]
After their debut album ''[[Violent Femmes (album)|Violent Femmes]]'', the band released ''[[Hallowed Ground (Violent Femmes album)|Hallowed Ground]]'', which moved the group toward a [[country music]] sound and introduced Christian themes. Mark Van Hecke produced the band's first two efforts,<ref name="allmusic1">{{cite web|last=Mark VanHecke |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/mark-vanhecke-mn0000332664/credits |title=Mark VanHecke &#124; Credits |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=September 12, 2016}}</ref> but their third album, ''[[The Blind Leading the Naked]]'', saw a change in the studio. This time, another fellow Milwaukee native, [[Jerry Harrison]] of [[Talking Heads]], did the producing. It was more mainstream and pop-oriented, resulting in a minor hit with "[[Children of the Revolution (song)|Children of the Revolution]]", originally by [[T.Rex (band)|T.Rex]].<ref name="Larkin80">{{cite book|title=The Virgin Encyclopedia of Eighties Music|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2003|edition=Third|isbn=1-85227-969-9|page=484|title-link=Encyclopedia of Popular Music}}</ref> In 1985, Van Hecke ended his collaboration with the group and became a composer and producer in the rapidly growing video game industry. He would return later to produce two more albums for the group.<ref name="allmusic1"/> The Femmes briefly disbanded, with Gano releasing an album in 1987, the result of a [[gospel music|gospel]] side project Mercy Seat. Ritchie also released several solo LPs. The group came back together in late 1988, releasing ''[[3 (Violent Femmes album)|3]]'', a return to the band's earlier, stripped-down sound.<ref name="Larkin80"/> ''[[Why Do Birds Sing?]]'' was released in 1991 after the band signed to [[Reprise Records|Reprise]]<ref name="Larkin80"/> and featured another minor hit, "American Music," which became a concert staple.

===Post-DeLorenzo years (1993–1998)===
In 1993, DeLorenzo departed the group to act and make solo records. [[Guy Hoffman]], formerly of the [[Oil Tasters]] and [[BoDeans]], was brought in to tour what was to become one of the Violent Femmes' biggest-selling records, the ''[[Add It Up (1981–1993)]]'' collection. Over the next nine years, the band, with Hoffman, recorded five full-length CDs and a handful of one-offs for motion picture soundtracks, such as "I Swear It (I Can Change)" from the [[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut (soundtrack)|''South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut'' soundtrack]], "Color Me Once" for the [[The Crow (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]'' and other compilation projects. The first full studio album with Hoffman on drums, ''[[New Times (album)|New Times]]'' ([[Elektra Records]]), was released in 1994, and the band scored another minor hit with the song "Breakin' Up". ''[[Rock!!!!!]]'' ([[Mushroom Records]]) was released in 1995 in Australia only, though it has since become available in the United States.

===Later years and reunion with DeLorenzo (1999–2006)===
''[[Viva Wisconsin]]'', a live album, was released in the United States in 1999 on the independent label [[Beyond (record label)|Beyond]] and was followed by ''[[Freak Magnet]]'' in 2000. ''[[Something's Wrong (album)|Something's Wrong]]'' (2001), an album of unreleased studio tracks, covers, demos and acoustic live performances was released as an MP3-only album through [[eMusic]]. In 2002, Rhino Records repackaged the band's 1983 debut <!-- do not change this to 1982 --> album, along with [[Demo (music)|demos]] and live tracks, to coincide with a 20th-anniversary reissue. DeLorenzo asked to rejoin for what was to be a farewell tour, thus reinstating the original lineup.

For the 2002 ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' First Complete Season DVD, the Violent Femmes recorded a 34-second cover of the ''SpongeBob'' theme. They also recorded a 30-second commercial for [[Nickelodeon]].

2005 saw the release of two collections of past work—a CD called ''[[Permanent Record: The Very Best of Violent Femmes]]'' on [[Slash Records|Slash]]/[[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino]] and a DVD, ''[[Permanent Record – Live & Otherwise]]'' from [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino]], which showcases a concert performance from 1991, along with many of the group's [[Music video|videos]]. The CD is the first release that recognizes all four musicians and their contributions on the same disc.

After touring in promotion of ''[[Freak Magnet]]'', primary songwriter Gano decided that the band would no longer make new music, but would continue to play shows when booked. On New Year's Eve of 2005, and for one show in January 2006, all four Violent Femmes members played together.

===Lawsuit and disbanding (2007–2009)===
In 2007, Gano angered Ritchie by selling advertising rights for the classic "[[Blister in the Sun]]" to [[Wendy's]].

Although nearly all of the band's songs, including "Blister in the Sun," credit Gano as the sole songwriter, Ritchie responded to the use of the song in the commercial by saying:
<blockquote>
"For the fans who rightfully are complaining about the Wendy's burger advertisement featuring "Blister in the Sun," Gordon Gano is the publisher of the song and Warners is the record company. When they agree to use it there's nothing the rest of the band can do about it, because we don't own the song or the recording. That's showbiz. Therefore when you see dubious or in this case disgusting uses of our music you can thank the greed, insensitivity and poor taste of Gordon Gano, it is his karma that he lost his songwriting ability many years ago, probably due to his own lack of self-respect as his willingness to prostitute our songs demonstrates. Neither Gordon (vegetarian) nor me (gourmet) eat garbage like Wendy's burgers. I can't endorse them because I disagree with corporate food on culinary, political, health, economic and environmental grounds. However, I see my life's work trivialized at the hands of my business partner over and over again, although I have raised my objections numerous times. As disgusted as you are I am more so."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onmilwaukee.com/music/soundcheck/articles/femmeschili2.html|title=Femmes' Ritchie reacts to Wendy's chili {{sic|comme|rical|nolink=y}} controversy|website=Onmuilwaukee.com|date=March 6, 2007|access-date=November 9, 2019}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Ritchie filed a lawsuit against Gano in August 2007, seeking half ownership of Violent Femmes' music and access to royalty accounting.<ref>{{cite web|title=Violent Femmes Embroiled In Inter-Band Lawsuit|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1049850/violent-femmes-embroiled-in-inter-band-lawsuit|website=Billboard|access-date=July 10, 2016}}</ref> Many speculated this would lead to the band's breakup. However, on June 17, 2008, the band released a cover of "[[Crazy (Gnarls Barkley song)|Crazy]]" by [[Gnarls Barkley]], who had previously covered "[[Gone Daddy Gone]]".

The band disbanded in 2009 as a result of Ritchie's lawsuit against Gano.<ref name="musicau">{{cite web|url=http://themusic.com.au/news/all/2013/01/25/grinderman-reform-for-coachella/ |title=Grinderman reform for Coachella |website=Themusic.com.au|date=January 25, 2013 |access-date=January 26, 2013}}</ref>

== Horns of Dilemma ==
In their shows, the Femmes employ a horn section called the Horns of Dilemma. For many years, it consisted of Peter Balestrieri, [[Steve MacKay]] on saxophones and [[Sigmund Snopek III]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sigmundsnopek.com/|title=SigmundSnopek.com – Welcome to the Official Web Site of Sigmund Snopek III|website=SigmundSnopek.com|access-date=October 14, 2014}}</ref> on keyboards and other instruments.<ref name="Peter Balestrieri">{{cite web|last=Cohn|first=Yale|title=Talking With: Peter Balestrieri of the Violent Femmes |url=http://patv.tv/blog/2013/01/23/talking-with-peter-balestrieri-of-the-violent-femmes/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319005921/http://patv.tv/blog/2013/01/23/talking-with-peter-balestrieri-of-the-violent-femmes/ |archive-date=March 19, 2016}}</ref> It was augmented by various musicians who the band invited to play with them. The band now uses local acquaintances, famous or otherwise, friends, relatives or associates of the band, particularly their [[road crew]]. Instrumentation varies widely and includes saxophones, trumpets, trombones, [[sousaphone]], flute, clarinet, antique hunting horn, kazoo and percussion. The group doesn't back up the band in the way that a traditional horn section would; instead, they provide a free-form noise jam. When the band plays "Black Girls" or "Confessions", the only direction given to the players is to play freely and as wildly as possible during certain sections. Currently, the leader of the Horns of Dilemma is [[Blaise Garza]], who plays saxophone. Famous members have included [[John Zorn]], [[Dick Parry]] and [[the Dresden Dolls]]. Longtime band associates and employees who have played with the Horns include soundman Caleb Alexander and manager Darren Brown.<ref name="Horns of Dilemma">{{cite web|title=Horns of Dilemma|url=http://www.vfemmes.com/horns.html|publisher=Violent Femmes|access-date=May 23, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523054003/http://www.vfemmes.com/horns.html|archive-date=May 23, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Before becoming the band's drummer, John Sparrow played [[cajón]], starting in 2005.<ref name="Setting aside strife">{{cite news|last=Levy|first=Piet|title=Setting aside strife, Milwaukee's Violent Femmes reborn |url=http://archive.jsonline.com/entertainment/musicandnightlife/setting-aside-strife-milwaukees-violent-femmes-reborn-b99674230z1-370282691.html|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|access-date=July 22, 2017}}</ref> Various bassists stand in for Ritchie during "Gone Daddy Gone," when he plays xylophone.
