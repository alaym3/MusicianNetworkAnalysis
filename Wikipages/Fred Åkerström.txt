'''Fred Åkerström''' (27 January 1937 – 9 August 1985) was a Swedish [[Folk music|folk]] guitarist and singer particularly noted for his interpretations of [[Carl Michael Bellman]]'s music, and his own work of the typically Swedish song segment named ''visa''. These songs, ''visor'', are traditionally very narrative and the performance is "acted" to some degree. The singer is in context a ''vissångare'', a [[troubadour]] character. Åkerström was also known for his actor's interpretations of Bellman's 18th century material, and his unusual ability to reach deep bass notes (especially on his interpretation of Bellman's song ''[[Glimmande nymf]]'').

==Life==
Åkerström was born in Stockholm to a family of meager circumstances, which would later influence the social, economic, and political criticisms found in many of his works and public appearances. He may have aspired at an early age to become a ''vissångare,'' being a devoted listener to Ruben Nilson. After performances at the famous ''vispråmen "Storken,"'' he released his first record in 1963, ''Fred Åkerström sjunger Ruben Nilson.'' He was a contemporary of [[Cornelis Vreeswijk]], and the two were at times very close, touring together and releasing a joint record, early in their careers.<ref name="SvD">{{cite news |title=Krokig väg mot debut för Fred Åkerström |url=https://www.svd.se/krokig-vag-mot-debut-for-fred-akerstrom |access-date=26 May 2019 |work=[[Svenska Dagbladet]] |language=sv}}</ref> He became an alcoholic in later life.

===Bellman interpreter===
{{further|Carl Michael Bellman}}

Åkerström believed that Bellman had been misinterpreted by an earlier generation of artists: far from being a jolly and romantic person, Bellman was, Åkerström thought, an accurate social reporter of poverty, sickness, death and suffering.<ref name="Alba">{{cite web |last1=Wilehag |first1=Leif |title=En helt igenom nordisk vissångare |trans-title=A through and through Nordic ''visa''-singer |url=https://www.alba.nu/sidor/26740 |website=Alba.nu |access-date=26 May 2019 |language=sv |year=2014}}</ref> Like Vreeswijk, Åkerström was a major interpreter of [[Carl Michael Bellman]]'s songs, giving them "a new and more powerful expression" than they had had before, starting with his live performance of one of ''[[Fredman's Epistles]]'', "[[Nå skruva fiolen]]" in 1964. He published ten albums containing Bellman songs, of which three were dedicated to that subject: ''[[Fred sjunger Bellman]]'' in 1969; ''[[Glimmande nymf (album)|Glimmande nymf]]'' in 1974; and ''[[Vila vid denna källa (album)|Vila vid denna källa]]'' in 1977. His performances increased in intensity until it seemed to audience and critics that Åkerström was identifying himself with Bellman.<ref name="Nilsson">{{cite web |last1=Nilsson |first1=Hans |title=BELLMAN PÅ SPÅREN |trans-title=Bellman Recordings |url=http://www.bellman.net/artiklar/sparen.html |publisher=Bellman.net |access-date=26 May 2019 |language=sv}}</ref><ref name="Aftonbladet">{{cite news |last1=Holmqvist |first1=Kalle |title=Visor och revolution |url=https://www.aftonbladet.se/kultur/bokrecensioner/a/xR944l/visor-och-revolution |work=[[Aftonbladet]] |date=20 June 2014 |language=sv |quote=Fred Åkerström lämnade snart KFML(r) och återvände till nöjets estrader där han gjorde succé med sånger av Bellman.}}</ref> In his book ''Ingenstans fri som en fågel'',<ref name="Mosskin 2014">{{cite book |last1=Mosskin |first1=Peter |title=Fred Åkerström : ingenstans fri som en fågel : en biografi |trans-title=Nowhere free as a bird |date=2014 |isbn=978-9113055930 |language=sv}}</ref> Peter Mosskin wrote of Åkerström that no-one in two hundred years had succeeded better at bringing Bellman to life, making the story of his music an important element in Swedish cultural history.<ref name="Aftonbladet"/> His later Bellman recordings combined his guitar with cello and flute.<ref name="Sydsvenskan">{{cite news |last1=Lind |first1=Kalle |title=Böcker {{!}} Fred på jorden |url=https://www.sydsvenskan.se/2014-06-02/fred-pa-jorden |work=[[Sydsvenskan]] |date=2 June 2014 |language=sv}}</ref>
