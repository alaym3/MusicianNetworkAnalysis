'''Andrew Maurice Gold''' (August 2, 1951 – June 3, 2011) was an American multi-instrumentalist, singer, songwriter, and record producer who influenced much of the Los Angeles-dominated [[pop rock|pop]]/[[soft rock]] sound in the 1970s.<ref name="NYT">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/07/arts/music/andrew-gold-singer-and-songwriter-dies-at-59.html |title=Andrew Gold, Singer and songwriter, Dies at 59 |first=Paul |last=Vitello |date=June 7, 2011 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> Gold played on scores of records by other artists, most notably [[Linda Ronstadt]]'s, and had his own success with the U.S. [[top 40]] hits "[[Lonely Boy (Andrew Gold song)|Lonely Boy]]" (1977) and "[[Thank You for Being a Friend]]" (1978), as well as the [[UK Singles Chart|UK top five]] hit "[[Never Let Her Slip Away]]" (1978). In the 1980s, he had further international chart success as one half of [[Wax (UK band)|Wax]], a collaboration with [[10cc]]'s [[Graham Gouldman]].

During the 1990s, Gold produced, composed, performed on and wrote tracks for films, commercials, and television soundtracks, such as "Final Frontier", the theme of the sitcom ''[[Mad About You]]''. Some of his older works later experienced newfound popularity: "Thank You for Being a Friend" was used as the opening theme for ''[[The Golden Girls]]'', and the children's novelty song "Spooky Scary Skeletons" (1996) became an [[Internet meme]] in the 2010s. In 1997, Gold released a tribute to 1960s [[psychedelic music]], ''Greetings from Planet Love'', issued under the pseudonym "the Fraternal Order of the All".<ref name="Leigh">[[Spencer Leigh (radio presenter)|Leigh, Spencer]].

==Early life==
Gold was born on August 2, 1951 in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], California,<ref name="NYT"/><ref name="Tel obit">[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8564373/Andrew-Gold.html Obituary], ''Telegraph'', June 8, 2011.</ref> and eventually followed his parents into show business. His mother was singer [[Marni Nixon]], who provided the singing voice for numerous actresses, notably [[Natalie Wood]] in ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'', [[Deborah Kerr]] in ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'', and [[Audrey Hepburn]] in ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]''; his father was [[Ernest Gold (composer)|Ernest Gold]], an Austrian-born composer who won an [[Academy Award]] for his score for the movie ''[[Exodus (1960 film)|Exodus]]''.<ref name=latimes>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-andrew-gold-20110606-story.html|title=Andrew Gold dies at 59; musician, songwriter, arranger|date=June 6, 2011|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> He had two younger sisters.

Gold began writing songs at the age of 13. While in school in the [[United Kingdom]], the 16-year-old Gold scored his first recording contract on the strength of a selection of demos he submitted to Polydor Records' [[London]] office. That contract resulted in the single "Of All the Little Girls", which was recorded with his friend and collaborator Charlie Villiers, and released in 1967 under the name Villiers and Gold.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.andrewgold.com/|title=HOME|website=Andrewgold.com}}</ref>

==Career==
===1970–1979===
By the early 1970s, Gold was working full-time as a musician, songwriter and record producer. He was a member of the Los Angeles band [[Bryndle]], alongside [[Kenny Edwards]], [[Wendy Waldman (songwriter)|Wendy Waldman]] and [[Karla Bonoff]], releasing the single "Woke Up This Morning" in 1970. He played a major role as multi-instrumentalist and arranger for [[Linda Ronstadt]]'s breakthrough album, 1974's ''[[Heart Like a Wheel]]'', and her next two albums. After Ronstadt's ''[[Hasten Down the Wind]]'', Gold began a career as a solo artist. Among other accomplishments, he played the majority of instruments on "[[You're No Good]]", Ronstadt's only No. 1 single on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and on "[[When Will I Be Loved (song)|When Will I Be Loved]]", "[[(Love Is Like a) Heat Wave]]", and many other hits. He was in her band from 1973 until 1977, and then sporadically throughout the 1980s and 1990s, performing at some of her concerts.

In 1975, Gold debuted as a solo artist, with the album ''[[Andrew Gold (album)|Andrew Gold]]'', and played most of the instruments on [[Art Garfunkel]]'s solo hit "[[I Only Have Eyes For You]]" (which was a major hit in the United Kingdom, where it topped the [[UK Singles Chart]]), as well as several other cuts on Garfunkel's album ''[[Breakaway (Art Garfunkel album)|Breakaway]]''.

Gold's second studio album, ''[[What's Wrong with This Picture? (Andrew Gold album)|What's Wrong with This Picture?]]'', was released in 1976 and featured the hit single "Lonely Boy", which reached No. 7 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in June 1977.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100|title=Top 100 Songs &#124; Billboard Hot 100 Chart|website=Billboard.com}}</ref>

In 1977, Gold also played guitar on two cuts of [[Eric Carmen]]'s album ''[[Boats Against the Current]]'', including "[[She Did It]]", a No. 23 hit that year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.songfacts.com/facts/eric-carmen/she-did-it|title=She Did It by Eric Carmen – Songfacts|website=Songfacts.com}}</ref>

Although "Lonely Boy" was the bigger radio hit in the States, the single "[[Thank You for Being a Friend]]" from Gold's third album, ''[[All This and Heaven Too (album)|All This and Heaven Too]]'', peaked at No. 25 in 1978,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EW9RsB0a0oAC&q=joel+whitburn|title=The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits|first=Joel|last=Whitburn|date=October 11, 2010|publisher=Billboard Books|isbn=9780823085545|via=Google Books}}</ref> later gaining popularity as the theme song for ''[[The Golden Girls]]'', performed by Cindy Fee.

Gold's biggest hit in the United Kingdom was "[[Never Let Her Slip Away]]", which peaked at number five on the [[UK Singles Chart]] on two occasions, firstly by Gold himself in 1978 and again by dance-pop group [[Undercover (dance group)|Undercover]] in 1992. [[Freddie Mercury]],<!--ACCORDING TO MULTIPLE RELIABLE SOURCES, FREDDIE MERCURY PERFORMED AS AN UNCREDITED BACKGROUND SINGER.

Gold also toured with the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], worked in the studio and toured with Ronstadt and [[Jackson Browne]], recorded and toured with [[James Taylor]], and was second engineer on part of [[Joni Mitchell]]'s album ''Blue''.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2011-06-08|title=Andrew Gold: Musician and songwriter whose collaborators included|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/andrew-gold-musician-and-songwriter-whose-collaborators-included-ronstadt-garfunkel-and-cher-2294196.html|access-date=2020-11-28|website=The Independent|language=en}}</ref>

===1980–2021===
In 1981, Gold produced, co-wrote, sang and played on three [[10cc]] tracks that appeared on the hit-making pop-rock band's 1981 album ''[[Ten Out of 10]]''. Subsequently, [[Eric Stewart]] and [[Graham Gouldman]] of 10cc invited Gold to become a member of the group. Although he had worked with them in the studio, business conflicts prevented him from joining their ranks. In late 1983, 10cc broke up, and in the aftermath, Gold and Gouldman formed [[Wax (UK band)|Wax]]. Wax recorded and toured for five years. They enjoyed international success, particularly in the UK, where the duo had several hits including "[[Right Between the Eyes (Wax song)|Right Between the Eyes]]" and their biggest hit, "[[Bridge to Your Heart]]". Wax broke up as a recording and touring entity in 1989, but Gold and Gouldman continued to write and record together whenever possible.

Gold played on Cher's hit 1989 album ''[[Heart of Stone (Cher album)|Heart of Stone]]'' and, during the early '90s, wrote and composed hits for [[Trisha Yearwood]] as well as [[Wynonna Judd]], for whom he co-wrote the No. 1 single "[[I Saw the Light (Wynonna Judd song)|I Saw The Light]]" with [[Lisa Angelle]]. (Later, Gold would produce Angelle on her own album, which featured a number of songs on whose authorship and composition they collaborated.) He also produced singles for [[Vince Gill]], wrote and produced tracks for [[Celine Dion]], and arranged a cover of the [[Everly Brothers]]' hit "All I Have to Do Is Dream" that was sung by stars [[Jeff Bridges]] and [[Karen Allen]] in the 1984 science-fiction film ''[[Starman (film)|Starman]].''

In the 1990s, Gold once again joined forces with ex-bandmates Karla Bonoff, Wendy Waldman and Kenny Edwards to re-form Bryndle and release their first full-length album, ''Bryndle.'' In 1996, Gold left Bryndle and released the children's [[Halloween]]-oriented novelty album ''Halloween Howls'' with [[John Waite]], featuring the track "Spooky Scary Skeletons". The same year, he released the solo album ''....Since 1951,'' and produced Stephen Bishop's ''Blue Guitar'' album. Thereafter, he recorded the psychedelic '60s tribute album ''Greetings from Planet Love'' under the pseudonym "The Fraternal Order of the All," releasing it on his own record label, "QBrain Records." This album was a multi-tracked solo affair with Gold essentially playing all of the instruments and singing all of the vocals on original songs in the style of Gold's favorite 1960s bands such as [[The Beatles]], [[The Byrds]] and [[The Beach Boys]]. He produced, composed, and/or wrote tracks for numerous films, such as the comedy ''Rectuma'' from director [[Mark Pirro]], and contributed songs to many television soundtracks and commercials. Among his more high-profile gigs, he sang "Final Frontier," the theme song for the television sitcom ''[[Mad About You]]''. In a remarkable turn of events, his rendition of the song was used as the wake-up call for the [[Mars Pathfinder]] space probe in 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mars.nasa.gov/MPF/|title=Mars Pathfinder|website=Mars.nasa.gov}}</ref> Gold also produced seven albums for Japanese singer-songwriter [[Eikichi Yazawa]].

In 2000, Gold compiled a Wax rarities album, ''House of Wax on Wax'', as well as recording and releasing a new solo album ''The Spence Manor Suite;'' this last was followed in 2002 by another solo collection, ''Intermission''. In the early 2000s, he formed a Byrds tribute band, Byrds of a Feather, which performed in the Los Angeles area. He appeared in a 2006 concert with the classic rock group [[America (band)|America]], and singer-songwriter [[Stephen Bishop (singer)|Stephen Bishop]], and the performance was later released as a DVD titled ''America And Friends – Live at the Ventura Theater''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/live-at-the-ventura-theatre-mw0000388891|title=Live at the Ventura Theatre – America, America And Friends &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> The show featured Gold performing "Thank You for Being a Friend," "Final Frontier," "Bridge to Your Heart" and "Lonely Boy," as well as accompanying America and Bishop on guitar and vocals. Gold had earlier produced America's ''Holiday Harmony'' Christmas album back in 2002,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/holiday-harmony-mw0000229580|title=Holiday Harmony – America &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> wherein he also played most of the instruments and co-wrote the track "Christmas in California."

In the early 2010s, Gold's song "Spooky Scary Skeletons" became the subject of Halloween-related [[Internet meme]]s through its popularity on [[4chan]]'s video games board.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/spooky-scary-skeletons |title=Spooky Scary Skeletons – Know Your Meme |website=Know Your Meme |access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=May 2020}} Within a few years, the song turned into a full-on viral phenomenon, with multiple electronic dance remixes and cover versions uploaded to YouTube with views in excess of 350 million and counting, and a dance challenge on the social-media network [[TikTok]] that has generated over 2.5&nbsp;million individual videos<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/10/how-spooky-scary-skeletons-became-tiktoks-halloween-song.html|title=How 'Spooky Scary Skeletons' Became the Internet's Halloween Anthem|first=Brian|last=Feldman|date=October 16, 2019|website=New York magazine}}</ref> and upwards of 243 million views.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/spooky-scary-skeletons-tiktok-meme-895887/|title=The Writer of the 'Golden Girls' Theme Is Blowing Up on TikTok For Being Spooky|first=E.J.|last=Dickson|date=October 8, 2019|website=Rolling Stone}}</ref> By 2019, the popularity of "Spooky Scary Skeletons" had inspired a deluxe digital release of ''Halloween Howls''. This version of the album included the addition of two extended electronic dance remixes of "Spooky Scary Skeletons." In 2021, due to the viral mania of "Spooky Scary Skeletons," Craft Recordings released a vinyl version of "Halloween Howls" with artwork done by acclaimed artist, Jess Rotter.

In 2020, an early version of Gold's song "Savannah" was issued as a digital single. It was followed by ''Something New: Unreleased Gold'' – a posthumous compilation album of previously unavailable tracks, including some demos – in vinyl, CD and digital formats, along with two digital singles from the album: the title song and "Come Down to Me."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://americansongwriter.com/premiere-come-down-to-mea-previously-unreleased-unheard-song-by-andrew-gold/?fbclid=IwAR1pgdCLNuynDjN5yQ_eJhhdAgsIy2O6MkyiH3LFkHQJpp_x-01R5QukV8Q/|title=Premiere: 'Come Down To Me,' A Previously Unreleased, Unheard Song by Andrew Gold|first=Paul|last=Zollo|date=March 27, 2020|website=American Songwriter}}</ref>

==Personal life and death==
Gold's first marriage was to Vanessa Gold, with whom he had three daughters, Emily, Victoria and Olivia.<ref name=NYT/>

In the early 1980s, Gold was engaged to singer [[Nicolette Larson]]; this ended shortly after the completion of Larson's 1982 album ''All Dressed Up and No Place to Go'', which Gold produced.

He later married Leslie Kogan who manages his musical legacy. [https://bmg.com/us/news/andrew-gold-publishing-catalogue.html]

Although Gold put personal references in the lyrics to "Lonely Boy" (including his year of birth), he said in an interview with author [[Spencer Leigh (radio presenter)|Spencer Leigh]] that the song was not autobiographical: "Maybe it was a mistake to do that, but I simply put in those details because it was convenient. I hadn't been a lonely boy at all -- I'd had a very happy childhood."<ref name="Leigh"/>

Gold was diagnosed with [[kidney cancer]] and responded well to treatment, but on June 3, 2011, he died in his sleep from what is suspected to have been heart failure at age 59 in Los Angeles.<ref name="NYT"/>
