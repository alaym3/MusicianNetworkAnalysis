'''Transit''' was an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from Stoneham, Massachusetts. From their formation in 2006 to their 2016 split, they released five albums, four EPs, and a split EP with [[Man Overboard (band)|Man Overboard]]. Although they largely took influence from emo acts such as [[Saves the Day]], [[Death Cab for Cutie]], [[American Football (band)|American Football]], [[Fairweather (band)|Fairweather]], [[Lifetime (band)|Lifetime]], and [[Hot Water Music]] their sound transformed from a fusion of [[pop punk]] and contemporary emo from their early releases into an [[indie rock]] sound by their final release, ''Joyride''.
