The single led him to join the official Norwegian Charts Tour,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://vglista.no/artist/chris-holsten/|title=Chris Holsten|newspaper=VG-lista 2016|access-date=2017-02-08|language=nb-NO|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202034232/http://vglista.no/artist/chris-holsten/|archivedate=2017-02-02}}</ref> even though the song never made it to the hit-list itself.

In 2017, he released the song "Mexico" which was a huge success with over 12 million streams on Spotify, followed by the songs "Echo" and "All About You" which he did with Madden. For the second year in a row, Chris performed at VG-Lista Rådhusplassen, in addition to Vulkan Arena, P3 Christine Live and Senkveld.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}

In 2020, Chris Holsten started the year with the single "Wish I Never Met You" and later "Empty Bottle" which are both to be found on the follow-up EP. The autumn of 2020 started with a solo tour that was to include seven concerts in Norway. The tour started with a concert in Eide, but the remaining concerts were abruptly put on hold due to the pandemic ( covid-19 ) that broke out in 2020. On April 17, 2020, he released his first EP Cold Hearts.

At the beginning of April 2020, Chris Holsten and Frida Ånnevik performed their Norwegian interpretation of the song "If The World Was Ending" by JP Saxe and Julia Michaels. Their version, "If the World", was initially only broadcast on live radio. They also made a recorded version with a video that was later shared on social media. In March 2020, when the Corona pandemic occurred in Norway, the song took on a whole new dimension. The song was officially released and quickly climbed into the VG-List Top 20 where it was for 19 weeks with 10th place as the best position.
