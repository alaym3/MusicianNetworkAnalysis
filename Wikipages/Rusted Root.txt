The band got its start as the [[house band]] playing a weekly gig in Jack's Back Room on Pittsburgh's [[South Side (Pittsburgh)|South Side]]. The band achieved fame in 1994 with its platinum-selling album ''[[When I Woke]]'', which included the hit single "[[Send Me on My Way]]".

==Musical style and influences==
The band is known for its fusion of acoustic, [[rock music|rock]], world and other styles of music, with a strong [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] section that draws from [[Music of Africa|African]], [[Latin American music|Latin American]], [[Music of India|Indian]] and [[Native American music|Native American]] influences. Michael Glabicki has acknowledged the popular success of [[Peter Gabriel]]'s 1986 album ''[[So (album)|So]]'' as an influence on his decision to incorporate [[worldbeat]] into his own music.<ref name="bonfiglio"/> The band's lyrical content varies but often talks about [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]]. The group's 2012 album, ''The Movement'', was fan-funded.<ref>Greenhaus, Mike https://relix.com/articles/detail/the-core-rusted-root/ Relix</ref>
