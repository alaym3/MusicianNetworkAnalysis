''Darling in the Franxx'' is set in a dystopian future where children are artificially created and indoctrinated solely to defend the remnants of civilization. The story follows a squad of ten pilots, particularly focusing on the partnership between Hiro, a former prodigy, and [[Zero Two]], a hybrid human and elite pilot who aspires to become entirely human. 

The animation began international distribution simultaneously upon its domestic release. The streaming service [[Crunchyroll]] internationally [[simulcast]] the series, with [[Aniplus Asia]] simulcasting the series in Southeast Asia. Service partner [[Funimation]] began the dubbed release of the series in February 2018.<ref>{{cite web|title=Funimation Announces Start of DARLING in the FRANXX SimulDub |url=https://twitter.com/FUNimation/status/959186496996569088 |website=[[Twitter]]|access-date=February 4, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.crunchyroll.com/forumtopic-1008795/winter-2018-simulcasts|title=Crunchyroll Announces Winter 2018 Simulcast License Acquisitions|date=January 8, 2018|website=[[Crunchyroll]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131005601/https://www.crunchyroll.com/forumtopic-1008795/winter-2018-simulcasts|archive-date=January 31, 2018|url-status=live|access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>

==Synopsis==
{{see also|List of Darling in the Franxx characters}}

===Setting===
''Darling in the Franxx'' takes place in a [[dystopia]]n post-apocalyptic future where the remnants of human civilization have abandoned the surface. Adults and children exist in contrasting environments from each other. Adults live in technologically advanced cities within Plantations and are immortal, but [[procreation]] and [[Romance (love)|relationships]] among them have become obsolete and undesirable. Artificially-created children, termed "parasites", are deprived of individuality and are educated only for piloting Franxx in pairs to defend humanity. The children are kept in isolation from adult society in environments nicknamed "birdcages", which emulate that of a bygone era so that they can develop the emotional responses required to pilot Franxx.

In the early 21st century, the progress of human civilization was accelerated by ground-breaking discoveries in mining technology, allowing the extraction of magma energy for a new low-cost, all-encompassing energy source. Scientists contributing to the breakthrough form "APE", an organization that would significantly influence world politics and the global economy as a result of their discoveries. After discovering human immortality, much of mankind opted to become immortal despite the side effect of losing their reproductive functions. A cult of personality surrounds Papa, the chairman of the APE, which all humans come to worship akin to a god. Now governing the remnants of civilization, APE leads humanity to abandon Earth's now desolate surface for the relative safety of mobile fortress-cities known as Plantations.

===Plot===
Pushed to the brink of extinction in a post-apocalyptic world, humanity is under constant threat from giant creatures known as {{Nihongo|klaxosaurs|叫竜|kyoryū}}, which are subdivided into at least four categories based on their size: "Conrad",{{efn|Miniature klaxosaurs (few meters large) are called "Conrad" level, originally from [[Conrad discontinuity]] named after [[Austria-Hungary|Austria-Hungarian]] [[seismology|seismologist]] [[Victor Conrad]].<ref name="Keyword">{{cite web |url=https://darli-fra.jp/keyword/ |title=Keyword |website=darli-fra.jp |language=ja |date=April 2, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226020657/https://darli-fra.jp/keyword/ |archive-date=April 2, 2018 }}</ref>}} "Mohorovičić",{{efn|Midsize klaxosaurs (dozens of meters large) are called "Mohorovičić" level, originally from [[Mohorovičić discontinuity]] named after [[Croats|Croatian]] [[seismologist]] [[Andrija Mohorovičić]].<ref name="Keyword"/>}} "Gutenberg"{{efn|Giant klaxosaurs (hundreds of meters large) are called "Gutenberg" level, originally from [[Core–mantle boundary]] named after [[Germany|German]] [[seismology|seismologist]] [[Beno Gutenberg]].<ref name="Keyword"/>}} and "(Super) Lehmann".{{efn|The largest klaxosaur class first seen in episode 15, spanning kilometers, originally from [[Lehmann discontinuity]] named after [[Danes|Danish]] [[seismology|seismologist]] [[Inge Lehmann]].<ref name="Keyword"/>}} Pushed to the brink of annihilation, parasites are raised to pilot giant [[mecha]] known as {{nihongo|Franxx{{efn|It has a nickname of "Steel maiden".<ref name="Keyword"/>}}|フランキス|Furankisu}} in boy-girl pairs. A male parasite is termed a "[[stamen]]", and a female parasite is referred to as a "[[pistil]]" (the male and female reproductive parts of a flower, respectively). Parasites are artificially created and have short lifespans. 

A team of ten parasites is assigned to the experimental Squad 13 of Plantation 13. One of them, Hiro (Code:016), is a former pilot-candidate prodigy who can no longer synchronize with his partner, and they both fail to complete the training program. While skipping his squad's graduation ceremony, Hiro encounters [[Zero Two]] (Code:002), an elite Franxx pilot with klaxosaur blood, red horns, and an infamous reputation as the "Partner Killer". It is rumored that Zero Two's partners are killed after pairing with her by the third time. Shortly after, a Klaxosaur attacks, disrupting Hiro's graduation ceremony and leaving Zero Two's partner killed in action. Despite the rumors, Hiro volunteers to become her new partner, or as Zero Two calls him, her "darling".

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Reception to ''Darling in the Franxx'' has been generally positive,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/mitsugi/anime-addicts-anonymous-podcast/e/55922993|title=Anime Addicts Anonymous - AAA 435: Darling! Go Deeper in My Franxx|date=23 August 2018|language=en}}</ref> with the series itself being praised most notably for its coming-of-age elements. Cactus Matt of ''Anime Q and A'' found the series enjoyable, as he commented, “I think that's a beautiful way to end this series, with the same message of hope for the future that was always an undercurrent (and later—the entire plot) of the series.”<ref>{{cite web|title=Darling in the Franxx Episode 24 Review|url=https://animeqanda.com/2018/07/10/darling-in-the-franxx-episode-24-finale-review/ |access-date=December 7, 2018}}</ref> Cal Win of ''Shinyuusite'' liked the series’ interpersonal drama and character development despite the lack of feedback in the second half of the series.<ref>{{cite web|title=Darling in the Franxx Episode 24 Review|date=July 8, 2018 |url=https://shinyuusite.wordpress.com/2018/07/08/darling-in-the-franxx-episode-24-review/comment-page-1/ |access-date=December 7, 2018}}</ref> Nate Zen of ''OtakuKart'' praises the animation quality and character development but commented the series lacked creativity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Darling in the Franxx Review|date=November 24, 2018|url=https://otakukart.com/review/darling-in-the-franxx-review/|access-date=December 12, 2018}}</ref> [[Crunchyroll]] gave the series a 4.3 out of 5 stars score for its elements of [[action film|action]], [[sci-fi]], [[comedy]], [[drama]], [[coming of age]], and [[romance film|romance]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Darling in the Franxx|url=https://www.crunchyroll.com/darling-in-the-franxx|access-date=December 12, 2018}}</ref>

Some of the series' themes were received with controversy regarding sexual innuendos of teenagers, the lack of plot development regarding the alien species VIRM, and the rushed pacing of the storyline following episode 15. While the series was received positively by viewers in Japan, the Western reception has been mixed. Eric Van Allen of ''[[Kotaku]]'' described the series as having "moments of brilliance that will stick with me as much as its hasty, rough conclusion" and was "truly fascinating to follow", despite the ending.<ref>{{cite web|title=Darling In The Franxx Doesn't Make Good On Its Promises |url=https://kotaku.com/darling-in-the-franxx-doesnt-make-good-on-its-promises-1827628015 |website=[[Kotaku]]|access-date=August 31, 2018}}</ref> Skyler Allen of ''A Piece of Anime'' appreciated the first half of the series as an "excellent, if flawed, coming of age mecha story with a lot of heart behind it" but described the concluding portion as a "thematically incoherent mess".<ref>{{cite web|title=Darling in the Franxx Review - A Piece of Anime |date=July 11, 2018 |url=https://apieceofanime.com/2018/07/11/darling-in-the-franxx-review/ |access-date=August 31, 2018}}</ref> Kyle Rogacion of ''Goomba Stomp'' called the series "an endearing character-driven coming-of-age story" but criticized it for having by the end "eschewed everything that made it great and settled for the easy way out”.<ref>{{cite web|title='Darling in the Franxx' Check-in: Ending With a Whimper &#124; Goomba Stomp |date=July 12, 2018
