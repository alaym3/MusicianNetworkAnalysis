'''7 Year Bitch''' was an American [[punk rock]] band from [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The band was active between 1990 and 1997 and released three albums over that time. The band formed at the same time as the emergence of the [[riot grrrl]] sub-genre, which is a sub-genre of punk music from the early to mid-1990s that emphasized the role of women in rock music. The Riot Grrrl movement began as a feminist response to the violence and misogyny that became more prominent in punk music in the mid to late 1980s, and 7 Year Bitch, an all female punk band, emerged as part of that sub-genre.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nguyen|first=Mimi Thi|date=July 2012|title=Riot Grrrl, Race, and Revival.|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0740770X.2012.721082|journal=Women & Performance: A Journal of Feminist Theory|publisher=Routledge|volume=22|issue=2–3|pages=173–196|doi=10.1080/0740770X.2012.721082|s2cid=144676874|via=Taylor and Francis & NEJM}}</ref>

== Biography ==

=== Career ===
7 Year Bitch was formed in 1990 by vocalist Selene Vigil, guitarist [[Stefanie Sargent]], bassist Elizabeth Davis and drummer Valerie Agnew.  Vigil, Sargent, and Agnew had been playing together in the Seattle band Barbie's Dream Car when their bassist left for Europe. They subsequently recruited Davis and renamed their band after the movie ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'', based on a suggestion by their friend, Ben London, of fellow Seattle band, [[Alcohol Funnycar]].

At their first concert, the band opened for [[The Gits]], who would prove to have a significant influence on their music. In 1991 the band released their first single "Lorna" and signed with [[C/Z Records]]. Their first album, ''[[Sick 'Em]]'', was released in 1992, but it was overshadowed by Sargent's death on June 27,<ref>Simmonds, Jeremy.

In July 1993, Gits' frontwoman and longtime friend of the band [[Mia Zapata]] was raped and murdered while walking home late at night.<ref>Muscio, Inga.

=== Break-up ===
In early 1997, the band began recording material for what was to be their fourth album. The band moved from Seattle to California, Elizabeth Davis and Valerie Agnew to San Francisco and Selene Vigil to Los Angeles.  With the recent departure of their guitarist, Roisin Dunne and the geographical separation between bandmates, Seven Year Bitch's career came to a close after a final tour with San Francisco's Lost Goat.

=== Aftermath ===
Following the break-up of 7 Year Bitch, bassist Elizabeth Davis joined the San Francisco-based band Clone, with whom she performed until 2003. In 2005, she helped to form the band [[Von Iva]].<ref>Hasty, Kate.[https://books.google.com/books?id=OBQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA76&dq=seven+year+bitch&hl=en&ei=qYI8TZLlIcPAgQea7-yjCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CEYQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&q=seven%20year%20bitch&f=false  ''Music Underground''].

She later released the solo album ''That Was Then'' in 2010. Roisin Dunne joined the band The Last Goodbye in 2006.
