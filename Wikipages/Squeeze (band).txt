'''Squeeze''' are <!-- Please do not change "are" to "is". This article uses British English. -->an English [[rock music|rock]] band that came to prominence in the United Kingdom during the [[New wave music|new wave]] period of the late 1970s, and continued recording in the 1980s, 1990s and 2010s. In the UK, their singles "[[Cool for Cats (song)|Cool for Cats]]", "[[Up the Junction (song)|Up the Junction]]" and "[[Labelled with Love]]" were top-ten chart hits. Though not as commercially successful in the United States, Squeeze had American hits with "[[Tempted (Squeeze song)|Tempted]]", [[Pulling Mussels (from the Shell)|"Pulling Mussels"]], and "Hourglass",<ref>{{cite web

The vast majority of their material is composed of lyrics by [[Chris Difford]] and music by [[Glenn Tilbrook]], who are guitarists and vocalists in the band.

==Career==
===First incarnation: 1974–1982===
The band's founding members in March 1974 were [[Chris Difford]] (guitar, vocals, lyrics), and [[Glenn Tilbrook]] (vocals, guitar, music). Difford claims that in 1973, he stole 50p from his mother's purse to put a card in a local sweetshop window to advertise for a guitarist to join his band, although he was not actually in a band at the time. Tilbrook was the only person who responded to the advert.<ref name="Loose Ends 8 November 2014">{{cite episode| title= Mick Fleetwood, Matt Berry, Imtiaz Dharker, Glenn Tilbrook and Chris Difford, GoGo Penguin| url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04nqpdb| series = Loose Ends| credits = Presenters: [[Clive Anderson]]| network = [[BBC]]| station = [[BBC Radio Four]]| airdate = 8 November 2014| minutes = 20:50}}</ref> Difford and Tilbrook began writing songs together, and soon added [[Jools Holland]] (keyboards) and [[Paul Gunn (drummer)|Paul Gunn]] (drums) to form an actual band. The group performed under several names, most frequently "Captain Trundlow's Sky Company" or "Skyco", before selecting the band name "Squeeze" as a facetious tribute to [[the Velvet Underground]]'s oft-derided 1973 album ''[[Squeeze (The Velvet Underground album)|Squeeze]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.squeezeofficial.com/biography/ |title=Biography |publisher=Squeeze Official |access-date=29 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021144823/http://www.squeezeofficial.com/biography/ |archive-date=21 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

[[Gilson Lavis]] replaced Gunn on drums, and [[Harry Kakoulli]] joined on bass in 1975.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Beckett |first1=Christopher & Jennifer |title=Squeeze Lineup History |url=http://www.squeezefan.com/lineups.htm |website=Squeezefan.com |access-date=11 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Harri Kakoulli – The Night Demons |url=http://www.packetofthree.com/2011/08/05/harri-kakoulli-the-night-demons/ |website=Packet of Three |access-date=11 July 2018 |date=5 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Here's the full, epic list of this year's Record Store Day releases |url=https://www.gigwise.com/news/105880/record-store-day-2016-full-vinyl-list-revealed-nirvana-bowie-who |website=Gigwise.com |access-date=11 July 2018}}</ref>

Squeeze's early career was spent around [[Deptford]] in south-east London, where they were part of a lively local music scene which included [[Alternative TV]] and [[Dire Straits]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bobbyvalentino.co.uk/electric-bluebirds-sleevenotes.html |title=Bobby Valentino -Electric Bluebirds Sleeve Notes |publisher=Bobbyvalentino.co.uk |access-date=9 January 2010 }}</ref> Though the group was initially signed to [[Miles Copeland III]]'s BTM Records, the label went under in late 1976,<ref>Sutcliffe, Phil & Fielder, Hugh (1981). ''L'Historia Bandido''. London and New York: Proteus Books. {{ISBN|0-906071-66-6}}. Page 16.</ref> and so their early singles and debut [[Extended play|EP]], 1977's ''[[Packet of Three]]'', were released on the [[Deptford Fun City]] label.<ref>{{cite web |title=Squeeze - Cat On A Wall |url=http://www.45cat.com/record/dfc01 |website=45cat.com|access-date=11 July 2018}}</ref>

Squeeze's first EP and most of their [[Squeeze (Squeeze album)|self-titled debut album]] (1978) were produced by [[John Cale]] for [[A&M Records]]. Cale had been a member of Velvet Underground from whose album Squeeze took their name. However, the debut album's two hit singles ("[[Take Me I'm Yours]]" and "Bang Bang") were produced by the band themselves, as the label found Cale's recordings uncommercial.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brackett |first1=Nathan |last2=Hoard |first2=Christian David |title=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide |url=https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/n787 774] |quote=squeeze john cale a&m. |publisher=Simon and Schuster |access-date=11 July 2018 |language=en |date=2004}}</ref>

In the United States and Canada, the band and album were dubbed ''UK Squeeze'' owing to legal conflicts arising from a contemporary American band called "Tight Squeeze". The "U.K." was dropped for all subsequent releases. In Australia, the same name change was used due to legal conflicts arising from an existing Sydney-based band also called "Squeeze". Albums in Australia were credited to ''UK Squeeze'' up to and including 1985's ''[[Cosi Fan Tutti Frutti]]''.<ref name="auto">{{cite book |last1=Difford |first1=Chris |last2=Tilbrook |first2=Glenn |last3=Drury |first3=Jim |title=Squeeze: Song by Song |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4UEGAAAACAAJ&q=%22UK+squeeze%22+legal+conflict |publisher=Sanctuary |access-date=11 July 2018 |language=en |date=2004|isbn=9781860746048 }}</ref>

The band's second album, ''[[Cool for Cats (album)|Cool for Cats]]'' (1979), contained the band's two highest charting UK singles in "Cool For Cats" and "Up The Junction", both of which peaked at No.&nbsp;2. [[John Bentley (musician)|John Bentley]] replaced Harry Kakoulli on bass in 1979 following the release of the LP.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

''[[Argybargy]]'' (1980), the band's third album, was also a UK hit. It was additionally a mild breakthrough in North America, as the single "[[Another Nail in My Heart]]" was a No.&nbsp;56 hit in Canada, and second single "[[Pulling Mussels (from the Shell)]]" received [[airplay]] on US rock radio stations. The video for the former was frequently shown on independent video music shows in the US.

Keyboardist [[Jools Holland]] left the band for a solo career in 1980. Keyboard duties were taken over by highly rated singer-keyboardist [[Paul Carrack]], a former member of both British soul-pop band [[Ace (band)|Ace]] and progressive rock band [[Roxy Music]].

In 1981, the band released ''[[East Side Story (Squeeze album)|East Side Story]]''. It was produced by [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Roger Bechirian]], and featured Carrack's lead vocals on the radio hit "[[Tempted (Squeeze song)|Tempted]]". Carrack himself left after the release of ''East Side Story'', and was replaced by [[Don Snow]]. This line-up recorded the ''[[Sweets from a Stranger]]'' LP in 1982. Negative reviews, the stresses of touring, drummer Gilson Lavis' drinking, and conflict between band members led Difford and Tilbrook to break up the band later that year, after releasing a final single, "[[Annie Get Your Gun (song)|Annie Get Your Gun]]".

===Difford and Tilbrook years: 1983–1984===
Difford and Tilbrook continued to work together, and released one self-titled album as the [[duet (music)|duo]] [[Difford & Tilbrook]] in 1984. Although it is not officially a Squeeze album, to many fans ''[[Difford & Tilbrook (album)|Difford & Tilbrook]]'' is considered a "lost" Squeeze LP because Difford and Tilbrook were themselves the only constant members of Squeeze.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/difford-tilbrook-mw0000193549|title=Difford & Tilbrook, Difford & Tilbrook|last=Damas|first=Jason|website=AllMusic|series=AllMusic Review|access-date=July 6, 2019}}</ref> Several Difford & Tilbrook tracks have been featured on officially sanctioned Squeeze [[compilation album|compilations]], and Tilbrook's official site lists ''Difford & Tilbrook'' as a Squeeze album.

The duo also contributed to a musical written and staged in Deptford during this period, entitled ''Labelled with Love'' and based in large part on the music of Squeeze.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

===Second incarnation: 1985–1999===
Squeeze re-formed to play a one night charity [[concert|gig]] in 1985, with all five members from the 1980 ''Argybargy'' period—Difford, Tilbrook, Holland, Lavis, and Bentley. The performance was such a success that the band unanimously agreed to resume [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] and touring as Squeeze. Searching for a different sound, the band replaced Bentley with bassist [[Keith Wilkinson (musician)|Keith Wilkinson]] from the ''Difford & Tilbrook'' sessions. This line-up released the 1985 LP ''[[Cosi Fan Tutti Frutti]]''.

The new LP featured complex double-tracked keyboard parts which could not be duplicated by a single keyboard player in a live setting; hence, Jools' brother Christopher Holland, then aged 17, played and toured as a second keyboardist in 1985. Christopher had also played [[Hammond organ]] on the album's fourth single "Heartbreaking World", which was sung by Jools Holland. However, Christopher Holland's tenure was short-lived, for he had signed to [[I.R.S. Records]] and was pursuing a solo career, so he was replaced by an official new member: [[Andy Metcalfe]] of [[The Soft Boys]] and [[Robyn Hitchcock|The Egyptians]]. A bassist in those groups, Metcalfe played keyboards with Squeeze. His tenure as the band's sixth member lasted until 1988.

In 1987, the sextet recorded the album ''[[Babylon and On]]''. A successful release on both sides of the Atlantic, this album contained the band's only US top 40 hits in "[[Hourglass (Squeeze song)|Hourglass]]" and "[[853-5937]]".

Metcalfe left the band in 1988, leaving the Difford / Tilbrook / Holland / Wilkinson / Lavis line-up to record 1989's ''[[Frank (Squeeze album)|Frank]]''. The LP was a commercial disappointment, from which no charting singles were taken in the UK, and the band was dropped from their long-time label A&M.

Adding a new second keyboard player in the person of [[Matt Irving]], the band issued the live album ''[[A Round and a Bout]]'' on I.R.S. Records in March 1990. Jools Holland left Squeeze again in early 1990, and was not immediately replaced. In his stead, the band used session musicians such as Irving (who was no longer an official band member), [[Steve Nieve]], and [[Bruce Hornsby]] for the 1991 release ''[[Play (Squeeze album)|Play]]'', which came out on the Reprise label. This release again spawned no UK hits, although in the US the singles "Satisfied" and "Crying in My Sleep" received significant airplay on modern rock stations, and in Canada "Satisfied" was a top 50 hit. However, Reprise dropped the band after this album. Following this, drummer Gilson Lavis was let go in 1992, and replaced by Nieve's [[The Attractions|Attractions]] bandmate [[Pete Thomas (drummer)|Pete Thomas]]. Paul Carrack also returned to the band in 1993, although by this point Squeeze was not so much a band as it was a trade name for Difford and Tilbrook plus [[session musician|sidemen]].

Squeeze re-signed to A&M in time for 1993's ''[[Some Fantastic Place]]''. After a period of commercial decline in the UK, lead single "Third Rail" hit No.&nbsp;39, becoming Squeeze's first UK [[Top 40]] hit in six years.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

Squeeze's line-up during the mid-1990s changed constantly. Though not an official Squeeze member, [[Aimee Mann]] was featured on vocals and guitar at many Squeeze shows during 1994. Thomas also exited the band that year, and Carrack doubled on snare and keyboards for a few gigs before session drummer [[Andy Newmark]] was brought in. Then—still in 1994—Carrack left, which allowed keyboardist Andy Metcalfe to return to the band for a short spell, playing on some live dates. Drummer [[Kevin Wilkinson]] (no relation to bassist Keith), formerly of [[The Waterboys]] and [[China Crisis]], was also added around this time, replacing Newmark. He lasted through the 1995 album ''[[Ridiculous (album)|Ridiculous]]'', which was recorded by the quartet of Difford, Tilbrook, Wilkinson and Wilkinson. The album spun off three minor hits in the UK: "This Summer", "Electric Trains" and "Heaven Knows". ("Heaven Knows" was used as the closing song in the 1995 film ''[[Hackers (film)|Hackers]]'' starring [[Angelina Jolie]].) In addition, a minimally remixed version of "This Summer" became a No.&nbsp;32 UK hit in 1996, a year after the original version peaked at No.&nbsp;36. Despite this, A&M once again dropped Squeeze from their roster in late 1996.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

Following the release of ''Ridiculous'', [[Don Snow]] (now known as Jonn Savannah) returned to Squeeze yet again as their touring keyboard player, but by 1997, the Squeeze line-up had officially dwindled down to just Difford and Tilbrook. That year the duo, billed as Squeeze, released the non-album single "Down in the Valley" as a fundraising single for [[Charlton Athletic F.C.]] Tilbrook formed the Quixotic label for this and future Squeeze-related releases, as well as releases by other artists.

For the 1998 album ''[[Domino (Squeeze album)|Domino]]'', the band was again a quintet consisting of Difford, Tilbrook, bassist [[Hilaire Penda]], ex-[[Del Amitri]] drummer [[Ashley Soan]], and yet another returning keyboardist in the person of Christopher Holland. [[Nick Harper]] often performed with this version of Squeeze as a guest touring musician, providing additional guitar and vocals. In January 1999, just days before a planned tour, Chris Difford suddenly announced that he was taking a "hiatus" from Squeeze. The last venue at which Squeeze played with Difford was at The Charlotte, [[Leicester]], England. The band subsequently continued as a quartet led by Tilbrook, with [[Jim Kimberley]] replacing Soan on some tour dates, and Christopher Holland exiting in the autumn to be replaced by Tilbrook's other frequent writing partner [[Chris Braide]].

On 27 November 1999, in [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]], Squeeze played their final gig before breaking up again. Difford and Tilbrook embarked on separate solo careers shortly thereafter.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

===Solo years: 2000–2006===
In 2003 Difford and Tilbrook collaborated on a song for the first time since ''Domino''. The track "Where I Can Be Your Friend" appeared on Tilbrook's well-reviewed second solo album, ''Transatlantic Ping Pong''. In 2004, the pair worked with [[music journalism|music journalist]] [[Jim Drury]] on the retrospective ''Squeeze: Song By Song''. In this book they declared they had become better friends since breaking up the band than they ever were while Squeeze was together.<ref name="auto"/>

However, a 2004 attempt by the [[VH1]] show ''[[Bands Reunited]]'' to reassemble the mid-1980s line-up of Squeeze (Difford, Tilbrook, Holland, Wilkinson and Lavis) ended in failure. While Difford and bassist Keith Wilkinson were both favourable to the idea and drummer Gilson Lavis expressed interest, Jools Holland felt he was too busy with current projects to participate.  Even more crucially, Glenn Tilbrook eventually decided against a band reunion at that point in time.

Still, Difford and Tilbrook's friendship continued, and Difford sat in for a few songs at a Tilbrook solo gig in Glasgow in December 2005.

[[File:Squeeze 2020-02-26.jpg|thumb|Squeeze, 2020]]

===Third incarnation: 2007–present===
In early 2007 it was announced that Difford and Tilbrook would re-form Squeeze for a series of shows throughout the latter half of the year, in support of Universal and Warner's re-issuing of the band's back catalogue and the release of a new 'best of' album, ''Essential Squeeze'', on 30 April. Jools Holland and Gilson Lavis were unable to take part in the series of shows, as they were touring under the "[[Jools Holland's Rhythm and Blues Orchestra|Jools Holland & His Rhythm & Blues Orchestra]]" name for most of the year. However, John Bentley re-joined on bass for the first time since Squeeze's last reunion show in 1985. The rest of the line-up was fleshed out by members of Tilbrook's touring band, the Fluffers: Stephen Large (keyboards) and Simon Hanson (drums).

On 7 July 2007, at the "Return to the Summer of Love Party" at [[Hawkhurst]], Kent, Difford and Tilbrook, each singing and playing acoustic guitars, played a seven-song set. They played, in order, "Take Me I'm Yours", "Pulling Mussels (From the Shell)", "Is that Love?", "Tempted", "Labelled with Love", "Cool for Cats" and "Up the Junction". The first actual full-band Squeeze show since 1999 took place less than a week later, at their old haunt The Albany (in Deptford) on Thursday 12 July; this was actually billed as a "warm up" gig prior to the upcoming US tour, and was followed by [[GuilFest]] 2007. They toured the US in August 2007, supported on various dates by [[Fountains of Wayne]], [[Will Hoge]], [[Big Head Todd and the Monsters]], [[Aimee Mann]], and [[Cheap Trick]].

In November 2007, the band released ''Five Live: On Tour in America'', a [[live album|live]] CD consisting of recordings from the American tour.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /> Television appearances and live shows in the US and UK followed in 2008, 2009 and 2010.

The band were honoured with a [[Heritage Award]] by [[PRS for Music]] in March 2010. A plaque was erected at [[Greenwich Dance]]'s The Borough Hall on Royal Hill in [[Greenwich]], London where they had performed their first gig.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenwich.co.uk/news/02993-squeeze-honoured-with-greenwich-plaque/ |title=Squeeze honoured with Greenwich plaque |publisher=Greenwich.co.uk |date=24 March 2010 |access-date=29 March 2012}}</ref>

Squeeze embarked on their 'Spot The Difference' tour of the US in July 2010, which continued in the UK in November and December. The CD ''Spot The Difference'', a re-recording of Squeeze's classic hits, was released in August 2010 to accompany the tour.

On the US tour, during a performance of "Pulling Mussels (From the Shell)" live on the ''Late Night with Jimmy Fallon'' show, Stephen Large played the keyboard solo on an [[Apple iPad]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/7894171/Squeeze-perform-using-iPad-as-keyboard.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Squeeze perform using iPad as keyboard | first=Tom | last=Rowley | date=16 July 2010}}</ref>

In September 2010, Stephen Large left the band and was replaced by Steve Nieve. Nieve had played as a session musician with Squeeze and Difford in the past, but had not—until this line-up change—ever been an official member of the group. However, within a matter of months, Large returned to the Squeeze line-up as Nieve left the band.

This line-up of Difford/Tilbrook/Bentley/Large/Hanson continued to tour throughout 2011 and 2012. A 20-track live recording, ''Live at the Fillmore'', was issued on iTunes and as a limited-edition white vinyl double LP in April 2012.

Prior to their 2012 UK tour, Squeeze announced on the ''[[Radcliffe & Maconie]]'' show on [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] that they would be selling live recordings of every night's show on the tour at each venue via a 'Pop up Shop'. When the tour commenced, each live recording the band sold also came with a 4-song bonus disc entitled ''Packet of Four''; these were studio recordings of new Squeeze songs, their first studio recordings of new material in 14 years.

On 11 February 2013, Tilbrook and Difford performed a live cover of [[the Beatles]]' song "[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]]" on [[BBC Radio 2]]. They were joined by [[Paul Jones (singer)|Paul Jones]] on harmonica. Alongside other contemporary artists, the performance was part of a 50th anniversary celebration of the original recording of the first Beatles [[Please Please Me|album of the same name]] in the same period of time. A documentary of the recordings was shown by [[BBC Four]] on 15 February 2013.

Beginning in the autumn of 2014, Difford and Tilbrook began touring as a duo, playing Squeeze hits in smaller venues in the UK. Squeeze, still operating as a full band, also continued to play occasional festival shows through 2014 and 2015.<ref>[http://www.squeezeofficial.com/tour-archive ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214115701/http://www.squeezeofficial.com/tour-archive |date=14 December 2013 }}</ref> In early 2015, Squeeze announced that bassist John Bentley would play his final gig with the band on 24 July. In an interview, Bentley announced his replacement will be Lucy Shaw (also the bassist for Tilbrook's backing band The Fluffers), which was officially confirmed by Squeeze in August.

In 2016–2018 the band continued to tour, in the US, Australia and extensively in the UK.

====''Cradle to the Grave''====
From 2008 forward, Difford and Tilbrook repeatedly stated in interviews that they planned to produce an album of new Squeeze material; they alluded to this in on-camera interviews at [[V Festival]] in both 2008 and 2011. In January 2010, it was announced that they would be spending part of the coming summer in Italy together writing songs for a new Squeeze album, and in an interview on [[BBC Radio Wales]] on 10 November 2013, Tilbrook stated that Squeeze would be recording between January and March 2014. However these sessions never took place and Tilbrook ended up recording and releasing the solo album ''Happy Endings''.

Around the same time, it was announced that Squeeze would be providing the music for a BBC drama called ''[[Cradle to Grave]]'', based on the autobiography ''[[Going To Sea in a Sieve]]'' by [[Danny Baker]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Happy Days!

Recording for the album finally got underway sometime in 2014/2015, and in April 2015, Difford announced on his Twitter feed that he had listened to a "first mix" of the new album. In July, Squeeze announced on their Facebook page that the album was entering the mastering stage. ''Cradle to the Grave'', the band's first album of original material since 1998 received its official release on 2 October 2015. A limited edition of 1000 copies were released through the band's own Love Records at the end of August.<ref name="rockshot" />

In August 2017, Squeeze revealed the title of their fifteenth studio album as ''The Knowledge''.

The band has continued touring through the UK, Ireland and North America.  A tour was announced on the official Squeeze website for 2020 in Australia and New Zealand, however it was indefinitely postponed due to scheduling problems as of November 2019.

On 25 June 2019 ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Squeeze among hundreds of artists whose material was destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite news|last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=28 June 2019 |date=25 June 2019}}</ref>

On 13 August 2019, the band officially announced the addition of a seventh member, guitarist Melvin Duffy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.squeezeofficial.com/welcome-back-melvin-duffy/|title=Welcome back, Melvin Duffy! « SQUEEZE|website=Squeezeofficial.com|access-date=9 November 2019}}</ref>  Duffy had played as a session musician on Squeeze's previous two albums, and at occasional live shows.

In September 2019, Squeeze were joined at the [[Louisville, Kentucky]] Bourbon & Beyond Festival by ex-[[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] drummer and [[Foo Fighters]] front-man [[Dave Grohl]] on drums, for a performance of the 1982 hit "[[Black Coffee in Bed]]".<ref name="rockcellar">{{cite news |title=Watch Dave Grohl Hop Behind the Drum Kit with Squeeze at Kentucky's Bourbon & Beyond Festival |url=https://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/dave-grohl-plays-with-squeeze-at-bourbon-and-beyond-festival/ |access-date=7 February 2020 |work=Rock Cellar Magazine |date=23 September 2013}}</ref>

In February 2020, it was announced that Yolanda Charles had departed the band, and new bassist Sean Hurley (who had filled in for Charles on bass on a few 2019 dates, including the date Dave Grohl guested) would be replacing her.  At the same time, [[Owen Biddle (musician)|Owen Biddle]] (normally a bassist) was announced as someone who would be "joining the Squeeze family" in an unspecified capacity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fsqueezeofficial%2Fposts%2F10157464002889094|title=Log into Facebook|website=Facebook.com|access-date=21 June 2021}}</ref> In April of that year, Glen Tilbrook while discussing an upcoming scheduled gig mentioned that it would be the "very first gig with our new bass player! A chap called Owen Biddle, who used to play in a band called The Roots."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.greatbritishlife.co.uk/people/interview-with-squeeze-s-glenn-tilbrook-7277650|title=Interview with Squeeze’s Glenn Tilbrook|date=21 April 2020|website=Greatbritishlife.co.uk|access-date=21 June 2021}}</ref>  However, the show in question was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
