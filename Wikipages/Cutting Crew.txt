'''Cutting Crew''' are <!-- Per WP:ENGVAR, bands that originate from Great Britain are treated plural. Please do not change "are" to "is". --> an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in London in 1985. They are best known for their debut album ''[[Broadcast (Cutting Crew album)|Broadcast]]'' and [[Hit record|hit]] singles, "[[(I Just) Died in Your Arms]]", "[[I've Been in Love Before (song)|I've Been in Love Before]]", "One for the Mockingbird", and "Everything But My Pride".

==History==
===1985–1986: Formation===
While still in his teens, [[Nick Van Eede]] (born Nicholas Eede) recorded a few UK solo singles in the late 1970s, and later was in the band '''The Drivers''',<ref name="crypticrock"/> which found success in Canada, particularly with their 1982 single "Tears On Your Anorak".  While touring Canada, The Drivers had a support band called Fast Forward, whose line up included guitarist [[Kevin MacMichael]].<ref name="crypticrock"/> Van Eede was so impressed with MacMichael's guitar playing that he asked him to form a new band with him. The Drivers split in 1983, but Van Eede and MacMichael joined forces in 1985 by relocating to London, England.<ref name="crypticrock"/> Initially, the two made [[demo (music)|demos]] that led to a [[recording contract]], before [[bassist]] Colin Farley and [[drummer]] [[Frosty Beedle|Martin "Frosty" Beedle]] joined in 1986.<ref name="Cutting Crew">{{cite journal|editor1-last=Larkin|editor1-first=Collin|title=Cutting Crew|journal=Encyclopedia of Popular Music|date=2 October 2014|volume=4th Edition|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/epm/49319}}</ref><ref name="crypticrock"/>

===1986–1988: ''Broadcast'' and breakthrough===
Their first album, ''[[Broadcast (Cutting Crew album)|Broadcast]]'', was released on [[Virgin Records]] in 1986. The song "(I Just) Died in Your Arms" was mixed in London at Utopia Studios by [[Tim Palmer]]. Although Virgin Records was already a major label in the [[UK]], their debut song, "[[(I Just) Died in Your Arms]]", provided the first US hit for Virgin as a full-fledged label. This song release quickly helped the band gain popularity. Virgin flew the band to [[New York City]] for initial recordings of the album, then to [[Australia]] to shoot [[music video]]s. The unknown band shot to No.&nbsp;1 in the major US market, as well as smaller markets such as [[Canada]] and [[Norway]], with their debut single. Their most popular [[single (music)|single]], it was a multiformat success in the US, where it also reached number four on the [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart, No.&nbsp;24 on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks]] chart and—in an extended remix version—No.&nbsp;37 on the [[Hot Dance Club Play|Hot Dance/Club Play]] chart.  The song peaked at No.&nbsp;4 in another major market, the [[UK Singles Chart]], as well as becoming a hit in the smaller [[Switzerland]] and [[South Africa]] markets. It went to No.&nbsp;2 in [[Sweden]] and [[Ireland]], and No.&nbsp;9 in [[Austria]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Steffen Hung |url=http://hitparade.ch/showitem.asp?interpret=Cutting+Crew&titel=%28I+Just%29+Died+In+Your+Arms&cat=s |title=Cutting Crew - (I Just) Died In Your Arms |publisher=hitparade.ch |access-date=21 May 2010}}</ref>

The choice for follow-up single in the UK had been "[[I've Been in Love Before (song)|I've Been In Love Before]]", but that song spent only three weeks in the UK Top 40, peaking at No.&nbsp;31.  Their choice for follow-up single in the US was their third UK release, "One for the Mockingbird", but the song was a relative commercial disappointment on both sides of the Atlantic, just cracking the Top 40 of the Hot 100 at No.&nbsp;38 and hitting No.&nbsp;29 on the Mainstream Rock chart in the US, No.&nbsp;47 in Canada and No.&nbsp;52 in the UK Singles Chart.

The band took a chance on "I've Been in Love Before" again, this time with greater success. The song became Cutting Crew's second US Top 10 on the Hot 100, peaking at No.&nbsp;9, and was their first major hit on the US Adult Contemporary chart, where it peaked at No.&nbsp;2. This success prompted a UK re-release, and this time it spent five weeks in the UK Singles Chart Top 40, peaking at No.&nbsp;24. The song failed to chart throughout most of Europe, but it peaked at No.&nbsp;8 in Canada. Despite an unflattering review by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, Cutting Crew received a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination as the Best New Artist of 1987.

===1988–1990: ''The Scattering''===
Disputes with management led to a long recording hiatus, which stalled the band's career momentum. Cutting Crew's second album, ''[[The Scattering (Cutting Crew album)|The Scattering]]'',<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Sutton |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-scattering-mw0000199452 |title=The Scattering - Cutting Crew &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=22 May 2014}}</ref> was finally released in early 1989. Its lead single, "(Between a) Rock and a Hard Place", (CA 54, UK 66, U.S. 77) failed to reach the Top 40. Van Eede's vocal style, however, did score a sizeable US Adult Contemporary hit with "Everything But My Pride."  That song peaked at No.&nbsp;4 and stayed in the top 50 for 22 weeks.  It climbed to No.&nbsp;72 on the Canadian pop charts, though it failed to hit the US Hot 100. The prophetically named "The Last Thing" scaled the AC charts as high as No.&nbsp;17 in early 1990 and went to No.&nbsp;90 on the Canadian chart, and has been their final chart hit to date. Although a video for the title track did air briefly in the UK and North America, ''The Scattering'' failed to chart.

===1991–1992: ''Compus Mentus''===
Recorded at The Mill Studios in Cookham, Berkshire on the Thames and produced by Chris Neil. Farley and Beedle left the group in 1991 with no replacement, leaving only Eede and MacMichael in the group.<ref name="crypticrock"/> Eede sang and played keys and MacMichael played all guitars (lead and bass). Standout tracks are "Frigid as England" written by Jeff Lowe, the plaintive "Sweet Auburn" and the darkly comic, "Don't Let It Bring You Down."

The album spawned one single, "If That's The Way You Want It."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/en_US/Cutting-Crew-If-Thats-The-Way-You-Want-It/release/2386865|title=Cutting Crew - If That's The Way You Want It (CD, 1992) - Discogs|work=[[Discogs]]|access-date=22 July 2020}}</ref> Neither the single nor the album itself charted. Within weeks of its release, Virgin Records was bought by EMI and the album became obsolete.

===1993–2005: Break-up and MacMichael's death===
The band broke up in 1993; shortly after the release of their ''Compus Mentus'' album. After the break-up, MacMichael joined forces with [[Robert Plant]] and played on his ''[[Fate of Nations]]'' album. On 31 December 2002, MacMichael died of [[lung cancer]]<ref name="grinning"/><ref name="crypticrock"/> at the [[Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre]] in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], at the age of 51.

===2005–2014: Reformation===
In 2003, Van Eede formed the group Grinning Souls. This group independently released the album ''Capture'' in 2005. The following year, Van Eede took the decision to re-release the album under the title ''Grinning Souls'',<ref name="grinning">{{cite web|url=https://www.musicomh.com/reviews/albums/cutting-crew-grinning-souls|title=Cutting Crew - Grinning Souls|author=Bansal, Vik|work=[[musicOMH]]|date=6 March 2006|access-date=22 July 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://music.apple.com/us/album/grinning-souls/266344233|title=Grinning Souls by Cutting Crew on Apple Music|work=[[Apple Music]]|access-date=22 July 2020}}</ref> this time crediting the work to Cutting Crew.<ref name="grinning"/><ref name="crypticrock"/> Grinning Souls (the band) became Cutting Crew for all subsequent live work: Van Eede was the only original Cutting Crew member in the group.

The new band toured in Germany, Norway, the UK, Canada, Hungary, Switzerland and the USA with, amongst others, [[ABC (band)|ABC]], [[Berlin (band)|Berlin]], [[Wang Chung (band)|Wang Chung]], [[Supertramp]], [[Level 42]] and [[Midge Ure]]. In 2008, Cutting Crew signed a US deal with label Spectra Records.
