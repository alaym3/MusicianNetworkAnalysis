'''Pet Symmetry''' is an American [[emo]] band from [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. The band formed in 2012, and they are currently signed to Storm Chaser Records. The band's name is a play on words taken from [[Stephen King]]'s novel ''[[Pet Sematary]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1937599/qa-pet-symmetry-on-dad-puns-cutting-loose-starting-a-band-because-of-harvey-danger/franchises/interview/|title=Q&A: Pet Symmetry On Dad Puns, Cutting Loose, & Starting A Band Because Of Harvey Danger|date=2017-04-27|website=Stereogum|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref>
