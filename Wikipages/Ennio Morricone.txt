==Early life and education==
Morricone was born in Rome, the son of Libera Ridolfi and Mario Morricone, a musician. At the time of his birth [[Fascist Italy (1922–1943)|Italy]] was under [[Fascism|fascist]] rule.<ref name="Leinberger">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G2lqIuCFJ_MC&pg=PA1 |title=Ennio Morricone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly: A Film Score Guide |author=Charles Leinberger |year=2004 |publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]] |pages=1–3 |isbn=9781461658412 |access-date=6 November 2016}}</ref> His family came from [[Arpino]], near [[Frosinone]]. Morricone had four siblings — Adriana, Aldo,{{refn|group=nb|Aldo died age three after his nanny mistakenly fed him cherries, to which he was severely [[Food allergy|allergic]].<ref name="filmreference.com" />}} Maria, and Franca — and lived in [[Trastevere]] in the centre of Rome. His father was a professional trumpeter who performed in light-music orchestras while his mother set up a small textile business.<ref name="filmreference.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/23/Ennio-Morricone.html |title=Ennio Morricone Biography (1928–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |access-date=13 September 2011}}</ref> During his early schooldays, Morricone was also a classmate of his later collaborator [[Sergio Leone]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ennio Morricone and Sergio Leone pose together in the primary school year book|date=2 March 2016|url=https://weirditaly.com/2016/03/02/ennio-morricone-sergio-leone-pose-together-primary-school-year-book/|access-date=April 14, 2021|url-status=live}}</ref>

Morricone's father first taught him to read music and to play several instruments. He entered the [[Conservatorio Santa Cecilia|Saint Cecilia Conservatory]] to take trumpet lessons under the guidance of Umberto Semproni.<ref name="Leinberger" /> He formally entered the conservatory in 1940 at age 12, enrolling in a four-year harmony program that he completed within six months. He studied the trumpet, composition, and [[choral music]] under the direction of [[Goffredo Petrassi]], to whom Morricone would later dedicate concert pieces. 
[[File:Goffredo.petrassi2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Goffredo Petrassi]], Morricone's teacher]]
In 1941 Morricone was chosen among the students of the Saint Cecilia Conservatory to be a part of the Orchestra of the Opera, directed by [[Carlo Zecchi]] on the occasion of a tour of the [[Veneto]] region.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.geocities.ws/neja_nis/morriconebio.htm |title=Sajt dejana Nejica – Ennio Morricone |website=www.geocities.ws}}</ref> He received his diploma in trumpet in 1946,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.polarmusicprize.org/laureates/ennio-morricone/press-material/ |title=Ennio Morricone |website=Polar Music Prize |language=en-US|access-date=17 August 2017}}</ref> continuing to work in classical composition and arrangement.<ref name="Leinberger" /> Morricone received the ''Diploma in Instrumentation for Band Arrangement'' with a mark of 9/10 in 1952. His studies concluded at the Conservatory of Santa Cecilia in 1954 when he obtained a final 9.5/10 in his ''Diploma in Composition'' under Petrassi.<ref name="fancast">{{cite web |title=About Ennio Morricone |url=http://www.fancast.com/people/Ennio-Morricone/313734/biography |publisher=fancast.com|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211103035/http://www.fancast.com/people/Ennio-Morricone/313734/biography |archive-date=11 February 2009}}</ref>

==Career==
===First compositions===
Morricone wrote his first compositions when he was six years old and he was encouraged to develop his natural talents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esz.it/aut/eng/ennio_morricone/profilo.htm |title=Ennio Morricone, Critical profile by Sergio Miceli |publisher=Esz.it |access-date=13 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722033148/http://www.esz.it/aut/eng/ennio_morricone/profilo.htm |archive-date=22 July 2011}}</ref> In 1946, he composed "Il Mattino" ("The Morning") for voice and piano on a text by Fukuko, first in a group of seven "youth" Lieder.<ref name="pytheas">{{cite web |url=http://www.pytheasmusic.org/morricone.html |title=Ennio Morricone |publisher=pytheasmusic.org |access-date=6 July 2020}}</ref>

In the following years, he continued to write music for the theatre as well as classical music for voice and piano, such as "Imitazione", based on a text by Italian poet [[Giacomo Leopardi]], "Intimità", based on a text by Olinto Dini, "Distacco I" and "Distacco II" with words by R. Gnoli, "Oboe Sommerso" for baritone and five instruments with words by poet [[Salvatore Quasimodo]], and "Verrà la Morte", for alto and piano, based on a text by novelist [[Cesare Pavese]].<ref name="pytheas" />

In 1953, Morricone was asked by [[Gorni Kramer]] and [[Lelio Luttazzi]] to write an arrangement for some medleys in an American style for a series of evening radio shows. The composer continued with the composition of other 'serious' classical pieces, thus demonstrating the flexibility and eclecticism that always has been an integral part of his character. Many orchestral and chamber compositions date, in fact, from the period between 1954 and 1959: ''Musica per archi e pianoforte'' (1954), ''Invenzione, Canone e Ricercare per piano''; ''Sestetto per flauto, oboe, fagotto, violino, viola, e violoncello'' (1955), ''Dodici Variazione per oboe, violoncello, e piano''; ''Trio per clarinetto, corno, e violoncello''; ''Variazione su un tema di Frescobaldi'' (1956); ''Quattro pezzi per chitarra'' (1957); ''Distanze per violino, violoncello, e piano''; ''Musica per undici violini, Tre Studi per flauto, clarinetto, e fagotto'' (1958); and the ''Concerto per orchestra'' (1957), dedicated to his teacher [[Goffredo Petrassi]].<ref name="pytheas" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dantealighieri.net/cambridge/Ital_music.html#Ennio%20Morricone |title=Dante Alighieri, Ennio Morricone biography |publisher=Dantealighieri.net |date=3 December 1911 |access-date=13 September 2011}}</ref>

Morricone soon gained popularity by writing his first background music for radio dramas and quickly moved into film.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.classicfm.co.uk/music/composers/h-m/ennio-morricone/ |title=Ennio Morricone |publisher=classicfm.co.uk |access-date=28 January 2012}}</ref>

====Composing for radio, television, and pop artists====

Morricone's career as an arranger began in 1950, by arranging the piece ''Mamma Bianca'' (Narciso Parigi).<ref>[http://www.chimai.com/index.cfm?module=MUS&mode=ALB&id=5418 Chimai.com, Mamma Bianco], Retrieved on 17 July 2016</ref> On occasion of the "[[Jubilaeum Maximum|Anno Santo]]" ([[Jubilee (Christianity)|Holy Year]]), he arranged a long group of popular songs of devotion for radio broadcasting.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://text.wz.cz/em/articles/miceli_bio_en.htm |title=Ennio Morricone biography, retrieved July 17, 2016 |access-date=17 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817071614/http://text.wz.cz/em/articles/miceli_bio_en.htm |archive-date=17 August 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1956, Morricone started to support his family by playing in a [[jazz]] band and [[arrangement|arranging]] pop songs for the Italian broadcasting service [[RAI]]. He was hired by [[Radiotelevisione Italiana|RAI]] in 1958 but quit his job on his first day at work when he was told that broadcasting of music composed by employees was forbidden by a company rule. Subsequently, Morricone became a top studio arranger at RCA Victor, working with [[Renato Rascel]], [[Rita Pavone]], Domenico Modugno, and [[Mario Lanza]].

Throughout his career, Morricone composed songs for several national and international jazz and pop artists, including [[Gianni Morandi]] (''Go Kart Twist'', 1962), [[Alberto Lionello]] (''La donna che vale'', 1959), [[Edoardo Vianello]] (''Ornella'', 1960; ''Cicciona cha-cha'', 1960; ''Faccio finta di dormire'', 1961; ''T'ho conosciuta'', 1963; and also ''Pinne, fucine ed occhiali'', ''I Watussi'' and ''Guarda come dondolo''<ref>The master Morricone linked female singers to [[trombone]]s and the male ones to [[bigle|bugles]].

In 1963, the composer co-wrote (with Roby Ferrante) the music for the composition "Ogni volta" ("Every Time"), a song that was performed by [[Paul Anka]] for the first time during the [[Festival della canzone italiana|Festival di Sanremo]] in 1964. This song was arranged and conducted by Morricone and sold more than three million copies worldwide, including one million copies in Italy alone.<ref>[http://www.vervemusicgroup.com/paulanka/bio/ Paul Anka biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929082302/http://www.vervemusicgroup.com/paulanka/bio/ |date=29 September 2009 }}, Verve Music Group, retrieved 6 February 2013.</ref>

Another success was his composition "Se telefonando". Performed by [[Mina (Italian singer)|Mina]], it was a track on ''[[Studio Uno 66]]'', the 4th studio album by Mina. Morricone's sophisticated arrangement of "Se telefonando" was a combination of melodic trumpet lines, [[Hal Blaine]]–style drumming, a string set, a 1960s [[Europop]] female [[choir]], and intensive subsonic-sounding trombones. The Italian Hitparade No. 7 song had eight transitions of [[tonality]] building tension throughout the chorus. During the following decades, the song was recorded by several performers in Italy and abroad including covers by [[Françoise Hardy]] and [[Iva Zanicchi]] (1966), [[Delta-V (musical group)|Delta V]] (2005), [[Vanessa and the O's]] (2007), and [[Neil Hannon]] (2008).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mon-amie-hardy-rose.nice-topic.com/Reprises-de-Se-telefonando-h63.htm |title=Se telefonando |publisher=Mon-amie-hardy-rose.nice-topic.com |access-date=24 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714180742/http://mon-amie-hardy-rose.nice-topic.com/Reprises-de-Se-telefonando-h63.htm |archive-date=14 July 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> ''Françoise Hardy – Mon amie la rose'' site in the reader's poll conducted by the newspaper'' [[la Repubblica]]'' to celebrate Mina's 70th anniversary in 2010, 30,000 voters picked the track as the best song ever recorded by Mina.<ref>[http://www.repubblica.it/spettacoli-e-cultura/2010/03/25/news/mina-pani-2888803/ Mamma Mina cestinò i complimenti dei Beatles] ''[[La Repubblica]]'', Gino Castaldo, 25 March 2010</ref>

In 1987, Morricone co-wrote ''[[It Couldn't Happen Here (song)|It Couldn't Happen Here]]'' with the [[Pet Shop Boys]].

====First film scores====

After graduation in 1954, Morricone started to write and arrange music as a [[ghost writing|ghost writer]] for films credited to already well-known composers, while also arranging for many light music orchestras of the RAI television network, working especially with [[Armando Trovajoli]], [[Alessandro Cicognini]], and [[Carlo Savina]]. He occasionally adopted Anglicized [[pseudonym]]s, such as '''Dan Savio''' and '''Leo Nichols'''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.elcorreo.com/butaca/cine/morricone-cuelga-batuta-20190108124758-ntrc.html |title=Morricone cuelga la batuta |first=Oskar |last=Belategui |date=8 January 2019 |access-date=13 June 2019 |newspaper=[[El Correo]] |language=es |publisher=[[Vocento]]}}</ref>

In 1959, Morricone was the conductor (and uncredited co-composer) for [[Mario Nascimbene]]'s score to ''Morte di un amico'' (''[[Death of a Friend]]''), an Italian drama directed by [[Franco Rossi (director)|Franco Rossi]]. In the same year, he composed music for the theatre show ''Il lieto fine'' by [[Luciano Salce]].

1961 marked his real film debut with Luciano Salce's ''[[The Fascist|Il Federale (The Fascist)]]''. In an interview with American composer [[Fred Karlin]], Morricone discussed his beginnings, stating, "My first films were light comedies or costume movies that required simple musical scores that were easily created, a genre that I never completely abandoned even when I went on to much more important films with major directors".<ref name="Biography of Ennio Morricone">{{cite web |url=http://ennio-morricone.com/#/biography.html |title=Biography of Ennio Morricone |publisher=ennio-morricone.com |access-date=22 January 2013}}</ref>

With ''Il Federale'' Morricone began a long-run collaboration with Luciano Salce. In 1962, Morricone composed the jazz-influenced score for Salce's comedy ''[[Crazy Desire|La voglia matta (Crazy Desire)]]''. That year Morricone also arranged Italian singer [[Edoardo Vianello]]'s summer hit "Pinne, fucile, e occhiali", a cha-cha song, peppered with added water effects, unusual instrumental sounds and unexpected stops and starts.<ref>{{cite book |author=Enrico Deregibus |title=Dizionario completo della Canzone Italiana |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QBko1XW9KOUC&pg=PA464 |access-date=22 January 2013 |date=8 October 2010 |publisher=Enrico Deregibus |isbn=978-88-09-75625-0}}</ref>

Morricone wrote works for the concert hall in a more avant-garde style.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Petridis |first1=Alexis |title=Ennio Morricone: 10 of his greatest compositions |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/06/ennio-morricone-10-of-his-greatest-compositions |access-date=6 July 2020 |agency=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian Media Group}}</ref> Some of these have been recorded, such as ''Ut'', a trumpet concerto dedicated to [[Mauro Maur]].<ref>{{cite book |title=La Tromba |oclc=36806200 }}</ref>

===The Group and New Consonance===

From 1964 up to their eventual disbandment in 1980, Morricone was part of ''[[Gruppo di Improvvisazione Nuova Consonanza]]'' (G.I.N.C.), a group of composers who performed and recorded [[avant-garde]] free improvisations. The Rome-based avant-garde ensemble was dedicated to the development of [[improvisation]] and new music methods. The ensemble functioned as a laboratory of sorts, working with anti-musical systems and sound techniques in an attempt to redefine the new music ensemble and explore "New Consonance".<ref>[https://www.allmusic.com/artist/gruppo-di-improvvisazione-nuova-consonanza-mn0001409455 Gruppo di Improvvisazione Nuova Consonanza], biography, Allmusic, Sylvie Harrison. Retrieved 24 January 2013.</ref>

Known as "The Group" or "Il Gruppo", they released seven albums across the [[Deutsche Grammophon]], RCA, and Cramps labels: ''Gruppo di Improvvisazione Nuova Consonanza'' (1966), ''The Private Sea of Dreams'' (1967), ''Improvisationen'' (1968), ''The Feedback'' (1970), ''Improvvisazioni a Formazioni Variate'' (1973), ''Nuova Consonanza'' (1975), and ''Musica su Schemi'' (1976). Perhaps the most famous of these is their album entitled ''The Feed-back'', which combines [[free jazz]] and avant-garde classical music with [[funk]]; the album frequently is sampled by [[hip hop]] DJs and is considered to be one of the most collectable records in existence, often fetching more than $1,000 at auction.<ref>Alvin Lucia, liner notes, ''Niente''. (The Omni Recording Corporation/The Roundtable), 2012.</ref>

[[File:Gruppoimprovvisazione.jpg|thumb|Morricone in 1978 with [[Gruppo di Improvvisazione Nuova Consonanza]]]]
Morricone played a key role in The Group and was among the core members in its revolving line-up; in addition to serving as their trumpet player, he directed them on many occasions and they can be heard on a large number of his scores.<ref name="Sciannameo">{{cite book |last = Sciannameo |first=Franco |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b2_KDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA77 |title=Toward a New Consonance |work=Reflections on the Music of Ennio Morricone: Fame and Legacy |date=2020 |isbn=978-1-49-856901-9 |pages=77–79 }}</ref> Held in high regard in avant-garde music circles, they are considered to be the first experimental composers collective, their only peers being the British improvisation collective [[AMM (group)|AMM]].

The ensemble's groundbreaking work informed their work in composition. The ensemble also performed in varying capacities with Morricone, contributing to some of his 1960s and 1970s Italian soundtracks, including ''[[A Quiet Place in the Country]]'' (1969) and ''[[Cold Eyes of Fear]]'' (1971).<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wz2dxDNaEDgC&pg=PA267 |title=''Film And Television Scores, 1950–1979: A Critical Survey by Genre'', Kristopher Spencer, McFarland, September 9, 2008 |date=10 January 2014 |isbn=9780786452286 |access-date=24 August 2014 |last1=Spencer |first1=Kristopher}}</ref>

===Film music genres===

==== Comedy ====

Morricone's earliest scores were Italian light comedy and costume pictures, where he learned to write simple, memorable themes. During the 1960s and 1970s he composed the scores for comedies such as ''[[Eighteen in the Sun]]'' (''Diciottenni al sole'', 1962), ''[[Il Successo]]'' (1963), [[Lina Wertmüller]]'s ''[[I basilischi]]'' (''The Basilisks''/''The Lizards'', 1963),<ref name="Biography of Ennio Morricone"/> ''[[Slalom (film)|Slalom]]'' (1965), ''[[Menage all'italiana]]'' (''Menage Italian Style'', 1965), ''[[How I Learned to Love Women]]'' (''Come imparai ad amare le donne'', 1966), ''[[Her Harem]]'' (''L'harem'', 1967), ''[[A Fine Pair]]'' (''Ruba al prossimo tuo'', 1968), ''[[Alibi (1969 film)|L'Alibi]]'' (1969), ''[[This Kind of Love (film)|This Kind of Love]]'' (''Questa specie d'amore'', 1972), ''[[Winged Devils]]'' (''Forza "G"'', 1972), and ''[[Fiorina la vacca]]'' (1972).

His best-known scores for comedies includes ''[[La Cage aux Folles (film)|La Cage aux Folles]]'' (1978) and ''[[La Cage aux Folles II]]'' (1980), both directed by [[Édouard Molinaro]], ''[[Il ladrone]]'' (''The Good Thief'', 1980), [[Georges Lautner]]'s ''[[La Cage aux Folles 3: The Wedding]]'' (1985), [[Pedro Almodóvar]]'s ''[[Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!]]'' (1990) and Warren Beatty's ''Bulworth'' (1998). Morricone never ceased to arrange and write music for comedies. In 2007, he composed a lighthearted score for the Italian romantic comedy ''Tutte le Donne della mia Vita'' by Simona Izzo, the director who co-wrote the Morricone-scored religious mini-series ''Il Papa Buono''.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Nick Vivarelli International Correspondent @NickVivarelli |url=https://variety.com/2007/film/news/morricone-i-can-do-anything-1117959621/ |title=Morricone: 'I can do anything' |magazine=Variety.com |date=15 February 2007 |access-date=24 August 2014}}</ref>

==== Westerns ====
Although his first films were undistinguished,{{Clarify|date=July 2020}} Morricone's arrangement of an American folk song intrigued director and former schoolmate [[Sergio Leone]]. Before being associated with Leone, Morricone already had composed some music for less-known western movies such as ''[[Duello nel Texas]]'' (aka ''Gunfight at Red Sands'') (1963). In 1962, Morricone met American folksinger [[Peter Tevis]], with the two collaborating on a version of [[Woody Guthrie]]'s ''[[Pastures of Plenty]]''. Tevis is credited with singing the lyrics of Morricone's songs such as "A Gringo Like Me" (from ''Gunfight at Red Sands'') and "Lonesome Billy" (from ''Bullets Don't Argue'').<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=z9Tjh55dlDUC&pg=PA147#v=onepage&q=morricone%20first%20western%20films Christopher Frayling, ''Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone''], I. B. Tauris, 2 April 2006.</ref> Tevis later recorded a vocal version of ''A Fistful of Dollars'' that was not used in the film.

===== Association with Sergio Leone =====

The turning point in Morricone's career took place in 1964, the year in which his third child, [[Andrea Morricone]], who would also become a film composer, was born. Film director Sergio Leone hired Morricone, and together they created a distinctive score to accompany Leone's [[Spaghetti Western|different version]] of the [[Western (genre)|Western]], ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' (1964).<ref>{{cite news |title=Morricone, la musica per il compagno di scuola Sergio Leone |url=https://www.adnkronos.com/intrattenimento/spettacolo/2020/07/06/morricone-musica-per-compagno-scuola-sergio-leone_66Md0LxcNpUYJufDdnzD7M.html |access-date=7 July 2020 |work=Adnkronos |date=6 July 2020 |language=it}}</ref>

'''The [[Dollars Trilogy]]'''
{{main|The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (soundtrack)}}

Because budget strictures limited Morricone's access to a full orchestra, he used gunshots, cracking whips, whistle, voices, [[jew's harp]], trumpets, and the new Fender electric guitar, instead of orchestral arrangements of Western standards à la [[John Ford]]. Morricone used his special effects to punctuate and comically tweak the action—cluing in the audience to the [[silence|taciturn]] man's ironic stance.<ref name="Leinberger" />{{rp|69–77}} <!--Though sonically bizarre for a movie score, Morricone's music was [[wikt:viscerally|viscerally]] true to Leone's vision.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}-->

As memorable as Leone's [[close-up]]s, harsh violence, and black comedy, Morricone's work helped to expand the musical possibilities of film scoring. Initially, Morricone was billed on the film as Dan Savio. ''A Fistful of Dollars'' came out in Italy in 1964 and was released in America three years later, greatly popularising the so-called [[Spaghetti Western]] genre. For the American release, Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone decided to adopt American-sounding names, so they called themselves respectively, Bob Robertson and Dan Savio. Over the film's theatrical release, it grossed more than any other Italian film up to that point.<ref name="Hughes7">{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Howard|title=Aim for the Heart: The Films of Clint Eastwood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PbWKDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA7|date=30 July 2009|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-0-85771-021-5|page=7}}</ref> The film debuted in the United States in January 1967, where it grossed {{USD|4.5&nbsp;million|link=yes}} for the year.<ref name="Hughes7"/> It eventually grossed $14.5&nbsp;million in its American release,<ref name="Hughes7"/> against its budget of {{USD}}200,000.<ref name="Giddins2010">{{cite book|last=Giddins|first=Gary|title=Warning Shadows: Home Alone with Classic Cinema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DuYHM-Ltkx4C&pg=PA122|date=19 April 2010|publisher=W.

With the score of ''A Fistful of Dollars'', Morricone began his 20-year collaboration with his childhood friend [[Alessandro Alessandroni]] and his Cantori Moderni.<ref name="StrachanMask2014">{{cite book |last1=Strachan |first1=Ian Gregory |last2=Mask |first2=Mia |title=Poitier Revisited: Reconsidering a Black Icon in the Obama Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kEogBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT268|date=27 November 2014|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-62356-923-5|page=268}}</ref> Alessandroni provided the whistling and the twanging guitar on the film scores, while his Cantori Moderni were a flexible troupe of modern singers. Morricone specifically exploited the solo [[soprano]] of the group, [[Edda Dell'Orso]], at the height of her powers "an extraordinary voice at my disposal".<ref>[https://www.italyonthisday.com/2018/02/edda-dellorso-Italian-vocalist-Morricone-Spaghetti-westerns-sergio-leone.html Edda Dell'Orso – vocalist / Soprano was wordless voice of Morricone soundtracks] italyonthisday.com 16 February 2018</ref>

The composer subsequently scored Leone's other two ''[[Dollars Trilogy]]'' (or ''[[Man with No Name|Man with No Name Trilogy]]'') spaghetti westerns: ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'' (1965) and ''The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly'' (1966). All three films starred the American actor [[Clint Eastwood]] as ''The Man With No Name'' and depicted Leone's own intense vision of the mythical West. Morricone commented in 2007: "Some of the music was written before the film, which was unusual. Leone's films were made like that because he wanted the music to be an important part of it; he kept the scenes longer because he did not want the music to end." According to Morricone this explains "why the films are so slow".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/mar/18/features.musicmonthly10 Q&A – Ennio Morricone] ''[[The Guardian]]'' 18 March 2007</ref>

Despite the small film budgets, the ''Dollars Trilogy'' was a box-office success. The available budget for ''The Good, the Bad, and The Ugly'' was about {{USD}}1.2&nbsp;million, but it became the most successful film of the ''Dollars Trilogy'', grossing {{USD}}25.1&nbsp;million in the United States and more than 2,3&nbsp;billion [[Italian lira|lire]] (1,2&nbsp;million EUR) in Italy alone. Morricone's score became a major success and sold more than three million copies worldwide. On 14 August 1968 the original score was certified by the [[RIAA]] with a golden record for the sale of 500,000 copies in the United States alone.<ref>[https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database RIAA, Gold and Platinum – The Good, the Bad & the Ugly], Retrieved 24 January 2013 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331234333/http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database |date=31 March 2013 }}</ref>

The main theme to ''The Good, the Bad, and The Ugly'', also titled "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly", was a hit in 1968 for [[Hugo Montenegro]], whose rendition was a No.2 Billboard pop single in the U.S. and a U.K. No.1 single (for four weeks from mid-November that year).<ref>{{cite web|title=Official [U.K.] Singles Chart Top 50: 13–19 November 1968|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/19681113/7501/ |publisher=The Official UK Charts Company |access-date=21 August 2020}}</ref>

"[[The Ecstasy of Gold]]" became one of Morricone's best-known compositions. The opening scene of [[Jeff Tremaine]]'s ''[[Jackass Number Two]]'' (2006), in which the cast is chased through a suburban neighbourhood by bulls, is accompanied by this piece. While punk rock band The [[Ramones]] used "The Ecstasy of Gold" as a closing theme during their live performances, [[Metallica]] uses "The Ecstasy of Gold" as the introductory music for its concerts since 1983.<ref>[http://www.metallica.com/index.asp?item=600114 "We All Love Ennio Morricone"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202024236/http://www.metallica.com/index.asp?item=600114 |date=2 February 2007 }}, Metallica.com, 11 March 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.metallicaworld.co.uk/f_a_q.htm Metallica related F.A.Q.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531020521/http://www.metallicaworld.co.uk/f_a_q.htm |date=31 May 2013 }}, Metallic World, retrieved 22 January 2013</ref> This composition is also included on Metallica's live symphonic album ''[[S&M (album)|S&M]]'' as well as the live album ''[[Live Shit: Binge & Purge]]''.

==== ''Once Upon a Time in the West'' and others ====
{{main|Once Upon a Time in the West (soundtrack)}}

Subsequent to the success of the ''Dollars trilogy'', Morricone also composed the scores for ''Once Upon a Time in the West'' (1968) and Leone's last credited western film ''[[A Fistful of Dynamite]]'' (1971),<ref>{{Cite news|date=18 December 2014|title=Morricone regrets Eastwood rejection|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-30517594|access-date=7 July 2020}}</ref> as well as the score for ''[[My Name Is Nobody]]'' (1973).<ref>{{Cite web|last=Wilcox|first=Felicity|title=Vale Ennio Morricone: a master composer with breathtaking musical range|url=http://theconversation.com/vale-ennio-morricone-a-master-composer-with-breathtaking-musical-range-142082|access-date=7 July 2020|website=The Conversation|language=en}}</ref>

The collaboration with Leone is considered one of the exemplary [[List of noted film director and composer collaborations|collaborations between a director and a composer]]. Morricone's last score for Leone was for his last film, the gangster drama ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]'' (1984). Leone died on 30 April 1989 of a heart attack at the age of 60. Before his death in 1989, Leone was part-way through planning a film on the [[Siege of Leningrad]], set during World War II. By 1989, Leone had been able to acquire {{USD}}100&nbsp;million in financing from independent backers for the war epic. He had convinced Morricone to compose the film score. The project was cancelled when Leone died two days before he was to officially sign on for the film.

In early 2003, Italian filmmaker [[Giuseppe Tornatore]] announced he would direct a film called ''Leningrad''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tandemnews.com/viewstory.php?storyid=3204 |title=Tornatore wants Kidman for Leningrad Oscar-winning Italian director to make World War II movie about Nazi attack of Russia |access-date=10 January 2009 | url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311015636/http://tandemnews.com/viewstory.php?storyid=3204 |archive-date=11 March 2007 }}</ref> The film has yet to go into production and Morricone was cagey as to details on account of Tornatore's superstitious nature.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/arts_n_ideas/article/ennio-morricone-discusses-85th-anniversary-before-moscow-concert/489297.html |title=Aliide Naylor, Ennio Morricone Discusses 85th Anniversary Before Moscow Concert |access-date=11 November 2013}}</ref>

==== Association with Sergio Corbucci and Sergio Sollima ====

Two years after the start of his collaboration with Sergio Leone, Morricone also started to score music for another Spaghetti Western director, [[Sergio Corbucci]]. The composer wrote music for Corbucci's ''[[Navajo Joe]]'' (1966), ''[[The Hellbenders]]'' (1967), ''[[The Mercenary (film)|The Mercenary/The Professional Gun]]'' (1968), ''[[The Great Silence]]'' (1968), ''[[Compañeros (film)|Compañeros]]'' (1970), ''[[Sonny and Jed]]'' (1972), and ''[[What Am I Doing in the Middle of the Revolution?]]'' (1972).<ref name=scian>{{Cite book|last=Sciannameo|first=Franco|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b2_KDwAAQBAJ|title=Reflections on the Music of Ennio Morricone: Fame and Legacy|date=2020|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-1-4985-6901-9|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Hoberman|first=J.|date=28 December 2018|title='68 Rides Again: The Return of Sergio Corbucci|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/28/movies/sergio-corbucci-the-great-silence.html|access-date=7 July 2020|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

In addition, Morricone composed music for the western films by [[Sergio Sollima]], ''[[The Big Gundown]]'' (with [[Lee Van Cleef]], 1966), ''[[Face to Face (1967 film)|Face to Face]]'' (1967), and ''[[Run, Man, Run]]'' (1968), as well as the 1970 crime thriller ''[[Città violenta|Violent City]]'' (with [[Charles Bronson]]) and the [[Poliziotteschi|poliziottesco]] film ''[[Revolver (1973 film)|Revolver]]'' (1973).<ref name=scian/><ref>{{Cite book|last=Spencer|first=Kristopher|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wz2dxDNaEDgC|title=Film and Television Scores, 1950–1979: A Critical Survey by Genre|date=10 January 2014|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5228-6|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last1=Grozdanovic|first1=Nikola|date=10 November 2015|title=The 30 Best Film Scores By Ennio Morricone|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2015/11/the-30-best-film-scores-by-ennio-morricone-106032/|access-date=7 July 2020|website=IndieWire|language=en}}</ref>

====Dramas and political movies====
[[File:Ennio Morricone Cannes 2012.jpg|Morricone in 2012|thumb|upright=0.68|left]]
With Leone's films, Ennio Morricone's name had been put firmly on the map. Most of Morricone's film scores of the 1960s were composed outside the Spaghetti Western genre, while still using Alessandroni's team. Their music included the themes for ''Il Malamondo'' (1964), ''Slalom'' (1965), and ''Listen, Let's Make Love'' (1967). In 1968, Morricone reduced his work outside the movie business and wrote scores for 20 films in the same year. The scores included psychedelic accompaniment for [[Mario Bava]]'s superhero romp ''[[Danger: Diabolik]]'' (1968).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hunt|first=Leon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1H1JDwAAQBAJ|title=Danger: Diabolik|date=20 February 2018|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-85112-1|language=en}}</ref>

Morricone collaborated with [[Marco Bellocchio]] (''[[Fists in the Pocket]]'', 1965), [[Gillo Pontecorvo]] (''[[The Battle of Algiers]]'' (1966), and ''[[Burn! (1969 film)|Queimada!]]'' (1969) with [[Marlon Brando]]), [[Roberto Faenza]] (H2S, 1968), Giuliano Montaldo (''[[Sacco e Vanzetti (1971 film)|Sacco e Vanzetti]]'', 1971), [[Giuseppe Patroni Griffi]] (''[['Tis Pity She's a Whore (film)|'Tis Pity She's a Whore]]'', 1971), Mauro Bolognini (''[[Drama of the Rich]]'', 1974), [[Umberto Lenzi]] (''[[Almost Human (1974 film)|Almost Human]]'', 1974), [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] (''[[Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom]]'', 1975), Bernardo Bertolucci (''[[1900 (film)|Novecento]]'', 1976), and [[Tinto Brass]] (''[[The Key (1983 film)|The Key]]'', 1983).<ref name="Leinberger" />{{rp|115–116}}

In 1970, Morricone wrote the score for ''Violent City''. That same year, he received his first [[Nastro d'Argento]] for the music in ''[[Metti, una sera a cena]]'' ([[Giuseppe Patroni Griffi]], 1969) and his second only a year later for ''[[Sacco e Vanzetti (1971 film)|Sacco e Vanzetti]]'' (Giuliano Montaldo, 1971), in which he collaborated with the legendary American folk singer and activist [[Joan Baez]]. His soundtrack for ''Sacco e Vanzetti'' contains another well-known composition by Morricone, the folk song "[[Here's to You (song)|Here's to You]]", sung by [[Joan Baez]]. For the writing of the lyrics, Baez was inspired by a letter from Bartolomeo Vanzetti: ''"Father, yes, I am a prisoner / Fear not to relay my crime"''. The song became a hit in several countries, selling more than 790,000 copies in France only.<ref>[http://www.infodisc.fr/S_ToutTemps.php?debut=150 Les Meilleures Ventes Tout Temps de 45 T. singles, Here's to You sales in France] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202155511/http://www.infodisc.fr/S_ToutTemps.php?debut=150 |date=2 December 2008 }}, Infodisc, Retrieved 23 January 2013</ref> The song was later included in movies such as ''[[The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou]]''.<ref>[http://musicbrainz.org/release/29d93150-709d-4aaa-8b16-0b3b0913885d The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, Soundtrack Tracklist].

In the beginning of the 1970s, Morricone achieved success with other singles, including ''[[A Fistful of Dynamite]]'' (1971) and ''God With Us'' (1974), having sold respectively 477,000 and 378,000 copies in France only.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infodisc.fr/S_ToutTemps.php?debut=600 |title=InfoDisc : Les 45 T. / Singles les plus vendus en France |publisher=Infodisc.fr |access-date=12 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504224052/http://infodisc.fr/S_ToutTemps.php?debut=600 |archive-date=4 May 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infodisc.fr/S_ToutTemps.php?debut=850 |title=18 |publisher=Infodisc.fr |access-date=12 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103102848/http://www.infodisc.fr/S_ToutTemps.php?debut=850 |archive-date=3 November 2011}}</ref>
<!--
Between 1967 and 1993 the composer had a long-term collaboration with director Mauro Bolognini. Morricone wrote more than 15 film scores for Bolognini, including ''[[Le streghe]]'' (1966), ''[[L'assoluto naturale]]'' (1969), ''[[Un bellissimo novembre]]'' (1969), ''[[Metello]]'' (1970), ''[[Chronicle of a Homicide]]'' (1972), ''[[Libera, My Love]]'' (1973), ''[[Per le antiche scale]]'' (1975), ''[[The Lady of the Camellias (1981 film)|La Dame aux camelias]]'' (1980), ''[[Mosca addio]]'' (1987), ''[[Gli indifferenti]]'' (1988), and ''[[Husband and Lovers]]'' (1992).{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

==== Giallo and Horror ====
Morricone's eclecticism found its way to films in the horror genre, such as the giallo thrillers of [[Dario Argento]], from ''[[The Bird with the Crystal Plumage]]'' (1970), ''[[The Cat o' Nine Tails]]'' (1971), and ''[[Four Flies on Grey Velvet]]'' (1971) to ''[[The Stendhal Syndrome]]'' (1996) and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1998 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1998). His other horror scores include ''[[Nightmare Castle]]'' (1965), ''[[A Quiet Place in the Country]]'' (1968), ''[[The Antichrist (film)|The Antichrist]]'' (1974), ''[[Autopsy (1975 film)|Autopsy]]'' (1975), and ''[[Last Stop on the Night Train|Night Train Murders]]'' (1975).

In addition, Morricone composed music for many popular and cult Italian [[giallo]] films, such as ''[[Senza sapere niente di lei]]'' (1969), ''[[Le foto proibite di una signora per bene|Forbidden Photos of a Lady Above Suspicion]]'' (1970), ''[[A Lizard in a Woman's Skin]]'' (1971), ''[[Cold Eyes of Fear]]'' (1971), ''[[The Fifth Cord]]'' (1971), ''[[Short Night of Glass Dolls]]'' (1971), ''[[Black Belly of the Tarantula]]'' (1971) ''[[My Dear Killer]]'' (1972), ''[[What Have You Done to Solange?]]'' (1972), ''[[Who Saw Her Die?]]'' (1972), and ''[[Spasmo]]'' (1974).

In 1977 Morricone scored [[John Boorman]]'s ''[[Exorcist II: The Heretic]]'' and [[Alberto De Martino]]'s apocalyptic horror film ''[[Holocaust 2000]]'', starring [[Kirk Douglas]]. In 1982 he composed the score for [[John Carpenter]]'s science fiction horror movie ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]''.<ref name=AFI>[http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=67235 From AFI (The American Film Institute)], accessed September 2011.</ref> Morricone's main theme for the film was reflected in [[Marco Beltrami]]'s film's score of [[The Thing (2011 film)|prequel of the 1982 film]], which was released in 2011.

===Hollywood career===
The ''Dollars Trilogy'' was not released in the United States until 1967 when [[United Artists]], who had already enjoyed success distributing the British-produced [[James Bond in film|James Bond]] films in the United States, decided to release Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns. The American release gave Morricone an exposure in America and his film music became quite popular in the United States.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=G2lqIuCFJ_MC&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q=days%20of%20heaven%20terrence%20malick%20ennio%20morricone ''Ennio Morricone's The Good, The Bad And The Ugly: A Film Score Guide''], Charles Leinberger, Scarecrow Press, 1 September 2004</ref>

One of Morricone's first contributions to an American director concerned his music for the religious epic film ''[[The Bible: In the Beginning...]]'' by [[John Huston]]. According to Sergio Miceli's book ''Morricone, la musica, il cinema'', Morricone wrote about 15 or 16&nbsp;minutes of music, which were recorded for a screen test and conducted by [[Franco Ferrara]]. At first Morricone's teacher [[Goffredo Petrassi]] had been engaged to write the score for the great big-budget epic, but Huston preferred another composer. [[RCA Records]] then proposed Morricone who was under contract with them, but a conflict between the film's producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] and RCA occurred. The producer wanted to have exclusive rights for the soundtrack, while RCA still had the monopoly on Morricone at that time and did not want to release the composer. Subsequently, Morricone's work was rejected because he did not get permission from RCA to work for Dino De Laurentiis alone. The composer reused the parts of his unused score for ''The Bible: In the Beginning'' in such films as ''[[The Return of Ringo]]'' (1965) by [[Duccio Tessari]] and Alberto Negrin's ''[[The Secret of the Sahara]]'' (1987).

Morricone never left Rome to compose his music and never learned to speak English. But given that the composer always worked in a wide field of composition genres, from "[[absolute music]]", which he always produced, to "applied music", working as orchestrator as well as conductor in the recording field, and then as a composer for theatre, radio, and cinema, the impression arises that he never really cared that much about his standing in the eyes of Hollywood.<ref>[http://thequietus.com/articles/04050-ennio-morricone-interview-a-fistful-of-dollars-for-a-few-dollars-more-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-once-upon-a-time-in-the-west-the-thing Ennio Morricone Interviewed: John Doran, "Compared To Bach, I'm Practically Unemployed"], Quietus interview, 8 April 2010.</ref>

====1970–1985: From ''Two Mules'' to ''Red Sonja''====

In 1970, Morricone composed the music for [[Don Siegel]]'s ''[[Two Mules for Sister Sara]]'', an American-Mexican western film starring [[Shirley MacLaine]] and Clint Eastwood. The same year the composer also delivered the title theme ''The Men from Shiloh'' for the American Western television series [[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]].<ref name="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xna6GjwSJ0">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xna6GjwSJ0 |title=The Virginian – Season 9 Opening Credits |access-date=18 June 2011}}</ref>

In 1974–1975 Morricone wrote music for ''Spazio 1999'', an Italian-produced compilation movie made to launch the Italian-British television series ''[[Space: 1999]]'',<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://catacombs.space1999.net/main/epguide/t00spazio.html |title=Spazio 1999 Episode Guide- Space: 1999 Catacombs |website=catacombs.space1999.net}}</ref> while the original episodes featured music by [[Barry Gray]].

Two years later he composed the score for the sequel to [[William Friedkin]]'s 1973 film ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', directed by [[John Boorman]]: ''[[Exorcist II: The Heretic]]''. The horror film was a major disappointment at the box office. The film grossed {{USD}}30,749,142 in the United States.<ref name="mojo_2">{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=exorcist2.htm |title=Box Office Information for ''Exorcist II: The Heretic'' |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=10 December 2011}}</ref>

In 1978, the composer worked with [[Terrence Malick]] for ''[[Days of Heaven]]'' starring [[Richard Gere]], for which he earned his first nomination at the Oscars for Best Original Score.<ref>{{Cite web|first=Toyin |last=Owoseje|title=The film scores of Ennio Morricone: Five tracks you need to hear by the late, great composer|url=https://www.cnn.com/style/article/ennio-morricone-prolific-italian-composer-best-music-intl-scli/index.html|access-date=7 July 2020|website=CNN|language=en}}</ref>

Despite the fact that Morricone had produced some of the most popular and widely imitated film music ever written throughout the 1960s and 1970s, ''Days of Heaven'' earned him his first [[Academy Awards|Oscar nomination]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], with his score up against [[Jerry Goldsmith]]'s ''[[The Boys from Brazil (film)|The Boys from Brazil]]'', [[Dave Grusin]]'s ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'', [[Giorgio Moroder]]'s ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]'' (the eventual winner), and [[John Williams]]'s ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]'' at the [[51st Academy Awards|Oscar ceremonies]] in 1979.<ref name="Oscars1979">{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1979 |title=The 51st Academy Awards (1979) Nominees and Winners |access-date=6 October 2011 |work=oscars.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114130539/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/51st-winners.html |archive-date=14 January 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

'''Association with Roland Joffé'''

{{main|The Mission (soundtrack)}}
''The Mission'', directed by Joffé, was about a piece of history considerably more distant, as [[Society of Jesus|Spanish Jesuit]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] see their work undone as a tribe of Paraguayan natives fall within a territorial dispute between the Spanish and Portuguese.

==== Association with De Palma and Levinson ====

On three occasions, Brian De Palma worked with Morricone: ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'' (1987), the 1989 war drama ''[[Casualties of War]]'' and the [[science fiction film]] ''[[Mission to Mars]]'' (2000).<ref name=AFI /> Morricone's score for ''The Untouchables'' resulted in his third nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]].<ref>{{Cite web|first=Justin|last=Chang|date=6 July 2020|title=Appreciation: 'A Fistful of Dollars' to 'The Untouchables': Ennio Morricone made music a movie star|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2020-07-06/ennio-morricone-fistful-of-dollars-untouchables-mission|access-date=7 July 2020|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US}}</ref>

In a 2001 interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', Morricone stated that he had good experiences with De Palma: "De Palma is delicious! He respects music, he respects composers. For ''The Untouchables'', everything I proposed to him was fine, but then he wanted a piece that I didn't like at all, and of course, we didn't have an agreement on that. It was something I didn't want to write – a triumphal piece for the police. I think I wrote nine different pieces for this in total and I said, 'Please don't choose the seventh!' because it was the worst. And guess what he chose? The seventh one. But it really suits the movie."<ref name="Sweeting interview" />

Another American director, Barry Levinson, commissioned the composer on two occasions. First, for the crime-drama ''Bugsy'', starring Warren Beatty, which received ten Oscar nominations,<ref>[http://www.myoscarpredictions.com/film_most_nominations_oscar_history_academy_awards.htm Films list with the most Academy Awards Nominations Of History in the Oscars].

"He doesn't have a piano in his studio, I always thought that with composers, you sit at the piano, and you try to find the melody. There's no such thing with Morricone. He hears a melody, and he writes it down. He hears the orchestration completely done," said Levinson in an interview.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/arts/music/28pare.html | first=Jon | last=Pareles | author-link=Jon Pareles | title=The Maestro of Spaghetti Westerns Takes a Bow | work=The New York Times | date=28 January 2007}}</ref>

None of the aforementioned films were box office successes, but fortunately, Morricone was also commissioned for more successful motion pictures such as ''In the Line of Fire'' (1993) by [[Wolfgang Petersen]], starring Clint Eastwood and [[John Malkovich]], the horror film ''[[Wolf (1994 film)|Wolf]]'' (1994, Mike Nichols), which featured [[Jack Nicholson]] and [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], and ''Bulworth'' by Warren Beatty.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

==== Extensive reuse of his music ====

Besides the 500 original film scores composed by Morricone for movies and television series in a career of over six decades, his music is frequently reused in more than 150 other film projects. Morricone's compositions appeared in the German TV series ''[[Derrick (TV series)|Derrick]]'' (1989), the live-action comedy film ''[[Inspector Gadget (film)|Inspector Gadget]]'' (1999), ''[[Ally McBeal]]'' (2001), ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (2002), ''[[The Sopranos]]'' (2001–2002) and more recently in ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' (2010).{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

===Composer for Giuseppe Tornatore===

In 1988, Morricone started an ongoing and very successful collaboration with Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore. His first score for Tornatore was for the drama film ''Cinema Paradiso''. The international version of the film won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Special Jury Prize]] at the [[1989 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref name="festival-cannes.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/236/year/1989.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Cinema Paradiso |access-date=1 August 2009 |work=festival-cannes.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820055739/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/236/year/1989.html |archive-date=20 August 2011}}</ref> and the 1989 [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]. Morricone received a [[BAFTA]] award with his son [[Andrea Morricone|Andrea]], and a [[David di Donatello]] for his score. In 2002, the [[director's cut]] 173-minute version was released (known in the US as ''Cinema Paradiso: The New Version'').<ref name="Brigden" />
After the success of ''Cinema Paradiso'', the composer wrote the music for all subsequent films by Tornatore: the drama film ''[[Everybody's Fine (1990 film)|Everybody's Fine]]'' (Stanno Tutti Bene, 1990), ''[[A Pure Formality]]'' (1994) starring [[Gérard Depardieu]] and Roman Polanski, ''[[The Star Maker (1995 film)|The Star Maker]]'' (1995), ''[[The Legend of 1900]]'' (1998) starring [[Tim Roth]], the 2000 romantic drama ''[[Malèna (soundtrack)|Malèna]]'' (which featured [[Monica Bellucci]]) and the psychological thriller mystery film ''[[La sconosciuta]]'' (2006). Morricone also composed the scores for ''[[Baarìa (film)|Baarìa]]'' (2009), ''[[The Best Offer]]'' (2013) starring [[Geoffrey Rush]], [[Jim Sturgess]] and [[Donald Sutherland]] and the romantic drama ''[[The Correspondence]]'' (2015)<ref name="Brigden">Charlie Brigden: [https://www.rogerebert.com/tributes/ennio-morricone-1928-2020 Ennio Morricone: 1928–2020] rogerebert.com & July 2020</ref><!-- starring [[Jeremy Irons]] and [[Olga Kurylenko]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}} -->

The composer won several music awards for his scores in Tornatore's movies. Morricone received a fifth Academy Award nomination and a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for ''Malèna''. For ''Legend of 1900'', he won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]].<ref name="Bizio">Bizio, Silvio: [https://www.goldenglobes.com/articles/memoriam-ennio-morricone-golden-globe-winner-1928-2020 In Memoriam: Ennio Morricone, Golden Globe Winner, 1928–2020] goldenglobes.com 6 July 2020</ref>

With an estimated 13 million viewers, ''[[Karol: A Man Who Became Pope]]'' became an incredible success. Morricone wrote additional music for the sequel, ''[[Karol: The Pope, The Man]]'' (2006), which portrayed Karol's life as Pope from his [[papal inauguration]] to his death. Both scores were originally released respectively in 2005 and 2006. One year later, a double-disc album with both scores is released.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}-->

[[File:WP2015 EnnioMorricone FFM.jpg|thumb|right|Morricone in the [[Festhalle Frankfurt]] in 2015]]
Before receiving his diplomas in trumpet, composition and instrumentation from the conservatory, Morricone was already active as a trumpet player, often performing in an orchestra that specialised in music written for films. After completing his education at [[Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia|Saint Cecilia]], the composer honed his orchestration skills as an arranger for Italian radio and television. In order to support himself, he moved to RCA in the early sixties and entered the front ranks of the Italian recording industry.<ref>{{cite book |author=Charles Leinberger |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G2lqIuCFJ_MC&pg=PA1 |title=Ennio Morricone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly: A Film Score Guide, p.2 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2004 |isbn=9780810851320 |access-date=22 September 2013}}</ref> Since 1964, Morricone was also a founding member of the Rome-based avant-garde ensemble [[Gruppo di Improvvisazione Nuova Consonanza]]. During the existence of the group (until 1978), Morricone performed several times with the group as trumpet player.<ref>{{cite web |title="Niente" Gruppo Improvvisazione NUOVA CONSONANZA |url=http://www.cometaedizionimusicali.it/niente.htm |website=www.cometaedizionimusicali.it |access-date=7 July 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

To ready his music for live performance, he joined smaller pieces of music together into longer [[Suite (music)|suites]]. Rather than single pieces, which would require the audience to applaud every few minutes, Morricone thought the best idea was to create a series of suites lasting from 15 to 20 minutes, which form a sort of [[symphony]] in various [[Movement (music)|movements]] – alternating successful pieces with personal favourites.
