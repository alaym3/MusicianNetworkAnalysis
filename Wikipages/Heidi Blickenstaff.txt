== Career ==

Blickenstaff is a Broadway performer who gained widespread notice for her work in ''[title of show]'' after some years of working in understudy, supporting, and ensemble roles.<ref name="nyt">{{Cite web|last=Isherwood|first=Charles|date=18 July 2008|title=Puttin' on the Put-On, With Tunes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/18/theater/reviews/18titl.html?ref=theater|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=24 July 2008|website=The New York Times}}</ref> The musical documents its own creation by Broadway fans [[Jeff Bowen]] and [[Hunter Bell]], who want to enter the [[New York Musical Theatre Festival]] and struggle to complete the show in three and a half weeks with their two actress friends. The actors are also the writers and characters of the musical. Blickenstaff has said her character in ''[title of show]'', a struggling actor also named "Heidi", is a "concentrated version" of her actual personality.<ref name="playbill">{{Cite web|last=Gans|first=Andrew|date=11 July 2008|title=DIVA TALK: Chatting with ''[title of show]'''s Heidi Blickenstaff Plus ''Heights'' and ''Pacific'' on CD|url=https://www.playbill.com/article/diva-talk-chatting-with-title-of-show-s-heidi-blickenstaff-plus-heights-and-pacific-on-cd-com-151584|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 January 2021|website=Playbill}}</ref>

She also has credited her experience in ''[title of show]'' with easing her chronic stage fright, a form of self-doubt immortalized in one of the show's songs, "Die Vampire Die". "I also have a stage fright vampire", she told TheaterMania in 2006, during ''[title of show]'''s extended off-Broadway run at the [[Vineyard Theatre]]. "Certainly, ''[title of show]'' has been great medicine, because we talk about that stuff."<ref name="theatermania">{{Cite web|last=Portantiere|first=Michael|date=19 July 2006|title=''Show'' Girls|url=https://www.theatermania.com/new-york-city-theater/news/show-girls_8653.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 January 2021|website=TheaterMania}}</ref>

Of Blickenstaff's performance in the musical—an adaptation of the 1941 [[Frank Capra]] [[Meet John Doe|film]] of the same name—Peter Marks wrote in the ''Washington Post'': "She's a dynamite successor to the movie's Barbara Stanwyck: It's a star performance, in fact.
