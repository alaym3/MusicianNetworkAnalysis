On 30 July 2015, SM Entertainment filed a lawsuit against Wu and the Chinese companies working with him at the Beijing court, stating that "these activities have infringed the rights of the EXO members and SM, and have caused great financial harm to us and our partners. This is not only an abuse of the system, but also an unethical move that has betrayed the trust of this company and the other members."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nate.com/view/20150731n13651?mid=n0107|title=SM Entertainment files lawsuit against Kris and companies that hired him|via=[[Naver]]|work=[[Herald Corporation]]|date=31 July 2015|language=ko|access-date=19 March 2017|archive-date=2 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210502055124/https://news.nate.com/view/20150731n13651?mid=n0107|url-status=live}}</ref> The following day, Wu released a statement defending himself stating that SM Entertainment had made him leave the group for several months and that SM Entertainment's way of mistreating and neglecting their artists resulted in serious health issues: he had to take medication to be able to work from July 2013 to January 2014, when he was diagnosed with [[myocarditis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://star.mt.co.kr/view/stview.php?no=2015080110043393491&type=1&outlink=1|title=Kris (Wu Yi Fan) Releases Official Statement in Response to SM Entertainment's Lawsuit|last=ddangha|website=Star News|date=1 August 2015|language=ko|access-date=19 March 2017|archive-date=20 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320143642/http://star.mt.co.kr/view/stview.php?no=2015080110043393491&type=1&outlink=1|url-status=live}}</ref> A settlement was reached that he will be under their management in only Korea and Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://osen.mt.co.kr/article/G1110460497|title=Ex Exo Members Kris and Luhan settle disputes with SM|work=Osen|date=21 July 2016|language=ko|access-date=19 March 2017|archive-date=20 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320145305/http://osen.mt.co.kr/article/G1110460497|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Sexual abuse allegations and arrest ===
{{main|Kris Wu sex scandal}}
On 8 July 2021, Du Meizhu, a 19-year old Chinese college student, posted allegations online accusing Wu of a pattern of sexual assault involving multiple women, some underage, while they are unconscious and under the influence of alcohol. Through the Chinese social media platform [[Sina Weibo|Weibo]], she stated she was raped under intoxication at age 17 and that she speaks for at least seven other victims, two of whom were minors at the time of the crime.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2021-07-19|title=Kris Wu: Brands drop Chinese star over teen sex allegations|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-57884438|access-date=2021-07-19}}</ref>

The allegations were denied by Wu, though it was later revealed that Wu's team attempted to silence the accusers with [[Hush money|hush payments]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sng |first1=Suzanne |title=Singer Kris Wu denies luring underaged girls with acting and singing offers |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/singer-kris-wu-denies-luring-underaged-girls-with-acting-and-singing-offers |access-date=19 July 2021 |work=The Straits Times |date=11 July 2021}}</ref> The alleged sex crimes are currently under investigation by the Beijing Public Security Bureau and other authorities.
