'''Bijelo Dugme''' (trans. ''White Button'') was a [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[rock music|rock]] band, formed in [[Sarajevo]], [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|SR Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1974. Bijelo Dugme is widely considered to have been the most popular band ever to exist in the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and one of the most important acts of the [[Yugoslav rock scene]].

Bijelo Dugme was officially formed in 1974, although the members of the default lineup, guitarist [[Goran Bregović]], vocalist [[Željko Bebek]], drummer [[Ipe Ivandić]], keyboardist [[Vlado Pravdić]] and bass guitarist [[Zoran Redžić]], were previously active under the name [[Jutro]]. The band's debut album ''[[Kad bi bio bijelo dugme]]'', released in 1974, brought them nationwide popularity with its [[The Balkans|Balkan]] [[Folk music|folk]]-influenced [[hard rock]] sound. The band's future several releases, featuring similar sound, maintained their huge popularity, described by the media as "Dugmemania", and the band's work, especially their [[Symphonic rock|symphonic]] ballads with poetic lyrics, was also widely praised by the critics. In the early 1980s, with the emergence of [[New wave music in Yugoslavia|Yugoslav new wave scene]], the band moved towards [[New wave music|new wave]], managing to remain one of the most popular bands in the country. After the departure of Bebek in 1983, the band was joined by vocalist [[Mladen Vojičić Tifa]], with whom the band recorded only one, but memorable [[Bijelo Dugme (album)|self-titled album]]. The band's last vocalist, [[Alen Islamović]], joined the band in 1986, and with him Bijelo Dugme recorded two albums, disbanding, with the rising tensions in Yugoslavia, in 1989. In 2005, the band reunited in the lineup that featured most of the musicians that passed through the band, including all three vocalists, for three concerts, in Sarajevo, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]] and in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]], the concert in Belgrade being one of the [[List of highest-attended concerts|highest-attended ticketed concerts of all time]].

==History==

===The beginnings (1969–73)===

====Kodeksi (1969–71)====
The band's history begins in 1969. At the time, the future leader of Bijelo Dugme, [[Goran Bregović]], was the bass guitarist in the band Beštije (trans. ''The Beasts'').<ref name="janjatović31">{{cite book|last=Janjatović|first=Petar|title= EX YU ROCK enciklopedija 1960–2006|year=2007|publisher=self-released|location=Belgrade|page=31}}</ref> He was spotted by [[Kodeksi]] (''The [[Codex]]es'') vocalist [[Željko Bebek]]. As Kodeksi needed a bass guitarist, on Bebek's suggestion, Bregović became a member of the band.<ref name="janjatović31"/> The band's lineup consisted of Ismeta Dervoz (vocals), Edo Bogeljić (guitar), Željko Bebek (rhythm guitar and vocals), Goran Bregović (bass guitar), and Luciano Paganotto (drums).<ref name="janjatović31"/> At the time, the band [[Pro Arte]] was also interested in hiring Bregović, but he decided to stay with Kodeksi.<ref name="janjatović31"/> After performing in a night club in [[Dubrovnik]], Kodeksi were hired to perform in a club in [[Naples]], [[Italy]].<ref name="janjatović31"/> However, the parents of the only female member, Ismeta Dervoz, did not allow her to go to Italy.<ref name="vesić27">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=27}}</ref> In Naples, the band initially performed covers of songs by [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and the [[Jimi Hendrix Experience]], but were soon asked to perform music more suitable for night clubs.<ref name="vesić28">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=28}}</ref> After two months, the band's guitarist Edo Bogeljić returned to Sarajevo to continue his studies, and Bregović switched to guitar.<ref name="vesić28"/> Local Italian musician called Fernando Savino was brought in to play the bass,<ref name="vesić28"/> but after he quit too, Bebek called up old friend [[Zoran Redžić]], formerly of the band Čičak (''[[Burdock]]'').<ref name="janjatović31"/> Redžić in turn brought along his bandmate from Čičak [[Milić Vukašinović]] as replacement on drums for Paganotto, who also quit in the meantime.<ref name="janjatović31"/> Vukašinović brought new musical influences along the lines of what [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Black Sabbath]] were doing at the time. Additionally, he convinced Bregović, Bebek and Redžić on incorporating the new sound into their set,<ref name="janjatović31"/> and within two weeks of his arrival, Kodeksi were fired from all the places they were playing.<ref name="janjatović31"/>

The foursome of Bebek, Bregović, Redžić and Vukašinović stayed on the island of [[Capri]] and in 1970 relocated back to Naples.<ref name="janjatović31"/> At this time, the other three members persuaded Bebek to stop playing the rhythm guitar reasoning that it was not fashionable any more.<ref name="janjatović31"/> Bebek also had trouble adapting to the new material vocally. He would sing the intro on most songs and then step back as the other three members improvised for the remainder of songs, with Vukašinović taking the vocal duties more and more often.<ref name="janjatović31"/> After being a key band member only several months earlier, Bebek thought his role was gradually being reduced.<ref name="janjatović31"/> During the fall of 1970, he left Kodeksi to return to Sarajevo.<ref name="janjatović31"/>

Vukašinović, Bregović, and Redžić continued to perform, but had to return to Sarajevo in the spring of 1971, when Bregović's mother and Redžić's brother came to Italy to bring them back.<ref name="janjatović31"/> Upon returning, the trio had only one concert in Sarajevo, performing under the name Mića, Goran i Zoran (''Mića, Goran and Zoran''). At the concert, they performed covers of songs by Cream, Jimi Hendrix Experience, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, [[Deep Purple]], [[Ten Years After]], [[Taste (Irish band)|Taste]], [[Free (band)|Free]], and managed to thrill the audience.<ref name="vesić31">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=31}}</ref> Soon after, the trio got the opportunity to appear in a Television Sarajevo show, but under the condition that they record a song of their own.<ref name="vesić32">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=32}}</ref> Hastily composed and recorded "Ja i zvijezda sjaj" ("Me and the Stars' Glow") was of poor quality and little artistic value,<ref name="vesić32"/> which influenced Vukašinović's decision to move to London.<ref name="vesić32"/> He left Sarajevo in late summer of 1971, and the trio ended their activity.<ref name="janjatović31"/>

====Jutro (1971–73)====
At the autumn of 1971, guitarist Ismet Arnautalić invited Bregović to form [[Jutro]] (''Morning'').<ref name="janjatović31"/> The band's lineup featured, alongside Arnautalić and Bregović, Redžić on bass, Gordan Matrak on drums and vocalist Zlatko Hodnik.<ref name="janjatović31"/> Bregović wrote his first songs as a member of Jutro.<ref name="janjatović31"/> The band had made some recordings with Hodnik when Bregović decided they needed a vocalist with "more aggressive" vocal style, so he invited Bebek to become the band's new singer.<ref name="vesić35">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=35}}</ref> With Bebek, the band recorded the song "Patim, evo, deset dana" ("I've Been Suffering for Ten Days"), which was, in 1972, released as the B-side of the single "Ostajem tebi" ("I Remain Yours"), which was recorded with Hodnik.<ref name="janjatović31"/> After the song recording, Bebek left the band to serve his mandatory stint in the [[Yugoslav People's Army]], but the rest of the band decided to wait for his return to continue their activity.<ref name="janjatović31"/>

During Bebek's short leave from the army, the band recorded four more songs: "Kad bi' bio bijelo dugme" ("If I Were a White Button"), "U subotu, mala" ("On Saturday, Baby"), "Na vrh brda vrba mrda" (the title being a traditional [[tongue-twister]]) and "Hop-cup" ("Whoopsie Daisy"), the first two appearing on a [[7-inch single]].<ref name="janjatović31"/> Dissatisfied with the music direction the band was moving towards, Arnautalić left the band at the end of 1972, convinced that the right to the name Jutro should belong to him.<ref name="janjatović31"/> For some time, guitarist Midorag "Bata" Kostić, a former member of [[YU Grupa]], rehearsed with the band, but this cooperation was soon ended.<ref name="vesić35"/> YU Grupa were one of the pioneers in combining elements of the [[traditional music]] of the [[Balkans]] with rock, and Bregović would later state on number of occasions that this cooperation influenced Bijelo Dugme's [[folk rock]] sound.<ref name="janjatović31"/> After Matrak left the band, he was replaced by Perica Stojanović, who was shortly after replaced by former [[Pro Arte]] member Vladimir Borovčanin "Šento".<ref name="vesić38">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=38}}</ref> Borovčanin tried to secure a record contract with [[Jugoton]], but lost faith in his new band after he failed.<ref name="vesić38"/> He and Redžić neglected rehearsals, and both left the band after an argument with Bregović.<ref name="vesić38"/>

Redžić was replaced by Ivica Vinković, who was at the time a regular member of [[Ambasadori]], but was not able to travel with the band on their [[Soviet Union]] tour.<ref name="vesić44">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=44}}</ref> Borovčanin was replaced by former Mobi Dik (''[[Moby Dick]]'') and Rok (''Rock'') member [[Ipe Ivandić|Goran "Ipe" Ivandić]].<ref name="vesić44"/> Instead of second guitar, Bregović decided to include keyboards in the band's new lineup. Experienced [[Vlado Pravdić]], a former member of [[Ambasadori]] and [[Indexi]], became Jutro's keyboardist.<ref name="vesić43">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=43}}</ref> The band prepared several songs for the recording in [[Radio Sarajevo]]'s studio, but Arnautalić pulled his connections, and Jutro's recording sessions were cancelled.<ref name="vesić44"/> However, the band managed to make an agreement with producer Nikola Borota Radovan, who allowed them to secretly record the songs "Top" ("Cannon") and "Ove ću noći naći blues" ("This Night I'll Find the [[Blues]]") in the studio.<ref name="vesić44"/> The intro to "Top" was inspired by traditional [[Ganga (music)|ganga music]].<ref name="vesić48">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=48}}</ref> Soon after, Vinković rejoined Ambasadori, and was replaced by [[Jadranko Stanković]], a former member of Sekcija (''Section'') and Rok.<ref name="vesić45">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=45}}</ref>

At this time, the band adopted the name Bijelo Dugme. They decided to change the name because of the conflict with Aranautalić,<ref name="vesić45"/> but also because of the existence of another, [[Ljubljana]]-based band with the name [[Jutro (Ljubljana band)|Jutro]].<ref name="janjatović31"/> As the band was already known for the song "Kad bi' bio bijelo dugme", they choose the name Bijelo Dugme.<ref name="janjatović31"/> The band officially started working under this name from January 1974.<ref name="janjatović31"/>

[[File:Bijelo dugme.png|thumb|upright|Bijelo Dugme logo, designed by the band's long-time collaborator Dragan S. Stefanović]]
In January 1974, with Borota, the band finished their work on the "Top" and "Ove ću noći naći blues" recordings.<ref name="vesić47">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=47}}</ref> The band and Borota offered these recordings to the Sarajevo-based record label [[Diskoton]]. The label's top executive Slobodan Vujović refused them, stating that there was already a great number of signed acts and that Bijelo Dugme would have to wait for at least six months for the single to be released.<ref name="janjatović31"/><ref name="vesić47"/> This is widely considered the greatest business mistake in the history of Yugoslav record publishing.<ref name="janjatović31"/><ref name="vesić47"/> On the same day the band were refused by Diskoton, they were offered a five-year contract with [[Zagreb]]-based [[Jugoton]].<ref name="vesić47"/> On 29 March 1974, "Top" and "Ove ću noći naći blues" were released on a [[7-inch single]].<ref name="vesić48"/> Bijelo Dugme's first release would be sold in 30,000 copies.<ref name="vesić49">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=49}}</ref>

The band started promoting the single, performing mostly in smaller towns.<ref name="janjatović31"/> Stanković, unsatisfied with the agreement that only Bregović would compose the band's songs and feeling he did not fit in with the rest of the members, continued to perform with Bijelo Dugme, but avoided any deeper relations.<ref name="vesić53">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=53}}</ref> Soon after, Bregović, Bebek, Ivandić and Pravdić decided to exclude him from the band.<ref name="vesić54">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=54}}</ref> Redžić was invited to join the band, which he accpeted, despite his previous conflict with Bregović.<ref name="vesić54"/> The following 7-inch single, featuring songs "Glavni junak jedne knjige" ("The Main Character of a Book"), with lyrics written by poet [[Duško Trifunović]], and "Bila mama Kukunka, bio tata Taranta" ("There Was Mommy Kukunka, There Was Daddy Taranta"), was almost at the same time released by both Jugoton and Diskoton, as Bregović signed contracts with both of the labels.<ref name="janjatović31"/> This scandal brought huge press covering and increased the record sale.<ref name="janjatović31"/>

The band had their first bigger performance at the 1974 [[BOOM Festival]] in [[Ljubljana]], where they were announced as "the new hopes".<ref name="janjatović31"/> The live version of "Ove ću noći naći blues" appeared on the double live album ''Pop Festival Ljubljana '74 – BOOM''.<ref name="vesić54"/> This was also Bijelo Dugme's first performance on which the members of the group appeared in their [[glam rock]] outfits, which brought them new attention of the media.<ref name="vesić54"/> The band spent the summer performing in [[Cavtat]] and preparing songs for their first album.<ref name="janjatović31"/> They soon released their third single, with the songs "Da sam pekar" ("If I Was a Baker") and "Selma".<ref name="janjatović31"/> "Da sam pekar" was musically inspired by the traditional "[[Kolo (dance)|deaf kolo]]", while "Selma", with lyrics written by poet [[Vlado Dijak]], was a hard rock ballad.<ref name="vesić57">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=57}}</ref> Over 100,000 copies of the single were sold, becoming Bijelo Dugme's first [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]].<ref name="vesić58">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=58}}</ref>

During September, the band performed as the opening band for [[Tihomir Pop Asanović|Tihomir "Pop" Asanović]]'s Jugoslovenska Pop Selekcija, and during the October, in studio Akademik in Ljubljana, they recorded their debut album ''[[Kad bi' bio bijelo dugme]]''.<ref name="janjatović31"/> Several days before the album release, wanting to appear in the media as much as possible, Bijelo Dugme performed at the [[Skopje]] Festival, playing the song "Edna nadež" ("One Hope") by composer Grigor Koprov.<ref name="vesić60">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=60}}</ref> Bregović later described this event as "the greatest disgrace in Bijelo Dugme's career".<ref name="janjatović31"/> Bebek sung in bad [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], and the band did not fit in well in the ambient of a pop festival.<ref name="janjatović31"/> On the next evening, the band performed, alongside [[Pop Mašina]], [[Smak]] and [[Crni Biseri]], in [[Belgrade]]'s [[Dom Sindikata|Trade Union Hall]], on the [[Radio Belgrade]] show ''Veče uz radio'' (''Evening by the Radio'') anniversary celebration, and managed to win the audience's attention.<ref name="janjatović32">{{cite book|last=Janjatović|first=Petar|title= EX YU ROCK enciklopedija 1960–2006|year=2007|publisher=self-released|location=Belgrade|page=32}}</ref> At the time, Bijelo Dugme cooperated with manager Vladimir Mihaljek, who managed to arrange the band to perform as an opening band on [[Korni Grupa]]'s farewell concert in Sarajevo's [[Skenderija]], which won them new fans, as about 15,000 people in the audience were thrilled with Bijelo Dugme's performance.<ref name="janjatović32"/>

''[[Kad bi' bio bijelo dugme]]'', featuring a provocative cover designed by Dragan S. Stefanović (who would also design covers for the band's future releases), saw huge success.<ref name="janjatović32"/> It brought a number of commercial [[hard rock]] songs with folk music elements, which were described as "pastirski rok" (''shepherd rock'') by journalist Dražen Vrdoljak.<ref name="janjatović32"/> This term was (and still is) sometimes used by the Yugoslav critics to classify Bijelo Dugme's sound.<ref>[http://www.mvinfo.hr/izdvojeno-kolumna-opsirnije.php?ppar=180 Jurica Pavičić – "Bijelo dugme", ''Jutarnji list'']</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Bregovićevi uzori opet jašu |url=http://www.muzika.hr/clanak/25021/albumi/yu-grupa-the-ultimate-collection-bregovicevi-uzori-opet-jasu.aspx |publisher=Muzika.hr |access-date=25 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723225204/http://www.muzika.hr/clanak/25021/albumi/yu-grupa-the-ultimate-collection-bregovicevi-uzori-opet-jasu.aspx |archive-date=23 July 2011 }}</ref> The album featured the new version of "Kad bi' bio bijelo dugme", "Patim, evo, deset dana", "Sve ću da ti dam samo da zaigram" ("I Will Give Everything to You Only to Dance"), ballad "Selma", [[blues]] track "Blues za moju bivšu dragu" ("Blues for My Former Darling") and [[rock and roll]]-influenced hit "Ne spavaj, mala moja, muzika dok svira" ("Don't You Sleep, Baby, while the Music Is Playing").<ref name="janjatović32"/> Immediately after the release, the album broke the record for the best selling Yugoslav rock album, previously held by [[YU Grupa]]'s [[YU Grupa (1973 album)|debut album]], which was sold in more than 30,000 copies.<ref name="janjatović32"/> In February 1975, Bijelo Dugme was awarded a [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]] at the [[Opatija]] Festival, as they, up to that moment, sold their debut album in more than 40,000 copies. The final number of copies sold was about 141,000.<ref name="janjatović32"/>

In late February 1975, Mihaljek organized Kongres rock majstora (''Congress of Rock Masters''), an event conceptualized as a competition between the best Yugoslav guitarists at the time.<ref name="janjatović32"/> Although [[Smak]] guitarist [[Radomir Mihajlović Točak]] left the best impression on the gathered crowd, he was not officially recognized due to his band not being under contract with [[Jugoton]], a record label that financially supported the competition.<ref name="janjatović32"/> Instead, [[Vedran Božić]] (of [[Time (rock band)|Time]]), [[Josip Boček]] (formerly of [[Korni Grupa]]), [[Bata Kostić]] (of [[YU Grupa]]), and Bregović were proclaimed the best.<ref name="janjatović32"/> Each of them got to record one side on the ''[[Kongres rock majstora]]'' double album.

Bijelo Dugme is a peak of a wave of youth [[subculture]]. In this country also exist the [[League of Communist Youth of Yugoslavia|League of Socialist Youth]], the Institute for Social Issues, musical experts, serious publicists and press, radio and television. But neither institutions neither individuals had the courage (although they have interest) to establish the counterpoint to roistering advertising through something every society must have – through critical conscience. Not in order to execute or to anathematize, but in order to knowingly cover social life. Faced with the masquerade, the electronic music, the vulgar lyrics, society's scientific minds pushed their heads deep into sand.|source=-Sergije Lukač<br />''[[NIN (magazine)|NIN]]''<br />March 28, 1976<ref name="krstulovic28">{{cite book|last=Krstulović|first=Zvonimir|title= Bijelo Dugme: Doživjeti stotu|year=2005|publisher=Profil|page=28}}</ref>|align=left|width=25%}}
{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center|quote=Energy, as we know, can not be lost, although it often seemed to me that today's youth had lost it. More and more young chairwarmers appeared, ready to ape the older ones [...] In [[Dom Sportova]], that pure energy of youth appeared in a fascinating form, equal to the concrete colossus in which it emerged, but collectively subjected to rock syntax.

That sort of joy and that sort of spontaneity, that sort of sensitivity and that sort of togetherness are possible only with creative spirits, which do not bargain for their position, but simply share it with the others, the same, the equal. With the sounds that tear to pieces everything that does not subject to them (I myself felt minced), with blinding games of light, in the whirlpool of young bodies uncaring for their small spot, an event which will be remembered was created, an event which, in my opinion, Bijelo Dugme only accidentally set in motion.

That event was in the air, as a need of one generation of teenagers pinched between existing tepid culture and imperatives of their young nature. The instruments of Bijelo Dugme were only the electric lighter for those explosive masses, which started the run for their mythology, their culture, their values...

The generation which found its Bijelo Dugme will more likely find its [[Bach]] than the generation for which Bach is a social norm, the generation which is dressed in its formal suit and locked in its concert chair.|source=-Veselko Tendžera<br />''[[Vjesnik]]''<br />March 28, 1976<ref name="nistamudro">{{cite book|last1=Glavan|first1=Darko|last2=Vrdoljak|first2=Dražen|title= Ništa Mudro|year=1981|publisher=Polet rock|location=Zagreb|page=12}}</ref>|align=right|width=25%}}

In December 1980, Bijelo Dugme released [[New wave music|new wave]]-influenced album ''[[Doživjeti stotu]]'' (''Live to Be 100'').<ref name="janjatović33"/> This was the first Bijelo Dugme album produced by Bregović.<ref name="janjatović33"/> Unlike the songs from the band's previous albums, which were prepared much before the album recording, most of the songs from ''Doživjeti stotu'' were created during the recording sessions.<ref name="vesić190">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=190}}</ref> As the recordings had to be finished before the scheduled mastering in London, Bregović used [[cocaine]] to stay awake, writing the lyrics in the nick of time.<ref name="vesić191">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=191}}</ref> The saxophone on the recording was played by [[jazz]] musician [[Jovan Maljoković]] and [[Avant-garde music|avant-garde]] musician Paul Pignon.<ref name="vesić192">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=192}}</ref> From the songs on ''Doživjeti stotu'', only the new version of "Pristao sam biću sve što hoće" and "Pjesma mom mlađem bratu" ("The Song for My Little Brother") resembled Bijelo Dugme's old sound.<ref name="janjatović33"/> The songs "Ha ha ha" and "Tramvaj kreće (ili kako biti heroj u ova šugava vremena)" ("Streetcar Is Leaving (or How to Be a Hero in These Lousy Times)") were the first Bijelo Dugme songs to feature political-related lyrics.<ref name="janjatović33"/> The provocative cover designed by [[Mirko Ilić]], an artist closely associated with Yugoslav new wave scene, appeared in three versions.<ref name="janjatović33"/> In accordance with their shift towards new wave, the band changed their [[hard rock]] style: the members cut their hair short, and the frontman [[Željko Bebek]] shaved his trademark [[mustache]].<ref name="krstulovic35">{{cite book|last=Krstulović|first=Zvonimir|title= Bijelo Dugme: Doživjeti stotu|year=2005|publisher=Profil|page=35}}</ref> Due to new sound, the album was met with a lot of skepticism, but most of the critics ended up praising the album.<ref name="krstulovic35"/> At the end of 1980, the readers of ''[[Džuboks]]'' magazine polled Bijelo Dugme the Band of the Year, Bebek the Singer of the Year, Pravdić the Keyboardist of the Year, Jankelić the Drummer of the Year, Redžić the Bass Guitarist of the Year, Bregović the Composer, the Lyricist, the Producer and the Arranger of the Year, ''Doživjeti stotu'' the Album of the Year, and ''Doživjeti stotu'' cover the Album Cover of the Year.<ref name="krstulovic35"/>

The band started their Yugoslav tour on 24 February 1981 of the following year, with a concert in Sarajevo, and ended it with a concert in the club [[Kulušić]] in Zagreb, on which they recorded their second live album, ''[[5. april '81]]'' (''5 April 1981'').<ref name="janjatović33"/> The album, featuring a cover of [[Indexi]] song "Sve ove godine" ("All These Years"), was released in a limited number of 20,000 copies.<ref name="janjatović33"/> Bijelo Dugme performed in Belgrade several times during the tour: after two concerts in Pionir Hall, they performed, alongside British band [[Iron Maiden]] and Yugoslav acts [[Atomsko Sklonište]], [[Divlje Jagode]], [[Film (band)|Film]], [[Aerodrom (band)|Aerodrom]], [[Slađana Milošević]], [[Siluete]], [[Haustor]], [[Kontraritam]] and others, on the two-day festival Svi marš na ples!

At the end of 1982, Ivandić was released from prison and was approached to rejoin the band.

====After ''Doživjeti stotu'', Bebek's departure (1983–84)====
At the beginning of 1983 Bijelo Dugme recorded a [[children's music]] album ''[[...a milicija trenira strogoću! (i druge pjesmice za djecu)]]'' (''...and Police Trains Strictness! (and Other Songs for Children)''). The lyrics for the album were written by Duško Trifunović.<ref name="janjatović34"/> It was initially planned pop rock singer [[Seid Memić|Seid Memić "Vajta"]] to sing, but eventually vocals were recorded by the eleven-year-old [[Ratimir Boršić|Ratimir Boršić "Rača"]], and the album was released under Ratimir Boršić Rača & Bijelo Dugme moniker.<ref name="janjatović34"/>

In February 1983, the band released the album ''[[Uspavanka za Radmilu M.]]'' (''Lullaby for Radmila M.'').<ref name="janjatović34"/> Bregović intended to release ''Uspavanka za Radmilu M.'' as Bijelo Dugme's farewell album and to dismiss the band after the tour.<ref name="janjatović34"/> The album was recorded in [[Skopje]] and featured [[Vlatko Stefanovski]] (guitar), Blagoje Morotov (double bass) and Arsen Ereš (saxophone) as guest musicians.<ref name="janjatović34"/> The songs "Ako možeš zaboravi" ("Forget, if You Can"), "U vrijeme otkazanih letova" ("In the Time of Canceled Flights"), "Polubauk polukruži poluevropom" ("Half-Spectre is Half-Haunting Half-Europe", the title referring to the first sentence of ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'') and "Ovaj ples dame biraju" ("Ladies' Choice") featured diverse sound, illustrating various phases in the band's career.<ref name="janjatović34"/> The album's title track is the only instrumental track Bijelo Dugme ever recorded.<ref name="janjatović34"/> Unlike the band's previous album, ''Uspavanka za Radmilu M.'' was not followed by a large promotion in the media.<ref name="vesić210">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=210}}</ref> The release of the album was followed by the release of the [[VHS|videotape cassette]] ''Uspavanka za Radmilu M.'', which featured videos for all the songs from the album. It was the first project of the kind in the history of Yugoslav rock music.<ref name="vesić218">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=218}}</ref> The videos were directed by Boris Miljković and Branimir Dimitrijević "Tucko".<ref name="vesić217">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=217}}</ref> The video for the song "Ovaj ples dame biraju" was the first gay-themed video in Yugoslavia.<ref name="vesić217"/> The song "Kosovska" ("[[Kosovo]] Song") featured [[Albanian language]] lyrics.<ref name="janjatović34"/> Written during delicate political situation in [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]], the song represented Bregović's effort to integrate the culture of [[Kosovo Albanians]] into Yugoslav rock music.<ref name="vesić214">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=214}}</ref> Although lyrics were simple, dealing with rock music, the song caused certain controversies.<ref name="janjatović34"/><ref name="vesić214"/>

''Uspavanka za Radmilu M.'' did not bring numerous hits as the band's previous releases, however, the tour was very successful, and the audience's response made Bregović change his mind about dismissing the band.<ref name="janjatović34"/> After the tour, Bijelo Dugme went on a hiatus and Bebek recorded his second solo album, ''Mene tjera neki vrag'' (''Some Devil is Making Me Do It'').<ref name="janjatović34"/> His last concert with Bijelo Dugme was on 13 February 1984, in [[1984 Winter Olympics|Sarajevo Olympic Village]].<ref name="janjatović34"/> Unsatisfied with his share of the profit in Bijelo Dugme, he decided to leave the band and dedicate himself to his solo career.<ref name="vesić227">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=227}}</ref> He left Bijelo Dugme in April 1984, starting a semi-successful solo career.<ref name="janjatović34"/> For a certain period of time, Bebek's backing band would feature Jankelić on drums.<ref name="vesić233">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=233}}</ref>

After Bebek's departure, [[Alen Islamović]], vocalist for the heavy metal band [[Divlje Jagode]], was approached to join the band, but he refused fearing that Bebek might decide to return.<ref name="janjatović34"/> Eventually, the new Bijelo Dugme singer became then relatively unknown [[Mladen Vojičić Tifa|Mladen Vojičić "Tifa"]], a former Top and [[Teška Industrija]] member.<ref name="janjatović34"/> The band spent summer in [[Rovinj]], where they held small performances in Monvi tourist centre, preparing for the upcoming album recording.<ref name="vesić230">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=230}}</ref> At the time, Ivandić started working with the [[synthpop]] band Amila, whose frontess Amila Sulejmanović often performed as a backing vocalist on Bijelo Dugme concerts.<ref name="janjatović34"/>

At the time Bregović, with singer [[Zdravko Čolić]], formed [[Slovenia]]-based record label Kamarad, which co-released Bijelo Dugme's new album with [[Diskoton]].<ref name="janjatović34"/> The album was released in December 1984, entitled simply ''[[Bijelo Dugme (album)|Bijelo Dugme]]'', but is, as the cover featured [[Uroš Predić]]'s painting ''Kosovo Maiden'', also unofficially known as ''Kosovka djevojka'' (''[[Kosovo Maiden]]'').<ref name="janjatović34"/> The album featured both Ristovski and Pravdić on keyboards, and, after the album recording, Ristovski became an official member of the band once again.<ref name="janjatović34"/> ''Bijelo Dugme'' featured folk-oriented [[pop rock]] sound which had, alongside a cover of Yugoslav anthem "[[Hej, Sloveni]]" featured on the album, influenced a great number of bands from Sarajevo, labeled as [[New Partisans]].<ref name="janjatović34"/> The album featured a new version of "Šta ću nano dragi mi je ljut" ("What Can I Do, Mom, My Darling Is Angry"), written by Bregović and originally recorded by [[Bisera Veletanlić]], Bijelo Dugme version entitled "Lipe cvatu, sve je isto k'o i lani" ("[[Tilia|Linden]] Trees Are in Bloom, Everything's just like It Used to Be"), which became the album's biggest hit.<ref name="janjatović34"/> Other hits included "Padaju zvijezde" ("The Stars Are Falling"), "Lažeš" ("You're Lying"), "Da te bogdo ne volim" ("If I Could Only Not Love You") and "Jer kad ostariš" ("Because, When You Grow Old").<ref name="janjatović34"/> The song "Pediculis pubis" (misspelling of "[[Pediculosis pubis]]") featured [[Bora Đorđević]], the leader of Bijelo Dugme's main competitors at the time, [[Riblja Čorba]], on vocals; he co-wrote the song with Bregović and sung it with Bregović and Vojičić.<ref name="janjatović34"/> The album also featured [[Macedonian Radio Television|Radio Television of Skopje]] Folk Instruments Orchestra, folk group Ladarice on backing vocals, Pece Atanasovski on [[gaida]] and Sonja Beran-Leskovšek on [[harp]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Bijelo-Dugme-Bijelo-Dugme/release/1351158|title=Bijelo Dugme – Bijelo Dugme|website=Discogs|access-date=28 April 2019}}</ref>

The album was sold in more than 420,000 copies.<ref name="vesić236">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=236}}</ref> The tour was also very successful.<ref name="janjatović34"/> The band held a successful concert at Belgrade Fair in front of some 27,000 people (which was, up to that point, the biggest number of spectators in an indoor concert in Belgrade),<ref name="vesić245">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=245}}</ref> but also performed in clubs on several occasions.<ref name="janjatović34"/> The stylized army uniform in whIch the members of the band appeared on stage and the large [[red star]] from Kamarad logo were partially inspired by the works of [[Laibach (band)|Laibach]].<ref name="vesić237">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=237}}</ref> In the summer of 1985, Bijelo Dugme, alongside [[Bajaga i Instruktori]], represented Yugoslavia at the [[12th World Festival of Youth and Students]] held in Moscow.<ref name="janjatović34"/> The two bands should have held their first concert on 28 July in [[Gorky Park (Moscow)|Gorky Park]].<ref name="vesić247">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=247}}</ref> The [[soundcheck]], during which Yugoslav technicians played [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Pink Floyd]] songs, attracted some 100,000 people to the location.<ref name="vesić248">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=248}}</ref> Bajaga i Instruktori opened the concert, however, after some time, the police started to beat the ecstatic audience, and the concert was interrupted by the Soviet officials, so Bijelo Dugme did not have to opportunity to go out on the stage.<ref name="vesić249">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=249}}</ref> Fearing new riots, the Moscow authorities scheduled the second concert in Dinamo Hall, and the third one in the Moscow Green Theatre. The first one, held on 30 July, was attended by about 2,000 uninterested factory workers, and the second one, held on 2 August, by about 10,000 young activists with special passes.<ref name="vesić249"/>

The concerts in Moscow were Vojičić's last performances with the band. Under the pressure of professional obligations, sudden fame and media scandal in which it was discovered that he uses [[LSD]], he decided to leave the band.<ref name="janjatović34"/> After leaving Bijelo Dugme, Vojičić would first go on a tour with Željko Bebek and the band Armija B, then he would join Vukašinović's band [[Vatreni Poljubac]], then heavy metal band [[Divlje Jagode]] (whose singer Alen Islamović replaced him in Bijelo Dugme), and eventually start a solo career.<ref name="janjatović34"/>

===Alen Islamović years and disbandment (1986–89)===
[[File:Bijelodugmelastlineup.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The last Bijelo Dugme lineup, from left to right: Vlado Pravdić, Ipe Ivandić, Goran Bregović, Alen Islamović, Zoran Redžić and Laza Ristovski]]
After Vojičić's departure, [[Alen Islamović]] was once again approached to join the band. At the time, Islamović's band [[Divlje Jagode]] were based in London, working on their international career under the name Wild Strawberries. Doubting the success of their efforts, Islamović left them and joined Bijelo Dugme.<ref name="janjatović34"/>

The new album, ''[[Pljuni i zapjevaj moja Jugoslavijo]]'' (''Spit and Sing, My Yugoslavia''), was released in 1986. Inspired by [[Yugoslavism]], with numerous references to Yugoslav unity and the lyrics on the inner sleeve printed in both [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] and [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] alphabets, the album featured the already familiar pop rock sound with folk elements.<ref name="janjatović34"/> Bregović originally wanted the album to contain contributions from individuals known for holding political views outside of the official [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|League of Communists]] ideology. To that end he and the band's manager Raka Marić approached three such individuals who were effectively proscribed from public discourse in Yugoslavia: pop singer [[Vice Vukov]], who represented SFR Yugoslavia at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1963|1963 Eurovision Song Contest]] before seeing his career prospects marginalized after being branded a Croatian [[nationalist]] due to his association with the [[Croatian Spring]] political movement; painter and experimental filmmaker [[Mića Popović]], associated with [[Yugoslav Black Wave]] film movement, who got a dissident reputation due to his paintings; politician and diplomat [[Koča Popović]] who, despite a prominent [[World War II]] engagement on the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisan]] side as the [[First Proletarian Brigade]] commander that earned him the [[Order of the People's Hero]] medal, followed by high political and diplomatic appointments in the post-war period, nevertheless got silently removed from public life in 1972 after supporting a liberal faction within the Yugoslav Communist League's [[League of Communists of Serbia|Serbian branch]].<ref name="vesić267">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=267}}</ref> Bregović's idea was to have Vukov sing the ballad "Ružica si bila, sada više nisi" ("You Were Once a Little Rose"). However, despite Vukov accepting, the plan never got implemented after the band's manager Marić got arrested and interrogated by the police at the [[Sarajevo Airport]] upon returning from Zagreb where he met Vukov.<ref name="vesić267"/> Mića Popović's contribution to the album was to be his ''Dve godine garancije'' (''A Two-Year Warranty'') painting featuring a [[pensioner]] sleeping on a park bench while using pages of ''[[Politika]]'' newspaper as [[blanket]] to warm himself, which Bregović wanted to use as the album cover. When approached, Mića Popović also accepted though warning Bregović of possible problems the musician would likely face.<ref name="vesić267"/> Koča Popović was reportedly somewhat receptive to the idea of participating on the album, but still turned the offer down.<ref name="vesić267"/> Eventually, under pressure from Diskoton, Bregović gave up on his original ideas.<ref name="vesić268">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=268}}</ref> A World War II holder of the Order of the People's Hero still appeared on the record, however, instead of Koča Popović, it was [[Svetozar Vukmanović Tempo]]. He, together with Bregović and children from the Ljubica Ivezić orphanage in Sarajevo, sang a cover of "[[Padaj silo i nepravdo]]" ("Fall, (Oh) Force and Injustice"), an old [[revolutionary song]].<ref name="janjatović34"/> Instead of Popović's painting, the album cover featured a photograph of [[China|Chinese]] [[Social realism|social realist]] ballet.<ref name="vesić268"/> Vukmanović's appearance on the album was described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as "some sort of Bregović's coup d'état".<ref name="janjatović34"/> The album's main hits were pop song "Hajdemo u planine" ("Let's Go to the Mountains"), "Noćas je k'o lubenica pun mjesec iznad Bosne" ("Tonight a Moon Full like a Watermelon Is over Bosnia"), ballads "Te noći kad umrem, kad odem, kad me ne bude" ("That Night, When I Die, When I Leave, When I'm Gone") and "Ružica si bila, sada više nisi".<ref name="janjatović34"/> In 1987, Belgrade rock journalist [[Dragan Kremer]], in the show ''Mit mjeseca'' (''Myth of the Month'') on the [[Radiotelevision of Bosnia-Herzegovina|RTV Sarajevo]], expressing his opinion about the band's new direction, tore the album cover, and made Bregović, who appeared in the following edition of the show, very angry, which was one of the larger media scandals of the time.<ref name="janjatović34"/> The incident however, did not affect the album sales. The tour was also very successful, and the concert at Belgrade Fair featured [[opera singer]] [[Dubravka Zubović]] as guest.<ref name="janjatović34"/>

The double live album ''[[Mramor, kamen i željezo]]'' (''Marble, Stone and Iron''), recorded on the tour and produced by Redžić, was released in 1987.<ref name="janjatović34"/> The title song was a cover of a hit by the Yugoslav 1960s [[Beat music|beat]] band [[Roboti (band)|Roboti]].<ref name="janjatović34"/> The album offered a retrospective of the band's work, featuring songs from their first singles to their latest album.<ref name="janjatović34"/> The album featured similar Yugoslavist iconography as the bands' previous two releases: the track "A milicija trenira strogoću" begins with "[[The Internationale]]" melody, during the intro to "Svi marš na ples" Islamović shouts "Bratsvo! Jedinstvo!" ("[[Brotherhood and unity|Brotherhood! Unity!]]"),<ref name="janjatović34"/> and the album cover features a photograph from the 5th Congress of the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Bijelo-Dugme-Mramor-Kamen-I-%C5%BDeljezo/release/920559|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327135221/http://www.discogs.com/Bijelo-Dugme-Mramor-Kamen-I-%C5%BDeljezo/release/920559|url-status=dead|archive-date=27 March 2009|title=Bijelo Dugme – Mramor, Kamen I Željezo (2xLP, Album) at Discogs|date=27 March 2009|access-date=28 April 2019}}</ref> ''Mramor, kamen i željezo'' was the band's last album to feature Vlado Pravdić.

At the end of 1988, the album ''[[Ćiribiribela]]'' was released.<ref name="janjatović35"/> Recorded during the political crisis in Yugoslavia, the album was marked by Bregović's [[Pacifism|pacifist]] efforts: the album cover featured [[Edward Hicks]]' painting ''Noah's Ark'' on the cover, the song "Lijepa naša" ("Our Beautiful") featured the national anthem of Croatia "[[Lijepa naša domovino]]" ("Our Beautiful Homeland") combined with the [[Serbs|Serbian]] traditional [[World War I]] song "[[Tamo daleko]]" ("There, Far Away"),<ref name="janjatović35"/> and the title track featured lyrics about a love couple which decides to "stay at home and kiss" if the war starts.<ref name="krstulovic50">{{cite book|last=Krstulović|first=Zvonimir|title= Bijelo Dugme: Doživjeti stotu|year=2005|publisher=Profil|page=50}}</ref> The album's biggest hit was "Đurđevdan je, a ja nisam s onom koju volim" ("It's [[St. George]]'s Day, and I'm Not with the One I Love'"), based on traditional [[Romani people|Romani]] song "[[Ederlezi (song)|Ederlezi]]" and featuring [[Fejat Sejdić]] Trumpet Orchestra.<ref name="janjatović35"/> Other hits included "Evo zakleću se" ("Here, I'll Make A Vow"), "Ako ima Boga" ("If There Is God"), "Šta ima novo" ("What's New"), "Nakon svih ovih godina" ("After All These Years"), pop-influenced "Napile se ulice" ("The Streets Are Drunk") and [[Dalmatia]]n folk music-inspired "Ćirbiribela".<ref name="janjatović35"/> After the album release, [[Radio-Television Belgrade]] wanted to make a video for the song "Đurđevdan je, a ja nisam s onom koju volim". The original idea was for the video to feature iconography inspired by the [[Serbian Campaign of World War I|Serbian Army in World War I]].<ref name="vesić285">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=285}}</ref> The video was recorded in the village [[Koraćica]] in Central Serbia.<ref name="vesić285"/> The band came to the recording not knowing anything about the video concept.<ref name="vesić286">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=286}}</ref> They should have worn uniforms (without any insignia) and old weapons, but Islamović thought the idea was too "pro-war", so refused to wear a uniform.<ref name="vesić286"/> Eventually, the band and the director reached an agreement: everyone, except Islamović, wore [[Serbian traditional clothing|Serbian traditional costumes]], with only several of the original props used.<ref name="vesić287">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=287}}</ref> However, after the video was recorded, the Radio-Television Belgrade editors themselves decided not to emit it, fearing it might remind of the [[Chetniks|Chetnik movement]].<ref name="vesić287"/>

At the beginning of 1989, the band went on a tour which should have lasted until 1 April.<ref name="janjatović35"/> The concert in Belgrade, held in Belgrade Fair on 4 February, was attended by about 13,000 people.<ref name="vesić291">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=291}}</ref> The concert featured Dubravka Zubović, the First Singing Society of Belgrade, the Fejat Sejdić Trumpet Orchestra and [[klapa]] Trogir.<ref name="vesić291"/> The concert in Sarajevo's Zetra, held on 11 February, was also very successful; it was attended by more than 20,000 people.<ref name="vesić291"/> However, on some concerts in Croatia, the audience booed and threw various objects on stage when the band performed their pro-Yugoslav songs.<ref name="vesić291"/>

After the concert in [[Modriča]], held on 15 March, with four concerts left until the end of the tour, Islamović checked into a hospital with [[kidney]] pains.<ref name="vesić292">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=292}}</ref> This event revealed the existing conflicts inside the band: Bregović claimed that Islamović had no problems during the tour,<ref name="vesić292"/> while the band's manager, Raka Marić, stated that Bijelo Dugme would search for a new singer for the planned concerts in China and Soviet Union.<ref name="vesić293">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=293}}</ref> Bregović went to Paris, leaving Bijelo Dugme's status opened for speculations.<ref name="janjatović35"/> In 1990, the compilation album ''Nakon svih ovih godina'' was released, featuring recordings made between 1984 and 1989.<ref name="janjatović35"/> As [[Yugoslav Wars]] broke out in 1991, it became clear that Bijelo Dugme would not continue their activity.<ref name="janjatović35"/>

===Post-breakup===
Bregović continued his career as a film music composer, cooperating mostly with [[Emir Kusturica]].<ref name="janjatović35"/> Redžić moved to [[Finland]], where he worked as a producer, and after the [[Bosnian War]] ended, he returned to Sarajevo, where he opened a rock club.<ref name="janjatović35"/> After the war broke out, Ivandić went to Belgrade, where he, in 1994, died after falling from the sixth floor of the building in which he lived; the death was believed to be a suicide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=920382|title=Smrt na estradi|website=Nedeljnik Vreme|access-date=28 April 2019}}</ref> Ristovski continued to record solo albums and worked as a studio musician.

In 1994, the double compilation album ''Ima neka tajna veza'' (''There's Some Secret Connection''), featuring [[Dragan Malešević Tapi]]'s painting ''Radost bankrota'' (''The Joy of Bankruptcy'') on the cover, was released.<ref name="janjatović35"/>

===2005 reunion===
Bregović, who during the 1990s became one of the most internationally known modern composers of the [[Balkans]], on numerous occasions stated that he will not reunite Bijelo Dugme.<ref name="janjatović35"/> However, in 2005, Bijelo Dugme reunited, with Goran Bregović on guitar, Željko Bebek, Mladen Vojičić and Alen Islamović on vocals, Zoran Redžić on bass guitar, Milić Vukašinović and Điđi Jankelić on drums and Vlado Pravdić and Laza Ristovski on keyboards.<ref name="janjatović35"/> The reunion saw huge media attention in all former Yugoslav republics,<ref>{{cite book|last=Krstulović|first=Zvonimir|title= Bijelo Dugme: Doživjeti stotu|year=2005|publisher=Profil|page=110}}</ref> followed by various forms of [[yugonostalgia]].<ref name="vesić306">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=306}}</ref>

==Influence and legacy==
{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center|quote=Bijelo Dugme is the most important phenomenon in the last quarter of the 20th century in Yugoslav culture. In a socialist culture, which shyly searched for its path outside of determined framework of values, they were a phenomenon of overturning importance. They promoted the necessity of talent, the exigency of authenticity, the importance of attitude, the need for complete dedication, the high level of professionalism and the modern package. They were the biggest mass concept of Yugoslavia and the first mass concept not financed by the state. During their entire career, they had the endless love of the audience, the constant envy of their colleagues and divided sympathy of the establishment.

They defined rock culture and defined teenagers as an organised category. They fought for the freedom of taste, by then unimaginable in socialism, and won. They were one of the rare [[Capitalism|capitalist]] establishments in former Yugoslavia and the best advertiser of Yugoslavia's freedoms. They lived and worked in accordance to all the attributes of the Western rock culture. There was everything present in all big biographies of rock: big numbers, the euphoria of fans, all the vices (especially sex) except gambling, the inexplicable circumstances and tragic deaths. It is believed that they are the only ones in Yugoslavia who made big money from rock music. They set new standards in the [[entertainment industry]] and kept lifting them up. They fulfilled all the dreams of Yugoslav scene – except one: they did not step out on the world stage side by side with the biggest stars of the time, although they had the capacity to do that. Bijelo Dugme was maybe the biggest collateral damage of the [[Cold War]] when it comes to music: they couldn't go neither to the East, neither to the West. Then again, Bijelo Dugme is the only proof that the classic rock 'n' roll career is possible outside of English language.|source=-Dušan Vesić in 2014<ref name="vesić321">{{cite book|last=Vesić|first=Dušan|title= Bijelo Dugme: Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu|year=2014|publisher=Laguna|location=Belgrade|page=321}}</ref>|align=right|width=33%}}

Bijelo Dugme is generally considered to have been the most popular act ever to appear in SFR Yugoslavia and its successor countries, inspiring many artists from different musical genres.
