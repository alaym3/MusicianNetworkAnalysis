A '''knockout''' (abbreviated to '''KO''' or '''K.O.''') is a fight-ending, winning criterion in several [[full-contact]] [[combat sport]]s, such as [[boxing]], [[kickboxing]], [[Muay Thai|muay thai]], [[mixed martial arts]], [[karate]], some forms of [[World Taekwondo Federation#Sparring|taekwondo]] and other sports involving [[strike (attack)|striking]], as well as [[fighting game|fighting]]-based [[video game]]s. A full knockout is considered any legal strike or combination thereof that renders an opponent unable to continue fighting.

The term is often associated with a sudden traumatic [[loss of consciousness]] caused by a physical blow. Single powerful blows to the head (particularly the jawline and temple) can produce a [[cerebral concussion]] or a [[carotid sinus reflex]] with [[Syncope (medicine)#Blood pressure|syncope]] and cause a sudden, dramatic KO. Body blows, particularly the [[liver punch]], can cause progressive, debilitating pain that can also result in a KO.

In boxing and kickboxing, a knockout is usually awarded when one participant falls to the canvas and is unable to rise to their feet within a specified period of time, typically because of exhaustion, pain, disorientation, or [[unconsciousness]]. For example, if a boxer is knocked down and is unable to continue the fight within a ten-second count, they are counted as having been knocked out and their opponent is awarded the KO victory.

In mixed martial arts (MMA) competitions, no time count is given after a knockdown, as the sport allows [[submission grappling]] as well as [[ground and pound]]. If a fighter loses consciousness ("goes limp") as a result of legal strikes, it is declared a KO.<ref name=ufc>{{cite web|url=http://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations#17|title=Rules and Regulations - Unified Rules and Other MMA Regulations|website=www.ufc.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416102122/http://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations#17|archive-date=2016-04-16}}</ref> Even if the fighter loses consciousness for a brief moment and wakes up again to continue to fight, the fight is stopped and a KO is declared .<ref>http://mixedmartialarts.com/mma-news/341856/Herb-Dean-The-fight-is-over-when-hes-unconscious{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=SheriffIsInTown |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> As many MMA fights can take place on the mat rather than standing, it is possible to score a KO via ground and pound, a common victory for [[grapplers]]. 

In [[fighting games]] such as ''[[Street Fighter]]'' and ''[[Tekken]]'', a player scores a knockout by fully depleting the opponent's [[health bar]], with the victor being awarded the round. The player who wins the most rounds, either by scoring the most knockouts or by having more vitality remaining when time expires during each round, wins the match. This differs from combat sports in reality, where a knockout ends the match immediately. However, some fighting games aim for a more realistic experience, with titles like ''[[Fight Night (video game series)|Fight Night]]'' adhering to the rules of professional boxing, although technically they are classified as [[sports video game|sports games]], and share many of the same features as [[NFL]] and [[NBA]] video games. 

==Technical knockout==
[[File:2017-12-02 Roman Hardok - Jakob Jakobi - DSC2359.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A boxer delivers a knockout blow to his opponent, prompting the referee to stop the fight.]]
A '''technical knockout''' ('''TKO''' or '''T.K.O.'''), or '''stoppage''', is declared when the referee decides during a round that a fighter cannot safely continue the match for any reason.  Certain sanctioning bodies also allow the official attending physician at ringside to stop the fight as well.  In many regions, a TKO is declared when a fighter is knocked down three times in one round.<ref>Sugar, Bert. [http://www.owingsmillsboxingclub.com/boxing.htm Boxing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619215358/http://www.owingsmillsboxingclub.com/boxing.htm |date=2006-06-19 }}. ''www.owingsmillsboxingclub.com''. URL last accessed March 4, 2006.</ref> 

In MMA bouts, the referee may declare a TKO if a fighter cannot intelligently defend him/herself while being repeatedly struck.<ref name=ufc/>

==Double knockout== 
A '''double knockout''', both in real-life [[combat sports]] and in [[fighting game|fighting]]-based [[video game]]s, occurs when both fighters trade blows and knock each other out simultaneously and are both unable to continue fighting. In such cases, the match is declared a draw. In fighting games such as ''[[Street Fighter]]'', ''[[Dead or Alive (franchise)|Dead or Alive]]'', and ''[[Tekken]]'', a draw is counted as a loss for both players.

==Physical characteristics==
[[File:SingletonBox-knockout.jpg|thumb|A knockout can be characterized by unconsciousness.]]
Little is known as to what exactly causes one to be knocked unconscious, but many agree it is related to trauma to the [[Brainstem|brain stem]]. This usually happens when the head rotates sharply, often as a result of a strike. There are three general manifestations of such trauma:
* a typical knockout, which results in a sustained (three seconds or more) loss of consciousness (comparable to general anesthesia, when the recipient emerges and has lost memory of the event).
* a "flash" knockout, when a very transient (less than three seconds) loss of consciousness occurs (in the context of a knock-down) and the recipient often maintains awareness and memory of the combat.
* a "stunning", a "dazing" or a fighter being "KO'ed on his feet", when basic consciousness is maintained (and the fighter never leaves his feet) despite a general loss of [[awareness]] and extreme distortions in [[proprioception]], balance, visual fields, and auditory processing. Referees are taught specifically to watch for this state, as it cannot be improved by sheer willpower and usually means the fighter is already [[concussion|concussed]] and unable to safely defend himself.

A basic principle of boxing and other combat sports is to defend against this vulnerability by keeping both hands raised about the face and the chin tucked in. This may still be ineffective if the opponent punches effectively to the [[Celiac_plexus|solar plexus]].

A fighter who becomes unconscious from a [[strike (attack)|strike]] with sufficient [[knockout power]] is referred to as having been ''knocked out'' or ''KO'd'' (''kay-ohd''). Losing balance without losing consciousness is referred to as being ''knocked down'' ("down but not out"). Repeated blows to the head, regardless whether they cause loss of consciousness, are known to gradually cause permanent [[brain damage]]. In severe cases this may cause [[stroke]]s or [[paralysis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mmafighting.com/2017/9/8/16279100/boxer-gets-record-22-million-settlement-from-new-york-in-brain-injury-case|title=Boxer gets record $22 million settlement from New York in brain injury case|website=mmafighting.com|date=8 September 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918064225/https://www.mmafighting.com/2017/9/8/16279100/boxer-gets-record-22-million-settlement-from-new-york-in-brain-injury-case|archive-date=2017-09-18}}</ref> This loss of consciousness is commonly known as becoming "[[Chronic traumatic encephalopathy|punch drunk]]" or "shot". Because of this, many physicians advise against sports involving knockouts.<ref>{{citation |last1=Lieberman |first1=Abraham |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515025923/http://www.liebermanparkinsonclinic.com/content/view/48/31/ |archive-date=15 May 2006 |title=Causing Parkinson: Boxing, Brain Injury |date=1 April 2005 |access-date=24 June 2010 |url=http://www.liebermanparkinsonclinic.com/content/view/48/31/}}</ref>

==Knockdown==
[[File:Box24-knock-down.jpg|thumb|right|275px|A boxer has been knocked out and is being inspected by a ring doctor.]]
A '''knockdown''' occurs when a fighter touches the floor of the ring with any part of the body other than the feet following a hit, but is able to rise back up and continue fighting. The term is also used if the fighter is hanging on to the ropes, caught between the ropes, or is hanging over the ropes and is unable to fall to the floor and cannot protect himself. A knockdown triggers [[Mandatory eight count|a count]] by the referee (normally to 10); if the fighter fails the count, then the fight is ended as a KO.<ref name="Boxing Terminology">[http://www.ringsidebygus.com/boxing-terms.html#k Boxing Terminology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625131941/http://www.ringsidebygus.com/boxing-terms.html |date=2012-06-25 }} ''Ringside by Gus''.

A '''flash knockdown''' is a knockdown in which the fighter hits the canvas but recovers quickly enough that a count is not started.<ref name="Boxing Terminology"/>
