[[File:Heritage Singers Black Logo.png|thumb|Early Logo of Heritage Singers, 1971|261x261px]]'''Heritage Singers''' are an American gospel group founded by Max Mace and his wife Lucy, with their two children Valerie Ann and Gregory James.

==History==

After four years of performing with the Rose City Singers, a patriotic/folk singing group sponsored by [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]-based United Medical Laboratories, the Maces decided to resign and form a Christian group in 1971.<ref>{{cite book |author=Mace, Max and Lucy Mace with Joanne Velting Mullin |title=Beyond Our Dreams: The Heritage Singers Story |year=2010 |publisher=Color Press, Inc. |location=Walla Walla, WA |isbn=978-0-615-37223-5}} Pp. 4-5.</ref>  Jerry Leiske named the group based on Bible scripture equating saints with God's "heritage ... objects of His special care."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://liveitloudmagazine.com/uCaN%20Magazine/LLM%20Nov-Dec%202015/index.html |title=HS article by Linda O'Dell in Live It Loud Magazine, Nov/Dec 2015, p. 24 |access-date=November 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117022202/http://liveitloudmagazine.com/uCaN%20Magazine/LLM%20Nov-Dec%202015/index.html |archive-date=November 17, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The first year, they released two albums (''Hymns We Remember'' and ''Come Along with the Heritage Singers''), and performed their first public concert on June 4, 1971.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Heritage Singers Songbook - Favorites by Bill and Gloria Gaither|year= 1977|publisher= Alexandria House|location= Alexandria, Indiana|page=6}}</ref> Early accompanists included Bob Silverman on piano and Pete McLeod and Jeff Wood on guitars.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Heritage Singers Songbook - Favorites by Bill and Gloria Gaither|year= 1977|publisher= Alexandria House|location= Alexandria, Indiana|page=20}}</ref> In 1974 the Heritage Singers collaborated with Ron Huff, who arranged their first albums with full orchestration.<ref name="TheHeritage1977">{{cite book |title= The Heritage Singers Songbook - Favorites by Bill and Gloria Gaither|year= 1977|publisher= Alexandria House|location= Alexandria, Indiana|page=24}}</ref>

Heritage Singers bought a touring bus (a former Greyhound [[PD-4501 Scenicruiser]] they named "Old Blue") from a lot in San Francisco, which remained in their service for 10 years.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll8D7BQFkf8&t=1835s]

As their popularity grew (along with the television series "Heritage Singers Presents"), they formed a second group in September 1974, dubbed Heritage II,<ref>{{cite book |title= The Heritage Singers Songbook - Favorites by Bill and Gloria Gaither|year= 1977|publisher= Alexandria House|location= Alexandria, Indiana|page=30}}</ref> (subsequently named New Creation)<ref>{{cite book |title= The Heritage Singers Songbook - Favorites by Bill and Gloria Gaither|year= 1977|publisher= Alexandria House|location= Alexandria, Indiana|page=48}}</ref> to perform mostly at cities located in the eastern half of the United States;<ref>Mace et al., ''ibid''., p. 23</ref>, and a third group, Heritage Singers en Español, which tours South America singing Spanish versions of the group's signature songs.<ref>Mace et al., ''ibid''., p. 101</ref> More than 250 people have performed as members of The Heritage Singers; however, the Mace family has remained at its core. As for the religious affiliation of its members, Max Mace has stated that while a majority of them are [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]], that's not in itself a requirement. "They have to be a [[Born again|born-again]] Christian and receptive to the Adventist message."<ref name="THP2013" />

In the mid-1980's, the group televised a program called "Keep on Singing" and was aired on [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]]. It was uploaded on YouTube some time later and was called "Heritage Singers Classics". Around the same time this program was aired, Heritage Singers began performing for [[Loma Linda University Church]] and have done so ever since. Recently, since the COVID-19 Pandemic, they have not been invited back as a whole group, but individual members have been invited to sing at various services of theirs (mostly Tim Calhoun). Max Mace’s nephew, Doug Mace, is also Director of Middle School Ministries there.

In 1985, the group collaborated with Art Mapa, a sound producer, arranger, guitarist, and composer, and eventually married Val Mace (-Mapa). Soon after, Turning Point Studio was created, where Heritage Singers albums were recorded thereafter.

==Reunions==

Celebratory reunion concerts have been held in 1979 ([[Swing Auditorium]]), 1986 ([[Anaheim Convention Center]]), 2001 ([[Ontario, California|Ontario]] Convention Center), and 2005 ([[Crystal Cathedral]]).<ref>Mace et al., ''ibid''., pp. 151, 155</ref> A final 45th anniversary reunion was held at the [[Citizens Business Bank Arena]] on July 30, 2016 with 126 singers on stage.<ref name="pe809065">{{cite news |url=http://www.pe.com/articles/mace-809065-singers-group.html |title=ONTARIO: Heritage Singers stage a final reunion show |publisher=The Press-Enterprise |date=July 25, 2016 |author=Woods II, Wes}}</ref><ref name="dvdcredits">Names of 126 singers are listed in the closing credits of the DVD published in November 2016 (catalog no. DVDHR2016).</ref>

==Death of founder, Max Mace==

Following a bout with cancer, Max Mace died at his home in Placerville, California on November 4, 2020, one day shy of his 83rd birthday.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nadadventist.org/news/max-mace-82-adventist-music-legend-passes-his-rest|title=Max Mace, 82, Adventist Music Legend, Passes to His Rest &#124; North American Division of Seventh-day Adventists|website=www.nadadventist.org|accessdate=July 13, 2021}}</ref> At his memorial service held by the Loma Linda University Church, Max’s daughter, Val Mace-Mapa, and her family have vowed to continue the forward-thinking path that Max and Lucy began.
