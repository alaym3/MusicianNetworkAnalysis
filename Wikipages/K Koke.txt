'''Kevin Georgiou''' (born 22 May 1985), known professionally as '''K Koke''', is a British rapper from [[Stonebridge, London|Stonebridge]], North-West [[London]]. He is best known for his "Are You Alone" Diss track and ''Fire in the Booth'' freestyle on [[Charlie Sloth]]'s show on [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]], which has accumulated over 20 million [[YouTube]] views.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqgtYHlKhqA |title=K Koke - Fire in the Booth Part 1 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2010-05-18 |access-date=2020-05-21}}</ref><ref name="noisey">{{cite web|url = https://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/article/which-mc-recorded-the-best-ever-fire-in-the-booth | first = Paul | last = Gibbins | date = 1 March 2016 | access-date = 22 October 2016 | work = Noisey | publisher = [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] | title = Which MC Recorded the Greatest 'Fire in the Booth'?}}</ref>

==Music career==
His first mixtape, ''Pure Koke Volume One'', was given away for free on various online outlets. Following extensive radio play, he signed a deal with [[Roc Nation]].<ref>[http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.13714/title.jay-z-inks-a-deal-with-uk-rapper-k-koke/ Jay-Z Inks a Deal With UK Rapper K Koke] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110122211839/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.13714/title.jay-z-inks-a-deal-with-uk-rapper-k-koke |date=22 January 2011 }}. www.hiphopdx.com.</ref><ref>[http://www.rttnews.com/ArticleView.aspx?Id=1529436 Jay-Z Adds Britain's K Koke To Roc Nation].

At the time of signing to Roc Nation, Georgiou was preparing to release ''Pure Koke Volume Two''. He released visuals for singles "Nobody But Us" feat Abel Miller, "Lord Knows" feat Don Jaga and "Streets Are Cold" which features Birmingham's UK rap veteran Malik MD7. However, his music career was stopped abruptly as he was arrested for attempted murder. This meant ''Pure Koke: Volume 2'' was released with very little promotion due to his disappearance.

Georgiou was later dropped from Roc Nation and in 2015 signed with [[Universal Music]].

==Attempted murder trial==
Georgiou was charged with the attempted murder of an unidentified 27-year-old football player at [[Harlesden station]] on 9 March 2011 along with associate named Levi who was [[remanded]] in custody pending trial in October 2011.<ref name="kt1">{{cite web|url=http://www.kilburntimes.co.uk/news/stonebridge_rapper_k_koke_charged_with_harlesden_shooting_1_857558|work=Kilburn Times|title=Stonebridge rapper K Koke charged with Harlesden shooting|date=7 April 2011|access-date=2011-08-13}}</ref><ref name="kt2">{{cite web|url=http://www.kilburntimes.co.uk/news/stonebridge_rapper_k_koke_to_stand_trial_for_attempted_murder_in_october_1_876082|work=Kilburn Times|title=Stonebridge rapper K Koke to stand trial for attempted murder in October|access-date=2011-08-14|date=26 April 2011}}</ref> The victim was shot in the back.<ref name="kt1" /> Georgiou stood trial on 4 October 2011 and was acquitted of all charges on 3 November 2011 after seven months on remand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.london24.com/news/crime/stonebridge_rapper_k_koke_acquitted_of_harlesden_train_station_shooting_1_1116524 |title=Archived copy |access-date=3 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023061954/http://www.london24.com/news/crime/stonebridge_rapper_k_koke_acquitted_of_harlesden_train_station_shooting_1_1116524 |archive-date=23 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
