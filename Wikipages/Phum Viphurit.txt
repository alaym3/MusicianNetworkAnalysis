==Biography==
Viphurit was born in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]. His father is an architect, while his mother is a graphic designer. Viphurit moved to [[Hamilton, New Zealand]] when he was 9. While in New Zealand, he got his first instrument; a [[drum]] which he had desired to have since he was little. However, Viphurit was forced to stop playing the drums and turned to [[guitar]] since the drum sound was said to be disturbing the neighbours.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mgronline.com/onlinesection/detail/9610000061280|title=หนุ่มอินดี้ที่กำลังดังไปทั่วโลก...แห่งเสียงเพลง "ภูมิ วิภูริศ"|date=2018-07-04|newspaper=ผู้จัดการออนไลน์|lang=th|access-date=2018-09-27}}</ref>  Viphurit moved back to Thailand when he was 18 to study at [[Mahidol University International College]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.judprakai.com/entertainment/672|title=ภูมิ วิภูริศ : ทุกคนเท่าเทียมกันบนยูทูป|last=สาลีโภชน์|first=ทัศนีย์|date=2018-09-12|lang=th|newspaper=กรุงเทพธุรกิจ|access-date=2018-09-27}}</ref>

In Thailand, Viphurit became known on from his original and cover songs on YouTube, and signed to indie label Rats Records. He released his debut album ''Manchild'' in 2017.
