He grew up in [[Tortola]] in the [[Virgin Islands]].<ref name="Reuters091106" /> Iyaz studied [[digital recording]] at [[New England Institute of Technology]].<ref>David Caplan, [http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20341342,00.html "5 Things to Know About Singer Iyaz"], ''People'', 2 April 2010</ref> He was featured on the track "Island Girls" by Out Da Box Family, which achieved radio success in the [[Caribbean]].<ref name="Reuters091106" /> [[Sean Kingston]] found Iyaz through his [[Myspace]] page in 2008<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigtop40.com/artists/h-j/iyaz/replay/ |title=Artists &#124; Replay – Big Top 40 Music moms |publisher=Bigtop40.com |access-date=9 August 2010}}</ref> and later signed him to a [[recording contract]] with Time Is Money/Beluga Heights. Michael Nguyen introduced him to producer and Beluga Heights head [[J.R. Rotem]]. He released "Replay" in 2009, which peaked at number 2 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and at number 1 in several territories, including the United Kingdom.<ref name="Reuters091106">{{cite web|last=Lipshutz|first=Jason|title=Young island-pop singer Iyaz hits "Replay"|work=Billboard|publisher=Reuters|date=6 November 2009|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/musicNews/idUSTRE5A601820091107|access-date=20 November 2009}}</ref> His second single "Solo" was released in February 2010, and peaked at number 32 on the Hot 100.

In an interview with [[HitQuarters]], Rotem described Iyaz's creative perfectionism:

<blockquote>
"Where as [''[[sic]]''] others might work on several songs in one day, he might sit there and work on one song for days. The end result that he gets is usually an absolute gem, so heartfelt and genuine."<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_JR_Rotem_Interview.html |title=Interview With JR Rotem |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=4 April 2010 |access-date=8 April 2010 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67WG6IGNh?url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_JR_Rotem_Interview.html |archive-date=9 May 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 2011, Iyaz played his part in [[Big Time Rush]]'s song "If I Ruled the World". Iyaz released "Last Forever" with [[David Guetta]] as the producer,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/iyaz-last-forever-prod-by-david-guetta-song.313693.html|title=IYAZ - Last Forever (Prod. By David Guetta)|website=HotNewHipHop}}</ref> and its follow-up, "At Last". Iyaz was featured on [[New Boyz]]'s single "Break My Bank" and [[Akon]]'s "My Girl".

Later, Iyaz did a duet called "[[You're My Only Shorty]]" with [[Demi Lovato]], which is from Lovato's third studio album, ''[[Unbroken (Demi Lovato album)|Unbroken]]''. He released a song with [[Travie McCoy]] titled "[[Pretty Girls (Iyaz song)|Pretty Girls]]" and later in the year a song titled "My Heart Broke" surfaced. Iyaz uploaded a duet song named, "Christmas Time" featuring Sha Sha Jones on to [[YouTube]], A Christmas song which His Grandparents requested.

In 2013, a slew of tracks credited to Iyaz surfaced online, namely "Da Da Da", along with "Congrats", "What Is This Feeling" and "Too Sexy".

In 2014, after leaving his previous labels the year prior, Iyaz signed with new Los Angeles-based independent record label Rekless Music, which is distributed by the [[Alternative Distribution Alliance]] and [[Warner Music Group]]. Iyaz made a cover of [[Chris Brown]]'s "[[Loyal (Chris Brown song)|Loyal]]" named "Comin' for Ya", followed by another cover months after of [[Magic!]]'s song "[[Rude (song)|Rude]]" which he shared on SoundCloud. Iyaz tweeted in December 2014 he would release a single titled "One Million", and released a snippet of the song on SoundCloud. Iyaz released "One Million" on [[iTunes]] in Japan on 12 December 2014, the first single from his second album ''Aurora'', released exclusively in Japan on 8 April 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.apple.com/jp/album/aurora-bonus-track-version/975814324|title=Iyazの「Aurora (Bonus Track Version)」|via=music.apple.com}}</ref>

On 24 July 2015 Iyaz released the second single from ''Aurora'', "Alive", featuring [[Nash Overstreet]] of [[Hot Chelle Rae]]. It was produced by J.D.
