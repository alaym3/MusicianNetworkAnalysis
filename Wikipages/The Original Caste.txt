'''The Original Caste''' is a Canadian [[folk music|folk]] group. The band formed in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, in 1966 under the name The North Country Singers.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p168465|pure_url=yes}} Biography], Allmusic.com</ref>  Because the name sounded too much like a folk group, it was changed in 1968. Instrumentally, the group consists of guitar, keyboard and bass.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theoriginalcaste.com |title=Bruce Innes |publisher=Theoriginalcaste.com |accessdate=2014-02-06}}</ref>

==History==
Songwriter and guitarist Bruce Innes formed the group in Calgary, Alberta, in 1966.  Initially, Bruce Innes, Graham Bruce and Bliss Mackie worked as a trio and Dixie Lee (Stone) Innes joined the group in 1967, contributing rich vocals. At that time, Dixie Lee Stone was a secretary at Pacific Petroleum in Calgary, and she sang on the weekly television programme ''[[Calgary Safety Roundup]]'' on CFCN-TV. Bruce Innes sang and played by himself while Graham Bruce worked as an accounts executive at Royal Trust. Bliss Mackie had worked as a Coca-Cola truck driver and a manager of a department store. In early 1968 Peter Brown (Seattle) became the first drummer in the group. Joe Cavender played with an acid rock group.

In 1968, the band moved to Los Angeles and recorded the single "I Can’t Make It Anymore" for [[Dot Records]] with limited success.  In 1969, the band signed with [[Talent Associates|TA Records]], a label distributed by [[Bell Records]]. The band did write many of their pieces but the writing and production team of [[Dennis Lambert]] and [[Brian Potter (musician)|Brian Potter]] wrote and produced The Original Caste's two hit singles: "One Tin Soldier" and then "Mr. Monday"; both songs were from the 1969 LP ''The Original Caste''. The songs employ the use of strings, horns, and organ which adds a swinging, pop-friendly sound.  "One Tin Soldier" was a hit in Canada and reached No.&nbsp;34 on the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]] in 1970.<ref>Joel Whitburn, ''The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits''. 7th edn, 2000</ref> The follow-up single, "Mr. Monday", was a big hit in [[Japan]] and Canada but not in the United States. The two singles combined, worldwide, sold over three million copies and were certified gold in both Canada and Japan. The band toured extensively in Canada, the United States and Japan and made many television appearances. The band's success allowed them the opportunity to open for both [[B. B. King]] and [[Glen Campbell]]. Having amassed a large following in Japan, they toured there and recorded [[live album]]s, in addition to releasing several further Japanese singles.

The initial members of The Original Caste separated in 1972 with Graham Bruce and Bliss Mackie parting. Married couple Bruce and Dixie Innes continued to perform as The Original Caste and released songs with an increased country influence, including the full-length album ''Back Home''. The Original Caste finally split in 1980 as Bruce and Dixie divorced. Innes continues to perform as a solo artist and later revived the band name in the new millennium.

"[[One Tin Soldier]]" was revived in 1971 when the song was featured on the ''[[Billy Jack]]'' movie soundtrack; this version was performed by Jinx Dawson of the rock band [[Coven (band)|Coven]] along with the studio's orchestra. This recording was released to radio, then retracted; Coven later released a version on an album. Both versions billed as being by Coven were based on substantially the original arrangement, though some cover versions diverged widely. The popularity of the song has endured as very diverse covers have been recorded by punk rock group Me First and the Gimme Gimmes and by Sonny and Cher; Roseanne Barr also recorded a parody of the song.

A [[strophic]] ballad, "One Tin Soldier" tells the tale of the materialistic "valley-people" who kill and cheat in search of a rumoured treasure on a mountain. The only treasure, though, is a stone inscribed with "Peace on earth"; ironically, the valley-people, a metaphor for mankind, destroyed this treasure whilst in the pursuit of it. The song ends with a repetition of the chorus which is a common arrangement technique used to engrain a song in the listener's memory.
