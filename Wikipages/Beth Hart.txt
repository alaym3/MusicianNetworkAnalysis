'''Beth Hart''' (born January 24, 1972) is an American singer, songwriter and musician from [[Los Angeles, California]]. She rose to fame with the release of her 1999 single {{nowrap|"[[LA Song (Out of This Town)]]"}} from her second album ''[[Screamin' for My Supper]]''. The single was a number one hit in New Zealand, as well as reaching the top 5 of the US [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] and Top 10 on the ''Billboard'' [[Adult Top 40]] charts.

The albums ''[[Seesaw (album)|Seesaw]]'' and ''[[Live in Amsterdam (Beth Hart and Joe Bonamassa album)|Live in Amsterdam]]'' by Hart and [[Joe Bonamassa]] debuted at number 1 on the Billboard Blues Album Chart, a chart she has now topped six times. Hart has had two number 1 singles in Denmark, "As Good as It Gets" and "Learning to Live", as well a double platinum-selling album, ''[[Leave the Light On (Beth Hart album)|Leave the Light On]]''.

Hart's first album with Bonamassa, ''Don't Explain'', went gold in the Netherlands, while their 2014 collaboration ''[[Seesaw (album)|Seesaw]]'' was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]], and gave Hart her first [[Blues Music Award]] nomination in the category 'Best Contemporary Blues Female Artist'.

==Early life==
Hart was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. As a 4-year-old, she began to play piano. At first, she concentrated on classical works by [[Bach]] and [[Beethoven]], but as she grew older, she also began to play pieces by artists such as [[Etta James]], [[Otis Redding]] and [[Led Zeppelin]].<ref name="Chichester">{{cite web|url=http://www.chichester.co.uk/whats-on/music/beth-hart-brings-raw-and-powerful-blues-rock-sound-to-the-brook-in-southampton-1-3200792|work=Chichester Observer|title=Beth Hart brings raw and powerful blues-rock sound to The Brook in Southampton|date=October 31, 2011|access-date=August 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810105204/https://www.chichester.co.uk/whats-on/music/beth-hart-brings-raw-and-powerful-blues-rock-sound-to-the-brook-in-southampton-1-3200792|archive-date=August 10, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Regarding her childhood in an interview with Don Wilcock, Hart stated, "When I was a kid, my dad left me in a bad way, and what fucked me up the most was that he would be in the lives of my other sisters and brothers, but he wouldn't be in mine." At the age of 20, Hart lost her sister from complications of [[AIDS]].<ref name="BluesBlast">{{cite news |last1=Wilcock |first1=Don |title=Featured Interview – Beth Hart |url=http://www.bluesblastmagazine.com/featured-interview-beth-hart/ |access-date=August 9, 2018 |date=March 4, 2016}}</ref>

==Career==
===1987–1998: Career beginnings===
Hart entered Los Angeles' [[Los Angeles County High School for the Arts|High School for the Performing Arts]] in 10th grade as a vocal and cello major. At the prompting of a classmate, she soon began singing during open mic nights in the Belly Room of the Comedy Store.<ref>{{cite web |title=Beth Hart Biography |url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwclassical/classical/Beth-Hart/bio |website=Broadway World |publisher=Wisdom Digital Media |access-date=August 8, 2018}}</ref>

Hart began playing clubs in Hollywood at the age of 15, and eventually enlisted bassist Tal Herzberg and guitarist Jimmy Khoury for ''Beth Hart and the Ocean of Souls'', which was recorded in 1993. It includes "Am I the One" (which later appeared on her first official record "Immortal") and a pop-rock cover of the Beatles' "[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]". The first released album with the Beth Hart Band,<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p175043|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography: Beth Hart |website=AllMusic |access-date=April 26, 2010 |author=Ankeny, Jason}}</ref> ''[[Immortal (Beth Hart album)|Immortal]]'', was released in 1996 through Atlantic, scanning 13,000 copies<ref>{{cite book |title=Billboard |date=July 3, 1999 |publisher=Billboard Magazine |page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_jAgEAAAAMBAJ/page/n14 15] |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_jAgEAAAAMBAJ |access-date=August 9, 2018}}</ref> and featured the single "God Bless You".

In 1993, Hart appeared on [[Ed McMahon]]'s ''[[Star Search]]'', ultimately winning the Female Vocalist competition. Hart has stated that winning the show did not land her a record deal due to the stigma associated with performing on the show, and that she had burned through the prize money she received by the time she struck a deal with [[Atlantic Records]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Greenblatt |first1=Mike |title=For Beth Hart, success is sweeter the second time around |url=http://www.goldminemag.com/articles/for-beth-hart-is-better-the-second-time-around |access-date=August 9, 2018 |publisher=F+W Media |date=September 26, 2013}}</ref>

Hart's follow-up album, ''[[Leave the Light On (Beth Hart album)|Leave the Light On]]'', was released in 2003 via Koch Records, after being dropped by Atlantic presumably due to Hart's drug addiction.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Houk |first1=Steve |title=Beth Hart: Surviving to Sing |url=https://www.bethhart.com/beth-hart-surviving-to-sing/ |publisher=Mid Life Rocker |access-date=August 9, 2018 |quote="They said, you know what, buh bye, you're outta here, we're letting you go, you're gonna die and we're not gonna stand by.
