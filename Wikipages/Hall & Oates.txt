'''Daryl Hall and John Oates''' are an American [[pop rock]] duo formed in [[Philadelphia]] in 1970. [[Daryl Hall]] is generally the lead vocalist; [[John Oates]] primarily plays electric guitar and provides backing vocals. The two write most of the songs they perform, separately or in collaboration. They achieved their greatest fame from the mid-1970s to the late-1980s with a fusion of [[rock and roll]] and [[rhythm and blues]].<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4427|pure_url=yes}}|title=Hall & Oates|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=September 13, 2011}}</ref>

Credited as '''Daryl Hall & John Oates''' (or '''Daryl Hall John Oates''') on all of their US releases, the duo reached the US Top 40 with 29 of their 33 singles charting on [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] between 1974 and 1991. Six of these peaked at number one: "[[Rich Girl (Hall & Oates song)|Rich Girl]]" (1977), "[[Kiss on My List]]" (1980), the two 1981 releases "[[Private Eyes (song)|Private Eyes]]", and "[[I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)]]" (also a [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Soul]] No. 1), "[[Maneater (Hall & Oates song)|Maneater]]" (1982) and "[[Out of Touch (song)|Out of Touch]]" (1984). Their overall 16 US Top Tens also include "[[She's Gone (Hall & Oates song)|She's Gone]]", "[[Sara Smile]]", "[[You Make My Dreams]]", "[[Family Man (Hall & Oates song)|Family Man]]", "[[Say It Isn't So (Hall & Oates song)|Say It Isn't So]]", and "[[Method of Modern Love]]". Seven of their albums have been [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]-certified [[platinum]] and six of them gold.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Hall%20Oates&sort=Artist&perPage=50|title=Hall & Oats RIAA certifications|website=[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]|access-date=March 14, 2016}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, they have achieved success with two Top Ten albums and six Top 40 singles, two of which – "I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)" and "Maneater" – reached the Top Ten. The duo have spent 120 weeks in the UK Top 75 albums chart and 84 weeks in the UK Top 75 [[UK Singles Chart|singles chart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/15916/hall-and-oates/|title=Hall and Oates|website=[[Official Charts Company]]|language=en|access-date=July 2, 2017}}</ref>

While employing a wide variety of session musicians on their recordings, they did have a long working relationship with several musicians who appeared on many of their works and have toured with them. They include guitarist [[G.E. Smith]], bassist [[Tom Wolk|Tom "T-Bone" Wolk]], and multi-instrumentalist [[Charles DeChant]]. In addition, they collaborated with sisters [[Sara Allen]] and [[Janna Allen]] on songwriting and composing.

In 2003, Hall & Oates were inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]]. In August 2018, in a 60th-anniversary celebration of ''Billboard'''s Hot 100, the duo ranked 18 in a list of the top Hot 100 artists of all time and six in a list of the Hot 100's top duos/groups. They remain the most successful duo of all time, ahead of [[the Carpenters]], [[the Everly Brothers]], and [[Simon & Garfunkel]].<ref>{{cite news|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=daryl hall & john oates|bio=true}}|title=Daryl Hall & John Oates Biography & Awards|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard magazine]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|access-date=November 2, 2012}}</ref> In September 2010, [[VH1]] placed the duo at no.&nbsp;99 in their list of the 100 greatest artists of all time.

== Name ==
The duo never liked to be referred to as "Hall & Oates". In an interview with ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', Oates said, "There isn't one album that says ''Hall and Oates''. It's always '''''Daryl Hall and John Oates''''', from the very beginning. People never note that. The idea of 'Hall and Oates', this two-headed monster, this thing, is not anything we've ever wanted or liked."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/what-ive-learned/meaning-of-life-2012/john-oates-quotes-0112|title=John Oates: What I've Learned|magazine=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|date=January 9, 2012|last=McCammon|first=Ross|access-date=January 5, 2021}}</ref> In a 2015 interview, Oates noted that "it's a horrible name" and that "it was a totally conscious decision" not to be known as "Hall & Oates". "We didn't want to be the [[Everly Brothers]], or [[Loggins & Messina]], or whatever."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://vanyaland.com/2015/04/14/interview-john-oates-on-a-hall-of-fame-career-protecting-his-name-and-hall-oates-having-the-worst-name-in-rock-and-roll-history/2/|title=Interview: John Oates on a Hall of Fame career, protecting his brand, and Hall & Oates having 'the worst name in rock and roll history'|date=April 14, 2015|last=Marotta|first=Michael|work=Vanyaland|access-date=January 5, 2021|quote=It was a totally conscious decision. Daryl made a joke about it when first got together. He said "I hate being called by my last name, it reminds me of gym class: 'Hey Hall.'" So we said, we are two individuals working together, because we actually started that way — when we first started playing together we hadn't written any songs together. I had written a bunch of songs and he had written a bunch of songs and he said "Look, you play your songs and I'll play behind you," and Daryl would play his songs and I'll play guitar. And that was our working relationship — two guys, two songwriters working with each other. And we didn't even sing together and we actually still don't sing together very often, it's just never been something we ever wanted to do. We didn't want to be the Everly Brothers, or Loggins & Messina, or whatever.}}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[The Mercury News]]'', Hall explained that "the reason we've always insisted on our full names is because we consider ourselves to be two individual artists. We're not really a classic duo in that respect."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/09/12/daryl-hall-thats-the-expletive-stupidest-thing-ive-ever-heard/|title=Daryl Hall: 'That's the (expletive) stupidest thing I've ever heard'|newspaper=[[The Mercury News]]|date=September 12, 2017|last=Harrington|first=Jim|access-date=January 5, 2021}}</ref>

The duo are credited as '''Daryl Hall  John Oates''' with no "and" or ampersand on many of their releases.<ref>{{Discogs artist|95886-Daryl-Hall-John-Oates}}</ref>

Despite their stated dislike for the name "Hall & Oates", the group sued a Brooklyn-based granola company in 2015 for naming one of their products "Haulin' Oats", claiming it was a "well-known mark" of the group.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/hall-and-oates-suing-granola-company-over-haulin-oats-50245/|title=Rolling Stone: Hall and Oates Suing Granola Company Over 'Haulin' Oats'|access-date= January 16, 2021}}</ref>

At the time they met, each was heading his own musical group, Hall with The Temptones and Oates with The Masters. They were there for a band competition when gunfire rang out between two rival gangs, and in trying to escape, they ran to the same service elevator. On further discovering that they were interested in the same music and that both were attending Philadelphia's [[Temple University]], they started spending time together on a regular basis and eventually shared a number of apartments in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/304/hall_or_nothing/|title=Daryl Hall: Interview from Daryl's House|first=Pete|last=Lewis|work=Bluesandsoul.com|access-date=April 13, 2001}}</ref> One of the apartments they shared had "Hall & Oates" on the mailbox, which became the duo's common nickname.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/daryl-hall-and-john-oates,34957/|title=Interview: Daryl Hall and John Oates|newspaper=[[The A.V.

=== 1972–1974: First albums ===
Early in their recording careers, Hall and Oates had trouble clearly defining their sound, alternating among [[Folk music|folk]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music|pop]]. None of their early albums—''[[Whole Oats]]'', ''[[Abandoned Luncheonette]]'' and ''[[War Babies (Hall & Oates album)|War Babies]]''—was very successful.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Despite being produced by such big-name producers as [[Arif Mardin]] and [[Todd Rundgren]], they had no hit singles during this time period, though ''[[Abandoned Luncheonette]]'' contained "[[She's Gone (Hall & Oates song)|She's Gone]]".<ref name="LarkinSM"/> This song was covered by [[Lou Rawls]] and [[Tavares (group)|Tavares]] before [[Atlantic Records]] re-released the Hall and Oates version in 1976. "She's Gone", as covered by Tavares, did go to Number One on the R&B chart in 1974.{{cn|date=February 2021}} It was originally written for Hall's first wife, Bryna Lublin (Hall), and initially inspired by Oates's being stood up on a date on New Year's Eve. Another ''Abandoned Luncheonette'' single, "Las Vegas Turnaround", was written about (and mentioned by first name) Hall's girlfriend, flight attendant and future song-writing collaborator [[Sara Allen]].{{cn|date=February 2021}} Despite the fact that none of the Atlantic albums was a huge national hit, in [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul|Minneapolis–St. Paul]], a number of tracks on ''Abandoned Luncheonette'' received significant airplay on local FM station [[KQRS-FM|KQRS]], making it a local hit.{{cn|date=February 2021}} The regional successes the album achieved were enough to push the album onto the chart, reaching #33 on November 20, 1976, and staying on the chart for 38 weeks.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/daryl-hall-john-oates/chart-history/tlp/|title=Abandoned Luncheonette|magazine=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|access-date=December 4, 2017}}</ref>

=== 1975–1977: First hits ===
[[File:WMMS Presents Hall & Oates - 1976 print ad.jpg|thumb|220px|Print ad for Belkin Productions, Cleveland Public Hall, [[WMMS]] Radio in ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' newspaper on December 5, 1976]]
Hall and Oates left [[Atlantic Records]] after the release of ''War Babies'' to join [[RCA Records]].<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Their first album for the new label, ''[[Daryl Hall & John Oates (album)|Daryl Hall & John Oates]]'' (often referred to by their fans as ''the silver album'' because of the silver foil material on the original album cover), was their first notable success. It contained the ballad "[[Sara Smile]]",<ref name="LarkinSM"/> a song Hall wrote for his aforementioned girlfriend Sara Allen.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Graff |first1=Gary |title=Daryl Hall finds fulfillment going solo |url=http://www2.readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=352442 |access-date=June 26, 2021 |agency=New York Times Syndicate |publisher=Reading Eagle |date=December 13, 2011}}</ref> It also featured an album cover in which Hall and Oates are overly made up with [[Blush (cosmetics)|cosmetic blush]] to the point where they looked like women, especially the long-haired and clean-shaven Hall. Hall later said in an interview for [[VH1]]'s ''[[Behind the Music]]'' that he looked like "the girl I always wanted to go out with" on that album cover. This cover was made by Pierre LaRoche, who created [[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]] for [[David Bowie]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/david-bowie-pierre-laroche/|title=The Man Behind David Bowie's Look: Pierre LaRoche|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|access-date=March 29, 2016}}</ref>

"Sara Smile" became their first Top 10 hit, reaching No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 [[Billboard Hot 100|chart]] in June 1976. "She's Gone", re-released by [[Atlantic Records]] after "Sara Smile", also went to the Top 10, reaching No. 7 in October 1976. Hall and Oates followed those hits with the more pop-oriented album ''[[Bigger Than Both of Us]]'' later that year. Though the album's first single—the Philadelphia soul-oriented ballad "Do What You Want, Be What You Are"—barely made the Top 40, their second single, "[[Rich Girl (Hall & Oates song)|Rich Girl]]", was a smash.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> The song was Hall and Oates's first No. 1 hit,<ref name="LarkinSM"/> reaching the top spot for the week ending March 26, 1977.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/daryl-hall-john-oates/chart-history/hsi/|title=Daryl Hall John Oates Chart History|magazine=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|access-date=February 2, 2018}}</ref>

=== 1977–1978: Leaner years and ''Sacred Songs'' ===
After this small run of hits, Hall and Oates still encountered difficulty getting radio play. Despite touring constantly and recording albums with efficiency, the duo could not find any pop success for a number of reasons, mainly because of the popularity of the disco genre. By the time they released the rock-oriented albums ''[[Beauty on a Back Street]]'' in 1977 and ''[[Along the Red Ledge]]'' in 1978, disco music was trendy and taking most of the spots in popular music. 

They did release a few hit singles during this period: the follow-up to "Rich Girl" ("Back Together Again") hit the Top 40, and "It's A Laugh" (from "Along The Red Ledge") hit the top 20 in 1978. In 1977, RCA attempted to push Hall to the fore with his first solo effort ''[[Sacred Songs]]''. However, after being presented with the highly experimental recording (produced by [[Robert Fripp]] of [[King Crimson]]), RCA became unwilling to release what was, in their view, a non-commercial album. ''Sacred Songs'' was eventually released in 1980.{{cn|date=February 2021}}

=== 1979–1981: ''X-Static'' and ''Voices'' ===
The 1980s brought about significant changes for Hall and Oates. The pair felt that the biggest hindrance to their success was that their music was being filtered through outside producers, and that studio musicians were not familiar with their own tastes and thoughts. In 1979, they hired [[G. E. Smith]] (who had worked with [[Dan Hartman]] and [[David Bowie]] by then) as lead guitarist, [[Mickey Curry|Mikey Curry]] as drummer in 1980 and later in 1981 [[Tom "T-Bone" Wolk]] joined as bassist. They also enlisted Hall's girlfriend Sara Allen (and also her younger sister [[Janna Allen|Janna]]) as songwriting collaborators, as well as beginning a working relationship with [[Neil Kernon]], an engineer on ''Voices'' who worked as co-producer on their succeeding two albums.{{cn|date=February 2021}} In late 1979, Hall and Oates released ''[[X-Static]]'', which combined rock with [[disco]].<ref name="LarkinSM"/> The album did not fare well, although "[[Wait for Me (Hall & Oates song)|Wait for Me]]" did hit the top 20. 

The band also wished to capture the sound of [[New York City]] which, by then, had become their home.{{cn|date=February 2021}} As a result, instead of recording in [[Los Angeles]], as they had done previously, they decided to record at [[Electric Lady Studios]] in New York City, just five minutes away from their apartments, and began producing their own recordings with their touring band backing them in the studio. 

The resulting album, ''[[Voices (Hall & Oates album)|Voices]]'', was written, produced and arranged by Hall and Oates in one month, according to their authorized biography ''Dangerous Dances'' (by [[Nick Tosches]]). The first two singles from the album charted fairly well, with "[[How Does It Feel to Be Back]]" charting at Number 30. The well-received [[cover version|cover]] of [[The Righteous Brothers]]' "[[You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin']]",<ref name="LarkinSM"/> just missed the Top 10, peaking at Number 12, but spent 14 weeks in the Top 40. After the release of that song, Oates's contribution as the lead vocalist diminished on future releases. The third single "[[Kiss on My List]]" hit Number 1 in April 1981 and remained there for three weeks. The follow-up single "[[You Make My Dreams]]" reached Number 5 in July of that year.{{cn|date=February 2021}}

The other well-known song from ''Voices'' is the emotive ballad "[[Everytime You Go Away]]", with powerful lead vocals by Hall, who wrote it.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> British singer [[Paul Young (singer and guitarist)|Paul Young]] had a ''Billboard'' Number 1 hit with a cover of the song in 1985.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Though the Hall and Oates original (recorded in a Memphis-soul style) was never released as a single, it remains a fan favorite on the duo's greatest hits albums, and was featured on their [[Live at the Apollo (Hall & Oates album)|Apollo Theater album]] in 1985, and is frequently featured in their live set to this day.{{cn|date=February 2021}}

=== 1981–1982: ''Private Eyes'' ===
By the time "You Make My Dreams" was falling off the charts, Hall and Oates had already released their follow-up album ''[[Private Eyes (Hall & Oates album)|Private Eyes]]''. Having worked in the studio while ''Voices'' was at its peak in popularity, the two had already recorded most of their material and perfected a fusion of their doo-wop and soul roots with [[New wave music|New Wave]] energy and [[hard rock]] grit.<ref name="Hall and Oates-Private Eyes">{{cite web|title=Hall and Oates-Private Eyes|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com|access-date=October 3, 2014}}</ref> The result was a pop classic that is often considered one of the greatest albums of the 1980s,<ref name="Hall and Oates-Private Eyes"/> and was the first Hall and Oates album to reach the Top 10 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart, while four singles from ''Private Eyes'' all reached the Top 40.

The [[Private Eyes (song)|title track]] and "[[I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)]]" were nearly consecutive Number 1 hits, separated only by the ten-week stay at Number 1 by the monster hit "[[Physical (Olivia Newton-John song)|Physical]]" by [[Olivia Newton-John]]. "I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)" was one of the few songs ever recorded by a white act to reach Number One on both the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] and the pop charts. "[[Did It in a Minute]]" reached Number 9 in the spring of 1982, and "Your Imagination" peaked at No.&nbsp;33.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ECUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA36|title=Disco Top 60|magazine=Billboard|date=January 30, 1982|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=36|volume=94|issue=4|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> 

=== 1982–1983: ''H<sub>2</sub>O'' and band changes ===
Their next album, ''[[H2O (Hall & Oates album)|H<sub>2</sub>O]]'', a very polished, synth-heavy effort, became the duo's most successful album, with US sales eventually approaching four million copies. ''H<sub>2</sub>O'' reached No. 3 on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] (where it held for 15 weeks) and spawned three Top 10 singles. "[[Maneater (Hall & Oates song)|Maneater]]", the biggest hit of their career, reached No. 1 on December 18, 1982, and stayed there for four weeks.{{cn|date=February 2021}}

The soulful ballad "[[One on One (song)|One on One]]" and a cover of [[Mike Oldfield]]'s "[[Family Man (Mike Oldfield song)|Family Man]]" reached No. 7 and No. 6 in March and June 1983, respectively.

According to Oates, they recorded approximately twenty songs for the album, of which nine did not make the final cut. He went on to say they usually had five or six tracks left over per album.<ref name=juke>{{cite news|title=Hall & Oates: Water on the Brain|magazine=[[Juke Magazine]]|date=November 6, 1982|author=Allan Webster|page=20}}</ref>

For the ''H<sub>2</sub>O'' album, Hall and Oates made some permanent changes to their current band. Drummer [[Mickey Curry]], who had appeared on some ''Private Eyes'' tracks, including the title song, replaced [[Jerry Marotta]] full-time. Bassist [[Tom Wolk]], who had [[mimicry|mimed]] John Siegler's bass line in the "[[Private Eyes (song)|Private Eyes]]" video, replaced Siegler full-time.{{cn|date=February 2021}} These two joined the band's holdovers—lead guitar player [[G.E. Smith]], and saxophonist [[Charles DeChant]]. De Chant and Wolk continued to perform with the duo until Wolk's death in early 2010, while Curry returned for the ''[[Do It for Love (Hall & Oates album)|Do It for Love]]'' and ''[[Laughing Down Crying]]'' sessions.{{cn|date=February 2021}}

=== 1983–1984: ''Rock 'n Soul Part 1'' ===
By the fall of 1983, Hall and Oates were one of the biggest pop music acts in the United States. They had five Number 1 singles to their credit, two consecutive Top 10 albums and were one of the biggest names on [[MTV]].{{cn|date=February 2021}} Two covers of the 1957 [[Bobby Helms]] classic "[[Jingle Bell Rock]]" were recorded—one with Hall on lead vocals, and the other with Oates on lead vocals—and released in time for Christmas 1983, complete with a humorous video of the band, that received extensive airplay on [[MTV]]. In 1983, they released their first greatest hits album entitled ''[[Rock 'n Soul Part 1]]''. The album peaked at Number 7, and the two new songs that were written and recorded for that LP also became Top 10 hits as well.{{cn|date=February 2021}}

The first single released from this album, "[[Say It Isn't So (Hall & Oates song)|Say It Isn't So]]", battled six weeks for the Number 1 spot with [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Michael Jackson]]'s "[[Say Say Say]]" at the peak of ''[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]'' mania. "Say It Isn't So" remained at No. for an impressive four weeks from December 1983 to January 1984.{{cn|date=February 2021}}

{{listen|pos=right|filename=Hall & Oates - Adult Education.ogg|title="Adult Education"|Type=single}}
Hall and Oates's follow-up single "[[Adult Education (song)|Adult Education]]" received heavy airplay at both pop and black (urban contemporary) radio, and reached Number 8 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in April 1984. It was accompanied by a dark, New York City-oriented [[music video]] set in a cave. Oates later told [[VH1]] that the clip resembled the ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]'' TV show on [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|acid]].{{cn|date=February 2021}}

=== 1984–1985: ''Big Bam Boom'' ===
Hall and Oates returned to the studio in 1984 after a rest period to begin work on the ''[[Big Bam Boom]]'' album. This album had even more of an electronic, urban feel to it than ''H<sub>2</sub>O'', combining their song structure and vocalization with the latest technical advances in recording and playing.{{cn|date=February 2021}} The album employed some of the most sophisticated equipment ever used in the recording industry at the time (most notably the [[Synclavier]] II, one of the first computerized synthesizer workstations, as well as the [[Fairlight CMI]]). Noted [[remix]] and hip-hop icon [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]] worked very closely with the duo as a consultant, and produced dance remixes of four of the album's singles.{{cn|date=February 2021}}

The lead-off song "Dance on Your Knees" (written by Hall and Baker) is basically an homage to [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]]'s song "[[White Lines (Don't Don't Do It)]]".{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Released in late 1984, the first single from the LP, "[[Out of Touch (song)|Out of Touch]]", became the group's sixth number 1 hit on December 8, 1984. "[[Method of Modern Love]]", which debuted on the pop charts while "Out of Touch" was at number 1, reached number 5 in February 1985. "Some Things Are Better Left Unsaid" reached number 18, and "Possession Obsession" (a song in which Oates sings lead) reached number 30 in 1985 as well. The group's "Live Thru '85" tour to promote the album began in November 1984, sponsored by [[Pontiac (automobile)|Pontiac]]'s latest sports car, the [[Fiero]]. In addition, Pontiac allowed Oates, a skilled amateur racer, to drive in Pontiac's factory [[IMSA GTU]] race car in Camel GT pro races. In April 1984, the Recording Industry Association of America named Hall & Oates the most successful duo in rock history.<ref name="Our Kind of Soul Goldmine"/>

=== 1985–1988: ''Live at the Apollo'' and other projects ===
Hall and Oates have almost always toured extensively for each album release. But in 1985, the duo took a break after the release of their ''[[Live at the Apollo (Hall & Oates album)|Live at the Apollo]]'' album with [[David Ruffin]] and [[Eddie Kendricks]]—voices of [[The Temptations]] and two of their heroes.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> This was RCA's second attempt at a live Hall and Oates album, following the 1978 release ''[[Livetime]]''.{{cn|date=February 2021}} ''Live at the Apollo'' was released primarily to fulfill the duo's contract with RCA, and contained a Top 20 Grammy-nominated hit with a medley of "[[The Way You Do the Things You Do]]" and "[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]";<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/hall-and-oates|title=Hall and Oates|website=Recording Academy Grammy Awards|date=November 23, 2020}}</ref> Ruffin and Kendrick had originally recorded both songs with the Temptations in 1964.

Hall and Oates had collaborated on the USA for Africa "[[We Are the World]]" project, with the former as one of the soloists and the latter as a chorus member, and performed at the [[Live Aid]] concert in Philadelphia, with Ruffin and Kendrick. The Hall and Oates band also backed up [[Mick Jagger]]'s performance at this show.{{cn|date=February 2021}}

Hall, Oates, Ruffin and Kendrick performed again at the MTV Video Music Awards in New York later that year, complete with an Apollo Theater-style marquee descending on the stage during their performance.{{cn|date=February 2021}}

In May 1985, Hall and Oates performed at the Nashville Municipal Auditorium.<ref name="Inc.1985">{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4yQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT48|title=Box Score Top Grossing Concerts|magazine=Billboard|date=June 1, 1985|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=48|volume=97|issue=22|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> Just prior to Live Aid, on July 4, they participated in Liberty Concert, an outdoor benefit concert at [[Liberty State Park]] in [[Jersey City]], [[New Jersey]] for the restoration of the [[Statue of Liberty]], which was filmed for [[HBO]]. It became a major music event, drawing an estimated crowd of over 60,000 people.{{cn|date=February 2021}}

In 1986, Hall scored a Top 5 US hit with "[[Dreamtime (Daryl Hall song)|Dreamtime]]", from his solo album ''[[Three Hearts in the Happy Ending Machine]]''. That album also included the Top 40 hit "[[Foolish Pride (Daryl Hall song)|Foolish Pride]]" and the Top 100 hit "Somebody Like You", later performed by the duo live on their "Behind the Music" set.{{cn|date=February 2021}} Although Oates did not have a solo hit as a singer, he did contribute a solo track to the film ''[[About Last Night (1986 film)|About Last Night]]'' and co-wrote (with [[Iva Davies]]) and performed backing vocals on the 1987 [[Icehouse (band)|Icehouse]] top 10 US hit "[[Electric Blue (song)|Electric Blue]]". Oates also worked as producer, co-songwriter and co-lead vocalist of the single "Love Is Fire" by [[The Parachute Club]], which was a top 40 hit in Canada in 1987.{{cn|date=February 2021}}

=== 1988–1990: Arista years ===
Hall and Oates signed with [[Arista Records]], their third record company, in 1987, shortly before the string of Top 10 hits ended, in [[Tommy Mottola]]'s effort to keep them under contract when their RCA obligation ran out. Their first album for the label, ''[[Ooh Yeah! (Hall & Oates album)|Ooh Yeah!]]'', included the hits "[[Everything Your Heart Desires]]"<ref name="LarkinSM"/> (Number 3 in May 1988—their last to make the Top 10), "Missed Opportunity", and "Downtown Life". Beginning with ''Ooh Yeah!'', album and single releases were credited as '''Daryl Hall John Oates''', with the '&' or 'and' missing between the duo's names. It was the last Hall and Oates album, other than greatest hits packages, to enjoy platinum success. They recorded one more album for Arista called ''[[Change of Season]]''. The album's first single "[[So Close (Hall & Oates song)|So Close]]" (co-produced by [[Jon Bon Jovi]]) reached Number 11 and was Hall & Oates's last major hit.<ref name="LarkinSM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Soul Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-733-9|page=108}}</ref> Another song from the album, "Don't Hold Back Your Love", was named by [[SOCAN]] as the second-most performed song in Canada for 1992;<ref name="Inc.1992">{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QhAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA48|title='Do it for you' does it at the SOCAN Awards|magazine=Billboard|date=November 14, 1992|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|author=Larry LeBlanc|page=48|volume=104|issue=46|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> it became a hit for Australian Sherbet front man, [[Daryl Braithwaite]], in his solo years, and has become a Hall and Oates staple in concert. ''Change of Season'' was a more mainstream rock album than their previous work. Despite the fact that ''Ooh Yeah!'' and ''Change of Season'' reached platinum and gold status respectively, they were perceived as disappointments. In 1989, they covered and did their own version of the [[The O'Jays|O'Jays]] song ''[[Love Train]]'' for the movie ''[[Earth Girls Are Easy]]''.{{cn|date=February 2021}}

=== 1991–2006: ''Do It for Love'' and Christmas album ===
The duo's occasional song-writing collaborator [[Janna Allen]] died of [[leukemia]] in 1993. Hall and Oates released the ''[[Marigold Sky]]'' album in 1997 (their first all-new studio album in seven years), which included an [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|Adult Contemporary]] hit "Promise Ain't Enough". They also released a "[[VH1]] Behind the Music" ''Greatest Hits'' package shortly after appearing on the show in 2002. At the same time, Daryl and Sara, professional/personal collaborators, broke off their romantic relationship after some three decades.{{cn|date=February 2021}} Their friendship is still apparently strong; he has noted her help in his recovery from his 2005 attack of [[Lyme disease]]. Hall and Oates released the ''[[Do It for Love (Hall & Oates album)|Do It for Love]]'' album in 2003, whose title track was a number one Adult Contemporary hit. They also released the ''Hall & Oates Live'' DVD from an [[A&E Network|A&E]] ''[[Live by Request]]'' special. This album was the first release (and first success) for their newest joint venture U-Watch Records. Hall has also released the solo albums ''[[Soul Alone]]'' (1993) and ''[[Can't Stop Dreaming]]'' (originally released in Japan in 1996), and a live two-disc solo album titled ''Live in Philadelphia'' (2004).{{cn|date=February 2021}}

Hall and Oates covered [[Elton John]]'s "[[Philadelphia Freedom (song)|Philadelphia Freedom]]" on the 1991 John/[[Bernie Taupin|Taupin]] tribute album "[[Two Rooms: Celebrating the Songs of Elton John & Bernie Taupin|Two Rooms]]", saying in the booklet: "We chose 'Philadelphia Freedom' because the music is so close to our hearts, and the lyrics represent the way we feel about Philadelphia."{{cn|date=February 2021}} Oates released his own solo album in 2002 entitled ''[[Phunk Shui]]'' and a companion [[John Oates: Live at the Historic Wheeler Opera House|live concert DVD]]. Hall and Oates also released their first CD of (mostly) covers, ''[[Our Kind of Soul]]'', in 2004. It includes some of their favorite [[R&B]] songs, such as "[[I'll Be Around (The Spinners song)|I'll Be Around]]" (their first Hot 100 entry in over a decade), "[[Love T.K.O.]]", and [[Dan Hartman]]'s "[[I Can Dream About You]]", among others. Hall and Oates remained on the touring circuit, traveling nearly as much as they did in years past. In addition, a DVD of live performances of the songs from ''Our Kind of Soul'' was released in November 2005.{{cn|date=February 2021}}

Hall and Oates released a [[Christmas music|Christmas]] album, ''[[Home for Christmas (Hall & Oates album)|Home for Christmas]]'', on October 3, 2006, which contained two Christmas originals and covers, including a version of "[[It Came Upon a Midnight Clear]]", which became their second number one Adult Contemporary hit.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/chart_beat/bonus.jsp|title=Fred Bronson, Chart Beat|magazine=Billboard|date=December 21, 2006|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061225114245/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/chart_beat/bonus.jsp|archive-date=December 25, 2006}}</ref>

There were two notable nationally televised appearances for the duo in late 2008. On October 27, Oates sang the [[National Anthem]] before Game 5 of the [[2008 World Series]] at [[Citizens Bank Park]] in [[Philadelphia]] (Hall had taken sick, and the game was called on account of rain after the top of the 6th inning, but resumed on October 29, and the [[Philadelphia Phillies|Phillies]] won, claiming their first [[World Series]] Championship in 28 years).<ref>{{cite press-release|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20081026&content_id=3646206&vkey=pr_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb|title=MLB.com: Musical performers set for Game 5 of 2008 World Series|publisher=[[Major League Baseball]]|date=October 26, 2008|access-date=September 13, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107005330/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20081026&content_id=3646206&vkey=pr_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb|archive-date=November 7, 2012}}</ref> (Though born in New York, Oates was raised in a suburb of Philadelphia and attended [[Temple University]].<ref name="Oates bio"/>) Then, on December 11, both Hall and Oates appeared on the year's last episode of ''[[The Daily Show]]'' with Jon Stewart.
