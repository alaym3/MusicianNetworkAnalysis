Retrieved on February 4, 2018.</ref> (born November 19, 1989), known professionally by his stage name '''Tyga''' (a [[backronym]] for '''Thank you God always'''), is an American rapper.<ref>{{cite web|title=Thank You God Always=Tyga|url=https://twitter.com/Tyga/status/9131093992|publisher=T-Raww (Tyga) on Twitter|access-date=October 8, 2012|date=February 14, 2010}}</ref> After a number of independent releases, Tyga signed a recording contract with [[Young Money Entertainment]], [[Cash Money Records]] and [[Republic Records]] in 2008. His major label debut ''[[Careless World: Rise of the Last King]]'' was released in 2011 and included the successful singles "[[Rack City]]", "[[Faded (Tyga song)|Faded]]" (featuring [[Lil Wayne]]), "[[Far Away (Tyga song)|Far Away]]" (featuring [[Chris Richardson]]), "[[Still Got It]]" (featuring [[Drake (musician)|Drake]]), and "[[Make It Nasty]]". The album's success was followed up with ''[[Hotel California (Tyga album)|Hotel California]]'' (2013) and ''[[Fan of a Fan: The Album]]'' (2015), in collaboration with singer [[Chris Brown]].

Due to disagreements with Young Money, Tyga's next album, ''[[The Gold Album: 18th Dynasty]]'' was released independently on June 23, 2015. The album, executively produced by [[Kanye West]], became his lowest selling album to that point, selling 5,000 [[Billboard 200#Incorporation of streaming data and track sales|album equivalent units]] in its first week.<ref name=hotnewhiphop_sales>{{cite web |url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/charts-dont-lie-news.16292.html |title=Charts Don't Lie: July 4th |last=Smith |first=Trevor |website=HotNewHipHop.com|date=July 4, 2015 |access-date=July 4, 2015}}</ref>

After a long period of poor sales and negative reviews from previous material, his May 2018 single, "[[Taste (song)|Taste]]" (featuring [[Offset (rapper)|Offset]]), peaked at number 8 on the ''[[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], being his first [[Billboard Top 40|Top 40]] single since "[[Ayo (song)|Ayo]]" with [[Chris Brown]] in 2015.

==Early life==
Micheal Ray Stevenson was born in [[Compton, California]], on November 19, 1989,<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web | url = https://www.allmusic.com/artist/tyga-mn0000482959/biography | title= Artist Biography [Tyga]|first=David |last=Jeffries|publisher= [[AllMusic.com]] | access-date=February 17, 2015}}</ref> and raised there until he "was about 11, 12", before moving to adjacent [[Gardena, California|Gardena]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkPIdQQJWkk&t=2m30s |title=Tyga: Yes, I'm From Compton |publisher=Power 106 Los Angeles YouTube channel|time=02:30 |date=December 21, 2012 |access-date=February 28, 2015}}</ref> He is of [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] and [[Jamaican people|Jamaican]] descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7_8M-6wA8A |title=Tyga talks about his Vietnamese and Jamaican origin |publisher=TygaTygaTv YouTube channel|date=June 18, 2011 |access-date=June 2, 2013}}</ref> His mother was born in Vietnam and has the maiden name [[Nguyen]].<ref name="californiabirthindex" /> He grew up listening to [[Fabolous]], [[Lil Wayne]], [[Cam'ron]] and [[Eminem]] among many others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/10/interview-tyga-upcoming-album-hotel-california-good-vs-ymcmb-blogs-corny |title=Interview: Tyga Talks Upcoming Album "Hotel California," G.O.O.D. vs. YMCMB, and Why Blogs Are Corny Now |publisher=Complex |date=October 8, 2012 |access-date=June 2, 2013}}</ref>

On December 3, 2012, debate arose concerning Tyga's upbringing. Tyga claimed to have been brought up in the low [[socioeconomic]] area of Compton, but in leaked footage from the unaired [[television show]] ''Bustas,'' he claimed he grew up in a "well-to-do" home in [[San Fernando Valley|the Valley]], where his parents drove a [[Range Rover]]. He also claimed that he attained his nickname from his mother calling him [[Tiger Woods]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/07/entertainment/la-et-ms-tyga-embarrassing-reality-show-past-20121207 |title = Tyga's embarrassing reality show past exposed |date=December 7, 2012|work =[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=February 28, 2015}}</ref> There has been speculation that his claims on the show were satirical and not to be taken seriously. Tyga responded to the video's leak on [[Twitter]]: "When u 14 an ambitious u don't give a fuk about anything. Scripted tv isn't that what we all live for. Hahahaha."<ref>{{cite tweet|url=https://twitter.com/Tyga/status/275761862577123329|access-date=February 28, 2015|user=Tyga|date=December 4, 2012|title=When u 14 an ambitious u don't give a fuk about anything.

==Career==
===2007–2010: ''No Introduction'' and mixtapes===
Stevenson's career began with him releasing a multitude of demo tapes and mixtapes. His 2007 debut mixtape, ''Young On Probation'', garnered the attention of fellow California rapper and [[Gym Class Heroes]] lead vocalist, [[Travie McCoy]]. Seeing talent in the young artist, McCoy offered him a record deal with the independent label [[DCD2 Records]] (known then as Decaydence Records). Stevenson also formed the record label G.E.D. Inc. (Grinding every day, Getting every dollar, or Getting educated daily) around the time, the same imprint that helped launch the career of fellow [[West Coast hip hop|West Coast]] rapper [[Schoolboy Q]], with whom he's worked with early in his career. Tyga also has a ''G.E.D. Inc'' tattoo above his right eyebrow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://karencivil.com/2012/02/29/school-boy-q-discusses-tyga-the-g-e-d-movement/|title=School Boy Q Discusses Tyga & The G.E.D Movement|date=February 29, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://theurbandaily.cassiuslife.com/26741/is-tyga-the-new-king-of-the-compton-jungle/|title=Is Tyga The New King of the Compton Jungle?|date=July 29, 2008}}</ref>

On June 10, 2008, Tyga released his debut independent album, ''[[No Introduction]]'', on [[DCD2 Records|Decaydance Records]].<ref name=ProHipHop>(April 7, 2008).

Accessed May 9, 2008.</ref> The album was preceded by the single "[[Coconut Juice (song)|Coconut Juice]]", featuring McCoy. One of the songs from this album, "Diamond Life", was used in the video games ''[[Need for Speed: Undercover]]'' and ''[[Madden NFL 2009]]'', as well as in the 2009 movie ''[[Fighting (2009 film)|Fighting]]''.

In late 2008, Tyga signed a new record deal with [[Lil Wayne]]'s [[Young Money Entertainment]], which was a subsidiary of [[Cash Money Records]] at the time. Tyga met Wayne at the 2008 [[Video Music Awards|VMA]]'s, performing the remix of [[Fall Out Boy]]'s "[[This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race]]". He was first featured on the song "[[Bedrock (song)|Bedrock]]" by Young Money soon after signing to the label. He later released the mixtape ''Fan of a Fan'' with singer [[Chris Brown]] and producers DJ Ill Will and DJ Rockstar. It features other artists such as [[Bow Wow (rapper)|Bow Wow]], Lil Wayne, and [[Kevin McCall]] featured in several tracks. Four tracks ("Holla at Me", "G Shit", "[[No Bullshit]]" and "[[Deuces (song)|Deuces]]") are also accompanied by music videos. The track "Deuces" was released as the lead single of the mixtape and reached No. 14 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number 1 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] by August 26, 2010. The track has also been nominated for [[Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]] at the [[53rd Grammy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.datpiff.com/DJ_Ill_Will_Dj_Rockstar_Chris_Brown_Tyga_Fan.m120319.html |title=Chris Brown & Tyga - Fan Of A Fan Hosted by DJ Ill Will & Dj Rockstar // Free Mixtape @ |publisher=Datpiff.com |date=May 17, 2010 |access-date=August 12, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=tyga|chart=Hot 100}} |title=Top 100 Music Hits, Top 100 Music Charts, Top 100 Songs & The Hot 100 |publisher=Billboard.com |access-date=August 12, 2011}}</ref> The track, among others, was on the track list of Chris Brown's fourth studio album, ''[[F.A.M.E.

===2011–2012: ''Careless World: Rise of the Last King''===
''Careless World: Rise of the Last King'' was his second studio album. The album was released on February 21, 2012, on Young Money Entertainment, [[Cash Money Records]], and [[Universal Republic Records]]. ''Careless World: Rise of the Last King'' is a move to the rapping style he featured in the collaboration album ''[[We Are Young Money]]'' rather than the [[pop rap|poppy dance]] element exemplified on his previous effort, ''[[No Introduction]]''.<ref name="Martin">{{cite web|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/reviews/tyga/careless-world/38039/|title=Tyga: "Careless World"|last=Martin|first=Andrew|access-date=June 28, 2010|location=Prefixmag}}</ref> Tyga stated that the album shows he has grown up but still relates to the kids. In preparation for the album, Tyga released the mixtape ''#BitchImTheShit'' in December 2011.

The first official single, "[[Far Away (Tyga Song)|Far Away]]", was released on May 17, 2011, and peaked at 86 on the Billboard Hot 100.

It was originally listed on Tyga's ''Well Done 2'' mixtape, and was added to the album after it gained commercial success. It debuted at number 94 on the Billboard Hot 100, and has peaked at number 8 since then.  The fourth official single, "[[Faded (Tyga song)|Faded]]", was released on January 13, 2012. It peaked on the [[Hot 100]] at No. 33.

Tyga's sixth single, "[[Do My Dance]]" which features [[2 Chainz]] was released on October 2, 2012, and peaked at No. 79 on the Billboard Hot 100. He has released various mixtapes such as well-acclaimed ''#BitchImTheShit'' and ''[[Well Done 3]]''.
