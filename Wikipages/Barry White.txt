A two-time [[Grammy Award]]–winner known for his [[bass-baritone]] voice and romantic image, his greatest success came in the 1970s as a solo singer and with [[The Love Unlimited Orchestra]], crafting many enduring soul, [[funk]], and [[disco]] songs such as his two biggest hits: "[[You're the First, the Last, My Everything]]" and "[[Can't Get Enough of Your Love, Babe]]".

White recorded 19 studio albums during the course of his career, but multiple versions and compilations were released worldwide that were certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold]], 41 of which also attained platinum status. White had 20 gold and 10 platinum singles, with worldwide record sales in excess of 100&nbsp;million records, and is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sgvtribune.com/arts-and-entertainment/20130920/steve-smith-christine-mcvie-rejoins-the-mac-cher-says-no-to-russia-joel-santana-honored|title=Barry White Gets Walk of Fame Star|first=Steve|last=Smith|work=[[San Gabriel Valley Tribune]]|date=September 20, 2013|access-date=2014-01-06}}</ref> His influences included [[James Cleveland]], [[Ray Charles]],  [[Aretha Franklin]], [[The Supremes]], [[The Four Tops]], and [[Marvin Gaye]].

==Early life==

His parents never married, so his mother gave him her last name, but he later took on the surname of his father.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTR2xIYhzFc|title=BTM - Barry White|last=Ramardo T.

White grew up listening to his mother's classical music collection and first took to the piano, emulating what he heard on the records.

White has often been credited with playing piano, at age 11, on [[Jesse Belvin]]'s 1956 hit single, "[[Goodnight My Love (1956 song)|Goodnight My Love]]".<ref>Bobby Bennett and Sarah Smith, ''The Ultimate Soul Music Trivia Book: 501 Questions and Answers about Motown, Rhythm & Blues, and More'', Secaucus, NJ: Carol Pub.

Retrieved January 16, 2016.</ref> However, in a 1995 interview with the ''[[Boston Herald]]'', White denied writing or arranging the song. He believed the story was an exaggeration by journalists. While White and Belvin lived in the same neighborhood, Belvin was 12 years older than White.

White's voice deepened suddenly when he was 14.<ref name=katz/> He recalled: "[As a child], I had a normal squeaky kid voice. Then as a teenager, that completely changed. My mother cried because she knew her baby boy had become a man."

White was jailed for four months at the age of 16 for stealing $30,000 worth of [[Cadillac]] tires.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2386227.stm |title=Obituary: Barry White  |date=July 4, 2003 |work=BBC News}}</ref> While in jail, he listened to [[Elvis Presley]] singing "[[It's Now or Never (song)|It's Now or Never]]" on the radio,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ivorcasey.blogspot.com/|title=Ivor Casey|website=Ivorcasey.blogspot.com|access-date=August 26, 2018}}</ref> an experience he later credited with changing the course of his life.<ref>Barry White with Marc Eliot, ''Love Unlimited,'' New York: Broadway Books, 1999, p. 22.</ref>

==Music career==
{{More citations needed|section|date=July 2019}}

===1960s===
After his release from jail, White left gang life and began a musical career at the beginning of the 1960s in singing groups. He first released "Too Far to Turn Around" in 1960 as part of The Upfronts<ref name=discography>{{cite web|first=Pete |last=Old |url=http://members.chello.nl/p.klein6/Html/barry_white_discography.htm |title=Barry White Discography |publisher=Barry White Unlimited FanClub |access-date=March 16, 2012 }}</ref> before working for various small independent labels in Los Angeles. He also recorded several singles under his own name in the early 1960s, backed by vocal groups the Atlantics (for the Rampart and Faro labels) and the Majestics (for the Linda and Jordan labels).<ref name=discography/>  White had no involvement with [[Bob & Earl]]'s 1963 hit single "[[Harlem Shuffle]]", a song he has sometimes been credited with producing;<ref name=katz>White, Barry.

In 1965, White produced "Feel Aw Right" by the Bel Cantos, released on the [[Downey Records|Downey]] label.<ref>[http://www.45cat.com/record/d128us  "Feel Aw Right", The Bel-Cantos, Downey D-128], ''45cat.

In the mid-'60s, [[Bob Keane]] of [[Del-Fi Records]] hired him as an [[A&R]] man for his new Bronco Records imprint, and White started working with the label's artists, including [[Viola Wills]] and [[The Bobby Fuller Four]], as a songwriter, session musician, and arranger.<ref name="Larkin" /> He discovered singer [[Felice Taylor]] and arranged her song "[[I Feel Love Comin' On]]" co-written with his friend [[Paul Politi]]. It became a big hit in the UK.<ref name="allmusic" /> Other charting hits written by White and Politi for her included "[[It May Be Winter Outside (But in My Heart It's Spring)]]" and "[[Under the Influence of Love]]".

Retrieved February 16, 2013.</ref>

In 1969, White was signed by Forward Records of Los Angeles, a division of Transcontinental Entertainment Corporation, as a producer.<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=April 26, 1969|title=Singings|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/60s/1969/Billboard%201969-04-26.pdf|magazine=Billboard|pages=18}}</ref>

===1970s as producer===
In 1972, White got his big break producing a [[girl group]] he had discovered called [[Love Unlimited]].<ref name="Larkin"/> Formed in imitative style of the [[Motown]] girl group [[The Supremes]], the group members had gradually honed their talents with White for two years previously until they signed contracts with [[Uni Records]]. His friend [[Paul Politi]] hooked him up with music industry businessman Larry Nunes, who helped to finance their album. After it was recorded, Nunes took the recording to [[Russ Regan]], who was the head of the [[Uni Records|Uni]] label owned by [[MCA Inc.|MCA]]. The album, 1972's ''[[Love Unlimited (Love Unlimited album)|From A Girl's Point of View We Give to You... Love Unlimited]]'', became the first of White's string of long-titled albums and singles.

White produced, wrote and arranged their classic soul ballad "[[Walkin' in the Rain with the One I Love]]", which climbed to No. 14 in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] Pop chart and No. 6 on the ''Billboard'' R&B chart in late 1972. It became White's first million selling single as a writer and producer. This single also reached No. 12 in the UK chart. White's voice can clearly be heard in this piece as he plays the lover who answers the phone call of the female lead.<ref name="Larkin"/>

Soon after, Regan left Uni for [[20th Century Records]]. Without Regan, White's relationship with Uni soured. With his relationship with Uni over and Love Unlimited contract-bound with the label, White was able to switch both his production deal and the group to 20th Century Records. They recorded several other hits throughout the 1970s, "I Belong to You", which spent over five months on the ''Billboard'' R&B chart in 1974 including a week at No. 1 and "Under the Influence of Love Unlimited", which hit No. 3 on the ''Billboard'' Pop album charts.  White married the lead singer of the group, [[Glodean White|Glodean James]], on July 4, 1974.

===The Love Unlimited Orchestra===
In 1973, White created [[The Love Unlimited Orchestra]], a 40-piece orchestral group to be used originally as a backing band for the girl-group [[Love Unlimited]]. However, White had other plans, and in 1973 he released a single with "[[Love's Theme]]" (written by him and played by the Orchestra), which reached No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Pop charts. Later, in 1974, he made the first album of the Love Unlimited Orchestra, ''[[Rhapsody in White]]'', containing "Love's Theme". White would continue to make albums with the Orchestra, achieving some successes such as: "Rhapsody in White"; "Satin Soul"; "Forever in Love"; "Midnight Groove"; "[[My Sweet Summer Suite]]", Remake of "Theme From King Kong". The Orchestra ceased to make albums in 1983, but continued to support White as a backing band.

===1970s solo career===
White wanted to work with another act but decided to work with a solo male artist. While working on a few demos for a male singer, he made three song demos of himself singing and playing, but Nunes heard them and insisted that he re-record and release them himself as a solo recording artist. After arguing for days about it, White was finally persuaded to release the songs himself, although he was initially reluctant to step out behind the microphone.

He then wrote several other songs and recorded them for what eventually became an entire album of music. He was going to use the name "White Heat," but decided on using his given name instead. White was still hesitating up to the time the label copy was made. It eventually became White's first solo album, 1973's ''[[I've Got So Much to Give (album)|I've Got So Much to Give]]''. It included [[I've Got So Much to Give|the title track]] and his first solo chart hit, "[[I'm Gonna Love You Just a Little More Baby]]",<ref name="Larkin" /> which also rose to No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' R&B charts as well as No. 3 on the ''Billboard'' Pop charts in 1973 and stayed in the top 40 for many weeks.<ref name=":0" />

Other chart hits by White included "[[Never, Never Gonna Give You Up]]" (No. 2 R&B, No. 7 Pop in 1973), "[[Can't Get Enough of Your Love, Babe]]" (No. 1 Pop and R&B in 1974), "[[You're the First, the Last, My Everything]]" (No. 1 R&B, No. 2 Pop in 1974), "[[What Am I Gonna Do with You]]" (No. 1 R&B, No. 8 Pop in 1975), "Let the Music Play" (No. 4 R&B in 1976), "[[It's Ecstasy When You Lay Down Next to Me]]" (No. 1 R&B, No. 4 Pop in 1977) and "Your Sweetness Is My Weakness" (No. 2 R&B in 1978) and others. White also had a strong following in the UK, where he scored five Top 10 hits and a No. 1 for "You're the First, the Last, My Everything".<ref name="Larkin" />   Due to his large frame, facial hair, and deep voice, he was given the nickname "The Walrus of Love" in the UK.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jelbert |first1=Steve |title=Barry White, the Walrus of Love, dies aged 58 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/barry-white-the-walrus-of-love-dies-aged-58-94864.html |access-date=5 November 2020 |work=The Independent |agency=The Independent |publisher=Independent Digital News & Media Ltd |date=5 July 2003}}</ref>

After six years White left 20th Century in 1979 to launch his own label, Unlimited Gold, with [[Columbia Records|CBS/Columbia Records]].

===1980s===
Although his success on the pop charts slowed down as the disco era came to an end, he maintained a loyal following throughout his career. Despite several albums over the next three years, he failed to repeat his earlier successes, with no singles managing to reach the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, except for 1982's "Change," climbing into the Billboard R&B Top 20 (No. 12). His label venture was exacting a heavy financial cost on White, so he concentrated on mostly touring and finally folded his label in 1983.

After four years he signed with [[A&M Records]], and with the release of 1987's ''[[The Right Night & Barry White]]'', the single entitled "Sho' You Right" made it to the ''Billboard'' R&B charts, peaking at No. 17.

In 1989 he released ''[[The Man Is Back!]]'' and with it had three top 40 singles on the ''Billboard'' R&B charts: "Super Lover", which made it to No. 34, "I Wanna Do It Good to Ya", which made it to No. 26, and "When Will I See You Again", which made it to No. 32.

===1990s===
A 1970s nostalgia fad allowed White to enjoy a renewed wave of popularity in the 1990s. After participating in the song "[[The Secret Garden (Sweet Seduction Suite)]]" from [[Quincy Jones]]'s 1989 album ''[[Back on the Block]]'', White mounted an effective comeback with several albums, each more successful than the last. He returned to the top of the charts in 1991 with the album ''[[Put Me in Your Mix]]'', which reached No. 8 on the ''Billboard'' R&B Albums chart and the song by the same name reached No. 2 on the ''Billboard'' R&B singles chart.

In 1994, White released ''[[The Icon Is Love]]'', which went to No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' R&B album charts, and the single "[[Practice What You Preach (Barry White song)|Practice What You Preach]]" gave him his first No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' R&B singles chart in almost 20 years. The album was nominated for a Grammy in the [[Best R&B Album]] category, but lost to [[TLC (group)|TLC]]'s ''[[CrazySexyCool]]''.

In 1996, White recorded the [[duet]] "[[In Your Wildest Dreams (song)|In Your Wildest Dreams]]" with [[Tina Turner]]. 1996 also saw the release of ''[[Space Jam]]'' and [[Space Jam (soundtrack)|its soundtrack]], on which White had a duet with [[Chris Rock]], called "Basketball Jones," a remake of [[Cheech & Chong]]'s [[Basketball Jones|"Basketball Jones" from 1973]].

White's final album, 1999's ''[[Staying Power (album)|Staying Power]]'', resulted in his last hit song "[[Staying Power (Barry White song)|Staying Power]]," which placed No. 45 on the ''Billboard'' R&B charts. The single won him two [[Grammy Awards]] in the categories [[Best Male R&B Vocal Performance]] and [[Best Traditional R&B Vocal Performance]].<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/barry-white|title=Barry White|website=Recording Academy Grammy Awards|date=November 23, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/staying-power-mw0000242946/awards|title=Staying Power - Barry White - Awards - AllMusic|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=August 26, 2018}}</ref>

==Acting career==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2019}}
Over the course of his career, White sometimes did voice-over work for television and movies. He voiced the character Brother Bear in the film ''[[Coonskin (film)|Coonskin]]'' (1975), and also played the character Sampson in the movie's live-action segments. He appeared as himself in a few episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]''.  In the episode "[[Whacking Day]]", Bart and Lisa used his deep [[Bass (voice type)|bass singing voice]], played through loudspeakers placed on the ground, to lull and attract snakes, saving them from extermination. White was a fan of the show, and had reportedly contacted the staff about wanting to make a guest appearance. He made a second cameo in the episode "[[Krusty Gets Kancelled]]".

White played the role of a bus driver for a [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]] commercial in 1995, and he also portrayed the voice of a rabbit in a Good Seasons salad-dressing-mix commercial, singing a song called "You Can't Bottle Love". In addition, he did some work for car commercials, including for [[Oldsmobile]], and later on, [[Jeep]]. White also provided voice-over for [[Arby's]] Restaurant commercials on television and radio to promote its ''Market Fresh'' menu. White's voice can also be heard in [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] first [[iBook]] commercial. White made three guest appearances on the comedy-drama television series ''[[Ally McBeal]]'', as his music was often featured on the show in dream sequences.

=== Children ===
White had at least nine children.<ref name=":2" />

By the age of 16, White had fathered two children with his first wife Mary.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jul/07/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries|title=Barry White|last=Cartwright|first=Garth|date=July 6, 2003|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> They had four children together.<ref name=":0" /> In 2017, his son Darryl White from his first marriage sued his estate claiming he was cut off financially.<ref name=":3" />

White had a daughter, Denise Donnell born in 1962 to Gurtha Allen.

In 2016, she sued White's estate after she stopped receiving money.<ref name=":2" />

After White's death in 2003, his girlfriend Katherine Denton claimed her infant daughter was his biological child. Denton also claimed that she was owed money and personal items that White had promised to give her. Paternity tests revealed that he was not the father of her child and Denton subsequently lost her court case.<ref name=":2" />

===Health problems and death===

Due to a poor diet, White was overweight for most of his adult life and suffered from related health problems. He was also known to be a [[chain-smoking|heavy smoker]], reportedly smoking approximately 150 cigarettes a day; roughly between 7 and 8 packs.

While on-tour in the summer of 1995, White nearly collapsed after a concert. He took a break from performing that fall and on October 30 of that year, he was hospitalized after suffering a minor stroke due to [[hypertension|high blood pressure]]. He was in a coma for four days, but was discharged a week after coming out of it.

While touring with [[Earth, Wind & Fire]] in August 1999, White was forced to cancel a month's worth of tour dates owing to exhaustion, high blood pressure and a hectic schedule. Family, friends, and associates also reported that as the 2000s began, White was in such poor health that he could hardly stand up; his last performances suffered as a result.
In September 2002, White was hospitalized with kidney failure attributed to chronic [[hypertension|high blood pressure]]; he was also believed to have been [[diabetes mellitus|diabetic]]. While undergoing [[dialysis]] and awaiting a [[Kidney transplantation|kidney transplant]] in May 2003, White suffered a severe stroke, which forced him to retire from public life. He also suffered multiple seizures in his last few weeks.<ref name=":4">{{Cite magazine|last=Mitchell|first=Gail|date=July 19, 2003|title=Barry White Dead At 58|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/00s/2003/BB-2003-07-19.pdf|magazine=Billboard|pages=6}}</ref>

White's unstable health prevented him from receiving a new kidney and on July 4, 2003, he died at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in Los Angeles after suffering a severe [[cardiac arrest]]; he was 58.<ref name=":4" /><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3046650.stm "Singer Barry White dies"], BBC, July 5, 2003.</ref> His remains were cremated, and the ashes were scattered in the ocean off the Californian coast.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}
