Andrews lived briefly with Wells and her brother, John<ref>GRO Register of Births: JUN 1938 2a 564 Surrey NW – John D. Wells, mmn = Morris</ref> in Surrey. In 1940, Wells sent her to live with her mother and stepfather, who Wells thought would be better able to provide for his talented daughter's artistic training. According to Andrews's 2008 autobiography ''Home'', while Andrews had been used to calling her stepfather  "Uncle Ted", her mother suggested it would be more appropriate to refer to her stepfather as "Pop", while her father remained "Dad" or "Daddy" to her, a change which she disliked. {{citation needed|date=January 2021}} The Andrews family was "very poor" and "lived in a bad [[slum]] area of London," at the time, stating that the war "was a very black period in my life." According to Andrews, her stepfather was violent and an alcoholic.<ref name="Brockes2008-03-30" /> He twice, while drunk, tried to get into bed with his stepdaughter, resulting in Andrews fitting a lock on her door.<ref name="Brockes2008-03-30" />

As the stage career of her mother and stepfather improved, they were able to afford better surroundings, first to [[Beckenham]] and then, as the war ended, back to the Andrews's hometown of [[Hersham]]. The family took up residence at the Old Meuse, in West Grove, Hersham, a house (now demolished) where Andrews's maternal grandmother had served as a maid.<ref name="windeler20" />  Andrews's stepfather sponsored lessons for her, first at the independent arts educational school Cone-Ripman School ([[Arts Educational Schools, London|ArtsEd]]) in London, and thereafter with concert soprano and voice instructor Madame [[Lilian Stiles-Allen]]. Andrews said of Stiles-Allen, "She had an enormous influence on me," adding, "She was my third mother&nbsp;– I've got more mothers and fathers than anyone in the world." In her memoir ''Julie Andrews – My Star Pupil'', Stiles-Allen records, "The range, accuracy and tone of Julie's voice amazed me&nbsp;... she had possessed the rare gift of [[absolute pitch]]",<ref name= Stirling>{{cite book| last= Stirling| first= Richard| title= Julie Andrews: An Intimate Biography| publisher= Portrait| year= 2007 |isbn= 978-0-7499-5135-1}}</ref> though Andrews herself refutes this in her 2008 autobiography ''Home''.<ref name="spindle1" /><ref name="windeler22">Windeler (1970), pp. 22–23</ref> According to Andrews, "Madame was sure that I could do [[Mozart]] and [[Rossini]], but, to be honest, I never was".<ref name= Stirling />{{rp|24}} Of her own voice, she says, "I had a very pure, white, thin voice, a four-octave range – dogs would come from miles around."<ref name= Stirling />{{rp|24}} After Cone-Ripman School, Andrews continued her academic education at the nearby Woodbrook School, a local state school in Beckenham.<ref>{{cite book| first= Timothy| last= White | year= 1998| title= The Entertainers| page= 111| publisher= [[Billboard Books]]}}</ref>

=== 1940s ===
Beginning in 1945, and for the next two years, Andrews performed spontaneously and unbilled on stage with her parents. "Then came the day when I was told I must go to bed in the afternoon because I was going to be allowed to sing with Mummy and Pop in the evening," Andrews explained. During her initial shows, Andrews stood on a beer crate to sing into the microphone, performing a solo or a duet with her stepfather, while her mother played piano. She later stated that "it must have been ghastly, but it seemed to go down all right."<ref name="windeler23">Windeler (1970), pp 23–24</ref><ref>Spindle, p. 2, suggests that Andrews began a few years of stage work with her parents in 1946.</ref> Fellow child entertainer [[Petula Clark]], three years her senior, recalled touring around the UK by train to sing for the troops alongside Andrews; they slept in the luggage racks. Clark later said "It was fun—and not a lot of kids were having fun".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/31/petula-clark-elvis-angled-for-a-threesome-he-was-raring-to-go |title=Petula Clark: 'Elvis angled for a threesome – he was raring to go' |newspaper=The Guardian |author=Elle Hunt |date= 31 July 2019}}</ref>

Andrews had her career breakthrough when her stepfather introduced her to managing director [[Val Parnell]], whose [[Moss Empires]] controlled prominent performance venues in London. At age 12, Andrews made her professional solo debut at the [[London Hippodrome]], singing the difficult aria "Je suis Titania" from ''[[Mignon]]'' as part of a musical [[revue]], called "Starlight Roof", on 22 October 1947. She played at the Hippodrome for one year.<ref name="spindle1" /><ref>Windeler (1970), pp 24–26</ref> Of her role in "Starlight Roof," Andrews recalled: "There was this wonderful American person and comedian, [[Wally Boag]], who made balloon animals. He would say, 'Is there any little girl or boy in the audience who would like one of these?' And I would rush up onstage and say, 'I'd like one, please.' And then he would chat to me and I'd tell him I sang&nbsp;... I was fortunate in that I absolutely stopped the show cold. I mean, the audience went crazy."<ref>Boag, Wally and Sands, Gene. ''Wally Boag, Clown Prince of Disneyland'', Disney Enterprises, Inc. 2009, p. 39</ref>

On 1 November 1948, a thirteen-year-old Andrews became the youngest solo performer ever to be seen in a [[Royal Variety Performance]] before [[King George VI]] and the future [[Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] at the [[London Palladium]]. Andrews performed alongside singer [[Danny Kaye]], dancers the [[Nicholas Brothers]], and the comedy team George and Bert Bernard.<ref>Windeler (1970), p. 26. "Julie, who was described in the official announcement 14 October as 'a 13-year-old coloratura soprano with the voice of an adult,' was the youngest solo performer ever chosen to perform before royalty at the Palladium. She sang the British National Anthem. She ran onto stage in front of Danny Kaye wearing a white A-frame dress and begins to sing, the audience join in. The evening was held in the presence of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth (The Queen Mother). The show was presented by Val Parnell."</ref><ref name="spindle3">Spindle, p. 3</ref>

Andrews subsequently followed her parents into radio and television.<ref name="windeler26">Windeler (1970), pp 26–27.</ref> She performed in musical interludes of the [[BBC Light Programme]] comedy show ''Up the Pole'' and was a cast member in ''[[Educating Archie]]'', from 1950 to 1952.<ref name="spindle3" /> She reportedly made her television début on the BBC programme ''RadiOlympia Showtime'' on 8 October 1949.<ref>[http://www.legacyrecordings.com/Artists/Biography.aspx?ArtistGuid=3e58f21d-30b8-4e27-85f7-5b42cf61a03e Ruhlmann, William.

On 30 September 1954, the eve of her 19th birthday, Andrews made her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut as Polly Browne in the London musical ''[[The Boy Friend (musical)|The Boy Friend]]''.<ref name="BBC" /> Andrews was recommended to director [[Vida Hope]] for the part by actress [[Hattie Jacques]], whom Andrews regards as a "catalyst" for her career.<ref name="home2">{{cite book |last1=Andrews |first1=Julie |title=Home: A Memoir of My Early Years |date=1 April 2008 |publisher=Hyperion |isbn=978-0-7868-6565-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UaoZUunPq_EC |access-date=23 January 2021}}</ref> Eve Benda recognized her special talent and predicted her stardom.  Andrews was anxious about moving to New York; at the time, she was both breadwinner and caretaker for her family, and took the part upon her father's encouragement.<ref name="home2" /> She stated that at the time, she had "no idea" how to research a role or study a script, and cites [[Cy Feuer]]'s direction as being "phenomenal".<ref name="home2" /> ''The Boy Friend'' became a hit, with Andrews receiving praise; critics called her the stand-out of the show.<ref name="spindle4">Spindle, pp. 4–5.</ref><ref name="home2" />

In 1955, Andrews signed to appear with [[Bing Crosby]] in the [[television film]], ''[[High Tor (play)|High Tor]]''. It filmed in November 1955 in Los Angeles and was Andrews's first screen project, which she described as "daunting".<ref name="home2" /> ''High Tor'' was televised the following March before a live audience for the ''[[Ford Star Jubilee]]'', receiving lukewarm reviews.<ref name="windeler41">Windeler, pp. 41–42.</ref><ref name="home2" />  Near the end of her one-year run with ''The Boy Friend'', Andrews was approached to audition to [[Alan Jay Lerner]] and [[Frederick Loewe]] for the role of [[Eliza Doolittle]] in ''[[My Fair Lady]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|title=In Step With: Julie Andrews |work=Parade Magazine |date=17 October 2004 |url=http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2004/edition_10-17-2004/in_step_with_0 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name="home2" /> She was offered the part by [[Richard Rodgers]] during her third reading.<ref name="home2" /> She later wrote that she felt she could "be Eliza, could find and understand her" if only someone were to "gently unravel the knotted&nbsp;... string inside my stomach".<ref name="home2" />

[[File:Richard Burton and Julie Andrews Camelot.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Andrews as Queen [[Guinevere]] with [[Richard Burton]] as King Arthur in the musical ''Camelot'']]
During rehearsals, director [[Moss Hart]] spent forty-eight consecutive hours solely with Andrews, where they "hammered through each scene"; Andrews later stated that "the good man had stripped [her] feelings bare&nbsp;[...] molded, kneaded, and helped [her] become the character of Eliza [..] [and made] her part of [her] soul."<ref name="home2" /> Andrews referred it as the best acting lesson she had ever received, later cementing the role with her "own touches and flourishes" and continuing to work on the character throughout her two-year run.<ref name="home2" />  On 15 March 1956, ''My Fair Lady'' opened on Broadway at the [[Mark Hellinger Theatre]]. The play was a huge success with both the audience and critics, though soon after opening she learned she needed to tone down her learned [[cockney]] accent so that the American audience could understand her, a change which was reversed at the West End performance a year later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FEAJt0hnfs|title=Interview with Rex Harrison & Julie Andrews on Opening Night of My Fair Lady, London (1958)|date=30 April 1958|access-date=7 January 2021}}</ref> Andrews describes her performances as Eliza as "the great learning period" of her life.<ref name="home2" />

Rodgers was so impressed with Andrews's talent that concurrent with her run in ''My Fair Lady'' she was featured in the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] television musical ''[[Cinderella (Rodgers and Hammerstein musical)|Cinderella]]'', which was written especially for her.<ref name="spindle4" /><ref name="home2" />  ''Cinderella'' was broadcast live on [[CBS]] on 31 March 1957 under the musical direction of [[Alfredo Antonini]] and had an estimated 107&nbsp;million viewers.<ref>[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/88832.html Gans, Andrew.

Between 1956 and 1962, Andrews guest-starred on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' (15 July 1956), and also appeared on ''[[The Dinah Shore Chevy Show]]'', ''[[What's My Line?]]'', ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'', ''[[The Bell Telephone Hour]]'', and ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]''. In June 1962, Andrews co-starred in ''[[Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall]]'', a CBS special with [[Carol Burnett]]. In 1960, Lerner and Loewe again cast her in a period musical as Queen [[Guinevere]] in ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'', along with [[Richard Burton]] (as [[King Arthur]]) and newcomer [[Robert Goulet]]. Andrews called the work "monumental" due to the heavy set costuming and detailed literary themes.<ref name="home2" /> Camelot premiered at the [[Majestic Theatre (Broadway)|Majestic Theatre]] to "adequate" reviews, which Andrews credited to off-set production issues and comparisons to ''My Fair Lady''.<ref name="home2" /> The musical was substantially revised both before and during the show's Broadway run.<ref name="home2" />

=== 1960s ===
Casting for the [[My Fair Lady (film)|film adaptation]] of ''My Fair Lady'' began in 1962; Jay Lerner hoped for Andrews to reprise her role, but [[Warner Brothers]] studio head [[Jack L. Warner|Jack Warner]] decided Andrews lacked sufficient name recognition; the part was played by the established film actress [[Audrey Hepburn]], with the bulk of the singing dubbed by [[Marni Nixon]]. As Warner later recalled that the decision was made for financial purposes, stating that "In my business, I have to know who brings people and their money to a cinema box office. Audrey Hepburn had never made a financial flop."<ref>{{cite web | title=''My Fair Lady'' (1964) at Reel Classics | url=http://www.reelclassics.com/Musicals/Fairlady/fairlady.htm | access-date=18 December 2005 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051220220233/http://www.reelclassics.com/Musicals/Fairlady/fairlady.htm | archive-date=20 December 2005 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Andrews later reflected that she understood her experience on Broadway "was within a very small pond" but wished she had been able to record her performance for posterity.<ref name="home2" />

In 1963, Andrews began work in the [[Mary Poppins (character)|titular role]] of [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s musical film ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]''. [[Walt Disney]] had seen her performance in ''Camelot'' and subsequently offered her the role; Andrews initially declined because of pregnancy, returning to London to give birth, but Disney firmly insisted, saying, "We'll wait for you."<ref name="MaryPoppinsDVD">''Mary Poppins'' 40th Anniversary Edition DVD.</ref> After the birth of her daughter, she received a call from [[P. L. Travers]], author of the ''Mary Poppins'' book series, who told her, "Well, you're much too pretty of course. But you've got the nose for it."<ref name="home2" /> Disney rented a house in [[Toluca Lake, Los Angeles]] for her family to reside in during production. Andrews relied largely on instinct for her portrayal, conceptualising her background and giving the character a "particular walk" and a turned-out stance to suit her ladylike sensibility.<ref name="home2" /> Andrews referred to production as "unrelenting" given the physical exertion and technical details, saying that she "could not have asked" for a better introduction to film.<ref name="home2" />

=== Loss of singing voice ===
Andrews was forced to quit the ''Victor/Victoria'' stage production towards the end of the Broadway run in 1997 when she developed hoarseness in her voice. She subsequently underwent surgery at New York's [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai Hospital]], reportedly to remove non-cancerous [[Vocal fold nodule|nodules]] from her throat,<ref name="BBC" /> though she later stated the hoarseness was due to "a certain kind of muscular striation [that] happens on the vocal cords"—itself the result of a strain from ''Victor/Victoria'' (she added "I didn't have cancer, I didn't have nodules, I didn't have anything.")<ref>{{Cite episode|title=The Sound of Music Reunion|series=[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]|date=28 October 2010|season=25}}</ref> She emerged from the surgery with permanent damage that destroyed the purity of her singing and made her speaking voice raspy. In 1999, she filed a malpractice suit against the doctors at Mount Sinai Hospital, including Scott Kessler and Jeffrey Libin, who had operated on her throat. Originally, the doctors assured Andrews that she should regain her voice within six weeks, but Andrews's stepdaughter, [[Jennifer Edwards]], said in 1999 "it's been two years, and it [her singing voice] still hasn't returned."<ref name="sue over lost voice">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/565852.stm ''Andrews sues over lost voice''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309045553/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/565852.stm|date=9 March 2008}}.

Subsequently, from 2000 onwards, [[Steven M.

When a young Andrews was taken by her parents to be examined by a [[ENT specialist|throat specialist]], the doctor concluded that she had "an almost adult [[larynx]]."<ref name=":0" /> Despite the continual encouragement to pursue opera by her voice teacher, English soprano [[Lilian Stiles-Allen]], Andrews herself felt that her voice was unsuited for the genre and "too big a stretch". At the time, Andrews described her own voice as "extremely high and thin", feeling that it lacked "the necessary guts and weight for opera", preferring musical theatre instead. 

As Andrews aged, so did her voice, which began to naturally deepen. Losing her vast upper register, her "top notes" became increasingly difficult to sing while "her middle register matured into the warm golden tone" for which she has become known, according to Tim Wong of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url = http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/culture/timwong/100075040/julie-andrews-the-operatic-sensation-that-never-was/|title = Julie Andrews, the operatic sensation that never was|date = 26 May 2014|access-date = 23 August 2014|website = The Daily Telegraphy|publisher = Telegraph Media Group Limited|last = Wong|first = Tim|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160306122658/http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/culture/timwong/100075040/julie-andrews-the-operatic-sensation-that-never-was/|archive-date = 6 March 2016|url-status=dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Musically, she had always preferred singing music that was "bright and sunny", choosing to avoid songs that were sad or otherwise written in a minor key, for fear of losing her voice "in a mess of emotion". She cited this as another reason for avoiding opera.<ref name=":0" />
