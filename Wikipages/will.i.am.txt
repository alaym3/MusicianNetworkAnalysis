==Music career==

===1988–2000: Formations and the Black Eyed Peas===
[[File:Flickr - moses namkung - Black Eyed Peas 1.jpg|thumb|will.i.am performing with [[the Black Eyed Peas]] in June 2009]]
In the summer of 1988 will.i.am began his music career when, as an eighth-grader, he met up with fellow rapper Allan Pineda ([[apl.de.ap]]) and fellow student Dante Santiago. They began performing together around Los Angeles and were soon discovered by rapper/entrepreneur [[Eazy-E]], who signed them to his label [[Ruthless Records]] in 1992. At the time, Will was known as "Will 1X". Atban Klann's first ever official track, "Merry Muthafuckin' Xmas", was included on Eazy-E's EP ''[[5150: Home 4 tha Sick]]''. After this, the trio began recording an album, "Grass Roots", with the help of producers Mookie Mook and DJ Motiv8, but the album was never released due to Eazy-E's tragic death in 1995. Subsequently, they changed their name to Black Eyed Pods, and Will replaced Dante with Jaime Gomez, better known under his stage name of [[Taboo (rapper)|Taboo]]. In 1997, they once again changed their name, this time to [[the Black Eyed Peas]], and began recording their first album, ''[[Behind the Front]]'', with the help of soul singer [[Kim Hill (soul musician)|Kim Hill]]. They were soon signed to [[Interscope Records]], and released their debut single, "[[Joints & Jam]]", in early 1998. The album was successful enough for the group's contract to be renewed, and in 2000, a second album, ''[[Bridging the Gap (Black Eyed Peas album)|Bridging the Gap]]'', was released.

===2000–2003: ''Lost Change'', ''Elephunk'' and ''Must B 21''===
Following the release of ''Bridging the Gap'', Will began recording his first solo release, ''[[Lost Change]]'', which was the official soundtrack to the film of the same name. Featuring collaborations with Medusa, [[Planet Asia]] and Terry Dexter, the album was a critical success.

In November 2001, work began on a third Black Eyed Peas album, ''[[Elephunk]]''. Development of the album began on November 2, 2001 and was released just under two years later in 2003. At the time of development, only will.i.am, [[apl.de.ap]] and [[Taboo (rapper)|Taboo]] were to feature on the album. During the production of "[[Shut Up (The Black Eyed Peas song)|Shut Up]]" (the second single released from the album), they realized that a female vocal would work well with the song. Originally, [[Nicole Scherzinger]] (lead singer of [[the Pussycat Dolls]]) was approached to make a guest appearance on the record. She was forced to decline because she already was signed to a contract with [[Eden's Crush]]. Danté Santiago then introduced [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]] to will.i.am, whom she impressed with her vocal talents. She immediately bonded with the band and became a permanent member of the Peas, and her photo was printed onto the album cover. Lyricist Robbie Fisher, who has been working closely with the band since the beginning stages of the album, composed nine out of the fourteen tracks. In the United States, ''Elephunk'' reached number 14 on the ''[[Billboard Top 200]]'' and is their first album to chart in the top 15. It gained even more commercial success internationally, particularly in the [[UK Album Charts]] where it reached number 3. It has sold over 1.6&nbsp;million copies in the UK and 8.5&nbsp;million copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |title=Amazon Elephunk Information |website=Amazon|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00009V7RF}}</ref> The singles "[[Where Is the Love?]]" and "Shut Up" reached number 1. "[[Hey Mama (The Black Eyed Peas song)|Hey Mama]]" has been used for several advertisements including advertisements for [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[iTunes]]. "[[Let's Get It Started]]" also received universal acclaim in the media section where a cover version of the song appears in the film ''[[Hot Tub Time Machine]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hot Tub Time Machine Interview |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Interview-Hot-Tub-Time-Machine-Director-Steve-Pink-17768.html|date=March 26, 2010}}</ref> After the success of ''Elephunk'', the Peas were approached by EA games to feature some of their music on the 2004 game ''[[The Urbz: Sims in the City|The Urbz]]''. They remixed some of the tracks on Elephunk and translated it into [[Simlish]] and created new tracks for the game. They also feature in the game as playable characters.<ref>{{cite web|title=Black Eyed Peas To Feature In The Urbz: Sims In The City |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6105705.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130103011755/http://www.gamespot.com/news/6105705.html |archive-date=January 3, 2013}}</ref>

The group released their breakthrough single, "Where Is the Love?", in November 2002 (featuring [[Justin Timberlake]], although he did not appear in the video). On the strength of that single and follow-up singles like "Shut Up", ''Elephunk'' went on to sell 8.5&nbsp;million copies worldwide. During this time, Will recorded a second solo album, ''[[Must B 21]]''. In 2002, Will recorded the song "Secrets" for the soundtrack to ''[[Dexter's Laboratory: The Hip-Hop Experiment]]'', a musical accompaniment to the [[Cartoon Network]] original series. Prior to this, he had also composed the theme music for another [[Genndy Tartakovsky]] series, ''[[Samurai Jack]]''.

===2003–2006: ''Monkey Business''===
In November 2003, work began on a fourth Black Eyed Peas album, entitled ''[[Monkey Business (The Black Eyed Peas album)|Monkey Business]]'', the second album with new band member [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]]. Upon the success of ''Monkey Business'', which was released in 2005, the album was [[RIAA certification|certified]] three times [[Music recording sales certification|Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in the U.S. and has sold over 10&nbsp;million copies worldwide. The [[Canadian Recording Industry Association]] (or CRIA) has certified ''Monkey Business'' 6x Platinum, with sales of over 600,000 copies. The [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (or ARIA) has also certified ''Monkey Business'' 6x Platinum, denoting sales of over 420,000 copies. The album's tracks earned the group four 2006 [[Grammy Award]] nominations and they also won the Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group|Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]] for "Don't Phunk with My Heart". According to [[IFPI]], over 2&nbsp;million copies have been sold in Europe.<ref>[http://www.ifpi.org/site-content/platinum/platinum_intro.html] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.today/20060822101529/http://www.ifpi.org/site-content/platinum/platinum_intro.html |date=August 22, 2006}}</ref> In the UK alone, it has sold over 1&nbsp;million copies, although this is significantly lower than their sales of ''Elephunk'', which stand at over 1.6&nbsp;million copies<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigbuilderonline.com/industry-news.asp?sectionID=363&articleID=1035781 |title=Big Builder - Home Building Industry News and Archive Information |publisher=Builder Online |date=2012-02-03 |access-date=2012-03-02}}</ref> and 10&nbsp;million worldwide.
The band announced they were going to take a break to focus on their own personal projects. Will went on to produce Fergie's first solo album, ''[[The Dutchess]]'', which was released in 2006, before beginning work with [[Michael Jackson]], who had requested Will's expertise for the recording and production of his new album. Work began on the Jackson album in 2006, and continued until the singer's death in 2009, at which point will.i.am revealed that none of the material recorded during the period would be released. However, remixes recorded for Jackson's ''[[Thriller 25]]'' anniversary album were released in 2008.

===2007–2009: ''Songs About Girls'' and ''Change Is Now''===
[[File:Hancock, Crow, and will.i.am at We Are One.jpg|thumb|will.i.am with [[Sheryl Crow]] and [[Herbie Hancock]], performing at the [[We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial]] concert]]
In 2007, will.i.am announced that he had co-created an all-female soul band entitled the [[Paradiso Girls]], who he intended to work with on an upcoming solo project. The album, ''[[Songs About Girls]]'', was released in 2007. The album spawned three singles, "I Got It From My Mama", "One More Chance" and "Heartbreaker", and fared slightly better than his previous solo efforts, however, failed to shift more than 75,000 copies. Will also did a remix to the song "[[With Love (Hilary Duff song)|With Love]]" by actress and singer [[Hilary Duff]].

In 2008, will.i.am contributed the song "One Tribe" to the [[Survival International]] charity album, ''[[Songs for Survival]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/about/amazonalbum |title=Songs for Survival – Survival International |publisher=Survivalinternational.org |access-date=2010-11-12}}</ref> Also in 2008, he was featured on rapper [[Flo Rida]]'s debut album, ''[[Mail on Sunday (album)|Mail on Sunday]]'', where he produced and featured on the song "[[In the Ayer]]", and featured on [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]]'s fifth album, ''[[Here I Stand (Usher album)|Here I Stand]]''. In January 2008, will.i.am announced plans that he was masterminding a political album, ''[[Change is Now: Renewing America's Promise]]'', in support of [[Barack Obama]]'s presidential campaign. The first single, "[[Yes We Can (will.i.am song)|Yes We Can]]", featured a music video directed by [[Jesse Dylan]]. The lyrics of the song are composed almost entirely of excerpts from Obama's speech on January 8, 2008, following the [[New Hampshire primary|New Hampshire presidential primary election]]. The video features appearances from numerous celebrities and first appeared on the website for [[Dipdive]]. The video racked up three million views within a week and over four million subsequently on YouTube. On June 13, 2008, "Yes We Can" won an award at the 35th Annual Creative Arts and Entertainment Daytime Emmy Awards for "New Approaches in Daytime Entertainment".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS145884+16-Jun-2008+MW20080616 |title=will.i.am's Yes We Can Song Video Awarded Emmy(R) for New Approaches in Daytime Entertainment |work=Reuters |date=2008-06-16 |access-date=January 25, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216145227/http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS145884+16-Jun-2008+MW20080616 |archive-date=December 16, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On February 29, 2008, the album's second single, "[[We Are the Ones]]", was released on Dipdive and YouTube. The video features several celebrities chanting "O-BA-MA" as a portrayal as their hopes and wishes for Obama and his presidential campaign. On November 4, 2008, will.i.am spoke to CNN's [[Anderson Cooper]] about his support for then-Senator Obama using CNN's 'hologram' technology (actually [[tomography]]).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/showbiz/2008/11/04/will.i.am.hologram.cnn |title=Video – Breaking News Videos from |publisher=CNN |access-date=January 25, 2010}}</ref> Following the 2008 election, and Obama's victory, Will released the album's third single, "[[It's a New Day (Will.i.am song)|It's a New Day]]". The video reflects on the historical events that led to the election of the first African-American president and the public's reaction to his election. The video debuted on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''. In honor of the [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inauguration of Barack Obama]] as president, will.i.am collaborated with producer [[David Foster]] on the album's fourth single, "[[America's Song]]", with contributing vocals from [[Seal (musician)|Seal]], [[Bono]], [[Mary J.

In response to Obama's reaction following [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards controversy|Kanye West's interruption of Taylor Swift]] at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, will.i.am penned the album's fifth and final single, "The Jackass Song". It featured a sample of [[Kanye West]]'s "[[Heartless (Kanye West song)|Heartless]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dipdive.com/member/iamwill/tv/#/~/videoplayer/0/undefined/77867/~/ |title="The Jackass Song" uploaded by will.i.am |publisher=Dipdive.com |access-date=2010-11-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027090054/http://dipdive.com/member/iamwill/tv#/~/videoplayer/0/undefined/77867/~/ |archive-date=October 27, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Will wrote a blog post, which featured the song on Dipdive, and released in February 2009.<ref>{{cite web |author=iamwill |url=http://dipdive.com/member/iamwill/blog/9182 |title=Blog written by will.i.am |publisher=Dipdive.com |access-date=2010-11-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109051127/http://dipdive.com/member/iamwill/blog/9182 |archive-date=November 9, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> will.i.am attended and spoke at the [[FIRST Robotics Competition]] kickoff on January 8, 2011, declaring, "I am a FIRST fan."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtIfDC3Ih24#t=16m47s |title=FRC Kickoff 2011 Stream Recording |publisher=[[FIRST Robotics Competition|FRC]] Team 3403 |date=January 8, 2011 |access-date=January 9, 2011}}</ref> He has also named [[FIRST]] Founder [[Dean Kamen]] "one of [his] heroes" on his [[Twitter#Privacy, security and harassment|verified]] Twitter account.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/iamwill/status/23755289966682112 |title=Tweet from @iamwill |author=will.i.am |date=January 8, 2011}}</ref>

===2009–2016: Black Eyed Peas reformation, ''The E.N.D'', ''The Beginning'', and ''#willpower''===
In March 2009, will.i.am announced plans for the Black Eyed Peas to return, and within months their comeback single, "[[Boom Boom Pow]]", had reached number 1 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. They went on to have three number 1 singles before releasing their comeback album, ''The E.N.D''. The album's success warranted a second comeback album, ''The Beginning'', released in November 2010. The album spawned another three hit singles, but the band soon announced plans they were to break again, following the conclusion of their world tour. In 2009, will.i.am worked with rappers [[Flo Rida]] and [[Akon]] for Flo's second studio album, ''[[R.O.O.T.S.]]'', and recorded four tracks with Girls Aloud member [[Cheryl (singer)|Cheryl]] for her debut solo album ''[[3 Words]]''. He also worked with [[Rihanna]] on her fourth studio album, ''[[Rated R (Rihanna album)|Rated R]]'', for a track called "Photographs". In February 2010, he wrote and produced the single "[[OMG (Usher song)|OMG]]" by Usher, which appeared on Usher's seventh studio album, ''[[Raymond vs. Raymond]]''. In a YouTube video posted by YGLifeOfficial on March 15, 2010, will.i.am expressed his desire to work with [[Koreans|Korean]] [[K-pop]] girl group [[2NE1]], and help them achieve international success.<ref>{{cite web|author="" |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLcZlDMKCqk |title=Will.I.AM talks to 2NE1 |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2010-11-12}}</ref> Will has recorded a collaboration with [[Britney Spears]], "[[Big Fat Bass]]", which features on her seventh studio album, ''[[Femme Fatale (Britney Spears album)|Femme Fatale]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britneyspears.com/2011/02/britney-tweets-from-studio-with-william.php|publisher=BritneySpears.com|title=BRITNEY TWEETS FROM STUDIO WITH WILL.I.AM|date=2011-02-08}}{{Dead link|date=April 2015}}</ref>
