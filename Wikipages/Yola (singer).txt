Yola received four nominations at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards|62nd Grammy Awards]], including the all-genre [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] category.

==Early and personal life==
Yola was born in [[Bristol]], England. Her family tried to discourage her from music at a young age, as they thought it was an unrealistic career option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-50494723|title=Grammy nominee's mum 'banned her from music'|date=21 November 2019|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.popmatters.com/yola-walk-through-fire-review-2629672456.html |title=Yola's Vocals and Songwriting Are Showcased on Her Strong Debut 'Walk Through Fire' |date=22 February 2019 |website=Popmatters.com  |access-date=13 May 2019}}</ref>

==Career==
Yola's first gigs were primarily in the [[jazz]] and [[rock music]] genres. The counterpoints of these genres would go on to formulate her vocal style that is both hard and soft, smooth and raspy. It would prove to be difficult to find where she could fit in with this range of sound in her voice.

Yola spent time in her early career as a front woman for hire and feature vocalist, for DJ/producers such as [[Bugz in the Attic]], [[Duke Dumont]], [[Massive Attack]] and [[Sub Focus]]. Amongst other projects, she also worked at the production company Replay Heaven as a vocalist, writer and arranger in London.

Upon moving back to her home town of Bristol, England, she started spending time making music with some local musicians that formed a band called [[Phantom Limb (band)|Phantom Limb]]. This project ran concurrently with her time in Bugz In The Attic, Massive Attack and numerous other acts. The band disbanded in December 2012, completing two studio albums across 8 years.

Following this was a hiatus from performing after her mother died on 30 September 2013. This hiatus gave rise to Yola's solo career, as she emerged playing a guitar, and with songs that spoke to her life and sense of isolation as a black woman in music in the UK. During this hiatus, she also co-wrote top 10 song [[Turn Back Time (Sub Focus song)|''Turn Back Time'']] with DJ/producer Sub Focus, and delivered the lead vocal on International top 5 hit [[Won't Look Back (song)|''Won't Look Back'']] by Duke Dumont.

Yola released her first solo EP, ''Orphan Offering'', in 2016. In February 2019, she released her debut album ''[[Walk Through Fire (Yola album)|Walk Through Fire]]'' on [[Dan Auerbach]]'s Easy Eye Sound label, to much acclaim.<ref name="rolling">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/yola-artist-you-need-to-know-780854/ |title=Yola's Fight for Roots-Rock Freedom |first1=Jonathan |last1=Bernstein|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=19 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/21/yola-from-down-and-out-in-london-to-nashvilles-country-soul-star |title=Yola: from down and out in London to Nashville's country soul star |first=Emma |last=John |date=21 February 2019 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref><ref name="WSJ">{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/walk-through-fire-by-yola-review-across-the-great-divide-11551127972 |title=‘Walk Through Fire’ by Yola Review: Across the Great Divide |first=Barry |last=Mazor |date=25 February 2019 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]}}</ref> The album title references a fire which damaged Yola's home and she escaped.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2019/02/14/693862024/first-listen-yola-walk-through-fire |title=On Her Mighty Debut, Yola Pushes Through To 'Walk Through Fire' |website=Npr.org|access-date=13 May 2019}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] called the album "an extraordinary record, one designed to be part of a grand musical tradition, and it contains enough emotion and imagination to earn its place within that lineage."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/walk-through-fire-mw0003232038 |title=Walk Through Fire – Yola – Songs, Reviews, Credits |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=12 March 2019}}</ref> Brittney McKenna of [[NPR Music]]'s First Listen declared, "It's the work of an artist sure to stun audiences for years to come."<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/02/14/693862024/first-listen-yola-walk-through-fire|title=On Her Mighty Debut, Yola Pushes Through To 'Walk Through Fire'|website=Npr.org}}</ref> ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' stated, "The album is an introduction to a seasoned, major vocalist that stands to be remembered as a breakthrough."<ref name="WSJ" />
