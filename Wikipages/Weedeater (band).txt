== History ==
=== 1998–2003: Formation, ''... And Justice for Y'all'' and ''Sixteen Tons'' ===
The band formed in 1998 and was initially planned to be the side-project of Dave "Dixie" Collins, the band's vocalist and bassist who was occupied with his primary project [[Buzzoven]], however, the band disbanded the same year so decided to concentrate his efforts on Weedeater and made it his new primary project, recruiting members Dave "Shep" Shepherd on guitar and Keith "Keko" Kirkum on drums.<ref name="Weedeater AllMusic biography">{{cite web|title=Weedeater biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/weedeater-mn0000239768/biography|author=Eduardo Rivadavia|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=July 27, 2014}}</ref>

=== 2004–2011: ''God Luck and Good Speed'', ''Jason... The Dragon'', and injuries ===

After the release of ''Sixteen Tons'' in 2003, the band decided to leave Berserker Records and joined American metal record label [[Southern Lord Records]] and released their third album ''God Luck and Good Speed''.<ref name="God Luck and Good Speed info" /> In 2009 a deluxe double LP version on the album was also released. The band was also announced as a support act for the American heavy metal [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Down (band)|Down]].<ref name="DOWN tour">{{cite web|title=Weedeater to support DOWN on North American tour|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/weedeater-to-support-down-on-north-american-tour/|website=Blabbermouth.net|date=July 2009|publisher=Blabber Mouth|accessdate=July 27, 2014}}</ref> The band was later announced as one of the acts to play at 2010's [[Hellfest (American music festival)|Hellfest]] among the likes of [[Arch Enemy]], [[Architects (British band)|Architects]] and [[Gwar]].<ref name="Hellfest 2010">{{cite web|title=Twisted Sister, Sepultura, Arch Enemy confirmed for next year's Hellfest|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/twisted-sister-sepultura-arch-enemy-confirmed-for-next-year-s-hellfest/|website=Blabbermouth.net|date=September 30, 2009|publisher=Blabber Mouth|accessdate=July 27, 2014}}</ref>

The band entered the studio for their fourth album with producer [[Steve Albini]] in early January 2010 who also produced their last album ''God Luck and Good Speed'', and also [[Arik Roper]] designed the album cover as he did for the band's previous albums.<ref name="Band records album 4">{{cite web|title=Weedeater to enter studio this month|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/weedeater-to-enter-studio-this-month/|website=Blabbermouth.net|date=January 6, 2010|publisher=Blabber Mouth|accessdate=July 27, 2014}}</ref> Not long after they entered the studio, Dave "Dixie" Collins accidentally shot himself in the foot, blasting off one of his big toes, whilst he was cleaning his favorite [[shotgun]] and was reported to be bedridden for the next few weeks during his recovery. This ultimately led to the band postponing their recording session with Steve Albini until after their tour in March and April.<ref name="Shotgun accident">{{cite web|title=Weedeater's Dixie Dave shoots himself in the foot|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/weedeater-s-dixie-dave-shoots-himself-in-the-foot/|website=Blabbermouth.net|date=January 13, 2010|publisher=Blabber Mouth|accessdate=July 27, 2014}}</ref>

Despite the setback caused by the accident, the band announced that their next album will be titled ''Jason...The Dragon'' and was set for a release later that year, they also announced that their March/April tour will now be called the "Nine Toe" tour in reference to Collins losing his big toe in the accident.<ref name="Album Title announced 2010">{{cite web|title=Weedeater: New album title announced|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/weedeater-new-album-title-announced/|website=Blabbermouth.net|date=February 2010|publisher=Blabber Mouth|accessdate=July 27, 2014}}</ref> The band headlined again in September 2010 after a few other injuries to the band members were reported, in which Keko had torn his meniscus after returning from their previous headlining tour and Dave Shepherd had also broken his pinkie finger while supporting [[Black Cobra (band)|Black Cobra]] in Europe in July, however, did not prevent the group from returning to Albini to record the album, unlike the previous two accidents.<ref name="3rd Time's A Charm tour">{{cite web|title=Weedeater announces '3rd Time's A Charm' tour|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/weedeater-announces-3rd-time-s-a-charm-tour/|website=Blabbermouth|date=July 27, 2010|publisher=Blabber Mouth|accessdate=July 27, 2014}}</ref>
