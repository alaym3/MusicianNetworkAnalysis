'''Frenzal Rhomb''' are an Australian [[punk rock]] band that formed in 1992 in Sydney. Three of the group's albums have entered the top&nbsp;20 on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Albums Chart]]: ''[[A Man's Not a Camel]]'' (1999), ''[[Hi-Vis High Tea]]'' (2017) and ''[[Smoko at the Pet Food Factory]]'' (2011). ''[[Hi-Vis High Tea]]'' reached 9th position in the charts. The group has supported Australian tours by [[The Offspring]], [[Bad Religion]], [[NOFX]], and [[Blink-182]]. Frenzal Rhomb have also toured in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, South Africa, Israel and Taiwan. The band has undergone several line-up changes, with lead vocalist Jason Whalley serving as the band's sole constant member.

==History==
===1992–1995: Formation to ''Coughing Up a Storm''===
Frenzal Rhomb formed in 1992 in the Sydney suburb of [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]] with Alexis 'Lex' Feltham on bass guitar and Jason Whalley on vocals.<ref name="Nim"/><ref name="McF"/> Feltham and Whalley had been school mates at [[St Ives High School]] in [[St Ives, New South Wales|St Ives]].<ref name="Nim"/><ref name="Delaney"/> Whalley had commenced a Bachelor of Arts course in philosophy at [[Sydney University]] when he formed Frenzal Rhomb as a punk rock band. The band was formed to take part in a battle of the bands and at that stage was not seen as a permanent project. The name is a reference to a band member's pet rat, who in turn was named for the [[Fresnel rhomb]], which is a prism-like device invented by the 19th Century French engineer, [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]].<ref name="J Play bio">{{cite web|title=Frenzal Rhomb biography|url=http://www.jplay.com.au/JSite/ViewArtist.aspx?ArtistID=382&ShowFullBio=true|website=J Play|archive-date=14 September 2008|access-date=16 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914015138/http://www.jplay.com.au/JSite/ViewArtist.aspx?ArtistID=382&ShowFullBio=true|quote=The question that Frenzal Rhomb get asked the most, apart from "Can you wear your underpants on stage and still be taken seriously?" would have to be "what does Friends of Ron mean?" The answer is rarely the same, but to clear up any confusion here is an adequate response to the one question they never expect to be asked again. Early in 1994 the lads named the band after Jason's rat who in turn had been named after French scientist Augustus Fresnel, whose contribution to the world was the invention of a light refracting box – the Fresnel Rhomb.}}</ref> By 1993, the group's line-up was Feltham, Whalley, Ben Costello on guitar and Karl Perske on drums.<ref name="Nim"/><ref name="McF"/> They played at the Sydney venue for the [[Big Day Out]] in January.<ref name="Delaney"/>

In March 1994, the band issued a seven-track EP, ''[[Dick Sandwich]]''.<ref name="Nim"/> Its cover had "a graphic drawing of the offending flaccid appendage draped over a sesame seed bun with lashings of bloody sauce."<ref name="Nim"/> Posters with a similar image that advertised the group had them banned at some venues.<ref name="Nim"/> National youth radio station [[Triple J]] criticised the group as being immature and told them to "grow up". The EP was described as having "good songs but it sounds like it was recorded under a doona" and had the group banned from some radio stations and retail outlets.<ref name="MABio"/> One of its tracks, "I Wish I Was as Credible as Roger Climpson" (aka "Roger"), attracted attention of its subject, [[Roger Climpson]] – a ''[[Seven News]]'' anchor on TV – who posed with the group for a photo.<ref name="Nim"/> The E.P also features fan favourites "Chemotherapy", and a cover of the TV series theme "Home And Away". The E.P featured an alternate cover depicting rabbits on the flipside of the liftout to appease record stores or people who may have been offended by the original artwork. In October of that year, they released a single, "Sorry About the Ruse", on their own label, How Much Did I Fucking Pay For This Records?<ref name="FrenzalDiscog"/> The group were the local support act on the Australian leg of separate tours by United States punk rockers [[Bad Religion]], [[The Offspring]], and [[Blink-182]].<ref name="Bush"/>

In March 1995, Frenzal Rhomb released their first studio album, ''[[Coughing Up a Storm]]'', on [[Shock Records]]' sub-label Shagpile Records.<ref name="Nim"/><ref name="Bush"/> Perske was replaced by Nat Nykyruj on drums before the album appeared.<ref name="Nim"/> The album features live fan favourite "Genius". In October 1997, it was retitled ''Once a Jolly Swagman Always a Jolly Swagman'' and issued with additional tracks by the US label [[Liberation Records]]. In mid-1995, the group supported [[NOFX]] on their national tour.<ref name="McF"/> [[Fat Mike]], a member of NOFX, was also the owner of [[Fat Wreck Chords]], and he signed the band to his label, which released the ''4 Litres'' EP in the US.<ref name="Nim"/><ref name="McF"/>

===1996–2000: ''Not So Tough Now'' to ''A Man's Not a Camel''===
In July 1996, Frenzal Rhomb released their second album, ''[[Not So Tough Now]]'', which was produced by [[Tony Cohen]] ([[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]], [[TISM]], [[Dave Graney]]),<ref name="HolmTC"/> [[Kalju Tonuma]] ([[Nick Barker]], [[The Mavis's]])<ref name="HolmKT"/> and Frenzal Rhomb.<ref name="NotSo"/> Just after its appearance, Costello was replaced by [[Lindsay McDougall]] on lead guitar and backing vocals – Costello left to attend university and become an animal rights activist.<ref name="Nim"/><ref name="McF"/> In November, the group issued a CD EP, ''Punch in the Face'' and, in January 1997, performed at Big Day Out.<ref name="McF"/> Late that year they toured the US supporting Blink-182.<ref name="McF"/>

In September 1997, their third LP, ''[[Meet the Family (album)|Meet the Family]]'', was released, which reached the top&nbsp;40 on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Albums Chart]] and became their first certified gold album by ARIA.<ref name="AUSCharts"/><ref name="ARIACert1999"/> It spawned three singles, "Mr Charisma" (June), "There's Your Dad" (September), and "Mum Changed the Locks" (April 1998).<ref name="McF"/> The latter title refers to McDougall telling his mother he was going out to a movie when leaving for an interstate tour and returning to find his key no longer opened the front door.<ref name="Nim"/> Also in April, Gordon "Gordy" Forman replaced Nykyruj on drums, and they toured Australia with US ska band [[Blue Meanies (Illinois band)|Blue Meanies]].<ref name="McF"/> Frenzal Rhomb were the head-liners for the Australian leg of the 1998 [[Warped Tour|Vans Warped Tour]] and they were recruited for the US edition. A 1998 version of ''Meet the Family'' contained a bonus disc, ''Mongrel'', that was recorded live on this US leg.<ref name="Nim"/><ref name="McF"/>

In March 1999, they released their next album, ''[[A Man's Not a Camel]]'', which was produced by [[Eddie Ashworth]] and was supported by a nationwide tour.<ref name="Nim"/><ref name="McF"/><ref name="MansNot"/> As from November 2011, it remains Frenzal Rhomb's highest charting album, reaching No.&nbsp;11.<ref name="AUSCharts"/> It spawned their highest charting single, "You Are Not My Friend" (August), which reached No.&nbsp;49.<ref name="AUSCharts"/> [[Allmusic]]'s album reviewer Mike DaRonco felt "the first two songs are great in that catchy, playful pop-punk sort of way, but the rest ... fall under the trap of having all their tracks sounding like one big, long song".<ref name="DaRonco"/> The album also features fan favourites "We're Going Out Tonight" and "Never Had So Much Fun".

At the [[ARIA Music Awards of 1999]] in October, the group performed "Never Had So Much Fun". In 2019 Dan Condon of [[Double J (radio station)|Double J]] described this as one of "7 great performances from the history of the ARIA Awards."<ref name="Condon">{{cite web | url = https://www.abc.net.au/doublej/music-reads/features/aria-awards-musical-highlights/11738898 | title = 7 Great Performances from the History of the ARIA Awards – Music Reads | last = Condon | first = Dan | publisher = [[Double J (radio station)|Double J]] | date = 26 November 2019 | access-date = 24 December 2020 }}</ref> According to the band's website, US gigs were dropped after Whalley suffered a heart attack in late 1999 and the group spent the first few months of 2000 inactive.<ref name="Frenzal2002"/> Whalley later denied that he had had a heart attack with "a lot of things on our Web site are greatly exaggerated. There was also a thing about my having trench rot, the World War I disease, but that's not true either".<ref name="Frazier"/>

===2000–2003: ''Shut Your Mouth'' to ''Sans Souci''===
In November 2000, Frenzal Rhomb returned with the album ''[[Shut Your Mouth (album)|Shut Your Mouth]]'', released on [[Epic Records]] in Australia, an offshoot of [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]].<ref name="Nim"/><ref name="McF"/> RockZone's Samuel Barker liked some tracks as "a fine template for a pop punk album" however "the majority just falls into the same formula of most punk today. It's not bad, just overplayed".<ref name="Barker"/> The album peaked in the top&nbsp;40.<ref name="AUSCharts"/> After six months, Sony dropped the band in mid-2001 and they signed with [[Epitaph Records]] in Australia.<ref name="Frenzal2002"/>

In April 2002, Feltham left the group, which provided many stories about why he left, including one that he was fired after thinking that the group should incorporate [[synth]] and keyboard work. The last song he recorded with the band was a cover of [[Midnight Oil]]'s "[[The Dead Heart]]" for the 2001 tribute album ''[[The Power & The Passion|Power & The Passion: A Tribute to Midnight Oil]]''. After holding auditions in Sydney, Tom Crease was announced as the new bass guitarist.

In April 2003, the band released ''[[Sans Souci (album)|Sans Souci]]'', which appeared in the top&nbsp;50.<ref name="AUSCharts"/> Jo-Ann Greene of Allmusic liked the group's outlook: "they're not bitter, just snotty about it all, as all good punks should be. And Rhomb are four of the best ... their latest set of frenzied, funny, pitiless attacks upon an uncaring planet."<ref name="Greene"/> The initial version of the album included a bonus DVD of five tracks with live footage and music videos.

===2004: Political protest, Jackie O===
During 2003, Frenzal Rhomb's McDougall organised ''[[Rock Against Howard]]'', a compilation album, by various Australian musicians as a protest against incumbent Prime Minister [[John Howard]]'s government. It was released in August 2004, before the [[2004 Australian federal election|October federal election]], when Howard's coalition was re-elected.<ref name="Trees"/><ref name="SMH2004"/>

In July 2004, radio station [[2Day FM]] presenter [[Jackie O (radio host)|Jackie O]] was to MC at the [[Bassinthegrass]] festival in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]].<ref name="MediaWatch"/> Jackie allegedly arrived late, causing Frenzal Rhomb to cut their setlist short by several songs. She attempted to speak with the audience. In protest, McDougall began playing [[AC/DC]]'s "[[Thunderstruck (song)|Thunderstruck]]" over her voice. Jackie was upset that she was unable to finish her announcement to the audience. Whalley later accused her and other music industry personalities of pushing original Australian bands aside to make way for short-term marketable acts such as ''[[Australian Idol]]'' and ''[[Popstars]]'' contestants.

Jackie and her co-presenter, [[Kyle Sandilands]], called Whalley on air during their next breakfast show. Whalley apologised for offending Jackie, but stood by his claims regarding the music industry. The conversation became heated as Sandilands told Whalley "Your songs being played on this network or the Triple M network... it's just not going to happen now"; to which Whalley argued that Frenzal Rhomb were almost never played on the [[Southern Cross Austereo|Austereo network]] anyway. During the conversation, Sandilands told Whalley that he was bitter and sad. When Whalley pointed out that Sandilands is in a position to promote new Australian music but doesn't, Sandilands countered that Frenzal Rhomb is not played on the network "because it's pretty much shit".<ref name="MediaWatch"/> While Sandilands agreed that shows like Popstars and Australian Idol are interested in making "a quick buck", he also asserted that he doesn't "care about Australian Idol or Popstars".

Sandilands argued that Whalley should not "pick fights with people that are female in the Northern Territory". Sandilands asserted that if he himself were present, "it would have been on for young and old". Whalley argued that gender was irrelevant to the issue, and in response to Sandilands' threat of violence asked Jackie if she was aware that her security guard had threatened a band technician with violence. Sandilands said he endorsed the threat of violence. Sandilands argued to Whalley that he has to "get over it" when Whalley recommended that radio DJs should promote original Australian music. In reply, Sandilands insinuated that Frenzal Rhomb, and bands in general, suffer from a lack of support because they are not "putting [their] stuff in front of the right people".<ref name="MediaWatch"/>

ABC Television's ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'' covered the exchange and presenter [[David Marr (journalist)|David Marr]] raised concerns about the interview: "Kyle and Jackie O are also part of a new generation of radio thugs". Patrick Joyce, general manager of Austereo in Sydney, responded to Sandilands' threats of [[black list]]ing and violence, "Music content is decided by the programming directors based on research of the market... Austereo does not approve of threats being made to anyone... We have fully canvassed these issues with Kyle".<ref name="MediaWatch"/>

===2005–2009: Jay and the Doctor and ''Forever Malcolm Young''===
{{Main|Jay and the Doctor}}
Frenzal Rhomb's Whalley and McDougall worked as [[Jay and the Doctor]] on Triple J's breakfast show from January 2005 through to November 2007. Prior to their employment at Triple J, the group's music had been banned after they had earlier criticised the station on air for playing the "same 40 songs". In 2004, they were asked to perform occasional late night shifts and request segments, which developed into the breakfast show slot. Their format includes banter where they provide "quips, one-liners, slagging off each other, other bands, other breakfast announcers, listeners, Triple J, ''Australian Idol'' and St Ives. It's verbal ping pong but more discursive."<ref name="Delaney"/>

The band released ''[[Forever Malcolm Young]]'' in October 2006 – the title is a conflated reference to the 2005 song "[[Forever Young (Youth Group song)|Forever Young]]" by [[Youth Group]] and the name of AC/DC's guitarist, [[Malcolm Young]] – which peaked in the top&nbsp;40.<ref name="AUSCharts"/> It provided a minor radio hit with the title track. Some controversy was expressed over the profanity in the title and lyrics of "Johnny Ramone was in a Fucking Good Band, but He Was a Cunt" (see [[Johnny Ramone]], [[Ramones]]). Whalley's attitude to profanity and obscenity is "I often get amazed how offended people get by language, especially in Australia when its nothing you wouldn't hear in your local office or schoolyard. But we do make a point of shaking things up".<ref name="Frazier"/> Australian rock music journalist [[Ed Nimmervoll]] described them "[their] history is littered with legendary stories, perhaps true, perhaps exaggerations, but stories which fuel and match their song and album titles. Their songs are often profane, likely to poke fun at someone including themselves, hint at a social conscience, and inside all the tough talk and body jokes be hopelessly romantic."<ref name="Nim"/>

National touring followed the album's release, along with the announcement that from November 2007 Whalley would be leaving both Frenzal Rhomb and his job at Triple J to go on a world trip with his girlfriend. Some later copies of ''Forever Malcolm Young'' contained a bonus DVD covering the band's tours from 2002 up until 2005. It is titled ''Sucking All Over the World''. Gordy Forman plays in the Melbourne hardcore band [[Mindsnare]]. McDougall continued as The Doctor at Triple J, initially with [[Robbie Buck]] and [[Marieke Hardy]]; and, from January 2010, he has hosted the afternoon show ''Drive with The Doctor''.<ref name="Mumbrella"/> By April 2009, Frenzal Rhomb were performing The Boys Are Back in Town tour with 1990s punk group [[Nancy Vandal]] as their support act.<ref name="Kovacevic"/>

===2010–2017: ''Smoko at the Pet Food Factory'' and ''We Lived Like Kings...''===

In December 2010, Frenzal Rhomb embarked on the [[No Sleep Til Festival]] which featured punk and metal bands: [[Megadeth]], [[Descendents]], [[NOFX]], [[Gwar]] and [[Dropkick Murphys]].<ref name="SMHNoSleep"/> Frenzal Rhomb played a new song entitled "Bird Attack". In Brisbane, on the last stop of the tour, Whalley and Crease joined Descendents on-stage with other bands' singers – [[Al Barr]] (Dropkick Murphys), Fat Mike (NOFX), [[Matt Skiba]] and [[Derek Grant (drummer)|Derek Grant]] ([[Alkaline Trio]]), and Jason Allen (Descendents' road manager) – to perform "Everything Sux".<ref name="Pass"/>

Frenzal Rhomb recorded their next album, ''[[Smoko at the Pet Food Factory]]'' in Colorado with [[Bill Stevenson (musician)|Bill Stevenson]] (drummer for Descendents) producing.<ref name="Bomber"/> It was released on 19 August 2011 on [[Shock Records]], which peaked at No.&nbsp;14.<ref name="AUSCharts"/> The group toured Australia with [[Teenage Bottlerocket]] in September in support of the album.<ref name="Bomber"/>

In June 2012, the album 'Not So Tough Now' was certified gold by the Australia Record Industry Association, 16 years after its release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/httpwww.aria.com.aupagesALBUMaccreds2012.htm |title=ARIA Charts – Accreditations – 2012 Albums |website=Aria.com.au |date=3 December 2012|access-date=11 February 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205035631/http://www.aria.com.au/pages/httpwww.aria.com.aupagesALBUMaccreds2012.htm |archive-date=5 February 2014  }}</ref>

Lead singer Jay Whalley announced on 26 February 2013 that the group was forced to cancel its recent tour after surgeons discovered and removed a [[Taenia solium|pig tapeworm egg]] from his brain.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frenzal Rhomb frontman Jay Whalley reveals pig tapeworm egg infected his brain|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/frenzal-rhomb-frontman-jay-whalley-reveals-pig-tapeworm-egg-infected-his-brain/story-e6frfn09-1226587106839#ixzz2M80Gdh5N|publisher=news.com.au|access-date=27 February 2013}}</ref>

Drummer Gordy Foreman broke his arm in multiple places after stage diving during a performance in Perth in 2015 and spent about 18 months recovering. The band continued to play live with Kye Smith (of Local Resident Failure) filling in on drums. Smith had previously paid tribute to Frenzal Rhomb as part of his "5 Minute Drum Chronology" series on YouTube.

To celebrate the band's 25th anniversary Frenzal Rhomb toured Australia in 2016. Fans were offered the opportunity to select songs in the set list by voting for their favourite songs on the band's Facebook page. The band also released a best-of album, entitled ''We Lived Like Kings, We Did Anything We Wanted'', on 19 August.

===2017–present: ''Hi-Vis High Tea''===

Frenzal Rhomb's ninth studio album, ''Hi-Vis High Tea'', was released on 26 May 2017 on CD, LP (vinyl) and digital download. It was once again recorded in The Blasting Room by Bill Stevenson. The album's first single, "Cunt Act," was released on the same day; as well as a national run of dates with [[Totally Unicorn]].

After 17 years, Tom Crease departed the band in mid-2019 due to ongoing hearing problems. He was replaced by Michael "Dal" Dallinger, formerly of Newcastle punk band Local Resident Failure – coincidentally, a band named after a Frenzal Rhomb song.

==Controversy==
The group has generated controversy for [[profanity]] in cover art, song titles and lyrics; for the behaviour of members, on and off stage.

In July 2004, radio [[2Day FM]] hosts [[Jackie O (radio host)|Jackie O]] and [[Kyle Sandilands]] (themselves no strangers to controversy) threatened the band with "[[blacklist|black-listing]]" from the [[Southern Cross Austereo|Austereo network]] after a festival performance in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Australia in a [[tit for tat]]. The band had played AC/DC's "Thunderstruck" over the top of Jackie O's effort to explain her late appearance to the audience as the delay caused a further cut into the band's set time.
